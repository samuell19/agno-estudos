On your way back... ...get me the latest women's magazines from Balan's shop - I'll pay you when you get back - Ok - Where are you off to? - To the hospital I have a bad case of dizziness and back ache So why are you alone? You should have asked one of the kids to take you If I ask, they will take me But I don't like asking for favours Till I die, I would like to manage things on my own Hey! Babu - since you are in bad health yourself... - I'll buy a lottery from you - I have 'Karunya' and 'Bumper' tickets Not those!

Stop pushing it around...check now...its 27, right? It's a bit short of 27 - If you start mixing shreds, you will bring down the prices! - What? I had sifted all that out! Maybe Gracy put it in accidentally - Hmm - Give me 500 now, please! Use Rs.290 to recharge your phone... the rest for bus fare - What about my hostel fees? - I will put it in your account by Saturday - Ok, so long as you do it! - Call home as soon as you reach - Ok - Stop holding the money and just give it to her - Easy for you to say! And take a state transport bus... those will be direct...go now... Varkeycha...that will be 2 kgs... and 300gms... - Your sisters left after the memorial service? - They left yesterday itself I tell them...mother is getting old... keep her company for a few days... ...but they can't! And there is no end to their lectures! - Here - That is the situation they are in Once they get married, it's all in their husband's hands You shouldn't expect more from them I am not complaining. Everyone has their own troubles - Leaving? - I need to drop in at the Agriculture office - So what's the price, Varkey? - There's no change... same as last week - Sure From their observations so far... ...they haven't found another plant related to this one yet So I feel there is a chance for us - So what should I do now? - You don't have to do anything We will send our samples to the Spices Board Research Centre... ...and have it's oil content determined With that, our part is done - Let me know if you hear something. I am leaving now - Ok Oh no! Oh no! I am doomed! - What is it? What happened? - I am safe for another round! False alarm! - What was it? - Nothing...he's just crazy! - I was scared - Me too! - Look at this call - Hmm? The number ends in 496...I get messages too The 'Hi' 'Hello' 'How are you?' type - Send a reply - What for? - Just for fun...we can find out who it is - I don't think that is necessary What if you get a new boyfriend or something? - Move! - What is it, Betsy? - What is it? - Nothing - What is it? - Here...take your money - What is going on, Betsy? - Will you stop it please? - I don't want it - Come on, Betsy! - But you need it for hostel fees - I dont want it - Stop it, Betsy! Please! Stop it! I was just joking! - I am not angry. I just don't want it - Don't go, Betsy. Please sit down - Please sit down and listen to me - I am leaving - What did I do? - You said you would drop me at Kottayam...and did you? I can't just let that PUBG-playing idiot run the shop - Such a responsible guy! - I am not too sure about what that officer said Why do you say that? Farmers these days are committing suicide And that's when you come up with this discovery...that too organic! But anyone can do this! They don't do it because the government... ...does not ensure them a fair price - Open the bag, Betsy! - Where is he? - Oh no! What's going on here? Nothing...Betsy needed a photostat - Of what? These sweets? - No... Why are you here? Weren't you supposed to go to Kottayam? I missed the bus, brother The next one is only at 11.30 - And did you call your Dad to tell him that? - No So shall I call and tell him that you are waiting here for the bus? - He wouldn't have gone home yet - No! Please don't, brother! He thinks I left Heard that? Haven't I told you to keep your dealings out of this place? - Please...Sleeva...we were just... - Let it go, Sleeva... - We won't be seeing each other for a while...that's why - Stop talking! I understood what's going on here! Get on the bus and call your Dad immediately! - What? - The sweets! - I'll get you later! - Huh? - Betsy! So they were eating sweets inside? This is why they say you shouldn't do favours for friends! If it was anyone else, they would've had it from me! You know how many times I've told him not to do this If there is a problem, I will be held answerable! - That too with a girl involved! - They're just kids! It's just the age! This has nothing to do with age! It is the parent's lack of attention - He should have put his daughter in the bus himself! - Just have one, will you? Here! Why talk about unnecessary things? Keep this, Betsy...they are sweet pears What if he calls my Dad? - We'll.... - (Lottery seller calling out) (Lottery seller continues) I don't think...he will call I will deal with Sleeva. Don't worry about it, ok? - Anyone in this seat? - No Keep this, Betsy I'll call you I think I should definitely call her Dad Just think about his situation Does he even know what's going on? He should've learned from my Dad! He was so strict! Why aren't you saying anything? This is not as trivial as you think - It's a serious issue! - You're right! See? Now you get it! Mother! Mother! Mother? Hey! Did Mother come to your place? No...she's not here She wouldn't go there without telling me Ok, let me check Oh no! Mother! Sit up! Mother...sit up! What happened? Mother! Look at me! Look! Mother! What happened to you? Come on! What happened to you? Mother! Where is Mother? Where is she? She way lying unconscious in the kitchen Oh no! Mother! - What happened, Mother? - It's nothing, my child! - I felt dizzy, that's all - Did you hit your head or something? - No - Let's go to the hospital - No - Lily? - Yes? - Get me that medicine - Ok - I'll get it right away - And where were you gone, Kuttayi? How many times have I told you not to leave her alone for long? Either come home before dusk....or ensure there is someone at home You never seem to understand! Mother was lying senseless on that cold floor for a long time yesterday It wasn't like that...Lily was there till late evening Then Mother told her to go home because the boy was alone And I had gone to the city But...Gopi Cheta*...you should have seen her lying there (*Elder brother) Think about it...the house used to be so full of people! And now Mother is all alone! With no one for company! It's a terrible situation to be in What's the point of anything if we can't care for our elders? Well! That's up to you to decide, really! There! That one! Try it from the other side! - But I am not getting the right grip! - This side! This side! Come on! - Pull it! Pull it now! - Shall I? - Yes! Pull! - Watch out! The sickle's come off! - Holy Mother! You and your knots! How come it's never tight enough? - It's not tight enough - Go and get another string - ok Why is he here so early? The sickle came loose just when I was about to get the jackfruit What's up? Why are you picking these? These cocoas look bitten With all the rats and civet cats, I am not getting many these days - Didn't get into town today? - Why don't you try some pesticide? I have told someone...he is supposed to come on Sunday - So why are you here? - Why don't you get a trap for the civets? Why are you beating around the bush? - Just tell me what's up - I want to tie the knot - Here! Go ahead! - Not this! - I mean, I want to get married - Why the sudden realisation? I've been thinking. There should be someone at home How many good proposals have I brought to you? You kept finding excuses to blow them away Just six months ago, I brought you a proposal of a really smart girl What was it you said then? That you could take care of your parents on your own - That you didn't need anyone else! - That was then If you have any proposals in hand now, let me know Well, that girl is married! Where will I find another like her? And here's the thing - I won't go around meeting a lot of girls I understand...let me look for one that is suitable to your family But it's a good thing you finally took this decision At least my sisters can stop complaining! Where's the string, woman? But will he agree? - He agreed, Mother - Oh? - And I told our Priest about it That's when the Priest came forward with a proposal. It's for his niece They are from Angamaly...and the girl is really smart - Tell her, Father - Her family was in Bangalore They've been living in Angamaly for two years now The girl's Dad - my brother-in-law- died when she was really young And her mother is presently bed-ridden after a stroke The girl takes care of everything at home - And what does her brother do? - He and his wife work in the Gulf Both are nurses. They are home on vacation now They are actively looking for a groom for her right now - What's her name? - Rincy - She is well suited for Sleeva - Oh really? Kuttyacha... ...let's not delay it. Please take him along to meet the girl Richard...this is not like last time Make your own enquiries about the groom He is an only child! Ok...but let them decide if they like each other first - Was the route difficult? I haven't talked about other matters wth them. That's for you to discuss - Rincy will get her fair share. Don't worry about it - And me? - Wait! - Alright then - We'll see you later - Shall we? - Ok - See you! I'll be in touch with your Dad - Ok! Alright - Hello? Richard? - Yes - I am Kuttychan - Oh ok - We are coming to meet your sister... Father Eldhos sent us - Oh... - We are now...isn't this Angamaly? - Yes We have reached Angamaly - If you could give us the exact directions to your place... - Oh...yes.... After Angamaly Little Flower Hospital. you will see TB road to the right Call me when you reach that road Ok...alright... - Who was that? - That... You remember that boy Father Eldhos mentioned? They are on their way here....they are near the hospital So let them come...let them meet the girl - And? - And what? Call them in two days and say the girl is not interested - We will leave immediately after meeting her, ok? - Yes...alright - Are you Richard? - Yes and you are...Kuttychan? - Yes - And the groom? - This is him Please come in That boy Uncle spoke of, has dropped in - Just come and talk to him - Let him meet the girl and send him away What's the point in all of us meeting him? Come and talk to him...there's an elderly man with him too - Just come! - I am Kuttychan I look after the accounts in Father Eldhos's Church And this is Sleeva - What do you do? - Farming - Farming? What kind? - All kinds! It's mainly rubber and pepper Also coconut palms, arecanut palms, cocoa.... He owns 65 acres of land - Ok... - Also, in the Kallaara town area... ...he owns a three-storeyed building. That's rented out He could live off the rent alone Why are you nudging me? I am only saying it as it is! He has four sisters...all older than him They were all married off and honourably settled by his Dad Now it's just his Mother and him at home Speaking of my mother...I heard your mother is not keeping well - Father Eldhos said so - That's right. He had mentioned it - That's true - Can I see her? - Huh? - Should we let him? - Sure, why not? - Who's this? - Who knows? - Mother...they are... - ...they are.... - Hello How're you feeling, Mother? Have a lot of medicines? - Better - She is being treated by Dr Mathew Philip at the Medical Center He is good...now she has physiotherapy going on And she is showing improvement, right? Why is this room all closed up? The rooms sick people lie in... ...there should be plenty of air flow If you just let these windows open... ...she'll feel better already! - Am I right, Mother? - Who are you, Son? - Do I know you? - I am Sleeva - I am here to meet your daughter - From the High Range What is bothering you now, Mother? The feet seem darkened - Can you feel it when I press your leg? - No - It's because her blood flow is not good - Hmm There's mix of touch-me-nots, Deodar and 'karimkurinji' herbs... ...if you have that boiled with dried ginger... ...it will really get your blood going! But unlike our place, you won't get those things in these parts Really? These herbs grow all over our place! The next time someone comes down, I'll... or wait... ...you should come there! You should see how great it is! The fresh air...and plentiful sunlight... Just being there will make you halfway better! Father Eldhos had told me about you Alright then, Mother...you take rest. We are leaving Next time, I am taking you home with me! - Are you leaving? Let me get you something to drink! - No, please, aunty! No coffee or tea please! - We had tea on the way - Hey! You should at least have some water! We came here to meet a girl! That's the proper etiquette There's the girl...if you want to talk to her, you can stand aside and talk What? I have nothing to take her aside for! I have a Mother just like yours...just be sure to care for her like your own! So that is what Sleeva has to say! Now it's up to you to decide Call Father Eldhos when you have made up your mind We'll take our leave now Listen...you ask first, ok? - What? - Nothing - What? What is it, Mother? - (whispering) Ask, ask Uncle, what did you think of the girl? Did you like her? - Yes...I liked her - What's she look like? She looks... - Does she look like anyone we know? - Anyone we... - How long is her hair? Well...the hair...I guess she has hair - Is she tall? - Tall...? - I didn't look that closely - You didn't look? Then what did you do exactly? Mother, call up Kuttychan - Then we can really know - Leave it, Mom! Let Uncle speak - You speak, Uncle - Mother, he has no experience meeting girls We shouldn't go by only what he says. We should all go and meet the girl... ...before we take a decision What does that mean? Doesn't my opinion count? - That's ridiculous! - Be quiet now. We only need his opinion on this Kuttayi...Father Eldhos called They like you They said we can have the wedding soon if you agree What do you mean? We need to know what our future sister-in-law is like! You! Get that phone and call your aunts Child! Take your mother home Just call, ok? Kuttayi...what is the family like? Don't ask me, Mother! Let them decide - my sisters! I don't have anything more to say She has long hair...but does she look a bit small? She looks small to me...you take a look I don't think so...she looks slim... and really fair - She'll be good for Kuttayi - We can't really say much from a pic My husband seemed so fair in his pics! Yes, that's right...how about day after? That is, the 27th...we are planning to come over... Nine of us including the driver True...I don't think the Priest can come He is busy organising the Retreat Yes...yes... We'll call before we come Hello? I am at Gopi's place right now You're reached? Ok And by the way...you know Sleeva... of Kadaplamattam... He has finally found a girl! It's Shiny! What are you getting as dowry? - Nothing at all...the only factor was his interest - Oh! Ok I need to get going now If you a stay a while longer, you can join us for lunch Oh no! If I dont get home quick, she will make a fuss! - I will be dropping in to invite you for the wedding - Oh! Ok...ok... Why do you look so grim? - I guess it's the wedding...so much to do! - That's true! - Alright, you can leave my hand now... I can manage - Ok - Hello? - Hello! - Who is this? - I am... - Shiny? No...it's Rincy - Oh...alright...just hold on...I'll pass the phone to Mother - Ok - Who's it son? - From Angamaly - Who? - It's Rincy - Oh! Hello? - My child! How are you doing? - What should we do about the buffalos? - You know that area down in Uppukunnu? - Yes - (Mother talking in background) - Down there they have excellent buffalos Let's buy two of those We have completed some very important discussions in this... ...pre-marital counselling session We have already talked about love and trust in a marriage Now we are going to talk abut something that is even more important And that is about physical intimacy in a marriage There are many myths in the minds of youngsters today... ...relating to sexuality Sister...is it a sin to involve in sexual relations before marriage? That's a good question - What's your name? - Monson - Sit down, please Sexuality outside of marriage... ...by anyone...is wrong Love is to be shared... Yes...hello Sleeva... Here for your pre-marital confession? You stand before the Priest, who is the conduit of God... ...to confess your sins...you may now relate all your sins that you can think of Father... ...I have never done anything that was against my conscience I've never given cause...for anyone... - ... to point fingers at me - I know that, Sleeva But...right now, I am under a lot of anxiety What is troubling you? Tell me Father...I have never... ...looked at any girl in a wrong manner I have never behaved badly with anyone - And that's what is troubling you? - You don't understand It's not a small thing...it's a matter of great importance - What are you trying to say? - Father... ...about...about what to do after marriage...I don't know anything about it I have no clue about it...it makes me tremble to think about it! That's it? That's a trivial issue, Sleeva Most people who are about to get married have this fear Both men and women have that fear It's just a feeling...once you start living together... ...and spend time together, this fear will automatically disappear Sleeva...people like you...are rare these days I consider it my Rincy's good fortune to get a man like you You shouldn't worry this. Keep up the prayers and be calm Go and read Psalm 112 twice... ...and attend Holy Mass. I will pray for you Let's try something new today, ok? What's up, guys? Have you heard?

I got into a little mess...all the other guys who were to put up posters left - I had to do it myself - Couldn't you have called if you were not coming at night? Why else do you carry that thing? This poor child waited up till midnight She made me call every friend of yours I did call...to say I wouldn't be coming You said you'd come home soon - Mother...who puts up the Church posters every year? - That's you and the guys - It is, right? - Yes - Then there was no need to worry - Was there? - No - Did I do anything wrong? - No - So what's the issue? - And are you done with the posters?

We'll talk in the evening...come... - Come, come! - What a grip was that! That was rough! Why didn't you play today, Sleeva? I've been noticing it since you came... anything wrong? - There seems to be something bothering you - Tired! He's just tired! Ever since the wedding, he rarely comes out of his home anymore! For a while, it will be like this When I got married, I shut the shop and stayed home for two months! - No wonder your wife left you! - Shut up, you fool! - Good thing she left! - Girls these days are double strong! I am saying from personal experience - it is not easy! - First quit smoking - Ok Exercise for two hours every morning - And? - And you will be as strong as an ox Anyhow, you made a big mistake right in the start You should never have married a girl from town - There isn't any girl there who hasn't already had a few boyfriends - That's true - And those boyfriends are always the crazy types - You got that right! And to stand out from those crazy guys, we need to prove ourselves smarter We need to impress the girls with our strength Or else they won't respect us - What do you put on your face? - Nothing, really, Chechi Don't go out in the sun and ruin your complexion For God's sake, Chechi! Is there nothing other than chicken curry here? There is some spinach curry there for you Any time we come, Kuttayi is not home! I had to go to the city for something What happened at the agriculture office? There are a lot of complicated procedures It's all up to the officers - He has changed, hasn't he? - But see how happy he is! I don't even mind if I die now! What...did you want to talk to me about? - What you said in the morning... - Oh that... That was nothing - I just thought you were not coming home again - Oh Lord! I am not going anywhere today...I want to make up for making you upset Did you...feel anything else about me? No...why did you ask that? Just...a feeling... I'll be right back...I need a shower...have you showered? - Can you pass that, Aliya? - Give me the glass - Oh is it spinach? - Will you have a bit of this? - Give me some of that - This? - Yes but just a bit - Hey!

Get some more of that curry! - And I need some water too - There is water right here! - Did Aliyan go to bed? - He is watching TV Don't these people sleep? - We are going to the Retreat tomorrow, right? - Of course!

I did not get you If Mother calls again, don't pick up Oh! Today is the start of the Retreat, right? You're trying to get out of it, aren't you? - Do you have any money on you? - How much do you need? - How much do you have? - Nothing...I was just asking... I am in a tight spot too, Sleeva. I am trying to take a loan for a personal need I am just going out...you will be here, right? If you are leaving, please put the shutters down Wait...take this... Can you...pawn this for me? Isn't that your wedding ring? What is the big emergency? There is some stuff...get me whatever money you can And get a full bottle of alcohol on your way back - Full? - Yes? - So you are planning to get drunk in the morning? I thought as much when I saw you. Anyhow, ok... First time I am seeing a man pawn his wedding ring for a drink It's not that bad, Sir His entire family is here...yes... The doctor's name is Rosamma...if you could talk to her personally... That's all...ok...alright Thank you, Sir Look, there is Mariamma Chedathi Oh no...pretend you didn't see her Hey! How come you are all here? What happened? - We are here with Sleeva's girl - What? - She was not feeling well - Oh! Poor thing! - She is getting a drip now - Aren't you going to the Retreat today? - Of course! From last morning, I've had this burning feeling under my foot And I couldn't find the medicines anywhere! - (background) Yes, I've spoken to him - I need to buy the medicines afresh - Move a little. Let me sit - I don't know if he will get involved That's all I know - What happened to her exactly? - Well? - The doctor's been asking - She must have got a call by now - Could you please ask? - Please get the man here immediately The doctor's really angry. You don't know what she is like And you will have the Police to deal with too - What is going on here? - It's nothing, Chedathi - And where is Sleeva? - He'll be here soon Come on! Don't drink so much on an empty stomach! Eat this. What happened to you? What are you so tensed about? It's nothing When is the next bus to Pala? There is a direct one to Pala at 12.30 Why? Who is going? Sleeva...please eat this - I don't feel like it - It's good beef Don't let it go cold...eat! Why are you acting like a kid? Wow! There you are! Tucking away into your rice cakes and beef! Eldho...bro...he is here The new building...we will be right there! Ok...ok... What exactly did you do last night? We were looking all over for you! Where did you sleep? What are you talking about? What did Sleeva do? Hey! You...step outside! I...need to talk to Gopi Chetan What's going on, Gopi Chetan? What is the situation there? Last night, we had to take the girl to hospital Hospital? Was it so bad? She is alright now The doctor says she wants to see you. You will have to come Why does she want to see me? - Gopi Cheta...I am scared...I won't come.. please don't force me - Just come! She won't discharge the patient till she sees you That's why...you can eat first...go on... eat... Eat! (humming) You go inside...I'll park the car and join you...go... Come quick, Aliyan... Over there - Let's meet the doctor now - Ok, Mother Doctor...here he is... - Which one of you? - Oh God! Not me! It's him - He is the one Are you drunk? Look at her and answer, Sleeva Please stand outside, Mother...all of you stand outside Alright - What's your name? - Sleeva - How old are you? - Thirty five What century are you living in? Do you have even a bit of common sense? Does anyone do to their wife what you have done to yours? What did you think a physical relationship means? Some kind of menial labour? Look at me! Hello Is Rincy Chechi pregnant or....? Forget I asked I am going to report this. The Police will take care of you Section 376...rape....section 498... domestic violence You will be locked up for a minimum of 7 years Doctor...please don't make an issue of this - I'll do whatever... - What more will you do? There's nothing more to do Let me explain...at home... it's just my Mother and me - So? - Doctor...I mean... Stand outside...go...stand out! What did the Doctor say? She says she's going to report this If I understand correctly, that will be beyond us to handle I think you should go into hiding for a while There's no point looking at me If you had robbed a bank... ...I could've helped you...but this...I have no clue how to handle this You know...that doctor...is known to take bribes - Try giving her some money - Why don't you go and sit over there? - We'll figure out how to deal with this - Alright...alright... Father, this is a sure case for police intimation - It's a definite case of rape - Please doctor, don't scare us with all that - It was Aliyan's little mistake - Little mistake indeed! Getting a girl in that condition is what you call a little mistake? But...Sleeva is not a bad person at all All of this...is really unexpected I feel he has some mental issue He was so drunk when he came to see me that I could barely breathe! Doctor please...on my responsibility... for just this once... On your word, Father, I will let it go without reporting this time - But if the girl wants to report it, it should be done! - Doctor, I ... ...have spoken to her and she has no complaint - I also happen to be her Uncle - I suggest you get this boy some counselling He seems completely ignorant of marital and sexual relations Definitely...definitely... -Don't be upset, Mother...I will discharge the patient -Ok...ok... She may have some weakness...after all that struggle...that will pass... I have prescribed medicines...give them on time...what she needs most is rest... - Ok then - Thank you, doctor Who the hell is she? That doctor? - Doctor Rosamma.... - Rosamma? God! Oh...my...God! I am thinking of going away for a few days...I just can't...deal with this. Listen, bro...can I tell you something? If you don't go home tonight, how will your Mother explain it? Ever thought of what it's like at your house right now? I say you should go home now Whatever's happened...happened... It's gone slightly out of our control right now But there is no point in hiding in fear You should handle it bravely...that is where you show some courage There's nothing more to it - I don't know... - How much is two large pegs? Wait! No! There you are, my boy! You were hanging out here? We rushed to the hospital as soon as we heard But there was not a soul there! What really happened, my boy? I didn't really get what people were talking about You rogue! You knocked her unconscious, didn't you? How did it happen? Tell me everything! - Come on! Tell! - Sleeva...come on...we're leaving But...hey... Look, brother...when a friend is on the verge... ...of having his family destroyed, don't come up with these rotten talks! - You may not get the consideration of age everytime, ok? - Get lost, boy! - So that's that! - Too bad he left without saying anything! I wonder how it happened... - Hey! Drop me inside! - No, no! I am not coming in! You get going, bro - So I should just walk in? - Ya...of course! - Be brave, bro! - Alright...alright! OK...and by the way... ....please don't get up to any fresh nonsense! - Mom, Uncle Sleeva is home - Look at him! Like nothing's happened! This is what comes of hanging out with low-life boys! The entire family is humiliated! - What are we to do? - Stop it! That's enough! You go on spoiling him! The kids who came for the Retreat went back! You're not concerned about that one bit, are you? Come on, Tina! Come, son! It just...happened...Mother... I think that's enough repentance...now have your food and go to sleep! I am not hungry, Mother...I just want to have a bath... I swear on Mother Mary and Saint Eldhos... I won't go there again or touch her, ever! That should end all the trouble! Or...maybe... ...I should apologise Stop right there! Where do you think you are going? You dare step into that room and I will break your bones! Go and sleep in my room. Go! Go on! Go! What my son did was unforgiveable, I know I can imagine what you are feeling right now I have four daughters of my own On my son's behalf... ...I ask for your forgiveness You should sleep now It was nothing like people are saying Would I do that? Am I an idiot? I was a bit drunk, yes... - That part is true - But my dear lad... Who would set fire to their fields before harvest? - Did you put a lid on that curry? - You were the last to leave, Mom - Mother, where's the child? - Inside Did you talk to her? What could I say? I got her some coffee ...she did not drink it You go on inside Hold this...let me take a look - Have you had anything to eat? - Yes - Don't get up, child...you can lie down. Had anything to eat? - I don't want to eat Please don't be upset...I met Kuttayi on my way here I gave him a proper earful! He didn't dare say a word in reply If there is anyone he fears in this family, it is me! My child...I am going to attend the Retreat Lily will keep you company...tell her if you need anything - I'll see you later. Come. - Ok See you later Lily! Where are you, Lily? - What is it? - Get me that sickle that lost its handle I think I left it on that rock where we sat and talked yesterday - I forgot about it! - Go...run and get it for me Child....I'll be right back, ok? To think our Sleeva hasn't got an ounce of sense in him at this age! Is there anyone who doesn't know all this these days? Even little kids know all about it! You can't really blame Sleeva for this This is what is going on in many houses these days....just that no one faints... That's true, Shantha...these men only care about themselves I have three kids... - ...and I have no idea how they were born! - Don't let your husband hear you! - Look...don't start blaming him in front of his wife... - What did I say? - I just want to see this fixed - Well, I know you! Come on! Oh no! You haven't eaten anything? Mother...could you take me home? - I can't...Mother... - Please don't cry, my child Please don't go in this situation...it will break our hearts Just wait till after the Retreat...I will take you myself I will explain to your family what happened here... - Please don't cry... - If you are worried about him... ...I will personally ensure he is of no trouble to you again - Please come and eat something - Come Come, my child Kuttayi! Did you trouble that girl again? - No! - Then why is she crying in there? I truly don't know! I haven't been anywhere near her! - So what were you doing then? - I... - ...I was just around here... - Did you talk to her? You were the one who said you would break my bones if I went close to her Come down here. boy! Come on! Good Lord! Does my son not have as much sense as these animals? When I said don't go close to her, I meant you can't sleep in the same room I did not tell you not to talk to her! Did I? When are you ever going to learn all this? Why don't you just tell me what to do? I want you to act as the situation demands. How long can I guide you? It's only that girl who is going to be around in the last days of your life This is hardly something for us to teach you! Can't I get some peace around here? Mother! See how he walked off? - He thinks everything is trivial - For Heaven's sake, Anna, be quiet! Come...have your supper Food is served Sit closer, boy... You should have heard the Priest's sermon today It was about rebuilding families It was such a blessing! Please sit, Mother...I can serve... It's ok, child...I am fasting Will you serve yourself? I am going to bed Ok? What happened that day... ...don't think of it as a big deal, ok? If you can... ...could you please let it go? Did you....did you really marry me because you liked me? Have you ever had a decent conversation with me? Have you ever just sat with me for a bit? How...how could you think of doing this to me? Tell me! - Mother? - Yes? - I will go with you to the Retreat today That's good....you go get dressed Let's go together In that case, don't make her walk, Mother - You could ask Sleeva to drop you in the car - True Get dressed Do I need to come? Can I just send an auto for you? Just listen to what I say, ok? Alright Sit here, child - Please sit with me - I will Could you...move your hand a bit? I need to move the gears - You! Come with me! - I don't want to You should attend the Retreat See her going? Come! Let me park first In our society...in our homes... ...the animals we rear... ...birds...and then there is the horn bill that has a peculiarity... And that peculiarity is that... ...it maintains its family very securely... ...very happily...that is what we see... - ...about this bird...it mates... with its... - Hey! Sleeva! Got your eagerness under control? (Priest talking in the background) Hey you! Stop there! - Where are you off to? - I am leaving I can't stand there like a fool You made a mistake! Now stop feeling bad about it What happened to you is not unique You know Josekutty's niece? The silent one? Sony? - She got married and now she is home with a court case and all that. Know why? - Why? Because her husband was sexually abusing her! - I had no such thing in mind - That's not what I meant What I mean is no one heard about Josekutty's niece But they know about you...because they know you! That's why they talk about it! - Isn't that so, Father? - Come with me, Sleeva What do we do with this guy now? When you came and confessed before me that time, I had no idea you were so naive I am not blaming you...I did not take it that seriously This wouldn't have happened if you had had some timely counselling It's my fault...I apologise! After this Retreat, the Church is holding a family counselling session The Priest conducting it is famous for these sessions - Fr Aby Puthenpurackal I want you and Rincy to attend it Alright, Father You've been like brothers for so long! If you had talked to him some time about these things, this wouldn't have happened And now you are just laughing about it? I didn't know people had to be told about all this! No one ever talked to me about it! Did that hurt you in any way? Can't you be serious? See how the poor chap is hurting Don't get yourself all worked up, boy Don't make yourself sick! I am leaving now...please come soon You are a lucky man, Gopi Cheta - Do you ever fight? - Sometimes But we can't stay angry for long How do you manage that? That is... You can't really explain all that You need to experience it to know What I did was a terrible thing, wasn't it, Gopi Cheta? Of course it was! No doubts about that! At least you understand that now All you had to do was tell the girl that you did not really know That night...I was not in a state of mind to talk to her like that I... ...was really scared Never in my life have I... ...been so tense, you know? But why were you so scared? Are you the only person on earth to do this? Not everyone knows everything about everything You worry unnecessarily Just look around you...look at all the variety of creatures around Have you ever heard of any of them... ...attacking and subduing their mates for their own pleasure? Have you seen such a thing? That's true, isn't it? - They don't have any such issues, do they? - That's exactly what... ...we are like too. There is love inside each one of us You just need to bring that out In the vast skies... ...within my soul... ...you emerge, my love... ...like an Angel If I could only reveal... ...in just a line... ...what's on my mind... ...to you Unable to speak Unable to pour myself out My heart Aches... In the vast skies... ...within my soul... ...you appear, my love... ...like an Angel If I could only reveal... ...in just a line... ...what's on my mind... ...to you Unable to speak Unable to pour myself out My heart... ...aches Like a swan... ...seeking a lake... ...my eyes... ...seek you out Unfailingly... ...in my dreams... ...you alone appear And in loneliness... ...I hurt Why don't we bring Chechi here some time? Why don't we talk about things that are likely to happen? - First let her talk to me at least - Why don't you talk to her first, Sleeva? When we went that day...on our honeymoon... ...I lied about having a fever And still...up until dawn...she was sitting right by my side And I didn't even talk to her Now I long for an opportunity like that You know what your problem is, Sleeva? - What? - It's your shyness That was before Now I don't have all that...just wait and watch...when the Retreat is over... I'll take her and go...to the same resort we went last time It was such a beautiful place...atop a hill, it was just that resort - That's what I really wish - In the vast skies... ...within my soul... ....you appear, my love... ...like an Angel - 'If I could only reveal...' - Where did you go? - Hospital - Why? - She's pregnant - '...in just a line...' - '...what's on my mind...' - How are the vines? - '...to you...' - What's this? Shopping? - Ya, clothes Unable to speak Unable to pour myself out - '...my heart...' - What else did he say? - '...aches...' - He didn't say anything else Ammukutty...passion fruit! - Mom, I'll come soon - You go ahead...I'll bring her - Ok We were just talking about you Really? What did she say? I said you are really nice...and that you like her a lot And that you regret not talking to her on your honeymoon Why did you do that? Why did you have to tell her all that? - Anyway...what did she say? - Nothing in particular I have no idea No...I just came to know today We don't spend time together Once I tried to talk...but there wasn't much response from him I can't decide whether or not to talk to Uncle Eldhos Don't worry about all that...whatever you decide, I'll be with you I had my doubts on the very day he came home to meet you With his touch-me-nots and 'karimkurinjis'! I just didn't say anything Don't bother telling anyone at home...I haven't either It's your decision...and I will be with you I...am...on my shift right now... I'll call you later I was wondering...if you were bored... being alone... Could you please shut that door? - What did Suresh Gopi tell you...about me? - Don't lock it When we went on that honeymoon trip... you didn't really have a fever, did you? No...I... - ...wanted to tell you - It doesn't matter Are you still angry with me? I am not angry But we cannot...go further together I just can't...that is my issue of course Oh God! Why are you saying that? You didn't do anything...I was the one who created all the trouble Yes...that's what I was saying I can't spend my life with someone like you So...what...are you saying? Once the Retreat is over, take me home It's difficult for me to say this to Mother But there will be no change in my decision I... It was...my first time... ...being with a woman... ...being with a woman like that It turned out like...this... What I did was a wrong...that no man... ...should do to a woman Rincy... ...please forgive me! - This is the only way I know how to speak - '...my eyes seek you out...' Unfailingly In my dreams You alone appear And in loneliness... ...I am hurting In the vast skies... ...of my soul... - '...you appear to me, my love...' - Shall we put them together? -'... Like an angel from the Heavens...' - I think they're ready..but not yet... - 'If I could only reveal' - Let's just do it - '...in just one line...' - Ok, do it ...what's on my mind... ...to you Unable to speak Unable to pour myself out My heart... ...aches... See it laying eggs? Now the other will gather the eggs And there will be many babies - Then they will live together as a family - Is that so! - Who told you all these weighty things? - It was Sleeva, Grandma Sleeva! There's a fight going on inside the shop It's Betsy's Uncles...because it involves a girl, no one wants to interfere... - You don't understand with words, do you? - Babu! Stop it! Come on! Come...come...let's go... Hey! What's going on? What's the issue? There is no issue...and if there was, we have dealt with it - What? - Come on, brother What's going on? What happened? I have no idea what just happened! I was sitting here and playing my game as usual You tell him the rest! Betsy came to meet me, Sleeva... we were just talking And that's when her Uncles came in He's been at this for a while now! We've been seeing it all along Sleeva! You better get rid of him right away! - That's what's good for you too! - Don't threaten me! How dare you rough up these boys? - They didn't commit any grave crime! - You are the one encouraging them! I don't care if that's what you think! Now call your men and get out of here - Out! - Is he mad or something? - Out! Out! (crowd muttering) - Did they hurt you bad? - No... Do you have the guts to marry her? - Yes - Then go and get her out - I'll take care of the rest - Ok - Yes, Madhu Sir? - Hey! Sleeva! - Where are you? - Here in town - I have some good news Your 'Sakhyan' variety has been given a perfect score! - What? - That's right! I just got an email from the AEO - You have been selected! - Oh! - How long have you been in love? - It's been three years You know how it happened? One day she came to my shop to send... ...some fish pickle to her sister in Bangalore A week later, the parcel had not reached. She'd come every day to ask about it And then one day she asked for my number so she did not have to come in person The rest you can imagine...it went from calls... ...to long chats...and here we are now! And now ask him what happened to that pickle? Don't blame me for that! Here is the man responsible! That very night, we opened it... ...and had it for a side dish with our drinks! I think it's great to fall in love before getting married At least you get to understand each other - Yes... - What foolishness was this, boy? If you were in love, did you have to do it inside that shop? - That's why everyone came to know - But Chechi...we have done no wrong She left home saying she was going to the Retreat and came to meet me When they didn't see her in Church, her folks came over to my shop And that's how the issue started...it was not like...what you implied... We are just kids! How could you! Really, Chechi...I just wanted to meet him. That's why I went there - I still don't know why that is such a big sin - Yes...true... - There's nothing wrong with that, girl - But... ...what if they try to harm you for bringing these two here? What are you saying, Mother? It's not like old times...you cannot just split up people in love It's a free country! Gopi Cheta...we need to fix everything for their marriage registration tomorrow Thanks...Sleeva! - It's ok, Sleeva...I can sleep alone - I sleep here after that issue that night - So that issue is not solved yet? - No That issue is bigger than we thought... your girlfriend's asleep? How is it with you guys? It's going strong, right? - Have you told your folks? - That I did - My mother is a bit scared - What for? We are all here for you It's not really fear I also did not expect things to reach this far, this soon I am just worried they are going to beat me up again tomorrow My only consolation is having you for support... Sleeva! Will I have to suffer a beating again? Listen...don't start any trouble What do you mean? I am still hurt from the beating we got yesterday - I'll surely give him one today! - If there's any trouble, I am out! - Kuttychan...please come inside and sit! - I will give him one! - Oh Mother! Do you know how much debt we incurred for her studies? Send her out! I want to kill her! Kill her or raise her...it is upto you! But just let Kuttayi get home. You can speak to him For God's sake, Aliyan! Don't just stand and stare! Call him out! Or leave it to us...we will deal with it Stay calm, Baby, please! There is an event going on there How much does it cost to raise a pepper vine like this one? It is actually very economical. I use cowdung as manure, mostly And when we clear the overgrowth, we throw that in too You've heard how one rots to be fodder for another! That's true! And what are the things to keep in mind when planting? Well, if you don't know... ...the acidity of the soil... ...no amount of fertilisers will help You have to know the PH content...and... ...putting in some limestone from time to time... - ...will give best results - And you, Rincy... Sleeva's recognition is coming up in your honeymoon phase - How do you feel? - It is all his hard work and perseverance I am happy for him While there are many known varieities of pepper... ...the one that Sleeva has developed is gaining recognition It's fame is going to spread from the hills to across the seas - Let's wish him all the best! - Now all stand together and look here! Smile! Kuttychan! I was going to come over! How could you do this to me, Sleeva? My daughter is at your house and you did not think to tell me! I didn't expect this of you! We are here to take her home Mother...call the kids! - Come here, Kuttychan... - What for? - Please listen calmly to them... - Come on out here, you...! No, I won't come! I came away on my own accord! You swore to me last week that you have nothing to do with him! That's because you said you were going to consume poison Come on, Gracy! Just go and drag her here! Hey Babu! No threats here, ok? - If the kids come, you can take them - You are one to speak, Sleeva! - You are a man who raped his own wife! - Hey! Hey! You dare to slander our boy right here in our house? I'll break your bones! Just ignore him, sister! Come away, Chechi...come! Hey! You should go with them too! - You traitorous girl! I'll kill you! - Don't hit! Please don't hit her! Let's talk...come on...come inside and sit! Kuttychan...she is my is sister too! Do you think I would get involved with something that was bad for her? Do you think so? Is that what you think of me? Look...there are so many loans...education loan..pawned gold...other loans... Do you know the pains we've been taking to educate our girls? And just when we thought our troubles were almost over... ...she does this! Oh Lord! My child's future has been ruined! Kuttychan...for a man and woman to understand each other... ...is the best life one hope for...and these two have that I know it personally And...he is my friend - I will be his gruarantor! Ok? - Chechi...let me... - I'll serve it - Ok Kuttychan! Please take a cup of tea! Come on! Just have the tea! Come on...take a cup! Go on! Come on, Gracy! Take it! Could you give tea to those outside too? I understand what you are saying If they want to, let them be together. We don't have any objection What do we do about her loans? It still needs to be paid off She is not the only child I have...there is a younger one too Don't worry about the loans... We'll pay it off ourselves... won't we, Betsy? Do whatever the hell you want. You are nothing to us anymore Before our parish and the neighbours... ...your father and mother are humiliated...but... ...be happy, my children... Daughter... Will you get him something to eat? - Have you eaten? - No...I will, later... I was thinking What you said is true Let's not...take a risk with our lives Everyone has their own freedom, I guess Just tell me when...and I will take you home And...about Mother... - ...let her not know about this for now - Ok...alright... Mother...it doesn't look like this rain is going to stop soon Today is the last day anyhow...let me drop you Honey...get dressed...he said he would drop us Today is the final day of this Retreat This has been a blessing from God...let us glorify His name... - Can you say together : Hallelejah! - Hallelujah! And dear ones., I have another happy news... ...I need to share with you today Our beloved Sleeva is here today...Sleeva, stand up There is no need to introduce him here For the past few days, through the media... ...we have been seeing him and hearing about the recognition he has won A variety of pepper... ...that he developed by himself... ...has been recognised by the National Agriculture Research Institute... ...and it has won recognition at the national level Dear ones, this is an honour for our entire village And our dear Sleeva is a role model for everyone... ...is what I would like to say.

Oh dear...we started looking for a girl for him as soon as he was of age There were many proposals He wouldn't go and meet any of them For him, the only girls in his life were his sisters... ...and me! The first time he met a girl... ...and liked her... ...was with you Hey you ...go to sleep now We have only one life, my child...and we have to look out for our own life Is there anyone without fault?

I will be praying for you Alright, Mother Please don't go away, Chechi...don't leave Mother alone See you later What are you thinking, Rincy? Nothing... Can I tell you something? - It's not a pleasant matter - What is it? I am coming to drop you home, right? And you need to tell your family what happened That is the right thing to do But...to cause our family members so much pain... ...because of our actions... ...it doesn't feel...nice... I was thinking... ...maybe after I leave... - ...then you could tell them - What? You can say I am a fraud...and you can't...put up with me Just make me a really bad guy If I try to explain... ...then they will start questioning us both... ...and it will become a really nasty scene Do you understand what I am saying? - How was the drive? - There were so many traffic blocks! - It's like we were stewing in the car! - It's because of the festival - Come in! - Come. And how are you, Rincy? - I am good! We got the news, by the way About your award...it was on the news Oh! That...yes! Won't you meet my mother? Of course! I will! - OK, Ok - Listen!

What can I give in return? My heart wonders...wonders... For you to know yourself... ...for me to know what you know I shall be a fragment of looking glass Hiding in your eyes To tell you stories untold I shall whisper in your ears And for a smile to bloom on your lips I shall be the honey on them Old habits give way As the day comes closer What shall I give in return? My heart wonders For you to know yourself... ...for me to know what you know I shall be a fragment of looking glass Hiding in your eyes To tell you stories untold I shall whisper in your ears For a smile to bloom on your lips I shall be the honey on them The days and nights with you Are casting their glow all over my mind On your jewelled cheeks A golden star rises I wish I could slowly rise there too Wanderers... ...two birds on wing... ...that's who we are Let's fly on for miles Soar slowly into the distance Far, far away
