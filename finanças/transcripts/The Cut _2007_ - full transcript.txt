We'll need quite a bit. We'll get more. I'll ask Mr. Kim. (Cadaver) Hi, long time no see. Give me back my bag. Hey, I'm just trying to help. Let's go. I want to check out the women's dormitory. Seon-hwa! The rooftop? Seriously? Then where else? Meat tastes the best at barbecue restaurants. We can't even eat half of what we would eat at restaurants. You're at it again. Enough, okay? - Let's drink. - All right. Cheers. Anyway, we're a team now. Let's all get along. Then are we going to start dissecting them tomorrow? What are you talking about? First, we'll give them a massage and pluck their hair. Then we'll peel the skin off. Now that's pleasant. - Is it? - Guys. We should stay focused. In a way, the cadaver is like our first patient. - Amen, pastor. - Our first patient? Then how much should we charge? - Eun-ju. - What? We're investing a lot in this. Exactly. There's no need to act so high and mighty. Right, Dr. Min? Dr. Song? What do you mean? What? Guys. The meat is burning. - Let's drink. - Yes, let's drink. Here's to our ridiculously expensive education! Cheers to all the poor medical students! Here's to hoping our first cadaver to be a sexy, voluptuous lady! - Cheers! - Cheers! Guys. Do you want to hear a shocking story? What is it? I overheard my father's conversation with the dean. I'm not exactly sure what caused the accident. It could have been a wild animal. The driver could have been scared transporting them, or maybe he was in a rush and missed an exit or something. Or perhaps, there was some kind of grudge involved. Darn it. What was that? Goodness. When the police arrived at the scene, the driver was already gone. The trailer door was left open, and the cadavers were all over the place. What do you think happened on that pitch-black mountain road in the middle of the night? Darn it, you scared me. - Here, take this chair. - Sorry. I'm a little late. Now that everyone is here, should we decide who will go first? Do you want to go first? Or ladies first? Why not go in the order of our GPA? Sounds good. That's simple. Come on. Do we really have to worry about our grades already? Or how about we compare our scholarship amounts? Including the Working Scholarship. Let's do it. But you know what? If it's a male cadaver, someone might be all over him. - What? - Hey, ladies. That's enough. I knew this would happen, so I came prepared. Gather around. The one who picks the largest number will go first. Here, pick one. (Sincere gratitude to the donors) Apparently, he is heartless and ruthless, hence the nickname "The Technician." That is just a rumor. He's actually warmhearted. Do you know him personally? He is my uncle's friend. We are here to honor the souls of those who gladly donated their bodies - to medical science. - Ji-yeong. Last time, you said... This is to remind you of - the dignity of human life. - See you in the art room, okay? For the sake of modern medicine... It's not like this will appease their souls. Why not? The corpses that we will work with during this semester aren't mere training materials. In other words, we'll be cutting them open - without their consent. - Without trusting that we would treat them with the respect they deserve, this donation would not have been possible. Please remember that during your training. We will observe a moment of silence now. So this is why it sounded as if someone was crying here every night. What's with the look on your faces? Go ahead and remove the cover. Jeez, my eyes sting. It is drenched in formaldehyde. It looks like this woman died during surgery. She has a killer body. I bet she was a party animal. Who gets a tattoo like this these days? What are you doing? She will be reduced to bones once we are done. I should take some photos to remember this. Would you be happy if someone undressed you and took photos? Me? Yes, I would like that. What a psycho. What are you doing? Are you fondling her? Wipe her down thoroughly. What is it? What happened? I asked you what happened! I'm sorry. I was mistaken for a moment. "Mistaken"? Do you think you are still in pre-med? You did take comparative anatomy classes there, right? Then let me ask you a question. What do the lower vertebrates share in common? The lower vertebrates have more teeth... Other than their teeth. Anyone else? Most mammalian red blood cells are about eight micrometers in diameter, but they are well above ten micrometers for lower vertebrates. Then do you know what doctors of lower caliber have more of? Fear, guilt, and useless emotions. To put it more accurately, such things determine who is cut out to be a doctor and who isn't. The latter should not be in this room. What is it? Is something wrong? (Death Certificate Yoon Hyeong-sin) (Death Certificate Jung Yu-mi) Did you have another nightmare? You're still up? I had a nightmare too. You too? I am so screwed. On top of this nightmare, I screamed in the lab because I was seeing things. I know. You startled me. I was surprised to see our top student being so nervous. I used to fight even harder at times like this. Is it because you still have feelings for Chan-yong? What about you? I think Gi-beom is pretty decent. He is different from the other guys. But he could just be pretending. Maybe he is acting naive to set himself apart from the others. So? Will you be single for the rest of your life? Why not? I have been single all my life anyway. I envy that confidence of yours. So? How was it? Sorry? The dissection. Right. I have always waited for the moment when I would finally pick up a scalpel. But now that the moment is here, I'm not sure. It certainly isn't an easy job. I bet you are still all over the place. How was it for you, Uncle? Did students get scared during your time too? Of course. But there were some who didn't even bat an eye. There was one who practically lived in the lab. Are you talking about Uncle Ji-u? You won't find a better teacher. He was a stellar student. I see. But my classmates are scared of him. Why did you hang it up there? Get rid of it. Get rid of your clothes first. Hey. No one is coming, right? Come here. - What are you doing? - Having some fun. - What are you doing? - Hold on. We were told to assemble in the art room. - Why? - I'm not sure. Do not pull a prank like this again. If this happens again... I will fail all of you. What happened? You are the worst troublemakers I have seen in the past three years. Tidy up. I see someone prepared a surprise gift for me. Who was it that did something so childish? They say that when your insecurities run deep, they can turn you into a psychopath. Ji-yeong, Chan-yong. I'm really curious. What were you two doing here? What were you doing that you didn't know a cadaver was staring at you? Hey, shut it. - What are you doing? - Having some fun. - What are you doing? - Hold on. Psychopaths don't get how much harm they are inflicting on others. This would be a great reference for your psychiatric evaluation. Hey! What are you doing? You are such a pervert. The liver receives 25 percent of cardiac output from the portal vein and the hepatic artery... Cutaneous nerves are easily damaged. Not all nerves are the same. They are all different. How can you be here and not know that? There she goes again. You have to use a scalpel for this. Be mindful of the direction. It has to be done with a scalpel. - Hey. - What? Do I have something on my face? You really are something else. Do you really want to eat that now? Hey, do you know why the carps in this pond are so huge? Remember Ho-cheol? The guy who dropped out after failing six times. Do you remember him or not? I think it was during his fifth time as a first year. He just couldn't take it during cadaver dissection. He wanted to do some extracurricular studying, so he cut an arm off a cadaver to take home. Then he ran into his TA, who was hanging out with a girl here. Guess what he did. He threw the arm into the pond right away. Hey, Gyeong-min. Don't hang out with him. Why can't you be nicer? That punk lies all the time. I need to lose some weight. You two make a great couple! Wait up, Gyeong-min. Sternal, renal, dorsal, distal... - Synovial... - Subclavian... The hamstrings. - Complex... - The scapula... - There are 65... - Skeletal... - Cranial... - Pivot joint... - Posterior... - Cranial... - Distal... - Again. - Most of them... - Dorsal regions... - Cranial... - Dorsal... You will wake the patient. Move it. - Hey! - Hey. The exam is over. What are you doing? Let's go grab a drink. Why the long face? Did you bomb the exam? I don't know. - Lucky you. - What about me? Your father is a renowned cardiologist and the chairman of a hospital. You won't ever have to worry about money or finding a job. On top of that, you are smart and get good grades. Look at me. Shut it, idiot. Did the fat from the cadaver mess you up? Gi-beom, let's go grab a drink. It has been too long. Have you guys seen Seon-hwa? Stop being such a wuss! Bang her already. Right? What a loser. Yes. Chuck this damn thing out. Your student ID is all you need. Let's go to an Atlantis of our own! The moment the exam began, my mind went blank. Like a blank piece of paper, I couldn't remember a thing. It's okay. Just do better next time. "Next time"? Next year, after I fail the course? Come on, Eun-ju. You are being dramatic. You think I'm being dramatic? Seon-hwa, I don't want to be one of those obnoxious bookworms. But I couldn't even look straight at the cadaver. I bet everyone laughed. - Eun-ju. - Yes, it sure is nice to see Kang Eun-ju wallowing in despair. Despair is a natural human emotion. In any case, I envy you. What about me? I saw you holding the cadaver's hand on the first day. To tell you the truth, I'm quite used to handling corpses. My father wasn't a mortician, but he always helped prepare the bodies for funerals when our neighbors passed away. And I assisted him from a young age. Really? Wasn't it scary? No, not at all. He always talked to the bodies while preparing them for their funerals. And it was fun to listen to him talk to them. It made me crack up here and there. At times, I thought they might not even be dead. Everything depends on your attitude. It's all in your mind. Goodness. Are you a Buddhist monk now? Eun-ju, don't overthink. They are human too, just like us. Come on. I could do it when I was a little boy. Yes. Let's get a good night's sleep and practice in the lab for a few days. To be honest, I'm a little worried too. Let's study for the re-exam together. It is nice that we can do it together. I don't even know anymore. Eun-ju, does this mean you are back to being a bookworm again? That's right. But let me get some sleep first. (Sorry about earlier, Seon-hwa.) (Thanks for trying, ) (but I should overcome this on my own.) (Don't worry about me. I'm off to the lab.) No, I'm not skipping my meals. I'm worried about you, Mom. You said your knee hurt. Is it okay now? It's not covered by insurance? Anyway, Mom. I'm going to make a lot of money in the future, so stop refusing to see a doctor because you want to save money. No, I can't this week. I will visit you next week. All right. Please help me. I have to become a doctor. My mom and my sister... They are all struggling because of me. So... I have no choice but to cut you up with a scalpel. Can you please understand? I'm sorry. - Why are you so excited? - What? Because of you. Is anybody there? Is anybody out there? Your call cannot be connected. Please leave a message after the tone. Extra charges may apply. Seon-hwa, it's me. I'm in the lab right now. But the doors are locked. Come and get me out, Seon-hwa. I'm locked in here. Seon-hwa... Please, Seon-hwa... (Anatomical Laboratory) (Do Not Enter) What happened? - This is insane. - What happened? Gosh, I can't believe this. Who was the first to find her? Everything found at the scene belongs to the students. Only the fingerprints of the dead student were found on the knife. She couldn't have possibly cut her own stomach open. There is one more thing. Her heart was missing. Her heart? "Despite the meticulous suturing," "the knife wound was rough." "Possibility of a heart transplant can't be presumed." Gosh, this is such an absurd case. What is your take on this? Stop reading those reports. - Sorry? - And it's a scalpel, not a knife. It is all my fault. What do you mean? Had I truly sympathized with how Eun-ju was feeling, she wouldn't have gone to the lab by herself. (School of Medicine) What are you doing? What do you mean? What is your problem? So it could have been done by an insider? - I think it was her. - What's gotten into you? It wasn't me. I swear. I heard the lab door was locked. It wasn't me! At that time, I was... I have an alibi. Besides, I'm not a doctor yet. I can't suture like that. Gosh, she's so fake. I don't want to work with scalpels even when I become a doctor! Do you really think I'll spend the rest of my life staring at rotting bodies? Seon-hwa. You must take care of yourself first, no matter what happens. I trust that you'll stay strong and get over this as you have done in the past. Do you know what my nickname was back in school? "Osteological Specimen." My classmates touched my bones to study for the exams. Right. You are in this picture too. Sorry? Right here. I see. My mom worked with you as a nurse. That's right. But she quit for the sake of the adorable baby in her womb. Uncle Ji-u. Can I have this picture? (Seonjae School of Medicine Student Council) Was she a close friend? Yes. Her family doesn't seem to be well-off. Stay until the end of the funeral and help them out. Here. You're okay, right? Don't worry about me. You should visit home more often. A family dinner is long overdue. Okay. Father. Is everything all right with you? Why? You never used to smoke. Director. Can we talk for a moment? Can we talk tomorrow at the hospital? You know how my wife is. She can't sleep alone at night. I was just starting to get used to it. Hey, shouldn't we hold a shamanic ritual or something? You idiot. A shamanic ritual? Did you go to see a fortune-teller again? Stop being so superstitious, you punk. It's not a superstition. I... started having the same dream that I had after our first cadaver dissection. A cadaver coming alive and moving is one thing, but now, a one-eyed doctor started appearing in them, and... What is it? Have I told you about my dream before? - What is it? - I had the exact same dream too. What? So everyone on the team had the same dream? Damn it. I'm getting goosebumps. I'm sorry, Eun-ju. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Calm down, Ji-yeong. You know it wasn't your fault. What is it? Will you be all right alone? Why? - Seon-hwa, I just... - What do you want? Sorry, I'll leave you alone. Seon-hwa. It's me. I'm in the lab right now. But the doors are locked. Come and get me out, Seon-hwa. I'm locked in here. Please, Seon-hwa... What is this? Say something. What is this? Who was that? What is this? Who was that? What was that? Who was it? What was that? Who was it? Get a grip! Gyeong-min, look at me. Look me in the eye! Seon-hwa. How's Gyeong-min? He has calmed down. He said he wants to be alone. Will he be all right? I don't know. I'm not sure how you guys will take this, but... What is it? Do you think Eun-ju was killed by a human being? What? Then what else could it be? A ghost? A cadaver? - Have you lost your mind? - Think about it. We all had the same dream. I'm sure it was just a coincidence! So a cadaver appeared in our dreams by coincidence. What about the one-eyed doctor? Stop bringing up that damned dream! No. I also saw what Ji-yeong saw at the funeral. The reflection in Eun-ju's funeral portrait. - The one-eyed doctor. - Gi-beom. Eun-ju... Our close friend died. How could you talk such nonsense in this situation? Seon-hwa, I'm not talking nonsense, I... You don't deserve to be her friend. Get out. - Seon-hwa. - Get out! I am sick of you. Fine. I'll leave if you want me to. But watch what you say. Who are you to tell me I'm not her friend? You weren't her only friend. Are you the only one devastated by her death? If the things I did until now stressed you out that much, I sincerely apologize. However, I always meant everything I said. Have you ever tried to understand anyone else's sincere feelings? Chan-yong. Chan-yong! Were you really... the one who locked that door? Why did you do that? Because of you. I did it because of you. What? Did you actually hope Eun-ju would die? Yes, I did. You really give me the creeps. Don't ever call me again. I just wanted you to forget her! Pick up. - Chan-yong. - Ji-yeong. I did some thinking and realized it was partially my fault too. It's me. Where are you? I told you not to call me. What? You told me to come to the art room. Ji-yeong. What's wrong? Ji-yeong. Ji-yeong! Ji-yeong. It's me, Gyeong-min. Ji-yeong! (Gyeong-min) Hello? I'm in the lab right now. But the door is locked. Gyeong-min! Hey, what happened? What's wrong? Gyeong-min. Tell me what you saw! You said you saw everything. Hey. You must know who killed her! We will all die. The door wouldn't open. We are all going to die. She was lured into the lab. Ji-yeong wanted to get out. - What is the matter with you? - Let go! Come on out. Let's go. Gyeong-min, stop! Hey, come on. Hurry. We have to go. If you leave like this, will you give up on becoming a doctor? Doctor? What doctor? A doctor who kills? That's right. You are just like them. It's all your fault, you punk! - You spoiled prick. - What? You desecrated that woman's body. She is trying to get her revenge! - Gyeong-min! - This is an announcement. Everyone must evacuate the laboratory building at once as per the police's request. Please understand and cooperate - with their investigation. - Wait up! - Please note that... - Hurry up! Classes will resume in Building B as per the normal schedule. My fellow students of Seonjae, your cooperation in this matter is highly appreciated. Keep your pride and dignity as intellectuals. Stay calm - and act reasonably. - You jerk! This is Im Sang-yun, the student council president. You piece of trash. It was your fault that Eun-ju and Ji-yeong became enemies! You scumbag! We have to go. How could you run away alone? You're right! That is why I couldn't stand being here! They both died because of you! What are you guys doing? Gyeong-min, what's wrong? Gyeong-min, snap out of it. It's me. Gyeong-min! - What's going on? - Are you okay? Hey, we must hurry. Look here. Hey, it's okay. - Slowly. - It's okay, Gyeong-min. Breathe slowly. Slowly. - Gyeong-min. - Gyeong-min. - Gyeong-min, what's wrong? - Snap out of it! - Ko Gyeong-min. - Snap out of it! Come on. We have to go. - Hurry. - Let's go. Thoracotomy. It wasn't just ripped out of the chest. There was a proper surgical procedure. Whoever did this cleanly cut through the sternum and pectoral muscles. Even the suturing is at the exact same skill level as the last time. Do you have any idea who could have done this? Do you think it's my fault like Gyeong-min said? Because I treated the cadaver with disrespect? Was that why the girls died and Gyeong-min lost his mind? Gi-beom. You were going to tell me something that day. Let's hear it. (Truck driver found dead days after going missing) Gi-beom. You said it was all in our minds. The mind moves the body. The mind is affected by the waves of energy around us. If your brainwaves come into contact with a certain kind of wavelength while you're weak physically and mentally, horrible things can happen. "Horrible things"? I have seen people like that. They harm themselves or attack others for no reason. But they don't remember what they did. They all say someone strangled them. The police only found Eun-ju's prints on the scalpel. Are you saying someone's soul possessed her and made her harm herself because she was feeling mentally weak? I'm not sure. In any case, regardless of who the culprit is, we might end up finding ourselves alone in the lab one day, just like Eun-ju and Ji-yeong. Hey! Are you looking at me right now? - I saw you three times. - Ms. Kim. I walked out of my grave! - Calm down. - Darn it, you pricks. You jerks, I'll teach you a lesson! - Let go of me! - We should still look into it. We can't just sit back and do nothing. Professor Han. Don't you have any regrets? You are asking me the question? I told you a while back. Truth only holds you back, but belief propels you forward. And someone is threatening your belief. Two students have died already and imitated Yun-ho's suturing technique. I must say, it's nothing compared to what you did to me in the past. What are you getting at? You'll see in due time what I mean. I knew it. The heart is gone. Who did this and why? Organ trafficking, perhaps? Hold her arm up. What are you doing here? So you think the soul of the woman who lost her heart killed both students? We can't prove it, but we know there's something off about that cadaver. It's not even on the cadaver list. And that woman has the exact same wound - as our friends... - Name, Seo Yu-gyeong. Age, 26. She agreed to organ donation before she died. She was sent here as a cadaver as per her last wishes with her family's consent. Suspecting that the cadavers might have something to do with the case, I submitted the original document to the police. That is why you couldn't find it. I understand why you are anxious. But you're students of medicine. Don't talk such absurd nonsense and ruin the school's reputation. But we have all had the same nightmare, Professor. Just as the ill seek treatment, the soul who appeared in our dreams... That's why you're a necrophiliac. Sorry? When you were in high school, you went to see a psychiatrist because you had a carnal attraction to corpses. I heard you exhibited necrophiliac tendencies. That's... The police are investigating the case, so just focus on your studies. You may leave. Seon-hwa. Don't get the wrong idea. I told you. I got used to it while watching my father handle the bodies. My mom hated it though. So she forced me to see a psychiatrist. Gi-beom. It feels as if I... don't know you at all. We might end up finding ourselves alone in the lab one day. Seon-hwa. Seon-hwa, snap out of it. Are you all right? Gi-beom, you are strong. I am heavier than I look. I have been working out for this day. - But Gi-beom. - Yes? Being crazy is similar to being possessed, right? I told you I'm not crazy. Did you have a lot to drink? I'm totally sober right now. Gi-beom. Yes? I have never told anyone this before. My dad is like that too. What do you mean? My dad is in a mental hospital. Is he? But he used to be such a great dad. He was a sweet man. Just like you, Gi-beom. What? Didn't you say you were sick of me? But his condition is quite serious. Do you know why? Because he... killed my mom. I, too, almost died at his hands. My amazing dad still doesn't know what he did. So I... To this day, I still have nightmares where my dad chokes me. When Eun-ju and Ji-yeong died, it felt as if my dad was the one who did it. I'm terrified. I'm... Don't worry, Seon-hwa. Nothing will happen to you. I promise. I'll make sure that no one dares to touch you. You trust me, right? Gi-beom. Yes? Put me down. I'm getting sleepy. Gi-beom. Did you not get any sleep? Did you sleep well? Do you know who he is? We should look for him first. Although I don't think he's alive. Seon-hwa, what was the order we decided on again? This is the last address on record? Where is this? You already know. How would I know where this is? It's the red-light district. What? Hey, print this out for me. Hey, Gi-beom. I'm with Hyeong-jin now. Hey, listen up. The Technician, that jerk... He lied to us. Seo Yu-gyeong? Nonsense. Her name is Jung Yu-mi. Do you know what's even more messed up? This woman died 20 years ago. (Identification Document Name: Jung Yu-mi) Twenty years ago, she was admitted to the university hospital. How do you still remember her? Seon-hwa, where did you get this photo? She was our team's cadaver. What? A cadaver? Then do you happen to know this man? Seo Yun-ho. He was an incredibly talented doctor. However, he didn't get the recognition he deserved because of people's prejudices against him. (Grade 2 Hearing Impairment) Maybe that's why he felt sorry for this woman who couldn't speak. He told me several times that he wanted to take off with her. So I thought they left together. That woman, Yu-mi. She probably couldn't even express her emotions, right? "I had a scary dream last night." "My heart aches." "I want to get out of here." "I need help." What if The Technician was the one who removed her heart? That jerk creeps me out. I don't know what it is about, but he has been threatening my father. Uncle Ji-u? Let's search his office. There is nothing here. Why are the spirits after us? We have nothing to do with them. They are resentful, and we cut them open for no reason. Did you open it? These are hearts. What in the world did he do in here? Artificial hearts... There are all sorts of things here. What is this? She was in here? That jerk. He handed her over to us as a cadaver to get rid of the body. "The health and well-being of my patient is my first consideration." "I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity." "I will not use my knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties even under threat." Seon-hwa, are you all right? That's right. This concerns us too. We may end up becoming heartless doctors just like him. Seon-hwa, how about we try to retrace her steps? Would someone remember a woman who lived here 20 years ago? Let's try to find someone. Our lives are at stake. Are you all right? I can't die yet. (Wild Rose) Excuse me. This woman lived in this neighborhood 20 years ago. Do you know of anyone who might remember her? Here. Why? Do I look that old? Gosh, you have got to be kidding me. By the way, what happened 20 years ago? Hey, young miss. May I help you? It's nothing. You are not bad looking. But you need to wear some makeup. What do you think you are doing? You little... Gi-beom! Hey. Seon-hwa! - Seon-hwa! - Seon-hwa! Min Seon-hwa! Seon-hwa! You brat! Are you going to pay the water bill? Go bring more customers, you good-for-nothing! Seon-hwa! Seon-hwa! Anyone in this alley could be her father. No one knows who her father is. This place was her whole world. She ate what she was given and took in customers when she was told to. One day, she fought back against a drunk customer and was stabbed. Hello? It's me, Gi-beom. Seon-hwa had to go somewhere. Yes. Sorry? How... Okay. What is it? - Gyeong-min is gone. - What? Seon-hwa's father had a seizure, so everyone on duty rushed to his room. He must have escaped then. Damn it. Seon-hwa is still in danger. Where in the world did she go? A penny for your thoughts? Gosh, you made it. What is it? Is there good news? I'm just excited to see a good friend of mine. We used to be close. The two of us and Yun-ho. Let's drink. It's been too long. She was always quiet and couldn't even speak. I don't know what got into her that day. She was covered in blood, but she flew into a rage and went bonkers. In the end, the thugs got sick of her, so they abandoned her in front of the hospital. (Hospital Entrance) That's how... Stubborn idiot. She got her first taste of the outside world. - Help her up. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Ma'am! - She has lost loads of blood. - Get a bed ready in the ICU. - Okay. I know. You must have thought this over. But give it one more minute. Everyone at the hospital... is going through a lot! Calm down! Those of us who work at this hospital can't let you die. - Doctor Seo. - Are you okay? Based on what we heard, it must have been better for her there. After all, it's a place where doctors treat the ill. Was someone else here? Yes, the director. I figured you'd be late, so I had a drink with him. But he left at 11 p.m. sharp. He said he wanted to spend some time with his wife tonight. Is that so? It's already been over 20 years since you and the director had the world in an uproar by announcing that you would be developing an artificial heart. Goodness. Why bring that up out of the blue? Why? Do you regret it? No, not at all. It was the most meaningful moment I had as a doctor. You really are amazing. You managed to go so far as to kill someone to defend your belief. What are you trying to say right now? The director told me that he finally feels awake thanks to a terrible nightmare. "A nightmare"? Did you say "nightmare"? This isn't a dream. It's real. We can't deny that we made exaggerations to make it all seem real. You acted as if you would give me all the support I needed. How deceitful. They teamed up with engineers and already produced visible results. We live in a small country. Of course, it would stir up government officials. We don't have much time left, do we? Bone saw. What are you doing? Give it back! - I won't. - Hand it over. - Hand it over! - No! Hand it over! Have you all lost your minds? - Yu-mi. - Mind your own business! Bone saw. Bring it over. What is wrong? What is it? What's the matter? What? So? Was the surgery successful? Thanks to that surgery, we discovered a critical flaw. Right. It was an experiment, not surgery. Over 1,000 heart disease patients gained new lives. Isn't that a big accomplishment for a prostitute who tried to take her own life? One day... Yun-ho showed me his shriveled leg and told me this. "I can accept the illnesses God gave me as my fate, but the ones that were caused by people are the most painful and hard to treat." I have been trying to right such wrongs. I know that they're already dead, but it is my duty to tend to their suffering. This concerns your younger sister too. She is already dead. If Seon-hwa finds out the truth, she will be even more devastated. But I cannot let them get killed for no reason because of what you people did. I am not talking about the surgery. Seon-hwa... Who do you think she takes after that she is so smart and shrewd? Yes, don't worry too much. All right. Gyeong-min didn't go home. What is going on? What is he up to? Gyeong-min is a gentle soul! You know that! You know this has nothing to do with that. Didn't you notice anything else while staying with him? No, not at all. Not until he had that seizure. But why did that happen? What? We managed to calm him down, but his seizure got worse. Perhaps it was Professor Han who triggered it. That's it. Think about the victims' bodies. That suturing technique. You can see why everyone calls him "The Technician." He was also the first person to encounter that woman's spirit, which had been released for the first time in 20 years. (Artificial heart no longer a dream) (Seonjae School of Medicine Artificial Heart Center) Together, we made history. Didn't we? You... I worked more diligently than anyone else, right? Professor Han. A belief is just a tool used to support the truth. So... is that why you ditched me and joined hands with those engineers? For the truth? Is that what this is about? What we did was beyond horrendous. I don't know. Do you think you would be able to free yourself from guilt by telling the world what actually happened? If you still have any conscience left in you, you should pray that you'll suffer the same fate as the students. All right. Let's finish Han Ji-u off once and for all. But I'm not sure yet. What are you saying? Let's go to the lab. Would Seon-hwa be there? Of course. Gyeong-min might show up too. Damn it. What was the order again? It happened in the dormitory last time. Jung-seok. You look like a cadaver right now. So do you, punk. Are you ready for this? Yes, let's split up here. I will go to the dormitory this time. Seon-hwa! Seon-hwa, are you all right? Min Seon-hwa! You... It's me, Gi-beom. It's okay, Seon-hwa. You are okay now. Do you... trust me? I do. I trust you. So pull yourself together, okay? Seon-hwa. Seon-hwa, open your eyes. Seon-hwa. Min Seon-hwa! Wake up, Seon-hwa. Please. Seon-hwa, no. Open your eyes, Seon-hwa. Wake up! Seon-hwa. Seon-hwa. Please, open your eyes. Wake up. Seon-hwa! It's over. It's all over now. It's over now. No, please... It wasn't me. (Video 003_1) Ji-yeong wanted to get out of there! Vagus. Soleus! Ji-yeong... was there all alone. Deltoid. Plantaris tendon. You are alone too, right? Lumbricals, subclavius, hypercapnia! No. No... It can't be. I know exactly who you are with. Ventricles. Thoracotomy! We will all die. Right? All five of us! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Thoracotomy... It was you. (The Barber and The Rose) You killed her! No... Father... (Surgery record) (Surgeon: Han Ji-u 1st Assistant: Park Sang-heon) Seon-hwa. Seon-hwa, please... But they don't remember what they did. They all say someone strangled them. I still have nightmares where my dad chokes me. My father would never do such a thing. My father is a true doctor. Gyeong-min, my father... My father... "Date and time." "Sunday, October 27, 1985." "17:00." "Surgery details." "LVAD implant and anticoagulant therapy" "to prevent blood clots." Seon-hwa. "Patient name." "Jung Yu-mi." "Doctor in charge." "Han Ji-u, Park Sang-heon." I know. Trust me. It's been very hard for me too. It had been weighing on my heart. It was lonely and painful. Back then, no one knew things would turn out that way. But Seon-hwa, it's all over now. You will overcome everything. Yes, absolutely. You think so too, right? You will be okay. Nothing will happen to you. So, please... Hand that over to me. Seon-hwa, you... You don't know who I really am, right? - I'm... - There are two things you don't know. One. A doctor is someone who tends to the ill. Two. I have come this far because I'm your daughter. Seon-hwa. I should have never been born. I don't need... a father. Why are you so nice to me? Because it makes me feel good. It makes me happy. I'm grateful for your kindness, but I will only make your life difficult. The thought of me doing that to someone I should be grateful to terrifies me. Happiness is difficult. Happiness has no purpose. Happiness gives you joy, but it's hard to achieve. When I'm with you, I feel happy. I... I don't deserve to be happy. Look at me. My leg. Last night, I had a terrible nightmare. My heart... aches. I need... your... help. Gi-beom. I'm sorry I couldn't open up to you and reciprocate your feelings all this time. I guess I didn't realize how I felt about you. But... But I have waited for the moment when I would finally pick up the scalpel.
