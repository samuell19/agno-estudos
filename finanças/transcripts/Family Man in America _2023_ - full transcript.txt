No definitely, all those applications we can develop. Yes, I have done all those things and always in operations. No, I don't have green card. I understand. Thank you. (sounds from TV) Babe. Hmm? There's no food in the kitchen. What do you want me to do about it? Of course, I'm hungry.

What's happening? It's almost three months. You're not able to get a job? I'm trying, sir. It's, I have a lot of interviews I have gave. I have also lined up some more interviews. Or if you're not able to get a job in... I am sir. Definitely I can't help you, okay? Yes sir. Hello sir. Hi. Yes Arjun, uh, myself. Oh, thank you sir. I saw this opportunity and indeed I just had to go for it. So, uh, thank you for your opportunity. No, sir. I am grateful that you gave me the opportunity for the interview today. And... I'm here. I'm okay for operations too as well, sir. It's all part of the software lifecycle, so, you know, whatever, wherever we need. I'm pretty solid for all of that. (chuckles) Yes sir. No... No sir I do not have green card, and I do not see that in job description either or the previous round. So why don't you tell this before? Why shouldn't this be the first question don't you think? You have been just wasting my time, by all the interviews giving the false hope, just to tell me that I just can't get this job because of the green card. Thank you. Hi. So, how did it go? Uh, I didn't like it. I mean, it's because of green card and they said they can't sponsor green card. Not having green card is becoming an issue. What are we going to do now? Baby, I was thinking maybe you could get a second job. Are you kidding me? I come from a rich family. I'm not working. No part-time job for me. But, but it, it's just for some time. But see, I'm trying right? All I was thinking is you could help, right? (Monica whimpers) It would get us some time. Maybe you're the problem, because you have no talent. Maybe you're right. Maybe I, I don't have talent. Dunno why my father chose you. I don't know why he likes you. See, I worship your father. I think he just started like me from scratch. Before marriage... You know... Can't believe you comparing yourself to my father. He's my father, and you are my husband. There is no comparison, no comparison. Do you hear me? No comparison. (Monica gasps) What comparison huh? You don't do anything needed. Instead of supporting me. Always talking about money, money, father... You make my life a living hell. Do you understand that? There is no comparison, do you hear me? No comparison. What are you standing there for? Go apply for more jobs, you need to work. (tense music) (Arjun whimpering) (silently sobbing) (crying intensifies) (birds chirping) (keyboard clacking) Did you find a job yet? Not yet. Are you serious? I just had four interviews but... I don't care. When are you going to find a job? You're good for nothing. I don't know why my father arranged for this marriage. I'm trying. No, you're not trying hard enough. Seriously, you have one week to get a job. If you don't get a job, I'm gonna leave you. Do you hear me? I'm gonna leave you. You can't do that to me. (door slams) (phone ringing) Yeah this is Raj. Hi Raj. Oh yeah... Tell me. I see you're looking for a wife, and I'm interested in your profile. Oh wow, thanks. Yeah. Are those all your properties? They're beautiful. You own a business?
