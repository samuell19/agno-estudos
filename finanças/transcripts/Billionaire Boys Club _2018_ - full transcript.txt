Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK DEAN [V.O.] Here's the dirty little secret about being rich. It's not about the money. It's about the way people see you. The way you see yourself. Fuck money. For kids like Joe Hunt and me, being rich is about respect. [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ] My name is Dean Karney. I grew up with parents who were middle class... the opposite of rich. But they wanted the best for me... scraped together tuition fees to send me... to the most elite prep school in Los Angeles. The Harvard School for Boys... where I first met Joe... the scholarship kid with no friends. The only thing we had in common is that neither of us belonged. I learned early on that the key was to fake it... until you make it. I'd use my charm, wit, and backhand... to hang out with the sons of movie stars... CEO's, actual royalty. I played the part perfectly. By the time I was 25... I signed a deal worth a quarter of a billion dollars. I had it all, the house, the money, the girl. And I had the best partner, Joe Hunt. In Beverly Hills, the dream isn't a better life. It's the best life. So, let me go back. It all started six years after high school and let's just... say that I wasn't exactly living up to my full potential. Are you ready to buy a car, you handsome son of a bitch? What do you got? Well, I got a Bentley. Boring. What? You don't like a Bentley? I got a 1979 IROC driven by Stallone for three months. I got a Corvette. Let me see the 'Vette. DEAN [V.O.] And there he was, my old classmate. He hadn't changed a bit. If we take the over and the under-- DEAN [V.O.] He was still the smartest guy in the room. Still wearing the cheapest suit. Sorry, ahh... Corvette. Mr. loku... thank you. Dean.Joe. It's been forever.Way too long. Come here, man. So, making moves, what have you been up to? I am working at the Pacific Stock Exchange. Wall Street of the West, nice. And what are you up to? A bit of this, a bit of that. Are you living downtown? I'm still living with my father. Are you shitting me? Are they not paying you? Barely. Is that cash? Yeah, I just sold the Biltmores a Corvette. Joe, you shouldn't be working for these guys. You should be these guys. You've gotta get your own thing. Thanks, I appreciate it. That would take investors, and money, and things I don't have. You know, we would make the perfect team. Come to Spago tonight. It's Charlie Bottom's birthday. We could go talk to him. Charlie Bottoms from high school? Yeah. Yeah, I don't think he's gonna want to give me his money, Dean. Of course, he will. Just do what you did to those guys. You know, pitch 'em gold. I don't think so. These guys hated me in high school. I can't. Yes, Joe, you can. With your brains and my connections. Think about it, we could own this town. That's a yes, right? That looks like a yes to me. Okay.Yes, Joe! Okay. So it is Spago at 9:00 and it's a costume party. We'll both go as Reagan"s. You're going come, right? Promise? Yeah. Okay, cool. See you later. It's great to see you, man. DEAN [V.O.] L.A. was never a nine-to-five town. Deals were made at night at places so exclusive... just getting in meant you had your checkbook ready. Most exclusive of all was Spago, which is where... Charlie Bottoms was holding his 23rd birthday bash. Halloween in July. Sorry, kid, it's a private party. Oh no, I'm invited. I'm here with Dean Karney. Oh yeah, sure you are.Yeah. I pity tha muthafucka'! Back of the line! No, it is Charlie Bottoms birthday and I'm joining him. Make a hole! Make a hole! Get out of the way. Ladies. Dean! Hey! [DEAN] Joe!There he is. Joe, what are you doing? Come on in. Charlie will be 24 by the time we get inside. Come on, Mr. T, may we? You got it.Thank you. Dude, what happened to us both being Reagan? We are both Reagan, I'm Nancy. It's called edge, come on. Holy shit. Right, I told you, dude. Ladies, it is so good to see you. You're late. And you are beautiful. You are forgiven. Charity case? Old friend.I'm Joe. DEAN [V.O.] The girls at Spago were out of control. We ran with a pack of babes called, The Groovers. When any new scene hit LA... they were always on the crest of the wave. J They're making it your intention J Love those dreams Scheme those schemes J DEAN [V.O.] You don't come to California for the sunshine. You come for girls like Sydney Evans. Mean Dean. Hey, Delicious. You know her?Are you ready? What was that for?Edge. There they are! My boys! Gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you... our semi-assassinated President, Joe Hunt... a very close friend of mine. Joe, you remember Kyle and Scott Biltmore. Man, that shit is twisted! I love it! DEAN [V.O.] This crew was the epitome of a good time. Which meant the world clamored to be around them. I once watched Tom Cruise's date excuse herself to go... to the ladies room, only to leave out the back door... with both Biltmores. Then there was Charlie Bottoms. Aside from being blessed with good looks... he was a mastermind in business. And what did all three of these Harvard alumni have in common? Money. These were the richest kids in Beverly Hills. Happy birthday, Charlie. Thanks for coming. [ FUNK MUSIC PLAYING ] Got you a gift, Charlie. What's this, gold? I've been studying the market going back forty quarters. And if we invest in gold right now. My dad is in gold. And he says the market's gonna tank. How is the system going to handle that? That's why we reverse gold. We buy and sell a pair of puts and calls... and set a spread against volatility. Hold on, shut up a minute. Hey, did we go to high school together? No, no, seriously he looks familiar. Shit! Yeah! Hey, I fucking know this kid! He was the one who was thrown off that debate team, right? And then I stuffed the guy in a locker. We reverse gold. Okay, I've got a Macallan...We reverse gold. Macallan 12, a Glenlivet, a Makers. Happy birthday, Charlie. Hey! So, Dean, you got that ten grand you owe me? Or my Corvette? No, it's back at my house. I'll bring it to you in the morning. Dude, we gotta get you outta the valley. Dean, I will never freeze up like that again. I know, brother. I believe in you, man. [ TV BLARING ] ED MCMAHON [OVER TV] Here's... Johnny! Thank you, the recession has hit Rodeo Drive. I saw a guy filling up his Rolls-Royce today... at the self-service island. Yes, and it's depressing in Beverly Hills... during a recession. It's depressing, you see people lined up... with food stamps to buy Haagen Daz. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ ALARM BLARING ] Took you long enough. I called you hours ago. Have you even slept? No, Dean, sit down, the Biltmores, Charlie, all them. Their names have given them everything they could ever want. Except purpose and responsibility and self-respect. They've never had to worry about how to cover a car payment... or how to make rent. Things everyone else stays up nights worrying about. So, of course, when I showed up with a flake of gold... and asked them to invest, it didn't mean anything to them. These guys, they don't care about market analysis... or projections or any of that shit. They want to be part of something? Exactly. And every business needs its founding priniciples. You've heard of Steve Jobs? Yeah, of course. Remind me? Steve Jobs, he is 26 years old. He's living the American dream. He dropped out of college and now he's worth $149 million. How? Because he took computer technology and made it simple. He's selling the future. Read this. Paradox Philosophy. Turn bad into good, even wrong becomes right. In the right context, you could take yesterday's failures... and turn them into tomorrow's successes. This is rad. What's the BBC? It's the name of our company. What does it stand for? Remember that poker game... we could never get into in high school? No one will know. But, to us, it'll mean attaining the unattainable. What's that? Kyle's apology. Ten grand. Holy shit. Turn it into 20 and everyone of Kyle's friends and family... will be lining up to give us their money. Between word of our success, and this... it'll spread across Beverly Hills like wild fire. DEAN [V.O.] Before you turn your nose up... at a measly ten grand... remember, these were the Reagan Years. Gas was 91 cents a gallon. Cigarettes were a buck. And $10,000 was pretty close to the yearly income... of an average family. Joe took Kyle Biltmore's money and invested in gold. In three weeks it was up thirty five percent. We couldn't lose. These look great. And you wanted to use staples. Okay, so we gotta be at the Biltmores by 6:00, right? Let's hit the racks down at Nate and Al's. I gotta check the closing price on gold. Well, aren't we up? Yeah, we were up this morning. But I gotta check the closing price. Okay, I just gotta make one stop first. I just sold this guy a car last weekend. Nice, huh? Yeah. [ DOOR BELL RINGS ] Mr. Karney, he's expecting you.Hi. [RON] I want you in the front row at that court house... all right, on his face, with your camera... the moment the judge reads those charges, all right? Every other journalist is gonna want the same fucking shot! All right? Come on, get up, now! I want you to play rough. I want you to claw their fucking eyes out. I want you to tell them you work for Barbara Walters. Tell 'em you are Barbara Walters if you have to. This press badge will get you access everywhere, all right? Listen to me, front row. That close up of John DelLorean? I don't want you to miss it! Do you understand? Yes, sir. Ah yes. Bon jour, combien allez-vous payer des photo de Jon Delorean? [ PHONE BEEPING ] Ah oui, merci. Nigel, we're a go. Yes. Buy GM the moment that those charges are announced. Yes, at 52 and a half. That's right, thank you. DEAN [V.O.] Ron Levin was a force of nature. Oh, hi, Giselle. Hi, it's Ronnie. Yeah, I'd like three chopped salads. DEAN [V.0.] Made a fortune on Wall Street... with the Rothschild Group before going west... to dabble in any deal he found interesting... lucrative, or both. No, you're staying for lunch. Yes, and some Tiramisu with three spoons. Thank you so much. [AUTOMATED VOICE] Warning! Warning! Bullshit alert! Dean, show me. All right. 1962 original patina. Solid chrome. Yeah, but Dean, these are not in mint condition. These have not been stored properly. I am not paying $2000! No. I will pay you at most $600 for the whole set. And who is your friend, Dean? This is my partner, Ron. Do you remember Joe Hunt, I was telling you about. Oh, right, yes, Dean told me you're a trader of sorts? Yeah, that's right, Mr. Levin. It's a pleasure to meet you. I notice you have the afternoon edition. You mind if I take a look?No, go right ahead. Thank you.Joe is a genius. This guy had like a six-- What? Rough day in the market? No, not at all. You know, Mr. Levin, it's really an honor meeting you. I'd love for you and I to sit down... and speak through my investment strategy. I think you might find it very interesting. Are you familiar with the commodities market, Mr. Levin? Am I familiar with the commodities market, Dean? Hm... why don't you tell me. Holy shit. That can't be real. What is it? It's a Bulla... Sumerian's used it. They put those tokens inside their clay pot... and marked the day a commodity was delivered. It's-- it's 5,000 years old. No, it's actually 6000 years old. You're looking at the world's first futures contract. Must be worth a fortune. Do you want to hold it? Are you kidding me? No. Just be careful. 'Cause it's worth a lot of money. Shit! Oh my God. Oh shit! Dean, go find a broom.Okay. Please tell me that was insured. I'm so sorry. Insured? That was priceless. There are only 17 Bullas on the entire planet. And every single one of them... is locked in a museum. It's a fake. But you thought it was an original. Yeah. And why? Because the perception of reality... is more real than reality itself. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] DEAN [V.O.] The Biltmore's parents had taken off... to Europe for the summer. So the boys had turned their home... into their own private clubhouse. The place was always crawling with Beverly Hills royalty. Mean Dean gonna get this show on the road, or what? Probably boning in the bathroom. Go get him and hurry it up! Dean, we took a hit in the market today. What? How bad? We wiped out. All of it?Half. The rest is still in the account. Yo, Dean, your guests are waiting! Uh, just give us a second, Kyle. Wait, what are you doing? I'm giving Kyle his money back. What, you're gonna tell him now? After the presentation, in private, yes, I have to. What presentation, Joe? There is no way these guys will buy... our pitch if Kyle's bitching about a wipe out. I know, but I don't have a choice. All you have is your rep. Dean, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy. He knew there were risks when he got involved. He doesn't know. What do you mean, he doesn't know? There was no apologies? You gave me his money without him knowing? Sorry, I wanted to put wind in your sails. I should have told you the truth. But think how many legends started exactly like this. The Kennedys were rum runners before they ran the world. This is our chance, come on. Gentlemen, if I can have your attention, please? Thank you for coming by tonight. Some of you may remember my friend... Joe Hunt from High School. We spoke to some of you guys at Spago around three weeks ago. If you can't remember the night... it's the night Charlie has been trying to forget ever since. No way. But I'm not the guy to talk to you about the minutia... of why we are here. So, Joe? You want to-- Want to tell them about our proposal? DEAN [V.O.] You want to talk about a paradox? Joe's bad break was our lucky day. When he got caught in my lie... we broke through to a whole, new level. All he had to do was cross one tiny line. Gentlemen! You are the young Turks of L.A. heirs to empires... sons of scions. But, what would you do to earn it on your own? To look your fathers in the eye, not for a handout. But with a handful of cash, that you pulled down, with this! Dump the opportunity at your fingertips? Fuck no! Seize it. Now is the time to own your own destiny... and become part of something great! The BBC. What does BBC stand for? Exactly. Within that question lies our hook? Each investor will ask, "What is BBC?" Are we a holding company? Are we an investment pool? Are we a social club? All the above. Buy on mystery. Sell on history. I like it. Sounds like old money. Fuck old money! How about we make some new money? We all stand on the verge of wildly profitable ventures... in this room alone. Scott, you bought a Benz in Munich, drove it... across Europe and sold it right here for twice what you paid. That is a hundred percent profit. Charlie, how many times have you advised your dad... on energy stocks, only for him to make the big move. And Kyle, you believed in my trading system... to the tune of $10,000. You what?I did? Yes! You did! And here's your first disbursement check! Wait, five thousand dollars? Is this what's left? No, that is profit. DEAN [V.O.] Instead of admitting we lost five grand... The rest is still in gold. DEAN [V.0.] Joe told them we made five grand. Fifty percent, in three weeks. Yeah. God damn. This is just a loan. Okay. What do we do if he asks for his money back? Look, Dean, this weekend? You're gonna scrounge up every dime... So we can reinvest and make his money back. You got it, Joe. So guys, think it over, let us know. We'll see you later. Bullshit. You guys are coming out with us tonight. [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Yo, Tim! This cash machine, right here, is my new best friend, Joe Hunt. If he ever waits in line again, and I'll sic the wolf on you. He doesn't mean that, Tim. Pleasure to meet you. Welcome to Spago, Mr. Hunt. Thanks, Tim. Hello, Tim. Ladies. Gentlemen, if I may. To Paradox Philosophy. Wait, wait, wait, Para-what? Paradox Philosophy. It's our theory that is outlined in each prospectus. Three weeks ago, Joe blew his pitch to you guys. And tonight, he made you five grand, Kyle. That is a paradox. Winning by losing. Seeing the paradox allows you to do things... that you thought you couldn't. Cross lines you said you wouldn't. For example, Charlie. What is the worst thing you can imagine doing? The worst? Murder? Okay, perfect. So could you kill someone for a million dollars? No. See? That's a line you can't cross. Yeah, but who would? Well, no one here for sure, but-- Kyle, what if you walked into a room... and your mother was being raped? Would you kill then? If my mother was being raped? Yes, well, fuck yeah. Yeah, but under those circumstances, anybody would. Okay, so then change the circumstances... and you'll cross that line... the line you said you wouldn't cross. So by shifting your perspective you can justify anything. Justify, that implies right and wrong. But if you reconcile your perspective... then right and wrong become relative. Chateau la fete Rothschild, 1959 finest Bordeaux. Hey, yo, we didn't order that. This is complements of Chef Puck's closest friend, sir. Dean. Excuse me, boys. He asks that you go alone. That's okay, come on, Dean. I think he's awful. You think he's talented? Yes, I do. Oh my God, his art is-- Graffiti, first of all, looks bourgeois. No, it doesn't. And all of his art looks like it's finger painting. I love finger painting, it's so mature. Oh, that's why everyone thinks he's a genius. Because you love him, and you say it publicly. [WARHOL] So? But I'm telling you this, no one is gonna remember... Jean-Michel Basket-- Basquiat. Basquiat... in like, 15 minutes. Forget about it. You came to say hi, and you brought Dean anyway. Mr. Levin, I want to say thank you for the wine. And but of course I had to bring my partner with me. Well, I guess I'll have to respect that. But if you don't call me Ron, I might have to murder you. And this is my friend, Andy. Andy, Joe. It is a pleasure to meet you. [WARHOL] Nice to meet you. Andy is in town doing, are you ready? An episode of The Love Boat, with Milton Berle. Oh, and apparently Milton Berle has a Love Boat... between his legs. [WARHOL] It's true. Any dick contest, he takes out just enough to win. It's as big as a salami.It is? It's big, it's like huge.Wow. Do you like salami, Joe? Who doesn't, dude? So you know, Ron. We just cleared fifty percent in three weeks. Really? And I thought for sure you took a horrible beating... this afternoon. No. I shorted gold hard and made out like a bandit. Well, that is quite a return. I'm serious. We really should get together and talk about you investing. You see I knew it the moment I saw you, Joe. You're a hustler, just like me. Thank you so much for coming to say hi. You will excuse us, won't you, Joe? Of course, of course. Joe, this is for you. Sugar, because you are so sweet. Thank you so much. I say we write two checks right now, bro. Think so? I fucking know so, bro! Hey this goose shits golden eggs. Hey Joe! Joe! Hey, can we have a word real quick? Our dad is always riding our ass saying "Think about the future." Well here is our thoughts. Kill it. Yes! Yes!Go make us some money. Have a good night. Hey, your name is Sydney, right? And you are an artist. I work for one. No, I hear you are a really talented artist. Dean told me. Right? We have an investment company. And I was just talking to Andy Warhol. Do you know Andy Warhol, have you heard of him? Come see me! Obviously yeah, you have heard of him. Yeah. But, I'm you know, trying to land people like Andy. But I don't know anything about the scene. It looks like you are getting to know the scene pretty well. No, the art scene. I don't know the first thing about it. So, I was thinking, maybe you could tutor me? Tutor you? You know, give me a crash course in art. I don't know anything about it. I got this for you. It could be down payment on a crash course. I'll think about it. [ ENGINE STARTING ] DEAN [V.0.] Joe sold the world that night. And the Biltmores' money put us to work. Before the Euro, there were these things... called Deutsche Marks. And dollars bought German shit for dirt cheap... that we could sell here for a hefty markup. We made a deal with Scott's guy in Munich... and the BBC entered the gray market. [ ENGINE REVVING ] The M635-CSI was the nastiest thing on the Autobahn. You have heard of an M5, or an M3? This was the first street-legal M class ever. You couldn't get them in America. Which meant everyone in L.A. wanted one. Give me the keys. They're in the car. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ DEVICE WHIRRING ] Have you driven a new car before? This car is worth more than my apartment. Are you sure you want to put miles in this puppy... before it passes smog? [ ENGINE STARTS ] Oh yeah. [ DOOR BELL RINGS ] So, the BBC has a motor pool now. Come on, I gotta get dressed. So, let me get this straight. You buy them for ten grand in Germany, pass smog for five... and sell them in Beverly Hills for $70,0007? $80,000. It's a five-fold profit. Ron, you can share if you go in on BBC. I'm thinking twenty grand. Fifteen grand. Ten, we can start small. I spent ten thousand dollars on dinner the other night, Joe. You could buy a Chrysler for that. Which is exactly why I called it the Chrysler Dinner. Which is a steal compared to the Lincoln dinner... I'm throwing tonight at Mr. Chows. Joe, you think too small. Maybe if you are gonna pitch me... you ought to think about adding a digit or two. Because when I go in, I go all in. Okay, get your checkbook out. No, no, no, it's gonna take more than a 635-CSI... to get my check book out. I invest in relationships, Joe. Not deals. People, not stock. You read our prospectus?Yes. And I made some notes in the margins. You're kind of all over the place, Joe. Low risk spreads on high commodities. Performance BMW's in the gray market. And a gold mill? Ron, that gold mill is the deal of the century. I'll tell you what I did like. Go to the first page. That is interesting. That is the essence of success. Reminded me a lot of when I got in hot water with the SEC. Oh, don't worry about it. Anybody who knows what they're doing... eventually gets flagged by the SEC. You should wear it as a badge of honor. I had been working at Rothchild for a year. When suddenly I found myself thrown in front... of a discipline committee and was forced to defend myself. And I had nothing. 21 stories and none of them good, so I came clean. They take your license? No, I mean they could have, they should have, but no. Because what I was doing wasn't illegal... yet. I was ahead of the law. I mean, it was unethical and corrupt. Immoral if you believe in that sort of thing. But it wasn't illegal, so they had nothing. So guess what they did. They asked me to write the code... to prohibit the kind of trading that I had been doing. How brilliant is that? That hearing made me with the SEC. And I realized that day that... sometimes the truth is the best lie. Why come to me? Your father certainly has his wealthier friends. But none he respects more. DEAN [V.O.] Our first investors became... our number one sales team. Just the kind of investor... we wanna do business with at the BBC. It's not at all about money, Mr. Baxter. DEAN [V.O.] And Joe's strategy put us on the map. It's about integrity. DEAN [V.O.] The only difference between a nobody... and a player, is an address. Think about this, Uncle Hank, 286 horsepower... and you are the only one at the LACC driving one. Dad, you know I don't take investing lightly. And I've never come to you before. I mean, I really think this is a winner. BBC is ground breaking. Doing things that is revolutionary. And with the same principles Granddad had... when he started the family business. I like the sign. The bold makes a statement. It is bold and beautiful, right? If you'd like to come through... this will be our conference room. I'm not just a member of the BBC, Mr. Baxter. Line two. Yeah, yeah, ask my father. I believe in Joe Hunt. I believe in his vision. This is the easiest money you are ever going to make. I mean, Joe got me fifty percent in three weeks. Fifty percent in three weeks. Total Mad Maxing the market. I'm talking, blows the doors off of anything... you can get you'd make at Shearson Lehman! Kind of sounds too good to be true. It looks true to me. DEAN [V.O.] We pulled in everyone. BBC was no longer our game. It belonged to all of us. It was a family, which was the secret to the BBC. I'm in.All right. DEAN [V.O.] We wanted members with friends... and families who were titans of the west coast. I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.How much? Call. Boys! Come on, guys. Come on. Gentlemen-- DEAN [V.O.] But Ron didn't trust outside brokers. Insisted on using his own. RECEPTIONIST [OVER SPEAKER] Good morning, Morgan Brokerage. How may I help you? Hello, Frank Piedmont please. RECEPTIONIST [OVER SPEAKER] One moment. FRANK [OVER SPEAKER] Frank Piedmont. Hello, Frank, I'm here with Joe Hunt. FRANK [OVER SPEAKER] Hey, Ron, hey, Joe. Good afternoon, Mr. Piedmont. Ron has told me about your unique trading system... in the gold commodities market. I'm impressed. That's not easy to do. Most people lose their shirts if they stay in gold too long. I'm sorry to be so direct... but I would like to check the balance in the account. Frank, do you mind saying that one more time? FRANK [OVER SPEAKER] At closing market today, the account... balance was four million, one hundred thousand... two dollars and five cents. Thank you, Frank. Joe will be back in touch very soon, I'm sure. Remember the butterflies in your gut right now. And know that is the show. You sell a BMW, you pay your rent. You refine a tanker full of crude... you cover your overhead for a year. But if you perform on the account I just handed you... then your lives will never be the same. Think big and you will be big. Unless, of course, I got you boys wrong. I mean, after all, what does the BBC stand for again? Oh right. Bitching Boring Crew? The Brainless Boneheaded Cartel? Or are you, the Billionaire Boys Club? DEAN [V.O.] One Ron said think big, we took it to heart. From now on, every check that came in... went towards more luxury. Which meant more loans. Billionaire... Or bust. As one of our first investors, Mr. Baxter... I wanted to come by personally and deliver this check. 50 percent return, just like we promised. I don't normally invest, but I have to say that the BBC... has really struck a cord with me. Especially watching young men like yourselves. I can only hope my sons follow in your footsteps. Which is why I've decided. And invest it for them, in the BBC. Hell, I even took out a second mortgage. I'm hooked. I'm hooked. DEAN [V.O.] You're probably wondering why we would take... his money when we just got four mil from Ron Levin. We weren't actually holding Ron's money in our hands. We were just authorized to trade that money on his behalf. We were paper rich, but cash poor. Dean, look at this. That's his kid's college fund. That is the house that they live in. We can't keep promising fifty percent returns. We are committing fraud. Should we give it back? Honestly, Joe, the only difference between high risk... investing and a Ponzi scheme, is how it all ends. That check is just one more reason, to pull it all off. You know what beats a kids college fund? Four kids college funds. We are gonna make Baxter SO much money... he pays off both his mortgages. And sends every kid to grad school. Hi, I'm meeting Burt Langdon. Oh, Mr. Langdon just called. He wanted me to tell you that he had a family emergency... and that he will call you tomorrow and he was very sorry. Oh, thanks. Okay, so who has got the big schlong, is it Scott or Kyle? What? You are sleeping with both of them! No, but it is kind of a disaster. Something is very wrong with you guys. Are you following me? What? No, I had a meeting here. I think he is stalking you. No, I swear. You can ask the hostess. We're kidding. I have to go meet Dean. No, you don't. Such a nightmare when your girlfriends hate your boyfriend. Oh-- Come on, I'll take you to see Scotty boy or is it Kyle? Whoever is home. Love you, babes.Bye. See you tonight at the gallery.Bye. So, do you not like Dean for Q? Or do you just not like Dean at all? I am not a fan of Mean Dean. Mean Dean? Why does everyone call him that? You don't know? In third grade he burned down the game room at Camp Tawonga... and blamed my cousin Jake for it. Jake got sent home for the entire summer... and Dean won the camp tennis championship. That's not a coincidence. You are talking about third grade. A leopard doesn't change its spots. Actually a leopard does change its spots... according to Scientific American. Are you always this ahh, literal? Oh yeah, always. Do you want some? No thanks. I'm good. Do you not drink? I've actually never had a sip. Tell me more. What do you want to know? Everything. Wow, okay. Yeah, I'm from the Valley. I went to Harvard School for Boys on a full scholarship. My mom left when I was 15. So I choose to stay with my dad. Okay, your turn. I grew up in Beverly Hills. I went to an all-girls high school. My parents are still together, happily if there's such a thing. Have you always wanted to be an artist? Always is a strong word, but yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Cool. And you said you had a show tonight? Not me, my boss. [JOE] Oh, is his stuff any good? I'll let you be the judge. Was that an invitation? Hey, Dad. Where did you get all the fancy clothes? At Armani, they're nice, right? With the way things are going... we're not gonna have to worry about anything ever again. I'm gonna set you up.You're gonna set me up? Yeah. BBC is really taking off. I'm going to get you out of this shit hole. I thought that the one good thing I did in my life was to get you an quality education. So you can have a better life than me. But had I known that you were going to emulate these people that think they are better than us. Joe, it has been my experience, that if you are honest... in business, things don't happen this fast. You worry too much. [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Dude, this suit is lethal. Joe, gold was down 15 percent at the bell. It'll correct. What do you mean the installers broke it! I'm sorry--Just get out of my sight! Now! You look beautiful. Hardly. Nice suit. Look, if you ever want to be taken seriously... in the art world, you'll run. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sydney. Seriously, you are going to let this guy bring you down? This guy? Look at his glasses. He looks like Clark Kent on Quaaludes. They are very fashionable glasses. Seriously, Sydney. How many people would be here tonight, if it wasn't for you? How many of these ideas, did he run by you? He's lucky to have you. So lucky-- Come on, let's go fix this thing. I think I got it. [ MUSIC PLAYING ] You didn't have to stay. You kidding me, this is rad. J Looking from the window above J J It's like a story of love Can you hear me J & Came back only yesterday Moving farther away J J Want you near me J All I needed was the love you gave J J All I needed for another day J g And all I ever knew Only you J This is our ticket to the deal of the century. It was originally built for gold, but Joe thinks... we make a fortune using it in the energy sector. So there's a company in Chicago, it's called Cogenco. They turn oil-burning furnaces into coal. But they are in Chapter 11... because they still haven't figured out how to grind it. So you want to use a gold mill for coal? This deal, is worth a quarter of a billion dollars... in the first three years. And we are using your money to buy it. Told ya, Ron, Joe is a genius. Yeah, I know you told me, Dean. But it is a forgone conclusion that everything you say... is completely full of shit. Is that the bouncer? That is my new bodyguard. Why do you need a bodyguard? Exactly what we want each share-holder... to wonder when we walk in. Tim, it's good to see you! Good to be seen. DEAN [V.O.] Cogenco had big debts, $3 million worth. We agreed to pay them off using Ron's money and in exchange... the board agreed to sell us the company and merge it. All we had to do now... Ladies and gentlemen. ...convince the shareholders. I stand before you today with a proposal. So what's the question? The 1,000-pound elephant in this room... is 'how old are these boys?' Well let me tell ya. I'm 24. My Chief Operating Officer, Dean Karny. He's 25. In fact, there isn't a single member of BBC Consolidated... that's over the age of 30. And that should scare you. You're damn right it does. Because you have no clue how we solved in a matter of months... what 10 years of R&D has landed you $3 million in debt... and one vote away from bankruptcy. Inaction right now will render you extinct! But guts right now will make you rich! The choice is yours. DEAN [V.O.] Three hours after walking into that room... we left with a deal for two corporations... twelve million in stock options... and patents worth a quarter billion dollars. Fuck Google. Fuck Facebook. Fuck them all! We were the first. This house was inspired by Richard Myren. Three bedrooms, two baths. It can be rented unfurnished or fully furnished... that's up to you. What are we doing here? What do you think, Dean? We owe disbursements to everyone... and no one is reinvesting. How can we afford this place? Ron is wiring us our half of the profits next week. Then we own Congenco and a deal worth $250 million. Wow. Remember when you said you wanted to get me... out of the valley, Dean. Yeah. Don't tell me you don't want to wake up to this every morning. [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Do you realize the kind of whales... we can reel in with this place? This place legitimizes us on the ultimate level. A couple of turntables by the jacuzzi. Paint that pool purple and this place goes off like an ICBM. And you, my friend, can say goodbye to Mean Dean forever. I hate that fucking name. ♪ Home it's where I want to be & J Pick me up and turn me around J J I feel numb born with a weak heart & J 1 guess I must be having fun & But, Ron, the check still hasn't landed. Oh, that's strange, they were wiring it... from New York this week. I'll have to call Frank on Monday. Listen, it's been a month and I need the money. I'm in hot water, okay. I spread myself thin with this place... and the office and Congenco. And I've sort of been-- Diverting investments to pay expenses. Yes. Wait, you knew? Joe, I'm from Wall Street. Do you think people really get rich playing by the rules? Now open the door. J Dashing through the snow J With a straight-edge razor blade J J Bags and bags of blow & We'll do it until we fade J Hundred dollar bills really gets you high & J If you go and ride that sleigh J You'll move up to the sky [ MUSIC PLAYING ] DEAN [V.O.] Our Christmas party would be talked of... written about and remembered for decades to come. We weren't just players. We were untouchable. It looks like the parking lot of a Dead show. Let's do some acid! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Charlie! You've gotta meet this guy. This is the next Michelangelo. This man is an artist. Hey, I'm Mark. Yeah, Mark Mahunny, don't be modest. What are you, like a painter?Plastic surgeon. He is doing my tits! Look I don't want to be a downer... but our Dad's up our ass the account disbursement checks. I got something better for you. All right! It is secret Santa time! Gentlemen? Here, open your envelopes. Profit sharing wasn't just a pitch. You boys remember when I said this is our thing? That's your share in the BBC. Okay, so what are these-- Worth?Yeah? Your shares are worth 500! Holy fucking shit! No, no, wait, this is fucking Biltmore money! This is your money. Thank you for believing in me. Give me a fucking Kiss! Wait! Wait! I can't stand it anymore! Open sez-a-me! Holy fucking shit! It's a Rolex! Two months ago I told you to think big and tonight... you stand before me as giants, and frankly... I'm a little humbled, and that is pretty fucking rare. So proud to be a part of it! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] J Let's dance J For fear your grace should fall & Joe. Joe... You meet the guy wearing the fez? That guy is a real-life prince. So is every Persian in L.A. No, really, his dad is like the Sham's minister of oil. He means Minister to the Shah... Joe, Joe, what you have here at the BBC is stunning. It's so good. It's like a fucking family, man! DEAN [V.O.] Izzy was Charlie's friend. They met one summer in Greece. Like most Beverly Hills kids, Izzy hated his father... but he had good reason. His dad was literally a world-class asshole. He was wanted by Iranian Intelligence... and was on the FBI watch list. Okay, time to go home.Okay, okay. Somebody put this guy in a cab. Bye. Bye, Charlie. Bye! In you go, Izzy. Joe, I'm serious, I want to join the BBC. Come to San Francisco and meet my father. He's a very wealthy man. Okay, Izzy, we'll talk soon. Can't believe you're leaving me at Christmas. What's London got that I don't got? Hmm? Snow. Oh, there's plenty of that here. Huh? There we go. You're such an idiot. I am a charming handsome lovely idiot that you cannot resist. You know that's empty right? No... Go on then. Go home. Uh-uh-uh... patience. Now, have you been a good boy this year? Yeah, very. I find that hard to believe. I know. Hey, I love you, too. Whoa. What is that? Nineteen sixty two, Derringer four barrel. I found it at the Costa Mesa gun show for two hundred bucks. Restored, thing's worth ten grand. See, Dean? Even my body guard is an entrepreneur. Ryan, get me Frank Piedmont. FRANK [OVER SPEAKER] Hello? Hey Frank, it is Joe Hunt. Just calling about that final disbursement check. Ron's bank in New York still hasn't received it from you. Disbursement? You did send it, right? Okay, wait. Is this a part of the story? What story? The story, Joe. Joe, what's he talking about? What story, Frank? FRANK [OVER SPEAKER] Are you messing with me? Does it sound like I'm messing with you? Joe, listen, Ron told me he was a producer for network news... doing an expose on your gold system. He got me to issue statements on a phony account. DEAN [V.O.] And that's the day bombs dropped. Phony? Yeah, the money was not even real. Phony? What's phony? It was all part of the story. He had a camera crew in my office... filming me during our first call. What do you think? DEAN [V.O.] Turns out Frank wasn't Ron's broker at all. He thought Ron was a network news reporter... doing a story on investing. I'm the only one who knew there is no money in that account. Stay on the line, Joe. DEAN [V.0.] Ron conned him into pretending the account... was real, so that he could use it to get a $1.5 million... bank loan from somebody else. 14 .4 million in cash? In an account at Thorton Brokerage? How long will the approval take? Won't take long at all. Joe? DEAN [V.O.] Ron was big time, all right. Big time con man. But if you perform on the account I just handed you. I invest in relationships. People not stock. Joe, I'm from Wall Street. Do you think people really get rich playing by the rules? [SYDNEY] Joe! You're never gonna believe what happened today! Joe, my pieces are gonna be in a show. What's wrong? Ron Levin burnt me down, Syd. What? There wasn't ever any money in the account. Why would he do that? Because, he's a hustler. Just like me. Look at this. Tim has a friend at the LAPD. Ron is under Federal indictment in three states. For bank violations, larceny, check kiting, and postal fraud. Postal fraud! I am such an idiot! You know how much money I put into Congenco at this point! Everything! And now it's fucked! I am such a fucking idiot! Fucker! An idiot! Mother fucker! Joe, Joe, stop, stop, you're gonna hurt yourself. Stop! Sydney, look around! Look at this house, and the car! And my office! Is all gone without Ron's money! I'm fucked! Okay, just calm down. I don't understand. He gave me a Rolex. It's the nicest gift anyone's ever given me. It's ticking. The second hand on a Rolex sweeps. It's a fake. What if we just leave town for a while? Just while this all blows over. Syd, I can't just leave town. I owe a lot of money to a lot of people. Real people. Retirement plans, and college funds. I need to pay them back. Beautiful. Okay. Ron! Oh, no, he's fine. We need to talk. Nicholas, meet my broker, Joe Hunt. Spending some of our money, Joe? Looks like a perfect fit. Well, I wouldn't expect anything but the best. Thank you, Nicholas.Thank you. Network news?Oh. You conned me.Ah, is that what you think? Yes, a phony bank account with no money in it. An expose for sweeps week? You have been playing me this whole time? Did you ever believe in me? Yes, and yes. You know, Nicholas I don't think... these are gonna fit in my trunk. Why don't I come back next week and try the smaller set. Look, there is a perfect explanation for all of this. Okay, I'm all ears. Excuse me, Mr. Levin? Would you allow us to take them outside and check? Well, if you insist. Oh shoot, I was right. So close. Well, why don't we go ahead... and try the smaller set while we're out here. Excellent idea, Mr. Levin. Give us one moment, we'll be right back. Thank you. You can do anything in Beverly Hills with a Rolex and a Rolls. Fake Rolex, Ron? Swing by the house, Joe. I'll explain everything. It's not nearly as sordid as you think. Oh and Joe... do me a favor. Tip Edwardo for me. What do you mean, Ron's burned us? Where is the money? It was never there in the first place. No, wait. What about the shares? Huh? BBC's finished, Kyle. You know, I can just see the look on my old man's face now. Yeah, no shit. God, I just want to squash that bug. Maybe we should. Should what? Fuck him up. Well, he's con man. What's he gonna do? Go to the cops? Yeah, seriously. What would you guys do alone in a room with Ron Levin? What would you do to make him give us our money back? What, hypothetically? Yeah. I say we bust in there, we explain the situation! Yeah, with a gun; to his head. But put gloves on first. Tie that asshole to a chair, pistol whip the fuck outta him. Tape his fucking mouth shut So no one can hear him squeal. Torture the shit out of his dog. Twist his its fucking ear off. I hate that mutt. Kill it. Right in front of his face so he'll piss his pants. You motherfuckers are crazy. Alright, what else? Dig a pit. What's worse for the BBC? Ron Levin out for revenge? Or Ron Levin in a pit in the middle of nowhere? Hmm? Are we still talking hypothetical? [ DISTANT SIRENS WAILING ] I want you to scare the living shit out of him, Tim. Ain't nothin' sketch a motherfucker... than cockin' that hammer back. You can't point an unloaded revolver at someone. If he sees that there's no bullets in the chamber... he's gonna know the gun's empty. Then we're fucked. Then we hit 'em with the Brown Betty. [ DOOR BELL RINGS ] Just a minute. You stay here. Hey, Joe. I'm so glad you came. I knew you would. I wish you'd called first, but I won't hold it against you. Ron, I haven't been straight with you, okay? There are people in Chicago who are after me. I told them about Frank, and they lost it... and they said they were coming after you. What the fuck! Ron! Tell this guy right now how you conned me! Christ! You son of a bitch! Tell him how you made money off me! Jesus! Fuck you!Tell him! [ WHINING ] No! No! Put him down! No! Not Kosher! No! [ COCKS GUN ] Where's the fucking money! In the top drawer of the desk in there! Put him down, please! Put him down! I really hate to disappoint you, but this is not the first... time I've been tied up and had a gun in my face. You conned me for a bank loan? Wait, you think I used Frank to con you? I used you to con Frank. Wake up. It's called a convincer. Jesus. You know, you really don't scare me at all. Joe. Listen to me. You're a natural. You're born for this. You're just like me. My God, I can teach you so much. What did you say? It's gonna cost three million to close Congenco? We'll make more than that in a month. And we won't have to split it with fifteen people. You want to play in the big leagues? Do yourself a favor. Put the gun away, and get on a plane with me tonight... and come to New York. And start working together as we should, as partners. You want to be partners? Of course. Put the gun down. All right, let's start right now. Cut me in on my half of the bank loan. Okay. Here's the check. That was easy. Just ask next time. You can untie me now. Looks real alright. Oh my God. Tim! You brought the door man! ...1 got him his job. You probably didn't know that. I fucking vouched for you with Wolfgang. Are you fucking kidding me? This is like a joke, right? Are you really that low life? You brought the door man? Oh, I'm sorry, he's your body guard. You know what? Maybe I'm wrong about you. Maybe you are just a low life, two-bit hustler from the valley. And what are you? A schwartze on a leash! Why don't tell this ape to get his fucking-- What the fuck, Tim! You were supposed to scare him! Why are there bullets in the gun! We gotta draw a line. You were gonna partner with this guy? No! I was just saying that to get the money! Oops. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] Your father fell in love with a Geisha. She was a tea service girl. Yeah, it was fun. Enough about us. Tell us about you and this boy, who's 45 minutes late. He-- he's never late. Oh, there he is. Joe... Hi. This is Joe. Hey, Joe. So sorry I'm late. Traffic... Los Angeles traffic. Happens to the best of us. Right? So, Syd tells us that you are in finance? Any chance you are related to the Hunt Brothers out of Dallas? I don't think so. Well, it is a shame. You know I met Nelson a couple of years ago. He is a real character. Where're you from, Joe? Van Nuys. Hmm. Are your parents still there? I'm sorry? Your parents, are they still in the valley? My father is, yeah, yeah. My mother's not. She-- I don't know where she is. She is in Santa Barbara sometimes, maybe. Should we order more drinks? I could go for another martini. How about a bottle of wine? Joe, red or white? Oh, he doesn't drink. So, whatever you want, Daddy. Are you in AL A?Mom. What?He just doesn't drink. I really could use some water. Here, just drink mine. Joe, here. Joe, you have something on your collar. What?Momma. Your collar? Is that blood? Ahh... I was shaving... and I must have cut myself. Are you okay?I'm fine. Yeah, everything's... What's wrong? Joe, please-- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Evans, welcome back. Dean, how are you? You've been in Europe for a few months, right? We were in Japan. Just got back. Hey, Charlie. Oh, Charles, how are your parents? Are they still traveling? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're good. Excuse me. I just remembered I have a new client meeting. What? It was such pleasure to meet you Mr. and Mrs. Evans. Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe! Client meeting... I completely forgot. I should go.Yeah, yeah, no worries. I'm sorry, Dad. Darling, he is not a keeper. Joe! Are you okay? Huh? What happened? It didn't go according to plan. You killed him? Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Fuck Ron. He was a snake and he got what was coming to him. You did what you had to do. You did the right thing, Joe! You did what had to be done. Fuckin' come here. We can still cash his check. No one knows he's dead. You fucking saved us. [CHARLIE] Hey guys! They don't know. No handcuffs, no blood. Fucking Ron invested in Congenco and he went to New York. That's what happened. That's it.Okay. Right? Hey, hey. Dude.Where's he going? He's gotta go meet this client. It's a last minute thing. He doesn't need me though. We're gonna go inside and get a drink. I'll tell you about it inside. Come on, let's go in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see you later, brother. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] Hey, you wanna give me a hand here? Not really. Let 'em go. Careful with this stuff. Don't get creative. Just get it on his face. [ACID HISSING ] Syd, you awake? DEAN [V.O] Until Ron's check cleared... we were dead in the water. Desperate for cash. Investors were starting to get anxious. And they were still expecting their fifty percent returns. The pool has run dry, and we need cash now. Once Ron Levin's check clears, we're fine! Barely scratches the surface! If the BBC craters, every document from the past year... will be under the microscope of the IRS and the SEC. And when they find Ron Levin's name, the FBI. And when that happens? What do you think they'll do? I don't know, Dean. What'll they do? Joe, they could arrest you for murder. How? They don't have a case. Not unless someone breaks rank and testifies. You know me better than anybody, Joe. Come on.Yeah. You know that. But I can't speak for everybody else. Why do you think they call me "Mean Dean"? Why? Because you burned down the game room. I didn't burn shit! Jake Kastner stole those fireworks and then fucked me... in the ass with a Roman candle. I was in the game room getting my foos on... when all of a sudden he busts in like a fire bug with a Zippo. Alarms are ringing, and I'm like "Mr. Fox, I didn't do shit!" But nobody remembers it that way. Because he ran back to the cabin like a little bit-- Hey. Hi. He ran back to the cabins and told everybody... that I burned down that room. That it was my idea. Do you see what I'm saying? You know the law as well as I do. First one in gets the deal and-- Everyone else gets the shaft. So watch your back. That's all I'm saying. Joe. Ron Levin's check bounced. DEAN [V.O.] That's when we reached out... to Charlie's friend Izzy. The Persian Prince from the Christmas party. Izzy wanted into the BBC badly. He told us that his father could get us financing... from his filthy, rich friends in L.A... if we did the old man a favor. How well do we actually know this guy? Shh.He's connected. DEAN [V.O.] Izzy said that his dad was being watched... because of what a big shot he was in Iran. His fortune is tied up in foreign accounts. But we think with the help of our friend in L.A... we can recover the estate. Yeah. What Izzy and I were talking about is that maybe we can... find a way to sneak him down south. Get my father to Los Angeles, and we... guarantee a seven figure investment into BBC. A million bucks?Yeah, at least. DEAN [V.O.] A month ago, we were negotiating... a billion dollar merger. Now, we were talking about smuggling... an Iranian tyrant in a box. Yo, Charlie.Yeah? If you see anything, honk twice.You got it. Hello, Mr. Samed.i. Here it is, just like we discussed. So no one notices you leaving. This is just until we get you out of San Francisco. Dad, this was our idea. See? Lots of space. Yeah, it'll be fine. What? Papa? Izzy, what the fuck is that? It's opium, Dean. Opium. Ismael... You expect me to get in there? Okay, you do you want to try it? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sorry. Dad! To kill my one thing! [FATHER] These boys are idiots, just like you! Unbelievable. [ YELLING O.S. ] Well? Ah, he's changed his mind. He doesn't wanna go. This little excursion cost us fifteen grand. He is getting in the goddamn trunk. I've explained that to him, Dean. He's not in the mood. Oh, so ah... you have explained it to him? Yeah.I'm sorry, oh, okay. Maybe I need to explain it to him. Maybe I should explain it to him the old fashion way. [IZZY] Shut the fuck up, Dean, listen... [ LOUD CRASHING ] What the hell? Oh, god... Oh... fuck. DEAN [V.O.] That key was to a safety deposit box... in Beverly Hills, it was the Persian's nest egg. Now what? Put him in the trunk. Relax, if your dad jumps out, Izzy, Tim and I gonna grab him. Okay? Hold down the box. Okay, you ready?Yeah. He looks dead, Joe. No, he's got a pulse. Your dad ever overdose, Izzy? Yeah, once. He could be in a coma. Hey, Izzy. How much is in here? Five million. In diamonds. Shit... DEAN [V.O.] Depending on who you ask... will determine how the next part of story goes. Charlie says he was in he car behind us. And I think Izzy said he wasn't even there. And that leaves me versus Joe. Four friends with four very different points of views. Syd... hey. I need to talk to you, please. Joe, what's wrong? Leave town with me. Let us just go, you and me. Okay? We can leave right now. We can go wherever you want. Joe, my show is tonight. I know, I'm so happy for you. I'm going to go home. And I'll pack up our stuff... and we can take off right after the show. I don't think you understand, I can't go anywhere with you! Sydney, I'm sorry, I've been a shitty boyfriend, I know. But I love you. And I'm gonna make this... You have to let me make this up to you. When was the last time we even had a real conversation? Everything's been off! Okay? I-- it's hard for me to explain. How can you not see how alone I am? I do! It's this town! It's this town. They build you up to tear you down. You're never good enough. You know how hard it is to keep my stories straight? What? The BBC is full of cash. The BBC's flushed out. Ron Levin's gone to New York. Ron Levin's gone for good! What are you talking about? What does that even mean, "Gone for good?" Where's Ron Levin? You know what? I don't wanna know. Sydney, please. Can you please just give me another shot. I have to go.Please? Sydney, I'm sorry. Don't. So where have you been? I have people who just showed up screaming for blood. I think it was Scott. Fuck the money.What? I'm want to get outta here. Come on. Guys. Guys! Kyle, Scott! Come on, guys. Where are you guys going?We're goin' home, dude. BBC's falling apart.Falling apart? Come on, you guys have no balls! No, you have no brains! And there's no money. This is bullshit. Our Joe is fucking bullshit! This thing is ours. This thing is real! No, no, this thing is over. Come on. Look, guys. Oh, fuck. [ DOOR SLAMS I Sam? Where is Ismael? I'm gonna kill him. Joel [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] I got him, Joe! [ LOUD THUD ] Agh! Dean, Dean, Dean, are you okay? I'm not...It's okay. I gotta get some rope and tie this guy up. Joe. Don't go! Joel We have to turn ourselves in. What, are you high? Look, he was trying to Kill you. Okay? It's self-defense. Yeah, because we kidnapped the guy. It was a shake, in the trunk... he had a seizure and he broke his neck. Nobody's gonna believe that, Joe. There's way too much evidence everywhere. Alright. Okay, how do we spin this? We dump the body in the desert. We forge that conservatorship. Izzy won't care as long as he gets his money. He despised the guy. Otherwise this is kidnaping with aggravated circumstances. Forget life without parole. I'm looking at the gas chamber. We're looking at the gas chamber. Thanks, man. Don't you feel guilty? Guilty? For that sack of shit? Who beat his family? Put the screws to his whole country. Fuck no. I need to hold my head up, Dean. Instead of looking away in denial for the rest of my life. No, no. Don't you dare start freezing up on me now. Everything I've done, I've for you, and the BBC. You promised me, you said you would do anything for me... and you would never let me down. Don't you dare start now. You are my best friend. Okay. Dean, go home, take a shower, pound a bottle of Listerine. And meet me at the bank at 8:00 AM, okay? Don"t tell Izzy what happened to his father. Not until after we get the diamonds. Hey, we get those diamonds, Joe. We can forget any of this ever happened. Dean, we get the diamonds? I'm paying back those loans. And I'm out for good. You understand? You got it, pal. 8:00 AM. Syd Delicious. You look like shit. Wow, nice.Where's Joe? I don't know, Syd, he's your boyfriend. Well, were you with him tonight? Seriously? Deal with it yourself. What have you guys been doing? It's been a really long night, Sydney. So either shut the fuck up or get outta here! What, you're moving out? Yes. Now? In the middle of the night? Where's Ron Levin? You guys did something to him, didn't you? Well, I know that you did. And I can promise you everybody else will too. No, I didn't do anything to Ron Levin. Did you see Joe today? Hey! You know, you wish you could be like Joe. But you're nothing like him. You are really pushing it, Sydney. Okay? You ruined Joe. All he ever wanted was to belong. And you made him think he needed a BMW for that. Joe, could have been anything in the world! And now he is twisted and he is lost because you... fucking ruined him! No, Joe was locker fodder until he met me! A geek you never would have spread your fucking legs for. Where's Ron Levin? Huh? What did you do to him? What did you do! Do you really wanna know? Do you really wanna know? Fuck you! [ DISTANT SIRENS WAILING ] Joe? Joe, you okay? It all got away from me. All these little choices. Not even my choices. I need you to notarize a signature for me. Who are Hedayat and Ishmael Samedi? You don't want to know. I don't want to lie to you, okay? Joe... ...you want me to commit fraud for you? Maybe lose my license? I'm asking you to save me. Look, my father appointed me conservator of his estate. He's in Tehran. Apparently so. There a few more documents to sign... before we grant you access to the safe deposit box. Right this way. Are you alright? Do you know how many people I've lied to? Dad, do you know how many people I've hurt? I've taken things from people... I will never be able to give back to them. Never. I don't know how I got here. We'll get through this. Joe Hunt, you are under arrest for the charge of murder. Don't say anything, Joe. I'm getting you a lawyer. DEAN [V.0.] With Sydney asking so many questions... about Ron Levin, the cops were sure to connect the dots. From Ron, to Joe, to the Persian... to me. I tried to talk him out of it. But Joe and Tim went into Ron Levin's house. They forced him to sign the check. And they killed him. DEAN [V.O.] For a guy who saw all the angles... Joe should have seen this one coming a mile away. That's when Joe pitched his plan to me... Izzy, Tim and Charlie. The Persian sneak was kidnapping, extortion... and murder from the very beginning. I didn't kill anyone. I tried to save the guy. I pulled out a screwdriver... and drove holes through the lid of the trunk. So-- so that he could get oxygen. But when I opened the lid of the trunk and looked inside... Persian was staring back at me with his eyes all bugged out. And he was... he was dead. It was Joe. It was all Joe. DEAN [V.0.] I1zzy's father never made it to L.A. Yeah, we both thought so, too, but... Kill dog? You're free to go, Mr. Karney. But the State Attorney General's office will want to hear... that story again in the morning. From the beginning. Okay. Thanks. DEAN [V.O.] Our philosophy of self interest... brought us everything... and then it took everything back. In America money equals respect. It didn't matter how you got that money. You just had to have it. We thought we'd own the world. Turns out the only thing we really had was each other. But now that is gone forever. [ MUSIC PLAYING ]
