(dramatic instrumental music) (cow mooing) (chickens clucking) (dramatic instrumental music) (gasping) You, beggar, can you take it? (grunting and yelling) (laughing) Smoke. Go on and smoke. (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) (groaning) (laughing) Shit. Here. What do you want? A pack of cigarettes? Yeah (mumbling)? Dammit, you've been torturing me. That's why the smoke. What? Who do you think I am? Get him. (grunting and yelling) Who's that man? He's in a fight with (mumbling). Don't underrate him. He really knows how to fight. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) You want to smoke? Here you are. If you want revenge, just look for Chin Bao Pai. Hey, here's your dish. (crowd mumbling) - [Man] Really good-- Hey, Chang Lee. Huh? Here's your plates. (dishes clattering) Now you, take a bowl. - [Man] Have another piece here. Have one on me. (mumbling) Another one. (crowd mumbling) Here, take a plate. (dramatic instrumental music) (dishes clattering) Mr. Kao. (mumbling) Ah, Mr. Kao. Good day, Mr. Kao. (laughing) (yelling) - [Man] Here, drink up. Hey, what are you doing? It seems that he's really hungry. (laughing) But I'm sure he cannot pay the bill. Give it to me. (mumbling) (dishes clattering) (mumbling) What the hell is this anyway? (wood clattering) Shit, I've been here all day. I tell you what. I may be poor, but I'm not eating here today. (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) I'm just gonna invite you. Why must you leave? Here, take this. (grunting and yelling) This guy's (mumbling) stopping. He seems pretty loaded. That must be hell. (grunting and yelling) Come here. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) He's tough. (cloth thudding) (groaning) I say, mister, are you sick? No, just hungry. Oh, my home is quite near. Just wait. I'll get some food. (wood creaking) (dishes clattering) (groaning) Sorry, I just can't wait. (dish clattering) (liquid pouring) Hey, here's some more. Come, take it. (grunting) (laughing) Enough. (gentle instrumental music) Miss, you're kind hearted and pretty too. What's your name? I'm Shu Ling. Miss, I'm Mao Chai Kong. I'll never forget what you've done today. Goodbye. (laughing) You won't forget, eh? Shu Ling, are you the one that fed him? Master, I only-- He's a bandit. When I was not in the shop, he came in and ate, didn't pay, and fought. Don't listen to him. She'll listen to me. Why's that? 'Cause she works for me, and now you'll see what's going to happen. Get him. (grunting and yelling) (water splashing) (dramatic instrumental music) (grunting and yelling) (water splashing) (laughing) Dammit. Let's go. (men mumbling) (gentle instrumental music) Here, have this. (grunting) I'd rather suffer some more than drink this stuff. It may taste bitter. Don't be afraid. It'll do you good. Hold your breath and drink it down. (groaning) You see? It's not that bitter after all. Right. You must think I'm like a child. When they're sick, everyone acts like a child, so don't worry. Now behave and lie down. (groaning) Shu Ling, you're too kind. I wish I could repay you. Tai Chu, Chang Lee, come here. What's the matter? He just drank his medicine. Oh? Is that all? There's nothing more. I think up to now, you still don't know the relationship between the three of us. Mr. Mao? (mumbling) I know. He's your neighbor, and he's your brother. Am I right? He is his friend, and I'm his friend's friend. Oh. You mean, you are to be married. Not exactly. Shu's been here since she was a child. I'm sorry, Mr. Kao, but this man cannot see you. Give me a reason why not. No reason. (foreboding instrumental music) (yelling) You're still alive. So you people saved him. Are you trying to offend me? Master, we'd not dare to go against you, but to save somebody's life, it's a good deed. So Master, why don't you go home first? Get out. Easy, easy. Easy, easy. Master, please spare him. Please, just for my sake. Who the hell are you? So you people really wanna fight me? I suggest you'd better think it over first. (grunting and yelling) Hold it. I don't really wanna approach you, Mr. Kao. Beat it. (grunting and yelling) Okay, Shun Tai Chu, so that's the way you treat me. You don't hit me. I'll never hit back. (grunting and yelling) Mr. Kao, punch me as much as you want. Please let him go. (grunting and yelling) Don't go too far. Many more, and you'll be sorry. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) Damn you. You wanna fight with me, huh? (yelling and grunting) Come on, quick. (grunting and yelling) (laughing) Don't forget. You all work for me. I'm not paying you people to fight against me. From now on, you can consider yourselves fired. I want you to suffer and starve to death. There are three sinuses, the temple, the armpits, the heart, the weakest in a human body. You can't prevent when others hit you. It's the death sinus at your temple sinus, and now the armpits. (upbeat instrumental music) (grunting and yelling) Now hit the temples. Now your armpits and your heart. (yelling) - [Chang] Wonderful, good. Now recovered and completed my training. I must leave you. What is the hurry? Stay a little longer. I've got you in trouble. You lost your jobs. How are you gonna live? As long as we still have our hands, don't you worry. We will struggle on. I don't know how I'm gonna thank you all. Forget about it. Just work and show them you're not a nobody. I have faith that you'll succeed. When that day come, Mao Chai Kong will show you. I'll never forget all three of you for saving my life. (mumbling) - [Shu] Mr. Mao. What is that for? I'll repay my enemies, and my saviors, I'll think of them always. Okay, Shu Lin, sell all the crops we have tomorrow. Get cash for brother's expenses. (gentle instrumental music) Since we have vowed to be blood brothers, so let's be frank. In case there's anything you need outside, just send me a note. Chang Lee and I will manage to help you. If I take all the money, then she will-- Don't worry. We'll be okay. - [Tai] It's alright. I'll go now. (yelling and grunting) Hold it. What you doing? (grunting) (laughing) What's your name? My name (yelling). (yelling and grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) (dishes shattering) Come here. (grunting and yelling) Go and tell your boss Kao Liang to come to see me at (mumbling). (laughing) Better be there on time. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Kao] Who is he? Stop. Brother. Brother, you are back. You must be a big shot. I'm sure you must be loaded. (foreboding instrumental music) So it's you, eh? Surprised? Though I was a starving beggar, I've made it now. Even a tortoise will turn over sometimes, a temporary change, nothing more. Do you still despise me? When a fox puts on a tiger skin, he remains a fox. Rubbish. (crowd mumbling) (grunting and yelling) Get up. I'll kill you with three blows. (yelling and grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) Brother. Brother. (laughing) Brother. Brother. He's my brother, brother, brother, brother. You don't remember me. I'm Chang Lee. Brother. Brother. Sorry. (laughing) I don't expect he'll repay us. It's not surprising that he doesn't remember us. Let's just forget the whole thing. I think you're right. In this way, we don't have to worry if he's coming back or not. I'm sure there's a reason. He's not that type. Just imagine, when he's dealing when someone, how can he divert his attention and chat with you people? Anyone who helps the other should think himself as benefactor. A little error, he'll say that I'm grateful, and I was wrong. I think you two should visit him. If he's a little rude, don't get excited. After all, he's still your big brother. (foreboding instrumental music) You can go in now. Brother. Brother. How's it been these two years? (foreboding instrumental music) Not too bad. You guys here looking for a job? I'll never forget you for saving my life. Hey, kid, hey, what you thinking? Hey, Chang Lee, brother is talking to you. We're looking for a job. Show them the quarters. They'll eat in the mess. Yes. Follow me. Yes. Oh no, he doesn't ask me to polish. This is myself. I want to polish. Forget it. In fact, brother won't (mumbling) for not polish. Is that right? I want to go home right now. How can you? Remember, Shu Lin remind us. He is our big brother. We must obey his order, but, brother wants to arrest Chin Po Bai. Why is it? Don't ask question. Just do it. (phone ringing) Hello? What? You're not talking. Why should I? Huh? Chen Tai Chi? Huh? Hand it here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right, yes, governor. I'm doing right now. Yes, thank you for calling. Right, goodbye. Shun Tai Chu, come here. Go on. (liquid pouring) I think you are misbehaving, giving trouble, and that's why he treated you like this. Hey, easy. He's a big shot now. Many will come to him, and you two bumpkins keep embarrassing him. No wonder he gets sore. You just don't understand. Why don't you go and see yourself? I'll be there at the festival. (mumbling) Okay. I got some work to do. See you. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Man] You just go to the tea shop and wait. You'll see a girl name Shu Wen Lai. She'll be wearing a red (mumbling). Hey. (laughing) - [Man] When she seems disturbed by someone else there, you go beat them off, and then see her home. Listen, your target is her brother, Shu Shing Bao. (mumbling) (yelling and grunting) (dish shattering) Hey there, (mumbling) all your life. (grunting) Miss, are you alright? Don't worry. I'll see you home. Thank you. - [Man] Listen, the guy you want is her brother, Shu Shing Bao. Kill him when you got a chance. (gentle instrumental music) I'm Shu Shing Bao. Thanks for saving my sister. You're mister-- Shun Tai Chu. Oh, Mr. Shun, I'm pleased to know you. Wish I can know you earlier. Our country is in a turmoil, ruled by warlords. We need young patriots like you to defend the country and remove the evils. Sit down. No thanks. I'm leaving. Don't. I've ordered them to prepare dinner. Let's have a good drink. Yes. No, I've got to go. Hey. Hey. (dramatic instrumental music) Brother? Come here. (grunting) Don't you know our regulation? How dare you disobey my order? You did it on purpose, tried to wrong me, because you're jealous? Come on. Speak up. Answer me. If you didn't rescue me, I'd have you shot now. Shun Tai Chu, just tell me why didn't you kill him? Let me ask you. Are you treating me as your brother, or just a dog? It's official business. If it's official, then may I ask who are you working for? You mean you don't know? I'm the governor's adjutant. Of course, everything I do is for him. I always thought you were the head, but now I know you're just an adjutant, but you've been living like a king by using your power. Don't you know you're spending people's blood? Dammit. (grunting and yelling) Can't you see I'm not trying? (grunting and yelling) Tell me frankly. Do you want me to leave or beat me up? I think you can make your own choice. Good. From the time we came to work for you, I never once heard you ever call me your brother. We are not sworn brothers anymore. Please let me leave here. Let him go. Remember, you asked for it. If you can't make out in the future, don't crawl back to me. I won't have you. I will never return. Good. You've got guts. One, two, one. One, two, one. One, two, one. One, two, one. One, two, one. About turn. One, two, one. One, two, one. One, two, one. (crowd clapping) Right turn. Attention. Eyes right. Eyes front. At ease. (laughing) Fools, watch me. (grunting) (crowd clapping) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) Who the hell are you? (grunting) See my four students? (yelling) (grunting and yelling) Untie him. (laughing) Hey, what did I do anyway? Recognize me? Look carefully. Seems we have met, but where? (dramatic instrumental music) If you want revenge, look for Chin Bao Pai. You? I'm really sorry, sorry. (foreboding instrumental music) I wanna give you three tests. First, you swallow those cigarette butts. If you don't spit it out, I'll let you go. (grunting) (laughing) (mumbles) You're not trying. I didn't spit out the last time I tried it. Now, the second, three cigarettes, if you can pick up one, I'll set you free. (grunting and yelling) (laughing) (yelling) (upbeat instrumental music) (grunting) (yelling) (grunting and yelling) Disobey me? Brother, you say if he can pick one up, then he can go. We must keep or word. That was the same way he treated me. You have a very good memory. I swore our revenge. But if you say so, one must pay his benefactor. What? This is outrageous. How dare you? Brother, I'm not trying to hurt you, but if you still think I am your brother, let me out of here. Sure, as repayment, just tell me. What do you wish before you leave? I don't want anything, just hope your (mumbles) will pay. (laughing) You certainly know how to pick soft spot. Okay, I'll fulfill obligation, but don't ever say how you suffered for me, your generosity or your kindness. You only make up this word by yourself. We never said it. Goodbye, Mr. Mao. Chin Bo Pai, let's go. Chin Bo Pai, why you have to stay with me at supper? Go back to your village. I live a single life. No, I understand now. One day, that bastard will get what's coming to him. I want to learn from you. Then I can repay you. Repay me? (dramatic instrumental music) Go to hell. I don't want anyone to repay me. Watch out. Rickshaw, rickshaw. Stand aside, rickshaw. Stand aside. Hey, look. (grunting) What's the matter with you? I just saw some guy. He passed by bringing a rickshaw. Tai Chu? Where is he? He's gone. Why didn't you stop him? How do I know you're looking for him? Let's turn. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (yelling) It's you. (grunting and yelling) Rickshaw. Make way. Make way. (dramatic instrumental music) You have eyes. Rickshaw has none. It's no fun if you get run down. (grunting) What are you doing? None of your damn business. I've warned you too many times. Don't interfere with our governor, and you still keep on writing. Since your ears are useless, you don't need them. Cut off his ear. (grunting and yelling) Who are you? I'm a rickshaw puller. Well, go ahead and pull. Anytime. You move aside, and I will pull. You wait till I cut off his ears. Then go. Oh no, he had ears when he got on, so he'll have ears when he gets off. You stinking fool. Get him. (grunting and yelling) Hey, you saved my life. Please get on. What? Me? What for? I'll pull you back to thank you, eh? Nevermind, we poor men have to eat by pulling. You have such good skill. Why waste on this? You should join us to wipe out the warlords. I wonder if you'll agree. Sure. Come. Get on. I will pull you back and have a talk. How could you do that? Take it easy. No. No, no, it's okay. Come on. Oh, come on, come on. (upbeat instrumental music) (mumbles) Look, Shun Tai Chu. Huh, huh? Stop, stop. (yelling) - [Both] Brother. Brother. (groaning) Have mercy. Please spare me some coins. So, are you (mumbles)? (dramatic instrumental music) (yelling and grunting) (wood clattering) (dramatic instrumental music) Thank you. Hey. You better watch out. You mean somebody's after me? Right. Where is he? Right here. Right here? Who are you anyway? Mao Chai Kong. (dramatic instrumental music) (mumbles) It's alright. Have a good look. I'll be the last person you see. (grunting and yelling) (laughing) (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) Come down here. I'll kill you with three blows. (yelling and groaning) Who can be that vicious? The governor has a bunch of thugs. They used to be rascals. They're aiming to kill our people. I heard the leader is one of his colleagues. Is his name Mao Chai Kong? It is. You know him? Must be him. I know just the way of his fighting, death boxing. If we don't get rid of this man, then we won't be able to stop their scheme. There's something more. Mao Chai Kong said this house is the rebels' headquarters. Anybody stays here will be killed one by one. I'm not afraid of him. If he can use his trick, I can (mumbles). (dramatic instrumental music) (yelling) Wu Nan. (grunting and yelling) (bricks clattering) Get up. I'll kill you with three blows. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) (yelling) Are you gonna talk? Speak up? (whimpering) Speak up now. I will look for Mao Chai Kong. (mumbles) Chang Lee, Chang Lee. You mustn't go. Don't worry. I will try not to fight. Maybe he will be (mumbles). What if he refuses? If not, I have to fight. About his death boxing, I think I know his trick. Maybe I can win this time. Wait. Maybe we should wait for Tai Chu and see what he thinks. Waiting for him? He will never let me go. Hey, I'll go with you. Do you wanna die? But I think, don't worry. I will bring him back. (mumbles) Mr. Shun comes. If you promise me, we still can be good friend or brothers, or else, we pay you the money you want, but you still want to fight. I'll fight you. - [Man] I want to see blood again. (mumbling) - [Man] Get out of here. Get out. (grunting and yelling) Easy, save your strength. We've one more round. (pottery shattering) (dramatic instrumental music) Well, it's our turn now. If I had not saved you, then we wouldn't be killing each other today. You're right. Time changes. It's just fate. If you had known then, would you have saved me? (laughing) Don't regret this. It's fate. All wicked people, they all find excuses to justify themself. Make no difference what you say. We still fight. Come on. (grunting and yelling) Okay, you're using that to fight me. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) Brother, you'll have to reincarnate to revenge. Brother. Hey, Chin Bao Pai, if you want to repay him, you can help a corpse. Brother, brother. (groaning) Hey, boss, you shouldn't let him go. Let him die home. Save a burial. What time did he go? About five hours ago. It's been quite long. He must be in trouble. I'll go and see him. Tai Chu, don't get excited in case-- Even if I have to die, I'm still going. You brothers talk the same way. (groaning) Chang Lee. Chang Lee? Brother. Chang Lee. (groaning) What happened to him? Mao Chai Kong. (yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) Do what we can. Take him inside. Hurry. Get a doctor. Yes. Brother, what do you want to say? Brother. (dramatic instrumental music) (yelling) Brother, you're a somebody now. Very good. It's kind of you to call me brother. That shows you remember that the three of us have been vouched before God that we're sworn brothers. (laughing) How could I forget? Ah, here comes my savior. Tai Chu, why didn't you tell me you're fighting with somebody? Hey, you're wrong. Shu Lin, just not anybody, it's me. I really missed you. You're prettier than before. Brother? How come you never visit me? Don't cry, Shu Lin. This is fate. It's all prearranged. Tell me why you're so ungrateful. If everyone acts like you, there'll be no peace. That's all their fault. At first we were brothers staying on the same side, but they insist on working with Shu, and now we're enemies. What do you think I should do? You have a very sweet tongue, but your heart never crossed paths with your mouth. I just wanna comfort you before really dying and make it easier on me as well as you. - [Shu] Tai Chu. Move aside. (grunting and yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) (mumbles) Listen now, Mao Chai Kong. The way to break your skill was taught by Chang Lee before he died. I was wrong. I should have sent him home. (groaning) It's prearranged by God. Now you've had it. (groaning) Brother, brother. Shu Lin, if you only visited me, then it would not be-- (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) Brother, why, brother?
