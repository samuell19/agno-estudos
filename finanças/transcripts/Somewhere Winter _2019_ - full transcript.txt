[DINO Films] [HG Entertainment] [Maoyan Entertainment] [Sparkle Roll Media] [The Dream House] [Tencent Pictures] [Wolf from the north, Chyi Chin | Chyi Chin | I love you] [Concert 1991; Typhoon 91: Chyi Chin China Tour, Beijing Workers' Gymnasium] Any tickets left? I won't bargain! Hey! Stop pushing! Thanks a lot! Any tickets left? - Move aside! Get out of the way! - Give it to me! My friend can't make it. I'm giving the ticket to you. [Beijing Workers' Gymnasium Admission Ticket; (Double) Row 2 Seat 10] Make a run for it. The show is about to start. I have a ticket! He should have been a wolf born in the cold north but he came from the far south. It's about to start any minute, be quick! [Somewhere Winter] [2019 Los Angeles] Hi Miss An, looking for Xiao Nian? Why are you here? Grandpa's critically ill. We need to go back to Beijing. When? Tomorrow, 10 p.m. flight. Tomorrow 10 p.m.? Why couldn't you discuss it with me earlier? Could you ask people to die later? No need to pack too much, there's plenty available back home. Let him go. He's tired. Grandpa can't even talk now. How do you know that's what he wants? Grandpa knows I can pull the plug. That's why he asked me to come back. You know you're good at pulling the plug! If you didn't insist on taking him home back then, if you let him go through his chemotherapy, he might still be living well now! Xiao Nian... Don't go just yet. Xiao Nian... Listen to me. Anybody home? Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach! Make it go away! - There, there. There! - Where is it? Okay... It's dead now. Thanks. Who are you? I'm Qi Yitian. I'm from Taiwan. Is this... where Professor Yu lives? You're a bit late. Grandpa passed away three days ago. Did you say your last name is Qi? From Taiwan? Is your grandpa Qi Guolin? Do you know him? I've been going through my grandpa's stuff lately. Look. These were all sent by my grandpa. Your grandpa had kept them all. So many letters... It would have taken him years to write. The elders certainly had good patience. They were very close friends. Ever since my grandpa left Beijing when he was 17, these two never saw each other again. Look at this. We have this photo at home, too. Grandpa's gone, why haven't you cried? That's right, you didn't shed a tear when dad was gone, either. One day, it'll make sense to you... Goodbyes are easier with the dead than with the living. No wonder you were once a TV host. You have the gift of the gab. I'll go visit your maternal grandparents in Chengdu. You can head back to LA by yourself first. Here's some cash for you. What if I spend it all? Better than nothing to spend at all. You took quite a lot of photos in Beijing these past few days. Yeah, so I could show my dad. Qi Yitian! Here! Why do I think I've seen you before? Why do I think you've stolen my line? [Past & Present of Kun Opera edited by Yu Feng] You like Kun Opera? I'm studying it. ♪ We've never met ♪ ♪ Why are we here? ♪ You! Don't laugh! My dad worked on this book. He was an editor. Later, he went abroad and became a Chinese language professor. He had a lot of foreign students who wanted to learn Chinese. He had a way of getting people interested in China. Your dad sounds awesome. I've got something to show you. My dad's a photographer. [Forever Love] These are some old pictures he took in Beijing. This is my first time here. I'd love to explore the city to see what my dad might have seen in Beijing. To feel the youth he had by walking the streets he had been to. This is my dad. Would you happen to know... Where can I get this kind of beaded bracelet here in Beijing? Why are you looking for it? This was my dad's favorite bracelet. I didn't know better, so I flushed it down the toilet when I was little. Sometimes, not knowing the answer is better than knowing it. Hello, Beijing!

Sun Yaoyao, you're strangling me! Go, go, go! My bad, my bad, my bad! Qi Xiao, tell me you love me! [Forever Love Photography Studio Preparation Office] You've been drinking? It's cold in here! The heating is not enough and there are mice! Let's go to a proper hotel, okay? I've got the money. I told you this place isn't for you. Yet you still want to come here. I missed you. Why don't you go back to Taipei? I've got things to do here in Beijing. How could I go back to Taipei? Work matters more to you than me? When my photography studio here starts making money, I'll be able to afford to marry you. I don't want to be a model anymore. I want to be an actress. Are you absolutely sure? I might become famous and rich! You won't need to work this hard. Don't throw a tantrum, okay? No matter how hard I work, it's not too hard. I came all the way here to pour my heart out to you. Consider yourself lucky! Yes. I'm very lucky. I"m going to bed first. I'm thinking of getting double eyelids. Luo Youjun thinks my eyes are too small. They aren't big. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. If my eyes are the size of soy beans, he ought to see them as large pearls! Yaoyao, you really believe in love? Why, don't you? The day I bump into Chyi Chin on the street... will be the day I believe in love. I can't think of anyone who'd want to marry you. I'll make sure you're the godmother to my kid. Auntie! I just bought this roasted sweet potato for you. Taste it. I'm waiting for a very, very important letter. When it comes, please be sure to look after it. Don't lose it. You know the rules. No love letters! Is that clear? Auntie! Do you think she'd get love letters? Auntie! It really is very important! Please make sure you look after it! Auntie! You have to try this sweet potato. It's as sweet as first love. Go away! Thank you, Auntie. Auntie...Any letters for me? No. Still no mail for you. Xiao An! Auntie. Hang on. Here, take it. Sweeter than first love. Thank you, Auntie. Is that all? [1993 Beijing] Can I have a copy of the list? Thanks. Thank you. Xiao An. I got here early, picked this up and read it. I think these few items will suit you. Why don't you go check them out? What about me? I get it. She's your cup of tea. I heard you've applied to study abroad? For someone who's such a patriot, why are you thinking of leaving the country? I want to go abroad so more people will know about China. Let people know China better! So how's the progress of your visa application? My dad's not happy. He won't give me our household register. He doesn't want you to go. Enough about me. Take a look at this list, seriously. Hurry up and fill in the form. [Forever Love Wedding Photography Studio; From Taipei] If we want to take a photo of a boy, we can try lowering the camera to make him look more manly. With girls, we can try to raise the camera angle a little higher. That's why in photography, you all need to pay attention to– Boss, the samples for new album deisgns have arrived. The new photographic paper you asked me to order are also here. Okay, put them here. I'll check them out later. Boss, there's one more matter... Miss Ye's agent called again from Taiwan. Are you sure about not renewing her contract? They said the fees can be kept the same. Not renewing. Haven't I already told you so last week? Then I'll go put out a new recruitment ad. - Go ahead. - Is this angle okay? All right. Let's try to take a photo to see how it fares. Come on. Let's do it. Where should we put this? In the basement. Put this one there. Just put it there will do. - Someone's been shopping! - Grandma Yu. Juzi is back. Go inside. Come with me. All thanks to your dad. He made sure that I benefit from the new quota. (The import custom of China in that era) Three large items and five small items. (Pertaining to household furniture and appliances) My dad talks about you all the time. He said when he was in middle school, they were poor. He said you always shared what you had. He never felt left out. The two of us go way back! When are you making a grandpa out of him? Excuse me. Checkmate! You're just like your dad. I shouldn't have taken my eyes off the game! Professor Yu! Xiao An and I have come to see you! Come on in! Let me introduce. This is Qi Xiao. He's from Taiwan. My old friend's son. These two are my students. Xiao An, Xiao Sun. Compatriot from Taiwan! A very warm welcome to Beijing. There you two are! Hi, Madame. These are specialties from Sichuan. My parents insisted on bringing these here and hope you all will like them. Just come, there's no need to bring us anything! Please accept them, Madame. These are their gesture of respect for you. Please accept them. Xiao Qi is a professional photographer. He has a wedding photography studio in Beijing called Forever Love. It's doing extremely well. When you two are ready to get married, go to him to have your wedding photos taken. Wedding photos! I'm just doing my best to live. Come, come, time to eat. Coming, Madame. Madame, is your son not at home today? He's working overtime at the publishing house. Very busy. Are you accustomed to living in Beijing? Yes, I am. I really like it here. That's good. Beijing's wonderful. What's so good about going abroad? What's the point? Professor Yu, is the list of us staying in the department confirmed? I have to inquire. Xiao An, if you don't get to stay in Beijing, do you really want to go back to Chengdu? I haven't made up my mind. Young ones, as long as you are capable, you have nothing to fear! Wherever you go, you know you'll make it, no matter what. That's right! By the way, I quit smoking recently. Not smoking anymore. The cigarettes you brought here, take them back. Don't squander your parent's hard-earned money. Money doesn't grow on trees. Here. Try this dumpling with cabbage filling. Try it. So you're from Sichuan? Sichuan's good. It's the land of plenty. I've been to Chengdu, picked up a trick or two for spicy hotpot. If you all are up for it, I can make it next time. Eat up. It's been a year. I didn't expect to see you here. Didn't you say some paths are meant to cross? Talking about that, I'm a bit embarrassed. I still owe you that photo. Not at all! I was asking a bit too much at that time. No, it's all my fault. I remembered you wrote down your address. I placed it in my pocket, and somehow, it was nowhere to be found. If I'd known you're Professor Yu's student, I'd have given you the photo in person. What do you like about Beijing, Mr. Qi? Stews, lamb hotpots and candied hawthorns. I feel that this city is inclusive. Everything is possible. What about you? What do you like about Beijing? It's big. I came here because my enrollment to the university was accepted. When I first got out of Beijing's train station, I was speechless. This city is enormous! It just seems endless... no matter where you look. I also find the people here unusual. Whether they are on bicycles, or crammed in the subways, they all look strangely energized. That energy is what makes me want to stay here. Stay here to fulfill my dreams. What're your dreams? Some day... Beijing will know my name, loud and clear. Like what you did at the end of the concert? Shout out Chyi Chin's name, loud and clear? Chyi Chin! He's gone! He left. He's gone! I wasn't that ridiculous! You were! Thinking back... I was worried that... you'd fall and break a bone. Then I would have to... bring you to a hospital. If I did break a bone, that'd be okay. We wouldn't have waited this long to meet again. Don't you think it's destiny's best outcome? Are Taiwanese men good at smooth-talk? Just cross out "Taiwanese," that works, too. Was I really that embarrassing that day? Not at all! You were just a bit... emotional. Very excited! Chyi Chin! He left! He left! Chyi Chin! Stop copying me! That's crazy! Students, your good grades are helpful in our bid for the Olympics. In recent years, the standard of sports in China has been raised. It has become advantageous and has advanced our bid for the Olympics this time. I finally found you. Let me show you a fun place, come with me. See you! [Forever Love Wedding Photography Studio assists in the bid for the Olympics. Beijing will win!!] Sure. - Hello, Boss! - Hello! - Thank you! - Did you like it? - You've made our day! - Of course. Take care! Thanks! - This is my assistant, Xiao Jing. - Hi, Boss. She's very pretty! Mind your own business. Hold on. You two can move a little closer! She's holding flowers, not a gun! Get cozy! It's okay... Smile... Three, two, one. Nice! Very nice! Carry on! We're doing a special promotion. For 10 senior couples in Beijing who are celebrating their golden wedding anniversaries, to be photographed here, on the house. What does it take for a couple to spend 50 years together? It's beyond my imagination! My private collection. Mister, you have violated my image rights. I know... and I shall pay the price. The usual studio photo albums, including wedding photos, come in hefty sizes. I designed these mini ones. These are more portable and gift-friendly. But I want to add some texts, maybe some quotes, because I'm not satisfied with the current ones. So I was wondering if you could help me? Do you trust me? I trust the zeal in you, and I think whatever you do... You'll do it well. Mister, this is only our third meeting. For some people, meeting 300 times means nothing. For others, meeting 3 times is enough. Do you think I need to have another squabble with Luo Youjun? The way I look isn't satisfactory! Why is it me? For some people, meeting 300 times means nothing. For others, meeting 3 times is enough. Hello, hotshot poet! Are you in love? Just helping a friend out. A friend? Which friend? Is it that... Taiwanese? I'm warning you! Taiwanese men... They are smooth talkers! Just cross out "Taiwanese," that works, too. These couple of months, you've tried your utmost to get a job to stay in Beijing. You've gone to all the interviews. Are you doing it for him? I'm doing it for myself. Bigger or not? Can you please be magnanimous and step away? I want to call the Taiwanese. Hello? Hello? Is Mr. Qi there, please? My husband is in the shower. Would you like to leave a message? I'll make sure to tell him. Come take a look. I bought this in Hong Kong for you. Do you like it? It's your dad's idea. He thinks you're having a tough life here. He asked me to bring you all the stuff. Alishan Tea (from Taiwan), the one you like. How did you get in here? I told the front desk that I'm your wife, and gave them your ID number from memory. With that, they let me in. I'll get you another room. Mr. Qi! It's been almost a year since you were last in Taipei. What's keeping you here in Beijing? You're the one who wanted to break up. Please be reasonable. I'm exhausted having to fly via Hong Kong to come to see you. Must you be so aloof to me? I'll go to sleep in the studio. Lock up when you leave. You're being unbelievable! Don't push for something you'd regret later! I'm missing that magic three. You should've said it. Now you're just saying it. Good kid, have some sweets. An Ran, come help me out. I need to pee. Really? Did you say you need to pee? What about "I need to go to the restroom"? What's up with you? Stop sitting there. Come help your auntie. Change of hands, change of luck. Hurry up. Hurry. I need to go very badly. I'll be right back. The luck is not with me. An Ran, aren't you graduating soon? Staying in Beijing and not coming back? It's not that easy. If you asked me... What's so good about Beijing? Their food is so bland! This is my colleague's son. He has a job in a bank, a steady income, and this isn't it. He's about to be promoted. His annual bonus is this thick! An Ran, don't you remember me? We went to the same elementary school, but not in the same class. This boy's good, they have a holiday house. We have a holiday house in the mountain, that should cover it. What's the smell? I'm not winning at Mahjong and I've burnt my soup. Mom, I'll do it. - Take the lid off, have a good stir. - Okay! What's this? Check me out! An Ran turned my luck around! If I stay at home for three more days, I think I'd lose my mind. My mom also brought me to a blind date today. The insurance broker comes with a house and a car. He said he can get me a job at the TV station. He didn't complain about the size of your pea eyes? He said I look like Anita Mui Yim-fong! (A Hong Kong singer and actress regarded as a Cantopop diva) A magnificent talent unmatched in her generation! I'm not sure about the 'magnificent' part, but 'unmatched' is rather accurate. Shut up! Yu Feng is now the head editor. What are you doing with that Taiwanese? I don't want to talk about him. Yu Feng is really good to you. Only if you'd try... It's possible that you'd fall in love with him! Is it that hard for you to fall in love? You can be divorced even if you got married. What utter nonsense! You're so full of shit! Are you passing through again? Let me help you with the luggage. I've got good news and bad news. Which one would you like first? I only want good news. That won't do. You're not supposed to wipe out the downs in life. You need both ups and downs. I've just had the ups and downs over 1,000 kilometers coming back here. Thank goodness I'm still alive. The woman sitting next to me insisted that I marry her son! I didn't get my visa, I won't be going to the United States. How's that possible? Now the good news. A newspaper editor saw your work, he's very interested in your work. As long as you pass their written test and interview, you'd get to stay in Beijing and work. Seriously? Yes. I'm always serious about you. Did you send them... my resume? Don't forget I'm in publishing. I put your work... into a book. Look. An Ran's Way. Thanks. You're welcome. Well done, An Ran! We heard of your special edition of 'An Ran's Way' which stunned the editor. It's really nothing. It's An Ran's writing that got her the job. She aced the test and interview. They don't know how lucky they are. Very lucky indeed! Look at our An Ran. She's got talent. She's also pretty! Once she starts working, the men will be lining up to take her out. You'll have to stand in line, too. Yu Feng is a VIP. He can skip the queue, right? What an occasion to be merry. Yu Feng, thanks for the treat! Hear, hear! Bottoms up! Yu's really nice! Can you stop talking? Thank you. Your call! He's been calling so many times. He said to call him back. A man surnamed Qi. He said he's Taiwanese. The Taiwanese! No way! It's Chyi Chin! Chyi Chin's been calling you! Quick, call him back! Quick, call him back! Don't mind me. You chat, I'll leave now. Have fun chatting! Okay. Hello? An Ran? Where have you been? What have you been up to? Why haven't you called? I did call you. Your wife picked up the phone. What wife? You're joking, aren't you? Stop lying. Why would I lie? Perhaps you've called the wrong number. I received the card you sent. It's well written. What's up? Are you in a bad mood? No, I'm in a great mood. I can stay in Beijing. I've got a job! That's great, let's celebrate! Tomorrow afternoon, 2 p.m., come to the Palace Hotel. My studio is doing a promotional event. Come have a look. Okay? I would love for you to come. Okay. Bye. Is that really Chyi Chin, the singer? No way. He's been calling you... Does Wang Zuxian know? (Chyi Chin's real superstar girlfriend at that time) When I came to Beijing for the first time, guess what was the hardest to get used to? Was it the food? The climate? Neither of those. It's taking the elevator. I get startled every time [Beijing 1994, Spring, Wedding Gowns Photography Seminar] when the elevator chides me with... Enough debauch. (The term in Hanyu Pinyin sounds like "Going down") Going down! I'm just having some fun with everyone. Forever Love is a unique photo studio because we're serious about photography. It's not just taking photos of wedding gowns. We capture beautiful moments. We tell stories. We help make memories. We're, in fact, making movies, movies of your own love stories. [For some people, meeting 300 times means nothing; For others, meeting 3 times is enough] This is a little token for you. I hope Ms. An will kindly accept it. Mr. Qi, you tried calling me all day yesterday just to give me this? I'd like you to continue helping me. So you like my talent in writing, is that it? Once, I heard such a story told on stage. Girls from the Northeast are after love, girls from Shanghai are after money, while girls from Sichuan... They are after your life! Please stop this... I'm just joking with you. Okay? Going down. Next stop. ♪ Give me a ladle of Yangtze River water, Yangtze River water ♪ ♪ That Yangtze River water that tastes like wine ♪ ♪ That taste of drunkenness is the taste of homesickness ♪ I wish my dad were here right now. He left Beijing for Taiwan over 40 years ago. He was always busy with his work, and kept putting off trips to come back here. What did he do? He was a teacher. History teacher. When I was 10, my parents got divorced. My mom moved to New York, and never came back to visit. I have an older brother. He's a man on the street. He blinded a guy during a fight. Got sentenced to jail for 10 years. So now there's just my dad and me. Not much to say between us. He's getting grumpier as he ages. He keeps telling me to get married and have children. I think... He's pretty disappointed in me. Not possible. He must be really proud of you. You think so? I don't think so, I know it! Enough about me. Today, for your smooth stay in Beijing, let's celebrate with a toast! Come on. No. We toast for the present. This peace of mind is my hometown. I wish we were in Taiwan. I can take you out for all sorts of nibbles... beef noodles, minced pork on rice, squid stew, mini steam buns, and when the night falls... We could go stargazing in Yangmingshan. Are the stars there really that great? It's great, especially with a girl to catch. Are you trying to catch a girl now? What do you think? Good night, Mr. Qi. Looks like you! Looks more like you! You haven't found the bracelet you wanted to buy, and you're already planning to leave tomorrow. That's not good. It's okay. There's always the next time. Thank you for hanging out with me. I'm about to leave, too. I'm also flying out of here tomorrow. Where are you going? Back to LA for school. I came back here to see my grandpa off. Then... When I can, I'll visit you in LA! Xiao Nian! My godmother is here. Well... Goodbye. Goodbye. Qi Yitian! Here! Will you forget me? Of course not. Don't forget to send me the photos. Go. Super Talk Show, Super Good! Hello everyone, I'm An Ran. We're super happy to have today... a super famous actress... Miss Ye Yuchen. [Qi Xiao, Ye Yuchen, 1995, newly married] She will share her life story. Please give her your warmest welcome. Miss Ye Yuchen. Holy Sh*t! [1994 Beijing] Everyone, meet the new addition! An Ran, a scholar from Beijing Normal University, a published writer, an amazing talent. She'll join us starting today. Please welcome her. Welcome! Thanks, everyone. Thanks for having me. An Ran, starting today, this is your desk. Yes, Sir. Lee! Please look after An Ran, show her the ropes. A new comer marching straight to the big jobs? Smooth. She knows people! Thanks. I'm sorry! I was held up at work. It's okay. Come. Here. My idol is so handsome! Take your time to browse. Boss, do you have the latest Chyi Chin's CD? Yes. Official copy. It's ¥58. By the way, do you think you can give me that poster? I'm a big fan. I can't give you that poster. All the fans are after it. It's staying. Would ¥100 do? I'll take it. Are you nuts? That's too much. Done! When you come again, I'll get you his signed CD! Your boyfriend's so nice. Chyi Chin! That poster is hard to come by. - Thanks. - Thanks. Anything else? No. I have other private collections. The Four Heavenly Kings (of Cantopop), Cantopop Diva Mei Yanfang (aka Anita Mui Yim-fong), Leslie, Alan, and Beyond. I'll give you a discount. That's not necessary. What's the hurry? Come back! This is it. You go in. I'll see you off from here. Okay, I'm going. Xiao Jing! [CAPITAL DAILY] Miss An, my boss asked me to come and give you this phone. Please hold on. Hello. I'm at Capital Daily. I've got Miss An here. Hello. Keep the mobile phone. Easier for me to find you. I can't take this! You can pay me back later. I'm on my way to the airport. I need to head back to Taipei. What's the hurry? Is everything okay? My dad's not well. Is he okay? He's been sent to the hospital. When are you coming back? In the winter, perhaps. Will you wait for me? [1994 Taipei] Steady. Almost done. Take it easy. What are you after? Pick a date... Get on with it. Do you get it? Faster! Faster! Card four... Someone good. Male. It's the last card. Last card! Hurry! Hurry! Three of hearts! Falling in love! You'll get married by the Chinese New Year! I don't have a boyfriend yet! You're lying! There's a saying that goes... nothing is impossible as long as you're shameless. Is this nearing the end? It's a bit late. Time to take a break. Sit. It's the weekend, give us a break. Moreover, don't you have other places to crash in? Let's carry on, carry on. Come on! You'd better listen up! I put up with you, not because I'm afraid of you. I can't be bothered, do you get it? Shut it now! Get out! Get out! All these days, thank you for taking care of him. Why don't you get someone to help look after him? You can't be around day and night. You'll break down, too. He's not having anyone else. This will do for now. Let's not talk about this. Do you know what your dad has on his mind lately? He hopes that we will get married. If you move your Beijing studio back to Taipei, I think we can make it work. Who's there? Qi Xiao. What will you do with your brother? Who's that? Friends of my older brother, you go back inside. Let's step outside. If you don't do something about it, we will... Hello! We're closed! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yaoyao's out of love again. She says she's coming back to Beijing. She says not to tell you... so it'd be a nice surprise! I don't need to be comforted. I'm as tough as I can be! Well... I-I... something just came up, I can't join you two for dinner. I have to go. Where to? Don't mind me. Qi Xiao. [From Taipei] Qi Xiao. What happened? Can't you tell me? I have to leave. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. You're leaving? Xiao An, I'm sorry. I can't give you the future you want. Let's call it an end. Call it an end? Did you hear what you just said? Like a fool, I've been waiting for you to come back. You disappeared completely. I missed you and waited for you. Waiting for the day you'd come back here. Now that you're back, you're telling me that we should call it an end, and that you're sorry. Do you also want to tell me that nothing ever happened between us? Don't be like that. Don't be like what? Can't you tell me what's going on? We can find a solution together. Please, tell me. Tell me. My dad had a stroke. He can't do anything without me. I have to be with him in Taipei. My older brother's causing trouble behind bars. My studio in Beijing is also falling apart. My business partner took all the money while I was away. All of those have nothing to do with us! Do you assume that I'm with you for the money? Of course not! Then what is it? Tell me! Don't push me! I'm not pushing you. I don't have the heart to push you. Xiao An! Falling out of love is a bit like... Getting through a very bad cold. Just hang in there. You'll make it eventually. Tell me... How do you erase someone from your head? Just think that he's dead. According to the rules, no outsiders are allowed to stay the night. Who's an outsider? I'm her insider! Dead. D-e-a-d. He won't die... What should I do with you? Can you not go? We can sort out any problems together. As long as we love each other, how would we not have a future together? I wish I could be as naive as you are, but I can't. Whenever you want to see me, you can come here as you please. But when I want to see you, I can't just go to you. Have you ever thought about that? Please look after yourself. I really want you to be happy. If you are willing to leave me behind, let's not meet ever again. This is the final boarding announcement for CA185 to Taipei. Your seat is 49E, right at the back. Hello Mister! Can I change seats with you, please? I'm at 49E at the back. I would like to sit next to my man. - Thank you! - Thank you! What are you doing here? Going to Taipei with you! Aren't you surprised! Surprised? I'm shocked! Aren't you going back to LA? Why are you going to Taipei suddenly? - Investigation - Investigation? [1995 Beijing] Come! Try my cooking. - What are you doing? - Don't move! The doctor said you need to rest and not move around too much till after the New Year. I especially made this pigeon soup for you. It's for your recuperation. Yu Feng told me. You made us worry! Don't run when you cross the road in future! If I didn't make a run for it, it'd be someone else's Breaking News! Listen to you! I have to say, your column is my favorite read in that newspaper. Thanks for the compliment. By the way, Yaoyao left a message. She has gone back to Harbin for the New Year. She said she'd come to visit you after the New Year. This Yaoyao... She's been working well, I don't get why she has to start her own business! I heard she took a loan, and it's in the range of millions! Scary stuff! Mom, it's not your business. In recent years, entrepreneurs made much more than employees! Come, come have a look at this. Old Qi's son got himself a wife! Look. Show me. He's ahead of me again! What a pretty girl. You can tell she's from a good family. Here, take a look. Well... I heard this New Year's Eve TV Special has a good line up. I'll bring you back to your dormitory after watching it. You just got your driver's license, be very careful. Come. Bring me the wine. - I'm having a drink with Xiao An. - Okay. Okay. The more the merrier, especially for this occasion. - Fill up the glasses. - Okay, I will. Come. I'm planning to quit my job. Yaoyao and Luo Youjun set up a production company. They're starting a new show and it needs a host. I would like to try it. Being a TV host sounds great. They can definitely do with someone intellectual like you. However, your current job is an iron rice bowl (secure employment). Have you thought it through? I thought about it clearly. If we don't make a move, life stands still. We should make some waves, don't you agree? It's important that you're happy. I hate to lose. Out with the old, in with the new! Am I... The old one, or the new one? Don't be late! The backdrop needs to go higher! Make sure the sides are aligned! Don't cut corners! We've got the best TV host in all of China. Some are destined to go nowhere. Some are destined to spread their wings and soar into the sky. Do you know what I like about you? You may not win all the time, but you don't quit! ♪ My wife and I ♪ ♪ are no longer slaves ♪ ♪ We're going back home ♪ ♪ You'll farm and I'll sew ♪ Let's drink!! I need to go to the washroom, you carry on! LuLu, Lulu! Come, sing with me! Where are you going? I've got a headache. Why don't you go after having a song with the rich guy? He said you look just like some actress! He asked me to get that actress to sing with him! What's up with you? Don't you see how important it is to get the contract? I know. But my job is to host the show. Nothing to do with this farce. Stop it. Don't think you are still working for the state business. We're now roped together. Who's roped with you? Look at yourself! What have you become? Not highbrow enough for you? Did you realize money doesn't fall into your lap? I have to beg to have the show made, then beg again for the show to be sold. You don't think I know what I look like? I don't care if you are highbrow or lowbrow, get back to the karaoke! Why don't you just leave it? Then you don't need to beg anymore. What's up with you? Do you need to be like that just because you've been dumped by that Taiwanese guy? Why are you here? I'm here to beg you to stay on the show! Our rating's going up. If you quit, we're doomed. Luo Youjun told me If I couldn't get you back, I don't have to go back, period. Get up. I am still mad. Please don't be mad. I need to go wash my hands. Actually, it wasn't easy for her, too. I heard she had to sing the same song seven times last night. It's true. Don't be angry. By the way, I think you two can make it work. Make what work? To be the best production house in China. With that... you'll become the country's best female host on TV. - Move this back a bit. - This sofa should be here. This sofa should be here. [Super Talk] I only work with those who have dreams! This sofa goes here. Move a bit to the front. Miss An, these are all the recordings of talk shows from Taiwan, America and Hong Kong. Are you not calling it a day yet? You go ahead and take a break. Welcome to today's Super Talk. I'm your host, An Ran. Our guest today is very special. - Wang Fei is good. - No, no... (Faye Wong is a Hong Kong singer/songwriter; aka "Diva of Asia") Ren Xianqi! (Richie Jen is a Taiwanese singer and actor) How would we get him? Where's your confidence? You tell Ren Xianqi's people, our next guest will be Wang Fei. Hold your horses! Where do I go to find him? Then you tell Wang Fei's people, we have Ren Xianqi before her. - Hello! - Hello! Hello! - Super Talk! - Super Talk! - Super Good! - Super Good! Super! Qi Xiao. [1996 Taipei] Cigarette? [Lin's Beef Noodles] Is your old man's health okay? He's fine. What about your business in Beijing? Did you close it? I've closed it for now. What a pity. You're really filial to your dad. Catch you later. Here. Have a bite. Nothing pleases you! What do you want? Your show is called Super Talk. Just how Super is it? We don't call our show Super for nothing. All the guests we booked are Super celebrities! Your host didn't come with any relevant educational background, did she? There's a saying that goes... "Educational background doesn't guarantee quality." Which strategist said that? Strategist? Sun Tzu has his Art of War, too. (The renowned Chinese military treatise, Art of War, was attributed to renowned Chinese military strategist, Sun Tzu) That's right! Our strategy is to unearth the true and innate goodness of our guest celebrities, so as to show their authenticity in an unscripted manner. From there, our audience will get to hear candid stories, and as they watch, they may cry or laugh, Amidst laughter and tears, they will experience facets of life. It sounds like your show is fit for those with mental issues. Leader! You're absolutely spot on! We think a good show is one which allows audiences to start watching as cool couch potatoes, but end up feeling like hot potatoes. Leaders, we ask for your permission, please greenlight our first three shows. If the rating doesn't pick up, we'll pack up. Our mission statement is, "Give me a stage and we'll give you a miracle!" Okay. Good luck with it. - Thank you! - Thank you! Our show's rating is out... We're number one, nationwide! Thank you, everyone! One at a time... [We love you forever] Thank you! [Hong Kong returns to the embrace of its motherland] [New Woman] Boss, I'll take a copy. [1997 Taipei] First, I'd like to thank the organizer for your invitation. It's like a dream come true for us to be in Taiwan. It's been a long journey for us, traveling from Beijing to Shenzhen, then to Hong Kong for a connecting flight to Taipei. [The 6th Fringe Festival; Two States Kunqu Opera Exchange Joint Performance Conference] It was a long journey that took over twenty hours, a journey that was bittersweet. We have three performances of The Peony Pavilion lined up. We hope that through exchanges via Kunqu Opera, we can encourage bilateral effusive and developmental cultural aspects through such exchanges. Thank you! "Love began unconsciously..." "It became deeper." "While love in the dream... Why should it be unreal?" (Excerpts from The Peony Pavilion play by Tang Xianzu) Next, please welcome our master artists on stage as they seek the classic in the dream. ♪ Occasionally ♪ ♪ My heart seems to be tied ♪ ♪ To the plum tree ♪ ♪ Mesmerized by the beauty in front of me ♪ Thank you! Miss An. Miss An. Hi. Autograph, please. Sure. Thanks. Miss An. I saw from the news that you were coming. Great show, by the way. I watch it every week. Isn't the show unavailable in Taipei? I asked my friends in Hong Kong to record it. Are you taking tomorrow's flight back? Yes. Tomorrow morning. We're often apart. What a treat to be together. I'm divorced. She asked for it. She wants to be an actress. The agent says if she's known to be married, it'll be hard to land jobs. What are you doing next? I often thought about... having an old house up on Yangmingshan. I'd grow roses in the small garden. I'd like to live a simple life with the one I love. I don't have to go. Are you kidding? - You're doing great in Beijing... - I don't care about it. But I do. I can't be as selfish as before. Do you understand? I'll head back now. An Ran. An Ran, get in the car! You've not changed at all! An Ran. I think of you every day. Can you please say that again? Okay? I can say it forever... I love you. [Menghuan Pond] Dear An Ran, it's so good... to see you again. I often think of that Chyi Chin's concert in 1991. How you jumped onto the chair and waved your scarf about. At that time, I thought to myself... If I ever fall in love with a girl like you, it would be very passionate. This passionate love initially belonged to me, but I regrettably let us drift apart, again and again. I know that in your eyes, I'm weak and heartless at the same time. I know that the distance between us hasn't been fair to you, and I deserve to be punished for it. I am sorry, An Ran. I do love you. I love you very, very much. But the fear that comes with love is the irony of timing. When I'm ready, you may not be anymore. I long to love you. I hope to meet up with you again. Wait for me in Beijing. I love you, Qi Xiao. Er Rou, I'll never leave you again. Don't ever leave me again. I'm in love. With who? I'm sincere. What are you doing? - Why did you turn it off? - I'm telling you about a serious matter! I'm in love. With who? That Taiwanese. Isn't he married? Divorced. The actress on TV just now is his ex-wife. Ye Yuchen? Did you steal the man from Ye Yuchen? I didn't steal. He was mine, to begin with. Good job! Congrats! That Ye Yuchen is really pretty. Shut it. [1998 Beijing] How long can you stay this time? I've sent the kid to his maternal grandparents. All the paperwork has been taken care of. I should be able to stay for a bit longer on this trip. I also plan to meet up with some old friends. I don't want to run another photography studio as before. I want to get into the restaurant business. What do you think of opening a Sichuan hotpot restaurant? I think you'll be good at whatever you do. By the way, our show's getting on prime time next week. Believe it or not, I'm going to be a rich lady! Wow. Rich lady! Rich lady, please be good to me from now on. You can change it to 'my lady.' My rich lady. Just kidding. My older brother has been released from jail. He's now looking after my dad. I've quit my work in Taipei, and gave my older brother some money. I think... I've closed a chapter for sure. Why? If you don't mind being... a mom of a 2-year old, I'd love to start over again in Beijing. We can buy a small place and a car. Every morning, I can drive Yitian to a kindergarten, then you to work. At the end of the day, I'll pick both of you up to come back home. Didn't you once say... home is where the heart is? I never forgot that. I'm sorry. I've waited long enough to tell you this. Please don't cry. If I've made you cry, that means my proposal has failed. Qi Xiao, It's not 1991 anymore! The rent has gone up, the profit margin is tight. Listen to what I proposed and get Miss An Ran to endorse it. Only then can we make it work. Don't you think you're giving me a hard time? How's this a hard time? You and Miss An Ran are about to be family., aren't you? TV personality Ye Yuchen who portrayed character Er Rou in a drama, who's well known in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, has been photographed with her family, holidaying at her hometown in the countryside. The boy appears to be around two years old. It is said that she's been married for years. According to an informant, her father-in-law is a retired history professor, and her husband is a photographer who helped her with her modeling career. Fans are saying they feel cheated with the cover-up. Ye Yuchen is not available for any comment. Hello! What're you up to this time? What am I up to? I'm the victim! My father just recovered and cannot suffer any shock, and there's also Yitian... You come over and resolve it yourself! Hello! You're back. Where are you off to? Something's come up. I have to go back to take care of it. So she's always been a member of your family? She's Yitian's mom. You can't go! Listen, be good, I'll be back soon. Will you really come back? I'm good. I'm obedient. I'm sensible. I love you. So the one to step aside is always me, right? She's had you all these years. Didn't you get divorced? I've been waiting for so long! Shouldn't it be my turn! If you leave now, that's the end of us. - Can you calm down? - No, I can't! I know you've always been disappointed in me. I don't want to make this hard for you. Good news and bad news! The good news is we're having a superstar as our guest. Bad news is that we're having Ye Yuchen. She initiated contact with us. We're the only show she's agreed to do. With her participation, our rating will definitely go through the roof. The next season of our show will be worth a lot more! Are you in or not? Xiao An, this is Miss Ye. Miss An, you look even more stunning in person! Thanks. Take a seat. Miss An. Yuchen loves your show and wants to be in it. So we made the contact. Miss Ye, are you enjoying your time in Beijing? It's so dry here, my skin's flaking off but my foundation can't even conceal it. My husband loves your show. He never misses it. Here are the pointers to go through. If there's anything unclear or that needs adjusting, we can discuss it. Excuse me. May Miss An and I be left alone to go through the script? Sure. Please step this way. Super Talk! Super Good! Hello everyone, I'm An Ran. We have the pleasure of having a popular actress from Taiwan as our guest today. Miss Ye Yuchen. She's here to share her real life story with us. Please give her a very warm welcome. Miss Ye Yuchen! Miss Ye, do you have anything to say regarding the news last week? There's nothing much to say. I'm here today to apologize to everyone. I'm sorry to let all of you down. I'm not what the press has been telling you. I'm married with a kid. My marriage was never made known because I wanted my family to have a normal life. I started my career as a model. That entailed the necessity to keep my shape. I had to stick to strict diets. My husband's always telling me there's no need to watch my weight. You look good. He never really wanted me to be in the show business. Now I can see why. After I got famous, I lost what matters in life... All I had was my busy schedules and I let things slip through. What is it that you want the most in life? To be with my loved ones. All these years... I haven't been a good wife. I haven't been a good mom. Today I'm here to take the opportunity to say something I'd like my child to know, I'm sorry. Mom loves you. All I want to do is to be a good mom. [Yuchen, we will always love you; We will always support Ye Yuchen] I'm sorry. It's too hard on you. I need a break. No problem. Take as long as you need. An Ran, the doctor said as long as you have a good rest, you'll be able to return to work in no time. Yu Feng. Thank you. Not at all. The soup's getting cold. An Ran, let me take care of you. You're back! Hello Uncle Qi. Dad, this is Xiao Nian. [2019 Taipei] She's Professor Yu's granddaughter. Go on in! Come on in! She's visiting from Beijing for a few days. I said she can stay with us. Of course! - Something smells good. - Of course! That's my dad's hotpot, the best in all of Taipei! It's not 'one of' but the best! Really? Go on in! Here, Xiao Nian, have a cup of tea. Thank you. Uncle Qi, why didn't you stay with my mom back then? [1999 Beijing] It's been more than a year, thanks for inviting me out for dinner. I used to have many friends in Beijing. Now, it feels like you're my only friend. What are friends for? How's everything with your second child? There's no second child. Baby! My boy! My boy! It's Mommy! Open up, Baby! Yitian, don't you miss mommy? Don't come here after you've been drinking! You're scaring the boy. You might want to know why the woman of your life would decide to have nothing to do with you. What did you do? What did I do? Why don't you tell me what you two have done? You tell me! It started in the winter of 1991. You bought 2 tickets for Chyi Chin's concert that day. I was supposed to go with you. But it was so cold and snowing badly. I didn't want to go at all! That was the evening... When she took my rightful place! Beijing Normal University, An Ran. I would never forget that name. So you went on her show, right? You are right! Miss An, I intend to tell the truth on your show today. Please help me. Aren't you divorced? It's just paperwork. He loves me. They don't get it, but Miss An, you should know... Don't you get it? I don't get it. The fact is I'm pregnant again. This is our second baby. This baby came at the right timing. I would like to hang on to him. Mr. Qi! I know this is precious to you. I'm giving it back to you. Why did you have it? I asked for it after the taping of the show. Miss An, your bracelet is so pretty. I had one exactly the same. Too bad... I lost it. Something I've lost is gone. But I don't know why I just can't let it go. If you like it so much, you can have it. Goodbye, Miss An. Why are you doing this? What do you gain from it? I want you to suffer! You made me suffer. I'm paying you back in manyfold! I've been with you since I was 19 years old. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be so miserable now. You two didn't consider how I feel. Why should I care about you two? Why should I? You tell me! Tell me! You never think much of my acting. Now, your not-so-great actress has beaten the talent you adore! That was my best performance ever! Too bad you weren't there to watch it. I'm not asking for your forgiveness. I just want you to know what happened. Qi Xiao, all these years after we met, I often ask myself this question. If, on that evening's concert in 1991, you were actually waiting for me, how nice would that be. It's just a pity that there's no "what if" in love. I'm getting married next month. It's a commitment I've decided to make. I don't regret our encounter. Because we met... It made me a better, stronger person. From now on, I don't want to live my life waiting for you. Good bye, Mr. Qi. ♫ My love, please take care ♫ ♫ I hope you are safe and sound ♫ ♫ Every time I yearn for you ♫ How's your mom? She is great. If you know her well you should know, she lets on nothing, not one thing. You're right. Your mom excels in whatever she does. What about your dad? Dad passed away two years ago. It was cancer. I'm sorry. It's okay. The hardest days are over. How was the hotpot? Delicious. The best in all of Taipei! I went shopping in the morning. I can make it again for dinner tonight. How about that? Great! That's great! It's so nice. This is like coming home. If you like it here, consider this your home in Taipei. Aren't you worried that I might stay forever? I can't wait! This is our backyard. One, two. My dad used to come here a lot. He could spend a whole day here, sitting on the bench where you had your photo taken. You really love your dad. He's been through so much for me. I want to be his dad in the next life. So I'd get to take care of him. Why wait till next life? You can look after him right now. Unlike me. I'll never have the chance. After my dad passed away, I moved out of the house. I didn't really talk to my mom for a long time. Why is that? Didn't I tell you I'm here to investigate something? Do you want to know what I've got? Sure. Who's this? My mom. You're going back to LA tomorrow. Have a safe journey. I'll come here again. Your dad said that this is my home in Taipei. My dad's words count! Qi Yitian! Here! Will you miss me? I will. If you miss me, please be sure to let me know. If you love me, please say it out loud. If I hurt you unintentionally, please be sure to forgive me; If we have to be apart one day, please remember the time when we were deeply in love, because it was and will be our most beautiful memories ever. [If you miss me, please be sure to let me know; If you love me, please say it out loud; If I hurt you unintentionally,] [please be sure to forgive me; If we have to be apart one day, please remember the time when we were deeply in love,] [because it was and will be our most beautiful memories ever] Yu Feng, I saw dad off. He was at peace. Don't worry. Beijing looks so different now. [Yu Feng's tomb] I hardly recognize it. However, the most surprising of all is Xiao Nian. She's matured a lot after the trip. She says she wants to go back to Beijing to study Chinese. I've agreed. Dad, I love you. Mom, did you ever regret marrying dad? Xiao An, if you didn't end up with me, I wouldn't have dragged you through this. Yu Feng, I never regretted marrying you. Xiao An. I want to go home. Sure. Let's go home. Did you not look for Xiao Nian's mom again? No. Xiao Nian's dad gave her what I couldn't have given. I was happy for them. Well... do you hate mom? No, I don't. Your mom did give me happy memories. Dad. - What is it? - For you. What is it? Take a look. [Chyi Chin, Roll Back 2019] [Chyi Chin, Roll Back 2019 Concert Ticket] Someone asked me to bring you this gift from Taipei. He said it didn't come easy! CD signed by Chyi Chin. And... this... ♪ My dream ♪ [Chyi Chin, I love you; Love you] Thanks. My first concert in Beijing was in 1991. How many of you here came to see me in 1991? Yes! - I guess you're not young then. - That's right! Right! The girl in this photo is called Xiao An. The guy who took the photo is called Qi Xiao. They met each other at my concert in 1991. After a time lapse of 28 years, they didn't end up together. Today, Mr. Qi is here. He would like to see Xiao An again. Xiao An, are you here? If you are, give us a wave so we can see you. [Chyi Chin, I love you] We say good bye for the next get-together. Our last song tonight, Somewhere Winter, is for all of you out there. I hope you'll enjoy it once more. I love you all!

She personally told me over the phone [Hero, 20 years old] that, "I've forgotten about you and moved on." He said, "It was meaningless being with me." [Poetry, 37 years old] Her mom wasn't friendly to me. [Li Ximin, 52 years old] At that time, I was self-abased but wanted to cherish myself. So I left... The marriage lasted less than three years, and we separated. [Leo, 40 years old] I intimidated him with suicide. He said, "Suit yourself if you want to die." I guess, I wasn't mature enough. The immaturity made me believe that love can be salvaged. I used to believe that we have a future together. However, suddenly, he became my pipe dream. When I was immature, she was with me. Now I've become a mature person, but she left. I devoted myself to my ex-boyfriend. But in front of my parents, I never gave in. Her grandpa was terminally ill. Before he passed away, he held my hand. ♫ Will have an excuse ♫ He said, "Please take good care of her." At that time, I thought she would probably be the only partner in my life. Deep down, we both knew that once we parted, we would never see each other again. I stared at her and started crying after the car was far away. It's been more than 30 years now. Talking about it is comforting for me now. It's a relief. If I could turn back time, I wish I could have broken up with him with a lighter heart. If I were a more mature person, I would have treated her better. If I could do it again, I would cherish the moment and spend more time with the one beside me. That would be most realistic.
