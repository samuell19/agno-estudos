I didn't press that hard! But it hurts! Where does it hurt? Here? No, no. That's it, right there! Stop making such a fuss. How can it possibly hurt? It doesn't hurt at all. It'sjust a minor thing. No booze! But I haven't been drinking. Yeah right! - Now get going. - Siu-Bo... I'm in a hurry. I gotta go. So, can I walk? Of course! Run if you will. I'm going to the park. Good! Go do a few laps in the park. I'll give you a call later. "HOUSE OF FURY-CHINESE CHIROPRACTOR" Help! Help me! Help me! 1,2,3,4,5... 6,7,8,9,10. Uncle Yue, I'm sure you said there were "dozens of Ninjas", but I counted only 10. ReaHy? Did I say dozens? I thought I said 10. But anyway... Let's first talk about the Eighteen Weapons. So, what are the Eighteen Weapons? They're the sword, the spear, the saber, the pole... Saber, spear, sword, saber, pole, sword... Right. That's ten, and I'll go over the other eight next time. Hold it. You said you went in totally unarmed, so where did the Kwan-To pole and the spear come from? Look. I'm the storyteller here! There'll be nothing left to tell next time if I explain everything now! Where was I? Right. 80 I was totally unarmed, except for my Kwan-To pole and spear. | charged straight at the enemy... What am I doing here? What time is it? 4:30. 4:30?? Already?! I came to pick up my daughter and here I am telling stories to you kids! That's it for now. You should be home doing homework at 4:30! Go home! Sweetie! Your dad's over there, Natalie. I know. That's why I'm leaving. "Answer the phone... answer the phone..." He's so annoying! Don't be like that! Your dad's really funny. He tells great stories. You're the only one who finds them funny. It's easy for you to say that because he's not your dad. I guess. Can I sleep over at your place tonight? Why? Are your parents away again? Sure. But will your brother get upset? Why would he be upset? He'd ask you to move in if he had a choice! Let's give a big hand for our dolphin stars! And also for their trainer, Nicky! Thank you for coming to Ocean World. - Later, Nicky. - Bye. You're so bad! Yeah. Let's have dinner together tomorrow night. Sure. Can we have dinner at your place? I haven't met your family yet. No. My family's really annoying. It's all right. I'll have to meet them sooner or later. Let's go out and eat instead. Hey, I was watching that! You're doing your nails while talking on the phone. How many things can you do at the same time? That's none of your business. Change it back! Jason, can you hold for a minute? What's going on? You didn't tell me Ella was here! Why do I have to tell you? Dinner time! Hi, Uncle Yue. You're here? Then join us for dinner! - Sure. - Daddy! Come. Let's eat! Come on, let's eat dinner! Hello? Hello? What about our dinner? - Bon appetite. - Bon appetite. - Ella... - Here, Ella, have some vegetables. Thanks, Uncle Yue. You're welcome. So when are your parents coming back? I have no idea. I didn't ask, and they didn't tell me. Then stay here for a few more days. In fact, you can stay here as long as you like. Why didn't I see you at the school today, sweetie? Were you there? I didn't know. I got there real early too. I called for you everywhere, but you didn't hear me. I called your cell, but it was switched off. We're not allowed to turn it on at school. Yeah. That's why I forgot to turn it back on. So your call went straight to voicemail. Wow, what a logical explanation! I can't argue with that! Eat up, eat up. Have some chicken. Thanks, big brother. You guys want to hear a joke? This is a good one. Brand new! So I was grocery shopping, and I passed by a restaurant and saw this idiot picking out fish. He kept picking and picking, until he fell into the fish tank by accident! He didn't know what to do, so he decided to swim for a lap before leaving the tank! Sorry, sorry... I'm done. What is it? It's not funny? Come on. Let's eat. Yeah, let's eat. Are you still up, darling? Let's talk for a while, OK? Did you have a good day today? I was so messed up. I went to pick up our daughter from school, but she said she missed me. I know she did it on purpose to avoid me, so I didn't make an issue out of it. It would've just made it worse. Then at dinner, I wanted to tell a joke just to make them laugh, but Nicky just went to his room without saying a word. Am I really that annoying? Is that why they all avoid me? You left us too soon, so you missed out on all this parenting stuff. It's not easy being a father. Over the years, I've done everything for them, except breast-feeding... Well, I've bitched enough for the night. Good night. Cigarettes aren't allowed in the house. This is a cigar, not a cigarette. Don't you get along with your dad? I guess we'd get along a lot better if he didn't bullshit so much. What about you and your parents? If my dad didn't have a boyfriend and my mom didn't have a girlfriend, I guess I'd be happier... Do you have a crush on me? Did Natalie tell you? She also told me you're rude, selfish, a real pain in the ass, and not worth anyone falling in love with. Other than that, I guess I'm OK. Right? Are you bored? Why? Wanna French kiss? What?! Well? Yes or no? Yeah! Time's up. Would you still have a crush on me if I changed my sex and became a man? "Natalie: It's that time of the month again. I'm in no mood for school!-E|Ia" Daddy? Can I tell you something? Sure, tell me. Jason's coming to dinner tonight. Jason? Oh, Jason! Your boyfriend! Sure! He's not my boyfriend! He's just a friend. Do you even know who Jason is? Right. Idon't know. Sorry. My mistake. I was thinking about Jackson. Who's Jackson? Fine. |'|| cook up a feast for him tonight. And promise me you won't talk nonsense. Do | always talk nonsense? You know. You're always making people listen to your stories about being some kind of a protector for secret agents! I don't want you scaring Jason off on his first visit. My dear girl! I don't care if others believe my stories or not. Iwon't even bother telling them. What's important is that you and your brother believe me. I'm telling you, all the stories I've told you are true... Enough! - All of them! - Enough! Because of you, my schoolmates think that I'm a freak. I don't want to embarrass myself in front of Jason too! Do you understand? I understand. You and Nicky used to love listening to my stories. When you couldn't sleep, you'd listen to them until you fell asleep. Since when did you stop liking them? Ever since mom died... I'm sorry. Don't be silly. Daddy wouldn't get mad at you! We're family. You never need to say you're sorry. By the way, I have a lot of patients today, so I won't be able to pick you up from school. You take care of yourself. |wi||. Bye. Sweetie! Sweetie! What now? Your lucky charm... I'm already wearing it. I'm fine. I gotta go. I have to rehearse for the school play. - You're in a play? - Yeah. Are you the lead? Yeah. Then I have to come and watch the play! - No way. - No way? My daughter is the lead! Of course I have to come see it! I'll get nervous if you're in the audience. OK then. Drive carefully. - Bye! - Bye. Can I see the rehearsal? No! Bye! Not even the rehearsal? What kind of play are you doing then? "Even though you're just a chiropractor, I still respect you all the same! Your daughter." See that, darling? Our daughter's worried I'd get upset, so she sent me a message to cheer me up, saying that she respects me. Why am I talking to you? You can't answer me back! I really don't know anything! Don't be scared, son. I'm really scared! Don't be... Maybe they'll tell me what I need to know. You have 10 seconds to make your decision. Kill them. Kill them! No! I'll tell you! Thank you. And as I promised, you may go now. Damn! Can't you be more gentle?! It really hurts, old man! You should've thought of it when you're on the skateboard! I thought you kids were used to this. Just hang on. You've dislocated your arm. I'll put yourjoint back into position now, but you'll need about 10 days of medication. That long?! You're ripping me off! What did you say?! I'm ripping you off?? OK, no problem! Hello! Can I help you? I can understand Chinese. That makes it so much easier then! Sir, I'll be honest. I'm afraid your injuries are very serious. It'll take more than just medication and a few sessions. Do you understand? I understand. But I'm not here to see the doctor. I'm here to find someone. His name is Tai Chi-Lung. I'm sorry, but there's no one by that name here. Nelson. Sit over there. Okay, daddy. Twelve years ago, a group of separatist terrorists bombed a hotel full of American tourists in the Philippines. This was in retaliation against the United States for assisting the Filipino government in suppressing the terrorists. After the bombing, the American government authorized a series of covert operations to liquidate those responsible. My job was to assassinate the terrorist group's liaison in Hong Kong, a Filipino expatriate by the name of Fernandez. What I didn't know was that the British counter-intelligence in charge of Hong Kong at the time sent one of their agents after me. In the pandemonium that followed, my upper vertebrae was severed, and I was paralyzed from the neck down, having movement only in a few fingers. After years of searching, I finally found the name of the agent who did this. His name is Tai Chi-Lung! When I tried to track him down, I found out that Tai had already retired from intelligence work, and was given a new identity by the Section responsible for protecting former agents. And who was it who gave him this new identity? It was you... Yue Siu-Bo! My dear sir. Do you know how many Yue Siu-Bos you'll find by flipping through the Hong Kong phone book? I'm not sure if you understand what I'm saying, but I'm very sure I don't understand what YOU are saying. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I really can't help you with my present medical skills. | suggest you consult a specialist. Well, we'll meet again. Nelson. Dad! Look, this is so cool! Hey, are you good at Martial Arts? Let's go. Hi, Uncle. You must be Jason! Come on in. Have a seat. Sweetie, Jason's here! You make yourself comfortable. I'll go finish cooking. We'll be ready to eat soon. Don't just sit there! Talk to our guest! Got it. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Jason. Nicky. Dump her. What? Well, good luck to you. You're here! Yeah. This is for you. Thanks. Wow, you look great! Thank you! There's one other thing. What is it? Open it. It's so cute! Does he have a name? Not yet. Why don't you choose a name for him? How about... Piggy? Piggy? That sounds great. Piggy it is then. He gives you a pig because he wants to "pork" you. Your family sells pork? He's talking crap. Don't mind him. Dinner's ready! What's that pig doing here? It's a present from Jason. His name is Piggy. Well, he's very cute! Let's eat! Come on over. Let's eat! So, Jason, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm in the music business. The music business...That's good... Are these dishes to your liking? They're delicious. Actually, I'm very casual about "sex". You're very casual about what?? Jason meant he wasn't picky about food! Wasn't that what I just said? What did I say instead? Sorry, my Chinese pronunciation isn't all that great. It's all right, it's all right. Let's keep eating! Brother, can you pass me the chicken? Can I PASS you the chicken? What's this, poker? PASS! They're at it again, Grandma. Dump her. It's a good thing you're not picky about food! Finish the rice. Come in. Hi, Dad. Are you reading? Yup. You're still up? Don't you have to work tomorrow? Yeah. I'll be sleeping soon. Let's talk for a while. What? I gotta sleep. It won't take long. I'm sleepy! You've been slacking off on your martial arts. When it comes to kung fu, practice is a must. You know the saying: No pain, no gain. Understand? Yeah, yeah. Your sister's still young. You're her older brother, so you need to be more tolerant of her. Did you hear what I said? Yes! Your mom's been gone for a long time. If anything happens to me, what are you going to do? You'd have to take care of your sister, understand? Got it! I'm going now. Cover your shoulders! You'll be sick for a long time if you get the chills! Good night. Mr. Yue, I appreciate you have a job to do. But you're the only one who knows the whereabouts of Tai Chi-Lung. I've come to you because I have no other choice. It's my instinct that if you don't tell me where I can find this man, your life will become increasingly uncomfortable. Well, we'll meet again. "HOUSE OF FURY-CHINESE CHIROPRACTOR" Have some tea. "FIST OF FURY" Where is Tai Chi-Lung? Like | said...look him up in the phone book. Rocco. He won't talk. Bring him back. Nelson. It's getting late, honey. Why don't you go to bed? OK, Daddy. Goodnight. Goodnight. All you need to do is tell me what I want to know, and you'll be out of here. You're wasting your time. I won't tell you anything. There's no need for you to go through with this. It's Tai who should be suffering. I'm only doing my job. Then you'll have to make a choice between your professional word of honor... Or your children. Tell me where Tai Chi-Lung is. Siu-Bo? I've got a really bad headache. If only my family were like yours... Nicky? You have a phone call. Some guy named Uncle Chiu. He says it's urgent. Uncle Chiu! Have you called your father? His cell phone is turned off. What happened here? I don't know. It was like this when I came here. Maybe Siu-Bo pissed some people off so they came and wrecked the place? Dad loves to bullshit, that's all. I don't think he would've offended anyone. What's that? I don't know. Careful! Since you're not talking, we'll have to try something else. This is my friend Edward. He's brought something very special for you. What? Vitamin C? Wrong. The answer is Sodium Pentathol. First touted as truth serums in the early 20th Century. What it does is it inhibits the control of your central nervous system and induces a 'twilight' hypnotic state, and elicits a mechanical iccitation of truth. Now... Where is Tai Chi-Lung? Where is Tai Chi-Lung? Where is Tai Chi-Lung? Dad. Dad! Where is Tai Chi-Lung? Memory cards... Memory cards? Inside the lucky charms. If I find the charms, | find Tai Chi-Lung, right? Where are the lucky charms kept? Underneath your mother's bed. They'll keep you safe and sound. Searching... Ain't those charms around their necks pretty? What is this place? I don't know. Let me tell you something. Daddy's gonna be changing jobs soon. I won't be protecting the governor anymore. I'll be protecting special agents. What are special agents? Special agents... special agents are agents who are very special! They do all the dirty work for other people. Once I'm in my newjob, I won't have much time to take you to the beach anymore. You'll understand, right? The best way to protect you is by teaching you how to protect yourselves! "The movement must be gentle and swift, soft and continuous. Use your breathing to summon your chi. Draw your spirit within so that there is continuity and evenness..." Don't you get along with your dad? I guess we'd get along a lot better if he didn't bullshit so much. Your sister's still young. You're her older brother, so you need to be more tolerant of her. Your mom's been gone for a long time. If anything happens to me, what are you going to do? If I'm really not around, then you'd have to take care of your sister, understand? Where are you going?? Princess! Princess! Listen to me! I'm handsome and I'm rich, and what's more, I love you. Marry me, Princess! Princess! I'm poor and I'm not handsome, but I can cook curry. Marry me! You're both good men. I really don't know who to choose! How much longer? It's almost over, Mr. Principal. For the sake of my happiness and my future, marry me! Princess, I can cook red, yellow and green curry! Do you really need to choose between us? Prince Muhammed. There's nothing I detest more than curry. However, I hate handsome guys even more. Therefore, Prince Muhammed, I choose you. Heavens! Guards! Arrest them! Now that's more like it! Ella, what is it? It's your sister...She's in trouble... Sir, this scene is actually not part of the play. Please leave the hall by exiting to your right. Why? This is nothing! Don't hurt my princess!! Come on! What is it? Just drive, Jason! My sister left these clothes here. Put them on. Is there anything I can help? To be honest, I don't know what to do myself. Do you know who's after Natalie? If my dad's stories are true after all, then I think it has to do with him protecting former secret agents. Then, do you believe him? Ididn't before, but now...| don't know... Brother, look! I found this inside. No wonder they tried to snatch my lucky charm! Do you have a computer? Yes. Loading... PLEASE INSERT DISK TWO. You need the other memory card to open the file. You're on your own, sis. Bitch! Brother! Are you all right? Let's go. You got it? Who are you? If I am correct, you must be Nicky. Did you take my father? Seems like you are a good fighter, just like your father. What do you want? You bastard! Let our daddy go now! Listen good. If you and your sister don't turn over the memory cards, your father will die. You do that and I'll destroy them! Slight change of plan. The memory cards you have contain detailed information of a retired spy that I am looking for. His name is Tai Chi-Lung. You bring him to me, and your father's life will be spared. Fine, I'll do it. But first you have to let me hear my father's voice. You're now on speaker phone with your children. Nicky... Hello? Dad? Run, both of you!! Excuse me, he is not feeling well at the moment. You have one day to bring Tai Chi-Lung to me. Try anything funny and your father will be dead. Keep the phone on. I will be in contact with you. - Hello? Hello! - What did he say? We only have one day. We have to find this Tai Chi-Lung. "USER VOICE RECOGNITION REQUIRED" This file is encrypted. What does that mean? It means we need Uncle Yue's voiceprint. Only his voice can open this file. I have his voice on my cell phone! "Answer the phone... Answer the phone..." This might help. Let me try it. How long will it take? We don't have much time. It'll take a few hours. I'll do my best. Thanks. Hey buddy! How about a bottle of beer? That's not how you do it! Are you sure that's the right way? Of course. I learned first aid in school. Thanks. For what? For saving me earlier. Otherwise, Iwouldn't have known that you cared about me. Of course, my bandaging skills aren't... as good as dad's. Dad wanted to watch the rehearsal today. Iwouldn't let him. Actually, we were both wrong about him. He's been telling the truth all along. TRANSFER IN PROGRESS Sorry, Mister. But you can't leave. "Yue Siu-Bo" Well? You cracked it?! Yup, Ijust did it. Brother! The file's open! Well? ACCESS GRANTED Tai Chi-Lung Uncle Chiu?! You guys know him? Uncle Chiu is Daddy's friend. Daddy treats his injuries all the time. He was a special agent too? There's no time. We have to find him now. |'|| drive you. Don't forget the memory cards. - What are you doing?? - Jason, open the door!! Sorry, but I can't let you go find Uncle Chiu. Actually, I'm just like your father. I'm also a protector of the retired agents. The agency thought that your father is getting old, and he might not be able to handle things on his own, so they assigned me to be his secret backup. Your father knew the risks the day he took the job. I want you to understand that it's part of our duty to sacrifice ourselves. Now that Uncle Chiu is in danger, it is my duty to protect him. Natalie... I'm sorry. But...p|ease believe me... my feelings for you were real. You jerk! You wanted to be with me because of yourjob! - Heyll - Open the door! I want to show you something. See? This hand is empty. Now watch this hand. This is for you. Sis! Siu-Mun. Look at you! You're so messy! That's too much butter! But it tastes good! We have to eat healthy nowadays. All this butter will give you high cholesterol! You're just being stingy, Grandpa! What would you like, sir? - Where's your boss? - Hold on. Boss? Someone's here to see you. - He's looking for you. - OK. How are you? You looking for me? Tai Chi-Lung. Don't worry. I'm here to protect you. Your cover's blown. You have to leave immediately. Siu-Bo...? Then...How much time do I have? None. We have to go now. - Just a minute. - Uncle Chiu! I'll be right back. Little girl, where did Uncle Chiu go? You'll never catch him. What the FUCK!! Don't run anymore, Uncle Chiu. There are people out there after you. I can't guarantee your safety if you keep running. You can save your breath. I don't trust anybody except Siu-Bo. They've already got Siu-Bo. The people who took him are after you. Whether you believe me or not, my duty is to get you away from here. I'm old. I don't want to go anywhere. Then forgive me. - Uncle Chiu! - Uncle Chiu! Has anyone here seen Uncle Chiu? I haven't. He went that way. My food stall and my granddaughter are my life. Even if you are who you say you are, I still won't go with you. Uncle Chiu! Uncle Chiu, someone's taken Dad! You're the only one who can save him. Please come with us. I'm not going with you. You want to save Siu-Bo, and I admire you for that, but my food stall and Siu-Mun are all l have. I want to see my granddaughter grow up. How can I bear to leave her now? I don't want to die just yet. Sorry. Uncle Chiu, I can't just do nothing while my dad's in danger! Please get up. The man who took dad isn't even after him. He's after you, Uncle Chiu. Even if you can get away this time, he'll still keep coming after you, and they'll take your granddaughter hostage to make you show yourself. Instead of hiding like this and constantly worrying about your family, why don't you stand up to them and solve this matter once and for all? Whether it's for my father or for yourself, help us, please. Please, Uncle Chiu! I was almost killed on a mission many years ago. It was Siu-Bo who saved my life. Thanks to him, I was able to live happily for so long. I opened my food stall, and witnessed the birth of my granddaughter Siu-Mun. Day by day, I watched her grow up. | feel I've been very lucky. All right. I'll help you. Now get up. - Thank you, Uncle Chiu! - Thank you, Uncle Chiu! Nicky! We're on different paths. I have nothing to say to you. Don't worry. I'll bring Uncle Chiu back, even if I have to give up my life! Do you have him? I have Tai Chi-Lung. Bring him to the Sai Kung pier. Somebody will be there to meet you. Let me talk to my father first! Be patient. You'll see him shortly. And let me remind you. If I sense anything remotely inappropriate, for example... The cops... He will be the best little snack your dolphins have ever tasted! You must be Nicky. Natalie. It's nice to finally meet you. Where's my father? Where's Tai Chi-Lung? He won't appear until we see our father first. Don't be stupid. You're wasting time. Your father is struggling to get oxygen into his lungs. He has eight minutes left. I'll ask you again. Where's Tai Chi-Lung? I'm right here. Tai Chi-Lung, do you remember me? I may be old now, but my memory's still very good. I'm the one you want. Let them go. You don't come into my den and tell me what to do! For twelve years, | sat paralyzed in the jail cell. I lost my wife and the most precious time with my son because of you! How dare you give me orders?! I'll take responsibility. Nicky. Get your father and your sister out of here now. I swore I wouldn't leave you behind, Uncle Chiu. Listen to me. There's no need to sacrifice yourselves. Frankly speaking, none of you will be going anywhere. You go save Dad. I'll take care of Rocco. Kill them all!! Get that old man! Stop! Don't kill him. I want him to suffer, like I've suffered. Uncle Chiu! I'm fine. Go hide yourself! Forget it. Even steel won't break that glass! DadH Wake up, Dad! Don't go to sleep! Wake up! Don't go to sleep! Don't sleep! Dad! Don't sleep! "The movement must be gentle and swift, soft and continuous. Use your breathing to summon chi. Draw your spirit within, so that there is continuity and evenness. To ascend, banish all notion of descent and sever it at its very roots." Get it? You don't get it? It means you make a Phoenix Fist and hit it with all you've got. Hit the spot right in the center until it breaks. How dare you hit me, huh?! Just kill me!! Don't you touch my daddy! COME ON!! - Dad! Dadll - Siu Bo! How are you? - You stupid kid! - Breathe this in first. This is a fire extinguisher, you idiot! Breathe in first. Do I look like I need oxygen?? You look like YOU need oxygen more! - Yeah. - Should I call... Don't get mad, Dad. Should I call an ambulance for you? Sure, sure. If you really care about me so much, then give me a few hundred bucks! - Yeah yeah. - Let's go. You weren't here when I needed you, and now that I'm fine, you show up! Didn't you see how cool I was just now? It was me against more than a hundred! I kicked their ass real good! A punch to the left, then a kick to the right and vice versa! Sure, sure. Now breathe in some more. I need to rest. We'll rest when we get home! Let's go!! But I'm panting... Well, I think our parenting problems are over, darling. Both our kids have turned out fine. On Father's Day, they even took me out for dim sum! Nicky even gave me a red packet with money and told me to find myself a woman quick. I understand. Our kids are all grown up. They have their own world now. They won't have much time to spend with their old man, right? Mei-Li, I miss you so much. - Uncle. - Come in. My daughter's still mad at you, but she never stays mad for long. Just say some nice things to her and everything will be fine. She's a real softie at heart! Be nice to her, but don't shoot your mouth off. You know what to do. OK. Thanks, Uncle Yue. Come in. Why are you here? We've already broken up. Can you give me one more chance? The days that we spent together were the happiest days of my life. I know you'll never forgive me no matter what I say. Therefore, |'|| respect your decision. Even though we're no longer together, I still wish you all the best. I hope you'll find someone who loves you even more than I do. What? You can't just give up like that! I'm a girl! You have to at least make an effort! What do you mean? Do you mean we're still together? What do you think? We are, right? Thank you. I was so worried you wouldn't want me anymore. That would've served you right! Come on, come on. So...they've made up. Are you bored? Yeah! Wanna French kiss? Surell Close the door. - Time's up! - What?? Your game has really improved a lot lately. What is this, a massacre? Can't you even let me take a pawn? You're in the same boat now. I guess that makes you family. Pawns are human beings too. They're also worth protecting. By the way, will you still keep on protecting us old farts? Dream on! Not anymore. I'm going to enjoy family life. Family is very important. Check! Check? I'll just move out of check. And I'll check again!
