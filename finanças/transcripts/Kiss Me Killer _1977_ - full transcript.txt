- Good evening boys. - Hi Paul. I've just come from the Harbour. The ship has just docked. The stuff is in a napkin as usual. Jules will take care of the watchman at six o'clock. Colonel Ferry's drive will come to collect. It's in the captain's cabin. I know about it because Moroni and I used to work for the Colonel. By the way I have a buyer for a million bucks. Not bad is it? Moroni and I can't show ourselves. You do the job, Carter. At five minutes to six you go on board to see the Captain. The password is- "the sun shines in Manacoa". The Captain will then give you the stuff. After leaving you wait for the driver and put him out. You know how. Then off with the car. If all goes well we'll meet at the parking lot. But if something goes wrong, shoot. Now repeat what I've told you. I don't want any surprises. Ok. I'll get on to the cargo. Go to the Captain. The password to give him is "the sun shines in Manacoa". He gives me the stuff. I put the driver to sleep and bring him to the parking lot. - And you, Jules? - For me it's very simple, I'll take care of the watchman and quietly go back to the car. Perfect. And you, Carlo? Me? I leisurely smoke a cigarette while the others are at work. But if there are complications, Tony will come and help. - Tony? - Yes, my shooter. - It all seems clear. Agreed? - Yes, yes, very clear. We'll meet at the park. - Hello, Captain. - Good day. The sun shines in Manacoa. - And who are you? - Colonel Ferry's new driver. There's been a hitch. The password's been changed. Things are getting bad. Let's run! Hurry! There he is. Let's go. - What happened? - Tell you later. Let's go. - You go with him, Jules. - Alright. Listen here, we'll all meet at Theodore's, understand? OK. Got it. Don't you know any other songs Freddy? I know that you composed it for your wife and you like it very much. But to me, if you hear it too many times it gets to be a bit boring. Sorry, it's a habit. Listen, do you realize that we finally made it? I would form a new quartet. A pianist, a drummer, probably the bass, and me as the trumpet. As in the old days. But with class. If you'd stop whistling you'd know we've arrived. Here they are. Hello. - Everything ok? - Yeah ok. - Have a seat. Where's Freddy? - Out there. You got out of that alright didn't you now? What the devil are you doing? What's going on? - Didn't Freddy come with you? - No. Where is he? Lida, some swine have betrayed us. Things didn't go as planned. And now? The police were waiting for us. - They started to shoot. - And Freddy? Lida, your husband Fred... What is it? - He's dead. - Dead...? It isn't true! It isn't true! Freddy! We have to leave this place immediately. Don't worry, I won't leave you on your own. Paul! Hello there, how are you? This is Rita, Pepe... - Hey! - Hello. and Koo Koo Man, a real guru. - Shall we go to the beach? - Oh yes, OK. All is about to end. Time will stop. The cataclysm is nearing! Is your friend always so cheerful? You mustn't take him seriously. You have the gift to discover exotic birds. Ah, yes. Well, have you enjoyed yourself? I wouldn't say enjoyed. Last night we went to a nightclub. You know they played the song that Freddy composed for me. - Who was it that played it? - The nightclub band. - Anyone you knew? - No. What I found strange is that the pianist came over to talk to me. What did he say to you? He asked me if I liked the melody... of that old blues number that Freddy dedicated to me. It must have been a pretext... to accost you. No I don't think so. It must have been another one. Someone must have asked him to play it. Then that's the reason you left the club early. I don't know... Perhaps. Lida, come and have a dip! Yes! I'm coming! There's no reason to be preoccupied. The only important thing is that we're together, and that I love you. Yes, and I love you too. Oh darling... What's the matter? I was wrong, I shouldn't have listened to you. What? I shouldn't have done what you asked me to. What do you mean? Come on, don't play dumb. Me? But what are you saying? Didn't you ask me to play that blues for that woman? And so? - Do you know who she is? - No. Well I'll tell you then. She's a certain Lida Radeck, the wife of the richest man in the place... a bloody son-of-a-bitch. I didn't see anything wrong, it's a song like any other. Don't you think? How you simplify things. Come on, forgive your little Moira. After all it was only a joke. And you get mad at so little? Go away. It isn't the moment. Tell me, who's been telling you these stories? It was Polo, a guy who knows everything. And so you immediately thought it was a trick, did you? You're not scared? Just say that again and I'll kick you. Ah you might. From what I gather, Radeck, that woman's husband, is some boss in the underworld that I don't want to cross. I'm only a musician. And tell those that pay you... that I have no intentions to finish up at the bottom of the sea. Yes? Hello? Yes? Oh it's you, Craig. Yes. Radeck in person. Listen, tomorrow there's the auction sale of our boats at Southampton, yes. I want you to go. I want all three of them. Did you get me right? Yes I've had information. Pay any price needed. There's a cargo, the Sunset Boy that interests me. It has a load of mahogany and ebony. Take care of things and keep me informed. Good bye. Yes? Hello, Radeck? This is Moroni. No no, I didn't fall out of bed. Listen Radeck, I'm phoning you because I'm rather worried. No. No. The fact is that last night something very strange happened. I have a new girlfriend who is a strip tease. She's got a fantastic body, but very little brains. Well anyway last night while I was at the club she said some very odd things. At first... she talked casually and then she started to ask questions about a certain Foug?re and a certain Carter, whom she claims to know. I don't know. Then she talked about a musician, a friend of Carter. - Oh, and who would that be? - She didn't say the name. She seemed to say it was a musician. Seems he's here. I bet he's the same one that spoke to Lida the other night after the band played that blues composed by Carter. What the devil can that mean? - I'd very much like to know. - We've got to do something. We can't run any risks. There's only one thing to do, we must find our man and make sure he'll never talk, understand what I mean? Ok, I'll take care of it. Yes, that's a good idea. One of these nights I'll come by the Flamingo so you can introduce her to me. - OK? - OK, see you soon. Have you had bad news? No, no, all is well. It was Moroni. I have an appointment with him at the club. We have to arrange some details. You seem to be in a strange mood tonight. Tell me, what details. We have to talk about a certain Moira. A strip-tease girl. She's apparently very sexy. Moroni wants to introduce her to me. How generous this Moroni is. And what do you expect to achieve with a girl like that? I could bring her here if you want me to. No, not tonight. It would be better if you tried her out first and then if she's really OK you can introduce her to me. Hey mister, mister! Can I carry your bag for you? It won't cost you very much. - Can't you see? Got a lot of dough! - Man, you're really elegant. - Get out of the way. - Hey real tweed, made in England. Say, you wouldn't be looking for trouble? You're barking up the wrong tree! - What is all this nonsense? - Go on! - Stop quarrelling, he's our man! - Who's quarrelling? I tell ya, he's our man! Then perhaps he can tell us that the sun shines in Manacoa. - Are you going to the Hotel Paris? - That is where he's going. Maybe he's the boss. He's eyeing us too insistently. What do you think? I don't like those types. I don't trust those kind of faces. - Do you know them? - Never seen 'em. I saw them arrive around eleven. Looks as if they're watching us. Can't be, you're imagining things. But what are you doing, you should be on stage now. Yeah, but I must get ready. - Beautiful dress you've got. - Oh don't poke fun, and give me a hand. With pleasure. Did you see those guys at the bar? They were eating you with their eyes. That's nothing new to me. Yes, but somehow they looked different. I've the impression they wanted something else specific. - Oh it's cold! - Maybe you're right. No! Something else! And maybe they're only pigs. Look here, I'm talking seriously. They don't look like normal clients. They look like gangsters or maybe cops. Spies or something. Oh you go to the cinema too much my dear. Will you excuse me? I hope I don't disturb? Don't talk rubbish. If I'm intruding I can wait outside. Now that you're here you can stay. Get lost. They're waiting for you on stage. I've come to warn you. The boss wants to see you tonight. Oh yeah, what does he want? Make a guess... It's quite evident that if the boss invites a girl it wouldn't be to play cards or dominoes but to go to bed with her, my dear. If he wants to go to bed with me... he's gonna have to tell me himself, not you, lover boy. Don't be stuck up. Be nice to him. Ok, if it's really necessary. For you, you know, I can't refuse anything. It's you? Where you going, sweetie pie? I'm going home. All alone, so late at night? Well, why don't you offer to accompany me? Aren't you afraid of me? This is a surprise. I never thought you'd be interested in me. Why do you say that? You know I like you. You excite me. You don't seem to waste any time. Anyway... we're good friends now. Alright, but you're still the boss and I should respect you as such. Better forget about it now. Don't talk nonsense. At least for the next half an hour. Only half an hour. I must say, some men get it over with rather quickly. It doesn't mean they're un-well-endowed, I'm sure you're well hung. This reminds me of someone. Maybe you know him. Fred Carter. He was always seen with a friend, a certain Foug?re. Seems they've been seen around here. Never heard of them. Now let's stop talking. And it's signed Freddy Carter. I remember him. He was a small-time composer. Thinking about that, wasn't he involved in dope smuggling or pushing? Yeah, and he was taken care of. But dead men don't write letters you know. It's probably another Carter. Still this one also talks about dope smuggling. There are too many coincidences. Unless this one is in possession of information on the activities of Foug?re and that he thinks of blackmailing him or procuring him a heart attack. Right, what could it be? Some kind of revenge. A settling of accounts. Yes. Maybe because he got to know Foug?re and Radeck are one and the same person. The fact is we know very little about this man Radeck. We know that he's been here about a year and that he has tons of money. And that he's also buying out this town. And that his wife's called Lida. I'm curious to know what compelled Radeck to settle in such an out-of-the-way place. But I'm sure he must have had very good reasons, no doubt about it. And it's possible that Foug?re double-crossed his companions, and got rid of the more dangerous witnesses after accumulating a fortune. Then he disappeared from the scene, hoping everyone would forget about him. I think that I shall have to go on a trip. But Inspector, where to? I'll go and pay a visit to the Spanish police. I have the intention of consulting their archives. Hello? Oh it's you, Carlo. - I've been with her all night. - Sure, of course. - Listen... It seems to me that this one knows too much. I think she's playing dumb, but she's quite bright. It's necessary we get to know who she is and who she works for. - Sure. - I'll be at the Flamingo. - See you. - So long. Oh you're here. By the way I had a phone call from Moroni. He again talked to me about that girl. I want to go see her tonight at the Flamingo Club and meet her. You amuse me. - Hello my little bunny. - Good evening honey child. Private reservation mister. This little angel belongs to the three of us and you're too many. Oh if she's good enough for three she'll be good enough for four. Share and share alike but not to that extent. Say, you shouldn't be so exclusive and single-minded you know. Hey, think of all the members of the community of which I also belong. What about packing up and going home now? That's ok by me. Yes, OK. Gin and tonic please. - And peanuts. - Certainly. Listen... There's a friend of mine who wants to be introduced to you. His name is Radeck. He wants to know if you'd have a drink with him. It's an idea, why not? Millionaires aren't all like that, you know. He appreciates your number very much. He thinks you're very sexy. He wants you to go over to his table and have a drink with him. - Ah, they're all alike. - Oh no he's different. You'll see. He pays more? With diamonds. - Let's go. - I'm ready. Moira, I want you to meet Mr. Radeck. - Charmed. - I am delighted. I found your number very delicious and exciting would you please sit down and have a drink with me? Yes, with pleasure. Whiskey, champagne or daiquiri? No, I prefer something else. After my number I usually like something cold. It quenches my thirst. I didn't know you performed a number here in the cabaret, otherwise I would have come every night to admire you. It would have been well worth it. I think you're much too kind. And I appreciate it even though I know you're flattering me... in a charming way. You're much too modest. You know very well I... - Rather nice, your costume. - Gratified. It doesn't show too much, but it makes you understand that I'm naked underneath. To us. To your health. You are sitting at a table of one of the most important men of the place. A self-made man. He didn't own a penny. Now he has one of the biggest fortunes you can find. He's a traveller, although he doesn't look like one. He knows everybody. And maybe even your own friends. Oh, excuse me a moment. I'm searching for two friends who have vanished into thin air. I wonder if you know them. It might well be. Their names are Carter and Foug?re. Mean anything to you? Foug?re? No. Not at all. But I seem to remember a certain Carter. Let's see, what was his first name? Freddy. Yes, Freddy. So then he's here, he's here! No. When was the last time you saw him? Must be about a year ago, at Torremolinos, in Spain. Then it isn't the same person. No. The man I'm talking about died two years ago. Yes, now I remember. He died exactly two years ago. Mr. Radeck, are you sure he's dead? Yes... Yes, without any doubt. And if the man I'm looking for was the son of Carter? He didn't have children. What are you... exactly looking for? Me, nothing? And you? What am I looking for? I really would like to talk to you in a quieter place. This really means you want to make love to me. I admire your open-mindedness. I'd like to propose a deal to you. Seriously? Let's go to my place. No, not tonight. But I promise that we'll meet soon. Very well. I'm always ready to talk business with you. She is stupid. Let us say she's a cheap class whore. But she's very cunning. Of one thing I'm quite sure is she's acting some kind of a game. What does she drive at, Chief? I believe that her game is to ask questions, to stir up the waters. But I'm sure she doesn't know anything. - And if she's a police spy? - It could very well be so, although I find it a bit strange but with whores, who knows. We must find out where she comes from? That's easy to say. Listen, I have an idea. I'll make a phone call to Colonel Ferry. Just let him hear the crackling of a few notes. And nowadays the police are using young girls to do their work. It's incredible. You know you can't always find a Mata Hari. Hello. Colonel Ferry? Are you keeping well dear fellow? Oh... I understand. Oh, by the way, I have some very good news for you. We kept a share on that deal of Roca Blanca for you. Oh, the usual thing. See you soon dear friend. Bloody old fool. It's just as we suspected. Cops are snooping. So what? There's no need to get worried. The girl could easily... drown in the bay... Anything could happen to her. No, the police will be on our backs immediately, I'm sure of it. Just let me take care of everything. I've always been up to expectations. Could you by any chance tell me where I can find Mr. Mario Cumacho? Sure, you'll find him in the third house after the steps. Hey Freddy! Good to see ya. How are ya? What have you been up to, tell me. Oh, so-so. Well then, did you go to the Flamingo? Yes we went there a couple of times. I saw the little chick. She's quite fun to talk about let me tell you. She does a number that's sensational. She could be a statue. Never seen such a smasher. Well then I shall have to pay her a little visit. Tell me something, do you and your friends know a certain Radeck? That no good son-of-a-bitch? How do you know him? Do you know him personally? Everybody knows him. He landed in this place about two years ago. All that you see belongs to him. He's bought all the boats. All the fishermen are forced to work for him, they have no options and he exploits them. He sucks their blood. And in business it's just the same. He's the absolute boss. Why doesn't somebody do something about it? That's easy to say but they're only a bunch of poor wretches. They haven't got the courage to face up to him, and you in their place would do exactly the same. Yes. I understand. - Did you know him? - Yes. Well in that case aren't you afraid of him? Tell me. Don't you bet on it. Hey sweetheart! Get some drinks organized, we're coming. You know, this is my favourite corner. I like this little Harbour, I often come here to relax. I watch the fishing boats go out to sea. I watch the seagulls fly around. Do you like seagulls? Why did you bring me here? To tell you all about my secrets before making you a proposal. Go on, I'm listening. Tell me your proposal. You've made me curious. I'm all ears. On Wednesday I must leave. I must go to South America. South America? Oh how I envy you. For a long time I've wanted to go there. But why do you talk to me about these things? I would like you to come with me. - And your wife? - Don't worry about her. She's not jealous, she's broad-minded. She enjoys it when I have fun and relax. Come, I want you to meet her. Come on. But where is your wife? Hello. You wanted to know where my wife was. Well, here she is to satisfy you. - She's quite a bombshell, eh? - Beautiful. But where have you been all this time? To change clothes. The West will be annihilated. Horizontal parallel line demonstrate the collapse of the perverted civilization. Only the great Master of Hades knows the way to save humanity from destruction. - That's quite enough for today. - Koula d?. - How about making a move? - Ok. Koula d?. Koula d?. Koula d?, okinowa kala m?nou. Where are we going? What's happened to you? Nothing. There's nothing between us. You know it too. Nothing good, nothing bad. No, it isn't true. As of late you know, I've been thinking often about our happiness. I have too. We've been happy together. But slowly, slowly the flame died without our realizing it. And now you can't remember you have a woman near you. Now, we don't make love any more unless there are other reasons. - We are married. - Married? Officially yes, perhaps. That's all. Let's go. I'll drive. - I'm going to bed now. - Happy dreams. Hello sir. A while ago somebody brought this letter for you. - Thank you. - Is there anything else, sir? - No, you can go. - Thank you. "Dear Foug?re alias Radeck. Record: 1954 Smuggling of foodstuffs and medicine 1957 Trafficking of arms 1973 Robbery and dope pushing You wanted to kill me but I am alive. I expect you Tuesday at the old mill at midnight. Freddy Carter." To Lida, my wife, my lover, my friend. Freddy. What's this music? Lida, I've received a letter. It's incredible. It was Freddy who wrote it. Your ex-husband. He's alive. Don't worry, I don't want to do you any harm. I'm not dangerous. What do you want from me? I like you. I desire you. Sounds like a new tune. I suppose you're a client of the Flamingo Club. Yeah, that's right. I've seen your number. I must warn you I'm very demanding. That's OK by me, I'm well equipped. There's no reason whatever why we shouldn't get on well together. I need you. I want you. Come with me then. Tell me something, what do you do in life? Odds and ends. - Have you been here very long? - No. - Have you got friends here? - Yeah. Would you get me a cigarette, please? You don't unbutton very much, do you? No. - Are they American? - No, are they too strong? I don't like smoking. That so? Then why do you smoke? Like that. No reason at all. I'm becoming curious about you. Oh, and why? Although you're with me, you think about other things. No, I think of you. And to be honest, to be honest... - I'm curious about you. - Oh? Are you surprised? I don't think you're interested in love or money. What... is it you want to know? But it was you who came looking for me, not me for you. No. You only accepted my company because you hoped you could make me talk. But let's change the subject. Agreed? But what are we supposed to talk about? Of love. Dear Inspector Fernandez, as agreed I'm sending you my monthly report which I believe rather interesting. I've made the acquaintance of a certain Radeck, the big boss around here and met his wife too... a remarkable woman next to whom Radeck looks a bit impotent. Could he be the man you're looking for? Radeck in a short time has become the owner of everything and everybody as it seems. There's also one of his associates, on who I keep a watchful eye. Please send further instructions and money as I'm running short. Strip-teasing doesn't pay very much and I'm getting fed up with it. Yours devoted as ever, Moira Ray. Lida? What in the hell's going on around here? What do you want me to say? But it's mad, this playing games at this time of night. What are you up to? Someone's entered the house. Mad things happen in this place I must say. Yes, let's get out of here. We'll find other dope. Ah-bou?. Shiva occulo. I didn't feel too good in that house, let's change air. - The curse of Shiva will fall on this house. - Hey Marcel, why don't you move? Oh don't worry they can't even see him. I'm quite sure it must have been them to play a joke. Who, those vagabonds? I don't believe it. They were in the house. - No it wasn't them at all. - Who then? Only one person... knows what that music means to me and it was the same person who put the record on. You mean Carter, or am I wrong? - Yes. - But he's dead. It's believable. Only now I'm beginning to think that he escaped. It's the first time that I've seen you so nervous. We must check all hotels, all boarding places, everywhere. Do you really want to search for a dead man? Yes, of course. All our lives are at stake. Do you realize what would happen if someone from the police... should come around and look? I'm not afraid. If there are any of those... we make them disappear. Once and for all. Yes, and we'll punish the robbers too. Yes. Ok, we'll call you. Hello, Inspector. How are you? What an honour. A nice surprise. And to think that I imagined you sitting dejectedly on that chair... a sad look on your face for the handcuffs on your wrists. I would have never guessed that you were so humorous. Really. I certainly don't understand people. To what do I owe the honour? Inspector, I'm in need of your collaboration. I have a problem. It concerns a foreigner who's a little too curious. I don't know what he's up to. Maybe blackmail. You must have some secrets then. Dangerous to your safety. No, I didn't say that. I am certain that you haven't a guilty conscience. Tell me, would you like it if a complete stranger entered your house at night, like a burglar, looking everywhere in your home, searching everywhere? Would you like it? Would you be happy? - Would you accept it? - And what did he steal? He didn't steal anything. The only thing he did, he put a record player on. At full blast, waking everybody. What do you make of it? It's not normal, Inspector. Don't you agree? Do you think it could be someone who has it in for you? Could be, but not probably with me. But... with my associate. Mr. Radeck. Your burglar surely is original. Inspector... start an investigation. - Immediately. - All right. Seeing that you're asking me we'll make an immediate investigation of this Mister X and into the reasons that lead him to behave in such an irrational way. Thank you. Good bye, inspector. Wonderful, didn't I tell you you'd get him back? Yeah, oh yeah... That's our job... Goodbye. You bitch. I say she certainly knows how to dance, doesn't she? - Have a good evening. - Cheers. You waiting for someone? Maybe. Why? Some other mug? Jealous are you? I couldn't care less. If I were you I wouldn't be so trusting. How about doing a number just for me? Be very careful, eh? Will you pick me up tomorrow? I may do. I may do. Have you decided to settle in this place? I've got an idea. Let's take an apartment together. I'm rather a solitary type, my darling. What a pig you are. You only remember that I exist when you feel the need to make love to someone. But I forgive you. If you want to know the truth, I like making love too. But you could at least tell me your name. Freddy Carter. That's a good one. Three-hundred and fifty. No. See you. The kitty is mine. We'll prepare a nice couscous. I'm beginning to worry about Freddy. Why is he so late? He should already be here. - What time is it? - Oh it's long past midnight. I want to go and take a look around. Take my place, Rosa. And I'm warning you, if you lose... Where am I? Try to relax. You're safe now. My name is Rosa. Tell me, how did I get here? It was me who found you and you were in rather bad condition. And as for the other guy it wasn't his lucky day either. Oh, I forgot to introduce you people. This lovely brunette is our woman. How do you mean, "our woman"? But sure she's our woman, the woman the three of us love. Tell me what you did with Moroni's body. I put it where it belongs, on the trash heap. How do you feel now, any better? - Oh yes. - I wasn't asking you. Well after all I'm the nurse and I can answer for him, no? Well Fred tell us about it. Let's say that I'm feeling better but that I'll feel a lot better still when I've taken care of that dirty son-of-a-bitch with whom I have a rendezvous at the Old Mill. What do you mean? You shouldn't and mustn't go, you are too weak. You mind your own business and get going. Out! You listen to me. I've had enough of you all. This isn't my idea of living. I've been an idiot. I must say, she isn't all that wrong, the little doll. You're not quite fit yet. You can't always play being the hero. It's dangerous and the one up there hasn't only you to protect. Yes, I know. But I can deal with it on my own. But if I were injured in your place it wouldn't make any difference. After all friends should hang together. No, no, don't insist, I'll go. Listen, you know what we'll do to even up things a bit? We'll all three go. I thought that you probably had forgotten about me. Come, make yourself at home. Nice place you have. I'm sure you're wondering why I've come to see you, isn't that so? You know, I think I can guess. Really? Let's hear it. Because you're like all the others. More refined, more gentlemanly maybe but deep down, you're a man like all the others. The other night, Mr. Radeck, why didn't you make love to me? You say I excite you. Maybe you like my body so why? Well then, we're alone. What are you waiting for? It would take too long to explain. I don't want to bore you. You are perfectly right, If there's one thing I hate more than anything else it's to be bored to tears, so come on now. Let's talk about that project, remember? I've never believed in the stories men tell me. They're all tremendous liars. No. Not all of them. I have a project to propose, Moira. Not just now. Don't insist. I'm not in the mood for discussion. It's very important Moira. I'll pay you well. I'll pay you very well if you give me some information that I really need. I'll write out a check right away. Oh you're such a nuisance. Oh, stop it! You're not as stupid as you make out to be. Why do you say that? I'm like a small animal that needs lots of love. Moira, listen. You don't fool anybody here. You're nothing but a whore. A two-bit lousy spy. And I wanna know who you work for? I work exclusively for myself. For what reason? Blackmail? It's impossible. I'm sure you work for someone. Who is it? Oh you're nothing but a boorish lout. Your charms have no effect on me, Mr. Radeck. Come on. I know you work for Carter. Admit that it was him who told you to spy on me. How much does he pay you? I'll give you much more. I'll give you all you want. You can go and tell the one that pays you that if he thinks he can intimidate me he makes a big mistake. Nothing can scare me. And I'll soon show him. We'll soon meet. I'll wait for you on Tuesday at midnight at the old mill. Tuesday at midnight, Radeck... That is tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll settle outstanding accounts, Radeck. I will crush you like a worm. You'll end up like Moroni." What's going on? What's happening to you? I don't want to go to the rendezvous. I don't want to. Are you afraid? Those good-for-nothings. They haven't been able to unearth him. What more does he want? They've already killed Moroni. It would be better if I went away. - Where are you going? - I don't know. But far away. Haven't you realized? You wouldn't gain anything by running away. You must face up to the situation. What does he want? Does he want money? Well give it to him. Me, I don't believe it. Not after all this time. On the other hand, I must see him. We must legalize the situation. Haven't you thought about that? I only think of saving my own skin. Only that interests me now. But he doesn't want to kill you. What is he saying? Then why did he kill Moroni? Legitimate defence. Moroni attacked him. I've already told you that you don't know everything about this affair. Well it no longer matters. Because sooner or later you're going to get to know it anyway. What will I get to know? That night it was me who shot at Carter. And I missed him. I now realize my mistake. I should never have done it. Why ever did you have to do such a terrible thing? Carter and Jules were bothering me too much. Those two had got to know too many things so I considered it prudent to get rid of them at an opportune moment. But what impelled me to eliminate your husband was my deep love for you, Lida. Because I wanted to marry you. You should have told me then that you know. We could easily have found a solution. Running away won't do. He could possibly track you down. I'll accompany you to the rendezvous. I know what you're thinking. That I should cry. Insult you. But it's no longer the moment. It's all so far away. Carter for me is only a distant memory. We've been happy together, but a long time ago. Now it's you. You who are owning me now... Every hour, every minute. You're my husband. Nothing else matters now. Is that you, Carter? What does this mean? Who are you? Who are you? I'm Inspector Fenton, Criminal Agency. This is my assistant, Sergeant Peck. What are you doing here? I was supposed to meet Carter. I know that. It was he who told me. He asked me to assist. Carter? What does it feel like to see me again? I had the good fortune to be saved by the police. Yes, that's about how things went. You've been unfortunate. Now you see, Carter is on our side. On the side of the police. He works for Interpol. Are you surprised, Foug?re? I mean, Signor Radeck? We were uncomfortable witnesses. We knew far too many things. We knew all of your dirty dealings. We who for years had trusted you blindly in everything. Not only did you want to do away with us so that you could, you thought, get all for yourself, but you also wanted to take Lida. Congratulations, Fenton. You're very clever and also very fortunate. But we know that the wheel goes round. I must admit your plan was perfect. A car bursts into flames and burns and what do the police find? The body of Foug?re, burnt to a cinder. Tell me, how did you know? Who betrayed me? If you really want to know who it was, it was I who did it. I told everything I knew to the police. You! You lie! Do you want to know all the details, false Foug?re? Well one day one of the musicians recognized me. It was he who told me Freddy was still alive. Since then, whenever I've gone out, all my travels have had one aim. To find again the only man I've ever, ever loved. Don't talk like that, Lida! You know you ruined my life for me, and you must pay. Just make a move and I'll kill her. You better get out of the way, Fenton. Don't do anything foolish. Get out of... Lida, you're the only woman I've ever loved. Have you lost your mind, Moira? Let me pass! No, stay where you are! But why? What have I done to you? So you don't remember, do you? You have a short memory. Now I'm going to avenge myself. And don't try to make me feel sorry for you because it just won't work. - But listen... - Oh, shut up! You disgust me. You're shitting yourself with fear. You're nothing but a filthy worm that has always taken advantage of people. Moira, let me pass. For the love of God, Moira. Don't make a move! Try to reason. Moira, you don't have the right! Please don't. Stop or I'll shoot! I'll give you all my money, Moira.
