(mellow orchestral music) (hooves thumping) - How's the hunting up in the mountains? - Pretty good. But I don't suppose you'd call me down here to ask me a question like that, Gaston. - Victor, they've arrested your brother. - What? What did you say? - He was reported to the Mounted Police. - But he wasn't mixed up in anything. - It's not important. It's just like Sullivan. - Are you sure that it's Charles they arrested? - Yes, they locked him up in Fort Brennan. - Why don't you want to sell me your pelts? The reason stinks. Already, a lot of the traders don't want to accept my prices. - We've always worked on our own, Mr. Sullivan. Nothing to do with other trappers. - You're lying! You're all in this with a Limoux. I'll give you one last opportunity. Where is this renegade? - We don't know, Sullivan-- - You're lying! Traitors to our Majesty. Lowdown pelt robbers. You will all talk if I have to slit your throats for every one of you to confess! Where is Limoux and his family? - We don't know nothing. (slapping) - That's all, Mr. Sullivan. (mumbles) should be judged legally. - This concerns the Hudson's Bay Company. And in my capacity as commissioner, I'm within my rights. - If you want to interrogate the prisoners, then you'll have to do it more civilly. - Captain Doyle, I'm not in agreement with your methods of interrogation. - You're accused of piracy and rebellion. You all know what this can cost you. - Everyone knows we have nothing to do with it, Captain. - We've never been involved in politics. - Always the same story since they were arrested. - They're liars. Liars all of them, and we've got witnesses to their treacheries. - Why don't you present these witnesses? - Oh, if that's the way you want it. Let them come in. A necessary kind of treatment should be used with these lads, Captain. They're together with the trappers, not to sell us their pelts. - But aren't these men your employees, Mr. Sullivan? - Honest subject to the Crown, Captain. They were attacked by the band robbing pelts. Milton, tell them what happened. - We were attacked yesterday morning by surprise near the corner of Gold Creek. It was Limoux and his band. They killed almost all of us and robbed us of our pelts. - And these three men? What did they do? (ominous music) - They were with them. - You're lying. - You were with Limoux. You yourself shot me in the arm. - Enough proof for you, Captain? Shall we form a court martial? What is the military penalty for this type of crime? - Death is the penalty. (drum roll beating) - For rebellion against Her Gracious Majesty, subversion in the colony, piracy, assassination, banditry, and-- - That's a lie! - Therefore, we must and do condemn Charles DeFrois, Marcel Sardu, and Maurice Toure to be executed by the firing squad. May God have mercy on their soul. (drum roll beating) - Don't do it! They're innocent. - It's no use, Victor. - None of us can stop it. (drum roll beating) - Firing squad, attention! (guns thud) Ready! (guns cock) Load! (guns click) Aim! Fire! (firing) You'll now halt! Right face! Forward march! (drum roll beating) Eyes right! (drum roll beating) - Good lesson, yes, sir. Now they'll tend to more peaceful. (drum roll beating) - Come on, Victor. There's nothing you can do for him right now. (drum roll beating) (creaking) (mellow orchestral music) (singing in foreign language) (glasses clinking) (singing in foreign language) (men laughing) (singing in foreign language) (clapping) (mellow accordion music) - Paulette, you continue playing and circulate until I return, hm? (mellow accordion music) (footsteps approaching) You're going? Don't make any error, Victor. Whatever you try do-- - What do you think? I'm gonna sit here and do nothing? - No, I don't want them to jail you, too. What are your plans? - I'm going to join up with Limoux. - I love you, Victor. I've been waiting such a long while for the day of our wedding. - That'll have to wait. - Please. Please don't go, Victor, if I matter at all to you. Or isn't that important? - I have a duty to perform. - Of course, you have. To live for me and my precious memories. To provide for our future children. - That's enough. - I need you so, Victor. I love you so. I love you with all my heart, and I'm not willing to let myself lose you. (gun clicks) - Brothers, we all have the right to live in freedom in our country. We have the right that all should respect our laws, our language, and our religion. You already know the English. They're tough and men of cruelty. Among them exist men of oppression like James Sullivan. - Death to Sullivan. - Yes. Death for him and for those others that oppress and rob us. But we need to be more in number and much better-armed. - You tell us where to get the weapons. We'll get the rest. - We'd put an end to the arrival of pelts to the Hudson Bay Company. And now we've go to take possession of all those in this zone. - And what do we do with so many furs? - Across the frontier, they offer to exchange them, for more modern weapons, all we want. - [Lookout Man] Hey! Someone's coming. (suspenseful music) - Come on, follow me. (suspenseful music) (hooves thumping) (suspenseful music) - I've come to join you. - When we really needed you, you didn't offer us your help. - I wanted to remain neutral. Only to live in peace. - Come on! There can be no peace, not from either party. - That's why I'm here. - Only because the English killed Charles. Don't try to fool me. - I don't intend to. I want vengeance. - Only a few weeks ago, you were selling your pelts to Sullivan, at the prices he was offering. - Forget all that. Can't we start over again? - We're fighting for an ideal, not for personal motives. We want Canada to be free. - I promise to obey all your orders. - Then show me what you're worth. (birds chirping) (gun cocks, fires) (firing) (thuds, clanks) (thuds, clanks) Now let's see if you can defend yourself with this. Come on, take it. (yelling) (suspenseful music) (clanking) (suspenseful music) (clanking) (grunting) (clanking) (suspenseful music) (weapons clanking) (men laughing) (mellow music) (men laughing) Where has he gone? (grunts) (suspenseful music) (weapons clanking) (yelling) (laughing) (thuds) (laughing) Bravo. You've shown me a lesson. Go find a place among my men. You'll soon prove with action the truth of your intentions. - You're right. - (laughing) You see, he's my friend. (mellow music) - Is this what you wanted? One day, the fighting will be ended. And we can all live in peace. - No, we won't see that day, but I feel so happy beside you, Leo, even though it's difficult right now. (patriotic music) (mellow music) (horses neighing) (mellow music) - We've got to be forceful with these rebels, Captain. The whip is the only language they understand. - I'm afraid you're too hard on the trappers, Sullivan. - That's what the Hudson's Bay Company hires me for. And don't you forget that you are all here only to safeguard our interests. - Only to a certain extent. - Please, can't you discuss something other than this in my presence? - Ann, forgive me. At times, I just don't realize it. - Of course, he forgets this isn't England. - You were very unfair with my father a moment ago. - Believe me, Ann. I prefer not to talk to you like this. - Then for heaven's sake, why do you do it? - It's my duty. The whole region is in very grave danger. Incidents are happening all too frequently in the territory. If we're not very careful, we're gonna have a revolution. - Are you trying to frighten me, Captain? If so, it doesn't matter what you or anybody else says. It's impossible to believe that these half-breeds could endanger the English, nor that my father could be wrong in the way he chooses to handle them. - Well, then, I'd be quite wrong. - Yes, you could be. After all, it's only a year that you're here now, my father for 15. - Please, Ann, can't we talk of other things? - As you wish, Captain Doyle. - (chuckles) Maybe you could call me Robert. - All right, I will. - My dear Ann, in the first few days after my arrival, Canada was very difficult, and hostile with me also. I felt alone among people who were strange with a mentality quite different to mine. - But now you don't feel so lonely. - My duty absorbs me to such an extent that I forget about my loneliness. - Just for a little while, couldn't you forget your duty? (serene music) - You know far too much about my feelings, Ann. - It's just-- - But why-- - Too soon. Give me a little time, to be sure of myself. - It seems that Captain Doyle is pretty much taken with Miss Ann. - This is none of your business, Craft. - Well-- - There'll be no comments about my daughter. - Yes, Mr. Sullivan. - We need a bigger amount of pelts before crossing the frontier. - Sullivan and Doyle will try to stop it by all means. - I'll be ahead of them with a check of my own. I'm going to capture Sullivan. - He's responsible for the death of my brother. - I'll hold him for ransom, in case anything should go wrong. Doyle wouldn't think of attacking us if he knew that Sullivan's life depended on us. That way, the Bay Company would have to give in. - If they accept your conditions, will you let Sullivan go with (mumbles) arm? - Yes. And now you can choose between joining us or looking for personal vengeance. - I'll stay with you. - You will be in charge of the attack, just a few of you. That way, you can pass by unnoticed. No guns, understand? The shots might attract the attention of the sentinels at the fort. Success depends on silence. (suspenseful music) - You're lucky tonight, Johnson. - Can't complain. - Go out and see if everybody's awake. - [Man In Brown] But why so many precautions? The rebels wouldn't dare to come here. - But orders are orders. Go out and join the ones outside. Meanwhile, take a breath of fresh air. - All right. (mellow music) - Right now in London, they're out for the evening. All my friends will be wearing their prettiest dresses, and dancing with young men of the finest society in England. The nights in this country are so long and unbearable. You know, I'm beginning to wish that I had never come to this place. - You'll become accustomed to it, ma'am. When I'll become calm once more, we can go out to the countryside again. (knocking) - Who is it? - Mr. Sullivan has just left for the fort. He said I should stay with you until he returns. Is there anything you would like? - No, thank you. - Very well, if you want anything later, I'll be in the vestibule. Good night. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (splashing) (grunting) (thuds) (grunting) (splashing) - I want to give them a hand. You stay here and wait for me. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thuds) Let's go. (suspenseful music) (knocking) (suspenseful music) (knocking) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (thuds) - What is this? Dogs! Why did you kill this man? - He's Sullivan's daughter. - Where is your father? Answer me. - He has gone to the fort tonight. You'll pay for what you've done. They'll hang you for this killing. - Now what do we do? - Go and search the house. I don't trust this one. - Let's go, Gaston. - You're Limoux? - I'm Victor DeFrois. - Just a filthy renegade. - Your father murdered my brother. - You're a lying traitor. (slapping) (whimpering) - There's no one here. - We looked everywhere. - Looks like Sullivan's in luck, huh? Tell your father that Victor DeFrois will give him what's coming to him even if he runs and hides under the skirts of the Queen of England. Come on, boys, let's get out of here. - We came for a hostage. - There's no more to be done here. - We could take Sullivan's daughter. - No, this is not an affair for women. - She would be our prisoner, of course, would serve us well or even better. - That's up to you but I don't wanna get mixed up in it. Hurry it up and don't forget your weapons. (shattering) (firing) (firing) (firing) (grunting) (firing) - [Ann] No, let go of me! Let go of me. Let go! (firing) (grunting) (thuds) (firing) (firing) - Look what a fine English fish we've got. - We didn't find Sullivan, so I thought his daughter would be even better. - You'll pay for all of this dearly. You're just a band of killers and sneaking cowards. - Just like your father when he killed my brother. (grunting) - Swa, take her away from here and give her something to cover herself. Victor! - Follow me. - No, I won't go with you. If you want, you'll have to take me, witch. - You're a prisoner. Obey, or you'll be sorry you didn't. - You'll take the girl and hide her. In case the Mounties decide to attack, we'll still have our hostage. - Why should I be the one? Why can't I go with you, Limoux? - You promised to obey, no? Well, this is an order. - All right. - You'll hide in the cabin at Lake Louellana. - How will I have news of you? - You'll have to watch the mountain in front of you. A column of smoke at dawn means that everything is going all right. Then you can bring the girl back again. - And if you have bad luck? - If the smoke should come in the evening, that is, the English don't accept the pact... - In that case, what'll I do? - You'll kill her. Swear it. Swear it! By your brother's memory. - I swear. - She's frightened to death. She's weak, a coward and proud, just like all her people. Take care of her, Victor. - What are you saying? - Her father killed your brother. And now she's in your power. Eye for eye. Humiliate her. Make her yours. - That's enough, Swa. Victor knows what he has to do. - Yes. (mellow orchestral music) - There'll be a $1,000 reward for the return, dead or alive, of Leo Limoux. The same reward for information about Ann Sullivan. I hope the reward will be yours. - Don't worry, we'll be back to pick it up real soon. - Then good luck. (suspenseful music) (stone thuds) (suspenseful music) - How long do they plan to stay there? - I don't know, days, or maybe a month. - A month. And her, what's she like? - Oh, a typical English woman. - Blonde? - Yeah. - Is she pretty? - Well, she's a bit frail. - Is she prettier than I am? - Not at all. You're different. - He knew how I don't like it. - Don't worry about it. Victor loves you. - Yes, but he's a man and she's a woman. (gasping) - Come on, on your feet. - Have mercy, I just can't. - Come on. - Why not kill me right here now? - I might have to, eventually. But not right now. (mellow music) - What was that noise? - Uh, don't get scared, a wolf looking for something to eat, bad in the daytime. Don't worry about it. (suspenseful music) - We better hurry. - I can't. My leg's been hurt. - Sit down and I'll take care of it. - What are you thinking of? Turn your back. (suspenseful music) (mellow music) (thuds) - That's enough now. (mellow music) - Hey, Jake, a handkerchief. - But it's covered with perfume, ain't it? (suspenseful music) - You know what it's all about? - It appears to me like the girl liked us. - We're not letting them get away like this. - You and I pretend to follow her just now. - Sure, man. We can go around the lake. - That'd take us all night. - I have no worry. You? (laughing) - (yells) There's a body on the raft there. - Hah, look over there! A body, on the raft! (waves lapping) - What's this, Craft? - The raft we were waiting for, sir, with no pelts and Cary shot through the head. - That's the fourth one this month, Captain Doyle. Another 500 pounds worth of pelts lost and three men killed. - Are you blaming me? - This bunch of pirates have cut the river traffic and this is while you and your men do nothing at all. - I have a handful of men to look after 10,000 miles. - I only know they're stealing my pelts right under your nose. They stole my daughter and they killed my employees. - Some of the scouts are looking for their trail. - That's not enough. - It's the only thing we can do until we get reinforcements from Fort Labady. - Yes, and meanwhile what will become of Ann? (suspenseful music) (mellow music) (thuds) - Come over by the fire. Don't be frightened, I won't hurt you. - You wanna go and get the girl and nothing more? - Looks like the guy has got a gun. Maybe he won't like us. - Well, then, maybe we better wait for the right moment. - I think that's the best thing to do. - Here, eat. - I don't want food. - I don't know how long we're going to be here. Are you thinking of starving? - What does that matter to you? - Look here now, Miss Sullivan. I don't like your father, and I don't like being a jailer either. I think we better make the most of the situation. - I won't accept any food from a thief and a killer. - All right then. Eat or starve, suit yourself. - What do you plan to do with me? - When Leo returns, I suppose I'll take you back to the fort. - And if he doesn't return? - He'll return. - And if not, you're going to murder an innocent woman just like that? What a great and glorious triumph. - Keep quiet. - No! You say you're patriots and you're nothing but bandits. - Naturally, you English people think you're so superior to us Frenchmen. You think you have the right to rob and to even assassinate the Canadians. - I won't listen to this. You're making up these lies. - Here, we're all alone, Miss Sullivan. Your distinguished English blood is worth as much as mine as a half-breed. But you don't have to worry. I won't take advantage of you. (mellow music) You can sleep it. (door creaks) (slams) (mellow violin music) (serene music) (door creaks) - Hey, where are you going in such a hurry? - Thanks a lot, you saw my handkerchief. You will save me, won't you? - That's why we've come. What seems to be the matter? - Bandits captured me. My father's name is Sullivan. He's a commissioner down at Fort Brennan. Please, won't you take me away from it before that awful man comes back. - Come along with us. - You were lucky you found us. - Ann! Ann! (mellow music) - And now you gotta eat, you pretty little thing. - Yes, it's time for you to amuse us. - What do you mean by that? - [Butler] You see, you're very, very pretty, and we need company. - No, you wouldn't dare. - Come on, girl, come on. You gotta be a little bit more cooperative. - But you promised to take me to my father. - [Butler] Don't be in big hurry. - You stay here with us. (whacks) Hey! - You won't be so fast now. (thuds) (whimpers) - Come on, get up. - Get up, get up. - Be still. - Let go! - [Jake] Keep still! - [Butler] Hey, hey, hey, hey. (sobbing) - Quiet, quiet. Oh, I love these well-kept women. Mm, what a skin, just like a princess. - A little dose of your nails, too. - [Jake] Yeah, we will soon take care of those. - Why don't you take a walk and see if the other guy is around? - Why me, why not you? - You're right, we should dice for it. (laughing) An eight. She's mine. - But only just for the day. (chuckling) - All right, princess, now we'll have some fun, me and you. - Please no, I beg of you, no. - Don't be a fool. - No. Let me go, they'll kill you. - Come on, baby. No one will find us here. - Watch out! (thuds) (grunting) (grunting) (thudding) (splashing) (whacking) (grunting) (coughing) (grunting) (grunting) Come on, Butler. Go on and finish him off. Drown him. Drown him. (grunting) Give it to him, Butler. Give it to him, kill him! (grunting) Finish him off! (grunting) (heaving) (grunting) - Jake, Jacob, help me! - Don't count on me. I hope you both drown. I'll take the gold and the girl. (laughing) Hit him hard, man. He's got a head like a rock. (grunting) (water burbling) (heaving) - Victor! (firing) (melancholic music) (yelping) (splashing) (firing) (mellow music) - You behaved very stupidly. See that you don't do it again. (suspenseful music) I'm all right. - But you're wounded. (anxious music) (tense music) (ripping) (dramatic music) (festive bugles and drums music) - [Capt. Farrell] Detail, halt! Right face. Dismount. Get rest. - Reinforcements at last. Come in. - Captain Farrell reporting with reinforcements from Fort Labady. - You're welcome here, Captain and how's Colonel Thompson? - Very well, Mr. Sullivan. He sends his regards. - And his help as well. Let me introduce Captain Doyle who's in charge. - Hello, Farrell. - Pleased to meet you. - All right, Captain, explain your plan of attack. - The rebels are operating in this zone. As a bait, we'll float a raft that's been loaded with pelts and which will be manned by two of our very best men. I'll go along the shore with the second company and follow the course of the raft, until they start the attack. - And when they try to rob the skins, you'll attack the rebels, right, Captain? - Now you'll see. The rebels can get away easily by crossing this mountain the way they've done up until now. - And then? - You, Captain Farrell, will be waiting with all of your men hidden amongst these trees. And when the fugitives find themselves out in the open with no protection, then you'll open fire quickly and exterminate them. - Avery good plan. That will finish them off for good. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - I don't like this, it's too quiet. - We've got a good chance to get hold of an important shipment. - Where's the Mounted Police? - They're all at the other part of the country looking for that daughter of Sullivan's. (suspenseful music) - They ought to be here now. Prepare for the attack. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - They're coming. (suspenseful music) - Now prepare it! Now then! (suspenseful music) Everybody to the raft!

Let's get up to the top. Let everything go! (firing) (suspenseful music) (grunts) (thuds) They're coming, hurry! Come on, you, too. (firing) (grunting) (firing) Get out of here. (firing) - Leo! Leo! Leo. Leo's hurt, over her. - It's been a trap. We've got to get out of here. We'll be safe on the other side. The English can't cross the river. - Let's go, we've got to get him out of here right away. (firing) (anxious chase music) - We're done for now. - No chance of escape. - Let's go, men! - Sound the charge. (bugle music) (hooves thumping) (suspenseful music) (firing) - Come on, help me. Let's go. (firing) I've got to get down below. - You can't. - And join the others. (firing) (screaming) (grunting) (horse neighing) (firing) (bugle music) (suspenseful music) (firing) (grunts) (suspenseful music) (firing) (yelping) (suspenseful music) (horses neighing) (suspenseful music) (firing) (horses neighing) (grunting) (thuds) (firing) (suspenseful music) (firing) (horses neighing) (firing) (suspenseful music) (horse neighing) (firing) (firing) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (horse neighing) (firing) (suspenseful music) We should have died there, too. - We stay to avenge the dead. (somber music) (birds chirping) - You shouldn't have gotten up. You're still very weak. - I'm fine. Ann, just a second. Why'd you stay here? - I couldn't leave you in that condition. - Why'd you change your opinion? - Perhaps because I saw that you were decent, that you had some respect for me. But why look at each other with hatred? Why, instead of being enemies, can't we make an attempt to live in peace here? Is it possible that Canada is not large enough to shelter both the English and the Canadians? Why did you rise against us, Victor? - We're proud, and we have our dignity, too. It's impossible to treat us like simple slaves. - But you and I, what do we have to do with this insanity? Why can't we try to forget all of this fighting? Why not think of ourselves, our own lives? (dramatic music) (serene music) - You should have run away. - It's nice like this while we're together. - Ann, can't you see? Don't you know we'll have to separate? The signal will be a column of smoke from the mountains. - And then you? - Yes. I have to return with you. - But, why don't you rebel? Why did you refuse to fight? We could go far away where there's no hatred, where nothing could separate us. - It's useless, Ann. I've sworn it on my brother's memory. (soft melancholic music) (groaning) - Answer me. Where is my daughter? - I don't know anything at all. Captain Doyle won't permit this kind of treatment. - When he hears about it, you'll be whipped to the bones. - Confess now! - Please. - Where is she hidden? - She's being held by Victor DeFrois. I don't know where. But he said he would bring her back when he saw the smoke signals on the mountains at (mumbles). - And what kind of signals? - A column of smoke at sunset, that will be the signal. - I hope you are certain in what you just said. - Why have you betrayed him? Now they'll catch Victor. - It's by vengeance. Mr. Sullivan will give the order to kill his own daughter by the enemy. (groans) - I don't understand. - The signal for a return is a bonfire at dawn. And I told him to light when it's sundown. I hope the English girl would die. - Uh-huh. I thought so. I had a suspicion I couldn't trust you. So that's to be a column of smoke just before dawn, eh? (mellow music) - Now we have to return. - And I have to return to my father. - Yes, I've got to take you there. - Swa, look. - Who can be sending that signal? - It's Sullivan, I'm sure. - Victor! He'll take it as a sign and fall right in their trap. - Strange. The place looks deserted. - My father should be here waiting on me. (suspenseful music) - I don't like this. I'm gonna have a look around. Wait for me here. - There he is. Take him. (thudding) (grunting) (yelps) (thuds) (gasps) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (groaning) - Come on, my dear. - [Leo] Hang on, Victor, we're coming in. (grunting) - You idiot, you didn't do what I told you. I told you to warn the Mounted Police. - I didn't think it was necessary, sir-- - That's enough! (grunting) (clattering) (thuds) (grunting) - Pardon me, mister. - Let's go! Get the canoes! - Come on! (firing) ((thudding) - I said get in the canoes. (firing) - I'll stay with you. - Leave me alone. (firing) (grunting) (thuds) (firing) (grunting) (thuds) - Don't let them get away. - Let's shoot it out all together. (firing) Limoux is dead. Limoux has been killed. We've killed Limoux! (firing) - Limoux's dead. - I'll cover you. (firing) We better go. (sobbing) (melancholic music) (sobbing) - Leo Limoux is dead, but all of us here have to continue. (chattering) - You are fools. What is it now, more dead, more bloodshed? Why don't you admit that we can't win? - The fight goes on, and it must go on until all of our people are free. - He's right. We just can't (mumbles). We must conquer it now. (chattering) - I'll go to the United States. I'll find Louis Riel and convince him into coming back. Then we'll show the strength of the free French-Canadians. Nina. - They'll pardon you. I'll beg for mercy. We can still be happy. - Oh, this is useless, you'll never understand. - You'll end up like Leo Limoux. - Leo died bravely. - And living? Doesn't that matter to you? Don't I matter anymore? - I do what I have to, believe me. - All right, then I'll stay by your side. No more separations, please. - Wars are men's affairs. - Swa was with Limoux. - Swa is different. - But why? - You're making this parting even more difficult. Goodbye, Swa. (chattering) So long. - Good luck. - Thank you. - [Old Man] Good luck, boy, you'll need it. Take it easy. - [Victor] Good bye. (chattering) - Victor, I'm going with you. - Impossible. - Listen, I love you. And this is the way it will have to be. - But do you know what I have to do? - Yes, I'll follow you, Victor, always, everywhere. - A woman does not abandon her man. Victor is no longer yours and Leo Limoux is dead. - What do you mean by that? - You heard what I said. And the same will happen to me. - You're crazy. - No, I'm serious. But you will never live with Victor DeFrois again. In other words, he detests you. (water gently lapping) (mellow music) - They're nothing but scoundrels. - And where are they heading? - They'll cross the frontier in the pass in Clintock. - Don't waste time on idle chatter. Captain, they're getting away. - One moment! Are you telling the truth, Nina? - We were supposed to get married. - Here's your reward, take it. Let's go. - Don't forget. They have a couple of hours advantage and they're more than 70 miles of the frontier at Clintock. - No problem, we can catch immediately by going over the mountains. - You'll lead, Craft. We'll get them and I'll have my vengeance. They'll all live to regret what they've done to me. (thuds) - Captain Farrell, you'll be in charge of Fort Brennan until I return here. - You can count on me, Captain Doyle. - Mr. Sullivan, are you coming with us on this operation? - Naturally. - I want you to understand that there's a very tough journey ahead of us. - This concerns my daughter, Captain. I intend to punish the guilty man. - Nina. Swa is looking for you. She says she wants to kill you. (grandiose horn music) (ominous music) - You swine. You couldn't hold on to your man and now you betray your own race. (grunting) (banging) (clinking) (grunting) (thuds) (clattering) (grunting) (clattering) (suspenseful music) (thuds) (yelps) - Swa. Swa, promise me. Don't let them get to Victor. Promise me, Swa. - I'll get there before Sullivan and save your precious Victor. (heaves) (somber music) (hooves thumping) (suspenseful music) - [Craft] Let's move! (mumbling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Traveling together? - Yes. - I was only told to bring one horse. - Don't worry, we'll make up. - [Delivery Boy] Good luck. (suspenseful music) (hooves thudding) (suspenseful music) (hooves thudding) (suspenseful music) - We're very near now. - All right, forward! (suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (firing) - The shot came from among those trees, Captain. - Open fire at will. (firing) Charge! (suspenseful music) (firing) - Listen, gunfire. - They're coming after us. (distant firing) (yells at horse) (firing) (grunts) - You dirty savage! Let go! Let go! (grunts) (yelps) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (grunts) (thuds) - Are you-- - No, I'm all right. - She's broken her leg. We'll have to continue on foot. There is no other possibility. Come on, let's hurry. (suspenseful music) (hooves thudding) (suspenseful music) - We've got to hurry. They're escaping. - They're heading to the frontier. Forward! (groaning) - We can't make it, Victor. - No, I won't leave you. - You go along, please. (dramatic music) - There you are! (dramatic music) Halt! - What are you doing, Captain? Let's go on. - We cannot cross the frontier. - What do you mean by that? I'll cross-- - Wait, Sullivan! Look over there, patrolling Americans. (hooves thudding) - We've made it, Ann. We're safe now. - No! (dramatic music)
