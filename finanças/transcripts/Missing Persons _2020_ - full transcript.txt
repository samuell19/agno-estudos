But I hadn't told them our exact location before my phone died. See. It's completely out of battery. My phone's dead. And I don't know any of you.

We don't have time for sorrow. Now we should think about ourselves. The police told me in the call to light a fire, a big fire if possible. That can help the rescue team locate us in the darkness. Now it's getting dark. We should assign the tasks and do it together. Then we can manage to make a fire before darkness. The benchland is covered with branches. We can collect them into a pile and then find some clothes from our luggage. Where are you going? What do you want to do? The benchland is too damp and without large pieces of wood. I need to stack up some stones first and build a fire pit. Then we can light a campfire. Ziyou. You can help me build the fire pit. I don't... know... how. I... I... can help you with labor work. I'm Liu Changqing. You can call me Liu. Thanks for helping me. Ma Hongxin. Zou Zhiming. Lu Min. Li Qiao. Our bus tumbled off the mountain more than 100 meters high. We all survived it. That's a miracle. We should make good use of it. We should collect branches and clothes. It's getting dark. Don't feel sad. We've done our best. His death, just like the rest passengers, was caused by the car accident, not because we didn't help him. Your cap. Thanks. You might feel better wearing this. Hide yourself under the cap. And hide away all these depressing feelings. I understand. When I asked to transfer you here, I guaranteed to Chief Xu. Just this case. I've discussed it with Chief Xu. He agreed me staying. This is not about him. Even if he agreed, I won't. It won't help. I've tried. You can go to Beijing without any worries. After you fulfill your goal, you can come back and pick me up. No matter it takes you one year, three years, or many more, I'll be waiting for you. I'm fine now. I've tried. I won't feel sad again. Clothes. Put them down here. Are you alright? I'll collect them. You can rest by the fire pit. Li Qiao. That man called Liu Changing is pretty weird. Stay away from him. Ma Hongxin. Li Qiao. Our bus tumbled off the mountain more than 100 meters high. We all survived it. That's a miracle. We should make good use of it. Take these back. I'll collect more over there. It's almost enough. Light it. It's getting dark. Run! Get on the rock! No room here! Get on the bus! Hurry! How can we get up?! Roof window! Dr. Lu. Zou Zhiming. My phone is without a signal. Try yours. We must tell the rescue team we don't have a fire now, ask him how they will locate us. No service here. Try yours. We have no service here. Call the police. Tell them that our fire is out. Ask them how the rescue team would find us. We don't have a signal either. Can't make the call. See this. Has he ever brought up the name of Lu Min? Hello? Hi. We called this line earlier. Our bus accidentally crashed into the river valley. You said you'd sent people here, and told us to light a fire to help you locate us. But now there's an accident.
