- Please, Kabe! - Andrea, it's very simple. I'll travel first and you then you join me. When? When? Nothing else matters. You know me. I don't do things half-ass. - I only see you leaving me. - Not you Andrea! The country! It's the same thing. Always remember: They'll come together again. Then get lost! Get out! Go over there! Arrest me! I'm having thoughts of fleeing. Go home, young man. Sleep it off. Quit fooling around! Freeze! Do your duty. What you see here is an illegal border crossing. - This one's got a loose screw. - Stop! Stand still or I'll shoot! - This can cost you 2 and 1/2 years. - 1 and a 1/2 at the most. Be honest. You've had the same thoughts too. Quick! Run! Move! - C'mon! - Freeze! Don't move! - This way! - Stop! Freeze! Watch out! They‘ll shoot! Let's go! C'mon! Give me a boost! We'll shoot you're all lunatics! 1! 2! 3! Fire! - Come on! Let's get out now! - Madness! - First they put you in the mad house? - Of course. And what did they diagnose you with in there? That I am clear in the head. Unbelievable. You keep risking 1.6 for nothing time after time. It's the safest and cheapest way to the West. And if they don‘t buy you? When they release me, I'll be back at the crossing. Take your 1.6 off first. Then you'll see things differently. We'll see. Move it! As the last Hebrew and the last lamb arrived across the shore, God commanded Moses: Stretch out your hand over the sea. Moses obeyed and thus the towering walls of water collapsed and buried the Egyptians with their wagons and horses. I'm not coming. Why not? Maybe I don‘t want to anymore. Always remember. 20,000 for a worker? Now, no one goes for less than 40,000. - You're an export article, not grain. - Export article? - Gas prices are going up, after all. - That makes 80,000. - Dropouts also? - 100,000. That makes 180,000. - And Volvo thieves? - Ah, 30,000 at the most. - That makes 210,000. - Plus aspiring dentists? 120,000. That makes 330,000. The whole bus full, that is 25 pieces, at 80,000 that’s... circa 2 Million Mark. - DM West? - Yes. Evening. Is it cold at yours too? - We have sun at ours. ⁃ I figured. Aaron, Jens? Schneider, Gertrut? Kiehle, Rolf? - Did you bring anything? - Yes. Thanks. I also brought something for you. - Here. From my home. - Thank you. - Kabe, Arnulf? - Here. Ministry of the GDR. Certified. Anyone else getting off? Hurry up and step on it! Where I can I make a call? Do you have any West Money? I need to call my wife. - Here. - Thanks. - Repeat, please. - Ernesto the phone rang. - It didn't ring. - Come now. It did ring! It didn't ring. Then let it keep ringing, Ernesto. This number is not in service. I'll put the service back, Miss. You can bet on it. After much effort and turmoil... Pardon me. I don't need to discuss the difficulties we have surpassed traveling through the border area as we made our journey. In this moment, you are certainly as moved as I am. That is why I don't want to give a long speech, but rather call out to each of you with all my heart: Welcome home, to Germany. 1000 kilometers from one to to the same city. Fear not Andrea. Stay strong. Both of us. We'll be reunited Hey! Helmut! Moses. What are you doing here? Coffee? Like at the Stasi. I know. I know. Our first impression can be misleading. We don't want to report or recruit you. That was always your introduction. I mean theirs. We only want to ask a few quick questions. I can't do anything for a short time. I'm full of information. Would you like to sit down? Have a cognac? Loosen up a bit? I prefer stiff. Have you ever had contact with officials from the Stasi? Everyone of us drank a Coke with them. When was your last meeting with them? First: I'm only speaking with your boss. Second: He must take two days for my case. Can you describe the room in which your talks took place? Excuse me. By then the Stasi knew my file by heart. You're not fooling me with your "would you likes" and "don't you wants?" Your counterparts over there are going full steam ahead. You play too much tennis. And don't take good care of your secretary. You've seen too much West TV. Stop it! Whoever is feeding you info are Stasi agents. Anyone wanting to subvert the Stasi would keep their mouths shut. Already finished? With the "Bundies". That's only half the portion. Wait a minute. Have you been to the Americans? They're almost as good as the Stasi. Yeah, hopefully. Us four... I mean, when there are four of us then we can... And then what? We have to stick together. We're 4 million in the West. Have you thought about that? 4 million. If we were to organize, how do you think our comrades on the other side would react? Look at the Jews in America. They've gone all out. - Together we are strong. - No, no my do-gooder. Rather to be weak for a few years and then independent. Whether I steal a Volvo over there or a Mercedes here, I only need a crowbar, not an organization. - Hello? - You can't get through? I'll find out the number of the repair center for you. Just give me the number of the Stasi. Oh, you're calling East Berlin. Berlin. They disconnected my wife's phone. Can I ask you some things? I'm Schacht. I'm preparing a piece about the integration difficulties for TV. Schacht? - Strange name. - I don't like my first name. I feel the same way. - Adolf? - Not too bad. And you? Walter? Josef? - Erich. - You're getting warm. My name is Kabe. What would you like to know? What's your first impression of this part of Germany. This isn't Germany. This is the West. How do you see the West? Can you move over there into the light? - Is there okay? - Yes. Okay. My first impression was... I thought to myself... Insanity. Yes. And? What they've accomplished here. We couldn't do that in 100 years. I mean the houses, the streets, the cars, the highways. Everything so smooth. So clean. The purest parquet floor. - Even the sun that... - Yes? What about the sun? Somehow it seems brighter here. Listen up you: I work for a critical magazine. The themes are more complex. Can we meet up again? - What for? - I'm writing a book on the GDR. I need content. This is not a problem. I'm filled with material. Here: my card. Money & Fame Agency for Reality Ciao. You think you're the greatest. - Excuse me. Can I ask you... - No, I can't now. I'm preparing a TV report. It's about Germany. I come here to the West and I step right into shit. - Don't talk nonsense, man! - Shit doesn't exist in the West! Like this or that? The Lord throws you into the middle of the sea. Until none of you remain. Man, Moses. I'm sorry about the other day. I had no time. Is this HQ? You, I live here. Can you turn that off? Sure. How are you, my friend? - How did you cross over here? - And you? Just look at you. Whaddya' mean? I just bought four suits. One for the disco. One for the pub. And one for the job center. And this one. This is my contact suit. It's so difficult to make contact here. "Du", I gotta tell you: the scene here is so broken. Since when do you start every sentence with "du"? "Du"... It's just a figure of speech to facilitate contact. But you'll learn soon. What's with our transmission? "Du"... There's no means of forming an organization here. I tried. But nobody can get their shit together. - Nobody wants anything here. You too? - Thanks. But take a seat first. Do you want to drink something? Whiskey? Vodka? Spanish cognac? Italian red wine? Amateur radio? Wait and see. Barbara? Hello. Oh, it's you. Good. This will be HQ. - What? - ID! Passport! Here. My ID. - And where are you headed? - To CIA headquarters. -CIA? -Yes. Do you have an appointment? Put me in contact. To whom? To the boss. - To the head of the CIA? - Yes. One moment. -Thank you. -Here. - Are you the boss? - No. What do you need? I want to work with you together. Undertake a plan. What kind of plan? - War. - War?!! - Yes. War. - Against whom? I'll can only share that with your boss. You're from the GDR, right? I have a precise plan. How long have you been in the West? - For two weeks. - Two weeks! Listen up dear "man": First find a job and experience life in this country. Call me in three years. I don't want to get to know this country. Yes, but you have to admit it: In the last years, Europe would have known no freedom without the Wall. Next question? West Berlin has one of the highest suicide rates. What interests me is how is the situation in East Berlin? Have you thought about suicide? What? Me? What kind of death would you choose? Pistol? Rope? Pills? Gas? Better you tell me how I can get by here. Go to Dr. Hempel. He will certify you as being mentally ill from prison. You'll be given disability money on top of your prison pension. Sick from prison that's good. Do it! Like this? Or that? What separates us, we shall tear down. Do not fear. The walls shall part. To the right. And to the left. Mrs. Kabe? May we come in? It's about your husband, Mrs. Kabe. - Have you heard from him lately? - No. - You don't know where he is living? - How am I supposed to know that? - He hasn't written to you? - No. Has he telephoned? The phone rings from time to time, but I rarely hear it. And the mail? You've applied to work for the Ministry of Foreign Trade, no? Yes. You know your duty concerning contact with the West? I'm telling you, I have no contacts and I have nothing to report. We're not accusing you at all. Fridays at 4. Window. Kabe. But haven't you already filed for a divorce? That was long ago. - And then you withdrew the claim? - Yes. You should reconsider your divorce, Mrs. Kabe. A ministry employee married to a convicted border felon, who now lives in the West, is a bad mix. Regarding your telephone, please contact the Post. You'll all be wondering. Do you have a hammer please? I've got a nail in my shoe. - Hammer? - Yeah, a hammer. Thank you. Thanks. - Will you be ordering food? - That depends on what you have. I can recommend: Let me take a look. Do you have boulette with cabbage? How much is a beer? -Three Mark. -Then bring me a beer. - No. Really, I don't. - Oh, but I do notice. What is it? - The tank was full this morning. - And? - This afternoon it was empty. - And? - It's five kilometers to Beate's. - So? - I don't want to pay for the gas. - Dear God! Again! Such a farce. - 50 Mark for the gas. - Anything else you wanna' say? No. - Can I use the phone? - Go ahead. Where are you calling? To Berlin. Oh, Berlin. Andrea? Who was that? Why didn't you tell me? Fuck off to where the sugar grows. How many times do I have to tell you, I'm not Cuban. Leave me alone! You idiot! Don't touch me! - Run! - Stay here! Move! Get in! - Why did you hit him? - I barely... He's so mistrustful. That's his problem. He picks his nails and never understands. And who are you? Do you want to drive him crazy? I don't want to sleep with you. But you want him to think that? I don't want anything. I just close my eyes and land somewhere. Do you want to go higher? Or lower? You want to drive him mad. Cross over there, if you want more of that madman. The Stasi told me she was with a Chilean. - But that was a lie. - A Stasi story. - Why didn't she come with you? - Because they won't let her go. I'll get her out. Does she want out? How can you be sure? That story doesn't compute in your head? Yes. Love: can it penetrate concrete? You're all so broken here. I don't want to know why. Because we don't have a wall to keep things like that out. Listen, I need to take my pill now. Could you bring me a glass of water? - Why should I? - I don't go into pubs. You're my friend, right? Help me. I need you to deliver this message to my wife: The last day of the month at 5 pm at Café Vienna. The rings come together. Do you got it? Last day of the month. 5 pm. Café Vienna. - The rings come together. - The rings come together. One. Two. Three. Four. Schacht? I want to ask you something. Listen, I've told you a hundred times. She wasn't there. What do you truly believe in? Something that is truly important to you. Something which burns inside. What now? In the middle of the night? Right now and all of the time. Have you gone crazy? It's two in the morning... It's a very simple question. I mean, there's got to be something in life so important... ...that makes life worth living. If I were to ask you the same now? I could tell you right away. No. Please don't. Hey do you remember me? The man with the hammer. I've been past your door twice. I wanted to tell you that I'm the right match for you. A good friend told me: When you say something your face means more than what is said. Then show me. And. What happens now? Maybe that was it and you don't know what to do next. Let's go. - Did you find an earring? - What kind of earring? A reminder. Of that stumbling guy from last time? Who do you mean? He never knows what he wants or he can never decide. I can. - What then? - Everything he can't. When I want something, I go through the wall. That's just a saying. Wait here. Are you crazy? I had them all standing there in my cell: Marx. Lenin. Ulbricht. And Moses. I let them go marching around over and over. Over the years, Marx and Lenin grew smaller. Only Moses remained. Are you kidding me? He was a madman, Moses. At first he didn't realize he was a prophet. After all, he was only an orphan and a stutterer as well. And then suddenly he stretched out his hand... Tickets please. - So, tickets please. - I don't know where mine is. Unbelievable. - Is that them? - Where did you get them? You took them from me. I don't like standing in front of locked doors. What do you think of them? Full of life, somehow. A fire station, huh? Just a second. Yeah. No, I can't. Why didn't you decide sooner? Don't try to blackmail me. Oh, it's so easy for you over the phone. No! Let's go somewhere else, please. - I won't let you leave. - Let me go! - You stay here until you... - Until what? Until you become the woman which I mean. I hope you have a lot of time. You are exactly the woman... which I would have hung over the bed in my cell. I'll send you a picture of me. How long were you in prison? - Long enough. - Where? Bautzen, Strelitz, Bedelheim, Pankow, Karl-Marx-Stadt. I got to know the whole GDR. From inside. You seem very proud of that. Proud? You all don't have a clue. But I am not her. What am I doing here with a "Zonie". What do I have to do with you anyways? Actually nothing. The only thing I like about you is your tick. You're not even here. Too much woman at once. You know you can't sleep here. Why not? Because it's just not possible. You're all so broken. Then go back to the other side where you come from. Say that again. Go back to the other side. Man! Are you suicidal? The West is this way! Watch it! Stop! Don't move! Let me in, you bastards! It's the looney from the psych ward. Handcuff me, I'm homesick. You violated the GDR border at 2:17 a.m. - Violation is good. - With what purpose? I want to go home. You live in West Berlin. Mehringdamm 66. Secondary residence. Primary: Berlin Ost: Eichendorfstr. 4. That was before, Mr. Kabe. On whose behalf did you climb over the GDR border fortifications? It's the most direct path. Cigarette? If so, a Karo. Thanks. You said the Marienfelde reception agent was named Kittel? Can you describe the man for us? What did the room look like where you were interrogated? Like this one What information did this Kittel want from you? What my interrogators in the East looked like. It won't be that easy with your relocation to the GDR. This is not the first time you have committed a border offense. December '72: 1 year juvenile sentence for a failed border crossing. June '74: 1 year, 6 months for attempted escape from the Republic. April '77: 2 years for unlawful border crossing. September '80: 1 year, 6 months for the same offense. But those were all in the opposite direction. You all constantly want to cross the border: One this way. One that way. Where is it you actually want to go? To the other side. You have to earn your way back into the GDR. I want to see my wife. What do I have to do? Witnesses reported, a drunk male, jumping from the West Berlin side into the death strip, setting off the alarms. The man was arrested by GDR border guards. His identity... Berlin, capital of the GDR. Yesterday in the late evening, was an incident at the border of the GDR. A young man from West Berlin, penetrated the GDR border security in Berlin-Mitte before surrendering to local security agents. This is Doctor Steiner. Insert the film normally. You already know how. If you are caught, quickly remove the film. This will erase it. Don't attempt to secretly take photos. The more open you behave, the better the results. If necessary, say you work for the Stasi. Be careful. Steiner is a dangerous man. See you when? Friday 5 pm? Friday is good. Show this ID and give your alias: Toni Voigt. But those people over there aren't dangerous. They have no secrets. They just have relationship problems. We know all of their secrets. We want to know how the people's minds work. Also yours. - Turn left! - What the hell! I wouldn't have done that in your place. Either you drive me to Eichendorf Strasse, or I walk away. Okay. Fine. How are you going to explain your presence here? Is she about to embrace a spy? You pigs. Why didn't she ever write you or visit you in prison? You know the reasons better than I do! You're making it too easy for yourself. But we shall see. From weekends at the Baltic Sea to traveling to the West. All included. If you can prove yourself. And if she wants it. Here. It's the Ho Chi Minh Trail. - You never heard of it? - No. Name? Toni Voigt. But I've told you a hundred times, I can't. There's not enough space here. I have a roommate. See him? He's from the other side. I can't just kick... See. He's asleep. Please, Barbara! Leave now! Please don't force me to...! Leave! Good-bye. Leave now. Let go Barbara. Please don't try to change my mind. Listen up. Leave me a note next time stay out fucking. I was going to call the police. Look: I've been eating out of cans for days. - Where were you? - The other side. I've sprained my neck. Can you give me a wet towel? Look now: if you want to sponge off someone, beat it. - I am completely exhausted. - What's going on? I was worried. Don't you get it? Viktoria too. We're real people over here too! - What did she say? - Well what all women say. - I know the text by heart already. - Just tell me. "You're only using me. You cannot love. Your mind is on other women. You just want to fuck." - Viktoria said that? - Barbara. She's killing me with her inspections. The last months she's combing me for blackheads, also in my private places. - Do you have that many? - Plenty. More and more. - We're expecting a baby. - A baby? That's great! Yes. In any case, there's no turning back. - You have to speak with her. - Me? Yeah. Talk with her. What do I say? It's crazy to have a baby at the end of the millennium. Why not this millennium? The planets were in this position twice and will be so again in 1984. And? Yes, the first time the World War 1 broke out. The next time came the 2nd. My prescription. Nothing but fear. You have everything here, but you're always afraid. Both of us and me... I mean we... Sure. But could you do me a favor? Could you get my prescription filled. I can barely stand up. You'll never change. Alias: Toni Voigt. Around 45 years old. Blonde hair. About 170 tall. Shoe size between 37 and 38. Wears finger rings. The watch -- A Western watch visible on the forearm. Probably to hide a scar. Auto: White Wartburg. Licenseplate: IA This was a message from Moses 2. Channel 3. Ladies and Gentleman. Dear comrades from the Kampfbund. Karl Marx's sentence: A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism. Has robbed your history of every joke. In the meantime, the ghost has settled in Germany. There is no more moving a testimony to the oppressions happening in the East, than that of those there who risk their lives in defiance of the state. This state has promised workers liberation from oppression. But the sons of the working class are fleeing the East in droves now. Where are the workers whom suffer from the so-called capitalist exploitation? Who risk death crossing minefields and barbed wire migrating to socialism? Only a few crazies rattle on today about the achievements of socialism. They should tell that to the workers over there. They would give our quixotic intellectuals the answer they deserve. With the worker's fist. I am also from the East. Nice to meet you. - What brings you to us? - The name Kampfbund. It's good. Are you alone? Don't worry, a buddy in Bautzen said you are exactly the right man for me. Ah, Bautzen. Right now we're short on funds. Thanks. I would like to work with you. What do you have in mind? Fighting. Real fighting with commitment. You know our program? Program? I mean, both of us, you and I. Together we can we can do something. You can talk and I can weld and solder. - Weld and solder? - I learned in prison. But I can also shoot and blow things up. I have abdicated explicitly for a spiritual offensive against communism. You have to in public, Dr. Steiner. But we're all alone here. In plain language we both mean mean the same thing. First the weapon of criticism and then the critique with weapons. - You learned that too, no? - How am I to understand this? This is illegal. Anyone serious is always "illegal". Be careful! He's a snitch. - Doctor Steiner. - Yeah. Watch your back. - It's you. - May I come in? I wanted to ask if you found your earrings? My earrings? - Here, I brought you something. - It's so lovely. - Where did you get it? - My talisman. It's a gift. Should I wear it on the left? - Or right? - Right. Where is the match? What are you up to there? If I knew I wanted it, I'd start to fight against this woman in your head. Here. - Nollendorfplatz, please. - Occupied. Whaddya mean, occupied? You don't understand occupied? Drive, please! See that window on the third floor there? Do you know what's going on there? My wife's with somebody else in bed. With a "Zonie". - Someone from the other side. - Drive! Is there something better about them? Have nothing? Want everything? No manners? Straight from prison, comes here and lies down in a fresh bed! What do they have to offer? I'll tell you what's wrong with the wall: it's not airtight! I think I'd rather walk. Come on. Let's walk a little faster. What's wrong with you? The city is filled with agents. C'mon! Get in! Come on, get in! Don't just stand there! - Name? - Toni Voigt. Come with me. Just always stick to the five W's. Who. When. Where. Why. What. Be extremely precise. What is observation and what is presumption or suspicion. A simple method -- start each sentence with a whisper to yourself: I observe. I assume. I estimate. I'll pick you up in three hours. Steiner circa mid-fifties. Founding member of a so-called Kampfbund for a Free Germany. I assess he's totally harmless. Can't get his ass in gear. I am unable to determine his plans or goals. Or his hopes. I have observed. I have suspected. I have assessed. Where I am, I don't want to stay. I can't live with you, I can't be without you. Though I can't be without you I have to live without you. I can't be with you, but without you there's no life, Barbara. Barbara I can't live with you. I can't be without you. Though I can't be without you, I must live without you. I can't be with you, but without you there's no life. Barbara, did you understand me? ...I can't live with you. I cannot be without you. Barbara: do you understand me? It only works with benzine, but it's beautiful. You met with Andrea? She said you probably missed it. When can I see her? She wishes you luck and a nice beginning in the West. Can she leave the country? As far as I know, she's filed for divorce. That's when I was in prison. Later she withdrew the claim. That's right. She only filed for divorce because she was being blackmailed. Couldn't it be the other way around? She free-willingly divorced the man who always wanted to leave. And after she filed for the divorce, she withdrew it again. Our operatives sometimes cause the opposite effect. That's a lie. Did she say that? She's a smart woman and didn't say a word. He's one of yours. Our arm reaches far, but not into the heart of a woman. This envelope has critical information. Give it to Steiner. Yeah and... What happens next? I don't know. You have no further reasons to come here. The concrete wall has had its day. You all will have to jump over the wall in your heads now. By the way, I stumbled across an important lead. Moses 2. Channel 3. Never heard of it? A broadcast for the 4 million Ost-refugees in the West. Nah, Toni. When and where does it broadcast from? Next Sunday I'll inform you of the time. Where have you been all this time? I'm sick. Listen, it's not just my circulation. For days I've had this pressure under my shoulder blade. Could you...? Here. Could you massage it there? Underneath. - Here? - Higher up. - Here? - No, to the right. The lungs are there, aren't they? Bullshit! Those are just muscles. That's it. You know, they took an x-ray. They told me... Well what? I have to go back. You, Kabe. If I have cancer, will you promise me... You and cancer. You're way too manic. No cancer cell could handle you. Can you at least cook for me? I'm dying of hunger. Ladies and gentlemen. Dear friends of the Kampfbund. In the long history in our people's struggle for freedom, there have been small and large heroes. The man... which I wish to present to you here, is a great hero. Through the means of a self made hang-glider, this man is not acting out of discontent to rescue our freedom. No! He performs this act, here and now in order to once again set an example in front of the whirring cameras of the Western world. And he will show the world: How much ingenuity, how much courage, how much will for freedom, the sons of the working class have to muster to escape the so-called state of the workers. Remember me? Ah yes, the madman who wanted to blow up the wall. Didn't work out, huh? Hatred subsides with time Doctor Steiner. I met with your son. I'm supposed to give you this. Where is he now? We didn't talk about that. Do you know what's inside? He's been sending me this for years. Photocopies. Old things nobody cares about anymore. SS Sturmbannführer I should tell you, he will have this published in West Germany if you don't stop your work. I've explained this to him time and again. He's so angry. He needs to be told how life is in a dictatorship. That's what you do everyday. He doesn't listen to me. Do you know what? One can do as they wish. One's own children... What does your father do? - Major with the people's army. -You see! The sons might think they want this or that. But in the end they only want to kill their fathers. This is Moses 2. Channel 3. Do not fear. Stand strong. Stay resilient. We are a group of democratically minded communists, whom turn for the first time... Our goal is without limits. Hereby Germany is declared a united and indivisible republic. It's better to die in the desert, than to serve the Egyptians. But that means: Removal of all foreign troops. The withdrawal from all pacts. Tanks in the Amazon. Peace on earth. We must tear down the walls between us. By this, I mean eradicate all circumstances which enable hate and subjugation amongst human beings. As long as the walls stands between us Andrea, we will never know our true selves. Which is better? "Our goal is to be established throughout Germany.", or, "Our goal is a Pan-German establishment."? You know, I heard voices in my dreams saying: "A democratic communist Pan-Germany." Does this even exist? So, how should one phrase it? What do you need this for anyways? For the transmission. Send them coffee and toothpaste. Ubricht is already cheap over there. We're prepping a transmission, not a food packet. We discussed a book before, not a transmission. You have to take action first, Schacht. Then you can write. Smart ass. Mister Barnim. I recently saw your TV committee presentation. Keep it up. - What committee? - Freedom and socialism. You're making a mistake, Mr. Barnim. I mean if we both... You and I... Together, we could achieve something. Make it quick. I'm in the process of building up an organization. But one can't talk about it in public, or the Stasi will catch onto it. - But the Stasi is a paper tiger. - The city is full of agents. All of my state appointments here, I always see a Stasi plant there. They don't need to invade, they're already in position. They're only waiting for the command on day X and then everyone from the mayor to the janitor pulls their party badges out of their pockets. That means: You too, Mr. Barnim! And then what is your exact proposal? - No! I gotta run! - Mr. Barnim? What are you doing? Don't worry, it won't make it into the papers. We know that already. I also work for the Stasi. Yeah. Kabe, I finally wanted to introduce you two. I guess I owe you an apology, huh? For what? For the other day. I just went a little crazy, huh? I'm talking to you! What does this "Westler" have that I don't? What should I do? Feign sensitivity? Have problems reaching orgasm? Don't you have them? Let's go. I know that guy. From the other side. He's very sharp. Sharp? I would like to go away with you for a day. Where? To the land where you can make a sharp turn. I don't think they'll let you back in. You know me. When I want something, I go through the wall. And what would I do there? No! Sorry. He has problems with his wife. You can't let her down, do you hear? Let her move in. No more half measures. Somehow I am curious. I don't really know what to do with myself over there. You tolerated things here far too long. You only know half of yourself. What you search for here and never find, is over there. The East. I know enough from television. What interests me more is this woman in your head. Be careful. You go ahead and I'll cross after. Café Vienna. 5 pm. You'll be there? I'll be there. Toni Voigt. And? What now? - What can I get you? - I'm just on my way. I'll be right back. I forgot something. Mental. Come. In your pocket is a West Pass. Learn the data by heart. I'lll meet you in the West in two hours. Heinrich-Heine-Strasse crossing. Who is that? I should get going. Viktoria, I... Hey, you trading West money? One for six. Here, you can have this. It's yours? A West Pass? Nope. I've tried everything but, I don't think you can be helped. What a pity. This way. Do you know what this is? What will you do if I keep this passport... and cross over? Do you want to go? Do you know what that means? Aiding an escapee. Where is Schacht? In the pharmacy, probably. You're Barbara. He's vanished. He should've been back hours ago. Don't worry. It'll all be fine. Especially once the baby is here. What do you mean, child? Yeah, but you're having a baby together, no? Did he tell you that? I'm the man you've been waiting for. Wait a minute. Give me Peter Falk. This is the German people speaking. I have an important announcement for you. Your days here are numbered. Our program is operational. Moses 2. Channel 3. 1600 megahertz. Thanks. It's about Germany. I only did this all for you. I have to go. I was only Viktoria for a night. But maybe we'll trade places again. It wasn't such a bad idea. Andrea! Don't go! When you want Andrea, you know where to find her. Fear not. See to it that everything will change. So long as there are walls between us, we will never know our true selves. We're moving too fast. We must begin again as "no one".
