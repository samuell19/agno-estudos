Are you tourist in Kandahar? I was a soldier. Three years ago, with the Australians in Uruzgan. We did a raid on a village. Gaz-i-kar. A man stepped into his doorway and I shot him. A woman and children dragged his body back inside the house. That money's for them. This is compensation? Yeah. Why do you care about one dead Afghan? Your people have killed thousands of us. Get up, get up. Water. Face. English? Little bit. What's your name? Amir. Amir. Yes. Come with me. Not too far. One of my brother died here. He had a shop in Kabul. He come back to see his wife and children. Everyone was murdered here. My brother and his wife and three children. They murdered by American drone. For us they are all our father, grandfather, uncles, children, wife, brothers, sisters. But for your people this is just an accident. This is special for you. We Pashtun say death, honour, fuller stomach better than a life of hunger. Eat. Janaat? Janaat make this for you special. Good. Please tell him thank you, it's very good. Just eat and no worries. You want to give this money to the dead man's family. To a Pashtun it's like selling you his dead. Pride loves revenge. Where are you taking me? We are taking you to Rasigah. Why are you helping me? You are our guest. I'm a hostage. Same thing. If you want to say sorry to these villagers, you need to say. No. Let's go. The village chief, his name is Dawood Khan. This money is a curse. Why you come here for? For what you come here? I've been here before. I took part in the raid. Why you come back here? I killed one of your brothers. I'm here to confess. We came in from over here. The helicopter dropped us over there. Three of my team were with me. The rest came in from behind. Men were firing from a compound over there. I know now they were not Taliban. Just your men protecting their homes and their families. We passed the edge of this building. We came to this wall. There was a burst of gunfire. And as I turned, a man stepped into that doorway there. Before I knew it, I shot him. A woman and children dragged his body back inside. But I knew he was dead. This is the place. The man that was shot, his name was Atta-Ulah Khan. Just a musician.
