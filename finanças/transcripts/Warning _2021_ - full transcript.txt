Ground control to David. Please provide a status update on the meters. Um, I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at. You know, I'm just a maintenance technician, right? For the entire galaxy. You are categorized as low-level maintenance crew. And when am I gonna get a... An Android up here? Are you feeling lonely? I'm alone. I'm not lonely. Anyway, robots are awful company. I just... I don't like these spacewalks. An Android companion is not an approved expense. Um, can you really put a value on human life? You were registered at a cost of $500,000. The Android costs $40 million. Please get us those readings stat. Humans on eaith are not handling the recent surge in thunderstorms well. Yeah, I got your readings right here all right. - Warning! - Mayday. Mayday, mayday! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Ground control, what the hell just happened? - Warning! - Hey! Warning! Ground control, can you hear me? Hello! Hello! Christ! A lot of them are strays, or turned in by owners who can't take care of them anymore. I need one that has some wine knowledge and won't spill. My mom's a bit particular. What about these two? This one is Charlie. He's a fully operational companion robot. He served as an excellent end of life caretaker for elders. - He's great. - Hm. - Is his outfit changeable? - Yeah, sure, yeah. Do you want to get to know Charlie in the meeting zone? Hm, okay, yeah. I'm super easygoing. Comfortable with any conversation topic. You can't shock me, hm? I can say "one more beer" in over 48 languages. Take me on holiday. You're in for a real treat. Can he clean pools? Actually, Charlie is a little sensitive with water. Oh, come on, Brian, I bet you're no mermaid either. I am great at doing the dead-man float. Am I right? Uh, no. Can I please meet the other one? Let's take this outside. So, so, you like wine? Uh, my mom does. Okay, listen to this. What did the grape say when it was being stepped on? - Uh, I don't know? - Nothing. He just let out a little wine. Huh? Am I right? Am I right? - What did she say about me, huh? - It's a hard pass, Charlie. It was the dead-man float shtick, huh? A little too dark, wasn't I? I don't think she's your type of crowd. You weren't made for young ones like that. I'm like a fine wine... - Complex but very, very fruity. - Yeah. That should be plenty enough walking. Okay, it's bedtime, Charlie. I need to go get some rest. Okay. Close your eyes, Charlie. He can cook. He makes amazing desserts. He's great at small household tasks. No, no, he can't fix electrical equipment. He's an older model, he will try. But he's amazing. No, I understand. We'll call you if we get one of those. I see here you said to not call, my bad. Have a nice even... Asshole. Eva, engage thrusters. - Thrusters damaged. - Eva, engage thrusters. - Thrusters damaged. - Eva? - Ground control, talk to me. - Connection stream interrupted. - Connection stream interrupted. - Repeat that, please. - Repeat. - Lost connection with comm center. What do I do? What's the protocol? Lost-lost-lost... lost connection... Lost connection with comm center. - Sorry, repeat. Repeat... - Lost connection with comm center. - Lost connection with comm center. - Fuck. Good morning, Claire. Can I please have my daily inspirational quote? Of course, Claire. Today's inspiration is... "The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today." I like that. Thank you, god. Claire, I'm changing the music. This is not conducive to spiritual growth. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Hi, my name is Chad. I'm 24 years old, I love sports... Hi, I'm Lauren, and my best qualities are not on the outside. Sinners. I keep having bad thoughts. - And what are they, Claire? - I feel envious of Sarah, and so I keep fantasizing about her husband cheating on her and then she has to come home and she goes crazy. Envy is the at of counting another's blessings instead of your own. What are my blessings, god? Um, my love for you, and your wallpaper. Claire, I heard that. Uh, heard what? You hit a car. No, I didn't. Lying. One sin recorded. How many sins have I committed this month? You are at nine venial sins this month. At ten sins, you will be charged $25.99 per venial sin. Can I just remove the last sin? To remove the most recent sin, here are your options: One, take responsibility. End of options. Okay. - Thanks, god. - You're welcome, Claire. New update available. New features... future foresight, communication with up to seven deceased relatives and wireless compatibility. To update overnight, say "yes" at the tone. Yes. 80, Brian, you gonna buy me dinner first, or we just gonna get right to it? Charlie, tell me, what do you know about sex? Huh? It's the motion of the ocean that matters the most. Am I right? Yeah, you're right. Are we doing a full body scan again? We did one last week. Yeah, just one more. Is it because of my highbrow sense of humor that's upsetting people? Everyone's getting checked again before the holidays. Right. The holidays. You spending them with someone special? No, not really. You know, you should just spend them here. I'm great company. Yeah, you're right. That does sound nice, actually. Would it be too much trouble to dress up as Santa claus? Whatever you want, Charlie. - Let me help you. - Oh, come on, Brian. I never had Santa as a child. - You never were a child. - Oh, good point. Am I doing something wrong, Brian? You're doing everything wrong. Don't hold back. I'm serious, though. I've been in this place for two months to the day. I've never met anybody that was here past the two-month Mark. You know, it would be nice if somebody young took me home that got me. You know, like you. You can do much better than me. Better? I don't wanna seem needy, Brian. But we get along great. You're my friend. - Trust me, you can do better. - You're my friend, though, right? Of course, Charlie, I'm yourfriend. Okay, lie down. We have this new machine. So just lie down. - And you need to close your eyes. - Okay. Can you play some music? Sure. Can you turn it up a bit? I love that song. Sure, buddy. God? God? God! Wake up. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. God? God 2.0 customer service. Please hold for the next available operator. Oh! God 2.0 customer service. This phone call may be recorded. Please state your name and product serial number. Hi, my name is Claire Larry, - and how do I find the serial number? - Can you request it from god? I can't. He's not there. Oh, did you recently do the update? - Yeah. - Ooh, well, that's not good. - Why, what does that mean? - Well, we've been having some technical issues with that since the storm. I'm afraid I can't help you over the phone, Clark. Um, my name's Claire. And my last name is Larry. Oh, okay, Larry. I think the easiest way is to make an appointment with the holy genius bar. What took you so long to ask me out? Mm, I don't know. Just thought you wouldn't be into it. I never said I was. Hey, baby. Say hi to the camera. What? What should I do? Um, whatever your heart desires. - Um, smoke rings. - Oh, you can do smoke rings? - Mm-hmm. - Prove it. Sick smoke rings, Anna. They say perfect circles don't exist, - but you just proved them wrong, baby. - Fuck. By the way, totally worth you looking a little gross. I look gross? Do I look gross? - You're so beautiful. - You're the worst. Okay, stop. Fuck. You're still here. Stop staring at me. What the hell? Come on. - Hello? - Hey, you on your way? Yeah, I'm on my way, you creep. Suffocating me already. Jesus. - You know that's why you love me. - Wait, wait, do you have wine? Yes, I got a bottle of red right here. - Okay, I'll see you in five. - Okay, bye. God... If you can hear me... right now... I'd, uh... I really, uh... I don't know. Shit. Okay, all right, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Let me start again. God?! I-I never asked you for anything. I've never even spoken to you. Huh. I always figured the universe would, you know, lead me to wherever I needed to be. But, uh, I don't think this is the right way. Recalculating route. Insert new destination. Not now, Eva. Jesus! All right, well, what's going on? I mean, what am I... What are we doing here, huh? What-what's the lesson here? What, that I'm selfish? I already knew that. I mean, like, what, do I look like father material? I mean, there's people down there fucking. They're fucking and they're murdering each other, and you're coming after me? You better get your priorities straight, buster. I mean, if you think I deserve this... Well, maybe you should have made me better. I mean, this might actually be your fault. I mean, as far as fathers go, you're not very good either! Either. Shit. I look gross? Do I look gross? Is it bad? You look beautiful. Sorry, it comes out every once in a while. That was not a goat. That wasn't a goat? What was it then? That was a sheep. Oh, you really know your farm animals. Um, okay, what does a goat sound like? Do it for me. Ba-ha-ha. That's a donkey, that is not a goat at all. - By the way, I just want to say... - What? I'm sorry for getting you a burger. - Why are you sorry for... - Well, I should have gotten you hay. Hey. Hey, what's going on? Come here. This thing... he follows me. - Hey, it's okay. - I see it all the time. It's gonna be okay. Mwmu I have an appointment. Yeah, I know. - So? Okay, so here's the problem. Never update without doing a manual restart. Oh, no, that's not true. He just said, "say yes at the tone," and then he died. Did you hold down the button till god shut down and restarted? - No. - Okay then. Oh! I see you pay for the cloud monthly, so at least you have a backup of your good deeds and sins. Can you see my sins? You want me to? Okay, so moving on. You back up every day, right? Yeah, no, no, I don't, sometimes, maybe. Okay, what's going to happen is we can offer you a discount on a new system. How long have you been with your current god? - Four years. - Wow. Okay, you're supposed to renew your faith every 18 months. - No, you're not. - Yeah. I'm surprised he stayed with you this long. Just give me a new mode! Then. He'll be shipped to you by tomorrow. How am I gonna pray? You'll have to do it manually. Are you there? Hello? God? This is so stupid. Where are your parents? God... oh, shit. God 2.0 customer service. This phone call may be recorded. So, I've been trying to pray manually and, uh, nobody's answering. So, I feel... kind of stupid, and I was just wondering if maybe... You could talk back to me while I do it? Ma 'am, we do not provide spiritual responses to god 2.0 customers over the phone. I can sign you up for an automated hotline service for just a $199 per month. No, no, uh, of course you don't. That's... just... I actually was asking just if you could maybe do just quick response, like, um, just an inspirational quote, you know, "best preparation for tomorrow is.. Or something about today or just getting through. Uh, no. I'm sorry, ma 'am. Is there anything else I can help you with? Hello? Hello, ma 'am? Buenos dias, Larry. - Oh, god. - Ginglés? - Si, si, inglés. - Good morning, Larry! Congratulations for choosing god 2.0! New and improved! Wireless, waterproof, non-flammable and simply indestructible. Made exclusively from recycled bots, god 2.0 is saving you and the planet. Larry, come on down to mattress deluxe where we have thousands of mattresses at wholesale prices! Jesus fucking Christ. You used the lord's name in vain. One sin recorded. You having trouble gaining muscle mass? - No. - Of course you do! Trainers are going out of business because of protein water. Make it stop. Uh, stop ads, please. To stop adveitisements, sign up for premium god 2.0. To roll your eyes at god is a sign of contempt. One sin recorded. - Can you see me? - Yes, I see everything. The new god 2.0 is equipped with visual sensor technology. - Shit. - Swearing. One sin recorded. Turn off. The new god 2.0 has an eternal battery life, and cannot be powered down. Forever in your presence. Making you a better person, always. No, no, no, no, no! You know, I haven't been back to this area since I was a kid. There was a slight incident. There was some fireworks and a friend's robot. What happened? I might have blown it up. And I was never invited back, you know, so I'm feeling the pressure. Okay, probably best not to mention that at dinner tonight. No, you don't think they'd like that? - Probably not. - Probably not. I thought it'd make me a bit dangerous, but whatever. I get it. I get it. But I'm serious, I'm really nervous. You know, I've never been with someone of your kind. What, someone so privileged, and so self-loathing? - Yeah, all my favorite parts about you. - Hmm. I was actually having some doubts about you and I. Hey! That's mean. I think it's a little odd that you would use my childhood sippy cup as an ashtray. You... the childhood sippy cup is odd. - Who gave you the sippy cup? - My mom. It's exactly for that reason I find the sippy cup a little bit weird. - It's sentimental. - Do you not think that that's a reminder of what it was like to attach to the last... I'm going to say it, nipple-like thing in your life? No, seriously. Seriously. Is she... is she going to hate me? - Really? - Is she really mean? - Yeah. Well, I'm really great, so I'm going to make this amazing. She's going to love me. Watch this. So strange. What a strange... house Oh, is that... is that... - Do you have a dog? Is that...? - No. Do you think that's something on my shoe? - Look... do you think that's dog poo? - No, you look fine. I cannot go into your house smelling like dog shit. - Yeah. - That's just a no-go. This is so embarrassing. Are you sure? - Yeah, you're fine. - Oh, I smell like poo. Ooh! The door opened. - Where's your mom? - Hello, darling! Come on in. Your father and sister are in the game room. Oh, god. - If you wanna watch the master. - That's what I rolled. See how it goes. Take a nap, he takes forever. Yeah, thank you. Watch, guys. Watch, guys. - Yeah! - No! Oh, I'm so pumped. - Wow. - So gonna pl... I'm killing on this. Looks like you built a water park instead, dad. Don't tell your mother. Ron, I think that's enough now. We should never have installed a home optics system. Word of advice. Keep the home optic stuff to the bedroom, you don't need it for the whole house. Eww, dad. Stop. No, most accidents happen in the bedroom. So, you finally admit that Olivia is an accident? You're an accident, Liam. Except you happened in the living room. - Wait, where? - Ay, ay, ay. Right, your go. No cheating like your sister. - Yes! - Watch and weep. Well, apparently mission control lost contact with him. You'd think they'd just get robots to do it by now. Why would anybody go up there? Sometimes you just need some space. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Nina, let him do it. That's what he's programmed for. We just adopted him a couple of days ago. We only rescue. It's the best thing to do. Why don't they rescue the space guy? The news said that rescue mission is impossible. I wonder what he's thinking about. Floating up there, all by himself. Probably... nothing. I think that that's the best part, you can just shut off the old computer. So you wouldn't be thinking about me then, Ron? Well, of course, hon. By "nothing", I meant nothing else but you. - Good save. - Thanks. No, I'm not buying it, Liam. I can't even float alone through space without her telling me what to do. You know, I think there's, uh, something poetic about floating through space like that. Why? Well, 'cause you know how it's gonna end. What's poetic about dying? Everything. It's so primitive to think that the only way a life has meaning is if you know it's going to end. Um, not really, mom. I mean, not everyone is blessed with the luxury of eternal life. Oh, I'm sorry. Should we be ashamed of how blessed we are? No, I just don't think that we should rub it in our guest's face. I apologize, Nina. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. Oh... Don't worry, I'm... I'm not uncomfortable at all. I actually like being mortal. See, not everyone is dying not to die. Sure. But I would assume that given the choice, anyone with a sane mind would choose to go on living. Well, I didn't have a choice. I wasn't born in the same tier group you were, so I didn't get to choose. But I'm okay with that. But don't you feel like you're missing out on so much time? Well, I mean, time just becomes more precious. There we go with the primitive thinking. What's your issue? We, as a family, of course we're really excited about Nina. She's really lovely. - But, we do have some... - Concerns. - Concerns, yes. - We have some concerns. All right, I mean, I'd love to hear them. None? Nothing? Mom and dad think you dating a mortal is a waste of time. I never said it in those words. Look, Nina, I-I think you're very lovely. But we have to be realistic here. Well, I mean, please, do tell us your ultra-modern take on this, uh... It's a big sacrifice to waste time on something that's going to end. And especially when that end is so heartbreaking. No offense, Nina. Oh, none taken. She's going to get sick, and then she will die. Do you really need to be around there for that, Liam? I love this woman, so I want to spend all the time I can with her. Don't you see what you're doing, Nina? - Hold on. - I'm not doing anything. You're dragging him down with you. Why can't you find someone of your own kind? You know, uh... I wasn't planning on telling you guys today. But... I've decided to die naturally with Nina. - Excuse me? - I'm turning it off. I don't think so. - What? - I don't wanna live forever without you. That's crazy talk. Why, just spend time with her then. - Don't kill yourself over it. - I'm not killing myself. Look, have your fun now, and then, when she dies, do a memory reset. Delete her. That is so cold. I'm a romantic too. You've got so much more time and accomplishments ahead of you. So I can what? Hmm? Make more money? Then what? Get another hobby? Learn another language I'm never gonna use? When you can do anything you want tomorrow, today doesn't really matter. I made my decision. You know you can't reverse this. - Once you switch it off... - Mm. You'll be just like them, like her. You'll age, you'll get sick and then... Liam, you know, I'd never ask you to do this for me. It's my choice. I'm not gonna let this happen. Absolutely no way. Well, you know, I think it's about time I went for a cigarette. Oh, great! She smokes as well! As if her life wasn't short enough. Okay, okay. Hello? Anna, it's Ben. You're closer than 50 yards. - Leave or I'm calling the cops again. - I just... I just wanna talk. Okay, I was trying to figure out why you left that night and... - I left because... - I know, okay? - You're that thing... - I realized I fucked up. I've been telling you to stop coming here for months now. Please, Anna. I'm coming down. Ben, something is really wrong with you. I know, I-I miss you. You stalked me using that creepy virtual program. You did this. It was you, in that fucking thing the whole time. No, Anna, no, I-I didn't know. Okay, this is so fucked. It's ruining my life too, you know. I wish I could block you on it. No. No, you don't mean that. Ben, stop living in my past. I don't wanna see you again. - Anna, it's our past. - Ben, I'm telling you... - Anna, please. - Ben! Oh, fuck. Eva, how much air do I got left? You have six days, 11 hours and 34 minutes left. I'm losing my fucking mind. Eva, can I talk to you? David, I am detecting a change in body temperature. Ah... okay. I should probably tell you right now, um, I got a kid. My ex, she barely lets me see her anyway, so... Can I be honest with you? I-I didn't even want her. I thought it would... Ruin everything, or... Not like I had anything, but... That's the point, you know? I like being alone. Or at least I-I used to. You know how this kid looks at me? Like I am everything. The thing I wanted the least wants me the most. I don't deserve that. Nah, she's better off without me. You know what? I deserve this. Hey, god, you're right. This makes perfect sense now. David, please repeat your request. Memory storage almost full. Deleting old files. Life support system unaffected. A spokesperson for NASA says that the satellite likely suffered damage to its guidance control system... During a standard inspection and repairs operation. Peiforming routine maintenance on the satellite was set to return to eaith immediately. Where are my cigarettes? I don't know, mom. Where are you going, huh? I told you. I'm spending the weekend at Deb's house. - Why do you always leave me alone? - No, I don't. Your father left me. Now, you're leaving me. Everyone leaves me. It's only for the weekend, mom. Fine, go. You don't give a shit about your mama. No, that's not true. Leave me like a lonely dog. I don't want you here. - Hey! - What's up? Nothing, it's my mom again. Welcome, pawel novac. Hello. Uh, hi, I was wondering, uh... Yes, yes, hi. Um, I saw, uh, the shampoo and the conditioner in the bathroom, and, uh, I was just wondering maybe... There was any body lotion available? Just text my mom back if she texts me, okay? - And what if she calls? - Don't pick up. How much are you making on this? Enough to pay for my own place for six months. - Are you fucking serious? - Yeah. What do you think he's gonna do? I don't think he's gonna have a quiet night at home. He told me to shave my pussy and bring party dresses. What if he does something messed up with you? I don't think he's a psycho. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh... Oh, for fuck's sake. No. Oh, Jesus Christ. You people are gonna live forever. Smoking is not gonna kill you. Jesus! Liam? Liam?! What the...? Liam? Liam? Liam? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Liam? Liam? What? Liam? Dora! Dora! Dora, stop! Liam! Liam, no! No! Stop! Dora, stop! Liam. Can I help you? Liam. Liam. I've been looking for you. I've been looking for you. Hi, I'm Liam. Liam, show this young lady out, please. Can I help you? Good bye, Nina. - Magda? - Yes. Come in. I've prepared him now, he's ready to go. Strip down, please. Take off your clothes. I need to prep you. You are basicallyjust going to sleep while his mind takes over your body. He will be fully in control of your motor functions. Uh, what if he does something very stupid and I get hurt? What if I die? If you die, he dies. That would be unlikely. But remember, you signed all papenivork. So if he did something to hurt you... It would cost him a lot of money. We've never had any cases that things go horribly wrong. You're just basically taking a nap and waking up a little richer. Okay. Do it. Hey. Hey! It's done. I smell so good. Hello. Hi! You will wake up in 48 hours. Wait, are you not taking my body somewhere? You are your own responsibility. You are not authorized. Hi. Um, I can't seem to get into my room. - And what room are you in? - Three-five-three. All right, let me check. It looks like there is only one person on the room. - Pawel... - Pawel novac. It's my dad... I guess. You guess? It's my dad. Okay, look, I'm not supposed to let anyone in who's not on the list. But you don't look like you're going to kill anyone. If you need anything, just let me know. Thanks. Hmm, no. Definitely no. Bonng. Mm-hmm. It's weird weather, huh? Your, uh, daddy's out late. - What's happening? - What do you mean? I don't know, parties? It's late. You know, everything's closing up. Can I have a cigarette? Though I do know of a party. It's an after-hours type thing. You don't need ID. But you don't really look like the type of person that might enjoy it. No, I wanna go. I'll tell you what, I get off in half an hour. Why don't I take you? And I've never felt... More alive my entire life. And I don't mean that in a good way. Eva, new voice memo. Voice recording initiated. So this next part's not for you. It's for my daughter. Emma... Emma...

Please don't leave me. Do you believe in god? Me neither. I do believe in goat people. Goat peeps. Stay tuned for late breaking news.

So this is how it ends. They say every end is a new beginning, but that ain't true. People just say that 'cause they wanna feel better. It's easier to live in an illusion than it is in reality. What is this thing called "love" anyway? Did I ever give enough of it? Does anyone? I thought everything made sense, but none of this does now. I thought I was in control. But I'm not. How the hell am I the last man alive? How the hell does that happen? Emma. Recording interrupted. David, you have run out of storage space. Last saved recording. Whenever you see a star twinkling...

I'm sorry, it's been pretty hectic around here. But I'm here for you now. My child, how may I help you? Are you fucking kidding me?
