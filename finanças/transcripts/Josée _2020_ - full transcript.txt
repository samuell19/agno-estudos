Judulnya "Do You Like Brahms?" [Like Brahms in korean and Aimez-vous Brahms in france] I intended to buy a book at that time, When? The day I sat falling from a wheelchair on the street. Even though this is the truth that I will learn later, Josee is the name of the female lead in the novel. Josee took the female lead's name, then named himself Josee. Halo? / - It's me, Josee. Oh? yes. You just need to take this kid out That child named ... Young Bong. Young Bong? Is there anything I can help? Is there a kid named Jong Bong? Who? Jung Bong - You wanna die? - What?

[i can't hear properly what they're said] So what? Don't eat too much meat Don't forget to eat propolis too He said propolis is very good for health So, in the used books that your grandmother collected, is now someone discussing propolis? Yes, it is true. You stupid. Keep your manners. How dare you say that to your mother who orders to eat healthy food. What? Why are you also my mother? Whenever you visit the house, your grandmother's items are damaged and must be repaired. Please fix it. Why fix it? Besides, I don't know how to fix it either. Why do you call yourself her mother? Why must there be a special reason for being a mother? Mother is mother. He is a poor boy. His mother left him for economic reasons. Then my father took her home, From then on I promised to become a mother for him. Oh, I see. Then is your father different from your father in Budapest? Yes, different. Are you an orphan too? Your grandmother said your parents abandoned you. I'm not an orphan. My father is a cop in the crime division. Even though he has now died while on duty to catch the serial killer. Why do you believe in all that shit? My grandmother said that because she wanted to fool you. You stupid! The trees around here are very beautiful. The color is also very pretty These leaves are very beautiful, because they fall ... beautifully ... and calm down ... then they died. I like someone who also likes coffee I also like someone who enjoys coffee I would even prefer someone who can know how to taste coffee. And the person I like the most is the person who asks me for coffee. Have you been looking for a job? Yes, I'm still looking for a job. Oh, I see. If you want, you can try an internship In a brand marketing company, Even though it's not a big company, it's also quite well known. Is it true? But that doesn't mean you can immediately intern at the company, you still have to do an interview first. Even so, the director at that company is a teacher who taught us nine years ago. He will be very considerate of you. Is it true? I really thank you. Please drink The taste will definitely be very good and the taste is very soft. Ah, really? What are you doing? I'm working on an assignment from Professor Choi. Oh, I see. For thesis research, huh? / Yes, that's it. He always told students to do his research. Don't you mind? And now you do it again. Not for a thesis, but just a regular research article. However Professor Choi is very nice to me. It's also thanks to doing this that I'm learning more. Yes, he also offers you a place to work on condition that you do all of this. This coffee is really good - Where did you buy this coffee? - I got it from the vending machine. Oh, I see. I don't understand how to fix it. Yes? Just leave it there, then I'll fix it slowly. Have you eaten? He is indeed a strange child He always lies and fantasizes strange things, then thinks all his imagination is reality. We both live in the same orphanage. She was at the orphanage before I came. So, she's my senior. He was abandoned by his parents since he was a child. I really hate the word mother, so usually I always hit the whiny kids who were calling out for their mother. But who knows since when, suddenly he said that she is my mother. You are crazy. The head of our orphanage is a little crazy and cruel. When Josee was 10 years old, he put insecticide in the head of the orphanage. Then the head of the orphanage is taken to the ER, and Josee runs away. No one knows where she's running away, It turns out that the grandmother hid Josee and took care of him until now. Then how did you and Josee get back in touch again? He sent me a greeting card on Christmas day There was no sender's name on the greeting card, the contents only said that ... Now that mom is in a comfortable place, you don't need to worry. 10 years later we meet again Yes, that is so. Everything is just past. He thought he had killed someone. So he's always been hiding all his life. You stupid. I told you it's all free. Where is there anything free in this world? My friend's aunt works in a social care institution, they will provide a comfortable life for grandma and Josee. Incidentally this year there is still a budget, if grandmother agrees then we can start next week. The system is not complicated, there's no need to use the name Nuna Josee if you don't want to because it can be in the name of your grandmother too. Think about it first It becomes a good opportunity for you I see a lot of cooking utensils in the kitchen, Are you good at cooking? I cook Eonni, sometime you have to make delicious dishes for me. [Eonni: nickname for older sister] Good. - Really tiring, huh? - No, there's not much I can do. Looks like this will be over in 3 days. Thank you for your kindness. Today everything will be finished. Hm. Are you reading a travel book? If you could travel far, where would you go? I do not have a place I want to visit. Is it true? Seriously? Yes I've visited all over the world Oh, I see. Which place do you like the most? Dangeul, Scotland The best whiskey maker What's this? - With this you can go anywhere you want. Which whiskey is the best from? I've tried it a few times Very beautiful You said, you've been here. When did I say something like that? Oh - The people here are local? - Yes. But why can't all of their faces be seen? Due to maintaining their privacy Excuse me, you have a guest. Soo Kyung said she wanted to visit, so I let her come. You said everything will be fine soon, huh? / Yes. There are quite a lot of rules here, so you can't just touch the items. At least we fixed the bathroom. All this thanks to Soo Kyung who always asked me for help for this improvement. It's not that bad here I visited here, because my aunt told me that Seonbae was here. The social workers here are all good people, including my aunt. I really thank you guys. The woman I saw earlier, she has a disability that you talked about before? He looks so young Can I come in? From now on, I hope you stop coming here What? I said, I want you to stop coming here Get some rest I'll come here again later. I hope ... Don't come here again. You look good with this tuxedo Not mine Whose is this? I borrowed it from the laundry near the house But this tuxedo sure looks good on you How was your job interview? Running smoothly? Yes, that is so. I'll work hard. - Oh, I see. So, are you going to Seoul next time? Yes, it is true. I plan to leave my current residence Seonbae ... We're not meant to be together, are we? I saw your coat was really cool Ah, this? I bought it cheap. - Good, huh? - Yes. thank you Looks like you need to pay more attention to shoes, because suits and clothes usually look the same. People who are really rich, usually pay more attention to shoe brands. This whiskey is limited edition. I got it hard. They don't sell this drink carelessly Good drinks that are drunk by good people too. Very enjoyable. By the way ... Seems like I have to find you another job. I'm scheduled to go to work tomorrow. Crazy. I want to ask you something, okay? Yes please. Do you have a problem with Professor Min Hye Seon? I have a close relationship with him, but the one who recommended Professor Min Hye Seon on this campus was also the director of that company. I don't know whether to talk about this to you or not It seems like Professor Min Hye Seon has spoken bad things about you to the company you are applying for It turned out to taste like this Hello? / Hello, how are you? Fine, how are you? Good - This is my daughter. - Come on and greet my friends She is very shy The house that we helped at that time, recently we always visit it Because the grandmother in the house has died, so we are more often to help and visit her. What? What's wrong with grandma? You don't know, do you? My grandmother passed away a month ago, because her body had been sick for a long time Now you can use a wheelchair inside the house, right? You must be very difficult because you have to live alone The people from the orphanage know that I don't like going out, They often visit me and help me, so I feel comfortable in that case, thank God How are you? Alright right? Now you have graduated from college? Have you got a job? Hm. To date ... I still have Grandma's cremation ashes Because I feel grandma is still around the yard If I say "Come on inside the house" Grandma will answer that our yard is very comfortable Don't tell stories like that, it's so sad Your face looks very pale and thin You have to eat regularly Your window is open ... Through the window a winter wind blew. Don't you feel cold? Want me to call up the social care people to correct your window? The condition of your door also looks damaged, you should repair it immediately so that you are more comfortable. Why do you always think that I live in discomfort? It really offended me What? Why do you have to pity someone like me? What do you mean? - / I told you that your presence really makes me uncomfortable. I really feel uncomfortable with your presence Your presence really makes me uncomfortable What ... do you mean by saying uncomfortable? / Even I begged you ... To not come here again, because your presence really makes me uncomfortable Didn't I beg you? Looks like you're in a bad mood, I'll come back later. No, don't come again. You don't need to come here anymore. / kyaaaa / Do not go ... Please. Please stay by my side.

Okay, that's fine. Even though the tiger crossed the forest boundary and came here ... I will not be afraid Why? Because it's on my side I dare not fight tigers In that case ... I will sacrifice myself to be eaten by the tiger first. You must be able to escape Yes, you can. Do you remember how your footsteps sounded when you walked to me? Now I am no longer afraid How was your test today? Smooth? I do not know I'm sure you will pass stage 1 Because I recommended you The company you applied for the first time, they honestly really like you But I didn't recommend you on purpose Why? I know the CEO very well and his personality is very ugly. Besides, you won't be able to work for long at that company. So I didn't recommend you to them on purpose. How are you? Alright right?

Fortunately, our office hours are the same. Yes, I was trying to get home early even though I felt bad about the other employees [Lee Young Seok & Choi Soo Kyeong] I also feel bad about having to get married in winter. Don't just get married? No, you have to. The sunshine here is very beautiful Even though it must be very cold outside Now, I'm fine Hm? Even though we think that the fish are imprisoned there, But in the eyes of the fish, it is we who are imprisoned Right now I still think that being imprisoned in his own world isn't a bad thing As long as we can be alone together, together Among all those fish, there will be happy fish, right? I'll be fine now I'm not lonely Even though you are not by my side anymore I will always assume that you will continue to be by my side Therefore ... I'm fine now Why are you saying nonsense like that? The flowers fell ... They fell in beautifully ... quietly and then die. - Josee - Bandung, 260121 Bandung, 260121
