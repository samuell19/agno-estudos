(slow paced music) (dogs barking) - Hi, we're here to see Mr. Banks. - You must Mr. And Mrs. Velasquez. - Yes, we're here to pick up Lucky. - Mr. Banks will be out in a moment. Have a seat please. Steven, could you find Mr. Banks and let him know his two o'clock appointment is here? - Yeah, I know just where to find him. - Hi buddy, how are you? - Mr. Banks, your two o'clock appointments here. - Yeah, they're here to pick up Lucky. - I know, I gave him a bath today. You think he knows? - Oh he sure does, look at that tail. Tell them I'll be there in a minute Steve. Well my friend, it's days like this that make it all worth it. (whining) Hey, hello my friends. You just give me a couple more days and I'll find you a place to live okay? Hopefully we can keep you all together. (indistinct chatter) (throat clearing) - Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me. All of you are headed off to Junior High. So this is the last time you'll walk these halls. I hope you've taken time to reflect on this. - I've done plenty of reflecting Mr. Thornhill. - Thank you Mary. With a few exceptions, I am very pleased with your test scores. It shows that you work very hard and that you took your last days here quite seriously. Very good. Better. Slightly better. Marginally the same. A little bit worse. Good work. The thought of having you repeat 6th grade was more than I could bear Mr. Collins. You got a D. Good. Thank you. Where's that been all year? Good. Alright folks, that's it. I hope your summer's excellent. (bell ringing) Bye. See ya dude. Thanks for coming. - Guys, video games at my house. They actually believe the vacations for them. (slow paced music) (melancholy music) - Leaving your door unlocked, that's a good idea. Do you have any food? Is that the Chinese takeout I brought over last Friday? Oh, that's gotta be rancid by now. It's been two months. Don't you think it's time to move on? Why don't we go out for dinner? - I'm having dinner. - Yeah, dinner, on me. Let's go. (slow paced music) - Whoa! A welcoming committee, very nice, thank you. - I did it daddy. - Whoa, this is great. And a little unexpected. You haven't done better than a C all year long. - Let's just say I was motivated. - Motivated? By what? - The puppy. You said that if I got an A on the final test you'd let me have a puppy. - Well, a promise is a promise right? Where's your mom? - She called about a half an hour ago. She won't be home til Sunday. - Well, you know what that means. - I already called. Pizza will be here in about 30 minutes. - [Dad] Excellent, what did you order? - Pepperoni and mushroom. (horns honking) (slow paced music) - So I'm on the number five T box-- - There's no better pair to the eighth. - Cute guys checking us out. - Checking you out. - Okay, so Brian left you at the altar, he's a jerk. But it's better to know now than like-- - Then when I really got attached to him? - Funny. I was thinking more along the lines of 20 years of unhappily ever after. - I just need a little more time, that's all. - What you need is someone to help you with all of this unrequited love. - What I need is to be left alone for a while. - Maybe you're right. But I've got an idea. - Why don't you adopt a puppy? - Oh no way. I work too much. - All the more reason to have a reason to come home. - I live in an apartment. - That allows pets. Come on, think about it. Somebody to greet you after the end of a long day. Unconditional love. Somebody to warm your feet in the winter time. - Unconditional love. I like that. (crickets chirping) - Man, we need to get a bigger pizza next time. - You ordered it. Alright, so you've been thinking about this for a long time. What is your big plan about getting a puppy? - Well, I'd like to go to Wayside Waifs tomorrow and look around. If I see a puppy I like, we can adopt it. That's much more responsible than buying one from a pet store. - Yes it is. Alright, I'll tell you what. We will go to Wayside Waifs tomorrow and look at puppies, but we're gonna have to wait til Sunday to make a decision. I don't wanna surprise your mom. - She'll let me have a puppy won't she? - Yeah, of course. But one surprise at a time, because I think the A on the test may very well make her faint. (giggling) (slow paced music) - I'm sorry you won't be around for my art show buddy. I am not looking forward to this Sunday. - Whoa, whoa, hold up! - You were here first. Do you want us to wait? - No, no, you go ahead. - Thanks. - Come on dad! - [Dad] Alright, I'm coming. - How may I help you. - Hi, well my daughter Mary here got an A on her final test yesterday, and I promised her a puppy. So here we are. - [Clerk] And you? - I'm thinking about adopting a dog or a cat. - Get a puppy. - I'll look at the dogs first. - Hi, I'm Cameron Banks. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Hi, Bill Carver, this is my daughter Mary and I think she has her heart set on a puppy. - I'm Cynthia Parker, I'm looking for a puppy too. - Well, you've come to the right place. Let's have a walk through the kennel. (dogs barking) Music to my ears. - You sure have a lot of dogs here. - A lot of cats too. I have to tell you, every animal brought to this facility becomes part of our family. - [Mary] What kind of dog are you looking for? - I don't know. I'm really not sure why I'm here. - You're here to adopt a dog and help out Wayside Waifs. They do great work. - I suppose so. - My dad brought me here because he promised me a puppy. If I got an A on my final test. I really think he didn't believe I could do it. - Where do you go to school? - Park Hill Elementary. At least until yesterday anyway. I'll be in 7th grade in the fall. Just so you know, I think my dad is getting me a puppy out of guilt. - [Cynthia] Guilt? - Yeah. My mom got a job earlier this year and they keep sending her out of town. I think dad feels bad about that. - We're gonna go look at some puppies. - Come on Mary, keep up. - Okay. - Wanna know why I'm adopting a dog? I was supposed to get married a couple months ago, but I was left at the altar. Do you know what that means? - No wedding cake. - My fiance left me and now I'm alone. - You need a puppy, let's go. - A liter of six. Beautiful yellow Labradors. Here they are. - Oh, wow, good call. We're not gonna have to go any further than this. What happened to the mother? - Well we can't save 'em all. - Honey, come here. - [Cynthia] Oh my. - [Mary] What did I tell you? - You're very lucky because these three, they won't last much longer. Somebody will adopt them very soon. - I want one of these puppies dad. - Yeah, I know, I figured as much. - [Mary] Which one do you want? - That one. - Oh that's Lexi. She likes to roll around on her back and have her tummy rubbed. - Oh I didn't choose the one you wanted did I? - Nope, I like the other girl. She's independent. - Tilly, well she's the runt. But as you can see, she's almost as big as her sister now. - I know what you said, but can we get her now? They won't last. - Oh honey... Well let me talk to Mr. Banks about it okay? Can I chat with you for a second? - Sure. - I'm not gonna be able to take Tilly home today. - Why not? - My dad won't make the decision until he's talked it over with my mom. - He sounds like a good father. - He's a great father. But I won't be happy if I lose out on Tilly just because he didn't want to surprise my mom. - You won't. I'm sure Mr. Banks won't let that happen. - What's gonna happen to that poor little guy? He'll be left all alone. - Not for long, I'm sure of that. (solemn music) - How ya holding up? - Not well. - Maybe you need a new dog? - I don't think so man. - I know it's a lot to ask but if there's any way you could hang on to Tilly til tomorrow evening. My wife doesn't know about the dog yet and I think she should know before I bring it home. - Well I'll do my best but they go pretty fast on the weekend. - Ready to make it official Mr. Banks. - You don't have to tell me. - Honey I'm sorry, I know there's a chance we could lose Tilly but-- - It's okay dad. Nice meeting you Mr. Banks. We will be back tomorrow. - And I bet you Tilly's here when you get here. - Thank you. - Mary! Hey, if you ever wanna know how Lexi's doing, just call my cellphone. - I will. Thanks Cynthia. - Bye. - Bye. - [Dad] You're not mad at me are ya? - [Mary] Dad, we both know nothing happens in this family without mom giving it the okay. Just because the puppies might be gone tomorrow, that doesn't change anything. - It does if Tilly's gone. I'd feel terrible if she's not there. - It's okay dad. - She'll be there. - [Mary] I hope so. (whining) - [Cynthia] What are you doing outside the car? - When you asked me to watch your puppy while you finished shopping, you didn't say anything about dog poop. - Where? - Well, let's just say that putting on your brakes is gonna be a risky proposition. You're a bad dog. (slow paced music) - Here. Put that in the front seat somewhere. - Are you sure you need all of that stuff? - Yes, I do. And since this little bundle of unconditional love was your idea, I suggest you help out. Well, help out. No messes in your new home. You getting hungry? You put some newspaper down in the kitchen and I'll go clean out the car. - Hey, I don't have all day to help you with Lexi. - Your idea! (whining) - You're just what the doctor ordered. Yes you are. (whining) (whining) - Does that puppy ever sleep? (whining) It stinks being alone doesn't it? Come on. But you're sleeping on the floor. Awe no, no, no. That's my bed. You're supposed to be sleeping on the floor. Oh Lexi. What am I gonna do with you? (slow paced music) - Here you go sweetie. - Oranges? - They're good for ya. Vitamin C, potassium, all that good stuff. (door slamming) - Mom's home! Mom, we weren't expecting you so early! Did you get me a present? - Present. Oh, look and see if there's something in there. I don't know. - You could of called me, I would of been happy to-- - I'm sorry, I didn't know the plane was gonna get in early. I didn't wanna wake you. - Welcome home. I'll get it. - [Mom] Thanks. - We were just sitting down to breakfast, do you want some? - No, coffee's fine. Maid have the day off? - I sliced those beautiful oranges for you. Go eat. - Anything good happen while I was away? An A, on the final test! Good girl! - I'll let daddy give you the rest of the story. - Okay Mr. Softy, what did you promise her? - A puppy. (slow paced music) - Mr. Andrews, I'm glad you had a chance to make it out today. As you know, the stone for Romulous, it was finished yesterday. And it was placed this morning. - I appreciate you taking care of this so quickly. - We were happy to do it. Especially since Romulous was one of our own. Now you can go out to the cemetery on your own, or I can have someone guide you. - I would just as soon go alone if you don't mind. - [Receptionist] Not at all. Just drive around back to the cemetery entrance and you can park there. If you ever need to talk, we're here. - Thank you. (slow paced music) - What's in the back? - Oh, Mr. Banks told me that there's a pet cemetery back there. (slow paced music) - It seems a shame to leave Bailey here all by himself. - Yeah, don't worry about Bailey. We'll find him a nice home soon enough. - If y'all don't mind, I'd like to tour the rest of the grounds while the paperwork is filled out. - Well we have a nice dog park out there. - Wonderful, I'll see you all in a few minutes. - Don't you want to take your dog to the car? - Of course mother, as soon as I tour the grounds. - I guess she doesn't like paperwork. (melancholy music) - I'd kinda like to be alone please. - I'm sorry. I was just here to adopt a puppy and you look so sad. - I got Romulous here. He was just a puppy then. - My name's Mary Carver. - Eric Andrews. - I'd like for you to follow me. - I'm not finished here yet. - Romulous will always be here for you to visit. I want you to come with me now. (perky music) (dogs barking) - Mary, I'm not ready to adopt another dog. - We're not here to look at dogs Mr. Andrews. This is just a shortcut. Mr. Banks. - Mary, there you are. Your parents are waiting for you in reception with your new puppy. Nice to see you Mr. Andrews. - Is there any way you could find out where our daughter is please? - Of course. - Thank you. (whining) - He's the last of the liter. - So this is Bailey. Can I take him home? - Oh I think that can be arranged. (perky music) - [Cynthia] No! - Mary, we gotta get going. - Sorry dad I was meddling. - Come on honey, let's go. - This is a very kind thing you're doing Mr. Andrews. - You can thank Mary Carver for that. - [Mom] So Mary, Tilly is your responsibility. You feed her, you wash her, you pick up after her. - [Mary] Sure thing mom. - [Mom] That goes for you too Mr. Softy. - It's a shame that Tilly won't ever get to play with Lexi and Bailey ever again. - Well, maybe we can get them all together again sometime. - Yeah. Maybe I can get them together. - [Dad] Bring it on. - Maybe we should get more veggies at the store. - Peppers were a good idea. - Yeah I like peppers. - Yeah. - Banana peppers of course. Maybe you can grow some. - What are you guys doing? - Hey sweetie. - Hey, hey, not near the food. - Yeah, yeah, no, no, you should be out of here. - Later. Yeah cute, okay the puppy's cute. - Told ya. - Yeah you're right. - And I think she likes her. - Yeah, but that puppy's gonna be a big dog pretty soon. - I know, I know. It'll be my problem. - Yeah. Especially when you have to mow. (giggling) - Okay Bailey, this is your new home. How about that? Here we have the kitchen, and we've got, that's a picture of Romulous. See Romulous? And right there, that was his last work. You wanna be a painter someday Bailey? Well this is home. Hey. That's my spot. (faint whining) - Mm mmm. No coffee for you. The last thing I need is for you to have more energy. Oh don't worry. I'll be back before you know it. No barking. You be a very good puppy and I'll see you tonight. (whining) I'll be home soon. - It's nice you don't have to go in til later today. - It's the least I deserve after having to work almost all weekend. - Yeah. - [Mary] Come on Tilly. - I didn't think she'd get up this early on her first day of summer vacation. - You'd have to pry her out of bed with a crowbar if this was a school day. - Yeah. Oh, I gotta go. Well, I'll pick up Mary later. Love you. - I love you too. - Where's daddy? - You just missed him. No feeding the puppy from the table. So what would you like for breakfast? - Cereal's fine. I'll get some in a minute. - Okay then, I'll get ready for work. - Can I watch myself today? I wanna show off Tilly. - Your father and I agreed it would be best if you stayed with your Aunt Karen. - But I'm going to be a 7th grader. And I don't need to be watched after school. - That's just for a few hours Mary. I don't want you to be by yourself all day long. It's not safe. - But how am I supposed to hang out with my friends if I'm with Aunt Karen all day? - It's just until your father comes to pick you up at 5:30. - Can I at least take Tilly? - I talked to your Aunt Karen last night, and she said it would be okay. - Come here Tilly. Come here. - [Mom] Don't feed the puppy from the table. - Hey buddy. What are you doing over there? This should be good for a while. - [Karen] Hi girls! - [Mom] Hi. - Oh my gosh! Look how cute! Ooh I want one. Oh and puppy breath. Hey, why don't you come in for a cup of coffee? - Oh Karen I'd love to but I've got a meeting at 11 o'clock. - Uh huh, you work too hard. - I've got some stuff I've got to catch up on. Bill said he'd be coming by around 5:30. - Yeah, maybe we could grab lunch sometime this week. - Maybe Wednesday we can have a girls lunch out, my treat. - Oh that sounds good. - Have a good day at work mom. - I will sweetie. You mind your Aunt Karen. Yeah, good luck with her. (laughing) Bill and I really appreciate this. I know it's an inconvenience. - Look, I work from home, you need a babysitter, there's no problem. - Well thanks, you're the best. - You bet, have a good day. - See you soon. Bye sweetie! - [Mary] Bye mom! - And I still think you work too hard. Look at what you're missing. You think I'm doing you the favor. So this is what an A on a test gets ya huh? - Nobody thought I could do it. But I did. - Well pick up the little fur ball and let's take it to the back to play. - [Mary] Her name's Tilly. - [Karen] Tilly. - [Mary] And she loves to run around. - [Karen] Hello Ms Tilly. (light music) - What do you think about matchmaking? - Well, I'm a big fan. I introduced your mother to her father. - Really? Where did they meet? - I knew your dad from work, and your mom had just broken up with her boyfriend. I threw a dinner party and viola! (giggling) - Could you tell? Was it love at first sight? - No, it was more annoyance at first sight. Your dad's such an outgoing person and your mom is more-- - Reserved? - Exactly. But, they started dating and six months later they were engaged. - Wow. I never knew that. Mom and dad don't talk much about how they met. In fact, lately, they don't talk much at all. - It's a hard time for both of them right now. Your mom wants to go to work, she doesn't wanna be gone so much. - I don't know why she has to work. - Well that's something you'll have to figure out when you get older. I am going to go get us some cookies for our lemonade. Then I want you to tell me about this matchmaker idea. - Okay Bailey, when Romulous did this it was an accident. Let's see what we can do on purpose. Artists do not lick other artists noses. That paint is water and vegetables colors, but it doesn't taste very good. Just walk through it. Okay. (whining) (horns honking) (faint knocking) - [Friend] Lunch? - I'm exhausted. - You have a long night? - Yes, cleaning up after Lexi. Then she sleeps on my head, then she barks at some plane flying overhead. - I told you it would be just like having a boyfriend, except for the barking and planes thing. So this is probably a bad time to ask, but how are the shoes? Ouch. You're not thinking about getting rid of her are you? - Not a chance. Last night when I was reading, she fell asleep right next to me. She was happy. And it felt so good to be needed. - Sounds great. How about lunch? I am starving. - Okay, well let's go someplace nice. Especially since you're buying. - I have to admit, that last thing you did was a good commentary on the frustration of the blank canvas. - Well I'm not sure about Eric, but Cynthia's single. I know that for sure. - What if Eric's already dating somebody? - I can find that out after I get his phone number. - And how are you going to get his phone number? - Easy. I call Mr. Banks at Wayside Waifs and tell him I want to set up a play date for Bailey and Tilly at their dog park. - What then? - Then I call Cynthia. She gave me her business card. And I set up a play date for Tilly and Lexi at the same time. Then, I let nature take its course. (laughing) - My gosh. Do you even know what that means? - No. But whenever anybody says it, people start kissing. - Close enough. - Let's call Mr. Banks now. (ringing) - Hello. - Mr. Banks, this is Mary Carver. I adopted a puppy there on Saturday. - Yes Mary, I remember. Is everything alright? - Everything's fine. I was just wondering if you could do me a slight favor. - Sure, what's that? - I'm trying to get a hold of Mr. Andrews. The man who adopted Bailey. Would you happen to have his phone number. - Hmm, well I do Mary, but I can't give that information out. - He doesn't give out that kind information. - Ask him to call Mr. Andrews and give him this number and have him call here. - I understand Mr. Banks. Could you perhaps give Mr. Andrews a call and ask him to call me? I just wanted to find out if he'd like to set up a play date for Tilly and Bailey at your dog park. - Mary that's a great idea. That's exactly what I'll do okay? - I'll be here all day. Thank you Mr. Banks. - Success? - He's making the call. - Yes! - [Mary] Come here Tilly, come here. - So you wanna call Cynthia now or wait? - I'll wait until Eric calls. If he says yes, then I'll call Cynthia. - Oi. This matchmaking stuff is much more complicated than when I set up your mom and dad. - We live in sophisticated times Aunt Karen. - Indeed darling. (laughing) (ringing) - Hello. (laughing) (ringing) - I think it's Mr. Andrews. Hello, this is Aunt Karen's house, Mary Carver speaking. - [Eric] This is Eric Andrews. Mr. Banks tells me you've got a plan to get our puppies together. Count me in. - That's great Mr. Andrews. What time is good for you? - [Eric] Tomorrow afternoon is great for me. Let me give you my number. - I already have it. Thanks Mr. Andrews. I'll call you later today, bye. - I tell ya, one of these days I'm gonna let you fix me up. - You are going to help me make a love connection. (ringing) - Who's this? Creative Designs, Cynthia Parker. - [Mary] Hi Cynthia, this is Mary Carver. I was just wondering... - [Dad] Did you have a good day at Aunt Karens? - [Mary] We sat in the back yard and drank lemonade while Tilly chased birds. - [Dad] Oh, sounds wonderful. - So, what do you want for dinner tonight? I thought I'd help mother make something nice. - Why don't we just pick up some takeout Chinese huh? - Mom's got to work late again doesn't she? - Yeah well, work comes first with your mom lately. We're just gonna have to get used to it. (perky music) - I can't wait til someone tries to set me up with a handsome boy. - Tomorrow you'll be playing with Tilly. Yes. - Get your rest buddy. Your sisters gonna run you ragged through that dog park. - Well, you got the plan in motion, now what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna let Tilly do most of the work. - I think she's ready. - Mr. Banks, this is my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen, this is Mr. Banks. He runs the place. - Hi Mr. Banks, so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about Wayside Waifs. - Cameron. - Cameron. - [Banks] Karen. - Karen. (giggling) - Did you convince Mr. Andrews to show up? - Yes I did. - [Banks] Oh great. - Why don't you show her around. - Oh I'd love that. - So would I. (slow paced music) - I miss my girls. - Am I late or are you early? - You sir, are right on time. Did you leave work early? - Actually I'm self-employed. I'm an artist. - An artist. How does that pay? - It depends. I've got a show coming up, so if I sell one painting, it should make my year. - And if you don't? - I always sell something. There's no use worrying about it. - Oh my goodness. Cynthia, I thought I told you to meet me here tomorrow. - I'm pretty sure you said today Mary. - Cynthia Parker, this is Eric Andrews. He adopted Bailey. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Oh look, Tilly needs me. - I get the impression this was a set-up. - Yeah, me too. - Jilted at the altar two months ago. I wanna have a date like I wanna have a root canal. - Out of work artist. My last girlfriend told me out of work artists don't date. That was two years ago. - Out of work artists? Sounds romantic. - Yeah. Til you have to pay the rent. - I'm gonna have to check my social calendar. I really thought I was meeting you here tomorrow. - You do that. - Time sure does fly when you spend it with nice people. - Thanks. - Mr. Banks, your six o'clock appointment is here. - [Banks] Okay, I'll be right there. - I'll be out with Mary if you'd like to join us after your meeting. - Actually I'd like that very much. - Okay. - I'll just be a few minutes. - I think Tilly missed her siblings. - I think so. - Hi. Hi, I'm Mary's Aunt Karen. - [Eric] I'm Eric Andrews. - Hi, nice to meet you. And you must be Cynthia Parker. - Yes. (giggling) - So you're in on this too? - Well, you see-- - It's okay Karen. We decided to go out to dinner. As friends first. - Lovely. - He's cute and he's an artist. - Out of work artist. - Kind of makes you tingly all over doesn't it? - It used to. Oh our little girl has such a good heart. - I'm so excited that you and Eric are going out to dinner this weekend. - [Cynthia] I think the puppies had fun too. - Are you? - Sorry it took so long. - It's no problem. - So you're gonna adopt a puppy? - Oh, I was kind of hoping you came out here for a different reason. - Really? Hmm, maybe we should discuss that over dinner. - Well that would be nice, thank you. - And then Tilly saw a squirrel and she chased it. But Lexi and Bailey were too scared. (laughing) (perky music) What were you and Mr. Banks talking about? - Well he's nice, we're gonna have dinner together. - But I was going to set you up with somebody. - Well Mary, I think you just did. - I guess I did! - Let's get your stuff and get you home. - Thanks for taking me to the dog park Aunt Karen. - You're welcome baby. You tell your daddy hi. - [Mary] I will. - Hi honey. - Daddy, you look terrible. - I guess I haven't been sleeping very well. - Is everything alright? - Everything's fine. Let's get something to eat huh? So, I bet you're hungry huh? I don't know what we got. I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind dinner out of a can. I didn't go shopping today. - Daddy, I'm going to be a teenager soon. You can tell me what's wrong. - I'm just worried I'm losing your mother. Oh sweetie. Let's just have pizza huh? Your mom and I got married relatively late in life. In our 30s. She had a great career, better than mine. - Did she quit because of me? - No, no. She quit because she had to travel too much and she wanted to be home with me. We never thought we could have children, then you were born. Our little miracle. And I thought your mom would always be happy. But she got tired of not working and always being at home. - I thought she liked being home? With us. - Oh no, she does. Just... Your mom's a very talented driven person. You might find this hard to understand but work is very rewarding to her. I don't know. Just lately I'm getting the feeling I'm, I might be losing her to that work. - Don't worry daddy, Tilly and I will make everything alright. I love you daddy. - I love you too sweetie. - Hey Mary, where you been all week? - Staying with my Aunt Karen. - Oh wow a puppy! - Be careful, she's not a furry football! - What's her name? - Tilly Elizabeth Carver. - [Boy] Where'd you get her? - Stop interrupting me. - Okay, from the top. - I've been staying at my Aunt Karen's this summer because my mom and dad both work. I name her Tilly Elizabeth because Tilly was her name when I got her and I love Queen Elizabeth the second. Not the first. And my dad got Tilly for me at Wayside Waifs. Because I got an A on Mr. Thornhill's final test. Oh shush Tilly. - Well I got that for passing. - It's nice to know that your parents reward mediocrity. - Yeah, that's me, mediocre. Hey, I'm having a pizza party tonight, you wanna come? - I've got a job. I'm puppy sitting tonight. - Women. - [Mom] I don't know why you said she could watch a bunch of puppies tonight. One puppy is enough trouble. - [Dad] They won't be that much more trouble. This is very important to Mary. - [Mom] You know Bill, I don't get that much time at home. All I ask for is a little peace and quiet on the weekend. - [Dad] Your time away from home is your decision. Don't blame us for going on and living our lives here. - [Mom] Forgive me for coming home and interfering with your happy home! - [Dad] That's not what I... - Hey honey, I thought you were out walking Tilly? - We got back in time to hear you and daddy fighting. I don't have to watch the puppies tonight. - Oh honey, you can watch as many puppies as you want. That's not what I was mad about. - Then why were you and daddy fighting? - I suppose I think that decisions are being made without me. - Mom, we can't stop doing things around here just because you're almost never here. - I didn't know you felt that way. So what does your father think? - He thinks he's losing you to your career. - And what do you think? - I think that you'd rather be in a meeting in Denver than having dinner with daddy and me. (melancholy music) - How do I look? - Not too desperate. It's a good look. - I used to have great shoes for this dress. - He's not picking you up here right? - Oh no, we're dropping our puppies off at Mary's. No use leaving Lexi here to tear up the place. - Oh, that's good, 'cause he might turn out to be a jerk. - Oh no. He is so handsome. And he's an artist. Nothing at all like old, what's his name. - Have a great time. Are you wearing that necklace? - The ladies love a close shave. (whining) What do you know? (dogs barking) (slow paced music) (faint sobbing) - [Cynthia] What's the matter Mary? - Nothing. I'm alright. - You can tell me. - My mom and dad have been fighting. He's been gone all day. - Oh sweetie. - Hello ladies. You look lovely Cynthia. - Where are you taking me? - An art gallery opening, and then dinner at a nice little place downtown. - Why don't we just have dinner? I don't want Mary to have to stay up too late watching the puppies. - [Eric] Dinner it is. - I'll be there in a second. Let me talk to Mary for a minute. - Okay, I'll get the puppies. - He's so nice. - If there's anything that we can do, just tell me. - Oh it's so boring. It's like you're going shopping for heavens sakes. Another one. Must have been a sale on these. I don't believe this. I love the color but obviously, I don't know. Sexier without being too sexy. Well the skirts too. When did I buy this? I don't even remember buying this. (creaking) - I didn't think you'd ever make it back. - Sorry honey. I just thought I would yell at myself instead of your mother. Where is she? - She went upstairs about two hours ago. I think she's asleep already. - You okay down here? - [Mary] Mm hmm. - I think I'll go check on her. - Okay. I've got some work to do. And I'm gonna need help from all of you. (perky music) - And we have some more! Oh my gosh. Do you think you need a new style here? This is the worst one. What am I gonna do? (ringing) Hello. - [Mary] Aunt Karen, it's Mary. - Hi. - [Mary] Do you have some time to talk? - Baby, could I call you tomorrow? Mr. Banks is on his way to take me out and I can't decide what to wear. (doorbell ringing) Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, there he is. What do I do? - [Mary] Answer the door, then excuse yourself. - Yeah. - [Mary] Put on your black dress with your black pumps. - Black dress. Okay that's just weird. Okay, alright, thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. - Hope she has a good time. (slow paced music) - Mary! I didn't think you'd be waiting up for us. Are we late? - Not at all. I just wanted the chance to talk with both of you. Alone. - Before I forget-- - Keep your money. I need you both to do me a favor instead. - Okay. - Mr. Banks, Mr. Banks. - Is everything okay, how's Tilly? - We're all fine Cameron. - I need to ask a favor of you Mr. Banks. - She wouldn't tell me anything. She just said it was important we came here. - Are you free this afternoon at 5:30? - Your last appointments at 4:30. - There ya go. - 5:30 at the dog park, see ya there. - I guess we'll see you at 5:30 Cameron. - You have a meeting with the Board of Directors at noon, Cameron. - Oh boy. - I feel like we're in school. - Yes. - Where did she get the easel and dry erase board? - I trust that everyone had a good time Saturday night? Well while you all were playing kissy-face, my mom and dad were fighting. And it's up to me to make sure they stay together. - How are we gonna do that? (marching music) - That's a lot of Xs and Os. - They're not hugs and kisses mister. This is the master plan. And it goes into effect at 1300 hours on Sunday. - 1300 is the same thing as one o'clock? - Correct. - Oh thank you. - This plan plays to everyones unique skills. Timing is everything. So remember when and where you need to be. As of now, this is day one of Operation Domestic Tranquility. - Do we get code names? - No code names. - Can't we have code names? - Guys. - Now let's get to work before the puppies get back. (typing) - That's all I want it to say, very simple. Just have it ready by Friday and I'll swing by and pick it up. Thanks. - What are you up to? - I'm doing the bidding of a 12-year-old. (light music) - Steven, I think if we get the lawn mowed by tomorrow maybe we can pick up the other stuff too. - Yes sir. - Yeah Steven, because nothing ruins a romantic picnic like a big pile of dog poop. - Yeah. (giggling) - Alright Aunt Karen, everything's ready. Time for phase two. Tell them to stand by. And tell them they're doing great. - [Narrator] So what are you gonna do about all this? - [Mom] I don't know. I love him so much, but we just don't talk anymore. - [Narrator] And how is Mary handling it? - I don't know, that what I don't know. She seems like such a grown up sometimes. She handles things so well, but she's just a little girl. I don't know how this is effecting her. She smiles through everything. I know she doesn't want to worry us. She seems to be doing alright. And I guess it's really good she has the puppy but... - Have you ever thought about counseling maybe for the whole family? - You know, you're probably right. That might be a good thing. - I gotta get home. I gotta feed the kids. Call me anytime. You know I'm here for you. - Thanks Carla. Mary. You wanna tell your father I'm getting ready to start lunch? And take the puppy with you. - [Mary] Sure mom. - Oh hey! Get away from the seed. (ringing) - Hello. - Hey sis. - Oh hi Karen, I've been meaning to call you. - Yeah, I know you're really busy but I've got some exciting news. I met somebody. - That's great, I can't wait to meet him. - Well actually, that's why I'm calling. I'd kind of like your opinion about him before you know, it gets too serious. - Well I've been kind of busy lately Karen. - No, I'm not gonna take no for an answer. You come over after church tomorrow and we'll go together. - [Mom] Alright. I'll be over around noon then. - Great, great. Thanks, I owe you one sis. Okay bye. Yes! Phase two is complete. Now it's up to Cameron. - Who was that? - Your Aunt Karen. She wants to have lunch with me tomorrow. You gonna help me with lunch today? Good. Come on. (bell ringing) - I mean the day is practically shot. Is two hours. I don't understand why Karen has to see you today. - She's my sister. She wants me to meet this man and it's the least I can do. Can you see if my keys are in there? Honey I'm sorry, I've gotta got meet Aunt Karen. - That's okay mom. - [Mom] Love you sweetie. - Love you. - I love you too. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Alright, have a good time. - Sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can okay? - Sure. - Five minutes. Hurry up, you're late! - Sorry, church was running late. All I can say is I hope this guy is worth it. - Oh he is. - [Mom] So, what makes him so special? (laughing) (dogs barking) - Less than an hour everybody! - Tilly. What are you doing? (ringing) Hello. It's for you. - Hello. - Mr. Carver, this is Cameron Banks from Wayside Waifs. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, but well I forgot to have you sign a few papers before you took Tilly. - I'll be happy to come by tomorrow after works Mr. Banks. Sign anything you need. Hey, I could bring Mary and Tilly. Let them play in the dog park. - Ah, I was hoping we could take care of it right away. You see, I have to file those papers first thing in the morning. - Okay, I guess we can come on over. See ya in a bit. What do you say we run over to Wayside Waifs? - I'll get my sweater. Phase three is complete Tilly. And right on schedule. - [Dad] I'll be in the car. - Okay! Let's do this thing. (slow perky music) - So, what are we doing here? - I want you to meet Cameron Banks. - And you met Cameron Banks here? - Yeah, when brought Mary over with Tilly to play in the dog park. - Hello Karen. - Hi. Cameron I'd like you to meet my sister Ellen. - Hello. - Pleasure to meet you. - We've met. - Why don't we walk over to the dog park. I have a little surprise. - A surprise. - How 'bout this? Why don't you have a seat here? Yeah? - Alright. - Okay. How 'bout some lemonade? - [Karen] Lemonade, wow! (slow paced music) - To us. To him. - [Karen] I'm into that. - I wish Bill would still do stuff like this. - What's going on with you and Bill? - I'm very glad you could make it. - Sure, you made it sound important so... - So why don't you drop Mary and Tilly off at the dog park and we can take care of business. - You got it. - I introduced you remember? Mary and I aren't just gonna stand by while the two of you drift apart. Excuse me a minute. She still loves you you big dope. - Hey. Did you do this? - No. I think we've been had. - Yeah, I guess we have. - Listen, I, I just want to be as important to you as your job. And I'm sorry. - And I just wanna be allowed to be successful without feeling guilty. - Tell you what, you always love us more than your work. I can live with that. - Deal. (clears throat) - Oh, very nice. - You did all this. (gentle music) - [Mom] We did okay. - [Dad] So you're okay with the puppy now? - Yeah, I'm okay with the puppy now. I'm okay with the puppy now. - You're not gonna go back to getting seeds now are ya? - But you're gonna stay away from my shoes aren't you? - No. - [Mom] Tilly's about to be famous. - [Dad] Can't wait to see this Eric. - My only regret is that this painting isn't gonna be part of my show. - Eric, we talked about this. - I know. So, without further ado, the Carver family painting. - It's wonderful! - Oh wow, it really is. That's great. - Hey, weren't Aunt Karen and Mr. Banks supposed to be here at the unveiling? - They may have been delayed. (piano solo) (gentle music)
