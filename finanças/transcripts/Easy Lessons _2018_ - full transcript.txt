We are sleeping. To dream? Our dream. We are dreaming. We are dreaming. Children's room. -Children are playing here. -Very good. I like this word: playing. -You do? -Yes, I like it very much. Kafiya, can you sing the Somali National Anthem? I never sang it. I don't know. Forgot the lines. I never tried singing in Somalia, but when my mother sang, I knew she is singing very well. Maybe I will be a singer, yes. I want to be a model, singer, guitar player, interpreter, doctor, manager. I also like that, "to be a manager". How do you say that in Hungarian? You can say it like this, using the word "manager". For example a hotel manager, I like that. Little elegant clothes. They just say: do this and this. Would be so good. Welcome with an open heart our new students. Accept and help each other. Hereby I open the school year of 2016-2017. The role of the House Rules. The House Rules are determining the procedures that ensure the lawful functioning of the institution by setting rules and norms which are agreed upon the organization of community life, the achievement of the objectives set out in the educational program, establish the internal rules of the institution which ensure the exercise of the individual and community rights, without weakening the work of the school. A based logarithm B is the exponent to which A raised produces B. Gosh, this is hard. Logarithm based on 5 x… Logarithm based on 5 x equals 25. It's the same, I understand this, but when it's written, I don't. Sine alpha equals, this is tangent alpha. Cosine, sine, and how this adds up. Did you learn that before? No? We also have probability analysis and coordinate geometry. We have a long way to go. Good. And they cut it up and cleaned it. Mr. Szabi, guess what, a mister came to chat with me. And was it good? He said that I need special education. And for that I wanted to kill him three times. Which subjects will be your final exams? Hungarian as a foreign language… -That will be your foreign language? -Yes. English, Maths, History and P.E. For example, this teacher who teaches history, I don't always understand him, because he speaks fast and loud, and he uses difficult words. He uses very difficult words. Even if he explains something, it's difficult, I don't… it's hard… I don't understand what he says, you know. And P.E. I have to… how do you say? Climb a rope? -Can you do it? -No. I never did sports at home. Did they show you how to hold yourself with your feet? Yes, they did, but I can't stretch myself, you know. My body is too heavy for me. I can't pull my own body up. You will be able to do it, you can learn it. I don't give a shit. I slept, I did the washing and the cleaning, and just sat down in front of the computer. You always have to mess with me when it's my turn. I can't hear it. Come on, turn up the volume! I hear the police is bringing Noémi back now. When I moved into the children's home, the other girls always asked me questions. "Kafiya, how come you look like this?" "Can I touch your hand?" "Can we touch your hair?" "Why you are so tan?" "Do you go to sunbed a lot?" I want to finish school this year, so I have to learn how to do sports. Nobody at home ever asked me to do sports, but here you have to, whether you're a girl or a boy. Better. Oh my God! This is so narrow. From next Wednesday starts the final exam prep course. On Wednesdays? That's right. But only from next week. There will be an oral part, I'll send you the 20 topics. Volleyball, handball, basketball and football. You'll have to choose one of these. -Do I like 'handball'? -No, volleyball. -It's probably the most difficult. -Really? You have to play up to 1.5 meters and do this 30 times. -Are you also going to be here? -No, I'll have Maths. Alright. Are we going to be here? Yes, we are. -Hello, Kafi. -Good morning. "Class teacher…" How do we say? You do know this word, right? A class teacher is… If I remember well, we didn't have a class teacher in Somalia. I don't think. Only subject teachers then? You can write that down as well. If you got a topic like "home and family" at the exam, what would you say? What kind of person is your mother? My mother is a very good person. I think without her, if she weren't there for us, I would not be how I am now, here. What does she look like? Tall… a bit big. Well-built. White, with big eyes. Not really white, but my mother's skin is a bit white. Is she fairer than you? -Yes, a lot. -But not like me? No, not like you, but African white, I think you can say that. And she has big eyes. Have you ever been in love? Yes. Yes? Not in Somalia, but here, yes. -Never when you were there? -In Somalia? I don't like Somali men. Because I saw my father, stepfather, uncles, anybody close to me… I hated men. Is Somalia an almost 100% Muslim country? Yes, a 100%. So, there are no Christians or other religions. If there are, they get killed. -They get killed? -Yes. Also if you turn into… What is the word? -If you convert to another religion. -Yes, if you convert, then also. Is it good for you that you can wear any kind of clothes now? Yes, very good. I really like to put on what I want. Not somebody telling me what to wear. Or what to do. If I want something, I do it. I'm not wearing a hijab because I don't want to. -Was this hard? -Yes. -To take it off? -I was afraid. Because this is a problem for other Somali people, a big problem, they don't like it. -Does your mother know? -No, she doesn't know. I don't know how to tell her this now. One-two-one-two. Look straight ahead, as if you were on a catwalk and had to move. A bit more dynamic, not so slow. That's it. Look at me, not that way. Not so nervously. I know counting makes it angular, but try it like this. As if you were walking. Your hands should graze your body. That's it. Don't forget this, it's always here. Let it graze, graze, graze… Alright. Next one. That's it. I took part in a photo shoot once, where they told me I look like Iman, the Somali supermodel. They think I'll be as famous as her one day. I remember, Mum, when you wanted to hear the Quran, you always called me, "Kafiya, read for me." And I read you sections from it. You loved my reading. It made you so happy when I went to the mosque. Outside it was still dark. I was the first to get up. I went into the kitchen, started a fire, put the kettle on, then went outside to get ready for the prayer. I prayed while the water was boiling, prepared the pancakes, started making them. I woke my siblings up. We heard the voice of the muezzin: "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar." You used to say, "My girl, Allah made you for me." It's not bad. This is from the outside. Yes. And from inside. Is this for adults? It is, we can't put you into children's swimming classes. I'll show you right away where it is. That one. You like that one? Not that one with the backstroke. Oh, yes. You need to go there ten times. -Twice? -Ten times. Does it mean I have to go ten times? One day, second day, next day? Yes, but you don't have to go every day. Let's say twice a week. I see. The girls always ask me why I stayed here. Actually, I just got stuck here. The others… they kept going, but I was tired. I didn't want to walk on, after being on the road for a year. I don't know… Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine, thanks. -How long have you been in here? -Five months. And for how long more? Next week is my relocation and then I'll go. To your mother, or where? To foster parents. It's sad. There she is. -She is here now! -Yes, she is. Bye! People often say, "Look at this girl. She is from Somalia, but doesn't look like a refugee. She looks happy and well-dressed. She can't have any problems. She looks like somebody who has everything." They have no idea that I have been raised never to show my feelings, even if something hurts me. I try to hide my feelings from the others. People are surprised that there is a sea back home and yet I can't swim. First I was afraid to go to the swimming hall. You almost have to be naked there, wearing panties and bikinis. But they told me not to be shy. "Can't you see? Everyone is wearing it." They don't let you in the water wearing trousers. Come on, Kafiya. You only need your goggles. You can leave those there. Come. Sit just down and put your feet in the water. That's it. Is it cold? Wash yourself, your face, your arms. Put one of your hands over here. That one. Go in slowly. Very good! Now there is a ledge, stand on it. It's very hard. Don't worry. -Everything alright? -My feet don't touch the ground. Put your feet on the ledge. Stand on it. -I got taller. -That's what I'm saying. Super! Now let's put on your goggles. Great. Alright? Now I would like you to blow a bubble. Put your mouth under the water, and blow a bubble. And now come out. Good, now put your nose in as well. Very good! The same again, with your eyes now. That's great. Let's stop here and do something different. Hold on to the wall the entire time. It was very good. You don't have to do it that long. You can stop sooner. Keep your arms straight. The aim is to lie on the water. Deep breath, head in. Stretch it. Stretch it. Great! Now your legs… straight! Give me your hand! Don't let go of the wall, darling, you ain't that good a swimmer yet. I just couldn't… Hold on to the edge. Were you afraid? Don't worry, I jump in for you in case of trouble. Too much water… Don't rush. One-two-three, four-five-six, Hands up, four-five-six, Now a whole circle and back. Back to your partner now and do the next circle. Two. Three. And one. Two. Third one. One-two-three, four-five-six Girls turning, four-five-six. One-two-three, four-five-six, and girls turning around. Two. Three. Four. And back. Two. Three. OK, thank you. You have lost a lot of weight. Really? I went up from 50 to 93 kilos that is a lot. -But you're not that heavy anymore. -I'm still 80 kilos. I'll crash you, my sweet! Look how he laughs. He likes you. Oh my God! Are you OK? Yes, I am fine. It's good to see your little baby. Let's go to smoke! I remember how much we used to love when it started raining. We were always begging you to let us wash the carpets. We carried them out into the garden, took the soap, got undressed and soaped the carpets completely. Sometimes we forgot about the washing and soaped ourselves instead, until we almost shivered from the cold, and our skin got almost white. I loved sliding on the soapy carpets with my sisters. You used to sit on the stairs and watch us. -You managed to put him to sleep? -Do what? -Put the baby to sleep? -Yes, I did. Well done. Get your homework ready then, Kafi. Anna! Look how she put him to sleep. He wants to sleep, but everyone is shouting. Oh my God! Not yet. Poor little one. Should I whisper? -That would be great. -I'm not sure I can do it. You have to read this and then what? Then answer these. -And where do you have to write? -Here, A, B, and C. These are the questions. "The Pick Salami from Szeged… is internationally… known." -There is a man here. -What man? -What does he look like? -Oh no! -Does he look frightening? -Yeah. That's uncle Laci then. Noémi! Noémi! Give me your mum's number quickly. 0670 99385. It's not enough. That's not enough. Two numbers are missing. -Then delete it. -I'll let Noémi go as well. What kind of salami? How do I read this? Pick? Mr. Szabi! Can I ask you a favor? I have to leave in 10 minutes. Could you make me two cigarettes from Kriszti's tobacco? Yes. "…he started to deal with…" "…the special…" Abigél! "…for example, even today…" Great, thanks a lot, bye. Mr. Szabi, can I make a phone call? Please, let us read this. Well, only I can hear it. Super! We are here. Mr. Szabi, can I ask you… Mr. Szabi is not here now. No, you're right, let's do this, Kafi. Do you know what a bowl is? It is a dish. It is probably just much bigger and probably made of steel, iron or aluminum. What does it have to do with you, you idiot? So that's how we play it now? Alright, no problem. As for Kafiya, she is going to be a bit more problematic. She has to take exams from every subject. She will take her grade 11's exams now, and what is uncertain is whether she can pass grade 12's subjects in April, 2017. I don't want to waste your time, but take for example the Jewish laws, a popular topic nowadays. I have no idea how Kafi can answer these questions. How can I give her four heavy topics like this? These are all quite important. The anti-Jewish laws are part of the final exam topics, as well as the causes of the outbreak of WWII. Or, put the following Hungarian prime ministers in chronological order. I can't give her easier questions, but she… No, and you are not even allowed to. Péter and Éva, I would like to ask you to please discuss the future with Kafiya, in case she fails the exams. Alright, Fatima should be here and she is. Gergő as well. Where are we now at, Kafi? Where are we discussing the relation of population and nationality? What is the name of the state? German… I don't know. The Aus-tro-Hunga-rian Mo-narchy. Monarchy. Repeat it. Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Who is the ruler of it? -Franz Joseph? -Exactly, thank you. Use your common sense. When do you move to another place, what has to happen to you? It's not that complicated. What makes somebody leave their home? You have to win the lottery. To go somewhere abroad? What kind of politics can be the reason? What kind of politics? -Assimilation. -Yes, politics of assimilation. Hungarians had a great national consciousness at that time. Great improvements were happening to the Hungarians. It's hard to understand now, but what did this trigger? It triggered the other nationalities around them to change. They told them: Have some balls like us, and join us! Come, assimilate, adopt the Hungarian values, consciousness, and thinking. Can't you see how good it is to be a Hungarian? I was sitting in front of the house. Mum, you came and sat down next to me. You looked at me and said, "Your father decided to sell you… to an old man. But I won't let it happen. You are my oldest daughter, and I want you to have a better life… than me." I started crying. You said you would help me and hide me so that I could escape. You put a nice dress and a hijab in my bag. Something I could wear if I go somewhere. You gave me money to hide in case I needed to buy something. Next morning you came to the car in which the human trafficker was sitting. You grabbed my hand and said, "My girl, we'll meet again one day. God willing. Be strong." "What did you like to sing?" "What are your memories of school?" "Learning languages." "Did you like languages?" "Did you like learning languages?" Sometimes I think it's good to be an adult now. Being a child was also good. Someone takes care of you, tells you what to do, how to do it. Is always there for you. That was very good. I'm a bit like my mother. Little bit. Or a lot. Not a little bit. Because she always did what she wanted. Never listened to anybody. Maybe I inherited everything from her. Maybe she'll understand that she gave birth to herself. I am like her, or she is like me. Do you think of her a lot? Yes, a lot. Yes. But it's not easy. What would you like? Have them here with me. I would do anything for that. All of them. I try to look as if everything is okay, like I can do everything, and I'm strong, but… the truth is that I'm not. Sometimes I'm very lonely, even if I have friends around me, and mates. But… Yeah… I think… If I could go back in time, I would have wanted things to be different. I would have not come alone, but with my family. That's how I would have started… Let's start. With this film, I would like to show you how my life is, how my ordinary days are. Sometimes I imagine having you here with me, all the places I would show you, the things we would do together, the places I would take you in the city. I'm afraid if you knew what I do, what my life has become, maybe you wouldn't even want to see it, nor me. I'm so afraid. If you knew what I do, what would you say? What would you tell me? What would happen? Would you despise me? Would you disown your own daughter? OK. You have great skin. Have you ever imagined me with a white boy? Yes, your daughter. I didn't dare tell you. I was afraid that if I told you, you would think I'm lost, I have been brainwashed, blindly following this white boy, and you would lose me because of him. OK, now turn towards me a bit! At first I was shy. I didn't dare to show how much I liked him. He is very open-minded and knows a lot about the world. That was good, it's beautiful. I admired him, but was too shy to tell him. Mum, you understand many things when you are here. I saw how much their God loves them. Their God tells them, "Don't be afraid, come to me, I know something hurts you, ask for it and I'll give it to you." I understood the message of their God. The only thing left is conversion. I decided to become a Christian. Not only because of my boyfriend, but because I believed his message is the right path. Let's put this on another plate, alright? Sorry. How about this? Fine, shall we eat? Yes, and I'll read this out loud. Dear Lord, thank you for tonight and for this food. Bless it and help us in learning too. Give Kafiya strength to do well in her History exam. In the name of Jesus, amen. Enjoy your meal. -I'll read this now. -And thanks for the Chinese food. You're welcome. If you hear about the history of Hungary during WWII, you will hear a lot about how much the country suffered during the war. But is it true that we were the last allies of Germany? Was there another alternative for us? Count Pál Teleki aimed for armed neutrality at the outbreak of the war. Let us leave this now, have a look at WWII and continue this later. -Alright. -Please read aloud what happened. -"The First World War…" -The Second. I wrote "the First". I'm so… whatever. "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The name of contract." -Was the name of this contract. -Contract name? -Was the name of this contract. -Yes, I know. What they signed. We wrote it there so you know its name. The British united, they were strong… They used a radar. Yes, they did. Germans couldn't beat that. But meanwhile Hitler was working on which plan? Barbara, Barbaros… The Operation Barbarossa. -Once again. -The Operation Barbarossa. -Which? -The Operation Barbarossa. Barbarossa, Barbarossa, Barbarossa. So once again, which three places were they at? Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev. Alli… alliances. -Alli… -Allies. Alli… ances… Ances? Allies? Yes, A-L-L-I-E-S. Let's repeat it five times. A-L-L-I-E-S. The problem is there are many words like this. No worries, we'll memorize it now. A-L-L-I-E-S. A-L-L-I-E-S. Perfect. Do you understand it? Is it clear? Yes. Let's take a short break, and continue with the Holocaust. Hi, Mum. Are you already here? We are on our way to Gellért Hill with the group. I know that conversion is the biggest sin for us. Hi. Hello. Good morning. Hello. Mum, you don't want me to go to hell, and you might think, as I'm no longer a Muslim, that I will go to hell. But what else could I do now? What should I do? Hi, Mum! Hello. -Aren't you cold? -No, I'm not. How are you? Was it easy to find the place? Yes. Aren't you cold? Let's start with a prayer. Dear Lord, I'm grateful for this day. Thank you for letting us be here now, and remember all the good you did for us. Thank you, Lord, for sacrificing yourself for us, and for your resurrection, showing that you are Lord over death, and that nothing is impossible for you. Thank you, God, for all of this, please keep on leading us on our way. God, you know the right path, you know which is the right religion of these two. You know I'm good and I don't want to go to hell. I want to repent my sins and pray. This is how I always pray to God, asking Him to show… the right path. He showed it to me, and I hope He will lead you to me. Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one. I don't like this, it's -4. I'm sorry. The Second… the First… World War. "During WWI, problem with the balance of the big powers… big states… problem with the balance of the big powers. The French are rivals… The French are rivals of the Germans, because the Germans occupied…" This is how the alliance had started, and the Entente Powers. My topic is: "Conflicts and power relations before WWI." Before WWI, was the industrial revolution. Every European country wanted new territories, and everyone went to occupy new territories. Germany, Russia, France, the UK, and Italy wanted the most to get new territories. They went to many places, like Africa, Asia, and went to European countries too. Come on, hurry up. Parents can also come in. You can move a bit forward so that the parents can also come in. -Now you know that no one bites. -Yes. Dávid László Balogh. Extreme results, but a successful final exam. Kafiya Mahdi Said. Amazing results. Knowing all I do about you, I wish you from the bottom of my heart lots of success in your future. The exam committee would like to compliment you especially for your English, P.E. and Hungarian exam results. Thank you very much. Fucking great. Me too! I didn't get any at lunch. But not on my hair! It is not up to me. Can I get some more? You know, the decision about you moving out has arrived. You will be transferred to an aftercare institution. We got the exact date now. On Monday. What?! Yes. -Are you serious? -I couldn't be more. I'm not going, I don't care. They have to come here, and take me away. So on Tuesday, I can't be here anymore? Now they organized a transport for Monday. They got a car for Monday for us to go there. What? Is this real now? We won't celebrate my birthday? It's my birthday now. When will I celebrate it? Today we will. I have to start packing now. Don't start packing now before your celebration. Why do they always do this? So suddenly? Always. Because you turn 18 tomorrow, the child protection services had to order your aftercare. They should have done it in November, but they did nothing. And now? They didn't do anything so far… The child protection services organize everything. By the time you turn 18 you have to move to aftercare. We can't do anything at this point anymore. When I go out from here, I'll take care of myself, now I know. What can I do? Happy Birthday! That isn't for real! Really? That's great! Thanks a lot, I love it. That's pretty cool. I hope you'll enjoy it. First I have to learn how to. I remember how you have been longing for this since you first arrived. Is this also mine? Thank you very much! Let's get this party started! When I left home, I hoped to return within a few years. I had no idea my life and my culture would change so much, that I wouldn't be able to return home anymore. Mum, I dream about you most of the time, and you are always mad at me, as you don't like the way I live and the people I make friends with. I'm afraid, if you knew I left my religion, you would hurt yourself, or commit suicide, because of the shame. Hi, Mum! -As-salamu alaykum! -Can you hear me, Mum? I'm fine, and how are you?
