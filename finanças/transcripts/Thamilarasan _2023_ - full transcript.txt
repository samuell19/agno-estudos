For many, sports is a hobby. But for me… Sports gave me life! I'm a cop. I was born into a regular family and lost my parents at a young age. I studied in a hostel and got employed as a cop through the sports quota. I got selected as the team captain this year. This is assistant commissioner, Rana. Captain of the Delhi team. I'm just an inspector of police in Tamil Nadu. But Rana is the deputy commissioner of police in Delhi. This match is an important one in my career! We have got to win this! --and he bowls a short ball. That's a good ball and he hits it! It is big but it should be taken! Is that going to be taken by the fielder down there? NO! THAT'S A SIX! This victory didn't affect me in any way. But this defeat deeply affected Rana. But… I didn't know it then. -What did you say? -I didn't say anything about you, sir! You're a big shot. What would I say? So, you'd hit me if I weren't your senior? -Sir, I didn't say that. -HIT ME! Hey, that's enough. Give me the phone. Eat your dosa. -Tamil? -We won, Leena! Yes, yes. I know. -Congratulations. -Hey! That's it? There's more! Go! Sorry, sir! I'm sorry. Sorry. Tamilarasan… Listen to me. Remember my face. Because I'm going to remember your face! Oh, you bloomed so soon! Dad! Dad! Dad! Nice catch, Dad! -Captain! -Dad? Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! Dad! Do you know what plant this is? What plant is it? This is a clover. Shall I tell you the meaning? -What meaning? -That means-- Let Dad go now. You can speak to him at night. Don't you have to go to school? Dad traveled a day to get home. He must be tired. You get ready. Tired? And me? You want to see? What are you doing? -You wanted to see, right? -Don't, our child's here. -How could you say-- -Let go, dear!

This has three leaves, yes? It isn't three. It's just a single leaf. This is called a clover. This is hope. This is love. -This is power. -Is it? Can I say something? This is Dad. This is Mom. And this is… You, my sweetheart! Hey! Are you only good for taking money? Don't you know you need to keep paying the interest? Should I come here for this? Padhu… There haven't been any collections this week. Give me two days-- You have until five in the evening! Have the money ready by then! -I'm off now! -A little-- -You called me? -Leave! Complain at the corporation office for water issues, instead of coming to a police station! Tamil, the city doesn't have water! Instead of going to the corporation, they-- -What's this and who were they? -That-- -How are you mixed up with them? -Why do you even ask? I was in a tight spot and took a loan at three percent! I'm unable to pay it back! -Who did you borrow from? -From her! To pay that back, I'm on a seven percent interest! -Who are you going to borrow that from? -That's from her too! -You're taking a loan from her to pay her back? -It's a good scheme. There are three! -Is this a lifestyle worth living? -No point abusing their lifestyle. I was talking about you. Not them. Tamil, that was uncalled for! Let this stay between us! Don't let our guys know! Padhu! Why did she have to insult me like that at the station? Wait and watch, you! I'll pay the interest and then deal with you! Who else is my scapegoat? What's this boss? Everyone worships an M.G.R. or Sivaji's photo. But you're different! Why do you worship M.R. Radha? -What's the reason? -Hey, Lakshmi Movies! 40 to 50 years ago, M.R. Radha came here for a shoot. He was sitting all alone, cutting an apple and eating it. My grandpa was staring at it intently. M.R. Radha caught him staring! He asked him if he'd like an apple! My grandpa rejected the apple and asked for the knife instead! M.R. Radha got pissed and gave him the knife! What did your grandpa do with the knife? He was sharpening it! Hey! He used this to waylay and rob people! My grandpa, my dad... We've been continuing this for ages! -[laughs] -Hey! But, boss… Your knife story is much more interesting than Murugadoss' Kaththi. Cigar Sundar? He won't suit this! Pimp Manikkam… is now a groom! Inform me if there is any news about me in the department! I'll take good care of you! -Hello! -There is a good news and bad news! Which do you want to hear first? -Tell me the good news. -Your dreams have come true! -What do you mean? -This morning at the commissioner's office, -Okay? -a list of the top ten rowdies were made. For the first time, your name is on the list. That too, in the tenth place! -Is everything okay, boss? -Hey! I'm in tenth place on the city's top ten list of rowdies. [cheering] Okay, what's the bad news? That is… Tonight… Tamilarasan… …will kill you in an encounter! HEY! What injustice is this? How can he kill me with others on the list! Shouldn't he start from the first on the list? What injustice is this? Sir, hello! Hello sir! I'm right, aren't I? -Tell me, sir! -That's… a revised list it seems! Revised list? -Before Tamilarasan kills you-- -Must I kill him? Nope. I'll share an account number. Deposit 10,000 into that account for passing on this information! I can't even pay back my petty loans here. Is the encounter confirmed boss? YAY! Rana… I didn't expect him to transfer to Chennai this soon. Now remember my face. Because I'm going to remember your face! What is the point? I know about Tamilarasan very well! He might turn up in any costume to catch me. -What costume would he choose? -You pest! He could come as a courier boy or a paper boy or as a milkman or as a shaman or in a Father's costume! Whose father, boss? Church Father costume! But whatever costume he chooses, we can easily identify him! How, boss? Because whatever costume he comes, his expression is the same! But we must remain alert! Got it? -Got it, boss! -That's it! [radio] Tamilarasan is on his way to catch them. Over. Cannot wait to use this replica! You've done a great job! Hard workers! Take the advance. Call me when you have the ten lakhs ready. -I'll come here to collect it! -[in Hindi] No, no. Police patrols are frequent here. I'll choose a good place and call you. -Okay? -[radio] Tamilarasan! Make sure you don't miss anyone! -Police! -We've got to arrest them by today! Over. [in Hindi] Go! Go! Oh, no! Oh, no! Boss! Boss! -What is it? -We're screwed! I've been screwed the day you two joined me! -Tell me! -Boss! Boss, when I went to buy some booze, he's coming to take care of you with six bullets and has now entered our area, boss! What? He's in with a gun? May he live a hundred years! We were just talking about him, boss! -How'd he come so soon? -Hey, bird head! If he comes here, I won't live to see tomorrow! Hey! How's he dressed? Boss! He's dressed like how cops usually do! He's dressed like a cop huh? Boss! Didn't you mention courier costume, Church father's costume, and some other nonsense? -He's in his police uniform! -HEY! When the cops are out to arrest a great don like me, it's a given they wear uniforms for self-defense! Understood! Without your bluffs, not a soul would respect you! Hey, with my photo in hand and a gun in his holster! Tamilarasan is here! Come on! Hey! He sprays pesticide in our area! Hey! He's coming through another route! Don't fall into the river fearing him! Hope he shoots your first before he shoots me! -Trail along-- -Get away, fool! [in Hindi] Faster! Run faster! Boss! What do we do now? Let's get a visa and settle down in Visakhapatnam! They don't give out visas for Visakhapatnam! Oh no, boss! They are catching up! I thought the city would run at my sight! But I'm on the run now! You're walking, not running. Now run before he shoots! Oh! He's here! Why are these China men running ahead of us? COME! [screaming] Your father wished that you would become a sportsperson. And here you are growing saplings in boxes! I'm definitely telling Dad when he comes home. That you're going to be a farmer and not a player! Hi, Captain. Look at this, Dad! Doesn't this sapling look great? It's my English teacher's birthday tomorrow. -And this is my gift for her. -Hey. Don't you have school tomorrow? Go to sleep now. Okay, mom. Listen, dear. Let go of all the tension once you enter the house. Especially… when it's our wedding day today. Absolutely no tension. Ban this. End this. [all] Ban this! End this! Ban this. End this. [all] Ban this! End this! Shut it down! Shut it down! [all] Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down Anandha Chemicals! Shut it down! Anandha Chemicals, down down! Anandha Chemicals, down down! Ban this. End this. [crowd protesting] Dear friends! We are at the crucial part of this protest. Approximately 20 kilometer radius around Manali Andalkuppam, Veechur, Velivayal… More than 20 villages are at risk and the people are dying a slow death due to the existence of Anandha Chemicals. The battle of the people started 15 years ago. Now, they've lost hope. Our fight for them may result in a solution! And ignite their hope! Shall we fight for them? We shall fight! Shall we? Dear students! This protest is just a tiny spark. Our fight continues till they close down entirely! -Anandha Chemicals? -Down down! -We want? -Justice! -Anandha Chemicals? -Down down! -We want? -Justice! -Shut it down! -Shut it down! Tamil, stop for a minute. Shut down Anandha Chemicals! I'll whack you! Didn't I ask you to stay at home and not go to college? I spoilt you. Didn't I tell you or not? Everyone at college is taking part. Why shouldn't I? So you're a hotshot-- I can't leave this halfway. -Go, Dad! -Hey. Hey! Revoke! Revoke! No, Tamil. This isn't right. If something happens to them… I cannot bear that. I told him very clearly last night. And now, he's part of the crowd. Let go, sir. He's fighting for a good cause. When will he participate in such activities if not now? I can sense something's fishy, Tamil. So the whole road is under control, right? Yes, sir. Sir? We've granted permission for the rally to come till the front gate of the factory. But, we're blocking them over here. Why? Why? You're asking me why? Sorry, sir. Do you know what this is? A sniper rifle gun, sir. But you know what makes it an AWM-338? Accuracy: International [imitates gunshot] Do you know what's the speed of the bullet? It's 1005 miles a second. Which is 1600 kilometers per second. It shoots an object accurately which is 2500 kms away. Okay sir, why now? We're going to shoot… an object. What object, sir? Arjun. Ban this! End this! The leader of this student protest. Because of this company, a total of 60,000 families… Around 3 lakhs of people have been affected. The air is poisonous. And full of chemical dust. The air is filled with nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, silicone. Our government wants to let the factory function smoothly. Without any interference. It's a 4,000 crore rupees project. This can't be shut down because of 400 whiny youth. We need to put a full stop to disruptions like these with the help of a bullet. Students will definitely break the barricade that we've made and will try to move forward. We shall start with a lathi charge, as per the rules. Our hero, Karthick's head will be hurt during the charge. The .338 bullet will pierce through Arjun's head that pierces through one side and comes out the other! That's it. All credits go to… [kisses] So, who's going to be the lucky one? Tamilarasan. Give a huge round of applause to this gentleman. I'm sorry, sir. I refuse this honor. You're not obeying your senior's order. Yes, sir. I know. I'm sorry for that. But, the respect I have for superior officer internally is much greater than the respect I have, externally. My superior officer resides in here. And it tells me not to pay heed to your words. Fine. But the superior officer within me says to immediately suspend you. Shall I go ahead? And it is not easy to come back again, Tamilarasan. You are… suspended. Come! -Where are you taking me, sir? -Come now! -I won't shoot him. -Shut up! And do what I say. Shut it down! Shut it down! [all] Shut it down! Shut it down! Sir, please! Do what I say. I'll talk to the crowd and ask them to disperse, sir. They will listen if I convince them. People send their children to college to study. Not to go on the roads and protest. These kids who don't how to shave, look at them protesting! Should we sit back and watch them? Is the government paying us for this? No, sir! The government pays us to provide them with protection. Not to kill them. Are you advising me? -No, sir. -Hold it! -Sir? -Hold this! Sir. Hold it. I said hold it! Ban this! End this! Now, Karthick's-- I want that student leader, Arjun! I want him dead! Shoot him. Now! Ban this! End this! Ban this! End this! Ban this! End this! Shoot. Ban this! End this! [protesting continues] -Sir, they've approached the barricade. -Okay, sir. Stop! Stop! Stop! Everybody out! Out! Out! Why are you blocking us over here? We've sought permission to protest outside of the factory. We received an order from the commissioner to halt it. The collector will be here any minute. You can hand in your petition. And leave. We aren't here to hand him a petition. We are here to protest in front of Anand Chemicals factory! Ask your collector to come meet us there. Hey. Do you think the collector is your pet dog? For you to order where he should meet you all? We are protesting within our limits! Leave us be. Go away. Get going! Disperse right away! [gun clicks] Bro! It's me. -Tamilarasan. -Tamil? Simply. Arjun! Look here! Students! Listen to what I say carefully. If you don't withdraw from this protest… Here your friend Vinoth's dad, Ganesh. I will kill him right away! -Dad! -Hey, Arjun! Take all of them back to college! The police have planned something devious. Listen to me! Arjun! This is your last warning. Everyone go back! If this was your dad, would you be quiet? Listen to me! There's a lot of media coverage. Think logically! I will count from 10 to 0. I will definitely push him down when I reach 0. The police are putting up an act. Hear me out! Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. [phone rings] Four. What is the plan now, sir? The plan is the same. Stick to it! Three. Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen. [groans] [gun fires] Charge! [piston firing] GOVERNMENT GENERAL HOSPITAL I humbly beg of you. Please don't bring up Nithya's name ever again! She's dead! From now on, you and her are no way connected to this! Please hear me out for a minute, sir. Go now. -Please, sir. -Listen now, go! -Hey. -Sir? Give us two ice creams. Two ice creams cost 100 rupees, sir. How dare you ask the police for cash? Do you have a permission letter from the Corporation? My owner will shout at me if I sell without taking cash. Only if we beat up your owner, he'll be okay. -Now, scram! -Please pay me! -Run now. -Yeah, scram! Ask him to meet us at the station. Now run! I need to show accounts to my owner, sir! I asked you to run! Sir? Thank you, sir! Sir? Sorry sir. Had we dispersed earlier when you warned, this would not have happened to Nithya. [phone rings] Don't you worry. -Hello? -Tamil? Nothing much. I spoke to the minister with the help of my brother-in-law. You don't worry, Tamil. Your suspension order will be canceled in a week! I wasn't worried about that though. I don't mind risking this job. They still went ahead no matter how much we tried not to. What kind of humans are they? Okay, forget all that. Where are you now? At the hospital. Who asked you to be there? Get out of there, first. The problem has just subsided. Are you trying to dig it up again? Do we really need this job, Tamil? To honest men like you the department doesn't do justice. I don't dream of our son being a doctor, an engineer or a businessman. I want him to be a good person. He has his world inside of him. A pure world. We just have to water it. And do it honestly with utmost care. We'll work elsewhere, Tamil. You could become a coach in your favorite sport, cricket. And I too, can go to work. Let's not choose a job that makes us die within, every day. Let's not choose a job that disrupts our peace and harmony. Do you really trust me, Leena? I trust you way more than you trust yourself. What, boss? Looks like your BP's rising? Why won't it? It's my life, after all. My BP's rising after seeing him. Hello. Weren't you in that room? Why did you come here? You go on rounds in and around the hospital. Did we ask you about that? Hey. You shouldn't have broken your head. But your mouth. Move away! How would you know about his antics? He roams around with a gun, carelessly. God knows when he'll shoot me. [gunshot] The 100 meters race for Std. V will begin shortly. Parents can leave them on the ground and go to the aisle… Run well, Captain! I will rock it, Dad! Ace this. Bring the cup home. I'll bring the cup home! Done. [commentary continues] Look how solid our Captain is! When I was his age, I ran the 100 meters race in 20 seconds! Let's see how long it takes for our Captain to finish. Five. Level up! [gunshot] The race has begun! Come on. Come on! [commentary continues] Come on. Come on. Come on! [breathes heavily] Captain! Hey. Prabha! Can someone bring some water? I can't feel the pulse. I can't figure it. Rush him to the hospital immediately. -Where's the emergency room? -Inside, sir. Prabha? -Where's the emergency room? -Inside to the right, sir. -Doctor? -Doctor? Doctor? -What happened? -Emergency, doctor. -What happened? -He stopped breathing, doctor. -What's the matter, doctor? -Oh, God! Pulse? Shock. Again. [breathes heavily] Okay. What happened, doctor? There is fluid formed around his lungs. We'll see what best could be done. They said the operation is possible. The treatment is going on, mom. I'll let you know. Hello, Mr. Abu Backer? Mom, one minute. I'll call you later. My name's Nambirajan. Everyone calls me Nambi. I won't let down those who trust in me. Here. This is my visiting card. Your father's name is Abdul. Aged 65. Your native place is Vadavoor, a village near Tindivanam. Your occupation is dealing with cement, gravel and steel. His blood group's O positive. It's been 15 days since admission. He needs an operation right away. It must be the grace of Allah who sent you here! Only you can save my dad. An immediate request for a heart will cost a fortune though! You don't worry about that. I'll sort that out. Okay then. -Assume your dad's deal is done! -Sir? I mean, left and gone back home safely. Another important thing, I'm keeping my word not because you said you'd take the risks. But because your dad's name is next on the list. In this hospital, listing the name is a priority than the transplant taking place. Don't worry. I will make arrangements in the next two days. Have a seat. Sit. And have juice. Order a juice for me and pay for it, too. -Hello? -Nambi? Are you free? -I am free. -There's a kidney available! Is it? At which hospital? Sarada's, Adyar. Will the work start when I come there? Yes, come. I'll be there in 10 minutes! Sorry, chief doctor. Sorry, doctor. What, oldie? Did you get piles? Hello? Yeah! I'm very busy. Sit. Have 2 crores ready in 2 minutes. Why did you come to this hospital? If you complain of a headache, they'd claim you have brain tumor and make you rest for 10 days! I couldn't think straight then, sir. He suddenly stopped breathing and talking. We came by auto. I asked the driver to take us to the nearest hospital. And he drove us here. Tamil. -Keep this. -No. It's okay, sir. You'd have other commitments. So what? Listen. Even if nothing's wrong with your child, they'd snatch a minimum of 10 grand here. So, keep it. Drink your coffee. Sister? I want to charge my phone. Where do I plug in? It's that way to the side. -That way? -Yes, madam. Poor thing's battery is dead. Let me ask her. Hello? Hello? Excuse me. Why won't you call me 'sister'? If you were my sister, I would have burned you alive! Mister! By the way, your name, please? -Sa… ra? -La! Sarala. Did you see the body? What? I mean, a body named Seedhakaathi. He's Seedhapathi and is deceased. He's on the corridor of the 4th floor. Um, what relation are you to him? -I want that bod-- -What? I want him! Hey. Stop flirting and get to work! Idiot. "To buy and sell" I'm Nambirajan. I empathize with your loss. But don't you lose heart now. Re-charge yourself. Sigh, how? I'm trying since morning but it isn't charging. Hope is the only way to live. Trust Nambirajan and you will not fail. If there's birth in this world, there will definitely be death. When night falls, there'll be light. Am I right, sir? You're too intelligent, ma'am! By the way… Did he save up any wealth? Or leave behind a huge amount of money? -Who, him? -Yeah. [shakes head] That's Seedhakaathi, right? Hmph. Even if he's dead, Seedhakaathi comes bearing cash. The wealth which he never earned when alive will now be earned in bounty post his death. I'll dive right into the matter. Eyes - checked. Liver - checked. I'll round it up to 50, okay? Bear with me, okay? Don't stare me to death. If you either burn or bury cases like these, no one can get into any trouble. This good man's eyes and liver are going to be useful for another person! Understood? Am I clear? Yeah. Understood, understood. Give me a round-up of 1! What? A round-up of 1? I thought you were a housewife. Your husband's lying dead in front of you and not one tear was shed! Could she be his mistress? [phone rings] Hello? Yes. Okay. You've come till 80, dear. Why can't you round it off to 1? I am giving, ma'am! Okay. Here's the 1. All okay? This is about another matter! This is our matter, from now on. The items are mine. Take care of it. I'll hand over a form. Sign it and you can go. Okay? [wails] My darling! My precious! My love! What will I do without you? [wails in unison] Let's not take him to our house. We'll take him to the ground and burn him. Stay quiet. Is this a hospital or something else? Everyone's screaming! Listen to me. This item is mine, whatsoever. Also, there was a woman seated here. Where is she? That was his wife. I handed her 1 lakh rupees. Give me his liver and his eyes. And do whatever you want to the rest of his body. Where is his wife? -His wife? -Then what, his pipe? But that's his cheek. Partner, I have a doubt. Does liver mean kidney? No, it means chutney! Are you all playing with me? My darling has pledged his organs to help someone's life! And you all are taking him for a ride? -Are you all crazy? -Hey. You're the one who's crazy! He lost his vision due to sugar, 2 years ago. His eyes are useless? Drowned in sadness, he drank till his liver failed. His liver too is useless? So I foolishly lost my cash? Captain? Captain? How are you feeling now? I can't talk, dad. Don't talk. Rest well, okay? Doctor, what are you observing? These are your son's vitals. In children, the normal pulse rate should be 80 and above. 75-80 is also okay. It shouldn't drop down to 60. And if it does, what will happen? If it drops below 60, it's a result of heart failure. [sad music] Prabha… [sobs] Prabha… [monitor beeping] Excuse me, sir? Greetings. Mr. Tamilarasan. I'm Ardhanaari. General Manager. -He's Mr. Gowthaman. -Greetings. Business Head. That's Dr. Padma Srinivasan. CEO of the hospital. -Greetings, doctor. -I hope you've heard… She was a Padma Bhushan awardee, last year. Oh. Mr. Tamilarasan. We're here to explain in detail about your son's condition. Doctor? You see… This is the heart of a normal boy. And this is your son's heart. Three times larger than the normal one. There are certain defects over here, here and here. And it's all very clear. Lights! Sorry, doctor. We're literate in Tamil. We read Dhina Thandhi. And repulse The Hindu. Can you explain in simple terms in Tamil? Okay let me explain, Mr. Tamilarasan. Your son's heart doesn't pump sufficient amount of blood. Hence, the fluids have deposited on his lungs. And have become heavy. You know what lungs are, right? Yeah, lungs. And uh… Yeah. That's the problem. So, what do we do? Do we fix this with a surgery? We've crossed that point. Your son's heart is now useless. We must change his heart. I mean, replace. He needs a transplant right away. Tamil… Heart transplant itself, is a very tedious process. And expensive too. Till then, keep him as comfortable as possible. -Okay? -I uh… What are you trying to say? I can't follow. We were with him all this while. He seems to be alright. He would appear to be fine. But his heart's condition is deteriorating. He would start to gain weight in a few weeks. He'd sleep for long hours. He'll go into insomnia and… …he will slowly slip away to death. I understand that it is hard to accept this. Like our CEO ma'am suggested, both of you could celebrate the last days of his life. What I mean is… Just say a better goodbye to him. Doctor… Without the surgery and without the transplant, how long will he live? A few weeks. May be a month. Doctor… I have a question. What would you do if it was your son? I'd choose transplant. Okay doctor, go ahead. Make sure his name is on the recipient's list, then. It's not so easy. There a lot of considerations done to get a name to the list. The cost of the transplantation is expensive for your level. That's why we have to think twice before we proceed. We can cover it using medical insurance. Leena, the papers are kept safe, right? Sir, excuse me. Medical insurance can't cover the cost of this surgery. How much have you insured for? Approximately 7-8 lakhs, doctor. This would cost at least 70 lakhs, sir. This is just the cost of heart transplantation. Then there's post-operative medical care to see to. That we will see. But, let me tell you clearly. Your medical insurance… I'm sorry, it cannot cover the cost of the surgery. Go ahead, doctor. Why are you looking like that? Tamil… They're saying the surgery alone costs 70 lakhs. If you could pay an initial amount of 25 lakhs, we could get him admitted and start the procedures. You could take care of the rest, later. What do you say, ma'am? From my side, I can give you a relaxation for about five lakhs. You can pay 20 lakhs for now. Poor thing. If we suddenly ask them to pay such a huge sum, it would be too much on them. Madam is being so kind. She's slashed five lakhs across the table for you. But we still have to pay it at the end, right? Yeah, that is there. At least 20 percent of your burden is being reduced, right? If we don't make the payment, you won't start the procedures, is it? When one chooses transplantation, there are certain rules we have to follow in our organization. I'm sorry, in a hospital. It's okay, doctor. Please continue. It means the same. My son's dying and here you are, betting against his life! What's happening, Tamil? Mrs. Tamilarasan. Please refrain from criticism in this room. Unless you make the down payment, we can't list your son. I'm sorry. Now the choice is yours. Mr. Tamilarasan? What have you decided? I am discharging my son. I'm going for a second opinion to another hospital. No, no. You're wrong, Mr. Tamilarasan. This hospital is renowned for heart transplants here! And it has been proven. Moreover, you have Dr. Murganandham here. He's one of the top three heart surgeons of India. I don't think you find another best option. Us paying the down payment is more important to you, right? Inclusive of the admission too. And to be included in the list! Sir, listen carefully. His pulse is dropping drastically. He won't be able to bear the procedure from the start again. Try to pay the advance soon. First, ensure his name is listed. Don't risk his life. I sincerely say this. It is up to you, then. Tamil… These two policies are worth five lakhs. I've only paid the premium for six months. I don't know how much we can get if we withdraw. Everything will be alright! Cheers! What would you like to drink? This sort of tame stuff won't suit me, sir. I need something strong to get me going. But money is a bigger addiction than this! [laughs] Anyway. It's a very confidential matter. Dr. Gowtham told us about you. [laughs] Madam? Madam! Mrs. Renuka! Minister's first wife. Hope the minister's second wife is doing well. She's the second! Then, is the first wife fine? Do you know the minister's matter? Is it Venkatraman sir's matter? Is it the heart matter? How do you know that? It's a very top secret matter! Sir, I'm like a robot. I scan for issues in one look. Without knowing these things, it's impossible to stay in business! [slurred] That's true [laughs] Oh, dear! Now you are looking for a heart. Lotus Hospital is next on the list. But, there are two patients preceding the minister! [slurred] You see Nambi, that lis-- [slurred] According to the list-- Tell him! We'll move his name up the list! But, you are too late, sir! I got three hearts last month! One was shipped to the Governor of California! One was shipped to my father in South Africa! -[slurred] Huh? - I sent it, sir! You should have paid an advance and booked it early! The minister is willing to pay any amount! Isn't it, madam? [nods] Hmm Looks like you've decided! I don't have any hearts now! I have a kidney though! Couldn't you use it? [slurred] At Lotus Hospital, we only replace a heart for a heart! [slurred] We can't shove a kidney in there! [slurred] Tell him! Mr. Nambi! [slurred] She'll tell! We're ready to give up to two crores! Don't say no! -Oh my goddess! -[slurred] Huh? Who? Blood group B positive! It's better if it's below thirty years of age! If you agree, fifty lakhs will be deposited into your account! Manmadha Raasa madam, include the GST too! [slurred] Brother! She's second in command! [slurred] It's true, sir! [mumbles] He's starting afresh! [slurred] He'll do it! [humming] Sangeetha ma-- Hello, madam! [mumbles] Did she hear it? [mumbles] I was speaking the truth! Why's she so upset? Okay What's going on? Where are we? -Ma'am-- -[slurred] Umm I'll tell her! I'm very clear! It's no longer a problem! [mumbles] Glenfiddich! [clears throat] Madam The… The pharma contract has been finalized at three thousand crores! -Okay -Rana sir and madam have guaranteed to get it done for us! So, we can admit the minister! Okay. Thank you. Cheers! [smiles] [hesitates] Captain! What movie was that? The one with the Vadivelu joke! "Achak! Machak! Pachak!" Pokkiri. Vadivelu, in the lift, says "What's this? Only the mouth seems to be moving, everything else is stuck!" [sobbing] Dad! [crying] -[crying] Dad! -[sobbing] Why did you leave us? Look here, doctor! He was talking to us till yesterday night! Pulse, BP were normal! Now you're saying he's had an arrest! It's not adding up, doctor! Something's wrong! I'm feeling suspicious! Didn't they run all the tests you asked? Didn't they pay all the bills on time? Look what's happened! It happens! We've done the best possible treatment for your father! If you have any doubts here are the medical records! If you want, you could cross-check them. Instead, you choose to make a scene in the ICU! Could you all step out? [sobbing] [crying] Dad! How much more do we need, Tamil? Eight lakhs. Oh no! Just two days left! How do we-- Hello, sir! My name is Nambirajan Everyone calls me "Nambi"! I won't let down those who trust in me. By the by This is my visiting card. "TO BUY AND SELL" NAMBIRAJAN ALL KINDS OF ORGAN ARRANGEMENTS AND ORGANISER What are you staring at, sir? This is just a part of my business! Otherwise, my main business is real estate. I heard the news. A huge ordeal at this young age! Oh my goddess! There's a four-year-old kid in Bihar! He had the same problem as your kid! His dad is a huge millionaire! What's the point of being rich? It's his fate! He couldn't save his kid! I heard about your matter! Is the name listed? Have you confirmed it? It's very important, sir! Because it takes time to be arranged then the heart has to arrive! It's a pain! Sir, what do you want? Sir, I'll be upfront with you! Please don't get upset! Madam, you too should listen! In these sort of critical operations the success rate is only 50-50! If it's a success, it's okay! What if it's a failure? All the money you've spent goes to waste! What's the point of blaming God and the doctor, later on? What say, madam? Would you call someone like that a human? The one who makes sacrifices is a true human! What I'm trying to say is… Your son, only the heart is weak, yes? Otherwise, his eyes, ears, nose and other organs are fine, right? If you waited… and the heart came in late! If something bad happened to your son! Other parts are fine, right? Tell me your price! We can negotiate-- Rascal! Oh no! Let him go! Stop it! Let him go! One more word from your mouth and none of your body parts will survive! Let go, Tamil! If I see you around this hospital! -I'll kill you! -I won't, sir! Sir! We've bought the minister to the hospital! Everything is under control. Over! Tamilarasan! What are you doing here? My son has been admitted to this hospital. Health minister has been shifted to this hospital! I'm on his protection duty! I'll call you! Here you go! Keep this as an advance! I'll give the rest during registration! It'll take another fifteen days! Thank you so much, sir! Sorry, brother! I can't stand to watch you like this! There are a lot of complaints against the hospital! My uncle's daughter, Janani! She works there! There's no doubt they milk patients for money! The breakfast for the chief minister was billed at seven hundred rupees by this gang! But, Dr.Muruganandam, has a good reputation! That's why you should continue your son's treatment there! Thousand rupees is enough to get his name on the list! There is a government cell called "Transtan" just for this! You don't need twenty lakhs! Why don't you talk about this clearly with her! Mr. Tamilarasan For your son's name to appear on the list you'll have to pay the government a thousand rupees only! But, where would you conduct the operation? You'll be conducting it here, yes? We've been clearly explaining this since day one! What you do is you deposit the advance amount of twenty lakhs! We'll ensure his name gets on the list! You said you'll pay today, right? Yes, sir! But I haven't got the full amount yet! I have the fifteen lakhs! Take this! Please ensure my son's name gets on the list! I'll try to arrange the rest within two days! Please sir! Mr. Tamilarasan! Please try to understand my position! Already our hospital is in the hot seat! The minister has been admitted here for treatment, sir! We're under extreme pressure to give him the best care! Being a police officer, don't you understand? They make you stand in the sun for a minister who'll come the next day! If I gave all this money wouldn't my son's name appear in the list? [stammering] Uh… Just… Menaka [stammers] Ardhanaari here! That C-block patient, Prabhakar! His parent is paying the advance today! -How much is it? -Fifteen lakhs. He'll be paying fifteen lakhs! Collect and keep it! He still needs to pay five lakhs! You'll be paying it tomorrow, right? -Right sir! -He'll pay it tomorrow! Yes! Then, we'll need to apply for his name to appear on the list! Get a receipt ready! Get all the papers ready! Okay! Mr. Tamilarasan I've pushed it back by a day with my influence! This is all I can do! I can't do anything else beyond this! Thank you, sir! I've been thinking lately, sir! God never plays around with human lives! Humans play with human lives! I don't understand! You wouldn't, doctor! You wouldn't understand Tamil. Sir, the guy who came in? Tamilarasan! His son needs a heart transplant! He's admitted here! His name isn't on the list yet, right? ♪ You are my only dream, my son Wake up!

How's captain doing? Our son's name is not on the list, Tamil! What are you blabbering? I'm not blabbering! We told them we'd pay the money yesterday, right? Yes, we've paid half the amount! We paid so his name would come up in the list! We'll pay the rest today somehow, Leena! Why is the list missing captain's name! They were waiting till 8 PM yesterday for you to pay! Since you never showed up they've moved the minister's name up in the list! If they get a heart today or tomorrow they'll transplant that to the minister! I've enquired fully, Tamil! It won't happen that way! I'll come there now! Hurry, Tamil! Tamil! Leena? [sobbing] I want our son alive, Tamil! I don't know what you'll do! Do something, please! Look here, doctor! He was talking to us till last night, Doctor! Pulse, BP were normal! Now you're saying he's had an arrest! It's not adding up, doctor! Something's wrong! I'm feeling suspicious! Your son, only the heart is weak, yes? Otherwise, his eyes, ears, nose and other organs are fine, right? If you waited then the heart has to arrive! If something bad happened to your son! Excuse me, doctor! Tamilarasan! My son's name is not on the list, doctor! What do you mean? They've included the minister's name, instead! As far as I know your son's name is first on the list! Only then is the minister's! Doctor, I don't understand this thing! How many lists are there in this hospital? My son's name is first on your list! In the hospital list, my son's name is not present, only the minister's name! [mumbles] Disgusting! You've paid the advance amount right? Doctor, I've paid half the amount! You had given me time for the rest, doctor! I'll pay it, doctor! My son's condition is deteriorating, doctor! His pulse rate is dropping, doctor! See! I can support you medically, in any way possible! But… Administration! I'm sorry! I can't interfere in those things! Doctor! One minute! Please! Listen to me-- You see… These are money-related concerns! And… If the list has already moved? I cannot do anything! Doctor! You are the department head, doctor! This hospital revolves around you! If you agree, it's possible doctor! Please, doctor! Administration can wait even a month, doctor! You know all too well, doctor! That's my captain My captain is on his death bed, Doctor! You don't seem to understand! For my patients, whenever I can, whatever I can do, I do it for them! But the final decision has to be taken by the board! Not me! I hope you understand what I'm saying! Doctor! You've performed around 300 heart surgeries, doctor! This! See this, doctor! How many faces! How beautiful they look! The joy on their faces! Doctor! If it costs twenty lakhs for an operation It's 220 crores for 300 operations, doctor! Last year, on the balance sheet you've shown a profit of 350 crores, doctor! Last year, the share value was just 420 rupees! Today, the same share costs 600 rupees! The total worth of your hospital is 5000 crores, doctor! A ten-year-old kid! Can you not operate on him? Have mercy on him, doctor! I'm not asking you to do it for free! I'll pay the money, even if it means certain death! Please, give me some time, doctor! Please, doctor! Hands off! Tamilarasan! Hands off! Doctor! Doctor, I'm not begging! I'll pay the money, doctor! Twenty lakhs! I don't know how! But, I'll definitely pay! I'll work night and day all my life to pay you, doctor! Trust my sincerity, doctor! Don't you understand, despite my repeated answers? Doctor! Hey! Ah! Doctor! I'm no longer going to ask. From now… you will listen to me alone! Not just you! This entire hospital. -Hello! -Oh, no. -Are you the security guard? -Yes, sir! Come inside! Get up, doctor. I'm sorry. Grab that chair. Sit, doctor. Take your seat. Tamilarasan… You're going to pay heavily for this. Just as I expected! Everything here is "pay" based! From now on, where to pay, and how much to pay… will be decided by me! -Do you have a gun? -No, sir. Turn around. Where is the central locking system for this room? It's in that box, sir! Go, open it! Nobody moves! I'll shoot for sure! How many doors are connected here? All the doors on this floor are connected to this. Lock it! I sent him to buy a tea and to check the balance of my account. Is he chatting away with the old lady nurse? If he comes back in five minutes, he's my man! -Else, he's the nurse's man! -Boss! -Boss! -He's my guy! We've been duped, boss! We've been duped! You're as old as a buffalo! Why'd you poop in your pants? -Go, wash up in the restroom! -Oh, boss! -Are you a fool? -Yes! I was saying you were duped! -Ouch! -Sorry! -What are you saying? -Lend me your ear. Didn't I tell you the other day, he'd come with a gun? -Where? -Over there! Go back to your place. Looks like he won't spare me! One thing. I'll say this once! Everyone must listen and do exactly as I say in one go. Or else… Everyone's in deep trouble! Okay? Take out your phones. Type in what I say! I am in danger. Please save me! I am also… Send this message to your parents, family, and friends. Forward it to everyone. I am in danger, please save me. I'm in trouble. Please save me! Please save me. Brother! Who, me? Come here. Use that tray and collect everyone's phones. -Okay. -Everyone hand over your phones to him. Take that bed pan! Are you crazy? He's got a gun and you're asking for a bed pan! I'm going to piss myself! Judging by his eagerness he might shoot without even aiming! Without hiding any cell phones, hand it over to him. Tamilarasan… I can understand how upset you are. But this isn't how you solve your issues. Thank you so much, doctor. So far, I've been following your route. It's been of no use. Finally… Just this once… I'm going to try it my way! Oh, another thing. Don't think you can play smart… …by talking me out of it. I asked you to remain seated there. Why'd you come here? Go! Sit down, doctor. I want you alive… to perform surgery on my son. Put the phones on the table. If someone has a hidden phone, please hand it over to him! He's going to shoot me anyway, He's a madman! I thought I'd be safe inside the hospital, but he's patrolling inside! -Greetings, sir! -Hello, sir! Go, check what he's up to! Boss! Boss! Boss! Fearing your escape he's locking all the doors! Why would I escape? I'm lying around wrapped in bandages! -Wha-what? -Poor fellow, boss! He's looking to kill you like an animal! What? He's decided to kill me? Are you a fool, boss? Looks like you'll reveal yourself to him! You seem to be aware of the situation. Draw the curtains, quickly! Quick, he might come any minute! Draw those curtains! Fast! Do you want me to talk to your father? I'll tell him your son loves me, get him married to me. What? Will he pull out a gun and shoot me? Are you a doctor? Hand over your phone and go inside. Bro! Bro! What happened, bro? Can I get you some water? -Tell me, bro! -What happened? Sir, I was waiting at a signal. A board fell on his head and broke it! I'm an auto rickshaw driver! I pitied him and brought him here. Let me go, sir! Tamilarasan... Every patient here needs emergency treatment. Please don't punish everyone for your misfortunes! They have to be attended. Immediately! Let them go. Treat them! You're a doctor, right? He's bleeding and fainted! You just stand there and watch? Treat him! Excuse me? As far as you're all concerned, I'm an extremist or a terrorist! OKAY? [phone rings] Treat them! -Hello? -Hello! Lotus hospital? But, madam, this is the emergency ward. -Please try another number. -This is an emergency, sir! -My son got electrocuted! -Madam! The emergency ward is under maintenance. Please try another hospital. Oh no, I'm almost there! Is there another hospital nearby? Madam, there is a military hospital at St. Thomas Mount. -Give that a try! -How do I get there? I'm near the bridge! Don't get on the bridge. -Take the service lane on the left! -Okay, sir! If you turned left there, you'll see a bridge get down the bridge and turn right and ask there! -It's nearby. -Thank you, sir! Sriramajayam! Sriramajayam! Sriramajayam! Sri… Rama… Jayam… Hi, sir! What are you doing? I work as the chief nurse in this hospital, sir. I meant, what were you doing under the table. I was writing Sriramajayam, sir! If I have any problems, I write Sriramajayam a thousand times! All my problems will be gone! Problem… Now… Now… Now… How many more to complete? Just a hundred, sir! Finish up quickly and join us! -There's work to be done. -Thank you, sir! Excuse me? Be seated when you write. Sit on a chair. Again, thank you, sir! Sriramajayam! AC sir, you know well that we aren't doing this for money. Of course… Performing the Central Minister's heart transplant brings credit to our hospital! But still, we are going really out of our way! I hope you understand. Thank you! Actually, sir. The only reason we accepted this was… As discussed, help us land this pharma contract. In fact, that's our only demand! We shouldn't call it a demand, it's our request. Would you like some sugar? Don't worry. It'll be done. Ma'am! Hey… Hey, baby! Where are we? Calm down, calm down! Nothing happened. Nothing… Hush! Hey… Who is he? Don't talk! Don't talk! -Who is he? A doctor? -Hey, hush! -Sir, please. -It's a gun! Hush! -He's got a… -Hush. It's okay! It's okay! Just chuck it! Hey. Where's the emergency ward camera? Camera number 27, sir. -I want the visuals of the emergency ward-- -Mr. Rana! Have a look at this monitor! Tamilarasan! Are there any alternative routes to that ward? Yes, sir. There's a lift behind that goes into the room directly. -You come with me. -Let's go! Dr. Muruganandam is stuck there! Oh, my God! Sir, someone's in the lift! Switch off the lift. It's impossible with someone inside, sir! [singing a popular Tamil song] Where are the lift controls? What the! It's stopped on the sixth floor! Has he shut down the power? I'll go and check! AC Sir! Our chief doctor, Muruganandam, has to be rescued at any cost! If possible, just kill him! Don't worry, madam. Today's going to be his last day! Hey, Shankar! Gowtham! Madam? I must drink some coffee immediately! Okay. You stay there, I'm coming. -Hey, do you have the access key? -No, sir! If we are to escape from Tamilarasan, we should leave this place. I'm going to meditate for ten minutes for that! -I can figure out the route only by meditating! -Okay Make sure no one disturbs me then. Take care of it! Do you understand? The stories I spin to catch a nap! All thanks to Tamilarasan! Commander! Guna! Has he killed him? -Hey -That Tamilarasan… -…killed him! -Shut up! They wrapped you up like a dead fish from Kasimedu. You were always ready for a war, my leader! Now they have you wrapped in a blanket! You said you'd lead Tamil Nadu into the light, my leader! Now you've become one with the light! -Hey… -Leader! You gave us work, but now you are lying jobless! -How long has it been? -Ten minutes. In ten minutes, my leader's body has began to stink! Why should I cry? Why should I cry? He lived like a lion! He hasn't left us penniless! We'll split it. We'll split everything! The flower market is yours! The fruit market is mine! Booze is yours! Drugs is mine! Devi is yours! Kala is mine! Then whose is Devi? You nincompoop! I napped for ten minutes and you've already assumed I'm dead! How did you split the territory! -Markets… Supermarkets… -Ouch! The hot news that's making waves across the country! The patient hostage crisis at Chennai's famous Lotus Hospital. The detailed number of hostages, patients and doctors and the details of the hijackers are unclear at the moment! The demands of the hijackers also remain mysterious! The police department is unsure of the answers to any of these questions! We will wait for all our questions to be answered. This is EVR, Sun News. -Good morning, sir! -Good morning! Well done, Mr. Mukilan! You always seem to arrive at the spot before the police! -What happened to the girl? -Which girl, sir? The one who got injured during the cross-fire at the rally! Was that a cross-fire? Straight firing, sir! The one who shot is roaming around freely, outside! Meanwhile Tamilarasan, who is innocent, has been suspended. You'll spend your life spinning stories like this! Good! Okay. If suppose I want to enter the main unit, then in case-- What's up, Rana? What's happening here? Is this a terrorist group? It's not a group, sir. It's a single man. And that is our Tamilarasan. The person you suspended from duty earlier? That Tamilarasan? -Yes, sir. -What does he want? -We don't know yet, sir. -Find that out first! What are you discussing, without knowing his motives? -Are you sure it's just him? -Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. I just arrived. I'll get all the details and call you. Thank you, ma'am! -Is there a phone inside? -Yes, sir. -Could you connect to it? -Yes, sir. Do it! [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello? I'm Sukumaran Nambiar. Chennai City Police commissioner. Am I speaking to Mr. Tamilarasan? Yes, sir. This is Tamilarasan speaking. -Thank you so much, sir. -[laughs] Why are you thanking me? I really meant it! For the first time ever, you've addressed a junior police officer respectfully with a "Mister"! You still think you're a police officer? Happy to hear that! I was worried you'd become a terrorist. Sorry, sir. At this very moment, I still see myself as a police officer. If you want, you could label me as a terrorist or an extremist. However you'd like to! The reality is, I'm a common man! Like a rat, traveling to the extremes, scared for its life, trying to hide and seek shelter. With nowhere left to run, I'm hitting back as a common man. Tamilarasan! Yes, sir. Tell me. You sound like a kind man! Despite your name making you sound rough. May I call you "Tamil" ? -Sir? -Tell me, Tamil! If you were in front of me now, I would've stripped my pants and shown you my back, sir. They've already finished me off at this hospital. I know all too well how cops think! I'll give you a name. Listen carefully. Padma Srinivasan. The CEO of this hospital. Meet her and talk to her. Tell her… My son's name should turn up on the important list. I'm giving you half an hour. Okay? Thanks! Tamilarasan, hello? Hello! Tamilarasan? -Sir! -The situation is dire here. It won't be wise to keep the health minister here with this crisis. He'll have to be shifted to some other hospital. Yes, sir. What's happening here in Tamil Nadu? The hospital in which the Central Health Minister, has been infiltrated by a terrorist! You stand by and let this happen? What's this, Mr. Rana? What do you plan to do now? The commissioner insists the health minister be shifted from here. -What? -Did the old man have to die for this? That old man… The old man, who was next on the list, died all of a sudden. Only then were we able to add the minister's name to the list. But if you want him shifted immediately… I-- I don't understand! Forget what the commissioner says. What do you say, Rana? Should we shift the minister from here? What do you say, madam? I don't understand! Seriously! You have to, ma'am! What you decide now, -determines our future moves! -Look. The surgery has been fixed at 9 PM in our operation theatre, for the minister's transplant! But, the doctor in charge, Dr. Muruganandam is stuck there! Bring him out! Then, I don't see any problem! -Are you sure? -Of course! Rana… What's your plan? Ma'am… This is against the commissioner's move. But as per your plan, the minister's surgery will take place at 9 PM here! How? Check! Your next move is, to meet the commissioner. My brother-in-law is a patient. He's stuck inside, sir. I don't know his current state. Who will I ask? Sir, my daughter and her husband… She's in labor. Her delivery is dated for today or tomorrow! -Tell us, sir! -What are your comments, sir? No. No. No. No comments. What do you have to say to this, sir? You have to answer this! No. No. No. Please. Please remain calm. I will talk about this later. Viewers of NH News, it is reported that the terrorist holding patients as hostages, has been identified as Tamilarasan. This news was brought to you exclusively by NH News Channel. He was five when he fainted at his play school rushed him to the hospital, doctor. Two doctors attended to him. Gave him medicines for three months. They didn't utter a word even then, doctor. Can I say something? Most of our doctors… are third-rated cheater fellows! Sorry, doctor. Not all. But most of them. And there's no hospital in my area which are a bunch of crooks in the name of doctors! WILL YOU PLEASE STOP THIS RUBBISH? Enough. I know the system's corrupted. Not just this hospital, it's common everywhere in the state. In today's world, virtues like love, compassion and patience don't mean anything significant anymore! Everything is money now. People go to extremes for money. You could ruin and kill someone. Doctor, being a pure profession, has now become corrupt. Doctors like me who avoid being corrupt are trying their level best on a daily basis. According to me, to save the life of a soul is paying penance for the sins of the hospital industry. When I perform a surgery, I cannot intervene with the management about the cost of it. But the amount I earn, I am aware of the amount of honesty that I receive in it. Don't misjudge all doctors by blindly judging a few. Even at this moment, the one who's threatening people at gunpoint is not a doctor! One who spits facts about the world, a person just like you all. A police officer! Hats off, sir. Hats off! I'm sorry, doctor. This feels like justice to me. It's nothing, madam. Give us some time. He's part of our department. He was suspended 4 days ago. I'm uncertain what's going on. Okay, madam. Okay, madam. Thank you. How dare they shift the minister discreetly in the night? Couldn't someone inform me? Some people even try to bomb the Prime Minister's place! What behavior is this? Tap into all the phone lines connected in and around here. Okay, sir. And then, the CEO of this hospital… What was her name? Excuse me, sir? -I'm Padma Srinivasan. -Oh. Hello. Hello. I wanted to meet you. Here. -Eat some. -[shakes head in refusal] I can't bear the pain, Selva! Bear the pain for a while. [cries in pain] -Is this your first child? -Yes, doctor. What gender are you expecting it to be? We are fine with either, sir. She's pregnant only now after 6 years of marriage. As long as the baby is born healthy, I am fine. Sister… The pain has become unbearable for her, sir. Can we take her inside to do a check up? -Okay. -Sir? If a situation arises where you need to relieve someone… can you please relieve my wife first, sir? Then what else? Why is it only your wife? If we go, we go together. Hey. How dare you say such a thing? How are your needs equal to hers? Look at this. What now? Hey. It's too much! -Take her. -Thanks a lot, sir! So, his son's name must be added to the recipient list. -Isn't that his demand? -Exactly. Then do that first. This whole thing is so simple. Are you kidding me? We've already listed the minister's name. How can I make last-minute changes to it? [laughs] You're the one who's kidding me now. It is Tamilarasan's son's name that should be on the list. At least that's what it says according to your log book. But, you malpractised and prioritized the minister's name. Now, you're scared of rectifying your mistake. Sir, who dares to refuse to operate a Central Minister? Even if I did list his son's name, there was no chance of them paying the whole fee. Do you know that they still have to pay four lakhs of the advance? There's enough time to pay up the dues. Sir, whose side are you on? I'm directly asking you. If a person like him threatens us with a knife or a gun, how will we work according to their demands? Of course! You can't. I'm asking you this based on the information you provided. Is the life of a 10 year old important to you? Or the life of the nation's Central Minister? This is the question we need to answer. Look, Mr. Commissioner. Death is inevitable in all our lives. Every day, we're forced to see at least one patient die here. A ten-year-old isn't supposed to die, is it? Please go visit a cancer ward or an AIDS ward. There'll be a six-month-old child battling for their life! See, when our birth is certain, our death is, too. Studying medicine or build hospitals aren't to stop death. But, to delay it for a while. That's all. Before, it was an act of service. Now, it's business. -[laughs] -And you know that very well. Anyway, The purpose of… wanting to meet with you was… to put an end to this mess. How? Could you come along with me? Thank you. When I see children suffering like this, my heart aches for them. What can I do? Don't you have a girl child of this age? And isn't she an adopted child? Mrs. Tamilarasan? Can I talk to you? In private? Nothing. You come along and I'll tell. Please come. This is all my fault. When the minister's name was listed instead of my son's, I spoke harshly to Tamil about this. I yelled at him to do something. But… How will… How is Tamilarasan's character, in general? -Is he… short-tempered? -No, no! It's really hard to see a man like him these days. He's too kind. In fact, I'm the short tempered one. He'd think twice to kill even an ant. That's why he keeps saying he'd resign his police job. The gun that he possesses, has 8 rounds of bullets. And he claims he won't hesitate to kill 8 people. If his behavior continues… not just him this will tarnish your whole family. Are you threatening me, sir? We have nothing left to lose in life, sir. If you oppose my husband, I won't even budge an inch. I'll always support my husband whatever he does. I'm sorry. Mrs. Tamilarasan? The decision to list your son's name as a recipient was made by the hospital administration. The total cost of the transplantation will be borne by us. Hey! -Thank you, madam! -It's okay! It's okay. Don't worry. Please lean back a bit. -[screams] -Relax… Sister? [landline rings] [doctors chattering] [landline continues ringing] [clicks] -Hello? -Yes, Mr. Tamilarasan. Like you asked, we could end this quickly. Can you do me a favor? Could you release at least two hostages? Why, sir? It's only to gain trust. Hear me out… Your son's name must be included in the recipient list, right? This matter cannot be decided by us. The hospital admin, State and Central Governments… there are many formalities to be done. And I'd have to meet with them. [woman screams] Which is why I asked you to release two hostages at least. Only then would you trust this pitiful commissioner! [groans heavily] Oh, God! Move! Stay calm. Sir, that lady is nearing her delivery! We cannot tend to her delivery at this ward, sir! Tamilarasan? Why are you silent? If we don't shift her to the maternity ward, we won't be able to save her, sir! Sir? Hello? [phone clicks] Why does he look suspicious? Hey! Salim! Salim, stop it! Boss! Boss! Boss! You've got a new job, boss! I applied for a Government job, years ago. Was it them? Then, I'm not going. It's not that, boss! Tamilarasan is whooping out a guy outside. If you could only step out, show them who's the boss! If he finds my face, he'd shoot me straight away! It seems like he isn't in the zone. Come, boss! If I get in the zone, he'll push me into a pit and you'll bury me with sand and flowers and presume me dead. -Shut up. -Boss! What about your Veeram (courage)? The movie, Veeram, was a hit! Vivegam was a double hit! And Viswasam was a blockbuster! Take the gun! You…! Take the gun! Shoot this terrorist! You…! Take the gun! Come closer! Shoot. Shoot. Shoot him! Come. Come faster and shoot him! You…! Come fast! [grunts] This is for abusing me every day for six months! [grunts] This is for forcing me to take drugs whenever you did! This is for running over a puppy even when I tried to stop you! [screams] This is for repeatedly cursing me! Just get lost, you moron! [whinces] [wails] Sir? -There's an incoming call. -Pass it. Hello? Now… I'm releasing one patient alone. He said that we can take her! We'll shift her now. -Thank God! -My mantras didn't go in vain! Come, ma'am. He's told you to leave. -Careful. careful. -If she's dizzy, ask her to sit. [screams] Selva! Selva, aren't you coming along? -You first go, dear. I'll come. -Selva, come! Please come! Listen to me, dear! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please send my husband along with me, sir! I want him beside me at the birth of our child, please! You. You. And you. Only the three of you can leave the premises. Thank you, sir. Dear? I will send your father and your sister later. The child and you can leave now. Go, dear. Thank you, sir! Commissioner sir! I'm sending three hostages outside. An infant and an unborn child. The total is five, including them. Am I clear, sir? Oh, another thing… I guess you're weak in making a note of the time. So, follow my orders strictly. From now, this very moment… …your countdown starts. My son's name should be listed within an hour. Otherwise, at the 61st minute, the bullets in my gun would talk. I'm seriously saying this. Now, -the ball is in… -in my court! I know. Thank you, Tamilarasan. What happened? A boy is crying all crawled up! And another boy is sitting and crying! Boss! That's not a boy but his lover! -Really? -Boss? His bulb… [whooshes] -His bulb is fused? -Yes, boss. What is this? She looks like a dumbbell kept aside. Excuse me? You seem tired. If you don't mind, care for a hot drink? As earlier reported, the battle between Tamilarasan and the police… Please bear with it a little, dear. Come this way. This way, please. …has released three hostages right now. Did Tamilarasan torture you when inside? You're wrong. He's a gem of a person! Very nice man. He's a very good man! Please help him save his son's life. That'll do. It comes from a local server and is on a private feed. It isn't through a cable but via the net. Can you share the URL to me? What? I'll make sure you don't get caught. What exactly is your plan? For how long do you plan on holding them hostage? [live news on TV runs] No clue, doctor. Brother, even if the name is listed, what will you do if there's a delay in finding a donor? I don't know, sir. My son shouldn't die. He won't die. And I won't let him die. What is this, sister? Lasix diuretic, ma'am It prevents buildup of fluid in the body. -And this? -This is Dopamine, ma'am. It controls the blood pressure. -Will he be alright? -Yes, ma'am. It helps the heart beat well. A while back, a sister finished all the doses. Why again? He needs to take this once in an hour. These are antibiotics, ma'am. -This? -It's a cardiology medicine. This could be for the pain. -Mom? -What is it doing to you, dear? It is doing something inside me, mom. Nothing, dear. You'll be alright. Sleep well. Why is he shaking his head? Okay, what happens now? We've overdosed him. The boy won't be able to handle the pressure of the medicines. His pulse rate will slowly decrease. Instead of being alive for two days, he'll die within a day! Unlike all of you, I don't believe in God. If there really was a God… A donor for my son would have been arranged already. Sir… Correct me if I'm wrong. We're now looking at this angle of the map on the screen. Over there, Tamilarasan will talk to us on that phone. That's a cordless phone. Straight to that phone, is an intercom on the table. That is located near the security's chair. This phone is connected to a fixed line. If Tamilarasan talks, he cannot move around with it. In this hall alone, there are eight centralized AC ducts. One of the ducts, is straight towards the phone, at a 90 degree angle. Okay… So? One guy with a sniper rifle can go inside that AC duct. If we could make up an excuse to get him to talk on this phone, we shoot him at point blank. Brilliant! But… How will we proceed without the Commissioner knowing? -We will use him as a pawn. -How? The people held hostage by Tamilarasan have praised him and asked that his demands be met. This has caused a lot of shock and surprise. What exactly are his demands? Why has he kept them hostage? His friend Ganesh is here to explain. Tamilarasan is just like everyone of us His son has a heart failure and is waiting for the operation! And they said they'll operate only after a certain payment! Not told. Blackmailed! That's why he sold all of his things! House, bike, everything. I was with him! Only his uniform was left. I don't know what happened here… You say 'one nation, one language, one religion' right? First, treat all humans as one. Respect them! Think of all lives as the same! Sir? What would you like to tell your friend Mr. Tamilarasan? Hey Tamilarasa! What you are doing is fair! We'll be with you. Thank you. Hello. Till I tell you, don't connect any of the emergency calls to the commissioner! Okay? Mukil, this is the circuit. Switch off the ones we need to. One minute, I'll be back. [phone rings] [phone rings] Check that URL. Hello. Tamil… Leena? Boss, listen to this. Hey, what is this?! Whoever talks on that phone - we can hear it! Breaking news! At Chennai Lotus Hospital, the conversation between Tamilarasan and his wife - You can listen to it now! Our son's name is in the list, Tamil! What are you saying, Leena? Yes, Tamil. It's done! Hey wait - that looks like our hospital! CEO Padma just handed over the official list! God… How's captain? Not so good, Tamil. [sobbing] Our son… He's slowly leaving us! We are at the last stage, Tamil! He's not our kid now, Tamil! He's God's child now! God sent him to us to keep us happy for a few years! [sobbing] No, Leena! Nothing will happen to Captain. Look. If the love I have for you is real… If the love we have for our son is real… -He won't leave us! Trust me! -Yes… Can I talk to him? It worked out, boss! Bro, what's this new channel? Ey! This is our hospital! Hospital eh! Prabha… Dad… Dad… Captain? Where are you, Dad? I'm right here, Captain! Closeby… Mom said you'll be here. Why didn't you come, Dad? I'll come, Captain. I've come for a small job. I'll finish and come. Mom was saying I'll get a new heart. Why? That… If you get a new heart, you'll become stronger. That's why. Dad… Yes, Captain? Am I going to die? [sobbing] No… No… Who said so? People don't die at young age, Captain. You need to sow seeds and it'll help grow a 1000 trees. And the thousand should turn into a lakh… Really, Dad? Yes! What will Mom and I do without you? What will Mom and I do without you… [gunshot sound] What is this?! Move, move! Who gave Rana an assignment like this?! Nobody did, sir! He is doing this on his own account. Sir, actually there is already a personal vengence between Rana and Tamilarasan. Viewers, you would've seen the footage we just telecasted. Tamilarasan, who had held people hostage, has now been shot by the police! Rana, the police who was sent to kill Tamilarasan, is still inside! What happened to Tamilarasan? What happened to Rana? What will the police and the hospital give as an explanation for all this? ♪ You have suffered enough Rise like a storm, it's time to fight! ♪ ♪ You've shed tears enough Let's end this oppression, come on! ♪ ♪ Can't we pave our own path? ♪ ♪ Don't we have law and order? ♪ ♪ As Justice and Honesty get abandoned ♪ ♪ Evil and treachery are championed! ♪ ♪ Law and Equity mourn! ♪ ♪ We've had enough We've had enough! ♪ ♪ We've suffered enough! ♪ ♪ All we want!

They are asking how the live feed is available to all channels. They are asking us to stop it somehow. Everything is done. I'm not going to get my son after all this. Brother his name is on the list, right? Then what? Does the list even matter, sir? They add him to the list. And then send someone to kill from the roof. These people won't save my son, sir. Doctor! Why don't we try LVAD? Wrong time! What does that mean doctor? What is he saying? LVAD. Left ventricular assist device. Why didn't you say this before? Will that save my son? It's only a temporary solution. Temporary solution eh? My son's life has now moved from hours to minutes, doctor. Sorry, Tamilarasan. Extremely sorry. Sometimes some small losses will lead to some big victories. As a father, your actions are one hundred percent right. [nods] Mmm. [crowd shouting] Commissioner sir! Do you know what we call your actions? Wet cloth - you know a wet cloth right? This is like slitting a throat with that. I don't get it. You said release three people and you'll talk to me, right?! But your son's name has been added to the list right, Tamilarasan? Then why did he come in to kill me? Ok, let me say this again. -Truse me! -Hmph! Trust! None of you have the right to even use the word 'trust'. Mr. Tamilarasan, you've misunderstood all of us! Think of this one thing! Even though you've caused to much trouble, your son's treatment has been going on smoothly! Your son is breathing till now! Don't you forget that! [crowd chanting] Lotus Hospital - down down! Lotus Hospital - down down! Don't be fooled by this shouting, Tamilarasan. This is just a crowd. Go ask this crowd to get your son a heart, not a single person there will help you! But if you want a unit of blood, there will be a thousand people to help! There is a price for everything in this world. Not everyone can buy anything they want. Or give anything they want. And that's the truth. As the CEO of this hospital I can pray for you. I can pray for your son. And I can ask the entire city to pray for you both. That's all I can do! I hope you can understand the reality. Thanks a lot, madam! One last thing. Just send my son to me. Some equipments, two surgeons and some medicines. It'll all be over in an hour. I'll surrender after that. All the patients, doctors in the city, that security Gopal, Rana sir, all the police here, you, media, all of you can go home. Ok, can! Again?! Yes, ma'am. We need to do it once every four hours. Who is prescribing these? Dr Muruganandam isn't here, right? Who are you sister? What are you doing here? Where are you taking my son? Sir, get that report. We have to immediately shift your son. Stretcher is ready, right? -Slow! -Carefully! Carefully! Make sure they sensors aren't disturbed! Take care of your child. Let's go! Come on! Quick! Come! Fast! Fast! Please hurry. -Please, doctor. -One minute. Only the medical team is allowed. -But I'm his mother! -We know, ma'am. Please try to understand. -But - -We will take care! There's no time! We will take care! Don't worry! C'mon! Hurry up! Excuse me, madam, please cooperate. Captain! Are you finding it hard to breathe? [whispers] Yes, Dad! Give me the chart! Tamil, could you… wait outside? Please, doctor! I'll stay here! No, I'll have to examine the patient in private! Please! Heavy electrolytic imbalance! What is happening in this hospital? Someone please tell me! -Mummy! -Hmm Where are they taking that boy? They are taking him to implant an LVAD! Won't he receive another heart? He'll get it. But, he's got to stay alive till then. But, we're getting a heart at our hospital today, right? Hmm Isn't it meant to be transplanted to him? But… the minister needs the heart before him! Compared to a common man… a minister is far more important, yes? There's a phrase in our religious texts. You could sacrifice a man for a family! For a village, a family! For a nation, a village can be sacrificed! This is just like that! You said, for the minister to live that boy's life can be sacrificed, right? Hmm What would you do if I were in that position? Tamil! Prabhakaran's pulse has dropped to the mid 40's. His BP is dropping! If we fix the LVAD now his heart can't withstand that load! For now, only a perfect transplant can save his life! Take mine, doctor! Oh Allah! Take my heart, doctor! Sir! Are you blabbering? After today's events and with my son at his deathbed do you think I'd still stay alive, doctor? Do you know what that means? You won't stay alive! But my son will stay alive, doctor! If the only option left to save my son is for me to die I'm ready for that, doctor! Tamil, it's not as easy as you think! What is the problem, doctor! Blood group matching, tissue matching coordination, compatibility! There are many issues to consider! If I did transplant your heart to him the body might just reject it! My son and I share the same blood group! B positive! My heart will suit him well, doctor! Be positive! Would someone inject 5 ml of fentanyl to him! Doctor! My son is just ten years old! He can't decide between what's right and what's wrong! As a father I have to make these decisions for him! My job in life is to keep him safe! You're still a young man, brother! You can have another child! Accept this as God's decision, brother! Tamilarasan! Thinking you can sacrifice your life to save your son's life is just madness! Do you think so, madam? I'm begging you! Save my son! Please save him doctor! Captain shouldn't die sir! Sir! My son should bury me! I shouldn't bury him, sir! Tamilarasan… I understand your feelings! If we did this, your son might live! But, it's completely unethical! What do you want us to do! Huh? [mumbles] Ethics! You don't understand, doctor! You don't understand who he is! You don't even understand what I'm trying to say! I will not let my son die! I know how to save him! If my son is to stay alive one person has to die! I'm a father. [gasps] I'll kill myself! Yes! I'll do it! Are you saying you're going to transplant his heart to his son? Doctor! Tamil and I might have our differences for that matter he could kill me here! But don't transplant his heart, doctor! Doctor! By performing this heart surgery are you going to ruin your entire career! What? WHAT? They'll ask me to leave this hospital! Else? They'll sack me from the medical council! That's it! Maximum? They'll ban me from practicing in India! That's it! Let them do it! My God! Doctor! Now you are fully stressed out! YES! I'M UNDER TERRIBLE STRESS! A doctor is a human too! 3000 kms on the other side of the globe! My family resides! I'm running a five star department all by myself! For a hospital that's two kilometers away I travel alone in my Benz worth two crores! Every Saturday night spent in some beach resort or some star hotel! Fully drunk! I party with girls 30 years younger than me! I do a lot of things! Come Sunday, I'll pretend nothing happened and I talk to my daughter and wife on Skype! This hospital treats me like a king! Why? Am I God? Had I not turned out as a heart surgeon! What if I had become a plumber? What would I do? I'd be putting up with pipes and valves! It's blood here! It's water there! That's the only difference! And! Mine is a bloody screwed-up life! This is a hospital! I'm a heart surgeon here! My patient needs a heart! In front of my eyes there is a heart! By taking it and transplanting it! I have a patient to save! That's my duty! And I'm doing it! Sir, may I talk to my son in private for five minutes! Everyone, please move out! Captain! Dad! Have you bought a new heart for me, dad? New… Just like the original one you have! Captain! What I'm about to say… Listen carefully! Okay? Your mother's advice you must always listen to! Because she's not just your mother… She's your best friend! Don't hide anything from mom! Family is everything! You! Your mother! Our family! Okay? Also, captain! Girls… Now… It's the age where girls would want to play with you! But… Remember when you play, they are growing up too! At that time, you should treat them with great respect! You should treat them like an angel! Because! Girls are truly angels! They are angels, captain! They are the true heart of any family! Okay? Then, Captain… Commitment. Commitment is very important! If you give your word! You should stick to it! You should never cheat anyone! You should never lie to anyone! To live in this world money is very important! It'll buy us many things! To earn it, you should become talented! Like Dad you shouldn't remain poor! Dad had… just dreams with him! That's not enough! All men will find one girl who'll truly love him! You'll run into someone like that! Don't let her go! Till the very end whatever happens! You should stand by her side! When you open your eyes dad will not be here. Don't look for me then! I'll be in your heart! I'll always be with you! I'll be watching all this! If you don't do this! It'll hurt dad! Doctor? Hmm? CEO Bye, Captain! Bye! [mumbles] What is this sir! So till now, he never had any bullets in the gun, eh? I never wanted to kill anyone here, doctor. In case someone has to die, then it should only be me. Tamilarasan! One minute. I'm sorry. I can't do this operation. Please! There is a risk with this attempt. One chance. Out of thousand. One in a lakh, even. When you shoot yourself, if your heart can't stand that shock there’s a chance of failure. What now? We have to keep your heart for your son, right? That's it right? Then… Lie down. Listen to me! I'll explain what's going to happen. Lie down. I'm going to put you into a deep sleep by administering anesthesia. You'll fall asleep in two minutes. Then, you won't know what happens to your body. Like taking a diamond out of a jewel box I will open your chest and transplant your heart to your son. Believe me. I'll keep my word! Commitment is important. Your dream and your son's dream… I won't spoil it. Promise! Thank you! Thank you for keeping faith in me. I don't know what you'll do! Do something, please! Sleep peacefully! Tamilarasan! Tamil Wake up… Just like you wanted we took your heart and transplanted it to your son. Functions are absolutely normal! Don't you want to see your son? Tamil! Tamil! Our son survived, Tamil! [sobs] Captain is back! Everything is okay and the heartbeat is good! We are back to our normal life, Tamil! We should thank the doctor! Doctor! CEO Doctor. Yes, ma'am. We got the heart. Um, two weeks ago during that Ananda Chemicals protest when the students agitated, the police shot a girl and she was serious, right? That girl passed away. Same blood group and no coagulation problem! I think… You can use that heart for the kid. Ma'am, what about the minister? I've decided I don't want that pharma contract. Thank you. Sometimes to save a good life we can sacrifice an entire village. Mummy! Thanks a lot, sir! I didn't do much! I just kept my word. This is your property. Keep it safe. From now on this is the government's property. Tamilarasan you've protected your son. And I need to protect the law. Please cooperate!
