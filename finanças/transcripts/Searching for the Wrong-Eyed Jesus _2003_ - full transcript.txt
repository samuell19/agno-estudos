And I resisted... the immensity of the South. I just resisted it because it's an overpowering culture. I desperately wanted to leave from the age of about 13. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. See that swamp there? I couldn't see the beauty in it. See, when you're growing up in this... seems like there's a blanket over the whole world. It feels like someone's - Like Gulliver, when he was traveling and the Lilliputians tied him down. You feel tied down. When I left the South... I'd get someplace like Amsterdam, Holland... or Tel Aviv, Israel... or someplace like that... and suddenly it'd smell like the South. Someone'd say somethin', or I'd see a tree... or some gentle moment would sneak up on me... and I would remember... the value of what I couldn't find when I was here. Until you've walked away from it, you can't see it. I decided, I gonna come on back to the South and... become a Southerner... as best I can. I will never be a Southerner. I'll be this imitation of a Southerner. But, in a way, I feel like that brings me closer to God. 'Cause I've chosen - It's almost like a form of divinity. I've chosen my divinity, rather than my divinity choosing me. Man, they got some good garbage here. I mean, they got some good stuff.

Came to everybody's mailbox in the South. I mean, everybody's. First thing that struck us was... everybody in the Sears, Roebuck catalog was perfect. Wasn't any bald heads. Everybody had all the fingers that was comin' to 'em. Nobody had any open and running sores on their bodies. But everybody we knew had a finger missin'... or one eye put out from a staple glancin' offa post. In other words, in our world everybody was maimed and mutilated... whereas everybody in the Sears, Roebuck world was perfect. And so we just started to tell stories about - We'd give 'em names.

You come pullin' into town... you see all the muffier shops and the strip joints... the cut-and-shoot bars. Then you work your way into the respectable realm of churches... and Main Street businesses. It's kind ofa crucible - the have and the have-mots. The have-nots run to the edges... and they bury their powerlessness... in the ritual of... sin. Well, hello! I love the small town. It's not even a halfa mile across the whole town. Very small. This way over here, we have the church. Over here we have a truck stop. Over here we have thejukejoint. Back behind me we have a prison. It's your typical Southern town. Whatever you grow up in... ifthere's generations upon generations that have grown up in that way before you... it sort of gets in your blood. I remember I had a cat one time, he'd never been out of the house. I was watching a TV show... and there was a chicken on the TV. This cat had never seen a chicken... but the chicken came on the TV and my cat... instinctually went into a stalk mode. Hejust looked at it. He had never seen a chicken, and he wanted to kill that thing. It was in his blood to kill that chicken. And in a small town like this, it's in your blood. You gotta either choosejesus or choose hell. You got your choice, and it's, uh - There's not a whole lot in-between.

The one on my back's a cover-up, and the other one on my back is a cover-up. And I got this one right here. This is a sister tattoo. There was another girl with onejust like this named Star... and we both had this one on us too. They were called sister tattoos.
