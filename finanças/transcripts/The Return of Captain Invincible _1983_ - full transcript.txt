--== McEphie ==-- (radio signal beeping) (energetic music) (brooding music) - [Charles] This is Charles Blackman, flashing to you "News On The March." Hidden cameras recorded this sensational scene of bootleggers in action. The mystery bigshot racketeer is in for a big surprise. Watch these mobsters closely, folks, because in a second the mighty hand of justice is going to deal them a blow they'll never forget. (bricks thudding) (suspenseful music) (group yelling) Yes, it's him, Captain Invincible, the Man of Magnet. The game's up for these bozos. The Captain, knowing our cameras would be there, gave us these exclusive shots of himself in action. Thanks, Cap. With you around, we know gangsters are living in fear. No one is immune from prosecution when the Legend in Leotards decides to strike. (water splashing) It's history, it's "News On The March." Captain Invincible, the hero of our day. - [Reporter] The Air Force released this sensational film of Captain Invincible in flight, on the way to an aerial encounter that Hitler and Germany will never forget. While Grand Fuhrer Hitler and an industrialist crony watch a rally, his planes are on blitzkrieg war path. (plane engine roaring) These Luftwaffe Nazis are killers in the sky. The following scenes, some of the most amazing footage filmed in the war so far, have been censored for security reasons. But one thing is for sure: the krauts will never forget the day the Man of Magnet read them the funnies. Give 'em hell, Cap. (suspenseful music) - [Pilot] Mein Gott! What is that? (speaking in German) - [Reporter] This Stuka is in for his last dive. These demons of destruction can terrify no more. And it's one more wall prize for the Captain. (artillery fires) (pilot speaking in German) (artillery firing) (pilot speaking in German) (pilot speaking in German) From the Atlantic to the Pacific, no Axis plane is safe from Invincible. See you later, Captain. We're glad you're on our side. It's auf Wiedersehen for Fritz! (upbeat music) "News On The March" cameras recorded Captain Invincible's recent visit to Camp Eisenhower. These pint-sized heroes are about to learn a few old tricks from their idol. - Let's see you do it. Rub as fast as you can. (wood rattling) (laughs) Watch this, now. I'll show you some speed. Get it in the hole. (wood rubbing) (group chattering) (fire crackling) (group cheering) (group clapping) Who's got the marshmallows, huh? So long, folks. - [Reporter] The Captain had some words of wisdom for kids everywhere. - What are you gonna be when you grow up, son? - I wanna be just like you, Captain. - Well, that just might not be possible. - Oh, well, I'll just have to be President of the United States. - A very fine ambition, lad. When you do get to be President, you can feel free to call on me anytime you like. Yessir, folks, as long as we keep on taking care of this country, this country will keep on taking care of us. (flesh hissing) - Hallelujah. - You can wave, now. - [Reporter] Keep up the good work, Cap. - [Michael] The country was stunned last week when Captain Invincible had to face accusations of disloyalty. The Captain showed his anger but millions asked themselves, what was this hearing really about? - [Senator] All we want is a simple answer. What were you, a presumably patriotic American, doing inside communist Russia on the date in question? - I'll be happy to tell you, Senator. I was wiping out the 3rd Panzer Division and two Waffen-SS units single-handedly. That's what I was doing. - [Senator] Very impressive. Just what motivated you to go and fight Stalin's battles for him? - What? What? - Senator, I object to your implication that my client was-- - [Senator] Captain Invincible, you admit that you're a premature anti-fascist. I think you're more than that. I notice you wear a red cape. What made you pick that particular color? - It might surprise you to know, Senator, that red, white, and blue are the colors of the flag of the United States of America, a country that you and I should both be proud to live in. - [Senator] Don't hide behind the flag, Captain. Answer the question. And while you're at it, why don't you tell us where you got that title Captain? According to my records, you never served a single day in the armed forces of this great nation. In just whose service are you captain, Captain? - Mr. Chairman, in view of the testimony of the effect that you receive no money whatsoever, I'd like to request that the committee now take action and ask the Justice Department to return an indictment for perjury. This will serve a double purpose. It'll also notify all future witnesses that they must tell the truth, and that we are serious. We've had too much experience with, met witnesses with very, very faulty memory. - [Michael] But the Captain walks out in disgust. (dramatic music) (group chattering) - What's your reaction to the charges? (camera clicks) - These charges are part of a government conspiracy against my client. - Conspiracy? - That's, that's what I said. For example, impersonating a military officer; flying without a pilot's license; wearing underwear in public. This whole thing is a, a tissue of lies designed to intimidate and demoralize my client. - Have they? (group chattering) - I'm sorry, what was that? - [Reporter] Is he demoralized? Is that why he wasn't at this morning's hearing? - No further questions. (dramatic music) - [Michael] America was astonished last week when Captain Invincible, under a cloud of allegations and charges, vanished. Where is the Captain? The familiar figure of the Legend in Leotards flying over Manhattan is no more, and this little kid isn't too happy about it. - Hello, America. This is Michael Lang reporting from Australia, where the wayward American Skylab Space Station has come to a fiery end. With me now is one of the locals. Sir, did you see Skylab when it fell? - Yes, I did. - You did. Would you mind just-- - I was flying through the air, and this en-enormous object come hur-hur-hurling at me at great speed. - Thank you very much. - I attempted to catch it. - Catch it, yes, good work, sir. - But it was going with such great speed. - Yes, sir, thank you. - That it threw me violently- - Thank. - To the earth. - Thank you very much. - And I was standing- - And that's all- - Beneath. - From Australia. - Nearly in rubble. - This is Michael Lang. - The size- - Signing off.

Washington wants to cut our secret development budget. So we will demonstrate the hypno-ray. I don't like this, but it's that or our jobs. We have to impress the top brass.

I wanna know what the hell's been happening here! - I concur. I wanna know what the, what the hell's been happening here. - Well, certainly not your routine robbery, but I still don't see why it poses a threat to national security. - It was used to, uh, to, uh, steal the, uh. - Not the hypno-ray. - I'm afraid so, Mr. President. - How effective is the hypno-ray? - The hypno-ray, as its name implies, is a device which reverses the normal relationship of brain to eye. By affecting the eye of the victim, his or her brain can be compelled to want or even desire any physical object. - Could they pull it to pieces and, and study it? I mean, uh, could they build another hypno-ray? - They could. - I concur. - I'll, I'll, uh, concur, uh, too, if you want me to. - Well, that means that we could have- - Uh, I concur, I- - A dozen hypno-rays, 50 hypno-rays. Oh, good Lord, whoever has that device could strike anywhere. - Nuke them. - Nuke who, dummy? We don't know who has the goddamn thing. - Cruise missile seek and pinpoint. - Pinpoint what? Pinpoint who? - This is obviously a Soviet mission. They have acquired the hypno-ray to turn all our agents around and use them against us. - Exactly. - I concur. - So do I, dammit. - I'll, I'll concur if you- - We're wasting time here.

After all, she found your man. - In the case of American personnel, dammit, the head of the FBI at least should be marching in there to give the son of a bitch his orders. - After all he's been through, no one should give him orders. No one can give him orders, but a friend can ask for his help. - That's you, right? You're his friend. - I intend to be, yes.

So you can tell whoever sent you here that I gave up the hero business a long time ago. - Well, you saved my life this morning.

And when you are you can feel free to call on me at any time. - There's something else. All those years ago when you signed that portrait, you touched me on the shoulder. (flesh hissing) And every since there's been a mark there. Sometimes it, it smarts a little. Here, see. Let me show it to you, just so you know I'm, I'm not kidding, all right?

He's says, uh, "magnet on" when he wants to use his magnetic ability. To fly he says, "Begin program." - As I understand that-- - No, he doesn't. He says, "Begin program," when he wants to use his amazing computer brain. - Right, we've got it straight at last. "Magnet on." Are you listening, Captain? - Yeah. - Good. "Magnet on" is for the magnetic ability. "Begin program" is for... - The, the, the amazing computer brain. - Right, you've got it. And to fly you yell out...? "Into the blue!" - Blue, blue. "Into the blue," stupid! - Good. Let's give it a go. - Okay. Here we go. Into the blue! (Captain Invincible grunts) - This is not gonna work. - Up!

Having you anything new to report? - Uh, yes, there have been unusual supplies delivered to the opera house this morning. - What do you mean unusual supplies? - A truck load of gym equipment, portable sauna, two wrestling mats, and a case of Dramamine. Since then every top cop in Sydney, both commonwealth and local, and U.S. military men have been in there. And that lady cop I was telling you about? She's with that slob that's been getting all the VIP treatment. - Would you be good enough to elaborate on the slob, Number 19? - [19] He looks familiar. He's probably one of those old has-been prize fighters. - And old fighter. (ominous music) I wonder. - So I'm supposed to call you a police person instead of a policewoman? - Yeah, that's right, it's neutral. - You mean neutered. Then the word becomes horsepersonship? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - That sort of joke's pretty tired these days. - Yeah? - I hope you're feeling hungry because I'm paying for dinner. - Okay, how about steak at Jack Dempsey's? - Where? - Or Lindy's or... Listen, this is a stupid question but where the hell are we? Uh, uh, is this Wall Street? Where is this? - [Patty] Sydney. Sydney, Australia. - Australia? That's where I've been all these years? No wonder the rats look so big, they were kangaroos. Ah. - Keep track of them, Number 19, and alert all operatives in the area. All good things must come to an end. Tea time for Jeremy. (teeth crunching) (door clicks) - Oh, what a great place. Makes me feel right at home. Where'd you get all this stuff? - [Patty] Oh, you know, flea markets, garage sales, junk shops. - (chuckles) No wonder I feel at home. - [Patty] How do you want your steak? - Uh, rare. - What do you want with it? Bean curd, sprouts? - [Captain Invincible] What's that? - It's too difficult to explain. How about french fries? - Perfect. What is this? Is this some kind of phonograph? - [Patty] Stereo. - Huh.

From there, Broadway soared to a height of activity in 1920's. (Captain Invincible chattering) Since then the number but not the quality of the theaters has gone into steady decline.

(hand thuds) (ominous music) (gun humming) (laser humming) Now, why don't you take another look at our homes. - I got to live here. - A down payment, (speaks in foreign language) no problem. You are going to live here. - We are going to live here. (upbeat drum music) (group chanting) - And we're going to go home and pack. - Reports from the housing developments are excellent, chief. All the sales figures have topped our expectations. Everything's going great! Except for... - Except for Captain Invincible. Exactly. I must say that his survival was rather surprising. Seems that his abilities have returned rather sooner than I expected. However, I can assure you that he will not escape the new trap that I have laid for him. I shall destroy Captain Invincible for the second time. (group laughing) - I don't understand why you're so certain. Oh, my God. - This is madness. Madness! We were meant to walk into this, Patty, which can only mean one thing: there's a traitor in your department. What is it? - Jane Fonda reading "Walden Pond." - God almighty. - They didn't stand a chance. And how could this of happened? Where are the security guards? How come? - [Dispatcher] Federal authorities have cordoned off areas. Wanted for questioning. Repeat, be on the lookout for Captain Invincible and female companion wanted for questioning. Wanted for questioning. - We've been set up, Patty. We've been framed! - Captain, I don't know how to explain all this yet, but I think you're being a little paranoid. - Paranoid, eh? - Hold it right there. - Come on, Patty! (wall thudding) (guns firing) (laughs) Faster than a speeding jet! They've found no way to stop him yet! - [Patty] There's only one thing, Captain. - What? - We're going straight into the water. - Into the blue! Into the blue, for Christ's sake! - May I make a suggestion? - Number One. Uh, calling Number One. - I trust for your sake that you have a favorable report. - It's fantastic. Because of the hypno-ray the occupancy rate of Sicily Heights is 98%. - Most impressive. (Mr. Midnight laughing) - Thanks to the hypno-ray we have achieved a 99% occupancy rate in Polish Palms. - Excellent! (laughs) (fingers snap) - Thanks to the hypno-ray we have achieved 100% occupancy rate in Afro Acres. - Excellent. (Mr. Midnight chuckles) - Do you know what you've done? Have you any idea? You've thrown my whole career out the window along with me. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. They would have believed my story. I'm not a washed-up drunk who pleaded the fifth in front of a-- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. (sighs) It's just that my career was just beginning. Had a policewoman of the month badge and three special commendations in the commissioner's own handwriting. - Well, I'm sure you deserved the commendations, kid, but I don't know if you would have deserved the ventilation hose you would have had all throughout your body if I didn't drag you out of there. - How can you be so sure? - Because I know who's behind this now. - Who? - Mr. Midnight. He's the only one who's smart enough to have engineered... (whistle blowing) He's the only person who could have engineered this thing. Stolen the hypno-ray, getting the whole world against me, it all makes sense now. - Mr. Midnight. - Yeah. My arch-enemy.

He's a juice head. A complete burnout. - Gentlemen, I have absolute faith in Captain Invincible. Your criticisms are premature and unwarranted. That is all. - Close down the sample home by noon tomorrow and have all the other villages do the same. You will then converge at the underground yacht basin and await the signal. Open wider, you silly boy. There. - The statue is 302 feet tall and a gift from the people of France. On its base are the famous words by the American Jewish poet Emma Lazarus. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." - Can we go up in the head? - Uh, no. You see, that observation platform was closed over 30 years ago by the government. Now we're coming up to Ellis Island soon where... (playful ominous music) - I can't wait much longer, Mr. President. - There is danger ahead. - What? - We cannot escape danger or the fear of it by crawling into bed and pulling the covers over our heads. - I won't let you down, Mr. President. I can't wait any longer, Mr. President. - Wake up, Vince. - Uh. Sorry about the mess, Patty. Truman used to send a girl in on Tuesdays, but you know how things are. - It's not that bad. - Sorry, did you say something? - No. - Okay. (hands clap) (computer beeping) - What are you doing? - I'm gonna find Midnight. Got a battery of long range sensing devices hooked up to terminals all over the country. Ike gave them to me. And when I plug myself in, I can literally feel what's going on from the mountains to the prairies. (button clicks) No, she's still not on. - The American Eagle Network. Captain, I hate to tell you this but that's not around anymore. - Don't say it, Patty. I don't want you to bury any more dreams of mine so just don't say it! - I'm sorry, but I have to tell you the truth about things that have changed. - Things haven't changed, Patty, people have changed. People and the whole damn country. It's lost something. It's lost something vital, like, like, like, like honesty and pride, integrity, and a sense of the future. I tell you, when that happens to a country, country goes right into the gutter. - [Patty] Well, you came back from there. Well, you did. - I'll tell you when this thing is over I'm gonna sit in that chair and just wait. - Wait for what? That radio to start working again? - Why not? See that? That's Albert Einstein. He was a close personal friend of mine, Patty. And he said to me once, he said. (Captain Invincible speaking in foreign language) Which means that the universe, Patty, and time it, it goes on, goes on forever all the way through to eternity, and, and folds in on itself in a kind of vortex, and then comes all the way back. Well, fine, I'm just gonna sit here and wait. Just gonna sit up here in Ms. Liberty and wait for 1950 to come around again. And with it Jack Dempsey, the Polo Grounds, the NBC Blue Network, Harry God Bless Him Truman, and maybe when hell freezes over some good old fashioned pride in this country. Okay, state of the union check. I'm gonna start west and work my way east. (machine humming) (computer beeping) (electricity crackling) (electricity popping) (machine whirring) (metal creaks) - You all right? - Yeah. - Did you find out where Midnight is? - I think so. (phone chiming) - Janice, I said no calls. Who? Well, my God, yes. Why didn't you tell me? Put him on. - Good morning, sir. - Oh, Captain Invincible. Well, it's great to hear your voice. - Thank you very much. Sir, I have information about the hypno-ray. - You do? - Midnight's got it, and I think I know where to find him. - You do? - Yeah. - Captain, now you're sure about this Mr. Midnight? - Mr. Midnight, yes. Right. Good. Terrific. Thank you, sir. (phone thuds) He doesn't believe me. I'm gonna get sold down the river just like last time. - He can't, he's your friend. - Maybe and maybe not. - I'm going to give him 24 hours. - Come on, Patty, we've got work to do. - A veritable feast of Thanksgiving on this the eve of a glorious new order. When the pure genetic Americans discover what I have done to clean up that rotting cesspool that they call New York, their gratitude to me will be boundless. They will carry me into the White House upon their shoulders. And our plan will spread throughout the entire land. Gentlemen, I give you a toast to Operation Ivory. In 24 hours, New York will be 100% pure. Alas, poor Schultz. I knew him well, Julius. (traffic humming) (horn honking) (group chattering) - Recognize that sign? They had one exactly like it outside the vacuum repair shop. - Coincidence? - Where Midnight is concerned, there is no coincidence. (group chattering) (silverware clanging) Hello. (silverware clanging) (group chattering) - That's right, Mrs. Newsbloom, Israeli Acres. But don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. But hurry, I hear they're almost all sold. - Yes, I will. Thank you, thank you. - Mention my name! Can I help you? - Yeah, I'd like a pastrami and a corned beef, please. - Right. - Both on rye. And uh, oh, anything else, honey? - A pint of Cole slaw and a half a pound of Nova. - And some matjes herring, and a little halva, and some information about Mr. Midnight. - Mister who? - You heard me. - Captain. - Listen to me, buddy, I've been in this shop 20 years, I ain't never heard of Mr. Midnight, or, or moonlight, or whatever. - Yes? Then why are you putting mayonnaise on a corned beef sandwich? - Be with you in a minute. - Duck! (gun firing) (glass shattering) (group screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) You don't know Midnight, eh? (gun firing) (glass shattering) (gun firing) (gun firing) There's no need for the gun, Patty, my powers are coming back. I can feel 'em surging through my body. I'll repel their bullets with my magnetic ability. Magnet on! (magnet humming) (knives clanging) (knives whooshing) (knives thudding) Repel, attract, I'll get it right in a minute.

But we can't get that shaft open. If it is a shaft. - Uh, you gotta do something. - Well, we're only human, unlike your friend. (laughs) Come on, you've got an appointment at headquarters. - I thought I was cleared. - Oh, you are. But if you wanna keep your badge, you better file a report that keeps my department out of this entire fiasco. - And what about Captain Invincible? - He's on his own.

Very appropriate. Go on. (Gustav speaking in foreign language) Unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected. Thank you, Gustav. You may go. Oh, of course. (Gustav speaking in foreign language) (Mr. Midnight speaks in foreign language) (metal thudding) (explosion booming) (group yelling) - You didn't think I'd make, did you? - Frankly, I didn't think that you'd make it into this century, my dear fellow. You're a walking anachronism, Captain. A paltry, puffed-up notion of a day long passed. An entity whose tickets to oblivion is about to be punched. (switch clicks) (door clanging) (snakes hissing) (Captain Invincible grunting) (Captain Invincible screams) (switch clicks) (door clanging) (alligator roaring) (triumphant music) (metal clanging) (pit thudding) - Well, that was really the pits. - Congratulations, Captain. It seems that some of your old skills have not entirely deserted you. - I don't need any compliments from you, Midnight. I want the hypno-ray and I want it now. - Same old dreary demands. Self-righteous, messianic, moralistic, and increasingly tedious. - Fine talk from a sociopath paranoid schizophrenic with delusions of grandeur. - Thank you. - You'll never change. - And you will never win. (fingers snap) (lid whooshing) Now let's see, during our long association you have, uh, changed brands quite a few times haven't you? To begin with, it was retsina, as I recall with just a little dash of hemlock. And then your long flirtation with cognac, during which you did rather overdo with Napoleon.

Pardon me for a moment, I have some business to attend to. Attention, submarine fleet. Assume attack formation and prepare to fire. Midnight One, your targets are Polish Palms and Israeli Acres. Midnight Two, you take out Sicily Heights and San Juan Sands. What you will shortly see in that terrarium miniature, you will also shortly see in reality. - [Computer] Commence attack, and have a nice day.

Although this has not been confirmed. (air blowing) Invincible vanished decades ago, and his astonishing reappearance stunned millions of New Yorkers. Stayed tuned for further developments, film at 11. - Patty, that was one terrific broadcast. - Nothing to it. Vince, all I had to do was get on your wavelength. - Well, you're on it. - We knew you'd come through for us. And don't be a stranger now. Let's have lunch together sometime. - Right, right, we'll keep in touch. - Yes. - Yeah. (President chuckles) (camera clicking) (triumphant music) (group chattering) (group cheering) (group clapping) I'm not a public speaker, or an expert, or anything, but there's something that I'd like to say. We've been through a great deal together. Now it isn't all your fault but some of it was. That's because a lot of us, including me, have been thinking we're all alone in the world, alone or part of some helpless little group. And that what's makes us such easy marks for the bad guys. But together we're not alone, we're not helpless. Together we're part of the roughest, toughest, biggest, kindest, fairest, best damn gang in the whole world.
