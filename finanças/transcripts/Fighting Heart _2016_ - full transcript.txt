LEWIS: I'm sure that isn't true. Hey, you coming to the fight in a couple of weeks? SUZANNE: Mmm, I wouldn't miss it. I've seen all the posters going up around. Are you getting nervous? LEWIS: No, not yet. The nerves normally kick in when I'm there. Sitting in that changing room, hearing the crowd sort of builds the adrenaline. Ah, I still get butterflies. SUZANNE: You'll be fine.

LEWIS: See you later. RICK: Woah woah woah! Is that it? No friendly chit chat? Your manners have gone to shit. How about a pick me up? Something to take the edge off? At a boy. SOPHIE: Oh, Carla. It's so beautiful. CARLA: Thank you. SOPHIE: I still can't believe you chose it yourself. LEWIS: Hey! Give me some credit. I know I'm a bloke, but I've got some taste. GARY: You sure I can't tempt you mate? LEWIS: No thanks, Gary. GARY: Ah, got to think about the diet. Last time we got you drunk, it wasn't your misses gave us the ear bashing, it was Tyler. LEWIS: You know what he's like. He's a bit over protective but his hearts in the right place. GARY: Right, I'm going for a fag. Come and join me Lewis, save you from all the girly wedding talk. LEWIS: Cheers buddy. CARLA: Typical men. SOPHIE: Well it's fine by me. With them out of the way we can talk about something far more interesting. The hen night. GARY: So, this is a bit out the blue isn't it mate? Don't get me wrong, I'm over the moon for you. But when did you decide this? Mr I'm never gonna get married. LEWIS: I've been thinking about it for months. Believe me, I never thought I'd get married either. But the more I thought about it, The more I realised it's what I wanted. My heart belongs to Carla. GARY: I've never seen you so happy mate. I'm really pleased for you, for both of you. LEWIS: Thanks, Gary. GARY: Now.. the big questions. Who's gonna be your best man, and when the fuck is the stag due? LEWIS: Fucking hell. Talk about subtle. Course I was going to ask you, you silly Bastard! Jesus, talk about spoil a moment. CARLA: This is the dress. SOPHIE: Oh, Carla it's beautiful. You're going to look stunning. Oh wow, love the price tag (!) CARLA: I know it's crazy. Try not to think about the cost. SOPHIE: It will be fine. I still can't believe he proposed to you, especially after all the big talk about him never getting hitched. CARLA: I know, me neither. He said he was walking past the jewelers, spotted the ring and knew. SOPHIE: So come on then. How did he propose? GARY: So come on. Give me the details. Come on! LEWIS: Alright. I took her to Bella's in the city. I made sure they had her faviourite wine chilled next to her. Made sure they had her faviourite dessert. I even made sure they had her faviourtie flowers put on the table. GARY: You old romantic, you. LEWIS: After dinner we walked around for a little bit. I took her for a lovely walk along the lake. CARLA: The moon light was shining in the water, it was so beautiful. He got down on one knee, kissed my hand and said, "There's been no one in my life that has made me feel the way you do. If I lost you I would be broken, I love you with everything I am. Will you marry me?" I said "Yes" without thinking twice. SOPHIE: I am so happy for you... and not at all jealous. LEWIS: I can't believe you! GARY: What!? LEWIS: What you boys use to get up to. GARY: You use to work there too remember? And what you use to get up to? Remember when you... LEWIS: Alright! I don't think we need to go there with innocent ears listening. SOPHIE: So what have you done now? GARY: Oh nothing honey. He's just trying to paint me in a bad light again. CARLA: Did you ask him babe? LEWIS: Yeah of course. Well, No, he kind of assumed and ruined a beautiful moment as always. GARY: I don't like to disappoint mate. CARLA: Well someone has to look after you when you are drunk. GARY: Come on, it's not his fault he's a lightweight. Still cheap night for me, hey? GARY: Catch you guys later, yeah! SOPHIE: See you later, and congratulations again. CARLA: Thank you. GARY: And your best man says, sleep tight and don't make too much noise doing it all night! SOPHIE: GARY! GARY: What? LEWIS: Get inside piss head! SOPHIE: Right come on you, lets get to bed. Congratulations again. Night. CARLA: Night. CARLA: I can't believe Gary, what's he like? LEWIS: Pissed! CARLA: It's good to see you smile. LEWIS: You say it like it's a rare occasion. CARLA: Well, just think it's all your training. Tyler keeps you busy. LEWIS: It's only because of the fight, he's just worried. I really needed this night out though. CARLA: Yeah, was fun. LEWIS: What's on your mind? CARLA: Do you really want to marry me? LEWIS: Hey, more than anything. Why wouldn't I want to wake up every day next to those beautiful blue eyes, lovely smile, your hair in my mouth. I love you. CARLA: I love you, too. Come on, get me to bed. CARLA: Can I ask you something? LEWIS: Anything. CARLA: We've never spoke about it, but, I guess I need to know. Do you want kids one day? Sorry you don't have to answer that, I just blurted that out. LEWIS: No it's fine, just a bit out of the blue. I've always wanted a family, me, you, few kids running around in the back. Taking walks in the park, playing fetch with the dog. Of course I want a family with you. CARLA: I want those things too. So, what kind of dog? LEWIS: Oh hey, that's a conversation for another night, now come here. [MUSIC] [{CROWD CHEERS] MARK: Don't be so nervous. TYLER: Take it easy, breathe. You've trained for this. You're ready. Okay.

See you at the gym on Monday. LEWIS: That you will. CARLA: So, has tonight's fight finally given you the confidence to make a career out of boxing? LEWIS: Yeah, it's definitely opened my eyes up to the possibility. CARLA: You should go for it babe, seriously if it's what you want to do you should just go for it. LEWIS: I was only doing it to keep fit. CARLA: Well it worked. LEWIS: What are we gonna do about money though? CARLA: It will be fine. LEWIS: You know I worry. We're just getting by as it is.

LEWIS: No. They all had plans. We haven't spent much time together lately, so I came straight home after the fight to be with you. CARLA: I'm glad. LEWIS: So. What have you been up to all day? CARLA: Well, I went to the doctors this morning. LEWIS: Is everything okay? CARLA: Yeah, I'm pregnant. LEWIS: Are you a hundred percent? CARLA: Yes. I'm four weeks along. LEWIS: Oh my God! GARY: Jesus, Lewis. Lewis! Lewis, wake up! LEWIS: GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME! GARY: It's me, Gary. LEWIS: FUCK OFF! GARY: Look at the state of yourself, ah. BLOODY HELL! Lewis, come on, get up son. GARY: There you go, get that down you. LEWIS: Ah, nice one. GARY: How you feeling? LEWIS: Better. Thanks for giving up your bed. Sure as shit beats a bench. GARY: Bloody hell. How long have you been like this? LEWIS: Too long. GARY: Why didn't you come back to me for help mate? LEWIS: Because I need to answer for the mistakes I made. Plus I don't think Sophie would appreciate me being here. GARY: No, she wouldn't. But I would have talked her round. LEWIS: I don't blame her for being upset with me. God, I've given her every possible reason to hate me. GARY: Look, that's all in the past mate. Look, get a shower. I'll give you some clothes and money. Just promise me you'll get some help. LEWIS: I will. GARY: Come on, lad. LEWIS: Hey Gary.. Thank you. GARY: Come on, mate. SOPHIE: Hi, babe. GARY: Hello, sweetheart. How was work? SOPHIE: Oh my God. I was so busy.

SOPHIE: I would love one. Thank you. Thank you. Babe. Who's in our shower? GARY: Okay, look. It's Lewis... SOPHIE: LEWIS! WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING HERE?! GARY: I found him laying on a bench on my way to work. I couldn't just leave him there, could I? SOPHIE: So let me get this straight, not only do you invite a thief into the house, but you also miss work as well. For fuck sake, Gary! When are you going to let him go? He's not our friend anymore. GARY: He is to me. You think it's easy to ignore him and forget about him don't you. Well, I can't ignore him. He needs our help, Sophie. SOPHIE: But we've tried it all before, Gary. Then what's he go and do, steals my jewelry, uses it to buy drugs! For fuck sake, Gary. That is not a friend in my eyes. GARY: Alright, Look. Let's just calm down. Yeah? I've already told him that he can't stay. SOPHIE: Oh, you are damn right he can't stay. Get him out of that shower or I WILL GO IN THERE AND I WILL DRAG HIM OUT MYSELF! GARY: Oh, for God's sake just leave him alone. At least let him have a shower. SOPHIE: Do you need your head tested? Leave him alone. YOU SHOULDN'T OF EVEN INVITED HIM IN THE FRONT DOOR!

Yeah? LEWIS: Look. What do you want? RAY: Well last time you looked in the need of some easy cash. Things ain't changed much. Have they? LEWIS: How much are we talking? RAY: Well I've got another event coming up haven't I. Tomorrow night in fact. Car park just down the road. ALways draws a crowd, guys with heavy wallets, but never enough guys with heavy fists. Chap like you could clear up. All you gotta do is be there. LEWIS: Alright, yeah. RAY: Good stuff. Eleven o clock. Don't be late. LEWIS: I won't. CARLA: What the hell are you doing here? LEWIS: Look I'm not here to cause trouble I just came to see my son. CARLA: NO! You lost that right two years ago when you decided to turn your back on your family and become a fucking junkie. LEWIS: I'm clean alright. Look I'm sorting out my life. Come on, Carla. I just want to talk to him, please. CARLA: I don't want you seeing him, Lewis. I'm sick of you coming into his life, making all these promises and then disappearing. You don't have to see his face when you break his heart. I shouldn't have to make excuses for you anymore, Lewis. LEWIS: No you shouldn't. Look, I won't make any promises. I just wanna see him. Come on, Carla please. I haven't seen him in three months. CARLA: And who's fault is that? I'm sorry, Lewis, you've had your chances, I won't let you mess us around anymore. LEWIS: Carla, don't stop me seeing him please. I'm just trying to do the right thing and be his father. CARLA: Yeah, because you did such a great job of that when we were together didn't you. LEWIS: Carla, please. Open the door carla. Come on. Please Carla! [BABY CRIES] CARLA: Thanks a lot. You could have gotten up for a change, you know I haven't slept properly! LEWIS: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I just can't deal with it right now. CARLA: He' s a baby, that's what they do. LEWIS: I know, Carla, and it's driving me up the fucking wall. CARLA: Well, it isn't doing me any favors either. Could you go and do him a bottle please. LEWIS: Gladly, anything to fucking shut him up. CARLA: You arsehole! LEWIS: What did you say? CARLA: He's six months old, he doesn't know any better. He probably has a tummy ache and all he wants is love from his parents. Why is that so hard to ask for? LEWIS: I'm sorry, okay? I'll go and do a bottle. CARLA: Thank you. [MICROWAVE] CARLA: Thanks. LEWIS: Fuck sake! LEWIS: FOR FUCK SAKE! WILL YOU SHUT HIM UP! I'VE GOT TO BE AT TRAINING AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT AT ALL! CARLA: I'm trying my best to get him to sleep. If you think you can do better be my guest. LEWIS: NO! I'M GOING BACK TO BED AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME FUCKING QUIET! IF THAT'S AT ALL FUCKING POSSIBLE?! LEWIS: Carla! Carla!? LEWIS: Hello? SUZANNE: I just wondered if you were free to come round this evening. LEWIS: Well, funnily enough I am. What you got in mind? SUZANNE: I just really need someone to talk to. LEWIS: Carla's got the car bit I could be round in about twenty minutes. SUZANNE: Okay. See you soon. LEWIS: See you in abit. MEGAN: This would look beautiful on you. CARLA: What with these baby hips? CHLOE: There's nothing wrong with a few curves, my dear. CARLA: I really hope Dad's Okay with Jacob. MEGAN: He'll be fine, you know he'll spoil him rotten. CHLOE: Sounds like a big kid himself, from what your Mum says. MEGAN: Are you okay, Hun? CARLA: Yeah, I'm okay. CHLOE: You don't sound okay. MEGAN: You can't lie to me, I've known you far too long. Seriously, are you okay? CHLOE: Come on. Let's go and get a coffee. [PEOPLE TALKING, CLATTER OF CUPS] MEGAN: So you know that vintage shop we went to last week what had the red dress? Well, I actually went back a couple of days later and brought that dress I thought it was cute. MEGAN: So, come on. What's going on? CARLA: It's Lewis... he... CHLOE: Don't tell me he's cheated on you! CARLA: No! Well not that I'm aware of... I trust him. CHLOE: What's wrong then? CARLA: We're just arguing a lot lately. I know boxing is his passion and if it wasn't for that we wouldn't have the life that we do. It's just... it rules our lives. He just never seems to have the time for me and jacob anymore. CHLOE: You hide it well hun, I had no idea things were bad. Don't you spend time with each other outside fights? CARLA: Not as much as I'd like. He's always training. He's been a bit sharp lately. Like the other day I was feeding Jacob and I jokingly put some food around his mouth and face, I thought it was really funny and so did he. MEGAN: But not Lewis? CARLA: No. He went crazy, moaning about the mess and that it was extra money he would have to fork out to buy more food. CHLOE: But it was only a spoonful. CARLA: I know. It's like he was just looking for an argument. CHLOE: How is he with Jacob? CARLA: I know he loves him, it's just, sometimes it seems like it's a chore for him. We can't seem to do anything right. He moans about every little thing. I just, think he's unhappy at home. Sorry guys. I didn't mean to bring down our day. CHLOE: Have you asked him to take some time out of boxing? Tell it to him straight; I need you here, family has to come first. CARLA: You must be joking. he would never do that. No even for me. Sometimes, it just feels like he would rather we weren't there. MEGAN: Don't say that. You know that's not true. CARLA: That's just how it feels. CHLOE: If it were me, I'd make him listen. Make him understand what it's really like for you to be shut up in that house all day with a screaming baby. MEGAN: Look, you can always try right? I mean it's better than sitting at home bottling up all your emotions and just being miserable. CARLA: okay, I'll try. Thank you. SUZANNE: Another? LEWIS: Nah! I'd love to but I'd really better be heading home. SUZANNE: Easy. You can't go home in this state. LEWIS: You know I feel a bit light headed. SUZANNE: Well, you're more than welcome to stay here if you want. LEWIS: Maybe it's a good idea. SUZANNE: Fuck me, Lewis! LEWIS: I'm sorry, I can't. SUZANNE: Drunk, and you still can't do it? What the fuck have I got to do? LEWIS: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lead you on. SUZANNE: No, you shouldn't of. If you chose to stay here, do not be here when I wake up! LEWIS: Fuck! [PHONE RINGS] [RINGS STOP] LEWIS: Hi babe, you okay? I'm on my way home now. How was your night? Yeah, I love you too. CARLA: Morning. LEWIS: Morning, babe. I'm just gonna grab a shower. CARLA: Where did you go last night? I tried calling you but there was no answer. LEWIS: I went round Suzanne's. Is that a problem? CARLA: I knew it, I fucking knew it! Yes, Lewis, it's a problem! LEWIS: Why? What do you have against her? CARLA: Everything, the fact that you've been intimate with her, The fact you tell her stuff about us. You know I'm not happy with that. LEWIS: For God sakes, she's one of my best friends, Carla. I've known her since I was four years old! CARLA: I just don't trust her, Lewis. LEWIS: Look, it's you I'm with, not her, okay? CARLA: No. It's not okay. You've been in a relationship with this woman and now you've spent the night at her house. LEWIS: So, nothing happened. CARLA: How would you feel if I'd got drunk and spent the night round an ex-boyfriends house? LEWIS: I trust you, Carla. [MUSIC] LEWIS: I've got to go train. CARLA: Fine. LEWIS: Look, I wanna stay but I've got to pay the bills. CARLA: You just signed a deal worth fifty thousand pounds. What bills? LEWIS: This is who I am, you know I've gotta do this. CARLA: What about me? I've now got to sit here on my own. No doubt Jacob will cry all day. LEWIS: What do you want me to do? This is my job. That deal means I have to fight another three times. CARLA: I don't want you to box anymore. I don't care about the money. LEWIS: Look, you know I have to go. Come on, I'll miss you. CARLA: No, you won't. TYLER: Box. Come on, one, two, one, two. Jab. Hook. Upper cut, upper cut. Remember your feet, come on, breathe, breathe! Faster. faster. A hook! A hook! Alright, alright! Time, time, time! Lets get some sparring in. Joe, get your head gear on. In that ring. In the ring! TYLER: Come together, touch gloves. You know the shots, eighty percent power. Step back. BOX! Come on Lewis. Throw some punches. Get some jabs in. Come on! Come on, Lewis, defense! Come on hit him! Come on! Come on, work! Come on! Time, time, time! Jesus, Lewis! What's going on? Is everything okay? LEWIS: I'm fine, Tyler. Come on. TYLER: Come on lad, You can't lie to me. What's going on? LEWIS: NOTHING! TYLER: Let's take this to the office, come on. Time, Joe. TYLER: Okay, Lewis. What's going on? LEWIS: Just me and Carla are going through a really rough patch. I just think with all my training, she's feeling a bit lonely. TYLER: I've always admired your dedication and your heart. So I'm not going to bollock you for wanting to spend time with your wife. LEWIS: I just think I need to spend some more time with my family. When is my next fight? TYLER: To be honest kid, we're still in negotiations. Now's probably a good time to take a break. Go, spend some time with your family. Take as long as you need. Come back to us when you're ready. Seriously, take your time. LEWIS: Okay. Thanks, Tyler. TYLER: Good lad. CARLA: What are you doing home? Thought you'd be out all day. LEWIS: I came home to be with you. CARLA: What about training? LEWIS: I'm stopping for the next month. You were right, I need to be here with my family, you two are the most important things in my life, and I don't want to push you away. [MUSIC] [MUSIC FADES] LEWIS: No, that's great, yeah, yeah. Speak about it later, yeah. No, I'm happy, of course. Yeah, it's good news, course it's good news. Look, Carla's cooking dinner. Great, speak to you then. Bye. So, Jacob at your mum's and we have the whole evening to ourselves. CARLA: What was that about? LEWIS: Oh, nothing. Just Tyler talking about the next fight. CARLA: Oh, okay. LEWIS: Something smells good. CARLA: That would be dinner. LEWIS: No, I think it's you that smells good. CARLA: Lewis, come on, I'm cooking. Lewis! LEWIS: What? CARLA: Stop it! LEWIS: No. CARLA: LEWIS, STOP IT! LEWIS: What's wrong? CARLA: Nothing, I'm just not in the mood. LEWIS: I come near you and it's like you can't bare me to touch you. What have I done? What, carla? CARLA: It's the boxing, can't you see that? You were suppose to give this family a month and after only four days your back on the phone organising your next fight. I want a proper family, Lewis. Can't you see all the things you're missing at home? LEWIS: I know what I have at home, Carla, and we have been a family. But it's boxing that gives us this life style. I've signed a contract i can't get out of, what do you want me to do? What, Carla? What's going on? CARLA: I don't like how close you are to Suzanne. LEWIS: Ah, for fuck sake. We're just friends. CARLA: I'm sorry, I really tried to overlook the fact you got drunk and slept round her house. LEWIS: So what? Nothing happened! I had a few beers and crashed out on her sofa. CARLA: I still don't believe you. LEWIS: It's nice to know you trust me. CARLA: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO THINK!? LEWIS: Ah, For God sake, are you for real? We have a beautiful son, a nice home, everything we ever wanted. Do you really think I'd throw it away for a quick fuck? CARLA: I can't do this. LEWIS: Carla, what are you doing? Carla, where are you going? Carla, will you talk to me? Oh, Carla, don't do this. What are you doing? I said I can change. CARLA! LEWIS: Carla, where are you going? Carla, come back! For fuck sake, Carla! Carla, what are you doing? Come back in. CARLA! CARLA: DON'T! You don't know what it's like here for me on my own. Jacob cries all day. You don't support me. I really thought this last month would change things. But you can't change, not even for your family. This isn't a marriage. There's no love here anymore. LEWIS: I still love you. CARLA: See? I can't! [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] RAY: Right, as always no one starts fighting until we have the rules. They're nice and simple, you shouldn't forget them. I want a good, clean fight and that means none of that shit like last time, otherwise you're out for good. No low blows, if one guy taps be a gentleman take a step back give him some room and we'll take it from there. Right boys, let's have a shake. Well, half a shakes good enough, I suppose. If you're ready gentleman? FIGHT! [HEAVY MUSIC] [SOFT MUSIC] [HEAVY MUSIC] [SOFT MUSIC] [HEAVY MUSIC] [SOFT MUSIC] LEWIS: After that fight I spent two months in recovery. I took the money, grabbed my gear and walked off. I just remember waking up with a nurse standing over me with a banging headache. I suffered a fractured cheek bone, severe cuts to the face and two broken ribs. I remember looking in the mirror that morning and thinking, was it all worth it? Why had I let my life become this bad? I had fame, money, family and I threw it all away. When I left the hospital, I knew I had to change my life. My coach, Tyler, stood by me. He helped me get a job teaching boxing to kids, which is incredible. It's great to know that you can make a difference in someone else's life. My best friend, Gary was kind enough to help me get my own place, it's not big, but it's warm with a bed. Me and Carla are finally civil and I get to see my little boy, Jacob now once a week. It's just wonderful watching him grow. LEWIS: So, with this being my two year anniversary clean and sober, I'd just like to thank everyone who stood by me, Never gave up on me and loved me through thick and thin. Here's to more clean and sober years. [MUSIC] SUZANNE: Lewis? LEWIS: Suzanne? Oh, My God! Hey, you. How you doing? SUZANNE: I'm good, thanks. Wow, you're looking really well. LEWIS: I feel it. You're looking good yourself. SUZANNE: Always the charmer I see. LEWIS: Some things don't change. SUZANNE: I heard about you and Carla. Sorry about that. LEWIS: Ah, these things happen, that's life. I get to see Jacob every weekend and you know what, that's all that matters. SUZANNE: I'm happy you get to see him. LEWIS: Me too. You know it's weird that I bump in to you, I was literally thinking about you the other day. You know the way we left things... I wanted to clear the air, maybe apologise for what happened. SUZANNE: It's okay, Lewis. Should me who' s apologising. I knew you were married and I shouldn't of tried it on. LEWIS: No one's perfect. What are you doing now? SUZANNE: Nothing. LEWIS: Do you wanna get a drink? SUZANNE: Yeah... yeah, I'd love to. LEWIS: Great. SUZANNE: So, what have you been up to? LEWIS: I've been teaching boxing...
