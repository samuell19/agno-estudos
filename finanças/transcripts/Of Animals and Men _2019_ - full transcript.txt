a Polish Film Institute Co-financed Production directed by As I look back at those events after so many years, I'm astonished they are filled with so many animals. Obviously, no one is surprised by people appearing in a war story, but the presence of creatures with fur or wings is rather startling. Our house was situated in the heart of the Warsaw ZOO. Jan and I moved into this house in 1931. We'd met at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. I was an archives employee, Jan was a lecturer. A handsome man with steel eyes and a brilliant intellect. I was captivated by him from the start. He fulfilled the prediction I'd heard from a palm reader in the past. She said that after our wedding, my husband and I would move into a place filled with flowers and animals. She never mentioned though that my husband would be a ZOO director. This is my dad with a cigarette. I've never seen it before. Is this Ottie with me? It feels incredible to watch yourself as a toddler. I was born in the Warsaw ZOO. I distinctly remember the room in which we slept in the company of animals. Dad's sleeping by the window. Here's Mum on the sofa by the wall, guarded by a winged creature. This is my brother Ryś. I'm right there behind him. So my first memory was of many beds and sofas, with a hedgehog and a turtle roaming around. And "Ottie" the otter. Ottie was more or less of my age. We spent a lot of time together. My elder brother Ryś preferred to play with his friends or animals. In our house, there was a mix of people and animals. Four-legged friends were always hanging around people. The Warsaw ZOO welcomes new inhabitants. Ms. Giraffe, you can relax now after your exhausting journey. Other honoured guests clearly suffer from stage fright as they take their first careful steps in Poland. But there are exceptions. The camels seem to greatly enjoy walking on the cobbled streets of Warsaw. In a moment, they will arrive at the ZOO, where spacious and comfortable pens are already prepared for them. The new tenants should feel right at home! Only after I moved into the ZOO, I could see how hard it was to start from scratch. The ZOO was barely two years old. It lacked equipment and rooms. Newborn, weak or sick animals often stayed in our house. Jan enjoyed himself immensely. After all, he was a professional. But to me, everything was a novelty. I had to learn the basics. Our house had always been a refuge for the weak, for those in need. The person responsible for helping and saving them was my Mum. She was the one who looked after them as a non-professional breeder. Dad trusted her completely. I managed to raise two female lynxes. They were the ones that sealed my bond with the ZOO. In their honour, I named my son Ryś, which stands for "lynx" in Polish. Stay tuned for the nature show "Dr. Żabiński behind the Mic". Here comes a fairy tale. Once upon a time, there was a little white goat. People took the little white goat to a white building with... Roar! I shudder to think! Huge, angry, roaring tigers. And dangerous lions. So many fangs, claws, and terrifying looks directed at one little white goat. Why is the goat here? Don't worry. It won't be eaten. First, small gloves will be pulled on to cover the lion cubs' claws. Then, everything will be clear. The little white goat is a wet nurse for the lion cubs rejected by their mother. Our ZOO quickly built up an international reputation. The twelfth elephant born in captivity was delivered in Warsaw. African wild dogs were bred in captivity for the first time in our ZOO. Later, a female Przewalski's horse had a foal. Our ZOO was teeming with life. There was something special about our ZOO that made several sensitive people stay here. For example, Magdalena Gross, an outstanding sculptor. She came here when she was going through a crisis. She believed she was finished as an artist. The ZOO changed her life. Here, she realized she was a bird: a starling. She even learnt to whistle like a starling. In the summer of 1939, the ZOO looked impressive. Soon, the International Association of ZOO Directors would hold a conference in Warsaw. It was a great honour and joy. We looked forward to that event. When our will is strong enough that no hardship or suffering can subdue it, then our will and German steel shall prevail. Germany, Hail Victory! The rumours about the war were getting stronger. They worried even the greatest optimists. Many Warsaw inhabitants decided to go away to safer places. But for the ZOO employees, this wasn't an easy decision. Apart from our families, we also looked after those dependent on us: our animals. On the morning of 1 September 1939, Jan and I went to Zalesie, but got stuck in Saviour Square. We were caught in the first air raid. Only then did the loudspeakers announce that it had begun. As we were going back home, I was forced to understand and digest the new reality. So this is war. From now on, anything is less important than this. Our lives have been steered in a different direction. The ZOO was a strategic point located between two Warsaw bridges. One of the first bombs blew the polar bear pen to pieces. Terrified, they left the ZOO premises. Kasia the elephant was killed by shrapnel. A giraffe, several monkeys, and antelopes died as well. Chimpanzees and exotic birds were burnt alive. Seals, foxes, and badgers disappeared into thin air. Smaller animals scurried away in terror. Our lost friends wandered by the river for weeks. Hello! Can you hear us? This is our last announcement. Today, the German troops have entered Warsaw. We salute the Polish soldiers fighting on the Hel Peninsula and those fighting wherever they can. "Poland has not yet perished!" Long live Poland! The most dangerous predator went on a killing spree in the streets of Warsaw. Once, I saw our lioness tormented by inexplicable anxiety. She took her cubs one by one and moved them here and there, running around her cage in panic. Now, we felt the same. We wanted to save our friends. The city's administration was gradually taken over by the Germans. The Polish institutions had the financial support cut off. The ZOO was deprived of means to survive. For now, we used the resources left by the army and relied on the help from the Warsaw inhabitants. Every day, they brought baskets of leftovers and vegetable peelings. The ruined city offered all kinds of help to its ZOO to feed the animals that survived. Soon, Lutz Heck paid us a visit. Professor Heck was a high-ranking Nazi official. He was in charge of all the issues related to nature, hunting, and zoology of the Third Reich. In his free time, he used to collect live specimens. He loved hunting and stuffing animals. Before the war, Lutz Heck had been the director of the Berlin ZOO. He'd met my parents at International Conferences of ZOO Directors. So they'd known each other much earlier. Dad used to make jokes about Heck having a crush on Mum. Heck himself said she resembled his fiancée. We knew Heck had an idea to bring back extinct animals, such as the aurochs or the tarpan. To make it happen, he needed our bison and Przewalski's horses. Heck claimed he had no influence over decisions taken by his superiors. He said: "The animals that the Germans find uninteresting will be killed." "Those valuable to them will be sent to the Berlin ZOO." "Please treat it as a loan," said Heck. "If the animals survive the war, you'll get them back." "And I'll take personal care of your favourite lynx, Ms. Antonina," he told me. Until dusk, we heard vehicles coming into and leaving our ZOO. Tuzinka the elephant was going to Königsberg, camels and llamas to Hanover, Przewalski's horses to Vienna, lynxes and bison to Schorfheide, hippopotamuses to Nuremberg. On New Year's Eve, some Gestapo officers held a ZOO hunting event. To distract my son, I was reading to him about Robinson Crusoe freeing Friday. But he couldn't focus, as if sensing something was wrong. "What was that?" asked Ryś. I stared bluntly at the open book, letters dancing on the page. My son pulled my arm, but I couldn't utter a word. Back then, I didn't realize how many people would share the fate of our animals. It suddenly got so quiet. Every now and then, I expected to see one of our friends leaping out from behind bushes. But none of them ever did. We had to focus on everyday issues. The house seemed the same. Yet, our life was completely different. How were we supposed to survive? You can pretend there's no war. Or you can think about it all the time. My idea was different. I kept telling myself: "Let's hang on today or until tomorrow." I focused on the order of duties. Close the door, turn the lights off, draw the curtains, feed Ryś, fall asleep, hang on until tomorrow. Once it was known the ZOO had to close down, there was a new idea to use the available facilities. A pig farm was set up in the ZOO. Most of all, Dad tried to help his former employees to keep their jobs. One spring day, a little runaway from the pig farm came to our house. I called it Moryś. In the morning, the new friend got into Ryś's room and nudged his leg with its snout, demanding to be patted. The piglet followed Ryś everywhere, like a dog. That image - the tiny silhouettes of the boy and the piglet on a path - helped me forget about the reality for a moment. After Ryś lost his beloved animals, I was happy to see him cheerful again. Not for long though. The Germans took the piglet to the slaughterhouse. In the autumn, ZOO buildings with central heating were no longer heated. The slaughterhouse director refused to buy straw for the farm. We thought the decision was absurd. Jan failed to convince the director to restore the supplies. The cold became intense, every day more pigs died. Then, an epidemic of swine dysentery broke out. The pig farm was closed down. In 1942, my parents were made an offer to reopen the ZOO. "What a happy day," I thought. "Isn't it what we wanted?" We might go back to work. We no longer had to watch the empty pens and ZOO equipment going to waste month by month. We'd hear visitors laugh and talk again. And our four-legged wild friends would have a big audience. On the one hand, it was a tempting offer for Dad. Once again, he might be doing what he wanted. But on the other, if he'd agreed, it would have been morally doubtful. The Poles used to boycott entertainment organized by the Germans. We realized our humanistic and educational assumptions differed from the Germans' intentions. They would turn the ZOO into cheap entertainment. There was also the food issue. Though still tolerable, it could get worse any day. How to fight for food rations for animals when people were starving to death? It was hard to simply say "no". So Dad came up with complex problems and enormous obstacles. He mentioned current and future issues that the ZOO might face. As a result, fortunately, the Germans gave up the idea. I was busy with household duties when the phone rang. Julian Kulski, the President of Warsaw, wanted to talk to Jan about setting up allotments in the ZOO's lawns, an idea proposed to him by Jan a few weeks earlier. Dividing the ZOO into allotments wouldn't destroy the park. The decision to adapt the ZOO grounds for the needs of the Warsaw inhabitants could be used by the Germans to brag about their kindness to the city dwellers. This convincing prospect of German charity was offered by President Kulski to the Nazi administrator of Warsaw, Oberführer Ludwig Leist. Jan had to change his job again. Stay tuned for the nature show "Dr. Żabiński behind the Mic". Apart from talking about animals, my task is to acquaint the listeners with the nature and processes of biological research. With this idea in mind, I'd like to present to you Dr. Szymon Tenenbaum, five years my senior. I had met him in secondary school. Since we were children, we'd been interested in animals. After graduation, we devoted ourselves to zoology. Tenenbaum never took the easy way out. Evidence of this was his primary field of study: the largest, thus extremely difficult, group of animals, namely beetles. In 1940, on the invader's orders, the Tenenbaums were sent to the ghetto. Our dear scientist had 500 huge boxes of beetles he'd collected. Tenenbaum took his collection to my place, the ZOO. Even in the ghetto, that mad enthusiast could find a patch of greenery that he used as a research ground. One day, a German limousine pulled up in front of my house in the ZOO. A stocky forty-year-old man in a black uniform got out of the car. "I'm the head of the Warsaw Ghetto Labour Office" "and my hobby is entomology." "I've heard you have Dr. Tenenbaum's beetle collection." "Where did you hear that?" "From Dr. Tenenbaum. He also mentioned your name." I showed him everything. "What a man!" murmured the German. He called the collection "enorm" and "kolossal". Suddenly, he came up with a suggestion. "Dr. Tenenbaum asks you for a visit and I can make it happen." Jan quickly reacted to Ziegler's offer. He mentioned a box of insects that was going mouldy. He said he needed to consult the entomologist. The building of the Labour Office, located by the ghetto gate, had a direct pass to the ghetto. Ziegler gave Jan permission to consult Professor Tenenbaum whenever he needed. Owing to that, Jan had free access to the ghetto. When Kazimierz and Ludwika Kramsztyk were sent to the ghetto, Jan Żabiński used to visit them from the beginning. I have a postcard from Ludwika. One of the things she writes is really important. "Kazimierz's friend, Mr. Jan from the ZOO pays us a visit every few days." "We are always very happy to see him." This is the postcard. It was written in December 1940. Which means it was the ghetto's beginning. The mass deportations of ghetto inhabitants began in July 1942. Not everyone realized where they were going. First news about mass extermination at camps looked like sick fantasies. Deporting people for forced labour and a reign of terror in the ghetto forced us to wonder desperately what we could do. Jan believed in well-developed strategies. The chances of success depended on the amount of common sense we were able to retain in that madness. Still, we decided we'd be doing that. My childhood? I had no childhood. We lived in the ghetto. I was hungry all the time. Skeletons were lying in the streets. It was a terrible sight. There came a huge horse-drawn wagon. Jewish policemen crammed people into the wagon. The wagon went to the Umschlagplatz. Then, those people got on a train going to Treblinka. Those policemen steered clear of our flat. They were scared of my father. He was a famous boxer who could hit hard. But once, there was this incident I remember... A short Jewish policeman came to our place. He told Mum: "Onto the wagon. Now!" Mum picked Stefcia up and I held her by the dress. And we went onto the wagon. Three or four minutes longer and we'd have gone to the Umschlagplatz. But Mum noticed Dad's hat in the distance. And she shouted to him in Yiddish. He heard it and started to run. He whistled. Young men appeared out of different nooks and crannies. They beat up the policemen, scattered, and hid. If Dad hadn't heard her or Mum hadn't seen him, we would be ash now. We were lucky. After this incident, the Germans were looking for Dad. Dad thought: "They might catch me any day." "We'd better escape from the ghetto." And I... I was a sensitive child. When we arrived, I got scared. "Will the ZOO people let us stay?" I remember how frightened we were when we got to the ZOO... Not everyone was willing to put their families in danger to save Jews. One day, Regina Kenigswein appeared on our doorstep. A beautiful sister of a friend of ours, she had changed beyond recognition. I was shocked by what her eyes expressed. Literature often describes the expression in people's eyes. Angry, kind, pretty, ugly, happy, devastated. But if you've looked into the eyes of a mother facing death, you know you won't describe or ever forget such eyes. She arrived with her husband and two little kids. She'd left the third one in a convent and had the fourth in her belly. "I'm so young, I want to live," she told me. The moment I saw her... I calmed down. I even told my mother: "Mum, this is where we'll live." The older boy looked at me with complete trust. I felt deep shame at being helpless and terrified. We made a bed for them in an underground corridor of the old lion enclosure. We used to receive a discreet message about the arrival of new guests. They posed as allotment workers to stay in the ZOO for a few days, weeks or even months. Some took shelter in sheds and stables, well hidden in the thickets. Others stayed in our house. My grandfather Andrzej Kramsztyk didn't follow the order issued by the Germans. He refused to move to the ghetto. He said he wouldn't let them lock him up there. They left Warsaw, roaming from village to village. They were mobbed, blackmailed, and robbed. In May or June 1942, they were violently evicted from a flat in Kobyłka. The family had to split up. My mother, a minor back then, went to Warsaw. She tried to hide in various places. But at the critical point, when she was homeless, my grandfather advised her as her last resort to go to Jan Żabiński's place. She stayed in his villa for about one month. She arrived at night when the housekeeper had left the house. She walked out before the housekeeper returned. My husband was an organised man. A Home Army soldier, he kept in touch with underground cells. He saw his friends at the ghetto and brought them food. He took them out of the ghetto and into the ZOO. He fixed documents necessary for their escape. He was a soldier even at home. He produced explosives, the ingredients of which he stored in cans in our kitchen. Dad had a ghetto pass. Later on, he started to use it for other people. He could easily enter the ghetto. When he wanted to get someone out, he used his pass for this person. We found out that Tenenbaum was dead. Our house became even sadder. Most of all, we worried about Lonia, the Professor's widow. Finally, we decided Jan would go to the ghetto to get her out. Together, they approached the exit gate, which Jan often used. Instead of the watchman Jan knew, there was his wife. The woman refused to open the gate. "You're forcing me to bother Mr. Ziegler!" shouted Jan. This argument convinced her. Jan and Lonia went out of the ghetto and saw two German policemen. Lonia was ready to run, but Jan ignored her. He stopped to pick up a cigarette butt. Then, he calmly took her arm and slowly walked away to the ZOO. The first Jews saved by my parents, who were hiding in the ZOO, were obviously their friends. Later on, strangers were saved as well. For instance, people with mental issues. Those people might also get killed if they walked down the street. There were two Grey Ranks boys. They were brought to the ZOO after one of their military actions and had to stay in hiding. They were taken to an empty pheasant coop. In the coop, there's always a hut where birds can sleep. The boys were locked in the coop. There was a padlock on the door. Of course, they were fed the next day. My brother Ryś used to visit them. Afterwards, we always called those boys "Pheasants". Later on, there were "Squirrels", that is the Kenigsweins. There was also "Hamster", that is Maurycy Fraenkel. Our house was called Noah's Ark. The name was coined by Magdalena Gross. I was worried about Magdalena Gross, who stayed in the "Aryan" part of the city. With her non-Aryan looks, it was a risky thing to do. Finally, our dear Starling flew to the ZOO to hide. But even this place wasn't completely safe. Being famous before the war had its drawbacks. Someone might have recognized Magdalena and let it slip she was staying in the ZOO. Despite the depressing situation, Starling stayed cheerful, as usual spreading her wings in the face of any obstacle. Perhaps her surprising optimism was her way to handle the atrocities. Anyway, her cheerfulness was uplifting for us all. Ryś was familiar with resistance rules since his early years. He was responsible for feeding the people in hiding, people from the ghetto and Polish soldiers. He paid visits to our guests, made sure they didn't need anything. He talked to them and cheered them up. Ryś also cleared their chamber pots and was on the lookout. He spent half of his childhood being a soldier. Those who took shelter in animals' enclosures didn't use to stay for long. The conditions were severe: it was too cold. Those who took shelter in the house were better-off. They stayed for a specific period, not the entire occupation. They left once Dad fixed proper documents for them. Or he found a different place where they could stay in hiding. I was responsible for provisions. My job was to find food and prepare meals for everyone. I took care of the appearance of the people in hiding. The right looks, namely "Aryan", could save a person's life. I also had to play the grand piano. My repertoire? Mainly Offenbach and Chopin. Such an elegant wartime life, the inherent element of which was cyanide. Jan and I always had it on us. A lethal rescue if we were caught. Were my parents scared? Did they know the risk? Yes, they were scared. They knew the risk. During the occupation, during the war, anyone who helped the Jews was punished with death. Not only the person who actually helped them, but also his or her entire family. Yet, the goal was too important. Our job was to be scared. Day and night, day and night. We were quiet as a mouse. Even though we were kids, we knew the meaning of evil. We knew everyone wanted to kill us. We knew it perfectly well. In order to survive, we had to be quiet. Back in the ghetto, Dad had taught me how to act. I couldn't cry. There was no point in crying. I should hide or play so that no one could see me. I knew how to act. But my sister was too little to learn such things. She's two years younger than me. After the capitulation of Warsaw, the German weapons depot in the lion enclosure was constantly guarded. Every day, German soldiers came to the ZOO for a walk. They could easily see our house. It had huge Venetian windows without net curtains. In fact, any pedestrian could see what was going on inside. And that was exactly our goal. Could any conspiracy be going on here? Ms. Antonina taught us that in case of danger... There were a lot of Germans around the place... She said she'd play a particular tune on the piano. And once all danger passed, she'd play a different tune. So, when she started playing Offenbach's "The Beautiful Helen", we would hide in a dark corner, keeping quiet. And later, when she played a piece by Chopin, I think, we knew the danger was over and we could walk around the basement. Ms. Antonina took us down to a shelter in the basement of the villa. My sister and I were in one of the rooms. There, under a concrete shelf, we were squatting in a corner. She explained to us we couldn't stay with our parents. "Mum and Dad will be safe in animals' cages." But when we couldn't see our parents, we kept worrying what would happen to them. I held my hand on my sister's mouth. I tried to calm her down. "Everything's gonna be fine." "Mum and Dad are in hiding, they will be fine." But she cried for Mum. So I said: "Mum will come and see us, don't cry." We met nobody. We didn't even know other people were hiding there. And that's good. If someone gets caught, they might turn others in. At first, when we heard footsteps down the stairs, we were terrified. But when I saw Ryś's legs, I calmed down. Extreme emotions. I was very happy to see Ryś. He brought some life into the basement. Otherwise, we were completely cut off from the world. Four weeks later, Ms. Antonina gathered us upstairs. She wanted to make us look less Jewish. So she tried to bleach our hair blond. The Jews have either black or red hair. In the bathroom, she rubbed our heads. We got blisters on our heads but saw no blond colour. Although she tried really hard, we ended up with red hair. When we got out, Ryś shouted: "Mum! You turned them into squirrels!" When I sometimes think about it, I see the Żabińskis among the people owing to whom I am alive. Those who helped my mother survive allowed me to be born. It is beyond doubt. With the winter nearly over, the situation in Warsaw became exceedingly dangerous. More and more guests came to our house looking for shelter. Fugitives who barely escaped death wanted to fool themselves into thinking that they would be safe in the house separated from the war by the river. They had to believe it to avoid getting mad. On the night of 18 and 19 April 1943, a glow of fire lit up the sky over the ghetto. The shots rang out. A message was whispered from mouth to mouth: the Germans began the liquidation of the ghetto to celebrate Hitler's birthday. The fact that tens of thousands of innocent people were being killed terrified the entire city. Grey clouds of smoke crossed the river and reached our ZOO, together with the choking smell. That smell was our only link with the people stuck out there. The liquidation of the ghetto curbed our activity. The number of those who needed a place to hide was cruelly reduced. During the war, I told myself it was not a nightmare of death and extermination, but hibernation. It can't be a period of inactivity if a new energy is born. For example, bears have their cubs during hibernation. At the end of June, our daughter Teresa was born. The new life raised new hopes. On 1 August, at 7.00 a.m., a liaison officer came with an order. Jan was to immediately report at the assembly point. My husband came to a room where I was sleeping with little Teresa. He held a mess tin with a gun inside. "Just in case," he said. "You don't believe in the Uprising, do you?" I asked. "We were too late," he replied. This is the "Lightning", a Warsaw-based radio station of the Home Army on 32.8- and 52.2-meter bands. The Germans keep burning our city. As soon as the Uprising began, a car filled with Gestapo agents pulled up outside our house. They claimed it was a hiding place of Uprising soldiers. They told everyone to get out of the house because they wanted to search it for weapons. I was already born back then. Everybody had to leave the house and stand against the wall. One of the Gestapo agents pointed at my brother and told him: "Go over there!" He showed a thicket behind the corner of the house. Numb, I watched him leave and disappear in the thicket. I guessed he must have got to hollyhocks by the study windows. A gunshot paralysed me. I went blind. In the dark, I heard a shout: "Give me that chicken!" Ryś walked out of the thicket, staggering. He carried a dead chicken. He stood by my side, his head lowered. I whispered: "You're very brave, son." That cruel joke satisfied the Germans. They left without finishing the search. Soon afterwards, they set up heavy artillery in the ZOO. It was no longer the right place for a woman with two little kids. The secret guests of the ZOO had to find different hiding places. We found shelter in a countryside school. For months, we anxiously waited for Jan or a message from him. Finally, we got a letter. Jan was seriously injured on the eighth day of the Uprising. He was transferred to an Oflag. He was alive... In January, we received the news about the German troops leaving Poland. We set off at once, ignoring the freezing cold, bravely faced only by Teresa wrapped in a duvet. We drove into the Wola district. Many people had told me about the current state of Warsaw. Still, I was genuinely shocked. It's impossible to describe the war landscape. I slowly went through the ZOO gate. The snow-covered ground, the treetops smashed by the bombs... In the distance, I saw the shape of our house. One room on the first floor was destroyed. Some wooden walls were missing. We checked the garden and noticed new bomb craters. Chips, shells, and pieces of barbed wire were scattered everywhere. The pens had no fences. The war had left only recently. But we desperately wanted to forget it. Mum knew Dad was alive. So what mattered to her the most was to obtain a quick decision from the authorities to reconstruct the ZOO and continue its work. I was appointed by the new Warsaw authorities to secure the ZOO grounds. I kept crossing the river to convince many decision-makers to support our ZOO. The Warsaw Reconstruction Office finally stated that the existing ZOO facilities and buildings should stay where they were and be restored to function with only modest financial support. One day, as I was coming home, I met our housekeeper. "Go home, quickly!" she shouted from a distance. "Your husband's here!" I don't remember how I got to the villa. Jan looked as if he had left only that morning. Our children were sitting on his lap. Only his flushed cheeks showed how moved he was. After reporting to the city authorities, he immediately got a job at the radio station. I remained on guard at the ZOO. Stay tuned for the nature show "Dr. Żabiński behind the Mic". Back in 1929, when I decided to become the director of the fledgling Warsaw ZOO, I remembered the words of a distinguished professor of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, where I'd been working as a lecturer at the Institute of Physiology and Zoology. Let me quote: "Look at Żabiński, what a waste of talent!" "He could have easily become a professor," "but was tempted by this funfair." However, I was not tempted by the funfair. The ZOO I imagined was meant to be completely different. Most of all, it was going to be the centre of nature conservation, in the face of the terrifyingly fast extinction of large mammals. Also, it was going to be an educational institution. The ZOO should not only show the looks of animals, but also their biology and lifestyle. The decision to rebuild the ZOO was only the first step. Where to find the money to do it? With its unique energy, the ZOO had always attracted people, turning them into loyal, interested friends. Owing to such people and our persistence, we received the long-awaited decision from the National Council. They allocated four million złotys for the ZOO reconstruction. So this was a victory! Though it's hard to say so if you start from scratch. The work in the ZOO is in full swing to reopen the favourite place of the Warsaw inhabitants. There's still a lot to do so even Antonina Żabińska and her husband Director Jan Żabiński are helping out. The final measurements are taken to create comfortable homes for new inhabitants, which are on their way to the ZOO. The exotic caravan caused a sensation in Warsaw. The new tenants are waving their legs and trunks as they look forward to seeing their new homes. All animals are expected by caring keepers, but most of all, by the Warsaw inhabitants. Even today, when I close my eyes, the memories of those days are still vivid in my mind. During the war, we didn't think our kingdom of wild animals would ever be teeming with life again. And yet it was. I wished Starling had been there with us. The war took her health away. One year before, she'd flown away for good. All we had was her sculptures. And memories of the wartime inhabitants of our ZOO. The following years saw new problems. Jan still worked for the ZOO. Yet, his visions differed from the ones of the communist authorities. Surveillance and persecution were growing worse. In 1953, Jan filed a resignation. We had to move out of our villa. Jan said we mustn't visit the ZOO. He kept his word. But our children and I kept our secret. Because it's not easy to abandon old friends. It is estimated that the Żabiński family saved as many as 300 people in wartime. Some took shelter for one day, others stayed in the ZOO for months. On 21 September 1965, Jan and Antonina were honoured as the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Having left the ZOO, Jan became a promoter of science. He did hundreds of radio shows and wrote several books about animals. Antonina wrote books as well. Antonia Żabińska died in Warsaw in 1971. Jan passed away three years later. Their son Ryszard died on 9th April 2019. featuring written and directed by director of photography editor music by produced by Subtitle translation by Magdalena Cedro
