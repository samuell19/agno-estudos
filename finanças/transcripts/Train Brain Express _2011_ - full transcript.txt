Hydrangeas. What? Yamato pork! "Watarase". It's on time. ﻿Over there! There! ﻿This seat is hard. ﻿But the breeze feels so good. ﻿This seat is hard! What? ﻿You're enjoying in your own world? ﻿I thought we're enjoying ﻿the ride in our own way. ﻿Having fun? ﻿Does this give you a reggae vibe too? ﻿Get out of here, man! ﻿You're using that term wrong! -Mr Kodama, you're amazing. -﻿Your mind's always on your work. ﻿That's right. ﻿This train car is also built ﻿from the things we make. All right. ﻿Let's enjoy the ride together. Look, there's the ravine. Ravine? ﻿Back off! —It's lovely! ﻿—What a view! ﻿Get out of my way! I'm getting off. ﻿But there won't be another train in an hour. ﻿"Train Brain Express" All trains are currently suspended. ﻿This is bad. ﻿But it'll be all right. ﻿It'll be all right. ﻿You're not worried? Why? ﻿Come with me. I'll help you out. ﻿We're near Kitasenju. ﻿What pretty flowers! They're gerberas. ﻿But it's so early... ﻿They come on the first train from Chiba. ﻿Maybe I'll buy some. ﻿Please do. ﻿The station's straight ahead. ﻿Don't be so standoffish. ﻿You picked me out from the crowd. Cross here for Kitasenju Station. ﻿Make it this far, ﻿and you can go anywhere. ﻿"Kodama Iron Works Factory" Here you go. ﻿Make sure you chew properly. Mr Kodama, I enjoyed the train ride. ﻿﻿Thank you. ﻿Next time. I want to head for Hanshin. ﻿I love Kansai! ﻿You can't make the trip in a day. Maybe you'd rather work there? ﻿No, we won't leave, Mr Kodama. We'll take you to Kansai with us. What do you say? When you get used to things, ﻿you'll have to come here by yourselves. ﻿You want to save some time ﻿for your girlfriend? ﻿I don't have one. What I mean is... ﻿we have other staff, ﻿and they all work hard. ﻿They buy lunch with the money they earn. ﻿Please don't say anything more. ﻿We got it. Right, Yukari? ﻿Thank you for paying. ﻿We won't be a burden to you, Mr Kodama. ﻿All right, then. ﻿First of all, let's hear from Kaiji. ﻿Are they about five centimetres? ﻿No, more than that. ﻿Yeah, they're about ﻿nine and a half centimetres. ﻿Aren't they ten centimetres? ﻿The Tama River has ten centimetres carp, ﻿so we can build there. ﻿Why all the carp talk? ﻿Adjacent high-rise buildings ﻿in the suburbs... ﻿could affect wind flow and the ecosystem. ﻿I know, but it's the same ﻿for all developments. ﻿It's our task to create units ﻿with stunning high-rise view. ﻿We have other tasks too. ﻿Like reviving factory towns... ﻿and regional development. ﻿The countryside's ﻿a wasteful investment now. Go to the Coldplay concert... ﻿return to your riverside apartment ﻿and unwind with a glass of wine. ﻿That's the ideal city life. ﻿Am I right, Komachi? Be honest! ﻿Not for me. ﻿I've never really thought about my lifestyle. ﻿He's right, Kaiji. ﻿Everyone has his or her own lifestyle. ﻿For me, I love having coffee milk ﻿in a sauna most. ﻿The financing application fell through. ﻿They refuse to loan us seventy million yen. ﻿If Kitashinagawa Bank won't, ﻿then who will? ﻿It's tricky. With new machines and our skills, ﻿we could make anything. Did they mention about laying off staff? ﻿Yeah, they even drew up their own plan. ﻿But we don't do that to our staff. ﻿We can cut iron, ﻿but can we cut people too? ﻿Kodama, it's okay to fire us. ﻿Don't say that! ﻿Your future is still ahead of you. Do we still have a future? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿If we keep the cost down, we'll all be fine. ﻿Let's go. Really? ﻿So we live close by. ﻿That's great. Can I drop by ﻿if I run out of something? ﻿But I don't have any cologne. ﻿You don't? Times must be hard. It's not that. I only said that because it's ﻿more amusing than saying soy sauce. ﻿You don't have to explain. ﻿Anyway, what's your hobby? ﻿To be honest... I love trains. ﻿Taking trains, enjoying the scenery ﻿and listening to music. ﻿By the way, I caught a weird train ﻿on a work trip to Fukui. "The Bread Train"? —What's that? —﻿I never heard of it before. ﻿You pick up on the train, but not my job? ﻿So you sell glasses? ﻿Let me know if you need any. ﻿Even if it's just for cosmetic use. No 3D glasses? ﻿I'll like trains too, trust me. ﻿Trust you? I﻿t's okay, it's okay. Huh? What's okay? ﻿—A martini please. ﻿—Sure. ﻿—Shaken more than usual. ﻿—Yes, Ma'am. ﻿Don't worry. I'll pay for my share. ﻿I hate being treated. ﻿Well? H﻿ow is it so far? ﻿You like me, don't you? Here we go, it's Parlata Kamata's ﻿famous "handkerchief drop." ﻿Who will our butterfly of the evening, ﻿Momiji, descend upon? ﻿Will she drop her handkerchief, ﻿or her heart? ﻿She's made her choice! ﻿Will he catch Momiji in time? ﻿He caught her! ﻿This kid doesn't take after me, ﻿He's super-restrained. He is! ﻿You can't come to a place like this ﻿after what happened today, he said. Like this? Poor baby. That's not what I said! ﻿But he's a point, it's a bit odd. ﻿Listen, her name's Benibana. ﻿Introduce me to one of your rich customers. ﻿Your boyfriend will do. ﻿Well, what exactly do you guys make? ﻿At our factory, we weld iron... Hello, gentlemen! ﻿—This is Akebono. —﻿Not the sumo wrestler though. ﻿I'm skinny, but they call me Akebono. ﻿Nice to meet you! ﻿Miss Akebono... ﻿please be his girlfriend. This is ridiculous. ﻿We haven't even talked yet? ﻿Even a place like this has rules. Anyway, how many carats is your necklace? - What? - That's my son. How many carats is that dress? What? You're so silly! He's funny! ﻿I understand how you feel. ﻿Yes, everyone feels the same... I'm very sorry! ﻿What a mess! ﻿A defect has been found ﻿in the piping of this building... ﻿so it's going to be rebuilt. So? ﻿You can't be here when it's torn down. What? ﻿So when do you want me out? ﻿As soon as possible. ﻿Where will you go? ﻿I'll wait it out in Kitakata. Oh, Kitakata... ﻿It's famous for the "SL Banetsu Monogatari Express". ﻿Most people would say ﻿it's famous for ramen noodles. ﻿I wish I'd known you earlier! ﻿It would have made living here ﻿more fun. What a shame. ﻿So you'll move out, right? ﻿How is it? ﻿Excuse me, would you mind jumping? Oh, ok. ﻿A little higher. ﻿Two or three times more. ﻿Got it, Thanks. ﻿Well, that's about it. ﻿You work in real estate, don't you? ﻿What? No... ﻿Hi there. ﻿Hi there! ﻿Oh. hello. ﻿We met on the Watarase Line. ﻿You were with a cute girl. ﻿What happened to her after that? You were with those reggae guys. ﻿It looked like you were having fun. I ﻿envied you. ﻿Surely you're not taking a trip ﻿on this train too? ﻿No, it's not a trip... but not a commute either. ﻿They even call it "Train View". ﻿It means you can watch trains ﻿from your window. I see. ﻿There are homes built ﻿with that concept in mind, right? Yes, there are. ﻿I work for Nozomi Estate. ﻿Why do you need ﻿to look for an apartment then? ﻿I can't relax in my company's units. ﻿That place has a great train view. ﻿Let's take a look. ﻿Please, take a seat. ﻿Many people avoid such places ﻿due to the noise, but I like it. ﻿The Utsunomiya Line runs first ﻿in the morning... ...at about 5:15 am. ﻿Over there is the Tohoku Bullet Train. ﻿Even just watching it in summer ﻿cools me down. ﻿What music do you listen to then? ﻿﻿I don't need music. ﻿The motor sound of an EF510 ﻿pulling a Hokutosei train is enough. ﻿I understand. ﻿Made from Kawasaki Heavy Industries iron. ﻿It would go well with ﻿Milt Jackson's vibraphone. ﻿The tune is... "Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise". ﻿I've never thought of it that way. ﻿I'm quite impressed. ﻿One of our staff quit, so... ﻿I appreciate it. ﻿I know nothing about iron but... thanks for the room. In exchange... ...you can teach my son ﻿the tricks of your trade. ﻿He's never been outside of Kamata. ﻿I ride trains on weekends. ﻿But you never meet girls. ﻿Do you know any nice girls? ﻿There must be plenty in Marunouchi. ﻿Well, um... nice girls? ﻿I don't know about that either. ﻿Then let's visit the ﻿Kamata and Oimachi hostesses. ﻿We'll have a party! My son's too timid. ﻿Dad! Don't blurt out my weaknesses. ﻿It's not fatherly. ﻿Excuse... you? ﻿It should have been us to leave. ﻿We're sorry, boss. You must take home with you ﻿your knowledge. ﻿You can't make a single bolt yet, can you? Neither can I. ﻿—You don't need to. ﻿—﻿You've got great off-spec smarts. ﻿Like an advance investment. ﻿—Now. about the hostesses... ﻿—Dad! Papa! ﻿Even after 5:00 pm, he's still our boss! ﻿Darn, I licked my pencil. ﻿—What time...? ﻿—Dad! ﻿—Mr Komachi! Good morning. ﻿—Good morning, Midori. ﻿I took the subway exit you told me about... ...﻿so I made the concert on time. You're better than GPS. ﻿—I'm flattered. ﻿—It's all I'm good at. You're good at being yourself. ﻿Is that a compliment? Oh... no. ﻿I guess it is. I understand. ﻿But President... ﻿hitting under 100 ﻿on that course was superb. ﻿Never mind my score. ﻿The clubhouse's fried prawns... ﻿...were puffy and not properly cooked. P﻿resident, perhaps ordering seafood ﻿in the mountains was a bad idea. ﻿That's true. My mistake. Come in. Excuse me. ﻿—Good morning. ﻿—Morning. ﻿These are the minutes ﻿from the last meeting. ﻿Someone's against high-rise buildings? Yes, that's Komachi Kei ﻿in planning division. ﻿High-rise apartments ﻿are our flagship enterprise. ﻿How could he oppose them? ﻿I admire his guts. Did he know that senior management ﻿would see this? ﻿I believe so. ﻿He might be well-suited for our venture project. ﻿It's all due to a footbridge ﻿overlooking the Keikyu tracks. ﻿Some nights, ﻿I just stood there until I got sleepy. ﻿Yeah, that's it. ﻿If it hadn't been nearby, I don't know ﻿if I'd have become a train fan. Did you obsess over ﻿train spec differences? ﻿Yeah, my dad taught me. ﻿The 800 series had a higher gear ratio... ...﻿to cover short distances between stations. ﻿I knew that too. I ﻿was surprised to see Inokashira ﻿trains on the Asanogawa Line. ﻿Of course they were second-hand... ﻿but the stations are close together... ﻿so Inokashira Line trains ﻿were a perfect fit. ﻿You listen to music ﻿on the train, don't you? ﻿Isn't a mix of natural sounds, ﻿the train, and the tracks better? ﻿That will indeed be ﻿a purer travel experience... ﻿...but I enjoy it in my way. Music sets me apart. You know, there are so many train fans. ﻿So I want to do something ﻿that suits my style. Your style? Yes. ﻿I tried to find my style somewhere else. ﻿Where was that? ﻿The Thunder Dolphin coaster ﻿at Tokyo Dome City. I ﻿was listening to Led Zeppelin's ﻿"Immigrant Song." ﻿I nearly died. ﻿I think I know what you mean. ﻿I'd like to try that too. ﻿What turned you on to trains? ﻿Well... ﻿This may sound trite... ﻿but it was the transport museum. ﻿I went with a school friend... ﻿and was moved that people actually ﻿ride these wonderful machines. ﻿—I get you... ﻿—I thought you would. ﻿I see. I see. ﻿I'm a train fan too. ﻿Of station meals, I should say. ﻿Which ones are the best? ﻿Let me see... ﻿Lately the Miyajima eel meal, ﻿the Imabari eel meal... ﻿and the Takamatsu eel meal ﻿have gotten tastier. ﻿That's a lot of eel. ﻿Eels... they electrify. ﻿Mr Kodama... ﻿that was a pun, wasn't it? ﻿Ah, you caught me by surprise! ﻿That's quite rare. ﻿Anyway, please reconsider our loan. ﻿I think you know our capabilities, ﻿so why isn't it possible? ﻿For years, ﻿our bank prioritised ﻿know-how over collateral... ﻿because of our prior president. ﻿But starting from this year, ﻿we have a new president. ﻿Please understand. ﻿Personally, I wish I could help ﻿your company more. ﻿So that's how it is. ﻿Like this... ﻿keep turning it, don't stop. Yes. ﻿Right, that's it. ﻿Boss, how about me? ﻿Sure, let me see. ﻿Look, do it as you turn it. ﻿—Yes. ﻿—Like that. ﻿That's it. ﻿Next one is 120kph. ﻿A Keikyu Rapid Express. "﻿Excuse me!". ﻿You meant to say "okay," right? ﻿Yukari, this is a Yoyogi-Shinjuku ﻿Yamanote train, a slow ball. ﻿Get out of here! The train's faster! ﻿Acty, here's your favourite, ﻿a Hanshin train. ﻿A Sannomiya-Umeda Limited Express. ﻿Top speed 110kph! ﻿Just like Hanshin. It's fast! ﻿About metres ahead, turn left. ﻿Next, turn right. ﻿You've reached your destination. ﻿Can I help you? ﻿This is Kodama Iron Works, right? ﻿Well, today's Sunday. We're closed. ﻿I came to visit... ﻿Oh, I see! That's nice. ﻿He'll be playing catch ﻿down by the Tama River. What should I do then...? ﻿Don't say a word. ﻿I know everything. ﻿I'm Kodama Tetsuo, Kenta's father. ﻿I own the iron works. ﻿I'll show you the way. Follow me. ﻿See those two playing catch? ﻿They could play anywhere ﻿on this narrow riverbank... ...﻿but they only go there. Call them naive or just ignorant. A﻿nyway, go give them hell. ﻿Come on, don't be shy. ﻿Kenta, what are you doing? ﻿She came all the way to see you. ﻿You came for Komachi, ﻿and Dad got the wrong idea. ﻿That sounds like something he'd do. ﻿He's good with iron, but not with women. ﻿That applies to me too. So where's Komachi? ﻿He's looking for an apartment again. ﻿He can't stay with us forever. ﻿That's true. ﻿He told me he wanted to stay forever. ﻿Really? ﻿Is that true? ﻿What's up? I think you should ﻿consider her feelings more. ﻿But I'm not her. I don't know. ﻿How so? ﻿For instance, what was she wearing? ﻿A cute flowery dress, I think. ﻿Would you wear it? ﻿Why say that? ﻿I'm not into that. ﻿Don't get the wrong idea. I﻿'m just saying that we can't understand ﻿how women feel after all. ﻿Like when we first met, ﻿I was with a girl, remember? ﻿She dumped me after that. ﻿She said I like trains more than her. ﻿Women and trains aren't the same. ﻿Is that so? ﻿Maybe there were other reasons... ﻿but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. ﻿The girl is pretty though. ﻿She must like you very much ﻿to come all the way here. ﻿Good morning, Komachi. ﻿Found a place yet? ﻿Good morning. It's not easy. ﻿But it's fun to look for one. ﻿You know what I mean? ﻿Actually, I know a great place ﻿in Shirogane. ﻿Only 100,000 yen for employees. ﻿Shirogane Landscape House? ﻿It's close to shops, ﻿and with Sheraton Hotel spa access. ﻿—﻿Are you impressed? ﻿—No trains though. ﻿Oh gosh, don't you know? ﻿There's the Namboku subway line. ﻿But you can't see it, or hear it. ﻿Oh, I love the Tokyo Metro. ﻿It's a great shortcut through town. ﻿You don't say. Midori? Coming. Yes? ﻿Did you tell Komachi ﻿about that special vacancy? ﻿Yes, I just met him in the lobby. ﻿—And? ﻿—He turned it down flat. ﻿Really? He turned it down? I﻿'m glad. He doesn't need ﻿a place in Tokyo anymore. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿You've got a thing for him, right? ﻿I like him... a little. ﻿Komachi, found a place yet? ﻿Not yet. ﻿Good. ﻿It might be for the best. ﻿It may rain this evening. Look. For 315 yen a month, ﻿you can check the weather radar. ﻿It's accurate. ﻿Have you got an umbrella? ﻿Chief, please say what you need to say. ﻿Never mind the weather. ﻿Well... ﻿Komachi, you've been ﻿transferred to Kyushu. ﻿They have problems with some ﻿leisure projects and apartments... so they want a fresh pair of hands. ﻿I'm sorry... ﻿Will you go? ﻿To Kyushu? ﻿I've always wanted to go! ﻿Komachi, it's not a vacation. ﻿You act so pleased. I know! It's the gateway to Asia! ﻿It will be a challenge! ﻿I didn't know how you'd take it. ﻿I was gambling a bit. ﻿But never mind the job, ﻿won't the move be a problem? ﻿A problem? Not at all! I'll do my best! What about your girlfriend? No problem. ﻿That's for the best too. ﻿This is great. ﻿Actually, I've been posted to Fukuoka. Fukuoka? ﻿Is that... good or bad? ﻿To me, it's good. It's Kyushu. ﻿I can ride the trains there. ﻿I see. ﻿Nothing fazes you, right? ﻿But isn't working in Tokyo ﻿the main line to success? ﻿Well, the main line... ﻿In Keio terms, I'm on the Keibajo Line. ﻿In Keikyu terms, that'd be the Daishi Line. ﻿It's good that you take pride in your work. ﻿—I don't have any. ﻿—That's not true. ﻿You're cool. You'll be a hit in Kyushu. ﻿It will be good for you. Komachi. Oh, Midori. ﻿What a coincidence to meet you here. ﻿What a shame... I'm not here by myself. ﻿Oh, am I interrupting? ﻿Not at all. ﻿You're awful. ﻿This is my mother, Inaho. ﻿I'm Komachi. ﻿Midori and I work in the same company. ﻿Oh, isn't Inaho the name of ﻿the Niigata-Akita express? ﻿Isn't the Tokyo-Akita bullet train ﻿called Komachi? ﻿That’s right. ﻿You two, please! ﻿Was the bookstore fun? ﻿Yes, I haven't bought ﻿so much books in a while. ﻿I'd buy them online. Books are heavy. ﻿Are you feeling unwell? ﻿You're in a bad mood. ﻿Why did you call me so late? ﻿Not a good time, is it? You’ll be angry. I won't. ﻿There's nothing between us anyway. ﻿There's no reason to get angry. ﻿So you figured it out. ﻿I did. ﻿You're marrying her. ﻿Who? ﻿You seem honest, so her mom likes you too. ﻿Wait, you've got it wrong. I'll explain. ﻿Sure, let's hear it. ﻿I'm moving to Fukuoka. ﻿You can't... ﻿I'll be so lonely! ﻿That's a demotion. ﻿Did you do something wrong? ﻿It's okay. You can work your way back. ﻿I guess. ﻿I think it's a good thing. ﻿We'll be far apart, but ﻿only five hours by bullet train. ﻿It's just an hour or so by plane, silly you! Komachi! ﻿Welcome! ﻿Are you tired? You're fine? ﻿I didn't expect you to come, sir. ﻿We're on a bad streak here in Kyushu. ﻿Everyone has to get stuck in. ﻿I was the only one free. ﻿A few people are transferred here ﻿from Tokyo... ﻿but you are the first one ﻿to come by bullet train. ﻿You either love bullet trains, ﻿or you take it easy. ﻿It's both. ﻿I love all kinds of trains. ﻿Welcome to Nozomi Estate Hakata's ﻿best staff apartment. ﻿It overlooks the whole bay. ﻿It has a great view, ﻿and the bay is beautiful. ﻿It will be better if there's a seaside line. ﻿For me, this is the sea. When I was a kid, I would take ﻿the train here to air my loneliness. ﻿You never told me that before. ﻿—Have we been here before? ﻿—We did! ﻿I had to tell you so many times ﻿that this isn't a beach! ﻿Actually, I come here sometimes too. ﻿Really? Is that so? ﻿Like father, like son. ﻿If only we had new machines... ﻿Loan us some money! ﻿Don't follow me. ﻿I'm thinking about dinner. ﻿Nothing but recipes. ﻿Loan us some money! ﻿This is our hitman from Tokyo, ﻿Komachi Kei. ﻿Please make him feel welcome. ﻿I'm Komachi Kei. Well... ﻿I'll work hard to support ﻿Nozomi Estate in Kyushu. ﻿I have a lot to learn, but I'll do my best! ﻿Watch out for Nakasu babes! ﻿I like riding trains while ﻿enjoying music and the scenery. ﻿Just so you know. Try the Hitahikosan Line. ﻿Who said that? ﻿Now that introductions are over, ﻿let's start our morning exercises. ﻿It will limber up your mind too. ﻿She's exercising? ﻿This works wonders ﻿on my poor old shoulders. President... ﻿did you take hyaluronic acid yesterday? ﻿Of course not! Only Peking Duck and jellyfish soup. ﻿It must be the collagen then! ﻿You look radiant. ﻿Your beauty brings me joy. ﻿Did Komachi take the Hakata ﻿apartment without a hitch? ﻿I know him. ﻿He'd like to choose for himself... but he's in no position to. ﻿Plus, that unit would be wasted on staff. ﻿But the occupancy rate's only 70% ﻿despite the setting and fixtures. ﻿That seems to be a problem. That's why I wanted him to move in. ﻿As a monitor, his criticism ﻿would be most convincing. ﻿—I'm Oki. ﻿—I'm Taku. ﻿—I'm Kamiyamada. ﻿—I'm Kirishima. —He's cute. ﻿—Yes, he is! ﻿I'm Ariake. ﻿People in Tokyo won't understand... ﻿but flattering words don't work here. ﻿Hard work is the key. ﻿But you'll come to enjoy it. ﻿Let me take you out at night. ﻿Thanks, but I'm not a night person. ﻿We work all day just to enjoy the night. ﻿Take the midnight sun ﻿in Scandinavia for example. ﻿The nights never end. ﻿I'm Kumagawa. ﻿So you're from Tokyo. ﻿I want to go to Tokyo. ﻿Will you fly there? ﻿Or take the bullet train? ﻿Or you prefer bus? Anyway, nice to meet you. ﻿I'm Nichirin. ﻿I'll show you our problem. ﻿It's not our fault though. ﻿The head office makes the decisions. We're here just to clean up. Ti﻿mes are bad too.... ...but we're doing our best. ﻿—You and Nichirin can go take a look. ﻿—Okay. That'd be a good spot for the industrial site. We were eyeing for it too. But the landowner's really stubborn and wouldn't listen to us. ﻿What's your hobby, Nichirin? ﻿Soccer, I guess. What position? Goalkeeper. ﻿You surprised me. ﻿Once, I saved a free kick ﻿by Cristiano Ronaldo. ﻿You're talking about video games? ﻿Now I get you. Actually, I played as ﻿Nakamura Shunsuke once too. ﻿You play video games too? ﻿They can be surprisingly useful for work. ﻿I play them to forget about work. ﻿By the way, ﻿is this place completely dead? We haven't built anything yet... ...﻿but we bought it at a knockdown price. It's a good buy, but... ﻿You're saying it right. ﻿At night, this place looks like ﻿a scene from Resident Evil. Resident... Evil! ﻿Have you got a split personality? ﻿What’s this place supposed to be? ﻿It should have been Hot Shots Golf... ﻿but I guess it turned into ﻿Nobunaga's Ambition. Nichirin! Nichi! ﻿Are you okay? Komachi... ﻿It's not often to see ﻿a small matchmaking party like this! ﻿Isn't this all for you? ﻿Don't tease your father, Kenta. ﻿Your father and I were on the ﻿school council in junior high. ﻿Actually, I used to work ﻿at a hostess club in Hiratsuka. ﻿Now I have a real estate license ﻿and I can support my mother. ﻿I'm impressed. ﻿How did you find time to study for it? ﻿Let's not talk about the past. ﻿We both love hostesses. I... It's not good to go there. ﻿But to work there is fine. ﻿What's your hobby? ﻿My hobby? ﻿Crystals, perhaps. ﻿Crystals? ﻿Not tourmaline or biotite? ﻿We'll leave you to it. ﻿Yes, let's eat. ﻿What's your hobby? ﻿Do you prefer driving to this? ﻿No, this is fun too. ﻿That's all? ﻿Are you upset? ﻿This is fun. ﻿If you were driving... ...﻿we couldn't do this. ﻿Ayame, I'll crash! ﻿—It's not a car. ﻿—No, my heart will crash. ﻿You're... ﻿more passionate than I expected. ﻿When I'm with the right guy... ﻿Tee hee hee, huh? ﻿It seems that... our heartbeats match ﻿the sound of the engine. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I'm so tired! ﻿I haven't run uphill ﻿since elementary school. ﻿You seem fine though. ﻿It's lovely here. The air's fresh too. ﻿Let's eat over there. ﻿Sure. ﻿You did well to pick a spot ﻿in an area so spacious. ﻿The sun will sink into the west, right? ﻿In an hour, you'll see. It will only be shining there. ﻿Have you ever thought of ﻿becoming a meteorologist? Anyway, let's go. ﻿Did you make these? ﻿I did. ﻿What do you think of this ﻿riceball lunchbox? Ayame... It is amazing. ﻿Here you go. ﻿Thank you. I'm so happy! It's delicious. How was it? For Sonic Foods. ﻿Getting an appointment with ﻿the president's never easy. ﻿Even after all these years. ﻿I'm sure he'd take to ﻿a Kyushu native like you. You couldn't get a chance to meet him? ﻿We could try bribes or women. ﻿By using a bait, he might bite. ﻿I'm sure he goes to ﻿the clubs in Nakasu too. ﻿The head office is on our backs ﻿regarding Sonic Foods. ﻿It's the only company ﻿around here that is doing well. ﻿If only they'd at least ﻿give us a chance to talk. It's too bad. ﻿So, where's Komachi's report? He's pointed out a problem ﻿with the hallway garbage chute. ﻿It's convenient, but the opening's small ﻿and it takes time to open it. ﻿The building itself is important... but we need to pay attention ﻿to such details too. ﻿Also, we have a problem! ﻿Our Kyushu branch says... the president of Sonic Foods ﻿will meet us only if we go to him. In other words, only if you go ﻿to Kyushu to meet him personally. ﻿He won't cross the Kanmon Straits ﻿to do business. President! ﻿If he'll only meet with you.... ..I think ﻿we should put away our pride and do it. Our rivals... Well, they don't ﻿have a female president... ﻿So that's it! ﻿He's probably just shy. ﻿Some motherly love might work. Motherly or fatherly, whatever works. We have no choice but to ﻿go to Hakata, I'll join you. Midori! We're scrambling ﻿from next Monday. ﻿So whatever comes up... ﻿Tokyo business ﻿takes a back seat, understand? ﻿Anyway, is Hakata blowfish ﻿still in season? President, you can count on me ﻿for food and drink in Nakasu. ﻿—Nakasu is your forte? ﻿—Yes. And for you... ingest lots of hyaluronic acid ﻿and collagen for your skin. How about terrapin for dinner? Terrapin! - ﻿That sounds great! I... - You're not coming... - No. I am... - No. ﻿Has their president met Komachi? ﻿That's silly! Of course not! ﻿You like Komachi... ﻿A little, yes. ﻿Here you go. ﻿This is hard for me to say... ﻿but our children can't get married. ﻿So Kenta is unsuitable. ﻿I think he's a rare type these days though. ﻿No, he's a good person, ﻿which is why my daughter feels bad. ﻿During the time she quit hostessing ﻿and got her license... ﻿she was a man's mistress. ﻿She still works at his company now. ﻿Can't she end it? ﻿That's why she decided ﻿to go through with the date. ﻿But Kenta... ﻿You might say that he lacks impact. ﻿Being a nice guy isn't enough for her. Is that so? ﻿He's looking forward to ﻿their next date. What a shame. ﻿Well... ﻿how about me? As Kenta's wife? No... ﻿yours. ﻿To tell you the truth... I've had feelings for you since junior high. ﻿Are you serious? ﻿I... I can't forget my late wife. ﻿That's why I visit hostesses. ﻿Why don't you quit? ﻿They... reinforce my iron. ﻿So I'm afraid marriage is... ﻿I'm finished. ﻿—Mother. ﻿—Don't call her that. ﻿Well, I'll remember you as ﻿a bite on my little finger. ﻿Excuse me. —Say hi to Ayame for me. ﻿—That's enough. ﻿This is Hakata Station. ﻿Thank you for travelling with us. ﻿So you got a rail pass. ﻿No bullet trains. I envy you. ﻿Something to drink? ﻿Strawberry milk with condensed milk. ﻿Just kidding. ﻿Tea is fine. Here you go. ﻿You’re kidding me. ﻿Milk helps to soothe a broken heart. ﻿You seem to see right through me. ﻿Sometimes, cheap things ﻿or spending time doing nothing... bring peace to the heart. ﻿Isn't that wonderful? ﻿She turned me down. ﻿Honestly, this got me down. ﻿She was nice. ﻿I thought it was going well. ﻿Remember what I told you? ﻿Only women understand ﻿how women feel. ﻿It's best not to think about ﻿things you can't understand. ﻿It must have hurt you deeply. ﻿Really deep. ﻿What a great view. ﻿If only there's a seaside line. ﻿You love that, don't you? ﻿Music and scenery together... ﻿it's fantastic! You heard me? ﻿Then answer this. ﻿The sound of this KiHa E200 ﻿on twenty-five meter rails... ﻿is it "gatan gatan..." ﻿or "darara darara...?" dararara dara"? ﻿Don't you think it's interesting? ﻿Rather than being obsessed with ﻿what model this diesel train is... ﻿or where it was made... ﻿I prefer to enjoy the view and the music. ﻿Sure, to each his own. ﻿But isn't it sad riding together ﻿without talking? ﻿Then you should have said so. ﻿She still dumped me even though ﻿I did things her way. So that's it. ﻿You're being true to yourself. I get it. ﻿When you take a winding track... ﻿rather than walk straight ahead.. ﻿it's less tiring to zig and zag, isn't it? ﻿That's the switchback method. Switchback? T-back? Chikugo, you are so knowledgeable! ﻿I'm a railfan. ﻿That kind of thing is like ABC to me. ﻿You won't read about that ﻿in the newspapers. You won't...! ﻿They really should write about it. ﻿We can get out that way. ﻿There it is...! ﻿It should be this way. ﻿It's... a C11... No... there's an eighty-six there. ﻿I can't see a thing. ﻿Not a thing. ﻿No, I see it. I can see it too. ﻿A shiny black locomotive! Amazing. ﻿Would you mind taking a photo for us? ﻿Here's the camera. ﻿Let's go there. Thanks! ﻿Let me take yours too. ﻿—We're... ﻿—Yes. please. Smile! ﻿Do you guys always travel together? ﻿It's great to have a friend like that. ﻿You don't look like students. ﻿Where do you work? ﻿It's our day off. ﻿Let's not mention about work. You're lucky with a girl on each arm. ﻿This is cheaper than taking them ﻿to eat at a swanky hotel. ﻿So you like trains? Sí. ﻿That's an HO Scale Club gold badge! You know it! ﻿You like model trains too? ﻿I've got no money to build them, ﻿but I know how. ﻿No kidding! ﻿That's great! ﻿I'm Kodama from Kyushu Electric. ﻿Just kidding. Now, let's repair it. ﻿Your controller’s broken. ﻿The maintenance period's expired, ﻿and I've been busy at work. ﻿I haven't seen it working ﻿in a while. It's a shame. ﻿Knowledge of machines is an asset. ﻿He can tell you the model ﻿of a train just by listening. ﻿He also knows the maker of ﻿any train. It's not art. ﻿I've always wanted an HO scale. ﻿I could make one but not play with one. ﻿Here I go. ﻿Amazing! You're really good! I﻿'ve got lots of other trains. ﻿Want to see? ﻿Yes. please! ﻿This is amazing. ﻿You've got Keikyu too! ﻿He does! ﻿It's even a Keikyu 2000 series! ﻿He's big fan of Keikyu. ﻿Seeing one at a crossing ﻿makes him tear up. ﻿The TCS connector's broken. Luckily I have one with me. ﻿Now we'll have power. ﻿That's great! Thanks! ﻿Can we run the Keikyu ﻿and a Blue Train together? ﻿The lines don't intersect ﻿like they do at Shinagawa though. ﻿You know about that too? I'm moved! ﻿I saw the trains intersect once! ﻿I'm jealous! ﻿We'll never be able to see that again! ﻿I'll change the couplers. ﻿Mr Chikugo, Kyushu Electric ﻿has restored power! ﻿Trains departing! ﻿Fantastic! ﻿It's coming... ﻿This is just grand... ﻿This is just grand. ﻿"Fukuoka Airport Domestic Terminal" ﻿Welcome, ma'am... Yufuin. You didn't make one ﻿of your pennants this time. President, I have it right here! ﻿Let's head straight to Sonic Foods. ﻿President, before that, you have ﻿to partake of a hearty meal. ﻿First, you wolf down Goma saba ﻿with tea on rice at Tenjin. ﻿After that, you gulp down ﻿some ginseng tea. ﻿Then thirty minutes at a beauty salon.. ﻿Ariake, do you know of a good salon? ﻿Hold on, you only know ﻿of that kind of salon. ﻿Most of the staff here are local people. ﻿However, they undergo rigorous training. ﻿Our president's concept is ﻿to keep the elite here in Kyushu... so we usually don't have ﻿much to do with Tokyo. ﻿I'm so glad he's taking ﻿time out to meet us today! ﻿The ginseng tea's working! ﻿Pleased to meet you. ﻿You're not taking a photo? ﻿Oh! Photo... ﻿Excuse us. ﻿Hey, not with your cell phones! Ah, thank you! Here, take it! ﻿It's a digital camera... ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Ready? ﻿Okay then, say "cheese!" ﻿How did you come today? By plane. What's wrong? ﻿Anyway. I've set aside an hour. ﻿For Nozomi Estate. We're honoured. ﻿May we organise ﻿some evening entertainment for you? Of course! It's galling. We did our best ﻿to get a result. Your effort hasn't gone to waste. ﻿It's why we've come this far. Excuse me. Komachi, make yourself available tonight. ﻿Our president's in town. ﻿She came from Tokyo? ﻿Do you know Sonic Foods? ﻿Yes, I've heard of them. They're taking her to Nakasu. ﻿You want me to go? Wouldn’t Ariake be better? ﻿Apparently, our president ﻿wants to see you. ﻿Me? ﻿I don't get any of this. ﻿Anyway, let me teach you ﻿some Nakasu lingo. ﻿Come with me. Thank you. It's the first time for me. ﻿Yeah, right. ﻿—Sir. may I make a toast? ﻿—Sure. ﻿—Okay, cheers everyone! ﻿—Cheers! ﻿Cheers to you too, ma'am. ﻿Ah, delicious! ﻿Exceptional! ﻿—You're cute! ﻿—Thank you. ﻿Is blowfish out of season? ﻿President, you have to wait ﻿until the sumo starts. Right? ﻿You'll have to hold your breath! ﻿Excuse me. ﻿There's a call for you, sir. For me? Who could it be? ﻿Excuse me, please. I see. ﻿I'll talk it over with her. Listen... ﻿It's wonderful that the ﻿Fukuoka Airport is so nearby. ﻿But there's the bullet train too. ﻿I go to Hakata Station often. ﻿Excuse me, Ma'am. Your colleague is asking for you. ﻿Mr Chikugo, please excuse me. ﻿I must attend to some other matters. Finally! That's business. "Kei Komachi". ﻿Komachi! Komachi! What are you doing? ﻿Hurry up, they're waiting! ﻿Oh, it's this way. ﻿I just spotted a club ﻿named after an express train. ﻿This is bad. ﻿Our subsidiaries can't handle ﻿intricate work like that. ﻿Sonic Foods want technical skill, ﻿not real estate. ﻿Then we have to ﻿reach out from our group... and find a new subcontractor. ﻿Let's hit two more clubs... ﻿and then if necessary, ﻿we’ll have to use your charms. Got it. With him on board... ﻿—Kyushu will be ours. ﻿—Exactly. ﻿Ma'am, this is Komachi. Komachi! Good to see you. It's been a while. ﻿I need to talk with Amagi, ﻿so please join them. ﻿The most important man in Kyushu, ﻿Mr Chikugo is here. ﻿So watch yourself. ﻿Good luck. ﻿This way please. ﻿Excuse me. Hey, it's that guy! So you're President Chikugo! ﻿Of course I knew your name... ﻿but I'm still new here... ﻿Sit! Sit! ﻿Come on, sit! ﻿Excuse me. ﻿This is great! We're reunited. ﻿That's right. ﻿Lucky we took a photo together. ﻿I've got it here. ﻿Look at this...! ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Komachi, you know Mr Chikugo? ﻿What a coincidence! ﻿You're not from Kyushu, are you? ﻿Everyone's her so let's have a toast. ﻿A toast! Splendid! ﻿Please have seat, ma'am. All right, a toast. Ready, Sir? ﻿—Cheers! ﻿—Cheers! Ma'am...! ﻿From what I can tell... ...﻿it seems like they are an item. ﻿An item? ﻿They're having fun ﻿talking about their hobby. We'd better keep our mouths shut. ﻿So what should we do? So, for us, we pretend we're drunk... ﻿and have fun with the hostesses... so those two can be alone. ﻿Isn't that your specialty? ﻿Is it...? ﻿So, Komachi, have you ever ﻿taken a sleeper train? Yes. ﻿On the top or bottom? ﻿Mostly on top. ﻿In my day, we had three together. ﻿Welcome, welcome. ﻿Welcome, welcome. Ami! Ami! Ami! Ami! Ami! ﻿Buying land and hoarding it, then abandoning it in a recession... we won't stand for it! Ignoring good advice ﻿on such a pretense is unforgivable! ﻿That's easy for you to say. ﻿I won't accept that! ﻿It was a short stay, but it was fun. Please come for New Year's day ﻿or summer festival. ﻿I'll work harder for that. ﻿I need your help! ﻿—I can stay longer? ﻿﻿—Yes! The technical skills that ﻿Mr Chikugo's company needs... ﻿are right up Kodama Iron Works' alley. ﻿You didn't have to go so far to help us. ﻿Fixing model trains isn't enough. ﻿You have to reveal your other talents. ﻿Let's do this! ﻿Come in. Excuse me. ﻿Oh, so it's you! No badge today? ﻿This is work. ﻿I'll thoroughly review your proposal. ﻿Of course. ﻿Thank you for considering us. ﻿The product's a citrus fruit, ﻿a Kyushu specialty. We need precision components ﻿to fully extract its nutrients. ﻿Here. ﻿Sorry, Komachi. Your factory site offer ﻿will have to wait. ﻿We need to find the right equipment first. ﻿Over to you. ﻿—Thank you. ﻿—Thank you. ﻿These are the plans ﻿for the components. ﻿How's this, factory chief? ﻿It's perfect! ﻿And it can be achieved ﻿only with cutting technology. ﻿This will solve our yuzu problems. Boss! You said "yuzu"... Yuzu... Yuzu... Ex-yuzu me! ﻿Now for the factory site. ﻿Find us a good one, Komachi. ﻿Yes, Sir. Hello? ﻿Remember me? It's Azusa. Ah... What? You're in Kyushu too? You should have told me. ﻿You're the only one I can rely on. I ﻿can't figure out how I feel ﻿without seeing Komachi. ﻿Or say what I want to say. Got it. Tell me when you arrive in Kyushu. ﻿I'll do what I can. ﻿Mr Hayatono! ﻿This land is vital for ﻿the future of Kyushu! ﻿Don't try to fool me. They're thinking of ﻿shutting the railway down. ﻿If so, who'd work at a factory ﻿way out here? ﻿Most of all, it would ﻿provide jobs for the local people. ﻿That way, this railway would be saved. ﻿Seeing your land near this railway... ﻿I thought it'd be good ﻿to build a factory here. Please consider about it. ﻿It would be a shame ﻿to lose this railway. ﻿Hey, if you want my land... you got to be able to keep up with me. ﻿You're pathetic. ﻿Prove to me that you want it! ﻿Did he just call me pathetic? Komachi? You're at it early. You have time to run? ﻿Right now, this is my job. ﻿I've got to do it. I'm off to Chikugo's factory. See you later. That's the best you can do? I ﻿thought a new factory ﻿would be impossible right now. ﻿But it will be great for ﻿providing local jobs. ﻿It will be a fine workplace. Especially ﻿with you and Mr Chikugo in charge. ﻿He has been misunderstood. ﻿I imagine your company's technology ﻿is highly regarded even in Tokyo? It ought to be. ﻿—Excuse me... ﻿—Please go ahead. ﻿Hello? It's Ayame, the girl who turned you down. ﻿So you're in Hakata? ﻿I am too. Do you want to meet? ﻿Meet you? Can I do that? I ﻿came to see my father... ﻿but what are you doing here? ﻿I'm seeing a friend. Ayame, you're from here? I really like you, Kodama. ﻿It's not your fault that ﻿I turned you down. ﻿But I felt bad, ﻿so I wanted to be honest with you. Really? ﻿Yes, really. ﻿The train ride and the picnic ﻿weren't tiring at all... and I thoroughly enjoyed our first date. ﻿That's the truth. ﻿I got it. ﻿But you know, my mother ﻿really likes your father. ﻿She wants to marry him! ﻿It's no use telling me that. Please understand that ﻿I just want her to be happy. Is your work going well? ﻿Well, if my current job goes well, all they'll need is a site. ﻿My friend's negotiating with a landowner... an old guy who runs in a Spanish soccer kit. ﻿My friend's running with him ﻿to persuade him. An old guy in a Spanish soccer kit? ﻿—So you like running. ﻿—I don't, to be honest. ﻿Okay then, you don't have to run anymore. What do you mean? Well... let's have some coffee. ﻿It's the lifeblood for tired men. ﻿—You like Chandler? ﻿—Yes, more or less. ﻿Then I'll sell my land to your company. ﻿Really? ﻿Hello, Komachi? We've got the land! Oh... really? ﻿That's great. ﻿You don't sound very impressed. ﻿You should be happy. ﻿Of course I'm happy. ﻿We should meet at ﻿the appropriate station... ﻿and have a drink to celebrate. ﻿The appropriate station? Yes, the appropriate station! ﻿Actually, Ayame, the girl ﻿who I considered marrying... ﻿turned out to be Hayatono's daughter. What? So did things go well with her? ﻿It's complicated. But bonds between people ﻿are truly important. Anyway, cheers! ﻿Cheers! ﻿Being dumped doesn't ﻿discourage you either, does it? ﻿But I can't figure out why ﻿we came here though. ﻿Don't you think it suits us? ﻿I looked it up in the timetable. ﻿I'll catch this train home.﻿ You'll catch the next one. ﻿But I'll have to wait for an hour. Why are you leaving me here? You won't be alone. Just trust me and do as I ask. Why are you here? ﻿I just wanted to see you. ﻿—You got a rail pass? ﻿—Does it matter? ﻿Anyway, I came to see you. ﻿Something's up, isn't it? ﻿Look, gentians. ﻿It was gerberas when we first met. That's right. ﻿Are we alone? Nobody's watching? We're alone, and nobody's watching. ﻿If you like me, kiss me. Ah, that sounds like a KiHa 125! ﻿Who cares? ﻿Ah... sorry. ﻿—This is serious! ﻿—It always is with you. ﻿But this is more serious than serious. ﻿Mr Chikugo wants us to ﻿coordinate his supplement factory! Really? We did it! It's serious indeed! Congratulations! ﻿So was there actually any point ﻿in me going? ﻿Of course there was! ﻿Glad to hear it. ﻿—Congratulations! ﻿—We made it! ﻿We did it! ﻿We got the loan! ﻿It's all thanks to Kenta! ﻿Really? ﻿Thank you! ﻿That’s great! ﻿It hurts... Thank you! ﻿We did it! ﻿Congratulations! We're just getting to know Komachi... ﻿but he will return ﻿to the head office today. ﻿It's a shame, but that's a salaryman's lot. ﻿Let's bid him a warm farewell. ﻿Everyone... thank you very much. ﻿Now it's time for ﻿our usual morning exercises. ﻿Good job! ﻿Well done! ﻿Thank you. ﻿Fancy sneaking out to Nakasu? ﻿I'll find you a hostess who's into trains. Thank you. ﻿Knowledge may be power, ﻿but hobbies are too. ﻿Thank you. ﻿May I embrace you, Komachi? ﻿Good job! I ﻿was only here briefly, ﻿but thank you for everything. ﻿—Komachi, morning! ﻿—Morning, Midori. ﻿You're back so soon. ﻿I bet you wanted to stay longer. ﻿That's the truth. You might be off again soon. You know something? ﻿Where? Where to? ﻿To take me out for a meal soon. ﻿Got it. - ﻿Excuse me! - ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Come in...! ﻿Sorry for the wait. ﻿You wanted to stay ﻿in Kyushu longer, didn't you? To be honest, yes. ﻿Our company is expanding. ﻿I want you to take a venture business approach... and you may travel the country. ﻿I like travelling, a little. A little? ﻿You sound like someone I know. —Cheers! ﻿—Cheers! ﻿You did great. You saved us. ﻿I'm glad we can all ﻿concentrate on our work now. ﻿They say love's a mystery, but... ﻿Ayame really came through for us. Dad... What's with that? ﻿Well... ﻿it seems that Ayame's mother ﻿is serious about you. Listen up. ﻿No matter how helpful ﻿they've been, I can't do it. Love and romance aren't transactions. ﻿I admire you, Dad. ﻿Actually, there's a Kamata hostess... ...﻿in her thirties called Mizuho. ﻿I've hit it off with her. Mizuho. Dad! How's Tokyo? ﻿It's not that bad to be back. ﻿Do you prefer neon lights ﻿or the sound of bugs chirping? ﻿No neon lights means fewer trains... ﻿so I guess I prefer neon lights. ﻿Do you want to marry me? ﻿I really like you, ﻿but I don't want to just yet. ﻿I want to do it now. ﻿I want to travel ﻿with my husband to Calgary... ﻿Helsinki... ﻿Stockholm... Vancouver... ﻿and lots of other places. ﻿These places are all chilly. ﻿An aborted kiss at a deserted station... ﻿I'll never forget that. ﻿I'm getting married. That's easy to say... Not with you. ﻿Let me introduce him. Nice to meet you. I'm Thunderbird Jr. ﻿I'm Komachi. Nice to meet you. Komachi, nice to meet you. ﻿I'm Thunderbird Jr. ﻿I've heard a lot about you. ﻿What have you heard? ﻿I've decided to marry him. ﻿He's a bobsledder. ﻿I'll see the world on tour with him. ﻿That'll suit me better than a railway view. I think I prefer planes to trains. ﻿I see. ﻿Congratulations, Thunderbird Jr. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Congratulations, Azusa. ﻿Thank you. Well, I will get going then. ﻿Thunderbird, huh? ﻿That's the Toyama-Osaka express. ﻿I wish I could run like a train ﻿through the streets of Tokyo. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿She dumped me. ﻿She's getting married. ﻿Really? ﻿Are we hopeless with women? ﻿I got turned down too. That's not it. ﻿There's a world that only we understand. ﻿You're right. ﻿He is right. ﻿That goes for me too. ﻿Why are you here? ﻿Did your trains stop working again? ﻿Crossing the Kanmon Straits made sense. I'﻿m negotiating with ﻿Nozomi Estate tomorrow. ﻿I see. ﻿Well, this is fun! ﻿I envy you two. ﻿When you become a boss, ﻿you lose your friends. See you. ﻿I want to go to Shikoku next time. ﻿I'd love to see the Inland Sea. ﻿It's Hokkaido for me. ﻿In the middle of a snowstorm. Is it okay for you to leave the work? ﻿It's okay. I'll take time off. ﻿—Let's make it a double date. ﻿—That'll never happen. ﻿But it'll be great if it does, right? ﻿Right? In Memory Of Yoshimitsu Morita (1950-2011).
