(theme music) (crackling fire) (night sounds) (Avram chuckling) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking) (motor revving) (dogs barking) - [Woman] It's really good you're here early. - [Hannah] What's up? - [Woman] Oh, she's fine. She just needs her walk. (dog panting) - [Hannah] All right. (guitar strumming) How's your week been Pen? - [Pen] Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Hannah] You get a chance to play it all this week? - A little bit. - Nice. You wanna try tuning the guitar by ear today? - [Pen] Sure. - Okay, let's see how we're doing. - [Pen] Okay. - It's been pretty humid, so it might be wonky. - [Pen] Yeah. - But I'm gonna play my low E string and then you play yours and try to get it to match the frequency of mine. Okay? - [Pen] Okay. (guitar strumming) - Oh, it's pretty close. All right. Now just careful, carefully listen and make sure it's really close. (gentle guitar music) (people chattering) Just got marshmallow on my cigarette. So, does anyone want a special cigarette? (children chattering) (men chattering) - [Man] What's up? (gentle music) - [Avram] Hey, you know, I read in The Globe that, they gave this one star, it was really bad. - [Hannah] Well, let's give it a shot, see what we get. Looks good. Yeah, make sure they don't rush you out, okay? Ask about side effects. - [Avram] Okay. - [Hannah] Do you have a notebook, or anything you can write stuff down? - [Avram] Oh yes I got this. - [Hannah] All right. All right. - [Avram] You don't have to be concerned. - [Hannah] Okay. You want me to come in with you? - [Avram] It's okay. Shouldn't take long. - [Hannah] Okay. I'll be here. (water trickling) - [Man On Radio] You know, like getting your allowance money and then like walking 20 minutes to the mall and like buying a record and if you hope to God, it's a fucking good record, 'cause you're not gonna get another one for three weeks. And like, you know, and then you go home and you put it on the turn. - Hey Hannah, look at these. - [Hannah] Oh wow. Oh, some good looking tomatoes. - They're incredible. (Hannah slurping) - Wow. The best fucking tomato I've had in my life. - Oh yeah. - [Man on radio] There's just, there's no gravity to it. There's no gravity to it. - Okay. - [Radio] It's just literally like, it's just, yeah. It's awesome experience, whatever. It's just, you know, it's just, yeah. And it doesn't drive. Doesn't drive the culture. Fucking Thompson Twins, fuck you man. - What time's Paul coming? - I think about seven. - [Man on radio] You know our Tears for Fears, like Jesus Christ. They're amazing. - Do you need any help with the cooking? - [Radio] They're amazing. - No, no, you sit down, I got it. I'm excited we get you for a couple of days. - [Paul] Yeah, it'll be nice to be home for a bit. - [Hannah] Yeah. - [Paul] It's been a while. - [Hannah] It has. Dad's very excited. - [Paul] You been keeping him busy? - Yeah, he's sitting the table now. - [Paul] Oh nice. - He knows the perfect, nice placement. - [Paul] The perfect angles for that. - Yeah. (laughing) - No, I shit you not. I heard uncle Jay's show on the way in. I'm amazed they still let him talk on the radio. - He makes us very proud. I mean, those call in's he gets are truly, truly special. - [Paul] They're insane. Dad, that's you that called in. - Oh no. - Come on, I could have swore I heard your voice on the radio. - It's not my thing. It make me nervous. People listen to that show. - Oh, don't sell yourself short dad. - And absolutely nobody listens to that show. (birds chirping) (chickens clucking) (people chattering) - Yeah, I mean, I just gotta onboard these Mumbai guys and then see what they say. We've been asking for updates for like a week, or two. Have you heard anything from them? No I mean, it makes sense where they're getting brought on, it's just a little frustrating, I thought we had a good handle on it, but just, I don't understand what the work of, the flow is gonna be now, that they're in the picture. I mean, it's like the time difference is like at least 11 hours I think, or something, but I'm, sorry, sorry, just gimme one sec, all right? Hannah, hey, I'm on the phone, all right? - What? - I'm on the phone. - [Hannah] Oh, okay, all right. Just (indistinct) - All right? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, Steve. So, what I was saying is that I think comms should be able to get something out in two weeks, regardless of what it is. I understand it's tricky, but that's why they're comms people. That's what they do. So, I know, I know, but listen, Mumbai's, Mumbai. (lawn motor revving) I understand why they're part of the team, but, it's just not gonna work for me. I think being in this position, I'm set to fail and Brian does this to me every. Hey. That was just an important call. - Well, it's okay. I didn't mean to interrupt you. - [Paul] What are you up to? - [Hannah] I am reading a book and taking it easy. - [Paul] Living the dream, huh? - [Hannah] Something like that. (Paul chuckling) - [Paul] Yeah. We've just been super busy at work. It's like, yeah, it's a crazy day. - Yeah. - A lot of meetings and things. All right. See ya. We just got brought on to help this company with their like green initiative. So, been pretty busy just getting that off the ground. - [Avram] That's great. - Yeah, you know it's cool. It's nice to be working just like wild west of environmentalism meets, market based solutions, but I'm just excited to be here right now. I didn't think it would happen that, as fast for me, but here we are. - I'm really proud of you. - Thanks. And I know the company's pretty cool and we've got like all these creative people, working on these projects with us that do the little digital mock ups and little animations for us that I don't know, I can't help but think that you would do really well at a place like this. - Yeah, that sounds interesting. - Yeah, I mean, I know you're not like super into marketing, but there's other departments that could fit. So, any plans for next week? 26, the big two six, come on. - Yeah. Pretty exciting. - I mean, it's a big one. You know why, right? - Year older, year wiser? (chuckling) - I mean that ends, that small administrative downside, getting the boot off your parents' health insurance. - I thought you were gonna say something fun Paul. - I mean, I wish I had better news kid, but sometimes there are things like this, that require a bit of a plan and maybe even little bit of forethought, have you even thought about this? - I'm just gonna get one of those government plans. They seem fine. - Government plan? Come on, fine. You know damn well, they're not okay. And I'm as liberal as they come, (Hannah laughing) but you and I both know, come on, the government should not be involved in those types of decisions. - Pray tell. - I think the bigger issue here Hannah is that, it's probably time for you to start looking for a real job. (Hannah sighing) - You know, I work every day, Paul. - Sure, but that's not a job. - I feel like that's a strange distinction to make. - I mean, there really isn't Hannah, you should probably just trust me on that, right? I can understand you're working these odd jobs here and there and you're here to help dad and that's great, but I can't help but think that it's time to get a job that's actually integrated into the economy. You know? (Hannah sighing) - No, I don't. - Dad, come on, you know what I'm talking about. (Avram sighing) - It's good to be thinking about the future. (night sounds) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - There you go. - Thanks. - Coffee's good. - Yeah, no, it is, thanks. You know, I do think it's a good idea Hannah. Most people, your age are making strides in their career. - I mean, I think that that's just you and your friends. There's, a lot of reasons I'm here. - I get it, you do a lot for dad and I'm just trying to be real with you. I think I got it, you don't need to help. - I can, if you can gimme anything. - No, no, I got it, I think. Fine. Grab that end. - [Avram] Yeah. - Ready, one, two. - [Avram] You know the center of gravity would be a little better if we took the monitor and moved it. - [Paul] We gonna put it sideways? - [Avram] Okay. - [Paul] Let's put it sideways. Go that way. Just watch (indistinct). A little more. Nice. Sorry. Here hold this. It's fine, just leave it. - [Avram] Okay, you sure? I can push it down. Just tell me how. - You can't just - You sure I can't help? - [Paul] Yeah. - Anything? - [Paul] No, it's fine. - [Avram] Hold something? - That's good. - Here. - [Avram] Okay. Your tires look a little low, if you wanna-? - They're fine. - [Avram] Did you say goodbye to Hannah? - [Hannah] She was busy when I knocked. Just tell her goodbye for me, all right? - Okay. Okay. - [Paul] Oh, thanks. All right. I'll call you. Bye dad. - [Avram] You take care. (motor revving) (car beeping) - [Paul] Jesus Christ. (car motor revving) (speaking in a foreign language) - What we got down there? How's it looking Igor? - It's not good. Everything is not good. - Yeah, it hasn't been driving so well. - I'm surprised it's driving at all. Bearing is cracked. It's extremely dangerous. Can break at any moment. Then, some wane break lines, air filter need replacement, oil change. (speaking in a foreign language) That kind of thing. - Fuck. All right, well what if we triage a little bit here? - Triage I dunno. (whirring traffic) - [Man] Yo Hannah. Sorry, it took me a second. - [Hannah] All good man. - [Man] Yeah. Were you waiting long? The fucking popcorn machine. It's like you gotta clean it, so it doesn't get all gunky. - [Hannah] Oh. - Excited to see you cut it up tonight. - Oh yeah. It's gonna be fun. - Yeah. - I wanted to ask you, man. How do you like working at the theater? - I don't. - Really? - No, it's okay. I like it a little bit, but it pays the bills. I mean, are you looking to get another job? - I might be. I'm not sure. - Yeah? I mean, I'd love to work with you here obviously. - [Hannah] So fun. - Be so much fun. I just don't think Tom is in the position to hire anybody anymore. - I thought you were the manager. - Manager, doesn't really mean shit. (Hannah laughing) - We're jamming. (guitar gently strumming) Oh, (indistinct) you sound great. (people chattering) - [Woman] I'm sorry. (gentle music) (people laughing) - [Man] Yo Han. - [Hannah] August man, what's up? - [August] Happy birthday. How you doing? - [Hannah] I'm good. - [August] Yeah? - [Hannah] Good to see you. - [August] You having a good time?. - I'm having a great time, man. - I talked to Tom at the theater again. - [Hannah] Oh yeah? Thanks for doing that. - No, go from him. - I sort of figured, yeah. - Yeah. Appreciate you doing that. - He's on some like end of day shit, walking around with his hand to his head, like, it's gonna be the last week for us. - [Hannah] Yikes. (August imitating gun blast) - Damn man, poor Tom. - Yeah, well it's a little dark, but I'm thinking maybe like try the mall or something. I saw some like help wanted posters and shit around there. - Yeah ,yeah I'll go check those out. Thank you. - Anyway, I'm gonna grab another beer. You want anything? - Sure. Yeah, beer would be good, thank you. - All right sis, I'll catch you in a second. (people chattering) (gentle music) (people chattering) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Hannah ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - [Man On Radio] All right, all right, that was a request for Bob Dylan. "Black Diamond Bay" Strange song. I always hear supposedly influenced by Joseph Conrad. Now let's take our own adventure into the heart of proverbial darkness, by taking this call from a certain special caller. Being trying to request a song all morning, she's been given a chance. All right caller, what's on your mind? You got a song request? - [Man] Yeah, I got request. - [Radio Announcer] All right, let's hear it. (yelling indistinctly) No can do buddy. All right. Bye bye to the caller. Better luck next time. Coming up, we've got "She's out all night with other men" by those local lads the Spindled Cucumbers. ♪ Race to the bottle ♪ ♪ Race to ♪ - [Hannah] Thanks. - So how's the niece? - Good, good. You know, same old. - How's Paul? - Paul's good. He's back in the area now and it makes dad happy. - Glad Auburn's hanging in there. - Yeah. I listen to your show this morning. - What'd you think? - [Hannah] You got a pretty nasty caller there. - That's Deacon George. - No. - Well, he's just blowing off steam. Everybody needs an outlet. He calls in every couple of days. - Oh my God. Fucking Deacon George. No way. - What's going on with you? - Well, I don't, you know, I'm thinking about maybe trying to consolidate to a real job, something a little more legit. Might give me benefits, health insurance, that kind of thing. I was wondering if maybe you had something available at the studio? - Hannah I gotta cut you off right there, man. I'd love to hire you, but the station have my balls in a goddamn vice, like ripe tomatoes fit to burst. - Jesus uncle Jay. - [Jay] They've been aching since '98. (laughing) - Damn. - I'm just kidding about that last part. But we had to fire the sweet kid that runs the sound gear. Now we all have to do it ourselves. We gotta run in, set the levels, hit record, run back out. Pray to God that it isn't peaking. If it wasn't for me, the radio would be dead. - Fuck I had no idea you guys were pulling that off on such a shoestring budget. - Shoestring budget, I could hang myself with that fucking string. (Hannah laughing) But then it'd just look like I'm doing what Deacon George asked me to do. - Yeah, we can't have that. (Hannah laughing) - Well anyway. So what do you need a real job for? (whirring traffic) (scanners beeping) - [Woman] So you're gonna need to go onto the website. - [Hannah] Okay. - [Woman] (indistinct) mainly. - [Hannah] Okay sure, great thank you. Appreciate it. (soft music) Y'all have any like job applications? - [Man] No, unfortunately we're not hiring right now. - [Hannah] Okay. (wind swooshing) (traffic whirring) (chickens clucking) - [Man] So how's your old man doing? - He's okay. He's hanging in there. - He's a tough old bird. - Yeah, not really, but that's okay. The doctor has him on this new clinical trial. Hopefully he'll start to see the results from that soon. - I told him once I told him a thousand times, he doesn't drink enough. You gotta make your body an unfit place for germs to live. (Hannah laughing) Never listened. - Maybe we should get you in there. - I'm already there. (Hannah laughing) - I wanted to mention to you that I'm looking for some work and I might not be able to take as many shifts in the farm. There's no real timeline about it and you know, I love it here. So, I'm gonna try to figure out a way to make it all work but just wanted to give you a heads up, not leave you high and dry. - Work. There's plenty of work to do here. - [Hannah] I just I... - [Man] What kind of job you looking for? - I don't know. Something that's a little more, I don't know, a little more legit. - Legit? (Hannah sighing) - Well, I've been applying to tons of stuff, but no one's really getting back to me. So, at this point, looking more, you know, retail, fast food. I... (dog barking) Uncle Jay, man, you gotta stop playing that fucking small dick music on your radio show. - [Jay] Like what? - [Hannah] I cannot listen to another fucking Jeffrey Toll. Fuck me. (Hannah laughing) A Steely Dan marathon. - [Avram] Yeah but he's not as good as Benny Goodman. - [Jay] Dude. - [Hannah] Right, Benny Goodman, he doesn't have to compensate for anything. - [Jay] Steely Dan is secure in my dick size music. (Hannah laughing) Cinderella is small dick music, or any 80s hair band. - [Hannah] I don't disagree with ya, but you know, what do you think dad? - [Avram] I don't know, but you know, Glen Miller, I think he actually perished not during flight, but in a house of ill refute in France. - [Hannah] Really? - [Avram] Yeah. (gentle music) - [Jay] So how are you doing? - Ah all right. How about you? - I'm fine. (Hannah laughing) What's with these goats, huh? - You know, goats, they're really good climbers. - Is that so? - Look at their hooves. - [Jay] Do you remember when dad took us here? - [Avram] I do. - [Caitie] I just don't understand why you couldn't have just asked your family to ask. - [Paul] It's a two block walk. - [Caitie] No, okay but I picked out. - [Paul] Two blocks. - [Caitie] I picked out my outfit thinking that we were gonna be sitting in air conditioning. - [Paul] We're gonna be in air conditioning in now a block and a half. - [Caitie] Why can't you just ask people for help when it's appropriate? - I'm not gonna call my daddy for a ride, a block and a half. - That has nothing to do. What? You think that that's immature? - [Paul] I'm 31 years old, okay? - [Caitie] It doesn't matter. - Dad, we gotta take you to one of these wine and paint nights in the city now that we're here. - Oh my God, yes. Oh, they are seriously, so much fun and they're so up your guys' alley. You would love it. - Yeah, it's perfect for you guys. - What is paint night? - It's wine and paint night. You gotta have both. You go to the studio, or cool new restaurant with a bunch of your buddies and they have this maestro, really teach you stroke by stroke how to paint a real painting. You feel so creative. - Hannah, you know what we're talking about, right? - Oh yeah, sure. - Last week we did one where we painted the Fenway Parks and I actually think they came out incredibly professional. - Looks like an actual real painting. - Well, it sounds interesting. - Oh yeah, interesting. It's transformative. We should get something like this. - [Caitie] Yeah I would love. - [Paul] Registry plates were nice but, You can't really put, dad you can't really put. So Hannah, how's the job search going? - Good. - Yeah? You apply to any cool places? - Yep. - Good going. What type of places? - Fast food chains, retail associate. You know? - That's great. That's a great place to start. - Yeah, absolutely. Seriously, there's no shame in that whatsoever. - Well. - We was listening to this awesome podcast about this CEO who was talking about, you know, cleaning the fryer two in the morning after these like brutal days and getting paid next to nothing for it, but how much that sort of informed his character as a businessman. - Yeah. - So inspiring. There are so many stories like that, you know, it's like, not just this one guy. I was literally just listening to another one and it's like a female CEO. - Wow. - So it's that much more relevant, 'cause F men, you know? - We had a good run. - So have you heard back from anywhere yet? - No, not yet. - Okay so that's... - Oh actually, oh my God, I was at this conference last week and I connected with this guy from a startup in town and he is doing this really interesting thing. He's sort of looking for, unconventional people. He was hiring off of, what was it? Innovative potential. - Oh, it's my middle name. - Right? Because, okay so, they're intentionally switching everything up. So, they got English majors doing coding and coders doing the copy, I'm gonna connect you guys. - [Paul] 100%. That's amazing. - You don't to do that. - No, no, I think she should, that's great. - [Avram] Iron plates and hung 'em up and then sell them. - So, you like following up in these places, or what's going on? - Yep, all the good stuff Paul. - What does that mean, like phone call, email? - [Avram] Tell me, did you hear this one before? - You know artisanal gift baskets, wine and cheese spreads, the works. - Got it, so I think you got this handled on it. - [Caitie] Oh, that's a pretty good one I think. - [Avram] Got it? - [Caitie] Yeah, like a raise. - [Avram] Oh, she's good. (train horn blaring) - [Announcer] Train approaching. Please remain behind. (people chattering) - [Hannah] Paul, I have no idea what to say. - [Paul] Don't worry. - [Hannah] These people who care about apps care about- - [Paul] He doesn't really care about that stuff. You know, it's just a coffee. Go there. Be creative. Talk to the guy. See what he's about and he'll find a place for you on his team. - Well, yeah, I mean, I can't say I'm a total expert on urban planning or the layout in London. - Estimate. Do your best. - Okay. Yeah, if we're talking about London proper here, probably it's about 200 streets, right? And each street has one hydrant, but if you include the greater areas, I mean, you might be dealing with like up to 2000 street, I mean, it's hard to say. Again, I don't know the area. And then I think, and both sides of the streets need hydrants, right? So, it would probably be more like two per street, which, and how many street? 2000. Okay. Yeah, I guess 4,000. 4000 would be my best bet, but you know, it's hard to say. - Okay. Hannah, do you offhand know your Myers Briggs type? - Oh yeah. - [Guy] INFP, or EFJ? - I'm sorry. I don't actually know what you're talking about. I thought I mixed it up with something else. Not sure. - [Guy] Right. Well, it was so lovely to meet you. (phone vibrating) (people chattering) (phone vibrating) (train whirring) (nature sounds) (dog panting) (people speaking in a foreign language) (motor spluttering) - You hear? Don't surprise, it's strange sound to (indistinct). - So it's good? - It's not good, but it work, for now. - Okay. - Take care of your car. - Yeah. - And I advise you come back some for make the break don't risk. - Okay, I can do that. - Although, I did oil change and inspection for you. - Oh, well how much more is that gonna cost? - Nothing. - Thanks. ♪ Here today ♪ ♪ Funny how it ♪ - [Avram] Can you turn the music off? - [Hannah] Yeah. Is that better? - [Avram] Yeah. (water trickling) (gentle music) (Hannah sighing) (phone ringing) - Hello? This is she.

Yeah, we got the best food here. - Yeah, I've had it before. It's really great. - No way. Oh my God. It's like gourmet fast food, you know what I mean? - Totally. Yeah, that's a perfect way to put it. - [Man] Yeah, that's great. Okay, so what's your availability like? - Well, I'm pretty flexible. - Pretty flexible. Okay. Flexible is good. And what about during the weekends? - Sure. Yeah, I mean occasional weekends. Okay. - Would be fine. - Awesome. And what about nights? - Yeah, I can do some nights. - Awesome. Okay, we need a night person, so that's fantastic. - [Hannah] Oh, okay. - Okay, great. - [Hannah] Yeah. - Great, all right, well drum roll. You're hired. (Hannah chuckling) - That was quick. - Yeah, absolutely. So we'll have you on a 30 day probationary period, at which point we can let you go if there's not a right fit, things like that. And then you're on contract for a full year and then you can become a full-time store associate. - Okay, sure. - Pretty great, right? - [Hannah] Yeah. - Do you have any questions for me? - Do you guys have any, do you have any benefits, like health insurance? - Yeah, so we just actually renewed our contract with Aspen Crest Medical. It's a great healthcare plan with a modest deductible. - Okay. Modest? - Well, look, technically management doesn't have an obligation to cover its employees for medical care, but they do and that's pretty cool. - Yeah. (traffic whirring) (music playing on radio) (radio static) - [Radio Host] Good God. - [Man] Aw, come on man. What's wrong with Van Halen? - [Man On Radio] They suck dude. No Van Halen and no Bon Jovi too. - [Man On Radio] His full name is John Francis Bon Jovi Jr. - All right dad.

They're the gifts that keep on giving. (Hannah sighing) How was your day? - It was all right. I didn't do much. How about you? - It was pretty good. You know, sold some burgers, sold some fries. I think pretty soon I'll be running the whole place. (Hannah sighing) Well, dad, I think it's time for you to go to bed. It's awfully late. - [Avram] Yeah. - [Hannah] We got a big day of Twilight Zone marathons tomorrow. - [Avram] Oh yeah. (Hannah chuckling) - [Man] Nope, that's it. Thank you. - Look at those awesome hands. Just drop 'em in and just let 'em sit there. Those will take four minutes.

We got a little bonfire going on in the woods, or something. Give a buzz if you're getting out at any time early. - Fuck. I hope I can make it. It sounds fun. - [Robbie] Awesome, I'd love to see you boss. (people chattering) - [Man] Yeah you know. Just a second. Hey Sullivan, make sure that they're medium rare. - [Man On TV] Like over there and sit down and breathe through your nose and let me read my magazine. - [Man] When the bus comes, there'll be a loud sound of an engine. Door open. People will come in here, then you'll know the bus is here. (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Avram] What the hell? - [Man] Hey asshole. Yeah you, what the fuck are you doing? You can't just walk onto a fucking golf course. - All right. - [Man] Get the fuck off. Are you a member? You don't look like a member. Get the fuck off private property. That's what this is, private fucking property. (Avram panting) - Greg. - [Greg] Yes? - Can you hand me a spoon? Did you see Nicky came in earlier? Yeah. So fucking hot. (food sizzling) Yeah. I fucked her. - Beautiful. - Yeah, nah but you know, I could have, like, I saw her at trivia night over by McMorgan's and she gave me the look, you know? Dude, you just know. - [Hannah] Hey, what's up Greg? - [Greg] Yo. - How long you been working here man? - [Greg] A few years now. - [Hannah] Wow, damn. - Yeah, it sucks. But I'm signing up for night school. - [Hannah] Oh cool. What are you studying? - I think programming. - [Hannah] Oh that shit's hard. - Yeah, it's where the money is. I'm actually pretty good at like, math and numbers and coding and logic shit. - I totally fucking failed all those classes in high school. - Yeah, no, yeah me too. You know? But that doesn't mean anything, you know? It's the teachers, they weren't really teaching it the right way. I mean, do you go to college? - No, I was really only like good at English and just didn't feel like it made sense to go into debt for like a fucking lit degree. You know what I mean? It's not really practical. - Yeah. - [Avram] Oh, Hannah. - [Hannah] Hey dad. - [Avram] Glad to see you. Twilight Zone marathon in five minutes. - Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't think I got it in me tonight. - Oh, that's okay. But I'm glad to see you and I could use some help. - What's going on? Oh, sure. There you go. Just take it out of that. - [Avram] Thanks. - [Hannah] Yeah. You know what dad, that looks pretty good. Why don't you make me one and I'll go shower and then come down and meet you for an episode, or two. - That'd be nice. - [Man] Well, shall we run through it again, miss? - [Woman] Oh no, thank you. I was just noticing it, it isn't very much, but that bag. - [Man] What about it? - [Woman] Well, it's just like it. (birds chirping) - Yo Han. They had a pretty good time the other night, everybody hanging out before, Connor and Hunter got all kinds of fucking rocked and one of them fell and slid on the ground. Cut up their hands like stigmata. (Hannah laughing) - Hell, now I'm really sad I missed that. - Yeah. They got through a pretty heated one, fighting each other yeah. Christina was asking about you too a little bit. - Yeah, I probably should have taken a night off and gone and met up with her before she goes back. But, what's the fucking point, you know? - Sure, I mean, I don't know. People have a way of coming back together surely. - Yeah. - [Man] I wouldn't worry about it. - Yeah, no. I mean, it's nice to see you now. - Always good seeing you sis. (sizzling grill) - So, how have you been? - I'm pretty good, you know? Can't complain. How about you? - Well, I wanted... - You were saying. Have you been watching any good TV lately? We've been watching "Edge of Oblivion". You seen that? - No, never heard of it. - No? Good show it's on HBO. It's pretty good. It's like, you know, dark and tries to be smart and- - HBO? - Yeah. You've got HBO. - Oh. All right. I'll have to check it out. - Yeah. We've been binging out like crazy lately. - Oh that's well, the dark show that I watch, is Twilight zone. - [Paul] Still? - I've only binge ginger snaps, but I don't know that you can binge TV. It's not edible. - Yeah, it's like a metaphor though. Like, you're not, I'm not eating the TV. I'm just watching it a lot of it at once. But I don't know, it's good. - Greg, a customer needs you over there. - [Man] Hey what's the hold up? - [Hannah] Okay. - [Ma] Oh my God. - [Paul] You seen the Regal? - No. Interesting. Interesting. - Yeah, they put the modern spin on it. So, it's a little more contemporary, less Cold War, more iPhones, stuff like that. - Yeah, but history repeats itself. - That's not true. There's never been an iPhone before. But, I don't know, you might like it. It's funny. But I mean, yeah, I don't know, Caitie and I like it. Sorry one sec. - Oh, I know. It's a business. - What time does Hannah get home? - I don't actually know. I think it's gonna be a while though. - Good, all right. (gentle music) - [Woman] All right, keep it up. - [Man] Okay, thanks. - [Man 2] Okay. (traffic whirring) (men chattering) - [Man] Oh yeah. I just think Burlington could do better. I don't know. Come and see officer at the back. (people chattering) It is. Everything sucks. (people chattering) (gentle music) (Hannah sighing) - [Hannah] What? - Hey, morning. - Hey Paul. How's it going? - What's going on? I made us breakfast. Hope you're hungry. - Yeah, thank you. - How you feeling? - I'm tired. - Yeah. There's coffee, let me get you some. - [Hannah] Thanks. - You know, I took a half day today and I'm off work. So, if you're interested, you wanna go for like a bike ride, or something? Get outside. Stretch the legs. - Yeah, that sounds nice. - [Paul] Yeah? - Thanks. - Come on, dig in, what do you want? Sausages? - Sure, yeah. - You got orange juice too? - Yeah. - [Paul] There you go. - [Hannah] I like your outfit, man. Really lets it all hang out. - [Paul] You know? Makes a little more sense when you're on like a carbon bike but, (Hannah laughing) dad's old beat up old piece of crap like (indistinct). - [Hannah] Where do you wanna go? - [Paul] Maybe the reservoir. You got it in you? - [Hannah] Yeah, that sounds good. - [Paul] Cool, let's do it. - [Hannah] Are you gonna pop a wheelie for me now? Oh oh. - [Paul] Nope. - [Hannah] Yeah. (Hannah and Paul laughing) What was that one called? Wow, yeah there we go. - [Paul] It's a great way to like pull a hamstring. - [Hannah] Yeah. (Hannah laughing) (birds squawking) - [Paul] So you getting along with this manager, at the job of yours? - Yeah, I mean, he's a deadbeat, but we get along just fine. - Cars he drives? Does he have kids, a house? What's his deal? - No idea. - I always look at the cars that the guys I'm working for have, tells you about your own future there. But, does he like his job? - I mean, he doesn't do much. So, it's sweet for him. - Do you like your job? - I'm thinking about quitting. (Paul sighing) - I mean, you have to prioritize your mental health, of course. So that's like first and foremost. So, if you're not happy there, I get it. But no one's happy at a job. - Well, I really love the farm so... - And like, I'm sure the farm will be happy to have you. You're a good worker, but you can't just go back to this ignorance is bliss, kumbaya, let me pick a cucumber once a day type job. That might be fun now. Talk to the old hippies that have been there for 70 years. Their back hurts. They got no savings. (Hannah sighing) Their kids pay their dental bills. You know what, actually, I love that. Fuck that job. Let's get you outta there as soon as we can, right? And I think this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna talk to Caitie. She'll talk to Simon. I heard the first interview didn't go so well. So, maybe we just like prep together and I can run some questions by you and so you can sort of practice a bit. We'll set up something. I know she's got a meeting there this week and she could literally walk you into this thing. Tee it up for you. It's literally a no lose situation. Okay? Wednesday, I think at noon. - Yeah, fine. - Okay. All right. Amazing, amazing, Wednesday. Cool, see it wasn't wasn't that bad right? Come on. (Paul chuckling) It doesn't have to be like a fight every time we talk about work, it can be good. (Paul sighing) You know, there's other stuff in life that I would love to talk to you about. Our new place. We've got a second bedroom that like, we would love to have you and you can visit whenever and if this new job doesn't pay great, just scratch with us. It'd be fucking better than staying with dad. You can live a life a little bit. I don't know, would you want to come into the city? Would you wanna spend time with me and Caitie? We would love to meet, any partner you might have. I feel like, I'm the one always trying to talk to you and you're family. (whirring traffic) (people chattering) (train honking) (train rattling) (train rattling) - [Hannah] Hey dad. - Hey. How you doing? - I'm okay. How are you doing dad? - I'm not great. (Hannah sighing) - Well let me see, what can we do for you here? You wanna go get some ice cream, or something? - Yeah, that'd be great. (whirring traffic) (night sounds) Oh, fuck my fucking life. (Russian anthem music) - [Ice Cream Shop owner] To all our loyal patrons after 90 years of dedicated service, we regretfully must close our doors to the many family and friends, who have joined us over the decades, on our fragrant green pastures. As we shutter these windows stands, our hearts are heavy and our cones empty. This Creamery has been in the Bayarsky family for generations. It has been our honor to provide the community with endless hours of good times and sweet creams. While our humble parlor must close, we believe that cream is universal and eternal and that the milk enacts us of freedom, continue to flow forth, as long as there is solidarity and affection among all those who will seek, enjoying them. With love Dimitry and Joanna Bayarsky. - What a loss. - [Narrator] All righty folks, that was Vandyke Parks with White Chrysanthemums. Coming up, take a deep dive into the edge of tonight's the night. This is seriously one of the best fucking albums of all time. (night sounds) What? Well, what can be done anyway? Anyhow, it looks like we've got a caller, seven, eight, four, here you go. You're on the air. What's on your mind pal? - [Man] Hey, can you hear me? - [Announcer] Loud and clear. Actually you're coming in a little hot. You mind moving the phone back a bit? - [Man] Sorry about that. - [Announcer] Perfect my friend. What's on your mind? - [Man] I just got a quick question for you. - [Announcer] Can't wait to hear it, buddy. What do you wanna know? - [Avram] You know, uncle Jay ran for mayor. - [Hannah] No way, I didn't know that. - 1978. - [Hannah] Wow. (Hannah laughing) They can't have gone well for him. - Yeah, he ran as a Leninist. Got 2% of the vote and a whole lot of people were arrested for public nuisance. (Hannah laughing) - Stand corrected then, that did go pretty well. - [Avram] You know. - [Announcer] Prioritize what you emphasize. - I sort of feel bad about uncle Jay. - [Announcer] You care about the heart choices man. The thing is call yourself anything you like. - I always felt I could have done more. - [Announcer] To a large degree, emphasize what you do. - [Hannah] Like what? - [Announcer] You care about choices man. - I don't know. - [Announcer] The thing is you can call yourself anything. - I was a lot older. - [Announcer] All right, Tom. - I wasn't around when he was a kid. I wasn't there to guide him. - [Man] Got so little time in life, you know? You can only do so much. - I don't think you have to worry about that dad. - [Announcer] What you prioritize, what you.... - Think uncle Jay's just fine. - [Announcer] And what you say, what you care about. The hard choices. - Yeah. - [Announcer] And the thing is you call yourself anything you like, but what you choose to emphasize is to a large degree who you are. You know what I mean? - [Man] Sure, yeah. - [Announcer] Well folks, it's 11:30 p.m on this beautiful Tuesday. Hope you're all having a lovely summer night and we've got some local music coming up to take us out. (gentle banjo playing) Don't forget folks. Everything comes back. Including this show. I'll see you all soon. (gentle music) (flames crackling) (night sounds)
