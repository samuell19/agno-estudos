Will you take me to Pattom? - Ah okay - Lets go What else? Buses are on strike today also, eh? - Yes - Strike - Will you come? - Sure - Where to brother? - Pattom - How's business? - As usual 'News headlines' 'Around 10:30 this morning, a ball of fire accompanied with a fearful sound...' '...was reported to have been seen in several places' The explosion in the sky at Palakkad have triggered panic among people It was so loud It was a deafening sound I have never heard so loud a noise in my whole life We saw it, we actually did But no one believes us The explosion and ball of fire has created panic among people This is definitely Kaliyugam (age of downfall) The world is on its way to its end This is no earthquake It is some phenomenon A very scary phenomenon No one understood what it was They just ran out shouting in fear People were terrified We first though it was an earth quake Then we realized it was in the sky We are ourselves destroying nature We must therefore bear the consequences So let us face it People must not panic Everything can be brought under control The govt has given orders for tight security People who have suffered losses shall be compensated suitably by govt The nodal officers have already been given instructions The govt expects co operation and a combined effort... ...from all public works departments We expect all of you to co operate You must behave decently Not like a drunkard Don't worry It is with regard to your kids - Everything will become alright - There's no use talking about it Your oldest son Pratapan Take him for instance You educated and brought him up well What more can you do? - You just don't worry yourself - There is no use This is the 'age of downfall' dude Let us sit here for 5 minutes We'll try to reduce your anxiety a bit I keep telling you not to worry These are not very important Think of good things Why must you worry? Goodness! Hey! Look at that Yes Yes sir What?! What is the radar report? Could not track any signal sir Inform the SUD And get a report now Sir there were 3 lights Massive very bright and not so bright Just hovering around the earth Get me the infra red report Its not an aircraft or any sort of defence mechanism used by a country What the hell is it? We have got another report Four minutes after the first sightings Its towards north east - How far? - 282 km in 40 seconds What?! Sir Yes sir! Sir Minister for defense is on line Sir Yes sir Okay What are we supposed to do sir Minister says everything is under control But this is not under control They don't know what they are dealing with I can tell that she is scared Those lights Bright lights She said... ...she couldn't take her eyes off it Things were not the same since last 2 days My dear Don't worry It's nothing I tell you, it's nothing It's okay What did she see? I have no idea What should I believe? That also I don't know I have to consult an expert I can't bear to see her suffer like this Would you think the same like others do? No But I feel she needs your support and strength Until she becomes normal both of you must go somewhere else I will shift to my sister's house for a few days Did she say anything else about that night? I mean if she felt a presence Or seen someone Anything else that she saw out there? No Why do you ask? Nothing 'We are all living in a world of imagination' 'A world we created for ourselves' 'Where the very laws of nature...' '...are different, hypothetical and self contained' 'When our imagination clash with reality...' '...we come across things and thoughts we can't fathom' 'Something that you cannot accept' 'That's when we must decide...' '....whether to believe in it or not' Sir, is this strange phenomenon connected to the red rains of 2001? I am unable to give you more info on this, I am sorry But the govt is very serious about this And we have formed a special investigation team We are examining similar events that have occurred earlier You know people are already confused You must not mislead them with false information Are these investigations generally done under secrecy? Is that why you are not sharing it with media? We don't have any proper evidence which we are looking for There are many witnesses to such events Do you think it's not relevant? Fake photos and videos can be created even by a kid... ...with the help of a good software They could not provide any proof to stand up and prove... ...the existence of this extraordinary Phenomenon Sir...one more question How are you, brother? Very funny! - Got you, eh? - Yeah! Come - Here - Thank you Come on tell me, what's up with you? Have you finished your course? Do you have to go back to the UK? I must go back in any case I have to submit my final dissertation And I have with some friends planning to start a production house I must apply for the VISA It takes time Unbelievable! It's been 5 years, right? Time flies Actually things are just shaping up It's come quite advanced, but the cold Well isn't that the best part? Look how warm it is here Bro, we can tolerate the heat But the cold numbs your limbs... ...and I don't know how to express it - But summer is heaven - Yeah, I know That's why I come to India during winters And enjoy the British summer every year Any news about my younger brother? Weren't you there?

Life is a puzzle It's hard to unlock even though the answers are around you These are the last words he told me You know...I miss him too I am hoping he comes back But we can only hope isn't it? Forget that Go and freshen up By the way, people here are all in panic What happened? I'll tell you Where are all your friends? Lost their way, eh? They? Lose their way? In such a small town? What's the name of the- Mathrabhoomi office The Mathrabhoomi office?

Oh he never puts down the camera Sorry for him He is kind of crazy guy Artistic Yeah artistic better That's it! So we told him to come to India Shoot some footage Documentary - Come in - Oh sorry yeah So what plans tonight? I thought I'd cook and we could have some drinks Yeah cool And we have cheddar cheese - Perfect - You like it? Yeah Yeah Come lets go Surya News 'In Siberia of Russia several people got hurt...' '...in an earthquake that destroyed a number of buildings' 'People wonder if it was related to the event that occurred in Kerala' I've been performing this research for a long time What I have understood is that there is a lot of unnatural phenomena But people here don't notice them I don't know how to explain it to them either Recently a small girl fell prey to an incident A victim of a close encounter Close encounter? What's that? If a person encounters a being from a different planet-life or meets a UFO... ...Unidentified Flying Object we call it a close encounter Yeah UFO right? Yeah you're a fool I like it I'll explain it to you Are you saying the child might have seen something like this? May be I am not sure I have no proof You know Serjo people started to experience strange phenomenon from the sixties Maybe also before I don't know But have you never heard about alien abductions? Nope Hybridizations? I don't want to know anything about that Alien abductions became popular by the Betty and Barney Hill abductions And that too in 1961 Yeah, everybody knows about this I've never heard that I haven't about it at all The first American couple who claimed they saw aliens Later similar such incidents were reported in other parts of the world Roswell incident You never heard about this? Roswell incident? Oh come on man What are you talking about? I think everybody knows the truth I don't know Andreah I don't know man Could be but sounds strange Extraterrestrials have visited earth many years ago Few times...they don't show us But you know it's true Oh stop it! Brother, these aliens what are they like to look at? Have you seen one before? I don't know I've never seen one before But recent incidents and witnesses descriptions have led us to believe that... ...they are quite different from us I don't understand For example, their eyes could be oval in shape Or they could be small eyes Or have different colors or shapes Or maybe they just look like us Who knows how do they look like? Brother, why haven't you proved any of this? - Why did you stop teaching? - Stopped teaching? Did you know? In Kerala University when I was teaching astronomy classes, I was very enthusiastic I felt a lot of excitement teaching kids Working in the observatory When researching alien life forms I used to be amazed How did the people of ancient times gain so much knowledge... ...of planets and the solar system You quit when your brother went missing, right? I do not know what happened to my brother My own life had no answers How do I find answers for someone else? My brother was everything He was my every joy and now my sorrow Later, I wasn't able to even teach I lost interest in everything Even to find him It changed my life completely You know life has to move on What is that? I don't know What's happening? But I don't think this is the right time to find out Come let's go in Come on 'The mystery of bright lights that have been...' '...have not yet been solved' 'Witnesses claim that they are multicolored...' '...and appear in different places at different times' 'In some places they appear to move also' Hello? What? Where? When? Okay! I'm coming right away Has anyone seen anything? No, people of the house are terrified having heard sounds, middle of the night What do you think? There are marks as if a sharp instrument was surgically used... ...but not a drop of blood shed The entire portion of mouth and internal organs entirely removed I don't understand this There was a similar incident reported in Colorado in 1967 A small pony 3 years old Only its skin remained Nothing could be found out Later in the US European countries and Indonesia And now here Yes We need more proofs I mean more information What more do you want on this? Have you reported this to the police? This is happening all over The news channels have been reporting it big way Do we have to report it specifically to them now? Police or channels, what's the use The govt will easily cover it up I am unable to let it go People must know why this is happening I will come with you No! I need a person to report to me You stay back here Where did you go so early this morning? 'Cattle are dying in large numbers' 'The govt has entrusted a special agency to investigate into this event' 'Officials inform that people must not panic in such incidents' 'The govt will suitably compensate for the loss of cattle' 'Further incidents may be reported to our nearest office says the govt' 'The agriculture minister will visit the places...' '...of such unfortunate incidents and give a report directly' 'Our special correspondent reports from the site of incident' 'What sort of noises did you hear when cattle were being killed?' 'It was pitch dark' 'A vague form about 6-7 feet high We could not make out what it was' 'Not just in our locality, but over there also People have heard similar sounds' 'But no one could figure out' What is going on here? I'll explain It was in 1967 that cattle mutilation was first reported What is it? It's a strange phenomenon Unbelievable incidents Animals are deprived of their internal organs... ...their blood sucked out but without a single wound Internal organs are lost and there is no obvious point of entry You mean removed just like that? No...I mean yes There are wound marks like surgery was done but with no trace of blood And they don't leave any evidence No tracks or marks leading to it I am unable o believe this I don't believe it I know it's hard It's not that it's hard to believe Just things to fool people It's a hoax guys No, no it's possible It is possible Believe me it is! But I don't understand why they do it I don't know May be it's a signal for a message or experiment An experiment? Yeah, like for hybridization or something else What are you saying bro? Hybridization... in this 21st century? Wait! I'll explain What is there to explain? That aliens from mars and Saturn are coming here? Or that we are going there? Or maybe the earth is coming to an end? Explain what? The truth No one here may believe what I am about to explain See...Mexico, Montano Alamosa, Colorado More than 15 states since 1967 have reported such events Nearly 130 mutilations is said to have occurred during the 70s Since 2001, more than 200 incidents and it's a fact, it's real it has happened But what or who did it I am not sure But hypotheses suggest visitors from other planets That means, beings from other planets Aliens who may have come to collect genetic materials Anyways their purpose is unknown But their proximity to earth has always been there From when is that? Since ancient Egypt Haven't you seen pictures of beings with a human body and animal heads? They say these were also created by God Are you joking? That is just a part of their beliefs and rituals They are baseless There is no evidence Evidences? How many do you want? Take the pyramids of Egypt Researchers have found bones of humans and animals... ...excavated from a single skeleton The kings of those times disposed them in such a way that they'd never return They buried these creatures so that they will never ever rise again You mean like cloning? Likely See, we are in the right stage of re-creating animals and even humans But were they...? So why doesn't people know about this? Because truth doesn't sound good all the time Especially in a country like India With multiple culture, religion and language - It's hard to pin down - No one would accept that That's not true Neil Because there are a lot of people in the world... ...who believe aliens have visited the earth before Check this Maybe they are still here But why...? Why would you want to waste your time searching all these strange mysteries? You don't have to go anywhere It's all around you You just have to open your eyes and see the big picture Sorry man! I think I know where to find my answers Yes Wow! - What is it? - Banana chips So good man Wanna try? I don't know why we don't have this in Italy It tastes so good - Banana? - Yes banana We are finally going to the jungle, right? Yeah! Finally Jungle I don't think this is the best time to go Come on every time You are so pessimistic man I am not pessimistic These days something is wrong here I don't know what but I have a feeling You are crazy man You are crazy too You guys okay at the back? Yeah Where are we going now? I have to meet a person urgently A person who has clear thoughts about this 'The cabinet of ministers have decided to suitably...' '...compensate farmers for the loss of their cattle' 'A special team was designated to investigate...' '...and report from places of such incidents' 'The special team has collected detailed evidences such events' 'They beg people not to panic but be calm' 'They say these issues are under control...' '...and the govt has ensured the safety of people' 'But some factions within govt claim that some anti social elements are doing this' 'And yet some others say it is a tactic to distract people' '...from actual issues at hand' 'Witnesses claim that extremely bright lights...' '...were seen on the sky at times in many places' 'As a precaution people are advised to stay indoors' Capital M little m here Capital F is equal to little m N is equal to capital M A constant Newton at that age did not know that its value was divided by r square R is the distance between 2... Professor, do you still teach? Isn't that why still exist? Imparting knowledge It's been a long time since we last met You left without a trace How will I find you in this wide world? I did leave without telling anything to anyone You do know the state I was in Did you get any information about your brother? No But I want to get some information Some unknown phenomena Certain things which I have no clue about I want to know if I am going in the right direction Regarding? History, science It's all about science Great historians and scientists have left great messages Sir Isaac Newton, Aryabhatta Such great minds have spent their entire life... ...trying to find the truth about human evolution Sir, sorry to interrupt But I really need to know Are they coming with you? Yes sir So they need to know what they are involved in Involved? What do you mean by involved? Take your seat Life on earth Life on other planets Our solar system Stars, galaxies, constellations Our scientists have spent their entire lives... ...to gather knowledge for future generations While we just have a gala time Enjoying worldly pleasures Not committed to anyone No commitments Who does not know of such things today? Solar system galaxies etc Really? So who can tell me about our solar system? Tell us about the planets You are all educated and well informed I know As time passes we forget most of it Which is the largest planet in the solar system? - Jupiter - Good Which is the planet nearest the sun? - Mercury - Very Good Our earth which is the 3rd planet from the sun and 5th largest... ...out of the 8 planets of solar system A home to millions of species lies in its habitable zone Keeping just the right distance from our sun Any closer to the sun the waters would boil away And farther away it will freeze Ideal conditions for life to have evolved That's true The only world where life exists No aliens or extra terrestrials We are the only living beings on this earth Says who? Just like we exist here there may be other planets where life may exist Maybe million of light years away But life is possible only on planet earth No, there are millions other planets And millions other constellations Galaxies Different colors shapes sizes Thousands even millions Earth like planets have been found Many of them out there Scientists prove that life could exist just like ours May be even advanced than ours Many times over the past years The Germans, Americans, Russians May be most of the advanced countries have tried to make contact Sir, is this in some way related to the red rain Is it all connected? I cannot tell you I can only give you directions I cannot give an answer But I am sure You will reach whatever you are looking for...I am very sure But I am not sure I am not clear about many things I really need your help It really doesn't depend on me Look this job is too tough for an old man like me But which job?

Don't touch - What's that? - I don't know May be an insect bite I've never seen something like this There are some unknown bacteria in this place What kind of bacteria? I've read an article written by grandpa It's relating to some kind of unknown bacteria In 2001 there was news of a strange happening A big ball of fire fell to earth and created panic among people It was there in the media Remember? No What was it? Some people said something came down to earth from the sky Others said it was a comet Have you heard of Theory of Panspermia? They say an asteroid may have struck earth 1000s of years ago... ...from which life originated - I don't understand - I'll tell you The phenomenon of red rain in 2001 It was big news When researchers examined samples what they found was unbelievable What was it? Extraterrestrial cells They were alive Yes, I remember My grandpa had got in touch with higher authority in relation to it But that context did not move forward Professor went ahead with its research on his own Are these incidents related to the red rains? Who knows? But may be something happened Alien life would have seeded So quickly? We can't say It's possible but I'm not sure The bacteria may have settled here through the red rain Or through some other means Maybe reached earth directly from the sky In fact... ...no one knows the truth I'll take your bag, okay man Let's go Andreah Come on Hey?!
