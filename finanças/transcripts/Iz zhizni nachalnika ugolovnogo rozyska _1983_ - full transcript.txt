Citizen Judge is supposed to speak. Well, how are you a citizen when I think it's immediately obvious that citizen, because ... In the materials of the preliminary investigation there is information that your group was led by a person nicknamed "Trough" Me nothing is known about it. But your own testimony volume 2, file sheet 20: "Trough" turned off the alarm in the pharmacy. So I messed up something out of fear, citizen judge. Your so-called "Trough" led the gang and you don't know anything about him. Even a last name. So you catch this "trough", and ask him. Ha ha ha! According to your testimony, with the defendant Petrov You met at his apartment. It was July 14 in the evening. That's it boy. Right? Well, met. Tell your Trough that I thank God, alive and well.

How many fools in your life I met, it's time for me to order get, fools love to gather in flock, ahead - the main one, in all its glory. As a child, I believed that one day I would rise, and there are no clouds, they all flew away. Ah, my childhood dreams, what error, in which clouds I flew stupidly. Nature on the lips insidious smile, apparently, something I - did not calculate. BUT smart people walk alone circles, he appreciates loneliness the most and its so easy take with bare hands, soon they will be caught all to one. When they've all been caught the era will come do not invent or describe. With smart troublesome, with a fool bad, need to mean, yes, where can I get it? And it pays to be a fool Yes, I really don’t want to, smart people really want to, yes end up beating, in nature on the lips of insidious prophecies, but maybe someday find the average. Ha ha ha.

You know what, let me hang curtains in the kitchen, otherwise somehow so uncomfortable, bare windows. Quit this way of asking do as you please. Okay, then another chain on the door, and I'm afraid of thieves. Let's go, let's go, let's go and don't bother the person It's embarrassing, big girl. About what You wanted to talk to me? In general, this is the case: my don't know who I was. It's clear. So what? That is, how is that? Either way, keep your mouth shut. Who do you think I am? Oh, damn you! Take this, who do I think he is? And for whom should I consider you, citizen Malych? Don't start, so many years have passed everything has changed. Well, yes. Now you respect me. Well, why became a man, of course, respect. And I've always been human. You were a thief. Yes? Did you steal me? Well, what's the difference on what I took you. Ah, no difference? Well, yes, of course, it makes no difference to you, you anyhow sweep, and, really, for what - this the tenth thing, right. Mulya-tarzan sold me to you, and you did not disdain and bought on the cheap, that's all your work. Old yeast fermented no one handed you over, I took you myself personal, if you are interested. And, how not, I'm interested Of course, I'm interested, already 20, how interested. After robbing a dental technician, on Pervomaiskaya, we hunted for the mad one, felt it was his job, with close ones, of course, took care of you too Let's walk around then. Suddenly a surprise, you alibi, you didn't go for this case. And they bring you to the hospital Madman with your knife in his side looked into his mouth, and his teeth are brand new, with a needle. Did you insert it on Pervomaiskaya? M. Scouted the situation. Well, we thought so. Okay, you better tell me who knocked. You yourself could not know where I am, you would never have found me in your life. And I didn't look for you. I knew Razgulyay: parts and motorcycle. So I was looking for your Harley. Four or five days, sat in ambush, and on the sixth - you yourself came to me. Here is the whole game. Well done! Well done! Only then I how to say, for justice sat down. Besheny and I had my own personal scores, they not touched to the millimeter. When one cuts another even if he is mad, it's about the law. Yes, okay, come on, guardian of the law! I know these laws My crazy sidekick sewed, and, just like that, for nothing: something he told him a word across, and you do it like this... so what is it? You, rather than catch me, would rather ask where Mad is all the gold from the robbery cases? You yourself then gave him a tower. Oh, I don’t touch him with your finger? Look what logic you have! The main thing is to put it on a sheet, this wolf, the victim! Well, we found gold later. So, where did the three barrels go? Mm, gone anyway. Strange story but there were trunks. Were. Healthy trunks. I think if you dig them out, so they can hang a medal. Ay, if you dig it out. Hahaha! Something to help a neighbor according to the old, so to speak, friendship? Ay, Well, of course, if you ask nicely. Stop fooling around. Cold, I don't know anything. Burnt, your medal! Stepan believes that in a new place, until you fight, oh you won't get used. Here Nikolai is fighting, Thanks. Fist strategy. It's clear. I didn't think you liked to cook. Only once or twice a year. Mm. For inspiration. Ha. It's clear. Who is this? It's hot sauce. And is he squirming? It pricks, it pricks. Well, you, just like an alchemist! Thank you for the compliment. The alchemists were a capable people. Yes? Yes, it's the same pseudoscience, Ivan Konstantinovich. They didn't succeed. Well, why didn't it work out? Something came out truth with gold and philosophical they blundered with a stone, but stainless iron, nitric and sulfuric acid - turned out. Weigh with your feet. The great alchemist Nostradamus, by the way, wrote a treatise on jam and first came up with method of long-term storage of products, So you think it was science not quackery? I think that at its core, though, science. Remember in the Queen of Spades Count Saint Germain, who discovered countess three cards? And how about: troika, semyorka, tuz. Yes, and so, this same graph, By the way, he actually existed, there were a lot of fables about him, but it is known for certain that he could clean diamonds, remove stains from them. Whew with your feet! So, it's ready. Hostess, I'll ask everyone for plates. Now. So. Na-na. So, so, let's put, put, put. Sit down. And a little viyka to me? And here she is. So. Come on? On the. M, a very unusual taste! African dish in Russian. Wonderful! Delicious? Ugh, delicious. It's delicious, if Anyuta I liked it, it's great. Eat, how, after all, this Saint-Germain cleaned diamonds? In modern science only one way is known: beam of neutrons but this requires a nuclear reactor, it turns out that Fent Saint-Germain had some kind of his own, another way. Miracles! Yeah. Hello. Hello. May I come to you? Please. Disgusting weather, and I forgot my umbrella. I hope Kolya warned about my arrival? Kolya and his mother went to the cinema. Are you a father? No, my father is away, I'm a neighbor. Excuse me, please. What the hell who, who asked them to meddle? Tell me what I forbid I don't care, after half an hour. I'm waiting. I I thought that for a start the neighbor is even better, outsider objective person. Are you from school? Yes, I am the class teacher, Tatyana Georgievna. I am Ivan Konstantinovich. Yes. Please, please. Are you wet? Take off your shoes. Ah, thanks. Do you want cognac? Oh no, no! Well, why, I'm just a neighbor, and you catch a cold. Here's your medicine please. Ivan Konstantinovich, Kolya is fighting, a real disaster, Moreover, he is physically well developed, so... Are your boys passing? Tell me please about his parents, it will be easier for me talk to them. Slepneva - wife by vocation, loves her boyfriend and considers him the ideal of a real man. Now there are still such natures, like Slepneva. I think that I will it's hard to get along with her. Well, what about Slepnev? Well, here we have such virtues as: strength, fearlessness, the ability to overcome fate, yes, this is the set. It seems to me that Kolya seeks to imitate his father. Ah, that's how. Yes. Curious how you manage with Slepnyov senior. He can't ruin his career, he not prestigious, and therefore invulnerable. Katatinych, the muytics are over, I'm bored. Don't interfere, we're talking.

Well, the joke is with her, she came, she came. Eat. M, I can’t figure out what kind of thing I eat. Like? At first it's wonderful, but when you eat it - it's delicious. To her. This is Ivan Konstantinovich... Yes? And I thought it was normal meat. Meat and eat, all with sauce, Ivan Konstantinovich gave... And I see a neighbor here without me turned around. Stepan. This sister is good I'm sitting on his closet. Dad, what do you have against him? You didn't even talk to him. He is an interesting person and his head cooks. Well, I don't like it!
