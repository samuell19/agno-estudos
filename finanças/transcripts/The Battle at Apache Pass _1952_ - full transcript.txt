- Soldiers burn their fort and ride away. - Why is this? - Who speaks? - Little Elk, brother of Cochise. Just because they fear the warriors of the Apaches, Cochise is a friend of the soldiers. His young brother should grow to be a warrior, he shall ride with me, Geronimo. You build a new wickiup? Why? Because the time draws near for me to bear the child of Cochise. And here, the first light of the rising sun... will warm the little one I shall hold in my arms. With such a wise mother, the little one will grow strong. And learn to care for his people as his father does. You've been hunting for three days and yet you bring back no meat. I found no deer, I rode with Geronimo. I warned you that Geronimo and his followers are evil. He is a wise leader, he showed me strange things. The soldiers burned their fort and rode away. - Such things cannot be. - I do not lie. On the mountains, I saw these things with my own eyes. And Geronimo was promised that when I am a warrior, I shall ride at his side. You shall ride no more with Geronimo. For the space of one moon you would not stray from here. You'll gather wood and grind corn. Gather wood, grind corn? That is a woman's work. Nono does said work with love and kindness. Some of these may find its way into your heart. My husband is worried because of the words of Little Elk? When soldiers leave, Geronimo will start raiding the wagon trains. Many of our young warriors will ride with him. Tomorrow we'll go to Fort Buchanan to learn about things we do not understand. Prepare to mount, mount. Left, turn. Go. Present, sabers. - It's Cochise. - And he's got his little lady with him. Carry sabers. It is good to see the Major again. A visit from Cochise always warms the heart of his friend. The deer is for you and your soldiers. You're very kind. Sergeant, see that the deer is taken to the kitchen. Yes sir. - Talk between friends is good. - Walk with me. - Is all well in the mountains little lady? - All is well. That's fine, fine. Lot of steaks in that baby. Strange words have reached my ears. They say the soldiers burn their forts and ride away, why is this? Far beyond where the sun rises, my people make war upon each other. Many of the soldiers have to go to that war. The white-eyes tell the Apaches they must live in peace, that war is bad. Now they fight each other. That because hatred has blinded their eyes and they'll talk only with weapons. Here, an Apache wrongs one of my people... one of my people wrongs an Apache, we meet and talk. The wrong is made right. The peace is not broken. - Will you burn this fort and go to the war? - I will not leave. The heart of Cochise is glad. Cochise had a right sudden way of leaving sir. An Apache never says goodbye. Return... sabers, fall out to the right. - Well, here come the replacements. - Yeah. Halt. Prepare to dismount, dismount. Recognise him? - Mescal Jack, Fort Apache. - That's right. You can smell him from here to the Rio Grande. Sir, Lt Bascom reporting, with 30 troopers a mounting batteries and two howitzers. Glad to have you with us Mr. Bascom. Your men too, but what am I supposed to do with those? - Mr Baylor requested them sir. - Mr Baylor requested? Yes sir. He's arriving tonight, I expect you've been notified of his assignment. Yes, but I wasn't notified he was coming equipped with a battery of artillery. Begging your pardon sir. Mr. Baylor says you never can tell what will come on handy in Indian country. Sgt Bernard here will see that your men are assign to their barracks. Thank you sir. Roberts, you will walk your horses for a 30 minutes cool off. After that you'll be assigned to your barracks, dismiss. Now sergeant, I'd like to see my quarters. - Yes sir. Corporal Hassett. - Yes Sergeant. - Show Lt Bascom to his quarters. - This way sir. Long time no see, eh Sergeant? Not since the Major booted you out of Fort Apache. I'm working for Baylor this time. No Indian loving brass hat is going to kick me out of Fort Buchanan. You can chew on that sergeant. So you're working for Baylor? Well, just to show I've got no hard feelings, I'll give you a hand with your gear. Oh, I busted your liquor ration, now ain't that too bad. You've done that on purpose. Get this. Let me catch you hauling any more mescal to the Indians... and I'll kick your tail right through your belly. You familiar with this territory, Mr Baylor? In a general way, I've never been out here before, of course. A finer man always thinks better when he's relaxed. Salut. Looking over you record I found that you were offered a promotion... if you transferred to the war in the east. You turned down that promotion to remain here at Fort Buchanan, may I ask why? I serve where I'm needed most. And you consider yourself the indispensable man in these parts, eh? Sometimes conditions make a man's job seem pretty important to him. Scattered across the territories of New Mexico and Arizona... we've now only about 700 soldiers, all told. There are about 7,000 Apache warriors all around us. Cochise, the leader of the Chiricahuas Apaches... is the greatest single power among Apache chieftains. Cochise is my friend. And you rely on this friendship with Cochise to keep the peace? I find friendship preferable to mounting batteries Mr Baylor. I can see you're an idealist Major. Well, that's good, because I am too. Have you ever thought about the future of this territory Major? It's tremendous. The white man will inevitably move in and take it over. And when that day comes, the men here on the spot are... going to be in a position of enormous power. - Men like you? - And you. And the Apaches? Well, right now your job is to keep them quiet, that's fine. But in the long run of course, other dispositions will have to be made off. I've seen the dispositions made of the Indians... populations in other territories Mr Baylor. I don't think I care for the job. Well, now perhaps you care to show me to my quarters. Bolham? - Sir? - Show Mr Baylor to his quarters. - Yes sir. - Thank you. Oh, Mr Baylor, I don't mean to tell you your business... but I understand you have an Indian scout working for you named Mescal Jack. Yeah, I picked him up at the Bend Country, been big help to me. Seems to know a lot about this territory. Yes, and he's a drunk, a thief and a general all around troublemaker. 2 years ago I kicked him off the post of Fort Apache for selling whiskey to the Indians. - I thought you want to know. - He didn't tell me about that. Well, I guess we'll have to keep an eye on him, good night. Now what? I told Lt Bascom that he'd find a campaign hat... more serviceable in this territory than that regulation kepi he's wear. What he say? He said, Sergeant, army rules and regulations... prescribe the kepi and it's precisely what I shall continue to wear. Well, give him time Neil, he'll season out. What about Baylor? Mr Baylor thinks the Indians ought to go back where they came from. Some adviser, we have to listen to him? We're under orders to co-operate with him, afraid it's going to be difficult. Hate to see you leave Miss Kearney. Wish we had a school, we sure keep you here. I'm afraid that you and Mr Ward, his son Mickey would be my only pupils. Ward and Mickey are pretty smart, for me I figure I could use some learning. Yeah, then I'll send you some school books from Tucson. - Take good care of Miss Kearney. - We sure will. You figure we'll make Buffalo Springs by dark? You be all five thirsty if you don't Youngfellow. Looks like you be taking a trip to Tucson, she's mighty pretty. - Stop reading my mind John. - Come on Mickey, let's go to work. This is the route used by the US Mail and the... Butterfield-Oregon stage from St Louis to San Francisco. It has to go through Apache Pass. Now, that's Chiricahua Apache country as I understand. That's right. Now, suppose those Chiricahuas were to move in on that pass. They'd cut off all traffic east and west in this whole section of the country. The Chiricahuas wouldn't dream on such a thing. Particularly with a man like Cochise as their leader. Alright, maybe they wouldn't. But suppose I gave you a plan to make certain that they couldn't. Like what? Simple, to move the Chiricahuas out of there and over onto the San Carlos. Mr Baylor, in the first place, there's no food for them on the San Carlos. The government would feed them. They're funny people, they like to feed themselves. And in the second place, they wouldn't go. They'd go if the military commander this... area were given enough reinforcements to make them go. Oh, just like that, eh? Major, you know I wouldn't think of pulling rank on you. No, as a civilian I guess you wouldn't. But I must tell you there are a number of men who think that what I've suggested is a very practical solution to the problem. As a matter of fact, the only solution. Mr Baylor, you came out here to advise me. I assume that's what you're trying to do, in good faith. Now, I'm going to give you some advice. If you were even to attempt to carry out such a proposal you just outlined... you'd drown this territory in a bloodbath that would go on for years. And if your friends are crazy enough or greedy enough to try such a thing... you tell them they better use their influence to get another military commander out here. Because I'm not their man. Don't tempt me Major, that I might even be able to do that. - It's a patrol coming sir. - They're sure in a hurry to get here. Wagon train massacred at Buffalo Springs sir. I'd figure it happened about dawn yesterday, the wagons were still burning. Mr Bascom, call up two platoons main troop. See that each man had six days' rations and 50 rounds of ammunition. - How many victims? - Oh, I didn't look too close sir. There were women and kids among them. Them Apaches mutilated those poor devils some awful. - Chiricahua Apaches? - No way of telling. We'll be riding near the village of the Chiricahuas Mr. Baylor, I suggest you come along and meet Cochise, before you make any more plans. Alright, you kind of make me curious to see this noble savage of yours. Group, halt. You got here pretty fast Major, but I doubt you'll catch the devils a drift.. By now they're likely to be across the Mexican border into Chihuahua. Or maybe the returned to the wickiups of the Chiricahuas. Curver, this is Mr Baylor, the new Indian adviser. He holds to the opinion that Cochise's people are responsible for the massacre. No Chiricahua did that job mister. No sir, they know better, Cochise would stake them out over an anthill. - Any ideas of who might've done it? - None for sure. But if I had to guess, that'd say is Geronimo and some of his mangis warriors. The wagon train camped three nights back Major. There was a girl with them, Mary Kearney, was going to teach school in Tucson. She was pretty, real pretty. I sure hope you catch up with those murdering renegades Major. - Mr Bascom. - Sir? Water the horses and take a burial detail to Buffalo Springs. You catch over any Apaches who show fight, they're the ones we're after. Mescal Jack will ride with you. He's supposed to be a good tracker. You ready Mr Baylor, I'll take you to Cochise. Well, so Little Elk is been a bad boy, eh? Cochise. I'd not expected to see you, but my heart is glad. This is Mr Baylor, he come from Washington to take charge of Indian Affairs. A friend of the Major is welcome in my village. Cochise, some of my people where in the land of the Chiricahuas, they came in peace. Now, because of bad Indians their bodies rot beside their burnt wagons in Buffalo Springs. Does the man of Indian Affairs think the evil ones were Chiricahuas? I told him they were not. Yet you come to see Cochise not without reason. I came to warn you that unless the guilty Apaches are... turned over to the military within one week... I shall order the Chiricahuas to move their villages over on San Carlos reservation. Bad spirits live on the San Carlos. The flies eat out the eyes of the horses. There's no deer, no elk, my people would go hungry. The government would see that the Apaches receive food. If the Apaches fail to obey all the orders of the white eyes, they would receive no food. My orders would've to be obeyed presently. There is something for the eyes of this man to see. Many years ago, the Spanish conquistadores came to the land of the Apaches. They were treated as friends until they sought to make the Apaches their slaves, First with threats, then with weapons. The Apaches are still here. Look well upon of what all that remains of the conquistadores. Hear me, man of Indian Affairs. This is the home of the Chiricahuas, the spirit land of our fathers... we will not leave. Now I say this, I will speak words at the council fire... and see that the bad Apaches who attacked your... people are driven from the land of the Chiricahuas. Peace has been broken, evil Apaches have attacked and burnt a wagon train. Now the soldiers seek them. I think it is work of Geronimo. The new man of Indian Affairs does not... look into the heart of an Apache to see if it is black or red. So to keep him from sending his soldiers against all of us... Geronimo must be banished of the land of the Apaches. Many white eyes are dead, their soldier burnt their fort and ride away in fear. The Apache warriors are many, they are strong. They can drive the white eyes from the land of the Apache. Hear me Geronimo, I, Cochise, say this. The Chiricahuas will not break this peace. From this day forth, the wickiups of the Chiricahuas are closed to you. You will ride from this land or my warriors will hunt you down and kill you. Hear me, mighty warriors of Apache nation. I, Geronimo, say this. Cochise talks with a woman's tongue. Ride with me mighty warriors, wetting your lances in the blood of the white eyes, Drive them from our land. The decision has been reached, Geronimo must ride alone. The maid with the hair of copper shall not go. I, Nega, captured the maid with the hair of copper, she is mine, she goes with me. She does not go. The mighty Cochise is a woman, he fears to fight against the strong arm of Nega. You must not fight over this maid with the hair of copper. If you should die, I would die also. I've accepted the challenge and must fight, is the law of the Apaches. The Apaches are warriors no longer, their eyes are blind, there mind goes stupid... there is no fire in their hearts. The white eyes will spill their blood like rain. The evil Apaches have done you great wrong, the heart of Cochise is sad. My wife Nono will take care of you. Why do you hate me so? My husband fought Nega for you. His eyes no longer see me, they see only the fires in your hair. I now cut it off, then my husband will see only me. I don't care what you do. My husband wishes me to go to another wickiup? The night would be lonely without you by my side. Tomorrow we will take her to the Major. Guards, turn out. Guards, turn out. That must be the Kearney girl that Culver spoke about. Beware of Indians bearing gifts Major. Present, sabers. The bad Indians were not Chiricahuas but Mangions, the leader was Geronimo. The wickiups of the Apache nation have been closed to him. - I'm Major Colton ma'am. - I'm Mary Kearney Major. Yes I know, I'm sure you want to rest after the terrible ordeal you've been through. Dr Carter, I'm turning my quarters over to Miss Kearney, please attend to her. Oh, I'm alright Major but Cochise was wounded when... he fought the Indian who take me prisoner. I'll have a look at that Cochise, come along with me Miss Kearney. The maid with the hair of copper would make a good wife. It's not right that a man should live alone. You better have the doctor look at that arm. Now the wound is cleaned of infection it will heal. After seven days you may remove the bandage. Medicine of the white eyes is strong. It'll always be here for Cochise when he needs it. Geronimo rides away. If the man of Indian Affairs rides away also, there'll be no need for strong medicine. Cochise makes strong talk Major, but it makes a whale of a lot of sense. This sort of life must be quite different from what you're accustomed to Miss Kernay. Yes, it is Major. But it is interesting and colorful and... very flattering, especially since I'm the only woman here. I think before I'm spoiled completely you better send me out to Tucson. I won't send you anywhere, not as long if I can find excuses to keep you here. - When you get back? - I was pulled in by an hour ago. You find Geronimo's trail? Yeah, I found it, kind of forgot to tell the lieutenant. You didn't tell me that Cochise was a mighty smart Indian, he'll never cross Colton. Well, maybe we're just a little smarter though. You think Geronimo will do what we want him to? You promise him guns and ammunition, he'd sell out his own mother. We leave in a couple of hours. You sure Geronimo understand that was a peace talk signal? Don't worry Mr Baylor, your hide will be safe with what you got to offer him. Is Geronimo remember his friend Mescal Jack? - Geronimo has no friends. - But he has enemies. Because of Cochise, the wickiups of the Apache are closed to Geronimo. And he'll be killed if he's found in the land of the Apaches. Who speaks? A friend who brings whiskey, bullets and many new carbines such as this. - What is it you want? - That the Chiricahuas were to break peace. The soldiers would kill Cochise, the enemy of Geronimo... and drive the Chiricahuas from the mountains. You're a fool. Cochise is a friend of the soldiers. Suppose something were to happen to make Cochise hate the soldiers. Talk. There's a stage driver by the name of Johnny Ward, he has a ranch near Buffalo Springs. His got a wife and a young son called Mickey. Once these Apaches are under control, there'll be a great... future for this territory Miss Kearney. Of course the Major here doesn't agree... he believes in treating them as visiting royalty. There's good and evil in every race Mr. Baylor and... after all, this is the Apaches' country and we are the intruders. Looks as though you won another convert Major, what's your opinion Doctor? As a military surgeon... I've seen enough bloodshed and suffering caused by men with your point of view to... be in violent disagreement with your every sentiment. You seem to be a grapple short of converts, I do out in this country anyway. Begging you pardon sir, but Johnny Ward here is in trouble. The Apaches raided his ranch, killed his wife and took his son Mickey. Those dirty Chiricahuas did that to me, me, Johnny Ward is always been their friend. Chiricahuas, eh? What make you so sure they were Chiricahuas? Oh, Mickey must've shot one before they took him. I found this around his neck, the Thunderbird of the Chiricahua tribe. I'll have a look at this dead Chiricahua. Is that all you going to do Major? Have a look? For the moment yes, because it doesn't makes sense, the Chiricahuas aren't that stupid. - They aren't? - Ever hear of planted evidence Mr. Baylor? - Sergeant, you stay here with Lt Bascom. - Yes sir. Come along with me Johnny. I' guess I'd better boil my instruments, looks as though I'm going to need them. I'm afraid I don't quite follow you Mr Baylor. I'm going to speak very frankly with you lieutenant, I've been send out here to clean up this territory. In order to do so, I need an intelligent and reliable military commander in the field. Major Colton is not competent to that assignment. Major Colton is my superior officer. And right now he's out on a wild goose chase. While his friend Cochise is up in the hills with the... blood of a white woman on his hands and a kidnapped white boy in his possession. And here's the proof of it. I want you to go up there and get that boy back. If you succeed and I know you will, I can guarantee a promotion. I can fix a meeting for you with Cochise, easy. And I can fix it so he'll have to turn over the kid. I can't take orders from you. With Colton and Harley gone, you're the ranking officer on this post. You can issue your own orders. - Sergeant, sergeant Bernard. - Yes sir. We're riding out, two platoons with full equipment, notify me as soon as you're ready. - By whose orders? - By my orders. Yes sir. Such work is for women. Not for young men who have learned to walk in the ways of peace. Soldiers are camped near the springs, they have a message for you. The Major is with them? No, he ain't. The soldiers say the ranch of Johnny Ward was raided by the Chiricahuas. - They killed his wife and took his kid. - No Chiricahua would such a thing. The lieutenant has proof they did. He says Cochise better bring the kid and the chiricahuas raiders to his camp. I will question my leaders about this, tomorrow I will come speak to the lieutenant. Lieutenant. He ain't got the Ward kid with him lieutenant, he's up to his old tricks. As soon as those Indians are inside my tent, carry out my order. Begging Lieutenant's pardon sir... When I want advice, I'll ask for it sergeant. Lieutenant Bascom, in command of the detail from Fort Buchanan. - Talk is a good thing. - Let's go to my tent. Evil has been done. The hearts of the Chiricahuas are sad for their friends. Yet they did not bring in the Ward boy they stole... nor the warriors that committed this evil. Last night I questioned the leaders of my people... none have seen the boy and none are guilty. This was taken from the neck of a dead Apache at the Ward ranch. It's the mark of the Chiricahua. One of my people rode away with Geronimo. - That sure must come from the dead one. - What I tell you lieutenant? You blamed the wagon train massacre on Geronimo and you got away with it. This time the Army will swallow no more of your lies. All your people know I do not lie. Guards. Hear me, soldiers. Other Indians have done this bad thing you accuse of us of. The Chiricahuas are your friends. Here Little lady, drink some of this. - Cochise does not lie. - Sure, I know. It's all been a bad mistake, it'll be straightened out, so don't you worry. - Sergeant. - Yes sir? - You gave orders to saddle up? - That's right sir. Why? If Cochise comes after that young his wife of his sir, we'll have to pull out fast. We taught that Indian a lesson lieutenant, he won't attack. He'll be back with that Ward kid... and them Chiricahuas we're after to trade his squaw. Have the men unsaddle. Yes sir. Hit the saddle, return to the stage station. Sergeant Bernard, take charge of the prisoners. Get them in the wagon. Forward, ho. I don't gave a plaster on what the army thinks... if Cochise says his Chiricahuas ain't guilty, they ain't. But because the Army thinks different, we're bottled up here with his warriors on both sides of the pass. I'm satisfied, if we have to I can fight my way out. Let's be reasonable lieutenant, maybe Cochise will pull out if you let the prisoners go. You're crazy, the only reason he don't attack is because we hold them prisoner. I'll surrender nothing to that lying scoundrel. It is not Cochise who lies. It is you. Look lieutenant, I've always found Cochise to be a mighty reasonable hombre. Why not turn his squaw loose? Maybe she can talk him into coming in for parley... we can try to straighten this mess out. Nono, you take these words to your husband. Tell him if he comes carrying white flag, I'll talk to him. If he refuses, I'll take my prisoners to Fort Buchanan. It is one more trick to catch Cochise. Let me explain it to her sir. Look, little lady... this white flag is big medicine. It mean that Cochise will be safe... because Apaches and soldiers will stop fighting and make talk. - It's a sort of... - I understand white flag, but does he? Sure he does, all soldiers must obey the white flag. - Will you be there? - You bet I will little lady. Then I go. Little lady, tell Cochise he must be patient. That the lieutenant is new here and he don't understand Apaches. Now, off with you. And good luck to all of us. Soldiers have given Nono back to me, I give him his life. Remember men, the first wrong move, open fire. Be on guard, watch out the treachery. Hear me soldier of the white eyes. We've lived at peace with your people, is not always been easy but we've done it. Why do you now break this peace? Why do you accuse me of things that other Indians have done? And take my people prisoner and try to kill me? Why is this? Until the white boy and the guilty Chiricahuas are turned over to me... I'm holding these prisoners. Let go of me. I'm your friend. Back to the station. Hold your fire. Hear me for the last time. Release the chiricahuas prisoners and I will return Culver to you. Don't trust him Lieutenant. There can be no more talk between us until the Ward boy is returned. They'll kill me if you don't lieutenant, Them prisoners you got, they're Cochise's brother and two of his cousins. - Sir, you can't let them kill Culver. - I'll handle this. Handle it the devil. The Army's job is to protect the civilian population not get them murder. When we return to Buchanan... you'll stand court martial for insubordination in the field. Cochise has proven himself... to be a lying, treacherous scoundrel. I'll have no more dealings with him, this is final. I'll teach that red devil to respect the United States Army. Hang those three Chiricahuas from that tree. The days and nights will be lonely without you, my wife. When you are away, something dies in here. - Let me go with you. - No. You must finish the new wickiup. Prepare yourself for the coming of our little one. Great Spirit of the White Mountain... guard well my wife and our little one who's to come. Hear me, warriors of the Chiricahuas. Like snakes the soldiers have turned against us. They killed Little Elk, my brother. They killed Two Back, my cousin. They killed Deer Foot. Because of this, many white-eyes will die. Our women and children will remain in the stronghold. There they will be protected from the evil eyes of our enemies. In the fighting to come we must be wise as well as strong. Therefore, is the Apaches who will choose the battlegrounds. We will fight them from ambush, from behind rocks, in ravines and in mountain passes. We will not put down our weapons until they have been... killed or driven from the land of the Apache. The enemies of Geronimo are the enemies of Cochise, brother. The eyes of Cochise have been open, soon all the tribes of the Apache nation will join us. Death to all white-eyes. Column, halt. That isn't just Geronimo talking, that sounds like the whole Apache nation. But why? Maybe there's your answer Major. What is this Mr Bascom? - We were caught in a trap, Cochise... - Cochise? - Sergeant... - Sorry sir, I'm under arrest. For insubordination in the field sir. - Alright, let's have it. - Major... You'll answer when I spoke to you. Well? Well sir, the lieutenant ordered a party after a meeting with... Cochise to try get Johnny Ward's kid back. Cochise was told that we going to hold his wife and brother as hostages and that did it. Now Culver is dead and three Chiricahuas hanged. Afraid the fat is in the fire Major. - Is that true? - Yes sir. How dare you take a company of my men into... the Indian country with out a direct order from me? - I did it on my own responsibility. - It was Baylor's idea sir. Oh, Baylor, eh? The only reason I don't order immediate court martial... for you Mr. Bascom is because I'm going to need every man I got. Because by the looks of things, you and your friend Baylor have finally... succeeded in bringing the whole Apache nation down around our ears. - Now, get to your quarters. - Yes sir. - Get your side arms and come with me. - Yes sir. You too, Soldier. I'll be seeing you Baylor. Where you going? You and your big ideas, territorial governor. Mr. Baylor, you're under military arrest. Stay with him, don't let him out of your sight. Yes sir. - Colton, I warn you... - I do what I said do... I think I have you shot. Got nicked? Only went through your coat, eh? Too bad. Take him to his quarters. - Young buck out to make a name for himself. - Chiricahua? Doesn't tell us much. If only Chiricahuas we might still be able to patch it up with Cochise. But if it's all the tribes... - Bascom. - Sir. - Harley. - Yes sir. I got a job for you two. You'll take A Troop to Mr. Bascom. Mr Harley, you'll take K Troop. You ride together to the river, then divide... swing in opposite circles back to the rendezvous at Eagle Rocks. Your mission is to find out just what tribes are on the warpath. Don't take chances. Draw fire if you have to, but don't take chances. - Is that clear? - Yes sir. Alright. - Bascom... - Sir? Thanks for the nice shooting. K Troop, fall out. Fall out at the double. A Troop, fall out, fall out. A Troop, on the double. Take me to Geronimo. I'm his friend, take me to him. Take me to him, I'm his friend. I come to warn you Cochise... that the soldiers now ride to drive the Chiricahuas from the villages. I need no warning from you. Your lying tongue is broken the peace and brought death to many of my people. You shall lie no more. Platoon, halt. Burning wagons. It's only about Apaches inside, it might be a trap sir. A trap for the Apaches Corporal. Forward, ho. Halt. Fan out, fan out. Open fire. Over those rocks. Don't fire until you sure of your targets. What made them withdraw corporal? We're boxed in, they'll wait later afternoon, when the sun is blazing right in our eyes. Then they'll rush us. Maybe this will help sir. It's good advice Hassett. Thanks. It's better. - Here they come sir, the whole bunch. - Get ready men, keep your sabers handy. What devil? - I see the guidon form K Troop. - It sure is. It is the guidon of K Troop. Hey men, it's the guidon of K Troop. Those patrols should've been back long ago. What do you think of life on an Army post now Mary? - Well, it is a little rough. - Too rough I'm afraid for a woman. I don't know, that would depend on the woman, wouldn't it? You know what Cochise said to me the day he brought you in? - No. - He said... it is not good for a man to live alone. Oh? - You know, he could be right. - Could he? They're back Major, they're back. Corporal Hassett warned we might be riding into a trap, I disagreed. And so you charged in blindly, chin up, chest up colors flying? Yes sir, if it hadn't been for K Troop, we would've been in real trouble. What happened to your regulation cap Mr Bascom? I found it unsuitable for this territory sir. - We might make a soldier out of you yet. - Yes sir. Mr Harley, what tribes were sighted by your patrol? Mogollons, Coyoteros, Chiricahuas sir. So, they're all gathering for the kill. Gentlemen, we're abandoning Fort Buchanan and retiring on Fort Sheridan. Alert all personnel, be ready to leave at daybreak. Yes sir. Fort Sheridan? If Cochise will let us through Apache Pass. Column, halt. Not an Apache in sight. Mr Harley, I'm going up ahead. Keep your carbines trained on the rocks. You're not going through the pass alone, are you sir? No sir. Let's go Major. Draw carbines, keep at them ready. Column, forward, ho. Voyagers, to the right, move. No, no. Geronimo's friend. Geronimo, I'm your friend. You promised Geronimo carbines and bullets for taking Ward boy, where are they? The soldiers took them, they make me prisoner. The soldiers will have to fight their way to the springs ahead or soon die of thirst. They not live to reach the springs. Cochise has us ringed in tight and we got to reach those springs up ahead. We'll blast them out the rocks with the howitzers. They've never come up against shellfire before. It's them or us, Mr. Harley. - Bring the battery into action. - Yes sir. - Bascom. - Sir? Mr. Bascom, cover the battery with your first platoon. Right. Battery one, forward. First platoon, follow me. Swing around. Swing around quickly. They bring small wagons. Prepare to fire. Fire. Fire. Strange weapons. Can spill the blood \of our warriors like water. Fire. Fire. Nono. Why did you leave the stronghold? My heart was filled with fear for you. I could not stay away. You must not think of me, must think of the little one. Fire. Let us charge down and kill them before they kill us. No, our warriors we would die before they could reached the soldiers. We must move to the heights above us.. Fire. Fire. Nono. Nono. - Starting to regroup higher up in the rocks. - Looks like they had enough of the guns. Sir, two Indians coming out of the pass carrying a white flag. - One of them is Cochise. - Fire. - Mr Bascom, rejoin your group. - Yes sir. - Order cease fire. - Yes sir. Cease fire. Nono is been hurt. - I bring her to the white medicine man. - Poor little lady. We'll do all we can for her. Dr Carter... Hear me, warriors of the Apaches. Cochise ordered you to stay among the rocks, then the fire wagons spoke. Now many warriors lie dead among those rocks, Cochise thinks only of his squaw. He is no longer your leader. I, Geronimo, will be your leader. - Why do you help a woman of the Apaches? - Why did you save me from Nega? My little one. Hold onto her arms tightly. Don't be afraid Nono, the doctor will help you. Does the white flag mean nothing to you? Cochise does not break his word, it is Geronimo. Fire. Suspend fire, suspend fire. Are the Apaches without honor, that they attack... while their leader carries a white flag? Cochise no longer leads the Apaches, it is I, Geronimo. Kill me, let me enter the spirit land of my fathers like a warrior, kill me. Geronimo shall live but as an outcast who must forever walk alone. And Apache shall spit upon him, for he is no longer a warrior. Let no warrior again draw weapons under the white flag. Nono. Our little one is a man child. And I have not finished the new wickiup. With rest and quiet, Nono will soon grow strong again. Wear it, no harm will come to you at the hands of Apaches. Each night I shall pray for your happiness... and that your little one shall walk always in the ways of peace. My heart is glad to learn it was the man of Indian Affairs that broke the peace... and not the Apaches. Yet he couldn't have broken the peace without the help of Geronimo. But now, the man of Indian Affairs is dead and Geronimo is an outcast. - Let us talk words of peace. - The hearts of my people are angry. Fire wagons had killed many warriors, their blood darkens the rocks. Their spirits cry for vengeance. Go to Fort Sheridan. When the wounds have healed and blood goes pales upon the rocks... then we again talk of peace.
