(soft music) (lively music) (radio chatter) (lively music) (radio chatter) (lively music) - Mr. Mayor, are you here? Jerry, you're not dead are you? - I'm not dead. I'm just grabbing a few bottles. You're lucky Gary, you got one job people rely on you for. No one appreciates what I go through every time we have a town hall meeting here, everyone cramming in and nobody buying anything. - Well, maybe it's time to build a new town hall. - Ah, with what money? - Any luck with getting the cable companies in this town? - You're lucky I got us internet. - Yeah, but it's like dial up. It's too damn slow. - Why are you here? - I wanted to see if maybe we could have tonight's town hall meeting at the church. - Why the hell would we do that? It's clear on the other side of town. - It's right there. It's like two blocks away. - We have been having the town hall meetings here for years. - You're gonna get Rakesh Nibhanupudi to open the bar. - Who the hell is Rakesh? - It's the guy from the Environmental Protection Agency. - The EPA? - Jesus, Jerry, he's coming to talk to the town tonight. - What are you talking about? - It has something to do with Muellers. - There is nothing wrong with our chemical plant. Well, we make one of a, a hundred compounds used in dog shampoo. (chuckling) - Would you call Father O'Dell? - Why the hell would I do that? - To have the meeting at the church. Jerry it's the federal government. - Christ. You do it. I'm not asking that man for any favors. - [Gary] Just pick up the phone and call him. - No. - [Gary] You're the mayor of this town. So you should call-- - [Jerry] I know who I am. - [Gary] Then call Father O'Dell. - [Jerry] No. - One of these days, you're gonna have to tell me what this rival's about. Father, it's Gary O'Reilly. I'm over at the pub with the mayor and we think it might be a good idea if the meeting in tonight was at the church. I know it's a little last minute. Hold on. - What, no. No. Hello father. This is the mayor speaking. The town needs a, but I am the mayor. I didn't just call you Wesley, Wesley. - Jerry. - The town would be much obliged. Yeah, fine. I would be much obliged if we could use the church this evening for the town hall meeting. Uh huh. (chuckling) You spineless son. Yeah, oh yeah, you wanna do that to me? Oh no. Well, I'll tell you what, why don't you meet me at the school gym tomorrow and we'll settle this just like men. I'll knock you to the ground, you Nancy boy. Booyah! - Hello father. Goddammit. Did you just start a fight with a priest - It's a long time coming, Gary. You must not worry. It's a primal ritual of, of men battling mono-a-mono until somebody dies. - No one is gonna die tomorrow. - In the ring, anything can happen, Gary - I gotta let everyone know about the changes tonight. I'll see you later, okay. - You should have come to me sooner with that news. (soft music) - Hey, we need to shut down pump two and crank up three and four. - You want me to bleed the valves from two? - Hey sheriff. No, not yet. - Hey Gary. - What can I do you for? - Town's meetings been moved to the church tonight. What's going on? - The Environmental Protection Agency is running us through the mill about getting these new protocols in place. They didn't waste any time. - Don't they need the town's approval for that? - They showed me federal papers. We didn't have a choice. Everything went online yesterday. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - I'll let everyone know. - I'll see you tonight. (soft music) - Introduce me. - No. - Introduce me. - [Father O'Dell] No. - [Jerry] You have to introduce me. - Introduce yourself. - Introduce me. - No. - Dammit, O'Dell introduce me. - We know who you are, Jerry. Stand up there. - All right, hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome to the quarterly Kilnerry town hall meeting. Oh, it's good to see you all. It's been a long winter, but spring is here. Oh, we've got graduation coming up. Some of our young folks will be heading off to college soon. (chuckling) Oh, and for those of you who haven't heard, the Kilnerry Gazette has closed down. Well, now, as I've been telling folks for a while now, we were expecting a representative from the federal government to speak to us this evening. Well, now I've been working very closely with them, but why don't I let you meet him yoursel Let's let's give a big hand for Mr. Rakesh Najaputi. (audience applauds) - Thanks. That was close. Please rise. Okay, I was just kidding you guys, you, you can all sit down. I just always wanted to say that, so. (chuckling) Does he need help? So hi, I am from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a part of the federal governmen I don't use usually talk to audiences about these kinds of things. I don't actually talk to audiences at all, really. We've just been short staffed where I work. So they, they just sent me, but I'm actually just a chemist. And so hi. Okay, as you may or may not know, there has been a to international pressu on our country to reduce our environmental footprint. The chemical plant that is here in Kilnerry is the only plant in the state that produces a chemical compound called propylene glycol, which is used in dog shampoos. However, the process the plant utilizes to make that compound also results in the creation of some dangerous byproducts, like sulfuric acids and alkaline, which can run off into the waters. And for a large fishing community like yours, the buildup of-- - 25% Of the state's catch. - Okay, cool. So for a large fishing community like yours, the buildup of those dangerous byproduct can be devastating for the local Marine life. It may already have had devastating effects. You guys could be distributing toxic fish to the country. And we would know that it came from you guys, came from here because of the chemical plant here. So my agency came up with a solution to fix the problem. We found out that if we switch off one of the chemicals utilized by your plant for a new chemical, things could be solved. And that new chemical is called P172. - Your hearing aid is feeding back. - What? - I said, your hearing aid is feeding back. - I, I can't hear a damn thing she's saying. - So basically, Kilnerry, you guys, this town has been chosen to be the flagship town to, to test out this new process, this new chemical. But before we implement it at the other propylene glycol chemical plants across the country. - The flagship town. Well, that's quite an honor! - Hey, hearing aid! - Take it out, I'll tell you later. - Please go on Mister, (muttering). - Yeah. However, there is one slight side effect associated with P172 we just recently discovered. But aside from that, the whole process should be seamless. - What side effect? - Uh huh. - You said there'd be one slight side effect. What, what's the side effect? - Yes there is. And you know what? I think you're gonna find it kind of fun because when I heard about it, I thought it was hilarious. It's act, it's actually not that funny. We discovered that when laboratory rats are exposed to P172, they experience a dramatic increase in their (mumbles). - What? Speak up. - There is a dramatic increase in sexual libido. - Oh is that, is that a dance? - What? - Will we be able to control ourselves? What if we don't want an increase in our sexual, whatever you call it? - Libido. - Would, speak up!. Is that a dance? - Your sex drive. - Oh. - I don't drive. - Kilnerry would be like Sodom and Gomorrah and there's nothing we can do about it. - Oh, now you must be outta your damn mind. I mean, look at us. I mean, most of us in this town are elderly, I haven't had an, an erection for 20 years. Something like this would kill me. - All right, let's not panic. - Wait. Do we not get a say in this? - They started making us use that P172 yesterday. - What? Why didn't you tell us before you went to our plant and poisoned us with your dirty sex fluids? - Cause they knew that we would try and stop them. - Listen everyone, my agency doesn't have the power to even enforce any of this. My agency has hardly any power at all these days. And I was, I was, I was forced to come here and, and to try to sell you guys on this whole thing. I was told it was for the greater good. - Greater good? What about our greater good? - Hey, is this gonna affect the animals too? Cause when I was a little boy, a great dane tried to get physically intimate with me against my will. Ha ha yeah, yeah. Laugh it up, Cooper. - You two cut it out. - Hey, hey, does this thing affect just heterosexuals or does it cause gayness too? - Gayness? - Yeah. Yeah, ain't no gays in this town, buddy. And we like to keep it that way. Am I right? - I'm okay with the gays. - Who said that? Gross. - I know that this must all be really hard for some of you to-- - No, no, no you don't. They probably had a good laugh at all us elderly folks out here in the country, losing our inhibitions, gyrating around town, rubbing up against one another. - Oh. - And you, you knew about this for weeks, did you. And you helped them! - I have never seen this man in my life. This is the first I've heard anything of this. - Liar. You just said-- - Shut it, Wesley. - We'll get the media involved. - Let's not think about that right now. - When I was a young man, you put me in a room with anything, anything. And I'd hump it. Yeah. - Dad, come on. Mr. Nibhanupudi, you said that it took decades for there to be a buildup of this alkaline stuff. Wouldn't it be safe to say that it would take just as long for this P172 chemical as well, and by then you should have a solution for it, right? - No, the rats were actually affected by the P172 almost immediately. (audience gasping) It was impressive, really. There was this one rat that just started fornicating with this other rat until it died. (gasping) It just kept going and going. Just fornicating even post death. Just, it was an angry, it was hateful. It was angry, hateful animal-- - Thank you, Mr. Nibhanupudi. Well. - This is awesome. - This is not awesome. Rat rape? - Well, if there's nothing else, why don't we adjourn tonight's meeting. Oh, well we, we sure could all use a good stiff drink right about now. Why don't we all head over to the pub? I've got drink specials until 10 o'clock Yeah. We're all gonna head over to the pub. Yeah. - Listen up. You have my word, I'm gonna look into this. - Since the Gazette is gone, I'll keep everybody informed. - Mr. Kerry, I've looked after this town for 15 years. I'll keep this town informed. - You don't get the gossip like I do. - Thanks sheriff. - Dad, come on, I'll drive you to the pu - Aednat's still passed out, you idiot. - Oh Jesus. Watch out, watch out. Aednat, sweetie. - Ah. - Come on. - Ah. They're trying to pork me. - [Gary] No, no porking. - Don't let them pork me. - Stop saying pork. She's fine. Yeah. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's me. It's okay, let me drive you home. Come on. Come on dad. It's okay. Father, you coming? - I'll be along shortly. I need to clean up and have a moment of reflection with the Lord. (soft music) - Let's go. - You're late. - You got somewhere to be? - We only got the gym a half an hour. I want to get this over with. - Oh, well then Wesley, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. Yeah. Oh, oh yeah. Oh, huh. Oh I can do that too. How's that, huh? Huh? - You want some of this? - What's that? Oh yeah. Well I got, I got some of that thunder too, huh. - Are you guys serious right now? (upbeat music) - Not too bad, am I? - You hit me in the ear! - No. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Oh, he hit me in tit. - All right, all right, all right. - Oh. ♪ Shining on through the night ♪ (grunting) (groaning) - Get back here.

Well Dorene Tanley will be the first one to keel over in our town from over sexin I'm always over sexing. I just can't find a man to keep up with me. - Ms. Kerry. - Oh, I have to go Marina. I'll call you back later. Bye. What are you all cleaned up today for? - I've cleaned up before. Don't mean nothing. - Hey Mr. O'Reilly. - Oh, hi, Stevie. What are you doing here? - Stevie's helping me unload my car. I had to get up at four this morning. Drive all the way into the city to get supplies, drive all the way back. I don't know what I'm gonna do when Stevie leaves town. - Well, Mr. O'Reilly can help you out. - I'm an old man, Stevie. This may not mean much to you, but if I do a handstand, I can tee bag myself. - All right. Young Stevie does not need to be hearing about your saggy bits. You know, he has a point though. You must walk, what, 10 to 15 miles a day. - 12.3 miles. Yeah. I used to be pretty fit. - Hmm? Football? - Dancer. - Dancer? - Yeah. (laughs) - I just, I don't believe it. - I was a very good dancer. I won the county finals in 1978. Well, after Dora died, I, I didn't feel much like dancing anymore. - Have you been to Aednat's yet today? - Digging for gossip again, huh? - I don't gossip, Fergal. I just happen to know things and people just happen to be interested in the things I know. Come on, tell me. - I dropped by early to deliver her mail, but she barricaded herself inside. Reciting the Lord's prayer. I think she thinks perverts are attacking her. - She thinks pretty much of herself. - Yeah. Duty calls. - Always such a gray skies. No wonder this town is so sour. - You know, my science teacher says since we don't get enough sunlight, we don't get enough UV rays. - Really? - They increase vitamin D and serotonin, which actually helps with depression. In some places like Alaska and Iceland, they use tanning beds to make up for it. - Very interesting. - You know, if you actually had a tanning bed set up here, you'd make a lot of money. - Okay, we'll take care of it. Hey sheriff, Judy Davenport just called. Somebody stole the gnomes out of her front yard. - I'm sure it's just a couple of kids. - I don't know, she seemed upset to me. - Okay. I'll go talk to her. (soft music) - Hi. - Hello. (soft music) - Jerry? (groaning) Jerry? (soft music) - [Jerry] Oh yeah, you dirty little-- - Jerry, are you in there? - Holy Christ! I'll be right out. - Okay. (soft music) - [Jerry] Nessa. - Who were you on the phone with? - No one, no one. what are you doing here? - You know, just sitting over in my shop Just sitting. No one's buying anything. Everyone's shopping online. I don't know how much longer I can stay open. - I'm sure it can't be that bad. - Jerry, this town is dying. - This town is not dying. - Well, businesses are closing and no one's having babies. - Well, most of the people in this town are too all to be having babies. - And Brigid told me Mary Hughes died last night. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - I know. And there's gonna be a wake. - We can order a bouquet with, with the pride of Kilnerry. - That's nice. And all the kids are leaving. So there's that. - I see. Stevie's leaving soon for college. - Yeah. Maybe I can move in with him. You know, go where he goes. - Nessa. Kilnerry's been around a long time. It's quiet here, just the way we like it. No one even locks their doors. You wanna go off to the big city with crime and concrete and pollution and tight jeans. Who wears their jeans so tight with their private parts pressed up against the front of you? It's like an advertisement for disappointment. - What? - No, now we are going to stay in Kilner where we belong. Now, excuse me, I, I need to finish cleaning the bathroom. - Oh, okay. - Okay. Huh, oh, oh now. Okay. Hello? Are you still there? Well, listen, I'll, I'll call back another time. Great. You, you were terrific. Thank you. Great. That only cost me 9.99 a minute. - [Rory] Hey Sheriff. - What's up, Roy? - [Rory] Nothing. Where are you? - I'm out at Deerman Road. - [Rory] What are you doing all the way out there? - Rory, hold on for a second. - [Rory] Sheriff, I'm really lonely. - [Woman] I'm out here. - [Man] I'm getting it. - [Woman] Yeah. - [Man] Am I getting it? - [Woman] You are. - Hey, stop! (soft music) - James, I'm sorry for your loss. Your aunt was a wonderful woman. - I guess. (group chatter) - Who ordered the flower arrangement? - Oh yeah, that was the mayor. Figured he'd do something nice. I guess. - What in the hell? Goddammit! Sorry for your loss, James. - I can do this, I can do this, I can do this. I can't do it, nope. I can't do it. - That girl is not all there. - Need I remind you what she's been through. - No, of course not. - Her father was a good man. Her mother was a saint. - Maybe she needs a good husband. James. - No, she's crazy. - After her parents died, she spent all her time taking care of Stevie. I guess she never found time to date. - What about Gary? - He likes her, sure. But good luck trying to make that boy date. - How long did you know Mary? - 19 Years, seven months, three days. - To Mary! - [Woman] Sorry. - You are a Muppet. - A Muppet? Admit it, Wesley, it's true what they say about priests and little boys. (laughs) - Spawn of Satan! (yelling) - Jerry! Jerry. Oh, Jerry. - Jesus, Jerry, you okay? - He probably had a stroke. - A stroke? What the hell's wrong with you guys? - He knows. - Keep your voice down. - It's because of him. - Gary, hi, Gary. - Nessa. - Gary. - Sheriff O'Reilly. Any hardened criminals today? - I had to arrest Peter and Lisa Donahue - What? What for? - Public lewdness. I caught him fornicating behind a building on Deerman Road. - There's nothing out on Deerman Road. - So what happened to Peter and Lisa? - I tried to stop them, but they just kept going. Peter had this worried look on his face. - So, what did you do? Stand there and watch 'em until they finished. - No. I thought someone might see them. So I tried to hide them, but then I just realized I was being an accessory. - An accessory at a public lewdness? - That's not a thing. - Maybe they, they held Peter's hips and help them go in and out. - Oh, you know, being a sexual voyeur is a pretty common thing these days. If that's your thing Gary, embrace it. - I am not a sexual voyeur. - [Fergal] That'd explain a lot. - Dad. - I still love you, son. - Dammit, I'm not a voyeur. - The man who watches us all. To Gary! - [Group] To Gary! - Oh, poor Mary. She was always such a sweetheart. - She's outta the house. Aednat, it's good to see you. - I convinced Aednat that nobody was going to attack her. And that this whole P172 thing was blown way out of proportion and that she should come and pay her respects to Mary. - You looked so nice. - Once I convinced her to come here, then I talked to taking dance lessons with me. - Oh really? - We're gonna go to the next county where they have a dance studio and we're going to learn the tango. - That would be lovely. - The Tango's a little risque, isn't it? - Gary, we're fine. - Gary arrested the Donahues today. - What? - Fergal, shut up. - What for? - Aednat doesn't need to hear this. - Yes she does. - Gary. - Okay, they were having sex behind the building on Deerman Road. - What were you doing on Deerman Road? - They couldn't control themselves. He tried to stop them, but they were still going. - I knew it. It's that P172, Brigid. Take me home. I, I can't stay. They'll gang bang me. I'm gonna burn in hell, Father. - You're not gonna burn in hell, Aednat. Just calm down. (sobbing) - Aednat. Aednat. - I didn't have a choice. I tried everything. They wouldn't stop. - [Aednat] Oh. - Maybe it is in the water. - What did you do to Lisa and Peter? - [Gary] I pepper sprayed them. - [Aednat] Oh. - [Gary] They were screaming and flailing around. They were blind and so they tried to run I thought they might hurt themselves, so I tackled them. - Oh. Well what did they say? - They said, ah! (yelling) - Excuse me, princess. - Princess! (yelling) - Oh, that P172! (sobbing) - Don't worry, it's okay. You're okay. - Seems like things are really starting to a kick up around here. - I can't imagine how bad Peter and Lisa must feel. - Gary, you should let them out. - They were fornicating in public. There's schools in this town. - He's right. - Just imagine what it's like to be young and in love up against a wall, lost in a moment of carnal lost. - Gary, I want you to go down to the jail and let them out. - What? That's not gonna happen. - Son. You only got one jail cell. They're probably down there having sex in the jail right now. - No. (lively music) (siren blaring) (lively music) - Hey Sheriff, I let them out already. - What? - Your dad called. So. - Go home Rory. (soft music) - How is it you're single, Brigid? You're funny. You're gorgeous. You're confident. You're everything a man could want. - Nobody's ever called me those before. I don't know. I guess I just haven't met the right man yet. How about you? - Oh, I, I've got plenty of options. I'm just extremely picky. - Of course. I was married once. Miserable son of a bitch liked to drink, gambled all my money away. The real straw that broke the camel's ba was when he slept with a woman nicknamed the goat. - Charming. - [Brigid] Didn't even divorce him. - Well, my wife cheated on me too. - Sorry. - Yeah, she met a group of musicians playing in the town fair. She slept with every member of that band She left town about five years ago. - What was the band called? - Lost children. She had me film them in their little vagabond outfits. Horrible name, horrible band. Eh, good riddance. I never filed for a divorce either. - It's nice to talk to someone who understands. Any girl in this town would be lucky to have you. (soft music) - I have had my eye on somebody else quite a while. - Mayor Boylan. Now you don't know what you're getting yourself into. - Call me Jerry. - Jerry. Just shut up and take me. - Don't expect anything fancy. - Yeah. Just tear away the cobwebs and hit this. - Oh. - Jerry! - Oh, call me Mr. Mayor. - Oh, Mr. Mayor, be rough with me. - Oh. (lively music) (phone ringing) - Hello. What, they're stolen again? Hold on for a second. (lively music) - That'll do. - Where's he going? He doesn't have any traps. - He don't fish. - [Peter] Why's he got a boat? - Every night he gets out past the break where he thinks nobody can see him and he dances. - Is he any good? - Shit no. But every time he does that, crazy light housekeeper watches him. Finish 'em up now. - What am I doing? I'm a married man. (soft music) You're gonna make me go see him, aren't you. You don't play fair either. (soft music) - Bless me, father for I have sinned. It has been two years since my last confession. - What troubles you, my child? - I may have committed adultery. - What do you mean, you don't know? - No. - How could you not know? - I don't know where he is. - Does he know where he is? - Why wouldn't he know where he is? - Is that why you committed adultery to draw him out? - Well he's not hiding in the bushes. - Where is he hiding? - I dunno that he is. - Then why would you commit adultery? - I don't know that I did. (knocking on door) - One second. - Forgive me, father for I might have sinned. - I'm sorry, that booth was meant to be locked. I'm with some at the moment. - In there? - No, in the other booth, can you come around the other side and wait. - Father, please, this is important. - Okay, okay. How long since your last confession? - Yeah, a long time. - I see, what is it? - Yeah, I think I'm, I might have committed a adultery. - You don't know either? - What do you mean either? - Hold on. Please continue. - Well, when I left my husband, I packed up everything we owned and I grabbed whatever money I could and I moved here. - So you've committed theft as well. - Well, I never really thought about it that way before. - Why did you leave your husband? - He was a drunk, a gambler and he slept with the goat. - I need a minute. Did you leave your wife before you commit adultery? - Yes. Is that better for me? - It depends, why'd you leave her? - She was having sex with lost children. - Did you participate in these disgusting acts? - No! I mean, no. All I did was photograph them in their little outfits. I wasn't around for the sex. - [Father O'Dell] You did what? - They had a fog machine and a light sho It was rather impressive. - You stay right there. - Are you still there, my child? - Yes. - Yes. - The church has gotten very relaxed over the years. I don't think it's as big a deal as you might think. - Oh well that's great. - It's not you. You and your wife are definitely going to hell. - Ex-wife and all I did was make the introductions and film them. I'm innocent. - On your way out, splash some holy water on your face. If you don't burst into flames, do a thousand to hail Mary's. - And a thousand hail? - As I was saying, you can't be held accountable for your husband's transgressions. - Amen. Hail Mary full of grace. The lord is with the. Blessed art thou amongst women blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, Holy Mary. - If he was a threat to himself and you, it only makes sense that you would flee in search of a more wholesome life. While fornicating out of wedlock is frowned upon by the church, it's hardly anything that would have an eternal effect on your soul. - Thank God. - Can I confess something to you? - Sure. - Lately I've been struggling with something in my own life and whether it would be acceptable with the modern church and its relaxed views on social norms. - I'm all ears, father. - When Adam and Eve were originally put on earth by God, they were put here in the nude. Clothed and unclothed meant nothing to them. It wasn't until Eve ate the forbidden fruit that sin was created. In an attempt to cover their spiritual shame, they covered their bodies. As God's children, we live with a great deal of shame and cover who we really are. Can you imagine if we could shed that shame to be closer to God? - I'm afraid I'm not quite following your father. - Don't worry about it. All I'm trying to say is try not to be too hard on yourself for finding love again. (scoffing) - It's a little early to call it love. It's just sex. I mean, should I say a thousand hail Marys too? - How about five hail Marys and a high five? - Deal. - Watch the back, watch the back. How's it coming along? - Good. Trying to get these outputs lined up. - That's good. Let's keep up the good work. - It's okay. I like it. - You do? - Yeah. - You know, I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for that P172 though, right - Thank God for P172. (soft music) - You give me too much credit if you think I'd be any harm. - I suppose you're right. - I, I just came by to give you your mail and to check on you. - That's very sweet. I don't suppose you'd care to come in for a cup of tea. - I'd like that. (soft music) - This doesn't seem right. I must be doing something. Oh. Okay. Breathe. Hey Gary. Hi Gary, it's Nessa. He knows your name. What are doing? No. Act relaxed and calm. Breathe. What are you doing here? - I just need some paper for down at the station. - Right, paper, paper, 'cause it's a paper store. What is your poison? Ink jet or all purpose? - All purpose is fine. - Ultra bright or regular? - Whatever's cheaper. - Okay. That'll be $6, sir. Any hot bed activity today? - You don't want to know. - Oh, okay. - Have a good day. - You too. Gary, wait. I forgot you are my 100th customer and you, you get a free group of pens. Yes. - What color? Black or blue? Now I recommend choosing blue because it shows people that you care enough to give them an original and that you like them unless they want a copy and then it would come back black anyway But I really do think that blue shows that people, you know care. Do you care, Gary? You care, don't you? Which color? Black or blue or blue or black? - I pick blue. - Ah, I knew you'd like blue. You also get this. - Kittens? - Yeah. For when you're lonely. Meow. Oh, and also I need to take a picture for my website. - You have a website? - I do. Ready. One, two, three. Sorry. - Nessa. Come on, I'm still at work. - Gary, why don't you like me? - What? - I know. I am, I'm socially awkward and I'm not as pretty as other girls, but why? I mean I'm all right, aren't I? - Yeah. I mean, yeah, I just, I just don't date. - Now it makes sense. Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't see this before. Of course you wouldn't want people to kn you were an officer of the law. Does your, does your, does your dad know - Does my dad know what? - That you like to have sex with other men. - Wait, what? - I can't believe I've been throwing myself at you, and your probably like ugh, Nessa, vaginas gross. Not the mine's gross. It's actually quite lovely. You know what? Now we can be best friends. I can be your Grace. I love that show, "Will and Grace". Talk about waxin' private parts and boys And well, I wax my private parts. It's very important apparently, you know if opportunity comes a knocking. And actually in the gay community, you know, manscaping, it's something that really matters. So I can show you how. - Nessa, Nessa, I'm not gay. - So I don't get to be your Grace. - No. - This is embarrassing. You probably think I'm cookoo. (chuckling) - Well, I don't think you're dangerous. - It's probably the chemical plant. Yeah. That's making me like act like this. - I think everyone's taking P172 a little too far. - No, because the lot of people in this town are on this dating site. - You're on a dating site? - Yes. Nancy Owen said she got a picture of a guy's penis. - What? - Yeah. It happens a lot, I guess. - Does that work? - I mean, yeah, if you like the guy. If not, then no. - Do girls send pictures? - Oh my God. No, it doesn't photograph well. Not that I try. - [Gary] The site needs to be shut down. - [Nessa] Why? - Nessa, lewdness and pornography is not an improvement on this town. - You're so handsome. - What? - I was asking if yoga is too lewd. - Yoga? - Oh yeah. You know the, the thing where people wear skimpy outfi and they do bendy positions. Are you okay? I got a book. I, I got a book and I think that it would be good for the town. Yes. Good for the town, you know, to get-- - That's a terrible idea. - People loosen up and, and work on their core. - Nessa. - And I mean, I really do think it would be a good idea. It'll bring lots-- - What would your parents think? - Why would you bring them into? - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - You know what, Gary, get out. Give me the kitten calendar, Gary why didn't you ask me why I don't date? - What? - You think I don't wanna be loved and kissed and touched. I do. I want that so badly. And you know how hard it is to lose both your parents and have to raise your kid brother on your own? - No. I think you're very pretty. But I. (soft music) I should go.

Yeah, of course the mind slows down and then the body follows and well, then the mind tells you you're old. Yeah. Can I ask you something? - Sure. - What was all that, was all that sexual stuff back at Mary's wake before you were running out? - Well, I was a little wilder when I was younger You won't tell anybody will you? - Oh no. - That hasn't been me for a long time. And, and now I'm dancing again after 10 years. I've got an idea for something a little more sultry. How adventurous are you feeling? - Oh, I'm, I'm open for new things. - Good, I'll be right back.

I'm not as flexible as I used to be. - You and me both, baby. - These were always great dance moves. - What? - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm stretching. Yeah, you know, you can't stretch with your clothes on. Yeah, you might rip the crotch out and I don't wanna do that. Yeah, I mean, nothing against doing that but you should try stretching. It's always, it's always something that helps you, particularly when you, when you get to be your age. You gotta keep moving. You gotta keep stretching. There. Now, let's have a look at that book. - Oh, it's, it's Noal's old dance book from the 90s. He was a wonderful dancer. Much better than I ever was. - Oh. No, I, I don't really, I don't think I could do this, Aednat. I mean, I, I've never done anything like this before, just, just basic dance moves. I mean like what's the human propeller? - Oh, that was Noal's favorite. - Oh yeah, well, all right, well, let's, let's have a look at it. Yeah. The, the woman takes the first position on the ground with her legs behind her head. Oh. And the man lays perpendicular to the floor, stiff as a board with his hips balanced on her bottom and rotates 360 degrees. - Well, we don't have to do these moves. We can mix it up, but we can do tango or, or Foxtrot. We can learn it together. We're not dead yet, Fergal. - Yeah. - What have we got to lose? - Look, I, I just didn't expect this. You, you, you seem so quiet. - Well I, I like being with you and I, I guess this P172 and, and all this it's, it's making me feel like my old self again. - Yeah.

Gary, sit down. Brigid, honey, do you have any coffee or tea? - [Brigid] Sure. - Gary, we've known each other for the better part of 10 years. It's a long time. Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Jerry, if you have something to say to me, then say it. - Gary, in all that time I, I have never seen you go out on a date. You've never had a girlfriend. - Eric and James have come out. They're walking around town holding hand It is so adorable. - The job comes first now more than ever - But this town is better than it's ever been. - Better? Are you blind. - Gary, why didn't you ask Nessa out? Everybody knows she's attracted to you. I don't know why. - Well, even your father is dating. - What? Who? - He's been giving Aednat dancing lessons for weeks. They've been spending a lot of time together, if you know what I mean. - That doesn't mean that they're dating or that they're doing that. Jerry, this proposal-- - Don't you miss love, Gary? - Stay outta this, Brigid. - Don't bark at me in my own store. - This is why I came her. - I suppose you don't miss sex either. - Brigid, don't-- - You've overstepped your bounds, Ms. Kerry. - Oh, come on now. - I'm a man of honor. - [Brigid] No, you are not. - I'm a man of honor who cares more about this town than the town gossip. - You are a control freak and a bully. - Do you wanna talk about real solutions or do you wanna fail this town and just dance all day? - Now you've overstepped your bounds. - Jerry, if you don't wanna impose a curfew for anyone under 18,, I can't be held responsible when there's a hospital full of teen pregnancies. - That's the way it was when I was growing up. Maybe that's what this town needs. - You're insane. I'm not giving up on this, Jerry. - I wish I had a baby. It would've filled a void in my life. - Police force. - In your life. - Your fault. If you don't wanna rally behind saving this town, then maybe I should find some residents who will find a mayor who will. - Control yourself, man. Who do you think you are? - I'm the law. - Yes. Yes. You are a law enforcement officer, not a law maker. That son is far above your pay grade. Now I don't know what's happening with you. Gary O'Reilly, stop.

I'm gonna pick up some things and then I'm going over to Nessa's. I have to take her this plant. - Why? - It's the anniversary of her parents passing, the car crash. - That's right. - It's called spathiphyllum.

I've got five other police departments in the county who have agreed to buy their office supplies from Nessa Ward. So this is really gonna help her out.

(soft music) - [Brigid] So, the man from the EPA is going to pay us another visit. - Why? - Yeah, we got a big success story here. We're in the Times. - Good evening everyone. - Hi, father. - Ah, Jerry, get the father a beer. - [Jerry] I'm busy. - Jerry. - I'll have a pint, barman. - You do it. - I don't know how. - Fine. I'll do it. - Hey Gary, how's it going? You're not still sore with me, are ya? I'm wearing clothes today. - Why wouldn't you be wearing clothes? - It's a long story. This tastes flat. - I've never served a flat beer in my life. You wanna punch in a face? - Always violence with you, isn't it me. - Me? Well, you are no saint. - Wait, wait, wait, who's violent? - This one here. - Who did you beat up? - No one. - Repent, sinner. - Don't try to intimidate me with religion. - Son, you wanna jump in here? - Nope. - This man would come into church every Sunday and steal holy water and take it back to his bar and put it in his Shepherd's pies and call them Christ's pies. - Well, he would park in my space at the office and walk three blocks to the church. You have a whole damn parking lot. - I've been upset with you for 15 years for roughing up my sister. - What? - Is that true? - I have no idea what he's talking about What an earth are you talking about? - It's true. I was in high school and you picked up my older sister for a date on your motorcycle. She always thought it was so cool to go out with a much older guy who had a motorcycle. - She was in her 20s. Let's not make it could sound like I was dating children. - This hooligan picked her up, took her out and later that night she came home with bruises all over. She refused to tell anyone what happened I swore revenge on you that night for life. - I never touched your sister. (yelling) - [Woman] Stop it. - We were riding home down Carigore Road And I looked back to talk to her and she was gone. I had stopped at a few intersections and I, I just assumed she jumped off. She never called me that night. I was devastated. - You didn't notice when she let go. - She was holding onto the back of her seat. - See, so maybe when, when she got off, someone else roughed her up. - And, is that the same Corigan Road that used to have all those old pot hole - Oh dear God. She must have bounced right off the back - How could you not have noticed? - I was facing forward. I'm not a damn stunt driver. - I didn't know you had a motorcycle. - She must have tumbled right down the hill and I just kept going. I thought for sure, I was gonna get laid that night. - Animal! That's my sister! - It didn't happen, did it? - See, he never touched your sister. It was an accident. - And you've had, you've had this grudge for 15 years. ♪ We are the one ♪ (laughs) - Take him. - What the? - Hit him. You can hit him. (yelling) - [Woman] What is the matter with you? - [Jerry] What is the matter with you? - I just drank the water. - So? - So I'm infected just like all of you. - Infected? - The one thing we could count in this town was that these two would always be fighting and now that's is gonna change too. You people don't get it. P172 has ruined this town. Look at you. You've changed. You've all changed. - I haven't. I'm still the same. - You. You're the worst out of all of them. You and your yoga nonsense. I can't stop thinking about you in your sexual provocative positions. It's not normal. You're disgracing yourself and everyone in this town. - Gary. - Your parents would be ashamed of you. - Hey enough! (soft music) Oh, you're a real horses ass. Come on, Aednat. We've got a competition to go to. Yeah, that's right. A dance competition. - I'll drive you. (soft music) - Hey. - Well. - You know, sheriff, you've been so busy playing dictator to everyone in this town that you to realize that we don't need you anymore. There's no crime in Kilnerry except for police harassment. And I for one am going to call the governor's office first thing in the morning to lodge a complaint and maybe it's time for the people of this town to petition for a new sheriff. - Maybe you should go, son.

And before she, she was sick, you saved money to go backpacking across Europe, wanted to be an architect. - Well, I had to stay here and take care of you. - Don't you put that on me. You just, you stopped living. Why? Just because you're wanted to save her. - I was just some dumb kid. What did I know? - No, you weren't. You're the bravest kid I know. You just gave up.

Welcome to another quarterly town hall meeting in lovely Kilnerry. There have been a lot of exciting change since our last meeting, yeah. (audience applauds) Oh, I see some new smiling faces. The, the, the gray clouds are parted and it's gonna be a beautiful summer and we're booming now baby! (audience applauds) Now, as you know, my dear friend Rakesh from the Environmental Protection Agency has come back to speak to us. He says he has some good news for us. Let's bring him up. - [Woman] Yay! (audience applauds) - Wow. Thank you. This is a pretty different welcome compared to the last time I was here, right? Thank you all for being so, so gracious. I've been reading about you guys in the Times. And Jerry has told me about all the amazing things that have been happening here. And gosh, I, I gotta admit I was not excited to come here that first time when I had to break the news about the potential side effects of P172 which is why I am so excited to be back here now, to tell you. - What did I miss? - Well, the rats that we got for the original-- - Don't shush me. I shush you. - Right, so what I had to say was I'm excited to tell you-- - I shush you. That's what I do. (shushing) I shush you! - Wow. I really missed you guys. So anyways, the rats that we conducted the original P172 study on, they were all contaminated before we got them. They were in another department being tested on pheromones. - Does that mean we're not helping the environment? - No, you are helping the environment. I'm just saying that P172 has no side effects. - But I was out of control. - Just look outside and you'll see that the animals are not fornicating each other to death. They, they're acting completely normal. - I shush you. - Not now darling. None of this is real. P172 is fake. All those things we did, we did on our own. Oh, I feel so ashamed. - I think I'm going to be sick. - We mortgaged the house to build a dungeon, all the leather toys and butt plugs. - Look, I know this is hitting all hard now-- - Shut up, Gary. It isn't about you right now. I'm going to hell. - You damn sons of bitches. We must be a laughing stock to you. You and the whole lot of you back in Washington, laughing at us. Yeah, thinking we're we're under some, some goddamn spell. - [Brigid] We'll sue them. - No, I would not suggest that these private companies have millions that they put into lobbyin and they have politicians in their pockets. They have teams of lawyers that could bankrupt this entire town. Things are just not the way they used to be. - We were in the Times on the internet. - I just think-- - My face is the face they're going to show when they talk about what fools we've been. - Everyone, please. - Not now, Gary. You've got the rest of your life to rub our noses in this. - I don't wanna-- - I'm not sorry for any of it. - What? - I'm not sorry for any of it. I'm not. - What do you mean? - P172 or not, I love you. I am a fool. And now the world knows. I don't care. All I care is about you, Brigid love. - Oh Jerry. - Listen, everybody. However you're feeling right now, just give it some time. It'll blow over. - Blow over. Some of us have a lot more years behind us than ahead of us. Oh, well for some of us, it's a dying legacy being a punch line. - Let's calm down and remember we're in the house of the Lord. We're all responsible for our own action No one in this room is being judged. Only God can do that. No one here acted out to spite God. You all acted in a manner that made you happy or made you express love. For some fornicating was a way of breaking down walls and allowing yourself to feel love again I too had to come to terms with wanting to be closer to God in the image that he made me, which is why I have become a nudist. (crowd gasping) - Okay, it was great to see you guys again. Have a good one. - It's not sexual. It's not sinful. It's just the way God made me. You all inspired this courageous leap. - Nice penis, Wesley. - [Eric] Hey. - Babe, I'm just looking. Just looking. - I have something to add here too. It wasn't too long ago that I was pretty lonely. We'd pass one another and say hi, but otherwise we wouldn't bother one another. And these last three months, there's not a day that's gone by that not one of you hasn't been part of my life. I've never felt so loved. And I will, I will not let anyone cheapen that or shame the people that I love and respect. (soft music) - I was wrong, dad. I was wrong. Let me ask you people something. Have I ever been unfair? By the constraints of the law, have I ever been unfair? Blake? Margaret? Anyone? I just always knew what to expect from this town. I protect the people I love. Even when that means pointing out when I think you're doing things against your better judgment. - That's not for you to decide. Oh, I know you look at me and you see an old woman. Well, I can't help these wrinkles or that I move a little slower. Inside, I'm the same woman I was before you were born. - Just let me finish. I. I was just trying to. You gotta know that it came from a right place. No matter how misguided it was, maybe I was a horse's ass. You, you people have no idea how important you are to me. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna stop upholding the law either. But I will try and be a better friend. - I don't accept your apology, Sheriff O'Reilly. You don't just get to say you're sorry and expect everything to be fine. You hurt people. And some cuts are deeper than others. And we just got some very shocking news yet again, and you're making it about you. So I am gonna go home and I am gonna think about how this makes me feel. And I will not be thinking about you or your rock hard body. I said it out loud. (soft music) - If there's nothing else, let's call it a night. As always, the bar is open, but whatever you decide to do, please be safe. - Hey Gary. How'd you like those gnomes I left in your front yard? (lively music) - I'm proud of you son. Come on. I'll buy you a pint. (lively music) - And you promise me that you are gonna call me, give your room number so I can send you a surprise. - Yes. Yes sis, I'll text you everything. I thought they sell supplies there. - I wanna be able to send you highlighters and pens. And do you need protractor? - [Stevie] What? (chattering) - What are you looking for? - Sheriff O'Reilly. - Why are you looking for him? - Well, he said that he would say goodbye to me before I left. And I haven't really seen him all week. - I wouldn't expect too much from him. - Look, he's not a bad guy. You just gotta give him a chance. - Stevie please-- - Look, he really likes, you. - No, he doesn't. - But he's a great guy-- - Stevie, stop, stop. - Give him a chance. - Stop. Just stop. I'm gonna be alone and that's fine. - Look, I'll come over for summer and holidays and I'll talk to you on the phone all the time, okay. (horn honking) Okay, I got, I gotta go. Okay, I love you sis. - I love you too. (soft music) Mom and dad would be really proud. - Hey, what's up. (group chatter) - What's up, man? - Hey. How's it going? (group chatter) Hey, Sheriff O'Reilly. Hey. Just give me one second, one second. I'm gonna go grab Nessa. She's on the other side, okay. Hold on. Hey, he's on the other side. - What are you? - Just talk to him. - Are you okay? What? Wait, Stevie. Just call me later. (soft music) - You just missed him. - Actually, we saw each other through the window. We, we set our goodbyes. I thought I'd come by-- - I have dates. I mean, I have to go on a date. - Oh. - Yes. I signed up for that dating app. - Congratulations. - Thank you, I've moved on and I have a lot of men that are sending me picture of their dicks. Dick pics. Little dicks, big dicks, all kinds of dicks-- - Nessa-- - Why would you say those things to me? - You know why. - No. You're an awful person. - It's not because I meant them. It's 'cause I was trying to hurt you. - Why would you wanna hurt me? - Because you terrify me. Why do I terrify you? - Because I'm absolutely in every possible way in love with you. - What? - You don't terrify me anymore. (soft music) - I terrify you? - Uh huh. There's one more thing. - What? - I think I'm gonna open up a dance studio. - [Nessa] What do you know about dance? - Mom and dad might have showed me one or two things and there might be room enough for your yoga studio. - Well, Sheriff O'Reilly, I don't know what to say. So you love me, huh? - [Gary] You making fun of me? - [Nessa] No, you got moves. Moves, moves, moves. - [Gary] You wanna see some moves, come here.
