Relax your waist. Relax your arm. Kim So Hee. Start the music. Okay. Get ready. Look at the front. Yay! Thank you. Don't run too fast. What if we get caught? It's not our major subject anyway. What if she tells to Mun-jung? Then, tell her you followed me to the hospital. It doesn't make sense. Why not? You're the one who wanted to see the concert. What are you so worried about? - Darn it. - Hey, are you following me? - No. - I know you're coming behind me. Hey, you two. Hey. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, dear Hae Ju. Happy birthday. No. I don't want to get fat. It's just for today. My favorite cream cake. Hye Ju, happy birthday. This is for you. What are you doing? What are you hiding? Is today your birthday? Did you eat all the cake? That's why you're fat. Look in the mirror. You're so fat. By the way, since when were you here? Let's use this place together. Can't you smell something in here? It smells like a pig. Are you getting ready for the exhibit? This is the fox's stairs. It grants us any wish. It's pathetic. It's true that if the 29th stair appears, it will grant our wish. Do you believe that? Why? Nobody knows. The fox might grant us wish. What is your wish? You want to become a famous ballerina? All I need is you. What the… It's my mom. You're dead. Go home. - Go home. - Go home. Fast. See you tomorrow. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28. Kim So Hee, thank you for the concert. I love you. Do you have gym clothes? - No. - Darn it… You should bring your own gym clothes. Okay. Hey, you should wash this. Hey, I told you. No, she's lying. You're lying, right? I told you. Do you want to die? Who are you looking for? Even though it won't fit me, What? since my next class is P.E… Do you need gym clothes? Take mine. It's cute. One. Two. Three. Four. One, two, three, four. Her pants are about to burst. There are diet pills nowadays. Stop it. Hey, your pants got ripped. Can't you girls run properly? Organize the formation. One, time. Hello. Hello. You should always tie your hair. Yoon Jin Sung, what's your problem? Who allowed you to skip the class? Have you lost your mind because I always praised you? There are many students who are better than you. What did I say you need the most? Practice. You have to practice because you're not good. It applies to everyone. Excuse me… Ms… What's wrong? Jin Sung didn't want to skip the class. But I just took her with me. Are you guys trying to play with me? So Hee, is your legs okay? Don't you have to go the hospital? - Hello? - Hello? - Where are you? - Hello? Where are you? I'm at the dormitory. What are you doing? - Hello? - Hello? - So Hee, I can't hear you. - Can't you hear me? Hello? - Hello? - I can't hear you. - Hello? - Hello? Jin Sung. Hey. Be quiet. Hey, hold me. - You scared me. - I told you to be quiet. I ran from my house. What have you done? Can I sleep here? Why are you so scared? Oh, my stomach. You know why my mom made me learn ballet? It's because she always wanted to become a ballerina. I want to live somewhere where's no mom and ballet. Let's live together when we become 20 years old. What do you say? Hey, answer me. Okay. It's done. Hey, what is this? I always had a talent as a stylist. - I can't believe it. - Let's take a picture. - No way. - You look beautiful. Look at here. Aren't you bored? Eat some more. I won't abandon you. We're friends forever. You too. Aren't you bored? Eat some more. I won't abandon you. We're friends forever. Aren't you bored? Eat some more. - I won't abandon you. - Fifteen. Sixteen. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Fox, fox, please grant my wish. I want to lose weight. Ta-da. Jin Sung, to be honest, I become so happy when I'm doing ballet. After 10 years, we'll be at London Opera House. I can be Giselle and you can be Albrecht. It'll be awesome, right? I'm going home. See you at the school. Why am I Albrecht? I'll be Giselle. (The 26th Seoul Ballet Competition) Have you seen the notice? Only one student can apply for it. If you become the 1st place, you can be invited to Russia Ballet School. You'll try it, right? Look at this. (The 26th Seoul Ballet Competition) If you do well as Giselle, the 1st place is yours. Can you do it? You need to have good techniques and you have to express many emotions. I know you're good at it. Since you have the fundamentals, I hope you apply for the competition. Okay. Why do you hang around Jin Sung so much? Are your legs okay now? Let's take a look. You lier. Your mom told me you're okay now. How is she? - Fine. - So Hee, give this to your mom. Jin Sung, did I scare you? My Jin Sung. I was looking for you. You should've told me where you're going. Wait a minute. Hello? Yes. Yes, mom. Yes, I'll apply for it. Yes. Hey, you scared me. Why are you laughing? I'm sorry. I look different, right? Yeah, I can't believe it. You lost so much weight. You look pretty now. Did you make this? Is this the fox stairs in front of our dorm? Right? Your wish will be granted when the 29th stair appears. This stairway was the only one who listened to my story. It believed me and it granted my wish. So I believe this stairway. If you wish for something with all your heart, the 29th stair will appear and grant your wish. Do you really believe it? I really wished hard to make me lose weight. Hey, I can't find my toe shoes. Look more closely. Darn it. I can't believe it. We're late. Let's go. Jin Sung, can I borrow your shoes? How can she move like that right after she got okay? She must've been lying about her injury. Poor me… Not all of you can apply to this competition. Only one student can apply for it. It's not my decision. So I'll be holding an audition and choose one student. If you're interested, come visit me or Ms. Kim and tell us. You'll never get better if you're doing like this. Practice hard. This is a very nice chance. So don't lose it. Aren't you guys answering me? Okay. Let's do this. - Okay. - Dismissed. Good job. Hey, the audition is just a trick. They'll make So Hee do Giselle no matter what. If anyone dances as Giselle in the competition, - she'll win the 1st place. - Jin Sung, you should buy a new toe shoes. It's too old. Okay. Ms. - Yes? - Goodbye. Goodbye. I have something to say. Now? Yes. Do you know Giselle is a hard role? I know you want to do it but it requires more than just desire. Do you understand me? See you tomorrow. Hey, lady. Jin Sung! What are you doing here? Let's go and buy a new toe shoes. I'll treat you dinner. Hey, what's wrong with you? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven. Fox, fox. Please grant my wish. Let me go to the competition. Concentrate on your toe. Lower your shoulders. That's right. Straighten your back. Jin Sung, tighten your stomach. Allonge. The fifth. Eyes. So Hee, aren't you coming? - Go first. - Okay. - Goodbye. - Let's go together. Bye. Hey. Hey, Eum Hye Ju. Hye Ju. Stop there. (Jin Sung, do well tomorrow) (Your toe shoes were too old) (From your beloved friend, So Hee) Jin Sung, overe here. Jin Sung. Yun Jin Sung. Leave me alone. Jin Sung, what's wrong with you? Talk to me. Don’t bother me. You're so annoying. Is it because of the competition? Kim So Hee, I really hate you. You make me feel pathetic. If you leave like this, you won't see me again. Jin Sung, all I need is you. Do you know how much I like you? Let me go. (The 26th Seoul Ballet Competition) Next is the 3rd applicant. A second-year student of Young-hwa Art High School. Yun Jin Sung, Giselle. Very very good. Nice job. Excuse me. Yes, how did it go? Ah… - Ah... - What is it? She got the 1st place. - I knew it. - Congratulations. You were so good. You're so beautiful. So Hee, what will we do? It doesn't matter. What do you want me to do? I don't care if I can't do ballet. Mom. Don’t cry. Stop crying. It's my fault. So Hee. Jin Sung. Yun Jin Sung. You left your umbrella. I was worried. Sorry for sending you back home like that. Weren't you cold? So Hee, how did you come here? Are your legs okay? I waited for 3 hours at the hospital today. But then, I suddenly thought that you might refuse to see me again. - And I heard everything... - Jin Sung, congratulations. It's okay. all I need is you. - Jin Sung. - Kim So Hee. Jin Sung, - something bad happened. - Hello? Oh, really? So Hee is dead. - Because her friend betrayed her. - Really? Yun Jin Sung pushed her from the stairs. Oh, my. Jin Sung, are you okay? Ms, So Hee came to my room yesterday. She even slept with me. Jin Sung, how do you feel now? Do I have to change the room? The teachers said it's for your own benefit. Do you get it? Hurry up. Ahn Eun Mi, this bra is yours, right? Mam… - Don't do this next time. - Okay. Hurry up. - What is it? - What is this? Isn't this So Hee's? Why is a dead girl's stuff here? Eun Ju, what is this? Hey, a crazy girl is here. She must be crazy. Is this really yours? If it's really yours, I'll give it back. Give it back to me. I told you we should go to the snack bar. I feel like I've become a sheep. I was so hungry. Hey, - eat mine. - Eat mine too. Do you think I'm a pig? What a freak. It tastes so bad. Why do they always give us grass? - Let's go to the restroom. - Why? The bell rang already. You should go alone. Why are you talking me? I'm so full. Don't run. Look at your belly. It seems that you've gained some weight. Don't you have to lose weight? Really? The others didn't tell me. Did I really gain weight? Maybe not. I guess you were just teasing me. If you go on a diet, you're breasts will become smaller. Then, the guys won't like you. Hey, the breasts will become bigger when the guys touch it. How's Young Tae doing? Hey, didn't I tell you not to talk about him? - Why? - Do you want to die? You're the one who spread the rumor, right? - It wasn't me. - Are you sure? It wasn't me. Don't ever talk about him again. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Fox, fox. Please grant my wish. Bring back So Hee to me. Yun Jin Sung. Yun Jin Sung. Stand still. Sit down fast. Attention. Jin Sung has been invited to Russia Ballet School. It's good for her but also it's good for our school since she raised our school's reputation. What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? Let's give her an applause. Come on. Give her an applause. Clap. (For Eum Hye Ju only) Why do you think you're alone? Like you're the only person in the world. How about expressing your love to your family or your friends first? Those who feel lonely are those who didn't start loving themselves. A true love will get back to us twice more than what we had given to. The world will be bleak if we don't receive it back. If we get ignored after giving love, we don't have to live anymore. If your hair is black, you'll look more beautiful. I wanted to become friends with you. I mean it. I like you so much. Young-sun, that's not it. Raise your legs. Straighten your shoulders. In that way, your legs will look more beautiful. Try it again. Let's try it with the music. Let's stop it for today. No, we only did it twice. Let's just tell her we're done. The audio is broken anyway. On the day of the audition, I saw you changing the toe shoes with So Hee. Why did you do it? Why are you curious about it? What's wrong with this? Hey, turn on the light. I didn't do it. Wait a minute. I told you nothing's wrong. It's not blood. It's just the wind. Don't be scared. Get back to your room. - Teacher. - I'm scared. - I saw a ghost. - There's no ghost. I mean it. Hey! Be quiet! I don't like darkness. Can't you hear something? I can hear something. I mean it. Do you think a black hair will look good on me? I'm not so sure… A stylist? I know you have a talent as a stylist. Is that so? Thank you. Okay. It tickles. Fine, I'll do what you say. Who is it? Who is it? I can't sleep because I can hear something in my room. It feels like someone is knocking my window. Let me sleep in here for today. Don't be ridiculous. It's just the wind. I'm so scared. Don't be scared. We'll get punished if you sleep here. Go to your room. I'm so sorry. - Shall we make a wish? - Okay. - Okay. - I want to have bigger breasts. I want to have a boyfriend. It's impossible with your face. Your wish is ridiculous too. Why not? - It's ridiculous. - Hey, you should go first. I left something. - Okay. See you later. - See you later. - Hurry up. - Okay. Fox, fox. Please grant my wish. I'm telling you again. This work will be serve as your final exam. So if you guys make weird stuff, you'll get a fail grade. - Do you get it? - Yes. Han Yun Ji. Yes? You're bored working with beginners, right? I'm going to check on you later. Do you get it? Okay. You little… Okay, I get it. Hey, Han Yun Ji. I'll do an interview with Han Yun Ji, the greatest artist. Since when did you start doing art? Since the 2nd year in the elementary school. I guess you showed talent. Of course. Congratulations on winning the art competition. What do you want? Didn't I tell you not to show yourself in front of me? You smell so bad. Get out. This isn't your chair. Let me go. Are you crazy? Why are you doing that to Hye Ju? Don't you feel pity for her? I know your wish. Do you want me to grant it for you? That was too harsh. So Hee, you didn't have to do this. Okay, I'll do whatever you say. Don't abandon me. I won't abandon you. I sent the post from Russia to your dorm. Check it later. (The Housemaster Room) Jin Sung, what's wrong? - My post... - Ah, that? I left it in your room. Okay. Teacher? Congratulations. Congratulations on your admission. Are you surprised? I prepared it for you. Because we're friends. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Yun Jin Sung, Goodbye. - Let's go. - Goodbye. (See you at the sculpture room at 7 PM. From So Hee) Hey! Jin Sung, did I scare you? Do you know how sad we're that you're leaving? My Jin Sung, we'll miss you. Jin Sung, I prepared something for you. Wait a minute. Ta-da. Why are you keep doing this to me? Why not? We are friends. How can you say like that? Jin Sung. I'll bear it since I'm pretty. I don't have an opener. Jin Sung, I'll get it fast. Wait here, okay? Jin Sung, So Hee keeps on coming to me. Help me. Please. Help me. Help me. Please. Please. All I need is you. Don't go. Jin Sung. I know you're in here. Even though you pushed me from the stairs, I'm still here. All I need is you. I found you. Eum Hye Ju There's something that you don't know. I didn't push So Hee from the stairs. If you're So Hee, you should already know about this. Eum Hye Ju, you're crazy. Jin Sung. How can you mistake me from that dirty girl? Eum Hye Ju, step aside. Jin Sung. Eum Hye Ju. You're crazy. Eum Hye Ju, move. Eum Hye Ju, please. Please, Eum Hye Ju. Please. Jin Sung. Don't you know who I'm? It's me, So Hee. Jin Sung, don't leave. Please. If you leave like this, you won't see me again. I like you so much. I'm so tired. I won't abandon you. Because we're friends. I guess Jin Sung don't like you. Yun Jin Sung, you can do it. You'll do fine. One, two, three. Please make it go back. Seventeen, eighteen. Twenty… Make it go back. Make it go back! Don't go. Why are you avoiding me? I've been waiting for you in here. Jin Sung, you're all I have. I guess we can't go back now. I'm so scared of leaving you here alone. I'm sorry. I didn't hate you. It was just that… It was just that I wanted to beat you once. It's okay. We're friends. So do you forgive me? Of course. How can I hate you? Jin Sung, but I think you don’t like me as I like you. From now on, don't make me wait for you. Let's stay together forever. One. Two. Three. Four. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven? Twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty eight. That was nothing. The lights go off at 10 PM. After that time, don't go to other rooms. Do you get it? The laundry room is in the basement. If you have a question, ask me or your friends. This room has been empty. So open the window and refresh the room. What is this song? Do I know this song?
