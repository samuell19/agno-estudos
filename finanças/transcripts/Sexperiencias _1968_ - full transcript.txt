I make small monsters in uniforms. I can't get used to walking alone. I'm afraid, you know. My name is Carlos. I come for dinner here every night. I've seen you many times. I've seen you too. With your friends. You have a lot of friends. I can't understand that fear. Just one and he's not here anymore. But he'll come back. Yes...It's going to take him a year and a half. Minus four days. I love him and I promised him to behave well. You can be with anybody and don't behave bad. He wouldn't like that. He told me. He's very jealous. Drink... Drink is not a good partner for easing the fear. Don't you drink? No... My stomach... would protest. And you're always alone. The years... I have many years... I have been jealous too and I end-up alone. Carlos makes engraving. He's almost an artist. Sometimes he makes films... Yes, yes... More or less like now. Come on, dedicate an actor's smile to the public. Come on, Carlos, your smile. How many women have you loved? Say, how many? All of them... How many women have you loved? Hey, Carlos How many? Have many have loved you? Yes... Don't you remember? How many have loved you? Some. Me? Oh sorry. I'll also love Carlos in order to learn his experiences. And some other... Me? You're my wife. Forgotten? No... not forgotten. The first one. We were very young. The only one. Forever. I'll also love Carlos in order to know his experiences. In his fifties...Vegetarian... Everyone who have known him will say that he's a good man. He is. He has suffered a lot, but never expressed it and nobody could tell. Today he would've been the chief engineer of an ocean liner. but he left the navy when they installed a cannon in his ship during the World War. Even though the cannon was never used because Portugal didn't play war either. When he wants to... he makes oil portraits. But he never worked as a painter. He has loved a lot. And he has been requited during long periods of time. But never in same proportion as his dedication, because he has never really been understood. He suffers from injustice but.... he doesn't have the ability to get irritated. He writes poems and he accompanies them with his guitar which was property of a friend. It's very pleasant to hear him sings them. but he has never been able to do it in public. He has read all from Krishnamurti with whom he agrees and he's interested. He has always been interested in Oriental philosophy. He believes in astrology and in friendship. Now he things he could've done a lot of things he didn't do. He is starting to be a little... tired. Tired of disappointments... a little bit frustrated. He believes in hope and he still gets emotional like a teenager. He has believed in God. He stopped believing in God. He had his reasons. Although we arrenged to meet here, you didn't have to get in. People are waiting. I think he said something about me but I didn't quite understand. "The rough solitude of today's man." Dopin, what a relief. I dreamt that they put me naked in a sarcophagus. Naked! Oh, Dopin! Advertising is a way to promote oneself. The whole world will be open-mouthed admiring your beauty. And my erotic possibilities... Especially in TV clubs in small illiterate villages. I prefer not to get in the game. Do you want to be Miss Umbrella? No! Miss... Orangeade? No! Miss Smile? No! Miss Swimsuit? No! Miss Whiskey? No! No! Miss Motorcar! No! Miss No? No! Thousands of people are waiting to buy the product you'd recommend them. It's a funny game. Like Blind man's buff. But it damages the brain more. There'll be men that'll end up getting laid with washing machine. Or a fridge! Thinking they are doing it with the cute girl who advertises it. Watch out with that ideas. Pretend. If you say such things they'll take you to the masters and they'll punish you for being bad! And they'll put me with the people who get attacked by the police out of duty. "More difficulties to help Biafra." We're living in a world that is collapsing and everything is useless to sustain it. Do you think people, everyone of us, think about this? I don't think so. So they don't have to acknowledge they failures. Especially the people in charge. Do you cry often? No, never. The last time I cried I felt very ridiculous. And since then I didn't have more reasons. Or I get rid of them. Did you ever have a conscience for your needs? No. Since a long time. What needs? I don't know. I have a consciente for my satisfactions. And what about friendship? Neither. I would be classifying people. I feel a person even if I don't notice them. And if I don't notice them then I don't know them. Would you sacrifice for someone? No. If I think about it, I wouldn't. Without thinking, impulsively... Maybe. You're not capable of an heroic attitude. What a nonsense! There's too many heroes. I won't go to war. If nobody went to war, then there wouldn't be any. How old are you? 19. Carlos could almost be your grandfather. How funny! Surely. But I am older. He's like a little boy. When did you've your first intercourse? When I felt like it. It's a necessity that shouldn't be avoided. With how many men did you have relationships? That's the tipe of questions a sexually repressed person'd make. Very few, really. Would you do it with me? If we both wanted it at the same time. Yes, sure. Didn't you ever think of a more stable way of life? Which one? I think mine is stable. Maybe I would like to participate in some things I observe, But I don't know how. I don't want to suffer for comfort. Do you know that you are living at the shore of an abyss? No, I don't know it. And it's not true, I'm fine this way. At least I never complain. Are you sincere? I never have a reason to lie. Are you Catholic? No, I'm sorry. But I think I'm baptized. It was mandatory when I were born. Do you feel disappointed if someone ignores you? I have never noticed it. But I don't think I'd feel disappointed. You forget easily. I never have anything to forget. I never think about things twice. Haven't you ever wrote your thoughts or... about what have happened to you. Something like a diary. I used to do it before. I did it often when I was dating a boy that wrote. I don't want to feel tied to something or to someone. I would feel really bad, very uncomfortable. I would feel like I'm cheating on them. Lying, and I'd have to hide it. Come to my place. Huge. I'm starting to hear the silence. Dopin is not a good partner anymore. It would be better for us to be always friends. I don't want us to be friends. I want you to love me. My room has always been my refuge. But now my bed is colder. It has lost Antonio's warmth. I would get used to needing you. And I want to avoid my last disappointment. I like you a lot. I love you. It sound cheesy, but I love you. I'm annoyed by relatives that come to visit me and ask me: How are you? "A youth to often worried by the future." May 1968. "The terrible monday." Why did they title it "terrible"? "Reject the intoxication." I'll love Carlos in order to learn his experiences. "The fight continues." "Seven killed in the clash between police and students." "The reactionary brutality." "The fight in mexican cities persists." In order to learn from his experiences. "The Pope wants to be solidary with the cause of the poor." "We know the..." We are starting to have a great life standard. We can see a lot of cats on the streets already. Who said that nonsense? In times of war, all the cats disappeared. I ate cat in Seville after the war. Who is saying that nonsense? There wasn't any rabbits too... I don't know anything about that. Who cares? Why they are still talking about those things? Me. You? Who are you? Me. I was trying to write this story but I run out of cigarettes. I need cigarettes to start this story. I couldn't find a cigarette machine that worked. but... I don't mind walking in search of another. I like the streets at night. And I saw the cats. I can give you marijuana. Smoke marijuana and you'll write a better story. I don't want to write a better story. Today I cried when I heard Dubcek was killed. I'll write clenching my teeth. And I'll hold the pen as if it was a tommy gun I once were afraid to hold. "Van Thieu has no objections to a temporary suspension of the bombing." "Risk of civil war in Panama." 14.000 dead and 100.000 homeless. Iran... Earthquake... "A german commits suicide." "Lin Shao Chi..." "Mao.." "All united until victory." I don't want to read the newspapers today. I don't want to see anything. I don't want to think about anything. I want to feel good here... with you. Everything is nicer when one smokes. Don't you want to try it? No, I prefer smoking this. One loves better... One loves much better. Try it! Smoking is a pacifist attitude. As a curiosity... I'm not curious. Don't insist. You should try it. Take it. Not that one. This one. That one smalls bad. I'll make you get used to this. To interest yourself in new and good things. "Six hours before, Johnson knew Czechoslovakia was going to be invaded." "Martin Luther King has died." "Chicago occupied by tanks." "A tank can destroy it all but it can not create the government the people desire." I prefer not to think. Think about what? About all that horrors? Smoking is a protest attitude. It's almost revolutionary. To be stunned... I prefer music over the noise of tommy guns. Also the music of those who can't play. I like to play even though I don't know how to. The sound of flute is very pleasant. And it's good to have friends that feel the same way. Yeah, it's really good to have friends that think the same way. You look miserable. I feel so good. Your pretty eyes don't have any expression. And they look smaller. I smoked a little bit. And I played the flute. A boy who has been to India told me very beautiful stories. I would suffer a lot if you had to be hospitalized. I just smoke a little bit. Now and then. But..! It'll affect your brain. You'll lose the perspective of reality. I don't care. Everything is so beautiful. My love... I would like you... to react. To interest yourself in... something different than destroying yourself. Someone has kissed me. Everything, surely. And I felt you. I loved you so much. Don't ever leave me. Many of the dead who, according to the government, were enemies who were executed were actually peasants. Againts whom the troops shooted as they were entering into the village. because they saw them running. It's possible that some could sympathize with Vietcong but others were running because they didn't want to be taken to the army or forced labour. We have to protect yourselfs! We'll tell everyone to put the helmets on. Look at that bathtub. Shall we take it? Being a bricklayer isn't more dangerous than being a miner. Above all the heads wanders a squadron of nuclear charges. Law enthusiasts should command everyone to have a helmet. That way they'd also avoid having people kissing around. which they don't like at all. That is really difficult to do... and grotesque... The worst would be that the mandatory equilibrium of the head was actually avoiding the accustomed stupidity assimilated through all the mass media. They would increase. There would be thousands. Concentration camps. And the ones that were still conscious... and tried... to escape... The russian tanks are leaving. EUREKA! The tension eases. Today the terror... can rest a little bit. But taking off our helmets is still reckless. Because France detonates their first H-bomb. "Mexico city is still ocuppied by their own troops." "State of siege in Guatemala." "Condemned to death in Haiti." I'm going to be concerned with what happens. I'm going to quit smoking in order not to deform reality... and seeing as it is. As it is now. Let's see... The people in charge... How old is Johnson? How old is Kosygin? How old is Franco? How old is Salazar? How old is Mao Tse-Tung? De Gaulle? Ho Chi Minh? All of them! "People over 50 years old can't find a job." "Everywere, they have to pass their work to younger people." "And they are the ones with greater responsibility." (Kennedy: Seriously wounded in an assassination attempt) (Kennedy has died) Guys! Do you know the news? Bob Kennedy was murdered. The old ones... will never allow the less old... hold the important positions. Why are you laughing at someone's death? Actually, we're not laughing precisely at someone's death. (Robert F. Kennedy burried in Arlington.) My father is dead. Lost in this world of dead. My mother was from the living world but also died. I've destroyed and thrown away everything related to them in order to free the house absolutely from past. I...I like it like this now. It's constantly provisional and ultimate in every moment but it's huge. All the lights are switched on and all the doors are open, so that I can avoid the surprise of some dark corner that could remind me that I'm afraid. Ole! Ole! Such joy! "This year there may be two Nobel Peace Awards." Kill him! Bite him! (If I'm elected president, I'll stop the bombing raids over North Vietnam.) (There will be no suspension of the bombing raids on Vietnam.) A man can decide (Murderer!) A man can give the order to stop or continue the slaughter. No... (We want blood!) "5.000 death." "... german public official." Come on! Come on! Kill him! What's wrong, Carlos? My love, where are we? Take that off! One cannot agree with hippies! I don't... I don't want to agree with anything. I can't... I can't... But one cannot have a passive attitude right now! We have to do something. You should have seen it! There! Shouting and jumping like apes. Half the world is dying of hunger. The trenches burnt out by the bombs. Suffering repressions... And there are thousands without knowing it and wanting to get distracted. Hold me. But what can we do? We can't do anything. We should do something. There must be something we can do. "It's urgent to have a legal procedure for the represion of social crimes." "If I am elected President, the bombing raids will be ceased." I'm going to take up photography again. 50 years trusting, hoping... to end up realizing that I was wrong. You can help me. I'll take pictures that will be evidences. You won't be able to do it. They won't let you photograph anything usefull. I believe it's forbidden to forbid. I'll do it even if they don't let me. It's dangerous for a woman. Remember that we should always wear our helmet. It requires vocation... a great consciousness. I want to have it. A revolutional consciousness. I'll change the camera for other machine if that way I can be more usefull. That would be more dangerous... I'm not afraid. I'm a suicide supporter. I'm not. I have always been against it. It's another mistake of yours. Maybe... Maybe... Cesare Pavese Hemingway Marilyn Monroe Juan Belmonte Pamela Moore and someone else... Stefan Zweig was the first? Yes "For the events that make my people suffer so much..." "Only justice, freedom and peace will save Latin America." "Violence and bloody revolution will be inevitable if..." "Public order cannot be discussed on the streets, the university nor anywhere else." "This is how the freedom died." Hidding it's not a solution. One have to face the consequences. Come on, come out! I'm meditating. There's no time for meditating. We have to go, go, go. It's stopping... Maybe it's better for it to stop. But no. We have to make it go at full speed until it bursts. We need fire. More fire! More wood! It's the war. Hey everybody! We've to finish off this war and be victorious. The victory has a direction. We have to seek for it. We've to change the direction. It's been 2.000 years since we think this but we didn't achieve anything. The only ones that were allowed to speak have always said that the world goes like a clockwork. And the majority of them have been forced to believe it. The world goes like a clockwork... This structures don't serve anymore, they are not used. They're to old, to heavy. You must understand that not everything is useless. A lot of what you call old is just old-fashioned. History, culture and tradition are crucial for us... Things are the way they are. Look around you. Everything is useful. You're funny. I see everything as it has always been... "More than 3000 million rational animals... turns around it's axis every 24 hours and a bit more..." A worldwide organization called UN to which belong approximately 120 countries that keep out another that has a population of almost 800 millions people. In 1948, when they weren't so many countries yet that UN did its transcendental Declaration of Human Rights... which almost no human knows, fortunately... because it has been useless. In 1968, they recall it with nostalgia and declare that year the International Human Rights Year. Two thirds of humanity starve. but most of them don't know that that's not their natural way of living. UNESCO UNICEF Hague Tribunal Vatican... The defence budget increase to larger quantities than that are necessary to resolve the problems of food and education. The last war 1939-1945 cost 375 billion dollars. 32 million young men died in battle fields. 20 million women, elders and children in the bombing raid. 30 million maimed. 45 million deported. 1 million orphaned. You look to the right: you see nothing. You look to the left and see nothing either. United States, conferences on disarmament, infinity of agreements, deals, conferences, meetings, congresses... Daily. Despite all that... Oh, look, the bathtub! There's bizzare stuff for example: The vietnam thing is not a war. It started 7 years ago but... It's really a rare bathtub. ...there isn't a declaration of war on North Vietnam. However, they are meeting in Paris since April in order to find a way to end this war... which is nonexistent. They meet every Wednesday. Maria! Maria! Where are you? If we split we might get lost. It's just an old house in ruins Probably it was very pretty and comfortable for someone and it still is important for many people. I want to be an elephant. Sure, there's beauty in desolate landscapes. Everything has its good side. If I were to have a child it would be an elephant and his name would be Vulvo. Elephants know what freedom is. I'll find freedom too! I don't want to have a child. I don't! I don't! Shit. Elephants are ready to go. We can already here their footsteps and the ground is starting to tremble. Eh Julian! We hear their screams from every university. Nothing's going to change. There is a natural evolutionary process but there have always been wars there have always been good and bad, rich and poor... Youth has always been inquiring and students from all times have protested for whatever reason. Everything must have an order. Men need welfare and they work all their life to obtain it. Times gradually change and day by day we live better. Everybody can by a little car go on vacation... Labourers have access to social security sistem and to retirement when they reach old age. In my opinion, people wear out too much energy on useless complaints, many of them unjustified. What are you saying, Carlos? My life, what are you saying? It saddens me so much to hear you talk like that, as a parrot. You broke the television! "Guard strike on the Czech border." Miners... Conference on disarmament, hit to death." "Johnson cannot restore peace." When we where alive, we walked along the pathways, but now that we are dead we walk through this great wilderness. I don't want to remember my childhood... When we where alive, we walked along the pathways, but now that we are dead we walk through this great wilderness. What a wonderful weather. It doesn't look like autumn. Sometimes I feel you so far away from me... You always leave. You're a strange man. You have kind eyes. I'd like to know an equal world. Do you have a solution? No, I don't, my love. Do you think about it? Of course. Will you find it? No... Why are you crying? There must be something we can do. We can go drink coffee with milk. We know that both of us like it very much. Why are you crying? There must be something better we can do. We can go to drink coffee with milk. We know that both of as like it very much. "The struggle continues." "Paris in rage." "Students' riot." No, no, no, I can be concerned about what interests me. Have you thought about how your lifestyle will change? I'm not sure that I'll like the same things I like now. I don't want to make plans. Do you hope to always live with that indifference? It's not indifference. I just want to have the feeling that I live every moment the best I can. What if you were forced to make a commitment? It would have been hard to accept it. Don't you think you'll end up feeling alone? Yes, It happens to me often but I'm getting used to it. I almost prefer it, sometimes I do. There are very few people with interest, very few things with interest. Have you thought about getting married? I've thought that I won't do it. And when you find a man with whom you'd like to stay forever? I won't stay with anyone more than they want me to, and I want to, of course. How was your childhood? Childhood... I don't remember it. One always have memories from childhood. I've managed to forget it. I still have some toys left. I relief my bad mood with them when something goes wrong. I've wanted to throw them since forever. But Dopin, my dog, it's a great partner. Do you have an opinion on the world's situation? Opinion? What do I know? Opinion... Yes... I would like to be everywhere to know all that happens, how it happens and why it happens. Than I'd have an opinion. What is your political inclination? Political? I'm more interested in music. No, don't tell me that's a distraction... Well, actually I'm not sure. A friend of mine wrote in a board a phrase that I like: "Try to stop the negative expression as much as you can." For me, politics are a negative expression. Sometimes I like to look at myself in the mirror. Do you use the mirror as a concentration exercise or as if you needed to know you exist? In a normal state, I never lose consciousness of myself. I also try to find connection points with the world around me. And the most important point right now is Carlos? Before you said you love him. I think nobody loves no one. It's just an agreement that come up occasionally between two persons who share a situation that satisfies both of them. Without definitive engagement? Yes, sure, much better. But it can last forever? Maybe, maybe it's possible. With Carlos it's risky, years go by quickly. I don't think about the risks, ever. I love Carlos and we have good time together. The age difference doesn't matter? No, no, It doesn't. Not to me. Does he share your ideas? They're different. Does he know how old you are? Sure. Do you know he's taking the risk? You should ask him that. We like to be together. We are very well. We'll defend ourselfs. We'll defend ourselfs entrenched from who may attack us. Come. Is someone waiting for you? Stay. I'm 56 years old. Me too. That can't be. 112 years are too much. We are 37. Each one of us. Don't you want to try it? Come. Here. Come. If you leave, I'm going with you. Come. Here. Take it. Come. Police! Open up, open up! Police! Open up, open up! Open up! Open up! Open up! Police! Open the door! Let's go. Books are a good place to hide it. They get very nervous and try not to mess with them. They won't bother to glance over. "Tragic evaluation of the riots in Mexico University." "6 death, about 130 injured..." "Miss Europe, the Misses..." "Rio de Janeiro, a student dies, a labourer..." "Excitement before the imminent opening of the University." "Borders = Repression" Mexico: Repression or democracy? "Clash between student groups in S?o Paulo: One dead and many injured." "The public force takes up the Mackenzie University." "Almost 400 injured in the barricade fights in the Latin Quarter." "Bloody clash in Mexico." "Police, students..." Joaquin got busted when he was sending a letter to Italy. We have to be more careful. Watch every step we take. Check the letters, the phone... Be sure of who you talk with and what you say. Be careful. They searched through his house and found things. They'll go for everyone who's in his contact list. We should get rid of contact list. For some time we'll only meet when it's indispensable and every time in a different place. They came to my house last night. I didn't open up because I didn't want to involve Carlos. They were good. They didn't insist much and I haven't noticed any vigilance. They wouldn't go for you. They know some of whom they are looking for go to your house. I called to warn you. I let the phone ring for a long time. They had just left. I thought they were checking if there really wasn't anybody. We'll stop all the connections until we know for sure if some of us are under surveillance or not. I don't know why I'm involved. Just because I'm your friend. Are you afraid? Yes. I am. "Soldiers against students in Mexico University." "20 dead, many injured and almost five hundred detainees." "New disturbances in Paris." "The protests continue in Mexico..." "In Paris, a group of university students..." "Israeli Air Forces bombard Jordan" "28 dead and 82 injured." "If malaysians set foot on Filipino territory, I'll go to war with my people." No... no... I don't want to write a story about the West. Of course, even if you see me here, no, I don't. In any case, I would like to write a story about the East. A story that would make everybody understand what is happening in the East. I would also like to show that things aren't going well neither in the West nor in the East. Because the situation requires young people to take responsability. Younger and younger. One would have to write so many things... The difficulty is in selecting... Choosing the most urgent... and better that writing... and better that writing... it's screaming protesting provoking becoming violent. Writing is useless. You don't remember me, huh? Nieves? Oh, no... Men insist on building fake worlds. They insist. They no longer know what their job is good for. No, actually they never knew it. They also make devices to destroy the world to kill their brothers, their sons and themselfs. Hey, Maria! Wait! You're a traitor. Why haven't you called me? Why haven't you called me? Who's Nieves? A friend from Paris. You're a traitor. You're an intruder. I have managed without friends, lovers, family... What is family? What are we doing in this mausoleum? Let's have a drink. What are you doing today? I came to see you. We'll have drinks all day. But people like fake worlds that stun them, alienate them, stupefy them (in case you don't know what alienate means). Watch out! "A bomb explodes in Athens." "Fighting on the border between Malaysia and Thailand." "Russia..." "The Pope to the peasants: the social problem has worsen nowadays because you've became aware of your needs." These guys, who are editing a magazine on mimeograph wanted to know Carlos' opinions. No, no, no, it wasn't possible. There was no possibility of understanding. Baker, my friend, you who make bread and trade it for money. One day those hands that make the bread will move, not for money, but to feed the people just to feed the people. For that day to come, my friend, let's put our hands together. For that day to come, all hands clasped, hands of all people. Baker, my friend, you who make bread and change it for money. Above the sky the sun sings clear and bright. Far from my nose and my dry chest. Oh who could, beyond the glass window, under the saint sun, far from this city, from you, from me, from everyone, run free and naked across the fields. If only one could escape by running, running and running. with the head held high and free feet. with the head held high and free feet. If escaping was just running, running and running. Because our necks are tired, and our knees are weaker. Because what happened to our spears? Because all our protests, serious and dressed in suits, aren't hymns just mere words. Because we'll never walk over the mountains like we used to dream. Because, young men, we'll never... I had friends. They walk along, they walk, and they'll. I had friends, they walk by the other side of the sea. I've forgotten you already. I don't know you. Oh the jealous kid. Leave me alone. I'm working. Wait. As soon as there's young people around, you forget me even if I'm right in front of you. But they're such a sad group, they don't even smoke Yeah... right. Don't work now. It's already ruined. You should stop working when I'm here. Yes, I can't do anything whatsoever... my work will be ruined. Come on, Carlos. Leave me. I'm not joking. Look. One print more, one print less. And every time you show up I end up doing nothing and afterwards... I'm lost. Go there, buy newspapers. More? We already have a lot! Buy them, we have to be updated. Whatever you want. Today is such a great day! There's a good new! You're an optimist. Let me see. They didn't murder Dubcek. Carlos, look! Monsignor defends his clergy. People misunderstand communism with thirst for justice nowadays. Priests want to behave well. It's useless. They'll cut their heads no matter what. Prague on probation under Moscow. This is getting complicated. Read. Prague on probation under Moscow. This reminds me of an idea of my friend Philippe. For him jail is a symbol of freedom, everytime he told the truth freely he ended up in jail. College students try to boycott the Olympic Games in Mexico. One. Two. Three. We should've been there too! Immediately after his return, Czech Assembly's President cried while adressing the people about the outcome of the discussions with Moscow. Industrial Development. Housing. School-age.

If you don't cry you don't get fed, if you don't steal you're a stupid. Just go ahead! Keep it up! There, in hell we're going to meet. Don't think anymore. Where are you going? Where do you want to go? I don't know. Think about it. Maybe you still can do something about it. Yes. Maybe I can scream for help. 1968 as the International Human Rights Year that allow men to scream for help. To whom?
