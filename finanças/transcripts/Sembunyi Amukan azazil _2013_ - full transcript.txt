The Japanese invasion of Malaya. Quick! What's this? Where's the other half? Drink this, my child. Calm down, you have not well. Who are you? Calm down, you have not well. Who are you? Mother... Who are you? Mother... Our guest has just waken up. I'm Ibu Yani. That's Kamal. He found you. Found me? I was running away from the Japanese. How do I wake up... Here? Where am I? Where am I! You were half dead when I found you. I brought you here. Where's my necklace? I didn't see any necklace with you. How long have I been here? Good thing that you've waken up. What's your name? I don't remember. You have not fully recovered yet. Don't worry, just rest well here. Child... Why did you bring me here? How can I know if this is not part of the Japanese's trick? Impossible! How can I know if this is not part of the Japanese's trick? Impossible! Take a good look around here. We don't have any bad intention. Take a good look around here. We don't have any bad intention. You said you found me in the forest. Bring me there, I want to go home. That place is surrounded with soldiers. Our place is hidden by a lake, they don't know that there's a village here. Let me go. Wait. How did you find me? I was looking for some herbs for Ibu Yani. I heard them soldiers exchanged fires, so I hid myself. I came out of my hiding place when things went quiet. Then I saw you. Wait. This is the place... - You found me. This is the place... - You found me. Do you remember anything? Where are you going? Let's go back. There's only a graveyard here. This is not a graveyard. This was my village. Aishah. That's my name. The Japanese came to kill us. But I escaped. You're too noisy. The monkeys are more well-behaved. A quiet one is more charming. Our monkey has a friend. She's the outsider that brought in? I just want to help her. What's your name? My name is Salleh. What's the matter, Kamal? Are you scared that I will take her away? No. I'm saving your face. What would others say if you behave like this? Do you hear that Atan? Do hear what this weakling is saying? Enough. Kamal, bring you new friend home. Don't linger around the forest. My child, have some food please. Please take care of your health. Kamal told me what had happened to your village. You can just stay here. This is your home now. I'm taking my leave. Why do you look so sad? Are you thinking about your loved one? My name is Melor. This is Harum. Let's have a walk. I'm not feeling well. This is our village. This is Kak Melor's house. This is my house. What's that gong for? If only Kamal would choose me to be his wife. You're married, Hanum! That was just a wishful thinking. If he chose me, we would have a new head of the village. What are you talking about? Kamal is the son of the former head. According to our custom, he cannot replace his dad until he is married. I thought Atan is head of the village. Melor! Yes dear. Atan is Melor's husband. Hanum! Just a minute! I'm in the middle of a conversation here! See you tomorrow. Little girl! Wait! What are you doing here? There's a girl in the cave! What are you doing here? There's a girl in the cave! It's getting dark. I know what I saw! What is this place? What are these carcasses for? This place is full with wild tigers and beasts. Let's get out of here. Come here! Little girl! You look pale. Are you preparing for dinner? I'm making chicken gulai for tonight. Can I help you? I'm so happy there's someone helping me out with the dishes. You were holed up in your room for days. Can I ask you something? I saw a young girl this afternoon. Who? A girl. A young girl. There's a black mark on one of her hand. The other hand is kind of deformed. A black mark? I don't know any girl like that. What is it dear? Just tell me. I'm worry to see you like this. You looked worry. I saw you... putting the rice on the ground. What is it for? That's for the protection. Protection from what? The water is boiling. Hurry up with the chicken. Mother... Hurry up! Get ready! What's going on? Follow me. Close the doors. Whatever happens do not go out of this house. - But why?! Promise me! - But why?! Promise me! Aishah!! Aishah! Don't go out, Aishah! Ibu Yani's house is attacked! Atan is right, the girl is nothing but trouble! Why do you always believe anything that Atan says? Don't raise your voice! Why do you side with him all the time? We haven't been under attack for a long time, why now? Why don't you just marry Atan then? The tree... Find that tree! Aishah! What was that thing? There is a book inside the chest. Bring the book to me. Some people said it's a demon. Some others said it's the devil himself. Or its real name... Azazil (Lucifer). Azazil? Azazil (Lucifer). Azazil? The real name of the devil that refused to bow to Prophet Adam. He was banished from the heaven and sent to the earth. He was sent to this land. Our ancestors had made a pact with the devil. For as long as we serve him the feasts, he will let us live here. The salt and rice that you saw the other day, are the barrier so that he won't enter this village. Do you believe in this creature? What I believe is not important. What important is the thing exists. How come they all died? When the devil comes, all animals will die. The food will spoil. The water will turn into... ...blood. Now we know how the devil enters the village. Who breached the barrier? Newcomer! You did this right? What's the use of blaming her? Kamal is right. It's not the time to fight among each other. Salleh died because somebody let the devil in. I want to know who did it! It was me! I was chasing something... I didn't know! I didn't know! I didn't know! I didn't know! It's our fault for not letting her know! Salleh died because of her! So? Are you going to kill her? Go away! Little girl! Wait! Who are you? Where did you get this? It's me. You're having a nightmare. The girl has my necklace! It's me. You're having a nightmare. The girl has my necklace! What girl? The girl has my necklace! What girl? I don't know! Mother, promise me that you will never leave me! I promise. Mother, thank you. This is your village too. You were having a nightmare last night. That was all his doing. Who? That was all his doing. Who? The devil. He wants to scare us off. When human is weak, the devil will be stronger. But our barricade is getting stronger. They won't stand a chance. What's wrong, Kamal? Enough. What are you doing Atan? I'm trapping the devil. Let him challenge us, we should never challenge him! Mother is right. We had prepared the feasts for him. Do you think the devil will give a damn about it? He will just do as he pleases. Do you think the devil will give a damn about it? He will just do as he pleases. Do you think you can trap him like a deer? You won't be able to take his wrath! Then what about my wrath?! No! That thing will kill Hanum! Please find Hanum. I know she's still alive! If you won't, I will do it. Atan, let me heal her. Hanum! You saw it too, right? See what? - I saw it in the devil's eyes. See what? - I saw it in the devil's eyes. There's a palace. - I saw it in the devil's eyes. There's a palace. And there's a tree deep in the forest. There are stones scattered around the tree, ...just like tombstones. Eno ugh, that was all the devil's doing. Help me out here. Mother! Hurry up! Take them to the village. Where's Kamal? Hurry up! Ibu... Hakim! - Ibu! Aishah, look at me. He don't see us. Look! I've catched the devil! I deserve to be the head of the village! Go back to Ibu Yani! Go! Go! Please kill me Atan. I tried to save our people. It's not my fault. Everyone knows who's fault is this. Is this my fault? It's the devil, he don't need any reason. Atan believes it's my fault. Atan can believe anything he wants. Do you believe it then? I believe... that I cannot live if there's anything happens to you. I saw it yesterday. I was afraid that the devil will kill you. I don't mean to offend you. I've never been more afraid before. I must have a past. I don't remember anything about it. I'm afraid it might get between our way. I understand. Do you like this song? Can you see Hanum, Aishah? You will see some day. Go inside, it's not safe here. He's a soldier! Did the Japanese did it? We found him in the forest. Just go inside! What is this? Who gives the permission? We found him in the forest. Just go inside! What is this? Who gives the permission? Ibu Yani! You should know what will happen if we let outsiders come into our village! Then, do you propose that I let him die? You should know what will happen if we let outsiders come into our village! Then, do you propose that I let him die? Go inside, child. I will try to heal him. What's wrong, Aishah? This is what I feel. What's wrong, Aishah? This is what I feel. I don't know who I am. But I feel safe when you hug me. How about the guest? Is he well? Not yet. I will bring you to see him when he's getting better. How about the guest? Is he well? Not yet. I will bring you to see him when he's getting better. There's something that I need to ask you. Kamal told me this morning. He wish to ask your hand in marriage. You don't like it? Who says I don't? Now you're someone's husband, and the new head of the village. Thank you, mother. Are you getting married, Aishah? Look at that, Hanum. I wasn't even invited. Let me introduce myself. My name is Melor, the palace dancer to Sultan Muadzam Shah of Melaka. You snatched away my life. You buried it under the tree. So that I don't remember about myself. Why?! What did I do wrong? What are you saying! I followed you. I saw you buried the soldier's clothes! I know who you all are! I know what you did! I know who you all are! I know what you did! I can see everything now. Put that thing down! And I have let him in! Go away Aishah! Find the way out, Aishah. You cannot stop me. Take me, devil! Find the way out, Aishah! Devil! Dear! I saw a woman, she has the same birth mark with the girl! Peace be upon you. You! You were looking at me from the window. You have recovered! For quite a while already. But Ibu Yani said... What did she say? You're a soldier right? How do you know? I saw you when Ibu Yani brought you. You were badly injured. I don't remember many things. I was piloting the plane, and the emergency lights blinked. I don't remember many things. I was piloting the plane, and the emergency lights blinked. There must be something wrong with the fuel tank. That's the only thing that I remember. A plane? Weren't you fighting with the Japanese? That's not possible. Japanese occupation was a long time ago. I wasn't born yet. Why? This village is making you sick you now? I saw how you seduced Kamal. I know the likes of you. Everyone want to live forever. Everyone want to live with the likes of you. Everyone want to live forever. Everyone want to live with the likes of you. Do you know why the devil is here? Because of people like you. Not because of us. Because of people like you. Not because of us. I used to have everything. I used to have a family. I used to have Melor. But because of the people like you, I've lost everything! There's no way to escape from here! I was just giving an advice to your wife! Find the tree! I followed you. I saw you buried the soldier's clothes! I know who you all are! I know what you did! I can see everything now. Sis... Where's mom? I'm scared! I don't want to die! Remember... Take this with you. Please find me with this. I will find you! Promise? I promise! Don't be afraid, Umi! Umi! What do you want?! What else do you want me to do?! What did she talking about? What we did is wrong! I have to get out of here! I need to find my people! Are you leaving me? Aishah, what's wrong? I can see now, you're all monsters! Aishah, what's wrong? I can see now, you're all monsters! I am not. I can explain. Explain this! I can explain. Explain this! I remember now. I know who am I. I have a family. What did you do to me? Where are you going? Are you leaving me? Are you leaving me?! Why are you leaving me?! I've saved you! You're ungrateful! Quick! We have to leave! This is the only place that they won't dare to enter. She's my wife! I am not your wife! Aishah? Listen to me. You kidnapped me! I love you. I love you from the moment I saw you. Look at me. Look at me! Aishah! That's his house! Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Aishah! That's his house! Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Where are we going? I don't know. But she might. Here I am. Is that why you showed me this cave? What do you want me to do know? Can we believe her? Just follow me. Can we believe her? Just follow me. Maybe this is the way out. Wait! The creature.... I understand it now. We have to get out of here! - That creature is not a foe. We have to get out of here! - That creature is not a foe. I saw it in his eyes! The old woman was drawing this cave. Where are you going? I told you there is no way out. You're still such a weak, Kamal. No! Don't touch him! Kamal! I never forced you. I am not like them. I will never take anything that is not mine. I am not a human. But I love you. Look at me, Kamal. Please let me go. Let me go. Aishah... Miss... Miss! Where are you going? Don't be afraid. You know who am I right? Where am I? Tell me! You're safe now. I will tell you what happened to you. I saw you for the first time when I was little. I was hiding from the Japanese soldiers. I saw him took you away. I can enter the other world, but I can't make a contact with you. I've thought of other ways. I've tried to tell you through your dreams. Years went by but I've never stop to show you the way out. I know this place. Why do you bring me here? You were already here. You were trapped in the bunian place for 60 years. Bunian? You were trapped in the bunian place for 60 years. Bunian? That's what we call the creatures that befriended you. Melor... Don't you hear my voice? I can't see you anymore. Where are you? Who is that? Aishah! You don't recognize me? I'm Hanum! Let's take a walk. That's Kamal's house. If only I can become a wife of the head of the village. That's my house and Salleh's. That's Melor's house. I can't hear Melor's voice anymore. What happened to her? I want to go back! I missed everyone! I missed Melor! The last time I saw her was less than a year ago. How can this happened? The time line over there is not same like here. When they took Hanum a way, she can't accept the fact that a long time has passed in the real world. Everyone she knew has long gone. The village is the only place she knew. Who took her away? The devil? Azazil? The creature is a djinnn that we sent away... to rescue those people that were trapped inside the other world. The cave is where the creature lives. Why do the bunian kidnapped us? To make you a companion, or life partner. They need to survive. Why didn't you gave up on me? Why do you have to torture me? I should have aged now, I should have been dead now! I'm not the one who didn't give up on you. Then who? It is me, sister. I've never stop looking for you! Umi...! Let's go in, sis. Umi...? You made me promised to never leave you. You can't disturb me anymore, I am free! But your child is not! I am free! But your child is not! This is your child with Kamal. I will come back for the child! Follow me! Sister, what's wrong?
