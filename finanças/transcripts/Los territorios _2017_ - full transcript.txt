Let's see, what's the capital city of Tanzania? Dar Es Salaam. Papua New Guinea? Port Moresby. Albania? Tirana. - Japan? - Tokyo. Mauritania? Ouagadougou. No, it's not. It's Nouakchott. OK. Armenia? Yerevan. Bolivia? La Paz. Iceland? Reykjavik. Pakistan? Islamabad. South Africa? Joh... No! Ehmm... Pretoria. Micronesia? Ehmm... No. I don't know. Palikir. - Mexico? - Mexico City. More difficult. Seychelles? Victoria. Laos? Vientiane. Gabon? Libreville. Kiribati? South Tarawa It was all set for me to major in History, just like my father. But it was a long major. And I didn't feel like it. It worked well with my cigarette, food and coffee addiction. But majoring in cinema did too, and it was easier. As I said, my father had majored in History. But he dedicated his life to journalism. My grandfather had been a journalist as well. But he dedicated most of his life to the aerosol industry. I don't know why. Because of them, I grew up surrounded by newspapers and magazines from all over the world. And since I was 8, I had an atlas with which I prematurely learned every capital. A goal a true Granovsky had to accomplish. Both of them made me believe that the whole world could fit inside a newspaper or atlas pages. And that I could get anywhere I wanted. After majoring in cinema, I became a film producer. I got obsessed with seeking funding abroad, and never in my own country. But I never got any money, neither in my country nor abroad. In Argentina, some thought I was serious, because I travelled. And when I did, people abroad thought it too. My memory allowed me to know the names of every film producer and their present and past productions. They all thought I had a lot of connections. Khomeini's 1979 Iranian Revolution generated a radical movement… The closest I was to majoring in History, was when I attended a few courses at the Argentinean War Correspondents Association. War was a spectacle I consumed in all of its forms. Even though I had never been to one. The teacher did. But sometimes, it seemed as if she based her classes on Wikipedia information. Like myself. During the 90's, the paper where my father works, Pagina/12 delivered once a week an amazing title of historic-political cinema L'Armata Brancaleone; Brancaleone alle crociate; Pasqualino Settebellezze; I compagni; Mimi Metalurgico; La clase operaia va in paradiso; La grande guerra... My favourite was another one... "In a country reigned by a corrupted democracy, where the state uses its police and army to eradicate any left wing threat, an opposition member of parliament is murdered. A young magistrate takes over the investigation, and in the meantime an ambitious journalist accumulates proof using unorthodox methods. 1969. “Z”, by Costa-Gavras. A film producer would never trascend. A legitimate Granovky had to direct. One of my attempts was to direct a documentary on the everyday life of the peshmergas in the Iraqi Kurdistan. Well... Those are not kurds. They are Mendocinos. And... No. That's not Kurdistan. Is Mendoza. In west Argentina. It's believed that in that area, the Inca Empire ended and the Mapuche Kingdom began. I couldn't stand for the lie I was creating. And I asked to be killed. That was my third unfinished film. The first one was a fiction about ETA members that ceased fire. I hadn't done enough research, so the script was implausible. As the shooting began I decided to cancel everything. The second one was a fiction film as well, in which two unemployed Aphrodite and Hephaestus got to Brazil to offer their services to the Underworld Regent: Michel Temer. It was plausible, but we run out of budget by the 4th day of shooting. To regain the money I had lost at the Iraqi Kurdistan, I travelled through Latin America with my father for a research he was doing. He was writing a book on the NO to the ALCA But just like me, he didn't finish it. Interviews got confirmed from one day to the next. I checked my phone every hour, just like a correspondent waiting for his next war. We flew, we did what we had to do, and then we flew back. The shortest the journey was, the more important it all seemed. My father's Interviewed were his idols. And his idols... were my idols. Mobiles completely off! Hey Celso, It's corrected. Go! Father and son! Stay there! Let's take father and son! That's my son. Now without the father. In spite of my family and friends' recommendations, I didn't go back to Buenos Aires. Without my father's permission I took part of his budget and stayed in São Paulo, just when protests for and against Dilma began to arouse. I was in Santiago during the protests for the nationalisation of education. In Buenos Aires, I didn't support it. It is an elemental way of protesting. But if there are millions,... I mean millions... It is essential. When I was out of the country I did it, like when you choose the same café in a strange city to have breakfast and disguise as a local. In their bar. Well, these were “my protests”. My domestic front line. I also used part of the budget to buy a ticket for my girlfriend Sofía, for her to join me there. Although short after that, Sofía left me. Even though I found it heroic, she'd got tired of my enormous plans, always involving traveling, and never taking care of the local routine of our relationship. I had to recover my father's budget by working for an English journalist that wanted to go over Buenos Aires' shantytowns for his TV show. I offered him to direct and produce it for the same price, and gather footage for myself. My fourth film: A documentary about journalists. Being my father's son, I wouldn't have plausible issues. Being my mother's son, I wouldn't have money ones. Action! Good one! Can we do another one? Your camera here…close shot. You... The camera goes here… Close shot. - A bit over there. - This way or...? No, always look at the main camera, ok? She'll shoot from both sides. - Ok? - Yes. - Perfect. So... Adam, the English journalist, had been to Argentina several times, but he had never been to a shantytown. Nobody else knew it, but I hadn't either. India. US., I don't know... 20 times, or maybe more. New York, Washington. Algeria. China. Hong Kong. China Beijing. Popular China or rather People's Republic of China. Cuba. Brazil, tens of times. Uruguay. Chile. Germany. I was the first journalist to be invited to the UK after the 90's normalization of relations. France. European Union as an entity. Spain. Mexico. Venezuela. Bolivia. A lot. And… No wars? Ever? No, no wars. Why? Because the paper had people in Europe to cover them… and it wasn't necessary to travel from Argentina. So I never had the chance to decide if Iwould cover one or not. I guess I would have said "Yes". For pride even. And to overcome the fear. Or maybe not. I don't know, but it's irrelevant because I never had the chance. The closest thing to a War that I covered was the “Carapintadas” uprisings in Argentina. Or the Coping of “La Tablada” regiment in 1989. That helps to understand what a journalist should feel like when covering a war. On a small scale. Why? Were you afraid? Because I was scared, because I didn't know where to stand… Because if you don't have the experience, you don't know where the front-line is. Correspondents have to know where it is. Even if it isn't a 13th century infantry battle, there's always a front-line Except for some places. Syria today for instance, where to stand in Syria right? OK... So, my father had never been to a War. I thought he did. We'd just done an entire trip through Latin America and I didn't even think to ask him that. When I was young and went to the airport to say goodbye I thought he was travelling to remote and dangerous places, like an adventurer. The truth is that since 1980 he'd spent most of his time travelling on presidential planes for a few days and then he came back. He was an international affairs journalist, not a war correspondent. My imagination would just flow off. E. Salgari's Sandokan; H. Sienkewicz's In Desert and Wilderness; There's nothing as tasty as the sponteneous food in the battlefront. Maybe in another opportunity, right? That was a diplomatic peace mission. So what? Isn't that a front? - No! No way. - Yes, it is. No, we're gonna have to start all over again. An Intifada, yes... When we were in Egypt, yes... I mean to stand up, to run a risk, otherwise it's not a battlefront. I find it strange that someone like you that's a justice hero has become… Well... Well... In this... It's weird. Very weird... - Are you comfortable at the newspaper? - Yeah, I'm OK. - Sure? Yes... And I believe you... Cut it out... Do you miss it? - Um, no. - Him, I mean. - Who? Him? - Yes, him! Yes, every night. I get home and light candles on a frame I have of his and I say “My dear Claudio, where shall you be…”. I'm thankful though, having run into a cynic on the day I start wondering if I'm a bad person. I'm failing, and have no sense of humanity. The cynic, the moralizing machine of every battlefront. There you have it. For me, those were international affairs journalists and war correspondents that casually met at the airport and went to grab a bit to a barbecue. Are you calling me cynical? But... We'll be there in less than 10 minutes, right? Yes, if there's no traffic we'll get there in no time. My father took advantage of my film to get closer to me. It was that, or our family pleasure for someone to admire us. …you are always in tension… And that's a good thing. And enjoying it. Your tension and transmitting what you see. Your report, your look. Each one of us has their own way of looking. It's a lie that one theorizes about everything and the world. The more books you have read the better, but no one can take you out the common sense. It's global, wherever you are there's common sense. There're people. There're stories. “La Plata”, “Almagro”, “Tristán Suarez”, “General Rodriguez”, “Ramos Mejia"... Every district is different. You watch the sunset, you have to tell that it is the sunset. And you have to surprise yourself. If not, change your profession. If you're not curious and you don't get surprised, What do you travel for? What do you write for? I'd even ask: what do you live for? On January 7th 2015, two members of the Yemeni Al-Qaeda forced their way into the headquarters of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and murdered 12 people. A week later, I left for Paris. My mother loaned me the money. My father put me in touch with Febbro The Correspondent, his adventurer friend. It was the right time to continue my film about journalists. What do you remember from those first experiences? Your corporal experience with those conflicts. First there's a contrast between the idea one has of it and the one you get when you're there. That's what I remember. Then, who's covering an armed conflict can't judge people involved. Otherwise you don't go to a war. If you have moral, Christian, Muslim or Buddhist notions on right and wrong, That's useless for wars. Putting that aside and having in front of you or your camera or your microphone a murderer and not judge him as such, but as a political actor to avoid conflict. That amazed me. Also, there's a human loneliness feeling the people living surrounded those conflicts have. Even for the ones that actively participate in them, a feeling of total abandonment. They pay a high price for that. And as always, a distant and terrible relationship. Humanly distant and politically terrible, between geopolitics and the reality people live in, of course. And... where were you? Central America, Middle East… Central America, Middle East, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Chechnya, Colombia several times, Mexico, pretty much every big and small conflicts. In China, when Hong Kong became independent. Which are also armed conflicts because people die at them. Anyway, the list is long. I started in Latin America when the geopolitical proposal of its democratic countries imposed to armed conflicts, and peace treaties grew, like Esquipulas I and II, for which Oscar Arias won a Nobel Prize for Costa Rica. As it's usual in Latin American politics, it became more mob like than anything else. That's when I grew interest for other conflicts, like the Middle East conflicts, and so for nearly two decades I covered almost exclusively Middle Eastern conflicts. So, after two months after the attacks of 2nd of... 7th of January here in France, in Charlie Hebdo's local office I got the date wrong. Let's go again… Sorry, I got the date wrong. We're recording. So, after two months since the attacks of January 7th here in France, in Charlie Hebdo's local office seventeen person were killed, shot in cold blood by religious fundamentalists. The consequences for the politics in France and in Europe are very important. Which are the solutions? Repressive? Safety? François Hollande's politics seem not to be supported at all by French people and even less by the international community. So, National Front seems to propose a solution in finding a common enemy, and this could be an answer to national identity issues, trending topics nowadays in France. Valérie Castro was a journalist major at SciencesPo. She was smart, beautiful... and just like me, news broadcast junkie. She had worked with Febbro The Correspondent producing his journeys. When she told me how much it saddened her that she had yet to travel outside of Europe, my tough soviet face softened with tenderness. I had a crush on Valérie. Febbro The Correspondent tried to get me great interviews with his colleagues, but I was on nobody's agenda, obviously. Besides, things were cooling down in Paris and that bored me. But I had Valérie, talking to me about Front National, Sarkozy, ISIS, and Boko Haram with so much passion and wisdom I love listening to girls talking politics. Just like my cinematographic attempts, the fiction I had built about Valérie never came true. I did nothing... ...and I vanished. The journey about the journalists had to go on and luckily Febbro The Correspondent got me a job for a magazine. Argentina had reached the World's Cup Final and I had to interview a star player. The star only accepted if the journalist was Argentinean. And I would earn €800 that would come in handy. The first question that came into my mind yesterday… How do you go through the differences between Naples and Paris? As cities… Which are very different European cities. The people, the society... I mean, how is it? How did you feel the difference when you got here? Well, I noticed a big change because in Naples I couldn't go out much, I was basically at home all the time. Places were always the same, and people didn't give me a break, but… It's completely different here. I didn't know how to guide the interview with the star. I pictured asking him about the club owners he played in. When I called my dad to tell him I had unsuccessfully interviewed Pocho Lavezzi he lectured me and through many disapproval silences: “The answers are responsibility of the journalist, not of the interviewed”, he said. Febbro's friends didn't want the interview, so I didn't get the money. I felt challenged by my own ineptitude to interview. I had to go on. Go to the front. Go to war. And Febbro's stories gave me the courage I needed. "You have to be brave, but not reckless. The reckless ones die. Journalist who flees or is preserved, serves for another War." [ Baby! You still have the dollars I gave you? Or have you spent everything? I found lots of charges on Visa and Amex. So many restaurants? Can't you eat in the street? If someone steals them from you, report it immediately! Please let me know. If not I'll be worried. I love you a lot, son. Mom. How is the Santiago airport called? Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez. Kiev? Boryspil. Tehran? Imam Khomeini. - Havana? - José Martí. Bucharest? No idea. - Henri Coandă. - Okay. Quito? Mariscal Sucre. - Madrid? - Barajas. No, Adolfo Suárez. The nearest conflict was the Basque one, and the most accessible for my inexperience. I went to meet those ETA members I hadn't researched for my first film. Aitor Balboa was my guide during the first days, chasing the hidings of those who used white masks with eagle eyes. March 30th 1992 Francisco Mugica Garmendia, AKA Pakito Captured in a marginal neighborhood of Bidart in Lapurdi. February 22nd 2001 - Francisco Javier García Gaztelu, AKA Txapote Captured during lunch at the Havana Café of Sables d'Or in Nafarroa Beherea. October 3rd 2004 María Soledad Iparraguirre, AKA Anboto Captured in a house of Salis-de-Béarn in Zuberoa. But... never had an ETA member hid in a forest cave. Terrorists weren't fairy tale elves. My hipster imaginary of the end of the world, which didn't know terror, was playing a bad turn on me. Al-Qaeda doesn't hide on a Pakistani meadow. IRA wasn't below the Cliffs of Moher. Those were guerrillas. This was different. I continued without Aitor, who wouldn't stop mocking me. I met with the Basque/Spanish translator Febbro used when covering the Basque Country. She had also been his fixer, someone a correspondent hires to be a local contact during a war. Juncal climbed the stairways towards the San Juan de Gaztelugatxe's chapel every Saturday. What is the meaning in doing this? I do it because this is a sort of sanctuary, right? I hope someone will hear my prayer, which is that my land be free. Where does your family come from? From every part of the Basque Country. Alava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa, Alava... Navarre. Is Navarre considered part of the Basque Country? What's the difference? There's a country, a land where Basque is spoken so that belongs to the Basque Country. Unlike the guide, Aitor, Juncal, the translator didn't mock me. The fact that she respected me and, above all, helped me get in touch with ETA members made me develop a sort of crush on her. Coming back from Gaztelugatxe, I went with her to a cider bar in her hometown of Biscay. I tried to kiss her. She turned her face. I was taken in for the first time in 1979. For 3 months, which is practically a joke for many. Some of my friends were locked in for 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years. Some being active and some that have been years inside and were then absolved. After those 3 months in 1979, they couldn't prove anything and my case was dismissed. Nobody paid me for those prejudices. And then I was taken in again in 1994, and it was the same story all over again, nobody could prove anything. What was the charge for? “Armed group member.” It was surrealistic, really. In one of the summaries I was charged for having San Ignacio's Anthem, which had in its lyrics the phrase “Gure patroi eta.” The word “ETA” is in the anthem's lyrics, which was in fact born from a military order, but charging me, as an ETA military group member for that, was absurd. Everything was a good excuse to put you in jail. Many times the cases were dismissed. They couldn't prove anything and you were free to go. And that's everyday life for most sons of the people of the Basque Country. So…Rikar Loredo had supposedly been a member of ETA. And he had supposedly been in jail for that. According to him, for having San Ignacio de Loyola's anthem. Arnaldo Otegui, the former leader of the prohibited party of Batasuna, the biggest in Basque independence movement, would have been a good interviewed. Maybe the best, even. Otegui served, from Logroño's jail, as the Secretary-General of the new party. “Sortu”, that means "to arise" in Basque. There's a theory of "everything is ETA” that puts any dissident militant inclined person as a member of ETA, and therefore can be put into jail under the charge of “armed group member.” Thus begins a judicial process that orders by law that Batasuna, the former left wing Abertzale party, is a member of ETA. Once there's a sentence that certifies that, every person considered to be a member of the party, is automatically linked as an ETA member. So we are put into jail under the charge “armed group member”, without having even seen a gun in our lives. Sortu's president, Hasier Arraiz, was a typical lucid, talkative... and pleasant man. But I had too much respect for him. I didn't ask anything of importance, of how he was taken in for allegedly being an ETA member, if he negotiated with Spain and how. I realised he was too focused on Europe's situation and didn't try to take him out of there. Nonetheless, it was interesting hearing him talk about the independence movement in relation to with Berlin, Brussels and Madrid's decisions. I should have stayed longer with Hasier. Or I should have gone to Logroño and meet Otegui. But I stayed in Donostia, the independence movement's epicentre, where I met Joana, a Portuguese film and television actress that had travelled to Biarritz, the French Basque Country, for an audition. I didn't tell her I was a filmmaker. I told her I was a war correspondent and was going back from Lesbos to Buenos Aires. When the beautiful Joana told me she was from Coimbra, I told her I wanted to interview Portuguese people on the economic crisis and so I could go to her home. Give me a bit of that joint... [ Iván, Can you please answer at least one email? I'm still getting expenses for my credit cards. McDonald's in San Sebastian? Weren't you in Paris? Answer me, please. "The permanent effects of austerity plans are measured in terms of absences. The 300000 Portuguese who emigrated, mostly qualified young people, will probably never return." "No matter when the bailout ends, it doesn't mean the reforms are over. The exit from the bailout doesn't imply any change in the economic policy." "The left-wing destroyed us. The right-wing too. But at least we saw in the right-wing's eyes that they wanted to destroy us." When Joana found my notes she thought my interviews in Coimbra were amateur like. She googled me and saw my father was a journalist and not me. I didn't even have the courage to tell her I was a film producer and director, and I ran away. [ Ivan, If I don't hear back from you, I'll cancel all the credit cards tomorrow. Goodbye. ] Febbro the Correspondent got me an interview with Juan Carlos Monedero, one of the Indignados Movement's ideologists and founder of the party PODEMOS. If I managed to sell it to a Latin media, I could carry on a bit longer and actually go to Lesbos. The biggest struggle against neoliberalism is that it's common sense. And to fight against that is like fighting against desire. And as long as you don't have an alternative happiness project, or utopia, or salvation it will be difficult to fight it. Neoliberalism promises endless consumerism and if everything has become a commodity, sex, friendship, knowledge, food, housing... Whoever has money can buy it all. This dream of a promise that makes one a king can't be replaced only with constant nagging. And so the left wing becomes apocalypse's prophets. As long as the left wing doesn't come up with an alternative model, it can only provide for short-term solutions. And I believed that with short-terms solutions we never finish building the possibility of replacing this common sense based in consumerism in a common sense based in new values. Pierri, we need to get another interview. Varoufakis. No, impossible. Jeremy Corbyn. No. Ségolène Royal? No, she's outdated. What about somebody from Austria? Jörg Haider? He died ages ago, Pierri. The Queen Máxima Zorreguieta. No. Okay.... Well, somebody easy to get. Everything takes time, it's not that easy. Costa Gavras? No, it has nothing to do with this. Think somewhere in between. I can't think of anything else. And I don't even know what you want to do. Okay, let's go back. That's it. Good. I think this is the best decision you made in a month. Martín Caparrós? No. Martín Granovsky. In 1989, the former leader of the People's Revolutionary Army, Gorriarán Merlo, along with 46 guerrillas, attacked and occupied the Military Regiment of “La Tablada" to avoid an alleged new coup d'état. Over 3000 police and soldiers confronted them. The occupation of “La Tablada” was the closest to a war my father has been. I was behind those buildings, I left the car; I was coming from the airport, and I was called to cover the occupation of “La Tablada” and its subsequent repression. I left the car that way, as I heard all the shooting, and walked right through the middle of the neighbourhood. There was no other way of getting oriented except for the sound of the shooting. All that area was restricted by military and police forces. And I went to find the roundabout, there was one there. The headquarters stood where that black grille is. What used to be the headquarters are now gas stations, malls, etc. I knew where the entrance was because the neighbours had told me and I was guided still by the shootings. It's quite impressing really, I remember thinking at that time how weird it felt knowing that a military headquarter was just 15 minutes away from downtown Buenos Aires. Who were the enemies? Argentineans were, but I don't mean the occupation, I mean in general. That always impressed me. When you saw a military headquarter in Argentina you could totally tell what our history would be like. Argentineans were the army's enemy, there weren't external ones. Cut! - Look, that street is called “Ivanovsky”. - Yeah. I was nearly taken in on this street. But... when? That day. A photographer from the paper saved me. But who almost took you in? Intelligence crew from the police I suppose. And why you? For being a bearded man on the loose, most who entered the regiment were as well. In this street, now I remember. And how was it? I was walking that way and four men got out of a car and detained me. But you had your press credential, right? Yes, but I didn't have time to take it out and show it. So you didn't have anything. Yes, I had my credential, the same one I have now. So you showed it and they couldn't care less. - Where? - There. - Well. - Watch it, there's a step there. Move a little further. Go further, you won't be able to… - Go a little furher, no, but there's a- - Is it too high? - Yes. You'll destroy the car. What's too high? Listen to me; just go ahead three more feet. - Now, the light it's green. - Now. Wait for me to tell you. Now. - In this place that's now… - No! Hey! Well! Well, but tell me sooner. Well, I told you to wait. Ok, so you give the action. No, I'll tell you when I'm ready. You say action. In this place, that's now all covered it use to be a gas station, we took shelter with the journalist from all the firing. It was pretty suicidal of us. Because it was absolutely crazy to do so having fuel tanks so close. But we did what we had to do. There was a phone here, and I called the paper from here, I called a Brazilian paper, too. - And could you cross the street or not? - I couldn't, but I did… I crossed it. Let's go. Come on quickly, the light's going to change On this shelters, on the pavement… Come on, come on. We took shelter from the shootings with this pavement. We got there and stuck our heads to it. So if we were shot, at least we wouldn't to the head. I'm not sure if it was helpful or not, but that's what we did by instinct. We would come and go, over and over again. The regiment was occupied to generate a popular revolt, which was completely delirious. And they resumed it with the army as if it was a combat with another army. The head of police said that he would have ended the conflict by using tear gas. Months after saying that he mysteriously died in his office. Supposedly of asthma. Until that time, everything indicated that “La Tablada” would be the closest I'd be to a war as well. And it was nothing more that a person's memory. And that person wasn't me. If there actually was a front-line, it seemed to get farther and farther away from me. Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Monaco, Germany, France, Basque Country, Spain, Portugal... A lot... And nothing. Russian, Lio told me that you ask him for money to buy a ticket to Brasilia because you'll present a project to I-don't-know-who from the government. While you are indebted with half of the world? I won't follow you in this one. Sorry, but it's over. I don't know If you left or not, but I hope you won't leave the country again until you pay me all my money back. We are fully available… And then you get bored. Is over. The thing I remember the most is the death scene. The scene? - Yes. You see him fall at the act. Like when Kennedy was shot. Everyone saw it. Just like this time. - He was shot. - Yes. And Peres? Rabin was the bigger symbol. Peres was just a companion. Some sort of minion for Rabin. - A what? - A minion, a dependent. - A minion. - Minion. What time does the plane leave? 7:30 pm. - There's time. - Yes. - You have to give me the Clonazepam. - Yeah. - No, but you're used to it. - No, but... - You should take it for long trips only. - I really need it. Doesn't Babi want to go back? No. - Yes, she's dying to go. - But... - She's a bit old. - You're going to have to put up with her. - Yes. And it's hard for her to walk. - Well... - And there's a lot of walking there. She walked a lot when she went, she's been everywhere. You'll take her when you go. Yes, I will. She'll walk slowly, but she'll keep her promise to go back. I hope some day I do too. It's one thing to go as a tourist, and another to live there. It must be very different, right? I couldn't control myself. This is Jerusalem. I managed to travel for free through the Taglit program, a Zionist organization that takes young Jews to visit Israel for ten days. After that you open your ticket and travel anywhere. My mother waived part of my debts and I sold my annual tax billing to another producer to be able to pay the rest. Two sessions with a therapist, that was probably from Mossad, eight meetings to get to know my travel partners and I was set. A free trip thanks to American billionaire jewish donators. The front line was right in front of me since I was 18, but I couldn't see it because of my anti-Zionist Jewish upbringing. I got through those ten days thanks to Iris, a girl from my group with whom I watched everynight Al Jazeera. Another unjustified love. But Iris would continue her trip to India. And me to Lesbos, to the refugee crisis. I would never see her again. [ Dear Ivan, How nice to hear from you! Regarding Lesbos, I recommend you stay in Skala Kallonis. It's a bit far from the port, but you'll be more comfortable. Everyone stays there. I've given your contact to Charlotte, from BILD, for her to help you with the police. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. That's the route a Syrian has to take from their house ruins to his shelter. During summer, thousand of refugees arrive, alive and dead. But during winter, the EU manages to escort them. During summer, the refugees can't enter the migration center for weeks. During winter, the process lasts 2 to 5 days. And there I was, looking for information to write a good column about Lesbos, not knowing how to drive, with no Whatsapp, and ashamed to ask for help to the hundreds of correspondents staying in my hotel. During summer, the resale of tickets to Athens costs more than 500 euros. During winter, only 50. After a few days, I got the courage to send the first draft I had written to Febbro The Correspondent and my father. It started like this: “With over 2000 dead migrants to this date, Europe's borders are today the deadliest in the world. At the same time, Europe oscillates between uncertain borders of its own: values, humanism, solidarity, fear, racism, political speculation and that of the strong measures destined to stop migrants from getting in and forcing them back to their countries. The Mediterranean Sea will continue to be an opencast grave and Europe will turn into an entrenched Eden.” That's Jerusalem. After spending 30 days in Lesbos I went back to Israel, to the front line, before taking my plane back home. I had written two columns that nobody wanted to publish. And Febbro The Correspondent never answered my emails. That's Sderot, an Israeli town half a mile away from the Gaza Strip. And this is my friend Erez, a radical left wing israeli. - They came from Argentina. - It fell exactly on our camp. - Where? - This is our camp. What fell? A Kass? It fell on your camp? We built it all… But never mind… What did you build here? - You built a table, chairs? - Yes... There is the valley. Thank you… Good bye! Ha! He knows Hebrew… He knows some words. What? He knows “Good Bye” and “Thank you”? Yes, he is a jew that lives in Argentina. - He is a jew? - Yes. - Is it good? - Yes, of course. That's Sderot Police Station, where the police exhibits Hamas' missiles, trying to show their destruction power at Israeli ground. It's one of the favourite destinations for NATO embassies agents. [ Ivanchi, I read the three articles from Lesbos. Who are you sending this to? Just say the word and I'll help you. I can rewrite them if you need me to. They are well written, but they're a bit arrogant and you're missing information. Let me know. Good luck, little dude, Dad. - If I may deduce a possible future... - Yeah. The occupation doesn't have an end or final date. As long as there's a Palestinian country, the occupation will remain. The only difference will be that it's going to be a country under occupation and not a nation under it. I'm afraid that's the only possibility I see in the future. That's Miki Kratsman's studio in Tel Aviv. From where he leads the organization “Breaking The Silence”, that gathers former Israeli soldiers repentant of the abuses committed or witnessed while serving in the Palestinian Territories. Every Thursday morning they take Israeli or foreigners by the settlements, showing the occupation. I found them when the tour had finished. [ Little dude, I'm reading what you write and getting emotional. Motherfucker! For that type of reports, we can think about something like Playground for you. Fast and effective info and ready. Are you coming back for the elections? According to 4 pollsters, Scioli wins in first-round. Call your grandpas. They'll be happy. The rage because of your travel to Israel is over. That's Ramallah's entrance, Palestine's de facto administrative capital. I had run into the driver Ahmed in downtown Jerusalem and we crossed on his car Qalandiya's checkpoint with great ease. The first thing I saw entering to Palestine was a soldier pointing his gun at a Palestinian kneeling on a berm. That's Bethlehem, Palestine, and 3 hours away from Ramallah. Although when you see it in the map it's only a few kilometers away, the walls and the occupation make it impossible to arrive faster. Ahmed, the driver, decided to change the route and came in Jerusalem again, to get out by the other side. I never understood where we were. Those five minutes in Israeli ground were the first for Nur, the fixer, in fourteen years. The euphoria took her to tears. I couldnt enjoy the little adventure, worried as I was for having hurried her. [ Ivanchi, will you answer any whatsapp message with more than monosyllables? Could you meet Hosni? I've re-read your notes on Lesbos. Is too similar to a Febbro one. You been sending that stuff to him? What do I do If he asks? Strange... Daddy. That's Hosni's office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While we talked, all I could think of was that I had been in Palestine for 2 days and nothing had happened. Absolutely nothing. That's Jerusalem Gate, in the middle of Palestine. I was said Israeli soldiers arrived there every afternoon, for weeks. To evict the Palestinians who had settled down when they found settlers measuring the land for a new settlement. In only five days, I could relate to two different groups of kids, Israelis and Palestinians, on either side. I could never relate to someone less than 10 years old But we were the same. Talking as equals. We all were politized and brainwashed young guys. Although they didn't know that I was... ...jewish. Finally... The soldiers arrived... This was the front. This was the frontline. The soldiers were ready to evict the Palestinians and ourselves. This is what my father calls "the geopolitical boiler of the World". We were scared. For Nur and Ahmed, this was common. We didn't understand if we were in shock for the Palestinian cause, or for the way of life in the other side of the world, and being inside the news we read in the newspapers. When we realized this was not news, but the everyday life, We left. Let's go to Lebanon. No. Libya. We'll stay here. Kazakhstan? It has nothing to do with this. Qatar? No, we'll stay here. Nigeria? Will your mum pay for it? Venezuela? No. Then we should just go back. No, please. No. Russia? Let's go to Russia! Are you insane? What for? Well, if you don't want to go back, we'll stay. Well... Is obvious this is not the Moon. It's the Dead Sea. Not in Israel, nor in Palestine. It is believed that here a Kingdom ended and an Empire began. And that is not a journalist. Neither a director. It's an actor.
