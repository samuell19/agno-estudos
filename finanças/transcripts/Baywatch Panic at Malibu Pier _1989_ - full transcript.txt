MY FRIENDS ARE EXPECTING ME. -YOU'RE NOT HANGING OUT TODAY, YOU'RE WORKING. TOWER 27 IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE SAND AND SEA CLUB. THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN LIFEGUARD, BUT WE KIND OF WATCH HIS WATER. -THEN HE DOESN'T EXIST. -FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES. ALSO REMEMBER, KEEP AN EYE ON THE RESCUE CAN ON THE TOWER NEXT TO YOU. IF IT'S MISSING, YOU'D BETTER FIND OUT WHERE THE LIFEGUARD IS. -YOU GOT IT. -YOU ARE ON THE RESCUE BOAT WITH JILL HERE. -ON A BOAT? -OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, LIEUTENANT. -I DO NOT WANT TO BE STUCK OUT ON A BOAT ALL DAY. -AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE SUIT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? THEY SAID GIRLS GET TO BUY THEIR OWN SUITS. -YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO LIFEGUARD PATCH ON IT. YOU GOT AN EXTRA ONE, DON'T YOU? -I CAN SEW THE PATCH ON THIS ONE. -WHERE? -I'M SURE THERE'S SOME SWIM SUITS IN THE LOCKER ROOM. -SHAUNI, COME HERE FOR A SECOND. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BE PUT IN A TOWER, I'LL PUT YOU IN ONE, DON'T WORRY. -SORRY I TOOK SO LONG. OUR DRYER HAS ONE SETTING, TUMBLE SLOW. -THANK YOU.

BEING CRAMPED IN A TOWER ALL DAY DOESN'T REALLY SUIT MY STYLE ANYWAY. SEE YOU, I'M BEST LEFT UNTETHERED TO STRUT THE BEACH, PUT PEOPLE AT THEIR EASE. -"STRUT THE BEACH"? -WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY POINT.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -LOCKED YOURSELF OUT? -[GRUNTS] UH, NO, I WAS JUST-- IT DOESN'T MATTER. -YEAH. -WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHERE'S HOBIE? -WELL, THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE TO ASK YOU. WHEN I WENT BY SCHOOL TO PICK HIM UP, THEY SAID THAT HE'D SNUCK OUT, AND SO NATURALLY-- -NATURALLY, YOU CAME HERE. COME ON, HE'S PROBABLY AT TOWER 25. YOU KNOW, GAYLE, IT'S NOT EASY FOR HOBIE, IT'S SUMMER. -JUST, PLEASE, DON'T MAKE ANY EXCUSES FOR HIM. -I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM, I'M JUST TELLING YOU. -LOOK, MITCH, THIS IS JUST NOT WORKING. -WHAT'S NOT WORKING? THE DIVORCE? [LAUGHS] 'CAUSE OUR MARRIAGE SUDDENLY DOESN'T WORK OUT-- -NO, IT'S JUST THIS JOINT CUSTODY THING WITH HOBIE. HE'S BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. MITCH, I JUST, I REALLY THINK THAT HE'D BE BETTER OFF IF HE LIVED WITH ME FULL TIME. -NO WAY. -HE COULD VISIT YOU EVERY OTHER WEEKEND. -YOU CAN FORGET IT. -CAN YOU JUST PUT YOUR OWN FEELINGS ASIDE FOR ONCE AND THINK ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR SON? I AM. I ALWAYS DO. YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE WITH ME MORE THAN HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU. -WELL, OF COURSE HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU. I MEAN, WHAT KID WOULDN'T? A BLOCK FROM THE OCEAN, A FATHER WHO SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES. HEY, YOU'RE HIS HERO, AND I'M JUST THE OGRE WHO MAKES HIM STAY IN HIS BEDROOM DOING HIS HOMEWORK OVER UNTIL IT'S NEAT. I MEAN, WITH YOU, LIFE'S A BEACH, WHY SHOULD HE EVER WANT TO LEAVE? -YOU LEFT. -MITCH, IT'S TOO LATE FOR US, BUT NOT FOR HOBIE. WHAT HE NEEDS NOW IS CONSISTENCY. -YOU WANT CONSISTENCY, I'LL LET HIM VISIT YOU EVERY OTHER WEEKEND. -IF HOBIE LIVES WITH ME, HE'LL HAVE A WHOLE WORLD FULL OF CHOICES. WITH YOU, ALL HE'S EVER GOING TO WANT TO BE IS A LIFE GUARD JUST LIKE HIS DAD-- -I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE STILL HAVING THIS DAMN ARGUMENT. NOW, LIFEGUARDS ARE TEACHERS AND DOCTORS. CRAIG'S AN ATTORNEY, FOR GOD'S SAKE. -YES, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE LIKE THEM. HE WANTS TO BE LIKE YOU. -GAYLE, I MADE A CAREER MOVE, YOU KNOW? I'M MAKING A LIEUTENANT'S SALARY PLUS OVERTIME NOW. -MONEY HAS NEVER BEEN THE ISSUE. -LOOK. THERE'S JUST-- THERE'S NO POINT IN US ARGUING ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. I'VE SEEN AN ATTORNEY, MITCH. I'M FILING FOR FULL CUSTODY, I'M SORRY. -YOU LOVED ME ONCE. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME? -I'M DOING IT FOR HOBIE. AND IF YOU REALLY LOVE HIM, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY. WAIT. LET ME TAKE HIM HOME. [SOFT MUSIC] -HI. -NOW I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY OTHER KEY. -IT'S COZY IN HERE. IT'S LIKE YOUR OWN LITTLE BEACH HOUSE. -WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS, LAURIE? -I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU SAVE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYONE'S EVER SAVED ME. IT'S NOT 50 BONUS POINTS... BUT THERE'S A POEM IN THERE THAT'S ALL ABOUT US. IT SAYS, "HE BRAVELY RISKED HIS SOUL TO SAVE HER LIFE." -LAURIE I APPRECIATE THIS, THANK YOU. DON'T SAY "BUT." PLEASE DON'T. PEOPLE ALWAYS START TO SAY NICE THINGS AND THEY TAKE IT AWAY WITH "BUT." -DRINKING'S NOT ALLOWED ON THE BEACH. I HAVE TO CLOSE MY TOWER. -DO YOU EVER STAY HERE AFTER IT GETS DARK? -SOMETIMES. LAURIE: BY YOURSELF? -IT DEPENDS. -SO DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? -A WIFE. -OH. WHAT'S HER NAME? -GINA. -LET ME GUESS, YOU SAVED HER LIFE AND SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU. -NO, NO, THOSE INFATUATIONS BURN OUT REAL FAST. I WAS CROSS EXAMINING HER IN COURT IN NEW YORK. SHE WAS THE ONE WITNESS I COULDN'T TRIP UP OR PIN DOWN, SO I MARRIED HER. -I HATE THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN YOU CARRIED ME OUT OF THE WATER. -WELL, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WHEN YOU-- LAURIE, WHY WERE YOU BALANCING ON THE END OF THE PIER THIS MORNING? -I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE JUST SO I COULD MEET YOU. KISS ME AGAIN LIKE YOU DID THIS MORNING. -THAT WASN'T A KISS. -OUR LIPS TOUCHED. -I'VE HAD TO DO THAT WITH TWO-HUNDRED-POUND DOCK WORKERS. -YOU JUST THINK I'M TOO YOUNG. WELL, I'M NOT TOO YOUNG. -LAURIE, PUT THAT BACK ON. STAY HERE. OWEN. LOOK, IT'S SOME KIND OF VICTIM FIXATION. I'M SURE IT'S HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE. -NO. GREAT. LOOK, I'LL WALK BACK AFTER I DEAL WITH THIS. -ANYTHING YOU SAY, PERRY MASON. -RIGHT. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [SHOWER FALLING DOWN] -[SOBS] JILL: SHAUNI. -JILL, I'M REALLY SORRY. JILL: HEY, IT'S OKAY. DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP. NEXT TIME YOU'LL HANDLE IT. -WHEN I WAS HOLDING THAT LITTLE GIRL, I JUST KEPT FEELING HER LIFE SLIPPING. AND I COULDN'T MOVE. -NO ONE SAID THE JOB WOULD BE ALL FUN IN THE SUN. COME ON, SIT DOWN. -[SOBS] SHAUNI, THE FIRST TIME I HELD A VICTIM IN MY ARMS, IT SENT A CHILL THROUGH ME THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW COLD THE WATER WAS. BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I KNEW, REALLY KNEW THAT I WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY LIVING OR DYING. YOU KNOW, AS FRIGHTENED AS I WAS, IT WAS THE GREATEST THING I'VE EVER FELT. -BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T HANDLE IT? JILL: YOU WILL. BUT UNTIL THEN, THERE'LL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE HERE TO BACK YOU UP, OKAY? -[SIGHS] -I DON'T THINK I CAN GO BACK OUT THERE AND FACE THEM. -HEY, LOOK, NOBODY HAS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. OKAY? COME ON, WE'LL GO TO MITCH'S PARTY TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT? -OKAY. MITCH: LISTEN IF SHE HAS ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS, YOU JUST GIVE US A RING, AND WE'LL SEND SOMEBODY UP THERE TO TALK TO HER. -BUSY, BUSY. -YEAH, THE GUYS DID A GOOD JOB TODAY. -I SEE YOU'RE STILL ONE OF THE GUYS. -THE UNIFORM DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT, DOES IT? -YES, IT DOES, MITCH. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN COORDINATING THE BLITZ FROM YOUR UNIT, CALLING THE SHOTS, NOT MAKING THE RESCUE. I DON'T SEE A CARD FOR AL IN HERE. IS THAT WHY YOU GOT WET, COVERING FOR HIM? -AL WAS IN THE WATER. -BUT HE DIDN'T PULL ANYONE OUT. -NO, HE DIDN'T PULL ANYONE OUT, BUT HE KEPT ONE OF MY ROOKIES FROM BEING DRAGGED DOWN. -MITCH, I KNOW THAT AL IS SOMETHING LIKE A FATHER-- -AL MAKES PREVENTIONS BEFORE OTHER LIFEGUARDS EVEN NOTICE THERE'S A PROBLEM. CAPTAIN: HE'S PAST HIS PRIME, MITCH. I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO FIRE HIM, BUT UNTIL MANDATORY RETIREMENT, I WANT HIM OFF THE SAND. -CAPTAIN, IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF TEST TO SEE IF I FOLLOW ORDERS-- -YOU SAID YOU UNDERSTAND CHAIN OF COMMAND, MITCH, SO I DON'T NEED TO TEST YOU, DO I? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] AL? HEY, AL? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] AL? AL? PICASSO, HOW YOU DOING? -HEY, MITCH, COME ON IN. YOU CAN HELP ME PAINT ALL THE FISH I LEFT BLANK. -YOU SURE YOU WANT TO RISK IT? -NEVER MIND THAT, JUST PAINT YOUR INSTINCTS. -ALL RIGHT. -I SAW YOU, GAYLE AND HOBIE TODAY. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? -GAYLE'S FILING FOR FULL CUSTODY. -WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? -I'M GOING TO GET CRAIG TO REPRESENT ME AND FIGHT HER IN COURT IF I HAVE TO. -OH, GOD. -HEY. IS THIS WHAT THE BAY LOOKED LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT? -YEAH. HELL, I WAS 17. I USED TO PADDLE OUT ON MY LONG BOARD, TAKE A COUPLE OF DEEP BREATHS, FREE DIVE TWO OR THREE MINUTES. LIKE ETERNITY. LIKE I WAS IN LIQUID HEAVEN. AND THEN I WOULD BRING UP SOME FRESH AIR FOR DINNER. -[LAUGHS] I JUST HOPE SOMEDAY WE DON'T HAVE TO PAINT LITTLE OIL WELLS OUT HERE AND MAYBE THE WATER A MURKY ORANGE, HUH? -WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MITCH. BETTER START PROTECTING THE GREAT LADY. SHE'S GOING TO RUN OUT ON US. WE SURE AS HELL ARE GOING TO MISS HER WHEN SHE'S GONE. SEE, THE GREAT LADY'S ALWAYS BEEN MY MISTRESS. LISTEN, HOW ABOUT LETTING ME TAKE HOBIE FISHING TOMORROW? I CAN TALK TO HIM. THIS CUSTODY STUFF CAN BE PRETTY ROUGH ON A KID, YOU KNOW. I'LL BE BACK IN PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK MY TOWER. -THAT'S GREAT, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO GAYLE ABOUT IT. HE'S WITH HER THIS WEEKEND. -THAT'S GOOD, I WANT TO TALK TO HER. BUT WE'D BETTER GET GOING RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MISS YOUR PARTY. -YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING... I HAD THIS BRILLIANT IDEA THIS MORNING. WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU COME OFF THE BEACH AND HELP ME RUN THINGS? THE TWO OF US TOGETHER, WE COULD REALLY MAKE BAYWATCH HUM. -NO, MITCH. YOU SEE, I NEED TO HAVE BOTH MY FEET IN THE SAND. THIS ISN'T A FRIENDLY OFFER, THOUGH, IS IT? CAPTAIN THORPE? -YEAH, CAPTAIN THORPE. AL, I'M SORRY, I TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT. -MITCH, DON'T PUT THIS LOAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. REMEMBER THAT. THE ONLY REASON THAT YOU GOT WET TODAY WAS BECAUSE I WAS LATE GETTING THERE. [SOFT MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] -THINK EDDIE'D GET BORED JUST SWIMMING BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT. -YEAH, YOU'D THINK SHE'D GET BORED WATCHING LIKE THAT. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [SENSUAL MUSIC] -[SIGHS] HI. YOU AREN'T LEAVING, ARE YOU? -YEAH, I'M JUST NOT MUCH FOR PARTIES. -OH, COME ON, COME DANCE WITH ME. I GUARANTEE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME. -IT'S ALL YOU CALIFORNIA GIRLS THINK ABOUT, HUH? HAVING A GOOD TIME. -WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN BROODING OFF BY YOURSELF. YOU ALL RIGHT? -WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO YOU TODAY, HUH? SAVING THAT LITTLE GIRL? -I DON'T KNOW, YOU SAVED HER. I JUST, UM, TRIED TO HELP. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO YOU? -MIXED UP. LIKE I WAS THE VICTIM GRABBING ON TO HER TO SAVE ME. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -DOESN'T MATTER. -YOU CAN TELL ME. -WHY DOES EVERYONE AROUND HERE THINK BECAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY? I DON'T NEED ANOTHER FAMILY, OKAY? -OKAY. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO KNOW. -HI. -HI. -HOW ARE YOU DOING? -FINE, THANKS. -CAN I USE YOUR BLUSH? -YEAH, SURE. IT MAY BE A LITTLE DARK FOR YOU. -THAT'S OKAY, THANKS. I LIKE DARK. IT'S A WILD PARTY, HUH? -OH, YEAH, THEY ALWAYS ARE. -DON'T YOU JUST LOVE LIFEGUARDS? THEY'RE SO HEROIC. ONE OF THEM SAVED MY LIFE TODAY. -REALLY? -IT WAS REALLY ROMANTIC. -ROMANTIC? -I STOOD BY HIS TOWER ALL DAY. AND THEN AT SUNSET HE TOOK ME INSIDE. HE TOLD ME IF I HAD DROWNED, HE WOULD'VE NEVER FORGIVEN HIMSELF. AND THEN HE KISSED ME. WE MADE LOVE RIGHT THERE IN HIS TOWER. WITH THE SOUND OF THE WAVES AND THE SEAGULLS. IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL. -[GASPS] [SIGHS] -I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM SINCE I GOT HERE, BUT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT'S HIM. CRAIG. HI, HONEY, SORRY I'M LATE. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. -OH, HEY, HEY, LAURIE. THIS IS GINA. -OH, I KNOW, WE MET. -YES, LAURIE'S BEEN TELLING ME ALL ABOUT THE ROMANTIC DAY SHE'S HAD. -WHAT'S WRONG? -WHAT'S WRONG IS THAT I HAPPEN TO BE YOUR HERO'S WIFE. -WHAT? -THIS IS GINA. I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER. -YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE COME HERE AND EMBARRASSED MYSELF IF I KNEW YOU HAD A WIFE? -GINA, WHAT HAS SHE BEEN SAYING? -I'D LIKE TO GO NOW. -WHAT DID SHE-- GINA: NOW, PLEASE. -CRAIG I TOLD HER ABOUT SUNSET IN YOUR TOWER. HOW WE MADE LOVE. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW. -OH, GOD. -GINA, SHE'S LYING. SHE'S MAKING THIS UP. -CRAIG, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME. -DAMN IT, NOW STOP IT. NOTHING HAPPENED BETWEEN US, AND YOU KNOW IT. -HE SAW US. HE DROVE UP IN HIS TRUCK. ASK HIM IF I'M LYING. [TENSE MUSIC] -GINA! [OMINOUS MUSIC] -GINA, THIS IS CRAZY. I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE OWEN AND THAT GIRL. -I JUST WANT TO SLEEP, CRAIG. -AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MORNING? -I DON'T KNOW. -GINA-- [PHONE RINGING] HELLO? LAURIE: CRAIG, I NEED TO SEE YOU. -OH, LAURIE, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? LAURIE: I'LL BE AT YOUR TOWER. IF YOU DON'T COME, YOU'LL FIND ME THERE IN THE MORNING. AND IT'LL BE TOO LATE TO SAVE ME THIS TIME. [CALL CUTS OFF] -SHE SAYS IF I DON'T MEET HER AT MY TOWER RIGHT NOW, SHE'S GOING TO KILL HERSELF. -THEN DON'T GO. -SHE'S A TROUBLED GIRL. SHE OBVIOUSLY TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE TODAY, AND I MISREAD IT. -THEN CALL THE POLICE. CALL SUICIDE PREVENTION, HAVE THEM PICK HER UP. -AS SOON AS I KNOW SHE'S SAFE. -CRAIG. -WHAT? WHAT IS IT? -IF YOU'RE GOING, I'M GOING WITH YOU. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] LAURIE? LAURIE. -DON'T HURT ME, PLEASE. -NO ONE'S GOING TO HURT YOU. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME, WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR PARENTS. -NO, PLEASE, DON'T TAKE ME BACK THERE. -HOW DID YOU GET THESE BRUISES ON YOUR NECK? WHAT HAPPENED? GINA: WHO DID THAT TO YOU? -SOMEONE AT THE PARTY? -I LEFT AFTER YOU DID. CRAIG: WHERE DID YOU GO? UH... I WENT HOME. -IS THAT WHERE THIS HAPPENED, AT HOME? -LAURIE, TELL US WHO DID THIS TO YOU AND WE'LL HELP YOU, I PROMISE. -NO, HE'LL HURT ME. GINA: WHO? WHO WILL HURT YOU? -IS IT YOUR FATHER? -[SOBS] [CRIES] I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET IN BED WITH ME AGAIN. -LAURIE, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK TO OUR HOUSE TONIGHT. -NO ONE EVER CARED IF I LIVED OR DIED BEFORE. I'M REALLY SORRY. -YEAH, THAT'S IT. I WILL. THANKS. HOW IS SHE? -ASLEEP. -I GOT HER ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER FROM THE RESCUE CARD. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? -[SIGHS] MY HEART'S POUNDING. MY PALMS ARE SWEATING, MY BRAIN IS NUMB, THANK GOD. THAT POOR KID, I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE FANTASIZED. I HAD THIS FRIEND WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. HER STEP FATHER MOLESTED HER FROM THE TIME SHE WAS... [SIGHS] 11, ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. I NEVER EVEN KNEW UNTIL SHE SWALLOWED A BOTTLE OF PILLS. I KEPT THINKING IF I'D BEEN MORE SENSITIVE OR A BETTER FRIEND, I COULD'VE DONE SOMETHING. -YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING NOW FOR LAURIE. -I WANT TO DO MORE, I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN. -YOU SEE, YOU'RE A LIFEGUARD TOO AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT. -SHOULD WE CALL HER PARENTS OR-- -I WANT TO JUST GO THERE IN THE MORNING UNANNOUNCED.

[OMINOUS MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [SEAGULLS SCREAMING] -SHOULDN'T WE HAVE BROUGHT SOME SANDWICHES OR SOMETHING? -SANDWICHES? FISHERMEN CATCH THEIR LUNCH.

HELP ME, GINA. -OKAY. -THE HOMELESS SLEEP UNDER HERE AT NIGHT. -CAN'T WE JUST BURN THE LETTER BY THE SHORE AND LET THE ASHES WASH OUT TO SEA? -[LAUGHS] I DID THAT WITH A LETTER TO MY FATHER ONCE. IT DIDN'T WORK. THIS IS THE WAY IN. -LAURIE, NO, I'M NOT GOING IN THERE. -YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME BURY IT. -WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD SEE YOUR THERAPIST BEFORE WE DO THIS. -YOU'RE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
