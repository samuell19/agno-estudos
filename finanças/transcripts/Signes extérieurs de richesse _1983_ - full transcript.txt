STATUS SYMBOLS What about Jean-Jacques Lestrade? Born on June 6th, 1938. He moved here in 1971, declared 730,262 francs in income, owns an expensive car, got divorced in '81 and pays 10,000 francs in monthly alimony. Why not Morin? He seems great. Annual income: 120,430 francs, a boat of more than 40 tons. I find Morin sexier. -So, Morin or Lestrade? -Why not both? No, there's only room for one. That's a shame. I liked them both. Look, let's cut to the chase. Tails is Lestrade, and heads is Morin. Lestrade. How can he focus with what's going on? That was lucky. Well, he does need a bit of luck these days. Your turn, gentlemen. Shit! I know what you're thinking! I don't want to play! This IRS stuff is getting to me. You're not the one who's getting audited. If you don't mind, gentlemen, can I play now? It's true, though. You're being a pain in the ass. You can't go golfing when you're getting audited. How dumb is he? We risk far more than he does. You're unconscious! You know what'll happen to you? I have nothing to worry about. I can look myself in the mirror. I don't cheat. I'm not like you guys. Are you nuts? Not so loud! -Nobody's around. -What about those guys? Oh, come on... By the way, did you treat Balestier's dog? -I did, six months ago. Why? -I just needed to know. Did you know that Balestier is right-wing, RPR? Yeah, so what? -You treated his dog? -Yeah, a dachshund. Real small. Wait a minute. You're not saying that-- No, it's just a thought. Don't you find it strange? Treat a right-wing dog, get audited six months later. You guys owe me 200. -So, how did it go? -Very well. Very well? Did you talk to him? -Did he tell you what I'm risking? -Nothing at all. You're divorced. What could possibly happen to you? I'm so tired. I couldn't sleep last night. What about him? Is he worried? Him? Hello, everybody! Florence, there she is: the lady I divorced two years ago. Brigitte, my fiancée as of two hours ago. Hello. They're here 'cause it's cheaper than the clubhouse. How are the Bianchis doing? Hello. How are you? Hello. No champagne? On a day like this? Can I? You haven't moved them, have you? All right. I'll go. By the way, it's true. -You know what's going on? -I do. No you don't. I scored a 90. I got 200 out of it. Bang! -He's very joyful. -Very. When I see him like this, he scares me. There you go. -Red wine? -We're waiting for the champagne. Well, I'll have some. I don't understand. -Whose house is this? -It's JJ's house. I mean, it used to be. His wife lives here now. Alone. I mean, not quite. Hello, ladies and gents. There you go! And it's not the only thing we're celebrating. I don't know if you're aware yet, but I got it. -I got my first audit. -Yeah, right. She couldn't sleep last night. Come on! Just because of my audit? What's an audit? Oh my! It's a marvelous thing that can change your life. -Shall I, Doctor? -No, thanks. For instance, you can have a nice gas-guzzling car, you can't find a place to park it, and you end up riding a moped. Thank you, IRS. Or you have a nice crib like this one, and you end up living in a tiny apartment. Right, darling? No garden to worry about, no swimming pool to empty... Thank you, IRS. Wouldn't you like to go live in a tiny apartment like we used to? You're wrong, you know. It would make you feel younger. Zi zoo za. Good old JJ! I'm being serious! No more local taxes. No more worries. You can walk down the street and start panhandling. Thanks a lot. Come on Bianchi, dig into your wallet. You cheapskate. Mr. Fabius will make it up to you. Thanks for the Swedish perspective. -Are you happy now? -What did I do? -You're so self-centered. -I am. -Why wouldn't I be? -You don't know these IRS guys. They'll take everything from you. Everything. You think you've never done anything wrong. Did you write down all the details for all the mutts? Do you include all the drugs in your bills? You idiot. There you go. That's nice. Sacha Guitry once said that stairs are the best part of love. -What's going on? -Wait here. Manuel? Go ahead. Don't be afraid. There you go. Manuel? Yes, Jacques? How many times have I asked you to fix it? Yes, Jacques. -Manuel? -Yes, Jacques? Couldn't you have lit the fire before I got back? It's too late now. Can I look around? Yes, my dear, knock yourself out. Make yourself comfortable. You know what I'm doing right now? I'm imagining you naked. I imagine nice, perky breasts... Oh... Damn. I can't wait to find out more. Those moments when our bodies hunger for one another, and yet we tell them: "Be patient." The more we wait for the inevitable, the better it will be. But why should it be inevitable? Perhaps you'll leave untouched? I doubt it. Perhaps I'll be left alone with the marvelous and throbbing memory of your perfume, like a wish that has yet to be granted? Why are you talking to yourself? What are you doing? Are you nuts? I fixed us some drinks and all... You did? OK. Don't stay like this. You'll catch a cold. Cover yourself up. Here. There you go. I love it when alcohol makes women's eyes shine. Would you happen to have a glass of milk instead? A glass of milk? No problem. Does it work? Oh this? Yes, yes. -With this? -Yes. -Show me how. -The other way around. -Oh, yes, right. -Like this. There you go! It's great to be loaded, right? Check this out. There you go. It's crazy, right? ...which is encouraging. He tells us why. I think there are three reasons. The first one is a question of political will. We'll bring the hammer down on tax evaders, because that's akin to stealing from France, and political will is important. The second reason is about fixing the loopholes. Shady individuals were able to slither through the cracks. JÉRÔME BOUVIER ACCOUNTANT Daddy isn't here, and Mommy is sick! When does your dad get back? Daddy isn't here, and Mommy is sick! I got that. When does he get back? It's Dr. Lestrade. -Is that you? -Yes, it's me. -What's going on? -I'm getting audited. Wow. What do you mean, "wow"? Nothing at all. I've been trying to call you for two hours. We just forgot to pay our bill. What can I do for you? I don't know, Jérôme. I'd like you to make me feel better. Didn't you catch Fabius on the TV? I was listening to Beethoven. I mean... I can't let you in right now. Give me a minute. I'll be right back. You keep saying "Daddy isn't here, and Mommy is sick!" But Daddy is here. It's because of the auditors. The auditors. OK, let's go. Daddy isn't here, and Mommy is sick! It's me, you idiot! -Hello, Mr. Bouvier. -Good evening. -My bottle and two glasses. -Right away, sir. I'll just have a glass of water. -Good evening, Mr. Bouvier. -Good evening. This is Dr. Lestrade, the best vet in Paris. And he's my client too. -Hello. -Nice to meet you, sir. Shall I plug it in, Mr. Bouvier? Do you have 20 francs? I do, why? Come here. We didn't come here to play pinball. You're asking, so let me explain it to you. -See this ball? -Yeah. Imagine that's our auditor who meddles in our business. Every time he digs in, and he finds something we can't justify, you pay up. You think it's over, but it isn't. The guy comes back, and it starts over. If he suspects a cover up or fraud, you pay triple. We're like that target up there. See it? He's looking to light us up. But I'll put the nine down and carry over the one. But you know I don't cheat, so-- Indeed, we do not cheat, JJ. But we still need to prove it. What do you mean? Don't worry. We'll fight tooth and nail. You'll pay up, 'cause that's always the outcome, but we'll fight. In that case, let's drink to our IRS drones! Oh, no! We don't use that term. We use the term "auditors". Why? We say: "Mr. Auditor". Hello. Someone's on the phone for you. I'm coming. -I'll be downstairs. -All right, I'm coming down. Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine. I swear. No, I don't know what I'll be wearing. The blue dress? -Nothing serious? -No, no. What blue dress? Oh, yeah, the one with the pockets on the front. No, it doesn't make me feel better. He's a veterinarian. I don't know that yet. I'll know once I've checked his books. This is for you. Why would you care whether or not he committed tax fraud? I don't know yet, and I'm not allowed to tell you. I can't tell Dad either. If he is a fraud, I'll notify him about the adjustment. A fine, yeah. Several million, perhaps. Why not? Did you hear that? No, he's not the only one. I also have a restaurant owner. Listen, Mom, I gotta go. Love you. No, I can't hog the phone line. Yes, I will. All right. Goodbye. Thank you. -Sorry it took so long. -No problem. Don't worry, I know the way. Thank you, bye. Bravo, bravo. One word: bravo. How could I know? I didn't know she was an auditor. There are so many minority students looking for a room, but you had to rent ours to an auditor. Now we'll have to declare her rent. PARKED FOR DELIVERY VETERINARY CLINIC He'll be here soon. -What's going on? -What? What do you mean? Don't tell me you forgot! I did, though. -No way! -I did. I swear. Where do you plan to set him up? You have to give him a room with a table and a chair. I was thinking of this room. Make it work. Do you want to get us slaughtered? -You want to get us slaughtered? -What now? You know how much room we have here. Where the heck do you want me to put him? We have 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes to turn this dump into a palace. All right, short notice, but... Look at this. We can't even fix him a drink. An ashtray. You could've gotten some cigarettes for him. I mean, look at this. I could send Thérèse to buy some. Can you get me some cigarettes, snacks, and drinks? Take the money from the cash register. Let's go. I don't need that anymore. And that's not all. We can't have a crowded waiting room. Why not? We don't want to make the guy's job easier. He'll count your clients and multiply that by the days you're open. He'll just have to do the math. You're making it easy. What do we do? Shall we finish the anesthesia or let her die? No, go ahead. I can't get rid of them. Come on, Doctor. -Hello, ladies. -Hello, Doctor. I'm sorry, but I can't see anyone this morning. Please. The doctor needs to perform a very delicate operation, so please bear with us. No need to insist. It won't work. Well, I won't be coming back. Come on, ladies. -I had an appointment. -Everyone had one, lady. All these poor creatures that'll be left untreated. Now we're ready for him. -Béatrice Flamand. -Sorry, miss. I'm the auditor. Since I didn't know what the guy likes, I also bought a bottle of Martini and a bunch of stuff, like these Tiparillo cigars. I... Did I do something wrong? I hope you love animals. You'll never feel alone here. I guess you know how a modest clinic like ours operates. -No, I don't. -You don't? I'm here to explain everything. You'll see, it's not that simple. And it's not that complicated either. It's special. Don't you believe that each occupation has its own accounting style? No. Well, you're not the type to mince words. I'll tell you something: I love it. We'll need to drown them, Doctor. They don't look like purebreds. There's no way I'm keeping them. There you go. I'm afraid we won't get along with our auditor. What's the matter? All the stuff I gave her still isn't enough. He's right. I thought it would've been more than enough. There is no cashbook. Is that so important? It is, and there is no bank book either. I keep telling her it's the same thing. Seriously, what do you want us to do? Thanks. We don't want you to be unhappy. I'll come back later. Give me this. Thank you. Do you want to keep one? The lady doesn't want them. She wants them killed. We're not allowed to keep them. No, thank you. I'll be in touch. Maybe we can start caring for our animals, now... They sent us a woman. They're the worst. Didn't even flinch when you mentioned killing the pups. She's such a Nazi. It sends shivers up my spine. What's with all the books she wants from us? What do I know? If you listen to these IRS people, it's never enough. -I find it a bit-- -Look, JJ, if you're going to play along-- I'm not playing along, but I'd like to know how it went with your other ones. What other ones? Your other audits, Jérôme. It's my first. I've always managed to elude them. I'm all about prevention. You must've jinxed me. -You're a certified accountant, huh? -Hold on. I never told you I was certified. I said I'm certainly an accountant. -You must have some sort of degree. -No. I'm self-taught. If you don't like it, I'm out of here. You gotta choose between that Nazi lady and me. Get out. Whether it's you or somebody else won't change much. Oh, come on. How was it? -Is the rum for you? -Oh, yes. Thank you. They must've thought I'm some kind of idiot. I didn't know what to say. I could only say "yes" and "no". The words wouldn't come out. I was feeling weak in the knees. I'm so glad you're here. So, what does he look like? I don't know. I wouldn't dare look at him. -No? -I was... Come on. Have you ever thought about getting a dog? Oh, no. I think dogs aren't allowed in the building. -Oh, yeah? -Why? They have two puppies at the clinic. They're adorable. -Oh yeah? -They're so cute. Why don't you take one? I can't. If I do, it'll look like I accepted a gift. Right. I've already seen your veterinarian. -I'm sure. Look. -Look at the doggy. You did tell him the dog was for you, right? -Of course. -Thank you. Eat. I'll find him for you. Aren't you going to eat a bit? -I'll give you a hand. -Where did Mommy put it? There. Here we are. Give him full-fat milk. It's closer to breast milk. -There you go. -Thanks. You're great. Don't be silly! This isn't for you. You're too old for this. -Poor thing. -He's so upset. Come on, come on. I know! Hold him. But... Jean-François, Mommy's coming back. Mommy's coming back. Don't cry. Stop crying. Hit him. It's the only thing that works. Hey, look at this. A clown nose. Hey, -is that him? -Yes. He's always with beautiful girls. Come here. I knew it. At first, I thought I'd seen him in the tabloids, but it turns out... Eat this. So, what do you think of him? -He looks better here. -So you did look at him. -You're so lucky. -Why? Because I'm stuck with my kids here, and you get to hang out with guys like him who know how to talk to women and take them out to eat. Tell me... What would you do if he hit on you? It must be Gérard. It's Gérard. Thanks. I mean it. Thanks for everything. -You won't mention the dog, right? -I won't. He goes to the owners' meetings. Hello. Hello. She's... expecting. Excellent. Congrats. It'll add to your tax burden. All right, I'm off. I did notice that you were a bit-- Hey! Keep me posted, huh? Bye. Come here, little doggy. Come here, Sébastien. There you go. Come with me. Follow me. Good doggy. Sorry. You wanted to take a picture? My doggy's really young, that's why. I wiped it all up. Nothing to worry about. I wiped it all up. Sébastien, come back! -Let's take a picture. -No, my hair's really bad. Hey. -It's her dog. -It's her dog. Miss! Your pictures. Thanks. That's my dog. Thanks. Hello, sir. I have an appointment with Mr. Gino Caprioni. That would be me. Béatrice Flamand, IRS auditor. I was expecting you. Do you want anything to drink? No, thanks. -Would you follow me? -Yes. This is my office. I hope you'll like it. It will do. You have all the bank books, the cash books, the checkbooks, the invoices from our suppliers. If you need anything else... Dr. Lestrade's clinic. How can I help you? I don't think that will be possible. Later in the morning? No. I'm telling you his appointment book is full. What about Thursday or Friday afternoon? Can't do. The doctor is very busy, you know? The only slot we have is at the end of the workday, when he's done. All right. So Friday, then. Thank you. Goodbye. Aren't you a bit harsh with your taxpayers? -You think so? -No, I was just kidding. I hope your vet isn't going to claim he never has any clients. I know I'd check his appointment book. Bandage it up. You let her into my apartment? Are you out of your mind? I didn't know. Look at what happens every time we have someone here. You shitbag! Oh, right. She also asked me for the appointment book. I think she wanted to check it. I don't like this. Sorry. Sorry. Good evening. So, Manuel, is she here? Yes, Jacques. -Dammit, Manuel! -Yes, Jacques. -The timer, goddammit! -Yes, Jacques. Sorry, I'm late. I've been extremely busy lately. Sorry. We can't see anything. This idiot Manuel lit a fire in the middle of summer. It's grotesque. But there is a rational explanation to it. My mother's coming for dinner. And Manuel loves my mother. He loves her, and she's very sensitive to cold, so he-- Anyway, go ahead, have a seat. -Fancy a drink? -No, thanks. Oh, you have heartburn? Like me? Give me a minute. I need to change. There. Let me inform you that, due to a lack of proper accounting, I will have to perform a CATS. A what? A Comprehensive Audit of your Tax Situation. Oh, a CATS. "Comprehensive..." Well, well, well. What does it consist of? All bank statements and check stubs from the past five years. Why? To check that your lifestyle does not exceed your tax returns. Oh, right. Where can I find all this? Excuse me. By the way, your accountant told me he no longer works for you. -Who do I have to deal with? -With me. Since we'll be working together, we might as well get along. So what's your first name? -Béatrice. -Great. I'm JJ. Sorry. Don't be afraid. You were about to sit on the remote. Seriously, let's not act like enemies. Listen... -Shit. -Turn the light back on. -It wasn't me. You saw it. -Turn it back on. Goddammit. What a load of shit! Come on, it's just a power outage. Come on. Miss! Miss! Who do you think you are? I mean, look at you! You cow! You cow! Yes, she's not that beautiful. -It's all your fault. Shut up. -Yes, Jacques. -Béatrice? It's Sylvie. -Yes. I have something on the stove. So? How was he? Great. He called me a cow, but he's great. No way! -And what did you reply? -Nothing. I just left. Who does he think he is? Just because he's in the papers. What are you gonna do? Nothing. I'll just keep going. Come on, girl! I hope you fight back, girl! You're a cow that's going to cost him an arm and a leg. Calm down, Sylvie. Calm down. That's not going to happen. You're going to rip him a new one. I bet he's shady. He looks like the shady type. You're getting carried away. -Let me see his books. -No. No, stop it. That's my job. It's none of your business. You're right. Anyway, I'm terrible at math. Gérard keeps making fun of me for that. Check this out. Eat this, you good boy. It's yummy. Hey. You must be starving too. I forgot about you. I need to go. See you later. Eat up. I'll never forget you, huh? -Are you here? -I am. My friend Bianchi told you about me? He did. -So you know I'm Dr. Lestrade? -No names! What's the auditor's name? Béatrice Flamand. Never heard of her. Must be new. Is that a bad thing? Could be. Do you have an approved management center? No. How much money is being covered up? Covered up? What cover up? Turn it up. You never know. -Like this? -Who's this? A customer, perhaps. The IRS knows white-collar professionals cheat, and you guys know that the administration knows. Starting with this premise, it's on. It's a system that has been satisfactory for both sides. And you claim to be a rebel who does not cheat, who does not play by the rules. Do you really think I'll buy that? What do you want me to tell you? I can't make it up. Your behavior is absurd. I can't help you. -Hey. Good evening. -Good evening. Let me help you. No, I'm good. -Are you kidding me? -It's not heavy at all. But you're pregnant. -You're sweet, but-- -It's heavy, huh? -No. -It's still full. -No, it isn't. -I'm not crazy. -It needs emptying. -No, it doesn't. -What's this? Is it yours? -Yes. -Is that what the bottles were for? -Yes. You didn't look that pregnant. -He's a good doggy, huh? -Yes. -I don't give a damn... -Yeah. -but the concierge does. -Yes. Thank you. That's so nice of you. Are you kidding me? By the way, I was going to ask you something. No, are you kidding me? So, my intention is not to cheat. I'm a good citizen. My taxes are based on an income of 11,700 francs a month. -Is there some kind of loophole? -No. -A little legal arrangement? -No. I can't think of anything. Let's go. So? I can't come up with something like that. Gimme a tip. Come on. Or I'll spill the beans on your stowaway. Look, I don't know. You're employed. -So, aside from a divorce... -What do you mean? It's simple. Your two kids only count for half a unit or one full unit for both kids. Whereas, if you were to divorce, one kid goes to you, the other to Sylvie, and they'd count as two units. That's one unit each. That's kind of neat. No, I'm OK. Thank you, and goodnight. How am I going to tell Sylvie? You can stay together. We rarely check. Hey, I could even give her alimony -and deduct it from my income. -You might as well. That's interesting. Very interesting. Hello, JJ. How are you? -How are you? -Good. We need to talk. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Are you alone? Yeah. You know, I got a call from our friend. You know who. Yeah. Tell me... Your suits, where do you hang them? You know, the suits I made you. In the closet. That closet? There they are. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I wouldn't want that chick to find me. I need to wall myself in, you know what I mean? The rat's deserting the sinking ship. Don't say that. You know we're still very good friends. You only think about yourself. -You told me you were alone. -I am. So who's the girl? She doesn't speak French. Do you want some coffee? Yeah, I'll have a cup. Look at that. Cashmere. Nobody does that anymore! Oh yeah? You've been unfaithful to me? You never told me you'd been to Zegna's. I'll let them have this one. At the end of the day, I envy you. What for? The audit? No, the girls, the parties, the champagne. It's wonderful. Yeah. Then again, you've already been married. And I keep paying for it, believe me. 10,000 a month. You're living the life. You're happy, you have nobody to answer to. Except for the IRS. Not bad for a bachelor's brew. I'm off. Good old JJ. Hold on. You forgot to wipe your fingerprints. Watch out. Daddy isn't here, and Mommy is sick! OK. It's Dr. Lestrade. Open up. The whole family's here. -Hi, Barbara? Is Jérôme here? -Yes. You killed him. Move over, guys. Get out of here. You wanted to see what you'd done? What the hell did I do? I wish you hadn't saved me in Algeria. Don't start. Good thing you saved my life. It's the only good thing you've ever done. I don't know why you won't admit it. Why am I here? Don't you realize you've ruined my reputation with my clients? You're so self-centered. I didn't fire you, though. You left. You told me to "get out of here". You know how proud I am. Are you coming back, yes or no? -No. -Yes, he is! You're going back. However, it won't be easy. -I called her a cow. -So what? Nowadays, it's not that bad an insult. She thought I was hitting on her. And? Flattery's always nice, huh? If she complains, we'll blame it on a punctilious bureaucracy. Barbara, get me my blue suit. What do you think? -Pretty nice, huh? -Yeah. -My blue suit had a stain. -Oh yeah? Nice fit. Mr. Lestrade, please. Let me do the talking. You've made enough of a mess. All right. Hello, Mr. Lestrade. You must be surprised to see me. I gave in to Dr. Lestrade's supplications. I took him back as a client. Let's see. I don't see any cash withdrawals on your bank account. -Do you never withdraw any cash? -Of course I do. On the bank account? Oh, no, never. Tell me how you pay for your everyday expenses, like the newspaper, for instance. We never buy the paper. We listen to the radio. -And your cigarettes? -I take the cash from the register. We take... But it's our right to do so. Of course. Your car, it's a... Jeep Cherokee. -Yes. -It never breaks down? I don't see any check payments to any shop. It's a very sturdy car. It was designed to go off-road, you know? Well, you still need gas, don't you? The builder's catalog says it guzzles up 17 to 22 liters every 100 kilometers on country roads and in towns. Let's say you drive 15,000km a year, one third on country roads, the rest in towns. At 3.50 francs a liter of gasoline over the past five years, it adds up to... 5,000km times 5, and 17 liters... So that's 4,250 times 3.50 francs, or 14,875 francs to start with, and then 10,000km times 5 at 22 liters per 100km and 3.50 francs a liter... which makes it... 42,350. So it adds up to 42,350 plus... equals 57,225. If I'm not mistaken. Does that money also come from the cash register? Did you say "25,000km"? -Two thirds in town. -One third. Two thirds. So, I... -Do we agree on that? -Yes. Yes. Does it come from the cash register? -Is it against the law? -It's not against the law, is it? No, no. Not a single check payment to a restaurant. Please. It's our right to eat our meals at home. It's our right to be homebodies. Absolutely. However, I noticed in this issue of Vogue-- Oh, come on now! What the hell is all this about? My client would like to know what this is all about. I'm sorry. Since there is no accounting whatsoever, -I'm obliged to-- -What? No accounting whatsoever? -No, no. -But I... I'll have to piece together your client's whereabouts. I don't know what you earn, so I'll figure out what you spend. Please don't ruin the magazine. I want to get reimbursed. Thank you. In this issue of Vogue, Jean-Jacques Lestrade is with Flore de Montessui and S. de Bourbonpré at Castel's. Is that you? Yes. So what? Well, I obtained a copy of the restaurant's menu, and three plates of caviar-- Who told you we had caviar? Look at the black specks in the plates. Do you mind? It could be red currants. -Red currants and toast? -An excellent dish. I was invited there. She's a friend. All right. I'll need a written confirmation. No checks for clothes shops. So, at the Palm Beach, you were decked out in a tuxedo. At the Martini, it was an alpaca suit. At the Avoriaz festival, a fur coat with leather frog fasteners. My tailor is rich. Is that how it's gonna be? Yes. Well. That's great. IRS OFFICE -Need a ride? -No, thanks. I'll take the metro. -I wanted to talk to you. -I have nothing to say. You don't, but I do. -Get an appointment. -No, it's not about the audit. I just want to set things straight. I want to talk man-to-man. I mean... I'm warning you. I'll jump into the canal. I'm in a hurry. You don't know me. I'll do it. My death will haunt you forever. Mr. Lestrade? Mr. Lestrade. So clever. You see that you care about me. -What was it? -A fisherman. -No way! -He was very old. Nah, it was a chair. Hey, you punk! Do you need a hand? -Can I drop you off now? -OK. The metro station. Go try that shit elsewhere. I wanted to tell you you're good at your job, and I think that's great. I do think that. Don't thank me. It needed to be said. We all need people like you. You'll put my life in order. Believe me, I'll be better for it. But... tell me something. Do you enjoy ruining people's lives? Let me out of this car, please. Why do you do that job? Do you enjoy persecuting men, -looking into their private lives-- -That's enough! Your private life is in all the tabloids. And I do this job to make a living. There are better ways to do so. Maybe, but it's the only one I got to get me through college. The administration paid for my degree. You think I've eaten caviar all my life? I don't think anything. So you think you're the only one to grow up poor. You're the martyrs, and we're just rich guys. You wanna see where I come from? Get me out of this car, now! No way. And don't try to get out at a red light. It's easy to insult people. Come on. The five of us lived in a two-bedroom unit with no heating. The bathroom was outside. Ah, you'll see. It wasn't easy to study for vet school in those conditions. Go ahead. It's over there, on your left. My mom used to wash us in the sink. She'd leave the stove door open so we wouldn't get cold. I'm sure I'll be moved when I see that unit again. Yes, come in. It's about time. I was about to leave. Please, come in. As was stipulated in the ad, it's 120 square meters, it faces south, so the sun floods in, there's a radiator with integrated thermostat-- You've ruined everything. There were... like this. I'm guessing the lady wants to see the kitchen? Microwave, garbage disposal, water softener. -I bet you don't have those at home? -Not that, no. -There's a misunderstanding. -You'll have to hurry up. I have a waiting list. Why should I hurry? I'm in no hurry. An entire family wiped under the rug. Calm down. What's gotten into you? I look really dumb now. -Can I give you a ride? -No. -Come on. I could give you a ride. -No. Oh, shit. Stupid neighborhood. -There. -Can I get a scale? Thanks. I need to weigh the slice. Thanks. Fifty grams. You buy 100 kilos of foie gras per year. That's 2,000 slices. And yet your book says 1,500. -Some of your meals are off the book. -That's not true. Or you're being billed for more foie gras than you get. Why are you looking at me like this? Are you gonna believe her or me? Mr. Duteil will be here soon. What's going on? Can you explain? I'm asking you to open the vault that's in your name. Since it's also in your name, I also brought in your ex. Come on! Is that why I had to leave my clinic? For a vault I haven't used in two years? Oh, well... No. It's this one, right? What did you put inside? Stuff? Jewelry? Cash? A lot of cash? You know how much. What do you mean? It's up to fifty now. Fifty? Fifty million old francs. No way. -Who gave it to you? -JJ, you didn't want the money on your account. What do you-- You're kidding, right? Florence, do you realize how much this could cost me? Fifty million francs! Miss? Fifty million plus an extra fifty million penalty. Do you realize I could lose my clinic? I'm Duteil, the government auditor. Sorry I'm late. Béatrice Flamand, IRS auditor. Pleased to meet you. Thanks. A Cartier watch, with a leather strap and gold clasp. Thanks. A stack of... eight letters, bound with a blue ribbon. A gold wedding ring. Why? Is anything missing? What were you trying to prove? I could've had a heart attack. -You didn't find this funny? -Not at all. I thought that was your kind of humor. The laid-back Dr. Lestrade. I'm sorry I scared you. You're getting old, JJ. How much tax adjustment did you hit him with? 1,350,000 francs. His clothes, his outings, his car-related expenses... Over four years, that's huge. Well, he might be able to justify some of it. He was extremely lucky. If the cash had been in the vault... -he would've been screwed. -Letellier, that's a foul. -"Screwed." -"Screwed", yeah. -Didn't they tell you? -No. Each time we use words like "screwed" or "nailed", we put one franc in the box. House rules. It's the right thing to do. What if we had found cash that wasn't his in the vault? I had a case like that. The guy got taken down. Not my proudest moment. -There's nothing you could do? -Nothing. The law is what it is. There's no need for us to prove their guilt. They need to prove their innocence. To the IRS. I would've expected a higher fine with all the stuff you were telling me. I thought I'd be ruined, down to my last pair of boxers. What did I tell you? If your accounting is spotless, there are no risks. I was expecting more than 1.3 million francs. It's just the first offer. Check out the small print. "In compliance with... blah, blah, blah... IRS rules, "you have 30 days "to register your observations." That nosy bitch didn't find anything. But we'll fight, and she'll never get the 13,000 francs. Why are you saying 13 million when it's just 1.3 million? It's not the same. Pay attention. The currency used is the new franc. It's a good thing I'm here for you. Shit. It's... It's not the same as 1.3 million. You're never happy. Had you been told 13 million from the get-go, you would've paid up gladly. Actually, these are indeed new francs. So it's actually 130 million old francs. That's cute. 'Cause if you add two zeros... Hey! We're drinking champagne! Party time! Yes, Manuel. Yes, indeed. If you add two zeros... It's just a first draft. We have a month to justify ourselves. But... -If you-- -Don't say that. Do you even realize what's going on? You'll see. Ladies, can you please come here? Miss, all the stuff you give to Mr. Bouvier... You write everything down, right? The shots, the X-rays? Of course, sir. And you do that every evening. No, but at least one a week. Do you remember everything? I think so. Yes. That Doberman we vaccinated on Friday... How much did you jot down? Are you sure we did that on Friday, sir? Yes, I'm sure. Do you remember the Doberman, Thérèse? What's a Doberman like? There you go. So we need an ironclad memory now? We'll pull ourselves together and dig ourselves out of the hole. A million here, -another million there... -How do we do that? "I, the undersigned Fleur de Montessui..." "I, the undersigned Fleur de Montessui..." "hereby admit that I invited..." -"hereby..." -Don't forget the "e" at the end. -Are you sure? -I am. All right. "that I invited..." "Sire Lestrade..." What's this nonsense? All right... Write "Mr. Lestrade". "Mr. Lestrade..." "at the restaurant Chez Castel..." "at the restaurant Chez Castel..." "on April 25th, 1982." -"April 25th, 1982." -Then you sign it. -That's it. -Here. Let me see. "I, the undersigned..." "Castel, '82..." Very good. Why did you sign "Paulette Bignac"? Because it's my real name. Oh yeah? Thanks, Paulette. -Mr. Rigueau? -Yes, boss. Can you remind me how much I earn each month? On the official payroll? Of course. But... Oh, I have it. 12,227 francs after tax. Thank you, Mr. Rigueau. As the CEO, you only earn 12,000 a month? Mr. Rigueau, what is my position in the company? Sales representative, sir. It's your company. Your company makes money. How well did our company do last year, Mr. Rigueau? -Very well, sir. -So? We lost 520,000 francs. Thank you, Mr. Rigueau. You'll understand that a sales rep living on 12,000 francs a month, from a company that's losing money, cannot be losing ten million francs at the poker table with you, even as a favor to you. The IRS will never believe that. I get it. Sébastien! Sébastien, come back! No, Sébastien. Come here. Sébastien, no! Sébastien! Unbelievable! Béatrice! Is it bad? Hello, Doctor? An emergency. A dog got run over. Can't they take care of it? All right. I'm on my way. All right. -Mr. Picard? -Yes, that's me. Come in, Doctor. I'm glad you came. I was walking my dog this morning, and all of a sudden, he leapt towards the garbage truck. We love that dog, my wife and me. Do you think we should take him to the clinic? Let me check. That's a good boy, huh? No need to worry too much. It doesn't look too bad. It's not about that. -My husband wants a divorce. -Come on, darling. It's none of the doctor's business. Let's see. Come back! -Lucien, come here! -Sébastien! Psh, good job! Sébastien, come here! Where is that stupid dog going? I'm so sorry. Sébastien, come back here! Well, I'll let you do your thing. What about your dog? It's mine. So... -he's one of that lady's puppies. -Yes. I knew that mix was familiar to me. -At least he's unharmed. -Yes. -Let's hope so. -Come in. Oh. Here you go, doggy. -He seems fine. -He could still be injured. You've heard of internal hemorrhaging, right? The dog seems happy. It's frolicking around, and all of a sudden, vomiting, vertigo, and poof! He's fine. He doesn't have any ailment whatsoever. I'm telling you he's hurt. -Listen to me! -This animal is seriously injured. -Is she here? -Yes. It's her turn to simmer a bit. -You wouldn't want me to... -To perform surgery? Indeed. No need to open her up. Just tell her it's bad and you need to do it. I'll brief her about the situation. Are you sure? This dog is a godsend. Do you realize what this implies? I'll get barred from my profession. And who got you all your dough? I know what you're feeling, but we're at war, big boy. We're not the ones who started it. Come here, Flamand. It's what I thought. Its... its spleen is injured. Do you see this shadow here? Is it a serious injury? No, I mean yes. I have to operate on him right now. What about Mrs. Deussay's dog? She really needs a shot. Are you implying this mutt doesn't? All dogs are equal around here. You know that, right? Excuse me. Are you sure you want to wait here? Yes, I'd rather do that. Come here. Whatever you say. I'll come and get you when I'm done. Hey. Hello. Hello. -Is there an appointment today? -No. -No, thanks. -Scalpel. Scalpel. Put on the drip. Wipe it up. Wipe it up. There's blood everywhere. How can a man like him be made to pay VAT? Do you understand now why he has no time for accounting? -He has more important things to do. -Pliers. Pliers. How does one value the time he spends saving your dog? Some say he gets 50 clients a day, but that's not true. Sometimes, he'll spend the entire day trying to save one mutt. I mean "dog". So it can go back to his loving masters. -Compress! -Coming. It's like asking to see Dr. Schweitzer's books. Ligate these arteries. What are you doing? -I'm leaving. -But-- What you're doing is... -Stay here. -No. Thérèse! Come back. The Algerian fighters were shooting from all directions. And JJ, unfazed, was treating my broken bone. You see, miss, he's a man who-- -So? -He's OK. -It all went very well. -I knew it. Can I see him? Not right now. He's got all these tubes and stuff. I mean. It's not the most pleasant sight. There. Get some rest. We just need to wait now. He'll be back on his paws in a few days. Thanks, Doctor. 44 Moscow Street. We won. We won! We won! Jérôme, calm down. She understood that accounting is secondary. JJ, it's the first time she called you "doctor". Can I sing? Yes? Dr. Lestrade's clinic. Shit. Sébastien! Sébastien! -Sébastien! -Sébastien! Sébastien! Sir, have you seen a dog, medium-sized, with brown eyes? I'm working, sir. -You think it found its way home? -I hope not. She'd be really impressed with you. One hour after his surgery, the dog goes home with no scar. Stop being silly. We'll look around. We'll go door to door. -All right. -Let's do it. Is it true? At least you know. No, it's still too early to... Yes, he still has a chance to make it. I know why you're saying this. Do you want some coffee? Excuse me. He was... He really meant a lot to you. You can get another one. A big one, a small one, a wire-haired dog... No, thanks. I'll do my best to bring him back to you. I'll try everything. Come on. Come on, girl. Yes, I know you're in heat. That's how we'll find him. Don't move. Goodnight, ladies and gentlemen. I'll see you tomorrow at nine... Sébastien? Sébastien? Shoo. Sébastien? Sébastien! Get the hell out of here! Sébastien? Oh, no! This is our neighborhood! You shouldn't have taken her outside. Cut it out, will you? Coming. I know it's early, but I'm really worried. No, it's all right. Come in. No problem. Excuse me. I wanted to show you something. But it's hard to explain. No need to explain. I get it. I doubt that. None of this is your fault. You did what you could. It is my fault, though. You were amazing. Don't say that. I need to explain. Oh, shit. Shit! Tell me how much I owe you. -What for? -The surgery. Come on. It's out of the question. -I insist. -No. -I can't accept. -Why not? Because I'm an IRS auditor? It has nothing to do with that. What is it then? You treated my dog. Same as any other dog. Yes, I mean no. It wasn't the same. I've been working with you long enough to know how much you charge. An X-ray is 150 francs, anesthesia is 250 francs, -and you worked overnight-- -Not the whole night. I owe you about 3,000 francs, VAT included. I don't care. I don't do VAT. I hope I can pay in several installments. -Of course you can. -Thanks. But on one condition: I invite you to dinner. -All right. -You want to have dinner with me? Now I do, yes. Madam, sir, are you sure about this decision? Yes, absolutely. Darling? Can you repeat the reasons for this divorce? I can. I fell in love with my secretary. I'm ready to take all the blame and to pay the alimony you determine. There. What about you, madam? Well. I don't love him anymore. That's life. I realized he's very selfish and is obsessed with money. Every night, he just sits on the couch and watches TV. Come on now. He never showed me he cared about me. He never takes me to dinner. I'm just the housewife who cooks for him and the kids. I've had enough. And also... How should I put it? In bed... Yes? When he touches me, I don't feel a thing. I need to close my eyes and think of movie stars. Who? I need their names. You're so pretty. Wow. I... I got us a table. The owner is gay. The food is great. What is it? Nothing. It's my contact lenses. I'll get used to them. So? Well, in the middle of the river, the scorpion, who's on the hippo's back, stings him anyway. The shocked hippo goes: "Why did you do this to me?" The scorpion replies: "Man, this is Africa." Pretty funny, huh? Kind of long, though. -It's funny. -It's a good one. I'd love to go to Africa. It's a dream of mine. -Oh yeah? -To Kenya... Kenya is amazing. Is this where we're going? -Can we go somewhere else? -Why? -It's gonna be a problem. -What's the matter? -I can't. -What is it? I'm auditing them. -Them? -Yes. -That's funny. -It's awkward. Not at all. On the contrary. It's an awkward situation. No. The boss is really funny. Great sense of humor. -Two champagne kirs. -All right, sir. I hope you have the menu without the prices. I know the prices here. Oh. The lady will surely have the foie gras. Do you know who this is? I won't be serving her. Hey, she's also auditing me. I hope you're proud of yourself. -Jean-Luc left. -Who's Jean-Luc? -My cook. -You'll find a new one. A cook is easy to find, but... Béatrice! Sylvie, come on! Stop it. Open up. This is my home from now on. I just want to kiss the kids goodnight. Wednesday is the day you get to visit them. Thanks a lot for the tip. -Sylvie! -What? What if I asked for your hand again? You're late. Yes, I had work to do. She requested to be taken off your case. She did? Is that bad? Very bad. With the staff shortage, they hate it when their auditors are demoralized. But I didn't... -Will I get a new one? -Of course. But the new one... No need to insist. I've made my decision. It's final. I'm so stupid! I pay my taxes. I have the right to be audited. What is this supposed to mean? What did I do to-- You treated my dog. And you're blue-collar, like me. Is that enough? I took care of your dog like thousands of other dogs. It's no big deal at all. No big deal. And I'm not that blue-collar. My dad was always comfortable. We had everything we needed. You can't just audit billionaires. These days, they're going extinct. I don't want to harm a man like you. Come on, you need to do your job. Or at least your duty. So we'll never meet again? No. What's wrong with me? I don't know. I haven't been with a lot of men. Goodbye. Bye. So? -She won't do it anymore. -It's a disaster. Why? -I think she's in love. -With you? Has she considered our well-being? Does she realize the situation she puts us in? This job isn't for starry-eyed girls. -Where are you going? -Home. -Can you give me a ride? -All right. Can you buy me a drink? I need some advice. About what? Follow me. There she is. What do you think? Call her. I can't do it. Yeah? -Two beers, please. -Draft beer? Yes. Hello, ladies and gents. -So? -She looks nice. She is. -Isn't she a bit young for me? -No. Those legs on her! I'm a leg man. Sir? Mister violin player? Over here. Excuse me. Could you play us some gypsy music? Do you have any change? Sébastien? That's Sébastien. Come here. Now that's a plot twist. This isn't your dog. -Why? Is it yours? -Yeah. You can have him back. He'd only take me to the dumpster. Here you go. What about the two beers? You assholes! -Look-- -I said no. No way. It's the only way to bring her back on our case. -You say it's because she's in love. -Stop. Don't you see I hate it that she's in love with me? To tell you the truth, I... I'm not feeling that great. Exactly. Bring the dog back, and it'll set things straight. No. I can't do that. She's going to hate me. JJ, I don't understand you anymore. You don't want her to love you. You don't want her to hate you. So... What the hell do you want? You're hiding something from me. You're not falling for her, are you? -Stop it. -What would you rather do? Bring the dog back? Or... No need to insist. I can't do that. You're being selfish. We made that girl fall in love, and her career starts with a failed audit. What about her parents who sacrificed so much for her? She'll remain alone. Yeah. She doesn't have anybody in her life. We have the power to reunite her with her dog. -Cut it out, Jérôme. -Look at him. -That's a skinny dog. -He isn't skinny. Wow. Stop pretending that you love animals. It's such a sad and beautiful love story. Have you been invited to the wedding? It doesn't matter. We'll see the pictures in Vogue. What kind of gift will she want? He just gave her 130 million francs. Does she have another girlfriend for me at the IRS? And another one for me? When are you guys going to shut up? Don't insist. They just got engaged. What are you doing? -I should've done this a while ago. -You're not upset, are you? No, not at all. Are you nuts? Something's really wrong with him. There. Your move. You want her to stop being in love with you, huh? -Yeah. -Be brave. Go. Go, Sébastien. You're right to do this, JJ. You may lose her love, but you've gained my respect. Béatrice? I can't believe it. Oh. Nice doggie. Good dog. Thanks. Good dog! Where did you find it? I'll tell you everything, Béatrice. He's just like my dog. A bit skinnier, though. He must be younger. That's a good boy. You're amazing. What should we call him? Sébastien? Oh, no. Not like the other dog. Hello, miss. I'm looking for Dr. Lestrade. Yes? Hello, sir. Marc Letellier, IRS auditor. Dr. Lestrade is out. He has an emergency in Kenya. It's OK. We'll start without him. I didn't know what the lady liked, so I bought some biscuits and herbal tea... Did I do something wrong? Subtitling: Hiventy
