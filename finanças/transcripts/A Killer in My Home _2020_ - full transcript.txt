Hey. What? What? What? What are you doing? What's going on? I swear you better not be wasting my time. Hey! This place is perfect! Okay, Oscar is checking out the room right now. It should fit 300 no problem. Beautiful lighting, you can't see. No peeking. No peeking. All right, here we go. Ta-da! So? What do you think? That... is fantastic. And this is their big event of the season, so we really need that wow factor. Next, we are entering the kitchen, Oscar's domain. All right, right in here. Please show me the kitchen. Okay. So there's plates and stuff. How is it? How do you feel, huh? Liking it? What do you think? The kitchen is... acceptable. Oscar loves the kitchen. Okay. We are gonna go, we're gonna book the venue. Uh, how's the party? I have no idea. I have been working my butt off since seven am this morning. Allison, how long has it been since you've had a fun weekend? I will take care of everything here, okay? Go. Celebrate. Thanks, Melissa. You're the best. â™ª That was great! Thank you. That was great! Thank you very much! Thank you. To be clear, I never asked Hollie to follow in my footsteps. Applying to my alma mater was all her idea. And her decision to study pre-law and fight for justice is a surprise. Frankly, it's easier to imagine daddy's little girl as a movie star, or an Olympic athlete, so, uh, law school should be a breeze, right? Congratulations on being accepted to Porterville University. Congratulations! Cheers! Thank you, Dad. I love you. I love you so much. You're smarter than me, you know. No I'm not! Oh yes you are. - Oh yeah, mm-hm. You're gonna have an amazing future. Thank you. Okay, let's eat! Let's drink! Let's make it a night to remember, right? More champagne! That was wonderful. Really wonderful. I have good news. Melissa decided to take over this weekend, so you and I have so much time to spend-- Ryan? Ryan? Oh my God, are you okay? It's this pressure on my chest. Dad?! Ryan? Ryan! - Dad?! Dad! Call 911! Dad! It's okay. Is he breathing? Honey, the doctor is here. Hello. I'm afraid we're out of options. His heart is too weak for more surgery. We'll have to wait and see, but... his condition isn't likely to improve. Are we talking, um, weeks, or... days? I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay... it's okay. It's okay. Dad, we're not gonna let you go. Okay? Honey, we love you so much. We're gonna fight this. Excuse me, this is a private room. Dad? Allison... Hollie... I'm so sorry. This is my son, Joshua. No... what are you talking about? I'm so sorry. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell you. Please... Please... promise me... you'll take care of him. It's okay. Please promise me. I have your speech if you want to practice. Oh, yes. I do. Thank you. Hollie, want to hear the speech I wrote? Yeah, of course. Great, okay. Thank you so much. As most of you know, I originally was just planning this event. Six months ago my only worries were parking and booking caterers. But since Ryan passed away, this cause has become personal. I never could have imagined that Ryan had a heart condition. He was so full of life. He... water skied, he always won at tennis. He was just filled with so much life. He was my whole heart. He made love a grand adventure, and he made my daughter and I feel cherished and loved every single day. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go! Until dinner is served, we don't rest for a single second. No chatting. No laughing. No phones. Fill these plates and get them out there. Yes, chef! Ryan also taught me a really important lesson. That, um, the heart is the only thing that matters. So please listen to your hearts, and give as much time and love and money as you can afford, because a healthy heart isn't just a medical condition. It's what gives our lives meaning. Thank you. That was amazing. Hey, I just gotta use the bathroom. Be right back. What are you doing here? Get back to work! Hey. Hey! Back to work! This is not your phone. This is the boss's cell phone. Dad would be so proud. Thanks. I just, I'm nervous. I hope I can keep it together. No, no, you're gonna do amazing. Okay. Thank you, sweetie. That was a great speech. If I had money, I'd donate. Thanks, Hayden. I just hope the donors feel the same way. Okay. Good to see you, see you soon. Mr. Atwell! Please, call me Drew. And thank you so much for all you've done for the foundation. This is an amazing kick off to the fundraising season. I know this is personal. Everyone in the community really admired your husband. Ryan changed my life. I guess he's still changing my life. I remember him from the equestrian club, He had this gorgeous chestnut-- Lucky Day! Lucky Day. Beautiful horse. Yeah. Beautiful horse. We still have him. I just don't have much time to ride him anymore. Well, looks like everyone is arriving. But we should talk again soon. Of course. Yeah. Yeah, see you then. Allison, you need to come quick. There's been an accident. What?! Come on. Excuse me. Oscar! So there we no security cameras in the stairwell, therefore there's no security footage of Oscar. The police just think it was an accident, he just... fell. As if we need another reminder about how fragile life is, right? No, Hollie... life is fragile, and short, and time is luck, but life is also strong, and spirited, and I don't want you to be afraid to thrive. So we shouldn't be afraid to face anything, right? Right? No, a little fearlessness is important. Fearlessness? Yeah. So are we ever gonna, you know, talk about what happened? Talk about what? Dad's secret love child. His mistress, the fact that I have a half-brother I didn't know about. The fact that he was a liar and a cheater, and that our entire home life was fake? No... no. Hollie, that doesn't change anything. Your father loved you, he did. Listen, he had his secrets, but that does not change the fact that he loved us, okay? We made a good life. So you're just fine with it? No! No. No... I have my good days, and I have my bad days, and there are times when I want to tear my hair out and scream at your father. But what good is that gonna do? Things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, but I am not gonna let that ruin our happy memories, okay? Right now, I just want to focus on the future. I want to focus on you, okay? I just miss him still, that's all. Of course. Of course you do. I miss him, too. But you know what? I see so much of him in you, you know? I do. Every time you tug on your ear when you're anxious, or when you're frustrated, I see him. How can I stay mad at someone... when I see him in you every day? I love you, Mom. Love you too, sweetie. Wait, who's that? I don't know. I'm not expecting anyone, are you? No. Oh my God. What are you doing here? We've given you both jobs catering at the heart donation event? Please, just hear me out. I told you at the funeral, I never want-- Please, you have every reason to hate me. I'm here 'cause of him. I'm here 'cause of my boy. Thank you. I don't know how you justify sleeping with a married man. I don't. I knew it was wrong. It felt awful. But back then, everything just felt awful. At least Ryan was kind to me. Back then my life was just, it was difficult. I just was desperate for any kind of approval or kindness. The affair only lasted a few months. Ryan broke up with me, and... then I found out I was pregnant. Ryan was decent about it. Joshua grew up thinking he was some kind of rich uncle. It was... it was tough, but not as tough as a lot of the single moms I know. Ryan always made sure things didn't get too shaky. Is that why you're here? For money? No. No, of course not, it's just that... I'm... I'm worried about Joshua's future. He just needs a lot of... care, and I just know that there's only so much I can give him. So naturally you turned to me. I saw your speech. When I was serving at the Heart Health Association dinner, you were very good. Look, I know that I am plenty far from perfect, but Ryan was a really good man. He left some money for Joshua for when he turns 18. A college fund, enough to make a difference. But frankly, I don't know if Joshua's gonna graduate. This year's been tough. I don't want to challenge Ryan's will-- So you want to make a legal case? You sleep with my husband and now you want to sue me? No, it's just that for the past few months, I've been trying to give Joshua the best that I have, and it's just not... it's just not good enough. I need help. Allison... We need help. I have nothing. And I have had nothing before. But I need to find something stable for him. We have nowhere else to go. Please. I can't. I can't. I have to take care of Hollie. I have to make sure that we're taken care of. I-- You promised. You promised to take care of Joshua. Ryan made you promise for the same reason he was so good to us. Family is all that matters. You don't always get to pick your family. He's a good kid. He deserves a chance. Don't you think family matters? Don't you think promises matter? I'm not gonna give you money. But... We have a guest house. It's just been redone, and... Maybe you guys can stay there until you figure things out. Are you serious? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you... Thank you. Um... You know, this could really be a good thing. On the one hand, they're complete strangers. But on the other hand... they are family. And you remember what your father said. You can either do the easy thing, or the right thing. Right, Hollie? Hollie? Hollie! Hey! Oh my gosh, you scared me. You listen to your music way too loud. Yeah, Dad used to get on my case about that too. Hollie... how do you feel about Jenna and Joshua staying here? Well, it's not really my decision now, is it? No, it's not, but I still care about how you feel. I don't want them here. I don't want them to exist in the first place. But... all I care about is school, all right, so I'm just gonna be a good daughter, and I'm just going to focus on college and homework. So you're just gonna let his mistress and his love child live with you rent free? I love you, Allison, but in what world is that not completely insane? They have nothing, and I have more than enough. Jenna just seems so hopeless. How am I gonna live with myself if I kick Ryan's son out into the cold? Oh, I don't know, because he's not your son! Ryan... it was his dying wish, I made him a promise. And besides, ignoring Jenna and Josh is not gonna change anything. You have a big heart, you do, Allison. But I don't want to see somebody taking advantage of you. Well, it's not exactly taking advantage if I let them stay in my guest house. What am I supposed to do? I can't be bitter about something that happened 15 years ago. It doesn't help me, it doesn't help them. I am so blessed, and Joshua never got a fair shot. I just wish that you would stick with your life and she would just stick with hers. And where does that put Ryan's son? If you want to protect everyone, you need to start by protecting yourself. You're right. I... am? Yeah. You still do background checks on our employees right? We... yes. Well, do one on Jenna. See if there's any skeletons in her closet. Mm... now you are talking. Okay. Give me until the end of the day. I'll let you know what I find. Hi. You guys made it. So it's cottage style. There's a bathroom, a small kitchen. Living area... And your common area. This stuff. Um... right over here is one of the bedrooms. And there's someone coming over to put in your Wi-Fi and your cable, and, uh... And the patio outside. That's about it. Wow. It's so new and clean and tidy. A step up from our last place. Well, just, um... take good care of it. And here's the key to the front door. I'll leave you guys to it. We don't want to be any trouble. I know that you never thought you'd have to spend time with someone like me, or someone like... or a kid like Joshua. I don't know, the truth is I don't really know either of you very well at all. He was too young to go. At least we agree on something. Thank you. You're welcome. What did you find? Jenna Fallon, age 38, born and raised in Reseda. Apparently, she was some kind of piano prodigy when she was a kid, flunked out of college. No current job. No current address. She has some arrests though. Drugs, vandalism, disturbing the peace. But all from years ago. Youthful indiscretions. Right now it's like she doesn't exist at all, except for some website where she's selling piano lessons. Piano lessons. That's it. What? That must be how they met. Ryan took piano lessons. It was a hard time in our marriage. Hollie was a toddler, we were fighting a lot. Okay, no. No, don't do that. Don't blame yourself. Ryan is the one who broke his vows. Jenna knew that he was married. I'm not blaming anyone, but understanding the truth it just helps me be more compassionate. So, you're going to let this woman into your life? Ryan already did that. I can't deny that Jenna and Josh exist. So, I might as well just make the best of it. So lucky that we live in a place like this, huh, baby? I guess. I think Allison is nice. What'd you say? Take another one. Go ahead, clean this up. Mrs. Wright? Allison Wright? Yes? Hi. I'm Detective Van Allen. I'm just following up on the untimely death of your associate, Oscar Barbosa. Oscar. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. You frightened me. I'm sorry about that. I wanted to catch you before the end of the day. It's okay. We're reviewing the case, and you knew him pretty well. Yeah, I did. He was a great chef. We worked together for probably ten years. Ten years. Did he have any enemies? Enemies? Yeah. No. He was sharp-tongued, but I don't think anyone held a grudge. Hm. Drugs? Gambling? Problems with women? Anything like that? No. I'm sorry, I thought that they ruled that his death was accidental? Well, it was inconclusive. The coroner had some concerns about cause of death. Concerns? What do they think happened? We don't know. If it's like you say, no enemies, no illicit activities, then it was probably just an accident. Whoa. Probably? You have a nice night, ma'am. Thanks for your help. So, I found out some more stuff about Jenna. Hollie! Whoa! Hi. Hi. Sorry, I thought we were done with dinner. That doesn't invite you to put your earbuds in and ignore me. Okay. What? I found out some more stuff about Jenna. She's, um-- Apparently, she was a piano teacher, and that's how-- Okay, no offense, mom, I just don't really care. Just tell me when they're gone, and Hayden's here to pick me up. He's waiting outside, so... Okay, can you just text me-- Okay, mom! Okay. Hi! Hello. Took you long enough. Oh, yeah, sorry. My mom was being annoying. You ready for a good night? Mm-hm. Come on. There you go. Thank you. Alright. Hey, I didn't know you ran. Just trying it on for size. I saw you running the other day, and it looked good.. Thought about time I turned over a new leaf. Mind if I run with you some day? Not at all. Would you like some? I could use the company. Thanks! How's Hollie handling everything? Uh, like a teenager, I guess, you know? She's still trying to put together the pieces of the shattered heroic image of Ryan. I guess I am, too, if I'm being honest. How's Joshua? He seems like an intense kid. Some people say he's on the spectrum, one therapist said he has some kind of, like, chemical imbalance. He's a sensitive boy. How's he dealing with the loss? I don't think it really sunk in. But, I don't know, then again, for us, Ryan wasn't ever really around. I'm sorry. No, I should be apologizing to you, like, pretty much non-stop. Hey, I know-- I know I'm not supposed to ask for anything else, I just, um, there's someone that wants to meet me and maybe wants to have me as a piano teacher. Congratulations. That's great. Do you think you could watch Joshua just for, like, a couple hours? Just for the afternoon? You want me to babysit for you? No, not babysit, no. Like, just watch him. Like, keep an eye on him for a few hours. I don't know. I'm gonna have to-- Get down on my knees? No, it's not about that. I just-- I just really need the job. I know. I have to check my schedule, though. So, um, I'll get back to you, okay? Okay. See you. Make sure he just gets out once a day. I just, you know... Of course. So, the doctors say no sugar, but, you know what? I think candy is okay. Make sure he does his homework. He hates doing it. Okay. Thanks again! So, what do you want to do? Do you like baseball? I think Ryan had a glove and a ball around here. No. What about video games? You like video games? No. Give me one second. Wow. They fit. They were, uh, your dad's, obviously. Come with me. You know, I was an anxious kid. I didn't really get any of the other kids at school. My parents were so outgoing and fearless. They always thought there was something wrong with me. So, I get it. I mean, I'm sorry. I kind of get it as much as I can get it, right? Okay. This one's for you. Hello. Hi. Now, you just take the brush, and do nice, long, gentle strokes. Look at that! You're a natural. It feels nice to connect, right? I know I think sometimes the best way to feel a lot of love it's good to give a lot of love, you know? Hey. What do you want? Um, I-- Just speak up if you have something worth saying. Okay, I was just wondering-- What? --If I could see you-- Whoa, you trying to get some time in with my girl? No, I-- Ew, that's gross. He's, like, my half-brother. Yeah, but he's a creepy little freak, I'm sure he wouldn't mind much. Ain't that right? No, I-- Well, I just wanted to know if I could see your-- See her what? See her what, huh? Creep. The lady said "go away." Hayden-- She doesn't want a serial killer half-brother. Wow. Are you kidding me? No, no, no! Huh? Throw a punch at me and I'll put you in the hospital, you worthless little turd! Stand up. Stand up and apologize to my girl. I'm trying to teach you some manners, huh? Apologize. Sorry. It's okay. Don't worry about it. Yeah, don't worry about it. Worry about me. Now, get out of here. I gotta go. Wait, Hollie-- I'll see you later. I gotta go. Hey, does Josh need a ride? No, he's fine. Did I see that right? 'Cause it kind of looked like Hayden's friends were giving him a hard time. I guess Joshua is pretty easy to pick on though, right? He's had a hard life, Hollie. Okay, so, is this where you tell me that I should be so grateful for my amazing life and we need to spend so much time and energy making sure Joshua's happy? He just doesn't need to worry about it. Well, neither do I. Just try and be understanding. Yeah, whatever. I was just wondering if you, uh, still wanted to look at cars today. You know, I've been seeing sale signs up all over the place. Can we? Really? Wow, that changed your attitude. Just a little bit. Mom, this one looks amazing. Hollie, no. We're not doing that. Come on. Tell me what you were gonna show me in the back. Oh, my God. This is insane. Holy cow. It's a sweet Jeep, isn't it? Yeah. I like the idea of something that can go off road. You know, like, the mountains, or the beach, or something. It's kind of cool, something when you can be so free. Yeah, a girl like you would look good in a ride like this. Thanks. You must have saved up all year for this, huh? Yeah. I worked for, like, two years straight to save up for my first ride. Wow, what kind of car was it? Well, it wasn't a car, it was a Harley. Wow. I'm sure your mom wouldn't approve of all that power and danger, though, right? No, probably not, but she doesn't make all my decisions for me. Really? What kind of decisions do you wanna make today? Um, uh-- I'll let you get that. Um, mom? Yeah, I'm just on the-- on the side of the dealership. Like, if you come around-- Hi, yeah. There you are. Isn't this insane? Check this out. This is amazing. Hollie, these are really bad on gas mileage. And it's really expensive. Yeah, but I thought this would be, you know, we could use some of the money that Dad left us on this. It would be kind of, like, an investment. That's not really how it works, sweetie. Your dad wanted you to be self-reliant. Yeah, but with college coming around I just thought that, you know, maybe-- You would make a withdrawal from the Bank of Mom and Dad? Well, I think it's just the bank of Mom now. Even if it is Dad's money. Wow. Listen, Hollie, I don't want to fight. Okay, sweetie? Hey, freak. What are you doing in my bag? You know that breaking and entering is still a crime, right? Do you want to go to prison? Yeah, stay away. Not bad. It's nice and big. Good central location. Girl, if you want to butter up some rich folks, this is the place to do it. It just seems a little generic. And you were expecting what? The White House? Wrigley Field? What about the ranch? Your home? You know, set up some pictures of Ryan, show what he accomplished, what he could have accomplished. It would make it really personal. Personal is good. For goodness' sakes, it's about time you have a party. Yeah. Still pissed about the car, huh? Yeah, I just think dad would have seen things differently, you know? Yeah. Hey, listen, I've been thinking. You know, even though I got rejected to Porterville, my chances of getting in go way up if I do a year at state first. Just got to keep my grades up. That sounds like a good idea. Except I don't think I've ever seen you studying before. Well, maybe we should do a year of State first, you know? Hit the books really hard, and then we can transfer to Porterville together. Well, I already got into Porterville, Hayden. That's where I'm going. Why would I go anywhere else first? So we can be together? Well, I can see you on weekends. Porterville's not that far away. I just think when you're in a relationship and you love someone, you should be willing to make a compromise. Okay, well, seeing each other on the weekend is the compromise. Right? Do you think you're better than me just because your SAT scores are good and you got into a better college? No. Hayden, no. That's not what this is. It's just, I've always had my heart set on Porterville, but since dad's gone, it's just-- it's like the closest thing I'm gonna have to seeing him again. And I know it sounds really crazy. It's just-- I need to feel close to him somehow. Yeah, yeah. Weekends and holidays. Okay, weekends and holidays. Look! Hey. Thanks. So, between his life insurance and his investment portfolio, Ryan left me more money than I thought. How much more? A million. Not bad. So, I thought that I would set up Hollie's college fund and then making the rest of it a donation. You know, that Heart Health Association is doing a lot of great things and I think that Ryan's money could really help out the endowment fund. Yeah, it would make a huge difference. But? But a one and done donation? That only scratches the surface. When I worked in the not for profit world, we had all kinds of ways of stretching a dollar. Like what? Like corporate sponsorship. Philanthropic partners. Fiscal multipliers. It's matching funds. Okay, you can turn a million dollars into two million, three million, five million, who knows? How? Well, you don't do it by waltzing into the Heart Health Association and just writing them a big fat check. What you do, is you get a bunch of rich people together, okay? And you inspire them, you challenge them, and you get their egos all excited about the promise of doing good. Okay, that sounds great. How do I do that? You're an event planner, silly. Just turn it into an event! Yeah, and you're a genius. I know. Well, I hired you, so that makes me a genius. Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Hollie! Hollie? Hollie! Hollie! Hollie! Hollie! Hollie! Mom! Are you okay? Call the police. Go. Call the police right now. They tried to break into the safe in the study, but couldn't bust it open. So, this list of stolen valuables, you estimate at around $30,000? Oh. And my wedding ring. He, uh, took my wedding ring. Your wedding ring? Yeah. I don't know how much it was worth. I'm gonna have to call the insurance company, but it was worth a lot. You should arrest them. Hollie-- I caught Joshua breaking into the house this afternoon! Do you think that's a coincidence? Ma'am, we've contacted Jenna and Joshua and they have a solid alibi for tonight. Really? Both of them were teaching piano. To the mayor's daughter, actually. It all checks out. Any idea who else might want to steal from you? No. No, it has to be them. Hollie, it doesn't have-- Dad is dead, and now it's like they're stealing every single memory we have. Like we knew nothing real about him. Everything's just gotten worse since they showed up. No, honey. The trouble started long before that. Now, I know it's probably not gonna impress your cool friends, but it will get you from point A to point B. Ta-da! Oh. I just didn't know it was gonna be so old. Well, your mom said you just needed something to get you in and out of the city for college. Yeah, that was the idea. Okay, listen. I know it's not flashiest thing in the world, but it's served me well. So, Melissa's giving us a good price, so we can split this one and that way you have money left over to get, you know, whatever else you need. Thanks. Thank you. She got the idea from that big donation she's making. Wait, what donation? I am gonna make a donation to the Heart Health Association in your father's name, and that way his money can be used for something good. Wait, that was for us. He wanted us to have that. You're just giving it away? No, I'm still going to pay for college, Wait, no, no, no. What do you mean? How much are you giving away? I haven't decided yet. This was supposed to get my life started. I thought, after everything, that would be the one thing that would make life easier instead of harder. Honey, we talked about this. Your father and I wanted you to be self-reliant. Oh, sorry. I guess I just forgot the discussion where we agreed to give everything that dad worked for away. Um, did you want to take it for a test drive? Maybe later. Hey, do you recognize that truck? What truck? Behind us. There's no truck behind us, mom. What? Could have sworn I saw something. Yeah, I think I saw that truck before. It's not from our neighbourhood for sure. Hey, buddy. Hey. I do. I am. I'm so sorry that I spilt the beans about your donation. It's okay. I'll talk to Hollie. I'll make her understand about the donation. It'll be fine. Well, look, I was thinking. Uh-oh. Well, Jenna checks out, right? But you two kept talking about Joshua, and how strange he is. Well, he's a misfit, but he's a sweet kid. Well, I did some digging and he has a record. How can he? He's 16 years old. Well, it seems like he spent two of those years in juvenile detention. He graduated from biting his teachers to setting fires. He burned down Jenna's apartment complex when he was just 12 years old. He's been kicked out of four different schools. He's got all the earmarks of a budding serial killer. I had no idea. Due diligence. Hold on one sec. Hey, Hollie. What's up? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Okay, okay. Meet me at the coffee shop by school. I'll be right there. We'll figure this out. Don't ask. How could they do this!? They already accepted me. Well, it says they're reviewing your acceptance "due to academic infractions, including credible allegations of plagiarism and questions surrounding the integrity of your exams." What are they talking about? I don't know! I never cheated on anything! I didn't plagiarized anything I didn't steal anybody's work! This is crazy. I don't know why anyone would think this! Okay, it says that there's allegations. So, that means somebody must have said something. It's Joshua! Hollie-- Come on, Mom, you know it has to be Joshua or Jenna! I caught him digging through my backpack, remember? He must've been, I don't know, like, messing with me, or making up lies or something. Okay, okay. Well, it says here there is an appeals process and this is all pending a final decision. Great, great. So, I just have to wait until we can prove somebody's lying about me and put my entire life on hold. That little creep has caused enough trouble. I should just beat the crap out of him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's just all take a deep breath. We can figure this out. Figure what out, mom? It's just another part of Dad's legacy that's been ripped away from me. Maybe I should just forget about college altogether. Honey. Hayden, thank you for your help in this. Of course. If you need anything just let me know. Of course. Jenna. Jenna? Sorry, I, uh-- I couldn't resist. I was just cleaning up, and I saw the piano and I just-- I just wanted to-- Wait. Mom, she rearranged everything. No, I just, um-- I was just cleaning up and I-- Where did these photos come from? You weren't the only part of his... ...family. I was just honoring him. You're wearing his shirt. You're wearing his shirt. Are you insane? You come into my house, put up these photos. Take off his shirt right now! I bought him-- I bought him this shirt. Christmas, ten years ago. Maybe you guys remember. He wasn't here for Christmas Eve, 'cause he was-- he was with us. I'm sorry. It's just that so far we've been erased from the story. Ryan loved us. Get out of our house! Jenna, you've crossed a line. You've taken advantage of my hospitality. I swear, if you even-- That is so cool! You look so cool! Baby, you look so bad-ass and grown up! What the hell? Okay, give me your phone. Let me get a picture! Uh. Take a picture! Jenna, I thought you were staying in my guest house because you didn't have any money. Yeah. Yeah, I was. Things change. Okay, great. Stand up! Don't slouch. W here did you-- Where did you get the money? You really think that's any of your business? You should just be happy for us. Okay, mama's gonna take this for a test drive. Take it for a test drive, baby. Oh, yeah, baby. You're the best mom ever. Hey, Hayden, what's up? It's, like, the coolest car, and he's, like, the lamest kid in school. Whoa, I thought they were supposed to be poor You know, like, barely scraping by? Who knows? They're just creepy liars. Mom still isn't kicking them out. You think that little puke stole it? I don't know. He could've. That's messed up. Mm-hm. And you're right, he really doesn't deserve a car that cool. Hayden, what are you doing? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Alright, you will thank me later. Yeah, I just got it. It's mine. Oh, my God. You gotta get this on your Insta. I'll take a picture for you guys. Come on. You could never own that Jeep. Oh, my God. Give me your phone, you guys. I'll take a photo. What the hell? You're welcome, m'lady. No, no. Are you serious, Hayden? What? You said it yourself. He's the lamest kid in school. It's not like he's gonna figure out who did it. Besides, what if he does? I could beat the crap out of that loser. Hayden, beating somebody isn't sexy, it's pathetic. And so it taking off the antenna of someone's car. How am I the pathetic one? I think you always were. What? I was protecting you, you spoiled brat. Wow. It's over. What's over? No, don't touch me! You and me, Hayden? We're done. It wasn't gonna work, Anyways. Hollie! You're just-- You're always so angry when anybody else does well. You can't be happy for anyone else's success and it's petty and lame. Really? Sounds like you. Well, I guess I have. I've realized I've been guilty of the same thing, but at least I'm smart enough to realize that it doesn't make me any cooler by making fun of unpopular kids. Hollie-- Get lost, Hayden. For real. Hey. Hey. He looks pretty pissed. Uh, yeah, he usually is. You probably shouldn't hang out with me. No, no, no. I can hang out with whoever I want to. Listen, about your Jeep. What? Nothing. I'll explain to you later. I just-- Can you give me a ride home? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get in. Um, so, can I ask you a question? You can ask me anything. How did you get the money? For the Jeep. Mom's always broke, or she's got too much money. I don't think she's very responsible, but at least she's being nice to me, 'cause usually she's pretty stressed. So, you don't know where it came from? I just picked out the car. So, what do you want to do, Joshua? I mean, like, sorry. What's your thing? You mean what do I want to be when I grow up? Yeah. I don't know. I want to tell the truth. I don't want to be a hypocrite. I want to triumph, and see all my enemies destroyed, but, um... probably just something with animals, you know? Like a vet tech, or something. Oh, really? Yeah. You know we have horses at the ranch, right? Yeah, are they nice? Are they easy to ride? They can sense fear. So, if you're stressed around them they get stressed and-- But it's nice. You have to be really calm. Wait, what's going on? Are these friends of your mom's? I'm not sure. Um, hi. What are you doing here? Do you know Jenna? Do you know Jenna? Where's Jenna? Mom? Excuse me. Jenna. Hi. I'm so glad you're here! What's going on here? Sorry, everything kind of got a little outta hand. But it's okay, we're celebrating! What are you celebrating? I just got a few more regular students for piano lessons! Good money. Enough to help me get back on my feet. Jenna, I thought that I was crystal clear. When you and Josh moved into the guest house-- It's okay. I'm moving out. What? When? End of the month. I already started looking for a place. I'm gonna have enough clients, you know, I should be able to do okay, and take care of Joshua. Look, you guys have been incredible. I will never forget your compassion and your patience. And, uh, I'm sorry I'm not the world's best roommate. Jenna, I just need you to wrap up the party now. Everybody has to leave right now. Definitely. Definitely. Can do. I just thought you might-- What? Want to a keg of kegger with your drunk friends? No, I thought that you might like the fact that one of my drunk friends found this. And she's wearing it. Where did they find it? Lying on the driveway. I guess the guy who robbed you, I guess he dropped it when he was-- when he ran away. I never thought I'd see it again. You're welcome. Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you. Thank you so much. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry everything got out of hand. But things are looking better, no small thanks to you. Okay, great. Jenna-- Your fundraiser is on Saturday, right? Can I help? I mean, you gotta admit, I'm pretty good at throwing a party. Seriously, I just, like, I owe you. So, I could do anything. I could decorate, I could park cars, I could clean, I could do whatever you want. Maybe you need a piano player? I appreciate that-- I just wanna be useful, you know? Jenna, I appreciate that, I really do. Great, you can help me by wrapping up the party right now. Okay. Thank you. Alright, guys! Party's over! What? Time to go home. What's going on? She could have kept it for herself, but she gave it back, you know? That says something. Yeah. Yeah, that says something. What do you mean? So, it was just sitting there on the driveway when her drunk friend found it? That's a pretty fishy story. Why would they steal it just to give it back? Um, so you would trust her, just like you're doing right now. I'm not trusting her. I feel bad for her. Allison, can I be honest? Please, you're my best friend. Yes. Uh, she just wants money. That is why she's being friendly with you, because she wants you to give her things. No, no. Not for her. For Joshua. I mean, could you imagine having a kid like that and thinking about his future? It would be terrifying. Are you sure he's not in on it? In on what? They're moving out and she offered to help with the fundraiser, and I think that's very nice. Well, they're not gone yet. Just saying. I'm just saying you need another sprint, let's go. Come on, plug her in. That's not gonna change my mind about this whole situation, just to let you know. Well, maybe a little run will help you. Did you know she has a fiancÃ©? Who? Your new best friend. I know him. He was following me the other day. He's the guy with the truck. I bet you he knows everything. I bet he probably wants Jenna but not if it means he needs to take care of some-- Okay. --Creepy juvenile delinquent. You know, that's probably their plan. Yeah. They want to butter you up, they're going to dump that kid on you and run off and live happily ever after. You're imagining things. Yeah? I know that you think people are automatically trustworthy because you trust them but I have this suspicious little voice in my head and you know it always tells me the truth. What is that suspicious little voice telling you? That his name is Travis Rabinsky and I have his address. No. No, no, no, no way. Just going to go over there, we're going to ask some questions. You know, just snoop around a little. You know you want to. Of course I don't want to. Jenna has moved on and so should we. And besides, I have so much work to do for this fundraiser tonight. Okay, well, it's on my way home so I will let you know what I find. No! No. Promise me you won't go there. Okay? Okay. I promise. Great. Go straight home. Okay. Hello? Hello? I need directions. Anybody home? Hello? Hello? What is this? This doesn't add up. Oh my God. The Cayman Islands are nice year round. I'm gonna-- I'm-- You stand a much better chance if you tell the truth. I'm sorry. I'm going to leave. The truth is I haven't really decided on the Caribbean or the Cayman Islands. I was thinking maybe Thailand, you know. Or maybe Belize, 'cause you know, they speak English in Belize. Mm-hm. We can decide that later, right? I thought it was just going to be a quick scam for a couple thousand bucks but your friend, she's worth a lot more than that, you know that don't you? Sorry. We can't have any loose ends. Let's make this look like an accident with your car. We found her unconscious in her car. Looks like an accident. Is it going to be permanent? I don't know. It's bad though. The doctors say that she, um, has swelling on her brain and they put her in a medically induced coma until, I don't know, she gets better? This is so scary. Hollie, this was just a really tra-- Mom, this is the second one of your friends that's suffering from a mysterious accident. You're right. Oscar. Yeah. It just seems like a really big coincidence after everything else that's been happening. But who would want to hurt Oscar? Who would want to hurt Melissa? I don't know! Maybe it's just the wrong place at the wrong time. Why was she even over at that house in the first place? I told her not to go She was checking up on one of Jenna's friends. Jenna? Again? Mom, didn't you say that Jenna was there the night that Oscar died? Oh my God. You're right. We have to go. Yeah. Hi. Where were you tonight? Uh. I'm not sure why it's any of your business but I had a piano lesson. I just got home about an hour ago. Barbara Landry, if you want to call and check. She's your daughter's English teacher. Where was Joshua? Joshua? Why-- Why don't you tell me why-- My best friend's in the hospital and I think you know why. I'm sorry. I'm not following. It's either you, or Joshua, or that boyfriend that you don't want to talk about, Travis. You might not have done it but you know something that you're not telling me, so why don't we get the police here and they can answer all my questions. Well, I already talked to the police today. 'Cause you're right, there is something that I haven't told you. It's about the robbery. I saw someone around the house the day before, and I don't know, I just-- I thought it was one of Hollie's friends but then I couldn't figure out why he'd-- Okay, who did you see? It was Hayden. I'm sorry to tell you this. It was Hayden, he robbed you. Look what we found stashed under your son's bed. That's not mine. I don't know where that came from. Hollie! Hollie, I didn't do it. Tell them I didn't take that, okay? I don't know where it came from. That's my wallet. Son, I'm going to need you to go ahead and stand up for me. I'm placing you under arrest. I didn't-- I didn't do anything. I didn't steal from you, Hollie, I swear. Someone's framing me. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I admit it, I stole stationary from the Principals office and wrote that letter, okay? I just didn't want you to go but-- Hollie, please. You make me sick. Oh my God. Please, I didn't do anything. I'm innocent! I just wanted Hollie to stay. Please, Mom! Mom, I didn't do anything. Knock-knock. Come on in, I'm just packing up. We'll be out of your hair in a few days. I owe you a big apology. Don't worry about it. I'm relieved it was Hayden. It was like-- I never-- I just had my suspicions about Joshua, I just never know about him. He's always so sweet with me. Yeah, well, it's a lot easier to deal with him if you're not responsible for his actions. Still, I'm sorry. I was really harsh. I think that-- I think I blame you for Ryan cheating. I've come to the conclusion that we both suffered enough. Thanks. He loved you He really loved you. I think he just felt sorry for me. No, I've got to admit that I really admire you. For real? I do. You're gutsy and you're not afraid to ask for help when you need it. No, you're this single mom with this tough kid. Stop. I don't need your apologies or your compliments. It's a weird situation for all of us. I know it is. I've just been so stressed about this event. It's feels weird doing it without Melissa, you know. She's such a big part of it. I'm sure she would want you to go ahead with it. You put all your time and energy into the cause. Look, the least I could do is help you out on that night. You know, we just bury that hatchet, and I don't know, work together. It's a deal. Yeah? Yeah. Shake on it. Okay. Hey. Hey. Boy, am I glad to see you awake. You gave us such a scare. Allis-- Allison. Shh, shh, shh. You have to rest, okay? Just relax. The doctors say you're going to be fine. Je-- Jenna. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know. Jenna talk to me. We figured it all out. It's okay. Everything's okay. It's fine. It was all just a big misunderstanding. I'm so happy you're going to be okay. Hi. There you are. Yeah. Can't wait to see what you got planned. Well, um, just waiting for everybody to drink a little bit more and then I'm going to give a speech, so hopefully it goes well. I promise it will be brief. Well, like everyone here, I'm happy to pay tribute to Ryan. I'm even happier to hear from you. The foundation owes you a huge debt of gratitude. My son, Thomas-- Thanks. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm better now. No, I've tried the rosÃ© but I haven't tried the cabernet. Hey. Come over here. What? Come on. What? What are you doing? I swear, you better not be wasting my time. Joshua. Why are you doing this? Joshua, what's going on? You can talk to me, Joshua. It's okay. Please just talk to me! Joshua! If there is any trouble at all, you kill her. You understand? Are you sure about this? Yeah. You do what I say, or else. Hey, Jenna, I'm about to give my speech in a few minutes. Have you seen Hollie? Oh yeah, she said that she was waiting for you at the Quonset hut. She said she wanted to talk to you about something. The Quonset hut? Okay. Thanks. Please! Please, Joshua! You don't have to do this. Help! Help me! Help! Help, somebody! Okay. Help, somebody! Please, Joshua. You don't have to do this. I-- I want to help you. What-- What do you need? I need you to stay right there! Okay! Okay! I will! It's just, somebody else wants you to do this, right? But that doesn't have to happen, I can help you. We can escape together. That's not that plan! Well, what's the plan? Please, Joshua, just tell me what's going on. I want to help you! I can! I'm your friend! Friend? No, no, no. To you I'm just a creep, remember? A freaky little creep! So why should I help you now? Excuse me? What are you doing here? Where's Hollie? You're looking Hollie? Yeah. Hollie's being taken care of as we speak. Jenna, what's going on? Just tell me where Hollie is. She's safe. Help me! Are you recording? Mom, help me. I don't know what's happening. Please help me. Please help me. I don't know what they're doing to me. For now. I was wrong about you. I was wrong about you, Joshua. You're not a creep. I assumed the wrong things. Hayden was the one who was trying to undermined me. But I just don't understand, why did you go into my house and go through my backpack? What were you trying to steal from me? Steal? No. I just wanted your Algebra II homework, okay? You get good grades. I'm-- I'm sorry, Joshua. I didn't give you a fair chance. You're not a creep except for right now. You're in danger of becoming one. I've got a job to do! What's the job? Just please be honest with me. What's going on, Joshua? Please. You just want me to listen to you now because you're afraid but my mom was right about you this entire time. Jenna, what's going on? What do-- What do you want? We're here to get paid and we don't have all night. So why don't you tell this sad soccer mom what prize she has won? You stupid girl, you believed my entire act, didn't ya? But you know what? Your husband didn't, that's why he was paying me 1,000 buck a week, 'cause he knew I could ruin his life. Grab her phone. So, my original plan was just to take whatever I could get and move on but you seemed so guilty about Joshua. Then we found the million dollars in your bank account that you just plan on giving away. I can't imagine being so rich that I could just give away a million dollars. I'll do anything you want, okay? Just let Hollie go. Good. I like the way you're talking. Your mom is manipulating you, Joshua. Please just-- - Shut up! Listen, do you hear them? They're scared. Remember what I told you about the horses? How they feel everything? Imagine how they feel right now. Imagine how you're going to feel if you go to jail cause of this. I'm going back to jail anyways. Instead of signing over a million dollars to some do-gooder charity-- You're going to transfer that million dollars into our bank account in the Cayman Islands. Or you could leave Hollie at the mercy of Joshua's teenage angst. You want me to tell you what I told him to do to her? Jenna, please. Please. Please. I'll do anything, just don't let him hurt Hollie. Okay? I'll do it. Okay. Let's get started. Type in your password. Then I'll take you through the steps. Come on! How long's this going to take? I have no idea. It's not like writing a cheque, is it? Just remember, you try anything, Hollie's reunited with her father. You know Hayden didn't rob you, it was my fault, I framed him. Yes, because your mother made you do it. It's not who you are, Joshua. It's not too late, not if we get up right now and stop her. Um, she just needs you mother to do something for-- uh, at the bank or something for-- for-- My mom? You need to let me go right now, Joshua. We need to go save my mom. I need to save my mom, Joshua! Let me go! Just press enter please! - Okay. - Thank you. Money's in our account? Yeah. A transaction this big, they're going to call to verify. Look, when they call, I'm going to hand you this phone and you're going to make it nice and smooth. You're going to play nice, right? Right? Right? Yes. Are you listening to him? Are you listening to him? Yes. I can't hear you. Yes. Thank you. How long's this going to take? Don't you get any ideas. Did I tell you that you could get up? Look at you just standing there like a little mouse. Everybody just walks all over you. You know, I took your husband, then I took you ring, and now I'm going to take your money. I pulled your entire life out from right underneath you, you still have nothing to say. Look at you just standing there, you little spoiled little girl. Just standing there, just standing there. Huh? Got something to say to me? Jenna! Ah! Mom! Hi. You're okay. Hello? Hello? No, no. Don't transfer the money. They held us hostage. Just call the police. I think you need serious help, Mom. Okay, thanks. If you end up adopting Joshua you'll still have plenty of love in the house so. See, it always pays to give people a chance, right? Always. Life is full of surprises. Yeah, it sure is. You drive safe. You call me the second you get there, okay? I will. Okay, Mom. Love you. I love you. I love you. Bye. Safe travels, Hollie. Text me when you get there. Bye! Bye! I love you.
