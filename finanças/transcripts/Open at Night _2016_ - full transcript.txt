- Mireille, hurry. I'm on. - What's the problem? Move it. Can't you hear? I'm on now. - Let me finish. - That was my cue. - Listen to me! - I'm doing the hem! Let go, let go! Hurry up, Mireille! Let me go on stage! - Good going. - Fat whore! Dumb bitch! Fuck you! 10-minute break! Take ten! Did I say "smoke"? You waved at me. Did I say "smoke"? I'd gun them all the fuck down. Where's Luigi? I have no idea. I may not pull up tomorrow's curtain. - Safety curtains are heavy. - Stop. Listen, forget about it! Luigi will go see Mrs. Pelissier. Everything's fine. We've changed the backdrop 8 times. Maybe we could get some back pay. It would make sense. Where are you going? Luigi isn't back yet? Back? Know where he is? The Jap doesn't know I play the ape tomorrow. An ass-hair ape suit for Japan's ancestral treasure. - Your Luigi is something. - He's not mine. National, not ancestral. Yes, Merriam Webster. You'll get your welfare benefits. Eat my benefits. Actors get welfare for so little work? - Unbelievable. - Who said that? Lots of people cheat. Did Luigi pay the Guild? No! I finished. Can I go? Mr. Blandin for Luigi. Finished with what? Can Popeye come up for Luigi? No, no, no! The more you say no, the harder I get. Usually on the weekend... "Usually" doesn't exist here. Did you ask the boss? The boss? We spoke once. He was drunk. Save the hyperbole for your internship reports. Luigi? Is he back? Did you tell him? Relax, I spoke to Clara. - I hope she dies. - Stop! Yes, Mireille, we'll kill her. Don't worry. Luigi? Full house? Half full? It's not the same. - Where's Luigi? - No idea. - He's not too involved. - Before open night! You're welcome. Prune, all I want is an estimate. No, I'm not upset. No, this is not my unpleasant tone. Luigi! Nawel. - My expenses. - On my desk! Goddammit, Prune! Please, Prune, don't cry. Check the figures again. Call Theater Online, Cheap Tickz, Ticket-Tac, the FNAC. The FNAC. F... N... A... C... It's not at all what you think. Nawel? You want to touch base? Make her sleep. Or continue to sleep. Take it down a notch! - Down! - I disgust myself... Mr. Galabru, take it down a notch. I disgust myself... Take it down! I disgust myself. Prune, no one is questioning your competence. Not at all. I'll call you back. I was looking for you. - Hello, Luigi. - Hi, gorgeous. - Is the cloud machine fixed? - Cloud? Smoke. Galabru is good. Damned good. What an actor! It's all about voice. Actors should be appreciated blindfolded. Is this what matters? Luigi! A guy's here for you. - Describe him. - Bum. - Coming. - What a genius. I have Galabru's agent. Kiss and hang up. You told Dazai Chris is the ape tomorrow? Of course he knows... I'm telling him now. Mrs. Dos Santos says she's... I can't stand you anymore. I mean it as a friend. Mrs. Dos Santos, my ass! He must realize I won't use a real ape on stage! "Must realize" or "knows"? Not exactly the same thing! Don't take that checkbook. We're overdrawn 300,000. Having it on me doesn't mean I'll use it. Why is my bed unmade? I spoke to Pelissier's secretary. Go and she'll give you the check. I know you don't like it, but go and charm her. And remember to go and reassure the crew first. Tell me. Did you think I said that inanity: "It's not at all what you think"? No. But I didn't know about your appointment. I was with Karine, a friend of Chris'. Chris asked me to see her. He said it would be nicer, more humane, to do her a favor, to give her an interview... He thought it would be interesting for her... Luigi, phone call. Yes? - Galabru's agent? - No, Clara's. For you. Shall I put her on? Yes, I have to... The size of the names... Hers is as big as Galabru's. It's right here. I have the poster here. I'm not crazy! Fran√ßoise, we're one big family. Who cares about contracts? Sure, she'll be on stage tomorrow. What do you mean? Let's deal with these minor squabbles after opening night. Is that legal? What? I'll put Nawel on. No, I won't. You're right. It's better. I'll call you back. Thanks. Excuse me? Is there a problem? Insurance-wise, if someone performs without a contract, he's not covered. I was wondering if it's legal. Are those sausages? Yes. Who's she? Our graduate-school intern. Here since Tuesday. What's that outfit? I put her at the bar today. I see, she's the bar intern. How's the bar internship? Epitome of my career! Go wipe some glasses. It's better for all concerned. Dazai is fine with whatever you tell him. - Ever talk to kids? - No. Like talking to my grandparents. They're crazy. An idiot. I have no time. The crew's waiting. Talk to him. Every time you get plastered, you invite every drunkard to stop by. Should I talk to utility-room Karine too? Utility-room Karine? All these crazies now... Unbelievable... What a bunch of retards. I want to slap them good. Utility-room Karine is a job-seeking lady. And my job is to meet job-seekers. Yep. Young, sexy and buxom means she can't work? You find that fair? When you came to Paris, you were glad to work. Go ahead! Little Nawel arrived with a backpack, scarf and crayons. You were inexperienced too! Funny how I remember things differently. Nawel said to ask you. Put it on my desk. I'll pay after we open. Paying after doesn't exist! Now it does. Wasn't I right? What? - It started? - I'm going back in. So let's go around back. - Nice girl, Karine. Sweet. - Very. Go on, I can't hear a thing. Don't hurt her. She's the romantic type. You bet. She can leave the utility room. We don't bite. She's not my girlfriend either. I'm just helping. Helping with what? What can she do? Someone here is a pain. Guess who! You watch out too! Why is this here? How are ticket sales? No precise figures. I said not to hire Prune. - Her husband has hemiplegia. - She sucks. Is that really nice? - She sucks. - She what? Sucks. - She's not great. - Here you are. So near. Pressed against me. You say nothing. I feel your hands. Your sincere hands. Rugged like a winter morn. Slowly sliding along my skin. I feel your warm breath caressing my neck. Am I dreaming? It's beautiful. - Gorgeous set. - It better be. During the break, go backstage and reassure the crew. Mr. Michel Galabru, take it down a notch. Why this strange sensation of being held prisoner? I know not whether I will wake. Dazai didn't want to work in France anymore... Do nothing. - And here he is. - What do I do? Shut up. Please, Mr. Galabru. Take it down. I feel your warm breath caressing my neck. Am I asleep? Mr. Galabru, do nothing! Shut up. That's his text? - Understand French? - What do I do? Do I continue? It's not a comedy. Since I do nothing, I may as well do it at home. Mr. Galabru! Something's wrong. Sit down! There's a problem. They exhaust me. 10-minute break. Go ahead. Go on! Can I come down? Is there a ladder? Michel... are you coming back? At my age it's hard to predict the future. Finally! Help. Take ten! Faeza! A bucket, ice cubes, towels. Hurry! I'll call you back. 2 months without pay and you're upset? What does this mean? Will money problems tear us apart? I'll invite you all out to dinner after opening night! Can anyone of you tell me eye to eye that he started a show here without being paid in full? Besides you. I didn't dream it! You swore we'd be paid before we open! If you pay us tomorrow, it's cool. Get your priorities straight, dammit! I have a man down, a colleague of yours! Chris... Look at me. I think you're better. What makes you think so? Here? Here. Right here... more I press, more it hurts. And if I press more, more pain. More I press, more it hurts? Can we see the scene with ape-man and actress-girl? Marcel, go to the workshop and make a splint. This boat has a captain and it's not you. Marcel, can you please go... I'm fine, I'm fine... Don't talk nonsense. What can you do like that? What's going on? Yes, every... Don't worry. It's fine. We'll start over. Minor hiccup. I'll strangle him. Okay, let's start again. Positions, please. Help him up! It's marvelous, kids! No, it's not marvelous. There's someone hurt. There's someone hurt. We have to amputate. Get moving. What's taking so long? - Come on, everyone. - Here we are. Take it up a level. Ambulance, fireman, hospital. Only the best for Chris. Treat him like a prince! Goddammit! This guy is a prince! "Mr. Chris" deserves the best. So call that guy! And keep me posted minute by minute. What guy? Where you going? No, I'm here. Can ape-man go into his cage? - Yes. - No, no. We've waited 2 months for the real ape. Enough! The real ape? The real ape is on the way. What real ape? And with what money? We want guarantees now. Call Pelissier. I want to hear. There you go. Now you're talking. He's right. Get it off your chests. Everyone, let it all out. Shut up. Excellent. Rehearsals are over until we get paid. Exactly. What do you mean, Marcel? - Strike. - Not the day before we open. Okay, let's all calm down! Let's have a coffee. You're really leaving? I'm doing my job. He wants an ape. What are you talking about? Stop! - Leaving? - No, Pat. You're a genius. Forget about the ape! I'll deal with it. I'll make some calls. You can't call. It's too late! Let's be real, see people. Touch, talk, discuss, have a drink. Have a drink with who? Talk to who? You don't get it! - Why are the doors locked? - You said to. Why do you always do what I say? Are we done? Can I go? If we don't get Ingrid's check, we implode. You understand? The show is over! I'll see Ingrid Pelissier, okay? Don't be a drama queen. What's the problem? Does she live too far away? It's too humiliating? Just relax. I'm on my way. Good luck! Remember I can't work late. Nathan will be very upset. Nathan? Nathan. My son. Your godson. He's 7 today. I made cheesecake. Jesus, Nathan is 7 years old. Time really flies. Give him a kiss from godfather. What do I do? Just go home. Ask him. Excuse me. Come here, bar intern. - Google... - What? Google... "monkey, trainer, emergency, help." Why me? You're here. I have no internet. I can't work late. Give me that. Where is he going? Did he say anything about me? Like what? You're so lucky to work with him. Search "ruf-ruf", "meow-meow". What a guy. We serve no purpose and he keeps us. Hello, miss. I'd like to speak to Theo Saporos. "Dogs-Cats-Monkeys for Films-Videos-Commercials". Yes... Sarapos. - Is this for my internship? - Totally. Get in. How can I reach your boss? I can't stay late. I said to get in. Careful, she's into me. Actually it's a bit of an emergency. Hello, gorgeous. Hello, commandante. - Where are we going? - High society. Ever heard of Ingrid Pelissier? Paris belongs to us. Why are we here? Most beautiful sunset in Paris. Yeah. Are we taking a pause? Calling it quits? Where does Ingrid Pelissier live? Parc Monceau. Just think... An ape is about to meet us and he doesn't know. - How about your crew? - Don't worry. In an hour we'll be back with part of their pay. It's Saturday night in Paris. Let's not hole up. - In fact... - I have to go. My babysitter is leaving. Married with kids? No, a civil union. But I have a son, Gaspard. My neighbor helps out. - Gaspard? - He's 6 months. My partner works tonight. - A civil union? - Jean-Bernard prefers, for taxes. I don't get it... Jean-Bernard? That can't be his name. Where's the problem? Are you serious? - What? - Too perfect. His name is Jean-Bernard? There are parents who say "My son will be called Jean-Bernard"? We call him JB. Okay, then! Big difference. Why tell me where he is? To make me happy. Exactly. If you knew me better, you wouldn't want to. You're smiling now. She's smiling. How? You think I don't see you? The Pont Alexandre III. Thanks so much. It'll be our little secret. I'll take you to dinner at the circus. It worked? You found him? And he has an ape? Not any ape. A star. The ape from that deodorant ad with Depardieu. Aren't we getting your money now? Excuse me, guys. The trailer of the great Theo Sarapos? Okay. He's obviously a star. - Why are we here? - It's on the way. Excuse me, gentlemen. The way to what? I'm the former owner. I'm doing a walk-through. None of you needs me. Life's a bummer. So... What about Pelissier? Anyone see a guy with an ape? I'm busy. Ask them. - You're not Theo Sarapos? - Nope. Hello, sir. I'd like to paint you. Miss, excuse me... Theo Sarapos' trailer? - The animal guy? - Yes. He must be in makeup. Thanks... Nice earbud. I was thinking, if you had two... you'd have a pretty pair of buds. And we laughed and laughed... Why didn't you see to this earlier? How can Chris survive without work? - And an ape... - Requires care! Is makeup in here? My uniform. It's me. It's Granny! Who is that asshole? I'll wait here. Make it fast. Don't remember me? Yes. Just remind me... No. But I do. I haven't forgotten. I auditioned for you 3 years ago. I had a Siamese cat. A dream feline. Smart, sweet... clean as a whistle. You never called back. - Fuck... - Yeah, fuck. That's your game? You breeze in, shake the coconut tree, and bingo, down the hatch? Guess again, pal. See this? Just that. 10 years of my life. Just that. Lighting a fucking cigarette. 10 years. Wake up at 6. Train from 7 to 11. After that she bites. Train again from 3 to 7. Till you want to sob, or puke. Or shoot her. Yeah... wow. You showbiz guys got it good. Nice tux. What's on for tonight? An exhibition? A cocktail party? A premiere? Can I come? Stick my ape up your ass. Think twice next time. Improv doesn't always work. Time to grow up. Theo, go home. They cut the ape crap. - Meaning? - We don't need Lisette. What the fuck? Beat it! Is it you? Is it you who cut my ape? You better watch out! You have no idea who you're messing with! No idea! You're lucky you got glasses! Hands off! You'll never forget this! Excuse me. - You're with Luigi? - For work. Theater de l'Etoile. I intern for the Pelissier Group. Next week, food processing. The Theater de l'Etoile... It's a miracle it stays open. What are we waiting for? So it's a no go. We can go home. Good evening... Yes, and you? Mommy! An ape! Yes, it is. You're a very clever boy. - Is he nice? - No, ma'am. Not at all. Why don't we run? Why? What did we do wrong? Wild animals belong to no one. Weren't we supposed to get the money first? Yeah, we're going. Think about others. She lived in a cage for years. She wants to live it up, have a drink in a hip bar. Taxi! Here. Don't mention it. Michel, give me change for 300 euros. Michel... stopped working here on April 3, 2003. Time really flies. Pat, you visited Japan, didn't you? No. My wife's cousin often goes to Japan. She likes planning trips. She really likes it. I hear it's very, very pretty. You have to be into it. But they work hard there. They're workaholics! Their suicide rate... Sky high. WHERE TO TAKE AN APE IN PARIS... Aline! Sweetheart, can you cash this for 200? Small bills. So I'll call you tomorrow? It's Sunday. I'm in weekend mode. Go to your personal office, maybe even use your smartphone to consult my account. I can't. If you do, increase my overdraft by 50,000. I can't. I'm just an account manager. I don't make big decisions. The realm of the impossible! Like magic. My daily life is magic. Every day I pay 27 salaries. What do I do? I just do it. I ask you to come along. Take my hand. Let's traverse the night of indifference. Abandon fear and cast off all limits. But an account manager has limits. It's glorious. He's an account manager! Reason to rejoice! Lucky you! Fate took me elsewhere. An appointment with your banker here? Appointment? Are you crazy? Pure chance. Hey, guys! That's what I call management! Relax! Feed her, then I'll go lick Pelissier's ass. I have my babysitter. Beautiful, a mommy in the night. Is anyone going to keep us informed? Lovely. I get spit in the face for barely 1,000 euros a day. 1,000 euros a day? How did you meet JB? You really care? Not at all. I really couldn't care less. It's just to be polite. Idle chitchat. Filler. If we don't talk, life is endless. For months he sat next to me at college, scared to look at me. It's so cute, I have chills. Think I'm a stereotype? That only your way of life is cool? I don't lie to my best friend. I never lie to Nawel. I like to surprise her. SAFETY CURTAIN Good evening, you've reached Luigi... Know the difference between an ape and Leonardo de Vinci? No. Ever see an ape paint the Mona Lisa? Incredible. Thank you... It's amazing. You get it? Yeah. Do you get it or not? Seriously, an ape can't paint the Mona Lisa. It's too hard. It's based on reality. She didn't get it. Because it's funny. He was telling you a joke. To make you laugh. - Explain. I'll be back. - I got it. I'll leave you to... It's not monkey business. It's a joke! But believe me, an ape can paint. Nawel? Our family has grown bigger. No, I haven't seen Ingrid yet. No, it's fine with her. I'll go shortly. I couldn't call you! What? Tell me now. Okay, then meet me at the bar on rue Princesse. On rue Princesse. I'd rather hear bad news in a nice place. Princesse! I don't know... Google Maps. From the verb: I Google-Maps, you Google-Maps, he/she/it Google-Maps! You can train an ape however you want... It's important to know how to mourn. Look. Good ad campaign. She's dead. We killed her. We barely knew her. It's as if we broke a vase. And you know, apes... Seen one, you've seen them all. We'll buy another one. Life goes on. Find it funny? - It doesn't. - Not really. Know the African proverb? No. "An ape that dies is a forest that's reborn." "An old man who dies is a library that burns." Of course. That's it. Of course that's it. What's the connection with the ape? What are you saying? Clara gets 1,000 per rehearsal? When do you see Pelissier? Couldn't you call me? Where were you? What do you mean our family got bigger? - Who negotiated Clara's contract? - You. Me? What got into me? Couldn't you stop me? What a bitch. Who's a bitch? 1,000 a day. What a bitch. Don't say that! Who are you people? And you keep quiet? Poor old Pat won't eat his frozen mincemeat. His what? Frozen mincemeat. His frozen mincemeat. Why frozen mincemeat? - It's what he eats. - Frozen food? - Mincemeat. - Pat? - Why frozen mincemeat? - He has bad teeth. - So he eats frozen mincemeat? - Daily. Who cares if Pat eats frozen mincemeat every day? Enough! Your crew of 18 won't show up tomorrow night. Go and get the damn check! Excuse me... I won't spend my nights in fancy bars! Go kiss Pelissier's ass and text me when Marcel is calm! Marcel? What about Marcel? Here, sir. Will you be okay? Just fine. Chris! You need me. Are you leaving? I was going home, but... They said to rest up if I act tomorrow. Forget it. Take care. Don't worry... Forget about it. Should I call a girl? Where are you sleeping? Forget it. No way! You're using the theater checkbook? Did he write a lot of checks tonight? I don't know. You really want to screw us over. Give me the checkbook. It was the last check, I swear. Goodnight, Chris. Keep me posted? You got a buddy in this city, 24/7! My God! No one said you were here! I'm not staying. Damn, you're funny... Miss... In love? No. How are you? This is the man who managed to bring Dazai the Grand back to Paris! How's it going? Selling any tickets? Full house. Two people to a seat. Great news. You reassure me. If only you knew how nasty people are. Hear that, bitch? The Etoile is sold out! I guess... I can't ask you to accompany me. I'll beg the old biddy alone. Thanks a lot. What did I say? What's wrong? You can ask for anything. I'll always be here for you. But once a year, one fucking time... My son needs to feel I'm there for him, available, on time! I'm sorry, forgive me. Go to your birthday party. Sorry. I'll go have a drink. Sorry. Enough with your bullshit apologies. You're not sorry. You don't care! I'm with you day and night, constantly doing damage control. This is another whim. You just think it's more fun to go there with me. Sorry, tonight my son comes before work. Your work? You and I are just a work relationship? Fuck you. I'm taking 10 years of paid vacation tonight. - That's my drink. - Sorry. WHERE TO FIND AN APE IN PARIS AFTER 8 Marcel lives in Montreuil. For your general culture, come see the burbs. Isn't it more logical to get the money, then see Marcel? No. What matters is that Marcel trusts me. It's about pride. A guy thing, high fives... Have you taken a look at Marcel? A good look. Not the kind of guy you want to disappoint. I've called Pelissier 10 times today. Nawel doesn't understand. She thinks I always get by, that I'm irresistible. Shit! There he is! Let's beat it. Luigi? Isn't he the ape guy? - Maybe. - Why here? Keep calm. - He saw us. - Yes, but no. Yes, he did. - I said keep calm. - I'm calm. - You aren't. - This isn't my problem. - Don't be mean. - I'm not. - Very mean. - I'm normal! - Your normal tone is mean. - Butt out! Listen to yourself. - Spare me! - Don't be pushy! That way? No, this way. Luigi! Do something. She's gone! Lisette isn't in the trailer! 10 years of my life down the drain! Where is she? Tell me... No idea. How should I know? I'm sorry. - I'm lost. - He came by the theater. I knew we'd bump into you. I have a knife. Isn't it a beauty? A real Apache knife. It's beautiful. Theo... it's a beautiful knife. But I think... Look at me. It's best to tuck it away. Nice and easy. Good boy. We're very, very proud of that knife. You know, if she left, she left. You mustn't say that. - Think she'll come back? - Dunno. She won't, but it's no big deal. Because you're young. You'll meet other ones. Where can we drop you off? Just drive. I'll let you get to know each other. Give us 5 minutes. Who "us"? Guess. Come on. Evening, gentlemen. Which door is for Marcel Griaule? Maybe. What is it? No maybes. Which one of the two? - Is there a problem? - None! I know it's nearby. All I remember is that there was a wall with very clever-looking guys standing in front of it. Yes, I think so too. Faeza? How are you, Lea? What's up, cuz? You haven't run away yet? Why haven't you gone to America? Nothing to do here... Hi there! Are you doing well? Tell the guys to do that. How are you? "I'm in love"... Just don't tell your parents. Get your asses out of here! How are you doing? Great outfit! I won't stay long. Is Marcel back yet? Is there anything to drink? Just a glass of... Like you, Mammy, a double scotch. Water? It's Christmas time! I'll be right back. What's going on here? How's the dance? Yes, a civil union. I have a baby. - With a boy or girl? - With a boy. A civil union isn't real. It's a fake marriage. A pretend marriage. I'm doing an internship with the Pelissier group. It's a corporation with lots of companies including the theater that Luigi runs. Daddy's home. Let me get up. Honey, Marcel is back. Marcel. Why are you here? To ask about welfare benefits? Where's Luigi? Grandma lost him. Is he your daddy? No, not yet. Nawel threw in the towel? Now you were sent to make us plebs cry? I'm all ears. I'll be blunt. Diplomacy isn't my thing. Here, I made it. Beautiful! - Who's that? - Luigi. It's like a photo. Who's holding the knife? Mommy. It's gorgeous. Really pretty. Is it for me? Really? Can I keep it? It's bedtime! - We're not tired. - Bedtime! Move it. Luigi's worse than my brother. He answers only to one thing. Threats. If we give in, we die. No saying no to him. So once in a while I show my fangs. Once, that son of a gun somehow found out I was going to lose my home. I was a gambling addict then. He showed up one morning, hungover. He handed me 15,000 euros in a paper bag. So I wouldn't thank him, he was vile to my family! She was showing me her dance! It was a dance. Marcel! Come here! He was with Lea in her room. He was in her bedroom. She showed me her dance. She's 15! Come on, Marcel! Fuck! Put 2 months' pay in my mailbox, and flowers for the ladies, or stick opening night up your ass. - What got into you? - What? You can't help it. She's 15! How pathetic! What? You're disgusting! He was singing your praises! My daughter is 15 too! What the hell? They're the same age! Why were you in her room? In her room? She was proud to show me her N'dombolo. What do I do? What's N'dombolo? Congolese dance. There are many kinds. It's like Ivory Coast Mapuko. Twerking. - There's the coup√©-d√©cal√©. - Not tonight. Come on. We'll go and get the money. Happy now? Parc Monceau. I want to hug my son. Fine, then. Stay here. Can we get moving? Have fun. A purple cape with stars on it. And a hat. - Magic! - With stars? Really! What kind of tricks did he do? - With a box. - Yeah, the one with the box. And then he did a trick with cards. It's wild. For 10 years, an ape and I were husband and wife. The Jardin des Plantes. She was born there. Maybe she fled to her childhood cage. - I spent my life on her. - Pull over. Aren't we getting the check? Yes, of course. My mistake. Parc Monceau. The first time we met... Enough. Tell him the truth. Enough! Pull over here. One ape here must want to act. Know what I wanted to do before training animals? - Who cares? - He asked me. Stand-up comedy! A one-man show. Poitou donkeys! I'm telling you... since you run a theater, you may be interested. My dad and I used to feed them carrots. I'll meet you down there. Often on film sets, when I bring animals, people ask if I'm an actor. Isn't that a sign? Which way for the apes? I began writing ages ago. If only I had more time. Damned animal... Now I'm almost done. "Theo Sarapos, Alone on Stage and in Life". That's the title. It rocks, doesn't it? At one point in the show... Not funny? Yes, hilarious. Why don't you laugh? Good evening. Where's Luigi? Were you with him when Lisette vanished? - Freeze! - Hands up! It's not like anyone died! We all get in trouble. We were all 14 like her. We all wanted to climb walls. She's different from us, not an uptown girl. She was born into a life of graffiti and rap music. She likes to knock down walls. Listen, this time I'll cover for her. I manage a theater, and not just any theater. Drop it. Come and see Galabru tomorrow. It'll be some show! Galabru is at his peak... Theo Sarapos. The gentleman whose hair is a bit... customized. Faeza Taieb. Here she is. She's sorry she exists. Check vivarium. You won't press charges? What charges? You must meet famous people. Famous people? Yes, we're pretty spoiled. Catherine Deneuve... Nice girl? Very. Such a natural girl. A girl who is... She's just real. With Catherine, we're real, she's real. If we're not real, she stays really real. I'll have no record? Don't get your hopes up. Louis Steiner. Here he is. Louis? She was on that show. About animals, the other night. Really? Doesn't surprise me. They showed her saving hurt animals. - That's her. - Puppies with broken legs. She tended to them... She's someone who can't stand to see animals suffer. It's really as if... People don't know this. People today stay holed up at home. Vivarium... check. You won't keep our names on file? We won't waste any more of their time. They have work. Thank you for your hospitality. Photo souvenir? Of course. Come on, everyone. Smile a little. - Closer together. - Move in. Great pic, thanks. We have to keep one of you. We can't release everyone. We told our superiors. You can't leave us-empty-handed. We'll leave him. This man will stay. Eeny-meeny-miny-mo. Good idea. - Why me? - Easier for everyone. Not for me. Don't hurt him. We know about zoo police brutality. Sir. In some countries animal trafficking gets you life. It's easy to laugh at everything. You ever send out resum√©s or go for job interviews? Do you know what it's like? Who can get a job with a record? Come on, take it easy. Neither of us has a record! You're so serious! The kind of girl who knows what she'll be doing on January 12, 2034 at 12:35. January 12, 2034, after 15 years at my company, I'll be on a ski vacation. By booking in September, I'll get 30% off. At 12:35 we'll go to the cafeteria before the lines get long. I'll be finishing my fondue, and fuck you. It's like the coup√©-d√©cal√©. What? The N'dombolo is part twerk, part coup√©-d√©cal√©. A Congolese dance. Think she's really upset? Who? - Marcel's daughter? - No, not her. Nawel. She won't talk to me. How many people at the office? Fine... I want to know every name and what time they leave. Because this is very serious. I'm going to lose it! Fuck all of you! I'd never vacation with him. Are you in show business? I'll be quick, honey. I'll talk to him... Give me the phone. Jean-Bernard? I'm your common-law spouse's boss. Is baby Gaspard all alone? We'll figure this out. I know, she's no piece of cake. We'll send her back home. It's all done. JB adores me. No, thanks. Don't let him harass you. Thanks, but no flowers tonight. Never give in. No is no. We like you, but it's no. Okay? You're still here? No. Just one portion. Want some wine? I can't hear you! Put in your hearing aid! It's your fault. You hide all my things! You're going too far. I'll pour you some red. I don't want any. Pain in the ass! I want white. You're a real pain! - Damn you! - Damn you too! For 40 fucking years, you've driven me crazy! Which is Ingrid Pelissier's? The big one? I can't believe we're here! It's magical. Sorry I'm not blas√©. Tell Jean-Bernard all about it one day. JB... Lovely evenings by the fireplace. Retirement lasts long. You don't even annoy me anymore. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Like the flowers? They're magnificent. Good evening. Thanks. I'm not going. I can't. It's visceral. - What? - I can't go inside. I can't beg from someone who said no. Humiliation has limits. It's not pride or arrogance. I just can't! Are you okay? Yes, but what can I do? Get on my knees and beg? I'm not a teen. I'm an adult. I'm an adult! I run a company. 27 people work with me, count on me, trust me. Sorry, this doesn't concern you. Can you call Nawel? No, wait a second. Shall we go? More flowers? We really have everything we need. Waiting isn't a bad thing. Standing in line like everyone else. It keeps your ego in check. Can we talk, one parasite to another? Oh, it's you. Is all well? She promised the theater to me too. Every day for 10 years I'd take her to the hairdresser. I'd wait, leaf through the magazines... tell her she was beautiful, that I wanted to fuck her. She would laugh. She was happy. In 10 years, she gave me one gift. If tomorrow flops, you can have the theater. Go fuck yourself. Loulou! If you came to squeeze me, don't bother. Look! He brought me flowers. How sweet. She's gorgeous. Your new Nawel? Like a Gauguin! More like a Gericault. No, a Gauguin. Beauty nowadays! Tell me, Dazai really speaks no English? Who do I seat him next to? After the show, don't let his groupies hang around. We can't eat at midnight. Thank you, Razou. What credit line did the bank give you? I have to check. How does the box office look? What's your estimate? - I guess... - I'm not asking for a guess! I'm talking about money. Money! Don't act childish. Anything else to tell me? I'm with friends. It's sort of delicate, Ingrid, but tonight... Darling, don't use that tone. It doesn't suit you. It's over. The bank is closed. Figure it out. Stick to your budget. Sergio, get going. Your taxi is here. Don't answer. It's fine. Not answering your boss? Naughty girl. You're not answering. It's just that... I need the priority code for a taxi. I thought you might know it. You're not picking up. Call me back. I'll be right back. Where are you going? I forgot about an appointment. An appointment? What was that about? I lent him a sweater. I was going to take it. Where is it? I left it with him. He needed it. Coming? What the hell? You can't leave a baby alone! I'm doing my best. Stop bugging JB! There's no use blackmailing me. I said I'd be 15 minutes. Got 500 euros? Yes, I do. Will you take a check? I'll fill in the name. This is more important than your party. Fill in the amount too. I know I promised. Okay, I'll hurry up. What are you doing? Paying his expenses and everyone's salaries. With bad checks? Now I have 24 hours. So that's your thing? You help your employees by buying time? You improvise, you wait, you buy time. Tell Marcel I'm not upset. Here. What? You really think he wants to see me? Get going. So you're asking me to bring bad checks to people who trust you blindly and who I don't know. - That's right. - At 2 am. You'll be perfect. Let them scream, listen... Show them it hurts you too and give an occasional smile. Kindly, humane, tender... - That's how you do it? - For 15 years now. You don't give a fuck about anyone. After 15 years of devotion, you just use them. You're a loser. Cynical, manipulative. A piece-of-shit boss. You okay? This isn't at all what you think. Give me the checks. I'll distribute them while you babysit. I'll never be able to. Luigi sent me. We've been through such crazy stuff together. Good evening. 2 minutes. Just hear me out. Come inside. This is Mr. Pat. And that's me. I was young and handsome. - It's Luigi! - He's kissing me. Faeza told me to come. She forgot to tell you. How do you know her? She's someone I know well. We hang out, I call her, "Hi, Faeza", she answers. Not only her, but... her husband... JB... his initials, short for Jean-Bernard. They're people I see over weekends at their place or mine... miniature golf, nonstop laughter... They asked me to help out tonight baby-wise. What happened to your face? What happened? It's a wound, a bruise... Man-to-man combat. I'd rather not discuss it. We all have our demons. I'm a... If the child needs a meal, count on me. I'm licensed to do so. I deal with children all the time. I have a nursery school in... If ever I'm required to make pasta... He's 6 months. That's young. We'll make stuff that's water-based. More child-friendly. Are you really okay? I'm great. I'm doing wonderfully. Chris, what's going on? Shit. I can't believe it. Outside, this late. At that age. He ordered room service an hour ago. The waiter knocked, but no one answered. We were afraid to go in ourselves. We wanted your okay. Here she is. Solange, a chambermaid. She loves babies. Uncle Luigi will be right back. Go with this nice lady. He must be hungry. I'll take care of him. Don't breastfeed him in public. Open it. Please... a girl. Bring me a girl. A girl's round, tender knee. I want to breathe in its scent. I know. The night before we open, I'm... I want to kiss the dimple of the knee... as it bends... I have the ape. I found it. And this ape is... magnificent. I don't give a damn about the ape. I want a girl... I don't get every nuance, but we are as one. - Is anyone here? - I want a girl. Are you in great pain? Room service? A girl, you stupid idiot! This must be divine punishment. I was too spoiled. All my life I've been surrounded by grace and intelligence. And now I am going to die in the arms of an idiot. I like you a real lot too. Help! Why are you here? I came as quickly as I could. Tough luck... Yeah, tough luck. Listen, now he's up above... with the Bearded One. If He exists. Maybe happier than us. Who's she? This is Monique, a friend. We're not machines. After effort comes comfort. You know, my Granny died two years ago. Two years ago. Just like yesterday. Think about yourself now. Try to enjoy life. No harm in a little fun. Stop it, okay? Stop! I didn't ask for anything. Beat it! - Yeah, I'm exhausting. - What? I'm exhausting, I know. - Let's go to the theater. - Leave me alone! - To be with Monique? - Screw Monique! I want to be with no one. Except your pal Chris. Stop it. Honestly, I swear... I've had enough. You're right. And I know you're saying it for my own good. When I see myself in the mirror, I want to puke. Can I give you a ride? Sir? The kid? Shit... I'll take care of this. Good evening, Roger. Where did you get this angel? He's Faeza's son. I'll explain. I'm not sure I really want to know. - Did he eat? - Yes... I don't know. - She knows he's here? - Yes... We just need to tell her. I tried calling her a lot. I'll text her. Roger, I need your help. Can you take him? Can you fill me in? Do you have coffee or aspirin? Sorry, I had no time to buy a gift. You can spare me those remarks at 3 am. You don't care about your godson. No use pretending. That's not true. It isn't? What grade is he in? His favorite games? Stop it. You see, when you start treating me like a dumb bitch... I feel like calling it quits. Working with normal people. - Nice people. - I'm nice. Yes, I am. You didn't do what you promised. Marry me. Marry me. I know it's late. I should have asked you 10 years ago. This time I'm serious. I know, you didn't want to be alone. You married Roger. He's nice. But let's stop lying. You can't stay married to a guy who's more of a friend. Nawel... We'll have a big house. Lots of windows, a swing... Roger can lunch with us on Tuesdays. Let's be brave. This is our truth. Nawel, our time has come. He's hungry. Straight ahead. Then left. We like you a lot. But now it's bedtime. Here I am! Can you come back tomorrow? I'm tired. Here I am. I understand, but I want to be alone. Okay? I'm going to bed. I have to go to bed. Because I sleep here. Stop it now. Goodnight and good luck. Pat? Who is it? Who is that? Why didn't Mr. Pat answer? I've been waiting. You stayed here all night? I waited for you. Beautiful, a theater in the night. I was in your office. I saw your bed, your sheets. I looked around, understood things. Women can sense those things. I saw your pictures. Your papers. I know you need me. And now I'm here. I'll be right back. Just roll out of bed? We haven't seen much of you recently. Hi, Daddy. Hi, honey. Mommy's not home? She went to the market. Are you done with breakfast? What's that? Is it the neighbor? It's just someone. Anonymous. How's school? It's fine. - Hi, Dad! - Hi, honey! Funny seeing you so early. Yes, it's a change. How are you? Fine and you? I'm going to see friends. - You're pretty. - What's that? Nothing. - You okay? - Fine. - I'm leaving. - I'm going to nap. Jacques is in there, sleeping. Bye, Chlo√©. Jacques? Who's he? Chlo√©... I have to run. Won't you stay with me? It doesn't matter, Daddy. - Have a nice day, honey. - You too. You know I love you. Clara! Can I have an autograph? Break a leg tonight. Hi, Pat. I realized you just have to say yes for us to sleep together. Yes... Life hangs by a thread. Youth... Ladies and gentlemen, you are kindly requested to shut off your cell phones. We're on. Faeza! How are you? Here she is! The elite of the nation. Still walking around with bad checks? I left mine on the boss' desk. I can fight at night and show up the next day. It is time, it is time to give her the liquid with the steely syringe. Luigi? I'm trying to read Dazai's notes. I got promoted again. Is it normal to perform without him? Normal or not, no turning back now. So? How was Paris by night? My son would love us to watch Gaspard again. If you don't take him bar-hopping! Come, it's almost over. I have to give Luigi my notes. He's not inside? Never on opening night. That surprises me. Why? Thought you knew him? Hear that? They're wild about me! I prefer to wait here. OPEN AT NIGHT
