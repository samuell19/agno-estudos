Rome, November 1979 Crime was my profession. I was driven by a special force that propelled me from behind, hungry for prey and violent like a caged animal. I was ready to attack the city. Maurizio could steal and drive any car. If he'd been braver and luckier, he'd have been a racing driver, but like us, he hadn't been, so he became a talented car thief. He could steal up to ten a night and he received more orders than anyone else. I asked him to be my driver. It's risky. I felt excited, like a hunter. I scoured the pavements and streets looking for targets. - The BMW, he's rich. - Let's get him. I had a new engine put in, I didn't like the other one. - It's not very stable, d'you feel it? - Yes, but go faster. - Goddamn him. - We'll get him, where's he going? Roberto lives in the hood too, but he's worse off than us. He shares a hovel with his wife and son and he's broke, he's already been inside. In '78, for 18 days, they were Moro's kidnappers so they arrested me. I didn't give a damn about Moro, but I had some tyres in my car. - I asked him to work with me. - Your kind of work always pays. Roberto did it for the money, not for the glory. For me it was different, it was at war. - Give me all you've got. - Why? - Or there'll be a massacre. - I'm a journalist, I understand... Give me all you have, hurry! No funny business, hurry up! - Help! - Where the fuck are you going? Come here! Get out! Move it! Stay there, don't move. Don't move. I said don't move! Get out, get out! - Come on! - Get out! - Call the police! - Make them shut up! Let's go! Come on, let's go! Too many people, too many witnesses, they're after us now, that wasn't a goddamn street, it was a fucking trap! We did it, guys. Afterwards, when the fear was gone, I always felt a surge of confidence. They met the same end as other idiots. I'd go home feeling good, lucid and invincible. Shit, blood. Each time I'd lose some blood or get stained with that of the victims. I didn't care, I was scared and wanted their money. Men or women, it made no difference, they were prey and we thought they'd been luckier than us even though we never said it. I wished every robbery could be done in silence. I wished the pact of steel we proposed to them would always work: We've got the gun, give us your money and no one'll get hurt. We have to go and get the money, from people's houses, but we need smart and tough people to do that. I have no idea what'll happen once we get in. I get it, Remo. But I wanted to have a break. I've got a bit of money, but I can always get you a car... I'll still manage to get by. That's what Maurizio was like, he wasn't reliable. I busted my brains to try and up the level of action but he didn't care and he'd just disappear, then come back when he wanted. He robbed only to fund his high life. Remo, this is Rita, she works with Teresa. MARCO LORUSSO (Bully boy) Bully boy was the fourth oldest kid out of 12. His folks had come from Puglia in the 50s and had set up home in a hovel on the edges of town amidst fields and piles of burning waste. As a kid he worked with his dad and brothers, collecting all kinds of refuse the city produced, including foil milk bottle tops. Then they started collecting unused cars and they set up a scrap yard selling spare parts. The birth of the working-class suburb industry. - Why don't you ask him? - Who, Bully Boy? - Just for a while, then I'll be back. - He's no good, he's crazy. This place is full of chicks, shame you don't get to screw any. Shame that because of the way you walk you deserve a six-month jail sentence. Look how you're dressed... you're such a bully boy! And you're a pain in the ass! - You could at least say sorry! - You're right. Sorry. It ended up being just me and Roberto, we went out with his Fiat 124. - Christ, you killed him. - No, I didn't. His car's still going. Too much trouble, too much shooting. The news said I'd shot him in the nose, I had to choose my targets better and be more careful, I had to scare them, but also reassure them, not make them panic. Go, go! Get her fur coat! Move it. My friend's nasty, but give us all you've got and it'll be over. - Say yes. - Yes. - What's up? - Nothing. Cops. Get in the car. Get in the car! Hello. - Flying squad. - Okay. - Cold, isn't it? - A little. - Goodnight. So you're a cop. Why didn't you tell me? - Is your post here in Roma? - No, up north, I'm on leave. You know how many cops rob people in their cells? Without counting those who rob from drug dealers and fences. I didn't want to do this, but I need the money. - You chose to get married... - She was pregnant! Why did you start robbing people? You're right, you never know what'll happen in life. Some people drive fast and some open their parachute at the last minute. I'll choose how to die. You're nuts, you've never been inside, what the hell do you know? Time stands still in there. You just wait and wait. Don't tell me this is all you do in life! - Do you want rigatoni or spaghetti? - You see that girl over there? Not the blonde, the other one. - Who Rita? - I'd like to be served by her. Rita, see what this young man wants. Remo... did you come here to eat? - No, to see you. - To see me? - Sit down. - I'm not allowed. I'm allowing you. Just for a moment. I've been thinking about you lots, I couldn't resist any longer, I had to see you, I'm sure you know I fancy you. Don't you? Don't tell me you didn't know. No, actually, I didn't notice. Maybe when I fall in love, I become withdrawn. That should've told you something. I didn't realise you liked me. Don't you want to stay with me tonight? - What do you say? - I don't know, I'll think about it. - You don't need to, just say yes. - It's all been so quick... Don't go, wait. I'm not leaving until you give me an answer. - I've got enough supplies for a week. - You're not like the others. Of course, I'm more handsome. Idiot, I'm being serious, you're sensitive, sweet... I mean it. Get her bag! Help! - Face the wall! - Help! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Imagine if my wife got robbed like that. Remo, I'm through with this. No, it's not because of you. This is my last job. Here. I'm sorry, we made a good team. He wasn't scared, just ashamed when he robbed people. Unlike me, during robberies, he got emotionally involved. I went back to my job in Torino, I did some robberies there too, but I was always kept at the station due to disciplinary action. or at the hospital, 'cause I'd called sick. Sometimes my own thoughts made me ill. I'm fucking sick of this. Being bossed around all my life has made me ill, You'll always be bossed around, don't you get it? - Either by your wife... - Not all bosses can be bad. No, you don't know that, but so what? Look how they're hiding him, because no one must find out. - Officially, it was an accident. - Like fuck it was. He shot himself in the mouth, he wanted to die, he couldn't cope. We're working tonight, want to come out with me? How? I'll sneak out, that's how. Tell Esposito too, three's a better number. I gained a lot of experience in Roma, I'd surpassed them. They hung back during jobs. At work they always held me back or made me follow orders. They always made me guard the Shroud they say Christ was buried in. I don't believe it, but I still guarded it, ready to arrest the first madman who tried to do anything stupid. But I got arrested instead, for abandoning my post. I'll have you arrested, Guerra. I needed a bite to eat. With all those candles... You're a jerk, Remo. You need to get a life. Shut up or I'll arrest you too. Take that goddamn sandwich out of your mouth! They sent me to military jail in Peschiera. I got a four-month sentence but then I was released. I left my job and returned to Roma, my internal war was getting serious. He thinks he's the bees knees. How can you work with him? He's only good at stealing cars. Bully Boy was always hanging around me. He didn't ask to work with me, he wanted to be asked. You've not been in touch with Rita. - If you're through with her, tell her. - Call her. I was working with Maurizio again, he came and went, as usual, then he got a nasty chest infection. Working at night, in the rain, his body had packed up. I was forced to take on anyone available. Come on, or we'll lose him! Come on, give me the gun. Give me the goddamn gun. Mum, call the police! Let's go, come on! I said let's go! What the fuck are you doing? - Get in the car. - You made me piss myself. Give me a hand... What the fuck did you give me? It doesn't work! Now it does, goddammit! What the hell are you doing? Go back, I'll kill him! I need people who are of sound mind, understood? - Of sound mind? - I can't fucking work with you! - You know what I use the money for? - Tell me. I shoot up, that's what I do. I don't give a shit about the money. Bully Boy had learnt to mix Kung Fu with Karate in a messy, frenzied style. But he preferred head-butting people to break their teeth, which was neither Kung Fu nor Karate. We did some robberies together. He was smart and tough, he was never scared, his presence alone was intimidating. He never spoke and could strike fast and at the right moment. I didn't like him but I felt safe with him, maybe he was exactly what I'd been looking for. This swine's pissing himself. - Take a deep breath. - I'm dying. - I'm dying... - No, you're fine... It's all right, breathe deeply, go on. The first house robbery happened by chance. I decided on the spur of the moment because with Bully Boy I felt safe. Disable the alarm. If it goes off, shoot him. Their surroundings were far superior to ours, they emanated wealth, you could see they'd had an easy ride. The woman was pretty and sophisticated, not like Rita or Teresa, very different to the girls from our neighbourhood. Who else is here? Who else is here? My in-laws. She's ill. - I don't care. Wake them up. - Come on, move it. Don't move, get down, face to the floor and stay put. Don't move or I'll shoot you. - I can't breathe! - Shut up, sit down. - You have no right! - Will you shut up for once? - They've no right to rub us! - Can't you see that she's sick? Stop! Damn murderers, I'll have you both arrested. Shut up or I'll shoot your mouth off! Come on. - There's nothing there. - Shut up. Can I speak to my son-in-law? You're a jerk. I told you that goddamn Rolex attracted attention, jerk! Stay there! Each wardrobe I opened was a sacrilege for pert-butt. When she stopped gawping at me I knew nothing was left. In one clean swipe we got the equivalent of a few muggings. Maurizio got wind of things and reappeared. He was at the bar, he always found me there. He looked deep in contemplation, but maybe he was just staring ahead. He was broke, I gave him a cut of the takings but he needed to work. Maurizio wasn't as tough as Bully Boy, but we'd worked together for ages, I couldn't dump him. This was the boarding school I went to. - What was it like? - Nothing special. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. This was Maurizio's old school. I don't give a shit about who went to school here. We played football, sometimes they'd beat us... Were they priests? No, ordinary teachers. I was always by myself, I made a dent in that wall. But if I had the choice, I'd go back. - What the hell did you there? - I studied. You studied? I stuck it out till I was twelve. but maybe I was a dumbass. - Why? I'd read and read but I never remembered anything. What do you mean? Books, Bully Boy. I'd read books but never remember anything. - Ever read any books? - Books? - Yes, books. - No. - So piss off then. - Let's go, I've had enough of this jerk. - Let's get to work. - Yes, let's do that. Bully Boy always created a bad atmosphere like someone who casts their shadow even on a day without sun and I needed Maurizio to help me keep him at a distance. Meanwhile my name was becoming know in the neighbourhood. Round our way I was Remo, the ex-cop, the robber. The guys didn't talk about it but they said hi and hung around me. I was too conspicuous, I'd done around 200 robberies, I couldn't be me during the jobs, I had to be someone else. That was the point, I had to be someone else in the robberies. That steel tube breathed death, that barrel that almost reached your face symbolized death itself, much more than the gun alone. It's the silent arrival of death and a guarantee for who shoots it. Come on, let's get some stuff. - I'm Little Tony... - Back to the wall. You've already taken enough, the chain alone is worth 15 million. - Who's in the house? - My daughter and my husband. - I don't live here. - He mustn't meet my husband. I told him I'd gone to play bridge. Let's go out of here. Bridge, sit down and keep quiet. If he busts your balls, shoot him. Let's go to your husband. He gets carried away. - Oh God, I'm dreaming. - No, it's real, darling, get up. - You're here to rob us? - Yes, they're bandits. - Don't be scared, they'll go soon. - I'm not scared. I can talk to all people. I've got nothing against them. Have you been doing this long? I don't want to be a cop, but I want to know who you are, where you're from. Tony, cut the bullshit, sing me a song instead. Come on, you want me to sing now? Go on, sing... what's it called? "Cuore matto". I'll do the bass line and you sing. Go on. - Don't you remember the words? - You're crazy, they'll hear us! Nonsense! This house is a fortress, go on! Stop messing around. Sing, Tony. Sing. Do as I say and you'll be fine, give me your hand. Behind your back, come on. Did that singer come back? He had the cheek to come here? Tony, you don't get it, I want the bass line too. Don't disappoint me. Go, Tony! Was that out of tune? You try singing with a gun pointed at your face. You're making him sing, what are you thinking? Get up, move it. Shut up, sit down. - Tie them both up. - I don't want to be tied up. I don't give a toss, I'm already keeping this one hidden for you. Where's the safe? We're not a bank, we don't have one. - Okay, you can go now. - No, now we'll start from scratch. Where the fuck is the safe? - Baby, I'll leave you a scar. - No, please, wait! Wait! You're not a bank? You're better than a bank! Bulgari. I go nuts for gold! How the fuck did you get all this stuff? Halfcent was both happy and worried. This was expensive stuff but the diamond needed cutting, the chain dismantling, and the furs were tailor-made. This was becoming too big for us and for our neighbourhood. We'd robbed rich and powerful folks in a rich and important area. Those who lived in the poshest areas would eventually fight back, the rich know how to defend themselves. To Maurizio and Teresa, good luck to you! Hooray for the happy couple! Hooray! I don't understand, why get married? He's bone idle. He's spent a fortune on his honeymoon, he's going up north to lord it up. Hi, Remo. I've not seen you for a while. Hi, Rita. Well, bye then. Bye. Shall I cut the cake? I'll go ahead then. Let go! Let me in or I'll smash your head in! - Well? - I won't let you in! Leave him. - He doesn't want to let us in. - So you want to kill him instead? Bully Boy's foot was sore from where he'd kicked that man, god knows what happened to that guy... Even if no one'd heard us, we couldn't have entered his house, his family would've panicked. I had to prevent those reactions and Bully Boy's stubborn violence. The robberies had to go smoothly. I decided to take a break and have a change of scenery. To forget Roma and the neighbourhood, the guns and the disguises, also because I'd meet a girl. Michela was at university, I liked listening to her, but she asked too many questions. - Remo, how do you get by? - Like everyone else. Yeah, right... You show up, disappear, then return... Whenever I need you, I can't find you. - Do you really want to know? - Of course I do. You know sea folk have better eyes than others? Because of this immense space, without reference points. Your eyes have to work, just like a muscle when you exercise. - Mine are like that too. - Have you lived by the sea? No. No, I don't know why. I couldn't answer. I couldn't say that I'd got used to spotting danger, to seeing warning signs and about my underground life. Who the fuck's this? - Hello? - When are you coming back? - I just got here. - There's work to do, we need you. Maurizio's bought himself a yacht, now he's skint and needs to work. - We'll talk when I get back. - When will that be? I don't know, I'm staying here, I'll come when I'm done relaxing. - I'll come and get you. - No, stay there. Bully Boy called often and my criminal life was closing in on me. I started thinking I needed to break free from that life. My objective was to stop doing the robberies, but I didn't know how to do that. Remo! There's a great job to be done. We've come to get you. We need to talk. A jeweller in Latina, we'll enter his house, scare his family, then me and you will go to his shop. If he does anything stupid, we'll kill one of his family. We'll communicate via radio. - Radio? - We'll bring some. We'll empty his safes and we'll be rich. - Whose idea was it? - We came up with it waiting for you. - He told me you've got a yacht. - The idiot's got a lover too. Her name's Alice, her dad runs the dance hall. Really? What about Teresa? What does she think? She doesn't know. Roma was Grey and cloudy, I went back to robbing. I went back to carrying out our chilling attacks. - Hi, how are things? - Good, how are you? What's up? Do you need money? I can help you out. There's a great opportunity. It's a bar near here, the owner's in debt and wants to sell. He wants 35 million, it's got a betting licence too. - Let's take a look. - It could be a real hotspot. It's in a great location, with parking. I can be the barman, I'll work 24/7. - Let's go take a look. - Let's go. Hi, Sauro, this is Remo, a friend of mine. He came to see the bar, he's really keen. You worked hard to make it so shabby. It's a bit neglected. - It's not that bad. - A lick of paint. With a couple of million, some modern lighting, you'll get plenty of punters. Loads of youngsters hang round here just waiting... You know what for? To come here... ... and spend all the money they have. Who'll get that money? You will. If you've got some money, invest it here. - How much is this palace? - Thirty-five million. But he'd settle for 30. Yesterday someone offered 40, with 10 in cash. Who? Angelone? Don't listen to him! He's got no money, he can't afford it! We'll buy your bar, with cash, and immediately, right? - Let's drink to it, come on. - No, let me do some sums. Let's do some sums before taking on his palace. It could've been just what I needed, I gave a deposit and asked for a month to decide. We visited suppliers and other related businesses, builders, carpenters, 40 or 50 million needed to be spent on doing the bar up. I don't know if I can do it. No, I can't afford it. - It's too much, I haven't got it. - Shame. - It's a golden opportunity. - He's right, it's a bargain. Fixing it up will cost more than the bar. Let's do some more robberies then. Right, more robberies... Take my share, then pay me back. No rush, I don't want anything in return. - You do nothing for free. - I just want to start working again. All he thought about was robbing, he was a born robber. The only thing he'd learnt was how to steal, wherever he could, whenever possible. In his own way, he was innocent, but I was less so. Every time I looked in the mirror, I was confronted by my image, I noticed my nose and the small white scars. I looked conspicuous, scarred, even though during the robberies I was disguised. If I had a coffee off the turf, I always parked far away. I was vigilant and I watched my back. I feared one of our victims would recognise me. These were the sort of people I targeted at night, I watched them and felt watched. Come on through, the doctor will see you now. - Hello, how are you? - Fine, thanks. - Have a seat. So, tell me, what's the problem? My nose, it's too... It doesn't suit my... I don't like it, that's what. What exactly don't you like about your nose? I don't know. I don't know. - What do you think, Mr Guerra? - Yes. It's all right, but I... I thought we could change my chin and cheekbones too. Yes, in actual fact you can. Here we've changed the chin and lifted the eyelids. Let's see the next one... Here we've made some more important changes. We changed the ears, the eyelids, the tip of the nose and we made the lips symmetric. That's great, perfect, it can be done. Yes, technically, it's doable, but it seems to me that you want to change your appearance. If that's the case, you need a different surgeon. The idea of changing my appearance gave me great hope for the future. I immediately went to find Maurizio and Bully Boy. There's nothing here! Where's the stocking? Who's got the stocking with the gold? I thought you'd got it. He'd untied himself, and answered the door. My friend left this behind. Tie him up again. I went from robberies to the bar, I never slept. I spent my days at the bar, training, my nights robbing, with the stress, the fear, selling the goods on then repeated it the next day, all at a crazy speed. Hundreds of kilometres a day. Don't untie yourself again, wait half an hour at least. Are you fucking sleeping? No, I'm not. We're working. I was beset by weakness, as if under the effect of an unknown poison. Once I fell asleep at the dentist's. "Relax", he said to me. I bet he'd never seen anyone relax so much. - Make it pop, won't you? - It'll hit neon lighting. Seen the heated pool table? It cost a fortune. - Wow... - It wasn't cheap, but worth it. The video poker machine's here for one reason. I'll come by at night and take what I want. - Don't disappoint me. - I've already lost 300,000 lire. Good, keep it up. I know where to find at least. - Why? - You'll be working here, right? No, Roberto will be here, I'm clueless. You could've sorted your hair out. Look at the state of it! Couldn't you have smartened yourself up a bit? I went to Gegè's, but he chucked me out. Roberto seemed happy, he served up drinks and one-liners to all. He kept it up when Bully Boy arrived. I'm impressed. The bar looks great, it must've cost a bomb. He was thinking of the robberies and the money I owed him. - Any sign of Maurizio? - No. Women are his downfall. I don't understand women. You can't stay here, scram. Remo, tell this lot to stay away. They're entitled to be here just like us, but if I catch you ordering stuff, I'll kick you out. We opened this morning, this isn't a drug den. - No, Remo, don't worry. - You're cool. We won't make trouble for you. I'd kick you out right away. Remo, great place! You're doing really well, good for you. Me too... you know the land I bought? I'm building a house there. Otherwise what's the point of working? I need to have a word. You know Attilio? Yes, I've seen him around. He's in a bit trouble. I lent him my car and he crashed into a tree. The car's a write off, and this son of a bitch didn't even get hurt. Now he has to pay me back but he's broke. I need to ask you a personal favour, take him to work with you. Remo... let me work with you, I need the money. You won't regret it, I'm good. Give him a gun and take him with you. You stink worse than a hooker! - Did you use the whole bottle? - No, why? Pull over here. Pull over. Get out. - Get out! - Come on, get out! We're going to do a robbery, not to a party. Go on. - Wash your hair! - This isn't cheap stuff! - Wash your hair! - It's cold! Attilio looked tough, with his shades and hollow cheeks but he was shit scared and his hands were shaking. Okay, take us to your house. No... They're all whores. Shit... It's dope. Unbelievable! Nice. It's good stuff. I assure you, they didn't rip you off, I'm an expert. Dad... ... you never told us you smoked. This is no time to start arguing. Is it black? Wait, don't tell me, let me try and guess what it is. - How much did we get? - Twenty years in jail! - I told you to stay with the woman. - She's next door, tied up. - What if she shouts out of the window? - You want us to run out shooting? You always come at night! - What did you bring me this time? - This one's dumber than a donkey. What's the problem? Kid, I vouched for you. I just smoked a joint. You get stoned on the job? He's a joke, all he can do is steal car tyres. He should be a rubbish-collector, that's all he's good for. All right, let's see the stuff. He still got his share, he'd taken a risk too, even if he'd nearly got us caught. But Halfcent gave him nothing, Attilio had to pay for the BMW. - Do you want the dope too? - What is it? Black. Smells good. I'll have it, I'll sell anything. Two days later the robbery was on the front page of the news. No mention of the hash, of course, but our physical features were described in great detail. We were described as determined, arrogant and violent. My psychological profile was also eerily close to the truth. The victim said I was a born leader and skilled at making decisions. Going by my actions, I may have worked in a military context. No one had come closer to the truth. - Someone's after you. - Who the fuck is it? They looked like cops, they asked about you and an Alfa... I wrote down the number plate. It was an Alfa Bully Boy had bought, but we'd hardly used it. How the fuck did they link that car to me? It wasn't the police, maybe they were carabinieri, but why? If it was about the robbery, they'd have arrested me. They came here too last night, they searched my dad's house. They were carabinieri, looking for drugs. - They're waiting for us to slip up. - Why fucking wait? I don't know. It must be because they're having problems. - Doesn't he ever stop? - My dad lives for his hammer. We'd reached the end of the line The rich and powerful, the society we'd attacked, were coming after us, they wanted to catch us. I felt they were letting me live just so they could suffocate me slowly. I managed to give them the slip but I knew they'd be back. Without realising, I'd ended up in Rebibbia, the game was over. We'd not done a job for ages. I desperately needed money to pay off the debts for the bar and give Bully Boy the 30 million I owed him. Do you still remember what to do? What's up? Enough, they won't give up until they find what they're looking for. Let's get rid of the guns and cars and lie low for a while. Where the fuck will we go? Not this one, I'm keeping it. I've got family in Australia, we can go there. What the fuck'll we do in Australia? We'll find work. We had our passports ready when I heard it was the Secret Services. My brother-in-law, a cop, told me that an official was investigating me in connection with a politician. You were seen with a wanted criminal, a terrorist. - Me? - Yes. They're nuts, I don't know any terrorist. Don't do anything stupid, I can't help you. I suddenly realized who'd dobbed me in, the idiot who'd sold me the silence. He worked locally, dealing arms, drugs and selling gold. When I met him, he was driving Bully Boy's Alfa, now I understood. Son of a bitch... I had to eliminate him. He was an informer for the Secret Services. I was excited, I wanted to meet them. My brother-in-law arranged it. The official was a beady-eyed carabiniere chief, shrewd and courteous, I told him about Giovanni the crook, he listened without saying a word. I'm no saint, but I don't see why you're so interested in me. I'm not a kidnapper or a terrorist. You've built a fortress around me, but you won't find anything. Mr. Guerra, we're interested in certain arms, in particular some MABs which went missing from the Navy. A right-wing terrorism racket. That's what the problem is. That son of a bitch had told them I was a big fish who trafficked arms and had important contacts. How's your bar doing? Is business good? I heard it's a very nice place, if I may say so. - Only debts, for now. - You're one of the neighbourhood. You meet lots of people, you must hear about things quite easily. We just need some reliable information. You were in the police, right? He wanted to get me onboard. I agreed to do it, but asked to be left alone. I meet him a couple more times, I had nothing or no one to sell him, even if I'd needed the money. I didn't go after Giovanni, but I made it clear I would if I got into trouble. They put less pressure on us then stopped altogether. They'd realized we weren't involved in terrorism and they didn't care about the rest. We got back on the job, I was eager to pay Bully Boy back his money. You see? It happens for real, not only in films, What the fuck are you doing? Stay put, understood? Or I'll blow your head off. Then what? Will you take everything? No, just what's in the house, you'll keep the best stuff, we just take the crumbs. I know real mafiosos, the ones who run Roma, leave while you still can. We got loads, go take a look. You take care of Al Capone. Come on, Al Capone. Well? We did well to follow that Porsche. We'll retire this time. You won't get away with this. I'll get my friends onto you, they don't mess around. First they'll get back all you've taken then they'll destroy you, I told your friend too. Of course, sure. They sparkled mysteriously, they were ancient gemstones, but they'd soon slip from our hands. We could never have kept hold of things like these. They were ours for a few hours, at dawn we'd take them to Halfcent and we minded a little. They'd be turned into money, less precious because you use it. Whereas they were eternal. Must be worth more than 100 million. Seen how they sparkle? No bullshit, they actually sparkle. They reflect light. Yes, they sure do. Stop! I'll get them, you park up. I paid Bully Boy back a large part of his money, I wanted to do a few more jobs, earn another 50 million or so and then jack it all in. But I had to act fast. Give me what you've got! The police is here, Nilde Iotti lives here! - Be quiet. - She's an important politician. Help, police! How the fuck did we know an important politician lived there? Put that gun down! Drop it! Stop! I couldn't go to a hospital in Roma, they'd have caught me, but if they didn't catch Bully Boy I could make it. I'd go to our emergency meeting, at the station, and with his BMW we'd be in Florence after two hours. Bully Boy could pretend to shoot me in town, in front of witnesses, and then disappear. "Who was it? I don't know." I'd be taken to hospital, I'd pull through. But right then I felt nauseous. - What's happened? - He's one of those wanted men. Rh-negative... take me to hospital. - I'll call the police. - Take me to hospital! - What happened? Did you fall? - He's dying. Get lost! Run or they'll catch you! Who shot you? I don't know. Guerra! After you. He's at the end. I've let you down? No, it's not that. Does your shoulder hurt? Maybe I should explain. What's there to explain... Maybe before, but now... Maybe I'll write you a letter. No, don't bother. I don't believe you anymore. You didn't trust me either. Remo, I'm not coming again. I'm not coming back here. Won't I see you again? No. It's for the best. Michela beat a fast retreat. I was looking at doing three years at least. Robbery, they said. I'd done hundreds of robberies, but hearing it felt like being crushed by a huge weight. I was alive and crushed. I had to do something, but I wasn't sure what. Then the judge put me on probation for health reasons. They'd reopened the investigation. They still had gaps to fill, like the missing accomplice. Here he is! - I told you that lawyer was good. - You're clueless about lawyers! Just listen to your friend Marco! - Listen to your friend Marco... - Open the bottle. Hooray! Easy, don't knock the glasses over. - Cheers. - Cheers! During my absence, the bar had gone downhill. Bully Boy wanted me to sell, so I could clear my debt with him. Remo, we're having a sandwich. Yes, goo idea! Remo, I need to ask you something. I know you can help us. We've got a job we want to do and we need something... ... that looks a bit scary, like... - A sawn-off shotgun. - Right, that's what I meant. - You got one? - Go home. - A rifle will do the job too. - I told you to go home. - We've got the money for you. - Go home. - How much do you want? - Go home. I told Remo, I can't stand that lot. - I can't stand them. - I'm going home. Shall we call it a night? It's early, let us finish the match, I want to thrash him. No chance! That was a tough period, Roberto did the morning shift and I did the rest, until two, or three in the morning. Dammit, you're so goddamn lucky! You're a lucky bastard! I worked and I was on my own, prisoner of the bar and neighbourhood. Remo, if you need money, just ask. Ten, twenty million, I'll see you, don't worry. I can lend you a few million too. Give us a couple of beers. Make it three, one for Attilio too. Bring us our fucking beers! Take no notice of him, he's a rogue. I haven't forgotten that I started out with you and that he didn't want me around. If it weren't for you, I'd still be doing street muggings. Remo, if you want to do a job, I'll work with you. Just say when. I'm through with robberies. Our feats hadn't been in the news for a while but they said the gang of house robbers had mysteriously disappeared. This worried me, I feared that'd be linked to my arrest. But who was I? Who were Maurizio, Bully Boy and the others? I, who for so long felt invincible only after a robbery? Maurizio, who only felt happy in a new car, with his confused memories, his lonely adolescence. Bully Boy, with his toughness, raised in a hovel amidst garbage, his headbutts and that shadow of his that perhaps derived from all of this. And Halfcent with his avarice, his fears, and the others, always involved in something dodgy to get by, with the threat of jail looming ahead. For the moment I was free, but my freedom was poisoned. I thought the bar would resolve things but I had a myriad of problems. Ten million lire worth of cheques had bounced, I had no funds and they were in the accountant's hands. I had a few hours to pay them. How can I? I've got nothing. I've got 12 million but it's tied up. - I'll make up for your lost interest. - I can't, I'm sorry. - I can't help you, I'm owed 50 million. - Why offer then? I didn't know I wouldn't have it, it's a bad moment for everyone. - What about the other money you have? - I can't touch it, believe me. I won't leave you in the shit, my dad'll help you. His father gave me 20 million but at 20% interest per month, 240 in a year, extortion. How can people dress like this for work? I look like a fool! We have a new uniform now. - I don't understand these things. - Because you're a bully boy. Stop calling me a bully boy, I'm not a bully boy, understood? Don't you dare call me a bully boy again! Do my tie again. Do my fucking tie again! Do his tie. My name's not Bully Boy, it's Marco. - You open up, we'll wait here. - Me? Yes, you. Is that a problem? No, it's not a problem. - What the fuck did you do? - Shit, she fought back. - Get in, quick! - She even scratched me! Let's go! - Pull over! - What the fuck's up? I'm going to throw up, pull over! I'll vomit in the car, Remo! Stop! His wife kicked him out then dumped him, she's fed up. He smoked like a trooper, he whined all bloody afternoon. That idiot made me smoke too. We'd changed uniform to look different but it was no use, we weren't what we used to be. To be honest, the rich weren't the same either. THERE'S A WAR IN ITALY - What's your profession? - I don't work. How do you get by? - Friends help me out. - Are you a prostitute? - Of course not! - What the fuck do you do then? - Give us the rest. - There's nothing else! You want us to leave empty-handed? A property developer lives in the flat below. He's got a flat on the third floor for his whores. Go to him, go to that bastard. He's got plenty of money and is friends with government officials. What did he do to you? He didn't do anything. He used me, he got what he wanted then he dumped me. Now he's with a young girl. Here, that's him. He's not handsome, but I liked, at first. We were together three years, but he didn't leave his wife. He left me for that young slut. I don't know, it's not the first time that has happened to me. I'm just no good at getting men to stay with me. After a while, they leave. The years go by and I'm not getting any younger, you know. Leave me 100,000 lire, if you can, or I won't get by. By now I was leaving houses feeling remorseful but the feeling that overwhelmed me was a sort of sense of failure. However much I robbed, my life wouldn't change and stealing was pointless. It was cold, but my tongue was sweating too not from the balaclava, it was the nervous sweat that accompanies you on the job and stays with you until it's over. Anxious thoughts flooded my mind, the threat of death, the vices and slyness of criminality, the hiding and being on the run. And all of us, scuttling around their houses like hungry mice. Did you find anything? That place is full of money, but how do we get in? That's simple, we'll wait then go up with them. It's too big to handle. - We don't know who's in there. - Bullshit, let's go. - Make them get everything out. - They've got nothing. This is all we found. You live with these two dopeheads? Where's your husband? We split up, because of this issue with drugs. But I can't give up, they're my children. Maybe it's best you take that stuff. - Who the fuck are you? - I've come to see my father. - Where does he live? - In the flat above. - Come with us first. - I need to see him, wait! Rome, February 1983 Come on. I'm a politician. Young men, you know what you do. We're all God's children. - Your Eminence. - We're in the hands of the Lord. Come with us, come on! Move it! Move and you're dead. They're my father's election posters. Do you realise what you're doing? You enter the houses of respectable people, take our money, the fruit of a life's work. Young men, take heed of our Lord's seventh commandment: thou shalt not steal. Bitch, where's all the rest? - There's nothing else. - Get the rest out! All of it! Answer that, if you alert them, I'll blow your head off. Hello? Hi. Yes, I'm fine. Do I sound strange? No, darling, everything's fine. Yes, I love you. You know that. Why do you ask? We're still having dinner. Of course I'll tell him, don't worry, I won't forget. All right. I know it means a lot to you. Listen, I'll tell him as soon as I get the chance, okay? Okay, I have to go now. bye. You're doing this because there are no jobs. We Catholics work in politics so that young men like you don't end up doing this. I'll help you find a job. Come with me, I'll give you a job. My husband has found jobs for plenty of poor people. He'll find one for you too. Yes, in a jail. He'll get you a steady job, something easy, where you clock in every day then just come back to get your wages. When he says he'll find you a job, he means it. I'll put a good word in for you too. Will you cut it out? Why do you want to find me a job? Forget about it. There's more here, but I don't know where. Stand up. Stand up. Stand up! - You didn't tell me about that money! - It belongs to the party. Tell me where it is. I collected it for the party. - I'm paying it in tomorrow. - Take it out. Open it. - How much is it? - I don't know, I'm the middle-man. I hadn't even opened it. My dad will be worried, I'm over two hours late. Get ready, we're going to your house. We've got enough here, take it down, leave this to me. You're on your way? Good, come and see. My wife and I are very worried. I told you, he's just disappeared. My son called two hours ago to say he was coming, he left and arrived at our house. Yes, the taxi company confirmed it. Remo, they're all tied up, we can go. Let's go. Face the wall. - Did you catch them? - Yes, it's the gang of house robbers. - You're sure? - Yes, it's them. It's those bastards who rob houses. - Bring them in. - Okay, we're coming. The war was over, they'd finally caught me. The rich had got their revenge, I knew they would one day. I'd upset too many people and I too was left scarred. A year earlier I wouldn't have listened to Bully Boy, I wouldn't have gone to that villa but back then I wanted to lose.
