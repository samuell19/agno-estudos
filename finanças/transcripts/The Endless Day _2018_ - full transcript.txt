You're It! -Tino's It! -You lost! Who's counting? You're It! It doesn't count. Tino's It! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! -You're It! You're It! -You're It! Ok, but... It was too easy to see you! 'Cause you count like this: "One, two, three, four, five" Only up to five, and you should count up to ten. I did count up to ten! No, I only heard up to five. She's counting. No, you are. -No, she is. -You are. You because you lost. You came in last. No, she came in last. -No! -No, she came in second. No, I was second! -I was-- -No, no, no, no! I'll show you how it was? No, no, no, no, no! Look, I came out like this, she turned, then I touched base, -and then she touched base. -But I was already here, I turned that way and then I got here. -Yeah, but-- -It's true, but she touched base first. No, I did. Ok, but you're counting. Ok, but next time you're counting. One, two, three... seven, eight, nine, ten. "Ready or not, here I come". -You're It! -No, you have to go to the tree! Candy party! Candy party! -Candy! -Yeay! Candy party! Candy! Candy! Come on, everyone! Yummy! Candy party! Candy! Here, Tino. Brush your teeth. "The stepmother led the children somewhere they'd never been before, in the deepest woods. Like the last time, they lit up a fire. 'Children, stay here' commanded the stepmother. 'If you get tired, you can sleep. Your father and I will go ahead. When we have enough firewood we will come back for you.' At lunchtime, Gretel shared her tiny piece of bread with Hansel who had spent his, signaling the path with crumbs. They fell asleep. The night fell. No one came back for them. When they woke up it was very dark. Hansel hugged and consoled his sister: 'Wait till the moon shines. We will then see the crumbs.'" Stay close to me 'cause in the woods there may be wolves. -Like in the story! -Yes, like in the story. Claa, you're too far, come here! Children, come here. I'm gonna try again. No, you get the ones on the ground. What's this? There's one up there. On that branch. We got enough anyway. Give me that. Here, take this. Ok, let's go. -When will we get there? -Soon. When will Mom and Dad be back? Soon. How much is "soon"? "Soon"...? "Soon" means... 12 hours and 90 minutes. And how much is 90 minutes? Soon. Come on. Wanna play big bang bong? -And then we freeze! -Yeah! Ready, steady, go! camalayo. camalayo Row, row, row your boat... Squirt water at the penguin...no, don't. Rinse well or your eye's gonna sting! Move over, Claa. Come here. Come to bed now, leave Coco alone. Coco, don't. Come on, Tino. Coco! Get back to your bed. Coco, go over there. Coco! You go over there, Coco. -Come on, Claa! -No! Come here! No! -Let go! -Come here, Claa! Claa! Not there, this way! -Come here, now: "Knock knock". -"Knock knock". "Who's there?" Don't, Tino! This is real acting. "Who's there?" "Sir, can I sleep here for the night?" "Yes, but just for one night." Now you say you are really hungry. Coco! Come on, let's... Look: if you stop saying "Coco" and you do as I say, I'll give you... a 100 candy at home. -Coco! -Ok, then I won't. Come on! -You want me to make you fall? -Olâ€š. Come on, Tino! When can I direct? Never! Lie down! Go on. Stop it! Tino! Stop it! Stop it! Five... -Four... -Stop it! Three... Stop it! -Two...! -Sit down and stop driving me crazy! One... Stop it! Ok, when Mom and Dad get back... Stop it! "Then a soft voice cried from the parlor, 'Nibble, nibble, gnaw; who is nibbling at my little house?' The children answered 'The wind, the wind, the heaven-born wind.' Suddenly, the door opened. Leaning on a crutch, a very old woman came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so frightened they dropped the candy. But the old woman said: 'Don't be afraid, dear children. Come in, make yourselves at home.' However, the friendly old lady was in fact a witch. She had built her house of candy only to lure children. Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far. But they have a keen scent like animals and are aware when human beings are near. This witch loves eating children. If she caught one, she'd cook him and eat him." -To eat them! -Look. -Poor Hansel and Gretel! -Yeah, they'll be eaten. And alive! "If she caught one, she'd cook him and eat him." She hides her hair. She is so mean. Look, she has red eyes! Look, here's the witch. Look how fat her hands are. Yeah, and they look like claws! "'Ha ha ha... I've got them, they won't get away.'" What does the story teach us? -Let's see. -Me, me! -Hold on. -Not to escape... Not to escape from home or listen to mean people. -Your go. -Never talk to strangers and... That's what I said! No, you said "never talk to people". And also... You shouldn't escape into the woods -and... -And never talk to strangers. Yeah. And if you find a house made out of candy, all the candy in the world, cakes, everything... You mustn't touch it. You have to leave in case there's something there that can eat you or harm you. There's not much. Well, bring something. No bread either. You want some stock? Bread is over there. -This is all there is. -There's the bread, bring it. -Don't mix it with the sauce. -Now bring me a bowl. Ok, but don't mix that with the sauce 'cause it'd be really horrible. Over here, Claa. Thanks. Get the plates. Should I give you the cheese grater for... Come on, I had it first... Ow! You hurt me! Plus I was-- Stop fighting! You too, Claa. Like this? Yes, very well. Careful, Claa. Eat properly. I'm drinking it like soup. No, no, no! -How then? -You eat like this with a spoon. There you go, very good. But the spoon doesn't get much ketchup. Claa! Pick it up. Your recipe is really good. Fan, your recipe is really good. It's yummy. No, Claa! Ok, now I've had it: out! Get out. Claa! Claa! Come inside right now! Coco! -No, Coco you can't come in. -Let him in! No! Let him in, let him in! No! No, Coco can't come in. Mom and Dad will get mad if he comes in dirty. -No, come here. -Let him in! "Cla..." Here, write this: "Cla... Claa! Where are you? ra" "Clara". Copy it with a different color. So you won't scribble over mine. Don't scribble or do circles. Claa! Why won't you copy it? Come on. So when we go to school, you'll be able to write your name. Claa! Where were you? -You better not have been in the woods. -No. Come here, it's your turn. I'm hungry. If you eat too much, the devil will cut your hands off. Guys! Where are you? Tino! Fan! Guys! Come on, come out! She's too far. She needs to think, rules are rules. Tino, come out! But she'll never find us. Then go get her yourself. No. Coco! I have to go, stay here. Can I come with you? No. -Where are you going? -Stay here, I'll be right back. What is it? Claa is outside. Let's sing songs! La la la, la li la li, li lu... da ba ba ba ba, pa pa. Shhh! Quiet! Let me listen. Shhh, Tino! Don't move, I'll be right back. move. Come here, Claa. No! Where are you going? No! No! Come on, come here. -You can't go there! -Stop it! No! Let go! It's forbidden. You'll get in trouble. No! What are you doing?! Let go of her! Stop it, what are you doing?! Leave her alone. Come here, Claa. What did I say about going up there? -Let's go. -No... Come on, Claa. No! Come on! Turn around. Stop it, Claa. No!!! No! No! No! -No!-- -Claa! What did you do to her? Stop it, Claa! Nothing, she wanted to open the door. You know that door is locked... No! No, no! -Stop it, Claa! -No! Stop it! -No!!! -Stop it! No... Ok. Get out of there, little goat, little goat, get out, away from there. We have to get the wolf to take the goat away, we have to get the wolf to take the goat away. The wolf doesn't want to take the goat away... ...to burn the stick. The fire doesn't want... It wasn't them... They'll be back soon. Get out of there, little goat, little goat, get out, away from there. We have to get the wolf to take the goat away, we have to get the wolf to take the goat away. The wolf doesn't want to take the goat away, the goat doesn't want to go away. Get out of there, little goat, little goat, get out, away from there. We have to get the stick to punch the wolf, we have to get the stick... "Night came on, and a terrible high wind arose making them dreadfully afraid. For the farther they went, the more lost and bewildered they became. They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up." POOL SWING PARENT'S ROOM: FORBIDDEN / DO NOT ENTER HOME / DO NOT GO OUT ON YOUR OWN ENTRANCE TRACTOR FORBIDDEN WOODS Don't touch! Stop it, Tino! I'm on it: I'm bigger than you. But I want to get on. But you can't until I get off. And when will that be? In one year and two months. -It belongs to Mom. -No, it's mine. -It's Mom's. -It's mine, Mom's not here. Leave it alone!

Remember to be good and always do what your big sister says. Stay close to her and never talk to strangers. You can write us letters if you want. We love you and miss you a lot. See you soon, love, Mom and Dad. PS: Never go into the woods alone because it can be dangerous." Can I read it? No... You don't know how to read. I'll show it to you when you can read. I'm tired. Well, this is how the game is played. Blue, blue, blue... Blue, blue, blue... We take the sponge, we plunge it like this... and if we want to, we can add this. What is it? I don't know but... it's white and it must clean well. Like this... Ow, you stained me. Well, sorry, this is how you do it... You have to both clean and get dirty at the same time. And then we get a sort of... cleaning milk. Come on! What are you doing? I'm twirling so... -But there's the cloth! -Ok... Like this, squirsh We have to leave it real clean. What for? So that when Mom and Dad get back... they won't find so much trash. Claa, come over here. Claa! Claa! What are you writing? Whatever, you can't even write... You're so stupid. Tino, climb and get that fruit. There is no fruit. Set the table, Claa. Want some more? I don't. "As soon as he felt better, he went back to his light existence, until one day someone tapped him on the shoulder and as he turned, he saw Death was standing behind him. 'Follow me. The hour of your departure from this world has come.' 'What?' replied the man. 'Are you breaking your word? Didn't you promise you'd send me your messengers before you came for me? I have not seen any of them.' 'Be still!' answered Death. 'Have I not sent you one messenger after another? Did not fever strike you and shake you, and throw you down? Has not dizziness numbed your head? Has not gout pinched your limbs? Did your ears not buzz? And furthermore, has not my own brother Sleep reminded you every night of me? As you slept, did you not lie there as if you were dead?' Not knowing how to answer, the man surrendered to his fate and went away with Death." Tino? Claa? Tino? Claa? Tino? Claa? Tino? Tino? Tino... Come on, wake up. I can't. Where are we going? Don't, Tino! They're not for eating! These are "magic beans"! Stop it! We're gonna play a game like in the story, see? Jack and the Beanstalk Dig holes.
