AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN 1940, FRANCE WAS CUT INTO TWO BY AN ARTIFICIAL BORDER APPOINTED: "LINE OF DEMARCATION" THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO THE INNUMERABLE FRENCH WHO FUNCTIONED AS "PASSERS" AT THE PRICE OF THEIR FREEDOM AND OFTEN OF THEIR LIFE. - Let's go! - Let's go! I am scared! Scared! Yes, I am scared! I would rather wait for the night. Are you crazy or what? So! Hurry up or what? If you want to stay, just say so! Drop your package. The monkey across from us is making signs. What does he want again? I don't know. Do you have a cigarette? No, but Morin, do you think I am here to entertain you? Thank you, Chef. - Good day! - Good day! Look over there! Why? Patrol! A French escaped, over there! Is he dead? Yes, dead! Over there! On the other side! Ok, let's go! At your service! Georges de BEAUREGARD presents In a Film by CLAUDE CHABROL THE LINE OF DEMARCATION Written by Colonel Remy Director of Photography Jean Rabier We thank the authorities of the Department of Jura, the firefighters, the bridges and roads department, the inhabitants of Dole, residents of Belmont Chissey, Fort Lesney and the Dole Defense and Police Dog Club. Pardon me, Countess. How are you Mr. Siméon? Could be better, you know! And what about your wife? I am coming, Countess! Well, your ham gave me a hard time! The German officer on the line wanted to take it. It looks gorgeous. Look at this! He wanted to give a hundred more! I took it upon myself Countess! Thank you on behalf of my friends! Allow me, Countess... You're welcome. I am surprised they have not arrived yet! Is it the Doctor? Doctor Lafaye? Yes, yes. We haven't seen him? No, not yet. Do you want some tea? It is coming from Switzerland! You have tea? One, two kilograms, is that all you want? We have coffee. Do you want some? Yes, of course. Coffee, tea, but how are you doing that? We have our ways! The Germans never open your luggage? Well, we give them a little something. They are like everybody else. I can assure you; They go hungry just like us! Here comes the doctor! So Countess, should I put that aside for you? And, with that, I am going to add some chocolate for you! Yes, yes sure, anything you can! Oh, Mary how are you? I am well, I have your ham, Jacques! You are all pink! I am well! There is also tea and coffee! Wonderful, come and see that! Do you still have gasoline? But darling, I am a surgeon at the hospital! I need to be mobile! Are the children ok? They are doing very well; They are in the Creuse at Jacques' Mother. Simeon! Come and help me to wrap the ham. And Pierre? How is he? Yes, he is still at the hospital radio in Vichy. But he is not going to spend his life there. He is walking now. Yes, yes. Paperwork was not ready yet. I am waiting. This dividing zone is insane, isn't it! Halt! Line of Demarcation. Yes? Let it go, Pierre! Florent will help you! I can deal with it by myself. Don't catch a cold! Don't worry! How are you Pradier? Very well, Count! Are you feeling healed? As you can see! Your papers are in order, Count? I hope so; I have been expecting them for six months. Yes, because those on the other side are rather finicky. Ha! The papers! It is because of the scribblers we lost the war Pradier! What are you going to do with your suitcase? I am going to phone Mary so that she can come pick me up in her car. It is not possible Count. Why? The phone is for the Germans! In that case, I am going to ask those strangers to warn the castle! But Count, the Castle is also the Kommandantur! What kind of story is that? Mary did not want to spread it. You were wounded! She was wrong. I am not going to cohabitate with those people or what? She had the hunting lodge set up. Goodbye, Uncle. Be careful! I am a handicapped defeated officer. Goodbye Charles. Give a kiss to Mary for me. Your papers, please. Well, your papers, please. I don't understand. You don't speak German? No, not in my country. Sir! Call me "My Captain!" You are not my captain. "My" is an abbreviation for Sir! I said Sir! Yes you did, but you did not say Mr. Captain! Mr. Captain! You say you speak German at your place? On this side of the barrier Mr. Captain, it is not your country anymore! But it is, in any case, not yet yours! You want to see my papers! Naturally, Mr. Captain. You will see them, but after a formality. You are in uniform, me too. Your rank is inferior to mine. Please rectify the posture. I don't understand. It means to salute me. What? You are going to understand. Attention! Damn it! So rude! I could go to higher places! Everything in order, Mr. Captain! I am pleased. But I need to inspect the suitcase. Very well. Over there! Have one of your men carry it. Me, I will stay outside. Hermann! Wait! International regulation require the search be done wearing gloves. I won't require you use white ones, but I want you to use gloves. Adjust your hat! Good posture! These are the rules! Well, the Count came back. Wow, he is limping. How come he is already back? Oh my Gosh! Pierre! Oh, Pierre! You came on foot? Only from the bridge down. Be reassured! How are you? Why didn't you call? The phone is for the exclusive use of the occupation army. And you, what are you doing here? Black market. What is that story? If it wasn't for Mary, we would be starving. I don't understand. Oh Pierre, everything is so difficult! The barber finds us cut meat and tea. - Bravo! - Well you know; We manage. - You see what I mean? - Yes, I do. Old pal, the reason of our defeat is this "we manage" business. Yet if we would reason like you, I would like you to note that the ham we are taking with us thanks to Mary and the barber would be in the stomachs of the Germans. And we are only temporarily defeated, no? Really? Listen. This is not going to last much longer. Doing great, Michel? I am ok! Now I can tell you where we are heading. About time. I was not supposed to tell the secret. You know what I think about England? I would be delighted to know! It is the country where you get to touch girls inappropriately and drink lukewarm beer, where you eat leg of lamb with mint sauce and cultivate secretiveness. You are wrong to despise mint sauce. Without mint sauce, maybe we would not have invented Intelligence Service! And why do you call it Intelligence? Because you think you are smart? No, but we try to understand. Must be time-consuming for you, no? We have endurance. So in your opinion, where are we going? If I told you that I don't care! You are not curious! It is a good trait. Me, what I want is... to kill some Germans. Well, I don't think you are going to shoot many. If I had known, I would have joined the commandos. Your task will be more immediately useful. Our only weapon is the transmitter. And this? I hope we don't have to use it because it would mean we have been localized. And that we cannot emit any more. Yup! You hate me. No, it is not that I detest you; I just don't like it. Sorry, but I am scared. I'm scared, too. We will probably be scared all along. You have to get used to fear and ignore it. Let's go. Coming. Hey, over here! Colette. Ah! It's you! I had an awful dream. You were in front of me and you were covered of blood. What are you imagining? What is it? Why did you keep your coat on? Don't worry about it! Why don't you ever say anything to me? It scares me. But what do you want me to tell you? Someone fetched me for a wounded man. What is it? Who is ringing? Don't worry that much. It is a patient; I must operate, that's it. Are you going to the hospital? No, I am not going to the hospital. Don't worry; That way I will be right back! Are you asleep? Yes. Kiss me. Come in! Joffrey says hello. Cigarettes? Get in there. So, when did you arrive? Last night. Ah, it was you, in the plane? The whole town heard you. The landing field was not far. You know, the Germans are on edge. I hope that soon they will be on edge for other reasons. Yes. Because if we succeed... Yes. If we succeed, the resistance in Germany will be organized, Doctor. And then, we will be able to parachute arms and material. But for the moment, what do you need exactly? A room in town, discrete. That is possible, you will have it right away. And then a quiet house to install the piano. The piano? The piano is the transmitter station. Ah, allow me... Ah, you have a transmitter station, then it will be fairly, fairly easy. A small forest house in the Chaux forest, would it be ok? Yes? It is perfect! But for the moment, where is your... where is your piano? In a suitcase, at the station luggage office. Good idea! You don't realize... Finally, well listen... never mind, I will manage. You just need to give me the station luggage ticket and I will make sure the hospital staff hides all that. You don't realize the Gestapo is in town. The town is small and easy to watch. So don't show yourself, because I am warning you, there are patrols everywhere; It is simple. Because of us? It is easy, you woke up the entire town. Ok, it doesn't matter for now. Tonight you will sleep upstairs. I am warning you; It is only the maid's room. I will switch your room later, ok? For the moment it is better if my wife doesn't know about it. You are absolutely right. Michel and I thank you. Hmm, and something else. Oh and, I am warning you; You won't be alone... a wounded soldier is also in the room. He got wounded during his escape and moreover he came by train. And since I am the SNCF physician. Come over here. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! So, any news? Still nothing! What are the patrols doing? They are looking for something. We want these parachutists before tomorrow! Who is this? It is the wife of the castle owner. She looks British. She is British. And she is not in a concentration camp? She became French by marriage. You'd better keep an eye on the pretty lady, Major. Where does she live? In the hunting lodge in the back of the park. With her husband? Of course. He is an officer. He was wounded during the France Campaign. The defeat of his country totally broke him morally. And he also still suffers of his wound. A French Junker? Home? A conservative! You must get along very well with him, Major von Pritsch. Dear Major von Pritsch. These two parachutists before tomorrow. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Just before you returned, a poor escaping prisoner who tried to cross the Loue river swimming was killed by the patrol. His body landed by the Graviers. The German customs officer told it to Pradier on the other side of the bridge: "Go see over there, we just killed one." He looked all happy. It is indeed very sad. He was trying to go to the free zone. He is there now... dead, but there. Why are you looking at me? Because I don't recognize you. Did I change so much? Yes, a lot! Really, I don't feel it that way. Well, beside some physical details. Remember. The day of mobilization. Yes, but a few things happened meanwhile! France lost the war for example. The war is not over. Too bad. What do you mean? I am saying that it is too bad the war is not over. I beg your pardon? Come on Mary, its outcome doesn't make any doubt. The longer the war, and the more poor people will suffer. You don't believe in victory? What victory? Our victory! The Germans did not succeed to invade England... as they were sure they would. But it will happen. And allow me to tell you it will be justice. You have no idea what it is to fight in a sky deserted by allied aviation. But Pierre, if the RAF had not called back their plane, England would be occupied as we speak. England would today be an occupied country. So what, France is occupied! But if England was occupied, there would not be any hope. Don't you understand I don't have any hope? I respect your faith, but I can't share it. I was able to measure the amplitude of German firepower. Believe me, it would crush any thought of resistance. I don't believe you. You listen too much to London radio, my dear. It may cause you problems one day. It will only feed your illusions. And I hate illusions. Please accept my apologies. Let us try to make sure that at least between us there is peace. Pierre... If we were older... and if we had a son of the age to fight... would you refuse he go to England to join General de Gaulle? Yes. I would do everything in my power to make sure he doesn't go. Is it you who is talking like that? Yes, it is me. Would you refuse to do something against the Germans if you could? Do something? What, for example? Cut the phone lines? They will be repaired in the next hour. You know as well as I do what happened to this poor guy who wanted to play that game. For a 50 meter phone line that was repaired right away, he was brought to the firing squad. It's murder. Go ask his widow who remained behind with seven kids what her opinion is about doing something against the enemy. No, let's be reasonable. This little war cannot cause any serious harm to the Germans, it gives them an excuse to be more rigid. I am saying that those who inspire that resistance are criminal! Good evening. I apologize, Countess. I was taking a stroll near the lodge, and I saw that one of the curtains of your window was not pulled back properly. Sometimes my men are a bit too zealous when they see the lights are on. I wanted to avoid you the unpleasantness. You are too kind, Major! I apologize for not getting up, but my leg is not willing. Please come in, come in. Please sit down. I don't want to disturb you, Count. Not at all. Mary, please would you fetch the bottle of old brandy? Sit down, please sit down. Thank you. How are you recovering from your wound, Count? Which, Commandant? Beside my leg, I had about twelve shrapnel wounds in my body. Yes, war is a horrible thing. Your affairs are not looking so bad. Count, from the time we had to give up the landing in Great Britain, I understood... the war would last. Please help yourself. Thank you. When we attacked Russia, I knew it was lost. But the red army suffered serious defeats. Yes but winter stopped us before Moscow. Yet that is not bad to go until Moscow. Napoleon did not do any better. Napoleon... Napoleon died in St. Helena. Come on, it is not the Berezina! You are very pessimistic, Commandant. I am not sure what to understand. Tell me? You seem to wish the victory of Germany. But no, you are pushing it too far. I am just trying to be objective. Marshal Pétain himself is showing us the way, isn't he? Very old and very good. What are you talking about, Commandant? About the brandy or about Marshal Pétain? I would not allow myself that liberty, Count. Marshal Pétain, I think... that he... he knows very well, how should I say? Let us not go into details... Count von Damville. No, no, no. "De Damville." Sorry, Count de Damville. Did you see today the automobile stationed in front of your castle, a black Citroën? Yes I saw it. It brought two men of this special police we call Gestapo. I am sorry to say that, but they are very hard on people. I think you already know... London speaking. Pay attention to your lights, Countess. In fact, pay attention to everything. Strange character. You should be happy; He was adding grist to your mill. Count! Urbain? Come on, come on in. What do you want? I am sorry Count, I saw you had a visitor, so I waited. What is the matter? The matter is, Count, I have three men at home. Men, what men? Two Englishmen. What are you talking about? Well, Count, exactly one American, one British and one Belgian. They are all coming from Brussels. What is their story? I am not sure Count. I found them tonight when I came home. They almost got caught by the Krauts. The patrol came two minutes after. Are the British and the American pilots? Yes, Countess. Well it is what the Belgian says anyway, because the others, you know to understand what they say? Are they in Uniform? No Countess. They wear civilian suits, the three of them. Maybe they are imposters? Germans? No, Count. The Germans, they have a special smell. Well, make sure those people go immediately. Well, it is what I intend to do, Count. It is what I intend to do; At the wood edge, I will pass them on the other side of the river. The Patrols never go there. It is out of question. You will show these three fellows the door and ask them to go elsewhere. But, Pierre, you are not going to give these people away to the Germans. Not at all, they shall leave quietly. It is all I am asking them. But you know very well that if Urbain does not guide them, they are lost! Think about it for two minutes. The castle is occupied; Our presence here, in this lodge, is barely tolerated. Remember what the Major said. Did you understand that his visit was a warning? It does not matter! I am responsible for the staff. There are posters placarded on all the walls of the village about the slaughtered aviators. If Urbain gets caught, he is liable to forced labor in perpetuity. It's a shame! It's a possibility! The Germans are defending themselves. Imagine his fate. What would his wife and daughter think of us? You are right. I'm going to go there. What are you saying? Wait for me Urbain, I'll get my coat. Mary! I am begging you! You forget that there are 3 men in danger and that one of them is a compatriot of mine. You know very well that it is forbidden to be in the park at night. What will you say if you cross a patrol? Come on, Urbain. Excuse me, Countess. Good evening, Jane! Good evening, Countess! Well, Marguerite, say good evening to the Countess. You are the Belgian! Yes, yes. I was told that you came from Brussels with these two men? Correct. Both are aviators? Aviators, yes. And where do you plan to go? Spain. This is the American? There you are, yes. I will give you the address of a friend in Biarritz. Okay. He knows all the smugglers of the mountain. Marguerite, give something for the Countess to write with. I will give you directions. Well, I'm going to tell Georges for the boat and I'm picking you up after right away. Here, first you go to Poligny. But do not talk to anyone there, because the Germans have a lot of spies. In Poligny, you take the train to Lons-le-Saunier. I think it's a direct connection for Lyon by Bourg. Then the best route to take is Tarascon, Mimes. And in Toulouse, I know there is a direct train to Bayonne. In Bayonne you will take the tram to Biarritz. And there you go. You will remember? Yes! Poligny, Lons-le-Saunier, Bourg, Lyon, Tarascon, Nimes, Toulouse, Bayonne, Biarritz. Here is the address of the person to contact. You will learn it by heart and immediately after you will burn it. This gentleman is an old royalist. Before going to see him, you will buy a white carnation. You will give it to him by saying: "It comes from Mary's garden." That's all. Here's the money. You do not have any choice. The road is long for Gibraltar. "The road is long for Gibraltar." George! I need you! I'm coming. I have three men to pass right away. What's the matter? I must take the rowboat. It's impossible, they doubled the patrols! We have no choice! Go ahead, pay attention, the next will pass in twenty minutes, I'll do anything to hold them back. - I'll be waiting for you there! - Okay. Turn off the light! I don't understand! No light! Why, no light? Why, no light? It's forbidden! Forbidden! Yes, good! Let us drink some schnapps. Sit down, sit down gentlemen. Very cold outside? - Yes... yes, cold. - Schnapps, good? Cheers! Prost! - Come on, hurry up. - I'm doing my best! You don't get it! Verdun! - Yes... - Not good there, huh! There were idiots like you, you know. A lot, a lot. And many more guns, tanks, high shell holes like that, a lot of misfortune. So! Dad. You there, dad. - Yes... Dad. - Daddy over there, yes. Kaput, no? Many kaput, many dead. To my health! Bunch of idiots! Prost! Good luck. Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Tricot, I salute you as the representative of secular and compulsory education. Good morning to everyone. Father, how are you? It's okay! So what's up? Well, it's not too bad! Ah, thanks. And you, Chéti? I think it's not so good. But they say you make money with passages. Hey, we've got to eat. Say, do you think it's a job for you to live on the pain of people? Well, I have a wife and kids! We must feed them. If you think it's easy, you, at this moment, if you do not get a little money! And then, I have risks anyway. Have you, then, Chéty, you think that those you pass they do not have kids too? Yes but... yes but the children, I make them pay half price. Yet it is the most dangerous, you never know when they will start to cry. You are honest and brave. Oh yes, and worse, I never ask them. It's always them who propose me. Yes, you take their money, to please them, what? Don't say that Mr. Tricot, I'm going to cut you off. Good day. Hello, in a hurry? Please. Four. Four! It's alright! Good Lord, they really have nothing to do. One wonders why they occupy us. Thank you very much. So the Channel, you have not it pumped yet? The English Channel? Ah, the English Channel. England's not kaput. The war is not over! War is big misfortune. Oh, not for everybody. Done, next of these gentlemen. And Moscow, huh? Is it the same, neither seen nor caught? Oh, no. The beard and the hair. Mr. Siméon, I have to go, I'm waiting. I have miscalculated my time. Take the priest in my place and I'll come back later. Who goes hunting loses his turn. Especially if it's for the pooch. Ladies, excuse me. I see you have arrived. It's been over an hour we have been waiting! Excuse me, I'm yours right away. Are you okay? He cannot stand still. That's the friend who brought you from Dôle, he's always on time. So when are we going? That's precisely why I'm late. I was doing a little tracking. In Besançon I was told there was no danger. There is no danger, but you have to beware of the times when they change the patrol time. Will there be a lot to walk? No, a little stroll. Do not worry! And the river, how are we going to pass it? By boat! I'm not going to swim you anyway. And the suitcases? I have a friend who has a border permit who will pass them tomorrow in his car. It's annoying, because we put everything we could save in it when we left. Ah well, it is ok if you want to get caught with your suitcases! But I am not one of them! But I can pack my briefcase! The briefcase if you want. But... for suitcases, I'll have to ask you for little extra... because I will have to grease the customs officers, and then the guys who pass them. I must pay them. How much? 5,000 francs for suitcases. 5,000 francs but you've already taken 5,000 francs per person. It's 20,000 francs, so with the suitcases it's 25,000 francs. But I do not pay for the baby! And then say, you know the risks that I have if I get caught? Besançon prison, you do not know, you, but I went there for six weeks. Why? You were arrested. Yes, a crazy story. They released me. 25,000 is very expensive. Leave it! We must pass. Perfect. Ah, you must leave me the keys of the suitcases. But how, you told me that the suitcases would not be opened. Yes, but we never know if the customs officer will ask, just to see. Give the keys, Claude. Well, gentlemen, Ladies, you just have to wait here, until tonight, very quietly. Why? Can we not pass now? And get shot? A boat on the river in broad daylight, you see, dear lady. Well, then, my wife has prepared a little snack. All this is planned. There is even milk for the baby. Come on ladies, tonight! And do not worry! Everything will be alright! They bring them to the castle. It seems that after they send them to camps, even the small ones. So Chéti, are you finished? What do you want? Are you using the casual "you" now? What do you want from me? Trash. No, tell me! The Jews. The Jews? What did you do with them, you piece of trash? The patrol! No, bastard. You left them in the woods, and you stole the little old guy's suitcase. It's not true! Shut up! After that you ran, they were picked up. All four, with the baby. But it's not true! If you repeat once again that it's not true, I'll crush your mouth! Is it understood? The path you followed last night, I did it again. I followed you on the trail, like a rabbit! You junk! Well, tell me. You're ready to bury your booty, huh? What are you going to do to me? What am I going to do to you? What am I going to do to you, bitch? Did not you understand why I let you dig your hole? Help! Save your breath! Do not worry about shouting. If it's the patrol you're calling, it will not pass for two hours. I will have time to fill the hole. Listen Mr. Urbain, I have a wife and 4 kids! We could not make ends meet, that's why. And the kid of the woman that the Germans took away? You did not look at that one, huh! Listen, I'll give you everything I have, I have money. I have 25,000 francs and suitcases! There is jewelry in the old suitcase. For whom do you take me, bastard? You bastard. Not possible. Our Father who are in Heaven, deliver us from evil. On the front of Libya the fierce attacks of the Africakorps broke against the unwavering resistance of the Tobruk defenders. Bravo, Tobruk is not taken. This little war in the desert does not mean much. You would not say the same thing if the Italians had entered Cairo. Come on, do not get angry. Understand me. For a year now, it's just a series of advances and setbacks for water points. Cairo, on the other hand, is a real goal; Who owns it masters the Suez Canal. On the other side they are only sands. The English are going to get bogged down. That's what we're going to see. You listen too much to London radio. That's my right. Well yes and no! This right the Germans refuse you. Yesterday the veterinarian of Salins was arrested by a patrol. He was listening to the English radio. You're welcome. It's so little. And here are some personal messages: "The little horse is very sick." I repeat: "the little horse is very sick". "Frédéric thanks his friend Gaston" I repeat: "Frédéric thanks his friend Gaston!" "The red pencil..." These are puerile games. Looks like they're having fun. Do you realize that you are listening to nonsense that you cannot even... I repeat: "the red pencil is seen from afar." "It will be hot on the banks of the Channel". I repeat: "it will be hot on the banks of the Channel". "The road is long for Gibraltar: I repeat: "the road is long for Gibraltar". "Getting it right rather than getting there first". I repeat... What is it, Mary? I cannot steer the boat anymore. Finally, what to do? But, jump, quickly, I'll try to hold the boat:. I cannot hold it back! Help! And here it is! Very good. Pack everything! Why? Are we leaving? Yes. We're leaving! We're good here though, right? It's not a warm climate, but midday rabbit stew was something, or not? This is not a reason enough to stay! We are too isolated! The more isolated we are, the easier it is to locate us. But the Kraut are far too stupid! Do not underestimate the opponent too much. And here they are! Here it is! Here it is! Open immediately! Go ahead! Do not worry about me. Go to Dole in the small room. But you will never manage with these 2 suitcases! Get out of there yourself! I am an old fox. You have everything of a young chicken. Go! Stop, hands up! Major, the interpreter is here! Let him in. Well, Monsieur Loiseau? Hello Mr. Major. Hello. Mr. Loiseau, do you know why I called you? No, Mr. Major. Really, you do not know? Sit please. Decidedly, Mr. Loiseau, you do not know anything. Excuse me, Mr. Major? You know nothing about it, you do not see anything, and you hear nothing. I do not understand, Mr. Major. And then you do not understand anything! Those four Jews who were arrested the other day, did you not know them? No, Mr. Major. You did not see them arriving in the village with their big suitcases? No, no, Mr. Major. Louis Meunier, aka Cheti has disappeared. You did not know that either? You are not surprised; Of this disappearance? Major, this man was a kind of poacher, you know... A poacher, yes. You are too respectable to attend the poachers. And to prisoners of war who escape stalags of Germany and who are trying to go into free zone, you did not know that either? We stopped two last night, the other two drowned with their guide trying to cross the river. That you did not know? I was told but, but... I did not know their presence. Mr. Loiseau, why do you never know anything? Major, people are suspicious of me. And why, good God, since you never know anything! Well, because I'm the Interpreter of the Kommandantur. Exactly! You're paid by the Wehrmacht just to be an interpreter and I do not need much interpretation! Mr. Loiseau, I suspect you to be an accomplice of these people! If so, I will arrest you. But, Major, you know that... Open your eyes and ears. It's your interest. You know that there is a clandestine post in the Chaux forest that our surveillance services spotted yesterday. Hello? Major von Pritsch. What? So. Perfect. Thank you. Very good. Mr. Loiseau, there is no more transmitter station. The man was shot in the forest, but he is not dead. We will make him talk. You can leave. Try to help us. Are you waiting for something? No, I just wanted to assure you, Mr. Major that you can count on my loyalty. Thank you. Get out, now. Shitty business. Wait here! Sir? Doctor, I came to take news of the wounded man. It's a bit early. We need to quickly interview this man. There is no question. In any case he is under the effect of anesthesia. And when is he going to wake up? Well... in two or three hours, I think. But at that moment, I will forbid you to... make him speak. You, will you forbid? Yes sir. By what right? Simply because I am a doctor and responsible for the life of this man. This man is a spy. He had an envelope which proves it. All this is not my competence. When will I be able to interview him? Sorry? When will I be able to interview him? I do not know! This man is a criminal. Really. If you'll allow me, for me, it is a wounded person in danger of death. If the wounded was German, you would see things differently, no? Oh, suffering does not have a nationality, Sir. Well, now I'm going to ask you to leave, please. I want to see this man for a moment! No, Sir. I won't allow you to. I do not need your permission, sir. Of course, you can use force. But you can kill him, you know. And at that moment, it's not me who will be responsible. No, believe me, wait a little longer before you interrogate him. Goodbye, Sir. No, Sir! Identification! In order. So? Well, listen. He still had three bullets in his body, but I think he'll be fine. Tell me, the Germans found an envelope on him, do you think it's a problem? I do not think so. It's encrypted messages, the code will hold. But for Michel? It is necessary to avoid at all costs that they interrogate him. If he speaks, all the networks are screwed. Ah, but I will not be able to stop them for long. I know, yes. We should try. Quickly! Quickly! Is the surgeon who operated on the injured person there? I'll see, sir. It's insane! That's right: I'll complain to the Feldkommandantur! As you wish, sir! The order is to immediately take the wounded! You are only brutes! God will punish you! Out! Ah, was it you? We'll meet again, Michel. But how did you do it? We will explain to you. And now, how are you? Do not bother yourself. The doctor defended. It's finished. Soon, you will eat leg of lamb with mint sauce. Oh: It's not for what you believe... So, why? When I think you have shaved your mustache because of me. Shit! The Germans! Flee to the woods! I want the man alive! What time is it? 11:45. 11:45 already. You're not lying yet, how are you doing? I washed the dishes. What did you bring me? I thought you would need it. What is that? Did you expect someone? Nobody. Good. I'll leave them at the door. Good evening madam. German police. Ah, Doctor! Still at work at this hour? Schumann? Weber? Yes. Forgive this nocturnal visit, Doctor. We are anxious to hear from you. What? I do not really understand. The one you let go this morning. Ah, but sorry, but I received a formal order. I tried to oppose, myself, but... Do not give yourself any harm. Your husband is a comedian, madam. I do not understand. I'm sure that's fine. One of your accomplices has been arrested. He is very talkative. But who are you? I do not understand. What you are saying? Oh, forgive me. We have indeed introduced ourselves to her, but not to you. We are the German police. Our name is not important, we are the police. Geheimestaatspolizei. The Gestapo. Forgive me, but I still don't understand. But I told you that one of your accomplices was arrested and that he is very talkative. Jacques, what is it? I do not know. You will know, Madam, because you will come with us. But why? My wife is not aware of anything. Yes, the French always hide everything from their wives. It's well known. We have only a few questions to ask. But, do it here, because we have two children and no maids, so... Doctor, that's not true! Your children are at their grandparents' house and you have a maid. But finally, ask my wife, right now, you'll see she's innocent At home, Sir... it's more comfortable. We are installed, equipped. You will not touch her. We are not savages! We take him, simply for her to tell you to talk... because you understand well that we will be obliged... to use towards you... processes. Bastard! I advise you, avoid as much as possible the use of big words. This can irritate us. What do you want to know? We want to know where the wounded spy was transferred. That's all. If I tell you, you will not take my wife? It will not be necessary anymore, Doctor. Well... I will show you on the map. Your husband was really a good comedian, madam. And now you will do your luggage. We have to take you with us. The man was taken from the Dole Hospital yesterday morning at a quarter to nine. We went after him. We took this road, the D.7. They naturally sunk in the forest. We warned the Feld-gendarmerie. And we found them there: La Belle Nanette. How many victims here? The grenade thrown on the first truck killed eight men. Eight dead? Yes, luckily a cretin from us also launched a grenade who shredded the terrorist we wanted to catch alive. They burned the truck that contained their German uniforms. How could they have these uniforms? We are doing an investigation. It is not the first time. For a little bacon, butter or chocolate some would sell their flag. How did they take their wounded out of the forest? Another car. You think the spy has been transported across the line of demarcation? No, Major Von Pritsch. We gave the alert immediately. I can tell you that the line of demarcation is now insurmountable. The man is somewhere around there. And the surgeon's wife? She did not know anything. She did not support the bathtub well. The injured man is surely hidden somewhere in this area between the village of La Loye and that of Chissey. There are only small villages. None exceeds five hundred inhabitants. Exactly. The injured person is caught in a trap. We cannot visit all houses at the same time. We would need several thousand men. And the Wehrmacht, Herr Major is never in a hurry to provide them. We only have one solution to make people go by. Can we call the interpreter, please? Mr. Loiseau, come in, please. Do you want to sit down? Mr. Loiseau, you are an insurance agent in Montbarrey, is that not correct? Yes, sir. And you know everyone in the area? Yes, sir. Mr. Loiseau we want to find the wounded spy who had just been operated on yesterday at Dole Hospital. We think he's hiding in a house that cannot be very far from here. Do you have an information about this house, Mr. Loiseau? No, sir. Not really. Do you like Germans, Mr. Loiseau? Ah yes yes! You know everyone in the region, you have said it just now. Are you with us or not? - Oh yes, yes, sir. - Well, Mr. Loiseau, you must know in which house the wounded spy is hidden! It's hard to say exactly. Because? Because? Because... everyone is against us. You understand? Sure Mr. Loiseau, we do not need to pay an interpreter for the knowledge. But, dear Mr. Loiseau people talk to each other, just listen to them. The French are so talkative. Well, yes, but in the village people are suspicious of me. I am the interpreter of your Kommandantur. Well, Mr. Loiseau, you have to hear what people do say to each other. You are paid by the Wehrmacht, Mr. Loiseau. You have 24 hours. I give you 24 hours to bring me the information we need. It's understood? Yes, yes, sir. And leave Mr. Loiseau. Do not waste time. I will wait for you here tomorrow at the same time. Schweinerei! What do you mean? French crap! They are not all like that. Yes, Major Von Pritsch, but those who are not like that are our enemies. It's their right! Mr. Tricot! Do you want to confess? No, no, Monsieur le Cure! I need to talk to you. So I cannot hear you here! Please, there are Germans in the church. Go for it! Have you heard of the wounded man who was taken out of Dole's hospital? Yes. And the suicide of Dr. Lafaye. You condemn it? But no, of course. So, this wounded man from Dole's? He's at my place. You must help me! We have a sheet that explains how to treat it. But my daughter cannot do everything. She is too young; She is not used to it... Does the Countess of Damville appear to be a nurse? You want me to talk to her? - Yes, of course. - Thank you, Father. There's nothing for it and I'm very happy because I was not very sure of your patriotic feelings. Well, I thought the same thing about you. You only speak to me to throw the cry of the raven. Gambetta did not like priests and Clémenceau either! Good! Tell your daughter to pretend to be sick to justify the visits of the Countess. It's not stupid. Good. When you leave the confessional, go on your knees and pretend to pray. Oh, Father. Okay. Go for it. I give you absolution. Father, I come for confession. Madame Rousseau, I cannot now. Come back tomorrow, it must not be in a hurry. Hello Mr. Menetru. Close the door. It is true that it is chilly. - It's the season. - Yes, but it's not hot. And to warm up. Did you see the price of the wood? But you can pay for it. Oh, you know the insurance, it's not going well. Yes, yes, there is not only that. Oh, don't talk about it. They are suspicious of me. Well, do you have a little something to warm me up? Not today, sorry. How do you think we're going to get rid of alcoholism in France? Don't care. Don't care. Good, well give me a little coffee. Without the brandy on the side, ha-ha. National. That's all I have. I assure you it's a hell of a drink. What do you want? At war and at the same time? You have saccharin, because I have more. Do not worry, Mr. Menetru. I do use sugar in my coffee. I had planned for the occupation. Tell me, Mr. Menetru what do you say about this story of the forest of Chaux? It seems that the Germans have ten dead. It's ten bucks less. Oh yes, but that does not help our business with the Germans. They are furious. They only had to stay at home. We did not go looking for them. Yes, but in the meantime they are there and they are the strongest. If they retaliate... What do you want them to do to me? That they take away my other leg? I do not care I'll be dead. They have other means. I tell you that if we do not find the wounded by tomorrow everyone will drink. For it to be good, it is necessary to put five times the volume of water. - Well, say so, I thought it was a day without... - So what? And that pernod was forbidden? It does not phase me. I will take good with you instead of the Café National. No, no, the pernod is made to drink with friends. So say, you do not have a small idea? An idea of what? Well, the patrols have tripled for three days. And what do you want me to do? I do not need to go to the free zone. No. But, the injured. Those by the river do not talk about it, and by the woods in the state where it is - do not talk about it either - And so? So! It is hidden somewhere! That's why you came to ask me for coffee, dirty bastard! Hey, Mr. Menetru. You are a spy, you are disgusting! You're leaving home, huh? Monsieur Menetru, I am like all the world! Like everyone! Does that mean I'm like you? No, but repeat a little to see! If they put a fine on the village, huh? I will pay my share. Yes. And if they arrested hostages? I will do like the others. That's all! But what are you doing? I do not want you to drink my coffee, even if it's bad. Come on, get out of here! You want to laugh, Menetru. Get out of here, or I'll break my cane on your mouth! It will cost you dearly, Mr. Menetru. - Take my leave, by the name of God! - It will cost you dear, Mr. Menetru. It will cost you, bastard! Asshole! Disgusting person. There. All finished for today. I will come tomorrow. Genevieve, did you understand what to do? Yes, madam. Remember that for everyone you have angina. Do not put the tip of the nose out. I will not move, madam. Your father does not change his habits? No, no, ma'am. It's okay? Are you English, Madame? My accent. Do you have news of my captain? Which captain? Captain Duncan-Presgrave, it was he who made me escape. He has shaved his mustache; I would never have thought of him. You have news? No I do not know. Rest. To find out, you can ask Dole, the surgeon at the hospital. I know him. He's a great guy. Besides, both are great guys. I'll take care of it. Sleep. Here! Here! Hello, Mr. Simeon! Can I get a haircut? Do you make infidelities to my colleague from Monbarrey? No, I was going through the... I saw that there was nobody, so... Yes, I was eating. You want the newspaper? No, no. For what's inside. I wonder if this war will last for a long time. Well... we cannot do much about it. What do you say about this story in the forest? It's a blow to us attracting boredom! The Germans are furious. I am well placed to know it. Well, put yourself in their place, too! I wonder where they took the wounded guy, for example. Anyway, he must still be on this side, because, since yesterday, he no longer passes the line, so... But tell me, there was not much to cut. You want me to pass you the lawnmower? Yes, yes, go ahead. You do not have an idea, do you? About what? Where he is. Who is that? Well, well, the wounded man. We have to get him somewhere. All I know is that he is not at home. You will see, if it continues, the Germans will pick up hostages. That could be, yes. The only chance we have is that we find the injured! After all, we do not care about it. If he wants to do spy-swimming, well he just has to cross the line somewhere else. Maybe that's right. Glasses. Yes. If it was not a coward, well, he would arrange to tell the Germans where he is just to avoid retaliation of others. Because... because we must not forget that there are five or six municipalities in the coup, huh? Well, here. It's five francs. Well, what is that? Well, it's Mother Fouillard who died. 97 years old! She will not have seen her century, poor thing! Is there anyone sick at the school? Ah yes, yes, his daughter. She has angina. That's why I saw the countess come out with a kit. Ah, it must be for that, yes! Five and five, ten. Thank you. But the priest, he's not sick? Ah, maybe I do not know. It's because I saw the Countess go home afterwards. Well, she goes there often. She likes the priest. She is always ready to render service to her pro-chain, the Countess. He is a good person. Oh yes... he's a good person. Yes. And not proud. - Well, goodbye, sir. - Well, that's it, come on, goodbye. - Thérèse! - Let me finish eating. - Come, I tell you! - Why? Come here, I have to tell you something. Ah, that is annoying, you've become really crap! No it's not that. You'll go to the teacher right away. I regret, Monsieur le Cure, the Ausweis are superseded for the moment. I know, Mr. Commandant, but a dead person... But why does she want to be buried on the other side of the line? All his family is buried in the cemetery of Mont-sous-Vaudrey. She was a widow. Her husband is there, we must not separate what God has united. If permission is granted, how will the body be transported to the other side? Ah, but we have our hearse. Well, Monsieur le Cure, I will reflect. Oh, Commander, make a quick decision. Fast! Why? But because I celebrate the funeral service tomorrow morning and the burial must take place afterwards. I want to see the dead woman. Come in! Major, the interpreter would like to see you. Make him wait! I am busy! So? Major said to wait! But it's very urgent. He said wait. You need to wait. If we give the license, here are the conditions: Nobody will be able to go with the hearse. But the horse? But to drive the horse, you have to guide him! Yes, but he will be searched. Who is it? The gamekeeper of Monsieur le Comte. It's your friend. And I beg the favor to accompany the deceased to her last home. You will be searched too. If we give permission. Sir, I will be in good company. Let's go see the dead. Come, Herr Major. Mr. Major! Just now... Yes, but it's press... I said: It's all on time! So? You found the wounded spy, Mr. Loiseau? Well no, sir, but... Well, Mr. Loiseau, stay. We'll come back in a moment. So? It's going? That's it, it's over. Ah, it's complicated to do! Teas to cart in the yard? Yes, she is here. You do not know, huh. Well, I'll take him right away. Better be careful. You know, Urbain is dangerous. The coffin is still a little big and then... a little high. Mother Fouillard she had all shriveled. Do not worry, she stretched out during death. So tell me, the holes are not visible? Don't worry about that. I wish it were tomorrow night. Me too. So, Mr. Commandant? It's good, Pastor! We accept! We are human, Pastor! Thank you gentlemen. God will take it into account. I hope. Mr. Major! I told you to wait, Mr. Loiseau. Can I ride with you in the car, I think I know where the wounded is! Dad. Hello, Mr. Institute. Sir! We will not let you down for a long time. You have no doubt realized that we are representing the German police. We came to perform a small search in your house. A search? Why? I see that your daughter's angina is over. Yes, it was a false alarm. But I still do not understand... It's simple though. We think that the wounded spy is hidden in your home. Here, a wounded spy? Is the Countess of Damville the one who took care of your daughter? She is a good nurse. She may have treated the injured at the same time. Finally, we will visit. Do not cry, Genevieve. These gentlemen are not mean. It depends, sir! Dear, Mr. Institute! I would like you to give me a ladder. A ladder, why do that? I would like to open this hatch. It's an attic. Nobody ever goes there. I love attics. They are often full of interesting things. I beg you, go get the scale that allows you to see it. I'm fine, but you're going to get dirty. Fine. So? There was no one, sir. Please go out and stay at our disposal. But that is to say, I would have to go home. I do not know if that will be possible. You're a bit burned, do you understand? I find you a little incriminating. Do it yourself. Please take him. Right here. We're both out of luck, Herr Major. I'll ask you to stop this English woman. But why? She is a little suspicious. She is no longer English since her marriage. She seems to interest you a lot, Herr Major? She's a pretty woman. I do not want you to talk to me that way. My relations with the Count and Countess de Damville have always been correct. It's justice: We'll stop this lady. We will put her in Vittel, in an internment camp for the English. Very good, very good hotel. Not heated, of course, but it's war. Obersturmführer, we will be in trouble. She has the right to complain to Brussels, to the Militärbefehlshaber. So what? General Folkenhausen is likely to strike us on the fingers. Don't make me laugh! We will stop him on a denouncement. But what kind of denunciation, please? I do not know. We will say that she listened to London radio. It's normal, it's an English girl! But it will make a very bad impression. I do not care. Good impression, this time is past, Herr Major! This is madness. It is impossible for the Germans to suspect anything. We have no choice, Count! I do not understand that you, a churchman, let yourself embark on such an adventure. You will run to disaster and for everyone. You will forgive me for mixing your gamekeeper, but, I repeat, we do not have the choice. Do you realize if the wounded man had been discovered at Tricot... he would have been shot, his daughter with him? We had to expect reprisals. When I said that he did not help these people, their fight is not ours. We are in an impasse. I beg you, stop this radio! I know we are almost out of luck. But it's the only one. - We have nothing else to do. - It's possible, I'm sorry, stop this radio! It's useless, Countess! English radio is very interesting. What does this gentlemen mean? Explain, Herr Major; You are very well acquainted with the Count and the Countess. Count, these messengers of the police have asked me to transfer the Countess to Vittel to an internment camp for the English. It's a very good hotel, Madam. - It's inconceivable. - You also listen to English radio, Monsieur le Curé? You were right Pierre, you should not listen to the B.B.C. You will not pretend that, for such foolishness This is not foolishness, Monsieur le Comte. Do not forget blankets, Madam. Do you have enough money? Yes. When will I see you again? Don't worry. Don't make a show for these people. Madam, you must leave. Coming. - Count I would like... - No, please. Ah, they will go out. - The bastard Loiseau is not there. - Oh, it's disgusting. Pastor, do you want to come in? Band of bastards. Who said "bastards"? - It's me! - Your name? Menetru, Eugene, class 13. How? It means that in 1913 I was 20 years old and that I lost my leg in Verdun. Do you know that, Verdun? A great German defeat. Bloody old pig! Yes, not stupid, you look good. Oh the funniest thing is that this bird comes to drink the drop every night at my bistro. He can still have a small glass of schnapps. To you, my dear Urbain. I will make an admission, Monsieur le Cure. I almost expressed my thanks to the two individuals who came to my home. The very ones you just left, for the rest. I believe that, without their knowledge, they have done a great service to my wife. Father. Another prayer before you leave. When you see my wife again, tell her, please, that I love her. But, Monsieur le Comte... Hurry up, Monsieur le Cure. These gentlemen are waiting. Father, what are you waiting for? I'm going there, sir. Come on. Open this coffin! Open this coffin! And what about him? What? The aristos and I never got along well together. What? I am a socialist. Understand? Tisch, yes, tisch, tisch, so can you please. A socialist, you understand? Human rights and Citizen. The guy on the floor is still a human being and a Frenchman, no? No, not "Franzose." French! You cannot talk like everyone else, eh, stupid? You're not going to leave him on the ground, to die like a dog. It's justice! It's justice? No, but sometimes. International, then, what are you doing with it? What, do you not know? "It's the final struggle, let's get together and tomorrow... International... " Come on, children from the homeland The day of glory has come Against us, from tyranny, The bloody banner is lifted bloody banner is raised Do you hear, in the countryside
