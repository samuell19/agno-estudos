My Life has been a series of bad decisions Because of this I found myself in a strange bar in a strange country waiting for the man who turned my heart to dogshit. - May I have a glass of red wine, please? - We only have Chianti. - What kind? - Chianti. - Okay. - This place is a dump, a real shit hole. Yeah. So what's your story? - What? - What's your story, are you visiting? - I just moved back to America for a bit, thank you. - Well, cheers to you. - Cheers. - Yes. Cheers to not being scared, I ain't scared. I know what to do in case of a nuclear attack. Trick is, get away from the densely populated areas, get your ass out to the woods, like upstate, you know, they got trees, real trees, not this little twig. Nick was punishing me. Making me meet him somewhere where the wine is corked. Before I met up with him I decided to visit places where we used to go together. Am I a masochist. Of course I am. But the places we used to go aren't the same. The people have grown younger while we have grown older. Nick would always talk about how he felt we were like gorillas. From the same... What the hell do gorillas travel in? It doesnt' matter anymore. He called me his little cat. How silly relationships are. Nick was the exact opposite of the kind of guy I thought I would fall for as a girl. But he was so broken I wanted to lick the pain right off his face. My mind drifted again to my father. I will never forget when he-- - Oxygen, you know, and they clean the air, that way you can breathe better, and think, yeah, 'cause it's gonna get crazy, I tell you. Shit, you know, buildings going down in flames and shit, mm-mm. I got me a tent, I don't even need a domicile, I got me a tent, I just lay out in the grass, pop my tent, boop, I'm good. - I don't understand, you talk so fast. - Well, better to talk fast than not at all. You're not into that, huh, talking? Yeah. You got the face for quietness, you ain't gotta say a word. - Okay, Barry. Move. * I'll wait forever * Even though it's the end of the world * - Hey, beer and a shot? - Hi. - Hi. * Even though it's the end of the * * World - I wanted to talk to you. I wrote a play. It's about us. And I would like you to read it. - Okay, all right. - Look, it's honest. - It's confessional. - Is there a difference? - Yeah, honesty's hard. - Okay. The lead actress, she wants to meet you, she thinks it would help her to discover her character, and I think it will help her, too. Obviously it would be a tremendous favor to me. Maybe you owe me a favor. Look. I know how things are between us, but you know how much it means to me. I've been writing the play my entire life. - You gonna take your shoes off, or what? - There's no time for naked feet. - Come on, make yourself comfortable. - Listen, it's. It's about my father, too, it's about, it's about what happened when I went back to France. You throw it away before that part. - All right, all right, show me a picture. - Of who? - Of the actress. - You want to see if she's pretty? - You jealous? - She's pretty. - All right, I'll make you a deal. I'll meet her if you have sex with me one last time. - Oh, that's a good joke. - I'm serious, come on. - I know you're serious. - I'm just trying to help you out, I want to see if she's a good actor or not, you know, can she act like you, can she fuck like you? - And you made yourself sick, your breath smells like death. - You miss your gorilla, though. - No. - You don't miss your gorilla? - I don't miss my gorilla. Don't do the gorilla. - I told you no shoes. - You will come to see the play, won't you? You will come to see it? - Take off your shoes. Nick taught me to be impulsive. We would throw parties, then escape to have sex outside. I would imagine he was a stranger, which got me so wet. But I knew I was safe because it was him. My big gorilla. Now he is really a stranger. - It's honest. - It's confessional. - Is there a difference? - You take the most, I'm sorry, can we do it again? Ugh, the grad thing's weird. The next day in rehearsal, I could barely hold myself together. The grad thing, I'm just trying to figure out how to make it feel, it feels kind of corny, but. - It's honest. - It's confessional. - Is there a difference? - You take the most intimate details from our lives, you twist it around to where I'm the bad guy, and then you don't even do me the basic courtesy of telling me about it, is there a difference? Sorry, what are we doing? Hey. - I'm sorry. - You all right? - Yeah. Some men make you cry, others let you cry on them. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you for helping me through today. The director is supposed to treat the actors like babies, not the other way around. - Oh, don't feel bad about it, the material's hard, you know, it's your life. - Yeah, my life, I have some imagination, don't I? - I have to tell you, I think that what you're doing with this play, it's really-- - Boring. - No. - Predictable. - No. - Self-indulgent, exploitative, cruel? - No, brave, I could never put my life on the line like that, I mean, nothing has ever really happened in my life, anyway. - I can only cum during sex if I know I'm gonna get my heart broken. - Do you have a room? - It's too far. Is this a bad idea? Ow, fuck. - I just want, like, when you see a baby, you want to bite him. - Oh. Usually, when I actually love a girl, I have a hard time, you know, lasting, I did my best to make sure I didn't embarrass myself with Mona. I thought of my roommate clipping his toenails, but it didn't matter, the sex was just too intense for her, she fell asleep. I wanted to keep fucking for sure, I hadn't come from a woman in months, but just watching her sleep, that was enough. Usually when I watch girls sleep in my bed, they just look like aliens, it's weird to sleep next to an alien, but Mona, she felt like a human, she felt like my kind of human. - Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Feel free to ponder this age old question as you let the eggs fry in the pan. It's important to give yourself a break, just watch the eggs. Don't need to think about it, it's a beautiful sight, isn't it, just enjoy it, don't think. - I heard a corny joke the other day. - I need a coffee. - Coffee. Did you sleep all right? - I had a dream I was a black widow spider. - Mm-hmm? - They kill their mates, you know? - That's neat. Fuck, ah! I had met Mona at a party at her ex-boyfriend's house after one of her plays, it was a really personal play, and I told her that I liked it. Looking at her was like looking at a sunset, it gave me a boner. - On the Uber ride here, we passed this liquor store, Raul's Liquor, and I just thought to myself, like, who is Raul, you know, like what is his story, what is his day like, you know, a liquor store would be a great setting for. - Totally. - Raul doesn't want you tell his story, Raul just wants you to buy his beer. What did you like about my play? - I thought it was self-deprecating without being self-indulgent. - You get a gold star. - Whoa, that's too much food to eat. - I had to make breakfast for myself, anyway. Are the eggs okay? - Oh, I don't like eggs. - Oh. - Sorry. - It was honestly one of the best mornings of my life. The only problem was when I went inside, my pee really hurt. - Unfortunately, you've tested positive for gonorrhea, we do have an antibiotic for you to take, the next step is for you to notify any sexual partners you've had in the last 60 days. - Well, you didn't get it from me, I get checked constantly. - I'm not accusing you, I'm just telling you what I have to tell you, the fact that you get checked constantly is a little-- - I'm not gonna let you shame me. You know, underneath this mister-nice-guy act is a real passive aggressive asshole, I see through it. - I don't care what Hannah says, I'm a good guy, deep down, when it counts, in a life or death situation, like when a ship's sinking, I help the women and children first. It was clear Mona was developing real feelings for me, so I needed to give her the news the right way, I planned on making my puppy dog face when I told her. - Oh, hey, you're the guy from the show, right, the Clown Academy? - Yeah. - Why aren't you doing that anymore? - They killed my character. Yep, the puppy dog face, my secret weapon, my ace in the hole. - Hey, can I have a cigarette? - Sorry, this is my last one, man. - Please, just one cigarette? - Sorry. - Oh, please? - To the outside world, it looks spontaneous, but only I know it's totally calculated, I control my every tick, why don't I get more work? Fuck, I gotta learn my lines. At another time in my life, I probably would have gotten with Thérèse just to do it, but now I'm a one woman guy, and I don't want to lead her on. Yeah, good guy. - Are you uncomfortable with me? - No, no, I'm just having a weird day, I was at the doctor-- - Nothing serious, I hope. - No, it was just the flu. - Mm. Few. - No, the flu. - No, no, no, I mean the few, like, a few. You know? - Oh, yeah, that's good. - Should we try the kiss? - Yeah. All right, let's do the whole thing. - Yeah. - I guess I would expect nothing less from you. - It's honest. - It's confessional. - Is there a difference? - Yeah, honesty's hard. - Hi. - Hey. - Okay, so you must be Thérèse, right? - You must be Nick. - You look nice. Well, shall we? - Yeah, okay. See you tomorrow. - Bye. - You walk so fast, you'd think you're from New York. I knew I had to tell her about the gonorrhea at some point, it was looming over me all day. Hey, I never told you that joke, it's kind of corny, but it goes-- - I'm writing. - What's that? - I'm writing, in my head, I'm writing in my head. Sometimes when I walk, I'm writing in my head, it's nothing personal, it's just, you know. - Yeah, say no more, do your thing. I'd tell her when we got inside, that way I could do my puppy dog face. I knew I had to tell her before we had sex, though. Okay, I would tell her after we had sex. You're so beautiful. - Don't say that. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing, you little pussy. - That was it, I lose all control when girls talk to me like I'm dirt, I tried to think fast. You're seriously kicking me out right now? - Yeah, I'm feeling very confused, I have to wake up early tomorrow morning. - Can you understand why I might be feeling suicidal right now? - Yeah, okay, I feel that way all the time, you go on living, or you don't. I can't stand here all night going in circles with you. - I know, but I feel like we just have to address this thing between us. - What, but the only thing between us is this door. I told her, you can't spend the night here. - I have to tell you something. - What? What on earth are you doing with that face? - Huh? Hey, Kelly, how's it going? - Not bad, not bad. - Is Hannah working tonight? - Later, you want me to tell her you stopped by? - No, I'll just hang out, can I get a Jameson on the rocks when you get a chance? - You got it. - How's it going? And it's, like, very hard to be attracted to somebody that's attracted to you, it's like your tastes seem to be very shitty, and that's, you know, taste matters. - Man, what do you do for work, for a living? - Nothing, worse than nothing, I'm an actor. - Hey, Hannah's not coming in, she said something about an audition. - Yeah, of course. Can I have one more? - Coming up. - What do you do for work? - Sanitation. - Cheers. I knew I shouldn't call her, I'm a good guy, really, deep down, when it counts, when the ship is sinking, women and children first, women and children-- - Howdy, stranger. - Hi. - Did I say that right? - Yeah, it was perfect, thanks for coming. - Mm-hmm. - Cheers. - Yeah. You shouldn't drink when you have the flu. - What the fuck are you talking about? Kelly, have one more, and what do you want? - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Did you finish? - No. I'm a good guy. When it counts. Hello. Mommy, guess what? Another Crush? Don't be so condescending! This one is serious. How serious? Let's just put it this way: I made him breakfast this morning. You cooked for him? Yes! You will never see him again. What? Oh. - Time to start the day. - Great. - Handsome. I hope you don't mind, I watched you sleep for a few hours. - That's fine. - What? - You watched me sleep for a few hours? - You snore like a grizzly. - Fuck. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I just need, like-- - Advil? - Yeah. - Water? Bread. - Bread? - Eat up so. when we were having. - Sex. - Yes! Do you remember what you said? - Hmm? - Do you remember what you said? - Thérèse, I don't really remember anything about last night. It was black out, do you understand black out, black out? - Yeah, black out. - Yeah, yeah, I don't want this. Black out. - Silly grizzly. Come on, let's take a shower. - I'm fine, thank you though. - Oh, no fun. - Yeah. - Come on, let's get clean. - No, I can't, I'm a shower every other day guy, today's an off day, I can't break the rotation, I have sensitive skin. - Sensitive to what? - To water. - Oh. If you want to join me, there's plenty of room. Are they horrible? - No, no. Not horrible. - Yeah. I was raised with chefs in the house, so I never really learned how to cook. But I'm trying. - I think I'm gonna leave, I'm not really feeling very well. Thanks for breakfast, though. - Wait. - Look, I know that we should probably talk about what-- - I was just going to ask for a kiss. - Oh. For Your Information, mother, he loved the breakfast I made him. - Five, six, seven, eight. She told me not to tell any of the other students but she said I'm top of the class. Hey, Thérèse, I don't know what you're doing here, but you just gotta get out of your head, okay, and just feel it. - Yeah. - One, two, three, and four, one, two, three, and four, five, and six. It's not about the dancing, though, I've made so many great friends in class. Three and four, five and six, seven and eight, now go to your left, two, three, four. Mommy, I love daddy, but why couldn't you have had me with a black man? I'm not having this conversation again. Tell me about your friends. They're so wonderful. Liz is so sweet and caring. She's a good listener, and she makes sure everything is fair. - Everyone should get a little piece. - Great, a half of a half of a piece of cheese. And Joyce is so strong and sassy, just like the ones on TV. - So T. - What? - Any new developments on the Chris front? - Not really. - Oh. - I think he likes Mona, and I think she likes him back. And yesterday, he had a big bite that I think came from her. - So what, swoop in there, no way that bitch is cuter than you. - This bitch may not be cuter than me, but she's a more beautiful bitch than I, inside and out. - She's probably confusing her feelings for Chris with her feelings for her ex-boyfriend. - Maybe. - You know what you should do? - What? - You should wait for this whole crazy-ass play to be over, then Mona's gonna see she doesn't have any real feelings for Chris, unless he's playing her ex-boyfriend. Then, when she dumps his ass, he's gonna be all, "Oh, woe is me," then who's gonna be there, waiting on the rebound? - You. - So you're, you're saying I should go on a date with Mona's ex-boyfriend to make her jealous? - That's literally not even close to what I just said. - Then Chris will be all mine for the rebound. - But see, you've got it all wrong. So I decided to go ahead with Joyce's plan. I called Mona for an emergency meeting. I told her I wanted to meet her ex so I could better understand my character. At first, she was resistant to the idea, but I eventually convinced her. She even thanked me for caring so much about the project. Introduce me or I quit. Thérèse, remember in grade school when you called the girlfriends of boys you liked and told them they were dead? Yes, I was so young and silly. - Hey, Ms. Independence, you look good today. - Thank you. No one liked you after that, remember? Remember how much you cried when the whole school shunned you? How you slept in my bed for a year after? Mother, Stop using the past against me! I just don't want you to get hurt again. You don't get hurt like other people, you come undone, baby. You become dangerous to yourself. Oh, mommy! You worry too much. Chris has such a beautiful beard. It's clean, perfectly trimmed -- Like the pubic hair of a respectable woman. Oh, cookie. Don't make an old woman puke. And his hands -- They are strong, capable, but not paw-like like daddy's. And he has the most beautiful eyes you've ever seen. So much mystery behind them. You want to jump into them naked and drown. Baby, remember your co-star in that dreadful rendition of Three Sisters? You said the same thing about his eyes. And your co-star in that deodorant commercial? You said the same thing about his eyes. Even that boy who played Romeo to your Juliet in 6th grade-- Oh, mother! Would you stop living in the past? Should we try the kiss? - Yeah. Chris is different. When we kissed, it was like a million fireworks went off inside me all at once. With the other boys, it was just like...toy sparklers. That night, I was rehearsing my lines -- What about your date with Mona's ex-boyfriend? Did you actually go through with it? Huh? - You must be Nick. I just want to understand the relationship from your point of view so I can tell the story more truthfully. It's your story, too. - Who gives a shit? - I give a shit. Bite me, bite me. - Hmm? - Would you, would you bite me? I like to be bitten. Yeah. Yes. Ow! - What? - Not that hard. - I'm sorry. - Did you leave a mark? - I mean, yeah. Maybe. Hey. - Okay. You dirty old man. - What? Oh, yes. It was relatively painless. Anyway, that night I was rehearsing my lines when out of the blue Mona Skyped me. Hello? Mona Thérèse, can you hear me? Yes. I hear you. - Cool. How do you make the box that shows my face disappear? I don't know. I only want to see you. Your beautiful. You really are. Are you okay? I may have just driven a man to suicide. Oh, I'm sorry. And I ate some pot brownies. Have you ever smoked pot? How often do you get drunk? Almost never I'm a square, I guess. How was your date with Nick? I don't care, don't tell me. I just wanted to see your face. Your beautiful face... Touch my finger. Anyway, I'm actually glad you made me see my ex the other night I wrote a new scene based on the experience. Oh, fantastic! It might suck because I'm stoned. Do you think you can have it memorized by tomorrow? Yes, but it depends on how many pages it is-- Great. - You drink to have had happiness, you know why, because, okay, you dreamed to have had happiness, you know why, because in order to be happy, one must first be brave, one must first be brave. You drink to avoid happiness, you know why, because in order to be happy, one must first be brave, yeah, you could let go of your misery if you-- Hello? - Hey. - Howdy, stranger. - Hey. - Did I say that right? - Yeah, no, that was perfect. Thanks for coming. - Mm-hmm. - Cheers. - Yeah. You shouldn't drink when you have the flu. - What the fuck are you talking about? Can I get one more, and what do you want? - I'll just have a pinot grigio. - You got it. - Thank you. So? Have you read the new lines? - The new lines? - Mm-hmm. - We open in a week. - Yeah, Mona had yet another burst of inspiration. - Fucking bitch, you know, some people, if you're not as fucked up as they are, then they're just, you're uninteresting to them, you know, you're worse than that, you're disposable. - Did she give you that bite? - If you're decent, you're disposable. - I have a bite, too. You drink to avoid happiness, you know why? Because in order to be happy, one must first be brave. You could let go of your misery if you wanted to, but you won't. - I love you. He said he loves me, Mommy! Well I'm glad you met someone. Just try not to get carried away this time. I won't always be here to pick up the pieces. Oh, mommy, don't say that! You'll be around for a good long while. Thérèse, sweetie, you must accept the reality of the situation. Chemo only prolongs the inevitable-- La, La, La! Okay mommy, I should go rehearse. I'll send you some photos of Chris sleeping. You should have heard him snore. My big grizzly. Okay. I cant' wait to see him. Love you, baby. Love You! - The day after Nick's 10th wedding anniversary, he found himself day drinking in the park. He was taking pictures of old people, thinking about how he himself would soon be old, forgotten, unable to remember the things he once wanted to do, as he contemplated his own demise, two girls with perfect skin appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, one was Chilean, and exuded a youthful confidence that Nick could only understand as arrogance. "She probably fucks rock stars, and eats organic candy, "and practices some bastardized form of meditation "that requires no work," these were the thoughts that raced through Nick's head as he took her picture with the intention of jerking off to it later. Her friend, though, had sad eyes, she wore a dumb hat, and her name was Mona. They went to a bar, the Chilean took off because she couldn't keep up with him. Mona talked excessively about her own life, she was a good storyteller, she had a dark sense of humor, of someone who's lived, and boy, could she drink. Nick began spending a dangerous amount of time with Mona. They would sit on the same park bench for hours on end, taking pictures of crazy people. Mona was the first woman that seemed to genuinely like Nick since his wife, but his wife had long since realized the charms she saw in Nick as a younger person were entirely imagined. She no longer supported his photography, or choice in facial hair, Mona, Nick thought, understood him for the sweaty, misunderstood genius beast he was, mostly, though, she was just so beautiful. - I'm still going through changes you've been through yourself, you know? You'll always be 10 steps ahead of me. - See, what you just said, that was amazing, I could have never formulated a thought like that at your age. So you're mature for your age, I'm immature for mine. - Come on, that's every guy who's dating a younger girl will say that, it's so cliche. - Well, then I'm a cliche. - Yeah, you're a cliche. - I don't mind being a cliche if that means being with you. - I don't think you should leave your wife. - Hey, Gorilla. - Hey. - Oh, you're hanging your pictures like I told you to. - Uh-oh, oh, it's dripping, oh, shit. Oh, it's gonna drip on you, oh, no, I didn't mean to do that, I just held my ice cream over your face. - Why we took this, it's, is just, I don't like vanilla, I prefer chocolate. - Van-iy-a? - Van-i-ya. - Did I say van-i-ya? - No. - Did you say what? - What the fuck is van-iy-a? - I want to put vanilla on your nose. - No, stop. - I don't want it anymore, can I give it to you? - Stop. - Uh-oh. - Stop. - You just didn't, once you push like, once you see it's not-- - I didn't say anything. - Oh, I know, he's. - Should I try to go and get him? - No, he gets really angry. You okay, dude? - Are you okay? - What? - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry. - Nick could feel Mona growing disinterested by the complications of his very adult life, so he tried to integrate himself into her world. * My times will turn to guns * If I find Brad had sex * If I find Brad had sex * If I find Brad had sex - What? - Yes, what do you mean? Why are you making me sound like the fucking idiot? - You're crazy about this, it's-- - Oh, I'm crazy about this? - I never said that. - I'm Chris, by the way. I never got to tell you how much I loved that play. - How long is this shithead is gonna be, I'm gonna piss my pants. - You're not wearing any pants. - What? - You're not wearing any pants. - No, just these beautiful tights, it would be so sad if I got piss all over them. I really need to go back home, I need to take care of him. - How long will you be gone? - My mom's just completely abandoned him, there's no one. He's my father, and he's drinking himself to death now. - Please leave a message after the beep. - Hey, Mona, yeah, it's me. I know you're going through a lot, but, I mean, can you at least call me back? I mean, I haven't talked to you in, like, over a month. Hold on, that's you, disregard this message. Hey. Mona? Mona. I swear to god, if this is a butt dial, I'm gonna fucking lose it, Mona! Fuck! - Nick knew Mona couldn't abandon her father, but he couldn't go a moment without imagining her being fucked by some dirty Frenchman. - And, you know. - Yeah, you have a lot of moles, you know, but why not? - That's about all I know. - You know. - Bonjour! - Sorry, let's go home. - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Let's go outside, get some air. - Bonjour! Get some air, let's get some air. - When she returned from France, Nick vowed to end it, no matter what, his dignity depended on it. - Your stuff's packed up over there. What? - My father died. - And just like that, it was as though the past six months had never even happened. it seemed like Nick might be living out his own version of a happy ending. Then Mona casually mentioned she had an affair in France. She claimed it was born out of emotional distress, and the whole ordeal just made her realize how much she needed him. He wanted to forgive her, he tried to forgive her, but every time he closed his eyes. - Nick. - What'd you say? - What? - It sounded like you just said Nico. - What? - You just said Nico. - I said Nick. - One morning, Nick woke up to find a note from Mona, she hadn't dotted her Is with hearts like she usually did. The note read, "To my big gorilla, "it was nice to share a dream with you, "but now I am awake, I wish there was some way "of doing this to hurt you less. "I wish I didn't care about you, but I do. "I begged you not to make me your home. "What do you have to go back to now?" - Hey, Henry. Henry! Henry. Hey. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm here to pick up Henry, where is he? - No, no, keep your voice down, you were supposed to be here hours ago, and you're drunk. You're drunk. - I don't care, he's my fucking son, where-- - Go inside, listen, Nick, come on, let's make this nice, come on. - All right, I'm very peaceful, I'm just going up to get my son. - I don't-- - I'm just going up to get my son. - Let's not make it uncomfortable, all right? Stay composed, composure. - All right, you make a very good point, Jerry, all right, you win, I'll see you later, this is inappropriate, I'm sorry. - Now, get up, get up, get up. - You fucking hurt me, I'll fucking. - Nick, Nick, please, Nick, please. - Wait, no. - Close the door, close the door, close the door. - Come on, come on, I'll fuck my way through you to get to my son. - Hey, thanks for setting me up with that crazy bitch the other night. Look, I just wanted to let you know I'm not gonna come tonight, I guess I'm supposed to wish you luck or something. I hope this play helps you get over whatever you need to get over. Wear some lipstick tonight, oh, and I might have given you gonorrhea. - Howdy. - Hey. - Pre-show jitters? Maybe I can help you to get rid of them. - I just have to do some breathing exercises, so. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You're shaking. - I can't do this. - What do you mean? - I mean, I'm not an actor. - Of course you are. - No, no. Some guys overheard me imitating my parents at a mall when I was 16, put me in a Saturday morning kid's show, and I'm just bullshitting ever since then, but I haven't been on stage since I was in the sixth grade. - I'm sure you were great. - I was a tree. - I'm sure you were a great tree. - I just feel like if I blow this, then I will, I'm not gonna be able to come back, you know? - Aw, silly grizzly. You're good, okay? It's your lack of energy that makes you exciting, and you have me to guide you. - Mm-hmm. - What more could you ask for? - Just finish quick. - What, what was that? - What was what? Hey. - Of course. Your big night, your big premier, everything you wrecked our lives for, everything you wrecked your own life for has come to fruition, and how are you handling it? Like a little baby, in way over her head, like always? You should just stay down. I'd cry too if I were you, whole self image wrapped up in this grand notion you have of yourself as a writer, and yet you're incapable of writing about anything except yourself, now, is that writing, or is that just publicly crying? The world is going to shit, not in some far off, abstract way, but in real ways that affect the lives of people you know, and yet you refuse to look outward because you're so goddamned interesting. - I thought you loved me. - You're like a drug, you're like a drug that re-enters my life-- - I thought, I thought, I thought you, you loved me. - You're like a drug that re-enters my life. You're like a drug that re-enters my life after I've gone through all the-- - Can you forget the line-- - You're like-- - Can you be real, do you have a real in you, do you? - You're like a drug that-- - You said you loved me. - You're like a drug that re-enters my life after-- - You said you loved me. - I. You're like a drug-- - Why did you say that? Why did you say you loved me? - Because I fucking meant it. I always have. Fuck this guy, come on, kitty, you can do this, all right? Come on, you got this, let's do the material justice. - I can't, I'm covered in snot, and I don't have a tissue, okay? - Here, use this. Hey. Come on. The show must go on. - I thought you hated this play. - It's honest. - It's confessional. - What's the difference? - Honesty is hard, I never really got the hang of it. - Hey, neither did I. - When you left your wife without telling me-- - I felt obligated to at least give us a shot. But I know, you weren't really ready to settle down. - Our entire relationship, I never really needed you, that's probably what attracted you to me, and when I finally did need you, you weren't there. - When I think about what happened when you went back to France, what your father did to you, I get so mad, I don't know what to do. - The only way I knew how to deal with it was to turn my mind off, and follow my body. It led me to other bad places, it led me to other men, sometimes it felt, it felt good. Sometimes it, it didn't, but, in the end, it was the coping mechanism, and nothing more. I tried to make you understand. But you, you wouldn't listen. - When we talked about it, it made it real, and I had to push it down, that's why I started drinking like crazy, it made it easier for me to twist things so that, you know, I saw you as the bad guy. It was easier for me to see you as the bad guy, instead of the victim that you were, but we don't have to be defined by what we did. All this time alone, I've realized that waking up without you is like not waking up at all, I'm old, I'm tired, but I promise you, all I want to do is take care of you, be there for you. Please, Mona, what do you say? How about a happy ending? My Life has been a series of bad decisions Perhaps I thought I could make my life story worth telling, I could make it a life worth living as well. I say his name a hundred times a day.
