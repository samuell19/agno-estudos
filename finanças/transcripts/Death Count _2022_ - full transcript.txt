Stop. What is... Stop. What is this? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Wait a second, Coach Roberts, Principal Bruno, Selena, Kim, Mr. Curtis, Jose. Stop. Ladies and gentlemen, by this time you've been fed and I'm sure you're curious why you've been brought here and by whom. Allow me to introduce myself, I am the Warden and I have gathered you all here to participate in a little game called, And then there were. The number will depend entirely on you, I will only say that your survival is dependent on what you are willing to sacrifice. As with most things in life, there are rules, rules to the game and like most games the rules are simply not in your favor. An audience will be watching you. Our society has shifted into one built on cyber likes and it will be incumbent on each of you to acquire as many as possible to be liked. What you must ask yourself is are you willing to do whatever must be done to acquire the most amount of likes no matter what the cost in order to survive, in order to live? And since we wanna include our friends in the cyber world in our little adventure, they will vote as to which of you will begin the first round in our maiden voyage. At this time there are three basic directives you must follow. You cannot make any attempt to contact the outside world or you will be eliminated. You will follow and adhere to the schedule I set for you which includes non-refusal of participation. The person with the least likes at the end of the selected time period will be eliminated. The goal is to survive the game. Should you fail to comply at any time you will be immediately eliminated. Ah, it appears Number Six has issues with the game. Is this where I'm supposed to beg for my life, you fucking coward? Hm? What is it? You afraid to come in here and deal with me? Is that why you got to hide behind that camera in that fucking wall, cunt? Number Six, for someone who cleans for a living you have a rather dirty mouth. Can you just come in for a second let me clean the fuck out of your mouth, then I'll use my entire fist, I'll just fuck. There you go. Here, dog. - Ah. You like it, dog? Are you stating that you will not participate? You speak fucking English? I'm not doing nothing. Zero, kiss my ass. Such language. A caveat to the aforementioned directives. Each of you has an explosive device implanted at the base of your skull. Should you not participate the device will be executed and you will be instantly eliminated. Ooh, I'm so scared. Please don't blow me, ooh. Ooh, yes sir help me. Will you fuck me in the ass, please? Number Six, once again, are you refusing to participate? Is there something you wanna say to me, Huh? Is there something you needed to say? No, I will not participate. I will not participate. - Help me! - Oh my God. Oh no. Oh no. Number Eight, I strongly suggest you stop tampering with your device. I can figure this out. I can... I can find a way out. I just... I know what this is. It's like one of those... It's like on of those escape rooms, right? You just need to... You just need to find the hidden clue. Secret numbers to- Eight. To release these bounds. The only mathematics that can save you this time would be the amount of likes you'll receive. Like? What do you mean likes? What kind of likes like? I don't have any friends, nobody likes me. Like this, it's just a matter of time. I can figure this out myself. I'll do this myself. I've almost got it. Ooh. You're going to get it all right. Almost. So, there we have it. Remove the collar and the device automatically ejects itself in fairly nasty fashion. So two down, six to go. Well, six already went but you know what I mean. The real game will begin momentarily, stay tuned. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. What's this about a website? Is this some kind of a joke? People in cells? What do you mean people in cells? No, this is not being downloaded from here. We don't do things like that to our prisoners, I don't care what you see on TV. People, what the hell's going on in here? Did a bomb go off or something? Yeah, something like that, Captain. I'm getting reports that some guys head just exploded on the internet. Oh my God, the internet, it's always the internet. Every time I go online my head wants to explode. This is supposed to be somebody's real head and somebody else got shot through the eye. Now this is supposed to be a live feed. Being run by someone who's calling himself, the Warden. Exactly. It's some game or something. People are actually watching this garbage. This has got to be a prank, doesn't it, Casey? What are those numbers? Likes. We've got sickos out there liking this shit? Oh, you would understand that, wouldn't you Conner? That's what you do all day. Well, we're not the ones calling the station, detective. Well, why don't you calm everyone's nerves and tell them that you're not on the case, you're not on it officially, all right? What a Dick. That's what I'm paid to do. Casey, Tanner in my office now. Okay, okay. Gonna finish that banana? Here. Go on. Good luck. I want you two guys on this right away. Captain, I think the whole thing is a hoax. Yeah, I don't know. The site's encrypted, which means it's gonna be really hard to trace. This Warden guy is pretty smart. I mean, he's got this out where everybody can see it but he really does not wanna be located. What makes him so different from anybody else we're chasing around? I mean what the fuck, it doesn't make him special. I hear what you're saying, I do. We have to get this guy and we have to shut down this site. You know what would be good? Is if we did it today. I'm just getting too old for this shit. I honestly... What am I doing here? It's connected to the missing person case you guys have been working on. Phillips and Mitchell got a positive ID from this site. We got to do something. So you're saying that she's involved like voluntarily, she wants to be part it? Okay, this is gonna be hard, I know I'm your boss but you guys are the detectives. So why don't you go out there and get it done. The Warden. Let's go get The Warden. Okay, all right Captain. All right, get out. Come on, let's get this guy. Hello? Selena, is that you? Who's there? It's Rachel. Come over to the vent, the one across from you. Rachel? Rachel, I thought that was you on the monitor. Are you alone in there too? Yes. Do you know how we got here? No, I don't. Are you all right? You hurt? I'm okay. I'm chained. Yeah, me too. I think we all are. What the hell is going on, huh? I'm just an English teacher. I didn't do anything to deserve this. Neither did I or the janitor. Please. The game is about to begin. Please place yourself directly before your monitor. We better do as we're told. We'll talk later. You have 10 seconds or you will be eliminated. Fuck you. We'll just see about that. You have five seconds to comply. What the fuck? It amazes me how people can't follow simple rules nowadays. Once again, failure to comply means immediate elimination. Being a gym teacher, Number Seven, I assumed you remember warm up, stretch before exercising. Now let's see how limber you really are. You bastard. Oh. That poor woman, bless her soul. And with that we bid fair adieu to one lucky Number Seven. At this rate this game may become very short. Shit. He killed another one. I think so, that looked real to me. That looked fucking real, wow. You better get this guy. What do you think we're trying to do? I mean look, this guy's using these splitters and relays and so what it does it bounces a signal all around the world, that's gonna be really hard to catch. Listen, we gotta get this motherfucker, it's no joke anymore. I thought it was a joke before, maybe. I'm gonna get him. My uncle. Hey, yey, yey, yey. You can't just come in here. Hey, I don't care who your uncle is, I don't care if he's the president of the United States, you can't- You don't get it. You can't just force- I just watched my uncle die online. - All right, I understand. - Everyone, I got it. Someone blew his fucking head off. Come on, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. - I understand. - I got it. I got it. - All right. Give me a second here. I got it. Nobody's against you. Now, who's your uncle? Jose Mendez, went missing last night. Thought I just had too much to drink, then I see him on this website. What the hell is he doing on a website? I just know his fucking head blew off. You saw that? Oh yeah. Listen pal, he's my partner, Eddie Malone. You go ahead and give him a statement. I wanna know all about your uncle and everything that's going on. All right, we'll go from there. Okay? Do you trust me? Yeah. All right, I got you back, okay? Please, you got to find him. Oh, I will. I will, go ahead. Come on. I'll take your statement. Thanks, Casey. You really think it wasn't real, right? I hope not. Just CGI or some trick. It's a joke or something stupid. We'll find out. I promise you that. Take it easy. What do you make of that, man? Oh, that's... That's rough. We got to do it, man. We got to go. I think that I might be able to find this guy if we can find one of the stronger signals. Yeah, okay. So what does that mean? Road trip. Okay. So you're driving. Okay, let's get this game started before there aren't any players left. The audience will choose which one of you will initiate the proceedings. Number Three, go to your trunk and pick the object of your choice. You have 15 seconds to comply or you will be eliminated. 10. Six. Return to the monitor. Ah, excellent choice. Now, extend the blade. Extend the blade, final warning. Now, place it beneath your right thumbnail. Right thumbnail, final warning. Remove your nail. Remove your nail. Enough. I've had enough. I don't know who is doing this or why but as head of the board of education I strongly object to what is going on here. School is no longer in session, Number One. You don't make the rules here and you're in no position to give orders, do you understand? Same goes for you, Number Four. So what? A broken nail. I've seen worse. From now on you must obtain the most likes or you will be eliminated. What the fuck? Round one, completed. Football is a game. Baseball is a game. This is a shits how. Where's the sportsmanship? The skill? It's a game, where's the skill? This is violence for the sake of violence. You think some sicko is gonna get off watching this? And the internet today has created quite the buzz with a new website that has emerged that has everyone talking. A sinister force that calls himself the Warden, claims to have eight unwilling participants playing a twisted game on the internet. It's unknown at this time if this is a real big hoax or people are actually watching real life murders. Films like Saw and Hostile have now led the way to a website capitalizing on this brand of quote unquote "Entertainment." People are watching and the numbers are increasing by the minute. Authorities are currently investigating this illegal dark website to see if this is fact or fiction. Warning, this site is not for the squeamish, viewer discretion is advised. Rachel, are you all right? It hurts. Can you wrap it? I did. Good. Who is this Warden guy? I don't know but we better figure something out before it gets any worse. Three people are already dead. How much worse can it get? Well, if Mr. Curtis were still with us he'd probably say, "Three times two times worse." Jesus, why did this guy pick my school? Did we flunk some psychopath recently? This isn't the work of a disgruntled student. No, this... This is personal. Someone's idea of revenge. Well revenge or not, we'd better get these things out the back of our necks before we wind up like Jose or Curtis. Okay. What do you have in mind? I don't know, Rachel, you're the science teacher. Don't you know about anatomy? Think of something. This is a game. Every game I've ever played has a rule book, whatever it is. Roberts, can you hear us? Yeah. He's got the mics on, we can hear each other. Look, the Warden wants us to follow his every command, he thinks he's the judge and the jury and the executioner. It's up to us to find a way out of this thing. You hear me, Ms. Phillips? I guess so. We got to stay calm. You hear me, Selena? No, no, no. He's right, keep your wits. We'll get through. Stand before your monitors and wait instructions. You have 10 seconds to comply. All right, here we go. Be strong. You will have one minute to choose what task you will perform for the camera in order to be most liked by our audience. You may choose any item at your disposal. What does that mean? The individual with the least likes that deadline will be of course eliminated. This is horseshit. Get your ass in here. Me and you unless you're a pussy. Begin. I don't understand any of this. I don't belong here. I didn't do anything wrong. This is pointless. Utterly pointless. Look, I work, I go home. What? No baseball bats. Just do my job and I'm really go good at it. You have 30 seconds. You have 25 seconds. What am I supposed to do with this shit? I'm not gonna put up with this insanity any longer. I'm warning you. I need more time. Fuck. Fuck. Please. - Nine- - Fuck. Eight, seven. Fuck. Five, four, two. Wait. One. Wait, wait, wait. Your time is up. Now, what do you want me to do with this shit? You will now each perform a non-suicidal self injury with the instrument you have chosen for our audience. You have 10 seconds to complete this task or you will be eliminated. We will begin with five. What? Begin or be eliminated. Injure yourself with the instrument you've chosen. Wait. You have 10 seconds to perform your task. 10, nine, Eight. - I can't. - Seven. I'll do anything you want please. - Six, five, four. - Please. Three, two. We will now move on to Four. You have 10 seconds to perform your task. 10, nine, eight. What are you waiting for? Six. He's gonna kill you if you don't do it. Five, four, three. You'll never get away with this you sick son of a bitch. Fuck you. Way to go, Bruno. Way to go. We will now move on to two. Two? What about three? Three's next. You have 10 seconds to perform your task. You're the numbers guy. - 10. - Can't you even count? Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. You fuck. Fuck you. Fuck is this? Let this be a lesson. You will not be warned again. Burn. If you don't follow the rules you will be eliminated. Now, let's go to Number Three. You have 10 seconds to perform your task. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five. Come on Rachel, you can do it. Four, three, two. Oh. Now, let's move on to Number One. No, no, I won't do it. I won't. 10. No, I'm a role model in this community. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three. I will not participate in this sick twisted little game of yours. Three, two. Oh God. And now the voting begins. Our audience will choose which of you will be liked most. I guess people like surprises. One is the most liked. Five, you're eliminated. What? No. I'll do something else. I'll do... I'll do whatever you want, please just please. I'll do something else. Rachel, help me please. Please let me out. Now we're cooking with gas. Fuck. What? Killed another one. Okay now listen, I don't wanna waste a bunch of gas driving around. We're getting closer, brother. We're getting closer. How do you do that stuff? Uh, you don't want to know. I wanna get that cock sucker. We'll get him. Yeah, Seesaw 69, the remake, Starring The Warden. Remember Gary Ridge way? Serial killer. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 49 women he killed? Yeah, yeah. He used to go back and visit his victims and they asked him why he would go back to them and he said, "Well, you know, it's too expensive to find a new one, we're spending a fortune on gas." I spend a lot of money on gas. You got to be kidding me. No, he... He actually said that. Casey, Tanner. Yeah. We just received a call. Someone identified that last victim. Her name is Selena Marshall, she's a local. Teaches at Wootton High. Also went missing yesterday, it wasn't reported. Okay, we're almost there. Someone also thinks they saw Coach Roberts on the site. He also teaches a Wootton. So I guess this shit just got real. Shit. Rachel, are you there? Can you hear me? I'm sorry about Selena. She was a good... She was a good person. A lot of good that does her now. A lot of good that does any of us. Without a gas mask there's no scientific way to survive mustard gas poisoning. That's what that was? Pretty sure, judging by her reaction. It's a hell of a way to go. She will be missed. Unlike another teacher who was recently let go. Why bring her up now? Have you noticed the music that's been playing after each one of us dies? How could you not? It's annoying as hell. It's an old nursery rhyme called, 10 Little Indians. That's just a coincidence. You sure about that? Hey, what are you two talking about in there? Hold on a second, somebody's on the other side. Roberts, is that you? Yeah. What's left of me. How's your face, pal? It hurts like a mother. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. Yeah, if he doesn't kill us first. Listen, I have a plan. Great, what is it? When the time is right just be ready. Hang in there. I'm gonna get us out of this, you know I can. You got it. Rachel, be ready. The coach has a plan. He's not the only one. What have you got? It started with eight of us, the Warden makes nine and if we count Charlotte- Dammit, would you give it up, Rachel. It's terrible what happened to the woman but she's dead, she can't be behind any of this. Welcome back to the next round of our little game. Monitors please, instructions coming. 10 seconds to comply. Number One, 10 seconds to comply or be eliminated. Final warning, Number One. Comply now. Oh. As before, you will now perform a non-suicidal self injury with an instrument from your locker. You are each provided with a duplicate item, however, the audience will vote on the item and how you use it to be liked. Once again, I call bullshit. Audience, vote now. Audience has chosen item eight, the pliers, in a silent vote. Our audience was asked what task you will perform with the pliers. The overwhelming majority voted for extraction of a tooth of your choosing, failure to comply will lead yes to your elimination. 20 seconds to comply. Silent vote my ass. Come in here right now, little bitch. 20, 19, 18, 17. Whatever. 16, 15. 10. Five. Bring it. I'm good to go. As before, you will perform an non-suicidal self injury with the instrument chosen by our audience. Once chosen, you have 10 seconds to comply. The refusal to do so will result in your immediate elimination. Audience, vote now to see who begins. Two will begin this round. You have 10 seconds to comply. You got it rigged. This is your plan? Fucking meat head. Six. You and me, bring it now. - Four. - Come on. - Three, two. - Do it. One. That's what I thought. The audience has voted to award each captive a free pass to be used as they see fit. Audience my ass. You have to be kidding me. However- However. It must be earned. Earned. The fuck is that? It's something you should be well acquainted with in your profession. You just received the concentrated injection of horse steroids and some other little goodies. It should really get your blood pumping. You know I got a bad heart. You most certainly do. It was very, very bad. Now we'll all get to see if you have the guts. What did you do? It's in my body. It's growing inside me. I'm sorry. I feel you. I feel... I see you get out! You're coming out. You're coming out. You're coming out. You're coming out. Look, I did it. See? See? Look. Look. I did it. Why are you doing this? I don't deserve to be treated this way, none of us do. Charlotte. Rachel, come here. Come take one with me. Oh fuck. He just killed Coach Roberts online. Okay, listen we need some answers. We need them right now. How do we find this fucker? I know. I know. Casey, Casey, I got him. I got him, he's in the warehouse district. You better be right, Tanner. You know I kind of miss the old days before this, all this computer shit and "Brings people together" my ass. All it does is inspire everybody to destroy ourselves quicker, that's it. Yeah, unfortunately I don't know how the world would survive without the worldwide web these days. We'll find a way. We'll find a better way without this virtual bullshit. Says the man without any friends, real or online. You know what? Friendship needs to be earned and not just retweeted, that's not where friendship comes from. It's not something that comes out of social media, it's something that comes from a different place. A different time. Yeah, you're right. Right, Casey, it's right up here. Okay. Right here. Let's go in. Charlotte. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Why? Why are you showing me your photo? Rachel, who are you talking to? What's going on? Can you hear me? I'm here. I heard you talking to someone. I was talking to myself. I do that when I get nervous, scared. No, I get that. So much for Coach Robert's plan. I don't know what he was thinking. He should have just listened. If we play the game we buy more time. Time enough to die. No, don't you say that. We can get through this. There's three of us left now. Then there were three. Jesus, Rachel, you've got to give it up. This has nothing to do with that. This has everything to do with it. Before we started talking a photo flashed on my screen, it was a picture of Charlotte, Charlotte Knight. Charlotte Knight is dead. Who in the heck is Charlotte Knight? She was a teacher at our high school, the theater department. I thought we defunded that program. Yes, Mr. Turner, we did based on your forced budget cuts. Uh, wait a minute. It was your decision on which after school programs we were gonna lose or cut. Yes, yes it was and we all signed off on it, it was a unanimous decision. Like we had much of a choice. You sure as hell weren't going to cut the sports program or the math and science divisions. It's always the arts that has to go. This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to focus on getting out of here. Have either of you been paying attention? We are all connected to what happened to Charlotte. Mr. Turner initiated the cutback. You carried out the directive and we all supported it. The theater meant everything to Charlotte, it was her whole life and we, we took it away from her. Nobody forced you to sign the petition, Ms. Phillips. Oh the hell you didn't. Look, we all agreed, the play she wanted to do was too violent for high school kids. I hope the irony of that decision isn't lost on you now. It doesn't matter anyway we're all gonna die, it's just a question of how. And we're back. The three remaining Indians, I mean, players. Stand before your monitors and await further instructions. I take it by now you have all come to understand at some level why you are here. Your confederates have been dealt with and you must all pay for your sins. Sins you committed. Sins that an innocent paid for with her life, a life cut short, a debt is owed. I still don't have a clue what you're talking about. I don't belong in here. I don't even know what I did to deserve this. I think you've made a mistake here. 10 little, nine little, eight little Indians, seven little, six little, five little Indians, four little, three little, two little Indians. And what is this "Little Indian" thing all about? For your information, the correct term is Native American. 10 Little Indians was a novel and then a play later written by A gather Christie. It's about 10 people who are invited by an unknown host to an isolated location, where they're accused of crimes and then murdered one by one. Charlotte was planning on putting on that play at the high school before it was deemed inappropriate by Principal Bruno, who in turn sent out a letter that all the members of the faculty signed, thus resulting in the cancellation of her show and the entire theater department dismantled. Charlotte died soon after these events. How? The coroner report said it was suicide. The coroner report was wrong. Who said that? Who is that? Is somebody else out there? Help, please help us. Thank you, Number Three, for filling us in. Now, one of you was in a position to help Charlotte but did not. You did not help a young woman who was in need, all due to increase the bottom line and out of fear you did nothing. Therefore, you will each perform an non-suicidal self injury with the instrument chosen by our audience. Once chosen, you will have 20 seconds to comply, refusal to do so will result in your immediate elimination. The voting will begin now. You heard that, right? Yeah. The Warden's not alone. Who is she? Where is she? Our audience has chosen instrument Number One, the drill. You have 20 seconds to secure your drill and return to the camera. 20, 19. Wait. 18. Wait. 17. - This isn't fair. - 16. I was the only one who participated in the last round. 13, 12. Remember the pliers? 10. The tooth. Don't I get bonus points for this? Seven. Hurry up. Four, three, two. You know that Coach Roberts was right. This whole thing is rigged. As mentioned previously, you will each perform an non-suicidal self injury with your drill. However, before we begin each of you will be given an opportunity to defend yourselves and your actions with regard to the death of Charlotte Knight. I had nothing to do with her death. My conscience is clear. I never even met the girl. Should our audience believe your defense you'll be rewarded with a pass and will not be required to participate in this round. They didn't participate in the last round I was the only one who did, you moron. Disrupt the game once more and you will be eliminated, Number One. And by the way, I'm quite aware that the tooth you pulled was a prosthesis. You lost that tooth years ago and had it replaced with a painted acrylic one, it was a fake. So? You told us we could use any tooth of our choosing. I was still playing by your rule. Enough. What the hell? This isn't water. Correct, it's kerosene. Interrupt me again and you will be playing this round with item number two, the propane torch. Actually, due to these outbursts, one shall be punished. He has lost the opportunity to defend himself in regards to the death of Charlotte Knight and must now proceed with the self injury using his drill. He has five seconds to comply. Five, four, three, two. You know what? Screw you. You motherfucker, I'm gonna get you you bastard. You son of a bitch, you motherfucker. We will resume momentarily. Holy shit. What happened? Number One just lit up like a Roman candle on the 4th of July. Looks like the whole room went up in flames. Good. Good? Why the hell is that good? Because where there's fire there's smoke. Captain this is Detective Casey, I need a chopper to fly over the warehouse district. Tell him to light up all the abandoned buildings in this whole area, over. Okay. What's it searching for? Look for a thick black smoke. You were right, we are gonna die. Well, whose fault is that? Don't you put this off on me. Charlotte and I were friends, she told me she begged you not to cancel her show and cut her apartment. She lived for the theater and you knew it. Do I need to remind you that you signed that piece of paper like everyone else? If that's what led to her suicide it's on all of us. You forced me to sign it, you blackmailed me. I guess I forced you to fuck Simon too, didn't I? I didn't know. I told you I never met her husband. He never told me he was married, he wasn't even wearing a ring. It's not my fault. Simon picked me up that night at the bar. Why didn't you just tell her what happened? I knew if she found out it would've destroyed her. Well, I guess you were right. How clairvoyant of you. Wait, did you tell her, you son of a bitch? That's the only reason I signed your goddam letter so she wouldn't find out. You promised you wouldn't say a word. You weren't there when I had to give her the bad news. She was angry, she came at me. She blamed me for ruining her career. I just simply said, if she were more concerned about her home life as she was her professional life, well, maybe. You asshole. You told her. She figured it out for herself. And she killed herself. Her job, her passion, her marriage, all on the same day and we drove her to it. We are responsible. Thank you for your patience. Due to the unscheduled elimination of Number One we are now down to only two players. Therefore, we shall skip ahead to the final lightning rounds of the game. Number Three and Four stand before your monitors, you have five seconds to comply. Five, four, three, two, one. As the final two, our audience has silently voted that if you use your head the winner will be unleashed. However, only one of you will be allowed this opportunity. The question is, how far are you willing to go to be liked? Audience my ass. It's only you out there, whoever you are. You will each be given 30 seconds to be liked. There will be three lightning rounds. The captive most liked will be freed, the other eliminated. You will have two minutes to consider your strategy and items of use. What if we refuse? What? What if we just refuse? We stop playing this sick game. We just refuse. Then we just die. Her blood is on our hands. We are responsible. No, we are not. School programs get cut all the time. Husbands cheat on wives. Charlotte had her choice and she chose to die. This is just some sick vendetta. Vendetta? Oh my God, I think I know who's behind this. Care to fill me in? Look, Rachel. My fight's not with you, it's with this sick fucker doing this. Live or die, it's got to be on our own terms. Before we get started I think it's only fair that we share with everyone watching who the Warden really is. Do tell. Come on, Simon, I know you're behind this. Show yourself. Oh my God, Simon. Sorry, Number Three. Simon Knight is not the one calling the shots here. In fact, he was the first one to be captured, the spine that he is. Now, where were we? So then who the fuck are you? Uh, uh, sorry, only one guess at a time during the lightning round. Now, our audience will vote as to which of you they feel has been the most contrite and will reward that person appropriately. At the end of the three rounds the individual most like will be unleashed. For the first round you will have 15 seconds to perform your penance. Round one begins now. 10, nine, eight, seven, six. Five, four, three, two, one. What are you seeing up there? Over. There's signs of smoke generating from warehouse seven located in the rear. Listen, call for backup 'cause I think we might have found this son of a bitch, all right and I hope it's not too late. Four is in the lead. Ready for lightning round two? Would you care to take another guess who is behind this? I'll give you a hint, there's nothing like a woman scorned, nothing. No, it can't be. It can't be Charlotte, I was at her funeral. She's fucking dead. I was there too. This can't be 10 Little Indians for real. Yes, Rachel. My daughter is dead. You took her away from me. You all did by your actions and now you're going to repent. This is your last opportunity for redemption. Oh, what the fuck? This is about a mother's revenge? Who the fuck is this guy? Uncle Joe? It's a hired hand doing the Lord's work. As I said, I am the Warden. I see to it that justice is served. I write the wrongs in society. Consider me a Dark Avenger for our dark times. When I heard what happened to Charlotte, I happily took Mrs. Pine's case free of charge. Thank you. But enough about me, lightning round two begins now. You will continue to acquire as many likes as possible, the winner who is most liked at the end of the third and final round will be set free. Now the question remains, how far are you willing to go to be liked? Why don't you show us your face? Or are you afraid? Now as with the first round you will have 15 seconds to perform your penance. Begin now. Four, you have no instrument, you must participate or be eliminated. No, I'm done with this bullshit game. Number Four, are you stating that you will no longer participate? It's my understanding of the rules that you stated that the one with the most likes at the end of the final round will be afforded the opportunity to be released. I'm saying it's Number Three, Rachel Phillips. I'm calling the shots. I'm making the decisions. You can't play this game with only one person. Uh, so be it. No, make him die slowly. Never argue with a vengeful mother. No, stop. Number Three, you have five seconds to comply or you will suffer the same fate. Five, four, three, two, one. I believe school is now out of session. You son of a pitch. Round three starts now, Number Three, choose your item and continue with your penance. Once you have been liked 10,000 times you will be freed. Wait, I had more likes than that. You have to earn your freedom. Begin. What's that? Looks like we have company. Our little game might be coming to an end soon. Continue, Number Three, 7,000 more likes than you could be free. It's all up to you now. No, I want them to die, I want them to all die. Now, that's not very sporty. I'm not leaving until it's over. Enough. Again. Freeze, asshole. You dumb fuck. Warden, it's your stupid nickname, huh? Don't fucking move. Congratulations, gentlemen. You arrived just in time for the finale. Go ahead, make a move and I'll blow your brains Goddamn brains out. Okay, I won't but you have to if you wanna save that final girl. I'm sorry about Charlotte, I am. I didn't mean to hurt her. It was all a terrible mistake. Simon tricked me. Bruno lied to me. I'd take it all back if I could, I swear. Than do it. 10,000 likes remember? Fine. Is this what you want? Is it? Yes. Fuck you all. Where's Rachel? She's here, still alive. I think. Where is she? Well, that gets a little complicated. Start down that hallway, take a left then take a right then take two lefts down the staircase through the tunnel. Why don't you show us, dickhead? That means I'd have to move. Then move and move now, get over here. You need to lock your fingers behind your Goddamn head before I blow it off. As you wish. Go that way, I'll go this way. Okay. You lose my dear. 10,000 likes, remember? I win even if you kill me now. I beat you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Die, die. You got to die. Die. I got you. I got you. Casey, Casey, did you get him? Uh shit. Fuck you. This game is survival, life and death. You know the rules. Tanner! Tanner! Come on, Tanner. Okay, freeze bitch. Don't shoot, I'm unarmed. He was torturing me for hours. Thank goodness you found me. It was horrible. He had me tied up in that control room. Did you see his face? No, he wore a mess the entire time. Listen, you're gonna be okay. No, it's not. Holy sweet Jesus, you're Rachel, the one we've been looking for. Hey, it's me. Listen, I need a medic and ambulance, warehouse district right away. Do you copy? How's it going, Detective Casey? Who the fuck is this? The guy with a nickname. Come on now, you know who this is. Where are you, asshole? So this is the button for the siren, huh? He's in my fucking car. All right listen, I'll get you to the hospital myself, okay. Take care of this asshole, all right. I'll take care of you. How? There's one thing I learned today is to never give up. At the end of the three rounds the individual most liked will be unleashed. You will have 15 seconds to perform your penance. Round one begins now. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You got to die. Die. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please. I'm sorry too. Where the hell are you, bastard? Now, now, detective. That would be telling. I say we put a pin in it until the rematch. Where the fuck are you? I'm gonna get you, man. Hey, the hell is this? The hell am I? Son of a bitch. Oh my God. Please, please. Is anybody there? Look, my family's rich. Oh. Hey. No more fooling around. Get me the fuck out of here. Why me? What did I do wrong? Come on. Speak to me. Listen, you don't have to lock me up. Whoever's doing this better let me the fuck go right now or I'm gonna twist off your stupid head. I can be an asset to you. I can help you. And use your skull to crush those teeny tiny nuts of yours. Let me go and I swear I will not tell anyone, I promise. I don't want to die here. Come on. Let's negotiate. Anything you want. What is this? A game. Ladies and gentlemen allow me to introduce myself. I am the Warden and I have gathered you all here to participate in a little game and like most games, the rules are simply not in your favor. I can't stop watching. I mean, I can't... I can't look away from it. I can't push myself away from it. I find the whole thing truly disgusting, degrading, irreprehensible. I think it's fake. I think everything in the world is fake nowadays. You can't believe anything you see anymore. That got me thinking, you know, it's like, what does that say about me as a human being. It's truly sickening but I can't stop watching. I would just turn it off. Just turn it off. If you can.
