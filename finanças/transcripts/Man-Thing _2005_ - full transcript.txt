-(INSECTS BUZZING) -(BIRDS SQUAWKING) (MAN NARRATING) There is a sacred place in the deep swamp... where the mangrove trees grow close together... and the rays of the sun are never seen. My people call this place the "Dark Water." It is here that the spirit of the swamp lives. (THUNDERCLAP) This place was always filled with life and beauty. But evil men have changed that... with their drills, their pipes... greed and murder. Now the swamp cries out a warning: A time of retribution is here.

(SHOUTING CONTINUES) I gotta get out of this town. -Why would you wanna leave paradise? -Geez! (SIGHS) -Man, you scared the shit out of me. -Sorry about that. I'm Kyle Williams, the new sheriff. You must be Eric Fraser, yeah? Yeah. Fraser'll do. -What? -No offense, but-- Well, I just expected someone more-- more experienced, -I mean, considerin'-- -Considering what? (FRASER) See, Sheriff Corely, he, uh-- Well-- He kind of went insane before he disappeared. (KYLE) That's a lot of missing persons for a small town. I guess they didn't fill you in all the way. It started with this Indian medicine man-- Ted Sallis. He was the first one to disappear. Corely thought Sallis put a curse on Bywater. Hey, I can take all this down. Leave it. -So what do you think, Fraser? -I don't know. Gator attacks. Murder, possibly. Possibly. Another one disappeared last night. Local boy. Billy James. -Jesus. -Yeah. Who's Rene Laroque? He's a local troublemaker. Corely thought he and Sallis were in this together. Called him a shape-shifter. -But we could never catch him. -Why can't you catch him? Why can't we catch him? Hell, you ain't never been in that swamp before, have you? Well-- (RINGING) Deputy Fraser. Hey, Val. It's the coroner. Whoa, whoa. What? (GASPS) Oh, my God. Is that Billy? Yeah. -That's Billy. -(GAGGING) Fraser, you go wait outside. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cause of death? Only thing around here large enough to do this, Sheriff, is a gator. There's a girl that was with him. She might've seen what happened. She's down at the hospital here. Is this normal? This green stuff? Sheriff, this body has been in the swamp. You understand? Yeah, for one night. Mr. Schist just called. There's a disturbance at the oil site. Can you go? I'd like to stick with this right now. Mr. Schist asked if you could handle it personally. Said he wants the new sheriff to see what he's been up against. Okay. -I want a full autopsy. -You got it. (MAN OVER BULLHORN) I appreciate your right to free assembly... but this here's private property. Now, we can cut you out one by one... or one of you can tell me where the key is to that chain. This is not a goddamn playground. This is a work site! -Surely you got a home to go to, girlie. -(SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) Now, I've been real patient with you folk. -But you all are trespassin'. -You just listen to the man! I'm givin' you one last chance to disperse! Or else, I'm gonna drag you out by that chain-- Fraser, I'm real glad you're here. -I want all these folk arrested. -Now, now,Jake. This is Kyle Williams, our new sheriff. -Sheriff, this is Jake Schist. -Mornin'. He's a foreman here for his dad, headin' up the new drillin' operations. Good. You can arrest 'em. Arresting all of them might be a little difficult. Let me see what I can do. All right, everyone! I appreciate your right to free assembly... but this is a privately-owned work site. -(YELLING, SHOUTING) -Your actions here are illegal. You gotta get your asses up out of the mud and go home. -Who the hell are you? -I'm the new sheriff, ma'am. Well, have a taste of country hospitality, Sheriff. Our asses aren't goin' anywhere. Why don't y'all go fuck a tree, ya hippie bitch? -Here. -Got it, chief. Ma'am, right or wrong, this is my job. This is about a different kind of law, Sheriff. Schist has been committing a crime against these people... on this land for long enough. You got handcuffs. Put 'em on Schist. -(PROTESTORS MURMURING IN AGREEMENT) -Bolt cutters. What are you doin'? -(PROTESTORS LAUGHING) -Sheriff, I-I'm sorry. Are you all right? -Walk or ride? -What did you say? Put me down! What are you're doin'? This is a violation of my civil rights! -Put me down now! -You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. -Who do you think you are? -Fraser, cut everyone loose. I want to speak to my attorney! -You have the right to an attorney. -I want a lawyer! If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. -Get in the car. -(GRUNTS) You had better be arresting me, 'cause I'm gonna kick your city-boy a-- Got in straight to work, Sheriff. I like that. Howdy, Sheriff. Frederic Schist. Hell of a way to spend your first day on the job, Kyle. I hate this. I really do. These are good folk. I sympathize. Can't let the goddamn flies spoil the picnic, Sheriff. You're gonna hear a lot about me around here. I'm the big fish in the small pond. Bottom line is, I'm not breakin' any laws. Not any American laws anyways. And I paid a bundle for this land. What do you mean, "American laws"? Well, you're gonna hear that honey that you arrested... singin' about tribal laws. Horseshit excuses for terrorists... to put sand in my gears. But is there something you wanna tell me? Something specific? You're a straight shooter, ain't you? I like that. Well, there is someone specific. Rene Laroque. He's part Indian. Hell, he could be out there in the swamp killin' people. Lives out there like an animal. Sir, before I arrest anybody, I need to conduct my own proper investigation. Of course you do. What I'm sayin' is, it needs to be sooner rather than later. Let me tell you-- when the dust has settled... you'll find this a nice place to live. -Isn't that right,Jake? -Yes, sir. Real nice place to live. -I'll make sure of it. -Thank you, Mr. Schist. Get that dozer movin'! Pa. He's kind of young to be a sheriff, ain't he? Yes, he is. That's the idea. -(KYLE) Name? -Teri Elizabeth Richards. -Occupation? -I teach third grade. You think getting arrested's setting a good example for your students? I think standin' up for your principles sets a good example. So, yes, I do. So, you've been arrested five times. One more and you get the decoder ring. Sheriff, that swamp has been my backyard since I was born. It's part of me, and I happen to love it. That's not Schist's land. It's ancestral land, and it's sacred to the tribe. Besides, the tribe didn't see a cent of Schist's money. Their leader, Ted Sallis, took it and ran. Okay. Okay, I'm listening. No one wants to see, because Schist is so busy pumpin' money into the town. But, Sheriff, this swamp is dying. People are dying. (KYLE) Rene Laroque. Do you know him? Sheriff, this is a small town. Everybody knows everybody. -Can you help me find him? -He's not that easy to find. Okay. You can go. -You're not chargin' me? -Like you said, it's a small town. So if I was to charge a third-grade schoolteacher whose worst crime... is caring for the environment... on my first day-- That's not the way I'd like to get started. -You can go. -Fine. -Mornin', Sheriff. -How you doin'? (CHATTERING) (CHATTERING STOPS) I thought diners were supposed to be friendly. Well, for the new sheriff, first coffee's free. -Thank you. -Second one is twice the price. -There you go. -Thanks. -Mornin', Sheriff. -How you doin'? What brings you here-- warrant or pleasure? Got a sweet tooth. Well, Sheriff Williams, meet another sugar addict. This is Pete Horn. Pete, this is the nice man that arrested me yesterday. Howdy. Pleased to meet you, Sheriff. Pleasure, Pete. -Do you mind? -Here. -Breakfast, Sheriff? -Eggs and grits, I guess. (DOGS GROWLING, BARKING) -Can I help you? -No, I don't think you can. But I could help you. Welcome to Dodge City, Sheriff. This is the showdown, man. All the legends around here are true. -It's incredible. -Yeah? Come out to my place in the swamp, man, and I could show you some things... if you have the courage to believe. Ploog! What the hell you doin', you freaky piece of shit? -(BARKING) -Heel, boys. Heel. I told you not to bring them dogs in here. -I didn't realize you were the law here. -You're lucky I didn't eat 'em. (LAUGHING) Good luck, Sheriff. You have a fine time with the Bywater breakfast club. I've seen this show before. I gotta go. Bye, Pete. -You take care. -Got a kiss for me? Yeah, right. Don't go fillin' the new sheriff's head with your bullshit, Ploog. Hey. Don't pay him no never mind, Sheriff. -He coon crazy. -Crazy as a coon. Hey! -That sure is one shiny new badge. -Hey, hey. -Don't put your hands on me, mister. -Thibodeaux. -Wayne Thi-bo-deaux. -Yeah. Why don't you take your friend, Mr.-- Rodney Thibodeaux. We're brothers. Well, your mother must be proud. So, please, sit down, gentlemen. Let a man have his coffee. Hey! I was just foolin'. Just jokin' with ya.

(PETE SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) (OVER RADIO) Sheriff? Fraser. Schist wants you back over at the work site. Thanks for fittin' us into your busy schedule, Sheriff. Fraser could've come out earlier. I think you need to see this for yourself. -You had some vandalism here last night? -You could call it that. Had to cancel an entire day's work. They hit every rig. Slashed the belts, slashed the pipes. Hell, this time, they stole some dynamite. I'm already months behind here. You understand, Sheriff? You gonna do a damn thing about Rene Laroque, or just take pictures? You think this was done by Laroque? (LAUGHS) Hell, yeah! Red-skinned motherfucker. And that old madman Pete Horn, he's behind this too. Yeah? Don't you think he's a little old to be running a revolution? It don't make no difference how old they get. You can't trust 'em-- injuns and coloreds both. -Steve, I don't think the sheriff needs-- -They hate us! The first chance they get, they strike at you. First thing, they're snoopin' around stealin' things. Next thing you know, they'll burn this place to the ground. You see if they don't. You can't trust 'em. Shit. There's all kinds of people you can't trust in this world, mister. I put racist assholes at the top of that list. Hey, come on, bubba. They all think I ripped 'em off. Hell, Sheriff, I was the one that overpaid for swampland. It was that old crook Sallis who started this. It was! He skipped town with the money. He's one of their own. Someone breaks the law, they have my full attention. But as far as I'm concerned, this is an open case until I get hard evidence. Whatever your beliefs are, Sheriff, you better take care. There's more things in that swamp than you'll ever understand. This is a dark corner of the world, boy. You better keep your lights on. Yeah, go ahead, Sheriff. I'm drivin' back from the work site, checkin' the perimeter of the swamp. I'm losing you, Sheriff. You be careful out there, Sheriff. ♪ (ROCK) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GUTTURAL GROWL, FAINT) What? Shit.

He's been missin' for over a month. How'd you end up findin' him? Just lucky, I guess. Right. Noticed somethin' here. See this? Right around here? Classic bite pattern of a large mississippiensis-- common southern alligator. -There's no doubt about this one. -This one? (RINGING) Mind gettin' that? Please? -County coroner's office. -Sheriff? Yeah. Fraser, speak up. Clean up. I need you on a field trip. Cool. I'll get my kit, Sheriff. You okay? Now, you focus, Eric. You can be freaked out later, but not on the job. Yeah. -What the hell could do that? -I don't know. Could this be some kind of... ritualistic thing? (SIGHS) I have no idea, Sheriff. No idea at all. (COUGHS) How can you shove a branch down someone's throat like that? Let me show you something. See the teeth? Position of the tongue? Sheriff, this branch wasn't shoved in. It's comin' from the inside out. -See, the other bodies-- -What other bodies? (EXHALES) I need a cigarette. -Do you have to smoke? -Definitely. Sheriff, three of our missin' persons... they washed up over the past several months. Now, they all had-- Well, not like this, Sheriff, but more like Billy, you know? Swamp stuff growin' inside of 'em... comin' out from inside, you understand? Why wasn't this in the file? Corely wouldn't even let me do an autopsy on 'em, Sheriff. -He insisted I file them as gator attacks. -What did you think they were? -Hell, I-I figured, what the fuckin' else could they be? -(SCHIST) What the hell? Goddamn it! What man could do that? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (TERI) Sheriff! I just talked to Val. You're going to get Rene, aren't you? Teri, please, just let me do my job. What, you're gonna hunt him down like some kind of animal? If he's innocent, then he'll walk. But I can't just sit on my hands and watch other people die. -Rene would never do something like that. -How do you know that? I saw Rene less than two miles from where Steve Gerber was murdered. -If he's the one behind it-- -Sheriff! -You're not listening to me. I know Rene. -Yeah, well, that's pretty obvious. -Hey, Kyle! -What? I think Jake Schist is hirin' the Thibodeauxs to go after Rene. Don't you see what's goin' on here? (FRASER) We'd better get over there and talk to 'em. -I'll lock up. -Goddamn it! (COUGHING) -You smell that? -That's bad. (WHISTLING) What y'all doin' out here, Fraser? Shoppin' for somethin' for your new girlfriend there? Well, Rodney, your mama called my mama... and she told my mama that Jake was out here gettin' you boys... mixed up in our investigation. Hey.

(CHUCKLING) Jake here was just tellin' us what happened to Steve Gerber. -Nasty. -Real bad. Yeah. I'd appreciate you not discussing the investigation. Hey, get them heads out the formaldehyde! Shit! I bet you overcooked 'em. When they get overcooked, the skin bursts. They dry all crackly-lookin' and weird. -Fucked up? -Nope. We're good. Well, lacquer 'em up quick.

Yeah, I met him. -He's a weird guy. -Yeah, that's Ploog, all right. Moved here about six months ago. Took a place right in the middle of the swamp. Told me he saw the Loch Ness monster when he was a boy. What's at Ploog's? He's got a couple extra canoes tied up to his porch. We'll need 'em if we wanna get home. Or go deeper, if that plan still stands. What are you afraid of, Fraser? The Dark Water. Sacred land, man. If I was Rene, that's where I'd be. And I can show you to the edge... but badge or no badge, that's as far as I'll go. You really believe in all this? I believe that when a man's chest becomes an insect's palace... when his eyes are gone and his limbs ain't there no more... and when I'm so scared I wanna handcuff myself to my bed... to keep from comin' to work-- yeah, I believe it, man.

Joining the hunt, Sheriff. (GROWLS) -Mike? -(CREAKING) -Is somebody there? Hello? -(WATER SPLASHES) Didn't I tell you to go home? If you're not who they say you are, just cut me down. Who do they say I am? They say you're the one responsible for people disappearing. -(CHUCKLES) No. -Then who is? Only the swamp knows the answer to that. -Not everyone's against you, Rene. -Yeah? There are some people who believe you're innocent. No one is innocent, Sheriff, especially not me. I convinced Schist to buy up all the Indian land--the swampland. So you sold out. We had nothing. I thought the money would help the tribe. -What went wrong? -Ted Sallis wouldn't sell. I thought he did sell. (CHUCKLES) That man would never have sold this land, and he would never have run. Are you saying Ted Sallis was murdered? I'm saying, right after he disappeared... Schist stuck a rig in the center of our most sacred place, the Dark Water. The guardian here won't stop until the flow of oil has stopped. -Pete Horn said something was out here. -We never once saw eye-to-eye. But Pete thinks his prayers can stop it. -I've got my own plans. -(SCREECHING, GROWLING) Run, or it'll kill you! Rene, wait! Hey, Kyle, is that you? Kyle, over here! Man, it's good to see you.

I made tea. -Thank you, Pete. -How'd you know we'd be here? -It's good tea. Pete, I need to ask you some questions about Rene Laroque. He told me he doesn't believe Ted Sallis sold that land. Not many who knew Ted do. What about you? Ted Sallis was my elder. He knew this land was sacred. When Schist took it... drove his pumps into it... ran his pipes through it... it was the end. Our stories will die with me. Hey, come on. Pete, listen to me. You're not dying anytime soon. Do you remember when I took you to the Dark Water as a child, Teri? -I remember I was scared. -Yes. It is full of magic-- both light... and dark. Our most powerful guardian spirit lives in the Dark Water. It protects what our ancestors called the "nexus of all realities." -The guardian has become very angry. -(SCREECHING) For the blood spilled, it seeks blood. (SCREECHING CONTINUES) Pete, I'm a cop. I can't believe in Indian spirits and magic. What you believe doesn't matter. You're not from this place. You're not from anyplace. Where's Ted Sallis, Pete? -Is he the one killing people? -Kyle, wait! Is he killing people with or without Rene? I didn't bring you here to do this. Maybe he is in the swamp. Maybe the swamp is in him. Whoever or whatever is out there, Pete, I saw it. What did you see? -I don't know. -You know what you saw. -It has chosen who will die. -(KYLE) Who? Who will die, Pete? Everyone. -(CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) -Hey. Hey. Hey, Pete. Pete, come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't-- Sit down, okay? -Is he okay? -(TERI) I don't know. (PETE) I'm tired. Please go now. Yeah. Just rest. You didn't have to do that. He's an old man, for God's sake. He's an old man who knows what the hell's going on. Listen to yourself. What are you saying? Listen, Teri. Last night, I saw something rip apart Fraser like a fucking puppet. Look, I've gotta go out in that swamp and stop whatever's killing people. It's my fault Fraser's dead, Teri. And I don't know if I can protect you. Hey, Kyle. None of this is your fault.

Nobody's gonna muscle me out of it-- not the FBI or Rene Laroque... and certainly not... some two-bit Yankee cocksucker... with a badge. Fuck you! What happened with the Thibodeauxs? -They didn't come back this morning. -Damn it,Jake! -You were supposed to go with them! -I was only trying to make sure-- Oh, yes. "I was only trying-- I'm always trying and never doing." That's your problem. Goddamn, if you learn nothing from me, you learn this-- you want something done in life, you gotta do it yourself... cause you cannot rely on anybody. Not even your own son. What are we gonna do about this then? We're gonna finish it. Tonight, I want that Laroque dead. What about... Dudley Do-Right? -He keeps on digging. -We'll let him dig. It's his own grave he's digging. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) Give me the strength. The killing ends tonight. Kyle, I think you should call the FBI. The Bureau could take days, Teri. -Schist is gonna go after Rene tonight. -Listen to me. I've been running around in that swamp since I was a kid. I can help you. You can help me by staying away from that swamp until all this is over. That swamp can play tricks on your mind, especially at night. -You don't have to do this. -Teri, listen, please. Look,Jake could be out there-- Schist, Rene. God knows what else. Can you promise me, please? Just don't go into that swamp. I'll be here when you get back. And you better get back. Okay? (RATTLE RATTLING) (CHANTING CONTINUES) (GUTTURAL GROWLING) (WHISPERING) Pa, I think I hear something. -(CHANTING CONTINUES) -(RATTLING CONTINUES) (GUTTURAL GROWLING CONTINUES) (WIND HOWLING) (GROWLING) I know you. I know you, and I am not afraid. Take my life and be done. (GROWLING CONTINUES) (GROANING) (PHONE RINGING) Sheriff's office. (VAL) Yeah, it's the coroner. Is the sheriff in? Val? It's Teri. -Teri, is he in? It's kind of urgent. -He's not here right now. I could get him a message. What's up? I guess you could say Corely died of unnatural causes. I pulled a bullet out of his spine. -A bullet? -Tell Kyle it was at close range. A semiautomatic handgun,.45. I think Sheriff Corely knew who killed him. -Where is Kyle? -(TERI) He's out in the swamp. (RUSTLING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (BARKING) Heel! Heel! -Get your fucking dogs off me! -I got 'em, man. Ploog, I told you to stay in fucking town! Can you smell that, Sheriff? (MUTTERS, CHUCKLES) It's the perfume of my future. -Point, click, fame. -(DOGS BARKING) There it is! Gotta go. Good luck out there, man! -It's the cover of Life magazine, man! -Life magazine! Life magazine went out of business, you fucking idiot! -(GROANS) -Jake? -Jake! -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (GASPS) -(MAN GROANS) -(DOGS BARKING) Damned if you take my picture, asshole. Pa! -(WATER SPLASHES) -(GASPS) (RUSTLING) (CREAKING) (RUSTLING) (WATER SPLASHING GENTLY) (SCREECHING, DISTANT) -(GROWLING, DISTANT) -(DOGS BARKING, DISTANT) (WATER SPLASHES) -Kyle! -(GASPS) Jesus! Teri, I almost shot you. Thank God! I had to find you. Corely was murdered. Val found a slug from a.45 in his spine. Listen, Teri, I just found Ploog. -He's dead. He was shot. -Jesus. I don't think Ted Sallis ran away with that money. I think Schist killed him for this land. Corely knew about it, so he got a bullet. -He's trying to blame it on Rene? -Rene's the last one that knows the truth. You'll never find Rene without me. I'm leading you to the Dark Water. -That's where he's been hiding out. -You've known this all along. -I knew he was innocent. -Jesus, Teri. You'll never find the Dark Water without me. -Okay? -Okay. Just keep up. -Are you sure you know where you're going? -Yeah. It's down here, I think. I've been thinking about what Pete said. -I think he might be right. -About what? -(GROWLING) -Oh, shit! About that. (TERI) This way. Come on. (GROWLING CONTINUES) Fuck. (SHOUTS) Step. (GROWLING) Stop right there, Rene! I'm begging you. I'm just achin' for an excuse. (CHUCKLING) (LAUGHING) It doesn't matter. The swamp will have you. This way! This is it. This is the last stretch before the Dark Water. -You can't see a thing in here. -(GROWLING) -(KYLE) Oh, shit! -(TERI) God, what is that? Teri, go! Go, Teri, go! Just keep moving! (BELLOWING) Shit! -Jesus! -(GROWLING) (HISSING) (KYLE) Do you see anything, Teri? Kyle, I think there's something in the water! (HOWLING, HEAVY BREATHING) (TERI SCREAMS) Oh, what's that? (KYLE) Go! Move! This thing is behind us! -Kyle, I can't see anything! -I'm here. (GASPING) How much further? How much further? (TERI) I don't know. Quick! Go! You don't scare me with that hocus-pocus, boy. You're friend, Ted Sallis, before he died... before I buried him here under this rig... you know what he said? Fuck you! He said I was settin' him free. (CHUCKLING) How about you? Y'all wanna be free, Rene? (KYLE) It's not as dark up ahead. I can see a clearing. -(LAROQUE) Quiet. -(TERI) I think it's this way. -No. -(TERI) There. I can see it. (GRUNTS) Oh, God! We gotta get the fuck out of here! Rene, what are you doing? I'm sorry, Teri. I'm sorry. My sin put this here. It's my penance to take it down. -Freeze! -(TERI) No! -God! -Pass me the gun, girl! You don't understand! Something's chasing us! Give me the gun! (KYLE) You're a murderer, Schist. You should have kept your Yankee nose out of this, boy! -You're gonna die. -Yeah! And I suppose you're gonna kill me! (LAUGHING) -No. He is. -(GASPING) -(WATER SPLASHING) -Jake? (GROWLING) (GROWLING CONTINUES) (WHIMPERING) (SHOUTS) (TERI SCREAMS) Shit! -Here it comes. -(SCREAMS) -(GUNFIRE) -(TERI) Rene, watch out! (GROWLING CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) -(GASPING) -(GRUNTING) (SCREECHES) -(SHOUTS) -It's not enough! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) Run! -(RENE) I'll set you free! -(KYLE) Teri, move! (SCREAMING) Get down! Now, Teri!
