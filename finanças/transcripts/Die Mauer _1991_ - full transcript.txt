THE WALL I can't believe it's all coming to an end. - What can you hear? - They're tapping too loud. When they stopped I could hear some noises. If you put your ear to the wall, you can hear them. - Could you stop for a minute? - Excuse me. Stop for a minute. You can hear something, even with the tapping. It's somewhere around here ...that you can hear it, somewhere here. - Where are you taking that? - To Japan. To Japan? We want it as a souvenir. That's dangerous. It's not working. Keep trying- Go on. I can't get any to come off. - What a mess! - Look, I've got two pieces of it. I can't get any off. Shit. Mehmet, what's he doing over there? Let's keep going. I haven't got any, all right? Nothing but these crappy little bits. A present. You have a go. Mehmet, where are the other bits? Take a look at this. Yeah, I did it. - Why aren't they joining in? - They don't have hammers. I brought this with me. From school. - Good luck. - Thanks, bye. - I have a cassette to pass on. - Oh yeah? - For whom? Someone from TV, Sat. 1. Oh yeah? Is the package sealed? If it is I'll get angry. He won't though, not with that thing pointing at him. Then give it to me and I'll pass it on. Name? The wall that we can see over there, the Berlin Wall, is 3 m high, 40 km long, and it cuts across the entire city. It is 3 m high and divides the city of Berlin. It is around 40 km long in total. The Brandenburg Gate has always been an important symbol for the German people, and it used to lie in the eastern half of the city. You can walk through the Doric columns of the Brandenburg Gate. I'm at the Gate, approaching the old-fashioned street sign which has the lettering used on signs before the war. It reads "Brandenburg Gate Square". We can clearly see the eastern part of the city. A view that was hidden from the west. The Unter den Linden boulevard is before me. Further back the Palast der Republik, the Red City Hall, and the TV Tower. It should be kept but not commercialized. It's an opportunity to discuss your society and your culture. And that I like. You have high-class theater, films and actors. I hope that you make the best of it. I also like Bertolt Brecht very much. And I hope that the best of him will survive too. Where do you come from? - East Germany. - From the GDR? I'm from Sweden. - Yeah. - Hello. Hello. What are you going to do? It's only for you. - Thank you very much. - You, you heard... You already taped me? - Yes. - Okay. - It's for our film. -what program is it for? - It's for a cinema film. - For what? For the cinema. It's a documentary. Open up! Dalida! Dalida, where are you? Fellow citizens! The gap in the wall is only narrow. Please remain calm. Everyone will get through. Thank you. 'Happy New Year! 'Happy New Year! 1990 will be a great year for you! Hey, everyone! Happy New Year! Hey, can I? Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Thank you. - Where are you from? - Kansas City. - You're happy here? - Yes. For sure. - Excuse me? - Good luck! Thank you.

Germ. Germ. Woodstock was nothing com pared to this. We'll have the fourth Woodstock here. And the fifth. And the sixth. Have they interviewed you yet? We're not allowed to give interviews. Oh, right. Cool. It's my first time in Berlin. - Why aren't you at the Gate? - It's too crowded there. - Are you happy the Wall is down? - Of course. Now I can visit people in the West. - Great. Know anyone there? - Yeah. - Where? - Bönen. A couple of my buddies moved over there. It's near Munster. Maybe you know it. - Where? - Near Münster. I live in Hanover. It's just a bit further down, right? - Like to visit? - What's your address? - But not in front of the camera. - Okay, fine. You can have it though. Do you have anything to write on? I'll get something and give you it. Great. - He's shy. - That's the way I am. Jaspert, come here. - Don't go too far, okay? - Don't worry. We're going straight back now. Yes, we'll do that when we get the chance. Along here... we're allowed through there. Yesterday we weren't allowed yet. - Usually that's not allowed. - We came back here again. Why have they done that? I don't know. Are they taking pictures of it? - Daddy, can we go? - How much does that cost? - How much is it? - That? Ten? Come on. We're going now. Everyone's just gawking. L-low much are those'? - This? Ten marks. - Five marks. - Hard work, huh? - Five marks. - Did you chip it out? - My cousin did. - You sell them for him? - Yeah. - Every day? - Yeah. Yesterday... - Do you get a cut of the profits? - Of course. - We get half. -what do you do with the money? - I don't spend it, I save it. - Me too. - I'm going to get a tracksuit. - That's cool, man. I'd better let you get on with your work, then. - Bye, take care. - Bye. Do you want to buy this? - Everyone here is only looking. - Ten marks. Look behind you. Yeah? Do you want it? Eight? Eight marks. - Look. You have to look there. Eight marks? Okay, eight marks. - I guess... - Five marks. - Go away. I'm dealing with this. - Five marks.

Someone should be filming this. Right. Let's just pop through. Turn left and head for the Brandenburg Gate. - Okay, you can go now. - Take care, bye. We are one people! When I look at all the cranes on Potsdamer Platz... Standing here, and looking at that is unbelievable. I just can't believe it. In a minute this image will be broadcast all over the world. In 20 seconds what happens here will be going around the world. That means you, here in Berlin, on Potsdamer Platz, are about to be joined by people from all around the world. I asked my boss for some vacation. Can you grab that? I wanted to take today off as this is something really special. Copyright © 2006 TITELBILD, Berlin Subtitles: Emily Wright et al.
