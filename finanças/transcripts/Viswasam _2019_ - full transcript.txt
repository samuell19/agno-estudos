Collector Sir, you are a respected man You know everything But one thing This Fair, unlike other places Does not happen every year It happens once in 10 years Leaving behind the motherland, the family and scattered all over Suppering all the people for the land and people This is the day our wait long to come back to The earnestness of those who have left and the anticipation of those waiting Is what makes the samplings flourish Don’t say no All those struggling to make ends meet Its the day they wait for their daughters to come with their children. They wait for their sons to bring new clothes Its a day that marks a new chapter for them Those who are separated by caste Come together as a crowd to prostrate to their God Why! Even those who don’t believe in God Come running this day to meet their people Take a good decision Let this Fair be conducted Its not a game What a serious matter this is..

Why are they all running? I guessed it What's wrong? Why are you hitting these kids? Why are you hitting them? Aren’t they going for tuition? Will you brew illicit liquor? It hurts? He’s crying and you are asking him if it hurts? What did you guys do? - Will you brew illicit liquor? Will you brew illicit liquor? He does not like illicit liquor? Just shut your crooked mouth and sit Who said? I really like liquor Whenever I come drunk My grandma would say- my dear! Don’t sleep on an empty stomach after drinking Eat something and sleep was what she used to say! In the year 1998 on March 12th around 8 in the night My grandma looked at me and said How did she say! My dear Thookudurai for how long are you going to drink like this She told me not to drink hereafter That day I decided Hereafter I should not drink From morning to evening you are hitting them Your hands will hurt Your hands will hurt The liquor that I don’t drink None should drink or brew it in the neighboring 12 village was the rule that I put out You are disobeying the rules laid Get lost Let him in!

The police station looks like a marriage hall Oh my! Thookudurai why are you counting the bars You don’t even know maths! Don’t hit me Wait! Wait! Why I was unconscious all this happened When I regained consciousness I erupted like a volcano I dragged the doctors here That lady doctor will fall at your feet and withdraw the case You will need to do another small favor You withdrawing the case is not for Thookudurai. Its for us Its not like he was arrested Its like he arrested the station and kept it in this place Sign it! She came forward to sign The case is withdrawn Next she will fall at your feet and seek pardon Compulsory crying In that tears you will jump and play Where are you going? Where are you going? You said you will plead and now you are passing by If you don’t seek pardon, they will beat the pulp out of me If we don’t understand someone its not a mistake But if we misunderstand that’s a big mistake I have withdrawn the case I can’t plead and seek help from him You can't? Can you sum up this incident in one word in English? Unbelievable! Its like that English You don’t have 5 lakhs Break everything What are you doing? You are here? I was asking if you are here only! I was searching elsewhere Durai is here, come What’s this! Creating some confusion?
