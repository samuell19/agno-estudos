No, don't put me down! No. Hold on to me or they'll kill you. Now! Don't kill him! Assholes! No. We are checking your pressure. The problem is the next step. I'm sorry. That heart cost this institute seven million dollars! She knows how much it cost. She's been a part of this... since the first moment we got Kong's heartbeat restored. There is nothing wrong with the heart. The damn thing runs like a swiss watch. It's his blood. He's been comatose too long. His blood volume has deteriorated. We've been over this. There is simply no other species... ...whose plasma will transfuse with Kong's. But you told us a year ago... If the heart had been ready then, I could've operated without a transfusion. If we cut him open now, he'll die. Only one thing can save Kong. - What's that? - A miracle. Bitch, bitch, bitch... if it had been up to you candyasses... ...you'd still be down in Iquira. ...where they ain't seen a diamond in over 20 years. So quit your bitching and come on. What are you scared of? Come on. It's so hot out here, even the jaguars are sleeping. You want a little siesta? Okay. Oh, anything in there better scram... because Mitch is coming in for a snooze. And that includes you... Come here. Find your own bed. Holy shit! Easy, boy. Steady, big fella. Wait, don't! You'll kill him! It's Borneo. He's on the line. Mr. Mitchell, you will have to speak up, please... We're having trouble reading you. Hello... hello, can you hear me now? We can hear you now, Mr. Mitchell. Okay. Now, I am a business man, Dr. lngersoll. My staff is fielding offers, even as we speak. Mr. Mitchell, I realize that other universities... ...are interested in your specimen, but we have an extremely urgent need for plasma for a transfusion. I ain't selling blood, Doc. I'm selling the whole damn monkey. I realize that, and we can negotiate for him later. But right now, we've got to have him here as soon as possible. Wait, him? My ape ain't a 'him'; it's a 'her'. Mr. Mitchell, this is Dr. Hughes, chief of primate reasearch. Did you say that your beast is a female? Yeah. And a damn good-looking one too. No. we can not bring a female here. What are you talking about? Sir, we're not lancing a hemorrhoid here. We're replacing a heart. I'm well aware of that, Dr. Franklin. The slightest upset while Kong is recuperating-- Wait a minute, who is that? Doc, I'm warning you. I got Harvard on the other line. Get the blood and let someone else have the female. You are going to blow the score of the century. Amy, you're exaggerating the danger. Uhh, money talks, Doc. You're gonna be visiting my ape in Disneyland. We can advance you $10,000. Well, That ain't exactly filling my rice bowl. What if the operation fails? Then another university will have the only living ape. Mitchell, you've got yourself a deal. Thank You , Doctor. Yee-haw! Yeah, mama, this is it! My monkey is going to make me rich! Oh, oh, easy, girl. You're okay. I'm here. I'm here. I'll take care of you. Looks like you and me better get used to being famous. You better watch out there, buddy. I think that little lady's got a crush on you. Mr. Mitchell, Andrew lngersoll. Welcome. Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell. How did you get the ape from the jungle? I left a trail of bananas. Are you going to breed her? Uhh, you mean personally? Where did he get that hat? Camp Beverly Hills? I think he's cute. Ladies and gentlemen... This acquisition establishes beyond question. The scientific preeminence of Atlantic Instititue. Forget the institute, Professor. Bring on the ape! Mr. Mitchell. This is Dr. Franklin, the surgeon who will be operating on Kong. - Ah, the lady on the telephone. - Congratulations, Mr. Mitchell. - How soon is the operation? - Will the female give blood? We have a plasma center set up at the institute. Minutes count now. Cidado, permission. Just take it easy! You are dealing with a lady! Lady Kong? Lady Kong! Turn off those lights. Don't worry, folks. You are gonna get... ...what you want from Lady Kong. All of you... Valve open. Filter clear. I mean, you could've left her a couple pints. She looked like hell after all that blood you pumped out of her. Your female is resting fine, Mr. Mitchell. Yeah, in that crummy warehouse you stuck her in. Look, you're spending a fortune on Kong here. Why don't you spend a few bucks on my ape? Look we are building a permanent facility for her 10 miles from here. It'll be ready in just a couple weeks. What the hell is that for? History. Doctor, we can check it again, once we get out there. Okay, let's go to work. It's all yours. -Is the cardiac's output okay? -Yeah. Perfect. A bi-tip and a tri-tip suction That's good. Reduce the tension there a little bit. Suction, please. Increase suction. Little more. That's it. I got it. - The main clamp. - Full suction! Clamp all the bleeding. Both pumps. Full-volume. - Break in the system. - Franklin, institute! - Sutures. - Cross clamp. Above the vent. More suction. I got it. - Retract her. - Line's open. Clear way. There's room on the side. Suction out. This prestigious institute, longing rival... ...of Harvard and Yale. ...has suddenly found itself in the grip of a mad disease! Kong-Mania has invaded the... hallowed halls of academia. And the place has literally gone bananas! To house Lady Kong until her... ...permanent quarters can be completed, research chief Benson Hughes... ...has converted this warehouse... ...into the world's biggest lady's dressing room. We figure that Kong Island and Borneo... were both part of the same land mass... Hey, Doc, just a second. Excuse me, ladies. - Where is the Doctor? - Well, she is still with her patient. Three days? Man, does she get sleep? I believe her words were: "You don't need me. You've got Indiana Jones." Amy. Amy. Hello, Kong. Welcome back. You horny son of a bitch. He smells a female a mile away. - How many wires are still on him? - He's pulled out nine electrodes... Sedative IV is still in. Down... - Cardiac function? - Irregular. - Alpha readout? I'm getting aggressive EET activity. - Mike? - Blood pressure dropping. There are that sedation. Knock him out. What it turns out is that's their word for "mule". - Oh, there is your star. - Well, our boy's awake. - Outstanding. - And we're in trouble. What's happened? The female has to be moved now. - Kong scented her. - The quarters are a mile apart. Well, it's not enough. He can hear her too. So what? It'll give him something to get well for. I have nothing against you, Mr. Mitchell... You saw a way to make a quick buck. - Now, just a damn minute-- - Read the EKGs. We almost lost him. He was on his feet. He jumped for the overhead bars. He was trying to get to the female. We hit him with enough thorazine.. ...to kill a whale. We can't keep sedating him-- not with his heart. She's right. We gotta move her. But where? The new quarters aren't ready yet. Well, then make them ready! - How long will that take? - Two days if we work around the clock. The female will be out of there in 48 hours. Wait. I'll walk you to your car. Hey, you're not going back to Kong now, are you? - As a matter of fact, I am. - Take a break. You need rest as much as he does. Listen, I'm sorry about my tone in there. - I didn't realize... - Forget it. I'll drive you home... if you like... I just want to make sure that you get home. I'm not trying to hit on you. Thank You, Mr. Mitchell. I can navigate on my own. Look, if it means anything to you... I thought you were great in that operation. It does. Good night. Yeah, good night. Be careful with that. Keep it moving. Come on. Keep moving. There you go. Have her on that flatbed and out of here before dawn. Yes, sir, Mr. Ingersoll. There's too much going on in here. You're gonna spook her. Leave it to us, Mr. Mitchell. We know what we're doing. Easy, big guy. Hold on. Alright. Let's fence her in. Wait for the sedative to take effect. We should've used a tranquilizer gun. I'm not shooting her. The doped food's enough. Not if she doesn't eat it all. Get the slings onto her. K.S.C. to L.K. One. Shit! Chief. Cut her loose. Those things are tearing her to pieces. - Are you crazy! - We have to stop it. Stop this whole thing. She's right. Let's get it over with now. Chief, it's Mazlansky. The other monkey's gone apeshit. Chief. Chief. Dozers, take him down! Hit him in the knees! Ignorant bastard! We could've stopped him! Stopped him? You would've killed him! A task force, under the command of Colonel R. T. Nevitt. has sealed a 50 square mile area west of Quinoa Mountain. So far, the apes appear to be deliberately avoiding all areas of human habitation. We shall be back with any further development. Come on! Damn it, pull over! - Where do you think you're going? - The same place that you are. Oh, the hell you are! There is a battalion of infantry up in the hills. Now just exactly how far do you think you'd get? How far are you going to get in your Rent-A-Wreck? Get in. Here. Earn your keep. Okay, now, have-- have you talked... to this army character? What's his name? Colonel Nevitt. He says that he will shoot the first civilian that crosses his perimeter. Swell. Over here is the area the army's sealed off. Our apes are in there somewhere. Hold that perimeter on the west bank, ...then I'll get back to you. Over. - Do you have any report on those damn civilians? - I have seized the vehicle, sir. It's recently registered to one Dr. A.C. Franklin. She is the doctor that operated on Kong. We think that the man who is with her is that Mitchell character. They're going to need a doctor when they get a whiff of this gas... - Good morning, sir. - Gentlemen. Well, we should have no problem identifying the enemy. They're approximately 50 feet tall, and wearing their birthday suits. Now make sure that every man... has got a mask, and he's got it ready. Right side up. When choppers start dumping that gas... - ...I want the apes dropping, not us. - Yes, sir. Alright, let's go. Shit! If you have another gear on this thing, you better find it. Oh, Jesus! I used you and Borneo... If I wanted an early death. What's that thing? Your makeup kit? It's a cardiac monitoring unit for Kong's heart. It has 22 remote inputs linking to microprocessors in the implant. Oh great, let's go. If Kong's heart isn't right, this makeup kit'll fix it. Here, give me the bag. Yeah. You know that Kong crossed this thing in a single stride? I wish I were Kong. Just a second, okay. No! Get the case. Save it. Are you nuts? - Are you alright? - Yeah. - The cardiac unit. Where is it? - Over there. Come on. - Let me see your arm. - Jesus, how I did that? - Ah, don't worry about it. - Hang on. Alright, it's not too deep. I don't want it getting infected. I need you. You're the only one around for 10 miles who isn't playing John Wayne. Alright. There you go. Thanks, Doc. - My God, you must be freezing. - Yeah. Think I'll change. They're up there. Not very far. - Well... how's our boy doing? - Incredible. After all that exertion, his heart is actually stronger. God! Looks like you're losing your girlfriend. You know... they could survive here. Or Borneo... or Kong Island. All that it'd take is money for a reserve. Well, we should find us some place to camp. Hey, this looks good. Hey, it worked for Kong. Are you sure about this? We're primates too. He's gone. - She's down there alone. - What? Kong, he's gone. Standby for the Colonel. Okay, bring in the big bird! Get those nets around her! Make sure she's secure! Okay, chopper. Take him out! Concussion grenade! Hold him back till we get her out of here! - Spread out! - Let's go get him! Tell him to land beyond that peak. - We'll pin the ape at the top. - Yes, sir. We got the noose on him, boys. He's ours now. Wait. Sir, the wind is down to 40 knots. Down the choppers before we lose one. All units, this is Colonel Nevitt. Kill that hairy son of a bitch now! Move out! - Come on, let's go. - Halt! Hold it right there, buddy. We caught the civilians, sir. - You! - You got him cornered. You don't have to finish him off. He's not your problem anymore, pal. He's mine. - Standby to fire. - No! Not even your Kong can survive that. Alright, open it up. I don't know why they keep dumping that shit. She don't touch none of it. Why don't you go in there and... clean it up? Yeah. Next week. Ben. Signed by the Secretary of Defense himself. - Oh, thank God. - Colonel Nevitt can't keep us out now. Let's get a move on. God knows what shape she's in. - Still nothing from Mitch? - He's in Bornea... ...somewhere in the back or beyond. You know Mitch, we won't hear from him till he's succeeded. Pray he does. It'll make all the difference. Your priceless research specimen... Is the reason two of my men damn near bought the farm. It's the reason 104 other soldiers... ...are stuck here playing 'jailor' instead of training. Let me be a little more blunt. It's the reason my ass has been stuck in this rathole since last summer. Well, you won't get unstuck, Colonel, by disobeying orders. You know, the army has perfectly capable physicians, Dr. Franklin. They check your monkey every two weeks. - I'm going in. - No one goes in there. How long has she been acting like this? Three months, four-- who the hell knows? She's fine. Is that your diagnosis, Colonel? What the hell is that monkey crying for? I'll tell you why. For Kong. - The female's grieving. - No. She feels something. Kong's alive. - Don't be ridiculous. - I feel it too. Okay I've wasted enough time. Sergeant! Give these people two minutes with their gorilla, then clear 'em out. Visiting hours are over, ma'am. Permanently. I know Kong's alive. The army covered every inch of the state. They found nothing. That's right. No corpse. Come on, Ben. It was you who told us that... some primate species mate for life, - ...then the male returns? - Not if he's dead. We're talking about a creature with a protein requirement... In excess of a thousand pounds per day. Face the truth, Amy. An organism the size of Kong... separated from his natural environment or from captivity... ...he just couldn't acquire sufficient protein. Hello, stranger. Well, when Mitch says he'll deliver... ...ten thousand acres of Borneo highland... and it's only gonna cost Atlantic lnstitute $1.3 million. Hey, you're not jealous of my other girlfriend, are you? Come on, I haven't seen her for months. Neither has anyone else. - What are you talking about? - You're holding her underground. Nevitt left us in once, then he locked the base down tight. - What? - Something's wrong with her. She won't eat or sleep. I think she's dying. - We can't get in, Mitch. - We'll see about that shit. Don't tell me that Nevitt is unavailable... ...because Nevitt has been un-goddamn-available for the last 4 hours! - Sir, if you submit your request through channels - - Channels, my ass! - Hey! - Mitch! Mitch! Stop him! If your friend wants another, I'll be glad to oblige. - Take it easy, partner. - Mitch. We've got the preserve now. We can fight Nevitt. For God's sake, you haven't slept in 24 hours. Let's go home. Come on. Relax. Bedroom eyes. That's what you have. Just about the biggest, brownest eyes... ...I've ever did see. Don't stop now. I like your sweet talk. Come on! Come on! Let's get out of here! David! David! It's Kong! Oh my God! Oh my God! Come on! Come on baby. you're going to love this. Now hold on tight and close your eyes. Yaa-hoo! And here is our latest update... The huge gorilla is believed to be heading north to rejoin his mate. Overnight, this peaceful resort has become the friendly rednevous... of every hunter from miles around. What the hell is this? Deliverance? You there! Are those weapons loaded? You bet, General! And so are we! You'd be shooting each other, you damn fool! You wanna get killed? I want that ape's head on the hood of my pickup! We got company. Down there. That's gotta be our boy. I thought you said you could fly this thing. My guess is we're ahead of them by a couple miles. We gotta hump it. - You damn chigger! - Shut up. You hear something? Jesus, God, look at the size of him. Vance, I think I gotta go to church. - Oh, look at the size of that thing! - Oh, give me that! Hey, hey. Get over here and take my picture. Alright, smile now! One more! Let's get one more. - Boy, get him some Juicy Fruit. - Get him a drink! Yes, yes! Give him a drink! Alright. Whoa!! Hey, now that's some good liquor, son! I tell you what, I don't like this boy's attitude. Yeah, we gotta teach him some respect. That's enough, Will. Leave the damn animal alone. Oh Miss Johnstone. You getting squeamish, honey? You gonna kill him, kill him, but don't torment the poor son of a bitch. Oh, we ain't going to torment him, Jay. We're just going to brown him a little bit. Damn it, Fitz, I said stop. Well Jay, you getting out of hand, son. Now, we gone teach you some manners... ...you big ugly sum bitch. What the hell? Go, go, go! Get the hell away! That's right, Kong. Come this way. Are you crazy? How close do you have to be with this thing? His heart's crippled. I have to correct it. I couldn't complete the sequence. His heart won't last a day. Well, he doesn't seem to know that. Come on. My God. They're hunters. They must've dynamited him from up there. My God, you would've been half-buried. Then they had their fun with him. Well, Kong, you've killed now. Nothing will stop them from killing you. No, there is one thing. We gotta move. Come on. Alright! Let's go!! All units, pull out! Sir, air recon confirms. Enemy's headed straight this way. - Range? - Eleven miles. Sir, General Sutton's on the horn from D.C.. He's still ordering a capture. No kill. What channel did you try to reach me on? Alpha, sir. Well, that channel is malfunctioning, Major. Yes, sir! Damn it. Mitch. The army is reporting the ape's position. General Sutton clearly favors a capture and not a kill. The units under Colonel Nevitt have left their headquarters to block the male gorilla... ...and divert him to where he can be apprehended. Whoa! Get outta here! Oh, no! My dad is going to kill me! Alright, listen up, you men. Colonel's orders. Go to your units on the tank range. On the double! Yes, Sergeant! They're waiting for him. They'll cut him to pieces. Lady Kong's silo. There's no way we're gonna get in there. No, I think we can. It's gonna be dark soon. Fire! Hold your positions! You! Get back here now! Yes, sir! Move it! Go!! You son of a bitch!! Hold it! Hold it! Follow me! Hey there! Wait a minute! Where the hell are you going, man? Get back in here. Just got a call from the captain. You can't leave just two soldiers. - Captain White called us to... - I don't care what the captain said. Colonel Nevitt said there can't be... ...more than two here. - When did Colonel Nevitt say that? You got an entire battalion out there. Damn. You, halt! Yeah, Level 5. Right. Right. Get off your ass. Break-in. - What the hell's going on? - Break-in! - Oh, I'm sorry. I-- - Hello, mama. Oh my God! What have they done to her? They haven't done anything. She's pregnant. Here. It's gonna be okay, girl. We're gonna get you out of here. It's gonna be all right. Take it easy, girl. - No, girl. No, no. - Careful, Mitch! No! No, girl. No, no, no. Mitch! - No, no! - Mitch! Is that you, Elroy? I ain't seen you in a hundred years, boy. You don't never know who's gonna show up... ...at one of these here family reunions, do you? Ain't that a natural? How about a little something to wet your whistle, huh? - Fire! - No! You'll hit the female! - She's in labor! - I said fire, damn it! Take him out! Soldiers! Come on, you bastard. Come on! Oh my God. Show him. Show him his son. He's there, Kong. Can you reach him? Reach for him, Kong. Reach for him.
