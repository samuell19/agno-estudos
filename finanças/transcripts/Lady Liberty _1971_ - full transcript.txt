Excuse me, you must go to your seats and put on your seat belts. We're about to land. Sorry, we're about to land. THE MORTADELLA AKA LADY LIBERTY You smell that? What were they smoking? I'd better tell Bob right away. Miss, excuse me. We're in New York. What? Oh, what a pity. I wanted to see it from the air. We didn't want to wake you. You slept so soundly. I was so sleepy. Would you believe I haven't slept so well in 4 years? I thinks it's happiness which has this effect. I'm getting married! Cheers! - Thanks. Congratulations. Maddalena! OK, you may go. Miss? Please. - Yes. She didn't come. She didn't! - There she is, idiot! My congratulations! - It's me! What a nice frame! Look! A gift from my co-workers! All of them! He can't hear you. - No? The glass is sound-proof. He's my fiance. - Miss, anything to declare? Oh, yes: I am… I am very happy to be in your country. What's inside? - Nothing. A wedding present from our co-workers. I'm marrying him. See the handsome, dark, young man up there? The one with the little flags? - Hello there. What present did they give you? It's not a bomb, is it? Please, it's mortadella. Pork meat, very tasty. Then I was right to say it was a bomb. You can't bring meat in. No! Mortadella is a kind of sausage. I'm not sure how you say it. It's not in the dictionary. Like salami but way better, you see, more delicate. Yes, but you can't bring meat into our country. It could be made from diseased animals, and worse than any bomb. Miss, I better take it. - Diseased? You mean sick? Sick? This is the highest quality! Made with the best pigs in Italy, especially for us. I don't know about pigs, but the law says you can't! How dare you? Michele! Come here! Get down! As I must inform you, the law forbids bringing any meat into our country! - Please, gimme me a break! Hey, get back here! Bill! Stop her, Bill! One moment, Miss. What's the problem? What problem? He's crazy! He says there's a law against my wedding present. Ain't that nuts? Please behave. - OK, I'll talk to you. It's for the best. - Goddamn… This one's obsessed with bombs. - What's the matter, Tim? That package has pork. It does? Wait, let's call Dominic. Hello? Dominic? - Crazy. Don't get smart with me, Miss. Who said anything? No? Just watch it. You think I'm dumb? - No! Dominic's coming now. Well then, boys? - Chief. Miss, you're surely aware of our laws regarding narcotics? Even through Italy, drug dealers have ways to get drugs to our country. You may be unwittingly carrying drugs. Huh? Was the pig on drugs? It's salami, not drugs, Chief. Sorry, my colleague wasn't clear. It'd be better to talk more calmly. Would you mind coming with me? But Michele is waiting. We haven't seen each other for a century. A century? Then he must be impatient to see you. And I'm not? Is here fine? - Yeah. Now then, my name's Dominic. And you? - Maddalena. A beautiful name. I like it. Thanks, me too. You see, I work for customs and I want to explain the situation. OK? - OK. The fact is that US law prohibits the importation of pork products of any kind. The reason is that we must be very careful not to let in a disease called swine flu. These pigs never even had a cold. Right. I don't doubt it, but… the law makes no exceptions, unfortunately. I'm afraid it must be burned. - But it's just mortadella! Why don't you burn me too? I could be diseased too. It's excellent meat! And I can guarantee it because my co-workers made one especially for me and Michele. He loves it. This is my wedding gift and you want to take it away? I thought this was a free country. Some freedom! Magdalena… - Michele would never forgive me if I didn't fight such a stupid law! He's a real man. You don't know him. He made me a real woman. And I'm infinitely grateful. I want my Michele! Where is he? Here, drink this. - Oh, no. It might be diseased. Magdalena… Maddalena with two "ds," no "g!" OK, OK, OK. You're one smart lady, Maddalena without a "g." Do you know you remind me of mother? When she makes up her mind, that's it. And Mom's usually right. What can I tell you, maybe you are right, but the Law must be respected. Why make such a fuss over salami anyway? Mortadella. And I'm not the one who's making a fuss. What's the matter? Is America afraid of mortadella? Fine. What's your fiance's name? Michele Bruni. OK. Yes? Yes. OK, certainly. Certainly, OK! Fine. Your friend, Mr Bruni, will soon be here. We had him paged. Mr Bruni is not my friend. He's my future husband. As you wish. Your future husband. Fine. Do you mind if I smoke? - I do. Michele! Maddalena! Watch out! Michele… Let's put this aside. - No, please! If you do, they might burn it. And the beard, where is it? - I cut it off. I could think of nothing but you all these years. Do I look a fright? - No! Well, the trip and these guys were getting on my nerves. But you're finally here. Maddalena. We're putting on a show. Wait here. Sorry, what is this about? - Uh, the young lady… They wouldn't let me in because of the mortadella. Have you ever seen anything so dumb? Please don't use certain words, you could get in trouble. You see there's a law… - A stupid law! Because this was made by Cerri and his team with top quality material! I'm so sorry. Miss Ciarrapico doesn't know what she's saying. She must be a bit tired. - I know what I'm saying. Such a stupid thing was never seen, not even in Italy, which is saying much. - Maddalena, control yourself. I'm perfectly in control. Maddalena, the law is the law. And don't argue. Michele, what are you saying? In Italy, you fought always against unjust laws. You'd go into the square to demonstrate. You weren't afraid then. I didn't go to the square for a mortadella, that's for sure. Stop, you're making us look ridiculous! The law's ridiculous! Ridiculous and stupid! We're not deaf, Miss! That's enough! He's right! And I'm ashamed of you! You have no right to say that. I act this way because you taught me to. I fought side by side with this man. Up until then, in Italy, there was no divorce. Maddalena... - He was married! A mistake that could happen to anybody. We fell in love. We went through hell. The entire world was against us. Relatives, neighbors, the law, the church, even our bosses. "Fight! Fight!", he said, "Never give into injustice!" I caught pneumonia during a demonstration for divorce He said we must fight to the death for the proletariat. What the hell are you saying? It was me who convinced him to come to America, where we could be free. I waited for him to call me. Four years! Four long years of solitude and humiliation. Want to dance? - No, thank you. But I was ready to wait ten, even one hundred years. Because he taught me never to give up. Look at him now: He's become a puppet. Dressed like a little lord. But then, Michele was different. You should've seen him marching with the red flag before all. Not true! She's a liar. Maddalena, please, stop acting like an idiot. I pity you. Stop acting like an idiot! Stop acting like a fool. You're embarrassing me. This isn't Italy. You should be grateful to be in the most civilized country in the world. See if you can be a bit… less Italian, OK? What are you then? Chinese? I may be Italian but you're a coward. A buffoon. What does that mean? - Oh, don't you know? Puppet. Apologize for what you said. All this because of 7 kgs of mortadella! Get your hands off her! It's not her fault as you know darn well! She's a good and honest mortadella! And she has no diseases, even if they don't believe it. He's the one, I don't recognize anymore. He was a serious person, now you can't trust him. He turns against his friends: good and honest people! Who aren't ashamed to be what they are. Well, I won't give up my mortadella. Either she comes with me, or I never enter America! Because that would mean this is not a free country! Magnificent, Miss! Stupendous. The most beautiful thing I've heard in years. Shut up, Fenner, nobody asked you. Inspector Nolan, Minister of Agriculture. Maddalena Ciarrapico. Isn't this business getting a little out of hand when it's just a lousy sausage? Wrong, man. That sausage is a symbol of all that yesterday, as everywhere in the world, represents injustice and repression and all which our marvelous ancestors taught us to defend! I mean fight. - Shut up, Fenner. I'm willing to overlook what you said before, Maddalena. I think you should apologize to these people for wasting their time and then we can leave. I said let's go. That's the way, babe, don't let them push you around! You stay out of this. Maddalena, you know me. I thought I knew you, but it's obvious you've changed. I won't ask you again. Miss, I've nothing against you, but my job is to stop the spread of disease from your country to mine. The law is the law. - Don't listen, Maddalena! We'll make demonstrations, strikes, raising our cry of protest all the way up! We'll make it a matter of principle and change this stupid law. Hand in hand, we'll march undauntedly to the Supreme Court. I can guarantee public opinion will be on your side. OK? I'm Jack Fenner. - Get out of here! Get him out of here! Get out! Throw him out! - …NY Daily News! Sent by God to help you! Hey, police brutality! You're a witness, Maddalena! They take every opportunity to stifle the freedom of press! Now then, let's go. Maddalena, I'm not asking again. You already said that. I don't want to hear it anymore. Just go away. Go away and leave me alone! You realize what you're saying? - Yes. I realize I don't know you anymore. I don't ever want to see you again while I live. Now… go away. Get out of here! Come on, Maddalena, don't. I'm sorry. Wait, I'll find him and bring him back. No, no, no. I want to wash my face. Is that allowed in this free country? Sure, come. - Thank God. My bag. Where is it? - That way. Hey, you! Where do you think you're going? If you gotta go, you gotta go! Sit down! - Is everybody crazy here? It's against the law to pee? Emma! Emma! Nice move. Thanks. - You're welcome. What did they nab you for? - It's a long story. For me, it's the second time. What's that? Oregano? Why did they nab you? Well, for the mortadella. I never tried that. Do you inject, smoke or drink it? What is it? No, it's a kind of… sausage. Made in my country, Italy. It couldn't hurt a fly but they acted like it was a bomb. I was very happy to come to America, but now… Smoking, eh? So what? Sure, she was. Outside! Let's go! Damn snitch! Maddalena! Brace yourself, great news! I spoke to Martin Siegel of the Civil Liberties Union. I explained the whole thing and he was very interested! You know what that means for us? - Young man, get out now! You've no right to be in here! Cool it, grandma, we're here to defend the rights of man! Man tramples on more important rights than the exclusivity of the toilet! So, I ask you to mind your business and I'll mind mine. Come on, let's go, Maddalena. Cia-rr-a-pico. Ciarrapico. Place of birth? Where were you born? - Trevico, near Naples. Naples? That's good. Naples… What's your fiance's name? You mean "ex-fiancé". Yeah, that ugly thing. His name? His name was Michele Bruni. Michele… - Bruni. Bruni. Good. Say, Maddalena, were you shocked over what happened when you set foot on American soil? Yes… Do you feel the American government is abusing its power? Yes. Does this antiquated, absurd, racist law frighten you? No. And why not? Because it disgusts you, eh? So, Maddalena, are you ready to go all the way? Are you ready to fight to the death? To death… In other words, can I count on you? Yeah. - Great, then consider it done. Smooth sailing. Now, I'll go call the paper to dictate the story to them, OK? So, don't worry because I'll be right back, OK? Stay here and wait for me calmly. Hey, buy today's Daily News. In a few years, it'll be a collector's item. It'll be worth a fortune, my man! Lend me a dime for the phone. Well, I don't have a dime. In Milan, they only gave me… only bills. - Well, that's alright. Now, I'll get change. Don't worry, Maddalena, I'll be right back with it. Watch your purse. Tired? So many things have happened. My head is spinning, I feel… confused. - Yes, I understand. Fenner confuses anyone. No, he was the only one who stood up for me. OK, let's go. My feet… The whole thing is off. Don't say another word, it's over! There's no dinner because there's no marriage, betrothal. There's nothing whatsoever! Got it? Jesus! Did something bad happen? Yes. Maddalena happened. She wants to ruin me. She says I'm a communist! Mamma mia! A communist! There's an asshole journalist who's encouraging her… Yes. An asshole. I heard you, an asshole. But what about the guests? Tell them my plane was hijacked to Cuba, anything, but don't make me look like an idiot please. Be nice to the judge, give him all the champagne he wants. Got it, damn it? Asshole. Why does he keep calling me an "asshole"? No. There's absolutely no way to convince her. We've tried everything. Yes. He's right here. OK. He wants to talk to you. Yeah, this is Nolan. No, stubborn like a mule. Yes, alright. But there's no precedent as far as I know. Yes. Yes, alright. He says put her on the first plane to Italy with the salami. Mortadella. That's great. Who has the first flight? Alitalia? I think so. - It makes perfect sense. But who'll pay for her ticket? We are not. We wouldn't even dream of it. So much the better. He said call the Italian Consulate. Too late. It's closed now. You'll need a vice-consulate, at minimum, to authorize this. There's just one thing: I don't want to return to Italy. I don't give a damn what you want! You'll do what we want! This is our law and everybody must respect it! And that goes for you and your damn salami! Mortadella. - Thanks. Whose side are you on? - I want a lawyer. I will go to the Supreme Court. That will take months. Out of the question. Listen, Miss Ciarrapico, let's take things one at a time: If you insist on this business, you'll have to spend the night here. And not in a comfy bed, be sure of that. Don't be swayed by that clown of a reporter. He hunts for scandals and feeds off of them. Ah, no, it's you who want to sway her! That's why I eavesdrop, it's part of my job! Don't let them trick you. They can't lay a glove on you. Because they know I'd crucify them. We got the Daily News behind us. My typewriter's like a machine-gun and it never misses! Beat it! This woman is acting from the awesome logic of a pure heart. The law's wrong and she wants it changed. What's wrong with that? Why deny entry to a mortadella, when we admit the human body full of carcinogenic germs? This woman isn't only trying to bring a sausage into the US. She's aiming much higher! She is challenging the giant with feet of clay! What do we have that's hot for today? Two pieces: a hijacking and a sex maniac. No, no, this is better. A bit wordy but it's fresh. Trash the others. Run this. Page three, 3 columns, clearly visible. THE BANNED MORTADELLA Fantastic! A nice headline in bold italics over 3 columns. Hey, Stan! Did you see this? A big hit, eh? The boss went crazy over it. I've talked Fred Mancuso into taking up this girl's cause. He's coming out to the airport in the morning. They'll finally know Jack Fenner's name! It's about time, I'll be damned! You want something to eat? No. Is something wrong? Are you thirsty? Would you like a Coke? OK. A nice tape recorder. I got one like this too. Japanese, eh? Italian songs? No. I sing something. Listen, I have a radio if you want to hear some music. Or maybe you prefer to sleep. You're very tired. You must be tired too. You must forgive me. Yes, because… It must be my fault if you're not home with your family. Oh, no, I'm not married. Anyway, don't worry. I have night duty this weekend. I thought everybody in America married young. Which means I haven't found the right girl yet. Besides, I must take care of my mother. She's a great cook, you know? Her eggplant parmesan is like nothing else in the world. It's her own special recipe. She uses 3 kinds of cheese, mixes them all together, and puts it in the oven and when it gets brown… - A knife? What? - Do you have a knife? Yes, of course. I'm an old boy scout! 14 blades, it does it all. - Thanks. There we go… Would you like to taste it? The forbidden fruit. I'm almost afraid to. Hey, this is delicious! Very delicate. - That's what I've been saying. You're doing this to teach your fiancé a lesson, right? Because he didn't stick up for you? - That's not why. When you called Michele, I was already in the customs chief's office. So you used to work in a factory where they make mortadella? 4 years. And the day that I left, all my co-workers… Oh, right, that was just yesterday. Thinking about it feels like a century ago. It was just yesterday. I know what you mean. I've never been to Europe but… tons of people say it has that effect. It's the time difference. You lose your sense of time. Perhaps. You know, after all the years, that I was alone, always thinking about him, waiting to be able to come here, doing nothing but wait, there's always been a sense of… of the momentary. Of… Of something coming… - Temporariness. God, I'm so tired, I can't even explain… You explain it very well. - Thanks. But how did you learn our language so well? Well, I took correspondence classes and then… I made do with that and those records. I used to have conversations with a… a co-worker who had been in America. And she always wanted to record everything. Because by listening again, I could… correct myself. And I sang. I invented songs. I like to sing. I kept the recordings so Michele could listen, so we could laugh over them together. But I've no need for them anymore. Can I listen to it? My name is Maddalena, Maddalena Ciarrapico. - Hey, it's a real song! I work in Zola, but I'm from Trevico And I moved north out of necessity. I forgot to erase that part. I moved north, so many years ago. Beautiful town of mine, not far from Naples. My Trevico, you're still, you're still my first love. There the sea was blue, I will never forget. 'Cause I live in Zola, where there is smog. I work in the food sector where I make mortadella from pork. Who would have guessed that I would find here my own love, that is, the man I love. He was handsome, he was proud, one who didn't shit himself from fear. He did not do it on, or upon or close to himself. But cruel fate revealed that he was a married man. He was a married man. His demon eyes tempted me both body and soul. Body and soul! The fear of sin redoubled, redoubled my desire. Desire. But wherever I went, he followed behind me with his red '500. Red? More like lobster '500. He followed me like a shadow, with those eyes burning with fever. What do you want from me? Why do you bother me? He let me down. Let me be. You're not free… to love. He looked for me everywhere, he followed me, the stubborn fool. My heart in the long run began to undertake to waver. I begin to undertake, you undertake, he, she undertakes To waver. Then one day, one day I've never forgotten. On March 4th of a leap year, we decided to meet in a beautiful meadow. It was there that I listened to what he had to say. And never, never, never would I have abandoned him. And never, never, never would I have abandoned him. He spoke of his torment. I found out that I loved him… I smell something. What is it? It's a kind of sausage. It's called mortadella. It smells good. Want to try some? - Why not? May I? - OK. Check this stuff out. Let's put an end to this. Hey, ya know it's really good? Tasty. Have you read this morning's paper, O'Henry? You read about the mortadella? - Yes, I read it, Sir. "We don't have the pleasure to talk about sausages often…" There's more. "We can only bow our heads and blush for shame for not allowing this wonderful young lady into our country. And at a time when our relations with Western European countries have been at their lowest, never seen in history. And above all, for reasons bureaucratic, petty and hollow, which our unqualified customs officials and the Minister of Agriculture have imposed." O'Henry, how could you let a thing like this happen? No, we can't find her. This is the "Everyday" from Norfolk, Virginia talking. Whom do we need to ask to interview Maddalena Ciarrapico? I'm telling you there's a bomb in the mortadella. Beware! I can't find a definition of mortadella in the dictionary. Is mortadella on the market? We could buy some shares. Find out what they're saying and get back to me. Is it true that it's not pork meat but donkey? This should be all: press release, biography on Mancuso, voting record, his career in domestic policy… Press kits? Drinks for the press? - Check. Security clearance? - Yeah, I talked to him. You copy me? Perfect, we're ready! Come on, boys! Here they come. Ready! Turn on the lights! Tell that moron to get out of the way! Get out! We're wasting time! Are you touching my car? - Hurry! All right, I'm going. Calm down. - Hurry, get out! Move it! Good to see you, guys. Thank you all for coming. Wait a minute, Mr Mancuso. - Hey wait, I'm on my way! Mr Mancuso, look over here! Please, Mr Mancuso, smile! This way, thanks! - Sorry, Martin. You all know Martin Siegel? A well-known civil rights' advocate. I asked him to help with his legal expertise. - Hi, Fred! How are you, Councilor? Remember me? Jack Fenner. A pleasure. Hey, Jack, come here. We can take it from here. Mr Mancuso, the fact that your electorate is made up of 50% of Italian-Americans wouldn't have anything to do with your interest in this case? It's time to leave behind these racist anachronisms. It's real progress we want. We must abolish the old laws. To fight for freedom. It's time to open the windows wide and let in new ideas. Isn't this about salami? Get his name. Hey, move that car from here. Why do we have parking places? Cool it, man, I'm with the congressman. Don't give me any lip. Move that car. Well, where's the girl? - In the toilet. Follow me. From the top! - Don't get in the way! Move away from the door! Damn, what a hottie! That's off the record. Fred, this is Maddalena Ciarrapico. Maddalena, this is Fred Mancuso. - Hello. And Martin Siegel of the ACLU. - Hello. Years ago, Fred singlehandedly led the fight to lift the ban on imported cheeses. Now we can import any type of cheese: parmesan, mozzarella, gorgonzola… You can open a deli. - Wait, I'm not finished. OK? Are you ready? - Lights! How do I look? You look fine, Mr Mancuso, but the background isn't very becoming. He's right! Absolutely! We'll move it all down by the windows here. C'mon! Over here, boys! Please, folks, clear this area! Hurry! Thank you, thank you. Up here. Fred, get up. Martin! You too. There we go. Lights. Roll 'em! Miss Ciarrapico, as an American of Italian descent, it is a duty… - I'm Mike Gallagher of M.F. Gallagher! Beef and pork sausages! We make the best salami in America! And with you on our team, we'll make the best mortadella! Come work with us! What did I tell you? America's at your feet! First the press, then government and now industry! Public opinion is starting to move! They're taking it to the streets! Will you clear off? Lights! Roll 'em! Miss Ciarrapico, as an American of Italian descent, it is a duty as well as a pleasure to welcome you to the United States of America… No worries, it got unplugged. Keep going. - Lights! Roll 'em! Miss Ciarrapico, - Stop! What? - One moment. Where's the sausage? - What? That's right! Maddalena, where's the mortadella? Right! I forgot. - We can't shoot without the mortadella! Where did I put the mortadella? Here it is. What's that? - The mortadella. Can't you see the mortadella? Want to try some? Excuse me, where's the rest? - What do you mean? Hey, what did you do with the mortadella? Are you trying to be a wiseguy? Hey! Hey, I… I ate it. You ate it? - Yes, I was hungry. Besides, I didn't eat it all by myself. The others had some too. What are you trying to do? Ruin me? But what difference does a few kilos or a few grams? It's the principle that counts. Here. Ah, right… It's the principle that counts. I think we need legal opinion. Councilor, what do you advise? Put it on a piece of bread with some mustard and pickles. Sorry, guys, better luck next time. Hey, no! Fred, wait a moment! Put him back on the shit list. Why is everybody leaving? What happened? What happened? Oh, nothing happened! What happened is that you're free to enter the USA, that's all. Now you can go through customs. You should be happy, right? What happened is that your fight, your story, my articles are over! And I'm finished together with your damn sausage! Where are you going! - Hey, Fred! Fred! Fred! Listen! Wait a moment! Who is this jerk? Let go, asshole! Somebody get this pain in the ass away from me immediately! Wait, Fred! It was a plot got up by the police to ruin me! I'll ruin you, you son of a bitch! Get away from me! Get away from the door! - Get moving! Move on. What manners! "Maddalena here, Maddalena there! My typewriter's a machine-gun! America's at your feet!" And you left me alone like an idiot! Is the end of the mortadella the end of the world? No, Mr "Jock", that's too easy! And I'm not some old shoe, you can get rid of, got it? Because of you, I blew my life away! And you leave me alone? Well, you won't treat me that way! You're taking me with you! Maddalena! But I'm here! I'm not abandoning you, my car is parked there! Come with me! You got any change? - Change? Change. I only have… - You know I don't have it. OK, take this. - That'll do. I'll give you the change later. C'mon. Hey! Wait, don't run! - Come on! Hi. How are you, Jack? - Great. It's all over. What do you mean? She's gone. They let her go. And the mortadella? Don't give me any of that crap, Perlino. You know damn well you'll get a nice promotion because of that midnight snack of yours! But where did she go? How the hell should I know? That reporter clown took her away. A fine job, Dominic. Brilliant! - Thank you, Sir. Where does your fiancé live? I'll take you there. - No. What will you do? Return to Italy? - No. Then, lady, suppose you tell me where you want me to take you. No! Want to come to my place? No! - No! Right. I don't know why I'm being so nice. I should hit you on the head, set you on fire, throw you out. - Let me out! Love to, but I can't stop on a bridge. I want to get out! Are you crazy? - I want to get out! Calm down! - I said stop! Why? Want to jump off the bridge? I'm sure you like that. This way, you can write a nice article for the papers. That kind of thing isn't news in NY. Let me out. I'll find a place to go. Where could you go? Tonight, you're staying with me at my place. Maybe, I can make amends. - A few hard slaps for starters. Never mind that. Can you tell me how you let that nasty customs inspector con you? A customs inspector! I don't get it. How was it possible? Come, tell me, what did he do? Drug you? Did he manage to seduce you? Were you drunk? What did he do? He didn't do anything. Come, tell the truth, what are you afraid of? It was all my fault. Mr Dominic was very kind to me. I was so down that I began to tell him my life's story. All the years I've waited. Loving a man who… who… Are you crying? Over such nonsense? Hey! You think only you have troubles? I'm a born loser. Everytime things are going well for me - BOOM - the axe falls! Things are good just enough to let me see that they are bad. Give me some change, OK? - Uh, huh. Didn't you see that lady wanted to park here? Sure, of course I did. I beat her to it by sprinting. But she was old. I bet you she's a drug dealer. Let's go. SHIT! Congratulations! Now you'll be lucky. And how is that? This brings luck. In Italy, it's always a good sign. Really? - Yes, from now on, things will go great for you. It's about time I had some luck. Thanks! Don't thank me, thank the dog. Third notice… Second notice… Last notice? I get nothing but notices. Nobody ever writes me a letter. Hey! This time, they stole my tape recorder! I don't know how they do it. It boggles my mind. You can't just take a door off its hinges without opening it first. It's impossible! I'd really like to know the one who did it! He's a genius! One… Let's go. You see? Let's open this other one… Christ, I forgot all about it. Where can we go now? I don't know but I'll stay where I am. Hey, Al, one moment, this is something special. Hey, hi "Something Special." - Hi. Too bad, Jack, my girl doesn't do "mixed doubles." Who the hell asked her anyway? Well, at least take this, OK? It's my home. And try to hurry up, OK? How long are you going to be? - I don't know. It depends. You got 1 hour, not 1 second more, OK? - You better call first. By the way, your old lady came by and she was bugging. She said it's your day to watch the kids. Since I owe him money, I can't say no when he asks to use my place to bring women. Shit! Speaking of that, didn't you say it would bring me luck? Be patient, it takes time for it to work, eh? "She is challenging the giant with the feet of clay." We need to teach him a lesson. That he won't forget too soon. He just didn't offend you, Michele, he offended all the Italians living in America: Lo Manzo, Procaccino, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Connie Francis… Knock it off! Stop talking shit. That man must know who Michele Bruni is. First and foremost. Call Frankie Panato. What do you mean Mr Cogan is not in? But I recognize your voice, you big fairy! Wait a… Guy owes me 7 bucks and changes his voice to tell me he's not in! Two coffees, please. Do you know what they paid me for covering the airport? Nothing at all! Want an espresso? - Yes, thanks. One regular and one espresso. And you know the taxes I pay for this nothing? Housing tax, NY State tax, Social security tax, pension tax, health care tax! This espresso makes you feel homesick, eh? The loan sharks are the worst of all. They'd walk over their mothers for a few bucks. Yeah. This is good. Really? Of course, it's sausage. So I've delegated a loan shark to manage my wages. The only way I can survive is to pit them against each other. This way they waste their energy fighting over the first bite. Hey, there's Wildflower. Here's somebody you should meet. Hey, there, you old goat! - Hey! Hey! - Hi, loser! I see finally you managed to get a few lines in the papers. Ah, you're the stubborn and fighting Italian girl. You came gliding down the blue American sky with that super sausage held tightly to your chest, given to you by Mother Nature. You're even better in person. But I can even make you better than Nature. A great body, Jack. My compliments. All curves from head to toe. Oh, yes, sister… When can she stop by to work, Jack? Wildflower is famous for his unusual pictures. And for churches. I've been staked out here for 10 days to shoot this. 10 days to take a photo? - Of course. If it's necessary. Because, you see, one must wait for the right time, the ideal instant, in which the subject is… as if it were suspended in time. I'd love to do your picture. There: this is one of my favorites. Both the portrait and the young lady. Who's this? Somebody new? That's… that's Dorothy O'Kelly. The senator's daughter. - Ah, right. For me, everything is here. Religion and sex! The two poles of the terrestrial axis. Great intuition, don't you think? He succeeds in showing a person's real essence, soul. Just by photographing one's ass. He's one of the most original American artists! A self portrait. Why am I so hung up for cash in what's supposed to be a credit economy? That's what you're asking yourself. And you're right. 1000s of people every day spend only a few bucks on a cab and get by on a bunch of credit cards. But if I apply for one, I get refused right away. Do you know what the rule is? The basic irony of the whole system? You can only get credit, if you prove you don't need it. Oh, good God. It's the loan sharks. Are you Jack Fenner from the Daily News? Yes, I was just coming to your office. Indeed… Mamma mia! - Wait! How much do I owe? Lowlifes! What are you doing? Hey, Frank, this way! Hey! Another one? That's good enough! Let's go! Mr "Jock"? Shit's luck! A cracked rib. Nothing serious. - It was that kick. It hurts to breathe. - Then don't breathe. Give him a sedative. We'll hold him here. - Hey! You just want to keep me here overnight so you can send me a bill. I didn't ask for anything! What an honor. - The honor is mine. I've been expecting you. - Really? Then you were sure I would come? Of course I was sure. Would you like something to eat? We can sit at a table or, if you prefer, we can go to my home. No, let's stay here. It's best. I'd prefer everybody to see and hear us. Can I have that spaghetti, please? - It's for another table. They can wait. - Alright. A lady's wish comes before everything else. This wave of nostalgia just came over you, I see. Right. I don't know why but I felt an urge for spaghetti. Have a seat. Thank you but I prefer to stand up! I do things with my own hands, as you can see! And not send others! Maddalena! Shitface! - Are you insane? No! Son of a bitch! I don't need anyone to teach you a lesson! I'll destroy the place! Leave her to me! You jerk! Scumbag! Coward! The one who can frighten me hasn't been born yet! Look, look at him! He's running away! What a shame! - Listen to me! Worm! - Maddalena! Come here, worm! You'll pay for this! - I said you don't scare me! No, the Tower of Pisa! No! Listen here, you'll pay for this! You'll pay! Meantime, you'll start paying jerk! You dirty snake! Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry, she's just crazy! I hope that was expensive! Call the police! Call them! Call the police! - Take this so you'll rest tomorrow! Your weekly rest! Stop her! The Duomo! Here you go! Stay down! Or I'll hit you all! Everybody, be calm! Don't move, everybody! Oh, yes, call the police! There she is. She's jealous. Insanely jealous. She's Italian, you see. She was my fiancée, but I don't want anything to do with her! Miss, what's your version of the facts? You don't have to respond. Thanks. Sometimes, I speak better without words. I understand. Hey, Roy! O'Connor's on the phone, calling from the Center Street Station. They say they got the mortadella girl. - What happened? She smashed up a restaurant and sent her ex-fiancé to the hospital. Tell him to keep her there until Fenner arrives. Fenner! Where's Fenner? You can never find that idiot when you need him! Fenner! Asshole! Goddamn pig! Son of a bitch! They want to arrest me just for breaking my damn husband's ribs! And I wanted to shoot him. You know why? Because tonight I returned to the house earlier than usual. And guess how I found him? In bed with another woman! - Hey, you. Disgusting pigs! Damn sneaks! What? I walk the streets just to support you and I find you in bed with another woman when I get home! The least I could do was kill him! Am I right or no? Worm! And these bought off pimps instead of arresting him, they arrest me! Go kill yourselves! Pipe down, Dora. Damn! You got a pair of tits that are out of this world! Who are you? I love tits the best. They're my favorite parts. In fact, I don't like anything else! Hey, boys! Hey, boys! When can I get these cuffs off? I'll tell you when it's time to take them off. Sit down! Are you incapable of answering politely? Pipe down, Dora. This place stinks! My wife has very small breasts, practically nothing. I… I didn't notice… before… before I married her. The other day, we had a babysitter. You should've seen what a pair she had. I couldn't control myself! How was I supposed to know she was only thirteen? I looked into her eyes and said, "Don't walk around like that with those two beautiful and huge tits!" And I jumped right on her! Hey, tell me, why are you here? I stabbed a man who touched my breasts. Well done! All of them should be taken out! They're all pigs! Disgusting! They only think of one thing! And even you ugly cuckolds think of nothing else! All of them are damn swines! Pigs! Pigs and nothing else! Impotent too! Pipe down, Dora. Come on, get your things. Where is the bathroom? Thanks. Hey… I don't get it, am I free or are you taking me to jail? I'm taking you to lunch. I paid your bail. You did? You did wrong. I mean thanks but I hate the idea of you wasting your money on that worm. Hi, Dominic. - Hi. If he sues for damages, he'll can get so much you'll be paying your whole life. I'm not even worried about it. I'd rather stay in jail. Anyway, I have no plans for now. Maybe, being in a quiet cell will do me good. To decide what I'm going to do. - Jail? Don't worry about it. I'll convince your fiance not to sue. I'll make him see it's not in his best interests. Scare him a little… he'll behave himself. You'll see. Any news about Mr "Jock"? Poor guy was in bad shape yesterday. A nice lesson every now and then can only do guys like him good. Why do you say that? He's a good person, kind, he tries really hard. Sure, he's a little incoherent. Maybe, a little nuts, if you like. You're not in love with him? No. I feel sorry for him. Where are we? - Times Square. The center of New York. The exhaust pipe of the universe. A city full of alcoholics, perverts, tramps, pimps, parasites, thugs. This scum is polluting America. But there are good people here too, right? Certainly, the majority of Americans. They don't make any noise. It's only the riffraff who like to make a stink. Where are you taking me? - To have a good American meal. As you see, Maddalena, there are still places in NY frequented by decent people. Places your reporter friend and that Mancuso wouldn't know. Because they're not gentlemen. You know, Madison once said… he's… that president down there, on the left, with the friendly face. He said that the American political system is based on people's natural inequality. Natural inequality. You said you wanted to stay in America, right? Yes, I don't want to go back to Italy. Especially after what happened. At least I want to try it, you see. In Italy, I'd still be alone, so as might as well. Naturally, I'll have to find a job. To be honest, a gentleman offered me a job. I think it's a salami factory or something like that. The kind of work I know. I only need to get a work permit. That done, I'll have no worries. I think I can help you. - Thank you. I'll find out all about this gentleman. Time to call mama and see if arrangements can be made to have you stay a night or two. It's logical that I help you as much as possible, I… I feel responsible. Responsible? Why should you feel responsible? You should've heard my boss. I was almost promoted on the spot when I told him your mortadella was gone. "At least, gimme some Alka Seltzer," I said. Hey, one moment. Wait right there. I don't understand. Why are they congratulating you? What did you do that was so special? Thanks to my iron stomach and my iron will, I figured out how to solve that mortadella business. Oh, really? I believed you were interested in my problems. Maddalena, listen to me well. The situation is difficult in America. Maybe, you're not aware of it. We must defend its institutions. I'm the first to admit that some laws are old and need to be reformed. But in times like these, we need to protect them. Good. Thank you. Why would a man like Mancuso go to any trouble for something so dumb as a mortadella held in customs? Because it's an opportunity to make a stink. The mortadella is a pretext. Starting from there, they attack the laws, the institutions, and the system, as they call it. Just think that poor reporter wanted to put in his article that you were a dishonest son of a bitch. Sorry, I think that's the word and I stopped him. I even fought him over it. - You did well. I thank you. You had the right idea of what needed to be done. Because you're a good egg, Maddalena. Exactly just like… - Mama? Yes. Speaking of her, I'd better telephone. You'll see that you'll get a nice dinner. I'm thinking… I bet she'll make a nice plate of lasagna. No! Better make Eggplant Parmesan. You said she makes it so well. OK, I'll tell her you requested it. Excuse me. "Give my regards to mama." Well? Have you found her yet? - Not yet. She was set free on bail by a certain Perlino. Dominic Perlino? Jesus Christ! Call the airport please. Customs. See if he's there. And if not, get the phone number and address. Hurry! Hey, Jack, gimme the 5 bucks you owe and I'll tell you something. Don't tell me. - You'll be sorry. You're wasting your time. The girl's not at the airport. Hey, one moment. What do you know? This is blackmail. Spit it out. Hey, Mr Fenner, a lady's downstairs, who says you stole her luggage. She wants your address, should we give it? Stop the presses! Get me a photographer, a stenographer, and send them to the lobby. Gimme a hand! Maddalena! My beautiful Maddalena! I knew you wouldn't let me down. You did it for me, right? My avenger! Not a bad title for tomorrow's article, don't you think? Two million readers at your feet! But first tell me everything you've done… No, stop right there, OK? I only want my things. I want to get undressed and go to bed between two clean sheets, even in the worst hotel in NY. I want to think about what I'm going to do with my life, OK? Silence! Enough! The lady is right! Damn right! The NY Daily News must wait until tomorrow! But there's no need to go to any cheap hotel. My place is at your disposal, you know. It awaits you with a warm and comfortable welcome. It's heaven, it has it all. Just you see! Alright. - Perfect. Let's go. Let's go. Here we are. Shit! God, what's on the ground? Ah, it's back! - But not for long. It's gone. - I said so. Get the candle from the pantry. Where is the pantry? - Straight ahead. Keeping walk forward. Yeah, straight ahead. I can't see a thing. Here's the pantry, I found it. - I told you. Now for today… The matches? - They must be on top of the fridge. Oh, the fridge… This always happens at the worst time. They do it on purpose! I'm playing blindman's bluff. Where are they? I spend so much time in the dark, I ought to learn braille! I found them! I found them, eh? Then light it. What are you waiting for? Have you not paid for months? No! Because it's a conspiracy. Holy cow! What does $35 matter anyway to a company like Edison? They got 14,000 employees. Half of them spend their time blowing up the streets while the other 7000 turn off poor people's lights. And meanwhile, the board is permanently behind a big table studying how to rip you off. I don't get what's so funny. Sorry, but I always thought that in America these everyday problems didn't exist. It's only just me. I bet everybody else gets by. But not me. What matters is not giving those sons of bitches any satisfaction! Even with my ass to the wall and surrounded, I have a nice drink, stuff myself with my nice pills and throw myself headlong into the fray. Blast it! - Goodness gracious. You keep using words that I've never studied in any book. Well, that means you chose the wrong books, like your loves up 'til now Here we go. Here you go. What's that? It's bourbon. - Bourbon? Yes. Jack Daniels, American whiskey. Warm, smooth, and high class. And you'll feel exactly like that. Well? What do you think? Just like you said. The only thing is that it'll let you down unless you take something with it. Pills! Energy pills! No, wrong ones… I gotta keep my wits about me. I got a ton of work to straighten out. Here they are. Want one? They keep you awake. Please, I just want to sleep. And I still don't know where I will sleep. What do you mean? - Sure. All this is at your disposal. My home is your home. Didn't… didn't we agree on it? Come, make yourself at home. Everything you need is here: a bathroom… Be careful with the water, the hot is cold and the cold is hot. Before opening the shower, light a candle for a few minutes. If the roaches don't have time to skedaddle, they'll clog the drain. If you wanna eat, the fridge is yours. Have another bourbon. Anything else? Oh, the bed! Sorry, I wasn't thinking. Here we go, take away this jacket. Get off! Here we… oops, my socks. Hey. Hey! - Eh? Eh, where are you sleeping? - I'm not sleeping, I'm working. You know how papers are. They want a blow-by-blow account on your first day in America. I'll dictate it on the phone and after that take a nap… Unless you want company. Alright, forget I ever said it. What you say is law. Even if you reconsider. Murderers! They stabbed me in the back! They even cut off my phone! Cut off my arm, my leg, anything but not my phone! Not my phone! It's a conspiracy! They're all in cahoots: Edison, the tax office, all of that fucking superstructure! They chose me to torture! Why me? Eh? What did I ever do to you? I'm only asking for a grain of humanity. Will you give it or not? Just a grain! Blast it! I'll screw them just the same by the calling from next door. Please, don't let anybody in. What are you taking? - Want one? But what is it? A downer. I'm too hyper! Poor Mr "Jock". Who is it? What happened? Did you mistake the faucet? - Yeah. Oh, poor "Jock". Everything happens to Mr "Jock". Indeed. Did you drink all of this? - Of course. How do you feel? - Very good. I've never met anyone before who could drink so much and not feel ill. You must be in really great shape. It's the only explanation. Ah, yes. A good heart, good bowels, good liver, good lungs. You're really a phenomenon. You're so in shape that every time I look you, I get a high. Here we go. Does it hurt. - Yeah… no, I don't know. I don't care and don't wanna know. I need a good sleep. That's what I need. Why don't you sing me a dirty song? That's all I need. Maybe a bit dirty lullaby? What's that? A lullaby. Hush. A lullaby? So much happiness, so much fear. I love you more than yesterday, less than tomorrow. Wonderful. Amazing. Then one day he said to me, "Maddalena, My love for you is too much, as is your pain. Tonight, we'll show up and walk through the town together like husband and wife." He was handsome, he was proud, one who didn't shit himself from fear. In politics and love, he went all the way, refusing, refusing to compromise. Wicked! I've pressed charges against you both! Adulterer! Scoundrel! There came desperation, caused by our fornication. The town was against it, against us, the public indignation. So, one blessed autumn day, there was a decision. To leave from here because there was no way out. His manly voice trembled… with emotion… when he said that over there… will give you a new life. I got my passport for America. Where the people are free to love. Where everyone does what he pleases underneath the Statue of Liberty. No, hold on. Why stop it? That's enough. It's over for good. Can't you restart it from the beginning? No, it's over and done with. The end. Alright. Listen, you want me to make some room for you? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - What is it? Daddy, get up! What are you doing? Who are they? - Come on, get up! Children! Don't break your father's balls! Out, out, out, out, out, out! Today is Saturday, darling! - Really? Then, let's pretend it's Thursday, seeing as you could never remember your duty. What? You think I got nothing to do but babysit these two bastards? I am a writer, by God! Sally, this is Maddalena. Hello. - Hello. Wow, that's some steak! - Mortadella. Hey, you read my yesterday's article? Awesome, eh? I've read better. I knew it: the fridge is empty and the light is off. Nothing has changed, eh, Jack? Hey, you two! What are you doing? Don't touch those blades! Out! Keep away or I'll slash my wrists! Me too! - You promise? Jack, the kids haven't had breakfast and I've a meeting at 10. Listen, you're right and I'm wrong, OK? Understand? You're right and I'm wrong. I should've remembered that the other day was my turn, OK? Let's skip it just this once. Impossible, I have an an ecology group meeting, it's not for kids. Jack, what can I do to make you remember Thursday is your day? Stamp it on his ass! That's not a bad idea. You can do that. If we keep on like this, I'll have to send them to school. You see, given the state of today's schools… Maddalena's not interested in our school problems! I gotta work today. I really can't! They didn't publish my piece last night… Because they hated it. Because they want me to flesh it out for the Sunday edition. And I got a million other things to do, I swear! Listen, I'm asking you as a favor, take them with you this time. Please! So sorry, I'm busy. Sally! If you become desperate, leave them with Wildflower. I'm already desperate! Maddalena, what's the matter now? In front of the kids. How shameful. Why? They don't give a shit you're here, neither does Sally. We didn't even bother to get a divorce because it wouldn't change a thing. It's just a big bother and expenses. I was sure you were happy as I was. It was a beautiful night, no? Especially when… remember? I messed up again. I can never do anything right. No, please, don't say that. It brings you bad luck. Besides, it's not true. - It is. It's true, Maddalena. You're kind. Very kind to me. Everyone is kind to me. Everyone allows themselves the luxury to be kind to this poor jerk. Bullshit! - I'm gonna cry! Boo-hoo! Why don't you two mind your own beeswax? It is our beeswax! Are you our father or not? Or is it not true? - Enough of this annoyance! Maddalena, I can't move from here. I'm waiting for my article's drafts. You mind bringing them to Wildflower? They know the way. OK, I can look for a room too. You already have a room! - No, I don't. Sure you do. You can't leave me after what happened last night… OK, we'll talk about it later. Let's go, kids. - Come back soon. I'll take some pills and I swear it'll change everything. But first I gotta sleep for 15 minutes. I didn't get any last night. And whose fault is that? Watch out! What are you doing, you idiot? That's mom. Hi, Lenny! Hi, kids. - Hi, Lenny! See who daddy slept with last night! Emily! I'm happy for Jack. It is a godsend which raises one's spirits to hit the jackpot every now and then. Nice to see you again, Maddalena. You know, I have in my head, the portrait I want to do of you. Lightly blurred with only two intersecting lights. I came to bring the children. Can they stay with you? Oh, of course. They're my best helpers. Come on, my brats. Lock yourselves in the dark room and develop this film. It's unexposed. This way, they'll be busy for a good while. I've no intention of posing for you, Mr Wildflower. I don't want you to pose. Not yet. Anyway not today. Because first you and I, the subject and artist, must come to a mutual understanding. An intimacy which should reflect our collaboration. Because that's the only way a picture… can become a lasting work of art. Art is born that way. Like life. Two human beings who enjoy their bodies. A man and a woman, positive and negative. It's very simple and very beautiful. If you don't understand this, you don't know what it is to make love and to be an artist. You're right, Mr Wildflower. I'm not an artist and never will be. Even with your collaboration. Please, look after the kids. Bye. Then we want to end it? - It is ended. Come, don't make me beg. You know it makes no sense. It can't be. We've been waiting for years. We love each other. If you think it over, what really happened? Nothing. Something very important did happen. Something I never would've done if I still loved you. But what nonsense! Come on… Smile, OK? Hey, Mr Fenner! I'd like a quick word with you. - Leave him be. C'mon. The fault was mine. I was the one who wanted it. Who among us is without fault? It's over. Put it here. You know what we say in my country? You win some, you lose some. But only I won. What's going on? - He wants to make up. Of course. That's how we Italian are: they fight, insult each other, great tragedies, broken hearts, jealousy, but in the end, there's still love. And nothing was broken after all. Isn't that so? There was a lot broken. Yes, certainly you broke lots of plates and glasses. Utter chaos. It made me open my eyes. I understood it was a gesture of love. Love's fury. How lovely you were, Maddalena! You excited me… so much! And you don't hold a grudge? - No, Mr Fenner. You know what I told myself? My lovely lady throwing her tantrum has opened wide the doors to my fortune. And your article, "The Avenging Mortadella" played its part. Last night, with all the restaurant a mess, I'm not kidding, people were lining up. Probably due to your article. They all wanted to see Maddalena and her mortadella. I say we leave the restaurant artistically smashed up, and change the name to "Mortadella", And you, Maddalena, Mrs Bruni, will see to the cash register and will make a lot of money. Can you imagine the business? - I sure can. My eyes have opened too. What if I don't marry you? I don't believe it. Nothing's changed. I made the first move and that's enough. Let's get married. A splendid future awaits us. We love each other and we'll be rich. Love reignites with money. You once married without love. Other times, other countries. We're in America. We're Americans! A minute ago, you said we were Italians. Do you think love is the only thing? No. But I do, Maddalena. But we must keep an eye on business too. Love comes with time. I speak for you because I love you. "Less than… tomorrow…" "More than yesterday." - And we'll be rich and happy. Just like in fairy tales, our friend Fenner will write a little about us in his paper. A little publicity never hurts. Of course, you'll be our guest for lunch and dinner. By the way, Mr Fenner, why not get up our marriage a bit? He could write a nice article, right, Maddalena? A great idea. It's just that before I become your wife, I must tell you something. Seeing that we're all Americans now. Last night I slept with him. With… Mr "Jock". What do you…what do you mean? I don't think it'll hurt our business, but maybe our marriage a bit. I don't believe you. You're just trying to test me. There's no need to test you. Is it true? I never contradict ladies as a matter of principle. Whore! I get it. You want to blackmail me? How much do you both want to get into the business? But no marriage. I don't marry whores. I don't know if you're American or Italian, but one thing is for sure: you're a real asshole. Jerk! What are you doing? Coward! Stinker! Can't you see he's hurt? Coward! Come on, get off him! He can't defend himself! Get off him! Give me a pill. Any one that you can find. Wonderful, Maddalena, don't ever leave me, eh? But first, give me a couple of pills. They're in the blue box on top. OK, Jack, but don't tire yourself with talking. Call me "Mr Jock." Please, Maddalena, I like it when you call me Mr "Jock". All right, Mr "Jock", now sleep. Music and sleep, sleep and music. I need music to sleep. But there's no electricity, thanks to the electric company pigs. Don't talk. How I hate them. Jesus, how I hate them. We'll manage all the same. I'll put on some music for you. Yes, that, the lullaby. Beautiful. Thank you, Maddalena. Marvelous. I was glad when you told that son of a bitch you slept with me. You were marvelous. Marvelous, Maddalena. That's what a free woman does. Well done. You were great. Everybody, I mean everybody can see that soon as they see you. I bet Wildflower got lucky too, right? Besides, you know, there's nothing wrong with that. No, because in a way, he's a friend. Friends are part of your family. You know what I think. Everything stays in the family. Everything: you, me, Sally, Andrew, Emily, Wildflower. All one big family, Maddalena. All together. And loving each other, one big family. You and I will always be the most important thing. You're wonderful, Maddalena, you're… the most important thing… You and me forever, forever you and me. I got my passport for America. Where the people are free to love. Where everyone does what he pleases underneath the Statue of Liberty. English subs by remorques and sineintegral@KG
