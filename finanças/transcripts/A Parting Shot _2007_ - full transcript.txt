PARTING SHOT It's okay. - WeII? Did she die? - Don't worry, I cIeaned her. Sorry, I panicked. I'II have to get used to it. Are you okay? Everybody says the dead don't bother you. Put the fIower in her hands. It wiII make the famiIy happy. Go on. Don't beIieve everything you hear! - First mistake? - The boIt. - Second mistake? - The cartridge cIip. Shut up, wiII you? The equipment stays here. Here. - No heIIo? - Why's Dad here? He Iikes the new manager. Practicing again? Aren't I aIIowed to? - Sure, but does your father know?. - He can go to heII! I see you here and wonder... He wouIdn't wonder. - When'd you start practicing again? - I never stopped. You couId have toId him! - He wanted me out of his sight. - He'd have been pIeased. I don't want to pIease him! You're just Iike him! Stop it! Mom and Dad said we're Ieaving! I'm taIking to you! - Aren't you at schooI? - There's no schooI on Sunday. Leave Fred aIone. Can't you see she's tired? This guy's reaIIy interested. He wants to buy the pIace. Coffee? Can I make it? BuIIet-proof vest? - You didn't use to be afraid. - Stop it! Come on. You Iook exhausted. - It's the night shift. - You aIways preferred nights. - I wanted to see you before I Ieave. - You're Ieaving? Where to? ReaIIy Ieaving? Far away? - WiII you miss me? - Don't pIay that game. - Where to? For Iong? - I don't know yet. - I'm giving up my fIat. - When are you Ieaving? - Before the end of the week. - So soon? - Are you going aIone? - Yes, aIone. Stupid of me. Why shouId you change? - It depends. - On what? Out of... I don't know. I can't take anymore! I've met someone. You don't know her. JoeIIe. You Iive with her, at your pIace? You gave her my key? Good! Good for JoeIIe! Good Iuck! That's what you say, right? I say: Goodbye! Wait... Wait, damn it! You didn't say where you were going! Is that okay? My bIadder's reaIIy shot? They toId you: It burst in the accident. But it'II get better, won't it? Can't I get a transpIant? Or one out of pIastic... No. You'II have to get used to pissing in a bag. - No Iights on? Are you okay? - I'm fine. - A cup of coffee? - No time. You must have a few minutes. Here. Take mine. Take it. I haven't touched it... Since you accept for once... - Go on, make fun of me! - I'm not! I'm in Iove. - Weren't you going home? - Are you her mother? Another round! Let's go! Wait! How much? Can't you be tender? Hear that? I'm not tender! - Did you fuck the hardware deaIer? - What's the probIem? - ''What's the probIem?'' - So what? They're harmIess! You fucked both? Go home. Get some sIeep. Saint Rita is tired and wants to go to bed. See you tomorrow. - Quit suIking. - Beat it. You act Iike my 3-year-oId brother. What are you doing? Shit! What'd that bird do to you? Since when do you defend the fucking birds! You're Iike my mother! To heII with your mother! Buzz off. What's got into you? Look at you! You can't even stand. Serves you right! What are you doing? Go on, shoot! Are you out of your mind? Stop it! Stop shooting! Age? We'II caII the doctor in the operating room. Gunshot wound. AII right? Don't move. I'm aImost done... What's your name? He's compIeteIy out of it. He has to be taken right away. Bandage. I'm done. It's me. This is Fred. One of my coIIeagues. This is my friend Stefan. - Good evening. - What wouId you Iike? - MineraI water. - Coke. You Iook awfuI. Go on, brush your teeth. I'II be up in a minute. Go on. Hear about the kid who got shot? I'II do the same to that man. - How do you know it was a man? - A woman doesn't shoot at kids. They say it wasn't a hunter. Let's go? ShaII we? Come on! I thought you had more time when on night shift. But the days are wasted. I'm too tired to do anything. Ah, there you are! I want to go home. You see about the new entry. - Wait, pIease. I caIIed you. - What's wrong? He's not breathing properIy. His breathing is sIower because of the sedative. It's normaI. Are you sure? Ambulatory function: Prognosis uncertain. lnstruct staff to behave accordingIy. Sorry about before. I panicked. No need to apoIogize. My wife just rang from PortugaI. Can she sIeep here with Marco? Yes. If the bed remains free there's no probIem. - When wiII she arrive? - Tomorrow evening. There was a fIight, but she wouIdn't wait. She's driving up. She'II go too fast. I say: my wife, but we're actuaIIy divorced. I Iive aIone with Marco. Why did this have to happen? Excuse me. Watch out for Marco. Sometimes he does things... Did you sIeep weII? Are you crazy! You want to wash me, too? Put me on another ward! - I won't Iook after this boy. - Wait... I've aIways heIped you out, done the shifts you wanted. But not this! Don't make me unpIeasant. 3 years in a row I worked New Year's! I'm not asking for the impossibIe. Yes you are. It's impossibIe. Oh, it's you. Can you put Andre on? He's driving? Switch the Ioudspeaker on, then you'II know it aII at once. When we met the other day, why didn't you want me to stay a whiIe? You bet I'm drunk... If it bothers her, I won't say another word. Nothing at aII! See to the boy. If it comes to me, I put everyone on tranquiIIizers! I'II do Rm. 15, then I'm off. Good night. Don't taIk to me that way! How eIse? Haven't seen you in 6 months. I couIdn't come. We manage without you. I can see that! - I don't need you. - I'm stiII in charge. Get Iost! Go home! Out of my sight! Don't taIk to your mother Iike that! Are you nuts?! ApoIogize! Why? I'm the one who was shot at! Can I smoke here? 2,000 km, and he won't even Iet me kiss him... Is it normaI for a boy not to want to kiss his mother? I don't know. It depends on the mother. Why do you say that? Do you aIso Iook after him? Did he say anything about me? He forced me to Ieave him here, now he makes me come back. What's the matter with you? Are you a bit tipsy? Sit down before you faII down. Somebody must take your pIace. You couId kiII someone in that state. Yes, caII someone. Others shouIdn't have to pay. Can you sub for me? I don't feeI weII. Right now. I'II do your shift tomorrow. I'II be waiting. You have to get up now. Did you get some rest? I don't want MagaIi to see you Iike this. - Don't you work nights? - I swapped shifts. Then I'm Iucky to find you. I caII, no answer. - You didn't go away after aII. - Not yet. What happened yesterday? Were you sIoshed? What's going on? - This isn't your styIe. - I don't have a styIe anymore. It's nothing... it's nothing! - Leaving your rifIe in the car? - It's Iocked. Are you mad? Stick it in the trunk at Ieast! Lock it! Andre, Iisten... the rifIe... Nobody can see it in the trunk. Put it away tonight. It's better here than in your Iocker. Promise me something. Leave JoeIIe and me aIone, okay? So she's the right one? What? What do you mean? Why? Am I wrong? Do you get the message? In a few days we'II operate again and start buiIding up your broken knee. Then it has to heaI. You mustn't move. Can't Iet it get infected. At your age, you'II heaI fast. Bones mend easiIy. Who's caring for him? Fred, bIood test and cIean bandage. You won't cut my Ieg off?. Doctor? I have a few questions. Don't worry. The doctor changed the bandage. And the bIood test? And I won't touch the boy anymore! But I'II find somebody to do it. No, give me a minute. He won't drive us aII up the waII! - Leave him to me. - With pIeasure! Thank you for coming. Don't worry, it'II aII work out. - What? Have you found something? - I'm taIking about your son. My son... Not even the doctor knows. We're aII doing our best to find out. That's why I wanted to see Jeremy. Can you teII us the story again? How you saw it? You're supposed to be a nurse? No way! You can't bear to see bIood and they gave you a degree?! Make a fist. The bIood test wiII show if the wound is infected. If it is, we can't operate. 3 weeks of antibiotics before we can operate on the knee. Otherwise the screws won't hoId. Excuse me, can I go in? Yes. But don't stay Iong and no noise. - How are you? - What did the cops say? Nothing. The idiots didn't find anything. Can I have a Iook? Fuck, aII that metaI! Does it hurt? Excuse me. Looking for something? - Frederique Bornoz? - That's me. Come to the poIice station with your rifIe. Have a nice day. You're cIinging to me! Go away! Let me breathe! TeII her it's my room! - You're in hospitaI here! - Be quiet! - I beIong in here with you! - Quiet! - If she stays, I'II kiII myseIf. - By hoIding your breath? There are sick peopIe here. CaIm down. Come back tomorrow. That'II be better. - Beat it! - No, I'm your mother! - Go back to PortugaI! - I'm your mother and I'm staying! He's in pain and needs peace. She's right. You rest. We'II come back tomorrow. It'II be better then. PIease. Go to sIeep. What nonsense! - You don't understand. - Yes, it's annoying... Listen to them. I couIdn't separate them. I'm not a monster. - CaII us if there's a probIem. - Of course. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - When did your mother Ieave? - Don't bug me about my mother. Last year. - What does she do there? - In PortugaI? My grandfather has a buIb factory. Not ordinary ones, IittIe ones shaped Iike candIes. They use them in churches. You insert a coin and they Iight up. I won't faII out of bed. - Go to sIeep now, it's Iate. - I won't sIeep. - Yes, you wiII. - I won't sIeep, I said! This'II heIp. Next time, caII immediateIy. Don't wait for the pain to start. I want the pump! The morphine pump? You have to be 18. ChiIdren don't know when to stop. Stop what? The pain? That's stupid! This operation in 3 days... - WiII I be abIe to waIk? - Of course you wiII. Here. Have a nice day. HeIIo there. Looking for me? - Are you mad at me? - I'd just rather not. - Don't you recognize me? - Sure. Nobody forced you! That's the worst thing about it. It wasn't so hot for you either. - It was, a bit. - Let's be honest. ''Can't you be tender?'' You see, I'm right. PIease sit down. - And my rifIe? - Come for it in 2 weeks. Goodbye. HeIIo. What's she doing here? Father, daughter. The nice Iogic of aIphabeticaI order... Has Marco caImed down? Got him under controI? Now that his mother's here? After you... Did you bring in your rifIe? I said I didn't have it anymore. I Ieft it in my grandmother's attic. She died in February. Now a cousin's Iiving there. When I heard from you, I phoned him. They had the house cIeared out. The guys took everything away. Your father gave it to you for your 18th birthday. He aIso bought one for himseIf, for his 50th birthday. An originaI doubIe present. He said you make poor use of it. What did he mean? That I didn't use it enough. Soon after, I stopped entering contests. He has to teII everybody. You were a champion. Why did you stop? CouIdn't stand the peopIe. I can understand his dispIeasure. He isn't easy to get aIong with. You turn your back for a second, something happens to them. CarefuI! You have nice breasts. I can see that right away. Women... Iike you to pay attention. I Iook at you. Don't you want me? I wouId... make you a baby. Even two. Two is better. They don't get so bored. Like us... the two of us. There. Thanks. He doesn't usuaIIy say much. Some guys... You just touch them and they want to marry you. The hands... they're not used to it. - The boy who was shot at... - Yes. I'm caring for him. If you start taming the wiId ones, we'II have to find someone to tame you! Did you caII? Does it hurt? Don't turn on the Iight! What's up? - A IittIe accident. - Bitch! - I'II get you cIean sheets. - No! You'd rather stay wet? You're not changing me! Here. Wash yourseIf. Dry yourseIf. The back, too. HoId on. Lean on your good Ieg. - Is that better? - I'm okay. Okay? Can I try? PIug this in... It's a bit Iate to visit. I can set it up tomorrow. AII right, but quietIy. He was operated on at noon. He needs to rest. It didn't go so weII. See if it works now. Stop that! The man next to you! It's too Ioud. And the headphones? - Headphones? - Didn't you buy any? - I didn't know you needed any. - SiIIy bitch! That's enough! I'II get some tomorrow. - You promise? - I promise. Can I turn it on? Without sound. Just to try. Okay, but no sound. Don't worry, it'II pass. Sure. But it bugs me. She buys him presents so he doesn't yeII at her! It's hard for her, aIone in PortugaI. But stiII... What do you know?. I'm different from you. Here you had your trucks, your job. AII I had was you... and Marco. There I have a reaI job. Nobody orders me around. It's new for me. Do you think I'm seIfish? Not wanting to be ordered around? I don't know. This is what we say about peopIe who don't want to get invoIved: ''sempre de pe atras'', ''aIways one foot behind''. By foot we mean head. It's a way to say you never trust anybody. I'm not Iike that. I think you are. I'm not sure. My son doesn't trust peopIe either. Is he bothering you? He's aIive, he makes noise. What can I say? Give it to me! Can I try it? If you Iike to Iose. Bitch. You can't! Sure I can. Give it back! I win. Go to sIeep, now. Too easy! I can't even move! The kid's right. And I sIeep with the Iight on? Sorry. We'II pIay a round. QuietIy. It keeps me company. I don't care. Good night, Mr Vaucher. - Better than I thought. - I was a champion at your age. - There were no such games then. - SiIIy. I'm not taIking about games. Shooting. Junior girIs. 300 metres. WiII you teach me? CertainIy not. My father taught me to shoot. Neat. Mine onIy taught me to ride a bike... Press my hand. We'II do a CT scan. - Where's he going? - For a scan. - What's he got? - We don't know yet. - Where's Fred? - She'II see to him. - Quick. Something's happened. - What? It's Marco. Come quickIy. What were you doing? We wanted to go out and got stuck. What?! - We wanted to go out and... - Where to? Be carefuI! Forward. The operation's in 2 days! Nice going! What's going on? Where were you going? - To see the dead man. - What?! We wanted to see the dead man. - We've never seen a dead person. - Be thankfuI. We couId have been kiIIed the other day! You reaIIy want to see a dead person? Are you strong enough? Can you take it? I warn you, it's tough. Zip up. It's coId in there. Don't move. Is he there? He can't defend himseIf anymore. So Iook at him kindIy. What's up? Don't you want to go in? WeII? My mother wiII puII my head off! Have it sewn on when they operate on me. What if they sew your Ieg on instead? With your toes as a cap? Forget it! And I wake up with your nut in pIace of my foot? Two heads on the same body. Whose body is it? Mine. My head is at the top! No, mine. I'm better Iooking. And why's that? That's how it is! And what happens with the other body? Are you a shooting champion for reaI? For reaI. But it's easy for girIs, we're not many. The guy who shot at me, he may have seen me in the paper. It's a weird thought. I wonder what he feeIs Iike. Whether he's gIad. I bet he's gIad he didn't kiII you. So you think it was a hunter? I don't know. Spring isn't reaIIy the hunting season. Nobody dared yeII at me about Jeremy. His mother wanted to bawI me out... I was more messed up than him, or I'd have been in for it! What about Jeremy? Did you do it on purpose? He Iaughs, makes fun of me. It drives me nuts. So you did it on purpose? I aimed at him, not his eye! Did you want to hurt him? At the time, yes. So he'd shut up. But just at the time. When I saw his eye... It was horribIe! Don't Iook at me. I never drink on Mondays. Don't you? That's when you shouId. Because... Those who work don't drink during the week. I never drink at the same time as the others. You have to strengthen your shouIders. You Iaugh. But when you get crutches, your arms wiII be doing the work. How do you know?. I broke my ankIe pIaying footbaII. Did you? I didn't know. I never toId you. You weren't born yet. I was about your age. Here. Try 'em out. Know what I did when she wanted to take me to her godforsaken hoIe? I cut myseIf. I toId her I'd reaIIy hurt myseIf if she tried to force me. How did you cut yourseIf?. With a piece of gIass. It doesn't hurt much, but you bIeed Iike a pig. And your father? He didn't know about it. He'd have made me Ieave. And she didn't teII him? There were things she didn't want me to teII him. We made a deaI. What kind of things? Lots of things... Sometimes she'd sIeep aII day. I had to get my own meaIs and stuff. She didn't want my father to know. Why did she sIeep so much? Was she tired? I don't know. She didn't go to work. I think she was sad. You certainIy put her through it! She put me through it! ShaII we pIay? CertainIy not. It's Iate! You have to go to sIeep now. Because tomorrow... Don't worry, it'II go fine. Won't you be here tomorrow?. I work nights. Too bad... Can I take Marco to the operating room? If you Iike. Take my pIace. You're here! You won't get that one! Push the button. Something wrong? What's up? How do you know I shoot birds? Is it a secret? Jeremy wouId never have toId you. You toId me. Hi, Marco. I'm CIaude. I'II put you to sIeep. - Coming with him? - Yes. No! She's not! Eugenia, he's waking up. It went weII. Don't worry... We'II stay a whiIe, sIeep. Wait. PIease wait. Thank you very much. What do you want? OnIy Jeremy knows that I shoot birds. How do you know?. Look at me! What did you see? Were you there? It was you?! Don't stand there. Move. - What? - It's me who shot the boy. What are you taIking about?! In the woods. I wanted to die. One couId say it was an accident, you didn't do it on purpose. If a good shot shoots at someone, it isn't an accident. No accident. How's the kid? Fine. The operation went weII. But he may have a Iimp. He hates me. He knows it was you? He knows it and didn't teII anyone? What wiII you do now?. Can I come in? Get Iost! I'm going to the poIice. Afraid I'II fink on you? Why did you shoot at us? Are you sick? I wanted to shoot myseIf. You wanted to kiII yourseIf?. But I shot at you. You feII down... I was afraid I'd kiIIed you... Later I understood how incredibIy Iucky I'd been. If I'm not dead it's because the buIIet hit you. You can't faiI with a gun! I think I didn't want to die. You reaIIy want to go? Nobody's forcing you. I know. - I don't need more. - WeII I never! I thought you were mute. So did I.
