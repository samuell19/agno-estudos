My father, who was a career diplomat, was posted to Vienna, Austria, to the Chinese legation there in the spring of 1937. He was fluent in German. He was very social. He had very many Jewish friends because Vienna was really the cultural hub of Western Europe. And as soon as Hitler came in, the persecution was so public, so humiliating.

And through its great docks and channels passed most of the wealth of the Orient. In Shanghai, truly, the East met the West.

Then the Americans came in. They got a part. Later, the French arrived, and they said, "We want part of Shanghai, too, that we can control with our government." And then starting in the 1930s, you have the Japanese.

It really put cheek by jowl this incredible wealth and this incredible poverty. The Jewish community of Shanghai was actually very diverse by this point. There were the Jewish refugees coming from Vienna and from Berlin. There was also a Russian Jewish community, Russian Jews who had come after the Russian Revolution. But the first wave are the Baghdadi Jews who come in the 19th century. All of the Baghdadi Jews who came were global financiers already. They were dealing with India, they were dealing with London. And they end up taking over the opium trade. Jacob: My parents are Orthodox Iraqi Jews from China who worked for an opium dealer. In some ways, it was like they were not in China -- they were in their own little bubble. Shanghai in the '30s was a place of immense wealth, and the Baghdadi Jews were a huge part of the wealth. Families had servants, and there were dance halls. They had horses at the racetrack. Once the refugees started arriving, it was overwhelming for our Jewish community. And my mother was quite astonished by their condition and said that she had never met a poor Jew before. Kaufman: "We're the wealthy Jews of Shanghai." Like, "Who are these folks suddenly giving us a bad name?" I think ultimately what the wealthy Jews realize is, is that their fate is tied to these refugees. They can't turn their back on them. Victor Sassoon, who is really the king of Shanghai -- he's a billionaire, very influential. The Japanese appoint a man named Inuzuka to be in charge of the Jewish question. He really believes, in this kind of anti-Semitic way, that Victor Sassoon controls everything because he's a wealthy Jew. Victor Sassoon understands that, and so what happens over the next year and a half, two years, is this ballet that goes on, or you could call it a con job, where Victor Sassoon encourages the Japanese to believe that, yes, he's talking to the British government, he's talking to the Americans, he'll think of investing in Japan. "Just keep on protecting these Jews who are coming in, and I'll make sure things work out." And so the Baghdadi Jews begin to find the refugees housing, to feed them, helping them pay for things.

They had been going to school, they played sports. They had had a normal life. Suddenly, they were uprooted and thrown into conditions of terrible poverty, disease. But it was also completely unstructured. These children were roaming the streets during the day. They were forming gangs. I think for the parents, this was the most heartbreaking thing. They thought, "My children have no future. My children have no hope." What I think really changed that for them was the Kadoorie School. Fogel: A very wealthy Jewish man by the name of Horace Kadoorie opened a school for the Jewish kids. Silberberg: Life at the Kadoorie School was, for me, one of the most important things of Shanghai. It gave me the education I had. Fogel: Our school had a wonderful principal -- Lucie Hartwich. I can see her in front of me right now. She wore her hair with a wave. Always made-up. She was a no-nonsense person who insisted that we learn English. Silberberg: The idea of us not talking German in school was just that we didn't like the Germans, and second of all, if you graduated from our school, if you graduated from our school, you automatically could enter the University of Cambridge because they followed that program. This school also had a lot of activities. It wasn't just come to school, learn, go home. Fogel: I danced. Mister Erstein, he was our teacher.

Silberberg: We had Jewish youth organizations, and we had theatrical plays. It was always to a Jewish theme, all the time. We were taught, "You are Jews, no matter what." And that sticks. Tobias: My parents joined a synagogue called Ohel Moshe, and our Hebrew school, called the Talmud Torah, was also there on the third floor. The fact that I was reading the holy language was a source of great comfort to my parents and to me. Studying the sacred texts really meant that Judaism was alive, and therefore that I was alive.

They had said the most efficient way of liquidating our community was to put us on a bunch of rickety old junks, tow us out to the Yellow Ocean, and sink us. To their credit, the Japanese simply refused to do that.

Silberberg: The Japanese guy came in, he slapped my dad, and said, "Out by tomorrow." Kaufman: As a compromise measure, the Japanese say, "We'll put them in a ghetto. We'll put them in a 1-square-mile area of Hongkou." Maybe half the Jews were living in other parts of Shanghai, and they were all ordered to abandon their apartments, abandon their belongings, and trudge over to this ghetto, which was monitored by Japanese guards, which was adding another 10,000 people to a community that was already filled, overflowing.

They appointed a civil servant by the name of Ghoya -- Mr. Kanoh Ghoya, who was the chief administrator of the ghetto. And Ghoya said, "Napoleon, he was a great man, but I'm a greater one. I am the emperor of the Jews." Marcus: He was a nutcase! Silberberg: The guy was very short and actually, when he wanted to slap somebody, had to get up on a chair.

There are tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai. The crisis has become so big, the Joint finally decides that it has to do something. And they go to a woman named Laura Margolis, who is a representative of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, to try to help the refugees. She was in Cuba when theSt. Louis, which was a ship carrying European refugees, had tried to enter Cuba and been turned away. And then it went to America and was turned away, returned to Europe, and presumably some of the refugees were killed. And she swore to herself at that point in Cuba that if she ever had the chance to help refugees, that if she ever had the chance to help refugees, she would do whatever she could to make sure that tragedy wasn't repeated. She arranges to meet Captain Inuzuka, the anti-Semitic captain who's in charge of Jews in Shanghai. And she says to him, "If there isn't enough food, these refugees are going to start to riot, and that will be dangerous for you and dangerous for the Japanese. I'm completely apolitical. Let me help them." So Inuzuka agrees. She's able to start getting more food to the refugees, more housing. Marcus: They bought these huge, like, warehouses that were called Heime.

[ Laughter ] I'm very proud of you for what you went through and what you made of your life. Helga's daughter: If I can say something, too? My mom has taught me so much in life. Whenever anything is down, she brings me right up. And that's made me, you know, a tough lady. I mean, she is a tough lady to compete with, I mean, she is a tough lady to compete with, but her motto in life is, "There's always worse things." Yeah, that's what she always says. Thank you, Mom. Silberberg: Welcome. I've been able to install that in you, that's good. -[ Laughter ] -Yes. Yes, you did. Silberberg: The whole experience taught me that nothing is for sure. Everywhere I live, I know that any day, it might not be home anymore. And it's not that devastating if it does happen. Blumenthal: I always knew that, at heart, basically, I was still Werner Michael Blumenthal, whether I was the Secretary of the Treasury or whether I was a United States Ambassador or a CEO or a professor or whatever. I always knew, tomorrow, that could all be gone. And what's important is what kind of person I am, how I conduct myself. That's one of the important lessons that I learned in Shanghai. When all those are gone, what kind of a human being will you be? Most people think that in order to be a Holocaust survivor, you have to have a number on your arm and you have to have spent time in a concentration camp. But that's not so. It was time. It was time that I started to speak, and to talk about what happened. I've lost track of the thousands of students that I have spoken to. We live in an age now where there are people that need to escape their countries because of the horrors that are going on. It breaks my heart to see people trying to come to our country, that is plentiful, being turned away. This never happened to us when we went to Shanghai. Shanghai opened their arms to us. Tribe: For me, the Jewish culture that I grew up with embodies the importance of being truthful, of seeking justice, of doing what you can to help others. We all probably have some elements in ourselves that could make us, under other circumstances, treat people horribly, which is what makes it all the more important to have a structure of law and a system of rights and a system of commitments to the equal human rights of everybody. We are one of the lucky people who had a door open when so many others have doors shut. Opening those doors is an obligation, not just an opportunity. [ Knocking ] Ho: Lotte! Ho: Lotte! Oh, wait a minute. Yay, I'm so glad to see you. Marcus: [ Laughs ] Have a seat. Sit down. Nobody can really imagine what it was like for me to meet you and find out who your father was. That was what, 17 years ago, Lotte? You came here with your lemon cake, and I brought out my passport. And you opened it up, and there was all this Chinese writing. And you said, "See that number that's there? That's the number of visas my father gave that day." I figure, at least that day, they issued -- the Chinese consulate issued or stamped at least 100 visas that day. I was overwhelmed that after 70 years, or 60 years... Yeah. ...my story turned upside down. I believed before that some clerk had just stamped this Shanghai visa, but now I saw that somebody knew it to save people. That's totally different. Ho: My father was never reunited with any of the people that he helped. He was unknown to most of them. And so when I meet these people, I feel that my father's efforts were worth it. I jokingly call them mymishpacha, which in Yiddish means my family. It's like a miracle to me, and you and I have become very good friends. And it doesn't change the darkness, but it gives light into the darkness. [ Indistinct conversations ] -Remember where it is? -Ah, ah, ah, ah... Look over here. You see it? -Yeah, that's right! -That's my nana. Boy: That's my nana. That was her brother. That's the whole family. This is the list of all the people that were able to come here when your great-great-grandma came here. Kaufman: This miracle occurred because certain people stepped up at the right moment. I think the Baghdadi Jews did, I think Laura Margolis did, Ho Feng Shan, so I think there were individuals who did it. But more than that, this was a place, the most unexpected of places, that saved these Jews when they needed help the most. Beyond politics, beyond, you know, rivalries and economics and military things, in the end, there was a human connection that was established between the Chinese and the Jews. that was established between the Chinese and the Jews. And I think that created a common bond that you certainly didn't see anywhere else in the world. ♪♪ Woman: The years fell away and I saw myself -- I saw the young girl and her parents walk off the gangplank eight years before. Coolies in sweat-stained rags were hauling loads, children shrieked and chased each other on the docks. It hadn't changed. And as I looked at the city that had sheltered us from the horrors of Hitler's war, all I saw in front of me was a fine city bathed in sunlight under a China-blue sky. I saw dainty Chinese ladies in long silken gowns strolling in beautiful gardens. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Major funding provided by
