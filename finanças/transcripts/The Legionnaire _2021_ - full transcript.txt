Open up! Charge! Charge! Honey, I'm home. Where are you, love? Honey? Sorry. Hello, love, how did it go? Good, the usual away stuff. Listen, I'm going to sleep for a couple hours. Then come and see me, I have to tell you a something. WE RESIST BUILDING OCCUPIED SINCE 2005 Makhlouf. -Mancini. -Here I am. -Mazur. -Here. -Meta. -Here. -Memushi. -Yes. -Moreno. -I'm here. -Mostafa. -Here. -Nardelli. -Here I am. -Nesterenko. -Yes. Nicolescu. -Noussir. -I'm here. Novakovic. -Nunziata. -Here. Nwanganga. Okay. So, first order on the agenda: Luca's moving from the house. Quiet, hey! Silence. Easy! Quiet. Quiet! Stop it! That's why we're here. By show of hands. Let's vote. Who wants Luca to be removed from the house for a week? -I'll raise two, look. -Where could I go? -Where can I go? -Luca, I'm sorry. The decision is clear enough. Look, you're lucky that it's only for a week. Do you know how many good families would like an apartment like yours? But if I have to go, you have to go away, too, because it's your fault if the wall went down. -Well... -He's right about that. Pietro has been saying for five months that there's work to be done. And he hasn't seen a penny for these jobs in five months. Secondly: does the elevator work? Who fixed the elevator? Again, Pietro. But still, Pietro didn't see a penny! Third of all: now Pietro is leaving. -Good! -Yes. -Go away, like you always do. -Yeah, right. That's the only thing you are good at. But why didn't the committee allocate the money for the repairs? No, because it so happens that we feed the kitty every month. Got it? What are you... Quiet! He's right about what? We all voted for it, right? The works for the building were the last priority. Oh no, dear. Here we all knew that if someone got hurt they would throw us all out. -It was your responsibility. -Come on, Mancini, be good. "Come on, Mancini, be good" what? I don't want to get kicked out for your mistakes! Okay? Mancini, please. It's not Patrick's fault. Do not always be so quarrelsome, come on. No, sure. Why should they clear us out? We are all happy, calm, and content... The building is fine... Fuck you. Let's move on to the next point. Oh well, it doesn't seem like a big problem anyway, does it? You've seen Davide, he's grown up. He could stay with his grandmother for a bit. Too bad she wasn't here. I had to wait for her and now I'm late for work. Oh, come on. You're a few minutes late, it's not a big deal. -Patrick, I'm never late for work. -Sorry. Pietro, I can't right now. I'll call you later. Why are you mad? You could've avoided having a child with an occupant who clears cellars to live. Mind your own business, you made one with an alcoholic bricklayer. Those were other times and another country. What did she say? -Nothing. -Come on, tell me what she said. Hey, we're in Italy. You must speak Italian. Italian! Why do you always speak Albanian, when I'm here? Why... I'm ready! Hey, son! Are you ready? I'm ready, too. I was waiting for you. Come on, I'll go out with you. Bye. Please, make him do his homework for tomorrow. Do I look like the type who doesn't do homework? Did you think you were the stronger here? You move like a girl! Stop! Stop! You hit him on the head. Stop. Stop. Do 30 pushups and go home. Come on. If we fail to be clean during training, we are not clean on the street either. And then we get in trouble! Do we want to go to court, guys? Next. Come on, Hot choc. I want you focused, come on! Oh look, they told me the mobile unit was full of fags, but they didn't tell me it's also full of apes. Bravo, like that. Yes! Did you tell your mother, on the boat, that you are a policeman and a fagot, too? Bravo, yes! Enough, there you go! That's how you do it. Good job, Hot choc. -How cute, the little black girl. -Go take a shower and go home. Way to go, Hot choc. Good fucking job! Good job, Hot choc. Come on, you get in. Go up. Come on, guys. -Eagle, but he hadn't retired? -They sent him back. What the fuck! -I told you I can't play. -Wait. Take the keeper. Let's change. -Golden goal. -Like you're safe now. -We have to win. -You must always be in front of the ball. -Yes, I know. I was. -Caution. Be careful, otherwise tomorrow you have to clean our boots. -Go, Cafù, Cafù. Come on. -Eh, Cafù. What the fuck. They're close to cleaning our boots... And tomorrow you polish our boots. You have to give me 50 Euros since yesterday. I won't forget. -Clean up, Hot choc, clean up. -What do I have to give you? Come on, let's continue. -Hey. -Hey. -How are you? -I'm fine. Look, why don't you get transferred to the office? How can I? Without overtime and without assignments... will you pay for my mortgage? Come on, don't worry. I'm fine. Look, I'm a beauty. I'll get to work. Bye, man. -See you. Bye. -Yes. Whoever does not bring 5 euros tomorrow won't get on the truck. -Guys, pay attention for a moment. -He won't get... Can you hear me? So, no shift at Montecitorio tomorrow. The new service order has arrived. We'll meet here at 6 a.m. You wanted to meet with ladyboys tonight, huh? You perverts. Asshole. -Are you done? -Yes. Be punctual, we must go to San Giovanni. Sure. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Valencia Happy birthday to you Hurray! Go, Valencia! Thank you, my friends. May God bless you. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday, Valencia! Look, Mom, why don't you and Patrick come and stay at my place tonight? Why? Come on, I'll give you a hand to take everything you need. But we have an agreement with the municipality. My son, and where will we go? Come and stay at my house until you find a new accommodation. We'll talk after the party. I'm just saying the prefect has already ordered to clearing out this building. Tomorrow morning here will be full of police, do you understand? Don't worry, Mom, these are just threats. They can't throw 150 families on the street. They can, trust me. -Trust you? -Yes. And who are you? Who are you? Daniel the riot cop? Who are you? Can you listen to me for once? Just once! This occupation has been going on for 16 years, Daniel, they can't ignore it. Come and stay at my house, you and Mom, now! Then we will find a solution together. What the fuck are you saying? What solution? You come here and throw kids out on the street? Your own mother? Because you know they will make you do it. Don't you touch me. Do you remember the promise? I'm talking to you. Do you remember the promise? Do you remember how difficult it was to get in here? When we couldn't sleep at night because there were those shitty cops like you who had to clear us out? Of course you don't remember. Do you remember this sofa? Hey, I'm talking to you. Won't you even look at it? This shitty bed we paid for with our own money. We put all this stuff here. And you put it here too, don't you forget it, asshole. Mom. Mom! Please. At least you. We stay here. This is our home. -Did you hear what your mother said? -Hey! Do not overdo it. Good, go away, go. -Hi, Trisha. -Hello, sweetheart. Look, I ordered a shitload of pizza for tonight. Even a Margherita with buffalo mozzarella. Pregnancy makes me hungry. Love, I'm not hungry. Tomorrow I have to wake up at five to work. Daniel. Daniel? -Eagle? -Hey. Do I have to worry? No, why? You don't show up for work, you only send a text... I didn't sleep at all last night. When I got up, everything was spinning, I had to argue with Trisha to go to the ER. -How are you now? -Better. I took some medicine, I'll be operational tomorrow. Don't play these jokes on me anymore, huh? You know that with age I am becoming apprehensive. Anyway, I was really worried. -Look, how did the clearing out go? -We didn't do shit. They had organized themselves, we risked making a mess. -I see. -Police station is full of communists. -One of them must've ratted us out... -It's likely. What now? Now? What do you want, the riot cop's horoscope? If they call us, we go back there with the cavalry. I'm sorry, Daniel. It's for you. It's your mother. Listen Eagle, we'll talk tomorrow. Trisha is calling me. Go, don't worry. Enjoy your recovery. Mom? Are you still there? Sign these papers, quick, come on. -Give me time, okay? -Time? Time is up. At least let me see what this is. What do you have to see? Sign! You too, sign below, come on. -With this excuse... -Give me these papers! Oh, sorry. Come in. I'm sorry. I think Patrick Issa is here. So? I would like to know if he has been charged with crimes and if he needs a lawyer. Come back later. Look, I'm his brother and... Do you think we are an information center? Get out, please, go. Well? Anyway, thank you. But not for the police, thanks for the tip-off. Daniel? Could it be that under that black riot cop surface still beats the heart of an occupant? -Don't go there. -No, never mind. It went well. So now you can get out of there without any more trouble. You see? You always have to ruin everything. By the way, we spoke to Carlo Marson, the one from the Municipality for the housing emergency. Looks like we'll have a meeting with him tomorrow. Marson is good, he's half-communist. Like you, right? Listen to me. Write it down. Accept everything Carlo Marson offers you without compromise, okay? -Tomorrow you go there in my place. -I wish. What time is it? See, you don't understand. If you don't take things, nobody will give them to you. I promised Mom I'd take you home safe, if I beat you, I'll break the promise. Let's stop right here. I'm going to pay. I'm paying! Go, pay for these two spritzes, you get the money from the State anyway, right? So come on, let's move the economy. I'm the one doing it, not you. Go, go! Fuck. This riot cop is stingy, too. -Excuse me, how much do I owe you? -Just a sec. What can I get, a hot chocolate or a nice black coffee? Pitch black. Listen, do you want to fight? Fuck... I was already about to punch you. But if you were shitting your pants. Sonia, good evening. The usual, thanks. What are you doing here? I'm just passing through. In Valle Aurelia? I live there. Nobody is passing through here. I'm passing through. Oh, you are passing through. -Right. -You could've told me right away. I'm closing an old relationship. You have to be careful with those, they are the most dangerous. I too was once closing with a girl, and my ex caught me right at the end. Shit. Oh well, I'll let you have fun then. -Good evening. -Hey! I'm counting on you. I don't see, don't hear and don't speak. Okay, bye. Hey! So? -Did you pay for these two spritzes? -Yes. They crossed the line. I must say that I've never seen something like this. I mean, clearing out like this, without a warning. They clung to the collapsed wall excuse. Right, they seized the moment. You know, here, in these offices, it is full of people who can't wait to throw you all out. Yes, but we have done a lot of things, with our occupation. Both for the neighborhood and for the city. But they don't care. The neighborhood committees meet every other day to complain. Of you, of course. And they are the same who voted for the people here. Bastards. However... after making them look bad, because that's what happened... we have more strength in the negotiation, if you know what I mean. No, sorry, but concretely... What are you planning to do? I do not want to deceive you, but given the circumstances, I want to ask for the full regularization. And you think we have a chance? More than one. -I wish. -We'll see. What do I do, Pietro, do I have to come up? Not yet. Hello. Davide? He's with your mother. I couldn't find you. Ok, open up. Bye. I've sent my resume to Milan. Milan? Oh well, Milan is not that bad. You work hard. I mean, people from Milan are not the most funny there is, but... if you're happy. -Are you coming up? -I'm coming, Pietro. I heard about the police. Okay, so? We rejected them. We talked to the Municipality guy for the housing emergency, he says they will legalize us all, problem solved. Don't you want a better life for Davide? And you, to have this better life, take him away from me? Keep calm. Say you won't take Davide to Milan. Say it. I wouldn't want to do that. In the end, Pietro has come down. Oh, hi. Hey, Mohamed, who's in there? He's been in there for more than half an hour, what's his name... Jizhed. I see. Jizhed, even if you rub hard you won't get any whiter, you know? What now? What happened, Dad? Nothing, the light has gone out, now we'll get it back. Pietro! Pietro, what the fuck are you doing? I'll kill him, this Albanian. What's wrong, Mancini? What are you yelling for? "What's wrong?" I'm sure it's Pietro with his shitty experiments, like last time. Hey, it's not. Not at all, Pietro is sleeping. So wake him up, we have to solve this problem, come on. Come on, go wake him up. Mancini is always blaming Pietro, for everything. A tile falls, it's Pietro's fault. The elevator breaks, it's always Pietro's fault. Oh well, actually, last time you turned off the lights, Pietro. For five minutes. Just five. I had to try the elevator. Did you want to stay trapped inside? Sorry, huh? Come on, see what happened, so we can go to sleep. Come on, and please. Come on, let's go to sleep. Here everything is fine. Here everything is fine. -It's all right. -Right. And why is there no light? -I do not know. -You don't know? -I don't. -Hey, guys. I checked the transformer cabinet. The power went out, they just cut it off. There are the electrical company seals. No, not the seals, guys. I won't touch anything. Look, Pietro doesn't go to jail, I'm sorry. Don't look at me like that. -Hey, guys. -Hello. -How are you? -Fine, and you? -Very well. Come in. -Thanks. -Yo, Eagle. -Yeah. -Everything all right? -Yes. -Good. -Wow. -I didn't know you got a dog. -I am the dog. BEWARE OF THE DOG YOUR FATHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FREE MAN. IN 2003 YOU ARRIVED. I WAS READY TO TEACH YOU MY FREEDOM. -What are you laughing at? -Is he your son? -Guys, don't you give a damn? -No, here we are. STRENGTH AND HONOR. THE REST IS AIR AND DUST. TODAY YOU ARE 18. SHOW RESPECT FOR EVERYONE, BUT DON'T HUMBLE YOURSELF IN FRONT OF ANYONE! KEEP MAKING ME PROUD! BEST WISHES FLAVIO! Wow, beautiful. We've got chills, really. He turned 18 two days ago. I still haven't been able to give it to him. He should get a tumor in his nuts, the judge who took him away from you. And we pay them too, you know? They will have to repay you for everything sooner or later. Guys, it's not like I called you to be the political forum on communist magistrates. -We all think the same way. -Of course. I want to know one thing. Did you like it? -Fuck yes. It gives you the chills. -Yes, it is really beautiful. -It's really moving. -Just like a film. Beautiful. -Nice. -Really nice. It's very beautiful. Where's the meat? Come on, boss! -I'm so hungry. -You know, obviously from the police they say we leaked the news of the clearing out. -That's what they say? -Yes. But you know that lately I too have the feeling that... -I don't know, maybe it's just... -Here it is! -Oh! Beautiful. -Let's eat. -Oh yeah. -Ladies first, don't be a dick. -Do you want a sausage? -I know how to treat my wife. Guys, what about the godfather for the baby boy? -The godfather? -Yes. Well, there are a lot of thing to think about, still. Let's say you will know in due course. Hey, don't fuck around, guys, huh? The godparents must be the relatives. One yours and the other is Trisha's. This could be a problem. Because there aren't any blood relatives on your side anymore, right? Because the uncles you grew up with aren't uncles, but... -They're family friends, aren't they? -Right. I remembered well, then. Oh well, guys, if you insist we tell you. There is only one person who can be godfather to our daughter. -How nice! -A toast to the godfather! Thanks, guys. I love you. How nice. So, congrats for this beautiful little girl! Best wishes! -Thanks. -Thank you, guys. But it's a girl then, not a boy. I thought it was a boy. -You never understand shit. -Oh, come on, -I didn't know. -When it comes to sex, he gets confused. I mean, we've known for three months now. -Can't one go wrong? I was wrong. -Let's stop right here. You can go wrong once, but... Go away! Enough! Since you've been around, there's only drug dealing and filth! That's enough! We can't take it anymore! ITALIANS FIRST Let's try one thing. Now I ask you please to turn off all the lights, as a sign of solidarity for the residents of the building. Is it scary? It is the darkness towards which our city is heading. We are shutting down our rights, including the right to have a roof over our heads. Now turn them back on, go. Yup! And let's welcome Ivan Talarico on stage! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Go, Ivan! Thank you. I wanted to sing you this song that I wrote inspired by the letter that the residents of this building wrote to a person who apparently is very influential. Francesco, sorry if I call you by name But God is far away at least you stay close to me Francesco, excuse me for the familiarity But God is father, God is mother God is luminous absence Francesco, it's bad to write just for personal interest So I ask you: how are you? Is your family okay? How's the work going? Francesco, it is difficult to be the Pope But also to live with little money together with hundreds of families In an occupied building to which they have just disconnected the electricity And with the constant fear of being evicted, believe me it is not easy at all Francesco, they turned off the light And if God is light they have turned off God Francesco, they turned off the light And if God is light they have turned off God Sometimes God is electric light Sometimes God is hot water Sometimes God is a refrigerator Sometimes God is a radiator And if God is almighty why didn't he give everyone a home? And even if God sees everything Perhaps he has lost sight of this occupied building Because Rome is a big city, it is easy to get lost, even if you are God We can't take it anymore! Since you've been around, there's only drug dealing and filth! You scumbags! You have to go away! Good job! Defend them, these dirty gypsies, while we work our ass off all day every day to pay rent. They are only capable at eating and stealing. Hey! I'm talking to you. Look, I know that you and I are the same. I know you would beat them up too, these scumbags. Hit them with your club! What are you doing? Mom, relax. You have your things to do, when the light will be back in the building... Ma'am, really, don't worry. He's never here anyway, you can keep me company. Anyway, Daniel, you should call Eagle. It is not normal that they gave you two days of suspension for this. Three. Why, what happened? Nothing, a little argument at the demonstration. Don't worry, Mom. How are you? You see, Mom? We have an extra room. We can buy a comfortable bed, a large wardrobe, and you can stay as long as you want. You have to chill. You can't worry about everything. Of course not. I just worry that my mother is about to be homeless. I promised that if they turned me against my family, I would leave the riot unit. You were just a boy. Now you have your life, things change, it's normal. They changed badly, then. What time did he say? If Acea doesn't put the light back on by nine, they said they'd send someone. -But are you sure? -I don't know, Mancini. -Patience, Mancini. -You're the one to talk. -Sure. -You should've done this. Me? -Calm down, please, it's 9:15. -You are useless. -9:15. I'm sorry, gentlemen. My name is Father Krukouski, I am here on behalf of the Holy Father. Good evening. May I ask you the courtesy to take me to the transformer cabinet? -Of course. Come with me. -Go on, Pietro. -Let me shine a light, wait. -So, it's over... here. This is it. Hold this. It's in here. -Let's go. -All right. Be careful. Father, the right lever goes up and the left lever goes down. I know. In Poland I worked as an electrician for ten years. This is child's play. Done. -Thank you, Father! -Hurray! Thanks, Father. Thank you. -Hurray, thank you! Come on, guys, let's take a selfie. Yeah, let's do it. All behind me. Come on, let's take a picture. Mancini, come closer. Thank you so much, Father, truly. This is your home too, whenever you want, we are here. -Thank you, Father. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Thank the Holy Father, too. Yeah! We have light, guys! Yeah! Honey, your Mom asked if we wanna go to church with her on Sunday. What do you say? -Huh, honey? -I don't know, we'll see. She says they'll do a typical Camerun mass, with the traditional songs. Maybe we can meet with Patrick and Davide too, we haven't seen them in a long time. We hang out, take a walk. -The church is in the city center... -I'm busy. We'll talk later. You know? Your Mom told me about when you and Patrick were kids, the other day. She said that when you played in the yard kids made fun of you because you were a bit chubbier, so your brother had to... Enough with this bullshit! Fuck you, Daniel. Daniel. Mom. Come in. Sit. No, no. I just came to see how you were doing. Do you need something? I can go grocery shopping for you. -I can take the blanket... -No, Daniel, don't worry, it's all right. But Mom, you could have stayed a little longer, everything was fine. Can't you see the light is back? Yes, I can see the light is back. Come on, don't do that. Now I have to go around the floors. Come on, come with me. Will you come with me? Let's go. Valencia? Floors rounds. Valencia, open up, it's the committee. Here's Valencia. Come on in. Sorry, I forgot there were the floors rounds. All right here? House, windows... All good and nothing in order. Is it true that you will kick everyone out? -Is it true? -Valencia, have a good day. -Good day. -Bye, Valencia. Luca, floors rounds! Luca, open up, it's the committee. You have to do these rounds right now? Luca, these are the rules. Open up! Come on. Now I can't. I'm with my woman, come back later. Luca, like everyone else, you were warned that today there were the floors rounds. I said don't piss me off and come back later. -Hey, don't touch me. -Hey. Everybody keep calm. Look, if you don't let us in, we'll report you. Do you want to be permanently expelled? Expelled? They're gonna kick us out anyway. You whore. I'm sick of them. I can't take it anymore. What are you doing? Let him go! Come here, dickhead. Kneel. -Apologize to my mother, filthy gypsy. -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Fuck! What the fuck... Grab a piece of paper. So, gentlemen, to recap: Fiorentina-Udinese 1, Bologna-Sassuolo draw... This is my money. Go Napoli, don't forget. Always. Parma-Atalanta draw after the first half, Roma-Juventus under 2.5. Thanks, Maronna. Roma-Juventus, under 2.5. -Come on, Sultan. -What? -Give me this money, come on. -I don't give you shit. You played Roma-Juve under 2.5, they'll score three goals in the first half only. Sultan, what the fuck do you know about football? Give me this money, come on. -Give him the money. -Come on, or it's bad luck. Hey, Hot choc. Roxana bought sausages from the Castelli. She says if you don't come to lunch on Sunday, she'll be pissed off. All right. Hot choc. -Ten euros, come on. -No. Won't you play? -What's wrong with you, Hot choc? -Why? I don't know, you're weird. You're pale. Asshole. -Shush, or he'll get upset. -Fuck off. Hey, how are you? What do you mean? I'm fine. Word is you want to leave us. It's just that with the baby coming, between travel and overtime... -So? -So, Eagle... With our job, I'm afraid that she'll grow up without me even understanding when the fuck that happened. Listen. Do you remember the speech I gave you when you arrived in the unit? Yes. What did this speech say? That this is not a unit like the others. That the riot unit is a family. Exactly. It is a family. And then? That my brother's problem, is my problem. And vice versa. You say it would be a mistake, huh? You are good at this job. Remember that. Go rest, go. Send Sultan here. I used to come here as a child with Uncle Daniel. Only those who know this building well, know that it exists. Come here. Come, don't fear. Go, get up. Easy. Careful. Don't worry, it's nothing. Go. Hey, watch out. Watch out for the wire. -Impressive, huh? -Yes. Have you seen how high we are? Well, they say that in Milan they have good opportunities, jobs... Really, Davide, I don't doubt that. But do you think you can see a sunset like this in Milan? I don't know, I've never been there. Me neither. But for sure in Milan you can't get a sunset like this, trust me. When we were building the Colosseum, they were still swinging clubs. The people who are born here, are born rich, remember that. But Dad, if they take you away can we come back to see the sunset anyway? -Sweetheart, who's gonna take me away? -Uncle Daniel. Then you didn't understand anything about Uncle Daniel. He pretends to be against us, but he actually is on our side. Uncle Daniel is undercover. Hey. This is a secret, though, you must not tell anyone. -Swear. -I swear. What should we do with these holiday homes? Unfortunately, the proposal to avoid the eviction and to... and to legalize your occupation did not find much support. Mayor, police, and the Province wouldn't hear a thing. There is a date. November 15th. On November 15, the building must return to its legitimate ownership. Yes, but we invited the mayor, Marson. He didn't even reply, we only spoke with you. What is the result? That you are treating us like parcels? It is not easy. There are a number of coefficients in the evaluation. I mean, it's hard to explain. On the contrary, in the negotiation, having obtained 204 beds for one year for the occupants, is a good result, in my opinion. Yeah, a good result, right. But what can we tell the other occupants? That they've been buggered by a series of coefficients? Look, what if we refuse to leave? Have you ever been to Valleranello? It would've been better if they'd sent us to Reggio Calabria. Even for the others who have been left out, it is likely that they will be included in next year's housing plan. It's something I can commit myself to do. Sorry... I'm a practical man. Practically, what are we getting here? In Valleranello, for a year, there are 204 beds ready for use. Obviously, women, old people and children take precedence. 152 people are left out. Yeah, right. Let's go. Thank you for a shitty job, Marson. Mom, I'm sorry for what happened the other day. When I saw you hit that boy, I thought, "No, this isn't my Daniel." I know. I'm sorry. They say they'll take us to a residence in Valleranello. So? Where's the problem? Here in San Giovanni I have my whole life. My friends, I walk to church. And that Valleranello is not a good place for me. Mom, you don't have to listen to what Patrick, Mohamed and all that gang are telling you. The Municipality has found a solution. It will not be the best one, but it's still a solution. It's not about Patrick. Mom, if you continue to stay in that house, you won't get anything. We could've found an agreement, pay a small rent to the owner of the building, or pay for electricity, I don't know... This is Patrick's idea, right? I mean... pay the rent of the occupied house. A brilliant idea! Just brilliant. You don't have to fret like that. It's not good for you. And then with your job... Mom, it's not about my job, it's about you who don't want to listen. When it comes to Patrick, it's always like that. Patrick says to do something? Done. Patrick decides to do that? Done. Always everything to please Patrick. At least he's not pretending he doesn't have a family. For the municipality, we can already take the keys to the new apartments. All settled, right? Good news, all solved. Those like me, those who are not entitled to a residence, may find a solution. But I want to ask you something. What will happen a year from now? Now we are together, we are united. But in a year, when the residence contracts expire, what will happen? Let me tell you. It's everyone against everyone again. One against the other. Pietro against Mancini, Mancini against Mohamed, Mohamed against Viviana and Viviana against me. -Quite right. -United we are strong. Divided we are weak. They throw us out like garbage. They can come with tanks, with armored vehicles, with the whole army, but we've been here for 16 years and we won't move. If we have resisted once, we can resist again. -Yes! -Bravo! Yes! Okay, okay, but let's return to order now, please. Raise your hand if you are in favor of the municipality's proposal. -No... -Mancini, go home. No, no... that's okay. But now, raise your hand if you are against the proposal of the Municipality and want to resist the eviction! -Yes! -Come on! Yeah! Don't worry, Mom, we'll solve everything. You should call your brother. What for? -Yo, Nuccio. -Hi, Eagle. -Everything okay? -I'm fine. Anyway, for me we are coming back strong and tough. In the end, history is made up of cycles. What the fuck are you saying, Nuccio? -Damn you. -Nuccio, did you say cycles? You didn't even get a diploma and you're talking about cycles? What the fuck, can't I even have my own idea for you? Of course you can, but it's wrong. Or at least, if you want to be consistent and keep thinking about past times, then you don't have to fuck niggas. Yes, but you do fuck your black girl, huh? She's not black. She is Romanian. European Community. Moron. Here we go again. Anyway, speaking of immigrants, a couple of weeks ago, down at the police station, I've seen your little friend. -That nigga. -Who, Hot choc? -Hot choc. -Who? The black riot cop, don't you know? -There is a nigga in the riot unit? -Oh, yeah. Shut up. And what was he doing at the police station? I don't know. He came to get another nigga like him. We had pinched them down in San Giovanni, during the clearing out. Some sort of relative. Eagle, maybe you didn't understand. They buttfuck you and you don't even notice it. Nuccio, shut the fuck up! I know if I have a son of a bitch or a good guy in front of me. Eagle, listen to your friends. You must never trust those people. In the precinct word is you like to take it in the ass. Should I believe it? Eagle, then do the fuck you want. Come on, guys, don't fight. Yes, it's more expensive, actually, but consider that if you remove the sides, it becomes a cot, so it's a deal. What do you think, shall we take it? Daniel? -Daniel! -Huh? Tell me. Look, if you have to be like this, call him. -Who? -Patrick. Look, let's take this. It's beautiful, perfect. You call him and ask him if he can make the assembly change their mind. Listen, love, I did what I had to do. I switched shifts. It's not my problem anymore. Let's go, come on. Go inside. Klo, tell me you're kidding. What did you expect? You're destroying a family, you know? Solve at least half of your mess, Patrick, then maybe something will change. What mess, Klo? Where will Davide sleep after the eviction, huh? -In your car? -Again with this story. If they wanted to evict us, they would have already done so, trust me. Do you know why I stayed in Rome? Yo, Hot choc! What's wrong with you tonight, huh? You're so wimpy... There he is! Are you hitting me? Listen, is it true that your mother was a whore in Africa? Where the fuck are you going? You know what? I would have liked to give her a taste of my club. Stop it! Stop! That's enough! For fuck's sake, I said enough! What the fuck are you doing? Go fuck yourself at home! Fuck you, are you deaf? You shut up, too! I've seen the clearing out shifts, you're not with us tomorrow. No, because Trisha has an ultrasound and I wanted to be there. What are you, a nurse or a riot cop? Tomorrow we're in deep shit. I need as many men as possible. Yes, but... Believe me, if I had an alternative I wouldn't even have asked you. Thanks, Daniel. -Here they come! -Here comes the shit! Ten, one hundred, one thousand occupations! Let's put the masters inside the barracks! Ten, one hundred, one thousand occupations! Let's put the masters inside the barracks! Come on, guys. I want you ready. Scumbags! Pieces of shit! Minions of the State! Formation! Formation! Scumbags! -There is no more time. -All this haste is a bit suspicious. -Get them out. -But look at what you have done. -They have to go out. -But look at this. The units are deployed, I can't wait any longer, okay? Why won't you listen to me? It's a mess. How can I get them out? There will be a carnage if they stay. Look at what you have done. Guys, clear them out. Formation! Come on! Go, go, go! Charge! Come on, guys, let's go! Stay close together! Come on, let's take them all! Don't let them escape! -Move forward! -Go! Come on, guys! Hey! Come with me! Come on, let's open this door. -Fuck. Get him out of here! -I see nothing! -Come on, guys! -Inside! Let's go! -Go up! -Come on! -Don't stop! -Watch out! -Come on, let's go upstairs! -Fuck! Come on, come on! -Be careful! -Careful, guys! Keep going up! Go, go, go! Let's go! Careful! -Move, for fuck's sake. Let's go! -Go up! -Come on, guys! -Keep going! Fuck! Ok, guys, listen! First and second unit on the floors the rest with me. -Let's go! -Come here! Sorry. You asshole! You bastard, let me go. -Shut up! -You can't get me out of here! Mom? Hey! We have to go upstairs. Move! Let me go! -What are you taking about? Fuck you! -Assholes! What did I do? Let me go! -What the fuck do you want? -Shut up! -What did I do? - Shut up and walk! Fuck you. Patrick is on the roof. Hey, what did she tell you? Do you know her? No. Come on, guys, let's get to it. Stop! Stop. There is someone on the roof threatening to jump. So? And so we wait for the commissioner's orders. Move. Viviana, move, we're not playing. -Move. -Holy shit. -We are on the seventh floor. Come down! -You too, move. -Be careful here. -I saw it, move. Sir, can I talk to you for a moment? Come with me for a moment, come. Come, sir. Listen to me carefully. In my career I have done more than 200 evictions. There's always someone who threatens to jump down, but then nothing happens. Trust me. Domenico, I don't want injured people on my conscience. People like us never give up! People like us never give up! People like us, people like us... People like us never give up! People like us, people like us People like us never give up! It's a mess. I can't do it. Sir, listen to me. The sooner we clear out, the sooner this circus ends. We are ready. He doesn't have the guts to do it. People like us, people like us People like us never give up! Okay, got it. The situation below is out of control. Either we leave or we attack. A decision has to be made. There is no more time, sir. What are the orders? You have to tell me what the orders are, sir! -Let's break through. -It took you long enough. Come on, guys. Sultan, open the door. Daniel? -Shame on you. -Where are you going? -Where do you want to go? -Move away! -You must be ashamed! -Stop! Hey! Look. Stop! Don't come any closer or I'll jump. Come down. I told you to go away! Don't come any closer. -Listen to reason! -Don't come closer! The building is cleared out, it's over. What are you talking about? This is my home! You cleared out your own house, asshole! For the last time, come down! Go fuck your... Charge! Charge! Hey, Hot choc! Stop! Let me go! You have to let me go! Get up. Come on. I didn't do a thing. All right!
