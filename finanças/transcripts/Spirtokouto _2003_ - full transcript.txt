A film by Yannis Economides Linda, where's Vangelis? Get him. It's Dimitris. Vangelis, why's she picking up the phone? Let it ring. Let it ring, man. What've I said, Vangelis? I don't want her to. Let it ring! How's it going there? Go to the kitchen cabinet and get the invoice folder. Yes, the red one! Good, open it. Look for the coffee invoice. I don't have it here, asshole! Would I call you if I did? Take a good look! That's it. No, don't tell me on the phone. Bring it here to me! Nicoletta will stay. Why didn't she show up? M A T C H B O X I'm still on the line. When she shows up, pay her for last night. And tell her never to set foot in there again! I'm good-looking too, but I get to work on time! Vangelis, cut the crap! We're talking business here. Know how many like her there are in Korydalos? Tons of them looking for work! Fire her! 'Cause I said so! Vangelis, cut the crap! This is business, you idiot! It's settled! Nicoletta's through. End of story! Be here in 10 minutes. Let Linda clean and be here with the invoice. Under the register... there's the air-condition repair guy's card. Bring it. No, don't give me the number on the phone. I said bring it with you. Be here in ten. In five! Be here in five! Fix the goddamn thing. Fix it! You fan yourselves with papers, for fuck's sake? You doing this on purpose, man? It's summer! When are you gonna fix it? Christmas? Christmas, Easter, when I feel like it! -What's it to you? -I'm drenched! The other day I said to Eva and Michalis... "Let's go over for a beer." They said, "In that oven? We'll die in there." They're right. Don't come over. Tell us if you don't want us, man. Don't torture us. Yorgos, did you come to talk about the air-conditioner? I have work to do. The invoices are piled up. Want to lend a hand? If not, get out and let me work! I'm telling you I can't sleep. I keep thinking... about this business. I don't know, I don't see it. My instinct tells me not to go through with it. It's a lot of money. When do we get it back? We've been over that, Yorgos. It'll be fine. We see how it goes. We'll be fine. -I'm scared, man. I'm scared... -Don't be scared! Ever lose anything with me? Did I ever steer you the wrong way? No, man. It's just a totally different field. It's like knowing cotton and moving to artichokes. We learn about artichokes! What do we know about chefs, grocers, butchers... They could end up taking us for a ride. I'll worry about that! Listen, man, we know about coffees, beer, nuts. We know those tricks. So we stick to coffee our whole life, pathetic slob? We don't do anything else with our lives? You think of this at fifty? A hundred-fifty! Why? Are we retiring? -We went over this! -So we go over it again! I said we should do a taverna with guitar. -A cafeteria again, I dig that. -We made up our minds! We talked about it a million times, asshole! There's no place in Korydalos like this. No piano bar like the one I'm talking about. There isn't. 'Cause no one's stupid enough to open one! Tablecloths, flowers and shit. Only you thought of it. You idiot! Now you tell me this? Didn't you tell me last week we go ahead? I gave the deposit, arranged for the loan. We went over this. It'll be the best restaurant. Don't spoil this before we even start. Who's gonna come to your posh place in Korydalos? Everyone, Yorgos! From every corner of Athens. Don't bust my balls, over and over. -I don't know, my instinct... -Fuck your instinct! Where has your instinct ever led you? Nowhere. It led you to me and I made a man of you! Count me out. You're backing out? Selling me out, you fuck? Do it yourself! Don't mix me up in this stuff. I'll stick to coffee. Fuck you, then! You can't even do that! -Do it yourself, man. -I will, you piece of shit! I think about our kids. I see farther ahead than you. -You can't see past your nose! -Go fix your air-conditioner! And you want a posh restaurant! Get outta here! You come and and spring this shit on me now? -Piss off, asshole! -I don't know business? Loser! I made a name for you here and you complain! I made you! You should be kissing my hand! We even gave you our sister, made you family... Shut up, Yorgos! Sit down now! Keep the shouting in your house, not here. Get it? -Alright, Maria. -The kids are still asleep. Alright, Maria. It's over. Telling me all this shit now... -Come on, Dimitris. -Don' t give me that. Didn't we shake on it, for fuck's sake. Who is it? Come on up. -Who is it? -Vangelis. Now that he's here, talk to him. -About what? -Linda. -Fine. -No, fine! Talk to him. Alright. No problem. -Morning, Dimitris. -Come on in. This it? -Should I go? -Grab a seat. -What's up, Yorgos? -The usual. Sit down, man! -He fired the babe. -Get outta here! He called before. She wasn't there so he got rid of her. -You got her number? -Yeah, I got it. What an asshole. What happened? You threw Nicoletta out? -She's a good one. -She was great, man. Hard-working, smart, quick... The only nice girl we had in there and we get rid of her? Leave your nose alone. Take a tissue! What are you going to do about Linda, Vangelis? -What? -That's what I'm asking. Nothing. Just take her to a doctor I know for an abortion. If she doesn't want to get rid of it, it's not my fault. Why wouldn't she? She's had one before. She's scared. Her friends tell her if she has another one... she won't be able to have kids, shit like that. -Bullshit. -Of course it is. Bitches. Why not settle down, Vangelis? You're 27-28 already. Get married to Linda. She's a nice girl. Yeah. Two years work with us, we never had a reason to complain. Hard-working, always on time, neat, honest... sweet, always smiling, with her "yes sirs", pretty. She's a real piece of ass, not just pretty. What're you talking about? I'm not ready for that. Why aren't you ready? Come on, I can't take care of a dog let alone a family. I'll take care of you. Haven't I always? -I've always been there. -We're always there. Do what's right. You make good money, so does she. Yeah, sucker. It all goes in your pocket. What're you saying? Marry the Albanian? Albanian or not, she's a fine girl. I checked her out. So what? I'm supposed to marry her now? Why not? -Marry the Albanian! -Seen your face lately? You gonna lecture me on the Albanians? I know what a shitty breed they are. Linda's different. She's one of us. What're you talking about, Dimitris? What if all her people come down? What do I do with all those Albanians in my house? Your family any better? Her father's educated. A teacher. -Teacher, my ass... -So what... -Linda cleans our bathrooms. -She'll clean yours, too. Marry her already! Maybe she'll stop her whining. Quit it, Yorgos! What's the problem? Like you had better women in the past? They were sluts. Sluts or not, they weren't Albanians. -Would you marry her? -You think we're the same? Asking me that... Give us a break, man. And what am I? I get stuck with her? How will I show my face in the street with an Albanian? Please! If my mother finds out, she'll have a stroke. Like you care about your mother all of a sudden. She'd be glad if you took a girl like her. You act like you know the baby's mine. -I'm sure it is. -How? -Linda told me. -What if she did? -I believe her. -You do? What if she told you Lukas was the father? Then Lukas would be sitting where you are. Well I'm not getting stuck with some baby! That's final! What do you mean "some baby"? I mean it's not mine, Dimitris! We were together for 2 months. I screwed her 6 times tops! All it takes is once, asshole! And where was I? Wasn't I there? You take me for a fool? Wouldn't I have noticed? Maybe the kid's not his. It's definitely not! Remember two days after me... that sleazy guy picking her up on his moped! Yeah. The cunt had barely broken up with him... -Cut it out! -You think she only had me? She even hit on me. How do I know whose it is? She screwed everybody! Raise someone else's kid? Vangelis, I'll be there for you. Do what's right. That's what I'm doing. I took her aside as a friend. I told her not to be afraid. I said I'd take her to a clinic, to a doctor I know... I offered to lend her money. What more can I do? We should send her before she bloats up. Then, we're fucked. We'll be paying maternity leave, for diapers and shit. She'll sit home and we'll be sending her paycheck over. We ain't raising Linda's bastard. Get out with that slut! Get up! Get up I said! He told you to get up! Get out of here! Split. Beat it, man! You deaf? Scram! Get out of here! Shit! Vangelis is a good guy. He'll work it out. Fuck me, man. -What is it now? -The usual. -Still? -Still. -Was it a bad fight? -All hell broke loose. It's her fault, man. Give us a break, Babis! How do you think I feel, asshole? Remember what time we got back last night? Do you know what time it is now? Know what time it is? The old man fucks me over. He works me like a fucking slave, the cocksucker. Like a fucking slave... Work, work, from the crack of dawn, man. Work, work, asshole, from dawn. The asshole works me to death. Give us a break, jerk! Can't he drop dead so we can live in fucking peace? Can't he drop dead, the fucking cocksucker? It's like the fucking army! What do we have that hick for? To drink coffee and fuck Linda? I'm gonna split one of these days, fucking split. I swear to fucking God, I'm gonna split. I don't give a fuck about the old man. Fuck you, too. We'll talk tonight, man. How the fuck do I know? How the fuck do I know? I don't know! She might be there. I'm so bored with her, man. You and fucking Angela. Fuck Angela, man. What's your fucking problem? You hot for her, man? You hot for Angela, man? Tell me, asshole. Babis! You wanna fuck her, man? You horny? Like Kiki knows what she's doing. Let them get married. She wants him. If it wasn't for me in here, they'd all be dead, damn it! With the brains your sister and my daughter have? You should've set them straight. "Two black-headed snakes, that's what they fed me..." Like Kiki knows what she's doing. The three of us tonight, man. You get it? You, me and Angela, man. The three of us tonight, man. Wanna get laid, fool? Yeah, jerk, I'll talk her into it. You wanna get laid, don't you? So what if she's my babe? Don't you get it? You should come on her, man. Fuck you, asshole! You deaf, man? The whole neighborhood heard me. I'd do it for you. Yeah, I'm a good person, man. I'm a really good person, man. Only for you, Babis. I'll talk her into it, man. You're a fucking pussy, man. Why don't you go jerk off, faggot? No, you can't, asshole. I don't want to now. No fucking way, asshole. I'll ask Takis. Takis is no pussy. Huh, pussy? He's not a pussy. The guy's loaded, pal. You think I forgot who his fucking father is? That fag? We got him elected and instead of kissing my feet, -he wouldn't get us a permit. -Almost sucked our dicks. He wanted a kick-back from me! I've been here my whole life. Everybody knows me. -He got shit from me. -He got shit. I'll let his scum marry my daughter? Don't let him in our family. That 40 year old clown wants my Kiki. He's old. He's filled her head with stories. -A gentleman of leisure. -Gentleman of leisure, my ass. -What does he do? -Scratches his balls all day. Got everything from his Dad. Never worked a day. I bet he doesn't have a single social security stamp. Not like us working our asses off. Hey, did we buy this month's stamps? -You asking me? -I'll go tomorrow. She's so hot, man. I trained her. She's hot, man! She swallows. She swallows, man! You take care of the house, I got the car and the broad. I'll bring a couple of lines. Your family? What're you talking about! Are you kidding me? Send them to the village. Don't even talk to me, Babis! I changed my mind. Send them somewhere, idiot. To the village! I have to beg you to get laid? OK, relax, man. Babis, get with it! Atta boy! That's more like it! Now listen, shower! You stink, man, You reek. You stunk up all of Korydalos. Shower! You stink like a skunk. Like a skunk, man. Get with it, Babis... at 11 o'clock. Yes, yes. I'll come by at eleven. We got her, man, we got her. We got her, man. Bye now, bye... I'm out of here. What about our business? We have to make a decision. -I'll think about it. -No more thinking, Yorgos. Alright, Dimitris. We'll discuss it tonight. We can discuss it a million times. Let's just not repeat the same things over and over. Ok, we'll talk at the shop. We'll go over everything. Where are you going now? The beach. I promised Michalis. Eva wants to go, too. -Go get some sun. -Please, what a drag. The beach in the middle of the day. Fuck it. Good-bye, Maria. Maria, bye! -Nothing? Not a bit? -What? Nothing? -No shame at all? -What is it, Maria? Aren't you ashamed? You dare to ask? -What'd I do? -What were you talking about? What were the two of you talking about? -Nothing. -You're lying. -We were just talking. -Watch what you say! -We talked about business. -Shall I tell you then? Tell you what, Maria? It was business. Whispering behind my back? You take me for a fool? Just wait! We didn't say anything. You're lying! You talked about me and the kids. Alright! So what? What did you say about me to that fool? Nothing. A few words. -Tell me then. -I said we had problems. -And that Maria's what? -What do you want? -An apology. -What for? For insulting me in my own house! To a stranger! -He's your brother! -And you're my husband! Burying me behind my back! I forbid you to talk about me! Got it? I can't talk in my own house? No, you can't. You can't put down your family. You're pathetic! -Fine, I'm sorry! -You can do better. -I said I'm sorry! -Say it normally. It's over. Dimitris, apologize to me calmly, normally, like a man. I'm sorry. Margarita stinks. -What? -She stinks! -What do you mean? -I can't bear it! -What now? -I'm dying in here! -Be patient. She'll leave. -I can't breath. I wanna puke! She's your cousin. I don't give a shit. Do something. What can I do? Throw her in the sea. I don't know. Shut up already! I don't know what you're gonna do, just do something! Aren't you the man of the house. The cock of the house? Put your mind to work and do something! Fine, I will. -What? -I don't know. Something! Don't you smell it? No, I don't. Leave me alone! I can't take this! I've got invoices to do! Fuck the invoices. What are you going to do? You're making me crazy. Don't you get anything? Busting my balls with this crap? You put her in my bed. I'm sleeping with this stinker. I breath in this stench and you call it crap? Is that crap to you? Alright, it's not. I didn't mean it. Don't say things you don't mean. I'll change her room. Enough! I don't know if it's enough, Dimitris. Don't you get anything? Leave me alone! We're opening the store! You are. What do I care? -I'm doing this for us. -You're doing it for yourself. All these months, not once did you ask my opinion. You live here. You hear the discussions. You offered an opinion and I didn't listen? That's not what I'm saying! Why didn't you ask me? I don't count for anything? So what is it? You really don't give a damn about me? Ok, I didn't think of it. You bet! I thought we agreed. You have a different view? Your idea's rubbish. You're gonna fail big time. You don't know anything! Don't you see? You've made a fool of yourself. The whole family's laughing at you. Korydalos doesn't need a piano to sing. It sings all by itself! -Bullshit! -Watch it, Mitsos! Well, I'm doing it! You're all going against me on purpose. You're pitiful! You were born a coffee house man and you'll die one. When you fall, I'll be there. When you fall flat on your face, I'll be there. I'll be there watching you! Was it you who changed the other one's mind? You told him this? Yorgos agrees? His mind's working. Now his mind's working? Before he was an idiot. -Yes. -Give us a break! I'm listening to you break my balls! Oh, you have balls? -And everything else! -Let's see them. -Everyone will see them! -Go on, then! You'll fucking see them! I'll show you! I'll open the store and you'll be kissing my balls! Who's in there? Come on, Lukas! You still in there? Finish up! Goddamn it. Finish up, Lukas! Get out or I'll break the door. Then I'll break your skull! Finish up, Lukas! Get out or I'll break the door down! Finish up! -Just a second! -A second? I've been screaming for fifteen minutes! Get out of there and give someone else a chance! Go on, get out! Wait! What the fuck do you mean "wait"? Get out or I'll really hit the roof! Finish up, Lukas! This fucking house! -What? -What're you doing in there! -What do you want? -To shit! On you, your mother, the whole world! Drop that face! Get dressed. I'm going to the shop with you. -You are? -Yes, I'm going with you. -Get dressed! -Alright. You better be ready by the time I shave, Lukas! And drop that smart-ass look! Or I'll smash your face, no-good loser! I'll smash your face! When I see it go round and round, I get dizzy. He doesn't want the roulette to spin. How else will we play the game, Zapata? I didn't know you were a dealer. Please, Miss, don't distract the dealers. The roulette goes around and around... and we stop it where we want it to stop. Did you take your pill? -No. -Take it. May God repay you. We're leaving. Get down! Get down! We're leaving! Shut up and listen to what I'm telling you! Shaking your ass on top of the bar! You slut, you nearly wrecked the place with your fat ass! You drank the shot. You shouldn't have, Katerina. Just because that asshole bought it for you. Leonidas may be an asshole but I'm the one who handles him. Why did you drink it? 'Cause you're a slut, that's why! Leonidas gives you one bit of attention... and you almost pull your pants down, bitch! What do I do with it now? Sorry's half the insult. You shouldn't have done it, Katerina. You don't do this to Kiki. Where the hell is he? No man's gonna look at you. Go find the Paki at the corner gas station. He'd fuck you with that face. Do you realize what a pig you are? Go fix your face, slut, then go out! I'll give you money for plastic surgery. Fix your face and lift your tits and ass. Shit face! Swallow your teeth, bitch, then go out and shake it. You double-cross Kiki? You're finished! Go hide out at your Mom's convenience store. And never come out, you little cunt! I'm supposed to pity you? All choked up? Drown in your tears! Cry yourself to death! I'll come dance all over your grave. You hear that? You're pathetic! Know what else? All night after you left, Leonidas and I laughed our heads off and his friend said... "Where'd you find that ugly hag? She's so gross... She's a joke." Get it? You're trash. My shoes. Right now! You've had them for a month. Go drop them off now at the store. And I never want to see you again. You'll turn the other way when you see me in the street. -Fuck off. -Sit your ass down! How can you talk to your friends that way? What's all this shit about Leonidas? Didn't I say I don't want you seeing him? What did I say? It's over with Leonidas. That lazy ass, fool! It's over! You never see so much as a picture of him! Not even in your dreams! Understand? I'll tear your eyes out! I'll tear your hair out! What the fuck is wrong with you? -Go to your room! -Put a leash on that psycho! Raising his hand to me! Things will get ugly, Kiki! You do what I say! -Psycho! -Leonidas is gone, dead! This story's over. You dirty little slut! Go to hell! It's over! Get it straight in your head! You all do as I say! That's final! You wanted to see my balls! Words don't do any good! -You trying to kill us? -The tables are turned! -You trying to kill us! -I'll fuck you over! Come on then! Come on, Mr. Cool! You want a medal or something? -What do you want, Margarita? -Stop fighting! Go back to your room! I'll fucking kill you. You're half a woman. Good for nothing. You should be burned at the stake, bitch! You scratch your ass all day long, slut! You can't even raise two kids properly! From now on, I take over! Kiki will do as I say. I'm her father and she is obligated to do as I say! -I'm her father! -Like hell you're her father! Only I know who her father is. Only me! Kiki's not your child! She's not your daughter! I had her with someone else! Look at it! Look at it! Kiki is not your child! You've been raising someone else's kid all these years! Remember, that time in Crete? Remember? You wanted me to go on vacation alone? I did! And I had a good time! A really good time! -What do you want now? -I can't find my glasses! Where were you all day? I've been looking for you. Your cell's turned off? Why do you carry it? Dimitris is gone. He flipped! He flipped, I'm telling you. It was a madhouse, mayhem! He went crazy. He was slamming doors, banging walls. He fought with Lukas. He slapped Kiki. He tried to strangle her. For real. He's deranged! He grabbed Kiki by the hair... and dragged her across the floor. Do you believe it, Yorgos? What do you mean, calm down? Then he went for me, Margarita got in the middle. He cussed her out. He tried to grab Margarita. Do you believe it? He had a crazy look in his eyes. He left crazy. I don't know. On the one hand, I never want to see him again. On the other, he's the father of my children, my husband. He had a crazed look in his eyes! I've never seen him like that. I got scared! He went mad, raving mad! I'm scared. I'm scared of him. Me and the kids. I was terrified today. Today he blew this house apart. He blew my house apart! The man's out of his mind. Call me. How could he say those things? -Move it. -I stink? He stinks! Move it, Margarita! Acting nice all those years. "Come stay with us." Forget it! It was his idea for me to stay here. -We'll miss the bus! -Talking behind my back! My God! Stop your babbling! I figured him out but I didn't want to believe it. Take the blood pressure gauge! -My robe! -Where is it? I had it here! Put it in there. -He'll see who I am! -Don't leave a single knicker! Son of a bitch! Did they find him? I hope they never do! He stinks 10 times worse than me! Not again. You're taking forever! I'm ready! Let's go! Telling me I stink! To hell with him! Let's get out of here! Praise the Lord! -Get your hands off me! -Dimitris, what's wrong? They've got us surrounded! Do you know what war is? Just hold on. Dead bodies everywhere! Cut off heads! What's going on here? Cut off legs, cut off hands, spilled brains! What's gotten into you? -Do you know what war is? -Please let me go! They don't say please in a war! They fight! Alright! -You're going like this? -Let me go, I said! Calm down! -We're at war! Say it. -Fine. -Say it! -War! -Louder! -War! War! Get me a beer! -Forget the beer, Dimitris. -Get a beer! -No more. -Beer! -Alright! -That's my boy! Where are you going? You leaving? I'm not staying here another minute! -Where's the beer? -Let go. You bum! Get out of our way! You talking to me, bitch? I'll fucking kill you! Dirty, two-faced, hypocrite! Fucking Northerner! I'll tear you to pieces, bitch! You destroyed the girl! Get out of my way, man! Bastard, asshole, faggot! What's the matter with all of you? Calm down. -You talking to me, whore? -Fuck you and your store! -I'll slit your throat! -Shut up! Die asshole! Whores! Bitches! Out! Out! Get off of me! Out you bitches! Out you bitches! -Out of my house, bitches. -They're gone! -Fuck you, sluts! -Stop it. Sit down! Come in! -Hit the road, whores! -It's not them. Cut it out! They're gone! -Get out! -Stop it! They're gone, suitcases and all! Calm down. Talk to me, man. Tell me you're okay. Tell me you're okay! You sit down! What happened to him? Vangelis! Out! Out! Get out of here, you bitches, you sluts! Stop it now! They're gone. Snap out of it. Look at me, man. Lukas! Asshole, you've been here the whole time? Don't you hear what's going on down here? Sluts... serpents... out you bitches. Are you going to tell me what happened? What do you want, huh? Stop asking what happened! Jesus fucking Christ! Don't you see what they've done to him? Can't you figure it out? Why don't you ask him if you want to know! Find out. Say, "Mr. Dimitris, what happened here? " See if he answers you. Find out if he can talk to you! Don't ask me one more thing! Mr. Dimitris, are you alright? He's fine! Aren't you, Mitsos? He's alright. Like a rock. Don't give in to those whores. Mr. Dimitris... What are you doing to my father? What am I doing? -Speak up! -Are you crazy? Why are you yelling now? Keep out of it. I'm talking to Angela. Tell me! What are you doing? -You hitting on him? -Are you insane? Asshole, can't you see your father? -Yeah, he's fine. -This is fine? You all made him this way. Hovering like vultures... He just needs air. Instead of worrying about your father, fool... you give us this bullshit? Who made you in charge here? You're one to talk, drinking the man's blood. -You hick! Ass-licker! -Fuck you, prick! Talking to your boss like that? I feed you, man. Eat this, man! You're no fucking boss! Vangelis, stop! You'll starve. You'll be begging me, man. I'll fuck you! I'll crash your fucking skull. You stay out of this! Get out all of you, now! Fuck you, little prick! What're you looking at, asshole? I said get out. -You alright, Dimitris? -Hey, stupid clod! Hick! Villager! Beat it, asshole! Get out of my house, asshole! Have a cigarette. Let the man breathe. Hey, shepherd, hick, fucking hillbilly! Go back to your fucking village. Out, you prick! Get out of my fucking house! What happened? What happened in here? Maria called me. OK I don't care. But just tell me what happened. Look at you, man! Shut that damn thing off. What happened? -Look at you. -Do you trust women? Fuck that. What happened here? -Do you trust them? -Forget that. Talk to me. She went nuts on the phone. -Do you trust them? -I know when to be careful. -Do you trust Eva? -Eva's my wife. So, you trust her? Don't I trust my own wife? What's all this shit? I mean because her name is Eva. Eve, the apple, the snake. You know what I mean? What does that have to do with my wife? -Her name is Eva! -Leave her out of this! -Maria didn't tell you? -Tell me what? Do you all know something and you're not telling me? What about Michalis? Still taking guitar lessons? -Learning his little songs? -Yes he is. That hunk still coming over teaching him do, re, mi? What's this about my family? Do you know something? Something going on behind my back? He comes around on that huge bike... and parks outside your house, sucker! Watch it, Dimitris! You can't say that about my wife and kid. I'll kill you, man. Well, look at Yorgos now. You've turned yellow like a lemon. What's wrong? Didn't your instinct tell you anything? Fuck that! What went on here! Are you putting me on? Can you swear that Michalis is your son? What's this about my wife and son? Yes, I can swear! -Can you prove it? -I can prove it! How? -With a DNA test. -Go ahead, sucker. You're out of your mind. My sister's right. Go pull yourself together! Go back to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom and pull yourself together! Come on, boy. Snap out of it! "And they give her to my enemy..." "for the spite I call my own." Calm down, man! "They invite me to their wedding," "and call me their best man." Calm down, man. It's over! "So I can wed them, and unite them..." Please, man! "I hold the wreath of gold, and my heart of old..." Mitsos, calm down! "but there can be no trust!" "There can be no trust!" Please, Mitsos. "Upon this flower of the dead, I lay down to rest my head." -Kiki! -What? -Come in here and help. -I'm leaving. -He's a mess. -I know. Mom told me everything. What do you want from me? Stay here with him! I have to go. I can't. Leonidas is waiting downstairs. Fuck Leonidas! Stay here! You stay, Uncle. I'm leaving! He's your father! I don't want to help him. Get it? -He's a mess! -I don't care! -Don't you hear him? -Sounds fine. He's singing. What the hell do you mean he's a mess? When's your mother coming back? Come on, Mitsos. It's over now. How'd you end up like this? Why, Mistos, why? "See the tide we must, there can be no trust." Together! "There can be no trust." -My brother. -Calm down. "Upon this flower of the dead, I lay down to rest my head." Please, man. Calm down. What just happened? What was that? What got into you? Why all this? Tell me. Nothing happened. Nothing? The shit hit the fan. Why? Why all this? Tell me. -Bullshit! -What bullshit? Tell me why this happened? Yorgos... fuck it. Nothing happened. OK, fine, don't tell me if you don't want to. I'll be at the store. If you need anything, call. Did you really mean those things you said about Eva? Just tell me that... Please. No. Yorgos... We'll open a cafeteria. Fuck it. Maria. If that's how it was, why didn't we end this years ago? Any similarity with actual persons is purely coincidental.
