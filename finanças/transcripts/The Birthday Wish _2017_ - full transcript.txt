Insurance. Take one. Marker. And... action. Three, two, one... Happy New Year! Insure the unexpected. Assurance global insurance. And... cut! Tail slate. Insurance seven, take three. Marker. That was fantastic, you guys. Mia, can you dust the snow off the leads' clothing? On it. I want to re-set one more time so we can get a snap-zoom of the guy's reaction. On it. We're doing another shot? It'll look amazing. I see where you're going for, but I don't think we need it. Come on, Dave, throw us a bone here. Gives something fun to do besides pointing the camera straight ahead. Bruce, we don't need it. We're on-time, we're under-budget, and we have all the shots that the creative director... that is me... needs. Okay, Dave, I feel like your concept is great, but I feel like the ad agency put us together this week for a reason. I'm just here to bring a little more... oomph. Needs a bit of oomph. Oomph! It has oomph. A smidge more oomph never hurt anyone. Okay. Fine. But, for the record, I don't think it's necessary. Let's make magic! You won't regret it. Okay, fine, you were right. This once, but don't let it go to your head. Okay, that's a wrap, everybody! Thank you very much! There is a fro-yo truck out front, as a thank-you for a great week. Yeah! I like coffee with the fro-yo. - Copy that. - All right. Looks like the agency teamed us up together again. A bakery spot in the New Year. At least we have the New Year's off. Any big plans? Well, actually, I'm going to a huge New Year's eve party with my boyfriend, Alex, and then it's my 30th birthday the next weekend. Really? Why? Because it's my 30? No, I meant that, isn't everybody exhausted and partied out after the holidays? Must be hard to get people to come. It can be... Which is why I throw the best parties. It sets the tone for my entire year. They have to be spectacular, otherwise no one will come. Define "spectacular". Here. 21. Penthouse in Vegas. 25. Tropical beach party when it was 10-below-zero outside. And 28... We rented out an entire B&B for the weekend. Hard to beat. What are you gonna do for your big 3-0? I'm sure it'll be great. Yeah, well, you know what? I don't even want to think about my birthday yet. New year's is a big enough deal. Why? You ask a lot of questions for a guy I barely even know. Okay, never mind. It's just... It's an important night for me. Me too. I get together with my buddies out in Farmingham every year, and we have a midnight football game. Basically, whoever doesn't sprain their ankle wins. Well, I will be wearing four-inch heels, so I guess same goes for me. Well, happy New Year. Same to you. Fingers crossed. I can go home and get you another dress, if you don't like this one. No, Mia, this is perfect, and this falls under "best friend cone of silence". You can never let Alex know that, if it wasn't for your constant guidance, I would be wearing hoodies and sweatpants all the time. Well, we all have our thing. You direct people, I dress them. So tonight's the night? Don't jinx it! I'm not. Alex is well aware of your whole engaged-by-30 plan. We all are. Well, I'm not technically 30 until next week. It's New Year's eve. It's showy and dramatic, just like Alex. Anyway... I'm sure it'll happen at midnight. No way! I know, right? How awesome is this? Amazing! I was going for serious, yet compassionate... All under an aura of trustworthiness. Perfect. Here, take a pic for my instachat. All right... Got it! - You get it? - Yep. Wait... Before we go in. Yes? You've got just, like, a little smudge of lipstick on your tooth. There you go. You look gorgeous, by the way. Okay? In we go. Alex! Gwen! Happy New Year! I'm glad... You could make it. I was worried you'd go to the Burtons' party. Now, why would we do that? They hired a '90's cover band. We have to go... By the way, Alex, congratulations on your coverage of the blizzard last month. I'm sure you'll win some awards for that. Well, you know what? It's not about the awards. I just like helping people. That's... That's my new ad! They needed this in time for New Year's eve. I'm so glad you're going to see this. Funny... talented and gorgeous? How did I ever get so lucky? I'm the lucky one. You know what... Just excuse me for a minute. Hey! Hey. Let's go on the balcony. The balcony? Yeah. Okay. Here. Thank you. You know, that's funny. This almost looks like the balcony from your ad. Does it? Everybody, it's time! Here we go. ...five, four, three, two... One! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, sweetie. Right! You... You probably want... This. Cheers. Wait, where's the...? You didn't... You didn't drink it, did you? Yeah, I know... I expected a better vintage, too. Maybe we should've gone to the Burtons' after all. You ready to go back in? I think he's gone. Who? This old friend from college. He's always trying to get me to invest in his semi-legal pyramid scheme. I just... I had to escape, you know? Right. Of course. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? Hey. This is going to be a big year for both of us, Gwen. We're both going to hit the big time. Together. Just like we always planned. - I love you. - Love you, too. Come on. I can't believe he didn't do it. Did he say anything? Just that this was gonna be a big year for us. So that's it. He's just waiting for your birthday party next week so all your friends can be there. - You think? - I'm positive. - That's what you said last night. - Did I? It's hard to remember. It was technically last year. My birthday. Yeah! Thank you! What did you wish for? That we could be done with this so I can get home and get ready for my party! Don't worry, I'll help you get ready. Let's go, let's go! Happy birthday, Gwen. Thank you, Bruce. Great spread, by the way. Well, you know how I like to immerse myself in the product. Lucky for us, we had a chain of bakeries this week. Not yet, new guy. Wait. Are any of these vegan or gluten-free? No... You're the best. You are the best. Thank you. Happy birthday. Impressive flowers. Liberal use of carnations. Is there something wrong with carnations? No! Not if you're a horse just won the Preakness. And what kind of flowers do you get your girlfriend? I try to avoid those. - Flowers? - Girlfriends. Well, in that case, I might have some friends that... I'm gonna stop you right there. I've had a bit of a bad run. I'm kind of on a self-imposed dating hiatus. Bad breakup? Bought her carnations. Never heard from her again. Excuse me. A bit of a problem. The actress doesn't actually want to eat the cookie. What? Why? Does she... does she have food allergies? No. She's zero-carb. She has to eat the cookie! It's the crux of the commercial! In the commercial, the couple is fighting. He goes to the bakery and brings her something. She takes a bite, and, suddenly, he turns into... A superhero! She has to eat the cookie! I will fix this. Just watch the master at work. All set. What'd you do? I just gave her one of the high-protein cookies. We have those? How's it going? You're evil. But I checked to see if she had food allergies. And I prefer "resourceful". Lock... it... up. Let's shoot something! Resourceful. Good. Yeah, no, that's good. Thank you. It's from Alex. No numbers. Timeless. And... action! Practical. Not practical. Cut! My bad. And... cut! 'Kay. We got it. That's a wrap! Can you help me bring these out? Happy birthday. Have fun at your party. Thanks! You can come if you want. Thanks, but it's karaoke night with the copywriters. If I don't get there early, they will steal my Journey song. "Don't stop believing"? No, that's for hacks. I go way deep. "Patiently". Probably haven't heart of it. "Infinity" album, 1978. I did not have you pegged for a classic rock person. I used to be. Alex and I don't really go any place that has karaoke. Only "opera-oke"? See you. Bye! "Opera-oke". It's funny. That's the event planner. Everything is good to go. I will meet you guys after dinner with Alex. Where's he taking you? Avenue 16. Everyone gets engaged there. That's where Nolan proposed to me. Is it? Alex, this is wonderful. Thank you. And thank you for everything you sent today. You really do have perfect taste. Well, you deserve whatever you want on your birthday, baby. Here are the drinks. Thank you. Cheers! It's good, right? You know, y... What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. Well, that's nice. Is it new? It's the watch you gave me today. Right. Of course it is. You didn't pick it out, did you? I might've had just, like, a little bit of help. What about the flowers? - The bag? - Well... Did you not pick out anything? Who did? My intern. What? Look, I just wanted to make sure you'd like them! You know I'm terrible at that kind of stuff. It just... But... I did pick out one more thing on my own. A very... Special... Birthday present. It's a smart phone for your finger! Here! Check this out. What... Finger do I put it on? Whichever one you want. Beautiful. Alex? Just one second. Hey, I'm not really feeling so well. I think I'm just going to go home. But it's your birthday party. Alex... Okay, yeah, I'm sorry, babe. If you're sick, you're sick. I'll take you home. No. No, you should stay. Make sure everybody has a good time. Mia can drive me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Just, text me later. You bet! I just want to know. You know? I do. You've had that "life to-do" list since you were 13. My entire world collapsed the year my dad died, and I never wanted to feel out-of-control. That's why I made all these lists. And everything has gone exactly how I planned it, up until now. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Alex? You're home. Dave? What are you doing here? I was at dinner around the corner, with some friends, and, well, they had this huge protein-power-cookie on the dessert menu. I thought it was funny. I got it for you. I thought you'd still be at your party, so I was just gonna drop it off with the, storyboard. Really funny. Thank you. That's very nice. Why aren't you at your party? Are you okay? Yeah. Great. Best birthday ever. The bakery people from the commercial told me they made you a huge cake. I bet that was great. I tried to bribe them to put a trick candle on it, they wouldn't go for it. I kind of left before that part. Why? I'd rather not say. Sorry. None of my business. Do you have a match? Why? Trust me. No one should have a birthday without blowing out... A candle. Make a wish. I've been told that it sets a tone for the entire year. - I said that, didn't I? - Yup. And as somebody who'll be working with you on a daily basis, take one for the team. Okay. - What'd you wish for? - I'm not telling you. Come on. You know that jinxing-it thing is a myth. You know what? Fine, I will tell you, because it's impossible to have come true. I wished that I could see exactly what my life looked like in 10 years. Isn't not knowing what makes life fun? Not for me. I like knowing what to expect at all times. Well... - Thanks again for the cookie. - Yeah, you're welcome. - Good night. - 'Night. What... what is up with my eyes? I can't go to work like this! E... O... F... G... Z... T? Actually, it's E-D-F-C-Z-P. What is going on? I have had perfect vision. You're not Dr. Corben. I'm subbing in for him when he's away on a cruise. Getting away from the cold, you know? So, have you started any new medications? Had any recent... head trauma? No. This literally just came out of nowhere. I'm going to put some drops in your eyes. It'll make everything a little bit blurrier for a bit, but in a moment, you'll see everything a lot more clearly. Chin here, please. Daddy tried to kill you with macadamia nuts? No, silly! I said he didn't know I was allergic. I know. - I love you. - I love you, too. Are you okay? What was in those eye drops? Just something to help you see more clearly. There's something seriously wrong with those. And how is your vision now? It's okay... I guess. Now. You're welcome. Relax, Gwen. It was not real. It was a hallucination from the light or lack of sleep. Hey. Morning! I... Dave? But it gets weirder. I'm not sure that's possible. I had a macadamia nut allergy. What? You love macadamia nuts. I know! And... get this! I had three kids. Three! I barely even want one. And... I lived in the suburbs! Alex and I always said that we would stay in the city or move to the beach. Except you weren't married to Alex, you were married to Dave. Stop saying that. Gwen, it's not like he's some kind of hideous monster. He's a good-looking guy, and he's nice to everyone, he's funny... Why are you talking about this like this is a real thing? It was obviously some light, or eye-drop-induced hallucination. Of course it is. Okay, let's do this! All right. Rolling! Barbecue one. Take one. Marker. Hold the roll! I just... I want to do something different with the blocking. It needs more of a build. Here we go. Just give me one minute. One minute. I'm timing you. Okay, let's go! Do you want to tell me what's going on? Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I meant with the blocking. That'll be fine, too. Okay, let's go! Rolling! Barbecue one, take one. Marker! And... action. And... cut! So? I love it. All right! Great! Let's set up for the next shot. What if we added one more kid? Really sell it. Three... kids? Yeah. I had five brothers and sisters growing up. Three is perfect. No! No, no. Three is all wrong. One is perfect. Two, maybe. But three, no way. Okay, yeah, there isn't time anyway. This is fine. Yeah, everything's fine exactly the way it is. Yeah. Well, we should talk about next week's shoot. Right. What is that again? I'll show you. Grab your coat. That's... A minivan. Yeah. I told them how much you like to immerse yourself into the product. It's all yours for as long as you want it. Easy there. Are you all right? I just need to sit down. Maybe you should see a doctor. No, no, no. I'm just... I'm probably just hungry. Here. Macadamia nuts. Daddy tried to kill you... ...with macadamia nuts? I knew it wasn't real. I don't think they make imitation macadamia nuts. You know what? I'm fine. I feel much better now. I feel much better now. No. No, no, no! No! No! Gwen, are you allergic to macadamia nuts? No... Yep! You're allergic to macadamia nuts. But I never was before! It's perfectly normal to develop an intolerance later in life. I'll be right back with your prescription. And try to stop scratching. Do you know what this means? Do not say it. I have to! What if your vision is really coming true and marrying Dave is your fate? I don't believe in fate. I control my own destiny, Mia. I still believe that. Okay. So what's your next move? Lie in a tub full of oatmeal. Good call. - Hey! - Hey. Where have you been? I texted you hours ago. Why aren't you dressed? We have that animal rescue benefit, remember? No, I can't go. Apparently, I have developed an allergy to macadamia nuts. What? Seriously? Yeah, my entire body is one big itch. You look miserable. Don't they have, like, any medicine you can take? This is 90% better than what it was. Yikes. Well... I can stay with you, if you want. I mean, the station did want me there to represent them, but... It's okay, I'll tell them you're sick. No! No. You should go. It's great publicity. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Thanks, babe. You're the best. Okay. I'll call you later. See ya. I am so glad you changed your mind! - Hi. - Hi... I know coming over here again seems vaguely, well, creepy, but I wanted to see how you were doing. I felt responsible for, you know, causing this to happen. I am much better. Thank you. Good. I, brought you some chicken noodle soup. I realize soup isn't necessarily helpful with an allergic reaction, but, well, I didn't know if we were good enough friends for me to drop by with a tube of hydrocortisone. You don't think we're friends? I'm not sure. You just brought me hot soup on a cold winter night. You are in. Yes! Well, I should get going. I'm sure Alex is already taking great care of you. No. He had a thing. We had a thing he went to. I told him to go. But you wanted him to stay. Right. And just because we're officially friends now doesn't mean you can ask me that. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. My bad. Well, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call. Okay. The soup? Right. The soup. Here you go. Thanks. Good night. 'Night. Does your skin feel better? So much better. What was in that cream, mom? A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Nurse's trade secrets. Mom, you just worked a double shift, you're tired. We could've just bought a cake. Are you kidding me? We always bake a cake together on your birthday! I'm just sorry I couldn't make the party. You didn't miss a thing. Well, so, obviously, he didn't ask me. So you move on. I can't just move on, mom. We've been together for three years. We've made plans. Plans change. Not mine. I don't want change. I don't want surprises. I need to know what to expect. Gwen, I understand. After your dad died, all you wanted was to feel in control of your future. But all I wanted was for you to know you that you can take care of yourself, even if the unexpected happens. And you're doing that! You're smart, you're kind, you're doing what you love... Just let the rest unfold in its own time. You need to sit him down and talk to him, Gwen. You deserve to know where things stand. No, you're right. We're having dinner tomorrow. I will talk to him then. But... Tomorrow is tomorrow. And, today... You only have one job, and that is to destroy this beautiful cake. Hi. Just so you know, this isn't... this isn't my real car. Research for work. I'm so not the minivan type! Okay. Hi. Alex Stone for two. Thank you. Alex... And... I'm done. I wanted to... Wait. Sorry. And... now... I am... done. Go. Alex, I wanted... Mr. Stone, we finally received our case of '89 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape. Fantastic! We'll take a bottle. We'll take two... Alex. I'm sorry. I should've asked if you wanted something else. Maybe a Merlot, or...? No, what I... what I want is to talk about our future. Just one second, please. Gwen... Sweetie... I definitely want to talk about that, okay? But maybe it's better if we did it privately. We're at a table for two. Just you and me. Well, yes, in the middle of the most popular restaurant in the city. I'll tell you what. We'll go to that gallery opening over the weekend, and we'll go someplace quiet for brunch after, and then we can talk. But tonight, right now, let's just try to have a nice time. Right? Why wouldn't talking about our future be "nice"? We've been together for three years. - Wouldn't you want... - Gwen. I know what you're going to say, okay? And you don't have to worry. It'll happen. I'm just... I'm just waiting for the absolute perfect moment. I just want to do it right. We are going to have it all, Gwen. We will be the couple that everyone else wants to be. Just be patient. Okay? Yeah. Yeah? Okay. What's this? They already have photos of us up from tonight on that city gossip site. So silly. Did you... Did you drive here in a minivan? How's yours? This is really good. Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Maya! Happy birthday, dear Maya happy birthday to you Will you marry me? Yes! I love you! Check, please. Good morning! Feeling better? Yeah. Thanks again for the soup. Any time. Okay! Is everybody ready? No! I said no! What? Sorry, Gwen. The little boy's having a bit of a tantrum. What? What's he upset about? He thinks his Teddy bear is "looking at him weird". Seriously? Yeah. Yeah, look. Well, hello, Joey. I'm a bear, and I have a secret to tell you. Will you hold him for me? Let's roll! Okay. Minivan six, take three. Marker! All right, action, Joey! Cut! All right, that's great! Let's move on to the other angle. All right, good job, buddy! Thanks, boss! My neck is killing me. I cannot wait for next week. The spa ad. First item up for research... deep-tissue massage. Have you checked your email in the last hour? No. Why? How do you feel about dogs? I am uncomfortable around them. All of them? I had a bad experience with them when I was a kid. Why? We have a dog food ad? Yep. Agency loves what we're doing. They want to keep us teamed up indefinitely. The clients are actually asking for us specifically. They love us. It's a good thing, Gwen. No. No. No, it's not. I have to text my agent. You know, I think we could get really creative on this one. Shoot the whole thing from a dog's perspective. Okay, cut! Joey, don't look into the camera, okay, buddy? - Sorry! - It's okay! We should break for lunch. You want to direct? Yeah, eventually. You want some? No, thank you. Don't know what you're missing. I will use my imagination. Speaking of which, we should meet up at the dog park on Saturday, brainstorm some ideas. Can't. Don't worry. I'll protect you. No, it's not that. I have plans. With Alex. Hey! Trust me. And, for the record, I know you're with... "Johnny Volcano, weatherman". I'm not trying to... I know. Okay. Good. "Johnny Volcano". You got... Can I... Great. Thank you. You're welcome. It's a metaphor for climate change. Don't you see it? It's stunning. Right. So, like, the SPF is how many years until the end of the world as we know it? Yes! You're brilliant, babe! You totally get it. I totally just made that up. Hey, you know what? Let's go say hi to our friends from the film society, shall we? Friends? We don't... we don't even know their names. Well, we will in two minutes. What do we have here? Ahi tuna? Yes, please. Thank you. Now that is so good. - You want so? - No. No. Keep them coming, sir. Thank you, sir. I'm starving, and I won't have time to eat before work, so... I thought we were going to lunch after this. To talk. Gwen... I'm so sorry, I thought I told you. I'm subbing in as anchor this afternoon! That's... No. You didn't. That's really great news. I know, right? Can you DVR it for me, so we can add it to my reel? Sure. You know what? I should actually get going to the studio, so... love you. Wish me luck. Good luck. And how can I help you today? I just really want to check my vision again in the... in the machine. Okey-dokey. Everything looks good. Let's try this. Cover your right eye and read the chart from left to right. Doctor, I'm sorry, is there any way that there might be a carbon-monoxide leak in the office or something? Of course not. Why do you ask? No reason. I'm gonna go. Okay. Ready? Ready? Good! Good boy! ...macadamia nuts. Go play! Hey! Is that... Your dog? Yeah, that's, that's Max. Didn't expect to see you here. I didn't... I didn't come on purpose. I was just walking by. Coincidence. Personally, I don't believe in coincidences. I think everything happens for a reason. Well, I believe that we have control over things that happen. You make a plan, and then you do it. Okay. Well, I figured you might want to see the dogs, figure out the best way to shoot them. In there? No. Okay, what gives? Why are you so nervous around dogs? When I was a kid, I got bitten. It's a good reason, right? I'm sorry. Was it bad? Bad enough for me to be nervous about them now. I know dogs are great, everybody loves dogs, but... It's my thing. It's a weird thing, everybody has one. No, not me. I'm perfect. Come on. Okay. I... I have a fear of getting sick from eating street food. When I was ten, I had a taco. It was a very bad night. Okay, but what are the chances that that is gonna happen again? I could say the same thing to you. Maybe it's time to take a risk. Make some changes. I'm not big on change. Try it. Who knows? You might even be happier. Come on! Yeah, I'm not ready. Okay. Sure thing. Bye! Nice. Seat-warmers on. Answer phone. Hello? Gwen, it's Mia. Do you still have that minivan? I do, but before you make fun of me, this isn't about the "vision" thing". It's about the heated seats. And the on-board Wi-Fi. And the new-car smell. Noted. Why? Why do you ask? Because I kind of need a huge favor. I was supposed to drop off my nieces and nephew at school this morning, because my sister's sick, but my car just broke down. You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency. No, I'll be right there. Thank you. Gwen, these are my nieces Maddy and Lilly, and my nephew, Ellis. Can you say "hi," guys? Hi, guys. Very funny. This is my very best friend, Gwen. She's helping us this morning. Be nice. It's only a ten-minute drive. Do you hate me for doing this to you? No, really, it's fine. Their school's on the way. Thank you, Gwen. Answer phone. Hello? Hey, Gwen, it's Dave. Listen, my engine froze over last night. I can't get it started. Is there any way you can give me a ride? I would, but I'm all the way over on Pine right now. Pine? Perfect! I live right around the corner. Yeah. Perfect. Here we go! Okay. Here we go. Hey. Everyone, this is Dave. Can you say "hi," guys? Hi, guys! Never gets old. Classic. Hey. Do you mind if I drive? I've been dying to test her out. Really? Yeah. Okay. But you have to be careful. Of course. Thank you. Why? Come on! I think I'll direct this one from the car. Gwen, they're all rescue dogs from the North Shore Animal League. They're extremely well-trained and as gentle as they come. Yeah, I'm gonna check on wardrobe. Gwen, there is no wardrobe. They're dogs. Then I'm gonna check on the lighting. Gwen... Okay, here we are. What is this? Well, did you know the trainer doesn't just do film and television? He also works with therapy dogs, and when they're puppies, they need to start to learn to be gentle around people. So where are you going with this? Well, it turns out that some of the puppies are here today. No. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's just one little puppy. I'll be with you the whole time. I think it's way better if you just faced your fear. Come on. After you. All right. Kneel down. Here we are. Hi! Hi! Hello! Is he going to bite me? No, no, no, no. He's just... he's just teething, you can't even feel it. That's not so bad! No! I thought that would be so much worse! Hi! Hi. Hey, you're just a little guy. You don't bite hard. You're just teething. That's not so bad! Yeah! Okay. Hello. Come here. That's a lot of puppies! Come on. Lots of puppies! Lots of puppies. - Hello! - Hi. Hello! Hello! Hi! Thank you. I really needed this. And cut! We good with that shot? Yeah. You? Yeah. - Good. - Good. - Good. - Good! You're not gonna argue about it? That's a new one. What's going on with you two? Nothing. Well, that nothing is really something. Gwen, what are you doing? Are you okay? You sounded upset. Did something happen with Alex? No. I think I might... Have feelings for Dave. My gosh! That's great! No, it's not! I have a boyfriend. I thought you were rooting for us! It doesn't matter what I think. But I see you and Dave together, and I don't know! Does that vision you saw really seem so far-fetched now? Mia, I can't throw away the future that I planned because of vision I saw at the eye doctor. I mean, it's probably all just a coincidence, and this isn't fair to Alex. He has done nothing wrong. But that doesn't mean the two of you are right. Well, maybe I can't give my all to Alex because I'm spending too much time with Dave. Well, you guys work together. There's nothing you can do about that. What did you do? Nothing! I may have recommended Dave for a directing gig next week, but it's no big deal. You got him a new job just to get him away from you? No. No! I want to help him. He told me that he wanted to start directing, so I just made a couple of calls. And it's just for the week. Now this will give me more time to breathe and look at things objectively. I never thought I'd see Gwen Turner so scared. Of what? The truth? Change? Your heart? Director's choice. Cut! Cut. I said that already. That's not your job. What's the problem? The lights are too bright. It's an infomercial. The light has to be bright it will be airing in the middle of the night and we want people to stay awake. The model has been complaining about the heat on set. Okay, are you trying to film a commercial or get a date to the prom? Maybe we should've hired a male director, 'cause he would get that we're not selling the shake, we're selling the body that you get from the shake. Okay, I'm sorry, did you just time-travel from an ad agency from 1961? What're you doing? I'm texting the agency to let them know that if they ever put me on another one of your accounts, I will never work for them again. He's no Dave. I know, I know. This is incredible, babe. What's the occasion? Nothing. I just figured since we haven't spent a lot of time with each other in a while, why not go all out? Hey! Why don't we go to Vermont for the weekend? I have an audition. For w... for what? An anchor job, of course. And then if you get this job, then what? It's "L.A., here we come". Alex, you know that I won't move to L.A. with you unless we're more... ...fully committed. Okay, well, you know what? I don't have the job yet, so why worry about something that hasn't even happened? I didn't even know that you were worried about it at all. Babe! L.A. is our vision. Together! Right? Don't worry, I'm not going to leave you behind. I promise. You know what? This is just a really, really great photo of me. Hey! What's up? Hey! Do you and Nolan want to go get brunch? I wish we could, but we're going to the hockey game right after this fitting. Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow? Yes! Yay. It's a date. So, how's Alex doing in L.A.? He's been really busy. I really haven't talked to him at all. I'll let you go. Call me tomorrow? You got it. When did I get so needy? That's perfect! Gwen! Dave? Thought that was you! What are you doing here? Well, what else would an aspiring director be doing on Saturday than seeing his girl Friday? Well, you're not "aspiring" anymore. How was this week? They, they actually want to hire me again. I'm not surprised. That's great, Dave. You're happy for me? Of course! Why wouldn't I be? I want to ask you something, because, if I don't, it's just, it's gonna eat at me. Did you get me that directing job so that you could get rid of me? How did you know that I helped you get it? Someone at the agency mentioned it, but you didn't answer the question. I just thought that it would be a great opportunity for you. So you did it for my future? The thing is, I always... Saw my future with you. Professionally speaking. Did you think that I meant... No! No. Of course not. Are you sure? Why? Is... Is that what you meant? Would it be okay if it was? I can't answer that. Then it isn't what I meant. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Hey! Why didn't you text me back last night? Or at all during the day? I was worried. Listen, I can't talk too long, but I wanted to ask, can you do a quick edit of my reel today? I need you to find that story I did on the brush fire and add it the "weather 9-1-1" part, you know, with like action music and stuff. Would you mind? Well, I'm supposed to go shopping with Mia. Why can't you do it? You know how. Please, Gwennie? I have meetings all day and... Well, you know, you're the pro. This is our future, remember? This could be the start of big, big things. Yeah. Okay. I love you so much. Thank you. Bye. And that, folks, is gonna be our weekend weather. Back to you, Bob! WKNW. Back to you, Bob! It's not too bad, folks! Come on down! It's gonna be okay. Stay home all day! You know what I'm talking about. You don't need to be out here. You and the kids bundle up, stay out of the wind. Alex stone's got you covered from WKNW. Hi! Ready to go? I am so sorry. I lost track of time. I'm helping Alex finish his reel. He might get this anchor gig out in L.A. Just tell Alex I took you by force. Come on! We need some girl-time! Twist my arm. Okay! Fine! Fine. Do I have anything on my teeth? - No. - No? Are you sure? You know what? Let's grab lunch before we hit the shops. Here? Yeah, I read a review. Great burgers. Okay. ...so, in his contract, he had it so he had a girdle! And they would... they would tighten up his stomach! - Hey! - Hey! What're you all doing here? We come here all the time. We would've invited you, but you're usually off doing something fancy with Johnny Volcano. Mr. Volcano! "Hey, I'm Johnny Volcano!" We just didn't figure it was your style. "Johnny Volcano". I see the nickname has stuck. Yeah. Well, I will say one thing. Alex wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this. We'll stay. Yeah! It's about time! Grab a seat, ladies! Absolutely. Okay! Okay! Okay. You should buy us the next round. I am going to buy a round for the table. The power? I thought there'd be a bigger reaction. Trivia! Now we're talking! You feeling confident, Blondie? I am feeling like a winner. When did fried pickles become a thing? Like, life altered. Amazing. Who was the American revolution's "Fighting Frenchman?" Lafayette. Yes. Okay, whoever "hot wings McGee" is, I will crush you in the final round. Come on, McGee, where are you? Show yourself! Hot Dave! Hot Dave McGee! "Hot wings Dave"! Davey-boy! Bring it over! Come over here! Did you know he was gonna be here? I swear, I didn't. I mean, I thought maybe, but I wasn't sure. That isn't helping anything, Mia. Just have fun. It's not a date or anything. I never thought that I'd see you at a place like this. If it's awkward, I can go. No! No. Why would it be? I don't know. It's not. Never mind. Good! You are staying... So I... ...can defeat you. Not likely. I have a photographic memory. I'm a human jeopardy board. You are going down, miss Turner. The next round's about to start. Would you like to pick the topic? Yeah. Football! No... I don't know anything about football. Is that the one with the home runs? You're going down! That's you. Victory is mine. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. What? Nothing. You just seem really relaxed. Can I get you another drink? Sure. I like this Gwen. Me too. When you get really good, free steak dinners. That's pro level, though. That's like top of the heap. Warm pretzels. You want to share one? I'm good. Right. Street-food-aphobia. That's actually not the technical term. One more for the gentleman, please. No, I'm good. Thanks. Two words... puppy... party. It is now your turn to face your fears. Also, it's bread. No one gets food poisoning from bread. Okay, fine. So good. Let me know how that goes. That's it? That's your idea of moral support? You're not gonna get sick. I'm 100% certain. Right? Call it 90%. Still good odds. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. I should get going. Have a lot of prep work to do for Monday, and have to finish... Other things. Right, the ski resort commercial. Should be fun. Let me know how it goes. You're not coming up? They actually tapped me for another gig. This weekend. Ranch dressing. That's great, Dave. I'm really happy for you. And you know, since I'm so in demand as a director now, I'm not sure when we'll be back working together, so... Any chance we can play trivia together again? We make a great team. We'd be unstoppable. It's... Complicated. No, it's not. You just pick the right answer. I don't mean trivia. Neither do I. Happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday to me... I wish I knew what to do. "I love the reel. Looking good". "Thx". You don't even have time to write the word "thanks"? What am I doing? Hey, Bruce. Hey, guys. Hey. Kian. How are you? I am excellence, 24/7. Neat. Ready to start deciding on some locations? Yes, we're just waiting on the 2nd unit director. The 2nd unit director? Since when? Since it's cheaper to shoot the whole thing in one day with two crews than put everyone up for an extra night. The other guy will do the exterior stuff. Okay. So who's "the other guy"? Thank you for joining us. And we're walking. What happened to your ranch dressing? Well, the agency called me this morning and asked me to fill in here instead. I really wish someone told me that you were coming up. Gwen, I realize that I make you feel conflicted about your relationship with the local weatherman, but... This is just work. I never said that. You didn't need to. This looks good. Watch out, the ice is slippery. Lucky for you, I am sturdy like a mountain goat. Here, let me help you. You okay? Yeah. Are you okay? Are you two okay? Mind if I borrow some fire? What're you making? Chicken casserole. What do you think? S'mores! Wait. You have made s'mores before, right? I have had s'mores-flavored coffee beverages. You've been camping though, right? Does a cabin with indoor plumbing and internet access count? No. Then, I don't quite see the appeal. Quiet reflection. Bonding with nature. S'mores! Mosquitos, bears, alien abductions. My dad was going to take me, but that never happened, so I guess I just crossed it off my list. You know, not everything you do has to be on your list. But I like it like that. Then I know what to expect. Isn't what makes life interesting the unexpected? What about your family? Normal, stable, happy family. Not that my childhood was perfect. Our house actually burned down when I was a kid. I'm sorry. No, don't be. Taught me that the things that we surround ourselves with are just that... things. What's really important is spending time with friends and family, enjoying the simple pleasures in life. Like sitting around a fire, roasting marshmallows with a good friend? Yeah. Just like that. Here. - Here. - Thank you. Okay. Ready? Yeah... There you go. Okay. What're you waiting for? Nothing. I just don't want to get it all over my face. Who cares? Get messy. Have fun. I could get used to this. Me too. Hey there! Mind if we join you? No! Not at all. Can I interest you... In a s'more? Thank you! Aw, we haven't done this since Becky was little. How old is she now? 42. Do you two have kids? - We're not... - We're just friends. - We work together. - Yeah. What do you do? We're both commercial directors. We're shooting an ad for the resort. Seems more like vacation. Yeah. It's not a bad way to spend my birthday. Wait. Your birthday? Happy birthday. Why didn't you say anything? I don't like to make a big deal out of my birthday. Not like some people I know. Wait. You... Make a wish. I think you know what my wish is, don't you? Yeah. It's Alex. He's coming up here. Right now. I see. This isn't... right, since I'm with him... And even if I wanted to... and I... I have to talk to him. He deserves that much. Hello! Hey, mom! Can you talk? I can't see you. You have to push the camera button. Thanks, sweetie. Who's that? Well... There's no time like the present. Gwen... This is Charles. Hey there, Gwen. I'm glad to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. And I've heard... Absolutely nothing about you. Well, I wanted to make sure I got that feeling. And I did. He's a keeper. And so are you. Mom, I didn't even know you were dating. Aren't you scared to open up your heart after what happened to dad? Of course I am. But I've never been happier. I know you want to know what your future holds now, Gwen, but sometimes you can't get to where you need to go until you take a different path. Dinner's ready! And he cooks, too! Just do what makes you happy today, sweetheart. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Thanks, mom. Can I call you later? Of course. I love you! I love you. Hey! Hey. Are you ready for my big news? I didn't get the anchor job. I'm... sorry? I got a part in an action movie! Like a real speaking role? Yep. I'm playing... Wait for it. A weatherman. But I found out something so important about myself. I love acting. That's what I want to do! So you got the lead? Nope, I have two lines, but it's a start! And then you're coming back to the East Coast? No, no, no, no, no. I want to move to Los Angeles, you know, make a real go of it. With you by my side. When would this move happen? Next week? Seriously? Why not? I mean, you can direct commercials out there, and then start making connections with the studios. It's what we always talked about, right? Not... not exactly, Alex. I mean, I don't really even know if my dream is to direct big-budget movies anymore. Maybe I want to make documentaries. You know, really make a change in the world. You don't... you don't need to be in L.A. for that. Documentaries? Gwennie... Those don't make any money. Alex, that's not the point. Then what is the point? Are you saying you don't want to move to L.A. anymore? L.A. isn't the problem, Alex. We are. Okay, you know what? Don't say another word. I know what this is about. I know what you want. Wait one second. What's that? It's not a diamond, but it'll have to do for now. Gwen, sweetie... Will you marry me? What are you doing? Alex, I didn't say yes. Why wouldn't you? I don't want to marry you. Yes, you do. That's all you ever talk about. I am so sorry if I ever pressured you. I think that I just couldn't admit to myself that it was over. We just don't want the same things anymore. So you're actually saying no? What am I supposed to do right now? You know, a wise woman just told me that everyone should follow their own path. What? I have to go. Where? To follow mine. Hey! Do you guys know where Dave went? He left. He seemed very upset. Why would you get engaged to someone else? He saw Alex propose? I said no! Didn't he see me say no? Come on, Dave. Pick up your phone. Come on. Hey! I was shopping for the shoot. I got up here as soon as I could. Are you okay? Not even a little. Resort 5, take 4. Mark! Sorry. Action! Hey! Cheese! Resort 5, take 5. Mark! We got it. That's a wrap! Tail lights in an hour. No O.T. Gwen! You forgot this. He blocked my texts and my calls. He doesn't even really know what happened. It's okay. You'll find him. Yeah. Yes! Hey! Bruce! Hey. Have you seen Dave? You just missed him. Do you know where he went? No, I wish I knew. He definitely wasn't himself. I got to go. Hey. Hi! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. I could be! Dave! Dave! Get away from me! Get down. No, no. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, guys, can you give us a moment? Yeah. Thank you. Little different from puppies. What are you doing here, Gwen? I wanted to tell you. What? What could you possibly have to say to me? You got engaged to the wrong guy. I know it, you know it. I can't believe you said yes. But Dave, that's what I've been trying to tell you! I said no. But I saw him put a ring on your finger. And then what happened? I don't know. I couldn't stick around to watch it. I told him that it was over. I kinda wish I'd stuck around to watch that. What made you change your mind? When I finally realized that planning my whole life out didn't make me any happier. You know, when I was with Alex, I always felt like we were putting on a show. You know, "the perfect couple". But... When I'm with you, I'm just me. I'm happy. When I saw Alex propose to you... I thought every vision I had for my future was over. If you're saying we have a chance... What I'm saying... Is that I'm falling in love with you. When I'm with you, I feel safe, and I know this is where I belong. It's just, I don't know why it took so long to realize it. Yeah. It felt like an eternity, because I fell for you the first time I saw you on set. You're brilliant. You're beautiful. I've been waiting my whole life for you. Yes. Yeah. Baby. Hi. Yeah! Hello. Hello. Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear Gwen happy birthday to you Will you marry me? Yes! Yes, yes? I love you. So, basically, what you're saying is daddy tried to kill you with macadamia nuts? No, silly, I said he didn't know I was allergic. Or did he? I know. I love you. I love you, too.
