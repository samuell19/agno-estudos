"In the night of May 23, 1947, Willy Loman— - "traveling salesman, was found dead— - "in a car wreckage on Highway 1 outside of New York, NY. "As a result, a life insurance worth 20,326 dollars— - "was paid out to his family. "This is an account of his last 24 hours..." - Willy? - Yes, it's me. I came back. - Did something happen? - No, nothing happened. You didn't smash the car, did you? I said nothing happened. Didn't you hear me? But... what is it? Don't you feel well? - Huh? - Linda, I couldn't make it. - I just couldn't. - What? I couldn't drive. The car kept going off on its own. Maybe it was the steering again. I don't think Angelo knows the Studebaker. - No, it's me. - You'll have to take a rest. You can't continue this way. I just got back from Florida. But you didn't rest your mind. Your mind is overactive. I'll start out in the morning. Maybe I'll feel better then. These goddam arch supports are killing me. Take an aspirin. Should I get you an aspirin? I was driving along, and I was fine. I was even enjoying the scenery. It's so beautiful up there. The trees are so thick. And the sun was warm. I was really enjoying myself. I opened the window and just drove along. And all of a sudden, I'm driving off the road. I forgot I was driving. If I'd gone the other way, I might have killed somebody. So I continued along. And five minutes later... ...I nearly... I have such thoughts, such strange thoughts. Why don't you talk to Howard again? Huh? There's no reason why you can't work in New York. They don't need me in New York. I'm their New England man. - I'm vital up there. - But you're over 60 now. They can't expect you to keep travelling every week. Huh? You're too accommodating, dear. If old man Wagner was alive, I'd be in charge of New York now. When I went North the first time, they didn't know where New England was. - Why don't you tell this to Howard? - I definitely will. - Is there any cheese? - I'll make you a sandwich. No, no, go to sleep. I'll take a glass of milk. Did Biff say anything after I left? You shouldn't have criticized him, especially after he just got home. I simply asked him if he was making any money. Is that criticism? But dear, how could he make any money? Huh? I don't understand what his problem is. He's somehow lost all ambition. - Did he feel bad after I left? - Yes, he was sad. You know how he admires you. I think if he finds his way in life— - you'll both be happier and not fight so much. How can he find himself on a farm? Is that a life? A farmhand? - He has yet to make 35 dollars a week. - He is finding himself. Not finding yourself at the age of 34 is a disgrace! - Willy... - He's lazy, goddamit! - Biff is nothing but a lazy bum. - Willy... They're sleeping. Why don't you go down and make yourself a sandwich? Why did he come home? I don't know. I think he still feels lost. He's lost. Biff Loman is lost. In the greatest country in the world? How can a young man with his personality and charm be lost? And with his ability to work? No, that much is true... ...he's not lazy. You work hard your whole life to finish paying for your house. And when it's finally your own, they don't want to live here. - That's life. - Well... Some people achieve things in life. Do you remember at school... ...how they followed him around, everywhere he went? They wouldn't leave him alone. Willy. Willy? I got a new kind of American-type cheese today. It's whipped. Why do you get American cheese when I like Swiss? - For a change. - I don't want change! Why don't I ever get what I want? - I thought it would be a surprise. - Why don't you open a window? - I'm suffocating in here! - They're all open, dear. Goddamit! The street is lined with cars. Not a breath of fresh air. There should be a law against apartment houses. Remember the two lime trees, where Biff and I hung the garden swing? Like being a million miles from the city. They should have arrested the builder for cutting those down. More and more I think of those days. This time of year, it was lilac and wisteria. Then the peonies. The fragrance in this house! Yes. But people have to have a place to live. No, there's too many people now, that's the problem. - I don't think... - Listen to me! Too many people! The population is getting out of control. The competition is maddening. For Christ's sake. Smell the stink from the apartment house? And another one on the other side. How could they make cheese in this country? Why don't you just try it? What's going on? I won't fight with him any more. If he wants to go back to Texas, let him go. He'll find his way eventually. Sure. Some people just don't get started until later in life. Like Thomas Edison, or Goodrich. I think one of them was deaf. I'll put my money on Biff. And Willy... if the it's a warm Sunday, we'll drive in the country. We'll open the windows, and take lunch. No, the windows don't open on the new cars. - But you opened it today. - Me? I didn't. - Now that's peculiar. - What, darling? - Very strange. - What is? Do you remember the Chevy I had in 1928? Yes? I could have sworn I was driving that car today. Don't worry about that. Something must have reminded you. Remarkable... Do you remember the way Biff always worked on that car? The car dealer refused to believe there was 80,000 miles on it. Linda, dear. Go to bed now. I'll be right up. Be careful on the stairs, dear. The cheese is on the middle shelf. Damn, maybe he smashed up the car again. He's going to lose his license if he keeps this up. I'm getting worried about him. - His eyes are going. - No. I've driven with him. There's nothing wrong with his eyes. He just doesn't keep his mind on it. I drove into town with him last week. He stopped at a green light, then it turned red. That's when he drove. - Maybe he's color-blind. - Dad? No, he's got the best eye for color in the whole business. - You're not still angry with him? - Nah. He is the way he is. We're all different. We had driven 80,000 miles. 82,000, to be exact. It's funny, isn't it? Us sleeping in here again. Our old room... Everything we've talked about in here. - Our whole lives. - A lot of plans. A lot of dreams. About 500 women would like to know what's been said in this room. Remember that big what's-her-face? What the hell was her name? - Over at Bushwick Avenue. - With the collie dog? That's right. I got you in there, remember? Yeah, that was my first time. Boy, she was something else! You taught me everything I know about women. I bet you forgot how bashful you used to be, especially with girls. - I still am. - You are? I just don't show it, that's all. I think I got less bashful, while you got more so. What happened? Biff? Where's the old humor? There's no confidence left. What's wrong? Why does Dad mock me all the time? - He's not mocking you. - He is. Everything I say, he's got that look on his face. He just wants you to do well, that's all. Biff... I want to talk to you about Dad. - I've been wanting it for a long time. - I noticed it this morning. He's always mumbled to himself like that. Not this much. It got so embarrassing I sent him to Florida on vacation. You know something? Mostly he talks to you. Almost always to you. - What does he say about me? - I can't make it out. What does he say about me? The fact that you're not settled, that you're still up in the air. Might he have other things on his mind? - What do you mean? - Never mind. Just don't lay it all on me. Well, I think if you just got started with something. I mean... is there any future for you out there? To be honest, I'm not sure what the future is. What do you mean? If only I knew what I'm supposed to want. I spent six, seven years trying to work myself up. Clerk, salesman, business of one kind or another. I suffered 50 weeks of the year for the sake of a two-week vacation. When all you really desire is to be outdoors— - with your shirt off. Not having to try to get ahead of others. And still, that's how you build your... future. Do you really enjoy it on the farm? - You happy there? - My friend... There's nothing more beautiful than the sight of a mare and her colt. Boy... It's springtime, it's cool there now. Whenever spring comes, I think to myself, "What the hell am I doing? "What'll become of me?" That's when I come back home. And now I'm here, I don't know what to do with myself. I've always made a point of not wasting my life, and yet... That's exactly what I'm doing, I'm wasting my life. You're a poet, Biff. That's what you are. - You're an idealist. - No, no. I'm a goddam mess. I'm 34 years old. 34. I'm not married, I'm not in business, I'm just like a boy. Playing around with horses, 28 dollars a week, 34 years old... Like a damn kid. And you? Are you content? You're a success. Are you content? - Hell, no. - You're making money. All I can do now is wait for the merchandise manager to die. And then... if I ever become merchandise manager? He has just built a terrific estate on Long Island. He lived there for two months and sold it. And now he's building another one. He can't enjoy it once it's finished. And I know that's just what I would do. Listen, why don't you come out West with me? - You and I? - Sure! We could buy a nice ranch. We'd raise cattle and use our muscles! Men built like us should work out in the open. The Loman Brothers, eh? If you were with me, I'd be happy. Everybody at work is so false— - and I'm constantly having to lower my ideals. We'd stand up for one another. We'd have someone to trust. Yes, if I were with you. We weren't brought up to make a fortune. - I don't know how to do that. - Neither do I. - No... - Let's go West! - Let's just go. - But listen, the only thing is... - What can you make out there? - What? You mentioned your friend who built a nice ranch— - and then couldn't live there. But with him it's 52,000 dollars a year coming in through the revolving door. And I got more in my pinky finger than he's got in his head. But you said... I need to show those pompous executives that Hap Loman can make the grade. I want to walk into the store the way he walks in. Then we can be together, I swear. I promise we will. But... How about those two we had tonight? Gorgeous, huh? The most gorgeous I've had in years. Well... I get that any time I want. Whenever I'm low and need to raise my spirits a little. The trouble is, it gets like bowling or something. You just keep knocking them over, and it doesn't mean anything. It never goes anywhere. - You still run around a lot? - Nah. No, I'd like to find someone steady, someone with substance. That's what I long for too. You? You'd never come home at night. I would. Someone with character, someone with resistance. A bit like Mom. You're going to call me a bastard when I tell you this. That girl Charlotte I was with tonight is engaged to be married in a week. - No way! - I'm serious. The guy is in line for the vice-presidency of the store. I don't know what gets into me. Maybe I just have an exaggerated sense of competition or something. I took her when she was a virgin, and now I can't get rid of her. It's the third executive I've done this to. And it's like with... Well, I know you shouldn't take bribes. But the manufacturers offer me a hundred-dollar bill now and then— - to throw an order their way. You know how I don't like that sort of thing. But it's just like with this girl. It's like I'm possessed. Because it's not her I want. And still I do it and I... ...I love it. Let's go to sleep now. I guess we won't solve anything now. Do you remember Bill Oliver? Sure. He's very big now. You want to work for him again? No, but I'm thinking about something he said to me when I quit. He patted me on my shoulder, and then he said... "Biff, if you ever need a hand, just... come to me." I remember that. I think I'll go and see him. If I could borrow 10,000, or 7 or 8,000 dollars... ...then I could buy myself a beautiful ranch. Of course he'll help you out. He thinks very highly of you. If I had a ranch— - I could do the work I like and still be something. I wonder, though. I wonder if he still thinks I stole those balls. In that case he would have fired you. I think he was going to. I was never sure whether he knew or not. I think that's why I quit. But he did like me a lot. I was the only one he'd trust with the keys. Don't leave the hubcaps. Get the chamois to the hubcaps. - You hear that? - Doesn't he know Mom can hear? Are you going to wash the engine, Biff? Huh? Don't get your sweater dirty. Isn't it terrible? Don't leave again. You'll easily find a job. - You must stay. - Mom's hearing that. What a beauty treatment. Talk to him tomorrow, will you? Let's sleep now. With Mom sleeping. He's selfish and mean. Let's go to sleep. Selfish and mean... Wonderful. Yes, just like that. Pad it up, use it like a pad. That's it. Nice work. - What could it be? - A gold pen? - A new helmet for me? - Football shoes? Who knows. - You think he'll be happy now? - You know how particular he is. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Happy? It's got to be inside the car. He didn't come in with anything! In the glove compartment. No, it's empty. Look underneath the mat. Damn, there's Bernard. - Biff. - Don't push me. This is serious. When were you supposed to come to me? - About two. - One thirty. I want to say one thing before I leave. Birnbaum won't pass you unless you study. Come on! Three universities want him in their teams. Such a anemic, huh? Here, look! - A punching ball! - Wow! He must have known! This is exactly what we... How...? - Gene Tunney? - Is that Gene Tunney's signature? But that means... Pop has been this close to Gene Tunney. I can't believe it. - Where was it? - I don't know, under here. Put it back properly so he can't tell. Has your father come home? Where is he? Yeah, he's back. He went to see Charley. I see. Did he tell you how he did? Yes, he knocked Providence flat out. He swept through Boston like a storm. - Ow, Biff! - Great, Mom! There's nothing wrong with Biff. Or do you prefer a worm like Bernard? He's got personality in every inch. Every inch. I've tried to teach him right from wrong. Aren't you going to bed now, Dad? Why does she insist on waxing the floors herself? She gets exhausted. Calm down. How come you're back already? I got an awful scare. I nearly hit a little girl in Yonkers. God, why didn't I go to Alaska with my brother Ben that time? There's no use in thinking about that now. There was a man who started with the clothes on his back— - and ended up with diamond mines. I'd like to know how he did that. He knew what he wanted, walked into the jungle— - and came out at the age of 21, a rich man! The world is an oyster, but you don't crack it open on a mattress. I've told you I'll retire you and let you enjoy the rest of your life. You'll retire me for life on 70 goddam dollars a week? You and your women, your car and your apartment. And you'll retire me? Christ's sake! I couldn't get past Yonkers today. Where are you, guys? The woods are burning. I can't even drive a car. How are you? Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. - What's the matter? - I heard a noise. I thought something happened. We need to do something about the walls. You just need to sneeze in here, and hats blow off in my house. Come on, Dad, let's go to bed. You go ahead. I'm not tired. Take it easy. Good night, Charley. - What are you doing up? - Couldn't sleep. I had a heartburn. You don't know how to eat, that's the problem. I chew and swallow, like everybody else. No, you're ignorant. You've got to know about vitamins. Let's play a while, it'll tire you out. What's it with those vitamins? They build up your bones. It's chemistry. - I don't get heartburn in my bones. - Don't try and be witty. I'd be embarrassed if I was as ignorant as you. Don't get angry. Don't talk about things you don't understand. - What are you doing home? - Trouble with the car. You want a job? I've got a job, I've told you that. What the hell are you offering me a job for? I just don't understand it. He's going back to Texas. - What the hell is that? - Let him go. Then what have I got left? You take it too hard. To hell with it. When the bottle is broken, you don't get your nickel back. - That's easy for you to say. - No, it isn't. Did you see the ceiling I put up in the living room? That's nice work. That's a mystery to me. How do you do it? - Why do you ask? - Why don't you tell me? - Are you putting up a ceiling? - How could I do that? Then why are you bothering me? Are you insulted again? A man who can't handle tools is not a man. You're disgusting. Don't call me that. I'm getting tired, Ben. Good, keep playing. You'll sleep better. I just thought you called me Ben. That's funny. For a second you reminded me of my brother Ben. You never heard from him again since he left? Didn't Linda tell you? A couple of weeks ago we got a letter from his wife in Africa. He died. Really? - Maybe you're in for some of his money. - Nah, he had seven sons. I've already had my chance with him. If I'd gone with him to Alaska, everything would have been different. You'd have frozen to death up there. What are you talking about? He understands the... tremendous things. Huh? He's the only man I've ever met who knew the answers. - Who? - We're fine. Excellent. You're lucky tonight. - She died a long time ago. - Who? - Eh? - Who died? - What do you mean? - What are you talking about? - That's my build! - I put the ace. If you don't know how to play, I'm not going to throw my money away on you. What do you mean? It was my ace. I'm through, I'm through. Next time I'll bring a deck with five aces. - No, I don't play that kind of game. - You ought to be ashamed of yourself! - Yeah? - Yeah. Idiot. When he was 21, he came out of the jungle, and he was rich. That's the spirit I want to imbue them with. - What is he doing there? - Just go into the jungle. My God, how long has he been doing this? It'll pass by the morning. Shouldn't we do something? There's so much that should be different. But we can't do anything about it now, so go to sleep. I've never heard him so loud. Come home more often, and you'll hear him. Why didn't you write to me about this? How would I write to you? For over three months, you've had no address. I was on the move. But you know I thought of you, don't you? I know, dear. But your father likes to have a letter. It helps him believe in the possibility for better things. He's not like this all the time. It's when you come home he's always the worst. - When I come home? - Yes. When you write you're coming, he's all smiles, and talks of the future. He's just wonderful. And the closer you seem to come, the more shaky he gets, and then... ...by the time you get here, he's carrying on like this. Why are you so hateful to each other? I'm not hateful, Mom. But you're fighting as soon as you're in the door. I don't know why, I try to change. I mean it. Well... Are you home to stay now? I don't know. I want to look around, see what's going on. You can't look around all your life, Biff. I just can't settle with anything. A man is not a bird who comes and goes with the springtime. - Your hair. - What? Your hair has turned so grey. Oh, it's been grey since you left school. I've just stopped dyeing it, that's all. Dye it again, Mom. I don't want you to look old. You're such a boy. You think you can go away for years and... You've got to get it into your head that one day you'll knock on this door— - and there'll be strange people here. What are you talking about? You're not even 60. - And your father? - Well... I meant him, too. You admire Dad. If you don't have any feeling for him, then you can't have any feeling for me. - Sure I can. - No. You can't just come here to see me. I love him. He's the dearest man in the world to me. And I won't have anyone hurting his feelings— - and making him feel unwanted. You've got to make your mind up. Either he's your father— - and you're kind to him and pay him that respect which... ...you owe him, or else you're not to come here. I know he's not easy to get along with. Nobody knows that better than me. Hey, Biffo! - What the hell is the matter with him? - Let him be. Stop making excuses for him. He's always wiped the floor with you. He's never had an ounce of respect for you. - He's always had respect for you. - What the hell do you know about it? - Just don't call him crazy. - Charley would never act like this. Spewing out that vomit from his mind. Charley never had to cope with the same things as Dad. People are worse off than Willy Loman. Believe me, I've seen them. Then stick to Charley instead. Make him your father. But you can't do that, I know that much. I'm not saying he's a great man. Willy never made a lot of money. His name was never in the paper. But he's a human being, and something terrible is happening to him. So pay attention. He's not to fall into his grave like an old dog. So pay attention. Respect... should be shown such a man. - Calling him crazy? - I didn't mean it. He's exhausted. A small man can be just as exhausted as a big man. This spring he's been with the company for 36 years. He's opened new markets for their trademark— - markets that no one had thought of before. And now in his old age they take his salary away. I didn't know that. - No one's told me. - You've never asked. Now that you get your spending money someplace else— - you don't trouble your mind with him. - But I gave you money. - Last Christmas. 50 dollars. It cost 96.50 to fix the hot water. Those bastards. For five weeks he's been on straight commission— - like a beginner, an unknown. Those bastards. Are they any worse than his own sons? When he brought them business, when he was young, they were glad to see him. But now... All his old friends and business partners— - they loved him so. They always had an order for him in a pinch. They're all dead now, or retired. He drives 700 miles, and when he gets there— - no one knows him, no one welcomes him. What goes through a man's mind, driving 700 miles home again— - without having earned a cent? Why shouldn't he talk to himself? He has to go to Charley and borrow 50 dollars a week— - to pretend to me that it's his pay. Well, how long can that go on for? You see what I'm sitting here waiting for? And then you're telling me he's got no character. He who has worked hard every day for your benefit. This is his reward, looking back at the age of 63— - seeing his sons, who he loved better than his own life! One a lazy skirt-chaser... That's all you are, my boy. And you, what happened to the love you had for him? You were such pals. You used to talk to him on the phone every night. He just couldn't relax until he could get away— - and return home to you. All right. I'll stay here. I'll get a job and stay away from him. You can't stay here and fight with him all the time. He threw me out of this house, remember that. Why did he do that? I never knew. Because I know he's a fake. And he doesn't like having anybody around who knows. Fake? What do you mean? It's between him and me. Just don't lay it all at my feet. I'll stay here and be responsible. He can have half of my pay check, he'll be all right. I'm going to bed. No. He won't be all right. I hate this city and I'll stay! What more do you want? He's dying. - Dying? - What do you mean? - He's been trying to kill himself. - How? - He lives from day to day. - What are you talking about? Remember that I wrote you that he smashed up the car again in February? Yeah. The insurance inspector came. He said that they have evidence that all these accidents the last year... ...weren't accidents. How can they tell that? It's a lie. - No, it seems there is a woman... - What woman? - ...and she... What? - Nothing. Go on. - What did you say? - I just asked what woman. What about her? Well, she... was walking down the road and saw his car. She says he wasn't driving fast at all, and that he didn't skid. She says he came to that little bridge... ...and then deliberately smashed into the railing. It was only the shallowness of the water that saved him. No. No, no... He probably fell asleep again. - I don't think so. - Why not? Last month... Boys... It's so hard to say a thing like this. He's just a big stupid man to you. But I'll tell you, there's so much good in him. I was looking for a fuse. The lights blew out, and I went down the cellar. And behind the fuse-box... it happened to fall out... ...was a piece of rubber pipe. Not long. Not more than this. There's a little attachment on the end of it. Well... I knew right away what it was. And sure enough... Come. On the bottom of the water heater— - there's a new little nipple on the gas pipe. Jerk! - That's it. - Did you remove it? - No, I couldn't. - Why not? How can I mention it to him? Every day I go down and take away that little rubber pipe— - but when he comes home, I put it back again. I don't know what to do. I live from day to day. Believe me... I know every thought in his mind. It might sound old-fashioned and silly. But he's put his whole life into you. - And you've turned your backs on him. - No... Yes, Biff, I'm telling you! I swear to God. His life is in your hands, Biff. How do you like that? No, no, no. No. Mom... Yes. Hey... I'll stay here. I know I've been useless. But I'll be responsible now, I'll start working. Mom, it's just that... I don't fit in business. Don't you see? But I'll try, I'll make it work. It'll definitely be all right. Of course it will, Mom. The trouble with you is that you never tried to please people. - I know. - Like when you worked for Harrison's. Bob Harrison thought highly of you. Then you go and whistle whole songs in the elevator like a comedian. - I like to whistle. - But then you never get promoted. Don't argue about that now. Or when you went off swimming in the middle of the day... Have you never run off on a nice summer's day? Yes, but I cover myself, make sure I have an alibi. Boys, boys... If I'm going to take time off, the boss can call any number— - and they'll swear to him that I just left. - Hap... - Sure. I'll tell you something that I hate to say. In the business world, some people think you're crazy. - Screw the business world. - Sure. - But always cover yourself! - Hap, can't you just be... - ...quiet! - I don't care. They've laughed at Dad for years. You know why? Because we don't belong in this city. We don't belong in this nuthouse of a city. We should be out in the open, mixing cement on some open plain. Or carpenters! A carpenter is allowed to whistle. Even your grandfather was better than a carpenter. You never grew up. That's the trouble with you. Bernard doesn't whistle in the elevator. - But you do. - I've never whistled in an elevator! And who in the business world thinks I'm crazy? I didn't mean it like that. Don't make a thing of it. Go back to Texas and become a carpenter, if that's what you want. - He was just saying... - I heard what he said. Come on, Pop... They laugh at me, eh? Go to Filene's, or wherever in Boston, Slattery's... Go there and call out the name of Willy Loman. You'll see it's the name of a big shot. - I know. - Why do you always insult me? - I didn't say a word. - He didn't say anything, Willy. All right then. Good night. Willy, dear! He has just decided he'll stay here now. If you get tired of hanging around, you can paint the ceiling. - I'm leaving early tomorrow. - He's going to see Bill Oliver! Bill Oliver? For what? - What? - Well... I remembered what Bill Oliver said when I quit. He said that I should come to him if I ever needed help. I was thinking... I'd like to go into business, and maybe he'd like to put up some money. - Isn't that wonderful? - What's wonderful about it? There's 50 men in New York City who'd invest in him! - Sporting goods? - I know something about it. "Know something"? You know sporting goods better than Spalding. - How much is he giving you? - Don't know, I'm going there tomorrow. - Then what are you talking about? - All I said was I'm going to see him. You're counting your chickens again... - Oh, Jesus! - Don't curse in this house! - Since when did you get so proper? - Wait a second! - Don't use that language here. - Wait! - Biff! - Come and sit down. - Let's talk. - Willy! - Let's talk some sense. - Willy. Sit down. When I was in Florida last time, I thought of a great idea— - to sell sporting goods. It just came to me. You and I, Biff, we have a line, the Loman Line. We train a couple of weeks, and put on a couple of exhibitions. - You see? - No... Well... - That's not a bad idea. - Wait! Listen. We form two basketball teams. And two water-polo teams. Then we play each other. It's a million dollars' worth in publicity. Two brothers, see? The Loman Brothers. Displays in the Royal Palms. Well, in all the hotels. And the banners over the ring and the basketball court. The Loman Brothers. Boy, we could really sell sporting goods! - It's worth millions! Marvelous! I'm in great shape, as far as that's concerned. And it wouldn't be like sitting in an office. My God, we would be out playing ball all the time. - Sounds good. - Million dollars... You wouldn't be fed up with it. It'd be the family again. It'd be reliable and friendly. And if you wanted to go for a swim, you'd just do it— - without getting into trouble. What do you say? Boys! The world is at your feet! You two together— - will absolutely dazzle the civilized world. Yeah! Happy, I'll see Oliver tomorrow. If we could work that out... - Maybe things are beginning to... - Stop interrupting! But don't wear a sport jacket and slacks when you see Oliver. - No, I'll... - You need to dress correctly. A business suit. And talk as little as possible, and no jokes. - He did always like me. - He loved you! Will you stop interfering. Be correctly dressed, and stay serious. You're not applying for a boy's job. - No, no. - And no jokes! Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money. I'll try and get some myself. I'm sure I can! Let's really apply ourselves now! Your troubles are over! But remember, start big and you'll end big! - Sure. - Ask for 15,000. - How much are you going to ask for? - Gee, I don't know... "Gee"... That's a boy's word. A man walking in, asking for 15,000, doesn't say "gee". No... - 10 would probably be top... - You're too modest. You've always started too low. Start big. Walk in with a big laugh, totally at ease. Don't look worried. Start off with a couple of your good stories— - to lighten things up. It's not what you say, it's how you say it. Personality always wins the day. Oliver always thought so highly of Biff. - Will you be quiet! - Don't yell at Mom. - She keeps on interrupting. - Just don't yell. - But... - Are you taking over this house? - Willy... - Goddamit... Stop yelling at her! Give my best to Bill Oliver. He may remember me. What did you have to start that for? You saw how sweet he was as soon as you spoke hopefully about the future. Come up and say good night to him. You saw how little it takes to make him happy. Come on, let's go and cheer him up. Just say good night, Biff. It really doesn't take much. Go on. Biff. Your pajamas are hanging in the bathroom, Willy. What a woman. No salary. Straight commission. Yes, God Almighty. Let's face it, he's no hot shot in the business. But he can be very sweet sometimes. You'll have to admit. Lend me 10 bucks. I want to buy some ties. I'll show you a place with great stuff. Wear one of my striped shirts. Mom has gotten so grey and old. - I'll go and see Oliver tomorrow. - Come on, tell that to Dad. Can we do this? With 10,000 bucks! That's the talk. That's the first time I've heard your old confidence. You're going to live with me, all right? And any girl you want, just say the word... Can you do anything about the shower? It drips. Everything falls to pieces at once. It wasn't long ago... ...we had the plumber here. They ought to be sued for not doing a proper job. I wonder if Oliver will remember him. You think so? Remember him? You crazy? If he'd stayed with Oliver, he'd be at the top by now. Wait until Oliver gets a look at him. You don't know what young men are like today. They just want to bum around and do nothing. - Glad to hear it, boy. - He wanted to say good night to you. Knock him out in the first round. What did you want to say? Just take it easy, Dad. It'll be fine. If anything falls off the desk while you're talking to him— - a package or something, don't pick it up. - They have office boys for that. - I'll make a big breakfast tomorrow. Let me finish. Tell him you've been in the business. - No farm work. - No... - Good night, Mom. - It'll be fine. - All will go well. - Good night. Don't undersell yourself. No less than 15,000. You've got a greatness in you, Biff. Remember that. - You're going places. - Sleep well, darling. I'm going to get married, Mom. I wanted to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear. - I just wanted to tell you. Keep it up, boys. My God... Remember that Ebbets Field game? - The finals. - Try to sleep now. Should I sing to you? Yeah, sing to me. When the team came out... He was the tallest and broadest of them all. Like Hercules, something like that. And the sun all around him. He waved to me. Remember that? Right up on the field— - with representatives of three colleges standing by. And the buyers were sitting next to me. And the cheers when he came out. "Loman! Loman! Loman!" He'll be great yet. A star like that can never really fade away. You look so rested, dear. I slept like a dead one. First time in months. Imagine, sleeping till ten on a Tuesday morning? - Have the boys left? - They were out by eight o'clock. Biff was so changed. His whole attitude seemed hopeful. He couldn't wait to get downtown to see Oliver. He's definitely heading for a change. There's no question. So... Gee. On my way home tonight I'd like to buy some seeds. That'd be wonderful, but not enough sun gets back here. Nothing will grow any more. You wait. We haven't seen the end yet. One day we'll have a little place out in the country. Here, I've mended the lining. I might build a little guest house. - There. - They're starting a family... Did he decide how much he's going to ask Oliver for? He didn't mention it. I imagine 10 or 15,000. Promise me you'll talk to Howard today. I'll put it to him straight and simple. He'll just have to take me off the road. Don't forget to ask for an advance. We need to pay our insurance premium. It's the grace period. - That's 105... - No, 108.68.xx - We're a little short. - Why? - You had the motor job on the car. - That goddam Studebaker! And we've got one more payment on the refrigerator. - But it just broke again. - It's old, dear. I told you we should have bought a well-known machine. - We couldn't afford it. - Charley bought a General Electric. It's 20 years old, and it's still good. That lucky bastard. Hastings refrigerator. Whoever heard of that? Once in my life I'd like to own something before it's broken. I'm always in a race with the junkyard. 200 dollars would do us. They time them, so that when you've finally paid them, they're used up. Willy. About 200 dollars would carry us. That includes the last payment on the mortgage, then the house is ours. It's 25 years! - Well, I'm late. - Bye-bye. Oh, I almost forgot. They want to treat you to dinner tonight. - Me? - Sure, at Frank's Chop House. On 48th, near Sixth Avenue. - How about you? - No. Just the three of you. Don't say. Who thought of that? Biff told me this morning, "Tell Dad we want to treat him to a big dinner." - Be there at six o'clock. - All right. Just wait till I get to speak to Howard. I'll come home with a New York job and an advance in my pocket. That's the spirit, Willy. I will never get behind the wheel for the rest of my life. It's changing. I can feel it changing. Yeah. It's late, I've got to run. You got your glasses? I've got them in my pocket. - And your handkerchief. - Did I forget that? There. Be careful on the subway stairs. Will you stop mending stockings? At least while I'm in the house. It makes me nervous. Don't know why. - Well. Remember Frank's Chop House. - Sure! Hey. Maybe I'll sow some beets out here. But you've tried so many times. - Don't work too hard today. - Don't worry. Bye-bye. Be careful. Hello, children! - Howard? - Is that you, Willy? Come in. I would like to have a little talk with you, Howard. - What's that? - Haven't you seen one of these? - A wire recorder. - Oh? Do you have a minute? It records things, anything. I got it yesterday. The most amazing machine I ever saw. I was up all night with it. - What do you do with it? - I got it for dictation. But you can do anything with it. Listen to what I've recorded. The first one is my daughter. - Listen to her whistle. - It's as if she was here in the room. She's only seven. What an ear for music. I'd like to talk to you about something. - Now you, Daddy. - She's crazy for me. - That's me. - Really? You're very good. And this is my son. The capital of Alabama is Montgomery. The capital of Arizona is Phoenix. The capital of Arkansas is Little Rock. The capital of California is... - Five years old! - He'll make an announcer one day. - Alphabetical order. - It's fantastic. Be quiet. Here's my wife. Go on, say something. Anything. Come on, it's turning. - Hello. - That was my wife. - Aren't you supposed to be in Boston? - That's what I wanted to talk about. - Do you have a moment? - What happened? Why are you here? - Well... - You didn't smash up the car again? - Oh no. - You had me worried there. - What's the trouble then? - Well... I'll tell you the truth, I've been thinking about it a lot. I'd rather not travel any more. - Not travel? What would you do? - Remember the Christmas party? You said you'd think of a job for me here in town. - At the office? - Don't you remember? Oh, yeah! Well... I just couldn't think of anything for you. The boys are all grown up. I don't need much any more. If I could make 65 dollars a week, I'd be all right. - You see, Willy... - I'll tell you why... I'm actually a little tired. Well... Sure, I can understand that. It's not surprising. But you're a road man, Willy, and we do road business. We don't need more than six salesmen here. God knows I'm not the one to beg for my sick mother— - but I've been with the firm since your father used to carry you in his arms. I know, but... He came to me when you were born to ask me what I thought of the name Howard. - May he rest in peace. - I know, and I appreciate that. But you've got to admit, business is business. Yes, of course. But just listen to me for a minute, I don't think you understand. When I was no more than 18, 19, I was already on the road. But I wasn't sure if selling was the future for me. My father lived many years in Alaska, he was an adventurous man. I thought I'd go out with my older brother— - to try to locate him, and maybe settle there for good. I see. I was almost decided to go— - when I happened to meet an old salesman. His name was Dave Singelman, and he was 84 years old. Old Dave was selling in 31 states. You should have seen him. He arrived at the hotel— - went up to his room and put on his green velvet slippers. I'll never forget. Then he picked up the phone— - and called the buyers. 84 years old, he never had to leave his room. He could sit there, peacefully, and conduct his business. He made a good living. That's when I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could have. He died the death of a salesman, in his green velvet slippers— - on the New York-Hartford train going into Boston. Hundreds of salesmen and buyers came to his funeral. Things were sad on a lot of trains for months after that. In those days, there was personality in it. There was respect, warmth, and comradeship. Today there's nothing like that. Don't you understand? It's like they don't know me any more. No... that's just the thing. If I had 40 dollars a week, that's all I need. Old friend, I can't get blood from a stone. The year Al Smith was nominated, your father came to me... I've got to see some people... I'm talking about your father! Promises were made across this desk. Don't tell me you've got people to see. I put 34 years into this firm, and now I can't pay my insurance. You can't eat the apple and throw away the core. A man is not a piece of fruit. Listen up. In 1928 I had a big year. I averaged 170 dollars a week in commissions. - No, Willy, you never averaged... - 170 dollars a week in commissions! - Listen to me! - Hey, Willy. - I've got to get myself some coffee. - Look, Willy. - I'll go to Boston. - No. You can't. Why can't I go? I don't want you to represent us. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time. Do you mean... you're firing me? I think you need a long good rest. Howard... Come back when you feel better, and we'll see if we can work something out. - I've got to earn money... - What about your sons? You've got two boys. They're working on a very big deal. This is no time for false pride. You go to your sons and tell them that you're tired. All right? - Sure, but... - Then that's that. - I'll go to Boston tomorrow. - No, you won't. I can't throw myself on my sons. I'm no cripple. - Look, I'm really busy this morning. - Howard! You've got to let me go to Boston. I've got a line of people to see. Important meetings. Sit down, take five minutes and pull yourself together. Then go home. I need my office for other things. Oh yes. I nearly forgot... Whenever you can this week, stop by and drop off the samples. You'll feel better with a little bit of rest. Then come back and we'll talk. Hello? Oh, is that you, Biff? Nice of you to call. Hey, I had... Sorry? No, I didn't forget. He'll be there at six o'clock. I wanted to tell you something. You know that rubber pipe I told you about in the cellar? It's gone. He threw it away himself. Sorry? When? I see. So you took care of it? Huh? No, I was just so pleased that he'd done it himself. No... I'm not at all worried. He was in an excellent mood this morning. Did you see Oliver? No? Ah well. I suppose you'll have to wait, I'm sure he's a very busy man. I hope you'll have a nice time tonight with your father. And make sure you're sweet to him. That's good of you. It could save his life. Hey, put your arm around him and be really happy when you meet him. Yes... That's kind of you, Biff. Very well. Did you bring your comb? Yes. Goodbye then. Bernard. Bernard! Would you mind going out to talk to him? - Sorry? Who? - Mr. Loman. - Who is he talking to? - Nobody. He's talking to himself. I have a lot of typing to do, letters that must go today. And your father gets all upset every time he comes. ...touchdown! Just wait and see. Jenny, good to see you. How are you? Fine. How have you been feeling? Not great these days. It's not working out very well. - Hello, Uncle Willy. - Bernard? - What are you doing here? - Just stopped by to see Dad. - I'm off to Washington in a little bit. - Is he in? Sure, he's in his office with the accountant. Why don't you sit down for awhile? What are you going to do in Washington? Nothing much. I just have a few errands up there. - You're going to play tennis. - That's right. I'm staying with a friend who's got a court. You don't say. His own tennis court? - Must be fine people. - They are, very nice people. Dad tells me Biff's in town. That's right. He's working on something big. We're having dinner together today. Didn't I hear your wife had a boy? - That's right. Our second. - Two boys! Time sure flies. What kind of a deal has Biff got? Well, you know Bill Oliver... very big in sporting goods. He wants Biff badly. He called him in from the West. Long distance, carte blanche. Fantastic offer. Your friends have their own tennis court? And you... Are you still with the old firm? Bernard, I'm overjoyed to see how well you've done. It's encouraging to see a young man... It looks very good for Biff now. Excellent. Bernard... - What's the secret? - Huh? - What secret? - How did you do it? And why did he just give up like that? I wish I had the answer. You were his childhood friend. There's something I don't understand. It's as if his life ended after that Ebbets Field game. From the age of 17, nothing good ever happened to him. Well... Biff never trained himself for anything. But he did. After high school he took so many correspondence courses. Radio mechanics, television... God knows what. - But nothing ever came of it. - Do you want me to talk frankly? You're a talented, sensible young man. I value your advice... I don't have any advice for you. There's just one thing I've always wanted to ask you. When he was supposed to graduate, and the math teacher flunked him... That son-of-a-bitch ruined his life. All he had to do was to go to summer school, and he would have made it. That's right. Why didn't he? Did you tell him not to go to summer school? Me? I begged him to go, I ordered him to go! Then why wouldn't he go? Why? Why? I've been asking me this for 15 years. Why did he just give up? What was the reason behind it? You were his best friend. I remember it was June, and our grades came out. And he'd flunked math. - That son-of-a-bitch... - That's when it happened. Biff was very angry, but he was ready to enroll in summer school. - He was? - Sure. He wasn't beaten by it. But... ...then something happened. He disappeared for almost a month. I got the idea that he'd gone up to New England to see you. Did he? Willy. Yeah... he came to Boston. What about it? It's just that... when he came back after that month away... Well, you remember how much I liked Biff? Even if he did take advantage of me. When he came back after that month, he took his sneakers... Remember those with "University of Virginia" printed on them? He was so proud of those. He took them down to the cellar, and burned them in the furnace. We got into a fight down there. It lasted for at least half an hour. Just the two of us in the cellar. Can you imagine? Us punching each other and yelling right out. I've often thought of how strange it was— - that I somehow knew he'd given up his life. What happened in Boston, Willy? Willy? What do you mean? Why are you asking me? I'm just wondering... Why are you asking me what happened? Don't get sore now... Surely it's not my fault if a young man gives up? - I didn't mean to embarrass you. - Hurry up, or you'll miss your train. Yeah, I'd better be leaving. Thanks, Dad. Goodbye, Willy. Don't worry too much about it. One must never give up. Yes, I believe in that. But sometimes it's better for a man to just walk away. - Walk away? - That's right. But if you can't walk away? - That's when it's tough. Goodbye. - Goodbye, boy. How do you like this kid? He's going to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court. - Dad! - No! The Supreme Court! - I've got to run. Bye. - The Supreme Court... - He didn't even mention it. - There's no need. He'll just do it. And you never told him what to do. You never took any interest in him. It's my salvation that I never took any interest in anything. Here's 50 dollars. I've got someone waiting inside. Charley. I've got my insurance to pay today. If you can manage it, I would need 110 dollars. - I'd take it from the bank, but... - Sit down. - Listen to me, Willy. - I'm keeping an account of everything. - I'll pay you back... - How are you doing? - Don't think I don't appreciate it. - What's going on in your head? Why? Well, I simply... I've offered you a job, you can make 50 dollars a week. And you never have to travel. - I already have a job. - Without pay. What kind of job is a job without pay? Enough is enough. I'm no genius, but I know when I'm being insulted. - Insulted? - Why won't you work for me? - I have a job already! - Then why are you here every week? I can leave, if you don't want me here. - I'm offering you a job. I don't want your goddam job! When the hell are you going to grow up? Say that to me again, and I'll hit you. I don't care how big you are! How much do you need, Willy? Charley... I'm finished. Yes, finished. I just got fired. - Howard fired you? - Yeah. That snotnose. I named him. I named him Howard. You need to realize that those things don't mean anything. You may have named him, but you can't sell that. The only thing you've got in this world is what you can sell. It's funny, you're a salesman and you don't know that. I know you don't like me. And nobody can say that I'm in love with you, but... ...I want to give you a job because... Well, just for the hell of it. Let's just put it that way. - What do you say? - I can't work for you. Why not? Are you jealous of me? I can't work for you, that's all, don't ask me why. You've been jealous of me all your life, you damned fool! - Here, pay your insurance. - I'm keeping strict accounts. I've got to go now. Take care, Willy. And pay your insurance. It's funny. After all the hard work and the travelling— - you end up worth more dead than alive. Nobody's worth anything dead. Remember that. - Do you hear me? Willy? - Yeah, yeah... Give my best to Bernard. He's a fine boy. I didn't mean to argue with him. I'm sure you'll see him soon. They're all fine boys. It'll go well for all of them. Someday they'll all play tennis together. Hey... Wish me luck, Charley. - Biff is seeing Bill Oliver today. - Good luck with Bill. Charley... You're the only friend I've got. Isn't that remarkable? Jesus! Would you object to a compliment from a stranger? You ought to be on a magazine cover. I have been. Stanley! What did I say? She's a cover girl. I'm not surprised. That's obvious. Here you go. - Which magazine? - A lot of them. Cheers. You know what they say in France? "Drink champagne for your complexion." Cheers. - Hiya, Biff. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. - I just got here myself. Sorry, Miss...? - Forsythe. - Miss Forsythe, this is my brother. - Is Dad not here? - His name's Biff. You might have heard of him, great football star. Really? What team? - Are you familiar with football? - No, I'm afraid not. He's quarterback with the New York Giants. Perhaps I ought to introduce myself as well. I'm Happy. - It's really Harold. - Isn't Dad coming? But at West Point they called me Happy. - You want her? - Come on, I could never get her. You'd never think like that in the old days. Happy, I just saw Oliver. Wait a minute. I'd like to see your old confidence. She's there if you want her. Wait. Honey? Are you busy? Well, I am... - But I could make a phone call. - Yes, do that. And see if you can get a friend as well. We'll be here for awhile. Biff is one of the greatest football players in America. - It sounds like a great idea. - Sure! - Come back soon. - I'll try. Try hard. That's why I can't get married. There's not a good woman in a thousand. - Hap, look... - I told you you could have her! - Cut it out, will you? - What? I want to talk to you. - Did you see Oliver? - I saw him all right. I want to tell Dad a couple of things, and I want you to help me. - Did you get the money? - Are you crazy? Why, what happened? I did a terrible thing today. I feel all strange. - You mean he wouldn't see you? - No, I saw him. I waited six hours for him. All day, you see? Kept sending my name in. - He didn't remember you? - Finally he came out. He didn't remember anything. I felt like an idiot. Did you tell him my Florida idea? Then he walked off. I saw him for about a minute. How the hell did I ever get the idea that I was a salesman there? I even believed myself that I'd been a salesman for Oliver. And then he gave me one look... ...and I realized that we've all been living a lie for 15 years. I was a shipping clerk, that's all. - What did you do? - He left. And then the secretary went out, and I was all alone. The next thing I know... ...I was in his office. I can't explain it. Paneled walls, everything. The next thing I know... - I took his fountain pen. - Did he catch you? No, I ran down all 11 flights... - What did you do that for? - I don't know. I just wanted to take something. I'm going to tell Dad. Are you crazy? What for? He's got to understand that I'm not the sort of man you lend money to. - He thinks I've been spiting him. - So you should tell him something else. No, I can't. Say you've got a lunch date with Oliver tomorrow. What do I say tomorrow? You leave the house in the morning and come back at night. Say Oliver is thinking it over. And he thinks it over for a couple of weeks— - and gradually it fades away, and nobody's the worse off. But it'll go on forever. Dad is never so happy as when he's looking forward to something. - Here they are! - Gee, I haven't been here in years. - Hi, Dad. - Hello. Sit down. - Do you want a drink? - Sure, that'd be nice. - Let's have something strong. - One moment, please. - You don't look too good today. - I'm fine. - Scotch all around, make it doubles. - Doubles, right. - You've started already. - Yeah. - I just had a couple. - Well, what happened? All went well? Dad... I had a strange experience today. - Terrific. - That so, what happened? It's been a strange old day. I'll tell you everything right from the start. I had to wait for him. - Oliver? - Yeah, Oliver. All day, as a matter of fact. Six hours. And while I was there, a lot of memories came to me. Incidents, facts. Facts about my life. Dad... Whoever said I was a salesman for Oliver? - You were. - No, I was a clerk. I don't know who said it first, but I was nothing but a clerk. - Do you understand? - What are you talking about? Let's stick to facts tonight. You shouldn't pretend to be something you're not. I was nothing but a shipping clerk. I'm not interested in stories of the past. That crap doesn't mean anything, because the woods are burning. The woods are burning, don't you understand? There's a big blaze going on all around. - I was fired today. - Impossible. Gentlemen, doubles are served. I wish you a pleasant evening. Here you go. Doubles. Thank you. It's impossible. Impossible. I was fired. The only thing that interests me now— - is bringing home some good news for your mother. She has suffered enough. Remember that, boys. I can't think of anything. My mind is a blank. Don't try and teach me about cold facts. They don't interest me. So, what do you say? - Didn't you see Oliver? - Jesus... - Didn't you go? - Sure he was up there. - How could he fire you? - He welcomed you, didn't he? He's a good man. And it's not easy to get to see him. - I know. - Did you sit down in his office? - No, he came out... - And then he saw you. - He put his arms around you, didn't he? - No. He... He said... You won't let me say what I want to say. - You didn't see Oliver. - I did see him. You probably talked too much, as usual. - For Christ's sake! - Let me... - Tell me! - There's no use talking to him. You won't listen. - Biff, tell him. - I tried. - Why did you flunk math? - What are you talking about? Aunt Linda! If you hadn't flunked, all would have been fine. Flunked? What are you talking about? Don't lay it all on me. I'm not the one who flunked! Calm down. I'll tell you what happened. I'll start from the beginning. Now I need you to listen. - I had to wait six hours for Oliver. - What the hell! Shut up, Hap. Six hours— the whole day, in fact. In the end he came, but he didn't remember me. I felt like an idiot. Aunt Linda! - Yes? - Biff flunked math. - Oh no... - They won't graduate him. They have to, he's going to university. Where is he? - Biff! - He went to Grand Central. - Did he go to Boston? - Is Uncle Willy in Boston? Yeah! Maybe Willy can talk to the teacher. - You stole Bill Oliver's... - I've tried to explain it to you. - You've stolen Bill Oliver's... - No! I haven't stolen... He had it in his hand when Oliver walked in— - so he got nervous and stuck it in his pocket. I never intended it, Dad. - I'm not in my room. I'm not here. - What's the matter? - Sit down. - Dad, calm down. - I'm not here! I'm not answering! - Some good news, Dad. Hey, Mr. Oliver said he'd talk to his partner about the Florida idea. Are you listening? It's just a question of the amount. - Then you got it? - He'll be a success in no-time. No, wait. I'm supposed to have lunch with them tomorrow. And... I'm telling you this so that you'll know— - that I can still make an impression on people. But I can't go tomorrow, you understand. I can't go there, see? - Of course you're going! - I can't. - You're going to the lunch. - But the pen, Dad! The pen. You are going to that lunch tomorrow. - I can't. There is no lunch. - For Christ's sake! - You damned fool! - Calm down! Hello, girls! Welcome. Sit down. Welcome! Take a seat. Want something to drink? - Letta won't be able to stay long. - How come? I need to get up early tomorrow. I've got jury duty. I'm so excited. Were you ever on a jury? Jury? No, but I've been in front of one. This is my father. - Isn't he cute? Sit down here with us. - Sit him down, Biff. Let's go and drink ourselves under the table. - Come, let's sit down. - The door... The bathroom. Bathroom? - How sweet to bring your daddy along. - Well, what would you like to do? - We're wasting time. - Perhaps we'll go someplace else. - A drink? - Let's go somewhere. Biff, where do you want to go? Would you like a cigarette? Oh, excuse me. Sorry. - Thank you. - All right? Of course. - There you go. - Thanks. - Why don't you do something for him? - Me? - Don't you give a damn about him? - I'm the one who takes care of him. I've noticed. Do you know what I found in the cellar? Can you see what it is? How can you bear to let it go on? - Sorry. - Huh? What are you talking about? Who runs off all the time? You could help him, I can't. I can't bear to look at his face. - Well... Where did he go? - Yeah... - Let's catch up with him. - Yeah. Don't you think we should tell your dad first? No, he's not my dad. He's just an acquaintance. We'll catch up with Biff, then we'll paint this town. Stanley! He heard us talking in here. Maybe the hotel's on fire. It's probably a mistake. Why don't you tell him to go away? It's getting on my nerves. All right. Stay in the bathroom, and don't come out. I think there might be a law in Massachusetts about it. Go to the bathroom, and don't come out. It may be the new clerk. He didn't seem very nice. Biff! - Why didn't you answer? - What are you doing in Boston? I've been knocking for five minutes, and I called on the phone... I was in the... I didn't hear you until now. I was in the bathroom and had the door shut. Did anything happen at home? - Dad... I let you down. - Biff... What do you mean? - Dad... - Let's go down and get us something. - I flunked math. - You failed? Yeah. I didn't make the grade. - Bernard wouldn't help you? - He tried. But I only got 61. They wouldn't give you the four points? Birnbaum is impossible. I've begged him. But he's refusing to do it. You've got to talk to him before school starts. If he saw the kind of man you are— - and you talked to him in your way... - You have to talk to him. - Well, let's do it. - We'll drive right back. - Thank you, Dad! I'm sure he'll change it for you. Go downstairs and tell the clerk I'm checking out. Yes, sir! Dad! See, the reason he hates me... one day he was late for class. So I got up and imitated him. Crossed my eyes and talked with a lisp. - The kids liked it, huh? - They nearly died laughing. "The thquare root of thixthy twee is..." In the middle of it he walked in. You'd better hurry downstairs... - Somebody in there? - Huh? It's the room next door. - There's someone in your bathroom. - It's the next room. There's a party there. The thquare root of thixthy twee... You'd better go back to your room, they must be finished painting it. They're painting her room, so I let her shower here. Go back to your room now. This is... But I've got to get dressed. I can't go out like this. This is Miss Francis, she's a buyer. They're painting her room. - Go back to your room, Miss Francis. - What about my clothes? I can't go out there all naked. Go back... - The thquare root... - Please, just go back. And my stockings? - You promised me stockings, Willy. - I have no stockings here. You had two boxes of size ten sheers for me. I want them. The thquare root of thixthy... Here, for God's sake. Will you just go! Go. I just hope there's nobody in the hall. That's all I hope. What do you play? - Football or baseball? - Football. Me, too. We'd better get going. I want to get to the school first thing in the morning. You can get my clothes out of the closet, I'll get the case. What's the matter? She's a buyer for Simmons. She was just here because they're painting her room. I let her shower here. Surely, you don't think... Listen to me, Biff. She's a buyer. They're painting her room. She sees merchandise in there. Get my clothes now, Biff! Stop crying! Do as I say. I gave you an order! You gave her... Mama's stockings. Biff, come back! Biff! Come back, Biff! There! Let's stand up now. It's an order! It's an order! Please, stand up. Dear God... Mr. Loman? - Huh? - Come here. How are you? Are you all right? Your sons left with the girls. They said they'll see you at home. But we were supposed to have dinner together. Well... Can I help you in any way? Perhaps call a cab? - Huh? - Shall I call a cab, Mr. Loman? - Here's a dollar. - Your son's already paid me. Please... There's no need. I assure you... Please, Mr. Loman. It's all been paid for. - Is there a seed store around here? - Seed store? You mean for planting? Yes. Carrots, peas... I see. There are hardware stores on Sixth Avenue— - ...but they might have closed. - I'll have to hurry. I've got to get some seeds, nothing's been planted... What are you looking at? She's not up. What are you doing up? Where's Dad? - Is he asleep? - Where... have you been? We met two girls, very fine girls. I brought you some flowers. Put them in your room. What did you do that for? We wanted to give you flowers. Don't you care whether he lives or dies? - Let's go to bed. - You go. What do you mean? Nobody's dying around here. - Get out of my sight. - No, I want to talk to Dad. Don't you dare. Leave him in peace. You invite him to dinner. He looks forward to it all day. And then... you desert him there. You wouldn't do that to a stranger. Come on... We had a great time. - I would never ever... - Get out of here. - Now look, Mom! - Did you have to go to women tonight? You and your whores. We were just trying to cheer Biff up a bit. Boy, you were in great shape tonight! Get out of here, both of you! I don't want you hurting him any more than you already have. Go on! Get your things together. You can stay in his apartment. Pick up this stuff. I'm not your maid any more. I said, pick it up! You're like... You're like... Nobody else would be as cruel as you two were— - walking out on him in that restaurant... - Is that what he said? - He didn't have to say anything... He was so humiliated. He hardly made it through the door. - He had a great time with us. - Shut up! And you... Biff, you didn't even go to see if he was all right. No, I didn't. I didn't do a damned thing. I left him babbling in a restaurant toilet. - You louse! - Now you hit it on the nose. The scum of the earth, and you're looking at him! - Get out. - No. - I want to have a brief talk with him. - You're not talking to him. - Will you please leave him alone? - What's he doing out there? - He's planting in the garden. - Now? Oh, my God. Carrots... quarter-inch apart. One-foot rows. One foot... Lettuce. An inch apart... Beets... What a proposition. A terrific business idea. Brilliant. You can't come out of the jungle as empty-handed as when you left. You have to have something to show for it. You have to... It's a guaranteed 20,000-dollar proposition. You understand? I've worked like a dog to make every payment in time. Is it gutsier to stay here and be worth nothing? He thinks I'm nothing, that's why he is like that. But at the funeral, when all my friends come from all over the place— - then he'll be thunderstruck. He never realized that I'm known! Where's that other bag? It's so dark here. Those goddam apartment houses block all the light. I'm saying goodbye to you, Dad. I'm not coming back any more. - But you're seeing Oliver tomorrow. - He didn't ask me. He put his arm around you, and you've got no appointment? No, Dad. Let's clear this up once and for all. Every time I've left, it's been because we've had a fight. Today I realized something about myself. I've tried to explain it, but I know I'm not doing a good job of it. But... To hell with whose fault it is, or anything like that. - Come on, let go inside to Mom. - No, I don't want to talk to her. - Come on. - Did you plant, dear? It's been decided. I'm leaving, and I'm not writing any more. I think it's for the best, dear. If people ask where I am or what I'm doing... ...you don't know. Before long you've forgotten. What do you say? It's settled. Aren't you going to wish me luck? Shake his hand, Willy. - He doesn't have to mention the pen. - I have no appointment with Oliver. But he put his arm around you. No, it's no use. You'll never see what I am, Dad. Never. Never. If I strike oil, I'll send you a check. - So spiteful! - No. - Shake my hand. - No, I won't. May you rot in hell if you leave this house! What is it you want from me? Wherever you go, I want you to know that you ruined your life for spite! Pure spite, remember that! And don't you dare blame it on me! - I'm not blaming you. - I won't have you do it! You're trying to put the knife in me. Don't think I don't know that. All right, then. Let's have all the cards on the table. - No! - Leave it there! What is it? - You know goddam well what it is. - I've never seen it. Yes, you have. Look. The mice didn't bring this into the cellar. What were you going to do? Make a hero of yourself— - so that I would have to feel sorry for you? - I've never seen it before. - I have no pity for you. - No pity. - You hear the spite! No, Dad. I'll tell you the truth about you and me. - Cut it out! - Pure spite! He doesn't know who we are. The man's got to know. We never told the truth for more than five minutes in this house. - We always told the truth. - Are you the assistant buyer? Are you even the assistant's assistant? - I'm practically... - You're practically full of it. We all are, and I've had enough! I've had enough! - I'll tell you who I am. - I know who you are. You know why I haven't had an address for three months? I stole a suit in Kansas City and I was in jail. - No... - Stop crying. I suppose that's my fault. I stole myself out of every good job since high school. And whose fault is that? I never got anywhere because you blew me so full of hot air— - I could never stand taking orders from anybody. - That's whose fault it is. - I hear that. - Don't... - It's about time he heard this! I had to be the big boss in two weeks! I've had enough. I've had enough. I'm a nobody, and so are you. I'm not a nobody! I'm Willy Loman and you're Biff Loman! I'm not a leader of men, and neither are you. You're just a poor hard-working soul, who has to toil all your life— - before being thrown away, like everybody else. And I'm not worth more than a dollar an hour. Did you hear me? I tried seven states, but I couldn't raise it! I'm not bringing home any prizes any more, so stop expecting it! You spiteful bastard! Dad... Dad. I'm nothing. I'm nothing, Dad. I'm nothing but a goddam loser. There's no spite in it. That's just how it is. - Why are you crying? - That's just how it is. Why is he crying? Will you let go of me? Let go of me. Stop it, Dad. Stop those phony dreams before something happens. I'll go in the morning. Help him to bed, Happy. Isn't it wonderful? He likes me. - He loves you. - He always did, Dad. Come up to bed now. Everything is settled. Willy, I think this is the best way. The only way... Go to bed, Linda. You look so tired. - Are you coming? - In a few minutes. Go to bed. Willy? Are you coming? Willy! Dad. I don't understand. Where are all the people he knew? All his friends and contacts? Maybe they blame him. I don't understand. For the first time in 35 years we're free and clear. He only needed a few dollars a week. He was even finished with the dentist. He had the wrong dreams, they were all wrong. - You're wrong. - He never knew who he was. There's more of him in that front stoop he built— - ...than in all the sales he ever did. - Don't say that. - Why don't you come with me, Happy? - I don't give up so easily. I'm going to show everybody that Willy Loman didn't die in vain. Come, let's go. I'll be with you in a little while. I want to, just for a minute. I never had a chance to say goodbye. Forgive me, dear. I can't cry. I don't know what it is, but... I just can't cry. It's as if you're on one of your trips. And I'm waiting for you, as usual. Forgive me, Willy. I can't cry. Why did you do it? However hard I try, I'll never understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today. Today, dear. And there'll be nobody home. We're free and clear. We're free. - Come. - We're free. Come. Come on! Let's go now. Come, Mom. Come on. Come on. Come. Come on.
