- Where? - At the bottom. How heavy it is! It must be books. You'd have taken the cart. Marco! Marco, where are you? Marco, that's my name. Here I am, Mom! Where have you been? I've been calling you for a long time. Mom! - Is this my house? - Sure. It's mine, so it's also yours. Will we live here forever? How do I know? Come on, go play. When I call you, answer! - Anything else on the truck? - Almost nothing. - Lay these on the ground. - Yes. Not all of them, just these on top. - Are we going to leave these here? - Yes. In the lobby there are some boxes. Take them to the kitchen. Slowly, please. It's fragile stuff. All right. Marco, what are you doing? Are you hunting mice? Do you like the new house? - Will we here forever? - Maybe. For quite a while anyway. Are we going to be here for the rest of our lives? Who can tell? Why do you care so much? In case someone asks me. Thank you and best wishes for the new house. Goodbye. Dora. Did I scare you, dear? Don't be so nervous. There is no reason, it's been seven years. I know, but I had the feeling of seeing him in front of me. Dora, we made a pact. Bruno, what are you doing? Come on! I have to hang the swing to him. Are you coming too? I have to make dinner. Please, you've been working too hard. We've put enough away. Smile, be cheerful and don't think about the past. - Are you coming? - I'll join you in a little while. You're already up there, huh? Good. We must choose a nice strong branch. - This one. - Yeah, that might work as well. It's the sturdiest one in the garden. Come down, I'll try it. Yes, that one! I want that one! Do you want it so bad? Yes, why not? It's strong. Come on! - Higher! - Yes. Go! - Are you happy? - Well done! Are you done yet? - Come on, Dora! Give us a hand. - Come on, Mom! - Go! - Come on! Landing! - Now you, come on! - Me! - You're welcome, ma'am. - Push hard, eh? Go, fast! Help, dinner! Marco, let's go too or everything will burn. Come on! Come on, eat this too. - I'm full. - It's the last one for mom. Now we have a garden, can I have a dog? You promised, a police dog or a Lessie with long long hair, like mom's hair. What beautiful compliments! Thank you. Now let's leave the dogs alone, it is time to go to bed. - Obey. - But I'm on vacation. Be a good boy and go to bed. You are very tired. All right, I got it. Come on! - Good night. - Good night. - Can I keep the light on? - All right, but just for tonight. He finally fell asleep. It's not a crystal cup, anyway... - Cheers. - Cheers. Sorry about today, I was nervous. Many years have passed since Carlo's suicide, but to return to this house where I lived with him was like reopening a period of my life, but now I'm fine. With you near I feel that the past is really over. - Marco is happy too. - Of course, you spoil him. He adores you. He loves you more than me. I was right not to let you sell the house, it's close to the airport. More. - Where are you going this time? - To London. Then you'll be back in the day. I must organize the basement but I can't find the key. - We'll find it. Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! You can't catch me! You can't catch me! - Yes, run, see if I catch you! - You won't make it! You'll see! You'll see if I catch you! I run faster! Got you! Help! No, stop! Enough! - Shall we take a walk in the park? - Yes! - No one will be able to save you. - I'm the queen! In the afterlife there are no kings and queens, we are all equal. My soldiers will arrest you, I will lock you up in the tower! No one can arrest me. No one can lock me up because I'm like air, invisible. - But I see you. - Because I want to. Only you see me and you must obey my commands. No, never! - Marco, let's go home. - No, wait. Doesn't it scare you? Then you can't sleep tonight. No, it amuses me so much. Mom! Marco, honey, what's wrong? Mom, why my daddy never comes to see me? Marco, you're great, you can understand by now. Your father really liked the sea. He liked to go alone with his sailboat, in the rain, in the wind. Last time he never came back, he died. But why? What does it mean to be dead? To be dead means going away forever. It means that we can never see your daddy again. But why? The reason for certain things can't be explained. If you continue to love him you will always have him close to you. What are you still doing up at this hour? Can I sleep with you tonight? Aren't you ashamed? You are big and you want to sleep with mummy. Please. Okay. - Why are you having a party? - It's not a party like you mean. - Only friends will be coming. - Why? They are friends we haven't seen in a long time. - I dislike them. - So silly. How can you say that if you don't know them? Where is Bruno? When does he arrive? Later. Let's go get pick him up at the airport. Hi, Marco! - Hello, young man. How are you? - I'm good. You? Very well. Thanks for coming to pick me up. Why do you always leave and don't stay to play with me? I have to work. Here, this is your gift. A chewing gum? This is not the gift you bought me. Then what gift did I give you? - I know what you bought me. - Do you? - Hi, Dora. - Hi. Tell me where the dog is! How did you guess it? You must wait, they're shipping it from London. - Want? - Thank you. - Want to drink? - Later, thank you. Not the ones below, one of those there. - You look so good! - Yes, she looks great. - I knew you would be back with us. - We've missed you. Thank you. - What's up, Aldo? Here you go. - Thank you. - You're back to your old self. - I sure hope so. Best wishes. - Doctor. - Yes? What intensive care did you give her? Me? None. I haven't had her in treatment for a long time. She looks relaxed, serene. She doesn't look like a woman who drove a man to suicide. That's a tasteless statement. You can't even joke about it. Why are you taking it so hard? Carlo's death was not a joke. Dora suffered a lot. She should have expected something like this. Even before she married him she knew Carlo used heroine. See these notches? Each notch is a monkey killed with a blowgun. - What part of Africa is he from? - I don't know. Your father will know. Bruno is not my father, he is the new husband of my mother. Don't you know? - What's the matter? Are you bored? - No, I'm jealous. You're never with me. At least wait until we're gone! Why don't you kick them all out? Mother. I have to kill you. - What happened? - Did you hurt yourself? No, it's nothing. - The light went out and I fell. - You're bleeding! It's nothing, don't worry. - It needs to be medicated. - We'll disinfect. Get the alcohol. Score two more points. Your turn, Paolo. I'm not in good shape. When you come back from a long flight, you don't know if it's day or night. - Yeah, good excuse! - More points for you, Bruno! - I don't want any presents. My turn. Luckily your opponent is crappier than you. Dora, what is it? I see you worried. I don't have anything, maybe just a little headache. Are you sure that's all? Can I help you? You were cheerful before. Excuse me, please. Is coffee ready? It's late, I have to go. Damn! I can't get anything right anymore. Look. You're too nervous. I'd like to see you in my place. Suddenly he says, "Mom, I have to kill you." Can you believe that? You give too much importance to one sentence. A 7 year old says a lot of things, you shouldn't take him seriously. You didn't hear how he said it to me, the tone he used. What should I say? You send me away without giving me a coffee. - Bye. - Are you coming back tonight? - If I don't run away... - Idiot! - Bye. - Bye. Marco, what were you doing in the basement? That door was locked, how did you get in? No, mom, it was open. Marco, is that you? Marco! What are you doing here? What are you doing? Mom! Mom! What's wrong? Do you feel sick? - I'm cold. - You're cold. What's wrong with you? Marco, answer me! Take me away. - Take me away! - Yes. Let's go right up. Marco, what's the matter, love? Oh my God! What are you feeling? Come on! Oh my God! You have a fever! The thermometer! Where is it? What do you say? Marco, what's wrong? Marco, look at me. Marco, I'm here. Look at me. Oh my God! Oh God! - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - I'll go out and play! Run, gallop, horse! Run! Run! You are dead! You have to go down! That doesn't count, you have to fall! Come on! Fall! Fall! Marco, stop it! Come here! Marco! Damn this house and you who didn't want to sell it! I know, seen from the outside they look like nonsense. No, but some things seem more serious when one is tense and nervous. It makes sense that I'm nervous, with what's going on here! Maybe a little bit too much. I see what you're getting at, you know? - I don't want to get at anything. - Yes, you do! Go ahead, say it! "You're a little frazzled, dear. Go see the doctor." "Why don't you go back to the clinic for a while?" Say you don't think that! This is nonsense. According to you, you are a nutcase to me? Where do you get these ideas? You had some nervous disorders, but there was a reason. You are now healed, don't fixate on absurd ideas. - Does it hurt? - Yes. That'll teach me to watch where I put my feet. - Where is the picture? - Which one? The one that was here. I know that you are not sleeping. You don't fool me, you know? Hi. What are these stories that mom tells me? Why are you hiding? - It's a secret, I can't tell you. - Really? - I'll tell you someday, I promise. - Well, if it's a secret... - Don't make your mother mad. - It's not my fault if she gets mad. What about all the stupid pranks you play? You have changed since we came here. I just play. Did you take the photograph in the living room? - Answer. - What photograph? Never mind. Now go to sleep. I'll leave the door open and the light on in the corridor. You can also turn it off and close the door. - Weren't you afraid of the dark? - Not anymore. - Good. Then go to sleep. Good night. - Good night. He says you've changed. What a liar! Do you agree with him? Who do you think took the photo and how did he get in the basement? You have to be patient with him. He is in a new environment, maybe he feels a little lost. Yes, that may be the case. Explain to me the shredded panties what justification they have. It's just absurd spite. You don't want to accuse your son of sexual issues. They got ruined in the washing machine and you didn't notice. It must be as you say. Stay calm. Now try to get some sleep. I'm going to finish my flight report. Bruno, let's get out of this house. Please. - What is it? - Bruno! My God! What a scare! - What happened to you? - I had a terrible nightmare. Look, you ripped your shirt. - Bye. - Bye. - What's up? - I forgot something. - Bye. - Bye. - Will you come back tonight? - As punctual as a plane! Dora, don't do that! It was just an accident. The shutter cord broke. Luckily it didn't hit you. - Let's go away! - Calm down, dear. - Calm down. - Let's get out of this house! - Calm down. - Bruno, I beg you! - Hi. - Hi, Paolo. How are you? - I am fine. You have a face! - Maybe I was distracted. How's the new house? Some problems, especially for Dora. It's a big house... Didn't your wife live there before? Yeah, maybe that's the trouble. I'm coming! Help! Damn! What happened? I don't understand, the control level were blocked. - Mom! - There you are at last! Where have you been? - What's wrong? - Nothing, just a little cold. - Where have you been? - When? You're all sweaty. Before, when I was calling you. I was running after a dog. Marco, why do you tell lies? Mom, I don't tell lies. Dear... Can I come in? I rang, nobody answered and I went in. - Please say. - I'm the florist's delivery man. Is this Mrs. Levi? I couldn't find your house. - It was open and I came in, sorry. - It doesn't matter. These're for you. - For me? - Yes, madam. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Hello? - Hi, Dora. I'm not coming tonight. - What happened? - The plane is down for a check. - Control? - The usual precautionary measures. - Are you still agitated? - No, I feel better now. - Take care, dear. - Yes, don't worry. - When will you come back? - I don't know. - Give me a call. - I'll let you know. - Yes, please. - Bye, love! Bye. Marco, where are you? Did you write it? What is it? - Don't tell lies, Marco. - I don't tell lies. It was you! It's your handwriting, you can't say no. - Why did you do it? - It wasn't me! I didn't do it, I swear! Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that card! I didn't do it! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! Hello? Dr. Morasi's office. Yes, madam. If you want to make an appointment, just tell me. I can see now. Wednesday at 6. Does that work for you? All right, goodbye. - See if you like this as well. - Now let's see. Sit down. Yes, it's beautiful. You're good. Can I keep them? - Yes, keep them. I can make more. - Thank you. - Let's go, Marco. - Come in, Dora. Let's go play over there. - Will you have her draw too? - Sure! - Hi. - Hi. Sit down, Dora. So... I put your son to a basic test. Watch. I told him to draw any tree. He made it cheerful, full of fruit, everything is proportionate. The trunk is not too large, the branches regular, no twisted roots. All this is indicative of a balanced and mature behavior. He doesn't behave like that at home, believe me. Now see this other one. It's his representation of the family. The line is more hesitant, in bed there is only the mother and the child turns his back on her. At first glance, I can interpret it as a need for more affection. I... As I have told you, I am not a specialist in child psychology, but I have treated you and I know what you've been through. Your continuous state of anxiety and depression to have to live next to an addict. Then his suicide at sea, your admission to the clinic, must have affected your relationship with your son. No, from that period there's nothing left in me. It's as if my mind has erased those events. It's all vague. Only now, in that house, my house, memories are comings back to me, also because of Marco's behavior. It's strange, it's as if my son is the intermediary. Dora, ghosts exist only in our minds. We are the ones who create them to justify our behavior. Try to understand what has upset you and everything will become normal and you will find serenity again. Mom. Mom. Mom! Mom! Marco, where are you? Marco! Mom. - Mom! - Marco, stop it! Stop it! - You’ll make me crazy! - Mom! Mom. Why? Why, mom? It was me! It was me! - Dora! - I hated him and I killed him! Dora, enough! Stop doing this! Stop it. You're saying nonsense. Do you understand that or not? Yours are crazy fantasies. Try to reason. I killed him, I remember now. I hated him and I killed him! - Don't start that again! - It was me. Carlo committed suicide, he jumped in the sea from his boat. He was a loser, even drugs weren't enough for him anymore. It was me. I killed him! Do you understand what you're saying? You're accusing yourself of a crime. You are the victim of it! Now he's trying to drive me crazy to get revenge! This house... is saturated with his presence. I'm sure it is. He pushes Marco, he induces him to obsess me! Bruno, let's get out of this house! Please! Please! Please! Please! - Dora, calm down. - Stop it! I can't take it anymore! Stop, take me away! Enough! I'm going crazy. Take me away! I can't take it anymore! I'm scared, I can feel him! He's in every corner of this cursed house. Stay calm! Please. Help me! Help me, please! Drink. Drink it all, all the way down. I've said it all. The drawing... Look! It's the proof! Do you believe me? Tell me, say something! Please, Bruno! It's just a child's drawing. Enough of these stupid justifications! I want the truth. If I was sure that it was me who killed him, it would be better than staying like this! I can't take it anymore, I'm going crazy! I'm afraid. Do you understand that? I am afraid to be alone, I'm afraid to see, to hear. I'm even afraid of my son! Oh God! - Don't touch me! - Dora... - What's wrong with you? - He... He is there... behind that wall. Don't you understand? It was the only way to get rid of his body. When I arrived here, you were in a pool of blood. You didn't even realize what you had done. The only solution was to hide the body so you wouldn't get blamed. I erased all traces after that. I made everything that could have compromised you disappear. I pushed the boat out to sea to simulate suicide. The shock, the amnesia that you had made it easier. I did it for you, not to lose you, because I loved you and I still love you very much. You love me and you brought me to live here? How could you, if you really love me? We couldn't sell the house, we had to move in. They were going to find his body. We'll take care of his remains and then we'll leave. - Do you think he will allow that? - Stop talking nonsense. You don't believe me, you're convinced I'm a visionary, that I'm a crazy person! - You're just tired. - You let me be alone! - I've always been there for you. He is here, with us, I feel his presence. - I have seen him, he wants revenge. - Carlo is dead! Don't touch him! Leave him alone! Let go of him! Let go of him! - Let go of him! - You are scaring me too. Mom! Enough! Milk or lemon? Dad, what game will we play next?
