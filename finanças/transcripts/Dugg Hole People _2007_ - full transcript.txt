We have selected nerd of the year Nerd of the year You're not dressed. You have to get going. Kalli! No, no, no. You aren't dressed. You'll be late for school. Can't you give me a lift? I have an exam this afternoon, my computer just froze and I lost all my notes. What if I find them for you? If your father gives you one more computer for Christmas I get your old one. No. Please little car, don't die now. A new car is the first thing we buy when I graduate. All the way mom, please. No, I'm late. Here this is for lunch. You ruined our website. Tell us the password. Idiot. What did you call us? The password.. What did you say? The password is.. Aah stop hitting me. Hey Helgi, Kalli is hitting her with a bike lock. No. No, don't hit me, no, no, stop, stop. No, I didn't do anything, It was her, who hit me. He hit a girl? He wouldn't do that. and why would he do a thing like that? First he changed the text and picture. Then he changed the password. What's the new password? Did you do this? But I didn't hit her. The password? Idiot. What? The password is I D I O T. Well, I have no other option than to expel you from school, these last few days before Christmas. Kalli, I have to be in an exam in a half an hour, and all this is just not helping me concentrate. She hit me. OK, you know, this isn't working. Kalli I have exams every day until Christmas. I'm also working nights... and... now we're just going to accept your father's invitation to stay with them in the Vestfjords for Christmas. Dad and the pregnant woman? Far north deep in Sugandafjordur. Yes, he is your father. And he has a right to see you. And Vigdis, is just the best thing that has happened to him in a long time But her daughter is a witch. Please don't be like this. Many think that she's psychic, just like her father. He was a very famous medium who passed away a few years ago. Medium, isn't he all right? Thinks he can talk to dead people. Honey, believe me, this is going to do you a lot of good. Hello, hello. Hi. I thought you might be hungry? Are you sure this isn't fish? Come on, you know I would never bring you fish. It's chicken. Do I have to go? I don't know Vigdis or the girl. Yes, that's exactly the point, you have to get to know them. They are becoming a part of your family. I'm sure you're going to have a real good time in Sugandafjordur. But I have always spent Christmas with you. You'll never be without me. You can always reach me. Welcome, glad you could come. Look who's there? Hi Kalli, what's up? How was your flight, good? You remember Ellen don't you? This package is for you. Isn't there a connection here? No, not everywhere. But I'm sure you'll get a connection when we go up the mountain There's an antenna there. Hey a message from mom. Hi Kalli dear, hi honey, it's mommy. I hope the trip went well. I've already started missing you, my sweet darling. Yes and I am also starting to miss you my sweet darling yes, yes bye, bye, I'll see you. Honey, please try to get along with Ellen. She's not a witch like you think, maybe, just a bit weird. Kids, see, there is Sugandafjordur with all the drift ice floating in. Ever seen drift ice before, have you Kalli? No It comes all the way from Greenland and sometimes it brings polar bears over. Isn't it cool? Well there you can see the house. So now we are almost there. Do you want to drive? That's good. Alright, we're almost at the turn, turn here There you go, good, no no no. He just smells the candy. There there, good boy, yes no no. What are you doing? Are you crazy? You can kill the dog by giving him candy. C'mon c'mon, can't you try to behave But why does he have to stay in my room?. This is your room What's with you? Ellen usually sleeps here, but you can stay here for Christmas. Ellen sometimes thinks she's psychic like her father was and sometimes tries to get through to him. Now try to behave. You can show Kalli the horses. A medium finds bones of 18 people in the Dugghole A boy lead a group of people of a cliff in the 18th century These were bones of people who froze to death. No one knew what happened to them for over one hundred years. Until one of them appeared to my father, ...here in this room. Dad found the bones of them all, ...except the boy who came to him. The bones were then buried in the cemetery in Isafjordur. It is said that the boy that wasn't found led the people of the cliff. The boy, he was a creep. Want to see the horses? I've seen pictures of horses. You eat fish don't you? Maybe mommy dearest would rather have a pizza What's that? Ketchup Blue? Yes, that's Kalli. He always has the latest stuff. Has it started? No. No, it was nothing. It's OK, It has passed. Are you finished? Do you want some more? Tryggur? No Kalli, you guys have to stay here. We don't know how long this is going to take, we probably have to spend the night in Isafjordur. I'll call and let you know how it's going. OK? Tear? I'm allergic to dogs (..heavy snowfall and storm in the Vestfjord...) Your mother must be so happy getting rid of you. Now when she has a new boyfriend. She does not have a new boyfriend. She's having exams. Exams, why do you think she got rid of you? She didn't get rid of me. (...but 18 to 20 meters a sec. and blizzard at the West fjords...) ls someone here? ls someone here? Will I get rid of him? Put the power back on. The power went out. That often happens in this kind of weather. Are you scared? Tryggur, Tryggur, Tryggur. EW, he has puked all over me. Disgusting. Tryggur, what has he done? You're trying to kill him. You're trying to kill Trygg. What? Get out of my room, I never want to see you again. I've thrown all your crap out of my room. You're never coming in there again. Well, one more for the slaughterhouse. Aw, that's awful, she has a broken leg. Let me see. There's no use in letting her suffer all the way to the slaughterhouse. Let's just cut her here. Shuss, come here, come here I think we got all the sheep that survived. I still haven't seen the homebred that was supposed to be here with them. Well it's best to get going. They are waiting for us in the slaughterhouse. No, you don't want to go there. They'll take you to the slaughterhouse. Hello Ellen? Hi mom, how is it going? Congratulations honey, you have a new baby sister, she was born just an half an hour after we arrived to the hospital. Congratulations. Tómas says she's just like Kalli when he was born. Great. Ellen, the phones have been out. There fell a few avalanches in the mountain last night . but the phones have been fixed and the power should come on soon. How is Kalli? I think he's OK. Good, because you have to stay alone a bit longer. They are not going to open the road now, there is a storm coming and they are not going to open the road until it's over. Don't you have everything you need? Sure, we have everything, bye. Ugh, he's more stupid than he looks. Do you hear that? Hi mom Hi Kalli hi, and congratulations honey. Congratulations on what? On your new baby sister. Sister? And that you and Ellen were home alone and it was going well. No, no, I'm on my way home, Won't stay a minute longer under the same roof as this psycho which. She kicked me out of my room. Come on, why do you always think girls are attacking you? I'm on my way home, I just have to call a cab. A cab, Kalli you can't go anywhere. They are predicting a storm and the only safe place is in the house. Kalli, you are in the house, right? No, I just walked a bit to get a connection. Kalli you must go to go inside the.. The mobile phone cannot be reached at the moment please try later Isafjordur Taxi service, how... Ha? A car? There's a car! Hey, hey! I'm here, wait for me, Hey, wait for me! Hey, hey, hey, don't go, don't go! You can't leave me here. Hey stop, don't leave me, no don't go, don't go. Come, let's go to the house. Come, hurry! Tryggur, Tryggur Tryggur Kalli, Kalli Kalli, Kalli! Are you alive? Ellen. What on earth were you thinking leaving the house? There's a house here. Are you a complete idiot? Yes, there's a house. We must bury ourselves into the snow and build a snow house. There, come, I dug a hole, ugh Can't you try to push yourself a little? There's something Sara þöll needs to tell you. It was a girl, congratulations, you had a baby sister last night. Congratulations yourself, then you also had a baby sister last night. I wasn't asking for a new sister or a new dad. Where on earth did you think you were going? I was just going to call a cab and get myself to Isafjordur. A cab, to Isafjordur, why? To buy a pizza? What's with you, can't you lie still? I need to go to the bathroom. Can't you go out and pee? I need to do more than pee. Leave that alone. See No, no, no you'll ruin the snow house you idiot. I'm sure this is a cable from the house. A generator Yes, yes! See, I told you there was a house here. Maybe you don't know, but he was from here, Lárus, the boy who led the people of the cliff. They say he haunts this place and scares people away. See, a proper toilet. I'll stay here. There's no connection here. ls this all we have to eat? Yes, unless we kill the lamb. You're kidding? It's going to be slaughtered anyway. You are not alright. You think you can kill the lamb? Of course, this storm can last for 2 maybe 3 days, either we all starve or we kill the lamb. OK, kill the lamb. No need to do it tonight, I'll do it in the morning, outside, otherwise everything will be covered in blood. All talk and no guts. I guess it's best to feed the dog. You might have to eat him too. Will we all get out of here alive? Getting scared of your own nonsense. Let's get out of here before the witch eats us all. Tryggur, Tryggur don't go Hi Kalli, hi honey, it's mommy, Hi Kalli, hi honey, it's mommy, Mom? Hi Kalli, hi honey, it's mommy, Ellen, stop this I hope the trip went well and I already started missing you, mommy's little boy I'm also starting to miss you my darling I know you're going to have a great time up there. bye bye. I wont stay alone out there, besides, this is the only blanket, there's no blanket out there. Were you asleep already? Yes, and having a very weird dream. Ellen! Tryggur. Ellen. Ellen! Ellen! You killed the lamb you crazy person, I'll.. If the phone is still turned on, we'll know exactly where it is. She's lying, making everybody think I led them off the cliff. You will help me, and tell everyone that I tried to save them. Where is she? Promise to help me and get me to them? If you tell me where she is. Promise? Hey hey Kalli, are you awake you sleepyhead? Get out of bed and boil some water. Hey Kalli, come, come! See what I'm bringing! No, no. See who brings food! Hello, hello, no don't come in here, There's a polar bear here, oh no. Hello there's a polar bear here, ugh no, no, there's a polar bear. What are you doing up there? We'll know exactly where he is in 30 sec. Aren't you going to answer the phone and have us picked up. What's wrong? Behind you. Promise? We lost the signal. We're getting out of here, right now. Aw, you're hurting me. What's with you, are you going to chase the bear? No, there's a ghost in there. Come on. Come inside and help me save the cabin. Hello, don't go in, there's a ghost in there. Are you just going to sit there and wait for the bear to come back? Come in, come. What's wrong with you? The ghost was up there, I think it was the boy who led the people off the cliff. That's impossible, that punk would never dare to show is face near me. It was a real ghost. You probably just panicked because of the polar bear and started hallucinating. No, he put my phone in the glass before the bear came. You must have dreamt this. This is just some bullshit Bullshit? Yes of course, ghosts are just bullshit. I must be having hallucinations. What's with you? Can't you lie still? I need to go to the bathroom. OK, go. I don't want to go alone into the dark. There is no way I'm going to the toilet with you. Here you go. Can you wipe your own ass or do you need help? Already wiped. Am I bullshit? You make promises and then break them as soon as you can. She doesn't believe me. Are you alright? No one gets out of here alive! Pull up your pants man. Every time you open your eyes, I'll be there, traitor. Open them if you dare. You went through me; no one has ever done that. You can't do anything to me since I'm no longer scared of you. There, there, cute ghost. But now, since you're not scared of me any longer, are you not going to help me? I can give you one wish. OK. There's just something you need to get for me, and bring to town. But you have to get the girl to help you because she knows where the bones where found in the Dugghole. I'll show you where to go after that. What are you going to do with that? You'll see. You know Isafjordur is that way, that's just back to the mountains. But you promised. I must be insane. Yes, thank you, yes, The rescue teams have searched all over, can't find a thing. No. I was talking to Thordis. Who's that? She worked a lot with Eirik the late, Vigdis's EX. She's a psychic. Are you alright Tomas, she's a psychic? And what did she say? She said she sensed Kalli's presence last night and that he was with the Dugghole people. He was with the Dugghole people? Didn't they all freeze to death on the mountain? It was there, over by the waterfall, where the bones were found. Yes, yes, I now know where it is, come on. Come, come, here it is. Here it is. What? What is that? Ugh Jesus. Don't go. These were human bones; there really was a ghost. What shall we do? What he asked us to. Have you gone completely mad? No, we must take the bones and get them to the others Are you, the plastic man going to touch the bones? You're going to help me right? As you know, they were 18 together on their way over the mountain from a Christmas gathering in Bolungarvík, when a sudden storm hit, like what happened to me. They got lost on the mountain and were headed straight to the Dugghole, but the ghost, I mean Lárus, who was from here and knew the area really well tried to stop them when he realized that they were headed off the cliff. But the farmer from Sand who thought he knew the way even though he couldn't see anything ignored the boy and led the people off the cliff. Lárus managed to grab the sleeve of the girl that went last and managed to hold on to her even though she was hanging of the cliff but eventually the sleeve tore off and the girl fell into the Dugghole like all the others but Lárus fell backwards and into this cave opening and ended here. That's why they didn't find him with the others. And then everyone thought it was his fault and that's why he's been wandering around and haunting people as a ghost. Give me a moment alone with him. Oh well, OK. Thanks; just get it to the cemetery with the others. Just put it on the grave and leave us be for Christmas, after Christmas you tell everyone. Kalli. Yes, your wish has come true. Kalli. Kalli, come, come quick. Hey, hey, stop stop Tryggur, Tryggur, stop him, oh, come on, get up, hello hello, stop! Yes, you're lucky to find me here. I was just on my way from þingeyri. Did you have a good time at the cabin? Yeah, it was just great. It's so cold, it's so cold, I see, I see them, there are a lot of dead people around them. It's so cold. Where are they? There in the corner, there. Mom? Kalli, Kalli dear, I thought I would never see you again. Dogs are not allowed in here. No can't you see her little braces and glasses, just like me. No the smile, that's from my side. OK, hi, look over here, Smile. Thank you so much, bye. Kalli, I got the last two seats on the plane south that leaves in an half an hour so you don't have to stay here for Christmas. We'll just go home, me and you. If it's OK by you? Yes, sure. Eiríksstaðir is still snowed in so we're just going to have Christmas dinner here in the cafeteria. Can't I stay here? Yes, if that's what you want honey, of course. I'll just go alone then. But I must get going because the plane leaves in an half an hour. María, you're welcome to spend Christmas with us. Yes, thank you. The crew of Sigrun IS... Look, look what's on TV. ...caught an unusual catch, a polar bear and managed to bring him live a shore. The polar bear will be put up in a Zoo in Reykjavík What was most unusual was the bear was swimming away from shore. But usually the polar bears that have been seen are
