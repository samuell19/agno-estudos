Hold on there. S.F.P.D. Okay, go ahead. Okay. Come on, baby. Come on. Here you go. Yes. We're in. This is our last shot, man. Should've tried this six weeks ago... Instead of wastin' all that time with those television appeals. Now we go finer. If they all go away, we're finished. Don't even think about it. Back up. We got one! We got one! Don't make a sound. Thank you. Oh, man. He crushed his cell mate's legs, so they put him into solitary through the end of the year. Wow. He's the real thing. No formal education beyond ninth grade, but has an I.Q. of over 150. I appreciate what you're doing for me, captain. McCabe has escaped twice. Second time he took two guards hostage, buried them alive, used their uniforms and I.D.'S. If he'd done it two years later, they would've put him in the gas chamber. Ah, Jesus. This is a mistake, Frank. I have no choice. McCabe! McCabe! You have a visitor. Get dressed. I have to warn you, not just about the physical danger... Because he's already killed one prisoner and crippled another... Right. But also, McCabe is very sharp. He likes to fuck with you. Frank Conner. You know why I'm here. My son has leukemia. He will die without a bone marrow transplant. He's only nine years old. And somehow, somehow, I've been identified as a compatible donor... For your son. I was told you volunteered. We're through here. Officers! You lied to me, Frank. You were identified by computer match. I broke into the f.B.I. Computer system. I violated all state and federal statutes. Grounds for dismissal from the police force. Am I right? That's right. Give me a shot. What's the problem? No problem, sir. My mistake. I went through all the other registries, and there's nobody. You're our last chance. So what do I get out of it? You get to save my son's life. And why would I care about your son's life? What, am I supposed to find some kind of redemption in the eyes of god? Do you want redemption? Do you think I do? You brought it up. Don't try and get inside my head, Frank. I want you in, I'll send you an invitation. Sorry. I thought you were opening a door. I killed... A lady in a hat, a guy in a store... boom, boom. That was real. That happened. I did it. But I cannot make myself feel bad about it. I cannot imagine a god who would care. I put my faith in the power of my own mind, which is all I own after half a life of incarceration. - I can appreciate that. - Really? Well, then maybe you can appreciate... My amusement at the irony... That now, after all those years of bein' locked up, I'm given the opportunity to kill again. Cop's kid, at that. And all I gotta do is stay right here. - What do you want from me? - You been a good father to the boy? I've tried. You tried. Well, isn't that nice you tried? Yeah, even my daddy could say that. Beat the shit out of me every day, but he tried. I've never hit Matt. I'm sure you didn't. What about the boy's mother? Where's she? She's dead. You're still wearing a ring. You feel responsible in some way for her death? She died in a car accident. Dead wife. Kid with cancer. I'd wonder about myself too. Will you do it? Will you give my son your bone marrow? I'm gonna have to think about that, get back to you. No. - You tell me right now. - Why? Because I haven't told him that his cancer's back. And when he went into remission, he wouldn't even let himself celebrate... 'Cause he knew the odds. And now when I go back there, I'm gonna tell him that his cancer is back... And that he will die if he doesn't get a bone marrow transplant. And I wanna tell him that I found that donor. And I wanna give him hope. To make it easier for you. To make it easier for him... And to save his life. Well, since you have to know right now, Frank, my answer's no. Officers! Well, that's not acceptable. And we'll need more etoposide from the pharmacy. I'll get right back to you. Mr. Conner? Mr. Conner? Hi, doctor. How are you? Good morning. Can we sit in my office for a few moments? I'd like to talk to you about Matt. Why? Well, I'd prefer to do this in private. Tell me right now. I've just learned about Peter McCabe declining to be a donor, and I'm concerned. Matt has blood in his urine, his creatine levels are up... And I'm afraid without a transplant, we have very, very little time. Where is he? I wanna see him. He's resting. Let's just give him a moment. I'm concerned about you too. I've learned one thing in a specialty where you can lose many of your patients. You have to care for the family... Matt is not gonna die. We won't give up hope, but you may want someone to talk to. The hospital has counselors... For what? So I can adjust to my son dying? I don't wanna adjust to my son dying. May I see him now? Absolutely. Why don't you ask Gladys? Can you build a rocket ship out of tongue depressors... Without using glue or any other adhesive? That holds together without any glue? Yeah. Hey, dad, look. He's gonna be an architect. Thank you. How are you doin'? How are you feeling? Not so great. Thanks, dad. Oh, yes! Cool, huh? Yeah! Move over. We saw this in the library. P-47 thunderbolt. See the thunderbolt? What is that? Well, its nickname is little demon, and there's a little demon. I think it's just some sort of crazy monster. The cancer's back, isn't it? Yes. B-24 bomber. This guy's nickname... I think I found a donor... For a bone marrow transplant. Really? Yeah. Is he compatible? He's compatible. But he's thinking it over. You mean, he might not want to? He'll do it. Dad, if he doesn't... What do you mean, "if he doesn't"? What did I just say? Even if he doesn't, or if my body rejects the transplant... 'Cause that happens sometimes, right? Well, I just want you to know, it's okay, dad. You did your best. Excuse me. Mr. Conner, there's a call coming through for you. You can pick it up in here. Hey, Matt. Hi. - Frank Conner. - Hey, Frank, how's it goin'? That sort of depends, doesn't it? Yeah. Hey, look, Frank, I've been thinkin' it over. Why don't you send Matt here so I can meet him? Meet him? What for? Look, if it's too much trouble... Hi, Matt. I'm Peter McCabe. You can call me Pete. Hi. Let's see. You're nine. What is that, Matt? Fourth grade? Yeah. You like school, Matt? I fuckin' hated every minute of it. Mmm. Yes, sir. Not "sir," Matt. You just call me Pete, all right? Uncle Pete. But you're not my uncle. Let's do it. Do what, sir? I'm gonna do the bone marrow transplant for you. Dad! He's gonna do it! Pete said he's gonna do it! - Let me talk to your dad alone for a minute. - Wait for me outside. Thank you. Sure. Now, I'm gonna do this if, and only if, certain things are done for me. - Name it. - You will instruct the warden... To give me back my smokin' privileges, reinstate my access to the prison library, allow me four sugars with my coffee... And get me out of that one-man plastic box... And back into the general population. - I'll do everything I can. - Good, Frank. You do everything you can. What's on your mind, Frank? You could've decided this the last time I was here. Well, I wanted to meet Matt. This way, maybe he'd appreciate me more. Sounds a little bit like redemption. Maybe. In a way. Help a kid, help myself. Who knows? Right, Frank? Who knows? Well, this is great. This is great. I'm just happy things are workin' out for both of us. Right. The warden's never gonna approve all the stuff I want. You're gonna have to go over his head. At least you know that I'm gonna be calling you back again in half an hour. Governor is tied up in a trade show all day. Frank! Frank, listen to me. It's gonna happen, all right? It's gonna happen. Now, what about the ventilation? You think he can get through the ventilation system? Not in the new building. But in the old building, I'm concerned about the steam tunnels. Shall we? Heads up. Let's say hello to him. He's right here. Good. Frank Conner, Nate Oliver. This is Sarah Davis, governor Walker's assistant press secretary. Nice to meet you. And she has some good news for us. What? The transplant's gonna go down. Congratulations, Frank. The chief went to bat for you. Miss Davis spoke to the governor, and the governor spoke to the warden. I'm just glad I could help. I don't know what to say. Thank you. Well, what you can say when the local news interviews you... Is that you'd like to thank governor Walker personally for everything he's done. Right. Of course. Is that a deal? Absolutely, yes. Sign for these. These cigarettes are stale. You tell that cop and his dead kid I ain't gonna stand for no stale cigarettes. Just sign this form. Why'd they put him in prison? Did he kill people? Yes, sweetie, he killed people. He's gonna be inside of me, dad. He's gonna be a part of me. Hey, definitely not. Not him. You get the blood of an old person, it's not gonna turn you into an old person, is it? If we could pick and choose, maybe we'd take somebody else. I know. Come on, now, defense. Get those hands up! Incoming. I know who you are, McCabe. I can't get you no drugs. I don't want any drugs. I hate drugs. But you can get me some narcan. It's an anti-drug. It's a counteractive used for o.D.'S. And I want it in an ampule. Not a vile. An ampule. Who's winning? Well, the program's too damn easy. Get me Kasparov. You know what? Get me deep blue. That oughta do it. - Finish up. Lunch in 20. - Right, sir. This is the prison warden. He'll take it from here. Welcome. This old building was the original hospital, constructed in 1904. 1907. It was turned into a prison ward ten years ago when the new hospital was built. You did your homework. But don't let the age of the old girl fool you. Our security is state of the art. This building has two-foot thick concrete walls, an inch of rolled steel over every entrance. The whole place is computer controlled. After the procedure, we'll move McCabe here to the prison wing, a special cell. McCabe, r-45237. Okay, Matt, this is gonna take about an hour. Maybe we should get started? Make it so. Just relax, Matt. You'll be fine. Hey, partner, you do your thing now, okay? I'm with you. I know, dad. I love this city. Don't you? This procedure will greatly weaken his immune system. Until he gets McCabe's bone marrow, I don't care how good he looks, he's without defenses. He gets an infection, it could kill him in a few hours. Let them have his scent. Here's his paperwork. Right. Frank, we've got live feeds from three stations... And reporters from the print media out front. Not right now. Everybody wants a statement. How's Matt, Frank? Mr. McCabe, I'm Dr. Hawkins. I'll be doing the extraction. Nice to meet you, doctor. I'm sorry I can't get up and greet you properly. Pediatric oncologist. Where'd you go to medical school? Shut the fuck up. U.C.S.F. Ooh! Do your men know where they're supposed to go? My officers are here with you until he's anesthetized. Then Kellen's outside the door in pre-op, trimble in post-op. Donna, let's get a gown on him, get him transferred. No gown, unless you can put it on him without removing the restraints. Okay, let's just get him to the table. You're an attractive woman, doctor. Your confidence especially is... Very appealing. Excuse me. I can't get to his hips with his wrists shackled like that. Can't you work around them? Mr. Cassidy, we take the extraction from the iliac crest, which is at the base of the spine. I insert an I.V. Here. I can't operate on him chained. Okay, unshackle him. What are you going to start him on? Demoral? Demoral. Are you a smoker, doc? Dr. gorsha, let's give him the demoral right away. We'll put him under. Right. Let's clear the room. Where's my dad? He'll be back. How you feelin'? Sleepy. He's breathing normally. Bis is at 84. Eighty-four. Is he out? Another minute. - Is he out? - A moment. It's not dropping. Check the probe. I don't understand. He's not responding to the... Aah! Somebody get a blanket! He's gone down the laundry chute! Where does it go? The fall will kill him! Where does it go? Laundry, basement. Help these people. He's gone down the laundry chute, possibly to the basement. - Let's get people there. - How did he get out of the restraints? I bet the bastard dislocated his thumb. I'll be back. Frank. Come in, Frank. It's me. What's goin' on, man? McCabe is loose and they're evacuating the hospital. Oh, my god. How's Matt? He's got a little blood in his nose. It's not a lot, but I just thought you should know about it. His platelets are low. Where's Hawkins? I don't know. Haven't seen her. All personnel, report to the fourth floor O.R. Shit! Ok. See if you can contact her, and I'll be up there as soon as I can! You're not gonna get very far on that leg. Your concern is noted and appreciated. All personnel, code red. Code red. Code red. - Wilson! - I got the blood trail again. It starts here. Ok, he looks like he's gone into the E.R. go around the back. Go in through the ambulance bay. I'm gonna go in through this door. I think we should both... Do as I say! Now! Move! Get Dr. gorsha down here right away. We need extra help. I'll take this one. The burn unit's swamped. I'll take care of you myself. It's okay. Need another ten of morphine. Now, nurse! Go! Nurse, I'm waiting! I'll be right back. Christine, what is the matter with you? This is an emergency room! You're just standing around. I'll do it... oh! No! You shouldn't let her yell at you like that. You'll lose your self-respect. Now, put that in my pocket. Thatagirl. Hold it right there! Let her go! Let her go right now! Doc, tell Frank what happens when you try to take bone marrow from a dead man. Tell him. Move all your patients out in the hallway! - That's enough. Let her go. - Don't fuck with me or you're dead. - Put the knife down. - I'm not afraid to die, Frank. So I'm not afraid to kill her. You understand that, don't you? Tell him. The moment he dies, his marrow becomes ischemic. Without oxygen, the cells die. It becomes useless to Matt. You will never get outta here, so let her go. I'm countin' to five in my head, Frank. Put your gun on the floor, or your son's doctor will be dead. Come on, Frank. I already started countin'. Okay, I'm puttin' the gun down. Okay, talk to me. Let's make a deal. A deal, Frank? What kinda deal can you give me? Eternal life? Not the possibility of parole? Do me a favor, darlin'. Open up that curtain for me. - Oh! - Wilson. If you even think about pullin' that trigger, I'll cut her fuckin' head right off. Look at me. Stay cool. Settle down. Frank, kick your gun over here. I'm startin' to count in my head again. One. You know I can't do that. There is nobody here on your side except me. - You're on my side, Frank? - If you help me. If you put that knife down, give my son a transplant, I will go to bat for you. I will do everything in my power to make your life tolerable. Freedom for cigarettes. Hey, there's a deal. Three. - You'll never get freedom. - I got freedom right now, Frank. I'm freer right here and now than I was yesterday. Ain't that right? - Five! - Here, let her go! What are you doing? Get out of the room right now! Hey, Wilson! Wilson! You kill him, you kill my son. Wilson to Cassidy. I need backup now. I'm in the E.R. I got the suspect. Do not be a hero. He's got no place to go. - That's right. - I got nowhere to go. - I'm warning you. Let her... - You hear that, Frank? He's warning me. You're warning me. Well, I'm warning you, you dumb fuck. You shoot me, then I shoot her. Wilson! And little Frank goes with us. - Now who's warnin' who? - Wilson, lower your gun. You will not shoot that gun. Okay, go. He won't shoot. You sure about that? I'll make sure. Wilson. Lower your gun. Get outta the way. Lower your gun right now. Don't! Appreciate what you did here for me, Frank. If I need anything else, I'll call ya. Stay with me. You hear me? I need some help here. You gave up your gun. I need some help here. I need some help. It's coming in. Give me some pressure on it. - Get down. - One, two, three. It's okay. We got you. Bring him into the second bay. Check over there. Cover the doors. What happened, Frank? - Talk to me, Derrick. - What happened? Tell me, Derrick! We had him. Conner let him get away. How many people are gonna have to die tonight... So that kid of yours can live? Just get me outta here before I do anything else. I told you to stay out of it. I want Conner locked up till this is over with. No cuffs until you're past the press. Sorry, Frank. Let's go. Matt had blood on his nose. I think his platelets must be low. I'm going to him now. You tell him "don't die." Captain, don't kill him. Please don't kill him. Get him outta here. Wait a second? Where are you taking me? To the civic center. Hey, over here! It's me! Frank Conner! Don't believe the police! They're lying to you! McCabe has escaped! The police can't find him! This gentlemen, officer Walker, is prepared to talk to you, tell you everything you need to know. Conner's gettin' away! Nate, what's that light? It's okay, Matt. It's the enterprise. Yeah? Hawkins. How's he doing? He's bleeding more. Hi, Matthew. Hello? It's me. Frank. How's the bleeding? How is he? He needs platelets to help him control the bleeding. He's fine. Hawkins is here. I heard they arrested you. I escaped. I had to. Help me get back into the hospital. Go down to the basement... No! Nate! Nate! Nate! Nate! Time to go, doc. Now I need you. - Matt needs me here. - I need you more. Nate. Nate? No, Matt. Stay. Stay down. Why'd you have to hit him? They told me what an asshole you were, but now I know for sure. Sometimes you don't have a choice, kid. Look, I just need your doc for a minute. I'll send her right back. No. I want her to stay. It's gonna be okay, Matt. Hold that on your nose. Stay in the tent, and I'll be back in a jiffy. Where's the cyclopropane? It's in the storage cabinet on four. You can take my card. Listen. I like you. I like everything about you. And I haven't been with a woman since you were a virgin. I'm trying to be a gentleman here. So I'm gonna ask you again. Don't give me anymore of that, "uh. Duh. Here, take my card. Don't worry about the lock code" bullshit, or I'm gonna forget my manners. Now, where's the cyclopropane? What d'ya say we go down there and find it together? After you. Wake up, Nate. No, go. Matt! Dad. Matt, don't touch anything. Get inside the tent right now. Right now. Get back inside. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. It was... It was McCabe, man. What? McCabe. He took Dr. Hawkins, dad. What? Dr. Hawkins. He took her. Dad, what's the matter? Nothing. Where'd he take her? Um, he asked her where the propane-something was. Dad? Something went really wrong, didn't it? Yes, it did. I'm not gonna get my operation. Hey. Gimme some hands. Yes, you are. But I need you to get some rest now. I'll be back soon as I can. Look at me. Can I go? Yeah, man. Look at me! Can I go? Frank, go. Lock this door. All right. Put that and two of those in the bag. Then you're gonna take me and show me where the electrical room is. Wait! Officer! Hawkins! Come here. What? He's right upstairs in the storage room. 4132. It's on the right. He's got two tanks of cyclopropane, one tank of liquid nitrogen. What is he doing? He's going down the hall to the electrical room. Wait. I think this is yours. Doctor, please don't call the cops. Frank... Please. Tsk. I've got to go to the pharmacy to get amicar for Matt. Thank you. Police! Hold it right there! This section of the hospital is locked down. You'll have to come with us. Hold it right there! Hands up! On your knees! On your knees right now! What are you gonna do? Shoot me, Frank? On your knees right now. Get on your knees. All right, Frank. Don't shoot me. I'm hit. I'm bleedin', Frank. Step out! Step out! Let me see your hands! All right. Just don't shoot me, Frank. Step out! All right. Both hands! Both hands! No! Check the generator. The emergency lighting is gonna kick in. Don't panic. Nate. Nate! Can you hear me? Nate! Yeah, doc. The electricity, the ventilator, everything's out. Where are you? You've gotta get Matt to a sterile environment. In the infectious disease lab, there's an isolation ward. I don't think anyone's there. It's in the old building. I've seen the plans, but how do I get there? Ok, via the walkway on five. There's a lock. The code is 7595. I'll get the amicar and meet you there. All right. Looks like we're movin', Matt. 7595. 7595. Where's my dad? He's out there somewhere, Matt. Call him on the walkie. Dad? Come in, dad. - Matt. - Tell him we're moving to the old building, okay? Dad, the lights went out here. Did they go out there too? Yeah, they went out here too. It's kinda scary, huh? It's not so bad. No, not so bad. - Dad? - Yeah? If I die... You're not gonna die, Matt. But if I do, do you think I'll see mom? I don't know. I don't know about that. I don't remember her so well anymore. Is that bad? No, that's not bad, son. Things just happen that way sometimes. If I die, are you gonna forget me? Never. Never ever. I'm never gonna forget you either, dad. Matt, I've gotta go. Dad, Nate says to tell you we're moving. To the infectious disease lab. Dad, we're going to the infectious disease lab. In the old building. In the old building on the sixth floor. Across the walkway on the fifth floor. We're going across the walkway on the fifth floor. We'll meet you up there, okay? Dad? I got the suspect on top of the walkway. - I have the suspect. - Take him. Someone shot out our light! Negative results, can't find him on five or six. Return to the jail ward and we'll reassemble... Sulfuric acid. Warden on the gate. Tell him to open up and come out of that booth where I can see him. Open up the Sally ports and come down out of the booth, Bob. Do whatever he says. He's got a hypo of sulfuric acid at my neck. Everybody face down on the floor! Put your fuckin' hands over your head right now! Get the fuck on the floor! Show me where to open the cells. There. He's suffering from imminent renal failure. Look, if he dies because you won't let me across this walkway... There's a killer out there. All right, I understand you're trying to protect me. But realize the risk I'm willing to take. My patients need protection, too! Give me the director right away, please. If you don't get me through to my patient, he will die. And you will be pers... And I might add, publicly responsible. Psst! Frank! What are you doing? Matthew's in there. He needs me. Okay, tell me how. I'll do it. Frank. It's taken me more than eight years of medical training to learn what to do. Do you have that long? Okay, come on. Let's go. You have a problem with heights? This is not a good time to find out. I'm not just finding out. I've always had it. Okay, come on. Give me your hand. Don't touch me. Okay, I'm not touching you. Just... okay, stand up. Look at me. That's it. Nice. I'm coming. Look at me. Chin up. Okay, that's it. Just count. One. Two. Don't go down! Don't go... Password. Password. Firefly. About all I can do with it is run the lights and the cell doors. That's all you can do with it. What are you doing? I'm gonna lock the whole place down. Done. Isn't that dangerous? Lay down. It's all right, man. This is Peter McCabe speaking. I am in charge here. All you bulls walkin' around in the tier, you've got one minute to get yourselves down to the fifth floor dayroom, or I'm gonna start killing all your buddies. Hey, fat boy up on six scratching your ass. You hear me? Let's go. Move it! Hey, shut the fuck up! It's good to be the king. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. One. Two. Three. Look at me. Look at me. Oh, no! Oh. It's okay. Get off the roof. Return to the new building and get off the roof. Try and make another pass. 10-David to air-8. Try and drop him again on the roof. - He's on the roof. - Listen and do not speak. I want a six-seat helicopter with a range of 200 miles, fully fueled, on the roof. If this does not take place within 15 minutes from right now, I will kill hostages at 60-second intervals. There ain't gonna be no more negotiations. Don't anybody think of trying to contact me. Over and out. Get him his chopper. How soon can you get a man to... It's gonna take a couple of minutes. Go, Frank. Now, you see that? Here's a lesson for us all. That man has a goal and he's determined to achieve it, no matter what. I was... I was skeptical at first. But now I really do believe he loves that kid. Sorry, Frank. We're in a lockdown here. McCabe! McCabe, open this door right now! Open this door right now! We've got a walkie. Maybe you can call him on that. McCabe... McCabe, Frank Conner. Talk to me! Frank Conner. Talk to me! Frank, no one is supposed to contact me. Let's go. Undo his cuffs. We're goin' to the roof. You said 15 minutes. Did I? Looks like I changed my mind. Come on. Let's go. Richie to 10-David. I'm there, but he's not. - Can you get a shot? - Not from here. It's in there. McCabe, listen to me. My son needs medical attention right away. Yeah, and I need a Martini and a blow job. Looks like we're both gonna have to wait. Son of a bitch. Let's go! Stand by. Here he comes. Matt is in your building. He's in the infectious disease lab. The doctor is here. Just open the door. You cannot possibly care about that. Cuff yourselves to that pipe. He can see her in 15 minutes if your friends do as I say. You care about your freedom? You want out? I told you before, Frank. Don't try and get inside my head. I'm already in there. I'm already in there, Peter. You're not behaving like a cop, Frank. I'm not a cop anymore. I'm a father. Yeah. Fathers. So what have you got for me, Frank? I can help you. Sure. You'd help me. I like that. Don't presume to know what I'm prepared to do. - Okay, Frank. - What if I've done my homework, just like you did yours? What if I know everything that you know? - Hold on a second, Frank. - Here he comes. Duck. What happened? What was that? Just a rat, Frank. I just shot a rat. Now. What's that you were saying? You did your homework. Very good. What did you learn? Everything that you learned. Lay of the land from top to bottom. Shit. Who else shares this information? Just you and me... For now. And we can keep it that way if you open this door. Right now. Conner's selling us out. But can I trust you, Frank? I don't know. Can you trust me? Did you ever trust anybody? Open the door, partner. Frank, where are you? Listen to me. If you had to, could you do the bone marrow transplant... In the isolation ward? Yes. I have the anesthetic. You go ahead. I'll catch up. Frank! Yeah, I'm here. You appreciate my work, Frank? You're a lifesaver. We're a team now, Frankie. We've been a team since the day I met you. You begin to see that now. I need to see my son. "Thanks for the hospitality and for putting up with a difficult guest." That's it. He's moving. So are we. All units, this is vargas. Cassidy's on his way now. Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! My, my. You girls need an exercise program. Stop right there. Thataboy. Take a break. Son of a bitch. Cassidy! Cassidy, come in! Get off this frequency, Conner. Listen to me. Do not send your men. Shut the fuck up, Frank. Do not send your men! He's given the whole thing away. Do not send your men. There's a canister... I lost you, Conner. Completely. - Cassidy! - Let's go. Now. Cassidy! Okay, come on. Get out of there. Get out of there. Fall back! Fall back! Conner! He's shootin' at us! What are you doin', Frank? I had them all, Frank! All of 'em at once! You're starting to piss me off. Matthew, it's okay. Just lie down. Frank, Matt needs to see you. I'll be right there. What's goin' on down there? What the hell was that? My official resignation. I'll be right there. Conner did this. He's helping McCabe now. He could have killed all of us. You know something? I think he just saved our lives. Huh? Let's go. Suspect is not there. Suspect does not appear to be on the roof. Nate, open the door. It's me. Okay, Nate. I'm here. Nate, open this door. I'm outside. Gimme your gun, Frank. Gimme your gun. Close the door! This is Peter McCabe. Acknowledge. Frank? - Keep the door shut, Nate. - Nate. I cannot be killed. I'm immortal, thanks to my kinship with Matt. Frank here, on the other hand, will be dead in ten seconds... If you do not open this fucking door right now! - Keep this door shut, Nate. - Matthew! Matt, no! Lock the door! Dad! Come out where I can see you, Nate! It's okay. Come on out, Nate. Drop that gun. Drop it right now. Back into the room. Let's go, Frank. Dad. It's okay. Let's go. Let's go. Get over there. I need to give him another injection. - Come on, McCabe. - Hey, Matt. Now! Nice try, doc. Frank, I need your help! The bullet shattered the hip bone. Put some pressure on the wound. - Where's the elevator to the morgue? - Down the hall on the right. Cassidy knows about the tunnels. I told him. - We had a deal, Frank. That was our secret. - I lied. Really? Well then... Hey! I'm gonna need protection. Get that gun away from my son! We can dispense with the transplant issue right here. I pull the trigger and the whole thing goes away. You son of a bitch! You hurt my son, I'm gonna rip your fucking head off! You wanna test my resolve, Frank? My willingness to go the limit? You wanna find out where you stop and I begin? Do you, Frank? Take me instead. You and me. Come on! No more deals, Frank. I wasn't really gonna shoot you. I was just doin' that to make a point. So what are you gonna do to me? I truly don't know. Well, it doesn't matter... 'Cause I'm gonna die anyway. Your old man doesn't think so. 'Cause he can't face it. Frank, grab my gun! On the floor! How are you feelin'? What do you think, Einstein? You don't have to look at this, you know. I want to. Come on. Come on. You know, your old man's right about this cancer deal. You can't just decide... To give up and die. You gotta fight, and you gotta keep on fightin'. What for? So I can be sick all the time? Stay inside, not play with my friends? I mean, if I can't have any fun, what's the point? Conner! Conner, get the fuck outta there! Let us do our job! You wait here. They'll come and get you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the... You know, kid, if I could have done that for you... What the hell'd you do that for? My dad's coming to get you and you got a gun. We do have the same genes. No, we don't! Compatible. Definitely compatible. Matt! Dad! Dad, I'm in here! Dad! Open the door! You okay? Yeah. What? He went through there. Which way? To the left. Go back to the elevator and call out. Dad, he's tired! You can get him! We're gonna need every car we have. The sun's gonna be up in 15 minutes. If we don't find him now, he'll get lost in the rush hour traffic. Over here! Over here! What's the problem? - You know who he is? - Here's his license. Hey, partner, I'm on the job. This man have a car? He had a pickup. Let me have that I.D. I need to use your radio. Hey, that's my car!

Nice little trick. - Well, you're a persistent son of a bitch. - I'm motivated.

He's stable. Guard. What? He needs to rest. What? How's the boy? What? How's that boy, Matthew Conner? I hear he's doing good. His body seems to be accepting the transplant. They're all happy up there. Good. I guess I can go now. You're a tough bastard, McCabe. You'll make it.
