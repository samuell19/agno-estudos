Mohammed Rezwan: ISLANDS ARE GETTING SMALLER. THE RIVERS ARE GETTING BIGGER. Glenn Baker: IN BANGLADESH, ASK ABOUT A PROBLEM, AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO ANSWER, "DON'T WORRY, PIECE O' CAKE." "PANIR MOTO SHOHOJ." "EASY LIKE WATER." Baker: I CAME TO BANGLADESH TO DOCUMENT ITS ADVANCING STRUGGLE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, AND TO SEE HOW ONE LOCAL INNOVATOR AND HIS FLOATING SCHOOLS EPITOMIZED THE COUNTRY'S RESILIENT SPIRIT. WHY DO I CARE ABOUT THIS LITTLE COUNTRY THAT, WELL, MANY CAN'T FIND ON A MAP? I GREW UP IN SOUTH ASIA. IN INDIA, THEN PAKISTAN, WHEN BANGLADESH WAS EAST PAKISTAN. SO I'VE ALWAYS FELT CONNECTED TO THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD. THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO BANGLADESH WAS IN 1971, JUST MONTHS BEFORE ITS BRUTAL WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. WE TOOK A FAMILY VACATION. GROWING UP HERE, I SAW THE HARDEST-WORKING PEOPLE I'VE EVER KNOWN-- AND THE MOST HOPEFUL. POOR AND HARD-PRESSED, SURE. YET PRAGMATIC AND IRREPRESSIBLE. IT HURT ME WHEN THEY WERE CONSTANTLY PORTRAYED IN WESTERN MEDIA AS "VICTIMS." I ALWAYS FELT BANGLADESH GOT A BUM RAP WHEN HENRY KISSINGER DISMISSED IT AS "AN INTERNATIONAL BASKET CASE," AND THAT LABEL STUCK. IT JUST DIDN'T SQUARE WITH THE PLACE I REMEMBERED. I WANTED TO PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE. SO WHEN I HEARD ABOUT MOHAMMED REZWAN, A TECH-SAVVY SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR, TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE OF FLOODING HEAD-ON, I HAD TO GO SEE FOR MYSELF. ON THE EIGHT-HOUR DRIVE TO REZWAN'S PROJECT SITE, THE CAR IS BLOCKED BY AN ELEPHANT. I OFFER IT A 10 TAKA NOTE. Man: GOOD LUCK, GLENN. Baker: THE ELEPHANT WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE ELEPHANT'S BEEN WELL TRAINED TO NOT TAKE HANDOUTS FROM STRANGERS OR THE GOVERNMENT. I'VE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY LESS THAN 24 HOURS AND DON'T REALIZE THE BILL IS WORTH ABOUT 14 CENTS. Man: THAT'S THE WRONG END. Baker: FINALLY A 50 DOES THE TRICK. Rezwan: YEAH, THE SCHOOL HERE IS UNDER WATER. Baker: REZWAN TOLD ME FLOODING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF LIFE HERE. BUT NOW IT'S BECOME MORE UNPREDICTABLE AND MORE EXTREME. Baker: REZWAN GRADUATED FROM THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY. MOST GRADUATES MAKE A COMFORTABLE LIVING DESIGNING MANSIONS FOR THE RICH. IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR THAT REZWAN HAD CHOSEN A VERY DIFFERENT PATH. [HORNS HONKING] HE BROUGHT US TO ONE OF HIS FAVORITE SPOTS IN DHAKA, THE CAPITAL CITY. Rezwan: BUT I REALIZED THAT MY BUILDINGS WILL GO UNDER WATER IN THE FUTURE. [MAN SINGING, DRUMS PLAYING] Baker: AT FIRST, IT WAS A LONELY ENTERPRISE. IT TOOK FOUR YEARS BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO BUILD THE FIRST BOAT SCHOOL. Baker: SEARCHING FOR CHEAP MATERIALS, REZWAN LOOKED TO THE PORT CITY OF CHITTAGONG, WHERE OLD SHIPS GO TO DIE. HE BOUGHT A HANDFUL OF SURPLUS LIFEBOAT HULLS AND BROUGHT THEM HOME. FROM THE WRECKAGE, HE FOUND NEW LIFE FOR OLD LIFEBOATS. THE COMMUNITY WAS SKEPTICAL. BUT AS IT AWAKENED TO THE POTENTIAL, VOLUNTEERS CAME FORWARD. Baker: THE VILLAGES THAT HUG THESE RIVERSIDES ARE COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID. EACH BOAT MAKES TWO OR THREE STOPS TO PICK UP KIDS NEAR THEIR HOMES, THEN DOCKS FOR THE REST OF THE SCHOOL DAY. [CHILDREN TALKING] [CHILDREN REPEATING AFTER TEACHER] Baker: ON TOP OF ACCESSIBILITY, I DISCOVER THE BOAT SCHOOLS OFFER SOMETHING ELSE THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS DON'T-- COMPUTERS AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS. Baker: AFTER EDUCATION, ONE OF THE BIGGEST NEEDS HERE IS BASIC MEDICAL CARE. Baker: THIS IS THE FIRST DOCTOR THIS WOMAN HAS EVER SEEN. Dr. Saleemul Huq: HAVING FLOATING SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS FLOATING CLINICS, MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, AND IT DEMONSTRATES FOR THE WORLD THAT BANGLADESHIS HAVE A CULTURE OF LIVING WITH NATURE, AND BEING ABLE TO ADAPT TO WHATEVER NATURE THROWS AT THEM. Baker: CLIMATE EXPERT SALEEM HUQ IS PASSIONATELY CONCERNED BY HOW GLOBAL WARMING IS HITTING HIS COUNTRY. BEFORE MY TRIP, I CAME ACROSS HIS OPTIMISTIC VIEWS ON BANGLADESH AND KNEW I HAD TO MEET HIM. AFTER TEACHING IN LONDON FOR TEN YEARS, HE'S COME HOME TO CREATE THE FIRST RESEARCH CENTER FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION IN A "LIVING LABORATORY." Huq: BANGLADESH HAS A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FLOODS, CYCLONES, HURRICANES COME TOGETHER QUITE FREQUENTLY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTRY HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN FACING AND HAS A LOT OF COPING CAPACITY. Baker: DR. HUQ TAKES VISITING SCIENTISTS INTO THE FIELD TO SEE HOW THE LAND IS CHANGING, AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING. Huq: WHAT I'M HOPING TO DO IS TO LEVERAGE THE CURRENT VIEW OF BANGLADESH AS THE ICONIC VULNERABLE COUNTRY, TO TRANSFORM THAT INTO THE ICONIC ADAPTIVE COUNTRY. Baker: DR. HUQ'S UPBEAT TAKE ON THE COUNTRY PROMPTED ME TO DIG DEEPER. I LEARNED ABOUT "THE BANGLADESHI FAMILY PLANNING MIRACLE." HOW, SINCE INDEPENDENCE, THE BIRTHRATE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM ALMOST SEVEN CHILDREN PER WOMAN TO JUST OVER TWO TODAY. YET ONE THING YOU CAN'T HELP NOTICE HERE IS PEOPLE-- EVERYWHERE. WITH HALF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES SQUEEZED INTO AN AREA THE SIZE OF WISCONSIN, IT'S THE DENSEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. REZWAN TOLD ME A THIRD OF GIRLS ARE MARRIED BY THE TIME THEY'RE 15, TWO-THIRDS BY AGE 18. EDUCATING GIRLS IS A KEY STEP IN DEVELOPMENT. IT DELAYS MARRIAGE AND LEADS TO MORE USE OF FAMILY PLANNING. IT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES THAT ALLOW WOMEN MORE CHOICES IN LIFE. Girl: TWINKLE, TWINKLE. All: TWINKLE, TWINKLE. Girl: LITTLE STAR. All: LITTLE STAR. Girl: HOW I WONDER... All: HOW I WONDER... Baker: RUMA AND RUPA ARE BEST FRIENDS. GIRLS HERE OFTEN DON'T GET A CHANCE TO GO TO SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS, THEIR MOTHERS WON'T SEND THEM TO A FAR-OFF PUBLIC SCHOOL. AT AGE TEN, THEY'RE JUST IN THE THIRD GRADE. Baker: RUPA HAS FOUR YOUNGER BROTHERS. RACEL IS EIGHT. HE WAS BORN WITH HYDROCEPHALUS, OR WATER ON THE BRAIN. Baker: BECAUSE OF THOSE MEDICAL COSTS, RUPA'S FATHER WORKS AS A DAY LABORER IN A TOWN SEVEN HOURS AWAY. HE GETS HOME JUST ONCE A MONTH. THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT OVER TO INVEST IN RUPA. Children: OUR CLASS... Teacher: STARTS... Children: STARTS... Teacher: AT... Children: AT... Teacher: 1 P.M. Children: 1 P.M. Teacher: LAPTOP. Children: COMPUTER! Girl: KEYBOARD. Children: INTERNET. Baker: WHEN THE FAMILY TOOK RACEL FOR TREATMENT, THE HOSPITAL WAS NEAR THE AIRPORT. RUPA BEGAN TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES. Baker: REZWAN CALLED HIS PROJECT "SHIDHULAI," OR "SELF-RELIANCE." THREE YEARS AFTER HE LAUNCHED THE FIRST BOAT SCHOOL, HE BEGAN TO GET NOTICED. IN 2005 HE WAS INVITED TO COMPETE AT THE WORLD BANK'S DEVELOPMENT MARKETPLACE. Baker: MORE RECOGNITION FOLLOWED. FIRST, AN ENVIRONMENT AWARD FROM SILICON VALLEY GIANT INTEL. TWO PRIZES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. IT TOOK BOTH AL GORE AND PRINCE CHARLES TO GIVE HIM THE ASHDEN TRUST SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AWARD. WITH THOSE PRIZES IN HAND, HIS PROJECT STARTED TO TAKE OFF. BACK HOME, THE LEADING ENGLISH DAILY RAN A STORY PRAISING HIS WORK. Baker: LIKE A LOT OF POOR, YOUNG COUNTRIES, BANGLADESH HAS ONLY LIMITED EXPERIENCE WITH DEMOCRACY. I FOUND OUT ON TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL'S CORRUPTION INDEX, IT RANKS 120th OUT OF 182 COUNTRIES, TIED WITH KAZAKHSTAN AND IRAN. IT'S A PLACE WHERE FACTS CAN BE ELUSIVE AND NEWS COVERAGE CAN SOMETIMES REFLECT SPECIAL INTERESTS. WHEN HIS PROJECT WON A MAJOR AWARD FROM THE GATES FOUNDATION, IT RAISED HIS PROFILE AGAIN. Baker: SUDDENLY, THE TONE OF SOME ARTICLES CHANGED. ONE CLAIMED INVESTIGATORS COULD NOW ONLY FIND THREE BOATS. THEY MUST NOT HAVE LOOKED VERY HARD. WE SAW MORE THAN 20 ON TWO DIFFERENT RIVERS. Baker: NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX POLITICS OF THE NON-PROFIT WORLD COMES WITH THE JOB. [CHILDREN RECITING LESSONS] BUT I WAS COMING TO REALIZE THAT AT HEART, REZWAN IS A SOCIAL DESIGN VISIONARY, CREATING A BLUEPRINT FOR SHARED SURVIVAL. Baker: TO SERVE THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LEARNING, REZWAN HAS DESIGNED DOUBLE-DECKER BOATS. ON ONE LEVEL, KIDS ATTEND CLASS IN THE ROUND. UP ABOVE... Baker: SPEAKING OF ANIMAL FRIENDS, WE SAW BIG BATS COME OUT AT DUSK. ONCE NIGHT FALLS, IT GETS REALLY DARK HERE. OUTSIDE THE CITIES, FOUR OUT OF FIVE BANGLADESHIS DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY, LEADING, IN MANY WAYS, A PRE-MODERN LIFE. WITHOUT IT, PEOPLE USUALLY STAY HOME AT NIGHT. WE SAW HOW THE TRAINING BOATS, EQUIPPED WITH BATTERY-POWERED PROJECTORS, ARE CHANGING THAT. Baker: AND SO REZWAN'S COME UP WITH ANOTHER FIRST HERE-- FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT. Baker: VILLAGERS PAY A SMALL FEE TO TRADE IN THE LANTERNS FOR ONES WITH A FULL CHARGE. STUDYING BY THE LIGHT OF A SOLAR LAMP, GOLAPY KHATUN IS THE FIRST GIRL IN HER FAMILY WITH A SHOT AT HIGHER EDUCATION. Baker: WITH A TOTAL OF 18 SCHOOL BOATS, REZWAN'S PROJECT CAN ONLY OFFER CLASSES TO ELEMENTARY GRADES. BUT REZWAN TOLD ME HE FOUND SUCH A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AMONG OLDER STUDENTS, HE CAME UP WITH ANOTHER INNOVATION-- FLOATING LIBRARIES. Baker: SHE STILL HAS TO CONVINCE HER FATHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA. Baker: 17-YEAR-OLD HASINUR RAHMAN LIVES ON THE SAME RIVER. Baker: ON THE BOAT RIDE HOME, HASINUR SHOWS THAT, LIKE MANY BANGLADESHIS, HE'S ALL TOO AWARE OF THE HUMAN HAND IN THE CHANGING CLIMATE. Baker: REZWAN TOOK US ON A TOUR TO SHOW US JUST HOW PERVASIVE THE PROBLEMS ARE. Baker: FUELED BY MELTING GLACIERS UPSTREAM IN THE HIMALAYAS, THE JAMUNA RIVER RUNS DOWN THE SPINE OF BANGLADESH. IT DRAGS ALONG TONS OF SILT. AS THE SEDIMENT BUILDS UP, IT MAKES THE RIVER MORE SHALLOW. AND THAT MAKES THE RIVER EXPAND. IN SOME PLACES, IT'S NOW TEN MILES WIDE. Baker: THE GOVERNMENT IS THROWING BAGS OF GRAVEL AGAINST THE CRUMBLING SHORE. Baker: ON REZWAN'S ADVICE, THAT'S WHERE WE HEADED NEXT. WE TOOK THE OVERNIGHT FERRY PAST GHOSTLY BRICK FACTORIES THAT GENERATE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE SPRAWLING MEGACITY OF DHAKA. WHEN WE SET UP OUR CAMERA, WE WERE SURROUNDED BY A HOST OF PEOPLE EAGER TO TALK. Baker: TOFAZZAL HOSSAIN USED TO GROW RICE HERE. BUT THE POWER OF THE MEGHNA RIVER HAS ERODED THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FARMLAND. Baker: REZWAN DIRECTED US TO THE SOUTHERNMOST PART OF THE COUNTRY TO SEE THE FULL EXTENT OF CLIMATE DEVASTATION. THIS IS AN AREA TEETERING ON THE BRINK, WHERE HIS FLOATING SCHOOLS WOULD PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS SERVICE. Baker: RESIDENTS HAVE COVERED LEVEES MADE OF MUD WITH THATCH IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO KEEP THEM FROM WASHING AWAY. Baker: THIS PART ALREADY HAS. IF AN UPDATED MAP OF SOUTHERN BANGLADESH EXISTED, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A GRID, THE LINES ON GRAPH PAPER BEING THE LAND. EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOW UNDERWATER. IT HAS NEVER RECOVERED FROM TWO MASSIVE CYCLONES IN 2007 AND 2009. WE TOOK A BOAT TO AN EMBANKMENT WHERE THE MUD WAS SO SLIPPERY, A LOCAL MAN HELPED KEEP ME FROM FALLING. Baker: THOUSANDS NOW LIVE ON DIRT EMBANKMENTS SURROUNDED BY WATER AND MUD. Baker: ENCROACHING SALTWATER IS KILLING THE TREES, RENDERING A SURREAL LANDSCAPE. Baker: IN THIS AREA, CALLED THE SUNDARBANS, I DISCOVERED HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALTERING LIVES IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. THE NEARBY MANGROVE FOREST IS HOME TO ABOUT 400 ROYAL BENGAL TIGERS, ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES ON EARTH. Huq: THERE IS VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SEA LEVEL RISE AND SALINITY INTRUSION IS CHANGING THE ECOSYSTEM. THE TIGER'S HABITAT IS SHRINKING, AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOW LOOKING AT ENCROACHING INTO HUMAN HABITATS. Baker: LIKE EVERYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY, THE SURROUNDING AREA IS DENSELY POPULATED. HERE I SAW BOTH VALIANT EFFORTS TO ADAPT AND THE LIMITS OF ADAPTATION. Baker: NOW THE WATERS ARE OVERFISHED, FORCING FISHERMEN TO VENTURE DEEPER INTO THE MANGROVE SWAMP, WHERE THE TIGERS' TURF IS GOING UNDERWATER, TOO. SOME TIGERS CROSS THE RIVER TO LOOK FOR FOOD. INEVITABLY, THEY ENCOUNTER PEOPLE. IN THIS AREA, TIGERS NOW KILL ABOUT 80 PEOPLE A YEAR. A LOT MORE ARE INJURED IN ATTACKS. Baker: RASHIDA'S OLDEST SON, RASINUR, WAS IN FOURTH GRADE THEN. NOW HE HAS TO FILL HIS FATHER'S SHOES--AND HIS NET. Baker: I START TO WONDER WHETHER MUD, BAMBOO, EVEN FLOATING SCHOOLS, ARE GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS VULNERABLE COUNTRY TOGETHER. Baker: DHAKA. THIS IS WHERE THEY COME. LIKE A MAGNET IN THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY, IT PULLS IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. THE LOCAL PAPER AFFECTIONATELY CALLS IT "A CHOKING HELL." WE SPEND HOURS LOCKED IN TRAFFIC. WHEN THE CAR STOPS, VISITORS ARRIVE. THIS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF THE OLD BANGLADESH. THIS HASN'T CHANGED. I CATCH MYSELF WONDERING IF THINGS REALLY ARE GETTING BETTER HERE. Atiq Rahman: IT IS A CLIMATIC DESTABILIZATION OF CATASTROPHIC AND IRREVERSIBLE NATURE. Baker: IN DHAKA, I TRACK DOWN DR. ATIQ RAHMAN, WHO WAS A KEY MEMBER OF THE U.N. CLIMATE PANEL THAT SHARED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. Rahman: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLES WHOSE LIVELIHOOD, WHOSE HABITATION, WHOSE IDENTITY, WHOSE EXISTENCE IN THEIR OWN ECOSYSTEM WILL BE SEVERELY CHALLENGED. Baker: TOGETHER WITH HIS COLLEAGUE SALEEM HUQ, THEY'VE BECOME SORT OF A GOOD COP/BAD COP TEAM FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE JUSTICE. Rahman: IT'S AN ISSUE OF CONSUMPTION WITHOUT RESPECT FOR THE LIMITS OF NATURE. Baker: SO MANY HAVE BEEN WASHED OFF THE SOUTHERN ISLAND OF BHOLA AND COME HERE, THEY'VE NAMED THIS SLUM BHOLAVILLE, WHERE THEY LIVE ABOVE WATER. Baker: NOW ABOUT HALF A MILLION PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO DHAKA EVERY YEAR. AND THEIR RANKS KEEP SWELLING. Rahman: HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES GERMANY HAVE TO TAKE? HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL THE U.S. HAVE TO TAKE? [PEOPLE CHANTING] Crowd: TAKE ACTION, TAKE ACTION, AND GET SOME SATISFACTION. OOH, IT'S HOT IN HERE. THERE'S TOO MUCH CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE. CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Baker: WE WENT TO COPENHAGEN TO SEE BANGLADESH'S CLIMATE STORY PLAY OUT ON A GLOBAL STAGE. WHILE DR. HUQ CAME TO HELP CRAFT AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT TO LIMIT CARBON EMISSIONS, DR. RAHMAN LED A BANGLADESHI DELEGATION TRYING TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR ADAPTATION. Rahman: WE HAVE TO ADAPT, AND ADAPT BIG TIME. THERE IS NO QUESTION OF CHOICE. Baker: THE QUESTION BECAME, HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD RICH, POLLUTING COUNTRIES PROVIDE TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES ADAPT? Yvo De Boer: THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SAYING THEY WANT A NEW FINANCIAL MECHANISM... Rahman: IT'S ALL ABOUT "WE HAVE NO MONEY." THAT IS TRUE, NOBODY HAS EXCESS MONEY. BUT WHEN THE RICH SUFFER, WHICH WAS THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE U.S., TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS APPEARED FROM SOMEWHERE. WHEN THE POOR SUFFER, THERE'S NO MONEY APPEARING. THERE IS A SERIOUS ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE ISSUE IN THIS. Man: TIME IS UP. WE NEED A REAL DEAL. Huq: I WENT THERE WITH HIGH HOPES, AND I CAME OUT TOTALLY SHATTERED. WE HAD A GATHERING OF THE WORLD'S LEADERS. THEY COULD HAVE MADE A DECISION IF THEY WANTED. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF "WHAT'S BEST FOR MY COUNTRY?" Rahman: IT WILL NOT BE ONLY BANGLADESH THAT WILL GO UNDERWATER. NEW YORK WILL GO UNDERWATER. LONDON WILL GO UNDERWATER. TOKYO WILL GO UNDERWATER. Huq: CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT ABOUT WHAT ONE COUNTRY GAINS FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE LEADERS OF THIS GENERATION ARE GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. Baker: FLOATING SCHOOLS, CLINICS, CINEMAS, LIBRARIES. THE NEXT STEP IN REZWAN'S PLAN IS TO HELP HIS COMMUNITY SURVIVE WHEN EXTREME FLOODING HITS. Baker: HE'S DEVELOPING A SENSOR TO BE PLACED AT KEY POINTS ALONG THE RIVER THAT WILL SEND SIGNALS TO THE SHELTERS WHEN THE WATER REACHES A CRITICAL LEVEL. THEY IN TURN WILL SEND TEXT WARNINGS TO VILLAGES DOWNSTREAM. Baker: THE WORLD BANK HAS AGAIN INVITED REZWAN TO COMPETE FOR FUNDING. Announcement: WELCOME TO WASHINGTON DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. Woman: OHH, WHO IS THIS? Rezwan: HOW ARE YOU? YOU ARE HERE? Woman: GOOD! YEAH. OH, COOL. YEAH. I HEARD FROM SOME BANGLADESHIS, THEY WANT TO DO, THEY WANT TO DO MAYA NUT IN BANGLADESH. Baker: BEFORE HE CAN SET UP HIS BOOTH, REZWAN RUNS INTO A FELLOW COMPETITOR WHO HE KNOWS FROM OTHER COMPETITIONS. Rezwan: SO YOU ARE HERE FOR THE MAYA NUT? Woman: YEAH! YOU WANT TO SEE? Rezwan: OKAY, LET ME... Woman: WHERE ARE YOU? YOU JUST GOT HERE? Rezwan: YEAH, JUST GOT HERE. LET ME, YOU KNOW... Woman: COOL. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. Baker: BUT QUICKLY THE CONVERSATION GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS. Woman: WE GOT SOME GRANTS. Rezwan: OKAY. Woman: WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF PRIVATE DONATIONS. BUT MAYBE WE'LL ALL WIN TODAY, TOMORROW. ALRIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. Rezwan: OKAY, NICE MEETING YOU. Woman: WE'LL SEE YOU AROUND. Rezwan: OKAY. Woman: HOW MUCH WOULD THIS COST? Baker: AL JAZEERA HAS GOTTEN WIND THAT REZWAN IS IN WASHINGTON, AND INVITES HIM, AND ME, TO APPEAR ON AIR. Riz Khan: TODAY'S SHOW WE ASK, HOW DOES A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE BANGLADESH ADAPT TO THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE? JOINING ME IS A MAN WHO'S NOT ONLY ADAPTING TO THE GROWING THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY BANGLADESHIS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC THINGS WILL REALLY KEEP MOVING WITH THIS PROJECT, YOU CAN REALLY GROW IT ON A HUGE SCALE? Rezwan: YEAH, IT IS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION IN BANGLADESH. IF SOUTHERN PARTS OF BANGLADESH GOES UNDERWATER, THEN PEOPLE HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION-- THEY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE ON WATER. [APPLAUSE] Man: THE NEXT WINNER... PROJECT NUMBER 1641. "SAMOANS TURN TO TRADITIONAL HOUSING AS A SANCTUARY FROM CLIMATE RISK." [APPLAUSE] THE NEXT WINNER, PROJECT NUMBER 4561. [CHEERING] Man: AN AWARD TO CULTIVATE MAYA NUT TREES. Man: AND NOW TO ANNOUNCE THE FINAL WINNER. PROJECT NUMBER 1358, "ADAPTING NATIVE ANDEAN CROPS FOR FOOD SECURITY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE." [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHS] Huq: BANGLADESH OVER ITS EXISTENCE HAS TEETERED ON THE BRINK OF FALLING OFF A CLIFF, BUT NEVER SEEMS TO FALL OFF. SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENT IN THE PEOPLE THAT PROVIDES A RESILIENCE AND A CHARACTER THAT THEY SOMEHOW CAN FACE ADVERSITY. NOT THAT THEY AREN'T AFFECTED BY IT, THEY ARE QUITE BADLY AFFECTED, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE ABLE TO PICK THEMSELVES UP, DUST THEMSELVES OFF, AND CARRY ON. Baker: AFTER THE LONG TRIP HOME, REZWAN GETS BACK TO WORK. HE'S GOT NEW IDEAS AND STAFF EAGER TO BRING THEM TO LIFE. Baker: RUPA AND RUMA ARE IN FOURTH GRADE NOW. GOLAPY'S FATHER HAS DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE A POLICE OFFICER IN THE FAMILY. HASINUR IS PLANNING A COMPUTING EMPIRE, AND MAY JUST TURN INTO "REZWAN 2.0." Baker: AS I'M LEAVING, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT BANGLADESH POSSESSES EXACTLY THE TOUGHNESS AND RESILIENCE REQUIRED FOR THE PLANET TO SURVIVE THE CHANGES AHEAD. SLAMMED BY THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD'S CARBON POLLUTION, BATTERED BY WEATHER EXTREMES, YET HERE IT IS, A CAULDRON OF IDEAS AND ENERGY. EVEN THE TONE OF MEDIA STORIES IS STARTING TO CHANGE. FARMERS ARE GROWING NEW STRAINS OF SALT-RESISTANT RICE. ONE POSED THE QUESTION, "BANGLADESH--ECO SYMBOL?" THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO WRITE, "BANGLADESH, 'BASKET CASE' NO MORE." Huq: BANGLADESH IS VERY MUCH AT THE FOREFRONT OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS. SO EVEN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.S. CAN COME TO BANGLADESH TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH DISASTERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. Baker: THE ANSWERS TO THIS CENTURY'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS MAY WELL COME FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH. AND AS FOR REZWAN? THE RENOWNED SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION RECENTLY FEATURED HIS BOAT SCHOOLS IN AN EXHIBIT ON SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. AS THE NEW YORK TIMES PUT IT, "RESCUED BY DESIGN." ON HIS PROJECT BOATS, HOPE CONTINUES TO FLOAT.
