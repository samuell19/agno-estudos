Good morning, I’m Peter Sommers Top story today is 32 year old Swiss banker, Tobias Bachman Is still missing after allegedly killing 6 people Yep, all in, I just feel like my entire life is either in cardboard boxes or bin bags No, no, you have got to see this house, it is gorgeous Just hope my mums right about the rent because this place is way nicer then the last Mr Bachman from the Chateau D'Oex, in Switzerland, has been missing since Thursday Oh talk of the devil, she’s just pulled up with Emily Yeah I’m going to have to catch you later Becca, yeah you too, all right, see you later Police have no clue to his whereabouts, our man Matt is on the scene So is it okay then sweetheart? The house? Oh it’s lovely I knew you’d like it Like it, I love it Oh I’m so pleased Thanks mum Did you manage to break anything while you were unpacking No, there's still time Where’s Mungo? I had to pop him outside he was getting underfoot Pop her down for me mum, I’ll go see what he’s up to and then I’ll pop the kettle on Ok I love this house Mungo Mungo What have you got now? I can’t find any mugs What’s that? A box, the dog found it It can’t have been there very long, I wonder what’s in it Looks like a game, but, who’d bury a game Probably kids mucking around, they do strange things like that Ugly looking thing isn’t it? Do you remember when you went through that phase of wanting to do everything With your eyes closed Oh yeah, I used to get dressed with my eyes closed And put my clothes on and tie my shoelaces with my eyes closed But I drew the line when it came to mealtimes, do you remember that oxtail soup Can you get that for me mum? Look who’s here Oh, hi Laurie. Was just about to make a cuppa… do you want one? Not for me, thanks. I’m not stopping… just popped in to see how the move went Great. No problems… look I just wanted to thank you, you helped me out of a real hole And it was a hole, too! That flat was disgusting… all that damp Well, that’s in the past now. I just hope you’ll be happy here I’m sure we will be. At least I know you’re not a slum landlord Well, if you have any problems you just let me know Thanks Laurie, I’ll bear than in mind What are the local kids like, Laurie? What the kids? They’re fine. Not much trouble I wish they wouldn’t play football in the street though. They’ll break a window one of these days Why do you ask? No reason… But we just found something buried in the garden What did you find? This It’s a game of some sort Yeah, I think it’s called a spirit board What’s a spirit board? It’s just Tommy-rot. They’re used to contact the spirits of the dead. It’s just a load of rubbish Sounds harmless enough. You don’t believe in that, do you? No, I told you. It’s a load of tripe But how did it end up being buried in the garden? Like you said, probably kids mucking about. I’ll tan their arses if I see them Only got UHT milk I’m afraid. Are you sure you don’t wanna stay for a cuppa, Laurie? No thanks, love. I’ll be off now I’ll be seeing you, India. And you remember where I am if you need me Alright I’ll see you later Laurie Bye Such a lovely man Yes… I wonder why it bothered him so much though Dunno, mum… Here How did the family first meet Laurie in the first place? We’ve known him for years… like he says, he’s always here for us So was he an old friend of grandad’s then? I expect so Do you know, now you’ve asked me I honestly can’t remember the first time I met Laurie Must be my age, I’m cracking up Okay, let’s see if we can’t get organised? Where do you want to start? Hi Becca Yeah, I was No I should have been up by now anyway Yeah I'm sure we can make that Sids Cafe 11 a.m. Uh-huh, we’ll be there Ok... bye I must be losing it Why would I have brought this to bed with me Hiya Hi Ok? Yes, I suppose so Look at what auntie Becca’s got Just look at the mess she’ll make of that Hi girls, what can I get for you? Can I get a cuppa tea please? Do you want a brew Two teas please, thanks So are you all settled in then? No, not yet I’m not even unpacked Oh. I am sorry I couldn’t help with the move. There's no way I could have got the time off work I was on a fag break when you called me Oh, I phoned your friend Terry. He wants to see me about the job Terry? He’s my dad’s friend. I think he’s a bit of a letch Oh, great! So I’m going to be working for a pervy old man Calm down... he’s okay I just think he’s a bit seedy. I mean he’s got to be nearly fifty Oh yeah I remember. You think anyone over the age of thirty is over the hill Well, you’re more or less past it by then Does Nathan know your views… because he’s twenty-five And you’re getting married next year so you could get a good 4 or 5 years out of him before you put him out to pasture I’ll scare him into staying young Anyway, when’re you going to see Terry? He wants to see me tomorrow afternoon Does he know you’re a single parent? No Do you think that’ll matter? Dunno Thanks So who’s gonna look after Emily when your at work? Mum’s volunteered. It’s only a part-time job so it won’t be every day What about Paul? Well, he’s not helped so far, so I don’t expect any help now Doesn’t he pay anything towards her upkeep? He hasn’t got anything. He’s either pissed or stoned or most of the time both So we still on for tonight then? Bottle of wine and a chick flick? If I can find the bottle opener And this time I choose the film Don’t worry about the bottle opener. I’ll bring a spare just in case Whoops Can I help you? Erm... is Terry around? I'm Terry India Harper… we spoke on the phone about a job Delighted And who's this? Oh, this is my daughter, Emily Hello Emily So who’d look after Emily if you came to work here, India? My mum can fit around any hours you might want me to work Have you worked in a retail environment before? What are you like handling money? I used to work at Tesco Tesco... right Have you ever worked with animals before? Well, sort of Sort of? Well I used to work at the fishmonger counter at Tesco Well, you’ll find the stock a little more livelier here, but still slippery customers though So what are you like handling rodents? Fine… No problem What about reptiles? Again, no problem Well, what would you be like feeding rodents to reptiles? Well they have to be fed you know I don't know Well it’s a good job I don’t keep exotic pets here… we’re strictly a traditional pet pantry Well, you come recommended by Rebecca She's got a bit of an imagination on her mind But she is a good girl Her dad speaks highly of you So do you want the job? Yeah of course Is that it? Well the animals seem to like you, I’ll see you on Monday Yeah, cool Great Bye So then he was like, well the animals seem to like you and that was it Well, things are looking up, aren’t they? New house, new job We just need to sort you out with a new fella Mungo’s the only man for me thank you Well here’s to a bright future Cheers What’s the matter with Mungo? He’s usually my best mate when I visit I don't know He’s been off since we moved in When I came in this afternoon from seeing Terry, he was just frantic He’s probably just pleased to see you. You know, alone in a new house Maybe Just when we moved in he was fine and then What? Well, he found that box and he was desperate to get it out of the ground Once I got it out, it was like he was Terrified of it What box? Oh, some sort of board game. Laurie said it’s a spirit board But I think it’s just some of the local kids messing around What’s it for? Apparently it’s for contacting the spirits of the dead Actually I left it upstairs, I’ll go and fetch it for you Ok that's weird I swear I’d left it upstairs Are you sure this is supposed to be safe? I mean you hear about stuff like this You’re worse than Laurie. Of course it’s safe. It’s a board game like Snakes ‘n’ ladders or ludo Yeah but… what are you supposed to do? I think we use this thing And we each put a finger on it and ask it a question Go on then, ask a question How many children will Rebecca and Nathan have? You pushed it Moi? I think it’s more wishful thinking on your part Ok Let’s try again and I promise I won’t cheat this time Ok How many children will Rebecca and Nathan have? I must not of closed the front door properly Do you want another drink, settle your nerves? No thanks Fancy another go? No thank you, I think I’ll take the hint Are you ok? Yeah, I’m just a bit cold Do you want to borrow a jumper? Could I? I’ll get you one No no no, I’ll get it I need the loo anyway What’s the matter, boy? You just haven’t been yourself, have you? Well? They’ve operated. She’s still unconscious Did they say... ...Is she going to be alright? They said it’s too soon to tell It’s a really bad fracture And who's with her now? Her mum and dad and Nathan, he just dropped me off I feel dreadful. Something like this happening in one of my houses It’s my fault. I put the stupid baby gate up It was an accident, sweetheart. She couldn’t see where she was going A million-to-one accident... the policeman said that Put the kettle on, shall I? If you need anymore help just give me a shout okay? Thank you Are you going to see Rebecca tonight? Yeah… visiting time is 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. Any change? Not really She’s still in the coma… three weeks now and no change I’ve hardly spoken to Michael since the accident. I don’t like to bother him really Would you tell him that I’m thinking about them all? Of course I will… how do you know him anyway? We’ve known each other over thirty years. We went into apprenticeships together Would you believe I went into engineering at first I didn’t like it, Michael stuck with, I wasn’t that interested myself He went on and carried on doing it, but my passion has always been with animals Anyway, we ended-up being made redundant and I opened this place up Michael went into business for himself Then he met Elaine And they had Rebecca Happy families Didn’t you ever fancy having a family yourself? It was never in my blood really. I was an orphan I never knew my dad and my mum died when I was four And I was raised by my Auntie Elsie That’s so sad But hey, look, we're a bit quiet today, why don’t you get yourself off a little bit earlier Go get yourself something to eat and you can spend more time with Rebecca Thanks Terry Emily? Emily? Emily? Emily? Emily Emily.... Emily... Emily Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, Amen Stupid question really but how’re you doing? Coping... just about Well, I’ll go and say cheerio to Michael and be on my way Hi Thanks for coming Will I see you at the wake later No… since the accident I cant bare to be away from Emily Understood How is she holding up? She’s fine… it was more the shock than anything… frightened me to death Well Glad she’s on the mend Well, I’d better... you know Poor, poor lad He was always so confident she’d make it and now Come on, sweetheart. Let’s get you home I’ll just go and say goodbye to Michael I’ll meet you back at the car Thanks for driving us Laurie Everything okay? Yes, just letting my imagination run away with me a little bit What do you mean by that, imagination It's nothing… just an old man’s fancies. Jumping at shadows No… go on I know it’s all nonsense really but... ...There are one or two things I didn't tell you about that house when India moved in Like what? Do you know Shakespeare? Shakespeare? Hamlet… There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy What? What’s that supposed to mean? Sometimes there’s more than meets the eye I don’t know what you’re trying to suggest, Laurie, but you just keep it to yourself My daughter’s just had to say goodbye to her best friend. She’s heartbroken India has enough to deal with right now Without you frightening her and your scaremongering I’m sorry... I won’t say a word, I promise Oh, I’m sorry... it’s just the strain of these last two weeks, is just bubbling to the surface You’ve been marvellous. With India and Emily and helping them out We just need to think more positively. We need to put this dreadful time behind us Owwww Please can I have my ball back? I’ll put a bloody carving knife through it Neesha? Up here Is everything okay? Something awful’s happened It’s okay, Emily’s fine, she’s fine, it’s your dog What about him? Where is he? That’s just it… I don’t know. The front door bell rang, I answered the door He ran through my legs and he was gone But before then he’s was under the television, he wouldn’t come forward, then suddenly Who was at the door? That’s the peculiar thing… there was no-one at the door. No sign of anyone Well, I suppose he wouldn’t have gotten far I feel awful, I’m so sorry Don’t worry about it Neesha, It’s not your fault Honestly he’s been acting up the last couple of weeks I’m sure he’s just gone to the park And we’ll go down there and we’ll find him Hiya mum… No, no sign of him yet Nothing. Just listening to some music Yeah I suppose he’ll turn up when he’s hungry Yeah, you too... Bye Bloody kids And you say you’ve never had trouble from this cheeky boy before Who hangs around the back He’s a nuisance with the football. Cheeky with it though He nearly hit me with it yesterday, he was very rude too But he’s never caused any damage to the property or anything like that? Not deliberately, no And you’ve never witnessed him doing any acts of cruelty to animals? No Well there's not a lot to go on But just because he’s made a nuisance of himself with the football Doesn’t mean to say that he’s going to do anything worse But this is a serious matter and it’ll need to be looked into If somebody is hurting animals they need to be stopped. I’ll make some enquiries I’ll see you out Why are all these things happening mum? Oh Shhh I’ll make some tea, shall I? Do you want tea? I want to know what’s going on Going on? Don’t mess about, Laurie. You know. What you told me at the funeral I shouldn’t have brought that up But you did bring it up. Why? It’s nothing Laurie, if you think there’s anything at all ‘wrong’ with this place And India and Emily are in danger, you need to tell me and tell me now I’m not sure there’s anything I can tell you What do you mean by that? At the funeral you said More than meets the eye What did you mean? Laurie. Do you think there’s something wrong with this house? Yes or no? No Then what’s it all about? Karen If I thought there was anything wrong with this house I would tell you Ok But what I said before still stands. Not a word to India I’ll finish making the tea Oh, and Laurie... there’s a packet of chocolate digestives in the end cupboard Hello? Hello? Oh... Hey I have this... ...Board in a box. I wanted to sell it I was wondering if I can get anything for it Don't worry, it does that all the time… Now what have you got here? I found it buried in my garden An interesting place to find anything Well I must say it's in nice condition considering Do you think I could get much for it then? Eastern European Early 19th Century They transported the wood from the Black Forest in Germany So it is worth something then? No, not really There's no demand for them any more... witchboards Mumbo jumbo stuff… Best not play with it though Just in case What have you got here? What the hell are you doing here, Paul? How did you find me? Look, I know it’s not cool to just turn up, but I couldn’t call you. I don’t have your number Yeah, there’s a reason for that now piss off Don’t say that. I just want to talk… Honest Just leave me alone I’ve got money Money for you and Emily Fine let's go for a coffee Where did you get it? Working You mean dealing? No, it’s all pukka You haven’t told me how you found me It was accidental… I saw you coming out of that pet shop on Pemberton Road And followed you When? It was last week So why didn’t you just speak to me? I know it’s a bit weird but I knew you’d just shine me off if I came up to you in the street So you decided to wait a week, and then tell me you’ve been stalking me I was waiting until payday... I couldn’t just turn up empty-handed you know See So what’s this job then? It’s nothing much, but I’ve got a job at the car plant. Do a lot of nights So why haven’t you been in touch before? Where were you when Emily needed new things I know I’ve been a bit of a slacker A bit? You haven’t had a job in the five years I’ve known you And you’re always pissed or stoned and you don’t give a fuck about your own daughter I know I know. Look Inds, I know I’ve not been much of a dad to Emily but I want to make up for it Where is Emily? She’s with my mum. She’s giving me a day off So where are you living now? Back at mum and dad’s, as soon as I’ve got enough money I’ll get a flat So why this sudden change of heart? You haven’t cared much up ‘til now I heard about Rebecca I didn’t like her much but it was a fucking horrible thing to happen And it got me thinking a bit Life’s too short, ain’t it? So I... ...Got out her baby picture and it made me feel all funny. Like I should be doing more Anyway, I asked mum and dad if I could move back in I applied for a load of jobs, got the one at the car plant. I’ve been there three months That’s got to be a record. You doing anything other than a week Can I get you a drink? Coffee would be good. Four sugars please I see some things don’t change eh? I'll have a cup of tea please Watch my things Paul, I need the loo So what do you want to do? Paul What the fuck Paul That was boiling Jesus Paul? He’d been dead for about twelve hours when they found him In the river? But that’s miles away from the cafe. How could he have run all that way? I think, knowing what we know of Mr. Simms, he might have taken drugs We’ll know more for definite when we get the results of the post-mortem If he was under the influence of LSD He’d have run that three miles without even taking a breath What are you doing up, sweetheart? Couldn’t sleep… Kept seeing It’s ok We’ll see ourselves out Try not to worry about this, India If we have anymore questions we’ll be in touch, but I don’t think there’s much more to add Thank you Do you feel like a little something to eat? No. I’m not hungry. I feel a bit sick Hardly surprising. What the hell was he playing at? I mean... I don’t know why you even went for coffee with him You knew what he was like. People like him never change I told you. It wasn’t like that He was fine when I went to the toilet Well he must have taken something while you were in there Mum you’re not listening, something happened to him Well drugs do funny things to people I know what drugs can do. I was there, remember. It wasn’t the drugs That’ll be Laurie How is she? Still shocked. Can you blame her? Is Emily still with Neesha? Yes, and I should think about collecting her. Neesha’s had her all day Oh, Laurie. I don’t know what to say. I’m so sorry about this Don’t worry about it. If anything, I should be apologising to you and India Why? None of this is your fault No, but I still feel so responsible And remember, not a word about any silly theories Sorry Oh no love, the important thing is that you're okay I don’t want to go back... Not yet mum It’s okay. It’s okay. You don’t have to do anything until you’re ready You can stay here for as long as you like You don’t mind do you Laurie? None of my business, love. You do whatever you think’s best. You just take your time Right, I’ll be off. I just called round to see you’re alright Penny for them, sweetheart Do you believe in curses, mum? What do you mean... Why’re you asking me that? With everything thats happened, Rebecca’s accident Emily falling in the bath, Mungo and now Paul Of course I don’t believe in curses and neither should you. Bloody rubbish. It’s just bad luck But everything’s gone wrong since I moved into that house. Nothing’s gone right Well, what about your job? That was good luck, wasn’t it? You’ve not mentioned this to anyone else, have you? No. Like who? Like Laurie for instance No, why would I mention it to Laurie Nothing Shall I go and collect Emily... Neesha will think we’ve abandoned her Hello, Mark. I was going to report you as missing Yeah, sorry… business is booming, booming I’ve been taking a new round since they built those new houses over on Baker Way No time for your regulars now then? I've always got time for the old favourites Not so much of the old. Glad someone’s having some luck Did you hear about what happened here? Girl who lives here. Her friend fell down the stairs That was here? I heard about that Yeah. Anyway, can you do this as well as mine? Just knock on the door when you’re done Can I get in round the back? Yes, it should be open Oh and Mark... ...Just mind out. Be careful I’ve done this before a few times before I think I’ll be alright Yeah, I don’t want any more accidents Are you sure about this? Yes mum… We can’t stay here indefinitely, can we? Actually, you can and I wish you would Mum, I’m too old for that. You know I like my independence But after everything that’s happened? Yeah but you were right It’s just a case bad luck. The only way to do it is to get in front go it, it can’t last forever Can it? Well you will call if anything’s worrying you Don’t I always Oh hello Laurie Hi Karen… I wasn’t expecting you today Yeah well India insisted on coming back... I can't think why, but... Oh hi She's down Look will someone please tell me what’s happening? Please Laurie’s got a theory about... about what’s been happening Well? Come on, Laurie. If my daughter’s in any kind of danger I need to know about it It’s like I told your mum. It’s as if this house has got bad luck associated with it Well, you could say that No, I mean looking back, it’s as if it’s always had bad luck associated with it Please just tell me everything Well, it’s sound ridiculous to say it but I think the place is haunted Haunted… You mean ghosts? Well... Yes Mum Laurie said there seems to have been a lot of misfortune here over the years And you let Emily and me carry on living here when you knew that? I didn’t believe it… Would you? I don’t know what to believe After everything that have happened I really don’t know what to believe anymore See today clinched it for me There was no way that, that hose would’ve got wrapped around the door handle No way And you really believe a ghost did that... do you know how mad that sounds? But look what’s happened, look what happened since you moved in here If just one of those things would have happened you could’ve maybe called it bad luck Two, coincidence What about the rest? Your friend tripping The toilet door sticking I had that lock to pieces myself and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Nothing at all Your boyfriend So what do we do? I don’t know Look I don’t believe in ghosts... but I do believe that this place... has bad luck You can stop with me for as long as you like, you know that I think we need to keep our heads Well perhaps we need to seek some professional help for this Professional? I’ll phone Father West and ask him to pop round Father West? Why? Is that really necessary? It’ll put everyone’s mind at rest... Right now these two are coming with me Go and get Emily... Can you help me with the bags, put them in the car? I’m not going to be forced out, mum We’ll come with you tonight... But I’m going to get to the bottom of all this Hello? Hello Misses Harper? Misses Harper? Sorry if I’m a bit early. I was due to call on Mrs. Frobisher But she cancelled on me at the last minute Anyway, that’s about the size of it. He was very shaken-up I’ve sent him on retreat for a couple of weeks. Recharge his batteries. He’ll be okay after a rest And you believe all that? Everything he told you? Mrs. Harper, I think you’d probably be surprised at what we’re called on to believe at times But in this day and age Well extraordinary to think, but it does happen And the age we live in is immaterial. You say there was a spirit board? Yes, but it’s just a toy, isn’t it? Believe me, dabbling with such things is no game And the consequences can be too terrible to contemplate So it was my fault for messing with it? Oh no, I doubt it. If what Mr. Fairbairn’s tells me is true This goes back some time. The spirit board was more likely the trigger than the cause Sometimes incidents of this nature can be attributed to a form of psychosis So you think I’ve made this up... That I'm mad? Oh, no, no, no. That’s not what it means The human brain is a very powerful organ. It’s capable of much more than we might imagine I never really thought there was so much in it Have you ever heard the expression The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist? The Usual Suspects, 1995... But Hollywood stole it from higher sources, as they wont to do You don’t believe it’s the Devil, do you? My faith in the Almighty is unshakable, Mrs. Harper, but for every Yin there is a Yang I don’t follow you You know it’s funny how so many believers have an unshakable Faith in our Lord But have trouble admitting to belief in the powers of darkness However... In order to believe in one, you must believe in the other And you believe this is the work of the Devil? Not necessarily but I do believe that unquiet spirits might be at work in the house That’s unbelievable It’s not as uncommon as you might think... Have you seen the film Poltergeist? The one with the clown and the tree? That’s it… 1982. But did you ever see Poltergeist 2? Oooh you must. 1986. Fascinating stuff Shows how the potent combination of madness and religion can… in theory, of course Prove sufficient to enable passage from the netherworld to our own Much has been made of the scientific study of poltergeists But in my opinion this second movie delves into uncharted realms Insanity as a bridge from the other Side Insanity? Not in any conventional sense, my dear Lunatics on the loose, induced latent psychosis, all that hogwash. No no no What we may be facing is a genuine spirit of evil Somehow, whatever this is has found a portal to the earthly realm The movie depicts a seemingly physical menace But what we’re dealing with may well be incapable of materialisation So instead it has to plant hallucinatory visions in the consciousness Of those it wishes to do harm Merely my theory, of course Though one backed up by research by some of the leading experts in the field That's incredible... So what can we do? I’d like to take a look for myself if I may? Would you like me to come with you? Thank you. I’ll go over tomorrow. This needs looking into as soon as possible Don’t look so worried These may be powerful forces we’re dealing with but we have good on our side We will prevail Ah Mrs Harper Bishop Chapman Laurie Now don’t expect any of those Father Merrin power of Christ antics The reality of these matters is usually somewhat less dramatic Than cinema would have us believe Father Merrin? That’s The Exorcist isn’t it? Two points, my dear. Some in the Church admired it greatly But I saw the real thing once and have to say the film got it all wildly wrong The lounge? Straight through Splendid Oh dear Lord Oh dear dear me, I’m really, terribly sorry, Bishop It’s just like that film you mentioned isn’t it But I came in and hovered while India was out at work I’m awfully sorry, I cant imagine what you must have thought No harm done, let me help you put everything back So, Bishop – do you think it’s all clear? Well I’ve seen nothing to indicate otherwise, this house may well be untainted at present At present? Do you mean there could be other Manifestations? Well, given the extraordinary events you’ve described Plus poor Father West’s troubles I hesitate to give the all-clear. There seems to be little more I can do here today, however Other than demolish another of these delicious iced confections Hodges you’re among friends, were just here to help What the hells happening? I honestly don’t know, Charlie. He just started foaming at the mouth, about ten minutes ago Thanks for answering to the call so quickly I’ll try to close in Charlie... Charlie Officer down Are you sure you want to do this... You said you didn’t believe in it I don’t really... What about you? I’m just here to help... If I can I suppose I’m trying to prove a negative If nothing happens we can call it bullshit and move forward The Bishop’s clearly a believer in evil as well as the forces for good And he seemed to doubt that there was anything to fear here. I just want to be sure Well if you’re sure? Sure I’m sure... Let’s finish this Let’s start with the old favourite shall we? Is there anybody there? Let me try How did the board get here? We’re getting nowhere It’s probably a good job too... You might just be right Let's try again please Becca What really killed Rebecca? Come on girl, that’s a bit much I just… I miss her I know, whatever may or may not happen here, don’t tie that terrible accident into it all It’s like the Bishop said, in a funny way it’s not ghosts or ghouls that influencing us It’s us You know people come up with some funny shit sometimes Odd connections, stuff buzzing through your brain It’s trying to make sense even where there isn’t any Ok Just one more time and we’ll call it a night? Okay then girl, make it a good one Can you tell... What really happened to Father West? You know, this board’s not giving anything up tonight. Perhaps there’s nothing to give Perhaps the Bishop was right... Coincidence... Psycho-suggestion, all in the head What happened to Rebecca Could have happened to me or anyone who went past that baby gate And losing a good friend so young like that You’re bound to want answers... But sometimes that’s not possible Thanks for coming tonight I don’t know who else I’d have asked... Even if we both look a bit silly now Well like you said, at least you might have proved a point Well, sounds as though the winds picking up. I’d better wander back Are you going to be okay? Fine… Fine... I’ll see you soon Goodnight India, love Laurie? Laurie? Becca? Fuck you Shit Fuck Get out of my life Leave me alone Good morning I'm Peter Sommers Top story today is, twenty three year old single mother, India Harper is still missing after allegedly killing three people. Miss Harper, from Dudley in the West Midlands has been missing since Tuesday If you have any information as to her whereabouts please contact your local police station
