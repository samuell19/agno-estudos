panzehir57 (intriguing music) (gasping) (whimpering) - I don't understand why you're doing this. No! No! (muffled screaming) (rhythmic music) - Which means that not only are we in a position to make A bid on the langford group, but we can continue Our global domination. We're all set to proceed with the acquisition, And the marketing pitch is ready to be rolled out. Just waiting on your greenlight. - Thank you, taylor. And great job, everyone. Let's get this deal closed. Give the langfords no reason to go with the greenbergs over us. Fantastic presentation, ms. Hayes. - Thank you. - Your work is never short of impressive. - Thank you, you as well, mr. Covington. - Well, we aim to please here at covington construction, In all areas of service. - I can't wait to marry you. - You mean again? I love that we did our own thing, A secret elopement is very sexy, but I want to tell people And show off my wife. - I know, but you have to wait at least a couple more months, Or you're going to ruin the surprise. Okay? And then we'll get married in front of everybody. - Fine. - And if anyone asks where we were this weekend? - We were location scouting on the coast for the big day. - Exactly. - Woah! Hey, now! This is a place of business. Does hr need to hear about you two again? - You can just admit that you're jealous, rex. - Jealous? Hmm, no. I actually feel bad for taylor, She has no idea what she's getting into with you. - Is that so? - Yes, ma'am, with this fellow right here, You're in for a life of lots of eye contact, And heartfelt conversations. And way too much hair gel. - Your hair looks great, honey. - Thank you. - Here are the annual reports you wanted. - Thank you, rex. - Ready to move forward with the acquisition. It's all good to go. - Thanks. - Let's hope. - Yeah. (city rumble) - Yes, mom, I made it here safely. - What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. - Well, tony and I are always here if you need us. - I know, but I don't want you guys anymore wrapped up In this than you already are. I'll figure something out. - I just... I want you to be safe. - I know, I'm safe. I'm safer here than I was in greenville. Um... Has there been any word from him? - No. But if I hear anything, I will let you know. You should do something nice for yourself tonight. When was the last time you let yourself have a little fun? - Oh, I don't know, with everything... - Put on your favourite boots, the black-heeled ones, And take yourself out for a drink. You deserve it. - You know what? That sounds like a really good idea. I will do that. Thanks, mom. - I love you, kiddo. - I know, I love you too. (scream in the distance) (sombre music) - Julia confirmed us for the tasting, And claude said he can get you in for a fitting next week. - Wow, I don't know how you keep up with all this. - I am superwoman. Oh, did your mother get the test results back from dr. Henderson? - Inconclusive, again. (sighs) - Has she given anymore thought to selling the house? I'm just worried about her being there all alone when we move out. - I don't think she's ready to do that yet. What if we... What if we hired someone else? - What do you mean? - I love how much you love my mom, okay? I do. But you have so much on your plate right now, If we brought in someone else, someone to... Make mom their sole focus, It would take the stress off everyone. - Are you sure though? I mean, mary is doing such a good job. - Babe, mary's our housekeeper. I think we're asking way too much of her at this point. Why don't we just talk to my mom about it, hm? And go from there. - Okay. Bossy as always. - Bossy? I'm bossy? - Yeah, you're bossy. - Oh, I'm the bossy one? (overlapping chatter) (chuckling) (soft music) Hi, mom. - Ooh, hello, you two. - Do you need a hand? - No, just hand me my cane, would you? - Yeah. - Ah! - Anything else before I leave? - Uh no, I think that'll be it, thank you, mary. - Good night. - Mom, what do you say we go out for dinner tonight, Maybe rivicci's, if you're feeling up for it? - What are we celebrating? - Life. (chuckling) - oh well, alright then! - Let's go find you something to wear? I'll meet you down here. (soft music) - Uh, house red, please. Thank you. (indistinct chatter) (chuckling) - Oh, taylor, please tell mom about the pitch today. - It went really well. I think we have a real shot at acquiring the langfords. Mh-mmm. (phone ringing) - Oh, uh... Sorry. - I thought we had that handled? - We do, it's done. It's... Don't worry about it. - Did you hear that the entire langford family Is coming to our company's 40th anniversary party? - I didn't, but that's great news. (sighs) Uh, mom is the food okay? - Yes, it's fine, I'm just taking a quick intermission. - Okay. - Um, the greenbergs had mentioned that they would make A bid for the langfords if they ever decided to sell, Did that ever happen? - Yes, uh, yes, it did. - They did. - Yeah. - You know what? A little competition just makes life more interesting. Right? And I really don't think we need to worry about natalie and hollis. (chuckling) - no. No, we don't. - Will you excuse me, I just need to visit the... - Are you okay, mom? - Yeah, I'm just uh... A little dizzy spell, I think that's all... - Mom? Ooh! (exclaiming) - Are you okay? - Hi, I'm nora, I'm a registered nurse. May I? - Oh, yeah, please. - Lay her on her back. - Oh, hold on. - I'm just gonna loosen up your collar a little bit, And let's raise her legs just so they're above her heart. - Let's get your legs up. - How are you feeling? - Better. It was just a dizzy spell. - Could you touch your pointer finger to your nose for me? How are your fingers, any tingling? - No. No, it's going away now. - Okay. We could probably sit her up. One foot at a time here. - There we go, nice and easy. - You should probably get checked out, Just to make sure nothing more serious isn't going on. Is there someone that I could call for you? (sighs) - I'll give her doctor a call as soon as we get home. - Uh, mom, do you want to go to the hospital? - No, no, dear. I'm better now, it was just a dizzy spell. - Alright, well, in the meantime, Lots of fluids and, um, Just try to take it easy until you can see your doctor. - Nora, was it? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. - You okay? - Hmm. (sighs) - So, you know, taylor and I were talking today, And we think it might be a good idea, If you want to stay in the house, That we... Hire someone else to come in and help you with the day to day stuff. - That might be a good idea. It might be nice to have someone else around. (chuckling) - Okay, we'll start lining up the interviews then. But, uh, let's just get you home tonight, okay? (indistinct chatter) Uh, nora? Hi, I'm connor. Listen, I don't know your situation, employment Or otherwise, but we're actually interviewing caregivers For my mother tomorrow now. And we'd love if you could stop by. If you're interested, that is. Address is on the back. - I'd love to. Thank you. - Great. See you tomorrow. - Yeah. (city rumble) (mysterious music) - So why do you think emma was calling last night? - I don't know. I mean, maybe she heard about the engagement. I love you. I chose you. - You know she blames me for you guys splitting up, right? - Yeah, our breakup was definitely hard for her, But it had nothing to do with you. Okay, it did. Just... Just keep your distance, And I'll do the same. - Okay. - Okay. (birds chirping) (♪) (knocking) Nora, hi! - Good morning, mr. Covington. - Oh, you can just call me connor. Please, come in. Mom, nora's here. - Ooh, hello, nora! - Good morning, mrs. Covington. How are you feeling today? - Oh, much better. - Good, good. Your home is beautiful. - Oh, thank you. - We're so sorry that taylor couldn't be here, She had to head into the office today. Do you have a resumé? - Yes. - Thank you. - Connor, would you do the tour? - Oh, of course. Right this way. (clears throat) So, as you can see, my mother's in poor health. The doctors can't quite put their finger on what's going on. Rapid heart rate, fatigue, shortness of breath, Even the smallest of things are challenging for her at this point. So, I want to make sure she's comfortable and cared for While we figure it all out. - Of course. - Okay. Right this way. - This place really is something. - Yeah, my dad designed it. He restored it in the early 90s, After their construction business went national. - Wow! - My parents started in general contracting in the 80s, And grew to be one of the most sought-after building companies in north america. Built their whole business from the ground up. (intriguing music) Pun intended. Tell me about your last job. - I used to work for an elderly woman in greenville. - Oh, why did you leave? - Oh, mrs. Covington, your house is beautiful. I mean, this kitchen, I couldn't imagine getting to cook here every night. - Sadly, it doesn't get the attention it deserves. - Okay, so it looks like you've already got a schedule going here. - My daughter-in-law to be runs a very tight ship. - So this says that you're taking lansoprofen and divipril together, is that right? - Well, if that's what the schedule says... - Those two medications have very serious interactions when taken together. These easily could've caused your dizzy spell the other night. How long have you been on this schedule? - Oh, um... - I think she just started but I'll have to confirm with taylor. She's the one that talked to the doctor. - Uh, well, I could speak with taylor if you'd like, But in the meantime, you should really talk to Whoever prescribed you these and get this sorted out. - Have you taken your medication today, mom? - Oh dear, uh... - It looks like you haven't yet today, so you know what? Why don't we just hold off on it until you can speak with your doctor? - I'll call him as soon as we're done here. - Great. Uh, what's next? - Ooh, let me show you the sun room. - Oh, wow! (chuckling) - Are you okay, mom? - Just getting my bearings, it's... (sighs) So, do you enjoy gardening, nora? - Uh, yes. Yes, I love it. I would spend all day with flowers if I could. Especially if I had plants as magnificent as these. Although, these orchids are stunning, But I think they need a little new bark. If you change it out regularly it keeps the weeds and the pests down, But it also helps them bloom more often. - Oh! (phone ringing) - Oh. Oh! I am so sorry. I thought I put this on silent. - Oh, it's alright. Shall we continue the tour? - Yes, let's. Thank you, dear. Thank you so much for coming, dear. - It was my pleasure. - We'll be in touch. - Okay. (birds chirping) - Hello? - Hi, yes. I'm calling on behalf of nora reed. You were listed on her resume as a reference. - Hi! I'm so glad you called! Nora is fantastic, we just adore her. - Oh, and she worked for you in what capacity? - As a caregiver for my mother-in-law. - Hey, nora! Nora, open the door, I know you're in there! I just want to talk to you. Open the door! Nora! (knocking aggressively) nora! I'm not signing these divorce papers. Not until we talk about this. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (panting) (keys jangling) (phone ringing) - Hello, mr. Covington, I'm sorry I missed your call earlier. - Oh, not a problem. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - No, uh, no, nothing. - Good. So listen, we'd love to offer you the position. - Really? Um, oh wow. That's fantastic! Yes, I accept. - Great, would you like to come by tomorrow to discuss details? Let's say 9 am? - I will be there. - Thank you, nora. We'll see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, mr. Covington. (trembling breath) (cell phone vibrating) (menacing music) (birds chirping) - Okay. Here's your tea. - Thank you, dear. - You're welcome. Your coffee. - Thank you. - Don't forget, we have a cake-tasting this afternoon. And nora, I hate to do this to you but... - Are you okay to start today? We have a few fires we need to put out at the office. - Oh! Yeah, of course, I'm happy to help. - Thank you so much. I left a note with the hour and salary details, And I'm happy to chat about it when we get home. - And her medication list is-- - Oh, yeah, about that, Did you have a chance to speak with June's doctor About switching out either the lansoprofen or the divipril? - I did. Thank you for catching that. - Oh, I'm glad I did. - Anyway, her eating schedule and her dietary restrictions Are just on the side of the oven. - Great. I'm sure we'll be fine. - Oh, I know you will. - We have to go. - Yes. Okay. - Nora, thank you again. Mom. - Have a great day. - Bye. (sighs) And then there were two. (chuckling) Do you know how to play gin rummy? - I don't, actually. But I would love to learn. - Ooh. Come over here. - Okay. (chuckling) - Ooh! Don't forget you have to discard. (coughing) Oh... Would you mind getting me a bit of water? - Yep, of course. (mysterious music) Uh, actually, nora, could you make it tea? - Yes. - Thank you, dear. - Frank! Please, have a seat. What can I do for you? - Well, as you know, we have to run a diagnostic on the... Company's financials for the potential langford acquisition. We're bringing in a forensic accountant To do a deep dig into the financials, To ensure everything's in tiptop shape. Should they agree to sell to us. - Okay, uh... - Now, there's nothing to be concerned about. It's routine. I just wanted you to know so you'd have a heads up Before we dig in. - Alright, um, thank you, frank, I appreciate that. - You're welcome. - Hey! Sorry to interrupt, hi frank, how are you? - Hey, you. - Can I steal you away for a minute? I need to get your opinion on something. - Yeah, yeah. Are we good? Thank you. (knocking) - Hi. - Oh, hi. Who are you? - I'm nora, I work for the covingtons. Sorry, you are? - I'm emma. Is connor home? - No, he and taylor are at the office. - On a Sunday? - Would you like me to leave a message for him? - No, that's alright. I'll try him another time. - Oh, thank you, dear. Um, who was that? - Emma? What? - Emma? - Hmm, that's what she said. - That poor girl. - Why, who is she? (sighs) - She and connor were together for a long time. Before taylor. And when connor ended it, she took it very badly. She broke into taylor's office and trashed the place. - Oh... - So, just to be safe, if you see her again, Just keep your distance. - Okay. (clears throat) - Um, your turn. - Oh, good! (keys jangling) - Oh, my-- - hello, nora. What, you're not happy to see me? I just wanted to say hey, Let you know that I'm also new to the neighbourhood. I'd also like to say, that little stunt you pulled, Sneaking off into the night? So cliché. It actually worked. But alas, here we are. - Ben... - I will always find you, No matter where you go, no matter how hard you try. You know, I'm always two steps ahead, lee. Sorry, nora. Nice rebrand. - What do you want, ben? That new family you're working for, Do they know who you really are? About what happened to the last family you worked for? (tense music) I'll take that as a no. So what do you say, How about you get me what I'm owed, And I'll sign the divorce papers and be out of your life for good? - I'm not gonna steal from them. I think you should reconsider. Your mom's new place is cute. And I saw that she and tony got a dog. A great big one. Was that because of me? Get me into that house, Or I might just have to take a visit to your mom's new ranch. - I will call the police. I will. I will tell them-- - Do that-- do that and your mom will pay the price. You have a few days. Or I might just have to do it myself. (panting) (suspenseful music) (sighs) - Here you are. - Oh, thank you, dear. - You're welcome. Enjoy. - Yeah, this all looks good. - Good enough for the langfords to pick us over the greenbergs? (sighs) - I'm not sure. - So what do we do? - Okay. Set up a meeting with the langfords, See if we can appeal to their ethos. - We already tried that. They want to remain as objective as possible. Besides, they're coming to the party. - Okay, okay. Then let's set up a meeting with the greenbergs. Like a dinner or something. - You want to have dinner with our biggest rival In the middle of a heated bidding war? - Why not? Acquiring langfords was one of my dad's Biggest goals and we are this close to making it happen. I'll do anything at this point. - Okay. Fine. I'll set something up, We'll see what we can do. - Thank you. - You're welcome. See you at home. (sighs) - Good. - Afternoon, June! - Afternoon, mary. - Oh! - Good afternoon. - Hi, I... Who are you? - Oh, this is nora, my caregiver. - Oh, oh I didn't realize you were looking for someone to formally do that. - Is there a problem? - Uh, no. No, I've just been acting in that role for June For the past few months. - Well, we all felt that having an extra pair of hands around the house Would be a good idea. - Hmm. - Oh, and we replaced the vacuum. - Oh. - So just let me know if you need anything else. - Will do. It was nice to meet you. - You as well. Uh, June, I'm just gonna tidy up the kitchen. Where do you keep your extra paper towels? - Oh, in the garage. - Okay, thanks. (door slams) (door rattling) (knocking) June? June? I think I locked myself in. (vacuum cleaner whirring) (knocking loudly) hello? Mary? (engine revving) (ominous music) (panting) (knocking) hello?! (grunting) somebody help me! (panting) Somebody! (breathing heavily) - Just breathe, just breathe! Deep breath, deep breath. Shh, it's okay. - I just don't understand how this happened. - Me neither. - Well, that door has been finicky for a while now, I'll get the handyman in to fix it. - It's a good idea. And we should disable the push button keys until the door is fixed. Are you sure you don't want to take the afternoon off? We'd totally understand, I mean, I can handle June. - No, it's okay. - Are you sure? I'm already here. - I know, I know. But it's my job to give the care, not receive it, so. I'm fine. Why don't we get out of the house for a bit? It's the perfect day for it. - Hmm. You sure? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Thanks, mary. - Have fun. - What? Are you serious? - I know. - I mean, the last thing we need is that girl suing us Because she gets locked in our garage. - If that's even what happened. I mean, she could've set it up. Anyway, I'm happy to keep an eye on things here. I mean, it has just been me and June for years now. I know her routine. - No, that's a really good idea. Thank you, mary. I really appreciate it. I don't know what we would do without you. - Anything for your family. I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye. (♪) - Hey. - Hey. - We have a marketing meeting in two minutes. - Right, I'll be right there. Okay. - Hmm. Oh, what are those? - These are memory care cards. So the general idea is that they keep your mind in tiptop shape. - Hmm. Sounds like fun. - Do you want to try them? - Sure. - Okay. Name three state capitals. - Albany. Uh... - No? That's okay, we can just try a different card. Name three types of dog breed. - Poodle, labrador... Um. - I think we've had enough of these for today. June, it is so quiet here. - Hmm, that's one of the reasons roy and I chose this spot. We knew we'd be in the city a lot for work, So we wanted to create a space where we could relax and detach. - How long were you married? - Almost 35 years. - What was your secret? - Communication. Always communicate. - You know, I've been meaning to tell you. Your diamonds are... Spectacular. I don't think I've ever seen a ring like that before. - Oh... Roy had this made for our 20th wedding anniversary. - Must have cost a fortune. - Yes, it did! Oh, you should see the brooch he had made For when connor was born. That man loved to show his affection with diamonds. And art. I try to keep most of his pieces in a safe place, And then rotate them, when I remember. He was very good that way. He always chose things he knew would appreciate in value. - Well, I guess diamonds really are a girl's best friend. - Well, they're not an enemy. (chuckling) (soft music) - Natalie. Hollis. To what do we owe the pleasure? - So glad you could make it. We got your invite to dinner. - Yes. - But we felt this would be more appropriate. We aren't backing out of the langford bid, We need them to extend our company's capabilities. - Understood. As do we. But we wanted-- - No. No. There are no buts. We appreciate you trying to... What, bribe us? Give a sob story? Whatever you were going for, But us backing out of the langford deal is not going to happen. We're acquiring langfords. Okay? And we will do whatever we need to do to make that happen. The reign of the covingtons has been fun, but... I think it's time for somebody new to take over. Hey! We look forward to outbidding you. - Okay. Uh, thanks, guys. Can you give us the room? We'll figure out the next step here. - What just happened? - I'm not entirely sure. - Okay, so what are we gonna do? - We stay the course. - They threatened us! - I don't think they meant anything literally. This type of thing happens all the time. Our concern level, I think we should be at a four. On alert, but not hitting the panic button yet. I love your problem-solving face. I have to run some errands but... I'll see you at home. - Okay, see you at home. (gasps) Oh my god! Why are you like this? - Just needed a minute alone with you. Don't worry, no one saw. - You're ridiculous, this is a place of work, rex.. - Yes, my lady, it is. Did you hear about this audit thing frank's doing? - No. - Well, you didn't hear it from me, but They brought in a forensic accountant to make sure Everything checks out. - Okay, are you worried about them finding something? - Shouldn't be anything. - You're the cfo. Are you worried about them finding something or not? - No. Everything's fine. - Okay. Wait at least a minute before you come out after me. And do not do this again, I'm serious. - You are very sexy when you're serious. (scoffs) - gotta get home, rex, I'll see you later. (ominous music) Rex? (car beeps) (soft music) (phone chimes) - Okay, that is sketch as hell. Everyone is one the internet in one way or another. - I know. And I couldn't find anything substantial. I mean, no social media or anything. - Well, let me have steve look into it. I mean, he does background checks for a living. Consider it an early wedding present. - Okay. But if connor asks, this was your idea. (chuckling) - aye, aye, captain. Now, for the real reason we're here, your bridesmaid dresses. - Okay, I'm thinking, for the flowers, Definitely non-traditional, I'm thinking red. Is that crazy? - No, I love it! (suspenseful music) - So how was coffee with lucy? - It was good. Really good. Yeah. - Did we finally sort out all of the bridesmaid's dress drama? - Hmm, here's to hoping. Oh, I wanted to let you know. Just in case you do find out, Lucy is gonna have steve do an in-depth background check on nora, Just to be safe. I mean, we do it for all our employees Here in the company, so we should do it for people coming into our home. - Yeah. Uh, yeah, you're right. With everything going on, I didn't even think to do a background check Before hiring her, but absolutely. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - I'll see you later. - Mm-hmm. - Bye. (ominous music) (♪) (car door slams) (mysterious music) (men laughing) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) (gasps) (sighs) - What you did tonight was very dangerous. - I know, okay, but I needed to know what this was about. I mean, when you search her name, Nothing of substance comes up. - Lucy has steve doing a background check, right? (sighs) - yes. - Then you don't need to be following weird, ominous notes Left by crazy people on your car in the middle of the night. - Okay. I won't do it again. - Hey, you and mom are everything to me. - Somebody wanted me to have this. - How do we know it's about nora? - Uh, caregiver? Greenville? I mean, you don't think that's a huge coincidence? - Somebody is messing with you. Now please, please just come to me the next time this happens. - Okay. Promise. - Okay. Now let's get some sleep. We have some crazy days ahead of us before this deal closes. - Okay. Private home-care nurse, lee griswald, was accused today Of malpractice after the family she worked for Found her forcefully taking a patient to and from The doctors against their will. The reason for the appointments hasn't been confirmed, But the sources speculate the caregiver was suffering from Factitious disorder imposed on another Formerly known as munchausen by proxy. (sinister music) (sighs) (dial tone) - Hello, you've reached madisen peters at the daily star. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hi, this is taylor hayes, I'm calling in regards to an article you wrote about A caregiver named lee griswald.

I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all of it. My behaviour was childish and uncalled for but I-- - Really? Because leaving that note for taylor was insane. What exactly was your plan? - What? - Luring her to the park, that same stunt you pulled When we first started dating. I mean, It was romantic back then, I guess, but now it's just creepy. - Connor... I... It wasn't me, I swear. - Uh-huh. Just like you didn't trash taylor's office? - Connor, I told you I never did that. Check the security footage! - The footage you deleted? Emma, if you weren't there that night, Then why was your car outside the building? - Because I was there that night to talk to you! But I didn't go inside, I swear. You need to see this. - I can't do this anymore. - Connor, please. - It's over. You need to accept that. - Was that emma? - Yeah. It was. (car starts) - we can talk to the cops, you know? She's violated her restraining order more than once. - I'll take care of it. Let's just get to the office, alright? - Alright. - Oh. Thank you, dear. - I'm gonna make your lunch now so you can take your medication. (sighs) (suspenseful music) what are you doing? - Giving June her medication, she always gets it this time-- - After lunch, I know. All I a, saying is that this is what I am here for, To care for June. - I was only doing it because you-- - I know, I know, but this is my job And I would really prefer it if you'd let me do this. Thank you though. (sighs) (mysterious music) (dial tone) (phone ringing) - Hi, yes, I'm calling because I'd like to file An anonymous complaint against one of your teachers. I'll hold. (suspenseful music) (sighs) Hey. Are you okay? What's going on? - Uh... Yeah. Yeah. - No, I know you, you're not okay. Is it about emma? Because-- - no, no, why? What? - Well, I just heard that she was brought in For questioning today For inappropriate behaviour with a student. - Wha-- - I know. Sarah's daughters Go to hartwood high and they were just talking about it In the break room. - I can't believe that, um-- - I know. I know. That woman is dangerous. I mean, I'm so glad that she's out of your life. Out of our lives. - Yeah. - But if that's not it, then what is it? - Um... Not here. - Okay. - Here it is. - Oh, lovely. - You're okay to get started on the frosting? - Oh, yes. Sure. - I am going to call a pharmacy about your prescription. - Okay. (mysterious music) - All good? - Mm, all good. - Okay. You can do the honours. (sighs) - What? - Yeah. Frank said there's nothing to be concerned about. - But there could be. I mean, did he say when this started to happen? - Sometime in the last few years. - Okay, so then if someone is stealing from the company, Then it would be likely someone who was hired Right around the same time as the money started disappearing. - Not necessarily. It could be anyone. Like I said, just keep this between us, okay? - Yeah, okay, okay. My lips are sealed. (suspenseful music) - Oh. What are you doing? - Yeah, nothing. The... Yeah. There was a... There was a big spider web up there, so. But, I got it, so... So, we're good. I'm just gonna get back to June. (sighs) - Ooh, there they are. - Sorry, we got held up. (chuckles) - are you hungry? - Nora made the best chicken marsala I've ever had in my life. - Really? - Well, we cannot say no to that. - No, no, no. Uh, mom, where's your cane? - Oh, uh, I've been feeling a lot stronger recently. - She hasn't used it all day. - Nope. - Wow! I haven't seen you without a cane in years. Uh, nora, who are you and what have you done to my mother? (laughing) - Don't-- - did something happen? - Oh, no, I was just saying, Because my mom wasn't using her cane. - Oh. - I'll get out of your hair. Enjoy your dinner. I will see you all tomorrow for the party. - Thanks, nora. - Taylor, could I just speak to you for a second? - Of course, yeah. - So, you wanted me to let you know If I notice anything else odd-- - Yeah. - About nora? Well, this afternoon, I noticed her trying to move the camera out front. Now, I know she said she was going for a cobweb, But she was definitely trying to move the camera. - I don't know why she would do that. - I have no idea. I think you're right though, There's something definitely up with that girl. - Yeah, definitely. Okay, um, thank you. - Of course. - Okay. (humming) - nora! - Yeah. - I don't know what it is that you are up to, But whatever it is, I will figure it out. The covingtons are like family to me, And I won't let anything happen to them. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Ugh, the stunt in the garage. Trying to take over my duties, Weaselling your way into their lives. What are you after? Their money? - I'm not after anything. - Then why did you move the cameras? Yeah, that's what I thought. Look, I'm onto you. And as soon as I figure out what it is you're up to, I will have no problem exposing you to the covingtons. Or the police. - Goodnight mary. (sighs) - How was yoga? - Good. You should try it with me sometime. Might help with all that tension you're carrying. - I am not carrying tension. Okay, maybe a little. I will think about it. - That's all I'm asking. - What is this? - Part of the results of the background check. Steve still has a few more things to check out But I thought you should see this. - Nora's resume? - Now, I'm not supposed to know this, because the reports Are supposed to be confidential, but whatever. Looks like that number, the one nora put down as a reference, Is actually registered to her. Like, a web-based number. You can buy them online and link them to your cellphone provider number. - Why would she do that? - I don't know, but it's an odd thing to do If you've got nothing to hide. - Yeah, I'd say. (phone ringing) - yes, this is taylor hayes. - Hi, this is madisen peters returning your call. - Miss peters, thank you so much for calling me back. - It's my pleasure. What can I do for you? - The article you wrote a few years ago About a caregiver and malpractice. I'm just wondering, why were the charges dropped? - May I ask why you're interested? - Uh, the caregiver, she's being considered for a position With a friend of mine and so I just wanted to make sure That everything is above board. - Well, I can't really send you personal details, But I can say that that family, the wyatts, they're a mess. I'd stay far away from them if I were you. - Does the name nora reed ring a bell to you? - I don't remember any nora, but then again, This whole story was a while ago. Turns out it was the son or the brother just after insurance money. I gotta run, I'm getting another call. - Uh, okay. Thank you for your time. Bye. (sighs) Hi. - Hi. - Ah, what a day. - Hey, how'd it go? - Hey! Oh, it was great. You know it's always great to see luce. I didn't know that nora was coming in today? - I asked her to come. The plants needed a little extra help. - Oh, okay. How's the game? - I don't want to jinx it, but we're winning. (mysterious music) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - June, I will pick up that fertilizer first thing in the morning. - Ooh, thank you dear. - Can I get anything for you, taylor? - No, I'm fine. - Okay, great. Uh, well, I will see you all tomorrow. - Mm-hmm. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Babe, come sit down. - Um, I'm gonna join you in a bit. I'm gonna take a bath. - Okay. (sombre music) (phone rings) - Hello. - Hey. Hey, it's me. I just was calling to say that I love you. - I love you too, lee. Is everything alright? - Yeah. Yeah, it will be. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. - Nora, right? Look, I don't know what you've heard about me. - I don't want any part of this. Whatever-- - Can you just-- - whatever's going on with you-- - Make sure that connor gets this. Please. There's things in here he needs to know. (suspenseful music) - Here you go. - Ooh. - It's a big night tonight, so we need to keep hydrated. (chuckles) - thank you, dear. - Morning, nora. You want any coffee? - No, thank you. June, can I make you something to eat? - Ooh, thank you, yes. (phone ringing) - Would it be alright if I just took this phone call, I'll make you something right after. - Yes, of course dear, yes. Connor dear. - Yeah. - The lawyer sent over a copy of the new will this morning And I noticed there was no mention of the prenup. - I told you, mom, it's not necessary. Taylor and I have no plans on getting a divorce. (clears throat) - Well, it's just for safety. - I know, I know. But we don't, we don't need it. It's okay. (scoffs) (sinister music) - I don't know. I wish... (indistinct whispering) Yes, I know. Mm-hmm. Come on, I'm trying. Fine. - Is everything okay? - Yes. Yeah. Excuse me, I'll get back to June. Are you alright? - Um, actually, I'm feeling a bit under the weather. Would it be alright if I just laid down for a while? - Yeah, of course. (clears throat) - Oh, okay. Yeah, let's get you to bed. (sighs) - Nora. - I'll be up in a minute, June. (mysterious music) Taylor, who are you? - She can't go to the party like this. Have we called the doctor? - Yes. Four times. He's away for his daughter's wedding. - Mom, what do we do? We have to go to make the final bid to langford. - No, no. You go. I'll be alright. - I'll stay with her. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Of course. I'll get some fluids into you, We'll get this fever down. - Should we take separate vehicles? Just in case one of us wants to come back and check on her. - Yeah, that's probably a good idea. - You two go, have a good time. I'm in good hands. (chuckles) (mysterious music) - Hey. - Hi. - I'm headed out. - Hey. Okay. Sounds great. I'll meet you there. - Okay. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (sighs) (indistinct chatter) - Fantastic party, as per usual. - Thank you. Would you expect anything less? - From you? Of course not. Look, this is totally inappropriate timing, But steve just got back to me with the rest Of the background check, And there's a few things you should hear. - Okay. - So, your caregiver, Her legal name isn't nora reed, it's lenora reed griswald. That's why she had no social media accounts, They're not under nora reed. And... Her last patient nearly died of mysterious circumstances. - The headline. - Apparently, she was the caregiver for a family For years and something went wrong near the end. The family, mainly the son, claimed malpractice, But no charges were ever brought. - Who's the family? - They are the wyatts. And it looks like nora might be married to said son. - I bet nora was involved. Thank you so much. I need to go, okay? (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - Thank you, mr. Langford. We look forward to doing business with you. We did it, they're gonna sell to us. - Honey, congratulations. - I couldn't have done it without you. - Happy to help. When does the deal close? - Monday. On Monday, this company will be worth Double than what it is right now, can you believe that? - No, I cannot. - Let's get a glass of champagne to celebrate. - I would love to, but you know what? I'm gonna stop by the house and check on your mom. She's not feeling well and I'm really worried about her. - Are you sure? Did you want me to go with you? - No, no, no. It's okay. This is a huge night. You stay, okay? And I will call you with an update. Okay. - Okay. I love you. - I love you too. Bye. (gasps) - Time's up, lenora. Oh, don't look so surprised. The safe? - Yeah. - Where's the safe? - It's... It's the first door on your left up there. (panting) - You bitch. - What?! - You framed me! - I don't have time for this. Let go. (grunts) (grunts) - you used me! You said you loved me and that if I helped you, You would run away but you lied! - Yeah, I did! So what?! Get off me! - Huh? What are you gonna do about it, huh? - This! (grunts) (panting) (suspenseful music) - The code is 5-0-8-1. (electronic beeping) (sighs) - are you sure? - Yeah. I... Mm-hmm. (electronic beeping) (sighs) - what's the code? - Give me the code! - I-- - What is it?! - Okay, fine! It's 5-0-1-8. It's... I got it wrong. It's 1-8. Sorry. (electronic beeping) Ah! (groans) (panting) - Okay... Okay. - Nora?! (suspenseful music) (crashing) (panting) - Nora! What is going on? - Nora! - Oh my god, I am so-- - open this door! - Who is in there? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. - Nora! - It's ... It's my husband. - Open the door, nora. - My ex-husband. - Open the door! - He has been blackmailing me. He threatened me, He threatened... He threatened my life, he... He threatened my mom's life. If I didn't... - Nora. - Steal from June to pay him whatever he thinks I owe him. That's why I faked my references, Because I was so terrified that he would find me, But he found me anyways and now he's-- (indistinct shouting) he's in your basement. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, taylor. - It's okay, we're gonna handle this, okay? - Let me out. Nora. Please! (suspenseful music) (June): Nora. - It's gonna be okay, we're gonna figure it out, okay? (June): Is that you? (ben): Would you let me out? (June): What was that sound? (ben): Open up the door! - I need you to get upstairs, now. - Okay. - Move! (ben): Let me out! - Connor! Connor. - Frank. - I sincerely apologize for the timing Of what I'm about to tell you. - Is everything alright? - There's almost a million dollars Missing from the account. - What?! What are you talking about? - We got back the financial analysis. Apparently, rex veloz has been stealing money From the company the last few years. He's been sending it to an offshore account to someone Named hannah mathers. - Hannah mathers? Why does that name ring a bell? - Her father used to work for the company years ago. He was fired for discrepancies in reports. They've issued a warrant for rex's arrest. And we're doing a deeper dig into hannah mathers. But we, uh... I did find this. - Who's this? - Hannah mathers and her father. - Oh my god. Oh my god. - Hi June. Aw, you don't look so good. How was your tea? I had to up the dose earlier Because our little nora here was on the way out. - You poisoned her? - Ding ding ding! We have a winner. (sinister laugh) I have been, for months now, Slowly biding my time, waiting for you to die. But I had to make it look natural so nobody would ask for an autopsy report. Do you remember the name john mathers? Is that ringing any bells for you? - Uh... - Yeah, that's what I thought. You took everything from me. My father was a good man. He was an honest, hard-working man, And he didn't deserve what happened to him And if you had just listened to him, And if you had just heard his side of the story, He never would have started drinking, And he never would have gotten behind the wheel of that car. Stay right there! Did you know that connor and I are married? We have been for weeks. I'm sorry we couldn't invite you to the ceremony. It was really intimate. Right after we signed your new will. - You can't do that. - Oh, I can. Ah. And when all of this is over, it's gonna be mine. You don't have a prenup. - Taylor-- - That's not my name! - Okay. - And you. I was getting a little scared That my plan wasn't gonna work when you showed up. But then I realized that it's actually going more perfectly Than I could have ever imagined. And I know I shouldn't revel in it because you both have to die, But now I can finish what I started. Yeah, I can murder June, and I can pin it On the poor, desperate, Pathetic, money hungry caregiver with a dark past. (grunts) ah! - Uh, uh, I don't understand why you're doing this. (panting) - I just had a really, really weird chat with... Rex! Rex! Are you okay? What happened? - It's taylor... (coughing) She's not taylor, she's hannah. - I know. Lucy, call an ambulance! You're gonna be alright, okay? - Hello? 911. - Goodbye, June. (muffled cries) Ah! (grunting) Ah! (grunting) Ah! Ugh! (grunting) (faint sirens) - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - And my mom? - Yeah, she's okay. - Hang in there, mom! (grunts) (birds chirping) - Thank you so much for hosting lunch. My mom is so excited. - As am I. This place hasn't gotten nearly enough use recently. (chuckles) - yeah, no. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. - Oh, who was that? - That was emma. We are... Gonna have a drink tonight. - Hm. (knocking) - okay, that's my mom. Everything looks okay? - Everything looks great. I'll get the door. (sighs) - How are you? - Oh, I'm good. I am very good, thank you dear. (laughing) - Oh, wow. Look at all this. - Hi, mom. Now, I know you've met connor, but this is June. - Oh, how lovely to meet you. - Oh, the pleasure is all mine. Now, I hear you love orchids? - I do. - Well, the purple ones are just blooming, you have to see them. - How was the call with the lawyer? - Well, taylor and ben plead guilty to all charges, So it looks like they're gonna be sitting in jail for a long time. - And what about rex? - We're gonna settle outside of court, On the condition that he stays far away from our family. - He got very lucky. - In more ways than one. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. - The langford acquisition went through? - After everything that's happened, It looks like it's still happening. - Connor, that's great. - Yeah. Have you given anymore thought to our offer? - Yes. I have. And it is so generous, But I really need to go back to greenville. I want a fresh start and I want to be close to my mom. - I understand. I'm not sure my mom will, but I do. - Oh, mary. - Hm. - You have to see these. I have never seen orchids bloom like this. - Oh, I know. - It's the bark trick, I'm telling you. - Ha, now who did you think you learned that from? - I don't know. (laughing) - Show me this trick. - Come see. Subtitling: Difuze
