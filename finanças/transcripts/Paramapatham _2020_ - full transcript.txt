Time God, it was a great escape. Go away! The music is so loud, I'm having a headache. Oh, it's getting late. Hey, Jaya! - One minute, okay? - Sir Sathya wants to see you. - He is waiting for you inside. - He is? PEOPLE - Take care of these. - Sir? Complete these. Oh. Come in, Jaya. - What happened? - I got it, sir. Okay good. Let's talk to the boss. Come in, Jaya. Yes, come in. Please have a seat. So, Jaya... Do you have any recent information? Where is Kumar? I don't know, I tried calling him but he didn't answer my call. No replies to my texts either. Wait, let me call him and see. Hey. Wait for awhile, I got an important job right now. I'll talk to you later. Hey! No phones, keep it inside! Who are you? My name is Kumar. "Kokki" Kumar... Are you trying to show off here? Do you think you're Dhanush? No, sir. Why did you come here? I need to borrow money. Borrow money? Yes, sir. How much do you need? I need about RM10,000. RM10,000? You will pay back the sum without any problems, right? Dinesh! You took money from me but you don't know how to pay it back! Sir, please let go of my son. I will pay you the money soon. Sir, please let go of my son. Is everything okay over there? There is no problem, right? He asked for RM10,000. Do you have cash with you now? I do. Okay, give it to me. - You will pay it back properly, right? - Yes, I will. Okay, go. Look who's finally here! Usually, the tow truck pulls others. But here the tow truck is pulling itself! I'm not like you who makes a mess everywhere. Maybe you should be an archaeologist. You've just arrived, don't start a fight. Boss, One Teh O Ais. Boss, please pack one nasi goreng. Add a little spice. Add a little spice? Hey, enough! Why do you all keep calling me? He did, go ask him why. So, what's up? I went to Kausalya's this morning. So your wedding is set, I guess? When are you treating us? Listen to me first! Kausi asked me to come to her house and speak to her dad in the morning. So? Please tell me about yourself. So that we can get to know you. Sir, I'm Ganesh. That I already know. Continue. My father passed away. I only have my sister left. I'm a graduate. My job... I'm still searching for a job, sir. Still searching for a job? That means you're currently jobless... For your next meal, you're dependent on your sister. Why are you looking at me like that? You're probably wondering how I know so much about you. That's not all I know. I know all the details about you. You are well-educated. You have no bad habits. You don't have many friends too. Your parents... Died in an accident. All these didn't disturb me that much. Because it's all just casual news to me. But, one thing disturbed me so much. Yes. One thing... disturbed me a lot. It really disturbed me! Famous businessman KBR's daughter has been followed by Ganesh. He planned to get her to fall in love with him. Okay fine. When I try to figure it out and investigate further details... I thought about how to put an end to all of these. Then, I heard about something else... Businessman KBR's daughter, Kausalya and Ganesh, had fallen in love with each other. Fallen in love? After hearing about this, Would any father keep quiet? Why did you get up? Why did you get up? Please have a seat. Please have a seat. Sit down. How can you get angry at something like this? There's more, keep listening. I don't see any car or even motorbike. You took the bus here? You definitely came here by bus. Do you know what car my driver owns? I bought the car for him. Toyota Camry. From this, you would have known what our status is by now. What kind of father-in-law is he? Why did he do such a thing? Why didn't you say a word to him? What could I possibly say? He has a good point. I don't have a car, I don't have a job either. So what are you going to do about it? I really feel annoyed. If only I had a sister... She would really look hot! - Hey! - Hey! No, dude! If you had a sister like that... Never mind it. What's the big fuss with the job? You will surely get a job soon. What is Camry? You can buy bigger car than that! Even then, I just want to spend my life with her. Such touching words. How is Kausi doing now? She is doing good. But I haven't spoken to her yet. She is firm on her feelings for you, right? Until then, it shouldn't be a problem for you. Shall we all go out somewhere together? Where do you want to go? Let's just go out somewhere, to relax our minds. It's been so long since we all went out together. Hey, why do you keep looking at me? Okay, when are we leaving? Tomorrow? Wait. Tomorrow? Okay fine. I'm fine as long as it's after work. Should we really go out tomorrow? - We're going. - We're going. Okay. Where should we go? Hey, Aroon will take care of that. I'll be finishing work at 6 p.m. tomorrow. I'll be waiting for you all. Just come and pick me up. All right then. Okay, my packed fried rice is here. Come and fetch me tomorrow I need to bring food for my mom, so I'm going back now. Okay, your sister will be waiting for you. - Let's go. - Okay Let's go. Asleep already? Mom. Please wake up. I bought you food. Oh, my god! Have you eaten, son? I'm already done, Mom. You go on and eat. How was your work today, son? Was it hard at work today? No, Mom. Work was uneventful as usual. I'll be going out tomorrow though. You eat first, Mom. Sis, you're not asleep yet? What are you doing up so late? I had some work to finish up. That's why I'm still awake. Okay, I'm going to sleep. Have you eaten? I ate outside with Aroon and Jaya. Why do you look dull? Come over here. Come here. So, what happened? Nothing. You went to meet Kausi's father this morning, right? - Yes. - What happened? I'm not sure. I don't think it will work out right. Tell me what really happened? Actually... I don't have a job, right? He thinks I'm using that as an excuse. Her father really hurt my feelings. Hey... You will definitely get a job soon. You don't worry about all these things. You will definitely get a job! Be courageous! Okay? Okay. - Right, I'll go to sleep now. - Okay. One more thing... I'm going on a trip tomorrow for two days with my friends. Where are you guys going? Jaya, Aroon, and I will be going on an adventure trip. Aroon also coming with you guys? He'll bring you guys to jungle and all. Don't worry about us. We will be back home safely. You're going as four people, I'm worried that five of you will return. That won't happen. We'll make sure of it. Okay fine... - All right. - Okay. The world's richest temple is The Padmanabha Swami Temple. Sir, how do you pronounce the name? Pad-mana-bha Swa-mi. Did you get that? You can easily say that as Padmanabhana Swami. That temple is fully covered in gold. Pure gold. It is located in Kerala. And it was built in honor of Vishnu. It has been said that it was built 5,000 years ago. To this day, no one can ascertain the exact time period. But... within its walls lies a secret. In that temple, there is a total of seven caves... Six of which have been opened. Except for one whose doors refuse to open to this day. After opening six caves, there were gold and gems such as opals found inside along with other precious and priceless artifacts. The seventh cave has yet to be opened. Even with the help of technology, we're still unable to open the final door. Behind that temple there's bound to be precious gems, gold, and other priceless artifacts. When they took the effort to open it, the monks of that temple said that, "This temple is a road to hell." The entrance to hell is in this temple. Therefore they urged others to never open it. Only that person can open final door. Sir, you want us to believe in all those folklore? There are many things that seem unbelievable. That is the beginning of Knowledge for those that do not know... In such approach, we must convince everyone and everything. Got it? Learn everything. Hello, Aroon. I'll meet you all next Saturday, okay? That sounds like an interesting topic, sir. It was indeed. I was sharing about our culture and traditions to our youngsters. And the writings handed down by our ancestors. It's never easy to explain and make them understand. But I'm trying my best to ensure that. How is your research coming along? My research? I'm mainly researching about Gunung Jerai, Lembah Bujang and the area around it, sir. - Have you analyzed the places? - It's still ongoing, sir. If you're free right now, we could discuss it thoroughly. Well, I'm going on a trip today. Can I meet you after my trip? Definitely. -You're welcome to my office -Okay, sir. - Thank you, sir. - You can drop by anytime! Why did you want to meet up? I told you that we broke up, right? Listen, this Camry, house, and money. I can't give you all of that! Just as your father said... You have to marry someone from own status, okay? I keep talking here and you don't say anything. Let go of my hand! I don't want anything. Let my father take care of everything. For me... You're enough. I didn't catch that. You're good enough for me. It's always been you. Let's leave before my boss sees me! It looks like you planned it all before you left for work. It's all according to our plans. Hey, you all seem well prepared. It seems like I'm the only one who's not prepared at all. Hey Ganesh, is your phone ringing? No, it sounds like it's beside you. Hey Jaya, your phone's ringing. What? Really now? Right, it's my alarm going off. What is this? Why did you set an alarm for six in the evening? It's nothing man, my work usually finishes at that time. So, out of habit, I set it at 6:00 p.m. It gives me a strange feeling of joy... It reminds me of those days in school when the bell rings to end the day. Doesn't that make you happy? That 6:00 p.m. alarm doesn't remind me of my school days. I think it's to remind you to call someone. Are you updating Kausalya? We have to update, dude. If not, there would be a big fight! Soon, he'll update grocery lists to her. You think you're the only one? I can do that too. Oh, man. I forgot that I'm single and I've no one to give updates to. Never mind, let's just go. Life, don't leave without living it Honesty is never out of line Human never change your nature The world will praise you my friend The winds can't be stopped There is no limit to the sky The world can't stop spinning You don't need to lock down your life Every place is home Everyone is family... Where are you all bringing me this early? You won't let me do my morning routine? Come on, I will bring you to a mysterious place. Now it's time for the camera. He is bringing us to deep jungle. There is a No Entry sign board here. Hey Kumar, watch where your step. The bridge looks very old and unstable. The engineer called it. Hey, watch your step. This is a very old place. Not bad. I didn't know they already had this architectural style. Guys, this was British Colony, built during the year 1800. Colony? Many British people would have lived here. - Come, let's take a selfie! - You won't let us? Hey, look at that! Kumar, look at that! Just look at it, guys! What a huge house! Look at how scary it is in broad daylight! I think this is the main entrance. Oh no, he's going to open The Conjuring door. Why are you all just watching? Come and help me! Coming. How old is this door? It's very hard to open it. At last, he used me to open The Conjuring door. Why do you get these kinds of places? What a nice view, dude! There's a cave here! You won't fit anyway. That's pretty brutal. Look there! Aroon, this is the colony you mentioned. Kumar, this colony was built in the 1800s by the British. The big house on the right is a guest house. Even during the British reign, this place has been abandoned Not only that, I heard that there are many mysteries here. So you purposely brought us here. You knew about this. Right, Aroon? Come here, guys. He brought us back to the house again? So many doors here. How far does it go? Oh! This damn door. Hey! Look at him. Oh, my god. Hey, why are you laughing? Come here quickly! Next time when you take photo, don't forget to look at the floor. - Are you okay? - Your leg isn't hurt? This is bound to happen with they way you take pictures. What is inside there? What is this? It's so dark down there. There seems to be a hidden passage inside. - Wait, let's go down and see. - Be careful! Aroon, why are you going down now? Ganesh, you should go too. Hey, Aroon. Don't go down alone, let me come with you too. It's dark in here. Please don't ask me to come down. Watch your step. Shine the flashlight over here, would you? Sure, it's over here. There is nothing over here. Have you noticed anything so far? This place is... What about Aroon? He found something already. Hey, what's over here? Oh no, it looks like he did see something here. It looks like a wooden box. Here, hold this for me This thing is really heavy. What Aroon? It's completely made of wood. I don't know what it is exactly. Hey, help me hold this. - Be careful with it. - What is this, buddy? Hey Jaya... Put that wooden block over here. Here you go. It looks different! - Give me that. - Look here, it's spinning. I want to record it for my research. I guess by spinning it, we can open it? I can't open the ring below. It's opened already. Hey, why did you guys open it? SNAKES AND LADDERS It looks like a gameboard! Aroon, it looks antique! Yes, this is an ancient gameboard. This looks like a roll of dice. Hey, pink! It's for me. - Is this Snakes and Ladders? - Yes. - But why the numbers are up to 96 only? - Come on, let's play. It's supposed to be 100. So I take the blue one. White color for me. - Why are you all taking the pieces? - Come on, let's just play it. - Take it, man! - Come, let's play! So, you gave me the last one, Green. Nice roll! Is this why you refuse to play? Let's continue playing on. - Hey! You got the snake bite! - Now, you're going down! I was ahead, you know! I could've won this! No, this game is cheating on me. I don't want to continue this anymore! I won't accept it. I could've won this! Never mind, let's continue. I'm not playing, I'll go back. You guys continue playing it. - Hey. - Finish this game before you go back! You guys finish it. I'll wait outside. Leave him be, let's continue. You're not going to stop this. Wait, what are you doing? It's okay if we skip Ganesh's turn. - Let's continue when he's around. - Let's pack up. I will take this board game back And use it for my research. Hello, Aroon, congratulations. I just read your article. I'm really proud of you. - My article? - Yes. Where is it? The one about your research got published on the front page of the magazine. I can't stress how proud I am of your accomplishment. When I come back, I'll treat you to a meal. After you come back? That means you'd be traveling, sir? Yes, I got a flight at 12 noon later for a conference in Johor Bahru. I will see you once I'm back here. Okay, sir. Have a safe journey, sir. - Hey, Buddy! - Hey, Jaya! Why? What's the matter? Okay fine. Tell me what's the matter? Everyone knows it! You're suddenly famous after publishing your article. How do you know? Let's leave it at that. I'm the first to congratulate you, right? No, my professor called me just now. - I missed it. - You missed. His treat? No, he's catching a noon flight to Johor Bharu. - He'll be back after two days. - Two days? He'll treat us to a meal after that. Fine but you must let me interview you. I'll make you famous! Looks like you're not letting me go. Of course, not. Sit down. Sis... What are you cooking today? Well, it's sardine sambal. You'll kill me with those daily sardines. You only have one concern. That girl you're in love with, marry her and bring her here. She would cook various dishes for you. Why? You want all of us to go to heaven? Okay fine. Let me know when you're done cooking, I'll be there. What? Where are you going? Cut this for me. You want me to cut this? Yes, cut it into smaller pieces. Hey, Buffalo! Reduce the volume and listen to it. I will not be able to hear if the calling bell is ringing. You're crazy. Who the heck is that? Ringing the calling bell when I'm listening to good music. I can't even listen to songs in peace. Hey, how is it that you're here? What happened? My father has agreed to our marriage! Your father has agreed? Here. - This is impossible. - Isn't it? Are you for real? Hey! What's going on here? Hey, who's this girl? This is... Well, she is... You kept photos of her, right? All over your room? - Yes. - Well? Hey, why are you acting all shy now? My brother is feeling shy? Fine. You thought you could talk at the front door. And then send her off quickly? Please come inside. Now, how did you end up with him? - Please don't make fun of me. - Oh, hush! - Do you know how to cook? - Yes, I'm a good cook! Hey, Ganesh, you can leave me now. You don't even know how to cover news properly. I don't even know, what else can I do with you people. Do you think you can spend the next six months like this? No, sir. My partner is not good. Partner? Balakumara? Get back to work. PEOPLE You guys? So why do you both look so dull? - That Sathya! - Hey, hush. That Sathya is giving us trouble. - Why are you surprised? - You're going to regret that. - I'd be careful if I were you. - Okay. Okay. Jaya? Sir? I'll ask him to come. Mr. Janaarthan is calling you.

Beat him down! Hey! Enough! Hey! You expect me to believe that? You expect me to believe that? Sir, I swear on my mother, This is what has happened... I'm just a poor boy living my life, borrowing money from you. Why do I need to do something like that? Please let me go, sir. I won't tell anyone about what happened here. Please let me go, sir. Michael. Let him go. We misjudged him. He is not worth it at all. He's bad luck now. You can let him go. Fine, go. Hey. Look here. You coming here, and what you saw here. If you let anyone else out there know... You know what happened just now, right? Go! Superb! I am really astonished. Mr. Janarthan and Mr.Sathya Jaya...

Why are you sending people to my house? Hey! Don't talk too much. Just do as I said. Are you coming? Or do you want me to do it? There's no need, boss. I'll go there. Boss, I brought him. Sir, why did you ask me to come here? I already promised that I won't tell anyone about you. Stop it. Michael. Here you go! Sir, what is this? Why are you giving me this? RM10,000! RM10,000? Why give me so much money? Hey. Don't be afraid. The money that I'm giving you today And the money that you took as a loan. You don't have to pay it back to me. But... What you saw today, and what you saw the other day too. If anything gets leaked... Michael. I'll cut your throat! Go away! How come only you get these things? Who am I then? Both of us are from the same department. But you show more enthusiasm, it's why you're out there. While I'm inside, sitting around. What can I do? You got busy lately. I've been out and about and I found a result. Okay. Tell me more about this. Paramapatham. Our Tamil ancestors' game The game played by grandparents and their grandchildren, in the courtyard and temple courts back in the day. During Rajenthira Cholas rule, he brought many ancient and unique things to Kedah. That's how this board game arrived here. Later in the 1800s, The British conquered the land. One of them is Col. William Light, a nobleman who settled in Penang. He found many artifacts in Jerai Hill. It's where King Chola ruled years earlier. Among these is a board game. William brought it back to his Hotel in Penang. He found four friends, including himself, to play the board game. They all died a few months later. In the following year, their families disappeared without a trace. The only person who knew all of this was Perumalsamy, a translator of William. He wrote down all this information on a note and hid it with board game under the hotel. Perumalsamy feared the Paramapatham. That's quite a story surrounding the game. It's very interesting to listen to. I'll help with this research. Fine... Okay. I'll give you a USB flash drive. Bring that back first. You'll copy all the files inside it. One of these days, when I come and meet you at the university, we shall continue the research again. Pass these files to the Professor first. - Okay? - Sure. Take this data to the university first. I'll meet you there, okay? - Sure, we meet there. - Okay fine. It looks like KBR uncle's car. It's him. He accepted the wedding. He even commended the job interview. But I never thanked him. I still have some time left. I'll follow him and thank him. Vajra! All this time, you keep messing around! And now, you've dragged me again! That's why I asked you to be my partner, but you didn't listen. Be your partner? Only people of quality are my partners. You missed that chance ten years ago. Quality? What is that, sir? Trust! You need trust! You broke that trust in this partnership, you have done illegal activities for the sake of money. You are worthless. How dare you! Uncle! The boss is here. This is why we don't hire young boys. While the boss is here, no one gets to react. Ask him to leave! Ganesh, how did you get here? Why did you come here? That's okay, sir. You? Vajra? I don't understand this! Wait, who is this young boy? Don't waste your blood. Uncle won't have any back up. KBR! Take him to hospital. Go on! There's no point talking with you. I know how to get to you. Ganesh, let's go. One day, we'll have this conversation. Vajra is crossing his limit. Yes, after messing around with others he now tries to mess with me. He beat up my son-in-law. He will regret doing this. We must do something. Sir, what happened? Come. Sit. Who is this Vajra? What's the issue between the two of you? I guess I can't hide it from you anymore. One of the respected people in the town is Vajramurthy. But he has another hidden face. Few years ago, my first business is moneylending. I have a friend named Jaana. During that time, Vajramurthy had just started working. He was interested and talented. Soon he learned the business tricks. I assumed he learned due to his talent. It was only later that realized he learned because he loved money. Because of this desire for money, he committed many illegal activities without me knowing about it. Kidnapping, smuggling, drugs, gangsterism, among other things. When I was still unaware of it, I gave him a shop to start his business. One day, I found a drug packet in that shop. After that, I began noticing all of his illegal activities. I was outraged, took over the shop, and chased him away. The next day, he planned to kill me. Sir, please forgive me. Please convince him. Everything I have in life is because of you. I'm begging you. I won't repeat these mistakes again. Are you trying to act smart? You have lied to me! Even now, you called me here to finish me, right? Move, leave! Leave now! At that time, the one who saved me is Janaa. That was the last time I saw Vajramurthy. After that, I hardly met him. Sir, how about Janaa? Yes, he is around. We still keep in touch. He is the Manager at Makkal Osai Office. I'm a businessman now. We have good contacts which we gradually we established. Let's go. What happened guys? Why are you late? Don't worry about me, what happened to both of you? What happened? Dude, what's all this? I went unscathed, Machi. Look at him. He's already swollen. Now he's even bigger. Dude, don't play around. Fine. Let us know the true story. I was going home after work, I fell on a hollow pit and got injured. It doesn't look like it. Fell in the hole? More like beaten by ten people. No, not like that. Okay, what happened to your hand? Be honest. It's a big secret. My father-in-law is in big trouble. I went to save him. A guy cleaved me with a knife. What is this? Someone called Vajra. Hey? Then how is this possible? The knife, dude. Knife? Dude, open it. It's not that deep. I'm fine, leave it alone. Just open it. Let's see. Dude! What is this? It's just a wound. Not that. This! Dude! You got tattoo! Since when did I have one? It's a symbol. Symbol? What symbol? Dude, it's from that game. The board game... Dude, so what's wrong? Dude, remember we played the board game a few days ago? Oh, okay. Wait. Don't confuse us. This is the issue between Vajra and my father-in-law. This was from the accident, that's all. Dude! I'm not confused. It's not one, there are many hidden details here. Dude, simplify it. Don't confuse us more. Dude, it's not like that, okay? In your case, everyone knows your job. But how are you able to get promoted within four days? Never mind. Leave it. You had an issue with your father-in-law. You said he humiliated you. So how did he suddenly agree to your wedding? Have you asked Kausi about this? Kausi? No, I haven't. I see. Okay! You! You said that you fall on a hollow pit. But you look like you got ganged up by ten people Dude, I really fell on a hollow pit. Okay. Bonus? How? The bonus was from I working. What's wrong with that? Dude, it's not an isolated case. It's happening to me too. Dude, you remember the magazine I did? I did that project six months ago. Now I got the award. One of the best too. I never saw that coming. Fine. How can you say it's related to the board game? Dude, it's simple, okay? We played that game. Sunday evening at 6:00 p.m. Everything starts from that particular time. I got the news about the magazine on Monday morning at ten. Don't you guys remember? My first ladder was at number 16. Hey, wait! Kausi showed up to my house on Monday at ten in the morning. My father has agreed to our marriage! Monday morning at ten? Hey, wait! Hey, do you remember? You recorded with my phone. Yes, I recorded it. I have listed separately the snakes and ladders when we played. Based on my calculation, we start the game on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. On Monday morning at ten, I got the news. Dude, 42? So for me, it's at 12 p.m. On Tuesday at 12 pm, I got my promotion. Calculating from Sunday evening 6 p.m. I got my promotion after 42 hours. You will be a senior reporter for Makkal Osai. But Kumar got the ladder at number 18. No. He got snake before that. 33. If calculate from 33... Tuesday early morning around... 3 a.m. Tuesday at 3 a.m. and 12 hours from there... Tuesday evening at three, there must be something good that happened to you. Here you go! RM10,000 Yes, my boss gave me the bonus that day. Then, the snake I got at number 80? This morning what time was the interview? What time did you leave for it? Around seven or seven thirty in the morning. The same time. If that the case, it's only 51 hours. - Dude, I mean... - Wait. He got a ladder from 16 to 33, right? - It should be correct then. - Right. Aroon! Based on your explanation, even if this related, we never finished the game. Dude, you never finished it. But even then, we left midgame. Now that symbol in your hand... Everyone check your hand. Dude, you are left-handed. Look over there. Dude! Dude, what is this? What is happening here? Dude, do you know anything else about this board game symbol? I have been researching about this board game these past two days. There is a history behind this. But it's not important now, given that I noticed it relates to our lives. Aroon, I'm scared. Dude, nothing will happen. No worries. I will go to meet the Professor first. Because the ladders and snakes for everyone have been used. So the game can be paused. But first, I will meet my professor. Okay? - Hey! - What? What's wrong with you? No, I just can't understand this. Dude, no worries. Let's go. Oh God! I hope all will be fine. What is happening? All of Vajra's people are being caught. Huh? I can't understand that as well. What's confusing? What is it? My dudes, it's getting serious. We must be very careful. Michael! Dinesh is not answering my calls. Pandia is also not answering. What is the matter? Boss, our people have been caught by the police. One by one they're catching our men. What is the matter, Michael? It's not possible. I still don't get it. I thought nothing will happen beyond our control. Now they caught all our guys. Okay, Michael. I'll take care of it. Boss, don't use your black car. They have marked you. Use another car. Be safe. Vajra's empire is no more. VAJRA'S TRUE FACE REVEALED Vajra! A familiar name to all of you. A well-known businessman. Owner of many established shops. Import and export dealer. At Yang district, he is the Harbor King. Without his knowledge, not even a single boat can enter or leave the port. All this... Just to hide from the people. Behind this tremendous growth, lies a hidden side of him. Who is this Vajra? What is he doing? Vajra, Gangster! Mafia! Don! In Malaysia, he is the number one drug dealer. A loan shark. He is involved in many illegal activities. We all have records of his illegal activities, where it seemed hard to reach him. By gathering evidence against him, we are able to create a profile. His left is Michael. Right is Pandia. With many gangster and youngsters, he is able to do his business. He uses youngsters to distribute the drugs. It's his technique. Any news on Vajra? We have started it from Vajra's base. It's starts from now. No one is even able to walk near Vajra's empire. Secretly, we had to follow his every move. We monitored closely and gathered a lot of evidence against him. You're going to take an interesting interview today. You're going to interview VKN Jeweller's owner. Go and ask him. Go and ask. But he won't agree. Because of Vajra! Vajra is not the center point, but a mere Black Dot in this society. For Jaya's effort, In Malaysia, many Indians flourish in the education and business sectors. Our Indian students have even achieved success abroad. But criminals like this, are the disease of our society. Besides police officers' efforts, we also need to help them. We must destroy everything planted by that Vajra. Put this news in the headlines. - Come, Aroon. - You said want to meet me tomorrow. But you are here today. Yes, sir. It's urgent. So the photos that you sent are related to this board game. Yes, sir. Because of this, a lot has happened to us in four days. Due to what you said just now, the snakes and ladders in this board game play a role in all of your pasts. Yes, sir but because of this... Wait! What is this? It's Snakes and Ladders, sir. We saw similar symbols on Kumar and Ganesh. Infinity! Sir? Infinity! Observe it from a distance. What is this? Sir, it's a keyhole. But... Did you get the key? - I don't know, sir. But that day... - It's okay. Okay, Aroon. When did you play this game? - Sunday evening around... - No. Date? January 8, sir. January 8? Vaigunda Egathesi. Sir... Are these two connected? It's related. Paramapatham! I'm sure you would have done research about this game. After Thiruvalluvar year, it's just an entertaining game. Especially, on Vaigunde Egathesi day. To stay awake the whole night, our ancestors played this game. Before Thiruvalluvar year whatever our elders have done had a reason behind it. For example, Kailasyam Temple which was crafted from one big rock. Tanjai Big Temple... stands without a shadow to this day. Finally, we have Padmanabeswamy. The seventh door that can't be opened until now. All of these are still a mystery to us. Sir, is this a supernatural thing? Not supernatural Only undiscovered. Many years ago, our Indians were professional on magic and tricks. Are you aware of it? Not only that, for example, sun, moon, and 24. All of this indicates a time zone. All the changes are the tricks of time. Okay. What else have you noticed? On your friend's hand, This symbol appeared. Anything else? Sir... I was unable to move any of the dice. But now it moved to a different number. It moved in reverse order. Okay. Let's have a look. There is something wrong. If this game is related to your life and it reverses, your time ends. Wait, this pink dice belongs to whom? Sir, it belongs to Ganesh. Aroon! Go and meet Ganesh now. In my opinion, you guys should end this game. But you didn't. Just start already! It's getting late. Shit! Let's ask for sir's car. Yes. - Wait! - Sir. Sir, my car broke down. Could you please lend me your Hilux? - You go fast, go. - Thanks, sir. Okay, sir. Yes, hello. Hey Kumar! Hey, what happened? What happened to Ganesh? Dude, I'm not sure. He's been like that since I arrived. He's been like that We couldn't do anything. Dude, what time did you arrive here? Do you know anything? His sister called me and I just arrived. He just lying on his bed. Okay, wait. Sister! Sister! Aroon, look at him. I'm trying to wake him up but he's not responding. What happened? I came to change his bandage. After that, he didn't wake up. He didn't wake up. Aroon!!! - Hey, Ganesh! - Calm down, please. - Wake up, Ganesh! - Don't cry! Kausalya! Look at this, tell him to wake up. Dad planned for our wedding too. Doctor. Have you called the doctor? Dad will bring the doctor. Don't cry. - Ganesh! - Hey, Ganesh! - Ganesh! Wake up. - What happened to you? - Wake up! - What caused this? - Ganesh, wake up! - Ganesh, look at me! Ganesh, wake up! - Hey, Ganesh! - Ganesh, wake up! Kumar, how does he look? His skin is colored blue. I notice it too, Kumar! Something has happened. Something's wrong here. I don't know, he looked bluish ever since I arrived. Kumar, it's related to the board game. I just got back from the Professor's house. - Kumar, the symbol on his hand! - I know dude! Wait, let me check first. Aroon, what happened? - Why are you doing this, Aroon? - There's nothing to worry about. Tell me Aroon. What happened Aroon? - It's nothing Kausalya. - What happened? - It's nothing. - What happened? - Tell me please? - Ganesh! - Hey, Kumar! - Yes, Aroon? The symbol on his hand is in its complete form! Look at it! - What happened? - Nothing sister. Come here Kumar. Hey, Kumar! Have you seen his hand? - That symbol! - What does it mean, dude? We saw half of it this evening, Now it's complete! - Something mysterious is happening! - I know, man! After visiting the Professor, I need to tell you something. Only the two of us can see The bluish body and the symbol! Kausaliya and sister can't see these and they don't know what's happening. You have the symbol on your arm, right? You have the symbol too, right? Check your arm! - Hey! - What is this, dude? That symbol on your hand... - The symbol is halfway complete. - Hey! Hey! You're at risk. Hey, follow me! Let me go! I won't leave Ganesh! Are you going to die with him? Come on! Hello? What are you doing? I'm waiting in front of your office. - In front of the office? - Yes, hurry up! Okay, I'm coming. Hey, what happened? Why call me at this hour? - Hey, Aroon! - Kumar tell him. - Ganesh passed away, Jaya. - What's he saying, Aroon? Jaya, listen to me. First, we need to go to the Crag Hotel. We need to finish the game first. What's this now? Crag Hotel? Go to Ganesh's house, first. I want to see him. - Jaya, listen to him. - No! I need to see him! Go to Ganesh's house! Do you want Kumar to die like Ganesh? Oh, man! Ganesh died because of this board game! Now, it's Kumar's turn! Kumar only has an hour to continue his turn! We must finish this game! I will explain everything to you once the game is completed. Hurry up! Take the wood. Hey, take your last positions. Check the time! - Are you fine, Kumar? No issues? - Dude! So far, so good Aroon. I'm fine. Hey, Kumar! No! - Hey! Who did that? - Hey! VAJRA'S TRUE FACE WAS REVEALED JOURNALIST JAYAKANTHAN Hey! What's up? You played the game without knowing the consequences. You crossed the line now! Vajra's empire is huge! And you demolished it to the ground! Neither of you can leave this place alive! Hey! Come and fight me! No! Don't shoot him! Do you think this is child's play? Not bad! You are playing tricks well. Hey! Vajra! Come at me! Is that all you've got? Come fight! I'm a demon! Kill him! Enough! Don't kill him! We have to finish the game first! Sit down! Hey! It's your turn now! Jaya you got ladder! Jaya! Key! - We need the key to complete this game. - You're right! - Let's go find it! - We have to find it! - Hurry up, Jaya! - I know. The key must be here. Search carefully, Aroon! - It must be somewhere around here. - Aroon, did you find it? Here... - What is this? - Aroon! Yes! This is the one. Jaya, I got it! Okay! Let's go! Okay! Now it's my turn. Two. Shit! It's a snake! - Aroon, it's a snake. - Leave it! - Roll the dice. - Something bad might happen. Jaya, leave it alone It's your turn, now roll the dice. We finished the game! Hey! Hey! Jaya, close the board game first! Ignore him, Jaya. Close the board game! Close the board game! Close the board game! Lock it with the key! The sound has stopped. Let's lock it with this key. Let's finish this game! What's happening? Everyone's dead. The game is finished. What's next? How did they disappear? I don't understand anything. There's no call or anything here? But the ringtone... Everything going back to the time it started? The game got reset? So Jaya, you are telling me that, you all went for a trip, and you found the board game there. Once everyone insist to play, only Aroon refused. But everyone, eventually played. By the end, everyone died. But Jaya, you are the one only who escaped death's clutches. Yes, sir. You don't believe me? I didn't say that I don't believe. But at least make sure it's believable. Aroon, do you know about déjà vu? I do. I feel that something has already happened in our past life. Something that connects us to a specific place or time. Sir, we were here just now the same day at 9:00 a.m. You got a flight to catch up to a conference in 12 noon, right? Jaya! How do you know about this? How do you know? I didn't share this with anyone. How do you know about this? It's already happened before. It's already happened before? What is this game, Jaya? - Paramapatham, sir. - Snakes and Ladders game. It originated in India. Our ancestors created this many centuries ago. How do you know about this, sir? Paramapatham is not an ordinary game. Look at this, The Sun, the Moon, and 24 numbers. - You mean 24 hours? - Yes. The Sun represents 12 months. The Moon represents 30 days. And this one, it's a clock. Sir! Please don't. Then this board game will open by itself. Is there a locking mechanism? It's only possible if opened from the right position. But this is not like that. There must be another option. Let's see what's behind this board. "The Sun symbolizes 12 months." "The Moon symbolizes 30 days." "When you start a game, karma plays a role accordingly!" "The coin moves when the dice rolls!" "Magic will happen and opportunities will be abundant." "Play Paramapatham to surrender yourself to the gods." "The snake catches you for your sins!" "The ladders work in your favor." "Your hands will turn the key!" Aroon, you're also dead by the time I finish this game. But that gunshot was meant for me. But now, everything has come to an end. Because everything was tied to the game, we have now reached the end. But with this end, comes a new beginning. ♪ Win or lose the journey continues ♪ ♪ Unknown machinations scatter ♪ ♪ Fight bravely until the Mystery is solved ♪ ♪ The face of brave The daring Paramapatham ♪ ♪ Paramapatham ♪ ♪ Overcoming obstacles Is in Tamil history ♪ ♪ As time goes, the truth Will be revealed ♪ ♪ Kadaaram's Guardian Cholan's secret ♪ ♪ A wonder of the world The daring Paramapatham ♪ ♪ As dice chases vengeance ♪ ♪ The ladder pushes you to the heavens ♪ ♪ The snake incarnate ♪ ♪ Don't be afraid friend ♪ ♪ Face the battlefield ♪ ♪ Move forward in this daring game ♪ ♪ Stand firm against the death ♪ ♪ No way to lose ♪ ♪ Start the game!
