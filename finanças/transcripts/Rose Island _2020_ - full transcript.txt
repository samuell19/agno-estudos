BASED ON A TRUE STORY NETFLIX PRESENTS STRASBOURG NOVEMBER 1968 Mr. Gary. That man looks really ill. Who is he? Wasn't he here yesterday as well? He's been here all week. He's an Italian engineer. That weird car outside, is that his? Yes, it is. He desperately wants you to read a file he's brought. I didn't want to bother you with it. Did you tell him we deal with disputes between sovereign states? He says he's a head of state, and that he won't leave until I give you the file. He's a bit crazy but also very determined. This is what we're going to do. Hand me the file, and make it look like a big deal. Here's the file I told you about. Thank you. I'll read it very carefully. Very well. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Where is he? -Who? -The mad man with pneumonia. -I managed to get rid of him. -No! Bring him to my office. I need to talk to him. Come on, quick! Mr. Rosa, I have to ask you if you know what day it is and where you are. November 10th, 1968, Strasbourg, Council of Europe. And what can the Council of Europe do for you, Mr. Rosa? Save my island. Did you buy an island? No, I made it. He created an island. How many days did it take you to create this island? Please, don't say six, that would be an incredible coincidence. No, it wasn't six days. It took me several months. So you own an island that you have created. No, I didn't say that. I'm an engineer. I simply built it, then… we created the world on the island… I should just leave. This man's in a confused state. He needs help but clearly not from us. I need help from the European Council. That's why I'm here. Keep calm, Mr. Rosa. I can't keep calm. They're going to destroy everything. Is this the island that you built? Yes, like I said, I'm an engineer. Doctor, my ass! Piss off! ONE YEAR EARLIER Doctor, my ass! Piss off! Doctor, my ass! Piss off! If I may, we're already doctors. We've passed our exam, so now we're engineers not-- Engineer, my ass! Piss off! What the hell are you doing? Forfeit! What forfeit? I was just talking… It's not fair! Guys, he's right. If you challenge a professional-- -You stole my glass! -Forfeit! What? I was talking about the engineer thing. They insist. I'd say a fair forfeit could be… to have him… make a complete ass of himself! -But these aren't the rules… -Ass of himself! -I didn't lose! -Ass of himself! So, the first girl that walks in, he must chat her up, and when she least expects it, he kisses her on her lips! Shit! Hi. How's it going? It's good to see you. I'll be right there. -Yes. -Kiss! Well, it's… It's just that today we took our state exam. I'm now officially an engineer. -Congratulations! -Thanks. Guys, we can't do the kiss thing. We can't do that… They want me to kiss you, because I lost a drinking game. -Sure. -I didn't even lose. They're just insisting because… Guys. We can't do that. We just can't do that. Guys, it's not gonna happen. Right, there's no point that they keep saying… We just can't do that, you know… You look good. You look very good. Honestly. Thanks. Fancy a drink? Well, anyway… It's a funny coincidence running into each other here-- Not really. Bologna isn't a big town. Yeah, sure. Last time we saw each other, you were seeing that guy, that-- -Carlo. -Carlo, that's right. Carlo. He's not here, is he? We've been having problems lately. I'm sorry to hear that. No, you're not. Come on, it was clear that you were… Well, that your relationship was like… just a temporary one. How long have you been together? A few months? Three years. Three years? That's almost as long as we were. I guess your parents like him. -Why are you having problems? -My parents liked you. Your dad hated me. You didn't answer me. Well, maybe he hated you a bit, but… not much considering he nearly lost his sight when you blew up his TV during the Italy vs. Russia match. And you never apologized to me or him. It imploded, and you're still not answering. We fell out because after three years, he believes we should get married. -Imploded? -I knew there was something. Get married? Be careful about marriage. He's not the right man. How do you know if you don't know him? Now you're not answering. The cathode tube implodes, it doesn't explode. Electrons flow through the vacuum. And I told your father a thousand times to sit further away. I just wanted him to enjoy the football match. Those three lines-- Sorry, Giorgio. It's eleven o'clock… How can you watch a match with lines? -I have to go. I've got a class tomorrow. -Wait. I'll drive you home. Since when do you have a car? Excuse the interior. I built this car for the engineering exam. I thought it'd be interesting to make something practical. And I focused a bit more on the engine than the interior. To speed things up, I used my grandma's sofa as seats. She's dead now anyway. -Grandma Margherita is dead? -Yes, two months ago. -She couldn't take our breaking up. -We split up three years ago. Come on. Yes, it was a slow decline. She deteriorated slowly. -Giorgio… -Can you remind me why we split up? Because being with you is too risky. You have to take risks if you want to try and change the world. You're hardly changing the world getting rid of three lines on a TV. -It's beautiful, you know? -What is? -The car. -Thank you! It's weird, but… you built a car by yourself, and it works. It runs! It might not be Diabolik's Jaguar but-- Whose Jaguar did you say? Diabolik's. -Diabolik, The King of Terror. -Who's he? The new comic everyone's talking about! -Never heard of it, honestly. -It's great. Basically, it's about this very clever thief who always wears… who always wears a mask… -They want us. -Do they? Okay, let's pull over. Hello. Yes. -Good evening. -Evening. Is there a reason why this vehicle has no license plate? Because I didn't buy this vehicle. I actually built it. This car has no license plate? To be honest, I didn't think about that at all. All right, if you want to be funny, step outside, please. Driving license and registration. Salvatore, check their criminal records. And here we are. Let me explain. I built this car with my own hands, because I'm an engineer. So it's the same principle as with the license plate. I don't have a registration nor driving license-- You drove me around without a driving license? -I drove you. I didn't force you, did I? -Yes. -You insisted. -I insisted? I'd have never driven you around Bologna in a car with no plate, no driving license, half-drunk-- Did you say "drunk"? No, I'm not drunk. I lost a drinking game. Actually, I didn't lose-- Salvatore, so do these two have criminal records? I'm a lawyer, address us politely. We're not "these two," thanks. That's right. She's my lawyer. So let's keep calm. Giorgio, I'm not your lawyer. I'm an international law associate. Bummer. Bloody useless international law… Nothing on the lady. -But Rosa has a criminal record. -What about Rosa? That's not a criminal record, it's a flying ban. They're two totally different things. And as per the judge's order, I disassembled the biplane. I worked two summers to pay for those street lights. -Please… -You flew an unregistered plane? Yes, I did. What's with this fixation with registering everything? Shall we also put a plate on the bottom of each bird that's flying in Piazza Maggiore? Salvatore, his car's in the way. Move it, then call the tow truck. You don't need to. Salvatore, I can do it. You'll break it. You don't know how to start it. Stand back. This vehicle is being impounded. Impounded? You must be joking. Salvatore, wait! -Salvatore, stop. You'll break it! -Stand back. -Didn't you hear me? -You'll break it. -Listen! -I'm listening! -Stop! -Don't touch him. -He's touching everything. -Keep your hands down! There was no need for you to come. They didn't need to wake you up for that. I was handling it just fine. The judge was going to convict you because you're a repeat offender. They're different things. This one happened on the ground, the other one was air-related. Why don't you just try, Giorgio? -Try what? -To be normal. You'd be happier. Look at yourself now. What are you talking about? Listen to yourself, "Be normal"… I managed to meet Battistini and showed him the blueprints of your car. He was so impressed, he wants you on his team of engineers. Dad, don't show my stuff to people. It's private. It's a sought-after position. You should be glad. Yes, I know, Dad. Thanks. Could you please pull over? I want to get out. -Why don't you come home? -I want to get out. Just stop the car and let me out! Where are you going now? Called to answer charges for crimes against humanity, the Nazis appealed to the positive law, alluding to their famous phrase, "We were just following orders." In other words, "We were obeying the law," which, no matter how brutal, was still the law. To this avoidance of responsibility, the judges would respond by appealing to natural law. Natural law is that innate sense of justice which exists in each one of us reminding us that it's more important… Can you move over? …to prioritize what is right over the rules, what is right over the law. Because laws change, while what is right will always be right. And this, doesn't mean that obeying the law is not important, on the contrary, it's extremely important. Especially the driving laws, the traffic codes, even license plates are important. Right. That's it for today. I'll see you next week. Chapter three, The Tokyo Trial. Professor, the class only lasted ten minutes. Because these are complex concepts which take time to comprehend, especially for you, Nicolini, who's already failed three times. You're coming with me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know what these are? Blue fingertips? They took my fingerprints, Giorgio. -They already had mine. -My fingerprints! I'm applying for tenure in six months. I can't take the exam if I have a criminal record. The evening didn't end well, that's why I'm here, to apologize. Didn't end well? We were arrested! Okay, it ended badly then. A tragedy. But… what happened before that… can't be ignored. -Giorgio, you live in your own world. -Don't you like it? No, I don't, because it ends with getting arrested. Because you live in your own world, but this world isn't all yours! -You didn't build it like your car! -Then maybe I should. Should what? Build my own world. Giorgio, it was a metaphor. -Would you come? -You can't build a world! -Maybe I can-- -No, you can't! Because you're not a genius, even though you think you are! You build toys that keep getting you arrested. And for a second, I nearly forgot that. Goodbye, Giorgio. THREE MONTHS LATER One second 40. One second 40 on the fourth lap? -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. What shitty tires did we put on? Luca, we knew it was risky. That's not a risk. That's goddamn suicide! We must tell Bruno. Change the strategy, go flat-out, either it works or it doesn't. Flat-out from the fourth lap? Either that or we get there half an hour later! Hey, go to corner seven and show this to Bruno. What the hell are you waiting for? Hurry up! Go! -Who the hell is that? -He's the new guy. Battistini says he's a great engineer. He looks like a moron to me. OUR PLATFORMS, YOUR ENERGY, YOUR FREEDOM Sir, I swear we wouldn't even dream of going anywhere near your safe. Angelo, I understand, but this is the third time this year that money has gone missing and it's only February. Dad, don't worry about this. I'll deal with it. It's… impossible to describe the pain that you people, with your greed, have caused to this company, to this family, and to this righteous man. This man who welcomed you in your time of need. When you people, dressed only in desperation, arrived here from your remote and wild lands. And how did you repay him? By stealing from the hand that fed you. Mr. Maurizio, there's no proof it was us. Angelo. Angelo, how can you say something like that? In the safe, there were five bills of 50,000 lire. Now there are none, and the only Calabrians here… are you guys. Or am I wrong? They've got some nerve… They're the only ones here, right? I have to go now, because we have a company to run, even though… it'll be more challenging from today because of you guys. So we're building a platform. We're making an island. Okay, I get it, but in the shape of a platform. It's an island! Initially, I wanted to build a real one with sand and everything. And I spent months trying to find a way. But it's impossible, Maurizio. But then… I saw the solution. An island made of steel. -Steel! -Steel… Can you imagine? Our own island, where we can do what the hell we want. Where we can live by our own rules. So I won't have to work for my dad anymore? Of course not! Because I hate this shipyard. Do you understand? I hate smelling the stink of it every day. The stink of the grease of the ships, the gas, the Calabrians. Listen, do you think we can have a bar too? A bar where we can drink what the hell we want? Yes, of course. Well, I wouldn't make it the main attraction, but yes. -Where do you want to build this island? -This is the best part. Outside Italian territorial waters. Where nobody can bust our balls. And where is it? Is it far? Wherever we want. As long as it's six miles off the coast. I was thinking here, opposite Rimini. Perfect. Where do we start? We look at how they build platforms. So how do they do it? Pillars of 34 with reinforced concrete foundations on the bedrock. -How big are the foundations? -I don't know, they're big. -What do you mean? 90, 150? -I don't know. I didn't measure them! You go next time. Come on, help me up. Hurry, before someone calls security. Let's recap. One underwater concrete injector. Then what? About 30 pillars? Yes, about that. Say we build them as thin as 90. Then we need to hire ten skilled workers. And even if we hire Calabrians, no insurance, no payroll taxes, and we fire them with a random excuse in the last week and we pay them nothing, that's 100 million gone already. If we got rid of the concrete? We'd get down to 80, but the problem is transportation. To move 30 pillars of 90 for six miles, we'd need a cargo boat. If they were made of wood, we could float them there. It can't be made of wood, it has to be steel. I've been told steel doesn't float. Well… that ship's made of steel, and by some weird magic that I've never understood, it does float. So steel doesn't float, but hollow steel does. With hollow pillars, we solve the problem of transportation. I get it, but how can we build a platform on hollow, empty pillars? I never said empty. Once they're in the right spot, we open up one end, and what happens? It fills with water, and it sinks to the bottom. We'll build the island with filled pillars, but filled with water. I'll pay you back for the pillars. Don't worry. For 700,000, I won't go hungry. What, 700,000 lire? Where did you get all that money? I usually steal it from my father's safe. -Doesn't he notice? -Of course he does. It's 700,000 lire. I blame the Calabrians who work for him. He reports them, or he fires them. I'm not sure. I think this is it, here. Turn off the engine! Here we are. If my calculations are correct, from this point on, we are outside territorial waters. We're no longer in Italy, Maurizio. We're in international waters. No one's in charge here! Nobody can tell us what to do, what not to do, and stuff like that, Maurizio. We're free! Maurizio! Maurizio. Hey, Maurizio. Listen… now comes the tricky part. -I know. -We need to unplug the tubes. It's one thing doing it in a bathtub, and quite another on the open sea. Remember, lift up the slider, and get away as quickly as you can. -I got it. You told me a million times! -Because it's dangerous. Can't you smell the freedom? Not really, Maurizio. I can only smell some cheap herbal liquor. You're already drunk at 8 a.m.? Did you think I could do this sober? I can't believe this. By the way, it's peach grappa. I see. Come on. You go, man! Be careful! It's all in your hands now! All in your hands! Remember. Remember, move away immediately. Keep in mind all the steps. Open the slider and get out of the way! Move away immediately. Okay? Do you hear me, Maurizio? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Of course not. It's working! No, Maurizio! Why didn't you listen to me? I told you to move away immediately! He never listens! He has to do things his way! Look what's happened to him now! Now I'm stranded here on the boat, in the middle of the sea! Well done! It works! It works! It's the best day of my life! I want to do it again! Come on! So you two transported some pillars, installed them on the seabed, built a 400-square-meter platform and nobody said anything? That's correct. Not until we got the drill. The drill? Yes. To look for drinking water. To be an independent island, you need to have your own water. So we had to drill. Can't we turn this drill off? It's been three days. It's driving me mad! Maurizio, water is essential! If you're worried about the cost of the drill, we'll have to budget better, counting the workers and all that. Come on! We're not really going to pay them! They're actually grateful to us. They were this close to jail. They stole millions from my dad's safe! Wasn't that you? Not according to the prosecutor in Rimini. Right. What a pain. Turn it off for a second. And then we'll turn it back on. You can't just flip a switch. It's not a toaster. Coastguard to… unidentified island. You're required to identify yourselves, and to immediately cease all activities. No, we can't turn it off just like that. There's no switch! Last warning. The illegal occupation of public airwaves is a criminal offense punishable with immediate detention if in flagrante. -Public airways? -He doesn't get it. Let me talk to him. This is not… a toaster that you can switch on and off. And we're in international waters! And most importantly, we're not a radio. We're not. No! He thinks the drill is a transmitting antenna. We're not transmitting. We don't use airwaves. It's just a drill. We're looking for water. We're looking for water. Did he say they're looking for water? Did he understand? What do they mean? Why are you looking for water in the middle of the sea? Well, because… To create an independent state. An independent state with or without radio? Without radio! A state without radio. Perfect. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a nice day! You too. -More water? -I'm okay, thanks. Let's go and take the Calabrians back to shore. You know what? I think I might stay here. Here where? Here, on the island. We have everything. We have water, coffee. We have everything. And it's a beautiful, sunny day. I'll spend my first night here. Are you sure? Why did we build an island if we're not going to stay on it? I'm definitely sure. Anyway… it's beautiful! Shit. This is incredible. Thank you, Maurizio. Thank you. Listen, better not to hug in front of the Calabrians. Do you mind? Yes, sure. You're right. Sorry. Hey! Hey! What is that? This is a free and independent island! We even have drinking water-- Okay, you can tell me later! Help me up, please! Pietro Bernardini. Officially, a welder. He'd been living on his boat for months, and he became the first resident of the island. -Was the first resident really a castaway? -Yes. There appears to be another resident too. A stateless man of German origin whose name is… whose name is… Neumann. Wolfgang Rudy Neumann. Correct. Wolfgang Rudy Neumann. Legend has it that in 1943, Neumann was forced to join the army and was sent to Rimini to defend the Gothic Line. But as soon as he saw the beach, he knew what he wanted to do with his life. Without even thinking about it, one night he runs away from his camp and goes to the town hall to ask for a beach concession. This is how the legend of Wolfgang Rudy Neumann was born, the greatest promoter on the Romagna Riviera. Rudy! Come here! But at the end of the war, he was charged with desertion and his German citizenship was revoked. Yes, Peppe? Did I ever tell you what my father did for a living? -No, Peppe. You didn't. -He was a buffalo farmer. And guess what buffalo smells of? Cows? Shit. I went to the toilet earlier, and I was almost moved. It reminded me of my childhood. How many times do I have to tell you you need to check them every 20 minutes, and clean the shit off the floor, off the walls, off the sink, and off the toilet seats? Why do I have to do that? Who's bringing all these people who shit here? That's what I do, bring people to clubs. That's what you pay me for. No, I pay you because I'm a benefactor. If you don't like it, why don't you open your own beach club? You know why. They only give permits to Italian citizens. Open one in Germany then. I'm not a German citizen either. So, buddy, off you go then. Did you hear they're building an island off Rimini? They're building an island? Yeah, some crazy guy from Bologna. It's absurd. What do they plan to do with it? It's outside territorial waters, you can do what you want, apparently. I tell you what, we can party big time there. A round of applause to the best promoter on our Riviera, Rudy Neumann! -I mean, you built all this by yourselves? -Yes, we did. Why the hell did you do that? For the same reason a dog licks his own balls. I don't get it. Because he can. What do you mean? A dog licks his own balls because he can. We are engineers, we wanted to build an island, we could do it, so we did it. I don't get the balls thing, you lick your own balls-- No, we don't lick our balls. It was a way of saying we wanted to create our own world where we'd feel really free, and we did it. We built it. Is that a naked man shaving? Yes, his name is Pietro. He lives here. On the island? Yes, he's a castaway. He's not much of a talker but… I can only count three things here though. A semi-deserted island, water that's almost fresh, and a half-naked castaway. Not much of a free, new world. Wait a minute, I can count three things too. A German deserter, a promoter that nobody knows, and-- I can't even think of a third one. This guy comes in criticizing-- You don't do that. We don't have to welcome everyone. These are the people we should be welcoming. Castaways, deserters… Here no one really cares who you are or where you're from. He says this now, but he did all this for a girl. -No, I didn't. -Yes, you did. Does this place have a name? BOAT TRIP TO THE NEW STEEL ISLAND DEPARTS 10:30 EVERY MORNING RETURNS 17:45 With Rudy Neumann, everything changed. It was an incredible and instant success. Rumors about a free, independent state spread like wildfire. First along the Romagna Riviera, then all across Italy. In the end, people were arriving from all over Europe, to see for themselves what sounded like a miracle. And it also happened at the perfect time. That was a year that made history. And that everyone recalls just by the last two numbers, six and eight. We didn't know much about the French riots of that May. Except that they took to the streets and set Paris on fire, calling for a better world. As for us, we actually built that "better world" ourselves. Today, May 1st, 1968, five hundred meters outside territorial waters, free from everything, we're making history! Here, you are truly free! Welcome to Rose Island! We need a language. What do you mean? People come from all over Europe. We need an official language that's not Italian and not from another country. A free international language. I don't think it exists, unfortunately. I believe it does. ROSE ISLAND THE MYSTERY OF THE ISLAND REVEALED IN RIMINI THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IS ESPERANTO For the press, we were more important than national politics, than student riots, and even the Vietnam War. ROSE ISLAND RUDY NEUMANN TO BE THE NEW PROMOTER Shit. Are you leaving? Yes. I'm pregnant. Pregnant? What do you mean "pregnant"? Oh my God, how do I tell my mother? It's not yours, idiot. We only met last night. Here. -Pietro, did you only get Cynar? -People love Cynar. Okay, no doubt about that, but they might want something else too. Can you hurry up? I heard from the pier, they're expecting it to be packed today. -How's it going with the bar? -He only got Cynar. -I think people really love Cynar. -Maurizio? Weren't you meant to go shopping with him? I'm only marginally involved in this project. Please, don't start again with the name story. Yes, I will. Because it was a beautiful and elegant name. "Maurizio and Giorgio's island" wasn't beautiful nor elegant. Yes, it was. There's a girl staring at you. Oh, God. One of you must go and talk to her. -Tell her I died in Vietnam. -Hi. Hi! Nice to see you. What a surprise! I'm pregnant. I have a certificate of sterility issued during the war certifying that-- Look, I'm not sure it's yours. What do you mean? Well, there are several options. That's not nice. A girl shouldn't really go around saying-- I've heard this place is amazing but the bar sucks. I need a job. And it looks like you need a bar attendant. -Get up. -What? Come on, get up! It's getting worse by the minute here. The German's getting people to sign up for an end-of-summer water-ski race. Do you think that's normal? Was this the great idea we had? Because if you're talking of a free world, I have a different view. And what's that? A big poker tournament. -A gambling house? -No! We'll play for shots. Shots of grappa. If you lose, you drink, if you win, you drink, and if anyone wants to play with money, we can't say no. But that's not the point, just as long as we both agree. I'll stop him before he collects money off people. Let's talk about it later. Maurizio! Hey! That's the thing they do most often. They throw their clothes away, shirts, ties, everything. Not sure why, but many of them do that. Is that your girlfriend? Who? That one there, the bar attendant. Come on! She's pregnant. Is it yours? What? No! She doesn't know whose baby it is. She doesn't care. She said there were a few options. She symbolizes this place, a young, free-spirited, pregnant girl. She wouldn't have found a job on the mainland, but here… You know, I'm happy to see you. I knew you'd come sooner or later. -Everyone's talking about it in Rimini. -You should see this place at night. You'd love it. Are you staying tonight? I'm getting married soon, Giorgio. Married? Come on! You don't want to get married. You belong in this world more than anyone else. I'm not sure this qualifies as a world, Giorgio. It's more like a disco, a beach club. It's not a disco. It's an independent state. Free. We even have drinking water. -We have an official language. -Sure. But I see people dancing, drinking, a cute girl bartender, and it looks like a disco. That's all. With the name in Esperanto. It looks like that to you. Right. Giorgio, I'm sorry but… I have to go. Take care. Do you know how hard it is to bring all these people out here? No, and you know why? Because it isn't hard to bring people here! The hard part was building this island! And while we were building it, you were cleaning toilets. I was the promoter there, and I quit because two kids built a house on stilts in the sea and didn't know what to do with it. I turned it into a dream place! It was our dream, not yours! Don't forget that. I won't let you turn this place into an illegal gambling den. There's nothing illegal on this island. You need to understand that! Water-skiing is for rich people. You can do it anywhere. But poker's something you can only do here. -Because it's a crime in the real world! -Correct! But not here. That's why we built an island. -Giorgio, back me up here. -We built a disco. We did what? We built our little, free world, on our happy island… But what's all this for, if they don't recognize us as an independent state? Who's "they"? Italy, Europe, the other states. Who else? I disagree with that. Who cares if they recognize us or not? If we wanted a state, we'd have rules, and we don't want that. If they don't recognize us, we'll just be a disco in the middle of the sea. We already have everything. We have currency, we have stamps, we have a postal service. The only thing missing… is a government. But we are the government. I'll be the president. Franca, the minister for economic affairs. Pietro, surveillance and defense. What's a surveillance ministry? I said "surveillance and defense" for a reason. You're the caretaker, you oversee rather than defend. Rudy, secretary of state, Maurizio, internal affairs. -I'm not sure that's a good idea. -Maurizio's right. It'll piss them off. So what? I feel like a minister. I wonder how my folks will react. I usually give them bad news. How exactly are we doing this? UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS COUNCIL OF MINISTERS The idea is to increase and strategically relocate the military trucks in key spots to send out a strong message. Using the summertime to regain control over the occupied universities. Basically all of them, except one. Only one left? Which one? Luigi, the military trucks again? I know, Giovanni, but if you've noticed, the students who went to lessons and respected the teachers six months ago, have suddenly turned into a mob driven by hatred and violence. Clearly, pollution is to blame, excessive protein intake, and TV. I happened to watch TV last night, and it was all about dismemberment, monsters, people copulating. All this on the main channel. Is that acceptable? You must have watched The Odyssey. The Odyssey? Maybe. I fell asleep halfway through. Okay, then… let's go ahead with the outposts. If there are no other urgent matters, we'll update on Thursday. Thank you. Actually, Giovanni, talking about young people, there is one thing… Forget it, we'll talk about it next time. Don't worry. Tell me, Franco. We'll talk about it next time. Don't worry, it's not important. Even better. Just tell us and we can go for lunch. It's nothing… Basically, what's happening is… there's this guy, with some friends in Rimini. It's nothing really… Five hundred meters outside of territorial waters, so just off Rimini. What did he do? He built an island, and declared independence. I didn't get that. Say it again. It's nothing, Giovanni, it's no big deal. I told you. In fact, while telling you and hearing myself saying it, I actually realized that it sounds more serious than it really is. Some guys in Rimini, 500 meters outside territorial waters, built an island and declared independence. Independence from whom? From Italy, I believe. From everyone. They're independent… An island, though from what I gather, it's more like a platform. "From what I gather"? Giovanni, please, let's not make a drama out of nothing. -And how did they build this platform? -I don't know. -And how long did it take? -Giovanni-- -How long did it take? -I don't know. An adequate amount of time necessary to build something like that. Why are we just finding out about it? Maybe because the local authority, considering it's outside territorial waters, might have believed it wasn't their-- I'm sorry, but how did you find out? Well… this maybe is the only detail that makes this seemingly insignificant event, a little more serious because basically, we were told by… Well, the UN called us. -The UN called us? -That's why I didn't want to tell you. Giovanni, we're making a big fuss, that's what we're doing, about a prank-- I'm sorry, Franco, the UN called us, and you say it's a prank! Who's our man at the UN? Who's there? Randelli. Randelli died last year! What's the name of the officer who called you? I don't think it was an officer, Giovanni. Good. Maybe it was a secretary. Secretary, yes, I mean… not a secretary but the… Secretary-General of the United Nations. When did this happen? Two days ago. What the hell have you been doing for two days? I immediately sent out two of our best intelligence officers. Good. Where's their report? We haven't heard from them… for nearly 40 hours. By law, in eight hours' time we have to notify the families by telegram. Good morning, gentlemen. So… -Tell me you found them. -They're on the phone. -They're alive then. -Yes, I'd say so. They'll regret they are. Agent, I hope you have a valid explanation for your disgraceful behavior. -I cheated on my wife! -Agent, pull yourself together. The situation's taken a bad turn. Please, don't tell her. I love her so much! -Wait! -Minister, Agent Piazza here. The island's inhabitants' top priority is the custom of adding fruit to wine, then drinking the wine… Agent Piazza, it's called sangria. In Spain, they've been doing it for ages. Agent Piazza, I'm fairly sure that you're talking to an Italian minister while drunk! It's the minister. Return to Rome immediately with a detailed report. Or you will have to face a court-martial with accusations of high treason. After foreign affairs, onto lifestyle. Or rather, we're still on foreign affairs but we'll focus on the "life in style." That fun play on words is the perfect introduction to what seems to have become the main attraction on Rimini's shores, Rose Island. The founder, Giorgio Rosa, talks about utopia and freedom. But what is being hidden on the island? Drugs? Moral degeneration? Gambling? We talk to Franco Restivo, Minister of Internal Affairs. This so-called Rose Island, absolutely cannot and should not be considered as an independent state. Is it true that the UN has started an investigation on the basis that there might be grounds for a claim for independence? No. That investigation does not concern us. The Italian State will absolutely not tolerate a lawless platform where the safety of our citizens cannot be guaranteed. They may be in international waters, but they are Italian citizens, and their safety is our main concern. What's this? Letters. Applications for citizenship. The minister has unwillingly put us on the map. The requests come from all over the world! Now everyone knows who we are. And they want to become citizens of Rose Island. -God bless the president! -Come on, get up. -You're amazing! -Thanks. So how's it going? Sorry I'm late. President? Yes, Dad, but they're hippies. They're over the top. -Have you ordered yet? -We were waiting for you. Okay, here I am. Waiter! What's fresh today? Our usual catch of the day, and a fantastic lobster that can be served a number of ways. Great! Lobster for everybody? Half a portion of tagliolini. Half a portion of tagliolini? Dad? Yes, half a portion of tagliolini. Don't worry about money, you're my guests. -Half a portion-- -He'd like half a portion of tagliolini. So two lobsters and half a portion of tagliolini. Good. Thank you. -Thanks. You look good, Mom. -Thanks. Is it legal, Giorgio? The money you're earning, is it legal? What do you mean legal? We're an independent state, close to being recognized by the UN, we get to decide what is legal. Nobody gets to say what is legal for themselves. Dad, we're doing nothing wrong. Don't believe the newspapers. Why don't you come after lunch? It's just 20 minutes by boat. We can go together, and you can see what we do. Did I tell you I patented a telescopic pillar system to build it? You'd love it. Are you coming? Your mom has a nap after lunch, we'd better not. Okay. Maybe another time. Aren't your folks coming? My mom needs a rest after lunch. Don't take it personally. It's hard for them to understand what we're doing. Mr. Rosa, right? We're about to leave. We're in a hurry. Yes, that's me. You need to talk to our foreign relations representative. Mr. Rosa, we need to talk to you. -I was just saying that you need to-- -That's okay. Let's go. Meet me at the boat. I'll be right back. Mr. Rosa, do you know who we are? -Funeral service? -We're from the Secret Service. I know. It was a joke. Haven't we met before? I've spent about 40 hours on the island. I remember, you're the one who lost his pinkie. Not really. I didn't actually bet my pinkie. It was a memorable game! You must immediately cease all activities on the island. Which activities? Our report suggests that you have a bar managed by a minor, and you host card games. So what? Aren't those men playing cards in a bar too? Why can't we do it? It's different what happens here under the watchful eye of the authorities. Oh, I see! It's about "the watchful eye." Listen, Giorgio, what the major is trying to say is that we appreciate your sociological experiment, but as with all experiments, it must end now. What must end? Beach clubs permits are being renewed at the end of the month. And the major here has power of attorney. See this briefcase? It contains papers which guarantee that you, who's sitting here owning nothing, end up with two beach clubs of your choice. It'd set you up for the next three generations. You said it yourself, you do the same things there, bar, card games… You just do it here and not on the sea. What's the difference? None, except for the permits we'll give you. You might say, "I don't pay goddamn taxes there." Do you think anyone does here? Come on, Giorgio. What the hell… This is serious, you know! I'm trying to save your goddamn island! Attention, please, everyone. Mr. President, may I say it? As you wish. Okay. As you know, tonight, we kept the island to ourselves for a special Council of Ministers, as special as the news I'm about to give you. Our President, Giorgio Rosa, has finally agreed, that from tomorrow the island will officially be able to grant citizenship to all applicants. What are you clapping for? That wasn't the news. Stop! That wasn't the news, just an official communication. The real news is that we have printed the first passport, and we have agreed to assign it to the one among us who has never owned one. So… Rudy, this is for you. Now, this calls for a round of applause. Come on, guys! -Well done, Neumann! -GIve me a hug. We're hoping that with the increased military presence, things will settle. We're hoping to regain control of the universities, since there's only one left. I know. These are hard times. But you shouldn't worry, you're doing a great job, and we're all very happy here. Thank you, Emanuele. Well, Giovanni, I'll see you again in two weeks, as usual. -Sure. -Try to rest a little. You're looking a little gray. I could really do with a vacation. Don't forget this. Excuse me, Giovanni, since you're here, there's something I'd like to mention. Especially considering the exposure that it's getting in the tabloids. ROSE ISLAND A SMALL STATE OFF RIMINI Look, Emanuele, we're working on it. I'm sure you are, but times have changed. I used to be able to filter the news, but now our Holy Father wants to be informed first-hand. He reads all the papers first thing in the morning. I caught this one and removed it from the stack, but had he seen this, it would've gotten ugly. Giovanni, this is a bare ass. Do you get it, Giovanni, an ass in the newspaper. You tell me if you think this is okay. Of course not, but my dear Emanuele, we don't really want to start a case about an ass. It's not about the ass itself, which I think is well-proportioned, nice, but what the ass represents. An ass on an island where, from what I gather, you can do what you want. Do you get it, Giovanni? An ass and everything you want. Giovanni, with an ass, can you do anything you want? No. I'll tell you. You can't. Otherwise, this country would be out of our control. Sure. The truth is, they're outside our territorial waters. -So outside of our jurisdiction. -Like I said, it's just a small issue. Where's Franco? What the hell are these? My dear Giovanni, I wasn't expecting you. Had you told me, we could have met at the cafe. It's so messy here. -What the hell are these letters? -Nothing… Requests to relinquish Italian nationality, Mr. President, in favor of Rose Island. No, not really. I mean, it doesn't work like that. They can't just write in and we cancel their citizenship. It's not a subscription to Famiglia Cristiana that you just cancel. And most of the letters are written in such poor Italian! -Don't waste-- -How many are there? About 300. The German Consulate called, and they've received about 100, France 30, and the US four. Just four in the States, Giovanni. They don't give a damn about them. They flopped over there. Franco, I've had enough of this shit. The letters, parliamentary interrogations, asses that can't do what they want. -Asses what? -You have to fix this now. Even if you have to swim there with a screwdriver between your teeth to unscrew that goddamn platform bit by bit! Franco, we've known each other for 30 years, but you've never seen me truly pissed off. Tell me you understand. I understand, Giovanni. I do. Rosa! Rosa! It's Battistini. He wants to talk to you. Nothing. It's going to rain tomorrow too. We have to start building the roof for the second floor as soon as we can. And then we have to extend the canopy. Giorgio, are you listening? Did you think about heating? It's important. We'll freeze to death in a month. We have to find a solution. Rudy… What do you think? Well… I don't know, guys. An island is a summer place. In my experience, it's hard to attract guests in the autumn. What do you mean it's hard? This is an independent state. We can't shut down for the season. We have citizens now. What about you, Franca? What do you think? I'm almost six months pregnant. I don't know how much longer I can stay. We've been talking about our first natural-born citizen for months! The midwife said she won't come. She says it's too dangerous. She can't be bothered, more like. -Don't worry. I'll find someone else. -You, Pietro? What are your plans? Come on, what kind of plans can Pietro have? Come on, guys. Let's try to be a bit positive. Being negative doesn't help. What did they offer you? So the roof-- What did you say? What did they offer you? Wait a minute, am I the only one who wasn't offered anything? -Enough, Maurizio. -What do you mean "Enough, Maurizio"? You knew about this and didn't tell me? What did they offer you? You're using the baby excuse, but what did they offer you? You even had the guts to make up excuses. What were you offered? -Hi, Mom. -Hi. I've never watched daytime TV. I'm sorry, Dad. It's my fault. I didn't think they'd go this far. What did they offer you? Two beach clubs… of my choosing. Two beach clubs. We made all those sacrifices to pay for your education… and now you're going to be a beach club manager. There's always a time when you have to say yes. Isn't there? That's what you say. They said my performance was below the standard expected by the company. I've never taken an extra day off, and I haven't called in sick in five years. I've always done what I was asked to do. Say no, Giorgio. Say no this time too. Excuse me. I'm really sorry. Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Could you move over? Could you move over? It's urgent. I have to… Sorry. I'm really sorry. Thank you. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Thank you. What are you doing here? I've been looking for you. Where were you? Do you know Carlo, the man I'm about to marry? Carlo! Nice to meet you. I'm Giorgio. Gabriella's told me all about you. Carlo. Nice to meet you. -What's up, sweetheart? -Nothing, don't worry. Listen, it's not a disco. It's not a disco at all. It's a real state, a free one. So real that they're now attacking us. So now you have to fight my case. Okay. Sorry, honey. I'll be right back. Let's go. -I'm sorry, it's an urgent matter. -Excuse us, please. Sorry. You shouldn't have written to the UN. You pissed them off. I wanted to prove that we are a free and independent state. Yes, you're free geographically, but an Italian citizen remains so even outside territorial waters. Not if they choose otherwise. That's why we started issuing passports. That's exactly the point. You could be right but they'd never admit it as it could set a dangerous precedent. So? Who can help me? I don't know, maybe a priest. Come on! There must be someone, a judge, an agency, I don't know. A bloody King Solomon who deals with cases like these! The Council of Europe in Strasbourg handles disputes between states. Perfect, let's go then. Where? To Strasbourg! Giorgio, private citizens cannot go to the Council of Europe. But I have a state, and I'm going with my lawyer, you. International law is your field. I'm offering you the adventure of a lifetime. To save an independent state. Will you come? Giorgio… Fine. IMPOUNDED VEHICLE And so… I ended up here. "And so I ended up here." Is that all? Yes. Thank you. Major, accept my congratulations on behalf of the Italian people. It wasn't an easy task. Thank you, Minister. How much did it cost us? They're four poor souls, sir. We got away with a bar, one club permit, one passport, and a sailing boat. And what about what's his name, Orlandi? Maurizio Orlandi. He's an alcoholic. All he does is drink. It's pointless talking to people like him. Well done, Major. Why are you whispering? To avoid bothering you, sir. Whispering bothers me. What did you tell him? Nothing important, Minister. No… I don't like the face you pulled. What did he tell you? Giorgio Rosa… is at the Council of Europe. It doesn't mean anything, sir. He's just sightseeing. They don't see private citizens. The Council of Europe decided to see him after he spent a week in the lobby. They called an emergency meeting, and Giorgio Rosa gave his version. Fine. It's incredible. I don't know how you did it. You told an incredible story. Whatever the outcome, this will go down in history. You have no idea what is about to happen here today. Translate. They will start a dossier on it, and they will review the case. Go on. Basically, the Council of Europe will deliberate on your island. It went well? Can someone please answer the phone? So, Giorgio, you should not let your guard down. Maybe we should talk to some legal experts. Can someone answer the phone? Hello? Yes. Mr. Tomà. It's urgent. Not now, get a message. I'll call back. No… It's the Italian Minister of Internal Affairs. It's not for you. He wants to talk to Mr. Rosa. Hello? When I was a boy, I had one passion: cycling. I was able to perfectly combine my political activity with some decent results in some local cycling competitions. Then suddenly, I had to quit. In 1947, I quit cycling for good, because… every God-given day, myself and some 551 poor idiots, had to write a list of numbered sentences, which would become the foundation of this republic which was about to be born. You have to think of everything, you know. Consider all variables. If you get one wrong, it all falls apart, and the freedom we had fought so hard for, will vanish. Reading those little sentences today, I believe we got our odds right. And you, you insignificant piece of shit, would like to be the exception to that perfect calculation? You talk about freedom, but yours is a conditional freedom. Absolute freedom simply scares you. You don't hate me for what I've done, but for what I could do. I'm outside territorial waters. It doesn't concern you. You act like a big man, but then you write to the UN, and you go to the Council of Europe. I'd say you're not really an anarchist if you need someone to acknowledge you. You've built a 400-square-meter-platform with four idiots and you think that's a state? But you haven't got the slightest idea of what it takes to secure the freedom of 40 million people. I won't take lessons from someone who had a man fired after 30 years just to intimidate me! Do yourself a favor, get away from there. Save yourself the humiliation. You're on your own, and you haven't a hope. The Council of Europe has just agreed to examine my case, and the consultations start tomorrow morning. Stock up with lawyers, asshole, because this story has just started. And you can't stop me. All right, dickhead. You founded a state? So did I. But do you know the difference between our two states? I have an arsenal that can blow up your shitty island to pieces! Run back to Rimini quickly, or you'll miss the best fireworks you'll ever see! I have to go back to Rimini. The Council will meet in two days. There might not be an island in two days! Assault squad ready in 15 minutes. Instructions to follow. This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. Assault squad ready in 15 minutes. This is not a drill. Let's be honest, today's modern weddings always end with a gift of "The Hunter" to the guests. The one you're holding is the crown jewel of the '68-'69 collection, "The Hunter and his Bloodhounds." We also have the basic version without the bloodhounds. Sure, it'll save you some money, but it's less elegant and symbolic. What shall we do, sweetheart? What's this? It's a replica of Rose Island in silver. Just a souvenir, we sell lots of them to tourists. If you like it, we also have it in wrought iron. Hello, Mom? Were you sleeping? Yes, sure. It's 11 p.m. I'm sorry. No, nothing. It was just to tell you I'm fine. I'm on the freeway. I'm coming back to Rimini. I've been to France. Do you remember? For the island issue. It's actually going really well. Tomorrow they're going to meet to deci-- Yes, Mom. I ate. Yes, I had a sandwich at the gas station. Yes, they make sandwiches. They stuff them with things. I'm fine, Mom. I… just wanted to say hi. No, don't wake him up. It's fine. Give him my love. Bye, Mom. Goodnight. Can it fit two people? I mean the boat. Can it fit two people? "Boat"… This one here? Yes, sure… It was just my way of saying I'm coming with you. With me? Okay. I called Strasbourg. They said there was a problem. Your mom said you were heading back. I thought you'd be here. Can you hurry? -I see… I couldn't understa-- -Can you hurry up? -Sorry, but-- -No. Clearly, I'm not getting married. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. But please, don't make me regret it. It's strange seeing it so empty. And yet they hate it, even if it's empty. What do you think they'll do? I don't know, Giorgio. Something to prove their point, a symbolic act, you know. Thanks for being here with me. You know, now it doesn't… look like a… like a disco. Finally, you admit it! It took a long time! Is it true what they say? What do they say? That you did all this for me. That I did all this for you? If we really want to go back to the genesis of the idea, it's a type of concept, a search for absolute freedom. So it's always-- So much for a symbolic act. An honor to have you, Admiral. The ships are in position. Civilians on the island? Two. Giorgio Rosa and an unidentified girl. Perfect. We'll wait for Rome to green-light the attack. Let's get moving. Load the cannons. I want to be home for dinner. Here's the bar. As you can see, it's already equipped. This year the licenses are on hold, but you could turn it into a restaurant in the future. Now, if you can sign here, so I can get back to City Hall. It's so busy today. You'll have to tell me how you got the permit so quickly. It's been on hold for years. What's going on today? They say they're blowing up Rose Island. If you could please sign now. I need to leave. Good morning, everyone, here we are. The showdown between the Italian government and what is known as Rose Island… It seems we're back to the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Will Italy have its own Bay of Pigs? We're in front of Rose Island… Come in. "Seaside government." We worked 20 hours a day, including Sundays, and here, it looks like we were lying on a beach sunbathing and eating spaghetti with clams. What can I say, Giovanni? We always complain this is a country with a short memory. At least this time it's in our favor. Look, I just need a quick signature. Is this a joke? Sorry, but I'm the one who invented the end-of-term prank. I'll even tell you when. Four years ago, when Aldo resigned. We brought him a declaration of war on Albania. You should've seen his face. We had a blast. Giulio cried with laughter. Who are we bombing this time? Rose Island, Giovanni. It must be destroyed. And how are you planning to do that? With surface-to-air missiles? I gave orders to arm the Andrea Doria. I just need your signature for the attack. You deployed a battleship from Venice? Are you crazy? Giovanni, you told me to fix the issue by any means necessary. I asked you to solve a problem, not to bomb the island. And to be honest, do you know what the best thing about an outgoing government is? That it's no longer our problem. After all, it's just an island, a summer place. If they open again in June, it'll be the next government's problem. Who cares? Giorgio Rosa appealed to the European Council. And they agreed to look into his case. Do you know what that means? If they accept his appeal, the island will be a fully-fledged state, just steps away from the communists. And am I supposed to sign an act of war? Giovanni, we are the only ones left who can do something about this. Trust me. Warships are surrounding the island. Nothing gets past you. We have to do something. Besides drinking, you mean? We have to go and defend it. Sorry to disappoint you, but they won't let the Laura Madre pass. Not the Laura Madre, no, but all the others… maybe. Operations, something's fast approaching, 36 degrees east. What do you mean "something"? I don't know, lots of small things, like a little fleet. Water-skiing. It's a water-skiing competition. -During a military operation? -Authorized by the port authority. I don't bloody care! Stop them immediately! They all paid the entry fee months ago. The port authority won't accept liability or refund them. Fine. Fine. Tell them we're turning now! Neumann, we're turning! Rome has authorized the attack, sir. Perfect. Call the admiral, come on. Sir, we have another problem. I told you the water-skiing competition was a good idea. I'm sorry, my friend. Really. Nice to meet you. I'm Neumann. Nice to meet you. Gabriella. I'm the organizer of this competition that helped avoid a military occupation. Next time, we'll organize it for the end of August. It's freezing now! If there is a next time. Neumann's here now! Let me talk to them. I've been through war before. Sorry, I need to put some clothes on. So, our objective today, is to wipe out that pile of junk-- Admiral, we have a problem. The civilians on the island have multiplied. What do you mean "multiplied"? They're not bloody bacteria! They used the water-ski competition as a cover to get on the island. Mr. Carrisi, you're very lucky to be this young. You know what they did to people like you on the hellish routes to Benghazi? I'm sorry, sir. Aim the cannons, and fire two warning shots. They're just spineless kids. They'll run away as soon as they smell the gunpowder. Yes, sir. What do we do now? What do you say, Rudy? God knows. "God knows"? You always go on about how you've been to war. I didn't think they'd aim the cannons. They're only trying to scare us. I'm not buying it. Soldiers… they're all the same. They act threatening, but they don't have the balls to shoo-- Admiral, the civilians are still there, holding hands. They're challenging us, sir. Shoot closer. Admiral, I'd advise against it. It's too risky. Shoot closer. Well, I guess I was wrong. We should go now. At least we tried. I'm not moving. Rudy's right. They're firing cannons. Staying here is suicide. Think of the baby. What do you mean? What about the "first natural-born citizen"? You're still going on about that? It was bullshit, a joke! Giorgio, listen, I know how soldiers-- It was good knowing you, Rudy. Send in the Raiders. Listen… about your dad's TV that time, I'm sorry. I never apologized. It's okay. Who cares. The important thing's to change the world. Or at least try to. The Council of Europe declared it couldn't deliberate on the dispute between the Italian State and the free Republic of Rose Island as the island was outside European territorial waters, essentially acknowledging it as an independent state. To prevent similar events from happening again, the UN moved the borders of international waters from 6 to 12 nautical miles, all around the world. To this day, the destruction of Rose Island is the one and only invasion perpetrated by the Italian Republic. Giorgio and Gabriella spent the rest of their lives together.
