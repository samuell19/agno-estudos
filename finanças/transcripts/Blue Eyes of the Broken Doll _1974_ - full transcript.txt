Subtitles ripped by: BlueDemon If you want more Hispanic and Latin American cinema, come and visit us. Hop in on the back. But I can only take you to the next village. Thanks. This is a bad time to find a job. The crops have been harvested already. Go North. You might find work there. Well, here we are. Thanks, pal! So long. See you later. What will you have? A cheese sandwich. - And to drink? - Some wine. Ma'am? Do you know where I could find a job around here? A job? No. I don't think so. Six francs. Why didn't you tell him to go to the house on the hill? The sisters need somebody to help them. I sort of liked this one. If they need a man, let them find one themselves. Caroline, one of these days I'm going to lock you up. You have an evil mouth. I don't know... I think I've seen that face before. Good evening. Get in. Perhaps I could interest you in something. I live with my two sisters a couple of kilometers from Perrouze, in an old broken-down house. Everything's in disarray. Nicole and I can't take care of it all. My other sister is in a wheelchair. We need a man to take care of the gardens, as well as the house. We'll pay you well. It's a deal. Let's try it. - What was that? - I don't know. Let's see. Why? Why did you do it? It was hurt and suffering. It's better that way. Hello. Good evening. Who's this guy? I've hired him to take Jears job. This is my little sister. I hope you're happy here. Until my sister fires you, like she's done with the others. Come with me, please. Claude? Is that you? How are you feeling today? Bad. Very bad. I'm always alone. You both have abandoned me. I was in Algiers. The nurse that the doctor recommended will be here tomorrow. - Who's that man? - His name is Gilles. He'll work here. You know we need help. Come in. You can put that down there. Now you know my whole family. It's a pity about your sister. She's very pretty. Listen. I warn you, stay away from my sisters. And also away from you. What happened to her? Was she sick or something? It was an accident. What about your hand? - Was that an accident, too? - It's not a pleasant subject. I don't like to talk about it. Are you embarrassed? Do you think I can be happy with this? It's simply repugnant! Disgusting! I don't think so. - This will be your room. Good night. - Good night. - What are you doing here? - Leave me alone. Good morning. Good morning. Your name is Gilles. Right? Yes. Did you want something? No. Nothing special. May I help you, Gilles? No, thanks. I'm done. You're making progress. No need to continue taking the pills. Good morning. How is she, doctor? Very well. I've stopped the sedatives. But she can't forget to take the vitamins. I won't be back until Wednesday. Good-bye, doctor, and thank you. Good-bye. - I'll walk you out. - Thank you. - Would you like something to drink? - Yes. The usual. I'll have some of that raspberry liqueur you make. - Did you talk to the nurse? - Yes. She said she'd be here today. I've known her for years. She's very competent, and she'll be a great help for your sister. Next week, I'll start a new treatment. I believe adequate psychotherapy can have good results. Doctor, I think it's all useless. I don't think she'll ever walk again. In my opinion, your sister's condition is more psychosomatic than functional. I don't want to bring false hope, but psychiatry opens new horizons every day. It offers new solutions every time. Do you do hypnosis as well? You have to be up-to-date, dear. When will you change this prosthetic? The new implants are almost perfect. It's not necessary. I'm fine like this. Your dedication to your sisters is admirable, but it is not necessary to close all doors to life. In some circumstances, It's not won'th it to be alive. You're very strong. I won't see you again until the day after tomorrow. It's getting late. I still have some errands to run. - So long, doctor. - So long, Nicole. Good morning. Please, I'm looking for Miss Claude. Yes. That's me. I'm Michelle Bott?, the new nurse. How come Miss Effrein didn't come? Are you Dr. Laboud? Yes, I am. Margot game me this letter for you. Very well, miss. Come to my office this afternoon. I'll give you instructions for the treatment to follow. Come with me. I was walking around the garden, and I saw your light on. I have insomnia. I can't sleep either. - I don't want any more junk! - You must drink it. Doctor's orders. - What did you put in it? - Nothing. Drink it all. You'll see how well you sleep tonight. Leave it like that, I'm comfortable that way. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Yes. Yes, don't worry. I'll be there in a few days. Tell him to be patient. Yes, he'll have it. Good-bye. I'll talk to you soon. My sisters are very miserable. No man would look at them. One's paralyzed, and the other has that disgusting hand. Well, I like them both. Even though Ivette is paralyzed, she's very good-looking. And as for Claude, she's a fantastic woman, in spite of everything. They're witches, and they have isolated me. They are keeping me away from everything! But I'm young. There's nothing wrong with me. You're just like me... a wretched failure looking for love in order to feel important. But we're nothing. Absolutely nothing. Good morning. Here's the wood. I said good morning. I told you to keep away from my sister. She is the one who came to me. It was very nice. You disgust me. Every man does the same. They follow her like dogs. Jealous? I'm not like my sister. Are you going to fire me? She mistreats me. She bothers me all the time. She won't let me do anything. Be patient, Ivette. I know it's difficult, but you must follow the treatment to the end. She's only following my orders. She's putting something in my milk. Don't worry. I'll talk to her. - Come with me, please. - Sure. She shouldn't notice when you give her the sedative. She hates medications. - Don't worry, doctor. - Thank you. - Good day, doctor. - Good day. Do you know Gilles? He works here. My pleasure. Gilles, did you finish your work? No. I'll get right on it. Nicole, come in. - What do you want? - What do I want? This! Michelle! Look! - What happened? - Some guy attacked me. But I made him go away. I sliced him good! Something to clean him up. Michelle, shall we call the doctor? No. Fortunately, the wound is not serious. Besides, the doctor is out of town. Well, I think you should go to your room and rest. Nicole, you stay here. I'll call the police. All this has to be picked up. It's getting late. I'll miss the train. - Very well. - Bye. I'm sorry I'm late. I've had an urgent matter. Tell me everything that happened. Gilles was attacked while he was working. He was wounded. - Is it serious? - No. He has a stab wound on the side, but it's not serious. For eight years, nothing has happened in the area. And suddenly, today, a man is attacked and a woman is killed in the road. Did anyone see anything? My sister saw it from the window in her room. She says it was Jean, our previous employee. Knowing Jean, I'm not surprised. He probably hates that man because he replaced him. There's no doubt. What I wouldn't give for the other case to be so clear. Was she stabbed also? No. She was strangled. I don't think the cases are related, if that's what you're thinking. - She was a nurse. - What was her name? Her name was Margot Effrein. Margot Effrein? I spoke to her a few days ago. She was coming to work here. Michelle replaced her. Very interesting. I'll have to talk to Michelle. Come in. - How are you? - Fine. This won't kill me. The name of the man who attacked you is Jean. - You knew him? - He worked here. He had problems with Nicole, so we fired him. We knew he was snooping around, but we didn't think he was dangerous. It's a miracle he didn't kill me. He must hate me because I took his place. I've filed a police report. They'll catch him soon. Well, I suppose you must want to leave after this. I'm not easily intimidated. I'm too strong. I'll be extra careful from now on, in case he returns. Although he had his share. You no longer seem to have a fever. Why did you do that? Because I like you. That's not true. No one can like me. I can only be disgusting. Doctor, the officer interrogated me about Margot's death. He asked me some questions as well. It's a pity! She was a great nurse and a wonderful person. I met her some years ago. I don't know who could have done such a thing. I hope they catch him. I'm worried about the things that go on in this house. What do you mean? I don't know, Ivette and the others, they're not normal. I feel uncomfortable. Michelle, sometimes our work is difficult. These three women are frustrated individuals. To some degree, they all suffer some sort of neurosis. Only Claude has some balance, and she sacrifices everything for her sisters' sakes. Yes, she's a bit dry, but she's the only one for whom I feel something. I don't know a lot about their parents, but it seems that their mother died insane, and the father committed suicide, overtaken by some sickly melancholy. I think there's some relation between the loss of Claude's hand and Ivette's paralysis. - Is that true? - Yes, I think so. But I don't know that for sure, either. They hate talking about the accident. On the other hand, Ivette's fianc? jilted her right after the accident and married her best friend. Alas, I'll do everything I can. Thanks, Michelle. Where's Claude? She went to town with Nicole. I need help. Could you give me hand? Sure. Why not? - What should I do? - Come closer. - I've been watching you for a while. - What do you want from me? Don't pretend. We know each other. I know what you do in Algiers. What does it matter to you? You don't have to go anywhere to find a man. You've got one right here. Nicole! What are you doing here? I came to town with Claude. I haven't been well lately. Why didn't you tell me this morning when I was at your house? I preferred to see you alone. You wouldn't be...? No, it's not that, doctor. My back hurts a lot. Here, up here. But that's not necessary. - Tell me what's wrong. - Look, right here. Come on, Nicole! Go on, get dressed. I'm too old for... If you don't leave right now, I'll tell your sister. You probably prefer that goody two-shoes. That girl was my daughter. And she died a long time ago. - I'm leaving. It's late. - Whatever you want. Now I'll have to cut across the old cemetery. Be careful, you might run into a ghost. Don't be stupid. I'll go singing. That way I won't be afraid. Here's the autopsy report. It's brutal! It wasn't enough to kill her. He also gouged out her eyes. The killer is unusually strong. She was stabbed all the way through with one blow. I've never seen anything like this in my life. It makes me sick. Pierre, do you think that there's any relation between the murder of the nurse, the attack on Gilles, and this? I don't know yet. I'd like to solve this before the criminal brigade gets involved. Go snoop somewhere else. I think you're overly interested in this case. Three Cokes. Yes, cutie. All right. I know who's to blame for all this. If they'd only let me... Doctor, you must come with me. Ivette's very sick. What's wrong with her? I laugh at the protection we have in this town. Us decent women can no longer go out by ourselves. Stay still! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Come on! Come on. Please leave the room. I'll try to calm her down. Michelle, please, you, too. Leave, please. Easy, Ivette. Calm down. You'll be fine in a minute. She's calmer now. She's sleeping. You may go rest. You must be tired. - I'll stay with her tonight. - Thank you. Call me if you need me. Good night. Good night. Veronique, take it to the kitchen before it coagulates. Hurry up. You are doing very well. We'll still have some difficulties until you are completely well. But we'll get over them. Thanks, doctor. You're very kind to me, and I'm grateful for that. Oh, it's nothing. Wow! It's really late. I must leave now. Gastors wife is about to go into labor. Good morning, doctor. Good morning. Michelle, you have a phone call. It's a man. Hello? No, it's impossible. Good morning, Claude. Is the doctor here? Yes. Come in. He's in there. Yes. Very well. Good-bye. - Good morning, Pierre. - Good morning, doctor. We need you at the morgue. There's been another murder. What? I'm sorry. I have a problem. I must leave for Algiers urgently. Pierre. I'm suspicious of Gilles. The crimes began when he arrived. Michelle, the nurse, is in the same spot. She even knew the first victim. But the assassin seems to be someone else. Who? A farmer saw him leaving the old cemetery. He believes he recognized Jean, the sisters' former employee. I wouldn't be surprised. He was always violent. And he recently attacked Gilles. He might be the killer. Do you think he'll try something against Ivette and her sisters? He hates them and he might return. I don't think he'll be back. They have Gilles. He's some sort of protection I'm not too sure about that, either. What are you doing? Give me that! Your picture's in this paper. "Alain Dupreil, rapist, sentenced to 10 years in prison. "He almost strangled Monique. The defense of his good attorney spared him from a much harsher sentence." Gilles! Since then, that memory haunts me. Every time I hug a woman, I feel the desire to kill her. Everyone sees a murderer in me... a beast! The life of an ex-con is very difficult. That's why I changed my name, and I'm constantly running. Gilles, I love you. I just want you to stay here. I have found true happiness next to you. Jean will not escape. We have him surrounded. There's something, though. Perhaps it's only a coincidence. But it makes me curious. The murdered giris all were blond and had blue eyes. How did you find out? The bodies had no eyes. Their families told me. Pierre, I'm going to Algiers. Do you need anything from there? - I don't, thank you. - I do. Please do me a favor. - Have a seat. - See you. Go to this address... Caroline? If I'm not mistaken, you keep old newspapers. Don't you? Only from the past two years. Nicole, please, button up that blouse. It's much too provocative. You think so? That's how I like it. You dress in such a way that anyone can know what you are. Men are difficult to come by lately. There's too much competition. - Nicole! - Yes! I mean you! Always so proud and so arrogant! But you've wasted no time getting in bed with that filthy drifter! It's not what you think. I'm not worried at all. He'll come back to me whenever I want. Experience is very important in these cases. Leave him alone! Don't go near him. He actually loves me. Not just for one night. He loves me. It's something that you've never had. You can relax now. I'm no longer interested in him. He's not enough for me. Come this way. This way, sergeant. Here he is. Has he been dead long? It's Jean. The man who worked for the Rulais sisters. Right? Yes, he is. He must have died from the stab wound. We are back to square one. Please, Michelle, try to calm down. Everything will be fine. If anything happened to him, I couldn't deal with it. He's the reason for my life. Why didn't you tell us? You could have brought him here. He could have lived with you. It's not easy for a single mother. I've lost jobs because of that, and I need money to support him. You must go to him right now. You must be with your son when they operate on him. But I can't leave you alone. - Is there no one here? - No. Claude went to town. I saw her leave this morning. What about Nicole? I don't know. I haven't seen her. It's all right. I'm fine. Don't worry. Your son is much more important now. - But... - Don't say another word. Go now. Thanks. I'll be back as soon as I can. I wish you the best. - Michelle? - Yes? - Lock the door. - So long. "You've already tried to kill me once. I don't want to give you a second chance. " I suspected it. Now I know your secret. You are in my hands. You wouldn't dare to kill me. No. Fran?ois, don't go! You will never be happy with that woman. I couldn't find my keys. Are the lights out? Yes, it must have been the storm. What's wrong? Ivette was startled when she saw me in the dark. What happened? She fainted. She's delirious now. It must have been a shock for her. She even tried to get up and walk. In Nicole's case we shouldn't be alarmed. She's probably just hanging around with a man. It's a shame, but that's the way it is. Nevertheless, I am worried. In this situation, anything is possible. Besides, Nicole is not blond, nor does she have blue eyes. According to you, those are the constant traits the assassin is looking for. That doesn't make me feel any better. It wouldn't surprise me if nurse Effrein, who didn't fit that mold either, was killed by the same individual. It could be. Well, I must leave now. I still have to stop by the bar. - So long, Philippe. - See you later, Pierre. Pierre, Pierre, look at this. It's Gilles! Alain Dupreil, that's his real name. An ex-con... No wonder he looked so familiar. I must have seen him in a bulletin. I will interrogate him. He could be armed and dangerous. You're right. I'll set up a guard. Caroline, let me have the phone. Miss! Miss! Line, please! Gilles, I got a phone call! They know about you. They're coming for you. I swear I will not go back to jail! They will not catch me alive! I'm going with you. I know a shortcut to the main highway. - It's the only way out. - Let's go. He escaped. He escaped! He's going through the shortcut to the highway. - Wasn't Ren? with you? - I haven't seen him. Stay here. I'll continue by myself. No. I will go with you. It's my destiny, not yours. Raoul. Cover her. Over there! Come with me! You must die! This time, I will kill you. You stole Fran?ois from me. But he will come back to me. He will come back. Ivette, you're making a mistake. I am not that woman. I am not. No, Ivette, no. - I am not her. - You won't trick me. Let me go! I know your eyes. I know your hair. I'll kill you again. I'll kill you a thousand times, if necessary. So you don't show up again. - Pierre, I've been told... - Take care of her! Come closer. It's the best thing you could do. Go away from here. After these events, nothing holds you back. I know it is difficult, but try to start your life over. I'm sure you will find someone who will make you forget. I can't believe that Michelle could have killed Ivette and so many others. Miss, the car is waiting outside. Thank you. - Good-bye, doctor. - Good luck. Can you wait for a moment? I think you'll be interested in this. Michelle did not kill Ivette as it first seemed. What? I'll show you. Given the position of the bodies and Michelle gripping the knife on her right hand, she could have only inflicted the wounds in these directions. But never on the back. It's obvious that there is a third person. Don't you think so, doctor? Yes, it could be so. Besides, I found the weapon that hurt Ivette on the leg. This is possible. There were wood particles in the wound. Where did you find it? On the way to the station. That's where Ivette was wounded. The splint was there in a pool of blood. But this is impossible, Ivette couldn't walk. She thought she couldn't walk. It's easy to think that after the accident, Ivette convinced herself of her paralysis, perhaps as a form of self-defense. But, in certain circumstances... Yes. In certain circumstances, I believe she was able to walk. So she could have even been the murderer. It's possible. There's the motive. The woman who stole her fianc? was blond and had blue eyes. The traits that the assassin looked for in the victims, according to your theory, Pierre. I've not been in town as long as you have, and I never met that woman, but I have another theory. These are the reports I requested from Algiers. They speak of a young girl who died after an eye operation, due to the negligence of a nurse. The nurse was removed from her professi?n for some time, and she even worked in other countries. She returned recently to Algiers. And what does that have to do with the events here? That nurse was Margot Dupr?, who never made it to your house, and shortly afterward showed up dead on the highway. I still don't understand where you are going with this. You recommended her, and she did not want to come here because she knew her life was at risk. Because you never forgave her for your daughter's death. Who was also blond and had blue eyes and was unable to regain her sight in the operation. Isn't that right, doctor? She's returned. You must kill her. She stole the man you loved. Tonight, when you hear this tune, follow it. It will bring you to her. Wake up, Ren?! That's how he controlled Ivette, and she became a toy in his hands. It was all a simple hypnosis game. You created in her a conditional reflex. The rest was telepathy. Just like these mice go to eat at the sound of the bell, Ivette would start walking when she heard the sound of the clock. Those are just theories! Ridiculous theories! You need proof! I have many, but this one is definitive. We found it on Nicole's body. It's a letter Margot sent to her when she turned down the job at Claude's house. There are many things against you in it. It was all her fault. She didn't want to help me. That's why I killed her. I killed her. That's why I killed her. I killed her. I killed her! Daughter, I will find eyes for you that will last forever, as beautiful as the sky and which will never die. I promise, I promise, I promise.
