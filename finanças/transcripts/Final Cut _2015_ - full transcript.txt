- Help, help! Help, help! Someone help! Please, you don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. No! Please, no, please! Wait, I know you! No! No! No! No! No! No, no, no! What are you working on now? The rewrite. James, the final edit is almost done. I mean, we're done. Clearly, you're not thinking straight. I know what's going on in my head. The next time I see Adler, I'm gonna fucking kill him. The script was stolen but not the film. How the fuck did that dickhead get his hands on the script anyway? You sure you want to trust me, James? The least I can do, with your film winning me that contest. I never did thank you for that, by the way. So thanks. Those are my fucking characters, okay. That was my goddamn scene. We're supposed to be a group, and you're acting like the leader of the pack? We're all equals. I am not gonna just hand him this DVD. He saw Adler's first. It doesn't matter. You wrote it. What's the idea as of now? It's an Alfred Hitchcock's noir horror film. You've got one month. That's all I'm giving you. First day back from break, put your final cut on my desk, or you all fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. - Mother! Randy, what the fuck? - Hey, James. - What are you doing here? - Uh, Rachel said you'd be here. But then I found this book. - Why? - It was just sitting on the floor, and then I picked it up, and it was really-- - No, what do you want? Why, why are you here? - You weren't answering your phone. - That's because I turned it off, Randy. I'll see you later. - I think you're overreacting, to be honest. - I think you're drastically under-reacting. He steals my film, and I'm the one paying for it. - Isn't it technically Rachel's film? - It is just as much the writer's as it is the director's. - Well, you're the expert, right? - In this room, yeah. - Are you gonna work out, or you just gonna play with your little ball the whole time? - I'm not gonna work out. ♪ Too cold, we already seen you in the casket ♪ - Don't you fucking light that in here. So you know what type of horror you're gonna do? You know, like found footage or like Paranormal Activity type of thing, Blair Witch, anything like that? - I mean, she wants to do a slasher, so-- - What she says goes. ♪ That's why I post it up on Facebook ♪ ♪ An instant, I spread it ♪ Fuck a bitch, I'm on Twitter - I don't know. I just, I want to do something different. You know, if it's got to be horror, I want to at least try to give it a fresh take. - In the end, it's just film school, right? ♪ I'm on in first place and over you ♪ ♪ Chasing like I'm made to do ♪ It pays to watch me ♪ Who would stack the money - Thank you. - You're welcome. - So tell me about yourself. Why do you want to be in our film? - That's an easy question. It'd be my first one. - Really? So no prior experience, then? - Oh no, I don't want you to think I'm incompetent. Uh, Rachel told me you were somewhat of a perfectionist. - A little more than somewhat. She's absolutely right, I am. And I'm gonna be completely honest and upfront with you, right now. I don't like working with first-time actors. Okay, we've done it in the past, and it's like fucking a virgin, and I just-- - James, really? - Really, what? I'm not trying to be graphic. I'm being honest. It's my project, too. I have a say. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to butt in, but you are just the writer, right? - Well, I wouldn't say it like that. I'm not just the writer. I mean, I have credibility. I mean, I have a little bit more responsibility than just like-- - Mm-hmm. I came to this school to study acting, and I guess, I got in, because I do possess some talent. I mean, I think so. In high school, we put on a lot of Agatha Christie's written work, and I had the lead role in each. - Okay, so you have a resume, kind of like every other actress that we've ever worked with. What's your point? - My point is that Agatha Christie never sat in my auditorium. I had to take direction from my director, which I guess in this case would be Rachel. - Okay, okay. You know what? I'm gonna let you handle this. I'm gonna go get myself a drink at the bar. - James, we're in a diner. - I'm getting a coffee. - Yeah? - Is that okay with you? You good? - Yeah, whatever. First off, you have to tell me how you did that. - Cool. - I'm really sorry. - Oh no, no, it's-- - No, it was rude, and I'm sorry. - No, don't worry about it. He just, he seems like a dick. - We're you really in a lot of Agatha Christie plays, or did you just make that up? - No, no, no, I was. I was. - Okay. - I know, I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. He's just like being, I think he's being a little weird. - No, he's always like that. You'll get used to it. Okay, all right. - It'll take a few years, but that's okay. This is Annabelle Short's first screen audition for Entrapment. Anna will be reading for the part of Vera. Offscreen, we'll have James reading for Joshua. Anna, whenever you're ready. - Okay. Okay, I'm ready. - Interior, dark room, night, petrified, Vera huddles behind Joshua as the smashing at the door continues. - He's almost through. - I know he is. - Saddened, Joshua turns and looks into her eyes. - And that is why I need you to go out the back entrance and down the stairs. I'll hold him off. He won't get to you. - Leaving you is not an option. - Vera, there's no time for a debate. You have to go now. - Joshua, I can't, okay. I love you. - And I love you, too. Now please, Vera, just go. - The smashing at the door is getting louder, louder. - Your love is the reason why I can't. - But it's the reason I can. The doors burst open. It's too late, Vera. - Okay, so how'd I do? - Janet Leigh would be proud. Hey, didn't mean to bother you. What are you doing? - Working on the ending. What's up? Nothing, I just wanted to see what you were up to. What are you doing? Really? - I just told you. I'm working on the ending. And it's shit, right now, so-- - Well, I'm gonna have to see it anyway. - Yeah, you will see it when it is perfect and not shit. - I'm gonna see it anyway. - Were you in the same room as me. Did you not see what I just saw? - Yeah. - The only reason that we're sticking with her is that scream. The scream was the best part. - All right, let's relax, okay. She's perfect. We're gonna use her. That's fine. - And we need a script. - How's the ending of the script going? - Terribly. - Listen. - The dialogue is-- - It's not that difficult to write a goodbye between lovers, okay. It's pretty generic stuff. - I know that it's generic. That's the problem. - You still have two weeks to get the dialogue right before we kill them, okay? You want to know something? - Not really, but sure. - Come on. Look, stop. It's gonna be brutal. - It's gonna be fucking brutal. Yeah, a little better, this time. - You got a little devil in you somewhere. It's okay. It's part of what makes us human. - So does love. - Mm-hmm. - Compassion. I mean, without that, what are we, really? - There's more to humans than just love, James. And you can-- - I think love is pretty important. - It is pretty important, but you can love someone in a lot of different ways. - You think so? - Yeah. - Hmm. I think love is pretty important. - Yeah. You got a little devil in you somewhere. That's okay. That's part of what makes us human. So is love. Mm-hmm. Compassion. I mean, without that, what are we, really? Hi, you've reached Rachel. I'm not at my phone, right now, but if you leave your name and your number-- You don't have to. No! - This fucking movie is tearing me apart. - I feel like you say that about every project you've ever done. How's this any different? - It's a fucking horror movie, man. - So at this point, who cares? I thought what we shot so far is great. And that sound girl, Francesca, I think she wants to date me. That's besides the point, okay. I'm talking about the... God, Rachel's just... God, I don't even fucking know anymore. And I'm at a loss for words. - Wait a second. Are you two actually having problems? - I'm not the one with the problem. James. What? - Nothing. Think you'll come to bed? - Later. - Well, what are you doing? Nothing. - Okay, well, who were you talking to? - Nobody. - Yes, you were. I heard you. - I wasn't talking to anyone. What, what is the 20 questions? - I see. Must be the mistress then, cheating on me, huh? After all these years. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What? - Who the fuck says that? I was talking to Adam. - It was a joke, chill. - Okay, well, it was one in extremely poor taste. Six fucking years, we've been together, Rachel, and I have been nothing but loyal to you. - What is going on, right now? What the fuck are we even fighting about? I know you've been loyal to me. I didn't say you haven't. I don't understand. - Who the fuck are you? What? - Well, you, well, you just, you treat me like I'm this little fucking loyal puppy dog that you're just gonna drag around on a leash. How long do you expect to do that? You gonna do that all our lives? - You're not even making any sense. Where is this coming from? - It's coming from you, okay. I am so sick and fucking tired of you being up my ass, 24/7, all the time. I can't take it anymore. - I'm up your ass? Are you kidding me? Yeah, are you kidding me? I let you have free rein over this project all year since it started, okay. I even looked past all your bullshit and obvious control issues, okay. You're the writer, James, remember that. You're the fucking writer. Try to get that through your-- - This isn't about the fucking film, Rachel! This is about you! - And what's wrong with me? Okay, what's your problem with me, all of a sudden? Okay, the girl who stood next to you, year after year, for what? For what, so we can fight? So we can just hate each other when the other one's back is turned? Okay, I love you, James. Remember that. Okay, but I don't even remember the last time I've-- - Just shut up! Okay, just shut the fuck up! I can't fuckin' do this right now, okay. Can you just, can you just get out? Just, just go. We will deal with this in the morning. - No, I'm not gonna leave. You started this conversation. Clearly, we're gonna finish it. We have to figure-- - No, we're not gonna finish it, just get the fuck out, okay. Just get the fuck out. - No, why would I get out? Stop! - Get the fuck out! - What are you doing? - Get out! It's incredible, isn't it? Yeah, it really is. - It's pretty cool that we're, like, in this building, you know. - Oh yeah, though, I was actually referring to the architecture. It has this beautiful classic quality about it, and the grounds are just magnificent, really. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, all that stuff too, yeah. So I hear you're from Connecticut, Massachusetts. - Is there anything more you want me to do? - Find a bar and get me the strongest thing on the fucking menu. Yeah, I'm not 21. - Fuck off. - Okay. Rachel, anything you want? - Randy, just sit somewhere. - Uh, okay. Are you sure? I really just want to be as much help as I can. - Fuck! All right, well, Adam's not picking up. I don't know what the fuck to do. - Call him again. - Thanks, genius. Why didn't I think of that? This kid has no idea what it means to be on time. Keep trying. - Wow, way to finally fucking show up. - Excuse me? - Are you kidding me? Are you in heels? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Heels on her fucking set? Are you kidding me? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Are you fucking nuts? - Go fuck yourself! Go fuck yourself! - If you don't give a fuck about this fucking project-- - Fuck off, fuck off! - Let the director do her job for once. - Then do it, for once. It's all yours. Deal with that. - Heels, really? - Oh yeah, you like them? They're brand new. - Yeah, no, I don't like it. - Excuse me? - Are you kidding me? - That's right. No, we're already all through a lot of this. - Are you kidding me? - It's our last shoot tonight, okay. No cell phones. - This is bullshit. - Then leave. Your choice. That goes for the rest of you. No cell phones tonight. Come on, yeah, not tonight. We have to get things done, all right. - Rach, we all really got to do this? - Yes, you do. - Just don't go through my shit, all right. - Yeah, I wasn't planning on it. - Everyone, come on, grab some stuff. Let's go. We're back in Hartman, tonight. - James, are you coming? - No, Randy, I'm not. I just, I just want a minute to myself. Hey! What are you doing? - If you're gonna fucking yell at me, right now-- - I'm not gonna yell at you! Let's just take a minute, okay. You wanna try calling Adam again? - Is it even worth it, at this point? We're like 20 minutes behind. We have to start filming. This is our last night here. - Our only alternative is that you put the costume on and play the welder. - No, I don't want to put the costume on. If I put that fuckin' mask on, my vision is tainted. Have Stan do it. - We don't really have another choice. Okay, Stan can't do it. He has a lot of special effects to focus on, tonight, so. - I'll do it. - No. - Just do it. Give me that. Thank you. Go change. - Fine, all right, I guess I'm doing it. - Hurry up. - There's a bathroom, one level down. Great. A little cold? What gave me away? - Where's your coat? - Upstairs. - Want a cigarette? It'll calm your nerves, and it'll take your mind completely off the cold. - No, I don't smoke. Well, here. I swear it's nicotine-free. - Thanks. The cold doesn't bother you? No, I fucking hate the cold, man. But when I'm smokin' one of these, you know, I hardly feel it. I don't know. It's, uh, what do they call it? A euphoric state. This is mine. Don't tell Rachel, by the way. She thinks I quit. - Why'd you start? - What, smoking? I don't know. I mean, my dad smoked all his life, and he's not around anymore, so-- Cancer? No, I wish. I mean, then we would've, we would've had him around for a couple more years. It wouldn't have been so sudden. - I'm sorry. - Nah, don't be. If he didn't pass, I don't think I ever would've wanted to be a writer. I would've got stuck in the family business. I still would've smoked, though. It's like, you know, how we all, in some way, kind of want to be a little bit like our dads. I don't know. It's some bullshit I learned in my psych class, sophomore year. - I don't get along with my dad. Parents are divorced. I'd rather be like you. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I mean, your work, your dedication, it inspires me. - Trust me, kid. You don't want to be like me. Yeah? What? - After tonight, we're home-free. This is your big defining character moment. - I'm not sure I'm seeing this the same way as you. As long as you can scream the same way you did in my living room, two weeks ago, you'll nail it. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do that. - I believe you. Randy? - Yeah. Where's my boyfriend? - Oh, he's still getting dressed. - What's taking so long? - Well, there was a, uh, his arm got caught in the thing, and I was-- - Randy, since when do you smoke? - I, um-- - Yeah, stop covering up for him and just go get him. I can do that. - Five minutes. Five minutes, both of you back here. Francesca! - Yeah? - Do you expect to get perfect, crisp sound from all the way over there? Anna? - Bitch. - James! Thank you for taking your time. I appreciate it. And by the way, I know about the smoking. Don't think we're not gonna be having a fight about this later, okay. But right now, I need you at 110 % in character. Got that? All right, people, let's do this. Okay, everyone, I cannot stress enough how important this moment is. Anna, I have complete faith. Everybody else, please don't fuck this up, okay. Francesca-- - I know what I'm doing. - Good enough. Okay, Anna, we just watched the welder bash in Joshua's head with a sledgehammer, and that's where we're gonna pick up. Um, when do you want me to scream? - Well, um, something's gonna happen during the struggle, obviously, but save the moneymaker for like a half a second right before he pulls your hair back, and the sledgehammer goes to your neck. Then we'll cut, and we'll let Stan work his magic on your throat. Something funny? - I'm sorry. It's just that there's never been a better time to say that's what she said. - Roll cameras. - Shots one and two, take one. - Action. - James. Come on, James, she's really starting to get pissed. I really hope you're decent in there, man. What? Oh my God. Jesus, oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. - Stop, please stop. You're, you're hurting me. - What is taking them so long. - Shh, they're killing it. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. No, no. - Rach. Rach, you got to call cut. I'm not, I'm not doing any of this. - Cut. Cut! - Holy shit! She's really fucking dead. Run, run! - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Run, run! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! - Please, come on, come on. Come on, is this a joke? It's a joke, right, come on. Please answer me! What the fuck? What the fuck happened? What is that? Is that a joke? No, Randy, run! Run, fucking run. - No, please don't, please, please, please! - Guys, he's right behind us. - Fuckin' doors are jammed shut! - Let's go! - No, you got to do this. I can get through. I can't run in these heels! - Fuck that! - Asshole! - Oh fuck! Come on, man. This is bullshit. Come on. James, you're my friend. Please. Oh God. - Shit! What the fuck are we gonna do? I mean, why'd we run upstairs, Rachel? - To buy time! We have to find a room with a door that locks. We have to hide. - Fuck that! I'm not just gonna sit around and wait while your psycho piece-of-shit boyfriend-- - Hey! Hey, fuck you! - Tries to kill everybody. - That wasn't James. I don't know who it was. - You don't know! Who is it, Rachel, who? - I don't know. I don't know. We can't sit here to find out. Okay, let's see here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna take Jaime, and we're gonna hide, okay. Please come with us. - Fuck you bitches. There's a balcony through this classroom. I'm climbing down the pillars and getting the fuck out of here. Yeah, have fun babysitting. - Stan, Stan, son of a bitch. Jaime, hey, Jaime, baby, come on. We gotta go. Okay, we gotta go. We gotta get out of here. Come on. - They killed her, right in front of us. We just let her die. - I know. - Where's James? Where's Randy? - I don't know. - Where's Francesca? - I don't know, but we got to go. - Oh shit. Shit. Oh my God. - Can you help me open this door? - We've got to go before he comes. - Okay. Come on. Right here, go. Come on! Oh go to hell! Oh my God, thank God. My baby, oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God, okay. Shit. Oh God, come on. 911, what's your-- - Shit. No, no! - This is hopeless. No one's coming, not until class in the morning. Security, maybe. There's a patrol every hour. - I raised hell, days ago, in the dean's office to make sure that didn't happen. I just wanted no interruptions on our last night. - Why is this happening to us? - Wrong place, wrong time. We're filming a horror movie. And now we're in one. - What did you say? - What? - Who else knows we're here, Rachel, who? - No one outside of us has the script, and we're all here, except for-- - Except the two actors who wanted to play Joshua. - Yeah, Chris, but he already went home. Otherwise, I would've had him here tonight for additional shots. - If not him, then who? - Adam. - Adam! Why wasn't he here? - Oh God. God, no. No, you don't, you don't know Adam like I do. He wouldn't do something like this, not to me, not to James. Oh God, James. Oh my God, I hope he's okay. Everything I know about horror movies is telling me that he's already dead. - No, no, maybe he's not. Maybe he, he and Randy got away, and it's not too late for him. It's not too late for you and me. And maybe all we have to do is just wait, like you told me, right, right? - That's all we can do, right? - Help! Anybody, please! Help! What now, you son of a bitch? You gonna kill me? Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and let it happen. I'm not backing into a corner, James. I know it's you under that fucking mask. Ow, fuck! Put down the hammer and fight like a fucking man. - It feels like we've been in here for hours. Do you know what time it is? - My phone's still in the bucket, downstairs. - Yeah, mine too. Don't you miss when these classrooms actually had clocks in them? The perks of high school. Yeah, I'm starting to miss that, right now. Did you like high school? - I was homeschooled for most of my life until senior year. I guess I liked that. - That's a long time to be homeschooled. Yeah, blame my mother. She didn't even want me to go to public school for my senior year. - What changed her mind? I threw a serious hissy-fit. I'm not proud of it. But if I didn't do it, I never would've met Caleb. I guess things do happen for a reason. - Is Caleb your boyfriend? - Yeah. He's the only guy I've ever loved. Where is he now? - Ohio State University. He left last week. That's where life took him. There was some film schools out there, too, but my mother said no. She said bad things happen to young women who go far away from home. That's so ironic, 'cause I'm 15 minutes away from my house right now, and I may never make it back. I might never get to see my mother again or call Caleb again. If I, if I have to die tonight, I have to hear his voice, one last time. I have to hear him telling me that he loves me, one last time. I have to, I have to get to my phone. I have to call him! - Jaime, no, Jaime, Jaime, you can't leave this room. - Oh yes, I can. - No. - You don't understand. - I do understand, Jaime, I do. Listen, Jaime, you can't leave this room. - No, I do. - No. I need to call him. I need to get to my phone. I need to get to my phone. - Jaime. - I need to call. - You can't leave this room. No, I have to call him right now. Jaime, you can't leave this room. Yes, I can. You don't understand. - I do understand. Jaime, James is out there, and I want to see him just as bad as you want to hear Caleb, but if we leave this room, tonight, before morning, we are gonna fucking die. - I guess I'm not as self-centered as you. I'm sorry. - Jaime. - What's gonna get me to Hartman quicker, left or right? - Left, down the hall, two flights down. - You're not coming? - No, Jaime, please, don't make me do this again, okay. If you stay, it doesn't make you a coward. Don't you want to live? If you stay, you don't have to call him for one last goodbye. You could go to Ohio and actually see him. Okay, please just get back in the room. - Rachel, he's out there. Please just come with me. Just come with me. No. Rachel, come on. - Jaime! Help! Anyone, help! Jaime! Jaime! No! Jaime! No! Let her go! No, please, Jaime! No, Jaime! Let go! No! No! Let go! Get off me! - Jesus! - Randy, you're okay! The door. - What is it? What the fuck? What the hell? Rachel, go call for help. - There is no fucking help. - Just go, run! Motherfucker! Oh God! - Randy. - No, no, no. I don't want to be here. I'm hiding. Let's go. - We have to go back. - No, no, Rachel, Rachel. No, we have to get a phone or campus security or both. We can't, oh shit, oh shit. Come on, come on, come on. Oh shit. No, no, no, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, look at me, look at me, look at me. We're gonna make it out of here, okay. We're not gonna die. Look at me, we're not gonna die, not today, okay? - Okay. - Do you believe me? Okay, okay. Okay, that's our cue to run. Okay, come on, come on, come on. Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Oh my God, I'm so happy to see you. I didn't think you were alive. Are you okay? What, what's the matter? - I'm fine. - What's the matter? - I'm fine. - It's good to see you, man. I thought you were dead. - I thought so too. Which one of you killed my best friend? Hmm? - James. What do you expect us to say to that? - My best friend is lying dead on the floor behind me. Who killed him? - I did. James, I did it to protect Rachel, for you, man. James, man, he was on a rampage. - Shut the fuck up! Was I talking to you? - Okay, okay, James, I know you're probably really, really fucking pissed, right now, but please, he literally became the killer in your script. - If you believe that, I don't think you read my final draft. You see, you weren't supposed to make it this far. - I was never in the-- - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Are you fucking kidding me? Is that really all you have to say right now? - So I think I'm gonna go. This seems like a personal issue between the two of you. - Get the fuck back. Hang on, buddy. You're not going anywhere. I mean, you chose to be here, right? Why the fuck else would you be standing in my living room? - James, he saved us. - Yeah, really? Because to me, it looks like you saved yourself. Either that or Randy did all the fucking ass-kicking. I find that pretty hard to believe. - Oh fuck you, you son of a bitch. He trusted you like a brother, and that's what you do to him. - Fuck him, fuck him! He was my brother. And now he's dead because of you. Everybody is dead because of you! And you. Tell me something, Adler. How did you know where we were gonna be tonight? How did you know? Did you come around to fuck my girlfriend again? Yeah. I thought so. Tell me something, Rach. How did he get my script? - No, you have to understand. - How did he get my script, Rachel? - I took it. Is that what you want to hear? Does it make you happy? - Not really. - One night, when she came over to my place, I went through her stuff, and I saw your rough draft. And it was better than mine. So I took it. - How noble of you. Rach, you wasted the bigger knife on the wrong killer. You want mine? - No. - I was never really much of a knife person. It's a little cliche. Go on. Take it. Take it. - Stop, please, stop! - Rach, sweetheart, I want you to know that I love you. It's not past tense. I still do. And that's why I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Stop it! - Bitch! - Hey, don't you touch her! Rachel, get the hell out of here. - No, Rach, stick around. Watch me bash his fucking head in. Not happening. Hey, buddy. Oh your turn, bitch. Rachel. Rach, there's only one tree in this yard, and you were stupid enough to hide behind it. Fucking bitch. Stop fighting! It's over. No! Get up. - James, I'm sorry. - No, you're not. - I'm sorry. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am, please. - You just don't want to die. It's okay. It's almost over. James! - She's dead, lover-boy. You lose. I win. Just like our films, you're always gonna be second-best. - Not if I kill you first. - Movie's over, asshole. You're too late. - Not yet. Motherfucker! Oh fuck. Oh I think you broke my fuckin' jaw. - Not enough? Oh you hit like such a bitch. - I'm just getting warmed up. I don't smoke. Rach! Rach, it's over. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Rach. You're gonna be all right. I promise. I promise. You'll be all right. You're gonna be all right. Everything's over. - I'm really proud of us. Our first feature film, and I think we have a winner at this year's Horrorfest. - You really think so? - I really do. And now we can start working on our submission forms, now that we have an official title. - Uh, when did this happen? - Well, as the director, I took the liberty of coming up with this one on my own. - Okay, and you didn't think that I deserved some say in the matter? - Some, but I think you'll feel differently after you see my surprise. - Oh yeah? Is your surprise you walking out on me? Because that would be a total buzzkill right now. Can you hold on a second? - Boom, second's passed. Give me my surprise. - Shut up. - Here it is. - Yeah, I can see that. You didn't even bother to wrap it. - Anyways, I had this printed out just for you, but I wanted to wait until we got the final cut from Joe. But here it is. So congratulations. - Final Cut? - An original screenplay by Max Starvey. - And directed by Kate Adams. - Do you think people will find it overly pretentious that we cast ourselves in this film? I mean, maybe if we were the leads, but we're freakin' Anna and Randy. - Right, that's true, maybe you, more so than me. - Oh no, no. Our roles hold the same weight. - They did, until you wrote yourself into the ending. - Okay, that is not how it happened, and you know it. - You didn't want to die on page 60, so you wrote yourself back in on page 80. I mean, it kind of worked. It did work, I guess, but I-- - But nothing. You loved it. I'm beginning to think that we're becoming just like our characters. - Well, we were the basis. James and Rachel wouldn't exist without us. It's almost like a true story, except, you know, without all the, uh, the murder. - Okay, not everything about it was true. - I know. That's why I said without the murder. - I was referring to the cheating. - Yeah, I caught that. - Why don't I go pour us a glass of champagne? - Sure, uh, I got to get something out of the car anyway. - Okay, don't be long. - Okay. - They call it a euphoric state. This is mine. Max. - Yeah? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Well, here you go. What should we toast to? - Um-- I got it. Simply put, to the cast and crew of Final Cut. - To trust. - To love. Um, dinner's in the other room. - I'll meet you in there, in a minute. - Okay. I'm beginning to think we're becoming just like our characters.
