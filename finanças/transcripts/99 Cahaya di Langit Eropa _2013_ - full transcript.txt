In the early 15th century, Türkiye managed to conquer almost all regions of Eastern Europe. In 1683, Turkish troops under the leadership of Kara Mustafa managed to surround the Austrian forces. But later, the Austrians received military assistance from Poland and Germany so that they defeated Kara Mustafa's forces. Children, that's the history of the siege of Vienna in 1683. The siege ended when the military assistance came. The Poland troops helped Vienna. The were together in fighting the troops of Kara Mustafa. Kara Mustafa lost the battle and had to leave Vienna. - Mrs. Eldemann, was Kara a Turk? - Yes, he was, Leon. Just like Ayse. Maybe he is Ayse's grandfather. No, I don't know him. But you're a Turk and wearing a veil like Kara Mustafa. She's wearing a veil too. Why can't I? Enough, kids, enough. Leon, Ayse's wearing a veil because she's a Muslim. I see. But Kara Mustafa was a Muslim too, right? That's a lie. Ayse. That's not about your personal. But that was the history of 1683. So no need to argue. Okay? This is Vienna. The city where world classic composer like Strauss and Schubert were born. While Mozart and Beethoven chose to spend his entire life in this city, writing legendary classical music for all time. It is love that brought them into this city. So did I. I thought, living with my husband, Rangga, who has got a doctoral scholarship in this country, was something joyful and sweet to experience. It turned out that it was not as easy as we thought. I don't understand you're saying. This is not chicken. This is pork. It's pork. Chicken is gone. You're a Muslim? I got something else for you. This one. This is healthy food. Not pork. When my husband, Rangga, is busy with his studies, I spend my days exploring every corner of the city of Vienna. I need a job. I can do anything. Sorry, there are no vacancies here. Please help me. I really need a job. No vacancies here. Moreover, your German is not fluent. Please, help me, madam. It's hard to find a job here if you can't speak the German language fluently. It's not easy to live in Europe with a different culture and tradition, away from family and close friends to tell stories. Three months has gone by. All that sweetness now becomes sour when there's nothing that I can do. All is so different when Rangga and I have to deal with a dilemma. Being jobless and doing nothing in the apartment makes me bored. It had crossed my mind to go back to Indonesia. Until finally... I found something. FREE GERMAN COURSES FOR 3 MONTHS And it changed my life. 99 LIGHTS IN THE SKY OF EUROPE Your religion is complicated. Pork is good, you know. Especially here in Europe, it's real cheap. Have you tried it? In my country, there are some people who eat dogs like this. No way could I eat my own dog. Why? No way I will break His rule. No wonder Professor Reinhard praises your dissertation highly. Here. Chicken curry my wife cooked for you. Thank you. Chicken? Chicken. Want to try it? No. I don't like curry. It smells bad. Sorry. I didn't mean to insult your wife's cooking. Good morning. My name is Elfriede Bauer. I'm happy to see all of you in this class. Let's see who's here. Roxana Benedict. Good. Kopagadyev? - Hanum Salsabi-ela. - Hanum Salsabiela. - Where are you from? - I'm from Indonesia. Fatma Pasha. Pasha? - What's your name? - Fatma. Fatma Pasha. We now start our first lesson. Aren't all the rooms here public rooms? Didn't they prepare room for you guys? Don't you know? Let's move. - Chocolate? - No, thanks. I'm fasting. Monday-Thursday fasting? - Are you a Muslim? - Yes, I'm a Muslim. Well, take it for breaking the fasting. Thanks. My train is here. I have to pick up my child, okay? - Hey, Fatma, may I come with you? - Come. This is the place. - Take it as a tolerance room. - What tolerance? What has gotten into Professor Reinhard? I'm not sure it's right if we pray here. It's about the intention, not the place. - God is great. - God is great. Have you been here long? But why do you take the same German class that I take? I just stay home. That's why my German isn't progressing. Your German was the best in our class. Seriously. Why don't you find a job? - It's hard, Hanum. - Why? Maybe because of this. Come on. Your veil stinks. Go wash it. Ayse darling, leave your veil at home so that Leon doesn't tease you. Please, Ayse. A little girl like you is not supposed to wear a veil here. Please think about it. I can't take it off. My daughter, Ayse, is my sun, Hanum. For me, family comes first. Even though I still can't work, and our life fully depends on my husband, I still want to give Ayse the best education in Europe. Nice. Nice design. I want to be a Muslim clothes designer. So I can go around the world and see Islam heritage in Europe. - Islam heritage in Europe? - Yes. Paris, Córdoba. My friend Marion is from France. She's a historian and she told me about the facts of Islam heritage in Europe. It's very interesting. Especially about Napoleon Bonaparte, that, according to her, converted to Islam. Mom! What's wrong, Ayse? Why are you crying? Leon said I was related to Kara Mustafa. That's Leon, Mom. He said Muslims are evil. Like Kara. Hi, sweet girl. Do you want chocolate? - Thank you. - Ayse, this is Aunty Hanum. Hi, Ayse. Ayse, look at me. Ayse, what Leon said is not right. Look at Aunty Hanum. Do you think she's evil? All right, stop crying. But why doesn't Aunty Hanum wear a veil like me and you, Mom? This isn't nice, Ayse. Aunty Hanum is having headache. - So she can't wear a veil. Right? - Yes. I still got a headache. When I'm free of headaches, I'll wear a veil just like you and your mom. Promise? I promise. Impossible. Ayse wears the veil of her own free will. - I don't force her. - Mrs. Pasha, I understand. But as Ayse's mother, you must explain to her that she doesn't have to wear it at school. Ayse is bullied by the other kids every day. How can you let it happen, Mrs. Pasha? Please, talk to her. Please. Ayse loves her choice. Is it wrong? No, it's not wrong. But you must understand that she'll be always teased. I don't believe a brilliant student like you isn't ready to take his exams. - It's not like that. - I want you to do me a favor. Teach me. But don't do it here. Maybe some other place? What's going on between you and Maarja? - It's not the right time. - What's up? I got a headache about my exams. - What happens on Friday? - Friday prayer. Is your God only available on Friday? And I don't understand. Ever since you got close to that curry man, you've changed, Rangga. You're not the same man who first came to Vienna and lived in my apartment. Have you checked out our exams schedule? Professor Reinhard's crazy! If I'm given lots of homework and assignments, I don't mind. But if he asks me to sacrifice my worship for exams, that's too much. We should talk to Professor Reinhard. Maybe there's a way out. - "We"? - Yes. No way, Rangga. When it comes to worship, I don't negotiate. You're on your own. Are you cooking something? What's wrong, honey? What happened? Hon? More soup? What's wrong? You have no appetite. The salted fish are good. Sometimes I don't get how the local people treat immigrants. Even a veil becomes big deal. Is this about Fatma and her daughter? What's her name again? Ayse. That's how they are. They judge appearance, not skills. I too have some problems. I don't wear a veil and it's hard to find a job, let alone Fatma. I apply everywhere but got rejected just because of a veil. You look beautiful with a veil. I'm done eating. We don't connect. I'm serious, hon. This Danube River is the biggest in Europe. - You know "The Blue Danube"? - I think I've heard it. The song was inspired by this river. Where do we go after this? You said you wanted to know more about Islam heritage in Europe. - We better start from here. - From this river? No. Ayse, where will we take Aunty Hanum? Kahlenberg Hill. There it is. Come on, hurry up, Aunty Hanum. - Come, in here. - Ayse. This one. - Isn't it beautiful? - So beautiful. - We're on the hill now. - Yes. - Aunty Hanum, I want to take a picture. - You want to try? - Okay. - It's beautiful from here. - Look here, Aunty. - Yes. - There. - Beautiful. Wait. Over there, sweetie. There. This hill is a historical witness of the defeated Turks who tried to expand into Western Europe. - The history of Mustafa. - Mommy. What? She's like this whenever she's cold. - Let's find a warm place. - Okay. UNIVERSITY - BUILT ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN OF HEINRICH FERFTEL Why did we go into a church, Fatma? Being inside a church to warm your body isn't wrong, Hanum. Why? Have you never seen people praying before? I just can't believe you guys. Why do you believe in prayer? The most important thing is to try, and this. The most important thing is to try and to pray. I bet that even though you pray until you get old, the exam schedule is not going to change unless you try. Talk in person with Professor Reinhard. What do you do after class? That's my biggest problem. You should say this to that big problem. "Hey, big problem, I have a God that is greater." Okay. I want to be a reporter like when I was in Jakarta. But apparently it's hard in here. Italian cappuccino. This is real. - Do you know the history of cappuccino? - What? The coffee you're drinking is not from Italy, but from a conflict between the Turks and the Austrians. I didn't know that. After the war at the Kahlenberg Hill, the Turks left the coffee beans. These coffee beans were taken by the Europeans and processed into the coffee you're drinking now. - Oh, yeah? - Interesting, right? Okay. Thanks, madam historian. Mom, I want to go to the toilet. Let's go. - Finish your croissant. - Don't eat, Ayse. Don't, Fatma. - Why? - That man said that we eat ourselves if we eat that croissant. - They need to get a lesson. - Hanum, I have another plan. The bill, please. - Fatma, what's that for? - You'll understand later on. - Hanum, after class tomorrow I will... - You are coward! - What? - Why didn't you defend yourself? Your religion, even your country has been mocked by them too. - Hanum... - But you paid their bill instead. We must be able to fight. Don't let yourself be trampled on. We must show them we're strong, not just some pushover. - We have to show them. - That we're terrorists? - Is that so? - Mommy. I once was like you. Cold. Needed some adjustment. Eventually, you will feel warm and be able to think clearly dealing with that kind of situation. I'm not an angel, Fatma. I'm just an ordinary human. But it's compulsory for me. With this veil, I must be a good Islam agent. Be a blessing. Sincere. And bring peace to anybody, including those who are not Islam. And be a pushover. Is that so? Sometimes that's what make us victors. It's better having war of imaginations, not weapons. We face it with brave heart. - Bye. - Bye, Ayse. Let's go. Bye. Hon, if you're slapped, are you going to slap back? - What kind of question is that? - Are you going to slap back or not? I don't want to be slapped, I want to be kissed. Why did you react like that? I'm serious, hon. There were tourists making fun of us. But Fatma paid for their food instead. I can't believe that Fatma did that. What for? Maybe she meant good. We should've done something. Anything. You're too sensitive. Here, I'll give you an example. Be fair. Kiss me back. I kiss you, you kiss me back. - I'm serious. - I'm serious. No. Get away from me. PROFESSOR OF NATIONAL ECONOMICS FINANCE MINISTER - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Mom, where's Aunty Hanum? - Maybe she won't come with us. - How about just us go sightseeing? - Okay. - What a beautiful church, right, Mom? - This is not an ordinary church. This church was inspired by mosque's towers in Türkiye. Your ancestors were the inspiration for this church's construction. That's why you must be proud to be a Muslim, Ayse. Aunty Hanum! I thought you wouldn't come because of yesterday's incident. - Where are we going now? - Where? This is the Vienna Museum. A long time ago, a dead man's face was printed like this so that they could see their own death mask. Mourning the mistakes of their lives. You'll never understand, Sir. Fatma? Where are you? Fatma? Where are you? Fatma? Why are you crying? Who is he? Isn't that the name that you mention often, Ayse? - Yes. - And my name's Fatma Pasha. What? So you're the descendant of Kara Mustafa? Let's go, Hanum. Let Kara Mustafa spend his nights here to regret what he has done. GERMAN COURSE LANGUAGE CENTER Good. Enough for today. We meet again for exams. Don't forget to study. Fatma, where do we go after this? Today I'm taking you to a place that is more special than any museum. - About your exams that crash... - The Friday prayer? Right. I can help you out if you want to. I can tell Professor Reinhard that I also can't make it. So I... - No, you don't need to. - It's okay. - I don't mind lying for you. - But I don't want you lie for me. But thanks, though. I forgot something. Excuse me. - Where are we going? - To my house. - Come, Aunty Hanum. - To your house. Yes! Come on! Latife and Esra are my friends in Vienna. They're Islam agents and the number one halal meat seller here. Amen. - Fatma, is she non-Muslim? - No, she's Muslim. Hanum, we thought you're not Muslim because you're not wearing a veil. Sorry. Fatma usually brings friends who want to shahada. Like us long ago. - Actually, we need you to do us a favor. - What kind of favor? Fatma says that you speak very good English. We used to have an English teacher named Marion Latimer. - My friend, that French historian. - Yes, Marion. We want to continue the English course Marion did for the children. - Whose children? Yours? - Not ours, but our students. Hold on. This is some of their pictures. They eager to read the Qur'an. We help the best we can. These are the converted children from England and America who live here. - Do they still study? - I think they do. So, Hanum, can you help us? No problem, as long as I don't cook. Thank God, we have new teacher. Thanks, Hanum. If I had the choice, I would've wanted God to introduce me to these people many years ago. If I could turn back time... I wish I could tell Kara Mustafa Pasha... that his descendants are true Muslim agents. Because Islam is not only faith, but a mandate. What they do matters. It's true. What they do is extraordinary. They don't merely open my eyes and heart, but arouse my soul. This is from Fatma. Don't run, Ayse, or you'll fall. Watch out! Ayse! Let him go through. Come, Aunty. Come. I think what you do is right. You guys succeeded in redeeming Kara Mustafa Pasha's mistakes. Thanks, Hanum. There are so many. Did your husband collect these? - Actually, Ayse did. - Ayse? Yes. Latifa and Esra gave her these magnets. Cute, huh? She said one day she would go to those places. God willing, she would. Why don't we make a plan to travel around Europe like you want? Yes, if God willing. Now I begin to understand the meaning of true Islam. Because in Islam, it is not about the sword, but peace. Because Islam is creativity, not symbols. Sometimes we're too lazy to think of how to make other people smile. In fact, it's really easy, isn't it? Everybody has choices. And I know your choice is the best for you right now. God willing. When it comes to worship, I don't negotiate. You're on your own. Rangga told me a lot about you. He must have said that I was annoying and fussy. He said you have big tolerance for Islam. - Where is he? Still praying? - In exams. Why didn't you tell me? Well, that's okay. There's still time for the Dzuhur prayer. Let me take you to the mosque. - Peace be with you. - Peace be with you also. I'm sorry, Priest. I can't go for Friday prayer because I have exams. Hon! Come here, honey. - Come here. - What is it? Do you remember about the tourists that mocked Islam and Türkiye? - Whose lunch was paid by Fatma? - Yes, and Fatma gave them her email. He sent an email. Take a look. Hold on. - Cool, isn't it? - It's really cool. I want to reply to it. It's not easy to believe that kindness is the best way to respond to bad deeds. But today I learned... that smiles could win over anger and hatred. I realized the true role of a good Muslim agent from Fatma Pasha. - Have you started looking for a job? - I have. But haven't got one yet. I'm just afraid that I will get bored living in Vienna. There must be a way for you. You should read this. Again two women from Austria were arrested for praying in the mezquita of córdoba. What do they actually want? Do you know? - I don't understand. - What do they ask for? They only ask for their right to worship. Have you read it? But it's no longer a mosque. Do they have to break the rule? Actually, these people are identified with violence. Right? Sometimes. Sometimes, in some places, violence is louder. What? - Did you say I'm a terrorist? - I said... Did you say I'm a terrorist? I heard you say it. I only said this is a terrorist's trick. - I only said that. - Hush. This is a library. Nothing. What's wrong with him? Mom, I'm dizzy. - Dizzy? - Dizzy? - Let me carry you. - Carry me. You must be happy Professor Reinhard gave you the opportunity - to join the conference in Paris. - I'm even happier you can come with me. - Good day. - Good day. - See? He likes it. - What did you do? - It's a Muslim agent's secret. - Muslim agent's secret. Where are we going to eat? They said there's a special restaurant with a Muslim atmosphere. - Is Fatma's husband coming too? - Yes, he is. Is it true you can eat your fill and pay as you wish? Most importantly, it's not salted fish anymore. - Mom, I want to go pee. - Hold on, sweetie. Come with me. Let me take you. Are you guys still going to Paris? I have something for Hanum. Here. It's for Hanum. If it wasn't for you, she'd have gone back to Indonesia. Another thing. This is my friend's Marion's card. Call her. She'll take Hanum sightseeing so she doesn't bother you there. Marion taught Fatma and her friends English. Fatma was a witness when Marion said the shahada in a Vienna mosque. Hang on, hon, she's not here yet. - You want to go? - No. It's close. I can wait. - I won't leave you. - How long? One hour. We still have time. - Peace be with you. - Peace be with you also. How are you? Welcome to Paris. - Are you Marion? - Yes. I'm Marion. I didn't expect this because I thought you didn't wear a veil. When I returned to Paris I officially wore a veil. And, praise God, it has many benefits. I realized a veil is a Muslim way to defend Muslim women's dignity. - Why do you give me that look? - Nothing. Mr. Rangga, you can leave so you won't be late. Yes, I have to go now. Maybe we can grab lunch after this. - All right, I have to go. Be safe. - Bye. Islam played a major role in developing culture in Europe. Do you know, Hanum, which city is called the City of Light? - Paris, right? This city? - No. There's a city which inspired Europe to become as modern as it is today. Philosopher Ignurus, a Muslim scientist, had opened the way for Europe to be a bright civilization. - Which city? - Córdoba. Paris isn't just glamourous, Hanum. I found my faith here. This city is also keeping many mysteries of Islam. I will show you. This is the Louvre. It is not only famous for its Mona Lisa painting, but also keeps a big secret inside. Is it that famous painting, Marion? Are you interested in seeing a way more phenomenal painting than the Mona Lisa? - Is it here? - Yes. Follow me. What do you think is weird about this painting? - What's weird? - Pay attention to the veil. Nothing's weird. Hanum, if you pay attention the side of the veil, I believe you'll see something. Yes, it looks like Arabic writing. But I can't read it, though. Because there's no vowel. It's Arabic writing. It says "Sudzukuvig". Do you want to know the meaning of it? What's that? Can you see here? "There's no God but Allah." It says "There's no God but Allah" on the veil of Mother Mary? Not here. We'll answer it later, okay? So, the ancient artists painted Arabic letters without knowing precisely what the meaning was. They didn't understand and didn't know the meaning. Yes, because they thought it was only ordinary decoration. Wow. It means the influence of Islam culture towards the rise of Europe is so big. Europe should've been indebted to Islam civilization. Now, I want to show you this. This is the painting of King Roger which kept in the Vienna Museum. Look at his robe. "There's no God but Allah." So, Vienna has it too. It means maybe the writing is everywhere. Could be. Fatma, one day I want us to explore Europe like you want. To Córdoba and Istanbul. Take Ayse and Celin. Thank you for introducing me to Marion. This is the Gate of Victory, or "Arc de Triomphe," of Paris. - Arc de Triomphe. - Yes. If you pay attention, if we go straight... This is the Champs-Élysées. - There we see a golden monument. - Yes. It is called the Obelisk monument. And there, a big water fountain. Now, there's a question. All are in a straight line. It's a really straight line. This straight line is ahistoric, and it was Napoleon's idea after he expanded into Egypt. If we draw a straight line towards the east, we'll find the most impressive building on this earth. And what do you think is that, Hanum? - The La Défense building? - No. To the east. East, Hanum. Nothing's special is in the east, except beyond France. Beyond France to the southeast, past the Swiss Alps, - past Italy and Greece... - Across the Mediterranean Sea, Then Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mecca... The Kaaba? So, Napoleon intentionally made that statue facing the Kaaba, Marion? Oh, that's him. I was just wondering. Speak of the devil. How was the conference? - Thank God it went smooth. - Thank God. Well, I have to go now. Why don't we... But Hanum... May I leave this letter for Fatma? And this package for Ayse. I really miss them. - Peace be with you. - Peace be with you also. - Where did you go? - Many places, hon. It's true what Fatma said. The more we travel, the more we know, the more we understand people, the better we know the meaning of mutual respect. - Now, we go over there. - Up there? - Yes. - Okay. Fatma, history has recorded that there's an imaginary straight line that connects the buildings and a street in Paris to one point. The street that makes anyone fall in love with Islam, fall in love with Europe. The name of that street is Rue de Rivoli, which means Victory Street. And I saw it for you. It's sunset. Let's get ready for prayer. Rangga! I brought you food. Don't worry. It's chicken. I can't. I'm fasting today. No food or drink. Thanks anyway. Excuse me. Fasting for what? So that we can learn to resist temptation, hunger, and be rewarded. - You're fasting to get rewarded. - Yes. - That's so easy. - Want to try? - Until what time? - 8:00 p.m. - We try it? - Okay. Let's start from now. - You have your reward there. - Have I? You do. What are you doing? Hanging in there? Hungry? - Holding on? - Yes. Just fast-forward the time. - What? - The sun will set soon. - Look at the clock. - Not too long now. It's okay. You learned enough today. No, I'll be with you fasting. Don't worry. - It's okay. Drink it. - It's okay. So refreshing. Rangga, I have question. Why does your God loves to torture His people? Listen. Fasting, praying five times. Crammed into Mecca. Praying, fasting and Hajj are my insurance premiums to God. Look. How do you pay your insurance monthly? - Eighty Euro. - Expensive. What is that for? Because there's no such thing as free lunch. You're worried that if something happens to you and you're admitted to the hospital and no one cares, the insurance will cover everything. Right? The insurance company that I pay into does exist. I know where it is. Where is your God's office? What if your God doesn't really exist? If God doesn't... Oh, my God. Imagining that your God doesn't exist, you turned white. I've never been burdened by what I do. I'm content. I'm peaceful. But you? If you got hit by a car and the insurance premium doesn't cover everything, what would you do? Well, let see if I got hit later on. I want to do something. - Hanum? - Thanks. The student with the highest score is Fatma Pasha. Congratulations. Wait. Where's Fatma? Hanum, do you know where she is? I don't know. Anyone knows where she is? Too bad. She should've been standing here as the best student. I wish you all success with your ability to speak German in your daily life. Fatma? - Have you tried to call or text? - I have. - Email? Facebook? - I've tried it all. A carrier pigeon too. I forgot. Fatma left something before we went to Paris. Fatma? What was it? Why didn't you tell me? - I forgot. - How could you forget? She really thought of me. So I didn't get bored. Check this out. It's a way out. But where is she? Excuse me. Have you seen Fatma and Ayse? I'm sorry. I never see them anymore. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hon? - You're up already. - Yes, I am. I just replied to Marion's email. She asked if we delivered the things she left with us. I said not yet. I haven't run into Fatma. - Where are those things? - You were holding onto them. - I forgot. - Go look for it. Don't lose them. - I think I put it there. - It's important. - I got it. Hold on. - Let me see. Let me see. - Does Fatma have cancer? - No. I don't know. Dear Fatma, how are you? I hope you're well. I sent you an email, but I didn't get a reply from you. Next month, I'll be moving to Egypt. Please pray for me. And give my regards to Hanum. She has represented you in seeing the Islam civilization in Paris. That's why she has to carry it on for you and Ayse. The little girl who inspired me. How is Ayse's chemotherapy? Her hair must have fallen out. I got you this French herbal remedy to cure it. I know Ayse's veil is not only to cover her fallen out hair, but also the proof of her faith in Islam. Aunty, if you want to read Qur'an, you should wear a veil first. Now you look more beautiful, Aunty. Now, let's study. First, Surah Al-Fatihah. It turns out it was Ayse who has cancer. But why doesn't Aunty Hanum wear a veil like me and you, Mom? You should say this to that big problem. "Hey, big problem, I have a God that is greater." All right. Aunty Hanum and Mommy, take a picture together. It's so strange, honey. Ayse... She loved this hill. You know, she was the first one who complained that I didn't wear a veil. Good. She didn't look sick, hon. A very critical kid. Ayse must be proud to have an aunty like you. I really love Europe. Not because it has the Alps or the Eiffel Tower. But... because I've found dots of lights in the sky of Europe. Those lights show up in the sky. Lights that wants us to read the signs in nature that lead us to keep moving forward. To be creative and innovative. They're shooting. They seem Indonesian. - Peace be with you. - Peace be with you also. - Hello, I'm Fatin. - Hey, are you Fatin? I'm Hanum. - Are you making a music video? - Yes, a video of a religious song. My producer wants me to shoot a music video in Europe. And one of the historical Islamic places that we want is here. Like what Marion and Fatma said, Islam is not just about the path we choose, but also the footprints that we leave behind. Islam civilization is built by labor and creativity to reach His blessings. Not just by symbols. I believe that wherever Marion and Fatma are, God has lit that light for me through them. They have transformed my boredom into hope. I still want to continue this journey. So, what's our plan after this? - I want to go to Córdoba, hon. - Córdoba, Spain? - Yes. - What do they have there?
