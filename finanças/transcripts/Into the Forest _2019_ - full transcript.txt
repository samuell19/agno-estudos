Nick! Leave me the fuck alone, go away! Hey, fellow believer here. I don't know if it's true. The Rudwick Forest, the Legend of the Shapeshifting Witch, I don't know but I definitely think it's worth checking out. Our son went missing from Rudwick seven years ago. We're still hoping out hope after all these years because we heard him. It has to be the Rudwick Forest. The missing persons rate there is 10 times higher than any other location in America. We used to go hiking out there in those woods. We started seeing some weird shit in that forest. Hearing some weird voices, weird noises. People say there's a witch up there too, I don't know. This is our mom and she went missing in the Rudwick Forest. The police stopped looking for her but we never did. He was calling for help, he sounded hurt. We tried to follow his voice but we couldn't find him. He's still out there, he's still alive. What's up, believers? It's your boy Jimmy coming to you straight from the Creep Jeep here with some very exciting news for you guys. Right now as we speak... - Put it down. - Nick, relax. - I'm not gonna break it. - Oh yeah. That's what you said about the C100. But the people need to see my face in stunning high definition... You're holding our entire production budget, so please be careful. I'm always careful, Nick. Anyway as I was saying, we have tallied all of y'all's innumerous votes determining where our next haunted location shall be and the winner in a unanimous landslide victory is Rudwick Forest and we can't wait to bring you guys along with us for more paranormal activity. But if that news was not exciting enough, Amy, should I tell them? - Yeah, let's tell 'em. - Listen. Our deal with A&E has been finalized. - Big leagues, baby. - It's the big leagues indeed and that means you guys can expect tons more heebie-jeebie shaking, mind-tingling, goosebump-raising with our quest into the great unknown. All right, you know what? I think it's time to get my baby back. - Come on, gently, gently. - Road trip. I don't think we're gonna get any music today. Just scan it. Have we confirmed times with both of 'em? Yeah, both the father and the Ranger are booked. Oh, but the Ranger said he won't come to the cabin. Why not? He said it's too close to the woods. Great, well that's more money that we get to spend on gas. Nick, relax. It'll be worth it, it'll be a great interview. Oh Amy, your nose. What? Oh. Shit Jimmy, will you get me a napkin? Yeah yeah, one second. - Come on Jimmy, Jimmy. - Yeah? Put her seat back, put her seat back. Shit, let me put the camera down. There you go, put it back. Grab her pillow. Come on Ames, now come on. Here we go, I got her, I got her. There we go, okay we're good. Here we go. I thought she was taking these new meds. - Yeah, so did I man. - You all right? I'm all right, you all right? - Yeah, I am. - Good. We're all good then, we're all good. I still think we should call Dr. Mathis. No baby, I'm fine, I promise okay? I just hadn't taken my pill enough for it to build up. Okay. Do you want anything from inside? Yeah. - Can I get a Twizzlers please? - Sure. And a King Size Snickers for yours truly. Thank you very much, also hey, Red Bull, Nick. Red Bull, bubble gum, beef jerky, spicy. - Not teriyaki, I want spicy. - You get one thing. One thing, I'm the star of the show. - You get one thing. - Cheap bastard. You had pick of the litter, pick of the litter and you choose this cheap bastard. He means well, you are just a mooch. That may be but, still. You okay? I don't think I've ever seen you seize up this early in a trip before, Ames. Yeah, I'm fine, I promise okay? Good. I'm glad to hear that. Hey, have you heard back from the executives about our contracts? Yeah no they, I don't know. They said something about checking with their lawyers, some lawyer shit they're doing, I don't know. They said they would make sure they're good. - Keep me posted, okay? - Yeah yeah, I will. - Jimmy. - Stop, I'm doing my hair. - Lock your door. - Wait wait, look look. Some of my paparazzi potentially. - Yeah, one of your fans. - Yeah, do you blame 'em? Excuse me, is that a camera I see. Yes, we are shooting for our paranormal TV show. Does that mean y'all are heading up to Rudwick Forest? - Yeah. - Well let me tell ya, all the rumors about that place are true. - Nice. - Mm hmm. My second cousin Davis went missing up in them woods and the police never found the body. Mm mm, it's like it disappeared, poof, into thin air. That is awesome. So thanks for talking... What channel did y'all say this was gonna be on again? Well, this is actually gonna be on A&E. - Yeah. - That's right. - Oh my god. - We are their newest stars. Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV? You're gonna be on TV a little bit. I'm gonna be on there a lot. You'll also see them on there occasionally but not really. But yeah, hey would you want to say our catchphrase with us? Oh my god, I would love to, what is it? Three, two, one. I'm a believer! I can't believe I'm gonna be on TV. My boyfriend's gonna lose his damn mind. There is nothing out here. Like literally nothing. Nick, are you sure we're going the right way? - This does not look right. - Yeah man. I mean if I could get the GPS to work, then I could probably tell you where we're at. - Here, let me try. - You know, God forbid we ever go to a nice, exotic location to find these haunted places, you know, like Fiji, the Maldives, Vegas. Yeah, it's still not working. How far did it say last time you checked? I thought it said just a couple of miles. Oh yeah, no big deal. Don't beat yourself up. You just got us lost in a killer haunted forest with a witch, no big deal, we're fine. Wait wait, is that it up there? Well isn't this just lovely? Not as bad as it probably could be for being way out here in the middle of nowhere. - We're on a budget, Jimmy. - I know, we always are. Here we go, these must be our guys. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I didn't know the guys from Deliverance still rented cabins to people, look at this. It's probably fine, Nick is always really careful about the places we stay. All right. All right, come on, let's go. Watch your step there. Torch sticks we'll get to you. All right, the kitchen's on the right, rooms in the back. There's a downstairs in case you need some peace and quiet while you're working, it's got a nice view of the woods. Great, did you get the water hooked up? Yes sir, I got you hooked up to the well out back. Now the AC acts up a little bit but it works. - You guys are all set in here. - Thank you. Thank you so much. What the fuck are you looking at? What, what the fuck are you talking about? Chase, go wait in the truck. Seriously? I apologize for my nephew. That's all right, do we still have full access to the woods like we discussed? Oh, yes sir. Did any of the people who went missing stay in this cabin? I don't know about missing. Some of 'em have gotten lost. So you don't believe in the witch? Look these tourists, they're people who haven't been in the woods their entire life. They come up here looking for the same haunted shit as you do. They go wandering off, they get lost in the woods, plain and simple. You can quote me on that. What's up, believers? It's your boy Jimmy here, we have arrived at the cabin. We've unpacked the gear and now we are ready to begin our quest into discovering the country's most notorious haunted forest. With 43 disappearances since the summer of 1968 and no bodies recovered, the authorities have no explanations to the disappearances within the forest. That's right but many locals believe it all began with this woman, Greta Fullmer. In the summer of 1968, she abducted and killed 13 men, women and children. And the local police found Greta dead in these woods surrounded by her 13 victims. And next to the gun that she killed herself with was a copy of the Codex Gigas, otherwise known as the Devil's Bible. Now ever since that summer, anyone who travels into these woods alone is abducted. Brendan Wallows, age 30, missing June 1978. Maggie Andrews, age 25, missing March 1983. Justin Haverdie, November 1986. Colin Smith, Mary Furrow, Jonathan Banks. Those disappearances span over the course of five decades. Right but that all ended about six months ago. Meet Nelson Morgan. Father of Casey Morgan. They were hiking together when Casey was abducted. This is big because this is the first and only documented case of an abduction in Rudwick involving two hikers, the only one. We're speaking with Mr. Morgan tomorrow to find out just what happened. I cannot wait, I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight, I'm so excited, oh my god. Well that is all we have for now believers but remember. The cameras are always rolling. What's that? Yo, shh. Oh. Right well, it would appear that we have a visitor. That was a huge bump that sounded like it came from inside the cabin. Nick. Guys? Guys? Dude, what? I heard something, it's outside. - Everything okay? - Yeah, stay right here. I swear. I don't make this up. - You see anything? - No. What was it you heard? A bump and it woke me up and then I heard a louder bump that sounded like it came from inside the cabin. So, we're outside the cabin. Yeah we're outside the cabin, I already looked into that. Then you got me out of bed for this. - I really appreciate it. - You know the next time that we're in a haunted forest with a witch, I'll let you sleep. We're not even in the forest yet, man. It wasn't the creak of the cabin. It was a deliberate thud, a bump, two of 'em. Sorry to disrupt your slumber. How do you know it wasn't me? Because your fat ass was asleep. Hey, did you leave this open? No, I didn't. Oh, that's real funny. That's hilarious. - Hey wait. - Yeah. That's the sound I was talking about. I told you, I wasn't lying to you. - All right. - Oh, now you believe me. Okay great, I'm glad I earned your trust eventually. I'm telling you, I know what I heard. That the same sound that you heard before? Yes, yes. I don't see anything down here and it sounded like a goddamn wolf. I told you, there's someone out here. I know we're running into trouble. Do you? - Do you see that right there? - Yeah, yeah. Get back! It's just a fuckin' guy who's wasted. She's here. Jimmy, go get my phone and we'll call his uncle. Hey, you shouldn't be here. Yeah, okay. Hang tight, we're gonna call your uncle to come get you. - Jimmy, what's going on? - You see Nick's phone? Yeah, what's up? This redneck's drunk nephew, he's drunk and he's here. All right Chase, hey, you had a lot to drink buddy? You don't belong here! You shouldn't a come, none of you! She might keep you. I'll keep you. All right man that's enough, it's time to go. Don't you fuckin' touch me! She's in you, she sees you. She's here huh, you shouldn't a come! You get out of here, you get out of here! - You shouldn't have come. - We got him, we got him. Dammit Chase. I'm really, really sorry about this. My nephew sometimes overdoes it. Clearly, I mean we could've called the police. And I appreciate that you didn't. I'm gonna get him outta your hair, all right? We'll be outta here, Chase? Chase, wake up man, we're gonna go home all right? One foot in front of the other here. - It won't happen again. - You need help? - No, we're used to this. - All right. - I told them... - You told 'em nothing. That they should up and leave the house? Get in the truck. You're shit-faced. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Patrick. Ooh wee. This smells like straight gasoline. Should we find another place to stay? It's not in our budget. Babe, he tried to break into the house. He was drunk, his uncle said it won't happen again. Look we're tired, it's late. Let's just go to bed and we'll try again tomorrow. - We'll be fine, I promise. - Wait, wait. - Do you guys not hear that? - Hear what? - Seriously. - What? Listen. You're such an ass. Got that. Yo. - The hell are you doing Ames? - Good morning. Well, - look. - Wow. Ooh, ah, and mom said I had no talents. Well no, mom is completely and totally wrong. Look at the eyes in the middle. - Hey! - Perfect, oh it's perfect. Sorry but I was first out here and that little guy, he's at the bottom of the totem pole. Hey Jimmy, are you ready for this interview? I really want you to press this guy hard. Yeah man, that's what I do, I always bring it. Trying to decide what I wanna wear, you know? I'm thinking about going a little skimpy, you know? - Showing a little leg. - Get your foot off the table. It's what the people want to see. People do not want to see that. Sorry, I'm just gonna give it to 'em. Hey real quick, gimme some of that. Get your hands off, get your own, mooch. What about you, are you ready for this? Yeah, I've done this a million times. Yeah, I know. I just, I really want to do this one right, you know? We need to start this series off with a bang and we really spent a lot of money on this new camera. Babe, babe. We're gonna be great, okay? What time's this guy supposed to be here man? Five minutes ago, so. You think he's gonna be a no-show? I hope not, he's kinda pivotal to our case. He probably would be, probably he's pretty unreliable. Wait. Wait, I think that's him. - That's the guy? - Yeah, over here. That's William? Yeah okay, so this is the Park Ranger. He was the one that was on duty for Casey, right? So how long were you a Park Ranger then? Seven years. And what, you just up and decided you wanted to quit six months ago? - Oh yeah. - That was around the same time Casey Morgan disappeared. That was the last straw for me. I don't know what they're trying to cover up with these woods but I don't want to have any part of it. So you do believe that Nelson's daughter was taken by something supernatural? Uh-huh, I mean look, I know Nelson. He's an absolute fuck-up, that's undeniable but to think he had anything to do with his daughter's disappearance, no. I mean that little girl was his whole life. Okay. Why then are the Park Rangers going through so many lengths to cover up these missing bodies? - I mean it doesn't make... - It's the revenue. This place brings in tourists, it creates jobs. I mean listen, when I was first hired as a Park Ranger and I went through training, they told me explicitly never to patrol the woods alone. So you think that that's because all the people who disappeared, they were abducted while they were hiking by themselves? Absolutely. Absolutely, my partner did not want to talk about it but they were real. So did you hear voices, did you see something? Once. What did you see? - My mother. - Okay. You saw your mother in the forest? What the hell did she say, what'd you do? Did you chase after her, talk to her, what? - No. - Why the hell not? My mother's been dead for 10 years. - Hey hey, Nelson. - Hi. Hey, I'm Jimmy. Yep great, yeah. - This is my sister Amy. - Hi, nice to meet you. Thank you for coming to see us, Mr. Morgan. Up there, that's Nick. He's the fella you spoke to on the phone, up there. So did you find the place okay? Okay. Okay well, we don't want to waste your time Mr. Morgan. So why don't you follow me into the room and we'll do the interview upstairs, okay? - Just right this way. - Yeah please, after you. Do I say my name into there? Yeah yeah, right there, whenever you're ready man. My name is Nelson Morgan, I am 47 years old and I am of sound mind and body. Yeah, that's perfect. Great Nelson, what we'll do here today is we'll just talk a little bit, okay? We'll get to know you a little bit, ask you a few questions if that's okay. Yeah, okay. Let's start with the morning of Casey's disappearance. Now what brought you to Rudwick in the first place? Casey loves nature. I get her one weekend a month, so we tend to spend a lot of time outside together. You were recently divorced, right? - Yeah. - If you don't mind me asking, what was the cause of the separation, Nelson? I'm sorry, what does that have to do with anything? Well we were just... You're the psychic. Psychic is a strong word. I was actually hoping that you could help me find her. If you could contact her, help me find her. That's not really how it works. Listen Nelson, I understand that this can be really painful to relive all the details of what happened. However we do have a lot of questions that need answering, okay? Now the first of which is this. The police report said you waited eight hours to contact them after Casey went missing. Nelson, why would you wait so long? I was searching for her. She's my daughter, I'm not gonna leave her out there by herself. And the police report also said that you were drunk. - I wasn't drunk... - You weren't drunk with Casey or you weren't drunk at the police station? - I'm confused. - No, I wasn't drunk. I had been searching for a few hours. I had a bottle of whiskey in the trunk of my car. I had a few sips to take the edge off. I was scared, I had just lost my daughter. Sure I get that, now but do you remember an incident six months ago when Child Services were called to your house? I came here so you could help me find her. Not for you to judge me based on one neighbor who couldn't mind her business. I get that Nelson but you've gotta understand we have a job to do. We have to check our due diligence, you get that don't you? Yeah. I need your help. I need you to help me to convince her to come home. Wait, what do you mean convince her to come home? - She's still out there. - Wait. You still think that she's out there alive? I know she is, I talk to her. Nelson, where do you talk to her? What do you guys think? I mean, he obviously believes in what he's seeing but he's definitely troubled. Troubled? This guy is out of his fucking mind, are you kidding me? Nick, you sure this guy's reliable? - Are you shitting me? - He seemed fine on the phone. Oh, on the phone he seemed fine. Guys, he's not well. He's distressed. Distressed. I don't know, I think he's hiding something. I just don't know what it is. I know what it is, stars that bite. Stop it. I have a sixth sense about this, this guy's fuckin' nuts. Hey, hey. This is where I usually see her. - Where, over here? - Yeah. Okay. How long do you normally wait for her? As long as it takes. As long as it takes, well, we'll just wait. Got nothing else to do, right? We'll just wait as long as it takes I guess. Today, tomorrow, it's all the same, whatever. We gotta go, we gotta get outta here. Jimmy stop, give him a chance. He lost his daughter, he's distressed. We'll give it a little time and then we'll go, okay? Casey? Casey baby, come on out. It's okay baby, come here. I've brought people that are gonna help. I love you, baby. Casey! We gotta go, we shouldn't push it. Come on out, baby. How much longer do you want to stand out here? I just, I don't know how to get him to leave. Casey I love you. I brought some people that can help, okay baby? It's all right. Just tell him we're leaving. Whatever it is he thinks is out here isn't coming. Come on out baby, daddy loves you, it's okay. Okay. Hey Nelson. - She's coming. - I know but it's late. She's coming, Casey it's all right baby. I'm right here, I'm right here. It's just getting really late. Why don't we try tomorrow, okay? No I just, I want, I want her to come out, I want her to come home but she just, she just stands there. Okay, well we've been out here for hours so... Casey baby, I love you so much. Maybe we just come back tomorrow and... - I can't do this anymore. - Oh my god, no! No, oh my god Nelson, Nelson please listen. Don't do that, don't do that Nelson. - It's not gonna stop. - But you don't know that. It's not gonna stop, I do know. Nelson, look at me Nelson, Nelson, Nelson, okay. Maybe I can help, okay? Hey Nelson, maybe I can help. Okay maybe I was wrong, I was wrong earlier. Maybe I can help, can I see the picture again? Please can I see the picture again? - You can help? - I think so. You can help, you can bring her home? I need you to put the gun down, okay? I can't, no no, please, please Nelson. Nelson, gimme the gun. I can help if you give me the gun, okay? No please, please no. I can't event hold this anymore, please, please. I love you so much. I just want you to come home. Yeah I got him in the car, we'll put him under a mandatory suicide watch for the next 48 hours. Okay, does he have any family in the area, somebody that could help him? No no, but we've dealt with him in the past. He usually cools down after a few days. - So he's done this before? - Not to this extreme. But he's out here in the woods all the time, he's usually drunk. He's one of our regulars in the tank. But since you won't be pressing charges, I think I have everything I need from you. - Thank you, Officer. - Thanks. - Y'all take care. - You too. - I can't believe that. - Yeah, I know. I got all that on camera. I did, what? What? Oh yo Nick, where's Amy? - What? - Where's Amy? She's outside on the porch. I hate the bugs. Hey weirdo, what are you doing? I'm just trying to wrap my mind around today. Oh yeah, want some company? Are you my only option? Oh you're so funny, oh yeah. Let's set this thing up here. Thanks. Nah, I'm good. It's pretty much all backwash now anyway. It's so creepy. You're like a paranormal bloodhound or something. Do you remember when we found that well in the woods by grandma's house? Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I still am trying to wrap my brain around how you convinced me to go down there. - You were so scared. - Yeah, I was so scared because we got stuck in a well at night. We were like a real life episode of Lassie, it's not funny. Oh my god. Do you remember what we saw? No one believed us. You know, sometimes I just wonder if it's all in my head, you know? Oh my. I found something. I was reviewing some of the footage of when we were out in the woods with Nelson. - And? - Put these on. - Okay. - Okay, so you know how when he was calling for his daughter, all we heard was crickets? - Yeah yeah, nothing at all. - Listen to the audio. - What? - Oh my god. - Yeah. - What? - Here. - Listen. - You heard it? - Yeah. And you found this just now reviewing the footage? - Mm hmm. - Holy shit, are you serious? - You like that? - Oh my god, this is insane. And it just continues like that the whole time we were out there, right up until we left. Can we plug this into the camera? - Yeah man. - Fuckin' do it. All right. All right guys, so we were reviewing the footage from earlier today in the woods with Nelson and we heard this. Casey. - Casey baby, come on out. - Children. Fuckin' children laughing in the woods the whole time. - It's okay baby, come here. - Fuckin' unbelievable man. Hey non-believers, we are just getting warmed up, I promise you that. - This is unreal. - This is incredible. Yes, it's fuckin' incredible, we found ghosts. We found some ghosts, we're gonna be famous. I'm gonna be famous, that's the most important part. I'm gonna be famous! What was that? Okay so, it's 3:02 a.m and well, I just heard children laughing outside my window. Children. This place is fuckin' creepy, I love it. All right, better get going. Here we go. So, it's pretty quiet now but I definitely heard something. I swear I heard something walking. How y'all doing tonight? - Jimmy. - Ames? Ames? Are you out here? - Jimmy. - What, Amy? Amy? What are you doing? Amy! Amy! Oh shit. What are you doing, Ames? What the fuck are you doing, what are you looking at? What are you doing, your nose Ames, are you okay? - I saw her. - You saw who? Casey. What? Ames. Just take a seat here. Are you okay? - I'll go get Nick. - No just, just get me a wet rag to wipe the flood off my face. All right. Hey, how did you know the daughter was out there anyway? I thought it was a dream at first and then suddenly I was outside. I saw Casey and I blacked out. Nelson was right, something else is out here. - Hey, don't tell Nick okay? - What? Just he's got a lot on his plate and I don't want him to worry about me. We need to tell Nick. I mean he's gonna see this footage... Just wait until after, okay? Every time I get like this, he freaks out and I don't want to leave, do you? Are you kidding me? Hell no. This is it, I mean this is where we prove that we're not crazy. You're not crazy. The camera lens and the battery lights. There we go, check, check, check. Got enough water and food for three days. - Yep. - And I have a flashlight. Let's go find ourselves a witch. Perfect, let's go. So what happens baby sister when our show is a massive success and the band breaks up because Nick back here can't handle my rise in fame, what then? Is this gonna be before or after you burn out on drugs and booze, huh? Well if that was to happen, it's fine. I'll just find me one of those holistic rehab places and play with the horses and goats and everything all day long. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Dream big baby bro, have big goals for yourself. When are those execs sending over the final contracts? - It's been almost two weeks. - Yeah. Yeah their lawyers are looking over them, that's what they said. They said that they had to review the fine print. That's what they told you is that they're having their lawyers review the fine print? That's what they said, you know how this lawyer shit goes man. No one really knows but that's what they said. - So we'll hear something soon. - Great. - You want Fritos, babe? - Sure, thanks. Here you go Jimmy. Thank you. - Can I have some of that? - Oh yeah, here. Thanks. Sun Chips, eh? Shit, shit, shit. What's wrong? I forgot my pills back at the cabin. What? It's fine, I took one this morning. It's just for one night, we'll be back tomorrow. - No, we need to turn back. - Yep, that's fine. - No, it's okay. - No no no, fuck that. We are not going back. We've been walking for hours, we are not going back. What if she has another seizure out here in the middle of nowhere? Will you guys stop please? I hate when you guys talk about me like I'm not here and hey babe okay, I'm gonna be fine, it's just one night. Like I said, I took one this morning. It's fine. I've gone longer without 'em and been fine, okay? And you, thanks for looking out for my well-being. Sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine guys, okay? This is it. - Here you go. - Ooh, thank you. All right, looks like the GoPros are all set up and the motion capture cameras are all ready to go around the campsite and we have a full battery charge. Very good, let's just now hope that it doesn't turn into another Connecticut. Temperatures dropped below freezing like every night. Yeah that and plus we didn't get anything the whole time. Hey, I tried to convince us to go but you wouldn't listen. Yeah I know, I know. Let's just hope tonight's a little different. Let's buckle up, it's gonna be good. So it's 3:00 a.m. Amy and Nick are already asleep. I haven't seen anything yet. I'm hoping tomorrow is a different story and all this isn't for nothing. I think I just heard something. I don't know what it was but I definitely heard something. Holy shit. - What the fuck? - Hey, we got something. - What is it? - We're not sure yet. Motion sensor cameras aren't picking anything up. Well all right, now I got a picture. - Jimmy, you ready? - Fuckin' ready, man. - Jimmy. - Get over here. - What is it? - Shh. Listen. Casey, Casey are you there? Casey, it's okay. We're here to help, we're friends of your dad's. Casey? Damn, I think she's gone. Let's get this footage uploaded to the laptop. What, I mean damn, are you serious? Guys, she wants to make contact. Hey Nick, how long's it gonna take to download this shit man? It should be ready to go by morning. - I'm gonna need your SD card. - Yeah yeah, hold on. So woke up this morning after a great night's sleep to a little surprise I guess you could say. These things are everywhere. I don't even know what the fuck they are. Nick's reviewing the footage to find out how they got here. Hopefully we'll see that but that's not the only surprise we had. Ames, what the hell? What is this? It looks like an upside down cross. Fuckin' A-awesome it is. No no no, this can't be happening. - What's going on? - It's corrupted. - What is? - The footage. All the footage from last night. What? - No, no, that can't be true. - Yeah okay, okay. - Great time to joke... - It's just black and static. Look. - Did you check both SD cards? - Yes, I did. Wait wait wait, what about the audio? There's nothing, it's like we didn't even turn the cameras on. Fuck. - All right. - Damn. All right. What's our battery situation like? At 50%. Okay, so we can stay out here another night. No. Why the hell not, Nick? Amy doesn't have her meds. We don't have enough footage, Nick. We have plenty of footage. - We can use what we got from... - It's not fuckin' enough. - I'm telling you. - Calm down. No listen, I'm calm, we don't have enough Nick. Stop being a pussy, let's stay another night. I'm not gonna risk Amy's health for more footage, all right? We can go back to the cabin and we'll come back out here. Oh yeah because this shit, this shit happens all the time right? Hey, it is fine. No, it's not fuckin' fine Amy. Jimmy, what is going on? Look. The A&E contracts, they haven't been signed. Yeah because you said the lawyers were reviewing them. No, it's because they don't fucking exist. - What? - Yeah. I mean the execs said that they weren't signing off on any projects until we got them a pilot. You said this was a done deal, Jimmy. Yeah I know what the fuck I said, Nick. - You lied to us? - Yeah, I lied to us. But look we can get this, all right? - And we can capitalize... - You're fuckin' unbelievable! No, I'm not fuckin' unbelievable Nick. Get off your high horse. I'm the reason we have this opportunity in the first place... If you had told me that this was contingent on a pilot being made, then we could've rented this equipment instead of buying it and we could've gotten better tents... Drag our feet, right? Drag our feet, slow down, take our time, yeah. Okay, that's enough. Jimmy, that was really fucked up what you did. You should have told us. Yeah, I should've but I didn't okay? Yeah. That's where we're at. - Fuck. - You know what, fine. I will go back to the cabin and I will get the meds. No no no, I don't want you going alone. - It's too dangerous. - Okay yeah, so look. We all have a say in this, right? Let's put it to a vote. - I say we stay. - We need to leave. Of course you do. Ames? I think we should stay. Amy, this isn't some easy project... I know that it's not, hey, hey, please. I know that you're worried and I am fine. But Jimmy's right, this is the only chance we have to prove ourselves, to prove that we're not hacks, that I am... Please say something. This is what you want? Yes. All right. - All right. - Thank you. Shit. Fuck. What do you think you're doing? - Getting some water, man. - No. Get some out of your own pack. I don't fuckin' have any, man. Then walk back to the cabin and get some from there. - Real fuckin' mature. - Yeah, real mature? You wanna talk about real mature, Jimmy? How about all this shit that you just pulled out here on us? - I said I was sorry... - Guys please. Can we just stop? It's over. Are you okay? - Yeah, it's just my stomach. - Do you need anything? Nick, did you get a chance to check those recorders to make sure... Yeah they're fine Jimmy, they were fine last night. Jeez, I don't need an attitude. - Fuck you, Jimmy. - There we go, blame me. - You always do. - Yeah. Of course I'm gonna blame you. If you hadn't pulled the shit you did, we wouldn't be in this situation right now, all right? This is entirely your... It's okay, it's okay, it's all right. Get it all out. You're okay. - I need to lie down. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. - Is she all right? - You got it? Yeah. Is she okay? She's just bad off those pills, man. Yeah it's not just the pills man, it's this fuckin' place. Man, I'm sorry about those contracts. I really am, it's my fault. Maybe someday you'll grow up. Here's to you, witch. Hey. Hey, did you hear that? She's here. Amy. Oh god Amy, okay. Jimmy. Is there nothing we can do? There's nothing we can do until it passes. It's been over an hour, man. It's never been this long or this bad before. Maybe she just needs some rest, you know? No, she needs her meds, she needs her meds. - I'll go get her meds. - You can't, man. It's like she said, it's too dangerous to go alone. I know man but she needs 'em, she does. You just go, you run, you don't stop for anything all right? And then you just get those pills and come right back here. Yeah. Fuckin' Monster Energy. Please Jimmy, please help me. Amy? Please Jimmy, please help me, hurry. She's coming. Come on Jimmy, get it together. What the hell? What the hell was that? Jimmy, Jimmy help. - Nick! - Jimmy, please! Jimmy, Jimmy! Amy! Nick! No, get away! No! Leave me the fuck alone, get away! Leave me alone! - What the fuck is this shit? - Jimmy! I need help, I need your help. - It's Nick. - What happened? I need your help, I can't carry him, please. Please Jimmy hurry, please! - Fuck. - Jimmy, please. - What the fuck? - Jimmy hurry. Amy? What the fuck, where's Nick? What the fuck happened, where's Nick? You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me, man.
