- [Voiceover] In 1864, during the American Civil War, Union General, William T. Sherman, began his famous march to the sea. With an army of 60,000 men, he swept into the South, destroying Atlanta, Georgia, Columbia, South Carolina, and dozens of smaller towns. His troops plundered homes, destroyed livestock, burned buildings and left a path of destruction 60 miles wide and 700 miles long, before finally forcing a Confederate surrender in North Carolina. Sherman's campaign marked the first time in modern history that total warfare had been waged on a primarily civilian population and traces of the scars he left on the South can still be found. - [Voiceover] Great, do you want to do it once more, just - [Voiceover] Do it over, yeah [clearing throat]. - [Voiceover] Two years ago I was about to begin shooting a documentary film on the lingering effects of Sherman's march on the South. I'm from the South and all through my childhood I heard stories about how Sherman had devastated the South. My aunt even keeps a sofa in her attic, which is punctured by sword holes put there by Sherman's soldiers as they searched for hidden valuables. She says she'll never allow the holes to be sewn up. Anyway, I'd just gotten a grant to make my film and I stopped off in New York, from Boston, where I live, to stay for a few days with the woman I'd been seeing. But when I arrived she told me she'd just decided to go back to her former boyfriend. We argued and then I left and went to stay alone in a friend's studio loft, which happened to be vacant at the time. [swishing] Finally I headed south to see my family and to try to begin my film. [traffic rumbling] Hi sis. - Hi. - Where's dad? Oh he's way back there. He's coming. For a long time the consensus among my family members is that what I really need to do is find what they call a nice Southern girl and things will be fine. They're on vacation in the mountains of North Carolina and they've invited me to go with them to a picnic and festival. They've also invited me a number of family friends and their sons and daughters, mostly, it seems, daughters. [movie camera clicking] [giggling] - Dammit. - That's poison ivy. - [Woman] Oh no. [bagpipe music] - Hi. - [Woman] Do you want us to wave hi? [bagpipes drown out speech] - [Voiceover] I had no desire to meet or talk to any of the young women I'd been introduced to, despite every encouragement from my father. [bagpipes drown out chatter] - [Voiceover] The mere thought of trying to meet someone new depresses me. [bagpipe music] [cheering] [sharp whistling] [clapping] I spend the rest of the day watching as men compete in various demonstrations of strength and virility. [laughing] [drumming music] [mumbling chatter] [laughing] [fife and drum music] - [Man] You gotta watch his back. - [Man] Watch his back. [grunting] - [Voiceover] The next day, my sister, who is recently married, is anxious to discuss my situation with me. - The thing that makes me mad is that you're sitting here, you're not sleeping at night, you're doubting yourself, even though you, you know, your insecurity from it, and it's all due to the fact that she is involved in a situation that she wasn't happy in, it hurt her. She comes to you, you being her friend and all. She sucks you emotionally dry, which gets her through, then she's strong again because she feels, yes there's somebody that cares for me that means I'm not such a rotten person. She gets strong again. She can go back and contend with this fellow again, right? - [Voiceover] Right, but it's not that simple. She's just being honest, - Well I... she's following where she feels. I don't really-- - Well listen that's bullshit. I'm sorry but yeah, you know I could do that to Steve every time I got sick and tired of him or something, run off to somebody else and whatever, get my ego built up and then go back to him. It isn't the right thing to do. It's not the classy thing to do. People are so much, out for themselves now. - [Voiceover] No. You know it's just a woman that just wants, not being right on with you. [mumbles] But I can't understand why you can't let go of it. - [Voiceover] Well it's only been a few days. I mean, it took me a while to get over it. - Okay, well a lot of-- - [Voiceover] I'm gonna lose my confidence. - No, you think you have anything of, it really has anything to do with your lifestyle, like you were talking about? - [Voiceover] I agree. The way you dress, the way you live? I think you should tidy up a little bit. As far as, not all the time. But to least, to be able to have a choice in the matter. Do you understand what I mean? - [Voiceover] Like what? - If you were with somebody that appreciates it when a man is a little bit more dressed up, then you can swing it. See what I'm saying? - [Voiceover] My beard, do you think? - I think you should trim it, a little bit. Like Steve had his beard, do you remember? You can look kind of, neat and pleasing to the eye. Artistically. Here's a little nymphette swimming by on the left of, other side here. Going for my husband it looks like [chuckling sigh]. A little swimmer, kicking away there. [mumbles] See that kinda makes you, you have an instant rapport with people because you have a camera. At least it's something to talk, a conversation piece. - [Voiceover] I'll try to think of it that way from now on. - You should. Because everybody's always, everybody here is watching you. They think this is PM magazine. You know? Keep the faith. I feel like a celebrity. - [Voiceover] You are now. For the next few days I ponder my sister's suggestion that I try to be more outgoing with my camera and that I think of it as a way of perhaps meeting someone new. A few days later I learn that a childhood sweetheart of mine, someone I haven't seen in 20 years, happens to be modeling at a local fashion show and I discuss the matter with Ann, my step-mother. - Who is she's with? Is she married or? - [Voiceover] No she's in a fashion show. - We're going to that today. - [Voiceover] Can I go with you? - Sure, sure, sure. - [Voiceover] Can I come? That's amazing, I didn't know that. - It's part of this weekend, entertainment. [crowd chattering] - [Woman] This is so comfortable. - Is it really? - [Woman] You wouldn't believe it. Yeah, it's wonderful, it really is. - [Ann] Well it is pretty. - Thank you, thank you. - [Voiceover] She's not married. - [Ann] No. I don't think I've weighed that little since I was in the third grade. I know I haven't. - [Ann] Tell me about the dress. - This is [crowd drowns out speech]. You know I do not know what this is but it's like an [mumbles]. It has a lot of body to it, I just think it's cute. - [Woman] It looks great on you. - Thank you. - [Woman] Certainly everyone couldn't wear it. - Thank you. - [Woman] Very pretty. [girl gasping] [women laughing] - Oh Ross! - [Voiceover] How are you? Oh I'm so glad to see you! - [Voiceover] I know, I didn't know you-- - [Model] Oh, just where have you been. [laughing][mumbles] to set in Ross. Ross! - [Ross] It's wonderful to see you again. - Well thank you, I'm glad to see you too. What are you doing? - [Ross] I'm filming. - [laughing] For what purpose? - [Ross] I'm making a film about Sherman's march to the sea. [laughing] Let me talk to you later on. - Okay. - [Ross] I don't want to interrupt your business, but it's been wonderful to see you again. Thank you, I'm glad to see you too. I do want to talk to you, okay? - [Ross] Okay, [mumbles] bye bye. - [Ann] Did you think she's married, or? - No she's not. - [Ann] She's not? - Not now. - She's a doll, I'd ask her out. She's gonna be here. - [Ross] We used to play Superman together. That's what I remember, do you remember that? - Uh huh, in the backyard. - [Ross] We'd put towels on. - Uh huh [laughing] - Around, as capes around. - And my seven year old still does that, I mean that is his favorite thing, to be somebody else. - [Ross] I know, and now all the movies are coming out with Superman, it's all a cycle. It's amazing. - Somehow Christopher Reeves. [laughing] - [Ross] Yeah right. - Looks pretty good Ross, I might like to go play Superman with him sometime. - [Ross] Don't you think I look enough like Superman? - [laughs] Well. - [Ross] What if I shave the beard off? It might help. - That might help, that might help. But I like your beard. - [Ross] Thank you. I would say I like yours too but you don't have one. - Well my 11-year-old looked at me the other night in front of my date and said, "Oh Mom, you've got a mustache." [laughs] That was awful. Not one of the things you want your child to do in front of your date. - [Ross] That's great. So are you involved with somebody? Do you see somebody on a regular basis? - No just kinda, fightin' free right now. This was, it was like, I don't believe in divorce. You know, I feel like once you get married you hang in there so this has, not been real pleasant. - [Ross] I'm sure it hasn't. The next day Mary has to leave, and I go to say goodbye. - [Mary] Bye. - [Ross] Bye. For a long time I've had this notion that love was possible. I mean romantic love, you know, two people falling deeply in love with each other and somehow managing to stay together for more than two weeks. But time after time it seems that a woman would get involved with me and want some sort of commitment and I would decide that it wasn't right, or vice versa. And no matter how passionate things were in the beginning there was never any equilibrium and nothing ever seemed to last. At any rate I find myself slipping back into listless contemplation of my single status. But Ann, my stepmother, has made other plans for me. - [Ann] She grown up and been raised in this house. You gonna love her, but. This lady is from Salisbury, and, what are you grimacing about? - [Ross] I'm not grimacing. - Yeah. - [Ross] I'm not. I have to squint sometimes. - Oh, okay. No but, I think she's attractive, she's good looking, she sounds very smart. - [Ann] This is Ross by the way. - [Ross] By coincidence, she's the same woman I've already filmed, swimming in the lake. And later, rollerskating. Her name is Pat, and she's visiting her parents but she lives in New York City where she's been trying to find work as a movie actress. We have a few drinks and take in the musical entertainment. And then she asked me to film her doing her cellulite exercises. And I agree to do so, although I'm not exactly sure what cellulite is. - Actually this is supposed to get rid of the cottage cheese on the back of your legs, like this. See the cottage cheese? - [Ross] Yeah, that's the cellulite? - Yeah. - [Ross] Show me these exercises. - Okay. Let's see, I do them like there if I had on some underpants. - [Ross] I believe you. - Actually it's harder than it looks. You gotta just keep going up and down. - [Ross] Here, for some reason, I accidentally turn off my tape recorder. It's three in the morning and I can't sleep. I keep wondering how I should've responded to Pat's comment about not wearing any underpants. I mean, that's not like telling someone that you're not wearing any socks. Also I've begun having my dreams about nuclear war again. I hardly ever think about nuclear war during the day, but during certain times of my life I'll dream about it for several nights in a row. When I was 12 I happened to have seen a hydrogen bomb test. An atmospheric test over the Pacific that was one of the most powerful ever detonated. It was actually the eve of my 13th birthday and I can remember some friend of my father's telling me it was a huge birthday candle that Uncle Sam was lighting in my honor. Anyway, I think that explosion probably has something to do with my war dreams. But I found that these dreams also seemed to be directly linked to the relative happiness or unhappiness of my love life. When things are going well for me, the missiles gather dust in their silos but when things are going badly they take to the skies by the thousands, night after night. How are you today? - Definitely a lot better now that I've been swimming. So then, I figure this'll be the beginning of my screenplay. So that's the first scene in my screenplay. Just me and Brady Smith, I'll have braids on, a plaid shirt, the whole thing. - [Ross] You'll have to give me a compressed version because I'll never-- - So that's how it starts out, then I turn into the best actress in the world. Probably with some huge love scene, comparable to Romeo & Juliet, something that captivates the whole world, the heart of the world. Now by the fact I'm such a famous actress, I'm a multimillionaire and move to an island in the south seas, with my lover who's gonna be Tarzan to me. And we just play Jane and Tarzan and then about three years later, we build a center, which will have seven or eight centers coming out from, we'll have another island, with a center. And this will be the most intellectual island in the world, full of the top scientists we'll cure cancer, et cetera. I come back and I've found all these scientific things possibly cure cancer myself. Come back, now wait a minute while I'm on the island though, my Tarzan lover, who's name is Will, he has a fit because he no longer has me to himself so he throws a fit burns down the island, it's totally built on all the scientific research. And at this point in the movie I want it to be total fantasy, just like, tropical, huge, huge plants, huge animals, The music will be just unbelievable. Probably Stevie Wonder's type of music. Secret life of plants. - [Ross] How old are you at this point? - At this point, pretty much ageless because I've been an astronaut. So I haven't really aged, and this is another thing that overwhelms people is that I'm this person who's really never really aged. And so we go to Venus, and we start coming back and forth to Earth and we start teaching people flying lessons because the gravity's different so, therefore, we can build our muscles up, like breaststroke, and we come back and forth, well I get in a huge fight with Will on Venus and he takes a sword and cuts my head off, and my head floats back to the Malibu mountains, in California and I give this speech and a this point I'm the female prophet. And I give this speech to the whole world who's lined up on all the Los Angeles beaches, all on the mountaintop, and all they see is my head, floating. And it's just totally, gets to the whole world. And my message is one of love. - [Ross] I've ever met anyone quite like Pat, and I confess to feeling a strong, how shall I put it, primal attraction to her. I continue to film Pat as she goes about her daily activities. - He's been, in a mental institution lately. So, you know, the whole thing is based on you have the will to change or not, He still hasn't made up his mind to do it. Which is, not really great for my part because I, I'm not gonna give him much longer. - [Ross] Do you live together? - Sometimes. I met him out on the Santa Monica Pier. - [Ross] Aha, it all fits together. - But he's-- - [Ross] Do your parents know about him? - Oh yeah, they know but, see he, God if this is really taped or something he could sue me for this. But like he's-- - [Ross] Don't say anything he could sue you for. I can't afford it. [laughing] - No I love him, but I also hate him. - [Ross] That's been know to happen. - He's a brilliant person who's wasting his brain. Is what it is. And that upsets me, because I hate to see that happen to anybody. - [Ross] So that's why your parents, are linking up with my parents, to put us together I think. - You think so? - [Ross] I think that's what they're-- - I've already said to your parents "Oh I'll marry him," and they said "No, no, he's a poor filmmaker." [laughing] - [Ross] They're not doing me justice. - No. [laughs] Well, it was the first night they haven't asked me what time I got in. No, I'm just-- [laughs] - [Ross] They trust me. Let's go this way. - Oh you want me to come up here? - [Ross] Sure, can you make it? - Pat's family seems to like me a lot. Probably because they think of me as a nice, Southern boy. They frequently invite me to dinner and take Pat and me on excursions and trips. - [Man] How about some spinach? I believe I'd rather have some of that. - You have two major loves in your life, you've already had one, and that person you probably met about age, 18. The next person you're gonna have-- - [Man] Where does that show up? - is in your late 30's, maybe early 40's. And that could be a teacher, but it's usually is a love life, but it could be a mentor, or such type situation. You're real disciplined. Very, very disciplined. See how straight your thumb is? Look at mine, how it curves around. You can't even do that. Can you see that? - [Ross] Let me see yours again. - See mine, really, see how mine curves down? And, oh God, you could, if you really were weak you could really be a drug addict. I'm serious, you could be a an alcoholic or drug addict, 'cause he has that sign here. - It's just the curve. - [Ross] You're in love with Will and you say that he's impossible, he beats you, he throws fits. - He doesn't beat me. No he really doesn't beat me. - [Ross] Hangs you out the window. - He pushes me around, and he's threatened to throw me out of the sixth floor window of my apartment, twice. I mean I don't have a bruise from it. - [Ross] Well why do you put up with it, I don't understand. - Because he has my heart. I have, I, that's the only reason. And I hope that, because he's such a brilliant person he'll finally come through in life and so, I keep waiting. - [Ross] And how long have you been with him? - Two years. - [Ross] Two years. This morning, Pat finally gets a call from an agency, asking her to come to Atlanta for an audition to interview. She's also recently met a contact to the actor Burt Reynolds, who happens to spend much of his time in Atlanta, and Pat has decided to try to find Mr. Reynolds in hopes of furthering her career. - I've really have honestly thought that I think the man will fall in love with me. I really say that. He may think I'm nothing but, a real twerp when he meets me and that's what Chris thought of me when he first met me, he thought, what a little twerp. And Burt Reynolds may think that about me, but he also may really fall in love with me. I'm not saying I'm gonna fall in love with him on a sexual basis, but he will fall in love with me and I will fall in love with him. Like we're seriously, I'm not trying to sound - [Ross] No, no. - But just really like brothers and sisters, really I mean that, I really mean that. - [Woman] How are you gonna get your ticket to Atlanta, honey? [smooching] Pat, how you gonna pay for your ticket? [laughing] Huh? - [Pat] I don't know. - [Woman] You are the biggest mess. - [Pat] Aw, Mama don't cry. - [Woman] It makes me sick! You just have your life so in disorder it just kills me. It really does. It just does, it really does. - Huh? I didn't do that to her, she brings that on herself. - [Man] Y'all get on outta here. [laughing] - [Ross] We better go Pat. - [Girl] Bye. - [Pat] Let me go kiss her. She does that all the time. Every time I leave. She does. You pay a price for being a female prophet. - [Ross] We make it to Atlanta and Pat and I are staying with Lee, a friend of Pat's from high school, who's also pursuing an acting career. - Hi, Jim Wittington told me that I could call you. You know Jim? Okay, the reason is is I'm an actress, in New York City but I'm from Salisbury, Virginia. And he told me that you have contacts to Burt Reynolds movies. So you do personally know him yourself? Great, and so like you've already been in some of his movies? Well is there any way like I could meet you so you'd know who you were talking to? Because I really would love to get in one of his movies. I mean, I really would. And I know like, or if you're real busy, you're real busy today, I couldn't come out and just visit you for like five minutes? Yeah, okay, thanks a whole lot. Bye bye. [sighs] [laughs] - [Ross] Undismayed by their setback, Pat and Lee prepare for their audition interviews. [classical music] - Lee. - [Lee] Huh? - You better start getting out here and getting ready. - What image do I want to come across as? - [Pat] Angie. - Angie Dickerson? - [Lee] Burt's in town you know. - Is he? - [Lee] Baccarat. - Oh. - [Lee] Not Reynolds. - [laughing] Fooled you. [blowing nose] - We'll see you in a few minutes, bye. Okay. - [Pat] What'd she say? - Hon, just come. - [Pat] We're a little late. - Okay. Bye Magnolia, goodbye. - Good luck to both of you! - [Pat] Oh thanks. - Oh gosh. - [Ross] You guys are gonna be really late, come on. - [Lee] Yeah come on, let's go. [singing] - [Pat] Hey hold this, hold this. - [Lee] I'm locking the car, do you want anything? I just think I am. - Do you think my hair looks too scraggly? - [Ross] What? - Do you think my hair looks? - [Ross] No I think it's okay. - [Pat] Thinking I'm coming in with wet hair. - [sighs] Well. - [Pat] Do you think it looks too scraggly? Do you think my hair looks too scraggly? - It was five minutes of his time type thing. I don't think I made a very good impression. - You never know Lee. The only reason I was there long was cause I asked him so many questions. I really did. He told me that I looked like his girlfriend. Can you believe that? I said, "What looks like it?" He said, "Your face, your hair." So I said, "Well are you in love?" And then he probably thought I was trying to pick him up. - [Lee] No. - No really cause I said, "Well are you in love?" He said, "No not really, you can't be "in love if you're in this business." - Well did he say anything like he would keep you in mind, or? - [Pat] He said see you later, and I looked at him like you better. And he said, "You're, you know, Brooke Shields" and I said, "God, people tell me that all the time "and I just can't wait to be cast as her older sister." He said, "You couldn't even be cast "as her older sister." He said, "maybe two or three years older." He said, "But not much." I said, "Well, what do you think about a southern accent then?" He said, "Well yours isn't really that pronounced." He says, "It's not like it's Mississippi where "you can't do anything." He said, "You could do work in Atlanta "for commercials 'cause people hear that voice here "and it doesn't bug them." In other words he doesn't think it was bad. It's limiting, but everybody's limited. You're never gonna be able to play a, exotic beauty. 'Cause they're dark-haired, Chinese looking. - [Ross] A week has passed and there's still no news from the agency. There's nothing to do but kill time and wait for a phone call. The actresses stay in shape. As for me I keep thinking that perhaps I should return to my original plan to make a film about Sherman's march but I can't seem to stop filming Pat. As the days pass I begin to explore the city. Sometimes with Pat and sometimes without her. At the beginning of his campaign, Sherman ordered the bombardment of Atlanta, and after six weeks of constant shelling, the city had undergone a strange transformation. Most of those who were still alive inhabited tomb-like shelters eight feet underground, while above ground the corpses piled up because local coffin makers weren't able to keep up with the demand. All able-bodied men were off serving in the Confederate army, so the city population consisted of children and old people and women. It was the women who nursed they dying and cared for the families and literally held the city together. And it was the women who were angriest with Sherman. In a diary, one of them called Sherman the Nero of the 19th century. At any rate, Pat's agency finally calls. She's been selected to audition for a part in a bonafide Hollywood film, and we go downtown to pick up the script. - [Lee] I would really just like to do commercials, here I mean, there's a pretty big market for that. Oh you know Tab, well Tab I'd be a before but. [laughs] - There are only two lines, no three. My first line says-- - [Lee] What is it? - Janet. - [Lee] Your name's Janet? - No that's my first line. [laughs] - Oh it's Janet. You're Doctor Bock. - [Pat] Yeah. Doctor Bock. - So what are your lines? - Janet, your house is wonderful beautiful design, beautiful execution, that's another line, I'm also in love with the piano do you play, that's another line. Those are three lines. I thought I had more than three lines! What do you mean, it takes a long time to do a movie. Well mom, it takes a long time. - Well we don't know that but it might be a Stanley Kubrick. - This is for MGM, big stuff. Metro Goldwyn Mail. A lot of people, but if I get this, I'm on my way. - [Ross] This is Peachtree Creek Battleground. Located about a mile from where Pat and I are staying. Almost 6,000 soldiers died here in about two hours fighting over a piece of land not much bigger than a Little League baseball field. Now there's not much here, just a few markers. Sherman aside, I'm disconcerted to find myself in competition with the likes of Burt Reynolds and Stanley Kubrick. I've tried to persuade Pat not to forsake her starring role in my film for some bit part in a hack Hollywood epic but she's already made up her mind and tomorrow she leaves for her audition, and I realize I've become somewhat attached to her. - [Pat] Don't view. How am I gonna carry my skates? - [Ross] I don't know, what do you need roller skates for? For an audition? - [Pat] I need them. What if they say they want an athletic girl? What if they change the role on me? - [Ross] A roller skating doctor? Do you know your lines? - [Pat] Janet. Oh what a wonderful house. Beautiful design, beautiful execution. Execución. - [Ross] [mumbles] I'm not gonna have anything to film when you leave. - Why? You don't have any film? - [Ross] No no, I said I'm not gonna have anything anyone to film when you leave. I'm so used to it. - Well, you'll have to go find another starlet. - [Lee] I love you. - I love you too. - Good luck, you can do it, you're gonna do it. - I know I am. - So give me a call, let me know. - [Ross] Good luck Pat. - Bye Ross. - [Ross] Do it okay? - I will. - [Ross] Good luck. - [Lee] You can, too. Give us a call. - [Ross] Pat's flown away to her audition and then I guess back to her boyfriend and I've stayed here in Atlanta where I've gotten a motel room until I can figure out what to do next. I find that I really miss Pat after having spent so much time with her and I really don't have any idea what to do next with this film, so I'll stay here until I figure it out. This place is a real dive. The color TV set doesn't work and my bed is falling apart. They've given me two beds in fact, both of them are falling apart, but they're both huge, which I find very depressing you know, having two large, empty beds is twice as depressing as having one large empty bed. It's nights like these that I dread trying to sleep. I sometimes end up thinking about the night in Hawaii when I stood on the beach with my family and several other families, hoping to see that hydrogen bomb test. Even though it was taking place 800 miles away we'd been told that if we look hard we'd probably be able to see a glimmer of the flash on the horizon. Someone had brought a transistor radio so that we could listen to the countdown and at zero we all strained to see something but it was too far away. Literally over the curve of the Earth and I was very disappointed. Then, a few minutes later there was this second countdown. The rocket had reached its peak and suddenly even though it was 11 o'clock at night there was this white flash, which turned the sky brighter than noon. We could see the ocean sparkling for miles out to the horizon. And behind us, Honolulu was as visible as if it were broad daylight. This flash gave way to a lingering lime green, which after a minute or so faded to sort of a deep, dark red. And then finally, gradually, the stars and moon started to come back out through the redness. No one on the beach said anything. Both my life and my film seem to be in limbo. For three days I've stayed locked up in my motel room, watching reruns of Beverly Hillbillies and Love Boat. In an attempt to get things moving again, I decide to go sightseeing. - [Voiceover] With some element of surprise to Sherman's troops, now across the creek in force, a column of rebels burst from the woods and stormed with weapons. The battle was short, but desperate. - [Ross] I ride a train that goes around in a big circle. [gunshots] [Western music] There's entertainment at every stop. Unfortunately, the train breaks down. Finally during my third cable car ride of the day, I realize I have to do something. Not only have I lost Pat, but I've lost my transportation. I don't have a car of my own and I don't see how I can continue to film without one. My brother has a sports car, at home so I call him and he tells me that if I can get it to run, I can use it. My brother also make the point several times that in addition to providing basic transportation he believes the car will also do something to improve my image [engine cranking] It'll be at least a week before we can get the car to run so I call my sister who tells me that while I've been away she's had two operations. - And they cut right under the eyeball. Right under the thing there. And opened that out, and what was under there was this little fat, it was like chicken fat. And they take that out, and then they pull the skin up a little but, you know, 'cause they're not really giving you a facelift or anything it's just to remove that excess fat that's in there. And then they take hemostats and clamp it back together. - [Ross] Right. - And the whole time he was just really pushing back on my eyeball and that's why it's red eye. So I feel great, it was worth it. If you ever know anybody that's thinking about doing it. Are you thinking about doing it? - [Ross] It never occurred to me to think about it. Sometimes I think I shouldn't think about stuff like that because it doesn't, it's not very productive but-- - [Ross] Well, but you feel better psychologically after those things. - What, about my eyebags you mean? - [Ross] Yeah, what was the other operation you had? - I'm not gonna tell you. [laughs] - [Ross] Come on, tell me. - No you, you have to [mumbles]. [laughs] - [Ross] What difference does it make? - I know but it's just personal. It's a ladies operation. - [Ross] Well it's not obscene or anything. - No but it's close to it! [laughing] I'm not gonna tell you. Do I have to? - [Ross] Yes. - I had a, [laughs] I had a fanny tuck. [laughing] - [Ross] What the hell is a fanny tuck? - Oh Ross. - [Ross] I need a description. - Okay, well. - [Ross] They trim it, the way you trim a piece of beef? - Well, yes. It's not so much that you know, you have a fat ass like this. It's that, most people's bottom goes like this. But mine went, like that. And I think I've described it to you before, and not many men know about this but there's something that women will talk about, is if you can put one or two pencils up under there, and stand there and they don't fall out then you have, you know you're gonna be in trouble. Well I could put a medium-sized tub of Crest toothpaste there and it didn't fall out. And so that's when I decided that it was time to get something done about this. - [Ross] Well that might be handy. - Well if I was a smuggler maybe. - [Ross] My sister is still determined to help me meet women and she's invited me to brunch with her friend Claudia who's an interior designer, and who's recently divorced. - [Ross] You gonna get an eyebag job too? - [Sister] Listen Claudia's crazy. - I'm gonna have total reconstruction. [laughing] - [Ross] [mumbles] the self. - Ross I'll teach you how to skate if you find some skates. - [Ross] Okay. - [whispering] She can't skate either. [laughing] - All you have to do is get a big pillow and some cord and tie a big pillow around your butt. [laughing] And then, I'll go on the side of you and just pull you and Jeepie can get behind you and push you. [laughing] If you could just get your feet going you can do it, right? - [Sister] Right. - Then we'll work on your speed and your form and your style and all later right? - [Ross] You know I haven't skated since I was about eight years old. - It'll all come back to you it's just like riding a bicycle or making love, you never forget. If you've done it once you can do it again. - [Girl] Mom. After you put on your mascara, take this little comb thing and run through your eyelashes and that takes out the big clumps. - It does, how do you know that? - No not that brush but the comb. - This? - Yeah, the comb. The brush is to shape your eyebrows. - Well I don't, here. - [Girl] See it took it some out. - [Claudia] What it is I need is some new mascara. - [Ross] We're just gonna go buy roller skates though. - Yeah I know we are but this is how I am all the time I go to work, I don't go anywhere or do anything unless I feel like I look right. - [Ross] Claudia reminds me of the girls I knew growing up, and going to school in the South. She's the girl I had a crush on in the 5th grade, and she's my assigned dance partner at teen cotillion dance class. And on Rebel Yell day, she's a cheerleader. The one I want to ask to the prom but can't because she's going steady with the tight end. While my car is being repaired I pass time with Claudia. - Now this is gonna be hilarious when I get up and try to skate. [girl shouting] - Isn't it? - [Girl] What? - Well, here goes. [laughing] Remember this is after not skating for eight or 10, 13 years, 14 years. - [Ross] Well. [laughing] - She could actually, you know, she's almost perfect, almost, right? I mean she's not really, no one is but if - [Girl] Who are you talking about? - You. - What were you saying? - We were saying that you were happy. - [Girl] You're crazy. - [Claudia] Aren't you happy right now? - [Girl] Yeah but I wish I had a friend here. - [Claudia] You wish you had a friend? - I mean my own age. You don't get up right this minute, I'm not gonna serve you breakfast! - [Friend] I'll starve. - Well get up 'cause you know if I let you sleep five minutes, you're never gonna get up! - [Friend] Oh shut up you old bag. - What? I'm not gonna let you treat me like this! - [Friend] Take it. - [Girl] He is. There's an extra egg left over. [slurping] - Well, off to work. - [Girl] Kiss me bye! [smooching] [laughing] - It doesn't look like it's coming at ya. - It looks the same. - Does it look the same? - [Claudia] Oh I see it, oh neat. Oh neat, it is 3D, oh that's great. [doleful choir singing] - Do you wanna meet him? - [Ross] Yeah I'd love to. - It's just a temporary thing there. - [Ross] Destruction of the world is a temporary thing? - That's right, it is. And this is just a temporary body. Which you have. But it's your spirit that stays alive it's not that flesh. See, that's the difference. We do have to accept the inevitable that Christ is coming again because that's a promise. - [Claudia] And not be concerned or worried over the holocaust or the destruction that's predicted but because we hopefully none of us will be be here when that even happens. - [Pastor] Then you'll be free from all the things of this world. No more worry, no more sorrow, no more pain, no more sickness, no more death. The sooner the better. - [Claudia] And then you say something about, I have not given you a spirit of fear but one of love. - And power and of a sound mind. - But one of love, - [Claudia and Pastor] and power, and of a sound mind. - [Pastor] That's 1st Timothy 1:7 [girl laughing] I believe it is. - That's 1st Timothy? - [Girl] Mom look at that. - [Claudia] There's an Easter bunny out there. - [Pastor] You've got your bible right there look at the, this is about the end of times. This Earth will be destroyed, and there will be a new Heaven and a new Earth, that's gonna come, yeah. The Antichrist will come into power, he'll have, he'll possess the powers of the devil. - [Girl] Thank you so much. [engine rumbling] - [mumbles] - Tension allen? - Yeah, now put it back on there and see what happens. - Okay great. - I bet you it'll work just great now. - [Ross] Yeah. - See you can take the steering wheel off with ya. [laughing] You can take it off with you and go anywhere you wanna go. - [Man] Take it on in the house. - [Ross] That's right. - That way nobody can steal your car. - Phillip does a lot of the work now. - [Ross] Yeah I saw him, he was doing as much as you were on my car. - Yeah oh man, he can work now. He knows what it's all about too, he like that car because see, he was only a little tiny boy you know when-- - [Ross] Oh I remember him when he was that little. - That's right, but I sold that car, let me see, when I sold that car Phil was only, '67, Phil was three years old. - [Ross] Yep, I remember he was like, you know, this tall. - That's right, at that time. - [Ross] You only have one son right? - Right. One son and one daughter now. - [Ross] That's such a shame about your daughter. - Yeah it's something, oh I'm telling you. - [Ross] Sorry to hear about that. - Yeah, but that's just one of those things that'll happen though. Yeah, I think about that girl, I miss her too. - [Ross] Yeah? - Really do, yeah. - [Ross] How did she die Phil? - She had cancer. - [Ross] Cancer. Bad, that. - That's all right. Your mother had cancer too right? - [Ross] Yeah she had cancer also. - What year was that when she passed? - [Ross] She died eight years ago. - Has it been eight years? - [Ross] Yeah, April 1st. - April 1st, eight years ago? - [Ross] Yep. [engine starting] [engine revving] - [Ross] Claudia has invited me to visit some friends of hers who live in a settlement nearby in the mountains. Her friends are giving me permission to film them but only after I promise not to reveal their names, nor the location of their settlement. - Our idea is to get people up here who have certain talents like, we were interested, we were talking to a doctor, also to a dentist, also to a veterinarian. And we have, we're dealing some property over here to a genius, in the mechanical field. Literally a genius, he can make almost anything out of anything. - Do you need any interior designers? [laughing] - [Man] Well, we'll work something out. - Are y'all building a shelter here? - Yep. What we're doing is, we're gonna use the basement down here as a fallout shelter and we're getting lead shielding, on the walls and ceiling of the basement. So we'll have the whole thing down there, we'll have a generator, water, root cellar, everything. Not to be paranoid or anything [laughs] but. - [Claudia] Just being prepared. [gunshot] - There's one left in the chamber. - [Man] I know there is. I need that for rattlesnakes. [laughing] - The kind that crawl on their belly, and the kind that walk on their feet? - [Man] Yes sir. There ain't much to do up here, you gotta make your own liquor. You got, women are kinda scarce, wouldn't you say? - [Man] Pretty ones. - Pretty ones. But it's the greatest country in the world, it really is and it makes you appreciate America and what God gave us. - It reminds you a little bit, of the America of the 30's. People up here don't realize that the world wasn't believing yet. That's the little thing they haven't yet learned. - What we are basically involved in is an isolationism, survival and going back if you will to the movie Little House on the Prairie, where the family is the dominant factor in our lives. We've gotten away from the influences and the drugs in the city. It's also freedom from regulation. You can shoot a gun off the front porch. A fella can even invite who he wants to up here and keep out who he don't. There's a lot of people wanting to survive like we do and they're coming back into the woods. And there's people who are becoming more and more conservative. I'm one of them, my sons are one of them. - [Blue Shirt] The people of our persuasion feel that the federal government is our mortal enemy. The only thing we want from governments at all levels, is to simply be left alone. Leave us alone. You better leave us alone. - You know, one of the ways to avert a nuclear war is to make ourselves so doggone powerful nuclear weapon-wise that we no longer have any fear of anybody attacking us because of the fear of retaliation. We've allowed ourselves to become weak, in our nuclear arsenal. So it's high time that this country take an isolationist viewpoint, and get on with getting itself the strongest nation in the world because you can't trust the communists. Quote, end quote. [gunshot] [gunshot] [rumbling explosion] [rumbling explosion] [gunshot] - Didn't Herbert tell you but one of them they're gonna but bass and bream in and one of them they're gonna stock with trout and I think it's that one over on that side. You'll have to ask them. And that's where they're gonna put the tennis court is right down there. - [Ross] So they'll be able to play tennis in case of a nuclear attack. - Right, they'll have everything they need up here in case of a nuclear attack to survive in style. They says after the rapture, after Jesus returns to the Earth and He takes all the believers in Christ into the heavenly spirits with Him, that there'll be a seven year period left on this Earth where all this nuclear holocaust, or fire and brimstone, and all that will, excuse me, will happen, and at the end of all this is the apocalypse. And that's the end of the world basically, and then there's a new Heaven and a new Earth that comes down from Heaven and is placed on this Earth. I truly believe that's gonna happen. - [Woman] This is Slayton Harriston who obviously in 1864 was an overseer. I really get turned on about the Civil War and I know it's been a hundred years, and I still don't think we were wrong, only in that slavery should not be enforced. It should be a right. If you wanna be a slave, be a slave. If you don't, fine. Or that Sherman was merciless, he spared nothing, he spared nobody. I'm sure in Vietnam we did the same thing. - [Claudia] Any man that would burn a city to the ground, like Atlanta, was merciless. - I'm sure we do the same thing in Vietnam, and probably worse. - We did, did you know that they have total underground cities, in Vietnam? Total underground cities in Vietnam. - You're kidding. - [Claudia] And Russia. Where they stockpile food, they carry on communications, that's why we never could win, because they had total underground cities underground and if we have a nuclear attack who's gonna survive it? The Vietnamese and the Russians. [laughing] - Well if we have a northern and a southern Civil War again, you know who's gonna survive? The South, because now all the industry is moving south. [horns honking] - [Ross] It's beautiful. - Brand new. - [Ross] It's a 38? That's great. - [Ross] My sister has invited me to a costume party and has suggested that I bring Claudia as my date. [television commercial playing] - What'd you do all day? - [Ross] I filmed. - I know but, what? - [Ross] I filmed Dede, Dede and Steve. - [Ross] Before my date I have dinner with my father and stepmother. [television blaring] [channels changing][television turns off] I filmed them, Dede washing her dog. And I filmed Steve going to the music company where he used to work. - How is that gonna be used for? - In this film? It'll just have to-- - [Father] In any film. [stepmother chuckling] - [Claudia] Are you ready to go? You are? Okay, let's go. - [Girl] Wait, let me get some apple juice. - [Ross] Speaking of apple juice, do we have any bourbon? - Let me see, check the house. - [Voiceover] We're gonna bring the judges back here from their deliberations to announce the winners of the costume contest. - [Female] Whoo! [dance music playing] - Test, one, two. I had a great time at the costume ball with Claudia. I have to be quiet though because my father's asleep upstairs and I think he already has enough questions about the validity of my film project without seeing me dressed up like this, talking to my own camera. So I have to be quiet. Tonight I have to decide also, whether I'm going to stay here in Charlotte or, or continue to film, retrace Sherman's route through the South as I'd originally planned to do. I mean I could stay here in Charlotte and spend some time filming my sister, and film Claudia, get to know Claudia better. She could teach me to roller skate. I mean I like Claudia, and I'm infatuated with Pat Rendleman. And I guess in many ways I'm still in love with Anne, the woman up in New York. It's all very confusing to me, I don't know what to do right now. Actually, I think I should really continue to retrace Sherman's route through the South. I think that's a good idea. I mean I'm really intrigued by William Tecumseh Sherman. I think he's one of history's tragic figures. I mean you have the irony of this man who was, spent four years in Charleston, South Carolina, and called those years the best years of his life. Later spent time in New Orleans. Loved the South, loved the people of the South. And then, during the Civil War, was ordered to wage war against the South. And not just conventional warfare, as it was practiced at that time, but total warfare against a civilian population. He fought it very well. And was thought generally to be ruthless, and cruel, and, totally unkind, but what people don't realize was that Sherman was actually very insecure. He was plagued by anxiety, by insomnia. He wrote to his brother about how he thought he contemplated suicide. But somehow despite all of these, these fallabilities, Sherman waged war brilliantly against the South, brought the South to it's knees. So then what did he do? He offered the South exceedingly generous terms of surrender. Frankly much more generous than the South deserved. And what did this get him? William Stanton, the Secretary of State at that time, publicly rebuked Sherman and rescinded the terms of his surrender, the terms of surrender that he'd granted to the South. Humiliated Sherman. The papers of the North, the politicians in the North, branded Sherman incompetent and a traitor. So here you have this man who was reviled in the South, hated in the South, he still is today, I can't talk about him around here, and yet, also rebuked in the North despite his victory. Sherman retired from the Army, and vowed never to set foot in Washington D.C. again and went back to his native Ohio. He's a very, very tragic figure, William Tecumseh Sherman. - [Ross] I decide to resume filming along Sherman's route and I drop by to say goodbye to Claudia but she's not home. The car runs beautifully, that is until I get about 40 miles outside of Atlanta, where the headlights suddenly go out, followed by the fuel pump, the ignition and the battery. [Voiceover] Now if you have a pair of pliers, I'd put one right here and I'd put one right there and I'll hold it in my hand, I'll tell you what, I bet you that son of a gun will be light up like a lightning boom standing. But ain't no power in it. - [Ross] But it's brand new-- - It's slam dead. - [Ross] crank right up. - That's what I'm saying. - 'Cause you have a damn good battery, good set of cables to put the fire into it, it'll crank it. - [Ross] I was stranded in Adrian, Georgia. There was one service station in town but it was closed and there were no motels or boarding houses. - This is your room here for the night. We have two beds, you're gonna be sleeping on this one, or either one you'd like to sleep on. - [Ross] All right. - You have your bathroom set there, you got the sink, you know, put you a book down there to read. - [Ross] They've left the Bible for me on my bed. [police station intercom] - [Voiceover] [mumbles] all cars, be on the lookout for four escapees from the Women's Correctional Institute in Milledgeville. Four escapees, Women's Correctional Institute, in Milledgeville, subjects, all four subjects are black females, 17 to 20 years of age, all were last seen wearing blue jean shorts, white tee shirts and tennis shoes. - [Ross] I finally fall asleep around three in the morning and dream not of nuclear war, but that I'd been captured and held hostage by four female escapees in white tee shirts and cutoff jeans. - Let me look at this thing. - [Ross] All right. - [Mechanic] Hey Brent, how you doing? [mumbling] One of them, yeah. [mumbling] - [Brent] What's that leaking out? Water? - [Ross] That's just water from that radiator hose. If you start looking you can find a lot of things That need to be worked on. - [Mechanic] Right. [laughing] - [Ross] Don't look too hard. [engine starting] - [Ross] All right. [engine drowns out speech] [laughing] - [Ross] Off the coast of Savannah, Georgia there's an island names Ossabaw and in 1864, federal gunboats anchored off Ossabaw Sound and successfully blockaded Savannah, enabling Sherman to capture the town. The island isn't open to the public, but I've applied for permission to do more of my historical research. [grunting] [splashing] - Bess come here, come on. Come on, it's bath time. Come on, no you gotta sit in. No Bess, Bess, sit. Sit. Sit in the water, come on. Sit, sit Bess. This is what you've been practicing for all these years. No, come on now I wanna give you a bath. Michael, I would like something to pour water over her with. This is especially vulnerable spot for fleas, yes. - [Ross] There are only a handful of full-time residents on the island, among them Michael, a geologist, and Wini, a linguist, who is working on her Ph.D. - [Wini] How you doing? You know, tonight when you can get one sound night's sleep without itching, and biting and scratching. - [Ross] After a while I learned that contrary to what I had assumed, Wini and Michael do not live together. In fact, Michael lives in a little cabin at one end of the estuary, and Wini lives at the other end. I happen to have a extra half-roll of film and I decide to ask Wini if she'd be willing to discuss her work in linguistics with me. - I can't explain serious linguistics in two and a half minutes. [laughing] That's ridiculous. I'm not even gonna try. But in the other case, where the existential quantifier has scope over Sue's wanting, there is an act such that, x's are sweet and Sue wants to marry x. Then it sorta has scope over everything and so it's making an assertion about a fact of the world that there is an existence, this we. - [Ross] How does this relate to-- - [Both] Referential opacity? Well, this guy David Lewis has something called counterpart theory, where you talk about your counterpart in possible worlds. And so you define a possible world in terms of being a set of counterparts, relevant counterparts, to individuals in this world. Which makes it even more interesting, it's really sort of exotic and exciting to think about yourself as having a counterpart in all of these imaginary worlds. [engine cranking] [engine cranking] [engine staring] You know one way of accounting for the difference between referential and attributive uses of a known phrase is to make use of the difference between intention and extension and say that there is some sense of the referring expression that is important. In the sentence, Smith's murderer is insane, that there is a sense associated with the expression Smith's murder, murderer, and that's the intention. That's what we call intention. - [Ross] You're the Julia Child of linguistics. [laughing] - I don't know what a linguist hopes to accomplish in Ossabaw. Time to be alone and think. [milk splashing] Time to get away from, theoretical feuds. - [Ross] And other kinds of feuds too right? - Well yeah. - [Ross] So how is it you always got involved with your instructors and your professors? - Ross, I can't believe you just asked me that question. When you're studying the same thing and you're both really interested in the same thing you think about it a lot. And you're really fascinated with someone who can talk well and think well about the things you find most interesting in life. [milk splashing] I have told you that for a very long time I believed that the only important things in life were linguistics and sex. It was easy to see how one would get involved with a linguistics professor. - [Ross] Do you still believe that? - Well, I think there are other important things. I'm very fond of this cow. - [Ross] My interest in linguistics continues to grow. There are other unused cabins at the camp and I ask if I might move into one of them for a while. [engine revving] [engine drowns out Wini's speech] - [Ross] You're spinning very slowly, but you're not gaining any ground. [engine revving] - [Wini] There's no solid place. - [Ross] There's no solid place? - Uh-uh, I don't think so. - [Ross] Wini, how far back down this road is it? - [Wini] Four miles maybe. [laughing] - [Ross] I don't think I have enough film to cover that entire walk. [laughing] Well I'm really glad you had this idea to go to the beach. [laughing] It was a great idea. - [Wini] What I really wanted was a walk in the woods and this was just my way of getting out. - [Ross] Oh I see, well I could think of much easier ways to do it. You know this hippie lifestyle, just has-- - It's not a hippie lifestyle though. - [Ross] It is a hippie lifestyle. - No it's not. - [Ross] In New York and Boston you can get on the subway and ride to the beach. And here you have to drive through five miles of miserable, swampy, muddy road, be attacked by mosquitoes, and you get stuck in the mud for all your trouble. And then you have to walk back. - And you never get to the beach. - [Ross] You never get to the beach. [Wini mumbling] [thunder rumbling] - [Ross] Sounds like it's gonna rain. - [Wini] I know. It is, it's already raining somewhere. God, look at that. That's really pretty. [thunder rumbling] - [Wini] Excuse me. Ticks are just one of the horrible things that you find on your body around here. - [Ross] What else am I in store for? - [Wini] Well, I'm not sure what all these things are. I think they're chigger bites, or as Wes Stanfield says, redbug bites. [laughing] - [Ross] Can you show me a tick? - [Wini] Show you a tick? Are you kidding? These things are microscopic. Every little creepy feeling you're looking to see if it's a tick. But then you develop a really good sense for knowing exactly where they are, or you feel. Would you like me to see if you have any? - [Ross] Sure. - Okay, I think I got most of mine. Excuse me, I have to do my underarm. [chuckling] [mumbles] But they're pretty hard to find. - [Wini] I hate to disappoint you but I don't see anything like a tick here, except that with your freckles it's hard to tell. Ticks look like freckles. [laughing] Are you ticklish on your knee? - [Ross] What are you writing? - A letter to Lee. - [Ross] I've been doing some research on Sherman's march. Do you wanna hear it? - Sure. - [Ross] Inside the fort lay the dead as they had fallen and they could hardly be distinguished from their living comrades sleeping soundly side-by-side in the pale moonlight. Isn't that beautiful? Sherman wrote that. He was actually pretty eloquent. - [Wini] Was the march to the sea an attempt to show people that he wasn't a failure? - [Ross] I think probably so. Until the war between the States came along Sherman was a failure in all modes of public life. He tried to start, I think, a lumber business, a real estate business, an insurance business, and all of them failed, he was a terrible businessman. Don't you see the resemblance between me and Sherman? - [Wini] Physical resemblance you mean? - [Ross] In that he had a red beard and I have a red beard. - [Wini] Yeah well that's true. [laughing] That's a big similarity. - [Ross] And another way in which there were many failures. All of my love relationships have been disasters, which could be said to be the equivalent of you know, trying to start a lumber business or a real estate business that failed terribly. I mean, that's also - [Wini] [snorting] Ross, there's no analogy between a real estate business and a love affair. [waves crashing] - [Ross] Life becomes an endless succession of pleasant chores and trips to the beach. I'm convinced that I've stumbled into Eden. Wini and I are very happy together and we live like Rousseau's savages. Except occasionally we still talk about referential opacity and counterpart theory. Unfortunately I was broke and I had to return to Boston to take a film editing job. I promised to return after two months but it ended up being longer, and Wini and I continued to write. Then one day she called to tell me that if I did come back, things would have to be a little different. - [Wini] You're almost like a blind person groping your way. - [Ross] That's the way I feel. - [mumbles] Don't trip now. Should I go? - [Ross] Yeah, go ahead. - [Wini] I like this one. If you don't mind sleeping with roaches. The conenoses come up through the cracks in the wood. I don't know if you'd like them. I don't know, I only see them when they're kind of dirt surfaces, the surfaces. - [Ross] When they're full of you're own blood? - [Wini] Yeah and they slow down a bit, then you get to see them, they kind of, after they've gotten full, they hang around in your sheets for a while till they can move again. - [Ross] The whole notion about blood-sucking conenoses just terrifies me. - Well I know it's, if they had given them a different name it wouldn't be so bad but. - [Ross] So Wini, what's happening with you and Michael? - [laughs] Did you wait to ask me that? - [Ross] Well, now that you bring the subject up. - [laughs] I don't know Ross. I find I tend to want to push a relationship to a conclusion, for some reason. As you know, you know, with you I was always dissatisfied with what was happening, and I wanted something more or different to happen. And I wanted to do that, more, but. - [Ross] But you're definitely living together. - Yeah, we're living together. And we'll be together a lot this fall. We'll see each other a lot. I just can't imagine my life without Michael. Right now. - This is where I sleep now, or where I try to sleep. [deep squealing] It's a wild pig. A wild pig probably being strangled, by an alligator or a snake or something. Anyway, I sleep here alone and Wini stays with Michael. I'm not quite alone actually there are an awful lot of insects here. Mosquitoes, are just maddening. There are chiggers, there are ticks, the worst, the thing that I fear the most is the blood-sucking conenose, which Wini's told me about, which apparently inhabit this treehouse and all the other places around here. It's impossible to sleep, it's six o'clock in the morning and I haven't slept at all. - [Ross] I had visions of those blood-sucking conenoses. - Yeah. - [Ross] I was sure they were all over my body. - [chuckling] Could you feel them creeping up and down? - [Ross] Yeah but, so I woke up countless times checking for them, and I took the flashlight and looked all around the bed and all I could find was ants. Just hundreds of ants. - Oh there were? - [Ross] Oh yeah. - You seem to be plagued by the ants. - [Ross] Why did you leave me for Michael? - Michael was here, Ross, and you were gone filming. - Gone filming? - [Wini] Yes. - Gone to earn a living. - Gone to earn a living, that's true, Michael doesn't earn a living. He probably has more money than you though. - [Ross] Well he lives on this island paradise, you both do, you don't understand what the real world is like out there. - No, we don't. I wonder if we ever will understand again what the real world is like. - [Ross] I don't know. - Well I'll tell you one of the things about Michael is that he generally has time and patience, you know? And sometimes I need time and patience, a lot. - [Ross] I was pretty patient with you Wini. - You were, sort of but you would get impatient. And you were off and you were just gone. [metal clanking] - [Ross] I didn't handle things very well with Wini. By leaving her for so long I sabotaged our relationship. If I'd really wanted things to work out I would have found some way to come back sooner. Now I feel jealousy but also friendship, towards both Wini and Michael. It's all very complicated and awkward with just the three of us living here. [metal screeching] I want to leave but I can't until the ferry boat comes so for the next few days I continue to help with the chores but somehow it isn't the same. - [Michael] They don't seem really upset right now. They will be later I think. They can only take so much of this, you know, 10 minutes, 20 minutes. They might be like this all the time, right now they're exceptionally docile. - [Ross] Shit! Ow, ow! Goddamn. [rolling thunder] My nights are plagued and tormented by a wide variety of insects. What little sleep I get is troubled by dreams of thermonuclear war. It seems to rain every day. Finally, I return to the mainland. - [Voiceover] Up, down, back, down, up and down, two, three. - [Ross] I get a motel room but still I can't sleep so I watch TV. [television knob clicking] [growling] God, how awful. In an attempt to cheer myself up I go to a local bar that has live music. [slow country music] - [Ross] The next morning I find a monument under construction in nearby Sumter, South Carolina, a town leveled by Sherman in 1865. - [Woman] We've been a chapter since 1896 and we inherited this property from the Ladies Monumental Association that was established in 1869. - I read not long ago calling my attention to the fact, that many of those young boys, some of them went in at 14 and 15, they'd never had a sweetheart. But yet they went into the battlefield and were killed. - [Ross] That's very sad. - Well, I imagine, well, there's nothing glamorous about war, no matter how you want to make it. There's nothing, death and destruction. - [Ross] Finally I call a friend of mine, a former girlfriend I haven't seen in a long time. We saw each other off and on for about a year, but then stopped seeing each other. And now she's planning to move to California, and I feel there's still some things we need to talk about before she leaves. - My solution is simple. I'm just a simple man, I make a living simply farming. The only solution is for us and Russia to stop the manufacture of these bombs, right now. [cheering and applause] [wind rumbling] [rain pattering] - [Ross] When I arrived, Jackie was involved in a protest. Her last one, against a nearby military plant that processes plutonium for nuclear weapons. - A show of hands is a visual petition. Each handprint is a vote no to the image that's painted on the canvas. And we've had participation now from artists all across the country and even a few in Europe and we hope that this show of hands will continue to grow, so with your help today we can make a beautiful canvas, so please go back between the trees there and take a look at the canvases and give us your hand. Thank you. [applause] - [Announcer] Coming up we have the-- - [Jackie] Now, anywhere you like, we're making a flag there so-- [announcer drowns out speech] [guitar and vocal music] - [Ross] The protesters are also angry about the fact that most of the nation's nuclear waste happens to be dumped in South Carolina, primarily by northerners. For over ten years now Jackie has spent nearly all of her free time trying to get the government to change this policy. But very little has changed. [people chattering] [bluesy guitar singer] - When I'm somewhere else, the same issues exist, but it's not my town, my state, my responsibility, and I have more choice. I don't feel needed, necessary. I would like to be gone and let it happen with other people. - [Ross] Would it happen without you? - [Gir] Without you, it won't happen. - Well there's, well, I can't stay and do it. I'm too burned out, I've been doing it too long. I've just, I'm, and Sherwood Smith says he's gonna operate that plant till the year 2007. - [Jackie] And if you don't have a super thin hairline it doesn't look like calligraphy. Now, you're right-handed, right? Okay, hold the pen, let me see how you hold the pen. - [Ross] Jackie teaches art in a public school in Hartsville, South Carolina, the town she grew up in. - [Jackie] Okay, now you wanna keep that angle the whole time. All right, now we're starting at the top. - [Jackie] Well this is the entrance, to the-- - So we're just getting there. - [Jackie] This is the pavilion, the visitor's pavilion right here. This will tell you, this is bronze, and it's tell you who did it, and it'll tell you the best dates. [students chatting] See this tells you - [Girl] That is some serious something about it. - [Girl] hunk of man. This is something about World War II. This is a World War II monument. - Boy he got big feet. - Those are good feet though. - I bet if he was to kick a football it's be a goal. [laughing] - [Girl] Look at that body. - His feet look so real. - [Girl] But look at that body. [laughing] - [Boy] Look at them callouses on his toes. - [Girl] Look at the body. - Yeah, like you ain't never seen a body before. I got a body, you got a body. [girls chatting] - [Seated Girl] Oh take my picture mister. [shouting] - All right. - All right, mother goes to sleep early right? - [Ross] She goes to bed early. - What time? - [Ross] Oh about ten o'clock I guess. - What time you and her go to bed? - [Ross] [chuckles] Jackie and me? - Uh huh. - [Ross] Well we go to bed at different times. About, you know, 11, 12. - Well the only thing you got to do is just get serious. - [Ross] Get serious? - Yeah. - [Ross] What do you mean by get serious? - You know what I'm talking about. Throw down. - [Ross] You shouldn't talk about your teacher like that. - Oh she don't mind. [laughing] - [Ross] A few years ago, things ended somewhat unhappily for Jackie and me when I decided I couldn't commit myself to her. I've always felt there was something unresolved about our relationship and I've been wanting to talk to her about it but she's been reluctant. - Did you get the little tendrils, the little tiny leaves there? - [Ross] Well what do you want, really? - [Jackie] Well it was I said the other night, a political ally is more important than a lover. - [Ross] Than a love relationship? - Well, many a truth is spoken in jest. I think I was kidding when I said that. [laughing] I don't know, do you? - [Ross] I guess I don't know either. Do you want to get married? - [Jackie] Not at the moment. - [Ross] Well I wasn't asking you. [chuckling] This very moment, not in front of a green scum pond. - [Jackie] Well. - [Ross] Are you angry at me? - [Jackie] No. I think it's all more trouble than it's worth. [laughing] - [Ross] I think you've become really cynical in your-- - [Jackie] In my middle age, yeah, yeah. Haven't you? - [Female] Zanna, whoa! - [Male] Zanna. - [Ross] I didn't know until I arrived in Hartsville that Jackie had a new boyfriend. His name is Rusty, and he does legal research for a group that's challenging the safety record of the Robinson nuclear reactor. In addition to the bomb plant and the nuclear waste dumps there also happen to be a lot of nuclear reactors in this part of South Carolina. As Rusty likes to say, next to peaches plutonium seems to be the state's biggest cash crop. - It's the worst one in the country. Science Magazine calls it the one high-risk plant in America. The NRC said that it was like pouring cold water in a heated glass, that the reactor vessel itself could crack like that if the cooling water came in, it's a runaway rhinoceros. There ain't no way to stop it. - And it is brittle, it is the most brittle reactor vessel in the entire United States. We're sitting here, five miles way from Old Rob. I'm trying to get outta here and go to California. Here you know, I'm compelled to say something, as a, you know, being of this place out there, you know, real shallow roots. Out there everybody lives in a yogurt cup, you know? And I'll just get a nice yogurt cup and just hang out. - [Ross] Do you think you'll come back? - Oh yeah, I'll always come back. Till the vessel cracks at Old Rob. And when the vessel cracks, those of us who ain't here won't be coming back. - Quit smooching. You and Ms. Carrie y'all was smooching. You and Ms. Carrie quit smooching or I'm gonna tell. - [Jackie] But, I wasn't-- - Yeah see I'm gonna make sure y'all don't get no job next year. See I'll put in a recommendation that y'all do not get no job for smooching on campus. - [Ross] She's quitting. - She quitting? - [Jackie] Yeah. - What you quitting for? - So I can smooch. - Oh, she put Chapstick on her lips too y'all done check it out she's smooching now. Woohoo, y'all better quit that. You see this nice [mumbles] trophy? - [Ross] Did you win that for smooching? - Nu-uh, I lost. Hey Ms. Carrie, here he is, you better smooch with him. [laughing] - I don't want any witnesses for this. - [Student] Yeah he got it on Daddy. He better have it on. - Go on to the back of that something over there. - Y'all gonna start smooching, you and her? - Okay, that should be about right, try. Film yourself getting into the hammock. - [Ross] Why not? - Why not. [laughs] [Ross grunting] It's okay, it's on right. - [Ross] It's the day before Jackie leaves, and she's read in the newspaper about a recently constructed monument, one she wants to see before leaving the South. - [Ross] How's your Arabic? - [Jackie] It doesn't take as much space. - [Ross] The monument was erected anonymously for survivors of nuclear war. It explains in 12 different languages how to reconstruct civilization. [tapping] - [Ross] Best method I've ever seen. - She hears that sound, you coming over here Zanna? You make it cool Zanna, get a cool place, yeah. [laughing] [plane engine roaring] - [Ross] We arrive at the airport just a few minutes before Jackie's flight departs. It seems we never really did find time to talk and now there's barely time to say goodbye. [wipers rubbing and squeaking] A sort of creeping, psychosexual despair begins to overtake me, but suddenly I hear on the radio that Burt Reynolds himself is in town, shooting his next picture. I decide to see if I can find him and film him. After doing some research I locate the production crew's motel and as I drive up I spot Burt Reynolds himself, standing all alone. I cannot believe it. He tries to slip away but I follow him. Much to my surprise when I ask him if I can film him he says yes, he'd be delighted to be filmed. He's very cooperative. The only trouble is, he's not Burt Reynolds. His name is Randy, and for two days he's been trying to get work as a stand in for Mr. Reynolds. - [Ross] Do you have many women come up and ask you for autographs and pester you and things like that? - Yeah. My whole life, I won't lie. A whole lot of women come up and ask me if I'm Burt Reynolds or if I'm his stunt man or his double or something like that. I always have to tell them no so maybe now, in the next 15 minutes, I will be his double, or his stunt man. - [Ross] Well, what time is now, quarter till? Quarter till one? - [Randy] Quarter to one. And we're still standing here. What's it, eight hours and 45 minutes I've been at this hotel waiting for him. - [Ross] We wait until three in the morning, but the real Burt Reynolds never shows up. - [Voiceover] Call it the war between the States, or the Civil War, it was a bitter and bloody test of national unity. And it was the North's industrial might, harbinger of the nation's future, which helped break the valiant lines of grey. It was a time of many changes. And it was the testing grounds for a breed of new and deadly weapons, that would forever end the glorious toy soldier wars, of tall stone forts and long lines of brightly uniformed men advancing into battle to the sound of music, and the roll of drums. - [Woman] I am bored with your singleness. It is a bore for you to get to be middle-aged and be lonely. It is, it's very boring for you to be lonely. - [Ross] Well I've made attempts at correcting that situation. - Yeah well see that failed, that's the other thing that's boring is failure. It is time to get on it. You have been in insufficient to this quest and so I have to take over. I have to. Because otherwise, I'm gonna be so bored, with your loneliness that I'm gonna have to dump you myself. I mean we're just gonna have to, we've got to get on it. Really now. You're too old to be, one, alone and two, failing in your attempts to couple. So I'm coupling you. - [Ross] Why do you think Dee Dee Geraty's the perfect person, for me? - I think she's the perfect person for you because I think she's a woman that can appreciate you. Now the only way to get you coupled and it to be a permanent thing is to find you a woman who thinks that you're God. It's gonna take a very special kind of woman to think that you're a God, too. - [Ross] While in Charleston I'm visiting my friend and former teacher, Charleen. For several months now Charleen's been trying to get me to meet a friend of hers, who's a singer and a musician. - [Charleen] Listen, you can listen to this twice, why don't you? For this first listening to Dee Dee, forget the fucking film and listen to Dee Dee. This is your wife. This is your betrothed. - [Ross] Play the tape. [slow, graceful, folk music] - Listen to this, listen. Listen to this oh. [woman on tape singing] That's really what I always wanted to do. If you did that you wouldn't need to eat, you wouldn't need sex, you wouldn't need anything if you got a mouth like Dee Dee Geraty has. - [Female] Oh I'm so glad to see you. - And keep up a courage because, now look right at him, yeah, look right at him for the first time. - [Ross] Hello Dee Dee. - Hi, I'm glad to meet you. - [Ross] I'm glad to meet you too. Charleen has, to say the least, said a lot about you. - Oh and about you. [laughing] - Would you stop, would you stop? - [Ross] Don't touch that lens! - I can't help but touch it, turn it off. This is important, this is not art, this is life. - [Ross] All right. - [Charleen] Now of all times, would you stop it, this is life. - [Dee Dee] Oh I'm really impressed, oh my. - [Charleen] Oh you've never been in here Dee Dee? - [Dee Dee] No this is the first on all counts. - Okay, well next week you'll get the view of the park. Burt just sit down right here. Burt looked lost because he's following us. Ross would you stop it? - [Ross] I have to film this. - [Charleen] Dee Dee look, he's just determined. Give me your umbrella and-- - [Dee Dee] And your note. - The umbrella and the note, and I will hit Ross with it-- - Well hit him with the note. - I will castrate him. Ross I'm going to do it right to the parts, to the south parts of your body! He's gonna go limp. - [laughing] All right. [laughing] Oh my. - [Charleen] He did turn it off didn't he? - No it's still running I think. - [Ross] Charleen you're being very forward we've only known each other for about, how long has it been? - [Dee Dee] Eight minutes. - [Ross] Eight minutes. - [Charleen] Eight minutes. Well you all don't have much time. Time is moving on. - [Ross] Hey we're still pretty young. - Well it just depends on how you look at it. You all are getting a late start. Both of you should have been pregnant eight years ago. [laughing] It's true. - [Ross] Well, better late than never. - [Charleen] He's not filming he's just turning from one person to another, I can tell when the camera-- - [Ross] You can hear it if it's running. - That's right so you aren't filming. - [Ross] No not right now. - So you're using this camera because you don't want to be with us. - [Ross] Maybe it's just that I'm camera shy in a reverse way, and I'm hiding behind the camera. - Well I think maybe you are Ross, the minute we start talking about progeny you pick that thing up and you're just using it as a hedge. [Ross laughing] I mean as something to hide behind. You are not filming. - [Ross] No I'm not, I'm filming. - [Charleen] Put it down. We're talking about your children. - [Ross] Well, this film deals with those kinds of things. [laughing] It does. - With what kinds of things, with your children? - [Ross] Well I don't have any children yet. - I know but we're getting right on it if you put that camera down we'll get there faster. We'll get there a lot faster. [laughing] - [Ross] The next day Charleen shows me her neighborhood. She lives with her husband on what was once a military base. What is this? - [Charleen] This some war trash honey. I'm trying to remember what you said that irked me so because it is so absolutely, totally the wrong thing to say to a woman. - [Ross] What did I say? - When you said to Dee Dee, over the telephone, before you ever met her, don't bother to take your vacation now, wait, I mean, don't wait, don't do anything for me, this is absolutely the wrong thing to say Ross. I mean what you say to a woman, is not self-effacing. I mean that's not even interesting, let alone-- - [Ross] I'd never met her before, I didn't want her to-- - I don't care Ross, I'm trying to tell you-- - [Ross] To postpone her vacation because I was coming into town, that's absurd. - Ross that's what's wrong with you. What she wants to hear, what all women wanna hear, what children wanna hear, you've got to be more passionate Ross. Now if you had said to Dee Dee, please postpone your vacation, the only thing that matters to me is seeing you and being with you. - [Ross] I'd never met her! - Postpone your va, I don't care Ross, I'm telling you! You're not as interesting because you're so self-effacing and polite. Now it's all right to have lovely manners, you must have them. Dee Dee wants you to have them, I want you to have them, but I also am telling you that that doesn't mean that you can't be passionate. Passion is the only thing, the important thing, you must say, you're the only woman I've ever seen, I would die for you, I live for you, I breathe for you. Please, for God sakes, take your vacation and be with me, because this is the most important point in my life. Now you've got to learn to talk like that. You've got to learn to feel like that. How can you be a filmaker if you never have any passion? - [Ross] I have plenty of passion, I don't even know her. I don't know anything about her. - This doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that you don't know her. What matters is the quality of your passion. So what that you don't know her? That's not relevant. - [Ross] Can we walk through here? - [Charleen] Yes we can walk through here. - [Ross] Where does it come out? - [Charleen] We don't know where it comes out. We're just passionately gonna walk through it. We don't even care where it comes out. - [Ross] This place is like a tomb. - [Charleen] Now you, no it's not it's like pubic hair, part the bushes, go into the place. Go with it Ross, it's not like a tomb. That's the problem with you, you don't know the difference between sex and death. - [Ross] Sex and death? - Sex and death, this is life. - [Ross] One and the same. - Dang you can't even tell it, when it sits on your face you can't tell which it is. This is the way women wanna hear men talk to them, now see Becky knows how to talk. I love you and I can't help it and I don't care who knows it. What is she saying? I give you my life and heart. This is the way I want you to talk to Dee Dee, this is the language women can understand. That's what they believe, they experience it in their own lives. - [Ross] Well not all women. - Well the only women that I know believe that. That's the only way that I could understand your belief. - [Ross] I've felt that way about a couple of people. It doesn't solve everything, it's the point. - Well you never solve everything Ross, you never solve everything. The only thing you've got is a chance at a few passionate hits. You see how foolish it all is. You see what the army comes to. The bunkers, the island, the burned out house, hell it's all a tragedy. It's just a matter of how you get through it. And the most interesting way to get through it is to say I can't help it, I'm full of passion and I'm gonna die this moment. It's the only way to pretend you're alive. It's the only way to, not be alone and depressed. You've got to kid yourself, you've got to kid her, and then you both believe it. - [Ross] The next day Charleen takes me to visit Dee Dee at a girls' school where Dee Dee had once been a student and where she now works as an administrator. ♪ Sing sing a happy heart ♪ Raise happy voices one and all ♪ We are happy to say that we're [children singing] ♪ And we live by the golden rule ♪ We will always be friends ♪ Till the very, very end [children singing] [singing "Just The Way You Are"] ♪ Just the way you are ♪ Don't go trying some new fashion ♪ Don't change the color of your hair ♪ You always have my unspoken passion ♪ I love you just the way you are ♪ - [Ross] Ashley Hall School For Girls. It dawns on me that I have somehow wandered into the very cradle of Southern womanhood. [knocking] - [Young Lady] Hi. - [Ross] Hello. - How are you? - [Ross] Do you mind if I take a few pictures in here? [young ladies mumbling] [classroom chatter] - [Girl One] I like that one, what about you? - [Girl Two] You pick it. [excited chatter] - [Girl] Your hair looks so pretty. - [Girl] Crows feet on the eyes, they can airbrush those out. They can take out those zits on your face, they can airbrush those out. If you have real prominent birthmarks, they'll take those out, they can slim your nose down, or widen it, take bags out from underneath your eyes. - Now I'm giving you a few more hours, the two of you, even some time alone to get used to the idea, because the wedding is happening. I want you married, by Christmas. That's this year. - [Dee Dee] That sounds close. - [Charleen] Because time is wasting. It's to be a Christmas wedding, Ross, do you understand me? Ross, you're getting married this December. See before I ever met you I was longing for Ross to meet a woman who was not sullen. And who, what else what it Ross? I had it very, I had it down pat. I wanted her to not be sullen and I wanted her to be-- - [Ross] Rich. - No I did not, rich, rich does not matter. You're the one with that responsibility, you have to make some money. You have to put that camera down and make some money. I'm considering putting you into dentistry anyway, this won't do, this won't do. This is a beautiful child and she must be supported while she raises your children. - [Ross] I go home with Dee Dee to meet her mother. - When she speaks of supplies, she means everything. - [Dee Dee] Right, first aid. - For survival, first aid. Really, survival things. - [Dee Dee] Yeah, everything. - [Mother] Everything but it's a terribly expensive-- - As well as food. - [Ross] Proposition? - [Mother] Proposition, and the place to store all this material within the house itself is almost impossible. - [Ross] Wait, okay. - Have to come around. - [Ross] I better come around on the other side. - [Dee Dee] All right, reach in for the light. Here are the three boxes, 25 pounds of low-fat imitation dry milk. - [Ross] Where's the water kept? - [Mother] In the garage. - The water's in the garage. Wanna go out that way? - [Ross] Sure. - [Mother] That's safe, water's safe at any temperature. Isn't that right? - [Dee Dee] Unless we're growing algae. And it's to the right. - [Ross] You're giving away all your secrets. I'm gonna know where everything is now. [laughing] - [Dee Dee] So this is two six-gallons of water. - [Ross] Oh, underneath. - [Dee Dee] Two six-gallon containers. We have another gallon container, and a five-gallon container in the laundry room. - [Ross] And then you have a warehouse which has, a little bit of food and-- - [Dee Dee] Six weeks worth, of dehydrated food. - You can tell the different in the old wall and the new wall, they keep patching it up. I don't wanna go in here Ross, because it bores me to death. I'll show you some of the secret bunkers that are a lot more romantic than this. This is what, sort of been done again for show and the, I don't know, the only reason I'd come down here is to get out of a hurricane, let's go. - [Ross] Charleen, you know General Sherman was here though? This is where he stayed for four years. - Wait, he stayed at Moultrie? - [Ross] Yeah. - He didn't stay in this fort did he? - [Ross] Yes he did. - Sherman did? - [Ross] Yep, from 1842 to 1846. - Well now I know we ought to get out of here, come on. - [Ross] No, he liked it here a lot. He liked the South, he had friends in Charleston, and he was a painter, he painted portraits of his friends in Charleston. - He painted portraits? - [Ross] Yeah, and he did still life watercolors of the landscape. He really did like the South, that was why I'm so fascinated by him, you know. - Well Ross it's certainly, I don't think you'd find many people who live down here who agree with you that he liked the South. I mean he did a whole lot of things. I mean you know. - [Ross] I know. - I mean the Late Great Unpleasantness was really a great unpleasantness. He destroyed everything. - [Ross] Yeah. One reason why they, hi. - Hi, how are you folks today? - [Ross] Just fine, thank you. - I'd appreciate it if, can I help you with something, are you? - [Charleen] No, can we help you with something? - [Ross] Just sorta filming. - Is this your vehicle right here? - [Charleen] Yes and we're getting ready to move that vehicle right this minute. - Okay, thank you because the police will tow you out of there very quickly. - Yeah, well we're not going any place except away. I like your hat. - Thank you. But that's a yellow zone right there and they are very, very picky about parking regulations on this island. - [Charleen] Now the Civil War started right here with shelling, all into Fort Sumter from Fort Johnson and Fort Moultrie. Now we're sitting right here, right at the front gun of Fort Moultrie. Here comes another one, let's watch this. - [Ross] All right. - [Charleen] Coming around the bend. - [Ross] She's giving me a very strong look. - [Charleen] She looks gorgeous though. She don't care, she's so strong and beautiful. [laughing] - Thanks. - [Woman] What, thanks for what? - We're just looking at everything that's beautiful and you became part of it. - Oh wow, thank you very much. It is beautiful over there. - [Charleen] Yes, it really is. - [Ross] Bye bye. - Ross do you like her? Mother'll try to buy her for ya. [public chatter] - [Boy] Hey there's your boat. - [Ross] How is it you don't drink coffee, or coke, or beer, or anything? How do you live in the 20th century? [laughing] - It's hard to live in Charleston, let me tell you. [laughing] Not it really, I-- - [Ross] Is it health reasons, the caffeine? - It's, well, I'm a Mormon, member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. - [Ross] Is that part of, I didn't realize that. - Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet whose mission it was to restore Christ's church in it's fullness. And these, the Latter Days, it's the days prior to the second coming. And there are-- - [Ross] I didn't realize that's what Latter Day meant. - That's what that means. America is the promised land. And this nation is [mumbles] this land and that we believe very vigorously that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, were divinely inspired documents. It's no accident that the United States of America is the kind of nation that it is. - [Ross] Well do you think that the possibility of the third world war is figured into the Revelations? - Yes, yes 'cause we've been told that there will be great destruction, prior to the second coming. That, and this of course is part of why we think we should be prepared with our storage of all different kinds. Because there will be wars and rumors of war. The pregnant lady, a mother who's expecting a child doesn't know the hour of it's birth, but she knows when she's in her ninth month that it's not going to be next year. We're in that sort of latter days now. We have, the signs of the times are all around us. - [Ross] This is Fort Moultrie, and it's about a mile from Charleen's house. I have to be careful because the rangers have told me that I'm not allowed to film here without permission and I could get into trouble so I'm trying to do this sort of, low profile. Also, there are Boy Scouts all over the place which makes it harder to film. But Charleen is really serious about Dee Dee and me, I mean she laughs a lot about it but, she's serious. She thinks it's ridiculous that I haven't been married yet, as old as I am, and so she offers me this woman of purity and strength and conviction. And she has the voice of a singing angel and she's from a prominent Charleston family and whose dowry apparently includes a better than average chance of survival in case of a nuclear attack. But you know, I'm just not suited for Dee Dee, I'm unsuited for her. Basically Charleen doesn't realize I have these tendencies toward depression and sort of anxiety and that I'm sort of lust-ridden and I don't know, it's just, it's not gonna work. Last night Dee Dee told me she wanted to marry a man who could bring the priesthood into her home. And that's just not me. Here come more Boy Scouts. - What's happened with Dee Dee? What happened last night? - [Ross] Did you know she was a Mormon? She is a Mormon. - Well I didn't know it at first, all I knew is that she was a singer and an extraordinary one. I knew that she was a singer, I knew she was beautiful, I knew she had charisma. - [Ross] I don't see why you thought that we had that much in common, we're actually very different people. She intends to marry someone from the Mormon church, someone who can bring the priesthood into her house. - What, you wanna tell me that again? Who can bring the priesthood into her house? - [Ross] Yep. - Ross I counted on you about that, I figured even though Dee Dee was a Mormon, that the moment she saw you in your Gatsby clothes, that religion would be just something she realized was a stall for time. - [Ross] She's very serious about her religion. She really is. - She's only serious about her religion because she's not in love. If she would fall in love with you, then it would be different. Ross, you blew it with Dee Dee. But while you were gone to Atlanta I found a girl who's better than Dee Dee. I found a wonderful girl for you, she looks like the angel on the top of the Christmas tree. She's absolutely, perfectly beautiful. She's not a Mormon, in fact, she sleeps around. I can't wait for you to meet this girl, she's gorgeous, she's darling. - [Ross] I've decided to leave Charleston before I get into more trouble with Charleen's ideas of marriage brokerage. I wander the local countryside, tracking down the remaining evidence of Sherman's presence, the shrines to the destruction he caused. Sheldon Church, torched by Sherman's ruthless scavengers in November 1864. The caskets in the church burial crypts super-heated and exploded in the fire. It seems I'm filming my life in order to have a life to film, like some primitive organism that somehow nourishes itself by devouring itself, growing as it diminishes. I ponder the possibility that Charleen is right when she says that filming's become the only way that I can relate to women. I'm beginning to lose touch with where I really am in all of this. It's a little like looking into a mirror and trying to see what you look like when you're not really looking at your own reflection. Anyway, I decide to resume following Sherman's route through South Carolina. [birds chirping] On February 16th, 1865, Sherman's troops massed here on the banks of the Congaree River in preparation for the invasion of the state capital of South Carolina, Columbia. The artillery took practice on the dome of the state Capital Building and a few days later, the troops had crossed the river and 80% of Columbia was burned to the ground.

[cheering and applause] [laughing] [chatter] [groaning] - [Ross] Her name is Joyous Perrin and she performs in bars and nightclubs around the Carolinas. From the first moment I saw her sing I became a dedicated and ardent groupie. - [Masseuse] Relax. - You guys are really cute. - [Girl] Thank you. - [Child] There's one behind you. - [Ross] I'm going to be doing some filming with Joyous I don't know if she told you about that. - No, she sure didn't, I didn't know what it was. - This is my friend Ross, and he's making a movie and I'm in his movie, and he wanted to film me doing everything I do so I brought him along. - [Child] What movie you gonna be in? - Oh. - [Joyous] Well it's a movie that Ross is making about women, ladies in the South. - Oh. - [Joyous] And I'm his singer, for the movie. - You supposed to sing? - [Joyous] Yeah. He's been following me around, filming me singing all over the place. - [Girl] Ooh I see. [jazz piano playing] - See that gives, that adds something okay and then, and then when I finish my solo, go back and sing one more verse, and go back to that and that'll be the song. - [Girl] Daddy. - [Man] What? - [Girl] I want grape. - [Man] You want grape jelly? - [Girl] Yeah. [singing "Nobody Knows You" by Otis Redding] [children shouting] - It's those hotels. I really don't have any need to be nervous. Well maybe it's just 'cause it's Grady's and my actual debut. - [Ross] Together you mean? - Yeah. [sighing] Hotels make me nervous, sometimes it just overcomes me, and I have no idea why and I, [sighing] just have to, get inside of myself and take a deep breath. - [Ross] Then do it. - Okay. Abracadabra. This is the beginning. - [Ross] Now what happens to it? - Now I really make it crazy. - [Ross] So what kind of an image are you trying to get here? - The sexiest, most talented, lounge singer in this case, [laughing] that this guy has ever seen. I just want to, have him melt into a little puddle at my feet. - [Ross] If I were a traveling salesman I think I'd be totally in love with you. - Wouldn't you want to see a wild woman like me in a bar, singing Mean To Me? [singing "Call It Stormy Monday" by T-Bone Walker] ♪ Wednesday is worse ♪ Thursday's oh so sad ♪ Eagle flies on Friday ♪ Saturday I go out and I play [singing "Call It Stormy Monday" by T-Bone Walker] - [Man] If you would, put your social security number next to it. - [Joyous] I've got to look that up, I'm sorry I'm on of those people that doesn't remember it, I'll have to just phone it in to you. - Okay. - [Joyous] Agency representative, what's that? - [Man] Whatever, yourself. [lively piano] - [Man] That's just fun ain't it? [laughing] - [Joyous] She thought she'd just take one you know. - Married? - [Ross] Are we married? - Yeah. - [Ross] No we're not married. - Well, do y'all stay together? - [Ross] No we don't stay together. - She stays far away don't she? - [Ross] No she lives a couple miles away from where I'm staying. - Sometimes do you go to her house? - [Ross] Oh yeah I go to her house a lot. Joy shares an apartment with her friend Catherine and they're planning to move to New York as soon as Joy finishes recording her first record album. - I think I owe myself a shot. - [Ross] If you love it so much down here why do you have to move? - Well because, the major part of the industry, I have more of a chance, of making a big success of myself, by being around the people that are in New York. I mean if I never went to New York and never gave it a try, I'd really regret that. - [Ross] Yeah? - Yeah, so I don't know I'm just gonna be there as long as I can stand it. [dog barking] - Anybody home, anybody home? Anybody home? Anybody home? [dog barking] - [Man] Jack, don't torture that dog. [dog barking] - Hey, hey, shut up dog, shut up. [dog barking] [shouting] [screaming] [dog barking] - [Man] Out, go, out, go! - Excuse me sir! [shouting] [dog barking] [hissing] - [mumbles] go on out. - Yeah if you teach a dog to protect you then you don't have to worry about it and he can be mean for you. New York tends to make people mean and I'd rather, well just be protected whenever possible. - [Ross] All set? - Bye bye. [chuckles] - [Ross] I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too. - [Ross] I know. I'll be back, someday. - I know you will. You'll always come back. - [Ross] Yeah and I think you're gonna be a success. - I hope so. - [Ross] Yeah, but, goodbye. Sad. [engine starting] - Bye bye. - [Ross] Bye bye Joy. Joy heads out on another nightclub tour. She invited me to keep traveling with her and the band but I have to return north soon and there's still one more person I want to see before I go back. - [Woman] There now that'll be, it's in water, fresh. - [Ross] I'm on my way to visit my friend Karen. Even though we knew each other all through high school she always seemed slightly out of reach, a sort of golden girl, pretty and very intelligent and very popular. After high school she went to California to go to college and I once drove out there to spend four days with her, and she once flew across country to spend a weekend with me. But somehow we never got romantically involved. After college I kept track of her enough to know that she eventually returned south and worked her way through grad school, waitressing and teaching, until she got a degree in Russian. And that she later got a law degree and finally that she'd met someone she was really serious about. Then one day she called and told me that she and her boyfriend had broken up. She was really upset and I told her to come and visit me. She ended up staying for several days and somehow things were suddenly different. I found myself falling in love with her, but she was still in love with her boyfriend and finally she felt she had to go back to him. [dog barking] Now it's been a long time since I've seen Karen and I have no idea as to whether she's still with this guy or not. [knocking] [dog whining] [door knocker clanking] - [Woman] Come in. - [Ross] Karen? - [Karen] Ross, hey! - [Ross] Hey, hey Karen. - I though maybe you hadn't, but you, Ross! - [Ross] You never know. You only get one this time. - [Karen] Hey. [laughs] - [Karen] You didn't drive far did you? - [Ross] A little bit, that's okay, not much. - You did, where have you been wandering around? - [Ross] Smile. [laughing] - I came to Irene and Dean because I just wanted, you know, just to be taken care of, and I came to see you for the same reason. It's just something, one last, like, do I really want other people to take? I want somebody to help me. - [Ross] I did want to take care of you. - But then, it was just when I realized that other people would that I realized that I could again. I mean. - [Ross] You should've told me. - I should've told you. What that I could? - [Ross] That you didn't want to be taken care of. - But I did then, I wasn't lying. I did. - [Ross] For four or five months, I didn't know what was happening. - I'm sorry. I didn't really either. I mean I think I've only found this out in the last couple weeks. I mean I haven't known all along. I've just known recently. And I, and I am sorry. I do-- - [Ross] But are you still, I don't understand, are you still going out with him? I mean, you're going to see him tonight and yet you say you're not really with him anymore. - I'm not with him at all. I'll tell you what tonight is. Tonight is this big thing that he has every year, it's huge and he invites hundred of people and I've always done it with him. I mean it's always been, you're gonna make me cry, don't. - [Ross] I don't wanna make you cry. - I'm gonna make myself cry. And I've always done it with him, and this year, you know, I knew it was gonna happen, and I knew it was gonna happen, and the other thing that I kept thinking was if Cam doesn't invite me, I'll be crushed. But he did, I mean he called and I talked to him, and it's been a long time and I said, he said, come and I said, well I don't know if I can I really, it's hard to be around you. And then I decided, a while back that yeah, I really wanna go, to see what happens. - [Ross] Once again I forget to turn on my tape recorder. Karen says, "I'm sorry to do this", and I say, "That's all right." Then Karen says, "If you want to, see what Barbara's up to. "I think she's going to a nightclub with some friends." Barbara is Karen's roommate. Then Karen says, "Will you be all right?" And I say, "Sure, I'll see you when you get back." [jazz piano playing "Putting on the Ritz"] [tap shoes clicking] - [Ross] It's amazing, I told Karen that I think that every time I appear, both Karen and I intersect, that she gets back together again with her boyfriend. - But they don't get back together again. They never last more than a day. That's hardly, I consider that hardly be getting back together again. - [Ross] Well it's lasted for more than a day, today. - Maybe this, I've always thought, each time it happened that it would be different. But it hasn't been so I'm assuming that it's never going to do it. - [Ross] Well she really loves him and she's just-- - No I think she's obsessed with him. - [Ross] Yeah, well to be obsessed, to be in love. - I, you know. - [Ross] Love is obsession. For the next few days I don't see much of Karen. She's either at work or spending time with her boyfriend. When I finally see her again it's for dinner with friends. - [Karen] 98% of the people we deal with are men, they're, like a woman defense attorney comes in, twice a week at most. We deal with men, only. And I don't have any problems with them. I don't, I mean, they might act, I'm not gonna, change anything about myself. I do the job the best I can. - Women have different personalities than men have. And I think if woman and a man are in the same job position, they should be allowed their different personalities - [Karen] That's right, and that's what's happening is that she's saying I shouldn't be allowed-- - It shouldn't be categorizes this is a woman, and woman should act like a man because she's in a man's profession. Fuck that. A woman should not act like a man because she's in a man's profession. So anyway, if it would be appropriate-- - Well it can. - You're right and so, yeah I turned it on. - [Man] Oh, super. - [Woman] And I said, yes. - [Karen] There's some rags over there. - [Woman] So I interviewed him and I said that's inappropriate. - [Karen] Move that. - [Woman] And then he decided he wanted the court date moved up and he went to Susan and he asked Susan could we move the court date up? And Susan said, well, if the investigation is done, you know, then we can. Like if we talk with the policemen and we talk with the witnesses and the victims and stuff, then we can do it. Okay, well Greg came in to the office and said, you know, Susan says we can do this. - [Voiceover] The Equal Rights Amendment has been before the North Carolina legislature for a decade, and the senators who voted on Friday did so, to quote, lay the ERA to rest for once and for all, unquote. [cheering] [clapping rythmically] [chanting] - [Ross] With consummate timing I insist upon talking with Karen about our relationship in the midst of 10,000 angry southern women. - [Woman] When do we want it? - [Crowd] Now! - [Woman] What do we want? - [Crowd] E-R-A! - [Woman] When do we want it? - [Crowd] Now! - [Ross] Are you convinced he's the only person that you could be happy with? - I know what I'm convinced is that we should be together. That we should be, I believe in what he is and what he does and what, I just, I don't know why. And it's, he, I don't know whether he, and he should believe it, that's, that's, see that's what the problem has been, is-- - [Ross] Come on through. It's okay. - Is that I, is that he believed in me when he first knew me, before I went, and, then I went through, he knew me and that's the person that he loved. And then I went there and I changed. - [Ross] To law school? - Now I'm telling him-- - [Ross] Oh but Karen it has to be more than just going to law school. - No, no and I'm telling you that now I've come back 360 degrees to where I was, and I'm not asking you to just take my word for it, but to just slowly spend a little time, and see for yourself, 'cause I know you miss me, I know you love me. - [Ross] I do. What did you feel when you were in Boston with me for five days? Was it just an escape from him? - No it was that you've always been there in the back of my soul, and it's almost that you and I are too much alike, I guess, it like you're another me. I never thought that really you and I could be lovers. - [Ross] Could be what? - Lovers. I always wished, I mean do yo know how many times I've said to Barbara that I wish Ross and I could be lovers, because it'd be so perfect. Because, it would be. - [Ross] What can I do to make myself less perfect? - No that's not it, it's just that Cam's already there, - [Woman] I think what it really boils down to, she's got a lot of money. Fantasizing's 50% of it. - I am in love with him. - [Ross] In love with him. - And I was in love with you, and I've always been in love with you but I am, I, I am. [laughing] I am. - [Ross] I have to be quiet. Karen's in the bedroom next door. And I'm here. And I can't sleep, it's, it's unbearably hot, and so I thought I would just film myself, not being able to sleep. Dreams of apocalypse. I can't get through to Karen. Now it seems she's always with her boyfriend, or talking with him on the phone, or thinking about him. She seems distant and out of reach. This isn't exactly what I'd hoped for. - Yeah. In Chapel Hill? Really? - [Ross] Bentonville, North Carolina, not far from where Karen lives. Sherman fought what was effectively the last battle of the Civil War here against a pathetic, rag-tag Confederate army of old men and boys. Even so, it was a fierce battle. One soldier's diary recounts how amputated limbs of soldiers were strewn around on this same grass outside the field hospital. And how one could tell the legs of the infantrymen from those of the cavalrymen, because the infantrymen who had been marching for months had thicker calves. I stopped filming for a few days hoping Karen and I could talk about things, but the timing's still terrible. She remains committed to her boyfriend and to working out the relationship. Bumbling around with my camera, I don't really know how to film these things and I'm ruining our friendship. - [Ross] Why aren't you in love with me? Just because he was there before? - I'm sorry, I know you're upset but that's not fair. I mean you know. - [Ross] Karen everything you've said is that we're different people. - Ross stop filming that's cruel. - [Ross] No it's not cruel. - Yes, stop. It is, stop. Cam, I mean at this time, about last August or September, I was off the edge. I, I would verbally, I mean I would say, you know, oh if only he would come back, I would, my life would be fine, everything. And now my life is fine anyway. The fact that he's come back, I think I'm just gonna sort of stand back, try to be easygoing about it and just see what happens. - [Ross] Am I gonna get a chance to meet him Karen, at some point? - Perhaps. Tomorrow, if you like. I don't know whether you like, or not. And that's entirely up to you. - [Ross] I finally meet Cam, Karen's boyfriend, when my car runs out of gas and he comes to help me out. - Fucking thing leaks like a sieve. - [Ross] Just like the car. - Huh? - [Ross] Just like the car. - Yeah. Goddammit. - [Ross] Do you have a funnel Cam? - [Cam] I did, but I lost it. I don't know, we better just pour it. - [Ross] Okay, let's do it. - [Cam] Goddammit. Sorry. You sure you've never had anybody hit you? - [Ross] Not yet. I spend the next few days with Cam and his friends. They seem to spend a lot of time collecting and trading plastic animals, like the kind you used to get in cereal boxes, except larger. - That's a canoe, I bought that. - [Voiceover] Heads up, Cammy. - [Ross] I never really understood what it was all about. - [Man] I think in the corner. - [Cam] Where, over by the dam? - [Man] Don't you think by the dam over here? - How about right up here? [groaning] - [laughing] Stop it, you stop it. - [Ross] I know it's time to leave when I find myself trying to convince Karen to fall in love with me. It's absurd, I don't even know for certain that if we had a chance we could make it together. But I find myself arguing for it as if I'm in court. Which is especially ridiculous considering that Karen's a lawyer. I decide to return to my hometown. [ratchet clicking] Unfortunately my car decides it wants to stay a while longer. The repair estimate is $600. The mechanic doesn't have the necessary parts which doesn't really matter because I don't have the necessary money. I leave my car at the garage and take a bus back to Charlotte. The Confederacy officially died here in my hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, held his last cabinet meeting not far from this marker, and fled towards Mexico, leaving behind him a ruined South. I've come to the end of my journey with no car, no money, and only one roll of film. What's worse is that I don't seem to have a real life anymore. My real life has fallen into the crack between myself and my film. I begin to feel paralyzed by these speculations when suddenly a news item on the radio snaps me out of my stupor. My old nemesis, Burt Reynolds is back in town, and I decide that this time I have to find him and film him. - [Lady] Has he already autographed 'em? - [Man] Yeah. [women exclaiming] Wait, wait, don't get on the street, we've got plenty of them. [excited clamoring] - [Ross] I had hopes of meeting Mr. Reynolds and filming him for a few days and perhaps getting his views on such topics as concepts of masculinity and romance in the South. But his staff decides that Mr. Reynolds doesn't have the time to discuss these matters with me. They do not thinks it's a good idea for me to be on the set. And they ask me to stand outside the roped off area with Mr. Reynolds' other fans. [cheering] - [Woman] Oh, hey Burt! - [Lady] Oh he's so cute, good God Almighty. [cheering and whooping] He waved right at me, did you see him? He waved right at me. [women shouting] - [Woman] Just let me get one kiss, just one. [mumbling] - [Lady] Burt, I've been here the longest time. - [Woman] Can I get one of those? - [Kerchief] Just give me a little one. [shouting excitedly] - Whoo! [excited chatter] - [Man] Over here Burt. - [Woman] Burt. [women exclaiming] [men mumbling] - [Girl] Well I wanted to shake his hand. [Man] Travis. - Yeah. Excuse me, can I help you? - [Ross] Yeah I was just hoping to talk to Mr. Reynolds. - [Man] What am I doing? - [Ross] Yes, sir. - [Man] Well they've asked me to find out who you are and who you're with since you're filming on what they're going. - Wake up, wake up Devonda. - [Ross] She got kissed by Burt Reynolds? - Yes. - So did the mother, and so did I, I took me a kiss, I had to. [laughing] Had to get me a kiss. Devonda wake up. - Hey baby, Devonda. - [Sister] Oh she's passed right out. - Burt just knocked her out. Come on, knocked her out cold. They say any kiss like that'll know a baby out. - [Sister] That's what Burt does to all the women. [laughing] - I'm telling you, it was something. - Come on Devonda, wake up baby. He even tell, he said, control yourself. And I can't really, I'm speechless right now. - Lady was standing in my way I was about to knock her down, I had to get up there. I had to. Come on baby, wake up. Burt Reynolds kissed you, come on. - When she get's older she'll hear about it. - She sure will. Oh wake up, you're not gonna wake up, come on. - [Sister] She's cute. - Thank you. - [Ross] The production staff informs me that I'll be arrested if they catch me on the set again. [traffic rustling] Sherman came to like New York a lot. After a brief period of public humiliation, during which he was rebuked for being soft on the South, Sherman became extremely popular and returned often in New York as a public speaker. Once he told a crowd, I think we now understand what military fame is, to be killed in the field of battle and have your name spelled wrong in the newspapers. Sherman published his memoirs, and traveled all over America on what was the 19th century equivalent of a talk show circuit. Statues were erected in his honor. This one depicts Sherman in pursuit of winged victory. But Sherman sensed his days were numbered and he confided to a friend, I feel it coming sometimes when I get home from a banquet. I feel death reaching out for me as it were. I suppose I'll take cold one night and go to bed and never get up again. A month later, on February 14th, Valentine's Day 1891, Sherman died of pneumonia. The Confederate general, Joseph Johnston, who had fought the last battle against Sherman, attended Sherman's funeral. Johnston stood in the bitter cold before Sherman's coffin and was urged to put his hat back on to protect his health but he replied, If I were in Sherman's place and he were standing in mine, he would not put his hat on. A month later, Johnston himself died of pneumonia. I returned to Boston and got a job teaching filmaking. I can't say I was too happy to be back up north. On the other hand, I can't say I was too pleased about my trip down south either. Everything there had seemed slightly crazed and out of kilter. And the world as a whole seemed a much more dangerous place that it was, even a year ago, when I began filming. Also, the whole notion of actively searching for the perfect person to fall in love with now seemed foolish, and the chances of finding such a person seemed remote. Anyway, I resolved not to get involved with anyone for a while. I wanted a long period of solitude and time to pursue some other activities. I began auditing a few courses, including one in music history. - The flute, helps to recall that, and flute and soprano are often paired in bel conto. You hear them dueling, a lot in bel conto. Sometime oboe and soprano used to duel in the baroque. It gets taken over by the high, very virtuosic flute in the 19th century. All right, now the third example, yes? - [Ross] At first I tried to ignore it but I couldn't help but notice that my teacher was kind of attractive. - When she goes into the [singing smoothly], she recalls an aria tune. [classical piano playing] - [Ross] After several weeks I found myself talking to her after class. Her name was Pam, and I told her I thought she had a beautiful voice, and I asked her if she ever sang in public. ["Ode to Joy" by Ludwig van Beethoven] I sort of had a crummy seat but that's her in the chorus. Eighth row, 12th from the left. [choral singing] After the concert I thought things over, and then somewhat cautiously asked her if she's like to see a movie with me, on the following weekend. [classical orchestra music] [soft classical music] [classical music] [man opera singing] [man singing]
