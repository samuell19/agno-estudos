In three days, Anna Heegaard. The Governor-General is coming in three days. I saw the ship on the other side of the sea. Very clear. And you have told that to others, but me? Abba. Take Katka with you into the kitchen. In two hours, Mr. Governor-General. There is a matter I... Can you see your fiancé, Ms. Hammer? Why have you become so ironic? -For your sake. -For mine? - Not to bore you. - They have never bored me. - It's against the regulations. - Why throw him into the sea, captain? You can see how the rum has protected him in the heat for a whole week. The family is waiting in there. They don't even know he's dead. And then it stank of rum. Now he comes in a grave. It's better than the ocean. There is my fiancé, Heilbuth. - There are at least 20 young men. - There! - Yes. He is handsome. - I haven't seen him for eight months. The one rule king has come home. It is strange that the free negro corps has not been trooped up. Is the arrival of the Governor-General always so cheered? The welcome lasts from here to the dock. Afterwards, only the problems can be heard. Should the governor-general's grand piano or wine be off first? Yes. What shall we say now, Heilbuth? It is the first time that I have a Hornung and Moeller over here. And I'm sure that Anna has presented the wine at Bulowsminde. That is to say, it will be the governor-general's piano? The piano, yes. In Copenhagen, he said goodbye to his wife six weeks ago - - like it was the most natural thing in the world. Which it might also be, Elsebeth. - Frederick. - Brother. What did the king say? Has there been unrest? Everyone is waiting for the answer. Shall I disturb you, Governor-General? It's Andreas Bjoern at Concordia. He has been evil to his slaves. Didn't I talk to Bjoern a year ago? It is not certain that Andreas Bjoern can remember that far back. - I have to make him remember. - Thank you, massa Peter. Then my disturbance is over. In Frederiksted, people talk about - that Andreas Bjoern has shot a slave who wanted to escape. At attention! Unit, at ease. The two gentlemen are... - They are about the installments. - Installments? They were already due for payment on departure. Has the bookkeeper not paid them? You can see there. That's the welcome. In addition, there is the debt to Andreas Bjoern. Did I not say that the money will be paid on my arrival? And here you stand. May I be allowed to come ashore first? Can we pick up the money tomorrow at ten o'clock? - Of course. Did you expect anything else? - Of course not. - My customs revenues from St. Thomas. - They're in, as usual. You can see there. Money out and money in. Danish West Indies. - Do you have a lineup? - Not finished. Then see to getting it done! Until half to ten tomorrow. The sugar, Heilbuth. That's why we're here. That is why there are slaves. As long as it lasts. King Christian wants to free the slaves. What does he want? He will set the unborn slaves free. They are not good for much either. It is the king's plan that everyone who is born should be free. While their parents must remain slaves. Does he want the parents to hate their own children? The king doesn't understand life out here. It is a plan that must never come true. On our islands, all slaves must be set free. We could tear ourselves away from Denmark, von Scholten. And then you could write the national anthem. Not either, organist Pram? Then I would immediately travel home to Denmark. I always thought you liked St. Croix. - Haven't you lived here for 30 years? - Three thousand years! And it still itches. I thought you got used to the heat? It gets worse the more times you have had the fever. - Others are lucky enough to die from it. - They are scaring our new secretaries. That's my job. Heilbuth has undoubtedly heard of this place as a paradise on Earth. It is also what it is. Yes. Yes. Two of the plantation owners at Frederiksted have died of the fever. And the lessee on the Schimmelman plantations. I'll wait with the death list until I get to Governor's House. There is a meeting of the West Indian government in an hour and a half. I think you should go along, Heilbuth. I know you are tired. But you might as well get used to it all. From organist Pram to the meetings in the government. I'm not tired. I am at your disposal. I'm not tired. Tell me. What is the most important thing happening in Denmark right now? The fight for a free constitution. And what does that mean for you? Democracy. Resolution with privileges. They are revolutionaries? I am a civil servant. And now you have become secretaries of the monarchy itself. Great King. I knew you would come this way. - I thought you were busy. - I'm busy. I have sent Heilbuth down in the carriage. I haven't felt you in 11 months. There you go. I had hoped that the ship had arrived already last night. I knew you came early today. - Katka had seen it. - Katka? I don't believe in his visions. - That's your superstition, Peter. - Yes. God knows it is. Do you think we can afford to stay in your house? Ours. Is there much that is different than you expected? The heat, the light and so... The lack of order. What did you imagine? That it was a Danish island. Danish? Everything is bigger out here. In short... Astonishing. Legally, there is nothing to prevent it. The children of the slaves is set free. The slaves themselves remain unfree. - It is both a wise and brave plan. - Wise? And brave? The British treasury has had to pay outrageous sums to the plants. And the blacks aren't even satisfied with freedom. How does that seem? They are confused. They have not had schools for the children of the slaves, as we have. I would call it a jumble of freedom. There is not a single section in the law, not a single note - - to it becomes impossible to realize the king's plan. The slaves do not trawl in your papers, Kunzen, but in the field. Precisely in this case, where it is about getting the king's opinion legalised - - I find that the letters... The letters? Which are black on a white background. And therefore you assume that they resemble the slaves. Which are also black on a white background. Sir. governor general. I want to remind you that you are not an absolute king. And that the West Indies are not your private kingdom. You are not the first to tell. It should be written in flame writing above your bed. At least above the work table. I'm not mad at you, Kunzen. Nothing could be further away from me. I get fired up because the years go by and we're getting nowhere. I am reminded of the condition of the French islands. Where one is so close to a rebellion in Martinique and Guadeloupe. That is why I can say that slavery on the Danish islands must end. And that applies to all slaves. Born, as well as unborn. Has the king decided? The king must decide that. - I want to have the last recorded. - Foreword to Mr. Kunzen's back pieces! And Mr. Oxholm's neck. Then we move on to more sensible work. Black as the night in hell. That was not the case this time either. Are you not well, Pram? I have been ill for 33 years. But it's no worse than usual, if that's what you mean. For heaven's sake! The piano is not tuned yet. And the gods must know if it can keep the atmosphere. Nah... It is not a climate for such sensitive instruments as us. It occurred to me that you could play. Captain Knudsen gifted me a piano once. To get you to stay with him? I sold it because I wanted to buy my mother free. Slaves can be bought free. But there are others who can never be free. From what? From the misery our body has become. - What are they talking about? - I do not know. Maybe... ... about the hatred for myself when I allowed myself to be enslaved. Chained to an organ at St. Croix. But it is something that you cannot understand. There are things you should not entrust to a human being born of a slave. Sorry. I want a list of the punishment of slaves. - While I was absent. All over St. Croix? - Yes. May I ask the Governor-General a question? You do not need to be so formal because you have gone ashore. Of course, I'm too little informed yet... ... but there was one case that puzzled me. Speak up. I am thinking of the document His Majesty handed over to us the last day at the Castle. And surely there is something specific you are thinking about in that document? On postponing the emancipation of the slaves. "It is our intention to delay the release as long as possible." "And avoid deciding on such a costly affair." "Such an expensive affair." Is that what you were thinking? I was surprised that you did not submit the king's order to the other members. I wouldn't give Oxholm and Kunzen such good cards. I mean... The king sits in Denmark. Kunzen sits in his law books. There are not that many of us who are on the West Indian islands. I want the list of sickness and deaths among the soldiers. And ask that accountant to come up with a statement of customs revenues! - Where is Anna? - In her room. Anna! I didn't expect you until it got dark. The West Indies Government. Everything is as it was when I left 11 months ago. What did you expect? That something had changed. That there was a flamboyant tree in the meeting hall. That someone had suddenly become wonderfully gifted. Oxholm for example. But nothing has changed. Not even one has died. The bell ringer in the Lutheran church has died. Is that the only change? Are we to accept that death is the only thing that changes life? No. I don't think we should settle. Sir. governor general. Life is heavy as a coffin layer. By the way, I heard you call me Governor-General. The more you go to Denmark, Peter... The more you look like someone from Denmark when you return. - What do you mean? - You have put yourself inside their thoughts. You know their reservations. You go out of yourself and into them to understand them. Otherwise, I don't know who to fight against. You don't talk about action. I cannot abolish slavery. I have never seen your wife and children. I have never seen your king. But when you're here, Peter... ... not only don't I want to see your back - - while your whole front, your face and your hands are back in Copenhagen. Will you love and honor her? And live with her through thick and thin? In what happiness God almighty sends you? As a married man lives with his common-law wife - - till death do you part? Yes. Likewise, I urge you, Regitze Erenhardt Hammer. Do you want Ivar Mikael Lawaetz, who stands with you - to husband? Yes. Will you love and honor him? And live with him in ups and downs - - as a common-law wife must live with her husband... -... until death do you part? - Yes. Then give each other the hand. So I now declare you to be married people. Both for God and people. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. It's a bad time to meet, Buddo. You promised an answer. I can't keep that promise. Not this time. There is a bad rumor. That the children must have their freedom, but not the parents. The king must make another decision. If I should go over there again. The king must make another decision. If I should go over there again. The slaves talk of fire and knife. And the whites talk about gunpowder and cannons. - It's a bad conversation. - And now. What happens? Now I'm going to a wedding. I am the godfather of the groom. Yes, it's true! Do you know that the Danish King has moved into us, at 'William's Delight?' No, you have never revealed that before, Mrs. Holten. The king has moved into the main building. I settle in the grue-kettle. Vilhelm moves to the sugar mill. Can't you let the breeze freshen it up a bit? It is the misfortune of the times, Dorothea. Who spoke of the favor of the times when things were going well? William did not. He didn't even talk about my favor. It was beginning to tire him. Now we are indebted to above the highest palm leaf- - and the king has a part on the entire plantation. It is a sad time. It's not your husband's fault. The indebt applies to almost all plantations on St. Croix. And sugar prices are falling and falling. Come closer, come closer, sweet children. Now stay here by my chair. I don't bite. God bless you, my child. You have to get used to both husband and troop heat at once. One of the things could be enough to take the life of a sensitive person. Now give Mrs. Regitze your hand. That's my husband. Vilhelm Ludvig Holten. How pale you are, my child. Tell Ivar to be careful with you. And thank you for coming, Mrs. Holten. That you both came. Well, of course we came. right, Vilhelm? Never forget to tell him when you love him. - Well, I love him. - It comes and goes. Always remember to tell him when it comes. It was not many years ago that we never saw negroes among the guests. In reality, we are known or infamous on many of the other islands. To have black women at the companies? It came from Scholten. But the result is that some of the plants' wives never participate. Strangely enough, there are also black women who do not want to come. They are the most sensitive. It is a kind of formation of the heart. No, thanks. Now I don't know whether it is for them to think of yours? I think Mr. Heilbuth is excellent in that direction. Quite honestly, since I landed on St. Croix, I have thought mine. I am pleased. May I ask for a dance with your wife? They have my permission. I can't give you anything else. They look so serious today. And not trace ironically. - Are you bored of them? - Yes. I mean no. Of course I'm not bored. The next dance. It is so cleansing for good Christian men - - that the blacks had never had a chance - - if we had not taken them across the sea. They had probably managed. Where God had put them. Where? Sorry to intrude, but there's something I've been thinking about. What does it mean that God has not made me black? But you are an organist. What if God has made every other white person black under the skin? And every other black, white? We don't understand you. What if you, Kirsten Sverdrup, and I are both white-skinned blacks? - And lazy as animals! - Now you are insolent. In reality I should be whipped for my laziness. For example up on your plantation, Mr. Sverdrup. My husband will never hit a white man. He could easily do that now that I was black. I am black. I am only wearing a wrong skin. Mrs. Lawaetz. You have to get used to being called something else. I am content to call you Regitze when I think of you. They know it themselves. Two people cannot talk together like we did. l almost six weeks, Regitze. Without it bearing fruit. If I didn't care for you, I would have hit you by now. Wish you had. Then I would have been very close to you at that moment. Do you remember that evening on the deck when we watched the Southern Cross? No, I don't remember that night. - They are heartless. - I only have one heart. - Thanks for the dance. - Thank you, Secretary Heilbuth. What an honor. I thought we would bump into each otherr eventually, Andreas Bjoern. Does this mean that the Governor General will finally pay his debt? If it doesn't mean that we will seek you out at Concordia in another area. Which? There have been three complaints that you mistreat your slaves. - The last one is fresh. - They can buy my whip. I am sure that the price is exactly what you owe. Cheers for the freedom of our children. While we ourselves can go to the grave as slaves. We don't cheer. We are waiting. We sit completely still and wait. We learned that from Buddo. My son must not dance when the King has decreed that I must not. Yes. I will have to go up to Concordia. Andreas Bjoern has not understood that he must leave the island - if he continues to mistreat his people. They have agreed to be at the slave school at one o'clock. Then I'll be there. - I could... - No, the slave schools are mine. I take care of Andreas Bjoern, and then I go to school. They must look after the morning meeting. The accountant has been here with the settlement of excess customs revenues. There is something I don't understand. The customs office at St. Thomas... It was the first I had out here. I got it from the old king. But your name still stands. I cannot afford to dispense with that office. As a royal custom? After you were appointed governor-general? You will probably be surprised by the small shovel of official appointments - in which we all have to fall trees in. I'm not surprised. Allow me to say it straight. I am outraged. Then it will not be the last time you get the opportunity to be outraged. We talked to you last week. This morning there is another complaint. The fourth, Andreas Bjoern. - Who filed the complaint? - I want to see Mingo. - He is in the field. - A manual slave? I want to see him here! He can't be here until well past noon. I warn you. Perhaps I have no right to punish my slaves? Just as I have the right to recover my debt. They have no right to abuse. Who sent for you? Mingo asks if massa Peter wants to see him. He cannot come himself. He's just doing comedy. Lets himself fall over dead if it suits him. What's up, Mingo? - It's not from the whip. - Mister Bjoern used a knife. He made it himself. - That wound there? - Or so has his girl. When were you in the fields? I have never been in the fields. Whoever made it knows how to use a sugar knife. Anyone could have done it. They can't prove anything. There will be no further warnings from the Government House. This time it will be an inquiry. I've held my own in a courtroom. We are almost full today because Mr. Governor-General was supposed to come. Martha Johanna. Do you want to go up and write the table of five? Us, you can't make free, Massa Peter. And you want to take my son away from me. Now I myself have given him freedom. No. No. No. Come. Andreas Bjoern is dead. - Who is dead? - Andreas Bjoern. At Concordia. - I just spoke to him. - He died an hour later. And what was the cause of death? The fever, says the messenger. The fever. Should the fever have taken Andreas Bjoern in the course of an hour? The body has been brought to the fort in Frederiksted. It's not the fever, Heilbuth. Poison? Which poison? It is too early to answer, but a plant extract. - So the poison of the blacks? - One has to assume that. The dead boy and Andreas Bjoern. What's going on? - What do you think yourself? - It encourages them. What in heaven's name do you mean? It encourages them with all the death and destruction. Is it a friend or an official speaking? - An official. - I have had an idea for a while. I don't think you can hear the music out here. You can read the sheet music, but I think you are tone deaf. - Thanks for the grades. - And vulnerable. National liberal and vulnerable. They wonder what is happening. Things are becoming so clear that the king and the government can see them. When a man is shot, there is always another man standing far away - - and pulls the trigger. - Far away. - What do you mean? It is the same way when you have to sail across the sea - - for something to happen at St. Croix. It is something else when a man kills with a sugar knife. Then he has to be close to the one he kills. Anna! I think I hate all your distance when you kill. And when you rule. Is that you, Heilbuth? I thought it was my brother. I saw that there was light here. I am on my way to Frederiksted. You must then have felt overburdened with work. It's almost midnight. I am investigating the sale of the state's plantations. Aha. And what result do you come to? Irregularities to say the least. I can hardly believe that. I have found four plantations that have not been sold by statutory auction. They know exactly why. What should we call it? Favoritism. Corruption. We all know who treats the slaves like animals. And at a public auction my brother cannot prevent them from buying. While the lucky elements feel tempted to give a share. A good phase rarely comes without costs. Good luck, Mr. Heilbuth. My head... ... hurts. Little Regitze. Little Regitze. Why should I believe you this time? I do not say that I will return with the king's answer. I will return with the answer. And the answer is that all slaves will be free. The only other option is the carnage. It will not be a black, that starts. Not while you're awake. But do you even trust your white friends? He must claim the promise from them. A powder. It's the stomach. Sour or hard? Both. Out here you get both sour and hard. Are you here? I live here. - Mostly sour. - Sour. I can't understand why people go to church so much. Here there are ten times as many medications. Each thing in its time. See how little the wedding has helped Regitze Lawaets. - Regize? - Yes. She's got the fever. What do they want? I had to come. Now you go, Heilbuth. No one has called you. The situation demands that I appeal to the King one last time. I am traveling to Copenhagen. There is only one requirement. Increased military preparedness. Just like on Martinique and Guadeloupe. We must seek help. No foreign troops should be involved in this. Danish soldiers are safe soldiers. Perhaps a little untrained in slave uprisings. There will be no riots on St. Croix. Why not declare the King's idea as law? Does anyone understand what happens if I do that? Does no one understand that? No. Nobody. Heilbuth, I would like to talk to you. - Now? - Right now. We go to my place. I was truly saddened to hear of Regitze Lawaet's death. Yes. Of course it's none of my business, but I have eyes to see. There are probably more of us, who have been saddened. But of course that wasn't why I dragged you in here, Heilbuth. I have an offer to make you. Will you accept the position as royal agent at St. Thomas? - At St. Thomas? - They know the importance of the office. And you would like to see me at St. Thomas? Do you think they are there to get rid of you? Why not? You know my opinion of your official conduct. Yes, I know that one. And then you think you can send me to another island... - under the guise of a better office. I can dismiss you from the office you now hold with the snap of a finger. A royal proxy, on the other hand, is a civil servant. And can only be dismissed by the government in Denmark. Can I consider my situation? A little while longer. We can also arrange your affairs in another way. - What do you mean? - You can get a side income here. It will bring you around 6,000 per year. Yes. Let's say it. 6,000. And you allow yourself to offer me that? They can save you money. Why do you think I did you that favor. Because I know where I have you. I wanted to take you by the wing bone before you fly away with all the crumbs. A report is sent to the chancellery with the same ship. It won't be the only one. - Also from you? - We have a diligent man among us. Is it for the General Customs Chamber? An even more powerful body. The Copenhagen press. So you are going to cross that ocean again, dear von Scholten? Yes. And you must send Regitze on her last journey. Yes. Everyone who dies is younger than me. And what should you put in it? That you are forgotten. It's people like you and me who stay behind. Not you, I don't like you, Vilhelm. Not in the long run. St. Croix overgrown with rainforest. And Pram and I sit in the middle of the island like two old ruins. It's completely quiet. The sugar mills have stopped. Peter von Scholten has left. And the slaves have gone home to Africa. Dorothea... Yes, sorry. It will soon pass. I think it's because Regitze died. I came to like her - - and that must be taken into account. You have to be careful if you can. But what if you can't? Then it goes like this. They disappear. - It is a bitter moral. - Then it's probably true. My happiness is that I have found Vilhelm. I don't love him, and then I'm sure he'll stay here. I don't love him, and then I'm sure he'll stay here. Yes. Yes. I'll stay, Dorothea. Can't you play a piece on the grand piano, Vilhelm Holten? The piano has lost its mood. It is a question of whether it finds it again. - Katka came. - For you? No, to you, but you don't believe him. What do you say? Over the ocean. The man to the right of the chair is evil. The man to the right of the chair. Thank you, Katka. Since you can see everything that is going to happen - - so tell me... When will Pram die? Pram. It is me. I do not tell anyone that you practice witchcraft. It's so good to see you in the house, Dad. I can't get used to the Danish weather. Think that you can long for warmth. You should have brought a piece of sun with you from St. Croix. In a salt barrel, what? Was it an exhausting meeting? Like snow showers. First from the east, then from the west. But the trip was beautiful. You have made many enemies. Do they talk to you about it too? Then it's worse than the last time I was at home. I'm used to having enemies, Lise. I have as many enemies over there as there are horse-drawn carriages in Copenhagen. We are so far from it out there. Your family lives in a different world. Sometimes I wish it was all over. What do you mean by 'was over?' The newspapers write that you act as if you were autocratic. And it's going out of style, dad. A person who wants what is right never goes out of style. The liberals are not your friends. The liberals give a damn about the slaves. You love the king and the slaves. The upper ones and the lower ones. But it is only those in the middle who move. St. Croix is ​​not a mirror image of Denmark. Over there, everything in the middle is standing still. Completely silent. - We have to be at the theater in 45 minutes. - It's Mrs. Heiberg tonight. Mrs. Heiberg me here and Mrs. Heiberg me there. Shall I ask them to lay out the uniform? It's tomorrow, that matters. You are going to the King? I have never brought a more serious bequest to your Majesty. In the truest sense of the word, we live out there between fire and water. Thank you for your speech, dear Scholten. Their words are as much intended to go to the heart as to the brain. Perhaps Schlangenbusch from the Danish Chancellery will explain - for the commission's thoughts in connection with the freeing of the slaves. May I first allow myself to supplement Your Majesty. The commission I represent is not set up by the chancellery - - but by the General Customs Chamber. Also? There are two civilizational driving forces that we would like to shed light on. - Throw. - Immediately, Your Majesty. There are two things that will especially help the poor negro - - toward civilization. - One is marriage. - And the other? The second is the creation of savings banks. What minds conceived this, Your Majesty? Representatives from the church, the military, the school system - the trade and therefore the General Customs Chamber. Yes. I thought so. I look at it this way, that marriage binds the soul. In the same way as the savings bank binds matter. It is the first step on the road to civilization. It is possible that von Scholten will get more out of the commission's work - - when the report is completely finished. I shall be the last to contradict your Majesty. I have been looking forward to you meeting the man at my side. Captain Irminger - - which has taken a big hit on the Danish coast in Guinea. Where the negroes had laid siege to the royal fort Prinsensten. But with the Eagle he destroyed the village of Kitty as late as the autumn. On the 18th of October at dawn, Your Majesty. Yes. We have heard of that bloody day. No one in the kingdom wishes death upon the negroes. It wasn't dead either, Your Majesty. It was discipline. Nevertheless, I have understood that the blacks died from it. Of course they died. Not all in the village. But our bullets razed the larger houses in an excellent manner. Or cabins. How many had to die, Captain Irminger? Yeah, I wasn't ashore to count - - but let me put it this way. Enough died. We have decided to send Captain Irminger and the Eagle to St. Croix. I will certainly be inhospitable to the... ... guests, your majesty gets me on the neck. Captain Irminger will not stay out there as a guest. He will be directly under your command in case of disturbances. We are not used to talking with cannons in the West Indian islands. May I make one thing clear to you, my dear Scholten. The reports we have from the West Indies tell us that the situation is serious. The plantation owners complain. The civil servants complain. You may have your reasons for correcting your being... Yes, all your heart with the negroes. But I must remind you that it is the manufacture of sugar - there is a reason why Denmark is in the West Indies. The freedom can never precede the sugar. And must never burden the Danish treasury with a deficit. I am an officer in the Governor-General's service - - from the moment The Eagle approaches St. Croix. It shouldn't be profitable to free the slaves! From that point of view, it is cheaper to slaughter them! You're getting fired up, Dad. Your blood can't take it. I can't stand it. No. I can't stand it. One of our friends stuck it under the door. Half an hour ago. Friends? Or what we should call such a bid. He probably wouldn't be recognized. And what is it that the Fatherland is writing this time? They write about Anna Heegaard. About you and Anna Heegaard. It's no secret. Neither over there nor in Copenhagen. Still, it is perhaps easier to wear, as long as it is not printed. They write that you force visitors to meet Anna Heegaard. That white men have to kiss a colored woman on the hand. Despite the prevailing prejudices. Not despite. Because of the prevailing prejudices. And then they write that it is for public outrage - - because it is precisely the governor-general who has to set the tone. Well then. Then I set the tone. Did you expect anything else? I know you. I didn't expect anything else. You and I live in Denmark. That's how you wanted it after you'd been over there. Lise. Anna and I live on St. Croix. And none of the three of us lose love. We would only do that if there were fewer than three of us. You would, Dad. Catherine... Your father is a man who desires. But he can also stretch himself far. That's also how I came to love him. I have seen you cry, mother. Neither your father nor I want to live invisibly. Do you know what we are doing? Do you know what we'll do with those dog heads? We're having a party. Like in the old days. Now? After all that? Yes. Now. After all that. Thats how it should be. They gave us the resentment. And now we give them the pleasure of reciprocation. We discover in the mist a large canoe coming towards us. We send a ball off, but it lands in the pond. The natives are so frightened that 10-12 of them jump into the sea. And of course they couldn't swim. But then there was peace? - Not so simple. - No, it's not that simple. I am sure you will appreciate our rum. In the navy we drink brandy. When we drink. I think you should stick to that. You don't have to change habits like that. The man to the right of the chair. What? Irminger sat to the right of the King's chair. What does it mean? Superstition. Dear Scholten and Mrs. There aren't many left, so it's worth holding a dignified and cheerful party. Right, Caroline? And so I like the little West Indian flavor in the food. Most of it comes from South America. - Oh really? - Like the potato. The potato? I thought it was domestic. No. No more domestic than syphilis. It also comes from over there. Christian! - Am I not right, Scholten? - Sure. Whether you want it or not. Yes. Then you can wonder how it ended up in Europe. Christian... We are among world citizens, Caroline. At least Peter von Scholten and I are citizens of the world. But we women are not used to your world language. We can get used to it, Your Majesty. In this house, you are used to the worst. Listen, it's true, Scholten. I have a date for you. You know what I mean. It must be on Caroline's birthday. The Queen's birthday. The 28th of June itself. The 28th of June. That's how we decided, yes. From that day on, all newborns will be free. Yes, and now we're going home, Caroline. Thanks. On our Queen's celebrated birthday - - has King Christian the 8th proclaimed... Based on the motives of justice - have we decided that the ownership of slaves must cease - - but in order to be able to make the necessary preparations - - will this decree enter into force - - 12 years from this date. Now they are burying your old dream. In all the churches. All over the island. Our dream. I didn't go to the other side of the world to ask for freedom. Based on the motives of justice - and for the welfare of our West Indian colonies - - we hereby decide - - that the power over the slaves, which the owners have - - must cease. It is our highest wish - - that the children of slaves - - born after this date must be free. However, they must remain with their parents. Where do they come from? Christiansted. A depeche from Guadaloupe has been included. I don't know how important it is. It is not that important. Heilbuth... I am well aware that it is you who are behind the articles in the newspaper in Copenhagen. Yes. I could of course name you my enemy. I could fire you or promote you - - and send you to St. Thomas. But I didn't think that. I have decided to let you stay where you are. It will only humiliate one of us. You won't shut me up, Mr. Governor-General. No. I know. You did not overturn the King's wish. Do you believe me when I say I understand you? No. At least you're honest. On the French islands the anger is even greater than here. - None has used fire or knives yet. - That's what I want to tell. If it does not cost black blood, it must not cost white either. I hope they understand that on the French islands. You should think so, Governor-General. What is it? Big King? Stay here! Come on. Big King. What did I do wrong? What in heaven's name have I done wrong? - It's been 12 years, Peter. - It's the King. No. It is 12 years. It is you. I have always wanted to prepare for their freedom. How many years then? How many years is enough? How many years then? How many years is enough? Once 12 years was perhaps right. A long time ago. And now? On January 5th at ten o'clock the King boarded the corvette Valkyrie. He laid down his cloak and stood bareheaded as he spoke to the crew. It was all quiet on the ship, gentlemen. And it's freezing 16 degrees. Later that afternoon, the King falls ill. His physician orders an venipuncture, but the wound becomes inflamed. And on the evening of January 20, His Majesty dies. Honor the memory of King Christian. Our new king Frederik the 7th signed eight days later - - certain citizens' demands for a free constitution. With a single stroke of the pen he abolished the one rule, gentlemen. Certain citizens' demands you say? They liberalize. Now we get a real parliament. The Danes will be free. What does it look like inside a liberal who wants to give white people the right to vote? While the blacks still have to live like animals. - I can live with that contradiction. - Undoubtedly. They also live in an ink house, where the light never gets in. The duchies are already talking about riots. - Against Denmark? - Against Denmark. Everything dissolves. Then I go down and give orders to the fort to announce the King's death. I would like to make a brief announcement to the West Indies Government. I have found one of my dogs with its throat cut. Wrapped in the Danish flag. In case of riots, we have the war brig the Eagle lying outside here. Under my command. I have no doubt that the rebellion on Guadeloupe is a reality. I'm more uncertain about Martinique. I don't want to hear rumours. I want to hear the facts. The Governor General of Puerto Rico has promised... The worst imaginable... Murder. Fire. Rebellion. On Guadeloupe and Martinique. I no longer feel like participating in the meal. Flora. Help organist Pram into the yellow room. I can't bear to lie down. I go in and tune the grand piano. These horrors are one thing. And then Puerto Rico presumes to offer me military help. As if we were a French government. A moment ago you yourself spoke of your anxiety that the riot should spread. When I came in here with this letter, something happened. I became confident in my case. The rebellion will not come to St. Croix. Nowhere in the West Indies do the blacks have such good conditions. In this place, the distance between black and white is so short. And nowhere do the slaves have such deep trust in their governor-general. That's enough for me. If you reach out for a single soldier - - then you get a whole army. France arranges its relations with guns. But there are other ways. How long has it been since I saw you like tonight. It is strange. It is as if St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. Jan - - is becoming an independent kingdom. And the time it lasts. The moment our kingdom exists - - I will have to take responsibility as if I were a king. The last one ruling. It's probably a good thing there's no one else who hears you but me. But you hear me. I'm going to St. Thomas tomorrow to make sure it's calm. I'll be back in three days. My carriage is waiting for me in Frederiksted. Then I'll wait in Frederiksted. And there is peace as long as I am away? Yes. Certain? I'm more confident than when you last promised us something. We will be forced to act as if we were brothers. One black and one white. And you want to call me brother? What else? General? See you in three days. What time are we in Frederiksted? The wind takes us straight to Christiansted. My car is waiting for me in Frederiksted. - But then we have to cross up against the wind. - Yes. Are you worried that everything will not be as it was when we left? If the Governor-General's presence in Frederiksted is necessary... I have to tell you something about seamanship. When the wind is due south, you can lie straight across to Frederiksted. That's why my car is waiting there. At this time of year, it makes the journey 3-4 hours shorter. Today we can save just as many hours by calling Christiansted. Well, you know what we're doing, Captain Irminger? We go to Christiansted. Can I offer to get you a vehicle? They must not cause you any trouble. I'm going to the government house. It is as peaceful here as in a Danish village. That's what I said. Everything breathes calm and peace at St. Croix. My compliments, Mr. Governor General. My deepest compliment. We must have access to one of the houses' balconies - - to give us an overview. The pharmacist lives right here, Andreson. Warn the pharmacist. - This is what I have always feared. - Me too, Chief of Police. You know what goes through my head all the time? The tune my daughter played on the piano this afternoon. It's like I'm not here at all. Then I think you should decide to arrive. Chief of Police! Now there seems to be a bid for you, chief of police. Should I talk to them? - What should I say? - It will come when you stand there. They have no right to wear a uniform. Come down here. The Governor-General has appointed me a general. Notify Peter von Scholten. I do not take orders from a former slave. Then accept mine. I'll do it myself. I ask the major to send for my brother. Then nothing bad happens to any white man. Go home, police chief. And drink two glasses of rum. But no more than two. Let me say that again. The Eagle must leave for Frederiksted. The Eagle stays in Christiansted. We must mark our position towards the rebels. Our weakness, you mean? What do you mean, Major Falbe? We are fully prepared in Christiansted. Enough to protect the city should the rebellion spread? That is my firm belief. Perhaps we should sound the alarm from the fort, Major Falbe? To notify the militia. - Two times two cannon shots. - I will oppose that. One could quietly send a message to the militia to be ready. To avoid the war? It is from Frederiksted. No bloodshed. And no violence. Also, my brother is just repeating what we know from the previous commandment. No violence? Slaves breaking free from their owners. Isn't that violence? The plantation owners have always treated Peter von Scholten as slaves. Permit me to tell you, gentlemen, whence I felt that the violence was most threatening. From here. The Government House in Christiansted. Allow me to express my contempt, Mr. Governor-General. - Your what? - Not for you, Mr. General. But for their hesitation, which I consider cowardice and treason. I am a governor before I am a general. And I consider my children to be above your rank and file. Besides, it's only me who decides - - how this situation avoids developing as in the French islands. - And afterwards? - Afterwards. Am I the only one to be judged for my actions? Denmark's last absolute king. A man like you, Heilbuth, has convinced me that it is necessary. And now, gentlemen. I go in and lie down in my office. Yes? Who sent you? The Governor-General's brother. Your carriage is on its way here. They must come to Frederiksted. Merchant Moore's house is burnt down. Why do you do that? Why the hell is that happening? - I'm not doing anything. - You burn the city down. Only Merchant Moore's house because he shouted to the soldiers to shoot. - Where is the merchant now? - On the ship. Along with the police chief. General Buddo says we shouldn't tear down any more houses. - General? - That's how it is now. Tell my brother that I will come as soon as the carriage has arrived. He must wait by the road from the driveway to Diamond. On the road. Diamond. The brig the Eagle, Mr. Governor-General. The brig the Eagle leaves for Frederiksted. - And? - And awaiting further orders! There is no other way. Not now. Not like that here. I have seen you travel to Denmark to plead the cause of the slaves. But every time you approached Copenhagen - - then the planter started talking out of your mouth. The one who owned the blacks and could decide. You gave the plantation owners year after year. But it was the slave schools, Frederik. I thought that too for a long time. - But then... - So what? Then one day I realized that the long training they had to go through- - before you had the courage to grant them freedom... It was your special way of making them white. Should I, of all people, want to make the blacks white? Yes. Exactly. You. You love them so unconditionally. So indiscriminate. Although the slaves were freed in the English Isles. Even though they murdered freely on the French. You had your picture of the black man walking into the white land. It was supposed to take 12 years. Freedom now! Freedom now! That will be it now. Frederick. Now. You are hereby emancipated! You are free now! You are free now! But I am asking you to go home. Go home! Return home! We are free! Return home! We are free! The release is against all orders and promises. Against common sense. Against the King's wishes. What happened now had to happen. And you already knew it last night. I can only blame myself for not being prepared either. However, they have blacks in the house. Yes, in your bed, Peter von Scholten. Gentlemen, you must excuse me. I must rest. In the morning I go round to the plantations to see if everything is as it should be. Does this mean that no one knows what happened on the plantations? My brother has ridden around Frederiksted with Buddo. Together with a traitor? Without Buddo, Frederiksted would have burned to the ground. So they concede? That we can thank Buddo that no human was killed? Yes. We are many witnesses to this conversation. What happened here? Can't you see it? I'm the only one who has held on. Who got hurt here, Mrs. Holten? Actually, it is Vilhelm's birthday. Forty of our own slaves. What do you mean? They didn't like the old terrace. Now I couldn't either. Then I said that I gave them freedom. The slaves stood up and stared and clapped their hands. Mostly for me. Even though it is Vilhelm's birthday. But Vilhem just sat and shook his head and cried. Then he drank three glasses of wine straight after another, and then I asked him to go. Peter? The Governor General must remain calm. Will you notify the West Indies Government? Right now? Peter von Scholten must be released from all obligations. For now. - You must go to Frederiksted again. - Now? It is necessary. Irminger lies there with his ship. A temporary government, Peter von Scholten, has been formed. Kunzen is Acting Governor General. Yes. It is necessary. Should we call the doctor? I want to see Anna. Brings me to Bulowsminde. As the situation is... The plantation owners... There is unrest... But maybe somewhere else? - On neutral ground. - On neutral ground, Governor-General. Are you traveling now? Why, Peter? When I had said those words in Frederiksted- - I discovered that there was no more. I had made myself abundant, Anna. I thought I was going to die. No. For several hours I thought I was dead. Why didn't you send for me? When I disappeared, you weren't there anymore either. I'm here. Think of all that there is to do now. All that there is to talk about. Not for me. But for you, yes. - I will be living at Bulowsminde. - Yes. You also own almost every single beam in that house. My mother is moving in and the family from La Grange. I want the house full of people. It is well. Then I know what it looks like when I think of you. I'm going now, Peter. PETER VON SCHOLTEN WAS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL TO DENMARK, SENTENCED OF NECLECT HONOR AND OFFICE.
