Come on in. I'll be right with you. - Can you do me a cane liquor? - Sure thing. Okay if I make a call to Montevideo, Chief? - Go ahead. - I'll pay you, of course. 'Morning. Yes. A call to the capital. Number's 25926. Thanks. Hello? Hello? Yes, it's me. No, I'm in Lavalleja. No, I don't know when I'll be back. I don't know, I tell you But... I don't know. - Let me do the talking, will you! - 'Morning, Don Chicho. 'Morning, Rataplan. How ya doing? Fine, fine. - Day's warming up, already. - Didn't notice. Hear you're going on a trip. Yes, and how are you? New faces in town. That's nice. Get me another one, Chief. Brings bad luck, drinking on your own. That's what they say. Excuse me. Chief, one for my friend here! That's better. Not from around these parts, are you? That's right. Not from around here. Come from far away, have you? - That depends. - It would do. Seems people here are up early even on Sundays. No, see today's a very special day. A very special Sunday. We're off on a trip, going to see the sea. That's nice. And what beach are you going to? Is there more than one? Sure thing. Never looked at the map? The what? The map of Uruguay, never seen it? Not all of it, no. See, me here, don't know an awful lot about it. Uruguay's full of beaches. All on the coast. Yes, well... beaches do tend to be along the coast. There are all sorts of them. Ones with rocks, ones without rocks... Wide beaches... with fine white sand... and dunes. Or else others which are narrow. Long but narrow Ones with rough waves, calm ones without a wave in sight... The coast of Uruguay's full of beaches, covered in them. Guess it must be. Rodriguez is taking us. Rodriguez? Who's he? Don't know Rodriguez? He's lived here over thirty years! 'Morning, Quintana! 'Morning, Don Chicho! - 'Morning. - 'Morning. - 'Morning, Seven-plus-three! - How ya doing? At it already, are you? - Can't turn down a kind invitation. - Quite right. Meet my friend here. Just arrived in town. It's a pleasure. All off to the seaside, are you? And how would you know?. My buddy here told me. You sure make friends fast. Can I offer you a cane liquor? You bet. Yes, Sir. Just one thing, though... And no offence meant. It's just something... You're sitting on Rodriguez's chair. He'll be here in a minute. - Sorry, I didn't know. - That's okay. I'll move at once. Chief! Serve us a round, will you! Wasn't that Rodriguez's chair? Yes, but I have to look after it. - Never seen the sea either? - No. Funny thing, but no... Always meant to go, see? But what with one thing or another.. I never got there. Kept putting it off... Truth is, I've never been... Hardly ever left town, really. No idea, not the faintest, about the sea. Rodriguez is taking us, in his truck, says the sea's really something... spectacular, mind-boggling... Time to check it out myself. Move these please, gents. Gotta clean up. Always the same. Only ever cleans when there's visitors. And what have we here in this dinky little package? When has the old lady ever forgotten her friends? She's sent some meat patties for the journey. Excuse me. Excuse me. - It's... - Excuse me. Two left! - I had seven. - Do you mind! - That's what they're there for. - Give some to our friend there! - Take one. - No, there's only one left. You have it. I've already eaten. Don't be polite. - Thanks a lot. - Please. Your health! Something I'd like to ask you. In the sea, is there anything worth fishing? Catfish, perch...? I mean, worth taking a rod, is it? No catfish or perch because the sea's salty. - Plenty of sharks, though. - Oh, Jeez! No! Won't be easy to load a shark on the truck. Going to be complicated. Not to mention putting it on a table to strip its scales off! - No kidding! - You said it... Excuse me, but no scales. Sharks don't have scales. - They don't? - They have skin. Have to peel it then, like a peach. In one go! What's a peach got to do with a shark? Nothing like it. Sharks don't have stones. Hey, cut it out! This fella's going to think you only get up early to talk crap. Don't worry. I was like that when I was a kid. Sounds like the fella's got you taped. If Rodriguez gets anywhere near a shark, they'll forget all about this passion to see the sea. You mark my words. Talk of the devil, here they all are. 'Morning, folks. Grab your stuff 'cause we're leaving. It's been a pleasure, friend. Same here. - Let's go, Aquino. - Quintana, I'll take this for you. Come along. Come along, Aquino. Hi there, Vasco! Did you bring the barbecue? It's in the back. What are you up to, Vasco? You the navigator, are you? Come on, it's getting late. He dawdles with his old lady and now he's in a hurry. Excuse me? Hi, Rodriguez. Shall I sweep up a bit or are we travelling like chickens? We're travelling like chickens. Ah, Quintana. It's going to be a helluva hot day If we aren't careful, we'll peel. - Are you going to get on or not? - We're getting on. Let me ask you something, Rodriguez. Is this trip really going to be worth the trouble? What's up? Don't you wanna see the sea? Sure I do. You bet. - Well, get on the truck. - We're getting on. - For crying out loud! - We're getting on. Get on with it, man! Get on the truck! What do I owe you, Chief? Three pesos. - I'll take a bottle of liquor too. - Fine. That'll be 8 pesos altogether. Shut up, Aquino. He's a friend. What are you doing? What are you doing here? I'm going with you to see the sea. What for? You've already seen it. To see how it looks to you. Great fella, that Eye-talian! - Like a swig? - Think I will. - Your health! - And plenty of it! If we keep swigging this stuff, this heat'll finish us. What a pain in the ass, that dog! Easy, Aquino. Aquino! Aquino! You spilled it on the dog! Easy, Aquino. Easy. - What you staring at? - Nothing. - What d? ya mean, nothing? - Nothing. - But something's up? What is it? - Nothing, I tell you. I don't get it. Why d? ya want to take this load of animals to see the sea? Why d? ya have to get it? Who asked you your opinion, Vasco? Yes you, I'm talking to... - What about me? - Do me a favour! Nice dog. What's his name? Aquino. Like the last cattle rustler, Martin Aquino. So why Aquino? 'Cause he always slips through? No. 'Cos when he sees a military uniform, he goes straight for it. Got a family, have you? No. Just me and him. And this is Rataplan. Hi there. My father used to collect the "Rataplan" magazine. What's the magazine got to do with it? He's the king of the stiff broom. The garbage collector. The garbage man, see. Somebody's got to pick it up, they're all great at dumping it, but then they say, hey! Let's get this swept up, and suddenly they've all vamoosed. So who's left? Rataplan. Ain't that the way it is? Rataplan. Sounds nice. How that dog bugs me! Aquino! Easy, Aquino! Cut it out, will ya! What's up, Quintana? - Don't you like dogs or something? - Let me get some sleep! We gotta long way to go. Trouble is, you got no appreciation, Quintana. No appreciation. You ain't got no dog, eh? What do I want a dog for? What d? ya mean, what for? Just to have one. Why do people have dogs? If it's just to have one, there's no point. Hold on a minute. How come you never go to the bar, eh? What for? What d? ya mean, what for? To play a hand of cards with us and to have a few drinks. And end up on the pavement, fighting. Got a woman, have you? - No you ain't got a woman. - What for? To fill the place with kids? But you gotta have some kind of fun, Quintana. Why don't you leave me alone! Lots of fun living the way I live. See what a lovely breeze? Ain?t seen no air, no. Jeez, you're all so funny today! - Cool it, Rodriguez. - I am cool, Vasco. What I mean is, and you may not get it, I mean, in the countryside there's this clean, fresh air, not like in town. Countryside's something else. Mind you, miles of countryside, miles of it but not a soul in sight. Well, see now, you look and, sure, you don't see a soul. But there are people there, you gotta believe me. Miles away, but they're there. - Believe me they are. - Far away. Yeah. Excuse me. And in that cemetery over there, which part has the most flowers? Well now, let me explain. There's most flowers in the part where the "little angels" are. Not flowers, really, sweet-smelling herbs: Rue... lemon grass... etc. Mothers will be mothers. Then next comes the men's part. Less flowers than for the "little angels", but there are some. - Which the women bring? - Who else? Of course. Then in the women's part, there ain't one fucking flower. Come on. We're worse shits than the women, do I make myself clear? We men are a fucking disaster, we're... Death is eternal. It's something... which never ends. And what's your opinion? We've all got skeletons in the cupboard. You...? You killed someone, my friend? So many things die. And this one's not got long left either. Finish it off, Quintana! I like it 'cos you drive nice and slow. Never did understand people who drive like crazy. Truck's on its last legs anyway. Truck's still going strong. Goes like a bird, eh? I'd rather get there alive than dead, unlike some. That's for sure. But you now, you goes slowly but surely, takes your time, stops a bit, gets down, lights up a cigarette, looks around and sees what you left behind. - You mean, what's already gone. - Sure. 'Cos all the driver sees is what lies ahead. But the real journey, is really what's behind you. Then one day, you tell your buddies about it, and it all comes back to you, clear as crystal. And then maybe you even feel like going back again. How about a little sing-song, something we all know?. I got one. It goes like this... Whathisname used to sing it... Hey, Quintana, you got one? I remember one or two, but kinda half remember, bits of 'em. - Go on then... - Married to a Uruguayan, he was. [I love you... ] [goes something like that] [Can't really remember. ] [Don't know the next bit. ] I know one which says: [It's so beautiful,] [my flag my flag... ] That one! [Nothing looks so fine. ] [Brave men seek its shade] [when they are about to die. ] [Brave men seek its shade] [when they are about to die. ] [No greater fortune could I wish] [for no greater fortune,] [no greater honor claim,] [no greater honor] [than to die for my flag,] [the white and blue flag. ] [Than to die for my flag,] [the white and blue flag. ] Jeez, you sing awful! Can't see why you bother if there's no one there to listen. For the cows, then. We're like students, going out for a sing-song. Get that student! Students sing in the streets for other people to hear. You can sing for yourself too, just for the fun of it. Some people talk to themselves, some people sing to themselves. And who do you think you are? What are you doing here? Who invited you? If I have to get off, I will, but they invited me. Might have guessed. Do me a favor, get off! So long, you guys! - Hey, Rodriguez! - What's up? Can you tell me who that guy is and who brought him along? - They brought him. I came with you. - They did? Who?s truck is it, anyway? I did the inviting, didn't I? Quite right to make him get off, Rodriguez. Who does he think he is, coming along with us? One thing to bring this bunch and quite another to bring a total stranger along. Who knows what he's after, that guy. Where he comes from. Cut it out... Cut the crap, will you, Vasco? Come on up. Good to have you back again. Up you get. That's it. Thanks, Rodriguez. Hey, you guys, a traveller! Hey there, hey! Get up on the truck and we'll give you a lift, you'll get frazzled in this heat. Come on, we'll take you a mile or two, at least! Go on, hurry up! We're off! Come on. Grab my hand. Motor's over-heating. - What d? ya expect with this old crate? - Does its best. - Cut it out with the truck! - What's bothering you? God's teeth! Everybody down. Truck's had it. Start pushing! What about you? - What about me? - Lost a leg, have you? Go on, get off. - What, to push? - No, to stand and watch! Go on, man, give 'em a hand. Go on, put your back into it! Hey! What if go home? I've had enough of pushing this crate all the way to the beach it's a lousy idea. Go on, Quintana, give it a push. Go on! Go on, Vasco, push! Only a bit more uphill. Don't grumble, Quintana, it'll start on the way down. Come on, Quintana. Sunday today and you got no funerals. Go on! Let's have less talk and more push, come on. Have to take care of everything, do I? - Give us that, I want some! - Give it to me! - I don't want any. - Take a bit, it'll do you good. Look at that. Seven! Look! Look at that. Nice lady for a rainy afternoon, eh? And for a dry one, too. With a dame like that, I'd walk her round town without even giving these guys the time of day. [And when your wife sees you] she beats the shit out of you. - Expensive, those dames. - All women are. Not for ranch-hands, those dames. Can you imagine her, getting up at 5 in the morning, picking sweet potatoes, milking the cows and eating mutton? No! That woman ain't real. She's made for the billboard. No women have hair like that, teeth like that. Where you seen a woman with perfume like that? - What perfume? - Not me, no... Use your imagination. You stare at her, you concentrate, you take a sniff and you smell it. Take a sniff! Take a sniff! Give us a break, you're making me... Can you stop messing about with that road sign? Either we get this truck going or we're here for good. What am I doing here? We're out of water. Go and fetch the water bottle. The demijohn with the water for the radiator. It's empty. What a load of perverts! Drinking the radiator water. I should kick you all off for being so dumb! Okay, now you've gotta go and fetch some more. Okay, you guys. You gotta go and fetch more water for the radiator. - Listen to the foreman! - Yeah, the ones up front think they're the bosses. Down in that hollow over there, there's bound to be some water although it ain't easy with the bottle... - Vasco! - What? Here, take this. Get him moving. Everybody off. Stop that! Stop it! Stop man! Stop! It'll fall to pieces! What if it's cold. Why don't you go screw yourself? Have you ever seen such a foul-mouthed guy! Want me to have a try? Start it up, please. Lock it up and let's go, Vasco. Hey, Chief! Know anywhere hereabouts we can get some water? Vasco, hand me the bottle! - Hand me the bottle, Rataplan! - Which one? Which d? ya think? The one you drank from. - What d? ya want it for? - Do me a favor, give to me! No, I won't. - Gimme! - No I won't... Watch what you're doing. - Are you hurt? Are you? - No, I'm okay. - He's still alive! - Are you sure? Feel dizzy, do you? Dizzy from all that cane liquor, more like. Do me a favor, you're like kids! Holy smoke! What a pain in the ass he is! 'Morning. Any water round here, is there? Over there. Didn't see any. Down there in that hollow First you hear it, then you see it. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks. Ready? Let's get going. What are you doing here? - We're leaving. - Leave him alone. He's hurt. You, Galan, come here. How? ya feeling? - A bit dizzy but better, I think. - Hop up, then. Let's go. - Here he comes. Don't let him on. - Don't let him on. Stay there, you snitch! Get lost, snitch! Take this, Quintana Thanks, Seven. And don't you ever touch my hat again. Next time, I'll kill you. Hey, this is my seat. Hey! I felt a drop of rain. I told Rodriguez, this trip wasn't worth doing. You can take a little nap, if you feel like it. No, leave it. We can't be far from the sea, can we? Not far, no. Though if this bad luck keeps up... who knows?

I bet you the barbecue that just round that bend there, we'll see the sea. Oh, cut it out with that, will you and we'll leave it for later, shall we? All this going uphill and downhill, uphill and downhill, it's made me dizzier than the booze this morning. You're right there. If it wasn't for all these uphills and downhills, I bet we'd have got to the sea by now That's what I say. these uphills and downhills, that's what kills ya. Got a family, have you? Tell me something. What's your game, exactly? Pardon my curiosity. People need to be curious if they're to increase their knowledge. Sure. We always need to know more to understand things better, and that's fine. Listen here, everyone's his own boss, and I respect that, but... just so happens I'm riding beside a guy - I don't know fromAdam. - Me too. I mean, me neither. How did I get into this? Well, I asked for it! And what do you do for a living, if it's not a secret? The truth? Yeah, yeah! - I'm a writer. - Fucking hell! - Writing something now, are you? - A short story. And what's the name of this story? "Seawards Journey". It's about a group of friends who travel by truck to the seaside, And on their way they meet a fugitive bank robber from the capital. And the guy asks them to give him a lift. - And they do. - Sure they do. They come to a police road-block, there's a shoot out, various dead bodies. Then the robber escapes with the truck, and when he gets to the coast, a woman's waiting in a motor boat. And they go off with the truck? They go off in the truck, yes. Then it turns out... the woman was cheating on him with a local boss man and the guy wants revenge. And how does it end? I don't know yet. I've got a bit more to do. Have we got much more to do? A bit more. Look, look, there's the sea! Look right ahead! That's the sea! Can't see a thing. - Hey, man. - What? What are all those folks doing there half-naked? - What are they doing? - They're taking a break. What from? They work all year, then come to the seaside for a summer break. Look at that one over there, look what she's wearing... Have to be pretty easy-going to go about like that. Nothing like that in our town. No, Sir. Well, Gladys maybe. But she ain't never gone outside like that. Take a look at that, Seven. - They smoke blond tobacco here, look! - That's what I mean. Well! We have been through a lot to get here, but now you'll see what the sea's really like. This is the life! Isn't it swell? Swell? Swell? We had a lousy trip and on top of that, we didn't see a thing! No, no. Trips begin after you've got back. Take it from me... I went to the capital, once wasn't till I got back home and told my buddies, that I realized just what a great trip it had been. - If you say so. - That's the way it is. Aquino, come here! Good dog! Don't drink that water! It's salty water, Aquino! God, this is great! Really great! Isn't it great? Okay, come on then. Now we're going to take a look at the sea. Wait, Rodriguez! We got soaking wet, and now we're starving, let's have the barbecue first. That's it. We have a nice peaceful barbecue, and then we go and take a look at the sea. The sea'll still be there. It's not going away. It's not going away? But the day is! Did we come to see the sea, or did we not? If you see the sea... when you're dead hungry, it's no fun at all, hang on a bit, Chief. - Who's idea was it to do the barbecue? - Yours, Rodriguez! You do it, Vasco. Hey, you guys, what's that Rodriguez up to? Just staring at the sea. What for? Only need to look once. Listen to you, Quintana, you asshole, how would you know, if you never even seen it? Just might be worth taking more than one look! Hey, Vasco, your barbecue was real tasty, brother. Yeah? - Let's have a hand for the cook! - Right! And I didn't even have dry firewood. Hey, fellas. Don't throw the bones on the fire I need 'em forAquino. Perfect for a little nap now, ain't it? Nothing like a nap to help the digestion. Not for me, not without my mattress. - Can't do without it. - Me either. Me either. Know something, you might not believe it, but I'm a one woman-one-mattress guy, I am. Real gaucho men, can sleep in a cot or up against their saddles. - Some fellas can sleep anywhere. - That's for sure. Fine bunch of gauchos, you are, you fellas! Give me a good mattress and you can keep the rest. - No kidding, you smart alec. - Sleep on the grass here today, then tomorrow, on your own mattress, see if you don't enjoy it more! And what about the old lady? - Which old lady? - Any of them. If there's a mattress, there's gotta be a woman! You got one? - A mattress? - A woman. Vasco, that's not a question to ask. Looks like a man who's been around a bit and he's probably got a whole bunch of 'em. Tell us about it. Can't complain. But it's not something to brag about, eh? No, better not to brag, truth will out, sooner or later. Well said, fella! Bring you all the way to the sea and you just sleep under the trees. There are trees everywhere, but the sea, that's something else, fantastic, I call it. That amazing, is it, Rodriguez? Mysterious, it is, I can't explain it. Come on, you fellas! Come on, come on! We're coming. Well, Seven-plus-three, What do you reckon? What can I say? Lots and lots of water, piles and piles of it. Like land it is, only water. That's the way it is. Lots of water! What can I say, Rodriguez? Can't say it's land if it's water, can I? What do you reckon? - Reckon, what? - Reckon, what? What d'ya think? The sea. The sea... The best thing about it is the sand. The only thing you like is the sand? Funny, ain't it? Doesn't look like sand. But.. it is. Well, it was tough going but we made it. I knew we'd make it. 'Course we would. And was it worth it? - Sure was. - Yeah? So, is this how you imagined it? How could I imagine this? All this water! What I don't get is where it all comes from, there's no bank. 'Course there ain't. Sure, you can see the currents in rivers and streams, but not in the sea. Kinda slow moving, it is. Slowing moving? No way. Like a huge lake, a lagoon. Yeah, Quintana. Like a lagoon. When the ducks come flying in, it'll be nice to take a few shots. Right, Rataplan. Is this how you imagined it? Sure wasn't. How could I imagine this? Is it big or what? Big, yeah, it sure is. But... got no ships. If you ask me, a sea without ships is like field without trees. See, you paint the countryside, and if you don't put trees in, it ain't no good. Same thing for the sea, I reckon. Sure. But the ships are out there. They are. Sailing through the channel, a few miles out. There's probably one passing right now. No. No. Can't see it, no you can't. Sure you can't see it. 'Cos the earth is round. How about the water? That round too? Holy smoke! May God punish me if I ever bring a bunch of animals like this lot to see the sea! Can't help being a bit homesick.
