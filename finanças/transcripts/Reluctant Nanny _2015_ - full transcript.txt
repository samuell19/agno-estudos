[Indistinct chatter] I'll just call you as soon as we land. Taxi. You ever tried cake pops? It's cake on a stick. Oh, I understand the concept. Yeah, I was thinking of serving those at my wedding instead of a traditional cake. Don't you have bridesmaids you can ask this stuff to? (Dispatcher) All units, attempt to locate two children missing from their foster home. First juvenile is Sam Anderson, ten-year-old male, brown hair. Second juvenile is Hannah Anderson, seven-year-old female, blond hair. I bet they're at the park. We ll see. (Dan) Hold on, you two. Hey, kids. It's a nice day to be outside. You guys here with a grown-up? We're waiting for our mother. Well, I guess Officer Moore and I will keep you company until she gets back. That's okay. She just went to get us a pretzel. You wouldn't happen to be Sam and Hannah Anderson? How do you know our names? Are we in trouble? Tom? And you are? Libby Prescott, the new VP of Biz Dev. Right. I totally forgot to call you. We have no more biz for you to dev. What does that mean? Yesterday I sold the company to Yabble Corp. They're absorbing us, so everyone's been let go. You're kidding me. I just let go of my place in Boston for this job. As of today. Are we allowed to keep the corporate housing? Sorry, no. There she is. Hi, Dan, Andrea. Where are the kids? (Dan) They're in the car. But we have a problem. They don't want to go back to their foster home. Well, actually, Mrs. Burke doesn't want them back. She thinks that they're too rowdy. And she suddenly has a heart condition. Yeah, apparently, she's missing one. So where are these kids supposed to go? They ve run away from three foster homes. I don't have that many options. Well, we can't keep them in the patrol car. I'm looking for an emergency placement for them for a day or two. - Then what? - New foster homes. Homes, Louisa? It's a really overcrowded system. I might have to separate them. No. These kids have been bouncing around foster care because I put their father in jail. [Phone beeps] I just got a placement for them. - Thanks for finding them. - Yeah. Sam, Hannah, let's go. (Louisa) All right, see you guys later. (Sam) Bye, guys. [Phone ringing] Hello. - Mom? - Hey. How was your first day? Or should I say [speaking French] One good thing about going back to school is, I'm taking French. Yeah. Well, what's French for it was also my last day? You quit already? The company got sold. Everybody was laid off. So what now? I've got enough cash for a few days. I'll stay in a motel. Now I'm worried. Don't be. I'll call you soon. Okay. (Louisa) Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, I understand. Perfect. Okay, I'll talk to you then. Bye-bye. They really never let you have a lunch break, do they? Not with my caseload. Well, sorry to add to it. I just wanted to swing by and see how Sam and Hannah were doing. They're still in the emergency placement. - Together? - For now. I think I found a foster home for Hannah. They can take her today. Okay. Well, what about Sam? Dan, I know you mean well, but don't you think I would keep them together if I could? Well, cops can take temporary custody of a child, right? - Yeah, or two. - So what would I need to do? Not a lot, actually, if they stayed with you for a week or two. Do you know what you're getting into? These kids have... they have some issues. Which would only get worse if they were separated, right? Okay, yeah. But before I do anything, you're gonna need to get yourself a nanny. I will get a nanny then. Enjoy your lunch break. (Scott) Job placement for tech executives is our specialty. Very impressive. I just wonder about this gap in your employment history. What were you doing for the past 18 months? I tried to launch my own start-up, making a game. I sunk all my savings into it, hence the whole needing a job thing right now. Okay. Well, what are you looking for? Actually, I am not that picky. So anything that starts tomorrow. Listen, it's tough out there right now. So patience is a virtue. Not one of mine. (Dan) I'm getting one decent resume from a live-in, and she can't start for a month. (Andrea) Oh? Well, you might have to fork out more money. (Dan) The good ones make more than we do. I don't know how it is to pick up the kids, cook, and keep the house clean. Oh, you clearly don't know any moms. I just hope I'm not making a mistake. Oh, come on. When you were with Lauren, the only thing you talked about was starting a family. Yeah, she went from not wanting kids right away to not wanting them ever. Don't look too much into this whole foster thing, all right? It's just for a couple of days, until Louisa can place them together. (Andrea) Right. Get back to me about that in a month. [Grunts] No. Seriously? Come on. Hey, that's my purse. Hey, stop! Someone get him! He has my purse! Slow down! Hey. Stop it. Stop. I flew across the country just to get let go on my first day. I am stranded in this city with no place to live, no friends and barely any cash, which you just took. Does that make you feel good about yourself? - No, not really. - Police. Freeze. You too, ma am. Keep your hands up. So who's mugging who here? I was just walking along, and this criminal grabbed my purse. Okay, keep them up for me. You got it, Andrea? Yup. You know the drill. (Andrea) You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You can put your hands down. Yeah. You okay? Fine. Thank you. What you did is very dangerous. - I know. - What if he had been armed? I had a rough day. This was the last straw. So let me see if I got this right. Perpetrator grabbed your bag. You pursued on foot, then got your property back? - Mm-hmm. - Just need an address and then we can make sure you get on your way. (Libby) Funny thing about that. I only have a Web address. I'm currently in between places until I find a new job, so... - Gotcha. - If you need me, I'll be up at the Midtown Inn for the next couple days. I'll get another unit out here to make sure you get back safe. Okay. Dispatch, this is 227. Can we get another unit out to Main Street? [Phone beeps] (Scott) Libby, Scott Mays here. I sent your resume out to a few places but no bites yet. But stay in town. Something might open up next week. Okay, bye. Mm-hmm. If I have enough money to last till next week. (Dan) Yes. I've tried every other agency. I need a nanny to start tomorrow. (Woman) I've told you, we just don't have anyone available. Okay, what about a manny? (Woman) Sir, have a good night. Hello? Libby. [Phone ringing] - Scott? - No. This is Officer Dan Connor, with your whole purse thing. Oh. Hey, what's up? Don't tell me that that mugger escaped. No. I was wondering, have you ever worked with kids? What does that have to do with my mugging? Absolutely nothing. Look, I have a proposition for you. I see that you've worked on lots of kids games. - I need a nanny. - Nanny? You would really be helping me out of a jam. I'm taking in some foster kids until they can find a home. Well, that's really sweet. But why me? You seem responsible. And your resume is very impressive. - How old are they? - Sam's ten, and Hannah's seven. Room and board is included. Kids? Yeah, sure. You know, we used to have kids come over and focus group our games all the time. So yes, I have watched kids before. There would also be some cooking and light housekeeping. Okay. I can do that. When do I start? [Doorbell rings] Okay. - Hey. - Hi. Come in, come in. No, allow me. I got it. Thank you. So this is the place. Thank you so much for taking the nanny job. The kids room is upstairs. It's the guest room. My room is also up there. This is the living room. The dining room over there. Here's the kitchen, as you can see. And this is where you ll be staying, my man cave. [Chuckles] Uh-huh. The couch folds out into a bed. So with the kids staying here, are you still able to have the guys over and watch sports and eat nachos? You ever tried to get nacho cheese out of the carpet? Mm. All right. Well, Sam and Hannah get here this afternoon, so I am gonna go on a grocery run. If you want to just get settled and wouldn't mind maybe tidying up just a little bit, - that would be... - Of course. Awesome. Thank you. [Phone ringing] - Hey. - Emergency. I can't access my art history lecture notes. It's not recognizing my password. I hope you changed it from password. Why would I? That's so easy to remember. I'll just send you the link. Anyway, I got a new job. It's only for a couple weeks. I'm a nanny. Is that some kind of new tech slang, like a guru? No, I'm watching two actual children, cooking, cleaning, taking them to school. Oh, no, honey. Mom, it's just for a couple weeks. I need the extra cash, and a headhunter told me to stay in town. Besides, I'll be working for a cop, which is much safer than that motel. But you don't know anything about children. How hard can it be? They're just like tiny people, - right? - Wrong. (Libby) Between you and the internet, I can handle any parenting problem. [Scoffs] [lively music] ♪ ♪ All right. [Doorbell rings] They're here. (Dan) Hey. Oh, great, you're here. You can bring it on in. Sure. Okay, thank you again so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, so what is all of this stuff? I'm so sorry. I should've told you. This was all supposed to go to my new apartment. Okay. It's just that the kids are on their way, and I have no idea where we're gonna put all this stuff. No, I get it. Don't worry, this can all go in my bedroom. I don't mind living with a little bit of clutter for a week or two. It's fine. Okay. [Doorbell rings] - (Louisa) Hi. - Hey. You guys remember Dan. Hi, guys. Come on in. It's good to see you again. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, kids. - Are you the nanny? - Hi, I'm Libby. (Louisa) Well, if you have any questions, call me. I'll be back in a week and see how you guys are doing. - I'll call you. - All right. Be good, you guys. - Bye, nice to meet you. - Bye. Bye, Louisa. So Libby is going to be your nanny for a few weeks. We are going to have so much fun. If we're still here. Louisa is going to find you a great home, one where you get to stay together. Until our daddy comes back for us. I am gonna show you guys to your room. Does that sound great? And then Libby is gonna cook us some dinner. - I hope you're hungry. - I can do that. Yeah. All right. Right up the stairs. You need any help? Okay, you got it. (Dan) It's right through here. This is it. You each have your own bed. Which one of you guys wants the one that's closest to the window? We don't care. Well, I got you guys backpacks for when you start school. There's binders and paper, some pencils in there. I'm not sure what else you guys will need, but we can get that. Hey. I know this can't be easy for you guys. But let's try to have fun, okay? (Dan) What do you guys like to do? After dinner, we could watch a movie. We could play a game, maybe catch. - What do you say? - Can we just go to our room? Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever you want. Let me get that. Let me. If you change your mind, let me know, okay? Knock, knock, you guys. (Dan) Well, it's 8:00. That means it's bedtime around here. We're not tired. Well, you have a very big day tomorrow. Can we watch TV? No. It's time to go to sleep. We don't want to. Just close your eyes and lie down. You ll fall asleep before your head hits the pillow. I know I will. Come on, Sam. All right. Is that thing off, mister? - Yeah. - Okay. There you go. Good night. Good night, Hannah. I sleep with the light on. Sorry. Now the monsters won't get you. There's monsters here? No because I am a police officer. So no monster would dare show its face around here. (Dan) Okay? Good night. Night. [Blender running] (Sam) What's in that? Spinach, avocado, and apple, a healthy breakfast for your first day of school. (Libby) I make them all the time. They really get you going in the morning. (Dan) Oh, come on, guys. I'm sure it tastes better than it looks. It ll make you want to go. [Chokes] Actually, I just remembered that Andrea is bringing muffins to work. You guys want some cereal? Let's hurry. We don't want to be late on our first day. (Libby) Your room is one forty... (Dan) Two. 142. (Libby) Okay. - Sam, you doing okay? - Yeah. - Here we are. - Okay. Kids, I have to run to the front office and fill out some paperwork. But you are gonna have a great first day, okay? And Libby is gonna pick you up this afternoon. Mm-hmm. There it is. It's gonna be great. All right? Come on, Sam, cheer up. You're gonna make new friends and learn really cool things. Okay, I used to be the new kid a lot too. It can be fun. You know, you could always reinvent yourself. Once, I pretended that I had just moved back from London and put on a British accent. I wouldn't recommend that, though. All right, go. Okay. Okay. I think it's up there. Second grade. Whoo-whoo. I'll go in with you, yeah? [Phone ringing] - Hi, honey. - So how's school going? Well, this girl asked me to join her study group. You definitely should. Libby, she was younger than you. I told her I'm not the study group kind of gal. Speaking of kids, how are yours? Confusing. What do I do with them after school? You could help them with their homework, you know, unless Dan wants to do that. How's it going with him? He's good. He's trying to be strict, but he's sweet. You can tell that he cares about the kids. Anyway, I've got to get to the dry cleaner. The little girl got crayon stains all over my blouse. You're in way over your head, aren't you? I'll figure it out. They are, like, a million parenting blogs. But, Mom, I got to go. Bye. - Okay. - Hey. So no emergency phone calls from the school, so I assume that they are both still in class. - Well, that's good. - Sam didn't seem thrilled. I felt like we were dropping a rabbit - off at a coyote convention. - Can't blame him. As soon as Louisa finds them a new foster home, they ll have to switch schools all over again. Yeah, my dad was in the military, so I was always switching schools too. It is not easy to consistently be starting over. I can imagine. Maybe you could talk to Sam about that. Oh, I tried. He has no desire to hear what I want to say. I'm sure they're warming up to you. Don't forget, I'm working late tonight. Be careful. Thank you. You too. You're gonna have to put them to bed by yourself. Can you maybe leave me your handcuffs? Bye. Bye. All right, bedtime. We're not tired. Well, every time you go to sleep on time, you get a gold star. Okay. What ll it take to get the two of you to go to sleep? We like chocolate milk before bed. We made you some too. Did you put something weird in mine? No. Okay. Deal. [Both laughing] (Scott) Hi, you've reached Scott. Please leave a message. Scott, hi. It's Libby Prescott. I'm just calling to see if there was any news on the job front. I am open to anything. Anything. Okay, call me back. My shoes. I was playing dress-up outside, and I got mud on them. I wanted to clean them up, so you wouldn't get mad. We ll replace them. I can't even replace these. These were $300. Holy moly. Do they have diamonds on them? Rocket boosters? No. You're sad about your shoes. I'm really sorry. So is Sam. Don't worry about it. It's just... I've... I've never been bad at my job before. What was your job? Before this, I used to make video games. I love video games. Now, if I win, you and Hannah go to bed. And if I win, we get to watch TV as long as we want. Okay. You're so not gonna win. Oh, I'm totally gonna beat you. - Mm-hmm. Ready? - Yeah. Okay. - Okay. - Hurry. (Hannah) Come on, get ready for the turn. - Around the corner. - Come on, Sam, get her. - It's right up there. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Come on. (Sam) Oh, no, no, no, no. No. - Yes. - Argh! - I won. - How are you so good at this? This was the first game I ever worked on. What other games have you done? I have done a lot. Um. You know, there was one that I created, but it never made it out there into the world. So that's why I had to get a regular-person job, because being an adult is expensive. You should've bought cheaper shoes. You're probably right. All right, bedtime. All right. Good night. Good night. Libby. Sorry. Hey. Where are the kids? Asleep. And the mess? Dinner was eaten and all cleaned up. Huh. And as a reward, I'm going to go get a great night of beauty sleep. Good night. And thank you. (Libby) You're welcome. We shouldn't be mean to Libby. She wants to be our friend. She's not our friend. As soon as we go to the next foster house, we ll never see her or Dan again. (Woman) Slow down. - Come on. - Hurry. (David) Over here. It's Sam, right? The new kid. - Yeah. - I'm David. I live across the street from you. You have a good arm. Thanks. My dad coaches little league. They're having tryouts next week. I bet you d make the team. No, thanks. - Oh, there you are. - Oh, hey. - I got your message. - You know, I thought that I d found a home for Sam and Hannah, but it fell through. I'm so sorry. - Louisa. - So I guess I should get that license, right? How do I get that going? Well, we can start the paperwork. I can pop by for an inspection and... but hopefully, I'm gonna find something before that. Okay. All right. No, um, - I'll sit. - Great. Okay. - How do you like the sandwich? - It's okay. Maybe it could use a little ketchup. [Laughing] Oh. - Hey. - What? What's going on here? The new kid's a messy eater. Cameron squirted the ketchup, so it would go all over Sam. (Woman) Cameron, Everett, Jackson, you're all in detention this afternoon. Come with me, now. But we didn't do anything. (Boy) I don't believe this. This isn t the last you've heard of me. You got it? What did you bring a teacher for? I could've handled it by myself. But now if Cameron bothers you again, he ll really be in trouble. And now I look like a loser and a tattletale. I was just trying to help. I don't need your help. Sheesh. Hey. Oh, Sam, what happened to your shirt? Nothing. - Hey. - Hi. Where are Sam and Hannah? Asleep. Or pretending to be. Sandwiches? Turkey. They do okay at school today? Yeah. Hannah's having fun. I'm a little worried about Sam, though. I've been the new kid a bunch, and it's not always easy. Where did you grow up? Japan, Texas, San Diego. You d get used to a place, and then it d be time to leave. That must ve been tough. Especially when your parents don't get along. Did they stay together? Till about three years ago. My mom stayed for my sister and I. Are you close with your family? I talk to my mom all the time, my sister sometimes, my Dad is stationed somewhere. He usually pops up around holidays and birthdays. With all your jobs and all your moving around, you're kind of like your dad. Not really. What about you? Enough about me. Perfect family, right? My parents have been happily married for over 35 years. I have six brothers and sisters. We're all kind of scattered about the country. - Wow. - We're very close, though I don't see them all that often anymore. They all have little kids. I guess I'm the only one whose life didn't work out that way. That's a lot of perfect to measure up to. School lunch achievement unlocked. I'm impressed. Oh. I made these for you for work tomorrow. (Libby) These cookies are sugar-free and gluten-free. (Mom) Why did you ever decide to go to grad school? You took all those extra midterms by choice. Don't panic. Drink coffee. I don't know if there s enough coffee in the world to make calculus interesting. How... how are you? Okay. Hey, do you think I'm like Dad? Well, you do move around for work. Why do you ask? No reason. Oh, how do I make cookies less crunchy? - Follow the recipe. - So maybe I might, like, microwave so evenly and efficiently. Okay, I really got to go. Libby, I just got off the phone with Louisa. She's on her way over to inspect the house. We only have an hour. If we don't pass the inspection, the kids can't stay here. Okay. We ll get it done. Hey, calm down. Louisa's your friend, right? She is, which is why I'm so nervous. She always does everything by the book. (Libby) Everything has been fine. The only teeny, little thing is that Hannah's not sleeping so well. We need to figure out how to get to sleep with the lights out. It's like... Like she has stock in the electric company? I have never heard that before. My mom used to say it when I would sleep with the lights on. Were you afraid of monsters like Hannah? No. When the lights were on, they thought that we were awake. And they only ever really fought when they knew we were asleep. If you need to leave the light on here, that's okay with me. I don't think I do. What are you doing? I heard Dan say the social worker is coming to check on us. - Everything has to be perfect. - Why? (Hannah) So we can stay with Dan and Libby. It's nice here. [Doorbell rings] Everybody ready? Smile. - All right. - Smile. Hi, Louisa. Thank you for fitting us in. No problem. How are you? - I'm good. - Hi. Hi. - Good to see you again. - How you guys doing? They are enrolled in school, and Libby has been helping them with their homework. Mm-hmm. They ve also got their own room, which I can show you. - We can start there. Perfect. - Okay, let's go up there. Hey, you. (Libby) Let's show her your room. - Here it is. - Wow. Nice, Dan. Thank you. It's great. Well, I'm sure there's no hazardous materials in the kitchen. Only my cooking. [Both chuckle] Kidding. And on nights when I don't have to work too late, we like to try and sit down to dinner together as a family. Sam? Did you do this? No. I had a little accident while making breakfast. This is completely my fault. I just didn't have any time to clean it up. I'm done here. - I'll walk you out. - Bye, Libby. Bye. Bye, guys. Why didn't you tell Dan on me? You want to tell me why you did it? That's the problem. I like it here. Dan's strict, but he's kind. And you're... getting better. Oh, thank you. Louisa is gonna take us away. Better that she does it before Hannah starts to like it here too much. I told you that when I was younger, I moved around a lot, right? I d start to make friends, and then I d never see them again. That's why it's better to be alone. No. You miss out on some special people if you never let anybody in. Even if they're only there for a little bit? Yes. Because if you never give anyone a chance, being alone starts to feel normal. And it shouldn't. Maybe I can be friends with David. Now go on in the kitchen and start cleaning up. There might be some cookies involved in it for you. (Andrea) Hey, I need to call the stationery store back. My phone died. Can I use yours? Yeah, sure. Call away. Thank you. Libby and the kids as your screen saver. Someone's enjoying his new family. It's just a picture. So how is it coming along? Good. Messy. [Beeping] Oh, I've got my interview at 9:00. If I drop the kids off now, I can make it in time. Okay. Hey, before you go, I got something for Hannah. Oh, a night light. She's gonna love this. I got you one too. (Libby) Okay. Here we are. Let me help you. There you go. - Bye, Libby. - Bye. Have a good day. (Cameron) Yeah, I'm gonna skip third period. What's up, you little tattletale? No teachers are gonna help you now. Leave him alone. Sam, it's okay. It's not okay. And what are you gonna do about it, loser? Don't call me that. Why? You are like your father, aren't you? I mean, he is in jail, right? (Man) Thank you for coming in, Libby. We were all very impressed with your resume. Oh, thank you for having me. I have to apologize. I really haven t had much time to research your company. Oh, hang on. Crafts projects. I completely understand. My wife and I are usually covered in glitter or food at least once a day. So tell me a little bit about this position. It requires traveling about 40 % of the time. That might be difficult with kids. Oh, I don't have kids. I mean, I do right now, but they're not mine. I'm just... just helping a friend out right now. A few of your strong suits are research and number-crunching? [Phone ringing] I'm sorry. It's the school. I... excuse me. Libby Prescott. He what? Okay, I'll be right there. Thanks. One of the kids has an emergency. Oh, I thought they weren t your kids. They're not. But it's... it's complicated. I have to go. Oh, we're meeting with other candidates today. If you can't see the CTO this morning, the job goes to someone else. I understand. I'm sorry. Sorry. I got here as fast as I could. Dan. Principal Carter was just filling us in on Sam's incident. We have a zero-tolerance policy for fighting in this school. Sam has to be suspended. He punched a boy in the nose. I see. Can we please hear Sam's side of the story? Cameron was gonna hurt my friend David. You have a friend? He's really nice. (Libby) Sam was sticking up for his friend, who was obviously about to get pummeled by the actual bully. So if you really do have an anti-bullying policy here, don't you feel it would be better to focus less on the words and more about the actions? If you were to punish Sam and leave the real bully roaming the halls, torturing innocent children, what kind of message would that send? I suppose since Sam was defending David, we could let him off with a warning. And he has to apologize to Cameron. - But... but he... - Sam... you will apologize. All right. How did the interview go? - I left to come here. - Wait a second. You left the job interview to come talk to the principal? Can you go back? No, I lost that one. But it sounded boring anyway. Well, you were pretty impressive in there. Sam would've been suspended if it weren t for you. Well, I had a really big incentive. If Sam and I were to be left alone in the house together all day, we would drive each other insane. [Chuckles] Give me a break. You guys are best buds. Yeah. I wish I had that kind of relationship with the kids. You just need to figure out what you have in common. Sam and I play video games together. So you just need to find out what you both like. The kids are lucky they found you. Well, they're very lucky to have you too. You're not getting attached to us now, are you? You know, I got to go to the grocery store before it closes. You know, it's open 24 hours. - Good night. - Good night. So we will start with snacks, and then we will do your homework. Do you guys have a lot? I have a lot of math. (Dan) Hey, guys. How was everybody's day? Hannah got a 95 on her reading test. Did you? That's amazing. You want to read me a story? No. I have to make cupcakes for the bake sale tomorrow. - Bake sale? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a bake sale tomorrow? Yeah, for my class, so we can get art supplies. Why didn't you tell me? We need to make them today, and I don't have any of the ingredients. If you make them, they might not taste good. Probably. But there are no rules that we can't go to the store and buy some. Dan, can you watch Sam? Sure. All right, come on. So, Sam, you need any help with your homework? No. Libby will help me. So you've never held a bat before? All right. Well, Dan's gonna give you some pointers. First, you want to line up your knuckles like this. That way, when you swing, you ll roll right through that strike zone, okay? I want you to take this. Also, you want to use your hips, okay? So when you swing, you ll twist, because your power actually comes from your lower body, not really too much from your arms. Sounds good? You ready to try one? - Yeah. - You got this. Batter up. Why don't you grab up a little higher on the bat. We call that choking up. Perfect. And we ll get you one that's the right size, okay? Not too tight. Use the hips. Here it comes. - I stink. - No, no, no, no. Hey, nobody ever hits on their first try. You got to practice. How many days till your tryouts? (Sam) Two days. That is plenty of time. We ll work together. You ll be hitting homers by then. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Hannah and I are making cupcakes from scratch. We could use some helpers. I want frosting. (Libby) Dan? Oh, yeah. I could be enticed into helping out. Let me get the door. Thank you. (Libby) Okay. [Beeping] [gasps] All right, the first batch is ready. That doesn't look like the picture. Oh, but, honey, we haven t decorated them yet. - Second batch? - Second batch. [Doorbell rings] - Sam, will you grab the door? - Yeah. Thanks, bud. Oh, honey, you are way too young to be frosting your hair. And you are also too young to understand that joke. That was a nice try, though. Hey, do you want to practice for tryouts? Let me ask Dan. - Hi, Mr. Connor. - Oh, hey, David. - Hi. - Hey. Dan, can we go and practice on the lawn? Yeah, of course. - Get out there. - Cool. Hey, Hannah, why don't you go out there and show those guys a thing or two about baseball, huh? There's extra mitts in the closet. I should've stuck with the store-bought cupcakes. [Both chuckle] Why is that so funny? I mean, it is funny. But you are also hard to take seriously... [chuckles] with frosting on your nose. [Phone ringing] No, let the machine get it. Okay. (Evelyn) Hello, this is Evelyn. My job ended, and are you still looking for a nanny? I can start on Monday. I look forward to hearing from you. Bye. I should probably call her back. Yeah. And tell her... It's a good thing. I could have a new job by next week, so you should definitely call her and tell her to start on Monday. Of course. Mm-hmm All right, just remember, it's a posted 35 through here. There you go. Drive safe. So why did you hire a new nanny if you like Libby? It was her decision. Well, just because she's not living in your house doesn't mean you can't see her. Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake that I do have feelings for Libby. How do I know if she feels the same way? It's called a date. A man asks a woman out, and they get to know each other while eating food. Wear something nice, ask her about herself, and pick up the check. It's pretty easy. [Phone ringing] - Hold up. - Hey, Dan, - I've got good news. - I could use some. - Your foster license is ready. - Oh, that's great news. And also, I found a permanent home, I think, for Sam and Hannah. Is it good for them to move again so soon? Oh, why? Are you considering keeping them longer? I don't know. Dan, you've done a really good thing, keeping these kids. It's okay to let them go. I mean, think about it and get back to me. - Yeah. - Okay, bye. (Dispatcher) 1912 Lake. 11-99, code 33. Hannah, what did I tell you about eating the inventory? Nobody wants them. I don't know why. They're yummy. That's not bad. How cute. You let Hannah make all the cupcakes by herself? No, Libby made them. Grandma's recipe. I guess Grandma really liked the color beige. Hannah, why don't you go join your friends. (Woman) Robin, you got a minute? Oh, yeah. These bake sales are quite the production, huh? What are you doing here? And I'm not going to make a cop-and-doughnut joke. Thank you. I just wanted to see how our cupcakes were selling. Well, we ve got a few on hold. I d buy one. Evelyn is all ready to start on Monday. Do you have somewhere to go? Yeah, I'll just put my stuff in storage and go back to that motel. I'll be fine there. I was wondering if I could... if we could go out to dinner. Aww. Yeah. I'll find a place with a good kids menu. I was thinking just us. I would ask Evelyn to watch the kids. You know, that way she gets a chance to know them before she moves in. Of course. Yeah, of course. I guess I'll pick you up. I will meet you on the front porch. Don't tell the cops. (Dan) Our new nanny is going to be Evelyn. - What? Why? - I don't want a new nanny. I know. I don't like it either. But, look, Libby has a different career. She makes games. It's not fair of us to keep her. Guys, she's not moving very far. Okay? And we will still see her. We can probably even have her over. We could do a family dinner on Sundays. That would be good, right? Are you guys okay? I guess. I need you both to be on your best behavior. Promise? I promise. I promise too. Thank you. [Doorbell rings] That is probably her. - You must be Evelyn. - Yes, I am. Please, come in. And this must be Sam and Hannah. - Yeah. - So adorable. They are. Libby, you look so pretty. Evelyn, it's great to meet you. We must chat when I get back. Yes. But now go out and have a nice time. We will. Oh, Hannah likes to read before she goes to sleep. And Sam will request the wool blanket, but it makes him itchy, so I wouldn't give that to him. - I think she ll be fine. - Right. Our numbers are on the fridge, the closest hospital. If anything goes wrong, just give us a call. Will do. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. You two be good. - Bye, you guys. - Bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Libby lets us watch TV before homework. And she always lets us have juice before bedtime. Well, things are gonna change around here. So why did you become a cop? To get the bad guys off of the streets. I think it's because you want to help people, like how you tried to save me from that mugger. You were hardly the damsel in distress. Seriously, if I remember, I'm pretty sure I saved that guy from you. (Libby) Probably. No, my dad was a cop. And I don't know, something would just happen when he put on that uniform. Everyone in the whole neighborhood just felt safer when he was around. So that's why I do it. I want people to feel safe. Like Sam and Hannah, who I think... I think we are finally starting to bond, which is nice. You have been so great with them. I mean, I know this might be a crazy idea, but... why don't you just keep them? I guess I am just worried that... I don't think I could raise kids on my own. Of course you can. You risk your life every single day on the job. Anything after that should be easy. (Sam) We need to get rid of Evelyn. If we do anything bad, Dan will get mad at us. Libby's leaving. You want her to stay, right? Yeah. Then just do what I say. (Dan) Yeah, that's pretty much it. (Libby) This will be fun. (Dan) I mean, I think it ll be fun. (Libby) I like music. (Dan) Who doesn't? So there's this new jazz club that's opening up across town. I was thinking that maybe we could check that out next weekend, if you're not too busy. Those children are monsters. I quit. Evelyn. So... I will stay, till I get another job. - Understood. - Now, I think we have some lecturing to do. (Andrea) How did your date go? Does she love you or love you not? We had a nice dinner. And the kids made the new nanny quit, so Libby's staying. Ah, loves you. I thought we had a great time. We really connected. Just anytime it starts to get serious, she cracks a joke. So I don't know. - Hmm. - Loves me not. Well, it certainly sounds like you're into her. I'm crazy, right? Nope. This is the most sane I've seen you. (Dan) Watch him. See? See? Good contact. All right, you're up. Now, just remember everything we worked on, okay? You got it. Get out there. (Libby) All right, Sam. Come on. - Come on, bud. You got it. - Come on, Sam. All right, Sam. Come on, bud. You got this. Oh, Sam looks so nervous. Did he practice? A few times, with Dan. I took Cody to the batting cages every afternoon. That's him right there, in the yellow. Babe, you look good. All right, Sam. You got this. You know, the team does need water boys. Sam, you keep your eye on that ball. You got this. [All cheering] Yes. Oh, superstar. Come here. - Nice. - So good. Sam, my dad said that you made the team. Sweet. - That is amazing news. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - So good. You were a rock star out there. You were practicing without me. I saw that. You just... Hey, Libby. (Libby) Hmm? What's this? Oh, that was that game that I created. Is it hard to make a game? It's hard to make a successful one. But even kids your age can make one. It's 8:00, bedtime. But Libby was just about to show us how to make a game. Oh, well, then this I have to see. Okay. Um... So if you could be anything in the world, what would it be? A dragon. A dragon, okay. Hannah, this dragon is searching for something. What would it be searching for? Maybe gold? Flip-flops. Flip-flops, okay. So in your game, the dragon is on a quest to find flip-flops. But he must avoid the dangerous... Hamburgers. Hamburgers? Okay then. There's your game. So is that what your game was like? No. Mine was an educational game. It was about penguins teaching you how to do math. Did they slide down big ice slides and splash - under the water? - No. If your penguins did stuff like that, your game wouldn't be such a... - yawn. - Oh. Well, then. It's a great thing that I quit making kids games. I was really bad at baseball. But I didn't quit. I kept practicing with Dan, and now I'm a lot better. Yes, you are. And I hate to interrupt all of this creativity, but even game developers need their sleep. Well, we don't, actually. But kid game developers do. Bedtime. [Phone ringing] Hang on. Hey, Louisa. What's up? Hey, Dan. I've got bad news. The home that I wanted for the two kids filled those slots. I don't know what to do with them. I do. (Dan) It's still gonna be a while yet until your dad can come get you. So I thought, if it's okay with you, that maybe I could be your official foster dad. And we wouldn't have to move again? You could stay right here, with your new friend David and your little league team. We get to stay with you and Libby. That sound okay? Yeah. Good. But it is still your bedtime. So lights out. Just in case. But I think if the monsters were gonna come out, they would've by now. Good night. Hey, what are you doing up? You have school tomorrow. Dan's gonna be our real foster dad. Sam, that's great. I guess. I belong with my dad. He said to wait for him. He's gonna get out and take us horseback riding at the Brand Canyon. It's a stable not too far from here. That sounds like a lot of fun. You do know that it might be a while till that happens, right? I know. But Dan's not my real dad. He could give us away like the other foster parents did. Sometimes your real family can disappoint you too. I know. But you still love them. Right? (Dan) Hey. Sam told me you're keeping him and Hannah. It looks like our chat had quite the effect on you. Did it have any effect on you? You know, I should go make their lunches for tomorrow. Empty paper bags are no good for anything but hiccups. Yeah. (Woman) Anthony, good job. We have a game next Sunday, so maybe Libby can make those cupcakes. Libby's gonna be gone. She has a big job interview today. And she's gonna get it cause she's super smart. Dan was really sad today. I think he like-likes her. After my parents got divorced, my dad like-liked our neighbor. She was divorced too. She was going to move away, so he married her. Now she's my step-mom, and she's super nice. We have to get Dan to marry Libby. - How? - My dad made Daphne a romantic dinner, then gave her a ring in a box. He was her finance for a while, then they got married. I think you mean fiance. Yeah. [Both chuckling] - You guys ready to go? - Yeah. - You get all your gear? - Yeah. Bye, Sam. See you at school. - See you, David. - Thanks, man. See you. (Man) Well, you're certainly qualified. Oh, my daughter's school had a water main break, and my wife s on a business trip. We can reschedule. Oh, no. I'm fine with kids. I want to call Mom. As soon as I'm done talking to Libby, Gemma. Now just be quiet or you ll get a time out. So tell me a little bit more about this position. My headhunter really wasn t that specific. We're a virtual currency platform that lets games monetize microtransactions. - Mm-hmm. - So basically, you d be giving presentations to potential clients, you know, competitive landscape analysis and research, some project management too. Love it. Honey, put down Daddy's starfish. Thank you. Sorry. Hold on. It's Gemma? Yeah. Hey, Gemma. Come here. I had made this app for my friend Sam. But you can be the first to play it. - Do you like dragons? - Yeah. Yeah? Okay. So you need to see how many flip-flops the dragon can find without getting hit by any hamburgers. Cool. Cool. - That's a game? - Mm-hmm. Wow. You know, we ve had some pretty impressive candidates here today, but your resume stacks up. And if Gemma likes you, I'm sure you can handle our toughest clients. So if you want the job, it's yours. I'm in. Great. Oh, just one more thing. What's going on? We wanted to make you food that grown-ups like, so we asked Dan for your favorite: sushi. Oh. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, thank you. The kids have cooked up some kind of scheme. Let's just play along. Mm. You got the sushi? What's this? Sushi is fish and rice that's not cooked. Actually, the fish is raw, and the rice is cooked. No way. That's gross. We forgot something. Thank you. They actually want us to have a double wedding with Andrea and Luke this summer. - Oh. - But don't worry. I told them that we d go camping instead. Including me? I should've known that camping wasn t your thing. No, it's just... I'm not gonna be their nanny this summer. I know. But I think they have the right idea about us dating. There's something between us. And you are smart. And you are beautiful. And the kids love you. And I am complete... Dan, I took that job today. Okay. I mean, that's good. The job is in Portland. I'm moving next week. [Chuckles] I'm sorry. Everyone's so quiet. Are you all shocked that I made something edible for breakfast? Dan told us you're moving away. Yes, next week. Are you still gonna come to my little league games? And help me with my art projects? We can video chat, and we can email. I knew you weren t our friend. They knew this was going to happen. I should... I should move out tomorrow. (Dan) They just want the best for you. (Hannah) Libby. (Libby) Oh, honey. I'll take it. (Man) Everyone, this is Libby Prescott. She's gonna be heading up business development in our Portland office starting next week. Before she heads up, I thought she might be able to help with our little brainstorming session. I'm very excited to be on board. Now, going into the next quarter, we're looking to expand our business beyond virtual currency. Got any thoughts? Remember, there are no bad ideas. Libby. Since we're already in the gaming space with our virtual currency, why don't we develop a game? What kind of game? Children's educational games are really big right now, especially for mobile. We're not looking to take the company in that direction. You said no idea was a bad idea. Except that one. Lamont, what you got? (Lamont) Yeah, you can take a look at my proposal right here. Hey, you want to catch some speeders? Give some tickets? If you want to. What's up with you? You're awfully quiet. I'm just tired. You're upset because Libby's leaving, huh? She's already gone, left yesterday. And you're just telling me now? You got a lot on your plate with the wedding. I didn't want to bother you. Luke and I have decided that we're gonna elope. - Am I still invited? - Yep. And you still have to get me a present. So what's up with you and Libby? Well, it doesn't matter now. She's gone. Well, only if you give up. Wasn t that nice of David s parents to watch you guys today? The agency is sending over someone tomorrow. I don't want a new nanny. She ll pretend to like us and then leave. Our dad's the only one who really loves us. (Dan) Hey. That is not true. I love you. And Libby does too. She just... had to take a different job. She told me that I shouldn't be alone, that I need people. Yeah. But everybody leaves. No, Sam. [Doorbell rings] Libby's back. I will go check that. But you two, teeth, jammies, bed. And I will come up to tuck you in, okay? - Hey. - Oh, hey. It's a little late for a surprise inspection. There's something I need to talk to you about. Okay. Come on in. I'll get you a cup of coffee. Mom? Oh, you don't sound happy. You didn't get laid off again, did you? I hate my new job. So quit. You had your last job for one day. You know that that wasn t my choice. [Horn honking] Oh, sweetheart, I got to go. My study group's here. I thought that you blew them off. Yeah, well, I couldn't do this alone. Sometimes you can't be afraid to let people in. I got to go, baby. Mom? [Phone beeps] What's going on? I wanted you to be the first to know. Sam and Hannah's dad was released on parole today. Well, that's good news. (Louisa) The thing is, he terminated his parental rights. He doesn't want his own kids? Dad doesn't want us? Sam and Hannah are gonna go up for adoption. I wanted you to be the first to know. (Louisa) They're very happy here. You've made a really great home for them. The whole thing is just so strange. You know? I'm the one who put the father in jail, and I d be taking his kids. It's a really big responsibility. We lost Dad because of Dan. And now he doesn't want us either. He took us because he felt guilty. Let's go. Think you can handle it? Of course I want them. Those are my kids. Can we go tell them? - Yeah, we can tell them. - Okay. Hey, you guys, I've got some news. Sam? Hannah? [Phone ringing] - Dan? - The kids are gone. - They ve run away. - What? (Dan) Have they contacted you? I had Andrea send the kids photos to all the units in the area. Louisa's calling their old foster homes. We're gonna find them. They're on foot. They couldn't have gone too far. They run fast, remember? Did you check the park? We ve got units checking everywhere. I feel like this is my fault. No, it's actually mine. They must ve overheard me talking with Louisa. Their dad is our on parole, but he doesn't want them anymore. No wonder they're so upset. They were convinced he was coming back for them. Yeah, I know. Sam showed me a picture of him and Hannah and their dad of... Wait, Dan. I know where they are. You really think they walked this whole way? They're here. (Hannah) Daddy. Be quiet. Someone will hear us. Dad will. (Dan) Hey, kids. It's Dan. (Libby) Hannah? It's Dan. We got to go. - Wait, Sam. - Ah! (Hannah) Are you okay? (Sam) Yeah. Go, go. Ah. Sam, are you okay? My ankle. We have to go back and get help. It's scary here. No. We have to wait for Dad. You were right. (Dan) Sam. Hannah. (Dan) We know you're here. Why did you guys run away? Because you're a liar. When did I lie to you, buddy? You pretended to care. And you took Dad away from us. And now you're giving us away, like everyone else. You didn't hear everything, Sam. I want to adopt you. I don't believe you. You're a liar, just like Libby. I'm not going anywhere. You can't tell them that if you don't mean it. I do. Dan. Sam, you're hurt. - Are you really back? - I am. Sam, you all right, buddy? Just hurt my ankle. Well, let's get you off of it. Come here, come here. [Both grunting] You had me so worried. You guys cannot keep doing this running away thing. - All right. - I'm serious, buddy. I was terrified. I guess we know how to get the kids to sleep, chase them through the woods. It was actually easier than chasing them through the house. I'm really happy that you're keeping them. I am too. Did you mean what you said about staying? I did. I hate my new job. I don't want to carry out someone else's vision. You are amazing at everything that you do. So you just need to believe in yourself this time. I have to believe in other people too. And like Sam, I was so scared to care about anyone because I d lose them. But I don't want to miss out on having someone great in my life. I'm not afraid anymore. [Doorbell rings] Hey, I'm sorry I'm so late. My refrigerator broke, and I needed to chase down my landlord, and then I was late for my investors meeting, and... - How did it go? - Well, thanks to the changes that Sam and Hannah made, they're going to fund my company. That's great. That's great. What's going on? Where's the nanny? Gave her the night off. Unagi. Whatever that is. - Eel. - Yuck. Yeah, they still won't eat it. But they know it's your favorite. Oh, honey, you didn't need to replace my shoes. Will you marry us? Yes. Yes. Yes. [Both chuckling]
