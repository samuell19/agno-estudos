Can I talk to you for a second? - Jack, I don't wanna have this conversation again. Alright? - Hey, just give me a chance. - No. - You're gonna like my ideas. - No. - Honest. - Dad. - What? - Don't ignore me on this one. - Amazing, listen, no. - No, no, no, no. - Ah, okay, alright, shoot. - Easter's coming up, right? So, I was thinking, what about an Easter egg hunt? Only instead of Easter eggs, people hunt pussy. It's genius right? Full monty, right? - Jack, it's an awful idea. - As your marketing manager-- - Hang on now, we've talked about this before. I let you run the Facebook page. That doesn't make you the marketing manager. - Dad, you've gotta start letting me take some responsibility here. I'm gonna manage this place one day. - You wanna manage a broke club with a bunch of over the hill strippers? Shit, sorry Gloria. - Oh, I've heard worse. My shift's over. - Right. - And, how do you feel about bunny ears, Gloria? - Oh, come on Gloria, come on, I'm tapped. You're supposed to be making it up with tips anyway. Mmm ... - New girl's out back by the way. - We got a new girl? - No, I've got a new girl. - What's she like? - Have a good night, boys. - I got more ideas. - Ugh, you've got ideas, huh? Alright, well, take them to uni. - Dad. - Go study, do something with your life. Yep. - Like, Dad, come on. - Are you gonna go on all night? - Look, okay, first off, what about a student night? - A student night? - Yeah, you know, cheap drinks, that sort of thing. - Uh, pass. - Pass? I already had these made up. Students will love 'em. - Students don't have any money, Jack. - That's not true. - It's true. - Roger, stay out of it, alright? I've already got a whole crate of them made up. What do you, what do you want me to do? Dad. You know those guys are back, right? They're in the girls toilets. - Alright, you, you are going to uni. End of story, it's a great opportunity. It's an opportunity I wish I'd had growing up. - Those blokes are trouble. I tell you, if I were 40 years younger ... - I'll have the money next week, it's coming. - Make sure you do, little girl. - It's not what it looks like. - Hmm, what is it then? - Get out of here. - Am I fired? - I thought I told you guys, I don't want that stuff in here. - Good stuff? What stuff? - The stuff that's in your hand there. Just get out of here, huh? Or, I call the cops. - No, no, we both know you don't wanna do that. - Dad, Dad. - I'm not in the mood, Jack. - No, no, Dad, Dad, that new girl. - That is one hot piece of ass. - You like to play games? I like to play games too. - What did he do? - When the label says dry clean only, it means dry clean only. - Did anyone tell you you look gorgeous by the moonlight? - Really? - Okay, I'm sorry. I, I'm not very good with the flowery prose. - Yes you are. So, Jack really doesn't want to study engineering? - He wants to manage the club. - He's his father's son. He's stubborn as a mule. - Yeah, well ... At the rate we're going, there's not gonna be a club for him to manage anyway. - Is it that bad? - Lana, there's no customers, I can't even afford to fix the roof, it leaks like a sieve. I got drug dealers coming in, selling to the girls. - Things will turn around. - No. No, it won't turn around, things are fucked. Look, I'm sorry, I just, I ... I, I don't know how to. - It's okay. I just wish I could find a way to make it all better. - Hey Roger, you think I could run this place, right? - Kid, have you ever seen my hemorrhoids? - No. - Exactly. Don't involve me in private business. - Hey, I'm just finishing up. Anything you need? - No, no, I'm good. I'm very good. Sorry, what was your name again? - I'm Tiffany. And you must be Jack, right? - Yeah, I uh ... Hey, you're doing really great in there. I'm the marketing manager. - You're the marketing manager? - Well, we're in a transitional phase. You're really good. - At tending bar? - Well, yeah. I mean, you ever consider following our other avenue of employment? - Put eight years of ballet training to work. - Ballet? Classy. So what makes such a classy lady like you wanna pursue this kind of vocation anyway? - Girl's gotta make a living. Wiping down tables sure beat getting your tits out. - Wait, Tiffany. - Yeah? - Maybe we could-- Oh, shit. Go lock yourself in your car. - Hey there, little girl. Where do you think you're going? - Get your hands off of me! - Ha ha, no, stick around. Whoa, did you see that? - Jack! - Fuck! - Just let me fucking go! - What the fuck! - Oh, my god. - Hey, if your lass could see, do you like that? Don't worry, it's only the tip. Mick, you think I should tickle her? - You'll take her apart. - Jack, Jack? I need help! - Your son has suffered a severe and sustained beating. He has a lot of minor cuts and bruises and he has several shallow flesh wounds on his abdomen. Frankly, he's fortunate the injuries weren't worse. - Fortunate, you think my son's fortunate? - Oh, under the circumstances. - He didn't mean it-- - Uh, if we see any sign of hemorrhaging, we'll see how we go. - You see why I don't want him involved? I told him, I fucking told him. - Max. - I'm going for a drink. - Max. Max, you can't just sit here drinking all night. - Oh, I can give it a good try though. - Come on. Max, you need to slow down. - I need to what, Lana? I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't know what the fuck to do, and you won't even help. - That's not fair. - Lana. You know people. You know people who can sort this whole mess out, but you won't even pick up the phone to help your son. - I'm not going back, Max. I'm never going back. That was a different lifetime. - Alright. Well, I'm taking my new friend out for a walk. And we're gonna have a talk. - Hey. - Hey. What's the matter? - You scared the shit outta me. - Well, I'm still in one piece. - I just came to see if you were okay. - I'm better than okay. They give jelly three times a day. It's better than home. So, uh, I was wanting to ask. You know, before the, uh-- - Oh, hey boss. I was just on my way. - I don't want to interrupt. - No, no it's okay, I was just leaving. Stay safe. - Thanks Dad. - Sorry. I didn't mean to cramp your style. Nice gown by the way. - This old thing? - Listen, Jack, um ... I'm, I'm sorry, I just uh ... This is why I don't want you involved in this sort of stuff, you know. I don't want my son growing up to, to manage some sleazy strip joint, getting older and broker and watching his life slip by. - Dad.` - No, you can do better than that. You can actually be something. You steer clear of the club, you know? Just, just until you know. - Come on, Dad, I'm seriously ... - Let me around, please. - Is he gonna be alright? I've come to see Yogi. - What if he's not here? - Then I'll wait. - Gentlemen, where are your manners? This man is our guest. Hello, Max. There's no need to get up on my account, please. Make yourself comfortable. I hear your young one had a run in with some of my boys. - They kicked the shit out of him, is more accurate. - Boys will be boys. - They're dealing drugs in my club. What I need is for-- - What you need to do, Max, is take a friendly word of advice. I'm a businessman. I own half this city. I just bought a theater to put on my own cabaret performances. And, do you know why I did that, Max? Because life is a cabaret, Max. And, I love the cabaret. Now, you're a businessman, for want of a better word. So, you should understand my position. - The understanding is I pay you money, and you don't trash my club. - And have we? - I don't have to let you sell drugs in there. - Do not fuck with me. It's really not in your best interests. - Fuck you, Yogi! - You haven't got the stones, you limp dick motherfucker. How's your wife? Ha ha, I'm bored. Show yourself out. - You can't push me around! Lana, we need to talk. - What is it? - You know I love you, right? Do you love me? - Yeah, I do, but why? - Then help me. Lana, please, I am begging you. I am in deep shit here. - Max, I can't. - Look at her. - How's it working out with the young one? - Jack? He's fine. - Oh, I know he is. Do you wanna talk about him? - Can a woman talk about anything else other than a man? - In a strip club? - I gotta go. - That girl has got issues. - And, that's why I left the Peace Corps, Max. You know, they say that the tropics are really good for your ...

You're scaring the customers. - Let me go! Let go, ow! - You want to knock over my furniture and break my pretty things? Well then Max, I shall do the same for you. Are you listening to me, Max?

Who do I kill? - Carlos, I just, I just wanna get rid of them. - The best way to get rid of someone is to kill someone. - Right. - Perhaps you're having second thoughts? - No, no, no.

Um, , so um, you know ... - If you don't want anyone killed, then I am the wrong man for the job. - Well, perhaps if you know, I start off by explaining the, the situation. - Lana explained it to me over the phone. I recommend killing the dealers. - What about Yogi? - You don't kill the boss. That's who we send the message to. You can't send a message to a dead man. - Yeah, no. No, I suppose you can't. Um, yeah, um, do you mind if I um, just think about um, just for a bit. Because ... Okay, um ... Sorry. Okay, um, yeah. Do it. - You pay me in cash, up front. - Uh yeah, um ... Um, of course, um, but uh, what about um-- - Up front. - But uh, what about-- Did uh, anyone see that guy leave? Hello. - I've come for dinner. - Carlos. - Good evening Lana. I hope I'm not interrupting. - Uh, well, actually um-- - Please, come in. What the fuck? - Great be Jesus. You will send a message for me. Tell this man Yogi that he is to leave my friend Max alone. Do you understand that? Never mind, I will send it myself. - Interesting guy. - I warned you Max. - So, what's the history there? - What history? - Between you two. - Let's not get into that, alright? The past is the past. - Fine. - What? - I'm just wondering what's happening Frank. - You're wondering what's happening? - Yeah. - You wanna be more specific? - You want me to be more specific? Alright, specifics. I mean, you got the case with car exploding out the back of the strip club, right? And so far, you can't find a single bit of evidence. - Kids. - Kids? Sure, but then you also got Jack Clifford, beaten to a pulp out the back of that same club, and not a single bit of evidence on that one either. - Kid's not pressing charges. - It's just that one would be forgiven for thinking the fancy new car you're driving around in may have something to do with the lack of evidence cropping up. But then half the department seems to be driving round in new cars. It's interesting. Was there a pay rise memo that I didn't get? I mean Jesus Christ Frank, I know the glass ceiling's still alive and well, but this is beyond the fucking pail. - You I.A. Cops, you're all the same. Looking to lay it on the rest of us, right? Bitch. - Have you seen this? Can you read? I'll read it for you. A passersby reports a loud explosion outside of local strip club, Thigh High. Police report finding a burnt out car at the scene. Who did this? I know it can't have been any of you guys, because I sure as shit never told you to blow anything up! Now you, yes you, you fucking monkey, go and find Scissors and his crew and find out what the fuck happened last night. Phht! I'm surrounded by fucking queers. - Fuck. Fuck! - Some detective came for you. - What, a detective? - Said he wanted to ask you some questions about last night. You know, the big explosion and everything. - Yeah, yeah, right. - I wrote his number down. It's in the office. - Okay, thanks Gloria. - What do you want? - I was just wondering uh, you did private parties. - Two grand for the night, 50 percent up front. - Okay. What are you, from the '80s or something? No checks, cash only. When's the gig? - Hello? - Hey Tiffany, how are you? Hey look, I was wondering... It's nothing important, you're not busy are you? - No, no. What is it Jack? - Well I thought maybe you'd like to, I dunno, maybe go somewhere with me, sometime. - Like, on a date? - Yeah, on a date or something. Or not. - I like you Jack. I just got a lot going on right now, and, I've gotta go, seeya. - And who might you be, handsome stranger? - It's not important. I'm a friend of Max Clifford's. - Ah, I see. - I wish for the violence toward my friends to cease. - Or else what? - Or else things will be unpleasant. - It's very direct. I like that. I didn't realize Max Clifford had such impressive, persuasive friends. I'll bet you a golden egg that know something about my missing friends. I'll take your advice into consideration. Find out who he is. - Hello? Hello? Brought my good anal beads for nothing. - Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in the petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time.

We spoke on the phone yesterday. - Uh ... Uh, yeah ... Um, yeah, yeah, um. Hi. - So, I wanted to meet with you to discuss the explosion the other day, but events seem to have kind of overtaken us. - You know, 20 years ago I-- - Who's that? - A friend of your father's, I guess. - Watch the bar for me Roger. - Alright. - So you don't know one single thing about a huge explosion out the back of your club? You don't know a single thing about one of your oldest employees being crucified and left on the street? And, my colleagues tell me you're a month behind with the payments. - Business has been bad. - I can see that. Listen, we don't give a shit about business. You pay us for protection. - Yeah well, maybe I don't feel very protected right now. - Well, maybe that's because you're behind by a month. - The only person I need protection from is Yogi. - You wanna think very long, and very hard about this, Max. - The time for thinking is over. Now, why don't you get out of my club? Go file a report or something. - You wanna be really careful Max. Things can get very dangerous without protection. - Oh, I got protection. Don't worry about me. - Where's he coming from? - Arrgh! - Good evening, Jack. - You. I, uh, wasn't spying on you. Really, I, I ... You killed those guys? - What guys are you talking about? - The guys from the gang. Right there, you forced them into a garotting wire with your car and you trapped one in a bear trap? - Which car?` - How did you do that? - You must be more careful Jack. There are dangerous people out there. It is not wise to follow strangers around. - How do you know my dad? - Your mother is an old friend of mine. I only met your father recently. I am helping him with some problems. - Yeah. It looks like it. - Take care Jack. It was nice to meet you. - Frank, hey. - What? - Geez. Someone got up on the wrong side of the bed. - What do you want? - You got the dead stripper case, didn't you? Lady hung up like our lord and savior? Yeah, which is interesting, because uh, you weren't assigned that case. - What's that got to do anything? - Maybe nothing. Maybe something. The only thing is, I heard you asked for the case. - So? - So you're a lazy shit Frank. So I was trying to rack my brain to figure out why you'd wanna take on another case. Any ideas? - Fuck you. - I didn't know you were coming? - It is a surprise. - I can't. - I apologize. - Thank you for coming by. - Hey! - Good evening, Jack. - Carlos is an old friend of mine. - Yeah, he said. We've met, you see? - He was just-- - Just coming for dinner, if I may. - Yeah, of course. - Jack, would you do the dishes honey? - Yeah, sure. - I'll help. - I know what you are. I wanna help. I wanna hurt these guys. - You'd be best served to stay out of it. - I don't give a shit about best served. I wanna kill these bastards. - Fine, you may help. - Who was that? - Let me ask you a question. - Okay. - Jack, do you like him? - He's got some good qualities. - Do you have feelings for him? - Do you? Breathe in and breathe out. You are strong. Inhale the positive energy and exhale the negative. Let the chakra flow through your body and tune your yin to your yang. Against the ... You are strong. You are powerful. You are a strong and powerful woman. Release your inner goddess. Count to 10 and just let the anxiety and adversity float away. Feel the positive vibrations from your head to your toes. From the tips of your fingers ... You are at peace. You are your inner goddess. - Hello, Max, why don't you join me? You seem shaken. - I just got shot up on my way here by four of Yogi's goons. - I will kill anyone you want killed, provided you pay. But, I advise not to kill any more members of this gang yet.

I made a mistake of letting go a long time ago. I regret it with everything I have. You want to learn my craft? Fine. Anyway, it's cold. Let's go. I have a date to keep. - So now what? - Exactly. Hello sir, I think you dropped something. - What? - Your bullets. - Your bullets? That was terrible. - What would you have said? - I don't know, like, literally anything else. - Whatever. I thought you were helping? - You said you'd teach me, nothing about me helping. You are the master of your own destiny. Listen to your inner voice and dis ... - You asked to meet? - Yes. - What can I do for you Max? - You'll take on any job if the money's there, right? Well, I've got a job for you. - Who is the contract? - Lana. Will you do it? - This is a most unforeseen request. - She's cheating on me. - I find this difficult to believe. - I don't know who with, but I know she is. I thought maybe you might know. - I know nothing about your wife's infidelities Max. - I know you used to love her. So I'm offering double the fee, double the fee. Will you do it? - Yes. - Good. I've got the money. It's not like I'm short right now. The club's booming. - Pay me after. - When? - Hello. Hello, Tiffany. - What do you want? - That's not quite the welcome I had expected. But considering the way I left things last time, it's quite understandable. Having fun with our friend are you? It smells like sex and regret in here. Tiffany, how could you do this to me? My own daughter dancing in some sleazy strip joint? Sleeping with some low rent hitman, flirting with Max Clifford's welp of a boy. You could have told me you were coming. Believe it or not, I only want what's best for you. - What's best for me? - I uh ... I know you think that I didn't want you. But nothing could be further from the truth. I just, I just want to be in your life somehow, sweetheart. Please. Please let me make up for being a shitty dad. - You need to leave. - Is that really what you want? Is it? - Yes. - Really? - You need to go! - Is this really-- - Yes! - What you want? - Yes! - You're nothing but a fucking whore like your mother. Tiffany, Tiffany! - Get off me! - Tiffany, Tiffany, stop! - Fuck you! - Stop! - You still at it, love? - There's a lot in these files. I mean, a lot. - So? - So that thug Yogi? He's been tearing this town up since well, forever, right? Every time his name turns up on something, Fiorentino or one of his lot gets the case. And then what? It all goes away, because money talks. But I just don't think Frank was as stupid as he looked. He's gonna have something on him just in case, something big. I just have to find it. - Try not to kill yourself, alright? - Oh, thanks. - I must have time. - I don't have any time. This needs to end now. I need to hit Max Clifford hard enough so that he pays attention to me. - Very well. I shall complete the contract within 24 hours. - One more thing. The boy dies too. And by the way, this is Fitz. Fitz, this is the Marquis De Sade. - Nice to meet ya. - I don't pay you to talk. He was very hard to find. Please try not to kill him. There is something that you should know. - Yeah? - Yogi has put out a contract for your mother, and for you. - You're gonna kill me? - A job is a job. And I have never broken a contract. - You gonna stare at me all night, Max? Fine. - I know what you've been doing. - What I'm doing? - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I've been pushed around my whole life Lana. My whole fucking life. But not now! No fucking way. - Max, you need to calm down. - Fuck you. You don't understand this, do you? Huh? - I understand the power. - That's right, it's power! That's what you do not get. - You know what? I don't need this. - What are you gonna do, Lana? You gonna run away, hey? You gonna run away, you're gonna, you're gonna become a single mum? Is that what you want? Because look how well it went last time for ya. - Fuck you, Max. - I think you need me a lot more than I fucking need you.

Please just, just listen to me, Lana, alright? I fucking love you, I love you more than anything, okay? You're the only one. You're the only one. And it is fucking over. It's over Lana.

I mean-- - Ask your husband. - You scum. - Well, what choice did I have? - What choice? What fucking choice? - And your son also. - Oh Jack? - I didn't ask you to do that. - That was a separate contract. - Oh my god, you couldn't. You didn't, tell me you didn't. - Oh you bastard. Do it. Do it! - No. - What do you mean, no? - I cannot. - Drop the gun. Get down on your knees. It's over. - Put it down Dad. - Buckle up, ladies. It's going to be a bumpy night.

Well, hello, Keeling. - Yogi Bramford, this is a pleasant surprise. - Is it? Fuck you, Keeling. - Oh, we don't have time for that Yogi. - What a pity. You've got nothing. Assault at best. - We had an anonymous tip off this morning. Found your daughter's body at the bottom of a cliff. Your fingerprints were all over it. We also found the remains of Detective Fiorentino there and six other bodies. You're going down. - Well ... Hmm, it wouldn't be the first time. - No, and it won't be the last either, I expect, not where you're heading. - Lana. We're going to be okay, right? - I don't think so, Max. - What now then, Mum? - Something better, Jack, something better. - Who do you think tipped off the cops? - Who knows? - Classy dame. You keeping it classy, Jack? - Yes ma'am. - Just remember, a good cop's never far away. ♪ I won't let me be myself ♪ ♪ No I won't let my body ♪ ♪ Hola hola hola hello ♪ ♪ Why you say goodbye ♪ ♪ When all I want is to say ♪ ♪ Hola hola hola hello ♪ ♪ You no say goodbye ♪ ♪ Me only want to say hello ♪ ♪ Hola hola hola hello ♪ ♪ Why you say goodbye ♪ ♪ When all I want is to say ♪ ♪ Hola hola hola hello ♪ ♪ Me no say goodbye ♪ ♪ We only want to say hello ♪ ♪ All my troubles are all okay ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and me are in it together ♪ ♪ All my problems have been allayed ♪ ♪ 'Cause me and you are in it together ♪ ♪ I was facing it alone ♪ ♪ Until you came along ♪ ♪ Now all my woes are gone ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and me ♪ ♪ Are in it together ♪ ♪ And my troubles are gone ♪ ♪ All my challenges are met ♪ ♪ All my answers are correct ♪ ♪ I have no more need to fret ♪ ♪ I have no more reason to forget ♪ ♪ I was facing it alone ♪ ♪ Until you came along ♪ ♪ All my problems ♪ ♪ Have been allayed ♪ ♪ 'Cause me and you are in it together ♪ ♪ All my troubles are all okay ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and me are in it together ♪ ♪ All I all I all I ♪ ♪ I was facing it alone ♪ ♪ Why do you say goodbye ♪ ♪ Until you came along ♪ ♪ All I all I all I ♪ ♪ Now all my woes are gone ♪ ♪ Why do you say goodbye ♪ ♪ And my troubles are gone ♪ ♪ All I all I all I ♪ ♪ All my challenges are met ♪ ♪ Why do you say goodbye ♪ ♪ My answers are correct ♪ ♪ All I all I all I ♪ ♪ I have no more need to fret ♪ ♪ All my problems ♪ ♪ Have been allayed ♪ ♪ No reason to forget ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and me are in it together ♪ ♪ 'Cause I was facing it alone ♪ ♪ All my troubles are all okay ♪ ♪ Until you came along ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and me ♪ ♪ Are in it together ♪ ♪ All my woes are gone ♪ ♪ My challenges are met ♪ ♪ My troubles are all gone ♪ ♪ My answers are correct ♪ ♪ I'll get my red Cadillac ♪ - I apologize.
