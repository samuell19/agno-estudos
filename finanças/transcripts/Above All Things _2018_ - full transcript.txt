(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) (groaning) - Bobby! Bobby, are you out here? - Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away. - [Man] Bobby, what... What are you doing, man? - I'm here. I'm out here. - Come inside. - Shit. - Fire's out. - Oh. Thanks. - [Man] You feeling all right, bud? (snapping) - Huh? Oh. Yeah, I'm okay. - What are you doing out on the lake? - Thinking. It's quiet out there. - (chuckles) It's quiet in here. How much have you had to drink tonight? - A little bit. Not much. - Well. You don't seem like yourself. - Well, Andrew, I'm not myself. - Anything you uh... Need? You know, we worry about you all the way out here with no car. - I don't want a car. And I don't need anything. - Is there anything you wanna talk about? - Nope. - All right, well. Food's in the cupboard. - Thanks. - We all loved her, you know. We're all going through this. I hate to see you like this, man. Check in on you tomorrow. (door shutting) - Don't bother. (dramatic music) (church bell ringing) (car honking) (tires screeching) (crashing) (woman screaming) (bird screeching) Bridgette? Bridgette? (glass breaking) Ah! Bridgette! (groaning) (phone vibrating) Oh, stop calling me. (wincing) Bridgette? (groaning) - Do you really need that? - Bridgette? - Yes, my love? - Bridgette! (ragged breathing) (pills rattling) (discordant music) (woman screaming) (screeching) Bridgette? Ah! Oh! One of them's still bleeding. Goddamn, I don't have time for this right now. (panting) Ah! (groaning) (doorbell chiming) (knocking) - Yes? Can I help you? - Hi, yeah I'm sorry to bother you. I saw you from across the lake. My family owns the cottage across. I hurt my foot and um... - Oh, please, Oh, come in, come in. I didn't know anybody else was on the lake. - Thank you. Yeah, we're not usually up here. I just uh... I'm here for a couple weeks staying at my in-laws cottage, the Burns. - Oh, the Burns family. - Yeah, they're kinda notorious around here. - Come in, come in. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, sorry to bother you, I just... I saw you from across the lake and uh, I ran out of first aid supplies, so. - How did this happen? - I cut my foot on some broken glass walking, and it hasn't really stopped bleeding. - Oh. Well, let me get my kit and I'll take a look at it. - Oh, thank you. Huh. This you? - [Woman] Yes, I caught that fish all on my own. - Ah. Here in this lake? - Here in this lake. - I didn't know we had fish that big. - Well, I think my husband used to stock it with fish just so that we could catch them, but I could never prove it. - Sounds like a character. - That he was, that he was. Now, let me take a look at this. - All right. (wincing) Sorry. I don't want to bleed on your floor here. - Oh God, I'll get a towel. - Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - Let me take a look. (wincing) - Ah! - Ah. - I didn't do such a swell job there. Here. - Can I help? - No, I can get it. - Okay, let me take a look. (Bobby sniffs) Now, I'm not kidding you. This is gonna hurt. - Well, I already hurt, so. - Are you ready? - Yeah, have at it. - Hold on, hold on. (Bobby wincing) There! - Ah, God, that was in my foot? - [Woman] It's getting pretty dark out, I should drive you home. - Oh, no, no, no. No cars. I can make my way. I like being on the lake. It's calm, peaceful. - It's none of my business, but were you out there last night? - Yeah, did I bother you? - No. - Sorry, if... - Well, who was doing all that hollering? - Oh, that was my brother-in-law, Andrew. - Little Andrew Burns. - Yeah. Well, he's not so little anymore. - Well, they all seemed little to me. They all grew up with my children. All those wonderful summers on this lake. - Hmm. - Bobby, I... I know we never met until now, but I knew who you were. I read about the auto accident in the papers. And I just... I just wanna say. I'm so sorry. Bridgette was a darling girl. - Yeah. Yeah, she was. (boat bumping the dock) - Whew, for a minute I didn't think you were coming back for me. Down here, right here. That's right, Bobby, this heavenly rum. - Oh God, what am I taking? - Some pretty darn good stuff, I'd say. (chuckles) - This isn't happening. - Making sure your nosy brother-in-law isn't there, that is smart. What a downer he is, really. - Oh, you know Andrew. Who, what am I talking to? - My name's Thelonious. Friends call me Theo. - We are not friends. - Not yet, but I can be pretty persuasive. - Based on the nascent stage of this budding friendship, I ask that you not talk. - Oh, I can keep quiet if you like. - I would like that very much, Thelonious. Maybe there's hope for us yet. - [Theo] No problem. - Oh. Okay, good. I'm going to sleep. I gotta stop talking to myself. - Goodnight! - Oh, crap, you are talking to me. - Only when my belly is full of this delicious beverage. When it goes, I go. It's my life source. - Hmm, mine too. - What is said while drunk is thought of beforehand. - What? - It's a Flemish proverb. It means when you're drunk, you're gonna say things that-- - Yeah, I can figure out what it means. Hmm. - [Theo] Say something there? - Why do these pills look different than those? - Maybe 'cause your pills are not those pills. Ever heard of Occam's Razor? Oh, William of Occam, what a sage. Well, he was a friar, much like myself, and he theorized among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected, or more simply put, the simplest answer tends to be the correct one. No, no! Not a band-aid! How are you gonna cover your cutting? - What did you say? - You heard me. Your cuts. (Bobby exhales) - Wow. I actually did that. - Hey, let me help you with that. Where were you yesterday? - I went for a walk. - You hurt yourself? - I twisted my ankle. - What's this stuff in the trashcan? - I cut myself shaving. - Mm-hmm. Look, man, is there anything that you-- - No. No, I don't wanna talk about anything. - Wasn't gonna ask you that. I was just gonna ask if there's, you know, anything else you need. - Sorry, I'm just sick of everyone asking if I wanna talk about things. No, I don't need anything else. Oh. Wait um... Rum. I could use another bottle of Old Monk. - (chuckles) I don't know if that's so wise. - You asked me if there's anything I need and then I tell you rum and you don't wanna get it for me. - I just think, you know. You've been hitting that stuff pretty hard lately, man. - And? - I don't think you need anymore. - No, you know what I need? Need being the operative word in that sentence. I need my wife back! Can you help me out with that? - No. - No, I didn't think so. So if you can't help me out with that, then I would like some more rum, please. And some band-aids. - Bobby-- - Just leave, please. - I'm sorry. Look, I'll... I'll stop by a little later or tomorrow or something. My mom might come by with little Gregory if you're up to it. - [Bobby] No. I can't take it from her. - Look, man, she doesn't mean to act like... That's just her way, you know. I'm sorry. Okay, then. I'm gonna head out. (door shutting) (light acoustic music) (clock ticking) - It's not what you think. I was, uh, chasing my flask. It went in the water and I was uh-- - You don't have to explain anything to me. - It was a bachelor party gift, I didn't really want to let it sink. - Hmm. How would you like some soup? - Please. - Clam chowder? - Sounds delicious. - Good. Made it this morning. - Thank you. I lied. I threw it in, the flask. I threw it in and I regretted immediately doing it and stood up to get it and I lost my balance and I guess I should... - You shouldn't have been drinking at nine o'clock in the morning. - Yeah. I just... I hate waking up without her there. - I know. When my husband died, the man in the picture with the trout. (Bobby laughs) I couldn't stand being alone. I couldn't stand not being with him. So I spent a lot of time in bed. - How long ago did he die? - Oh, about 20 years. - When did that feeling go away? - It doesn't go away. It gets better over time, but it doesn't really go away. And then something will remind you, you'll see someone who looks at you the way she looked at you or you'll hear a phrase the way she used to say it. You know, I used to think that I would see him everywhere a year after he died and one day, I really heard somebody call, "Maggie!" Really. I think it was his way of helping me manage things. - [Bobby] How did he die? - A heart attack. He was 45. We had kids. It was tough. So what do you do when you're not here? - I'm in advertising. - Oh, how exciting. Are you in one of those big firms on Madison Avenue? - Yeah. One of those. - Ah. - Mm. I'm a creative director. - Wow. And you're here because... - Took some personal time for a few weeks. My wife. - The accident. - We have a son. - [Maggie] A son? - Mm, he's with my mother-in-law right now. - Oh, Barbara? Oh. She is a force of nature. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, she is. (Maggie laughs) I don't think she thinks I can raise him on my own. - Well, it'll be tough, but. You're not going to be alone. - [Man's Voice] Oh, your hands are warm! - Hello? - Psst, hey. Right over here, down here. - Oh no, not another one. - You know, for most of us monks, the whole vow of silence thing really sucks. So when-- - Shut up. - You're, there's-- - I'm drinking you, not conversing with you. - Rude is the word that I'm thinking of. - Well, then stop talking. Andrew? Is that you man? Don't scare me. Oh, it's you. Look, buddy, this is private property. - I heard you on the lake. Came to see if you'd found any of my regiment. - Dude, it's late. You gotta give up the act. Is this a week long thing? - So you haven't seen any of-- - Nope, none. Look, Fahnestock State Park goes on for miles of that direction, they're probably all lost in there. You guys mostly from the city? - Fahnestock State Park? - Look, General. No disrespect, but if you wanna find your friends, I suggest you drop the act. I mean, seriously. I wish I had a map or some way you could call. It's gonna be cold in there. Okay, random, thought we were talking, guess not. Me thinketh this is stupid! You understand that? This is private property, buddy! - [Bottle] That was weird. - No comments outta you. - [Bottle] 'Kay. What is happening here, Bobby? Bobby? Bobby? So, Bobby, you all right? What did you do to Thelonious? - Oh, no, no, no. Don't you start. - Oh, I'll start in whenever I... Do you know why, 'cause this isn't right. We are only here to help you, Bobby. May I call you Bobby? Yeah, and guess what, pal? We're all you've got. - No. No, no, this isn't happening. - Oh yeah. Yeah, it's happening. 'Cause you have a long way to go before you hit bottom, my friend, and just remember, smooth seas make poor sailors. - Oh, great! More proverbs. - I'm full of 'em. Got 'em coming all day. You can't see the fox in the forest for the trees. - That's not even a proverb. (groaning) (sighs) Oh, shoot! Ah! (knocking on door) Shit! (glass breaking) Barbara, wow. Great to see you. Andrew didn't really mention that you were coming by. - Really? I told him to. And I left a few messages. So how are you doing? I brought over your medication from the drugstore and they gave you some extra so you don't have to go into town. You look well. - No, I don't, Barbara. We shouldn't lie to each other. - No, I guess we shouldn't. Actually, you look terrible and you stink of alcohol. - Well, you should know. - What? - I didn't mean it like that, I just meant that-- - If we're going for honesty here, I think you better clarify what you mean. - It was dumb of me to say, but all right. Your family isn't exactly a bunch of teetotalers. (Barbara laughs) - Well, I didn't come here to argue with you, Bobby, I just brought Gregory over here to see you. And a bottle of your favorite rum. - Oh. Thanks, I uh... - He is in the car asleep, though. - Probably should let him sleep, then. - Yes, I am. - Yeah and I don't want him to see me right now. I'm looking kinda rough. - Andrew's been over to see you a couple of times? - Yeah, he's... He comes by. Brings me things. Things I need. - That's good. Anything else you need? - No. I'm pretty good - Maybe I should go. - Oh, you just got here. Look, I know this is awkward. It's awkward for me, too. Do you want some coffee? - Sure, that would be nice. - Let me just wash out a mug for you, it'll just take a second. - Oh, I have the match of that one at the house, I should have brought it. - Oh, yeah, it's my favorite. Makes me feel like I'm really camping, like my dad and I used to do when I was little. - How is your father? - He's fine. I think. I haven't really talked to him in a while. I guess I haven't really talked to anybody in a while. - That's understandable. Listen, while you're doing that, I'll just go get the baby. - Huh? Oh, no, no, no, it's uh... No, I'll do that. Let me just get this going here. Oh, right, I was gonna go check on Gregory. (dramatic music) - He looks exactly like you. He's so precious. Like a little baby bird. - You're here. Your mother's inside. - I know, I see her judging you from the window. She's watching you to see how she'll act with him, so you can't talk to me or look at me or look towards me. Go on. Pick him up. - I can't do it, Bridge. I can't do this without you. I'm scared. I'm really, really scared. Bridgette. Bridgette? You can't keep doing this to me. You're either here or you're not, you can't have it both ways. He's still asleep. I didn't want to wake him. - Oh, well, I can't just leave him out there. I'll just go get the car seat and he can sleep in that. - No, no. I don't think that's a good idea. - Well, that's all right. We'll just be leaving, then. - No, no, no, no, here. Let me just-- - Look, I'll take Gregory back to the house. - Yeah. Maybe in a day or two. I'm sorry, Barbara, I'm not, I'm not really ready for all this right now. I'm not really myself these days. I don't... I don't know what to tell you. - Are you taking all of your medication? - Yeah, I don't think it's helping. I'm seeing... I'm not seeing clearly. - Well, it's been tough on all of us, Bobby. I lost my daughter. - I know. I wish it was me driving. - I think. I think it's best if we leave. - Yeah, I think that's best. We don't wanna go down that road again. - (chuckles) No. Why would we want to relive that? (door shutting) (car starting) (pills rattling) - Wow. That's... Pretty sad there, honey. You couldn't pick up our son and then you hit the liquor and the coffee like it's water. She's never gonna let you take-- - Leave me alone! You're not here anymore, you have no right to criticize me! - Oh, so you do feel something? That's good. - Please, stop. Please just stop this. (forcibly exhales) - Morning, sunshine. - You're here. - Yep. It's cold in here. - Oh, let me get you another blanket. I got this. I got this, I got this. - A blanket's not gonna help me. I need you to listen to me. I need you to get your act together. They're not gonna let you take care of-- - No, no, no, I got a blanket right here. No! No. No, I got you a blanket, don't go. (taking deep breaths) (wincing) Hey, Andrew. Yeah, it's me, Bobby. Yeah, I wanted to see if maybe you wanted to go for a walk, up in the woods. Yeah, like a hike. You know, I'm just... Just getting a little stir crazy in here and... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Uh-huh, yeah, well another time, then. Yep. Bridgette? - Hey, sunshine. - Bridgette. What are you doing? You look so pale. - I'm fine, I can't feel this. - But you look so pale. - Looks can be deceiving. Bobby, I need you to promise me you're gonna take care of our son. - It's not that easy, I... I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. - Baby, it doesn't matter. Please, just promise me you're not gonna let her do this. (branch snapping) - Hello? Andrew! What are you doing out here? - Once I got off the phone I started thinking, what am I gonna do at work? - Wait, work? What is today? - It's Tuesday, Bobby. - Oh. Sorry, I wouldn't have called you if I knew it was a work day. - Yeah, so I packed up my bag, you know, I called my boss, "I'll see you tomorrow." Came out here to get some fresh air with you. - Oh. Thanks. I'm shocked. Want some rum? - No, no, not really. Well, okay. Hey, were you saying something? I thought I heard your voice when I was coming up. - (scoffs) I've been talking to myself a lot. It's quiet at the lake house. - Bobby. Are you all right? - Sometimes I think that I am. Then this wave hits me, this tsunami of uncontrollable sadness and it just knocks me down. - I think that's normal. I think that's how you're supposed to feel. - And I can't get my feet under me or anything. You know? I miss her so much. And I don't think I'm handling that very well. I hurt. All the time and... Some things numb the pain, but. I wake up in the morning and it's still there, you know? And I want to stop hurting, but I can't stop hurting myself. I mean, I can barely even get into a car. I try to cry sometimes and then no tears come out, because it's like I have none left. And I have a son. And I can't help him, he can't help me. I can't be a father. I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. What am I supposed to do with a child, huh? Seriously. - I don't know. I don't, man. I won't pretend to. - Thanks. Thanks for not pretending to have all the answers. - Come on, let me take you to dinner at that diner we used to go to in high school. - I don't know if that's a good idea. - Why not? - I don't really wanna get into a car. I don't really wanna see people. I don't wanna leave the woods, the cabin. It's quiet here. I'm safe. - Come on. Come on. We're going. (Bobby sighs) - How many? - Two. - Follow me. This good? - Perfect. Startling, isn't it? - What? Did she say something? - Who? No, this place. It's like it doesn't change. It's like stuck in a time warp. Even that waitress is the same. - I think you're right. Thanks for bringing me here. - Yeah. Sorry it isn't one of those bougie restaurants like you like to go to in the city, but. - Oh, that was Bridgette that liked those. I was always much more comfortable in a place like this. - (chuckles) Yep, my sister turned into quite a little snob. - She liked the scene every once in a while. I know she was happiest when she would have a book, curled up by the fire at the lake house. I miss her. - Yeah, me too. Say, Bobby. Susan and I were talking. We'd love to have little Gregory come stay with us, you know, for a little while, just till you get like, you know, a little sturdier. Yeah, my mom can't look after him forever. She's getting old and it'll be really good training wheels for us, you know. Having a kid of our own. It's all Susan talks about. You know, the doctor said kinda tick tock, so. - You really think that's a good idea? - My mom does. - I know what Barbara thinks about it. - Yeah, but like, you know, Susan and I discussed it with her and, you know, we all agree it's probably for the best. Obviously we need, you know, your go ahead, but. - Really? - Yeah, really. - What about your work and daycare? - Susan's actually leaving her job, so she can watch Gregory full time. - Well. Let me think about it. - Yeah. - I don't know, man. I'll have to check with Bridgette. - Well, you know, think it over. Take all the time you need. - Have you all decided what you want? - I will have a cheeseburger, but instead of french fries, I will have coleslaw. - Order never changes, ever since we were kids. - And you? - I always get the same thing, but today I think I want the meatloaf. But instead of french fries, can I have a baked potato? - [Waitress] Okay. - Ooh! - And to drink? - Yeah, I'll have a Dos Equis. - Me, too. - Okay, sounds good. I'll get your order in and I'll be right back with your beers. - Thank you. I swear she hasn't changed. - Rachel or. I don't know, I didn't see her name tag. 'Night. Bridgette? Are you here? (eerie music) Oh my God! Bridgette, what are you doing? Why are you like this, what's happening? - Why are you giving our son away, Bobby? - What? What? What are you, what are you talking about? - Can't you see what they're trying to do? They can't have a child of their own, so they're trying to take ours. - No, Bridgette, it's not like that. - Then tell me what it is like. I'm curious to hear how you think this is gonna play itself out. - Oh, gosh. You're so cold, let me get you a blanket. It's cold in here, Bridgette! Thanks a lot! (screeching) Bridgette! What are you doing? You're scaring me! What are you doing out there? (crashing) Bridgette what are... (lock clicking) Oh. What am I doing? (line ringing) - [Andrew] Hey, you've reached Andrew. - Ah. (ragged breathing) I... Andrew? Hey, it's me. Yeah, I just wanted to call and say thanks again for dinner. And (stammering) I'm not seeing... I just... I'm not feeling too well and I could use a little company. I don't know if, no, I guess I didn't mention that. I guess I was too busy (whispering quietly) myself. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, this is a rambling message. I just... Yeah, give me a call back when you get this. And we can talk and maybe I'll be a little more coherent. You just, you know, like... (screeching) (unlocking door) - Maggie, you home? Can I come over? (Muzak playing) (sighing) Maggie! (knocking) Oh, Maggie! (knocking) Maggie, sorry to bother you, but I saw your light on, so I came over. (stammering) I'm not feeling too well. - Hello. - Hey. - Can I get this and a bottle of Old Monk? - Oh, sorry, all sold out. - Sold out? - Yeah, my wife delivered the last case of it yesterday. - Oh, shit. I tied you up. - Must be some kinda bachelorette party or something going on up at the lake. - What? - Yeah, I've never sold so much of the stuff. Next case won't be in until next month. I have other rums, though, if you-- - Hey, wait a minute, did you, Did you sell it to this guy? - No. To her. - Come on, Bridgette, why are you doing this? I didn't do anything! Nothing is gonna happen to Gregory! No one is gonna take him! I'm gonna have to walk back home through the woods now! Is that what you want? - All right. You know, the Captain Morgan is really a lot-- - Nah. - You want your change? - [Andrew] No. - Random. (phone vibrating) (knocking on door) - Maggie. (phone vibrating) Oh, she must be out. (phone vibrating) (Bobby yawns) - Bobby! (knocking) Bobby, you here? Bobby! (mobile vibrating) Bobby? Bobby, are you out there? Bobby! Hey! Hey, Bobby! Get up, Bobby! I'm coming, Bob! (car door shutting) Hello? Hello? Bobby? Hey! Bobby! Bobby, wake up! - What? What? Wait, what's going on? Where... Where am I? - You're at a cabin across the lake. - It's cold. Oh. Oh, Bridgette took my boat. - Bridgette did not take your boat, Bobby. You're in shock. What are you doing over here? - Miss Maggie's light was on and I came over to... I didn't want to be alone, I should've asked you to stay. - What? Who is Maggie? - Mrs. Moss. This is her house. She remembers you from when you were a little kid. - Dude, the Mosses haven't been up here in years. - No, I had lunch here. I had soup. - Soup? How many pills have you taken? - Some. - Have you been drinking? - No. - Don't lie to me, Bobby. - No. - I went to the liquor store. - No, no, no, no, I didn't drink those, I just. I wanted to hear what they had to say. They don't talk unless they're full. - Okay, let's, let's get you to the hospital, man. Can you stand? - Of course I can stand. Wait. - Hey. - No, Maggie. Maggie Was here. She was in there. - Look, man, we can talk about it later, all right? Let's just, let's get you to the hospital. - No, I'm not, don't take me there. - Bobby, I need to have a doctor look at you. I don't know why you're hallucinating. - Don't take me there. They let Bridgette die. - They didn't let Bridgette die. It was an accident, man. It was an accident. - I shoulda been the one driving, it shoulda been me. - That's not how it went, all right? It's just, it's not. Okay? Let's get you to a hospital. - No. Take me to the cabin. Take me to the cabin, I'll warm up. I'll be fine. - All right. Just, let's get in the car. (loud banging) Bobby! - Whoa, how did that get here? Wait, that's weird. She brought the boat back. - Who? - Bridgette. - Robert, Bridgette did not bring the boat back! - No, when I came down here earlier to go home, she was sitting on it in the middle of the lake and she was really angry at me! - What was she angry about? - She thought I was giving away Gregory to you and Susan. - Dude, this is getting ridiculous! What are you doing? - I'm going to tie the boat up. - What? What is that stuff? Come on, Bobby. We're gonna go, all right? I'm thinking you didn't tie the boat up, we'll grab it in the morning. We gotta get you warm. - I threw all that stuff in the lake! - Bobby, I don't know what you think you-- - Look, did you see that? - What? - The curtain just moved in Maggie's house, she's gotta be home now. - Bobby, no one has been there in 10 years! Why can't you see that? I told you. This is a bad idea! Look, that is a very, very bad idea, man. We've had enough drama for one night, let's go home. - No, I have to see. I was here. This was so real. - Bobby, I will bring you back first thing tomorrow and you can look around to your heart's content in the daytime, okay? Come on. - What is happening to me? Is this a dream? Is this just a bad dream? - What? What are you talking about? - This. I can't tell what's real and what's fake anymore. - This is real, Bobby. Okay? All this is real. Look, man, I think you've suffered a traumatic experience and it's making you hear things and see things and believe things that don't exist, okay? And you couple that with a lot of self medication and voila! - Psychotic break? - Hey, I don't know what they'd call it, but. - I know. - Bobby. I'm not judging you, all right? I have no idea what you're going through, losing the love of your life like that, but she was my little sister, okay? It's been tough on all of us. Especially you and my mom. - Barbara was right. It should've been me, it would've been easier if I'd died. I just, I don't know if I can go on. Bridgette was so much stronger. I just, I can't. - Bobby. Hey, let's get you inside, man. Okay? - Okay. - Cool? - And Andrew, don't leave me. Don't leave me even for a second, okay? - Okay. - That's when she comes, that's when she comes for me. - Look, I won't, man, all right? - And I'm the only one who can see her. Her and General Washington. - What? - I sometimes see General Washington, too, in the lake and in the woods. I thought it was reenactors at first, but now I'm not so sure. - Oh, boy. Okay, yeah. Let's go inside. Classic. Well, at least the car started. - Oh, the light's been flickering. Something must be loose. I keep meaning to check it out. - You should. I'm just gonna start a fire, man. - All right. - Hey, get over here, man. Warm up now. I'm gonna get you a blanket, too. - Oh, that sounds nice. Oh, and a shot, too. - Okay. Just this once. I'm gonna have one, too. - Oh, wait, I'll get it! - [Andrew] Robert. - I can explain that. - Can you? - They just showed up. They're very wise. - Yeah, that's not really a great explanation, Bobby. - They're all I've got. - Dude, you named them? - They have names. They'll tell you, if you listen. (eerie music) It's her. She was just there, I swear! - You gotta stop doing this to yourself, man. Bridgette is gone. - It was so real. - Tomorrow morning I am taking you to a doctor. If you don't wanna go to the hospital up here, I'll take you to one in the city, but. - Andrew? - Yes? - I'm scared, man. I don't think I'm gonna make it through the night. - Of course you are. - No, I got a bad feeling about this night. - Bobby, I will stay up the entire night with you. - I don't think you can stop it. - What are you saying? - I don't know, I don't know. It's gonna be a long night. - Uh-huh. - People can die of fright, can't they? (loud banging) - Okay, that is weird. - See? - I thought you tied it up-- - See, I told you something was going on! - Under no circumstance are you to go get in that boat. - You don't have to tell me twice. - All right, but. I'm gonna go tie it up so we don't have to deal with this in the morning. - Hey, look. It's empty now. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, where'd all that stuff go? - I don't know, man. I don't care. - [Bobby] Ho! - Whoa, whoa! All right, screw this. Let's go back inside. I never thought I'd lock the door up here. - I started locking it after those reenactors got lost. (Bobby shouts) - Ah! Dude, you gotta relax, there's no one there. - You just can't see her! - All right, that's it, man. Get your stuff, we're getting out of here, all right? - Oh no, no, no, no, we're not going out there. - Yeah, we are, all right? Pack up your things, I'm gonna call my mom, I'm gonna tell her we're coming over there. - What makes you think we're gonna be safer over there? - I don't know, but like, we'll be near civilization and I'll be near a sane person. - I don't know, man, I don't know if I can make it to the car I just, I can't. - Dude, what are you seeing? - I'm seeing Bridgette. And she looks so angry, like she's possessed. - Okay, that's it. I'm gonna grab your stuff. - Okay, okay. - Huh. - What? - It's super late and I'm getting a busy signal at my mom's house. - Maybe she's on the phone or-- - When was the last time you heard a busy signal, man? - Well, try my phone. - (gulps) That's not good. - It can't be dead, I had a full charge. - Whatever, man, she'll be happy to see you. (pounding) - Oh, what was that? - Maybe a bird hit the window. - At this hour? - What, like, or a bat? - Oh, you're not going out there! - I'm going to go see what that was, Bobby. Ew. - [Bobby] What is it? - Frogs. - Frogs? - Yeah. - Oh. Well, what are they doing flying at the window? - Look, man, I don't think it's their decision, okay? We're getting out of here! - Those frogs are like biblical. - I've heard that sometimes in storms the wind can whip 'em up. - Well, it's not storming! - Not yet, man, which is why we're going now. Because I'm not getting stuck in here with a storm that's strong enough to throw freakin' frogs around with you! - All right, I don't even need to pack. We'll come back for it tomorrow. (jostling door) - Unlock it, Bobby. (lock clicks) (wind gusting) - Oh, shit! I didn't do that. - Yeah, it was the wind, all right? Because it's not storming yet, but it is coming. If we're going, that is the sign to go now. - I don't care if it makes me sound like a pussy, I'm so fucking scared. - Everything's gonna be fine, Bobby. We're just gonna get in the car and we're gonna go. (keys jangling) (splash) Shit! - What? - Nothing. - What? What, I don't like the sound of that. - Just go to the car, Bobby, you're still freaking me out. Bobby, I need you to promise me you're going to stay calm. - Why, what happened? - Just, are you gonna stay calm? - Why, what happened? - That sound you heard? When I pulled my phone out of my pocket, I dropped the keys in the lake. - What? - You got me on edge, man! I'm doing stupid stuff. Just, look, I can call the company, they can open it and start it from the satellite. - Well, call them! - That's what I'm doing. (sighs) Come on. Hi, this is Andrew Burns. I just lost my keys in a lake. Yeah. I just need you to open it and start it. And the password is interzone. Yeah. Uh-huh. (car alarm beeps) - Oh! - My God, thank you. (rock music) - Oh, thank God for technology. I was about to lose my shit. - See, like I said, nothing to worry about. - Don't say stuff like that. We still have to get out of here. - You're right, I'll-- - Whoa, look out! - What the hell is your problem? - You didn't see her? - Bobby, if you say Bridgette, so help me god, I will. I don't know what I'll do. - Well. I'm not gonna say it, but it was her. - Dude. I was gonna try and let tonight slide after we got to my mom's house, but now I really don't think I can. You're clearly a danger to others and yourself. Get in the back seat. Get in the back! - Okay. I can't believe you didn't see her. - I didn't see her, Bobby, because she's not there, okay? - Well, she's very real to me. - Yeah, I can see that and we're gonna get you some help, okay? - What about the boat? The stuff in the boat, the frogs. - You think Bridgette is doing that? How, Bobby? That doesn't make any sense. - No, she's mad at me! She thinks that I'm giving Gregory away or that I can't take care of him on my own. She's trying to snap me out of it. - Nobody is gonna take Gregory away from you, Bobby, okay? Now just promise me you're not gonna do anything else stupid and let's get to my mom's house. (engine dying) - Whoa, wait, what was that? - The engine just died. - Well, call them back and have them restart it. - Hi, this is Andrew Burns. I just called a few minutes ago to have my car started. Yeah, well, it's just died on me again. Could you? Oh, thanks. Nope, nothing is happening. Yeah, the password is interzone. Could you just try it again? No, tomorrow is not good, okay? I have to get to work in the morning. No. No! - Wait. That doesn't sound good. - Yeah, well, that's 'cause it's not good, Bobby! Right now I need you to remain calm. - I am calm! - With the swift jerky movement of the car you just had us make and the fact that I just called them to have them unlock it and start it, their security team has ruled this suspicious behavior and killed my engine. - Wait, they can do that? - They just did, so-- - Well, didn't you tell them? - Yeah, I did tell them. - So what do we do now? - We wait until tomorrow morning, when someone comes from the local garage and verifies that I'm me. - Shh! - What do you think, you think someone's gonna come get us? Like George Washington's gonna stab us with a bayonet? - I don't know! - Bobby, the only dangerous thing I see around here is you, okay? It's you! - Call Barbara, call your mom. Have her come pick us up. - It's like two AM. I'm not calling my mom to tell her to come get us 'cause we're scared of the dark! - Yes, that's exactly what you're gonna tell her! - No. - No, call her. - This is ridiculous. You're losing your shit, man. - Well, tell her that! Tell her that I'm losing my shit and she needs to come pick us up! - Okay, all right. Well, that might actually work. Can we just go inside? - Just call her. I'm not gonna make it to the morning. I think I'm gonna crack. - I think you've already cracked. Okay, okay. (Andrew sighs) - Hey, Mom. Sorry to bother you so late, but if you get this could you give me a call back? Bobby isn't feeling so well and I was gonna bring him over to your house, but. Long story short is my car is dead and then we've gotta wait till the morning for the garage guy to come and, just, just if you get this can you just call me back? Service at the cabin is terrible, so just... Just keep trying till you get me, okay? Thanks. - So. So now what? - Well, I don't know about you, man, but I'm going inside. I'm gonna start a fire and try and get some sleep. - I think I'm gonna stay here. - Suit yourself. - Oh, you're just gonna leave me here? - Leave you? I told you to come inside, you don't want to. So I'm gonna go inside, I'm gonna start a fire, and I'm gonna try and get some sleep. - Well, I'm gonna stay here! - Do you really think that you're safer out here? - I don't know. I don't know why I should be safer or less safe anywhere. - Yeah, exactly! But it seems like you're safer with me. So come on, Bobby. Get out of the car. - No. (thunder rolling) (loud banging) - Ah! - Relax, man, it's just me. I tackled Abe Lincoln to get that for you. - Very funny. Abe Lincoln's not even from around here. - What? He's also dead. - [Andrew] Are you really gonna stay out here all night? - Yes. I feel safer out in the car. - You sure? - Yes, thank you. - Sure? I got a really big fire going. And actually, I bumped into Jesus-- - Okay. - You know, he's gonna pop in for a nightcap. - Mm-hmm, yeah, great. - Turns out he's a really big fan of Old Monk. - Oh, wonderful. - I mean, it make sense. - It's very funny, that's very, very funny. - I thought so. - I'll be fine, thank you. - (quietly) You're welcome. All right. Night, Bobby. - 'Night. (wind blowing) What the fuck, Bridgette? Are you trying to kill me? - Bobby? Please don't tell me you're talking to Bridgette again. I've had about enough of this, man. What? Why did you move my car? - It slipped into gear. - I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. - It started rolling toward the lake and I hit the emergency brake. Did you put it on? - I don't know, man. I'm exhausted, it's a habit. Like, I don't know, I'm super stressed out. Are you staying out here or not? - No, I'm coming in. - Good, that's settled. Come on. And I fixed that fuse, so the light's on. - You can take the bed. I'm gonna curl up by the fire in the blanket. - [Andrew] You sure? - Yeah. I'm not gonna be doing much sleeping anyway. - Suit yourself. Well, if you change your mind. - [Bobby] I'm all right. (fire crackling) (thunder rolling) (wind blowing) (loud slamming) Andrew, you still awake? (footsteps approaching) (Bobby gasps) - I heard something too, that time. - [Bobby] Oh, thank God. - I thought it was the wind, but I waited then I heard footsteps. - Oh, it's Bridgette. - Do you see her right now? - No, but it had to be her. - What does she want? - I don't know. I think she's trying to warn me about something. - Are you gonna close the door? - Could you do it? - I think it's probably better if you do it. (floorboards creaking) (thunder rolling) (knocking) - [Barbara] Why did you lock the door? - Oh, shit. Coming, Mom. - I got the message you left last night and I came right over. Sorry I didn't get it earlier. I turn my phone off at night. - That's the thing with cell phones, Mom, is you just leave 'em on. Well, nevermind. - What's wrong? You both look like you didn't get any sleep last night. - Yeah, we didn't. Bobby here was kinda seeing things and some Bangladeshi call center killed my car. Just, long night. But it seems pretty far away now. - Hmm. (chuckles) All right. Let's get you both to my house. - Where's Gregory? - Oh, Gregory's in the car. Why don't you go get him? - Yeah, I gotta get to some service. I gotta call work and tell them I'm gonna be late and I gotta call the garage. - Oh, I called the garage for you. - Okay. Well, I'm gonna head out to the car. - All right, well, we're just gonna take a couple minutes to pick up around here. - [Andrew] I'll grab your stuff, Bobby. - Oh, thanks. (baby cooing) Oh no, no, no, no. No. Gregory! - Bobby! - Gregory! (Gregory crying) - What the fuck? - No, no, no, no. - Bobby! Hey, Bobby. - Keep away from me! You! She was warning me about you! - Hey, you see this, right? This looks just like Bridgette's. - Yes, I know, I had the garage guy drop it off since he was coming over anyway. - What are you talking about? Who does that? You're... You're sick! Bobby! - He's not going to destroy two generations of this family. - Ma, he wasn't always like-- - I gave him the shovel, but he dug the hole. And he's right. He should've been driving. - [Andrew] Bobby? Bobby!
