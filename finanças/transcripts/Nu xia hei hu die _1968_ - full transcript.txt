- Chief, we propose a toast for you. - Ok. Second chief, this must've been a hard trip. Here, let me raise you a toast. I'd even risk my life working for you, was not hard at all. Right, second chief, let's have a good time tonight. We'll all raise a toast to you. Come on brothers, let's toast to the second chief. - Right, a toast for the second chief. - Thank you. King Pingliang gave you 3000 taels of gold for recruiting troops. He'll send you orders later, he promised that if he succeeds, he'll make you a duke, Black Butterfly again. - He takes our Five Devils Rock as nothing. - What the hell? How dare he? He's been stealing gold from us. Chief, send invitation to boxers of different schools. Asking them if they know who Black Butterfly is. If other boxers know we were robbed, five Devils Rock will lose reputation. Right, we need to investigate silently. Chief, Black Butterfly is a very skilful fighter, he's definitely someone important. He takes on us deliberately, I think there must be reasons behind it. Perhaps I could get some information over at tea. - Ok, be careful. - Sure. Court of Censors. - Master Liu... - Don't call me master, make me seems old. Mr. Liu really likes to make fun. Mr. Liu. Why there's so few taking congee tonight? Even I don't know why. The victims are all gone, they weren't hungry. - Tastes good, why shouldn't they come? - Right, it's strange. - Xi Lang, something strange happened. - Mr. Yu, what did you see? A beggar is giving away rice, its very strange. Our lord give congee and a beggar gives rice, he's insulting our lord on purpose. - A beggar giving away rice? - Yes, right at the Beidi temple. Everyone can take up to two pounds. - How much car a beggar earn? - Mr. Liu, it sounds so strange. - The beggar never asks money. - What? Come on. Could it be King Pingnan vying for people's respect? Possibly, I'll go and report to the lord, you go there and take a look. Ok. - Your name? - Wang Guisheng. - Address? - Shajia Village. Come on. Come on. - Ok. - Thanks. Next. Xie Daozi. - Which rice shop are you from? - I'm from Dafa Rica Shop. - What's the matter? - Who are you working for? Te Drunken Beggar. - The Drunken Beggar? - Don't you knew him? The old man who always gets drunk and acts crazy. - Where he gets the money? - It's not a proper thing to ask him. - Where's he? - Ha is in the temple. - No one is in the temple. - Strange, I just heard him singing inside. Probably he's drinking at Ten Mile Inn now. Ten Mile Inn? - Little Poue. - Yes? - Look at your plate. - No wonder it's so light. You're always ignorant, that's for the two gentlemen by the window. Xi Lang... - How come you are here? - I'm looking someone, where's the master? He's raising money for the victims. - Who you looking for? - Someone called the Drunken Beggar. He's over there. - Why you looking for him? - The lord wants to speak with him. I won't blame you for doing your work but if you bother my old customer... - I could lose my temper. - I understand. - Cheers, come on. - No. Thanks. Wine is so good you shouldn't avoid it. Listen to me, the jade liquid stays in my cheeks. It's so sweet, fresh and fragrant. Visiting three wine shops in a row. People stop their carnages and horses, Dongbin was drunk and left without his sword. Libai sold his officer's crown in order to buy wine. Fairies love the wine but net their home, they get drunk under moonlight. - Come on, drink. - No, I'm working now, I can't drink. Damn it, I meet a officer. Hey, stop pretending be mad, here you are trying to win the hearts of people. - Come with me to the Court of Censors. - I can't hear you, say it again but louder. - You? - Xi Lang, remember what you said? I said that I want this gentleman come to see our lord. Am I right? The poor can't be involve in charity activities or he'll be in trouble. Let's go, I'll explain everything, come. You're summoned before the court I want to ask you questions about your charity. Sir, is helping someone breaking the law? - Your office does the same thing as well. - No, you're doing something good/. But I don't understand how you became wealthy? You mean I stole and became wealthy? - Well? - Burglary? - No? - Since I'm not a thief nor bandit. Why you want to know where my money comes from? Well. You seem so poor and broke that I feel suspicious. Your Honor, this is strange. Wealthy people don't give away their money bur I'm willing to give away mine. But you've to ask me the reason. What you do will scare away those who wish to help the victims. Well... In Kiang Shan County and its surrounding areas no thief or bandit was reported. You've doubt about the source of my money. I think you must've evidence. I just want to make it clear. - Then I'm not guilty. - Well, yes. - Can I go now? - Sure. Thank you. He's very eloquent, it must be something behind his camouflage. - Xi Lang. - Godfather. As a front, I was ordered to check the damage... caused by the natural disaster. In fact, I need to... collect the evidence of King Pingliang's betrayal. This man looks crazy but speaks like an educated man, so I feel doubtful. - You suspect he's connected with Pingliang? - Very possible, take a closer look on him. Right, I'll work closely on him. How come you're back so fast? What they want with you? I guessed right, it's all about the rice distribution in the temple. They're so stupid, they're just stunned by my questions. Keeper, get me some wine. Drunken Beggar, you're back. How come you are here again? I want to see the master, hasn't he came back? People stop their carriages and horses. Is this for him? I'll deliver it for you. Fairies love the wine but net their homes, they get drunk under moonlight. - Started a new business? - You really love to make fun. Serve wine, please. Sit down and drink with me. No, I'll serve the wine for you. - You want to take advantage of me again? - Don't take me wrong. I admire that you're a very brave man, I want to know you better. Officers like you always act like this, covering the traps with a smiling face. Wine, serve me wine. - Don't laugh at me. - This smile is not real as well. Old sir, should I put on a bitter face? Kid, you're honest in this way. Dad. - Master? The master is back. - Little Poue, get me some water. Sure. He's probably messed up again. You guess right, I messed up three times. - Who dared rebuff our master? - No one but those wealthy people. Where you went with father? Mr. Liu. Zhang and Qian Master even tried to go to Mr Jin. Master was very angry, his face turned pale. No mere rebuff, finally I dragged him back. We asked these wealthy men to donate for the victims. They felt like we're taking their lives away. You're Gold Sword Kwan, influential in fighter's world but not to these misers. You lost respect very badly this time. Those bastards didn't pay any attention to our earnest objections. So we'll have to resort to violence. Help. Help, hurry. Help, thief, thief. - Lady, what happened? - What's the matter? What's the matter? - Bandit. - Where? - Where? - The bandit is in purple. Let me go. Please let me go. Come on, take it. If you do what I want I will give you some jewels. Mercy, please. Mercy, please. - Please, don't kill me. - Hey... - Where's the bandit? - Bandit? Where are the gold and silver and the jewelry? - What is this? - Who are on duty? - Here. - You checked the lord's desk? - Anything other than documents on the table? - Yes. What is this? Sir. Please, give this the poor and help them for me. Godfather, there's a black butterfly here. - Keep it for the investigation. - Right. - Mr. Tang, please wait here. - Yes. The Lord is here. - I'm the officer of Kiang Shan County. - Please take a seat. Thank you. - Greeting sir. - Their were robbed by bandits last night. This is the list of stolen items. When the bandit left, leave a black butterfly. - Black Butterfly? Let me see it. - Sure. - Xi Lang. - Sir. Black Butterfly is an outlaw, investigate now, I want him capture as soon as possible. Yes. Xi Lang, you're coming early. - Bao Zhu. - Brother. - What did you say to dad? - Come on. Three wealthy men were really robbed last nigh. - Robbed? - How that concern my dad? - It must be done by the master. - No way, I dad hears that, he'll slap you. Xi Lang, what the hell are you doing there? - Dad, he thinks you're a thief. - What? In all my life I've never take the smallest thing from anybody. Why you think that? You failed to raise money yesterday, I saw you were angry. It so happens that lest night 3 wealthy men were robbed. - Robbed by bandit? - And a pretty graceful bandit. He left a Black Butterfly when he left. - I thought... - You thought was me. Bullshit, how could I do this kind of a thing? Right? I wild guess too. Good morning. Master, perhaps was done by the Drunken beggar? Don't accuse me of any crime. - You knew it? - Knew what? - The crimes you mentioned, the robberies. - Who knows. Whenever you pay attention to me, it is not good. Last night, 3 wealthy men were robbed. They deserve it. Keeper, come on. Fill it full, give me 4 taels. - Mr. Kwan. - Mr. Jin. Good morning, please sit down. Mr. Jin. - Sit. - Thanks. Mr. Kwan, we're old friends, let me put it straight. You must know already whatever happened to Mr. Liu, Zhang and Qian. I invite you to come to my home to help me. - You want me to guard you? - Yes, please help me. You know, I've been out of the business for years. Only for this time Mr. Kwan. Mr. Kwan, if you're there, Black Butterfly wouldn't dare to come. Let me do it. Mr. Kwan, if you refuse... people will think you're scared of Black Butterfly. If Black Butterfly robbed there will means that he has no integrity, that he disdain me. Ok, I'll go to your house and wait for Black Butterfly. - Good. - Mr. Jin, my dad is old, you... No way, Mr. Kwan is old but still strong. Bao Zhu, it's none of your business. I'm old, but still skilful at swordplay. I need to take on this Black Butterfly. - I'll go with you. - Go with me? - Where? - I'll spend a night in the prison. If anything happens tonight, you won't suspect me of being Black Butterfly. - Isn't too much for you? - No, let's go. - Let's go. - Ok? Master, I'm leaving. Keeper, here's the money for the wine. Let's go. This is the inherited treasure of my Jin family. - This is what I want you to protect tonight. - Sure. You need to know that I won't come again tomorrow. Of course, tomorrow morning the chieftain of the security company will come. This was prepared for you, thank you for your hard work tonight, - Ok, leave it to me. - Thank you, - Mr. Kwan, see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Help. - Sir, it's me. - Sir. I broke a flowerpot. - What? - Did you see anything? Nothing, nothing. - Just bumped into a flower pot, see you. - See you tomorrow. Shit. Move away. There. Disappeared. Let's split and search. - There. - Go. Who are you? Making a case here you have made me lose my self respect. Hold it. Black Butterfly, I'm expecting you. Come down and show me your skills. Nowhere to run. Freeze. There. Go. You've no place to go. - Surround him. - Right. Go. Go. There. After him. Master... It's too late. Xi Lang... You've come at this late hour but you don't say a word. What's the matter with you? Master, don't make fun of me. When have I make fun of you? If I did anything wrong, you just have to tell me. - Why you treat me like this? - Just tell me straight away. - Don't hem and haw. - You just stirred up the Court of Censers. How can I explain to my godfather? It sounds like Black Butterfly paid a visit to the Court of Censors. You suspect me again? In Kiang Shan County, no one has such skills except you. Don't make a wild guess. I was also faced with failure. - You also? - He stole things when I was guarding. Isn't he too good? I chased after him but couldn't catch him. I was fooled around by him. If people know this. The name of Goldswords Kwan will lose respectability. Dad. - Who are you angry with? - Is because you are awakened. You were talking about losing respect, what is all about? Nothing. Xi Lang. - What's wrong with your arm? - Nothing, just a scratch. How it happened? - It's a hit by a dart. - Who did it? A while ago Black Butterfly again showed at court. Oh, with your skill you must've arrested him. - What? You lost? - No, he ran away. - How could you let him run away? - I tried my best to chase him. But when I got to this house, he suddenly disappeared. And I saw the light is still on, I didn't expect that the master was in the house. - I thought that master is Black Butterfly. - You must be crazy. How come you don't suspect me? You can't even lift a weight, how could you be Black Butterfly? If I were Black Butterfly, you can't capture me. Forget it, bring me the medicine. I was just too careless to be hit by that bastard. You're no match for him and still scold him, next time he cuts your head off. Could you say then that you were too careless? Where's the dart? Let me take a look. - Gold Arrow. - You know who is he? Strange. Only one man in the fighter world uses this Gold Arrow. Who? Vanish without a trace, Loong Sanfong. - Definitely not him. - Do you know him, master? No, I just heard about him. He's a righteous man with perfect fighting skills. Though this Gold Arrow is only a dart but when thrown, ring like a bell. No one can escape from it, it's nearly invincible. I heard that he's killed by his enemy, he's disappeared for more than ten years. - Could he be still alive? - Master... If as you say Mr. Loong is a righteous fighter, why he'd become a bandit? Besides, what he did to you doesn't qualify him as a hero. He just disrespected you. Master, hurry up, help him to his room. We'll stay here. You want to check in for a room? Please. - Do you have a clean and tidy room? - Yes, we've a empty room, this way please. Right here. Come in please. You find the room good? Please get changed first, I'll bring you hot water and acme tea. - Lady, are you looking for Doctor Wang? - Is he here? - Yes, is Mr. Kwan getting better? - Yes, thank you. Bao Zhu. Little girl. - Uncle Wang. - Please come in and sit down. - Third brother, you like her? - This little girl is pretty. - 2 more of this medicine, he'll get better. - Yes, thank you. - Is your dad getting better? - Yes. But he can't sleep at night. - Can you please come to see him? - Ok, I'll go along with you. Thank you. - Doctor, are you going out? - I'm going to Bao Zhu's house. If there's any patient, please ask him to wait, I'll be right back. Right. Waiter, come here. You called? Who was the little girl? She's the daughter of the owner of Ten Mile Inn, the Goldword's Kwan Yee. Daughter of Goldsword's Kwan? Then she must be a skilful fighter. No, you're wrong. Mr. Kwan has many students but he never let her learn martial arts. - Sounds like you're familiar with her? - Of course, we're brought up together. - How could we be distant? - What's wrong with Mr. Kwan? It sounds funny, Mr. Kwan is seldom ill. - He's ill now is caused by Black Butterfly. - Black Butterfly? A flying bandit Black Butterfly appeared here lately, don't you know that? - A bandit? - Yes. There's been no thief or bandit in this place since Mr. Kwan lives here. Net a tiny thing had been stolen for years. But suddenly the Black Butterfly appeared, he's really something. Even Mr. Kwan wasn't able to catch him, instead he was fooled by Black Butterfly. He faced a serious failure, he's very angry and got sick. - Waiter. - Coming. I'll talk to you later. I never expected that we'd find Black Butterfly here. We'll go to visit Mr. Kwan tomorrow, Mr. Kwan, you became ill because of your frustration. - Please open your mind and you'll be better. - Thank you. Give him two more times this recipe and then he'll be fine. - Thank you, uncle Wang. - Good bye. - Remember, don't let him lose temper again. - I understand, don't worry. - Doctor Wang, how's my master? - He'll be better as soon as he calms down. It's dangerous for an old man to get sick, talk to him. - Thank you. - Good bye. - What are you doing? - Going to get the herbs. Who asked you to get the herbs? - Is what the doctor prescribed, no? - Yes, it is. I can't go myself. Hand me the prescription. - Why are you following me? - Accompanying you. Well, I grew up here, I know the address. I don't need you to come with me. - Don't go. I'll be right back. - Alright, I'll take care of the master here. I'll hit you. Master... It's you, why you're here? What's the matter? Is your dad getting batter? - Master, I wish to tell my dad the truth. - No way. If he asks who taught you the fighting skills, it'll get me involved. But he's really sick, I feel very bad. It's your fault to act like a child and make fun of your dad, Little did I expect him to fall ill because of this, No matter what, in no way you should tell him the truth. Why are you hiding your identity? What is the reason? Well, it's none of your business. Master... is your surname Loong? How do you know? I was trapped in the magistrate office that night, I couldn't get away from it. I hit Xi Lang with an arrow. My Gold arrow? Didn't I tell you not to use it? There were too many soldiers, and you won't let me kill anyone. Besides, I didn't mean to hit him. Probably because your dad saw the Gold arrow realized it was me. - You're really the Swordsman Loong. - Yes. Dad said that you're enemy wanted to kill you and you disappeared 10 years ago. - Master, I'll take revenge for you. - King Pingliang, He killed all my families when I was away. King Pingliang? With our skills, we've no fear. Silly kid, there many skilful fighters working for him. We shouldn't make any reckless move. I'll definitely take revenge but it's not yet the right time. Master, let me take revenge for you, I'll even risk my life to attain it. I got it. You leave first, don't mention anything to your dad, I'll figure it out. - I'm leaving now. - Ok. A good student. - Good. - Go. Good, Child's play. Pick up the weapons. Showy fight on stage, it's no use at all. Judging from your words you're here to make trouble. - No good is no good. - What? You are not convinced, eh? - Damn, - Little Poue, why are you fighting? - He... - Did you forget what my dad said? Keeper, our third chief is here to pay you a visit. I'm Jade Nan. How are you. Miss Kwan? - I don't know you. - Now you know me. Who are you? How you mess around here? - Whoever we are it's none of your concern. - Do you know what kind of a place it is? Isn't it Mr. Kwan's ten Mile Inn? - What? Want to kill me? - What the hell. Want to fight? Good. One on one or you guys come together. - Get away. - Little Tiger... Leave it to me. Let's go together, go. - Stop. - Brother... - Brother... - Xi Lang. - Brother, what's the matter? - I don't know where these guys come from. They're just making trouble here. This guy tried to take advantage of Bao Zhu. Brother? Then he's the best skilled. Yes, we're here to deliberately stir up trouble. No convinced? Fight with me then. I think you're here with an ulterior motive. Fine, let me fight with you. Xi Lang. Did you learn your lesson? - Third brother, you take him. - My apology. Hold it. - Dad? - Master, - What happened? - These two guys came here to make trouble. Who are you? - I'm Jade Nan, nicknamed Jade Face. - I'm Smiley Devil, Han Jie. You're from the Five Devils Rock. I run a small inn here and live a quiet life. Why are you asking for trouble here? We admire your reputation, your skill is well known. - We'd like to fight with you. - Then you really want to fight with me? Ok, both of you fight together. Come on third brother, together. I never get involved with any of fighter world's affairs. So I spare you guys this time, you better leave here now. Get up. We lost today but we'll come back someday Kwan, just wait and see. Third brother, they out-number us, let's go. - Get lost. - Go. The case of Black Butterfly must be related to them. - Get it? - Go. Sir, I've prepared the report to the royal court, kindly look at it. - Thank you. - Not at all, it's my duty. Very good, very good. - Stamp it. - Yes. The official stamp is missing, I should be punished. Stamp in 5 Devils Rock. Awaiting Goldsword's Kwan. Goldswords Kwan? What does it mean? Godfather, he's my master, Goldsword's Kwan Yee. - Where's he now? - He's in the town. - Good, please ask him to come here. - Sure. - Brother, good morning. - Brother. Is master getting better? He's been coughing the whole night, he's asleep now. Where's Bao Zhu? She didn't sleep at all last night, she's taking care of the master in his room/. What's the matter? Brother. What's happening with brother these days? He looks kind of dumb, like me. Nonsense. Stop. - Who are you? - I'm a new comer here. Stop, where you going? Stop pretending. Little brother. - Did Liu Xi Lang come by? - No, he didn't come today. - Is Mr. Kwan here? - Yes. - But he's not feeling well, still sleeping. - I'm Mr. Yu, from the Court of Censors. - I've urgent matters to see Mr. Kwan. - Ah, you're Mr. Yu, please follow me. Sure. Please wait. Master, Mr. Yu from the Court of Censors wants to see you. - Please let him in. - You may come in. - Mr. Kwan. - Have a seat. Die Xi Lang come by? No, I haven't seen him since yesterday, what's the matter? Look at this. - Five Devils Rock? - It's a serious matter. Yesterday Lord Fang asked Xi Lang to invite you to his house. But we are still waiting for him. I know his character, he must've gone to Five Devils Rock himself. That's why he probably hasn't come back. Please reply to the Lord they said they are looking for me. - I'll return the stamp to you. - Good. You tell the lord not to worry, I'm going there now. Five Devils Rock. Captain. There's a visitor at the fortress. Please wait, I'll ask the chief. Kwan Yee. Good, Kwan is here. Brothers, he shows his respect to us, we'll show our respect to him too. Please give your order chief. Align guards at the three gates to welcome him. Guards lining up. Mr. Kwan. Our chief invites you to come in. Sorry Mr. Kwan. - Mr. Kwan, please. - After you. Mr. Kwan. It's a long way to come here, will you like some tea? - Take it. - Thanks. Mr. Kwan, please. Please. Mr. Kwan, how are you? - Who are you? - I'm Red Hair Devil Ma Feilong. Mr. Kwan, you're a brave man. - Please. - After you. Then, let's go together. - Come. - After you. Come down. Mr. Kwan, nice kung-fu. Chief, are you kidding with me? - Please. - After you. - Please. - After you. Please have a seat. It's an honor to have you here. - I dare not ignore your invitation. - Good. Mr. Kwan comes here alone today, it's admirable. We ought to give you some respect. - Thank you. - Stop the nonsense, tell us what you want. For this old man's sake, please give me back the stamp and my student. Stamp? The stamp is up there, your student... - Fifth brother. - Chief? - Show Mr. Kwan the way. - Sure. Mr. Kwan, this way please. Is he your student? Right, it's him. Sit down. At. - Guards. - Sir. - Please invite Mr. Kwan's student here. - Right. We have fulfilled your needs. But we need your help for two things. - Please go ahead. - First... I want Lord Fang to give us 10,000 taels of silver... to cover for the loss caused by Black Butterfly. What? Black Butterfly stole your silver, what it have to do with Lord Fang? - Deal with Black Butterfly yourself. - Xi Lang. The skill of your student is not so good but he's rather good arguing. He's just a kid. Please forgive him, what's the second one? It's something to be happy about, I think you'll surely promise me. Please go ahead. My third brother likes your daughter very much, I want to be their matchmaker. And ask your permission for the marriage. Well. Stop babbling, look at him, he's such a smart and strong man. A handsome guy too, what's wrong with him? Mr. Kwan, your daughter met my third brother. They flirted with each other, they like each other already. Shut up. - Stop the bullshit. - Look at the hot temper of this old men. Do you realise where you are at? If I was scared, I wouldn't be here. Kwan, you don't appreciate my offer. I tell you, your daughter must marry my third brother. Are you bullying us with the number of your people? - So what? - Hold it. He's not armed here today, if we fight with him... it'd really mean we bully him. Kwan, take it or leave it. Answer my offer. Since you don't respect me. Within 3 days I'll take the stamp back in person. - What if you fail? - Then you can do whatever you want. After 3 days I'll wipe the Kiang Shan County out, killing all the people. - See the guests out. - Guests out. Master, please let me go with you. Though my skill is not good enough, I can still be of a little help. No need, wouldn't be better if you come. - Master, let me go with you too. - Master, both of us were orphans. We were raised and brought up by you. Master, please let me join you. Even if we get killed at the Rock, we'd be grateful. No way, none of you is permitted. Dad, you have to go? Kid, I know that, it's very dangerous this time. But you should be aware of my character. I seldom fail in my life, I can't take the insult this time. Besides, the people of the county are relying on me. I understand. - Master. - Dad. Listen to me, stay here. Sure the Rock is a dangerous place but I may leave there alive. If I don't come back before dawn... you take good care of Bao Zhu for me, I'll appreciate it. Xi Lang... If you don't see me at dawn, report to Lord Fang and send more soldiers... - to protect the people of the county. - I see to it. Please take care of Bao Zhu. Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as possible. Bao Zhu. Bao Zhu, Bao Zhu. What can we do? Bao Zhu, don't be sad, Master will be alright with his skills. Bao Zhu. - Don't cry. - Bao Zhu, You... Chase. Chase. - The chief is coming. - Chief... - Where is Kwan? - He was saved by Black Butterfly. They have nowhere to go, chase. Chief, got them? - We didn't see anyone. - They didn't come here. - Probably they're still inside. - They really haven't come here? No, I didn't see anyone here. - Go back and search. - Search. Thank you for saving my life, may I know your name? Hero... Though you won't ask me to pay back, I'm not an ungrateful man. Are you dumb? At least show me your face. Hero... Well, you don't take me as a friend. For saving my life, thank you and goodbye. What are you doing? You want me to go home? You don't allow me to the rock. It's important to take the stamp back, I must go. Thank you for your kindness, I must take the stamp back. They'll never expect me going back to the rock now. Please don't stop me. What do you mean? Who the hell are you? You're out of line. Hero, please forgive me but I must go to the Rock. If you insist on stopping me, I'll fight my way out. Hero... I've been in the fighter world for years, I never expect being fooled like this. You don't allow me to go to the rock If I can't get the stamp back, I'll be sorry... for my daughter and the county people. I would've no reason to live, I'll die in front of you. Dad. Dad, Five Devils Rook is full of traps, It's too dangerous, you shouldn't go there. - How come it's you? - Please forgive me. - I didn't tell you the truth. - Up, up. - Who taught you the skills? - I did. Master... - Are you Swordsman Loong? - I'm Loong Sanfong. Mr. Kwan. Bao Zhu is gifted with a rare body, perfect for learning martial arts I'd say. - Would be a pity not to developed it. - Thank you for your teaching. As for the official stamp of Lord Fang, Don't worry, I'll get it back for you. Yes. We'll discuss this matter thoroughly. It's not a good place to talk, let's go to your inn. Right. - Master. - Master. Bao Zhu. Shut up, she's here. Bao Zhu, you're Black Butterfly? - You're Black Butterfly. - Quiet, come on. - Pay your respects to Swordsman Loong. - Swordsman Loong, how are you? Fine, thanks. Call me Drunken Beggar. Bao Zhu, get the master some wine, let's drink first and discuss business later/. - Yes, master. - Let me. Mr. Kwan, have a seat. Xi Lang, you stay here and keep Swordsman Loong company. Don't dirty your clothes. No need to report to the Lord, we can handle it. Mr. Kwan, don't worry, the Rock will be wiped out definitely tomorrow. We'll get the stamp back. - Come on, let's drink. - Ok. - Come on. - I'll drink with you. Go to the second gate. - Master, let us go first. - Ok. Get away. Go. Kwan, are you here to deliver me a wife? - What nonsense. - Attack. Oh, it's you. - Master, let us go first. - Go. Go. Get away. Go. Hold it. You dare to attack our stronghold, probably you don't want to live. Gai Tian Lui. Give me the stamp, surrender and you'll be spared. Kwan Yee... If you can take my Gold Coin Darts, I'll give you the stamp. Gai, it doesn't need Mr. Kwan to take your darts. I, the Drunker Beggar, may take them. - Who are you? - I've no name. Call me Drunken Beggar. I want to have a good time here. Stop bluffing. No more? - Mr. Kwan, come on, fight. - Go. Get away. Dad, hold it, let me get it. - Master. - Master. The bandits outside either dead or surrender, they're all tied up. It's cool. This is Lord Fang's stuff, take it. Dear King Pingliang... With your offer of 3000 tales of gold, we're well prepared... within a month we'll take Kiang Shan County as a base... and head north. Please accept the stamp of your enemy Lord Fang as an evidence. Leave it to me. I'll deal with it. Swordsman Loong, this time I come with my godfather, we're helping victims as a front. Actually we're looking evidence of King Pingliang's rebellion. I have the evidence now. Swordsman Loong. What should we do with this fortress? We shouldn't spare this kind of harmful place, burn it. - Right. Guys, bum the place. - Sure. Mr. Liu, take them back to Kiang Shan County. Sure, take them back to the county.
