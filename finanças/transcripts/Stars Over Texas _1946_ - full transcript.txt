Good idea. Not me-- water rots my stomach. Say, Eddie, where'd you learn to sing? Oh, I don't know, just picked it up somewhere. With my looks and his voice, I'd have all the girls in Texas waving at me. Yeah, you sure would-- like this. No, like this, soapy. Hey, Eddie, there goes a calf down in-down in-down-- in the ditch. And little calves can't get out of the ditch by itself. Little calves make good eatin' for mountain lions. I'll get him. You boys stay with the herd. ( Moo ) Go on, baby, up! Up! Come on! Git up! Come on! Come on, get up there! Oh, boy. Come on, boy he's all in. And so are you. Yeah. I brought his mother over so she could see how we took care of her baby. Good old soapy--always in the deal for the ace play. No, it's just his mother instinct. Instinct is right-- with the accent on the last syllable. Ha ha-- ha ha! We've got to get moving if we expect to close the deal on the herd at the bar-l ranch. There they are. The one with his hat off is Hank Lawrence. The other one's his foreman, Burt Ford. That's the one we want. We're in luck-- we won't have to go all the way to bar-l ranch to get our man. After 'em! Let's head for town! They've gotten away-- we'll never catch 'em now. Think they got a good look at US? No, not the way they were makin' tracks. Let's split up and get back into town. ( Cattle mooing ) Cowboys: Heeyah! Heeyah! Hey, ace. You and the boys will be needed by Mr. Lawrence to look after the stock, so you'll stay here at the bar-l. Your bunk's just in back of the ranch. Thanks, Eddie. So long, boys. You and soapy get on into El Paso and find US a place to bed down before dark. I'll stay here and close the deal on our stock and meet you at the Spanish kitchen. Oh, boy. I haven't had any Spanish cooking in a long time. Hey, waco-- you may know your gals, but I sure know my Spanish d-d-d-dishes. I know some pretty good Spanish dishes myself. Now, let's see, there was Maria, Rosa, and, um... Braggin' again, huh? Why not? Come on fellas, break it up, get goin'. Hey, open up in there, you old hoss fly. Come on, you old cow thief--open up! Whom do you wish to see? I'm Eddie Dean. I just drove that herd of cattle down for Mr. Lawrence-- where is he, doesn't he live here anymore? He lives here, but he's not in right now. I'm Hank Lawrence's sister. But I've been expecting you. I'm going to handle the transaction on the deal. That's good enough for me. I have my bill of sale right here. But first, I'd like to take a look at the stock, if you don't mind. Certainly not. I didn't know Hank had a sister. Well, I've been away at school, only coming home for the summers. But since mom and dad passed away, I decided I'd better stay here and help Hank run the ranch. You, uh, were studying home care, I suppose. No, high finance. Oh, uh, here's your bill of sale for the cattle. I hope I didn't make any mistakes on the figures. No, you didn't. Well, here's your check. Thanks. Oh, miss Lawrence. Has Hank figured out why the cattle thieves have selected only his ranch to raid? No... It's still as much of a mystery as ever. Since he's had Burt Ford as foreman, whoever it is has been taking potshots at him. Sounds kinda bad. I'll say. We've given Mr. Ford a free hand in running everything, and he was doing so well until lately. But it's getting so dangerous, he dare not be on the range alone. I'd like to have a talk with him-- can you tell me where I can find him? He and my brother went down on the lower range, but I think they might be going into town tonight. Perhaps you could find them at the Spanish kitchen. Thanks. Well, I hope nothing happens to Burt... I mean, Mr. Ford. I, uh, see what you mean. According to my contract with the government, I'm behind schedule delivering my cattle. Yeah, that last herd that disappeared on you put you in a tough spot. I'll say it did. I stand to lost the contract. With no sheriff in this town, who can we report this to? Nobody--you know this town as well as I do, you know it's wide open. I have a mind to take the bull by the horns and handle this myself. Can't afford to take the chance, if you get killed, it'll be too late for them to prove anything. I hadn't thought of that. No more. I got here as quick as I could, and boy, am I hungry. What are you gonna have? Maybe a little of what they got--looks good. It is good, too. Well, partners, looks like we've got more on our hands than we bargained for. Yeah, how come? We're not only looking for cattle thieves now, we're looking for killers. Uh-oh. If they find out that you're investigating for the cattlemen's association, you'll be the person that they'll k-k-k-k- knock off. If you'll oblige me by keeping your big mouth full of chili instead of words of wisdom. Ha ha! What's the matter, Eddie? You look sick. I was sick for a second. What's the matter with me? Am I seeing double? Look. Hey, am I feeding the wrong face? I never saw two faces look so much alike in my life! Burt, there's Eddie Dean over there. I guess he delivered that new batch of cattle. Hi, Eddie. It's Hank Lawrence. Come on. Hello, you old horse thief. I got something I want to talk to you about. Sure. That's Burt Ford, my foreman. Hello, Burt. Glad to meet you. This is soapy Jones, and waco Harper. I can't get over how much we look alike. Yeah, neither can I. Well, they say everybody's got a perfect double. I guess this is one time they just happened to meet up. What's on your mind, Eddie? I heard about the trouble you've been having. Seeing these two together gave me a great idea. Let's have it. With waco just arriving in town, no one else but US realizes their close resemblance. That's right... I'm beginning to see the light. We'll have waco pose as my foreman, Burt. Wait a minute! Don't I have anything to say about this? Let me see if i'm getting this straight. You want me to take his place as foreman of his ranch and be him? You catch on pretty fast. I can't understand why. He's the one somebody's trying to kill. Oh, I knew there was a reason in it--nothin' doin'. Whew, I'm sure glad I don't look like him. Come on, waco, as a special favor for me. Unh-unh. Not as a special favor for my own mother. You still want to learn the cattle business, don't you? Not now. Then you'd better get riding. I'm gonna stick around town and I don't want this case complicated. You'll be well-rewarded. The ranch will be at your disposal. You'll live like a king for as long as the job last. All right, fellas, I'll do it. But mind you, it ain't the money that's in it. Fine. Well, knuckles, mugsy tells me you missed again. I'm sorry, boss, Ford seems to have a charmed life. You've certainly delayed things. You're supposed to be good with your guns, but with all the help you've given me, I'd be just as well off if you were back in the pen. With Ford around, I don't dare touch another head of cattle on the bar-l ranch. There was many a head in the last bunch we got you. Yes, I know, but he's already got a new herd moving in to replace it. We've gotta work fast. If Lawrence loses his contract, with the stock that I've got in hand, we stand next in line for it. But our hands are tied unless we get rid of Ford. If he'd shoot it out with US, I could get him, but we always high-tails it. He's yellow, all right, or else he'd blab all he knows about US. That's why we've got to stop him before he does. ( Knocking ) Come in. One of the boys just seen Burt Ford eating over at the Spanish kitchen. So, he finally ventured into town. Knuckles, here's that chance to prove your reputation. I won't miss this time, Ringo. Come on. I feel pretty duded up. Mr. Ford sure got mighty fine taste. You shoulda seen him dressed up in your clothes. He sure looked trampy. Ford went out the back way. He's gonna stay hid out at ma tompkin's place. Remember, you're Burt Ford, understand? Yeah, but his boots are a little snug, they kinda hurt. ( Screaming ) Why, you dirty skunk! You're wasting your time going out there-- it's a cinch whoever it is, they've gotten away. The man we're after are more clever than you think. Let's give 'em a little time, they'll show their hand. In view of what happened here, I don't think it's a good idea for US to go back to the ranch tonight. We can stay at the oasis hotel. Good. Well, well, look what just blew into town. Old pots and pans himself. Ha ha! Hello, pots and pans. Say, step right up, I got everything from imported shaving mugs to firecrackers. Yes, sir. Ha ha ha! You just have your fun, fellas, that'll cost ya, that's all. Oh, sure just put it on our bill. Let's see how you look in this, mugsy. That oughta just fit you. Ha ha ha! Let's see ya! Gentlemen, please, that was my very best wig. That's gonna make some bald head very happy. But it makes me very happy to see it on mugsy. Mugsy, you don't know how good you look in that. Ha ha ha! That's my most expensive wig! What's this thing? That's rare, rare China, very rare China. Oh, now, ain't that too bad? Eddie: That's something you're going to have to pay for. How much does he owe you, including that? That's $40 for the wig, $15 for the China piece-- $55 in all. Oh, and twenty-five cents for the balloon, they popped that, too. Pay up. I don't know who you are, but you're askin' for trouble. Waco: Hold it. Get their guns, soapy. That fight's between those two-- I'm keeping it that way. Thanks, partner. Would you like to make a little bet on the side? How much did you say they owed you? $55.25. That vase was real China. You heard what the man said. That's something I never could stand for-- someone destroying something that doesn't belong to 'em. Come on, let's get out to the ranch. Gee, I wonder who that fella is, he's plenty tough. Yeah. If Ringo thinks Burt Ford is yella, he must be color-blind. Soapy: He, you fellas. If you want your guns, you'll have to fish for 'em. Hey, wait a minute. You didn't give me my twenty-five cents. Oh, shut up. Waco, you've been all over the property now. In case anyone asks you, you were born in Dallas and have been ranching most of your life. In the last five years, you've put at least five ranches back on their feet. You've got to feel important and look important. Now why don't you ask him something he can do? There's only one thing we got to worry about. Don't get too close to miss Lawrence, Hank's sister. And she's the only one that might get suspicious. Oh, women. Oh, I can handle any of 'em, don't worry about that. Yeah, that's what bothers me. And remember your name is Burt and not waco. You've got to look this place over and try and get familiar with things. You'll sleep in the back bedroom in the main ranch house. Come on, Eddie, soapy, I'll show you the bunkhouse where you'll sleep. Unh! Whew! Burt! You old darling, where have you been? I've been so worried about you. I guess I was in town. Well, don't you know? Why, why, yes, I was in town. What have I got to do to get you to kiss me, hit you over the head? After all, we're practically engaged, aren't we? Why, why sure-- sure we are. Don't you think I'd better put my boots on first? Why, Burt Ford! You weren't trying to sneak in here, were you? Oh, no, it isn't that, I just don't feel right kissing a girl without my boots on. Have you been drinking? Oh, no, no, i-- I just don't feel well. I know just the thing for that. Yeah, what? I'm going to fix you a nice big dose of castor oil. ( Coughs ) So you're the man who really knows women. Shut up, will ya? Where's the bunkhouse-- I'm stayin' with you fellas. Follow me. I'm sleepin' over there. And don't ask him why he don't like the ranch house. Well, suit yourself-- Burt. Now that you men are staying here, the gang's planning a little get-together for you tonight. Fine, we'll be there. That's for me! I haven't b-b-b-b-bumped hips in a long time. Yee hoo! ( All chatting ) I tell ya, Texas is not the biggest state. When Texas was admitted to the union, they made the rio grande the border line, didn't they? Right. Will it takes 15 days to get across Texas to the rio grande, don't it? And it takes 15 days to get to Texas, don't it? Well, that makes Texas just one half as big as the whole United States. Wait a minute, soapy. I agree with you, Texas is a big state, but it's not quite that big. You see, I looked it up once. Yeah? Yeah, I wrote a song about it. Sho' nuff? Um-hmm. How did it go? Put down those cups, boys, and let's tell him. ( Playing uptempo tune ) * there are fifteen hundred and one miles of heaven * * up and down and across Texas land * * just north of the rio grande * where you always get a welcome hand * * south of Oklahoma, west of Louisiana * * east of beautiful new Mexico * * seven hundred thirty-seven * and seven sixty-four * add these miles together * than you won't need any more * for there's fifteen hundred and one miles of heaven * * up and down and across Texas land * ( fiddle solo ) ( Accordion solo ) ( Guitar solo ) * there are fifteen hundred and one miles of heaven * * where the soft prairie breezes blow * * and the cool, clear water's low * * by the fields where the white cotton grows * * where the stars shine brighter * * and your burdens are lighter * at the end of a long, long day * * seven hundred thirty-seven * and seven sixty-four * gonna close the gate behind me * * 'cause my roamin' days are o'er * * for there's fifteen hundred and one miles of heaven * * up and down and across Texas land ** You know, this is some of the best grazin' land in the country, and I can understand why somebody'd like to take it over, and why they'd like to steal the cattle. But for the life of me, I can't understand why they're so dead set on gettin' rid of that foreman. Far as I can see, the cattleman's association hired you to track down stolen cattle. Ain't nobody hiring you to track down killers. Why don't you stick to your first job? I think they both lead up the same road. How do you figure that? Whoever stole the last herd from this ranch is the same person or persons who are trying to kill Burt Ford. Why? I don't get it. Probably because he knows something. I'm glad it's him that knows something instead of me. This is one time that it pays to be dumb. Ha ha! I'm gonna ride over on the south range, see what I can find out. If I'm gone more than an hour, start lookin'. Meantime, watch over waco and see that he doesn't say the wrong thing. See that he doesn't say the wrong thing? Who's gonna watch me to see that I don't say the wrong thing? You're gettin' smarter every day, soapy. Good luck. Knuckles: I knew we'd run into one of 'em if we waited long enough. That's the hombre that gave you that workin' over. Here's where he gets paid back. There he is now! I think you got him. Hello, flash, what are you doing here? ( Whistles ) ( Whistles ) Hey, Eddie, what are you doing down there? I guarantee I wasn't down there because I needed a bath. This is a funny place to jump off of. Sometimes a dangerous jump leads a man to safety. Yeah. Especially if he's running away from rattlesnakes. What happened? Some fellas took a shot at me. Let's get to our horses. Did you get a good look at 'em? No, they were too far away. Yeah? One of 'em was wearin' silver spurs. Well, how do you like that? We better report this to Ringo. ( Knocking ) Is that you, ma tompkins? Man: No, it's me, Patrick. Open up. What for? I've got somethin' I want to show you. You won't be sorry. Could I interest you in some rare imported knick-knacks? Oh, it's you. I'm might glad to see you again. Again? Have we met before? Don't you remember? I'm the one you and your pals made them rowdies pay off to the other day. Rowdies? Oh--oh, yes. Think nothing of it. Well, that's a favor I'll never forget. If you hadn't showed up, no tellin' what they would have done. They was plenty tough, too. Just to show my appreciation, I got a nice present for you. Please, Mr. Tucker-- some other time. There's on time like the present. What in the world are you doing with all that stuff? Well, I'm salesman, and this is some of my wares. Here it is, yes. A nice solid silver belt buckle-- do ya like it? Oh, yes. That's nice-looking. It's all yours, too. Oh, no, that's too much for me. Nothin's too much for you, not after what you done for me. All right, if you insist, but I don't feel quite right in taking it. Oh, I see you have a firecracker, too. Oh, yes, I wouldn't be without my firecracker line. You never can tell when I'm going to run into a celebration or a wedding or an election or even a revolution. This is one commodity I don't have any trouble sellin'. You take this here big one-- it's dynamite-- let me show you. I wish you wouldn't have done that. Well, it didn't go off, anyway. Whew. ( Loud explosion ) Burt, this is two horn, Hank just hired him. This is Burt Ford, our foreman. Howdy. Glad to know you. We can always use a good hand around here. You can make yourself at home over in the bunkhouse, two horn. Yes, ma'am. Well, I better get busy, I've got two more saddles to put into shape. Oh, Burt, you're acting so strangely. As though you're trying to avoid me. Is there anything wrong? Oh, no, nothing. But I've got a confession to make to you. What? Excuse me, I've got to see soapy about something important. So you're the one that's so bright with women. Why, you're scared stiff. A fool as ugly as I am, I could do better myself. You're all talk and no gumption. You would have spilled the whole bag of beans if I hadn't caught you. Look, soapy, I don't mind being shot at, I don't mind being walked on or bawled out or even bein' razzed by you. But when I went into this deal, I didn't take on no deal of lovemakin'. And, well, I have to admit to you on the quiet that I ain't as much with the ladies as I told you I was. Do you know what a wolf is? Uh-huh. Well, you're a sheep. And in sheep's clothing, too. Well, looks like I'm going to have to let you in on a secret. Is it about Burt? Yes, it is. Don't worry, I know all about it. He isn't Burt. But where is Burt Ford? I'm worried about him. I can't tell anyone where he is right now, not even you. That's the only way we can keep him safe. Just trust me, and please, don't let this Burt know that you know that he isn't your first Burt. Don't worry, that would spoil my fun. This Burt has a way with him. Will you never settle down to just one Beau? Oh, I will-- when the right one comes along. I think this belongs to you. Yeah, that's off of my spurs. Then that makes you one of the hombres that tried to get me on the hill, and that makes you owe me an explanation. Stay where you are, unless you want to be filled full of lead. All right, bright eyes, who's head of your rotten outfit? So you won't talk, eh? I know of a nice quiet jail built for people just like you. They got two horn-- he's in jail. But how could that happen? That stranger who rode into town and picked on knuckles has taken over the jail. He told the jailer as long as there's no law here he's take charge until the circuit judge arrives. Oh, he did? I don't suppose he knows that I run this town. I don't think so, boss. Well, seeing as he's going to wait until the judge arrives, he's given me a few ideas. Yeah? Yeah, we'll send for our own judge immediately. Let me see, old diamond Smith oughta make a good judge. Send one of the boys for him right away. And just before he's due to arrive, we'll run a few of my cattle into the bar-l's corral, and let the law take care of the rest. * on the sands of the old rio grande * * where I stroll with my love * * hand in hand * 'neath the cottonwood tree * where she whispers to me * little words that are still in my memory * * as I sit by the old rio grande * * I write her dear name in the sand * * and I pray while on your way * * you'll bring her back some day * * to the sands of the old rio grande * * dear old river * I know you're my friend * on you, and you alone * I depend * to carry my plea * on your way to the sea * when she hears I'm alone * she will come back to me * and I'll hold her in my arms * * once again * where we'll plan our little home * * on the sand * in the moon's soft, silvery light * * we'll stroll here every night * * on the sands on the old rio grande ** You were so quiet, I didn't hear you come up. I didn't want you to stop singing. Stop singing? Outside of flash, I didn't think anyone liked my singing. Hank told me I'd find you here. I heard you had a little trouble. Oh, it wasn't much, but I think it'll help US work things out. Whoever it is isn't satisfied with trying to kill Burt and steal all our cattle, now they're after anyone who tries to help US. Yes, seems that way. It's certainly nice of you and your friends to fight for people that mean nothing to you. I wouldn't say exactly that. Hank told me where Burt was hiding out. You think it would be save for me to go see him? No, you stay away from there. Well, if you see him, would you tell him that i-- yeah, sure, Terry-- I understand. I'll tell him. ( Cattle mooing ) We better high-tail it back to the hideout. Judge Smith's posse'll be waiting for US there. Come on, judge, we'll show you where we've hidden the cattle so they won't have a chance to get rid of 'em before you've made your arrests. Hank Lawrence? That's me. I'm the new circuit judge, and I'm placin' you under arrest. But what for? Stealin' cattle. Eddie: I'm sure glad you arrived, judge, i-- and I'm arrestin' everybody else on this ranch as his accomplices. What's your proof? I just saw with my own eyes some cattle with Ringo Evans' brand of the cross-e on 'em in Lawrence's south corral. That's enough for me. I'm heading for town to get Burt-- maybe he can explain things to the judge. Good. Get that girl and bring her back. Disarm these men. We'll see that they get a quick trial. I guess you men know the penalty for stealing cattle. Hold on there, judge. We're not paying the penalty for something we didn't do, without a chance to explain. Keep me covered till I get out of sight. With pleasure. And I'm going with him--nyeah! ( Fires gun ) ( Knocking ) Terry: Burt! Let me in, quick! Is something wrong? I'll say. The circuit judge has just arrested Eddie and Hank and the fellow that's posing as you. He said that they stole come of Ringo's cattle! So Ringo's still up to his dirty work, huh? And there's going to be some hangings if you don't tell what you know. That wouldn't do any good-- I don't have any proof. But don't worry-- we'll figure something out. If you're looking for two horn, you can stop here. Where is he? Mr. Evans and that new judge came in and released him. Much obliged. We're in luck. How do you figure that? Nobody home. Eddie said to keep 'em covered till he got out of sight. We're doin' better than that-- we're keepin' 'em covered till he gets back. That's a good idea, seein' as how it's either our necks or theirs. It appears the judge has run into a little snag. Yeah. Drop those guns. Your arrival is very timely, Mr. Evans. Now there's more charges against you-- resisting arrest and menacing a government representative for his very life. Wait a minute, judge, he don't mean nothin', he's an impostor-- two horn told me all about it. Mugsy, keep these men covered until we get back. Ford's the man we want, and he's somewhere in town. Judge, you and your men come with me. Take a look at this. Yeah. Did you ever see a branding iron like this before? Funniest-looking brand I ever saw. Let's see... Looks like Chinese to me. Yeah. Now, the bar-l is the known brand of the Lawrence's. And the cross-e is the known brand of Ringo Evans. I wonder what this brand has to do with. Say, that's perfect. Yeah. Maybe this'll help influence the judge. Let's get over to Burt Ford-- he'll be interested in this, too. What did Ringo ever have on you that you couldn't expose him? I ran into him one night with a band of stolen cattle. He warned me if I ever told anyone, he'd get even with you and Hank, steal all your stock and eventually take all your government contracts. To protect you, I've been trying to get proof, so that when he did speak, I'd have something to back me up. You see, without proof it'd be his word against mine, and you know how powerful he is. ( Knocking ) Eddie: Burt, it's Eddie, let me in. Here's something interesting I found over in Evans' office. It's evidence that he's responsible for the missing stock. He's stealing the cattle and changing Lawrence's brand over to his own. That's all the evidence we need. Soapy: Some men's been watching this place. Evidently hirelings of Ringo Evans. We'll stay under cover here till that judge arrives. With our evidence, he and his men haven't got a chance. Well, you won't have to wait long. Terry: There's sure plenty of 'em. I don't see the judge. It isn't judge Crawford, it's a new one. He's the one over there with Evans. He isn't any more a judge than I am. You're being kidded-- that's diamond Smith. His reputation goes all the way back to Chicago. All right, Ford, you and the others have three minutes to come out with your hands up. I'll give you a little while to show your hand, Evans. But it ought to be a matter of hours before you're behind bars. Call of your men and give up peaceably. They're askin' for it. Burt, cover the back door. I'll go with him. Fine. There's too many of 'em, and we're short on ammunition. Make every shot count. Good, I never hit anything. What's all the shooting about? If it's a celebration, maybe I can sell some of these firecrackers. They're sold, partner-- you've given me an idea. We'll rush 'em. What the Sam hill was that? They're throwing dynamite sticks at US. Keep that up as long as you can. We'd better get 'em before they blow up the town. Oh! These Roman candles will give 'em a real celebration! Drop it. You coulda saved yourself a lot of trouble. Now call your men off. Come on, soapy, we still got some more work to do. I want to thank you for clearing this case up. The government's just renewed my contract for another three years. It all comes under the heading of another job to do. I know, you represent the cattlemen's association. But you seemed to take such a personal interest in this case. Now that I'm back as foreman of the ranch, how do I stand with you, Terry? Burt, I'll always be very fond of you, and I think waco's might nice, too. But I just can't seem to make up my mind. I can't blame you, ma'am. I guess there's just one too many of them. You, waco and soapy have made yourselves pretty valuable around here. I don't know what I'm gonna do without you. That's right--we do need a good cattleman. Would you consider going to work for US? Sure, I'll consider it. But mind you, it's just because I love ranching. * there's a lone star that's shinin' * * o'er the glory of Texas * from the red river * to the rio grande * where the cool, clear water's still ** Captioned by captioneering your closed captioning resource
