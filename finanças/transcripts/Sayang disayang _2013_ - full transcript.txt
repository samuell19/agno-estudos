MY BELOVED DEAREST If you have a wife Don't let her wear a miniskirt It's the nature of men To take a look at such thing Advanced in years But young at heart Were they to see such a thing It would turn grandpas into babies Don't you dare to wink If you love your grandchildren Don't you dare to laugh Alas, you already have dentures Don't you meddle with love Those bones are already old Don't you meddle with love You will make your grandchildren laugh Hey, Grandpa! Yes, my grandchild! Yes, my grandchild! Is that true or not? Well, that's a tough one I will heed my grandchild's advice Hey, Grandpa! Yes, my grandchild! Yes, my grandchild! Is that true or not? Yes, it's true! Yes, it's true! I will heed my grandchild's advice Hey! Too noisy! Such a ruckus! If you cooked well, it wouldn't matter much. But you're a useless hick! Hey! Just go back to Aceh and learn to cook again! You're just making noise. Your cooking is flavorless. Bland like death! If it were tasty, I wouldn't be so pissed off! Let us arrange The lotuses Oh, the sacred lotuses Adornment for the hair Of the young Oh, the young princesses How come other country folk cook well? Which forgotten tribe do you come from? If you're going to cook sambal goreng, make it properly! Is prawn paste so expensive that you can only afford to use a little? If you've run out of salt, go to the beach at nearby Pasir Ris and dry up some seawater to make salt! Give it up, you bimbo! Now is not the time To ponder Oh, not the time to ponder Let's come together and pick the flowers If I could walk on my own, I wouldn't need you. Can't you earn your keep? My son is wasting money paying you. I'd be happy to do my own cooking! Why are you pondering? Oh, my dear So lost in thought Don't you fall prey To the temptation of lust Now is not the time To ponder Oh, not the time to ponder Let's come together And pick the flowers The wind blows A branch breaks, landing on stones In a graveyard A startled magpie chirps on and on Clouds cover darkened skies A sign that rain will come Pouring down on the earth Oh, my beloved dearest Throwing it away? Such a waste. Your boss is very fussy. I pity you, Murni. You'll have to return to the village in four months. There must be something that can be done! Yet not forgotten in memories People say that the door to a man's heart is through his stomach. But for almost two years, your cooking has yet to move him. Like a ship with no destination What a shame! Oh, my beloved dearest It's a pity that you've yet to win over your boss' heart. Murni, you hear me, don't you? FROM MOKHSIN ADMADJA 3 TANGKAL STREET, BANDA ACEH You're home! Any mail for me? None, sir. Only for me. Not even mail from Rosli? None, sir. Only for me. From Australia! There is no mail for you from anyone or anywhere, sir. Are stamps so expensive? If it's too much of a bother to write, just use the phone! It's simple, no? With your high salary, surely you can afford to buy stamps or pay a phone bill! I spent thousands on your education. This is how you say thank you? Blessed son! You got with a white Australian and forgot your family. You left me here all alone. It's a sure sign that I'll have no grandchildren. I'd rather stay in an old folks' home. Might as well die penniless! -Peace be upon you. -May peace be upon you. I am calling from Masjid Jamae. May I speak to Haji... Master Haji Harun? Haji Harun speaking. How can I help you, son? How do you do, Haji Harun, sir? I'm conveying a message from the mosque's management committee. We're organizing our annual general meeting. We'd like to extend an invitation to you for this event. Praise be to God! When is this meeting to be held? It will be the end of the month, Uncle... Mr. Haji, sir. If it is God's will. May He bless me with long life so that I'm able to attend. God willing! Thank you, Mr. Haji. Please don't forget, Mr. Haji. All of us at the mosque miss you. Oh, do you? How kind. So, who will be coming to fetch me? If you're coming from home, there'll be nobody to fetch you, Mr. Haji. You can make your own way here all right? If necessary, we can reimburse your transportation expenses. Mr. Haji? Hello. Good afternoon, sir. Yes, I'm calling from Singapore. May I speak to Mokhsin? Mokhsin Admadja. Yes, he's my nephew. Sure, I'll hold. Hello, my dear. This is your aunt. Yes, in Singapore. Have you already forgotten the sound of my voice? How are you? Yes. Your birthday party? I would have loved to be there, but... When did you return? They're rebuilding the village already? That's great! Mokhsin. I need to go now, I have work to do. When I get a chance, I'll call you again, all right? Okay. Goodbye, love. Thank you, sir, for attending our meeting and sharing your views. As newbies here, we're grateful you came to share your expertise with us. Did you enjoy traveling with your wheels? Hey, how could you say that? I really must thank you once again. You attended our AGMs without fail, even before your retirement. Thank you. Only God can repay your kindness. All right, thank you all for your company. -Of course. -You're welcome, Mr. Haji. How many grandchildren do you have now? None. No grandchildren yet. Rosli doesn't have children. Now, Rosli is a busy man. He's an engineer! The situation is different there. Haji, I apologize for what happened earlier. I told them not to use this mic again. But they're stubborn. And when it acts up, I take the blame. But I'm not the technician. I appreciate your understanding, Haji. Okay, I have to get rid of this old mic now. Thank you, Haji. Move aside. Make way. -Have a safe journey, Haji! -All right. -Peace be upon you. -May peace be upon you. Come, darling Come, let's play jump rope Hold that end I'll hold this end Swing, darling, swing Don't let go I will jump So don't let me fall My wide-eyed darling If I could send you back today, this very day, I'd send you back! Singing and dancing Hey! I'm furious! Hey! Go back to your village and learn to cook! You're pulling at my heartstrings Laughing on and on Her heart is full of glee Come, darling Come, let's play jump rope Hold that end I'll hold this end Swing, darling, swing Don't let go I will jump So don't let me fall My wide-eyed darling Hold the end of the rope Dancing and singing Her heart is full of glee My wide-eyed darling You're pulling at my heartstrings Laughing on and on Her heart is full of glee Sir. Let's change your diaper first. Dinner's ready. You can eat when we're finished. I have two months' worth of work to catch up on. The agency's sending someone over first thing in the morning tomorrow. I can't get through to him anyway. I didn't even have a chance to see Mom... because of you. What's the point of having such a big Mercedes? A display of wealth? If you didn't feel like driving, you could have taken a taxi. You're so stubborn. You knew you weren't well, yet you rode the scooter anyway. Why were you so careless with Mom? My heart yearns for The one who's long gone Yet not forgotten In our memories Oh, my beloved dearest My thoughts Hey, you should be using that. This is Singapore, not Aceh. Typical hick. Shameless Acehnese. I can do whatever I please. It feels like I'm working in my own home. It's been one week so far. Fair enough. But when you do your own chores, you don't get paid for it. This big house has got the works. But it feels far too quiet. Here it is This is the jali-jali The song is delightful How sweet its melody is What's a bit of weariness, really My dear As long, sir As you're filled with glee The prawn mangoes are the most luscious Tall are the trees Its fruit sparse at best Most joyous Are the ones who are single, my dear Toing and froing At no one's command Mountains to the right And mountains to the left Between them Lies the jasmine sweet You're befuddled Just like me That makes two of us Both our hearts are in need Get us some jali-jali from Cikini, dear Get us some jali-jali Then shall I leave thee Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, Murni? It's Rosli. Yes, Murni here. How are you, Mr. Rosli? Forgive me for picking up late. I don't know which button to press. No problem, Murni. I expected you to be busy. How's my father? Mr. Harun? He's recovering, thank God. He can already move his right arm. Wow, that's good! How's his appetite? Oh, that's improving, too. When I started working five months ago, he'd eat two spoonfuls of rice. Now he finishes a whole plateful! I also tried to cook sambal goreng to entice him. You said he likes sambal goreng, didn't you? Yes, that's right! My late mother liked to cook sambal goreng for him. But he didn't eat it, sir. He really seems to hate the dish when I cook it. Perhaps it's because I haven't made it in a while. Maybe it doesn't taste good. How are you, then? Any news from Australia? Oh, everything is good. But I'm too busy to do my own cooking. When will you be back in Singapore on holidays? You must be homesick. My work here is never finished. When things slow down, I'll visit Singapore. I can't talk for much longer, Murni. Lots of work to do. Take care of the house, all right? Dad. You have to eat well to make a speedy recovery! Okay. Thank you, Murni. Bye. When I can, I will call again. Thank you, too, sir. Bye. When my heart is yearning To whom shall I return? For my heart keeps wondering And tears flow from my eyes I'm going to look for... I can't imagine living out my last days alone. To the end of the world Money is important... but what good is wealth without love? For you have forgotten your promise So I'm rotting here on my own Yearning, how my heart is yearning It's unbearable You've left me all alone To win over the one being cooked for... depends not on the taste of the food... but on the sincerity of the cook. And which type are you cooking? A regular sambal goreng or one for a bride? It's unbearable I can't wait to taste your bridal sambal goreng! Delicious! Hey! What have you served me? It's completely flavorless! Remind me why I hired a cook? She might be from the countryside, but her sambal goreng tastes so bland! Mr. Harun? What's wrong? Enough! I've lost my appetite! From which village did your son find this maid, dear? No one cooks like you, Minah. I miss your sambal goreng so much. Mr. Harun, dinner is ready. There. Please eat, Mr. Harun. It's your usual meal. It's lightly drizzling The teri fish have been salted Girl, why do you keep crying? What's gone should be forgotten Hey, boy Hey, boy Cheer up my lonely heart Please don't tease me Or my heart will be saddened Hey, girl, come here Sing together with me If I were ever to tease you Just give me a smack on the head Going to Ciamis by car It's possible by horse, too My sweet Murni, please have a laugh If you don't want to laugh, then allow me Dear Harun Dear Harun Cheer up my lonely heart Please don't tease me Or my heart will be saddened Singing and dancing To distract from the sorrow Let's have a laugh While awaiting a lover A kiss on the cheek So he'll smile again When the heart is broken Siti, how do you mend it? There's no turning back Let him suffer on his own Murni, who are you singing with? Young ladies should never sing in the kitchen. It's a sign that you'll marry an old man! Murni... will you join me? If you have a wife Don't let her wear a miniskirt It's the nature of men To take a look at such thing Advanced in years But young at heart Were they to see such a thing It would turn grandpas into babies Don't you dare to wink If you love your grandchildren Don't you dare to laugh Alas, you already have dentures Don't you meddle with love Those bones are already old Don't you meddle with love You will make your grandchildren laugh Hey, Grandpa! Yes, my grandchild! Yes, my grandchild! Is that true or not? Well, that's a tough one I will heed my grandchild's advice Hey, Grandpa! Yes, my grandchild! Yes, my grandchild! Is that true or not? Yes, it's true! Yes, it's true! I will heed my grandchild's advice Don't play with fire Or you might get burned Don't play with fire If it burns, it'll burn badly Don't meddle with love If you're not mature enough Don't meddle with love If it hurts, it'll hurt badly
