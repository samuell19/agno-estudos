Translation: neet21 [these subtitles may contain inaccuracies and grammar mistakes] Don't you have a mouth? What kind of second-hand store is this? It's all cheap junk. Who do you think you are? Who allowed you to sell things here? You're such an idiot. I got it. I got it! What do you mean? Get up, you piece of shit. You smell different from others. What are you doing? Please stop it. Don't touch my son. You've got to be kidding me. The victim of the kidnapping, Ms. Hitomi was killed this evening at Sukarno-Hatta International Airport, Indonesia. With her husband Charles Jenkins, the eldest daughter, Mika, second daughter... Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me! Excuse me! What's wrong, brother? I'm sorry, h-help ... Help us. What's going on? That bastard. Is she okay? I'll go check it out. Your shoes are so dirty. You are all beaten up. You two better not make too much of a fuss. It's going to be a problem when the police come. Why do I have to pretend I didn't see it. Let me handle this, just leave them alone. I'm not just gonna let her go. You understand, don't you, miss? Right? I'm okay. I'm sorry I worry you. There are ices in the tent over there. Just say Mrs. Fujiki sent you to get it. Your mother's face needs to be cooled down immediately. Poor thing, he can't talk? But he did talk to us just now. I'm so sorry. He came to Japan when he was seven years old. So, you two have been together. Yes. Would you like to join us for dinner? I've had bad luck with pachinko lately. Never mind. Ah yes, Mr. Fujiki said he'd help you find a job. Do you want to ask for a favor? Or is it better to be with your mom? That's okay. Okay what? I'm going to ask for a favor. See you tomorrow. Yoko! What happened to your face? Got beaten up. Who did it? It hurts. Next time I'll beat the shit out of him. We have computers but we only play card games. A non-girl duo. We're a non-girl duo that occasionally triples up on double hits. A non-girl duo. We're about to enter the skit. Ai, you can't take it. What does it matter? Just one. Mom, did Aika go to your place? Ai? She didn't come. Do you want her to come over? I see. Sorry. What's going on? She's not back yet. She's not back yet? It's already 6 pm. Aika? Hello, Miyuki? I think she left school with Mugi. They back home together and split up at Y-road. Y-road? When was it? At 3 o'clock. I'm sorry. I think she might be at Rina's house. I'm going over there now. Ai? Ah, it's you. Why so early? Because I said I'd take him over at 6:30 pm. Who is it? That guy. The young man at the recycling station. He's not here yet? I almost forgot. What's the matter? You look so weird. Ai isn't back yet. Miyuki just called me. Aika? Aika! Chapter I Sin Tsumugi. Tsumugi, did Aika go straight took this way home as usual? So, you went this way home. Are you sure you two didn't meet anyone? Strangers? There's a car parked there. A car? Where? Over there. What color? I think white? no, it's like blue. - What is it? Explain yourself! - Wait, pull yourself Mr. Fujiki! We are sorry. You should better let Mr. Fujiki go home first. All right. It's okay. It's okay. Let's split up. Please gather by residential area. Please assist us. Yes! Aika! Sorry. Aika! Ai! Aika! Aika! Come on out. It's slippery underfoot. Let's go hand in hand. Aika. Be careful! I told you it's slippery. Aika! Please come out if you hear me. A red duffel bag has been found approximately 50 meters north of the Y-road. I repeat a red duffel bag has been found. (Aika) Tsumugi, can you take care of the cash desk a while, please? Yes. We charge you 7,000 yen. The change is 200 yen. Thank you for your patronage. (12 years later) Thank you all for your hard work. We brought food for you guys. Good work. Okay, take a break. Take a break. Here, take it. Take it. Give me some, too. Tsumugi. For you. Don't do this. Hiro. Do you have a minute? You have worked hard. Flat tire? You always have a listless face. I'm driving. I'll drive you home. No need to. What? We're the only two in the same class among all the participants. Let's get along. I'm so sorry. Let's go to the hospital. I'm fine. I'll give you a ride. I'm sorry. It's my fault. When I was a junior high schooler I bought a purse near the shrine. It was very popular at that time. So, everyone went there to buy it. This is it. Drop me right here. If my family knows you drive me home they will be worried. (Let's all work together to keep the area safe) (Let's play together again when Aika comes back! from: Primary 2 Class 1) We were together before she disappeared. I've always thought if I were with her she probably wouldn't have gotten lost. (I'm sorry, Aika! from: Tsumugi) Thank you for the ride. What about the flute? I'm going to Matsumoto tomorrow. I can buy it there. I'll give you a ride. What? I will pick you here at 7 am. It's a little early, but I only can pick you at that time. What about breakfast? I will have it at home. It's just appendicitis. Lie down every day, it'll ruin my body. Isn't your son a murderer? You be quiet. I'm going home now. If I gave the police a little word you and Takeshi will be done. Do you understand? What are you talking about? Didn't I tell you to pay last month's hospital bill first? Where'd I get the money? Let's go. Thanks for taking care of us. Take care of yourself. Thanks for taking care of me. Where's Tsumugi? I think she went somewhere this morning. I don't know what she thinks. Help me get this. How much is it? It's okay. No, I'll pay. How much does it cost? It's okay. I'll pay for it myself. I'll pay. How much? 16,200 yen including tax. 16,200 yen. Thanks. Will it stop raining? Will it stop? If it doesn't stop, the festival will be canceled. I can't even sell these days. Everyone went to buy the good stuff. Talk to your mother. Ask her to come over once in a while. A rag picker only picks up things that people don't want. Junk collectors take everything that people throw away. Your mother's got a lot of guts. She said she came to Japan as a refugee. Who knows if she's telling the truth or not. What's wrong? This is what she has been doing since you were a kid, right? She is my friend. It's the beginning of love. All right, take it all. Do you want to go somewhere? Go to the place where no one knows you? Before I came here my mother took me to many places where my father lived. I was just a kid back then, I don't remember much about it now. It's the same no matter where I go. So, there's no place I want to go to. There's no place? Today ... Today, would you come to the festival? My work ends in the evening. I'm going. Then I'll wait for you. We need to split up and search in groups. Please gather by area and then split up in group by block number. Don't just stand there. We need to find that kid first. First, we need to select the search team leader of the area representative. The team leader has to give me the cell phone number. I'm sorry to interrupt, our leader is here. To everyone, I can't thank you enough for being here. The police have taken action. But we locals can also contribute. You have worked hard. What about the City Hall? Have you asked them? The kid is the daughter of a stone store owner who works in a credit vault. I heard his daughter hasn't come home since she split up with her classmate. The same case that happened 12 years ago. I'm sorry. This is Mr. Tanaka, a beekeeper who lives in the mountain. He just happened to be at the City Hall. I'm Tanaka Zenjiro. I'm Fujiki Goro. You just came from out of the village, didn't you? I hear you're a dedicated beekeeper. Start looking for the kid now. In case something happens we can't handle it. I'm counting on you. The black Africans that living together are very suspicious. Well, if it's the case, then aren't the people at the recycling station near the street more suspicious? The police had been there many times before to investigate the situation. As I said, please follow the group's instructions. Everyone, listen to me! His grandchild, Aika disappeared 12 years ago. When I saw him, I remembered something. At the time of Aika's accident when I found her bag there's a guy holding my hand to keep me away. He was the son of a woman who sells second-hand stuff using a car. That guy lives right over there, near the street. Okay, let's go check it out. Wait! Wait! Zenjiro, I'm going there. That hasn't been confirmed yet. Hey! You're in there, right? Open up! I got a crowbar. Open the door! You're in there, right? Step aside! Hey? Nobody here? Let's go look in the fields. Look in the fields. What the heck is this? Hey, is he here? Over there? Hey! There he is! Over there! Hey you! Over there! Go after him! Hey, get out of the way! Don't run! Hey, you trash! Come out! It's all filthy. Come out! Come out! Throw it all more! More! What are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? I don't understand. More! More! I want to get rid of the edema. Edema? A bubble bath or something. - Sorry. - Welcome. I'm sorry. Please help me. What's going on? Please help me! What's wrong? Help! Help me! What's wrong? Get out! You get out! Get out! Get out! Hey! Stop it! He's crazy. He's there. Get out! Get out! Hey, what are you doing? Get out! Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing, what's this? Don't come in. Don't come in. Don't come in. Come out! Hey, what are you doing? Come out! Come out! What's going on? He poured light oil all over himself and hid in there. Where is he? Where's Takeshi? Goro, where's my son? He didn't do anything. Please believe me. Then why did he run? If he's not the killer, then why did he run? Give me Ai back! If Ai doesn't come back, I want him dead. He really didn't do anything wrong. If he's got everything ... If he's done something bad, it's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's my fault. Aika. Aika! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai! Aika. Be careful! Where's your answer? Yes. You always make trouble. I'm sorry. It's not a toy, it's a commodity. I know. Got it? Got it. Make it quick. No, I got it. You go. Where's your answer? Got it. Don't push the cart over people. Leo, I'll feed you when we get back. Just wait a little longer. I'm a little scared that no one's around. But I feel like I've been captivated by this place. Chapter II Punishment Asako! Asako, where are you going? Ai's back. Ai was back, but she's gone again. I hear she's at the Y-road. She is not there. Aika is not there. She was screaming for help. Didn't you hear her? Listen, she is calling out for help. All right, all right. We going there together. I'm off. Don't you want some breakfast? No need, I'm off now. I'll give you a ride. You're going to be too late. Okay. Here you go. From: Mom I heard they don't seem to have enough people to play the flute at the festival this year, so I was asked to ask you to help them out. Good evening. Zenjiro. We're done with the meeting. I cleaned up the area around Kazui's house and the drains. It's no wonder there were snakes in that mess. Even though my son just came back from Nagano, he's always bothering you. That's okay. I'm late. Hey, it's not a good example that the youngest is the last to arrive. I'm sorry. Zenjiro, have a seat. Shizu. Yes? Make some food for Zenjiro. Okay. Zenjiro is a real piece of work. Where can you find a son who comes back to the village to provide for his parents? I'm sorry to make you busy. This is my daughter. She just came back. She didn't want to be here, a place full of old people and been lived in town. Dad, it's not like that. That's how you are. Ten years later, we'll all be dead, and this place will be gone. Do you work in the direct selling market? Yes, you seem to come there sometimes, right? It's been a year since Masao passed away, right? I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed. Thank you so much for your help. Right, Akiko? Well, yeah. Zenjiro, how much money do you make a month as a beekeeper? I'm always too busy on my own. The annual income of 800,000 to 900,000 An average of about 70,000 a month. So, Zenjiro, tell us your idea. What is it? I think we can revive our village with beekeeping. Open honey stores here. Make some special cakes and attract city people to buy. Who would come to the mountains to buy it? Making up stories blindly. It's a great place for beekeeping. The honey that Zenjiro gave me was delicious. Will it be going good, the honey? Will it? If all goes well, you'll come back to live with us, too. Zenjiro. Please reconsider. Yes. I'm back. I'm Tanaka. Shizu asked me to fix the bathtub. Ah, I see. I'm sorry we make you busy. This work takes longer than you think. It's almost done. You did it great. Just wait till it dries. Thank you so much. You're going to rehearse today, right? That homework needs to be done quickly. You're good at everything, Zenjiro. Leaks, electric wires, drains, you can fix anything. There are only old people in this village. Somebody's got to do those things. Thank you for the drink. You are welcome. He's going to dance at the festival. He was asked to do it. Let's go to rehearsal together. Is it okay? It's going to take hours for the bathtub to dry. I'll drive you there. So, Shinichi, going there with him. All right. It's not so bad after all. Well, although I've said it many times一 - Mr. Kawaguchi. -Yes. Well, play the whole thing again. So everybody remembers. And then Shinichi, do it like this. - Like this, okay? - All right. Are you okay? They are so mean. I have a complete lack of motivation. You're the one who doesn't want to dance. What do you think of my mother? What do I think? She's not a good listener. I still don't quite understand what you mean. Then forget it. You are coming, Tsumugi! Did you miss home? I don't want to back. Then why do you back? They kept nagging about not having enough people, it made me upset. All right, let's do it again. Line up. All right, go ahead. Okay. Gohei team! Sword dancer! Take your place! (gohei: paper and cloth strips dedicated to the gods in Shinto rituals) Zenjiro, do you have any children? I don't have any. It's because your wife died of illness. She was already weak. Before she was 40 she got leukemia and passed away. I got married right after I graduated from Junior College in Nagoya. My family had a traffic accident. How's Nagoya? It's almost the same in any city. Only the hometown is felt special. Now I can all remember. I hated the smell of soil and fertilizer. I worked in a factory in Tokyo since I graduated from high school. Soon after, my sister and brother-in-law opened a small factory in Chiba. That's where I met my wife through friends. I heard she was a baker's daughter, so I was intrigued. I wondered if I would be able to eat bread three times a day at the bakery. - Really? - Ah, stop it! Well ... good night. Ah, hold on a second. Can we go to the festival together? Shinichi's looking forward to it. Gohei team! Sword dancers! Take your places! What do you think? Can you see it? What did you just say? Why are you avoiding me? I'm not. On other days, I told you I'd drive you. I can't believe you got a ride in his car. How did you know that? Are you not afraid? He's a criminal. We don't know yet. But that's what everyone says. That man was the one who murdered Aika. Aika's parents felt the same way. The criminal's already dead. That's why we can all relax now. What are you doing? It was me. I'm the one who punctured your tire. What? Because you're always so cold. I just wanted to create opportunities. That's too much. When push comes to shove we have no idea what to do. We all have our faces on the outside and the inside. So, even that man has it. Leo! Don't bark, Leo. The second half is about to begin. Did I screw you guys up? Is his name Leo? Yes. Leo. That's a good name. Were you at the noodle shop during the fire? You too, Uncle? Did you see the so-called criminal? I saw him when he ran out. What did he look like? Did he look like a murderer? At that time, ... he had already set himself on fire. Hey, somebody please call the police! It's dangerous here. Hey, hurry up and call the City Hall. You okay? Hey! Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshi! Seems the missing girl has been found. Says she's under police protection. The man who abducted her seems to be there. The guy who drove the junk was mistaken for a criminal. He just set himself on fire. It was him, right? Do you know where the criminal is? He was just taken away in an ambulance. He's probably dead by now. You know that guy, don't you? Was it him? The one who murdered Aika? I don't know. I don't know. Why didn't you tell me that he's the one who murdered Aika! Aika's dead. Why are you still alive? You've grown up. Where do you live? What are you doing? I working at a fruit and vegetable market in Tokyo. Tokyo? You must have a good time in Tokyo. Every time I pass by that Y-road I always think “Is it really good that I'm the only one who is happy?” I've been thinking about it. (Attention: If you see anyone suspicious, call 110 immediately) How have you been? It's just like we do in our hometown. Those are the people I see every day. There's nothing fun about it. Why don't you just quit? - Why did you come to my workplace? - What? I'm sure you'd have more fun with someone you know. Let's go somewhere and have fun. Harajuku or somewhere else. Isn't this place close to Shinjuku? All right. - Ah, is it okay to go to Shibuya? - Don't touch my bike. - Hey, that's okay. - Hey. Let's go. Zenjiro! Why didn't you tell us you applied for a grant for industrial revitalization? Pardon? You underestimate us, don't you? I wanted to know their response. So, I went to the Industrial Development Bureau. But there was no definitive answer at the time. If it's something related to the government, it should be me as the district chief. Someone from the government told us. “It seems that your village will be turned to a very interesting village” Honey is important. But, if we can get the grant, we should do other more important things first. The cliff's shield needs to be strengthened. The broken fence during snow removal needs to be repaired as well. It doesn't matter how small our village is we shouldn't be underestimated by the city people. But ... I thought you agreed. Don't get me wrong. Nobody really thinks that's okay. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. You bastard. You're going to drill in secret and sell the resources of the village to the Chinese. What just you said? If you built a waste disposal plant, we wouldn't be able to survive. Do you understand? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb. That's what the people in your village say. Mr. Tanaka. Sorry to interrupt you in your busy schedule. Thirteen years ago, a little girl disappeared at Y-road. And we still don't know where she is. You know about this, don't you? Yes, I'd just gotten back from working in Chiba. If ... If there's anything I'm not doing right, please let me know. We were told recently that your car was white before. Recently, someone came to report it. I'm just trying to get by on beekeeping. Let's build the village together. Did you hear it from the villagers? Which way? Over there? - This way. - Which way is more fun? - What? - Over there. It hurts! Leo! It hurts! Asshole. Leo! Leo! You stupid dog. You did it on purpose, didn't you? You let your dog bite us. A dog is not a vegetarian, Zenjiro. You okay? You okay? Sorry, we kept you waiting. Don't you usually come to places like this? Did you make any friends here? None. What is that? Then why do you still want to go to the city? Don't show me that calm face. Don't you have one? Something that makes you happy while doing it. I don't have. I just wanted to get out of the village. What a dullard. But I think there's one thing that makes me feel happy. Really? What is it? When working at the fruit and vegetable market I can see fruits and vegetables from all over the country. The potatoes from Hokkaido. The pineapples from Okinawa. The lotus root of oak wood or something. It's fun just to see where those fruits and vegetables come from. You're so weird. Waiter! - Yes? - Another draft beer, please. - Another draft beer? - Okay, another draft beer. Do you want some? - Excuse me, make it two. - Yes. - Want two? - Yes. I'm sorry, it's two draft beers. Well, you're really something. You're really impressive. Not like me. You can go to college because you're smart. I was willing to stay in the city but when I filled in my application, the teacher said that I didn't have a chance at all. I didn't have a chance at all. Hey, Hiro, you're talking out of turn. You've had too much wine. I feel dizzy. This is the first time. - Let's go to the karaoke bar. - Yeah. Tsugumi. What do you mean? The promised land? You'll be damned. Sorry, Hisako. Your father suddenly said he doesn't want to go to the onsen. He's a man who won't listen to a word you say. I know, it's okay. And remember this. Don't get too close to Zenjiro. (These are Zenjiro's garbages Take them back!) Zenjiro! I called you a lot. Did you hurt your back? It's my first time going there. I'll use my phone to check it out. Ah, sorry. Where is it? It's very effective for a fall injury. I was planning to go with my parents. I think it's better if we take Leo to the hospital. He's not coming out of his cage. It was decided at the meeting. What happened? He bit people. I heard about it from my mother. I heard you got a penalty. (a penalty: is sanctioned to cut off all contact with the villagers, except for the two cases of funeral and fire) I used to have a dog called Shiro in my house. This dog was so mean. Barking excessively. When I got close to him, he stopped barking. And licked my face desperately. Shiro passed away just before I went to work. He lived for 17 years. There was a dog named Asahi at the factory in Tokyo. He was a grumpy watchdog. But he got to know me right away. You're very popular with dogs. “Why is it just me?” “Why do I have to die?” That's what Noriko said before she died. I said, “I'll be right there with you” Then she said. “You're too crafty” “Pure and pleasing” “You don't have a single word of truth” “Never once did you let me know how you felt” I had been renting an apartment since I got married. I didn't have any dog anymore. Why am I the only one who survived? But lately I don't even remember these thoughts. Zenjiro? (Pervert! Shame on the village) It's on the riverbank next to our apartment. We sometimes could see the canola flowers there. Dad and Mom you two must be in good health and have been working in the fields. Chiba's flowers are not as beautiful as nature there. I missed a kind of scenery there, the place where no one lives. Zenjiro is still the same. Just working, has no smiles at all. But those were the joy days of my life. Tsumugi. Why don't you come and play at my house? I'm not going. Well, you can have this. I don't want it! Chapter III People How did you know? I asked the people at the workplace. You got me. Do you like me now? You okay? Thank you. My parents said that I should be hospitalized near my home but I said no. But in that case ... Tsumugi. Do you remember when you were born from your mother's body? I always feel like I have the memories of it. The moment I come into the world. “Ah, it feels good” “It's so spacious here” “This place is so big” Those kinds of feelings. When I left the countryside and came to Tokyo. I felt the same way. So ... “What am I doing here?” When I got sick, I started thinking that way. Tsumugi? What's wrong? Hiro. Don't go anywhere. Back into a forest. Noriko. I'm gonna turn this place back into a forest. Soon there'll be no one lives here. There might no places left that will be inherited from ancestors. So, even after hundreds of years have passed it would be the same as the old forest of gods, birds, and animals. There's nothing unusual around the alarm. Turn off the lights. What's wrong? Did you find anything? Oh, no. It doesn't look like a major matter. Asako has found eternal rest. Today's weather is good, that's a relief. Count your blessings. It's just a kid's prank, I guess. I'll check it out again. You have worked hard. Nobuhiro. Asako didn't know what happened to Aika until she's dead. It can't be helped. Mom didn't understand anything at the end. It feels like you lived for nothing. Right, Asako? Dad, it's hot outside. Get in the car. To: Tsumugi I sent this because someone asked me to pass it over to you. There is a dry-cleaning coupon with your name on it. From: Mom Legal enforcement can't be interrupted until it is completed. If you interfere with law enforcement, you'll be charged with the crime of obstructing the public service. Mr. Tanaka? Zenjiro! Zenjiro, don't you understand? How many times I have told you? There were also complaints about mood disruptions. Weed trees planted all over the place. You have to abide by the division of land. Fields are not the same as woodlands. Unauthorized changes are giving us a headache. I know! I have told you, Zenjiro! What are you doing? The scene is extremely chaotic. Now, it seems the victim's bodies are still being transported. So far, six people have been killed. It could very well be a serial killer. The scenes are full of blood. It's said they were stabbed with a sharp knife. I'm the daughter of Kurotsuka Issaku. You are a family member. I'll show you the way. We've got a car coming in. Please move out of the way. Excuse me, are you the victim's family? Where's my dad? My mother's name is Shizuki. Where are they? Please step back. Hey, get out of the way! How do you feel right now? Zenjiro. You can't go on like this. I'm not going anywhere. Been indulging in the past is not good. Leo's also not going anywhere. Mom, are you okay? According to a related source the suspect had been arguing with the villagers he killed. It's said that he got a penalty. Why did he do that? The suspect's dog bit the dead man, Mr. Todoroki. (The suspect who makes a living as a beekeeper is on the run. Intense Mountain search underway) So, the villagers decided at the meeting not to let the dog out. (The suspect who makes a living as a beekeeper is on the run. Intense Mountain search underway) After that, the suspect's anger grew. So it's been rumored. The tragedy began when the suspect's dog bit one of the victims, Mr. Todoroki. The dog is still in a cage at the suspect's home. I repeat the victim's name. Kurotsuka Issaku was 90, his wife Kurotsuka Shizuki was 86. Do you need any help? Tabe Ryoichi was 75 and his wife, Tabe Akiko was 75. One of them was just taken away on a stretcher. The man who is believed to be the suspect ... That's why I moved out of the low-rent apartment where Takeshi lived. So, what if we know now? That girl won't come back. Takeshi also won't come back. If you run away from the truth you will feel like you can't live. Let Takeshi comes along with us. You're afraid of that hoodlum, aren't you? You can't even protect your mother. You're a loser. Your mother will cry. Right, Yoko? Whether you're alive or died you're around or not it's disgusting you always act like a ghost. Let's go out for lunch. Let's go. Do you want to leave me? Mom, do you want to leave me? Don't forget to go to Tana's place tonight. All right, stop talking. Let's go. I lied to the police. I was with Takeshi at that time. We had dinner together earlier than usual. And then we went to Tana's place. So you stayed with your son all the time? So you stayed with your mother the whole time? Did Takeshi ... I don't know. I just asked him once. Why did you do something like that? Mom, you told me this when we just came to Japan, right? It's the promised land. If you were asked why you came into the world, would you be able to answer? If you were asked why you died, would you be able to answer? He had been weak since he was a kid. That's why he thought people wanted him dead. How could it be possible? Take a look at this. (It's not Tsugumi's fault) It was in your purse. I'm sure it must be for you. This isn't a place where kids like Takeshi can live. Thank you for telling me this. I don't need any sympathy. You were saved by him, too. Just like everyone else. I want to have a dog. My family owns a bakery. We can't have pets because we manage food. That's why my childhood dream was to get a dog. One time someone offered me a puppy. But it's still not allowed. Then the puppy that I was supposed to pet got sick and died. I've always felt ... It's because I didn't take the puppy, that's why it died. So, if we get married I wish I could have a dog. Do you like dogs, Zenjiro? I love dogs the most in the world. Found him! 1 2 3 We broadcast that the suspect committed suicide. Make a call. Here we go! Shoot! Shoot! No one can trust anyone else anymore. Is this really good? At that time, I was thinking it would be better to let him burn himself to death. None of us would stop until it was over. If someone were to be a sinner, it would end well. Who do you think the ones that could help me? So, I breathed a sigh of relief when the fire spread. You all the ones who killed Takeshi. It really can't end like this. He won't be forgotten. Aika also won't be forgotten. We can only carry the burden forward. But I'm too old for that. That's not the case. I told you, that's not the case. You don't understand. I don't want to understand. It doesn't matter if I don't understand. Who is the criminal? It doesn't matter if I don't understand. It doesn't matter if I don't understand. I'll stick to my faith and stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive. Why are you crying? Nobody's playing with you? Bye bye. What happened to you? Did someone throw you away? Come here. What is it? Are you a girl? Do you want to come to my house? Are you coming? Come in. Your name's Leo. That name suddenly popped into my mind. Isn't that a good name? Okay, let's go. What's it? Tsumugi, I will be discharged tomorrow. I see. The doctor says the survival rate in five years is only 50 percent. I don't know much about this stuff. But I'll try my best. That's great. Aika! Let's go. Tsumugi, let's build the promised land for us. (The Promised Land) Translation: neet21 Thank you for using these subtitles Destiny comes from nowhere Like a breeze on my face Once being touched I know it's impossible to resist at last I swim against the stream with wounds Like one of those fishes The way for us to struggle Remain hardly any I can't live with dreams alone Though I collected pieces of reality My heart has become rusty inside now Stiff, blunt and sunken just as it is Yet at least Having this much though Sound good, right? It's not a big wish Just a glimpse of light that no one notices Even if my dream gets lost somewhere This way I know that silhouette will become the leading light In the wilderness without soil what people would see is Not anyone but voice “this way” And the brightest star Surely when I look up to the next destiny I will catch it with my hands Lyrics translation: Jade Salt
