Who am I kidding? I'm no writer. I've been trying to write the story of our courtship now for 10 years. All I know is it's a great story, a romantic comedy. And if it were made into a movie, I know just what it would look like. You gotta pretend it's 1968 and I'm 24 years old. - Who's this? - Hi, Mom? - Yes? - Guess what? - What? - I met the girl of my dreams. - What? - Well, tell you about it? Sure. - Oh. - Well, she's a widow with five children. And she's 14 years older than me. But she's Jewish. All right, that's not the way it really happened, but it might've been better if I had done it that way. The movie starts with one of those calendar flipping images to let you know we're going back in time. It settles in 1948. This is one of those movies where you see two people in the past and then their lives come together on a chance meeting. The scene opens in a suburban home where we meet Nina. She's a senior in high school. Next to her yearbook picture, it says, "Ambition is to get married." You have to remember that in 1948, being a capable homemaker was considered a noble profession. Nina comes from an upper middle-income family. Her dad's an optician. - Let me take a look. Let me see what I can do for you. This tank holds castor oil, which is fed through pipes of tiny. - That should do it. Okay, try these on. - Four winds. Propulsion is by hydraulic pressure. - How's it feel? - Ah, it feels much better. - While you're here, let me just make sure that your prescription's up the date. Take a look at that chart and start reading those letters. - Okay. F P T O Z L P E D. - Ned. Good job, Ned. Good job. - Hey! - Whoa, good job! You get the ball, you get the ball. Go ahead, go get it. Good job, buddy. And her mom, well, her mom's there to nurture the children. - Well, you know, Arlene is her father's favorite. Ned, of course, is my favorite. But you, you were my first born. - In spite of this, Nina was very comfortable with herself. She saw herself as ordinary. Being the oldest child, she was sensible, responsible, and dependable, and she was honest, painfully honest, but always sensitive to the feelings of others. She was at ease with her own mediocrity while at heart, she was a romantic. And while her relationship with Buddy had run its course as high school graduation comes to an end, Buddy's entering the armed forces, and Nina promises to write. ♪ Coulda woulda budgy and told you you should ♪ ♪ Coulda woulda budgy, woulda ♪ ♪ I give you a nudge and a push and a touch ♪ Attention in the platform committee off the convention floor. The committee overwhelmingly rejects an amendment strongly supporting the president's civil rights program. But when the committee chairman, Senator Myers of Pennsylvania, presents the platform of the convention. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. You know, I noticed your store, New York Bakery. Figured I'd stop in and see what kind of merchandise you sell. - Well, sir, these breads and rolls come from a bakery in New York, and we're the only store in town that carry these breads. There's pumpernickel, challah, rye bread, and kaiser rolls. And over here, we have penny candies, but they all don't cost a penny. Some are twofers or threefers, and even this one, Sen-Sen, are even four for a penny. - Back in 1948, this is what we called a dime bag 'cause you could fill it with 10 cents worth of penny candy. - I'll take one of each. - All right! - You know, while I'm here, I think I might pick up a few more things. Do you sell toilet paper? - Yes we do, sir. What kind would you like, fine or coarse? - I'll take one of each. Thank you. I did take one of each, right? - Yes sir. - Great. - Oh, Bubby, not everybody caught that. Bubby is the Yiddish word for grandmother, and while I'm at it, Zeyda means grandfather. She taught me how to play the piano. - That's so good! All right, here we go. I'm gonna do it at the same time. Bravo! - And how to make change at the cash register. - $2.60. All right, 60. Put the three dollars in. - And then the change would be 67 cents. - Oh, Yale, you're a genius! Ah, that's fabulous. Boy, do you know your math. - The room in the back of the store had been Bubby's home after she separated from Zeyda. When business was slow, we would sit in the back room and play cards, or Bubby would tell me stories and impart her old world wisdom. One day, I was showing off and said. - Hey, Bubby, check out my muscle. - Would you look at that? But you know who the strongest man in the world is? - Is it Superman? - No. The strongest man in the world is the one who can hold. - And here she hangs on the word hold. - The strongest man in the world is the one who can hold his temper. Would you like to play cards like we did last week? - Yes. - When we played cards, - Okay. - Bubby let me keep score. This was her way of helping me learn math. I'd win most of the time, and I don't think she was letting me win either. - Ah! - Sometimes she'd just tell me stories about what life was like for her in Russia when she was a young girl. - I think you're winning. - The imagery I remember best was what winters were like in Russia. - When we would walk through the snow, you could hear hrunch hrunch, the way the snow makes the sound under your feet. And the trees were covered with ice. They sparkled like diamonds, so bright, you had to squint your eyes just to look at them. Hm. - If you ever see the movie "Dr. Zhivago," you'll know exactly what Bubby was talking about. - Okay, you're winning. Let's call it this your game. Now wash your hands. We're gonna have dinner. - On the back wall was an oval frame with a picture of Bubby's father. Bubby's father's name was Yale. His eyes followed wherever I went. It was just like Bubby's voice in my conscience if I even thought of doing something that was naughty. - You were named after my father. He was a great rabbi and a great man, and so God will have a great plan for your life so that you, too, will become a great man. Pretend you're having a dream. Close your eyes. And in this dream, you're out in a lake in a rowboat with your wife and your mother, and it's a beautiful sunny day. But all of a sudden, the boat tips over, and you're all thrown into the water. Neither your mother nor your wife can swim, and you can only save one of them. What should you do? You should wake up! Remember I said you were having a dream? And the point is you should never have to make such a decision. Come sit down. This is a cute poem I've been thinking about recently. Do you wanna hear it? - Sure. - "A daughter is a daughter all of her life, but a son is a son till he takes him a wife." - Okay, I recognize the intention of this poem. - You think about that. I'm gonna go get dinner. - I was being raised with Jewish guilt, but even at that young age, I understood a bit more. You were telling me I shouldn't be that way, but apparently, that's normal. It's three years after getting married, and Nina is giving birth to their second child. - Buddy, Buddy! - Nurse! - Doctor, doctor! - Nina looks forward to being a good mother and a good wife. - You're gonna have a baby, Nina. - Deep breaths. - What are you gonna name him? - Raymond. - Good, you're gonna name him Raymond. Nice. Pay attention to my voice. - She'll have a perfect family, one boy and one girl. - Push. That's good. - And we get the idea there will be more kids to come. - My first taste of entertaining a captive audience. I loved it. - Stanley, can you see him? He's a man now. I'm so proud. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry. Look at him! - Shh! - As for my bar mitzvah party. - Rabbi, I'm sorry. Is this offensive? - No, it's fine. It's fine - Am I allowed to do this? I don't even know the rules. - No, it's okay. In fact, I was gonna ask you. Are you available, by chance? - Available? What do you mean? - Partying in a hot tub? - Excuse me, rabbi? - That was a joke. - You are something else. Stop it, rabbi. - Thank you so much. - You're a jokester, aren't you? - My bar mitzvah party was a simple gathering of friends and family members at our home. What I remember most about it was that I spiked my cousin Alan's orange soda. - I'm sorry. I mean, I don't wanna be rude or anything. - It's no problem. - There he is, there he is. Oh my goodness, you are so good. Look at you! - You did a wonderful job. - You're a man. You're so handsome. - Thank you, Aunt Shirley. - unbelievable. Did you eat anything yet? - No, but I'm really kinda thirsty. - Well, Marilyn's making the food. - Oh, I hope it's good. Is she a good cook? - And, you know, I'm really serious about that hot tub. - I'm a very progressive type of rabbi. - Oh, progressive. I think you mean aggressive rabbi. - Oh, maybe. - A little while later, he was naked and getting ready to come down and show the crowd that he was a windshield wiper. - Look, everybody! I'm a windshield wiper! - Alan! - I'm a windshield wiper, everybody! - He's doing. Get inside! - Look, everybody! - Get in! - I'm a windshield wiper. - It's embarrassing. Alan, honey, get up! Oh, he's always had a problem with his cerebellum, you know. It's just, go inside. - But on the serious side, the months of bar mitzvah practice that preceded this big day and all the thoughts of becoming a man meant that you were now responsible for your own sins. It's the day after my bar mitzvah I'm lying in bed. I just woke up, but I'm still in that kind of drowsy state, half awake, half asleep. Directly across from me is a clock radio. All the while I'm lying there, the numbers 7:59 weren't changing, but then the numbers flipped over. I suddenly realized, even though I'm not moving, time is. It doesn't stop. Time keeps on going. - Oh my God, I'm dying! Every second that clicks off the clock is bringing me closer to the day I'll die. Everyone on the planet is dying. No one's doing anything about it. I mean, if there were a plague killing people off, you'd see it all over the TV and in newspaper headlines. But what about old age? I mean, that doesn't seem to bother anyone else. People just seem to accept the fact that people get old and then old people die. Well, I'm sorry, but that's just not acceptable. How can you get on with your life knowing that you're just going to die in the end? This is really a big deal. This is literally a matter of life and death. So what do I do now? - I found the solution. - I got it! - I just had the same disease that every person is blessed with, mortality. Problem solving technique number one. I call this the eliminate the problem solution. So what did I discover about the problem that everybody dies? Simply this. You don't have to. Your state of mind affects your immune system, and your body behaves accordingly, so the solution is don't believe in dying. There, that does it. Well, now I have a new problem. What do you do with infinity? I talked to everyone about it, my parents, my friends. I tried to learn how others dealt with these concerns. - Excuse me, ma'am. What would you do if the doctor told you you had 24 hours to live? - Well, that's not enough time. 24 hours just isn't enough time to do anything. I'm not silly to think that we'll live forever, but what does the doctor know anyway? That's how I think of it. - And you, ma'am? What about a week? - That's still not enough time. You think a week is enough time to put things in order and say goodbye to your loved ones? I just don't think about it. - Sir, what about a year? - I don't know. I mean, a year is not enough time for me, at least. I feel like I'd just be sitting down there every day, thinking about the days and not the time I have left. So what's the point? Who wants to know how much time I have left? Answer, no one. Have a good one, kid. - What really brought it together for me was what my Bubby said on her death bed. This was my father's mother, not the woman with the grocery store. - What's going on with Bubby? - My mother isn't doing well, Yale, and that's why I called you here today. I thought you might want one last chance to talk with her. - All right, If you need anything else, Mrs. Schwartz, just give me a buzz. - Hi, Bubby, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well, thought maybe I could cheer you up. - It was nice you should come to visit. - I wrestled with life's big questions, the fear of dying, the fear of not living, what life's all about. - Bubby, I've always wondered. How did you meet Zeyda? - We met at a dance. I was a beautiful young girl living in New York City. I had a lot of boyfriends. And I gave it all up for a window cleaner from Tamaqua. If I knew how it would all turn out, I'd have lived my life differently. - Wow, what a horrible way to end your life. But there's a lesson to be learned from this. You can't wait until you're on your death bed to deal with your regrets. You have to examine your life satisfaction level frequently. And if you're unsatisfied with your life, you've got to do something about it immediately, even if all you can do is to lay out a plan and then begin executing it. - How would I feel while lying on my own death bed? Would I look back on my life and say, "I love what I did with my life"? What I wanted was something that gave infinite pleasure. - Why? - Okay, what's wrong? - I just broke up with Susan. When men and missions. - That's all right. - You'll share a life that honors. - You'll get over it. That's just puppy love. - Echoed by all. - But if that's puppy love, then what's real love? And how do I know if I found it? Suez invasion debacle was replaced as prime minister by Harold. - When you can't live without her. - And then it hit me. And shrinking colonial. - Oh. Thanks. - An upset election ousted prime. - Love, true love. When you have that, everything else in life makes sense. We see that I had a close rapport with my parents, especially my mother. Cheer up, come on up. I have an idea. Come on up. This is the jitterbug. - She taught me how to dance, particularly how to jitterbug. She inspired my taste for big band music, and she defined my understanding of true love. - Here's called the cuddle. That's my boy. - Can't live without her. - Well, there it was, another puzzle for this young mind to sort out. Can't live without her. What does that really mean? Would you drop over dead if she left you? No, of course, not, you wouldn't be able to get on with your life. You wouldn't care about eating or sleeping. Life would be intolerable. I pondered this notion for years. Finally, I summed it up this way. Have you ever seen a movie where the husband is driving home late at night, and as he turns onto the corner on the street where he lives, he sees some kind of connection of up ahead? There's a crowd of people and fire trucks and police cars, and he realizes it's his house that's on fire. He jumps out of the car and runs up to the front of the crowd and yells, "My wife, where is she?" A cop yells back, "She's in the house! They can't get her out!" The man yells, "I'm going in after her!" The cop yells back, "You can't!" What do I do now? Problem solving technique number two is called follow your goal. What does he do? He runs into the house, of course. - Help! - There's not a moment's hesitation. It doesn't matter if there's only one chance in a million that he can save her because he can't live without her. - Aww. - And now the movie shifts to real time. It's the summer of 1967. - Good morning, Vietnam! - Yale! - Two years ago, a Claymore mine. - Hey. Look who's back in town. Wake up! - Today, Americans rarely eat them. - Come on. I know we had plans. I'm sorry. Were you gonna drink that? Oh. I know we had plans, but totally forgot about Nina. Yale, come on. You know what I'm talking about, Nina. I told you about her, remember? Nina, my friend. - Who? - She has five kids. Her husband, he died to that C word. Do you remember? Listen, we're gonna go over there, all right? I told her I was gonna go ahead and set up for her party. You're gonna help me. You're so good at that. You're so good at helping everybody feel better, all right? You're gonna get up right now. Look at me. Look at Aunt Shirley. Get yourself dressed, all right? I'm gonna go out in the car. I'm gonna wait for you, so get up, all right? Ooh, I'm so happy you're home! I'll be out here. Hurry up. Let's go, babes. Quick hardening cement. - I was wondering, remember that kid who was at your bar mitzvah? That kid, what's his name? Alan? Alan? Remember he was all drunk? Whatever had happened to him, huh? Do you ever talk to him? I wonder how he turned out. Probably nuts like his mother. - How did I let myself agree to this? I've seen Aunt Shirley's girlfriends. Let's just say I'm not interested. - Oh my God! - Oh my God, I could just take bite right out of that. - And look at the size of his wallet! - Why are you ignoring me? What's your problem, huh? I'm just gonna park right here. Nina! Nina, we're here. Come on, get out. - I'm guessing this Nina girlfriend will probably look like the little old lady who lived in a shoe with so many children, she didn't know what to do. She'll probably come wobbling out of the house with her hair in a bun and a mole on her cheek. - Nina, baby girl, we're here. Come here. - Whoa. - Hey, you didn't have to beep. I think the whole neighborhood heard ya. - Oh, whatever. - This might not be so bad after all. - Come here. Oh, I'm so glad you're here! - What are you, a supermom or something? - Oh, stop. - Oh, look at you. You are beautiful. You're beautiful. Oh, here's Yale. Wait till you see. Come here, Yale. - I didn't know you were bringing anybody. - Come on, Yale. Come on. Look at my handsome nephew. You're gonna love him. He's so sweet. He needs something to do. - If I knew your nephew was coming, I would've, you know, put some clothes on, maybe. - Honey, stop. Come here. - Hi, I'm Nina. - Hi. - My gorgeous nephew, Yale. He can help you with anything. - Okay, well, there's lots to do, so, oh, you guys wanna come in? - Let's go. Come on up. Oh, this is so exciting. The birthday. - I could use all the help I can get. - Stop! - Give me my money! - David, come on. Get yourself up off the floor. - Stop! - Come on. We have company. Get off the floor. - Give me my money. - Come on, David. - Stop cheating. - Where's that birthday boy? Ooh, you come see Auntie Shirley. Ooh, I love you! - Kids, I have some introductions. Okay, so this is Kate, Mona, Ray, Adam, and that is David. Kids, can you say hello to Yale, please? Kids! Can you say hello to Yale, please. I need so much help, please. You see this place? It's a mess. - Look. I'm gonna go outside, get it set up. Then I'll come here, clean up You just relax. - Oh, thank you. - All right? - Thank you. - So listen. - Where's Stanley? - Oh, he's in a mood, you know what I mean? He's been working so hard. - Hi. - Hey, hey. - Wait, whose turn is it? - Stop, stop! - Gimme! - Give me my money! - Stop cheating! - You're cheating! - Stop! - you're cheating. - When is this a bad thing? All of a sudden, all these problems. But listen, I want you to stop fretting about this. I'm here to help, all right? I'm gonna go set up outside and smoke since I'm not allowed to do it in here. - Yes, please, thank you. - Hi, Aunt Shirley. I was thinking I'd come over and visit. No, that's too obvious. I was thinking I would stop by for a visit. Maybe we could go see your friend, Nina. That's way too obvious. Maybe we could stop by and see your friend, Nina. I don't need Aunt Shirley. Yeah. Nina and I were already friends. Yeah. - At this stage, Nina was really just a friend. - Is this your first time playing gin? - Not quite. - I enjoyed her company. - 'Cause I'm smoking you. All right, thank you. She is unbelievable. - That she is. - Thank you. - I'd talk about my philosophy of life and about the girls I was dating. - I needed that. Thank you. Gin! Five to two. - Nina talked about the kids and about the men her friends were fixing her up with. There was this way Nina drew out the word three as she counted - Three, four, five. - that always got my attention. We'd chat over coffee and home-baked chocolate chip cookies. - So I overheard you and Aunt Shirley talking about guys she's trying to set you up with. - No, but the pictures that you see. - Yeah, well, I don't really go out too often, but I'll tell you one thing for sure. The moment I step out of this house, I whip out my wallet and I show them a picture of my five children. I want them to know right from the beginning I come with attachments. - Nina was 36 years old, and her friends were fixing her up with 50-year-old men. We gave each other dating tips. - All right, well here's my first tip. At least wait until the date's over to show them the picture. You know, like when he walks you to the front door right before he leans in for a kiss good night, that's when you show him the picture. - Hmm. You might be onto something. Now finish dealing those cards so I can beat you again. - And we remained nothing but friends over the course of an entire year. Then one day, I suggested we take the kids to fly kites on the beach. - Girls, make sure Adam and David are okay! Don't get too close to the water. - I began to think how much more I had in common with Nina in contrast to the girls I'd been dating. That's when I began to fantasize about falling in love with her. After all, age is just a number, and since this was my fantasy, I began to goof around with various inane ideas to make Nina fall in love with me. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Hi. How can I help you? - I jotted down these catalog numbers for quite a few books. None of them seem to be on the shelves. - I can take a look. - Thank you. - These are all in the subject of witchcraft. We don't really keep these on the shelves. - Thank you. - But if you tell me what you'd like them for, I can bring whichever one you'd like. - I'm curious to see recipes for a love potion. - A love potion? Are you planning to concoct a potion for someone to drink? - No, no, of course not. I'm actually doing research on the ingredients used in these love potions. - I see. You know, inviting such a drink could cause sickness or even death. - That's understandable. In fact, that's what my report concerns, understanding the ingredients and trying to determine why these people thought such potions could generate feelings of love. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Where would I find that, eye of newt? Thank you. - Oh, I hope so. - The next inane tactic I considered using was one I'd seen in a movie where Walli Coxx, playing a very shy young man, goes to a gypsy woman and learns how to cast a spell on the object of his desires by giving her the look. - Something physical going on. - The look requires that you gaze into her eyes and concentrate on a particular incantation. - I'd say the perception. Oh, I hope so. - It's guaranteed to make any woman surrender to you. - These athletes are so concerned. - I've gotta save this for just the right moment. - That is not true. - , lunch is in the fridge. - Hello? - Oh, hi. What are you doing here? - Just thought I'd stop by for a visit. - Bad luck. I'm about to meet up with the girls. - Where are you guys going? We're going into Philly to the Russian Tea Room. We're gonna have our fortunes read. - This is a great opportunity. I used to do fortune telling. - No kidding. I'm really into that stuff myself. Mind if I tag along? - I don't see why not. I'm sure the girls won't mind. - Am I gonna get in trouble? - Can I see that? Let me show you how it works. - Think about the money. - Show her how it works. Show her how it works. - You just, oh, oh! See? Isn't she cute? - See, look at that. - And then they keep getting smaller. - Yeah, Buddy was my high school sweetheart. - You're so good! - Security at your age. You've got five kids. Come on. - Come on, ladies. I am looking for somebody who is gonna be good with my kids, who's gonna accept me and them and not look at me like damaged goods just because I have a couple children, - Couple of kids. - okay? - Well you are - I'm not- - not damaged goods. - Thank you, thank you. - You are not. - There's this other guy I can think of named Sam Epstein. Does anybody know him? - Oh, I know him. - Are you kidding? - He might be like a year younger, but that's really not. - Not Alan! - That's fine, I just don't like much older. Shirley's always setting me up with these grandfathers, and that's not my thing. - Grandfathers. - Yeah, I know him from the temple. Oh, he contributes, and there's a room named after his family. They're like big contributors, and I've heard he's really nice on top of being really rich. - I've been on my own since I was a teenager. I think I can take care of me and the kids. I just would like some companionship. - Absolutely. - I don't need someone to provide for me. - Yeah, but still. - Just because I have kids, I don't need someone to pay for me and my kids. - You have five kids! - That's not my thing. - Would you stop? We're gonna get trouble with all this. - See? Isn't she cute? Maybe she'll be able to channel Buddy. That's what I'm hoping. - I finished my tea, so can I go first? - You can go first because as far as I'm concerned, I'd kind of rather see how this goes before I decide what questions I wanna ask, right? - What do you mean by that? - You know how personal the questions and answers are gonna be or the explicit details she may wanna know about us. - Oh, would you stop it? I've been here before. It's not a big deal. It's all generic. What? Oh, come on. - Do you know this- - What? Is there a camera in the bedroom? - Dirty mind! - Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. - Well, maybe I have a guilty, you know, conscience. - I can read your fortune either way, tea leaves or tarot cards. I happen to prefer tarot cards because they're more reliable. - Can we get started? - Yes, you can begin. You can ask me a specific question, or you can ask for general reading of what the future holds in store for you. - Ooh! - I like that. I'll have one of those. - Please begin by telling me your date of birth, including the time of day as best as you may know of it, and approximately where geographically on the planet you were born. Well, I was born right here in Philadelphia, and my birthday is February 7th at 2:30 in the morning, 1932. - Stop. - Now, my birthday's December 4th. Could you read me? - We'll finish her first. - All right, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just excited! I'm excited! - Wait your turn. - I see you living a very long, healthy life. - See? So don't worry about me. That's really good. Health is really that important. That is. That would be. - I see you and your spouse becoming very successful in the near future. - So lucky! - And you will live a long, happy, healthy lifetime with a lot of friends and a large family. - A large family? I have only one daughter. - Just wait and see how many grandchildren she will give you. - Ooh! - Oh, my! Oh, stop it, Diane! - Rachel, you're the best! You're better than your. - Excuse me. Excuse me. What zodiac sign is most compatible with mine? I'm an Aries. - I believe that would be Sagittarius. - And my future love? What might she look like? - The fortune teller followed my lead and described my future love as looking just like Nina. - I see her being a very attractive, maybe a little more mature than you, very independent, strong willed. - She was literally reading me like an open book. Balance of payment deficit has nearly reached $4 million. The president, during the final days of September, called a meeting of the men most familiar with the complex problem. Leading the contingent was the chairman of the Federal Insurer Board, which , followed by Secretary of the Treasury Fowler, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Commerce Trowbridge. - Hello? - Hi, Nina? - Yeah? - Last minute decision. The company that I'm working for, Boeing, they decided that the computer project that I'm working on needs to be installed hands on by the guy who it. That's me. - Oh, nice. - Yeah, I'm going to San Francisco, but I'll be home in a week. - Oh, San Francisco? - So don't go looking for a substitute for our gin rummy game, okay? - Now I can't make any promises. - I'll be home in a week. - A week? - Yeah. - Oh, but that's a long time. All right, well, be safe. - I will. - Make sure you call when you get there. - All right, bye. - I couldn't wait to get back from this trip to see Nina's reaction. Roger, 4807, approaching runway. - Hello? - Did you have a nice trip? - It was great, yeah. - No, never mind then. What's the big idea with this insurance policy? When I saw what this was, I thought, "God forbid, what if your plane had crashed?" How would I ever explain this to your mother, let alone Aunt Shirley? - Final decision reached on the last. - "Nice," I thought. "I'm getting to her." - Then when I thought about what you did, I cried, you know, sitting right here at the dining room table, and that's when little David came over to me with a Kleenex and he said, then he said, "Don't cry, Mommy." And, I mean, I was a mess. Well, listen, you didn't win the big money prize, but as a consolation gift, I decided to get you something a little more personal. I think I have you right where I want you. - If you win tonight, I have a batch of chocolate chip cookies in the oven for ya. - Share the spotlight with the Dave Parks flight. - If. - I think one of the most typical where guys and gals. - Dance with her, Yale. It's just a jitterbug. It's not like an intimate slow dance. - Do you know how to jitterbug? - What? - Come on, dance with me. Come on, get up. - No, no, I was winning! - let's go, come on. - Oh my God. - Now say something sexy, but keep it light and funny. - This move's called the cuddle. My mother actually taught me this move when I was 13, and when you're 13, this is one sexy move. What? - You better sit down now. Don't press your luck. And that's when the flirting began, completely innocent flirting. After all, it was all just in my imagination, pretending that this woman could find me romantically interesting. But that's what made the flirting safe for both of us. - I hope you're bringing your best game tonight because I've been working on a new strategy. - Good luck with that 'cause tonight, you're going up against my mystic mental telepathy. ♪ Ba da woulda woulda ♪ - Throw me the card that fits right between here. ♪ Coulda woulda kitten ♪ ♪ Find a cat smitten ♪ ♪ Stake 'em, wake 'em ♪ ♪ Off a him you mitten if you don't get bitten ♪ ♪ Take 'em, shake 'em ♪ ♪ Round 'em around up and down for the town ♪ - Gin! You don't stand a chance, too easy. ♪ Ba da woulda woulda ♪ ♪ Bing boom ba ba da woulda woulda ♪ - Now there was more dancing. ♪ I just can't get enough ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ This is too much ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ I'm over the moon ♪ ♪ And I'm so amused ♪ - Holding her in my arms was an intense step forward. And while we danced, I whispered in her ear and nestled her hair. ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ - Now you have to promise not to fall in love with me. Because I am so irresistible, I feel it's only fair for me to warn you. - I'll try to restrain myself. Happy birthday. - "Happy birthday. You're a chicken? Nope, I'm an egg. Do you think everyone should be an egg? No, but I think everyone should be laid. Is everyone laid? No. Some people are chicken." Thank you. Then we danced, but we dance slow dances. But finally, one night, I decided it was the right time to apply the look, the tactic that I had been holding in reserve, the sure-fire move I learned from that Walli Coxx movie. ♪ Someone told me not to wait ♪ - I gazed into her eyes. I silently repeated the magical phrase. Then I gave her the look. ♪ True as a ♪ - Oh Yale, I love you so much. ♪ Shines warm on my face ♪ - That kiss and those words would not be denied. I had to rationalize our new relationship. She'd been mesmerized by the look. So what do I do now? Problem solving technique number three, make a joke. - I warned you not to fall in love with me. - Our new relationship became the only thing we talked about. She was alive and involved in life with children who depended on her for their very survival. - Oh, hey girls. - Hi. - What are you doing down here? - The boys are asleep. - Oh, okay. You guys going to bed? - This was a turning point for me, a call to action to live up to the ideals I believed in. - Good night, sweetie. Can you say goodnight to Mr. Schwartz, please? - Good night, Mr. Schwartz. - Goodnight. - All my life was lived on the periphery, the ramblings of a young man's fancy. I needed to examine all aspects of this decision. So I have to tell you something. - All right, what is it? - Not here. We should probably go in the other room. - But in actuality, they were helping the president put the final. - We moved to the sofa and talked late into the night about this thing we started. Close to equilibrium. The final decision to read upon the last. - So something's come up. Shirley invited me to a family party in Hazleton. She wants to set me up with some guy named Jerky or Jerry or something. I'm not interested, okay? But how do I say no without making her suspicious? - What do we do now? - So you'll go, and perhaps, independently, I'll decide to visit my family at the same time. But remember, we have to watch how we behave in front of others. - This much I knew for certain. I wanted us to reach our own decision before we shared our feelings with my family. - Peace, love, and rock and roll. That's what we need here. - We're talking about the new '68s. That's where Chevy's really got. - I don't know what the whole Vietnam thing is about it. I don't know how we got involved in it. - I don't, either. - Our family home on Tamarack Street was better known as Herring Row, just two blocks from the synagogue. - It's a tough decision. I'm on the fence - Okay. - about getting rid of it. - Trust me, Nina. I'm telling you right now. There she is. - Ah! - There she is! - My favorite auntie. Oh! Oh, it's so nice to see you. This is Nina. - Hi, I'm Nina. Nice to meet you. - Ah, you're beautiful. - Isn't she gorgeous? - Aw, thank you, thank you. - You enjoy yourself, you beauty queen you. Okay, he's here, he's here. I know. - Can't wait to meet him. - There he is. Hey! - You have got to be kidding me. - He's delicious. Jerry, come here. - Do not call him over here, please. - You, get over here. - Please. - Oh my gosh. Look at him. - You always do this to me. - What? You're always complaining about everybody. Look at this young buck. I found him the other night, you know, when I went out and I didn't tell you about it. - He looks like a stripper. - Oh my God, stop it. You're constantly complaining, "Oh, everyone's old." Good Lord. He is like Tarzan wrapped up in a box of loveliness. Oh, he is delicious. I never wanna hear from you again. - I'm Jerry. - Hi. I'm Nina. If I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? - Stop. He can touch whatever he wants. - Oh my God. - Something else, you know. - Nailed it. - Oh, yes, it is a beautiful day, Mom. - It's always nice to have our beautiful daughter with us, always nice. - Good to see you. Look at all the people here. It's Yale! - Hey, Yale! - That's Yale. What do you think? I wasn't expecting him. - Yale! What are you doing here? - here today. - My, that's a surprise. - What's the occasion, dear? - Interesting. - What's the occasion, dear? - I missed everybody. I just wanted to stop by and say hi. - Oh! - Oh, I wouldn't have missed it, Mother. - Sid, take a look. - Oh, by the way. Something I wanna talk to you about a little bit later. - Oh my God. Oh my God. Shirley, I am gonna kill you. Stop it, stop it. Oh my God. - I tried to get here as soon as I could. Traffic was a mess. - Thank God you're here. - I couldn't believe his opening line. "If I told you you had a nice body, would you hold that against me?" - Ugh. - Ew! - Gag me. Who even says that to a woman? Is that a real line? - No one. - Ugh, and the dance moves. Come on, the dancing. Jerky's the perfect name for him. So you don't think we gave anything away by the way we were acting, do you? - No, not a chance. I think we were very discreet. - Good. There's Yale and Nina again. - I guess. - One of the neighbors was Minnie Chaskin. - Anybody know where the cocktails are? Cocktail table! - Some time ago, Minnie became a widow, got diabetes, and, due to the illness, was eventually pronounced legally blind. Although she could only see shadows, she'd often surprise her friends with comments about the outfits they were wearing. - You're gonna give us away. - Who's that? - Hi, Minnie. It's me, Yale. I'm with Nina. We're just talking. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. - Uh huh. - She was hiding behind the bush. I told you. - I didn't know she was gonna come out of nowhere like that. - And her memory for details was astounding. - That's why you shouldn't have been feeling me up at a family party. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Minnie a clever way of finding things by asking questions with assumptions built in. She probably asked Dad something like this. - So how long have Nina and Yale been seeing each other? - At the time, Dad had no idea we were dating. - Who told you that? - He didn't say anything to Mom right away because he didn't want to alarm her. And three months later, we had our first talk. - Yale. - Yeah? - The reason I asked you to help me today is because there's a question I've been meaning to ask you. - Yeah. What is it? - Are you having relations with Nina? - Wow. I thought a bit before answering. - How was that any of your business? - Well, are you? - I could lie. I could tell the truth. Yeah, Dad, I am. I love her, and I'm seriously thinking about marrying her. - How am I supposed to explain this to your mother? - He said that as if that should be some reason for me to stop seeing Nina. Dad, that's your problem. I have a list of my own concerns. - The conversation went all over the place from there, but it concluded this way. But I promise I'll stop seeing her just to slow down. - Now that our relationship is out in the open, it's hard to focus on our specific concerns because of the static my family introduces. Did I say static? No, that's too kind. What they introduce our unsolicited opinions, insane rage, and every nasty trick they can dream up. Now I don't mean to vilify my parents. They're doing the best they can to prevent me from making what seems to them like a terrible mistake. Unfortunately, they still think of me as the 10-year-old kid who wanted the cheap red scooter today instead of waiting for a better one tomorrow. They fail to recognize that at age 24, I've matured beyond my years, dare I say even beyond their years. They simply aren't the kind of parents who can hold an objective conversation, nor could they relate to my philosophy of life. Oh, how well I remember their attempts at logic. - Yale, what makes you think you have what it takes to raise five children? Your mother and I had a hard enough time raising just two. - You just make sure you go see a psychiatrist before you ever marry her because you're out of your mind! - I told me I was taking the time out to think things over. Then my best friend, Jerry, and I drove west. It was a desperate attempt to see if Nina and I could learn to live without each other. - Here in Tiger Stadium Detroit, a truly dramatic ball game. - What are you doing? - I decided I had to come back. I gotta go home and see Nina. - You what? - I figured it out. I gotta tell her that I'm okay. I figured it out. I know what I wanna do. - Yale, are you out of your mind? Let's go, we're almost there. Let's keep going. - I need to tell her that everything's okay, I'm okay. - Yale, listen to me. Listen to me. We got Cubs tickets. We've got the party line. There are gonna be tons of chicks in Chicago. Are you crazy? You gotta get this girl out of your mind. God, Nina, Nina, Nina. That's all I ever hear anymore. Come on. We're almost there. Cubs. Chicks. Party, bro. Cubs, chicks, parties. You give that all up to go flying back to Nina. - Jerry, I'm sorry, I- - God. - We drove back nonstop. - You're crazy, you know that? - You're crazy! - Maybe. - How far we've gone. Apollo 8. I wonder how they do that in space with all that stuff. - So how did Kate work out with the bake sale? The rocket hurls three astronauts toward the moon. - You are my firstborn. - Thank you, Mom. - I couldn't wait to see her. When I came into the house, I was so intent on sweeping her into my arms that I was completely unprepared to find her parents were there. - Hello? Nina? - The president sends crew. - Are you here? - Oh, President Johnson. - Hi, Yale. We heard that you were on vacation. Did you just get back? - My blood-starved brain couldn't adapt quickly enough to answer their questions, so I said. - Yeah. - Is it still raining outside? - Yeah, no, I don't know. - You don't know, but you just came in from outside. - Why didn't I know if it was raining outside? So I said. - I didn't have my glasses on. - What? - I had no idea how to explain because all I could think of was, "I'm starving for the affection of your daughter, and I want nothing but the hug her and kiss her and never leave her side again, so please get out of the way." - Maybe I should check your eyesight. You know, you know, Yale, I've been meaning to ask you, don't you do something with computers? - Helicopter programming for Boeing. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Weren't you just leaving? - Oh, yeah. We were leaving, right, honey? - Okay, goodbye. - Bye, Mom. - Take care of this, will you? - I will. Thanks. - I'll check to see if it's raining outside. - Oh my God. I missed you so much. - What are you doing here? - I couldn't stay away from you. I just, I needed to be here. I'm a little wet. - I see that, but you almost blew it with my parents. - I'm sorry, I- - You don't know if it's raining. You're soaking wet. Oh my God. - My folks didn't know I'd started seeing Nina again. - I thought you were gonna take a little break. - So dad's feeling pretty chummy and wants to share this story with me. The moderate conservatives that parked the last public convention. Albany is putting his plans on the spot. - Yale, wait, wait. You remember I was so concerned about how I was gonna break this information to your brother? I just want you to know how I told her. Suppose I was to tell you that Yale was gonna marry a two-headed monster from outer space or a young shiksa from college or a Jewish widow with five children. Which would you choose? With blinking, she looked at me and said, "The two-headed monster." - Right, and that's in spite of my dad's child-rearing approach that was officially known as because I said so. - We've got it. Apollo 8 now in lunar orbit. There's a cheer in this room. This is Apollo Control Houston switching now to the voice of Jim Lovell. - While they had good intentions, their manner of intervening was way over the top. As a result, our relationship bounced back and forth between wonderful romantic moments and heart-wrenching breakups. I don't remember the exact order of events in the on again, off again rollercoaster ride that followed, but here are some of the highlights that took place over the following months. - This was both an on again and off again place for us, the Old Forge Inn. - All right guys, and I'll be right back with your food. - Thank you. - Hello. Would you care for a drink? - This was our Casablanca. - Oh, look. Look who's here. - They said the steaks are in? - Yeah, I think so, yeah. - Yeah, we ordered 'em. - Yeah, of course. - So. - I'll just go put your order in. I'll be right back. - Okay, thank you. Yeah. - Yeah, of course. Thank you. So it's gonna be- - I know I'm a little nervous. - Hey, are we flying solo tonight? - Slow tonight? - Well, I just got in, but it should probably pick up soon. - Count seems busy. - Are we jealous? - Oh, look who's here. How are you? - There's only room for one. - Oh. ♪ I just can't get enough ♪ - Now I'm the jealous one. ♪ This is too much ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ I'm over the moon ♪ ♪ And I'm so amused ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ You never thought it'd be ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ Until you crossed the line ♪ - Yale. Why do you never tell me you love me? - You should wake up. A daughter is a daughter all of her life, but a son is a son till he takes him a wife. - What's up, boy? How you doin'? - During our off again phase, we each visited the piano bar separately, asking if the other had been there. - Has Nina been here? - Yeah, she was here. - Was she alone? - Yeah, she was alone. - Was she sad? - Hmm, nah, she wasn't sad. But she asked where was you at? - And that was our routine. - Okay. You gotta get up. You gotta roll 'cause the Count's in the house. - But one night during an off period, Nina wasn't ready to make up. I was in a dark mood as I drove home. - Yes? - Nina, my car just slid off the road. I need to see you. - The car just went out of control. I don't know why. I mean, I'm fine, but the car's not. - Upstairs, and the guy bolted right after the shooting. - Excuse me. Hallerton's daughter. - You know, I'm not doing anything tomorrow night. - He's quite a little spitfire. - Now get the lab on this first thing in the morning. I want him to check it for anything unusual. - And? - A couple of months of hard work wasted. - Anything I can do? - Yeah. Tell me a joke. I could use a laugh right now. - Well, there was a police officer and these two detectives. - And then we were back on again. - Hmm, thank you. I really thought after all this time, you'd get better at this. - Do you have gin yet? - You just want me to win. - Hi, Yale. - Hey, kids. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you guys doing down here? You goin' to bed? - Yeah. - Okay. Are the kids already sleeping? - Yup. - Oh good. Everyone brushed their teeth? - Yes. - Can you guys give Mommy a kiss goodnight? - Sure. - Thank you. Thank you. Can you guys say good night to Yale, please? - Goodnight, Yale. - Goodnight. Sleep well. - I'll be up in just a minute, okay? Love you. - What's wrong? - Yale, I've been thinking. We've been fighting with your parents now for nine months. Even now, they don't know that we're even together, and meanwhile, we're miserable. We have to hide the way that we feel about each other because it makes other people uncomfortable, and I don't wanna do that anymore. Look, summer's almost over, okay? So why don't mean you go away together? Just the two of us on like a little vacation. - A vacation? - Yes, and it'll be great. I'll have it all planned, okay? I can make the arrangements. I'll have Clyde come stay with the kids. - Clyde? - I'll tell the kids that I'm going away with, I'm going away with Aunt Marilyn. - Aunt Marilyn? What? - Yeah, it'll be so perfect. But we deserve that little bit of happiness, don't we? - Yeah. - But there's something that I need you to do for me first. So I come from an era when single people don't just vacation together, okay? If you check into a motel, you better be carrying luggage, and you better be wearing a wedding ring. - You know, I really appreciate you coming out here with me, but I'm confused as to why we had to come all the way up to Allentown. - Well, this is the only pawn shop that I know of. - Well, when you said you would come with me, I figured you were pretty familiar with pawning things. - Yale, I never pawned a thing in my life. But don't worry, I know guys who did, all right? You wanted me to find you a pawn shops, so here we are. - All right, so how does this work? - Simple. You're just making a purchase, right? So you just ask the guy to see his stuff, and then you take it from there, okay? - Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me show you something. - These are Jacqueline Kennedy's pearls, the exact same pearls she wore in the oval office. These pearls cost her over $1,000. I'll sell them to you for 200. It would make a beautiful gift for your wife or fiance. - And was a pivotal concern during. - They're lovely, but I'm here to see wedding bands. - Wedding bands? - Inexpensive wedding bands if you want them. - That's not a problem. Caroline, show him some wedding bands. - The month that would close. - Hey fellas, how are you? - Hey. - We have a great assortment right here. What exactly are you looking for? - Take it easy on him. He just got out of college. - Okay. - I'm looking for something small and thin. - Okay. What size is she? You don't know her size? I'm guessing this is a surprise proposal? - Something like that. - Okay. - How about that one right there? Is there an inscription on it? - No, it's too thin for inscription, and that one won't turn her finger green. It's a good price. - I think this is yup, yeah. This is perfect. - Okay. - Thank you. - Tom. - I want us to start out with a clean slate. - Stop in a take a look at it. Hold on. Yeah! - Can you please clean it up for him, please? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Bob, can you clean this up for us? - I'm Jerry. - Hi Jerry. Ooh, sorry. - You like parties? - Do you see any others you like? - I think we're all set, actually. - Tom, are you done with that? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Do I like parties? - You ready, Yale? - Yeah. - That was weird. - Everything. We have everything? - Yes. - Okay. - We gotta hurry. I can't believe we're actually doing this. - I know. It's gonna be such a great time. - Just the two of us. - Yes, we do. - Oh! I forgot. Remember what you asked me? Oh, really? - Yes. - Thank you. My God, and it fits! - All right, time to go. Let's go. - Is this a proposal? - Not quite. Let's get going. - All right. - This is gonna be such a romantic getaway. - Just have to figure out what we're gonna do when we get there. I mean, there's probably plenty to do, right? - Oh, I'm sure. I can probably think of some things. - Probably. Did you bring the cards? - Yes, Yale. - Good, good. - Finally we were off, driving away and leaving all our cares behind. - It's beautiful weather, too. - I know, it's such a beautiful day. - Are you sure the kids are gonna be okay? - We drove up to Cape Cod to Provincetown. Provincetown is an artistic colony with a beautiful beach enhanced by a sea breeze. We wandered through the shops, admiring the crafts. We walked on the beach, looking for seashells and Cape Cod diamonds. - Perfect, perfect. Right there, right there. Yep. So yeah, you- - See all that? - Do you have any kids? - Right? Yeah. - No. - In the afternoon, we had our portraits painted as caricatures. - You have kids, for real? - Five kids, five. Five kids. - Five kids? One, three, four, five, for real? Voila. - Thank you! - I thought this must be what a honeymoon feels like. But we were star-crossed lovers, little knowing what fate had in store. I woke up early on our second day in paradise and went out to walk on the dunes. Overnight, the sand is washed cleaned by the tide, erasing all evidence of human footprints from the day before. That's when I got the inspiration to drag my feet and draw this huge valentine in the sand. Inscribed with the words Yale and Nina. While I was creating this ephemeral work of art, Nina got a phone call from our friend, Jerry. - Nina? - Is this Jerry? - Yeah, listen, I can't get ahold of Yale. - How did you find us? - Listen, Esther knows where you guys are at. - What? - All right, so you need to stop what you're doing and get back here as soon as possible. I can't cover for you guys anymore. - Wait, what do you mean? How does she- - I don't know, Nina. Look, I gotta go. - Oh God, okay. Oh my God. - That ended our trip to paradise. He called to tell us that my sister had pieced together our coordinated disappearance and called him threatening to tell the kids awful things about their immoral mother. - Hello? - Hey, Esther. - Yes, Jerry. - Hey, yeah. Yeah, listen, I just wanted to talk to you about Yale. Kind of worried about him. This girl Nina, she really got to his head. - Yeah, we were concerned about that. - Listen, they're both in Cape Cod together. I thought you should know. - What? Who else knows about this? - No one. I just thought you should know, huh? All right, look, you gotta keep this between us, okay? - I can't promise that, Jerry. I can't. - All right, I gotta go. Bye. - The seven-hour ride home was mostly filled with silence, each in our own thoughts of what do we do now? - You have that ring? - What ring? - The one that I gave you. Do you have it? I'm gonna need it back. - What? - Just give it back. - No, I- - Take it. - Nina. - Take your stupid ring. I don't want it. - Nina, will you come? - This time, Nina was at her wit's end. - Get away from me! - Will you wait, please? Just give me a second to- - Take your ring and go! - Nina, will you please- - Stop following me! - Nina, come here! Will you let me explain? I don't wanna give you a ring if it has no meaning to it. There's so many bad memories attached to it. - We can't keep doing this! Not when it involves my children. - The children? What do you mean the- - Breaking up with you is gonna kill me, but just so I can put you out of my life forever, I need you to tell me one thing. Tell me you don't love me. Just say it. Tell me you don't love me! Coward. Get out. - I couldn't say it, and so we were breaking up again. - In 1968 will determine not only the future of America. - Deciding that everyone else in the world would be better off if we could just learn to live without each other. - And the question that we answer tonight. Tonight, I again proudly accept that nomination for president of the United States. - I visited Nina a week later. I still hadn't figured out an answer for our relationship. - Hello? - But I needed to see Nina just to know she was okay. - Hey, Raymond. - Mom is unhappy all the time, and if you keep on breaking up with her because of us kids, I just want you to know I'll help. Just please don't break up with her again. - Raymond, our breaking up has never been because of you kids. But this is just a quick visit. I just wanna make sure your mom's okay. I'm not ready to come back just yet, but Raymond, I promise that you when I do come back, it'll be for keeps, okay? - Then what's real love, and how do I know if I've found it? - When you can't live without 'em. - I can't stand this. Any problem we'd have to face, I'd rather face it than face a life without Nina. I get it. This is true love. Don't make me explain it now, but I have to tell you this. I love you. I will find a way for us to live our lives together. But how do I proceed? - Problem solving technique number four, what would the hero do? Have you ever found yourself reading a book and this story has a difficult plot point for the main character and then he finds a solution and you love the way he worked out the problem? And you think to yourself, "Yeah, I'd like to think I do that, too. I admire that kind of character, and I'd love to be like him." So when I encounter a real-life problem, I pretend I'm reading about it in a book, and the solution comes to me right away. I know exactly what the hero of the book would do. In this case, he would resolve the problem directly, tackle it head on, do whatever it took. No more living life on the periphery, just observing and being philosophical. Instead, he jumped right in with both feet and confront the problem. And so I resolved to confront the problem directly. I made an appointment to get my head examined. - I have this problem. I love my family, but I love this woman. My family is dead set against us marrying each other. Let me explain the details. This woman, Nina is her name, she's almost 40, and she has five kids, five amazing kids that I love. And then there's my family on the other side, and they don't care. They don't feel that anything that I feel towards Nina is valid. They think it's wrong, and then there's me. Sometimes I think I'm insane. Sometimes I don't. Sometimes I wonder would it be better off without Nina, looking for someone my own age? But I always come back to I need her in my life, and that's it. It's all one great big problem. - Okay, look, you don't have one great big problem. You have two separate problems. One problem is your relationship with your parents. The other problem is your relationship with this woman. And you've got to find solutions to each of them separately. - Ah. - Listen, I'm not telling you to rush out and get married right now. I think there's still some things we need to work on, and you should come back next week, and I'll see you again. - Well, it seems like you know what you're talking about. So, okay. Here's the list of the concerns Nina and I resolved. Were were we ready to handle society's attitude about our age difference? Was I prepared to handle the challenges of a large family financially and emotionally? What were our thoughts on adopting another child? Would we want to have another child? How would we feel about each other in years ahead? Or how would our relationship affect the kids? - Well, I see our time is up for today, so let's schedule another session for next week. Well, what for? - Well, we'll continue to talk about this. - I don't understand why we'd have to do that. Look, the only reason I came here in the first place was I know that marrying a woman older than me with five kids is rather unusual. So it occurred to me maybe I'm insane, and if I'm insane, even if it makes sense to me, it may all be on irrational thinking. So I guess what I need to hear from you is am I crazy or not? Because if I'm not crazy, then there's no reason for me to continue seeing you. What I realized during the session is I spent the entire time explaining to you my rationale for wanting to marry Nina, and I know now, I don't need my parents' permission. And if I don't need their permission, then I don't need yours because I have it for myself. I can't keep coming back just for your approval because I have it in me. So just tell me this. Am I insane? - No, you're not insane. What you're planning to do is unusual, and it doesn't stand the best chance of being successful, but you're not insane. - Thank you very much. Our work is done. Hello? I'm here, and I know what I wanna do with my life. I wanna marry you. - For President Johnson, word. Will you marry me? - I'll have to think about it. - What do you mean you wanna think about it? Haven't you been thinking about it the entire time? - Well, you never asked me to marry you before, so I never had anything to think about. - Is this a joke? - No, you never asked me to marry you before, so now I need some time to think about it. - I'll give you five minutes. - No, ask me again tomorrow. Mm, I need a little more sugar. - Hi? - Hi. Want some coffee? - Yeah. Is that all you have to say? - You want some sugar in your coffee? - Isn't there something else you wanna tell me? Well, what's your answer? Will you marry me? - Yes! Of course, of course. - What took you so long? - I was giving you a chance, you know, in case you changed your mind. If you weren't gonna ask me again, well, I just wasn't gonna say anything. Oh, look at that dress. - I like that one. - Do you like that? Do you like that style? - Yeah, no, I like that a lot. - Oh, Raymond loves chocolate. What about that for a cake? - What about the rest of 'em? - Well- - We can't just give Raymond what he wants alone. - Well, I mean, I'm just thinking, "What would they want?" You know it's... Oh, what about that little bow tie for David? Oh my God. - He'd look great. - That would be so sweet. - He'd look great. - What about the girls, though? Do you think they'd wanna wear a matching outfit, - They may have something more in the middle. - wanna match Mommy? - Aw. Oh, that's cute. - Maybe. - Okay. - Mona will probably like that. But, you know, with everything going on, I think there's something we probably need to consider. With everything that's been going on, I just feel like, I don't know if we should invite your parents to our wedding. I'm starting to think it might just be easier if we just eloped. - No, no. I will not let my parents drive us to live our lives contrary to the way we ordinarily would. We will have a wedding, and we will invite whoever we want. If they decide not to come, then it's on them. And if they do come and behave poorly, then I'll escort them out. But we will have a healthy relationship with my parents by behaving normally. - Okay then. How about we do this? We have a small wedding here and then just invite immediate family, and two weeks later, we'll do a reception, and we'll invite all our friends. - Okay, makes sense. I like that idea. We'll do that. I'll drive up to Hazleton tomorrow and tell the parents our plans. - Oh! Oh, look at that. Did you see that? - Esther called for my recipe for lamb pie, so I'm looking at up here. Oh, look at this! Oh, look at this. That's a lamb chop with mint jelly. Would you like something like this, Sid? Look who's here. What's the occasion, dear? - Mom, Dad, I'm here to announce our plans and invite you to our wedding. - What? I thought you were breaking up. Now out of the blue, you come here and tell us you're getting married? - Dad, I didn't drive up here to fight. I made my decision, and I'm here to invite you to the wedding. - Who do you think you are? What kind of nonsense is? - Dad, I'll discuss whatever you wanna talk about, but if you continue yelling at me, I will leave. - This is my house, and I am the boss, and you will hear me out! - I'm not kidding. I'll talk with you if you talk with me, but if you continue yelling at me- - Well, we'll just see about that! - That's it. - Sid, Yale! Sid! I can't watch this. - Come back here now! Back here right now, Yale! Do you hear me, son? I wanna talk to you! Talk to me right now! - I will not come near you when you're screaming like that. - I'd like to crack your head open and pour some sense into it. - Dad, if you just stop yelling, I'll come back into the house, and we can talk. - There should be no confusion. - You promised me you'd see a psychiatrist. - As a matter of fact, I did. - And? And what did he say? - He said I'm not crazy. - Well, then you went to the wrong doctor. You go to the doctor I tell you to. - No, Mom. t doesn't work like that. - I can't believe you think so little of your very own family that you would choose her over us! - Well, who made that rule? Definitely not me! I want Nina and I want the family. Wait a minute, I can't believe you love me so little as to think that my choosing Nina, I'm giving up the family! I choose Nina and the family, and that's my rule. - We held the wedding in Nina's home. - Nina, I love you so much. You look so beautiful. - We held our breath, wondering what my parents might do. But they behaved. - Frank, ew! Stop sweating and stand up straight, for God's sakes. You think they would at least decorate. I mean, it's cute, simple. My sister's a simple kind of girl, you know. When I married my Donald, we pulled out all the stops. Or was that my Richie? I don't know. What I'm trying to say is you just can't put a price tag on to love. Sh, it's starting. - You have a place in the Jewish community. Treasure that place and make that place worthy of your heritage. Remember that, especially when you conclude the ceremony by stepping on the glass, that it's a new beginning. - If this marriage lasts six months, I'd be shocked. - May the Lord bless you and watch over you. May God be gracious unto you, and may His light shine upon you. May God always look at you, and may He give you peace. With your right foot, step on the glass. Mazel tov. - Mazel tov! - Dad even filmed the affair. But afterwards, he told me he didn't realize till we got home that there was no film in the camera. 25 years later when I was transferring mom's home movies from film to video tape, guess what I found? Our wedding. - You look lovely. Welcome. - Thank you. Glad you could come. - Nina, you know, it could've been me and you. - Oh, are you hitting on a married woman, - Never. - sir? - Jerry, you know better. - Let's do a turn. - Aw. - Ooh! - Oh, okay. - You're so beautiful, Nina. - Okay. - Woo! I dropped my yamaka. - But then the evening closed in the sweetest way. - All right, ready for bed? - Goodnight, Daddy. - Goodnight, David. - No, you must say, "Goodnight, son." - Goodnight, son. - And I thought, "What do I do now?" But this time, the answer was easy. I enjoy the rest of my life.
