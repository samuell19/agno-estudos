Don't move. Dude! Hey! It's all right. Look at me, look at me, come on, come on! Who sent you? The Chinese? Was it the Chinese, you son of a bitch? Was it the Chinese? Was it the Chinese? Was it the Chinese, you son of a bitch? You're a tough bastard, aren't you. So you won't talk? Son of a bitch! Hey, man, this one's got a pulse. One, two, three. One, two, three. Km 52, traffic accident. We found a male and a female, both lifeless. Sole survivor taken to 25 de Mayo Hospital for further aid. Thoracic trauma, presents leakage, in state of shock. Degrees 12 and 15. ...for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins For we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not... Why? Dad... She told you, didn't she? Damián, stop. Damián, look out, you'll get us killed! Hello, what happened to him? -Blood relative? -Yes, I'm his aunt. Good evening, I'm Dr. Aristizábal Look, the patient had a nervous breakdown, okay? He's stable now, but on sedation. May I see him? Yes, but remember he's still recovering from suggestive amnesia, so... He's confused and won't remember some things. But he's going to be alright, isn't he? Yes, he will be, after some time. Don't you worry. -See you later. -See you. How do you feel? Damián! So how long till you get the real diploma? A year from now. Mariano, could you turn the sound off? Nice place, spacious. Dad'll be going to the factory in an hour. He could've showed up, at least for the graduation ceremony. He would have, if it were him receiving it. Damián! I'll be right back! Look after your brother! My God. My God, no. Boys! What happened? Damián, where are you? Mariano! Boys! Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow, honey. Son, are you going to eat at all? Damián? The food is ready. -The food is ready, come on. -I'm coming. He dodges the two Boca fullbacks, hits the ball with his left foot and scores... Look at that. How much suffering. Did you finish the project? No, I have a lot left to do. But tomorrow I'll see the guys and I think I'll finish it by then. They're always looking for engineers at dad's factory. Isn't that right, Miguel? Oh, tomorrow I will meet my fellow unionists. I'll ask Romero to name you Secretary to the Delegate. Once you are in, the rest is easy. Awesome. That's great. They are airing the match again. My god. They want to make me suffer. Damián, be careful, you'll get us killed! Damián! Why does he treat me like this? What? Dad. Why does he treat me like this? He hates me, mom. That's not true. Why is dad so ugly towards me? It's not like that, you know how dad is. It has nothing to do with you. Watch where you're going, please! Stop! -Damián, stop! -Stop the car, please! What's wrong with you? You're going to kill us all! Damián, it's enough. Enough of what? Tell me why he treats me like that. Tell me the truth, why is he like that to me? Please. Please, stop the car, Damián. Are you gonna tell me why he treats me that way? -Stop, now. -No, I won't stop. Why does he treat me that way? -Stop now, please! -Why does he treat me that way? For fuck's sake, why does he treat me that way? What? Miguel is not your real dad. Your real dad is called... They call him The Rooster. After killing someone in a fight, he fled and left me. Later, I learned I was pregnant. I was so young... I was alone. I didn't know what to do. And then dad appeared. He approached me... He said that it didn't matter that you were The Rooster's son. That he was going to put his name in your birth certificate. That he was going to raise you as his own son. And that's what he did. He said that when you were older, we were going to tell you the truth. When you could understand. But later? After the incident with the gun... Dad changed his mind. He said that we would never tell you the truth. Never. He said: "He has The Rooster's blood... And if he finds out he is his son... He will turn into a killer just like him." Damián! The food is ready! Damián! Damián... Are you feeling okay? Did you hear me? I was falling asleep. I was asking you if you wanted to come and eat. No, my stomach hurts. Anything leaving now for Villa Ruiz? 11:30 pm is the next one. Okay. Round trip? No, one way. Do you like roosters? I could tell you a lot about roosters. Especially about mine. He's fierce and deadly like no other. See this watch? I won it with him. Roosters are nice, but of course... Everything is a matter of ideology, isn't it? PETROL Come in kid, come in. Go on. Come on Come inside. I will send for the girls, kid, come on. What are you doing here, kid? What's the matter? -What's this? -My mom. Your mom? Lemme see. Ah... Have a seat. You're all grown up! I said sit down, I don't bite, kid! Take this. And don't worry, your mom wasn't a whore. Look, I'll tell you about it. Lorena was waiting for the bus at the post office one day The owner of this place saw her She offered her a job and brought her here, you see? But she did the cleaning. She never mingled with us. Do you know The Rooster? Of course, how couldn't I know The Rooster? The Rooster also was here since he was a kid. Want one? Anyway. The point is The Rooster's mom was a great friend of Isabel But she died when the kid was really young So Isabel raised him as her own. Do you know where to find him? No, The Rooster... Lemme think... About 25 years, more or less, since he left town. I dunno... Oh, kid, kid... Hear me out... Look, The Rooster was a good kid. Quiet. He had a bit of a temper But I think it was because of the company he kept Isa didn't like those kids one fucking bit Then... He started seeing Lorena. And that settled him quite a bit. I really thought they would last, but no... They didn't... Drink! They were dating? Oh, they were really into it! But... It was a secret. Were they together for a long time? No. One night at The Yacaré, there was this big fight... It appears Lorena had a few secret admirers. The Rooster had quit going there since they started dating, so when he saw him again, Gutiérrez started mocking him. Alcohol started to go round very fast When all of the sudden, one of them says "Lorena is a whore and I'll go to the whorehouse and fuck her!" Without saying a word, The Rooster... stabbed him. They say The Rooster started the fight, but I don't think so He was a good kid, you know? He wouldn't back down But he was a good kid. Lorena was devastated, poor girl, broke my heart... And, know what? I knew right away that the girl was pregnant. Well, she vanished a month later. I thought she'd left with The Rooster, but no... She left to Rosario with the stabbed guy's cousin. -Miguel? -Yes, Miguel! Yes. About a year later, I think, The Rooster came back. He was looking for her. He was obsessed with her. And when he heard she'd gone to Rosario with this man, he disappeared for good. He never showed his face again. Don't you know where I could find him? Anywhere? No, kid, no. Not a clue. But I think I can help you anyway. Look, about two or three years ago... A kid dropped by. He was called Facundo. He had The Rooster's motorbike. When I saw it, I recognized it right away because it was beautiful. It had an embossed rooster. Such a beauty. So I told him: "Kid, that bike ain't yours". And he told me... That he got it from The Rooster, who was working for him. What kind? God only knows. And do you know where can I find Facundo? No, but lemme think... He said he was from the West. You should go and look for that bike in the West. But hear me out about this, kid. If you go looking for him... Be very careful. I have a bad feeling about him. NAME Did you hear? Full name and phone number. How many nights? One. Eighty bucks. Room 212. Stairs, at the end, to your right. Look out! Excuse me. Hold on. Do you know somewhere people... Hang out at night? It depends. It depends on what? On what you're looking for. What's up? Having a walk, champ? Need some help? You're looking for something, champ. Aren't you? No, nothing. No, I'm not looking for anything. I'm just trying to help you, champ. I see that you're looking for someone. -I'm looking for a guy named Facundo. -Who? A guy named Facundo who has a chopper bike -with a rooster on the gas tank. -Yeah. -Do you know him? -Yes... I can find him for you. Thing is: I have to bribe some pimps, some cops... And then... Hold on a sec. What's up? Dude... Tell me. Tell me, it's fine, I'm listening. I already told you, I'm looking for this Facundo guy. Yeah. And he has a chopper bike with a rooster on it. I know him, champ. Gimme... half an hour and I'll bring him. Word. I have to pull some strings, okay? I'll pull some strings and I'll bring him right away. I just need... some change. You got some change? I don't have much on me. Why are you giving me that look? I ain't mugging you. -Look, I-- -How much do you want? I don't have change, gimme some coins, I don't know. -I don't know. -It's ok, give me this, champ. Give me the money and that's it, champ. Don't worry. -Give back my wallet! -Hey, trust me, champ. Trust me for a second, champ! For fuck's sake, chill! Okay? Champ! Where were you, dude? I told you to trust me. Moron. Around the corner, there's the bike with the rooster. Facundo will be at the bar. How can I tell it's him? -Whatcha want? -A beer. Thing is... You gotta be smart, you know? You gotta think. Because if you leave the guy's ankle on the ground, the blood keeps flowing and the guy doesn't die, it takes a couple of days, you know? We were with Tito... We were waiting for Tumba. Tumba wouldn't come, so we were worried. "Where's Tumba? Where's Tumba?" Tumba then arrives and asks for a hit. I say to him: "Tumba... you weren't followed, right?" "No, no one ever follows me!" "Oh, so no one ever follows you?" I smelled something fishy. Know how I realized? He's a nigger. But a nigger in here. That kind of nigger, when they lie, you can smell it on them. "So no one followed you? How did you get here?" I said: "Let's go to sleep, that's it!" "I'm fed up, lets go to sleep, everyone!" "Tumba, you're sleeping on my bed" "No, not--" "You're sleeping on my bed!" "You're sleeping on my bed!" As I never sleep, I stay cool, and lay on the bottom bed, watching. So, these three big Chinese guys come in. One goes to my bed and bang, bang! Shoots Tumba's legs, So I start shooting them, bang, bang! I got him in the chest, "Let's get the Chinese!" One falls down the stairs and dies. So I grab the last one and say: "C'mere, you fucking chink" "Me no understand" he said. "Ticket, ticket!" "Me no understand" "Ticket, ticket!" "Oh, so you don't understand? C'mere" "Don't kill me, please". "Oh, now you understand". "Now you understand?" They're unbelievable, they play the fools. So I said to him: "Calm down, I won't kill you". That's what I told him. On the third day, he was begging me: "Please... kill me". Fucking chink. They're all the same. -A beer, please. -Right away. What the fuck you looking at? -What the fuck you looking at? -Facundo, calm down. Ok, it's cool, it's cool. I got it, I got it. It's okay. Give my friend here a beer. I was going to tell you, please stop, Damián. -Damián, stop! -Damián stop the car so we can talk! No, Damián, no! What's your name? Do you know who you are? Is anybody there? I need to go to the bathroom! I have to go to the bathroom, is anyone there? I didn't do anything! Why do you keep me here? I want to go to the bathroom, I won't escape, I'm hurt. Is anyone there? I'm not going to escape. If you do or say something inappropriate.. I'll shoot you in the head. Okay? Come on. Let's go. Take your clothes off. When you're done, put on the blindfold. Hello, Facundo? He was almost dead... How long has he been here? No, no, he can barely speak. What do I do? Take him out? Are you really sure he was following you? He doesn't really look like the kind of guy to... Ok, but hurry up, he won't last much longer. Yeah... You think that he's with the Chinese? Ok, he will last until you arrive, but if things get complicated, I'll kill him. Open your mouth. Eat. I went to the bar because my dad told me-- Shut up and eat. Come on. That I killed my mom and brother. That I'm a killer. And I can't remember what happened. I have images... Lost images, but I don't remember what happened that night. In the beginning, I thought it was better not to know. After that, the doubt made me crazy, it was really affecting me. And then... I don't know where I got the idea that I had to find The Rooster. He was a friend of my mom's... When she was young, in Ruiz. How was your mom called? Lorena. Lorena Arredondo. Mariano! Damián! Wash your hands, come on! Where could they be? Here you are... Excuse me... Can I have look? How may are there? There's a lot of them. And is it true that now grandpa is there? Yes, it's true. And, how is it? It's a beautiful place... Full of light. They say it's a place where all your wishes come true. You have to pick up this kid, I have to leave now. Kilometer 57. Hurry up. You're welcome. Don't leave! Are you The Rooster? Please, tell me, are you The Rooster? I'm leaving. Please, you have to help me. I need to see your face. No, I'm leaving. Please, take the blindfold off. Don't leave. If you see my face, I'll have to kill you. I'm not asking you to set me free. I have to remember what happened to me. I need to see your face. Then, you can kill me if you want to, but I need to see your face. Trust me. So? How's the girl? She doesn't complain. And how are you? Better than the ones who did me this. Was it the Chinese? Yes. It was the Chinese. The kid's there? And what do we do with this one? What do I do with you, brat? I'm not interested in knowing who you are anymore. I'm gonna have to kill you. But he doesn't know a thing, right? Anyway, it's too late, he already knows who I am. But you won't say a thing, will you? You won't! Because if you say anything... I'll deal with you... And then I'll hunt down your family and kill them one by one. One by one. And you! You're leaving without celebrating that I'm back safe and sound? -No. -No! -He's tied up tight, right? -Yes Then there won't be any issues! No! Well, time to eat. Stand up, come on! Hold on. That's it. What's the matter? Is he gone? Yes, he's gone. But when he comes back... I'll do the same thing to him. Do you think I'm a dumb-ass? Do you think I'm a dumb-ass? Did you think I wouldn't notice? Of course I would, do you know who I am? Come here! Where are you? I will find you! Here you are! Come here, you son of a bitch! What were you going to do to me? You where taking me down? Huh? Answer, you fag! How do you know The Rooster? Answer me! You were going to take me down? Huh? You mother fucker! Come on, shoot! Come on, you sissy! Shoot! You gotta have guts... to kill. Are you a killer or not? Damián! Everything will be okay... Come on, shoot! Do you know how to kill? No. You drive. Shoot! Come on, you sissy! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Son! It's over. You'll be fine, ok? It's over, my boy. It's over. It's over. Don't fall asleep. I'm taking you to the hospital. Everything is gonna be fine. Don't fall asleep, please. Don't fall asleep.
