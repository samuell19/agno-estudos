What medicine overdose? I will file a case on hospital and close this hospital We are sorry Doctor get some juice There’s no one proper here They have made me look old Calm down Yuva Have some juice Yuva Take rest now Sleep In another 10min he’ll be fine Take care of him I have been treating him since two years Whenever he comes to reality He keeps questioning how I became old And what happened to my face Then what ever I heard and typed was Just an imagination story According to my point of view its imagination But on his point of view it’s a fact fiction On the 2 year study on his brain and nerves I have prepared how his brain works and thinks Stalin! he was the one who was killed by Yuva! Stalin! Please take your seats Chandini They are the main characters whom Yuva has Recorded in his memory According to him, he has murdered Stalin Inspector how was Yuva behaving with you? And enquired about Rashmika Then I had been to his place After that i went to his house and explained about those 2 cases... While going back for the first time I met doctor After 3 months in station... I was discussing this issue with him Careful sir, my boss need those files... He went missing when I finished talking to These guys Case file was shattered on the table I had a doubt Sorry Yuva Rashmika died due to Car accident DNA and FORENSIC report shows the same thing Accident, why can’t it be rape and murder? May be a chance right ? Yes sir Whenever he met me Did you get information about Rashmika? No I don’t know anything about Rashmika Take this If you get any information about Rashmika call me He gave money to my guy and asked him to kill me How come he is still alive? I had killed him I have no connection with him But, Someone is so important has been missing Please pray I get them back soon I found it weird After I met SI sir then I came and met you On a minute changes on him, we can Come to know if he is normal or abnormal Am really not interested in all these For me money is time and time is money See you What might be the reason behind it? Neuron network The functioning of our brains and cells Inside the brain To encode the feelings and send signals in and out Is the function of these hundred billion neurons Brain produces number of feelings, emotions and Knowledge All these depend on our neurons system If something gets damaged in this part of area Then there’s an attack of Schizophrenia Loneliness, anger and feeling scared are probably The first person who are attacked by this And also all these are hyper level The chances are higher We usually forget the small things but people suffering From Schizophrenia they act according to it They create their own imagination world They live inside this world It’s similar to Yuva He hasn’t seen me Just because you said you’ll send Chandhini He imagined her Who is Chandhini who existed in his subconscious mind? When he was 11 years He lost his parents in a car accident Only Yuva and his driver were saved in the accident Where is my dad and mom ? Yuva leave it I had a doubt on the same day I thought it was a phobia Later I realized Then who is Anjali? She is also Nurse in my team She was his personal care taker She always came for a night 12'O clock shift Anjali..did you gave food ? Okay sir So Anjali’s character started existing there His mind has been travelling everywhere Doctor how is he recognizing all of them? Yes, it’s surely difficult in other cases But in Yuva case god has helped us People whom he loves and hates He would sketch pictures of them After I decoded all of it I started understanding So there’s no medicine for this? There are few experiments to be done on him For now it’s possible only with doctors For now it’s possible only with doctors There’s a medicine for him What? I will make him alright Yes sir [Sanskirth word ] I will be a god to him What are you saying? Yes sir I will make him alright It’s very impossible to change him It's very difficult to find that formula But it requires an honest heart The day I researched on this I felt something was missing You kept observing him like a patient but you Never observed his innocence Yuva needs love and care I will give him that love and care I will give him that love and care And make him alright As a doctor or daughter? As a human I will make him fine Dad, as long as Rashmika stayed in his life Wasn’t he fine? When he started searching his past That is when he pressurized himself And that affected his neuron system That is when his hormone level came down And Schizophrenia increased His emotions came out through music People around him just saw what was missing in him But what he actually wanted no one knew Everyone looks for brightness when there are in dark But the Doctors should look for more brightness in the brightness But in Yuva’s case something is possible Doctor Hey Yuva You bloody MBBS You proved again You’re just a fake doctor Why dint you tell me about my health? Why dint you tell me be myself? You please have patience We are all with you I won’t kill anyone, instead I will Kill myself I knew where my Rashmika is I will go there Listen to me Yuva Look at me Won’t you listen to your childhood friend? You always stole my lollipop Do you remember? Don’t come close I have Schizophrenia Who told you that? This doctor He is a fake doctor Really Promise Yes he is fake, that’s why he is with these culprits Come on Yuva There’s nothing wrong, am there with you I will be there with you Come let’s go Doctor
