(somber music) (crowd chatter) - I've always wondered where the story that they came up with actually came from. You know, where did it all begin? And I wish I had an answer for you but I really don't all I can do is speculate, you know. (dramatic music) Okay. So it's not gonna take long. - [Woman] Whenever you're ready. - Okay ready. My name is Anna Vasquez, I'm 37 years old, and I was born and raised in San Antonio Texas. The neighborhood was pretty decent even though I did live on the west side of town, which is not a very, I don't know, rich part of San Antonio. But in that particular neighborhood it was okay. It wasn't as bad as some of the other parts of San Antonio is. I came out probably about 18 to my mother. I'm sure she had some kind of idea, you know, not going out with boys. But openly I came out about 18, about 18. When you want your children to grow up you want them to grow up being loved, not being stared at or mocked or looked at in disgust. And growing up as an open gay women, you get that, and you got that a lot in San Antonio, you know. San Antonio's very conservative. And my lifestyle wasn't accepted at the time. - And this is when she was a baby. Basketball, graduation. And this is when we went to Corpus Christi and they took a picture of us together. See, there's me and that's her. She was always trying to improve herself. Um, let me see. She graduated and she started college. She dropped out because of the money and then she started working at Little Caesar's and she was gonna be going back to college after that. - When I met Anna she was at work and we ordered some pizza from her. So we did that, I saw her, she saw me, and after that I think we took interest in each other. We just stared talking. And then since we were in San Antonio we would go to the carnivals and we all decided to go and that night we were just stuck to each other. That's what started our relationship. She kissed me that night and it was over. But it was all new to us so we weren't really out and about. I mean I had just left my ex-husband and my babies were very, very little, my son and my daughter were young. So I didn't even know what I was doing, I didn't know if that was the lifestyle that I was gonna be in. We spent a lot of time together and we ended up really caring for each other. - [Woman] Get closer together guys, a little kiss. There you go. - Happy birthday. She was just the one that I was gonna settle down with. - [Anna] I truly feel like Cass and I were one, were one together you know. We fell in love, you know, and we moved in together, we were living with the children and raising them. Something I wasn't ready for, but I also took it on. I mean we, you know, we were good, we were good to each other. - These two kids had two mothers. They took responsibility, very responsible parents. I mean if you could call them that, you know I mean they're not married or anything but. They were totally devoted to each other. You know just like a husband and wife. I did ask a priest about that once. I asked him, you know, what am I supposed to do? She's my daughter and she's involved with this other lady. What am I supposed to do? Am I being faithful, in order to be faithful to the church do I have to be, you know, apart from my daughter or separated from my daughter? And he said no. He said the only thing that is required of you is to love her, that's all. He said, she's going to be receiving a lot of negatives in the world, you know, she's gonna come against this prejudice. There should be one place where she can go where there is only love. - My mom, when she found out that me and Anna were in a relationship, she wasn't happy about it, you know, so. Our families are very Catholic, they're very religious. Well my mom, you know, she called me a lot of ugly names. That was hard. And as far as my family accepting, I couldn't go home and be who I was. So we ended up spending a lot of time with Liz at her apartment. - [Anna] Liz is the one that's kind of like our home away from home I guess. - [Cassie] We spent a lot of time together. And I remember the week that it supposedly happened her nieces were there. But we never thought anything of it. - [Anna] I met Liz through my best friend Jolene. We all went to high school together. And Kristie I had met years later through Liz and Cassie as well. When I came in, we all became friends. - Liz has her own apartment and I was living there with her helping her pay the bills. She was dating some other guy. Matter of fact she was pregnant. She was basically on her own getting ready to raise a child. I was trying to help her out as much as I could. At one period of time we did date for a minute, Liz and I, for like a couple months. (women chattering) - I lived in the projects in the San Juan homes in San Antonio. My mom was in housing, so pretty much that's where I grew up in. I met Anna Vasquez in high school, played basketball and volleyball and that's how I met all of them. I had just pretty much found out I was pregnant, that's when Javier had came by the apartment. And Javier of course is my sister's ex-husband. I told him that I was pregnant and at that time he was like, I can take care of him. I was like, no the baby has a father. And that's when he asked me, well why don't you just let me marry you and take care of you. And I was like no, no. You know, for one I didn't grow up that way, you know I had morals and values. And that was my sister's ex-husband and what would I look like doing anything like that? I don't know what the custody thing between them, how he got ahold of the kids. At that time he had come to the apartment that day. He was like, the girls wanna stay, and I was like, okay that's fine. I've always been family oriented, I think family is very important. So I've always supported everyone in my family or been around them or anything, so they were apart of that. You know it was a normal, natural family thing. You go pick up your nephews and nieces and you hang out, they stay with you, things like that, it's a normal life. - These four young women were taking care of two little girls for about a week. The two little girls were the nieces of one of them, of Liz Ramirez. And a couple of months after these little girls had spent a week, allegations were made that the four young women had gang raped these two little girls over a period of two days. - I actually got a phone call one night from a Detective Majetka and he was a detective for the homicide unit. And he called and he said that some allegations were being made by these two children and what I had to say about it. - Detective Majetka takes me down to the substation. He's like, do you know Javier Limon? Do you know Vanessa Limon and Stephanie Limon? And I was like, yes those are my nieces and that's my brother in-law. Do you know that they are saying that you sexually assaulted them? And I was like, no, I didn't know that. We had talked about me being pregnant and how he can take my baby away from me and all these things. And I'm just like, for what? You know I haven't done anything. Why would any of this come about from that? - When this happened, Anna, she was the one that came and told me because she'd found out about it. When she first mentioned it, I thought that she was only saying that Liz was being accused of it. But then she turned around and said that we were also and I lost it. - I let him know off bat that I was a homosexual 'cause he had asked, I said yes. I willingly cooperated with them. I don't feel like anything in my statement was bad or you know, incriminating for me, so. - You believe as you're growing up that if you tell the truth everything's gonna be fine. A couple people told me, you need an attorney. Why would I need an attorney? I'm innocent, there's nothing, you know, that ever happened. So I went ahead and cooperated with them and it seemed to turn out to be a mistake. The biggest mistake, you know. I cooperated fully and it seems like I just dug deeper. - After I had my little boy, about three days later I believe is when they came and arrested me and took me to the county jail. I used to tell my mom, well these people think these things about me and I'm even scared to hold my baby. - It was, it was sad. It was sad. We tried to have a good time, you know, and I think it was about two years before she even went to trial. So I mean we had celebrations and everything, but there was always underlying sadness that this was gonna come up. And so it was for them. It was like that for them also, you know. (dramatic music) - My attorney had told me, you know Liz they don't have anything on you, there's nothing, you know. Wanted to let me know I didn't really have anything to worry about. He didn't tell me what we were gonna do, what are our plans, anything like that. All I went in there and sat there and just went through the trial. When I first came out as far as my lifestyle was, my mom had disowned me. So she gave me my papers and went to the courthouse and said she was no longer responsible for me. I believe I was 16 at the time. I went to go stay with my sister. They were taking care of me as far as giving me money for school and buying clothes and things like that. - I did know many years ago that when she was staying with him and her sister, which is his wife at the time, that he was coming on to her, and we were in high school. And my thing to tell her was, you need to get out of there. - I had letters that he would write. He would say, my little angel. I had given them to my attorney, you know, the originals. I never had any contact with him though. We never kissed, embraced, anything like that. He knew I was with women at the time too, you know, and that's one thing he didn't like. - I don't think Javier knew the extent of Liz and I's relationship, I don't think he did at first. I think he thought we were just friends. He was shocked when he found out I think, surprised. And I know he didn't like it, he didn't like it at all. Our attorney's decided to put all us three together and go one shot. Cassie, Anna, me, we all went to trial together. - My attorney said that I would lose. He said that I would lose because of the charges, the charges. Nobody wants to go against a child. But he said that I would fight. He's like, I will fight for you if that's what you choose to do. So we fought. - [Debbie] Even during jury selection defense lawyers had trouble finding jurors that weren't homophobic. - [Cassie] Our lifestyle was not supposed to be brought up. But they brought it up anyway, the DA did. - The DA was trying to make us look like we were just a bunch of lesbians. That, that was a thing that we did, you know, molest little girls. So that's how from the get go they made the jurors, you know, put that in their head. - When I heard the children testify against me I was shocked. I was baffled, I couldn't believe it. They said that they were screaming and that we were inserting objects into them. And the things that they say we did, I just can't even imagine. - [Cassie] When I heard the testimony of Vanessa Limon during that time when she was sitting there, I was just in shock. I didn't even know what to think or feel, I was just like I couldn't believe it. It's like she was just throwing things out there. - [Anna] The testimony that was given was off the wall. You know it was one gun here, three guns there. Then there was a knife involved. There was so many mistakes. - They were caught in so many inconsistencies and they were questioned constantly about Liz's trial, you know, it's against ours. - I had asked Anna to come into the station so I could take a Polaroid. - [Man] Did he not tell you that you had a right to an attorney? - No sir. It was just so easy for this case to evolve around an accusation without any concrete testimony. - Really the only evidence against the four women was the word of these two little girls. The jury, I don't think, would've been able to convict if they hadn't had the so-called medical evidence. Both of the little girls had been taken to a facility where they were examined. The pediatrician who examined them said that there were certain features on their genitals, on their hymens that indicated that they'd been sexually abused. Shapes of the hymen, little notches on the hymen, tiny, tiny things. For about 15 years prior to this case, a body of knowledge had developed about what children's genitals should look like. These little girls genitals did not look like the model that had been developed and that was supposed to show that they'd been abused. That kind of evidence put before a jury is very powerful 'cause it's physical evidence. - Ah man, he really went after Liz like nobody. Got in her face. He was horrible, he was horrible. He was horrible, he was very prejudiced. Prejudiced against, I guess, her being gay. Painted as a witch, you know. - [Liz] He was trying to say because we were four women and that, that the way supposedly the girls were assaulted that we were trying to sacrifice them because of our lifestyle. - According to the people in court this is what gay people do. That's what they said. This is what gay people do. No, no it's not. (dramatic music) - I never did anything besides take care of those children and try to be a good aunt to them. I don't even know, I can't even, 16 years later I still can't even tell myself. You ask me the question why, I don't have an answer to that. - [Cassie] 'Cause Elizabeth was sentenced to 37 and a half years they wanted us to take a plea bargain. And we wouldn't take it. We were like, no we didn't do nothing, we're not gonna do that. - [Kristie] I felt like the whole trial, I felt like my sexual orientation with me and the rest of us, it was used against us. - There was homophobia in the police department, among the investigators. There was homophobia in the trial. And there was homophobia in the whole city. - I was convicted and given 15 years for sexual assault of a child. And I was also given 10 years for indecency with a child. - [Woman] See how run down it is? - [Debbie] One of them, Liz Ramirez, was already in prison. But the other three were still out on appeal. They were desperately still trying to get exculpatory evidence. - [Anna] Nobody was gonna help us, so we had to help ourselves. So we tried going back to the apartment. - [Anna] But those apartments were torn down. - One of the children said that there was a a lock where you she couldn't undo to get out of the house. There wasn't a lock where they couldn't reach. - It's outrageous. Just being innocent, you wanna prove, you wanna do everything you can. It was just let down after let down, 'cause there wasn't nothing we could do. - To my great shame parental support for all the girls involved was not existent because we parents did not understand or support their lifestyle. So these four young women, barely out of high school were struggling to help their friend Liz. - We reached out to the gay community. Unfortunately we reached out a little too late. - And if we can't make a change, they're gonna spend the next 15 years of their life in prison because they're lesbians. - I thought if other people heard they would understand and relate to us. We just wanted people to hear our story 'cause it was unbelievable. In closing arguments they made a statement saying, well the defendants are gay, that is why the victims are female. Just because this is the way we want to be, does not mean that we are perverts. And that is the way so many people look at us. During then, we were just trying to live life. It was real hard knowing that those were gonna be our last memories with families. Ah he's gonna be handsome. Look at me. - [Anna] Even though the charges were devastating to us, it brought us together. - They were very young, but I would still tell 'em that there was a possibility I was leaving, you know, and that they would have to stay with my mom. My kids were very, very close to Anna as well. They asked if they could stay with her. She was coming to, so I had to explain that to them. (waves crashing) I was so young before I got locked up. We all were. (somber music) - [Anna] My dearest Cass. I leave you now for the next 13 years to suffer in a cage. To conform to the codes and rules of prison life. To feel fear everyday. I leave you Cass sweet and innocent and soon you fueled with rage will change. We've been devastated my love. I'm sorry that I won't be there to protect you inside these prison walls. - [Police Officer] Turn around, hands behind your back. - [Man] Be strong girls. We're still fighting for you. We're not gonna give up. We know you're innocent, we know. - [Anna] I love you Cassie. - [Cassie] I love you. - [Man] We know you're innocent Anna, we're gonna fight. Be strong. - [Cassie] We are devastated. I mean this is like the most horrible crime you can accuse somebody of. - God, I'm dying. I'm dying 'cause I cannot believe that this has actually gone on this far and I'm going to spend 15 years of my life in prison for a crime that I never committed. It's very hard to swallow. It's very hard to not think, let's just leave, you know. Let's just go. But at the same time, if I did run, how would that look? - Satanic cults, satanic ritual abuse has become the fastest growing and most controversial psychological phenomenon in the country. It's a modern twist to an ancient story. - Investigated their world of covens and sacrifices. - In the United States starting the early 80's until the early 90's, the country was convulsed with this idea that there were, there was some kind of an international satanic cult that had infiltrated daycare centers and preschools and that their mission was to sexually abuse children in order to destroy their minds. And then later on when the kids would be adults, somebody would like snap their fingers and all of a sudden these kids would line up and join the cult. As completely insane as this sounds, this belief got into child protection services, it got into police departments, it got into psychotherapy. - [Debbie] It got into DA's offices. Scores of people were convicted who were just working in daycare centers and preschools on the basis of no conventional evidence whatsoever. - I never, never, never did it. I never did, I never did. - [Woman] Okay Vi, okay. - [Debbie] I've looked at a lot of cases all over the country and it's quite common for either the defendants to be gay or the defendants to be suspected to be gay. The first daycare conviction in 1985 was of a young man in Massachusetts. He was working in a daycare center and when he was 18 years old he came out. There were parents of children at the daycare center who were very anxious and disturbed by the fact that he was gay. - Did Fran touch Christie anywhere else? Where, show me, point to it on your dolly for me. Right here, all over here? What was she doing? - [Reporter] Biased interviewers, the suggestibility of children, and pressure from police and parents led to problems with the children's testimony. The modern version of the witchcraft trials. - Fake stories, folk tales, will look the same over time. It'll be like a certain motif, a pattern. And I really sense that with Vanessa's account. It has certain aspects that certainly sound like a story. You know Hansel and Gretel or Sleeping Beauty. Vanessa's outside playing with her sister. The door opens, it's her aunt Liz, come in, come into my cottage little girl. And then she starts yelling and screaming at her. So she becomes this ogre. On the floor are three nude women. They got on the bed and they started touching me. What did they say? They were silent. So it's imagery. It's too bizarre, it's almost dream like. - Liz called us into the apartment and I looked and I saw Anna and this other girl, they didn't have any tops on. They take each others hands and they go into this bedroom and suddenly they're making out and they're caressing each other. If you take the little girls out and you replace the little girls with a man, the whole scenario sounds like a porn movie and it sounds like a man's version of what women do in their spare time. - The case, it went off track in about every way you could. Credulous people believing this. Little tinged with a little satanic abuse. - By 1994 when the San Antonio case broke, most of the satanic ritual abuse panic was over. But the pediatrician who examined these little girls, because the alleged perpetrators were four women, that kind of fit the satanic thing. And she wrote in her record, possible satanic abuse. And that got the police even more excited. So I can say that this case is probably the last gasp of the satanic ritual abuse panic. (somber music) - [Anna] When I walked into prison dormitories for the first time, of course I was scared. I had to put on this mask of no nonsense, fearless, and hold my head up and just walk like I knew what I was doing. - I was angry at God. I felt like, how could this happen, you know. Always, I feel like the truth, you know, will set you free. You tell the truth, you'd be alright. - [Cassie] My first years of incarceration, I acted out, I was hurt. I lost my kids, my father had just passed away, I left my mom raising my kids by herself. It was really, really hard. The way we have to get up, and the way we have to go to work, and the way we have to strip, and I mean, you know, just it's all degrading. - And here we are. (somber music) - Me not having contact with them and things, I didn't know how they felt about everything. But I knew for myself that their whole life had been taken away because of me. And that bothered me so much. - I've been coming here for six years. I come every year and visit the four women. Some are here in Gatesville and some are about 60 kilometers away in a place called Marlin. Seven years ago this month I came across the story about four women who'd been accused of this bizarre sexual assault on two little girls in Texas. And I'd been doing some research on that type of crime and this one just didn't make sense. And so I started doing research. And I came across a video in the library in the college where I teach about female sex offenders. More specifically women who offend against children. - [Woman] That only five percent of all sex offenders are women. - The majority fall into what are called teacher lovers. What you have is an adult female with an adolescent male. When you have a single woman assaulting a small child the majority of the time she has major mental illness. This case you've got four women offending against two children, it just didn't make sense. It just didn't fit the pattern at all. This is the first time I'd actually worked up the nerve to contact somebody. I wrote this letter and then three weeks later I got this response, this fairly thick letter back in the mail and it was from this woman Elizabeth Ramirez and what I got kinda shocked me. It was very upbeat, very friendly. I wrote back and I said, I'd like to hear your side of the story. Would you be willing to talk to me about your crime? The next letter said, well there isn't much to tell because the allegations against me are false, they never happened. Outside of her family, I was the first contact out of prison she'd had in nine years. Took me a long time to understand everything. How did this get past the media? I mean how did this get past the jury? How did this get past the appeals process? How did this get past their defense lawyers? - Darrell Otto is a man that truly believes in our innocence. Has actually stuck by us and helped us and pushed for us. - It took this guy in Canada to figure out what was wrong with a case in Texas. He tells us that he's living in the Yukon territory with a bunch of mush dogs. We get countless emails and letters from people saying, my son is innocent, my husband's innocent, I'm innocent, please take my case. And Darrell's was one of those emails. - Just to believe. Just to finally believe that we're actually innocent. - So we're in the back of our main office here in Lubbock. This is our big storage room. Files starting here, they wrap all the way around, thousands of more files back here that are closed. Pre-questionnaire files back there. We've been in existence since early 2007. Since then we've received over 10,000 unique requests for assistance. These are peoples lives you know? These are peoples cases. This is what has them in prison right now and ostensibly for something they didn't commit. You know, we don't know whether or not every one of these people are innocent. - If this was an easy case, someone would have snapped it up a long time ago probably. If this was a case that involved DNA and just a DNA test. But it's a very difficult case without a magic bullet such as DNA. This is a case in which no crime at all occurred. - I look at these cases as a great chance to show a deeper more persistent bias in the criminal justice system, a bias against gay people, that I think we refuse to admit. You know we like to pretend that there's no racism in the criminal justice system. - [Reporter] 46 people were arrested, all but five of them black, indicted for selling drugs, but no drugs were found in any of the houses. - The Tulia case involved a racist cop that framed pretty much the entire African American population of a little town in Texas. We got 38 pardons, the largest mass pardon in US history. I saw how much of a difference once case could make if you approached it politically. We've gotten a lot of cases done and we've changed a lot. A lot of lawyers jump into these cases and they think that just 'cause their client's innocent, their cause is just, they're gonna win. The truth, that is so far from the truth. If people only knew how little truth and justice had to do with the way the legal system works. They'd probably would mass at court houses with lighted torches. - Since May 17th, I arrived at the Hilltop unit. I knew that with my charge eventually this sex offender program would come up. I refused to do it. I have refused two classes. I'll be in a different custody level because of it. You know and I've fought so many years to be able to have privileges, you know. And now I'm going to have to give all that up. But I'm okay with it. I'll lose this battle, but not the war. - It's a cross, it's a rosary. And it's like withered, it's been beaten and it looks like it's damaged and that's why I chose it because, you know, we've been through so much. And I saw it and I was like, that's pretty I want that. - No. - No we got separated. It wasn't, we haven't had closure, I'll say that. We haven't had closure. Are we together now? No we're not. It wasn't, you know, a bad breakup and it's very unfortunate but that's what life dealt to us. - If we were still out there, I believe that we would still be together because we were already together for seven years and then all this happened. We didn't separate by choice, the system tore us apart. - Do I love her? I'm always gonna love her. You know me and her have had a past. We raised two kids together, you know. Will we ever be back together? I can't tell you that. - Hey Deb it's Mike Ware. It's Saturday morning about 9:45. I just got off the phone from Stephanie. Jeff and I are talking about driving out to Houston tomorrow to talk to her. She's ready to make this right, get her aunt out of prison. So I'm pretty excited. Give me a call. - That's my cell, okay? And email and all that stuff's on there. A couple of preliminary's like, we're not paying you money. - [Stephanie] No. - Or threatening you or anything like that? - No, as a matter of fact my Dad's the one that's threatening me that he will get my children taken away if I open my mouth. - [Mike] Why don't you start at the beginning. - Um. - Or wherever you think is a reasonable place to start. - Okay so my sister had dolls, you know, Barbie dolls. We're young, we're stupid, we're gonna experiment. We're gonna see what you show us, you know. And my grandma caught us. And they locked us in a room, they sat there for, I dunno, what seemed like forever, like, what happened there, what happened there, you know something happened there, yes you know something happened there. Which, nothing happened, and we told them nothing happened, nothing happened, nothing happened. They didn't buy it. And she goes, you know, who touched you there? Who taught? And my grandma was putting stuff, my grandma Fina was putting stuff in our head, you know. Somebody touched you down there. - [Jeff] You think this all started because the Barbie doll thing? - I think, yes honestly, I think it all started because the Barbie doll thing. - Okay. - And um, we were, we got threatened. You're gonna get taken away, you're gonna end up on the street, no one's gonna want you. You like or you're gonna go to prison. And I swear to god I'll beat you if you don't listen and you don't do exactly what I tell you. - [Mike] Now who's telling you this? - My dad and my grandma. And I realize now as an adult, my dad would do inappropriate stuff in front of us with women. I've come to him in the past and I've told him that I don't remember anything happening to me. And he says it did, you're stupid, you don't know, you don't know anything. And I said, I do remember. I asked him, how is it I remember all the good things she's put me through, but never the bad things. And he says that I'm crazy. He says that I don't know what I'm talking about, that I'm just crazy. I mean. It's just wrong. It's wrong to have let my dad scare me, and finally it just. I'm scared of him still, don't get me wrong, and I will always be scared of my dad. - What's it gonna take to at least maybe get some kind of objective conversation with your sister about all this? I mean will she talk to us? - She won't talk. Is this the same one? (background chatter) She is my aunt and I wanted her to know that you know what, I am there for here and I'm sorry that it took so many years. She never told us no. Her fixing my hair in the mornings when we went to work with her. And me telling her I didn't want her to touch my hair and she's like, no, you need to look nice and I wasn't used to that. And her singing me to sleep when we'd go to bed. She'd be in there and she'd sing us to sleep and then she'd walk our the room and close the door. Making me eggs with cheese. Man I've never had that before, but I love that to this day. I have so many good memories of her and nothing bad. - [Reporter] One of the victims has actually recanted. The cameras were rolling as one of the victims with lawyers in the room says that she made it all up and was afraid to tell the truth for all those years. - [Newscaster] One of the victims has recanted her testimony. And the discovery of flawed scientific. (dramatic music) - Last night I got the official notice that I made parole. How can it be? I had my mind set on doing two more years and now it's two months. I have a lot of questions about this. Why did I make parole? My heart hurts when I think of Cass, Liz, and Kris. I don't want to leave them behind. It doesn't feel right. Why should I be the one to leave. Cass and Liz have children. Haven't they suffered enough? I think about what my plans will be when I get out of prison and I really don't have any clue. I don't know if I will be exonerated. I don't know if I'll have to register as a sex offender. So I try and take everything day by day. - I kinda froze it. Because the words were kind of melting off. And it says welcome home Anna. And I haven't seen her where I can be able to hug her because she's been behind the glass. So I'm gonna finally get to hug her and I'm like not gonna let her go. Okay you're taking the blankets for her? - [Maria] Yes. - [Rose] In case she gets cold? - [Maria] Yes. - So we're taking the blankets. I got everything in the car. - [Maria] Okay Bobby lock up. - Okay. - [Bobby] No Mom, I'm gonna throw a party. (laughing) - Just make sure not to go in Anna's room. Okay I can't believe it, we're like two minutes away from reception. (dramatic music) (police radio chatter) (crying) - [Rose] I love you. - [Anna] I love you too. - [Rose] We're not gonna let you go every again, okay? - How you feeling? - [Rose] Are you okay? (crying) - You have the windows open? No getting nauseous. - [Rose] Put the windows up Chris. - Are you glad to be out of there? - [Rose] I love you. - I love you too. - Oh baby. - [Rose] Here Juicy Fruit. - [Maria] They may want to take some pictures of us or something, I don't know. - Oh this is the bomb. I have not chewed gum in 12 years. I am out in the world. - [Chris] Well how does it feel? - Exhilarating. Wow. - [Rose] Okay welcome home babe. - Oh wow. Wow. Everything looks so small. That's the Anna wall. - [Rose] Yes the Anna wall. - That's the Anna wall. (moving music) - [Rose] Welcome home. - Wow. Oh wow. (women talking over each other) Oh this is nice girl. Uh what is that? - [Chris] It's a router. - Oh. - [Rose] Oh it's a router. Oh that goes, yeah we'll talk to you about that later. You can open your closet. - [Anna] Open my closet? Oh girl I got some clothes now. I got some color. - [Rose] Yes you do. - Nothing white. - Nothing white. (laughing) (dramatic music) - We have created a permanent class of false accusers. What we have got here, and not just here, but in a lot of cases, is a government agency that deliberately attracts bad people to it who have their own petty personal agendas and find that through using agencies they get to advance those agendas. - [Woman] Do you feel like you have something to hide? - No, nothing at all. - [Woman] Do you have something to fear? - No, no, no. And this is what I tell Stephanie. Stephanie, whatever it is you're gonna do, do it more quickly. That's what I say to Stephanie. And, but understand Stephanie that when you do this, you gotta remember what you're gonna do and what's gonna come to be. You're gonna have to deal with it, you're gonna have to live with it. And I'm not saying that in any form or fashion that it's a threat, it's the fact that Stephanie does these things out of anger and doesn't know what is gonna come to be. And when it comes to be, usually, it winds up hurting her and her kids. - When I met with Javier a couple of weeks ago I was in Houston. Just about everybody he's been involved with, he's somehow or another manipulated it and made the mothers look really bad so that he could have custody of the children. We're on our way to go meet Serafina Limon who is the grandmother of the two girls. The first adult that supposedly was told about this. - I never questioned my daughters at all, I didn't. Because of the fact that, I was not, I wanted to remain fair and impartial to everything. I didn't want people to say, well this is what you said to them. I did nothing other than take them to where I was instructed. They did the interviewing, they did the questioning. All I did, and they did the examinations. All I did was take them and support my daughters and was there for my daughters. Did nothing else other than doing what a dad would do in this kind of situation, in any kind of situation. So that's what I did. My mother was the one who they questioned. (dramatic music) - This is. - That is right here? Yeah. - At Christmas. - She celebrated his first birthday with him. And after that, that's when she was incarcerated. He was just barely walking and crawling. The reason he accused them, I think, is the rejections. He doesn't like to be rejected. He sent her some love letters and then when I confronted him one day with the love letters, I had the original ones. I said, what's going on with this? He looked at me and like, how did you get 'em? Because Elizabeth had given them to me. - So he was angry. - Yeah, surprised. - Surprised. - That I had the letters. - I didn't write them, okay. Those letters turned up. Gloria had them in her hand. Okay Gloria had them in her hand. She spoke to me about and I said I didn't write anything, I didn't write anything. - A week out here in the world is like a year in prison. You know where in the world you're working, you have errands to run, you maybe are dating. But in prison it's like you're just stuck there. A lot of these prison shows I'm like constantly watching them. I mean like episode after episode in that. It's like I can relate. It's weird. The way she's making characters out of the eggs, that's so true. When you're locked up alone and there's nobody you can talk to, you long for that, you long for some kind of, I don't know almost like human contact and stuff like that. When I was in solitary, oh my god I was losing my mind. That was the hardest time I've ever done. In almost 13 years, that was the hardest time. - [Woman] Why were you in the SHU? - Because I had been kicked out of the sex offender program for refusing to participate. It's one of the rules required by parole, I have to register as a sex offender. I cannot have any friends that have a child that is 17 years or under. So what I'm doing right now is trying to find the travel route to go to the HEB on 24th and Calabera Road. I have to follow this as it is written. Obviously when you go to HEB there's gonna be children and I think I fear the parents of the children. When I walk down an aisle wherever I may be, I'll pick an empty aisle just to avoid anything, any kind of confrontation. - I hurt for Anna 'cause I know that she struggles in the things that she has to do, it's not comfortable for her. I mean she's living life, she has her family, it's all great. But all the restrictions and people looking at you and wondering, you know, I think as far as her going home, it makes me hope that, I know that she's our voice out there and she's doing so much and that means a lot to me. It means a lot to all of us. (dramatic music) - Inmates cannot write other inmates. So as a matter of fact I haven't heard from Kristie until I got out. We were always at different prisons. It makes me feel really good that they actually completely trust me and my judgement. They know that I'm gonna do everything that I possibly can for them. - [Jeff] People think that these cases are won or lost in court, they're not. They're won or lost in the public's mind. Without real support and mobilization of that support we will not win this thing. (dramatic music) - There are three other women behind bars, and I don't feel complete without them until they are home and we get exoneration of this. Being in the limelight if I have to. Whatever I have to do, I'm going to do that and they are my determination. Now I am the voice for the San Antonio Four and I will continue to fight for our innocence. - [Reporter] Anna Vasquez who are you? - I am an innocent woman fighting for her innocence to be proven, you know. To finally show the truth. - In 2009 you had the National Academy of Sciences issue a wide scale report where they basically looked at almost every forensic science discipline across the board. And almost every one of these disciplines lacks the underlying scientific foundation that it needs to be a valid forensic science. That goes for arson, shaken baby, toolmark analysis, hair and fiber, finger prints. They said lots of testing needs to be done. So much of it is left up to a certain level of subjectivity to the analyst who's looking at it. - It's the misuse of science. People call that junk science. We know now that the use of phony pediatric testimony, the finding of signs of sexual abuse when there aren't any is a persistent practice and when I see that in one of these cases, I think okay another red flag. - We're in the middle of history right now. We're the first state allowing people to challenge their cases based on forensic science alone. That's ground breaking, it's the first of its kind in the country. - Now that doctors have looked at the genitals of normal children for whom there's no suspicion whatsoever that they've been hurt, it turns out that the same features that were on these little girls are often seen on normal non-abused children. - We decided to have Dr. Kellogg draft an affidavit about the changed science. About how her testimony back in the 97, 98 trials were actually in error. It's a biological fact that hymens do not heal like scars on a hand, like what Kellogg testified to. We're 180 degrees wrong about the prosecutor and I think things are gonna move pretty rapidly. - Well, we'll see. - The women known as the San Antonio Four may be freed from prison to await possibly new trials. - [Reporter] Now that new court documents have been filed asking they be freed or retried. - [Newscaster] Clear and convincing new evidence, inaccurate expert testimony. - [Reporter] Documents point to changes in science since then disproving crucial medical testimony. - [Newscaster] Doctor who examined the girls back in 94 says testimony about a scar on the victims privates was materially inaccurate. That had she known then what she knows now, thanks to advances in science, she never would have testified the girls showed any sign of trauma. - It's awesome I mean, just like we've always said, it never happened. And we always go back to that one statement. And finally it's coming out. Okay, alright, bye. She's really excited. - [Denise] Is she? - Yeah. - [Woman] What'd she say? - She's at work, can't say much at work. - Can't say too much, but she's really excited. And she was saying our prayers have been answered and what not, so. It's been a long time, it's been a long time. For everybody, you know? Almost 20 years.

(people chattering) - They're getting ready to come out. - [Woman] Here they come mama. Grandma's coming. (cheering and applauding) (crying) - Oh my god, hi, I'm your grandma baby. I'm your grandma. You're so beautiful. I love you. Come here babies. - [Reporter] What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get home? - Spend time with my family. - [Woman] We love you Cassie. - [Girl] It's over, thank god. - [Cassie] Yeah. - [Reporter] The women met with reporters today for the first time since their release. They discussed their time in prison and their new found freedom. But their main concern is having their case exonerated. - The exoneration is important to us because that will say that nothing ever had happened. To be totally exonerated and not have anything on us. - [Reporter] The next step is to appeal the women's case to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals which could lead to exoneration. - I've been locked up 16 years. But if I have to wait my whole life for it, I will. - [Kristie] Yeah definitely. - One thing we've learned is you never stop fighting for what you believe in and we're not gonna give up now. - We're not. - We've come to far. - We'll never give up. - [Elizabeth] We all come as one package from the beginning and we're gonna stay that way. - Yes we are very close, we check on each other every day. Elizabeth is, she was my best friend before this and she's my best friend now. (upbeat music) - [Woman] How was that? - Well it was kinda weird at first right? Actually we fought it right? A little bit. I don't know Kristie, you answer that one. - Why does it all gotta be on me. - Because I've been talking about it all. I mean your view has to be seen too. - No I don't think it was weird. - But we weren't supposed to be doing it. (laughing) - I think it caught us both by surprise. - Okay yeah, okay well it could be too much. Okay, that's a good answer. - But I don't say like weird or anything like that 'cause I think we, we feel comfortable with each other, you know what I'm saying, so I don't think it was weird in that aspect or anything. It was like, caught us by surprise I guess. - I wanna say our first time that we were together was pretty intimate though. - [Man] Was it good? - Yeah. Well for me it was. For you? - Of course. - So, um, and that kinda was what opened the door. This will be our first time coming to mass since we've been out. I'm excited about it that I can go to church, 'cause we did ours in a classroom. - [Man] Y'all coming back? - Yeah. - [Kristie] Yeah. - [Elizabeth] Those are nice pants. You look good. - And then this was like the morning that I came home. The first morning home. I went downstairs and drank a cup of coffee, real coffee. There's Mikey when he was a chicken when he was little. That's him on one of his birthdays. I was still incarcerated. I'm still mad because of all the time that I lost. But all I know is that we're gonna make up for it. And I know that, I'm probably a pain because I'm following them around the house, you know. I'll be like. Yeah. I'll be like Mijo, and I'll just walk in his room. If he locks his door I'm like, don't lock the door. But um, I dunno, i just, they'll be doing things and they don't even know but I'll just be staring at 'em you know. If he leaves for five minutes I'm like, where are you. You know I get on my phone. I learned how to text okay, and you better answer me. - The night that we got released, that was the first time I held him since he was four years old. That's the picture. After I had him, I had to sacrifice, you sacrifice for your children, you know. And with my son, that's what I did. I stopped dating women because of that. Because I wanted him to be raised, you know, proper. At that time in the 90's, mom and dad. Hector. - [Hector] Yes? - We actually had a heart to heart talk about my lifestyle. It's like he said, Mom I'm not dumb, I know. It was very healing for both of us. I can't remember what I told you. - You did. - [Woman] You haven't seen her in maybe almost 18? - Well since 1994 when the accusations happened. - Well actually since we left the apartment that night and we dropped her off on that Sunday is the last time that I ever seen her. And then the day that we went to court and she waved at us and that was it. - She is very brave. It takes a lot of courage to go against your family. I couldn't even imagine going through a situation like that. You know, to where you have to be afraid of your family and what they might do to you for speaking the truth. But I know that I would thank her for giving me my life back, you know. (door bell ringing) - [Elizabeth] Hi Mija. - Hey. Hi Grandma. - [Gloria] Hi how are you? - [Stephanie] Good. - [Gloria] You cold? - [Elizabeth] Do you know Mike, Mija? - Yeah. I've been talking to Mike for awhile. - How are you doing? It's cold right? - Yeah I had to get my daughter. She bit, so they told me to pick her up. - Oh. - So. - I just want you to know Mija I'm not mad or anything like that. Okay? And I do love you. And I'm just, I'm glad that you did come forward with everything, 'cause it'd been a long time. And I just wanted to tell you thank you for that. Okay? And I just want you to be at peace with that. Here, come here. It's okay. - [Stephanie] No it's not. I'm so sorry. - I could never be mad at you Mija 'cause you were little and you don't know better anyway. I know. It's okay. I'm sorry that you had to go through all that though. You know? But now we just have to put it behind us and make the best of everything. And hopefully everything will be good and it will come out okay with everything. You know? - [Woman] All rise. - [Mike] We've alleged several grounds for relief, one of which is actual innocence. And the judge will just make a recommendation that will ultimately be ruled on by nine judges at the Court of Criminal Appeals. - The three other women were tried together by me, I say by me, before me by a jury of their peers in 1998. All defendants were convicted on all counts. - One of three things can happen. They can be found actually innocent, which is exoneration, a judicial finding of actual innocence. The court can find that there, for whatever reason, is not enough evidence of actual innocence. But they could find that they are still entitled to a new trial because they had an unfair trial. And of course the third possibility in the universe of possibilities is they could be denied all relief and have to return to prison to finish out their sentences. And the evidence can show the new evidence that any rational juror would have a reasonable doubt at the very least. The fantastical story told by two little girls. No more true than any of Brothers Grimm's fairy tales. - [Judge] This cause will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. - [Women] Yes sir. - [Judge] Alright thank you. You may be seated. - We have normal play being pathologized and now we're gonna come back and blame the lesbians because oh my gosh, this is back in the day when people thought homosexuals abused kids. The proportion of homosexuals abusing kids is no different than heterosexuals abusing kids. So there's no reason to conclude because they're gay they would've abused the children unless you're kind of naive. And maybe you have a vendetta. Liz has rejected him and the revenge motive takes place throughout the history of this case with Stephanie, even to the point where she's recanting. So you have this amalgam of history coming together in an allegation that is not integrated and it doesn't make sense. I've interviewed hundreds of people who have been sexually abused, I have never heard anything that even came close to this. - It's my professional opinion that she does not classify as a sex offender due to the polygraphs she did not commit the offense. And the sex history polygraph proves that she never engaged in any devious sexual behavior in her life. - No sir, it can be anything that would be illegal. - Like voyeurism, exhibitionism, rape of an adult. - [Mike] Do you see anything at all in this report that would give you cause for concern that Anna either committed the offense she was convicted of. - [Maria] They all scored minimum, they would not be a risk. - But I really resent anybody referring to the testimony she offered in the 1997 and 1998 trials as being junk science. She is not a junk scientist, the science was not junk, the science has developed further, and she was honest enough to impeach herself and her own testimony by acknowledging that fact. I will then make my findings and notify everyone what they are.
