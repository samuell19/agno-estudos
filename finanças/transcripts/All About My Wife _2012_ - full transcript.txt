NEW UNITED PICTURES, SOVIK VENTURE CAPITAL AND NEXT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD PRESENT A SOO FILM AND ZIP CINEMA PRODUCTION NAGOYA, JAPAN This looks great. - Let's talk later, Mom. - Hey... And try not to call me. - I'm not speaking Korean while I'm here. - Wait, honey... I wonder why my friends don't call. - International calls don't cost much. - Listen to me. They only text me sometimes. - Let me say... - "Have a wonderful day." What is that? Then I start wondering if I should reply. - Let's just hang up. - I shouldn't talk a lot, so don't call. Bye. Mommy! Oh my god! Mom! This is so scary! Stay calm. Mommy! Are you Korean? - Yes. - It'll stop soon. Don't worry. Thank you. Pull yourself together. Look into my eyes. My eyes. Over here. It's hard not to worry when the ground is shaking, right? I know the safest place in Japan. Will you go with me? I promise you'll feel safe there. I'm back. Welcome back. Uenogiri. A Japanese seismic design architect I admire. He built this house for his wife, so this is the safest place on earth. You don't have to worry now. I'm serious. I study this field, so I know. An international student? You don't speak Korean well? Are you Japanese-Korean? I promised myself to only speak Japanese while I'm here. You're keeping that promise even in an earthquake. That's amazing. Please speak more slowly. I don't speak Japanese very well. Are you a student? I came to learn how to cook. I was bored. Then you must be a great cook. Have some tea. Nothing is happening. There's really nothing happening. Oh. It's your cell phone vibrating, not an earthquake. Hey. Let me buy you lunch. It's really an honor to meet such a beautiful woman. Do you like gyudon? - HONEY? SWEETIE! - BABY? BOO! - WHY STOP?:-( - JUST KISS HER! TOKYO CITY 100 DAYS - IT'S BEEN 100 DAYS - LET'S CELEBRA TE BY... NAGOYA - AM I PRETTY? - MAKEUP WOULDN'T HURT SUNSHINE SAKAE - I WANT YOU - THEN YOU HAVE ME! 200 DAYS PACHINKO - I'M GOOD! - I'M GOOD A T OTHER THINGS... 300 DAYS SEOUL - DOING IT ON CARS IS HARD:-( - MY BACK! - SO INCONSIDERATE! - GET A ROOM! - LET'S GO SOMEWHERE QUIET - YOU READ MY MIND - I LOVE YOU - I LOVE YOU MORE - WHAT DO YOU WANNA EAT? - YOU! IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE - I WANNA WAKE UP WITH YOU! - MAKE ME YOURS! - YOU'RE MINE FOREVER! - LET'S HAVE THREE KIDS! SEVEN YEARS LATER NO NEWSPAPERS PLEASE! Excuse me, sir! The sign says "no newspapers". - I didn't see it. - It's been up for a week. - Give me a better excuse. - But your subscription is... I was trying to be as polite as possible, so I even wrote "please". I didn't write anything mean because I thought you'd understand. - That gift comes with a subscription... - This thing? The brakes broke after two rides. What if I were going downhill? I could've gotten hit by a car and died thinking, I shouldn't have taken that newspaper. - Lady, it could've been your fault... - Excuse me? Lady? Don't you dare call me "lady" just because I won't subscribe! - Watch how scary a "lady" can be! - What's wrong with you? You're up? - They keep giving us newspapers... - Just come inside. - I'm in the middle of a conversation. - Jung-in! What? Let's go in. You're causing a scene. Come on. Stop giving us newspapers. How can you cut me off like that? What would he think of me? I don't need any juice. You don't need it or you don't want it? Close the door. I'm taking a dump. Drink up. I'm taking a dump right now. There's nothing wrong with drinking at the same time. It's not as hypocritical as reading poetry on the john. Fine. It's bitter. What? You're adorable. Hey! - Pick up your socks. - Pass me those shorts. - What for? - I'm wearing them again! And stop cutting me off in front of other people. They'll think I embarrass you. I didn't say anything wrong. Why is it so hard for you to complain? It's not healthy. You can't be nice all the time. Let's break up. - Huh? - What? I was just kidding. You think that's funny? Huh? - How could you say that? - It was just a joke. - And while I was naked! - I wasn't thinking straight. - Just eat and go to work. - Honey, this dish is amazing! - Don't put cigarettes in the fridge. - Stop nagging! - It's sitting next to all the food. - I like keeping it cool! - It's still morning. Go outside. - It's morning, so what? None of these lighters work. There's one right there. Stop complaining so much. Why can't you just let me eat? Why are you doing this to me? I feel like some dirty old rag doll. Like you don't want me, but you can't throw me out. - What are you saying? - Don't joke like that again. I won't. I'm sorry. I can't help thinking about it. - I was naked. - I'm really sorry. - My head hurts. - Why? Why do you think? I only used an ashtray this morning, and it's unfair that I have to wash all these dishes. I'm sorry. - Come home early. We should talk. - Okay. - I'm gonna hang up first. - Okay. I'll count to three, and you can hang up first. One... GRUMPY - What is it, honey? - The TV remote is broken. - Maybe it's out of batteries. - The channel won't change. - I'm driving right now... - So I should hang up? - Fine! - No, I didn't mean... I need to get divorced. Please just let me get a divorce! What kind of driving is that? Six new stadiums are being built. With the earthquake issue in Japan, we need our seismic design team to supervise the construction. So if you join our team at Pyeongchang, you'll be stuck in Kangwon Province... For at least a year... - Me! I'll go, sir. - I'll take that position, Director NA. I will take it. I don't know why you're both so eager to go, - but the company wants Mr. LEE. - Thank you. I'll do you proud. - Thank you, sir. - I got divorced, sir. I have nothing left in life. - I need some time away. - You have a girlfriend. - You had an affair? - She caught me. You idiot. The alimony payment left me broke. I'm living in a... A tiny studio for rent! - That's pretty unfortunate... - You're crying now? - Thank you, sir. - Good night. You're late and you didn't text me back. Kwang-shik got divorced, so I bought him a drink. - No surprise there. - He's not a bad guy. - I had to meet my cousin today. - I was talking. She met some guy through a dating service. How can it be fate when she picked his credentials? She kept saying they had the same horoscope. She talked about love and fate for two hours, and she's even two months pregnant. - That's great. - I congratulated her too. Then she got on my case about when we're having kids. She lectured me and told me I should try harder! - Before I get too old! - Forget about it. Who cares about what other people think? - You're just letting her get to you. - Get me cigarettes. - I'll quit when I want to! - I didn't say anything! - You gave me a dirty look! - What? What did I do, huh? I did nothing! Hey! You think you have nothing, but you're wrong! Because you have freedom. The world is yours! But I'm stuck in this prison every day! - Your wife is pretty high-maintenance. - I can handle that part. She's embarrassing. She never stops talking. - Then get a divorce! - I want to! But I don't know how! She'll ask a million questions if I ever bring it up. You wanna die? Can you pay the alimony? - I'm worth a lot, you know! - If I can even answer her questions... Then she'll start nag me about my answers! I can't take it anymore! Sheesh. Hey. What about this? Make her want to divorce you first. How? - Do everything that she hates. - For example? - Change your routine. - I need details. - What do you do when you get home? - Get changed. Don't. - Wash up. - Don't wash! And sit down for dinner. Don't change or wash up, and don't eat! How was your day? Onions are so expensive now. Change and get ready for dinner. - I'm not changing. - What? Are you deaf? I'm not gonna change. What's with you? Are you all right? - Are you sick? - No. Then go and wash up. - No! I'm not hungry! - I made spaghetti! Jung-in, we need to... It's your favorite! Does it taste bad? No, it's great! Director NA... Kwang-shik! - At least she's a great cook. - That's even scarier! I have to eat in my sleep, sir. Even on the toilet. - And even while we're doing it. - Oh my. - Have you ever tried it? - We had yogurt once. Why don't you let us go together? - Where? Out of this world? - Please, sir! Just figure it out yourselves. - Director NA! - Come on, Kwang-shik! Please. I can't help it. They need me so badly. - But I could visit once a week. - No, no... Maybe once a month? But what's the point in working so hard, when you have to sacrifice your happiness for it? I'm putting in everything I have for our happiness, honey. Jung-in. I'm the breadwinner here. The man of the house. There's a weight on my shoulders that only I can feel. - I'm sorry for complaining. - No, I understand. Drink up. Oh my god! A fire! Move back or you'll get hurt! Hold on... Thank you... Then when would we talk? When? Let's get out of here first. - The bed is so far away, honey. - Huh? Come on. What are you doing? - Don't play dumb. - What? - Think of me as dessert. - I don't really like dessert. - The main course, then. - I'm pretty full. - Should I move with you? - Huh? I might get lonely. - Honey! - Huh? I'll pay a month's worth of dues tonight. - A month? - Wait, no! All my dues for my entire life. Where do you want it? The hips? - Damn it! - What's wrong? Sleeping with me is like paying dues for you? Forget it. Jung-in! But it's been ages... I couldn't care less! Just don't go! We'll just grow further apart! Honey. I love you. Really? How much? - I love doing it on the table! - Stop! Yes! I'm free! 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS! The elementary school is hiring new English teachers. Keep that in mind. This is Midday Gangneung. Our last song for today. A studio favorite. "Let's Stop Here and Now". How can you yawn every time we're on the air? It's not easy making up audience comments every day. - No one wrote to us today? - Just four ads about acai berries. All written by one person. Everything looks so fresh! You get to eat this every day? Why are you so excited to be stuck here? I love the countryside. - I'm taking in all this nature. - And you're so talkative now. That's my wife's fault. You sound like a bitter old man. Badmouthing your wife to others is mean. Aren't you ever getting married? I don't know... This is great, anyway. I was bored having no one around. Having no one around is great and being bored is better! It is? I'm not even buying any furniture. I'm going to keep myself free of everything. Just me and the quiet house. Come out and talk to me. Let me see you one last time. Open the door, baby! It's over! You're home! Huh? Did I surprise you? You didn't eat yet, right? - Go wash up. - Yeah... One for you and one for me. Why aren't you eating? How did you get here? So you're... - You're staying, right? - Of course! What? Country life seemed too much for me, but we've been struggling. It'll be nice to start fresh here. Like a honeymoon. I made all the arrangements so I could surprise you. - I'm thrilled... - Isn't it great? But that house needs constant care and attention. You know how hard I worked on that house. Doo-hyun. It's not about the house, but the family. You're right. A house filled with people, music, good food, and happiness. But you only think of the house and there's nothing inside it. Come on! You'll never fix that habit! Damn it. I told you we can't wash the table with detergent. All we can do is wipe it off, but you spit food on it! It's so unsanitary! Gosh. - What's wrong? - Huh? My stomach hurts. I'm going to the bathroom. What are you doing? I'll keep you company. No! Don't follow me! Just go back to Seoul! Go back! Just fucking go! Get over here. Here! You try it! Here! You like that? Why are you staring at me? Oh, nothing. Where's the bathroom? Professional baby pictures are so harsh! Forcing them to smile and pose... Just look at the babies' faces! It's just cruel punishment, for adult entertainment. Don't you think it's cruel? Well, isn't this nice? There's no welcome party, but we're having a couples garden party this weekend. If you don't have a partner, find someone to fake it for you. - All right? - Yes, sir! Director NA. My wife came down with a fever. - She's here with you? - Yes... - Then you should bring her! - But she has a bad cold. It's not like she has a cast. - I should've brought Kwang-shik. - Sir! - Give me her number. - No, I'll make sure to bring her. - She'll be all better for the party. - That's better. That bastard... What are you looking at, asshole? I wish I could just kill him. Sung-ki! Sung-ki! I came halfway across the globe for your birthday! You hit me? You hit me first, so I hit you back. You lied to me! You ruined my life! I didn't ruin it. You gave up on it yourself. I told you from the start, I'm just a Casanova! I thought it was love! The last love of my life! I told you before. I don't know what love is. - Go away. - I left my family for you. He's mine! - Who the hell are you? - Get away from my man! I brought your favorite fruit! Don't do this to me, baby! I divorced my husband for you! I left him and my kids! Why are you so cruel? I don't have money to go back to China! I told him you were sick. - But he was about to call you. - I don't want to go. I hate those company parties. All those wives treating me like some kind of servant. So you can't go, right? But I should go to support you. Huh? What happened? You broke a plate? - Just a small side plate. - Which one? - Just a side plate. - We don't have side plates! Honey! - She really wanted to come. - That's all right. She had to get a cast on her leg. Oh my. Honey! Wow! Is your leg all right? - What a charming wife! - Nice to meet you. I'm Director NA. - But you can just call me Noah. - Sure. - I'm feeling extra friendly today. - You're always friendly, sir. I'll be inside, honey. Nice meeting you. You should go home if you don't feel well. Hello. You're older than Doo-hyun? It must be nice living with a young husband. I'm three years younger than him. Are you serious? I was thrown off by your heavy makeup. It's heavy for a housewife, isn't it? - How many kids do you have? - We don't. Still? So you're a working woman? It must be quite an important job. - I'm a housewife. - Then you should have kids! We like it this way, just the two of us. You're too young to know. Look at me. My child changed my life. And my second is on the way. Such a darling baby! She's already talking and she just poops so well! Nothing is better than a child who poops well! It may as well be peanut butter in my eyes! I'm not like those other bosses' wives. Some women make the wives help out with parties, but employees aren't slaves. How could I boss around their families? You'll find that I'm almost too polite. - You have nothing to worry about. - I don't worry about such things. The wives go golfing together every week. - You should come and... - I don't like sports. - You must like something! - I don't, actually. I don't like anything. Do I have to have something that I like? - Well, I never! - Me neither. Hey! Who says you can yell? Where's your mother? - Say "I'm sorry"! - I'm sorry! - "I'm sorry!" - Honey! - Your wife is a bit forward. - Pardon? I don't see why I shouldn't be. As long as I'm polite, why should I keep quiet? People who can't speak up make it unbearable for all. Making someone feel awkward, that's being impolite. She's an only child, so she's rather outspoken. - So what if I'm an only child? - Honey. Don't judge people on their family environment. I'm not the only one here. Any only children here? Would you raise your hand? Let's go. - What are you doing? - Jung-in. This is an important issue. That kind of judgment will just seclude only children in society. Please raise your hands! My goodness! Honey! I smiled politely. They're the ones who kept trying to pick a fight with me. - Come on. - They're a bunch of savages! - Change... - I'll apologize to you, but why should I apologize to those wives? Since when did our society become so hierarchical? It's absurd! Here's your change. Sir. You didn't stop the meter after we stopped. What are you talking about? - You think I'd cheat for change? - Mister. You think your life is hard and you want me to overlook this? How do you know if my life isn't worse? You don't want me to pity you, do you? I don't want to pity you either, so give me the exact change! Are you trying to kill yourself? What do you want? - What are you doing? - Just get down from there. - You won't kill yourself with me here. - Excuse me... - Hello? I need to report something. - Excuse me! Attempted murder. Excuse me, Mr. JANG Sung-ki? I have nothing to say. - I'd like to go. - Go and kill yourself? Suicide is murder too. You should arrest him. It's the only freedom that a man can truly have. So a killer's freedom is murder, theft is for thieves, and suicide is your freedom? - I'd like to go home, Officer. - Huh? Oh my! You need a guardian here for us to let you go. I have no one to guard me at my age. Only my soul can guard me. So your soul is trying to kill you? You're an assassin? Why are you trying to make me for a criminal? - You violated the law! - What happened? If you had jumped off, that'd be littering! There would be witnesses! Corrupting public morality! You'd ruin your family's reputation! That's slander! You shouldn't fight in here. Has your cell phone contract expired yet? You should at least stay alive until it expires. - Their services aren't for free! - Why can't you offer consolation? - Try to calm down! - How can I console a stranger? You want cheap consolation? Is your life worth so little that my consolation could save it? Fine then! Your life is precious! - Come see the show. - What's going on? - She's fun to watch. - I can hear you! If that's not what you want, then have some manners! I'm not here for you to gawk at me. I thought I was pretty quiet. - Jung-in! - What? Don't take it out on me! Excuse me, sir. It'd be wise for you to move or keep an eye on your wife. Excuse me? Dozens of women chase him every single day. This is top secret, but there was even a celebrity. - Chasing after him? - He's a real Casanova. Lucky bastard. I can't understand it either. Married women drag him to court. He's never been arrested, but he has one hell of a record. He got tired of it all and supposedly came here to retire. - Anyway, there's something about him. - What? How would I know? There's just something about him. Women just can't help throwing themselves at him. So keep an eye on your wife. Honey! The taxi is here! - I'm coming. - I warned you! PLEASE SAVE ME! I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL Are you the Casanova? What business do you have? Are you really that skilled? You don't look like it. I don't look like it? I don't know what you heard, but I did nothing to your precious wife. Please seduce my wife. Please seduce her and make her leave me! Do I look like a chump to you? What are you trying to pull? I'm serious. I want to get a divorce, but it's just so hard! I can't take it anymore! You saw for yourself! She's no average woman! She's going to suck me dry! There's nothing left for me in life. I can't do what you're asking. Please go away. If you won't help me, then I'll kill myself now. Go away! Save me! Come back! - Are you okay? - Please save me. Water is scary. I never learned to swim. You threatened me with your life! I hate that! Countless women have done that. But none of them died! That's how desperate I am! She was quiet at first. Shy at times. Such a sweet smile. But that's because she was learning Japanese at the time! I never saw it coming. I'm a victim! - Do you like the ocean? - What? I don't like the ocean. - That's where I lost my Poppy. - Poppy? I'm incapable of love. I'll break your wife's heart. Is that what you want? She'll get over it. She's a strong woman. Get her out of the house first. - Get her a job. - A job? She doesn't like that sort of thing. I need to see her out and about. Repetition of coincidence woos them every time. Coincidence? My wife doesn't believe in that sort of thing. There are only two types of women. A woman who believes in fate, and a woman who pretends not to. Then you'll take the job? What should I call you, sir? You've caught me off guard. My husband told me to say hello, but being a guest on the show? I'm not some celebrity. Why me? Well... Our guest for last season was just a local granny. - That's the charm of local radio. - Right. - We're like a small family. - A family! I'm not a local. So you'll give us a fresh perspective! I don't like the standard structure. - Reading letters and playing requests. - Right. I hate DJs that offer cheap advice that no one asked for. - What else? - Pardon? Anything else you don't like? - Tons of things, of course. - For example? There's so many... I hate people who worship things like fate or chance. - They force meaning into everything. - That's true. Men that sneer at TV dramas. Women that hate the news. I hate people who force you to become a morning person. The early bird catches the worm? The worm got up early too. Company field days at my husband's firm. A day of sports events won't unite your employees, and you have to let your boss win! - Have you ever tripped during a relay? - Oh my! They never let you live it down. Okay! - Let's do this. - Huh? Talk about what you hate, like you did just now. You know the pay is a thousand dollars. No, I don't know. - How did it go? - The pay... - She wants three times more. - What? She's a bit clueless, to say the least. - Be firm and tell her it's impossible. - She said she won't do it then. I'll pay for two thousand and you guys cover the rest. - You said she'd be a good guest. - Doo-hyun. Look for other options. I don't think we can do it. I spent a fortune buying PD CHOI drinks! Damn it. I spoke with upstairs and they're willing to double it. Wow! That's more than anyone has ever gotten before! - Maybe more with good ratings. - Then I won't do it. Fine. Three thousand it is. Since when did people love coffee so much? You have to study just to order anything. I'll have some strong drip coffee. What are you staring at? - Huh? - Someone you know? No, no. I'll go order. - What can I get you? - Huh? Two Americanos, please. What was I thinking? You're with them, right? Sir. Your receipt. - Where do I get the drinks? - Over there. This is Midday Gangneung. We have a new segment called "The Afternoon Crasher". Here's our guest, YEON Jung-in. - How are you, Jung-in? - Not good. Why? What's wrong? I recently realized that I hate optimists. How can anyone be optimistic all the time? That's just a downright lie. I met a friend a while back who was in a car accident. She was in a cast from her hips to her ankles. But she kept saying she was lucky. How in the world is that lucky? There's no such thing as a lucky car accident! - Jung-in... - The world isn't all great. Wouldn't this be the reasonable response? Damn it. What a shitty stroke of luck. I like people who complain all the time. It means they're honest. Why is she so hostile? - Hooray for grouches! - I pity her husband. - Hooray for Jung-in! - She'd suck the life out of any man. - Don't you think so? - Huh? Let's change the channel. We're lucky to have you on our show. But this is optimistic, isn't it? No. That's just the honest truth. - Thank you. - What in the world... We'll continue to the second half after a few songs. Are you going to start the plan now? Where the heck are you? - She's no ordinary woman. - I got her the job for you. - Don't rush me. - I didn't mean that. I've mounted many summits. Conquered them all. Sir! I'm over here! To think a summit still peaks my interest! I'll need more working expenses. Double. Double? Could I make them in monthly payments then? I'll wire it in full. You don't have to come out. - Good morning. - Not really. Let's go, honey. - Don't talk to him. - Why not? - He's creepy. - Why? I just think he's weird. - A wife-beater in winter? - He's looks fit, though. - I'll do it. - Jesus! I can do it. I want to do it. How did you get here? - I'll start everything today. - Thank you. You're going all out this time? But she didn't seem too responsive. Once her hate turns into passion, she'll think it's fate. No woman can resist a dramatic turn of emotions. Extra small and 32A, right? - You're making me uncomfortable. - Hush! Just answer me. 32A? Almost nothing there? What are you doing? - So you're not into BDSM. - Huh? - True fanatics react differently. - Oh. Pinch me. - Yes. - I'm sorry, but... Can you do it without being physical? - Platonic? - Yes. I know it's hypocritical, but I'm not ready for... Platonic. An intellectual and refined interaction. Communication on a higher, above-the-waist level. - It can be enjoyable. - Yes, so enjoy it and keep... - But I'd love to explore her in bed. - Excuse me? I bet she'd be spectacular deep inside. The bed doesn't satisfy her and she likes to lead. You said you liked platonic, and now you're talking all filthy. You're the one that's filthy. Isn't it a sexless marriage? Can you get it up? She gets depressed and cries a lot? Yes! And she gets so cranky. - Ten days since her period. - I think so. But she used the Chanel perfume for only three days. That's too short. - A light flow will cause hysteria. - I see. Did you know she's constipated? Is she? A short white crescent means bad organs. - How do you know all this? - I've seen her three times now. - You think I wasted all that time? - No. - What about her family? - They're not very close. - Was it the marriage? - Her father really hates me. - So she ran away? - She set fire to the house. Just a little bit. A tough opponent. Va-va-voom. - Has she ever cheated? - Never. You just never found out. - She's not that kind of woman. - Are you sure? - I seem to know her better. - She's not like that! - We'll see. - Over here. Send me a list. - Everything you know about your wife. - Why? WHAT SHE LIKES - Everything you know about your wife. - Why? WHAT SHE LIKES - You want an intensive operation? - Of course! - You want an intensive operation? - Of course! How many sleeping pills? When she sleeps, wakes up, what she eats. The color of her poop. How often she washes. Color of underwear, lace or silk. If she masturbates. Her favorite position. Political views. UNEXPECTED SEX DESSERT DURING INTERCOURSE Favorite sports, singer, actor, hobbies, et cetera. Write down everything! What movies does she constantly watch? What books does she like? Write it all down! Everything you know about your wife! Tell me everything, if you want freedom. Are you throwing that out? Why? Can't I? You shouldn't throw that out. That's priceless stuff. That's limited edition Haviland porcelain. Now you're gonna report me for recycling porcelain? It's a crime to throw out something that's not garbage. It's garbage to me, so just leave me be! Wait! Why? Why do you keep getting in my way, every time I try to get over her? Why? Would you like some tea? - I'm a Casanova. - Right. I never wanted to be... - I ended up this way somehow. - I see. Would you like to keep them? I've wanted that collection, but I don't do secondhand. It looks like there's a story behind them. - I'll do the dishes. - That's okay. Goodbye. Why won't he answer the door? - I'll make another glass. - That's okay. I actually don't like coffee. - My Columbian farm closed after the FTA. - I see. That's why... - I always wash it down like this. - You should've told me. It's manners. I don't keep quiet, but I try to stay polite. Have a seat. An apple slice will make it taste better. You have so many plates for a single man. I made them for someone, but now I'm using them alone. - I guess she liked tableware. - She cherished them. And the moments we shared, eating together. - A bit of gin is good for insomnia. - I see. Please wash the cup when you're done. - Is this Mr. JANG Sung-ki? - Yes? - I call from Woori Bank. - I don't think so. - Your bank information leaking. - You won't con anyone sounding like that. - What is account number? - You should learn proper Korean first. - You give me number! - Put some effort into it. - Goddamn it. - You're not trying hard enough! - Don't you understand Korean? - The "Korean dream" isn't that easy, okay? - These damn foreign bastards... - Shut up, Julia. Don't make me mad! You stupid... - You speak French so well. - Oh. I lived there about five years. Because I loved Edith Piaf. I was young and rash. Moving to Paris because of French chansons. I like chansons too. And French novels. You don't seem like the Werber type. More like Alain de Botton or Guillaume Musso. Maybe Anna Gavalda on rainy days? Sounds about right. You're quite beautiful when you smile. But you already know that. Men don't find me appealing. They don't like outspoken women. I was only popular for the first semester. By the end of the year, I'd be fighting with all the boys. My nickname was "Two Months". What's your name? - I'm not trying to flirt. - I'm YEON Jung-in. - You're not going to like me anyway. - Of course not. That's what I mean. That's why I'm comfortable around you. Because I know you won't fall for me. And that's why I can tell you that you're beautiful Especially those ankles. - The man next-door... - Yeah? - What? - Nothing. What is it? - He seems okay. - Really? I think I misjudged him. I see. - Who's texting this late at night? - Huh? It's just spam. NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR YOU'LL BE SINGLE IN TWO MONTHS! MIDDAY GANGNEUNG I went to a barbecue place recently. - And I was so shocked! - Why? There was a pink female pig on their sign, wearing a white apron and dancing on the grill. - I saw it too. - Yeah! She was dancing on the grill and holding a plate of pork. I'm no vegetarian and I love meat, but don't pigs at least deserve some respect? Would she really be dancing on that hot grill, holding up a plate full of her cooked friends? Why aren't you eating? - These signs are making us inhumane. - What's wrong? Why do we overlook these things? We've been used to it since we were young. "Should I eat the head first or the feet first?" We hold a teddy bear while we think that. This isn't healthy. We live in a crazy, disgusting world, and I'm sick of it! - So goodbye! - Goodbye everyone! Smooth transition, Jung-in. - I'm getting better at it. - You're great! - Jung-in! - Oh my! - Yes, CHOI? - Come on! - It's snowing, so let's get a drink. - You want to? - Just give me one hour. - Never mind. - I hate waiting. - Jung-in! - What are you doing here? - I'll give you a ride home. See you tomorrow, CHOI. - But I know a great place. - Bye! Tomorrow? Damn it. I'd love to get a drink. Since it's snowing, let's go for a ride. That's the worst idea ever. - Why are you laughing? - I wonder why I like you so much. - I heard your show today. - Oh. You know I'm married. It's not a crime to like someone as a person. Can I milk you? How cute! I think cows deserve respect, so I get my own milk. You're so good at it. - I'm not good at anything. - Do you like ballet? Watching it, at least. I did ballet for twenty years. - Finger ballet. - Oh. Would you like to see? Such limber fingers... - Jung-in. - Yes? I'll start getting ideas if you keep staring at me like that. - I'm married, you know. - Things like that don't stop me. I'm not the kind of man who cares about such things. - Would you like to milk her? - Me? - Like this? - Roll it down. - You're a natural. - It's working! I'm just a lone male wolf. If I find a female I like, nothing stops me. All the rules, ethics, and morals made by man... They never matter in the end. Let them live their way and I'll live mine. Is that selfish? - It is. - Use both hands. I'm just staying true to my instincts. That's the kind of person I am. I don't mean I'll do that to you, so don't feel uncomfortable. Because you won't fall for me anyway. You're a natural. Impossible. - She told you everything? - Yes! She said you're great at milking cows. If she was attracted to you, would she be telling me everything? Don't worry. She said you kept imitating that scene from "Ghost", and that it made her feel a bit guilty. What do you take me for? Don't worry! - Are you doing as I told you? - Of course! I'm being as blunt as possible without offending her. I caught it! I did it! I caught it. - You'll catch my wife soon? - Sure! The thing is... - She seems like a great woman. - Pardon? Nice and soft. I visited a sheep ranch recently. Daegwallyeong? I had fun feeding the sheep and walked back down. You wouldn't believe what I found! - Is this lamb meat? - Yes. How many would you like? They were selling lamb kebabs! Next to the stuffed sheep toys and sheep hats and... Right next to them! Only human beings are this hypocritical. You should choose one or the other! WE'RE RIDING HARD Tigers eat sheep. They don't feed them. Mr. LEE! Isn't this your wife? We act nice, loving, and gracious. But when our humanity is questioned, we say we're animals too. That's why I don't believe people who act nice. It's finished now. This was all Jung-in's idea. THE JOY OF SINGLE LIFE We cover up everything. How much of what's inside is sincere or earnest? Really? Is it shallow to want someone attractive or rich? Can't you fall for someone's money like you fall for their personality? People are attracted to different things. Money makes you bite, but the person reels you in. Then is such a love immoral? Imagine a loser that's rich. Money can change the way you see him, right? Then he doesn't seem to look so bad. But if you're only staying for the money, that's just disrespectful to the loser, and you're making yourself into a bigger loser. Then what made you fall for your husband? My husband deserves his privacy, so I won't discuss that. Privacy, eh? She never cared about my privacy before. - Your wife is adorable. - Then you try living with her. Come on. - Do you guys like this show? - It's the best show these days. - Pretty interesting, isn't it? - Of course! Jung-in! Fifteen pages of comments today. Really? The ratings are through the roof! Half of the comments are insults. It's too early to celebrate. I see. Drinks are on me today. Next time. Why? - I have plans. - I'm free. - Who do you keep meeting? - No one. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. That sign used to have a dancing pig on it, but they changed it recently. - I see. - You know why? Because of your show, Jung-in. You're changing the world. Come on. Don't laugh. This is how change happens, with one person at a time. - You called me to show me that? - To encourage you. So you'll keep changing the world for the better. I'm buying today. What do you feel like? - Kimbap! - Kimbap? But without pickled radishes. No pickled radishes? I hate pickled radishes. How can food be a fluorescent color? Pickled radishes and eggplants, they're just not natural colors. The hot pink color on crab sticks is also pretentious. It's trying too hard to look appetizing. - I hate that. - So do I. I feel like I should be sick when I'm eating congee. - Raw oysters look like phlegm. - Yeah! - I hate shellfish. - Why? They're just bugs from the sea. They don't look any different from cockroaches. - But people who eat bugs are savages? - Yeah, who says you can't eat bugs? That's what I mean! Once I got past that bias, they weren't so bad. Kimbap tastes best at an amusement park. It's like revisiting your childhood. More so because the park is deserted like this. It's like being in a moment frozen in the past. Finding an old box that you had forgotten about. I'll open that box for you. - My heart beats for you. - What? You're driving me crazy. - No, I'm already crazy. - Wait. I'd even give up my life, if I could get inside you! The lyrics to the chanson playing right now. Oh, I see. Jung-in! - What did you think I meant? - Nothing. Isn't it nice to be at a place like this? Straight out of a soap opera. Oh my! - Wait here, Jung-in. - Pardon? I'll be right back. - You're leaving me here? - No, no. If we miss each other, wait for me at the gate. Shit! Hi there! - Fancy running into you here! - What brings you here? - What a coincidence! - I know! - You come here often? - Very often. - Sir. - Come on. Were you following me? - You wanna die? - No. I was just curious how things were coming along. You don't trust me? - Trust me. - Of course I trust you! You let your curiosity damage my pride? - Shit! - That hurts! - I almost have her. - Are you sure? - If she starts being nice, ignore her. - Okay. The nicer she is, - the more she wants me. - Are you for real? I have fragile joints! You'll pull my arm out! I'm sorry. - You can't have sex, you hear me? - We're not... Don't badger her about where she's been all day. - And no text messages! - Come on! Just don't touch me! - You work out? - A little. - Don't make her feel guilty. - Okay! - Mark my words, all right? - I will. Mark them! What the hell? Hey! What took you so long? It was number two. Somebody help! - Who's there? - Oh my! You can't be in here! Get back here! Help me! - What are you up to? - Just work. - Why are you smiling? - Huh? It felt strange to say that I'm working on something. What about dinner? Oh, sorry. Gotcha! Have a seat. I just have to heat it up. It's embarrassing. - You wanted to show me before. - I'm taking the show seriously now, and it's making me sort of embarrassed. I want to show it to you when it's finished. You look so happy. - I am! - About what? About work. I love it. What did you do today? I did the broadcast. Got ready for tomorrow's show. - Took a walk. - That's all? Why are you humming now? - Let's listen to some music. - Answer me first. Tell me what you did today. Come on. Do you remember back when we first met? When we were dating in Japan. Why do you ask? I keep thinking about those days recently. I was pretty back then, and you were so charming, and we were beautiful. I keep thinking about those days. You do? Hey. Am I still pretty? Yes. Then will you kiss me? Will you kiss me? Huh? - Wait. - What? - Someone is calling. - Don't answer it. Sorry, honey. Jung-in! Honey! Don't answer it, Jung-in. I'm so sorry. I have to step out. Where are you going? - Problem with tomorrow's show. - What? Don't wait up. Hey! Come on! How could you lie to me? Aren't you excited? You don't look excited. I'm going on public radio? You and me, we're going to Seoul! - They'd hear me nationwide? - Even on Dokdo! - Honey! - Congratulations. - Now I'm left all alone. - What are you talking about? Pack your bags. Really? You're our head writer! I was afraid I'd die here, an old maid all alone. Is it okay if I go? Of course! - Right? - Sure. Looks like you put up my curtain blinds for nothing. - Why didn't you tell me? - Huh? Oh, her. It was a long time ago. - You even put up her blinds for her? - That was nothing. Sure it wasn't. I told you to stop doing that. Not being able to refuse doesn't make you a good person. People will get used to it. They'll start asking you for ridiculous favors. So I lent her a hand! Why can't I? You hate everyone I know. My family, my friends, even my colleagues. You want me to cut myself off from the world like you? You think you're so honest? - Why are you getting mad? - I'm your husband, why can't I? How come you can do whatever and I can't do a thing? You're sick and tired of me, is that it? What do you want? A divorce or something? I'm going straight to Seoul. What's so bad about how I live? - I never thought it'd be this easy. - No. It's too early to be sure. It won't end there. She'll regret it soon and come back to you. You can't take her back. She's trying to deny her feelings. It's a dangerous phase. I don't see the need for you to go after her. I'll be living alone soon, so you can probably stop now. And I'm honestly running out of money now. - A change of heart? - Excuse me? - So you want her back now? - No, that's not it. - Why the hell would I? - Fine. You don't have to pay me. I must finish what I started. My reputation is at stake. It's my final seduction. You're not getting any funny ideas, are you? - Everything will be over soon. - Already? It's one or the other. She'll settle for you for a while, or devote herself to me. Either way, you'll have your freedom soon. Just one thing, sir. Could you try to talk a bit nicer to me? It's rather offensive to say she's "settling" for me. Did I say that? Sorry, honey. I forgot that you were sensitive. My apologies. Sung-ki! I'm alone! All alone. Push your chest forward. Tighten your groin. Open up your chest. Stretch your leg out a bit more. - Her hand is moving up! - Wait... and go! This is YEON Jung-in for the Morning Ambush! Excuse me? I'm here to speak for people unable to speak for themselves. You're my first customer, Professor. Your identity will be protected, and your voice will be changed. I'll be gone after I say a few words. Are you ready? - Why are you doing this to me? - Doesn't matter if you're not ready. Your students weren't ready when you fondled their asses. Shut up! - And even their privates! - My goodness! - Where is KIM? - You mean your assistant? Your handsome male assistant! - You picked him for his looks? - Goodness gracious! Artists do all sorts of sick things and package it as art, but what makes them so special and praiseworthy? - KIM! - Show me why you're so special, ma'am! KIM! Whether it's a man, woman, a priest or the president molesting you, you still want to kill them just the same! Your wife is becoming a celebrity! Nonsense. No one listens to the radio. Why couldn't he speak out on his own? Because! GRUMPY The professor could've ruined his future career. Enjoy your time molesting students and making filthy art while it lasts. IT'S SNOWING LIKE CRAZY HERE. GOOD SHOW TODAY. IT'S SNOWING LIKE CRAZY HERE. GOOD SHOW TODAY. Best of luck to you. IT'S SNOWING LIKE CRAZY HERE. GOOD SHOW TODAY. - Mr. LEE! - Yes, sir. - How are the test preparations? - They're going well. Tell your feisty wife I'm a fan of her show. YEON JUNG-IN THE BITING BEAUTY Tell your feisty wife I'm a fan of her show. YEON JUNG-IN THE BITING BEAUTY What a woman! "The Biting Beauty"! What a woman! "The Biting Beauty"! What is that, sir? What are you doing here? Whose car is this? I bought it. Thought it'd be a nice change. But a beginner driving at night alone? Did you put up a "beginner driver" sign? No. Why is your wing mirror folded? You should've told me first before buying a used car! I just picked something that I could afford. But it was a bit scary. I almost died a dozen times on my way here. Here's some food. I can get by on whatever is in the fridge. Doo-hyun. I'm sorry about that day before. I thought about it and... I think I had a lot of problems. But like how I started to drive again, I'm gonna start dealing with my problems. Face my dreams and hopes. Muster up some courage. Then I could be a half-decent wife, don't you think? Wait a second. - Let's go inside. - I should get back for the broadcast. It's still dark out. Go in the morning. I have a confession to make. - I slept with someone. - What? In my dream. Goddamn it. Who was it? - I don't know. I didn't see his face. - So? Did you like it? I don't remember. It's just that... - It was the first time since we got married. - Congratulations. Good night. I should go now. Just go in the morning. It's dangerous at night! Don't speed! I found some issues you could report on. What do you think? Think of me as a whore. Excuse me? It was a long time ago. - It's the first line of a novel I wrote. - Oh. It somehow won at a literary contest. I showed it to my dad, but he threw it in the trash. - Oh no. - He said that's the fate of a writer. - He meant I should quit. - I see. I was young and emotional, so I burned the manuscript. But then it really caught on fire. - And he thought it was his fault... - Pardon? It's nothing. So then you quit everything and got married? I thought I'd be happy enough just living with him. - But then we couldn't get pregnant. - Oh dear. I always fail whenever I put effort into something. I decided to stop trying, instead of failing all the time. Then seven years passed by. Seven years. What's the worst thing you've ever done? The absolute worst. Poppy. I lost hold of Poppy. I lost her in the ocean. Sung-ki. Sung-ki? NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and dial again. He's lost his mind! He's gone mad. Du-hyun. You don't even like to drink, so you must be feeling lonely. What's the house like without me? I've been meaning to say something. Would you hear me out over a drink? We've been struggling for a while and... What I wanted to say is... Let's go to the hospital again. Let's stop being scared. I'm ready to face it now. I want us and our baby to fill the house you built. We'll make it the happiest house in the world. We're already here. I guess you'll go inside and we'll say goodbye. But would you remember this moment for me? - My memory isn't as sharp these days. - Fine. - What time is it now? - It's... Three past eleven. Do you hear the watch ticking? Tick, tock. You hear that? Yes. On January 15th, 2012. Three minutes past eleven. I've spent this minute with you. I'll remember this precious minute. I can never deny it. It's already in the past. Whenever it turns three past eleven at night, you'll think of me. Days of Being Wild. You're good at dancing too. - You always seem to know what I like. - Because we have a connection. You know what? We slept together in my dream. I feel embarrassed. What for? It was just a dream. That's bad! It's not right. You should forget it. But I feel much closer to you now. Still, you should forget it. It's absurd. Gosh. Good night. Woah. Are you okay? It's like those classic movies. I feel like I jumped inside one of those old movies. At the climax of the film, the leading lady drinks wine on the street. The extra stands right about here, and he's going to serenade the actress. Although she's embarrassed, she says this because she's nice. Why not? All right. Let me ask you one thing first. There's no such thing as chance or fate, right? But this extra feels like all these coincidences are fate. So he's going to delete her number and erase his memories of her, before he falls deeper for her. Every day with you Lying in the morning sun Every day with you Waking up to you Every day with you Just me and you Every day with you Sharing secrets for two Early morning in the rainy streets Under the sunset streaking the sky Everything surrounding us two I want to share it with you Every day with... What the hell are you doing? You tried to kill me! - I just felt like killing you. - What? Please forget what I asked you to do. I don't want to lose my wife. I'm really sorry. She's starting to change, thanks to you. She's cheerful again, now that she's working. She's a whole new person. I'm getting butterflies like when we first met. We're destined to be together, sir. Please understand. No, it's you that's changed. She's a woman who can change people and the world. So you understand? I'm really sorry. Hey, what's wrong? What's the matter? Sir? What's the matter? Huh? - I fell in love. - What? With who? Your wife. My heart... It hurts so bad. - But you said you're incapable of love! - I fell in love. I'm... - The notorious Casanova in love! - What in the... - You'll walk away, right? - No. - I can't. - What? - I have to have her. - Are you insane? She's my wife! A wife you tried to get rid of! You have no right! The law! - The law says she's still my wife! - Go ahead. Take it to court. I finally found love again. You think I'll let her go? If you get in my way, I'll have to play dirty too. I'll show you just how filthy a man in love can get! But first, I'll tell her how you hired me to seduce her! Yeah, I'm completely insane. And now I'm really gonna let loose. Don't come near me! - I won't lose her to a scumbag like you! - Lose her? She's my wife! What's that? You're scared, aren't you? You should be terrified. What the... Mother fucking. Fucking bastard. Platonic? My ass! I'm the lone wolf! You watch me! Fuck! Don't come near me! What are you doing here? I missed you. Go back with me. What do you say? Why, all of a sudden? Gosh, my head. Did you drink? - Can you smell it? - Yeah, it's bad. I'm sorry. I have something to tell you, Jung-in. - Didn't the house shake just now? - Huh? - It didn't? - Should I come in with you? - Why? - You said it gets lonely inside. No, I'm okay. Hey, Jung-in. That was an earthquake, wasn't it? It struck in Sichuan, China. How is it down there? I'm back in Seoul right now. Then come quick to the office. It's chaos over here. Kwang-shik, I'm in the middle of... If this thing blows, then this whole region is in danger! But that wouldn't happen in Korea, right? I've thought about it and I'd like to help you out. With what? You can have my position down at Gangneung. - I'm getting remarried. - With that woman? Are you insane? I'm back with my wife. That's great. Then you can spend your second honeymoon there. - You know she works in Seoul. - Make her settle down there. I can't take her dreams away from her. I won't mess it up this time. I want to support her. - Goddamn it. - What's with you? - Is it the earthquake? - No, it's that crazy asshole. And I don't even know where the hell he is! Every day with you Lying in the morning sun Yes, remember me? I'm just calling to... To report someone missing. His name is JANG Sung-ki. Yes, that Casanova. I can't reach him. Maybe you can trace his location? Open up! Open the door! Open up or I'll kill you! Open the door! - Baby, I'm pregnant! - Excuse me. I can see you! - I'm dying! - Excuse me! - That guy moved away. - Huh? He doesn't live here anymore. What a waste of time. - Shit. - Hey. - Do you know where he lives? - Why? I have a package for him, but I don't have his address. Of course I know. We're inseparable. Hey. - Do you want to get revenge? - What? The penthouse? So people really live in places like this? But he deserves to be punished for breaking women's hearts. Blow him away, Jung-in. This is YEON Jung-in for the Morning Ambush! We're on our twenty-seventh mission today! Don't worry. Your identity is protected, and your voice will be changed. I'll be gone after I say a few words. Next is the seismic design team for Pyeongchang. Okay! You're out of here! - Are you ready? - Yes. I love your rants. You tell women you love them, then say that you're incapable of... I have never told a woman that I love her. You don't always have to say it out loud. You can tell her with your eyes and your hands. - You make them fall for you and... - Please tell her I'm sorry. And that I cannot see her again, because I've found my true love. - Love isn't a joke. - I believed it was a joke once. But when I lost my first love at sea, I realized something. Love is a prison. A life sentence. Love is useless. I wanted to wreck all the women who ascribe meaning to love. That became useless as well, so I contemplated taking my life. I was clueless. I didn't know love. But then, someone taught me what it all meant. She blew me away and I immediately fell for her. I followed her back to Seoul, but I knew I wasn't good for her. I held back my feelings with all of my strength, but with a stroke of fate, we met again. My heart is screaming out that I can't lose her again. That I won't lose her again. What are you saying? He's filthy rich and gorgeous. Who is he? - Are you sure it's him? - Of course. He reminds me of Casanova. There's just something about him. - What about Jung-in? - She's head over heels, of course. What? - Let's not do this segment. - What? I'm grateful to God. For giving me this fated love. EVERY For giving me this fated love. For giving me this fated love. You bastard! Who the hell are you? - Why are you doing this to her? - What are you doing? - Don't look at her, asshole! - What's gotten into you? EVERY DAY WITH YOU EVERY DAY WITH YOU Don't look! EVERY DAY WITH YOU But you put up my curtain blinds! But you put up my curtain blinds! I don't have any cash right now. I'll pay the fine. I'm sorry! Stop! Don't turn on the lights. We've been apart for days and that's all I get? I'm sorry. I'm not in a good mood. I brought cake and wine. Let's... - I might go back to Gangneung. - Really? When? Let's do that. No. Let's talk it over tomorrow. - What's wrong? - Don't ask. I can't explain it. I feel like I've ruined everything. What's wrong? You can tell me about it. What happened? My head is about to explode. I don't know anymore. Just leave me alone for a bit. Is it because of him? - How did you know? - Did he come on to you? - Who told you that? - Is that important? I'm sorry. - So are you considering it? - No! - You're torn up about it. - No, I'm just stressed out So you slept with him? - Get over it. I told him to do it. - What? I asked him to seduce you. Everything he said is a lie! He's just a shameless Casanova! - You asked him to seduce me? - No, I... I thought... It might help our relationship, since you just lock yourself in. So you were sick of me? You wanted me to have an affair, - so you could break up with me? - No, that's not it. Don't lie to me! Damn it. Okay, I just wasn't thinking clearly. I didn't know how to deal with you then. But it's not like that now, and now is what matters! Now? Look at what you've become now! Just look at what we've become! Jung-in. I meant that it's in the past. PD CHOI saw our neighbor tell me how he felt and had a fit. I work with CHOI every day. I was worried that I might have to quit. My head was pounding. I must've seemed easy to him, so I was blaming myself! Wait, then... It's not him? Jesus. I was a bit shaken up by him to be honest. He knew everything that I liked. He listened to what I had to say, and I loved how he supported me. Everything you had together was fake! I get it! Thanks for letting me know. I felt loved for the first time in years, but it was all a lie. Thanks for clearing that up for me! I'm just so grateful. All this time, no one loved me! Jung-in, that's not it. I'm sorry. We'll go to the hospital like you said and have a baby. A baby? What am I, a charity case? - Why are you bringing it up? - No, that's not it. Saying that now is the lowest thing you could do! This is the kind of man that I lived with for seven years? You're making yourself more upset! Don't you dare touch me! It's an earthquake! I'm leaving. This is the safest place you can be! You think I'm safe here? We believed we were safe, but we were not. The streets of Seoul shook last night from tremors of magnitude 4.9. You're tuning into the Morning Ambush. I have some unfortunate news today. I hear today is your last day. That's right. I know many of you were shaken up yesterday. Times like these call for consolation, not criticism. Thank you for everything. So who's the last person you'll criticize for us? Today... I have a few words for all the scared losers out there who can't speak their minds and act like cowards. I once met a timid wimp and you won't believe what he did. He paid someone to seduce his wife so he could break up with her! What a class act, huh? If you're stuck in a loveless relationship and can't break up with them, and if you're scheming despicable things like this, don't you dare show your face in front of me. I'll kill you. Wow. People say that I talk too much, and it's always negative. They're right. But isn't that better than not saying a thing? If you're with someone for years, you say less and less. You think you know each other, so there's not much to say. But that's leads to misunderstandings. No one ever truly knows another person. So keep talking to them. Or plug in the blender, the vacuum, or do a load of laundry. Don't let your environment drown in silence. A lively home is bound to be filled with sound. People call it energy. Getting used to silence is a terrifying thing, but don't ever say negative things like me. The other person could get sick of you. We enjoy everything you say, Jung-in. I'm getting a divorce. What? This is exciting! I'll be on my own again. But I'm going to keep talking. I won't forget who I am. If anyone out there is like me, don't hide away in the silence. Just keep talking. Someone will answer you. That's something I learned through this show. Thank you. - YEON Jung-in is missing now? - Yes, please track her location. - Last time it was JANG Sung-ki... - It's for real this time. Chief, my wife might die if I don't find her! JANG Sung-ki! JANG Sung-ki! JANG Sung-ki! I meant those things I said. I was attracted to you. Sung-ki. Do you know why you're unable to love someone? It's time to let Poppy go. Over there. What's gotten into you? Why did you turn off your phone? I was worried! I just came for my things. I leased an apartment with our savings money. - That's all I need. - But you quit the show. I get a lot of teaching offers, and I can take care of myself. Jung-in. Do you have to do this? It's all my fault. Let's talk this through. You don't like talking with me. Hey! What are you laughing at? Why are you laughing? Stop right now! Oh, Sung-ki! You still don't get it? All I did was treat your wife as a woman again, and you're just a weak, incompetent coward. But she still loved me. It still puzzles me. What do you do when an earthquake breaks everything? You rebuild from the beginning. But stronger this time, eh? You should take your time. There's a lot. No, I need to go today. I'm sorry! I should've taped it better. - Hey, sir! - Excuse me! Can't you see the sign? It's been up for months. I'm sorry, I thought you just moved in. Come on. Give me a better excuse than that. - I've lived here for seven years. - I just never saw you before. Doesn't matter if you put up a polite sign or not. If you subscribed and took the free gift, - then I have to give it to you. - But... I have to do the whole street and now I'm late! Why won't you just listen to me? Isn't this illegal, honey? And my wife almost got injured on that bike! It's not my fault that the lady's clumsy, man! We gave you a bike! Do what you want with it! - Don't talk like that to my wife! - Why are you hitting me? - Get off of me! - You asshole! Get back here! Hey! Don't touch that. I guess I'll throw it away. Maybe I'll spend one last night here. ONE MONTH LATER Hey. Should we go in? Want some gum? That's okay. I'm nervous. I've wanted to ask you something. What? Why did you smile at his flowers? - Flowers? - At that coffee shop. When he first met you and gave you flowers. It's an honor to meet such a beauty. That made you smile. - Because I thought of you. - What? Those were the words you first said to me. Back in Japan, under that table. I smiled because he reminded me of you. We'll resume after lunchtime. Excuse me! You should've told us earlier, instead of making us wait! It's fine. Did you eat yet? CABOODLES OF NOODLES Yes? Go ahead. - Kimchi udon, please. - We don't have that right now. - What about the spicy noodles? - Don't have that either. - Then what do you have? - Everything besides noodles. The name of the restaurant is Caboodles of Noodles. What else are we supposed to eat at a noodle place? - Let's go somewhere else. - It's a long story. - Our delivery was late and... - Then what do you have? Excuse me? - Are you ignoring us now? - Huh? What the hell is this? - Just two of anything, please. - Anything? What? Just anything! Don't you know what "anything" means? Are you deliberately trying to mess with me? Sheesh... I'm sorry. I lost it. - Why are you yelling at her? - I didn't mean to. It's not her fault. - They only get paid four dollars an hour. - I just... I read it on the door. It gets raised to five dollars after three months. We're all hanging in there in this wretched world. You shouldn't cause trouble over a little thing like that. Not causing trouble isn't easy. It actually takes a lot of effort. Why are you laughing? I missed it so much. Your criticism. Your voice. I used to get so embarrassed by your complaining, but I... I didn't know you were just lonely. I realized it once I became lonely. Stop! You embarrassed me earlier. - I can see you smiling. - I'm not. - You smiled just now. - No, I didn't. I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Tremors have been over for months. I didn't mistake anything. I didn't. You silly. Hey. It's really an honor to meet such a beautiful woman. Let me buy you lunch. YEON Jung-in and LEE Doo-hyun! YEON Jung-in and LEE Doo-hyun? YEON Jung-in and LEE Du-hyun! The rain is falling outside. It falls equally on the good and the bad. On those who don't deserve love, those who don't appreciate it. Love rains on everyone as well. Then why avoid it? If you're hurting from the temptations of love, the only way to stop it is to give in. Wow. Here's another listener. - A housewife in love with a young man. - Oh my god. Pokrati Takara from South Africa. - Is she on the line? - Yes. - A translator is standing by. - I know a little Afrikaans. You're tuning into sounds of my girlfriend kissing Mr. JANG. I'm not a good kisser. .But I see that Mr. JANG is very skilled at it. And now, they're having sex. Mr. JANG and... You mother fucker! Hey! Die you assholes! Hey! Somebody call the police! You fucking little...
