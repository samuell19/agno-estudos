[panting] [Gavin] Whoo! Whoa! [grunts] Zippin' through! Haha! Hee-ya! Nailed it. [exclaims] Nice kitty! - Watch it! - Comin' through! Matthew. Matthew! - Huh? - [screaming] Gavin! Gotta make it to the top! Catch! Got it! Grab on! [angry meow] [grunting] - Little help? - There. Thanks. [both] Yeah! - Let's get outta here! - Right behind ya! [Matthew sighs] That was close! [Gavin] Life's dangerous down here, but it's all we've got for now. Yeah, home sweet home. [Gavin] Not bad. We're stocked up! I have to say these sausages, are amazingly fantastic! Check this out! Oh! You made it! Nice! - Thanks. - You could be a real pro! Think so? I wish we lived somewhere cool where I could play ball on a real team! Yeah, I know. That would be really cool. I wanna see the world and go on an adventure! Lucky number one! Hey! Huh? Ow! [groans] Ow! Hey! Huh? Look at that. That's the biggest pond I've ever seen. What? That's not a pond Gavin. - It's the ocean! - The ocean? What's that? I've never seen it myself but they say it's supposed to be beautiful. It is. Wow! It looks amazing. I've gotta see that ocean for myself. [seagulls squawking] That's it! Let's go on an adventure to the ocean! Yeah, sure, right. We'll just run off on an adventure to the ocean, wherever that is. You and your big dreams. I'd rather take a nap. Hey! Gavin! Hey! - Huh? - Come on! Wait, where are you going, Gavin? On an adventure. To the ocean! But we don't even know where the ocean is. Are you sure about this Gavin? Hey! Where's your sense of adventure? Come on! If we keep following this river it should lead to the ocean, right? Big blue ocean here we come! [Matthew] How far do you think it is? [Gavin] I don't know, but we're gonna find out! [thunder rumbles] Well, it looks like the river ends here. Where's the ocean? [Matthew] Who knows. But one thing's for sure, I'm starvin'! [panting] - I miss our sausages. - I'm hungry, too. Huh? What's that? [sniffing] [gasps] - Gavin! - What? I can smell something yummy! Are you sure? My nose always knows. Let's go! Wait. Go where? Huh? Well, that sure put some pep in your step. This way! Over here! - Ahh! - [Gavin] Well? Can you see anything? [grunting] - Now what? - Ah-ha! This way. [Gavin] If you say so. - There it is! - Now you're talkin'! - Woo-hoo! - Yeah! All right! [indistinct chatter] [both] Wow! [Matthew] I've never seen so many mice! Amazing! Hey. Huh? - [Matthew] Oh, yeah! - Matthew! - Sorry. Oh! - [giggling] - Huh? - It's alright. Hot chowder comin' thru! [mouse] Over here! Yes! Make way for the main course! Huh? Fresh fish! - Hey, I'll take one, too! - Sure. Thanks a lot! - [shriek] - Huh? Oh, no. He's eating the boss's fish! [all exclaim] We caught this rat red handed. - The nerve! - Huh? You gotta be kidding! You're in big trouble! - We're takin' you to the boss! - The Boss? Yeah! [grunts] Hold it! Boss! Look what we got here! We caught this dirty rat helpin' himself to your dinner! - [mouse 1] No way! - [mouse 2] Uh-oh! [security mouse] What do you want us to do with him boss? - Who is he? - [yelps] This fool took a bite outta your fish! [gasps] Huh? - Buddy! - Hey, what's goin' on here? Hey! Are you in cahoots with this guy? No. There must be some kind of misunderstanding. No one touches the boss's food. It's disrespectful! Look, it was a mistake alright? A mistake? A mistake you're gonna pay for! [Matthew] Take it easy, Gavin! - [Gavin] Yeah, you better run. - Huh? Oh-no. Ah! [boss] Hey, you. What ship did you take to get here? That depends on what a ship is. - Rusty. - Huh? I'd say it's rather obvious. These two are not the ship-mouse type. Is that right? No scent of salt on their fur. They smell of humans. If I'm not mistaken you're city mice, aren't you? They're city mice? - [laughter] - [mouse 1] City mice! [mouse 2] Yeah, a couple of cowardly city mice! - Ya got a problem with that? - That's enough! Take it easy. I didn't realize you were cowardly little city mice. Listen everyone! The coward can go but the fish eater is mine. [laughter] [grunting] Wait just a cotton-pickin' minute you big oaf! [shrieks] He's my friend, and I'm not gonna let anything happen to him. Got it? You're a bully! If you want a piece of him you gotta go through me first! [laughter] Is that right kid? You sure got guts! You bet I do, I'm Gavin! - Leave the boy alone. - Why not Grayson? He wants to tangle. You wanna fight? - Then let's do it. - I'm not gonna hold back! - [laughter] - Ridiculous. He'll never win against Rusty. No kidding, right? [mouse] Care to make a wager on the match? - [both] Huh? - Let's see what these dice say. Two to one, I'm goin' with the city mice. What? Are you kidding? He hasn't got a chance. [chuckles] That little pipsqueak will never win against Rusty! [scoffs] I'm goin' with the two city mice. No way! He'll never win. [screaming] [laughing] Are ya satisfied now, kid? I'm just warming up! [grunts] Hey! Where do ya think you're goin'? Heads up! [wailing] Oh, dear. Hasn't the boy had enough already? Are ya still warmin' up? Are you kiddin? Heck no! I'm just gettin' started! [grunts] That's enough for now. Face it, you lost! Haha! I haven't lost yet! [sighs] No matter how you cut it, you lost! - See? - Oh, no, I haven't. - I'm not giving up! - Hey! Let go! - I won't let go! - Get off! - Now! Ya understand? - No! Huh? [cheering] [chuckles] Alright, Gavin! Oh! Sorry. [laughter] [Rusty] Not bad, kid! Well, you're pretty brave for a city mouse aren't ya? - Thanks. - Hey. What do you say? How bout joinin' the ship's crew? I don't know about that, but if you ever come into town, I'll be happy to show you around the city, okay? [laughing] You're a funny one, kid! [mouse] Help! Emergency! This mouse is in trouble! [mouse 2] What is it, Bobo? Oh, dear! - Tell us what happened. - This little kid. - He... - I've gotta find the ship mice. [groans] - Father, we need to get help! - It's no use. We don't know if such ship mice can even fight weasels! Much less if we'll be able to find them. We have to try. We've got to find the ship mice! If we don't find help soon, we're done for! [gasps] [all] Huh? He's awake! How is he, Grayson? I'm afraid he has a high fever. Bobo, see to it that he gets some fresh water. Sure, right away. How do you feel? You were talking in your sleep, you know. Please help us! I beg of you! Please help us save the mice on the island. It's all right. Now just slow down and tell us what happened. - Okay. - For starters, what's your name? I'm Chester, and I come from Dream Island. I came here to ask for your help because I was sure that the famously brave ship mice would be able to help us. Oh, yeah? Are the ship mice really that famous? Of course we are! Us ship mice are mice among mice! And always there to help those in need. - Isn't that right boys? - [all] Yeah! Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you! I had always heard that Dream Island was a place of peace and harmony. No, not anymore. Everything is completely different now. The way things are going, the weasels will drive all of us off the island for good! - Weasels? - Weasels have been known to attack mice at times before. But how could they possibly drive away all of the mice? [gasps] Tell me, Chester, was their leader a white weasel? Yes. He was. The leader of their clan is Winston the white weasel! The white weasel Winston? [thunder] [all whimpering] The white devil himself. Winston! Huh? Who's afraid of some weasel? Chester's people need our help. You're the famous ship mice, right? We are, but this ain't no average type of weasel, it's Winston! - Sorry, but I gotta get going. - Huh? Hey, wait! Where are you guys goin'? Wait, I... Why won't any of your men help this mouse out? I thought you were all supposed to be so brave but you're not! Be quiet! You know nothing about this at all! I wanna help, believe me. But I can't. Did any of those scars come from this white weasel? I dropped the ball. I turned tail and ran away like a scared little church mouse. [grunts] [sobbing] It's no use, if you can't help us, nobody can. I know it's dangerous. I'm sorry I asked you for the impossible. I just feel so bad for everyone on my island. No one can survive Winston's gang. It's all right. Don't worry. Huh? I'll go with you, Chester. - Huh? - Huh? Your people are in trouble. I'll help you. But, Gavin, we just came here to check out the ocean, right? - Come on, hop on! - Huh? - Okay, thank you. - I'm going Matthew. Wait a minute! Are you sure about this? Don't go! Gavin! Come back! Oh, dear. [Chester] This is it. This ship will take us all the way to Dream Island. - [Gavin] You sure? - [Chester] I think so. Careful. Now where to? We have to find a way inside. But how? [humming] Oh, no! We gotta hide and fast! - Father. - Hm? Poor little guy. [ship horn blasts] [yawns] - The ship's leaving. - Huh? It looks like your fever's finally all gone. - Feelin' any better? - You should stay. Huh? What do you mean? Tomorrow morning when we get to the island you should just stay on the ship. What? Don't be silly! I'm worried. I mean... There's nothing you can do for us all on your own. - Then you'd be alone! - It's alright. At least I'll get to see the island again. [Bobo] Surprise! [laughter] - What are you doing here, Bobo? - I brought you some breakfast! Good mornin'! You must be hungry. How bout some squash? Or a yummy tomato! Huh? Oh. Thanks a lot Bobo, thank you. It looks delicious. Um... I have a question. Yes, what is it Bobo? I was up thinking about you all night long. - How would you feel if I helped you? - Huh? I wanna go with you and Gavin all the way to Dream Island and help you out. - Huh? - Yeah. Wow, that's great news, Bobo! That's great! - [Chester] Thank you! - [laughter] [mouse] Well, well, whadaya know! Clumsy ol' Bobo who's always in the way thinks he's gonna be a hero and save him! Yeah, right, that'll be the day! [laughter] That's not very nice ya know. At least he showed up! [Rusty] What kind of tiny old boat is this? Ahoy! - Couldn't you find any better transportation than this? - Rusty? Hide in the cargo and get some humans to carry you on board. That's the most efficient way to get on a ship. - Remember that. - The old man! - The name's Grayson. - Fantastic! We're practically an army with you guys here. - Yeah! - Well, I'm afraid it's only the two of us. I'm sorry none of our men would come with us here. [mouse] You wanna face Winston without your men? If you say so. Suit yourself. It seems you had the same idea didn't you? [chuckles] You know me, I always go with what the dice tell me. - Ha! - Ha! I suppose some things never change. One, two, three, four, five, six. Wow! We've got a whole team now! Hold on a second! Don't go counting me in with you! - [laughter] - [Bobo] Sorry bout that. Thank you for all of your support! - We're here for you, Chester! - Thanks! - [all gasping] - [Rusty] We're launching! - Yeah, you're right! - Hold on, everyone! [Bobo] We're trying! The ship is heading out into the open. The waters will get even rougher. Ah! You call this rough? It's perfect for an ocean crossing, huh? Ocean? Did I just hear you say ocean? Are we on the ocean right now? Of course we are! What do ya think ships float on? Wow! My eyes! So bright! Now, open up your eyes slowly and check it out. There it is kid, the big blue ocean. [Gavin] It's so big. And beautiful! [laughter] I agree. That it is, kid! I've never seen anything like it! - What's that! - [Rusty] They're flying fish! Wow! What about those guys? [Rusty] They're just seagulls, kid! [Gavin] Wow! As far as the eye can see. This is all part of the big beautiful ocean! Amazing! I love it! All right! The ocean's ginormous! - Yeah! - I feel like the king of the world! - Unbelievable! - Atta boy! Watch out! - Help! - Gotcha! You're okay now. Don't try that again, you fool! It's dangerous. You'll be history before we get to the island! [Matthew] Hey! Is he okay? - Let him go! - Huh? [Rusty] Well, it looks like your friend decided to join us on deck. Matthew! Hey, buddy! - Are you all right? - Yeah. I looked all over the ship but I couldn't find you anywhere. I wanted to see the ocean, too. - Well, come check it out for yourself then. - [chuckles] - There! - Are you happy now? - Uh-huh. - We made it all the way to the ocean! Of course, it was my idea to come here. Hey, no fair! It's my adventure! [groaning] [laughter] [Gavin] Sorry bout that, Matthew! [Rusty] He'll be alright once he gets his sea-legs! [Grayson] Mm, I see. Show us. On the south side of Dream Island, there's a wide open plain. Right there. We've lived there in peace for generations since the time of our ancestors. Then one day, Winston's clan suddenly appeared out of nowhere! And they started attacking us mice. So we all fled to North Mountain in order to avoid Winston. But it's a rough and rocky place. And there's very little food there. We thought that we'd be safe for awhile. But it didn't last. [growling] - Help us! - What are we gonna do? The weasels terrified us. They drove away over half our people. The few survivors who managed to make it out safely are hiding in a cave here. On this mountain. Without any help, they could all end up starving to death. [gasps] Starving? I can't even imagine it. Then why are the weasels going so far just to get rid of the mice? [Rusty] Who knows with that white weasel, Winston. He's probably just doing it for the thrill of the chase, that's all! Huh? Oh, dear. [Gavin] We've got to find a way to help those mice. I wonder how far away it is. I've never been on an island before. The sky is incredible out here. I've never seen stars so bright before. Yeah. Beautiful. [screaming] Hey, Gavin! [groans] Knock it off! You'll wake everyone up! They're probably too excited to get any sleep tonight. Yes. And I fear we might not get much sleep either. How will we ever find a way to defeat Winston? Frankly, it scares the tail off of me. - Hey, Gavin! - [Rusty] Only thing I know is... There's something about that little pipsqueak and his stubborn bravery. We were all drawn to him. We've got to do this. It could be our destiny. [chuckling] Yes. I hope that's true. - Hey, I see land up ahead. - Huh? Check it out! That's home. I just hope we're not too late. Alright! Let's go! [all] Yeah! - [Chester] This is it! - [Gavin] Oh, goodie! - [Rusty] Let's do it! - [Gavin] I can't wait! [Matthew] I hope we can we can get lunch soon! [grunting] So, is that North Mountain? - [Chester] Yes. - [Gavin] It's huge! The real question is, how in the world are we gonna get there? The journey will be treacherous. We must not be seen. The old cat and mouse game, huh? I think you're probably right about that, Grayson. [Grayson] Pardon me. [groans] [Bobo] Well? What do you see Grayson? Oh. [chuckles] I may have just solved our predicament. [all] Huh? - Hurry! - Quiet! - We're right behind ya! - Come on! - Almost there! - I'm doin' the best I can! - I'll take the left! - I'll take the right! And I'll meet ya in the middle! [laughter] - Come on! - You can do it! [both] One, two... - [grunting] - [whinnying] - Hey! - Yah! North Mountain, here we come! The weasels certainly won't be able to see us now. [Bobo] Yeah, good thinking, Grayson. Hey! Where do you think you're going? Ah, now I can relax! This place is amazing! The sky is so blue, and everything seems so peaceful here. What a beautiful place. Huh? Wow! What kind of flowers are those? [Chester] Those are sago palm flowers. They bloom all over the island this time of year. - They're so incredible! - Yeah! * Look to where * Sago flowers bloom * The sago flowers bloom for us * - Wow! - That's a beautiful song. My sister sang it to me when I was little. It's been around for generations. - Oh, yeah? - Well, let's here it again! * Find your love who's waiting for you * * Here across the ocean blue [scoffs] Really sets the mood for the danger ahead. Please. Chester's been through a lot, and he's finally able to relax for a few moments. Why not let them enjoy it? * I'll be there at your side - Wow! That was really good! - [chuckles] I wonder what we'll be having for lunch? That cloud looks like a shrimp. And there's a lobster, and a crab! - [horn honking] - [groans] Hey, what was that you guys? Uh-oh! We got trouble off the stern! - What? - What does he want? - [Bobo] He wants his cart back! - [Ace] He's movin' fast! What do we do now? Quick! Do something, Gavin! Yeah. Got it. No problem. Gavin, don't do it! That's a bad idea! [screaming] [Ace] Take it easy! Come back, here! [screaming] Give me back my cart! I can't hold on for much longer! [Rusty] Here comes a sharp turn! [all screaming] [Matthew] Watch out! [screaming] [slow-motion yelling] [laughter] [groaning] - Cool! - [Rusty] Everyone okay? I was flying! We didn't fly, we fell on our faces. At least we landed on a sandy beach. I thought we were goners! We got lucky this time, but I'm afraid we're far too visible now. Let's hurry and move up the shoreline. Right. We better get going before it gets too late. Can't we rest here? On this pretty sandy beach. You have to catch me first! [laughter] - You're it! - Let's go! - Hurry everyone! - Yeah! Come on, let's do it! We gotta get there before it gets dark! [Bobo] I'm right behind ya! [Matthew] Hey, wait for me! Hurry! Look how high up I am everyone! Watch where you're going! Ah! We've got company. - Hang on, guys! - Hold on, Bobo! We've got to get beyond the leeward side of the island! - Careful! - Thank you. [whimpering] - Hurry! - Go, Gavin! That's it! [Matthew] He's going to make it! - [Chester] He did it! - [Gavin] Got it! - [Rusty] Move it! - [Gavin] Come on everyone! - [Matthew] Here we come! - [Bobo] Don't look down! [Matthew] How much further is it? [Chester] We're getting closer! It's just up ahead! - There it is! - Look at that. [Gavin] That's a rugged mountain. - [Rusty] It sure is. - It's gigantic! It's sure going to be a hard climb. - Yeah. - Hey, are you alright, Chester? Yeah, I'm good to go, I can do it! That's the spirit. Let's keep going! - Okay. - Huh? I'm done. Just leave me here. I'm beggin you, please. - Come on, Matthew. - [Matthew] No more. Well, can't really blame him. He's been running his tail off. - So, what do you think? - It'll be dark soon. Let's search for some food in this area and then find some place safe to camp. - [Chester] Okay. - Alright, sounds good to me. Let's do it, guys. Gavin and Ace, let's move out. - Oh, man! Fine. - Okay, let's do it. - You wait here, Matthew. - Come back soon with some goodies! [Rusty] Sure, catch! - [Ace] There's nothin' here! - [Grayson] Keep an eye out for nuts, seeds, anything edible. I can't find anything. Hmm... [grunts] I think I'll pass. Ah! There! - [Rusty] You guys find anything? - [Chester] Nope! [Rusty] Well, keep looking. - [yells] - Hey! [all yelling] - [Rusty] What's goin' on? - [Gavin] I don't know! [groaning] Where are we? Gavin, Get up! There's something here. - [Gavin] Weasels? - [Rusty] Keep your guard up. This isn't good. Stay close. Huh? [grunts] Who wants a piece of me? [grunts] - We're trapped. - This isn't good. - Huh? - Heads up! [yelling] Wait! Hold it! Huh? Matthew? Huh? - [Matthew] Uh-oh. - You're mice? Are you alright? - We haven't eaten in a while. - We'll be back with something delicious for you. Yeah! - [laughter] - Here we go! - Right behind you! - Me, too! - Look at that! - Amazing! Please, have as much as you'd like. Delicious! This is the best! So what was going on back there? Did you think we were going to attack you? We have to be cautious. The weasels are always a concern. The weasels? Sounds like they're pretty unsavory. - They're not very handsome like these guys. - [grunts] Tell us the reason why you came to Dream Island, Gavin. We came to save Chester's family. Chester's family? Hmm. You mean the mice that Winston's been after? Mm-hmm. I hope you're not planning on fighting Winston. That would be very dangerous. [sighs] Chester's people are in danger. They won't be safe 'til Winston's gone. That weasel is a monster. He controls an army of weasels who constantly terrorize the island. He hunts us, as well. They've attacked our nests and stolen our eggs! And those left protecting them have perished. We want nothing more then to seek revenge on those weasels. Their thirst for destruction is limitless. Well, then, why don't you join forces with us, Theresa! I wish I could. I can't let any others become Winston's victims. The white weasel's powerful. He's too strong to challenge. Then we're gonna find a way to stop-- Please don't. You can't defeat Winston. No one ever has. [Gavin] Hey, guys! Wake up. [Ace] What's goin' on? - Hey, wake up, Matthew. - [shrieks] Huh? Come on! Okay, but I want to take my fishy. Thanks for everything, Theresa. But we never back down from bullies. [Matthew] Wait for me! [Rusty] Stay together everyone! Be careful, brave mice. Chester, how far to the hideout? It's just through the passage up ahead! We're almost there. - Father! - Chester! Shelly, I brought back the ship mice. Come on! [sobbing] [gasps] Everyone's gone! Where are they? - [Matthew] Poor Chester. - Where's my family? [sighs] [gasps] - Chester... - Gavin, look, over there. Weasel footprints, everywhere. And there's weasel fur. I don't believe it! [sobs] No! Oh, Chester. My mom, my father, and Shelly, they're all gone! We shouldn't have stopped last night. If we had just gotten here earlier. Um, don't you think we should get out of here before the weasels come back and find us, too? Don't tell me you're giving up! It's true. We do need to get out of here, Gavin. It'll be difficult for Chester, but we have got to leave this island as soon as possible. Hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. For all we know they may still be alive. Huh? The weasels have already been here. They won't be back. In my opinion, we should stay here awhile. [all chattering] Alright, Gavin! I agree, we'll stay here a little longer. - [Gavin] Hey, take it easy! - [Rusty] You're alright, kid. I don't know... Well, then, I'll just take a little nap. Doubles again. This is weird. A lucky roll every time. Wow, look at what I found! Beautiful! Are you sure about that? I don't know. [Bobo] I found these beautiful flowers! What do you think, Grayson? These flowers could be a message that someone left for us intentionally. - A message? - I know! She's where the flowers bloom! That's it! Whoa! Look, it's like a dream! [laughter] [Bobo] Where did all these flowers come from? Wow. Huh? Huh? Oh! Hello. Who are you? Uh, I'm Gavin. Gavin, the city mouse. Who are you? [Chester] Shelly! You're okay! - Is that you? - Yeah! - No way! You made it back! - Yeah. - Oh, Shelly! - Chester! I was so worried! When we made it back to the hideout, and you were all gone, I thought I'd lost you forever. We are all safe. It's okay. [Gavin] Fantastic! Did you hear that? Chester's family are all safe, guys! - Alright! - May I ask who you all are? I am Rusty, the head of the ship mice. - Chester came to us for help. - And I am Grayson. - Call me, Ace. - I'm Bobo. - I'm Matthew. - And I'm-- Gavin! You're a City Mouse, aren't you? [chuckles] She's making you blush, Gavin. - I'm Shelly. Thank you so much. - Yeah. So, Shelly, have you and your people been able to secure a new hideout? Thankfully, we have. The weasels started to snoop all around the cave. So we decided to move camp before they could find us. But I never gave up hope in Chester. I always knew he'd come back. - That's why you left the flowers back at the cave. - Mm-hm. Your sister's a very brave and bright young lady, Chester. - I know! - Oh! Thanks! This is it everyone. Just off the coast. - Oh, where? - Right there. [Gavin] Wow. Mice from other tribes have joined us. There are about 80 of us right now. Well, well! It's like a sea fortress. [Bobo] Amazing. An impenetrable sea fortress. Huh? [gasps] - There, that should do it. - Clarence! Hey, Clarence! It's Chester! Chester's come back with Shelly! What? Follow me, guys. Okay? What are ya lookin' at? - We're leaving, now. - Wait. Who's down there? [Grayson] Look! Over there! [Shelly gasps] Owen! - It looks like he's hurt! - We have to help him! - I'll go. - Wait, Gavin. Look! - [all gasping] - [Gavin] Oh, no! - [screaming] - [Grayson] He's in trouble. - [Matthew] That's a weasel! - Oh, no! - A weasel? - Run, Owen! - [grunting] - [snarling] - No! - Careful, Gavin! - Hurry! We've got to save him! - He's crazy. Let go of him! [yelling and grunting] [both] Gavin! Here I come! [laughing] [roaring] [Rusty] Yeah! [both panting] [Gavin] Where'd he go? Did he get away? That hurt. Weasels sure have thick skulls! [all laughing] Amazing. They managed to beat that weasel. [Shelly] It was incredible! They beat the weasel! [Gavin chuckles] It was nothing, really. Thank you, friends. No one's ever defeated Winston's weasels. You're welcome. It was the least we could do. But it was Chester who really brought us here. He's the one who deserves your thanks. - Me? - Way to go, Chester! - Thanks! - You did well. I'm very proud of you, Chester. [giggling] - [mouse] Why is everyone celebrating? - [Chester] Shiloh. You think that getting rid of one weasel solves all of our problems? Yeah, right! Well, you just stirred up a hornets' nest. Shiloh. Winston's gonna find out about this, and then it's just a matter of time! We have to leave now because of you! - Don't be rude, Shiloh. - [groans] So now what? Why should we even listen to you, Clarence? We were just fine on our own, then you had to bring us here! Uh... We all came here because we trusted you. You said, that we can only survive together, didn't you? Well, your advice didn't pan out. - Coming here was a big mistake! - That's right! - You put us in harms way! - Please don't fight. We gotta stick together! [Shiloh] The whole things a bad idea, it'll never work! Come on! Let's get outta here! - Yeah! - [Bobo] Wait! [sighs] [Clarence] That's the island I was telling you about, Shelter Island. They say that long ago our ancestors use to trade with the mice who lived on the island. [Grayson] That means they had to swim across the channel. [Matthew] Ah, I'm not much of a swimmer! I bet that the tides and currents have shifted somewhat over the years. If we could make our way there, we'd have supplies, and we'd finally be free of Winston. It's an ambitious plan. And would it even work? I don't see how we could all possibly make it there. Wait! You can't give up. You're the one who got us here. - That was your idea! Right? - Listen, Shelly, what our people need is a leader who can save them and guide them into the future. Unfortunately, I can't do that. Clarence, I don't think you should beat yourself up about this. [Owen] Weasels! There're weasels out there! Oh, not again! Well, it didn't take 'em very long to track us down, did it? Indeed. Apparently the news of our altercation made it all the way back to Winston. No! It's all my fault! What should we do, Clarence? This could really be the end! [all chattering] You don't have to give up so easily! [all] Huh? If we all work together, I know we can beat Winston! It'll never work, I tell ya! There's no way we can beat them! Actually, we can. This place is surrounded by water. And the climb up is rather treacherous, which makes it a virtual sea fortress for us. If we seal off the entrance and use our height advantage, we could pull this off. [Rusty] Well? What do you say Clarence? Ya wanna give up or do this? [all chattering] Alright. Is this what you want to do? Clarence, I'm willing to take the chance. Owen! Clarence, we're with you too. You have always led us well! Anyone else? I refuse to be bullied by them anymore! Me either! Let's fight back! - Yeah! - Come on! Fine. We agree. We will fight and we ask for your help! You got it! Then we will all fight together! [cheering] And I'll be in charge of the food. I've got other plans in store for you, kid. What do you think we should do, Shiloh? It's too late to do anything now. Winston will likely attack us from those caves over there. How many weasels are there? He has at least 50 under his command. Hmm, we may be badly out numbered, but we've certainly got a chance from this vantage point. Can we get all the way up there? Yes, I think there's a way up from inside the cave. [Gavin] Hey, Shelly. Everything okay? Yep! [laughter] [all] Heave ho! Heave ho! Keep going guys. Almost! Good! The weasels will probably concentrate their attack on the main entrance. If we defend from above, then we will have a distinct strategic advantage. Very good. For some reason you're always happy, aren't ya? Yep! I try to be. After all, this is the first time I've ever been able to go on an adventure with everyone. And it's also the first time I've ever really been useful to anyone! So in a lot of ways, I guess I'm happier then ever! Hey! What can I do next? I'm all finished over there. [Rusty] We'll take turns keeping watch through the night. I want you to notify me at once if you see anything unusual. [mouse] Yes, sir! [grunts] You should try and get some rest, Gavin. It's gonna be a long night. - [Shelly] Gavin! Matthew! - Hmm? I brought you some water. Have some. Are you thirsty? This should make you feel better! Yeah, this is great! Thanks, Shelly! - Here's one for you, Gavin. - Great! Thank you! Sure. You're welcome. - Wow, you were thirsty. - Yeah! [laughter] [Matthew gasps] - What's the matter, Matthew? - No way. [Gavin] Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost! Over there! [gasps] [Gavin] The weasels. They're all there. We're gonna have take 'em down! All right, let's do this! Everyone! The weasels are here! There he is himself. Winston the white weasel. I've been looking everywhere for you, friends. You've found yourselves a lovely hiding place. I'm told one of you actually defeated a weasel of mine. Could it have been you, Gavin? [chuckles] You're surprisingly brave for such a little mouse aren't you? What's the sense in violently clashing with each other? You'll only lose in the end. So why not quit while you're still ahead? [grunts] Don't listen to anything Winston says to us. Hello, there. I have a feeling you and I have met somewhere before. Of course we have. But I'm determined to defeat you this time! So that's your plan? You expect to challenge us with mice half our size? Well, this is going to be glorious! [evil laugh] Wow-wee! Look at all that fresh food! Can we have some, too? [laughing] This is a night to be celebrated. It marks the time we stopped quarreling and decided to live together in peace. Now the celebration ceremony begins! - Look, they're dancing. Wow! - Yeah! That is so cool! Come, everyone! We invite you to join us. Let us sing and dance together. Let everyone be merry and fill our stomachs. Come. Drop your weapons and join us. Good. You have nothing to fear. We are your friends. What? Matthew! No, don't! Hey, wait! What's going on! [all chattering] [grunts] Stop, Shiloh! Don't be tricked by Winston! - No! - Let go! Father! No! Don't go! Stop! - Shiloh! - Yes. [chuckles] You must resist his spell! Don't fall for his trap! - [Bobo] Yay! - I think we're too late for that! - Join in! Come on! - Don't listen to him! Let's dance! Come on, Grayson, don't you wanna dance with us? Yeah! We'll carry you there! - No! - [Bobo] Come on! [Rusty] Matthew's under his spell! - This is bad. - Yeah, let's go! Take care of things here, Grayson! [Grayson] What? Help! Matthew! Snap out of it! No! Don't go! Yes. Come over and enjoy some delicious food! - You have to try to wake up! - No! Won't anyone listen? - [Clarence] Shelly. - Huh? - [Clarence] Chester. - Yeah? I want you to stay here. I'm counting on you. But, Father, wait! Where are you going? I must lead our people. It's what I must do. Don't go! It's far too dangerous! They need me. I am their leader after all. So do we! No matter what happens to us, I am counting on you to be brave. - Alright? - Yes, Father. Please be safe. You will always be in my heart. - Father. - Follow me, everyone! Wait! I'm coming, too! [Gavin] Don't listen to him! You gotta turn back! You've got to stop! You're falling for their trap! Shiloh! You're under his spell! We don't need you here anymore, Gavin. [Chester] Gavin! - Chester? - Help, you've got to save my father! [grunting] [Gavin] Clarence, no! - What are you doing? - It's okay! - Shelly? - It's no use. This is what he wants. - But why? - [Shelly] He wants to save them. - No! - Come back, Chester! I want my father! Father! What do you want from us? I'd like to welcome you to the feast! Eat up! Have as much as you'd like. The only reason I came here is to find out if you really intend to make peace! - What's that? - You know exactly what I mean! [grunting] [weasel] Where do ya think you're goin'? [all gasping] - Enough! - [weasel] Yes, sire. [Winston] Everyone stop! Look! It's Clarence! Friends and villagers, do not be fooled by these weasels! You must stay strong and fight to the very end! This is the last time we'll ever be fooled by you again, Winston! Even after I'm gone, you'll lose! [screams] [sobbing] His wishes were for us to stay strong. And that's what we're going to do. She's right. We gotta get ready! Everyone, get back to your positions! Now! You've all got to hurry! [all chattering] - Let's go, Shiloh. - I'm sorry! What can I do to make it up to you? Fight with us. - Hey, Gavin! - Huh? What is it, Rusty? The stone barrier we built's been breached! The weasels could get in there easily. You and me and Ace are gonna have to hold them off from the outside. Shiloh, I want you to lead the spear unit. - You got it! - Grayson! Are you ready up there?! We're good! All set to cover you! Um, oh! I need a spear. - Here! - Hmm? Be careful out there. - Alright, we're counting on you. - Of course! We've got to do what we can to help the boys! - Right. - Listen up! If a weasel tries to come in, push 'em back out with your spears! - [all] Yeah! - No! [laughter] It's time for you to see what weasels are really capable of. - Here they come! - Are you ready? [all] Yeah! Not until they're closer! Attack! Now! Let's get 'em! Who you lookin' at, ugly! [yelling] [grunting] Yes! [grunts] Oh, no! Even more are on the way! Do not give up! Keep throwing! There's no end to them! Get back! Go! Retreat! Now! Get everyone inside! They're attacking from above! Hurry! Get away! I'm not afraid of you! Gavin! Catch! [Grayson] We're not backing down! We must guard the entrance with our lives! - You okay? - Yeah! Gimme a hand. - You okay? - Oh, hey, Chester! Hey, Bobo, I'm fi... [both] Chester! [yelling] [Chester] No! Bobo! Help! Bobo's in trouble! Stop! - Gavin, watch out! - Bobo! Bobo's hurt bad! Stay with us, Bobo! Don't give up! Huh? - [growling] - Rusty! They need our help! Quick! Watch out! Stay back! [Winston] Beautiful. Just as I planned! [evil laughter] Rats! We've gotta think of something! - No! - Gavin! - That's it! - No! [grunts] [evil laughter] Huh? The sun is rising. Let's go! Time to go home. Huh? [Matthew] Gavin! What were you thinking? [snickering] See you again tonight. I don't like the sound of that. It's not over, is it? No way, they're only gone for now. But they plan on coming back again tonight once they've rested. Then it won't be long. When they come back here we'll be ready! The battle's not over but it's gonna be tough! Are you thirsty? What do you think? Will he be alright? He should be fine. He just needs some rest. Yeah? You really think so? Thank goodness, I'm so glad he's okay. [sighs] I'm sorry, guys. I hope I didn't let you down. I tried to do my best. I really tried. Uh, yeah. You did great. That makes me happy. Hey, you think that you and I could sail back home together? That would be really nice. I think I wanna go home. Sure. Of course we can. But you gotta relax and get some rest first, okay? Yeah. [Grayson] I do hope he'll recover. Good work! You all worked very hard today. But the fights not over yet. Now, get some rest. Gavin, it's important for you to get some rest. We have to block the opening. But you're gonna need your energy, Gavin. [grunts] Don't worry about me! I'm fine, alright? - [Rusty] Okay. - [gasps] Get some rest. [breathing heavily] Grayson, I'm afraid we're running out of time. This could be our last stand. But we've still got to do everything we can. So let's go out there and give 'em something to sing songs about. All right? I had a thought. What if we could get to Shelter Island? It's an ambitious plan, but it could work. Um, Gavin? Is everything okay? You seem so quiet. Huh? It's just I only wanted to see the ocean. When we got here I was so sure that we could defeat Winston. But now... I don't know anymore. It's alright. I don't know what'll happen. And that scares me a lot. I've never doubted myself before. - [Shelly] That's it. - [Gavin] What? Do you know what the yellow sago palm flower symbolizes? No. No one's ever told me. [sobs] It means hope. That flower means hope? Yes, hope. Don't you see, Gavin? It's a sign. Because of Winston we had lost all hope. But then all of you came along and gave us hope again. We can't give up, and this yellow sago palm will always remind us of that. - Shelly. - Thank you, Gavin. You're welcome, but I didn't really do anything. Oh, but you did. * Find your love here waiting for you * * Here across the ocean blue * When the moon is big and full and bright * * I'll be by your side * I can't wait for that day again * * We will be so happy then * On that night that we first met * * When another year has passed * * We will all be together again * * We will be so happy then [gasps] That's it! I've got it! - Huh? - I have a plan that might work! Is Grayson okay? So what's on your mind, Grayson? Don't keep us all waitin'. [clears throat] That song you were singing, the one about the sago flowers. It could be the missing puzzle piece. - Huh? - What? [Grayson] At least I hope so. Well, what do you think it could mean? Tell us, Shelly. How exactly does that song go? On the night, that we first met, when another year has passed, we will all be together again. They wait a year to see each other again. That's what I've been thinking about. That's a long time for two in love. Maybe it's because, he lived in a faraway land. And he couldn't travel here very often. That's right. Now, let us consider this possibility. That the love was between two mice. One who lived on these shores... [gasps] And one from Shelter Island! And these mice can only meet once a year. Because of the channel! It becomes safe once a year! Okay, but when does that take place? I know! Look to where the sago flowers bloom. On the night when the moon is full! Hey! Aren't they in bloom right now? - Tonight's the full moon! - Right! We're in luck. Let's just hope you're right about this, Grayson. Looks like somethin's gonna happen to that channel tonight. [howling] [evil laughter] Well, hello again. Ready to join our feast this evening? [all grunting] Huh? You guys, look! Out here! - The water. - [Rusty] What's going on? - Look at that! - [Gavin] The currents are picking up. Those waves can carry us all the way to Shelter Island. [Chester] That's a great idea. We can cross. Now we can cross the channel! But they're gonna spot us right away! We'll be out there in the open sea! [mouse] It's crazy! They'll catch us for sure! Rusty, we're gonna make this happen! - Wait, Gavin! - Wait, Gavin! Guys, I'm gonna buy you some time. - It'll give you a head start. - That's crazy. Don't worry, Matthew, I know how to outsmart those weasels. - Don't worry. I know it'll work! - Gavin! [chuckles] Who knew that our adventure would turn out like this. [chuckles] No kidding! You better come back. We still have a lot of sausages back home. Yeah. And cheese, too. Wait. Don't go! - That kid's got guts! - Be safe. [Winston chuckles] So, he's brave and foolish. We don't have much time. We need to leave right now. Then we had better get movin'! We have to cross while we can. - So get ready everybody! - Hurry, everyone. We can do this! Just believe in yourselves! - Alright, let's cross! - We got this! Yeah! Winston! I've been so looking forward to this meeting with you, Gavin. And I've been looking forward to taking you down a notch! [chuckles] Well, well. Aren't you full of spunk! Keep moving, everyone. Stick closely together now. Got a long swim ahead of us! But together we can do it! If everyone cooperates this could be our salvation. Do you think it'll work? It should at least give us the head start we were hoping for but make no mistake, they'll follow. There's no doubt about it, he'll be on our tails. We're just gonna have to swim along! We'll stop Winston and his weasels in the middle of the channel! - That sounds dangerous! - The tide will come back in, and weasels will perish in the rough waters. Let's hope. [Rusty] It's definitely worth the risk. Hey, Bobo! We're the last ones here. Okay, let's go! Wait, a minute. Where's Chester? Chester's fine. He's out there helping everyone get off the island. Oh, good. Then they'll be okay. Of course. Now how bout it? What do ya say? Let's get ya outta here, alright? I don't know, Ace. I think I'm gonna stay here. [groans] What are ya talkin' about? I'm not leaving you here, Bobo! It's all right. You go. I'm gonna stay behind. But thank you for everything. You know what? I feel like we've had a lot of fun, yeah? Of course. You're gonna be fine. I know in my heart... ...it'll all be fine. [Ace] Bobo? [sobbing] Farewell, buddy. [sobbing] This never would have happened if it wasn't for that white weasel! [Chester] Bobo? [Ace] Sorry, Chester. He didn't make it. Oh, no. No! [sobbing] Farewell, Bobo. Good luck, buddy. I'll never forget you. You fought well. He was a good friend. To us all. [Matthew] Goodbye, Bobo. [Chester] You were more than just a mouse. You were a hero. And you were also my friend. We'll never forget you. We're gonna fight in your name. [Rusty] That's right. I'm gonna help defeat the weasels, too! Do you really know what that means, Chester? Yes. Alright. Time to go! Here goes nothin'! Nice try! - Hurry! - Get him! [laughing] That was quite an impressive display, Gavin. Oh, yeah? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet! [yelling] What's the matter, Winston? Is the big, bad weasel too slow to catch a mouse? Catch me if you can! Can't ya go any faster! [Winston] Wait! Gavin's just a decoy. What are those mice up to? [chattering] Keep swimming! We're almost there, everyone! Get him! Hurry! Really? Is that the best you can do? [moaning] Come out wherever you are, little mice. Hmmm. [evil laughter] Looks like he's spotted us! Did you think you could deceive me? Well, you're wrong. Tear 'em apart! They're starting the attack. Is everybody ready to do this? - [all] Yeah! - Uh-huh. [group] Yeah! Shiloh! Why have you come back? It's our fight, too. Like Clarence said, "Don't give up!" Stay strong, everyone! This is our last stand! [all] Yeah! Let's go! [Winston] Now we gotcha! [Gavin] That's what you think! Uh-oh! Dead end! [yells] [grunts] Is everyone okay? Are the families alright? - We're okay here! - We're all fine! - We made it. - Yes, we did. [sighs] [mouse] Hey, where are the ship mice? - I don't see them anywhere, do you? - Huh? - Wait! Did you see them? - No, I didn't. Oh, no, did they make it? Where could they be? - Shelly! - Yes? Shiloh and Chester aren't here either. What? [gasps] No! Chester! [yelling and grunting] Everyone, swim to that log! Now! [coughs] [evil laughter] Thank you all for joining us. Really! I haven't had this much fun playing with my food since I was just a child. I only wish Gavin was here to see this. - Don't you? - You fiend! Where are the swells? Drat! We made it this far, but who knows what happened to the rest of the villagers. At least we know Shelly made it to the island. That's a relief. Indeed, it is. All right! That's enough for now! Aren't you going to fight? How disappointing. And you all smell so good! Wouldn't you agree, boys! Face it, you're surrounded! Oh, dear. This could be the end. [evil laughter] If Gavin was here he'd know what to do! We've had enough fun. Playtime is over! Look! I'm back! - [Rusty] There he is! - [Grayson] Fantastic, Gavin! Pop go the weasels! Yes! This will make the victory even sweeter. The victory is gonna be mine! No! Get away! - Let's do it! - You got it, Gavin! [yelling] [laughing] Sea birds! Dive formation! [grunting] [choking] [Winston] You dirty rat! That's it. You're goin' down! [yelling] Are you alright? - Yeah. - Good. Thanks a lot. The weasels are retreating, Gavin! It worked! We couldn't have done it without you. [cheering] Way to go, Gavin! I was so worried about you! [all yelling] The tide's coming back. The rough swells could swallow us whole! Everyone! Climb onto our backs. [grunting] [yelling] - [Shiloh] He's back! - [Rusty] Watch out. [mouse] I thought he was done for! [all gasping] How dare you, you arrogant little rodents! You really thought you could defeat the white weasel? - Winston! - Haven't you had enough? [laughing] This is it. Time to take him out for good. Here I come, Gavin! You're goin' down, Winston! [Winston] Get off of me! No! - You'll never defeat me! - Get him! [yelling] [grunts] Come here! - How could you! - I want a piece of him, too! Winston, we're gonna take you down! We're never gonna give up! [Grayson] Watch out! Behind us! Tidal wave! Lookout! [all yelling] This can't be the end! [yelling] [all gasping] Gotcha! Up we go! Thanks. Look! [cheering] Yes! - [laughing] - I'm exhausted. - You're back! - Yeah. - Chester! - Shelly! - So good to see you. - I'm so glad you're safe. Look... Winston's reign of terror has finally ended. It's over. I only wish that Father could be here. So what do ya say, Gavin? Hey. Where's Gavin? Is he here? Have you seen Gavin? Huh? Gavin! Where is he? Gavin! - Gavin! - Then that means he's underwater. No. Is he gone? - Gavin. - Oh, no. A sago flower bloom. - There's still hope! - Huh? Wait! You can't go out there, Shelly! - No! Stop! Let me go! - There's nothing you can do! The water's too rough! [whimpers] - Wait! - Where are you going? [Shelly] Theresa! I need a bird's eye view! - You got it! - Great! On three! One, two, three! [grunts] Let's go! Find him! [yelling] Here we go! Hold on tight! This is it. It isn't safe to go any deeper! No! [yelps] Oh, no! Shelly! Shelly... I'll never forget you. Farewell. [grunts] What happened? Where are we? [gasps] Shelly! Please! Open your eyes! Shelly! No, don't leave me! Shelly, please! No! [coughing] Hey, there. You saved me. Actually, it was the other way around. Not to mention it was really dangerous! I'm so glad to see you. It's so good to see you. Gavin. [Chester] Gavin! Shelly! - Chester. - [Chester] We knew you'd make it! - Hey, guys! - We really did it. - Everyone is safe now. - Yeah. They are for now. Let's hope it lasts. And that it always stays that way. - Shelly! - Oh, Chester! - We were worried about you, kid! - We missed you, buddy! [laughter] [grunts] [both chuckle] [Gavin] It sure is good to see everyone! It's finally over, at last. We defeated the evil weasels and peace was restored to Dream Island. [female mouse] Careful, children. Oh, Mom! - [giggling] - Thank you. [nervous chuckle] You're welcome. [Gavin] We fought hard on Shelter Island but it was all worth it. Hey, Gavin. What is it? Are you gonna go back to the city now? Well, yeah, I mean, I am a city mouse. I thought so. We'll sure miss you. I only hope our island stays peaceful for awhile. - Gavin... here. - Oh. Thanks! The red sago palm flower symbolizes love. Gavin, thank you. I was also gonna tell you that... - I... - Yes? Um, well, you see... - Well... - You can tell me. - Take care of yourself. - Yeah, you too. Bye! Can you take us all the way back home? We're ready to go! - It'll be my pleasure. - Time to go home! - All right! - Let's go! Yeah! [all laughing] [Shelly] Bye, Gavin! Be safe! - Well, Gavin. Not too shabby! - Huh? Looks like you got a girlfriend, huh? - No! It's not like that at all! - I think she likes you. - I'll get you for that, Matthew! - [Chester] Gavin! - Thank you! Bye! - Bye, Chester! Whoa! Whoo! [Shelly] Come back again, Gavin. [chuckles] We're goin' home! Wasn't it a wonderful adventure! - Yeah. - Yep! The best! But that's enough for now. I'm lookin' forward to goin' home! Yeah! I can't wait! Ready for another adventure? - [sighs] Not again, Gavin. - [laughter] [Grayson] Good show, gentleman. We did it! [Gavin] We're air bound and on our way home! [upbeat music]
