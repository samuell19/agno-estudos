Blessed Virgin Mary, I never dreamed that there could be so many riches! Emeralds, rubies, diamonds... Oh my God. Thief! The fate of all thieves in our valley is death. You monster! Witch! But you are only a woman. Only a woman, so you are mortal! I will give you a choice: either you marry me now, at once, or I'll drown you in your hellish lake. Stop the dog! Restrain him! I hate dogs!!!... It was only a joke... I... Don't come close... Stay away! Don't come close... See Arco, what should happen, inevitably happens. I am the one to marry you. When is our wedding? That liar Torres, who is gone now, wanted to marry me for my treasures. But you are not marrying me for that, are you? No. Are you marrying me for myself? For yourself. Nobody ever loved me. My people don't know how to love. But the affection and tenderness do exist. I learned this from my Mirror of the World. Of course you know what love is. When you kissed my hand, I felt bliss. You kissed not only my hand... but also my soul. My God, is that light? Holy Mary, it's light! I'm free! What's this? Gold! The Lady Who Dreams chose her husband! The Queen is getting married! Proceed, Priest. What are you waiting for? You poisoned the knife! Sneaky Priest! I expected nothing else from you! It's a pagan ceremony. It won't be legitimate for us. Don't procrastinate again! You can't change the Fate! I am the Priest of the Sun. My vows are holy. As the vowed priest I am to marry this woman, the Lady Who Dreams, to this stranger and intruder, instead of spilling his blood on our altar. My vows are holy. I cannot be false to them. I refuse to marry this woman to this man. In the name of the Sun God I refuse to perform this ceremony! Is that so? One more word and I will tell everyone, how many times you asked me to be your wife, to have absolute power over these people. Go on Priest, you have to perform the ceremony. No! Then shall you die, here and now. We are married, my husband. Priest, I invite you to the wedding feast. I'll come to your feast, and my people will come with me. I want to show you something. I inherited these treasures. They are passed from mother to daughter. Such is our tradition. What have you done?! I did it for you, for my own sake and for Henry, I haven't forgotten what a man's honour is about. Man's honour does not always satisfy a woman. You are unfair. A woman in love cannot be fair. Men honour their laws, which they invent for themselves. Don't women have any moral laws? Only moods. The law of the heart. It's unbelievable. Pal, you are now the richest man in the world. Stop it Henry! It all belongs to Acatava. Acatava, is it time to begin? The High Priest is in no hurry. Well, let's start without him. Will you keep your promise after? Of course. Time for a meal! Leoncia! What is it? Foul Priest! He had the courage after all. Go ahead! What a hot party! Even the roof is on fire. Yeah... Do you have a boat? We have only one way out - the lake. What!? This whirlpool. It is a certain death! Follow me. The trap door. Open it. Take the chest. Put it in the water. Listen carefully. The fifth pillar from sunrise and the thirty-third from its zenith. Some of you will come back here. The time will come and you will find these treasures. Run! Hold me tight, my husband. This lake will save us. Go on Francis, jump! We have no other choice! No, no, I do not want to. Stop! No! No! Henry, help me! Henry! Hey guys, this lady with me! Get lost! Henry! We are saved! Swim here. Here is a passage. Looks like there's light ahead. Maybe this is a way out. Stop! Don't move. We can't go there. I remembered. I saw this in the Mirror of the World. This is the last trap of goddess Chia. Her rage will burn us. What shall we do? I'll try to recall. The sacred deer... It's all in the sacred deer. If you walk past him, the God's mouths will spew out the fire that destroys everything. But then God rests for some time to restore the power. Some time you say... How much time does he take to restore his power? You said that you have run out of cartridges. The cartridges, yeah... ran out. Completely ran out. Henry, please don't miss. What?? Run! To the exit! This way! Careful! Speaking. Good morning, Mr Morgan. Good morning, Mr Bascom. I'm sorry... No need to apologise. I'm not expecting any good news. Mr Morgan, things are very bad. Very bad. We urgently need collateral. What about Tempico Petroleum? Can its shares go as collateral? Tempico Petroleum? I'm afraid not. What shall we do? Can you guarantee me any investments? How much do you need? One million dollars today before closing. And at least $20 million over the next two days. Otherwise despite my sympathies for you, I won't be able to help you. I appreciate your sympathy Mr Bascom, and try to turn to my friends for help. Parker, do have $20 million with you per any chance? $20 million with me? No, sir.... It's a pity. What's the weather like today? It was raining last night. Rain... Has Acatava got up yet? No, sir. Make me a bath Parker. The bath is ready, sir. Pardon me for saying sir... Ever since Mrs Acatava began living in our house, I have never seen her in such a depressed state as yesterday. I'm sorry, sir. Don't worry, Parker. It's not easy for her. She feels like a stranger here. Still no messages from Mr Henry? No, sir. But, if you order, I will send a telegram right away. No need Parker. Not yet... Please invite Mrs Acatava to breakfast. Yes sir. Father will be back soon. We need to do some preparations for the wedding. By the way, when does Henry return? He went to Bocas del Toro. He wants to invite that pilot. Did you invite Francis too? No. He is too far away to come to such insignificant occasion. And then, he is busy there. Listen, something is the matter with you lately. I have the impression that you are not happy to marry Henry. Why?? Henry and I are engaged, and he is nice, kind, cheerful. Yes, yes, I like him too. But, I'm sorry... Do you love him enough to marry him? Alesandro, I will marry him. Senor Alesandro, a chinaman wants to see you. Good morning, Acatava. Why aren't you eating? I'm not hungry. Is something wrong? Are you unwell? I don't belong here. And you have become so distant. Something is bothering you. You don't need me. What are you talking about my dear! I do need you. Then what forces you to leave me all the time and drives you away? Business. It is very important to me... Who is this Business? And why does he have so much power over you? Is that the name of your God that you all worship here? Like my people worship the Sun God? Yes, he is the great American God, and a very formidable god, when he punishes, he does it rapidly and mercilessly. Do you cause his discontent? Alas yes, even though I don't know how. I have to go to Wall Street. I'm listening. What's your business? Very important business. I make a lot of money. I sell secrets, I buy secrets. Very good business. Well, I listen. Though mind you: I don't buy secrets, and more so I don't sell them! You will want to buy this important secret. I learned in the colony that your sister senorita Leoncia is going to marry senor Henry Morgan. Senorita Leoncia is not your sister. She has other parents. Well, this is not a secret to us. Father adopted her a little girl. Strange that it is known outside of our family. Senorita Leoncia cannot marry senor Henry Morgan. Why is that? I'll tell you why. But this secret I sell. Very good secret. It costs a lot of money. It costs 1,000 pesos. Are you telling the truth? Yi Poon buys secrets, Yi Poon sells secrets. Yi Poon makes good money. Yi Poon has good evidence. Yi Poon will bring an old woman who was senorita Leoncia's nurse. You will pay 1,000 pesos, and then she will give the paper, which will tell you why senorita Leoncia cannot marry senor Henry Morgan. Please come in gentlemen! Good evening Parker. Good evening sir. Is Mrs Acatava already asleep? She is. Parker, be so kind, bring to my office... Tea? And coffee! Yes sir. You see Johnny, there in Panama, I met the most beautiful girl in the world. A gentle and noble creature. Excuse me, Francis, did the lady return your affection? She loves me as much as I love her. Would you like to see her? Of course. So why aren't you happy? Because I met her too late. And was forced to marry another. She is a wonderful woman, but unfortunately she will never win my heart. Mr Morgan! Wake up! Wake up, sir. Parker, you seem to be very excited. Has someone come for the property inventory? No sir. Nobody came. Parker, why didn't you knock? I'm sorry sir, but Mrs Acatava... I... I am afraid something happened... She disappeared this morning... Oh, God! You have an uncanny power over men. I am a woman too, also beautiful, and too want to be desired... But you subjugated Francis so that even in my arms he thinks about you! Are you also thinking of him in the arms of your husband? I have no husband. Fiance then. I have no fiance. What about Henry Morgan? Henry is my brother. We are brother and sister. It was discovered very recently. So you're still in love with Francis... But he is yours. No, you took him from me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... Acatava, it's all right. It's I who should be sorry. It's not your fault, nor the fault of Francis. I was unfair to you. I was unfair. I'm the one to blame, I could not win his love. Not you, but I must die. But first we need to save Francis. He is in trouble. Don't know about you, but I found this case very unpleasant. Yeah, I'm very sorry for the young Morgan. Yes, if I am not mistaken, the auction scheduled for Friday? Careful, damn it! Yes, on Friday. - The office is clear! Start in the living room. Aye! Gently. Gently. Careful! Not here. The sofa goes to the wall. The only thing I'm really sorry to lose is this park. I hope you understand that I did everything I could. Of course, Johnny! Who would have thought, that this beast Regan was so treacherous? Well, God bless him. Listen, Francis, just as a friend, let me offer you my house on Fifth Avenue. It's not as grand as this one of course, but it's at least something... Thanks Johnny. I am touched by your kindness, but I'm leaving for Frisco today, to my aunt. Excuse me. What happened Parker? Sorry sir, I packed your cases. Thank you Parker. Have you paid off the servants? Yes sir. I've done everything you ordered. They gathered in the lobby to say goodbye to you. Okay Parker, later. Have you found a new place? By the way, I put 100,000 in your name. You earned it. Parker? Mr Morgan. I wanted to ask you... Please take me with you. I will perish without you. Hey you! Put all the furniture back and get out! It's only 1:30 PM. We're people of no consequence. We do as we told. I'm telling you to get out of there. Leave them Johnny. Nothing will change before 5 PM. It's all over. And to me, perhaps it's time to change. What's with the living room? - Still some things left. Won't fit here. Nobody is allowed in, sir. How come? What happened? If I'm not mistaken, this is the mansion of Mr Morgan. Was. Now there is a property inventory for the auction, sir. How?! Where is Mr Morgan? Is he here? Yeah, but strangers are not allowed in, sir. What's your name? Teddy. Theodore, I hope this will compensate any troubles on duty. Thank you, sir. Go to hell! Mr Morgan is in office. Where are you taking this? Auction. What's your name? Harry. This is for all of you! Put all the furniture back! All of it, sir? All !! What happened? Francis, I bought a new hat. Henry... This is how I went bankrupt. So you lost everything... Yeah, but don't worry about it. I take it with humour. Money isn't everything. That's right. I better introduce you. This is Johnny, my friend and colleague. And this is sir Henry Morgan, my friends and relative. My pleasure Mr Morgan. Francis told me a lot about you. John, how could it happen? The attack was too powerful. We couldn't do anything; we simply didn't have enough funds. Are you sure there is nothing you can do? Henry, drop it please. Wait, Frankie. Johnny, is there anything you can do? Practically - no, sir. Though theoretically we still have time til 5 PM. So? What "so"? Omitting any details, we are lacking a mere trifle: 25 to 30 millions, sir. 28, to be precise. And that's all? Yeah, that's all. Phew, guys... I really thought something serious happened here. Francis, old pal, tell your friend not to play such jokes on me. You know that I have a faint heart. Johnny, this is enough, I hope. My God!! It's a billion in here, if not more. Francis, we'll mill them into dust. We will make mincemeat of them! Johnny, take the task at once! They all gossiping and mocking that he's broke. Johnny, we'll bring them to beggary! I want you to shake all the money out of them, all gold, including watches and teeth crowns! Excellent idea sir. Yeah! I like it too! I'm relying on you, Johnny. No worries. Gentlemen, according to the wishes of the new owner of the mansion, I have to ask you to vacate the premises. Yes, I don't want to wait. Gentlemen, the mansion belongs to Mr Morgan at least til 5 PM, So you'll have to wait. Francis, who is this dude? This is Mr Regan. Regan! Real Regan? Regan? I don't understand. You don't? I will explain. What?! Police! Mister! Good timing! What's your name? Bobby, sir. Look here Bobby... Kick this fat hog out of here. What?? Yes yes... We'll all be your witnesses if it comes to the trial. Henry, stop it! Mr Regan, you better leave. Yes Mr Regan, you better leave. I won't leave it at this. Stop. Now go. Bobby chase them out! Give him a good kick in the ass! Come on Bobby, you're a cop, and he is a thief! Listen, Henry, where is all this from? Have you found the old pirate's treasure? Not quite. Do you remember: "The fifth pillar from sunrise, and the thirty-third from its zenith"? Acatava! Do you know anything about her? Almost nothing. By the way, that's your share. Lieutenant Parsons and I landed three military airplanes right in the valley. What a scuffle it was! But that's not all the news. I've got a sister. Congratulations! Thanks. She was a little baby when she was kidnapped. And now she has grown into a beautiful woman. I'm very happy for you. I don't think you understand me. She's so beautiful that I would like you to marry her. I'm sorry, she may be a hundred times your sister and a thousand times a beauty, there is no woman whom I could marry. Nevertheless I think there is such a woman. I'm even willing make a bet, but I won't. It would be an unfair bet... Sis! Oh Lord! It is Leoncia... Well, yes. I'm telling you: my sister. Well go, go there! I should've bet at least a bottle of whiskey... Francis, old pal, I'm sorry to I distract you, but that's not all the news. I would like you to meet my wife. Darling. How? Very simple. One cannot escape his fate. I pulled the short straw, remember? You know, we're discussed it for a bit and decided to go look for the treasure of Sir Henry Morgan, Sr. When? Right now. I don't get it. A moment. Mr Parsons, please! The machine is ready, sir. Lieutenant Parsons.
