(WOMAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN GASPING) Reporting to you live from Lynwood County where a chilling scene has been discovered by police. The bodies of four family members were found inside early this morning in what police are describing to be a brutal homicide. We are collaborating with various law enforcement agencies on a possible connection to a previous set of murders in Oakwood Glen. (WHIMPERING) Dozens of miniature cameras were found inside the property, hidden in household objects such as smoke detectors, bookshelves and light fixtures. These killers are broadcasting their crimes as a live feed. Viewers apparently had no idea that what they were watching was happening in real life. I thought that it was fake. You just don't expect it to be real. I kind of feel sick to my stomach about it, but it's still entertaining. It appears that these victims were given the opportunities to defend themselves. (WOMAN GRUNTS) This played out like some kind of deadly game. The violence was kind of overwhelming... - Gruesome and... - Graphic. But it was okay in the moment because it was like a horror movie. I was rooting for them. I really didn't want them to die. The whereabouts of a fifth family member Marissa Vasquez are unknown tonight as authorities continue to search for the young woman missing since the horrifying incident. (SCREAMING) Our working theory is that this feed is being transmitted on a time delay. (WOMAN SCREAMS) FEMALE REPORTER: These killers are treating their broadcasts like a Hollywood horror movie, designed with one chilling purpose... ...to entertain. The question that remains is, will these killers strike again? And if so... MAN: (DISTORTED VOICE) How will they select their victims? - (MOUSE CLICKS) - (KEYBOARD CLACKING) JAMIE: I keep having this... This nightmare. It starts the same every night. There's, um... There's a storm outside. It's thunder and lightning and... I feel like I'm not alone. Like someone's watching me. MAN: Someone is watching you? Who's watching you? - JAMIE: Her. - MAN: Your mother? JAMIE: Well, at first I just... I feel her presence. But when the lightning flashes, I can see her. She's laying on the kitchen table. And she's got a shroud over her. MAN: So what's happening in Jamie's world? JAMIE: And I can see all these bugs, these spiders and cockroaches, and they're just... I'm fine. They're just eating away at her. MAN: Are you feeling scared? No. MAN: Those are very scary images. It's okay to be scared. It's perfectly normal to be scared. Yeah. MAN: Sometimes letting yourself be vulnerable makes you stronger. So do you think your father has dealt with his grief well? JAMIE: No. He came home one day with this new girlfriend. MAN: You must resent him for that. JAMIE: I don't resent him. I resent her. MAN: That's your stepmother, Olivia. How do you feel about Olivia? JAMIE: She's so different from my mom. I barely survived the first six months of their marriage. Now, I gotta be stuck with her on a whole ten-day vacation. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (KEYS JINGLING) (ALARM BEEPING) DJ: I told you, you should have peed at the airport. ADAM: I understand that. (SIGHS) It's not gonna be a problem. I'm gonna take care of it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Is there some maid you hired I'm unaware of? Coat on the rack, suitcase out of the way. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Steve. - JAMIE: Dad! - Let me explain. - JAMIE: You're shouting. - Let me explain. I'm gonna get you the money. You have my word. The deposit should go through any day now. It's not like I'm trying to fuck you over! I'm not trying to give you the runaround. Look, I'm gonna work something out here. (MICROWAVE BEEPS) OLIVIA: DJ, no food! It's almost 11:00. I know you can hear me. You've gotta be kidding me. Look, you don't have to threaten me. Expect a check tomorrow afternoon. Two days at most. Okay, fine. - Is it a healthy snack at least? - It's gluten-free. - Really? - Hey. What? - How do you eat this? - It's delicious. OLIVIA: Ugh! Something smells good. You guys have a snack without me? JAMIE: Uh, what happened to the wallpaper in my room? ADAM: Just feeling it out. We were gonna run it by you. Um, but you didn't. And you just went into my room? ADAM: Look, I really think you're really going to like it. OLIVIA: Look, I understand you're mad. Of course, we were gonna tell you first. We just thought that we'd find something that you liked. JAMIE: Funny, because I don't remember anybody ever having a problem with my wallpaper before. Right, DJ? - Right, DJ? - Yeah. Totally. I mean, actually, that wallpaper is kind of creepy. Okay. This is really uncool. Jamie... You told me you were gonna ask her before we tested the paint. ADAM: I was going to, and then I remembered how she reacted when I asked if I could throw out her Harry Styles posters. OLIVIA: This is not helping here. I mean, how'd she even see it? (CREAKING) (COMPUTER CHIMING) (CREAKING) (PHONE BEEPS) Hey, Josh, it's me. I've left you like a thousand messages so just call me back when you get this. (PHONE BEEPS) DJ! DJ! DJ! What? My charger, why did you take it? I don't know what you're talking about. I have my own charger. - JAMIE: I don't believe you. - Fine. JAMIE: Wait! So, you're not screwing with me? No. I'm being totally normal. You should try it sometime. JAMIE: Wait, Deej, wait. - I'm sorry. - Whatever. Hey. Come on. It's just you and me, right? DJ: Sure. OLIVIA: DJ, take out the trash! (WATER FLOWING) (RUSTLING) - OLIVIA: Oh, my, God! Sorry. I'm sorry. - JAMIE: Hey! Get out! - OLIVIA: Sorry. - JAMIE: Get out of here! (PIANO KEY PLAYS) (DOOR OPENS) (TWIG SNAPS) Cool. You're gonna die! Matt! - I'm sorry, dude. - You definitely frightened... MATT: Uh, so, that was too easy. You were just like a sitting duck, man. - How you doing? - DJ: I'm all right. You survive Florida, my man? Yeah. It was pretty boring. Hot as hell. I went to the beach, went to dinner. I'd rather be playing Xbox, but... Oh. It's on already? - Hell, yeah. - Okay, I'm getting my revenge. - DJ: Let's do this. - MATT: No, you can't push it like that. That is against the rules. You can't do that, no! You can't score. DJ, I'm gonna kick your... - MATT: Hey, bro. - You staying a while? I don't... Um... Yeah, this... It's kind of a long story. Matt? It's 11:30 at night. Wait, why didn't you just call us at least? I was going to call, but Sheryl kind of accidentally deliberately threw my cell phone in the toilet. But he's gonna be out of here in three days. Tops. Three days tops. Hi, Liv. How are you? I'm good, thanks. Thanks for asking. - OLIVIA: How you doing? - Oh, my God. No way. You're too hot for this guy. This is stupid. This just doesn't even work. - We got some pizza in the freezer. - The two of you. - Go get some food. - MATT: Oh. Okay. I'll set you up in the room. Mmm. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - (MUSIC PLAYING FROM SPEAKER) JAMIE: Coming! Yeah. (KNOCKING CONTINUES) - Hey, Killer. Hi. - Oh. Hey, there. Now's not actually a good time to talk. MATT: No, no, no. No, no. You're not getting off that easy. You gotta give me something. Come on, it's me. Catch me up. I wanna know about your life. Go. Um... Olivia's trying to destroy my life. Okay, first of all, refined sugars, that's what's destroying your life. Second of all, Olivia is not scary at all. If anything, she's terrified of you. Why would she be afraid of me? 'Cause you're a teenage girl. Teenage girls are terrifying. One look from a teenage girl will send most men off... You just did it. You did the teenage girl look. I'm terrified right now. You see? I just feel like... Like I don't have a say in anything, you know? And it stresses me out. MATT: It's good not to have a say in things. You just gotta chill. Believe me, I know. That's why I self-medicate. Really? It's for my glaucoma. You know that. All right, good talk, son. You gotta get out of this funk. Come here. JAMIE: Okay. MATT: Do your homework and eat more vegetables. And, uh, drink more water and exercise. That's what your Uncle Matt says. (SOFTLY) It's really good. It's really good. (DOOR SHUTS) He's my brother. What am I supposed to do? OLIVIA: You tuck him in. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (COMPUTER CHIMES) ADAM: Hey, guys. Look at the camera. (CHILDREN GIGGLING) - Look up at the camera and smile. - JAMIE: What the... ADAM: What do you think? Is that a butterfly? - YOUNG JAMIE: A butterfly! - ADAM: A butterfly? Did Mommy make a big butterfly, too? Great job too, Mommy. (CREAKING) (GASPS) (PUNK ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (COMPUTER CHIMING) Hey, I got your texts. All 20,000 of them. I was worried that on your way home from the airport you got trapped under a burning car. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, go for it. Do you see us staying together? I mean, like, past senior year. Yeah. I mean, I think so. Do you? Yeah. Babe, what's going on? Nothing. I don't want to talk about it. Talk about what? Babe, what's going on? Do you think even when people die they could still judge you for your mistakes? Baby, are you talking about your mom? It's been six years. All right? What would she judge you for? I gotta go. Come on, I miss you, and you're freaking me out. Talk to me. Like, did I do something? Did I screw up? Say something wrong? No. No, it's not you. I just... - Yeah, I gotta go. - Jame. (COMPUTER CHIMES) Does she know I'm 35 grand deep? No, I'd be a dead man. - Thirty five grand? - Look, don't... Jesus, even the rich are poor. Here, man, it sounds like you need this more than I do. Oh. Oh, God, it's like we're back in senior year. Where'd you get this shit anyway? Same guy we got it from in senior year. - No. - No, I'm not kidding, man. - Dirk, he's a lifer. - No. All right, I'm going to arrive around the corner. Watch out. There's a guy right there. (SCREECHING OVER HEADPHONES) What the hell? Okay, sorry, I'm back, guys. Oh, come on. That's bull crap. Jame? Yeah? Just wanted to see if you're okay. Yeah, I'm okay. Listen, I... We shouldn't have gone in your room without your permission. It was stupid of me. I know this transition's been rough. And the last thing you need is someone invading your privacy. All right. Good night. JAMIE: Night, Dad. Hey. Five more minutes, then the game goes off and the teeth get brushed. - DJ: Can it be ten? - ADAM: Five. Shit. Maybe I've been trying to change too much. I'm just afraid I'm never gonna connect with her. Stop it. You're just feeling each other out. Besides, you got lucky. You missed the zombie years. The piss, the shit, the puke. You took a shortcut to the best parts of motherhood. No. (BIG CAT YOWLING) What the fuck? (ANIMAL LOWING) (ANIMAL SOUNDS CONTINUE) What the fuck? Jesus! (DRONE WHIRRING) What? DJ? (BLADE SLASHING) (STATIC OVER SPEAKERS) - MAN: (DISTORTED VOICE) It's started. - (BEEP) (DOOR OPENING) (URINATING) Two to three minutes. Yeah, okay. (CAMERA WHIRRING) I'm in here!

Where are the phones? We gotta go downstairs, and we have to help him! There's somebody downstairs. Our only priority right now is to get out of this house. - Do you understand? - JAMIE: How are we gonna do that? Check the windows. See if we can get out through that side. We can't jump. It's way too high. (DRONE WHIRRING) - What is that? What was that? - Back away. Back, back, back. We have to get out of here. We have to get out of here. Help! Help us! Help! Help us! Somebody help! - What is it? - Nothing, nothing. - What? What is it? - Get back, get back, get back! (CLACKING) - Oh, my God. - JAMIE: What's that? What is that? What is happening? You don't understand. It's ridiculous. It's like... Jamie? Jamie, what is this? She treats me like a child, but yet she's closer to my age than to my dad's. I don't know. I don't know. - She's a total gold digger. - They were watching me... And the grossest part is, I think my little brother has a crush on her. - What the hell is this? - I don't know. I don't know. You know, my dad acts like I'm the one with the problem. But really, he's the one in total denial. What is this? He's the one that's responsible for all this. Is this a prank between you and your friends? - This isn't funny, Jamie! - No, I don't know how they got these! - How'd it get on the screen? - I don't know. He's filming me! Sometimes... Sometimes, I wish it was him. Oh! Oh, no! - It's okay. - Oh, my God. No! Turn it off. - It's okay. It's okay. - Turn it off! Turn it off! - Who's doing this? - JAMIE: I don't know! - DJ: Jamie, I'm scared. - Okay. Okay, look... All right. All right, we just stay calm. We're gonna get out of this house. Okay?

We're gonna walk out of that door right now. Okay? - Just stay together. - DJ: Are you sure? Everyone's gonna be fine, I promise. Just stay together, okay? You know what, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Come on. Come on. Help me. - Stay together. - Yeah. OLIVIA: (WHISPERING) Nobody's here. It's just us. - What do we do? - I don't know. Come on, stay together.

To cut you open and see what's inside you. We've been watching you a long time. We know your darkest thoughts, Jamie. We see the anger you hold back. For your mother. Your father. You used that to stay alive. And now we all want to see how far that will take you. There's a shock value to that that's endlessly entertaining. - I couldn't help it. - I had to know how it ended. Use this gift, Jamie. The only way you're going to survive is if you become the darkness inside you. Please, whoever's watching this, please help us! We live at 2-1... (STATIC) ...lane. Remember when you asked me if we were gonna die? - And I said I didn't know. - Yeah. I do know. The only other person who's gonna die here tonight... is him. - Listen to me. - No, Jamie. - DJ, you have to trust me. - No. It's okay. So this is what we're gonna do.
