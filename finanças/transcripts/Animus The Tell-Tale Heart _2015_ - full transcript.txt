You cannot protect him! I am doing nothing of the sort. I have no idea where my son is. To be suspected of this vile crime- my son is no murderer! Liar! He killed her, Nelson! My daughter! Where is he? You know! Impossible. I haven't seen him in weeks. [Laughs] Why do you bother Nelson? There's no way out of this. When I find him, he's a dead man. Who do you think you are?!

It's silly, I know. Part of me thinks she may step through our door at any moment as if... ...it's all a bad dream. Oh, hello Edgar. Have a seat. What is happening here? You're very deep in your own head. You know, I was thinking about what you had said, which means, you were thinking about what you had said. What I said? About not letting me decide when it's over. As in the young man who killed your daughter. Not me per-se, I'm only a representation. Yes, I understand! What of it?! Well, who's to decide? You're just a sad, angry father with no part in the events that took place... save being the sole witness to my personal “execution. ” And me? I'm just a dead guy. A swinging corpse. It's all out of our hands, really. It's not that easy to live with it My wife and I wake up every morning without our daughter. always an empty place at the table...

Edgar wait a second- Why is this door locked? Why, hello Edgar. What are you doing in my office? Edgar! Pleasure to have you back! Uh, Mister Nelson here, see, we were- we were just using your office to sign a few things. I just closed the mortgage on my estate. Just a week shy of my seventy-first birthday. Can you believe it? Yes uh, pretty old... By the way, Edgar. You'll be happy to know that I'm thinking of selling it all. Too many bad memories, as it were. That's a shame. Yes, it is a shame. My son always wanted to inherit my land. But, hmm... oh well. Thank you for your business Mister Nelson. I want you to know your money is always good here. I appreciate that. Oh, Edgar, by the way... I never told you how sorry I am for your loss. Now that I understand what that feels like. Perhaps I'll be conducting further business with the bank.

This is her blood. You strangled her, drove to your father's barn, dragged her lifeless body in here and- Then you took her to pieces. Why on earth would you do that? With that especially. That looks like a pretty difficult task for just a knife. You sure that's it? There has to be plenty of more useful equipment in this old barn. Oh, I'm sure... These are your thoughts, remember? This is all in your head. If you wanted to find a knife- you found a knife! Hell, you should have discovered a chainsaw. Messy? Sure, but- far more effective. That wasn't very nice. You were an idiot, a complete moron. You sure about that? And an asshole! Unfortunately- and I hesitate to give the man any credit you didn't inherit a single trait from your father. I can't speak to that. Although an asshole himself, Nelson has always been a gentleman. Well, now that's true. Quite a successful businessman as well.

Say what you will, though it seems like we've gone pretty far already.. what's a little more crazy gonna hurt? Yeah? If you're so smart, what would you do with him?! Keep it clean. And you should probably forget what I said about the chainsaw. The fun part's about notgetting caught. The fun part? Go to hell! This isn't fun, it's... It's what, Edgar? It's necessary. If you thought there was no going back before, Edgar, Well then... I think you know that, as well as I do. [Chopping/heavy breathing] [Heavy breathing/struggling] [Heavy breathing] [Clock strikes] [Startled] [Knock on the door] Who, who is it? State Police. Please open the door, sir. [Knock on the door] A-absolutely, just one moment officer! Let's keep this quick I- [sneeze] Say no more. Hello Officers, how can I help you? Are you Mister Nelson, sir? Me? No. I, I- I'm a good friend of his. Well, I was called out here by him, in fact... although he's no longer here I'm afraid. I see. And, who may you be, sir? Me? My name is Edgar. Well, Edgar, I assume that's your vehicle out there in the ditch. Yeah, that's right, it's a bit slippery out. Sir, I'm Officer Mellish, this is my partner, Officer Starkwell. We have two questions: why are you here, and where is Mister Nelson? I was called out here, Officer, as I've said. But when I got here, Nelson no longer was. I'm not sure where he's gone. And why were you called out here? From the way that Nelson spoke to me over the phone, I felt he was in danger. Is that so? Well, It's not like him Officer to, to sound so fearful over the phone. Being that I've watched over him over the years I felt it necessary to come right out. Unfortunately Nelson seems to have gone off by himself. Or not by himself. Frankly Officers, he's not been in his right mind since his son passed away a short time ago. Well, you don't think he's in trouble do you? Is that why you're here? Mind if we come in, Edgar? No... no, no not at all. I don't mind telling you Edgar that we were called out for the exact same reason. Oh, is that so? Can I ask by whom? Anonymous. Although, not surprisingly, they shared your concerns. Does Mr. Nelson drive? No, he has a service, sir. Well, we'll have to call to see if he was in fact picked up. Oh dear, you don't think he walked off by himself, do you? Is that impossible? We can't afford to rule anything out now, can we Edgar? No, no we certainly can't, Officer. [Piano key strikes] And how exactly do you know Mr. Nelson, Edgar? Well, I've served him for years at the bank in town- we've become quite close! I've looked in on him here and there as he's gotten on in years- his needs- well, he needs some help some- times and, what with his son... well, I don't need to tell you his, well, his mind wanders a bit and, so if he's taken to up and walking off by himself... it seems more possible the more I think about it. Uh huh. You wouldn't mind if we took a look around would you- That sounds like a bad cold, Officer? Ah, it's nothing, really. Let me make you gentlemen a hot pot of tea while you look around! That won't be necessar- [sneeze] Ah, no no no, it's no problem at all. There's definitely something going on here. You don't think he's going to try and run, do you? Nah, he thinks his explanations are working for him. Let's see if we can get him to crack. I'll look upstairs. [Whistling] JONATHAN VO: They know what you did. [Screams] STARKWELL VO: Everything all right in there? Uh, uh everything's fine Officer, your tea will be ready shortly. They're toying with you. They're not idiots. You made too many mistakes. Shut up! "He called me, we're such good friends!" What bullshit. You don't know anything. What can they possibly do, huh? Nelson's nowhere to be found, there's no sign of a struggle, no sign of any wrongdoing at all, he's simply gone! They're Officers, Edgar, they'll search the house. They've already seen the broken frame to the front door. Christ, Edgar, they'll search the barn! And find what? There's nothing they can find there I can't simply deny! Nothing? Just wait a week. I'm sure the house will be rather pungent. Try denying that. Doesn't matter! As soon as they're satisfied here tonight, I'm leaving. Edgar, what about Caroline back there in the trunk? CAROLINE OC: Heeeeeelp! Get me out of here! You don't just shove someone in a trunk and think they're going to keep their mouth shut. You think she's going to lie for you? CAROLINE OC: Heeeeeelp! I'm in a trunk! It doesn't matter! They'll never find me! By morning I'll be gone! JONATHAN VO: [Sigh] Whatever you say, Edgar.. [Teapot whistling] Your tea, Officer. Come here and take a close look at this, Edgar. What do you make of it? Huh. It looks as if the wood has broken off around the latch. Worn out, maybe. Over time, do you think? No, Edgar, I don't think that at all. Ah, thank you. I could use this- late nights, you know? [Sips] Mmm, it's good. [Sips] Ah... Can I ask what you're looking for, exactly? Oh, anything suspicious, Edgar. Anything that might show us why an old man- seventies? Eighties? Uh, seventy-one this week, in fact. Why such a man of his age might up and disappear late at night- early in the morning, as it were. It's a bit strange, I'd say. Speaking of, what did he say? What did he say? On the phone. He called you, remember? [Laughs] Oh, yes! Of course... I'm, I'm trying to recall, there was nothing much to it, really- it was extremely brief. Fear, mostly, in his voice. Asked me my name a few times, asked if I was alright? He asked if youwere alright? Yes! Strange, I thought because I'm, I'm just fine. Just, completely fine. Are we sure of that, Edgar? JONATHAN VO: Look out Edgar! All he's thinking about is clubbing you across the back of the knee and placing his foot over your throat! Well! I, I should go get Officer, uh... Mellish. Mellishhis, his hot tea. So. Who do you think called them, Edgar? [Quietly] No one! Stop bothering me! Let's see, your boss Mr. Singer, he was spot on, wasn't he? What's the word he used... SINGER: It won't be anything unsavory... Oh yeah, unsavory, that's certainly a fine way of putting it. He's an idiot. Totally inept! You know, Edgar, you haven't quite been yourself lately. Mr. Singer's noticed, Caroline's noticed... Impossible... And Lenore, well, she's defitely noticed. How dare you! I'm not some maniac loose in the night, some deranged psychotic waiting to strike at anyone near him! My wife, scared to be near me... preposterous! Of course, and yet, here we are, Edgar [Knocks on door] Oh. Come on in Edgar. You don't think the old man would mind if I sit on the bed, do you? I brought you some tea, Officer. Yes, yes that's right... Mm, good. Just what I needed. Glad I can be of help. We appreciate it Edgar, we really do. Have to be quite a view out here in the daytime. Nothing but fields and trees, for miles it seemed on our drive out here. Yep, all out here alone. Not a soul around. ‘Course, can't see much of that at this time of the morning. Shame, really... hardly believe we could find a witness to the crime. What crime would that be, Officer? Just speculating Edgar, that's all. You see I can't help but think of the worst possible thing that could happen to poor old Mr. Nelson. Then I work backwards. Because that helps, Edgar. Helps me get in the correct state of mind. Helps me think like they do. The supposed criminal or criminals, that is. I see. Then again, maybe the poor old bastard just wandered off. Who knows, anyway. Well I, I I guess I wouldn't put it past him. Has it ever occurred to you to just shut up? [Quietly] Has it ever occurred to you?! Of course I've considered it, it's just that it doesn't seem so likely. Why don't you join us downstairs before we go, Edgar? Just a few more questions. I scoured it, I got nothing down here. What about upstairs? No apparent signs of a struggle, the old man's bed looks recently slept in, the closet's a mess... other than that... [Loud sigh] Edgar, are you certain that he called you from here? Well, [clears throat] no, I suppose I'm not. Uh, I prefer to stand, thanks. Can I ask you Officers a question? Of course Edgar. Am I suspected of something? [Laughs] Absolutely, Edgar. Did you think otherwise? [Laughs] Can I ask what you base that on? You can simply ask us, Edgar. You don't have to ask if you can ask us. It is a bit peculiar, wouldn't you say, Edgar? That you're the only one here. You are the only one here, in a house that isn't yours. You've come a long way Edgar. [Laughs] Since you journeyed into a barn. I uh... [clears throat] I think I'd like to have a lawyer present if uh, you Officers are going to ask any more questions. [Laughs] JONATHAN VO: A helpless father. Now Edgar, you're really not in a position to request something like that. JONATHAN VO: ...without a daughter. Edgar, we could take you in on this alone if we so wished. Is that what both of you want? Is that where this has been going? And you somehow managed, to take your part in all this madness. As if there was no other way, really. Honestly? No, Edgar. We don't take any pleasure in simply arresting suspects. Because then you have to witness the denials, the lies and all that... Paperwork. Oh God, yes! The bloody paperwork. And everyone played their role so perfectly. A carefully orchestrated three-act play. [Low heartbeat] And you know, Edgar, I can't wait to see how it all ends. [Steady heartbeat] [Quietly] Stop talking to me! I'm sorry? Edgar? Edgar, now is not the time to go silent. We know something about you. We know just why you might be here this evening. Revenge is a tricky thing, Edgar. No one keeps their hands clean for too long. What would your daughter say about all this? [Screams] Hey, easy Edgar. Edgar... Ah... that sound again... pounding! Hammering away! Tearing my brain apart! Edgar, restrain yourself! Edgar, calm yourself! You're just making this situation much worse! Don't you hear it?! That hideous sound?! Pounding! Thumping the thoughts from my brain! I can't take it! [Laughs/cries] No! He's losing his mind! Calm yourself Edgar! Stop what you're doing right now! You're- you're villains! Here! Here! I'll tear the boards away! I admit it! I admit everything! Just make it stop! Please make it stop! Make what stop?! [Loud heartbeat] Oh my God... Jesus! He's hacked him to pieces! [Laughs/cries] No! You hear it! That sound! It's the beating of his hideous heart! [Laughs/cries] [Steady heartbeat] [Heartbeat]
