It affects countless human beings all over the world. And like some of you, I've experienced it first hand. With my own mother. As you all know, it was in 1901 that Alois Alzheimer Observed that Mr. Deter Frankfurt Asylum in Germany. He was 51 years old and exhibited, among other things, Loss of short-term memory.

Thank you. Can I have another one? # Why should I feel discouraged # Why should the shadows come # When Jesus is a portion # My constant friend is he # His eye is on the sparrow # And I know he watches me Sweetheart? All-right, It was just a dream. Just a dream. # Every morning the memories stray # Across the sea where flying fishes play # And as the night is falling # I find that I'm recalling # That blissful all enthralling day # I found my love in Avalon # beside the bay # I left my love in Avalon # And sailed away # I dream of him in Avalon # From dusk till dawn # So I think I'll travel on # to Avalon I think that is about it for the day, dear. How are you? Good and you? Well, don't we look comfortable. What have you been doing? I got a sandwich from the grocery, I went to the Frenchman Street, listened to some great music. And then I took a little "siesta". "Siesta"? All right. I'm going to change and get dinner going. "Siesta". Hey, Queeny. Hey sugar.

When you were getting started It was like listening to Sam Houser, himself. Yeah, lots of influences along the way, I suppose. It was very good. She just take this and give it to the first person she sees. She don't know money. And barely knows she sang a song. I see to it that she don't starve to death not knowing that. Cruz. Stomp Play She's goes by "Una Vida". ""Una Vida"". I saw the most interesting performance today. Where, somewhere on the Frenchman? Nope, the old diner where I used to go with Mama. An old man and a woman. The woman ... was wonderful. But something was off. She loose her place in the song and then find it again, I don't know I've never seen anything like it.

Tap dance in the streets for money. Right up there in Storyville. He picked up the pennies and put them in his mouth To keep the big kids from getting to them. So they called him "Satchel Mouth".

Just another dream. WC - Good Morning. - Good Morning. You want to tell me about these dreams? Since Mama ... Every night, or when I shut my eyes I dream. And each time I see myself I'm 6 or 7 years old in the field behind my mother's house . In each dream, there is a butterfly. And I chase after it but never catch it. It's all linked.... somehow. What do you mean linked? To my mother. Do you like this book? "Sam and the Firefly". "The moon was up and Sam came out." "Now it's time for fun, he said." "Who, said Sam." who... ""Who,?" "Who wants to play?" "But no one said anything." "Then Sam went about, the fox was asleep." "And the Jay was asleep." "The dog was asleep." "And the hog was asleep." "The sheep was asleep." "And so was the cow." Have we met? Yes.., Queeny. We are friends. Queeny, I am going to go and get the mail. You want your headphones? Ok, great, I'll put the tube on. # Oh, it's only a paper moon # Sailing over a card board sea # But it wouldn't be make-believe # If you believe in me # Yes, it's just a canvas sky # Hanging over a cotton tree # But it wouldn't be make-believe # If you believe in me # Without your love # It's a party without grace # Without your love # It's a melody played # With a coin in a video arcade # It's a Barnum and Bailey world # just as hollow as it can be # But it wouldn't be make-believe # If you believe in me # The light paper moon # Shines over a cardboard sea # It will always be real, my love, # as long as you care for me Hey, Queeny, hey It's okay, girl. It's okay. Oh, It's all right...It's all right old babe, is out of tune. We'll take it to Kenny. He'll fix it. It's all right. Louisiana Music Factory, this is Kenny. Hi, Kenny. This is Dr. Cruz. I met you with "Una Vida"... Yeah, I remember... Doctor, ? What's, up Doctor? Listen, have you seen "Una Vida" or Stomplay? Nooo Man, I haven't seen them in a while. What's up? Well, I I haven't seen them either and It's been a few days. I am sure they are ok, is just that. Well, What do you know about "Una Vida"? What's her story? Who is she? You know, I asked.

And she's ain't doing so good, doctor. She just sits there, stares. She doesn't even hum no more. Do you think Jessica could take care of her? Jessie is a junkie. Does "Una Vida" knows you're leaving? No. I did not tell her or Jessica. It's a damn shame a woman like Queeny Had to share her life with likes of me. What have you done for her has been great.

What do you intend to do with "Una Vida"? And why should I tell you? Because I want to help her and because I just paid you a lot of money She needs someone to care for her. Time is up. Stompleg is leaving and she has no one. - Hi, Doc. - Stompleg. Queeny, you remember the doctor? Are these yours?.... Yeah In Angola you got to find something to occupy your time, while doing your time The hardest thing is the sameness of everything. I can still remember what I had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day. Doctor, I done some things I'm not so proud of But some good things you might not believe. I learned my music. Because of that, I met her. Would you mind if "Una Vida" and I went for a walk? No. I think she like that. # There is a place # Called Lonesome Valley # You have to go there # by yourself # Aint nobody else # Gone go there for you # You got to go that valley by youeself # My mother walked # to Lonesome Valley # She had to walk that lonesome valley for herself # Aint nobody else # Will walk it for her # She got to walk that lonesome valley by herself # We all have to walk that lonesome valley # We have to walk that lonesome valley by ourselves # Aint nobody else, will walk it for us # We have to walk that lonesome valley by ourselves Sweetheart, it's temporary. It is just a few days. But why would you bring her here without talking to me first? I know, I know, I'm sorry. I dont feel right about... I'm sorry. Alvaro, this is a big deal. You can't just expect... Angela, when my mother needed me, I wasn't there. Shh... please. It's the right thing. I know it. Please. I know it. How you find me? They found my business card on you. What happened? I just got little stupid, that's all. Where is she? She is in my house for now. But... I'll should take you home and then we'll go see her. We need to talk. I'm going to get change. - Want some water or something? - Sure - Thank you. - I have to smoke a cigarette. - Want to talk outside? - Sure My mother died when I was born. Queeny was my mother until I was 12. And then she went away again. For her music. I guess she figured she... she gave me all she could. And then she came back? I was 18. I walking home one night and I hear her voice. That voice. We talked for hours. Any anger I had, just went away. She moved in with me and things were good. My art was selling and ... We were happy. Then she began to forget things. Little things at first. We would supposed to meet some place and she wouldn't show up. She forget her way home and I had to go looking for her. And when was it? When did it start? About 10 years ago. Then one day she got angry. She broke all my pieces. I tried to stop her, but she knocked me down. Broke every single one except the butterflies. Why butterflies? It's all she talks about. Her music, her butterfly, her Firefly,...she loves that damn book. Can I show you something? Sure. This is one of Queeny drawings. It's a club in New York called Village Gate. She talks about it all the time. How she played there. It opened in 1958. How come she remembers a club that opened in 1958, But do not me? My mother had Alzheimer's. And that is what "Una Vida" has. My mother wasn't aggressive. not everybody is But at times she didn't know who I was. That broke my heart. This is very good. Yeah. She drew a lot. She always put herself drawings. When he started forgeting things, the drawings changed. Things got all, things just changed up in her mind. Oh yeah. And everywhere she went, she always wrote my grandma. Paris. I think it's time to go see "Una Vida". and maybe you could stay with us for a while. She should like that. Why are you doing this? Because I can. Sweetheart. I thought that maybe we could have diner in. Angela, this Jessica. Where is she at? She's taking a nap. But she will be down for dinner. I'm Angela. Jessica.
