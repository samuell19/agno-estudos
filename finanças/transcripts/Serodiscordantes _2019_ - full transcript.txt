Why don't you kiss me? - Wait until I brush my teeth. - No. Let me smell your breath. I love that smell. Degenerate! I love you. We could start getting up and unpacking. OK. Is my name Miguel Hernando? OK, yes. Is my name Carmen Sevilla? Look, it works. It's turning anti-clockwise. That means no. Is his name Evaristo and is he a great painter? It's turning clockwise. - That means yes. - So, I'm famous. The dreams I've been having since we got here... Do they mean there's a spirit? Eva, look! I knew it. I have been feeling it since we got here. Ask about us. Were we right leaving Madrid? That's a yes, right? See? Everything is going to be OK. Spirit, I haven't had a shower in two days. He can't call you filthy otherwise he would. Miguel, please help me. - Which one is this one? - The guy's paint. Hold it. Where are you going to put it up? I was thinking here. A little bit higher. A bit higher. A bit more. - More. More. - I can't reach. - Here. - There then. OK. - What would you like me to play? - Whatever you want. - Did you bring that from Madrid? - It's to toast. To us. To this city bringing a lot of opportunities. And all the stupid things people say when they toast. You know I can save you. Only I can save you. The first thing I see is your face... You're purple, almost blue. Your eyes are yours. But they are empty. Like if they had exploded. Like when you are at the last stage of cancer. Your head is almost touching the floor. Your hands and feet are tied up. Your body is half-naked. Then someone comes in and pulls the rope. And your body lifts. You move from side to side. Like a pendulum. I think it was me who killed you. But I'm not sure. What do you think that means? Maybe you regret having come here with me. No. I mean, maybe it's a bit too soon. - What about if we ask the pendulum? - Ask what? How long we're going to be together. Or even better. YES - NO - GOODBYE Is there anyone else here with us? Are you moving it? YES What's your name? n t h e r Gunther. I'm Evaristo. Gunther is a German name, of course. Are you good? YES When did you die? 2107. Can you predict the future? YES How long are we going to be together? No answer. HIV. Why HIV? What does that mean? I don't know. He's giving misleading answers. How many more years are Eva and me going to be together? The Wi-Fi isn't working. Try asking something. Why can't I swallow your semen? There's no one else in this room but you and me. I have to ask you something. I was very scared. I thought you were going to leave me. I don't want anything to happen to you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it before. How long have you had it for? Since before I met you. I'm undetectable, Evaristo. It's impossible for me to infect you. Where's the water? You have to put more saliva. Where's the water? SERODISCORDANTS
