Eddie? Excuse me, sir. Do you have change for a five? Sure. Yo' yo, yo, yo. Come on. Come on. Mick. Mick. It's a little late for you to be out alone, isn't it? Well, I'm, uh, not alone. You're here. That's right. But I wouldn't be if my car wasn't in the shop. You know how it is. Let's go inside and have a drink. I'll call a cab. It's in my pocket... Left-hand pocket. Frankie. She's pretty, isn't she? Lech. - Be bop a Lula She's my baby. - Yo, Nick! Be bop a Lula Thanks. Rain from heaven. You sprayed it in my eyes! Nick, you all right, man? I can't see! Nick' I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Asshole. Jesus Christ. I'm blind. Sorry, man. - You're a real samurai, you know. - Get out of here! Did you get the money? Mickey, shut up for once. Well, of course I'm worried, Brian. You know what your brother did with his last term. And what I hear about the new school' it's only gonna positively reinforce all of his old bad habits. And this neighborhood isn't any help either. Because it just gives him an excuse to fail. What? That's terrific. No, no, no, don't bring anything. Just yourself. - Yeah. - Tell me all about... Oooh. How was the night? Not bad. Hey, there you are. First day at a new school. You ready for it? Aren't I always? I guess. You'd better get going. It's getting late. Sleep well, Dad. Okay. I stood there I waited. For those high school days. Little bit. I feel this whole world's on fire and I don't wanna get real burned. But I'm not gonna stand in line no more I'm gonna step out. Oh, God' I swear I would just love to find that guy from last night. I would just take that... Watch your mouth, scumbag, will ya? Hey, you watch your mouth. Hey, lust puppy. Lust puppy? Hey. Hey! Hey, you. Get over here. There's no bike riding on campus. I was just hoping I could take a quick ride through history. - You can pick it up after school. Park it in the rack. - Yes, sir. Frankie, come on, all right. I'll be there. Walk it over! Ever shoot anybody with that thing? All right, no drinking on campus. Nick, think we ought to do it? Hey, just chill. Chill, man. I think we're going to school. Frankie. Miss Wright. Morning, Howard. My mother said it was okay for me to stay out of biology class today... on account of my sinus condition. All those chemicals kind of makes me sick. Then have your mother take the class. We have to have someone sitting in your chair. But... You'll be late for class, Howard. Aw, man! Hey, babe. Mmm, mama. What's up? Not much. How you doing? Good. What's his story? Who cares? His ass is grass now. Let me have your blade. You'll never use it. Come on. Maybe I wanna clean my teeth. Let me have it. - Be careful. - Hiller. Hiller. Hiller! Come into my office. Later. You mind taking those off? I like to see who I'm talking to. Shakespeare, huh? Yeah. Actually, I don't know why I'm surprised. Your records show a good aptitude for reading and writing. Going to do anything with it? Excuse me? I don't know. Look, Morgan, you've had a good education in one of the best prep schools in this country. And if you chose to throw it away, well, luckily that's no concern of mine at this point. What is my concern is your present attitude, which is my way of saying that I won't tolerate any of your past bullshit. Including your rooftop... rock concerts in-between the classes. You see, I have a lot of trouble dealing with the real losers here at Lawson. I don't want to waste a lot of energy with a good imitation. Yes, sir. Good. All right. You'd better hustle out of here before you miss your first class. And so the original pioneers settled the territory... building towns on the lands they claimed. But there were men who lived outside the law. Men who took away the things the settlers had worked so hard to build. The settlers themselves were no match for these outlaws, and so a new breed was born. Known as the "gunfighters," they brought a new code... of honor and justice to the Old west. A code written in their blood and of the blood of the outlaws they faced. Bat Masterson. Wyatt Earp. - Whoa. State of the art. - Class, that's enough. Ed' will you please watch the film and pay attention? Sorry, man. I never had it out of my pocket before. Yeah? Well, why don't you learn how to use it before you cut your balls off? No settler could remain in those days without taking sides. Problems, Jimmy? No, uh... No problems. Can't get the damn thing closed. Looking back, one is struck by the fact that even though... specific crimes are frequently forgotten, the romantic pageantry remains. - Here. You're gonna need it. - Why? Take it. It's all over the school about you and Nick Hauser. Heads up, Jimmy. Heads up. Something important, Mr. Parker? Yeah. I was telling Morgan about this book I read. - Which one? - Call of the Wild. And, um, what was your reaction to this once-in-a-lifetime experience? I didn't get it. But I liked the dog. History books are filled with stories about lands... bought and paid for with the blood of the men and women who claimed them. When someone took a stand, they very often paid with their life, whether outlaw or gunfighter. The cost was always high. And many lives were given by those who shaped our beloved country... during this turbulent and historic era. Pow! What's up' man? You like music? Yeah, I like music. Yeah? Wanna come see my band tonight? Sure. Where? Go down here, down this main drag, past all the sleazy porno shops. Okay. It's on the left-hand side. You can't miss it. Porno shops? I'll be there. Good. All right, let's get this thing rolling! Come on, man. Yo, Nick! Be bop a Lula. Whoa! He just missed 'em, man. This must be recess, right? Great. Yo, Morgan. Yo! Wait up. Listen, man. You're heading towards trouble. That's Nick Hauser. They're playing with my bike. I'm just trying to save your life. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Nice hood ornament you got there. Hey, don't mess with them. They'll break your legs. There he is. There he is. Right there. Hi there. Hi. God, a real man wouldn't jump out of the way. Whoa. Yeah. It's John Wayne. Guy's got a damn death wish. Eddie, there he goes, man. Watch out. He's gonna kiss you. This is a very nice bike. Very nice. We like it. We're just taking it for a test run. You don't mind? Wanna make sure it works. Rain from heaven, maricon. Hey. Look at this guy. I think he's got the measles or something. Come on! Show us! So, what do you think? Should we let him have it? What? I said, should we let him have it? You want your bike back? Huh? Hey, bebop. Yo! You want your bike back? What do you think? Should I give him his bike back here? Make him pay! Should I give him his bike back? I said, should I give him his bike back? Give it back to him, Nick. Keep it. There it is. Come on. Good. You look beautiful like that. Red really looks great on you. Oh, shit. It was a nice bike! Hey, you guys... you guys are bad. This was a nice bike. Used to be. Damn. Hey' I'm sorry, man. I guess training was over. Hey, he said he was sorry. Life's a bitch' pal. Party's over. Shit. Hi, honey. How was the first day? Okay. What happened to your bike? Nothing. Nothing? Your bike is in pieces and you tell me nothing happened? All right, Morgan, if it's starting all over again... It's not starting again, okay? It was an accident. All right? No, it's not all right. Who's gonna pay for that? - Did you at least find out if they have any insurance? - Insurance? This isn't Connecticut! No one has insurance around here. Oh, now they don't even have insurance. That's wonderful! Hey, hey' what's going in here? That's what I'm trying to find out. It seems that we had a little accident with Morgan's bike. Oh, boy. Can you fix it? As soon as I learn to walk on water I'll get on it. Don't you take that tone of voice with your father! That bike cost $500! No shit. Morgan. You handle this. I don't want any more to do with it. What the hell am I supposed to say to that? I've been at this thing for two hours. You might be a little more understanding of her. Well, Dad, you know, I've been working on that my whole life. It's too late. To fall in love with Sharon Tate. But it's too soon. But the bull is gonna dance in the brain of Reverend Moon. I think that it's time that you're startin' to think about getting by. But I have that need to go out and find. Somebody to love. Very kind. Thank you. Thank you very much! It's too late. There's no one left that I even wanna imitate. But it's too soon to ask me for the words I want carved on my tomb. So I think that it's time. That you're all startin' to think about gettin' by. But I have that need to go and rely on. Somebody to love. You just don't know I'm here to give you my heart and you want some fashion show. So I think it's time. 'Cause I think it's too easy to rely. On worshiping devils and strangers in bed. Though they do get good drugs and they do give good head. Please, God, if You're up there, just let him see me. Come on, Ronnie. Jimmy isn't your type. Maybe if you moved the hair out of your eyes, you'd see how wrong you are. Pain in my heart, there he is. Thank you. Thank you. We'll be back in a bit with more tales from the crypt. Thank you. Nice dress. So where's he from? Connecticut. Connecticut. What do you do for fun back there? Met at the Yacht Club every Sunday. Is he serious? Never as far as I can tell. I was, actually. Have a good set. All right. Excuse me. One, two, three, four! Hey' let go of me. Who do you think you are, huh? Let go of me! Not until you tell me what your name is. That's my business. Bobby takes the gas Pedal to the floor. The voices He hears the voices. Coming from the traffic Coming from the cube. Like the cry of babies passing through a tube. Voices run inside you. There's gonna be trouble. Jill breathes carbon trailing from the bus. It's like staring in the eyes of Lazarus. The voices She hears the voices. Like a starving whisper no one ever heard. Like an epileptic hummingbird. Let me go! The voices She hears the voices. Coming from the traffic Coming from the cube. Like the cry of babies passing through a tube. Voices run inside you. Sal and Liz sitting at the zoo. Sal says I do but, Liz, do you. Yo, man, look at that. Talk about balls. You don't understand. Then enlighten me. They hear all the voices. Coming from the traffic Coming from the cube. Like the cry of babies passing through a tube. Voices run inside you. J.C.! Morgan, please. Nick. Nick! Yo! Yo! - Stop it! - Yo, that's Frankie man. Let me go! The voices She hears the voices. Coming from the traffic Coming from the cube. Like the cry of babies passing through a tube. - Voices run inside you. - Go ahead, go! Shit, man. Hey, Nick! - Get that asshole, will ya. - What? Oh, man. Get out of my way. Get out of my way, fag! Move, man. Move. Get out of my way. Get out of here. Move! Nick? What is she doing? I don't know. Get off me, man! You having a nice time? You take her home! The dance is over. Like the cry of babies passing through a tube. The voices run inside you. Hey, wait. Hey, wait! We're gonna serve this dude now, man. Come on! Just when I thought we were getting to be good friends. Come on. Come on. There's something wrong with this guy. What's wrong with you? I should just ice your ass right now. Yeah? Yeah. Why? 'Cause I danced with one of your boyfriends? That's some funny stuff. You owe me. Where are those keys, huh? You like that, don't ya? It's a little payment for services rendered. Oh, yeah. If I ever catch you near Frankie again, I'll take you out so fast you won't even have time to spit. Look at me. Look at me, man. Remember this' maricon. You'll feel better in the morning. Hit it, man! This is a bad car, Nick. We should have done this a long time ago. Yo, yo, yo, man. This is just like in that movie. Glad you could make it. God, I can't believe they took your car. I don't own a car, man. Shit! Ah, shit, Nick. I'm telling you, man, he's right behind us, Nick. What are we gonna say? Ah, shit, take this man. Where am I gonna put it? Put it under the seat! That's the first place he's gonna check, man. Nick, what are you gonna tell 'em? Shut up. Don't smile, Frankie. You know, you may be smart, Hiller, but you're dead meat when Nick gets out of jail. Well, Frankie, I thought you were going with such a nice, respectable guy. Yeah? Bye. So there I was in front of the review board. Now, Mom, I am talking about the entire review board. Shaking... Shaking like a bloody idiot. At one point, I was shaking so bad, I was gonna rattle right off the platform. It doesn't matter. Anyway, you still finished fourth in your class. Wait and see. In no time, you're going to be the best lawyer in the country. Well, now, I wouldn't go that far. Golden boy, how you doing? All right. How are you? Okay. - You in for the weekend? - More or less. - Can I borrow your car tonight? - Um, I don't know, Morgan. I was thinking of taking Mom out to a movie until Dad gets home. Well, I won't be gone long, Brian. I know that. And under any other circumstances, I'd let you have that car in a shot. Forget it. Morgan. I'll take care of this. Morgan? Morgan, will you just cool out? Give Mom a break. Just as soon as she gives me one. She already has, and look what you've done with it. What do you mean by that, Brian? I mean you cause trouble wherever you go. And Mother and Dad have spent a fortune in trying to keep you in decent schools, and all you can do is screw up. Brian, I'm real sorry. But you know I never wanted to go to any of those goddamn schools in the first place. How are you? Oh, man. You... How you doing? Where the hell did you get Nick's car, man? His bro called my bro. Wanted him to come pick it up and he wasn't home. So, here I am. Your pants are still dry. Here, let me give you a ride. I think I'd like to drive. Don't you trust my driving expertise? Yeah, but it's always been like that, you know. If I didn't follow my big brother Brian's lead, I was invisible. Yeah? It was the same with my family, you know, except my ma wouldn't let me join a gang because Donnie got his ass kicked so bad, so she just outlawed it. Yeah. What happens if you break tradition? I don't know. I don't wanna find out. I think this is one of Nick's favorites. I don't know. If you ask me, he's either the toughest guy at Lawson, or the stupidest. No way. He went to one of those brain factories back East, and I mean the guy's head is totally crammed. - Yeah, with bullshit. - What's the matter with her? She's pining 'cause Nick's still in the cooler. You know how she gets when she isn't getting any. Yeah, well, if you ask me she's got the hots for you-know-who. I saw the way she was dancing with him the other night. Body heat on contact. And I mean sizzling. Let's go, Ron. - I think the air's getting a little thick around here. - Frankie, I'm not finished yet. Oh? You are now. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Forget it, man. She's bad news. Come on. I just wanna talk to her, man. She belongs to Nick. Come on, Jimmy. Lincoln freed the slaves. All I wanna do is talk to her. All I wanna do is live. Hey, Nick's out. Come on. Get in the back, Jimmy. Get in the back. No! I'll get in the back. You! Hello, Frankie. Thank you, God! What do you do when opposites attract. What do you do when opposites attract. What do you do when opposites attract. What do you do. What can you do when your worlds collide. Come on, Frankie. Don't be mad. Lovers seek a new sensation. You know, Frankie' all I wanna do is talk to you. I just spent the last 20 minutes telling you I got nothing to say to you. You got it? Now let me out! Let her out, man. I just wanna work this out. I just wanna talk to you, you know. Work it out, Frankie. Go for it! Go for it? We got nothing to go for? Look, you blew it and now you have to pay. Come on, Frankie. Come on. You don't mean that. Yes, she does. No, she doesn't. Just stay out of... Nice smile. Thanks. But it still doesn't change nothing between us. I don't know about that. I got a smile. I figure if I wait long enough, I can... Get lucky? Don't hold your breath, Morgan. Oh, gonna break the rules. Oh, gonna change the news. Oh, gonna take a chance with the possibilities. Possibilities Possibilities. What do you do when opposites attract. Like it or not it's a natural reaction. Lovers seek a new sensation. Wow, man, where are we? Other side of the world, man. Oh, Chateaubriand. Look at that one. I can't believe it. It's outrageous. Oh' my God. Possibilities Possibilities. This is amazing. Look at the size of that one! Wow! Check out that lawn! It's a block long of perfect green. It's a golf course, Ron. Ron, you're an inspiration. Tee-off time, huh? No, I think we're gonna eat. Eat? What, you have a rich uncle or something? No. It's Friday, juniors night. These places are all the same. I suppose they won't mind if I don't wear my furs. Come on. Just straighten up your clothes. Jimmy, do up your shirt. - I'll handle the rest. - Am I completely hopeless? Of course not. Just don't say anything but "fabulous" unless they put a gun to your head. Why? 'Cause you just got in from Europe. You don't know how to say anything else. Okay. Come on, Frankie. Come on. Come on. Here, put that on. God. This thing is so heavy, Morgan. Here, hold this for me. I'll fix your button. That looks good. Want some lipstick? No thanks. Oh, come on. No! All right, fine. Put these on. Do I look okay? Perfect. Come on. Let's go. Here you go. Look bored. That won't be hard for Frankie. She's always bored. It's only good for about 20 minutes. So eat fast. Come on. Well, shake it up baby, now Shake it up, baby. - Twist and shout. - Twist and shout. Come on, come on come on, baby, now Come on, baby. - Let's work it on out. - Work it on out. Work it on out work it on out Patty! Alan? Haven't seen 'em in years. How are you anyway? Come on, Frankie. Fabulous. Young man? Young man? Young man! I need to see your, uh' membership card, please. Oh, God, Reynolds, I'm glad it's you. I feel such the fool. I left it down in my locker with my tennis rags. It's still stuck with the racket. I'm sure Patty and Alan will vouch for us. Love your suit. Tre fabulouso. Wow, this is great! Shake it up, baby, now. Oh, God. You know what to do. Hey. Everybody's staring at me. Yes, they are. Well, what's happening here now is' you see, the girls are wondering where they've seen you before. The guys are wondering why the hell they haven't. Well, shake it' shake it shake it, baby, now Chuck wagon. Chuckie wagon. I like that. Come on. Let's eat. I was just walking by and I just saw this beautiful aura coming up over both of you. I just wanted to come by and share that. That's a great shirt. Can you believe this place? There's not a zit in the house. You kind of look like a Gary. Can I call you Gary? You mean Frankie. I can't believe you guys don't know her. You mix the wrong things, this is really not gonna come together... and you're gonna wind up launching your lunch all over the damn place. In from Europe for two weeks. Very high concept, guys. Don't let them fool you. Of course size matters. This is the '80s. Anyway, what I'm saying is you should watch what you eat. You know what I mean? The cracked crab is to die for. The dill sauce is what makes it. I'm not talking about size in bed. We're all the same size in bed. Good evening. Does the word phrase "beautiful, beautiful hair" mean anything to you? It's got a certain je Ne sais quoil can't quite figure out. I think it's the sherry, but I'm not sure. I'm dying to find out. This isn't a fashion statement. It's a sweater. She had the most gorgeous boyfriend. He was incredible. Stunning. But did you ever see those little cocktail wieners? You know the ones? The real, little tiny ones? Of course, the finger sandwiches, you can never go wrong with them. If I'm having a small party, 25, 30 people, you get the watercress, slice the purple onion very thin' touch of butter, cut the crust off the bread, you got it made. We are working currently with Barry Manilow. You know him? I know Barry very well. You figure you're gonna wrap it up in wax paper, toss it in the fridge, you got it the next day for brunch with bloodies. At first, I gagged. But after a while it was really easy. But you guys swallow it, don't you? Mm-hmm. I'd like to say in all sincerity, this is the most fun I've ever had. You're a fantastic crowd. I'm having a terrific... That couple over there. Bet you came in a B.M.W. tonight, didn't you? I came in a B.M.W. once. Ronnie, what is this? Who cares? Just eat it. You'll never see it again. I'm not gonna eat it. You eat it. No' no.

Well, it's just the other side of the hill. Yeah. What did you mean when you sang that song? Just what I said. It's funny. I never heard a guy say anything like that before. Nick never needs anyone, you know. Well, I... think he needs you. So what's the story with you? I mean, uh, were you really rich before you moved here, or is that just another one of Ronnie's famous rumors? Yeah. We were doing all right. Then my father lost his business. Are you gonna go back there? I mean' to college and stuff? No, I wasn't planning on it. What about you? Are you gonna go for the scholastic gold? Are you kidding? I'd be lucky if I graduate. No, I'll probably just get married. You don't need college for that. Your parents happy about that? My dad is. My mom died of cancer last year. Sorry. So, feel like dancing? Yeah, I feel like dancing. Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts and hold on to your bobby socks. The Club '60s is proud to present the toughest band on the turf or in the surf.

Just what I said, all right? Just what you said! Don't... Don't you... Don't you lie to me. I'm not lying to you. And if you ever touch me like that again, Nick, I swear you'll wish to God you never set eyes on me. You got it? You got it? Good. Damn it! I'm sorry. Come on. I said I'm sorry. This makes me crazy. How do you think I felt knowing you were out with this jerk-off? Well, don't take it out on me, all right? I know. I know. I said I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. I really missed you.

No, that's it. Nice try. How's it going? Oh, it's not bad. Actually, California real estate laws... are remarkably similar to Connecticut's. Good. I don't think the test is going to be any problem. Morgan home yet? Haven't seen him. He's probably out with his friends. Morgan? Morgan! I'll check on him. Good God. Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right. What happened? Same thing that always happens. I screwed up. You wanna talk about it? Look, Morgan. I know that this move has been difficult for you. It hasn't been easy for any of us. I'd like to think that if you're having problems, you'd come and talk to me about it. And say what, Dad? The prodigal son's in trouble again? He can't cut it, rich or poor. Come on, Dad. You know, we've been through this. I'm not Brian. I can't live my life like that. All right. Knock it off! Just... Just cut out that self-pitying crap. I don't want you to be Brian. I want you to be you. All right. So you screwed up. So what? I expect you to make mistakes. That's what life's all about, for God's sakes. How else are you gonna learn who you are and what you believe in? What do I do right now? Right now you do what you really wanna do. Do whatever it is you... That you know is right, that you believe in. That's all. And feel good about it. Look, son. Life isn't a problem to be solved. It's a mystery to be lived. So live it. You're a good man. You are, you know. Give yourself a break. Take it easy on yourself. We're gonna eat in about a half hour if you wanna come down. Where's Morgan? He's lying down. What's the matter? Is something wrong? Nothing he can't handle. What's for dinner? New England clam chowder. Fabulous, fabulous. And you? Oh, wonderful, darling. No, really, I'd love to make it for some lobster tonight, but we've been having so much of it at home that I'm afraid it's coming out of our ears. What's a girl to do? Looks like I died. Definitely not. Frankie? Nick's on his way over. Thanks. No, probably never get laid anyway. Oh, no! Morgan! Hello, Frankie. Turn it off! Turn it off? You can't just turn this off. Listen to it. You might just like it. Please turn it off. Frankie, I thought you wanted more. This isn't exactly what I had it mind. Morgan, what are you doing? Morgan. What are you doing? Climbing up the stairs. Please don't. Why not? After the locker room today... Oh, my God. Wounds of love, Frankie. Gimme a break. I am. Morgan, I'm serious. Frankie, what's so unreasonable about knowing me? Nothing. And everything. Morgan, look, you gotta go, okay? Well, I don't wanna go till you explain to me. What's there to explain? I'm here and you're there. We don't fit. You know, all I'm asking for is a shot, Frankie. It's not going to change anything. It could. It could. A chance is worth everything. Frankie, get out here! Now do you see why you have to go? Frankie! I'm coming! Come to my house for dinner tomorrow night. No way! Hey, Frankie! Forget it. Want me to get that? All right. Come on! I'm coming. I'll be there. It's for you. Read it' really. Read it. Now go, Morgan! Go! Get out of here! I'm coming! God. Come on! What are you doing in here? Nothing! Can't a girl have any privacy around here? Yeah, but not when we wanna celebrate. Celebrate? That's right. It's not every night I get asked for my baby's hand. You gonna open that? What? Yep. Can you believe this? And he said yes. I'm so happy, sweetheart. How do you open this stuff? I only wish Mama were here to celebrate with us. There we go. Morgan! Morgan! Wait up! Hey, Jimmy! Isn't it great? You did all the work yourself? Yeah, just about. It's tremendous! Yeah. It's got your name on it. It's really great. It's yours. Consolation prize. Consolation? Consolation for what? I love this guy! Good attitude, man. Hell, they're not going to get married till after graduation anyway, right? - Check it out. - What are you talking about? Nick's marrying Frankie. Isn't that what we're talking about? I can't believe it. Where are you going? Morgan! Hey, you on the bike, hey! Go get him, copper! So, are you gonna get a ring? If you do, get it at Woolworth's. Susie Ristelli got hers there. It almost looks like the real thing. I saw it. It really does. It's amazing. I wanna get one. Frankie, I just heard... I wanna talk to you. He's crazy. Wow. Total romance. I thought you were coming for dinner tonight. I am! Frankie. When, Frankie? After the wedding? Come on. You don't have to be a piece of his turf. Look. I'm not his. I can make my own choices, Morgan. I'll be there. Go easy on him tonight, Page. This means a lot to him. Mm-hmm. So did that girl he brought home for Easter last year, remember? She was so stoned, all she could do was look at the peas and say, "Wow, they're so green." She was kinda cute. No, really, this is different. He's really trying. So am I. I'll get it. C-Come on in. Come on in. Oh, I, uh, I brought your book. How'd you like it? It was good. A little crazy. I never met anybody that felt things that way. Yeah. Well, are we gonna stand here all night? Thank you. Oh, thank you. You know, I think you would have really enjoyed spending time with us in Connecticut, Frankie. There was always so much to do. Our house was right on the Sound. Skiing, boating. Morgan was quite a good yachtsman in his own way. You were. Don't you think he was better than Brian, David? Mm. I think so. If only he would put a little heart into it. Of course, none of that matters very much now. I mean, since we've moved. What a pretty picture. What's with Frankie, man? Get outta here. What? Get outta here, I said, Eddie. Get outta here. You lived in the Los Angeles area all your life, Frankie? Yeah. I mean, uh, yes, sir, my whole life. Well, then you must have been to the Huntington Gardens. Have you? Oh' I hear the roses are absolutely fabulous. I don't think that Frankie goes for things like that very much. She spends most of her spare time reading. Oh, well, since you've never been there either, maybe we should go together one of these days. We'll bring your mother along. We'll make a day of it. I mean, if she likes roses. Does she? Oh, don't worry about that. It's all right. These things happen. You'd better get into the kitchen, put some cold water on that before it stains. It's all right. Her mother's dead. I didn't know that. How was I supposed to know that? Let me see. It's ruined. Here, let me... Look. Why don't you just go talk about roses or something? Frankie, she didn't mean anything by it. Right' Morgan. Frankie. Morgan, I'm sorry. Frankie! Frankie! Excuse me! I promised Ronnie I'd meet her at Woolworth's to look at wedding rings. You know, Frankie, you don't belong to Nick. Well, maybe not, but I don't belong to you either. Can we take him out now? No, he's later. I gotta go see my girlfriend now. Hi, baby. Where you going? I've been looking all over the place for you. Frankie? You're missing your mama again, aren't you? Come here. Come here. Why don't you come with us? Come on. Come on. Teddy sniffing glue he was 12 years old. Fell from the roof on east two-nine Kathy was 11 when she pulled the plug I'm sorry, Nick. I'm just so... Check that out. I know. No, come on. Come on. Gimme a kiss. Just kiss me. A good one. Yo, man, gimme that bottle. Come on. Here. It won't go on, man. That'll clear things up, right? Better? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. So. So, what do you think? You guys feel like, uh, kicking up a little dust or what? Yeah, man. It's about time. I'm serious. Jesus Christ. Yo, let's hit Feather's pad. Yeah. Some bitchin' proof And Herbie said Tony, can you fly. But Tony couldn't fly Tony died. Those are people who died, died. Those are people who died, died. They were all my friends and they just died Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room Bobby hung himself from his cell in the tombs Judy jumped in front of a subway train Eddie got slit in the jugular vein. And, Eddie, I miss you more than all the others. And I salute you, brother. Those are people who died, died. Those are people who died, died. They were all my friends and they just died. Yo, Nick. How much longer are we gonna be doing this, man? We've been driving around for hours, bro. That's right, and we're gonna keep on driving until I find what we're looking for. I hope you find it soon, man, 'cause I'm about to pee in my pants. So, shoot it out the window, man. Christ, just use your head. Not a bad idea. Hold onto this, bro. Chill out. All right, move. This guy needs a lifestyle. Yo! Good news, America. Coming through. Hey, it's chilly out here. Died, died Those are people who died, died. Those are people who died, died. They were all my friends, and they just died. Oh' shit! I can't believe this. We're running out of gas. What? I said, we're running out of gas. Here, uh' why don't you take this watch and go ask that cabdriver... if he'll trade it in for a little change? I gave you this watch, Nick. Don't you have any money? If I did' I wouldn't ask you to trade it. Come on. Uh, I can't do it, Nick. I mean, I'd rather walk than trade in this watch, you know? I mean' I gave it to you, you know? That's nice. But why can't you do it, really? Why? 'Cause that's Hiller's father, huh? Is that why? Is that why? Come on. Come on. I asked you a question. Come on! Yes. Well, maybe you should have thought of all that before you became involved in this. Now go out there. No. Frankie, I said go out there. No. I said go out there. Now get out there! You've got to get out of here. Please listen to me. You gotta go! Calm down. I don't think you understand. You gotta go! Nick, let's go. Nick, let's go. Nick, come on. Let's go, man! Frankie. It'll be okay, Nick. Come on! Dad? Dad? Don't worry. He's very strong. Mom? Mom? Brian. I'm so sorry. It's all right. The doctor says he'll be all right. Ow. Sorry. It's a bad one. Yeah, I know. I can feel it clear into next week. Want me to stop? No. No. Sorry. I just keep hearing that... That gun go off over and over again. It hurts so bad. How do you deal with it? I don't know. I don't. No, I just... keep exploding. Wreaking havoc on everyone's lives. I, uh, thought things were supposed to be easy when you had money. Yeah, if you don't take it seriously. How do you do that? By letting it go. I don't think you can hold on to anything... until you let it go. Sure, honey, I understand. Of course, I just want you to be happy. It's just that I thought that you and Nick... Nick what? Nick what? You bitch! You bitch! I saw you! I saw you! - Hey, what are you doing? - Get off of me! You don't own me, you bastard! You don't own me! You don't own me! Let me go! Put me down! How can you do this? How can you do this? You don't even care! Nick, no, please! Call your boyfriend. Come on. Nick, please, don't! Call him! I want you to call him. Call him. I said call him! Hello. Morgan, stay away from him. He'll kill you. I swear to God he'll kill you, Morgan. Hey, Bebop, you listen to me. Nobody takes anything that I own. Nobody! I'll kill her first, man. You got that? You be at the warehouse in 20 minutes. You got that? Hel... Morgan? I wanna talk to you. How's Dad? He's a little bit better. He asked about you. Now, are you gonna tell me what kind of trouble you're in before the police get here? Hmm? It's nothing I can't handle. I am just trying... Morgan, don't walk away from me! What do you want, Brian, huh? Why don't you tell me what a waste my life is, huh? Or give me a lecture on the rules of the game. Well, I hate to tell you, big brother, but the rules have changed a little. You leave this house, I'll have you picked up within 24 hours. Great. I can use all the help I can get tonight. Get the hell out of my way, Brian. Chico, Se pase. Is Jimmy here? Is Jimmy here? Over here. No. - Do you know where he is? - Yeah. Probably out with Ronnie getting his chain pulled. If you see him, give him this. Donnie, all right? Yeah, yeah. What is this, your will? Ah! Hey, Nick. This is bullshit, man. How much longer are we gonna have to wait? Shut up, asshole! I swear to God I'll kill you if you mess this up, Mickey. No one says a word. You got that? Bernie, go back to where I told you, all right? Hey. Come here. Come on, little puppy dog. Come on, puppy. Sit. Sit. Sit down. Oh, that's a good girl. I don't even know who you are. Like, I can't even look at your face. Get that faggot! Come on! You crazy? Nick! Shit! Shit, dog, come on! Let him go. Move back, Nick. Move back, I said! I said move back! Okay. You're right. You're right. I... Look, look, look. It's over. It was all for you. You didn't do it for me. It's your whole life! How many bullets are left, huh, Nick? Enough for Morgan? My father? Frankie, come on. For anyone who isn't part of your turf? Come on. How many, huh? Excuse me? Huh? Come on. Let's go.
