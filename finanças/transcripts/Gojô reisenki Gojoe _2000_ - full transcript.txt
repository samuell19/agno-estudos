Hey! Huh? You think Tankai will let him die so easily? You're right... He's going to fight Benkei. I won. Hey, what are you doing? Who are you betting on? Of course... I bet on Tankai. I'm going to bet on Benkei. Benkei. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. You guys don't know how to gamble. I'm betting on Benkei. I'll go see it for myself. Hey! Where are you going? Give it back! Musashibo Benkei! Die! Let go! Hey punk, who sent you? No one sent me! What? Then why are you after my life? To avenge my mother's death! You attacked her at Tsugizakura shrine in Kumano. And you impregnated her with me! She gave birth to me, so that I could send you to hell. So are you my... You are already dead... Had a nightmare? We've done our job. Benkei's been delivered to the Devil's Wood... Just as Security Chief Tadanori asked. But... ...now I'm going to do whatever I want. Pick your weapon. I'm not fighting with anyone. You coward! Tankai... Do you still not understand? We are all hostages here, completely surrounded... ...and a terrible darkness is approaching. Flee while you still can! Spare me your cheap ruses, and defend your honor! What's this? The moon invades the sun? The sun is eaten by the moon. An apparition that appears once every 100 years... No! Turn not to the darkness! Nor the demon's will! Curses upon the Heike Where are they? Over there! Where are they? Don't panic! Mind your aim! Don't panic! Let fly now! The fate of the entire Heike Clan rests on the fate of two demons? They've come. They are here! They're just punks. Hold your ground! Damn demon! Violated... Torn asunder... All is for naught... We are undone. We've been betrayed. Attack! Who in hell are you? Stop! It's the Gojoe Demon. Leave him to me. Gojoe Demon! Prepare to die! The demon's killed our Leader! Shanao. Why? One thousand souls? Come for me. Why do you flee? To quiet your demon spirit. No. It is you whose spirit needs rest. Why should a demon like you be so indecisive? Reveal to me your true demon self. It's time you died on the Demon Slayer! Alas... Acalanatha's revelation was a delusion. Begin your training all over again. What are you doing? Have you lost your royal mind? I will now begin nine days of fasting. I will challenge the Holy Priest, Ajari. What! I will challenge the power of Buddha. Prince Shanao! Have you forgotten the shame of your father's execution? You are the symbol of the Genji family... The physical form of Genji vengeance! This is not the time for self-abnegation! I have passed the state of killing for revenge. I sense something new... But something is lacking... Still lacking. Are you running away? What happened to slaying demons? Damned monk! What brought you here? I came to report something. I see. What is it? I realized that gods are all incompetent. And I have received enlightenment. I see. How will the gods you believe in save this chaotic world? How? Don't try to evade my question. Or do you acknowledge the fact that you are helpless? Indeed. I am just a monk, who loves nature. Then I will tell you... The gods people believe in are mere illusions. The one who can save the world from devastation is the true god. The true god has the true power. I have gained the true power. I have gained the power to rule. I pray to no god. I see... The only god I will trust is my power. The Devil of Kurama, Vaisravana, Sahasrabhuja... I have received their powers. And tonight, I will take yours. I cannot help you. It is no use killing me. Are you begging for your life? Do you not understand? I will not stop you from killing me... However, I will not be able to help you. Shanao! I can tell that you are a man of great spiritual dimension. I am but an undeserving soul, who has come to this place of deliverance... ...out of the desire to follow in the footsteps of the godhead. Yet, my devotion has weakened. I cannot, and yet I must die in pious immolation. You are a blessing, sent to set me ablaze. I am prepared, anointed with oils... Please help deliver me. I am ready to receive the flames. I cannot. Please find another way. No, this is the only solution. It is my last request. Release me from my hesitation! Offer me your strength! Let go... I have no such power, I can't release another from their misery. Help me! Deliver me! I beg of you! Benkei, why do you flee? I am not an illusion. However, the path that you pretend to is one. Your enlightenment will not come that way. Shanao! Return to me, Benkei. Return to Kyoto and challenge me. No one will cloud your decision anymore. No one will cloud your decision anymore. Come and challenge me. Ajari! It's the end! It's the end! It's the end! Yeah? Why not? Why not! Hey. Huh? Whatever happened to Benkei? Damned monk's long gone. And that talk about slaying the demon... Benkei just stirred him up and dropped him in our laps. That's about the size of it. I guess I'll have to steal those 1,000 swords myself after all. It's the end and who cares? The world has come to an end when a holy monk like him gets slain... I told you, this is useless. Let's burn it... We're outta here! So long, Kyoto! Burn, burn, let it all burn! Who cares! Burn! Yeah! Burn! Burn! Burn, let it all burn! Burn! Well if it ain't the police! Something the matter? It's the end of the world and we don't care! You got a problem with that? What are you doing? Fire! What are you doing here? Everyone's dead... ...and you're the last person I want to see. Perfect place for a 'damned scavenger,' huh? Hope you like it. Because this hell is all your doing. Amazing, huh? You monks and your magic powers. Give it up. I said, it's hopeless. What's so special about being alive anyway? Hey... I don't care whether you're after monks or demons... ...but cut this in-between crap. This is the end. What? This will be my last deed as a monk. Tough little brat. Tetsukichi. Where is the Demon Slayer? Prince Shanao. Benkei has begun to move. I could feel it. He has finally realized what he really is. Tonight, your escorts come to take you to our stronghold. I would gladly lay down my life to save yours. Shoshinbo. Do not fret so. After my duel, we will join our forces in the East. And I will assume my appointed name, "Yoshitsune Genji." You honor me with your acceptance. And the duel, where will it be? Where else... ...but Gojoe. Just stay down and watch the kid. That's my sword! That's my sword! You still don't understand? The wrath of the heavens are upon him! Now I'll show you the fury of a real demon. Prince Shanao! Old man... Old man! Where are you? Old man? Come on! Come on! Hey! You tough little brat! Comrade Shoshinbo! What is the meaning of this? What is happening on Gojoe? There was an incident with the Heike... ...but now everything has been made clear. Gentlemen. The lost son of Yoshitomo, Prince Shanao! Your Highness. Yes. Hereafter, I shall rule as Yoshitsune Genji. And here with His Highness... ...the most famous warrior monk in Kyoto, now aligned to the Genji Clan... Musashibo Benkei. Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! Where are you? Benkei! Benkei! Where are you? Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! The end
