Exterior. Night. Establishing shot. Wide angle on a dark forest. The sky is black. It's raining and bleak. There's nobody here but these black cats. Or at least, so we believe. They're just cats. The weather in stories is a reflection of the protagonist's inner state. In real life, the weather would never be like this in Jeddah. In this case, it represents the third year of high school. The hardest year of my life. Everyone knows this is the year that determines your future. The finals are a headache but the GATs are a migraine. Thankfully, I did well in the SATs. Mostly because it doesn't depend on studying. By the way, I suck at studying. My mom says I'll be a security guard when I grow up. If you don't study math, you'll end up a security guard in the mall. If you don't study your spelling, you'll be a security guard in the market. You'll be a security guard in Jeddah Mall. Sawary Landmark. Hossam, you'll be a security guard in The Red Sea Mall. So of course, I grew up thinking I was going to be a security guard Man, I swear, I'm just gonna exchange these pants. Sorry, single males are not permitted. So this year will determine my future. I'll work on my GATs, on the subjects that-- Hossam, are you done studying? Still have some stuff left. Bless you, dear. When you're done, I made you an egg sandwich. Sure, Mom. But the problem, as I said before, is that I suck at studying. Because this is not what I want to do. I have a huge problem. For God's sake, take the shot. I won't drink this crap again. Don't worry, don't worry. Scene 41B. Take 1. I can't stop working on my film. Dude, you should have seen yesterday. Abdullah Bighead, he fell. We were all laughing. He was shooting the ball, his head tilted, then he slipped in some water. We just kept laughing at him. Dude, it was such a show. Damn, man, shut up. I forgot the flag. You're kidding, right? How did you know? Dude, I'm kidding. I brought it, see? We don't have time for this, Ma'an. Let me smell your hand right now! Sir, I don't smoke, I swear. Mr. Orabi, they say Al-Ittihad's fans were in bed real early last night. I'll shut your mouth for you, boy. Move it! Did you bring the cigarettes? Watch out. We have to upload the Saher sketch today. So Uturn can't steal our idea. Dude, nobody at Uturn watches our show. Our viewership sucks. We all get our ideas from Twitter. Sideburns are not allowed. -All of you, go shave now. -I won't lay a used blade on my face. -You'll only shave with it. -What about AIDS? Go shave! You want me to shave your mustache? Like Sayari last week? -No. -Shave it or I'll do it for you. Go after him. Hey, student! Listen, this guy Ibrahim is smart. Don't speak with him. I'll handle him. Not even a word. I know how to talk. Don't speak with him, I'll manage Ibrahim. -Are lights OK? -No, Why haven't you brought red? It's heavy, bro. Heavy? Give it to me. Move over. Once the national anthem starts, act like a football player. The national anthem. Cut! Dude, that's awesome. Wow! Let's see that again. And Now, the news from Jeddah. NEWS Dear speeder, who gets caught on camera every ten meters. You think you're in a photo studio or what? Unbelievable! Every day you pay, you speed fiends. When are you going to realize? Come on! I swear this episode will be a hit. When will it be out? -Be honest. -I swear I am. The shot's really good. See? No money, no budget, no Hollywood. -A camera and brains, that's it. -No one else on YouTube can do this. If Uturn wanted to do this, they'd do an open call on social media. They'd make a lot of noise and then 17 people show up. Listen, Hossam. It's time to make your movie. -The story's so good. -Ma'an, take it easy. We're not shooting my film until we finish college. Come on, dude, let's just start on it. Alright, that's fine. So boys, how's the studying going? We've done six chapters, Sir. The whole syllabus is six chapters, we only finished the summary the teacher gave us. It's very important that you study hard this year. This year separates the men from the boys. Which one will determine your future? The boy or the man? I'm sorry, but shorts are not permitted. -Listen! -Calm down! I'll wear whatever I want to the mall. Even a bikini. I'm sorry! We're good in chemistry, physics and national education. We just have chemistry, physics-- Dad. Would you like me to fix your hookah? God bless you, son. The Hangover, the best comedy this year. Also, the sixth Harry Potter. Great as usual. There's the second Twilight. It's crap, but people like this stuff. There are also nine new films, all in 2009. No need, friend. We've installed DSL and we're working well. God, that garbage… Saleh, the movies I bring you are DVD rips with subtitle files. But the films I'm downloading has built-in translation. How many times have I told you films with built-in translations come out pixelated. You know I don't understand. I sell you the movie for 5 Riyals, you sell it for 25, and now it's not good enough? -Forget it. He's a donkey. -Who are you calling a donkey? -Not you. This donkey on the cover. -No one spoke to you. Listen, I don't need this stupidity. Take your donkey friend and leave. What are you looking at, Mr. Piscelated? Get the hell out, you damn kids! Shit. That means no money. We'll drop the car sketch. We can only shoot the inventor sketch. -What inventor? -The physics lab sketch. No! Take that food out of your mouth, you moron! What do you think this is? An open buffet? I swear, Orabi needs to smoke a hookah. Everyone stay where you are. Sit down! Mohamed Alamoody. Abdullah Alghamdi. Ahmed Alnoory. Abdelaziz Alsawat. The second week without your books. If you forget them again next week, you won't be allowed into the lab. Salaam alaikum. We have to catch the next class. Are you fed up with paying speeding fines? Why get caught speeding on camera and pay 300 or 600 Riyals, when you don't even have 10 Riyals to buy Albaik's nuggets? Stand still. -Where's the box? -Right there, under the table. Ok. Throw it and catch it in the air, so the cut will be smooth, OK? Action! Now, with our camera, you'll be the one to shoot the speed cams. If it shoots you on Alharameen Highway, take your own shot and warn the others. Cut! Amazing, so amazing. Amazing! Continue your shot. Come here, boy! Give me that camera, quickly. Quickly! Making fun of the teachers, huh? Sicko. What are you doing here? Answer me! Please, we're just filming. I have a program on YouTube. It's called With Yourself. You have a program? I swear, if I can just show you. Just give me a chance. Show me in the Principal's office. God bless you. I just wanna show you. -Why didn't you bring a TV as well? -Just give me a chance, please. I swear it's a program with a purpose. Dear drama people in Ramadan shows. Why don't you just stick to comedy. Yes, it's flawed, but at least we're not crying out of embarrassment. He's going to throw the book at us. I had nothing to do with the accident. How come? Didn't you hit the guy? -Yes, but I swear-- -Officer! Bring the documents. Look! That's you? Yes, I was in Tash, season 4. The glass wasn't broken. I don't know, maybe I left the keys in the car. He keeps looking at the camera. How was the car stolen if you left the keys inside? You don't have any lines? Yeah, this was a simple role for me, but I got to learn about the whole production process. God bless you. That's wonderful, Sir. Can we go now? That's it? That's all you can say? I'm telling you I acted in Tash. Well, good for you. Listen, Mr. Student Director, I'm honestly embarrassed to ask, but I want to act with you. Huh? Sure, Sir. Perhaps we can do that tomorrow? Get that camera rolling now! Come on. Quickly! I am Abususta. And this is my boy, Susta. We're coming down the Mecca Highway, minding our own business, then suddenly the speed cam caught us. The speed cam caught us. Susta! Tell them Susta. Yes, speed cams are not good. I pulled over, pull the handbrake, and I tell Susta to just wait for me here. I take out a pipe from underneath the car. Not like this one. A thicker one, like from the bathroom. I go to the camera and I say, "Come here, you." Damn you. -How was that, director? -Excellent. Very promising, Mr. Orabi. Shall we start shooting tomorrow? Huh? I'd never let him act with us. Have you lost your mind? First, he's Orabi. His hobby is beating us. Second, all grown-ups have bad taste. Third, Orabi is crazy. Bro, imagine if Orabi was our friend. We'd be untouchable at school. Plus, his acting was really good. Did you see the scene he showed us? He was an extra on Tash. The worst show in the world. Someone falls over and you get the funny music, because the comedy sure ain't funny. -Hello to the directors. -Hi Bakri, welcome. Oh, you're already sitting I just saw one hell of a film last night, boys. A vampire movie, a horrifying one, not like the old horror films that-- -Twilight? -How did you know? That movie sucks, man. Oh no, no way. Hollywood movies get worse every year. Where are the classics? Check out this philosopher. When you type "2010 films" on Google, it's like typing "2010 poetry", -"2010 Music", "2010 paintings"… -Who's that noob? -Hussam, you bastard. -…Films are timeless. The best films were in the 60s or 70s. The Godfather, for instance, and-- -Orabi caught us filming today. -Shit. Seriously? He wants to act in With Yourself. Huh? -With Yourself, our program on YouTube. -Oh, that amazing program. And this is my boy, Susta. We're coming down… That's sick. 5,000 views! See, I told you. Ten people subscribed today. Have you lost your mind, having Orabi working with us? -Calm down. -It'll become educational. Calm down. I am calm. My advice? If he controls your grades, you do anything for him. If you need something from a dog, you call it "Sir". -Need anything, boys? -Thank you. -Calm down. -Stop! Pray Isha'a and calm down, calm down… He isn't gone yet, you moron. Look, he's still there. God is great, I know it all, I'm a legend, I drink red bull all the time. Listen! She passed me while I was boarding. I didn't know who she was. When I sat down, she turned out to be the flight attendant. A hot Russian. I tried to flirt with her and… I've been reading about pedophiles. Most of them look for jobs near kids. Pediatrician, primary school teacher-- Marlboro, bro. Sure. First, we're not kids. Second, Orabi is a crazy moron, not a pedophile. Third, have you seen your mustache? Well, maybe you're safe, but did you know I reached puberty late? Maybe I'm his type. For God's sake, man. We just tell him, "No, thank you," then leave. Listen, we can't just dismiss him. He's good Let's agree on a safe word, just in case it gets risky. -I'll say "Firecrackers", OK? -Sure. -Hossam, did you hear me? Firecrackers. -Move it. OK, guys. I've watched all the episodes of your With Yourself program. You've put in quite an effort and you should be thanked for it. That's why I'll be your top supporter and I'll be at your disposal. I think Sir, the problem is… that if we worked together, there might be some difficulty in making decisions, given the student-teacher relationship. Please, guys, I want you to separate physics Orabi from artist Orabi. Sure. But we've learned since childhood to obey teachers. -In fact, I fear that-- -Don't say, "I fear." Not fear. I am afraid… it would mess up the program. That's true. Intellectual differences are possible. But we're going to be able to set With Yourself aside. By the way, I really admire you. Last night, I made ten accounts and subscribed them all to the program. God bless! Seems like a hangout. Shall I get two hookahs for you, or are you cool? Get straight to Mr. Mosleh's office! Ibrahim Abu Hakra. What brings you here? Mr. Orabi, my sincere apologies. I had no idea you were meeting here. Why are you still standing there? Get out of here! Ibrahim… If I may, please. I asked Ibrahim to come, because he's in the order committee. If my camera were confiscated, he could help us. So, I called and got him involved. Yeah. Dude, come and sit. Sit down. OK, where were we? Yes… We can make a program or a TV series. Short episodes, like Tash Ma Tash. Oh. Tash is amazing, epic. See? So we can-- One minute, please. If you'll allow me, Mr. Orabi. With utmost respect to your role as an extra in Tash, Tash is the reason that Saudi TV is behind the times. My dear, Tash is the best Saudi show ever. Tash is what got you interested in this field essentially. I'm interested in changing that farce that's been on TV for 15 years. Who taught you to write a joke? Who taught you to even write a story? Quentin Tarantino taught me. Lynch. Anderson. -People you've never heard of. -Western names? No pride in your homeland, no pride in your language, nothing. Where does patriotism come into it? Patriots laugh at funny teeth or glasses or a 40-year-old acting as a student? Hey, those were great characters. Humoud, Mehemeed, Assaad and Fouad… Fouad? Are you for real? You realize he's the most racist character on TV? -Where's the racism, man? -Yeah, we all talk like that in Jeddah. Don't blame your ignorance of different accents in the Kingdom on comedy exaggerations. What ignorance! You can't see anything straight. -Don't keep saying… -You're acting like… Enough! For God's sake! You love Tash and want to make single stories and segments. What you hate about Tash is its comedy. But Tash made some horror episodes. Hossam, tell him about your film script. -God damn you, are you stupid? -What film? -I told you that's a secret between us. -Just tell him. No, I won't! This is just between us. Hossam! Either you tell me your film idea, or lose your five participation grades. There is no script. Or anything. It's just a story. A Jinn story, with murders. Like serial-killer films. But with Jinn. It's still early. It's impossible to shoot a film. -One hell of an idea. -I told him it was. I know so many Jinn stories. This man went to pray alone in the desert. He was praying, then he heard ten people behind him, saying, "Amen." You know guys, Tash Ma Tash wrote outstanding horror stories. But they don't have your visual effects skills. Or the guy who prayed in an abandoned mosque and while he's finishing his prayers, to his right he finds his dead friend, and to the left, his friend who he killed for money. Wow, I swear, it's an amazing idea. Hossam, listen to me. Give it a shot. We can shoot a simple video, upload it to YouTube and test people's reactions. That's it. You'll think I'm exaggerating when I call it the most important moment in my life. But you know what? Why not? Just let me exaggerate a little. There's no better student than you, Hossam. Hossam, you're so artistic. No one has better ideas than Hossam. Hossam! I'm talking to you. Are you deaf? -I've been calling you. -Sorry, Dad, I didn't hear you. Turn down the heat to 4 for me. Father. Do you think I can work… in editing and directing movies after I graduate? I always tell you, habibi, if you focus and persist, you'll reach what you wish. There's no directing happening. If you focus on studying instead of fooling around, you'll get straight As. Study and get straight As. Take your brother Magdy as an example. He focused and became a doctor. But I'm not like Magdy, Dad. His ambition's different. Shush. Second half's starting. The first pillar of Islam is for the believer to testify, "There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger and the last of the prophets and messengers." Prayer. Prayer is an invocation between man and his God… Orabi the undertaker is pursuing us. Strange times. Honestly, I thought he was harassing us, but it turned out all he really wants is to act. Every Muslim is supposed to pray five times. I see it as an opportunity that presented itself to us. We can use him. I swear, Sir, I laughed so hard when I saw you in With Yourself. Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. The four… The third pillar is almsgiving. Good work, champ. The views are enormous. Thanks, Bakri. You made the undertaker a comedian. You're such an artist. Keep it up. The fourth pillar is fasting during Ramadan. We're coming down the Mecca Highway, minding our own business, Honestly, do you think he's good? -Who? -My ass. I mean Orabi. …Hajj to the house of God. I think we can be optimistic. It's like he's not like other grown-ups. He's like us, but old school. I am prayers. If you fail at prayers, you fail in everything you do. Yo, student director. I think the car's parked wrong. Shall I move it back a little bit? There's no need. Keep it where it is, exactly angled with the sun. Yes, so it appears in the scene. I wanted to move it so you can see it. It won't appear and nor will you. It's a silhouette shot. Yes, a silhouette is when the sun hits your camera and burns it out. No, a silhouette is when you have a video with noise and grainy color, like footage from an old phone. Guys, the most important thing is that we don't kill anyone in the scene. Hossam, are you done? We want to see. Still some edits left to do. My heart's been racing since fourth period. What's wrong with this car? I swear to God, you're an artist. Let's focus on the creativity. There's still music to be added. We're on fire, I swear to God. Guys, if we work together, we can make something incredible. We could even win awards. That's true, Hossam. If it was just you and me, we would've spent two days on that scene. -Shut up, Ma'an. -Don't deny it. We're a team. Calm down! Calm down, guys. Guys, this was the best Saudi project I have ever seen. If we kept on at this rate every day, we'd have a whole film by the end of the year. Hey, student director, I told you from the start. I'm all yours. I'm also all yours. And I've always been yours, bro. What do you think? You did more than enough. Our film's story is one of simple events and profound meanings. Our focus will be on symbolism and subtext. We won't be making a horror film. We'll be making a nightmare. You'll sleep with the lights on. Another angle would reduce shooting time. Look, the technical stuff is on you. Leave everything else to me, OK? Our story's adapted from a terrifying book. The Book of Sun. A guy gets hold of the book, reads it and hell's doors are opened. A Jinn threatens that if he won't love her back she'll kill all his friends at a chalet. The mood is unpredictable. Jump scares, killings, blood… Our film will be loaded. Which takes us to our next location: the school. There's no money at all, so we need to use every free thing available. I provide the camera and equipment. Orabi has the money and the car. Ma'an and Ibrahim give their time and effort. Yes, champ… Turn around. An assignment: I want each of you to tell me your favorite film. We'll see how we can use it in our film. Al Nemr wa Al Ontha: a film focusing on drugs and action, but its real essence is humanity and family. Our film needs to be exactly the same. Fight Club is the greatest film for me, although we can't use the plot twist at the end. Having the protagonist turn out to be not real has become a cliché. 7 Playing Cards. The important thing is for the Jinn to be hot, like Ruby. The Cubs series. Cool friends who do everything, but in the end there's also a message. We only have three months to finish the movie. After that, we'll have exams. We must properly divide the time between studying and filming. I need complete seriousness and every ounce of your effort. We only have seven minutes of footage so far. To finish the film, we still need to shoot 100 more minutes. Good luck, boys. THE BOOK OF SUN FILM - 2010 Oh dear God, help me! I'll teach you foosball. He could build a car in less time than this. Orabi. He just gave us the… What's that? -You wanna know where Orabi is? -Yes. -What does that mean? -It means he ditched you guys. You're all I need. Are you for real? You're 45 minutes late! Move it, Orabi. The Book of Sun. Team's complaint to officer scene, take 1. Action, Orabi. Stop this obsession. There's no Jinn here. -Read some Qur'an-- -Cut! Orabi, dear. Please lose Fouad's character, for God's sake. -One more time. -Take 2. Stop this obsession-- Guys, the pants are on screen. Dear God, Orabi. Don't speak after the clapperboard. And they're not on screen, I tell you. I put the pants in the laundry and now I can't find them. -I can't find them at all. -Once again. Come on, Orabi. Just resist those satanic thoughts. There's no Jinn in-- Ibrahim, are you kidding me? Take 5. Who said it was a Jinn? Put out the cigarette, Orabi! What's with the investigator character? I told you this was a bad idea. It was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Find the actress. Hey guys. They're bringing in a girl. Ma'an's not picking up. -Come on. Again. -Take 14. Come on, Orabi. Action. Who said it's a Jinn? Just resist those satanic thoughts… Alright, bye. See you soon. Next week I'll… For God's sake, man! I've told you we're shooting! -What the hell do you want? -We want to shoot here! You keep interrupting. That's enough. You are taking so long, what do you want me to do? -That's enough, man. Let us shoot. -Calm down. Ma'an, you moron, where are you? Hello, brother Hossam. We're in place here since 6am. I'm well, thanks for asking. What? Ma'an, where's the actress? Hey, man, we're all set. Right here. We're right on schedule. As agreed. Sorry, the guys have other scenes to shoot outside. You're an hour late. -Your handwriting's impenetrable. -Where are you now? At school, dumbass! What? You took her to the school? I thought it was odd, but Orabi had us covered. Orabi's a teacher, not the Minister of Education. Girls aren't allowed in boys' schools. You'll get us in huge trouble. Are you an idiot? Do you have any brains at all? Is everything OK? Yeah. It's fine. But it would be better if you covered your hair. Mind your own business. Right. -Are you a child? -I'm not exactly on a date here. Listen, you dumbass. Listen and concentrate. Open the third drawer. -Done that. -Find some keys. -Most of them are small. -I'll look. There are pictures in here. -Oh dear God! -Look, isn't that the undertaker? What brought him here? -Focus! The key with the chain. -Hello, teacher. Oh, sorry. Should I say, hello officer? Found them. Lock yourselves in and don't leave the lab, either of you. I locked it. You just blow things out of proportion-- Oh dear God. -What's wrong, Ma'an? -Listen, I'll call you later. Ma'an, what happened? Hello there, Sir How about you join us for lunch? Orabi! The key! -That bastard Omar saw the girl. -Omar who? -Omar Darsy, he saw her in the lab. -Catch him, don't let him get away. Everything's fine, then… Bakri, congrats, you were accepted for the film. But I need you to catch Omar for me. My battery's dying. Orabi. Over here. Hide here. I haven't run in 15 years. Give me the camera. -What are you doing? -Ma'an can get it later. -Come on, let's move. -No, I can't, I can't. Move it! Please don't say a word. I'm so tired. Here they are. God damn you, you bastard! We have to stop him. What's this about? Omar will tell on us and our film. You go that way, I'll go this way, OK? Over here. Peace be upon you. Thank you. Are you blind? -Sorry! -God damn you. Hey, boy. Come here! -One minute, please. -Not right now, Ma'an. Sir, didn't you say that anyone who has an issue, no matter how personal, should express it? What's the issue, Ma'an? I'm… I'm… At night… I'm addicted to… It's an addiction. I'm an addict. The problem's masturbation. What should I do? I'm addicted to it. THE BLACK BALL -15 minutes of pool. -15 minutes of foosball. Everything's screwed. We'll have to drop those scenes. OK, fine. Let's just shoot all the scenes at my place. Don't take it that far, Orabi. Alright, listen… Let's chill here until Ibrahim comes. Once he's here, we can just forget about it. -What the hell? -You said, let no one in. -So you killed him? -Oh my God… I've been here for two hours and there's been no filming. -Are you planning something obscene? -No, I swear. This guy handles the money, the money for the acting. For the film, the Jinn film. It's a film with a message. Hello. And this one you hit is a producer… An assistant director. But it's OK. -That's enough. I'm leaving. -No, you can't. It's a boys school. -Bakri, tell her they're coming. -They are. And the money too. I don't want your 100 Riyals. OK, we can increase it. Right, Bakri? How much? -300 Riyals. -300 nothing! 700 might be possible. 700 it is. This is completely uncivilized, boys. They shall not pass. Hey, Mister. Are you afraid? Being civilized is throwing a book at me, Mr. Lieutenant? Fahd, beware of what I can do. Who's Fahd? I'm Salim, you idiot. Salim. You know what I can do to you. Especially as you're not in school. And you guys are out of school on a field trip? Tell me what you're doing here. No, Salem, stop. Don't! So? You brought your boy to play carom in our territory? Listen. Either you apologize to me in front of the boys, then buy me some meat pies and leave, or this black ball shop will turn red from your blood. Nice one, Salem! What's with the noise? -Hi, man. -Hi, Abu Mariam. How are you doing? What happened? You haven't raised your kids right, Abu Mariam. What? Gotcha. The boys don't know how to take a joke, Abu Mariam. No one taught you to host guests in your neighborhood? It's not like that. How is it, then? How is it? Who's the asshole who laid his hands on Ibrahim? Did he just say "asshole"? Each and every one of you punks is banned from the playground for a month. Now, move your asses out of here. Get going! You're one of a kind, Abu Mariam. Thanks. Mr. Orabi. Sorry I didn't show up to school today. I have a severe cough. That's fine, Saleh… Abu Mariam. And keep us in the loop on the physics questions, please. You'll have them. Ibrahim, please hurry up. OK, Hossam. Oh my God, Ma'an! Hand me my stuff, quickly. I can't see a thing. I can't see anything and we kept running. What's wrong with this car? Is she really beautiful, or is it just because we're in school? She's a hottie, but the desert we live in at school makes you crush on anyone. We've known for a while you're not quite straight. Where did you say you met her, Ma'an? Twitter. Let me look for that in the settings. If you'd just told me we'd be shooting with girls, I would've camped here since dawn. One more word and I'll shove my agal in your mouth. Wow, it's great. It even seems like a real film. -I wanted to carry on watching. -Really? But I can't return the 700. And I really need to go. I can't stand one more minute with you in this room. -Your stares disgust me. -Why? We're professionals. -We're not doing anything. -Why? If anyone bothers you, let me know. OK, guys, how can we sneak her out without anyone seeing her? Shit, if only we'd snuck her out 15 minutes ago. Everyone was busy praying. Guys, I have the solution. School's over, boys! Where are you going? What's happening? Hey, Sayari. Sayari, wait! No, it's a white Cressida, Sir. It's the school bus. God damn all of you! Come here. Sayari! What a horrible day. Really horrible. Nothing went right. How can we cut her when she's a main actress? Don't worry, it's alright. Ma'an says he did her face shots. Just a few back shots left, then we'll be done. Who told you it was a Jinn? Stop it with these old wives' tales. And recite some of the Qur'an to protect you. There's nobody here. That's impossible. It's 10 am. That's weird. Ibrahim, did you see something there? Ibrahim? Ibrahim? Man, that's some fine work. You're a champ, Hossam. I swear, I got goosebumps. Dinner is on me, guys I swear, that was such a scare, I reckon Bakri peed himself in there. Wait, guys, wait. You haven't seen anything yet. "Not everyone can become a great cook, but a great cook can come from anywhere." Ratatouille, 2007. Mr. Hossam, please. Hello Mr. Hossam. Did you really produce the best horror movies in the Arab world? My film's horror is very visual. It's for all audiences, not only Arabs. Did you decide which university to go to? I only have one answer for that. Write this down. Screw education. I'm going into film-making. Does this mean that all filmmakers should be ignorant? I was making this film while I was studying. Film-making doesn't need a certificate. Your movie is your image. Hossam! -Yeah… -No. Not good enough! Wake up and get yourself out of bed. You stay up until 3 am, as if there was no school, no future. You're 18 years old and I still need to wake you up like a child! Hey, Hossam, please put me in your film. Hook me up with that girl you brought to school. Please let me act with you, Hossam. Hossam Al-Khayat. Hossam. Mr. Mosleh wants to see you. Stand up, you insolent boy! Such recklessness and irresponsibility, shooting inside the school and such nonsense. If you won't behave, we will make you behave! Seriously, Mr. Orabi? Mr. Orabi has a point. This school is not your private property, boys. -Did he find out about the room? -No one saw it. …and shot in here. Now, you'll all sign a pledge. -And the girl? -Everything is ok. …no more shooting, whether inside or outside the school. Come on, come and sign it. Such insolence. Sign and get it over with. No one filmed in school, Sir. Where's the footage? You filthy animal. You look me in the eye and lie? More than one person told me. Sign it. But more than one said there was a girl in school yesterday. Will you believe anything? Challenging me, Khayat? And the rest of you? You can sign this pledge, or shall I call all your parents? Are these the kids who brought a camera to school? Yes. Ma'an Bangar. Our son, Ibrahim. Hossam Al-Khayat. Hossam, your brother Abdelmegid was an excellent student. You, however… You love to fool around. Anyway, since those boys have this passion for directing and shooting films, why don't we get them to direct the graduation film for this year? Instead of the cost of hiring an agency, we can give them grades. Mr. Maysara, these students are reckless and this won't end well. They need to be whipped! No, it sounds like a good idea. No, Sir. I'm sorry. It's not your choice. Not since you brought disgrace to the committee. That's why we banned you. You've signed those pledges, so if there is to be some shooting, it will only happen in my presence. Way to go, Mr. Mosleh. God damn that filthy Mosleh. He's against shooting here until he finds a free service. Then his greed takes over. And then it's, "Any shooting only happens through me." So now it's subject to censorship. The man's a scoundrel. -Venal. -Venal animal. -Relevance? -Money. -Or the other one. -That's possible. I do believe Orabi. -"I believe if the boys have…" -Money. No one ever says no to money. Listen. I think we should stop now and continue after the vacation. No way. We'd miss the deadline for the Dubai Film Festival. And we rented the chalet where we'll be shooting. We're being watched. And you guys have exams. We can't do it. Ma'an and I have shot at school for a long time with no one noticing. -What about the graduation film? -There you go. There you go. I'll handle it. Me. I learned the basics from Hossam. It won't be that hard to work on. -No Jinn transformations and so on. -You're my man Ma'an. See how the team's growing? Bakri, Omar and the boys. And Orabi. Leave physics-teacher Orabi outside. We want Orabi the artist. You just need to help us work secretly. All the real work is in the chalet. I'm in. To hell with the school and the teachers. When the film's a hit, we'll be rich and famous. No doubt about it. I'll help with 100 subscriptions. But "to hell with the teachers"? I don't mean you. It's more of a general idea. You repeated it more than once. I'm a big-mouth, man. COMING SOON ON YOUTUBE Don't bother me, you and your friend. It's all in your head. You're delusional. Where's your fear of God, man? Jinn are in the Qur'an. Thank God. Bless you! Call Officer Orabi. He who's not ready for The Book of Sun, shouldn't have opened it. From now on, you'll hear the call to prayer backward. What do we have to do with black magic, bro? How stupid are you? Ibrahim, let's not split-up now. This is what she'd want us to do. THE BOOK OF SUN No! THE BOOK OF SUN DIRECTED BY HOSSAM AL-KHAYAT I swear, you're really talented, Hossam. For real, thank you. Talented? For God's sake. If he didn't waste time fooling around, he could've had a chance to get into medical school. This is too salty. Maybe he doesn't want to go to medical school. I really understand, Hossam, these effects we see in a few minutes take a lot of time and effort. -Thank you, Magdy. -No, for real. Listen, Hossam, when I was your age, I used to love football. You know, I once hoped to play professionally. -Do you remember? -And even now… Nothing stops me playing football every Wednesday with the guys. But I never allowed my hobby to interrupt my life. Hossam, you really need to secure a real job. Know what you're owed and what you owe. After that, no one can stop you from filming, champ! Take your dirty hand off. God bless you, Magdy. So level-headed. -Are the potatoes too hot? -I told you, it's too salty. Please don't just talk nonsense. A talented player's job is being a football player. Not playing a game once a week and you think you're talented. Don't speak to your brother like that. Mother, it's his future. Let him speak. Magdy, enough bullshit. You see the crap on TV every Ramadan. You know what I do is special. Think about your future. You need a real job. What if YouTube shuts down. What would you do? You're not in Hollywood. This is Saudi Arabia. You'd end up maybe an events photographer. No, there's Telfaz, there's Uturn, plenty of companies I could work for. Or can I only call it a job if I hate it? I just want to do what I love. Life has more to offer than work, marriage and food. There's more to life than that. Good luck. Enough! You've nagged me to death! I don't want to do anything. That's enough! If I love it, does it mean I'll be successful at it? Why doesn't anyone believe in me? I fear I'm going to wake up and find everything I've built is worthless, that I'm gambling with my future and I'll lose. The future isn't a single choice, Hossam. The future is something you shape. Fear will just make you freeze up. You'll never be able to move. Keep your eyes on your papers. Do you really think I'm happy being a jerk to the students? I'm being a jerk because I'm afraid the students will humiliate me. The undertaker is afraid. You know, my first year of work, I wanted to be the kind teacher who helps students with their dreams. And then, my first year of teaching, a student threw a shoe at me. Shit! You need to follow the herd, or else you'll be doomed. Who's up there? Stop! This is the fourth or fifth time. -What happened? -I'm sorry. He's forgotten his book again. -What is it with your generation? -Such a bad student, Mr. Mosleh. -I won't do it again. -I'll handle him. Come on, move it. There's something that makes you special. You know for sure what you want. That's a blessing in itself. You're learning on your own. I'm scared of failing my exams. And I don't care about the grades. I'm afraid to disappoint my mom, to not be the boy she wished for. That's it? What if I told you I'll cover that for you? -Are you for real? -If I did, would it ease your heart? -Of course! -So stop worrying. I got it covered. Our student director. Come on. Come on, our student director. Our student director. Hop in. Look, we'll slaughter them! LOCATION PLAN -CHALET See? I surprised you. I am surprised. What's this shithole? What, bro? -It's spacious. Look how big it is. -Spacious? I need rooms. We have an interrogation, a crime, indoor scenes. How the hell can I use an open space? Well, there's grass. You can… Omar, did you write it on the slate? 25. -Right, take 1. Ready, Orabi? -Yes. Take the glasses off. Daghrir, Sir, this is the scene where the officer interrogates you. Yes, I… You know what's happening, but no one believes you. I have a film idea for you. It's about drugs and the devastation of the youth, I was jailed once, for reckless driving, and this guy who killed his mother by driving recklessly, speeding and… Yes, Daghrir, Sir, but we have a story about a Jinn that loves a human. -Did you read the script? -Yes, I read the hell out of it. -So, you understand… -I do. Ok. Listen man, he doesn't read. I'm telling you, he can't read. The Book the Sun. Scene 25, take 1. Daghrir. Tell me about this Jinn in the chalet. The chalet… the chalet is… you know, there's a… there's a… The chalet is haunted. They say there's Jinn. You hear voices, you feel someone's touching you, but there's no one there. You hear whispering, but again, there's no one there. I swear Orabi, it's haunted. You know, Orabi, haunting is-- Great performance, but don't call me "Orabi". Right? Call me "Officer". So, you're an officer? It's OK, Orabi, I'll fix it in post. Shame on you. This is your teacher. How can you talk to him like that? You have no shame? Enough, we're not in school. We're all one team. I swear, I love you boys and I always pray for you in my heart and I wish you happiness, but you need to come together and stick together. I always pray for you day and night. Even you, you're the best amongst them. May God bless you. I wish you happiness. This guy comes to me every day, may God bless him. -Firecrackers. -You're such a beauty. Firecrackers. How can I tell you how much I love you? There's nothing more than love. The Book of Sun. Scene 30, take 1. One moment, please. Why would Ma'an slap me? Bakri, we agreed on this. Your character doesn't believe that Ibrahim died. Ma'an slaps you out of it. I knew no one read the script. That's not how I see it. My character's wiser than his. I should slap him, because Ma'an is so stupid. -That doesn't work. -He talks so much. Bakri, please don't ruin it. Stop now, or I'll slap your ass. How many times did I ask you about mounting the camera on the fan? That's why I brought an electrician to hang the chandelier. Who's talking about the chandelier? I'm talking about the fan! And how would I know? It's fine, it's done, we did it. Oh dear God! We spoke about this ages ago, bro. Hang it on a hook. Would that work? You have soft hands. God bless you. Soft as silk. Listen, guys. I'm outta here. -What the hell, Bakri why? -Let him go. He's a narcissist. -Shut up. -His phone wallpaper is his own picture. God damn you! Don't be so sensitive, bro. I just ask you for stuff. Ma'an, what are you doing up there? Get down Ma'an, don't be crazy! Come down, man. Come on, Ma'an. Don't untie anything. This rope will fix everything. Oh God! My arm! You're stupid to have gone up. Are you OK? Listen, guys. I'm outta here. Let him go. He's a narcissist. Hey. Can't we rent the chalet for just two more days? There's no money. We need to hand in the key tomorrow after Isha'a prayers. Let's make the most of the chalet. We'll call the gang and have some fun. You idiot, who jumps in like that? At least he's not like the one who refuses to swim. -This is all your fault, you child! -I've put up with you for too long. You're so selfish. Who do you think you are? You're the school idiot. -Slap him. -Damn it. Calm down, guys. Not here. Just think for a while. -Why won't you hear me out? -Let go or I'll break your other arm. -Try it, macho. -That's enough, guys! You started the whole thing. This is all on you. If you didn't-- What's happening? That's it, Bakri. It's midnight. That worked like a charm! Oh yes. Cut! Thanks, guys, for being with us in the best scene in The Book of Sun. Hossam! I haven't missed Friday prayers lately. Cut me some slack this week. Friday? It's Saturday. And pick-up your phone. It's been ringing for an hour. You finally picked up. Open the door, man. I'm outside. -What's up? -Open the door. Hurry up. Why the rush, bro? We would've met at school in an hour anyways. Hello, everyone. Damn, man! You woke me up this early to show me this show? OK? Let's get started. -We received a video… -Do you know what time it is? It's a horror movie made by a bunch of children or something. Don't bother me, you and your friend. It's all in your head. You're delusional. The cheap effects look like they're from the 60s. The directors who first used these effects are all dead. They're using them now. And don't the people in the film have voices to scream with? They have girls' voices. Why? The whole point of the trailer is to motivate you to watch the film. This trailer did the opposite. It's saying, "Don't watch." There's this guy with a gown. I'm telling you, he takes all the terrible roles. One time he's an officer. Then he's a monster again. We can see how big you are. It's obvious. The only Saudi horror film nominated for a bunch of awards. Oh God, how miserable. You're still playing an officer ever since Tash. -Even hypermarkets give prizes now. -What are you doing with these kids? The number's too long! That's an IBAN, not a phone number! Nominated for what exactly? Bless you! Laugh, Muhammad. -This trailer… -…is boring. Come on, laugh. -The second-worst thing I've ever seen. -The man's a comedian. The worst thing will be the film when it screens. What is the monster doing to you? Based on your scream, it looks like the monster broke more than your hand. Shame on you. Don't make this film. If you've already shot it, delete it. Have mercy on us. Please don't upload this garbage. Look who it is. Chill out, Tom Cruise. You can't act at all, can you? I swear to God, if I'm in this film, I will mess you up. Got me? Get out of here! -We'll go to another school. -Other school kids don't watch YouTube? We'll be like those boys they caught fooling around in the bathroom. For God's sake, shut up and let me think. What's to think about? Our lives are ruined! Damn it. We can't live here. We need to move. Or be home-schooled. -We can emigrate. Leave Saudi Arabia. -Enough, bro. I told you, enough! -Omar, did you see what's happening? -Sorry, Hossam, I have a math exam. Look, he's the first to turn against us. Ibrahim will be the next. And Orabi. Orabi will fail us. Shit. Orabi. It's the same guy who appears in all the scenes. All the crappy scenes. Then he laughs in the end. Are we still doing this laughing villain thing? This guy can eat my shoe. Who cares about Badr Saleh? We're making a great horror film, son. Thank God, we've rented the chalet and that's it. We have scenes 13 and 27 left to shoot. Hey, Sir. No one will agree to act with us. Tons of people from outside the school want to act with us. The video has a million views in less than a day. -God damn you, Badr Saleh. -It doesn't matter, bro. The film will win awards and this Badr will come to us… Orabi, are you in a coma? The situation is crap. No one will want to act with you. Boys, I know it's a setback. Lots of people will attack us along this long road. Badr Saleh won't be the last one. Our team has something special. We help each other. We don't fail, or stop filming. There is no film! There's no film. If you want to help us, get us the exam questions. -What about exam questions? -Get us the questions, so we can study. Hossam, can we talk about this later? -Stop stalling. -I don't have the exam! OK? What does that mean? You promised us. Hossam, don't be an idiot. Where would he get them from? I didn't promise anyone. You asked me for help. I helped you with your future. -Who are you to control my future? -I get what you're going through. -You just want them because-- -You don't have that right. You have some leisure time that you spent with us. Calm down. You each promised the other something you can't do. For God's sake, Hossam, how can you study for the exams? You've cut so many classes. Smartass! If I hadn't said what I said, you wouldn't have continued the film. Don't ever mention the damn film again! What the hell is wrong with you? Are you crazy? Are you? I didn't mean--- How dare you raise your hand to a teacher? So what? You're like a slave to the school. Damn school and its crappy mentalities that try to shut us up. It's not your fault. It's the fault of the moron who hasn't learned his lesson. None of you are real men, starting with the liar Orabi. If I didn't give you cigarettes, we wouldn't have seen your face here. Bakri and Omar betrayed us. And Ma'an? He only knows kissing ass. And going along with the crowd. So this is your hangout. Left your classes to fool around? I swear, I am ashamed. I apologize. And as for my son Hossam, I will handle him. Hossam, son, you will not disappoint Mr. Mosleh again. Or else, I swear, next time I'll beat the hell out of you. Do you hear me, Hossam? You're a child who doesn't know what responsibility means. Your mother and I are very disappointed. You've embarrassed us in front of the whole school. Good evening or good morning, depending on when you're watching this. I apologize on behalf of the art society for continuing our film The Book of Sun that we promised you would see by the end of this year. Working on the film was exhausting for the great team behind it. We expected that the results of this effort would be clear to us by screening the film. But unfortunately, the reaction of the majority of people made us reconsider. We decided that we should devote our efforts to projects that further everyone's goals. Listen, man, you haven't seen a thing. You only saw bits and pieces. I was there. We expected that the result of this effort would be clear to us by screening the film-- What result, Gown Man? What result? What the hell, man? -And don't forget… -See? The bastard sold us out. I swear, I won't let it go. -Did Hossam see the segment? -His mother cut off his internet. Good. Listen, I have a plan to get the hard disk from the deputy's office. I saw it in a great movie. We get a bar of soap and Mr. Mosleh's key. We heat it and press it into the soap, then return it. At the end of school day, we get some candle wax. We take the wax and melt it into the soap mold. That way, we have a key. We remove it slowly, so it doesn't break, then we come to school after dark, into the deputy's office-- -The computer! -Get running. Damn, man. Ma'an, I told your mom. You can't see him until after the exams. Yes, we know, but we brought a private tutor along. Hello, auntie. We all chipped in for Mr. Abdelrahman to help us study for the exams. Didn't Hossam say? No, he didn't tell me. OK, come on in. Your friends aren't children, you know. Thank you. Hossam, it's not fair to lose everything we've done. How could you stand to see it get thrown away? The festival ends this week, so it's hopeless anyways. Screw the festival. The film's for us, not for them. You still don't get it? We're a joke in Jeddah. Check out #BookOfSun. Everyone's saying it's garbage. You want them to kiss your ass? You make fun of Tash Ma Tash. It's a whole lot better than your work. And the film is for people like us. Not everyone will like it. Sure, everyone using the hashtag and at school are haters. They all hate us. Just stop tooting your own horns. We did our best. It didn't work out. It's an embarrassment, and I failed. To hell with your selfishness. You only think of yourself. And this "garbage" you don't like, it's your film alone, it's our film and our voice and we don't need anyone to like it. We can put it on YouTube, put it in the festival, screen it in an alley, if we want to. You know what? We did our part. The ball's in your court now. Hossam, are you done studying? Still have some stuff left. Bless you, habibi. When you're done, I've made you an egg sandwich. Sure, Mom. He's crazy. Let's go. Don't be afraid, as long as faith is in your heart and the Qur'an is in your hands. Don't fear a thing. Nothing can hurt you. Thank you, guys, for all the time and effort you spent. I can't begin to say how sorry I am. No, begin by saying you're sorry. And you're not a real man. Sure, Ma'an, sure. I'm sorry. And I am not a real man. And whatever you need, I'm all yours. Over my dead body. No need, bro. I know what you went through and I feel for you, too. -Habibi. -Don't worry. God damn you! Idiot! Peace and Allah's mercy be upon you. Peace and Allah's mercy be upon you. During the last few days, some confiscated items were stolen from my office by a group of students, or one student. The three students who signed pledges not to film again inside the school will be the main suspects if these items aren't returned and they will be banned from attending final exams. Anyone who tries to collude with them will suffer the same. As for the teachers -who participated in the work… -We'll finish Electromagnetic induction. God willing, Badr Saleh won't make fun of us. …will be fired if these items are not returned. And I swear to God, if I hear of someone filming on the school premises, I swear in His holy name he'll wake up the next day and find his school file right next to him, and just try finding another school. We make a copy of the hard disk, then we return the stuff. We upload the film after we graduate and we give Mosleh the finger. But Orabi will still be here and he'll take the fall alone. We need to find a solution that will save all of us. You know… If you need something from a dog, call it "Sir." Mr. Mosleh, we're sorry for filming in school without permission. We were wrong. You could suspend us and make an example out of us. Or adopt the project, like the football team or the graduation project, which we did for free, just to prove how much we care about this place. Don't deprive us of our education for a project you could be proud of. Should I enlarge his name? I think he's a narcissist. He'd want his name to be visible. Orabi! -When can I see it? -We're in the final stages. A few edits and we're done. Cut! -Finish it and come back. -God bless you, Sir. Thank you. -Next time, knock before you enter. -As you wish. Because we're on the right track and only time will… will prove that what we say and do is correct. I started strong and then I remained steady… What a liar. Such a huge hypocrite. He just likes to kiss ass. -Congrats. -Thank you. Look, Mosleh's at that table. Get the box and take it to him now. Didn't we agree to do it after the party? He looks in a good mood and people are greeting him. -Let's go. -Sure. I have to endure the circumstances, even if they are against me and my conviction. Otherwise I will not be able to bear them. Starting with the school principal and the activities office. I was destined to be a part of this great school's history. What's up? We called you a million times. And we came to your house. You never picked up. Gown Man. Great that you made it. Listen. I am so sorry. I felt like a fool. There was so much and I wasn't thinking straight. I want you to know how sorry I am. How were your final exams? I did well, thank God. I got good grades. But that's not why I'm apologizing. I want you to know you were the best thing that happened to us this year, especially to me. Your support was the best. And I want to apologize to you, too. I used my authority to control your future and I shouldn't have done such a thing. Why are you talking all formally like that? You want me to get you a stick to beat me until you feel better? Orabi, you must know what we did was the best thing about this year. And you know what? We finished the film. For real? I wish you luck. We worked extremely hard. We sure needed you with us. But we made it eventually, removed scenes and cut down the story. We made it 45 minutes. It's not a feature film, of course, but it could get accepted by some festivals. The full film is in here. As you wish. I'll leave it here for you. I know you're just as invested in it as I am. Back in a minute. I'm not really interested. Excellent. I think he's downstairs, having a smoke. -Mr. Mosleh. -Hello. Hello, I hope you're well and enjoying the night. You're very polite today. Mr. Mosleh, this is the final version of the film. We have it here for you and would love your feedback. Beautiful. The box is nice too. Thank you, guys. -You worked hard, huh? -Yes, Sir. You deserve the best. -Great, is everything here? -Yes, that's the final version. It's a special thank you for… -Everything's in here? -Yes, the film's done. Special edition-- What's wrong? You bastards. None of you can steal from me and use me. Get it? If everything's here, then keep the computer for yourselves. No, Mr. Mosleh, for God's sake. Pledges didn't work, nor did threats. You scumbags belong in the streets. Have your daddy come cry to me tomorrow. The situation's out of my hands. It's the ministry's call. Enjoy the open buffet tonight. You'll graduate next year. I swear, this bastard wants money. Hossam. Hey, guys. We've been looking for you for ages. Peace be upon you and congratulations on your graduation, my dear students. Congrats to all the parents on the graduation of this amazing… Hossam! …that will be a pioneer in success, God willing. What happened? Boy! We present this video to you, made under my own supervision, by some of the students in this school where we tried to improve their education as much as we could. -They're about to play The Book of Sun. -They're about to play The Book of Sun. The Book of Sun? The graduation film? A film produced by the school under his supervision. …We made the school proud and the result was… Orabi. The flash drive. -What's happening? -Don't worry about it. Dear student, I advise you to become a hard worker and join us on the merit board. Mohamed. The projector isn't working. There's a huge problem. There's no sound, the cable isn't… Just move. OK. -I still don't understand. -How stupid can you be? Ma'an, Mosleh said the graduation film was supervised by him. No one knows about that graduation film, get it? He doesn't know we filmed him saying it was produced and supervised by him. It means we have evidence against him and his fate is tied to ours. So we'll play that instead. -What a lowlife. -And venal. Ali Sayari, football. Good job. THE BOOK OF SUN Supervised by Mr. Mosleh Alsowaidi Khayat! Mr. Mosleh. We just need a minute, don't be too hasty. Slow down. Take your time. Get off me, God damn you. To the swimming pool directly. Listen to me, this chalet is haunted. You'll see things. You'll hear voices, things passing by and… No, there's nothing. Stop raving. I'm not raving. I'm telling you, I hear voices. And I see shapes. Listen to me. -Where? I can't see anything. -You can't see now. But they'll haunt you soon. Well done. Good job. Oh dear God, forgive us. Dear God, who's that? Oh God! Oh merciful God. Oh God, have mercy. Oh God. Merciful God! My heart! I can't breathe. You haven't seen the best. There's a lot of stupid stuff. Why didn't you show me this right from the start? I did, you jerk, I sent a broadcast. But you're as dumb as your old phone. Ma'an, stop this film, you bastard! -Mr. Mosleh's voice. -Ma'an, you stop this film! -I can't hear you. -Stop this film, Ma'an! What film? Damn this callowness. Stop the film. One minute, Sir. Is this how you repay my trust? -It's unplugged. -I know it's unplugged. -You won't ruin me. -You're like a dad to us. Would you do this to your dad, you ingrate? Guys. We apologize for the technical glitch. You want to see The Book of Sun? -Do you want to see it? -Yes! Guys, if you can't shout louder, it will never work. -Do you want to see it? -Yes! -I can't hear you. Do you want to see it? -Yes! Play the film! Play it! Play it! Play the graduation film now. Ma'an, don't you understand? When Mr. Mosleh asks you, you just say yes and do it. -That's not even an option. -You hear that? This is it. Are you retarded? Your parents should've gotten you into a special needs school. But because they're poor, you're here. Are you threatening me, you piece of garbage? God forbid, there's no threatening. I'll only do what you command. I'll put this cigarette out on your… Oh, no. -Seems this is not it. -No, this is not it. Maybe this one. I swear I should come into your classes and piss on you one by one. -This is completely inappropriate, Sir. -Not fitting for a role model. It seems we can't play this graduation project, as you can see. Play it! Allah, I take refuge with you from all evil and evil-doers. What do you want? I want you to love me, like I love you. It can't happen. Let me go, please. I want your heart to melt with mine. It won't work. Humans and Jinn don't match together, woman. Through The Book of Sun, the book you opened. If you don't give my heart a chance, I will rip out the hearts of all your loved ones and kill them. No! What's wrong, Ma'an? Nothing, there's nothing. Alright, we're going on a school trip to the chalet. We need discipline, and those who don't have it should come to the alley and join Abu Mariam's team to learn it. -Sir? -Yes? I'm warning you, you can't go… No, Mr. Mosleh, you just tell me what you want and I'll play it for you. -I'm the DJ for the night. -Give me the laptop, Ibrahim. -Shall I put it in a nice box for you? -Give it to me, you bastard! -What's happening here? -Come and see this nonsense. The people outside are graduating… I don't care if they graduate or not. This horror film was shot in the school without permission, under our noses. We asked them to work on it. I was there. No, that's how they used us, those sons of bitches. Hey, Mosleh, calm down. These bastards have filmed me and they're threatening me and the administration. How can you allow anyone to threaten us? It seems what we heard was true and the Jinn is real. See, I told you from the start. Let me take her out with my rifle. No, no. We have to go by the station, so I can get my coffee first. Why coffee? Not coffee. I mean the IDs. What do IDs have to do with the Jinn? Not IDs. I mean this… What do they call it? The ammunition to fight the Jinn and blow her up with all the bullets. Where has Officer Orabi disappeared to? He's been gone for a long time. Listen, do you smell something rotten? What's that? Blood! -How did we get back here? -I don't know what's happening. Bakri, calm down. Have faith in your heart. Oh God, I'm going crazy. -No, Bakri. -I'm going crazy. Bakri, calm down. -I am going crazy. -I said, calm down. That's not me, I swear it's not. I never did that. They edited it. What's wrong with you? It's not me, man. What's wrong with you? I swear they photoshopped it. I should pee all over you, then go to this hypocrite. The bastard's so stingy with us, we don't even have real coffee. Call the police to arrest them for this blackmail. This is blackmail. They're trying to destroy me. And the thing we've been building for thirty years. Mosleh, that's enough! It's a student graduation party. In a month, you won't see them again. -They've learned nothing in 12 years. -Listen to me. Am I wrong for relying way too much on you, Mosleh? Last year was the bribery scandal. This year a video scandal. Enough! Venal. I was right. Anyways. Play the film, guys. It's over. Tomorrow morning you come to my office. And you guys and anyone who worked in this film. And put out the cigarette. This is a non-smoking hotel. Hey, lady. Let us go. Undo your evil. I told you, give me a chance! Don't listen to her, Ma'an. Enough, I don't want you. I don't want you. -It's not fair. Have mercy. -Don't you get it? -It's not fair! -What do you want from us? I told you I wanted love. I wanted us to fall for each other. You didn't listen. -The make-up could've been so much-- -Wait, wait. What are you? I tried but we can't stay together. -Untie us. -I told you to shut up! God damn you! What have you done? -Are you crazy or what? -Go on. Give him the Qur'an. I can't see. I can't see. Torch her, Ma'an. Recite it by heart. -Recite it by heart, Ma'an. -"I seek refuge in the Lord from the evil which He created, from the evil of intense darkness, from the evil of malignant witchcraft and from the evil of envy." "I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the God of mankind, from the evil of the sneaking whisperer, who whispered in the hearts of mankind, of the jinn and of mankind." Get to hell! Die, Die. It doesn't matter what happens It doesn't have to work Reality has come to show you Your dream needs a change You're not the only one For the first time, I understood Abdelrab Edris' words: "One night. If only one was left." It's our film and our story. Whatever its flaws and fiascos, we produced our film. You will grow old, you will forget And you will hear the same story You will grow old, you will forget If you think that death is far from you Our voice was strong. It shook the hall room, it shook the entire hotel. I swear what we did was unbelievable, the four of us. Except for Ma'an here… Ma'an was fooling around, acting like the broken-arm boy. You had one hell of a fall. I swear, you missed out. Mosleh came to us and told us to turn off the film. And Mr. Maysara told him to get out and stop his nonsense. I've always seen school as a jail. Each student is sentenced to 11 years. And the last year is hard labor. But I can't imagine serving my sentence at school in any better way. You will grow old, you will forget And you will tell the same story You will grow old, you will forget Mr. Maysara made it clear to us that the film must never be screened. It's negative publicity for the school and it would jeopardize Orabi's job. Why would we even screen it? Have you seen it? It's a crappy film. I don't know how we thought it would succeed. …The suffering, the saga… Hear me out, bro. Listen to me when I talk. Nowadays, the only place you'll find The Book of Sun is Baljoon, on the city's South Road. Abu Rayesh and The Book of Sun. You'll shut down one day, Saleh. Everyone will have DSL at home. -Isn't he in The Book of Sun? -No, he's just a jerk. As for the vacation, it was the worst summer I've ever spent. You remember at the party, I told Orabi I did well in the finals? It was all a lie. The truth is, I didn't do well at all. So, I lost everything. I didn't make a great film I could share with the world, nor did I get a good grade to go to university. Do you think if I could go back in time, would I choose not to work on the film? -Thank god it's not in my power. -Hossam, why don't you get up? I made you an egg sandwich. I know what you're thinking. That she was right. It's what I'm thinking, too. But don't worry. There's a place for failed filmmakers, and it isn't so bad. In the advertising field a high school certificate won't get you anywhere. But being an experienced AfterEffects designer can easily get you an internship. I hope you like it. What's this? -It's your yogurt. -That's not what we agreed on. I'm kidding, man, that's private work. I just put the yogurt in it as a joke. Come on, man. Show me. This is the real thing. STRAWBERRY FLAVOR BLUEBERRY FLAVOR Excellent. Just one more favour-- You've done that too? God bless you, thank you. Pleasure to help you. Bye. Imagine that. I get paid 3,000 Riyals a month. Hossam! I asked you for two cola designs, cherry and lemon. -You asked for two? -Yes. How many did you think? First thing tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning. So, where's the problem? I can start fresh, I have everything I need here. A really excellent computer worth more than The Book of Sun's entire budget. A very cool break room with a foosball table and a PlayStation. Almost everything I need to brainstorm and come up with ideas. Hossam. Hello, Inas. -Can I give you some advice? -Of course, go ahead. You're new here. Don't let them abuse you. Leave at 6 p.m., whether you have work left to do or not. It's OK, there's no problem. We're all one team in the end. Alright, when you find yourself working 10 hours a day, don't say no one warned you. OK, thank you, Inas. But who are we kidding? The problem is clear. The problem is I suck at advertising. Because that's not what I want to do in my life. Yajooj and Majooj. Scene 3, take 1. My heart's been pounding all week. -You're late, director. -Come. Well, the color correction isn't right. Now you know about coloring. -And the make-up. The reflection shows. -There's nothing wrong with it. Focus. Wow! -I swear I wanna kiss you. -Firecrackers. It's like "Scorsceceste." I'd give you every pack of smokes back. Remember when we were kids, I told you, you don't belong here. -Habibi. -When is the next shooting…
