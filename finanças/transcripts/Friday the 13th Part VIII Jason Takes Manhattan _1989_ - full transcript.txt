23.976 English SDH RETAiL sync ? 19.06.2020 (Echoing) Jason... (Man on radio) It's like this. We live in claustrophobia, a land of steel and concrete, trapped by dark waters. There is no escape, nor do we want it. We've come to thrive on it and each other. You can't get the adrenaline pumping without the terror. I love this town. ? Fallen angels take to the street ? It's an empty dance ? And so incomplete ? Their hollow voices whisper the cry ? Further down the line there's a reason why ? You've tried before but you can't buy a clue... ? (Police siren wails ) ? No matter what you do ? The darkest side of the night ? Burns like a fire ? For the wasted lives ? And there's no way you can fight ? Show some respect ? And try to survive ? On the darkest side ? Neon shadows that point the way ? Never lead you out ? It's a game we play ? The madness comes and the madness goes ? It's a simple world ? But it's all they know ? You try to fix it but there's nothing you can do ? You just gotta see it through ? The darkest side of the night ? Burns like a fire for the wasted lives ? And there's no way you can fight ? Just show some respect ? And try to survive ? On the darkest side... ? (Bird screeches ) You've been listening to WGAZ, the electricity of Manhattan. This request is going out to the senior class of Lakeview High... - That's us! - All right! They'll be graduating on the 13th and we wish them the best of luck and success when they come to visit our seductive city. Our lure is a great one, young friends, but beware - the city of lights casts many shadows indeed. - I love you. - I love you. (Moans ) (Giggles ) - Got to throw the anchor over. - OK. (Frogs croaking, boat creaking) - What's wrong? - Nothing. Come on, Jimmy, something's bothering you. We're near that summer camp where all those murders took place. - What murders? - You don't want to know. - Tell me. - Forget about it, Suzi. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake, if you believe the stories. What stories? There was this boy named Jason Voorhees. He drowned in Crystal Lake about 30 years ago. None of the counsellors heard him. Help! A bunch of years went by, everyone forgot about it - and then the murders started. - Jason did it? His mother blamed the counsellors for her son's death and she tried to kill them all but she got her head chopped off by one of them. (Jimmy) Legend has it that Jason came back to get even, vowing to kill every teenager in the area. And every now and then, the murders just start up! Forget about it, Suzi, they're just stories. (Electricity shorting) - (Bird screeches ) - Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Come on, I'm serious. All right, I'll go check it out. (Eerie echoing) - (Boat creaks ) - Jim? Jimmy? (Creaking) Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it. (Creaking) (Gasps ) (Screams ) Got you good, Suzi. All right, all right... so I'm a major ass. - You'll never do it again? - Never again. - Come on, forgive me? - No. (Suzi giggles ) (Moaning) (Echoing) Jason... (Suzi gasps ) Jason? (Gasping) (Bird screeches ) No. No, please, no! No, no! (Screaming) No! No! Toby's been awful quiet back there. Yeah, I guess he's a little nervous about the trip. Here. Go on, open it. Stephen King supposedly used it in high school. I don't know what to say. Rennie, you are the best student I have ever had. You have a real gift. If there's anybody that can make use of that pen, it's you. (Girls laughing and screaming) - Hello, Charles. - Colleen. This cruise was your idea so at the very least you could show up on time. - Has everyone checked in? - No. Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson never showed up and I'm very concerned. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York. That's nice. We're running five minutes late already. There's someone else coming, too. (Sighs ) You never should've brought her. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do. She doesn't know. She never had a stable life till she lived with me. She certainly doesn't have one now. I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else and I know what's best for her. End of discussion. No, I think it's just the beginning. (Man) Have you decided on departure protocol? I thought I'd leave that honour to my son. Dad, I don't think... Relinquishing command of the motor vessel Lazarus to Captain Sean Robertson. But before you take the helm, take this. Something old and something new. I used that sextant when I was your age. Now those goddamn computers do all the work for you. Have you decided on a plan, Captain? (Sean) OK... how about we start up the engines and come around 180 degrees? Aren't you forgetting something, mister? (Sean) Um... (Honking) Send out the international maritime signal, followed by a broadcast warning other ships that we are under way. This voyage is doomed. Tell me about it. (Honking) (Cheering and yelling) (All) All right! Bye! Bye! - Bye! - Bye! (? Soft rock) - Rennie. - Hi, Sean. I heard you weren't coming. We changed our minds. - I got you a present. - But I didn't get you one. Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway. Sean, I love it. I thought when we got there we could hike to the top of the statue, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 storeys tall. That sounds wonderful. Mr Robertson, your father was looking for you. I guess I'll see you later. What are you doing here? We've already been through all this. I'm sorry, Uncle Charles. Please don't be upset with me. I'm not upset, I'm just...concerned. (? Rock) (? Screaming guitar solo) Is this axe awesome or what? Too cool, JJ. Your parents really came through. No lie. I hear there's this big power room downstairs, we can get supreme concert hall echo. Come down and shoot a basement tape. I've got to get some shockumentary footage first. Don't tell me you're still trying to scam on Tamara? How long have we known each other? Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's only interested in what you can do for her. She is a user. - She's sexy. - So what? So's this guitar. Yeah. I'll talk to you later, all right? There's a big storm predicted for tonight. Honey, you're making a big mistake. It's not too late to put you back on shore. If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid... She didn't push me into this. Honey... why are you doing this to yourself? I don't even know what I'm afraid of. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it? Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it. I'm staying. OK. Man, this place is aching for a video! Wayne, you're an asshole. (? Heavy rock) ? I can't get your reaction from a magazine ? If there's no interaction, might as well give in ? You're givin' up You say you've had enough ? I gotta change your mind ? We're breakin' up... ? (Screaming) (Guitar feedback) (Screams ) What do you think? Time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds? I agree. (Child) Mommy? Help! Help me! (Whining) Help! Toby! (Yelps ) (Cheering) Is that a muscular bod or what? - (Laughs ) - (Grunts ) (Boy) One more! He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. He is so good-looking. Gorgeous guy at 10 o'clock. Look sensual. I think it's time for some recreational activity. Have you seen my niece? She's motorvating downstairs, what's the problem? Senior predictions has started and she hasn't shown up. Maybe some of us don't want our futures predicted. In your case, I'm sure that's true. Night-time is the right time. - No, thanks. - Don't be a lightweight. It's just... if we get caught, I could lose my science scholarship. You're talking to the prom queen. Would I risk getting caught? - Jesus! - Have you guys seen my dog? No, we haven't. Would you care for a hit? No, thanks. Real space cadet. Wonder if she'll nark on us? (Whistles ) Here, boy! (Whistles ) (Girl giggling) Yeah. Ready to party and then some. - What are you doing in here? - Nothing. Are you girls using drugs? Do you think I would use drugs, Mr McCulloch? We were just exploring the ship. I'll be coming to your room in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason. Have your biology project ready or I'll be phoning your parents. They're out of town. Oh. Well, uh... I'll make sure that you remain on board while your classmates are out seeing the sights. - Now what? - Relax. I've got McCulloch covered. That narking bitch niece of his is a different matter. Rumour has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water. (Soft footsteps ) Nice fight, Julius. I need to work on my left-right-left combo. (Sizzling) Listen, no hard feelings, OK? What do you say we track down those babes? (Breathes heavily) Julius? (Screaming) - So, are you having fun yet? - Yeah, a lot. Uh-huh. Come on, level with me. Hey. If you can't trust me, who can you trust? (Screams ) It was an accident, I swear. Stay calm and grab the life preserver! (Screams ) I've got you. Come on. - That was truly excellent. - Yeah. - Let's check out the waiters. - I think I'll pass. - What? - See you later. Some friend you are. Come on, grab her hand! It's OK. Sit down. - Grab her some towels, OK? - OK. She's fine, just go back to what you were doing. Care to talk about it? I can't swim. No kidding. Have you thought about taking lessons? It's not that simple. Good God! Take it easy, she's all right. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids. What happened? - It wasn't her fault. - Give me those towels. You stay away from her. Both of you! He's come back... and you're all gonna die. Just leave me alone! (Screams ) Help! Help me... (Echoing) Jason... (Knocking on door) The door's open. I'm in no mood for any more of your stall tactics. Where is your final project? Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles? Where did you get this? I packed it... just for us. That's it. You're not stepping off this ship until we return home. I haven't even shown you my biology project. Hey... What do you think you're doing? I mean... You stop that! I mean, really. Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make sure I've labelled all my organs correctly. Oh, Charles.... Get off of me! I don't believe this. What do you think you're doing? I'm your teacher. Not only are you going home but I will see to it that you spend next year back in high school. What is going on? - Get anything good? - Very kinky. - Give me that tape! - Come and get it. You're going to be very, very sorry, young lady. And as for you, you can forget about attending any film school. Ever! Relax, Wayne, he's not going to risk trying a thing. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Listen, this is going to sound supremely lame and I know it but I've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year. That's... so sweet, Wayne. And I really would love to stay and chat but I really am pressed for time. - Let's get together later. - I just thought... - Maybe we could... - (Sighs ) Wayne, you're an asshole. (Thunder crashes ) Oh, no! No! (Screaming and sobbing) No! No! No! (Screaming) Let's kick in the stabilizers, keep the seas off the quarter. Yes, sir. These kids are in for one hell of a storm. - How old's your boy now, Carlson? - 19 months. Tremendous age. Take some advice. Don't push him too hard. Yeah. (Garbled radio signal) - Take the helm, Jim. - Certainly, sir. (Thunder crashes ) I'd double-check those lifeboat stations, too, Carl... Oh, my God! - Can you take us home? - I'll call the Coast Guard for you. What about you? Are you staying here? I'm never going to be what he wants me to be, so I guess I'm going with you. Oh, Jesus! Dad? Oh, God. Oh, God. (PA) Attention, everybody. This is Sean Robertson. Have you seen JJ? She was supposed to be jamming in the power room. What I need, uh... This is an emergency. Everybody come to the bridge. What the fuck is this? Mayday... Mayday. Mayday! Shit. This is the motor vessel Lazarus. What's going on? - Jesus Christ. - Can anybody out there hear me? Thank God. Hello? Hello. Are you there? I demand to know what is going on! Christ. Sean, I... Where's the radio? It's dead. You're all gonna die. You're the last ones. He's come back for you. - What are you talking about? - Jason Voorhees. You're insane! Jason Voorhees has been dead for years. He came down the river and he got on board. He walks this ship here and now. Yes, a killer walks this ship. And it's certainly none of us! - Bastard! - What are you doing? You're the one who's insane. That lunatic has been talking about Jason ever since he came aboard. - It's no coincidence. - It doesn't prove he's the one. Walking corpses are not real. Oh, yeah? These dead bodies are real enough. Now, I say we regroup and let's go find this motherfucker before he finds us! - Are you with me? - Watch your mouth! You'll do no such thing. I'm in charge here! School is out, McCulloch. OK? Let's go. You come back here! Christ. Where's Rennie? She's dropping the anchors. - You had me worried to death! - Sean said to drop the anchors. I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes sense? Come on. Tamara? Did you hear the announcement? (Gasps ) (? Rock) (Screams ) (Screams ) (Choking) (Music stops ) We managed to scrounge this up in the game rooms and hallways. All right, grab what you want. - What are you taking, Julius? - Nothing... ..but this gun. JJ? JJ? Are you down here? JJ? - (Steam hisses ) - (Screams ) We got a major problem, Wayne. (Steam rushing) Shit, I can't see a damn thing. (Gunshot) No. No. Oh! (Groans ) JJ... (Screams ) Did you find Rennie? She's safe in her room, no thanks to you. Have you brought her back on course yet? He's doing the best he can. He's the son of a captain. He ought to be able to operate this thing. Do something! It worked. - We're back on course. - Good! (Alarm beeping) - What's that? - The fire alarm. (Alarm ringing) We thought about that. Nobody could see a flare gun in this storm. Only one person needs to see it. I'm gonna find that deck hand. But what about the fire? - How do we know there really is one? - What? Use some common sense. Setting off a fire alarm causes panic, the same panic caused by suggesting Jason is alive and on this ship. Enough is enough. (Screams ) (Screams ) (Ship creaking) (Eerie echoing) (Echoing) Help me! (Whimpering) - (Screams ) - Rennie. I don't understand what's happening to me. - What is that? - The power room. Listen. I want you to stay here until I get back with the others. - Understand? - Yeah. (Thunder rumbling) (Pot clunks ) Water's gotten into the engine circuit. (Alarm sounds ) We have to get everybody off the ship! (Sean) Quick! Dive! (Rennie) Sean! (Coughing and gasping) Rennie! What the hell? Let go of her! She shouldn't be on this ship! It's all your fault! - This is Jason's fault. - Not another word, you hear? No, I don't! You listen to me if you want off this ship alive. Thank God. I just lowered the lifeboat. We have to go. Wait! I left the others in the restaurant. There is no more restaurant. Come on, honey. Get back! Son of a bitch! Come on. (Shouting) Hurry up! Come on! Start rowing! (Sean) Come on! (Rennie screams ) Julius! Keep rowing! I hope you can find shore soon, Captain. We don't want to drown out here. Do you have any idea where we are, Sean? (Beeping) Hey. Hey, Sean. Come on, man. I made it, so can you. All right, man. Hey, man. Yo. Yo, wake up! (Julius ) Shit! Check it out! Damn! We're in New York! You did it, man, you did it! We are in New York! New York City! Whoo-hooo! Yeah! I don't believe it, we made it! ? If I can make it there I'll make it... ? Boom-boom, anywhere ? It's up to you ? New York, New York ? (Julius laughs ) There must be a phone around here. Wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr Robertson. Wonderful. (Colleen) I can't believe we made it. (McCulloch) Or that we're alive. (Colleen) We are all very lucky. - Give me your money. - Give him the money. Now! Here. (Mugger) Got some good shit here. You got that right. Give me your wallet. Come on. - Ain't that sweet. - Bastard! Go ahead Superman, be a hero. - Come on, now. - Got a problem, Dad? (Growls ) No! - Please don't hurt her. - Miss Princess? Would I do that? You look like a real party girl. Want to go on a date with me and my friend? If you're free, that is. Follow us, we blow her fucking head off. Comprende? Are we just gonna stand here? Let's go. Julius! Calm down, will you? You heard him, they'll kill her! We have to find the police! Now, look, I think it'll be more productive if we split up, OK? - But Charles, suppose... - No discussions now, please! Help! Stop it! Somebody help me! Shut the fuck up! - (Rennie wails ) - Welcome to the Casbah, princess. Please, don't hurt me. Loosen up, baby. You'll feel way better if you're stoned. (Screams ) Better sling her some more caine. We only got a half load here. We're in for a long night. (Spits ) It's your parade, princess. It can be smooth, it can be rough. It's your choice. (Rennie sobs ) Come on, baby. Lay back and enjoy it. I think I'm in love. (Screams ) (Yells in agony) Forgot my money, homes. (Rennie moans and weeps ) Who the fuck are you? You're dead, fuckhead. - (Gun clicks ) - Shit. (Screams ) Come on. Operator, this is an emergency, get me the police. Use the combos, keep the feet light. This is it. Take your best shot. Motherfucker. (Whimpers ) Rennie? What did they do to you? He's here, Sean. Jason is here. We have to find the others now. Freeze! It's OK, she's with me. My apologies, miss. Are you all right? (Sean) Hey! Rennie! Rennie. Oh, thank God. Are you OK? (Sean) Mr McCulloch, Jason is here in New York. - Rennie saw him. - Just shut up about Jason, will you? Is it true, Rennie? You're right. I find it a tall tale indeed but you seem honest so I kind of believe some of what you say. Yeah, well, first we need to find Julius. I'm sure he'll pop up. I'll call for backup. - (All scream) - Holy Jesus! Dispatch! (Colleen) Oh. No! No! (McCulloch) Hold it! What are you doing? (Tyres squeal) (Engine roars ) For God's sake, Rennie, slow down! Quickly! Let's move! Miss Van Deusen! (Birds twittering) It's so pretty today. Yep. Perfect day for swimming. Hm? You've been coming out here every summer for three years and you still haven't learned how to swim. I'll take some lessons this time. I promise. (Laughs ) That's what you said last year. I think the time has come for your first swimming lesson. You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you? He never learned how to swim, either. He's still in the bottom of this lake. - He is not. - He is. And he's ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim. - You're telling a lie. - Am I? Let's find out. Better swim, Rennie, before Jason pulls you down. - I can't! - You can and you will! Come on! Rennie, swim! (Screams ) You pushed me into the lake. I was only trying to teach you. You almost killed me. I was drowning! I pulled you out, I saved your life! You son of a bitch! He was down there. Rennie! Just keep away from her! Rennie! You. You! It's... it's not possible! (Screams ) Please! Please! I'm begging you! Please! (Choking) I was at school when they told me. "Rennie, your parents died in a car accident." It just seems like everybody I care about I lose. That's not gonna happen this time. (Crash) (Rennie screams ) (Gasps ) Help! (Brakes screech) (Man) What the hell are you doing?! (Man) Is this my stop? (Man) Get it moving! It's over. - Somebody, please... - Let's go! (Stereo) ? Livin' in the city ain't no big deal ? Livin' in the city ain't no big deal ? You gotta have a heart made of US steel ? If the crack don't get you then the hookers will... ? You are dead meat, slimebag! Yo, man. It's cool. It's cool, man, it's cool. - (Phone) - Di's Diner. Yeah. - We're open till 3am like always. - You've got to call the police. There's a payphone in back... but it's broke. Look, you don't understand, a maniac is trying to kill us. Welcome to New York. Son of a bitch. (Whispering) Come on! (Rennie) Come on! What are you kids doing down here? - Can you help us get out? - We haven't got a man to spare. - What do you mean? - Toxic waste. The sewer floods with the stuff at midnight, ten minutes from now. Follow me. (Screams ) You didn't get me in the lake and you're not gonna get me now! (Roars ) (Panting and sobbing) Sean. Sean, get up! Get up, Sean! Go! Climb! (Shrieks ) (Rumbling) (Child's voice) Mommy! Don't let me drown! Mommy?! (Roars ) Help! Help! (Thunder crashes ) (Echoing) Jason... I hear there's a statue here that's 22 storeys tall. (Whines ) Toby! ? Fallen angels take to the street ? It's an empty dance and so incomplete ? Their hollow voices whisper the cry ? Farther down the line there's a reason why ? You've tried before but you can't buy a clue ? No matter what you do ? The darkest side of the night ? Burns like a fire for the wasted lives ?
