I don't think so. I feel like you should know where you're going to wake up before you close your eyes. It s happened to me too often that I wake up and I m asking who are you? Where s my shit?" Do I have shit? I think I bought some shit and now I don t have it. I m just telling you that that kind of lifestyle you re going to end up kinda looking like... I don t know, like this. Fuck. I can t figure this place out. Usually I can capture the essence of a place but not here. It reads like no place I ve been. Indianapolis. Don t call it that. Why? Does that offend you? I don't get offended. Just annoyed. Well, that s the last thing I want to do. So where do you live hot shot? Nowhere. No house, no picket fence? I m from the city, I don t have a house. But I don't have an apartment either. So you re homeless? I have a gym membership and friends that let me crash. A gym membership? Yeah, I can go there and shower. Check in on the news.

You know the first bike you ever got, I bought you. It was a little red one. Do you remember that? No. Well, I did and we spent like two weeks, you and me, learning how to ride the thing ...and you did it. Eventually you did it. I guess the point I m trying to make is that it hasn t always been that bad between the two of us. Okay? There was some good stuff in there too. We re family. I m here now and I need some cash and I m going to pay you back. What the hell are you doing with yourself? I m asking my twenty one year old nephew to borrow money and it doesn t feel good but it is what it is. I m twenty. Okay. We ll get you a fake I.D. Here you go. Wow. Five hundred.

Every time I go through something really bad or painful in my life, my threshold you know it changes and I think there s that one dangerous thing that I m scared shitless about doing. I m going to cut back to like one pack a day. I m going to do my taxes this year. Maybe I should go see a doctor. I ve got some sharp pains. Spencer, my man. What the fuck? We re closed.

Yeah. Hmmm. You re not from around here either. How would you know? Just a feeling, really. Huh. You re right. I m from the borough of Queens, New York. Okay. I didn t think anyone was really from Queens. What brought you here? Guns. You re an enthusiast. I m enthused by money. How much do you have? Uhh... I have four. - Thousand. - No no no four... I got four - hundred. - Hundred! Four hundred dollars worth of bad intentions. Nah, you re not going to see me on the news or anything man. I just need protection. Oh... We all could use some of that. Four hundred dollars will get you one of these. Okay. I gotta to be honest man. I don t know dick about guns. Have you ever handled one before? Yeah, in a... in a past life. If I shoot somebody in the killing spot, will it kill them? - Probably. - Good. I ll take it. - Do I get bullets? - Oh, sure. There s a little box in here somewhere. I ll let you know where it is on my way out. Alright. Here you go. Pleasure doing business with you. Interesting tattoo. - Is it? - Yes, where d did you get it? Some guy in Fountain Square after a bender. Interesting in that I know of someone who has a tattoo like that. This someone once scammed my brother out of some money. Dice game. Craps. My brother was unable to hold down a steady job and he left his fortunes up to the gods of chance and we all know how false those gods can be. Do we? My brother was playing with a fellow who would consistently hit the number that he needed and often hit it at the exact moment that he needed it. My brother was slow on the uptake, but he caught on eventually but not before this grifter with a lowercase e. tattoo took off with his rent and the money intended to pay our dear mother s hospital bill. And you think I m this evil dice man? I think you re him. Okay. Look maybe, uh... maybe I played dice with your brother. and maybe he was too stupid to figure it out and maybe I took him for some money. But I m just a guy like you. Here to buy a gun. Don t be coy with me man. Let s not fuck around. Let s just conclude our business. This one will most definitely kill you in the killing spot. Let s relax man. Okay? Let s call your brother and we'll figure it out. He s dead. You think I did that too? No, no that s my fault. I killed him. Why? Because he was a little pissant too deplorable to live. Click. Poo. Click. Click poo. Click poo. Clearly you got a lot of stuff going on and that s fine. If you could just let me get out of here, that'd be great. I don t think you re going to shoot me. No? I think you re smarter than that? I think you realize that I m just a guy? A guy with four hundred dollars worth of bad intentions. I m broke. I got a gun with no bullets. If I really loved my brother, you d be dead. I think if you loved your brother, he d be alive. Bullets are in the bathtub. Fuck. Fuck. Hey feel free to make yourself something if you want. What the fuck is that? It s not a cigarette lighter. Take it easy. - Where s is she? - She s not here. Come here. - Take it easy Mac. - Come on. Open this. Come on Mac.

I think it could be good or bad. Well, tonight when you dream of a snake, think of me stroking it ever so slightly. Okay. I ll try. What about big dreams? Big dreams as in like life dreams? Mhm. Dreams are for the young. You re young. No, I m not. What about... you and I... we pack up and we get out of here? Is that your dream? I manage expectations, I start small. It s not easy for me to leave. Why not? Things are complicated. What kind of things? You don t want to know.

I got you... and I like you, a helluva lot more than him. That makes me all warm and gooey inside. Oh come on Mac. Be my friend. Married women don t need friends like me. I think a friend like you is just what I need. You're not going to let me inside? No I m not. You look pretty. Thanks, we re going out to dinner. Where? Italian place we like. That s delightful. So? I m glad you re alright. You should leave and never come back. I will leave when I get my money and my fucking car. I don t have either. People do what they have to do. That s all That's all I m going to say. I totally agree. I can see where Petey gets his calm. You know I smacked him around a little, borrowed his car. Mine disappeared after I got drugged in a meeting that you put me in. Is Petey alright? What do you think? He better be alright. What do you want me to say? I m sorry. That s it? You re out of your depths Mac. Cut your loses and leave. You know, I am real tired of people underestimating me. I didn t shoot Petey. But you fucked me Les and now all bets are off. Is this what happened to Big Pete? You snapped and then he had to go? You bite your fucking tongue. What about this new guy Bill? Mr. Fix It. Let s bring him out here. You re a fucking asshole, you know that? Am I? You underestimated all the people around here you kept fucking over. Yeah, I trusted you. You thought you were smarter than them. I trusted you!

All I had to do was make you go see him. Had no idea what for. That s it. I had no choice. I m glad you re okay. Now leave! Anything else? Bye Mac. I went to this club the other night. I don t know what these young people are doing that they're so fucking happy. You shouldn t be allowed to have fun until you get to like thirty eight and you ve really gone through some shit and you earned it. That s what it is. They haven t earned it. They re too young to have earned it. You shit yourself for the first decade and then your parents got you a sandwich and then you went to school or whatever kids do and now you re dancing. Fuck you. That s bullshit. There should just be clubs of parents. They re the ones that have made it. Clubs should be full of fucking old people dancing because we all fucking survived. Young people should just be at home in tears. So There s this New York Wall Street broker. He goes down at work, he has a heart thing. Right? It s bad. Ambulance. The whole deal. Goes to see his doctor. The doctor says this job is too much stress for you. You ve got to quit. Today. So he does. He buys a house in Montana on the side of a hill.

You alright with it?" No, that s fine. There s going to be narcotics too. Cocaine. You know, it s going to be rough. The guy says That s no big deal. Might be some violence. Some fighting that happens. Alright, I can handle that, I m from the city. Alright cool, I just want to be totally transparent with you. There s gonna be some, some sex. A lot of sex going on. I mean a lot. Like heavy fuckin'. You know. It s gonna be bad. Alright, I can t wait.

You know it? Not sure. Maybe. Hey look, it was nothing personal. You seem like an alright guy. You just don t know that well. It was my best play. Your best play is to go get that car and get outta dodge. What if he blackmails you again? Then I ll hit head on like I always do. Super Bowl baby. Every day. Hey Mac. Oh Petey. What s shaking? If you give me a ride to my car, I d really appreciate it. Okay, I ll just get out and you can have your car back. I kept her in tip top shape. Thanks for letting me borrow it. You re a real mensch.

Anyways, he stays and I just took everything from him. I mean everything that guy had. Do you feel guilty Shark? No. Should I? Probably not. Good. I don t. If you re bored than you re boring. What happened to your arm? I cut it during a bender. Where was I? You were out of town with your husband. You know speaking of, he s out of town until tomorrow. I popped some edibles and I m feeling nice and relaxed. Do you have any more? Not edibles. Other things. Crossroads of America. Why stay? There is nothing better than going to sleep after seeing the sunrise. Let s stay up real late. Okay. I m game. Here take these. What are they? Don t worry about it. Okay. Disregard everything I say from this moment on. What, you re going to finally tell me you love me? No, I would never do that. Because you don t? Cause you re married Evelyn and I don t think you want to hear it. And if I wasn t? You d probably be a lot more fun. You want fun, I ll show you fun. Welcome back to Indianoplace Mac. It s not so good to be back. What are you doing here? I m here for my money and my car. I see you still have the gun. I see you acquired one. You find some sucker to take care of your husband? Same sucker you used to rob me? What s he behind door number two down here or - something? - I had some help, he isn t here. He isn t here or no longer with us? Does it matter? Where s your husband Evelyn? He s out of town as usual. And he s not going to be my husband any longer. He s leaving me. Oh. What a shame. You were such a model wife. I needed a fresh start. Need a fresh start away from here. I offered you that eight months ago. Timing wasn't right. And it is now? Now, it s on my terms. Not yours. And not his. It was you that gave me the information on Les. I knew she didn t want it out there. I was waiting for you to come back and I m glad that you finally did. Those were hazy days Evelyn. I only remember a few conversations. I remember a lot of bad decisions. We had some fun. We had more than that. You re not going to shoot me, not in this house? It d be real messy in this house. You shouldn t have broken in. I feared for my life. You should. Mac, please! Mac please! Please! So what do you see when you look in the mirror? I try not to. What do you see? I see a man that s living free and easy. Keys. Where s my money? On the table, upstairs. I m sorry. Hey kid. Here s what you lent me. There s some extra in there for you too. Thanks for helping me out. I hope it helps you once graduate. Keep it in a safe place. Don t lose it. I won most of it fair and square. It s clean. Nobody will be looking for it. I m going to hit the road again. I don t know where I m going. I ll let you know when I get there. Keep moving forward, kid. Just keep moving. Ask that girl out. The cute one. Alright kid. I ll see you down the road. Detroit. I know some Greeks up there I can crash with. Head into Windsor. Toronto. Ottawa. Montreal. Quebec City. Watch some hockey. Work on my French. Maybe some new material. Sounds like a plan.
