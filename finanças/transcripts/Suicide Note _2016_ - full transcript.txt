"The best years of your life "are the ones in which you decide "your problems are your own. "You do not blame them on your mother, "the ecology, or the president. "You realize that you control your own destiny." Does anybody know who said this? Was it Albert Bandura? No. No, but you're close. All right, I'll give you a hint. He was the grandfather of cognitive behavioral therapy. Miss Molly White, do you know the answer? Albert Ellis? So why would being in control of your destiny be the best years of your life? I guess because the best years are when our decisions are still ours, good or bad, determined by our words. That way we can actually create the life that we want it to be. So, if you are in control of your own destiny, why did you not answer my question when I asked you in the first place? Are you sure it would have changed my destiny if I did? Perhaps not, but if you don't speak up, how will we ever know? All right, that's it for today. Remember, final papers due next Thursday. Molly. So I heard that the hospital has chosen their 10 summer interns. Congratulations. You've earned it.

The university approved the end-of-the-year party -at the pool next Friday. -Stellar. For everyone but me. This place is gonna be a disaster. We'll help you clean up afterwards.

I ran into the old janitor out back. 20 is all it takes here and he'll leave the door propped open. Well, if Allison catches you up here, I'm in deep-- She won't. Get dressed and come with me. Molly: Aww. Takeout and romance-- my favorite. Brady: And you're my favorite. So you'll have your own patients? In a sense. I have to have 15 to 20 hours of direct client contact each week. That's the pre-doctoral requirement. I'm so proud of you, Moll. And my mom wants to have us over for dinner to celebrate soon. And she'll cook actual food. Oh, no, Brady, this was so great. Thank you so much. So how is the final art project going? I don't know. It still feels a bit muddled. It's missing something. Well, maybe if you let me see it, I could tell you what it needs. Mm, I don't think so. Nice try though. Oh, come on. You know I won't judge. You know I will. You'll see it next week when everyone else does. Oh, fine. Oh, no. It looks like Emma and Adam had another one of their fights. She just got back. I should probably go check on her. Yeah, no problem. The drama never ends with those guys, huh? Anyway, I gotta run too. Scrabble fun on west campus. Very sexy. See? You do judge. I'm about to be a clinical psychologist. I merely observe. Why don't you observe this? Oh. All right, come on, let's get out of here. Just get out of here, Adam, please! I'm not going anywhere until we work this out. Adam, please. I just need a minute to think. -I need to be alone, okay? -No! I know, okay? No, we either go talk and we work this out or do it. Say something we both know you're gonna regret. I just don't know anymore. You still love me. Yeah. You're not ready for this to be over. We both know it. Adam, hey, did you hear what she just said? You need to go. You are so drunk, I can smell it on you. You both need to simmer, okay? Yeah, okay, thanks, but I don't need another shrink. So why don't you go mind your own damn business? Adam, stop. You promised me. Hey, hey, why don't you get lost before I call campus security to come and carry out the guy whose ass I just nailed to the floor? Irene. Adam, you need to go. Just go. Fine! All right? But we're finished. You are finished. Nobody dumps me. Adam, please don't be like that. It's okay. What happened? Another fight. I'm so sick of this fighting all the time with him. What was the fight about this time, huh? We both screwed up. But it was his fault first. I just reacted poorly. Maybe I should call him. No, forget it. You're not calling him. We promised each other when we started... That you wouldn't be violent with each other? Because he was two seconds away from punching your face. Yeah. I can't believe he acted like that. -I was scared. -Me too. I wasn't. I was gonna kill him. I just-- I wanted him to feel hurt, like he hurt me. But you're right. There's no excuse for violence. -Here. -Thank you. Look, Emma, you're always defending Adam, but he pulls a lot of crap. I mean, I know you love him, but maybe it's time to call quits. Yeah, because he is a tool. Emma: Yeah. So what if he is hot and going to be a doctor? My mom taught me so much better than this. I'm dumping him. I deserve better. You really do. I just need to shower and sleep now, I think. The room is kind of spinning. Okay, whoa, someone's had a little to drink. (all giggle) I'll be fine. What are you wrapping over there, Moll? Oh, it's a fancy steel paint brush that I got for Brady's graduation present. And I got his initials engraved. Aww, you guys are so cute. I wish Adam was more like Brady. Tomorrow's a new day, without Adam. Precisely. All right, I gotta go. -Just don't... -Text him. I know. I swear. Perfect. All right, bye, guys. -Good night. -Good night. -Hey, Moll. -Hmm? Thank you. You're a good friend. Hey, that's what friends are for. And if Brady and I ever get into a fight like that, I expect you'd do the same for me. Yeah. (woman screams) (knocks on door) Allison, what's going on? It's Emma. She committed suicide last night. Oh my God. So you were living with Miss Emma Duncan for how long? Do we need, like, an attorney for all this stuff? If it would make you feel more comfortable. I don't really see a need. You ladies aren't suspected of anything. But if either of you would like to call your parents first, then-- No, thanks. My folks would flip. And you? My parents are dead. So, Miss White, would you say Miss Duncan had suicidal tendencies? No, not at all. That's why this is all a bit of a shock. So you don't think Emma Duncan would have tried to kill herself? No. I mean, she was dramatic sometimes and emotional, but only in the way that girls our age are. She would fight with her boyfriend a lot. Her parents didn't really like him, you know. And this boyfriend would have been... Adam Bowen. Bowen's a student at the university? Yeah, he's pre-med. His parents are legacies here. They were fighting last night. Any idea what they were fighting about? She asked him to go and he refused. I think she was just tired of fighting. She was crying. They'd both been drinking. It's not uncommon for a kid to take their life over a split. She was dumping him. That's why it just doesn't make any sense. And you said they'd been drinking? Yeah, they were at a frat party. And they were arguing in the hall. I mean, everyone heard it. I thought boys weren't allowed in this dormitory. Yeah, that never stops him. Okay, we'll talk to Adam Bowen. How did she--? She jumped from the roof, just over the sidewalk. Are you sure that it was a suicide? I mean, she was drinking. She could have just fallen. Suicide note. Does this look like her handwriting? I don't know. I mean, you can check her backpack. I'm sure there's notebooks in there. All right. That's all for now. We'll be in contact if there's anything else. My card, if you need to reach us. But the whole thing just doesn't make any sense. Emma was fine last night. I thought you said she and Adam were fighting. Yeah, but it wasn't so bad that she would want to jump off a building. Babe, it sounds like Emma was a lot more messed up than anyone realized. No. Look, I just don't believe she would want to kill herself. I know what that part is like. Baby, I know this isn't easy for you, but the big difference is, I found you before it was too late. I mean, we found each other. Maybe Emma just didn't have the support you did. She had a great family. She had plenty of support. And she was so excited to go home next week. Sometimes depressed people wear a facade. You did, remember? -(knocks on door) -Come in. -Hey, how is it going? -Look at this. That's from the other night. She let Adam back into the building that night, after we went to bed. So you think he said something to make her jump? I don't know. I should talk to him. But I just know she didn't kill herself. How do you know? Don't you remember what she said that night before you left? "Tomorrow is a new day." You don't say that the night before you're gonna commit suicide, right? I mean, maybe if they were crazy and meant it as a morbid goodbye. Irene, not everyone who tries to commit suicide is crazy. Oh, Moll, I'm-- I had no idea. It's fine. It was before we knew each other. It was three days after I found out my parents were killed in a gas fire. I-- I wasn't thinking. I'm so sorry. But that's how I know for sure that Emma's not the kind of person to kill herself. I just-- I know it. But the texts don't prove that Adam saw her, just that-- But it proves there's a really good chance he was with her before she died and that he was the one that wanted to work things out. So what do you think happened? I don't know. Maybe she didn't want to work things out with him and he lost his temper and accidentally pushed her. Or maybe she stumbled and fell. Whatever it is, it makes way more sense to me than her committing suicide. Fine, but that still doesn't prove one crucial thing. What? The suicide note. She left one, remember? (gasps) (gasps) Now we've already discussed what the primary objective as a psychologist should be with their patient, yes? Look, I know that this is a-- it's a challenging day to be here on campus. But we're here, so I want us to discuss and try to understand why-- why somebody might want to take their life. Any thoughts? Maybe when they feel lost, like there's no escaping their problems. Or when something happens to someone they care deeply about and they just don't know how to pick up the pieces. Exactly. So tell me, who here has felt like that before? And I want you to be honest, okay? Come on, I want you to raise your hands, show me. See? Look around. Almost everybody has felt like that before-- lost, afraid, like there is no way back-- because that is all part of the human condition. And if you're gonna be a psychologist someday, that is probably one of the most important things that you can share with your patient without sharing your problems. Because it's important that they know there is always, always a way not to take their life... that there is a way back here, to us. We are all-- we are all in this together. I'd like us all to take a moment of silence now in memory of Miss Duncan. So, no coffee house? I don't know. I'm kind of tired. I'm probably just gonna go take a nap. -Okay, see you. -Bye. Molly. Hey, Molly. Hey, Jasmine. Hey. I haven't seen you around the dorms or at the shop. How are you doing? -I-- -Yeah. Yeah, me too. Did Emma say anything to you about that night, about anything? No. I mean, her and Adam were fighting, like they always do. Then she was just gone. I heard there was a note. It just said, "Sorry. Forgive me." I wish I would have been there for her. Hey, don't beat yourself up. I think Emma had a lot more going on than any of us knew about. Yeah, I guess so. Hey, are you working at the shop today? Yeah, I'm headed there right now. All right, well, I'll try and stop by soon. Maybe we can get her parents, like, a nice card or something. That sounds nice. You know, I was also thinking, maybe for the end-of-the-year dorm party, maybe we should have a candlelight vigil or something. Yeah, I think that would be really sweet. Cool. All right, I'll talk to you soon, okay? Okay, talk to you soon. -Adam. -Molly, hi. How did you get in here? I had Emma's key card. Yeah, she was so drunk the other night, when we got back, she dropped it trying to swipe. And I picked it up. I forgot I had it till earlier today. Okay, I'll take that. Look, you really shouldn't be here. No, I know. I just-- I've been so messed up, you know, over Emma. And I just was hoping maybe I could take a couple of pictures of us, you know, before her folks show up. I don't think they're gonna want to see me. Did you come back that night, after you left the first time? I was at the frat house all night. Why would I have come back? I saw Emma's text messages. I saw her ask you to meet her out back after midnight. You never said no. Do you think I did something on purpose to hurt Emma? Did you? Because what you're telling me right now does not add up at all. Listen to me very clearly. I didn't lay a hand on Emma. You understand? He's probably just trying to scare you. Doesn't mean he hurt her. But if he didn't hurt her, then why would he lie about meeting up with her? Maybe he didn't. Maybe she didn't show. But he had her key card. And he had no problem breaking in today, so what was different about that night? (chuckles) Come on. What do you think he did? You think he manipulated her into jumping? It sounds a bit absurd. Well, maybe they got in a fight or something and he accidentally pushed her. I mean, that sounds a lot more feasible to me than suicide. And why else would he lie about coming back here? Maybe-- maybe he was afraid that you would accuse him of something he didn't do. People go to jail all the time for murders they didn't commit, especially when they're romantically involved with the victim. I never said he murdered her, Brady, okay? But people who are romantically involved with the victim often do kill their lovers. There's a reason that those assumptions exist. And, I mean, if he has nothing to feel guilty about, then why is he so worried now? Are you sure this is good for you-- going down this road? Look, I want to be here and support you if something's going on, but are you sure this isn't more about you? I dreamt about Emma last night. I followed her through our hallway and I saw her jump. She was wearing my bracelet. What does psych say about that? Probably that I'm manifesting my own suicide attempt due to the impact that hers has had on my subconscious. Maybe that's it. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that is it. But if it's not, what then? Then we do what we have to do. -Hey. -Hey. How is it going? -Good. How are you? -Good. Thank you. So what did Adam say exactly? Well, at first he swore he didn't come back to the dorms at all, but then I caught him in a lie and he admitted to coming back but swore that Emma never came outside. Yeah, right. You need to call the detective and tell him you caught him sneaking into your room. What would it change? They have a note with Emma's handwriting. That he clearly forced her to write before pushing her over the edge. I'm not entirely certain that he did anything though. Yes, you're right. He still had her key card and he probably just would have come in, but I do still have Emma's texts on her phone. I could show those to the cops and see if they want to question him. Smart move. Only make sure they leave your name out of it. You don't want Adam knowing what you're up to. -Yeah. -Hey, guys. We have fresh cowboy cookies in case you get hungry. Okay, great. Thanks, Jas. Don't look now, but since when do serial killers get lattes? Hey, I'll be right back, okay? Change your mind about the cookies? Oh, yeah, sorry. Sure, I'd love one. Hey, are you okay? Looked like you and Adam were, like, fighting back there. I couldn't help but notice. We were just arguing about something stupid-- you know, whether I should send flowers to Emma's parents. Doesn't really seem like his decision, does it? No. I didn't even know you and Adam were friends. We're not. It's just everything with Emma. Well, be careful with him, will you? He confronted me in the dorm. And he got violent with Emma when he was drunk. He did? Yeah, I think this whole traumatic experience has, like, muddled with his frame of mind. Well, there's nothing to worry about. I barely know Adam. (Emma's voice) Molly. Molly. (gasps) If you had a dream that you committed suicide, it's probably just you trying to escape the reality of the messed-up situation that you're in. I mean, that's the usual gist. It doesn't mean that you want to kill yourself again. Yeah. No, I know. But it feels like it's my subconscious telling me to keep going. Do you remember when we learned that the subconscious has 95% control over our minds? I feel like it's telling me I'm not wrong. And what does it tell you about Emma's missing phone? You know, my best guess is Jasmine. And I wondered if maybe that's why Adam came by the shop. He doesn't have a key card now, so maybe he asked her to break into the room and steal the phone so that they're both off the hook. Did you read the messages between Emma and Jas? Yep. Emma definitely knew something was up. And Jas apologized for it by saying, "I'm sorry. Forgive me." The same thing that Emma wrote in her note? Oh, that is so weird. So what are you gonna do now? I mean, you don't have the phone to give the detective when he comes. Well, I might, if I do exactly what she did to me. Which is? I'm gonna break into her room and steal Emma's phone back. Hey, what's up? Hey, I was wondering if I could borrow your flat iron. Mine just fried my hair like a chicken strip. Yeah, let me get it. -Here you go. -Thanks. I'll bring it right back. No rush. Take your time. Jas, hey. -Yeah? -We know about you and Adam. What about me and Adam? That you two were seeing each other. Irene, don't you have anything better to do with your time, like, I don't know, study for finals? We call that aversion. What do you want from me? Did you or did you not steal Emma's phone out of Molly's room last night while she was sleeping? I don't know what you're talking about. Look, if Adam asked you to take the phone to keep your secret, he's lying to you. Unless you're the one who has something to hide. What were those messages between you and Emma about? Look, if you want to head-shrink someone, look no further than your own delusion. I loved Emma. She was my friend. Now get out of my face. So you saw these alleged texts too? Yes. Molly isn't lying, Detective. I'm not accusing anyone of lying, Miss Keating. It's just in the emotion of the moment, maybe you missed or misread something. I didn't misread anything. They were supposed to meet up at midnight. There's nothing indicating they didn't. Via text. Maybe he called her. Did you check the call logs too? And now you think he broke into your room to steal her cell to cover his tracks? We think it might have been this girl that we knew Emma was friends with. And why would he want to help her? We think they're involved. We saw them talking last night. You think they're involved just because you saw them talking? Look, if you say he broke into your room to steal her phone, we'll talk to him again. But a few angry texts probably doesn't warrant suspicion to a homicide. -I gotta go. -Come on. -Bye. -Bye. Hey, what is going on? Emma's phone-- someone broke into my room and took it. I think it was Adam, but I don't know for sure. Babe, you don't look so good. I'm fine. I just-- I keep dreaming about Emma. I haven't been sleeping very well. You miss your friend. I get it. Hey, tonight, after the gallery opening, let's get dinner, and we'll stay at my parents' place, yeah? I completely forgot, Brady. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Just be here now, okay? Okay. Moll, that doesn't go with your dress. I don't have anything else to cover up my scar. I always wondered where you got this anyway. Brady gave it to me when we first met. I used to use all different kinds of things to cover it up, but I figured that goes with everything, so... You have nothing to hide, Moll. You know, you should be proud of your scars. We all have them. Make them your strength, not your weakness. You know what? Here. That's better. Irene: It's wicked. I love it. -Good job, son. -And what's it called, dear? "Lost into the Light." Mother: But what does that mean, Brady? I-- I don't understand. What does it mean to you? I don't know anything about art, dear. You know that. I mean, aside from those lovely serving bowls you made me back in pottery class in middle school. Mom, I've told you before, you don't need to know anything about art. Just tell us how it makes you feel. Like waking up from an extended hibernation. I mean, maybe she was in an abusive relationship and now she's finally breaking free of his grasp. What about you? What do you think? I think she died, and this is her resurrection to the heavens. I think you've been spending too much time around our son. Oh, you know what? I'm so sorry. Would you guys excuse me for a minute? Oh, I missed you in class today. I'm sorry. I've just been a little distracted. Emma? I've been having dreams about her. What kind of dreams? Well, the first one, she was wearing my bracelet and I followed her through our dorm and watched her jump. And last night it was me. And I could hear her calling out to me. Then I jumped. It sounds like a manifest content of your own attempt. Wait, how did you know? Molly, it's not like your bracelets cover anything. I have known you for a long time. And you are much healthier now than when I first met you. You've lived a very challenging life, and I think that is what makes you one of the best students I have ever had. You are gonna be a great psychologist someday. Your dreams are healthy and I don't want you to be afraid of your subconscious, because you can learn a lot about yourself. Now stop cutting my class. Really, you have one more week left. Okay. And by the by, your boyfriend is quite talented and cute, so why don't you go over and hang with him? -Okay. -Okay. Okay, you take care. Don't forget, don't miss class. Okay. Doug, what are you doing here? I thought you were in engineering. I am. I just like art, I guess. Hey, do you mind if I ask you a question? Emma's boyfriend Adam-- do you by any chance know if he was hooking up with Jasmine at all? I don't want to put you in a difficult position. I just-- I really need to know. One time I saw them in his car, so... Yeah, that's what I thought. -Thanks. -No problem. -So I'll see you around? -Yeah. -Hi. -Hi. -You all right? -Yeah, yeah, sure. I just need to run to the restroom really quick before we go, okay? Sure. -(screams) -Was that Molly? Are you okay? What happened? Yeah-- no, I'm fine. I just-- I stuck my hand in my purse and something cut me. What the hell is a surgery scalpel doing in your purse? I don't know. I didn't put it there. Also, this was left under my purse. I mean, I saw Adam over by you guys, and when I headed back over there, he was already gone. But I saw him put it in there. Of course he did. He's pre-med. I mean, they use these in class every day. Frickin' psycho. What are you gonna do with it? If Adam comes anywhere near you again, I'm gonna use it on him. Molly, are you all right? Yeah, just a little cut from the towel dispenser. It's fine. -Are you sure? -Yeah-- no, I'm fine. Are you ready to go? Yeah. Brady: Do you guys believe in angels? Molly: I'm so sick of you asking that. So Brady tells us you got accepted into some really great internship. Yeah, it's a summer clinical study under the doctors at Fountain Creek. Isn't that where they keep all the mental patients though? They're fine. They just need help. Hey, you kids need to mark your calendar. Our time share this summer is late June, no ifs, ands or buts. Molly, did you hear that, dear? Florida this summer? It's our treat. Mom, stop. We'll see, all right? We're just not sure what we're doing yet. Oh, I know what you're doing. You're coming to Florida. Sorry about my mom. Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. I think I just need to get some sleep. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. Are you okay? Are you okay? Don't worry, I'll get you back in time for your psych class. I've got that graphics final I've got to study for anyway. Hey, look, I'm sorry I've been so out of it lately. Thanks for being so sweet. That's what a good boyfriend does. Molly: I'm so proud of you. I mean, your final piece was amazing. Brady: Yeah, except it totally creeped my mom out. What did inspire you anyway? It's a lot darker than your usual stuff. I don't know. I just kind of went that way. But it was supposed to be a positive thing, like kind of how you described it last night. I had a dream last night that it was Emma in the painting. It's weird, huh? You think it was Emma? Like what? Like I was clairvoyant to her death or something? Like I knew? That's not what I said. Well, that's kind of what it sounded like. Brady, you can't control your subconscious mind. It just is. Exactly. Hence my work of art, which has nothing to do with Emma. Okay, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. It's fine. I just-- I didn't even mean anything by it. So you finish your thesis paper? No, I still have more than a few hours to finish it tonight. (phone rings) Hello. Adam: The police questioned me again this morning because of you. I swear to God, Moll, if you don't let this thing go, I'm gonna have my father's lawyer so deep down your throat, you'll wish you still had your parents around to protect you. Are you all right? Who was that? It was Adam. He left a threat on a napkin last night at your art opening, saying that if I didn't leave him alone, I would end up just like Emma. Oh my God. Baby, why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to bother you. With your parents and the art opening and all, I just-- Molly, you should have said something. That was him calling? What did he say? He said that he would have his father's lawyers all over me if I didn't stop talking to the cops about him. Did you call the cops again? I texted Detective Harrison a photo of the napkin last night. Moll listen to me, please. If this Adam guy is dangerous, you need to steer clear of him and let the cops do their jobs. I know you care about Emma, but I care about you. I don't want to see you get hurt, okay? Hey. How is that paper coming along? You look tired. I imagine it's been tough on you, but Emma would have wanted you to graduate with flying colors. Did you know Emma? Not really. She loved our biscottis. I remember that. She was a neat girl. So are you, Molly White. Hang in there. The night watchman didn't see anybody. Probably 'cause he took off out the back door. So how did this person get in the dorm in the first place? Can the girls' key cards be copied? Well, he got in somehow. Maybe Jasmine let him in. She could have taken the staircase, and no one would have even seen her let Adam in. Irene, you don't just go around accusing the other girls of-- You do, if she's screwing the same psycho that just attacked my friend. Look, we'll talk to Bowen about this first, try to find out where he was tonight. We have your report. And we'll keep one of our guys out front to keep an eye on things too. Will you be okay? Irene: Oh, that's-- it's okay. It's her boyfriend. What the hell happened? What the hell happened? Baby, baby, are you okay? It was Adam. He attacked her in the gym. Allegedly. We don't know for sure who it was. -She didn't see a face. -Well, who let him in? Well, that's what we're looking into. We will have the building on lockdown for the rest of the night, so she'll be fine from here on out. Like hell she will. I'm staying here tonight. Screw the rules. And if Bowen did do this, we'll get him, okay? You didn't tell your parents what's going on, did you? And give my mother a heart attack? No. I just told her I had to study for finals. Good. (water running) Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Stay away from my girlfriend. You tell her to stay away from me. I had the cops knocking on my door again last night, thanks to her. 'Cause you attacked her in the gym last night, you prick. Don't deny it. How do you not know she's not making this all up, huh? She's crazy. Yeah, yeah, I know all about you cutting your wrist with a razor. My dad's attorney is already all over you. How do we know you didn't do something to Emma, you crazy bitch? Stop it right there! Stop, stop. Go, go right now, before I call security. Go to class. You too. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. -Brady: Are you okay? -Professor: Molly, are you all right? I said go. Let's go. What is going on? You okay? Here is my final paper. Thanks, Molly. Look, what is going on here? You look-- you look terrible. Have you even been sleeping? Not really. What is it with you and this guy? He's my dorm-mate's boyfriend. And I asked the cops to question him, because he and Emma were fighting a lot and I got to thinking maybe he pushed her. What do you mean, he pushed her? Molly, there was a suicide note. Yeah. I still can't explain that part. Maybe he wrote it for her. I mean, he knows her handwriting. Have you-- have you shared this theory with the police? Yeah. But I have no proof. No one saw anything. And now Emma's phone's gone. Not that that would have proven much anyway, but-- I just know she would not have hurt herself. You know what, Molly? If this guy did what you think he did, the police are gonna find out. But you are putting yourself in jeopardy. There is nothing-- nothing you can do for Emma. Last night I dreamt she was the one attacking me in my room. And then she was crying, like she was sad about it. I really am sorry, but you have got to take care of yourself. Hey, good news. So my brother is knee-deep in finding us some answers. He's gonna meet us at the shop tonight. Okay. Molly: Are you sure you can pull this off? My brother in high school hacked into our principal's email and called for an official Skip Day for students and teachers, as a freshman. What is hacking into Adam's email gonna accomplish, other than just getting us all in a lot of trouble? And what makes you think he'd even keep email that incriminates him in a murder? We thought about that, so we're hacking into Emma's instead. Hacking into a dead person's email? Does anyone else see us crossing an ethical line? And letting a murderer go free is ethical? Molly, you realize they're hacking into the university server? Not only could we get expelled, but in this day, we could get charged with a first-degree felony. There's the door. No one's forcing you to stay. Brady, wait. Brady, Brady, wait. Look, they're just trying to help, okay? Molly, don't you see what this is doing to you? This has to stop. Hey, why don't we get out of here? Let's go back to my parents' place. I can't, okay? I can't just get away, Brady, even at your parents' house. She'll be there. Who? Emma. Baby, you seriously think you're being haunted by Emma's spirit? I think I'm being haunted by me. Look, I feel responsible for her death for some weird reason, because I know she didn't commit suicide, and she's not here to defend herself. Someone has to. Molly, this isn't about Emma. This is about you. You remember when we first met, you said you used to self-handicap? It's exactly what you're doing right now. So just-- just forgive yourself, so we can move on. I can't go down another messy road with you. That's what my parents' death was to you-- a messy road? That's now what I meant. I-- Look, Brady, just go home, okay? I would hate to have to drag you down another messy road. What are you girls up to? Doesn't your dorm have a hard curfew tonight for some reason? I thought that's why Jasmine left. Oh, yeah. That's right. I almost forgot. Yeah, we need to go. Yeah, thanks for the reminder, Doug. Right. I need 10 more minutes. We're almost done. Can you, like, send me a log-in to an FTP site or can we only access it here from your laptop? No, I can send you a link. But, what, are you ditching me now? Well, yeah. You heard him. We have a hard curfew. Hey, do you want me to crash here tonight? That way we'll be together when I get Jared's email. Yeah, sure, thanks. But I'm gonna shower first, so I'll just leave the key under the mat for you, okay? Okay, I'll see you in a sec. (water running) (knocks on door) Come in. Molly, is that you? (knocks on door) That's not funny. Molly, get out here right now. Irene? Irene. Irene. You said a lot of kids already headed home for the summer. Are you sure Miss Keating didn't take off a little early for herself? No, she wouldn't do that to me. Was she done with her finals? Yes, but she wouldn't do that. She was supposed to stay in my room last night. She wouldn't have just disappeared like that. Her backpack and purse are gone. What makes you think she didn't? Because her and I were in the middle of-- of-- of planning on what we were gonna wear to the pool party tonight. There's a party tonight, after everything that's gone on here? It's an end-of-school tradition and a candlelight vigil for Emma. Maybe she was out shopping for the party and her phone is dead. No, she is missing, okay? And you need to start doing something about it now. I'm sorry, sir. It's just-- it's been a rough week. I think she could use a break. We were supposed to go to my parents' this weekend. -Maybe it will help. -Listen, we'll put out some calls. We'll do our best to locate Miss Keating. But I'd like Miss White to stick around until we've located her friend. -Why? -Adam Bowen's attorney made claims that Miss White was the one having issues with Miss Duncan. -He's lying. -Listen, I'm not convinced you've done anything wrong, Miss White, but I'd rather know where you are until we have more answers on this thing, okay? Okay, thank you, Detective. It's okay. Well, I think almost everything is done. -Jasmine, hey, can I talk to you? -No. Look, I never actually thought that you were capable of hurting Emma. That didn't stop the detective from questioning me the other day. Listen, Irene's gone missing. What? Irene's missing? Yes, as of last night. And I have strong reason to believe that Adam's involved. He gave me this. But he said you were harassing him. Look, I'm not saying Adam murdered Emma, but did you ever really think that Emma was the kind of person that would commit suicide? -No. -Exactly. Emma was happy. She was really into sappy lit, but she was happy. Exactly. So the bottom line is, if Adam knows anything about what happened that night and he's not sharing, I have to know. You're right. Emma deserves that much. Truth is, yes, I-- I was sleeping with him. And yes, I did take the phone from your room, but because Adam asked me to. I'm sorry. Do you still have that phone? No. I gave it to Adam. He said it was the only way to keep it a secret. And I didn't want Emma's parents seeing what I did. It wasn't just sex between us. I had feelings for Adam. And the only reason I even went there is because Emma was doing it first. Wait, wait, what do you mean, Emma was doing--? Doing what? She just said she met someone else and that she was in love. You should talk to Doug. He would always talk to her when she came in the shop. I kind of thought it was him. Doug? He said he barely knew her. I'll try and talk to him. Hey, Molly, I'm sorry about Irene. I know she was your best friend. I hope you find her. If Doug was sleeping with Emma and he can confirm that Adam found out, then that would be enough motive for Adam to just lose it, you know? And what makes you think Emma was sleeping with this guy from the coffee shop? Jasmine told me. Well, she doesn't know for sure, but she's-- she thinks it was probably Doug. Okay. We'll talk to this guy at the party and see what we can find out and just hope Irene shows up, I guess. Yeah. But I need you to stay in your dorm room until I get back, okay? Of course. I'm gonna try and take a nap and see if I can get some sleep. Okay, I'll be back in a little bit. -Adam, jeez. -Molly, look, I don't want to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. Look, regardless of what you did, I'm not letting this thing go. So whatever really happened that night, you gotta come clean now. Listen, I didn't hurt Emma, all right? There's no proof because it doesn't exist. Well, I know things now that don't put you in a very good light, and I'm pretty sure the cops will be very interested to hear. -Like at? -Like the fact that you were probably in a jealous rage the night you discovered Emma was cheating on you. I bet you felt this intense loss of control and a desire to push her. You didn't mean to push her over the edge. It was just an impulsive mistake. And you freaked. You wrote a note in her handwriting. Just-- just admit it, Adam. That's what really happened that night. Fine, all right? You're right. I found out Emma was cheating that night. She confessed it. And so did I. And that's what we were fighting about when you saw us in the hallway. But when I came back to the dorm later that night, it wasn't to fight. We made up. And that note-- Emma did write it. But it wasn't a suicide note. It was an apology to me. She wanted to work things out. I don't believe you. I mean, why didn't you just tell the cops that in the first place? And be the prime suspect in a potential homicide? Yeah, right. Look, I wondered if someone had pushed Emma too. But if I had told the cops what I really thought, then it would have looked like it was me. And it does, Adam. But I didn't kill Emma. I loved her. And since you were the one who kept pointing the finger, I thought it might have been you, at least till a minute ago, when you said you loved her. I can tell you do. But I did too. And I would never hurt her, or you. But you left me a note saying that I would end up just like her. And you put a scalpel in my purse. Because you were ruining my life. All right? But I didn't attack you in the gym. I wouldn't even know how to get in. I just want this all to be over. Maybe you paid the janitor to let you in. It wouldn't have been the first time. You're barking up the wrong tree, Molly White. And if you want to keep pursuing this, fine. But my lawyers will fire back. And just ask yourself one little question-- would you really want to put an innocent man in prison for murder without knowing for certain? Because I can tell by the look on your face now, you're not so sure anymore it's me. Hey. You lied to me about knowing Emma. Why? Did you sleep with her, I mean, because you already knew that Adam was cheating with Jasmine? Did you use that to your advantage? What? No. I never slept with Emma. Why would you even think that? I wondered if maybe you confessed your feelings to her and she went back to Adam that night. You got angry, accidentally pushed her off the rooftop. I told you, I barely knew her, okay? Jasmine told me that you would talk to her all the time when she came into the shop. So what are you trying to hide? Fine. Yes, I talked to her because I liked asking her about you. You know, I remember you were in the shop one time working on a paper and you said, "The biggest problem with the world today is selective reasoning-- politics, religion, classism, racism." I was like, "This is the prettiest, most intuitive girl I've ever seen." Guess I was wrong. Must have been my own poor selective reasoning, huh? (Irene's voice) Molly, we're here. Molly: Irene? (whistling a tune) Excuse me. Molly. Sorry. -Lacey. -Yeah? Hi. Do you know where Molly is? Yeah, actually I saw her earlier today. -She should be around here somewhere. -All right, thanks. -Mm-hmm. -Sorry to bother you. (knocks) Molly, are you in there? Babe? Molly. Babe, are you in here? Molly? Oh, I really thought I fixed that. Baby, I can hear you breathing. And I'm glad you're here, because I finally have a chance to explain myself. Yes, I did hook up with Emma once or twice. It's just-- I felt bad for her. She was vulnerable, kind of like you were when we first met. She was dating that idiot. And I ran into her crying in the quad one night. I offered her a ride and one thing led to another. God, baby, I'm so sorry. But this isn't what you think. I didn't hurt Emma. And I would never hurt you. You don't have to be afraid of me. It's-- just please come out, baby, please. How did you get in the dorms, Brady? One of the girls was coming out. You still don't believe me. I dreamt I saw you in the art hall writing a suicide note in my handwriting, for me. It couldn't have been me that attacked you, because I was at my parents' in the countryside that night, remember? Yeah. No, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm just-- You're spooked about Irene. I get it. We have a lot we have to talk through. But we can do that this weekend at my parents' place. They're-- they're gone. We'll have the whole house to ourselves. Okay. I'll just finish packing. I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna delete this real quick. It's just you and I. Help! -Man: The rash? -It's clear, yeah. Molly, what the hell? Baby, I told you, I didn't do anything. Don't come any closer. You pushed Emma, didn't you? You pushed her because she wanted to tell me the truth. And Irene-- you just choked her to death. You put her under Emma's bed like a rag doll. Wait, Irene's dead? Don't act like you don't know that. She read those emails and you silenced her. You killed my best friend! All this time, it was you, right in front of me. And I couldn't see it because I loved you-- selective reasoning. You're not making any sense right now. Tell me the truth, Brady, please. The truth is, I ended things with Emma. And I only came over here that night to tell her not to do something crazy. We were arguing on the roof and she said she loved me and she just refused to accept that I chose you. I tried to talk her out of it, but she just jumped. You saw the note yourself. I know that that note was meant for Adam. And I know she didn't jump because of you. She wanted to work things out with Adam. But she wanted to tell you first, because she felt bad. And she wanted to come clean to me. Which only left you with one reality-- to kill her. It was an accident. I was just trying to talk to her. I was trying to reason with her and I grabbed her and she-- she slugged me and I pushed her in self-defense. And the next thing I knew, she was gone. I didn't mean to. I just-- I didn't want her to ruin everything that we worked so hard to have. But you were sleeping with her, so clearly we didn't have what you thought we had to begin with. Molly, my whole life shouldn't have to end because of a mistake I made with Emma. We can let Adam take the fall for this. He's not even a good person. And I have been there for you through everything. Emma may have been an accident, but you're a murderer now. You killed Irene. And you tried to kill me too the other night in the gym. No, I didn't want to kill you. I was just trying to scare you, so you'd stop digging. And now Irene is dead in your room. You're the last one who saw her alive. And you're the girlfriend of the guy Emma was sleeping with. As far as anyone knows, you got jealous and you pushed Emma, and then you murdered Irene to cover your tracks. The detectives-- they already seem to think that something's a little off with you. I'm the only alibi you have. No. No one would ever believe I would do that. I was trying to solve her murder. Or frame someone else for it. Residents only, ma'am. I loved you so much, Moll. From the moment we met, I spent countless hours trying to paint us into the picture we were supposed to be. You've just ruined it. Thanks a lot. Oh, well, here's my ID. I'm a professor here at the university. Can you please open the door for me? Would you just stay still? Brady, wait. "The best years of your life are the ones when you decide your problems are your own. You don't blame it on anyone else, not your overbearing mother, or any other woman in your life. You realize you control your own destiny." Who said it? I don't know. But I suppose it's true. And that is why I have to take control. That's why I'm gonna stage your death to be a suicide for the guilt you felt over killing Emma and then Irene. I'm an artist. I'll forge your handwriting. I just hate that it has to end this way. That said, I am curious-- who said it? It was me. -(knocks on door) -Molly. Molly, are you okay? Shh. Oh my God. Oh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh, it's gonna be okay. Molly, are you all right? No. But at least now maybe Emma and Irene will be. Miss White, this way, please. The usual? But you're not at your usual table. Yeah, I guess I just needed a change. The old table wouldn't be the same. So how was your summer? Coffees, lattes and cowboy cookies. I think I'm ready for the fall. You? Well, my internship has me insanely busy, but helping people is really the best distraction I could have asked for. Well then, cheers to grad school and to some normalcy once again, huh, Molly White? I'll cheers to that.
