FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Todd, I've been thinking a lot lately. Yeah, me too, Emma. This whole you-and-me thing? Yeah? It just isn't working. What? I thought everything was going great. Emma, I think I'm ready to take it to the next step with you. You know what I mean? You and me... building a real life here together. That's the thing, Todd. I love this place, I do, but it's not enough. I wanna travel. I wanna go places, see things, do things. Here, look. These. They're amazing. I would love to do those things. But we have to be realistic. I have my business. Your father's business. You have your diner. But, Todd, there has to be more to life than pushing meatloaf on Thursday and topping up coffee cups. What about Alice? You two have had it really rough these last few years, and I admire every ounce of fight that you have in you. But, Emma, that isn't gonna put your sister through college. I can. Sorry, Todd. I can't marry for money. This isn't about money. This is about history. Our history. When you're ready to wake up and stop dreaming, give me a call, but don't wait too long. Opportunities come and opportunities go. Timing is everything, babe. Todd, wait. You're unfocused. Instinct. Instinct always comes first. What's going on? Tell me what the trouble is. Geoffrey, in seven day's time, I'm to marry a perfect stranger in front of thousands of other perfect strangers, and you ask me what the trouble is? I think "perfect stranger" is stretching it a bit, but... I get your meaning. I mean, it's archaic. Whoever heard of an arranged married in this day and age, for goodness sake? I mean, Isabelle, yes, she's very sweet and certainly she's very beautiful, - but there's just no... - Spark? Spark. Exactly. And what does your bride-to-be think about all this? I have no idea. I think the poor girl read about it in the bloody newspapers. Duncan, I've watched over you since you were born as your trusted confidant and valet, but more importantly as your friend. And as your friend, I implore you follow your heart, not what tradition and certainly not what the ministry has to say. You speak treason. Fluently. Come on. Hey, lady, wanna buy some flowers and help a poor kid get to New York City? I'm running a special right now for big sisters. Thanks, kid, but I didn't make enough today to buy the vase, let alone the flowers. Things still slow, huh? Well, how did it go with the King of Cars? Oh, that good, huh? Don't worry about him. He'll get over it. When I told him no, he actually said, "Timing is everything, babe." - That must have stung. - Yeah. So how are sales? Slow, but they'll pick up. Listen to this: "Balemont's royal family is a staid and lifeless relic of a medieval past, and it is time to create a true 21st century republic." Well, at least we still have the support of the prime minister. That was the prime minister. Then it's settled. He's sitting next to your mother during the reception. Is everything all right, dear? You haven't touched your pheasant. I want you to call this wedding off. Why on earth would I do that? This is going to be the most spectacular Christmas wedding that this country has ever seen. Isabelle is a terrific young woman. She'll make an ideal princess. I'm not in love with her. Oh, that. Well, what's love got to do with it? You don't think love's important? Don't be silly, Duncan. It's only a wedding. Dad... when you and Mom got married, didn't you love each other? Well, yes, of course. We were very lucky. I still remember the first time I laid eyes on you. The Duke of Norwood's Ball. There wasn't a more beautiful woman in all of Balemont. And there still isn't. You see, I want that. I want to know what true love is. I need to know for myself. Duncan, there are much bigger things at stake here than love. Did you know that after Prince William's wedding, support for the British royals rose by over 150%. Can't you just add a three-day holiday to the calendar or reduce taxes or something? I cannot and I will not be a part of this conversation, and I'm not calling off the wedding. And besides, I've already sold the cable and internet rights. Children... Well... Well, there you have it. What is it, another woman? No. Another man? Father, please. I jest. What's the problem? You've had plenty of time to find a suitable girl. I know. I've gone out with about a dozen women, and I've never found one that I couldn't live without. I mean, isn't that the point? Isn't that what it's supposed to be, that you couldn't live without them? It's hard to explain. But when it happens, you'll know it. I can't do this. Alice, breakfast! Thanks. So, Big Sis, I've been thinking... Not again. Very funny. Anyway, I've been saving up some cash, and I was thinking how drab this place is. And? How about I buy us a Christmas tree? Come on, Emma. It's been three years. Can we talk about it later? We can, but we never do. I'll think about it, okay? Emma... a Christmas tree didn't kill our parents. A car did. Don't forget your flower forms. You got a quota to meet if you're gonna help your school make that trip. I've got them in my backpack. Don't worry. I'm your big sister. It's my job to worry. Now come on, or we'll both be late. I don't understand why I can't have my brie omelet and black pudding. I am the bloody king, after all. You do want your royal robes to fit, don't you? Now just stick to the oatmeal. - Your Majesties. - Thank you, Geoffrey. Separate out the sports section for Duncan, will you? He's always so rabid about the results. Where is Duncan? He's 15 minutes late. I'm afraid the prince is not at home. What do you mean, the prince is not at home? Well, he's gone, Your Majesty. - Gone? - Exactly. I went up this morning to roust him, and I noticed that his bed had not been slept in, and his travel case and some clothes are missing. But the wedding's in one week. I don't have time for this kind of nonsense. On the contrary, Ariana. Perhaps this is exactly the kind of nonsense the boy does need. Time alone to sort things out. Don't be ridiculous! He's a grown man, and he's proving it to us right now. I won't stand for it. Geoffrey, endeavor to find him for us, will you? Most certainly. Of course, Your Majesties. Actually, I wonder where he has gone. In 100 feet, turn right, then continue north to the New York Expressway. North? Which way's north? Continue for another half-mile. Oh, for goodness sake. Recalculating. Yes, thank you. Recalculating. Turn east, then make a U-turn. Look, could you just tell me how to get back to the main road? Continue another 400 feet. In 100 feet, turn right. Okay. Continue for another mile. I'm fairly certain this isn't where I'm supposed to be. Okay, according to this, I should be able to go... You have arrived at your destination.. Bugger. This is just marvelous. Yes, thank you! Oh, for goodness sake. Put 'er down here. Thanks for the lift. Well, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. - All right. - The good news is... I don't see any major body damage, just a few scratches. Fantastic. What's the bad news? The entire undercarriage of your car is trashed. That is bad news. Can you fix it? No. This is a rental car. I'm not allowed to fix it. - So what now? - Well... they come and get it when they're good and ready. Marvelous. Is there another rental agency in town? Sorry, no. You're gonna have to take a train into the city and pick up another car there. It's just a couple hours away. I think I have a schedule around here somewhere. - Let me go check. - Thank you. I can come in later if you need me. - Okay. I'll see you there. - Okay, sounds good. I love you. Bye, Emma. Hey, where's Kenny hiding? He's... he's inside. Well, I'm selling Christmas bouquets to benefit the high school orchestra's trip to New York. Interested in buying one? Well, it looks like you're all sold out. No, silly. I don't carry them with me. You order them now, and then they'll be delivered right to your door on Christmas Eve. Well, I'd love to help, but I'm afraid I can't really use any. Really? I find it very hard to believe that someone like you doesn't have anyone they'd like to give some pretty flowers to. Someone like me, huh? I know someone who would love to get some beautiful flowers from someone like you on Christmas Eve. Well, in that case, maybe I'll take two. That'll be $50. Just make sure the right person gets them on Christmas morning. She will. So I have you down for two bouquets, Mister... David. Alice, you're not bugging my customer, are you? Not in the least. Looks like the next train isn't until tomorrow. Marvelous. Is there somewhere around here I can get a bite to eat and a cup of tea? There's a diner that's down the street to the right. They have the best food in town. Fantastic. Thank you. Thanks. What? You're not playing matchmaker with your sister, who's already tied up with Todd, are you? She was tied up, but now it's one of those... off-again, off-again kind of things. See you around. Denver omelet with hash browns smothered and covered! Thanks, Max. Don't look now, honey. Want me to shoo him out for you? No. It's my mess. I'll mop it up. Hey, Emma. What looks good today besides you? - Corned beef hash and eggs? - We're all out. Hey, wait. I think we should give this another chance. I mean, you've had a night to think about it, and you know that I'm the right guy for you, and you're the right girl for me. If you're not gonna order anything, I've got a restaurant to run. Hey, Emma, I didn't get my toast! Sorry, Jerry. I'm on it. Emma, please. Don't make the biggest mistake of your life. Everything you've ever wanted is standing in front of you. I really need to get back to work. Hey, just... I'll tell you what. Christmas is in seven days. Let's make it a merry one. No promises. Just think about it. I'll talk to you later. You don't think he's Mr. Right? He's Mr. Not Right Now. - I'm sorry. Didn't mean to... - It's okay. It's you. Me? I'm sorry, have we met? Over at the garage. You were across the road. - That was you. - Yeah. Well, just take a seat and someone will be right with you. Thank you. Emma, number three's ready for their order! I'm on it! Grits? Cheesy grits? Pigs in blankets, bacon waffles. Only in America. Welcome, Mister. You need a little time to look at the menu? There's a lot to choose from. What would you recommend? Everybody likes our biscuits and gravy. I'm sorry, biscuits and gravy? Yeah, biscuits and gravy. Oh, I see, I think perhaps we might call them scones. Well, why not? Let's try that. I don't suppose you have any Major's broken leaf? Tea? Be right back. - Thank you. - Coffee? No, thank you, Emma, I'll stick with tea. How'd you know my name? Well, I suppose everything about you just seems to say Emma. And it's on your name tag. I'm David. You're not from around here, are you, David? I didn't think it showed. No, I'm from Europe. Which country? Just Europe. It's really more like one ginormous country these days. Yeah, I read about that in the travel brochures. In the travel brochures? I plan to go there one day when I can. Well, you should. I think you'd love it. So what are you doing here? Did your car break down? In a manner of speaking, yes. I'll be taking the train out tomorrow. That's too bad. About the car. Yes. Well, it hasn't all been bad. Tasty, huh? Delicious. Well, let me know if there's something else I can get you. Thank you. Actually, seeing as you were kind enough to ask, I need a place to stay for the night. I mean a hotel, of course, not... Right. There's a bed and breakfast at the end of the street. Just take a right at Main Street. Thank you. Hi! Can I help you? Good afternoon, Nancy. I'd like a room, please. Absolutely. For how many nights? Just the one. I'm taking the train out tomorrow. Where are you headed? I suppose wherever the winds of fate take me. The winds of fate. I remember them. That's what brought me here. What happened? Two kids and mortgage. You'd be surprised. This town has a way of keeping people from leaving. Well, not me. Whatever you say. I'll need to see identification and a major credit card. Of course. Oh, my. I don't think I've ever seen a black one of those before. - Actually... - Is there a problem? Could I pay in cash instead? I only use this for the incidentals. Still, I'd rather just give you a deposit, if it's all the same. You're not in any kind of trouble, are you? No, not at all. I just like to avoid the foreign currency exchange rates. I see, sure. That'll be $85. Great. - And you're in 2B. - Thank you. You look familiar. Have you stayed with us before? First time in Aurora. Perhaps I just have one of those faces. Maybe that's it. Did you eat yet? I brought you something. Thanks, but I had some cereal. I'm not gonna let you become one of those kids. It's got protein! Peanuts? Peanuts count. So how was your day today? Interesting? I know what you mean. Come on, you've gotta admit. He was tall, handsome, and he's got that accent. Alice, I appreciate the thought. But really, what does anyone know about him? I know he wasn't wearing a ring. So? You have no idea what kind of dark secrets he might be hiding. Well, there's only one way to find out. I bet he comes back to the diner for breakfast tomorrow. Knock it off, Cyrano. Besides, you know I don't work tomorrow. Sorry. I wasn't thinking. What you reading? It's all about this mysterious nobleman who brings a single woman back to his elegant manor estate to become a governess for his young daughter. You'd wish this on me, wouldn't you? Doesn't this guy turn out to be a vampire? I just think it's interesting in that tall, dark and handsome comes to town just as you're breaking up with the Car King. It's like it was meant to be. Sorry. Not taking relationship advice from a 17-year-old. Remember, "Timing is everything, babe." Don't stay up too late reading that junk. It's not junk. It's Gothic romance. Checking out? Yes, thank you. Well, it was nice having you... Prince Duncan. I beg your pardon? I looked your name up from the credit card. I just knew you looked familiar. I just knew it! I'm afraid you must be mistaken. I never miss an issue. I see. Look, you mustn't tell a soul. Let me give you a little bit... No, no! Don't even! You're sure? Look, with as much as I love reading about this stuff, your secret is safe with me. However... if, when this is all over, maybe you could tell everyone about... The delightful little bed and breakfast I discovered here. That would be just wonderful. Of course. Hope to see you back again soon! We have a beautiful honeymoon suite! Just saying. They'll be delivered on Christmas Eve. Morning, Alice. How's sales going? As of today, I've sold six bouquets. Six? Well, you'll be well on your way to the Big Apple in no time at all. Thanks to people like you. Thought you had a train to catch. Well, I had a little time to kill. Coffee? When in Rome. So what time's your train? In a little while. Why do you ask? I just... I wouldn't want you to miss it. Well, thanks. I'm sure I'll be fine. So any exciting plans for the day? Nope, not me. And is your sister around at all? No, she... She's not working today. She never works on the 19th of December. That's rather a shame. I was hoping I might say goodbye. Well, that's nice. Thanks. You hungry? Famished. Want some pigs in a blanket? How many pigs are we talking here exactly? I'll have to look under the blanket. I have some good news for a change. Alice got accepted into State University. I know that's what you always hoped for. She's worked so hard for it. The only problem is... I'm a little short on cash right now, like $30,000 short. So I've had to make some really hard decisions. Please forgive me for what I'm about to do. Emma! David. - What are you doing here? - Well, I popped out for a walk, and I looked up, and there you were. I thought you had a train to catch. Oh, I do, but I had some time to kill, and I thought I might see something interesting. - And did you? - I think so. I'm sorry. I'm intruding. I should go. No, it's okay, I'm fine. You're sure? Well, in that case, I still have a couple of blocks left in me. Perhaps you might accompany me for a while. Sure. - Come on. - Great. This is Aurora. Four square blocks. Established in 1876. Population... Yeah. Well, I think it's rather beautiful. It's always been a family town. Folks spend their whole lives here. They're born here, married here, they raise their kids here. What about you? Born and raised. And your parents? I was just having a little chat with them before you came up. - I'm sorry. I didn't realize. - It's okay. So now it's just me and Alice. When we were little, our folks used to bring us here, and we'd all make snowmen and snow angels together. - I'm sorry, snow angels? - Oh, come on. Don't tell me you don't make snow angels where you come from. I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about. You're serious? My family's idea of the great outdoors was a tour of the Alps in a heated motor carriage. Wait, you've been to the Alps? Every spring without fail. And you've never made a snow angel? I'm afraid that singular pleasure has eluded me. That's just... unacceptable. I quite agree. Let's fix that. Great. What do I do? Okay, stand here. - Drop your bag. - Okay. Close your eyes tight. Stick your arms out like a bird. - I feel quite ridiculous. - Perfect. Chin up. What now? Wha... Was that absolutely necessary? Now I want you to wave them like this. There! You're doing it! I'm doing what? I'm making a snow angel? The best ever. I can't believe you never played in the snow when you were a kid. I've played in the snow. Snowball fights? Ice sports? Huh, huh? Not exactly. I was captain of the curling team when I was at university though. Curling? That sounds like some pretty serious stuff, buster. I'll have you know it's very serious. All designed to keep up the family honor, of course. I seemed to have spent so much of my time appeasing them. I've never really had the opportunity to do my own thing. To take risks, to have a meaningful relationship. You know, I've never even been in love. And I was feeling sorry for me. You trust me? I don't know. Should I? Absolutely not, but you're gonna. Here we go again. Okay, I just want you to relax. Okay. Just loosen up and hold on, okay? You've seriously never done this before? Like I said, my parents are rather on the conservative side. Well, you said you wanted to take a risk, right? Yeah. You're not worried, are you? Hurtling down a mountainside in a runaway sleigh with nothing to stop us but some bloody large trees, what's to worry? Glad you feel that way. Pass me your phone. In case we don't make it, smile! In case we... Oh, jeez. Ready? - One... - All right. ...two... three! Oi! David! David, are you okay? David? Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. Just an old injury flaring up. I wouldn't normally mention it, but I served a couple of years in the military. Really? How did that happen? National service. It's mandatory in my country, regardless of what your parents think is best for you. So you were like a commando or something? No. I was a cornet in the cavalry. A cornet. Second lieutenant on horseback. That's what I said. Cupcakes. Why not? Two coffees and two buttercreams. - Thanks, Wendy. - You got it. I'm glad I took the time to check out your little town. It's everything you said it would be. I wouldn't steer you wrong, unless I had more time. You know with the snow and the icicles and all the little lights, you must have had some truly magical Christmases here. We used to. Not so much lately. You know how it is. You just don't always have a lot of time to celebrate. Well, you run your own business. I'm sure it takes a lot. The diner was my father's dream. But now it barely makes enough to keeps the lights turned on. But I've been determined to keep Dad's dream alive. And at what cost to your own dreams? And Alice? Doesn't she want to have a proper Christmas? She does. And she will. Thank you. But what I really want is to see what life is like in other places. It must be so fascinating, different. I mean, I love this little town, I do, but I know that there's this big old world out there waiting for me. I wish that I could show you that world. I guess you missed your train. There'll be another one. So can I see you again tomorrow? Maybe. Here we are. She's very pretty, isn't she? Yeah, she is. Very. Someone looks happy. I think you might be confusing happiness with sheer terror. Tell me, is there something going on here? I don't know. I'm kinda new at all of this. I don't think my timing was terrific with today being, you know... I know. Her parents were good people. It's so sad. What happened to them? It was a car accident four years ago today. They had just bought their Christmas tree, and they were driving home, and they hit a patch of black ice. Emma and Alice were pretty banged up, but Bruce and Julie didn't make it. How terrible. It's always hard to lose a parent, but to lose both of them in that way at Christmastime? It's just tragic. I had no idea. And now Emma's raising her sister Alice. Yeah. She's put her entire life on hold to take care of her little sister. That and keeping her father's diner open. That's what drives her every day. Emma is a remarkable girl. So how do you know her? We met at the diner. She showed me around this afternoon. Would that have something to do with why you missed your train today? It might have something to do with that, yes. Now I know this is none of my business, but... let's just say, hypothetically, someone were interested in Emma, and they asked my advice. Go on. Well, with everything that she's been through, I think she would really appreciate it if someone were to offer her some help for a change. Hypothetically. Of course. Thanks for the tea. Your Majesty? Anything? He's still here. - What about the train? - He never boarded. Why not? I'd venture to say he was highly distracted. What kind of distraction? 5'8", blue eyes. Good work, Geoffrey. Would you like me to intervene, sir? No, don't rush him, not yet. Just stand close by in case he needs you. And be sure to report to me. Very well. What about the queen? Let's just keep this between ourselves for now. Understood, Your Majesty. And good night. Yes, good night. There you are, my love. Is there any news on Duncan? No, my love, nothing yet. I know. It's all my fault. I've driven him away. It's as simple as that. A wedding of this magnitude would be stressful on anyone. It wouldn't be a wedding of this magnitude if it wasn't for me. I mean, you only get married once, and I just wanted this to be the most perfect wedding, and now we have everything at stake. Ariana... they're just titles, that's all. I was Duncan's age once, and I know what he's going through. He just needs time, that's all. Really? Don't think I didn't have reservations, even about our wedding. That's true. And we worked out all right, didn't we? Yes, we did. And that's because no one made us get married. We got married because we wanted to. And I promise you all will be well and Duncan will come home. He'd certainly better. I have a delivery. These are gorgeous. Let me see. They're for you! From you know who! "I know you need your time to think, but don't take too long. Only five days until Santa leaves you under my tree. Love, Todd." Okay. Take these. Good morning. I'm beginning to think you don't actually have a train to catch at all. Why is there a "for sale" sign outside? I guess it's time to wake up and realize I can't keep going like this. - The money would come in handy. - Maybe I can help you. - What? - Emma, it's Christmas. This place should be packed. And, really, it's deader than Mother's Day at an orphanage. What I'm trying to say is that perhaps selling the diner isn't the only option. Maybe we could liven things up a little bit. We could at least try. We? Yes. Let me introduce your customers to some new dishes, something a little bit out of the box. What do you have to lose? - You're serious. - Absolutely. All right. What do you have in mind? Here's what I was thinking. Here you go. Everything on your list, except for suet. Nobody here knows what suet is. Okay, well, thanks for trying, Max. I am dying to see what you're gonna do with all this stuff. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. Do you have a passion for international cuisine? I like cooking for people, if that's what you mean. This burger flipping is only temporary until I open my own place. Really? Your own place? It'll be the only gourmet restaurant in all of Aurora. But first I gotta pass the entrance exam to get into culinary school. What's stopping you? Unfortunately, school learning was never my thing, so here I am slinging omelets. I can help you, if you'd like. Do you have the time? I'll make time. - Six. - Exactly. You know the best piece of advice anyone every gave me? Trust your instincts. You've got this, Max. I'm almost afraid to ask. David's helping me on my entrance exam. Is that right? Okay, what about the next one? 24. Wait. 34. Good, and remember you have to include that in your table. Don't worry, David. I got this. You gotta pound it. Come on, pound it. Pound it, explode it, and let it rain down. I'll work on it. Come on. You've played this before. Your turn. I'm not really sure that... Come on, you have to have played pool before. Well, where I come from, we might call it snooker. Shut up and shoot. Okay. Come on, come on come on, come on... You can't rush me. This is a very precise sport. I don't know what kind of snooker you've been playing. That was what you might call a warm-up shot. Sure. Here, watch this. That was a lucky shot. Who's the new guy? Towed him in a couple days ago. Did a number on his rental car. You're holding it all wrong. Here. It has to go between these two fingers. Like that. Can't shoot or drive, huh? You gonna let the girl show you how to play? - Go away, Todd. - No. No, I wanna see Doctor Who here sink a shot. Emma, come on. You cannot seriously be interested in Mr. Fancy Pants. I believe the lady asked you to go away. Believe whatever you want, pal. - Just stay out of my way. - Todd, please. Why don't you just walk away? Or what? You're gonna throw me out? Yeah, if I have to. You're embarrassing yourself, Todd. Did Emma happen to mention to you that she's engaged to be married? We are not engaged. We will be on Christmas. So why don't you just, you know, bugger off? That's what you people call it, right? Okay. I've had enough of you, thank you. Not your fight. Come on, put your fists up and stand still. Let's go! Like this? Show him, Todd! This really might be none of my business, but you mind explaining what just happened? Todd's not a bad guy. He's just hurt. And that makes a man crazy sometimes. So you actually went out with that guy. I did. We grew up together. When you live in a small town like this, you'll find there aren't a lot of fish in the sea. So... settling becomes a real thing. Emma, do you hear yourself? I know. It's just... After awhile you realize that... no one's gonna show up on a white horse and sweep you off your feet. There is no Prince Charming. Emma. Yeah? Fairy tales do come true... sometimes. Not for me they don't. I have a few big decisions to make. For Alice's sake, I'm gonna make them. There's no rush, Emma. You have everything going for you. You're young, you're beautiful. Don't make a decision now that you're gonna regret. That's easy for you to say. The jet-setting around the globe, the fencing, the curling. You have it pretty good. And I would change it all for a normal life. - Yeah, right. - I'm serious. You know, this town... the snow, the lights... the people. The snow melts, David. The lights come down. It's all just an illusion. Nancy told me about your parents. Blabbermouth. Emma, you are capable of so much, and when I hear you talking about settling, all I can think is that world out there will never get to see what you have to offer. Look, I have Alice's college fees to think about, my parents' mortgage to pay off, and a failing business to unload. Maybe I don't get to dream anymore. Have you ever thought about that? No. Maybe I should have. Do you trust me? You wanna get even, don't you? Look, just let me pick you up at 5:00 tomorrow. Bye, Emma. - Emma? - In here! So how did it go yesterday? What's that? Look, I know you're only 17, but I think you can figure this one out for yourself. I mean, how did it get in here? I was thinking about what you said. You're right. It's just a tree. Did David talk you into this? No. Maybe. You wanna help me finish decorating? Yeah! Hold on, prince! Whatever happened to just passing through and going where fate takes you? Believe it or not, I think this is where fate took me. Besides, you were the one who said Emma might appreciate a little more help. I was thinking more along the lines of a gift card for a massage or something. Well, next time you might be a little more specific. Well, it sounds like things are heating up with you and David. I like him. He's different. You know I've never met anyone quite like her before. - He's polite. - The girls back home, certainly the ones that I go out with, are just so... Proper? Dull. But Emma, you know, she's different. She's smart, she's funny, she's independent. - Cultured. - Free-spirited. - Chivalrous. - Sharp as a tack. - Considerate. - Selfless. Well traveled. - Hard working. - Mature. She even drinks beer and plays snooker. He said he wants to surprise me later. So what's the problem? I can't stay forever. I have to go home soon. When he leaves, it'll be back to Todd and monster truck rallies. Look, I never thought Mom and Dad would be gone. Who knows how long anyone has? Whatever time it is, however long it lasts, just enjoy it. You promise? I've been looking all over for you! Is something the matter? Actually... 85. I passed! - What? - I took the test last night, and they e-mailed me the results this morning. I'm in! Fantastic, Max, well done! I couldn't have pulled it off without you, bro. Well, I only pointed you in the right direction. You did the rest yourself. Yeah. Guess I did, didn't I? Come on, bro, bang it! Close enough. Okay. Actually, listen, I'm glad you're here. I was wondering if I might recruit your help for a little something. Sure, what do you need? Well, you know Emma's sister Alice? - Of course. - Okay, listen to me. Alice. Come on in. Is the lady of the house at home? That depends. Is that for me? I'm afraid not. But that one is. Alice! You look enchanting. Thank you. You look pretty good yourself. Thank you. A Christmas tree. All set? Lead the way. Oh, my goodness. I don't know what to make of all this. It's like something out of a fairy tale. Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale. Your carriage awaits. This is amazing. I've always wanted to come here, but we could never afford it. Well, it came highly recommended. Tonight the whole restaurant is yours. You can't mean that. I thought seeing as you've never traveled the world, I might try and bring the world to you. But why? Every girl deserves to feel like a princess at least once in her life. I'd say you're way overdue. I love it. What happens next? Well, perhaps you should ask the chef. Oh, my! We'll begin with a smoked haddock soup served with poached egg, followed by gravlax served chilled with toast points. You made all that yourself? I gave Max a few of my old family recipes. And for our main course, braised loin of veal stuffed with a black truffle dressing with a warm béchamel sauce on the side. - Enjoy. - Thank you. I don't know what to say. Well, where words fail, music speaks. Oh, my goodness! What do you think? This is wonderful. No one's ever done anything like this for me before. Cheers. I feel like I'm dreaming. You know, sometimes dreams do come true. What are you trying to say? I'm just glad you like it. Can I help you with something, Todd? You can. Is that foreign guy still staying here? He is. I'd like to have a word with him. Okay. I'll check and see if he's here. But I don't want any trouble, you hear? I hear. He's not here. Todd? Thank you for everything. Anytime. Thank goodness you're home. What's up with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. It's kind of important. All right. Good night. Night. Well, horse, that certainly ended well. What are you doing here? I didn't see your car. I parked around back. Emma, you better sit down. I hope there's a point to all this secrecy. How much do you really know about this guy David? Or shall I say Prince Duncan Humphries of Balemont. What? It gets better. Look at this. He's getting married in a few days. No. Emma, I am so, so sorry. This is all my fault. If I'd never pushed you, if... if I hadn't sent him to the diner that day. He said his parents were strict. They had a family business. But this... He's just out for one last fling before tying the knot. Get out of my house. Hey. Christmas is just a few days away... Get out! You're gonna look foolish. Emma... I need to be alone. Good morning! Today's breakfast special will be a proper international affair with poached eggs, kippers... Save it, Duncan. So you know. Emma, I am sorry. Is that the best you got? I wanted to tell you. Tell me what? That you lied about who you are? I never said I wasn't a prince. You got some nerve. No, you just left out a few minor details. Family business? I thought you were different. I trusted you! Please, allow me to explain. You're getting married on Christmas Day? When were you gonna tell me about that? After you'd had your little fun here? Look, I know that this looks bad. Emma, I'm sorry. I truly, truly am. And the truth is that, yes, I haven't been entirely forthcoming with you. But I wanted to tell you. Honestly, I did. You have to believe me that I left home because I couldn't bear being forced into a marriage with a woman that I didn't love! I came here to escape all of that. Escape? I never expected to fall in love here. But I did. By the time that I realized, I couldn't figure out a way to tell you the truth without... Hurting me. I wanted to tell you so many times. And how long would it have been until you needed to escape from me? It's not like that at all. If I told you who I was, would you have treated me the same? How would I ever know that you cared about me for who I am? You're a prince. You live in a castle. You own your own country. You were never gonna settle down here. - Emma, please! - Shouldn't you be going? I'm sure you've got a lot of important things to do, like planning a royal wedding. Don't let it end like this. How foolish do I look now? Two men in my life, and the honest one turns out be the used car salesman. What are the chances? I think you should leave. If that's what you really want. All the best at school, Max. So this is where you've been hiding. Very quaint. Geoffrey. Your closet back at the palace is bigger than this. How did you find me? Well, you're not exactly a master spy. Using cash was a good idea. Paying for the rental car with a credit card, not so much. Do my parents know? Well, your father's been keeping up. And for the record, he's been very supportive. He understands you better than you think, Duncan. I'm sorry about the young lady. She seems very nice. You know about that too. Come on, matey. I think it's time to go home. I think you might be right. Well, the good news is we were able to get everything back on track. Jolly good. What about the guests? Yes, well, we did lose a few of the politicians, and the American president ended up booking a golf holiday instead. But for the most part, we're all set. And best of all, our ratings are off the chart. Excellent. What say you, Duncan? How was your trip to America, darling? It was... character building. May I be excused? Yes, certainly. What are you doing? - What does it look like? - We have staff for this. Let them enjoy their dinner, for goodness sake. - Nonsense! - They haven't anywhere to sit. Please, guys, go and finish eating in the dining room. In the royal dining room? I don't dare, sir. Please, I insist. Go and finish eating in the royal dining room. Thank you, sir. You are a prince, and you better start acting like one! And how is that exactly? Rude? Entitled? I was happy in Aurora. People liked me not because of a crown or because they were supposed to, but because of who I am inside. I don't love Isabelle, and I never have. And your mega wedding isn't gonna change that. Duncan's right, Ariana. We've been fortunate. But we can't expect him to be happy just because we were. Sometimes we have to listen to our hearts. You know, Emma might not be a duchess, and maybe she didn't go to Oxford, but she is the smartest, hardest working, most independent, free-spirited woman I've ever met. And the truth is that I am in love with her. Then why are you standing here? You should be with her. It would be cruel to keep you apart. I don't know. She was pretty hurt when she found out the truth about me. Well... it didn't stop you before. At least give it a try. What have you got to lose? Don't worry. I'll call Isabelle's family. I'll let them down gently. Thanks, Mom. Cheers, Dad. Better get your skates on. Our little boy. If you want something, make it quick 'cause I'm closing up early today. Can you at least try to cheer up? It's Christmas Eve. Sorry. Just got a lot of stuff on my mind. You gotta stop thinking about him. Turns out he has a crazy half-cousin locked in a tower room. You were right. He did turn out to be a vampire. He turned out to be a prince. He had some wild oats. And he would've sowed them, too, if he hadn't been tripped up. That's all there is to it. But he said that he loved you. Men say a lot of things. Did you love him back? Yeah. I did. How do you know it was really love and not just the fancy restaurant and the cool accent? It was like every time we were together, I never wanted it to end. Never wanted to say goodbye. Just wanted to keep going, never stop. Emma, what if he felt the same way that you did? I guess I'll never know. It's funny. Every schoolgirl dreams of being Cinderella, falling in love with her Prince Charming. I actually meet him, and I throw him out with the trash. There. I said it. - Happy? - Ecstatic. Now if you don't mind, you're supposed to drive me over to the train station. Train station? My flowers. They come in today. We're supposed to pick them up, remember? I completely forgot. Sorry. Good thing you came by. Timing is everything, babe. Can't wait to see the flowers. I wonder where we go. Well, I think that's the freight car. Oh, come on. Maybe it's this one. Flower delivery! Hi. Thank you. Here, I'll help. They're beautiful. You did good, kid. Emma. Emma. I've come to collect. What? I paid for two bouquets of flowers. When the royal family pays for something, we always collect. Oh, well, you're just in time. You can take your pick. I already made my decision. I choose the rose standing in front of me. You can do better than me. Not if I searched in a thousand summer gardens. The rose I desire flowers only in the snow. I love you, Emma. And I believe you love me too. This is our chance. We have to take it. Do you love me? Yes. But I can't do this. I have to think about Alice. To heck with Alice! College doesn't even start till next fall. Well, I believe you have your bridesmaid, and I have my best man. My train leaves in 30 minutes. What do you say? No. What do you say? I love you, Emma. Will you marry me? Yes. FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
