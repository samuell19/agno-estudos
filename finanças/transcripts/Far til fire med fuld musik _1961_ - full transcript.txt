Howdy! Then we get up from the warm blanket! Out of bed, sleepyhead! Whoa! I fooled you there. (laughs) (laughs) Then we get up! Up with you, little Sis. Up with you, Peter. - Your robber. - Oh no. Now you have woken him up. There... Ouch! (children's cry) Are you going to visit mom and dad? - A Mardi Gras troll. - You little bun. Can you smile a little? Also a little for dad. Smile a little at dad. Well, look. Up, up, you lazy body! I'll give you, you little worm. You can just wait, can you! - Then they are up. The whole bundle. - It was good, Little Per. Hurry up and get in the clothes. Mrs. Sejersen is coming. - Have you invited her? - No. She has invited herself. She has baked Mardi Gras buns. - To all of us? - Yes. Then it is at an angle. (the rustle of cans) Well, then have a bun. And then they are warm. Those kids, those kids. (the children plays "It's summer...") Per, Per, now come out. Now get out on the road. Per, Per, now come out. We are here with the wagon. Yes, now I'm coming. (the children laughs) Don't hush with a much older lady. (laughing) (the children laughs) There is absolutely nothing to laugh about. My Goodness. I dropped my hat. Hello, everyone. Where are they going? - To uncle Anders. - And beat the cat off the barrel. - He has been anticipating all week. - That he wants to. - He is a child friend. - Yes, he has nothing else to do. You don't have to be so superior. We are going to a party ourselves tonight. - There is a ball at school. - With our own orchestra. No, it was funny though. a little song with the sound of the city, we play with full music ding, ding, push, push pling, pling, honk, honk a little song with thu and bang from the city in your traffic ding, ding, push, push, we're playing well honk, honk a little song with the sound of the city, we play with raised mood ding, ding, push, push pling, pling, honk, honk a little song with tju and bang we play while we drive ding, ding, push, push, this is going well honk, honk (gunshot) (parrot laughs) (Uncle Anders hums) now we have to party and the sky is blue it's nice to see that the sun shines...

Mardi Gras is my name, buns I want if I don't get any buns, I make trouble buns up and buns down, buns in my stomach if I don't get any buns, I make trouble It's festive. Welcome, little children. Come closer. It's funny. Strike it, children! Strike it! - Toes boys. - You can be that yourself. - Sissy boys. - You can be that yourself, shut up! Yes! - There it was. - Long live the cat king.

When it's Leif, you can expect a bit of everything. si, si, si yes, yes, yes (applause) - What would you prefer. A sausage or something to drink? - Thank you, both. But shouldn't we help with the musicians? They are probably thirsty. - Then there is champagne for everyone. - Thank you, Leif. Cheers. - Here you go, principal. - Thank you, Miss Ludvigsen. They play magnificently, the rascals. Ole has taken shape of that orchestra. When that boy sets his mind to something, he carries it out. - Is it a cha-cha-cha? - Yeah. Aah, these dynamic Latin rhythms are not to be missed, are they? No, maybe. But aren't they a bit noisy? No, the deep gurgling of the bongo drums is magnificent. Oh? Yes. Yes. - We'll have a beer afterwards. - Yes, now we can see. (clap) Now I think we should have an old fashioned lady inclination. (cheers) Well, there he slipped. - Who? - Leif. - I don't really care. - Yes, you can clearly see that. I'm going to get something in my coat. Come. - At least it's mine. - It was worse. And then I have this one. It's yours, Uncle Anders. (sobs) (crying) (hulks) (hulks) "Saturday evening: School prom." "Oh, how I rejoice. It will probably be a lovely evening." What is it made of? Why are you sitting there hooting? - I'm not crying. - You're splashed in the face. - What's the matter, little Mie? - Nothing. - What's his name this time? - What are you saying? Yes. When you sit and drool over your diary, - - then it is usually because there is a sheik in the water. - Do you want a candy? - Yes, please. (sighs) - Why is life so complicated? - What do you say, little Mie? I say: "Why is life so complicated?" - It is difficult to answer. - Yes. I think you have to live life completely alone. Yes. - And don't get involved in anything. - No. By the way, I think I messed up in something. - But Per! What kind of thing? - Come. Come. Nah, how sweet they are! I've been lucky there, huh? Where did you get them from? Has the mother run away? No, I got them from Jens because Joergensen got kittens. - It's the mother. - Is her name Joergensen? That was before they knew he was a female cat. - And now Jens' father wants to drown them. - That would be a shame. How do they get food? Where is Joergensen? Over at Jens's. We go back and forth three times a day. It is fireproof. - You can't have them here, dad will be livid. - What should we do then? - We have to find a place in the cellar. - Yes. - Do you have anything to put over them? - Yes, this one. There. - You, Mie... - Ssh! It was mine, then. - (meow) - Do you sit and meow? Well, God knows I won't. - (meow) - There you were again. May I be free! I'm not an animal impersonator. - Spade! - Clubs! (laughing) (sighs) What a weather. Good morning, Per. Where are you going? I have to pick up the Sunday newspaper for dad. (baby cry) Mother's little thing. You have become so heavy and so big. - Hold him just a moment. - Come to dad. Daddy's Big Boy? No, look there. Now he has soap all over his face. You can get a little with it. (laughing) (hums) - Good morning, father. Here you go. - Thank you, my boy. Well, well. Good weather today. Good morning, father. Can I borrow the sports pages? Sport? Yes, rather than like. Here you go. Dad, my football boots won't last any longer. Then you'll have to kick a little less in the future, my friend. - Are you going to train today? - Yes. - Could one be allowed to come along? - I have to think about it. We had a fun match on Friday. We beat the star club 4-1! So, so, so. We're not deaf. - I wonder where the others are? - There we have them. Good morning. Oh, grandpa's little rascal. Auntie Mie's little squeaky troll. Yes, and Uncle Per's own little Peeing Frederik. Shame on you, Per. You don't say something like that. Can't you stop your little squeaky troll and squeezy racscal? I think Peter is right. Now you must see to getting that boy baptized. - What is he going to be named? - We have talked about Holger and Sigfred. - And Peter. - Nothing to do with Peter here. Couldn't we call him after dad? - don't talk about. May I be free. - That would be bomb fun. Yes. Don't you, little Albinus? So, so, so. It's not that funny either. - Call him Knud. - Knud? Why? - After Knud Lundberg. Or Harald. - No, rather Dario. - I think his name should be Anders. - After Uncle Anders? No, after Donald Duck. (laughter) Hello, hello. Is anyone home here? Goodmorning everybody. - Is that you, Uncle Anders? - Yes, bursting with news. Nah... There we have the little wool bun mullet man. - You'd better not call him that. - We are talking about what his name should be. - I know that. - Couldn't you explain that? - Now I have to, uncle Anders. - Now you just have to see. I have received a letter from my brother Sofus in Texas. He offers the little guy there $1,000. So, so, so. "Take it easy." If he is named after him. Sofus? - Should he be called Sofus? - Yes. - How much money was it? - $1,000, my friend. - Then there is nothing to fuss about. - No. - I think Per is right. - Well? Well, we'll say it. - Right, Sis? - Yeah. Get yourself a cup of coffee, my friend. I'll be right there. Thank you my sweet girl. - I have to get over training. - May I come along? - And what? - I want to learn to play football. - It's not something for sissies. - There are teams for smaller boys. - When I started, I was only six. - Have you played football? On top of that, I was on the city team. - Was it six years old, you said? - Yes. - Stop. - When Anders says it, it fits. I now think Per should be allowed to play football. Who hides kittens in the basement? - It is me. - Is it you? - You gave me permission yourself. - Have I? - Yes, to have small animals down there. - I thought you meant worms. Kittens are also small. - Where do they come from? - Well, where do such small one come from? - (Anders laughs) - So, Anders! In any case, they must be drowned. - We can't have that mess here. - Shouldn't I keep them? Don't talk about. So, done! - Do you want to drown them? - Me? Yes, of course. - But not today? On a Sunday? - Then we wait until tomorrow. Do you want to put them back down? Listen, what is it? - One is missing. Anders? - Yes? - Then bring it. - What do you say? There you go. (Anders sighs) Besides, father-in-law, there was another thing we were talking about. - Per wants to play football. - Isn't it enough, Ole is playing an idiot? - He was supposed to play football, not an idiot. - And why? Because it is healthy to play sports. Yes, and as a little encouragement instead of that with the kittens. - Who must now be drowned. - Can I not, father? Yes, yes, I give up. Let him play where and when he wants. - Only I have to find peace. - Cheers! - Well, how did it go? - Fine. I got on the sandbox team. - Congratulations, little soccer player. - Now it's about using the legs. - He will probably be sold to Italy. - Then you will get a lot of money for me. - They will only give 50 cents for you. - "Wait and see." See him there. This is Mister, our trainer. Deadly fast. I have to see to get started. - Goodbye, Uncle Anders. And thanks. - I'll stay a while and watch. You don't have to stay very long. No, I just want to see that you get off to a good start. Gather around! Hello, everyone. Are they fresh and well-groomed? Soeren and Jens pick up the bag with the prunes. Leif and Christian see to it that the poles are put up over there. - Is your name Per? - Yes. Just line up between the others. - Is it yours? - No, I'm just Uncle Anders. - Will you stay and watch? - With pleasure. I am an old football player myself. From when I was six years old, even. - But now I have stopped. - Do stay and watch. I was on the city team! Give us the balls. Leave the balls and be quiet. And then we line up two by two. Here you go. Overhead with you guys. Over kicking. And you header too. Over kicking with you guys. And you header too. - You, shall we fight? - Why? - Why shouldn't we? - Oh yeah. So, Claus! Are you fighting again? Go away. And Per, you are new. Let's come and play with the prunes. (laughing) And then down over there. (whistle) (whistle) Faster. Faster. Fine. Shoot, Per. The ball doesn't hurt you. I can do it! Well done, Uncle Anders! - Hey. Do you want to join? - No thanks. - What are you about to do? - Go for a walk. Do you want to go when you can drive with me? Yes, I would like to. - Maybe you're mad at us? - No. But why that? - She might be scared. - Stop it, you two. What would Mie be afraid of? Jump in. (music from the radio) - Where are we going? - nowhere. Just drive. Gorgeous, isn't it? - Is that your father's car? - Do you think I want drive in that old bucket? It's my brother Hugo's. - Leif, do you have a driver's license? - Are you crazy? I am not yet 18. Well, you can't drive if you don't have a driving license! It's going quite well, isn't it, honey? - Leif, you mustn't drive so fast. - Well, I have to see. It is Hoersholmvej. - Go slower, please. I'm afraid. - You can see there. I won. We bet a flight like that would blow your mind. How insidious and disgusting you are. Stop! Do you hear? I want to leave. Impossible, honey. Does not stop before Helsingor. (screams) (squealing tires) - Damn us! - I don't want to participate anymore! - Mie, come here! - No thanks, I'll take the bus home! - Oops! What is that for? - Let's see get away. Car hoodlums! Oops! Wait for me! - It was a severe sprint. - Yes. Thank you. - You are welcome. - Hey, it doesn't go north, does it? - Yes, it will do. - But I'm going to Lyngby. - Well? That's where I come from. - What do I do now? They get off at the next stop and take the bus in the opposite direction. Oh yeah. Of course. I guess I'm a little confused. - Do you live in Lyngby? - I am a football coach down on the field. Well, I have two brothers. Ole and Per. Ole and Per? I know them well. - The weather is otherwise fine today. - Yes, but kind of up and down. - Then it's hot, and then it's cold. - Yes, or vice versa. - Now you have to leave. The bus is coming. - Thanks. Goodbye. Is the count at home? Good day. - Good day, Uncle Anders. - Good day, little lady. - Isn't he cute? - The dear little bandit. I actually think he looks like me. That is, if he had beard. Well, shall we drive now? We are going over to say hello to Peter. He is on duty at the hospital today. Listen, by the way, tell the doctor, I'll have some invigorating pills. You probably don't need that. Per! Per, where are you? - Good day, Anders. - Is there something wrong? Wrong? Here he comes home with a grade book which... It's also all that football nonsense. Per! Per! - Is it me you're calling, father? - Yes. There's something we need to talk about. - What's wrong? - Quietly. The old one is not really in the mood today. Don't you read your homework? What kind of characters are these? And here: "Snarky in the geography class." He was the new teacher. A lazy toad who asked, - - how to know the earth was round. Then I said he could just look at a globe. Yes, Per is indeed right. And here. Ancient knowledge: tg. Oh? Yes. Yes. - But here: "Inattentive in Danish class." - We just sat and talked. - About what? - A Window maker What does a Window maker do when he has no glass? - Yes, what is he doing? - He drinks from the bottle. It was fireproof. I must remember that. There is nothing to laugh at. There is no more seriousness in this world. No respect. No sense of duty. Just play ball with it all. But not here! - But you have to have a little fun. - Not for my money. People should not be continuously billed for broken windows. It's just Mrs Sejersen. She is so scared of chickens when we play. - We have never broke anything of hers. - You better not dare! - I'm busy. - Maybe you're going to drown kittens? What? Yes. That means no. I do not have time. I have to catch the bus. - Anders, are you staying for dinner? - Yes, thank you, very much so. Oh. It was nice then. - Father is not so bad. - He's good enough. At the bottom, yes. He just doesn't want to know. - Didn't you bring a football? - Yes, but now it's probably out of the question. - Well, that's fine. - Shouldn't we try it? Yes, yes then. We give it a little kick. (howl) What is it? Uncle Anders. Down with you. Per! Ole! Better come forward. I know very well that it is the two of you. Are you listening? Emerge! You should be ashamed! - Come on, Uncle Anders. We slip. - No, no, no. One must stand by what you have done. I'm going in there. - Good day, little Mrs. Sejersen. - What do you mean? Have you known the like? The two boys are not to be controlled. But they must be clapped off. It's not the boys at all. It was me who cracked the window. But I will see to it that a new one is put in immediately. - Do you play football? - I was very talented in my youth. I was on the city team. I must try to get hold of that Window-Maker. Do you know what a Window Maker does when he has no windows? Yes. I guess he plays spades. - Here you go. - Thanks. (music from record player) You, Ole? Come, you must see. - It looks nice, huh? - Yes, it's smart with those girls' clothes. Think where they get looked around. Some have been to Cannes. And those who must go to Scotland. It's just right for me. You only play the piano. You can't run around with that. No, but I can take the lead and swing this thing. - Well, you want to be drum major. - Yes, exactly. - They are looking for a reserve. - So just keep going. - Mie, why are you so mad at Leif? - Am I? That's what he says. What is it? He is so good at giving out. - Yes, he always wades in money. - Is there something wrong with that? No, but I don't like him anymore and you should stay away from him. Nonsense, Mie. He's good enough. A little naughty, maybe. He is an untrustworthy, cold and ruthless guy. And dangerous. (it rings) Now what is that? - Is there anyone at home? - Not me. I wanted to take you to the cinema. "Gasoline in the blood." Awesome movie. No, thank you. - Then maybe Ole will? - Ole works. Fine. Then I stick up there. (squeals) (knocks) - Hi, Leif. - Do you want to go to the cinema? No not tonight. I sit and hump with these assignments. Yes, I have given them up. Would you like a cigarette? - I have stopped. It's so expensive. - Then keep the package. - Thank you. - There are more where they came from. - How is it with a beer? - A beer? I'm sorry I don't have that. I thought so. Then it's a good thing that I have beer myself. - You are not quite ordinary. - No, fortunately. Then life wasn't worth living. Cheers, you. Cheers. Someone must have made it to the front page, huh? "Youth gangs at play again." "It is especially in the surrounding municipalities that they operate." The other day it was the railway kiosk they were after. - They're tough, those guys. - Yes, and bold. Otherwise, they didn't get anything out of it. Yes, the excitement, and that's the best part of it all. But sooner or later things go wrong. I wasn't supposed to enjoy anything. Why not, Ole? That's interesting, you. - What do you mean, Leif? - Can you keep a secret? It's me and a few other guys who make these little numbers. - You? - Yeah, you were impressed there, huh? Yes, that's good with you. - You don't believe me? - No. - Do you want to see the case? - Yes, please. Do you know Grocer Rasmussen's business? The one on the corner. Then it will be there tomorrow evening at nine o'clock. Exact. (laughing) - And didn't say a word to anyone, right? - No. Mie! - Mie! - What is it? See! We have been photographed. The whole sandbox team. That's me with the ball there. And this is Mister, our trainer. - He's handsome, isn't he? - Yes, you can greet him from me. - He doesn't know you. - Yeah. Greet him from the girl from the bus. The girl from the bus? Yes. Sofus must wear it tomorrow. This is our baptism dress. - Ours? - Yes, we've all worn it. - Father was the first. - Dad? He can't be in that. - Yes, when he was little, you fool. - He must have looked funny, huh? - Was he also wearing the cap? - Yes, and you were wearing it too. - lh, where you screamed in church. - Yes, with the girl-clothes. (it rings) Now I have to. Hi, Jens. - What are you laughing at? - Of you. It is the family's baptistery. I had to say hello from dad and say thank you for the loan. - Well, you remembered the kittens. - I hope they can drink themselves soon. - Joergensen runs out again. - Well. lh, how they grow. Yes, now they are almost too big for your father to drown them. Come, let's go down to the cellar. - Here you go. It just fits. - Thanks. - Sissy boy. - What? He's in a real Sunday mood today. Bye. Bye. (rings) Hey, Uncle Anders. - Good day, little Mrs. Sejersen. - But God, have you brought the animal with you? I thought it was a shame it had to sit alone at home. - Is there coffee? - Be now quiet. - I put it right out in the kitchen. - Yes, do that. - It's boiling over! It boils over! - What nonsense, silly bird. - Haven't they come from church yet? - We can expect them at any moment. (it rings) There they are. Well, there we have our little Sofus. lh, where he howled in the church. - How hungry I am. - The food is ready. - I just want to go upstairs with him. - Now I have to take him. Aah, where is he? (hits the glass) A day like today is a day of joy for all of us. Such a little boy is a great gift. When I stand here as a grandfather, I can first thank little Sis. Yes, and Peter too. - Yes, Peter. - Peter? Yes, of course also Peter. (laughter) And I wish you both the best of luck with the little clan lord. And to you, Mrs. Sejersen, I want to thank you for the food and drink - - and the festively covered table with stork and all. Yes, a stork is needed. He is the one who brings the little ones. - Ha! - Ssh. Shall we spend a living for Sofus and hope we have a nice day? - Long live Sofus! - Not so loud. Then you just wake him up. - Long live Sofus. - Hooray, hooray, hooray. - Hooray!!! - So, Anders. cheers... dad, you are the best friend we have perhaps a little grumpy in the morning, but... immediately cheerful again we know that father, when the morning coffee is first ready then you smile, even though you have to fight with kids like us pocket money, that's what we get union tariff but who helps us when we need a bit for a cinema trip? Dad, because you're always so nice there is not one who has such a lovely father evening time, the happy hours with domestic comfort we can all laugh the day passed, the family gathers about the centerpiece of the home in a sweet harmony dad... ... you cozying with your cigar your armchair and your newspaper is your paradise we know that dad... ... you hum Schubert and Lehart you love Viennese waltzes and Grieg and that kind of music jazz concert and modern it's noisy, you said but now you usually like to swing your foot in tact dad... ... you are a bit old-fashioned, but nice the very best friend we have are you little daddy (applause) Shhh! Now you have woken him up! - Take him down here. - Try singing a little for him. I have been walking for the last half hour singing "Sleep, my child, sleep long." You can't offer that to a modern child either. - I can hear myself there. What do I do? - Do not worry. I'll fix it. (hiccup) But man though. Have you got hiccups? BOO! (children's cry) So, did you get scared? Now you must sleep well. Then old uncle Per will sing a song. One with the beat in it. boogie woogie, whistle, whistle, boogie woogie so it's bedtime for a boy in diapers put the rattle awake one, two, three sleep with you and slip into dreamland now close your eyes and look here, like this sleep now, so you will be big and nimble listen, how the clock is ticking, ticking, ticking so it's bedtime for a boy in diapers end of play and fun sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep boogie woogie, whistle, whistle, boogie woogie so it's bedtime for a boy in diapers really sit down one, two, three now sleep sweetly and slip into dreamland snoring with full music can be heard here, like that smile when the sun rises, my friend dream when the sun goes down again so it's bedtime for a boy in diapers put yourself right and sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep (Yawns) Sleep. (Yawns) Is it right what I have done there? Uncle Anders must too. "Three little girls, no one will touch." I think you've been smoking a bit too much lately. - Young people do it these days. - They want what they want. If they don't have a cart, they cut one down, if they don't have money, they steal it. Now look at the guys who have been raving out here lately, gotten naughtier. But they must not come to Grocer Rasmussen. He is on duty night and day. He'll probably get his hands on them. The youth nowadays, they are clever. The dream, but you can't kill everyone with one comb. Nah, but still. It's a good thing the two of us don't have children, Uncle Anders. - What? - Yes, individually, of course. (laughter) It is Mrs. Sejersen who will play out. - Ole! What is it? Do you have to leave? - Yes, as you see. Whoa, is there something wrong? - What could be in the way? - Stop snarling at me. Ole! (squeals) - I thought it was you, Ole. - Where is Leif? - Why? - I have to talk to him. He's in there. The door is open. Leif! - Then you came anyway. - You must be very weak-minded. Drop it there and get going. You're not really smart! Take it easy, you can just slide. What are you coming for? - To warn you. - You could have saved yourself that. - Take then to disappear. - Somebody's coming! Out! Oops! Stop! - Where are you going? - I have not done anything! (engine alarm) Hello! It's here! Good evening. It was lucky you came. It's in here. - Has there been a burglary here? - Yes, some rascals have run away. - But the night watch has one of them. - What has been stolen? Well, that's the usual. Cigarettes and liquor. The two of us must talk together, so you come with me. - I have not done anything. - They all say that. They must not touch anything until the criminal police have been here. (car engine starts) (squeals) What a lovely day. Goodbye, Mrs. Sejersen. - Come well home now, Anders. - Thank you, old friend, for a pleasant day. - What is it? - Chicken for your lunch tomorrow. - Thank you very much. I guess I'm ready then. - Shouldn't you bring your bird with you? - You merciful. Pop. - Now I have to pick it up. - Do you want to call a taxi? - Now I have to drive you home. Don't talk about. Sis, you call. - Here you go, uncle Anders. - Poppe, now the two of us are going home. - Here has also been boring. - Listen, what was that? (laughter) (the phone is ringing) Hello? Yes. Yes. A moment. - Dad. It's the police. - The police? Yes? Yes, it is me. Yes. I'll come right away. It's the police. They took Ole in a burglary. - For burglary? - It was cruel, though. - It must be a mistake. - Yes. It is impossible. - Ole would never agree to that. - No, my girl. - I'd better go there. - I'll go with you, father-in-law. Come on, Mie. Their son insists that he had nothing to do with the break-in. It sounds unlikely when he was caught at the crime scene. - I just wanted to get them out of it. - Extremely worthwhile. But why won't you come out with who the others are? - Who is it, Ole? - I can't say that. Why not, my boy? You always told us: 'Never gossip about others.' Didn't you? Yes. There we have it again, this completely misunderstood playing hero. But it doesn't work. It has become a serious problem with these boy gangs. Have you done something wrong, Ole? - No, father. - It fits. I know my boy. Yes, most parents think so until they are told otherwise. I can take him home then, right? No, we have to keep him until tomorrow. Then he can think about it a bit. When he won't say anything, we have to call in the Children's Services. For the time being, we must regard him as an accomplice. (noise from the school yard) - He has not arrived yet. - He must have been snatched. Wait a minute. I'll ask Per. Hello Per. Why isn't Ole at school today? He had a headache this morning. - Say hello to him if you see him. - Of course, I see him. When you see him, I mean. - I don't like him. - Neither can I. I bet he has something to do with that theft. After all, you can't bet when you don't know anything for sure. We have to find out. - We can shadow him. - Yes. Nice idea. They have taken him. - Do you think he's saying something? - I would strongly advise against that. We have to move our warehouse. I don't want it in our room. - Could we store it in your garage? - Clap in. I have a much better place. - There he is! - So is he. Hey, Ole. Are you on your way up to headmaster? Yes, I have to explain why I'm late. - Were you caught yesterday? - Yes. Did you say anything to the police about us? - Are you afraid? - It will be worse for yourself. - Does that work? - We say you were a part. You can't disprove that, can you? Now you have been warned. You can be quite calm. Nah, it's the girl from the bus. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes, it was you I had to get hold of. I just had to say from my brother that he can't train for the time being. - Isn't that the stupid story? - Yeah. He has completely lost his mood. He just sits at home and hangs out. It's a shame for dad with all the gossip. It would be worse if Ole had done it, wouldn't it? Yes. That is also true. - What is that? - I am drum major in a girls' guard. - Is that the one you go swinging with? - Yes, we are training for a big tat-too. - I don't think I could. - You just do it with your hand. I have more of it in my legs. (squeals) - Did you see him? - Yes. Have you discovered anything? Plenty! They hang over there by the garages. Come. Beware! Away! Come, let's go down to the cellar. Come, you must see. - There is nothing to be mistaken about. - No. - It's woolen, huh? - Yes, very woolly. Think looting other people's businesses. - Those are some tough nails. - But we'll probably have to go after them. - Have you seen that tape recorder? - It's probably also someone they've stolen. And it will be the death of them. I started it before. Nice idea. Then we can hear what they were talking about. We even have one like that at home. Well, here they come. Leif! Someone has been here. That box wasn't there. As long as it's not the red-haired monkey cat that was hot on my heels yesterday. Surely a cod. We must have it all moved today. Did you get the keys to your holiday home? - No one is coming for the time being. - Then we run home after the wagon. - There you have the proof. - Then we hand it over to the police. And so it has happened to them. Somebody's coming. - We'll slip away before they come back. - We must have the tape recorder with us. Let's see if there is a clear path. - Beware! - As long as there is enough petrol in the car. - Remember the tape recorder, Leif. - Fine. (bottles clink) - They put it on the back seat. - I'll grab it. Take the number of the car. Just drop by and see if we've forgotten anything. What now? Go to the police, give them the number and say he has no driver's license. - What about you? - Just wait. I have the idea of ​​all time. (engine chops) - Is there something wrong with it? - It won't start, that shit. Good day. Pardon. Would you mind stopping that car? - What's wrong? - The driver did not have a driver's license. - Which way did he drive? - Hornbaek, but he drove fast. - Now it's not a number, is it? - No. Notify the traffic police. (sirens) - We'll be there soon. Just give it gas. - Okay. Who is behind? - It's the traffic police! - Damn it. (sirens) - You drive a little fast, huh? - Do I do that? Come out just a moment. We have checked your speed. It was 110. May I see the driver's license? I forgot that at home. (knock sound) It was a worse killing spree. - What's this about? - It's a steal. Just ask Leif. Clap in, you little worm! He is full of lies. They were on their way to Hornbaek to hide it in a summer house. They can hear it all on the tape recorder in the back seat. Jensen. We drive to the criminal police. You follow with me. Come on. Yes, yes, little pussy. Come on, come on. Can you drink then? Aah yes, you are so cute. Huh. Does it taste good? Should Black have? Black, come on. We'll probably get into trouble. Magnificent. Huh, in the mouth. Well, here it comes. Oh, so nice. You are a big cat. You too. (low-key baby babble) It tastes delicious. Blacks must also have. Black? There. You too. Aah, that little paw. Does it taste nice? Then Black will have a bit again. Can you stay here? Good day! Is it really you? - Yes, of course. - There sits there nursing kittens. Wasn't there something about them being drowned? That you are not ashamed, Anders. How can you be so hard-hearted? No, it was you who wanted to drown them! What did I want? I would? (laughing) There is absolutely nothing to laugh about. The one who laughs last, laughs best. (laughing) What is so funny? No, father! Have you taken the bottle from Sofus? Yes, he both steals and lies. After all, he was sleeping and looked so stuffed. Now it can no longer be used at all. It's your fault too, Uncle Anders. - Well? - You are the oldest. You could make sure it doesn't happen. But you are both equally nuts. One is crazier than the other. - There you got it. - Yes and you. - Hello there. - Good day, my boy. - It's great to see you smile again. - It was an ugly story. But now Ole is cleared of any suspicion. - That's a worse rascal, him Leif. - There are those who are worse. He told the police I hadn't been there. Yes, you feel sorry for a kid like that. He is from a bad home. - Child of divorce. - Sweet child in a mess. Here you will see my smart uniform. - Are you going to be a soldier, little Mie? - She must be drum major. - Where? - You can see that at our May festival. Take it and try it, Uncle Anders. - Yes, it dresses you. - It is very good. 'Darn good'? But what kind of language is it? (Cossack music) (laughter) (applause) Where is Per? - He is training for a big match. - They have to play against Landskrona. - Your Swedish sister city. - Such a kind of international match? - Has the nonsense spread to Sweden? - Dad, you are hopeless. Now look to get the moss scraped off. On the antenna up there. We're all going there. I don't. It doesn't really matter to me. Ah yes, father. And you must see me too. The girl Guard pulls up with full music. - It will be a great party. - Yes. Yes. We will see. (cheering) - What now? - Now the second half begins. Then the small, talented men come again. Uh, as they could kick. (cheering) (judge's whistle sounds) Sis! Hey, honey. I couldn't come before. How is it going? It says 1-0 to the Swedes. We just started second half. - I can't see Per. - He runs over there. Huss, huss, heysasa! Now the Swede must have da-da! Hi! Hi! Hi! (cheering) Hooray! Hooray! Nice, Claus! Keep fighting! (cheering) (cheering) Hey Sweden, fresh mood, that's what the buzz does! Shut up! Shut up! You can't hear a sound. Shoot! Why doesn't he kick it into the goal? After all, we shouldn't want to score goals in our own goal, but in the Swedish one in the other end. (the judge whistles) - Oh no. What do you think happened? - I'll just go down and look. It looked bad, huh? Keld, come along. Get things ready. (sulks) - Is it bad, Per? - Yes. Ouch, av. - Is it bad? - There is nothing broken. I'll be fine. - It was good. Healthy boy. - Give me the patch. Now make a goal or we'll be upset. - It was nothing special. - Thank God. (cheering) So, so, so! Good, good, good! Sweden, Sweden, Sweden! - Control yourself though. My eardrums. - Cheers, cheers, little aunt. - The lady is not your aunt. - No. - No, as long as they don't win! - We can still make it. (cheering) Well, now I think I can do it again. Just let me come out to fight. Then switch with Claus, and pull all the way up to the center half, - - and lie and lie up there, and then the bank is opened, Per. - I'll have to chop loose. - Then ran with you. He is ready! - Look! There's Per again! - Only if he manages it now. Why wouldn't my son make it? (cheering) - What about time? - There are only a few minutes left. Shoot, Per! Shoot! Come on! (cheering) - Good luck! - Aah, Uncle Anders... So, so, little Mrs. Sejersen. Graat inte, little aunt. It was well played. So, so, little muse. - There is gunpowder in the little worm. - It runs in the whole family. Mie! - I just wanted to say goodbye to you. - Yes. You have to travel today. Yes. My machine goes in an hour. But I must write to you. - Now you won't forget, will you? - No, Mie. So goodbye then. (the girl guard plays "It's summer...") --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
