[announcer] Please give a warm welcome to Lee Scott, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated. [cheers and applause] Well... I know. Thank you. Thank you. I know. Every... All right, all right. Every year... Okay, okay. It would be a pleasure for anybody to be the CEO of this company because, you know, it doesn't matter if you're Sam Walton or you're David Glass or you're Lee Scott. When you come to this meeting, year after year, you get to say, "We had record sales. We had record earnings. We had record reinvestment back into our company." I say all that, but let me tell you, my friends, you better be ready to be better. Because, today, for whatever reason, whether it's our success or our size, Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated has generated fear, if not envy, in some circles. And that makes it more important than ever that we focus on doing the right thing and doing things right every time. There's two things that we should do. Number one is tell the Wal-Mart story. Get the message out there. And the second thing is stay the course. Wal-Mart is too important to individual families who are stretching a budget. We're too important to the suppliers who employ millions of people. We're too important to our associates for who we have so much love and value so much. And your company will continue to demonstrate our citizenship as a good employer and a member of the communities that we serve so well around this world. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll promise you this, we're gonna stay the course. And this company is gonna continue to grow. [Don] Actually, H&H was started... 1962. Started on Main Street in Middlefield. Little country store that, at that time, I was starting a family, and it was pretty difficult to know. It was a big decision. My brother-in-law and I decided we were going to take that step. We went into business. Started in a little one-room building that had a full basement. We did all of the plumbing in the basement. The upstairs retail area was very small. We were there for a year and a half to two years, then we moved on to a larger store in a shopping center and spent several years there. Then proceeded, in 1992, and built this facility here. This gentleman here happens to be my son. He's been a right-hand man for many, many years. It was much easier to retire in '96 when he was here to take over. [Jon] One of the biggest parts, being in the rural areas, what we call our hardware section-- The nuts and the bolts and the nails and all type of fasteners. That's always been good because a lot of the farmers were always mending machinery and things around the farm. Some of the kids that were kids when I was growing up in here, now they've got families, and they come in here for the fix-it-up-type things. Probably since I was eight, come down on Friday nights after school, work till 9:00. Do you have the car? I worked here since I was six. [laughs] Swept or helped customers when I was young, too. At the end of the day, grandpa or dad would give us their pocket change. I spent a lot of late nights in here, too, especially when we were building it. I generally arrive here about 7:15 in the morning, and I unlock the door. I come in and turn the lights on, and I get the day money for each drawer in the registers I open up the registers, and usually at that time, Tom is here. Tom goes ahead and kind of tidies up the front of the store and sets out the American flag and the benches for our customers to sit on. The Amish fellas on their way to work will stop here for things they need for their day's projects. They'll come and get plumbing or electrical supplies or, a lot of times, sporting goods. We have a busy sporting goods division. [Don] Jon has been preparing for it, trying to change stock and inventory. Keeping in mind, basically, to stay with service. If you can't compete in one area, we're going to stay with something that is not offered or that you can compete in. [man] I've probably been shopping here for 32 years or so. All my needs that I need for hardware. [Jon] The mass merchandisers, to a great extent, do not provide excellence in service. I'll use Wal-Mart as an example. You're really lucky if they have anyone in the plumbing section who knows anything about plumbing. We've been trying to get ready for them for the last, probably, 10 years. I had a meeting with all the guys. Explained the purpose of our job and make sure we do everything right. Thorough. Explained what Wal-Mart did and what we do and what we can do different. This was brought to us by an Amish customer of mine. He's so much against the Wal-Mart movement after reading this book that he wanted to get some in and start passing them out or selling them to friends whatever it cost him. So that's basically... I got a few extra ones. He's taking several of them and is getting rid of them, and I'm doing the same. Will I? I have never been in a Wal-Mart store. I never intend to go in a Wal-Mart store. I've never had the need, and I've never liked their principles. That's not nice to say at all, probably, but I've seen a lot of small communities crucified and forced out. Ma-and-pa operations that have been in business for years that are out on the street. They just had to close their doors just because of one entity and it appears that that is their intent, to come into a community and force everybody out. They did nothing but lay down the frickin' red carpet for them. I know how hard it was for my dad, my grandfather to build this building on this lot. They went through everything to try to get the commissioners and stuff to allow them to build here. We had sign issues. Gotta be a certain size. We had to make sure we had enough green around the area. [Jon] I'm all for free enterprise, but when you look at the big picture, the people who own the company are the richest people in the world. So, in reality, I think they could spread that out. I'm curious to see how much they'll actually give back to the community. To even use American with Wal-Mart in the same sentence just... Just I don't agree with at all. It's... It's like a Chinese company to me, only with American board members. It's not a mystery. They come right out on record and said they don't buy American. [Dr. Bruening] All it's done is give China a better distribution center. Whereas before, they would have had to find contacts to sell to and develop their own markets. Now they've got a pipeline right into everybody's living room by going through Wal-Mart. [Glassburner] I think the government should have more control. You talk about monopolies. If Wal-Mart's not a monopoly, I don't know what is. I'm not at all in favor of any kind of communism or socialism. I believe America should always and forever remain free. However, I think there need to be regulations established wherein... You know, they busted up Standard Oil. And they busted up Ma Bell. But Wal-Mart seems to be going on a rampage through the American economy and nobody's even paying attention. I don't... The logic of it escapes me. I spend a lot of time thinking about it. I'm a Republican. I'm a Conservative. And... But I'm following very closely what's happening with the unions. It used to be the union wage was something everybody would look up at and say, "Wow, he's a union worker. He's making $18 or $20 an hour." I realized that's what we're paying our people. We're not union. I'm all for the unions doing whatever they can do, whether it be Wal-Mart or Kmart or any store that's not gonna pay a fair wage. I'm a staunch American. I love America. It's the finest, freest country in the world. I'd still, at my age, fight and die for this country But it seems there are things going on within this country particularly from a business and economic standpoint, that aren't for the good of the people. I mean, the people en masse. A segment of the population is doing well by what's happening, but the greater majority of the people are being made subservient. Sam Walton, I don't think, would be comfortable with the way things are going. I don't think this was why he started the store. It wasn't to crush other competition. [Faenza] We have people in this town, families who can't feed their children. And families who have the entirety of their belongings in a car and in a trailer and are spending most of their life in their car or at the mall because they've been evicted from their homes. Because they can't find work, they can't find work. I think there's a lot of people that don't realize there are those people in town, too. You say that's in Middlefield. -Oh, no. -Exactly. That's not the case. I was dreaming all of a sudden that the people in this town caught on to a great extent, and we were all out in the street, protesting. But I think the likelihood of that happening is... We'll probably see pigs fly before that. [Jon] I put this business plan together with the help of different organizations and people. I went to several different banks to check on some funding and when I got an appraisal on the business and the buildings, the appraiser actually came in and devalued the building. And, here, I figured it would be appreciating after 10 years. And he came in with a lower value. And I questioned him. I said, "How can this be? "With inflation and the economy's not great, but it still should be at least holding its value." And he said, "No. "Anytime a Wal-Mart's coming into a town, they knock the values down "because, sooner or later, there's gonna be a bunch of empty buildings and none of them are gonna be able to sell." Any community on a grand opening is going to see a change, drop in sales. It happens regardless of whether it's Wal-Mart or somebody else. You'll get a drop in sales. So there will be a dramatic change of some type. How long it'll last... It can't last forever because you can't stand the overhead if you don't have the business. So something has to happen. And let's hope it doesn't come to that point, but you never know. [Jon] Well, right now, after we liquidate product, I'm in the process of trying to sell the... We own the building, so I'm trying to sell the building as well as get somebody in here that'll be able to lease, too. I've got a couple people on the line right now that want to talk to me within the next couple days. Hopefully, we'll work something out where we can sell the property and I'll be able to pay all my bills and walk away without any debt. That's if it all works out right. I pray that it will. [Nicholson] I remember that like it was yesterday. The hell with it. Wal-Mart will buy the damn town. We'll shut them down. We used to drive through towns going, "Six months. Three months. Six months," of when we'd be closing them. [man] You drive all the way up to New York City on Route 80. You can pull off at Clarion or any of those towns up there and you'll see a Wal-Mart up on the hill. You'll see a Perkins and maybe a Burger King. Then you'll drive farther into the town, and you'll see an empty town. It looks like a neutron bomb hit it. [Springsteen] * Well, I rode that ribbon of highway * * I saw above me the endless skyway * [Norman] They don't get it. When we start talking about quality of life, they start talking about cheap underwear. I keep saying, you can't buy small-town quality of life at a Wal-Mart. They don't sell it. But once they steal it from you, you can't get it back at any price. * I followed my footsteps * * Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts * * And all around me... * [Thibodeaux] We thought it was the most fantastic thing in the world that Wal-Mart was coming to Hearne, Texas. I mean, it was like they had bestowed some great honor on the community. And we welcomed them, literally, with open arms. We could not say enough good about them. Could not do enough for them to help them come. When Wal-Mart first made the decision to come here, you could come to town on a Saturday evening and not find a parking place anywhere. I came to downtown Hearne on Saturday before Christmas and there was 12 cars in downtown Hearne. I counted them. 12 cars in downtown Hearne. That is pathetic. * This land is your land * * This land is my land * * From California * * To the New York Island * * From the Redwood Forest * * To the Gulf Stream Waters * * Oh, this land was made for you and me * Wal-Mart was a great thing for our community. It's really awakened the west side of our town. I think Sam Walton would tell us, just as he did before he passed away, that the number-one thing in this company is our associates. We've got stores that aren't treating associates as well as they should be treated. It's a community college. I didn't have much for anything else. I was doing really well, you know? I had a 4.0 average. But life happens. My dad got sick. My mom got sick. And things happen, and it just didn't work out the way I thought it was going to. When I started working there, I had so much pride in my job. I did. I didn't mind being there when they needed me. I didn't mind doing... I knew that we were short-staffed. At that time, I didn't know it was a purposeful thing. That's their intention. They had stacks like this of applications in the back. -They just didn't hire them. -Right. We're told, "We don't know what to do. We don't have the people. We don't have this. We don't have that." And I really did, at first, I was really... I felt bad for them. It was like, "Oh, okay. I'll give you an extra hour here. I'll come in early tomorrow. I won't take my day off." [Devoy] Always having to stay late. Supposed to work till 11:00. You're there till 12:00, 12:30. Keep the number of associates from being full-time as many as you can. Keep them part-time as much as you can. And just keep reducing that expense. The company doesn't allow the stores enough payroll dollars on their budget to get the job done. And the job is enormous. This company is raking in the dough, in the sales. My store alone did over $100 million in sales the year that I left. [Devoy] Having to get up with the kids. Just getting them out to school after four hours' sleep. They don't care about what you sacrifice. It doesn't matter how many people lose their families. It doesn't matter if the associates have good healthcare. It doesn't matter, anything, other than what the bottom-line profit is for that store that month. It makes it really difficult to have a good family life at Wal-Mart. If you can squeeze every dime out of them, you go for it. It doesn't matter what happens to their families. If they fall apart, they get sick, the hell with them. We're troubled by the fact that there are people who work full-time who, in fact, cannot provide enough for their families to live decently. It was just impossible for me to pay my bills and pay for day care and work. You should have plenty of time to go into the office. The money I did get went right back into Wal-Mart. I'd get my check. Have it deposited. Go shopping. I had-- When I first started Wal-Mart, I had my kids on the Wal-Mart insurance. It got to the point where it just was too much for me to handle. I just couldn't afford it. I'd have to pay my premiums at work. And when I took them to the doctor's, I still had to pay. I always had to pay a chunk of money. I'm proud of the fact that we have the benefits that we have and that we have the wages we have. People making $7 an hour that has to go to a doctor, they're not going to be able to meet their deductible. [woman] I have an 18-month-old baby, and he didn't have any kind of insurance. When he was sick, I would have to try and fix him myself. Get him medication myself. If he had to go to the doctor, I would have to take him and pay it as I could. Sam Walton believed that it was inappropriate for an associate with illness in the family to have to worry about how were they going to survive the financial impact. [Noble] I was under my mom's insurance plan with a local grocery store that she worked for. Any prescription it was, it was $5. And now, through Wal-Mart, for that one bottle of pills, I'm paying $70. I can't afford to put my children on the Wal-Mart insurance because it's too expensive. There's no way I can afford to have $75 taken out of each check just for medical. That's why, because I'm such low-income, I am able to get the Medicaid for the kids through Colorado State. But they're a billion-dollar corporation, so I don't see why they cannot offer a better medical package for their associates so that we can afford to get our families on insurance. You start weighing, "Okay, he's sick. We eat. Which one do we do?" "Well, let's give him an Aspirin." No matter what anybody says, they're at poverty level. I watched so many people go without lunch in the lounges that I stopped eating in the lounges. I had my managers eat in there because I couldn't stand it. They just wouldn't eat, and we weren't allowed to offer them any money. And there were people I'd see that didn't eat nothing. They'd take an hour lunch and just sit there. We had full-time employees that worked at Wal-Mart. And they had medical. But the medical was so high, so they had to go out and get medical, some type of government medical. While I was working at Wal-Mart, I was on WIC. It's an excellent program. It saved my life, really, because you got all the formula and cereal and stuff you needed for the baby. And I also went to the Medicaid office. It can be a real hassle having to deal with the offices, but at least they're there. I'm thankful for the programs that are available. It's not a fun situation. It's demeaning. I always heard people say, "There are so many people who just use the system." I can't imagine that, because there is no way I would want to spend any length of time having to do what you have to do to get assistance. You talk about using the system. Look at the way Wal-Mart is using the system. They're promoting people to go to healthy kids and to get food stamps and Section 8 housing. They're the ones that are using the system. Yeah, it's pretty bad when you need to tell your employees that, "All these programs are available for you because we're not paying you enough money." Retail giant Wal-Mart is encouraging its workers to go on welfare. Instead of paying for employees to have health benefits, she says Wal-Mart is making the government take care of it. In Florida, Wal-Mart has more employees and family members eligible for Medicaid than any other company. Critics accuse the retail giant of using Medicaid and state programs for the poor as its health-care plan. [man] This report from U.C. Berkeley researchers concludes Wal-Mart costs state taxpayers $86 million a year and county taxpayers as much as another $25 million to pick up the tab for public healthcare, income-tax credits, housing subsidies, and food stamps. [woman] Evelyn Dees used to work full-time for Wal-Mart but didn't have company health-care benefits. She literally couldn't afford to pay for it, so she turned to government assistance. [woman 2] What the public doesn't understand is that those "everyday low prices" are based on taxpayer subsidies. Wal-Mart is getting away with it because they can. I talked to the regional personnel manager about who was going to take care of the Wal-Mart associates and their health-care needs. He said, "Let the state do it." The personnel manager told me personally that there's assistance out there for people. They should be able to go use it. Use your taxpayers' dollars. I had a list of all of the government agencies and the different places people could go if they needed money for their utility bills, if they needed to apply for food stamps, or if they needed to apply for WIC or for Medicaid. So your dignity is not there. Your pride is not there. You go to work knowing that you're not making enough money to really make ends meet, but yet you gotta go with a smile on your face and fake it. Yeah, that's pretty bad. Come up with some type of healthcare that a full-time person can afford. and don't have to put on the scale, "healthcare" or "feed my family." "Why is it that a corporation that, in 2003, "had an outstanding $240 billion in sales would not provide a livable wage and affordable healthcare for their employees?" There's nowhere around that there's a company that makes this much money and still turns around and makes their associates go to the state for aid. [woman] I think my company takes family very seriously. They'll help you achieve anything you want. The possibilities are absolutely endless at Wal-Mart. Think of the careers that get started in this company and the difference it makes in people's lives. But most importantly to me, jobs that come with opportunity for personal development. [Noble] When I first started working at Wal-Mart, I was still in high school. I didn't have any plans to go to college later on. The people that I was working with were just so nice. I just thought that was awesome. My job function as a tire and lube express technician is performing an oil service, doing tire changes, battery service, stocking the inside shelves, writing up work orders and greeting the customer, running the cash register, ringing people out for groceries they bought throughout the store, and they want it all done at the same time. All I'm worried about is the one 4% raise a year that you get from Wal-Mart. I've worked there three years, and I have gotten, I think, $1.07 raise. I don't have good health benefits. I can't afford to live on my own anymore. Most of it is the poor treatment from management at Wal-Mart. I don't know. It's just weird. I've always been kind of quiet and shy. And now I kind of need to stand up for myself and my community So I just searched the Internet for a while. Whatever I typed in brought up the same thing. I'd type in "employee rights." It would bring up the union. "Fair labor practice" would bring up the union. These corporate people in the Wal-Mart corporation don't even really like to say the word "union." To them, it's a curse word. "Third-party representation" is the way they put it. [Lehman] Wal-Mart is very opposed to unions. One of the most anti-, if not the most aggressively anti-union company in the history of the United States. Just relentless in their search for union activity and try to squelch it, kill it. -We got a few. -Ed Dupontes. Ed Dupontes. He gave you a call, right? He gave me a call, and he says he didn't want nothing to do with the union. His answer was, "No, no, no." I had a worker that came to me with a piece of paper that someone had typed up on a computer. In big, bold, black letters, it said, "We need a union." No signatures. That's all it said. That in itself is enough to require me, as a store manager to go and make a phone call. And the phone call comes to Bentonville. And that afternoon, I had to personally drive to the airport and pick up three guys that flew in in a corporate jet and pick them up and bring them back to my store. We have to do this for the reasons we started it. [Fortune] What they do is they basically walk in and tell the store manager, "You're no longer in charge of this store. Every decision goes through us." [Nicholson] They taught me how to profile people. Of course, I didn't know that was the term then. And it was identifying people that were the strongest representers of the petition to organize, or at least get a vote. Anita we need to contact still. Possibility there. You walk up to a couple of associates, and they're talking. They walk away from each other. They gotta go. They're conspiring to do something. [horn honks] [man] Be noisy. Be happy. Be boisterous. We're here to support folks who are trying desperately to fight against the world's largest, richest, and probably meanest corporation. [Fortune] The associates in the automotive department were flooded with brainwashing material against the union. I got fooled by a union. Fooled bad. All the union is working at is taking a cut out of my pay. Yeah, take your money and spend it to help political campaigns and help people I don't even vote for. Because they know a union would just mess it up. But don't take my word for it. Just ask the associates working here in the building Now I can't get within the store of 50 feet before somebody approaches me, or there's somebody following me around the store. [man] I was never alone. I was followed wherever I went. Truly, the managers would follow me. [Lehman] During the process of intimidating them, they make their lives miserable. They do illegal surveillance. They put cameras up in work stations, work areas, break rooms. You got a target on your back. Everybody else know, "I gotta stay away from this person because I can get fired for talking to this person." They're targeting a lot of it at Josh. They were talking about Josh being held up on their shoulders and paraded around. They're like, "Yeah, he's just using it for a way to get, you know, attention." [Fortune] One of their favorite tactics is to come out and say, "We have to freeze all the raises in the store because we can't appear to be bribing anybody." [Kuc] It was a great political ploy by Wal-Mart, in my mind, to say that's why they weren't getting raises. Because some of those employees started putting pressure on the TLE people, the Tire and Lube Express people, because, "Hey, we can't get raises because of you." I was so scared to go to the break room because they made us all go to break together because it was really dead after that. We start walking through, and, like, customers and other associates were giving us dirty looks, I was like, "I'm not sitting in that break room. They're gonna jump me or something." Alicia's good. Alicia's way good. Yeah. Talked with her quite a bit. And Cody, we know Cody's good. -Right. -Cody's with us here. It struck the managers to start hiring associates in the store. And what they do this for is to try to dissolve the percentages of the people in the store that are for the union. -James. -James is another new hire. I'm not even sure who that is. Yeah. But this is our store. This isn't their store. We're the ones... We're making them money. We're the little worker ants, you know. So, what's your prediction? Right now, it's at 50-50. I mean, the few people in the middle are just gonna make it or break it right now. I think you lost Alicia. No. I've talked with her quite a bit. She's just kind of a hard-to-read-type person. I hang out with her on the weekends. She's definitely into it. She's real strong. I just believe it's really just gonna go like, pfft, done 'cause Cody's not voting. Ryan's not voting yes. And I'm still kind of... I kind of really don't want to vote, but I kind of have to because... You're getting all freaked out because of what they're saying. They're not gonna know how you voted. All it's gonna be is a bunch of numbers right now. So we've got six for a no. Another six yes. So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven on the fence. [Lehman] The company does everything that it can, and that means anything. They will kill it. They'll kill the campaign. Wal-Mart winning out, as you said, 17-1, but the union... [Fortune] It's not a fair battle. It's not according to the National Labor Relations Act. But when they find that there's a campaign going on, everything that can be done, fair, unfair, legal, maybe not-so-legal, is done to keep the union out. [man speaking German] [interpreter] Wal-Mart was very lucky to acquire two really good companies. But, of course, they were already unionized. Wal-Mart had no choice. [interpreter 2] Because of the union, we get 36 days of vacation a year. Usually, people take three weeks in the summer, three weeks in the spring. It depends. You can split your vacations into two or three times per year. Or even more often, if you prefer. [interpreter 3] My job is very important. And if I have to fear for my job, it's a bad thing. A very bad thing. If Wal-Mart says we're all a big family and we have nothing to hide, everything's great, then I don't understand why the colleagues in America can't have a workers council, can't establish a union. I can't understand that. [man] Wal-Mart is a career. It's not just a job. Good quality of life. Good educational opportunities for my children. It is right for the 1.2 million Wal-Mart associates, including more minorities and more seniors that work in any other company in America. Wal-Mart offers the right job at the right time in their lives, and it gives them a step up that economic ladder. My name is Edith Arana. I live here in Southern California. I have two girls. I go to school to be a preschool teacher. I worked for Wal-Mart for six years. They explained to me the different things they offered and the type of company Wal-Mart was. I said, "That's a company I want to work for." I always found it rewarding to me to help the customer find what they were looking for. I could work wonders. [laughs] "Do more with less. "I know the true meaning of do more with less. "They want the associates to do more and they're gonna pay them less." They would come in the office or on the floor. It didn't matter where you were working. They would say, "Well, you know we have no overtime. There is to be no overtime whatsoever." We may have five baskets of merchandise that need to be put back. You may have 30 minutes left on your eight-hour shift. "But we need those baskets put away." And they usually do it with a smile. You would go along with it because you needed that job. And there was no ifs, ands, or buts about it. They would let you know, one way or the other, "If you can't do it, I'll just get somebody else to do it. "You are not a person that cannot be replaced. "And we're hiring all the time." And in your mind, you go, "Look, I got these kids at home. I'll just have to make that sacrifice." And you will. They are asked to work off the clock with the implication that if they don't work off the clock, that is what is expected at this particular store, they are gonna lose their job. And they do it as a matter of survival. And it comes from the top. [woman] Wal-Mart is fighting legal battles with scores of former employees in 31 states. Hourly workers who say the company has cheated them out of hundreds of millions of dollars in overtime pay. The Wal-Mart corporation paid approximately $50 million to settle an off-the-clock class-action suit in Colorado. In Texas, it is estimated that they cheated workers out of up to $150 million in unpaid wages. Our policy is that we pay everyone for every hour worked. [laughter] You're the CEO of Wal-Mart. That's the best you can do? "If you work here, we'll pay you." That's it? "Work at Wal-Mart. It's better than getting kicked in the nuts." [laughter] Our district manager actually explained to us how to cheat workers out of overtime. He said, "This is how you can come in on your payroll budget for this week." If you had, say, three workers that had overtime, maybe an hour or even 20 minutes over 40 hours, he explained to us how to go in the system under a false user ID to get into the computer and move that time to the next week. I've seen managers go in when someone worked 41, 42 hours and change it to 40 hours. The people that are struggling to just live on the basics every day or do without need that extra minute or two on their paycheck. And those are the ones that are victimized the most. I'm not the only one that did it. I've seen every manager, except for one general manager, do it. [man] Wal-Mart refuses to follow the very American ethic that has served the country well for many years. People should be paid for the work they do. [man 2] Wal-Mart currently faces lawsuits in 31 different states for wage and hour abuses, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of workers. As a store manager, you're responsible for reducing your expenses every single month. And the only way to do that is to keep the associates' numbers down. [woman] I was just getting about 19 hours a week. That's just... You can't pay bills with that. It's just not right at all. If you're not getting those full-time hours for that week, that's devastating. It may help them on their bottom line, but it doesn't help you at home. When it comes to jobs, we have good jobs. 74% of our people are full-time. Most people in America don't know that. Although most people don't know Wal-Mart considers full-time employment 28 hours a week, which, at their starting wage, works out to under $12,000 a year. [man] I.N.S. agents arrested 250 undocumented workers in 61 Wal-Marts across America. Wal-Mart is paying $11 million to settle federal allegations it used illegal immigrants to clean its stores. I'm stunned that they would employ illegal immigrants. Very stunned. [laughter] You're stunned they hire illegal immigrants for nearly no pay? Lady, you just bought a sweatshirt there for 29 cents. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, could be facing the largest lawsuit ever brought against a private employer. Lawyers suing Wal-Mart will file their motion today. If a judge agrees, the company could be facing a class-action lawsuit for discrimination against 1.6 million current and former female employees. I had no idea about the lawsuit. There were people in my store that had no idea about it also. Members of management in the upper echelons of Wal-Mart management talk about how women at Wal-Mart are useless. I have done receiving manager. I was operation manager. I was merchandise manager. So, it's like I kind of did it all. I cleaned the bathroom every single day. Ken would come to me and say, "It's your turn again." "I'd say to him, it was my turn yesterday." And he'd laugh, and we'd joke about it. We'd go back and forth. I'd say, "I know. I'm the only female that's working out here. So, hence, I have to clean the bathroom." Nobody said, "Well, why a woman been in this company all of these years?" You look at the evaluation. Every general manager stated, "She should be a G.M. within a year. Within six months." Every evaluation. What's wrong with this picture? The company hides the fact that these practices are very systemic. They're systemic, meaning they come out of the home office. Bottom line, if you were a female, you weren't worth it. You just weren't worth the time. You weren't worth the money. You weren't worth the effort, nothing. A blind man. My grandmother was blind. She could see better than what you guys are seeing. Because you put the blinders on. You didn't want to see. When I called, I called to file a petition, or to file a claim against them, just to say that they discriminated against me because I was a woman. I'm Betty. I'm a Wal-Mart associate. I love working at Wal-Mart. I love that they pay me less than men because that means I can't afford to eat as much and I get to keep my figure. Jim got promoted to management over me, but that's okay, because he's a cutie. You go get them, honey. When I applied for the assistant manager training program, I didn't get any response back at all. I went through everything I had done for my store manager. And I had done it, like, you would do a check list. Said, "You told me to do this. I did it. You told me to do this. I did it." He agreed with a nod. And I said, "So now I want what you promised me." He just bluntly told me, "There's no place for people like you in management." And I said, "Well, what do you mean, people like me?" And I said to him, I said, "That I'm a woman or that I'm black?" He said, "well, two out of two ain't bad." I was called "milkboy," "nigger," at this particular store. There was an incident where this one guy's bicycle, they hung it up in the ceiling, and put a rope around it. You know, literally put the-- Lynched this guy's bicycle. I complained because, to me, it was offensive. And it was unacceptable. What happened after that? Nothing. I don't know if I was more devastated than humiliated, but in my mind, the way I love people, I just couldn't see another person, maybe they are not strong as I am, to be able to take that. This woman walked through the hallway and said, "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the toe." I reported this incident. Nothing happened. If you complain about discrimination, they'll just let more people out on you to see if they can really work you out of there or whatever. And that's basically what happened to me. I just got tired. I started going backwards in my mind of all the different stuff, and it started clicking and clicking, and the more I thought, the worse I felt. Because I felt to myself, "You're an idiot. How could you have not known?" I was devastated. The time that I spent on those roads, I could've been at home with my husband. But I wasn't. Because I was doing my end of what Wal-Mart promised me. "If you do this, we will do this." And it was not worth my husband's life. And the worst part about it is is that nobody will ever know how big this is, what happens to people. There's got to be more people like me out there, but they're too afraid to say anything. [woman] I love my job. It's challenging, but it's really satisfying. We truly are living the American dream. It's out there, and it's at Wal-Mart. Great citizenship also means that we're gonna support the communities that we're in through our charities and the organizations that exist there. [Red] You know, the time I was born, counting Hoover, I have lived under about 36% of the presidents of the United States. Think about that. Hoover and Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Senior Bush, and Junior Bush. So there's 13 presidents out of 43 I've lived under. We came here in 1959 and started the IGA store, which is independent grocers. We had approximately 150 employees. And of these 150 employees, the full-time employees, and that was a great number of them, had full coverage on insurance, health insurance. We also had 401(k) pension plan that they really appreciated. In small family-owned businesses, you do become attached to your employees, and they're very important to you. We always tried to have a Christmas party or Christmas dinner where all the employees came, and we'd close the stores. [Jordan] And every day after school, I'd get off the bus and run up to the store, 'cause we lived a couple of blocks up from it. [Red] The bailer that we use here is a bailer that was left over from when we closed down the stores... in the late '90s. [Scott] I don't believe it's fair the way that Wal-Mart can come in with the funding that they get to put their sewers, infrastructure, road, parking signals, ingress, egress, etc., compared to what the independent retailer gets. No, I don't believe it's fair. Certainly, it's not fair, and I think he, at one time, did go talk to them in Cameron and say, "If we're gonna run a business here, can you help us?" Well, no, they couldn't do that. [Red] I don't think it's fair to help them to build roads for their business, and at the same time the store opens, puts others out of business. The competition that we're up against really hasn't caused a problem as much as the competition being helped by our government. From one level to the other, they get all the breaks. Wal-Mart is coming in and running us out. We know you helped them, or you gave them tax abatements. Will you give us a tax abatement? No, they couldn't do that. So, you know, the county nor the city would do that. And, of course, everybody knew it was unfair, but what can you do about it? Maybe... Well, there is nothing you can do about it. Sewer, water, any of that stuff, as far as I know, we never received one dime from the city, county, or any place like that. If you tell them that you don't want them in your city limits, there has been nothing to stop them from buying five acres out here, outside the city limits, popping their building down, hooking up to rural water and having all the negative effects on the city and none of the positive effects. [Red] They have a supercenter in Cameron. It took about 40% of our business in Cameron and about a third of our business here in Hamilton. In Brookfield, it took over 50% of our business overnight. [Dee] It's hard to make those payments with our wholesaler having problems. So everything just kind of culminated in everybody having problems. To pay the employees, we used cash from the inventory. And then you didn't have any inventory. [Ernest] In the process of all this, I had to borrow money to put in the stores with the farm as collateral. It went down from there, so we had no recourse but to just close them up. It was 40 years of hard work and seeing it disappear all at once, it wasn't a very easy thing to adjust to, but... And now you can see, Herb is still saddened a lot. It certainly wasn't what he planned. But we had a lot of good times. He did a lot things. He knows lots of people. And they respect him. And so I don't know what else you're gonna get out... I closed that store, and that was a Sunday morning. I'd went down to open and... Just... Yeah, I remember him coming down the stairs and sat down on the couch, and Mom told me. And I started crying. It was like a family member. We were there every day. It was a big part of our life. It was probably my favorite place. I liked being there. They wanted it from me. And I love them to death for it. But, you know, they wanted it from me and my family. And if Wal-Mart still gains ground and have a monopoly, where will our families and where will our children be? And what will they have to do to work and to be competitive, and in ten years, it's probably going to get to be very, very serious for the nation. It might happen that way now. I hope it don't for our children's sake, but it could be... It could be real serious, be a revolution. I won't say it would be a civil war, but it would be a revolution. I don't think anybody wants that. I'm Kim Rossetta, and I'm a fourth and fifth grade bilingual teacher in Denver, Colorado, in the Denver Public Schools at Newlon Elementary School. Wal-Mart received subsidies of about $1.7 million, and with that $1.7 million, our Denver metropolitan area, that could have kept the three schools that we just closed down this spring open. I am Monica Jefferson. I am a speech-language pathologist. And I work for Special School District of St. Louis County. Wal-Mart receives over $31 million in subsidy from the Missouri government. Cathedral City made a $1.8 million investment, but because of Wal-Mart's lies and not stepping up to the plate with their commitments, we're short on policemen, we're short on firemen. We've eliminated the Recreation Division of this city. We're not able to provide the services to our residents that they need and deserve. We're going to have lives hanging in the balance because we're not going to be able to provide these services. My name is Charles Hussey. I have been a 4th grade teacher in Washington State for many years. When I think of the million dollars that Wal-Mart received for its distribution center and what we could have done there for students, it's outrageous. Taking revenue away from our community that will have a direct impact on our ability to continue to provide some level of service. In Illinois, Wal-Mart has received $100 million in subsidies, and that has affected our school systems. That money could go into our school systems to rehire all of those support teachers that we need back, the support personnel. We could have our school psychologists back, our social workers back, our counselors back. We could pick up... These programs are being cut because Wal-Mart has received subsidies. Now, what we're facing currently is that Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, which are the same people, have, in fact, for business purposes, decided that they are going to leave our community. And not moving 20 miles away, they were moving two miles away. [Sowles] One is being built right on the property line of our city, which we still will not receive any benefit from. [Pettis] Just outside the city limits, so just as we were about to begin to receive a 100% of the sales-tax revenue from that deal, we found out that we had been the chumps to end up with a vacant building of the size that most businesses can't fill. so you have a huge building that sits vacant for months and years. [woman] That's why at Wal-Mart we give back five dollars every second to the communities we serve throughout the holidays and all year long... To make the season and every day a little brighter. Responsible citizenship also means looking out for the environment. We can make a difference in this area's sustainability. [Lisenby] One of the most exciting things about a riverkeeper organization is working with the public, and we have a lot of volunteers that volunteer to keep their part of the Catawba River. Because the Catawba River is dammed 11 times and it has 11 lakes on it, we have lakes with coves, and so we call our volunteers cove-keepers. And these cove-keepers work to safeguard and protect the Catawba River. Essentially, we did an investigation, and we visited about seven Wal-Marts in the Catawba River valley to see what their environmental practices were and judge whether their current environmental practices would have an impact on the drinking water in the town of Belmont. What we found in every single case is that Wal-Mart had a practice of storing herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers in the parking lots. What concerned us most about this particular case was the proximity of this Wal-Mart and the creek running right by the Wal-Mart site, and that creek empties right here at the intake site. For me, when I'm out on patrol and on the river and there's a drinking-water intake right there, what I know is that there is a mom somewhere who's at a kitchen sink and she's putting water in a bottle to make formula for her baby, and that baby is drinking... The labels on some of the herbicides and pesticides said, "This product known to cause reproductive harm by the state of California and birth defects." These pallets with bags and bags of this material, many of them broken and busted and spilling on the pavement, every time it rained, all this material was washing right into the storm water, and eventually making its way here, to the Catawba River, the source of drinking water for almost two million people in the region. So we began calling Wal-Mart to really express our concern about these chemicals making its way into the public drinking water, and they gave me a name and a phone number of somebody in Arkansas, headquarters, to call. That person, when I talked to him, wasn't the right person. They said they didn't think they had an environmental person that was in charge of handling environmental affairs, but they would try and find out. They never called. So, again, I called back. This time I called their attorneys. I called the contact name they gave me and said, "Look, I'm not getting any answer from anyone at corporate Wal-Mart, "and because I haven't, I'm going to start a weblog, "and every contact I have with you, "I'm going to put on my website "and report what your response is. And if there's no response, that's what's going to be on our website." So that's what I did. Two or three days later, they still didn't call back. We then sent them the law. And I elevated the rhetoric and said, "It appears to us as if you are violating the storage laws. We are getting ready to contact our attorneys." Still, no one called. Finally the attorneys for Wal-Mart who had testified in the hearing gave me the name of a person that they thought was their contact. I finally reached that person at Wal-Mart headquarters in Arkansas, and he said he had just started the job. He had been in training for the last two weeks, and he didn't know what to tell me. So at this time, I started calling the news media and asking them to do a story. We got a great local news station here in Charlotte, North Carolina, that responded on camera, showing these pallets and pallets and pallets of chemicals, herbicides, fertilizers stored in the parking lots right beside the storm-water drain. It ran in the morning, the noon time, the 6:00, and the evening news on that day. It just so happens that the Wal-Mart manager for the local store where most of the video was shot, that had 81 pallets of the material out in the parking lot, saw the story. Called his regional manager first thing the next day and said, "You won't believe what I saw on the news last night." And for all his stores in the region, he had them pull those chemicals from the parking lots and put them under cover. As I read the case history on all the environmental finds, and particularly the consent decrees from the Attorney General's office ordering Wal-Mart to establish better environmental protection, what flabbergasted me most about the lack of corporate response is their apparent disregard for these consent decrees and that they hadn't taken them very seriously. It's only the local guys. I can say in my history as riverkeeper, I don't think I've ever encountered a corporation, be it a power company, an oil company, as unresponsive as Wal-Mart. Wildlife conservation is very important to me, but it's really exciting when a company like Wal-Mart makes it a priority, too. We have a great relationship with the Chinese government. They have treated us very fairly in what they have done. They actually, much like in the U.S., they hold us to a higher standard. Higher standard of sanitation, higher standard of employment. [interpreter] My name is Wang Qi. I'm 21 years old. I'm from the Shanghai province. My family plants corn, paddies, and potato. I wanted to earn some money so that their life could be easier. At least, I didn't want their life to be too hard. They would work from dawn till night. They would begin to work on the farm at daybreak and wouldn't get back until night. I thought about working in the factory when I was in middle school. At the time, I thought that it would be interesting and exciting to work in the factory. I left my hometown on April 29th this year and then began to look for a job in Shenzhen. At that time, I had a friend working in that factory who also came from my hometown. So I went to see my friend each day at the factory gate, which is just in front of Wien Yie's room. [interpreter 2] My name is Wien Yie, and I come from Hunan province. [interpreter 1] He heard my dialect when I was talking with my friend. Then he spoke with me using the same dialect. He asked me where I was from. I didn't tell him the truth. I said I was from the Chungking area. He served for the army in Chungking for a couple of years, so he can speak the Chungking dialect. That's the way we got to know each other. [interpreter 2] My girlfriend and I work in the same Wal-Mart factory. She works in the old workshop, and I work in the new one. I am on the night shift and finish work at 7:00 in the morning. She begins to work at 7:30 each morning and works overtime until 10:00 p.m. We don't have much time to spend together, but whenever there is an opportunity, I'll cook some delicious food for her. [interpreter 1] We like singing karaoke, shopping around, and buying some little things. And that way, you feel more relaxed. Most of the times we go to karaoke, sing songs, and listen to music, and we get in a good mood. [music playing] We tend to rent a room outside and cook by ourselves, because the meals offered by the factory are really disgusting. However, the dilemma is whether you live in the dorm that the factory allocated or not, they always deduct the rent from our wages. You have no choice but to live inside. If you're going to move out of the dorm, the factory will tell you, "You can move out "and we will not charge you electricity or water. But rent will still be charged." You see, if we live inside the dorm, we pay not only the rent but also the utilities, which is charged by how much you use. There are very few fans installed in my workshop. It's extremely hot inside. If they plan to install a new fan, then the others will tell us that we can only have one fan or the fans that are there. In my working position, there is no wind at all. Can you imagine, I'm sitting there and dripping with sweat all day long. My body never gets dry. [interpreter 2] Wal-Mart informed the factory that it was going to send people here for the inspection and they will tell us how to lie for the inspector. For example, the workers must respond as though they work six days when asked how many days they work, even though they actually work for seven days. [interpreter 1] Then we workers don't dare to say anything wrong because we're really afraid of being punished by managers. Wal-Mart informs us in advance and has a meeting to teach us how to lie. If you lie well, you'll be rewarded. If not, you'll be punished or fired. The worker is given a fake pay slip. And they never let you have the chance to speak the truth, but threaten you to deliver false information. We really work day and night in order to get the wage of less than three dollars a day. My mom wants me back home because she feels it's too toilsome. But I don't think so. Everybody else here has the same situation as me. If they can do this, I can do it also. I always think about my mom when I'm very tired. That would be wonderful if she could be here with me. She takes care of me very well when I'm sick. She'll let me have a good rest and cooks anything that I'd like to eat. She's really very nice to me. [interpreter] I would respectfully like to ask the boss of Wal-Mart to give the Chinese workers some consideration and a chance for a little time off. [interpreter 2] Customers of Wal-Mart, when you wear expensive clothes, when your children play with high-quality toys, think about China and the Far East. [interpreter 3] Those profits you made and the wonderful life you have are the sweat and tears and overtime working of Chinese people. If one day I encounter a lady who just bought a toy from Wal-Mart, I'll say, "Respectable customer, respectable Wal-Mart customer, "do you know why you can buy such a cheap toy from Wal-Mart? That's because we workers work all day, every day and night." We added 125,000 new jobs around this world this past year-- Good jobs. [cheers and applause] Jobs and benefits. We have profit sharing. Retirement savings accounts for our associates. But most importantly to me, jobs that come with opportunity for personal development. [man] 189,000 young women in Bangladesh are sewing garments for Wal-Mart. These workers are getting up at 5:30 in the morning, they brush their teeth with their finger, using ashes from the fire, because they can't afford a toothbrush. Forced to work from 8:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night, 14 hours a day, seven days a week on these wages of 13 to 17 cents an hour. These are women who are hit by their supervisors, trapped in utter misery. As the largest company in the world, Wal-Mart sets the standards that other companies are going to follow. So, Wal-Mart right now is sucking down standards all across the world. These are workers who have no rights. The outlook for this company today is very positive. In every country that we operate in, the Wal-Mart model works. Because once your associates know that you will stand up for what is right, then when they see a wrong occur, they're more likely to contact you. And we have a very aggressive program under way to make sure, and have had now for the last couple of years. [Lynn] I was a global services manager for Mexico, Central and South America. My job function entitled three things. Oversight of all factory certifications, which means you go in there and you make sure that there are humane working conditions. Big deal with the factory certifications is to make sure that the workers are in a clean, safe, humane environment. When I was in a factory, you know, you talk to the people, and the people are so nice. And they were so good, and they were just working for so little money and without any condition of fairness whatsoever with their compensation and their working conditions. I went back to my hotel room and just wept the first time. You know, after dinner, I had picked up the phone. I was calling my wife and just telling her what I'd seen, and I started crying about that. Telling her... She was like, "It's going to be all right." And I was like, "I know. We're doing the right thing." I just couldn't imagine it was this way. I thought that a company like Wal-Mart, once we started reporting the truth of what was happening at the factory, that it would take quick action to try and make the working conditions better. I believed in the mission and the culture which I thought existed at Wal-Mart. I led more Wal-Mart cheers than just about anybody that I know. I didn't even mind being the squiggly. I mean, if you would have cut me, I would have bled Wal-Mart-blue blood. I didn't know that we weren't gonna make it the goal to correct the violations. I didn't think that any retaliation would be brought against me for doing my job. I now realize I was pretty naive. But it just didn't occur to me that Wal-Mart would do anything, except for the right thing, once they were faced with the truth. I kept going into other factories and seeing the same things over and over again. And it became apparent to me that this was not an isolated issue. All you got to do is follow the money, and the ones who are in power right now have tremendous pressure on them to perform like never before. The system was designed to keep the goods flowing to the United States. When push came to shove, they did not stand up and do the right thing. What really happened was we were getting fired for telling the truth about the factory certifications. And that was shocking. It was embarrassing. It ripped my heart out. To have all of that ripped from you and then to get sold out and lied to... Wal-Mart let me down, and when I needed somebody to look out for me, even though I was trying to look out for Wal-Mart for years. We want to make sure that our suppliers comply with local country codes, with human rights standards. That people are not underage, that they're paid well. "Made in the U.S.A." It means something. "Made in the U.S.A." means a job for somebody. [announcer] But we've made it our policy to find more U.S. suppliers who can compete because American goods mean American jobs. At Wal-Mart, we pledge to support America's sources whenever we can so you can, too. If we keep our prices low and raise our average wage substantially, we would, in fact, decrease our profitability disproportionately. And we would sacrifice a healthy chunk of what it is that our shareholders expect from us. [Rev. Lawson] It is written in the New Testament, "The love of money is the root of all evil." This does not say that money itself is evil. The fact that I shared a room with Tom Schoewe, our C.F.O., while we were in New York, saved $200. The fact that my dinner was $10 last night saved money. [Rabbi Jacobs] You shall not steal. Doesn't this teach us that keeping everything for ourselves is a form of stealing, or are we commanded to help those less fortunate to find enough to eat? Today I want you to know, however, that five members of that family together are worth $102 billion. The widow and four children have, in the last 20 years, emerged on the list of the top ten wealthiest people in the United States. They could easily take ten billion of that and see to it that every employee of Wal-Mart in the United States has healthcare, adequate pension, and adequate wages. Wal-Mart, after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, they apparently decided that they needed to have a bunker. There's a facility for the Walton family in case of an apocalyptic attack, a residence that they can live in in case they had to do that. There's a helipad behind the facility back there where they can come in by helicopter, and there are satellite uplink dishes behind the facility. Most of it is underground, as you can see. You can't really see much from the gate, which is all fortified. Faith means nothing at all if it does not involve us loving one another as neighbors, in compassion for the poor... [woman] When you hear these bells at Wal-Mart, do you remember the people they're ringing for? They remind us of our friends and neighbors who could use a little help. That's why at Wal-Mart we give back... ...throughout the holidays and all year long. Of course, the most important beneficiary of this store is our customer. It's a customer who lives in that neighborhood. I was actually selling cars for six months, but prior to that, I actually had my own business. I was doing wood refinishing on boats. And I actually did quite well at that. Getting a little too old for that. [laughs] You know, if I was going to go through all that I went through, I wanted something to come out of it, something good. There was a truck to one side. There was a van to one side. I thought, you know, I've always said, you know, "You don't want to be in the spot where nobody can see you." But I thought, "Four car spaces from the front door." And I thought they had security outside. Okay, well, "I should be fine." When I got out, there was two of them. Unfortunately, he caught me. I got outside, but he caught me. And that's when I realized he had a gun. He had a gun in the arm that was holding me. That's when they told me, "Get back in the car or I'm gonna blow your head off." The year before when I worked at the phone company, we had a safety meeting. And it was around Christmastime, and they had the Sheriff's department there. And they were talking about if you're in a parking lot and this happens, what to do, don't go with them. If you go with them, you're likely not going to live, because, I guess, statistically, that's what happens. They'll kill you. That's what first went through my mind, is that, "I'm not going to survive this." Sorry. So that's why, you know, the decision to jump out, because I thought, "I want to choose." I thought they were going to rape me, too. When he said he didn't want the car, I thought they were going to rape me. So, when they got me back in the car and after looking at the gun, I just kind of resigned to, you know... There was nothing I could do. And you go kind of cold inside. This is the parking lot where Laura Tanaka faced her attackers. Inside the store, Wal-Mart had more than 200 security cameras and four security guards on patrol. Outside, there was nothing. The police did recommend on-site security. There was none. They had assured the people of the neighborhood that they would provide armed security and make sure it was safe for the neighborhood. That wasn't done. It was evident that Wal-Mart knew they had substantial problems in their parking lots. Wal-Mart was aware that the majority of the crime throughout the states occurred in their parking lots. Despite the fact that 80% of the crime occurred in their parking lots, they had done almost nothing to protect the customers in the lots. Rape, murder, kidnapping, all of these shocking allegations, and they come from Wal-Mart shoppers. [woman] Report of a Wal-Mart parking-lot attack. Tonight, North Texas police are on the hunt for a would-be kidnapper. A violent attack in the parking lot of an Orange County Wal-Mart. At least one man tried to carjack, rob, and shoot a woman. [man] ...who shot and killed 33-year-old Mark Korenek in the store's parking lot. A bold and deadly shooting. It happened this morning at the Wal-Mart... A Taylor woman is recovering tonight after fighting a thief in a Wal-Mart parking lot. [woman] A man is arrested after a tire-iron attack. It happened in the parking lot of this Wal-Mart. [woman 2] The two teenage workers shot while gathering carts in the parking lot yesterday at this Glendale Wal-Mart. [woman 3] It happened at 1:48 this morning in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Riverdale. She turned to run from the subject and was shot in the back. [woman] Wal-Mart has conducted research on crime in its parking lots, and critics accuse the company of a nationwide pattern of covering up that research, of failing to turn it over in lawsuits. Here's what Wal-Mart did not want to show. As early as 1994, as you can see in this internal document, a Wal-Mart study showed that 80% of crime at Wal-Mart locations occurred in the parking lot. And when the company added roving patrols at several sites, the crime rate dropped to as low as zero. A district judge in Beaumont tonight is fining Wal-Mart stores $18 million. Judge James Mahathy is sanctioning Wal-Mart for what the court believes was a pattern of deception. It involves the case of a Southeast Texas woman who was sexually assaulted and raped in the parking lot of Wal-Mart. The court found that Wal-Mart did not disclose that it had conducted a safety study, a study that found if Wal-Mart would put employees in golf carts patrolling its parking lots, crime there would drop to zero. [Stahl] Judge Sherilyn Wood heard a case against Wal-Mart in Houston, Texas, in 1999 involving an assault in a Wal-Mart parking lot. She says that in 17 years on the bench and over 25,000 cases, she's rarely seen such flagrant abuse of the system. It was very disturbing to see such an intentional course of conduct. It was corrupt. [Stahl] She's charging Wal-Mart with cheating in court. And she's not the only one. This is one judge. "Is there something in the drinking water in Arkansas that says perjury is all right?" Another judge: "Rarely has this court seen such a pattern "of deliberate obfuscation, delay, misrepresentation, and downright lying." True. [Fortune] Unfortunately for the customer, they really don't care what goes on after you spend your money in there and come out into the parking lot to go home. [man] Police found Holden shot to death along the side of a road in Stanton, Texas, 400 miles from where she was abducted. [Kirkpatrick] Megan was very special. We grew up together. We lived together. She's really, really gonna be missed a whole lot because she has a lot of people that love her. She was just a very sweet person and... She never wanted a whole lot out of life. But she just wanted to live and, you know, be happy. That's all she wanted. Just recently, before she died, we were in her room listening to a CD. We were singing together. And we could just be open with each other. We didn't care. [man] Police say Megan Holden was chosen at random on the way to her pickup truck in the Wal-Mart parking lot just before midnight. After that crime was caught on surveillance video, police say Williams, a marine veteran with a history of drug offenses, sped off in Holden's truck, heading west, where he apparently murdered the 19-year-old junior-college student and dumped her body near some railroad tracks in the West Texas town of Stanton. I just think that there's a lot of things Wal-Mart could have done. There should be somebody watching the cameras. Somebody should have been watching the cameras. Wal-Mart has those cameras out there in their parking lot, and I thought that they were watching. [man] A security camera without someone watching it is of no use at all. The abduction and murder that happened in Texas happened at a store where the loss-prevention team was sent in to set up a security system outside that would track the union activity in that store. And the only reasons that they had the pictures that they did was because they had the union package on the outside of the store. Wal-Mart focuses on protecting their property and not their patrons. A multi-million dollar company. Couldn't you pay someone like $12 an hour to watch a camera? If people are putting profits before safety, they're putting profits before human life, I don't think there's anything you can say to them. [woman] A man is suing a Wal-Mart in Newcastle, saying his mother died after a botched robbery attempt in the store's parking lot. [man] The random shooting happened here. That three people are dead and three others injured... [reporters speaking] The shooting happened in the middle of a busy shopping day. At least one man tried to carjack, rob, and shoot a woman. Report of a Wal-Mart parking lot attack... Tonight, North Texas police are on the hunt for a would-be kidnapper. -A bold and deadly shooting... -A shooting rampage... Random shooting... -A bold and deadly shooting... -It just happened this morning. The shooting happened... Tonight, North Texas police are on the hunt for a would-be kidnapper. A Wal-Mart store has a responsibility to society to make sure that what we do fits in and represents what it is society expects from a big company. We need to figure out how do we, in fact, work together to cause them to want to have a Wal-Mart. [Laney] On December 6th, there was an article on the front page of our local paper, and it said that Wal-Mart was going to build a supercenter on the corner of Queen Creek and Almond School, which is just a very short distance from my house. And this particular location was within our planned community, and it was within walking distance of an elementary school and a junior high school. And I felt that it was an inappropriate location for something of that magnitude. So I decided to form a campaign and say, "No Wal-Mart in our neighborhood." [Rev. Perez] Living as Christ has taught us, we begin to transform the world. This transformation is visible in the reading that we have from Acts. We're really trying to show why the work that we're doing is the work of the gospel. The lesson we learned in Inglewood is that we have the ability, through our democracy, to take power and take control and actually hold big companies accountable. As a nation in this world, the most powerful, the most affluent, we have the power to make sure that all have what they need, that this is not some pie-in-the-sky vision, but instead, that this is our call, as Christians, to make this happen. [Laney] One of my neighbors and I went and hand-made some little posters and we decided that we were going to have a meeting in the local park, which was about a block from here. We had no idea how many people would show up. We were absolutely amazed, and all of them wanted to do something. [Rev. Perez] In the beginning, it was only a few of us. Not a lot of people came to the meetings, only some supermarket workers and a couple of churches. And then more people until they started feeling the pressure. They wanted to build the Wal-Mart on this whole parcel. It was going to be 215,000 square feet. And there was going to be... Wal-Mart was going to take this whole space. It's like 17 football fields big. And they were going to build one big box that was Wal-Mart and then little stores in between and another big box that was Sam's Club. [Laney] People volunteered to do the various chores that we had, and then we solicited what I call a core committee, and that was a group of people who would be responsible for the strategy, the press releases, everything that needed to be done to organize our campaign. [Rev. Perez] Then the coalition started getting bigger, and before you knew it, everybody felt like, if they weren't part of a coalition for a better Inglewood, they weren't standing up to defend the community. [Aparicio] The other lesson learned in Inglewood is that there's no kind of magic potion to suddenly... You click this, you put this together, and suddenly you're going to win. It's a hard process. There are a lot of things that have to come in place. But when you put those things in place, you can win. It includes the ability to organize regular people, small-business owners, workers... We got our message focused. We hammered away on the phones, hammered away on doors. People saw us coming and going when they went to church and every time they went to a store in Inglewood, there was a flyer about our effort. We held rallies. It was legal strategy. Enough resources to have the research to be able to make your case, to be able to have the materials. It includes the ability to get out your message to the press, to do media events. [Laney] We grew to 187 volunteers, and we had block captains, and we had area chairmen. We proceeded to gather signatures on our petitions, and we started out with 1,500 signatures. And by the time we got through, we had 4,000 signatures. And they were all from people within our... What I call our area code. Our zip code. Zip code. I always get the two mixed up. Zip code. [man] Inglewood is the first test for Wal-Mart's ambitious plans in California, and activists say the stakes here are huge. This is like "Godzilla Eats Tokyo." This is much bigger than David and Goliath. All of the information coming from Wal-Mart kept saying, "It's a done deal. "There's nothing you can do about it. "We have our zoning. Don't waste your time." But [chuckles] we knew better. Then we had numerous public meetings to let the public know what was happening, what the status was. It is not like they came into the small towns in the south or towns that have no business and they brought in business. No. This is something completely different. They represent, from Bentonville, Arkansas, plantation capitalism. The future of this community depends on our ability to stop the monster in its tracks. [man] Wal-Mart sponsored the ballot initiative after Inglewood's city council opposed building a Wal-Mart supercenter on the site. Today, Wal-Mart opponents charged the initiative, Measure 4A, hijacks the city's planning process. It is 71 pages of legal fine print that seeks to cut the community out of its own development process. [Hutchinson] What they did was essentially tell the city of Inglewood, "Get out of here. "We are the biggest corporation in the world. We can go in and essentially buy an election." [Laney] We held public meetings. We did our letters. We held private meetings with city council members. We were out on the street and doing the work to ensure the people understood that to those who much has been given, much will be expected. I'm sure the Walton family believes that they're a good Christian family. But I think they have made millions at the expense of poor workers. And I'm sure there's a lot of people that think that they're good Christian companies. Not if they're going to make money off the backs of people who are suffering. [Laney] A lot of people sacrificed an awful lot to have all the freedoms that we have. And that flag, to me, represents all of our freedoms. Our freedom to fight Wal-Mart. Our freedom to live where we want to, work where we want to... Have a say in our government. They can say and believe whatever they want about, you know, trickle-down theories of capital and whatever other nonsense they want to invent to hold on to their capital. But as Christians, we don't have that option. That's not our option. That we're not about capital, that we're about people. [Laney] We came before the city council for the final vote, and the council voted 6-0 to deny Wal-Mart and Best Star, the developer, the right to build the store on that property. [man] Residents of Inglewood, California, are voting today on whether to approve the construction of a new shopping development dominated by Wal-Mart. [Rev. Perez] We gathered at a local restaurant hoping for a miracle, but braced to go back to court if the measure passed. [woman] And now, the votes are coming in on a proposed Wal-Mart super store in Inglewood. -3,100... -[cheers and applause] [woman] This small group of people took on a giant and won and it was really meaningful, because nobody thought we could win this. We didn't think we could win. David beat Goliath! David beat Goliath! David beat Goliath! The city council of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, handed Wal-Mart their hat today. Wal-Mart packs its bags in Cobb County, Georgia. Community resistance paid off in Hickory, North Carolina. Wal-Mart hit the road. Anti-Wal-Mart candidates sweep the Helotes, Texas election. Another trip down the long and dusty for Wal-Mart in Biloxi, Mississippi. When you have a group of people, a small group of people, who don't want you in the community, does that mean you're not gonna go there? Thornton, Colorado, defeated Wal-Mart. -Wal-Mart beaten... -Wal-Mart loses to Plainfield, Illinois. -Las Vegas, Nevada, defeated Wal-Mart. -Victory in Maine... When you have a group of people, a small group of people, who don't want you... Don't want you in the community... Wal-Mart loses to Charlevoix, Michigan. Neighborhood fights off proposed Wal-Mart store. Wal-Mart beaten. Wal-Mart loses to Chicago, Illinois. Wal-Mart zoned off from Flagstaff, Arizona. Arlington, Texas, rejects Wal-Mart. Victory in Colchester, Connecticut. Success. Centerville, Utah. Victory. Harrison, New Jersey. An anti-Wal-Mart slate was elected to city council in Deptford, New Jersey. Voters rejected Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. The Wal-Mart man? Defeated. In Glendora, California. Wal-Mart beaten in Medford, Oregon. Who's going to take the picture, you? [man] One million people a year visit Washington's adult home in Mount Vernon. On this President's Day, there was disbelief that anyone would dream of disturbing his boyhood home. Because there's plenty of places for a shopping center, but there's only one Washington Farm. [man] Surveyors have already marked off the property line for the Wal-Mart. [woman] No. That's history. They shouldn't destroy people's history like that. [woman] May 29th, a Hawaiian group sued, claiming Wal-Mart and the state violated grave-desecration laws and public trust. Where do you get off coming here, you know, a foreign... What if it was their great-grandfather that was desecrated? For now, the remains are being stored in a trailer below a ramp leading to a parking garage at Wal-Mart. [man] We put a sign up in the Worthington, Minnesota store that was ten feet over the city code there. And the building inspector red-tagged it. And the next thing I know, there's an overnight-- They call me and tell me there's an overnight package coming for me and I'm to take it to this person. The envelope wasn't sealed. And so I just opened it up, and there's a $10,000 check. And I gave it to the individual, and the very next day, the red tag's off the sign. When you have a group of people, a small group of people, who don't want you in a community, does that mean you're not gonna go there?
