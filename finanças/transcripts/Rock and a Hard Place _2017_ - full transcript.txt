Subtitles by explosiveskull So, you're probably thinking right now, "What the fuck have I gotten myself into?" I understand that. When I was your age, I was getting in trouble. When I was your age, I started getting arrested. I know what it's like to fuck up. I know what it's like thinking nobody gives a shit. Everybody in this room... they care. They're gonna dog you, they're gonna smoke you, they're gonna break you down. But no one here is gonna fucking break, you understand? Sir, yes, sir! I know this boot camp program. I believe in it. And I want the world to see the importance of this program. I want the world to see how powerful this program is. Show you something. Look at this. That's your new life. That's what you look like. You may not be able to see it right now. You can't visualize it in your head, but the day is gonna come, and it's gonna come like that... where it's graduation. - You understand? - Sir, yes, sir! No quitting. Stay strong... and don't fuck this thing up. I mean that. His charges are very serious. He's facing up to life in prison. You're going into the boot camp program as an alternative to 20 years in prison. We don't have many second chances, but you've been granted one. Don't squander this opportunity because there will be no other. When you get to boot camp, it's gonna be the shock of your life. We are gonna beat that demon out of you that had you on the streets committing crimes. Let's go! Welcome to Miami-Dade County Boot Camp! Let them off! Let's go! - Get them off! - Move, move, move! Hurry up! Get off the bus! Hurry up! Do not freakin' eyeball me, you understand? - I say something, you say something! - Yes, sir! Aye, sir! - That's a freaking, "Aye, sir!" - Yes, sir! Aye, sir! Aye, sir! I say something, you say something. Don't look at me! Get them out. Let's hurry up, hurry up. Quickly, let's go! I said... Go! Let's go, let's go! Today! Let's go! Every... hey, let's go! - Hurry up! Come on, let's go! - Get them off! This is not easy. It is not personal. We have one mission and one mission only. That's to take you from boys to men. Somebody your mama can be proud of, somebody your daddy can be proud of. You're gonna cry sometime tonight. You're gonna sweat some tears, trust me. Your body ain't gonna be able to take what we're gonna dish out. I already know it. You tried it your way all this time. Look how far it got you. This is where your way got you. If you want different results, you gotta do different things. If you want the same results, do the same thing! - On your feet! - Sir, yes, sir! 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. Sir, yes, sir! Fall in, fall in, fall in. Give me two lines, give me two lines. Break off and give me another line in the front. Let's go. If you still got the street mentality, hey, you ain't gonna freaking make it in here. You're not gonna freaking make it by yourself. You need friggin' teamwork to make it through this friggin' program. If you ain't got no friggin' teamwork, you better find some real quick. - Do you understand that? - Sir, yes, sir! Right face! For those of you who haven't met me, I am your primary drill instructor, Officer Drill Instructor Fouquet. - You understand that, trash? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am! I'ma also go ahead and introduce Corporal Hodge and Drill Instructor Officer Lopez. Platoon, attention! Everybody get into push-up position. Aye, sir. Every time you stinking freaking move at the position of attention, you're gonna go freaking pay for it. - Down! - Discipline. - Up! - Two, sir. - Down! - Discipline. - Louder! - Three, sir. - Get on up. - Aye, sir. Five, four, three, two, and freaking one. Yes, sir. Now, I highly recommend you do not move at the position of attention or you're gonna do push-up after darn push-up till you explode. - You understand me? - Sir, yes, sir! Why are you moving? Didn't I tell you at the position of attention that I would punish you? You... you can have a... you can smile if you want. You can smile if you want. If you want, I'll put the cuffs on you right now. Now, you want that, it's on stinkin' you. So go ahead and stinking smile again. Smile again! How many years are you facing? - He wanna freaking die like that? - Get him out of the squad room. We don't need him. Get him out of the squad room. Does anybody else wanna go back to freaking jail? - Sir, no, sir. - Good. I hope you're inspired. Dukes, you don't wanna be here no more? Do we need to call the paddy wagon? I'm talking to you. Hello? I'm talking to you. Sir, I wanna leave, but then... and then I don't wanna leave. You can't have both. Either you're gonna be here or you're freaking rolling up out of here. Guess what. You think all them other cadets up there wanna be there? I'm pretty sure they freaking don't. Instead of doing four months of boot camp, you'd rather go to prison? Tell me, what's different in prison? You're gonna eat when they tell you to friggin' eat. You're gonna go to freaking rec or whatever the freak you gonna do when they tell you to do it. It's not gonna be at your freaking leisure. Everything gonna be on they freaking agenda. Nothing on your freaking agenda. You understand that, right? - Sir, yes, sir. - All right. So, you need a moment to get yourself together, 'cause I can tell you right now you're not going nowhere, Dukes, so you might as well put your little game face on and do what the freak you gotta do. - It's real simple. - Sir, yes, sir. All right, get to the end of the hall. - Aye, sir. - Aye, sir. He just going through that thing that all the cadets go through initially... that shock of incarceration, of all the yelling and the screaming, and they're not used to conforming to that environment. Sir, yes, sir! I wanna welcome you to Miami-Dade County Boot Camp program. You had no discipline in the streets. You didn't have a job, you didn't go to school, disrespected your community. So, now things are gonna change. There's nothing easy about the freaking boot camp program. Why don't you take a seat? They never get to talk during a meal. They don't do nothing but sit down and eat their food. Once they're done eating, they're back awaiting their next command. Aye, sir! Aye, sir! A lot of you guys still got trash on my deck and y'all standing there holding my freaking broom. Let's go! - Ready? 10 mule kicks right now! - Aye, sir. One, sir, two, sir, three, sir, four, sir... The push-ups, the sit-ups, the in-your-face screaming, that's all a part of our philosophy. If they can't survive in here, they'll never make it on the street. Run in there. Go now. - Let's go! Get in there, let's go! - Hurry up! - Hurry up. - Turn on the showers. Let's go! Quick, quick. Hurry up, let's go. Let's go. You better not freakin' freak this up. I don't know who told you you can look at me! Aye, sir! - Aye, sir. - Aye, sir! I can't hear you! Aye, sir! Aye, sir. - Let's go, quickly. - Aye, sir. Quickly, quickly. Aye, sir. - No, sir. - Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Hey, hey, hey, don't pass by me - and not say nothing. - Sorry, sir. Don't pass by me and don't friggin' say nothing. Sir, good evening, sir. - I can't hear you. - Sir, good evening, sir! - Sir, good evening, sirs. - Okay, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Get on the freaking line, let's go. Five, four, three, two, and stinking one. Yes, sir! - Now, ears. - Open, sir. - Ears. - Open, sir. We're not freaking here to God dadgum freaking cater to you. At the end of the day, you're in God dadgum freaking jail. So, whatever you get is what the freak you get. All I can tell you is you shouldn't have brought your freaking tail to jail. So, oh, freaking well. - You understand that? - Sir, yes, sir. - Get in the rack. Do it now! - Aye, sir. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14. Get in the rack. You're on top of the rack. Get your tail in the rack! Lay back! You better play like you're freaking dead. Let's go, let's go, let's go. You ain't at the God dadgum beach. You ain't at your mama house. They've been going nonstop for 15, 16 plus hours. They'll sleep real good tonight. So, tomorrow is a new day, so they'll wake up fresh, ready to go for day two of 120 days to go. To be honest, it's not a bad group at all. It ain't really that bad of a group. We still have everyone, so that's pretty good. - That's unheard of. - It's going fine. Normally, by now, we'd at least be at a loss of one, at least. Came in with 38 cadets, we have the opportunity to leave with 38 cadets. - That will never happen. - Never. - Never ever. - I'll make sure of that. Somebody... somebody got to go. - The rest of us will do it. - Somebody got to go. Somebody gotta quit. All right, get everyone out! Let's go! Wake up! Get on up! - Get on up. Do it now. - Aye, sir. Now get on up. Do it now. Get up! Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Five, four... get down. - Three, two... - Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. ...and one. - Go, sir, go. - I can't hear you. - And one! - Go, sir, go. - Push-up, move. - Aye, sir. Get down, get down, get down, get down. Let's go. Down, up. Down, all the way up. Down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up. ...three, two, and one. - Go, sir, go. - And one. Go, sir, go. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. Your left, your right, your left, your right, your left, right, left. Your left, your right, your left, your right, your left, right, left. Hey, hey! Prepare for formal headcount. Prepare for formal headcount, aye, ma'am! Now, for a formal headcount, that's when you let me know that you're here. - You understand, trash? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. I'm gonna say your last name. You're gonna say your first name and your jail number. Everything starts with ma'am, everything ends with ma'am. - Do you understand that, trash? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Cadet Cordero, what's my jail number? 5163. How about 1-5...? - Uh, 1... - Calm down. - 1-5... - 1-5... - ...6-5... - ...6-5... - ...3-6. - ...3-6. 1-5... what's the rest of it? - Uh, no, ma'am. - Oh, you don't know. You don't know your freaking jail number?! You don't know what is your freaking jail number?! How long you been in freaking jail and, no, you don't know your freaking jail number?! He no speak no Inglés, Drew. Go over there, push, and repeat your damn jail number till you remember it. Hurry up, hurry up! Get there, get there! - Ray Gonzalez. - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Gonzalez. No speak English. Y'all don't say numbers in Spanish? Do you understand that, trash? - You speak Spanish? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Okay, ask him what's his jail number. He doesn't know it, ma'am. Oh, okay, not that he don't speak no damn English, he just don't goddamn know it. You're gonna start reading all my freaking trash. I don't know if you really understand or no, but you're gonna get it. You're gonna pay every freaking day! You're gonna push every day until I get tired, and I never get tired. - You understand that, trash? - Aye, sir. Get in the freaking line! - Y'all like me now? - Aye, ma'am. - Five, four, three, two, and one. - Go, ma'am, go. - And one. - Go, ma'am, go. I'm very scared, man. I just wanna go home. Chew, keep looking forward. Look forward, head and eyes, sir. You got a problem with eyeballing or is it that you blind, you can't hear, you deaf? What is it? You gotta look at the friggin' doggone drill instructor? - No, ma'am. - Because head and eyes straight forward. Get your head up! Why the freak we keep coming to you? You don't need to nod your head, dummy. Just open your freaking doggone sucker. I say something, "Aye, ma'am." - Aye, aye, ma'am. - And you spit it out. Aye, ma'am, aye, ma'am, aye, ma'am. You've been running in and out of jail probably half of your friggin' doggone life. You know what? Matter of fact, just go right to that little corner over there. Face this little hole right here. Face this little hole right there. Face the little friggin' doggone hole. That's where the freak you belong. Now, anything else fucking funny? Ma'am, no, ma'am! You know what? Speak freely. - Sir, I... - Relax. Shh. - Speak freely. - Olsen came up to me and bumped me. And I turned around and seen that he bumped me, and he like, "Hurry up. Get out of here." - What's going on? - Stop, stop, stop. Listen to me. - Listen to me. - I'm trying to do right, sir. - I'm doing everything... - I'm talking now. I'm talking now. - Sir, yes, sir. - You're gonna stop what you're doing right now. - Sir, yes, sir. - You're gonna go back in there, you're gonna continue on with this because you have everything to lose. - Do you understand me? - Sir, yes, sir. Okay, so right now, you just gotta take it. Grow some thick skin. - That's the way it is around here. - Sir, I'm not... No, that's it. I have nothing more to say. I'm telling you what you have to do. - I'm giving you the tools. - Come here, you! - Do you understand me? - Sir, yes, sir. - Good. Get over there. - Come here, you! Sir, yes, sir. Aye, yes, sir. Drop your freaking canteen and freaking push. Aye, sir. Crazy, man. Give 'em to me and freakin' push, maggot! - Get down there! - Crazy, man. - Shut up and just freaking push. - You better hurry up. You better sound off at the top of your lungs like I told you. You understand? - ...two, sir, three, sir... - They think... they think that this is a joke. They think when they come over here, it's gonna be a joke. Get up, get up, get up, get up. ...five, four, three, two, and freaking one. - Go, sir! - And one. No matter what the drill instructor does, you have to freaking follow protocol and do what you're supposed to do. If I'm doing right and y'all gonna keep putting me back in the system... and keep trying me... You know what? Guess what, guess what. You're gonna be freaking pushing, then I'm gonna be pushing. Oh, I'm pushing, man? Shut up! Shut up! Let me know when you're ready to join the rest of the platoon. ...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. He started popping off 'cause somebody got in his face. You know? It's gonna be a continuous thing. - He can't have it, so. - What you mean by popping off? Disrespectful, you know? - Cursing... - He used profanity? Yeah, throwing his hands up. Okay, so we'll use the chain of command. Let's have someone speak with him and come on up the chain of command and make a determination of what we're gonna do with him. Our job ain't to get rid of you. Our job is to fix you. Okay? But you gotta wanna help yourself first. Grow up. It's not cute. It's not funny. You have a decision to make. You're not gonna be in timeout forever. You're not, Chew. Chew, you're turning your head, you're moving. You're doing all what you wanna do. That's why you over here. Every day, somebody gotta be talking to you. - Every hour on the hour. - Let's go. This mother pissed me the hell off! Chew, you back. What happened? Why you back? Why you gotta keep coming back to this holding cell? - Yeah, I'm trying, man. - Chew, do it for you and do it for your mom and do it for your family. Aye, sir! - Aye, sir. - You sound so beautiful. You wanna smile in front of a drill instructor? That's what you wanna do? Shut the freak up, man! Let's go. You gotta go. Let's go. Get him out of here. Everyone else spoke to him and told him it's not a joke. Either you conform to the program or we're gonna remove you from the program. - How many times you been arrested, son? - Couple... a couple times. - And how old are you? - 21. So, a couple is a lot for a 21-year-old, son. So, how much time we need to give you? Another 10 days, another five days? - How much time do you need? - No, ma'am. I don't need no more days, ma'am. I'm debating his life. You know, you try to help these young men, and sometimes they can't get out of their own way. That's what I'm thinking. So, part of me says he's trying, but the other part of me is saying that he's just playing games and going through the motions. This is an intense program. They chose boot camp, we did not choose them. They signed to be here, they agreed to be here, so if you gonna be here, you not gonna waste my time, you gonna not... you not gonna waste my freaking fellow drill instructors' time, you not gonna waste the other cadets' time that's trying to change they freaking life. So, if you feel like you gonna slow the program, we gotta get you out of the freaking program. You're damn right. All right, Chew, you know you're being removed from the program. Now, you're being charged with using abusive or aggressive language or gestures, aggravated refusal to follow written or verbal orders from the staff. - You understand that? - Sir, yes, sir. Boot camp ain't for nobody, man. That's something I knew, man. - How are you, ma'am? - Ma'am, good afternoon, ma'am. Ma'am, good afternoon, ma'am! He said that she's... she looks sexy. He said that. - Look, Cordero. - Nah. - Good afternoon, everybody. - Good afternoon, ma'am. My name is Mrs. Jackson. I'm your counselor for boot camp. Mr. Johnson is also a counselor here. If you have any questions, I'll answer them once I call you up. Aye, ma'am. Cadet Jules. What were your primary charges? Two armed robberies, two strong-arm, one grand theft. Got a high school diploma? Ma'am, no, ma'am. Manuel Cordero. - Sir, good afternoon, sir. - Okay, have a seat. Good afternoon. Counselor Johnson. How do you pronounce your last name? Oh, I don't speak English. - No comprende in English? - No. Oh. What are your charges? Two armed robberies, ma'am. - Do you have any kids? - Sir, yes, sir. - How many? - One, sir. - Girl or boy? - Boy, sir. The first time you got arrested, how old were you? 13. Aye, sir! How many times you been arrested? - In total? - Over five? - 15, 20. - 15 to 20 times. They like running you guys through the system without actually helping y'all. I don't understand it. All right. A recycle is an individual that's been sentenced to boot camp, and, for whatever reason, we have a one-time opportunity to kick them out and bring them back. This is Timothy Williams. He's a special case. He's been kicked out not once, but twice. This is his last opportunity here in this program, so hopefully he's learned his lesson. Williams, let's go. This is my third time here. - Everybody don't get lucky like that. - Mm-mm. So, therefore, why I gotta come here... Because why am I wasting my time on you, Williams? Like you said, you've been here three times. Everybody get three times? Everybody don't get no... some people don't get two times. My point exactly. Everybody don't have the same judge that you have. 'Cause you could've been up the road serving your six years. The prison life. So, you wanna be here? I wanna be here so I can go home. - To do what? - Change. Oh, okay, 'cause that's the biggest issue right now... change, not just to go home. - I respect that. - All right. - Let's go. - Aye, ma'am. How's everybody? - Good. - Good? I'm from the central center. I'm an anger management facilitator. The object of this class is to make you very much aware of what happens to you prior to you becoming angry. I want to know what you experience when you get agitated. I'm gonna start over here. - I clench my teeth. - Good. Very good. My head gonna hurt 'cause I be thinking too much of what I wanna do. - You get a headache? - Yeah. - It feels like my heart drops, like... - Mm. ...I just pop. Once you start feeling the heat, once you start clenching your teeth, that's your warning sign. Do not ignore your yellow light. - This is your ticket to not coming back here. - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. A lot of us ain't built mentally to... built like this place. Like, the stuff that goes down in here, like, in this program. Mm-hmm. When you do get out, this stuff, you ain't gonna be able to... like, I think... I think most people, when they get out, they ain't gonna be able to cooperate right. This is a form of rehabilitation/ punishment. - Okay? - I understand that, but how long can you keep saying, "Cope with that"? Till... you cope with it until you get out of here. - That's true. - Cope with it. Knees bent and a 30-inch step with your left foot, sir. You're stepping off 30 inches with the left foot. You're leaning back. You're not just saying things to say them. You're saying it so you can remind yourself what it is I expect you to do. - Do you understand me? - Sir, yes, sir. You guys are not following what we're saying, you're not paying attention. - Are you ready? - Go! Go! That's what I'm talking about, God damn it. Boot camp. It's like marching a bunch of zombies! You've got 15, 14... line up on the other side. Quickly, quickly! Four, three, two, and... If you put nothing into it... you get nothing out of it. - Start freaking pushing! - You better say something! You better say, "Aye, sir!" - Oh! - Did I hurt your feelings? - Get on up! Do it now! - Sir, yes, sir! - Let's go. - Hurry up! Dukes! Hey, Dukes! I'm sure they're very fatigued, ready for us to lay off, but that's not in our nature, so we're fitting to come tough or come harder. They have to learn how to maintain control and discipline regardless of what happens at boot camp. There's a method to the madness. Left, right! Pick it up and fix that. What are you doing?! I never told you to throw the locker! Did I tell you to throw a locker? Did I tell you to throw a locker? Did I tell you to throw a damn locker? - Get him out of here. - Get outside. - He's ready to go. - What seems to be the problem, Wimbley? You letting them friggin' doggone creeps rub off on you so you wanna go home? Is that what the freak you wanna do, Wimbley? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. - Oh, you wanna go home? You wanna leave? You wanna go do prison? You getting in your feelings, Wimbley? You better fight whatever devil that's in your friggin' doggone grape. Do you understand that? One thing you'll never do, you'll never lose your military bearing with no drill instructor. Go ahead, you. I got him. Take off. Sit down. Sit down, sit down. What you upset about? Talk to me. Speak freely. This is your time to speak freely. There ain't no more drill instructors in the back. Speak freely. - What's on your mind, son? - I'ma be on that, cleaning and shit. I'm gonna do what I gotta do. I don't want nobody in my face with all that asking, answering. If I'm doing what I'm supposed to do, man, would you let me be? I'm invisible. Hey, come on. Come on. Not talking to Corporal? Not right now. We started with 38, we lost two, and we've lost one more cadet. I don't know if y'all remember Cadet Wimbley. See, that's the face. He's not gonna be coming back with the platoon. Down to 35. Let's focus on the 35 and let's move forward. - Okay? - Not a problem. - Sounds good. - All right. What is this guy's name that he's not speaking English that well? I know enough to do personal hygiene with him. - Uh, which one? - Gonzalez, Francisney. Okay, and the other one is... Here's the other one... Cordero. They just picking up a little slower than others. They gonna either get better at what they're doing or we're gonna keep pushing them. That's all we can do, is keep pushing them. Aye, sir. Lean back and take a 30-inch step with the left foot, sir. - Aye, sir. - Aye, sir. - All the way to the squad bay. - Aye, ma'am. "Aye, ma'am. Aye, ma'am." I need it friggin' doggone quiet. Left, right. Forward, march. - What's your name there, you? - Sir, Cadet Terrell, sir. - You sure, right? - Sir, yes, sir! - You've been doing real good, ain't you? - Aye, sir! - People talking good about you. - Aye, sir! - Good job. Get away. - Aye, sir! Sir, good afternoon, sir! What's your name there, you? - Yo-ho! - Sir, Cadet Williams, sir. - Williams? - Yes, sir. That you, Williams? - That you, Williams? - Aye, sir. Oh, snap!

What about you? What's your name? Sir, Cadet Youngblood requesting permission to speak, sir. - Youngblood. - Aye, sir. I don't know you, Youngblood. - I know you, Youngblood? - Sir, no, sir. - I smoked you before, Youngblood? - Sir, no, sir. So that means you must be doing good if I don't know you. Aye, sir. I know that nasty Williams over there, - but I don't know you. - Aye, sir. - How old are you, boy? - Cadet Youngblood requesting permission to speak, sir. - Speak. - Aye, sir. 19, sir. - 19? - Sir, yes, sir. So, you 19 years old, you ain't get in no trouble. That's good. - Aye, aye, sir. - Yeah, that's real good. - Sir, yes, sir. - Good job there, you. - Aye, aye, sir. - Now, what kind of aspirations and goals you got? Aye, aye, sir. So, this cadet wants to graduate from this program, sir, and enroll in a trade school and learn culinary, sir. - Culinary? - Sir, yes, sir. - You're trying to be a chef for real, huh? - Sir, yes, sir. - That sounds like a chef. That don't sound like a cook. - Aye, sir. - Where would you like to work? - Aye, sir. So, this cadet wants to work at... - IHOP or Denny's, sir. - IHOP? - That boy like to eat. - You selling yourself. Why are you selling yourself? IHOP and Denny's. Nothing wrong with them. I go there, I eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner at different times of the day. - Depends on when I'm hungry. - Aye, ma'am. - But aspire your goals for a top restaurant. - Aye, ma'am. They have Houston's, we have... they have P.F. Chang's, they have, you know, Benihana. - You look like you got some things you wanna do. - Aye, aye, sir. All right, good job. Fall in. - Everybody turn to the left now. - Aye, sir. Congratulations. You've been selected for the technical course. That means that you have an opportunity to further educate yourself. Sir, will we still have a chance to get our GED while we're in this course, sir? Our priority is GED. - Do you understand me? - Sir, yes, sir! Make sure you keep your cord behind you. All of you will need to pass a GED test. 35 inches plus 24 inches. The first answer is 59 inches, man. Easy, man. - The rain in Spain... - Falls mainly on the plain. I am here to teach you reading, writing, and science. How many people do not have their high school diploma? Boot camp actually gives you opportunities to better yourself and to further your education. I'm here to get my GED and pay attention in class. I don't see boot camp in a bad way 'cause probably if it wasn't for boot camp, I would've been in prison right now, you know? That's not my life. That way there, you. Good job on that pivot. I see that car can drive. - Take seats. - Sir, yes, sir! Hi, guys. My name is Alex. You could call me whatever you want... Miss Alex, Alex. This is a substance abuse class. How many of you guys think that some type of drug was responsible for you being here today? - Yeah, ma'am. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Anyone wanna share a personal story? Go for it. Share. Okay. I took somebody's car and I dragged 'em. What happened? You did what? I took somebody's car... not knowing what I was doing 'cause I blacked out... and they were hanging onto the window, and I dragged them 25 feet. - Cadet Guzman! - Sir, cadet reporting, sir! - Report! - Get in here, you. - Aye, sir! - 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one.

Sir, this cadet's 12 general orders are to maintain the highest level of discipline and remain steady through my most trying times. - How about you open up my hands with that? - Aye, sir! 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. - Yes, sir. - Get over on the other side over there. - Aye, sir! - 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13... That's one of my sharpest cadets out of the whole platoon. He did exactly what he was supposed to do, so that's a pass for me. Hard work pays off. Prepare for mail call. Prepare for mail call. Aye, sir! - Listen out for your name. - Aye, sir! - Guzman. - Sir, Cadet Guzman reporting as ordered, sir. Aye, sir. Sir, afternoon, sir. - Bridgewater. - Sir, yes, sir. Sir, Cadet Bridgewater reporting as ordered, sir. - Aye, sir. Sir, good afternoon, sir. - Youngblood. Sir, yes, sir. Let's see. "Keno, don't hold on to the past. Plan to succeed. You will do fine. We know you can do it. Love, Dad." Even though I'm in jail, people still love me. Even though I've been locked up. Some of the people that used to write me don't write me no more, but he still do. So, my birthday had just passed, so my mom decided to send me a gift card. They can't wait till I get home, and, you know, I can't wait to unite with my family. I've been locked down for almost a year, and I ain't trying to waste no more time. I'm trying to get home and do the right thing. There's a letter from my sister saying that my mom's been going through a lot... a lot, that they tried to... they robbed her. And she was scared because they had my cousin and his friend with two guns in their heads. "The robbers looked nervous and shaky." Yeah, four... four guys robbed my mom. What you think would happen if you was out and they try to do that? I'll kill and die for my mom. I'll die and kill for my family. Like, that's family right there. This stuff happen like this, and the nigga hand shake. They don't think, they don't think. They just trying to get what they get and get up out of there. - Gotta be smarter than that. - Tsk, it's messed up. I wish I was out there. Nine. - No shit. - Eight. Back straight. - Back straight. - Oh, my God. - Hey, Plemons? - Sir, yes, sir! - Get over here. - Aye, sir.

Aye, ma'am. Ma'am, can I please have permission to speak, ma'am? - Oh, you speak it. - Aye, ma'am. This cadet's eighth general order is I will... I will respect the rights and property of all others, done and done. - On your feet. - Aye, ma'am. - Five, four, three... - Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Get ready. - Hurry up! - And run it out. - Hey, you wanna hang out with me? You wanna hang out? Get the hell out of here! Run, run! He's not exactly physically... He definitely not physically fit. No, but we're working on that. Nonetheless, he done made some... some type of improvement. And that's all we look for... on a day-to-day basis, some type of improvement as each day go by. - Close the hatch. - Aye, sir. Aye, sir. - Hello? - Hey, Mom. - Hey, baby. How are you? - I'm good. Yeah, we're all here... Grandma, Grandpa, and the dogs, too, but they're on... they're on lockdown. - Hi, Avery. - Hey, sis. A little birdy told me you was doing bad in school. Yeah, I'm doing horrible in school. That trash needs to tighten up. - You have one minute left. - Aye, sir. We got about one minute left, Ma. - Love you. - What? Love you! - Love you, too, Ma. Bye. - Okay. - Love you! - Blaine says, "Love you!" All right, love you, too, dawg. - All right, bye-bye. - Bye, Mom. - Hey, come here. - Yes, sir. - You got a nice family. - Sir, yes, sir. You don't feel the slightest bit bad about what the freak you did to get here? Sir, yes, sir. Does that picture of your mom ever hit you in the... Sir, yes, sir. How much do you love her? More than life itself, sir. - Say again. - More than life itself, sir. So, this should inspire you not to do anything wrong anymore. Sir, yes, sir. Your grandpa... your sister. Picture 'em in your head right now. Close your eyes. Think about how much you wanna be there and do stuff for them and... and make things right again. Now open up your eyes. Where are you right now? Sir, Dade County Boot Camp, sir. Okay. Where do you need to go? To go home, sir. So, between... between here and there is a journey you have to take to redeem yourself... - and to carry on with your life. - Sir, yes, sir. I'ma do it. I'ma complete this program. I'ma get home to my mom and my sister, my dad and my brother and my grandparents. I'm gonna get home... no matter what it takes. No matter how many push-ups, bend and thrusts, mule kicks. Whatever it takes. Sir, Cadet Cordero reporting as you ordered, sir. You're reporting as ordered? Is that what you're trying to say? - Sir, yes, sir. - Okay, sorry, sorry. - Reporting as ordered! - "Reportings" as ordered, sir. - Reporting as ordered! - Reportings as ordered, sir. Jeez, this guy's a numbskull. All right. Hey, enter. Aye, sir. To the rear march! Turn, step. Turn, step. Just march yourself into the wall. - No one told you to stop! - Keep marching into the wall. - Aye, sir. - I don't see you freaking marching. You ain't freaking marching. You're just following along with everybody, but you're not learning anything. You're following what they say. You're... you're freaking... you're trying to blend in with the crowd. - Aye, sir. - But it's not working. - Aye, sir. - Get the hell out of here. Aye, sir. Yeah, he fails. Get out! Get your trash! - Aye, sir. - Hurry the freak up. Get your trash. Get out of my classroom. Get out! Get out! - Get out! - Get out of here, failure. Get out of here, failure. He's just a failure in life, that's what he is. - Aye, sir. - You're just a failure in life. Have a nice day. He was unable to understand a lot of the... The language of what we were saying. You know, he has most of the protocol down right. He gots the protocol down. It's just that that language barrier is his big issue on trying to pass our... our test. So, the language barrier is the biggest problem. He's gotta learn English and he's gotta learn to follow the law and the rules and the regulations. If I was in his situation, I would like for somebody to help me. I look at him and I don't see malice. I just see confusion. You know, these kids just made a couple of stupid mistakes here and there, and I don't want him to lose hope. Left, right. Hup, ten, hup! - Hey, Williams, get over here! - Aye, ma'am. - Some time today. - Aye, ma'am. - Ma'am, good morning, ma'am. - Green over there yet? - Aye, ma'am. - Five, four, three, two, and freakin' one. - Have a seat. - Aye, ma'am. - Williams, this your third time here, right? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. - Still planning to get kicked out again? - Ma'am, no, ma'am. - You sure? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Boot camp has blessed me to come back multiple times... on different occasions, and still, you've given me a chance, still trying to help me out with my... with my life and myself. They're still trying to work with me 'cause I guess they see something in me that I don't see in myself that I'm finally trying to figure out. All right, Timothy Williams. - We shall meet again. - Aye, aye, ma'am. Bye. I keep trying to tell you this here over and over again. Stop taking everybody for granted, son. They are there to help you. - You have three minutes left. - Aye, sir. - How much time you have left? - Three. Three minutes? Okay. Hey, Ma. Ma. Here your grandma. You can say hi to her. - Here you go. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, baby. - How you doing? - All right. And yourself? - I'm doing... you know I'm blessed, baby. I'm just waiting on you. I know, I know. I made a mistake. I messed up. But, you know, I'm trying to correct it right now, so. Okay. Do that, now, 'cause you know I'm waiting. - Five, four, three... - See you later. - All right. I'ma write you. - ...two... - Okay, bye. - ...and hang up right now. Later. It's gonna be all right, Lord. I'm gonna make it for myself. I'm gonna make it for myself. By the blessings and grace of God. He's gonna bless me to walk out these gates to my family that misses me and loves me. I'm gonna make it for myself and my family, by the grace of God. I don't have that many chances and I don't have that much time. We have cameras here everywhere. You can see everything, yet they still break the rules. And for that, there are consequences. I didn't freaking say stop. I didn't say bend over and die. You better give me my... you better give me my trash. You stole it. - Now you gotta pay for it! - Aye, aye, sir. - You understand me? - Sir, yes, sir. - Good! Mule. - Aye, sir. One, sir, two, sir, three, sir, four, sir, five, sir, six, sir, seven, sir, eight, sir, nine, sir, zero, sir. One, sir, two, sir, three, sir, - four, sir, five, sir... - Hey, what'd you do, dummy? Aye, sir. So, this cadet stole a... a cold tray out of the... the chow cart, sir. - Really? - Sir, yes, sir. I hid it under my bunk so I could eat it later on at night, sir. This cadet was hungry, sir. - Well, now you're gonna pay for it. - Aye, sir. You have two seconds to get in that sandpit, and I better see some sand on your grape. If I don't, I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna put my foot up your ass. - Go. - Aye, sir. You got 15, 14, 13... Mr. Dukes swiped two breads and a cookie so, uh, I'm giving him some special attention. Put your grape in that sandpit. Sir, this cadet got sand in his eye, sir. Oh, well. You shouldn't have stolen my cookie. Put your... put your damn head in the freaking sandpit. You stole it. Now you gotta pay for it! - I hate this. - Nine. Will you stop crying?! I'm not crying, sir. Well, I don't know what the hell you're doing, but you're not freaking moving. - This cadet got sand in his eyes. - Oh, well. Hey, stand up. Stand up, sweetheart. Stand up. Stand up. - You hurt? - Sir, no, sir. - Really? Really? - No, sir. - Well, you shouldn't have done what you did, freak. - Aye, sir. Lean forward. There you go. Now clear that crap off your grape. You all right now? Good. Come on, let's go. - Mule kick. - Aye, sir. - You gotta be out of your mind. - Aye, sir. Hey, where's your cookies at? Aye, sir. - Hey, want a cookie? - Sir, no, sir. - You sure? - Sir, yes, sir. - There you go. - I don't want that trash, sir. - Hold that, hold that. - Sir, no, sir. - Hold it. - Sir, no, sir. - You sure? - Sir, yes, sir. I think he's all right now. - Hey, come here, numb nuts. - Aye, sir. - Get in that freaking head and clean that crap off. - Aye, sir! I'm on my way to James Dukes' family home. His brother is the one that I'll be seeing... Gilbert. We've talked over the phone, and he said his mom would be here also. His brother brought it to my attention that a house here on my left is the house that James broke into, which caused him to be arrested. - How you doing, Mr. Gilbert? - Nice to meet you, finally. - Hey, same here, yes. - Yes. - What type of dog is this? - Uh, it's a mixed dog. Oh, my son had one just like that. Yeah? I love my dog. Don't come out the gate, Lucky. - Hello? - Mom. - Yeah? - Here goes Mr. Johnson, James's counselor. This is the picture when he got arrested. He looks terrible. As you can see, the new and improved James. Yeah, that's good. Oh, man, he's standing up straight like he's in the service. Oh, well, he's... yes. - He looks a little rough. - Over here, he look rough and raggedy with James over here. In the camera, he have his hair cut low, shirt in his pants. Yeah. Has he ever had a job? - He ever work for a... - No. - ...where he got paid a salary? - No. - Never had a job. - Never worked, yeah. - Did he finish high school? - No. - What grade? - He need to do his high school. - What grade did he...? - Uh... I believe eighth grade. He never finishes 'cause he always get into trouble. He's always saying he gonna change, and he doesn't. And it really hurt when... to see that he's always getting into trouble because I didn't raise him like that. And I hope he do good and make me proud. Get under the damn covers and face the freaking bulkhead. Aye, sir! Best time of the night... when you get to dream. This shit crazy, man. You can't smile, you can't... nothing, you can't touch yourself, you can't move at all. Crazy. Hey, Cadet Dukes, get over here. Aye, sir. Yay, Cadet. Yay, Cadet. Sir, Cadet Dukes reporting for orders, sir. - Hey, come in here, weirdo. - Aye, sir. Oh, here it go. It must be this. - Heller? - Hello? - Mom? - Hey, bugs! What's up? Nothing. - What's up, boy? - What's going on, bro? Are you talking to your mother? Hold on. Sir, Cadet Dukes requesting permission to speak, sir. - Yeah, speak. - Aye, sir. Sir, my brother's next to my mother, sir. They're on speaker phone, sir. Well, you know, you better stop with that "bro" crap and all that garbage, you understand me? - Sir, yes, sir. - Good. Aye, sir. - Hello? - Yeah. Oh. - I'm doing good. - I know they're trying to break you. Don't let them break you. Show them you can do it. - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. - What? Oh, no, I was saying, "Yes, ma'am." Oh, you... oh! Oh, shoot, you're scaring me. I didn't even know what you were saying. I'm not used to that shit. I know. I can't... I can't get it out my system. Everywhere I go, that's what I say, "Ma'am, yes, ma'am. No, ma'am." Well, hey, that's good. - So, what's good, bro? - See, they're teaching you something over there. And I'm glad you're in the boot camp. In a way, I'm glad I'm here, too, 'cause I'm, like... I'm really learning, like, at the same time. All the bad stuff is coming up out of me and I'm starting to, like, change my life and change my ways and... - 45 seconds. - Aye. Man, what's up, man? I'm proud of you, man. You hold your head up, man. So, what's up, man? What you going through in there, though, man? - Like, what's going on? What you gotta do... - I can't even... I can't even talk, bro, 'cause I got 45 seconds, Eugene. - Dang, are you serious? - 30 seconds. - 30 seconds. - When am I gonna talk to you again? I don't even know, Eugene. I gotta go, though. Um... Tell Mom I said I love her, all right? Yeah, I love you, too. I'm here. - 10, nine... - All right, I love you, Mom. - Love you. - Love you, too, bro. - All right, bye. - ...six, five... - All right, take care. - ...four. I think he was about to cry this day, Ma. No, he was not gonna cry. Yeah, he was. It sounded like it. I know my little brother. I've seen this a million times. And there ain't nothing wrong with it. You let her down, but now you're not gonna do that anymore. You're gonna... gonna do your best. You're gonna be a good son. You're gonna make her proud. Aye, sir. - Do you understand? - Sir, yes, sir. - I'm gonna let you make a head call real quick. - Aye, sir. - Get your thoughts together. - Aye, sir. - Now get out of my face. - Aye, sir. Goodbye to you, sir. - Hey, get out of here. - Aye, sir. May I now say good afternoon, sir? One, two, three, four, five, six, turn. One, two, three, four, five, six, file. Everybody half step, column in a line. Those guys, especially Dukes... he's been giving it all since day one. And look at him now. He's doing good. No complaints. He's a good kid. You know, I'm glad that he came through the program and he had this second chance. Tomorrow, hopefully, if everything goes well, we select work crew, details that will work on day shifts, 7:00 to 3:00. They go out to work for the community. Today, we're going out on work crew. We're gonna go out there and beautify our community... pick up litter, debris. As to who's coming out, when I call your name, step forward. - Cadet Stokes. - Sir, yes, sir! - Cadet Plemons. - Sir, yes, sir! - Davell! - Sir, yes, sir! - Cadet Dukes. - Sir, yes, sir! - Cadet Guzman. - Sir, yes, sir! To my truck. Let's go! Don't get too close to the curb. My main goal right there is to go home. Every time I come out here, it's motivation. Even though there's temptation, but it's motivation to get up outta here. It feel good to see the cars and the houses and to be free and get out of boot camp for a little bit. You can see these guys, they're not in chains. It's really a test of their discipline. And we've really never had anybody that stupid to walk away from the program. You feel like you're so close to the outside life, you're basically just free right here. So close to just home. - Down, up. - Aye, sir! - Down, up. - Yes, sir! - Get on line. - Aye, sir! Five, four, three, two, and one. - Yes, sir! - Damn, outstanding! - Aye, sir! - You got anything for 'em? - Carry on. - Aye, sir. Sirs, good afternoon, sirs! Now to a developing story in southwest Miami-Dade, the search is on right now for two inmates that escaped around lunchtime today. Dozens of Miami-Dade police officers searched on the ground, in the air, looking for the two inmates... James Dukes, arrested for burglary and grand theft, and Manuel Guzman, arrested for robbery and carjacking. Officers say he and Dukes were out doing work detail, which is trash pickup or landscaping labor. According to police, they simply walked away. And new tonight, Miami-Dade police have now captured both escaped prisoners. About 4:15 this afternoon, police took inmate James Dukes into custody, finding him inside an apartment in southwest Miami-Dade. 20-year-old Manuel Guzman is back in police custody, those hours on the run coming to an end. A couple of your cadets, the ones that we've been giving the most chances to, decided to freakin' take off. Just, "Let me just take off. The hell with it. Everything that I've worked for to this point, it's gone." Right? I guess I'm talking to my butt, right? Aye, sir! If they close this program... you're screwed. 'Cause there's no other form of rehabilitation around for you. Any opportunity you had to freakin' change your life and to do something better and to go to school is gone. And then what are you gonna do? You're gonna go to prison. Then you're gonna have to deal with a whole bunch of other stuff 'cause you're gonna be in general population, 'cause you're all adults. You're gonna have to deal with things that are very unpleasant. So, is that what you want? You want them to stop the program at this time, and that's it, we're done? Sir, no, sir. Sir, can a young cadet have permission to speak, sir? - Yeah. - Aye, sir. So, this cadet feel like... this cadet lost two brothers, sir, out of this platoon. But at the same time, sir, those cadets, they knew better, sir. They got a mind of their own. - Okay. - They decided, you know... made that mistake, sir, they gotta pay for that mistake, sir. - Get in my rack. - Aye, sir. Sir, good evening, sir. Damn, he's gonna do... Jules, you think he's gonna do time? What you think? 10... 10 the lowest, right? 10 the lowest. That's what they gonna throw at them. Violation of probation, manda... mandatory escape charge, plus his original charges, which they're probably gonna give him the max, dawg. Okay, shh, shh, shh. All right, that's it, that's it. I'm through being nice to you guys. - Be quiet, all right? - Aye, sir. - Good night. - Good night, sir. - Good night, lady. - Good night, sir. I'm just gonna go over a couple of things. Just, you know, right now, it doesn't look good for the department, it doesn't look good for us. Um, if the cadets have questions, try to answer them as best you can without divulging information and just stay positive, 'cause we will rebound and we will continue to move forward. Okay? Anybody have questions? Fouquet? Private Cork? It's unfortunate, but everything is about choices. And those individuals, they old enough, they got common sense, they know right from wrong. It just came down to making a decision, and it turned out to be a bad decision. As far as Guzman go, - it was a shock. - He was a squad leader? - That's a squad leader. - Yeah, he was a squad leader. So he is... and obviously, Dukes had made some kind of progress. He was showing progress. I... I honestly... I am shocked and I'm surprised. It's our job to continue to move ahead and move on, and to continue to keep the other 33, you know, going in a positive direction. So, first of all, I wanna know what the hell's going on in your heads. What do you think was gonna happen? You think we were gonna give you a slap on the wrist? - Not at all. - They had helicopters in the air. They had freakin' units all over the place looking for you. They had SWAT teams out there. Think about that. And in the news, they had you looking like you were a serial killer or something. So, what do you think the future holds for you now? Wait and see. How bout you Dukes? What do you think the future holds for you now? A whole lot of dismay and destruction. - Say again. - Dismay and destruction. Prison. Do you have anything to tell me before I split? I wanna say I'm sorry. I know you disappointed in me, me and Guzman, and we could have been somewhere better than where we is now, sitting in red jumpers. We could have been getting ready to graduate. I wanna say I'm sorry to my mom, my dad... my family. I wish there was more I could do for you, but I can't. All right? Manuel Guzman, you escaped from the boot camp program. You're now facing six years in state prison. Mr. Dukes, please stand. The State of Florida has charged you with escape, a second-degree felony. You will be adjudicated guilty, sentenced to seven years in the state prison, followed by three years of reporting probation. Okay, we'll be in recess. 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19. Everybody, get shoulder-to-shoulder. - Do it now! - Aye, ma'am! Ten-hut! 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and friggin' one. - Done and done. - I said and one. Done and done. The incident with Dukes and Guzman was bad. I tell you all the time, if you look bad, I look bad, so right now, we're looking bad. So, it behooves me to get out of my house and cancel my plans for my Saturday morning to get in here. I don't want this to deter everybody else here. I still want Platoon 15-1 to continue to move forward. - Everybody understand that? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. What's y'all motto? Somebody give it to me real slow. Red, green, blue, gold, the strong survive, the weak will fold. Blood, sweat, tears, and all, success is a must, we refuse to fall. Boot camp. Anybody can remember... memorize a song, a rap or whatever, but when you put it in here, and when you put it in here, that's when you get something out of it. This program is about making you stronger mentally and physically before you enter the society. I see great things from a lot of y'all. I see improvement. I wanna see you 10 years from now as a man, not the little boy that you are now. Are you dedicated?! Dedicated, drill instructor, dedicated! This is your life, and it'll be your time to face it. We have no choice but to stay and do it, you know? ...five, six, seven, eight, nine... Drink that water. Hydrate yourself. Everything we do is for a reason, but we got to remember the big picture. For once in our life, we get to do something positive. When you get out of here, you're gonna go out there, you're gonna start something new, you're gonna start something that's good for your future. March! Hold! These are my brothers. I live with them, shit with them, sleep with them, eat with them. I'm my brothers' keepers right now. It feels as if this is your first time doing the best thing in your life. Boot camp! Boot camp! Boot "cam." Hey, hey, lock and load! Hey, hey, lock and load! Sound of the ground is so hard and cold. Sound of the ground is so hard and cold. We were always ready to go! We were always ready to go! So early, so early, so early in the morning. So early, so early, so early in the morning. Platoon, halt. Lopez gets that crazy look on his face. I mean, I guess some people just get scared, but I just... I get amped with it.

Sir, can this cadet have permission to speak, sir? - Yeah. - This cadet done tried it by himself, sir. - You did it? - Sir, yes, sir. Not bad. Not bad at all. - Aye, aye, sir. - Good job. Aye, aye, sir. - I wanna see 'em both when you're done. - Aye, aye, sir. Get ready. Go. How bad you want it? Come on. Five, four, three, two, one. Stop! Jules.

I would like to thank you for attending Platoon 15-1's graduation. We all know them as Castillo, we know them as Tough, Guillaume, Plemons, but they're more than that. To you guys, they're your sons, they're your brothers, they're your uncles, and we definitely want to get them back to you as soon as possible and as whole as possible. Thank you. How's it feel, cadets? - Good, sir. - Feels good, right? - Sir, yes, sir. - Yeah. It's a good day. Congratulations. We're all very, very proud of you. I just need to point something out. Plemons, let me see your glasses. Look at Plemons' glasses. These glasses broke, and they've got 93 pounds of tape on them. And he's like, "I know, sir. When I get out, I'm gonna buy a new pair, throw them away." I said, "No, actually, you need to keep these 'cause these are the example... these are the example of when things go wrong, you don't throw them away, you don't make excuses. You tape 'em up and you move on." You hold on to these. - Giraldez, this is your family, right? - Sir, yes, sir. - Sir, yes, sir. - Okay. - That's your mom? - Sir, yes, sir. Mrs. Giraldez, how do you feel about being here? There's one more family I want to point out. Williams and his grandma. Could you tell us how you feel and how it feels to be here? I know when he came in, you had a big smile on your face. You were just saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you." Thank you all so very much, because he was beyond help. They wanted to give him 30 years, and I couldn't... I almost lost my mind. I am so proud of him. He has come a long ways. Now, I would like, actually, to thank, just, um, Commanding Officer Lieutenant Green, all the judges, especially my judge, 'cause they gave me more than one opportunity to become who I am trying to be today. - Who is your judge? - Judge Rodney Smith. - He's not here right now. - Hello! Oh, snap. Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Judge. Congratulations. I'm very proud of y'all. And get out there and do good. Free men! Hi! Thank you. Ah! Yeah, dude. I'm going home, man. I ain't never coming back to this boot camp! Never! Now I got my baby back. You're my baby. It'll be a steady full-time job if you make it that. I'm gonna hire you. The only thing I ask you to do is please don't go out there and let me down. - That's all I ask. - I won't, sir. - Thank you, son. - Thank you. What you doing? On that table, I think.
