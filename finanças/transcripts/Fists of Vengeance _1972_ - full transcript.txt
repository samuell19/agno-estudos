Xu Qian, long time no see, how are you? Fine Thanks for taking care of the home You're too kind It's my duty when you are not at home I should thank you even more Brother Jian Guang, is Zi Fei back?

He is quite good Yes What are you laughing at? Brother Zi Fei... Are you okay? Take me in quickly Don't worry I didn't use much force, he'll come around in 5 minutes What are you laughing at? A man only has one life If Zi Fei had not restrained himself, you'd already have been killed What? You have a good son Put me down Are you alright? The elderly love to excel I just want to make him happy You scared me What would happen if you really broke your arm? See how fast my heart is beating Master Guan... Mister Ogawa Please sit Yes I hear Old Yan's son is back Yes He also knows some kung fu would he be in our way? I think... Doesn't matter I am prepared to fight These are the samurai I have hired from Japan they should be adequate to deal with him Of course I think it should not use force for now As I have some hold on the Yan family But before the business is completed, I'd like to know my share of profit You are smart I guarantee you'll make profit Good, thanks... Then I'll go to the Yan's tomorrow No, I'm not selling You could name any price it doesn't matter Price is not the issue, I'm not selling especially not to Japanese Stop Mr. Yan, it seems you are against imperial Japan Say what you will I am Chinese This... We needed the wood in the forest Even you would not sell We'll get it by all means What do you think? What do you mean? Nothing, just a gesture of goodwill I'll answer you directly I will not sell my forest to the Japanese And... Brother Yan Xu Qian, see our guest out Yes Please Remember one thing: If anything happens to the forest title deeds you could find one thing in these three statues and then you can settle it Yes, dad Damn Ishikawa Go right away and finish off the Yans Yes Wait... Mister Ogawa Even if you wipe them all out you can't get the whole forest Besides, the mayor would not let you do it What's your plan then? Let's prepare some gold bars and invite the mayor to come here Please Please Please Please sit It's just a small token from Mr. Ogawa and me Regarding the matter of the land of the forest... But this matter... is not as easy as you think Are you saying you can't do anything? No...there is and I've got a plan for you Listen, get old Yan's seal and deed Then make a deed of sale and I'll officially register it for you at the registry Then the ownership will be yours It won't work The deed and seal are in the Yan household I can take care of that There's a member of his household we could use I really can't believe dad would change like this Let's drop it We've left only for a few years and there are so many changes Yue Hua, have you spoken to dad about our marriage? Not yet, and you? There's so much happening at home how could I raise it? Guess we returned at a bad time It's not too late to mention it when the matter is settled I fear the Japanese would become worse then my dad and your dad... Don't worry, I don't think they'd dare to do much That's up to your dad and has nothing much to do with us Didn't I say to you on the train we'll never be apart Brother Zi Fei... Jiao Jiao, you are here I have been looking for you So you've been coming here with Miss Guan What do you want with me? Nothing You are not discussing secrets with Miss Guan, are you?

He's gone Come, men Master, brother Zi Fei... Here Search Where's Xu Qian? He was saved by the Japanese samurai How could we avenge dad's death and loss of the deed? Relax, let's take the matter up to the township office Mister Ogawa, Yan Zi Fei is suing you for the murder of his father, stealing the deed and the seal, this... Yan Zi Fei is bearing false witness against me, his accusations are false When his father was alive, he already sold the land to me. And now he wants to renege on his father's decision Sir, please don't let him cover up the truth Zi Fei Quiet... Mister Ogawa, since you say his father already sold the land to you, could you produce any proof? Of course This is the sale agreement Yan Zi Fei, there's proof now what have you got to say? Sir, I said already the deed was stolen thus the agreement is fraudulent What? Ask Mister Guan and Xu Qian to come in Stop... Yan Zi Fei, how dare you fight in this place of law He is my father's murderer I ask you, was Xu Qian your family accountant? Yes So he handled the money? Yes Speak, Xu Qian That's right, the late Master Yan did sell the forest to Mister Ogawa and I personally took the money What? You... Stop... He wants to annul the agreement, and accuse me of murder and stealing the deed I am innocent Stop Don't move Stop... or I'll have you arrested Xu Qian, you... Yan Zi Fei, what have you got to say now? Uncle Guan, you best know the affairs of my family; when did my father sell the land? Zi Fei, you might not know your father in fact sold the land to Mr. Ogawa I was there and saw it with my own eyes Uncle, you... Guan Fu Lin Zhong, stay out of it Uncle, for the sake of Yue Hua, how could you.... You're unreasonable in this matter in all respects but, for the sake of your late father I will let you go for causing trouble here But the ownership of that piece of land goes to Mister Ogawa Dad Wait, all of you from the Guan family are not worthy to pay respects to my father I know you all hate me But for the sake of my relationship with Zi Fei I should at least burn incense for uncle Zi Fei, is Guan Fu Lin's daughter worthy to offer her respects? Zi Fei, what do you think? Go away Zi Fei No more Relationship between our families has long since ended but l... You belong to the Guan family please don't ever come to our home again But, what of all that we said on the train, and our future plans? Why are you your father's daughter? Why did they have to kill my father? For revenge I might kill your father one day When that time comes how could I burn incense at your father's altar? I believe I should go Mister Ogawa, it's just about right All that remains is for the mayor to go to the registry I believe my money should be ready? Things are not as simple as you think The mayor takes all decisions here If the case goes to the provincial government, we'll... The only way is to rid our problem completely Ishikawa Yes Before you massacre the Yan family, storm Old Zhong's martial arts school first You want to watch your students die, or do it yourself? I'll deal with the master Big trouble... The Japanese have stormed our martial arts school What are you doing here? We're here to get rid of you all Jiao Jiao... Jiao Jiao... Jiao Jiao... Jiao Jiao... Master...go quickly... I am not leaving Is this the right seal? Of course I killed my foster father to get it You are a cruel person you'll do the same to us one day What is the meaning of this? You... Jiao Jiao, wake up Jiao Jiao, wake up Hurry Get out of here, quick Jiao Jiao You want to escape? Jiao Jiao... Master...your wounds are not healed, don't get up Where's Jiao Jiao? I hear the Japanese have taken her Where are you going? To get her back Master... It was difficult finding this place to hide you and let you recuperate If you go now won't that just be sacrificing yourself? Master, all relies on you to avenge this feud You should recover fully and then gradually think of a plan Mister Guan Mister Ogawa, big trouble What is it? The mayor just notified me The seal is different from the version held at the provincial government Please come at once Go... Where? I don't know I really don't know Oh, the girl Go in and have a drink I can't drink anymore Want to get some rice for the Chinese girl? Forget it, she's not eating Jiao Jiao Miss Jiao Jiao Miss... Jiao Jiao, I am Yue Hua I've come to get you out Miss You really have forgotten me? I am Yue Hua I really can't drink any more Jiao Jiao... Jiao Jiao... Miss Jiao Jiao Strange, where has she gone? Let's go quickly So you're here Why didn't I see you just now? Come, a kiss Strange, two? Another one? Let me kiss you Wake up... hurry... Iet's go... I little thought the old Yan stored his seal elsewhere; If we can't find it there'll be big trouble The matter was going smoothly But there's one remedy I'll stall the matter while you get Yan Zi Fei As long as we could find him we'll have the real seal Right Get the seal at all costs Big trouble... Someone killed Mister Nomura and saved that Chinese girl Get me Yan Zi Fei right away Have you got the wrong place? No, it's the house just up the road Hurry Jiao Jiao... Jiao Jiao... She's back What's with her? She's been raped by the Japanese Zi Fei... If you hurt your health who'll seek revenge? Yue Hua, I am so useless... Damn, so many men and yet no one even know who killed Nomura and saved Jiao Jiao You are all useless Mister Ogawa, I think we could deal with the girl and Yan Zi Fei later Let's deal with old Guan today He wants to invest all his assets and has asked me to go to his place for a drink Alright, he has a good appetite; he thinks more the investment, more the profit We still need him Let's get his money tonight first Mister Ogawa, here's the cash please check You are sincere You're welcome, it's our mutual interest It's only right to offer some money Right, about the deed for Yan family's land I believe the mayor should have no problem Could he refuse us? Of course, please take the money Don't touch the money What do you mean by this? Dad, don't fall for their trap don't forget how Xu Qian died They can't take this money Miss, don't make trouble This is our money, it's none of your business So stubborn Mister Guan, this deal is a big issue among us Yes For our close cooperation Yue Hua should marry lshikawa What? You object? No, l... That means you consent I object What? She is my daughter she'll not marry a Japanese You beast Never mind, she's mine anyway we could have fun tonight Mom, are you alright? Let me handle it here Go to the Green Farm right now Ask brother Yan to come and save me Doggie knows the way Go quickly please Master, how's your hand? Much better, the medicine? It's here. But, master, even after so many doses miss is still in a daze I don't know when she'll come around Don't you have something to do? I'll administer to her the medicine I'll make a move then Go on Jiao Jiao, time for medicine what's the matter with you? Come on Don't come near...

Iet me out Big trouble The Japanese are causing trouble in our home and molesting Yue Hua Jiao Jiao... Mister Ogawa, please Excuse our humble service Iadies, take good care of him Ogawa Mister Yan, we've been waiting for you here Good, we have a score to settle You are so confident? Zi Fei What are you waiting for? kill him You still trust the Japanese? Hurry Careful, he has a gun Don't kill him, just catch him Ask him to hand out the real seal I was teaching you a lesson, now I'll kill you Zi Fei Mister Yan, if you don't want to die hand over the seal I'll get the forest by whatever means The Mayor could take the seal in hand as the real one That is a fake I said that only to get your money Are you handing it over or not? Over my dead body If you think you could get my land by this means you're too naive Wait and see Then we'll deal with Yue Hua She's mine, nobody can touch her You can't I'll hand over the seal Give it to me It's here You hid the seal in the statue to protect your inheritance What a good idea! Thank you Mister Guan, your turn now I want you dead What? All your assets are in my hands I have no use of you anymore so I want you dead Mister Ogawa, you are too cruel Problems must be gotten rid off forever Yes Ogawa You are a beast Your turn now kill them all I'll keep Yue Hua for my pleasure Zi Fei... Where's the rope? Here Tie him up Are you okay? Let's get out of here quickly Go... What are you thinking? I was thinking why don't we report this feud with the Japanese all the way to the provincial government The mayor sides with them; everywhere we go to seek help is useless As soon as we go out they'd grab us In this way we're trapped for life here No, I was thinking what I could do against lshikawa Got it If I could practise such that my flying daggers could hit the falling leaves maybe there's hope to go against his pistol Zi Fei Master... I just heard Ogawa's company will open tomorrow Yes Their death has come "Ogawa Forest Company" A toast to our good friend Mayor Ma We'll need your help in the future Cheers... Yan Zi Fei, have you come to celebrate with us or come to die? I've come to kill you Look Doggie...are you alright?
