She's nearly 16. Others her age are big girls by now. Can anything be done? I'd like to ask you some questions. No need. Could you please lift your arm? Any serious illness as a child? Was your mother sickly? Not was. She's alive. Just couldn't come home yet. Hormones are the least of the problem. She's only just begun puberty. Come back in 6 months. It hasn't just begun. She's been like this for 2 years. ISRAELITE COMMUNITY ORPHANAGE -Hello! -Hi. This way. Boys! Let me help. Hold on tight, it's heavy. 1948. September 17. Donor: Aladár Körner. "BUILDING SOCIALISM" -It's you? -Yes. -Something wrong? -No. -Did you come to see me? -Well, yes… I just want to say something. When you come out. -I'm almost done. -I know. Aren't women afraid of the gynecologist? -They don't say. -I don't say either. -What did you want to say? -Well… That I got my period. -Already? That's great. -At least you're happy. And my aunt. I think it's shit. Disgusting. And the cramps are the worst. Awful. Apply heat to it. My mother always winds a big scarf around her hips, too. Don't you discuss this with your classmates? They're stupid! School is shit! Often I don't even go, but my aunt doesn't know. All she knows is worrying: "Eat right, dress warm." Your coat looks really dumb. Where'd you get it? You were much sweeter before your period. You hurried it. -Where do you live? -Where do you live? I'll walk you home, then go home too. -Do you live alone here? -Yes. -Then why do you want to send me home? -It's better alone. -Are you lying now? -Always. -Even now? -Even now. If you are lying that you always lie, then you don't always lie. But if it's true that you always lie, you aren't lying at all, still you don't always lie. How are your grades in math? I'm about to fail. -That must take a lot of effort. -Working to fail my other subjects too. Listen. Shouldn't you be home by now? Your aunt surely hasn't a moment's peace. I know. Her life would be easier if I'd be gone too. I'll make tea. I hate tea. Is there anything you don't hate? No. But your belly's got to be full. While you're alive. Why do you live? Is there any real answer to that? It's harder for us, you know. Harder than…? Than for those who left. I was simply left behind. You too? I don't know. If you don't like the taste of tea, you can add sugar and lemon substitute. Olgi doesn't let me. All sugar rations must be set aside for her cake. Her crazy idea is: cake will fatten me more than tea. Though clearly I'm already fat. I weigh 40 kg. Such a stupid woman. Why is she stupid? You think she's ever read a serious book? She doesn't understand anything. Can't understand her whole family gone too. You know what she talks about? Where to get potatoes, when they get meat, and if we'll have enough eggs for the cake. You should be ashamed of yourself. Do you like it with lemon substitute? I don't know. -Is lemon substitute made from lemons? -No. I thought so. Look. Olgi would be happy. Her mashed potatoes would be better if she'd put butter in it. But she doesn't. -I've given up eating anyway. -Stop it already. -What do you do at home alone? -I read. Medical journals. As much as my German allows. Do you read the Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift? My dad had a subscription. He always jokes they named it after him, because our name is Wiener too. -Your father was a doctor too? -Not was. He's alive, but as a war prisoner. Many are still imprisoned, right? -True. -Right? Yes. I live here. Well, goodnight then. And tell Olgi next time you stay out late. You know… Yes? Can it… be like in the kitchen again? Would you hug me? -May I ask something too? -What? That you eat lunch. Or just eat in general. In exchange for one hug? We can discuss that later. Go on now. I'll wait till you get upstairs. How do you know we live upstairs? You looked up to see if the light is on. "Dear Mama! Sweet Papa! Today I went back to that gynecologist that Olgi dragged me to. Just to tell him I got it. I thought he'd be happy. He couldn't care less. He seemed like someone incapable of feeling joy at all. I felt a little sorry for him. The radio announced that there are still POWs in Swedish and Dutch hospitals. The Doctor confirmed this. Papa, I borrowed your Wochenschrifts, but I'll take good care of them." Stop! Don't touch! Go away! "I can't wait to see you again! I miss you. With love, Klára." I translated the Tables of Contents. Tell which article interests you, and I'll translate. Already did one, but I'm not sure if it's good. Often I couldn't even find out the meaning. But I put question marks there, so you won't think I'm a dummy. No, I don't think that. -How do you know… -My grandparents and I spoke German, but Mama taught me translation, and Papa was so proud when I translated Max und Moritz into French for my little sister. -Your sister? -Yes, but that translation's lost. And my sister died. I saw her die. Two coffees please. -Chicory or black? -Chicory. No chicory. Then I don't want anything. -But black is very strong. -It's okay. I don't want anything fake. Not even fake lemon. Two black coffees then. Do you have pastry? -Mignons? -We have mignons. Several flavors. They're in the display case, Ma'am. "Ma'am." He thinks I'm an old lady. Bring two. -But I don't know what kind you like. -Two for you. I chose chocolate and punch. For you, a chocolate one. -That's 3,30 altogether. -That's alright. -So how old are you? -Me? Forty-two. Didn't you ever want kids? Careful with the leather folder. -Enjoy. -Thank you. Your composition is very good. I read a lot. Mostly during class. And afternoons in the cinema's lobby. -And what do you read? -Everything, but Thomas Mann is the best. Sometimes the translations are lame. So I read it in the original. Do you know Thomas Mann? Can I stay here? I'm not going back to Olgi. She saw when I came home. And saw you hug me. Said she's had enough. She thought I was just a poor little kid, but she's not raising a whore. Do you have a phone? -What's the number? -426-630, but I'm not going home. You don't have to, but we have to reassure Olgi too. Don't call her! She'll just tell me to go home. If you kick me out, I'll go to the train station and sleep there. Then I can be a real whore. All those guys there. A bunch of men. You're soaked. Don't you want a bath? I just put the pot on. A bath? But didn't you want to use that water? I'll put another pot on. We don't bathe. Olgi saves money. Before, we used to bathe every night. We had a boiler. So did we. Why are you a whore, if you're scared alone? That was me. Sure, it can be misread, Olgi, but she's safe with me. Even if I did lack sobriety or decency… I'm no longer in that category. If you understand my meaning. But my decency is still in working order. Well, I don't know about the neighbors… I see. I went to the marketplace with half-a-coin. Bought myself a rooster with half-a-coin. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Are you religious? Not anymore. -But do you believe in God? -I don't know. Are you angry with Him? I put a white toothbrush in the cup for you. It's new. I don't believe in Him. So I can't be mad. We have to get up early. To fetch your schoolbag at home. If you don't want me to stay, I can go. Goodnight. -Are you mad now? -No, I'm just tired. -And if you weren't lying? -Goodnight. Just because you're scared alone, that doesn't make you a whore. I'm scared too. I can't give anything else. I'm a much simpler person. This isn't what she needs, I know. I can't help in her studies, either. Her father, my poor nephew, profited from his knowledge. I was searching for my sister's grandchildren in the orphanage when I found Klára, so I brought her home. If you could take her on, she'd surely be better off. I wouldn't, but she would. Klára is not happy with me. If she would lose you, Olgi… it would be horrible. I'm not sure I'd be a very cheerful father to her. But perhaps better than nothing. "Dear Mama, Sweet Papa! From now everything is different. Aldo comes Tuesday afternoons and I go to his place. Next day he walks me to the tram station. We leave together Friday mornings: me to school, he to the orphanage. Sundays, the three of us go out together because it's Olgi day. -And that girl? -I don't know. -Aldo, who's that girl? -Which one? -There. Thank you. -What are you doing now? -Replacing… -Why did you move there? -It's the rule. -Then the rule is that I'll take this out, put this in, and this too… so what do you say to that! Guess what, Papa, Aldo smells just like you. Or may be it's the pajamas? I'll have to find out. Aldo! What is it? Wake me up next time if you leave. Alright. Listen. You could come for me to the orphanage tomorrow. Play with the little kids. They're bored. Or you know what? You could teach them German. Numbers, days of the week. -To sing O Tannenbaum. -No! I won't go there! Not to the orphanage! I'm not… I'm not an orphan! -I'm not! No. No. -You're not. You're not. I know you're not. I know. It's okay. CLASS SCHEDULE I'm definitely failing Wiener. If I didn't fail her, I couldn't fail anyone else. If she doesn't answer questions for weeks, she shouldn't be in high school. She's a clever girl, but very difficult. The trauma. Of course, the trauma. She's smart, but eccentric. She calls poets stupid and writes mocking poems on her test papers. She should curb herself a bit. We've had enough problems in this country. Mustn't always stand out. She likes history up to the 1900s, but falls silent at the war. I have no problems with Klára, but you should know that there are those who'd do anything to have her out of here. She irritates them. Next year, Russian will be introduced, and the teacher wants everyone to be equal. Understand? A communist movement poem on the radio. I love this actor. What's his name again? Klára? Yes, hello? Good evening, Olgi. How high? 39.5°C. What hurts? Have you called the pediatrician, Olgi? -Hello? -Hello, Pista. Let me listen to your lungs. -Take your shirt off. -Then turn away, Aldo. Sunny, you think Aldo hasn't seen a chest before? Okay, but he's not a doctor now. Breathe deep. -Does it hurt? -A bit, back there. -What did you eat today? -She didn't even want lunch. -How much did she drink? -Two or 3 cups of tea. Not enough. She needs a big mug every 2 hours, or dehydration will put her into hospital. Let me examine your belly. -Aldo… -I'm turning away. I heard you'd returned, but I didn't dare call you. You didn't call to say you needed me. Margit and I were alone for a while, but now we have 2 girls. They're 13 and 7. How old is Klára? She can be anything between 5 and 70. It's okay. Cold… -Sweetheart. -Mama. I'm cold… Mama. Alright. -I'm cold… -It'll be okay. -Good day, Doctor. -Good day! -Is the girl doing better? -She's better. Thanks. -Aldo, read a book instead. -Why? The newspaper always puts you in a bad mood. And you should be studying. Fine, then don't wear that ratty cardigan. I'm sure you have one that fits more well. I like it. Four hydrogen chloride and 2 oxygen make up… What? Two water and… And 2 chloride gas. Makes sense, no? First there was a family of 4, hydrogen and chloride, then oxygen came and took the hydrogens away and they turned into water… Only the chlorides were left and now they're in pairs. Aldo. Aldo. I'm coming. Aldo, is it because of the chloride? I'm coming. Just a moment. We are the chlorides? Sunny dear, the dentist only had an afternoon appointment, but it's better like this. I've owed you something for a while. Perhaps I can pay off my debt now. I thought you could look through the old albums. They're in the middle drawer. There's no secret in them, but I can't look at them. I only ask that you don't ask or say anything about them. I'm not as strong as you. I'll ring the buzzer when I arrive. Please put the albums away before you open the door. Where are my glasses? -What are their names? -Panni and Jutka. -Did the Seilmanns have children before? -Three. Don't worry, I'll be nice. Yes, please. Was the lemon enough? Take some cake. The girls baked it. Judit, dear, pour for yourself too. Your dress is so pretty. I always wanted one like that. She got it yesterday. Oh, I know! She wants to show you her doll. You go too, Panni. That was easier than I thought. Sunny can burn you if the mood strikes her. Life's easier with Panni since Pista realized that she needs her childhood back. She was forced to grow up at age 9. Judit is our little cluster of love. Unfortunately she doesn't speak yet. …I don't know the words and my piano teacher will cane me… Would you be sad if I died? No. I'd slap you. I'm going to live beside you in heaven anyway. You think that's where we'll go? Why do you care? You don't even believe in it. Wiener! You should be at home, studying. Ma'am, this is Aladár Körner. -Aldo, this is… -Mrs. Vidák. The Comrade and I have met. Yes. Your mouth is huge. Now you look like Mrs. Vidák. Let me see. Except it smears easily while kissing. Wiener! I've been looking for you! The principal wants to see you. Come on in, Klára. Sit down. Where did you go from the park yesterday? -Home. -Meaning? Béke Road 10. Aladár Körner's apartment. But your official guardian is Olga Mezo. -Well, it's the arrangement. -Don't begin sentences with "well." How do you know the doctor? His gynecology office. And well… And we study together. You know I'm failing chemistry. I know perfectly well. But why was your head in Aladár Körner's lap yesterday? I was scared. Klára, are you pregn… What were you talking about? About God. Alright, run along back to your classroom, okay? I'm not a fatso like that stupid Mrs. Somogyi, right? There's nothing wrong with Mrs. Somogyi. Or was she bad today? They found out about the park. -Found out? -They questioned me. -About what? -Who you are to me. What do you mean, who? Questioned you? Who did? Well, Mrs. Vidák. But what exactly did they ask? Why my head was in your lap. I told them we were talking about God. That reassured them. But I'll handle this. Don't you worry about it. -Doctor, there's a lady here for you. -Yes, I know. Thank you, Mr. Bauer. -Hello. -Oh, Ali, dear, so happy to see you. Sweetie, thanks so much for all the things you sent. It's been such a huge help. We haven't had a decent plate since '45. And the dinner set. Gorgeous! Thank you, Ali, dear! You're welcome, Györgyi! -And how are you all? -How do you think? Forcibly relocated and live out nowhere among lowlifes. We commute 2 hours and don't have decent clothes. Not even the girls. Ali, dear, that reminds me, Veronka said you have a lot of old things in your cellar too. And well, Ilona's things are… I don't know. Veronka arranged my cellar. I wouldn't want to touch it. -I'd gladly look around… -Györgyi, dear. -I'll let you know if I clean it up. -It's okay if it's… How old are your daughters? They're big girls. Seventeen and 21. And who are you, by the way? -Would you like tea or coffee? -I won't intrude any longer, thank you. Well, you certainly can't say your place is like the old one, either. But at least you are downtown. You're really lucky. That word hadn't occurred to me before. -Well, child, this can't be saved. -Did I say that? What I need is another one. One exactly like it. And fast, before he complains that it's missing. He got it from his wife. Forgive me. It's alright. Sorry, it's a long time since I was a situation like this. -It's not about you. -You may dress. Let's go over your details, shall we? Erzsébet Fényes. Born in Baja, -1909. -Yes. Are you married? No. -Children? -None. And are you planning any? -Will there be boys? -Aldo, dear, it's a dance school. Be careful what you say to whom though. -What dances will you do? -I've no idea. Group dances, or touchy-feely couples dances? -And here's something else. -That's such a dumb book. Juli's shown me already. I'm not letting anybody stick their "penis" into my "vagina". Alright. I just wanted you to know about the biology, but… And I might add that love is much more than this. Don't worry about boys. They're incredibly dumb. And they don't smell nice. They're so corny. Once this man tried to rub against me on the bus. Next time, I'll kick him in the penis. Sunny, isn't that lipstick a bit much? Oh Aldo, dear! Pick me up at 8, then? Wrote the address down. It's on your desk. One, two, three, and… Feet together, feet together, Slide, two, three, four Feet together, feet together. Slide, two, three, four. Don't wave your hands around. Respect the rhythm so much that you don't step on it. Bow. Thank you, choose partners! Don't be so wimpy, boys. Pick a partner and ask her to dance. That's it. Your jacket, for goodness sake… And full of lint, great. Stand up straight! Move with the circle, with the rhythm! One, two, three, and… -Well, hello there. -I thought I'd drop in on you. Come in. -Sunny? -She's at dance school. Something wrong? You think it's… -Sit down. -I just came for a moment. Aladár, I joined the Party. I thought it over. They told me, my father was a factory owner, so I should lay low. And there's my family. Don't you worry about Sunny? Yes, I do. What exactly does she mean to you? An hour ago, they called me and said I am to report on 3 colleagues. You're one of them. And well… so here I am. One, two, three, one, two, three, weight in front after the turn. Enjoy the music! One-two, one-two, and step with your left foot, gentlemen! Move your feet across! Thank you! Bow! Thank you, Mr. Balogh! Your music was fantastic tonight, though not sure they heard the rhythm. They have dance contests for the handicapped… They can dance like this, and if he finds a woman like him… See ya! Someone's waiting for me. You came early. It's not over… never mind. I was told to come at 8. What do I know? Who's Shorty? You had to dance with him? He was pretty lame. A girl partner would've been better. -And did he ask anything about you? -Who? Pepe? -Pepe? What kind of name is that? -I guess his name is Péter. He just asked which class I'm in and my interests. And he tried to recruit me. I'm kidding, Aldo, don't worry. He's just a boy. We'll dance at home, don't sulk. I can't dance. I dreamt that in the ghetto, a soldier tied Jutika to a tree so she'd starve. And they wouldn't let me untie her. Mama told me in parting to take care of Jutika, because she's still small and scared. -But I couldn't take care of her. -But how could you have? I should have been able to! Do you still dream of them too? Not anymore. To me, they're everywhere. Let's stay like this. For a long time. Aldo, dear. I want to ask you something. Ask. But I'm scared. Though I really want to. Out with it. If I wouldn't be, would you already have a wife? No. It'd be better for you. She'd iron for you. I know how to iron. You said you're glad that I ironed your shirts. It wouldn't be better. Don't worry. But why wouldn't it be better? Everything's just fine like this. Believe me. Do you go to your girfriend's? Nah, the radio's broadcasting a play by Ferenc Molnár. Sunny, you should go out more. Meet people. People your own age. I'll go and make you rolled squiggles! -Oh, that's great! -Really? Really. -Doesn't it hurt? -It doesn't. -If you had a wife… -Sunny, enough of this. Okay, just cause if you don't have a wife and I won't have a husband, then I want to care for you. -Where are you going now? -A party. Party? What party? You told me to meet people. One of my classmates is hosting this party tonight. -But who? -Nobody you know. -And when will you be home? -11. Okay? -Already? The party was no good? -I was bored to death. It's much better at home. Shall we dance? Doctor, you don't know what I just heard. Chief accountant was taken from his flat in the night. No news of him since. Even his wife knows nothing. It's times like these I'm not sorry I don't have kids. Greetings, Erzsébet. This is Dr. Körner. -Do you know this place, Doctor? -No… I mean, yes. I recommend the mignon. Please call me Aladár. So you have a sweet tooth… right? Sure, at a café… Two black coffees and two mignons. -Chocolate. -Chocolate. Tell me about yourself. My fiancé simply disappeared in March of '45. He was a transport engineer. The wedding was set for April. One day, he didn't come home. We searched for him everywhere, for years. -I've been alone ever since. -That's no good. We're not made to be alone. I have a foster daughter since last year. Klára. I would have liked a little Klára too. After my mother. I feel empty without children. What have we done, Jóska? God created you for me. I'm only goods. I'm offered for bills. -Father can't pay any other way. -I'll get it, if I die trying. I'll free you. Did you like it? That Jóska really loved that girl! Everything's so simple in the movies. -I'll walk you home. -No! You don't have to. I live far. All the better. We'll have time to talk then. -I don't want to say anything. -Ok, then I'll talk. The lineup of the Újpest FC. Substitutes too. Or all the Hungarian Olympic Champions. Did you know you can win a swim race with just one leg? Olivér Halassy was European Champion in Paris in 1931. He was killed by the Russians. Shh, you dummy. No, I don't know all these things yet. But I really have to go. Aladár, thank you. I had a very good time. Me too. If it needs salt, go ahead and salt it. It's fine. Very tasty. Just right. Sunny. If I'm taken, get on the first tram and go back to Olgi. No! I won't! Good morning. Time to get ready. Good morning. -I thought-- -This evening-- -Go ahead. -No. You say it. Okay. I met someone. A nice lady. And I invited her over here today. I see. Aldo, dear, that's… wonderful news, Aldo. -And what did you want to say? -Nothing. Doesn't matter anymore. Then I'll sleep at Olgi's tonight. Klára! Why didn't you tell me? I would've cooked something else. Are you hungry? Aldo asked me to sleep here tonight. Did they commend him to someone then? What does that mean? They do that. When a man and a woman have been alone a while, someone commends them. They could even have a baby. That's how I ended up with János. And well, we were till death do us part. He was always decent to me. Never even cheated. Even when he was drinking, he was never fussy about anything. My second cousin commended us in '24. I somehow wasn't skilled enough to get a man. Though I always wanted a family. And so when János asked me to marry him, I said yes, and it wasn't half bad. But Aldo isn't lonely. And when I asked him about this wife thing, he said he doesn't want anybody. He only wants me there. It's okay. It's okay. It'll be better this way, you'll see. If you love Aldo, you must learn to love his mate. He'll still always be your Aldo. I'll make some mashed potatoes, okay? They even had butter at the grocery. Hi there! Come here. -This will wipe away your sour expression. -Goodness! You madman. Where did you get this? Vienna. There's a chocolate shop on Mariahilferstrasse. You're kidding, right? You could get jail time for this. Who'd you get it from? Well, this Austrian lady around 40. Hair in a tight bun. A scarf or something on her head. -Looked like one of my cousins. -Uh-huh. You're lying. -So you're a liar too. -No. Somehow I can't. Not for the world. But… soon I'm leaving. Really. My uncle's a boat captain. Floats down the Danube up the Iron Gates. The sea. And he's finally arranged for me to go with him. But if you tell me not to go, I'll stay. 3 YEARS LATER -Olgi, dear, sit down, I'll do it. -Just this one thing… -Hello, Aldo, dear! -Hi, Sunny! -Is Erzsi here already? -Yes, she arrived on time. Hi there, all! Good day, Olgi, dear! I'm sorry, we had twins in the ward. I had to stay. -Pepe? -You never know. Guess he's doing business, always scheming and trading. Fresh carrots for bike inner tubes. He just brought her two pairs of nylon stockings. And Aldo will take me to Hévíz spa for Easter. Doctor's orders. I'll get it. What a surprise! They didn't tell you I was coming, right? I knew it. Hold the door! With deep regret, we inform the Party and all workers of the Soviet Union, that on March 5th, at 9:50PM, after a long illness, Joseph Stalin passed away. Yes! This can't be true. Good Lord. Maybe it's a provocation. No! Everything will be different! I'll show you Vienna! Take you to America, and if we want, we can simply stay. -Our son to baseball games. -Start business there! -Pepe, told you a thousand times-- -He has to imagine good. That's how he works. Then let's drink to the lady of honor. Come. To your health, Olgi! Happy Birthday, Olgi. -Your health. -To your health. Aldo, don't be angry with Pepe. I'm not angry. -I brought some cake too. -Oh, thank you! You shouldn't have. I know. I'll put it back, okay? Aldo? Is something wrong? No. Are you lying now too? Always. Just I'd like to get in there too. Oh, sorry, I didn't know. Well, so it was like that. And I hurried home. And now let's toast to those who should be here, but are not.
