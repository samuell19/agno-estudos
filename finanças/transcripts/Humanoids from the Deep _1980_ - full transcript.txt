I bet you've never made it with two dummy's. As they say: "Two heads are better than one". Well, Chuck works everytime. What would you do without me? Well, just watch. Hey, come on. What do you think you're doing? Two is company, three is a crowd Chuck. - He's kinda sexy. - Not as sexy as you, baby. This is where my daddy used to bring me when I was young and tell me about the old ways. Peaceful up here... That's why I want to save it for my people. Hey we don't wanna sue anybody but we have... What is that? Shoosh! I don't know. I don't get many visitors up here. Come on let's get out of here... Take the south fork, then go down stream.. - Do you still hear them? - No. No, maybe it's just someone fishing for kray fish. Yeah, maybe. Look, if you two wanna take my truck and go back to town, go ahead. No way. We came up here to talk and eat. And I make great cornbread. Okay. let's clean some fish then. (wooh) let her drift as close as you can.. - Hi, hone. - Oh You scared me. I thought you were cleaning fish. Nah, Johnny wanted to come out and see if you were alright. Ah that's so sweet. He does'nt know how tough tough like woman you are. There. Shit. I do not like this. Shut up, Stu. We agree. Let's drift in a little closer. You got it... Let's do it. Cornbread. Tommy, get down! Come on it's the whole Goddamn port. Who was it? I dunno I could not see them. Maybe that's like spitting on it. Peggy, take my truck go in town and get some help. You Coward! Keep running, you bastard! All the way back to town! Hi. Good morning. I would like to rent a boat. - I would'nt advise it, not this morning anyway. Thanks. Jerry and Peggy missing Linda dead... What the hell is going on around here? I wanna know what was Linda was doin' in Eagles truck? Yeah, what about that? You See what I see? What's that Berry Guthriffs boat? You got some explaining to do Johnny. Yeah, let's put him in real gentle now, come on. - I'm goin' with him. - Yeah, you stay with him. - Come on, get it outta' here! - Go! - How tall were they? - 6.5 maybe 7 feet tall. How many did you see? Four or five... What the hell is goin' on? What happened to my brother? Well your not gonna believe this either, they're tellin' us it's some a kind of a sea monster. That's right, sea monsters, They burned his house attacked your brother, and they even took their dead, right? Alright I'm goin' out! Anybody comin' with me? - What for? - To find evidence. So something sank the Buck-O, killed our dogs. Now it's attckin' humans, what ever it is it ain't him. I need a mate Slattery! How bout it? It's a waste of time. You affraid? Affraid of what? - Potter? - My Kid did'nt come home last night. Neither did Peggy. I gotta look for my kid.. I ain't got no time to look for phony Sea Monsters... I'll go with ya' Jim.. Wait a minute, I'm not sure I want you runnin' off before I talk to you... you want to go with me, Hank? I've got my priorities, Jim. I have to be at the hospital when your brother comes too. Alright then, your gonna have to trust him to me.. I need him, he's been there, he knows what we are lookin' for. - I'm goin' with you, Jim. - I Don't need anybody else. Oh get off your antique manors Hill, I'm a profesional scientist. Let's go. This is where we first saw them. Well, look at this. Let's see... She knows alot more than she is lettin' on. What do you supposed she's after now? Seeing, if they left any visiting cards, I guess. They've definitely been here alright. You would'nt be kidding me now would ya'? You think there are anymore of those creatures around here? I thought I heard something under there. I said, I thought I heard something. The attack pattern that you described, is that of a nocturnal predator, Which probably means that it will keep to himself during the day, unless the territory is threatened. - Is this is there home territory? - I'm Not sure. We found evidence that they were here last night, but that does'nt mean but that does'nt mean nothing. If your right about they're size, the upstream food supply won't support them, they'ed probably move to the ocean. You seem damn sure of yourself. I have to be with men like you around. Come on. Let's get out of here. Like this? That's pretty close but this head is much bigger. They must have developed more than I figured. And maybe more intelligent. Johnny, take it. Ah, damn, It's a salmon. First time I ever thought I would be disappointed in seeing a fish. Think of it this way: If we're finding salmon of this size here, We can't be to far from finding what we are looking for. I just talked to my wife on the radio. Doctor say my brother gonna be alright. Good have they talked to him yet? No he's, still unconscious. But his vital signs are strong. How much do you know your not tellin' Drake? Will you put those damn binoculars down for a minute If You've seen what I seen. You say you're intelligent, your surprised by the size their jaws. Outside of that, you seem to think your sketch is pretty accurate. - The coastline, Jim. - What about it? they're Seems to be caves out there. Where do they lead to? There's your evidence. Your nuts! No don't shoot them, not yet. No! Now, shoot! Are you alright? That's twice I owe you my life. Oh, my God. Who is it? My God, it's Peggy. She's still alive. Let's get her outta here. What the hell are these things, anyway? First, as far as I can tell. The species has only just appeard. So there has to be a reason that a humanoid creature, evolved so quickly. - Note the gills on the side of the head? - Yeah, like a fish. They do pretty well out on the land. Yes, as far as we can tell. But thier natural habitat is clearly, the water. Though I guess think there in the process of becoming amphibious. Look at the size of the cranium. That means they have a tremendous brain capacity. Does not mean though, that they have the ability to use it all. Look. webbed hands. Why don't you gentlemen go on back to Noyo? We'll let you know what we find. Forget it. We're not leaving until we get some answers. - Don't worry. - Mr. Borden strongly suggest, that we keep this quiet until Canco has had a chance to, review it. Your theory could be totally incorrect. What the hell are you talking about? I've been trying to tell you people about this for a long time and you push it aside. Well look at it, Edwards! I'ts right in front of you! You stupid! Ass, Look at it! And you still say my theory is incorrect? My theory is not incorrect and I'm not gonna keep quiet any longer. And these people have the right to know. And I'm gonna tell them. A string of DNA film 232 in the conference room. Now, Edwards! DNA-5 is a growth gene. What your seeing here is a film of our early DNA-5 experiments with frogs. These are tadpoles in the larval stage. Nornlly tadpoles take 12 weeks to become adult frogs. Now we apply DNA-5, which carries genetic information, That stimulates the growth hormone in frogs. With the aid of DNA-5, adult hood is reached in a matter of days. So what's the point? We were duplicateing this process to accelerate the growth of salmon. When heavy tidal surges tore apart one of our experimental traps. 3000-DNA treated salmon escaped into the ocean. I wanted to notify the authorities, but my employer in canco Stopped me. What if the other fish are salmon? Exactly. It's my theory that feeding on the DNA-5 treated salmon, may have brought about evolution in more primitive fish like coelacanth, which was discovered in this area a few years ago by a local marine biologist. What the heck is a coelacanth? It's a prehistoric type of fish. Which has evolved in millions of years. But may have feeding on salmon containing DNA-5. I took these in the tunnel this morning. In one lifetime, this creature seems to have evolved to four growth stages. Starts out as a fish, but is humanoid in it's final stage. Why are they attacking us? Well, most bright animals, protect thier territory and their food sources. Maybe be intelligent enough to to perceive the man as a competitor. Why the girl? My theory is that these creatures are driven to mate man now. to further develope their incredible evolution. It's enough to scare the hell outta' me. But will people in the town believe us? Jake. The festival. Oh, my God. This is Mad Man Mike Michaels broadcasting live from the big Salmon Fest. We down here at the KFISH Radio the big fish. And here's my favorite little billboard Kitty, Ah how ya' doin' Kitty. Listen, she's gonna be down on the north end of the midway If catch her, you'll win a free visor. Alright!
