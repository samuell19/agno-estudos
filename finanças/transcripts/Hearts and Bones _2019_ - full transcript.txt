Moving on to the main axis in our show for today. Our national team fails to win The Gulf Cup in its 23rd version and now hopes are high for the Olympic team. to make amends In today's show we'll talk about two main axises Firstly, we'll talk about our national team's participation in The Gulf Cup. The positive and negative aspect along the duration of the championship and the reasons behind the hard elimination from the semi finals We'll talk about our Olympic team and its coming participation in Asian Cup in China with overwhelming news about... Yeah, slow down there, bud. about calling up for players... Yeah, stop here, stop here. We'll discuss these topic with our guest for today's show Please welcome captain Qussai Hashim our international X player Welcome to our show, captain. Hello and thank you and your audience for having me. Let get right into it, captain. What do you think of our national team in The Gulf Cup? This is not safe, Dan. Can you read that? Maasoum Asiz, he's a local councillor. What's that? Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Hey, it's okay. It's okay! Dan, please! Get back! There are landmines. Okay, okay. It's okay. No! Last year we heard a number of times that the crisis in Syria has reached a tipping point. It did Well I don't use tipping points or decision points for a simple reason that I think in the progression of history there are certain points that we'll look back and say that was a critical day. Yesterday was a very critical day. I mean this was going for the jugular, and they did. The opposition to Cassa, to have struck down his own brother-in-law, one of the strongest, toughest men in the regime, a man blamed by the United Nations, by the way for murdering Jessica Haimie. - Hey. - Hi. - G'day mate, how are you? - How are you doing? Okay, thanks. No problem, you have whatever you want. All right. All right, thank you. Calling commission by the conservative think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs or the IPA. Strong progressions that so much very carefully selects one. Can see the act. Which also makes it an offence to humiliate or intimidate a person based on their race. James Pattison used to work for the IPA. These days though he's a liberal Senator in Victoria. Hey. Back again? Yes, is it all right? Yeah, knock yourself out. My wife has agreed to look at the house. Yeah that's good, really good. Oh, Dan, thanks. Sorry to rush you, mate, but we're on the air in seconds so take this mic here. This one? Now do you need a glass of water or something? No I'm fine, - thank you. - Okay, if you could just put the cans on. Ready to go? Okay we're on in 10 seconds. Okay. Quiet now. Across Australia, you're with Fran Kelly, Radio National Breakfast. You're listening to RN Breakfast and our next guest has spent much of the last couple of decades documenting human pain and misery really, all over the world. Dan Fisher, welcome to RN Breakfast. Thank you. Dan, your work is well known all over the world, but strangely, it's rarely shown here. And our Minister for Board of Protection describes your photographs as misery porn. What do you think of that description? Have you heard that before? Have you had to respond to that before? Look, I photograph what my conscience asks me to. Even if it's hard to see, to watch. Hopefully the images I take enable us to say of the subject, "We can see you, we understand your plight. "You're not collateral damage." We're speaking with award-winning war photographer Daniel Fisher. Dan's work will feature at the Testament Festival at the State Library later this year. Dan, do you think we've become desensitised to these kind of images? I hope not. So I heard the interview. Yeah, well, I can only be as interesting as the questions, Ada. Listen, we're all super excited about your involvement in this festival. If I could just get another image for the promotional material, something not too off-putting. Yep. It's marketing, Dan. I didn't realise we were selling anything. Of course we are. It's a family event. We don't want to give the kids nightmares. We're not dropping bombs on them. It's the bombs that give them the nightmares. Dan. Okay, I'll find a photo of an orphan with a puppy. No puppies. Partners don't like third world dogs. They like their dogs well fed. Jeez. Dan, are you home? Gotta go, Josie's here. Say hi to Josie for me. I will. Ada says hi! Welcome home! The washing machine's buggered again. You're soaked. How was the trip? It was good. That's good. What's with all the boxes? I'm just trying to tidy up. I missed you this trip. I always miss you. I bought strawberries. Hi there. Hi. I'm looking for the photographer, Daniel Fisher. He will be in your Testament Exhibition. Oh, no, he doesn't actually work here. You could ask our Special Projects Curator. Her email's on the back of this brochure. I wish to send him an invitation. Have you tried his website? Actually, I can do How was the trip? Good. Really? I'll tell you about it later. I've got it. All right, I'm coming! Hi, my friend. Hello. I'm Sebastian Ahmed. Okay, I didn't call a taxi, you know. I'm looking for Daniel Fisher, the photographer. Well you found him, that's me. I heard you on the radio. Your radio interview. You were talking of hope. Are you a man of hope, sir? Not generally, no. What is it you want? I have formed a community choir and it's my hope that you can photograph us. I'm not that kind of photographer, man. Daniel Fisher from Sydney, Australia. You have been to my country of South Sudan. You know there is much repair work for us to do. I wish you to photograph our contribution. I'll get you a contact, just hang on. Daniel. I wish to invite you to the Croydon community centre. We are there every Tuesday from seven o'clock. Now look, Leo, I'm the wrong man, okay? Did you want me to sign that? No, thank you. Okay, just wait here. I'll get you a phone number. Who was it? Some man, South Sudanese. Taxi driver looking for a photographer. Dan, I'm pregnant. 15 weeks. I've had all the tests, everything's fine, I'm fine, the baby's fine. I thought we decided. I know. I wanted to get the all clear before I told you. Fuck. I thought you'd be pleased. I am. I thought we decided! I know. Do I get a say in this? Of course. But Dan, this is happening. What's that meant to mean? Dan. Dan? Dan! Are you all right? Are you okay? You don't have to wait. I will wait. Do you have many pictures of my village outside Maridi in South Sudan? I've no idea. Thank you for helping me, but, really you don't need to wait. My friend, we can help you. Graham, you didn't have to come. The doctor says that you can go home tomorrow. What happened? I don't know, I just tripped. Jesus. Graham Fisher, Dan's brother. I'm Sebastian Ahmed, pleased to meet you. Mr. Ahmed brought Dan in his taxi. Well, what do we owe you? No, please. Be well, Daniel Fisher from Sydney, Australia. Hang on. Mr. Ahmed. Sorry. Sorry, were you there when he fell? Yeah. What happened? He tripped, as he said. And I didn't really see what happened. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. - Thank you. - No worries. Hello. - How are you? - How are you? No, he is sleeping. - Oh, sorry. - Sleeping. Hello, my darling. Have you ever experienced memory loss before? No. Yes. Yes, he has. Any headaches? Coordination issues? No. He doesn't sleep. Well I've never really slept. He's restless all night, he wakes suddenly. Have you ever had a head trauma? Some, yeah. What, more than one? Yeah. From mainly small artillery. Mortars, land mines, you know other munitions like IEDs, grenades, that sort of thing. In close proximity? Yeah. Repeat exposure? Yep. And over what period of time, months? Years? Decades. Okay. Any panic attacks? Yes. Traumatic flashbacks? Yeah. Okay. This is the hippocampus. Now since your last scan, there's a We're gonna sit with our feet together, spines tall. Guys, if it's a bit uncomfortable to sit with your feet together, you can have your legs crossed if that feels better for you. Let's place one hand on the belly and one hand on the heart. So in the centre of your chest. Nice, and guys you can do the same. So one hand on your partner's belly and one hand in the middle of your chest. I have facilities, I'm prepared to share them. I have a business, I'm prepared to share, I also have an excellent financial advisor. And did I mention I will soon have a boat. Your new archive. Well, what Josie's been able to pack up, I gather you're dragging your feet. I started scanning a long shortlist. I thought you were flat out. Well I'm here for you, okay? We all are. I'm making a file of selects for you to have a look at too. There are some great shots. This exhibition is gonna be a cracker. When do we move the rest? I wanted to talk about mum's rings. Mum's wedding ring? About bloody time. I thought I might surprise Jos before I go. You're not going away, Dan. Well that's my decision to make. You sure Claire doesn't want them? If I'd given Claire an engagement ring as small as that, she would have dumped my ass. Anyway you know Claire. Phobic of that second hand shit. Videos like these tell a familiar story from inside Syria. Like most, they're hard to verify but appear to show evidence of the Assad regime's assault on the city of Hama. Not all violence is so easily visible. Amnesty International says the tactics are being used on prisoners. The methods of torture is returned to Just a minute please. One, two, three, four. That was beautiful. We hope you will fall in love with us and in voices of hope. You are one of us. I am not sure that I am really. We also suffer with Post Traumatic Stress. We shake off the bad spirit. Don't be ashamed, my brother. Yes, don't be ashamed, it's easy, look. See? I'm Sebastian Ahmed from South Sudan. High Equatoria region. And I'm Mohamed Bangoura. I'm from Guinea. I am Timpani, I am from Zimbabwe which is in the south, and part of Africa. I'm Eric Ndabunguye from DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa. My name is Dereb Desalegn. I'm from Ethiopia. My name is Sammla Stole. I'm from South Africa. My name is Rassin Kassang and I'm from Syria, what is left of Syria. And I'm Daniel Fisher and I'm from Sydney, Australia. Do you remember Maridi? No. Well not fully, not really, no. There was a massacre. Yeah. You were there. In your book there are photographs. I know, but, that was 15 years ago and my memory's full of holes. I understand. Many died. All my family. I'm sorry about your family. Thanks, God. I have a wish that you will not display photograph of my village to the Australian public. We do not deserve to be judged. People won't judge. They always judge us but they cannot understand. Well that's exactly why the photos need to be seen. I cannot agree. There have been enough suffering. Our choirs are what the subject for the Testament exhibition. Look, I haven't made my final decision. We are brothers, yes? Goodbye. Goodbye. It's still here. Sebastian, if no one wants it, it must be a dump, eh? What could be wrong with it, it's a house. A house cannot be built on air. It must be built on land. Kalmi, you'll have a garden with veggies and a chicken palace! All I'm saying is for the same amount of money we can have a nice clean apartment with nothing that needs fixing. Oh, you need a haircut. So cut it. Go to the barber. I like it better when you'll do it. After your shift. Anishka, you are a bully. I can't help it if I know what's best for everyone, eh? She here? Oh, oh. - Wait, wait. - I think I'll get the bag. Wait a second. - Good morning. - Good morning, how are you? I'm good, how are you? Well thank you. That's good. She's good today. - Yeah, she's been good? - Yeah, she's good. She's ready, okay. Ah, thank you. Coming up, up up up, heels on the ground, good. Look at the hand, present it. Come back, great. Okay let's get rid of the bars. Pick sticks. Very good. And this one's Haiti. Shall we start with the published works? Yes. And just as a way in? We were thinking of breaking it down by country rather than year. Sure. Great. I'm not sure about these. They're one of your best known. It's Sebastian Ahmed's village. The taxi driver? You know someone from here? He set up a community choir. He wants me to photograph them. They're pretty good. Great story. He asked me not to exhibit photos of his village. Why? His family died in the massacre there. All the more reason to include them. You're making sure they're not forgotten. Can we talk some more about the Sudanese pictures? You've worked so hard not to censor yourself and now a taxi driver's telling you what to do? Eve's. These booties. Oh, don't scalp me. You said short. The hair, not me. Then stop wriggling. I'm too excited. I don't want to move. I love it here. What do you love so much? The carpet. It's my favourite colour, puke. And it's provide us with free electricity. And I love the stain on the ceiling. The obscene mystery stain? Mhmm, yes. The very one. Careful, Sebastian. I know that you are allergic to our new house. But I will make it perfect. How? You already work nonstop. When we are safe in our own piece of this earth, we can begin our true life. We work. That is our life. It's all we ever do. Sebastian, one day you'll look at the tired old woman in your bed and you'll say "Who is this?" And I'll say, "It's me, remember?" Oh, Sebastian, look, I'm covered in hair. It's too much. I have to have another shower. Come on, I'll scrub your back, old man. I'm shy. You are not shy. That was good. I forgot my part. Do a bit faster? Faster? Miss that note. No, 'cause I missed a note. Let's do it once more. Oh! - Hello. - My friend. Come, come, come, join us. No, no, no, no. Please don't let me interrupt. Come and sing. No, I can't sing, I can't sing. People are more scared to sing than to shoot a gun. Oh, I understand that. Where is your camera? Oh, come, don't worry. Just come, come sit. - Hello. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Mohamed, hi. - How you doing? How you do? Hey, hey. Please. Thank you, good night. See you, see you, - see you, goodbye. - All right, goodbye. See you, take care. Really good singing, beautiful. Who's catching a train with me? Can I give you a lift? That's kind of you. Yeah? - Thank you. - Okay. When will you bring your camera? What, so I can record your good deed for Allah? God already knows everything. For each of us there is an angel to record our deeds. Oh, I don't believe in angels. I'm an infidel. Angels are not deterred by your lack of faith. I'm parked there. Yeah, you parked there? Right up the back? Yeah. Thanks for the ride. It's my pleasure, Sebastian, thank you. Come, you will meet my family. No, I should go, really, thanks. Please, we are already here. They will love to meet you. Okay. Yeah. Not too long though. All right. You must not butt in and discuss my wife by speaking the past. I have never told her about my life from before. Do you tell your wife what you witness when you are away? Not everything, no. You see, there is too much pain. A man must protect his family. I understand. Yeah, please, let's go. Are you done? One more spoon? One more, nope? Here comes the train. There we go, good girl. Anishka. Daniel, this is my wife Anishka. Hi Anishka. Anishka, this is Daniel. Hello, hello. Sebastian, eh? Why didn't you tell me you were bringing somebody home? Ah it's all right. Don't worry, Nish. - Sorry. - Sorry. It's okay. - We're here. - So. - Is it okay? - Daddy's back. Maybe I should go. Ah no, it's all right, it's okay. Please, please be seated. - Okay. - Yeah. This is Kalmira. - Hello, Kalmira. - What a cutie face. Hello. The place is a mess. I will tidy up. Oh, please. The tea? Yes. Beautiful. This is a mess, - the entire thing. - I will cook a curry. What with? - What with? - Please don't go to any trouble. All we have is leftovers from the restaurant. That sounds great. It'll only take a minute to prepare. Daniel is a photographer that I'm praying that he will chronicle our voices of hope. - Okay. - Yeah. I will heat up the food. I will heat up the food. It's all right. Please, Daniel, feel at home please. Okay, thank you. All I'm saying is for the same amount of money we can have a nice clean apartment. Thank you. Our apartment is built on air. Land is security. Only land. Listen to Scarlett O'hara. As God as my witness, I will never be homeless again. I'm just teasing you. Land, land, land. With your friend, it is always land. You're yawning. I know, she's very, you are tired my darling. It was nice to meet you Dan, I'm going to take her to sleep. You too Anishka, thank you. Thank you so much. Come to mama. Land is security. Sebastian, let go of the land situation. Say goodnight, say goodnight. Don't excite her. Always before bedtime you will excite her. You are always nibbling at her. No, not always nibbling at my baby. Good night, Anishka. Good night. Thank you. You heard our choir and now you have seen my heart. You understand I would like to see any other photographs of my village? Really? You're not strong enough to bear witness alone, my friend. Okay. Okay. Thanks for tonight, thank you. All right. Oh god. You okay? Yeah I'm fine. Go back to sleep. What are you doing? Sebastian wants to see the photos of his village. You don't need his permission. I know, but it's his history. It's your life's work. Hasn't made a difference, has it? You can't know that. I've got a brain full of plaque for what? Right, go. You go back to bed. I'm a mess. Why is it easier for you to talk to a stranger than me? Why don't you come to the choir with me? You'll love it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Sebastian, Anishka, Kalmira, Hello. - Hello. - Welcome. Sebastian, today, you have guaranteed your future here in this great country. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you. - Thank you. - Now let's cut the cake. Anishka doesn't know anything about the photos. Okay. I don't think he's told her anything about his past at all. You're kidding. Sebastian. - Oh, Dan. - Congratulations. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. - You remember Josie? - Hello. - So lovely to see you again. - Josie, how are you? Good to see you too. Hi, Anishka. Hello Dan, how are you? This is Josie, my partner. Anishka. Congratulations on the house. Thanks. We're running out of space at the apartment. Oh! Double congratulations! How long? Four months, yes. Oh and you too, Dan tells us about the bub. So when are you moving in? It may be some months before the house is ready. It's got potential. At the moment, that's all it's got. Oh dear. Hey. I'm here to steal the baby, show it to the band. Ah! You pull the car here over. What's wrong? Can you pull the car over, please, Jos? What's wrong? Dan, what's wrong? Dan? What is it? Why didn't you tell me straight away you were pregnant? You were in the field. I didn't wanna worry you. So you decided for me, did you? I was being considerate. What is going on? I would have liked to know. That's not how it works, is it? You wanna help choose the photos so that's what happens. You wanna renovate, we renovate. You want us to stay in Sydney so I spent half my life in the air. You want another baby, righty-o. What about what I want? You do what you want all the time. You always have. I make plenty of compromises. It's not my fault that you're unwell! I know how hard this is for you, your life is changing. Oh, Jesus, that's fucking words, one way of putting it, look at me. If I could donate an organ to fix you, I would. But it's not all bad. Your work is being honoured. You can improve physically. You've got me and the baby. But I could lose you and the baby. There is no way I would have wanted you to risk having this child after what happened. You know that! And that's why you didn't tell me! How many times have you risked your life without asking me first? All right. I'll leave you to it. Stay, please. Stay. This was my favourite time of year before the wet season. They would take new calves out on the valley. I was with my first wife then. Where is she now? Raped. Then murdered with machetes. You don't have to put yourself through this. You have opened a door to the past. I must go through. All men would go there to a meeting. All the women and children were at home. We didn't know there were militia in the area, teenage boys drinking paint stripper. Paint stripper, not beer. I try to find a reason for what happened. There was no reason. I can see in my mind the feast of bull flies biting each other. You know the big flies that bite? I think we call them horseflies maybe. We call them bull flies. Because they charge at us. They come from the earth when they smell sweat and blood. One charges at a boy, bites him. He is angry. The boy fires his weapon and the rest join him. It is a frenzy. The frenzy, they will desire to feel it again for the rest of their lives. We heard the shots and we ran to our homes. I had two sons. And the youngest had beautiful daughter. You were a witness but you don't remember. You are fortunate. But we are no longer victims. You take them. You take them. G'day. Hey, hey, hey. Please, get other taxi. I'm not going far. I'm finished for the day. - Hey just drive, pal. - See there is no light here. You need to get up. Just drive the fucking cabbie, mate. - I'm not getting out! - I'm asking you to get out now. Drive! You're a taxi, fine! Fuckin! Look at this! Get out! Hello. Get out! You all right? You all right, mate. Get out! She's all right, settle down, mate. All right, settle down. All right, all right, all right! You have no right! Hello? Dan. It is my daughter, it is Mariam. They are all dead. All the families. And you buried them yourself? Yes, we buried with our own hands. But there were many. Perhaps my tears made me blind. Let me check the dates and the times. Sebastian, I have a contract with the Red Cross. No. They can help you find her. No. Look, nothing bad's gonna happen. Are you here legally? Of course. I have every citizenship proof. Sorry, it's okay. My passport and my certificate of marriage, my driver licence and my tax returns. I understand, it's okay. What if she is alive? What then? I'll help you find her. But you'll need to tell Anishka. Yay! The drier will conk out next. We're in here. Oh, where are you going? This is the Red Cross. Do you want me to do this for you? I can take the documents in. No, no, no. It's all right with me. Okay, you stay here, okay? Stay here, I'll be right back. - You sure you wanna go in? - Stay here. Absolutely. Stay right there. Dan. It's okay, stay there. Sebastian. This is Janine. Hi, Sebastian. Hi, how are you? Now Janine needs to photocopy your documents. - It's all right. - No I actually - need to keep this one. - It's okay. She needs to photocopy these and you need to fill in this form. I'll be right back. All right. It's okay. You're sure of her? She's a good friend. She looks dangerous. She's not dangerous at all. Now this is an application form. We fill this in just one by one. Yeah. - Dan. - Give it back to Janine. Dan, I'm really sorry. You know I didn't want to come here. I know. You are true friend of mine. I will show you my new house. I'd love that. But first we fill in the form, yeah? Yeah. This place is very dangerous. I understand. So date of birth. This is the main... Bathroom, yeah. Yeah it's the main bathroom where you place the tub and make it just perfect. A little bit of painting and make it a good place to live in, yeah. Nice and strong. Yeah, very strong. Ah there's fleas. It's a old carpet. This is the reason Anishka doesn't like coming here. You got some nice boards here I think. - Yeah, oh. - Yeah. Oh really we can actually, it's a good wood, man. That's right. Yeah, it's a good wood. They're good boards. Do you wanna pull it up? Get rid of the whole thing, get rid of the fleas? Yes, yes, please, let's do it. They're beautiful. - Yeah? - They're beautiful, they're beautiful. You good? It's good, yeah. Thanks. I suppose I could do you. Yup. Oh dear. Running water. The world is full of miracles. Yeah. You're gonna want a hand sanding those floors in there. You would do that? Yeah. You would help me? Yeah. Of course I'd help you. That's good. Where have you been? Shh. Don't use that trick with me. I've been to our new house. The floor is good good. Dan helped me tear up the carpets. Look at the time, eh? I'm sorry. But I've never been so happy. Never in my life. I better have a shower. Sit with me. What's it? There we go. I have a very strong heartbeat. Do you wanna know the sex? Yeah. - Yes, yes. - Yeah. Okay, let's have a look. There we are. It's a girl. You okay? Aw. It's good to see you here together. Now, I would like to talk about Eve. Do you make time to remember her? We used to. We had lots of photos up. And then we felt we should try to move on. That's understandable. I've been thinking about her a lot lately. Well I can recommend some good people to offer support if you need it. The complications around Eve's birth is obviously a concern. And with a second pregnancy the risks are higher. What are the figures? Well it's hard to say. Well, might give it a go, eh? - Dan, please. - No, no, that's fine. It's a fair question. Around 15% of foetuses affected by a placental abruption died and there is one in four chance that Josie will develop the condition again. Now Josie, for you personally the risks are low but there, - Excuse me. - Mmm. Dan. Dan. You all right to drive yourself home? Is it him? With the gun? Yeah. Yup. Busy night. Not bad. Did you have a nice evening off? Mmm. What is wrong? I must tell you something. Okay. You'll have many feelings about it. What is it? I want you to know once I had another wife with two sons. And I once had another daughter. I thought they were all dead. But my daughter could be still alive. Her name is Mariam. So we could see from the scarification and from the ring that it was him. Well maybe he, you should go to the police. He could be a war criminal. He's not, he's not a criminal, he's not a criminal. He's standing there with a gun to somebody's head. It's obvious why he doesn't want it exhibited. He's been manipulating you. Is there any way I can you know, just pull out of this festival? Why? What is the whole point of it? Don't sabotage yourself now, Dan. On a happier note, I know I said we wouldn't buy anything just yet but I couldn't help it! Tada! - For you. - Wow, so many. - And for you, my darling. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, they're beautiful. Jos, which one do you want? And they do come with the heel. Thank you. To Dan. Soon to be father and his lovely wife. Ooh, sorry, has he popped the question yet? Nah. No one can ever replace your beautiful Eve. She was a perfect package and we all ache to hold her each day. But life goes on even though sometimes you wish it wouldn't and there are times you think you're doing okay, that you think you're gonna make it and then you'll see something or hear a song and, you'll feel exactly like you did the day she died. But there will come a day when the thought of your little girl will bring a smile before it brings a tear. To Dan and Josie, soon to be wonderful parents. Thank you Graham. There's still one more. Oh blimey, gosh. You've been shopping, girl. Nish. You need to stop talking. I can't hear any more. But I've only ever wanted... I have to catch up. Stop, please. I'm heartbroken for you that you lost your family. But I'm, I'm very angry. Of course. No, stop please. Please, just. Sebastian, stop, Sebastian. - Sebastian stop! - You and Kamli. Stop. It is not for me that you lied. I don't need protecting, I'm not a child. Who am I to you? Who am I to you? - You are everything. - Who am I to? You are everything. Who? Everything. I need you to stay at the house for a few days. Nah, it's too hard... Just a few days. So I can catch up. - Now please... - This is doing my head in. Now, please. We need to resolve this, let's talk. Let's talk. Sebastian? I told Anishka. Did she throw you out? She needed space. I'm tired, I will skip choir practise tonight. There's something I need to talk to you about. That photograph. The man with the gun. That's you, isn't it? Why didn't you just tell me? Now you are judging me. I'm not judging you. Look, just be straight with me for once, okay? Get out. Get out! You lied to me. Never! You lied to yourself. You see the scared black man kneeling on the ground and you think it must be me? That's bullshit! Get out! I remember everything! It was a war! I killed the man who killed my family! And I would do it again and again and any man would! Now before they killed my son, before they butchered my son, my son said to me, "Father, don't worry. "I will tell God everything and he will make it right." He was only five years old, five years old! Just do what you can, Jos. It's bleeding. I can't, you need stitches. They're expecting you at the surgery. I'm fine. You need to see the doctor! Are you going to report him? He attacked you. You weren't there! I'll drive myself. Dan, Dan, your phone. Anishka? Hi, hi, it's Josie Avril. Dan's partner. How are you? I'm good. Look, I need to show you something. That was quick. Sorry, Josie, it's me. Can I talk to Dan please? He's upstairs, what do you want? I just want to talk to him. - Allow me to talk to him. - I'm sorry, please leave. You know, to hurt Dan is unforgivable. I never ever wanted to hurt anyone. So please allow me to talk to him. You should have told him the truth. Yeah I know. Please, let me just talk to him. I just want to apologise to him. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Please allow me. Dan can't help you anymore, Sebastian. Please allow me. Do you miss it? I did, when I stopped. But ballet's not an easy life. It's not as romantic as it looks. How long to go? A few months. Must be a girl. You're carrying high. Are you all right, Anishka? Sebastian's a good man. I'm sure he is. I don't think anyone can keep their life hidden like that without paying a price. I think he needs help. You mean counselling. He's been through so much. So have you. Losing your daughter. It hasn't been easy. No pictures though. What do you mean? No pictures of you during the worst moment of your life. Losing everything, burying your dead, hope gone. Dignity, gone. There are no pictures of you in hell. When you lost everything, I bet people showed some respect. Looked the other way. Eh? How dare you. Oh my god. Who are you? Hmm? I'm going crazy. Except I can't. Because I'm pregnant and I have a baby to look after and a 12 hour workday tomorrow. You have put our family in danger, Sebastian. I won't be moving here. And I don't want you. You are on your own. You can't do this. Dan. You need help. I spoke to Anishka. What? I rang her. Dan, Dan! Just stop for a minute and tell me what you think you're doing. I'm going to Syria. I'm doing my job. Do you remember what the neurologist told us? Look, let me call Graham. Just come inside. Please. Please, just stay here with me. Just for tonight. We need you. Sebastian came here. What do you mean? I don't want him coming here, Dan. Please, Dan! Dan! Dan, please! Verily we belong to God and verily to Him do we return. Hello! Hey! Are you in there? Now listen. I don't know what he's up to in there but he was making a hell of a racket. I knocked on the door but I am. Yep, all right, thanks. Sebastian? Sebastian! Dan, Dan, Dan! What's happening? It's okay, it's okay, - it's okay. - What's going on? Wait, what, what? - It's okay sweety. - What? Tell me, tell me, - tell me. - Sebastian tried - to kill himself. - What? What? Medic! Dan? Hello? Dan? Where are you? Dan? Jos. Yeah, yeah I'm here. I'm scared. Just tell me where you are. It's all right. Come on. Thank you very much, very much. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Nice to see you. Nice to see you too. Hello, all right. - I'm fine. - Anishka. Hello my brother. I'm good, thank you. Open the door, open the door. Slow down, slow down, you're gonna trip on that step. You good? Yeah. Hey Nish. Hello, Dan, how are you? Good, how are you? I'm good, thank you. Is he up? He's out in the back. I've got some news for him. Can I help? Hey, Seb. Dan. They found Mariam. She wants to meet you. Yeah. My friend. You must exhibit photograph from my village. The man with the gun, he is a part of me. Yeah. Yeah. It's all amazing. Okay, everyone ready? We are going to sing now.
