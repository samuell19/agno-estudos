[SNORING] [SNORING CONTINUES] [STUDENTS LAUGH] Yay! [CHUCKLES] Benji say sorry. Or what? Get out! You're a Nimbecile! [STUDENTS LAUGH] [MUMBLES] [GUN COCKS] [INTENSE MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] [NIMBE] I wasn't always this guy. In fact, I was far from this guy. [TRAFFIC NOISE] [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] I am ready. - Where is Nimbe? - Ah. Nimbe! Oluwanimbe! [NIMBE] Ma? Come outside now! Look at you, you haven't finished dressing up. I'm almost done, ma. Can you see him? Don't hurry up. Don't mind him. - Don't hurry up, Idiot! - Uh-oh. I don't even know where you were picked up from. [UDUAK] Oh, fool. Uh-oh. See his eyes. Take it easy, these kind of things are not good. You always insult the child, it's not good. I won't only take it easy, you might as well beat me because of your son. - Hmm. - Don't be angry. [WHISPERING] What about the math set? - What is it? - [MUMBLES] Hmm... It's the math set I spoke to you about please give me the money, let's give him to go to school. You spoke to me about math set? Yes, mathematical set. For what? For his school, of course. Which school? The school he attends. Am I the one to buy math set again? Why won't you buy a math set, is the one that... Uh-uh. What happened to the one you had before? He said what happened to the one you had before? Speak up now. [HESITATES] I misplaced it. [NIMBE'S MOM] You misplaced it? I bought a math set for you and you misplaced it? Don't mind him. You misplaced your math set, and you want me to buy another one, right? - There's something wrong with you, idiot! - Uh-uh. [IN YORUBA] I bought something for you and you misplaced it out of stupidity. Papa Nimbe, take it easy. The last time we bought math set for this boy was when he was in JSS3, now he is in SS2 we're supposed to buy another one. So, I have to buy math set every day? It's not an everyday occurrence. Is it because of N300 that you're shining your eyes like this? - Huh? - Won't he go to school? So, N300 is ordinary? If it is ordinary, go and get N3000 and give to your son. Aren't you the head of the house? Listen! As for me, I don't have a dime to give you to buy a math set. If that math set won't let you go to school today, no problem. Take your shirt off and follow me to the site now! Now! [EXCLAIMS] [IN YORUBA] Two stupid people that I have at home. I'm waiting for you outside, I give you just two minutes. If you don't want to go to school, take your shirt off and meet me outside now. Don't mind your father. Let me tell you something. Your father just received a call that has spoiled his mood and he's trying to take it out on me. You realize I'm the one he's insulting and not you. But don't mind him, you know what I will do? By the time I get back from the shop, I will make sure I collect the money from him for you, is that clear? Don't be upset. But, mommy, If I don't have the math set, I won't be allowed into math class. Then, so be it. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to turn myself into a math set for you? I already told you that when your father returns tonight, I will get it for you. You're still grumbling. Wait! Don't tell me that if you miss class for just today you will fail? Don't try to play smart with me and say you will fail in this house. Because we will both die there, I have told you. - No... - What nonsense is he saying? I can't miss class. You're not missing anything, please. I can't miss class. What's my business if you miss class? Your lunch money is under the tin, take it. Lock the door and keep the key in the usual spot. Don't come back to this house telling me you have failed. Because you and I will kill ourselves. [GRUMBLING] Mommy, mommy, mommy... What do you want me to do now? I... I want my math set. I have heard you, when I get back, I will make some sales at the shop and give you the money for the math set. - Hmm... - Okay, smile now and I will still help you get the money from your father in the evening making it double for you. Will you laugh now? See your ears, you look too much like your father. Now go to school, take the money, lock the door so, you don't get to school late. - Okay, mom. Okay, bye-bye. - Hm? [STUDENTS DRUMMING AND SINGING] [SHUSHES] [SNIFFS] [CLEARS THROAT] How far, Nimbecile? Isn't it you I am greeting? Good Morning, Benji. Is that Mama Ebuka's akara I'm smelling? [SNIFFING] Yes!

[TV AUDIO] [UDUAK IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] All these people are crazy. Now, which idiot? I said which idiot changed what I was watching? But why are you calling me an idiot? I came here, and I didn't meet you. I'm just sitting in peace watching my TV program and you're calling me an idiot? So if I don't call you an idiot, you wouldn't know you're an idiot? - Huh? - You're an idiot, of course. I was watching something. Didn't you know I was watching football and you changed the station? I didn't know, I didn't see anyone here. So if you didn't meet me here, when you came with your stupid and bad luck. You want me to spell it out for you? - Hmm? - Isn't my incarnation here?

Look at the time, a responsible housewife who hasn't made dinner at this time of the night. Am I to starve to death? Isn't it the food that's cooking? The food is on fire? Whenever you're hungry, that's when you get upset and restless. Is it me that you're calling restless? You're crazy, if you're well born, you'll get up and go check the food that's cooking. Idiot, a responsible housewife eating groundnut and dinner is not ready. [BAYO] Dinner isn't ready for me to eat and you're eating ground nuts. [UDUAK] I wanted to eat it while watching my program. [BAYO] What effrontery? [TEACHER] Do we have any ten over ten? Anyone, ten over ten? Alright, nine over ten. Oh really, very good, seat, very good. Eight to five over ten? Alright, have your seat. Hmm... [TEACHER CHUCKLES] I'm not surprised. Benji, what was your score? Two, ma. - [CLASS LAUGH] - Hey! Two over ten, you should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you. Read, you will not read. All you know how to do is to keep disturbing the peace of the class and the entire school and giving your teachers headache here and there. Look at them, judgement day is coming, you know judgement day is my specialty. I love judgment days, because then you will know who is who. Your exams are coming, if you like don't read. Have your seat! Sit down! I'm waiting for judgement day. [CHUCKLES] - Judgment day. - There you go. Nimbe. Benji, not now, please, I don't want any trouble. We come in peace, we just want your Agric note. But, there's a test tomorrow. We know, that's why we need it. But I need to revise it. You need story, check the bag. No, no, no. Benji, stop this. No, no... This is wrong. Yes, yes, this is it. Benji, this is not fair. Thank you very much. Hey! Give the book back to him. [NIMBE] Thank you. [UPBEAT MUSIC] No! No! No! No! No! No! [LAUGHS] [BAYO] Where's the food I sent you to buy? I said where is my food? Do you want me to slap you as you're standing there acting deaf? I said where is my food? No, Sir. Sir, it's Benji. Benji is my food? No! Him and Chukwudi tripped me as I was coming back from where you sent me. Who is Benji? Benji, the son of Ikechukwu's mother? [SPLUTTERING] Yes, sir. He poured my food away. Yes, sir. I sent you to buy food and Benji poured it away? What did you now do to Benji? I didn't want to fight, sir, so I told him God would judge him. [LAUGHS] God will judge him... See bishop... [LAUGHS] You want to turn to a bishop in my house? I sent you to buy food, you're telling me you don't want to fight? If you were born well, leave that spot where you're standing. Ha! If you were born well, just lift one leg there. You're crazy, I sent you to buy food. He poured it away, and you are here saying you don't want to fight. Please... Today, you must fight that fight you don't want to fight. If you say you want to be a bastard boy, I will help you achieve that. Where is Benji? In two minutes' time now, you will take your boy to the hospital. You're the one that will die. You will take your son to the hospital. Make sure you teach this palm oil eating boy and his useless father an unforgettable lesson. You hear? The only thing that can make you stop that is if this boy is truly a bastard boy, and he doesn't beat this boy. Benji, you're not a bastard, you're just like your father. You're the one always causing trouble on this street. Hello, are you ready? Action! My son, please. Action! Thank you, my son. Yeah! - [CROWD CHEERING] - Go back! - Thank you, my son. - Go back. [CROWD CHEERING] - [BLABBERING] - Hey! Are you sick? It won't be well with anyone who tries to separate them. [WOMAN IN YORUBA] Don't let them fight. Yes, you're coming up, you're coming up. [CROWD CHEERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BENJI'S MOM] Yay... Stupid father. [BAYO] If your mother was well born, you come back home. If you talk, I will put this thing in your mouth and pull your mouth out. I know one day, I will get my own child... that will be a true reflection of me. That I would be proud of. That this boy is my boy. Not this stupid one. Not this bastard boy. I always say it, that it's not everyone that is called "papa" that deserves to be a father. And no man, no father will send his child to fight like a tout. - Do you realize you're senseless? - [SNICKERS] I know another day is coming, that one stupid man will knock at this door, and he will come into my beautiful sitting room. Will he come to beat me? He will come to claim this stupid boy, because I am not his father. - You're not his father, right? - His father will come to claim him. - You're not his father, right? - I'm not his father. You're not his father, right? You're the one that know where you got him from. You know what? Today, you will show me the father of this child. - Huh? - You keep saying it and I always keep quiet. You think I am stupid like you? - You know what? - Who is his father? - You know what? - What? - If you were born well... - If you were born well too... - If you were born well... - If you were born well too... - Because of your bad luck... - You are bad luck too. - You just stand up and come to meet me. - You can't do anything. Is this what your mates are doing? - You just stand up, come and meet me. - Is this what your mates are doing? - Tell me. - You know all the time you act like Jackie Chan and Jet Li, but today, I have your time. Just tell me what my people do. What are you saying? What are my mates doing that I am not doing? What do you know how to do? You're just tall for nothing. You don't have anything at the top and bottom, everything about you is useless. You're a bad luck. How am I bad luck? [BAYO] I know one day, I will get my own child... That I would be proud of. Not this stupid one. Not this bastard boy. I don't know where they brought you from... [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hi. Hello. I'm Ralph. You can call me Nimbe for short. So, what are you doing here all alone? Nothing, I just come here once a while to clear my head whenever I need to. So how's the bruise? What bruise? The bruise, I mean, I saw you fought the other guy that day. You can mock me all you want because you helped me get my book from Benji. No, I don't mean to mock you, man. I just thought you had a good fight, that's all. No, I didn't. I disgraced myself. I disgraced my father. Well, your father was not supposed to put that much pressure on you to fight that guy. Can I take a look? Yes, of course. What is this? It's a representation of how I feel right now. And how do you feel? Sad. Angry. Lonely. I feel like a loser. So, painting and drawing helps me keep calm. Hmm. What is it? It's a drink, it's medicinal, it will help calm your nerves. But we are not friends, why are you trying to be nice? Oh, because everybody deserves a friend at a moment like this. Take it. [GROANS] Yeah, how do you feel? I don't know! Come on, it felt good, man. Ha-ha! Guy, look at your face. Wait! You smoke? Sort of. Aren't you too young for that? You know how drawing makes you feel better? How this stuff I gave just made you feel good? Well this, let's just say this caps it all. This stick, if God, you know, counts you as blessed to take a drug, this would take all of your frustration and fears away, man. One drag and all your problems are gone, it's heaven. Ah! No, I have never smoked before. Well, there's always a first time for everything. If my father catches me, he will just kill me. Well, then, he doesn't have to know. Take it. [COUGHS] [RALPH] Easy, easy, easy... [AK] The ban on those substances has created a gap. And the gap is getting bigger and bigger with each passing day, especially in the north. Oh... You want to use my distribution network in the north I suppose? Not just as a distributor, Abu, we have come a long way as friends. It's time we stepped things up a little. I want you to become my partner. - Oh, partner? - Yes. The gap in the market right now is huge and I want us to work together. Two good heads are better than one. Abu, this is our time, we can take the market, we can take it by force. As it is now, people want something mildly stronger than what is on the streets right now. Mildly stronger? Yes. It should be stronger, but at the same time, not too extreme for the consumers. You know, let me give you a scenario. Something that makes you... not feel high but at the same time you're not normal. You know, and you're like neither here nor there. I want to get there, you take it again, you're not really feeling high. But you're not normal, but you need to get there, because the destination is the highness, so you take it more. Before you know it, you're getting hooked and getting hooked and then you start using it like your life depends on it. [CHUCKLES] Good thing is... we have the formula. What we need are the materials. And that is where you come in. So, what materials do you need? Syrup, in large quantity. Abu, the supply is your own investment. If we can get unlimited supply of syrup and pills... I have the boys, I have the network to push it. And boom! Cash flows. We're going to make a whole lot of money, Abu, that even these coke dealers would be asking us what we did. They could even say we used people's heads, but you know, once you make money you're a ritualist. - Impressive. - Very impressive, Abu. Okay, let's say I want to do this business, what's my ROI? Return on investment is easy, Abu, it's what you put in that you get out, everybody knows. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [NIMBE] Yeah, who is that? Come in. Nimbeast, you're better than all of them, what's good bro? - How are you? - I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool... Yeah! I can see you are busy. Um, not really.

Hope you are good. Yes, I am. You don't often come to this area anytime you are down here in the west. - Uh... - [CHUCKLES] You are right, my brother. I need a trusted truck driver that could move stuff for me. What kind of stuff are we looking at? Stuff you don't want the authority to know about. [BOTH LAUGH] Hmm... I think I may know someone. His charges may be on the high side though. If you trust him, money won't be an issue. Okay. Give me a few minutes. We would go see him now. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Peju, you have a visitor. Baby, baby! [CHUCKLES] How far? I got your message. You've gone to check out that place right? [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] Sure. The house is wonderful, I swear. I really like it. We'll have privacy there too. No one can poke nose into our business. Anyway, have you gone to see the house agent, you've paid 150k right? Yes, I told you. It's remaining 50k to balance up. I have it here for you. - There you go. - My baby, sweetie. [CHUCKLES] That's right, queen of my heart. Let me run along to pay the rent. Alright, please do. I'll call you. Abu I must say, this your contact is very efficient. Yes, he is. I paid him good money to get these. - I can see that. - [BOTH LAUGH] You know, you should hook us up. I mean, introduce him to me. Uh-uh-uh, you know I can't. I know, I understand, security reasons, right? Well, as long as he continues to deliver, I don't have a problem. Yeah, as long as you honor our agreement, that won't be a problem. Abu, I'm a man of my words. - [CHUCKLES] - Boss! Are we ready? Yes, boss! Oh, so, when do we start production? Right away, boss! Our first batch hits the streets next week. - Hm. - All things being equal. What could be unequal? My truck leaves for Kano this weekend, I need some production. Abu, nothing is unequal. [AK] We hit the streets next week. We need to start making some cool cash. Abu, I've told you I will make you a very rich man, richer than you already are. [LAUGHS] [LIGHT SWITCHES] [PEJU] Good Evening. Where are you coming from? Uh... Um, shop. Peju. [SPLUTTERING] Customers, at the shop. We had a lot to do...

[SIGHS SHARPLY] I'm going to find out who he is and I will deal with him appropriately when the time is right. You don't need any boy in your life right now, girl. What you need in your life is to concentrate at work and learn very well. Why do you think I do all I do for you? For you to be a better person in future, that's why. Be careful. Be very, very careful, Peju. And this is the last time you'll ever return to this house this late. Do you understand me? Yes. Take. [SPLUTTERING] AK, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. You said you needed a new phone right? Yes. Take. Wow! So, what do you say to a man that just got you a phone? Thank you. You're the best brother in the world. Peju, please. [AK] Don't disappoint me.

But, Lemon, I love you. You know I love you. Then show me! Show me! We've been dating for two years now and I haven't entered the promise land. Patience, Lemon, patience. I have told you this before.

Oluwanimbe. Please... go and get me small bottle of gin before going out. I've told you we're getting late for church, he can't go to buy anything. What you are doing doesn't make sense, you keep asking him to buy alcoholic drinks. This boy is too young for that. Nimbe, pick up your bible, let's go to church we are getting late. Are you insinuating that I cannot send him on an errand again? I didn't say that. But we are going to church, pick up your bible and let's go. So what I'm saying is not making sense to you, Uduak? I'm sorry, but I meant generally. Is that what is being taught in your church, that you should tell your son not to listen to his father again? Right, no problem, as for me in this house. - Hello, Nimbe, you are not going anywhere. - Huh? You are not going to any church today, this house is your church today, final! What kind of a person are you? You want to start your problems this morning? Everyone is going to church to pray to God for favor. You will sit at home and be drinking all day, and later you will be calling me bad luck. [UDUAK] Who is the bad luck between the both of us? - Aren't you bad luck? - Who is bad luck between both of us? - Pick up your bible and let's go. - So indirectly, are you crazy? You're telling me my life is ruined? I didn't say so. You're telling me my life Is ruined, isn't that what you're saying? - I didn't say so. - Hello? Go back there, go and remove your... Stand there, where are you going to? Hey, Uduak, Uduak! - I know you will die soon. - I'm not going to die. But if you want to die, die alone. I will not die. Don't let your son to die with you, I will kill you and your son. Go and take off your clothes. [UDUAK] He's not going anywhere. - He's not going anywhere? - Yes. This one is... See, see, see. If I'm talking, you should keep quiet. Are you crazy? So you mean, I can't send my son on errands anymore? [BAYO] You're too rude. If you don't leave my shirt, kill me. - If I count to two... - Anywhere you wanted! If you don't leave my shirt, if I count to two. - Count it! - I will give you a dirty punch. Count it! I will give you a dirty punch. One... [BAYO] But if you want to die, die alone. [UDUAK] I will not die. [BAYO] Don't let your son to die with you, I will kill you and your son. Go and take off your clothes. [UDUAK] He's not going anywhere. [SOMBER MUSIC] [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] Baba Nimbe, you didn't even ask me about the preparations for my sister's wedding? They called asking us to contribute money again but I have told them that I will send my portion next week. I have told them. That's how... Excuse me. [UDUAK] My sister called me that she would be coming from Calabar next weekend. So I said, "Thank God she mentioned it early." Because if she didn't and I mention it to "Baba Nimbe", he will ask why I didn't tell him. But thank God, I have told you now that she's coming next weekend. Do you still have a mirror in your room? That's the mirror I use to dress up and look pretty. Do you stand in front of the mirror? Am I supposed to stand behind it? And that mirror doesn't advise you? That what again? Don't you have a brain at all, don't you think? You cooked food, the food tastes like wood someone cannot eat it. Imagine, how will a mad person cook food and it won't be sweet? A mad person cooked for a fellow mad person. [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] You see, two mad people are eating the same food, why won't it be sweet to them? Is this food? Tell me! I don't understand why you say such things. Because the only I said now was to remind you about my sister's wedding. I don't understand why you are saying all these? Everything about your life Papa Nimbe, is sadness. The little house we are supposed to live in love, peace and unity. You will be squeezing your face all the time, especially with the fact that you're not even handsome. You now make matters worse by squeezing your face. These things break my heart. So, I'm talking like a brainless person? You're in the best position to know what's wrong with you. So, if you say you're talking like a brainless person, you're on the right track. - I will slap... - Do you want to injure me? [SPLUTTERING] I will slap you... Stop there, are you sick? [BAYO] Where are you going? So you now have the effrontery to walk out on me. Are you sick? [SUCKS TEETH] [EXCLAIMS] What happened? Why did you hiss? Is it raining? Why did you hiss, what kind of thing is this? He hissed at me? No! He did not hiss at you. It was me he hissed at. Hiss that felt like he hit me. No, I was the one he hissed at. Holy Shaolin Temple! Your son has turned to a ninja. Jackie Chan. [YELLING] You are crazy. - So... - He hissed at me. - Good morning, mom. - Good Morning, come here. Where did you come from? [UDUAK] Where did you sleep? I'm talking to you. I said, where are you coming from? Where did you sleep? - [STAMMERS] - You what? - [SLAMS DOOR] - Nimbe! I'm dead. Nimbe! I'm talking to you and you're locking the door. [UDUAK] Open this door now! Open this door before I break it. Open this door! Hmm. You don't want to open the door, I don't know the devil that has possessed you. It will be resolved when I get back from the shop. We will both die there today. Nimbe! Nimbe! I was asking you where you slept and where you were coming from but you're acting deaf, right? No problem. Nimbe! Your money is at the usual place. Don't be late to school, open this door. Take the money and go to school on time. Nimbe, this door is still locked? It's still locked? Don't be late for school. [BLABBERING] No problem. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Who is that? Come in. [RALPH] It's me, Ralph. Hey, guy, what's up? - How are you doing? - Oh, I'm good! - How are you? - I'm cool, man. No school today? No! It's my day off. Day off? [CHUCKLES] So, I was trying to get your number. Then I remembered you don't even have a phone. In this century? Guy! Ralph, this is my lunch, didn't you eat at home before leaving? You should get one. And where will I get the money to buy one? Guy, I know where we can get the money. [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] You want two, right? [NAIRA] Yes, Ma. - Four hundred, Naira. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you! - Please patronize us again. Uduak, what's wrong? It's my son that's troubling me. What happened to Nimbe? [MUMBLES] There's something wrong with that boy, that's not my son anymore. I've noticed that he has changed. He doesn't talk to me like he used to anymore. Something happened some days ago between him and his father. He hissed at his father, he even stood firm and faced his father. I was talking to him, he walked out on me. Something is not right, there is something fishy. Don't be scared, you're a mother. What you need to do is to commit him unto God's hands. And back him up with prayers, because you can't follow him everywhere he goes. Guy, let's go, let's go. Ralph, where did you get that money from? What money? Baba, let's go. Ralph, this boy looks like you. Guy, let's go please. Come on! Are you mad? [NIMBE] I still can't believe you stole from your parents. So, what will they do if they find out? That's if they find out. [RALPH] And they won't. Besides, I only took, not steal. But wait, your parents are very rich, and they give you money like you said. - [RALPH] Mm-hm. - So, why this life? Attention, love, loneliness and boredom. You see, my dad is never around. The few times he is, it's just... - Hey, baby, how are you? - Hello, Daddy. How are you? Fine. Daddy, are you travelling again? Oh, yes. You know, daddy need to go to work, okay? But this time, I won't stay long, okay? Um, I didn't know you were back, sir. Oh, I came back very late. You were already sleeping. Um, can I talk to you, sir? Oh, come on, you can see I am very busy now. I need to sort this out for my Abuja trip and presentation tomorrow, okay. Come on, don't give me that look. You know what? Go into my room. Check the drawer there, you will see some notes. Pick some, just go buy yourself something. Dad, that's... Come on, just go. Buy yourself some things. Make yourself happy, all right? Go, go. And your mom? My mom? Well, she has her own business going on as well. She's always yapping about building herself and all that. But, I saw two girls in the photo. Oh yeah, those are my sisters. Mariam, my kid sister, she's in school, and Olivia. Olivia is studying in Canada, I will join her after my WAEC. Oh, wait, are you supposed to be in school? Well, not really. Just... I just need to get my WAEC results. I have paid for special center and all that. - Special Center? - Yeah. What's that? Special Centers, you don't need to read to pass, you just pay, and they give you the answers to the questions straight up. - Really? - Yeah! So, there's such a thing like that? Yeah! So, why am I even in school? - Exactly! - [NIMBE CHUCKLES] Hey, man. Don't forget, bro. Don't forget who bought you your first phone, man. You owe me. [LAUGHS] I can never forget, thanks, Ralph. That's cool, bro. Don't mention. Let's take a selfie, this is how it works, I've gotten it. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Ralph, those girls are pretty. They're AK's. That guy is Wolf. [RALPH] Wolf is the one that gets the babes for the boss. Have you ever entered that office before? [RALPH] Not at all. It's not that easy to enter "Paradise". Joseph Anthony. [TEACHER] Ikotun Blessing. Adegoke Toheeb. Oluwanimbe Oguntade. [TEACHER SIGHS] Oke Bayo John. [BELL RINGS] Alright your assignments tomorrow, no excuses this time. I will be expecting it, that's all for today. Nimbe, wait behind, I'd like to see you. [TEACHER] What was your score in this last test? I had six, ma. Hmm! You had six over 15? And that is like the best so far in your continuous assessment. [TEACHER] God! Is anything the problem? Is it something you want to talk to me about? Any problems in the house, at home, academics? No, ma. Hmm, well if you continue this way, I will be forced to tell you to come to school with one of your parents. - Ma? - Yes. No, ma. Please, ma. Don't, ma. I promise I will improve in my tests and assignments, ma. Please don't involve my parents in this, please. [SIGHS SHARPLY] This is the most important class of your senior year. [TEACHER] You will be writing WAEC next year, I hope you know? With performances like this, you won't make it into the university. You need to sit up and get back to doing your best like the Nimbe we used to know. Can you do that? Yes, ma, I promise, I will. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHEERING] [IN YORUBA] Hello, bring down the volume. Thank you! Boss! Boss!

Fine boy, you and Ginja are here, on my birthday. You guys didn't get me any gift. Boss, don't worry, what is a birthday gift? We have given you more than birthday gift, our lives, we are willing to die for you. Fine boy, what do you say? Anywhere you go, we will go with you. So we die there right? But not today. Because "oyinbo say" we die yesterday, so we can live today. Wow! It looks just like you. It doesn't look like me, this is me. - [LAUGHS] - Turn it around. Boss, this is very beautiful.

Congratulations, bro. But may I not be bothered by such tales, please? Is everything okay? Did I complain to you? No, but I thought... You thought me... You just thought what, Nimbe? [PEJU SIGHS SHARPLY] Hey, dear. [LEMON IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] I thought you were coming right behind me, where did you stop over? Don't be upset. It's your people that delayed me. [PEJU] You know it's my brother's birthday, and I had a lot of stuff to do. Come here. [LEMON] Where are you now going? Home, of course. I just thought to bring some food and drinks for you. Relax now. AK is still having fun, we can still spend some time together. Hmm! Are sure? [SCOFFS] Of course. Hm... So, how are you? I'm fine. [IN PIDGIN] Please, what is going on here? Now, look at what you're doing. I already told you, I am not ready for this. Peju, Peju, Peju, please, I have been very patient with you, what's the matter. Do I look like a stone? - Hmm. - [SCOFFS] Okay, if my presence is annoying and we'll keep arguing like this, let me start going to my house. What is it? Calm down, can't someone joke with you anymore? Chill, do you care for a drink? Yeah! I need to take a leak, I'll be back. No problem. [DOOR OPENS] [TOILET FLUSHING] Baby...

Now talk to me, I can hear you. Okay, I have been thinking about this, I think I know what to tell my brother for him to accept us. Please, please, I have told you before. Peju, it can't work, AK doesn't listen to stories. But he's my brother. You know, he would want the best for me. Peju, please see. He wants the best for me, and if he knows I am happy with you, he'll come around. Peju please don't tow that line please just let it die. - Huh? - Okay. [SIGHS] - Do you have a new neighbor? - I didn't hear that. I can hear music, like... like an orchestra. What's wrong? Music in mass. It must be the stress from your brother's party, all the organizing you had done at the party. Lie down and rest. Lie down, lie down, lie down. - Lie down, lie down. - [SIGHS SHARPLY] Like a lot of music. I know what I'm hearing actually. I'm not arguing with you, lie down. [LEMON] Peju, I'm begging you.

[CRYING] I'm sorry, please. I'm sorry, please. I'm begging you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please. - [SOBS] - Don't cry. Before, it was codeine, tramadol or rephinol. But when they couldn't get high, they got creative. And start sniffing latrine pits, dry pawpaw leaves. But now, both old, young, married women, married men, they all go for SLAK. Abu, say that again. Everybody needs SLAK. - [BOTH LAUGH] - How does it make them feel? - It goes... - It goes like this. [BOTH SNIFF] [BOTH] One... Two, and they go boom! [LAUGHS] Look Abu, I...

[LAUGHS] Abu, I told you as a partner, let us cut them some SLAK. Yes, AK. I guess this is a very good time to be alive. - It is indeed. - Yes. Ooh, the money is coming. - I'm telling you. - Excuse me. - Yeah? - Who is that boy in your car? [AK] Ah, that? Uh... His name is Nimbe. He's my protégé, he's very creative. He's very good with fine arts. He's... He draws all these very good stuffs, he made a picture of me on my birthday - and I just liked him. So... - Oh, really? Yes. I've been thinking of what to do with him. Then send him to the US, you can sponsor him, you have all the money now, you have all the money to spend on him. I'm still looking for some SLAK. [LAUGHTER] We're giving them the SLAK. - Yeah. - And it goes, one, two, and they go... [BOTH] Boom! [LAUGHING] Hi bro, I thought I'd find you here. I got gist for you. What do you want Nimbe? What is it? Bro, guess... Don't you bro me, man. Don't you dare bro me. You are a traitor and a cheat. You are the dumbest idiot alive. Coward! Don't call me a coward. Coward! That is what you are. Or you want to fight me? Ralph, I would never fight you. No matter what you do. Nimbe the Coward! The only power you have is to be stalking Peju and drawing her pictures. I don't know what it is you have going on in your head, but whatever it is, I hope you figure it out. Damn you! You know what, fuck you! Nimbe. Nimbe. [NIMBE] Ma! [DOOR CLOSES] Ma! [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] Here is your feeding allowance. Thanks, mom. Are you sure you are alright? - Yes, ma. - Are you sure you don't want anything? No, Mom. I am going to the shop now, when I'm gone, make sure you lock the doors very well. Yes, Mom. And make sure you go to school in time so that you're not late. Yes, mom, is that all? I need to get something. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SLAMS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Lock the doors very well. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR SLAMS] [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] AK, what did I do to you? Tell me what did I do to you? Everyone gather here. What have I done to you that makes you want to spoil my life? What have I done to you that makes you want to spoil my life? [CRIES] - I'm begging you forgive me. - Auntie Uduak, what are you talking about? The last time I saw you was so many years ago. And that was when you stopped coming to plait Peju's hair. Who are you telling that to? You know how you always protect your sister, but you want to ruin my son's life. Why do you want to ruin my son's life? - Your son? - Yes, my son! Nimbe is my son. Oh! What do you want me to tell his father? That the boy comes here instead of going to school? I swear I did not know Nimbe was your son. I am begging you in God's name, please give me my son, let me go. - Calm down. - [BLABBERING] Calm, calm... Please, calm down. - [UDUAK] I will die here. - Aunty Uduak. Aunty Uduak. Aunty Uduak, get up, please. Get up. Get up. -Please give me my son, -Get up, get up. Don't worry, go home. - I want to take my son with me now. - Go home. Your son will meet you at home. [YELLING] If you don't bring my child, AK. - It's okay. - You didn't even think about how much I have suffered. He's my only child, if you don't bring him I will kill myself, I will kill myself. [YELLING] Boss, who is that woman? Go get me Nimbe. It's because you have now gained access to Paradise. You're starting to lose your senses. You now disobey your parents, right? Don't you know that the white men said, "Parental Guidance is what, is a manufacturing agency". I will slap you, you will start menstruating. [AK] When the good Lord was creating mothers, it was his 6th day of his overtime, and suddenly "pop", an angel appeared, and she said, "God, you've been fiddling around this for so long". And God said, "Have you even read the specs on this order?" She has to be completely washable, but not plastic. One hundred and eighty moveable parts. All replaceable. [AK] Thighs that disappear when she stands. A kiss that can heal almost anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair "and six pairs of hands." [LAUGHING] Oh, God, you're funny. [LAUGHING] "Oh, God, you got me on that one", the angel said. [LAUGHING] Six pairs of hands, nah! No way. But the good Lord replied her, He said, "Yes, yes", but it's not the six pairs of hands that are causing me so much trouble. It is the three pairs of eyes. One right here, right here that can see through closed doors and ask, "What are my kids doing?" One pair of eyes back here. On this spot, to see what she shouldn't... but what she has to see. And one more pair of eyes here in front. To look at her child and say, "Oh, I understand..." And I forgive you. And I love you with every breath that I take "all without uttering a word." Excuse me, God. Hold up! Wait a minute, God. [GIGGLES] The angel said, God, this is so much for you. I think you need to rest. But, "No, no, no! I cannot rest, I will not rest." Said the good Lord. For I am so close, I am this close. Creating something unique. Something so near perfection. Something close to me. The angel was taken aback. And then she looked at the woman. And touched her cheek, from top. Oh! Something's not right. There's a leak, she pronounced. God, there is a leak. Oh! You're causing your mother a whole lot of pain, disappointment and sadness. I want you to go back home and apologize to your mother. Tell her you're sorry, tell her everything you have done will never repeat itself. Promise her you'll be a good boy from today, do you understand? Yeah. Why do you think my sister Peju means the world to me? [AK] She's a representation of my mother. She's family, and family is everything. [UDUAK] You don't even consider how much I have suffered for you. What do I have? Is this how all my mates are? What do I have? And I have suffered a lot for you. How could you do this to me? I now see you with boys who don't have a bright future. Nimbe, you broke my heart. - [CRYING] - Mommy, I'm really, really sorry. Please. I promise to be good, henceforth. I also promise that I'll return to school from tomorrow. Mommy, please stop crying now, please. See, I don't want you to beg me. I'm your mother, I don't need you to beg me. What I want is for you to stop going to that place. I don't want you doing that thing anymore. That thing kills people. You're the only hope I have. You're the one I'm living for. Do you want people to make jest of me because of you? No. Do you want my enemies to make jest of me? No. But they're starting to laugh at me. You broke my heart and I am really hurt. I've suffered a lot. I don't have anything, you're all I'm depending on. If anything were to happen to you, my life will be ruined. - Mommy, I'm sorry, please. - [BLABBERS] [BOTH CRYING] Uduak! [GROANS] Uduak! [UDUAK] Yes? Okay! What's the matter? Why are you shouting like this and scattering the whole house? Don't worry about that. Where are my blue jeans, the one I like to wear to work? So it's because of... [BAYO] Where's my blue jeans? Please go and sit down. Is it because of blue jeans, that you turned the whole house upside-down? Like you've been fighting with someone. If someone doesn't do you favors, you will complain. I have washed them. What? - Huh? - What's wrong? - You did what? - I washed them with the other clothes. I've said I was going to fight you. You packed all your jeans and so many dirty clothes was put there. Like I'm your house helper. I have washed them, they are on the line in the backyard. You washed what? Don't I wash your clothes normally? Hey! You washed them? Yes, I did of course. What sort of person is this? I'm still going to fight to death in this house today. Hey! My life is ruined. My life is ruined. [GROANING] This woman has ruined my life. This woman has ruined my life. [GROANING] [SCREAMS] Uduak has ruined my life. Hey! - [BAYO] Uduak! - What? - Hey! - What? Uduak, I will kill you in this house. - Ah! - You have ruined my life! I knew you had bad luck - I will kill you in this house finally. - What's wrong? Oh, my God! You didn't pity me at all, God. Oh, my life! See, 1.5-million-naira ticket, you washed it away. I didn't know there was 1.5 million in the pocket. I beg you in God's name, please don't be angry. I'm going to die today. See, Uduak, I am boiling right now, and I don't want to kill anybody. Please go inside, pack your things and leave this house, now! I don't... What... Pack my things? Uduak! - Where do you expect me to go? - Uduak! Where do you expect me to go? Uduak, wait! Where do you expect me to go? I beg of you in the name of God. [OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE] Where do you expect me to go? What did I do? I beg of you in the name of God. This is the work of the devil. Uduak, you know that I can do anything. I know. You and your child, you both have bad luck. Pack your things and leave. I beg of you in the name of God, I don't have anyone, you're the only one I have. Wait for me, you see this crying? This is just a rehearsal. I'll make you perform live and direct. Okay? You will use the main stage and have an orchestra. People will applaud you when you're about to die. Ah! Wait for me. Wait. I haven't done anything wrong, I only washed his clothes. [BAYO] You must be mad! Go out! Get out! God will punish you! Go! May God punish you. [COUGHS] I'm still begging you in God's name. I didn't do anything. [BAYO] Before the count of 15, if you don't leave this house, you're done. Well... - One... - [BLABBERS] - Two... - [MUMBLES] Three... Four, five, six, seven... - I'm done packing up. - Eight, nine, ten! What sort of thing is this? Sorry. Drink some water to calm you down. I don't understand why he will chase you out of the house because of bet money. How much is the money, by the way? It's because of common 1.5 million naira that my husband chased me out of the house. One point what? - 1.5 million. - [EXCLAIMS] It's a lot of money. But that doesn't warrant him kicking you out of the house. My husband even called me bad luck, he said I'm bad luck. Uduak, don't worry about that rubbish he's saying. You and I know that you're not bad luck. See, he's very upset right now. After some time, he will calm down. This is my home, and you're welcome to stay here. I don't want you worrying yourself. [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] [RALPH] Who's there? [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] I'm coming. What do you want, guy? Hi, Ralph. So, my dad chased my mom and I out of the house. And I have nowhere else to go. So, I was wondering if I could chill with you for a bit. [SUCKS TEETH] [SLAMS DOOR] [SOMBER MUSIC] [SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] - Hey, go back. - Ah, please. Hey, you think you're smart. [SOBS] You now have guts, right? AK, please. Please, AK. Please, AK. AK... AK... [GINJA] So, you are the one? Please have mercy. AK, it was a mistake, please have mercy. It's only God that shows mercy. He wants mercy. Am I God? I'm not God. If you want mercy, you go to God. That's what you do. Nimbe, come, come, come. Hey. [SCREAMING] Hey, hey, hey. [SHUSHES] [MUMBLES] Are you crazy? [GINJA] Are you scared of dying? Are you scared of dying? Shh! ♪ Row, row, row your boat Gently down the sea ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but... ♪ A... A what? ♪ A dream ♪ - [AK] You have to aim. You have to aim. - [WHIMPERING] Now, you point it. [AK] Now aim, look at the... Above the head. Yeah, oh, shit... She's giving you something. She wants something. She wants to come out. Feel it! Feel her! She wants you to squeeze her. Squeeze her! [GUNSHOT] Aha! Easy. [AK LAUGHS] Yeah. Delilah... [AK CHUCKLES] So, just like that, Delilah has made you... [TRAFFIC NOISE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So, it's the same guys, right? It's the same crew eliminating all our informants one at a time, sir. [GROANS] Enough is enough, Johnson. I want these guys brought to book. See, at this point, I don't care what you do. I just want AK and his hooligans put behind bars, once and for all. - Have I made myself clear? - Yes, sir! Call an ambulance and pack this body.

You can't tell me you don't know how this happened. Look, I don't want to get judgmental, but... you could have at least asked him to use a condom. If only he had used a condom, you won't be in this situation right now. Mira, I swear I just woke up the next morning and saw blood. Wait, what? He had sex with you without your consent? [MIRA] Oh, my God! That is rape! He raped you! Look, you will have to tell this to AK. AK needs to know this. No! Lemon is my boyfriend. It's not rape. Look, look. When someone has sex with you without your consent, it is described as rape! That guy... That guy is such a bastard. How are you still defending this boy? Can you stop, Mira? Can you stop? He apologized later. And besides, I still love him. And please, don't go telling anyone. Please! Okay. I'm not going to say this to anybody. But what are you going to do now? Mira, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do, Mira. Relax, babe. Relax! Have you told the rapist? He is not a rapist. He is not a rapist! And I haven't told him yet. How? Why not? At least he needs to know he is in this. And he has to report himself to AK because you can't allow this boy just go around town acting like nothing is happening and you are going through all this on your own. [LEMON] Since when? I didn't see my period last month. Nothing this month too. [GROANS] [LEMON] But it could be something else. It could be, um... What's it called again? Lemon, I'm pregnant! [GROANS] I am so dead. AK is going to kill me. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE, GROANS] AK will kill me slowly. You see, I will talk to him. What? And say what? Except you want this child to grow up without a father. I beg you. Please! What are we going to do now? [SIGHS] Shit! [WORRIED] Peju... you know I love you. You know I love you so much. But with the current situation of things, we can't keep this, baby. [LEMON] Please, I'm begging you. This is not the right time. We'll just terminate it. [LEMON MUMBLES] Oh, shit. Peju, please, I'm begging you. Please, Please! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [NIMBE SIGHS] Peju, what happened? Are you okay? Mira. Please, sit down. Oh my God, she's bleeding. Mira, what happened to her? Peju, Peju, Peju, talk to me. Talk to me. Where are you both coming from? Peju! Mira, talk to me, what's going on? I think she had an abortion. What? Lemon drugged and raped her. - [SOBS] - Lemon? That bastard! AK, there's a problem. Peju is not feeling well. Her friend said she had an abortion. [AK] What? Peju? Yes, she said Lemon drugged and raped her. AK, Peju is bleeding. - I don't know what to do. - Call a taxi, take her straight to the hospital, I will be on my way. Okay. Okay, boss. Peju! Peju, talk to me. - Peju! Peju! - [GASPING] Peju, listen, listen! We have to take her to the hospital right now. - Pick her up. Pick her up. Pick her up. - Come on. Peju, Peju, Peju! Hey, Peju. Look... Look at me. Peju! Peju! Hey, hey, hey, Peju. - [CRYING] - No. Peju! [SHUSHES] She's fine! She's going to be fine. - [BLABBERS] - Peju! Peju! Peju... [INAUDIBLE] [SOMBER MUSIC] [BANGING ON DOOR] [DOOR OPENS] [THWACKS] [GROANS] - [GINJA] Stop it. - Leave me. - Hey! - Leave me! Hey! Nimbe, calm down, what's wrong with you? What's your problem? Huh? [NIMBE BREATHING HEAVILY] [LEMON] Fuck... I'm begging you, AK. Please, AK, please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Oh, please. Oh, please. Please. [LEMON WHIMPERS] I'm finished. Ah! Please! [GROANING] [WHIMPERS] [GASPS] [MUMBLING] AK, AK, thank you! [GUNSHOT] [SOBBING] [SOMBER MUSIC] [SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [UDUAK] Who is that? Please chill. You'll just be knocking the door like... What's the problem? Hm? Hmm... [BAYO] I'm so sorry. It's just that I was not happy. The money we were supposed to use to start our lives afresh. Just gone like that. 1.5 million naira. It hurt me a lot. [IN YORUBA] Deep into my bones. Are you sure you will not repeat such again? Are you sure of what you're saying? Uduak, if anyone told you I could come here to beg you. Would you believe it? If I was going to do such again, I wouldn't have come here. [BAYO] Please. Please, forgive me. Please. I beg you. Now look at your son, he can't even have a father to son discussion with you. He doesn't feel any fatherly love from you. Everything we do gets you angry. You never appreciate anything we do. It's not fair. Put yourself in our shoes. It's very, very bad. It's an eyesore. Ask anyone. It's not done anywhere. Where is Nimbe? He is with his friends. [BAYO] Are you sure Nimbe is here? Are you sure my son is here? Bayo, you know we have agreed that you won't shout when we get here. I'm reminding you again. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Nimbe! Nimbe! Nimbe! Where is Nimbe? - Nimbe! Nimbe! - Nimbe! Where is Nimbe! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Nimbe, Nimbe! Nimbe! Uduak! When did Nimbe start coming here? And hanging with these bad guys? When was it? How come? When? Nimbe. You are smoking. I am ashamed of you. Upon all the money I spent on you to get an education? You wasted it all here. You are a disappointment. - You are a... - Enough! Don't you dare call me a disappointment. You are the disappointment. [SPLUTTERING] Are you okay? - [NIMBE] No. - Shut your mouth! No, mom, I am not keeping quiet. In fact, I am done keeping quiet. Don't you know that's your father? Let me tell him how he has failed as a father. [NIMBE] And yes, I know who I am talking to. What have you done for me? To make you think you can come in here and claim me. What? [IN PIDGIN ENGLISH] You're going crazy. You know what? I don't have time to talk to you. Papa Nimbe, don't be offended. We will settle it all at home. You have also broken my heart before. So, we will settle it as a family. You know what? It's time to go home. If you don't answer, I will lose my temper and go stark naked here. Let us go home. I'm sorry, mom. But this... is home now. - [NIMBE PANTING] - [MOUTHING] Nimbe! [ALL CHEERING] Benji, say sorry. Or what? Get out, you Nimbecile! [STUDENTS LAUGH] [LAUGHING CONTINUES] [GUN COCKS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] [STUDENTS CLAMORING] [NIMBE] Like I said, this wasn't me. But this is who I have become. And yes, I would confess it and I do not feel any shame. Not today. Everyone has been taken away, one way or the other. They said SLAK and some other substances are causing trouble in the society. So, the authorities arrested AK and the gang and locked them up. Ginja won a bet and disappeared. I miss Ralph. He was a brother I never had. Showed me love like no other. But... Ralph is not well now. They say he has liver problem. Because of the stuff he was taking. I really hope he survives it. [SOMBER MUSIC] I hope my parents are happy now. As for me, I am on the other side. I am not sure there's a way back. This is who I am now. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] [SOMBER MUSIC]
