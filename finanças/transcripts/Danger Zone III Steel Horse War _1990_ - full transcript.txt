FATHER: Jonathan, you doing that homework? I'm doing it. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. NARRATOR: When Wade Olsen's girlfriend, Donna, was shot by the nefarious biker lord men called the Reaper, he thought she would pull through. But when she died on the operating room table, a part of Wayne Olsen died with her. Some men say the best part. Now he rides alone, tormented, a solitary figure of justice. One civilized man adrift in the danger zone. [MUSIC PLAYING] Reaper, what kind of name is that? You know, Wyman, like Death. The Reaper, like Grim. That so? You the Grim Reaper, boy? Killed his cellmate two days before the poor son of a bitch got his parole. Sounds like a fucking animal to me. Heard the guy had a fortune hid on the outside. You hear about that Reaper? Hell, we could stop and pick it up for you, Reaper. [LAUGHING] How's your brother holding up? Ah, he's getting over it. Course, she got the house and the kids. She got the gold mine and he got the shaft. He still seeing that Mary? He finally figured out what a tramp she was. Hell, after we dump this garbage maybe we ought to stop by and see her. Bet you had some little punk smoking your pipe in the joint, huh Reaper? County crew ahead. Ah, shit. Probably working on the damn highway again. Morning, boys. WYMAN: What's up? They had a quake out here last night. Fault line runs right under the highway up the road here. WYMAN: Jesus. We got a six inch crack right through the blacktop. What you have to do is take this side road here for about a mile and a half, you'll be all right. WYMAN: Thanks. Who you got back there? WYMAN: The Grim Reaper. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You know those county sons of bitches start at $27,000? Ah, wouldn't want their job. Bull shit. All they do is fix shit. We gotta catch it and haul it around. [LAUGHING] He's talking about you, Reaper. Why would a federal prosecutor call you in to testify anyway? I needed a vacation. Look at this. Jesus. Look at his leg. Call it in. This is transport unit 47 to base. Transport 47, come in base. I can't get through these hills. I think he's still alive. I'm going to check it out. I don't like this Don't like it. Shit. Get back in the car. Wyman. Shit. Get back in the car you idiot. [GUNS FIRING] Son of a bitch. Thanks for reviving me, ese. [GUN FIRING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN FIRING] Desert's been dead without you, man. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE], Reaper. Now we're even. Let him die, man. Let him die slow. Don't. What do you think I am? Some kind of animal? [GUN FIRING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me. Hey. This is a crime scene. Hey, dickhead. You can't be here. There is a police line around the whole area. I don't see one. Well, it's what you call figurative. I'm waiting for the evidence team. You can't be here. You can't be here! Understand? Hey, relax, man. I'm a cop. It doesn't matter if you are. You're not local, and you can't be here. What the hell are you doing? It's not blood. Theatrical makeup. See that grease? Got a bike on its side here. Yeah, so what? So they staged a fake action to get these two guys out of the car. Make sure they check that print real good. Hey, who are you? How'd you find out about this? Where are you going? I got a date with the devil. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) They'll make you sweat. They'll make you cry. They'll cut your spirit just before you die. They don't know right. They don't know wrong. Just grab you hard where the devil's on. They'll take your money. They'll break your pride. Don't try to run. Ain't no place to hide. Another storm is coming down. Saddle up. We're headed southbound. You don't wanna stare 'em straight in the eye. You don't even wanna try to pass 'em on by. A white lady has stolen all their senses. Now it's time to die. Said bad man riding, riding with the wind. Bringing in the storm from Mexico. Yeah, I said bad man riding, riding with the wind. Bringing in the storm from Mexico. That's the way it goes. Sit still. I was at my sister's wedding in Santa Barbara. And I met this really cute chick. We hit it off. You know, and I was thinking-- Come on, sit. Sit still. I was thinking, you know, now, there is a chick, man, that I could spend some time with. You know, my old lady wouldn't mind it. This chick was beautiful, man. We hit it off. Next thing I know, she starts talking about giving me head. And I said, hey, listen, just climb on the old chorizo, huh? You know, it could have been a really great relationship, something I really liked going for. But-- aw, man, Jesus, you're fucking me up, man! Ah, Jesus, man! Hey, Harlan. How are you doing, Harlan? I'm gonna ask you a few questions, all right? OK, man, all right. It all right if I ask a couple of questions? - Yes, man. - Where's Reaper at? Reaper? Who, man? Yeah, Reaper, Harlan, Reaper! OK, man. I-- I saw him in San Quentin two weeks ago. San Quentin, huh? - All right, all right! - Where's Reaper! All right! OK, man, I saw him just yesterday. Jesus! I saw him yesterday. Where? Where? Where did you see him? Man, do I look like a-- like a crystal ball or something? [SCREAMING] Fuck, man! Where's Reaper? He went back. He's in the desert somewhere. Jesus! Where in the desert? Where in the desert? Oh, man! You're fucking me up, man! Where in the desert? I think the first stop was gonna be at some White Power camp in Quantrill. I swear to God. I don't-- I swear to God I don't know anything else. I don't have a loyalty to that son of a bitch. I got a wife and kids too. I got a job. I got a studio. You're official effects makeup artist, aren't you, Harlan? Yeah, man, how did you know? Because you're dirty in this reaper thing, man. And they're checking your prints at the station right now. Motherfucker! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [RADIO CHATTER] Hey, I'm riding back to town. Why? Come on, Reaper. This is bullshit. We've already ridden over a hundred miles. You haven't told us where we're going. Hey, life isn't like this anymore. What about loyalty? Fuck loyalty! I got a job starting tomorrow. I think I speak for the rest when I-- Hey, speak for yourself, asshole. Yeah. Leave me the fuck out of your shit too. Yeah. No shit. You know what's wrong with you, Mongo? You're gutless. Like I said, gutless. Tomorrow, we leave for the Hopi mountains. Hopis? What for? The Hopis were spiritual visionaries. the Indian soil holds the key to our future. We ride at dawn. Far out. Hi. Hi. Roger? Oh, yeah, he's in the workshop. He's expecting you. Thanks. Hey. How you doing, Roger? Good, good. Who's the girl? My niece. Keeps trying to get me to retire. Why don't you? And do what? Watch football, get fat and die? As long as there are rich executives afraid of the dark, I'm in business. Hey, why don't you leave this to the force? They'll take care of it. As long as Reaper's involved, it's my business. Now, the best defense is a good offense. Try these. I made them for you. I already got shoes. Not like these. Simply put your foot down. The right heel, see. [CLICK] You've heard of steel-tipped shoes, haven't you? [CLICK] Here. Now, this is a very special gun. When the safety is on, it fires normally. But when the safety is off, it fires backwards. Straight at whoever pulls the trigger. Hey, here. These will come in handy. Explosives. How do they work? Well, you need this to go along with it. This little button here, it acts as a detonator. It's good for 300 feet. Hey, thanks, Rodge. This stuff ought to do me a lot of good. Hey. Thanks a lot, buddy. [CHUCKLING] Times are changing, Reaper. Hell, half the bikers are married, got kids. Riding free's a thing of the past, man. Here, maybe. America is lost to three piece suits, air surveillance, and 55 miles an hour. Where, then? Seems like there's no place left. Imagine a city of our own, a biker city, with me as king. And no laws except the laws of nature. Yeah, none of them wanna be righteous pigs. No helmet and all the drugs you want. Reap all day, fuck all night. I can dig it. Justice for bikers. A city built on gold. Hey Hey, that's my stuff in there, man. Hey, get out of there! Hey, all right. Go ahead and take it. I don't like that stuff anyway. Hey, boy. You got a little problem, huh? Yeah, let me take a look at it. Come on, let me see. Easy, boy. Easy, boy. Let me take a look at this. Come on. You gotta be still. I know it hurts. There it is. Let me get it. Be still. It's out now, boy. Looks like you owe me one, partner. Hey, boy. You better walk yourself out of here. You can walk now. Go on, make it. Split. Go on. [WHIMPERING] I'm riding alone on this. [BARKING] That's my bike. What bike is that? The bike your fat ass is sitting on. It's mine. Oh, this bike. Hey, this is a great bike. How much you want for it? It's not for sale. You see, the problem here is, Buford and me, we've been riding double. We don't wanna be riding double no more. So take a bus. [CHUCKLING] I got about 400 bucks. My final offer. I told you, man. The bike's not for sale. [CHUCKLING] Sure it is, cowboy. I'm gonna cut you good. Get him off! Get this mutt off of me! Get him off! Get him off! Get this mutt off of me! Come on. Ow! Aw, shit! Get him off. Come on. Get that thing going! Go, go. Go, go, go! [BARKING] Thanks, boy. Thanks, boy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. SONG: Bad man riding, riding with the wind. Bringing in the storm from Mexico. Yeah, I said, bad man riding, riding with the wind. Bringing in the storm from Mexico. Why don't you invite your friends out? Relax. We're all on the same side here. What side's that? The outside. Grayden, that's the Reaper, man. What's the Reaper? He used to be bad news. You know a biker named Catfish? He's somewhere between here and Hopi Land. We all know Catfish, man. He was through here about a week ago. I told you, I do the talking here! This mean anything to you? Nothing. What do you want from us? I'm looking for a fortune, and Catfish can help me find it. Anyone want a cut? We got everything we need here. We don't need you or your money. Well, you've got high ideals and a lot of balls. Might makes right. Why don't you just ride the fuck out of here, Reaper. That your final word? [GUNSHOT] So much for having balls. We can all die here right now, or you can ride with me and get rich. The man who finds Catfish first will be able to finance his own army. I thought you'd see it my way. Let's ride! You like that, huh? How about another one? I'm getting tired of these beans. You eat 'em up. I can't believe it, boss, a rainstorm out in the middle of the desert. Here, boy. Hey, here, boy. Rainmaker. So how'd you find me? Your energy's strong, easy to track. You see a dog around here? Yeah, he ran off as I rode up. He had business somewhere else. What brings you out here? RAINMAKER: I'm looking for work. My reputation isn't what it used to be. What's the matter? Losing your touch? The sky is different now. Yeah, it's full of pollution, even way out here. And little pieces of earth gone forever. Yeah, rainmaking is like fighting chemical warfare these days. You know, there's black sky all around you? Yeah, I know. I'm gonna try and blow that sky away. RAINMAKER: The Reaper, huh? When I first met you two years ago, you were pissed off. But your soul was clear. Now it's dark with fury. You sound like a fortune cookie. Just reading your cards, son. That's all. We got a lot of riding to do. Hello. Anybody here? Someone's here. But they're in pain. [GROANING] Good God. Ah, Reaper shot me. Hey, bud. Let me. It hurts. Reaper shot me. Quiet now, son. Now, breathe deeply with me. Come on. [BREATHING] The pain is going away. Yes. Where'd Reaper go? South, Ciudad del Spectro. Took a bunch of my skins, promised 'em big money. [COUGHING] You rest now. HORATIO: It's hot. OK, Come on now, girls. Girls, girls. Sex. Come on, Andy, give me a little sex. Thanks, Bridget. Great. Great. That's it, Angie. You're getting there. Sex, both of you. Pout a little bit. Great. Hey, girls, we're getting somewhere. OK, let's have a reload. Come on, Angie, pick it up a little bit, all right? [INAUDIBLE] How you guys doing? It's so hard for me to be sexy. Just think of Axel Rose. That's what works for me. He's disgusting! Have you seen Monica since she had her surgery? They cost her three grand. Well, they're great, though. Damn well better be for three grand. For three grand, they should take out the trash and do the dishes. [LAUGHTER] Oh, did you see the ones Michelle got? Oh, they're awful. They're not that bad. You could open bottle caps with those things. Oh, God. Well, that's all right, as long you rotate 'em every 50,000 miles. - At least. [LAUGHTER] OK, come on, girls. Let's go, back to work. Yes, sir, Master Horatio. [CHATTERING] Come on, guys. We're trying to get a job done. [LAUGHTER] I've seen those two guys before. Let's get them. You know what work is, don't you? You've heard the word, haven't you? "Work." These people are gonna need some help. MAN: Do we look like we work? Why don't you assholes hit the road? Come on, we're trying to focus. [LAUGHTER] Focus on this. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHTER] Come on. So who wants to be first, huh? Who wants to grease old Cupid's love pipe? Oh, no! [LAUGHTER] How about you, babe? Bet you'd be the sweetest thing I ever tasted, huh? How about a kiss? I said, kiss me, bitch. Kiss me, bitch! Hey! Didn't you boys wanna settle that fight? Hey, why don't you back off, motherfucker? Or the girls are history. I brought you boys something. Happy 4th of July. Check it, it's dynamite! Come on! What are you doing, man? Piece of cake. Ah, damn, I hate to waste a whole frigging road flare. Let's help you up there, [INAUDIBLE].. Rainmaker, come take a look at this. Oh, you'll be fine, son. It went clean through. And, girls, I need something to stop the bleeding. I don't have anything. Hey, that's-- that's thread there. That's fine. Come on, he's bleeding. Oh, yeah. these ought to do the job. [GROANING] This can't be all of it. What's the next move, Reaper? I wanna find Catfish. Take two men and comb the hills. Who the hell is that? That's Buford and Ira. Let's move out. Ah, Reaper, am I glad to see you. Ran into some trouble. What kind of trouble? Some big, blonde asshole. Olsen. Was he alone? He was the first time. Then he had that Rainmaker freak with him. Did he follow you? No, Reaper, I swear to God. Hey, come on, look. I swear to God. Pounder, take a couple of men, find Olsen and the white hair and stop 'em dead. Yeah, you got it. Pete, Dino. [GUNSHOTS] Reaper knows we're coming! [GUNSHOTS] Agh! OK, punk, I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Tell me the truth and you're outta here. You lie to me, and you stay here forever. You got it? Where's Reaper? South of the border. Where? Down in Mexico. - Where? - I don't know. What's he doing down there? I don't know, man. Come on! For Christ's sakes, dude, he's got a hundred men with him. I don't know. That's all I know. He went south. That's all I know. All right. Get outta here. Hey, dickhead! You wouldn't find Reaper in a hundred years! Hey, why'd you let him go? We're coming back for you and kick your fucking ass! And I'm with him! Liar, liar, pants on fire. [EXPLOSION] [SCREAMING] He said Reaper is south? We ride north. [CHATTERING] Here's Catfish, boss. Find it? Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. Skin. Reaper, look, don't be pissed off, OK? The money I took I invested. I screwed up, you know? Who cares? It was only 30 grand. After tomorrow, that'll be small change. I thought you were going straight. What are you doing riding with a piece of shit like this? He's a nice guy. I wasn't talking to you. [LAUGHTER] Search him, Tester. Strip search this one. I was hoping you'd say that. What do you want, Reaper? I'm your new business partner. [CHATTERING] [WHIPPING] I know you're lying to me, Catfish. You don't know shit. I know more than you think. I was Hangman's cellmate. I know you were gonna meet him here two days after his parole. [WHIPPING] That's today, asshole. I know you have the other part of the map. [WHIPPING] I know you think I won't really kill you. Fuck off! [WHIPPING] SKIN: Reaper, stop! Stop! [WHIPPING] I'll give you the map. Stop! Skin, don't! Promise me you won't hurt him. No! OK? Of course. Catfish honey, are you OK? Get away from me! Catfish, I just saved your life. You sold me out. What do you wanna do with the fish? Reaper. Reaper, you said you wouldn't hurt him. And I won't. Bastard! Son of a bitch! Let me down. Let me down. Shut her up. Let me down, you piece of shit! Come on, Catfish. I'll buy you a drink. We better split up tomorrow. We're near an old abandoned Navajo reservation. Reaper could be anywhere around here. Wade, I meant what I said before, about the blackness in your heart. You know, the more hate you give, the more you have to give. That sounds like a warning. Listen, the more hatred you direct at Reaper, the more hatred will come into your life. You put yourself in danger. And why do you wear that monkey? That's my aumakua. Auma what? Aumakua. You see, the Hawaiians believe that every person has a guardian that takes the shape of an animal. You know, like a shark or a bird or whatever. Mine happens to be a monkey. Well, if I had one, I guess it would be a mangy dog. Could be. Could be. There's an old mining camp near here. I'm gonna check it out in the morning. I want you to look around the foothills. [CHATTERING] What's yours is mine! Reaper, they never came back. Pounder and them. Yeah. Well, that's all right. Least they'll slow 'em down. Professor up yet? No, but he said he wanted to get an early start. You wanna help me with this flap? You take the hills. This could be dangerous. Yeah, so's crossing the street. You still hanging around? Catfish, I'm giving you a choice. Ride with me and take a share like everybody else, or I'll let you and the bitch go. Count me in. Catfish! Catfish, you prick! Fuck you, Reaper. Tried it, Skin. It wasn't worth the effort. Bastard! Son of a bitch! Catfish, come back here! Don't worry. Somebody will come and keep you company. A coyote, a mountain lion, maybe. You're just gonna leave her here, Reaper? She knows an awful lot about what we're doing. She's bait. Bastards! What's your secret? Man, this is history? I know. I thought it'd be all dusty books and old newspapers. You guys, don't worry about it. This could do more for our careers than anything after graduation. How? Are you kidding? If we find anything, the professor will prove his theory. So? So, dingle, then he writes his book and we all get credit. That's what. We'll be published before we even graduate. Wow, cool. Sometimes when I think about the Civil War, I can't even believe it. Hard to imagine slaves in America. WOMAN: It's not hard for me. Deeper, girls. Don't give up. Hey, I got something! Let's see. Clean it up. This is it. This is what's been missing! What is it, Professor? This is a buckle from a Confederate officer. This proves that this site was used by a civil war unit. Darling! Professor, what would a Confederate unit be doing this far west? Well, that's the question, isn't it? Keep digging! Let's find out! [GROANING] We're looking for a cave. Two shares to the man who finds it first! [ENGINE RUMBLING] Professor, it looks like somebody's coming. Visitors from the real world. Maybe they know who won the World Series. Wade. [GUNSHOT] Wade! Wade. Bastards! [LAUGHTER] Got him smack in the middle of the head, man. Nah, just grazed him. Where'd that old guy go? Fuck him. This is the one Reaper wants. All right. Looks like we're gonna get your bike after all, asshole. You should have taken the 400 bucks. [LAUGHTER] Where's your dog now, asshole? What's wrong with you, badass? Thirsty? [LAUGHTER] Come on, let's get outta here. Oh, hey, man. Hey, I'm sorry. Look, once you get up, we'll go a little bit slower. [CHUCKLING] Ready? Let's go. Agh! [LAUGHTER] Come on, pretty boy. Here we go. [LAUGHTER] Hold on. Having fun? Having fun back there? [LAUGHTER] Woo. Oh, yeah. Hold on. Hold on tight! It looks like you could use some help. Who are you? Folks call me the Rainmaker. You're the Rainmaker? Mm-hm. I've heard of you. Are you with Reaper? I made that mistake once. I'm looking for him with a man named Wade. Wade Olsen? He was here. They shot him. What? Well, they just grazed him, and he's OK, but they took him away to meet Reaper. Which way now, man? Well, he said between the two tallest peaks. I guess that'd be those two up there on the left. I guess so. They all look the same to me. Let's get the hell outta here. All right. What the fuck is going on? Jesus, he's got it wrapped around a rock. What? Get him. We're gonna kick his fucking ass. You stupid-- Son of a bitch! You're dead, asshole! You are one dead asshole. I'm dragging back a corpse. [GUNSHOT] Good timing, Rainmaker. What did you bring her along for? Reaper could be anywhere. Nice to see you again too, Wade. Hey, I'm glad to see you. It's dangerous. That's all. RAINMAKER: Looks like they drug you halfway across the desert. SKIN: Are you all right. Wade? I was really worried about you. WADE: Yeah, I'm fine. I enjoyed being a surfboard. RAINMAKER: Hey, Wade, what's the plan? Reaper's not far from here. I think we can reach-- Hold it right there. Hey, come on, man. Just be cool and put that thing down. Hey, just stay back, asshole, OK? Come on, just show us some mercy, and we'll show you some. Mercy? Who do I look like to you, Florence fucking Nightingale? Hey, man, don't say I didn't give you a chance. Yeah. [GUNSHOT] I gave him a chance. You're not too smart, you know. SKIN: I tried, Wade. I invested the money I took from Reaper, but you know the score. Some brokers got yachts off of me and I got shit. And then I met Catfish. You know me. There's something about me and a man on a bike. Oh, yeah. That means a whole lot. I thought he was a good guy. I really did. He treated me better than anybody else ever did. Oh, now, look, this is breaking my heart. But what the hell's Reaper doing out here? Where is he? Well, you ever heard of Quantrill's Raiders? Sure, Confederate guerrillas. Black souls, they were. SKIN: Well, the story is that somewhere along the line they came west to stash a bunch of gold that they stole from a Union bank. They hid it with the Hopis, intending to pick it up after the South won the war. Only, the South lost and Quantrill's Raiders were killed. - So what happened to the gold? The gold was never found. Now we know what Reaper's after. Then about three years ago, Catfish and Hangman, his running partner. were going through Hopi burial sites, looking for jewelry. Huh, this nice guy of yours is a grave robber. Give me a break, Wade. He's a prick. I know that now, OK? Anyway, they found a map, and they took it to a Hopi in the city to be translated. And what did it say? It said "horse soldiers gold." Go on. Well, Hangman got busted for crank and did time. And then they divided up the map and set a day to meet after Hangman's parole. Let me guess. Hangman didn't make it. He was Reaper's cellmate. Who do I ride with? Why don't you take a Greyhound back to Nebraska? Very funny. You're not gonna leave her here. Skin, this could be dangerous. What do you care what happens to me? Look, you're a nice kid, that's all. Kid? Wade, have you looked at me lately? Hey, just go ahead and do whatever you want, all right? I will! [SCREAMING] That's enough! Who are you? Leonard Bowen, professor at U&M. Professor of what? History. What are you doing out here? It's a field trip. Navajo Nation-- Have you found a cave? A cave? A cave! Look at this. Have you seen this cave? No. There's no caves up here! Reaper, let us have the bitches, man. When we're finished. Come on, that's bullshit. There's no cave. We followed you halfway across the desert. There's no cave. There's no gold. Let us have the bitches. [GUNSHOT] Ugh! I said, when we're finished. Where the hell is it? If my guess is right, this is it. What do you mean? Give me-- give me your map. I don't think it's a cave. I think it's a marker. REAPER: Meaning what? Meaning, your map leads you here to match those black shapes. From here, you have to read both maps together. Yeah, yeah, so go ahead. Well, there's a lightning bolt on both maps in the corners, unrelated to anything else. Your map has 15 marks. Just marks, nothing else. I thought the gold would be buried 15 feet deep. The gold? My God. You don't think Quantrill's Raiders brought the gold here? I don't care who the fuck brought it here. I'm the one that's taking it away. Maybe the marks on your map means miles and the squiggly line on the wall indicates a river. The tepees are 15 miles downriver. An Indian camp or something. And what's the lightning? We'll find out when we get there. Get where? There isn't a river within 100 miles of here. Not anymore. So what are we gonna do? Keep the girls here a couple hours, in case this doesn't work out. I don't want you touching 'em. Then what? Catch up to us. And what do we do about them? Whatever you want. Move out! What's gonna happen to us? You heard them. You saw them. We're all gonna get killed. Look, the Professor has a pistol in the rover. We just have to get to it. Are you crazy? Look, he just killed one of his own guys. She's right. We're all gonna get gang-raped. God, we're gonna be famous, all right. We'll be all over the news when they find our bodies. Oh, bullshit! Both of you, shut up. Shut up, everybody. Leonard will get us out of this. I know he will. He has a way with people. My bike looks like shit. Mine too. All this dust out here. Need a good wax. You know what I mean? What about Reaper? He said to leave the girls alone for a couple of hours. All i heard Reaper say was, don't touch 'em. Hey. All right, ladies, nap time's over. No, no! [SCREAMING] You can't do this. You heard what Reaper said. Mr. Reaper was called away on business! I'll be operating in his stead. You saw what he did to the other guy. He'll do the same to you! Reaper's not here anymore, dickhead! Who wants to go first? You, mama, I want that bike polished! Come on, do it now! I have nothing to use. Use them rags you got on! Do it! [GUNSHOT] All of it! All of it, baby! All of it! I won't do what you want. Why don't you do as you're told? Come on, ladies. We got bikes enough for all y'all! Come on! Get to work, now! [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Let's go. Fellas, we're gonna go on a date tonight to the movies! Hey, Jefferson, come on! Yeah, now, polish! Come on. Use them rags, baby, use 'em! Come on, do it! Come on, turn around and clean the bike! Do it now! Come on, move! Come on. Shine it. Shine that chrome, honey! Do it! Polish it! - Yeah, ladies. Polish it. Three blind mice. Three blind-- polish! Come on, move it! Yeah. Come on. Polish it, honey. Yeah, yeah, come on. Come on, do it, baby. Do it for me. Do it for the reptile, honey. Yeah. Come on, baby. Shine it. Move it more. I don't wanna see anymore dust on it. Come on, move it, move it. Harder, harder! Do it. Yeah, look at these ladies! Mr. Jefferson, are you happy? Your motorcycle's looking mighty fine today. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, ladies. Are we having fun now? Come on, honey. Let's go. Let's go. Do it. Come on, honey, do it! Come on! Come on. Jefferson wants his bike clean! Now, do it! Come on, bitch. I don't see you moving anymore. Let's go! JEFFERSON: Don't miss no spots. MAN: Don't miss no spots! You heard what the man said. He's second in command here. I don't know if I can control myself with all this jiggling around here. I think I'm gonna get ready to break Reaper's rule. [SOBBING] Yeah, I'm starting right now. No! [GUNSHOT] Take cover! [GUNSHOTS] Take this. Hey. Oh, Wade, hold on tight. Hey, Wade! God dang. Surprise, asshole. I'm really gonna enjoy this. [GUNSHOT] [CHUCKLING] SKIN: All right! [CHUCKLING] [HOWLING] Yeah! Sweet Jesus. Skin, I want you to ride back to LA with the girls. You can't tell me what to do. I'm not telling you. I'm asking you. This thing could be dangerous. Really? Look, just ride back to LA with the girls. I'll look you up when this thing's over with. Sure you will. You'll find the gold, and I'll be just another bimbo memory. I'm not after the gold. Reaper, I found it! Start digging where the lightning bolt points. It won't be too deep. When they buried it, they didn't have much time. Neither do I. Neither do I. I'll handle this. You go after Reaper. All right. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Come to papa, sucker! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] What the hell is this? What the hell is this darn thing, anyhow? [BEEPING] Hey, asshole. Drop the gun. I said, drop the gun. Aw, come on, kid. You wouldn't shoot an old man, would you? Yeah. Yeah, I think I would. Without a fair fight? You think you're a real cowboy, don't you, grandpa? Could be. Well, then, let's draw. [GUNSHOT] Dig it out! Dig it out! It's here. It's gold. Gold. Gold! Yeah, this is it. [CHUCKLING] After all this time. All this time. [GUNSHOT] Reaper, I thought we had a deal. Partnership's dissolved. [GUNSHOT] We never could have trusted him. Now we won't have to. Master, we're taking the gold down. Start the road. Get away from my gold. My gold too. Come all this way with you. I'm not sharing this with anybody, especially some two bit grease monkey. What about loyalty, man? Fuck loyalty. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Ugh. They won't help you this time, Reaper. The ones I didn't kill, you did. We'll go 50-50. I have a lot of gold here, Olsen. Gold ain't worth where you're headed, Reaper. God, you get a small mind, Olsen. Go ahead, then. Take me back to prison. Not this time. Where you going now? I don't know. Maybe Mexico for a while. How about you? Nah, I'm off to Hawaii. I wanna thank you for riding shotgun with me on this. My pleasure. You know, Hawaii this time of year is worth a visit. Yeah, there's an old, old man there. Sort of a Rainmaking kahuna. I owe him a visit. Why don't you come with me? Nah, think I need some time alone. You won't ride alone for long. What's that, another fortune cookie? Well, let's just say a-- a premonition. God be with you, son. Hey, boy, come here. Good to see you, pal. Good to see you, pal. Good to see you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a sweet guy. You're a sweet guy. I was just sitting there and he came out of nowhere. Skin. Where you riding to? Nowhere in particular. I was just headed there myself. Mind if I ride along for a while? For a while. Good. You know me. Something about a man on a bike. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. Hey, your dinner's ready. How you doing with this homework? I'm just about finished. Liar, liar, pants on fire! Yeah? You're gonna eat your dinner. Then you're gonna do this homework, all right? - OK. - Huh? Huh? You telling the truth? Yeah. Let's go, come on. Olsen! [MUSIC PLAYING]
