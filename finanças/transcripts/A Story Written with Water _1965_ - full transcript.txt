YOSHIDA "Tell me, Shizuo, "is your lover Yumiko really a virgin?" You go for a walk, I presume? No, not really... Go, enjoy it. But be careful. Drop me at home. You can come with us. I don't want to be disturb you. It appears that your boss will remarry with Shizuka. His problem is that he must ask your permission, as she is your mother. But it's been a long time he loves her. Mr. Yamazaki is a good guy. I understand that he wants to remarry. And your mother is so beautiful, she looks like she is only 30years. She passed the age of remarrying. She would better think of becoming a grandmother. In our time, 50was regarded as a beautiful age for women. How dare you talk so bluntly? It might be unconsciously, but aren't you jealous of Yamazaki? You can not endure seeing them together. How the girls have changed! It's these magazines that are to blame. Yes. It's the dubious men's magazines. Who lives now in the house across the street? Just a babysitter. I made you wait. It seems that Shizuo wants a very simple marriage. But in my situation... Me, I don't bother. No, you must help me to convince her. Yumiko is my only daughter. I want a beautiful wedding. I'll talk to my son. He must be convinced. You are always the same. You have not changed. I don't believe you. In 10years, we change. Wrong. Here, sitting next to you, everything is as before. Shizuka! You do not want to renew our relationship? It's 10years now that I am jealous. - You stayed single? - You know that very well. We must not... Don't worry. Papa is so happy that I will get married. He does not care for the rest. Shizuo! Come, I'll wash you. My darling! You should not take a bath... Support on me. I came here during the war. Really? You really don't want? You're weird. We will soon get married. Not before the ceremony. You ask silly questions. I know why. "Your fianc?e Yumiko, is she really a virgin?" This is a joke out of jealousy. Today, I did not think about it. It does not concern you if I am a virgin or not? All men are concerned, and that is normal. Or maybe you love me so much that it does not count? When we marry, the past of the other is no longer important. That's how I see it. You speak of experience. I do not care. Since I have chosen you. Tell me, it is harder for a man than for a woman. Tell me, Shizuo. How you did you do? Idiot! You don't ask these questions. Shizuo! Your mother is very beautiful. You'd think it was your sister. Shizuo, you still sleep with her? I dreamed of your mother once. Dreamed? What you say! You see what I mean? You have been drinking too much. I do not like these business dinners. It's boring. I pity you. Come on. Whereto? Don't worry, nobody will know. Shizuo... How do you know my name? It's sweet, right? Come dance! He is beautiful, your future son-in-law! If you would not get married soon I would take you as a lover. How do you know me? I was in college with Yumiko. It was his father who asked me to take care of you. Mr. Hashimoto? Really? We tend to be more discrete. Yumiko will be happy with a man like you. I am going. No way! Please... stay! Mr. Hashimoto does this for his daughter Yumiko. Shizuka Matsutani Good evening. What's wrong? I was with Mr. Hashimoto. I drank too much. Drink this salt water. It will make you vomit. Idiot! Why drink so much of it? I'm allright. No. You forget that you are going to get married soon! But hey! You have lipstick on your neck. I danced with a geisha. You were with Mr. Hashimoto? He stayed. Mom... What? And if we cancelled the marriage? It's your father-in-law...? No, nothing happened. I do not really want to marry anymore. Stop thinking like that. Poor Yumiko! Good night. Enjoy your last few nights as a bachelor. Sleep well. Shizuo! Shizuo, get up! We have a surprise visit. Tell me, Shizuo... What a nice man you have become! Misako brought a wedding present. Thank you. Congratulations on having found such a great party. Your mother must be reassured. Congratulations. I was so happy to learn the news. They will be a beautiful couple. And Mr. Hashimoto is also the sponsor of your Ikebana lessons. It's perfect. Yumiko is a young girl, so cheerful. I wonder if it will work. I worry a little. It will be okay, once married. If there are things you can't tell your mother, do not hesitate to ask me for advice. About the relation between man and woman for example. Misako, children! They do not understand. You have two children? In fact, I expect another since three months. Shizuo! You come back from school? Are you impressed? Misako, excuse me if I am wrong. But your boyfriend is not really the first man in your life, not? This is unfair. All men like to have fun, and they want their women to be virgin! What a selfishness! The important is that no one knows anything. In this regard... If I was a virgin at my wedding? It's so long ago, I forgot. I have the impression that I was, but maybe not. But you know, Misako, to know a man is not so terrible as that, it's just a fleeting moment. Thank you, ma'am. Excuse me to have addressed this topic, but you reassured me for my wedding. Misako, I have to go shopping. Can you stay? - Yes. - Thank you. Well, Shizuo returned. See you soon. Shizuo! You're here, Shizuo? Ah! There you are. If you knew how happy I am! I'm going to marry with the son of a sake-maker. He is a football champion. He is very beautiful. What a luck! For a girl, marriage is the most important thing. Offer her heart and her body to one man. Always live loving. Then have children. I want three of them! Shizuo, please... say nothing to your mother. Agree? This is our secret. Sorry! It's because I loved you... No, it's the handwriting of a man. Sorry. Who asked you? Who used you? I will give it back to you. I do not know how to apologize. If the boss found out about this, I... I would lose my place. Please. I will not say anything. On the contrary, this time, you talk of a connection between my mother and Mr. Hashimoto... I beg your pardon, but there was... once a rumor... Who spoke to you? No one particular. The other day, I saw them together. And then? They are our parents, no! Of course. You're right. I want a normal marriage. I shall not covet money nor the position of your boss. Do not judge others by your ideas! My darling! We must not die. We have to fight. Whatever happens, I do not give up. Come on, let us embrace. No, not like that. Stop. I am out of breath. Thank you. I'll go first. Shizuo, rest a little with papa. Shizuka, I cause you many problems. Everything is my fault. Take care of everything. I'm good for nothing. Hang on, darling! Fight to live! Shizuo, you may have seen things moved. Do not judge your mother severely. One day you will understand. I love Mom. Hurry! Hurry to return to protect your mother. Go quickly! Mom! Shizuo! Mom! - And Dad? - He told me to return for you. Yumiko! Come here. Come see our floor! Arrange it to your taste. Without question: This room will be both of us. With a western bed. You like it? I've only slept in those in hotels. Rendez-vous hotels? Don't be stupid. Don't be angry. All singles go there, right? How romantic! Now, no more reason to go there. Your mother is sick since a long time. That's true. That's why Dad had so many adventures. And now? I do not know. He is not so young anymore! Shizuo... So we had separated because Shizuo growing because... When I think of it, it was for his own good. But I regret that. Do not say that. It is the truth. As you are beautiful! As you know, without me, you had fun. When a woman like you abandons you, you want to be entertained. But people are unpredictable. Do you talk about me? Yes. You came back to me while I did not hope for you anymore. Say nothing. We should not be embarrassed. Will we meet regularly? Shizuo may have guessed. Do not worry. Now we will meet in the evening. Why are you back? Even if his father would agree, what would Yumiko think? He's not the kind to refuse before marriage. You're weird. She has charm, I know. She's much better than me. I know. I am not insensitive. But it is sometimes difficult reconciling sex and marriage. Why do you get married, then? Because Yumiko is in love? Your mother raised you alone? I know a boy like you. He sleeps with a lot of girls, but when you talk about marriage he scrolls. This is a son out of wedlock. He does not know what is a home. What is this doll? Is that you? What? They say you are like that. You dare tell me that! Who is my father? Shizuo! Shizuka Matsutani Good evening. It's so hot I took a bath. What's wrong? Are you okay? The more your wedding approaches, the more you look sad. Someone told me about you and Mr. Hashimoto, and this has rekindled memories. So it's true? And you... What do you think? You're still beautiful. You had to be even more 10years ago. I guess you made every man go crazy. I knew you would interrogate me. You are adult. You can understand. When I was small, I thought you disappeared suddenly without giving reasons. That's why. Mom... Even when Dad was sick? Shizuo! How can you imagine such a thing? If this were the case, I could be Hashimoto's son. And then... Yumiko would be my sister. You are the son of my husband. The only son of Takao Matsutani! Of course, but I wanted you to tell me. It is you who put me in the world. I can only entrust to you. If you have such ideas, it's my fault. Mom! You're my mother. Hashimoto is the father of Yumiko. Try not to be alone with him. Marriage is a strange institution. Who could invent that? It was only after marriage that I loved your father. It's the same for most couples. Here... your school notebooks. Once married, you show them to Yumiko. What is that? This is nothing. How not? This is your umbilical cord. My cord...? Is it for me or for you? It's hard to say. Mother, your umbrella. Dad, you can go now. Driving at night is dangerous. I have a driver. He even drives when he has drunk. We're going to separate here. Thank you. Bye. Why cry? We will spend the night at the hotel. Shizuka. Really... I thank you, for everything. You treated me well. Que dis-tu! You will heal, that's for sure. Today, I feel better. But this means that my body is weakening, that I have no strength to fight anymore. But no! That's because you're doing better. I love your smell. Shizuka... Show you... so I do not forget you. I beg you. You are beautiful. I am happy, Shizuka. Take care of your body. I want you to stay always so beautiful. Kiss me. I understand. I acted like your husband. It is a proof of love. I will love you in his place. You're strange. At night, you remain unmoved. And in broad daylight, you want me. I do not care. I finally felt desired. I finally thought that you regretted our marriage. One could believe that, indeed. It's not your fault. It's my fault. How to tell? I find it hard to say: I love you. I understand. You lived alone with your mother. I understand. I love you! We form a beautiful couple. Yes. What a change! Why? Last time you were so far away. This is normal. We were not yet married. Do I please you? What? I talk about my body, of course. Yes, I like it. The whole family is together! I, the widow, am I unwanted? No, there is still food to eat. I have great news. Next month you become head of department. You will be the first head of department who is less than 30years. Thank you for it. He is good for the bank, but one day he will follow you. Hashimoto, you chose your son with care. I know. I also want to thank you. You're lucky to have them near to you. I, in the evening, I am alone at the table. Is Shizuka okay? He was offered a stereo. She's okay. Say, Dad, could you not plead the cause of Mr. Yamazaki at the side of the mother of Shizuo. What do you think, Shizuo? The bold and the beautiful. I wanted to talk to you about this for a long time. This is not the reason of his promotion. He has great qualities. I gotta go. I forgot something. Excuse me. Stay with them. Just at the most important moment. How selfish, your father! Marriage makes you even more beautiful As a woman, are you satisfied? Do not be intrusive. Yumiko, help me to find a wife. Ask Shizuo. His mother will listen. It is true? Listen to me, Shizuo, Mr. Head of department, do something. It is sad to lay next to an empty pillow at night. I bring this to your mother. Eh... Mr. Head of department! They are all selfish! Yumiko, console me. Stop! Shizuo! Come back soon! You... I think you do not love me. You're wrong. No, I am sure. Even an old one like Yamazaki is full of enthusiasm. But you... Yamazaki is vicious. With tears in his eyes, he tried to embrace me, with incredible force. But you, you're indifferent. You do not want me. Why? If you do not love me, say it frankly. It's not your fault. You're insensitive. That is true. In this house, I do not feel free. What do you mean? I always feel that your father observes me. And all desire is extinguished. Are you sure this is the real reason? Yes. Why not having said that earlier? I'm your wife. I'll go anywhere with you. Your father will accept? I don't care. Good. We will move. Tomorrow, I will look for an apartment. No. Not tonight. But, after the move, you will have to love me a lot. Are you there? I passed by. Heartless one! Since you are married, you forgot your mother. Are you going out? Yes, for a lesson. But I have time. Do you want some tea? Tea... no. A beer, then? I have them cool. Do you like your new apartment? Just the two of you is better. You go along well with Yumiko? I am concerned. You do not have to worry. You are my only son. It is normal that I am concerned. You do not want? No. It makes me blush. Never mind. You have been appointed head of department? - Who told you? - Who? Who talked to you about my promotion? Mr. Hashimoto. You don't tell me nothing. You do not want to remarry? What a strange idea! My boss loves you well. - Not me. - Why? What do you think, you? You wanted so much that I stay here. You have changed your mind? Mom, you do not feel alone? Sometimes. Of course. So I remember happy days with your father. We had a great happiness. When he became ill, I tried everything. I did everything I could. I have no regrets. That's what counts most, Shizuo. I gotta go. Do you accompany me? He is a strange student. She wants to learn Ikebana in 10days. Shizuo... still no baby? I do not want. Why? It's thanks to you that I survived. It would be an unfortunate child. What a pessimism! Mom, you have an appointment with Hashimoto. During our honeymoon, I saw your umbrella... in a hotel of the spa. If I was reluctant to get married, it was fear that you would see him again. I did not want him! Mom, I beg you, no longer see this man. He despises us. Since Dad's disease, he tries to have us! Your remarriage, I don't care. Mom... I just wish, that you are still my mother. I go back. Maybe I said too much. But I have only you. Are you gonna talk to Yumiko? I do not know. I can not predict it. I'm late. I was about to leave. Bye. Stay. I start early tomorrow. Your wife asked me to await your return. Good evening. He is quite nervous. This is normal. Alone with the wife of another, late in the evening. There is nothing to panic. Your eyes! It is not that of a husband. You invited Murata on purpose. It was calculated... to make him suffer and to test me. It is the role of a husband, right? You are despicable. Do you feel guilty? You're inhuman! And you? Daughter of Hashimoto! And then? You know. He and my mother had an affair and continue so. I suspected they would see each other. I wanted to dissuade my mother. You understand my emotion. Your father will come back very upset. If you do not believe me, go to your place, and you will understand. Yumiko does not want to return to the apartment. Really? What do you think? What to do if she is decided? Are you going to divorce? You should not have married. Did he have to talk to Yumiko? What has that to do with you two? Nothing. Do you really think so? Your mother is still desirable. But, she and me, we age. So, love and desire will eventually disappear. This is not an excuse. I think so. I'm unhappy, too, with my wife in bed. Not during the war. When dad lived were you already going to bed with my mother? Your father was too weak to satisfy a woman like her. Without love! I loved her. I love her still. Wrong! Calm down. We are here to talk between men. You collect women. Even the young geisha... That one... I often slept with her. Do not tell Yumiko. The connection with my mother lasts how long? I can not remember... more than 20years. I was already born? I think so. Why do you ask that? If I was not born yet, maybe I have the same father as Yumiko. Did you ever think of that? Do not say bullshit! Can you prove it? And you dare marry Yumiko! I am thirsty. Did I sleep long? A full day. Have I spoken? I was so scared when I learned about the accident. But this is not very serious. Hashimoto... he died? Mere scratches. He had a lot of luck. Ah... Let's return home. Home? Yes, at your place. Shizuo, you must return to Yumiko. You resign to go to Hashimoto? No, I'm going nowhere. How's that? Have you talked to someone? No, to nobody. I want to take a little rest. Aren't you feeling well? You are embarrassed because I thought of marrying your mother? I do not think of it anymore. I know everything. Hashimoto told me. Bye. Why drink so much? This is not good for your health. You want water? What is that? A sleeping pill. Sometimes I take one. Go quickly to bed. Mom... I was dreaming. A strange dream. A river dragged me. When I awoke, I was near a lake I knew. The sunset was magnificent. The sky and water, everything was red. Mom... let's die together. To become free, we have no other way. You're still so young. Even that is a burden. Mom! You, here. Mom is gone. Your mother? Mom and me had decided to die together... but she's gone, alone, with medications. Shizuo! When I thought I was going to die soon, I finally understood that I love you. I felt deeply that I can only be one with you. This is the truth. Is there someone? - Hurry! Get over here. - What is it? They passed very late. To go to the mountains.
