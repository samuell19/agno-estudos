But Darby needs somewhere to drive around with Tess, Kimber and Ben! Santa doesn't have enough Darby Dream Wagon's to give out. The workshop is backed up. It's right here in the catalog. Can't you just buy it for me, daddy? It's only 74.99. A steal. The Christmas tree skirt factory is closing. We have to save money until I can find another job. And my holiday ice sculpting job is dried up since the accident. But Holly, we promise, it'll still be a great Christmas. Cheer up, Holly. At least we still have each other, right? Dear Santa, this Christmas, all I want is for my parents to go away, that's it. Can you make that happen? Love, Holly Winters. Naughty or nice this year, little girl? I'm a grown ass woman, bitch. That is not Christmassy! What the? Come on! That's right, frozen fish was Chef Ho's secret sauce. The fraud was then arrested for assault. Ho has closed the doors today because of the scandal that was about to break. So Ho is no, longer. What a tragedy. I know, Dean. I just love, love, loved their crab leg tower. Where will we have our office Christmas party this year? Don't you mean holiday party? Please don't give me that war on Christmas face, Christie. Cut. Great show today, Dean and Christie. Can I speak to you for a moment, Holly? I just wish you were a little bit more like Christie. Christie is like a talking tube of lipstick. Yeah, she's also pregnant. It's Dean's. So I gotta dump her from the show. Pregnancies make people uncomfortable, especially me. Yeah but, Christie's always in front of that giant desk, no one will even know. But I will. And because you'll never succumb to having children, I want you to fill that empty chair. As anchorwoman? The, anchorwoman of Channel 6 News. Well uh, what about my investigations? Do you wanna keep wearing your ugly wigs and playing undercover dress up? Or do you want to triple your salary? The second thing. I'm, I'm in. Not so fast, Connie Chung. Once you take that seat, you'll be the face of this station. Billboards, bus benches, even those annoying little screens in the back of cabs. Yeah. Image is everything, and yours sucks. Screw you, Kevin. But, I have a way for you to take that giant sack of coal out of your ass. You're headed to Ornaments, the Christmasiest town ever, to cover their annual Ornaments Festival of Christmas Wonders. All their parties and events. They even have a hot cocoa ho down. Whatever that means. And you'll be checking in nightly with Dean and prego Christie. And since you're from there, you'll give the story a hometown spin. Look, I appreciate the gesture, but I hate Ornaments and everything that it stands for. You mean Christmas? It celebrates the tacky commercialism of some like. - Oh my God. Miracle baby born in a barn. I am never, ever going home, okay? Ornaments will land you the dream job people would kill for. Plus, while you're there, maybe you'll fall in love. Yeah, okay. Love. Gross. I'm Holly Frost and you're watching Channel 6 News. Good evening, I'm Holly Frost and you're watching Channel 6 News. Yeah, it's gonna be great. Trying to get to Ornaments before I have to be live on camera. I'm sorry I'm late. Thanks for all the help. I'm Sam. I'm your camera man. You know anything about Ornaments? Unfortunately. Boat loads of Christmas events happen there every year and idiot people from all over the country come to partake in a joyous time in the snow. That sounds fun. Yeah, it's not, trust. So um, who are they, your sisters? Those are my ladies. It's my wife Lacey and our daughter Taylor. Huh. Lacey passed last year. Oh, I'm so sorry. How? Cancer. Mm. What kind? Cancer. Oh, right. Yeah. Let's just uh, get this over with, shall we? All right. I'm gonna take a-- Buckle up. Quick nap. Whoa, are you okay? Yeah, yeah yeah, it's fine. What is it? We made it to Ornaments. Sick. All right. Okay, I'll go fetch the rooms to the hotel. Maybe you can uh, score some coffee? Something festive. Shit. Oh, Jesus dude. Oh my God! Bonjour, madam. Hi. What can we get you today? Um, two La Prancer's peppermint mocha latte's. Okay, coming right up. Great. Hey listen, you don't have any booze back there, do you? Uh. Whatever kind, really. You're funny. Yeah, I wasn't. Nevermind. Go, make the latte's. Holly, Winters, is that you? Uh, it's actually Holly Frost now, Danica. Where's the ring? Oh I didn't, I didn't get married, I just changed my name. From Winters to Frost, but why? They're basically the same thing. Nope, they're not. Well, I'm actually married. And get this, I'm the Mayor now. It's crazy, right? Hm. Today, I am giving back to our community. Did you want me to wrap anything for you? Oh, just your sweet little mouth. I see you're just the same old Grinchy Holly. Oh no, come on, look. I can be cordial. Like how is your hot cousin? Oh, you mean my cousin Chris Pringle. The one who you dumped via IM on graduation day? No that you would care, but Chris has actually been through a lot recently. He just lost his wife. Hopefully not to, cancer. Hot air balloon. Like it caught on fire? No. One fell on her. Holly. Your latte's are ready. Oh, great. Hey, these uh, bows could use a little work there, Mayor. Pretty uh, limp. It's not limp. Hotel's sold out. Yeah, since it's the 75th anniversary, everything's booked. But I got a better idea. I can just put a blow up in the back of the van and uh, I'll sleep in the front seat. It's not necessary. I have a place we can stay. Oh, Holly! Son of a nutcracker, you're really here! This is magical, wow. - Hi! - Hi. Okay, yeah, all right. Oh, you're really shaking there. Okay, that's quite enough. Oh my gosh. Let me look at you. Just, wow. My little sister, the big city TV star in the flesh. I just, oh hi. Is that your boyfriend? No, it's my camera man. His name is Sam. Camera man Sam. Camera man Sam. That is fun to say. I'm Cookie. Oh, Hol, I'm just so tickled you're back. We have so much catching up to do. We can wrap gifts and sip cider and oh, we can cook a holiday beef brisket on Christmas night. Yeah, no. I leave first thing on the 25th. I'm just, I'm just here for work. Oh. Boo. Well, I will take what I can get, so. That's great. How bout some of that cider? I have so much cider. I have three different flavors of cider. I have nutmeg cider, which is crazy, I know. There it is, just like you left it. Not really. What is all this shit doing in here? Oh, I turned the attic into my Christmas sweater sewing studio. Okay. Holly, I really wish you'd reconsider leaving Christmas morning. It would mean a lot to have you here for the holiday. You know, spend some quality time with family, with me. Yeah, I um, I really gotta get ready for the story, so. Hey, I can take a hint. Mm. Oh, so cute. Dear Satan? I wrote Satan. Greetings. Chad Pringle and? Joy Wreath. O-M-Gingerbread, I heard rumors she was back in town. Is the famous Holly Winters really sitting with us right now? It's Holly Frost now. Oh, you got married. Why does everyone keep asking me that? I love the blazer. Coral, or is it more tangerine? It's definitely tangerine. I wish I could wear something so bold. My boss doesn't like me in anything but muted tones. And always a turtleneck. Mm, boss sounds like a controlling asshole. It's cousin Danica. Oh. Oh, Joy's the Mayor's assistant. And, I'm working for your aunt now. Aunt Becky's still alive? After years of consuming all that butter and sugar by the truckload. Holly was always such a kidder. My funny, fabulous bestie. And then she dumped me and my brother Chris and all of Ornaments for bigger and brighter things. Not that I'm still totally devastated by it. Well, I mean, what? Chad, and Holly. Chris. Sup. Wow, Christmas came early. Yeah. Uh, we'll see you both later? At the bakery, for letters to Santa? Yeah. Um, uh, maybe um, after my gig we could uh, uh, catch up, you know. Grab dinner or something. Yeah Hol, I'd really love that. Cool. Who's the pretty lady, daddy? Oh Faith, I'd like you to meet my old friend. This is Holly. You have a kid? He does indeed, hi. What are you asking Santa for this year? Excuse me? Santa. What do you want for Christmas? I don't see a ring on that finger, so perhaps to land a husband. Maybe you should ask your daddy for a reality check on both this year. What? You don't believe in love or Santa? I mean what is the point of living? It's almost six, Holly. We gotta start setting up. Oh, thank Christ. Um, well we'll make a plan later then? Yeah, I uh, I don't really think I'm gonna be hungry, but thanks. Santa is real, sweetie. I spy my big city successful niece! Aunt Becky? Is Rudolph's nose red? Oh, hello. You must be Holly's main squeeze. Uh. Call me Aunt Becky, everyone does. Are you sure that you're my Aunt Becky? I mean the last time I saw her she was-- Round? Big, plump. Yeah. I lost 162 pounds this past winter. Jesus. Well I definitely prayed to him about it. But what really melted that stubborn fat away was a change in diet. I used to constantly taste test my cookies. But then I started to play a game with myself. I would give them all names. Like my little cookie children. I wouldn't eat my children. Okay, so what about the people who do eat them? Don't mind if I do. Hey, get your. So why are you dressed like you're about to service a fruitcake? Well this is my caroling costume, thank you for asking. I'm on my way to rehearsal right now. Oh sweetie, you should come. You've always had the most beautiful singing voice. Yeah, it was kind of millennial. Debbie! Oh, here, can you hold this. Debbie. I don't wanna. Alcohol, where is the alcohol. So uh, where's Chris? Chris is with my brother, the sheriff, over on Quinton Avenue. Chris spotted some vaping teens trespassing on Goldman's property hooking up Christmas lights. Personally I think they were doing them a favor. They are the only house on the street without any Christmas lights. People are allowed to be Jewish in Ornaments, Danica. I never said that. See y'all on TV. Let's do this. All right. Okay, here we go. Smile, smile, smile. Live in three, two, one. It is such a joy to watch these faces jot down what they might like from Santa. I'll be back here tomorrow night for the hot cocoa ho-down. Yeehaw! I'm Holly Frost, Channel 6 News, Christie, Dean. And we're out. Drink, please. Awesome. Here, let me get you a glass. Don't worry about it. I'm just gonna drink from the bottle, but thanks. I'll, I'll be right back. Greetings. Dear Satan, it's been 21, scratch that. 22 years. Thanks for ruining Christmas, dick. You can keep it. Screw you. Sincerely, not yours. Holly Frost. Hey uh, do you wanna show me the back of your van? Uh. Come on. Business. Casual. Take off your pants. I have to take off the shoes first. But shouldn't we like just start kissing? Oh, there's gonna be absolutely no kissing. Okay. Let me help you with those. Really? What's wrong? It's not you. It's that. It's my wife. I'm not sure I'm ready to do this to her. Okay. To be honest, we should just. I mean, try to keep this thing professional. Professional. That's how I ended up in the back of your van. With my top off. By both of us keeping things super professional. We've got. Oh, and by the way, your earring is super lame. Where did you get it? Hot Topic? My daughter. My daughter got me this. And I'm drunk. ♪ Four golden rings ♪ ♪ Three ♪ Darby's Dream Wagon. Woo! Party rocking. Coming in and I'm a-- Ah, bummer! Whoa! What the hell? Okay. Uh, all right. Pull over, ma'am. Pull over. Great, the pigs here to ruin the fun. Ma'am, put your hands up. Don't flipping ma'am me. I am only 27 years old. Turn around, ma'am. Quit calling me-- Hello, sailor. Hi, hi, uh yeah there's something on the roof of my van and it seems pretty angry and uh. I, I don't know what it is. It could be a large person or a moose. No this isn't a joke. Hello? Hello? Ma'am, have you been drinking, ma'am? What are you gonna do? Breatheralyze me for ridin' around in a little bitty kids toy? Technically, you were driving. So we're gonna need to see some ID. Hm, okay. Well how bout I see your ID's, huh? I'm Sheriff Wreath. Hm. This is Deputy Wreath. You guys don't happen to be related to Joy, do you? Why, 'cause we're the only black people in town? Because your last name's are both Wreath. We're brothers. Joy's our sister. Sexy siblings. Bet your parents are pretty hot, too. They're dead. Samezies. Hello? So is Aunt Becky your real aunt? Mm-hm. 'Cause her angel cookies are the Nerd alert. Pretty hot nerd, though. Deputy. Sorry, um. Look, we're gonna let you off with just a warning. But that's only 'cause of Aunt B. She's been real supportive of us, less experienced singers. Oh God, you're a caroler? When in Ornaments, right? Well, gentlemen, it is getting late and it has been a pleasure. But I will see you later. Have a lovely evening. Come on! No. No no no no no no. No no no no no! Whoa! Help me, please, no! Hot Topic. God. Yes. Sam, come on, we gotta go. I need some caffeine before this sad hot cocoa ho-down. Come on Sam, giddy-up, let's go. Don't care if you're naked, I am coming in. Woo! Yeah I've called Sam like 100 times and the news van is gone. I need you to send me another camera man, ASAP. Preferably one without a dead wife. No, there's no time, Holly. If Sam doesn't resurface soon, just find a townie with camera experience. Oh, by the way, the audience seemed to buy what you were selling last night. So keep it up. Want to knit a Christmas sweater with me? I'm thinking maybe a cat riding a dog who's on a reindeer. And, they're all in Santa hats. As super fun and creative as that sounds, I need to find somebody who knows how to work a camera for tonight's segment because that sexy loser with the stupid sexy earring is MIA. Oh well what about Chris Pringle? When he's not selling Christmas trees, he's teaching videography at Ornaments High. And he's also single. My, my ex with the bizarro teen child, right. But I mean, what choice do I have? Oh, choose love. Ah, this is kinda like when we were back in high school. You doing the video morning announcements while I filmed it. Except, no braces for this guy. Carol's Electronics should have everything we need. There may be no need for Carol's. Hey, Kevins, we found the van, but there is obviously no sign of Sam. Holly, come here! Six, six, six. The number of the beast? I'll test the red stuff for you guys but I'm telling you, this is probably just a couple of teenage vaping hooligans out trying to have a good time. Okay, well my camera man is not at Ornaments Hospital, so theorize that one for me, Sheriff. Telling me how to do my job? Chris, I'll meet you back here in five. I'm gonna go smash a Texas Mickey of creme de cacao. Hm, okay. Thanks, Candace. Hey, are you two coming to the hot cocoa ho-down? I'll be filming for a big city news station. Gosh, that sounds just swell. We'll be there as soon as we close up. Au revoir. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Yeah. All right, everybody. We are closed, so if you could go ho ho home. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Jingle all the way! Merry Christmas! Do you really want to go to that ho-down? Of course, it's a classic. It's my favorite event of the whole season. And you heard Mr Pringle, they're gonna broadcast it on live TV. We can wave at our mom's. But Mayor Danica won the song contest this year, which means she'll be singing "Saucy Santa" there tonight. That song makes my ears bleed, Cameron. Really, I, I think it's super catchy. Well let's just stay here. Or, do you wanna graduate high school still holding your V card? I thought I did. Think about it. Everyone will be at town hall, which means that we can scream, moan as loud as we want. Now do you? I don't know, Candace. Aunt Becky's got surveillance in case those vaping teens get the munchies. We never know when she might be watching us. Not today. Now. Now, take off that damn apron you sexy elf. When did you start swearing? That big city TV lady inspired me. Do you hear that?

A double date with a couple of cosplaying underage nerds. That's gonna be a hard pass. Trot off, Hope. It's Faith. Well maybe we can go out. Just the two of us. Chris, look I, I'm only in town for 72 hours and you're too good for me. What, who says? Says me. You're so sweet and I, oh God, I am so sour. That's my favorite kind of Chinese food. Ha ha ha. Alcohol? Aren't you on the clock? I didn't realize you were also a judge. Look, vodka is the only thing that is getting me through this week. Look, I'm worried about you. Well don't be. I'm gonna be Connie Chung soon enough. Come on, let's dance! Ha ha, Holly. Very funny. Holly! What's going on? Whoa, are you okay? Yeah, I just, um. I'm fine. Are you okay? Uh, yeah. I'm, I'm fine. Did you eat one of those Christmas ham balls? They are delicious but deadly. No, just a sip of spiked cocoa, but something got lodged in my throat. Oh, weird. It was this. Holly, isn't that camera man Sam's? Um, I need a minute. Well happy freakin' holidays. Was in the hot cocoa dispenser? Yeah. That's very bizarre. But, at least my handsome, charming, single brother was there to rescue you. Chad, I do not have time for a romance chat right now. I'm trying to tell you something important. Right, sorry, go ahead. Ever since I came back to Ornaments, weird shit. Stuff. - Shit. - Okay. Has been happening to me. First, my camera man disappears. Then I find his van with bloody sixes on it, and last night I end up choking on this? I'm not sure what you're getting at. I wrote Satan by mistake when I was seven. Wait, isn't that how old you were when your parents? Were hacked to death? Oh yeah. Apparently I asked Satan to get rid of them and then they wind up being murdered. And last night at the letters to Santa event, I wrote to him again. Why? What did you write? I called old heavy hooves a giant dick. Oh, Holly. And then, they got back to me via the Whit and Wagner Wine Bar ladies room. Uh, okay Hol, the person who hurt your parents. That was some nutty nut job dressed up as Santa the police could never find, right? The whole devil thing, you're not even religious. You don't believe in Satan, right? Right. You don't even believe in Christmas. Right, but. So this is some vaping teens playing an April Fools prank. It's December. But they're vapists. They don't know that. Oh, jingle my bells. What? Holly, this, this is John Smith. He's uh. Hey. An amazing farmer. Wow, that's hard. He's got the best, produce in all of Ornaments. Oh, you're too kind, Chady. Chady? Do people call you Chady? No. Oh, um sorry. No, you can call me that. I mean if you'd prefer Chad, I can you Chad. No, I don't prefer anything. That, that came out wrong. Um, well I better get going. I've got to iron out my suit before the gingerbread gala tonight, so. Nice to meet you and, see you later. Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, no. You got it? I got it. Okay. Bye. Bye. Well, it is pretty clear that he wants to take a nice juicy bite outta your apple. Why don't you flirt back? I tried. But, look at me. I'm probably not the guy's type. I gotta go fill a bunch of pie orders. And then the pies themselves. I'll probably eat one too. I'm so fat and alone. It is really good. I know, right? Hey, Holly. What, did you go on a shopping spree? They're for Danica. We still haven't found just the right dress for the gingerbread gala. Mm. I heard you met my brother, Cole. The singing Sheriff. He thought you were pretty cute. I mean, for an adult woman who steals Darby Dream Wagons. I'd be happy to set you two up on a date. I'm not interested in getting to know Cole, or any other band better in this creepy ass Christmas town. Second my gig ends, I am peacing out, never to return. I don't believe you, Holly Winters. That's not my name anymore. I see it, deep down. What are you talking about? The Christmas candle. Inside your heart. It's still lit. Okay, that makes like zero sense and you don't even know me, Joy. ♪ Joy to the world ♪ ♪ The Lord is come ♪ ♪ Let Earth ♪ ♪ Receive ♪ ♪ Her king ♪ ♪ Let every heart ♪ ♪ Prepare him room ♪ ♪ And heaven and nature sing ♪ ♪ And heaven and nature sing ♪ ♪ And he-eaven heaven and nature sing ♪ That was great.

So I don't think it's gonna be a really good fit for us. Oh. That, that's too bad. It really is. Yeah, it really, really is. Oh, but would you like to take one of my heavenly cookies over there? My little angels. Hi guys! For the road? Uh, I'm good. Are you sure? They're delish. Maybe uh, save it for the poor kids at the toy drive tomorrow night. Well now that is a thoughtful though, Cole. Yes, and um, okay. Well, you know what? Better try next year, right? Good try today. ♪ Aah ♪ All right, we'll see you a bit later then, Cole. Bye bye. Oh angel Jennifer, I shan't. Well what's, one little bite of your, your wing gonna do, right? Oh, I mean. How many calories can that be? I missed you so much. Mommy, why did you hurt me? What, what what? Oh my gosh. My angels, I didn't realize you guys were all alive. You killed Jennifer! Bad mommy! I, I didn't know what I was doing. I can make you a new friend. Please don't cry. Jingle bells! No. Do you know what time it is? Cookie time! Burn bright, my little star baker. That there's literally no waywh to get a coffee in a coffee shop this morning. Yes. Great, fantastic. Well, I hope you have a great day because you're making me have vodka for breakfast, again. Watch it. Don't help us or anything. Oh I uh, I wasn't going to. Um, give us a second, Joy. Of course. You know what, Holly? With Chris Pringle you are barking up the wrong Christmas tree. Oh my God, I am not interested in Chris Pringle. Okay, like maybe to like bang once before I bounce. Why is everybody so obsessed with love in this town? Well at least we can love something other than the bottle. Go back to the big city and drink your life away. Okay, and why don't you go straight to hell, Mayor. Ugh! The nerve. Uh, the gala committee needs you to approve tonight's gala decorations. They also have some questions about the auction. Why do I have to do everything? Because you're the mayor. I guess I'll have to try on my dresses at the hall, then. You're gonna look great in everything. Oh, thank you I, I mean I've been working out a lot, so. It shows. How's it going in there? Joy, do you call this polyester candy cane mess, classy? 'Cause if I wear it tonight, kids will lick me to death. Uh, well, there are still a few more options that you haven't tried. This one's custom. It's from Paris. Oh, now we're talking. Oh, but it's a size zero, so. Trust me. I'm a size zero, Joy. Of course you are. Double zero even. Joy, you weren't kidding. I think we have a winner. Do you need a hand? Oh thank you, Joy. It must have been a man that invented side zippers. See, I told you I was a size zero. Your bow looks a little limp, Mayor. Perhaps I could assist you with it, hm? Are you okay? Mayor? Danica? Mayor? Do you need me to come in there? Oh that dress is just to die for. I have this trick with butter and a coat hanger. I can get you right in there. Isn't that line a little tight? I'm coming in there. Is there any way to just like get a normal coffee around here? But you're so ho ho, hot, chocolate. Chad, that's not even a real play on words. Not everything said here has to be like, Christmas explosion. Nah, I disatree. Chad. I'll murder you in your sleep. That one needs work. Chad! What's going on? A monster took the Mayor! What? Let's go. She went through there. With him, the monster man. I didn't see him but he had this horrible chuckle like, nails on a chalkboard mixed with a lion's roar. Shit. We'll get one of your brother's down here to investigate. Maybe Cole. Yes, definitely, definitely Cole. Maybe he can see where the air vent goes, you know? Meanwhile just, try to relax, okay? How the frankincense am I supposed to relax right now? Well, you used to be a competitive snowman builder, right? Okay yeah, that's not a thing. Tell that to my coach. I medaled at the world snowman championship in Finland. Twice. Twice. Okay then go and build a freaking snowman. You know, frozen. You see, Chad. I am not crazy. I know you're not. This is not normal for Ornaments. For anywhere. Now for the eyes. I wonder what I can use. I can help you with those. I spy some pretty little eyes. Hello? Noel? Cole? No no, over here. That's right. Why don't you come a little closer. Would you like to be friends with a snowman, Joy? Would you like to go on a magical adventure just like you've always dreamed of? Hello? Shit. Oh Jesus! God, you scared the crap out of me. Where's Aunt Becky? Oh I, I don't know. I was downtown working on my nativity scene. It's gonna rock everyone's Christmas socks off. Aunt Becky said that she had choir practice here and then she was gonna carpool with us to the gala. Maybe she changed her mind. Now you go get ready. You have a gingerbread gala to cover. Right, yeah. Does it, kinda like, smell funny to you? Cookies. And let's drop by my nativity scene on the way there. This is it. Hey! Losers, my sister here, look she spent a lot of time on this nativity scene, so why don't you and your little friend go and fill your lungs with electronic teen cancer somewhere else? Get out of here. Scram. Thank you, Hol. Hey, I think your nativity scene looks... sweet. Oh! Thank you. Come on, let's go. See that little camel? The silent auction for the gingerbread houses is already underway. But these are not your typical structures. There are skyscrapers, theme parks, even a Mall of America. All made out of molasses and dough. Holly, do I spy a gingerbread Statue of Liberty? You sure do, Christie. Oh, America's never looked so delicious. Well, I'll be back here tomorrow night for the very white elephant gift exchange. Christie, Dean. Thanks Holly. Up next, Autumn. The very incredible baby hippo who can paint with her webbed feet. Adorable. Oh man. These cheapy candy cane heels. They're just, they're killing me. Oh great, the dancing portion of the evening has begun. Time to get the fudge home. Fudge, sounds like Ornaments' maybe rubbing off on you after all. Ha ha, it's not. I meant to say. Frost. Miss Frost. Oh, no thanks. Those ham balls taste like rat meat stuffed into dirty baby socks. Actually, I was wondering if you'd like to dance. Holly hates dancing. Prom night, senior year. She had us teepee the principal's house instead. Well, maybe I could um, make an exception. Jack Goldman. Goldman. You're the one who's house got Christmas lighted. By some vaping teen skamps. Why, is me being Jewish a problem? Not at all. I find it quite exotic. I mean, for this town. Are you good to pack up on your own? Sure. Great. Ooh. Deputy Wreath, you clean up like a maid at a frat house. I was wondering if I could have this dance. I I I was just gonna ask the same thing. Chris. Boys, she's taken. Well, I'm not taken. It's just supposed to be like a dance. Aren't you working, Goldman? Holly, one song, just you and me. Okay, boys, boys boys boys. There's no need to fight. Why don't we head back to my sister's place and have a little four person dance party in my childhood bedroom? Wait, I don't remember the floor in your room being that big, Hol. Honey what's, what's wrong? Danica, she, she's dead. Hey, Danica's just late to the gala. No, I saw her outside in a manger, dressed like a wise man. Oh my gosh! Chad, grab my camera, press the damn record button. Kevins, get me back on, I've got breaking news. Move people, out of the way! Now the quality of ivory in a hippos tusk is not as good as an elephant's tusk. It's not good. But it does not hold them back from being exceptional artists. I mean, Jackson Pollock at this age. Now, can you see me? Hear me? Yes, Holly? Okay, we're almost there. Excuse me. A young girl has just found Mayor Danica Bells dead outside, posed in a gruesome nativity scene. I think I have a guess as to what may have killed Mayor Bells. False alarm, um. - Back to you. - Yes. What's with the interrupting, about the death stuff again? - It's always about murders. - 'Cause now my heart rate is certainly up. You know what? This is why we love to share human interests and also hippo interest stories. Huh, no no no. Oh no. Daddy, daddy, I swear I saw her. You have to believe me. I think you've just had a little too much sugar tonight, honey. I believe you, Faith. You do? Holly thinks that all the blood and missing people could be the work of, Satan. It's true. Do you have any proof? Yeah, I have proof. I have a picture of a note written in blood, and you saw the vent, plus the van the other night. No, those are the same vaping teens who vandalized Goldman's place. They probably used cranberry sauce or something. It's not cranberry sauce. If you would test it you would see that. Okay, I'm gonna find Danica and put this all to bed. Faith, why don't you go lend a hand. Yeah, okay. Holly, you're freaking everyone out. Yeah, well we should be freaked out, Chris. Look, over the past few days, your Mayor cousin, snowman building Joy, those two nerdy baristas, and Aunt Becky have all vanished. It's Satan. Holly, I care about you. But the devil doesn't make baristas disappear for sport. And throwing around the S word, isn't good for Faith. She's sensitive. Because of her mother and the hot air balloon accident, I can't have anything happen to her. Especially something so, darn silly. No, Chris, I'm telling you. Look, I think it's best you find a new camera man. And a new man friend. Uh. I gotta go. We're not dating. Satan. I warned you, Holly. No depressing stuff. And, you cut off our painting hippo story. If you want that anchor cheese, you stick to the script and look relatable while doing it. So smile like crazy when you're with the kiddos tonight. Something is not right here and I want to solve why. Yeah, no solving, just smiling. Who was that? Just my bitch boss. He, like the rest of Ornaments, doesn't give a flying fudge that freaky stuff is happening in this world. I don't know. Maybe he's right, maybe, maybe I shouldn't either. Do you ever wear your hair down? I overheard your call. Oh no. If you want to be more relatable, may I? Sure. Okay. And now for the grand finale. Um. Have a holly jolly Christmas. You get it? Um, not a clue. Because your name is Holly. I'm kidding, Cook. It's amazing. Now get outta here so I can change into this masterpiece. Oh, hold on. Okay, it's not very Christmassy. No, it's for when you put on the sweater to protect your makeup and your curls. That's very weird. Okay. Hey, hey hey hey. Thank you. What's family for? Yay! Yay, yay, yay. Okay. Perfectly relatable. Okay, ready people. Three, two, show time. Everybody ready for some holiday cheer and magic? Okay Faith, open up your present. And, what did you get, little girl? Ooh, I think it might be raspberry jelly. Ooh. I think it leaked through. Wow. Okay, you can open up your presents now, too. Ah! Oh wait, it's uh. It's a foot. From a person. Is that, is that real? Holly. Are you having a stroke? Uh, yeah um. I think that maybe we should, uh, wrap this up. I'm uh. Thank you. I think, I mean. Put the fudging camera down, Chad! Oh my God, Cookie! She's not breathing! Someone call an ambulance! I can do CPR while we wait. Can I get the parents to grab their children and take them home immediately. That's an order. All of this it, it must have triggered her back to that Christmas morning. She's gonna be okay, right? She has to be okay. This is the same thing happened to your parents, isn't it? Yeah, Aunt Becky said they were found wrapped up like gifts under the Christmas tree. If the killer really is back, that means he went dormant for decades and came back right when you did. What are you saying, Noel? I'm saying it's a hell of a coincidence. I don't have time for this right now. I need to be with my sister. Chad, Chris, wait up. Hey. It's warm. Thank you. How you feeling? My brain's just trying to make sense of all this. You know I, I knew there was evil in the world, just not here in Ornaments. I mean not for a long time, at least. Now it's back and it's all my fault. No, you can't blame yourself, Holly. Maybe not for the letter that I wrote when we were kids, but the one the other night, I mean. I don't know. I always thought that the devil was just made up, you know? Like a mascot for the bad so that people wouldn't sin. An evil spirit that was just as fictitious as the one with the white beard that I thought I was writing to. Oy. It's my boss. Probably calling to fire my ass. Oh, you don't know that. Hm. I'll be fine. Just, I'm glad you're here with me. Okay, I'll, I'll be quick. Okay. Pretty crazy night, huh? More like crazy ratings. What? Your segment just went viral. Over three million views in just under an hour. Guess I was wrong, eh? People don't want feel good, they want darkness, blood and gore, so, come on, let's give it to 'em. That is disgusting. You are talking about people who lost their lives including my aunt. Listen, it's time to get back to investigative, Holly. Find out who's doing the kills. Who knows, you may end up getting poached by Fox News. I hope scouring the B roll will help us catch the killer. What if she's right? Holly, that it's um, Satan. I got a big fat bag of evidence. Seems to be some kind of a disguise. They found it behind Aunt B's. Got a brown wig. Camera, glasses. Bubble gum lip gloss. Animal print scarf and finally this, coral blazer. Well that's tangerine. Oh, holy night. It's definitely tangerine. There something about these items that look familiar to you? What are you keeping from me, Pringle? Those, those are Holly's things. What? Noel, there's no way Holly did this. Chris. Where is she now? Hands up! Oh oh oh! Deputy. Worst stripper gram ever. This isn't a joke. Noel told me what you did to those people. To our sweet little sister. What? Chad, what is going on here? Hands behind your back, Frost. Okay, okay, geez. You're under arrest for six homicides in Ornaments. What are you talking about? The bodies that were found tonight, all of your sister's personal belongings were there, Cookie. Covered in victim's blood. Oh, okay. Look, I'm obviously being framed. Cookie. No it was you, wasn't it? What? You killed mom and dad when we were little. What? All because they wouldn't buy you a Darby Dream Wagon. And then, and then you came back to do a news story so that you would be promoted. No! You're a psychopath! I would never do something like that. I love our parents, Aunt Becky, look, I love you. Yeah, yeah, and that's why you never, you know, came back to visit or send me a birthday card. Just hear her out, Cookie. No! The only person that you love is your drunk, demented, depraved big city self! Just take her away, Deputy. No, this, this is bullshit. Cole, I want a lawyer. You've got one. Passed the bar last fall. Cole, the courthouse doesn't reopen until after Christmas. She can stay with me in the meantime. She's a maniac, Pringle. She's crazy, she killed Joy. Uncuff her. Now. I hear we're having a slumber party? Yeah. Um, hey Chris. Thank you, thank you both, for coming to save me. We believe you, about Satan. Like you believed I wasn't seeing things in the manger. Yeah. Just, I wish my sister believed me. Hey, you can sleep on the couch, or in the master while I'm on the couch. Um guys, um that's not Santa, is it? Oh shit. Happy holidays. Chris! Oh, is there anything better at Christmas than a fallen angel. Dad! Help! Daddy, I can't feel my fingers! Don't like snow angels! Holly, save us! Let them go. You have done enough damage to this town and to my life! Oh, did I? Oh that's so sad. Screw this. You have a sweet tooth, honey? Be careful, you might get a little hippy. It's over, asshole. Oh, come on! You, you just blinded me. Oh, ow! Oh no, look at that, I'm totally fine. What do you want? What do I want? You wrote me, remember? You gave me Christmas. Which by the way, is a fabulous gift, sweetheart. I am having a ball. Get out of here, Holly! Run Holly! To my place! We'll be fine, just go quick. It is the most wonderful time of the year. Holly, it's us. Come in, come in. Oh my God, are you all right? I was so scared. Is that fiend gone? For now. Exactly. For now. We can't defeat Satan physically. Question is, is how? Let's just get you patched up first, okay? Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Are you sure you don't mind taking the couch? Oh, yeah yeah, no no, it's no problem. Thanks for everything this week, Chris. You've been, you've been so great. Especially considering all that crap that I put you through when we were younger. Holly, we're dealing with a holiday devil. Surviving together is all that matters now. So, why don't you dream of sugarplum fairies for me, okay? Okay. Oh um, um. No kissing, at least not this early on. Yeah, okay, cool. You know what, I, actually I get it. Um. How bout we high five instead? Uh, sure. Yeah? Sure. Okay. All right. High five. Um, goodnight Chris Pringle. Night Holly Frost. Hm. Let me guess. Santa's reindeer? I know it probably seems silly but, when I lost my mom to the hot air balloon, I became depressed. I needed to find faith to continue on. I mean, living in Ornaments, Santa seemed like a good start. I put these out every year and someone eats them. Sure, maybe it's my dad but, I like to think it's the reindeer. O-M-Gingerbread. What is it? If Satan is real, then who's to say that Santa isn't? I can't believe my lips are about to say this, but what if I wrote to Santa to ask his advice on how to get this horny hell raiser out of Ornaments? A, a letter to Santa! Yes! I'll get a pen. And I will get some liquid courage. Dear Santa. Hey, it's been 20, oh scratch that. 21 years since we last spoke. I need to bring back joy to Ornaments and take down Satan. How the, fudge, do I do that? Love, Holly Frost. Something's not right. Winters. It says Santa, right? Here goes nothin'. Now we just have to get it to Santa. Oh, but the bakery's closed tonight. I know what that look means. I have a plan, Miss Winters. Oh my God, Faith, is everything okay? Better than okay. What? I found this by my half eaten carrots. He wrote back. What? Santa's real. Open it, open it. Dear Holly, it's nice to hear from you. If you help a friend in need and find a song in your soul, you can light up the world. Ho ho ho, Santa. This is straight up gibberish. No. No, I think it's a riddle. I love riddles. Oh God, Santa wrote me a fudging riddle to abolish Satan? Okay, it looks like it's written in three different sections. So we should start at the beginning. If you help a friend in need. Do you have a friend in need? I don't have any friends. Except for Chad. Oh, hey. I'm glad you're not in the slammer. Hey, what's going on Uncle Chad? Why are you tossing out all those pretty pies. Well, everyone's afraid to leave their homes. They think Holly's a mass murderess, so Sheriff Noel canceled the rest of Christmas Wonder. Including tonight's caroling concert at the bakery. Holly, Santa said to find a song within your soul. Maybe Santa wants the concert to go on. I think that you're right. Ah, shit, he's early. Who? Who's early? Faith, makeover. Wow. Chad. You look different. I do? Uh, what are you doing here? Uh, your niece called, said there was an emergency. Faithy, what? Uh, John. Chad had something that he would like to ask you. I do? Mm-hm. Uh, maybe, would you like to go for a bite sometime? What took you so long, Chady? I thought you weren't interested. I thought you weren't interested. Aw. Okay, great. So you both like each other. Now we have to get back to saving Christmas. Chad, send an email blast to all of your customers. Tell them that the event her tonight is uncancelled. And, ah, everybody who attends gets free pie. I don't know if I have enough filling. Oh darling, I know a hot farmer who might have a few extra apples lying around. Hm, I'm on it. Wanna give me a hand, Chady? Sure. Okay. Okay Faith, now it's time to find Sheriff Noel. Tell him that he and the other carolers need to be ready to rock at seven o'clock. But, Sheriff Noel thinks you chopped up his sister. Right, okay, um. Tell him that if this doesn't work, he can arrest me. Now go, go, go go go. Go go go go go! Okay. Help a friend in need. Nailed it. The free pie is here, everyone. Hey, Sheriff. You ready to belt? Oh what is this, like Christmas charades? Look, I'm sorry, we do not have time for that right now. Sorry, do you think that I'm the Christmas killer? Hello? Uh, Noel and the other carolers came down with laryngitis? In the last two minutes? What are the odds, right? Ugh! Satan's the odds. I'd do it Holly, but I have a terrible singing voice. The concert's canceled, again. No, no no no no. Look, somebody has to, you know, like sing from the soul. And I think I know who that someone has to be. Hey everybody. Hi, hello. Can everybody hear me okay? We don't want to see or hear you, Christmas killer. Oh, okay, wow. Look, I'm here tonight desperate to bring back Ornaments' wonderful spirit, which Satan has stolen. The woman speaks the truth! Cookie, I've done a lot of thinking about how important family is. I mean, it's what Christmas time is all about. I've been a terrible little sister to you and I really hope that it's not too late for us. I need you to see. I need you all to see that people can change.

Thank you, Cookie. I love you. Say you'll come home. Stay for Christmas. I would like that, very much. But, I think that I'm, I'm gonna have to ask my cute lawyer. Oh my God! Oh no. It's Carol, from Carol's electronics. For real? It's Carol? I just saw her this week. It's like a new nightmare. Satan is toying with us. We have to keep the Christmas spirit in order to defeat that devil. I have a plan. It's on, bitch. Light up the world. Of course, daddy's tree lighting ceremony. You're a genius, Holly. There she is. Kevins, what are you doing here? Your friend Chad posted that video of your speech and song last night. Sorry I ever doubted you. That anchor job is your. Christie's already cleared out her dressing room. She cried, it was uh, pregnancy hormones. That's very kind of you, but, I mean not the Christie part, that's horrible, but I'm not interested. Look, there are more important things in the world than being Connie Chung. Oh, and Kevins, you're gonna want to film this. Okay. Chris, hey, Chris. Where's the rest of the town? Satan's gonna be here soon. Maybe they're just late. Or maybe I was just less convincing than we thought. We should get started. Yeah, okay. Evening, Ornaments. May be small, but we are mighty. Right? Okay, here goes nothing. We're ready for you, Satan! Yeah. Show yourself! Happy holidays! We can't let that demon ruin our joy, so let's light up this tree! One, two, three! It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Every one in the town is up there. That's why people didn't come to the ceremony. Alive. Santa's fix didn't work. Satan won. Woo! All because I couldn't fudging spell at seven? That's what he meant. The last part of Santa's riddle. You can stop this whole charade right now, Satan. Because we are not afraid of you. Are you sure, Frost? It's Winters again, dick. No one cares. I never meant to write you all those years ago. And we are taking back Christmas because it's ours. Yeah! Woo! It's rude to take back a gift, sugarplum. You were raised better than that. Oh no, wait a second, I totally killed your parents. Over the past few days, I have rediscovered the Christmas spirit. I believe in hot cocoa, candy canes, caroling, Christmas presents, ginger bread houses. I believe in snow men, snow women, snow theys. I believe in the goodness of people. I believe in love. But there is one thing that I do not believe in. And that's you. What? Time to light this mother up. No! No, no. No no no no! No! Think of Christmas wonder! Go, link arms! It's snowing in here! Oh my. Everyone's alive again. It's a Christmas miracle. You did it, Holly. We did it! I have something to confess. Oh, the leather's too much. You're dumping me. No, no. My real name is Johannes Strudel, and I'm the Prince of Mocano. You mean Monaco? No, Mocano. It's a small country in West Eastern Europe. I came to Ornaments to be ordinary. To plant apple trees. But, I have found my prince. I'm ready to go home. Will you marry me, Chady? Me? A prince's prince? Yeah. But, we've only been dating like one day. Yeah. What am I saying, I do. Every- I'm engaged! Kevins. Sam. All it took was having a little faith in Christmas. Hi. So, I'm like, I'm really sorry for getting you killed by the angel of darkness and for like being such an asshole. It's no sweat. Maybe we can try that van thing again. I'll take down my wife's posters and kittens. Yeah, um, I kind of. Holly? Chris, what? What is this? Hopefully it's not a hand. Something you deserved a long time ago. Oh my God. A Darby Dream Wagon? How did you know? A little Christmas birdie told me. Chris, it's perfect. Thank you. Whoa whoa, uh. We're still not gonna? I just, I thought, I thought maybe we were like in the final act, so. Uh. It's just, the next woman I do that with, I want to be the woman I marry. Are you ready to come home, be with me? Be a mother to Faith? Chris, I. I am ready to love. But, you're so not the one. I, I may have rediscovered the holiday spirit and the Christmas candle inside my heart but, that doesn't mean I want to be with somebody so, bland. Hot, like so, you're so hot. But I mean, bland. And I don't want to be anyone's mom. Like, ever, so. Yeah. Excuse me. Uh, Cookie, can you? Sure. Thanks. Thank you. Uh, where is that? Ah, not today. Ah, Goldman. Hey, I'm uh, ready for that dance now. And this. Woo, wow. Um, Danica, do you swing? Funny you should ask. We do. What do you say? God bless us, everyone!
