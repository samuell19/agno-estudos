So confident I'll go his way Whistle to him and the passing time My death waits like a bible truth At the funeral of my youth Weep loud for that and the passing time My death waits like a witch at night As surely as our love is bright Let's not think about the passing time But what ever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil, I don't care For in front of that door, there is you My death waits like a beggar blind Who sees the world through an unlit mind Throw him a dime for the passing time My death waits there between your thighs Your cool fingers will close my eyes Let's not think of that and the passing time My death waits to allow my friends A few good times before it ends So let's drink to that and the passing time But what ever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil, I don't care For in front of that door, there is you My death waits there among the leaves In magicians' mysterious sleeves Rabbits and dogs and the passing time My death waits there among the flowers Where the blackest shadow, blackest shadow cowers Let's pick lilacs for the passing time My death waits there in a double bed Sails of oblivion at my head So pull up the sheets against the passing time But what ever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil, I don't care For in front of that door, there is... you Thank You.

'THE WIDTH OF A CIRCLE', , DO ?LBUM 'THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD' In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know." So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello Who was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along) He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again" (Turn around, go back!) He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh David Bowie apresenta os membros do grupo.
