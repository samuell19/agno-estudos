It's beautiful. You know everyonealways talks about the unknown beingthis bad thing. Miracles have been in there too. A new port every day. A new adventure. And nothing good everhas to end. Why don't you tell me something I don't know aboutMiss Olivia Grayham. [laughs] No you tell me. You Googled me. Yeah. Or have you made upyour mind already? Because that's usually the case. I had my life handed to meon a silver platter and no matter how hard I trynothing will convince people that I've earned it myself. That is why you worktwice as hard. Yeah. I get it. When you come from nothingit always feels like a fight when you're trying to earnyour place. The grass is the same colouron both sides of the fence. I guess so. Ah wow, well I definitelyowe you an apology. For what? For making my mind up about you before even knowing you. You deserve this. You deserve all of it. You deserve it too. [phone rings] Oh hold on. Hello? [over phone] Tony. Ship to shore call for you. It's Shelly from corporate. I will be right there. Okay. Are you coming? Oh, no, I am gonna wait hereuntil everyone is fast asleep. Okay. I'll see you. Bye ♪ ♪ You better watch out or soonyou're gonna be obsolete. Hey hey don't think for onesecond the robot overlords aren't coming for your jobsomeday too. No, no, no. They would short out the Flow Rider. Yes. Called your room last night. You were out late. I wasn't out that late. You were with him, I knew it, you like him! Who him? Miles! No. The other him? I was working! It was work! Was it? Mmmhmm. Shipboard romance, man. You know how this story ends. Yeah. Sure if you say so. This is business! I am not here to find a boyfriend. I'm here to help you achieveyour dreams. So what! Make it a double whammy! I know you know how to multitask. You need to stop. I'm on a mission this week okay? I need no distractions. They're expecting Prestonto be here for the workout this morning. [gasps]Look! She's even wearing a FutureCooking Star shirt with Preston's face on it! Oh, the negative commentsl'm going to get on my website. Olivia I've been promotingthis for months. [breathes deep] Okay. Preston will be here. Just not today, right? I told you before, it's just a reshuffling of the schedule until he arrives. Okay. Okay. [Clears throat] Okay, so one woman just wentback to her cabin because she's not meetingPreston Smythe. She said she does not havethe energy to work out. That was not the intended goalfor this event. The guests are not happy Tony. We are fixing it. Not to worry, Paula. Good. We got this. Mhm. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Royal Caribbeanand Living Easy with Alexandra we just want to apologizefor this small setback however after the Alexandra3-5-7 workout I will be giving one on onepersonal training on the Flow Rider for anyonewho wants to learn how to surf in shark-freewaters. Huh? [applause and cheering] Alright I'll see you guysout there. Good luck. Thank you! Hey. Hey. Going in? I tried surfing once. I broke my throwing arm, so... In the water? That's how bad I was. Oof. Catch you later. [sighs] Penny for your thoughts? Oh. [laughs] I got a lot of them. It's going to cost youa lot more than a penny. Well, do you take credit cards? I just I had to get away. I hated lying about Preston. Don't think of it as lying. You're just withholding until the full picture falls through. That is a nice justificationand I'm going to use it. Okay. Thank you for everything. I forgot how much fun it wasto work with a team and really it's just been mewith my business trying to prove myself. To who? My ex, for one. He used me to get aheadand then I was expendable. Yeah, that's why when youput your trust in someone, you really think you that gota future with them and they betray you. Ooh, you speak from experience. You know that old story. Guy meets a girl while workingon a cruise ship, she gets a job dancingin a show, he gives up everything, lets it all go to follow her. Right as they're about to leavehe finds out that she doesn'twant him to come. That old story. I hate that old story, yeah. Yeah, me too. Fortunately my boss hadn't hireda new assistant so I was able to reversemy resignation. Why didn't she want you to come? I don't know. I guess she changed her mindabout me. About us, so. I'm sorry. No it's just crazy. I was going to give all of thisup for her. This really means a lot to me. Yeah, but you were in love. I mean, what's more purethan that? You know passengers comeon this ship every cruise and they are their best selves. No tablets. No phones. No emails. Away from everything. And it is my one job to makethem happy. That-that's pure. Yeah, but you deserve someoneto make you happy. Well, I get to touch a new groupof lives every single cruise. That's what makes me happy. [phone rings] Some people bring tablets. It's Preston. Preston hi! Where are you? Right. I can't make it. Wh-what? I thought I could but I had tofire the entire kitchen staff of my new restaurant. Can't get away. You understand. Hey! You! Get out of this kitchen anddon't put me on your resume! Cheers! No! I... hello? Okay. What now? I mean he actually said, "I'm sure you understanddon't you?" You know karma must have some pretty serious plansfor this guy. You know this main event? It's cancelled! It's over! I literally havethree binder tabs dedicated to thisand it's just a waste. I's okay, hey. We can't just give upthat easily. We'll fix this. We just gotta think outsidethe box. Together. Okay? Come on. Okay. What if... no, that's stupid. Oh! Oh! We... never mind. You know we are two intelligentresourceful individuals Olivia. I don't get it! Speak for yourself! My resources are taking a nap. This is a mess. Okay, I mean we couldalways do the mock episode ofFuture Cooking Star. How? Everyone's expectingPreston Smythe. [mocking British accent]Oh can you beat me at my own dish, I'm Preston Smythe. That's it! What? That's it! Preston Smythe! We have someone play Preston. Who? Me! This is serious! It's supposed to be the main event! Well, I am being serious! You haven't seen my impressions. They're really good. Okay, first Karate Kid, nowyou're a celebrity impersonator? Yes, among many other talentsthat will reveal themselves in the coming days. Okay, I can get behind this. So we have a plan. Let's go talk to Allie. Come on. Okay, so here's how it's goingto go down. I will play Preston. Alexandra you just be you, and we'll have a guest judge. Listen I love includingthe guests but... But? I'm a professional. They're going to pick meas the winner. Okay, so no offence Tonybut we're going to have to start with a levelplaying field. Okay, well then I as Prestonwill go up against Olivia as character-to-be-decided. Oh no I'm not comfortable- That's really cute! Do you know that Oliviaused to play Anita in West Side Storyin high school? Get out of here. I was Bernardo! Then you see? It's meant to be! Prepare to go downcharacter-to-be-decided! Okay, but listen I don't domy shows blind and Olivia could probablyuse a dry run. Yeah, let's do a dry run. I love it! I love it. Okay, this is fantastic. Let's meet back here first thingin the morning. Perfect. This is not happening. Okay, so every time I'm in frontof a crowd of guests I play a different character. My job is to allowother people to shine. Yes, yes, yes, I know but it'sabout time it was your turn. Uh huh. I think it's time that youchannel your inner Anita. Ah hah! I think she's still in there. Is she though? Bernardo Anita dance. Oh no, that was alla long time ago. It's like riding a bike. Come on! Whoa. Oh, okay. Okay. Or it's nothing likeriding a bike I'm gonna take my hand back. Yeah, sorry. Well, let's just pretendthat this is a performance, just a different kindof performance. Yes, exactly. You'll be fine, just be yourself. Okay. Or you can be someonecompletely different. Alright. Let's turn this onand we are rolling. We're rolling. Here we go guys. And... action. [In a British accent]Hello everyone. My name is Preston Smytheand I am angry. [laughs] That was your accent? I thought you had a bigold bag of tricks! A magician never revealshis secrets. Mmm, ok. Welcome to Future Cooking Star. Can you beat me at my own dish? [together] Yes we can! And today, Prestonis going up against... Maggie, um... [in a southern accent] Birwellof Nashville, Tennessee! Y'all better be careful becausel got a few tricks up my sleeve. That's right. Maggie and I are goingto be cooking my special dish Cordon Bleu. Oh, that's way too fancy for me. I say "Cordon Blue!" It's good. [laughing]What? I like to be authentic. Oh really. Me too. You know what? You know what? I'm going to steal this thingright out from under you. Huh, that sounds likea challenge and I never back downfrom a challenge. Oh, it's a challenge but are you sure that you're up to it? Oh, I know I'm up to it. You on the other hand... Well, you know what I haveto say to that? Mhm? Bring it on. Oh, it's already been brought. Okay! And this is how we makea great show you guys! [laughter] Here we go! Let's do this! Hi Mom! Hi honey! I set up everythinglike you asked. It's exactly the way yousketched it in your binder. Thank you for that. We have a lot of ground to coverfor the Cook-Off. Are you okay? I will be. If we can pull this off. It's just... I really want itto go right. I feel like I haven't had a lot go right in my life lately. You are being way too hardon yourself Livvy! You are juggling everythingso much better than you think you are. Embrace it sweetheart! You really like Wes, don't you Mom? I do. And I think you would too if you'd just give him a chance. Okay. [indistinct announcements] Thank you. Hey! By the way I am making thismy office the next cruise. If I get a next cruise. Ooh, thank you! And you will! And they're crazy if theydon't give you this ship. From your lips tocorporate's ears. I'm doing the best I canbut you just never know. I'm green so I guessit makes them nervous. You know what? Miracles exist in unchartedwaters. [laughs] What did you just do? It's time to adjust. I want to start fresh. Okay. So changes this lateto date? Oh you can't be so rigid! You have to be willingto bend a little! Oh, okay. And you are well on your wayto that redemption you seek. Redemption. I don't think I wantthat anymore. I've just been holdingonto all this stuff. And my ex is stillthe general manager and I'm not even a blipon his radar anymore. What would make you happyright now? Right here, right now? What would make you happy? To be able to just let itall go. Well, you can. And I know exactly what to do. Come on! Oh, wait! Come on. Wait. You are going to love this. Well, I hope. I don't know. There's not a lot of risk-takingin my family. Well, your mother does. Yeah, now she does butthat was never the case. Oh! That's right because you area Grayham. Yes! Yes! And I was raised to avoidunnecessary death! All death is unnecessary. This, however, is completelysafe and ridiculously fun. Sure okay I just um... Oh, come on, didn't you want to let it all go? Hmm-mmm. So leave the old cautiousOlivia and Ben and all thosehotel jerks behind? Leave them at the beginningof the zip line and just sail across the skyinto a brand new Olivia who is untethered by her past. Hmm-mmm. You know what, when you get to that other side all this stuff? It'll be behind you for good. I did this when Eve left meon the ship. It works. Wait. Wait wait wait. You're not coming? Oh no. I'm going to be waiting for youon the other side where you will subsequentlystart your new beginning. Woo! Okay I can do this. Here goes nothing. No. Here goes everything. Okay. Woo! Oh my goodness.

Looks like you're lostin thought. Yeah. Are you okay? Um, no actually. I'm not. Why are you with my mom? Well, she's beautiful and smartand really kindhearted. And rich? You know I was the partnerat a law firm for 30 years. My wife died and I didn't want to practice law anymore. I got a golden parachute. I'm fine financially. This isn't aboutyour mother's money. I never thought thatthis would happen again but I love your Mom. When we were at portl saw you walking with another woman. I saw you. That's an old law partner'sdaughter. She's here with her husbandand her little baby. I just want my Momto be happy. It was so hard for her aftermy dad died and she's having so much fun on this tripand I see her with you but I just need to know that she is going to betaken care of and loved. I need to know that. She will be. Okay. [laughing] Tony is really good. He's really good! He's great at the Flow Rider. Wow. Oh, my goodness. What a beautiful night. It is a beautiful night. Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. The last time Miles was surfinghe broke his arm. Oh, well I guess he's steppingup his game for you. Hey! Hi! Oh no! Well, it was a noble effort. I'm okay, I'm okay. I don't know who you are Preston but you are going down! If you beat me, I'm angry. If you don't beat me, I'm still angry. Can you beat me at my own dish? [audience yells together]Yes, we can! I'm gonna be the firstto beat Preston and if I don't y'all got someexplaining to do. Alright judges for the moment of truth, now to confirm you did not knowwhich dish was Maggie's or which one was Preston, correct? Awesome.

It's my job to worry. Okay. I got a plan. Yep. Is it robots? No. Is it robots? No. Even better. It's robots isn't it? Alright we are tiedfor the championship. Table 27 you guys rang inwith Bette Davis which was the incorrect answer. Now Table 24 you guys cansteal this for the win! Now tell me, which charactersaid the line, "Fasten your seatbelts." "It's going to be a bumpy ride." Olivia Grayham! You seem very confidentthat you know the answer. Table 24! Margot Channing! That is correct! [cheering] I knew it! You guys are the champions! Congratulations! I asked for the character, not the actress. Margot Channing, All About Eve, Table 24 that isthe correct answer. Congratulations, you guysare champions! Woo! You know whatthis reminds me of? Dad! Every Sunday! Board games and picnics. Oh, we got very competitive. Especially your father. Maybe that's a traditionwe start again. That sounds likea wonderful idea. It sounds like he wasa lot of fun. He was. Hey um, would any of you likea drink or a glass of wine? I'm going to go grab itat the bar. Oh, I'll take a wine. I'm okay, thank you. Thanks. He's such a nice guy. Yeah, he's uh-he's nice! But? There's always a but. I don't know I just don't thinkthere's a spark You have to give it time Livvy. It's brand new!

I can't eat peanut butter. It closes up my throatand I could die. Not the answerthat I was expecting. Yeah. You are a man of many talents. Well, I can say the sameabout you, except for the man part, obviously, that's weird. I can't eat parsley. I get hives. That's... Yeah. I break out. That's weird. It's bad. It was impressive. The way you ralliedwhen Preston didn't show? I'm putting that in my article! What? Yeah. A sort of "at sea anythingcan happen" angle. I feel good about this. I feel good about this! Ugh. It's these clubs. Probably. I did have a lot of help. Look, you were the star. Not him. You like her. [laughs] She's getting off, I'm staying on man. I've been there, done that. So what? It doesn't change the factthat you actually like her. Like a lot more thanyou're willing to admit. You're incredible! I don't know. I just kind of like being a little more behind-the-scenes. The best thing that could happenwas Eve leaving without me. It showed mewhat I really want. This ship. I'm not going to let anyone oranything get in the way of that. Alright man. Whatever floats your boat? Ship. It's a ship. It's a ship. I'm going to go again. I know you like to bebehind the scenes but I'd love a photographof you for this article. Really? I want to showthose people at the Grayham Hotelwhat they're missing. I mean, look at this place. It's got everything. It's great. This ship is amazing. It's really amazing. I really have to get back to my Mom. Oh, okay. But you have a reallyamazing night. You too. Bye. [exhales] You know, I was actuallydreading this cruise. Really? Yeah. I mean, the magazinenever pays for a guest and lately I've been feelingkind of lonely. But running into youand your gang, it's been fun, I'm having a blast. They're a really good gang. Hey listen, maybe oncewe get back to dry land we could try dinner again? Just you and me. I mean what a coincidence right? That you come on this cruiseand you reconnect with somebody who always made you wonderwhat might have been. That's a coincidence that cannotbe ignored in my book. You don't have to answer meright now. Just think about it. See you tomorrow. You sure do love high places. I do all my best thinkingwhen I'm up high. What are you thinking about? Well, I'm thinking that besidesa few minor setbacks and being under a microscope, I had a really good cruise. I am always emotional. I feel like for the first timein my life I'm finally on solid ground. How ironic because we'rein the middle of the ocean [laughs] I guess we both had thingswe had to put behind us. Walls that needed to bebroken down Issues to overcome. Bags to store in the overheadcompartment. Maybe we finally made itto our destination And then, well, um... he kissed me. He kissed you? We got caught upin the moment. Hold on. But he kissed you?! Would you just shush! My Mom is right there. The last thing I want is herasking me more questions. I mean what's the point? We get off this ship in a coupledays and he stays on board so... So. You finally open yourself up and the guy is geographicallyunavailable. So you kissed her. I knew it man. You like her. Okay, but it's not feasible. You have a month offbetween contracts dude Not when I'mthe cruise director I haven't seen you like somebodylike this since... Whoa. What does it matter? Listen you are only unavailableif you choose to be. Why do you choose to be? Maybe because I finally feellike I'm home? And if I give all this up andthat doesn't work out then what do I got? Nothing. Want some bartender advice? Have a drink. You seem stressed out. I'm going to work. I'll see you later. Yeah. And lastly judges Beckyand I made my special buffalo chicken potato saladin 15 minutes I might add, so who's it going to be? Becky, John or Fiona? It's a three-way tie! Everybody wins! [applause and cheers] And thank you so much for coming and making my firstLiving EasyAt SeaCruise so incredible. So now, let's eat. Okay, but before everybody goes if you could please fill outyour comment cards we would love yourconstructive criticism. Yes, but if you loved it, feel free to mention that too. Multiple times if you want to so that way I can comeagain next year. Thank you. [applause] There are a ton of disappointedguests in the dining room. They didn't know this had moved. I put notes undereveryone's doors. Yes, but you have to goabove and beyond, Tony. You make announcements. You track people down. I don't know. Maybe corporate was right. You're not ready. Hey. Hey, you knowthat's not your fault. I should have said something... No, you know I did my best, that's all I can do, and I amtired of trying to win her over. Look at me. You are great and if she doesn't see that, that's because she's crazy. I have one day left. Let's just enjoy every minuteof it. Okay. Okay. [Sigh] This trip went so fastbut what a great time. You know, Wes isa good guy Mom. You two lookreally good together. I really appreciateyou saying that. What's on your mind Livvy? One very handsomecruise director perhaps? What am I supposed to do, mom? See him once a week for threehours in between cruises? It's definitely a complicatedscenario. But at least I'm happy to see that you're openingyour heart again. Am I though? Or did I just let him inbecause he was easy and safe? Because I knew this hadan expiration date? Because there's Mileswho's a good guy, he's nice and he lives near meand I am completely unsure. Then it looks like you haveto ask yourself what would make you happy? Who would make you happy? And then you have to leap. Don't forget to put your bagsout tonight, honey. I have to say my favourite partof the job is just meeting peoplefrom all over the world. So many different languages. I'm learning a lot everywhere... Uh, yeah, and I gotta say that my French is probably my favourite. Buenos Dias muchachos! Buenos Dias seniorita. Hola! What is it about waterthat makes it so soothing, huh? That it has no rough edges, just kinda flowsthe ways it flows. I think we could all benefit from being a little bit morelike that. You seem different thanwhen you first got here. Yeah, yeah, I feel likewhen I got on the ship just this old phaseof me ended and I'm on the vergeof something I'm just not really sure what. What you're on the vergeof is huge success! And this articleand the response to all the live videos are goingto do wonders for you. I know. I just don't really knowif I want that anymore. Olivia that's crazy. This is your business. It's what you've beenworking for. Don't let anyone change that. Oh, no, I'm not, it's just, what's the point? If it doesn't make you happy, you even said so yourself, you're tired of moving. Yeah, but I was just venting. Like I said, I preferthe creature comforts. Look, sometimes we haveto sacrifice just for a little stability. I guess I just want to be a partof something bigger than me. Find a place that I belong. Look. I've watched you on this cruise. I see the way you lookat that Tony guy but it doesn't make sense. You and I, we make sense. We live near each other. We have similar interests. We know we get along. You got past whatever you gotpast this week with him and that's great. We're getting off this ship soon. Let's get off together. Because that makes sense. I think you're so great. I just, I need time to justfigure out what this new me is. Well, if you ask me, I don't think there neededto be a new you. Paula! Hi I've been looking for you. Olivia, is everything alright? I don't want to tell you how to do your job but there's something I needto show you. Alexandra's comment cards. Oh. I'll take theseunder consideration. Thank you. [knocking on door] Hey. Hey Tony. Alright, so I am wise enoughto admit when I am wrong. What are you talking about? I put some unfair expectationson you. I know how tricky an eventscruise can be and if that is your first one, maybe, maybe I'm the onewho should have bent a little. I really appreciate yousaying that. And I just heard backfrom corporate. They're willing to offer youa six-month contract to start. The Harmony of the Seasis yours, if you still want it. Uh yes, yes! Wow. I want this. This is where I belong. I, um, thank you. You're welcome. And congratulations Tony. [exhales] Hey! Tony! There you are. I've been looking for you. Last day. It's been busy. You okay? Yeah. I'm great actually. I got the job. You're looking at the newcruise director. That's amazing. I'm so happy for you. Yeah, yeah I guess we both endedup being winners this week huh? I got the ship, you gota brand new start. Maybe you can even goto your father's hotel with a handsome reporteron your arm. Show your ex. I really hope you can showthem all, Olivia. What are you talking about? You and Miles. I mean you guys lookamazing together. I'm really glad that you foundwhat you were looking for. That's what I wantfor all my guests. I want them to leave refreshedand renewed. Is that what I am to you? Just a guest? What else would you be? Must be pretty convenientfor you. Always making connections, one cruise at a time. Always sailing around but neveractually arriving anywhere. Thank you Tony for helping mefind me. I hope that one day you can stopsailing and you can arrive because that's when you're gonnafind where you really belong. That's when you'll get home. And on behalf of RoyalCaribbean and the Harmonyof the Seas crew we thank you for sailing with usand we truly hope to see you again as we sailto many destinations around this world. And I hope you enjoyedyour vacation as much as I enjoyed beingyour cruise director. We good? Yes. You're gonna like this. Thank you. [chuckles] Hey. Hope you hada good cruise. Oh! I was just coming to find you. Do you have a minute? Of course. I have an idea and we probably have to run itthrough corporate. It's your ship now Tonyand I'm all ears. Okay. Great. Let's go. So. [knocking] Olivia? Hey. Did they already check out? Olivia hey, it's Tony again. Please call me even if you'vealready disembarked which you probably have because everybodyhas except a few stragglers. I need to talk to you. It's important. Do you like what you see? Her beauty takesyour breath away. I don't think I'll ever get usedto calling a ship her or a she. As much as I love this ship, I wasn't actually talkingabout her. You know, no one's ever peggedme the way you did, Olivia. Ever. Maybe it's because we're alike. It's crazy. You walked on to my ship and you somehow changedeverything for me. How so? You made me rethinkabout where I belong. Someone once told me thatbelonging is not necessarily about the where, but it's about the who. Me with you. This is where I belong. I have an idea and I want to run it by you. Just sort of a way that we could have our cake and eat it too. We just spent thiswhole cruise eating and you want me to thinkabout cake. I think you're really goingto like this idea. Okay? Yeah. Good evening ladiesand gentlemen, welcome aboard Harmonyof the Seas. I am your cruise directorTony Rievas. And I am Olivia Grayham, the group coordinator, and it is my pleasureto welcome you all aboard to this Murder MysteryLovers Event cruise! Woo! [cheers and applause] So sit back, relax and enjoyyour time with us. Here we go.
