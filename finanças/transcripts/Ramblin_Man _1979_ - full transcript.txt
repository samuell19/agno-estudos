[music playing] THEME SONG: I'm breaking loose. I'm breaking loose. I'm breaking loose. Honey, I'm breaking loose. I'm breaking loose, running free. The open road keeps calling me. And my soul is restless and my feet just can't be still. I don't know where I'm bound, but I know I'm bound to ramble around. And chase to this whole life until I've had my fill. Well, ain't no telling where tomorrow's gonna find me. Maybe riding some old boxcar or sneaking out in the rain. I might strike it rich in California, then lose it all on the east coast in a loaded poker game. [inaudible] It don't matter where I go or what I'm, doing, because I plan to go and do it all before I'm through. Well, I'm gonna drink all the beer, love all the girls, see a great piece of this world. Look out, this cowboy's breaking loose. Lookout, this cowboy's breaking loose. MAN: I'm going to have to open at $5, boy. MAN 2: All right. Go. Cards. Give me one of your better cards, please, sir. DEALER: Card? Give me two. Check. One. Dealer two. I'll be $20. Your $20. $50 more. Call. Well-- well, I'm light $50, but I'm good for it, OK? You ain't got it, get out. Will, give me $50. Nope. Give me $50, Will. Now listen to me JD, please. The bus fare to Hollywood is $62.80 and that don't leave no gambling money. Will, give me $50. You want to walk to California? JD: Give me $50, Will. Come on. JD calls and JD has got a full house. A straight flush? Yeah, I guess I got lucky. Threw two cards to straight flush? That happens sometimes, mister. What about that card between your feet? Didn't you like that one? Yeah. I wonder how that got there. Anytime you feel like jumping in here and helping me out. Sure. You're doing just fine. JD: Will! Well, I thought you were just going to let him kill me. Hold it right there, young fella. Well, I don't guess you've had enough, have you? All right. Do you want us to go out and call the local sheriff? Save yourself a dime. Take the big one first. [gun shots] Wanna go back in there? For what? I don't know, but I reckon he will. Now, that just doesn't seem like the smart thing to do, JD. You mean we're going to let him get away with that? I didn't say that. Come on. [laughter] Did you see the face on that cowboy when you drew the gun on him? Yeah. Run all the way to California. What's your count now? OK. Let her rip. [horn honking] That's my wrecker. They're taking my wrecker. Knock off! Knocking on it. Come on, yes! Woo-hoo. [laughter] [laughter] All units. All units. Listen here, this is the sheriff talking. Come in. Come in, anybody. Come on. RADIO: Come in, anybody. All units. This is the sheriff talking. Ready, boss. Bubba, I got two warthogs on Route four heading for the old McDaniel site in a wrecker. You stop them, you hear me? You want I should book them for speeding? Speeding? They've done an aggravated assault on a police officer, stole a vehicle, damaged property, destroyed county equipment, and attempted murder. Now, you block them out on that road, do you hear me? Yes, sir. [music playing] [police siren] [laughter] Won't that thing go any faster? Well, it will if I can get it in gear. [police siren] There they are. I'm going to shove them one at a time up that wrecker's exhaust pipe. [police siren] Hey. Is that a siren I hear? That or an air raid. You don't think they've got a [inaudible] us, do you? Oh, no. Probably having an attack of conscience. Want to give us our money back. [police siren] Hold in on them. Hey, I hope you've got a plan, JD, because I'm plum out of ways to save your butt. Aw, this is my plan, son. [police sirens] That's not a plan, brother. Hang on. [train whistle] [laughter] WILL: You ain't out of the Cs yet? No. You still plan on reading all the books in the encyclopedia? Mm-hmm. Well, you're going to be 80, bald, and toothless by the time you get through. Maybe but there won't be a smarter 80, bald, and toothless old goat in America. Well Will, I ain't putting down your learning, but there's a lot me and you got to do with our lives, son. We still got several years left before we're staring at 80. I know. But I mean a million things. Man, we've got to bull dog some steers at Madison Square Garden. Drive us an 18-wheeler from Maine to Alaska. We're going on them shrimp boats down in Mobile bay. Pour some steel up in Ohio. Drink all the beer and love all the women. It's going take a long time, son. And even when we get our gut-full, see-- we'll find a lady that looks like Venus de Milo, cooks like Mama, and then we'll settle down and have young'uns a piece. What do you think? We do half of that, we won't live to be 80. Yeah, but what a way to go. I love it. Hey. [train whistle] Well, this ain't at all the way we had it planned, is it? I mean, we was going to leave that ranch in Montana, and we're going to travel all over the country. We're going to see all places we've ain't never seen. Did you know there was more than one queen of Egypt named Cleopatra? And the famous one, she was all set to marry one brother and she went and poisoned another brother. First stop, Hollywood. Plenty of work, a lot of sunshine. Oranges right off the trees. All them pretty legs walking around. Man, that Cleopatra-- she got this Anthony to commit suicide by making believe she already killed herself. Now, we ain't going west. We're heading east. And neither one of us got the foggiest notion where we're going. And for your information, Will Eubanks, we got $18.60 between us and a vagrancy charge. And I'm cold and hungry. My stomach feel like a gas factory. Get the light out of my eyes. I just wanted to see the tears. JD, come alive. Huh? Where are we? We are where you want your ashes scattered when the grim reaper takes you. Are you funning me? Oh. We're at the one place you know more about than any cowboy living or dead. Hot damn. We're in Nashville, Tennessee. Music city, USA. WILL: Oh, here comes trouble. Morning, fellas. Morning. You want I should knock your heads here or take you someplace else to do it? Well Will, I guess this is the end of my dream, son. But you tried, and least I'll go out happy. You see, mister, I'm a sick man. And all I wanted to do was see Nashville before I passed on. You look pretty healthy to me. Well, it's one of them-- it's one of them creeping diseases, you see. It don't even show up till it's ready to kill you stone dead. I mean, how long did the doc give me, Will, old buddy? Six weeks? - Right about that. I got a notion you'll outlive me. But I admire a man who can tell a lie as big as that without blinking. Now, get. Well sir, a sick and dying man should salute you. You are a mess, JD. Do you know that? Yeah, but I naturally got to charming. Charm will not fill your gut. Now, we better find a YMCA, dump our gear, and start looking for a job. That's a good idea, but first we got to call Lonnie. Lonnie who? Don't remember Lonnie Grimes? Two weeks ago, Kansas City, chiefs and a Viking? He was drunk for two days, JD. He won't remember us. His exact words were, "if you get to town, call me." He gave me his phone number. There it is. People are always saying that, JD. And hoping you'll forget it. The trouble with you, Will Eubanks, is you ain't got no faith. Now give me a dime. Let's find a phone. No. No. [phone ringing] Hello? JD (ON PHONE): Uh, hello, Lonnie Grimes? Yep. Uh, Lonnie, this is JD Reed. Remember, you met me and my buddy, Will, at a football game a couple weeks ago? And, uh, you told us if we're ever in town to call you, and here we are. Oh, we got blind for two days. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you remembered us, Lonnie. Oh listen, I'm sorry I'm going to miss you guys. I'm going to be out of town for a couple of days. I got an idea, PJ. No, no, no, no. It's JD. JD and Will. Right. Why don't you guys stay at my place while I'm out of town? I got a sweet little 'Vette you can drive, too. Oh, well, that's great Lonnie. Thank you. Thank you. Oh and listen, do me a favor, will you? Pick me up a package while I'm gone? JD (ON PHONE): I'd be glad to. Yeah. Well, take this down now. JD (ON PHONE): Wait. I'm writing it down. Uh-huh. OK. Yeah, I got it. I got it. Thank you, Lonnie. Now, you make yourself at home and have a real good time. OK. Bye. He didn't remember us. Wrong. Wrong. As a matter of fact, he said we can stay at his digs. He's leaving town for a few days. And not only that, we can use this car. What's the catch? No catch, my boy. That's called southern hospitality. Now, he wants us to run a little errand for him, and then we'll get on over there. Come on let's, go. Get your bag. [music playing] Well, good life, here we come. Here. Hold on to that. I'll get the cab. Cab. Come on, you old fart. OK. They picked up the package. [music playing] What are you thinking? Well, I'm thinking a shot of B12, and four dozen horses, and I'll just come down here and kill myself. What we've got to do is we've got to get us a couple of bathing suits and-- Ooh. Ooh-wee. Would you look at this. Hey, Chief. Where's the piano player? - Shoot. - I ain't believe it. Look at that couch. It'll take you all week to sit on that thing, Will. Shoot. Lonnie done got him a play house. That's what Lonnie got. Look at that kitchen, Will. Where's the bedroom? I want to see the bedroom. JD, look what I found. JD: Hey, come here and look what I found. This guy ain't even use this encyclopedia. Well, he's used this bedroom. Come in here and look. Now, you talk about eating high on a hog. Get a load of this. Wow. What do you think? Hey, and look at this here bath. Come here. Look at this bathtub. Shoot. Do you believe in that? Woo. I'll toss you for who goes first. Will, you can get the Dallas Cowboys in that bathtub, or their cheerleaders, or both of them. I wonder where the diving board is. [door bell] [door knocking] [music playing] [laughter] Hello? Hello, anybody home? JD: Get in the bathtub. I'm so sorry. I rang the doorbell, but no one answered and-- and it was open so-- - No harm done, ma'am. - No. No harm done. Make yourself at home. What can we do for you, huh? I want you to help me find my sister. I don't rightly understand, ma'am. Well, I got a wire last week saying that my sister Carla had died. And then when I got here, well-- no one here seems to know anything about Carla. Not the police, or the hospitals, or even the funeral home. I mean no one. There now, ma'am. Don't cry. I'm sorry. It's just that we were so close. I'm only a couple of years older than Carla and after our folks passed away we sort of brought each other up, you know? Do you have sisters? I don't know, ma'am. Well, I haven't given up hope. I-- I guess it could be somebody's idea of a cruel joke. She was just so sweet and trusting and-- oh, I worried about her when she came down here to Nashville all by herself. And now I just don't know what to do anymore. Ma'am? Uh, Miss? Mrs. Mrs. Harper. Kate Harper. Well, we sure do feel for you, Mrs. Harper. Ain't that right, JD? But why are you telling us all this? Well, because a private investigator is my only hope now. That seems like a reasonable idea, ma'am. But I still don't know what you're-- Lonnie Grimes? What's he do for a living? Oh. Kate-- that's why he's out of town. He's a private investigator. Ma'am, we just ain't the people you think we are. No, the phone book said you specialize in missing persons. JD, could you explain it to her? Ma'am, I just got to get out of this frock. I feel stupid. Excuse me. What? Explain what? Well, uh-- you see, Will is a sensitive man, and it tears him up kind of bad-- the way he cries. What he wanted me to tell you was-- KATE: Oh, please. You've just got to help me. Look, I've got $1,000 with me, but I could get some more. $1,000? $1,000? Well then, I'm going to listen to what you got to say. [music playing] Is this your sister? Yeah. KATE: I was always what you'd call the brainy type. But-- well, Carla had that angel face and a sweetness that went with it. Well, I'm afraid it takes a little more than good looks to make it in the music business, huh? I mean, even Dolly Parton's got to have a voice to go with her-- you know, her good looks. Well, Carla had a voice. She had a real good voice. She was only here a few months before she got a demo record, and then she won an amateur contest, and did some club dates. And well, there was even some talk about a record contract. Then came that telegram from the Barnaby man. Barnaby? Who's Barnaby? Oh, he's the man who runs the Country Music wax museum. That's where Carla worked for a while when she first got into town. I called over there. Talked to his wife. She said he never even sent a telegram. She hung up on me. I called back three times. Three times she hung up on me. But I can give you another $1,000 just as soon as you find out what happened to her. Well, I'll tell you what. We'll do everything we can possibly do. Now, you go back to your hotel room and you relax, and we'll call you if we come up with anything. OK? - OK. - OK. JD, um, you will hold onto that picture, won't you? It's the only one I got. I sure will. Now you take care now. - OK. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. JD, come see this. - What is it? - Look at this. Why would a fella be doing the set up like this in his bedroom? Well-- the trouble with you, Will Eubanks, is you've led too sheltered a life. Now get your clothes on. We've got some work to do. What kind of work? Well, we're going to help that poor girl find her sister. Why should we? That's why. You shouldn't of told her we're detective, JD. It ain't honest. What, a $1,000 and all we got to do is find out what happened and we get another $1,000? But we ain't detectives. Well, neither is Jack or anybody else. But I bet you they pay him $100 a day to pretend they are. JD, you're going to end up filthy rich or in jail. Look, we ask a couple of questions. We'll get a couple answers. We find out what happens. Miss Harper goes back to New York happy. Well, at least not quite as unhappy. Now, where's the car? Wow. I'm looking for Grimes. Holy smoke, look at that. Shoot. Where are we going? To the Wax Museum, my boy. [music playing] You tell everybody we're detectives. That's a lie. It ain't no lie. It's a fib. There's a big difference. Everybody fibs. I don't if I can help it. Well, you can't help it, so come on now. And don't worry. Politicians fib all time, and they run the country. And that's George Jones, and that's-- Will, that's-- that's him. Howdy. Are you the manager? The manager? No. That ain't the manager. That's the king of country music, Will. Now, Mr. Acuff-- - Yeah. - My name is JD Reed-- - JD. And this is my friend, Will Eubanks. And boy, I can't tell you how tickled I am to see you. This is a pleasure meeting you, gentlemen. Both of you. Where do you think we ought we to put this, Mr. Acuff? Just lay it down on the little bench there, darling. That'll be all right. Excuse me, ma'am. I'd like to talk to the manager. What about? About Carla Wade. Is that the little blonde that used to work with you? Well, she's a lovely lady. My husband's in his office. He's right back though there. Thank you. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, Will. Mr. Acuff, could I have your autograph? Sure you can. You've got a paper? No, sir. But you can just write in my hat there. Oh, I and write in the hat. Sure. I've written in them before. Now you know I've got one of your yo-yos? You left it on the stage in Pawnee, Oklahoma. Pawnee, Oklahoma? I won it from a dude in a crap game. Did you? I turned down $40 for it. - $40? - I sure did. Listen, if there's anybody else out there that wants a yo-yo for $40, me and you are going into business. I'll get you a whole truckload of them things. All right. So you got the deal. I'm here to tell you, Carla was one of the finest, sweetest kids you'd ever hope to see. Was? I mean, when she was here she was. I suppose she still is. Then how come you sent that telegram to her sister? What telegram? I didn't even know she had a sister. JD, this Mr. Barnaby. He remembers Carla. Thinks a lot of her. Hello, Mr. Barnaby. So did Roy. How did Carla come to leave? She had it in the head to be a star. Had to be. But while she worked here she sold tickets, helped my wife with the wax figures, helped me with the books-- that sort of thing. But Carla decided to move along after she made that demo record. Now, did you have a chance to hear it? I hoped to tell you. The fact of the matter is she is such as treasure, my wife and I set up a session for her. Sort of like a present, you know. [music playing] Here's a copy. She was a pretty thing. That morning she got herself all decked out. And she stood there in that studio just like an angel child. [music playing] [singing] Make it through the night. Let me be your baby. Tell me it'll be all right. Let me be your baby. Tell me it'll be all right. MR. BARNABY (VOICEOVER): You'd of thought we'd given her a million dollars instead of that little bit that session cost. Oh, you angel. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh listen, if anything comes of this, I owe it to all of you two. A week later, she just up and quit. Hadn't seen her since. For a while, she'd call me my wife. And then we stopped hearing. Do you have any idea where we could find her? No. But if you do, you tell her she's got friends that would like to see her, you hear? You mind if we hold on to it? - It's yours. - Thank you, Mr. Barnaby. You've been a real help. Thank you. Well, I see he gave you her demo. Yes, ma'am. Did he tell you what a sweet, virginal little saint she was? He seemed right fond of her. Well, that's where you're smarter than I was. You could tell how he felt about her right off, couldn't you? I had to walk in on that record session to find out. She was a tramp-- that's what she was. A two-faced, hypocritical little tramp. [music playing] [singing] Make it through the night. Let me be your baby. Tell me it'll be all right. Let me be your baby. Tell me it'll be all right. MRS. BARNABY (VOICEOVER): A friend of mine told me my husband had put up $1,000 for that demo session. Baby doll, you were terrific. I'm going to make you the biggest star in this here town. And I'm going to do a few things for you, too, you animal. MRS. BARNABY; I came down there too late to stop it, but in time to catch them. I fired her on the spot. Ma'am, you ain't exactly tell it like your husband. My husband is a damn liar. You know, Will, I don't believe a word that woman said. Do you believe her husband? Well, no. Not necessarily. But Roy Acuff liked her, and I'd believe him if he said the world was going end tomorrow. [music playing] [gun shots] [car honking] WILL: You see who's place we tore up? JD: Yeah. Well, look at it this way. We don't have to call the cops. [music playing] [music playing] Lt. Blocker, we ain't bums or nothing. We're just a couple of guys from Montana who've dreamed all our life about coming to this town. About seeing all this beautiful country and these down-home friendly folks. We love Nashville. As a matter of fact, I was telling Will-- Don't try conning me, mister. You're talking to the wrong man. I'm from Philadelphia. I'm not from Nashville. And the only reason I'm here is because my girl is married here, and I don't like their husbands. And I don't like country music. And I don't like southern accents. Well, no offense. I-- Or good old boys, or grits, or moonshine. But most of all, I don't like concrete cowboys that drift from town to town raising hell. I'm going to lock you up. Huh? I don't think the law will let you lock us up, if you don't mind my saying so. Listen, I know what the law will or will not let me do. You can show me the law we just broke, OK, you lock us up. But don't forget the doctrine of culpability. Hey, that sounds like a good one. Tell him what that means. WILL: It relates to a situation where a person confronted by overwhelming pressure makes a choice between two evils. You mean, like should we get ourselves shot or should we run into a wall, right? That's right. A man cannot be held punishable should his life or liberty be in jeopardy. It's all there in the C's. Civil, common, criminal law. He's into C's now. It's all this pressure on his mind. Get out of here, and make sure I don't ever see either one of you again. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I don't know why you want to go honky tonking, Will Eubanks, but it's fine with me. Let's [inaudible] this picture again, will you? All right. And what do you see? An awful pretty girl. No, behind her. The sign. Alley Cat Amateur night, right? Right. And where are we? We're in Fray's Alley. What's that sign say? Alley Cat Club. Oh, right. I'll make a detective out of you yet. Come on. Oh, saw it, son. Hey, well, Ray Stevens is here tonight. [applause] [music playing] [singing] Yeah, they come down Main Street drums a-flailing and sirens a-wailing-- what a roar. Bands are a-playing, and flags are a-waving, and the vanguards and motorcycles go. Clowns looked around into the crowd and pinching every pretty girl who dares to smile. It's a glorious mess. Everybody wears a fez. The parade stretches out for a while. It's a typical American phenomenon where all the members have a fine old time. It's the 43rd Annual Convention of the Grand Mystic Royal Order of the noble job, the Ali Baba Temple of the Shrine. [laughter] Hello, operator? Give me room 321, please. Thank you. Hello? Noble Lumpkin? This is the illustrious potentate. I said, it's the illustrious potentate. The illustrious-- Coy! Dad blame it, this is Bubba. [laughter] Why ain't you at the parade? What? How's you'd get that thick Harley up there in your room? [laughter] [singing] Well, it was all erased by the Ladies Auxiliary in the downtown convention hall. Cold roast beef, string beans, mashed potatoes, and nine boring speeches and all. And all the tables looks fine with the Mogen David wine and chrysanthemums on each side. And the Hahira leaders, in their rented tuxedos made the local hearts swell with pride. It's a typical American phenomenon where all the members have a fine old time. It's the 43rd Annual Convention of the Grand Mystic Royal Order or the Noble's Heart the Ali Baba Temple of the Shrine. Meanwhile back at the motel. Hello, operator. Room 320. How'd you know? Oh. Hello, McCoy? Where have you been? [laughter] No, you wasn't at the meeting. Well, I found out that at 3 o'clock this morning, you was out there in the hotel swimming pool, and you threw the looms with a bunch of them waitresses from the cocktail lounge. How is old Charlene going to find out about this, McCoy? Who's that talking in the background, McCoy? Hello, operator? Operator? Please cut out. Room 321. [applause] He sings pretty good. Oh boy, am I hungry. Sings pretty good? That was Ray Stevens, the Ray Stevens. Ray who? Oh, will you do me a favor? While you're in the C's, read up on some country music, would you? You're embarrassing me. Well, you better pay less attention to what you call it up there and more attention the trouble we're in. Somebody tried to kill us. Maybe. Maybe somebody just mistook us for somebody else. Did you ever thing about that? Yeah. Or maybe somebody don't want us to find out about Carla. Well, now that's dumb. Carla's dead. Yeah, but how did she die? Do you think she was murdered? That's something we won't know till we find out. Right. Oh. Oh, Mr. Stevens, can I have your autograph please? Why, sure. Glad to. Here. Who shall I make this out to? Well, I'm JD, and this is my friend Will here. JD, Will. How you doing? How are you? All right. Ray, super show. Hey. Thanks, hon. Great. I appreciate you coming. Oh, I planned to be here. Barbara Mandrell, JD and Will. Hello. Hello. Oh, we're in a heap of trouble here. Why? Well, Ms. Mandrell, I'm going to have to go home, and I'm going to have to tell some friends of mine that I spoke to you in person. And when I do, one of them is going to call me a liar. And when he does, I'm going to hit him in the mouth. And it's going to be the awful-est fight. Then that's going to get Will here in a fight. He's just angling for an autograph, ma'am, to prove he knows you. Let me give him one. I certainly wouldn't want to be responsible for any brawls. Listen, I've got to go change. Barbara, I'll see you at your table later. - OK, Ray. - Nice meeting you guys. Ray, great show. Nice meeting you Ray. You fellas here on a visit? Well, no. Actually, we are private detectives. Actually we're helping this girl we know find her sister. Any chance you seen her? Will, this is Barbara Mandrell. She does not work talent show, OK? My buddy here is pretty good at detecting but he ain't from nothing about country music. Now me, I got every record you ever made. Hey, I've seen this girl right in here. There was an amateur contest and she won it, and the prize was appearing one night with me. Carol, I think was her name. Carla. Carla Wade. Yeah. The man that can tell you about her runs this Wax Museum down here. Barnaby is his name. Oh, no. No, we've already talked to him. He hadn't seen her since she left-- what? Three months ago. Well, the night she sang with me he was there. She was good, too. Not polished but a lot of promise and a really nice girl. He was giving her a hassle back in the dressing room, and the management had the cops throw him out. You know what the argument was about, ma'am? Well, as near as I could make out, he was really hopping mad because she was coming on to this awful dude, Joe Hatcheck. Looks like we ought to talk to this Hatcheck guy. Well, if you do, you watch yourselves. He smiles a lot, but he's a killer. He's mean. He's into a lot of things and most of them are crooked. Like what, ma'am? Well, for one thing, I've heard that he runs a floating crap game where nobody comes out a winner. Oh, well now, where would somebody find that floating crap game? Well, I don't know anything about dice, but my steel guitar player does. In fact, he's into about three months salary worth of dice, and he lost it on the Cumberland Queen. [MUSIC - A TASTE OF HONEY, "BOOGIE OOGIE OOGIE"] [singing] If you're thinking you're too cool to boogie. Oh boy, have I got news for you. Everybody here tonight to boogie. Let me tell you. The groove is going to get you, too. Hey, this is going to be great. Not for me, it ain't. What's wrong? I get seasick. On a boat tied to the dock? I get seasick in a bathtub. Let's find Hatcheck and get this over with. [music playing] [interposing voices] [interposing voices] Well, now I know what they mean by a floating crap games. Where are you going? Well, I'm going to take this money we've got left here, and I'm going to go down there and get in that game, and turn this into a small river bottom farm, because dice is my long suit. Last time I heard, poker was your long suit, son. I feel lucky tonight. The lucky guy in that game is the one that don't get his legs broke. Mr. Hatcheck? This dude faded $500. He hasn't got it. He wants to leave his marker with us. I don't take markers. Take his watch and his rings, and throw him out. [interposing voices] Oh, you fellas are just in town a couple of days and you've already located the action, huh? To tell you the truth, action ain't what we're looking for-- it's answers. And so far, they've been pretty hard to get. I run a game, fella-- not an information desk. Well, you knew Carla Wade, and we want to find out what happened to her. Do you see how healthy I am? Mm-hmm. Well, it's not from jogging. It's from minding my own business. This is our business. Come on, pal. I know every cop in this town. You ain't no cop. Well, let's just say there's some dudes up in New York City got a big interest in what happened to Carla, OK? And they're dudes with a lot of muscle. You dig? Look, I don't know what happened to her. But I'll tell you something, whatever it is I hope it's bad. She is no good, blood sucking-- look, all I know is she got what she wanted out of me and my contacts. A few introductions, some club dates, a couple commercials. And I talked to this friend of mine who owed me a few favors to let her hostess the disk jockey convention. And she meets Mr. Superstar. Who's the superstar? Do you got a problem here, Mr. Hatcheck? HATCHECK: No, that's all right. These-- these fellas were sent in by some heavy characters from New York. Well, they totally looked out topside. They were tourists from Montana. You want to explain that? Yeah. Number one, what's wrong with Montana? Number two, me and my buddy Will here visiting Opryland. And my godfather in New York sent us some orders, you dig? Why don't you find out what these folks really want and drop them off at the hospital? JD? Did you got them? I'm here to help you out, son. I'm glad my insurance is paid up. Hold it. This is a bust. Uh-oh. That's the guy that don't like cowboys. Come on. Hey, I wonder how the police knew we was in trouble. Maybe they heard it from your godfather in New York. [music playing] Hey, Hatcheck. He's stealing our car. [explosion] [music playing] Morning. You're just the man we want to see. We've got a serious complaint we want to put on record. I spent the last four hours trying to find something to bid on you two and make it stick. But since you weren't in the game, the DA won't charge you. Well, that's only fair. I'm warning you. Either you two get out of Nashville, or I'm going to find a way to have your hides. Now, that's our serious complaint. You've been spending a lot of energy trying to pin something on us. Yeah. And we think your time would be better spent on protecting innocent citizens in Nashville. We've been shot at, beat up, somebody tries to blow us up on the same day. Heck, there's more violence here than in the whole state of Texas with New York City and Detroit thrown in. Let them out. Out! Get out! - Thanks for the hospitality. - Yeah. And just be glad we ain't taxpaying citizens. First off, I'm going to take me one of them sexy bubble baths. You do that while I throw us up some eggs, OK? If I didn't know any better, I'd think Lt. Blocker had been here. Well, what they looking for? Beats the hell out of me. Hey, the package. The one we picked up for Lonnie Grimes. Maybe. - Well, did they get it? - Nope. I hid it good. Shoot. Will, you reckon we ought to call the cops? JD, that fight last night must of scrambled your brain. [phone ringing] Phone. Where's the phone? [phone ringing] Hello? Oh, Lonnie. Yeah, how you doing? I'm calling you from Memphis. I just wanted to check on you boys and make sure you're enjoying yourselves. Oh, we're enjoying ourselves. Oh, by the way, did you remember to pick up that package for me? Right. Picked up the package. Put away safe. Good thing, too, Lonnie. Because we come in here a minute ago, and somebody has just ransacked your place. Now, don't worry about it though. We'll clean it up. We'll take care of everything. Yeah. Well, we'll see you. All right. Well, he sends his best, Will. What did he say about his place getting tore up? Not much. You know, maybe in his line of work, his digs get tore up all the time. I don't know. I wonder what's in that package of his. I don't know. You want to look? We're guests in his house. It hardly seems the thing to do. You know, I could of asked him. What you should of asked him is what a real detective does when he's been worked over the way we've been. Well, Kojak will probably just keep on sucking on his sucker. Perry Mason would probably talk to Della for a day and a half. I said, real detective, JD. Now, a real detective would have given up the case and shagged on out of here before he got his head broke. You know what's bugging me, Will? Now, we ask a few questions about Carla, and me and you are darn near killed. But now Kate's been asking questions all over this town before she ever got to us. You're right. That lady could be in more trouble than we are. We'd better go warn her. Come on. [music playing] I mean, if we're going to do it, let's do it right. You ain't seen a couple of hot shot detectives go riding around on the bus. Yeah. Well, if I see any hot shot detectives, I'll tell them that. [music playing] Excuse me. We called a little while ago about Ms. Kate Harper. Do you know if she got our message? No, sir. She didn't. I'll try her room for you. Thank you. Sorry, gentleman. No answer. Well, sir. I guess since we're here, we ought to mess around a while until she comes in. Ma'am. Thank you. Son, I could spend a week right here. Opryland. Opryland. Yeah. The Opry is right across the road. Have you ever been to Opry? No. Boy, you'll love it. I'll bet there's 50 stars within a half mile of us right this minute. And all of them just panting, waiting for you to ask them to sign an autograph. Will, suppose-- now just suppose they got her. Who? Kate. She's just out. You know, maybe shopping or something. Yeah or maybe she's laying up there in a pool of blood. Where are you going? Up to Kate's room. Do you mind? Come on. (WHISPERING) Here's the room. OK. (WHISPERING) There. You satisfied? No pool of blood. (WHISPERING) Well, they could of took the body away. (WHISPERING) You've always been a little daft, JD. But now, you're just plumb out of your gourd. (WHISPERING) Well, why don't we just go in there and look? Ow. Where did you learn that? (WHISPERING) Watergate. Watergate That starts with a W. I thought you were still in the C's. We're already breaking and entering. I'm not going have no part in digging into somebody's private belongings. Well, we ain't going to find out any clues as to what happened to her by just staring at the lid. Nothing's happened to her except maybe in your messed up head. Well, a detective has just got to take chances where he works. Get out of the way. [music playing] THEME SONG: I'm breaking loose, running free. The open road is calling me. Well, my soul is restless, and my feet just can't be still. I don't know where I'm bound, but I know I'm bound to ramble around and taste of this of old life until I've had my fill. Now, there ain't no telling where tomorrow's due to find me. Maybe riding some old boxcar or sleeping in the rain. I might strike it rich in California, then loose it all on the east coast in a loaded poker game. Mama, it don't matter where I go or what I'm doing. Because I plan to go and do it all before I'm through. Well, I'm going to drink all the beer, love all the girls, see a great big piece of this world. Look out, this cowboy's breaking loose. Well, I'm going to drink all the beer, love all the girls, see a great big piece of this world. Look out, this cowboy's breaking loose. JD? Did it ever enter that knot head of yours that we don't know what the devil we're doing? We are solving our case, that's what we're doing. Look here. I found this in Kate's suitcase. Now, she should have given us this up front. Because this is a song and it was specially written by Woody Stone. And look what it says right there. "To my sweet Carla from the one who loves you more than life." And that's Woody's name right down there. Woody who? Woody is probably the biggest, the most famous, the most important country star there ever was-- that's who Woody is. And he was in love with Carla. Well, I guess if we're going to get this over, we might as well just go on up there and see him. You don't just go up and see him. He's got agents, he's got managers, bodyguards. You could see the president easier. Look, we're just going to go out to his place. Ring the bell. Will, would you just get on reading your encyclopedia? Because the truth of the matter is you are about 10 volumes away from being more than plain dumb. And until you get to the D's, you probably ain't going to know what dumb is. Dumb? I'll tell you what dumb is. Dumb is ending up in Nashville instead of Hollywood. Dumb is pretending we're detectives. Dumb is driving somebody else's car into a police station. Dumb is spending the night in a tank. And dumb is looking for a pool of blood where there ain't one. That's what dumb is. Well, I never said I was perfect. But hey, Will, I got an idea. Go on. No! Well, it could get us to see Woody Stone. No! Will, don't say no until you hear what I got to say. I don't want to hear your argument. I ain't going to have no part of this. Will you trust me? I am just going to stay here outside and wait for the police to come. And when they do, I'm going to laugh fit to die when they haul you off to Lt. Blocker. Just trust me-- And when he hangs you by your tongue from the city hall flagpole, I'm going to wait down below just to claim your ornery body. [car honking] SALESMAN: Good day, sir. Oh howdy, neighbor. Is there something I can do to assist you? Well, no. I reckon it is more of what I can do to assist you, my good man. You see, I work for a gentleman called Will Eubanks the Fourth. Now, he's got four boys. And when he buys something for one of them, well, he has to buy it for all of them. You know, give them all an oil well a piece when he was born, you know. And so now Will wants to buy all his boys one of these here Excelsiors. One each? That's what he said. Four Excaliburs-- no. Actually, he wants give. He wants one for himself. But there's some things we got to wig out here first. Now, does this-- does this work? Everything works. Well, but Will ain't never had him no custom made car before. So JD said to me-- he says, you make sure everything works before you ever sign the check. I understand that. Remember, this is an Excalibur. Right. And that's what he wants-- an Excalibur. And I figure I can judge this pretty good driving it the next couple days. Your references, sir? The banks are closed for the weekend. Oh, the banks. Yeah, the banks. Old Wilbur got four banks himself. I'll tell you what we'll do. Look, you hold off detailing another car until you get the paperwork OK. I'll try this one out. And when I come in Monday, we'll sign the papers. How's that? SALESMAN: You will be careful of her, sir? Just like she was my own. [car honking] I'll give you this, JD. You could start with a toothpick and end up with a lumber yard. [music playing] Hey, my good man. We're delivering this car to Mr. Stone. It's a present from his band out in Montana. OK. Up the drive and park it. Thank you, sir. Fellas, I agreed to see you because anybody with the imagination to bring that car up to my place and convince my people it's a gift for me-- well, they deserve a little attention. I told you he was a sport. Didn't I tell you? I'm sorry I can't help you. This girl you're looking for-- what's her name? Carla Wade. Yeah. I don't know her. And to my recollection, I never did. I've got some recording to do in the studio out back. You guys can find your way out, huh? - Sure. - Thanks. You betcha. Sing it. [singing] Every night I go down to the same little joint. Fill up my glass till I've reached a point past remembering. OK. Where'd you get the song? It don't matter. What matters is that you wrote it for Carla. Yeah, I did. Want a drink? - I'll pass. Thank you. Thank you. What do you fellas have to do with Carla? WILL: She's dead. We want to find out why. Carla's dead? You want to tell us about her? Sure. It doesn't make any difference now that Carla's gone. She was one of those girls who thought it was an honor to be a hostess when the celebrities came to town. That's what she was doing at the disk jockey's convention. Ended up at my table. Mr. Superstar. Yeah, I guess. For a while, that was good enough for her-- Woody Stone's girlfriend. I took her on the concert tours, took her to recording studios, took her to parties. There was something in that girl just wouldn't let her rest. I mean, being with a star wasn't quite like being a star. But, uh, she had talent. She had a pretty face and a sensational body, that's what she had. And a voice as good as a lot of big names. But she didn't understand the lyrics. She didn't know what they meant. She didn't-- she didn't love the audience. Well, she didn't love anybody, I suppose. Except this picture she had of herself as a rich, famous star that she was going to become. So, uh, you chucked her out. Oh, no. I didn't. I wish it had been that way. I was just sitting down for supper one night and she came through the door. I couldn't do it, honey. I'm sorry. You didn't even try, did you? I asked them to do an album with you. I even promised them that I'd write a couple of songs. You asked them? Why-- why didn't you threaten them? Look, you're they're biggest star. They'll do anything for you. You sell millions of records for them. Honey, they're my friends. They brought me along when I was first starting out. You don't want me to make it, do you? All you ever want me to be is just your little playmate. Now honey, you know better than that. You got to have patience. It takes time. Look, I know guy who's got a club in Atlanta. You could-- - I know. I know. And you have a friend who has a club in Charlotte. And you have a friend who has a club in Knoxville. And I have worked my buns off in those dingy holes three shows a night for $400 a week. But you know you don't have to do it for money. I'll give you anything you want. Don't you understand? All I want is an album. That's all I've ever asked you for. That's all I've ever asked you to do for me. And what do you do about it? Nothing. All right. No, there is not going to be any more tomorrow. Not with you. I am sick to death of watching these no-talent hicks make it while I'm just sitting around in your shadow. And you want to know something else? I am sick to death of sleeping in an old man's bed. I'm getting out tonight-- right now. And that's just what she did. I never saw her again. I heard that she-- well, never mind. No, no, no. Go on, please. Well, I heard stuff I didn't want to believe. Believe what, sir? That she met this guy, Mr. Smooth. You know, no good written all over him. Tattoos, all that. He got her to work at Peg's Place. He did that all the time. Did what? Recruited girls for Peg's Place. You mean Peg's Place is a-- It's what we call a good-time house. It's off Murphy's railroad. I can't believe it. Well, I didn't want to believe it, so I finally just stopped thinking about it. And that's really all I can tell you guys. I'm sorry. I appreciate you laying her on the line. Well, once she had the goods on me about that song, I didn't have much choice, did I? Well, good luck to you. - Thanks. - And goodbye. Yes, thank you, sir. Oh, and thank you. Peterson. Those two cowboys are the wrong guys. But they're the ones who-- I don't care. You near killed wrong guys. That means that whoever we're after is out there someplace. Follow those two. Maybe they'll Lead us to whatever it is we're looking for. [music playing] LYRICS: Let me be your baby. OK, partner. Want to tell me what's ailing you? JD? Well, we got to find out what happened to that girl. We found out a lot already. Ain't' much of it good, either. I mean, look at her eyes. Go on and look at her eyes. Now, she should be happy. She just won a contest. I mean, she smiling, but her eyes are sad like she's hurting inside or something, you know? Well, that could be. But after what those people told us-- Now, Kate knew her better than anybody. Kate says she's a decent, sweet girl. Barnaby said she she's a treasure. Roy Acuff meets her one time, he's crazy about her. What about Mrs. Barnaby, Hatcheck, and Woody Stone? OK. Mrs. Barnaby-- now, she's a dried up old prune that don't want a pretty girl around. Now, Hatcheck's a warthog if I've ever seen one. I mean, Barbara Mandrell said don't mess around with him. You can't trust him. I suppose you don't believe Woody Stone either. No, he's just like Hatcheck. He wanted something from her, she ain't gonna have it. Chances are everything Woody Stone told us is a lie. Especially the part about her going to work over at Peg's Place. Well, we'll soon find out. You are a mess, JD. We ain't getting no place, Will. So now we're just going to nose around and quit letting on like we're detectives. There's only one person that mistook us for detectives so far and that's you. Great home, Peg. A lot of class. Well, thank you. One thing I tell my girls, girls, what the customer expects is class. And class is what they're gonna get. I send my girls to department school. They teach them to behave like real ladies. They just love me for it. Oh, I can see they would. Where are they? Oh, well it's early yet. They're still downtown. Some of them are at the hospital and some at the Red Cross giving blood. They're big on volunteer work. But I think my Juliet is around some place. Look, what about Carla? Carla Wade? She doesn't work here anymore. She quit just before Thanksgiving. My busiest time, the ungrateful little-- but I'll see you're both taken care of. Juliet? Juliet is a dear, sweet girl. She looks on me like a mother. Juliet, honey? Would you mind coming down here a minute? What do you want? I wanted you to meet these two gentlemen. Boys, this is Juliet. I told you, Peg. I ain't starting work till 8. And I told you, honey. You start when I tell you or you're starting a cast. Put 'em on, take 'em off. Come right out in here, boys, and have a seat. Have a drink, and think about what's in store for you. Well, what'll it be? Water. Uh, about Carla? Oh, forget about her. If Carla's a five, Juliet's a 10. Here's your water. Thank you, Miss Peg. Did you know Carla's boyfriend? He owes Will and me a bunch of money, see. She's got too many boyfriends that you can count. Well, the one we're interested in is her regular boyfriend. The one who's got a tattoo. That creep? Uh-huh. Listen fellas, whatever he owes you forget it. And don't try leaning on him. He's a hard case. Did he do you dirty? Well, we heard that he's the one that brought Carla to you? Brought her to me? Nobody does that. You know, I can't understand why after she gets to the top she'd give all this up anyway. Well, most of them go leave to get married, so they can work for free and wash diapers to boot. But I never did understand why Carla left. Last time I talked her was right here in this room. Can I talk to you for a minute, honey? Oh, well, I'm-- Excuse us. Your boyfriend's upstairs chewing his nails. Peg, um, do me a favor, OK? Just-- just tell him I haven't made up my mind yet. Tell him I'll talk to him tomorrow. Listen honey, I don't want to have no trouble. Go up there and get rid of him now. And that was that. That was the last I saw of her. She just packed her things and skedaddled. Not even a thank you. When did all this happen? I can tell you exactly because it was my birthday. November the 20th. Make yourself at home, fellers. I heard you. I heard you. But I ain't going to do it. You got to do it. All right. Well, promise me I don't have to do anything but dance or something. Oh, you're a good talker. You'll work it out. Now, go to it, lover. Have I really got to? I've got to. Come in. Uh, excuse me, Ms. Peg. Oh, well what can I do for you, dear? Well, it's like this. Juliet is an awfully pretty girl, but I've got this-- well, let's just say, I go for more mature ladies, OK? Especially if they're as pretty as you. And I was wondering if you'll have a drink with me. Just Just a drink, dear? Well, I thought we'd start with a drink. Well, I don't usually drink with my customers. But I've got to admit, you wake up my sleepy hormones. You remind me of my fourth husband. Really? He was a pistol. A pistol? He knew exactly what he wanted and how to go about getting it. Just the way you do. Well now, why don't you be my guest? Where's you're friend? Oh, well. Will-- he ain't as fussy as I am, Peg, so he's upstairs availing himself of the amenities. [dial tone] MAN (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello? Well, I finished my drink. Now what did you have in mind? Another drink. Now, we don't buy champagne by the glass. We buy it by the bottle. Well, it's $5 a shot. Well, it's only money. And that's one thing we got plenty of, right? You just bring out another bottle of that. Now, JD and I, we got to jump in our Excalibur and leave, but we'll be back. Then you'll see how the real big spenders operate. You just keep the change. Come on, JD. I'll drive. Oh, Ms. Peg. If you should hear from Carla's boyfriend, you just tell him that we're interested in seeing him. We'd be much obliged, ma'am. You're loco, that's what's the matter with you. Throwing money around like you're some kind of drunk sailor. Stop running your mouth. Dial this number. Well, who is it? That's Carla's number one regular boyfriend. About what he stole-- Dial the number, JD. And shut up for a change and listen. Hello? Hello? Who is this? That was Lonnie Grimes. [music playing] What makes you so sure Grimes will show up anyway? As soon as Peg tells him how we've been splashing money around he'll have to. Why? Because he'll think it's his money. What money? Which-- you opened the package. - I took a peak. - All right. Well, how much was in it? I didn't count it. Oh, come on. Was there $10,000 in it? More. Well, $20,000? $50,000? More than $50,000? $200,000. Dollars? Thereabouts. Whoa, jeez. I didn't know there was that much money short of Fort Knox. No wonder everybody been trying to kill us. Where'd you hide it? Well, hi, there. Hello. It's nice to finally see you. Well, it's good to see you, Lonnie. - JD, is it? - Right. You remember Will? How's everything been going? Just great. Couldn't be better. We're just surprised to see you, that's all. Oh, I'm just passing through town. I've got to get back to my case in Memphis. I thought I'd drop by and get that package you picked up for me. What was in that package, Lonnie? Me and Will nearly got killed over that thing. OK. I'm going to be straight with you guys. You level with me, I'll level with you. About what? Well, you showed up here. You told me you were busted broke. Just a few minutes ago, the manager downstairs tells me you're driving an Excalibur. Well Lonnie, we was broke when we got to town. But see, we called a banker and he sent us some of our oil royalties. Well, I'll be. OK, Lonnie. Since you're all for leveling with one another, I think it's your turn. Yeah. Why did you set us up? Set you up? What do you mean? I must have missed something. The only thing you missed was getting shot at, near blowed up. Of course, I reckon that didn't bother you seeing as you had JD and me around. Yeah. A couple of yo-yos right into town just fall in your lap. You realize the leg work we could've saved ourselves, JD? We've been wandering around six days from Sunday trying to find Carla, and all we had to do was talk to her boyfriend here. I underestimated you two. Don't feel bad. It happens all the time. I did know Carla but nothing heavy. I met her on the rebound from a fling with a big, big star. Woody Stone. She had it in her head to make an album. A client of mine was willing to produce it if she'd come up with the bucks. And you told her how to do it. Nobody had to tell Carla anything. She saw the only way she was going to make that kind of dough was the way women have made it for thousands of years. I tried to talk her out of it. I'll bet. This is a small town in a lot of ways. Woody Stone found out where Carla was working at and went bananas. He was waiting for her when she came back to her apartment one night. I happened to call about the album. I knew she was in big trouble right there. I tore right over there. WOODY: Carla, you can come back with me now. I want you to come back with me. Carla? CARLA: Woody, please. Just get out of here. I don't want you involved when they find me. WOODY: I am involved. I love you. Now-- CARLA: Woody, no! [gun shot] LONNIE: All I could think of was that it would be my word against Woody Stone's. And guess how far that would of got me? He's close to being a national monument. I decided to clear out. There didn't seem to be anything else I could. So go on. What next? I guess whoever cleaned up the mess for Woody must have been there all the time I was. The next thing I knew, he had hired himself a professional killer to knock me off. That's why I left town. Believe me, fellas. I didn't realize you'd get caught up in all this. I guess your living here and driving my car, Woody's man must have figured you was the ones he's supposed to be after. You really got the sharp end of the stick, Lonnie. Oh, you sure did. I guess we owe you an apology. Oh thanks, fellas. What I need to do right now is get that package and get out of town. That killer is still on the loose, and by now he knows you're the wrong mark. I'll get the package. That Carla-- she was something special, wasn't she? Yeah, she was. She must have been like one of them chameleons or something changing colors all the time, you know? [phone ringing] Hello? Have you got it? Have you got the money? Yeah. OK, look. Let's just get this over with, OK? Put one of them on the line. Hey, it's for you. This is for you. Thank you. Hello? Kate Harper. This is Will. Will, I-- I think I know where Carla's body is. You do? Where? Well, I wanted you and JD to meet me there. Do you think you could do that? Sure can. We'll meet you there in 20 minutes. You take care now. Bye. She says she knows where Carla's body is. Let's go. You guys have had enough trouble. I'll come with you. I'll follow in my car. Oh, about your car-- Oh, I'm driving a renter. [music playing] Do you believe all that stuff Grimes been telling you? My momma didn't raise no idiots. Well then how come you give him all the money? - It's a graveyard. - Come on. People hanging out in graves here. She said it was around here someplace. Well now, what was this about your momma not raised no idiot? Maybe just one. It looks like we was expected. I'm sorry about this, fellas. I really am. But you know too much for me to be leaving you running around. [gun shots] You let them get away. I don't care anymore. I'm getting out of here. Well, wait. We don't have to. I already took care of Woody Stone's hired gun. Now, all we have to do is get rid of those two cowboys and we're in the clear. You get rid of them. I'm splitting. I'm getting as far away from Nashville as I can. And I'm going by myself. What do you mean? Just what I said. You give me that. I don't want to follow me, do you hear me? Lonnie, please. Don't-- get out. Lonnie? Lonnie, please! Howdy, Kate. Wow. Hey, don't-- get her-- what's good slapping. I'm not-- Let's go, Carla. [music playing] Carla, I've been listening to every word. And all this time, and I still can't understand how you give it up. I finally just had to face the truth. This town didn't want me. Look, Nashville is a town for insiders. I was always going to be on the outside looking in. All these nobodies with no talent. Goony-looking girls from the hills. They were the ones who were making it big. I never would. So after all that, after Barnaby, Hatcheck, Woody Stone, and Peg's place, you decided to cash it in? I just decided to take what I could, whatever I could, and go somewhere else and start over. Maybe open a modeling school or get a band together and tour with it. All of which takes a lot of money, right? Right. And Lonnie had a way to get it. It was his idea. As soon as he realized Woody Stone would do anything to get me back, Lonnie came up with a plan. Those things will kill you. Sometimes I don't care if it does. Go on, Carla. You were talking about Lonnie's plan. Well, it was simple really. I just moved some of my things out of here and into a little apartment. Then I called Woody and told him I was going to kill myself. Carla, you can come back with me. Now, I want you to come back. Woody, please. I don't want you here. I don't want you involved when the find me. I am involved. I am in love with you. Woody, wait-- [interposing voices] [gun shot] The gun was loaded with blanks. Well after that, Lonnie started blackmailing Woody until Woody got sick of paying and decided to hire himself a killer. That's when we came along. Well, Woody didn't know who the blackmailer was, so he had the post office staked out. That's where he picked up you two. That's when I started to have to pretend I was my own sister. Look, it wasn't my idea. You have to believe me. I was just scared and desperate. Makes sense to me. Well, Lonnie's got the money now. He's got everything. What he's got is a package full of cut up newspaper. Where's the money? I got it safe. And we're going to do our best to straighten this out, Carla. So why don't you go freshen up? JD and I got some planning to do. You know, I knew the first time I saw you two that you were good people. That's us, honey. A couple of good old, down home boys. Good old, down home fool. That's what you are, JD Reed. What do you mean, being taken advantage of? She was in trying to get us killed in the first place for Pete's sake. All right. Well, where's the money? I've been carrying it around since the place got ransacked-- probably by Lonnie Grimes, you know. You've been walking around with $200,000 in your boots? I figured it's the safest place for it. Well Will Eubanks, you need to be in an insane asylum. OK, now. Calm down. I haven't got tied up with you for-- Look, I said calm down. OK. Are you calm? Yeah, I'm calm. But I know a prayer to-- Just be still. Calm? Yes, I'm calm. See the calm? Look at the calm. Now, listen. Ever since we got here, folks been trying to set us up. We get an inch off being killed five times over. I'll tell you, JD, I'm getting tired of it. Well, that makes two of us. There's three people we got to take care of. Lonny Grimes, Woody Stone, and that gal in there. And they do need some taking care of. That is for sure and for certain. There's some dead bodies lying around, but somebody is going to have to do some paying for it. Now, what we got to do is set it up so the right people have to pay for it. Oh. You mean tie up the loose ends like Buddy Ebsen and Jack Lore? Right. Great. Well, how are you going to do it? I'll tell you how. [phone ringing] Yes? Hi there, Mr. Stone. Will Eubanks. Remember me? What do you want? I understand you're out some money. What are you talking about? I'm talking about $200,000. But if you don't want it back, forget it. Nice talking to you, sir. Wait a minute. You mean you can get me the cash back? Sure can. What do I have to do? Just go pick it up. [phone ringing] Carla? No, Lonnie. It's Will Eubanks. You better never turn your back, fella. Because if it takes me 10 years, I'm going to bury you both. Oh, no. Hold it down. Don't work yourself into a fit. We're willing to work a trade with you. Your money for our butts. Where's the money? All right, now you take this down. All right. Go ahead. You take care now. Well, that about does it I guess, except for the lady back there. You want to talk to her, or do you want me to? No, you handle it. I've got another call to make. [door knocking] Come in. Well, let's go, Carla. You're going to turn me in, aren't you? Carla-- JD, look. I have been used by every person since I hit this town. Please don't turn me in. I deserve better than that. I know you do. I know you do. And I promise you won't get any more than you deserve. You mean that, don't you? Cross my heart. Cross my heart, too. You're too much. Both of you. Ain't that a fact. [music playing] LONNIE: I'll take that. It's mine. You're the creep that's been blackmailing me. Well, you're the creep that hired the professional killer. You're damn right, I did. You try to get out of here with this money-- No threats. I got the gun, big star. And if you spill to the cops, I'll tell them about your hit man. What he did to Hatcheck-- that makes you an accomplice to murder. Put the gun on the floor, Lonnie. Carla? You're alive? Believe me, I'll use this. I already killed one man last night. Now one more is not going to make any difference. Why don't you people hold it right there? JD: That's fine. Hey, ain't we partners? - I'm afraid so. - All right. Well, don't partners make decisions together? I guess. Well, then why won't you listen to my idea? OK. Let's talk about your idea. Well, that's better. But before we do, I just want to tell you I ain't going to stay another sundown in Nashville. Well, that's fine. Let's go to New York. What about Hollywood? No, Hollywood's too far away. Will, let's go to New York. The rodeo is in New York. We can make money. If I wanted to get my neck broke, I'd of stayed on the ranch. Well, how about Chicago? How about Hollywood? How about Kansas City? I know this chick that runs an escort service. She'll put us both to work. I ain't no gigolo, and I've already been to Kansas City. All right. How about New Orleans? You ain't never been to New Orleans. We can see the Mardi Gras, eat them oysters. The Mardi Gras is in February. Let's go to Hollywood. OK, OK, OK. We'll go to Hollywood. But first, let's stop fighting. I can a job dealing. You can get a job driving a cab. Las Vegas ain't no place to go when you're broke. How about Detroit? I ain't never built a car. I'll tell you what, JD. Let's just hop a freight west. And wherever it takes us, that's where we'll go. OK. I like that. OK. Now first thing we've got to do is take this car back. Well now, wait a minute. I'm the one that went to get the car. The least you can do it take the car back. No. You're a hard man, Will Eubanks. I try. I'll tell you what, we'll make a compromise. You don't take it back and I don't either. Old JD's got a plan. I don't want to hear about it. JD: You're the best, Will. You guys managed to do all right in a mighty short time. Well, some of us are just born lucky, I guess. Man, this is a car. You know, when good folks go to heaven, this is what they're got to be riding in. - Is that freight pulling out? - Right away. Where's it headed? West. You want to look the other way for a spell? The next town might not be so friendly. You better keep it. Now, get going. Hey, I'll tell you what you do. Why don't you drive it until it runs out of gas. And then call the Excelsior people, and tell them we don't want it. OK? [music playing]
