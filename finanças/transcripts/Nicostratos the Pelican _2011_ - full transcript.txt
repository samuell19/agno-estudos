I want to tell you a story that changed my life. It happened on Zora... ...a small Greek island discovered in the 17th c. by French Corsairs. They decided to spend the winter there because life was tough. Even today, Zora is a small village... ...where life revolves around cafe Aristote. Everyone knows each other, news travel fast... ...and stories are passed down from generation to generation. The locals remember the love that bound my parents... Demosthene and Antonia... and their wedding day, when my father gave to his wife... ...the family cross. When mum died, I inherited her golden cross, something symbolic. And I, Yannis... ...shall tell you how this cross changed my life. Come on, courage! Don't relax! Pedal hard! Meditation's all good, but we need to burn some fat! What did he say? He wants us to pedal standing. I can hear you whining! Save your breath. The climb's just started. One, two. One, two. Come on, with feeling! One, two, one, two. Now I get what Christ had to go through, climbing to Calvary. Hi Thomas! Hi Yannis! Slower, Popa Kosmas! They're left behind! I know. They fattened up this year. Going to the capital too? Yes, I have shopping to do for my father. You? Tonight is the Orthodox Archipelago Seminary. It seems I need to attend. One, two, one, two... In Zeus's name! -Hi Yannis! -Hi Giorgos! Whom are you looking for? -I came to see the Captain. -The Captain? Follow me. I'll go find him. Wait here. You're cute. But you stink. -Making yourself at home? -He's thirsty. I want to give him something to drink. Do you have water? Get out of there. Where is the raki? There. Are you the smuggler? I was expecting someone bigger. I'm not a smuggler. The raki is local. You owe me 60 Euros. Where did you find this bird? I've never seen anything like this. You ask too much. Take your money and get out. Give it to me, I'll take care of it. You're a rascal! This is a collectible bird. -It's expensive. -How much is it? 60 Euros. If I return with no money my father will kill me. What about this cross? Why? Do we break even with it? Let me see it first. Is it gold? Of course it's gold! It was my mother's. She died three years ago. And you're swapping it for a half-dead bird? I like half-dead birds. Won't your father get mad when you tell him? He won't learn, don't worry. For him, it's as if I don't exist. Better here than your box. I have to hide you. My father doesn't want animals in the house. I was wondering if I had made the right choice. If exchanging mum's cross with a smelly bird... ...was indeed a good idea. Damn it! Dad's back already. Mum would forgive me for breaking family tradition... ...to save the life of this funny bird... My father, he was a different story. Hi Kitsa! Don't move from there. I'm going to help my father. Stay hidden. Kitsa! Don't stand there. Out of the way. What a lousy catch! What's she looking for? No clue. She was probably in the sun too long. Did you remember to put gasoline? I forgot. Sorry. It's not enough to apologise. Don't forget to fix the nets. Kitsa, leave him! Leave. Go away! This thing with horns is called "goat". She's not very smart, but we need her to make cheese. You'll get used to her. You must be hungry. You've been through a lot. Milk and bread, like it? You're a funny bird. You have a swan's beak... duck feet... a frog's neck... ...and a hen's tail. There you go. You're not right, it's nice. Yes! You've got to understand. It's a bird, not a goat! This will substitute my golden cross. No harm done. That's a good place for you to sleep. Don't worry, my father never comes into my room. Your beak is very strong. Stop! Are you hungry? Tomorrow, when my father goes fishing... ...I will feed you. Don't make a fuss. If my father finds you, he'll kill us. He can be very mean. Come here. I was right! You're a seabird. I'll give you a boat name. Nicostratos! Yeah, it's good. Nicostratos! He definitely wasn't an ordinary bird. He was funny, but also affectionate. Which species could it be? It could be a cross between an ostrich and a dog... ...or a swan with laryngitis. The only person who could answer all my questions... Popa Kosmas. A priest unlike any other... ...who knew all the bird types. Morning, Father Alexi. Morning, Yiannis. -I'm looking for Popa Kosmas. -Are you in a hurry? Yes. -I want to show him something. -OK, follow me. Octopuses release a cloud of ink through a black sac. We collect this priceless substance... ...and we stir it into our rice. It's very easy to make. Look at the beautiful colour. Gentlemen, let's get real. Octopus with rice is a complete dish, rich in protein. And with some holy communion, it's exquisite. Watch the pot. Yannis? You're early. Kids, sit down. So! What do you want to show me? A bird. -What kind of bird? -That's why I came. So you can tell me. Here. Look. A small Pelecanus onocrotalus! -A what? -Pelecanus onocrotalus! It's the scientific name of the white pelican. Who gave him to you? The captain of "Steni Papades". A brute who was torturing him. If he gave him to you, he can't be that much of a brute. He didn't give him to me. I had to trade something for him. What? -My golden cross. -The one your mother left you? It's bad, I know. You did a kind deed. In any case, jewellery is a dead thing. He will grow soon. White pelicans are big birds that easily reach 1.60 m. -Wingspan? -No, height. They are gigantic birds. For the time being, though, leave him here and sit with us. So you're a giant bird? Kitsa! Shit! It's 8! Keep on snoring. I'll deal with you when I'm back. -Eat, vegetables are good for you! -No they're not! They're not! -Morning Mrs Karoussos. -Morning Yannis. This is not a cucumber, it's a gherkin. Everything's small in your vegetable garden, Christina? Popa Kosmas, if you don't like it, go and buy them from Kiki. -Hello Aristote. -Hello Yannis. Small catch. You don't have squid? Stop bothering me. You have fresh fish. If you are as sweet with them as with me, of course the fish ran away. -Do you make them? -Yes, with my goat. She gives me manure for the vegetables and milk for the cheese. Hello Demosthene. What are these clothes? -Work clothes. -Take them off. You can't sell in work clothes. Demosthene, leave him alone. You're scaring him. What? He's not in his underpants. Before you scold your son, look at yourself in the mirror. Leave me alone. I'll raise Yannis as I like. Got it? And you, eh? What a lousy character! Since my mother died, father was not the same. Days would pass without him speaking. I was happy to have a new friend. I decided to put Nicos in the storage room... ...and dug a passage from my room for easy access... I watched him grow and get stronger and more beautiful every day. In Zora, life followed the rhythm of the seasons... Mushrooms in autumn. Chestnuts in winter. We were used to our island's plenitude. Morning, Father Alexi! And Nicos benefited from this... ...but it was harder and harder to hide him. Easy, easy. You're a little glutton. Let me caress you. I have stuff to do but we'll have fun too. I have to order a pump from Athens. -Will you write the letter for me? -Yes dad. The address is: Giorgos Karvounis. Piraeus. Boat engines. -OK? -Yes. Athens. Port area. My engine is a 48 hp Yanmar. "My engine is a Yanmar... Go away! ...48 hp." Are you writing? Yes. The injection pump broke down. Come on, go away! -Do you hear me? -Yes. Please let me know if you have a spare part in stock. And sign it, Demosthene Kuzmanovich. Kuzmanovich Nicos's arrival had not upset our household habits... In the beginning, our little goat, Kitsa, was the biggest issue. Cohabitation didn't come easy... The two housemates started a merciless war... Horns versus beak. Beak versus horns.... The winner was whomever had the best imagination. Each one defended their area with fortitude. Finally, after confronting each other, my two friends declared peace. The most difficult thing was announcing it to my father. Nice! Now you need to learn how to fly. It's not difficult, you'll see. Look at me, I'll show you. You open your wings and take off. You flap your wings and jump. Come on then. Jump now, jump. You're such a lazy bum. Catch it! Stop, you can't eat this! Jump, jump! Run, run, run! Damn it! My father's coming! Hide, quickly. -What is this bird? -It's a pelican. He's mine. -Where did you find him? -It's a long story. This is how you spend your day, eh? Playing with a bird? I do my work and I also take care of him. -Where did he go? -In the storage room. That's where he sleeps. Who gave him to you? Don't lie, Yannis. I bought him from the captain of "Steni Papades". You bought him? -I traded him for something. -For what? Mum's cross. You traded Antonia's cross with a pelican? This? What is it? What is this? What is this? Dad! Dad, dad. Dad! Dad, leave him. Come on, go away! Go away! Dad! Pelican! Go away! The medicine! If I see the pelican again, I will kill him. More. The cross! It broke! Nicos! You came back! Where have you been? Nicos! My Nicos! Don't make any noise, you'll wake up your greatest enemy. Don't worry, no one will keep us apart. I'll take you to Myrta. You'll see, it's magical. Wait for me! Wait for me. Soon you will fly Nicos! Since that day my father and I haven't talked to each other. Listen to me. It was bound to happen. But, ultimately, it's wonderful news. -Sorry? -Hold the sides, like this. There you go. Since he knows now, you can move on. Everything will go back the way it was. Popa Kosmas, my father wants to kill me... ...because I gave the cross and because I lied. He will never forgive me. You must be patient Yannis. You're not the one that lives with him. Everything will be fine. I got a message from above. Are you sure that's what it says? Nicos finally flew. I was envious of him seeing our island from above... He had become a big and beautiful bird. But I soon realised he wouldn't pass unnoticed for much longer. Super, Nicos! You can improve your landing though. Promise me you won't go far. I don't want to lose you, my Nicos. A pelican, daddy! -I saw him first! -No, I did. No, I did. Hi Demosthene. -Everything OK? -Yes. On Thursday... can you keep a crate of mackerel and two of squid for me? Forget about the squid. Your children are all hyper. Are you feeding them coffee? Blame the mysterious pelican. Everyone's talking about him in the village. We saw him flying near the lighthouse. Stop fighting! Children love pelicans. They're beautiful birds. Stop fighting! Can't you show a little respect? Is Yannis OK? I haven't seen him in a while. -Everything OK? -Really, how is he? Let's order. How did it go in the market today? Not that bad. I don't know what's wrong with people but they don't shop like they used to. And what... ...are your plans for tomorrow? -Tomorrow? -Yes, tomorrow. I have to go to the monastery to clean the icons. Popa Kosmas is relying on me. Should I play music? The ferry was full of tourists who wanted to see the pelican. It's a disaster for our island. Eh, Aristote? Or an opportunity! A flood is coming my friends! We have to build an arc. It started? They're presenting the teams. Sit down. Would you like a drink? Raki! I'm telling you, this pelican is great for business! Vasilis, tonight we're talking about the match, not the pelican! If you don't like that, go outside. Shush, it's starting. Uncle? Angeliki! My niece! Good evening! She's cute, right? She's my brother's daughter. She came to work for the holidays to make some pocket money. Look at her, talking with the Germans. She has a bright future. Do you want your glasses? Pardon? You're too obvious! -Sorry, what do you think I am? -A very unorthodox Orthodox. You're overreacting! Be careful in the sun. We're in Zora. There's no signal. -How much is the cheese? -2.40 Euros. Look! What is this? It's big! No, Nicos! Go away! You can't stay here. Go away! Let me work. -He likes cheese? -Is he an albatross? No, a pelican. He came and went. He's huge. He's on my roof. -Does he belong to you? -He belongs to no one, we're friends. Go way, I tell you! He's funny! He's coming! You don't listen. Come here. Let him pass! Come on, come on. And now fly! Go back to your grotto! Incredible! Great success! What a beautiful bird! Your son could take advantage and make loads of money. This pelican is a gift from above! Go away! Get outta here! Yannis! Come and drink something with us. Tell us about your pelican! No, thank you. My customers are waiting. I can't leave my stall like that. If it's work... Aristote doesn't buy drinks frequently. You have to grasp the opportunity. My name is Angeliki, I'm the boss's niece. -And you are? -Yannis. Angeliki! -I can't be everywhere! -Cool down, uncle! Don't call me uncle in front of the customers, it's unprofessional! Cool down, uncle! I have to go. I saw you before with the tricycle. I'd like to go for a ride some time. Yannis, when is he coming back? Go away! Go away! A piston broke. Tomorrow you'll walk to the village. -What's his name? -Nicostratos. -Is he big? -Yeah, he's big. -How big? -1.60 m. Does he eat burgers? No, he doesn't eat meat. He's a seabird! Hi! What's up? Getting used to your fame? Come help me a bit! My uncle is constantly talking about you. Yesterday he made the most profit in his whole life! You should have seen him counting the money! Tears in his eyes! Left your pelican at home? He doesn't live with me. Dad didn't want him. -He lives elsewhere on the island. -Where? -I'd rather not tell you. -You're right. I just asked, because they keep asking me. I hate bees! Angeliki, could you come to work on time? I pay you generously! "Generously?" Did I get a raise? Yannis, wait! I will buy some cheese. Uncle doesn't miss a chance. I bet he will talk to you about the pelican. If he doesn't, I'll eat my hat. Feel like a juice? On the house! Put it there! You can call your pelican too. Angeliki, go make a juice for the village star. -With a straw too. -A straw? Are we celebrating, uncle? Your pelican really impressed the customers. -Talked about him all night. -Yes, Angeliki told me. She also told me you cashed in a lot too. I can't confirm this. It's a professional secret. No problem. Business is business. Speaking of business, wanna come by around 5 tomorrow with Nicostratos? No one's around at noon, but if you come in the afternoon... ...you'll find people who would pay for a photo. You can pose in front of the shop for a nice background. You can make some money on the side and I don't want anything! The juice! With a straw. Without a straw. -Why are you laughing with the straw? -I'm smiling, uncle. There's a difference. I don't get the joke. Think about it, OK? Look! It's the boy with the bird! You're that boy with the penguin, aren't you? Pardon? The penguin. I mean the pelican. I wanna take a picture of yous together. She says she wants to take a photo of the pelican. -What's the compensation? -Cash. She will pay for a photo. You have to accept. Tell her that I am not interested, but I thank her. Do you have a fortune or just brain damage? You're just like your uncle! Money is not everything in life. So? My friend asks how much. I'll pay... ...10 Euros for a great picture. What is she saying? She says she thinks your pelican is lovely. Tell her I know he is lovely. He says it's not enough. -Wow! A businessman! -I know! I'll pay 15 Euros, but it's my final offer. Her niece is very sick. She couldn't come with her and she loves pelicans. She would be so happy to see a photo of her aunt with a pelican. OK. Only one though. It's OK. But for 20. It's like I'm doing business with Bill Gates here. -It's a deal. -Look! Nicostratos! Here we are! The pelican has arrived! You make more this way than with your cheese, right? Hello Kitsa. I'm going to Fira tomorrow, for the vine harvest. Will you be gone long? As long as it takes. We need the money. Time will pass, you'll see. Kitsa, you're trouble. Dad goes further every time to find fish. You don't care, you don't pay for fuel. I decided we will help him. Zora became the Pelican Island. More and more tourists came... which made Aristote happy... ...as he owned the only cafe on the island. He quickly learnt how to profit from the island's attraction. Nicostratos had made it. He proved good for business. But the profits were kept a secret. The girl is busy. Nice! You have to hire more hands. Are you nuts? To fill the coffers of the State? No. Angeliki is family. Black money stays in the family. If you want to work you're free to do so. She just started. She doesn't know yet the secrets of the trade. Your share. -Who do you think I am? -A great manager. How come you don't want it? Do you have a fortune or just brain damage? Uncle, can I have the day off tomorrow? I want to go to the shops with Yannis. Day off? Mid-season? Do you want to destroy me? You'll manage just fine, uncle! You're quick, you see everything... you know how to chat with the customers, they love you... ...and you won't have to pay me. Bye bye Aristote! Look, this is the boat where I bought Nicostratos. -The coast guard stopped it. -Why? They were washing the tank near the coast. Not surprised. How much did he sell him for? I traded him for the gold cross my mum had given me. -I imagine she was pleased. -She died 3 years ago. You don't have a mum? Who do you throw tantrums at? Let's go. Sorry. I say stupid stuff that I regret sometimes. No worries. You're my only friend. How did your father react when he learnt you gave your cross away? Badly, but I'm used to him. He's got a lousy personality. Athens, here we come! Let's go find my cousin. You'll see, he's cool. What are you doing here? And with company? This is Yannis. Shall we dance? -Are you coming? -I'm not much of a dancer. Me neither. You forgot to take the tag off. Yannis, look! Here you go, grumpy! -My cross! Where did you find it? -In the street. I saw something shiny next to my feet. I looked, and it was your cross. No, I went to "Steni Papades" while you were sleeping. Dummy. You went to the port in the middle of the night? Are you nuts? I went with my cousin. He's my bodyguard. He would die for me. I will never forget what you did. It must have cost you a lot. No way. I haggled, you know how I am. Now you can't deny me anything. Take me to Myrta. You don't give up, right? Where is Nicostratos? He's hiding. I'm dying of hunger. When are we eating? Just a sec. We first need to fish our food. To fish? It's quite high. Come on, jump! I'm not sure. Not sure I want to. OK, I'll try. Don't be jealous. What are you doing? You scared me! When it's grilled it will be tasty, you'll see. Well, anyone who dives the longest without coming up for air... ...will eat the largest! I won! Sure! I see you served yourself! Nicos! He won after all. He used to take me with him fishing, we did stuff together. -He changed after mum died. -Does he scold you? -All the time. -Does he beat you? No, never! But he scolds me all the time. It's really annoying. He scolds you? And that's the only thing you have to say? Why, what's the problem? You have to learn to vent out a bit. Would be good for you. Let's go! He annoys us! He pisses us off! You annoy us! You piss us off! You seem sad. What? You seem sad, I said. Why would I be sad? I had the best day of my life. What? I'm saying it's really cool to have you as a friend. Not always easy, but nice. What? I'm not giving you any! Leave him, Nicos! Are you OK? Why are you crying? He attacked me! -What happened? -He's not bad, you know. He should be in a zoo. He wants to play. Go back to your grotto. -The kid's dad was outraged. -He just ate his ice cream. -Let's not make a fuss. -Imagine if he took his eye out! Everything seems a joke to you. Pelicans are wild animals. I turned him into a circus bird. And here's the result. He loves spicy olives and pickled herrings. Everyone feeds him, he doesn't bother fishing. You're overthinking things. Nicostratos loves company. He's happier here than in his grotto. I'm not that sure. Let's buy him sunglasses so he can come to the docks incognito. You're pissing me off. You don't care about others. You're like your uncle. And you're like your father. Manoli, where are you hiding? Come out of hiding! Not funny anymore, come out! Do you like it? When is your father coming back? He didn't say. When he picks all the grapes. Careful, father! Leave me! -Are you doing better? -Not better, not worse. But I miss him. It's normal. He's been gone for over two weeks. I miss him even when he's here. Cool, huh? All this thanks to your son. I mean... his friend. Come in! A lot has happened since you left. Seems so. The pelican proved a blessing for the island. The village was never this busy. Even the boat that goes to Mykonos, stops here now. We're doing great! You only think of money. The harvest didn't change your attitude. -You like all these idiots? -We make a living from these idiots. You owe them some respect. If you came to ruin things, you should have stayed at home! I am in my home! This is my village. I got married here. It would be good for you to find a wife. Tourists are not going to tell me what to do. -Are you OK uncle? Who was it? -Yannis's father. I didn't have time to duck. He surprised me. Dad. Dad! Dad! When did you come back? A while ago. The house was empty. Where were you? What's that T-shirt and those new shoes in your room? -Who paid for them? -I did. -With what money? -With the money I earnt. Earnt? I pose for tourists. They photograph me with Nicostratos. -Is that a job? -More profitable than fishing! This way I bought back mum's cross. Yannis. Let me sleep. Don't be afraid Nicos. We're protected here. Nicos, don't be afraid. Nicos! Nicos! Angeliki? Waiting for the tide to clear the tables? Very funny, uncle. Leave it, I don't feel like it. Go away. Come back later. I don't feel like it in the morning. No, Nicos! Get out of here! Come on, go! Nicos! Now we're arriving at the pelican's village. We could see Nicostratos. Mrs Flora, there was no round one so I got you long ones, OK? They never make enough. Nicostratos! Come! Come on, don't be mad at me! Come on, come! You will park next to cafe Aristote. Not my fault. Aristote! Aristote! Why are you wearing glasses if you run over things? -He was talking to me. -No need to look at me! You were talking to him! Don't distract the driver! Even idiots know this! Get out of the way. Quiet! -What happened? -The bus hit him! -Look at the beak! Empty the table. Scissors! Scissors, quickly! It's done. Save him, dad! He will die. Help me, dad. It's better if we end his suffering. Help me. Don't let him die, dad. I promise you he won't feel any pain. Dad! Mum! The whole village was shocked, everyone talking about my health... Angeliki came to see me, and reassured people. But sadness spread on the island... ...and Myrta, memories of our beautiful moments faded away. Aristote! Demosthene. Oh shit. -He's in a bad mood. -When is he in a good one? We would like to say that we're really sad about Yannis. Yes, what happened is very bad. Thank you. Where's your niece? I'm here. Could you keep Yannis company today? -Uncle? -Of course. -Sorry for the punch. -I was asking for it. He surprised me. I didn't have time to duck. We know, uncle. Angeliki took care of me when father went fishing. I didn't feel like anything. I refused to eat. Apart from Mrs Flora's Turkish delights. Special mix! We prepared this tea with your father. It's strong. Don't worry, he's better. Look at the city girl! -I feel guilty for what happened. -Don't be stupid. It was not you driving the bus. I pushed you to make Nicostratos a star. If you had not listened, none of this would have happened. He had a short, but good life. If I had left him on the ship he would have died before he could fly. What is done is done. I haven't told you everything. The day of the accident I called Nicostratos. He crossed the road to come and... After the loss of Nicostratos, the islanders were not the same. Aristote was sad. He missed Nicostratos and not because of loss in earnings. He might not seem so, but he's sensitive. Vasilis was inconsolable for having spoken to the driver... ...and having caused Nicostratos's death. They saw him roam around purposelessly in the village... And I changed... I had...as they say... ...matured. Yes, I had matured. At the end, life went back to its old rhythm. Mrs Karoussos and the priest decided... ...to add another member to their family. My father went fishing, or to cafe Aristote. Sailors know... ...that losing someone at sea, leaves a bitter taste. Athens tourist agencies erased Zora from their maps. The ferry stopped coming. Things went back to normal. Everything in order. Kids, everyone inside. At the end, things were not that bad. Are you disobeying your father? He must have said don't come till you recover fully. If I'm disobeying him means I'm fully recovered. True. What do you want to drink? A frappé coffee. And one frappé! Yannis, I'm happy to see you! -Are you thinner? Are you eating? -We feed him, uncle, don't worry. Your father doesn't come down to the village. My father? He comes every night to drink! Definitely not here. Does he go somewhere else? But where? This is the only cafe. Weird. Maybe he has a girlfriend. A girlfriend? You don't know him. If he doesn't have a girlfriend, where else could he be going? That's exactly what I want to know. -And your coffee? -You drink it, see you later. -You never told me what happened at sea. -What do you mean? When you took Nicostratos. Did he suffer? No, he died very quickly. -Why did you take him in the boat? -To protect you. And then? What did you do with him? I threw him in the sea. Don't be sad, he liked to fish... ...and to swim! I knew that Nicostratos's memory would never fade. Dad was trying to reassure me but he's not good at it. His explanations didn't satisfy me... ...and he didn't want to answer my questions. So, to understand, I had to insist. If dad didn't go to the cafe, where did he go? I wanted to know. -Is that you? -What are you doing? Trying to find out what my father is doing. You came at the right moment to keep watch. -If I want to. -Please. That's better. Where are you going? To search the boat. If he approaches, whistle. You know how? Easily! Damn it! Yannis! -Morning! -Morning! -Where is Yannis? -In the monastery. I was waiting for you. I have to ask you about fishing. You're interested in fishing? Do you mind going to the kitchen? The sun is blinding me. I'm a city girl. I'm going to write a paper about the people I met on holiday. Do you fish alone? Must be tiring... Especially pulling in the nets. I have a winch. Without the winch I wouldn't be able to pull them in. The metal wheel at the front of the boat? Yes. Do you also steer the boat at the same time? You need to be experienced. Doesn't the boat keel over when you take the full nets out? I almost keel over with my backpack, if it's a bit heavy. Does Yannis help? I mean when he's not in the monastery like today. Let's admit that he goes all the time. He spends a lot of time there. He could hold the wheel while you're busy with the winch. Can't be harder than your tricycle. I see this issue everywhere. People want everything for free. They don't get it, I think it's crazy. You fish for example. If you sold it for the price after deducting fuel... ...nets and boat upkeep no one would buy them. Do you know the price of a frappé? Do you know how much it costs to make it? It's crazy! That proves it. People don't get it. As for the tricycle, I heard you fixed it yourself. Are you a mechanic too? You are self-taught, right? In our times... ...manual labour is not appreciated enough. -Are you here? -No. -How was the rehearsal? -Very good. -I'll leave you to chat. -Thanks for the information. -So, what happened? -He cured him. I found medical instruments in the boat. He lied to me. I don't believe it. He might still be alive. Nicostratos is alive. Don't get excited. We don't know if he's alive. Maybe your father tried to cure him but didn't succeed. And where do you think he goes every night? -I believe that... -Wait! He's going to see him, I'm sure. Yannis! He's going to Myrta! He's going to the grotto! Wait for me! Yannis! Slower, I can't keep up! Dad? Dad! Nicos. Nicos! Nicos! Why didn't you say anything? Why did you let me believe he had died? So you wouldn't be hurt again. I wasn't sure I'd be able to save him. When I took him, I thought we would lose him, but he's strong. How did you manage to cure him? I asked Dr Lysandros to give me the necessary tools. I wanted to surprise you but I guess I didn't manage. No. You managed. You definitely managed. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Good evening Christina! Stop whining! Ignore him. You're not going to be whining till the end of your life. -Look, that's where we killed him. -You won't think of this forever. St Dimitris's feast. This was the big event in Zora. Everybody dressed up. There was music and dancing. The monk orchestra was playing the music. That year we decided to surprise the village. Nicos was nervous... And so was I. No one knew what would happen. Not even Popa Kosmas. Guys, this year we'll play something modern. We hope you have an unforgettable evening. Have fun everyone! The man I have become will never forget those moments... Popa Kosmas likes to talk about our philosophers... Saint John Climacus said: "Some trials divide us, and some unite us." This time, thanks to Nicos... ...the trial didn't divide us, it brought us closer... It was nice seeing things as they were before. That night of St Dimitris, dad helped me to... how shall I say... to learn to fly. Yes, to learn to fly. What's that? Rain dance? Wait. Translated by: mvk0016
