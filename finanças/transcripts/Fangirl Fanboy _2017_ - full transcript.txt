Here's your number, then go to the end of the line. There. Talk to them one by one, and do that crooked smile thing you do. Let's see if they'll let you be the first in line. Boss, your payment please. Huh? It says cash payment here. He doesn't really own a car. Do you really think we'd let you be the first in line? Go home! Standard protocol program system android data phase, activate. Good morning, Mr. Goon. I am your new system administrator and personal assistant. Sandy for short. Sandy. Very impressive. I didn't expect you to look so real. What do you mean I look so real? I am real, Mr. Goon. I am a real woman. I am essentially here to make your life better, Mr. Goon. Whatever you need, I'll provide it for you. Cut! We're on to the close episode. See you next week! Thank you, Director! Bye! Aimee! Hey! Come with me, and let's look at some cute boys from the next building! Come on! There's a lot of hot guys waiting for us. I can't today, I have a lot of school works. Also, I need to go to my classmate's house for a group project. You're such a buzz kill! Oh, boys! Listen carefully! The next numbers I'm going to call - is our final batch for today. - Belle! Belle! I'll just walk her outside. I'll be back to help you. - Alright. - Bye bye! - Take care! - Yes. - Make it quick, okay? - Yes! I'll be back. - What is it this time? - Alright, 439, go inside. 440! 441, hurry up! 42! 43! Come on, boys. Move it! 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51. Okay! Go wait inside. Hey, hey! Line stops here. This is the cut off. Cut off? Yes, the cut off. What do you mean "cut off"? Huh? It's already the cut off! Wait, I'm the next number in the last batch. Can you at least let me in? Because I'm sure that none of them will ever get the part. What's your number? 452. Name? Ollie Francisco. Ollie Francisco, yes. You're our number one tomorrow. I placed your name here. What? Get in line first thing in the morning. Before 6:00AM, you should be here already. Wait a second. I've been here all day. You've seen how sweaty I am. It's intense. Can you just please? Mr. Ollie Francisco, if I grant your request just because "you've been here all day", then everyone else would be entitled to request for the same thing, right? I'm sorry, but a cut off is a cut off. See you tomorrow. Miss, you know what? I don't need this! All of this! Your loss, not mine! I'm out! I'm done. Perfect. Thank you! Thank you! There goes Mr. Goon! Look at her! Look! Come closer. Come closer! Look at Mr. Goon! Sandy. Mommy! Wait, look at them! Why are you still squealing like that, as if I didn't tell you the whole story already? Oh, come on! Even though I enjoy this show, I'm still annoyed because Sandy is not even a real person. How on earth will Mr. Goon fall in love with her? Explain that to me. They will end up together. They're holding hands! They're dancing! Look at them! Hey, cousin! Come here! Yo, cous! Come join us! Next time. Hey, Ollie! Where did you sleep last night? If your mom finds out about this, she'll get mad at me. ♪ Dancing the cha cha! ♪ ♪ Everybody dance! ♪ Hey! Stop teaching your brother a bunch of nonsense! Hey, cous! How's your audition? Did you get the part? Huh? For real? Such a shame since you're wearing your boss jacket. Leader (leather) jacket! That's enough fooling around. You, go take a shower because we'll have dinner in a while. You guys stop with the teasing. Hey, Ollie! Wait a second. A letter came for you. It looks important. And here's the guy we've been waiting for Ollie Francisco! Miss? Is this your cellphone? Do you want to take a selfie with me? Come, let’s take a selfie. Game? One, two, three! It's been two years already. I wonder where you are now. I'm going to sleep. Maybe you're sleeping already. Anyway, good night, sweet dreams, and I miss you! Taho! Hmm... Hey! I thought you said you don't need this? That this is our loss and not yours? I'm sorry. I'm here now, aren’t I? Also, it was really hot yesterday. I'm sorry. Okay. Here's your number. Good luck. Thank you. Alright! Hey! Okay, be my stand in first. What's taking you so long? It's 7 AM already! Where is it? Take a half step first. Half step to the left. Here's the coffee! Finally! Where did you buy this? In Brazil? He's crazy. Belle! Belle, here you go. The coffee is here, finally! Sorry! I'll show you the guy who threw a fit yesterday. There he is. Do you see him? Who? I'm blinded by the hotness of these guys. That guy! The one who’s first in line. That guy in front of you, he's number one! Oh, you're right! See? Mr. Goon, I have detected that you have a stiff neck. Sandy, do you really know what you’re doing? Are you sure you know how to massage properly? Don't you like it? I can stop. That's enough, Sandy. I'll just take a bath. I mean, I'm just going to sleep. Mr. Goon! I can help you take a bath! Take me with you! Guide him to the mark. I'm sure you've seen this version before, right? Yes. You can copy this version or make your own rendition, okay? Impress us, okay? That's hard to do. Rolling! Action! I am! Oh, my God! I am Ji-Hyun Goon! Don't forget that! I still own 60 percent of this company, so whatever I say goes! I will never allow Goon Corporation to create something that will breach people's privacy! - He's too much. - Yeah. But he's... We're still choosing the top 100 anyway. Let's include him. Let's give him a shot. Okay, cut! Let's take a five minute break. We've been at this for hours. Let's finish this now, Director. We're almost done anyway. Where are you? I have a surprise for you! Come out of the studio! Ollie Francisco is here! Come here, quick! Oh, Director, let's take a break. Five minutes to the bathroom! I'll be quick! Top 100! Three, two, one. Solid! Oppa! Oppa! Eka! What the hell happened to you? Where's Ollie? He went home already. Hey! Wait a second! He'll be back here tomorrow! Don't tire yourself. Come here! He auditioned for 'The Search For The Next Min-Jun Park.' He's actually shortlisted. A primetime show, the main guy! Really? Yes, but there's a lot of process to go through. - Can I come and watch here tomorrow? - What? Please, I can be your assistant! Please, Eka! Wow, the assistant has an assistant! Nice! Fine! I'll find a way. Just make sure you'll be here tomorrow. Really? Thank you so much! - You're such a friend! I love you! - Oh my. Oh my. Friend! Friend! Friend?! That's it? I'm tired of this system! Why don't you treat me to something for once? You're too much. Belle, call the next one. Director, I can't throw lines today. Can I have a substitute? Who do you have in mind? Me? You want me to do it? No, I have someone right here. She's the one doing Sandy's voice on the original show. Nice! Alright, let her do it. Okay, ready? Are you ready? Ready. Rolling. Five, four, three, two... Action! If you ask me, you cannot include love in a program. It supposed to be felt! If somebody loves you, you will see it on how they look at you, how they talk to you, and how they kiss you. But Mr. Goon, can't someone like me feel love? Can't it be included into my system? Can you love me, Mr. Goon? Why are you saying that? Sandy, you don't need that. You were made to serve humans. You were made to make my life easier. But what if I just feel it? Isn't that possible? What if they made my system so advanced that I can actually feel- Shh! Stop saying that, Sandy. You weren't made to love. Even I need to remind myself that you’re not human. That what I feel whenever I see you is wrong. When we talk, I know everything is just a big lie. A freak of nature. I can't even explain it to you myself. What if I told you I love you? This can't be. Sandy, this is not right. This is not right! Cut! I knew this kid has potential. That's right. Ouch! Watch it! Hey! The reason why our economy is collapsing is because of people choose to flirt before work! Ollie! Yes! Yes! You got in? Congrats! Yes! - Congrats! Congrats! - Auntie! I got it! Top 15, baby! Woohoo! Solid! Come on, let's eat! My treat! Congrats! Top 15, baby! Atta boy! Atta boy! Sir Ollie? Are you Sir Ollie? - Yes? - I'm your Taxi Pool.

If you hit them they'll blame you for it, am I right? Yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry! My phone… How long have you been there? I've been here before you. By the way, I'm Aimee. I was at your audition earlier. Ollie Francisco. Really, you were there? Yeah. I can't remember you. Mr. Goon, it's me. I'm Sandy. I was the one throwing lines with you earlier. I'm Aimee. My real name is Aimee. Wow, that's nice. Wait, are you a ventriloquist? No, I'm a dubber. I'm the voice of Soo-Mi in all of her shows on the network. Soo-Mi? For real? So that's why, earlier, I can totally picture her talking to me. As if she's the one throwing lines with me. I don't know, I'm really such a big fan of her. She's my ultimate crush. And now she's as beautiful as ever playing the role of Sandy. So beautiful! But anyway, thank you for helping me out earlier. You're really a great help. It's nothing, really! Nice one! Aimee! What happened? There's a cockroach! A cockroach? What, why? Where is it? There it goes. It flew like a butterfly and went out! What the hell, Aimee? I thought something bad happened to you. Go get dressed now. But it was flying. Bomb! Bomb! What's happening? There's a bomb, ma'am! What? A bomb?! There's a bomb threat! A bomb threat! Bomb? Go over here! Go straight! Let's go! Hurry! Miss? Oh, Aimee. What's happening? They said there's a bomb. Bomb? Come here! Quick! It's a dead end! Let's go upstairs. Wait, wait a second! Hurry! - Wait. - Okay, just stay there. Help! Are you okay? Have a seat. Do you have asthma? No, I don't. I'm a blue baby, that's all. Blue baby? Like those Avatar things? Not like that. Do I look like an alien to you? I was born with a congenital heart disease. How do I explain this to you… My heart lacks some passageways. That's why it doesn't function quite well. I even went through an operation when I was a baby. But you're okay? You don't have any device on your heart… like an android or something? You're overacting! There's no device. I'm not like Sandy. But I do her voice. Can you tell me your story using Sandy's voice? Okay. So as I was saying, I'm not really allowed to do a lot of physical activities and anything stressful because my heart weakens and my chest tightens. When I was in elementary school, I'm always exempted during Physical Education because it'll tire me. I took Library Science as a course, so I won't get tired since it's just books and I just go to the library. If my heart doesn't get enough oxygen, that's where my illness attacks. Earlier, I was so scared because I've been running and-- I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! I didn't... I didn't mean it! If you want you can slap me-- Why did you slap me? Because you told me to! And that was a kiss! It has to be consensual! It needs my consent! Why did you kiss me? That hurts! Oh, my God! What are you two doing?! And here at the fire exit? Unbelievable! You're embarrassing! No, sir. There was a bomb threat and we panicked and went here. Actually, I was even calling for help, because we got locked in here. That was hours ago! It was just a false alarm. They caught the guy spreading that bomb threat text. He didn't get the part in an audition, that's why he did that. Really? So I can go back to the audition now? Alright, I'm going now. Miss, go follow your boyfriend. You might get locked up in here and, we might get locked up in here and I'm already a family man. And... Sir, excuse me, you're being creepy now. …and doing it here in a fire exit? Oh no. Miss! Get inside, quickly. Okay, get in line. Fix your line. You do your thing. They're complete. Okay, announcement! Announcement! Wow, an announcement for an announcement! That's how I roll. We're cancelling today's audition, because of the bomb threat. That's why, we decided that we'll just choose our Top Ten now. Okay. First we have… Luis Gragera, Joseph Santos, Mark Castaneda, Ollie Franscisco, Sherwin Yao, ET Sanchez, Yes! Sherwin Abel, Michael De Guzman, Ibarra Gonzales, and Neil Arce. Hey! Hey! Your Oppa Ollie got in the Top Ten. Oh, really? What happened to you? Eka... What? Have you ever had your first kiss? Yes, of course! Why are you asking? Remember how everyone was panicking earlier and... Oppa Ollie, he and I got trapped inside the fire exit. I don't know things were going fast. I was just telling him a story then he kissed me on the lips. Wait. You guys got trapped, you were just talking and... he kissed you on the lips? Pervert! He's a pervert! No, not like that. Does that mean anything? Does it mean he likes me too? Don't think about it that way. He just kissed you. so you'll shut up. It doesn't mean anything. It's just a kiss. Don't get your hopes up. That's it? Is that all kisses are now? No meaning at all? There aren’t any ugly people nowadays, Aimee. Only people who don't know how to fix themselves up. Okay, class. Nowadays, we seldom need books because we now have Google… [bell ringing] So, why are you helping me again? Because I can see your potential. Just because you're a one hit wonder doesn't mean you don't deserve a second chance, right? And if ever you become famous, don't you forget me, and also my friend. Who's your friend again? Soo-Mi? Sandy? Hello, Mr. Goon! So pretty! You really outdid yourself today! Is it okay? Don't I look like a gay? Why? You have a problem with gays? What if I slap you on the face? So Ollie, do you recognize my friend? Aimee! You're Aimee! Wow, you look different! I just had the time to fix up. A lot of time. Aimee, about that fire exit thing. That’s nothing. It's okay now. It's okay now? Thank you! I'm grateful to you both for helping me. Sure. It's his fault. I really didn't want to come here but he insisted. Right? - Oh, I insisted? Yes, I did? - Yes, insisted. Yes, you. Yeah, you did. Let's go inside the studio so you can rehearse since I insisted that you come here to internalize the script. Okay, let me check. - Let's do this bit. Have you memorized it? - Game. - Game. - Okay. Good morning, Mr. Goon. Oh, why did you install that app? Didn't you say I'd be more convincing if I knew a few things about humanities. I wasn't made to sing, but my animatronic capablities will allow me to dance. You know how to dance? Are you serious? Yeah, do you want to try? Okay. Game. Is this what happiness feels like, Mr. Goon? My circuits feel like they're about to explode. I can't explain it. Sandy, you don't have to explain every single thing that you’re feeling. I just want to know the meaning of it all, Mr. Goon. If I'm a real woman, are we still going to talk like this? Sandy, if you're a real woman, we wouldn't be talking. I'll just kiss you. Does that mean if you kiss me again, it'll be meaningful? Does that mean you want to be with me? Are you happy? Are you happy to be with me? Are you hinting on something? Wait, wait! Is that a question here? I don't think that's in the script. Didn't you say you're going to kiss me again? What does that mean? In the fire exit, remember? That doesn't mean anything? No, it didn't mean anything. It's just like method acting. Like what we're doing right now. We're pretending I'm Mr. Goon and you're Soo-Mi-- I mean, Sandy. We're just playing their characters. And plus, you told me you're fine with it now. Ah, yeah. That's fine now. Anyway, I'll go ahead. My parents are looking for me. Aimee… Can I have your number? Just in case I'll need your help again? Yeah, sure. Auntie. Look at what your mom sent you! So many! Hey cous! I took this green one. You don't like green, right? These shoes look better on me. It has red on it. You don't like red, right? I'll take this, okay? Thank you! Cous, I took mine as well! You don't like blue, right? You can have these chocolates, though. But if you don't want those, give it to us! Hey! Stop that, you freeloaders! No, it's fine. Really. See? It's fine! Ollie! Hello! You guys are always… Oh! Your mom is now online! Your mom and dad! Say thank you to them! - They've been waiting for you. - Hi, auntie! Thank you for the gifts! Thank you. Thank you! I've been trying to contact you, but you're not answering. I have good news for you. Your VISA got approved. They sent you an invitation from the Embassy. Oh, really? That's nice. Aren't you happy? We've been waiting for this. Isn't this what we planned? It's not that I'm not happy, Dad. I'm just thinking about all the adjustments that I have to do when I get there. But son, you can still do whatever it is you're doing there over here. Which one? Becoming an actor in a major network? Dad, I'll become an actor here. Here we go again with that acting thing! Dad, Mom, I have a better chance here. Did you know I made it to the Top Ten already? And I did that all by myself! Ollie! What's wrong with you? You don't get to talk to your parents everyday and you're acting like this. Don't you want to be with them? Auntie, it’s not that I don't want to be with them. Even if I go there, it'll still feel like I'm invisible to them. Like before, it's like I'm not even there. Your parents are still your parents no matter what happens. And plus, they didn't abandon you. They're working hard for you. But Auntie, I feel different with this one. Just give me this shot. And if this doesn't work out, I'll give up trying to be an actor. You don't have to prove anything to me. Can you be my Sandy again? Cut! Get out! - Next! - Let's go! Next! - That one passed your audition? - I don't-- did it? I didn't screen that one! I don't know. Next! Stand here, in the marker. Talk to the camera. That's Sandy, okay? Okay. That's Sandy. Make it work! Let's go! Let's go! Okay, Director. Let's do this. Don't mess it up! Let's go! Let's go! Five, four, three, two... Action! Sandy, I know there's a lot of things Science can't explain. And for sure one of them is what I'm feeling. I know you’re not real. And it's impossible for you to be feeling the same way as me. But I know that I love you. Yes, Android 5000. I love you. I can't imagine myself without you. I can’t see myself alone without you with me. Cut! Perfect! Oh, my God! What an amazing performance! Oh, my God! Very good! Because of that! The part is yours. Really? Congratulations! Who's that? Aren't we finished with Sandy's audition already? Didn't Cheska get the part? Yes, Director. She's just a dancer passing by. I'll bring her to the other studio. But she's good. What the hell, Aimee? Your outfit even made a scene in front of our director! Do you even get paid for that? Of course not. I do this for the love! I'm just helping him out. Oh, really? You're just helping. Wow. I'm warning you! Don't give up everything for him. My God! Your makeup might take you nowhere! Don't say I didn't warn you. You're on your own. I'm busy. Hello, Ollie. Where did you go? Let's have lunch. I have school today. I'm about to leave. Ah, that's a shame. But I can go tomorrow. Good! Where do you want to eat? Just name it. Text me, okay? Okay. Bye. I got the part of Min-Jun Park! Wow! Solid! Fist bump! Fist bump! I'll go tell your mother. I'm sure she'll be happy about this. Wait, auntie. Let's keep this a secret, please. Don't tell them yet. Really? Are you sure? Yes. Let's celebrate! Cheers! Good day! You know what, Aimee. I don't know how to thank you. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't get chosen. Don't mention it. Wait… [Sandy's voice] Don't mention it. You're the best! That's what my daddy used to tell me. Really? I'm the best. And because you're the best, I have a gift for my real-life Sandy. Contact lenses. Ahh... These are the contact lenses that'll make your eyes look bigger. You know? The ones that Sandy is using. Wow! Contact lenses. Nice! Wait, this is what's going to complete the surprise. Tada! There! Those are the brands that Sandy uses. What do you call those... Yeah, these are the brands. It's so nice! Great timing, because I'm running out of these. And because of that, let's take a selfie. Because I want my followers to get to know you. Wait. Game. One, two...there! Beautiful! I'll post this. Do you want to order now? - Okay, I'll keep this now. - Okay. Okay. What do you want? Not like that. We're in a Korean restaurant, so you say it like this "Annyeong Haseyo!" "Anong Sa'yo!" (What do you want?) "Annyeong Haseyo!" (Good day) "Anong Sa'yo!" "Annyeong Haseyo!" "Anong Sa'yo!" "Annyeong Haseyo!" Look at these crazy kids. "Anong Sa'yo!" "Annyeong Haseyo!" Waiter. "Annyeong Haseyo!" - "Annyeong Haseyo!" - "Anong Sa'yo!" Aimee! Aimee! Since when did history became fiction? When you can't figure out what's real and what isn't. And because of everything you did for me, I'm here for you. This is for your heart and we got to stay fit. Especially you. And me, of course, so I'll really look like Mr. Goon. You look fit to me. Let me see? You're already fit. Fit, yes. But I still need improvement. So we inhale and exhale first, okay? - Game? - Okay, game. Close your eyes. Inhale, exhale. There. Inhale, exhale. And you hold your breath. Inhale, hold, exhale. Inhale, hold, exhale. There, can you feel it? Yes, I can feel it. Inhale. Inhale! Exhale! Exhale! Enough! This isn't right! We shouldn't be together! We shouldn't… We shouldn't-- Nope, you can't cheat. No! Look here. Stoop down a little. Ouch! Alright, from the top! There! You smiled! No, I didn't! [mumbling] One, two, three! Be quiet inside the library, please! - Go! Faster! You can do it! - Ouch! Wait. Ouch! Never say never! I'll help you. Come on. Game! Are you sure? Yeah, climb up already. One, two, three...Go! Alright, ready! Hold on tighter! Alright, I'll hold on. One, two, three! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, don't you want to get away from the rain? Did you know, this is the first time I bathed in the rain. They won't let me do this when I was a kid because…you know. Same here. Thank you. [Sandy's voice] Thank you, Mr. Goon. You don't have to do that every time. It's not necessary. Okay. Alright, I have three knock knock jokes for you. Three. If I make you laugh, you'll have to treat me. Alright. - There's a sad joke, - Okay. then scary, and then happy. Let's do the sad one first, okay? Okay. Knock knock. Who's there? Hu. Hu? Hu who? Hu hu! Huhuhuhuhu! - Okay, that's a little funny. - Wait. Next! Next! Next! Next! The second one, the scary joke! Scary? Knock knock. Who's there? Ah. Ah Who? Awoooo! That's corny! Last! The last one is a happy one, of course. Happy? Go on. Knock knock. Who's there? Iyak (cry). You said it's happy then why say Iyak (cry)? Yes! Iyak who? Iyakhooooo! (Yahoo!) You laughed! You have to treat me! She's here! Cheska is here! Cheska's here! - Let's go prepare her wardrobe. - Finally! Cheska! Hi, Cheska! Oh, my God! - It's been a while! - Good morning! You’re so beautiful! Thank you! The look is very Gigi Hadid Fall Winter 2016! Yes, exactly! I had the entire set from New York. That's nice! I'm sorry, Director. My voice is still hoarse from last night's shoot. Oh! Really? It’s not even noticeable. Alright, I'll introduce you to your new leading man. Come here. This is Ollie. This is your new leading man. And this is Cheska. You know Cheska, right? She's going to be your new leading lady. Hi! Nice to meet you. I hope you're aware that I'm doing this out of sheer generosity, and I'm doing you a huge favor. I know you're a newbie, so you better prove your worth. Thank you! Thank you. Bubba, where to? Makeup! Makeup! Closer. - Very good! That's nice. - Okay. Closer, closer! Stylist, please fix their clothes. Fix Cheska's hair. Mr. Goon's acting is amazing! Nice! Nice! Okay, now look at me. Alright, let's do the screentest. Give them the script. Let's go! Guys, please read through your scripts and let me know once you're okay with it. Double time! Double time! Read through the scripts! - I'm ready! - Ready? Alright! - Director. They're ready. - Okay, please ready the camera? What? Camera rolling! Ready! Three, two, one...Action! It's not right for you to love me, Mr. Goon. I understand now that we're different from each other. I'm not human. I don't have the capacity to love like you do. Where is that coming from, Sandy? Why are you saying those words? I will do my best to make this right. I'll think of a way. Even if it means losing all my riches. Just to make this right. Okay, cut! That's enough for today. Cut! Cut. Enough. Good job, Cheska. - Thank you, Director! - Very good! Okay! But, Director, can't say the same for this actor you picked. I'm sorry, Cheska. You know how newbies are. Please bear with him. - Thanks again, Director. - Good job! Bubba! I'm here! Honestly, Ollie. You should do a better performance next time. Just like when you auditioned. Didn't you see Cheska? She just breezed through it like it's nothing. I'm not impressed. Okay? Yes, Director. I'm sorry. Ollie! Aimee! Aimee! Why? What happened? I really can't do this without you, Aimee! Wait a minute, I can't breathe. You're so dramatic. What happened? I have a huge favor to ask. What's that? Can you accompany me on our first day of shoot? She's here! Madame, Cheska's here! Welcome, Cheska! That's not Cheska! You’re wrong! That's not Cheska! Stop me. No, you're a girl. You're a girl! You're just assisting him today, and yet you're wearing a costume. Let me be. I just want to be supportive. Is Ollie there? Yes, he's already inside. Wait, can you hold this? What did you do? I am so flattered by your effort! Thanks! Wait. What chapter are you in my fanclub? Cheska Forever East Manila? You guys are so great! Don't worry, I'll do a shout out for you guys later. Where to? There, over there. Mr. Goon, you have to trust me. Your betterment is my top priority. - You can’t shake away my doubts, Sandy. - Ollie. Aimee! Thank you! I told you I'll find a way for you. There you go. We have a winner! Don't mind them. Let’s go through your lines, so you won't get nervous. We practiced this already, right? [Sandy's voice] Mr. Goon, you have to trust me. Your betterment is my top priority. You can’t shake away my doubts, Sandy. I know you're scared. Breathe. I can't explain my feelings for you, Sandy. I know you can read me better than anyone else. I can't imagine my life without you. Mr. Goon, don't think like that. I'm still just a program. I can be gone in a blink. We're different, Mr. Goon. Don't forget that. Cut! Very good! Wait. Wait. You're good! Tissue, please! Excuse me. Eka, right? Yes, Ms. Cheska? Who's that fangirl hanging out with Ollie? I thought she was one of mine. Actually, she's not a fan. She's the dubber from the original show. She's a friend of Ollie. Friend? But why is she taking care of him like a girlfriend? Is she his nanny? This Ollie guy is crazy for bringing his nanny here in a Sandy costume. What a lunatic! What a nerd! She's even wearing a costume! - Five, four, three, two! - Action! Sandy, upgrade my firewall security to level two, okay? And make sure to upgrade yours as well. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. As you wish, Mr. Goon. Cut! Very good! My competitor cannot find out that my personal assistant is an android. So please Sandy, never leave this house without my permission. I understand, Mr. Goon. I just wanted to look for information that is not onli-- That's final! Okay? Cut! Good take! Okay. Let's just change angles now. Where are you? The food is ready now. Didn't I tell you that we are having a party for our anniversary? Sorry, mom. I need to finish our project. We need to submit this tomorrow. Hey, Aimee! Dinner time is almost over, aren't you going to eat? Ollie! You are so good today! Are you inspired? I agree. He definitely looks like he's inspired. Who could it possibly be? Director, I know he's got someone. That girl who was throwing lines with at the standby area. Really? Is this the girl cosplaying as... - Yeah, that's her. - Sandy? That dubber during the audition. Who is she? Is she your girlfriend? - Wow, you're such a flirt! - What?! Cheska, have a seat. What girlfriend? You can’t have one! I mean, even if it's just a rumor, you can't! We're a love team. You can't be seen with other girls. The fans will get jealous. Okay? How will you become famous if you don't have fans. Right, Director? Yeah. That fangirl is your girlfriend, right? Yeah, she's your girlfriend, isn't she? - Director, I'll go ahead on the set. - Yes? Get the sequence guide! Hey, Aimee! I've been looking for you everywhere! I'm going home now. They're waiting for me. Hey. Mommy, I'm very sorry. It's okay. Did you eat already? I'm okay. Where's Daddy? He's in our room now. You know how he is. Talk to him tomorrow. Go ahead and rest now. Go fix that thing! It's not balanced! Leave the set, guys! Leave the set! Five, four, three, two... Action! Mr. Goon, I detected that your heartbeat is racing. What are you feeling right now? My heart is…my heart… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cut! What is wrong with you? We're almost done here and you keep messing up! Go talk to your actor. How many times have we done this? Internalize your character. Relax. Think about the person you love the most. Think about it. Tell me when you're ready. Okay, are you ready? We're ready, Director! Alright, let's go! Okay! Ready! Five, four, three, two...Action! Mr. Goon, I detected that your heartbeat is racing. What are you feeling right now? What I'm feeling? For the first time, I felt that there's something even more important than money. That there is something more than the craziness this world has to offer. That there is someone worth more than my life. And that's you. It's you. You're the one I love. Yes, you're the one I'm in love with. Cut! Perfect! Oh, my God! Okay, pack up! Not bad for a newbie! Thank you. By the way, I'm having a party soon. My assistant will send you the details, okay? Sure, sure. What is it? Daddy! I'm sorry, please! I won't do it again. Damn right you won't, because you’re not allowed to do that dubbing thing anymore. You scared your mother and I last night. We thought something bad happened to you. If you didn't have that dubbing job, you can get home earlier and finish your projects on time. It's just going to get you in to trouble. What if you get kidnapped? We don't have the money to pay for your ransom. Daddy, please. I said I'm sorry. Did you eat already? Not yet. Alright, let's eat with your mother. I'll set the table. Anna, you take over for now. We're here on the set of Program For Love to interview the main stars, Cheska and Ollie. - Hello! - Hello! Cheska, what can you say about your new love team with Ollie Francisco? Well, it's okay. He's handsome and nice. And, he can act. I think we'll have a fun time doing the show together. Now that you're in a love team with Cheska, is there a chance that you'll become a couple? I don't want to speak too soon. She's pretty and anything can happen. Miss! Miss! Do you still have some hearts (chicken)? I ran out. - Sandy! Sandy! It's me. Activate! Sandy! - Daddy, why is it like this?! Sandy! Sandy! It's me. Activate! Sandy! - Sandy won't wake up! Poor Mr. Goon! What happened to her? Please, don't do this to me! This isn't real! Congratulations to me! Cheers! Cheers, everyone! Look who's here! Drink for me? I'm not planning on drinking tonight. Oh come on, don't be such a buzz kill! Just one drink. And that's Cheska who's asking you! Come on, drink it. For me? Aimee, I want to talk to you soon. I'm just here at Cheska's party at The Fort. Hello, Eka. Where are you? For you! Go! Go! Cheers! Nice. Nice. Cheers. Cheers! One, two, three! You know what? Let's dance! Aimee, this is the last straw! I don't like sneaking out! If something happens to you, it'll be my fault! This is the last one, I promise. Thank you. That's why I'm here. Excuse me. Are you guys on the guest list? No, we're not. Like I said, it's more fun here! We'll stay here. Hey, I know you! You know me, right? Go! Party! - Only her. - Okay. Hey, they're upstairs. What are you doing here? Maybe she's fetching her master. Good thing they let you in here. I know they have a strict dress code. Too bad you didn’t bring your maid costume with you! If she did, then they definitely won't let her in here! No tacky girls allowed! So tacky! Tacky! She's wearing too much make up. Look at her hair! Wait. Tell me something, Ollie. Is this tacky fangirl your girlfriend? Ollie? No, of course not. No. No. No. No. Bye! Here's the thing. It's like this. You know... We're jerks. Who said that? We attest to that. Okay. But what you did to Aimee, that's straight up bad. It's not just bad, he went legendary! But seriously, you shouldn’t be a jerk to girls. They expect that from bad boys like us already. Don't be a jerk, cous. Just stay cool. Yeah, keep it together! I'm sorry but what happened to our daughter is no joke. Did you know she almost died? That's why I hope you respect our decision to keep her away from all of this, especially from you. We love Aimee so much. But it's better if you just stay away from her. So no one will get hurt again. We don't want this to happen to her ever again. Her heart might not make it. Ollie, remember we're talking about our daughter's life here. That's why I hope you understand. Yes, I understand. Bubba, what's our schedule for today? Hi, Ollie! How are you? You didn't come back to my party. I had to rush my friend to the hospital, remember? Oh, yeah. That P.A. (Personal Assistant)! How is she? Is she dead? Aimee is not my P.A., okay? How dare you make fun of what you did to her? Did you know she almost died because of what you did to her? Excuse me? So now it's my fault? It's her fault because she keeps on trying to get herself in places that she clearly doesn't belong in! She's not one of us and she'll never will be! Wow, you really have such a shallow view on the world. Look at you, Cheska! Not everything revolves around you and your hang ups! Say that again? Do you realize who you're talking to? Ollie, may I remind you. Even though we're a love team, I'm still The Cheska that can have you removed from this show, or on any other show here in this network! It doesn't matter if we already had our first day of shoot. I can pay for everything just to make sure you won't get any jobs in this network! Then do it. You know what? You made me realize something. Getting to where you are right now doesn't guarantee decency. I used to say I want to be like you. But I was wrong. It's not worth it. I don't want to be like you. What? Another commercial?! Full of suspense. Why did you bother getting me something to drink? You'll get tired. No, I'm okay now. Breaking news! There is a new search for Mr. Goon! Let's find out what happened. We are here with the director of Program For Love to ask her why they are in search for another Min-Jun Park. That Ollie has too many issues! He's been fighting with all of us. He's giving Cheska a hard time! Look at what he did to Cheska! He's still a newbie, he hasn't been verified, and yet he's acting like that! I don't even know why we picked him in the first place. So, does that mean that Ollie is out of the show? Definitely. Mom, I'm just going to study upstairs. Son... Mom... Your dad is on duty today. We heard what happened. How are you? I'm okay, Mom. Are you sure? Mom, I'm sorry. I'm going there with you. Ollie, it's okay. You shouldn't apologize to us. You didn't do anything wrong. We're the ones who should be sorry. I'm sorry I didn't believe you, and I didn't listen to you about your dreams. You know what, what you said was true. You really did all this by yourself. Sorry. I know that you know what the right thing to do is. Just remember that we’re here for you. We'll support you and we're very proud of you. Mom, thank you. Thank you so much. I miss you guys so much. I love you, son. Are you okay? You were right, mom. Your world will change. And your heart will beat so fast. It's as if you're trying to chase something you shouldn't even be chasing. It's tiring. I'm so weak. Aimee, that's what being in love is like. But there are lots of love out there. But the love that lasts is the one that's not complicated. It's the one that you don't have to chase. It's okay, we're here for you. And your dad and I talked about your dubbing thing. And he agreed to let you do it. So if you can still go back, do it. Thank you, Mommy. From now on I swear, I'll be focused! It's a promise. You promise? I promise. Don't cry. Come on, you'll look ugly. Hello? Yes, I'm almost there. And that's the story of the Legend of The Atis! Cut! Good take! Let's go to the next set. Fabulous! Yes! What's happening? Bomb! What's happening? There's a bomb! Bomb! - There's a bomb! - A bomb! There's a bomb! We have to leave there's a... Aimee… Aimee, I'm sorry. I didn't know what I wanted back then. Sorry, it took me so long to realize how important you are to me. I thought I was alone in life. But all along, I am surrounded by people who love and support me, and you're one of them. I'm sorry I didn't appreciate you the way I should've. I've kept myself from this truth. It's so amazing to fall in love. And it's even more amazing, if you're in love with someone. Aimee, please. Please, give me a chance to show you how much I appreaciate you, and all the things you've done for me. Especially for my dreams. Aimee, you are special to me. Okay, fine. Apology accepted. But on one condition. What condition? Give me a hug. Hug? A very tight one. Go. Hug? Alright, then don't. Oh, my God! It's you two again! This generation is really something else! When there's a bomb, there's… My God! Can't you guys look f or someplace else? Go look for a place where there's privacy and not just anywhere! Am I awake? Am I still dreaming? Is this real? Is this a dream? Wake me up! Quick! Quick! Ouch! Ouch! It's so amazing! It's real! Before I used to dream of being here with you. But now, it finally happened. It's possible. Of course it is. Everything is possible. That's what I learned from you. And I want to thank you... for coming into my life. Oops! Wait a second! Okay, okay. Before you kiss me, I want to know what this means. Isn't it obvious? I'm not Mr. Goon and you're not Sandy. Aimee Bautista, I'm Ollie Francisco, and I wholeheartedly love you. I love you, Aimee. I love you, too... Oppa? I love you, Ollie! - Let's go there! Come on! - Let's go.
