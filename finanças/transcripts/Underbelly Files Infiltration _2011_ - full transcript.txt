JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:"N'Drangheta", a hard word to get your tongue around. So let's just call it whatit is, the Calabrian Mafia. They arrived in Australiaearly last century, and established a power base in the farming country of New South Wales. Because that's what they were, peasant farmers. They grew fruit and veggies, all right, but that wasn't their only cash crop. When marijuana came along, theycouldn't believe their luck. They went into the dope businessbig time and made a fortune. And like Mafia back home in Italy, they protected their pot ofgold with tooth and claw. I swear, I didn't do it. Didn't we pay you enough? Plenty. I never took the stuff. Just tell the truth. You stole from the cropwe pay you to look after. You're gonna off me anyway. Just tell me the truth. And you won't knock me? There is a chance. I pinched 100 plants. You've got hundreds of thousands out here. Listen, I sold them, but I'llget them back to you, OK? It's not a problem. I've got a bit now. I'll give you a bit-- no, please! I told the truth. I told the truth. Yes, you did. And you will go to heaven. [gunshot] With a limp. And when God says, "why do youlimp?", you tell him the truth, too. You thieved. No, don't! JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Over the years, they notched up dozens of violent murders. Police couldn't ignore them forever. But how do you crack open anorganization like the Mafia? They're a family. They don't trust outsiders. They never talk business on the phone. And they never roll over. [speaking italian] JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:For a long time, the N'Drangheta was definitelyin the "too hard" basket. And then along came a courageouscop who had other ideas. His name? Colin McLaren. [music playing] SONG: It's a jungle out there. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:In the 1990s, the Australian governmentset up police operations across the country to findout exactly what the Mafia was up to and stop them. I was part of the Victorian taskforce, and that's the man I'mtalking about, Colin McLaren. And that's his team, investigators, Italian translator, squirrels, including me. I was a squirrel. Nothing to do with acorns. It was our nickname for surveillance operatives. And there were the bean counters. Loyalty is the core of N'Drangheta's success. You can't simply join N'Drangheta. You have to be born into N'Drangheta family. N'Drangheta grows by marriagesbetween the families. Antonio Russo is married to Maria Ricci. She's the daughter of Carlo Ricci. He's been the boss of theGriffith Shebang for eons. Antonio has inherited the reins from Carlo. Blood givesN'Drangheta its strength. Blood and absolutely no mercy. [screaming] Hi, Dad. Love you. Got soccer tomorrow, Dad. When was the last time I forgot, eh? Never. Come on. Ciao. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:We started by buggering up their marijuanabusiness, using satellite surveillance to bust their crops15 years before Google Earth. Three fucking crops in a month. Fucking satellite. How can the fucking thing see a marijuana crop from outer fucking space? They're costing us a lot of money. Antonio, we stop planting. Agreed? [gunshots] There. Fixed the fucker. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Except, Antonio Russo was more than up to the challenge. [music playing] But every step he took,we were right behind him. Excuse me, you got a sec? Um, I'm a bit lost. So I'm looking for-- what is it-- Market Street? Do you know where that is? Market street, that one. So they must have unloaded20,000 little marijuana babies. But they can't be going to grow them in there. There's not enough room. No. Mr. Russo's got somewhere else in mind. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Antonio's plan? Hydroponics on a massive scale. Which needed a huge shed, tons of equipment, and some poor fool who was desperate enough to let his property be used by the Mafia. They're tooling up to grow under lights. They're shifting the marijuanababies into this shed here, outside of sigh of the satellites, put them under growing lights,turn on the irrigation. $5 million worth. Antonio Russo connected to the plants? Rosario Torcaso connected to the shed. So we've got more than enough to do them for conspiracy to cultivate. Conspiracy's piss-weak, Roger. This is the top N'Drangheta brass. As soon as they're in theirshed with the growing lights turned on, they're up to their eyeballs in cultivation, possession,and distribution. 10 years, six years to serve. That cuts the N'Drangheta head off. So we're looking at what, a month? When they're in, we'll move. I'll pencil a month into the timeline. The clock's ticking, remember? JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: A month? Even a humble squirrel like me thought it was ridiculously optimistic. It would never have occurred to the old guy to grow crops under cover. Not in a million years. But Antonio Russo, thisprick thinks outside the box. He's-- A bright bastard. Hmm. OK, the Shepparton farmer, he-- he telephoned to Antonio Russo. The farmer says, hiswife not change her mind. She wants nothing to dowith N'Drangheta, full stop. And Antonio says thathe's relaxed about things. He understands. He says to wait 12 monthsand then reassess things. Fuck me. What do you wanna go to Griffith for? There is no guaranteethey'll ever use the shed. And even if they do, we can't sit around on our asses, waiting for 12 months. There's N'Drangheta here in Melbourne. Footsoldiers. Roger, we've got to take down Antonio Russo! I've never been to Griffith. I just wanna go up there, sniffaround the place, suss out-- We've already spent afortune on the squirrels travel and meal allowance in Griffith. Roger, you said so yourself, all right? The clock is ticking. We've got a two year statutory life. We're already eight months in. This is our one chance. Now, I just have to find another angle in. I'm sorry, but I don't think so. No. Can we clean up those marijuana babies? Yup, waiting to speak to the local DI now. I thought we'd dummy up a drugraid, arm's length from us, you know? Local boys and girls acting on local intel. I'll concoct something. Good, that's exactlywhat Colin and I thought. If the N'Drangheta get a whiff of us now, they'll go absolutely to ground. Good call. Griffith's lovely this time of year, isn't it? Squirrels, Who's up forshowing Collie-wol the sights and delights of Griffith? I've had a gutful of the dump. I've got an appointment with my gynecologist. Yeah, if you promiseRoger won't shit himself. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Fools rush in, right? Colin, I'm sorry. You've offered no tangiblejustification for the outlay in TAs and MAs in excess of those already allocated against Griffin. Whatever, Roger. We're here, mate. [music playing] [phone ringing] [speaking italian] Antonio was told that themarijuana babies were busted. He's very angry. Very angry is good. It might unsettle him. Thanks, Sandra. Antonio Russo's humble abode. Here he comes, the man himself. [music playing] Local palace of dreams. Eau de stale beer. Yeah, I remember that cigarette smell from six months ago, too. Ah, two G&Ts, please. Our lucky day, 11 o'clock,two tables pushed together, the dirty dozen. Let's squirrel, squirrel. [speaking italian] A local fucking uniform copper found the stuff. [speaking italian] OK. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Carlo Ricci, Rosario Torcaso, Antonio Russo, the prize. The man who had to come up with a new business plan before the family looked for a new boss. Colin knew it was a golden opportunity. But without being family,without being blood, how could he even start a conversation? There you go. Grazie. Come here, come here. I've got something for you. What you got for me? You put your little hand here. But if you win, you share with me. I know what he wants toshare with you, sweetheart. [chuckling] I've had a vision, so go with me. Just stay here. Excuse me. Has anyone played this one recently? No. Beauty. See, I've got this theory thatthese are programmed to pay out after a period of inactivity. A scientific theory, of course. There's no system. Trust me. I do know the people whoown these machines, though. Oh. They're sitting overthere, if you wanna complain. I wouldn't. Nah, it's a quick and a dead world these days. Make a dollar anyway you can. It's thirsty work, this. What are you drinking? Rum. I'm Sara, Herlihy. Hi, Sara. Cole Goodwin. - Cole? Yeah. Like as in "coal" Newcastle kind of coal? No, C-O-L-E. - Oh. - Old family name. Really? A tradition? That's so good. Where you from? Melbourne. I love Melbourne. I've never been there, but I just-- I know I'd love it. What do you do? Ah, self-employed. I'm an art dealer. Wow, I love art. Yeah? Yeah. Can you-- so just excuse me just a sec. Yeah. Hey, boys. I'll see you later, yeah? [speaking italian] Well, you're a naughty man. Hey, Sara, I can bepretty fucking naughty, too. I'll see you later. OK, ciao. Nice tits. Thank you. Nice shirt. Could you show some respect? Hi, lover. My name's Cole Goodwin. I'm a Melbourne art dealer, and we're overnighting here on our way to Broken Hill to Pro Hart's Gallery. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Now it all became stunningly crystal clear to me. My team leader was flyingby the seat of his pants. But what did I know? I was only a squirrel. I love Pro Hart. He does key rings. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:For the next two hours, Colin's strategy was to get Sara very drunk. I had a job. In Broken Hill? No, no, here at Griffith Library. Fair dinkum? Hmm. But I'm friendly with the wrongItalians, so they said no. So no job. Bastards. Yeah. Well, it's because-- come here. Because they're the Mafia. N'Drangheta. They're, um, Calabrian Mafia. They're my boys. Yeah. But they're my only friends here. Sorry I'm late. Traffic. What have I missed? We're infiltrating the N'Drangheta. Cole Goodwin, art dealer, will have cards, brochures, and stationeryprinted up inside 24 hours. And the Pro Hart keyrings are organized, mate. Good stuff, mate. Roger, good morning. Infiltration? Yup. Jude and I found theperfect back to ride in on. Female associate desperate for friends. There's no way into the N'Drangheta. You heard Vito. What's more, Jude is only a squirrel. The art world has a seriously-- All right, she's a very good squirrel. Yeah, she is, mate. But the art world has aseriously shonky underbelly. But she-- That's our angle, and that's what's happening. So you're prepared to risk Jude's life? No, I am. Infiltration isn't undercover. Undercover is pretending to be a waiter, a cab driver for a couple of weeks. Infiltration is about burrowinginto your target's heart, winning their trust, andliving their lives with them for however long it takes. As long as they don't twigto you first and kill you. If you're up for this, I'll be glad. And if you're not, thenI'll understand completely. If you think I can do it. It's not what I think. It's going to be your life at risk. Yours if I screw up. Yeah, but I've beenthere, and I've done it, OK? I know the risks. So I want an audio linkback to this office, Tiny. But I'm not wearing a wire, OK? I hate the things. And this operation is longterm, so way too risky. Coward? Yeah, got it in one. I've got a mobile phone I've been having a bit of a dick around with.- Yup. Technically, it's still in R&D, but the bugger's testingits little plastic head off. Functioning mobile phone. Push 5-1 on the keypad,enables it as a transmitter. Transmission mode cancels phone capabilities, so no one can call youwhen you're transmitting. You're a star, Tiny. You're a scholar, Cole. One other thing, it sucks battery power in transmission mode. I'm working on it, but take spare batteries. Crates of them. Yeah, right. The Calabrian Mafia? You're insane. I mean, we're Sicilian. We can be evil. Those Calabrians are seriouslydangerous mothers, mate. That's not a caponata. That's not Sicilian, mate. That's-- that's a skip version of Sicilian. Come over here and ask me some questions. All right. OK. I'm now an art dealer. I need to know more than I do. All right. What's a Norman Lindsay original sketch worth? Pen and ink, $1,200. Pencil, $900. Well, I'm off to workto try and poison someone. Hey, your old man'sdisappearing out of your life again, Chelsea. Mixing it with murdering Calabrians. I'm used to it. I love you, Papa Bear. Ciao, Uncle Vinnie. Ciao, Bella. See ya. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Colin had raised Chelsea alone since she was 18 months old. She never stopped worrying about him. Come on, bubba. Let's see what we've got here. Hmm. CHELSEA [VOICEOVER]: "Please, be careful. You're the only Papa Bear I've got. I love you. Chelsea." It's not acting. There is no script to follow. It's a matter of sticking to strategy, being utterly believable,and winging it. Being comfortable in ourart dealer and fiance skins, as comfortable with eachother as an engaged couple. Exactly. Hanging in, surviving. Am I flogging this stuff? Yes, but it's helping. And I don't know if this is strictly according to the manual, but I'm shitting myself. Can you sing. Not for nuts. Me neither, but I've found that it helps. [SINGING] We can put awaythe bad memories together. I don't know the words. [SINGING] Close thedoors to the past forever. Watching you touch, we're past this much, yeah. I'm alone with you tonight. I'm alone with you tonight. I'm alone with you tonight. Hey, what do you think? Uh-- You've never seen agirl in her undies before? Yes, sure. I just never figured youfor those kind of undies. Bang goes a girl's mystery. I'd go the cream and black thing. Low-cut blouse forRosario Torcaso's benefit. Now, we can't prepare beyond setting ourselves goals for each time. Understood. I'd have picked you for a boxers kind of bloke. Boxers are fine if you fancy an oversized slug flopping around your pants. Bang goes your mystery. So our first goal tonighthas to be to meet them. Meet them, and makeourselves interesting enough that want to get to know us. This is as low as I can get my top without my boobs falling out. If I take my bra off, I'mgonna look like a slapper. Absolutely fine. Spare batteries for the phone? Ready, lover? As I'll ever be, fiance. The key rings! Thank you so much. I'll treasure them. We did promise. We always keep our promises. Do you wanna meet my boys? I've told them everything about you. Do you remember my boys? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're just over here. OK. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:This was it, no turning back. How do you make small talk whenyour mind's completely blank? Boys, these are my friends. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Makesmall talk with fruit growers. [gunshots] Whose orchards are killing fields. Cole Goodwin and Jude Powell. This is Carlo Ricci, AntonioRusso, and his brother Rocco. Rosario Torcaso and his brother Dominic. Please, join us. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Maybe they weren't in the mood to kill anyone tonight. What will you drink? Sara maybe already knows. - Two G&Ts? - Spot on. Thank you, sir. This your first time in Griffith? No, this is, what, our second time? Yeah. I remember your first time. Yeah? I'm sorry. I don't recall. What a lovely place, Griffith. Yeah. It is so peaceful and relaxing. Thank you. We like it. It's sad there is a bad reputation here. Oh, I haven't come across that. Or me. But, anyway, what's a--what's a reputation worth? I mean, Melbourne's is for four seasons in one day. Thank you. Personally, I like variety. Thank you, Sara. You been to Melbourne, Rosario. ROSARIO: Many times. JUDE: What about Lygon Street? Do you like Lygon Street,the restaurants there? ROSARIO: Sure, we like Tiamo and-- You like, obviously, Italian food. Yeah. Grew up with Italians. Sort of an adopted son. Sunday lunch in the backyardwhen they come home from mass, open the fridge, caponata,you know, with the sardines. Homemade cassata. You grew up with Sicilians. Yeah, yeah. Good people. Yeah, not bad people, for fucking Sicilians. See, that's Calabrian humor. Yeah, well, they cook thebest Italian food I've ever had. Really? If you're hungry, if you would appreciate some nice Calabrian cucina, my family own a restaurant in the street. You're welcome to come. We'd love to. ANTONIO: We'll show you whatreal Italian food is, huh? [laughter] JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:So far, so good. Now came the difficult bit. We had to show them wehad something they wanted. But they had to discover it themselves. "Fichi ripieni alla Calabrese." I know that that is stuffedfigs, but "alla Calabrese"? "Alla Calabrese", yeah, sure, it's-- it's the sauce. It's not the sauce. It means it's cooked like in Calabria. I get it now. How you become art dealer? I grow grapes, citrus fruit. My family grew them. Your family was art dealers? No, no, no. I was maybe 18,backpacking around Europe. I stumbled upon the art galleries. They blew my mind. So you earn a commission? Sell a painting, get a percentage? Spinaci e patate arrosto. Grazie. Oh, dio! What is wrong with your phone? It's like it's going to burst into flames. She's warm. I told you it was too cheapto be any good, lover. She can't walk past a bargain. Am I in trouble again? Your bargain mobile phonewas about to burst into flames. Well, you've lost everyexpensive one I've bought you, so. It's like my wife. Cannot walk past bargain. [chuckling] So where were we? Commission. Put it this way, Antonio. If I had to rely on commission, I'd still be driving a Commodore. I have a fruitful relationshipwith some very clever clients. [chuckling] What sort of things do you learn from these clever clients? OK, so long as you're not the taxman. I learn things like, where doyou hide a mountain of cash so that the taxman might see it? It could be staring him right in the face, but he'd never recognize it. Yeah, it's a print. Mm-hmm. Cost maybe $50. You know that. Taxman doesn't. You spend 200 grand cash on a Tom Roberts, put it right there,taxman'll walk right past it. 200 grand cash, hidden in full view. If you picked the right painting, you can turn a profit on the resale, too. 40, 50% over two years sometimes. You know, you're a very goodbusinessman, Cole Goodwin. I honestly can't rememberthe last time I complained. Terrific night, Antonio. Thank you very much. It was a lovely night. [speaking italian] It wasnice meeting you both. Next time you come through,maybe we see each other again, eh? Sure thing. Hey, do you know, is there aUnited Bank branch in town? Yeah, yeah. Go two streets, turn left. Good man, Dominic. Thank you. Thanks, Dominic. Thank you, everyone. Night, all. Ciao. I can't believe I got through that. I can't believe Tiny didn't tell me the fucking phone cooks itself. Please tell me thisgets easier with practice. I wish I could. He's in between girlfriends, isn't he? The revolving door's infor repairs, I believe, yes. How long's it been since he's had a root? Your point being? Look, Jude's a sort and a half, but there's just no way in the world. He's a pro. It'd compromise the operation. Yeah, not to mentionconstitute a sacking offense on top of legal ramifications. Jude's untrained, therefore vulnerable. Which is exactly why he wouldn't. Antonio Russo's as seriouslybright as we figured. He's looking for new opportunities, which means he's receptive. You can't want more in a target. All up, we're on track. As long as those, um, undies don't derail us. If these are posing an operational difficulty, I can always switch to cottontails. I spoke to the accountant. Cole Goodwin was talking of athing called money laundering. Usually it makes your cashlook like it's legitimate, but with Cole's way, you can make 50% on top. [speaking italian] Because what is our cash earning us now? Our cash is safe now. [speaking italian] We're not fucking businessmen. What we do, we do well. [speaking italian] What do you think about Cole Goodwin? No way I'm gonna do it. Life's too short. Think business. What do you think about Cole Goodwin? Tell me. Never trust a fucking skip. Times change. I like his mind. I think we can use him. Sounded good last night,champer, Mrs. Champer. Early days, mate. Very early days. Hey, what's Tiny's story on that overheating? Well, best guess, it's battery-related. He's sourcing strongerones to test as we speak. Oh, and George Henderson from United bank called. Apparently staff at the Griffith branch did a recce on Cole Goodwin's accounts. You made an impression. How often does he fart in bed? COLIN: Fuck off! We've got a sweep running. - Favor. - Roger. You're a hard man to catch. I've had queries from aboveregarding our timelines. When can we expect to be looking at drug deals? When and if they happen. The last thing that we needis paranoid N'Drangheta. Sir, can you please talk to theother state section leaders, tell them to hold off any N'Drangheta busts until further notice? Done. JUDE GLEESON[VOICEOVER]: Colin wasn't making it up when he told Antonio he'd grown up with Italians. That's the secret of a good cover story. Make it as close to the truth as possible. Thanks for coming, Uncle Colin. Dad said you might not be able to make it. No, I wouldn't miss itfor the world, sweetheart. The most important dayin a Catholic kid's life, and you got here for her. You agnostic bastard. Ask him if he's makingit to my chef graduation. Are you gonna make it to the most important day in your only kid's life? I promised I'd try, OK? Try? Try? You slack parenting bastard. I'll do my best, sweetheart. [SINGING] Watching youtouch, We're past this much. I'm alone with you tonight. JUDE GLEESON[VOICEOVER]: In this job, you never, ever get over the nerves. It was the Calabrians' move. We could only play it by ear. Colin's job was to become Antonio's mate. Mine? To keep Rosario happy. You still got this fucking thing? Let me get you a new one. I know a guy. Thanks all the same, butI actually had it fixed. But it's shit. Well, it's sentimental shit, OK? Jude got it for me. Capito? Jude, I gotta ask you something. Ask away. Cole, this picture thing. I spoke to the accountant. He liked the idea. Mm, OK. Rocco's shy. Can't talk to a skirt. His balls turn blue like they're gonna burst. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Idon't know what was worse, Rosario's mouth, his BO, or his dress sense. Maybe you have time to finda nice painting for my wall. Sure. There's bound to be anart auction on somewhere. ANTONIO: The accountant said also maybe we can find other ways to work together, maybe make use of your bank account. Uh, park some money for you? For a commission, of course. Nah, mate. I wouldn't have a problem with that. You guys must be doingall right out of oranges. You bet. Plenty money in oranges, and lemons. And we have other irons in the fire. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Itwas the first hint he'd given, but a giant step in the right direction. It was a double infiltration. We were seducing him, and he was seducing us. 50 fucking grand for that? It's nice. I like it. So do I. You have good taste, Jude. This is Maria, my wife. Cole Goodwin, Jude Powell. Lovely to meet you. Oh, these are noisekids, Louisa, little Tony. Louisa! [laughter] I think Antonio shouldspend less time with Rosario and much more time with Cole. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Every so often, I'd catch myself thinking, theseare very warm, generous people. I like them. [music playing] SONG: Someone's alwayslooking over my shoulder. So scared. I'm frightened just to walk around the corner. Last night. Your eyes upon me everywhere. Looking over my shoulder. For a drug-dealing mafioso, Antonio Russo's pretty good company. SONG: Looking over my shoulder. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Cole, what do you reckonabout Italian religious art? I could take it or leave it. You can be honest. Maria likes this stuff. Hi, Jude. Hi, Cole. Maria. What do I like? Religious art. Hey, you leave my religious art alone. It's my faith. Coffee? - Yes, please. Please. Me, I have faith, but Ihate religious fucking art. If I see anotheragonized John the Baptist, I'll amputate his fucking head myself. [laughter] So Cole Goodwin, these other irons we have in the fire, small business we have on the side, plenty ofdope smoked in art business? [laughter] Mate, the art business wouldbe paralyzed without choof. That is interesting. We-- we was wondering. But that's nothing comparedto the music business. I've got some contacts in music,and they love their drugs. Believe me. That's even more interesting. So one that size. That's a Frankie size. That's a Tony size. Keep going, keep going. That's my size. Jude? Yes, darling? Jude, I'm studying for confirmation. Oh, Louisa, I'm not Catholic. You don't have to be to test me. OK, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Can't you ask me the disciples? Louisa, you know the disciples. What are the seven gifts? Hey, Cole! Cole! What does he bloody know? [chattering] What are you doing? What are you doing? You are not good! I know. Not very good. That's no good. Sorry. It's the Italianpriority that works for me. Family. Well you feel so much for family, Cole? Growing up, there wasn't much of one. Makes you swear you'd do it differently if you ever have one. One day, I hope you had the opportunity. Mmm. Your road has been hard, huh? Oh, you do your best. Don't ever make our road hard, Cole. Ever. Welcome to our family, Cole Goodwin. [shouting] What are you telling me? Something's happened. Leave it with me. I'll fix it. Madonna, madonna, madonna, madonna, [phone ringing] He's coming. We have a problem. Business. We have a snitch. We must go. Snitch? Someone we thought we could trust, huh? Not your problem. We find the snitch, they have problem. Stay, enjoy yourselves. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Wedidn't know what the hell had happened, but Colin grabbed the opportunity to prove that we'd been in the house, in case Antonio evertried to deny he'd met us. Yeah, thanks, Sandra. Yeah, good work, mate. Some Queensland admin dickhead decided an N'Drangheta bust in the Queensland boondocks wouldn't impact on our operation. How could they not thinkthat that would impact on us? Don't know whetheryou've noticed this, Jude, but the service is made up oftwo ranks that usually manage to achieve something, and above us about seven ranks of clowns who wouldn't know if their penises were on fire. Junk food and cat piss, perfect way to celebrate graduation. If Chef could see us now. Hey, who's missing? My dad. We share. He couldn't make it, but Iknow he's here in spirit. Cheers. Cheers. SONG: I've got no helmet. Baby, I've got not light. When your boyfriend comesback to town, I'll be gone. I didn't choose to be riding with you. [speaking italian] Carlo Ricci's been on the phone to Calabria. He wants someone called MassimoFalzetta on the first plane out here, ASAP. Massimo who the fuck? I don't know. Guido and the anti-Mafia unit in Rome will know. Thanks, Sandra. Carlo Ricci's importing a snitch hunter. Massimo Falzetta. According to Guido in theanti-Mafia unit in Rome, his talents are spoken of with awe. Ciao, Rocco. I think maybe we find someplacenice to talk business. What about back at our place? Jude does not want to be bothered by men discussing business. I don't mind men discussing business. Come on, Jude. Let's go, sweetheart. Jude, you'll get him back again, huh? Maybe a couple of hours. Come on, Jude. Let's go, honey. Bye. Papa Bear! Papa Bear. Hey, Papa Bear. Papa Bear! Hey, Papa Bear. Papa Bear, hey. Hah. What's that slag on? [speaking italian] All right, we ready? We can keep a fucking secret. So if you can, Jude don'thave to know nothing. Unless you make our road hard. Then we tell her. [chuckling] Time to get down to business, Cole. About time, Antonio. This ain't for you lot'sdelicate ears, Monica. Go lick each other all over, huh? I'll see you later. ANTONIO: OK, Cole. We have another iron in the fire. We're getting into cocaine. What do you reckon? You're diversifying? It's a good business practice. If you don't grow, you go backwards. Yeah, absolutely. What's the market like, you reckon, in the art business, music business? What, for cocaine? ROSARIO: Mmm. You've never seen so manydisintegrating nasal passages. [laughter] We're importing half a ton. But we already got stock. 195 grand a kilo, pure. What's that worth on the street, like a mill? Fair enough. I'll take a kilo of cocaine, thanks. [laughter] Nice finally doing business with you boys. Hey, what's the fucking hurry, Cole? Relax. We give all our newclients a fucking present. This is Rachel. We'd have wrapped her up for you, but she gets off at that sort of thing. [laughter] She'll take good care of you. How you doing? So what's your fancy? To be perfectly honest, I'd rather not. I'm gonna keep you up for hours. [moaning] For Christ's sake, let'skeep this off the record. A working girl pole-dancing onyour knob while you're on duty is some serious shit. Troops, progress? All good. I think he's on top of things. You're nice, Cole. How come you know Rosario and Antonio? They buy art from me. I'm an art dealer. Cool. I like art. Cool. Rosario must be reallyinterested in you and your art. He's a good guy, Rosario and Antonio. A couple of good guys. Good mates, in fact. Chelse, Chelse. How could you do that? Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. How was I to know? OK? And what were you doing there? Working. I got a job. Well, how am I to know? Because I left you a note. But it was still there two weekslater, so I just threw it away. I'm sorry. We didn't always have to communicate by notes. One day, OK? One day. Same old bullshit. One In the meantime, you don't know what those notes mean to me. OK? How was your night, anyway? Don't ask. Chelsea all right? Yeah. She's amazing. You should meet her. I almost did. As for the other matter, lucky we're not engaged. I would have cut your oversized slug off. Well, I did order a kilo of pure coke. As you do prior to a root in a brothel. Days in the office don't get much tougher. I reckon this is almostbetter than a real engagement even without the humping. Been there? Still am there. Is he in the job? Powerlifter. Professional? Just powerlifts. This is exactly what I mean. About what? What you need in a partner. Someone you can trust. And someone who trusts you. Yeah, well, you can't putbrains into monuments, can you? Ah, thanks, Big Bird. I owe you one. What now? A mate of mine with theNew South Wales task force reckons that word of our infiltration's all over Sydney and Brisbane. How can it be? There was a task forceadmin national conference a while back in Sydney. Afterwards, is a bit ofsocializing and professional dick-measuring, and all of a sudden our supposedly top secretoperation wasn't anymore. Great. How long till that reaches Griffith? Well, it better not, or we're dead. Clowns. I've never applied for $195,000 for a kilo of pure coke before. Well, think about it likeyou're applying for a new globe in your desk light. Times it by a million. Sandra. The response to ourapplication just came back. You might want to sit down. They've approved $50,000 maximum. What the fuck am Isupposed to say to Antonio? "Oh, yeah. Sorry, mate. You know, 50 grand's our limit. Me and Jude are just somepissant fringe players." The whole point of thisoperation is to do deals. You know, that's all theclowns are on my back about. Excuse me. I logged Carlo Ricci talking with Antonio. You are going to meet MassimoFalzetta later tonight. Carlo wants him to look you and Jude over. - Piacere, Massimo. - Piacere. Nice to meet you. This is my fiancee Jude. Piacere, Jude. Piacere. Massimo understands moreEnglish than he speaks. He's come out to help organizewith the cocaine importation. Fair enough. Excuse us, Carlo. Massimo. Yeah, we got, uh, businessto talk, don't we, Cole? Organize payment for a kilo ofcoke, deliveries, boring detail stuff. Sure. Jude, do you wanna organizesome drinks for everyone? Absolutely. I can offer everyone a lovely red wine, courtesy of some very generousfriends of ours in Griffith. For starters, you're probably not gonna wanna split a kilo of coke, are you? We can't. It comes in sealed packages of one kilo. You got problems, Cole? Only that this guy's umming and ahhing over three Norman Lindsay oils. Quarter of a mill's worth for 200 grand. He's still not coming around. That is disappointing. COLIN: It's pissing me off. ANTONIO: You said you had plenty contacts. Yeah. Fuck him off. Get the money somewhere else. Um, nice house. Thank you. Massimo fine with the red wine? Yeah, he is. [speaking italian] And he says that he wish he could live here. NEWSCASTER: The blastripped through the office on the top floor of the 12 story building. Contained in a parcel, the bomb blew up. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:On Tuesday March the 2nd, 1994, an obscenelydestructive phosphorous bomb delivered terror to Australia. The target was theNational Crime Authority's Adelaide task force office. The victim was Geoffrey Bowen, Colin's equivalent in South Australia. Who are IBM Promotions, Pete? Beats me. Be computer-related, yeah? I didn't order anything computer-related. Could be a bomb. Oh, yeah, right. There's no wires. NEWSCASTER: The dead man was Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen, a senior detective-- JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:South Australian Mafia identities were at the top of the suspect list. This is a wicked and evilthing that's been done. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Noone has ever been convicted. KEATING: Completely out ofthe character of this country. NEWSCASTER: The NCA has a wide-ranging role, investigating organized and white collar crime. Most recently, it's tackleddrugs and the Mafia. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:We beefed up our security. Every task force in the country did. But it didn't help me. I'm not leaving the operation, Roger. No way. We couldn't have got this far without Jude. Sorry. It's come from above. I don't care how highit came down from, Roger. What, did it come from the same clown that wouldn't authorize full-tote odds to buy that kilo of coke? It's been danger-- toodangerous for Jude to continue. Look, I understand yourfeelings, your loyalties. --opened his mouth and nearly got us killed! We cannot risk Jude's life! Now, this is not-- I stress-- it's not negotiable. It's understood foroperational legal reasons two operatives required forthe purposes of corroboration. I'll try to put another maleoperative in Jude's place. SONG: This endless ride has got me. I know. I've been holding on by a thread, falling towards the end. Hang on. SONG: But I have beenheld by a thousand hands. 26. One for each week of our engagement. SONG: And I know something is wrong. Thought you could do with some company. This stuff's like battery acid. I can hear it chewing throughthe glass as we speak. You started without me, you prick. They can get fucked, mate. Every clown that's ever fucked us over. Fuck all of them. Yeah, goodo. where's your corkie? See, the proverbial bar,champer, the bar that one sets for oneself, your bar is set permanently up there somewhere. I mean, a Mexican bloodyjumping bean on amphetamines couldn't clear it. Beats me why. And if that's not enough, you let the fucking clowns get to you. You take it personally. Right, you can't. OK, shit happens in life. Otherwise, the world's perfect, and it's not. Except Collingwood Football Club is. Geoffrey Bowen paidthe ultimate price, mate. And we can't get more than 50 grand. So walk away when Antonio tells me to piss off or walk away now? What's the diff? It's over. The only thing I'm gonna miss is his company. Yeah, you said he was good company. He bothered the shit out of me. That man has more balls and more brains than all the clowns put together. He kills people, champer. They can get you killed, Leigh. Getting on the piss aftera conference in Sydney. Colin. I told him not to call you. He tells me you're being a dickhead. You're out of it, babe. Better off. Hey, listen. You're not the only one with the investment. I put six of the craziest,most exciting months of my life into this. If you walk away now, I will personally put your oversized slug in a vise, and I'll stretch it untilit looks like that sausage in the photograph. [snorting] That makes two of us, fiance. So we've spent 18 monthsand goodness knows how many millions targeting N'Drangheta. Now, for an extra couple of$100,000 we can clean them up. Now, I'm no accountant, butthat sounds like a mighty good investment to me. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:The commissioner did his sums and saw the sense. Roger, ever cautious,insisted Colin wear a wire as well as carry themobile phone transmitter. Cole, I was sorry to hearJude's mother is not well. Thanks, mate. I spoke to her this morning in Sydney. Things aren't looking good. She said to say hello. Give her out best regards, huh? Yeah, will do. Thanks, mate. What's this? [speaking italian] [laughter] Is that really what I think it is? ROSARIO: It's your kilo of purefucking cocaine, you prick. Let me tow this baby somewhere safe. I'm gonna be back later with the cash at 7:30. You do trust me to pay later? We know where you fucking live, skip. [laughter] [speaking italian] JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Then, at 7:30, on the dot. That should cover the cost of dessert. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Followed two weeks later by 10 kilos of skunk weed. With funding freed up, Colin became a regular at his localdrug dealer corner store. 18 months of scheming, sweating, and tradecraft all coming to fruition. And it got even better. Cole, this business we've been doing, it's, what do you say, chicken shit compared to what we have in mind next. Half a ton of marijuanaheads grown in New Guinea. $6 million worth. It comes from New Guinea on aboat to this Queensland place. Horn. Horn Island. We load it onto a plane, fly it to Griffith. We gift you 1/6 share, $1 million worth. The cost to you, zero. Nothing. Just find us an aeroplane and a pilot. For some reason, we humble fruit growers have trouble hiring aeroplanes. Done. Jeez, when it fuckingrains round here, it pours. And this is the icing on the proverbial. This cuts N'Drangheta's head off and buries it. Is this doable? Yeah, it's gotta be. I mean, sure. I run into coppers with covert experience and a pilot's license everyday. Yeah? Well, let's find us one. I'd shit myself if I hadto front the N'Drangheta. And so would he. I'm down to this guy. I wish I could say hefilled me with more hope. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Senior Sergeant Jim Zignatowski was a loyal Victoria police officer who enjoyed his posting in the peace and quiet of the Coroners Court. So where's Horn Island? Torres Strait, just off Cape York Peninsula. Then fly back to an airfieldjust outside Griffith, New South Wales, with cargo. Half a ton of marijuana heads. And at least onepassenger, Colin McLaren. Undercover as Cole Goodwin. But in all likelihood, there'll be two passengers, Colin and Rosario Torcaso, a member of the N'Drangheta. The n'dra-what? Calabrian Mafia. Oh. No, it all looks feasible. Half ton of cargo, a couple of passengers. Have to rip the interior out to fit it all in. Looking at something fairly sizable, EG, your Navajo Chieftain. All right, can you fly one? In my sleep, Colin. You gotta remember "Cole". All right? You gotta remember "Cole". Don't worry. We're cooking, Ziggy. Cole. Cole. Yeah, Cole. Civil aviation bods will go mental. Why's that? I've got a license to fly a Navajo Chieftain. Bit like having a-- well,a car license and you wanna drive, EG, a bus. I could get a license, though. Only take a couple of months, but Colin-- Cole. Sorry I'm early. Antonio up yet? Just woken up. Oh. Bad timing. Can you tell him that theplane's not a problem, but there's a bit of a glitch with the pilot. We're looking at maybe 8 week's. So you've got a pilot. Yeah, of course I've got a pilot. We've gotta meet him, approve him. That's the glitch. He's in demand, because he's the best. The boat has to land here, at the jetty. There's nowhere else. This is all mangroves. You've got about 10 to 12 meters of grassy area here right at the end of the strip. Now, the plane will park here for quickest, most efficient loading. So I'm thinking that we put the soggies in here, in the mangroves,which will be here. That way they can cover both directions, the plane and the jetty. Once that plane is loaded,then we move in, OK? You, you're gonna be inGriffith with the calvary, awaiting my call to takedown the N'Drangheta brass. Colin, why the SOGs? COLIN: Because they're the pros. But they're Melbourne-based. The SERTs are Queensland-based. The SOGs are the pros, Roger. One more wish and we get our pilot. That's good news. I told Rosario 100 time, you don't let us down. [phone ringing] I'll tell you something, too. You lucky small businessman. Our big business, all Iget, a big headache, huh? This stuff Italian? Hmm. Italian Renaissance. I see no John theBaptist asking for his head to be fucking amputated, huh? Grazie a dio, eh? Hmm. The Italian Renaissance artistsled the way into secular art, non-religious stuff. You're really into art, huh? Art washes away from thesoul the dust of everyday life. Yeah. That's nice. I like that. Yeah, I wish I'd thoughtof it before Picasso did. Cole, I have a confession. Massimo Falzetta come here to find the snitch. Carlo's idea. Carlo never trusted you and Jude. Even when I vouch for you. Even when I stake my own lifethat you are trustworthy, he no believe me. Old men, huh? Old men, huh? Hey, maybe we bring Mariahere, you and me and Jude? Hmm. Wash from the souls the dust of everyday life. Ziggy. Oh, g'day, mate. How are you? When did you last shower, mate? Oh, about a week or so ago. Thought I might as well look the part. Sleeping on the couch at home and everything. So I meet you and RosarioTorcaso, Weipa Airport about 3 AM, day after tomorrow. Just so you know, Ziggy,this is out of satellite range after Weipa. After that, we're on our own. It might be a good idea if you just kept a very low profile, OK? Just keep the pressure off yourself. Mate, I'm away ahead of you. Mr. Invisible is me. Just fucking one week-- That's enough. Rosario, you ready to go? I'm sorry, Cole. Rosario got too many thingsto organize in Griffith. I don't know what the fuck's going on. And there isn't a weapon on that plane. Look, I'll see if I can organize to get you one at Brissy or Cairns Airport. Thanks. I couldn't shake him in Brissy. No, he even went for a piss with me. SANDRA [ON PHONE]: So Brissy said. I'm sorry, babe.That was our last chance. Listen, one more quick thing. You have the SERTs at Horn Island. Fuck! SANDRA [ON PHONE]: Roger's doing. I'm sorry. More economical than flying up the SOGs. I can't talk to againafter Weipa, so good luck. Thanks, Sandra. Morning, Cole. Hey. Rosario. Not Rosario. This is Massimo Falzetta. How good's your memory? Too bloody good. 10 minutes till the boat arrives, Massimo. Hey, Rosario. Hey, don't worry. Cole is on top of it. He'll call us. OK? Massimo, I can hear the boat. Well, they're on time. Here they come, Massimo. [speaking italian] Police, freeze! Freeze, don't move! Don't move! Get down on the ground! Don't move. Get down! [chorus singing] Ah, the man himself. Congratulations. A SERT broke cover when he got pissed on. We missed the boat and the drugs. No matter. We got them on conspiracy to import. That and everything else. 13 N'Drangheta in custody,including all the top brass. It was a fuck-up, Roger. A monumental fuck-up. We cut the N'Drangheta's head off. Mission accomplished. I'll do my best to ensure that nothing comes of the intercoursewith a prostitute business. I'll do my best, but never can tell. No more notes. Ever. I promise. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: TheCalabrians' committal hearing was the first time they had seteyes on us since their arrest. We call Detective SergeantColin McLaren to the stand. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Or,as they were probably entitled to describe it, their betrayal. It's a two way street, betrayal. You can feel betrayed, andyou can know in your heart that you have betrayed. And you wonder how you'regoing to live with it. MAN: Please read the statement. I solemnly and sincerelydeclare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth,and nothing but the truth. MAN: Be seated. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Colin spent six days in the witness box. Day three was the killer. MAN: Where did this meeting take place? At the Green Gardens Hotel. And was it on the secondor the third meeting that you allege my clientdiscussed the importation? JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Our case was overwhelming. All the defense could do was try to undermine Colin's credibility as a witnessby catching him out on details. One of which you claim in Juneof last year, the 9th of June. The 11th of June, in Mr. Russo's suite. Tell the court what transpired. I arrived early. I knocked on the door, andMr. Torcaso told me that Mr. Russo was still in bed. And? And I went to the bedroom door, I knocked and I opened the door. MAN: And? And Mr. Russo was in bed with Kim. Kim is a waitress from Griffith. She accompanied Mr. Russo onseveral trips to Melbourne. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:In the N'Drangheta world, honor isn't just important. It's all that matters. What goes on in private is private, even if everyone knows it goes on. There's no logic. That's just the way it is. But when private becomes public-- How are you? Shithouse. Maria's face. Hazard of the trade. How are you? They're gonna be committed. They'll be convicted. We should be celebrating. Yup. You know, there is one bit of tradecraft that I never got around to mentioning. Yeah? What's that? The very best never hopefor an apartment is a mate. And we done good, mate. See you when I'm looking at you, Roger. Sorry? I just quit. Well, what on earth for? It's a huge result. Don'tyou understand the future that's set up for you? Yeah. Reckon you'll get a promotion out of it? I'm quietly confident. Yeah. See you when I'm looking at you. Now, I've come to the realization that the only way to avoidgooses pooing down on you is to work for yourself. There's no one there to screw it up for you. And there's no one there to bask in the glory when you have a win. Sounds logical to me. Hmm. So that's why we're going into business. At first, I was thinking of, you know, pensione. Like a-- a B&B? Yeah. But then I thought, hang on, Chelse is a chef. why not make it a ristorante? And then I thought, bugger it. Go the whole hog, you weak sod. So it's gonna be called Villa Gusto. And it's gonna be an Italian hotel and restaurant, with me hosting,pulling corks, and you cooking. what do you reckon? [laughter] Ours. JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]:Antonio Russo served eight years of his 13 year sentence. In those days, a quick guiltyplea earned a reduction. He'd been advised not to return to Griffith. Antonio! JUDE GLEESON [VOICEOVER]: Butthat wasn't Antonio's way. [gunshot] Some said Antonio was punishedfor getting conned by a skip. Most reckon he'd have been forgiven that mistake, if he hadn'tpublicly dishonored his wife. [phone ringing] Colin McLaren. You fucking user. You fucking, fucking user. Who's this? Just somebody else you fucking used. What do you do? Sara. I hope Antonio Russo hauntsyou for the rest of your days. [sighs] [theme music] SONG: It's a jungle out there.
