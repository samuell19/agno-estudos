A film by Carlos Reichenbach You’re right, perhaps it’s best for you not to know. I have failed. Fausto, let me sleep! Fausto! Stop that! For the love of God, it's hurting! Stop! Are you crazy? It’s hurting. It’s hurting! Stop! Stop, I don’t want this. Stop, it’s hurting! Stop, it’s hurting! What did you do to my nightdress? Why did you do this? There’s no point in going crazy Fausto. I want a divorce! As soon as possible. Or else I’ll send you to an asylum Goodbye cow! Motel Sol Bitch Zé? Where’s my car Zé? Give it a rest partner! - Where is my car Isidoro? - What car? - My car! Fuck! - What’s up huh? They stole my car! They took it, remember? It’s been a week. You're broke, remember? You lost everything. Look do you want me to call the apartment manager? There’s the question of you not paying your apartment for 3 months. And you were the only person who didn’t leave a Christmas present. Wait! Wait! Calm down, the apartment is still yours! - You only need to sell it. - Open the drawer! For what? - Give me the receipts. - You’re telling me you’re going to pay? - With what? - Open that shit! - Watch how you speak to me! - Open it. Fuck! Oh my God, take your hand out of there. You can’t do that! Give that back! Are you insane? Return the gun! Play nice there, take a nap. What will you do? Nothing. It’s only for protection. I want to walk around a bit at night. You know how it is. I’m going to get in trouble. Easy there, early tomorrow I’ll return it. Be sensible! Take it easy Isidoro. You! Don’t go far! The spirit doesn’t look forwards nor backwards, only in the present. May I offer you something? Look. - What’s this? - A trip. How much? It’s free. - For now, it’s free. - Get out of my face. Lenora! Watch your head! I said lean up against the car! - Calm down my friend. - Be quiet! Leave it to me. Go help Jorge, go. - If you're armed you’ll be sorry. - Fausto! Fausto! That guy is my friend. - He’s a good guy. - Shut up! - What’s happening here? - Tell them, tell them. - Who are you? A cop? - He's in the business. Hot stuff. He’s the guy who manufactures those cigarettes- the Eden, the Aztec, Monte Hellman. Look, that Aztec is one hell of a sleaze. Sir, do you know this man? I take responsibility for him. And that other one there? Besides the fact that neither had an ID, both were loitering over there on Republica. And we apprehended a cold one tied to this guy right here. - Hey, I’m clean. I had nothing on me. - Can you free this guy? He works for me. Alright, alright, but the other one comes with us. Wait a second there, I also work at the factory. You work jack! Liar! Prick! Vagner, you’re gonna let me get fucked? You bastard! - He’s the one that falsified that ID. - Let’s go. - Son of a bitch! - I never expected this from you! Crook. Almost got caught up in this shit! What am I doing in here? My God! Get your hands off of me! Leave me alone man. I am perplexed. You really are a shameless motherfucker, huh? Thadeu is a real sucker. All suckers need to dance. Oh yeah? And if I knew my factory was a sucker? I'd be fucked! You superseded those people. I ditched my card and they didn’t even notice. Well? What’s with the face? You're probably doing alright. You must have gotten out of that bust with some good money. Well maybe not, by the way you go about. Your brother-in-law must have pocketed a fortune. Huh? Don’t tell me you didn’t think of that. My childhood friend and a moron the very same. Let’s not forget how big of a man your father was. He left it all behind on a silver platter remember? If you had put me in there, sure, I would have stolen a ton. But you would have been fine. I don’t understand why my father liked you. The old man had a vision. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You swindler. You are now one of us. In a universe of failures. Of renegades. The morgue of the hallucinated. The exile of the lucid. Post-modern society is at fault for your failure. Go Fausto. Take advantage of this civil rebellion... and dive headfirst in the bounds of society! You have to let your creative vision flow. It was from shit that Pompeii was born. From these destitute conditions, there were born Gods! ...from like a year ago, in '83 I already toyed with Beat poetry because for me, poetry is revolution, poetry is life, so, my identity... with this more rebellious vein of modern poetry. - Me? - came ever since I realized I was a poet. Looks like I found me a broad. So, the Beat generation came around 20 years ago. But its surrealism is 60 years old. - Anarchism? 150 years. - Hi. - Hi, do you have a cig? Topical socialism? 200 years ago. So what? - Everything okay? - While we have a fallible society, - there has to be rebellion, - Thanks love. - there has to be questioning. - Do you have a light? - Oh! For you I have anything. - If you look at surrealism, - it has much to do with my poetry. - Look, the cigarette you were looking for. Oh, thank you. That's great! - So, as I was saying, - Here, your cigarettes. if you get one of my poems, you’ll see that the majesty of surrealism is present. For example, my poem, "Visitors Four" "Our space, is the space of the terrible The Pantanal, barricaded by warm winds "Traversing piccolos of seaweed "The definitive night and the frozen scream "We gradually penetrate "In this garden of negations where words ask for more space ”There is not much life left on the surface of this planet "Perhaps somewhere it can be heard the wind blow between the trees ”Distant voices filling a valley ”Dog barks on the far side of the mountain "We transform ourselves into plants, in roots, in unrefined ore "So it is possible for us to converse "We shall survive” You were just gonna ditch me there? - I’m going. - Relax, then so will we. I want to be alone. Alright, so this will stay with me then. You dropped the ball bigtime. And it’ll good for you to stop coming up with stupid ideas. You'll be our guest. - Let’s go, we’re watching a conference. - Conference? At this time of night? Why not? The sailors did everything before following Jonah's advice. They ended up throwing Jonah overboard. Immediately, the sea- subsides. Then, Jonah was swallowed by a large fish and he stayed in its stomach for three days and three nights. Jonah then asked God to free him of that prison. God made the fish- vomit Jonah on dry land. And then, Jonah went up and away. In that manner, saving the people of the town. So, we conclude: entering the boat a stowaway of the ship to sleep in the middle of the ocean. Now, for the most important part He’s in the vent of the fish. He’s protected and isolated, far away from any human communication deep inside the maternal uterus. We see that this protective element is as potent as the element of fear that he no longer can take it! And Jonah was obligated to beg God to free him of the place he was trapped in. So here we can see the characteristic mechanism of... Neu-ro-sis He adopts a defense against a danger, but it later surpasses its initial defensive function, transforming into a... neurological symptom. Because the person wants to be freed. So now, we have a, straight line. - I had a dream. - Tell me son! I wanted to reach the ocean, but each time, the ocean retreated. So I heard news of a big tsunami on the radio Yes! Perfect! Look! Mar Remoto! It’s all there! Let’s wrap this up! I have to go home! Well since we went a bit over, we’ll quickly go over concluding thoughts. Please, a word from our beloved professor of logic. From my point of view, of logic, Oh devil. My troupe disperses, Everyone will go to hell. Alone at my post, I will fight them. Out! It’s the ease of evil! A limited experience. Fausto wanted a sovereign act, bled his life through evil blood, and his dignity hardened. The bad saint, that lives in the mind and the emotions. The angel of the apocalypse, saintly and sacred, dangerous, violent, profane walks towards destruction. You’ve passed all the obstacles, transgressed, destroyed. Evil becoming a duty, or even into good! Shoot me! Shoot me! Betray the friend! Death is only a drug! Shut up! Okay, okay, okay. Look over there, beautiful women huh? Stay there, I’m going to the stage. Do something about your friend over there. Look here! Look here! Total promiscuity! Throw out your libido! Forget about your morals! Whores and sinners... ...defacing the empire of emotions! To fuck, to fuck... ...to laugh a little. Enough of that. We're here enjoying. Let’s not lose these broads. They’re into me. You’ve already let yourself go! Don’t exaggerate! Look, come with me. What you really need now, is a fine orgasm! Of course! Where are the other girls? - They left. - You going? - Yes. Alright. You’ll do just fine then. Wait a second! Let me put something on! Come back anytime. Happy Hell Nightclub Well, it was good to see you my friend! - Whats the deal? - I want to go with him. - But he’s not interested! - Suit yourself then. - Can’t you see he’s not interested? - Fine! Okay, okay. You both go. Make a sandwich! Fausto! Come here! Look here! The halls of cancer! The altars of syphilis! Perpetual molestation! Smell what’s rotting! You need to infect the lungs. Intoxicate the soul! Got good herb in there? Brothel sweet brothel! The sperm temple! To fear even the most obscene pansexuals! You! You scared of breaking a sweat? Yikes. Nope, I don’t think she’s playing around. Well if you’re scared go and leave then. - I’m staying. - Me? Scared? I’m smooth man. Ladies love me. So? You coming in or not? Well, I think I’ll be going now. Early tomorrow I’m having breakfast at my sister's and I need to— Hey. How are you? Hey now! Wait a minute! Let go of me! I’m a stickler for one thing only honey… and that’s hygiene. It’s gonna sting a little okay? - Where is that at? - What? This place. No idea. That was there when I got here. There. You know, I went by your face. Guys got a sackful of cash, but he’s armed. There there babe… What’s up hot stuff? And me? Surprise! Holy fuck! You there! Sit and shut up! Oh my heavenly father... Sir… Just let me go. Please? I… I was trying to recover... They forced me to do this sir... I’m nothing but a victim of society! I grew up poor… When I was seven, I stole a watermelon at the market. I spent 10 years in juvie! - You understand? - Get out! Thanks. You sir are a generous man! Get out through the window! Come again? Quickly! Fuck! But we’re too high up. Outta here. - You’re being cruel. - Get up there… go. I just want to see your little hands dangle. Let’s go. Get your butt out the window. Faster! Calm down! Calm yourself! I can’t do it. But you will… You will! Fuck me. - Oh my God... - That’s right... Sir... look at me… let me out of here sir... Please! I can’t for much longer! Help! It's curious the way devils encounter nature! It’s really him! Fausto. Hello. Fausto? Remember me? You still don't? I was the one who looked into your case. Well, I spoke a lot more to your lawyer, Gildo. My word… It was a damn shame things ended like they did. But... there is something... You were right. Very right. To be honest, I found Gildo’s defense very odd. With all those German machines... that should have cleared you. You know, I’ve smoked your brand before. One of those ones with the cork tips. Brand name was... Opera! Good tobacco. From the time of my father. He understood the business. Don’t worry about it. I know it’s no consolation. I have seen many good men cheated. It doesn’t matter. I didn’t like any of that shit. Well I didn’t mean to upset you. I saw you sleeping there and of course I felt bad. I hope you beat this. See this through. Goodbye! - Give me a pack of Edens. - Eden? Don’t you remember that cigarette? It doesn’t exist anymore. Their factory closed. How? So there’s none left? - You’re from back west right? - I’m from Jales, why? Well, you can only find these brands over there. - Take another one. - No. I’ll look somewhere else. Today at Midnight - A pack of Edens. - Eden? None left. What do you want with me? I know where you can find Eden. Yeah? - Only it's a little far. - Are you a seller? I was the owner. Phoenix Cigarette Factory What are you going to do? Fill you up with cigs. - You with the police? - How come? That factory is closed. There’s no entry. It’s okay... I’m with the owner. But he can’t go in either! Mister Fausto, Here. Your persistence rewarded you. Mister Fausto, you could go to jail. That’s my problem! You took a risk taking down that notice. It's okay! Look, if there’s a problem, I’ll just say I saw someone trying to get in. What’s with all the worry? You look sick. Let’s go home? I’m all alone. Everyone went to the beach. Alright? It’s worse to be out here. These people like to be nosy. Could even call the cops. Come. Why did you disappear, you bastard! Mércia... Sweet Mércia You don’t like me anymore. I’m tired. You need a bath. You want something to eat? Want me to make you a coffee? That’s new. You like it? My cousin gave it to me. - I think it’s beautiful. - Where is it of? Not sure. Maybe on the southern coast. Tell me where it is! What’s with you? You’re hurting me! If you want I... I can find out, she’s visiting me in 3 months... Have a seat. I'll make us some coffee. No point in beating yourself up Fausto. That’s the way things are. We go killing ourselves... for nothing. There’s people worse off than you. Some people there still haven’t been able to find work again. They really liked you over there. Good thing you made things right with them. If anyone deserves anything, it's those workers. With your father it was different... Doris too. Times like those, women have to push through it... support their husbands... Things weren’t easy huh? They were used to that good life. But I never told you... My father told me she used to go out with an associate of Mister Gildo. That man... Zé Carlos. Are you even listening? Less sugar, right? You’re no different than any other man. You always saw me as replaceable. You still go out with that Kiala girl? Iron this would you? Won’t you kiss me? So it’s really over huh? Nothing's over... yet. So, what are you doing with this? Your shirt stank, but I still ironed it. I took care of your socks too. The only hard part was your coat, I still haven’t learned to do it where the buttons are. You’re a whole new man with ironed clothes. Why don’t we spend the day together? I’ve always wanted to spend a whole day with you. We could go to the botanical garden. - What are you doing with that? - Blow my brains out. There’s nothing I can do to help you? - You recognize where this is? - Malibu. Malibu? No... Maracaibo. Or maybe it's Nassau? I think it’s Sumatra. Oh I know! Costa Brava. No no... Zamboanga! Or Honululu! I know where that place is. Miracele. South of the sun. The promontory of the daydreamers! The vortex of the utopians! The forefront of furor! The phoenix of the earth! Paradise's hangover! Pandora's pussy! The saga of Anatahan! The templars’ monastery! The aleph of anarchy! The pool of Thanatos! The refuge for the nihilists! The visionary’s Eden! Law Offices of Gildo Lobo and Barata Hi. Mr. Gildo is in a meeting with Mr. Zé Carlos. Where? You can wait over there Mr. Fausto. I asked where! - Where? - In Barata’s office. They do not wish to be interrupted! Oh really? Close the fucking door! Look! It's him. - That’s not him... - Well, he has his face! Maybe a little. Even his wife won’t tell the difference. What’s the meaning of all this huh? Huh? How did you get in? Just another trick huh? Minor conspiracies. Political strategies. Shut up! Don’t worry Gildo, he’s one of us. Isn’t that Nazzaro? The deputy? That’s the thing, it isn’t him. Just so happens that Nazzaro doesn’t have an alibi. You know where he was at that exact moment? In a motel with a 12 year old girl! In the Motel Sol! What motel is that? Where you mess around with my wife! Well! I have to prepare for my clients. Sit down! Whats with you getting all aggressive with people? My sister has already started the divorce process... on the grounds of mental abuse! Your sister is something of a skank! Fausto! You’re being unfair! You’re not acting very mature! But of course! Divorce is the best option for everyone here! Also, I’ve been thinking... you pay child support for your daughter... Yeah! And if you want, you can even have her! I’ll convince Doris. No, I think you’ll make a good mentor. You’re also a rich man. You'll be able to give them a good life. - And Doris is high maintenance. - Yeah? You’re always trying to shift your responsibilities onto other people! - It’s exactly that! - Let's cut the chit chat. I've come to acquire a loan. What loan? We’re submerged in debt! "We?" No. "I" am! Come in! I brought you all coffee. Who asked? Didn’t I ask to not be interrupted? No… well I knew… I just thought— You want coffee? Me? No. So take it away. Oh! Mr. Howard phoned twice. He says he awaits a response today. Listen. This Howard... isn’t he from Trevor Tobake Incorporated? Anyway, I’ll show you the reel I found at my mother-in-law's. - I asked you a question Gildo! - Relax... it isn’t anything you’re thinking of. They’re only interested in the German machines. Of course! They were after that the entire time! And I told them a thousand times... I’d rather stumble into shit, than to spread my legs for those sons of bitches! Fausto, you’re an old soul. A provincial type. You were never able to address your contradictions. Always too embarrassed to act as the businessman. The apologetic boss. In times of crisis, you hid behind books of poetry. - Weak! Weak! - Pay attention! Turn that shit back on! Look Gildo! The 40's! My family convention. Look there, my mother-in-law. It’s not the time of your father's anymore. You thought it was only about taking over the company as an heir. Not your father though, he had a vision! You remind me of Phaethon... Apollo’s son who drove his chariot in vain. Yeah. But at least he had the audacity to try! Poetry... poetry! None of that helped your credit shortage. Doesn’t matter... You had none of that physique du rôle! Yeah, I agree. Enough playing around. This time, I brought my new lawyer! Mr. Smith! Gildo! For the love of God, the man is insane! Pathetic! Phaethon's route goes bust. Gildo... don’t mess with him. He's bananas. I am. I'm about as crazy as you get. Itching to shove an olive in each of your navels! Another one of your irrational outbursts! What do you want from us? I have nothing to do with this! Gildo was the one who fucked you over! And with the Doris thing... She’s the one who played me! Some bullshit! Empty out your pockets on the table now! - Me too? - Why not? You scum... I had so many plans for us. A new factory! Yes. You as the head, and me up in the warehouse. At least leave me the documents… my permit! - What permit? - Look, I think that’s everything. - Not a lot huh? - Well yes! You know how it is. With all the theft, you can’t carry much money. The rest! Let’s go! - Wait, wait, I think I have a bit more. - Mr. Gildo? The people from the chamber of commerce just arrived. What do I do? Tell them to wait! - The rest! - One minute! Faster now! Go! Go! What now? Are you going to kill us? Barata... you just gave me a great idea! I mean, Didn’t I say? It’s them! What’s happening? Mr. Gildo! Mr. Zé Carlos! But what’s all this about? Is this a joke? - We were robbed! - What happened? What did you do to them? Liberty Hey You old fool! It’s been a while! Aryo! This guy studied with me in college! - Business is good huh? - So-so. I’m on the run partner. I need your help. Money? Don’t bother. I’m just making ends meet out here. See what crazy woman did to you? Just like I say, alone, only what you had in the beginning survives. That old man Barre was right. Remember? The artisan, the craftsman, the small industry will disappear, because there they produce indefinitely, work from commissions, and don’t anticipate consistent orders. It’s this stability that implicates... a lesser degree of invention and innovation. The modern economy... is essentially a group economy. What matters is that competitive spirit, inquisitiveness and rationale. You cannot produce by yourself... in a society that revolves around machines. Mass manufacturing will replace our individual anarchy! Barre is a reactionary! But he predicted everything! Including this mending of capitalism. State media smear campaigns and the inevitable, sneaky cartel invasions ended up fucking over a lot of people including yourself! Listen, I only came here to buy a car. If only you had a little more! I want the cheapest one you’ve got. And the ring, how many carats is that? - No idea. - Forget it. What is this? I’ll let you have the car! You can even keep the money! This might be worth something. An authentic Smith? I got just the thing for you! A hell of a car! A convertible! Fit for an executive! - Bye! - Bye! To vagrants, Everyday, there are police raids here... whoever is caught will pay. Honduras... Honduras. What brings you here? A trip... Miracele. I’ve dreamt of this place. I’m in the water, I swim, but I'm going nowhere… and when I get there, it’s not what I’m after. There’s a little girl... a woman who fled from her dreams. The nightmare is a sign from hell. All of the traps from labyrinth. Guide me. You ask me of utopia. Utopia is the alchemy capable to turn gold to dust. It’s the savage beast that mimics a gazelle. It’s finding beauty in the remnants of a lost country. The sparkle in the eyes of a chinaman high off opium The universal substance that imagined the poet. Utopia is the panacea of the symbol as if it were a cross, the sickle and hammer, the greek characters, the swastika, the six-pointed star. Intelligence appears to only concerns itself with two biological phenomenon. Firstly, everything that distinguishes a living body... from a dead one. Vigilance, sleep, disease, and death. Secondly, the nature of the humanly forms that manifest in dreams and in visions. From there you conclude, that in every man there is a vital spirit... and a ghost. Only him who travels within knows how to distinguish truth from its shadow. Stay here. The universe is here. All your travels are here. But not Miracele. Wake up! Wake up man! - Wake up! - What’s happened? I want to see some documentation. Let’s go! In my jacket. Put that on. - But aren’t you that Nicaragua guy? - What Nicaragua guy? Where’d you steal this from? Give it back! It’s mine! - Are you’re really a businessman? - I am. Where’s that dirty communist? - What communist? - Nicaragua! It’s Honduras. - Nicaragua! - Honduras! It’s all the same. Fuck! Look here boss, I found Guatemala! - Efigenio Oliveira Honduras! - I don't care! Put him in the car! What’s the accusation against him? Assault. Attempting to fraud someone. Article 206 of the penal code. The suspect brought over teenagers and practiced voodoo at night during full moons. - Black magic. - The neighborhood complained. Careful with that other one there! Cutting drugs, trafficking, and the worst: it’s been 3 months since he’s payed support to his wife. Listen... so I can’t do anything for him? There’s no point in trying! Don’t worry, he’s well regarded by the media nothing’s gonna happen. Let’s go Leo! Fausto! Fausto! Look who's here Fausto! Man... Do me a solid man! Show them that little card you have! Wait Fausto... where are you going? You’re not gonna leave me here right? That son of a bitch! He stole that car! He doesn’t own a car! Leo, let’s get going. Let me go at him alone okay? Want your fortune read sir? Bad luck comes to those who ignore gypsies. - What do you want? - Your hand. Put here all the money that your heart desires. - I already knew... - That comes from within. - Here. - It’s from the heart? Hurry up. You come from a good life. Lots of women... now… your timeline… I see a very long line... What? What’s wrong? What's wrong? You my friend like to hear messages. So, remember this. We each learn from each other’s nuances... so we keep walking. It's just not possible, but it is. How’s the lunch like here? - It’s fantastic! - What do you got? Theres these pork chops... Give me a pack of cigarettes. - What brand? - Whichever one. You know this one? God. You still have more from this brand? - You want another one? - No it’s alright. Anything else my friend? We won’t wait for another plague! We have had our fill! Hey! Hey! You there! - Where are you headed? - No idea. Following the highway. Give me a ride? But I have no idea where I’m going. Don’t worry, I’m going just up ahead. Alright, hop in. - Want one? - No. Why did you do that? - Don’t you know who I am? - Who cares! Who told you to turn off the radio? We interrupt our broadcast with breaking news. What’s with you? Turn that shit back on! Whatever is going on right now does not matter. Is that so? So what is it that matters more you hellish woman! Follow the road. What’s with all these people I meet? Smoking doesn’t bother you, right? No. I accept. Would you give me a lift? You, go to the back! I could have gone in the back. You didn’t have to mistreat your mom. She’s not my mother. Where’d you get this ride? You’re a handsome one aren’t you? Yeah man. This is sweet. - Can we play something? - Auntie here doesn’t like it. Any extra grub back there? Careful, it could be cursed. Want some, prettyboy? No. Can’t you get rid of the old lady? Really I should get rid of you both. I’ll light it. This is too strong for me. You smoke another brand? I’ve never seen this cigarette brand before. What brand is it? Eden. I never heard of this brand. - Where did you find that? - They gave it to me. You ladies will have to excuse me, but I’m going to stop. Auntie you can go stretch your legs because I might take a while. Ok. Isn’t she cute? Hey, help me out. Hey you stud, Aren’t you coming in? No. Hey man! You’re not gay right? Well aren't you the serious type handsome? Where were you coming from? A funeral? Couldn’t you tell I’m hot to fuck you? Don’t you find me sexy? Go dress yourself. What do you want me to do? I want you to stop annoying me! Auntie, go for a walk. I’m gonna take longer. Okay. Where’s he going? Wow. Who are you? Without even noticing you... summoned me with so much force... so much persistence... and now you can’t even recall who I am? What do you want? I only wish to serve you. To take you where you want to go. Until then, I won’t be able to relax in good conscience. But when we meet again on the other side, It will be you who serves me. Humble and serene. No. I’d rather be lost! Without me, this road will take you nowhere. I don’t care. I don’t even have a soul to offer you! It’s your choice. Take your cigarettes. In the end, that was the reason why you came to this Earth. It’s strange. But I feel like the destination isn’t the most important. It’s the travel. Dive within myself. Find in every experience, my own importance. Man progresses because he is shameless. He perfected himself in disgrace and for disgrace. I break myself into many little pieces. It’s then possible that the other side comes next. That is why I don’t question anything. - What’s wrong? - I had a bad dream.
