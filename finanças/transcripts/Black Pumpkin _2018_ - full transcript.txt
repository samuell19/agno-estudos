They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer. What? Well it's eight o'clock and it's still light. Lot of good the extra daylight does us. Now we still got a three hour drive back, we're not gonna be home until after midnight. You wouldn't do it. You think I want to blow a Sunday on a scene like this? You know, I think that we're either gonna have to put mother out here or move the grave into Pittsburgh. She can't make a trip like this. Coming back on the air after an interruption due to technical problems. Nothing wrong with the radio. Must of been the station. Which row is it in? Damn kids. I hate Halloween. Do you remember one time when we were small, we were out here. It was from right over there. I jumped out at you from behind the tree and Grandpa got all excited and he shook his fist at me and he said, "Boy, you'll be damned to hell." Remember that? Right over there. You used to really be scared. Johnny. You're still afraid. Stop it now, I mean it. They're coming to get you Barbra. Stop it. You're ignorant. They're coming for you, Barbra. Stop it, you're acting like a child. They're coming for you. Look, there comes one of them know. I'm getting out of here. Johnny. Johnny, help me! Sorry, Dad. I know I'm a little late. We had a group of college kids walk in 20 minutes before closing. Look, I know you hate Halloween. But I wish you wouldn't be such a bummer. At least pass out all the candy I bought.

I totally just scared Laurie. You did, did you? Oh yeah. She screamed bloody murder. Why is this place such a disaster? It's complete chaos. I can't get either of them to do any of their chores. Thanks. And what about your chores? Uh well, if they don't do theirs I shouldn't have to do mine. It's only fair. Ever think about leading by example? Hey, that's my breakfast. Is this the kind of crap you guys eat when I'm not around? You heard, Mom. This crap is not good for you. What? Why is always me? What about Tweedledee and Tweedledum? I'm offended. I am not dumb. Of course you're not, honey. I just feel like everything is always put onto my shoulders. I didn't ask to be the oldest. Well, you are the oldest and I need you to step up for the next two nights. Wait, the next two nights? I had to pick up the next two nights. Mom, Halloween is tomorrow and I already have plans. I don't want to be stuck at home looking after these dimwits. You won't be stuck at home. You'll be taking your sister trick or treating. Is that his project? Yeah, it's due today. He's been on it 24/7 with Pork Chop. You mean Lawrence? How's he doing? Father Justice Martinez wrote in his journal about a pack of mountain devils. Devils. Slaughtering his entire wagon train. Oh no. Help! Let it go. Little fuck got away. No he didn't. Come on. Come on Where the fuck are you, little bitch? Swear that kids gonna eat my dirt tonight. Hey. What are you doing back there? I, I, I was hiding. From those guys in the van? Yeah. Why? I was at the Diablo's Den... Diablo's Den? What are you doing up there? I was grabbing some establishing shots. What? I'm doing a documentary on Diablo's Den for school. See. Aren't you scared of who's up there? Who's up there? Bloody Bobby. Bloody Bobby? Well they're gone now. Yeah, I better get going. Thank you for not killing me. Listen. Watch your back and be extra careful the next couple of days. You never know who or what's gonna come out of the shadows on Halloween, especially in Fall Creek Valley. Okay, Pork Chop. Just get up and shut up. Keep walking, get on your bike, ride home before you end up in some creepy guy's basement. Bye. How can we not find the fattest fucking kid ever? Seriously, man. Let's go, baby. I'm hungry for a pork chop. Well, well, well. Looks like lard ass had a little accident. No. Did you just piss yourself? No, it's from a puddle, butt breath. You can't stop running that mouth of yours, can ya? Tons of fun here is trying to be funny. How many times do I have to tell you to stop spying on us? I wasn't spying. Then what were you doing up there? Your mom. You fat little. Those assholes. Let him go! Oh you cum buckets are gonna get it now. Laurie, you live here? And Pork Chop is a friend of my brothers. - Yeah! - We were just messing with him, like boys being boys. Looks like a couple of dick less douche bags working through some childhood issues. Hey, I'm not dick less. Not you, sweetie. You got it all wrong, beautiful. Lawrence here is our bro. Yeah a brother from another mother. We were just playing with him. Weren't gonna hurt the kid. I'm sorry if it seems I'm not listening it's just that bullshit meter is ringing so loud it's making my ears bleed. Let's go. You mess with him, you mess with me. Bye Lawrence. You okay? Thanks, Laurie. No problem, Pork Chop. How long have Ace and Judd been picking on you? Everyday for the past two years. Those assholes. And I think I pissed myself. In 1876, a missionary named Father Justice Martinez. How do I look? Like you're sporting a geriatric fall line. Don't worry, honey, you're stuffs in the dryer. It will be ready soon. Good. That means you won't smell like piss for the rest of the day. So what's this all about? Diablo's Den. Diablo's Den? Diablo's Den has been the setting for pretty much tall tale campfire story in Fall Creek Valley. It's this place up by the hills in Burden Pass where all this crazy shit's gone down. Hey, watch your mouth. Sorry, Mom. Some believe it's an old place for satanic rituals. Others believe it's a haunted, unmarked burial site that's a gateway to hell. So Lawrence and I decided to do our report on all the stories and myths behind that place. Looks more like Burkittsville, Maryland. Where? No, Burkittsville was made up for the movie. Diablo's Den is real. Whatever, nerd. Hey, be nice. Okay, time to go. Regan, we're late. Leave the mask here. Shoo, come on, guys. Time for school. I need to change my pants. You guys did a great job with the decorations. - Thanks. - Thank you. I think there's gonna be some scared kids coming trick or treating around here. That's the plan. So I talked to your mom and she said you're gonna be spending the weekend with us. Thanks, Mrs. Peterson. Oh, and honey just because he's spending the weekend it's not gonna get you out of mowing the lawn. I think the shaggy lawn goes good with the Halloween decorations. Oh no, you are mowing the lawn this weekend, sir. Fine. Okay, have a good day, guys. Bye, mom. Bye, Ms. Peterson. See you later. Laurie saved my ass today. So you owe her own. Me? You're the one she saved. You owe her, not me. Hey, ladies. So I am doing a - protest tomorrow night. - I really like this one. - Sweetie, please. - Before the dance and I was really wondering if you guys could just, 'cause I just think, whatever. Who pissed in your cup of coffee this morning? It's just another typical bullshit day in the life of Laurie Peterson. You better back off, okay? I meant what I said earlier. Sorry. I didn't know you knew him. Calm down, what happened? Yeah, don't get your panties in a bunch. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means that I can't get that image of you in your panties out of my head. Hey, beautiful. Hey. How you doing? What's going on? Nothing. Nothing? Laurie almost just carved these guys up. No, it was just a misunderstanding. Nothing to worry about. You see, my brother here is kind of an idiot. Has a tendency to say some dumb shit. What do you guys want? We wanted to see if you guys want to go up to Diablo's Den bonfire tonight. Tonight? Yeah. The game. Game? All you do is sit on the bench, bro. Oh that's funny to you? You think this is for fashion? I'm hurt, asshole. Whatever. Pussy. How 'bout you, Laurie? I'm sorry. I'm just not really interested in getting high with a couple of assholes. Good one. Don't look at me. I'll be doing anything but going to Diablo's Den. You know I'm starting to think you don't like me too much. Just now figuring this out? Well, I'm down. Seriously? What? What, it sounds like fun. And Phoebe's down, too. Sure. Why not? Well, whoever else wants to join us tonight, you know where to find us. Toodles. Rather die. I really hate those dick less douche bags. So annoying. You know you guys have Judd all wrong. I've been tutoring Judd in English. He isn't that much of a Neanderthal. He's actually kind of smart. You can't be serious. Well, he's hot and he definitely isn't dick less. I think she's banging the dick less douche bag. What the hell? Phoebe! Stay out of my way next time Oh yeah? Yeah. Hey, cool off, cool off, cool off. Cool off! You cool, Laurie? Are you? Have you decided what you want to be for Halloween? Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. - So cute. - I know. What's up your butt? You know that Halloween is anti-Christian. So? So? Are you not worried about your soul? Do you want to burn in hell? Yeah, actually I do. You're gonna drag Flash down with you. Didn't you guys used to be friends? Yeah, best friends. What happened? Isn't it obvious? Laurie started to hang out with the popular kids. I'm with you. And to this day, locals refer to this area as Diablo's Den. The most haunted landmark in Fall Creek Valley. Good job, guys. But what is it with the background? It's Diablo's Den. I know it's Diablo's Den. But what is it with all the voodoo dolls hanging from the trees? Production value. Yeah, the combined technical qualities of the methods, materials, or stagecraft skills used in the production of a motion picture or artistic performance. Production value. How did you get your hands on a voodoo dolls? The art department. So Lawrence, where did you obtain those ancient, mysterious skills? YouTube. Told you it was a stupid idea. Well, gentlemen, voodoo dolls and all, you guys did a good job. Anybody that has lived in Fall Creek Valley long enough has heard the tales of went on up there over the years. Like Bloody Bobby? It's Halloween this weekend, so no homework. Have fun and enjoy yourselves. Be safe and always check your candy. Hey, guys, hold up. Can I have a word with you? Where did you hear about Bloody Bobby? This morning, why? Was it from some local crazy guy who looks like he hasn't slept in weeks? I'd say that description is pretty spot on. That is local crock pot and conspiracy theorist Alex Griffin, he is bad news. You guys need to stay clear of him, especially around Halloween. Why? Take a look at this. People are gonna take away from this whatever they want. It's not gonna stop it from becoming some twisted urban legend. Parents are gonna find their kids in the dark, chanting, as if they're trying to channel his spirit and bring him back to life. They're gonna hear their kids whispering, Bloody Bobby, Bloody Bobby, Bloody Bobby, Bloody Bobby. He has spent the last 10 years trying to convince anybody who will listen that Fall Creek Valley's being haunted by an evil demonic spirit known as Bloody Bobby. Sounds like this guys been smoking it up with the Barker Brothers at Diablo's Den. He might be crazy, maybe even dangerous. So play it safe and stay away from him. Gentlemen, when did you post this video? Earlier this morning before school. Why? You, my friends, are a hit. Look. Oh my God, that is awesome. See, I told you the voodoo dolls would work. - Have you seen this movie? - And she was all up in Laurie's face, like you're gonna burn in hell and bring Flash down with you. Oh, hell no. See, she's probably gonna be at Diablo's Den partying with the rest of you. That born again bitch needs to chill the fuck out. Or just get laid. I feel sorry for the poor guy that pops that cherry. I know. You guys, she isn't a virgin. What? Wait really, who? Flash? Flash already told me the whole story though. You know, before she came all self righteous and religious, they dated for like three months in freshman. See, that sex was probably so good, it was like a come to Jesus moment. I'm telling you. Are you still talking to him? Uh, yeah. Wait, I mean I guess that makes sense. That's why she hates you so much. Amen or why I hate her. I bet Flash is amazing between the sheets, too. Don't look at me, I wouldn't know. Wait, you're telling me you guys haven't done the nasty. No. What are you waiting for? You better break that boy off a piece before someone else does. - Like me. - Hey. - Or me. - What? I'm just saying. You got a good guy on your hands. You don't want to make him wait too long and you never know, he might just end up back with Karolyi. Sorry. I was actually thinking of making tomorrow night the big night but that plans gone down into flames. So. Why? Because, look I can't go to the dance. What, why? My mom has to work. So? Well, somebody's got to take Regan trick or treating. Why don't you just have Eliot watch her for a few hours? That's actually not a bad idea. He does owe me after this morning. Not bad, more like brilliant. Okay, so little sis gets to get off for Halloween and big sis gets to get freaky deaky - Halloween costume sex. - Yes, she does. Looks like it's gonna be a good Halloween for the Peterson kids. I don't think Elliot would agree with that. Oh, he'll get over it and like you said he owes you one from this morning from saving his ass from the Barker Brothers. I wish I didn't know about you and Judd. Well, I'm not embarrassed of him. Then why did you keep your little fling a secret? Because you're always so critical about everything, especially when it comes to boys. I'm not critical. I just have time for stupid high school guys. What about Dave from chemistry? That was different, Dave was... I thought this was between me and you. So its okay for the captain to keep secrets but not her crew? It was a one time thing. Why are we making this such a big deal? Because you're the one keeping secrets. Laurie and I are besties. Hey wait, I thought I was your bestie. Got you. Snap that. Please. See, told you I was scary. Yeah, you are. So what time are we meeting at the front of the school? I think I can get out of this nuthouse and be there around nine. Nine works for me. Oh, fashionably late. We can make an appearance that no one can forget. I love it. Hey, Elliot, how did it go? I'm viral. Mom, Mom! What happened? He uploaded a video and it's gotten like 66,000 views since this morning. H, that's impressive. Yeah, kind of a big deal. You've always been a big deal, Pork Chop. So we'll be seeing you. Please be on time, do not be late. Aye aye, Captain. Oh very funny. Mom! Mom, I'm viral. Oh my god? Is it contagious? Mom, not that kind of viral. Oh man, I love this family. Hey Judd, Judd. Ow, this prostate, bro. So better. Money. Delivery. This shit better be worth the top dollar you're charging. Anything we sell is Barker Brother approved. Sounds good. Hey, why you guys taking off so early? The girls, freaked out about being up here so late. The girls? I got it. Would you like a ride? Yes, please. Only the finest for you, my lady. Thanks, amigo. Score. What? Suck on that, you dingle berry. Hey look at this. I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum. So you're basically saying a child who went missing 30 years ago framed your brother? Well it was our fault for bullying him constantly. Little Robert Maxwell with his bloody noses. Come see this. Not right now. This guy's kicking my ass. Lucky bastards homeschooled so all he has to do is play video games all day. I found this clip of Bloody Bobby, it's pretty creepy. Oh son of a bitch. Don't worry about that. Come see this. And what is thought to be a double homicide, former sheriff Ryan Leavitt and his daughter Sarah Leavitt were found dead early this morning in their Fall Creek Valley home. Wait, is that your house? The murderer of the infamous 2008 Fall Creek Valley Massacre. Leavitt resigned after 25 years of service with the FCVPD. Looks like this from nine years ago. Neighbors reported hearing a loud gunshot around midnight. When deputies arrived, they found Sarah Leavitt with a gunshot wound to the head. What the fuck? And Ryan Leavitt's body was found inside the house with multiple stab wounds. There has been nothing said about these murders being linked to the murders a year ago on Halloween. Phoebe? Pheebs? What is that? What is what? I saw that Lawrence ass little fuck playing with these the other day. What for? Hell if I know. What an ugly fucking doll, man. You know, it kind of looks like you. Bullshit. No for real, check it out. It does. It does kind of. What the hell? Put it out of it's misery, bro. What do we have here? What? Looks like you got one, too, asshole. What? Give me that. Let me see it. - No. - Come on. Catch it. - Hey, guys. - Come and get it. Don't you dare, don't you dare. You think this is a game huh? Give it back, give it back. You want some huh? Oh my god, real mature guys. Girls, wait up. So, your mom never told you that someone was murdered here? No. That's messed up. I don't think she even knows. Did you at least get a good deal on this house? What are you guys doing? Whoa, damn, fellas. Why are you so paranoid? Did you know that Bloody Bobby killed two people in your house? Bloody who? A demonic little monster who wants to kill everyone in Fall Creek Valley on Halloween and according to the internet you guys live in the house of the past two victims. Right. Well I wouldn't trust everything you hear on the internet because most of it is bullshit. Well, I'm gonna go to bed. Be sure you're in bed before Mom gets home, okay? Okay, fine. I'm holding you to it. Don't let the bed bugs bite. No one believes anything on the internet these days. Yo, why would that fat little bastard even have voodoo dolls in the first place? I think it has something to do with the project he was working with Elliot on. What project? Something about Diablo's Den. Yeah, I don't know. They posted it today and it already has 66,000 views. Bullshit. No, I'm serious. No, no, no. There's no way in hell that that little shit... Okay, I was wrong. It actually 100,000 views now. What, let me see that. What?

Well, he scared me. He was pretty convincing but it's all just pretend. It was make believe, okay? Can I watch a movie before I go to bed? As long as you watch it in your room. Sweet. Keep this Bloody Bobby thing on the down low. I don't need Regan so freaked out she can't sleep tonight. Yeah but do you think that it was real? 'Cause he sounded really nervous about it. He was just crazy. Remember what Mr. Carpenter said? It's just a stupid urban legend to get kids scared on Halloween. You're scared, aren't you? No. Okay, maybe just a little. System deactivated. Hello? Who's that? Just Eli checking in. Looks like they just got home. That's good. You heard anything from the girls? No. I don't see any of their cars here, either.

Regan, what's wrong? What? There's nothing to be afraid of. Can you leave the light on? Okay. Goodnight. I don't see them in there. I've been calling Judd and Ace and no ones answering their phone.
