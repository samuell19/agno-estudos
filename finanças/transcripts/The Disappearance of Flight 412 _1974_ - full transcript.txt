this is a ufo an unidentified flying object it was photographed at santa catalina island in april of 1966. look at it again closely hundreds even thousands of witnesses have seen similar things appear in the sky persons living miles from others have testified independently that ufos have appeared in a specific place at a specific time I looked up in the sky and objects standing real still then it was going too slow airplane or helicopter it was a large opaque line it had a dull glow to it it was larger than a car flying a treetop level from our height here the official position is firm the evidence is erroneous illusory but if in one thousand reported sightings one tenth of one percent could be fact then that is one real existing ufo good morning colonel moore morning major dunning said he'd meet you at the flight line with 412. early morning a summer day before it was over colonel pete moore and five men of the 458th radar test unit knew they would never forget it it all began with a basically routine but crucial mission involving the alignment of sophisticated airborne radar systems essential to the ultimate defense of the nation the equipment had a recent history of unreliability this reflected on pete moore and on his men he was concerned okay uh you'll hook up with uh blanco vista marine air at 1200 and once they got you you'll be designated shadow delta one are there any questions oh sir we've got it anything that you'd like to add colonel I know I'll be in touch with colonel barnes at blanco's victory i'll see you men back here at 1400 for deep breathing 1400 there goes lunch guys all right pre-flight inspection circuit breakers and what about the radar fix they pinpointed it last night we won't have another abort oh I hope not and what about the general I covered us oh you did huh well how come he chewed me up before breakfast well this time we got the first team up hey how about some lunch I'm meeting a wife say hello to nina for me will you this mission is gonna put my heart through a ringer well you know if we love this man it's gonna be more than your heart that's gonna be put through a ring don't I know air force 412 this is whitney air traffic control you're cleared to taxi to runway 6 right gypsy 92 is holding short roger atc have it in view forward to your cleared his file cleared to blanco vista maintain flight level three one zero heading zero nine seven departure frequency will be one two four point six squat code three one three eight before departure you're clear for takeoff roger whitney squawk three one three eight we are cleared to take off monitor the throttle v1 rotate as 412 climbed gracefully to altitude and the beginning of the exercise pete moore arrived at the 458th headquarters his office morning colonel that was wing again they're really starting to press on our rafter updates oh I'll have to wait well get me uh colonel barnes at blanco vista marina would you yeah colonel barnes hey freeman how's it going we're fine we're right on schedule hey when are we going to play a little golf no I'll get down in one of these days uh hey don't let your guy slip up this time you're here or you sound a little concerned well general enright is on my tail this time we won't let you down pete okay thanks oh I'll leave word where you can reach me uh keep me posted though will you right with the atc this is four one two verify we're climbing out roger four one two amend your clearance climb and maintain flight level three seven engage zero well 12 more days of this and we got 89 days in england hey ferguson you ever been overseas just vietnam sir ferguson it's not at all like england what's that hydraulic pressure 1500 psi block of vista control this is air force 4-1-2 commencing operation shadow delta-1 we are maintaining flight level three seven zero shadow delta one this is blanco vista marine radar control we have you passing through our outboard markers flight 412 easily assumed its new designation shadow delta one as the routine exercise began shadow delta one became something else the hunted what's that hey smitty check with norad on these shadow delta one standby shadow delta one activate all radar units repeat activate all radar units on overhead scan ferguson you got that yeah we got it yeah I got the lights supposed to be a ground response test what's going on shadow delta one check your upper left quadrant roger copy have a look this is blanco vista marine air all aircraft is vicinity squad transponders repeat squawk your codes roger copy my cliff put it on fast scan this is shadow delta one we see three blips at eleven o'clock shadow double one we copied unity two confirming to the experienced men at blanco vista marine radar the blips were real therefore what they represented was real lieutenant take a look at this we just checked with north american air defense command there's no plot on that not supposed to be any planes in that sector at all any malfunctions no hey what are those things i'll tell you one thing guys whatever they are they are pacing us shadow delta one move up as close as you can within your operational altitude we're going to scramble for a look roger we're going up autopilot attention already squadrons 42 000 pressurization 42 000 the men of blanco vista were trained and ready it was their fastest scramble on record communication all right we're leveling but whiskey give me an idea where these guys are I can't see things uh ceiling's now at 41 000. target's at 75 000. they're way up there weigh it we're climbing out twenty thousand feet roger tango one tango two is confirming activating onboard weapons uh speed 500 altitude 42 000 and holding tango 1 passing through 25 000. tango one tango two we're handing you over to radar control roger starting attack approach now here come the marines wow look at them hall angel one turning now roger tango one i'm on youtube tango one and tango two approaching 40 hey where'd they go they're gone ufos are gone what nothing tango one this is frank govista come in please over there tell roy those jets have never been through the cloud they're gone what does rick say rig said that they never came through the cloud tango two come in please come in please tango one tango two do you copy you copy hey my god tango one what had started his simple routine had become the unbelievable the men were stunned shaken higher command was notified foreign further orders we have lost contact with your jets we see no shoots and no debris we are swinging back to search over as a negative channel delta one this mission is scrubbed not deviate from your pattern our people are on the way oh honey I've got to go do you feel like barbecuing tonight oh sure why not let's just come out for a change huh well then i've got to get some tomatoes and onions and mushrooms mushrooms don't excuse me nina uh pete the balloon's just going up but our communications people have just monitored the damnedest crosstalk you ever heard quote this is shouted delta one we have lost contact with your jets we see no shoots and no debris swinging back to search unquote now what was the reply completely unintelligible nobody could dig it out as pete moore left the comfortable surroundings of the base cafeteria shadow delta one was about to chart a course for a strange and unknown destination air force 412 this is norad communications you are being handed off to digger control repeat digger control this is a security transfer your new frequency will be command channel v do you copy roger norad switching over switching channel d on channel dave digger beats me hey you guys are we gonna stay up here all day huh looks like I got another baloney sandwich back there if any of you guys want it you wanted it for you me air force 412 this is digger control do not acknowledge radio communication from this point on come to course zero seven four maintain present flight level and air speed for 30 minutes set zero seven four zero seven four set all right see if we can reach in right somewhere in trouble again i'll raise uh 412. oh mike listen uh get a hold of freeman barnes will you blanco vista have them call me what do I do about this transmission read it to the general it's hard to race 412 for me will you well colonel I don't think we can do that they've been handed off to the north american air defense command norad when just a few minutes ago we'll try anyway yes sir shadow delta one this is whitney communications do you read me shadow delta one this is whitney com whitney com please respond all right if uh major dunning shows up tell him I'm in big operations okay right sir foreign so so so so radar ready okay 412 has been diverted to hollowell air force base wyoming yes sir divergence is right there this came from uh norad anything else I can do for you sir no operation pete I couldn't get anywhere near it right you know for something so hot we sure seem to be getting shoved down the back burner and what about barnes something's cocked out of blanco vista too can't get through then we'd better patch it in or after that right here we go for one dude this is bigger control drop down to 150 feet change course to 173 get 35 miles from touchdown set pressurization for 150 feet as a matter of procedure whitney radar tracked shadow delta 1 until it disappeared yeah i put it on the speaker uh yeah do you have a plot on air force 412 out of whitney being diverted from blanco vista to hollywell yes we do colonel uh 1430. who authorized that diversion well that's all I can give you colonel i suggest you contact blanca vista well i'll do that look we picked up part of a transmission something about uh 412 losing contact with some marine jets have you got anything on that no sir again you'd better contact michael vista very well look if you get anything on that plane you holler for me before you holler for anyone else you hear yes sir oh and uh contact hollywood have bishop call me just soon as he gets here okay where do i find you in my office I gotta get all the barns four one two this is bigger control you were two miles from touchdown hey roy listen I don't show anything on my charts at all just uh one gunnery range about 100 miles east of here well there's something down there four one two make your approach from course one zero five repeat one zero five you'll be on your final touchdown on runway one zero four one two make a right hand turn at the end of the runway taxi to hangar area a couple pull stops off all engines into planes that's the post flight generators alternators inverters off off off battery switch off okay let's find out what this is all about my name's trotman will you come with me wait a minute wait a minute before these guys haul away my aircraft i want to know who's doing it I am sid a special intelligence detachment detached from what work for the same people you do just the tip and division let's get in the truck bishop and his men did not question their surroundings nor the orders given them they had been trained to obey training they would find difficult to contradict what's this all about trump that's what we intend to find out riggs production here ferguson bishop in there oh what the heck is this i don't know very shabby officers club i got air conditioning i got vents well I hope they turn it on yeah let him sweat for about 15 minutes then go yo colonel barnes hey freeman you know you got a hell of a phone situation down there I've been trying to reach you all afternoon listen uh can you tell me what happened to my radar well your plane's okay yeah well we've had quite a morning down here just getting the pieces sorted out we had a radio transmission this well there might have been some kind of mid-air collision no not at all it's those radar systems we've been tinkering with all week you just had a complete failure of all ground and air units in their backups all of them at the same time well that's the way it appears actually your plane has been rerouted to hollowell but our people definitely says something about debris in a search well we had two planes up there too they've also been rerouted to hollow well actually okay you better come in well that does it hallowell has absolutely no word at all on 4-1-2 what I mean they're not expecting our plane no time no how well I just got confirmation from barnes yeah where do you get it we saw it on the board at base operations somebody didn't get the word to wyoming radar why didn't we go there in the first place come on 458 sergeant pierce just sir yeah baseball how about on the line there's colonel moore i see well have uh captain bishop call me as soon as he gets in come inside you know hollywood just confirmed that 412 is doing at 14 30. it's the middle of summer and here we are in a snowstorm you don't think the plane went down oh no no nobody would try to cover a thing like that up but somebody is up to something and I am going to find out what it is this is a preliminary investigation nothing you say will be held against you or used as evidence to incriminate you in any way whatsoever you will now be interrogated by the sid ferguson who made the original sighting marines at blanco business there oh wait look you don't have to call me sir they asked us to activate our radar and to look at a certain sector of the sky what did you see well pedricki reported three dots at 11 o'clock and I confirmed is that what black arrester saw well yeah they gave us the coordinate that's what you reported but they never said they saw it didn't they well they must have seen something you see there's no confirmation on that something appeared and then it disappeared maybe it wasn't even there at all we want to know everything you thought you saw what do you thought we're getting reports in from the marines who are checking their equipment for misalignment what do you mean misalignment they're bringing their radar people in to go over the big dish they're sort of steamed they don't much like it when things go wrong yeah well I i can understand that I wouldn't either if i just lost two jets and those mark nine radar sets I get stories all the time about malfunctions you know what do you mean malfunction now something snatched two jets right out of the damn sky we agree three blips appeared and then disappeared and so did the two marine jets and they're not supposed to you saw them disappear on the radar scope get riggs in here you saw them go well nice let me tell you something about the reliability look the facts are simple blanco vista saw three blips we saw the blips they scrambled two jets the jets disappeared the blitz disappeared now what are you gonna do about it now let's go back over some of the details what are we gonna tell enright i don't know oh sergeant yes sir I understand you were tracking 4 12 this morning did you track it as far up as uh hollywell uh no they went east east yes sir nord handed them off to somebody called digger control um what is digger control i don't know colonel but norah had handled it and did you track him after that yes sir they turned to course 074 and took off in the desert due east until I lost them what do you mean you lost them well they dropped off the scope when they get near the mountains you lost radar contact and you didn't tell anybody major digger control had 4-1-2 I only tracked them because they're heading what do you mean curiosity i've been stationed here 14 months and i've never seen anything flown through that area all right can you pinpoint it for me sure can colonel okay so what what are you talking rich is standing right here now now he saw the jets disappear why don't you ask them what we're talking about blips no really boy you guys you're really a tunnel vision duncan huh you really do okay okay I'll tell you how we can settle this whole thing how all right you're bringing an expert on radar and an expert on aeronautics and you let us talk to them what would you tell them well aside from the most important part namely that rig's got a visual on two marine jets just snapping right out of the sky I saw three radar blips make a right angle turn in mid-air and move off the scope at about 5000 miles per hour now those experts could tell you that no known flying machine or bird of any sort can make such a turn that nothing non-designs can accelerate from 500 to 5000 in one second flat now that is what I saw you can ask rick's what he saw okay clifford what did you see I saw two marine interceptors climbing forward of us now they flew into a cloud and I never came out okay how thick was a cloud seven eight hundred feet okay we have two marine jets moving it better than 900 plus they should have punched through that cloud in less than three or four seconds did they well I just told you they didn't what did your scope show exactly what he saw the jets disappeared and so did those other things they just but you didn't see that you only saw your scopes blips on and off tony this is sounding more and more like electronic malfunction that's exactly what you were sent up there to check out well then blanco vista must have had the same malfunction we did yeah and they're checking that out well they better take a nose kind of just because they are going to come up too short we have no report of two jets missing i'd be very happy to make one look cliff you suffered a trick of the eye now if two jets went down in that area we'd know about it and we don't they didn't go down they just went nothing does that that's what I'm trying to tell you and I'm trying to tell you that we don't deal in science fiction of course 074 would have put them on this heading right here that means they would have gone in here popped over these mountains and back on the radar yes but they didn't so they must be here somewhere but you know something they wouldn't travel at low altitudes for very long they must have landed I'm not on sand there's got to be a base uh the airstrip there's dirt roads here look we got a gunnery range here right with an airstrip no they didn't get that far not over these mountains yeah well no symbols you got a base directory yes it's on the shelf is carol moore it's freeman barnes how's it going lousy maybe if you're open tomorrow we can have lunch just the two of us a little chat yeah well I'm not gonna be free well tonight baby I'm very sorry i really am busy can I call you back no look pete they've sealed up blanca vista a security alert yeah kind of they've pulled my radar people off the line why have you got your people back yet no freeman did the alert have anything to do with that uh radio transmission we picked up about losing contact with your jets we've lost them they've disappeared vanished what off the scopes without a trace is that why they pulled your radar people pete I suppose you know there's a standard procedure for ufo sightings why didn't you tell me about this before i couldn't speak freely before yeah well what is the connection between that and 412 I don't know determination is in other hands special intelligence very strange everybody's operating on a strictly need to know basis well I need to know more than that i don't know how you're going to handle this but well if it ever comes up i never made this phone call what do you mean about radar people look we're we're just trying to find our men right well I've done this here pullman marine air station deactivated 1954 didn't even on the map anymore okay that's my contribution tell me what barnes said no later how are you at desert survival we're going out there well what are we going to tell the general well if we do find our people i'm going to tell him plenty i don't know what we're gonna do when we get there we're gonna get our men out if they're there you think we can just uh walk in say excuse me these are mine and walk out again pete somebody went to a lot of trouble to keep this secret that's for sure what was barnes talking about well it seems that uh tangled with a ufo pete let's go back the men are okay I know they are how do you know that because I was involved in something like this two years ago ufo situation and what happened oh they really raked us over the cold they convinced us that we didn't see a thing and they made it perfectly clear we were involved in the national security situation look I know how you feel about the men i respect you for that but I'm telling you back off now for my own good I can back off now so when blocker vista told you to check that sector you didn't question them at all nope it's not my job to do that but you could have asked them hey fellas what are we looking for it's obvious they wanted an independent observation obvious to you maybe isn't that right what are you guys gonna feed us we'll get around to it ferguson how did you get into the air force academy i was appointed congressman you like what you do sure is he any good at it he's excellent and how do you think he achieved this uh level of excellence my training the united states government laid out a lot of money for that training i appreciate it that's good because when you got through the academy ferguson amongst other things you became an officer and a gentleman yes he did where is all this leading to you're told and it's the truth that you're the best this country has to offer all that's required is that you measure up to what that's the primary obligation of a military officer which is bishop what are your laws lie you questioning my integrity not at all just your level of cooperation what what am I supposed to cooperate with why did you get to the point he can't he's not questioning our integrity he's asking us to dispense with it aren't you all right bishop how did you get into the academy hey fellas coffee sandwiches sale brazil mr cheers here hey listen listen I'll trade you my baloney prince connie yeah a little cream okay yeah it's dead fresh okay who saw the flying saucers well who saw them cliff oh no I uh no I didn't tony i i I just saw some blips good yeah then we can dispense with that huh what about the jets that were dispensed with uh unconfirmed hey how come you guys won't buy a story i'll come hmm because it sounds just like a story but we've dealt with these things before qualified people making unqualified statements now what you thought you saw couldn't happen there's no evidence to make us believe that it could so you didn't see it why don't you finish that sentence we don't get out of here until we swallow that right buster the only thing I'm going to swallow is coffee hey how much longer do we have to put up with this i don't know maybe we don't have to i'll have to think about it this is a restricted area you get that light out of my face sorry sir this is a restricted area i'm colonel moore this is major dunning the i suggest that you call whoever's in charge here and tell him if he has two additional guests you'll understand what I mean i've got a colonel moore and a major dunning here at the main gate sir i don't know what else we can tell you i mean I don't know what else we can get i mean you guys can say anything you want anyway yeah just say that just write it down malfunction I i don't care okay that's pretty generous no the whole thing was the male functions and the time we left whitney the time we got here it's just one great big malfunction i have trotman i'd like to see some id well you would well we'd like to see some of yours what can I do for you colonel you're holding four of my men so I mean so this this whole act here wouldn't be because of a ufo sighting now it's a ufo situation colonel when these things occur it's policy to check out all the personnel involved what do you mean check out piece the whole thing together I see you're um you're investigating is that we're talking to your men can I see them not just yet when colonel this is a matter of national security oh come on that's getting to be a very thin umbrella now I know about national security mister but you can't put that label on everything we get these assignments all the time it's routine routine or not i'm not leaving here without my men on that case one of the two of you make yourselves comfortable I'll have some coffee sending we'll have your men out as soon as possible and how long will that be as long as it takes those were the guys that I was involved with two years ago srd he's probably on the phone right now to end right telling what a pair of clowns we are if you need me I'll get a contract all I have to do is to get to the aircraft race whitney on the radio the colonel can do the rest if someone comes stolen don't rock the boat don't make waves you figure that's the way that majors get to be colonels a certain lieutenant I knew stuck his nose in two years ago where it didn't belong the lieutenant is now a shoe salesman in cincinnati that kind of advancement in life I don't need you're concerned about your position that's right well I'm concerned about more than that so com center this is digger control this is trotman patch me through the digger command hello yes put them through him right now in an interrogation room you ordered this well yes sir the circumstances dictated it if I had refused them entry they may have gone to another authority yes I see well then you did well carmen how are things going with that crew well we just about finished with the men and we should have all of the contradictory evidence we need by tomorrow morning you're very efficient rockman just remember no violence i wouldn't dream of it sir you hear anything at least one of them has some guts i'll tell trump this should be interesting so bishop congratulations we know where you are there's no way to go you're a good airman of a nice try but now return to your room i have a right to go to my aircraft did you hear me yes I can i have a right to go to my aircraft i have a right to call my commanding officer and tell them what's going on what is going on my men and I are being held against our will negative we are conducting a deep briefing under orders you will not be released until you are debriefed debriefing that doesn't make any sense doesn't it you flew some missions in vietnam you were debriefed after everyone yes or no yes and why not here do you think it would make a difference we're not dealing with the enemy here do you know that really do you know everything about national policy or what the military complex is up against do you go back to your room no all right bishop you may go to your aircraft but if you choose to do that it's going to be hard on your men much harder i don't want that you don't all you want to do is get out of here there's only one way you can do it don't make up your mind oh how'd it go come on what you know what you're doing to tell me why just why i'm only looking for the truth the truth tony he wants the truth stormwater forget it hey look we just want to get the hell out of here okay just the hell out whatever he wants to say do right whatever we'll do it all right with anything you want he wants to sign anything with anything record anything he'll agree to any what he wants no we're getting somewhere okay roy let's change the subject shall we if you got an order through the proper channels prohibiting you from discussing matters pertaining to national security would you obey it of course what is your attitude about such an order where's their orders we know that i want an opinion i would think that the air force would have a pretty good reason a practical reason why don't you just just give me an order what's that i'm air force i'm not some wild-eyed coop looking to get on a six o'clock news do you understand you don't have to try to convince me just give me an order something on paper something I show my men we're speaking hypothetically no you weren't you want me to shut up give me an order no that's not it at all I want an order now sit down sit down now tell colonel morty I was meant back now all right let's go now right in there as soon as they're cleaned up colonel hold it i want them as is to being a little dramatic no not really colonel truckman you had my men for 18 hours now they're mine dunning and I are gonna fly them out of here well that'll be fine i'll see that your car gets back to whitney whoa digger control disappeared as easily as it had come into existence leaving pete moore a choice he didn't hesitate what do we tell general enron uh don't worry about it I'm going in with him huh i wish you'd drop it for your sake now don't throw away a career for some lousy ufos that's not what it's about no and what oh for one thing I'd say uh i'd say sanctions sanctions yeah yeah this whole setup here now those men were ordered to work my people over and i'm going to find out who and why but colonel i uh i'm not going to see anybody about anything just give the general my regards all right know general colonel more to see you sir hi pete over here how are you feeling a little tired yeah what's all this at ease man well general I'm gonna tell you the wildest story you've ever heard i've just read it now pete I knew you had initiative but uh you fellas look like you've been pulled through a wine press is that trotman's report yes it is what do you think well very thorough quite an investigation oh yes it was thorough but there was no investigation it's all here yeah the men are here 412 is here the report is here but where are the two marine jets uh what marine jacks the ones I saw disappear sir you are uh captain riggs sir oh yeah well I see nothing here about two jets then sir you're right in the middle of a con job i see captain you did mention this during the investigation at least once every half hour sir excuse me gentlemen will you uh wait inside yes sir you know colonel moore and these men yes sir colonel is this report complete yes sir not one detail has been left out no sir well I see no mention here of a visual sighting on the disappearance of two marine jets scrambled by black vista what about that colonel those are uh reports are under a separate coverage you mean to say you couldn't connect one with the other of course i did why didn't you do something about it that's not my job wait a minute those two missing jets they are confirmed yes sir when yesterday about 12 45. yesterday then why did you hold my men all that time you know those reports were probably written one hour after you started questioning my orders dictate my methods when I get my orders captain I follow them the last time I heard that it came from the docket at nuremberg i wouldn't make hasty comparisons just what are your orders to intimidate to bend to distort the truth so that nobody would recognize it after you're finished with it general what you know the policy I don't what is the policy to investigate any sightings of unidentified flying objects by air force personnel and determine the accuracy of those sightings and what do you do about it the reports are sent up sent up to who that's classified you know I'm not a scientist and neither are you but it seems to me that you got to sort of take a a scientific approach to this either you prove these things exist or you prove they don't exist but you don't pretend they're not there now who sees these reports pete and you're entering an area that doesn't concern you i'm drawing a line here and you don't cross over it what line policy colonel we don't set the policy we act on it we make our reports and that's it any action to be taken comes from somewhere else where will you men please wait outside sit down uh frankly pete the air force doesn't have the time or the funds for tracking down flying sources yes but they do have the funds to maintain places like digger base look sir my men told their story as straight as they could based on what they saw or thought they saw it doesn't make any difference really of course how you get a directive that tells you what to do gives you no latitude at all and you know what you are you're nothing but a laundry processor pete we don't need any of that general what this man does is pointless by instinct I know that his attitude doesn't serve the interests of this country its people or its government colonel officers are not supposed to act on instinct they act on orders and yours are to lay off credit thank you you're going really be noble why don't you do it over something worthwhile now don't misunderstand me I'm just as concerned over this as you are yeah more so what I'm going to show you now is strictly off the record it is not to leave this room this is all we found of the missing marine jets well where was this about 80 miles east of lanca vista but where the crews still looking did trotman know about this he didn't need to it has nothing to do with his job general does this sort of cover up going all the time eight now look at that picture that's the only piece of wreckage we've got that's it that's all there is there's no way in the world we can explain this and it's not the policy of the military to create panic general what are we creating sorry to keep you fellas you hungry no thanks colonel we're sorry that we made things rough for you for me yeah we've talked over sir this whole thing it just isn't worth it go drop it if you say so sir no don't do that remember policies change yeah yeah but not attitudes but they don't last forever only as long as they're expedient pete moore would have pursued the disappearance of flight 412 if he could have found some place to pursue it no one cared and the only reason he could ever find why they didn't care was because they were afraid to cope with it even when it happened again four months later a similar exercise this time everyone was there from the top down planes scrambled objects were sighted everyone was a witness it made no difference everyone was debriefed the file closed the incident forgotten much as was flight 4-1-2 the fate of the men concerned with 4-1-2 has been curious indeed major dunning was promoted to colonel lieutenant podrisky in return for his cooperation was advanced to captain and is presently serving a three-year tour in the pentagon captain bishop is still a captain and is serving a two-year tour in the canal zone pete moore was passed over three times for promotion and retired at minimum age
