-(orchestral music plays) -(chattering) -(doorbell rings) -(gasps) -(woman moans) -Mom? -(heavy breathing) -Mom? -(panting) (panting continues) -Hey! What in God's name are you doing up at this hour? And what is that? -It was on the porch. You didn't hear the bell. -God damn it, Derek! How many times do I have to tell you not to open the front door by yourself? Especially at night! (sighs) Now go to bed. -(door locks) -(low growling) (growling) -What the? -(growling) -("Jingle Bells" plays) -(Santa laughing) -(father gagging) -Tom! Tom! (cries) God! (wails) Tom! -(children laugh) -(laughter) -(Tom's scream echoes) -(gasps) -(riveting) (riveting) -Take her up! -(machine gun rivets) -Here you go, sweetie. I made everything just the way you like it. And, look, nothing's touching 'cause I know you hate that. Come on, Derek. Say something. Talk to me. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I've got to go to the office later. Would you like to come with me? -(knocking) -(machine gun rivets) -Hey. -Hey. -How you doing? -Hello. -Come on in. -How you doing? -Ahh, I'm okay. How are you? -Ooh, I'm good. How's he? -He's still the same. He hasn't said a word since the accident. -What did the doctor say? -The doctor told me not to worry. He told me that it was perfectly natural for a child to stop speaking after a traumatic experience and he said that it was probably temporary. On top of everything else, he won't go into his room now. I don't know. Maybe if I take him out and get him a little something or a toy, it'll make him feel better. I guess I'll take him over to Petto's later. -Nah, don't go there. They haven't got shit in that store. -Hey! Watch your mouth. -What did I say? -(Christmas jingle) -Kim: You know, I can't remember the last time I even bought anything at Petto's. -Sarah: I know. It's so sad. Nobody goes in there anymore. -Kim: I know. -I like place though. Joe's always really nice to Derek. -Announcer: Christmas is right around the corner. And there's always great gifts for the holidays. Call now. -Derek? What's the matter? -Announcer: Don't delay. So call now: 1-800-555-4747. -Derek! Derek, I know you're angry and I know you're scared and you have every right to be... but you also have to remember that you're not alone. Mommy's here with you and I'm gonna protect you and I'm gonna take care of you and everything is gonna be all right. What's the matter, Derek? What is it? Come on, you love to come in this place. Mr. Petto? Joe? Joe? -(screeches) (monstrous gargles) -Pino! Take that mask off. What do you want to do? Scare this little lad half to death? -I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I wouldn't-- -Ha ha, you'll have to excuse Pino. He's a, uh... -A teenager. -Exactly. (laughing) Exactly. Go back into the office. Find something to do. I'll take care of our friends. G-- go on, Pino. Go. I don't know what I'm gonna do with that boy. Spends most of his time making those god-awful masks. How are you, Sarah? -I'm okay, Joe. -I know. I know. I heard about your husband. Fate plays some cruel tricks on-- on us all. How's-- how's the little boy? -He's not so good. -Not so good? What's the matter? Huh? Ooh, what's in your nose there? Watch. Boop. Money? Is that where you keep your money? (laughs) What can I do for you, Sarah? -I would like to buy a present for Derek. -A present for Derek? Come back over here. I think we can find something. All right, watch this. Let's see what we have here. -(mechanical whirring) -(Joe chatters) (Joe laughs) Huh? Huh? (Joe chatters) We can find something here though. Now, watch-- watch his-- watch his tongue when I push his tail. Joe: Take a look at this. A little bank, huh? Here, watch. Huh? A little dog. Oh, here-- here it is for sure. Look at this airplane. -(sighs) Maybe this was a mistake. Wait a minute, Sarah. You're giving up too fast. -(rummaging) -We'll get him. We'll get him. Watch this. (chatters) If there's a way, we'll find it, won't we? -Here, I want you to have this. -What are you doing with that? -It's for the boy, father. I want you to have this. My father made it. -That's a very nice gesture, Pino, but maybe some other time. I think we should go, Joe. -Now, Sarah, you just holler if you need any of my help. -Thanks, Joe, that's really sweet. -(chuckles) I ought to break you in half! What kind of son are you? A real son would help his father, but not you. You keep undermining me. I'd rather have a son like that! -Stay away from me. -You know people don't want to come in the store no more? Do you? It's because of you! -No! -Yes! Because of you-- -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. -Hello there. I didn't see you come in. Is there anything I can do for you, sir? -I'd like to pay for this. -Yes, of course. Just come with me. You've been buying a lot of toys from us lately. Are you playing Santa Claus? -Something like that. -Were you in the service? -Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Do you think you could speed things up here? -Sorry, I-- I was in the second world war. Cash or charge? -Charge, charge. -(cash register dings) -Alrighty. Nothing to do with cash. It's all right, here. Put that down. -(imprinter clacks) -Ninety-one, that's good. fourteen ninety-five, twelve. Six ninety-five. -Come on, speed it up a bit. -Okay, that's twenty-three, ninety-five, if you'll just sign it right there. This nice item will be amazing for your kids. Here we go. All right, have a good grip on the bag. Thanks for coming in! Merry Christmas! -(knocking) (knocking) -You're out of here, brother. -What are you talking about? -Credit's no good. I run a respectable place. I don't have time for this kind of nonsense. -You want to calm down for a second? Look, I just got out of the service. There's plenty of money left in this account. -Not according to that. -Then there's been a mistake and I'll take care of it in the morning. -Uh-huh, you're packing up and leaving right now. -All right, look, what if I give you some cash? -Cash? Cash is good. I like cash. -Great, I get paid tomorrow. -Uh-uh, then you're out of here tonight. -Look, what is it with you, man? You think I'm gonna skip out on you? I paid you for the last two weeks, didn't I? -That was then. This is now. -You got a kid? -Yeah. What the hell has that got to do with it? -You give me till tomorrow, and I'm gonna give you a nice little toy for your kid for Christmas. -Hmm. Hmm. -Well, you don't look like a deadbeat. I guess so. -Great. -Mother-- What you doing in there? -Here you go. -This better be good. -Oh, yeah, it's to die for. Hey, remember, don't open it 'til Christmas. -Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. -(car seat clips) -(car engine starts) -(vocalizing) (vocalizing continues) (vocalizing) What the-- What the hell is this? I'll be a son of a bitch. Yeah. (laughing) This something? -(toy crunching) -(laughs) Look at that thing. (chuckling) Hey, hey. Hey. How do you shut this thing off? What? The damn thing's not working. The damn thing's broken. (humming) (humming continues) -(buzzing) -What? -(chirping) -(gagging) (strangled scream) (gagging) (gagging continues) -(tires screech) -(chirping, crunching) -(eyeball squelches) -(thunderous boom) -(locks clicking) -(clocks ticking) -(floorboard creaks) (floorboard creaks) (floorboard creaks) -(door creaking) -(clicking) -(footsteps approach) -(cork pops) -(sharp exhale) (footsteps) (receding footsteps) -(thumping) -(grunting) (grunting continues) (screams) (screaming) Let go! -(thumping) -Sarah: Derek. Derek, where are you? -(Christmas music plays) -Derek? Derek, where are you? -(Christmas music plays) -Derek. Derek! -(music stops) -Didn't you hear me calling you? No, it's 'cause you play that thing too loud. Come on now, you don't want to keep Santa waiting, do you? Did you make a list for Santa? No, it doesn't matter. What's this? -It says it's to you, but it doesn't say who it's from. I bet it's from Kim. It's just like her to do something like that. Now don't get any ideas. We don't open it 'til Christmas. Come on, Derek. -(chatter) -Come on, he'll be back soon. -(sighs) -Hey, how are the little germ carriers today? Huh? -Oh, not bad. -I only got pissed on twice. Oh, man, is it hot out there? Nothing like a California Christmas, huh? -(chuckles) Nothing like that California cutie we have for an elf. Ho ho ho! -(laughing) -Hey, Ricky, you seen the boss? I got to ask him about my check. -Uh, yeah, yeah. I think he's out front somewhere. -Oh, great. -(mall-goers chatter) -Let me go on for you. -What are you a masochist or something? -Listen, God damn it! Just let me take your shift! -Okay, settle down. Sure, no problem. -(dog barking) -(chattering) -Santa, this is Brandy. -Hello, Brandy. -I don't really believe in Santa, but just in case... -(paper unfolding) -I want clothes, clothes, and more clothes, but if you don't have that many clothes, I want a ten-speed bike, a new pair of earrings, a watch, a pair of sunglasses, a VCR, a yellow photo album, and the tape of Bride of Reanimator. -Smile. -Brandy: Bye, Santa. -Merry Christmas. -What's your boy's name? -Derek. -Santa, this is Derek. -Derek, do you want to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? Well, if you don't tell him, he won't know what to bring you. -Maybe you'd rather whisper in my ear. -(sighs) Okay, baby. I'll take you home. Come on. -No! -Let go. -Don't go. -What are you doing? -No! -Let go of him! -No, don't go! -No. Maniac. -Smile. -Hmm. -Are you still upset about Santa? Well, I guess even Santa has a bad day. We won't do any more shopping. We'll go right home, okay? -(car engine starts) -(squeaks) -(squeaking) -(honking) -(dog barking) -Come on, Derek. -I'll be in in a minute. -Sarah! -Hi. -Hi, did you just get home? -Yeah, a few minutes ago. -Derek's with you, right? -Yes, why? Is there something wrong? -Well, I'm not sure, but, um... I was walking by a few minutes ago and I thought I saw someone moving around inside. -What? -I could be wrong, though. -Oh my God-- Derek! Derek! Derek! God. Derek! God! - (Christmas music plays) -Oh, Derek. (relieved chuckle) - (Christmas music plays) -(gasps) Pino! -Sarah. -What in God's name was Pino doing in my house? -What? -He was in my bedroom. He scared me and Derek half to death. -Oh, there must be some mistake. Pino was with me all day. -Don't lie to me, Joe. I saw him. -Pino wouldn't do anything like that. -I don't want to hear it! I want an explanation and I want it now or I'm gonna call the police! -Don't call the police. Listen to me. You don't have to do that. Maybe I can clear this whole thing up. You see, I... I used to own your home. -What? -I used to live in your house. Pino and I, we lived there for many years. -Well, what happened? Why did you move? -Well, it's-- It wasn't by our choice. You know, my business began to go downhill and the bank foreclosed on me. We had to move here and things haven't been the same since we moved here. Pino's been crying about wanting to go back to the house. "I want to go back to the house," he kept saying. Maybe that's-- that had something to do with what happened today. -Look, Joe, I'm sorry about your bad luck. I really am. But just because you used to live in the house, it doesn't give Pino license to break-in whenever he feels like it. I have a little boy at home. I can't have him doing that. -Of course. I understand, Sarah. -Understand this, if it happens again, I will call the police. -Sarah, it's not gonna happen again. You hear me? It's not gonna happen again. Okay? -Okay. -(cuckoo clock chirps) -Pino: No! No! Go away! Leave me alone! -You have to come up some time, Pino... and when you do, I'll be waiting for you. -Sarah: Derek. I know I said we weren't gonna open presents until Christmas, but I don't think one would hurt. Go ahead, open it. Don't you want to? All right. (sighs) You don't have to if you don't want to. -(doorbell rings) -That must be Kim. -Hi. Oh. -Hi. -Thanks for coming over and thanks for that Christmas present. That was so sweet of you. -What Christmas present? What are you talking about? -Oh, didn't you leave a Christmas present for Derek on the front steps? -Uh-uh. -Oh, well, I was sure it was you. Huh. I've made some potato chips. -Kim: Yeah, great. So what's going on? -I just had the worst day. Is it me or has the whole world gone crazy? I can't make sense of anything anymore. -Look, Sarah, it's human nature to want nice, neat answers to everything, but unfortunately life doesn't work that way and a lot of things can't be explained. (sighs) I mean, you would not believe the things that I've been through. I hardly believe them myself. -Well, all I know is I can't go on this way anymore. I have to get our lives back in order, back into a normal routine. I really think that's best for Derek... and for me. -You know what I always say. Just trust your instincts. -That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Derek? Are you all right? -What was that all about? -She was gonna call the police! Do you know would'a happened if she'd done that? You stupid, stupid fool! -Shut up! I've had enough! -(screams) -You're drunk! You're always drunk! -Don't you turn your back on me when I'm talking to you. Wait a minute! Where do you think you're going? -I don't have to listen to you anymore! -(grunting) (screams) You bastard! Son of a bitch! -I'm sorry, father. I'm so sorry. -You son of a bitch. (triumphant laughs) (laughing) (screams) (screaming) -(panicked yelps) -Pino! Pino. I'm sorry. Pino! I'm sorry. Pino. Pino! Oh, God, what've I done? -(girl giggles) -Hi-ya, Lonnie. -Hey, what ya doing, squirt? -Are you blind or just dumber than you look? -Don't be a wise-ass. I eat kids like you for breakfast. It's why my shit smells so bad. (snickers) -What an asshole. -Hey, what'd you call me? You little shit. -Beat it, butt-head. -(chuckles) -Cheer up. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve and things are only gonna get better. -(sighs) -Ricky: Santa Claus killer... -(Laura screams) -Hank: Get the hell out of here. -(Laura screams) -Dr. Newbury: Laura, It's okay, it's a dream... -Derek, honey, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I want you to sleep in your own room tonight. Now, there's nothing to be afraid of. Just try it for one night and I promise if it doesn't work out, you can come right back in here and sleep with me. Will you do it for me? Please? I want you to go right to sleep. Come on. I'll be right here if you need me, honey. -Look out! -(Lonnie laughs) -Son of a bitch! You're dead! -(laughing) -(wheels whir) -(sparking) -Whoa! Help! Help! Help! (distant screams) Can't stop! Help me! Help! -(Christmas music plays) -Lonnie: Help me! Help! (screaming) (screams) -(toy fizzles) -(Christmas music plays) -Whoa! (screaming continues) -(sparks blast) -(toy crunches) -(screams) -(crunching) -(screams) -Derek! -(screaming) -(tire screeches) -(mumbling) -Over PA: Dr. Gladsky, please report to O.R. Dr. Gladsky, please report to O.R. -Couldn't make 'em stop. Stop. -Over PA: Dr. Server, pick up line one. -I couldn't... -(hospital chatter continues) -His pulse is strong. Don't worry, he's gonna be fine. -Kim: I love you, honey. -Hello. -Hi, how are you? -Hi. -Oh, tell me. -Thanks for coming. -I'm sorry I can't stay very long. I've got to get back to the office. How is he? -The doctor said he'll be fine, but look at him. -What a terrible accident. -Sarah, you think this is an accident? Look. -What's this? -You tell me. -(doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) -Hi, Derek, hi. You don't know me, but I-- Let's just say I want to be your friend, okay? And, hey, look what I brought you, huh? Look at that. You'll find a very special toy in there. A very special toy for a very special boy. Oh, come on, Derek, It's okay. I want you to have it. Take it. -What do you want? -Who are you? -I'm the babysitter. Who are you? -I'm a friend of the family. I'm looking for Mrs. Quinn. Is she home? -She's working late. You'll have to contact her at the office. -(locks) -Hey, wait! Open the door. Hey, what are you doing? Open the door. -Go away! -Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. I told you I'm a friend. Come on, let me in. I just want to use the phone. -I'm not supposed to let anyone in. -Come on-- Just tell me where Mrs. Quinn works. I'll go see her there, okay? -1200 Market Street, 5th floor! -Thank you! -(door closes) -(metal sliding) -Shit! -(key clanks) -Oh-- sh-- God! -Sarah. -(gasps) Ah. -(both panting) -As he yawned and stretched and scratched his head, he felt two furry ears growing from his head. How amazing? Straight away, he searched the room for a mirror without success. So he filled a basin with water and peered down at his reflection. Yes, there they were, a pair of donkey's ears. He felt shame and grief and anger in turn. He cried, enraged, and beat his head against the wall. Yet the more he roared, the longer his ears grew. (gasps) -What took you so long? -He wouldn't go to sleep. Mrs. Quinn's gonna be home soon. -What are we waiting for? -(giggling) -What's your story? Come on. -(laughing) You-- stop. (laughing continues) Come on. (laughs) Buck, come on. -(both laugh) -Jeez, what are you doing? -I don't have the right tool to get in your car. So I guess you have two choices. You could break your window or... you can let me give you a ride home. -I'll take the ride. -Okay. -What? -Why did you run from me? -God, I don't know. I guess I panicked. I couldn't believe it was you. You scared the hell out of me. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Things have been pretty crazy around here lately, but I'm glad you're here. I really am... but it's been six years since you left and I guess I never thought I'd see you again. -Is that true? Or did you see me every time you looked at Derek? He's my son, isn't he? -Yes. -Damn it, Sarah. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant? -Would it have made any difference? -It was my child. I had a right to know. -I wanted to tell you, Noah. I really did. I-- I-- I wanted to tell you. I did. I loved you so much... but you weren't ready to settle down, Noah. You know that. -All I know is that you could have trusted me to do the right thing. -I did what I had to do. I wanted to finish college. I wanted a career. And I needed security for that and you couldn't give it to me and Tom could. -Listen to me. I did a lot of growing up when I was in the army. I know what's important now. I want to be a good father to my son. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. -(both panting) (panting continues) -Oh, jerk. -(moans) (moans) -It's in front. -(laughing) -Oh, don't rip it! -No, I can get it off. -(moaning, panting) -(booth giggling) -(snaps) -Bingo. (laughs) (kissing) -(panting) -Oh, God. (moaning) -Oh, sorry. -(girl laughing) -(moans) -(panting) -(whimpers) Ooh, ooh. I really... (laughs) -(laughing) -Yes. (barks) -(laughing) -Buck. -Oh, baby. -Buck, where did-- Where did all these toys come from? -What? -Toys. -I don't know. They were here when we got here. (kissing) -I don't-- I don't remember seeing them. -(pants) We weren't really paying much attention now were we? (kissing) -(gears whir) -(kissing) -(moaning) -Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, that-- That feels good. Oh, you never touched me there before. -What? -No, no, no. Put it back. Put it back-- Put-- put-- Put it back on. -What? -Oh, never mind. -Stop. -Stop what? -Stop. -You could use some lotion, honey. -(hissing) -(gags) -Buck! -Oh! -(screams) -(both scream) -Help! (screaming) -(screams) -(screaming) -(grunting) -(screaming) -(gunshot) -(gunfire) -(screaming) -(screams) -(blades whirring) -(both screaming) -(squelching) -(screaming continues) -(maniacal laughter) -Sarah, what do you know about that old guy from the toy store? -You mean Joe Petto? -Yeah. -Nothing really. Just that he's a nice man, why? -What if I told you he was arrested for maiming some kids several years ago? -What? -He owned a toy store in Grove City when I was a kid. -They arrested him one Christmas for booby trapping toys. He'd rig 'em with lethal devices and then he sent them to kids all around town. A couple of kids got hurt pretty bad. I think one of them even died. -I don't believe it. -Sarah, believe it. I was there. -What reason could he have to hurt innocent children? -From what I remember, he went off the deep end when his wife was killed in a car accident. She was pregnant at the time. -Oh my God. -I guess he felt if he couldn't have a happy family, nobody else would. The moment I saw that toy store, it all came back to me. I got worried about you and Derek so I did some snooping around, bought a bunch of toys from Petto. Took 'em apart, checked 'em out, see what I could find. -And? -Nothing. -Oh God, Noah, I want to go home. -Okay. -(dog barking) -Noah: Sarah, wait. What do I tell Derek? -You can tell him the truth. He's a smart little boy. He understands a lot more than you think. Just don't expect any miracles from him, that's all. He's been through a lot. -Okay. -(screams) -Help me, please! Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! (cries) -Hey, easy now. What happened? -Toys! Buck's dead! Buck's dead! -Where's Derek? Where's Derek? -He took him. -Who took him? Where? Who? -The man from the toy store. -Joe Petto? -Yes. -Oh God! -(mechanical whirring) -(screams) -Noah: What the hell's that? All right, look, now get inside. We'll call the police. Come on, come on. It's okay. It's okay. Come on, come on. It's okay. Where're you going? -I'm going to get my baby! -Sarah, no! Let the police handle this. Sarah? Sarah! Sarah, come on! God damn it! -Oh my God, what happened? -I don't have time to explain. Just call 9-1-1. Stay with her and send the police! -Send them where? (tires screeching) -(banging) -Petto! Petto! Petto! Petto, where are you? You bastard! I want my boy! You hurt him and I swear I'll kill you! Do you hear me? -(mechanical whirring) -Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, where are you? Oh, shit. Sarah? -Derek. -(panting) -Oh my God. -(buzzing) -(gunshot) -(grunts) -(gunshots) (gunshots) -(screams) (sighs) -(screams) -Noah? (gasps) -(electrical buzzing) -(bubbling) -(slight gasp) (screams) (gasps) -I knew you'd come. Pretty mommy. -Let go of me! Who are you? -(metal clicking) -(rubber stretches) -Pino? How-- how in God's name-- -Oh, this is very simple. Really, it's very simple. All you need is a little of that and a little of that and a little of that. My father taught me how. My father taught me a lot of things. -(door slams) -(locking) -Not smart. -You killed him, didn't you? You killed Joe. -I had to. He broke me. He always broke me. And even though he always fixed me, I had to be sure this time that he didn't hurt me anymore. -Oh my God. -I tried to be a good boy, father. All I ever wanted to be was a good son to you, but I could never be a real son to him. I could never be that. That's all he ever wanted, was a real son, a real son like Derek. -Where's my boy? -His real son died before he was even born. That's why he made me. My father could make anything. Well... almost anything, but I wasn't good enough. He never thought I could love him like a real son can. When he found out I rigged those toys and sent them to your house, he was so angry with me, but don't you see? I had to. Derek has to die. Then you can be my mommy -Damn you! Where's Derek? -You don't need Derek! I can be your son now! I can! Don't you see? That's why I took him. I knew you'd come. I knew you'd come! -Get away from me! -I can love you like a real son. I can. I can. I can. I can! I can! I love you, mommy! I love you! I love you! I want you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! -(screams) -(grunts) (strangled scream) -Damn you! Where's my boy? I want my boy! -(screams) -(sparking) -(explosions) -(electrical buzzing) -He wanted a... real boy. I wasn't... good... enough. -I want my boy! What have you done with him? -I'm your son now! Not him! Not him. -(cloth ripping) -No! Don't hurt my baby! -(quiet whimpers) -Not him. -Don't! Don't kill him. You can be my son. You can come home with me. Don't kill him. -Sarah! -We're in here! Help us! No, Pino! -(door clacking) -Sarah! Hang on! I'm coming. -No! Pino, don't! You can be my boy. You can be my son, anything you want. We'll go home together. Anything you want, Pino. -(whimpers) -Don't hurt Derek. -No! Derek has to die. It's the only way. -No! Don't! -(grunts) (choking) -Mommy, help! -Derek! -Help me, mommy. -Derek, let go! -(banging) -Mommy, help me! -(banging) -Mommy, help me. -Noah! -Mommy! -Grab him! -(screams) -Ahh! (grunts) (grunts in pain) Ahh! (groans) -Father! Father! Help me. -(harsh breathing) My baby. -Father. All he wanted was a son. He... made... me! (crying) Father. Don't leave me! -It's okay. You're safe now, Derek. I'm gonna take care of you. -Mom, who is he? -(laughing) -I'll tell you when we get home, honey. (screams) -Mommy! -Die, you son of bitch! -Don't be afraid. It's only a toy, mommy. -That's right. It's only a toy. -Let's get the hell out of here. -Just a toy. -(laughing) -(orchestral music plays)
