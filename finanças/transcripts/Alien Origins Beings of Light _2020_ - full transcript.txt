- What we will reveal here, is of profound importance to mankind, both now and in the future. Truths have been hidden from us for hundreds of years. Few have glimpsed the secrets that history forgot, and have even been abused for their insight. Few have glimpsed the secrets that history forgot, We have made contact with beings from another world, another dimension. We have made contact with beings from another world, These beings hold information so old, and so incredible, that our ancestors called them gods. These beings hold information so old, Today, we call them aliens, and seek out their existence on other planets, Today, we call them aliens, but we seek them in the wrong places. All the great mysteries of history will now suddenly become clear, from crystal skulls, to the great pyramid of Egypt, and more. All of history will seem strange to the great pyramid of Egypt, and more. When we emerge on the other side of this grand journey we are about to take. When we emerge on the other side of this grand journey Come with us now, and discover what history forgot. In order to help us understand this, we need to begin by consulting a paper In order to help us understand this, that was presented to the United Nations in 1996, by Ingo Swann. The paper and presentation was entitled, "On-Going Scientific Discovery of Sensory Receptors "Which Account for Many Subtle Perceptions," "On-Going Scientific Discovery of Sensory Receptors and deals initially with the concept of modern Western science. Swann points out that our senses are limited simply to the five standard senses, as taught in school. However, the whole purpose of the paper was to broaden this horizon, However, the whole purpose of the paper and explain to the delegates that this was a false perception. There were in fact dozens of senses that science itself had discovered since the 1930's, There were in fact dozens of senses and yet steadfastly refused to bring them into balance with the psychic and religious understanding of these receptors. Swann points out that for thousands of years of these receptors. The ancient shaman, medicine man, or mystic has believed in more than five human senses in relation to the Earth and the Universe around him, and that now science was the one catching up. In relation to the Earth and the Universe around him, In his paper, Swann explained that there is now hard scientific evidence for the senses some would say are in the remit of para-science. Swann outlines five categories for these new senses as follows, Swann outlines five categories minute chemical receptors and sensors, minute chemical electro-receptors and sensors, minute chemical receptors and sensors, neural network exchanges of information in the bio-internal body substrates, neural network exchanges of information bio-electromagnetic information receptors and sensors, bio-information transfer networks at the atomic, molecular, and neurological levels. As Swann then points out, these can sound complex at first to the uninitiated, but taken simply, they outline even to the casual observer these can sound complex at first to the uninitiated, that there are many more senses than the standard five we currently believe in. That there are many more senses than the standard five A nice way to conceive the whole of this, is to comprehend that every cell, possibly every atom in our bio-physicality, is a receptor or sensor of some kind. Possibly every atom in our bio-physicality, So, we have more senses than touch, smell, taste, sight, and sound. Our whole body is full of subtle sensors, and even bio-information transferring networks, Our whole body is full of subtle sensors, which simply put, means a method of dispersing the information around the body, once received. We are a walking, talking, and communicating satellite dish, the information around the body, once received. That is far more complex and receptive than we ever imagined. This goes along with what many ufologists state, than we ever imagined. That they can sense beings, that they know inside themselves that they can sense beings, we have and are being visited. One of these categories in particular relates to the existence within our bodies of minute physical and chemical relates to the existence within our bodies bio-electromagnetic receptors that interact with the information processing resources, spreading information around the body, that interact with the information processing resources, that the body is receiving. This information is constantly bombarding our bodies, and being dispersed. This information is constantly bombarding our bodies, It is being understood, even at a conscious level. Take for instance, the vomeronasal system, or nose, which picks up at a bio-subliminal level the minute chemical signals of another person. Which picks up at a bio-subliminal level This system can easily detect pheromones, and hormonal signals from another person, and arouse, for instance, a sexual desire, and hormonal signals from another person, which in turn emits a similar signal. We as humans are both aware of this effect, through becoming aroused and flushed, We as humans are both aware of this effect, and yet unaware that we are immediately and effectively sending signals back. This effect is on a chemical level, but the chemical is being dispatched via electromagnetic means, both internally and externally. Via electromagnetic means, Is there any similar scientific evidence for external electromagnetic energy information? Swann was already there with this one, and goes on to explain that scientists can and have measured and begun to classify the brain's electrical activity that scientists can and have measured outside of the scalp. Could there really be evidence of brain activity outside of the scalp. External to the brain? This has in fact led to discoveries that bioelectric activity extends to some distance beyond the skin, which in turn has led to the discovery to some distance beyond the skin, of bioelectric sensors, not only in the skin, but in the neural peptide activity that transmits all kind of subtle sense information through the immune system, and into the brain, that transmits all kind of subtle sense information and back again, into the body's extremities, and all its internal organs, including its surrounding biomagnetic field. Now discovered bio-electromagnetic fields extending outside the scalp, and outside the skin, Now discovered bio-electromagnetic fields clearly equate to the auras that many clairvoyants have specialized in seeing. Clearly equate to the auras Preempting this discovery in 1977, Bob Becker, in "Psycho-Energetic System: Volume II," under a paper entitled, Bob Becker, in "Psycho-Energetic System: Volume II," "An Application of Direct Current Neural Systems "to Psychic Phenomena" states, "The concept of a primitive "electronic communication system in all living things, "The concept of a primitive "can be a useful tool in understanding "both normal and paranormal phenomena "that have lacked a rational biological explanation. "Indeed, it appears that human beings "are tied to the Universe "in a web of electromagnetic energy." "are tied to the Universe So scientists themselves believe that the universal web of electromagnetic energy So scientists themselves believe could explain many paranormal phenomena. And yet society is told by those in authority that no such thing is possible, and the real facts are hidden in complicated and confusing scientific papers. Getting back to Swann's paper, he explains that the soles of your feet, and the palms of your hands, he explains that the soles of your feet, contain minute magnetic receptors and sensors that recognize minute and gross changes in local magnetism. The ancients understood electromagnetism in their own way, and were not bound by the modern day perceptions that this power or energy was weaker and were not bound by the modern day perceptions than the chemical energy of the bio-form. The two go hand-in-hand naturally. Our ancestors knew this because they had been taught it The two go hand-in-hand naturally. By ancient aliens they called gods. More an that soon. By ancient aliens they called gods. Ancient structures were erected with electromagnetism in mind, for long-distance communication. Why? For long-distance communication. For communication with aliens. Feng shui, and the serpent energy pathways of modern ley line hunters are truly electromagnetic paths that man understood, and had the receptors to be able to read. The fact that we have receptors in our hands and feet, comes as no surprise when we consider the methods used to discover these Earth energies, which involves dousing, standing on the ground, and holding special rods as an antenna extension of the body, to pick up the subtle energies, but there is so much more. To pick up the subtle energies, Swann continues with a list of the senses and receptors, receptors in the nose, Swann continues with a list of the senses and receptors, sensing systems that smell emotions, and that can identify motives, sensing systems that smell emotions, sexual receptivity, antagonism, benevolence, et cetera, receptors in the ear, sensing systems that detect and identify differences in pressure, and electromagnetic frequencies, sensing systems that detect and identify skin receptors that detect balance and imbalance regarding what is external to the bio-body, even external at some astonishing distances, skin receptors that detect motion outside the body, even when the body is asleep, directional finding and locating receptors in the endocrine and neural peptide systems, whole body receptors, including hair, that identify fluidic motions of horizontal, vertical, diagonal, even if not visually perceived, skin receptors that recognize the temperament vertical, diagonal, even if not visually perceived, of other biological organisms, subliminal sensory systems, which locate and identify pitch of sound, a sense of heat across great distances, a sense of frequencies and waves, either mechanical or energetic, receptors that identify positive and negative charged particles at the atomic level, micro-system tranducing of various forms of mechanical, chemical, and electromagnetic energy into meaningful nerve impulses, of mechanical, chemical, and electromagnetic energy receptors that sense gravitational changes, neurological sensors for interpreting modulated electronic information neurological sensors for interpreting by converting it into analog signals for mental storage, interpretation, and cognition, bio-electronic receptors for sensing radiation, including X-rays, cosmic rays, infrared radiation, bio-electronic receptors for sensing radiation, and ultraviolet light, all of these receptors being found in the retina of the eye, receptors that respond to exterior electrical fields and systems, skin receptors for sensing perceptions of bonding and antagonism, senses for nonverbal language, of bonding and antagonism, communicating or telepathy, this has now been superseded by the discovery of quantum entanglement, whereby two minds have been found of quantum entanglement, to entangle at the quantum level, combined sensing systems on neural networks for making meaning out of at least 130 identified nonverbal physical gestures, and 20 basic kinds of nonverbal messages, nonverbal physical gestures, receptors that trigger alarm and apprehension before their sources are directly perceived, receptors that trigger alarm and apprehension sensing systems for registering and identifying nonverbal emotional waves, senses and memory store cycles of light and darkness, anticipating them with accuracy, as the daily motions of the sun and moon change, senses in response to solar and lunar rhythms, solar disruptions, such as flares or sunspots, and moon-caused tidal changes, solar disruptions, such as flares or sunspots, whether fluid or geophysical ones, and can sense coming earthquakes and storms. This amazing list of scientifically accepted receptors and sensors within, and indeed without the human body, is quite remarkable, and links in much of what the paranormal and ufology fraternities speak of. Much of what the paranormal We must also add now a growing scientific trend towards the idea of a sense of time, which is being shown to be more than simply a perception of the mind, but also a biological and evolutionary function, than simply a perception of the mind, even so far as to the concept of evolutionary internal device, to enable mankind to predict the future. Of evolutionary internal device, What we do have here is stark scientific reality, which appears to be verging What we do have here is stark scientific reality, on the edge of the world of the paranormal. In the world of the mystical etheric matter, referred to in alchemy and Eastern mysticism, as the subtle matter, we have some explanation of what the ancients believed in. This etheric body was external to our own, and yet was our own. It is the energy aura, and is claimed to react to different frequencies of nature, It is the energy aura, because our energy is linked to that or our surroundings. In fact, where illness is present, the frequency of the etheric body is said to change color. This has been shown in Kirlian photography. The Nobel Prize-winning physicist, David Bohr, has actually presented some convincing scientific evidence for what he called, "the implement order of the holographic universe." This holographic universe is made up of this etheric body, spoken of by Eastern mystics and others, This holographic universe is made up of this etheric body, and is something to which we shall return. Bohr believed that information was actually embedded within the fabric of space and matter, or energy. This in turn, actually agrees with Einstein's popular theory, E equals MC squared, where he proposed that energy was matter, and vice-versa. Today, we find thousands of New Age practitioners of what is known as vibrational medicine, popularized a great deal by Doctor Richard Gerber, in his book, "Vibrational Medicine." This new healing technique calls upon the ancient idea of the etheric body, and the subtle vibrating energy, which surrounds us, encapsulates us, of the etheric body, and the subtle vibrating energy, and is indeed within us. This in turn, and surprisingly to many, actually relates to modern scientific discoveries, as outlined in Swann's UN presentation, actually relates to modern scientific discoveries, namely that we are receptors and sensors of this energy, and that it affects us in many ways. If we can indeed pick up this energy, then there is little wonder that it does make changes to our own bioelectric magnetic body, for good and bad. Make changes to our own bioelectric magnetic body, Many people who have come in contact with beings from other dimensions, or aliens, state quite clearly, that they are often bodies of light, that they sense them, rather than see them. State quite clearly, that they are often bodies of light, This is in fact nothing new. It was spoken of thousands of years ago, and it is where we get our angels from. Well over a thousand years ago, Ja'far al-bdiq, a Moslem scholar, teacher, and alchemist, stated, "there are some lights, which, "if thrown from a sick person to a healthy person, "can possibly make that healthy person sick." This was al-bdiq's way of explaining vibrational medicine. Scientists today are admitting that it is theoretically possible Scientists today are admitting for disease to occur at the cellular and biomolecular level, and it is this which affects the greater body. This, it is claimed, is based upon vibration or resonance, which is termed in the world of the mystics and the scientists alike, as the life force. These life forces possess electromagnetic energy, and the scientists alike, as the life force. Which give it the vibration. It is this electromagnetism that al-bdiq is talking about, which give it the vibration. When he says, lights. And he calls them lights because he could see them, and so too can many more. Society today calls them mad. And so too can many more. Now, according to many religions, the laying on of hands to the head, results in the healing process, which is now termed, vibrational medicine. We have already seen that both the hands and the feet are receptors and sensors of magnetism, We have already seen that both the hands and the feet but the hands are also strangely on the same frequency as the brain. In this respect, we can see how this subtle energy could have ramifications for the world's ancient religions. This laying on of hands is normally part of a much wider ritual involving meditation or prayer, This laying on of hands is normally part which has been found to turn negative frequencies into positive ones. Which has been found to turn negative frequencies A paper by Doctor William H Philpott, entitled, "The Value of Using Negative Magnetic Energy A paper by Doctor William H Philpott, "in Diabetes Mellitus," and which refers specifically to the use of magnetism "in Diabetes Mellitus," in the healing of diabetes patients, states specifically, it is the energy of magnetism, which makes biological responses possible. For years, it was customary to consider magnetism which makes biological responses possible. As one unit of energy. However, it has been demonstrated conclusively that magnetism is two energies that have However, it has been demonstrated conclusively opposite biological effects, when these energies are separated. Opposite biological effects, It is the balance between these two energies that governs metabolism. It is the balance between these two energies Magnetism is a push and pull system. The clockwise spin of a positive magnetic field pushes, Magnetism is a push and pull system. And the counterclockwise spin of a negative magnetic field pulls. This can be illustrated by the energy of a moving object, such as a car. The front end of a car pushes, while the back end of a car pulls, The front end of a car pushes, yet the moving car is one unit of energy. Light energy is the balance between these two systems. Biological light has a balance. Philpott then explains how this magnetic energy has been shown to have effect. The positive magnetic pole is inflammatory invoking, and the negative magnetic pole The positive magnetic pole is inflammatory invoking, is anti-inflammatory and inflammatory-resolving. To him, it is critically important that we come to an understanding of this magnetic phenomena, especially as he has shown that using a negative magnetic field, he has controlled acid and inflammation amongst other things. Modern and ancient methods of healing and inflammation amongst other things. Also involve certain tools, such as flowers, color, and crystal therapy. Also involve certain tools, Doctor Philpott had discovered for himself, magnetic energy can be a great healer. But with all due respect to the scientific community, this is something that the ancients across the world had already discovered. We just would not listen. Had already discovered. So, in what ways did the ancients, who seemed to know things before we do, utilize magnetism, and indeed, electromagnetism? It is claimed by New Age healers, utilize magnetism, and indeed, electromagnetism? That quartz crystal holds energy, and therefore they say, also information in a binary form. Is this true? It is. Do crystals hold energy that could be related to information? Definitely. That could be related to information? But what kind of energy? Anthropological. But what kind of energy? Any consciously programmed information and records of any kind. Would this information be as old as the crystal? And records of any kind. Yes, and there could be new programming as well. Doctor Gebbe at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Laboratories in the United States, stated, Doctor Gebbe at the National Institute of Standards "All matter contains energy. "Why should crystals be any different? "I also know that within crystals, like all matter, "Why should crystals be any different? "there are negatively charged electrons, "and positively charged protons. "Since a force of some sort keeps them apart, "despite their natural tendencies to attract each other, "Since a force of some sort keeps them apart, "I can attribute to an internal energy, "and one precisely described by quantum mechanics, as well. "The force within the crystal is balanced by energy, "called, a force of some sort. "The light from these crystals was indeed real, "but it was more than that. "The light from these crystals was indeed real, "It was also real on another level, "and the crystals helped the adept generate an inner light." Crystals across the world, have been used by shaman, "and the crystals helped the adept generate an inner light." and others to induce or connect with the other world. This other world is the place where people connect and others to induce or connect with the other world. With aliens, angels, and any number of other names mankind has given them over millennia. With aliens, angels, and any number There are crystals that have entered into culture, and become almost overnight enigmas. The Crystal Skulls. In "The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls," by Chris Morton and Ceri Louise Thomas, we find the story of the Crystal Skull phenomena, that the establishments seem to ignore. We find the story of the Crystal Skull phenomena, At the beginning of the book, we are introduced to what is known as, the Mitchell-Hedges Skull, or Skull of Doom. This is probably the most famous of all crystal skulls, and has been seen on numerous occasions on television, and elsewhere. It is a clear quartz crystal skull, perfectly human in appearance, with two holes beneath. It is made from one complete quartz crystal rock, and has some peculiar properties. It is made from one complete quartz crystal rock, To quote from the book, "The prismatic qualities of the crystal are such "that if the sun's rays are very strong, "and fall at a particular angle onto the back of the skull, "that if the sun's rays are very strong, "they are focused and condensed, "and appear as a bright, sharp, beam of light, "out of the skull's eyes, nose, and mouth." "and appear as a bright, sharp, beam of light, The shining ones, beings of light, and serpent deities of the ancients were all featured as having shining, or bright eyes. And serpent deities of the ancients Could this have been a coincidence? In legend and myth, these cross-associations with bright eyes and even serpents, eventually seems to have come through into Egypt, with bright eyes and even serpents, as the uzait or uraeus snake, which adorned the brow of the Pharaohs. The terms, uzait or uraeus, mean simply, the eye, and shows the bright, swift, powerful nature of the serpent energy. In Europe, the infamous god Balder was said to be the most beautiful of gods. He was pure radiance and light. He shown. It was said that his snowy brow, He shown. Or the place where the Egyptian uraeus would be, radiated beams of pure sunlight, which gladdened the hearts of men. In Greece, Zeus, the greatest of gods, had shining eyes, which gladdened the hearts of men. Which turned every way, and dealt good fortune and bad. In India, the son of Truth had shining eyes, and both the serpent-associated deities, Bacchus and Dionysus, of the Romans and the Greeks, and both the serpent-associated deities, had bright and shining eyes. In Egypt we find that the father of all, Ptah, had shining eyes, as did Noah, In Egypt we find that the father of all, Ptah, and in Daniel, we hear of eyes as lamps of fire, much like in Revelation, where his eyes were as a flame of fire. We find later on, in folklore, than many giants have shining, or burning, eyes. We find later on, in folklore, These giants are the remnants of the Watchers from the Bible, who were original shining ones, and were the original aliens that came through to Earth, created civilization, and aided in the construction of great structures. This is what the ancient texts actually tell us. Watchers, Shining Ones, angels, and more, This is what the ancient texts actually tell us. Are all extraterrestrial beings of light. They are pure energy information. So in myth, legend, and fable, we can find all of the relevant deities and characters, with shining eyes. We can find all of the relevant deities and characters, Could this similarity across so many gods, and right through to this crystal skull, with its physical shining eyes, be a coincidence? Let us see if there are further clues with its physical shining eyes, be a coincidence? To the truth behind the crystal skulls, and if there is any relationship between the skull and the trance state of the shining experience. And if there is any relationship between the skull The skull was said by the owner, Anna Mitchell-Hedges, to have come into her possession The skull was said by the owner, Anna Mitchell-Hedges, when she was on a dig with her father at Lubaantun in the 1920's, when she was on a dig with her father and was therefore believed to be Mayan. Hewlett-Packard believed it would have taken and was therefore believed to be Mayan. 300 years to make the skull using conventional means, unless of course, our ancestors 300 years to make the skull using conventional means, had technology we have not yet discovered. In the myths of the Mayans, the shaman, had technology we have not yet discovered. When coming to the end of his life, would need to pass on information to the next shaman. When coming to the end of his life, In order to facilitate this, the aging shaman would place his hand on the crystal skull, and impart the energy information into the skull, just like the laying on of hands. Next, the new shaman would follow suit, just like the laying on of hands. But this time upload the information directly, through his hand into his brain. Strange how the hand is on the same frequency as the brain. In this way, the knowledge of the whole lineage of shaman, Strange how the hand is on the same frequency as the brain. Would be passed on via the skull, which itself is said to hold the knowledge of the Universe, just as our para-scientists had suggested. All of this sounded too bizarre to be real. However, we have already learned that the human body is highly capable of receiving huge amounts of information that we are not conscious of. And, we have already learned that the Universe sent out information all at the same time everywhere. We also know that the ancients understood about the magnification of energy, the same energy some believe to impart information. About the magnification of energy, Could it be that this information is somehow held within the quartz crystal Could it be that this information of this skull and others? And that it could somehow be extracted by a qualified adept. And that it could somehow be extracted We turn now to quantum entanglement. Scientists from Beijing, We turn now to quantum entanglement. To the Hungarian Institute for Science, and Stanford in the US, and elsewhere, have been working on the quantum entanglement theory for some time. Have been working on the quantum entanglement theory The Stanford Education website gives us the following explanation of the theory. "Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, "like energy, associated with the peculiar nonclassical "Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, "correlations that are possible "between separated quantum systems. "Entanglement can be measured, transformed, and purified. "between separated quantum systems. "A pair of quantum systems in an entangled state "can be used as a quantum information channel "to perform computational and cryptographic tasks "can be used as a quantum information channel "that are impossible for classical systems." So, through quantum entanglement, which is like energy, two separate systems can be measured, transformed, So, through quantum entanglement, which is like energy, and even, like the ancient statements of mystics from across the world, be purified. It is a method of information exchange that is nonclassical, that is, not as we generally understand. In one scientific test, not as we generally understand. Which has been described as a landmark experiment, scientists put two people into separate rooms, and connected them up to the scientific apparatus, scientists put two people into separate rooms, such as electrodes. One person is flashed 100 times with a bright light, while the other person's reactions are being monitored. Amazingly, the initial results showed beyond doubt, that the emotion of the flashing lights had transferred into the other chamber that the emotion of the flashing lights and into the mind of the second person. In 1965, two pairs of identical twins under observation, were found to be quantum entangled, too. As one twin closed their eye, were found to be quantum entangled, too. The alpha waves in the brain were stimulated, and amazingly, this same stimulation of the alpha waves was noted at exactly the same time in the opposite twin. And amazingly, this same stimulation of the alpha waves Scientists have said that the effect has brought about via quantum entanglement, and they are even now researching via quantum entanglement, how this amazing particle effect can be used in communication devices and computers. It is a complex science, can be used in communication devices and computers. And recently scientists actually photographed particles entangling for the very first time, proving the existence of quantum entanglement beyond doubt. Entangling for the very first time, So, we know that via the modern discovery of the perfectly scientific quantum entanglement, So, we know that via the modern discovery humans were capable of sending and receiving some form of information, human to human, or even human to alien. Now, with the added evidence of human sensors and receptors, let alone crystal magnification, and ordering of energy information, let alone crystal magnification, it is starting to look perfectly possible. Added to this, the evidence that crystals could actually hold energy and information, and that the resonant frequencies were similar to our own, could actually hold energy and information, when in the trance state. We are slowly coming around to the idea that this may indeed be possible. The Mitchell-Hedges Skull had been tested by Hewlett-Packard in the 1970's, which show that the skull was piezoelectric, a kind of quartz used today in modern electronics, which show that the skull was piezoelectric, and quantum computing. Piezo is a Greek word, which means to squeeze, and electro means simply, to get electricity from. Therefore the term, piezoelectric, simply means that it will produce electric current if squeezed. This is due to an inherent silicon dioxide, found within the quartz crystal, which gives a negative and positive polarity, found within the quartz crystal, which in the case of the Mitchell-Hedges Skull, runs vertically like a battery, or indeed like our own spine. Applying electricity to such a substance actually makes it change shape. The two holes found beneath the skull are therefore some kind of battery antenna. It was in fact connected to something else now lost. Hewlett-Packard found that light entering the skull, not only passes upon the optical axis, Hewlett-Packard found that light entering the skull, but also rotates as it travels, like a serpent running up a pole. This crystal skull was actually shown to hold an amazing electrical energy, but more than that, it actually controlled to hold an amazing electrical energy, the oscillation at a constant frequency. Now, across the world, there are literally thousands if not millions of individuals who actually believe this skull to be a device to enter the other world, a world occupied by the minds of the ancients, and beings of the other world. A world occupied by the minds of the ancients, Is is therefore an ancient knowledge bank, or direct route to the infamous Akashic records. In other words, more grounded. Could this and other crystals be ancient computer-like storage devices, Could this and other crystals which utilizes the natural electrical and magnetic energy within, to store information that can be retrieved electrical and magnetic energy within, by the receptors that scientists are today admitting exist, or even a route to revealing the source center of existence. The chances seem to be stacking up in favor or even a route to revealing the source center of existence. Of either of these assumptions. To quote from Morton and Thomas' book, "When we come in contact "with a piezoelectric quartz crystal, "When we come in contact "such as the Crystal Skull, "the electromagnetic energy waves we produce "are received by the quartz. "The crystal then starts oscillating "and amplifying these signals, "and rebroadcast them in modified form "back into the atmosphere, "and rebroadcast them in modified form "where they are picked up again by the cells of the body. "In effect, the quartz crystal modifies and amplifies "our own electromagnetic waves, "In effect, the quartz crystal modifies and amplifies "and relays them back to us." So, in the process these waves of energy information become stronger and clearer. So, in the process these waves of energy information As we had just discovered, raw piezoelectric quartz is certainly renowned as a natural electronic oscillator, or resonator, or amplifier. Is certainly renowned as a natural electronic oscillator, This oscillational resonance is perfectly in tune with the frequencies of the human body, and indeed, the Earth. It seems then that the knowledge of the ancients could very well be held within the ancient crystal artifacts of the globe, or even that they magnify the quasi-quantum vacuum field, within the ancient crystal artifacts of the globe, where the information is stored, and all the time it is being ignored or hidden by modern science, but science at least helps us to understand how this effect is possible. It seems that the now-infamous pineal gland how this effect is possible. Is responsible for the receptive side of this amazing feat of nature, with its in-built magnetite, or ion oxide, of this amazing feat of nature, the pineal organ is responsible in birds for location finding, just as it is in us. The magnetite in the gland picks up the supposedly subtle for location finding, just as it is in us. Electromagnetic current of the Earth, and gives the subconscious brain a location and bearing. This in itself links to the peculiar head shaping and gives the subconscious brain a location and bearing. Seen in ancient times, known as trip-hanging. In Mesoamerica, archeologists have discovered the particular shaping of heads to affect the sloping brow, the particular shaping of heads via tying planks of wood to the head, from birth. This is has the effect of flattening out the pineal organ, to be even more receptive, like a satellite dish. This is has the effect of flattening out the pineal organ, No wonder that these strange-headed people from across the world were called, Shining Ones and Serpent Deities. From across the world were called, They were in fact in touch with the other world, or ancient knowledge system. Wise, all-knowing beings of light from another world. Amazing, all of this relates to the greatest mysteries, Wise, all-knowing beings of light from another world. The Great Pyramid. Right now you are probably wondering the Great Pyramid. How any of this can relate to the Great Pyramid in Giza. The pyramid was once known as the gateway, and you may now realize where this is leading. The pyramid was once known as the gateway, Morton and Thomas had already pointed out in their book, that the infamous Teotihuacan temple complex, was in the same layout as the pyramid complex at Giza. The Orion correlation theory, the is where two pyramids are in line, with a third slightly off, just like Orion's Belt in the sky. Why this should be seen in Egypt and South America, nobody knows. Why this should be seen However, the ancient priesthood, known as the Shining Ones, were responsible for many of the similarities seen around the world, because they traveled extensively. Were responsible for many of the similarities These same Shining Ones, were the adepts of the trance, and it would be therefore, these same people who developed the use of crystals, as an aid to the deeper knowledge gained through the bio-electromagnetic energy information system. These Shining Ones claimed energy information system. To have gained their special knowledge from their brethren, the beings of light from the other world. The Aztecs and Mayans, amongst others, believed strongly that the priests The Aztecs and Mayans, amongst others, held their secrets within the mountains, meaning pyramids, and of course the other world womb, which is nothing other than the other world itself. Meaning pyramids, and of course the other world womb, The word pyramid means 'fire in the middle, ' or 'fire mountain.' This of course would be an allusion to the fire of trance. In fact, the pyramid was a superconductor of electromagnetic energy, which synchronized with our human resonance, and aided the oncoming of a trance state. It boosted the internal enlightenment, and connection to the other world. But, what was different here and now, and connection to the other world. Was that it was looking like it could also be a gateway to ancient information, held possibly in or via the crystal, be a gateway to ancient information, and more importantly here, quartz. Above the king's chamber is a layer of granite blocks, brought hundreds of miles to this particular site. Above the king's chamber is a layer of granite blocks, The majority of the pyramid is limestone, this is important. Limestone is made up of calcium and magnesium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is electromagnetically anisotropic, it is an excellent receiver of electromagnetic waves. Strangely, it also becomes luminescent when rubbed, giving rise the phrase, 'limelight.' Strangely, it also becomes luminescent when rubbed, The majority of granite is made up of quartz, which we have found to be piezoelectric, and is an excellent converter of electromagnetic waves. Basically, by putting large granite blocks above the king's chamber, in became in fact Basically, by putting large granite blocks a massive crystal skull-type receiver. It could also be conjectured, that it would transmit information as well, given sufficient energy resources, such as making loud noises. Given sufficient energy resources, The Great Pyramid as a crystal skull, could theoretically receive information, but from where? It is an established fact that pyramids and temples in South America were fashioned to enable the carrying of sound waves. For instance, at Tulum in the Yucatan, were fashioned to enable the carrying of sound waves. The temple gives a crystal clear whistle or howl, when the wind blows through it, a sound that is magnified. When the wind blows through it, At Tikal, the Mayan temple pyramid shows a clear projection of sound as the speaker from the top of the pyramid can be heard from great distances. The same is true at various other temples. These sounds are waves, and structures have been created by these ancient people to carry these waves over long distances. And structures have been created by these ancient people Adding to that, these sound waves were more than just mere noises. These were special ritualized and deeply religious sounds being carried across the expanse. These were special ritualized and deeply religious sounds Could it not be possible that they could have created also a device, such as the great and notably central pyramid in Egypt to be a massive communication device of ritualized internally esoteric and religious information to be a massive communication device of ritualized from the other world? There are yet more strange coincidences however, regarding quartz and the pyramid. There are yet more strange coincidences however, Quartz grows in a particular geometric pattern, as do all crystals. In this instance though, as do all crystals. Quartz grows in the form of a triangle, or pyramid, with an angle of 51.43 degrees, the same as the outer walls of the Great Pyramid. Could this too be a coincidence? Or were the ancients matching the angles of this great communicating crystal? Amazingly, this very angle is a natural angle that can be created with the use of a circle and a line. It was the method used by architects of sacred geometrical buildings, It was the method used by architects to square the circle, and it produced an almost 52 degree. Man, it seems discovered, or was given these wondrous and incredible natural mathematical phenomena, and made them real and physical. If there were going to be any physical construction that would aid the quantum communication that we in the modern age have neglected, then it would have a magnificent mathematical pattern. Quartz crystal begins its life deep within the Earth then it would have a magnificent mathematical pattern. From hot vapor, which is a supersaturated solution of silicon dioxide. As it cools, a unit cell of quartz forms around a nucleated seed, As it cools, a unit cell of quartz forms in the same way that an oyster forms. It is a matrix created around a seed point. The forming atoms and bonding are laid down where there is most energy, the molecules adhering to the base silicon matrix. Made up as a tetrahedron-shaped molecule, it now composed of four atoms of oxygen, with one silicon atom suspended within. It now composed of four atoms of oxygen, This primary cell unit now attracts other silicon dioxide molecules, and, over time, trillions of these cells link together in a spiraling motion, and, over time, trillions of these cells layer upon layer, until the crystal is made. The crystal is a known quantum converter that is able to transmit energy in a magnified state, and this energy can easily be absorbed or received by biological matter, and this energy can easily be absorbed such as the human body. So, in conclusion, the crystal is formed via a serpentine spiraling motion, and as a known quantum converter, transmitting energy information at a magnified rate. Simply amazing. So, that is a little standard science behind quartz, but is there any more scientific information that relates to our study? An article that appeared in "Nature" magazine in January, 2002, by Philip Ball entitled, "Solid Stops Light," in "Nature" magazine in January, 2002, has the answer. Ball shows how scientists had managed to bring light to a complete standstill inside a crystal. Apparently, the trick could be used to store information in a quantum computer. Now, thousands of years later, in a quantum computer. Modern man is using crystals to create quantum computers. Our ancestors got there first. Quartz crystal is made up lattice work of silicon, and oxygen atoms, which surround a relatively open space. It is this open space that can be compressed, or squeezed, which surround a relatively open space. And expanded with certain stimuli. This same stimulus also makes the crystal vibrate or sing. These vibrations make waves, This same stimulus also makes the crystal vibrate or sing. Which human receptors pick up, and convert back to binary information. Which human receptors pick up, This means that vibratory information of energy of different frequencies, can be stored, This means that vibratory information of energy like the light that came to a standstill inside the empty space. Like the light that came to a standstill These crystals do much more though. They also amplify the energy like temples magnifying sound, by moving them, applying pressure, or other stimuli, such as touch, these crystals can be forced to offer up their in-held information energy, these crystals can be forced to offer up or possibly that of the holographic universe to which all things are connected, or possibly that of the holographic universe including the wave particles within the crystal. Marcel Vogel, a scientist working on computer chips, noticed while observing certain liquid crystals Marcel Vogel, a scientist working on computer chips, through a high-powered microscope, that when he projected certain thoughts into the liquid, just before it turned to solid, it would shape itself into the approximate shape of his visualized thoughts. Indeed, he has even stated his belief that these quartz chips be programmed by the mind alone. As in fact, thoughts are simply energy waves in themselves. That these quartz chips be programmed by the mind alone. If these crystals could read the mind of a scientist in such a way, surely they can also read the mind of one who was an adept, of a scientist in such a way, and who had a large or malformed pineal organ, such as those serpent people of South America, Malta, and elsewhere. The difficulty for ordinary people, we are told, Malta, and elsewhere. Is that we cannot focus sufficiently well, or for long enough. Western metaphysical beliefs actually state or for long enough. That when the thalamus gland is stimulated, the subconscious seems to yield more information, and according to many psychics, it is the aid of the crystal, or indeed the magnifying effect of the pyramid, which makes it possible for this energy information or indeed the magnifying effect of the pyramid, to be picked up by ordinary people. But the pyramid and the crystals were there simply for the adepts, who had already trained extensively for the process. This history relates to us that crystals are to be found in the correct context in alchemy, witchcraft, and general magic, as well as being discovered witchcraft, and general magic, at various prehistoric sites around the world, in ritualistic locations or contexts. The Indians of both North and South America are intricately linked through culture and history. They had their own belief in the life that resides in the crystal. To them, the spirits held within the crystal can materialize and become visible, and some even feed the crystal's liquids. These spirits within the crystals are the beings of light or aliens being seen by adepts, These spirits within the crystals through these amazing communication devices. These forms may be what are known as bio-photons through these amazing communication devices. That are being magnified by the crystal, or alternatively, they could be that are being magnified by the crystal, electromagnetic energy waves seen by adepts who are drug-induced, or in a meditative state. Seen by adepts who are drug-induced, In fact, a certain Harry Oldfield in Middlesex, England, discovered something quite amazing when using a Kirlian photography technique. Discovered something quite amazing Kirlian photography measures electromagnetic energy emitted by a given body, and through it, alternative medical practitioners emitted by a given body, are able to see negative points in the body, which need help. These negatives come up as different colors on the photograph, and the practitioner can then use crystals or other tools to balance out the energy. And the practitioner can then use crystals At least that's the claim. It has goes the claim, been an extremely effective tool in the medical armory, even though orthodox medicine derides its use. Been an extremely effective tool in the medical armory, Some doctors even within the orthodox world, however, do sign up to its methods, while others are enthusiastic individuals who recognize its importance. One day, when using Kirlian photography on a female patient who was holding a crystal, One day, when using Kirlian photography Oldfield, a teacher, later noticed a white serpent shape emerging from the crystal. Although Oldfield insists on calling this peculiar phenomenon, which he has many images of now, an entity. It may be that this is purely the serpentine energy wave of electromagnetism seen here visually, It may be that this is purely the serpentine energy wave as the shaman of the world claim to be able to see it. Another interesting effect of holding a crystal while using Kirlian photography, is that the subtle energy field of the body is doubled. Marcel Vogel also found that crystals affected the molecular structure of water. Marcel Vogel also found that crystals If we move this slightly, we find that over 70% of our own body is made up of water. If we move this slightly, So crystals could indeed have even more profound effect upon our body than previously thought. If we also take into consideration that some believe the coffer in the Great Pyramid was a flotation tank, or that the chambers above, created by the granite blocks, contained water. Then we can see how an extra magnification effect created by the granite blocks, contained water. May have been taking place. It seems the beauty of the crystal may have been taking place. Is in its innate regulatory effects, and ability to hold information in order. This order is thought therefore to aid the balancing and order of the human subtle energy, collecting the energy, and magnifying it back in a balanced state. In fact, the Earth is thought to be made up of 40% quartz crystal, In fact, the Earth is thought to be made up and maybe an aid to the thermodynamic balance we exist in, on the macro scale. The Great Pyramid in fact, has all of these fundamental constituent parts, such as water, quartz, and limestone. There are in fact many claims made about pyramids, such as the aid concentration, There are in fact many claims made about pyramids, heightened psychic energy, sharpened razors, purify water, aid in the mummification process, keep foods fresh, increase the growth rate of plants, and promote healing. There is an ancient structural Hindu design, which dates back to 3,000 BC, supposedly before the building of the Great Pyramid, which dates back to 3,000 BC, called a Shri Yantra. This amazing image is both two-dimensional, and three-dimensional, and can be a drawn mandala, or a building. It incorporates just about every geometric pattern possible. But most amazing, is the fact that the base angle of the Shri Yantra, But most amazing, is the fact is 51.5032 degrees, virtually the same as the Great Pyramid, and the triangular structure of the quarts crystal. The idea of the Shri Yantra, is to balance and clear the negative energy, that is in us and around us, whether we meditate upon the form, that is in us and around us, or actually stand within it. The term simply means, 'wealth bringer, ' and is a reference to the fact that in China and India, The term simply means, 'wealth bringer, ' it was used by the elite to bring good luck and prosperity, and is also linked to the goddess Lakshmi, who's also the goddess of wealth. Today, Shri Yantras are produced in quartz crystal, as it is believed that this doubles the power of the shape, and the crystal. Obviously, nobody has scientifically tested the results, the power of the shape, and the crystal. But Kirlian photography has shown an incredible aura. What else did the ancients really know? But Kirlian photography has shown an incredible aura. And how did they discover the secrets? They understood that they could use their natural tools to communicate information, and to heal the sick. They understood and were closer to nature than we can possibly imagine. We should therefore give them the respect than we can possibly imagine. Their ancient knowledge deserves, and not close our orthodox eyes to the possibilities that are now open to us. But to come to a true conclusion, that are now open to us. We have to revisit the Great Pyramid, because it truly holds the secrets of history. We have to revisit the Great Pyramid, According to the standard orthodox Egyptology, the pyramid complex on Giza plateau are funerary structures of the three Pharaohs the pyramid complex on Giza plateau from the 4th Dynasty, approximately 2575 to 2465 BC. However, author Miroslav Werner, writing in "The Pyramids," stated, "To suppose that the pyramids' "only function in ancient Egypt "was as a royal tomb, would be an oversimplification. "This is now more true than ever, "was as a royal tomb, would be an oversimplification. "and if the Great Pyramid was built solely "for burial purposes of a given King Khufu, "then it was and will remain an unprecedented farce. "It is simply unimaginable "that so much effort be placed into building a structure "It is simply unimaginable "of such gargantuan proportions, "with such amazing astronomical alignments, "with such perfect precision, by thousands of human souls, "all for the one purpose of burying their god king. "In all the pyramids in Egypt, "all for the one purpose of burying their god king. "not one has delivered the full body of a Pharaoh. "There have been parts, a supposed mummified foot at Josa, "fragments of a mummy in the pyramid of Unas and Pepi, "an arm and shoulder at Teti, "and a skeleton of a young woman "an arm and shoulder at Teti, "in the coffer of the pyramid of Menkaure, "but never a full mummified body of a Pharaoh, "in the coffer of the pyramid of Menkaure, "that was supposed to be buried within." The Egyptologists claimed that this was due to the tombs having been raided over the vast period of time. To the tombs having been raided This may be true, but alternatively, it may be that the pyramids were used for other purposes, as well, or instead of. These body parts discovered within the pyramids, may be Pharaonic remains, but they could just easily be more modern burials, placed within the pyramids at a later date. A similar thing is found in the burial mounds of Europe and elsewhere. Here, the burial mounds, as sacred images of the primordial mound, Here, the burial mounds, or world mountain, were gateways to the other world. And for centuries, progressive generations would cut into them and make fresh burials. This did not take away the purpose or meaning of the mounds, as gateways to the other world. This did not take away the purpose or meaning of the mounds, In fact, this use utilized the main purpose. Were these great feats of human ingenuity and skill just for the purpose of encasing the carcass of one man? No, in fact, if they were built for just one man, just for the purpose of encasing the carcass of one man? Then why did Amenemhat III have two pyramids built, one at Dahshur, which contained his granite coffer, and one at Hawara, with quartzite coffer? One at Dahshur, which contained his granite coffer, The one unifying element of these two pyramids, was the materials used for the coffers, granite and quartz, which as we have seen are highly important was the materials used for the coffers, granite and quartz, to the whole gateway scenario. It is claimed that one of these was a cenotaph, to the whole gateway scenario. Which comes from the Greek, cenotaphium, meaning, empty tomb. Which comes from the Greek, cenotaphium, Of course, this is even more remarkable that a tomb should be built empty, and the reason given by Egyptologists is simply, that it would confuse the tomb raiders. And the reason given by Egyptologists is simply, The only so-called evidence that the Great Pyramid was built for Khufu, is scant to say the least. Herodotus, the infamous Roman historian, visited the pyramids in 443 BC, Herodotus, the infamous Roman historian, and claimed that Khufu was buried underneath the pyramid, not in it. This was 2,000 years after the supposed event. Underneath the pyramid, not in it. We simply cannot trust what we read today in our newspapers, let alone believe Herodotus, We simply cannot trust what we read today in our newspapers, and his interpretation of what he was led to believe. The next piece of evidence is extremely controversial, as it relies upon some difficult to see, let alone decipher, inscriptions on a funerary complex near the Great Pyramid, claiming to be, in the time of Khufu. Near the Great Pyramid, Again, and lastly, in the pyramid itself, the hieroglyphic symbol for Khufu himself, as a quarry mark, was discovered by archeologist, Richard Howard Vyse, who is now believed to have forged it, under pressure of competition from contemporary foreign archeologists, mainly the Italian, Caviglia. From contemporary foreign archeologists, So, we are left with an inscription near the pyramid, a fake hieroglyphic, So, we are left with an inscription near the pyramid, and two and a half thousand year old text, based upon hearsay. This is hardly evidence for it to be based upon hearsay. The burial place of Khufu, let alone for anything else. Although it is perfectly possible let alone for anything else. That Khufu was buried at this special place, and that later a pyramid was constructed, the pyramid however remains an enigma, regardless of what we are led to believe. This unproven nonsense has pervaded Egyptology ever since, regardless of what we are led to believe. Regardless of any other reason for the existence of the pyramids. Now, we know the other reason. The Great Pyramid of Giza is to be found at the center of the Earth's land mass. It is 30 degrees north, 31 degrees east, is to be found at the center of the Earth's land mass. Central both north-south, and east-west. It is in the perfect location, at the center, central both north-south, and east-west. For collecting the Earth energy and magnifying it. To add to this, the two materials used were also perfect, but first we need to take a foray To add to this, the two materials used were also perfect, into the world of Tesla, to understand more. Nikola Tesla was an eccentric and brilliant inventor, who managed to harness the alternating current we use today, as well as radio, fluorescent lighting, and much more. Tesla believed he could send waves of electricity directly to our homes through the Earth and air, without the use of wires, and without harming anybody along the way, by simply applying a subtle push-pull resonator. And without harming anybody along the way, In 1901, Tesla said, "My next step was to use the Earth itself In 1901, Tesla said, "as the medium for conducting the currents." And he did. "as the medium for conducting the currents." Tesla successfully sent electricity 26 miles, and extracted it using a magnifying receiver. This is an incredible thought that energy waves, even extremely low frequency waves, could be sent around the globe, and then with a magnifying receiver, they could be picked up and understood or used. In fact, Tesla even tuned they could be picked up and understood or used. In his pyramid-shaped magnifying transmitter to the resonance of the Earth, and found that his coworkers were becoming ill to the resonance of the Earth, with symptoms of extreme tensions of the nerves. Tesla discovered that the Earth with symptoms of extreme tensions of the nerves. Was bound to be literally alive with electrical vibrations, and soon, I was deeply absorbed in this interesting investigation. Tesla continued, and revealed his feelings. "My first observations positively terrified me, "as there was present in them something mysterious, "not to say, supernatural." He said, "It was some time afterward, "when the thought flashed upon my mind, He said, "It was some time afterward, "that the disturbances I had observed, "might be do to an intelligent control." "that the disturbances I had observed, It would be many years later that Schumann would discover the resonance of the Earth, and prove that it had its own wave-particle pattern, and that it can be altered by the surrounding universe, the collective super-consciousness, and any number of other external influences. The collective super-consciousness, How does it do this? The chaotic beginnings of the Big Bang are still very much in the realms of theory, and there is another theory which goes that the universe is a standing wave being pushed and pulled by some impulse such as thought. This impulse, like our thoughts, being pushed and pulled by some impulse such as thought. Which seem to create wave particles, pushes and pulls the standing wave, which seem to create wave particles, which then does the same to its neighbor. And hey, presto, light can travel across the universe, which then does the same to its neighbor. As a wave cascade, without loss of energy, a perpetual motion. As a wave cascade, without loss of energy, Our thoughts affect a surrounding standing wave in no different manner. Maybe what Tesla had discovered in these vibrations that were disturbances, Maybe what Tesla had discovered in these vibrations and seemed to have intelligent control, were really the living wave matter particles of us, all pushing at the boundaries of an expanding universe. Billions of thoughts creating energy, push and pull. Tesla had discovered intelligent signals Billions of thoughts creating energy, push and pull. By pure accident, and stated the case. Unfortunately, through circumstances outside of his own control, Unfortunately, through circumstances he never did get around to seriously working on the phenomena, and nobody since him, has had the intelligence, or will, to seriously working on the phenomena, to see the issue through. What Tesla discovered, however, was found within the ELF field, What Tesla discovered, however, the low frequency bandwidths. Many people are out there, not least of whom are SETI, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, looking on the megahertz level, the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, when they should be redirecting their search back down to Earth, and to the extremely low frequency, before the mobile phone masks completely engulf us. Tesla's receivers were great towers with pyramids on top. And Tesla's insistence that to be at the center of the landmass, would be far more beneficial to the purpose of the machinery. So, Tesla discovered the resonance of the Earth, and that the resonance had intelligent attributes. So, Tesla discovered the resonance of the Earth, The resonance of the Earth, is in the same 0.40 hertz as the human mind. The resonance of the Earth, The same mind, which is constantly emitting signals into the environment around it. The same mind, which is constantly emitting signals These signals are much more than just waves, they are also particles, they are therefore matter. We see stars in the sky, little lights flickering, billions of light years away. Many of these lights are no longer there. They are stars that have died, and yet we still see the light. This light, we know now to be wave matter particle, we know it is the continued life of that star. We, ourselves, as part and parcel of the whole universal constants, We, ourselves, as part and parcel and laws of chaos and order are nothing different to those stars. We are also putting out signals, are nothing different to those stars. Which will continue as wave matter particles, even after we have died. These signals are ELF signals, and are caught up within the Schumann resonance, 60 kilometers above the Earth, and creating a hole. Are these signals of our spirits? Are these the signals, we ourselves are placing into the great Akashic collective super-consciousness? Are the beings of light, a great many people see, and call alien and angel, really living wave particle memories of ancients? Do these wave particles that Tesla discovered, represent the sum of mankind, Do these wave particles that Tesla discovered, and indeed, all life on Earth? Is Gaia, the Mother Earth, truly alive, and conscious, as the collective mind? Amazingly, Tesla described these electromagnetic signals and conscious, as the collective mind? As stationary parallel circles, forming on the surface of the Earth. As stationary parallel circles, These are no different to the circles mankind has been perceiving, and materializing here on the Earth, for thousands of years, as stone circles, rock art, and all manner of mysterious artifacts. As stone circles, rock art, And where would the most powerful collective electromagnetic current collect, And where would the most powerful other than at the center of the landmass? As the great and mystical saying, OM turns from a circle into a square, As the great and mystical saying, as it reaches M. So too, this great collection of human thought, and quantum emotion, So too, this great collection of human thought, turns into a square base, at the Great Pyramid in Giza. So, the Great Pyramid at the center of the Earth's landmass, and as a perfect shape for receiving So, the Great Pyramid at the center of the Earth's landmass, the resonance of the Earth, simply must have a better reason for existing, the resonance of the Earth, than as a large coffin for one man. Let's break it all down, and move through the various elements, one piece at at time. The Great Pyramid is made up of mainly solid mass, with the interior spaces being the descending and ascending passages. The grand gallery, a subterranean chamber, another chamber unnamed, and the king and queen's chambers. Another chamber unnamed, The King's Chambers, was so named by Arabs who attempted to raid the tomb, but found it empty. It is 10.46 meters east to west, 5.23 meters north to south, and 5.81 meters high. 5.23 meters north to south, This is an architectural three-dimensional representation of the golden mean, or phi, This is an architectural three-dimensional representation a sacred geometry well before Pythagoras. The sides of the Great Pyramid line up almost exactly with the cardinal points on the compass, with an accuracy that would defy today's builders, leaving a fifth point on top. The dimensions of the Earth's size and shape can be calculated using the dimensions of the pyramid, The dimensions of the Earth's size and shape it being a scale model of the hemisphere, with information on the latitude and longitude of the Earth. The very foundations of the pyramid with information on the latitude and longitude of the Earth. Also defy modern building techniques, as it rests perfectly level, also defy modern building techniques, with not one corner of the base more than 13 millimeters higher or lower than the others. When we remember that the base covers 13 acres, we can suddenly understand just how this was When we remember that the base covers 13 acres, an incredible feat of human engineering, if indeed its construction was not in fact an incredible feat of human engineering, aided by the beings of light. The King's Chamber is made up of solid red granite, transported from the quarries of the Aswan, 600 miles away. There has to be a better reason for the ancient Egyptians to have undertook such a task, transporting at least 50 tons of red granite, for such a huge distance, than simply to line a chamber. For such a huge distance, Well, we have already discussed the unique properties of granite, and so, we should be able to now grasp the unique properties of granite, the importance of this material. However, there were more interesting uses of granite in the pyramid. In the chamber itself there is a coffer thought by egyptologists to be the remains of Khufu's sarcophagus. Thought by egyptologists to be the remains Nothing was ever found in the coffer. Neither was there a lid. Nothing was ever found in the coffer. It is too big to take out the corridor leading to and from it, indicating that it must have been laid inside leading to and from it, as the building was erected around it, which is opposite to the funerary custom of the period. There is not the slightest piece of evidence to suggest that Khufu be ever laid to rest in this three ton granite container. There is nothing, not even any funerary implements, in this three ton granite container. Or embalming materials, not a scrap. And yet, short of any other ideas, the orthodox situation remains that a building with 2.3 million blocks, the orthodox situation remains weighing between 2.5 and 50 tons each, of perfect size and orientation, was built for one man to be buried within. Of perfect size and orientation, To add to this, not one of the 4th Dynasty Pharaohs put their names upon the pyramids supposedly built for them, whereas, from the 5th Dynasty onwards, official inscriptions are in the thousands. So what is the truth of the Great Pyramid? There are legends and traditions that claim The King's Chamber to be a place of initiation. There are also many stories of individuals that claim The King's Chamber to be a place of initiation. Who felt peculiar presences, or had mystical experiences within the chamber. There is also the tradition that Napoleon himself actually refused to express what happened to him in that enigmatic place, saying, "You would not believe me if I told you." in that enigmatic place, According to these modern popular folktales, the coffer itself is the center of the process or energy vortex. Writer, C Dunn, in his book, or energy vortex. "The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt," goes so far as to say the Great Pyramid was a huge geo-mechanical power plant, goes so far as to say the Great Pyramid that responds to the Earth's vibrations, or resonance, and transforms it into energy. Dunn conjectured that the geometric and physical design of the chamber inside the pyramid turned it into a large transducer, and physical design of the chamber inside the pyramid and has produced a highly scientific analysis of the subject. So there is now scientific experimentation behind these folktales, as we shall see, So there is now scientific experimentation but with a very different purpose. In the 1920's, Antoine Bovis discovered but with a very different purpose. That the heat and humidity of the King's Chamber reduced the decay rate of dead animals. Bovis went on to construct a small-scale pyramid, and oriented it in the same fashion. He placed a dead cat inside, and oriented it in the same fashion. And found the result to be the same. Following this in the 1960's, US and Czech researchers repeated the process Following this in the 1960's, and achieved the same results. In the ancient Egyptian language of Kamitia, the pyramid was known as proneta, which can be translated in two ways, the pyramid was known as proneta, house of nature, or more importantly, the house of energy, remarkably, like pyramid, which means 'fire in the middle.' the house of energy, it is interesting of course to note that nature and energy are interchangeable in this way, indicating that the Kamitians truly saw energy as from nature itself, not to mention that the word 'neder' also mean 'neutral, ' which is the position one has to be in not to mention that the word 'neder' also mean 'neutral, ' to gain entry into the other world. Another title of course for the Giza area, is Rastal, which means gateway, and is sacred to Osiris and his progenitor Sokar, the god of the underworld. In the book of Am Duet, the god of the underworld. Sokar inhabits a place of the dead, that even Ra, the sun god, cannot access. This is therefore a place of darkness. According to Reginald Aubrey Fessenden, author of "The Deluged Civilization of the Caucus' Isthmus," the term Rastal is again a literal translation of Ekur, or Akur, the term Rastal is again a literal translation meaning the great mountain or great house. These appellations make obvious reference meaning the great mountain or great house. To the Great Pyramid, which could be referred to as the great house, to the Great Pyramid, and the great mountain. These places were home to the Aku, or shining ones. The Aku were a shadowy brotherhood, an enlightened and highly intelligent group of individuals who seem to have understood all of the sciences associated with mathematics, astronomy, physiology, and metaphysics, and had encoded their knowledge in certain monuments and buildings, and had encoded their knowledge one of them being the Great Pyramid of Giza. These were the very originators of the deities, such as Thoth and Hermes, These were the very originators of the deities, who would enter the world of secret societies and become all-important. So why would all three meanings of the Giza area and pyramid and the myths relate to what we have discovered, if not for the reason that what we have discovered is correct? And why would the people associated with this area be deemed to be special, bright, or shining people, if not for their seeming ability to access the illumination and hence go through the Rastal, or gateway? To access the illumination and hence With the use of huge quantities of granite encasing, the King's Chamber, let alone the five huge granite blocks, With the use of huge quantities of granite encasing, which rest above the King's Chamber, and for which egyptologists have no reason, we have here a kind of peculiar resonating magnification machine, tuned in to the human mind. Resonating magnification machine, But what is the machine for? The only thing found in the coffer was salt. But what is the machine for? This was not from embalming, as there never was a body in the pyramid. This was not from embalming, We have seen how water was the final gateway. One must pass through it within the deep recesses of the cave in order to enter the other world. Well, today, we have stolen an ancient concept, flotation tanks, and salt is the mineral used to help us float. So, the individual resting in this perfect sacred to help us float. Geometric coffer, with internal dimensions to match the Arc of the Covenant, with internal dimensions to match would be in total blackness within the fire in the middle, situated in the gateway of Giza. This great mountain of limestone and granite containing huge quantities of quartz, This great mountain of limestone and granite which when vibrated gives an electrical and magnetic energy, which has been shown to resonate at the same level as our minds, and the Earth, actually entrains our minds at the same level as our minds, and the Earth, to those of the resonance of the collective super-consciousness. To those of the resonance We tap in on a profound level, but much more than this, maybe, as the shaman the world over have claimed, that by using this powerful super-conductor of the super-consciousness, the ancient priests of even Khufu himself could enter the gateway to the other world, and actually control elements on the other side. Could enter the gateway to the other world, These elements would be subatomic energy particles, perceived in the mind's eye via resonating at the same quantum level as the Earth, to be conscious of the unconscious, but perfectly natural world, to be conscious of the unconscious, to be conscious of the world of subatomic particles, which make up everything, to actually alter these energies through our own thoughts. Ancient beings of light reside just over the horizon, we just need to open our eyes to their existence. Ancient beings of light reside just over the horizon,
