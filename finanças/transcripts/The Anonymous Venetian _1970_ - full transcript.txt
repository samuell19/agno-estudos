Direct train from Bologna-Ferrara-Padua is arriving on platform 9. Direct train from Bologna-Ferrara-Padua is arriving on platform 9. - Thank you for coming. - My lawyer told me to. - You can leave in an hour. - If an hour is enough... - No. - So here I am. - Where do you want to go? - If you don't know... - What did you do about your job? - What job? You work, don't you? In the hospital's administration. Not anymore. Now I deal with books. You've started being an intellectual? No. I only deal with books. Some publishers gave me the exclusive for the entire province, so I opened a sort of agency. Today I closed for family reasons. - Family reasons? I am touched. - I couldn't tell the truth. - What is the truth? - In fact. What is it? Sir, you're not getting your tickets? Did you ever go somewhere and have the feeling that you'd already been there? It happens to everyone. I wonder what it is! Have you ever come to Venice since then? I've returned a couple of times. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wrote, but you didn't answer. - If you say so, maybe. - It's true. Alright. Do you enjoy seeing it again? It is always beautiful. Even now. It looks like a ship at the bottom of the sea. It takes your breath away. Don't you agree? - Well? - Venice will always be Venice. Yes, even Pompei will always be Pompei. - Is it true that it's sinking? - It's what they say. Memphis and Babylon disappeared. Why should Venice survive? Sooner or later, it will go away. Would you come back to live here? - What do you mean? - Nothing. You're as closed as an urchin. Then be careful. You could get hurt. Come here! Ca' Foscari. What time was it when we met the first time? Noon? Eleven? At four in the afternoon we were already in bed. Remember? - How long can you stay? - I must be home in the evening. - Home. - Yes. Why? How should I call it? - Does he know you came? - He, who? - Who else? Him. - Yes. We tell each other everything. We have a honest relationship. He didn't comment? Or try to send the lawyer in your place? - He wanted to come in my place. - Oh, no! One of the most respectable citizens of Ferrara wanted to come to me, one of the less respectable citizens of Venice. To offer me how much? 10 million? 20? Don't laugh at him. He is a serious man. He helped me very much. - Giorgio calls him "Dad", huh? - Of course he does. - Still live here at San Samuele? - No, I've a studio at Giudecca. It's more peaceful and you can see the whole city. - But he knows he's not his father. - Oh, Giorgio! - By the way, what does he do? - He goes to school as all children. - I hope it's a nice boarding school. - Public school. - He's in seventh grade? - Sixth. Oh, right. He'll be 11 in a month. October 26th, right? - Right. - He must be a big boy. You called me for Giorgio, right? - What does your lawyer think? - Answer me. What if I wanted to make love to you? Actually, I have a right to it. We aren't even separated. At the time... You wore your hair down. - You don't want to make love to me. - Who says? I know. I am sure. You never understood a thing about me! - You called me just to make love? - Yes! Didn't you find another woman? - You know I can't live with anyone! - Yes, I know! - Well? - You always cheated on me! Marriage is not right. I realized that now. - What? - It's like a license to love. - The price is staying in the flock. - The sacrifices of a woman... The sacrifice of a married woman is pretending to get excited with her husband all her life! I don't mean you. During our relationship, we weren't at peace not even in the nicest moments. - We'd have massacred each other... - If you hadn't left? You forced me to leave. I was always faithful to you. You have very small wrinkles here that you didn't have. They look good on you. Maybe that is why you are more beautiful. Money keep you young. - You scare me. - You came because you're afraid? - I expect anything from you. - Really? Yes, anything. You're right. Let's go have coffee. I'm tired. Aren't you? - Here or there? - Same thing. - Shall we sit outside? - It's a bit cold. Or you fear what people will think? Here, they likes to gossip. They know I like prostitutes. - You hate me, don't you? - You make me hate you. Perfect. - Good morning, Professor. - Look who is here! - Bring two coffees outside. - Our maestro! - We haven't seen you in a while. - I'd like a glass of water. I read in the newspaper about the new orchestra. Congratulations. Will you conduct it, Professor? No. I won't conduct anything. Just when they need it. That's how we Venetians are. We used to export geniuses in the world. Today, even the few left don't feel like doing anything. - Then who conducts? - They conduct themselves. - What? Kids who just graduated? - They are well prepared. - They'll bring them right away. - What were those pills? Nothing. A little headache. It must be the weather. - How many did you take? - Two thousand. Why? Here, Professor. Miss. Thank you, and best wishes for the orchestra. What orchestra did he mean? Some youngsters from the conservatory set up a small chamber orchestra. What've you got to do with them? They're doing a record for an oboes and strings concert. They called me. - We've been rehearsing it. - You don't play at La Fenice now? Of course. In fact, I've become first oboe. For someone who dreamed of being a conductor this isn't such a success. - How is your mother? - My mother? - Yes. Is she dead? - You're ill-mannered as usual You haven't changed. What do you care about my mother? - You couldn't stand her. - Yes, it's true. I wanted to ask you about Giorgio, then she came up. Does it surprise you if I ask about Giorgio? - Don't I have a right to? - He's off key. Want to know that? At the school recital his teacher asked him to open his mouth and pretend to sing, or everybody will end up being off key too. He's fairly good in math and science, but he's terrible in Italian. He reads just comic books. - What does he say about me? - What should he say? - He knows that man isn't his father. - Yes, he does. We don't talk about it anymore. Maybe he doesn't even remember you. He was 3 at the time. - Doesn't he ever mention me? - He did, until a short while ago. He'd end his night prayer saying, "Protect my real father and make him happy". - How touching. - He doesn't say it anymore. - He doesn't pray anymore. Children go through periods of great religiousness. Then it's over. I think it's right to leave him free. When he was little, I was obsessed with an idea. I thought, "If I die now that my son is a year and a half, he won't remember me." I wonder if all fathers think the same thing! You've become a foreigner. A window could suddenly open! - Walk in the middle of the alley! - What? - You've two children, be careful! - I don't understand! You are touching. - How old are you? - 19. - I'm 23, almost 24. - Is this your home? No. It's a rented room. - I've never seen you at Ca' Foscari. - I go to the conservatory. Another two years, and maybe I'll be an orchestra conductor. - I hope so. - I've never been to a concert. - Are you Venetian? - Yes, and you? Me too. - I like it here. - You like it? - You are so beautiful! - Thank you. - Are you embarrassed? - No, but I've never... You've never made love with a man you just met? I've never made love. It's the most beautiful thing in the world. It'll soon go away. Where do you want to go? - You already asked me. - Really? You didn't tell me why you had me come. - You already asked that. - You didn't answer. Are you in a hurry? If so, there's a train at 12, platform 5. Bye! You can't always answer like that. Haven't you made me suffer enough? - You made me suffer too! - Alright, alright. - What? - Forget it. - How old is your other child? - Four. How time flies! Does he have his father's name or mine? His father's. I am not legally his mother. It seems like the best solution. For your child, since the father is rich. There will be divorce in Italy too, and everything will work out. Maybe something even better than divorce will come. - Which is? - In due time, my dear. Did you smell how the water stinks here? I talked to my lawyer too. He surely told you that if you report me for adultery, I won't be sentenced. - Who knows. - You think they'd give you Giorgio? You went to bed with half the sluts of Venice. A great father! - I am in a good position. - You are a concubine. They'd give me custody. I've a home and a job. - I knew that was the reason. - We could divide in half. What do you mean? It's easy. My child to me. And his, to you. Just try it. Ladies and gentlemen, I know very well it's not a custom, but I'd like to dedicate this symphony to the person who has always been close to me. With her faith in me, she has led me on the path of glory. My wife. I'll be right back. Wait for me here. I've been proposed a series of concerts in Italy and then abroad. And you'll always be with me, my love. Every night at the theater. People will look at you and say, "You see? She is his wife." Was I good? Sometimes I have thoughts that frighten me. - Meaning? - If you didn't meet me, you'd be a great orchestra conductor. Nonsense! We parted ways 7 years ago and I didn't achieve a thing. I wasn't talented enough. So much the better! - Why? - I know why. - Hello! - How are you? It is always after me, but I don't let her get me! I can have emotionally weak moments, too. What's wrong with seeing that house again? It was our love nest. It's what they call it, right? We loved and hated each other there. It's where our son was born. - Everything happened there. - That is why it's a nightmare. - Me too? - You, what? - Was I a nightmare? - You hurt me. - Then why did you come? - You called me. Whatever the reason, I am willing to do anything. I will defend what I have in every way. Remember that. - Even money? - So it's a matter of money. There it is. - See the kitchen? Big, comfortable. - How much is it a month? - Later. - Let's go make love. The living room is cold in the winter, but there's an electric heater. -The master bedroom? - It's the nicest room in the home. Come. I lived here for almost 30 years. - It looks out on the Campo, right? - Certainly, madam. It is a lovely position. Central, silent. Look. - Let's go make love. - Wait! Are you newlyweds? Remember the window? - Yes, the third from the corner. - They painted them all. Remember how many times we asked them? - Where are you going? - I'd like to see it again. - Mrs. Gemma will let us up. - It bothers me a bit... She knows nothing about us. - Who is it? - Is Mrs. Gemma home? What do you want? We lived here a few years ago. - It's a dressmaker's shop. - May we come up? It's closed now. It's a dressmaker's shop. - What do you think? - It's time that you grow up. Precious advice, but it won't take long. - Stop for a second. Don't move. - What is it? Too bad. You moved. For a moment, I saw you as you were. All eyes and bones. - Remember how I called you? - Toothpick. - What else? - Little bones. I was always hungry. All I did was eat. A lustful bride. I've never seen anyone who desires making love so much. You always wanted to, also. It may all have gone to pot, but nobody has ever made love as we did. Maybe that's why it ended as it did. It was too wonderful to last. - I saw your man in Ferrara. - What? From a distance while he was leaving his factory. - How can you make love with him? - I do it, not you! Sure, and only with him, or is there someone else sometimes? That's my business! - Go back to the station if you want. - No, not now. I was a model and then a substitute teacher in an evening school. Remember that you left us without any money? I know what I went through. It was hell. And always alone, in every way. When I met Emilio, I was desperate. I couldn't go on. He was beginning to achieve a position. He's not as you think. He's a self-made man. He worked 14 hours a day, as still does even now that he runs a company. If I tell him "Come home earlier tonight" or "Take me on a trip", you may laugh, but he does it. - Maestro. - Hi. It's not money that matters, but respect, real, clean emotions, the peace that he created around me. He is fond of Giorgio, and Giorgio likes being with us. We would've married. You disappeared when I wanted an annulment. You pretend to despise him because he's full of money. Instead, you hate him because he is successful. - Why did you want to see him? - You see those baskets? They fill them with newborn crabs. 700, 800. As many as fit. After a few months, they pull them up and sell the remaining crabs that grew by eating the weaker ones. Did you know that? - What did you want from Emilio? - I don't give a darn about him! Nor of you or Giorgio! When why did you come to Ferrara, and now call me? Go away! Go away if you have the courage. If you two are so strong! If I can't do anything for you, go away! - You don't know how much I hate you! - I hate you too! Your middle class mentality disgusts me, these fear! As soon as you arrived, you said you talked to your lawyer, and I can't take anything from you! Did I ask you for anything? Go back to your partner! Make love with him! I know that when you two make love, I'm there too! Not here. Here! You're dreadful! Dreadful! You always played around with me, with my fears. You always want to be the strongest! I hate you! - You're dreadful! - Stop it! I shouldn't have come. Stop it now. Dry your eyes. I want to take you somewhere. - Where? - You'll see. Let's go. Come on. What's the sense of this pilgrimage? Nothing. Not everything has to have sense. - Let's sit outside, huh? - Alright. - Adriano, we're sitting outside. - As long as you're happy... Why did you argue with the maestro during the rehearsal? Ask him. I'll call the kids for rehearsal. You order. - What will you have? - I don't know. What you're having. - What do you want to start with? - What is there? Rice with squid, fish soup, spaghetti, fettuccine, lasagna... - Spaghetti for two. Big portions. - After that? - We'll see. - White or red wine? I'm not staying in Venice. What'll I do here? - What are those two drinking? - Soligo, a local wine. That one. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Adolfo isn't here anymore? - Not for many years. Thank you. You used to wear your hair down. Rehearsal is at 8:15 tonight. I can't accompany you to the train. It doesn't matter. I'd rather go to Alaska, I said to him. There's always someone who starts again. - It's right, isn't? - Well... I'd like to say to him, "Go before it's too late". Or, "Here is the key to my home. There's a big bed there". There's a big bed? I wasn't thinking what you think. I just want to make fun of you. - Flaubert was a genius. - Why Flaubert? Nothing. May I drink to your happiness? First tell me what Flaubert has to do with it. He's a guy who wrote a novel entitled "Madame Bovary". I know that. What else? Bovarism is so rooted in the feminine soul that a woman finds pleasure in betraying her lover by going to bed with her husband. May I drink to your happiness, wherever it may be? Who knows if I ever stopped loving you? - I know. - What? You never stopped. If you think I'll come make love with you, you're wrong. I don't think anything. - Here. - Spaghetti? What a magnificent idea! Is there a meaning? What did I say when they brought spaghetti? - What did I say? - You said, "Eat". And then? Come on. I said, "Eat", and then? "After we'll make love." "After we'll make love." Was it beautiful? No, please. I want to know. Was it beautiful? With you... marvelous. - Are they embarrassing you? - No. Here they come! Cheers for the newlyweds! - A toast. Best wishes and happiness! - Thank you, everyone. Best wishes, madam. Cheers! Mr. Alvise! Lucky you for marrying a musician. You'll tour the world. I was born in Giudecca and haven't even been in St. Mark's Square! This union two twin souls, love, mercy, sacrifice... You are so beautiful! You will follow your husband. And you will provide for your wife and children. I'd like to add something else that will make you more aware of the great gift... The most beautiful bride of Venice. - Why did you let your hair down? - No reason. You looked so good! - When did you go to Ferrara? - Last week. - I called you from there. - Did you want to see Emilio? It's hard to explain. I was curious to see him there, but... actually, I came to see you and Giorgio. - Giorgio? - I saw you one afternoon. You went out, caught a taxi. You were very elegant. Today you're dressed as if you were poor. You feared your money would strike me? - And Giorgio? - I don't know if I saw him. Around 2:00, I saw three boys go inside your building. They looked like they were returning from school. About 10, 11 years old. One of them was fairy tall, dark haired. Long hair. He had a blue turtle neck sweater. I thought he looked like me. I hoped to hear the voice of kin inside, but it didn't work. Nothing. Maybe it only works for decent fathers. Forget us, please. Ours is not a great life. Maybe we aren't even too happy. Al least as far as I'm concerned. But we have everything we need. We live peacefully. Giorgio is healthy, and grows well. He is serene. Please, if you love him a bit forget us. How can you live in Ferrara with that person? I hate you when you ask these sort of questions. What else could I have done? Was I to look for clients under St. Mark's Square? In Ferrara we gave good friends who believe, or who pretend to believe, that I am Emilio's wife! You see? I wear a wedding band. I wouldn't ever live in Venice again. It's rotten! These colors come from the decay that has devoured it for centuries! It's dying! It will go back to being the mud that it was. That is what makes it beautiful. Not everyone understands. You must have the sense of death inside. You have the sense of death inside? Since when? - Who knows. Maybe since forever. - You're just a clown. - Say it again. - You're a clown! Maybe you're right, but I am dying. What do you mean? We are all dying. But I will die soon. Five or six months. Maybe less, the doctors said. What are you saying? The truth, my dear. This isn't another deceit, is it? No. This time... Unfortunately not. - Can something be done? - No. What do you have? Pain... Pain here. I love you! I love you! I love you! The bad part would be losing your personality and ending up like this, a little at a time. These things play ugly tricks. It depends on how they evolve. Great stuff! What frightens me isn't physical pain. For that, you can take pain killers, injections. A terrible illness! People never talk about it. Strange. As if it didn't exist. If I forget something and don't recognize a person, or if I've the impression of already having been in a place where I am sure I've never been... It can happen to everyone, but when it happens to me, it's different. One must learn how to accept it. But I don't think I will accept going out like a candle, without doing anything. I was always missing something to be a real man, even in this circumstance. Be quiet a moment. Let me count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... Wait a minute. Sir, could you hold this a moment? We'd like to play flag-stealing but we're an even number. Of course. Thank you. Thank you, miss! He accepted. Let's make teams! Ready? Let's begin. Four. - Come on! - Jump! 1 to 0. - Ready? Five! - Bravo! - Be careful. - Ready? - Two! - Come on! - I wish you were already dead. - I know. I wish that, too. But one must be patient. Excuse me. Are you boarding? - No. - I'm sorry. You can't stay here. It's forbidden. Follow me. I'll accompany you. What do you expect me to do now? Absolutely nothing. Come on. - Is this concert important? - It is, for me. Benedetto Marcello or Alessandro. We don't know yet. We call him "Anonymous Venetian". It was written 250 years ago, during the splendor of Venice. It seems like the funeral lament for this city. We did the allegro. It came out well. Tonight we're rehearsing the largo. It's marvelous. If you want, I'll take you to the station. There's a train at 4:00. Take me to your place. - No. I get angry if you think... - I don't think anything. - Is that one? - Yes. - I like it here. - You like it? A bachelor's place. As you see, I changed everything, too. Nothing from that time is left. This is left. That is always here. - What do your women say? - They don't believe you are my wife. I say you ran away with a rich man, and they answer that you have a bitch face. My dear, I write to you after 7 years to avoid any misunderstanding. I am killing myself because I have an incurable illness and I don't want to end like this, day after day. I would've wanted to call you here and tell you personally, but I didn't do so because... - You want to drink something? - No, thank you. After having recorded the music, I'll get drunk every night. Every once in a while some drunkard falls in a canal and dies. - Where will you record it? - At San Vidal. It's a deconsecrated church. The kids rented it. The acoustic is perfect. Concerts were held there in the 18th century. Can you leave everything and come to Ferrara once you've recorded it? - At your place? - No. I was thinking of a clinic. One where I could be close to you. You must be out of your mind. I could never die... I could never wait to die in another city. Not because I was born here, or it's the most beautiful city in the world. But because it is in agony. As you said earlier. And I have the sensation of dying with it. - You called, and I will stay. - No. You'll leave on the 6:10 train. - At 9:35, the last one. - No. You'll be at Ferrara at 11:00. You'll see the rehearsal and leave. - That's 5 and a half hours away. - 5 and a half hours before leaving. And four hours before rehearsal. Four hours before rehearsal. No, it wasn't your fault. You always gave your whole self when you made love. Ferociously... We were young. I'm still young. I won't ever become a man. I won't be able to become a man. I can't say, "in a year", "in a month"... Maybe not even "in a week". At times I think, "next spring"... - Be quiet. - There won't be a next spring. - Please be quiet. - Why? I'm the one who will die! If I can't speak... You must listen to me! - No! - You know what marks the end? Eyesight. One morning I'll open my eyes and it will be dark! - No! Enough! - Why enough? You must listen to me till the end. - Enough! - Already I can't see anymore. I can't see the contour of things. Did you recognize my eyes? Did you see how I looked at you all day? - You're just hurting yourself! - Now you know why I called you! I needed someone to suffer with. That's the reason. Understand? When something like this happens, you go crazy if you are alone. You go crazy. And only you exist. Irreplaceable. You left and I remained alone. Only you know how to suffer with me. That is what I wanted. Enough now. Really, enough. Is that it? Don't tell Giorgio we saw each other. Just have him listen to the concert when he grows up. May I say that you were thinking of him while you played? And of you. I called Ferrara. You should advise that you're catching the last train. - I thought I'd do it at the station. - I won't hear you. I don't exist. Hello? Giorgio. Yes, hi. It's Mom, from Venice. Wait a moment. It's Giorgio. You want to talk to him? Tell your father I am not coming with the rapid train. No, I won't call him. You advise him. Tell him I'll be there at 11:00 with the last train. Yes. Tell him not to worry. Everything is fine. No. Have dinner without me. I'll get something. Bye. Here. A record player and a recorder. - They don't have them, do they? - No. I am sure. This is for Giorgio and this is for the other one. - What is his name? - Anna Maria. It's a girl. A girl? Remember that I wanted a girl? I wouldn't have been a better father. This is for Giorgio and this is for Anna Maria. It's easier to use. - I'll take these two. How much? - I'll make out the bill. - Shall I send them home? - No, wrap them up. Thank you. I'll kill you. If what happened to you happened to me, what would you have done? Among your books, I saw one with a marked page. "Suicide as an intervention in one of the two facts that escape man, life and death." - When something like this happens, anyone thinks of suicide. Life wants to screw you, but you'll screw it. You'll become the strongest. You couldn't do it. You didn't finish the letter for me. - And so? - Then you're not the strongest! You're just a poor devil who is dying and is afraid! Sure! When I fall asleep, I'm afraid that death will come when I sleep. I'm afraid when I meet a person and think, "Why me and not him?" I'm afraid when I play because I could die there holding this! Why shouldn't I be afraid? - I did the audition at La Fenice. - How did it go? Right now I'm second oboe, but maybe substitute conductor. But it's temporary. You know I don't want to stay here in Venice. And now I'll buy you a queen's dress. As the queens of the past that on big occasions, dressed in gold and silver. - No, please. - You don't want it? They make the best brocades in the world here. Yes, I know. But why? You have no sense of convenience. Don't think about the inheritance. Let me splurge. If it's still open. I am always lucky! They haven't succumbed to machines yet here. Some looms are over 300 years old. There is more poetry in the world than we think. - You are so beautiful! - Did you say something? No. They said you were here. You don't come often. How are you? - We have little time. My wife. - Your wife? - Good evening. - Can you show her something? Of course. You know the way. Please, madam. "In the life of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, ends up with trying on a new dress." Proust. Remember, my love, when we read it together? It was said with much wit, don't you think? - All done? - Yes. Make out the bill right away and send it to the station, the 9:30 train for Bologna. - Alright. - Please, madam. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Keep in touch. - Bye. I hope you are pleased, madam. I once saw a drowned dog being pulled up. It was horrible. All swollen. Who knows how much water it had swallowed! It looked like a rubber toy. Only its eyes... They were still open, staring at you, serious, grave. Its eyes were full of dignity. I am always the last. Let's say goodbye here. I'll be back. Absolutely not. - Don't you want... - I'd like to have you till the end. But I am embarrassed. Understand? Yes, I understand. I only gave you damage. No. You can do anything to me. Because I am your husband? Or because I am dying? Because I love you. Do you remember the first thing I told you this morning? "Thank you for coming." Thank you for coming. Done! Pull up! - Here I am! - Finally! - Good evening, Professor. - I am always last. Don't worry. You'll pay coffee tonight too. It's not all my fault. My wife wanted to accompany me. - Good evening, madam. - Good evening. - She'll stay a while if it's okay. - No. If she doesn't mind... - I'd begin with rehearsing. - As you wish. I'd record this one, too. - Alright. - Thank you. Whenever you want. - Ready? - Impatient. Be quiet. Ready? Ready? Alright. Ready! Anonymous Venetian, concert in D minor for oboe and strings. Second movement. Adagio. Rehearsal recording. Excuse me. You should go, my love. They're waiting home. Let's start over. Ready? Anonymous Venetian, concert in D minor for oboe and strings. Second movement. Adagio. Rehearsal recording. Oh, my God!
