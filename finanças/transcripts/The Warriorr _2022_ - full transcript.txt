-Hey… -Hey… No, no, no! Spray colours on my son, Satya, first. If you still have the guts, then come and get me. Hmm. -Hey, hey… -Wait, wait, wait! Wait! You want to apply colours on Nitya?

Careful! -Bye, okay! Rajakumari, you seem to be going somewhere with your son? My son has completed his MBBS. We are going to Kurnool for his internship. Call that taxi guy once. He said he will be around here. Hello! [Whistle] Hi, hello, welcome, Namaste! This is your whistle Mahalakshmi. Before the song, let me share an interesting incident with you. A friend of mine who recently bought a villa ordered a name board reading Sukkupalli Prasad, 11 A. The guy who made the name board seemed to have asked him- ‘I've done ten A's in in your name. Where should I paint the 11th one?’ If I tell you my friend’s response, this show will be rated A. Keep listening to Mirchi 98.3. It's very hot, boss. What’s happening? Why are we moving in circles? I keep seeing the same shops! All shops look the same here, madam. I understand shops looking alike. How come people look alike too? If you don’t know the way, ask someone. Sorry, sir. I will find out. Hey, girl! Can you direct me to this address? Follow me. [Whistling] Okay. What is her problem? At this rate, we won't reach home today. Thank you! [Whistling] How much for the coconuts? Give me two. Hey! She is not going to help us. Move. We will ask someone else. But she is… -No need. -Move! -Okay, okay. -Okay. -Sheer waste of time. Had you followed me, you would have reached earlier. Huh? You were taking breaks as you like. You expect us to follow you? Hello, hello! One minute. Uncle called up and told me about new tenants, a doctor's family. And to buy them the flowers, fruits, coconuts etc, etc for puja. The bill is inside. Thanks. You settle in first. We will settle this later. Oho! What happened? -My husband is breathless, sir. -Turn him over! -I am scared, sir. -Turn him! Get a pillow. Sir, please save my husband. -Go that side. Hey! Let’s go. Sir! -Sir, where is the emergency room? -Take him to the ICU. -Rahim, take him. -Yes, doctor! Nurse! Hey, suffocation is high. Put him on oxygen immediately. -Don’t worry they will take care. -One minute, sir. Load injection 1 cc. Hello! They will take care. You are? Sir, I am Doctor Satya. I have come to join duty. I am on the way to meet the Dean. And you? Oh! Good. I am Robert. Dean of this hospital. Oh, sir! It’s you! You started attending as soon as you arrived? Oh, no. Sorry, sir. I've joined duty without meeting you. No issues, Satya. Doctor’s profession is meant for service. You did the right thing, Come. Let’s go in and talk. Hello, Kurnool! This is your whistle Mahalakshmi. And to break you into splits of laughter as always, I'll share an interesting incident that happened to me yesterday. An arrogant mother and an innocent son landed in Kurnool from Hyderabad. They wanted some address and I asked them to follow me. On the way I stopped at a few shops for small purchases. That’s it. They felt it was waste of time and took a diversion, roamed all around and finally reached the address. But I had been waiting there for half an hour by then. When they realised my purchases were meant for them, you must see their faces! Keep listening. Stay tuned… Damn this girl! It happened only yesterday. And she sold the story to the radio! She seems cheeky, mom! We better be careful with her. Hmm. Please take her to the doctor quickly. Is it a crime to talk about marriage? Sir, please do something. -Sir, what happened? -Sir, my only daughter. She consumed poison because I discussed wedding. Please save her somehow, sir. Take her to the emergency room. Sir, you have to save her. Don’t panic. I will take care. Okay? Don’t worry! Watch me give a new treatment. Get the tube, Sister! -Sir! -Not that one. The bigger one. -Sir… -There is a bigger one on the top. -Sir, such a big one? -It’s okay. That will do. Hmm. This is correct. The poison must have reached her brain. Watch me drain it. Send this to the brain through the nose… -Hey, hey! What is this? Such a big tube! Ah! You tube! How can you insert such a big tube into my nose? But you consumed poison. This is how you should be treated. Lie down. Hey! What are trying to do? Are you a real doctor or fake? I will tell you what is real and what is fake. Sir, my only daughter. She consumed poison because I discussed wedding. When you swallow poison and are unconscious, you don’t do this when a fly sits on your nose. Bring her to emergency room. I saw all your drama there. Actually… He was insisting on the wedding and so I faked taking poison. That’s all. Oye! Are you not interested in marriage? Or do you have a boyfriend? What do you want now? As a dad it is his responsibility to get you married, isn’t it? How much parents sacrifice for us! Can’t we sacrifice a bit for them? Are you a doctor or a marriage broker? This is our family matter. You are in no way concerned. You air everyone’s family matters on the radio. When it comes to you, you switch it off. Hey, don’t. If a loving father tells his daughter… ‘Get married’, will she drink poison and die? What can we talk to kids these days? If we ask them 'where did you go', kids are getting angry, sir. What can we say? -Sir! -Sir, what happened? -Your daughter has left. -Ah! My daughter has left this world? She left for home, sir. Home? -Sir! You are god, sir. -Ok! Are there such handsome doctors? Especially this boy! Will you agree to this wedding or not? Don’t you want me to be happy? I am not getting any younger. So you want me to say yes? -Hey, they will see you! -Mom! What happened? Father and daughter have been quarrelling since morning. Look at them shouting. How long should I wait? Such a good match is rare to come by. You don’t know how hard I worked for this… What’s her problem? Why can’t she marry as her dad says? See what I will do. Watch I will do to myself. Hide. She will see you. Dad! Please, go quickly. Please, fast. Hey, hey! Wait. What happened? My dad took poison. You were here the other day and he was there. You exchanged places today? Family drama, huh? No, sir! He took poison for real. Please, save him. Okay, okay. Take him. Take him fast. Sir, please! He is my only father, sir. I guess you are really stressed. Everyone has only one father. I will take care. Okay? Get the tube! Sister, wash his stomach. What is your problem actually? As your dad, what’s wrong if he wants to see you married? Please. Can you just stay quiet? Every father wants his kids to marry at the right age. Why don’t you consider it? Consider what? The wedding- I know. I know what it is not to have a dad. My treatment is not going to make him better. But one word from you… just one word will make him recover. Why don’t you give in at least for his happiness? Forget it. You have consented. -You have consented. You have agreed. -Hey, hey, no. I didn’t. This is the treatment I am going to give him. That’s all. -Are his vitals stable? -Yes, doctor. -Mr Madhav? -Huh? You are fine. And good news. You daughter has agreed to the wedding. Careful. -Has she? Really? -Yes. She has. You can happily make arrangements for the wedding. -Can I make a phone call? -Oh, please. Carry on. Carry on. Thank you, doctor. Hello! Oye! Didn’t I tell you? Your one word… see how happy it has made him! Mahesh! My daughter has agreed to the wedding. Who is Mahesh? The boy you are going to marry? Nice name. It’s not Mahesh. It’s Maheswari. Oh! So, he is talking to your mom? Not mom. To a girl. I don’t get it. Wedding is not mine. Are you happy now? It’s his. I love you, Mahi. My daughter has consented to our wedding. Hello! You know the pain of not having a dad around. But I know the pain of having such a dad. Hey, what’s happening there? Huh? What’s going on there? Hey, hey! Are you running away? "The bond between you and me is beyond comprehension!" Are you serious? He was talking about his wedding? I didn’t know that and I was busy convincing her. He kept saying ‘getting older’. Did he mean himself? Exactly. -Aunty! -What is it, whistle? I heard your dad's getting married. Matter’s very interesting. Won’t this play on FM? If it does, it will be a super-hit. Attention, please! How dare you defy us? How dare you? Attention, please! Hey! Hey! Look! Call the ambulance! Hey! Look! Satya, tell me. Thanks, mom. For what? For making me a doctor. It was your dad’s dream. You should thank him. But why do you say it now? Someone was hacked in the middle of the road. -Hacked in the middle of the road? -Yes, mom. I brought him to the hospital and treated him. First time… I saved a life, mom. When he opened his eyes and looked at me, I felt I was a new person. It felt like a rebirth. Only a mother and a doctor know the value of life, mom. I will make sure no one dies on my watch. Okay, mom. I will call you back. Hey! Hey! I hear a defiant tone. Who is it? Who is he? There is no one, sir. Please carry on. Someone just shouted. Who is it? Sir… he is a new doctor who came for internship, sir. He is new to Kurnool, sir. He has absolutely no idea of you. I will make him understand, sir. He may be new to Kurnool. But death is no stranger to a doctor. Would you tell him? Or should I? Sir, I will inform him, sir. You know what to write in the report, don’t you? Sir, it was an accident, sir. -Satya, stop! -Satya, please, Satya. Please listen to me! Satya, listen to me! Satya, control yourself. What is this, sir? I saved a dying man, sir. They took the very life I saved, sir. You are like my son. So, listen to me. You don’t know who they are, Satya. Don’t. Forget it. Who cares, sir? They are Guru’s men. Who is Guru? Do you know who Guru is? Guru is not a person. He is a Democle's sword hanging above the public. You stay alive only if he allows. Law and order are at his command. Natural death percentage is very low here. Bodies in the mortuary are mostly sent by Guru. He kills a person and plants a tree. And those plants are beyond numbers. He picked up a knife at the age of 14. How monstrously he killed him! Hey! Let’s get the body of the killer. Let's carry both the bodies together. Hey! Why are you going? My son is here! He will kill him. Hey, Guru! Kill him! Hey! What have you done, Guru! Hey, Guru! Plant a sapling. Whenever you take a life, you must substitute it. [CENTRAL JAIL] It's been ages since I saw you! How are you, Guru? Guru! What happened, uncle? It’s all over, Guru! It's Kumarappa’s regime now. He was a small time money lender. But now he is a powerful billionaire. As interest on the loan your dad took him from him, he snatched your house,the mill and the farms...everything, Guru. When we went to question him, see what Kumarappa had done. No one has the guts to confront him, Guru! Make it fast! How long will you take for a such a simple job! Brother! Hey! Take your hand off the vehicle. Wipe it. Clean it! Who is it? You confiscated my house and this mill against my father's loan. I have come to claim them. Who are you? Paramanna’s son? You want your house and the mill? You went to jail for killing someone as a kid. So you think you are a hero? How dare you look into my eyes? Look down. Hey! Make him understand and send him. Huh? Guru! Hey! I told you not to mess with him! See what they have done! Let’s wait for him to die. Else he won’t spare us until we die. Go look who it is. Wait! Kumarappa! Kumarappa is here. Go away immediately. Hey, hey, take him and leave from behind. Go! -Get up. -Open the door, uncle. Hey! What did you say? Open the door! What do you mean? Open it! Guru! I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Here. I got all your property papers. They are all yours. Now let him go. Hey! Dad! Please leave my dad. Dad! Please let my dad go. Lower your eyes. I should get back all my property. Here. Take them all. Let go of my son, Guru. Hey! Why is he talking about his son? Keep the documents in the safe. I don’t understand. I said keep the documents in the safe. Okay. Hey! What is this? Why is the boy in the safe? Keep the documents in the safe and hand over the boy to him.-Dad! Okay! Dad! Dad! Come, son! Dad! I am leaving. I will never disturb you again. Dad! Let’s go! Sit! -Dad! -Hey! Dad! Leave the vehicle behind. Okay. Okay. Let’s go. Let’s go. That day Kurnool surrendered to Guru. Not just Kumarappa, the entire Kurnool was afraid of Guru. Kumarappa's daily collections were diverted to Guru. -Uncle! -Huh? Count and take it. A girl saved Gurus's life when he was attacked by an enemy. Mr. Guru! He liked the girl and took her home. The son of the man Guru had killed as a child, Mari, tried to kill Guru as well. But he kept him close in his gang. Do you know who he is? My cousin! You came home to kill me, right? You shouldn't leave unless you kill me. Stab me and if I die, you will live. Stab me and if I don’t die, I will teach you practically how to stab. The murders Guru committed and the trees he planted are beyond numbers. You carry a knife on you all the time! It is not even sharp! Stab me. Let’s see if it goes in. Stab! This was planted for your dad. Make sure no sapling is planted in your name. Someone has to spring out of earth to kill me! [B. DEVARAJU, SI] -Hey! -He is dumb, sir. So? Has he gone blind! Wipe it. Vest… vest… wipe it with your vest. Idiot! Damn! Sir, they hacked someone in broad daylight right on the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you? Sir, I am Dr Satya. I recently joined the GH. Hmm. Tell me. I took a dying man to the hospital, treated him and saved his life, sir. But they entered the hospital and killed him, sir. When I asked around I was told they are Guru’s men, sir. Who are you going to complain against? Guru, sir. People walk in. They lodge a complaint. And the very next minute- ‘My mother was threatened. My sister was kidnapped.’ And they withdraw the case. I hope you won’t do that? I will lodge a complaint. But I hope you won’t buckle under pressure and not take action? Write it. Don’t scribble like a prescription. Write legibly. Please read it, sir. You will understand. Ever ready! You are not the first person. How many days more? -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. -Take care of it whatever it is. -Okay, brother. -Send the medicines in time. -Sure, brother. Greetings, Devaraju. -How are you? -I am good. Hey, Devaraju! How come your are here? -I need to talk to Mr Guru. -Guru? Guru is busy otherwise. Wait for a while. What soap do you use? You smell so good! Dad! Shh! Put me down. Kid is here. -Hey, why are you here? -Inspector Devaraj is here. He is a kid! Swarna! -Hey! You couldn’t find another time? -Hey, don’t touch my head. -Brother! -Hmm? Someone lodged a complaint against our boys. It’s a very serious matter. I wanted to keep you in the loop. Don’t talk while eating. -Shut up and eat. -Okay, brother. Bye the way, will no one ask how to eat with your mouth shut? Huh? I was just joking. [KURNOOL CITY RAILWAY STATION] Hey, how is mom? Mom is fine. Waiting for you. You boarded the train there. Brother-in-law sent a car here. Continuous calls about the car and asking me to take care of you. How much your husband loves you! -Who? Your brother-in-law? -Hmm. He must have downed four beers because I am not home. By the time I go back, he will have a bigger tummy than mine. -Bah! This girl whistles like a rowdy! -Good morning to you all! -I’m your whistle Mahalakshmi. -Hey! -You are listening… -Did you call her a rowdy? This whistle is damn popular here. -Everyone knows Whistle Mahalakshmi. -Uh-huh? -The girl has a lot of following. -Hmm. What? In drunk and drive cases. But you be careful and attentive. -Isn't her voice sweet? -Oh! And most important… don’t simply pick fights . Idiots! Why is he so rash? Crazy fellow! Are you okay? Be alert. Wear your seat belt. -How can I with such a big stomach! -I said wear your belt! Hey! What's happening? I am coming home for my delivery. But I almost had my delivery in the car. Who were they? I will tell you. Mom shouldn’t know. Don’t blabber, okay? Okay. I won’t. Mom! Come on! Come, come, come! How are you, dear? I am good, mom. Why are you sweating? You look as if you walked home. Did you drive her home or not? Mom, mom, mom! Nothing has happened. -But actually- -I said I am fine. Satya, tell me what happened. Mom, mom, mom! Let’s go. Don't you start an enquiry as soon as I come! Make me some coffee. Come. Go! I had told you. I warned you not to interfere with him. Your sister is pregnant. If this accident took place, three lives! Try to understand. As soon as you lodged the complaint, the inspector must have gone to Guru. You worked hard and got a top rank. It’s not easy to become a doctor. Sir, what do you mean? Do you want me to walk away when they killed the man I saved? Hey! Doctors should have kindness and compassion. Not temper. Control it. They are hooligans. That's how they are. Withdraw the complaint and confine to your job. Sir, come what may, I will not withdraw the complaint. I am doing my job. Let the police do their job. Please! Satya! Satya! Please listen to me. The police here work for Guru. Someone efficient will come some day. Lodge the complaint then. Justice will be done. Sir, I can’t wait till then, sir. You can’t wait. But they are scared. Who? The wife and the son of the man who died in the hospital. ‘Some doctor has raised a complaint. How are you both connected?’ That's what they asked her. They are also asking if her son was fathered by the same guy. Pity. They are simple people. I told you. Huh? What happened now? You spoke like a stud. When you go to the hospital, follow what the doctor says. When you go to the police station, shut your crap and listen. You filed a complaint promising not to withdraw the case. Waste of paper and waste of time. Hm? What did you say? ‘Don’t buckle under the pressure of phone calls and not take action...’ Where did you get the phone call from? Huh? Hey! If you come back to the station, I will break your legs. Tell him! Hey, 401. Tell him. They have nothing better to do. They simply waste our time. Welcome to all present here to witness the state level bull fight at Kurnool. Entering the arena is brother Guru's young bull. Watch! It resembles a lion! It stands like brother Guru. It combats like brother Guru. Its horns are as sharp as brother Guru. In its anger we see brother Guru’s aggression. He says it takes after Guru. -Don’t tell me Guru seered it. -It resembles a lion! It has pounced. It got in! Hey, hey, catch him. Catch him! You can't catch it by its tail. You can't catch its tail! One, one... only one should catch it. Look, look! How he jumps in air! For the past eight years there is no one in Seema who could handle Guru’s bull! Hey! Careful, careful. Wow, wow… This is brother's bull. It has no rival in Seema. -Hey, I will be right back. -Hmm. Great tradition, isn't it? What’s the point watching the game from far? Why don’t you get into the arena and show your valour? Valour is not just in getting into the arena. Valour is also in saving the wounded in the arena. -Runs like a lion -Hmm. You manage quite well. Is there no man in Seema to tackle this bull? Is there no man? Look! Look! Brother Guru’s bull has won. Guru's bull has no rival in Rayalaseema. Open the top two buttons. Ruffle your hair a bit. Add a little style to your walk. And you are also hero material. -What did you say? -Nothing! Hello! The bull has long since gone. Will you let go now? Hm? Nothing. I hope you won’t run a show ‘Ongole bull saves me from Kurnool bull’? No. I will put it differently. Till now whistle Mahalakshmi’s program was on air. Now whistle Mahalakshmi is in air. I'll say that. Hey, you have saved me. Come. Let me give you a treat. Shall we go out? Where to? Coffee shop? Why? You think girls invite you only to coffee shops? Shall we go for a drink? -You? -Hmm. -Drinks? -Hmm. I saw how you handled drink in the hospital that day. Drinks, my foot. Okay. Let’s go to a coffee shop then. Where is your bike? Are we going to different coffee shops? Let’s go. Why don’t we take the other route? It has too many speed breakers. Let’s take this route. It’s okay. Go. "Thud-thud beats my heart It means you are coming near" "Softly, gently falls the moon-light It means you are here right now" Stop, stop. You were right. There are too many speed breakers. Let’s go back. "Your whistle turned into a poem when I heard it I turned into a poet" "Who knows how to decipher pyramids? I am a pyramid of your thoughts" "Thud-thud beats my heart It means you are coming near" "Softly, gently falls the moon-light It means you are here right now" "Knowing kohl is black, you apply it to your eyes and praise it to the skies" "My heart swells each moment for you and yet you dismiss me" "You pass by me just now but I find you elsewhere" "You cast a net not letting me move anywhere" "You confront me asking what I have ever done" "As I stare at you helplessly, you show me no empathy" "Thud-thud beats my heart It means you are coming near" "Softly, gently falls the moon-light It means you are here right now" Open the top two buttons. Ruffle your hair a bit. Add a little style to your walk. And you are also hero material. "An ant loves falling into honey" -Aunty, it’s your turn now. -What? Using a finger? "I love falling in love with you more" -Watch me now. "Comets shooting harm the earth" -How? I was really shocked. "When I don’t see you it hurts me bad" -Without the hand, she just whistled. [Whistling] Like this? "I keep rewriting what I wrote" "This strange poem is never boring" "I see you every day and yet I come back each day" "However long I look at you, it just doesn’t suffice" "Thud-thud beats my heart It means you are coming near" "Softly, gently falls the moon-light It means you are here right now" Try this chutney. Aunty, who is this? Your sister? This sort of buttering is nothing new. Tell me what you want. Nothing, aunty! One more Idly… Hey! Eat before you go! -Bye! -Hmm. Normally boys whistle at girls and follow them. He is following a girl who whistles. Did you see? Oh! Good morning, uncle! Good morning. I am going home today. Oh! You can. -How are you now? -I am better, sir. No problem. You will be fine in two days. -Okay, sir. -Okay? Good! What happened? I don’t know, doctor. It beats me. I just gave her saline. Hold the girl. What? Shit! Remove the drip! Don’t inject NW company’s medicine. Inform all the hospitals. -Okay, Doctor! -Doctor! Look at my son! -I don’t know what’s happening? -What happened? I just put him on the drip. And he was convulsing, sir. -Take him to ER! -Okay, sir! -Take them to the Emergency. -Okay, sir! -Doctor! Attend to those beds. -Where are we getting these medicines from? -Satya, wait. -Sir, please take a look here. This is because of this medicine. Whose company is this NW? They are making medicines to kill people. Sir! As per medical guidelines, endotoxin should be only 0.5 per cent. -But these have 2.5 percent, sir. -Satya! Who gave the approval for purchase without following regulations, sir? I will tell you. Come aside. Don’t magnify the issue, Satya. Do you know who owns this company? Guru’s proxy, Ravi’s. We can do nothing about this. Listen to me and drop the issue now. -Doctor! -Stand up to him, no one will be safe. Two kids have died in there. -Doctor! My daughter… -Three more are in critical condition. -Sir! Look here. -Nurse! Just a while ago, sir. She wished me good morning and said she is going home today. But before that she is gone. Shall we still stay silent, sir? Shall we leave them to their fate? Sir, three kids died and several are dangling between life and death. They are doing business with the lives of kids, sir. But we shouldn’t get angry. Because we are doctors. Because doctors stand for kindness and compassion. Right, sir? What are we going to do now, sir? What shall we tell them? 'Please don’t get emotional.' 'This is all we can do.' 'We are helpless.' Shall we tell them that? Speak up, sir. Parents have lots of hopes for their children, and with the same amount of faith they bring them to the doctor, sir. Why do we need this stethoscope and this coat, sir? Calm down! Satya! Please. Please, calm down. Sir, please don’t control me. I won’t let them go scot-free. This bloody NW… Claiming Ravikanth, who is running the Pharma mafia, is Guru's fiduciary, Dr Satya gave the District Collector all evidences to this effect. Ravikanth who is Guru's right hand committed many financial crimes. Due to adulterated medicine in Kurnool Government Hospital, 18 children fell unconscious. Two of them died while eight are battling for life. I have nothing to do with this case. I will be out in a day. Do you understand, huh? What action are you going to take against them? You have arrested the proxy Ravichandra. When will you arrest Guru, sir? We will arrest culprits very soon with all the evidence. Okay, we’ll let you know. Dr Satya brought the incident to light that took several lives. Satya, Satya, Satya! Entire Kurnool chants the name of Dr Satya. Dr Satya put an end to Pharma mafia playing with the lives of people. Shall we whistle for the young, dynamic doctor, Satya? -Uncle! -Huh? There is a lot of gap between these two trees. We must plant a tree here. For all the trees you planted, you deserve a Doctorate, Guru. Doctor reminds me. -What is his name? -Satya. I want to see him. Hello! Hello, hero! What? Only whistle Mahalakshmi’s name is famous in this town till now. Now Satya’s will become famous too. You are the talk of the town. I spoke about you on FM as well. Hey, why do you do that? Was that necessary? Hello, whistle! Your programme is super. Okay. I need to discuss something important with you. Where are you? I am going to Kondareddy Bastion. Tell me. Stay right there. I will come and tell you directly. Tell me. You wanted to say something. About that? It’s… The whole town is talking about you. It’s about that. But you already said that over the phone. You mentioned something important… I will tell you later. Okay. Huh? Huh? Did you call me? No. Did you call me? No! No one ventures to come before me. But you had the audacity to confront me! I always send my men. But the town is echoing with the name of ‘Satya’. That’s why I came personally. You are not able to retaliate at all! Huh? How dare you look me in the eye? Hey, doctor! You are not able to protect yourself! How will you save the town? Only one name should resonate here. It’s Guru! Ancestors are great people, doctor. They said no one knows how death comes. How right they are! Huh? You came all the way from Hyderabad to die at my hands. A man should live either on his strength or in fear. But you lack both. That’s why you are dying now. Water! Huh? What is it? Water. Water! Will anybody here give him water? Huh? Huh? No one. Water! It’s been two years since it rained properly in this town. The trees I planted are withering. For you to survive…rain… it will rain. Hey, move! Attention, please! Hey! Check whether he is there or not. Okay, Guru! Hey! Search! I told him, madam. I told him strongly not to meddle with Guru. But he didn't listen. He didn’t listen. I can see something in his eyes. His anger looks different. They are looking for him everywhere. If he is found, he is done for. No. Take him and go away, madam. Let him just live. Let him stay alive. I brought my son as a doctor to this town. Now I am taking him back as a patient. The name Kurnool Guru is familiar across the two Telugu states. Hey! It’s about brother. Having gone to jail for a murder he committed as a minor, Guru has now reached the stage of dictating Kurnool. He has also entered politics recently. -I threatened Gangireddy. He has finally agreed. Brother, you are all over the TV. -with the highest position, To discuss this topic we have senior leader Mr Adusumilli Venkatrao. Greetings, Mr Venkatarao! Greetings, madam. Tell us, Mr Venkatarao. How should we look at this? Look, madam. Anyone can be given a post these days. Nothing surprising about it. If you have money at home and cases in the court, you can occupy any position. But I am not going to keep quiet. If he is given a portfolio, I am ready to fast to death in front of our party office. Just as a bloodsucker matures into a chameleon, it is proved that a rowdy ends up being a politician. As someone who was steering illegal occupations and numerous settlements, what atrocities he might unleash after becoming MLA? He kills a person and plants a tree. And when you look at the trees Guru planted, you see a garden. You must teach such people a strong lesson. She has made a video of our plants. She has edited half of our violent stories. Let’s show her the remaining half directly. Abduct the angel, uncle. Hey! Stop! Hey, catch her. Hey! Hey, doctor! Are all your wounds healed? Huh? Why are you here again? Have you forgotten something? Hey! He ran away and hid himself. And you are hiding behind him? We beat him to pulp and dangled him at Kondareddy Bastion. He couldn’t defend himself. How can he save you now? Hey! Get her. "He’s a survivor" "He’s a survivor" "He’s a fighter" "He’s a fighter" "He is not going to give up" "Because he’s a warrior" Attention, please! I, Satya... You are the top candidate in the training so far. Do you have an option in your mind regarding the place of your posting? Kurnool! A doctor who knows surgery is back as a policeman. Tell them he will castigate if they cross the line. Tell them when he strikes, the pulse metre will break unable to read your pulse as you run. It's a different story in the past. Now that I set foot here, it's a different story now. It's not Satya, MBBS now. It’s Satya, IPS! This town suffers from a strange illness. And it needs unique treatment. Operation start! -Guru! -Hmm. The doctor is back. He arrested our men. How can a doctor make an arrest? He is not a doctor now. He is back as a policeman. When someone blocks the way, go forward crushing them. Let his heart stop. Our vehicle shouldn't, Subbarao. Move. Hey, stop right there. Why did you come here? What is your business here? I sent two of my men. You refused to speak to them. That’s why I came personally. Yo! I am not contesting to win. But to make you lose. If necessary, I will talk to the High Command. As long as I am alive, I will not let you get a seat. Guru! Now that I am entering politics, I am learning how to back stab. -Hey! -Guru! You were saying something. About some doctor and police? What was that? I didn’t pay proper attention. -Same guy, Guru! -Hmm. The one whom you suspended in air at the bastion? The same doctor. He became a policeman and is posted in our town. It’s common for a rowdy to become a politician. How does a doctor turn into a policeman? Very novel. The game sounds good. Let’s play. Hey! Woo… "My lord, brave lord Come to me, lord" -Devaraj! -Huh? -Sir! -What happened? Why are all those I arrested jumping outside? Who released them? It’s not even a day! One day? It’s not even half a day, sir. They were here and they were gone in a blink. They are Guru’s men, sir. How can we put them in the cell? Huh? I am the higher officer of this station. Why didn’t you inform me before releasing them? There are officers above you, sir. We have no option but to take their orders. As if you don’t know that! This is what happens when doctors become policemen. -Go, get the baton. -Sir! Hey! Wait! Sir! You don’t know about Guru’s men. It’s dangerous to beat them. I said get the baton! Sir, please listen to me. If they come, neither this station will stand nor do we. -All hell will break loose. -Sir! Vermilion and flowers! Is this your wife? It was for weapon veneration. We are not given batons to worship . But to honour thugs with them. Watch me honour them now. Sir! Listen to me. Don't mess with Guru’s men. He is very dangerous. Sir, please listen to me. I say this for your own good. Sir! You will end up facing problems! Oh my! Alas… Why are you hitting me, sir? Sir! Alas! Why are you hitting me? Because you are also Guru’s man. Oh my! -Srinivasan! -Sir! There are forty pigeons on a tree. Shoot one of them and how many remain? 39, sir. What is this, Srinivasan? You know the story for years and yet you give a wrong answer. Huh? All of them will fly away. That is the answer. SP sir! Sir! Sir, sir! See how badly he beat me as soon as he took charge, sir. Hey! Who are you? Who gave you the appointment letter? Just because you have a revolver, you will start shooting? How dare you touch a policeman, rascal! Are you trying to be a hero? Huh? Now show your heroism before the SP. Sir! Government pays you to serve the public. Not to wash Guru’s underwear. With three lions on your head, are you not ashamed to live like a dog? It’s people like you who make those wastrels so brazen. -Srinivasan! -Sir? -Give me the fax. -Okay, sir. You are already suspended. This has all the evidence of your corrupt income, assets and gold. I first got the orders to take action against my junior or senior and then I took the posting at Kurnool. To make water stay in the bucket, its holes have to be sealed first. To keep the rowdies under control, people like you should be contained. -Officers! -Sir! Hands that salute should always stay high. Crime should be under our control. Any man who is guilty should be behind bars. Be it a rowdy or a policeman. -Srinivasan! -Sir. -Start the vehicle. Hi, hello, welcome, Namaste. This is your whistle Mahalakshmi. Tell me. Which song would you like to hear? I am Satya speaking. Can you play a song from the film ‘Satya’? Certainly no. -I have to make a public announcement. Make arrangements. -Okay, sir! Maha! We need to stop the show right now. Police are here. They need to make some public announcement. -My show is on air. -No. We have to give way. -They are waiting. -Why? -We need to understand. -I mean… So far you might have heard film songs or cricket score on FM. But for the first time, I came here to say something in your interest. Please spare me two minutes of your time. I am Satya. I had come to this town as a doctor. When I faced a problem and went to complain, it was ignored. That’s why I came back into a place I can take action from. I have just taken charge as Deputy Superintendent of Police. Kurnool! No one could question the wrongs done here. Now, I am here. You don’t have to be scared of anyone. K-4 Police Station, Madhur Nagar. Don’t take it as a brick building painted in red. It is a second address of your home. Consider me your family, like a brother, as one of your own. One complaint… Just one complaint… As soon as it’s given, I am ready to take action. Otherwise, I am ready to remove my cap and walk away. Whether I am in uniform or not I shall be on duty round the clock. And my dear gangsters! This is my final warning to you! Reform if possible. Or run. If anyone tries to get unlawful, I will chase him and cut his tail. Hey! Do our men have tails? Huh? Thank God! I don’t have one. I have escaped. But then… Who will complain against us? No one will, sir. Who has the guts? Hey, do any of you have the guts? [SATYA, I.P.S] Er… I mean… we can’t say. Since you spoke on the radio, someone might gather the courage and come forward to complain, sir. Sir, I want to lodge a complaint. Whom do I meet? Complaint? Hey, come here. What is it? Complaint against whom? Come, sit down. It’s okay, sir. It’s okay. Sit down. Tell me. Who is the complaint against? Will my family be safe, sir? I hope you won’t let me down after taking the complaint? -What is your name? -My name is Babu, sir. Babu, if I let you down after registering your complaint, I am as good as dead. Tell me without any fear. I have lots of complaints, sir. Basically, I have diabetes complaint. 60 on fasting and 230 after eating, sir. I am troubled by frequent urination, sir. I love to eat sweets but I am not able to, sir. I am finding it very difficult, sir. I am not able to walk properly. I have foot corns, sir. I feel weak on one side. I have many such complaints, sir. Sir! If you have a tablet for all these, please give it to me, sir. Give me, sir. Hey! Be a doctor and we will refer ten such cases every day to you. You cannot change the local law by changing your shirt. Hey! Guru is the law maker here. Guru stands for ferocity. Guru spreads fear. Hmm. What did you think? Hey, Deva! At least, you could have told him! By the way, I heard you are good at shooting? Come, come. Shoot me here. Shoot me here. Come, come, shoot me here! Shoot me here. Shoot me here. Come, come. Shoot me here. Shoot me here. You feel like laughing, don’t you? It’s okay. Go ahead and laugh. He didn’t mock at me alone. He mocked at the entire department. Have you ever done justice to your uniform or your salary? The sight of a constable on a cycle was enough to scatter goons earlier. It’s the other way round now. An elephant that doesn’t know its strength begs at a shack. You collect money from every corner and hence this situation. Hey! Who are you? Why do you serve tea here in stead of going to school? The poor boy cannot speak, sir. He can’t hear either. I can speak, sir. I heard your speech on the radio, sir. I am not here to serve tea, sir. I have come to lodge a complaint. Complaint? Against whom? Tell me. My dad worked as a driver for Guru, sir. They killed my dad, sir. I went to meet my father because he said he would buy me a bicycle, sir. Guru’s men stabbed someone to death right before my eyes, sir. Hey, look who it is. My father begged them. So, they spared me, sir. I am scared, dad. Balu's son saw it, Guru. Kill him! They mistook my younger brother for me and took him away. Dad! Dad! They are taking away brother thinking it’s me. Hey, hey, stop! My father went there for my brother. Son… Sir… They killed my father along with my brother, sir. I saw it. -Dad! I heard he has another son. Hmm. He is dumb, Guru. He is deaf too. Since then I have been pretending to be my brother who cannot speak. I live this life only to survive. You were not dumb alone. This whole town has been dumb. Now that you started speaking, the entire town will begin to talk. -Can you identify your dad’s killer? -I can, sir. Come. He is the one, sir. He spoke on the radio yesterday. I thought he is like the rest of them. He is different. He is a true police officer. May his mother be blessed wherever she is. How is this great? The police are only doing their duty. Why do you praise them for that? You have no idea, madam. They are all hard core criminals. Someone has come to tackle them. Till now the town has been convulsing with contractions. It feels as if a boy is born now. Hey! Stop there. Mom, mom! Sorry, mom. Stay right there. Don't come in. I had some important work. I had to arrest a thug. That’s why I couldn’t make it to the railway station. I said don’t come inside! Wait! Stop there. Hmm. Go back. What is all this? The whole town is talking about my son. Did you hear? No. I saw it. I am proud. Spare no one. If anyone enters the area, inform us immediately. -Srinivasan, tell them to bring quickly. -Okay, sir. -You are Srinivasan, right? -Yes. Sir, you had asked me to come. Find out why I was called and tell me so I can go. -I’m busy … -Srinivasan! I gave you a job. -What is the discussion over there? -Sorry, sir. Sir, sir! Just because he changed his shirt, how can he forget everything? What do I do now? -Should I sit crying? -What? Why are you grumbling to yourself? Then? What else can I do? After you left, when people asked me for a folk song, I played them a sad song. I am not even able to whistle! Only air! I had everything in my life back then. You took everything with you. You left me with nothing. Look here. Look at my face. You came to my station. I set the mike for you. Once… just once… did you try to look at me? I did. Dark blue jeans, white T-shirt and a denim shirt on top. You let your hair down. You always wear a hairband on your wrist… so cute… it was missing. You noticed all that? How? A policeman has his eyes even at the back. Sir! Give it to madam. You ordered this for me? You still remember I like black coffee? Do you know something? Whenever I heard a whistle at the training, or a cuckoo so much as a cooker at home, I was reminded of you. How could I forget you? Really? Swear? By the way... when we last met, you wanted to tell me something. Tell me now. You still remember that? After two years? Two years, three months and eight days. Including today. How? Leave that. Tell me at least now. Actually… On the radio I talk for two hours on what I can say in two words. But… Even those two words are stuck here. Hey! I have been playing songs for the others till now. Shall I play a song for myself today? A DSP song for this DSP? "When you come closer, my heart beats faster" "When you touch me, my blood goes hot" "When you sit on my bike, it refuses a brake" "When you go with me for a ride, the red signal turns green" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Hey, like twenty-twenty match this travel feels thrilling" "Like winning the world cup your kiss has given me a kick" "Bus…lorry….car... push them all aside" "Our bike is super-cute and it’s a two wheeled flight" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Riding on the highway, let’s stop at an ice-cream parlour" "Let’s take a selfie with a kulfi" "Hey, as if there is no more morrow let’s today roam around" "In one single day, let’s go round the world" "Even though it’s midnight let’s switch on the headlight" "Let’s put on the helmet and zoom fast with a new head weight" "Let’s lean on the seat and fulfil small desires" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" "Hand in hand, let’s make Insta reels" "Let’s update our status to would-be" "Let’s find a corner at a horror film" "Let’s hug tight when it gets scary" "On the hot silencer, let’s make an omelette" "This is a new route for our romantic appetite" "Let’s vroom and roam celebrating this ride" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "While on the way, let’s sing a duet" "Come on, baby! Let’s go on the Bullet" "On the way, let’s sing a duet" Okay, bye! [DR RAHIM, DEAN] Rahim sir! How are you? Long time. I want to meet our Dean, Mr Robert. Robert sir? But he died in an accident. What do you mean, sir? Yes, sir. He met with an accident and died. Don’t try to swallow truth with a glass of water. I know what an accident means in this hospital. When you know it’s a lie, why do you ask me again and again? We are not brave like you to replace the doctor’s coat with a khaki shirt. I have a family. One kg of tomatoes please. -Half kg of okra. -Guru bro, greetings. How come you are here? -How are you? -I am good, brother. -Bro, sit. -Carry on. Carry on. One kg potato… -Namaste, madam. -Ah. That one ... This one too! -That one as well. -My name is Guru. You should have given some sense to your son. He is making mistake after mistake. He was supposed to die that day. He missed it by a hair. If he stands in my way again, I will sever his head and throw it in Tungabhadra. Are you Guru? I wanted to meet you. Do you know something? His dad wanted him to be a doctor. I wanted him to become a policeman. Brother Guru! Namaste! When you hit him that day, his clothes were different. His education was different. Today, his education is different and his uniform is different. I already told him not to spare any wrongdoer. Do you know why we named him Satya? We wanted him to always stand up for truth. He reopened just one case. It dragged you to the market. Once the bullet is out of the barrel, no one can stop it. I don’t know if I will ever see you again. Take care of yourself. Give me the bag. Move aside. She belongs to the brave women category. Vijayashanti in movies? -Hmm. That type. She has to see her son die. Let her live till then. Waste fax. Waste of paper. Sir! -Devraj! -Sir! What is that? Nothing, sir. Just formalities. They are regular. We get enquiry from other states if their thugs are in our zone. Why will they be here, sir? Remove it. No point, sir. I said remove it. Take out all the files and records of criminals from other states. I threw them because they were useless, sir. -You threw them? -Sir! I have filed them, sir. ‘I hear a defiant tone. Who is it?’ Unless someone is feeding them, there won’t be so many pigeons. -Devraj! -Sir? See how easy the cell phones made our job? Information on a number of calls from a single number to other states given by control room led us here. Why did you leave everyone behind and bring me along, sir? Sir! What is this, sir? You have ruined us. Oh my! Oh no! Who is that? Sir, they are too many in number. Let me go and get the force. You are the Force. From the day you put on your uniform, you have never done your duty. Do it now once for all. What? I am the Force? Oh my! Sir, what is this, sir? Stop it, sir. We will be seen. That’s the plan. You want to be seen? Sir! Sir, they are all carrying weapons. Let's start firing sir! Don’t use weapons. I need them all alive. Don't shoot? Hey, Anji! Showri! Look around. Oh, no! They are targeting me. Sir, sir, sir! Oh my! -Devraj! -Sir! You might have watched Pan-India films. Have you seen Pan-India thugs? Inform the concerned stations. -Send them all to their own states. -Okay, sir! Whose name is this building in? -Hey, my picture should look good. -Brother, please smile a bit! Brother, brother! Smile a little. Brother, brother! Just a little. Yes, yes. Hey, move! -Capture that pose. -Guru! -Hmm. Satya attacked our forest guest-house and abducted all our men. What are we going to do now? Huh? Not what are we going to do. Ask me what you should do. The moment I decided to enter politics, I transferred all my illegal businesses to your name. Find a bed in some hospital on the pretext of a heart attack. While there, try writing Ramakoti. Don't flirt with nurses. Rest of the it… -Huh? -I will take care. When I have a heart attack, there is nothing he can do. Let’s take some rest! Doctor is coming on his rounds. Please stay quiet. Okay! Is everything ready? Have you taken the signature from his blood relatives? Give the patient anaesthesia. Get ready for the surgery. -Okay, sir! Surgery? Hey! Are you a real doctor or fake? Surgery, he says. He knows nothing. Fake people find everything fake. -Check him. -Okay, sir! What’s that look? I made you run only to check your heart beat and pulse rate. Going by your speed, you must be quite fit. You could have dodged a normal policeman with your heart attack. But I am a doctor. And I am a policeman as well. Doctor-Police! Get in! He may have put Mannar and Ravi behind the bars. I am Guru. Every blow I delivered will be in his mind and heart. He won’t come after me so quickly. He is coming, brother! Hey! Like school kids complaining to their teacher, I heard you complained to my mom? I am ready to take your complaint. You could have come to the station. Acting like a kid! Before a major surgery, Sugar and BP should be controlled. Mannar is your sugar. Ravi is your BP. Both are under control. Next, it’s you. From the moment I put on the police uniform, I'm sure you never slept. Your eyes are red and you have dark circles. It’s okay. I will prescribe a strong sleeping pill. You will be set. Damn! Clonafit. They don’t give you this over the counter. They demand a doctor’s prescription. Ask him to take it and sleep well. He won't sleep afterwards anyway. Hey! Your blow is here… and here. Yes! "He’s a survivor" "He’s a survivor" "He’s a fighter" "He’s a fighter" "He is not going to give up" "Because he’s a warrior" "He’s a survivor" "He’s a fighter" "He is not going to give up" "Because he’s a warrior" Brother, forget the bull. Set a lion upon him, and the same thing will happen. Police station news for all of you from radio station. Ever saw a perfect police officer warning and arresting the same day? No wrong doer can escape, boss. Ongole bull and Haryana Ox! But I am not talking of bulls. You all know who I am talking about. You must have seen Pawan Kalyan in 'Gabbar Singh'. And Mahesh Babu in 'Pokiri'. Also NTR in 'Temper'. Of course, Surya in 'Yamudu'. One such sensational officer has come to Kurnool. I am really very proud. He deserves a whistle and also a song. Shall we give him both? I am already feeling hot and drinking water. Who is she? She is adding fuel! Is Ravi's charge sheet ready? Two constables are on the job, sir. -I hope there are no loopholes? -Reports are expected in two days. Hello! Hi, hello, Namaste. I am your whistle Mahalakshmi. It’s so hot, Guru! Your favourite song only for you. ‘Come… move nearer to come closer" How are you, man? You took two of my men. Let them go. I will leave her. If you take them to the court, you won’t hear her whistle on FM. I will slit her throat. I guess he didn't like the song. He will tremble and make a call back. -He will. -Guru! Kurnool is ours. You always whistle on the radio. Do it now. Hey! Did you understand what the girl said? She says some guy will come and he will kill us all. Put all your phones on the table. No one should attend phone calls. -Uncle! -Hmm? -Call up Devaraj. -Okay! Devaraj is not picking up. -The girl is with us, right? -Yes! Check once. Hey, is the girl in our vehicle? Brother, she is in our vehicle. Don’t stop the vehicle. Keep it going round. Okay, brother. Careful. Careful. Order for tea. -Brother, there is no trouble here. -Uh-huh! Four teas are sent in. Is it so? Okay. Guru! Tea has gone into the station. There is no other reaction. Where is my son? He has gone to school. Who is with him? Er… Giri went with him. -Call him and ask him to check. -Okay! -Hello! -Hey! How long to answer the phone? Where is the boy? Right here at the school. He is taking an exam. No exam. Nothing. Go in and check right now. -Okay, brother! -First get the boy home. -Ask him to come! Tell him! Where is Swarna? Where is she? Call her. Call her quickly, uncle. [CHANTING] What happened? She is not picking up. Hey, call Gopi or Sundar. Call them. No one is picking up, Guru. Hello! What happened? Why so many missed calls? Why so long to answer? Where are you? -Where are you? -Hey, stop it! Where are you? Why so long to answer? The astrologer said bad phase has started in your life. I came to the temple to perform a ritual. Don’t talk. Just come home. There is no problem there, right? You are safe, right? Of course, I am safe. They are offering diamond necklace on discount. I will go shopping and come. Hey, hey, hey! No diamond and nothing. We have a knife at our throats. You want a necklace? Come home! -Come home. Don’t say anything. -It’s not that. What is this? We are the abductors. Why are you getting tensed? He is the one who should worry. Guru! It’s a pigeon. Don't worry. It’s not a good omen. Ask them to let her go. -Guru! -Let her go! -Hey! -Brother? Free the girl and come away. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. -What? We are leaving her. We are coming back. -Hey, turn the vehicle. -What happened? - Do it. Come on. -I am doing it! Guru! Are you scared? Where are you? In front of FM station. They left me exactly where they kidnapped me from. -Stay right there. I am coming. -Okay. Maha! Nothing happened to you? -All safe? -Damn safe. What did you do? Did you bash them up? I knew this would happen. Whom did they kidnap? Deputy Superintendent of Police’s girl. I guess you gave them the jitters. What did you do? Nothing. Huh? You did nothing? Isn't there a Plan B at least? Hey! Are you the end card entry police? Why do you say you did nothing? How? The best medicine for some diseases is no medicine. Silence is the biggest violence in the world. Hey, police! So you thought like a doctor! Your treatment is super. Operation successful and the patient has survived. Now and then doing nothing is okay. But now I want to do something. What’s that? "Hey, fold your tongue, join fingers and blow it holding your breath" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Hey, with a torch for the eyes and scotch for the lips" "Appears cute beauty" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Your breath is fragrant like perfume" "Your swears are sweet like a poem" "Your painted nails are like rainbows in the sky" "Describing your beauty is like solving a puzzle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Your looks've hooked me to you beauty, your looks get a whistle" "Your touch switches me on and that sweet touch gets a whistle" "When you are hot and I am naughty my breath gives out a whistle" "Your tough gym body heats up my body and I blow you a whistle within me" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "On my day off, I am back from office and find you in two-piece with a whistle" "I wake up when you are in my dream to find you in my room that’s a whistle" "When I find your waist that a microscope cannot detect" "The moment deserves a whistle" "When you hug me like a cheeky guy, Like a cooker I blow the whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" "Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" Whistle…whistle…whistle…whistle" When one of our former colleagues returns as an IPS and achieves this... it makes us proud, right? -Guru deserves a man like this. -Hmm. I bashed him up and hung him. But you treat him and help him live? Where is he? Huh? Go away with him. Stop looking for him. It's for your own good. Come out. How did he die? Accident. Write the postmortem! Hello! Sir! This is Rahim speaking. Tell me. When you asked me the other day, I couldn’t say anything. But when I see what you are doing, I have developed faith in you. Our Dean had saved so many lives. Everyone should know how he lost his life. I have all the proofs with me. I am in a medical camp now. I will bring them to you tomorrow, sir. Thank you, doctor. Sir! We got the orders to conduct re-postmortem on the Dean. Good things are happening together. Good. Sir! What, police? Can you hear the sound of death? Huh? Are you wondering how Rahim came up when you were digging for Robert? If you dig deeper, you will find Ram too. I don’t care about religion when I murder. Forgetting your police job, why are you busy with post mortems? Huh? Wherever a police dog roams in this town, I will bloody know. What? Why are you dead silent? Only one sound should be heard here. Guru! I am going to file my nomination tomorrow. Come and be a part of my security! I am sure you won’t sleep now. You were mentioning some tablet the other day? What fit? Clonafit! You are a doctor. You don’t need a prescription. Take a tablet and sleep in peace. Good night! With bad dreams! Hey! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! -Brother Guru! -Long live! -Brother Guru! -Long live! -Brother Guru! -Long live! -Brother Guru! -Long live! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! -Future MLA, brother Guru! -Long live! Hey! Hey! Who is it? Hey! Hey! Hey, I said no. The town will burn. Let’s see who will burn it! Come! Hey! What is this? Huh? What the hell is happening? You have the audacity to arrest Guru? You don’t know what will happen if you arrest brother Guru. This town will burn down. If you don’t release brother Guru, I will crush everyone. What do you think? You will crush us all? Whom will you crush, scoundrel? Hey! Bloody rogue! Hey! I will kill you, Idiot! Hey! If anyone comments on the police, I will flay them. Bloody rogues! Have police become a joke for you? Move! There should be absolutely no disturbance in this city. Station patrol vehicles everywhere. If anyone tries to show off break their bones and arrest them. I will take care of it, sir. Not even a fly will go in or come out of the station, sir. I am on duty, sir. -Devraj! -Sir! Today your uniform fits you. Keep this. Thank you, sir. A1 calling, sir. I am calling from the Flower Market area. Everything is clear, sir. Sir, I am calling from the Venkateswara swamy Temple. No problem here, sir. All our men are standing in their positions. There is no problem here sir, over. Sir, calling from the old Kota center. Everything is under control sir, over. Yo! Are you a pick-pocket? Local or outstation? Pass me that water bottle. Why don’t you say something? What case are you caught in? This police torture has become unbearable. They used to be silent. Now they are violently locking us up. Earlier it was easy to enter the fair and pick pockets in no time. Some Satya has taken charge recently. Bah! Oh, my! But one thing about him. Whenever he beats you, he gives you painkillers. He flogs and gives you a tablet. He flogs and gives you a tablet. He flogs and gives a tablet. Oh, my! I don’t understand whether this is a police station or a hospital. Do you notice that to the wall? First aid box? That’s for us. Remember. Yo! Do you know Guru? He is a very big rowdy. He is my inspiration. This guy doesn’t let him sleep. Imagine. You should behave yourself. Huh? Ah? My ear hasn’t been working for two days. But I can clearly hear the sound of his shoe. He is coming. Let’s sleep silently and say nothing. Okay? What, brother? It must be long since you saw the world through the bars? Are you recalling your childhood memories? What did you say? The city would burn if we caught you? Not even a match stick was lit. At every step through my training, I remembered the way you beat me. I was restless to take the posting, report in Kurnool and put you here- this is the day I have been waiting for. Guru means fear. Guru means bravery. Guru is that. Guru is this. Wow, wow! What build up! Huh? All that at one go- Hey! You asked me for security, didn’t you? Tomorrow when I take you to the court, I will provide you all the security. Hey! Do you know my husband? He beheaded someone at the age of 14. Someone took such a man dragging on the roads. These are all our property documents. Take whatever you want. By tomorrow morning, the policeman’s head should be here. Why at this hour, mom? Not sleeping? Where are you? I am on night patrol. It’s nothing. I guess you arrested Guru. The news is on TV. I am not able to sleep. Nothing to worry, mom. Everything is safe. -Have your dinner and go to bed. I will be home soon. -Hey! I don’t have to tell you to be brave. But I must caution you. I feel weird. If there is some shop close by, drink a glass of water and go. Mom! What is all this? I told you to do something. Okay. Go to sleep. Hmm. Hey, Police! Follow me. Hey! Maha, wait! He escaped! Hey! Some girl has fallen. Mahalakshmi! Look! Nothing will happen to you. Nothing. Hey! Hey, no! Sit. Hey! Who was that? You will be fine. Mahalakshmi! Open your eyes. Look at me! Maha! Nothing will happen to you. Hey, stop! Take that bandage. Her throat is deeply cut. But she is out of danger. Her vocal chords are deeply cut. So we are not sure if she can speak like before. As a doctor, you are aware of everything. I have interviewed lots of celebrities recently. But those celebrities were my fans. -So, are they interviewing me or am I- -Hey! Why do you keep prattling? Not even a little gap? Hey! Why are you stifling my voice? If I stop talking, I feel dead. Hi, hello, welcome, Namaste. Sir! Guru is released, sir. What do you mean? You should be surprised if he is still inside. It's no surprise he got out, sir. -Hey, hey! What are you doing? -Leave me! Wait! -Wait! -I said leave! I said leave! Should I kill him now? When he was arrested and dragged on the road, he was half dead. In our families, we don’t kill a corpse. Hmm. Damn! I severed his father’s head and made the whole town shiver. I grew up along with their fear. He destroyed that fear. The one who came to kill me belittled my death. Is their fear gone? Guru! They can never stop fearing us. Already, I sent our men. They will come back with his head by tomorrow morning. No! I should cut him from top to bottom myself. I will roam the town with his dead body on my shoulder and create fear again. No one should touch him. I will kill the rogue myself. Sir! He may come here any moment. It’s not safe for you to stay here. Let’s shift the place. I am worried for your family,sir. Why are you scared? Are you all police? My son removed his white coat and put on the khaki shirt, not to take his monthly pay and salute everyone. But to correct the wrongs here. When he was born, he didn’t cry. His father, the doctors, everyone was worried. But I didn’t worry a bit. My son was not born to cry. He was born to wipe others' tears. If you are afraid, remove your uniform and find some other job. You say Guru will do anything? Only as long as he is in jail, you are bound by law. The moment he stepped out, he has crossed the boundary line. If he has no limits, my son has no limits either. Courage is not in retaliation to someone who came after you. It is in finding them and striking them first. By the time the sun rises tomorrow, this city should be clean with no garbage. Go. Hey, stop! Hey? Move! This is between him and me. At the same spot. Let’s start where we stopped. Come. You bloody! Your death is in my hands. Let’s see right now whose death is at whose hands. Come on! Hey! Come on! Come on! Hey! This is Guru! This is Satya! I am not a doctor anymore to fall when you beat. Police! -Guru! -Brother! -Guru! Guru! Get up! Come on! I will hang you up again. It's the same place. I was in your place. You were in mine. Our places have changed! Are you thirsty? You must want to beg for water? For the anger I feel, for the horrible things you've done, I want to empty my gun into your head. But the doctor in me is telling me from some corner- ‘Don’t take a life.’ Even now if someone from the crowd here takes pity on you and brings you to me… as a doctor, I shall be ready to save you.
