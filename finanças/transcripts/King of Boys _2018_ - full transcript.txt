Bite the table! -Sir! -Bite the table! -Bite that thing! -Bite the table! -Harder! Hard! -[groans] Oh, damn! This guy has lost his teeth, Listen up, The person who sees something, but doesn't say anything will get the worst punishment, -Makanaki! -No problem, How many are there? It's four, His gap-tooth is wider now, [Kemi] How can he still be in that meeting? Did you tell him Alhaja Salami is the one that needs to speak with him? Simon? Simon, He hung up the phone on me, Bastard, [scoffs] I can't get ahold of Mr, Onitiri, He's not picking up my phone calls or returning my text messages, Kitan, could you give me like ten minutes?

Get up from that table! What is the matter with you, Kitan? Must you query me every time I speak with you? How many sons give their parents trouble the way you give me? [in Yoruba] Are you doing drugs again? Get out! Wow, Mum, don't you think that was a bit too harsh? I don't give a damn, Kemi, I think the governor and Aare,,, I suspect they think I have something to do with those robberies, Okay, Mum, we may be overthinking things, I mean, surely they know you wouldn't jeopardize your relationship with them, Also, they know that things like this cannot happen without my consent, So what, this was some kind of retaliation for the ministerial snub? Korede wants to ruin me, -Mum? -Yes? Makanaki has been overreaching for a while now and I keep telling you that we need to send him a strong warning, You're taking him too lightly and its making us look weak and afraid, Weak? [in Yoruba] The slow crawling of a lion is not out of fear, And you also taught me,,, [in Yoruba] The ram that moves backwards has gone to summon more power, [in English] Kemi, organize a round table meeting, Kitan! Kitan, darling! Hello? Can you please come back to the table and finish your meal? [Aare] Don't tell me that you are doing everything you can, I just lost 45 million dollars that I cannot report to the authorities, [man] We are on it, sir, But we have to proceed with caution, Eniola is a dangerous adversary, Eniola? [in Yoruba] When a slave turns on its master, it gets killed, Sir? -My friend, go and get the thing done! -Noted, sir, Hold on, hold on, Yes? The pilot said the jet is ready, Okay, I'm coming, And let us get Ebele out of prison before he begins-- [in Yoruba] Before he starts to sing like a canary, [in Yoruba] What's going on? Boys! Boys! Let's go let's go! [in Pidgin] Hey, Do you realize you are in the hood? What's going on? You think you can come here without paying the fee? You must pay! Who do you think you are?

The next time I see you, you must not be pregnant, I don't want to see you pregnant, Do you understand? -If your husband tries to touch you-- -[man] Karimotu! I am talking, If your husband tries to touch you, look for a nice stick and hit his head, [in Yoruba] Have you heard? [men shouting] Clear the road! "You want to do dinner, lunch?" She's like, "No, come over," I'm like, "Lady, I'm with my younger brother," She said, "No! Go drop him off and come alone," Lanre! Lanre! Minister of lies, Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, This is the problem I have with you, No one can even tell you anything, Okay, okay, one quick question, You're telling me the same babe we always see dating big boys, Lagos big boys, private jet having mofos, came to you, Lanre, who can't even get her a bicycle, and said, "Come over alone," -I don't-- I don't-- -Get outta here, man! Shit! The problem is that he thinks that money can buy happiness, That's what he thinks, You're deluding yourself, Some of us have swag, Some of us know the kinds of things we tell these girls, And I'm not bragging, Dude, I told her, I said, "Look, if I come over,,," -See that lady over there? -Yes, sir, Give her anything she wants from the menu, It's on me, -[whooping] -KT! KT for the money! Mm! London swag, [in Pidgin] This London swag you're trying here won't work, The girls will eat, wipe their mouths, and say bye, Calm down, Just calm down, My brother, my brother, see, When I got there and she opened the door, she was the freaking 15 out of 10, She said she appreciates the offer, but she will have to decline, And to say thank you for being thoughtful, she's paid for all the food and drink you and your friends have consumed, -Oh! -[groans] And that you're welcome, -Oh, Oh, my God, -Oh! -Fine baby girl: 10, KT: 0, -Oh, my God, -Oh, KT, oh, my God, -That's painful, -It's all right, my brother, -That's painful, that's painful, She has finished you, -He might as well go to his casket, -Aunty,,, Well done, ma'am, Good try, [in Yoruba] Stop crying, The first time is always the hardest, After a while, it gets easier, I feel this way sometimes, too, But when I shut my eyes, I find myself somewhere else, -Where? -In my mind, Stop crying, Sorry, -Do you understand English? -I understand, but I can't speak it, -That's okay, First, what is your name? -Eniola, I'll teach you how to speak in English, Just repeat after me, [in English] My name is Eniola, My name is Eniola, Nice to meet you, My name is Bunmi, -[flute playing] -[chattering] [no audible dialogue] [man chattering] Thank you, Akorede is not here, Anyway,,, [in Yoruba] To avoid thorns from poking you in the eyes,,, you observe them from a safe distance, [in English] Thank you for coming once again, I know you're very busy people, But I must call this emergency meeting before things get out of hand, Nothing moves,,, I repeat, nothing moves in Lagos without you people at this table, As the head of this table, I know I have been fair to this association, But today I am not happy! God forbid! God forbid! You are happy in Jesus' name, No, Apostle, how can I be happy? When some small rat wants to eat and destroy everything I,,, everything we all worked for, [man] I will be rat, Now that we have a full table, can we address-- Akorede, we are mates now, right? That I have to wait for you, [in Yoruba] What a pity, what a pity, what a pity, You have taken your finger, dipped it in hot pepper and poked your mother in the eye with it, My name is Makanaki and I don't have a mother, [in Pidgin] Maka, respect the crown, What is wrong with you? What crown are you talking about? You all fear a lion that has lost its claws and teeth, Old glory, old school, A mother who can't take care of her children, She's making money from politics, [in English] She has no time for us, When last has anyone at this table benefited from this woman? Huh? Answer, Raise hands, Apostle? Huh? Otunba, sir? You? But she wants to come back here and share from our hustle again, She wants to be king at this table, [in Yoruba] Mama, your era has passed, Drop the mantle, [in English] Release the crown, Jesus of Nazareth! Apostle, that is not from Jesus,,, or your king, It's from Makanaki, And Odogwu Malay, -Tell them the facts, -Facts, Well,,, [clears throat] Um, what is done is done, Mummy, we cannot reverse what has been done, But I'm glad that Makanaki respects our rules enough to make sure the king has her share, No, no, Everybody at this table has an equal share, Who's a king? Maki! Her cut is 40, after everything else, [in Yoruba] She's not my king, [in English] She's not my king, [Eniola laughs] [in Yoruba] They say a child doesn't recognize a deadly herb, so he calls it a vegetable The elders spoke that proverb, Little ones, where were you when I started? Look at me, Akorede, [in English] Sitting in this chair as the head of this table,,, It's not by mistake, Your weak, late uncle, who you inherited that seat from should have told you, No worries, [in Yoruba] The whip that was used for the first wife is available for the second wife, It seems that that crown on your head is starting to drive you crazy, Makanaki, is something wrong with you? [in English] What sort of insult is that? If you cannot respect the crown, respect her age, [in Pidgin] Your blood's too hot, Calm down, Yorubas say: [in Yoruba] "May God deliver us from evil," You thought that prayer was about sickness? Disease? Or death? That prayer was about me, I am evil incarnate, God's worst punishment in a person! -And when I rain,,, -No, no, no, Eniola, no! [in Yoruba] They say, one's child cannot be so bad that he is offered to the Lion as food, And? You think am afraid of God? [in Pidgin] Keep quiet, Why do you talk like this? You don't fear God? Don't you know that God sees everything that's happening here? You will upset Him, Only God can settle all these problems going on here, What is wrong with you? That is the problem, Any small thing: "God, God, God," You are all afraid of a God you have never seen, [in Pidgin] You really should fear me as I sit here, but you don't, Hmm? [in Yoruba] If only you could see inside me, you would know how dark my heart is, -Akorede, -Hmm? -You want my crown? -Yes, Stand up, Come and collect it, [in Yoruba] You'll realize that the teeth a dog uses to play with her puppies are the same teeth she uses to discipline them, Mama, you like to speak in parables? Let me give you one, [in Yoruba] A tree that cannot support us when we rest on it cannot kill us if it falls on us, Korede, stop there! Look at me, [in English] I swear, in front of everybody here today, including the man of God,,, that I, Eniola Salami, will stretch my hands over your dead body, [in Yoruba] It's Makanaki! My name is Makanaki, -Mr, Apata, -Mr, Gobir, Yes, good day, Yes, any new offers on the house yet? Mr, Gobir, these things don't happen overnight, You gave us strict instructions, unless you'd like us to entertain offers below your asking price, [sighs] That's okay, Give it some more time, Mr, Apata, I'll call you back, Hi, It's okay, they are fine, They are with my sister, You need to rest now, ♪ Come and be victorious Lord Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ For your servants ♪ ♪ In the midst of all our enemies ♪ ♪ Father, come and be victorious ♪ ♪ Come and be victorious Lord Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ For your servants ♪ ♪ In the midst of all our enemies ♪ ♪ Father, come and be victorious ♪ ♪ The father is victorious ♪ ♪ The son is victorious ♪ ♪ The Holy Spirit is victorious ♪ You accepted the sacrifice of Olugbon and he became victorious, You accepted the sacrifice of Aresha and he also became successful, You are the one that accepted the sacrifice of Onikoyi, That is how Onikoyi became a powerful person, We reverence you, Great Mother! [Incantations] Akorede, oh! Korede, oh! You have no understanding! You have no understanding, Akorede! It is said that the flood is always determined to wash away the house, but the owner must be ready to prevent it, That is so! A dog that challenges a lion is definitely ready to die, That is so! A butterfly that challenges a thorn head-on will surely have wings and beauty torn to shreds, Open your mouth and say exactly what you want here today, The crown is the identity of a king, Beads are the identity of a chief, I want the crown on Eniola's head, -Give me the crown! -Korede, oh! -Give me the crown! -Korede, oh! -Give me the crown! -I will clear a path with your back, -Give me the crown! -I will drag you through the bushes! -Give me the crown! -I will drag you through the bushes, Give me the crown! -Give me the crown! -I will clear a path with your back, -Give me the crown! -Akorede oh! -Give me the crown! -I will clear a path with your back! [chanting continues] [chanting continues] [chanting continues] [chuckles] [chanting continues] [chanting continues] [scoffs] Ah, sir, With all these? Murder, election manipulation, money laundering? Very, But nothing has been able to stick until now, Look, this woman is as slippery as an eel, Too many government connects, But I know how to get her, Look at the finances, [whistles] Ah, ah, ah, ah,,, All these verified, sir? Look, she's been laundering a lot of money through these businesses, We received a reliable tip that she is the mastermind behind the string of recent political robberies, Her targets can't go to the police and report because these are stolen funds, So she is making out like a bandit, But, sir, these people, Aren't they her political cronies? [in Hausa] Yeah, No honor amongst thieves, I guess, You are right, Look, I want you on this immediately, But, sir, we are still on the Ebele case and-- I know, but this has been pushed up by the powers above, We must get her immediately, [in Hausa] Got it? Yes, sir, Uh, Gobir, -Yes, sir, -I want you to be careful, [in Hausa] She is a terrible person, She can be very dangerous, [Gobir] How dangerous can she be? [Eniola in Yoruba] God, I'm begging you, Don't bring tears to my eyes and pain to my body, [in Yoruba] Kitan, what is it? What have I done to you, this child? Where do I turn to? Where do I turn to? Mum, please, can you sit down? Your constant pacing will drill a hole in this floor, [in Yoruba] Leave me alone! What is wrong with you? Stop it! All I'm saying is calm down or you'll give yourself high blood pressure, -High blood pressure? -He's fine, I've told you that he and Tiger are on the way back, Right, Thank you! [in Yoruba] Thank you, God, I will worship you, Thank you, creator of heaven and earth, Kitan, my dear, what's wrong with you? Look at my life! Kitan, a worried parent will always say to the child, "Child, don't kill me," -"Child, don't kill me," -Mummy, But you'll push me to the point where I say, "Child, don't kill yourself," What's wrong with you? Mummy, you don't know what I went through, Do you ever think of your family before you do the stupid things you do? [Kitan] Mum, please, I'm not in the mood for this girl right now, [in Yoruba] You must have hit your head on the steering wheel in that car crash, You're not in the mood? But you were in the mood to drive piss drunk and total an entire car? -[in Yoruba] Kemi, please, -What if you killed someone? -That’s enough, -Eh? I'm tired of this girl, Stupid bitch, [in Yoruba] Who is a bitch? You must be stupid, You? -My life! -Mummy! In my presence! Do I look like a bag of salt? Right in my presence! Calling your older sister what? You are hitting me because of her? Because of this one? "Because of her?" Who do you think bailed you out and kept your stupidity out of the press? -Do your job! Do your job, -Do my job? -[in Yoruba] That's enough, -You know what? I blame you, -Me? -You baby him and you spoil him and that's why he walks around with this stupid sense of entitlement! That's enough, please, -Entitlement? -Yes! If anybody should be entitled here,,, -Stop! -,,,who should be entitled? You, -Kitan! -At least I am not actively trying to bring shame onto this family! Kemi, That's enough, please, I am tired of letting him get away with everything because "KT is sensitive," Don't say that, He does absolutely nothing but spend money all day! Adds nothing to this family! And after almost ruining his life in England, he comes back here to pick up where he left off! -He'll never change! -That's enough! Mummy, I'm doing my best to be calm, Am I not your son? Should she be talking to me like this? Am I not your son? That's enough! -Wait, -Son? Kitan,,, I am more of a son than you will ever be, -Don't say that! -What do you want to do? -Stop! -What? [in Yoruba] Don't ever say that! It's enough! Don't ever say that! What is the matter with you? Don't ever repeat that in this house! -I blame you, -Blame me for what? -I blame you, -You cannot blame me! You are to blame for everything, You treat him like a two-year-old, [church bells ringing, organ music playing] Alhaja,,, Look, I remember how you helped my son with that unfortunate incident, so I agreed to this meeting out of respect, But honestly, I do not know how I can be of help, That's the problem, Because everyone seems to have forgotten all the good things I have done for them, See, that is the kind of talk that has landed you where you are now, Eniola, What kind of talk, Senator Okon? What kind of talk? Huh? Because I insisted on what was promised to me? [Okon] Yes, See, I don't know how this works where you come from, But, Eniola, you have played politics long enough to know that there are no certainties in this game, And these threats and raids-- I had nothing to do with this, Absolutely nothing, As far as everyone is concerned, you have drawn the battle line, You have made yourself a liability, A dangerous one, Number One is far from happy, I tried calling him, I tried calling him to explain things to him, He is not taking my calls, Nobody is taking my calls, Everyone shut me out completely, despite everything I've done for them, Of course! You have stepped on the tail of the tiger, And I'm afraid what he might do, I need to see him, Can you arrange a meeting? Eniola, I could be in trouble just being seen with you, Not to mention telling you all this, I have to go, Good luck, [sirens wailing] Where are they? Open the gate for them! Come on, open the gate! We have nothing to hide! -Good morning, madam, -Yes? I can't read it, It's an official letter inviting you in, ma, [chuckling] Inviting me? What's going on? You're throwing a party? -For questioning, madam, -Today? Right now, Questioning for what? You will find out when you get to the office, Don't worry, Give me few minutes to change and I'll be with you, -That's fine, -Just stay there please, There, Mum, let's just go, please, You want to change, let's change, [Gobir] Good morning, Mrs, Salami, Pleasure to finally meet you, The pleasure is all mine, My daughter, Kemi Salami, I'll be acting as her legal counsel, Congratulations on your new appointment, Although the man before you happens to be my very good friend, I'm sure you are going to do great in this new appointment of yours, Of course, Mrs, Salami, Thank you, You're welcome, Well, I would not like to insult you by beating around the bush, Do you mind if we go straight to the point? -Oh, please, -Great, Well, first of all I must thank you for coming on such short notice, Well, she didn't have a choice, Your men barricaded our house like she was a criminal, Sorry to hear that, I must speak to my people on better procedure next time, Mr, Gobir, you invited me, and here I am, I have nothing to hide, Well, we are working on a tip from a very reliable source, that you are involved in, uh,,, Yes, Money laundering, drug and weapon smuggling, Surely, you did not bring my mother here on hearsay, And who is this "reliable source" feeding you these tips? Ms, Salami, with all due respect, you know I cannot tell you that, Well, those tips are simply unfounded, My mother is a very hardworking woman with multiple legitimate businesses to her name, Does she look like someone that smuggles drugs or weapons? Thank you for bringing that up That's actually why we invited you all here, You see, our investigation uncovered that you use these businesses to launder money, And we also uncovered that you have multiple high-end properties under the name of,,, Kachi Nwachukwu, who, until recently, was your domestic help, -[chuckles] -Ma'am, I'm not sure how well you pay, but with two high rises in Ikoyi and one in VI,,, And then, you have to explain the source of all that money scattered in your bank accounts, I'm not sure that would be gotten from the sale of lace and bread? I beg your pardon? No, I'm saying she doesn't pay enough tax for that to be so, Wait, you have her account information? Surely that's gross infringement of privacy, at least, Ms, Salami, I assure you we have legal jurisdiction, You are allowed to be in this meeting simply out of courtesy, Your mother here does not need a lawyer, neither does she need a mouthpiece, It's just a simple questioning, I mean, it's just a mere conversation, So, I'll suggest that you allow her to speak for herself, That's all right, As she said, I have loads of businesses, A few fabric shops, bakeries where I make my sweet, beautiful Agege bread two water bottling companies, other-- And if you gave us time, we would have brought the necessary documents needed to answer your questions in this regard, As for the properties owned by Kachi, she's worked with my mother since I was, what-- six years old? -But we haven't seen her in,,, two years? -Yeah, two years, Two years, So unless you can tie us to these buildings, I find this course of questioning disrespectful and completely out of order, [static] [in Pidgin] Guy, why did you get a car with a broken radio? Turn down the volume, Turn it down, Call Tiger now, -His phone is switched off, -Call him again, Call him again, fast, -Mr, Gobir? -Yes, You didn't have to walk me out, you know, It's my pleasure, -Please, -Oh, thank you, Needless to say, you must let us know before any international travel, [laughs] Like I said earlier, I have nothing to hide, so I'm not running, Thank you once again and have a lovely evening, [Tiger] Hello? -Hmm, -Mom, are you okay? King, Musa and Tango have got the package cornered, Should they take it out? Stop, [sighs] The ground is very, very hot, It's because of Gobir's interference, -Ade, Tiger, -Yes, ma, Keep eyes on him for now, Boys, stand down, Yes, boss, Yeah, Okay, -Kemi, -Mum, Get a gift to Mr, Gobir to apologize for his inconvenience, How much of an inconvenience are we talking? [chuckles] A very big inconvenience, Yeah, it's me, I need you to handle something for me immediately, [sighs] [yawns] [in Hausa] Lord have mercy! [phone ringing] Hello? [distorted voice] I see you got our gift, Who is this? It's a hand of friendship from Alhaja Salami, What if I refuse the gift? Trust me, sir, You would rather be friends with the Alhaja than her enemy, Is that a threat? Ah, Mr, Gobir, When did $500,000 in cash become a threat? I'm going to die, aren't I? Don't say that! [in Hausa] Don't talk like this, Hauwa, That will never happen, God forbid, Come, God forbid, Come, Come, [woman crying] [news jingle] [news anchor] Good evening, I am Sade Bello, -[sirens blaring] -KAVTV can now confirm that political ally and socialite Alhaja Eniola Salami has been arrested this evening by state officials on suspicion of murder, money laundering, diversion of state funds, bribing a state agent, It has been confirmed that she has been taken into custody to an undisclosed location, I demand to be let in to see my mother, Madam, you cannot demand anything here, I'm her lawyer, Madam, you cannot see her now, She is going through booking and-- What? So, you intend to keep her here overnight? -Madam, -[Gobir] Ms, Salami, -Sir! -You see, there is no need to get overexcited, You will see your mum as soon as she is booked and processed, So you are keeping her here overnight? Yes, hopefully, And every other night until trial, On what charges? Okay, There you go, [scoffs] You can't prove any of this, [whispers] Can I have this, please? Shit, [grunts] Ah, ah, [in Yoruba] Eni, you will hurt me, Good girl, Why would I be dealing with a bloody servant when he has a king? Ah, [laughs] -I salute you, boss, -Yes, yes? -We have a small big problem, -What are you saying? Alhaji, I'll be on my way, Say what you have to say and stop bothering me, Can't you see I'm-- Alaaru was arrested just before he boarded the plane, How? But we have people in there, Someone snitched on him, Have you reached out to our people in there to see if there is anything they can do? It's too late, He has been detained, -Has he mentioned my name? -Not yet, sir, Hurry up! Reach out to our people on the inside so they can handle the situation, -Do you understand me? -Yes, sir, You understand? Go and do something about it!

With which guy? That guy that walks around running his mouth, I was just staring at him, wondering if he was talking to me, Lord have mercy, Eni-Baby, You intoxicate me like alcohol all the time, I wish I met you when I was young, -You would have recognized! -Alhaji, you still have it now, That's not true, There's a huge difference, You would have enjoyed me the way the white man enjoys cigars, That would have been too much, My good lover, My sweet lover, My darling lover, Eni, Eni, You make me happy all the time, But I've asked you to marry me and you have refused, What is wrong? Marry me, Eni, listen, Why do you keep punishing me like this all the time? I am asking you to marry me, What is wrong with you? Eni, Don't you already have a wife? Yes or no? So? What does that have to do with anything? Look, I can marry up to four wives, Oh, so you want to marry four wives? -No, -That's what you're saying, Don't misunderstand me, young lady, Look, I want you, It's you I want, Eni, Eni, Alhaji, You know I would do anything for you in this life, Any bloody thing, I would do it, But me?

Yeah, Code, Tiger, please give me 15 minutes, I'll be right down, Where have you been? Why haven't you been picking up my calls? I've been trying to reach you all day, Kitan, not now please, I'm exhausted, I've been at the holding cell all day trying to make bail, [Kitan] When is she coming out? I'm doing everything I can, but they're intent on keeping her, I mean they don't even want to discuss bail and all our political contacts are distancing,,, Hello, You must be so tired, Is there anything I can do to help? [Kitan] This is my girlfriend, Amaka, Amaka, Kemi, My,,, The one I told you about, Oh, hi! Amaka is a lawyer as well, So, I have been trying to get her up to speed on everything that's going on, So, what I want you guys to do is sit down and strategize, so we can try to come up with a solution to this whole thing, All right? [indistinct] [scoffs] [Kemi] So what you are telling me is that,,, Wait, Kitan, So, you discussed private family business with an outsider, huh? Kitan,,, if you think for a second that I'm going to sit down and talk strategy with one of your whores-- Hey, there's no need for all that, You're even more clueless than I've given you credit for, [Amaka] My darling,,, You know what, I think I should go, No, This is my mother's house, If anyone is going to leave, she is welcome to, [sighs] What's all this attitude? Is it not you I'm talking to? -Kemi, -Kitan, babe, Babe, calm down, -This is the rubbish I have to deal, -[Amaka] I know, -[in Yoruba] Good afternoon, -Welcome, -Is this Kemi? -Yes, it's her, She's all grown up, Kem-Kem, Bunmi,,, Bunmi, -Bunmi, -[in Yoruba] Oh, Eni-Baby, You came, Of course, I dashed here as soon as I heard, It's been a long time, [Bunmi] You look so good, [coughs] I'm so glad you got out of that place early, I can see that life has been kinder to you, -Look at my Eni-Baby, -How are you? How are you doing? Sometimes bad, sometimes worse, Today is bad, So I thank God, Look, See, I am going to take you to a hospital that is very, very good, [in Yoruba] A hospital where they know what they're doing, Do you understand? Don't worry, I just need one favor from you, Name anything, No, No, Look, you're going to get better and take care of your child by yourself, [in Yoruba] You hear me? By the grace of God, you will get better and you will take care of her by yourself, That's exactly what will happen, No, I will not, It's already too late, There is no cure for this thing, Don't talk like that, [in Yoruba] What do these people know? They don't know anything, What do they know? All they are looking for is money, Let me tell you something, Chief knows every doctor, There is no doctor,,, [in Yoruba] Look, we will fly them in, We will fly them in, Do you understand? I just want you to take care of Kemi for me, There is no other person on this earth I can trust more, I don't want her to grow up in my environment, That dirty world we grew up in, Please help me give her a better life, A life I can never give her, but you now can, I promise, I promise, Tiger, I need you to do something very important for me, -[knocking at door] -Come in, [woman] Just wanted to make sure you were ready, sir, Yes, I am, Do you have all the files with you? They are right here with me, sir, -Oh, good, So let's go then, -All right, sir, [phone vibrates] -I'll meet you downstairs, -All right, sir, Look, honey, I really don't have the time to talk now, I'm on the way to the court, [man] That's exactly why we must talk now, Who is this and what are doing with my wife's phone? -[crying] -You, talk to your husband, Honey, please help us, -Do whatever they tell you, -[men shouting] Please, That's my entire family, Please, Don't hurt any one of them, I don't want to, But if you don't want me to send you their body parts one after the other, you must do something for me, [bailiff] May we all rise for The Honorable Justice Nwachukwu, Please be seated, I'll go right to it, After deliberating on the evidence presented to this court, I feel the NCCC has failed to establish a direct link between Alhaja Salami and the $500,000 bribe, All other evidence is circumstantial at best, Not forgetting that Alhaja Salami is a respected member of society with strong ties with the community, With all these in mind, I have no other choice than to grant Alhaja Salami bail without conditions, [crowd clamoring] -[gavel banging] -Silence in court! -[gavel banging] -Silence in court! [clamoring continues] [reporters clamoring] Calm down, Calm down, Calm down, Calm down, Loosely borrowing from the words of the very well-respected Justice Nwachukwu, my mother is an upstanding member of this community, [clamoring continues] And it is completely outrageous how she is being treated, We caution the NCCC to cease this witch-hunt of Alhaja Salami, Or we will have no other recourse than to seek redress in the court of law, Hold on, As you can tell, my mother is very tired, So no more questions, but you can expect a formal statement from us soon, Thank you, [clamoring] [gun cocks] [gunshot, screaming] [no audible dialogue] Oh,,, [in Yoruba] How is everything now? Oh, I don't want to hear any business talk from you, No business talk, Everything you're supposed to be doing, I'm handling it, So don't worry about it, Our business is doing very fine, That shouldn't be your burden to bear, You shouldn't be doing any work in this your condition, I am not having any condition, I am having your son, You say I am having "condition," Besides, it's only till you get well, I don't know if that will ever happen, [in Yoruba] God forbid! By the grace of God, you are already well, Look, in the name of Jesus,,, As long as the Almighty Father that I serve is alive, you are already well, Look, you are already well, but you just don't know it yet, I'll be mad at you, Don't ever say that, Eni, I don't know how much time I still have, And I want to see my family, [in Yoruba] For God's sake, please, Please, let me see them, Please, [in Yoruba] For God's sake, Alhaji, something has happened, There was a very bad accident, And in that car crash, not a single soul survived, Eh? I didn't know how to tell you, That was why I kept quiet about it, Because, how do I even say that type of a thing? Eni! Ah, Eni, Now that we have joined you both in holy matrimony according to Islamic rites, and as the holy prophet Muhammad has instructed, we will round this off with the Fatiha prayer, [praying in Arabic] [praying continues] -[women weeping] -[priest] Father Lord, you wept at the death of Lazarus, Please console those who now grieve the loss of a loved one, Comfort them in the remembrance of your promises, Give those who mourn peace in the midst of tears and suffering, You are the resurrection and the life, Let those that despair find hope and consolation in Your presence and Your love, Oh, Heavenly Father, we pray, Amen, [banging on door] [woman] I've been trying to-- Kitan, Kitan, [Kitan sobbing] [in Pidgin] Get this guy out of my sight! I should have done this myself! So Maka, how will you handle this Nwachukwu family situation? -Cancel them, -Yes, boss, [sighs] She died in my hands, Amaka, my hands, Kitan, you are drunk, And high, How do you intend to take care of your mum like this? It will all be okay, I promise, Look, your mother needs you, but you cannot go to her in this condition, Kitan, you have to be strong, This is the time for you to take charge and show your mother you can lead the family, [sniffling] Have you eaten? You need to sober up, Let me make you some coffee, [phone chiming] [beeping] Passcode, What are you doing? -Who's this, Amaka? -Why are you going through my phone? I don't understand, What does this mean? You shouldn't have gone through my phone, [Kitan] I thought you said you loved me, Baby, calm down let me explain, -You said you loved me, -I do, You don't understand, It's not what you think, It was a mistake, She was my sister! But, Kitan, you hated her, [screams] [gasping, choking] [bones cracking] [Eniola screams] In an unbelievable turn in this ongoing saga, KAVTV has just learned that Alhaja Salami has lost her only son to what seems to be a murder-suicide, [screams] This news just comes one day after her daughter was gunned down outside Justice Nwachukwu's court by unknown assassins seemingly gunning for Alhaja herself, Bad news must come in threes as this comes on the heels of NCCC freezing assets of the business mogul, Will this be the end of the Salami empire as we have come to know it? [crying] KAVTV has also learned that the bodies of the wife and children of Justice Nwachukwu were discovered this morning on the side of Epe road off Badagry Axis, We are told that there are currently no suspects, KAVTV has reached out to the police for a statement but they have declined to comment at this time, as investigations are still ongoing, [wailing] [screaming] [in Yoruba] Leave me alone! [shouting, wailing continues] [laughing] So that is it, my people, We are going to re-strategize, We are going to,,, What sort of madness is this? [in Yoruba] So because of the cat's absence, -rats have taken possession of the house, -What? My husband's body is not even cold in the grave but you've taken possession of his seat, isn't it? Eniola, Look, I know that Alhaji stupidly accommodated your excesses, But I can assure you that we won't tolerate your stepping over your boundaries, [in Yoruba] Never, Okay, Alhaji Taiwo, you are sitting in my seat, That is my seat, [in Yoruba] Get up! -Abomination! -Shut your dirty mouth, Who is this? Eniola, Eniola, Your boldness is more than that of a dog who has walked into a lion's den, You! Why should I be afraid of a lion that is so powerless? You stupid woman! What are-- [choking] The taproot that stands in the way of an elephant will definitely be crushed, [bones cracking] Does anybody else have anything they want to say? -Not at all, -No, please feel free, Speak your mind, [in Yoruba] No, After what just happened? It is settled, My name is Eniola Salami, and I accept to be your leader, Let us begin, [sirens approaching] [banging on gate] [woman] Look at you, Hmph, [in Yoruba] Take a look at your life, The mighty Eniola Salami, Look what you have turned us into, Look what you have turned us into! You are weak, Weak! In my time, could this have happened? Could this have happened? It's making my skin crawl, It's making my skin crawl! You have ruined everything! You have destroyed the house that I built! They will never see you for more than what you really are: a bloody gangster, ♪ A mother is a priceless jewel ♪ ♪ A mother is a priceless jewel ♪ -Useless mother, -Kemi, Why did you do this to me? [crying] You should have protected me, [in Yoruba] My daughter, I tried! You should have shielded me, You should have kept me away from this life, -[in Yoruba] You killed me! -No! Kemi! Oh! My child, My child, please, Mummy, I want to come home, [in Yoruba] Come home, please, Mummy, I want to come home, Come home, please, I want to come home, Come home, -I miss you, -I want to come home, [angry hiss] [Bunmi in Yoruba] Don't call her Mother, She's not your mom, A beast like her shouldn't be called so, -Bunmi, -These ones eat their young, Bunmi, don't say that, Eniola, I trusted you with my only child, No! It's not like that! And this is what you do to her? I love Kemi, Argh! I love Kemi like my own, I can never hurt you! [man in Yoruba] Shut your dirty mouth! Nuisance, You murdered my family in cold blood, [Eniola] No, no! You put us through so much agony, No! No! No! No! No! It wasn't like that, It was an accident, -[man] Accident? -Yes, -Accident that you orchestrated yourself, -[baby crying] For what? Because you wanted my inheritance, You wanted my wealth all to yourself, Isn't it? No, it wasn't that, Then what was it? Look at my child, My infant child [Eniola screaming] [Gobir] Mrs, Salami, Mrs, Salami, can I get you some water? Mrs, Salami? Water? I know it's a difficult day for you, and I apologize for what we-- Do you believe in hell? What? Do you believe there is a hell where people pay for their sins? I,,, Yes, I believe that there is Jahannam, where all of those found wanting by Allah end up, Have I been found wanting, Mr, Gobir? Only Allah can judge that, Allah, [scoffs] I used to think I was a god, Mr, Gobir, Is that blasphemy, Mr, Gobir? Can we just talk about your case now, Mrs, Salami? God, All I love in this world,,, is dead, [sobbing] And yet,,, yet,,, I am still here, [in Yoruba] They say a leaf does not fall far from a tree without God's consent, This has become my hell for impersonating God, Mr, Gobir, [no audible dialogue] But she hasn't said anything worthy of mention here, Yes, sir, She's obviously extremely traumatized, Don't tell me you're beginning to feel sorry for her, [snickers] Of course not, sir, Anyway, cease all interrogations and further investigations, She is being transferred to another holding facility, To face prosecution for the murder of Justice Nwachukwu's family, But, sir, we should be allowed to finish questioning her as regards the money laundering and bribery charges, I mean, we've been building our cases for long, And we have jurisdiction, sir, Look, this is above me, The orders came from above, [in Hausa] Who cares about a simple bribery case? We have her on Nwachukwu's murder case, Who cares about a simple bribery case? Sir, I do! It's more than a simple bribery case to me, [in Hausa] It was a threat to my family and me, When did $500,000 become a threat, Mr, Gobir? Is that a threat? [distorted voice] Ah, Mr, Gobir, when did $500,000 in cash become a threat? Just cease all investigations, Is there anything else? No, sir, [phone rings] Sule, I need you to do me a favor, Can I trust you'll keep this between us? Good, Now, it's very urgent, I would like you to,,, You have five minutes, sir, don't exceed it, I could get into trouble, [whispers] Mrs, Salami? Mrs, Salami? I need to speak with you, It's very urgent, Did you kidnap and kill the family of Justice Nwachukwu? [Eniola grunting] [Gobir] I need you to be very, very honest with me, Did you send me that bribe? What does the truth matter? Mrs, Salami, if it didn't, I wouldn't be here, Do not test God, No, no, don't test God, He's finally making me pay for my sins, I accept it, Mr, Gobir, Mrs, Salami, is this too your sin? Did you order the kidnap and murder of Justice Nwachukwu's family? His wife and young children-- No! I have many things on my conscience, I refuse to let them add that to it, But why would Justice Nwachukwu say it was you? Gobir,,, there are many people in power who want me out of the way, And are willing to do anything to make sure it happens, I have done many things,,, unspeakable things in life, I did not touch that man's family, I did not, Never, I didn't, I didn't, I did not, I did not, I did not, Yes, Dr, Shobanjo? Mr, Gobir, we've had an emergency complication with your wife's health, We need to take her into surgery straightaway, All right, I will be with you immediately, -Okay, -This is the file you asked for, Thank you, Okay, where are you? We need you to sign off on it immediately, Okay, okay, please, I'll be there soon, I'll be there soon, [phone ringing] Hello, Detective Samuel? Fantastic, Fantastic, Good, Do you know Silas Specialist Hospital? Okay, meet me there immediately, As soon as you can, please, Yes, thank you, No, no, no, We won't know anything for about three to four hours, Mr, Gobir, I need you to understand that this will not solve the problem, It only buys your wife a little time, She will need that transplant surgery, even more than ever, Yes, It's a dire situation, sir, I understand, Doctor, I'm working on it, Please, tell Dr, Shobanjo I have to take care of something very urgent, I'll be back before my wife leaves the theater, Yes? When is our friend scheduled to move? Ah, Oh, I will send an assoc-- I will send a friend of mine to visit her before then, [in Yoruba] Give him access and grant him smooth passage, Of course, sir, Okay, It is done, [in Yoruba] Makanaki, I hope this friendship we've started today will last a long time, Isn't that so? I will hold you to your promise, [knocking at door] What sort of insubordination is this, Gobir? You come into my house without an appointment and you are being rude? In the last nine months, you have had in excess of 50 million naira, deposited in your account, by Deltec Consortium and Holdings, You've been spying on me? Do you know who owns Deltec Consortium? Chief Durosimi, But you and I know he's just a front man for the business,,, Inspector Gobir! ,,,and Aare Akinwande, Ah, This does not mean a thing, He and I have been involved in some business ventures, Oh, really? But you did not see the last page, See here, This contains the details of all the calls you made on the 13th of August 2017, What? You were careful to block your number, making it untraceable for me on the other end, But you cannot erase the record of the numbers you called, You see this? You see this, sir? You called this number at exactly 23:30 hours, That is my number, And that is the exact time I got the call bribing me with $500,000 I found in my car, Inspector Gobir, I was told you were downstairs, How's your wife? Much better, ma'am, She's much better, Aw, you must have missed her home made food, I made some fine Egusi soup tonight, Let me get you some, No, no, no, no, please, I don't want you to go through the trouble, I ate before I came here, Oh, It's no trouble, Okay, at least something to drink, A cold beer? Woman! He says he doesn't want anything! So, what do you intend to do now? The right thing, Gobir, that would be a mistake, A mistake? For me or for you? Oh, spare me the sanctimonious bullshit, I have been on the force for over 40 years, What do I have out of it? A salary that barely feeds my family or gotten my kids through school? Gobir, I got this house just six months ago, And look at you, you can't afford to treat your dying wife, You will leave my wife out of this! [in Hausa] Don't bring her into this, Look, all I'm saying is I am just a small fish in the big river of things, It is not just me, Everyone is on the take, This is how the economy keeps moving, You make it look as if I'm doing something strange when you're the odd one out, So that's why you sold your soul to the devil? I didn't sell my soul, I just look the other way when it is necessary, You bribed me, pretending it was from her, All we needed was a stronger case to have a hold on her, We needed her out immediately and you were taking your time, So what if I had kept the money, and I didn't report it? Ah, come on, Gobir, It is you, You are straighter than a ruler, [Gobir] And what about the assassination outside the court? That has nothing to do with me, absolutely, We just needed a stronger case to arrest her, [scoffs] Look, they are going after her tonight, What? They can't afford to keep her alive, She is too much of a threat, They are going after her before she is transferred tomorrow, How did you know this? I don't know much, All I'm supposed to do is to secure access to her, and look the other way, The guards have been paid off, It's amazing how you are able to wake up every day and look at yourself in the mirror, Look, she is not a saint, She is a murderer, the scum of the earth, People like that deserve whatever comes to them, and even more, No matter how you try to reason this out in your head, it does not change the fact that the blood of that woman and her family is on your hands, And I will ensure you are punished to the fullest extent of the law, Please, this is my life, This is my family, Your family and the rest of the world deserve to see you for who you truly are, An utter disgrace! Sir, Yes, Samuel, I need you to do something very urgent for me, -Yeah? I'd like you to,,, -[call waiting beeping] Stay on the line, Samuel, Don't hang up, -Dr, Shobanjo? -[static] Mr, Gobir, Mr, Gobir, can you,,, [Gobir] Yes, how did it go? -[static] -Mr, Gobir, can you hear me? -Mr, Gobir, your wife is,,, -Is she out already? -Can you hear me?

Cigarette! [in Yoruba] Boss, you're holding a cigarette! [in Yoruba] Who is that? Who is there? Akorede, I knew you would come, I was wondering when, [in Yoruba] Oh! So you've been expecting me? The Bible says where there is carcass, vultures gather, So you know it all ends tonight? You will die tonight, [laughing] -Akorede! -Hmm? You can only kill the body, You cannot kill the spirit, Because my spirit is already gone, It left with my children, Mama, Then my work is done, I'm the one who killed them, What do you want? What do you want? Korede, you want to kill me? Where is the knife? Give me your knife, [in Yoruba] Give me the gun, I'll do it, I'll kill myself! I'll make it quick! I'll save you the trouble! And what would be my pleasure in that? There is no satisfaction in that, I want to see you weeping, wailing, and begging in agony, -I even want to see that in my dreams, -Your mother, Your grandmother, Your mother must have cursed God when she was giving birth to you, [laughing] Korede! I'll wait for you in hell! Korede! Korede! [men chattering] [in Yoruba] Let's go, [glass shatters] [Gobir speaking foreign language] [continues in foreign language] Who did this? Who did this?

Let me be, Mrs, Salami, please we don't have time, We need to leave now, please, Let us go, This is not how you want to die, How do you know? If I don't die here, they will kill me out there, Those people will never let me walk away alive, Mrs, Salami, please, [coughing] [siren wailing] We need to take her to the hospital for further treatment, We cannot tell how much smoke she has inhaled, She cannot go alone with you in this vehicle, She is a high risk prisoner, It's okay, Detective Samuel, She will ride with me instead, I mean, my wife is in the same hospital, Okay, sir, I will join you, No, I need someone here I can trust, Just make sure all these things are handled properly, And the guys on duty, get them into custody, When backup arrives, send a few men to the hospital to relieve me, -Yes, sir, -Please let's go, Mrs, Salami, -Sorry, Easy, easy,,, -Thank you, -Hello, Dr, Shobanjo? -Mr, Gobir, I've been trying to reach you, -I'm sorry, I'm on my way immediately, -Mr, Gobir, -Is she awake? How is she doing? -Mr, Gobir? Mr, Gobir? -Dr, Sho-- -I'm sorry, she's gone, We lost her during surgery, Mr, Gobir,,, Mr, Gobir, are you there? Mr, Gobir? [sobbing] [shouting, wailing] If you walk to the end of the road, at the junction,,, there's a 24-hour call center, Do you have anyone you trust that can come and get you? Mr, Gobir, I don't understand, There, [sniffles] For the call, There's enough there in case you need to get a taxi, I don't,,, I still don't understand, You're right, Mrs, Salami, They're not gonna let you live, There's too much death, Mr, Gobir,,, won't you get into trouble for doing this?
