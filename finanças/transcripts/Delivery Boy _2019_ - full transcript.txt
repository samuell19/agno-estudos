Hey there. Eric, right? Nice to see you again? You wanna hear something crazy? Pork and leek are my favourite too! Maybe we have something more in common than just dumping fillings? Is this yours? I just thought it would be easier if I contacted them directly. Right… you don't pay me for thinking. Thank you. I'll check with you next time. It won't happen again. Touch it! I'm okay... C'mon! Touch it! So soft, isn't it? And the style is so Chanel. Ugh... I hate people. Oh my God, it's Eric! Eric who?! The pork and leek guy. He's so dreamy... I would kill for that suede jacket. Probably costs more than what I make in a year... You should go talk to him! You think so? Yes! The sooner you talk to him, the sooner you'll realize he's just another asshole. Just like the one before. And the one before that! Hey gossip girls, back to work! Here. You dropped these. Oh thanks. Thanks so much. Sure, no problem. You look really familiar. Have we met? I don't know… Have you ordered food from 'Taste House'? Right... of course. You're basically the reason I don't quit my job and move home to Whales. Am I? Yes. Your dumplings. Oh... No, really. They're the highlight of my day. And you're the highlight of mine... Say that again? I was just saying, I'll make sure to tell the cook. Please do. Do you need help with those? No, it's okay. I got these. Yes sir, I did send the email last night, like we discussed. I did bcc you, I don't know what happened. I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to imply that. Look, I”ll send it over one more time, right now. It will take two minutes. Right. Yes. I am aware it's Saturday, and... OK sir, understood. Asshole. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it. Sure. Hey. If it makes you feel any better, I hate my job too. You do? Yeah. I'm always sweaty, I have to work on weekends, and so many people live in walk ups! I hate people… Let's make a deal. Come Monday, let's just… quit! OK, I'm listening. We can form a band. I can play the guitar, and you can… sing? Couple of notes. So what's our style? I don't know. We can just go to H&M. No, I mean, what kind of music? Do you like... disco? Who doesn't? So disco it is! We just need to think of a band name now? My name is Eric. What's yours? ChunHo. ChunHo. Okay What about… Chuneric? No. It sounds like generic. And who would like to listen to generic? Well, I guess we can keep thinking about it… Good idea. Any chance you didn't hear that? That's sexy… I guess it's past my lunch time. Wait. Isn't that somebody else's order? They'll live. I'm meeting Lsasagna and Bette at that karaoke place in Jordan. You should come with us. No, thanks. I hate that place. They only have Hong Kong songs. Besides... I'm meeting Eric again. What!? Like on a date?! Yeah, sort of... Sort of? Did you exchange phone numbers? Not yet. You should know that when expats are interested they'll give you their phone numbers. I can read a room, OK? He was definitely interested! Uh-huh. I'll bring the glue tomorrow. Glue?! Yeah, to put together your broken heart. Oh... hi. Hey. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I forgot my jacket earlier. Right. It's downstairs. Eric! You got a light? C'mon man, I need to smoke something. I don't have one. Here. This man has his act together. You're the new intern, right? Oh... No… Mr. Taylor, this is my delivery boy. Delivery boy? Oh, you mean your dealer. What you got? No no, he works for 'Food Panda. Oh! I had a thought about that. Booze Panda. Think about it, you get booze delivered, like pizza, it'd be great! We should talk about this. ' We can make some serious money. Well, I guess now you have to stay. Are you? Yeah, definitely. We still have to talk bout band names. Eric! Don't go anywhere. Oh I just finished it. But there's more downstairs. Eric, this is unacceptable. I know. I need my vodka! Yes sir. Send the delivery boy. That's why he's here for, right? Well… Well what? Is he your friend or something now? Of course not. Go on then. Ah there he is. Hey boy, come here. Somebody here doesn't now how to plan a party. C'mon, chop chop. Go on, give him some money. Two bottles? Yeah two bottles of vodka. And two packs of Marlboros. Go on and take it. Public bathrooms are so gross! You're right. They're all the same. Look Chun-Chun, You deserve so much better! Do you want to have dinner tonight? On me! I have all that vodka money anyway... When do I ever say no to free food?! Jasper, you're going to Prince Building. Chunho, you're going to the pork and leek guy. Shit... Hi... Do you work with Chunho? Wait, hold on! Get off me! Asshole! You think you're so much better than everyone else. Well, you're not! Enjoy the food. I added a little something to it. Look I know I screwed up, OK? And I feel terrible, I really do. Being surrounded by scumbags just made me behave like one. Or I just have to accept that I'm no different. The thing is, I haven't stopped thinking about Chunho all day. I want to… I need to talk to him. Can you help me find him? Let's go! I'm so hungry. Hey. Look, I know that you probably don't want to deal with me right now. I certainly wouldn't if I were you. But hear me out, OK? Ever since I got here, I've been going through the slow process of becoming this obnoxious, entitled cliche of a person. And you know something? I've been fine with that. Until yesterday. Being surround by scumbags all day you forget that there are kind, generous... very attractive souls out there. Even if they do knock on your door every night. I'm not that jerk, you know? At least not all the time. I'd really like to show the other side of me. You know how the combination of pork and leek makes the perfect dumplings? That's not us. Guys like you, and guys like me, we're just a bad recipe. I had an idea. For our band name. The Delivery Boys. Cause we deliver. Look, let me make it up to you. Have dinner with me? I can't. I have dinner plans. Right. I understand. Wait! How about during the week? I'd love that. Just... no takeouts, OK? Deal. I should go... Text me? Can I ask you something? How did yu get Jasper to give you my address? Well... It took some convincing...
