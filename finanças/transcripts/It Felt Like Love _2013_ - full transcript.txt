You know it looks more suspicious if you stand outside, right? Shh. Come on. Just touch it. No. It's not gonna bite. Come here. No. Stop. call me when you get home. All right. Like the second you walk through the door. Okay. Please exit through the rear door. He's too cute. Yeah. He, uh, went down on me for the first time last week. He did? Yeah. It was good, but he definitely needs practice. Yeah. I hate it when they need practice. If you're not gonna feed the dog, neither am I. We don't even have dog food. You know where the money is. You go to the store, you buy things for yourself. What's in there, coffee? Anything good? Should we euthanize her? Let's do it. For fun. Much easier than fighting. Why are you still wearing your bathing suit? It's summer. It's hot. Let's play a game. I thought you wanted to watch TV. I did, but now I'm bored. Dare. Like truth or dare? Like what? It could be anything. Come on. Use your imagination. It's just not the kind of game you play with two people. It's just more fun with a group, you know? How 'bout checkers? Come on. Come on. Please. Please. Please. Come on. Come on. I love how dark I get during the summer. Sometimes I get so dark people actually think I'm black. Shut up. It's true. Do you have any tampons? No. Nothing? I'm kind of irregular, so I don't need them that much. That's gonna be a big problem once you start having sex. Hey, Chiara! Oh, hey, Sammy. How's your summer been? - It's going good. You? - Fine. Do you still work at hall of fame? Yeah. You should stop by sometime and say hi. Okay. All right. See ya. No. He's just some guy I know from my neighborhood. You sure you never dated him? - No. He's a douche. He'd fuck anything. Who was that? Just some girl I was hanging out with. Who? Just some girl. What's her name? Jessica. Is she in your grade? She's in sixth, going into seventh. We made out. You did? Yeah. It was all her idea. I met a guy. Cool. Where? At the beach. He went down on me. All right. It was good, but he needs practice. So, what are you doing later? Probably going out. All right. So, I'll just come over after dinner. Wanna help? No. What else do you have to do today? Stuff. Like? Stuff. You used to like to help. Please exit through the rear door. You can't get her or whatever. I was, like, "all right. Watch me." I walk over to introduce myself. Bro, this girl is 35 years old. Thirty-five? Thirty-five. How'd that go? I didn't think I was gonna get it. Talked to her about five minutes. Next thing you know, boom, got her number, and that was it. Maybe that's cause there was no more alcohol left. I took a walk to mobil. And, like, this guy is standing at the window, and he's taking mad long. And I'm, like, "hurry the fuck up. I'm trying to get my beer." He's like, "oh, shut up." Did you hit him? Yeah. This hand is killing me. Yeah? Yeah. I knocked him out. Hi. Hey. How's it going? Good. Cool, uh, I was just in the neighborhood. Shopping. Where do you live? Gravesend. And you were shopping around here? Yeah. Mmm. How do I know you again? The beach. That's right. You look different. Yeah. So, do you go to Murrow with Chiara? - Yeah. That's a nerdy school, right? Like, it is and it isn't. Mm-hmm. What school do you go to? Kingsborough. High school or college? College. Um, I should get back to work. Yeah. Uh, do you have matches? You know that's bad for you, right? Yeah. Lila, you're late again. Class started 15 minutes ago. Hurry up and get in there. I like your hair as it is. It gets so light in the summer. It's pretty. I hate it. So, what's your favorite way to masturbate? What? What's your favorite way to masturbate? What? Just tell me. All right. So, show me. No. Just show me. No. Come on. Nope. No. Have you ever made out with Lila? I've made out with all my girlfriends but Lila. I think you should make out with Lila. Lila? No. Thanks. Why not? 'Cause you could have herpes or something. Thanks. I'd rather have herpes than rabies. Oh. You've reached the offices of the president of the United States. Nah. I'm playing. This is Sammy. If I call you back, I call you. If I don't, then, oh well. It feels so nice. Nice? Really nice. I really wanna be with you. Keep going. Like, I wanna be with you, be with you. I don't know. Why? 'Cause you've been with other guys. Three. Three's a lot when you think about it. You know, one, two, three. Is it? Don't stop. Why does it bother you? It doesn't. Just forget it. Yo. Hey, Sammy? Yeah. It's Lila, Chiara's friend. You forgot your shit here. Yeah, I- I kind of need them back. I'm at work. You can swing by and grab them. Um, can I maybe meet you after work tomorrow? Look what Patrick got me. Shh. Stick your finger in there. They'll suck on it. No. They don't have teeth. You do it and tell me what it feels like. You're scared of everything. I'm not, but think what you want. Get on. Do you get dizzy easy? No. Uh-huh. Boo! Sorry. I was just taking a piss. Come on. This way. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Chiara's always got boyfriends. Well, that's different. Why? 'Cause she's needy. Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you want something from me? What would I want anyways? Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. What's Chiara doing tonight? Out with her new boyfriend. Who's her new boyfriend? This guy, Patrick. It's kind of serious. He gave her a promise ring. It won't last. It might. It won't. You're so pessimistic. I'm not pessimistic, but, trust me, it won't last. They're in love, so it might. They're not in love. Yes. They are. Oh. No. No. That's right. Discipline the animal. Hear? Try spanking him. Like this. Stop. Yo, does your dog like to get high? I don't know. What's the dog's name? Coffee. What kind of name is that? You named your dog after a hot fucking beverage? Ignore them. They're just being dicks. She's so hot. So hot. Gross. Why is she rubbing herself like that? 'Cause it gets her off. Looks painful. Her titties are kind of perky. She's got peach titties. She's got a nice ass. I remember one time I made a porn. My ex-girl found the video. She didn't like it so much. Punched me in my face. I still got to keep the porno, though. I've thought about doing that. Doing what? Like, as a career option. Really? Yeah, totally. Like, the hours are really good and so is the pay. And I like sex, a lot. Like, a lot, a lot. She's not very good. I've seen better. What's your name again? Lila. Lila, why don't you come and put your ass right here? So I can smack your ass with this paddle... Till it turns sore. Turn that white ass red. I should go. I have to get up early. It's the weekend. Yeah, but, my mom's in the hospital. Get me a 40. - Where do you live? 25th ave. Between what and what? What and what? Well, we can't drive up and down your block all night. Hmm. under, over, drop. Drop. Out and... Out, to the side. Left. Okay. Under, over, drop, around, drop, up. Out, in, left, right, left. One, two, drop, three and get lower. Out, in, one, two, three. And then you jump into line, right. Can you look at something? No. Just look. I'm sure you're fine. Just look. What am I looking for exactly? Does it look red or irritated? I- I don't know. I would do this for you. I really don't know. It looks like you've been scratching it. I have. That's why you're checking if there's anything there. I'm sure you'll be fine. What do you think about, you know, keeping things open? Why? 'Cause you've had all these other experiences. I'm older. A little, anyway. Look, I know I want to be with you. But I can't commit until we're even. Even? You know what I mean. No. Say it. Don't make me say it. You need some help? You look like you're coming apart. Okay. Olivia, Levia, Rita and Aiden, please come help light candles 16 through 10. You never get mad... Except when I miss my curfew. You are a pair of angels that supports me in everything I pursue. You threw me this party in such a spectacular venue, and you even let me pick the tasty dessert menu. To say we're always happy would be untrue, but we stick together and don't need family therapy or glue. Mom and dad, come help me light candles number three and two. You are so close to my heart, and I'm totally smitten. When I see you, my heart pounds and my eyes brighten. So handsome and gentle, in your arms, my knees weaken. I hope this moment lasts and never comes undone. Zach, please help me light the most special on my cake, candle number one. Is everything okay? Can I cut in? Um, I didn't get a chance to talk to you. My hands are kind of full. When did you and Patrick break up? I don't really want to talk about that here. Can you hold onto this for me? Wow. You really cleaned up. I know. What are you doing later? Writing thank-you cards. Do you wanna come to a party with me? No. Please. Why? See ya. Bye. 'Cause I would do it for you. Bored yet? It's better than a lot of parties we've been to this summer. Hey, what's up? I remember you. You girls need a drink? It's a party, not a funeral. It's okay. I'll get it. What's your name? Chiara. Devon. Nice to meet you. I like the way you sparkle. You look like a pink disco ball. Yo. - Hey. Every time I see you, you look different. Yeah, I just came from a thing. Chiara's thing. Right, right, right. Fun? Yeah. Mmm. Um. It doesn't work that way. Whoa. Look at that. What's that about? I don't want to lose it. No? It's kind of over, but I'm just holding onto it. That's too bad. Um- here. Just do it. I hate being sick. It'll sober you up. Ew, it smells so bad. Oh, gross. I'm gonna call a car service. Why? It's early. I'm not drunk. I'm just hot. I- I can't. Open your mouth. Why? I'll do it. Why? Open your mouth. There's puke in your hair. Get it off me. No. Do it yourself. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you wanna go again? Like- I don't understand, man. Bro, what the fuck? What about your dick? Thanks a lot, Devon. Thanks a lot, man. I always got you, bro. I gotta, gotta be up at 6:00 A.M. Can you set my alarm? Am I your mother? Hi. Where are you going? Work. Sucks. Yeah. - Please don't do that. - I don't mind. It's my fucking mess. I said stop it. I spent the night with this guy last night. Who? He's a friend of a friend. Is he your boyfriend? No, but it's kind of better than a boyfriend, you know? No. It's kind of more exciting. That sounds too exciting. It's hard to describe. Are you just getting home? My dad's gonna kill me. Maybe you should go. I will. What're you gonna tell him? I don't think I can lie. That would just make it worse. If you hear screaming, call the cops. Shut up. I'm serious. Just tell him you were at Chiara's, or something. You're really late. It's really early. Don't bullshit me. What are you gonna do, punish me? No. If you don't give a shit, I don't give a shit. Don't you wanna know where I was? - No. Stop trying to pique my interest. Chiara's? Nate's? I was with this guy. - Who? You don't know him. You don't have a guy that I don't know about. If you did, believe me, I would know. Hang that up when you take it off. I don't want to see it crumpled up in the corner of your room. Please. Fine. You've reached the offices of the president of the United States. No, I'm playing. This is Sammy. If I call you back, I call you. If I don't, then, oh well. Hi. Yo. I- - What do you want? I called you before. I'm working. - I figured. What's up? - You know. What? Look, I'd love to hang, but I'm kind of busy. My dad freaked that I came home so early. He'll get over it. - I hope so. He will. Do you mind if I hang here? That's not such a good idea. I really don't think I could be high enough to pass out, then fuck you, and not remember it. We were really drunk. Do you get what I'm saying? But you have had that happen before, right? Hi. Sorry about the other night. I just didn't want you to do something stupid. I know. Did you do something stupid? I don't know. It's kind of a blur. How blurry? Did you sleep with him? I don't know. Maybe. Is everything okay? I'm gonna see if I can get you an appointment. Please don't. No. This is not okay. You don't know where he's been. Please don't. I'm sure it's fine. I'm gonna take out the speculum now, so I need you to take a deep breath. It's a bit early for the first pap smear. We usually don't do them until the patient is sexually active, or until after the patient turns 21. At your age, I would recommend... Um, an hpv vaccine. Your gown is on backwards. Can I ask you a few questions? - Sure. Do you smoke? At parties. How many alcoholic beverages do you consume in a week? Like 60 ounces a week. Do you remember to wear your seat belt... Every time you get into a car or taxi? I try. And how often do you menstruate? - I don't know. Monthly? Maybe. Every two months? Sounds right. Would you like to be tested for stds? - No. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, cancer or heart disease in your family? Yes. Which? Cancer. Who, and what kind? Mom. Breast cancer. At what age was she diagnosed? - I don't remember. Alive or deceased? Deceased. I would like you to consider participating... In a surveillance program at some point in the next few years. Are there any questions I can answer for you today... About your personal or sexual health? Lila, is there a reason you came in today... For emergency contraception? I think the nurse made a mistake. You've reached the offices of the president of the United States. No, I'm playing. This is Sammy. If I call you back, I call you. If I don't, then, oh well. What are you doing here? What do you think she's doing here? Your mom let me in. I think she's here 'cause she wants your dick. She can suck my dick. You never shower. She don't want... Your smelly little stinky dick. I think she wants to suck all our dicks. She only likes to pretend to suck your dick. I'll do it. It's gonna be a little hard to do standing up. Go on. Come on, puppy, sit. Sit. Did you decide who you're gonna do first? Pick me. Do you like it? Do you like it? Do you like my dick? It doesn't like you. What do you want? What's wrong? Oh, come on. What's wrong? What's wrong? Yeah. Yeah. It's all right.
