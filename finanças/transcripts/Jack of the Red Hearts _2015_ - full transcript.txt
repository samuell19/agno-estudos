- Come here. - Okay. We did it. We did it! - Yeah! Whoo! - Whoo! Miss me? It took you forever to get me. Worst part? Best part? There is no best part. That family sucked. You should be with me. I'm family. I'm 18 now. Glory. Glory, honey, come on. It's time for sleep. - Glory. Come on, sweetie pie, it's time to go to sleep. - No! - It's time for sleep. Come on. - No! - No! - Come on, listen to Mommy. Come on, sweetie. It's okay. She's down. I can't keep on moving these balances around, it's... Just think about all the money we save. Never having help before, me doing everything myself. I'm sorry. That makes it sound like I don't do anything and I happen to be... I work, okay? What the hell do you think I do all day? Get my nails done. Talk about boys. Yeah, well, you know, it's not like I dreamt about being an IT guy. At least you're out in the world. I'm "out in the world"? I work in a cubicle, Kay. A cubicle. - A cubicle? - Yeah. - A cubicle sounds heavenly. - Really? You have no idea what I do all day. No, I don't have any idea what you do all day, because you don't tell me what you do all day. I mean, are we gluten free this week? "Yes, we're gluten-free this week. " Well, then why the hell is she having Sun Chips? Because sometimes you just have to avoid a total meltdown. Glory, stop. You see this face? This is Daddy's angry face. Time to sleep, Glory. I guess I'll sleep in here, okay. U.2.T... Hey, when do I get my tattoo? You can't handle it. You're afraid of paper cuts. Hey, she's like my twin. Yeah. Totally. Exactly like you. Hey, support the Red Cross. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Two... - Two... Forty cents... Two dollars and forty-two cents... I'm hungry. Shut it, Coke. We don't got enough yet. Do you think I'll look like Mom when I grow up? Sure. Of course. I think I'm starting to forget Momma now. Coke, she's only been gone a couple of years. - Him? - Yeah, go. Hey, this, sir, is for the Red Cross. Dick. What's it say? "Are you good with kids?" - What do you think? - I'm not a kid. - I'll be back. - Where do you think you're going? - Get on the rocks, Coke, and what? - Chill. Exactly. I'll be back. Thanks, babe. What is this, the third or fourth family she's pulled you away from? And impersonating the Red Cross is a felony. Did she tell you that? You want to end up like your sister? Where is she? Jack! No. Coke. Hey! Hey, Max! Sit! Sit, sit. Sit! Lay down. Lay down. Good boy. Yeah, good boy. Man. Yo, what up, girl? - Hey, Dais. - Where have you been? You been hiding somewhere? Where you been staying? Nowhere good. Squatting some with Jeremy and those kids. All right. Yo, wait. He ain't allowed inside. Relax, Dais, neither am I. Let's go. So where's Coke at? I thought you got her again. Shit. I did. But then my damn probation officer... She... She don't quit. Man, poor kid must have been terrified. Shit, if they place her, they gonna put her somewhere you can't find her. Who's the girl with the funky teeth? Got to be her little brother's guardian, you know? Yo, I don't remember. Tania. Tany... Yo, but it ain't enough to be 18. You got to have a real job. A real place to live, man. Well, that's what this is, see. "Room and board. " Shit. You still know that guy on staff at Hollygrove? You ain't bustin' her out of that place! No, just to call her and talk to her. Just give them a call, see if she's there. I suppose you want me to check on this too. Yeah. Set me up good, like we used to. All right. I'll call her... If you do something for me. Hello? Hi, I'm calling from an employment agency. I saw your flier. Thanks for calling but, you know, I think I found someone actually already. So... Yeah? Okay. But maybe just in case I could get your information. I mean, you never know. Well, she's coming at four today, so there's really no point, but, all right. Yeah, cool. What's the play? Okay, so her name is Kay Adams. She gonna interview another girl at four, okay? You get there first, head her off, take it over. Yeah, but you got to be super legit, okay? Like seriously. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You mean, like, when I played that door-to-door Bible selling gal. No, no, no. No, no. Like that art therapy chica. You know, the one from Hollygrove. Yeah, yeah. Or "Paint the feelings behind the feelings. " Donna, have you had problems with your voice messages before? I didn't get a message. I'm sorry. No, no, no. I'm sorry. We really wanted to save you the trip out here. Honey? Honey, I can't... Mark, is she hungry? Come on, let's go. Does she need tinkle? I think there was a little bit of a mix-up. You see, her husband already hired someone. But you know what, we are definitely gonna hang on to your resume in case she doesn't work out. Why am I even cleaning this mess up? This woman should know what she's getting herself into. Okay, who are you again? I'm... I'm Kay's cousin. - Donna? Hi. - Yeah. That's me. Is everything okay? Yeah. That was just my ride. I... I forgot my resume in the car, but I have it. Great. Come on in. Please, sit down. So can I get you some water? Tea? Shot of whiskey? Just kidding. You said you'd worked with autistic children before? Yeah, here. Is that the same as what you emailed me, yeah? Yep. Well, you know what they say, you can never be too prepared. You're my kind of person. Okay. Come on. Three years at the same daycare, and your supervisor spoke very highly of you. I checked your references. Very complimentary. So, sit down. - Tell me about yourself. - Tell me about you! When did you first find out that Glory was, differently abled? Please, no need to be politically correct around here. If she were "differently abled" I'd be thrilled. She was four. That must've been very hard for you. Just felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and served on a cracker. Other than that, it was fine. Now, as for you, you worked with autistic kids at the daycare? Yes. Absolutely. And are you more into ABA or Greenspan? Basically, I... I don't care what you call it. It's, whatever works for each child. That's good. I like that. And, tell me about Rebecca. Rebecca? Your supervisor said you had a very special bond with a little girl named Rebecca. Right, Rebecca. Sweet precious Becky. Ms. Appleby said she was a terror. Not to me she wasn't. Okay. That'll be Glory. Come on. No! - Slow down! Slow... - Glory. She's been in a tantrum the entire drive home. Honey, honey, Mark. This is Donna. - Hi, Mr. Adams. - Hey. - Sorry... - Do you want to go meet our little baby girl? Come on. Just as I thought. Sweetie. Can you say, "Hi, Donna"? Such a pretty girl. Say "Hi, Donna. " Bye, Donna. She meant to say hi. Trust me. She doesn't talk much? She can talk spontaneously when she wants to eat something, but... So is she like good at math or something? Glory's no Rain Man. No genius savant upside. But we like to think she has an exceptional personality. What you got there? So, what d'you think? Easy peasy, right? Yeah. So I start work on Monday. And I wanna get Glory used to you right away. So, just to double-check, you're available immediately, tomorrow? That'll give me a few days to show you "all things Glory. " Will you do it? She's adorable, and you both seem great. But, I really can't take a pay cut right now... Twenty dollars an hour. Yeah, maybe we can talk about this. There's nothing more we can do. - Yeah. - We really need the help right now. Well, you know, I'll make it work. Great! Okay, so, 8:00? Okay. - Sure. Tomorrow. - Yeah. Tomorrow. Bye, Donna. Honey, I finally get to go back to work. I really, really wish you had talked to me first. Honey, don't be a downer. Okay, everybody raves about her. Hey. Hey. What are you dressed up like that for? Hey, I know you're not really mad at me, you're just trying to punish me. I am mad at you. But I'm 18 now. If they get me it won't be juvie anymore. It'd be real jail with really bad people. But you are a bad person. Come on, Coke. Don't say that. I'm doing my best. And no one's supposed to call me Coke anymore. What? Jack and Coke is "not appropriate. " Who said that? Elizabeth say that? Jack and Coke goes with good times. That's you and me, right? Good times! Excuse me? Hey? Okay. I got a job. I'm getting us a place. Just don't buy into the bullshit. Okay. ABA. Applied Behavior, Behavioral Analysis Therapy. It's like, giving treats as rewards and shit. Yep. You're a pro. "Stimming?" Yeah. It's like doing something over and over again, to stimulate yourself. Girl, I do that all the time. You do it too! Okay, so how's the dad like? I got it. And the mom? That bitch is wack. Shit. Man, I got no choice. I gotta stick it out. - Okay. - How's this look? Hello? Didn't tell you they had a son, did they? Don't be silly. - Welcome, Donna. This is our son, Robert. - Thanks. Robert, be nice. So, It's not Bob. Not Robbie. Just Robert, okay. Okay. You gonna let me in, Robert? Are you here to save the day? Wah-wah! Wah-wah! Donna? Donna, in here. This is your cell phone. All our numbers are already... See? - Just so you know. - Thank you. And, as for computer, you can use the one in the kitchen. So what d'you say, we start in 10 minutes? Sure, yeah. That's great. In here. Hi, Glory. Look who's here, Glory. Can you say "Hi, Donna"? Hi, Donna. Progress. You got a "hi. " - All right, let's start in the kitchen. - Okay. She aspires to the empyrean. Her supplements. The digestive enzymes are especially important... They create the most potent effluvium. Robert, you'll be late for school. Out, out, out. So, she takes all of these in one day? Dude. Dude. Dude. You're not gonna guess this. My sister's new babysitter is hot. - Hell no. - Unequivocally, man. I'm not even kidding. She's... She's a blazing beauty. Like, she's... I open the door... Her eyes were so captivating. How hot are we talking, like a solid nine, ten piece? No, dog, I'm talking 12, 15... Twelve, 15? I'm talking 12, 15. And, dog, she just graduated college so she's like, -25, 26? I don't know. - What, 26? She's a woman, dog. She's not a girl. - You gotta go for it. - I plan to, man. Dude, you got to hook me up with that. I... I have the car. First. I've managed to get Glory an interview with this amazing new school. It's a... It's a long shot because frankly, well... But her public school doesn't challenge her enough. Or, at all. So the interview's in a month. Well, a little more than a month. Does that sound like a good short-term goal? - Yeah. - Ta-da. This is your Bible. I tried to write everything down but it's impossible. You're just gonna have to pay attention and follow me around. You're gonna keep a record of everything in this book. Diet. Very important. Casein-free, gluten free. We've... We've had some issues. Let's just say, if your kid goes for almost two weeks without a bowel movement, it's time to go to the for a poop extraction. Good times. Let's get her in the car. - Hi. This is... This is Donna. - Hi. Hi, Donna. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You got this. You know what to do. Go ahead. Glory's logbook. Right... - Here. I forgot... - Over here is fine. - Yeah. - And that's Glory's... Actually, I've got this. Come on, Glory. Let's go. Well, I never thought I'd, have to repeat the fourth grade again. I bet... So how's this, work? The first rule is we're not here to talk to each other. Okay, so under the "Chauffeur" tab, you'll see how to catch a ride from school to therapy with Parent Transit. I've scheduled it for every Tuesday and Friday. Hi. - This is Donna. - Hi. Pam is speech and language therapist. Hey. This is Donna. Matt. Occupational therapist. That kid has to wear those all the time. He can hear water running through the pipes. Lot of these kids have sensory issues. Autism pretty much sucks. Am I talking too much? I haven't had anyone to talk to in years. This is fun. Kay! Hey, How are you? Elaine, hi! Hi, Glory! We should go through this. Glory, what do you say? Hi, Donna. This is Donna, Glory's new companion. Glory, you get a new friend. So, how's Danny? How's... How's everything? He's great. We mainstreamed him last year. Although he's still brushing up on some articulation with Pam... He's... He's totally recovered? Well... He'll be furious if I'm not here to pick him up on time, but that's most kids for ya. Gotta run. Recovered? Recovered? I mean, I'm happy for them, I am. But they did nothing and he's better. And we tried everything, and... I love you, girlie. I'd kill for you. Glory? Elphan. Say it better. - Elephant. - Good job, girlie. What's your favorite? Red one. Jelly bean! Jelly bean! Jelly bean! Okay, one more. She can do it when she's motivated. - And don't overdo it with the jelly beans. - Okay. Just enough to keep her attention. Thanks to the ABA we can get her attention at all. Yeah. And it's thanks to the ABA that we are so in debt. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars. - My gosh. - Youch. Thanks. That's... Try the red ones. Glory's favorite. - Mine too. It's really good. - Good. Let's wait for Mark. Okay. I'm sorry. - There you are. - Hey. Just in time to say grace. Excellent. Just dressing up for Sunday dinner. Thank you. I want tat-o's please. Thank you, dear Lord, for the food we are about to eat. For the hands that prepared it. - I want tat-o's please. - Thank you for... For Donna, the lovely woman who is about to be Glory's companion. - Thank you for our health... - I want tat-o's please. ...and Glory's continued development. Amen. And for Robert and his good friend Dudley. And for my job. We thank you. Amen. - Amen. - So how are things in your life, boys? Everybody's raving about how great State's gonna be. It'll be fine, honey. - Glory, no. - Wonderful. It'll be swank. It'll be cool. We got my car. Your car? He's not driving your car. - I want 'tat-o's please. - Glory! I want my 'tat-o's. Donna, the whole point is for her to talk. Not punish her for it. Donna. Mark, could you... Come here, sweetie. It's all right. Glory, sweetie. It's okay. She's accustomed to taking things of our plates. It's the only time we can have any adult conversation. What a total con. Exactly. I mean... Your compliance only reinforces her manipulation, Kay. That... That's all. This is exactly what I've been saying for years. Now suddenly everyone's an expert when I'm the one who's... No. I mean, she has a point, does she not? Go on, sweetie. Let's go to the kitchen. We're having dinner. I don't understand. Nice work, Dad. Excuse me? I was agreeing with you. No, you were agreeing with her. I'm sorry, Donna. It's okay. I'll eat in the living room. Thank you. We can do everything the same. Just with Donna, okay? She's been friends with other girls like you. And Mommy will be home by six, so... Everything's gonna be fine. I mean, you got to give them a taste of their own medicine, right? Maybe you should study the natives a little while before you try and evangelize them. Does he always talk like that? Yeah. I don't though. You know, I'm chill. So, Donna, tell us about yourself. You go to college? Yeah. Where did you, where did you go to college? Yeah. It must have been fun. What did you study? Like, can you buy alcohol? - Dude, shut up! - Do you have friends in the area? I'm gonna go eat with your dad. Where do you party? I have a Cadillac if you wanna go for a ride in it some time. Wait. Where... Damn. Dude, yo, bro, I swear if you don't, I will. Your mom just, I don't know... I thought maybe if you... I mean, you wanna talk or something? No. I don't. Look, Robert... Dad, I'm busy right now. You need something? No. All right, then. I'll be upstairs if you need me. One of the moms at Sing-and-Swing recommended her. And how old is she? I don't know. Graduated college a couple years ago. Early twenties? - Where did she graduate? - Community college. What's with the gazillion questions? We need her. - Eat your breakfast before... - I already ate. Dudley's gonna be here in five. What? No. Donna? Donna? Door's locked. Are you up? Donna? Hi... Not ready? I have allergies... First day, remember, under the "Weekly Schedule" tab. You take full charge of Glory about 30 minutes before I go to work... Put clothes on. Chop-chop. Honey, honey. Relax, okay. Everything's gonna be fine. This is not the impression I wanna make on my first day at work. I understand that, but you're gonna be fine. Glory's gonna be fine. - Everybody... - Nothing is fine unless I make it fine. Hey. - No, can you just... God. - Okay, okay, okay... Peace be among everybody. Mommy loves you, okay? Eyes. Eyes. Mommy's eyes. You be good. - Be good. - Yes, I'll be good too. At least I'm gonna try. This will help. Here... Call me, okay? Anything at all, just... Of course, yeah. And work on her teens, or... Okay. Don't worry. Just go already. We're cool. ...Glory. I'll see you soon. You be good. Not too many jelly beans, okay? Okay. Okay Glory. Come on, let's go. Hey, let's go. Come on, let's go. What's wrong with you? Hey, okay, here's the deal. You don't rat on me, I don't rat on you. Got it? Let's go. Come on, Glory. Look, the bus is here. Shit, we're on the short bus. Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Short bus! Hey, see. A. A. See? Look. That's what it looks like. Do this. It works. - Seriously? - It does. I think, Scotty took your logbook. Scotty? Scotty? Okay. Okay, so I'm saying we did your teens and your... Your sequence picture cards. Good. All right. That's gross. What's wrong with you? Don't move, all right? Glory! No, no, no, no, no, no! What the hell! Okay, so just stay... Okay, don't move. I'm going to get you down, okay? Don't move. How did you get up there? Don't move, okay. Glory! Stay where you are, all right? There's some sick party's at State. We can't party. They're going to know we're 17. Think things through, man. Who's gonna buy us the liquor in the first place? Two words. Donn-a. My God! Dude, stop the car. Just stay... Shit! Are you seeing this? My God in heaven! Nice going! I got her. Sorry! - You missed the... - I didn't see the ladder. ...the bright yellow ladder. I didn't see it, but... It's all right. Happens to the best of us. We were just taking a break. Jeez, Bob. She doesn't get how to move backwards. She never learned to crawl. She can't alternate her limbs like that. But you knew that, right? Hello. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Shape is a diamond. - What are you doing up here? - Shape is a diamond. - What? Yeah, it's a diamond. I see it. I see it. - Diamond... - You can't be up here, sweetie. - Diamond... - We gotta get down, okay? You ready to go? Come on. I'll walk. I know you've done this a million times. Come on, Glory. Come on. Slowly... One foot, two foot. There we go. - Fourteen. - Fourteen. - Fifteen. - Fifteen. I did it! I did it! It all came back to me. Making calls, problem solving, spreadsheet. Hi, Robert. Glory went roof-walking today. I forgot to warn you about that. Yeah. No. I told you, it's something about being a Pi, the empyrean. She loves it. Never falls. You a narc, Bobert? Getting a tan? I could have mentioned that. This is Mommy's happy face! Happy! Happy! Are you gonna mess with "happy happy"? Mommy's, Mommy's happy face. Happy face. Happy, happy, happy face. Happy, happy, happy face. You completed two full sequence pictures? Did you really complete two or did you try two? We completely tried two, but, you know, we'll do better tomorrow. Right, Glory? Knock-knock. You draw all these yourself? They're really good. - What's that? - Nothing. It's nothing. So, I got your room, and you got this man-cave. I haven't been up there in a while. You got a problem with me, Robert? Because, you know, the first time I saw you I thought maybe we could be friends. You know, I'm just here to help out Glory. And I know your parents need my help too, so... Maybe we can try to get along. For their sake? - Okay. Yeah. - You know... I could help you out too. With like your homework or something? Okay, what... What college did you go to again? Remind me? I forget. God, you're such an asshole. And what's with that "Wah-wah" crap, anyway? What? Are you serious? Helen Keller's first word, "Wah wah. " Helen Keller, Anne Sullivan... W- A-T-E-R. I thought Anne Sullivan was like a patron saint to all you therapists. Yeah. Well, knock it out, Bobert. You look retarded. You know, you're not supposed to use that word. Stop! Stop! Shit. Glory... Shut up. Glory, no. Glory! Glory, I... Just do it! It's okay, it's okay. Glory, come on, you know this. No, don't do that to me. Get up, it's not noodle time. - Noodle. - Get up. Glory, come on. What is this shape? - What is this shape? - Glory, what is this shape? - What is this shape? - What is this shape? You know this shape. Glory, come on. Get back up here, come on. - What is this shape? - Glory! Calm down, all right? Hey, just calm down, okay? Stop kicking! What happened? What happened? - Where's the theratube? - I don't know! - The theratube? - What?.. - Her chew stick! Remember, we went over this! - Yeah. - Sorry. Okay. - She needs something to chew on while we're getting her dressed. Okay. Sweetie, there you go. Good girl. Good girl. All right, we went over this! Panties, undershirt, then pants, then shirt. Don't ask me why the order matters but it does. Okay? All right. I'm sorry. That's a good girlie. All right. Get in your pants, and what are we going to do now? Glory, stop. - Glory. - Donna! This is a class, not a circus! Glory! Cut it out. Jesus! God! Let's go! - All right. - Shape is a diamond. ...is a diamond. Diamond... Stop. Hey. Hey. Stay! Be good. I'll be back. Hello? - Jack? - Shit! You. Inside. Hey, how's it going, Elizabeth? - It's going good. - Yeah. It's good to see you. You look good. You've completely transformed, I see. - Thanks. - After you. Okay, I'm going to tell you one thing. Your probation officer says you're in violation. And I'm instructed to call her if you even come around here. Come on, Elizabeth, don't call Miz! I'm going to call her right now, unless you talk, and I want only the truth. You're going to place Coke. Yes, again. It won't be hard. She's a cute kid. Can't you at least give Coke her computer privileges back? So you two can plan your next great escape? No way! But that's not fair. She should be with me. I'm her family. I'm, I'm 18 now. I got a job, I got a place. I said, "Only the truth. " No. That is the truth! I'm working as a babysitter for a little girl. And she's autistic, so she needs someone with her like all the time. And the pay is good. How did you even get this job? I convinced them. You lied to them. No. No, I'm doing a good job! And they really like me. It's easy. I can get you a recommendation letter! With their contact information on it? Yeah. Yeah... Hey. See! See! Look! Look. It's real. See? How long have you been doing this? I don't know. Not long. One month from now, you still have this job, we'll talk about maybe keeping you two together. No! Shit! No, shit! Glory? Glory? Hey! Shit. Glory? Glory? Glory? No! Damn! Shit! God! Where were you? You got to say something, damn it! Hi. Mani-pedi time! - Want one? - No. I'm okay. Thanks. My God, what's wrong with your hands? What happened? I just fell. It's no big deal. I smell cigarettes. Do you smell cigarettes? Glory. Glory, not now. Say something, damn it! Can you watch Glory for a moment? Where's Donna? I think she has personal problems. Apparently, she didn't make it to Sing-and-Swing at all today. I mean, where the hell were they? And the other day I think she lied about what they accomplished. Right... Look, but... She just started! Why don't you just give her a break? - Give her a break? - Yeah. Have you seen her with Glory? She's rough with Glory. You should have seen her hands. I mean, I think she's hiding something. I'm going to make some calls tomorrow. What, are you're gonna quit your job? With one-on-one attention Glory should be showing some improvement by now! Well, God forbid it's Glory's fault she's showing no improvement! What did you just say? She's not going to be ready for that interview. Never! She's 11 years old, Kay. When are you going to get that through your head? Is this is how you really feel about Glory? I'm tired. I don't want to feel like we're co-workers in a mental hospital! I want to feel like we're married again. Glory? Hey, come on, you can chew on this. Come on. Almost ready for school. Come on. Hey. Girl, sit up. You're really worth every penny, Donna. Now my parents aren't even speaking to each other. Glory, hey. You know what? I'm thinking you're no Anne Sullivan. Glory... Watch out. Roll over. W- A-T-E-R. Water! It has a name! W- A-T... Wa... Wa... Okay, Glory. No more free jelly beans. No more cigarette breaks. Your ass is mine now, okay. Glory, no Glory, sit! Glory, sit...! Stop. Hey, good stop. That was a good stop. That was a good stop. Okay. Stay. Yeah. Okay. Good. I'm going to take your cards. I'm taking these back. You'll get them back after. It's okay. It's okay. Just take your spoon. Try with a spoon. Try with a spoon. No, no, no, no! It's okay. Here, try another one. Don't freak out. Glory, it's okay. Come on. Hey, no, no, no, no, no! No! Glory, hey, calm down. It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you, okay? Come on, let go. Come here! Calm down! It's okay. Okay? Just take a break. All right. Good. We're going to try this with a spoon. We'll do it together, okay? In your mouth. One more time. Come on. Glory come on, it's just sweet potatoes. They taste good. No, no.! Come here! Come on! Donna. Glory. I'm home. - We're in here. - Hi. There you are. We're out of yams. Look, improvement! She's sitting down. She's eating with her spoon. Show mommy, honey. Glory. Eat. Eat. Glory. Eat. Good job, girlie. Give me five. - How. - How. This better be cleaned up. Yeah, yeah. Thank you, girlie! Thank you! Finally. What else can you do, girlie? Glory, you in here? - Hey, Kay. - Hi. I am so sorry I'm calling so late. Is Glory bouncing off the walls? She's good. Good... Donna, listen, I... I know this is not part of our deal, but this audit. No, it's okay. Just spit it out. It's fine. Is there any chance you could help with dinner? Forget it, forget it. I shouldn't have asked. No, it's fine! I just, I don't know how to cook. No, not anything elaborate, just make spaghetti or something. How do you make spaghetti? Okay, I'll just walk you through it. All right, okay. So what's the first step? Okay, so there's a pot... Watch your step. There she is. Hey, Bethany. Bethany. Come here. I've a couple of people I'd like you to meet. Just give her a little time, she's been through a lot. Well, I looked online and I gotta get my classes in by the end of the month. We gotta figure out what dorm room I'm staying in. Focus on some work study. Get some money in there. What do you think about food too? The food at these colleges is terrible. I mean, you've seen what those kids eat, we can't. We're gonna have to get you something healthy. I need to figure out where I'm staying, not what I'm gonna eat... They'll tell you where you're staying. This food is delicious. Yeah, quinoa's really high in protein. Really? - I did know that. - I need more. I need more. Give me more. - Here, protein. - Delicious. Glory? What's she saying? I don't know. We haven't figured that one out. We think it has something to do with the conflict in the Middle East! Or maybe she's saying, "Daddy's really fat! Daddy's really fat!" - Daddy's not fat. - Daddy sometimes is fat. I want tatos please. I want tatos please. - Good asking, Glory! - I want tatos please. Okay. Here you go. - This is awesome! - Pretty awesome! - I want tatos please. - This is amazing. I just gave you some. Okay. Who's that? Mommy. Mommy. Good. Good. And who's that? Hey. Who's that? That's you, Glory. That's you. That's you. No, I'm Jack. I'm Jack. You're Glory, I'm Jack. Glory. Glory. Glory. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. - No, no, no, no. Donna. Donna. Donna. - Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack. Jack. Jack. It's been open for about three months. Well, you know, it was modeled after a lab school at the University of Chicago, which I toured. So, you know. ABA, everything... All under one roof! I know. Are you guys talking about that new school? Glory has an interview there. Glory got an interview? Are you kidding? Why? Not exactly her speed, if you know what I mean. No. I don't know what you mean. I mean, she's low functioning. She'll never get in. Gosh. Good luck. I'm afraid she'll need it. Come on, Glory. Low functioning, my ass. Yo girl, this place is crazy. What's with all of this? Yo Daisy, hold on. I just gotta... All right, just sit. Just sit right there. Stay. I'm going to go and pick some stuff out for you, okay? Don't move. Yo, this shit is wack. What up? See? It's like a survival kit, you know, for when the lights are too bright, when it's too noisy and shit... And this too. - Why? - Because it's fun. Okay, I gotta fly. Bye, boo-boo. Hey, Dais? Live big. Hey. Glory? Glory? Hey, Glory? This isn't funny. Excuse me, did you see a little girl? - Yeah. She just left. - What? Shit! Glory? Glory? Glory? Have you seen a little girl? Hi... I lost Glory. All right, just stop the car. Stop, stop. - I'm so sorry. I just looked away for a second... - No, no, no. - She just takes off. I understand. - Okay. Where could she be? I got an idea. Come on. Dudley, come on. No, she goes to this park sometimes. It's like her little happy place. There she is! See, I told you. She loves it here. Shit, she's gonna fall. No, she's fine dude. She's safe. She never falls. Yo, check out who it is. - Shit... - Yo, Robby. - You want me to help you? - No. Just wait here and watch Glory. - Hey, guys. - How's it going, man? Long time, no see? Who are those guys? They look like assholes to me, I don't know. You said you were gonna matriculate in the State, man. Yeah. I, I didn't get into the other ones, so we're just kind of... No way. Hey, Glory. How the hell did you get up here? You're like a little red-headed ninja. What about Yale? Princeton? Same thing. I got waitlisted. Dude... Pathetic. What happened to you? What happened? Hey, baby... Come on, let's go. - Later. - Wait, wait. What was that? Annoying is what it was, I mean, Princeton, Yale, who gives a shit? Yeah. - Who does? - Guys, guys! Glory just talked to me! - What'd she say? - What? Okay. So, I was talking to her and I asked her how many fingers I was holding up, and she said four and I was actually holding up four fingers! Alert the media, dude. She does that all the time. Hi, Jack. Hijack? See. She's just babbling. No, she actually was talking to me. - I'm telling you, man, she's just babbling. - She's never done that before. Now four? - Four. - Yeah. Four. There's something weird... I don't know about being up high. It's like it makes her smarter or something up there. That thing you said the first day, the... - The empyrean. - Yeah. It's like reaching at the highest point of the heavens. She's reaching for the stars. That's our Glory. Thanks, by the way, for not giving me shit. We've all done it. Seriously, it's all right. And... Thanks for that. Yeah. Mom and Dad would jump at the latest thing, spare no expense when it came to Glory. Any gadget, any quack who had the cure. The compounding pharmacy designer digestive enzymes... ...the trips to the hyperbaric oxygen chamber... And the one thing I wanted was the amazing ab electrifier. Yes. I wanted it very badly. And they said no. And I couldn't believe it! They said it was a gimmick and everything. I was 13! I wanted the amazing ab electrifier. Yeah. Those guys were my friends up until my parents couldn't afford to take me to McAllister's anymore. So I started going to public school, and... Dudley? Exactly. So does this mean you're going to stop calling me Bobert now? Maybe. Glory, I'm home. I... Glory, come on. Hey, Glory, come on. Dudley, okay, it happened man. Just... Just a few minutes ago. - It was like... - Dude, that's statutory rape! You're going to put her in jail. We're not having sex, man. Just get your head out of the dirt. This is... This was a moment. This was real. This was us. I kissed a woman! Okay. But if she's in jail, how are we going to get the booze for the party? This was just... Okay, you're not getting this. I can't talk to you right now. I'll see you tomorrow. Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Okay, how many more days? Nineteen. Shit! Stupid! - Hey. - Okay, okay. This is completely inappropriate and it stops now. - What do you mean, we were just... - The park... That was totally my fault. I was just trying to help you out, but... The second time, the swings, that was... That was totally you. Okay, well, we need a tiebreaker. - What? - A tiebreaker. One more? All right. Yeah. Okay... All right. Okay, that should hold you, Robert. Hero. Hero. Glory. - Hey, Glory. - How did you know that? Hero. She heard it all the way from the kitchen. - I can't believe it. - It's a special song. - Hero. - I'm getting there. Ready? I can't put a shield around your heart When you're wishing you are anywhere but where you are I wish I could surround you Pick you up and carry you away Pick you up and fly you away Ready? We all know I'm no... Hero But my intentions are true And at the end of a long day I feel my power in my love for you Let me see if I remember this next verse. I'd catch your tears when you're falling When you need a hand I'll be around I'd like to travel to your hard times Stop the clocks and make them mine Ready? We all know I'm no hero But my intentions are true And at the end of a long day I feel my power in my love for you I feel my power in my love for you I feel my power in my love for you I feel my power in my love... For you I know, you almost got it. We just have one more arm. Come on. We're almost there. I know. - Having some trouble? - Yeah. Almost. Hey, let's try this. Hey, Glory, squishy time. Squishy time! Let me try this, okay. Yeah, lay down. She loves this. - Squish, squish. - Yeah, come on. Lay down. Works every time. We can do this any time of the day. Ready? Yes? We're going to wrap you up like a cheese roll. You're going to look like a burrito, with rice and beans. And then we're going to lift you up. Lift up her legs. And we're gonna swing you, right? Say one, two... Three... Squishy! I got you! Squishy! Squishy! - Squishy! Squishy! - Squishy! Squishy! - Squishy! - You get her cozy. It doesn't have to be all work and therapy. You can try this. She likes Casper. I don't understand the mysterious power of Casper, the Friendly Ghost, but... See you later. Take care of her. Casper? Okay. - In the spice cabinet. - Cabinet. Spice cabinet. - Which cabinet is that? - Left of the dishwasher. - Eye level. - What's it look like? Low sodium beef? Yeah, got it. Found it. - How many? - Just one. One. Yeah, I got it. Okay. What else? I don't know. What else have you got? Tomato? Yeah. I'll get the tomatoes. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Too loud? No, I... I just couldn't sleep. Come sit down. You like the book? I love it. Thank you so much. It's great. It really helps. I'm going to get some... Something to drink. A fraud. What? That's what I feel like. I've been out of the workforce too long. Everything's different. Nobody takes notes on actual paper anymore! They don't even talk on the phone, everything is emailing. I just don't know the tech stuff like these kids all do. Half the time I don't even know what they're talking about. I just feel like I'm faking it all day long. Well, I'm sure you're doing the best you can. Night. Good night, Donna. Gil, here's Mr. Riley. Good save. See you tomorrow. Say "See you tomorrow," Scotty. Bye, Scotty. What is it? Red. - Good. - Red. What's the shape? What is the shape? The shape is a heart. What's the card? What's the card? Is it jack? Jack... Jack of the red hearts. Good. Good. Yeah. Whoo! Jelly beans! Jelly beans! Hi, there. Is this, is this Elizabeth Dunn from Hollygrove? Hey, there. Okay. This is gonna sound really weird, but do you know a... A Jacquelyn Ferguson? All right, this is fine. Thanks. All right, Glory, we're here. Come on. Come on. I got you. Let's go. Yeah. Good girl. Good girl. Come on. Thanks. I know it's bright. It'll be cool inside. Come on. Glory, come on. Hey. We're just going to do this, okay? We're just going to go over here. Yeah. I'm going to talk with this lady and you, play with the fish. All right? Hi... I have these forms and I just wanted to find out where I... Who I turn them in to. No! No! No! - No! No! - Glory, Glory. Glory. Stop, stop, stop, stop... - No! No! No! No! No! No! - Stop it. Stop it, stop. Don't hurt yourself. - No! No! - Get your hands off that child! - What are you doing? - It's okay, she's autistic. - She's just having a tantrum... - Little girl, are you okay? - No! - Don't touch her. I'm her companion, okay? - She doesn't speak! - No. No. - No. - What's your name! No. What's your name? It's Donna... Excuse me, room 203 please? 203? Thank you. - Honey, are you scared? - Scared. - Are you hurt? - Hurt. It's... It's called echolalia, miss. I saw this young lady holding the girl's arms very roughly... Yes, and she probably saved her from... From running off. Glory's stronger than she looks. I... I have absolute confidence in our helper here. Okay, Donna, let's go. I'm sorry we've wasted your time. You take my daughter to Family and Children's Services? Do you know what those people can do? Is there something we've done that you disagree with? Do you feel Glory's not being treated well? It has nothing to do with you, Kay. It has nothing to do with this. I just don't want you to not like me. What could possibly... Listen, we... We all have made our mistakes, we all have our regrets. I know I didn't make Glory autistic. But... But when I started to see signs that something's wrong, I... I just couldn't face it. The only thing... The only thing everyone agrees on is... Is early intervention. The most crucial years. And I missed it. Where would Glory be if we'd started earlier? Would she... Would she be able to relate? Would she have friends? Would she call me Mommy? What can I do about it now? Except my best, now... It doesn't help her if I beat myself up over it. Now tell me, what were you doing at Family and Children's Services? I have a sister. Okay. We were in foster care after my, mom got sick. And, my mom, she didn't have anybody. Any family. So, after she... Yeah. We... We didn't have anybody either. She died? Yeah. The last thing she said to us was, "You two take care of each other. " It's like our... It's like our code, you know. U.2.T.C. So, that's... That's why I was here. I got to get my sister back. I'm sorry, honey. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna get your sister back. I'm gonna help you. Okay. Okay. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Okay. Hey. Whose is that? Donna, come on. Let's go. Just... I am so sorry, Mr. Adams. It's a lifelong pattern. She's smoking cigarettes. She's smoking cigarettes in the house! No concern for the law. Child endangerment. Criminal trespassing. - Honey? - Theft. - Breaking and entering. - Honey? In here. Donna's room. I can explain. - Is that your wife? - Yeah, that's my wife. What are you all doing in Donna's room? That's not her name, Mom. What? Excuse me, who are you? I'm her probation officer. Probation officer? Hello, Jacquelyn. Been looking for you. Jacquelyn? Whatever she told you, it's not the whole truth. I swear I can explain... Mrs. Adams, I've been sharing some of Jack's criminal record with your husband. - Criminal record! - Criminal record? We're lucky we found her in time, otherwise she could have done some serious harm to your daughter. Harm? - All I did was help them... - You think this is a joke? This is our family! Glory is part of our family... - It's not like what she says. - She says you're 18! She never graduated from high school. But her credentials! I... I check... I checked her references, remember... You checked Donna Graham's references. This isn't Donna Graham. Misrepresenting your identity, it's called Fraud. No, I did the job! Okay! You need to look for missing checks and also credit cards. What, you mean like this? That... That was just an old check. Then what the hell is it doing in your room? For what? I didn't use it! I didn't use it for anything. - I swear to God, I didn't do anything! - You lied? - You're not even a therapist? - No. The part about my sister is true! You're not a caretaker... The whole daycare, everything was a lie? I'm sorry. I just... I needed to get a job because I need to get custody of my sister, that's all. What sister? Well, fortunately, her sister has been placed with a foster family. No! No! No! No! No. No. No... - Glory. - No. No. Glory! You can't stay with me, Glory. - Glory. Come on. - No! You played us! I didn't mean to... Robert, what about her interview? - You can drop the act, all right! - No! No! So what would you put in the Big Dipper? In the Big Dipper... I'd put... Tequila! Tequila. Really. Well, we better have lots of salt and lime in the Little Dipper. What would you put in the Big Dipper, Tina? Let's see, what do I like that much? Coffee! Then the Little Dipper better be full of cream!.. Speaking of which, let me go grab my coffee! I'll be right back. My God! Jack! - Hey. Hey. - Hey! - They wouldn't let me e-mail! But I knew you'd find me! - It's okay. - I'll grab my stuff and come to the back... - Wait, wait. Worst part, best part. Worst part? These assholes make me take vitamins at every... Hey. That's good! That's what good assholes do. Best part? Premium channels! They seem nice. And there are good schools around here. - School is bullshit! - No. No, I only said that 'cause of me... 'Cause I was full of shit. But you're good at school. Look, Coke, I'm not taking you with me. But U.2.T.C.! - I know, Coke. - U.2.T.C.! Coke, this is taking care of you, okay. Didn't you get us a place? No. No, I didn't. I'm sorry. You'll stay here. Okay. Okay, and they'll let us keep in touch. Yeah. And you can tell me all about what you're learning. What fun you're having. How many friends you're making. - No! No! - Hey, it'll be good. No, please, Please! Please. Jack, take me with you! Please just take me... Please take me. Take me. Jack! Go, go, go. Shake this. There you go. There you go. Shit, yo, my girl is back! Come dance, girl. Come and dance. Come and dance. Come. Come. No, Glory! Glory! - I'll pick it up. - Just... I'll pick it up. - Glory. Okay. - I'll get the... I'll just get the theratube. You know what, Mark, let's just cancel it, okay? - This is not going to work! - Cancel? But she can really do this! What kind of flipping impression do you think she's going to make now? She's gonna do this. We're gonna do this. This is gonna be okay. She's gonna be okay, I promise. I want to be your... Kay? Mark? - Hi! - Welcome to the Exceptional Academy. - I'm Doctor Molina. - Hi. This is Cynthia, the psychologist - who will be working with Glory today. - So nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Pleasure. - This must be Glory. - This is Glory. - Hi, Glory. Glory, go ahead. Say hi. - Welcome to our... - No! - No! No! - Sorry! It's okay, sweetie. She... Yeah, she's a little overwhelmed right now. - I'm sorry. There's so much going on. - That's all right. Why don't we all go together? - That would be great. - That would be great. Thank you. Come on. You can come. Let's go. It's okay. Who else is calling you? I'm right here. Dude, it's her. Dude. Hello? Dudley? I got to make this quick. I think the cops are here, but just... Just tell Robert that, that I need one more favor and I'll never ask for anything ever again, okay? Please? Yeah. Screw him. I'll... I'll do it. You idiot! I'm the one that told the cops she'd be there! And I'm the idiot? What's your name? My name's Cynthia. Can you say "Hi, Cynthia"? Glory, Glory, you can say "Hi Cynt... " - Kay. - Kay, Kay. Just... - Just let her be. - Okay. Hey, Officers, wait, I'm not armed, don't pepper spray me! How you guys doing? We're doing fine. What can we do for you? My name is Dudley. Pleasure to meet you. This is a new situation? ...Uncomfortable and scary. Come on. Now go do your thing. No. No! No! No! We just want to try to do this test with everyone the same. Okay. Right. You know, with all the kids... But every child is not the same. - I'm sorry, who are you? - She's... Hey, wait, could you just... - Can you give us one moment? - What do you mean? Just give me one... One second, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. Glory. Glory. What... What exactly are you doing? Kay, I'm helping. - You're helping? - Yeah. Right, like you've been doing in my house with my daughter! - With my son! - Listen. - I know... - No, you don't! No, you don't! You have no idea! Everything you told me was a lie! It wasn't all a lie. I swear. Just... Just the part that got me hired. Just that part. Okay. Just that part? And I'm turning myself in right after this, but please... My God. And I'll get my GED in jail. You don't just tell little fibs, your lies are extraordinary! Why should I believe anything you tell me? Because the cops are here for me. Right. But first, will you please just let me try this? Hi, I'm Jack. Glory's companion. Look, she... I just have some things in the bag for her, so... - Yeah. - Is that okay? - I think that's okay. - Yeah, sure. All right. Hey, Glory. Hey, girlie. How's it going? Hey. You missed me?

Give a red block to that lady. All right? Red. Yeah. The signs you're using, they're not ASL. No. I, I just picked them up working with, K-9 units. Actually, it was just, it was just one guard dog.

They made strides. She can be a lot more than she is if you give her a chance. If Glory isn't enrolled in your school this fall, do you wanna be wondering a year from now what happened to this little girl? Don't you wanna make a difference in her life? Yes, I do. I'm sorry.
