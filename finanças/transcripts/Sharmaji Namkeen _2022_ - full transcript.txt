Hi. I'm here to share something that makes Sharmaji Namkeen a very special film. This film is special for me not only because it's my dad's last film. But dad really believed in the story. I remember when dad got sick in the middle of the shoot He just wanted to finish this film any how. But life had other plans. There's a saying.... The Show must go on. We all have heard this, but I have seen dad live this life. When he left us, for a while we all thought.... that this film will never be completed. We thought of taking VFX route or... I wear the prosthetics and finish this role myself. but nothing was working out. It was a tough time for all of us and that's when Mr. Paresh Rawal stepped In... And helped us finish the film. It was very generous of him to take up this challenge Because palying one character by two different actors... It's very rare in the film world. Thanks to Paresh Rawal we were able to finish dad's last film. And able to release this film for the audience. It will always be one of my most fondest memories of my father. Up there on screen, bringing a smile to his count less fans Hope everyone enjoys the same way as we did while making it. So presenting to all of you. Rishi Kapoor, your beloved 'Chintuji' In an as... 'SHARMAJI NAMKEEN' Please enjoy the film. Hello... Mic check... A lot of people think that ‘VRS’ means the company is letting you go. But... this is absolutely untrue. This office is like your family. And VRS... your mother. A round of applause! Look... MD sir has arrived. Please welcome MD sir with a big round of applause. Please come, sir. Now I request Mr. Kultar Mr. Bakshi and Sharma. To come forward... And accept their retirement cheque and gift from Sikka sir. Applause!

And now, the weather in Delhi... Strong winds coming in from the north-east will keep the weather dry. However, in a few areas, it might rain a little bit. Considering the strange weather... Seniors above the age of 60 are advised to stay at home and relax. The Health Minister himself, has requested them ... to relax. Relax... Relax... You want to sit on my lap? 4 Months and 13 Days Later... Dad... Huh? What’re you doing? One minute, one minute... Man, get him a job or something. It’s not even 7am yet. Attention... Water Tank is full. - Please switch off the motor. - Full! See? Your water alarm is now fixed As soon as your tank gets full, the alarm will go off. Zero wastage! Uncle, tank is mine, water is mine... right? You forgot what happened in Mussoorie? All the taps had dried up. Don’t you read Whatsapp? Water is life. Life! I suggest... Let go, man! I suggest you take a vacation from Whatsapp and go check out the Taj Mahal instead. All these alarms of yours will stop on their own. Yeah go, go... - An idle mind is the devil’s workshop. - Dad? Done? Please come down now. Wow! The water motor, colony gate, parking... Everyday you find a new headache. There’s Kejriwal, and then there’s you. That Parminder is crazy. Dad, that’s why I’m saying, let’s shift to Gurgaon. No water tank, no Parminder. It’s a top class building. I built this house with so much effort. Should I give it to charity? Dad, it was built a long time ago.. At least come and see the place. Three bedrooms. Modular kitchen. There’s a swimming pool as well. Change will be good? Why don't you go to work in a T-shirt today? Change will be good for you. - Dad, what is he doing? - Hey hey... Eat your breakfast peacefully, come on. Hey Rinku... I made your favourite dish today. I want to see your lunchbox empty when you're back. Empty! Oh great, look at this... I can send 10 messages in one go. Do you have this feature? - No. And my phone is old? Huh... Very nice. Do you have it? Uncle, pass the billet please. If this comes here again, I’ll whoop your ass with the bat. Brother, good morning. Yeah, hello. O' lord... Throw a ‘good morning’ this way as well once in a while. How many times have I told you... bring the clothes before 9am, not after. Hey Rinku... Today is Ashu’s birthday. You remember, right? Keep your lunch light. Look at this, brother... the whole office was there. What a grand event Mr. Sikka had organized. Very good, isn’t it? - The whole office... - Hey, Hey - Hey hey... - Sneha! The phone will break... Sorry uncle. Sit quietly. Brij... how many days has it been since you retired? Four months and thirteen days, to be exact. Right... but you had two years left, didn’t you? Uncle, forget all this... What about that Zumba class? Nikki said you have joined. It’s all rubbish, it’s nothing. Oh no no uncle, Pinki ma’am was talking about you. She said you’ve become an inspiration for everyone Chicken! Chicken? Give him some chicken. What a luxurious life, uncle. Everyday is a sunday. We have the same grind... Just go and sit in the shop everyday. You bought an SUV while sitting there. Yeah, jinx it... Hey, listen to me... Why don't you come to the shop if you get bored. It's your shop as well. You'll like it there Yes, I’ll have to do something... I’ve had my taste of retirement. It’s enough now. Uncle... Hey man... I have an idea. Get some garlic naan You got the plain one. Oh hello... And sprinkle some cumin on the rice. I’m talking here, can’t you see? Hey man... I shouldn’t eat? Plain naan?... Is it my birthday or yours? Uncle, here’s the thing... I have a great idea... if you’re interested. No man, forget it. He’s not interested. Wait man, shut it, one minute... I’m interested. Go on... You should get into the property business. My friend’s got a shop on the east side. I can fix up a meeting in a second. Brokers boom throughout the year. Yeah, we also saw a big boom, didn’t we? Every corner of the city got sold, only we didn't get anything It's alright. Again with that? Hey! Siddharth! My blood pressure will rise. Can’t you handle him? Son, stop it! Listen to me... How much would one earn? 40-50 grand at least! 40-50? Uncle there’s nothing to it. Sit in an air-conditioned office all day. Show couple of properties to people. Close the deal. Pocket the commission. Alright then! I’ll come on monday first half. Monday first half. Come, come... I'll order some snacks for you. I've made some beans, it’s in the car. Take it with you. Brother... you didn’t have to. Siddharth! What is it! What...? What? What? What is this Zumba class? Nothing, man... Nikki said if I’m getting bored at home, then drop by. So I went there, what else. Very good. Do Zumba... Run a shop... Become a property dealer. Property dealer my ass! I’ll shove Ashu’s counselling up his... Alright, alright... cool it. Just drive. Dad, you never get it... Those guys were making fun of you, and you were laughing away. Making fun of me? You think I couldn’t tell? Ashu’s a kid. I was just humouring him. Right, Vincy? Yeah, yeah Dad... This is how they scammed us and took over the entire Rohini property. Have they ever showed you a copy of the family will? Now tell him. Not this left, it’s the next left! Hey! - Are you mad? - What’re you doing? Fucking Idiot! You think you own the road? Leave it, leave it. Focus here. Why do you always... you know there’s a way from here as well. Can you guys get home and fight? I don’t want to die in a second-hand car accident. Take a cab then. You’ll give the money, right? Now will you two just shut up? Please! Silence! If you’re tired, then I’ll drive. If you want to drive, why don’t you learn first? I can drive very well, get it! Hey, so many times I’ve told you not to do this. Tell me something... Whenever you get serious, why do you start speaking in English? Attitude, man. Swag! ‘Swag’ reminds me... This morning’s hot scoop... Oh shit... What is it? ‘Birthday boy. Rinku’s first bike.’ ‘Looking awesome you handsome man.’ Man, he’s got swag for sure. Shit man, what do I do about him? Ever since he retired, he’s gone nuts. All day long Facebook-Whatsapp- Facebook-Whatsapp... Something or the other all the time. Though he cooks amazingly well. Why don’t you try living with him then? How can someone cook Taro so well? Man, he made it for me specially. I’m getting some coke. You guys want some? No. Eat, Rinku Sharma. Don’t be grumpy. It's Sandeep. You told your Dad about the house? There could be a 'castrophe' any moment, when will you act? What? What? My Hindi’s bad or what? 'Castrophe'- 'Catastrophe.’ 'Catastrophe' You south-Delhi kids... Once the house is finalised, I’ll tell him. He’s acting weird these days. Honestly, I’m worried about him. He’s too sweet. It’s like he wakes up and chugs four Red Bulls. Can’t sit still in one place. Yes, Susheel... How’ve you been? What... yeah yeah, I’m fine, absolutely fine. Just out of breath from all the stairs... Where’s the time? I just went to the bank, there was a lot of work. Then Rinku’s laptop needed fixing, so I got that done. I just got home, will eat now and then watch TV... And then evenings are for walks. The luxuries of retired life... Yes, yes... You tell me, what else? By the way, how did you like the beans? You never told me... Alright, go go... okay. Yes yes, I’m fine... okay, okay. I always had pain in my knees... I used to put hot water bottle on it. You won’t believe... ... how helpless I was. That’s when I found out about ‘Painless’. Yesterday I was sitting around feeling depressed... There was nothing to do... Thought I’d go over to the neighbour’s house and commit suicide... Today's generation... Has become very smart and practical. For them every relationship... Is like a ladder, which they climb to get ahead in life. And when that ladder becomes useless.... They just throw it away... Last scene of the film ‘Baghban’. They should make it compulsory in schools and colleges. It’s a life-lesson. How do you guys do this all day? I’m losing my mind. How much do I walk around and watch TV? It’s been six weeks and the story of the TV show is also stuck at the same point. Sharma... ...you need to throw your watch in the gutter. This is how retired life is. Slow and long. You’ll get used to it. I don’t want to, man. Is it a compulsion? Mr. Sharma... What's the issue here? The government must have put some thought in deciding the retirement age, right? Does the brain stop functioning at 58? Amitabh Bachchan is still acting, he’s 78. And do the big industrialists sit at home after 58 Nonsense. You’re right. Look, having your own business makes a difference. You know Juneja from block 37... he’s about to turn 75. Every evening, he sells soup. The prick sold so much soup that he bought a car. Car? A businessman never retires. Wow, Mr. Sharma... What’s with all the snacks? Try the dahi bhalle and the chaat paapri. Took me a full two hours to make it. Not here, not here... Come let’s sit on the table and eat. - Hey Vincy! - Yes. Where are you off to this early on a Sunday? I had some work, so... Come on, sit and eat breakfast. Shut up and eat. Dad took two hours to make this. I have dance, man... Come on, eat. You have no respect man, Dad put in all this effort... Dad, Vincy has no respect. There’s dahi bhalle, paapri chaat, bread fritters... Wow, Dad... you’ve outdone yourself. Ah, great... Listen... Should I transfer some money in your bank account? No, no... My retirement fund is still untouched. Transfer in my account. Shut up! Seriously man, I’ve to go outstation with my dance group. Please, I need it. You’re 21. Focus on your career. Right, and you’re a big shot, who goes to office on a Sunday? Anyway, I’ve been planning ahead... Hello... I’m talking to both of you. Tell me... I was thinking of opening a fast food joint. Fast food Joint? Yes, fast food Joint. We’ll serve everything - Dahi Vada, Tikkis, Paapri etc... Later we’ll expand the menu... what say? Sounds good. 11am to 2pm during the day. 6pm to 9pm in the evenings. Great! And it’s not much of an investment either. We’ll even get the food home 2-3 times a week. Sounds great And think about the profit. I’ve already spoken to Ashu about the place. Brilliant! Don’t kid around, he’ll get serious. What did I...? Hey! I’m serious, man. Dad, a man’s got his dignity... You’re going to open a snack shop at this age? Just chill at home. What’s the problem? How many times I’ve told you... take driving lessons. Start doing yoga... You used to do it before, right? Just the other day on the news, they showed... A 70-year-old Japanese couple climbed Mount Fuji. So, should I climb a mountain at this age? Dad, do something in your field then. What is this stupid snack shop, property dealer, zumba? Where do you get these ideas? Nobody else behaves this way. Chadda uncle is also retired. So is Mishra and Jain uncle. They’re all crooks. Should a man become a piece of furniture when he retires? Dad, what are you worried about? Do we have money problems? Am I not making enough? Everything can't be about you. How much you earn, how much you give... There are other people also in this house. What about their feelings and problems? Dad that’s what I’m asking, what problems do you have? Please tell me. You won’t get it man. You won’t . Get sentimental at the drop of a hat... Who am I saying all this for? Okay, I have to leave now... We’ll talk in the evening. Sorry dad, I have to go too. Rinku is right. Sharma should find a respectable job. Where’s he going to apply? He’s not a CA or MBA... You’re very chirpy today, Mishra... Don't you have to cut vegetables today? The longest side of the triangle is called hyponetuse. Uncle, hypotenuse. You want to learn English or Math? Kukreja uncle from Patparganj have a big agency. Why don’t you meet them? Who’s going to travel that far? Hello... Is Mr. Kukreja there or not? How long will you make me hold? The Great Dane. Or this... a cute Beagle. The Britishers went back. But left their dogs behind. There’s good money in it. And it’s a prestigious line of work, dog walking. Don’t dismiss it. Listen... - Hey Vincy, man! - I’ll return it! Bye, dad. Bye. Man, don’t get so depressed. We’ll figure out something. Here, have another... Yes, yes, let’s begin. Or if she leaves again, who knows when she might come back. [Priest chanting] What did she say? She meant to say... Dad... dad... Yes. Huh... you’re back? Yeah, why don’t you sleep inside comfortably? I’ll heat up your dinner. No no, dad... I’ve eaten. You’ve eaten? You could have messaged. I have to tell you something. It’s a good news. What? I told you there’s a been talk of my promotion for the past 6-7 months? Yes. I got the letter from the head office today. Attaboy... Sandeep Sharma, Operations Manager. God bless you, son, this is great news. Wait a minute, I’ll get some sweets. Here, son... Excellent! Very good, son. - May you succed more in life. - Thanks. I’m very happy. I’m thinking of getting the house painted before Diwali. Dad, I need to talk to you about the house as well. What? Remember I said we should look at a bigger house... So I saw a place in Gurgaon... Again with that? What’s your problem with this house? Dad... Look at this place. It’s an old construction... And going forward we’ll need more space, right? Why? You getting married? Huh? No dad, I mean... I have a... a friend... a colleague. Urmi... Yeah I’ve seen her pictures on FB. Have you finalized it? No dad, I mean... not without you. Just... Son, if you want to go, you can go. I’m staying here. Your mother breathed her last in this house... And so will I. Have you told Dad... ...that you’ve already paid the token for the apartment? What do I tell him, man? He gets emotional at the drop of a hat. He brought up mom today. Dad’s not going anywhere, man... You know, right... His whole life is here. So tell me, what should I do? Bring Urmi here? In this house? Stop being childish. It’s the story of every household, Sharma. Kids today look out for themselves... And you’re no Mother Teresa, not like you’re easy to live with. If you have so many problems, then why do you keep meeting me? Did I call you? Go to the park and relax. Play cards with those crooks. Alright, don’t get pissed. Listen... There’s a good news. No. Atleast hear me out... You know Sweety, right... My niece. They’re having a spiritual gathering at her friend’s place, on the 15th. They need a solid cook. Pure home-cooked food. So? Our problem is solved! Chadda, have you gone nuts? Do I look like a cook to you? You cooked for 10-15 people last year at a festival, didn’t you? It’s the same thing. And it's not a random job... it’s a special gig! That’s why they’re calling you. Get lost! Listen... Anyway... I’ve already said yes. You’ve said yes? Yes! Okay, why don't you go then? Sharma, listen to me... - Forget it, man... - I won’t repeat myself... Sharma! Go die then... Don't come to me later with your complaints. ‘Everything sucks, my kids don’t care, I am very lonely ...’ I... I... You know what, you deserve this! Hey, Chadda! Listen up man, let’s take the train together. Train? - I wouldn’t ride a bicycle with you. - Don't get pissed... Let's sit and talk. Dad... He's giving only 100 bucks as a promotion treat. Here, take 10 more and enjoy... You cheap asshole, I curse you. You swine... I'll show you what curse means. Stop it or I'll hit you. - What’s going on here? - Nice shoes... Take it! You going somewhere? No... why? You don’t get dressed and make breakfast every day, that’s why. Oh... sorry. Forgot to take permission. I’ll ask before getting ready next time. I’m very late. I have to leave for office. Keys... What? What do you keep watching? They’re always jumping around like monkeys. There’s no use of watching these dance videos. Why’re you after my life now? Just look at the time, it’s almost 9 am. Go to college, study, do something in life... Oh my... Dad... What? I’m going... So should I play the bugle? Go! What's wrong with him...? Yeah, Chadda... Sharma... all set? Yeah yeah, both of them have left. There’s still some time for me to leave... Listen, Chadda... Everything will be fine, right? We’re not going to get in a soup, right? Everything will be fine, man. It’s the Lord’s work, go for it! And have some sugar for good luck. All the best. - You have the address, right? - Yes, yes... Hey, watch it... Lisa! He’s already bitten two people since yesterday, so stay back! Is Mrs. Gulati there? Who are you ? I’m the cook. Cook? Who is it, Vishnu? - Don’t know, ma’am, some cook... - Who is it? Duffer! Yes... what’s the problem? Actually... We spoke on Tuesday... on the phone... I’m Mr. Chadda’s friend, B.G. Sharma... Cook. Right right , I spoke to Mr. Chadda, yes yes... So... who’s going to cook? Me. Then who spoke to me on the phone? That was also me. That's my card... Okay...come. I thought you were an income tax officer. My husband would have had a heart attack. This is what cooks look like these days? Come, come... Come? Please come in. Vishnu, give some biscuits to the dog... He barks a lot... Please come, the kitchen is here. So... the menu is the same as we decided? Cutlets, Puri, black chickpeas, and carrot pie, right? - You'll be able to manage, right? - Yes, yes. Come, come... The kitchen’s here. Madam, is this your kitchen? Yes... Sometimes even the neighbours come and take pictures. You’ll find everything you need in our kitchen. Vishnu will show you everything. Just one thing... The whole group will be here at 2 o’ clock. It’ll be ready by then, right? Yes yes... I’ll whip up a storm. God is great. Listen... You’re okay with onion and garlic in the food, right...? Of course... there’s no fun without that. Great. God is great. Uncle, what are you doing here? Let's go. Once you’re done kneading, get it fixed. What’re you staring at me for? Go get it done... I know her favourite colour is carrot-red, something like that... There’s a maroon saree. She’s fair, isn’t she? Look... He’s a home chef. Someone recommended, thought I’d try it. I’ve never seen you around before. Have you been cooking for long? Yes, yes... Mixier, blender... you found everything, right? Should I call Vishnu to help you? Vishnu! No no... it’s all good. Coming along. Come on, stop bothering him. Let him work. Don’t disturb him. Did I say anything wrong? Ma’am... Yes? They’re calling you downstairs. Where are you roaming about? Go and help him a little. He sent me to get the pan fixed. How else should I help him? Now come along, you chatterbox... Vishnu, my lord, please come... Please wash the pan and give it to me. Come! Can I take it now? Wait, let me put these leaves on. Are you making Taj Mahal? Wait... Sir, everyone is waiting back there. Done. Now take it. Hey, wait... hey! Where’s the bathroom? What’re you doing, you idiot? I hope I haven't screwed up. Spiritual gathering! Chadda, you slimy bastard... You asshole, Chadda... where did you send me? You said it was a spiritual gathering. I know you’d call to break my balls about it... Grand dad...? Bells, son... I said ‘bells’. But even I found out at the last minute. Turns out Sweety is a sleeping partner in the kitty group . She thought it was a Spiritual gathering. It was a Sunny Leone performance, asshole. Rinku had warned me several times not to get involved in your schemes. My friend, Sunny is also one of us, isn’t she? Food is food. It has no religion. And feeding people is the Lord’s work. And anyway, you were surrounded by babes... Buddy, I'll screw your happiness if I see you again. Motherf... how many times do I tell you, don’t call... Mr. Sharma! Hello? Hello? Yes? I've been trying to reach you for a long time. You simply disappeared, didn’t even take the money... - What’s up, uncle? - Everyone was so worried about you. Yes... Is there a problem? Problem... A big problem happened. What? Your food created a riot over here. Everyone must have eaten at least two plates each. The black chickpeas... wow! We’ll have to do gymming for a week, and then some pilates. Not at all... You see, black chickpeas are very healthy... They feed it to the groom’s horse at weddings... ...so it doesn’t get tired. People have just given it a bad name, claiming it makes you gassy... Yes, yes, Mr. Sharma... Actually I was calling you because... Next week we have another kitty... Our friend, Aarti, she’ll give you a call, please talk to her, okay? I’m sorry, but I’m not a caterer. I have a friend, Chadda... K.K. Chadda. He asked me for a favour, so I did it. I suggest you find another caterer. Please, Mr. Sharma, don’t say that... I'll look like a liar. Please find another caterer, madam. In fact, you’ll find a better one... No, we don’t pick up dead bodies! What? Sorry, this isn’t the number for an ambulance. Uh look... What should I do if the caterer has died? Who died? Mr. Sharma... just talk to her once. You arrange it yourself. There is no caterer here. Please! He doesn’t drink too much, does he? Who was that? Some wrong number... some caterer died somewhere, so they were asking for the ambulance's number. What’s with the tie and the suit? I called in the afternoon too, you didn’t answer. Went to the NGO. Thought I’d start tutoring the kids again. And my phone was on silent. It rang. What amazing black chickpeas, Mr. Sharma... I swear, we’ll have to do workout the whole week now, Everyone must have eaten two plates each, Mr. Sharma... In brass plates... ’In this world of brass... You are baby doll of gold... Beware, Mr. Sharma... She’s bitten two people since yesterday. - Hello, uncle... - Hello, children. - Uncle, how do you do... - Hello, hello Hello, brother. Everything alright? What’s up? How are you? Where are you off to? Don’t see you around these days. Huh? And what about that job? You had interviews lined up, right? - What happened? - Yes... I got a call from a couple of places. Let’s see what happens. - You did? - Yes. That’s great. Listen to me, brother... Why don’t you take a trip to Kainchi Dham for a few days? Yes... It’s supposed to be a very spiritual place. You know that Facebook guy, what’s his name... Mark Zuber! Mark Zuber... He too went there. Yes. Things might take time, but they’ll happen for sure. Okay, I’ll take your leave. Uncle... Let me drop you somewhere? No, I am just going closeby. - There’s a lot of space, come in. - Yes go, go... It's just down the street... Come come... I’ll drop you. You please leave, you’ll get late. Alright then... Okay then... Buddy, gold prices are soaring. It's the right time to buy it. Even I'm thinking to buy some. Yes. Hey Sharma! What? Don’t get angry. Listen to me. No, I don’t want to. Man, I was only helping you out, wasn’t I? Now, don’t you ruin my day... I have to buy vegetables, pay the bills, pick up the laundry... I don’t have time for your bullshit. Yeah, you just keep buying vegetables and paying bills. Hey kiddo... Yeah uncle? Give me a medium-sized watermelon. Keep slaving around like an idiot. I had set him up nicely... Ran away like a thief. You’re a first rate pussy. What? You should have atleast thought about my status. People respect me here. Here you go, uncle. No, cut it and show me, it should be red. Okay... You listen up... If anyone’s status is at stake, it’s mine. What if Rinku finds out that I'm going around catering at parties? To hell with your status. You think you’re the Duke of England? The Lord has given you an opportunity and you’re whining about your son. Uncle, look at this... blood red! Okay, stick it back in. You’re incredible... A great opportunity has come knocking and you're saying you don't want it. Tell me... what’s your problem? They’re calling you back, everyone loved your food... Just go! That’s all fine Chadda, but... Stick your 'Buts' up your ass. Don’t worry about a thing, champ. You’re a star. A working class hero. Take the Lord’s name, and march ahead.. Hello, hello... this is B.G. Sharma speaking. You mentioned you wanted a cook, so... Yes, yes... Ohh... Mrs. Gulati told you about me. I don't need a helper. Knives, ladles and spices I will bring myself. Don’t worry, madam... I’m more nervous than you. Don’t worry, I’m absolutely ready. Just tell me the menu once again please. Enough! No more fighting! Like I said, corners are still open. I don’t believe you. First show me... Why should I? Pay attention to the numbers next time... No no, I don’t want to play. We’re always late because of you. Why don’t you all gang up against me? Enough! Let’s continue the game... Say the number... Beautiful legs - 11. Just say my name, darling. Women go flirty at 3 - 0 - 30. Aarti... We’ll have to keep an eye on her. Lucky chor - 7 and 4 - seventy four. Yay! I’m done. This whole thing is rigged. I don’t want to play, you guys carry on.. Witch, you’re on a winning streak. What did you eat for breakfast? Just my style... - By god... - You won’t get it, fatty. Gone, gone... corner’s gone to Veena! The driver didn’t show up and I had to drop my mom-in-law to the temple. You guys started without me? Why’ve you dressed up like a cheetah? Today is 'aqua' theme, Rupali. You'll have to pay a penalty for this. I swear to god, I didn’t get any message. Liar! Check my Whatsapp if you like. Why’re you revealing your Whatsapp? It’s a real gold mine. Did you show them the Swedish plumber video? Swedish what? Sweet dish, aunty. I found a new recipe, I’ll tell you about it. Madam’s asking about food. It’ll take time. How much time? Why? Will the auspicious moment pass? So Mr. Sharma... What are you feeding us today? It will be ready in half an hour. The thing is... We couldn’t even compliment you properly that day. You just left. Actually... Since when have you been cooking? I just started... four days back. No I mean, I’ve been cooking for a long time. I cook all the meals at home. I see... Yes. You must have heard of Madhuban Home Appliances? We had a monopoly in juicer-mixers. I used to be an assistant manager there. Now I’m retired... and look... Now I’m making this dish. It smells good... I don’t know how to cook. You seem quite stressed all the time... - It’s a simple dish. - Show me... Be careful, it’s very hot. It’s not bad... Maybe a little too much salt. Even I know that. Veena... Karaoke’s about to start, what’re you doing here? You know what Rupali just said... That Pakistan’s prime minister is Dawood Ibrahim. Come. No, sorry sorry... It's Javed Miandad. - What rubbish... - She’s a genius. Okay listen... you put in potatoes for that, right? Boiled or raw? Boil the raw potatoes in the broth, They'll soak all the salt quickly. Or tell him to put tamarind, it reduces the salt in a jiffy. Yeah... How many potatoes would be enough? Will one kilo be fine? Kilo? How many people are you making it for? Hello...? You there? I don’t know what he keeps doing these days. One kilo potatoes? You keep going... My stomach is going to be upset, hundred percent. Here, taste this... Look girls, you have to admit... We are kingmakers. No doubt, no doubt. We spotted the artist in the man. Mr. Sharma, too good! Why don’t you just eat yourself to death? It’s lovely... Aarti... Pass me lentils as well... Prema! You have to cook at my next party. I’m booking you right now. Your sauce was a blast, Mr. Sharma... Look... I’ve got goosebumps. What did you put in this? The usual stuff... black pepper, chilli powder, salt, cumin, ginger, fennel, tamarind... ... crushed coriander, raisins, cashews, asafoetida and red chilli. And yes, most importantly... jaggery. Don’t forget the jaggery. I’ll Whatsapp it to you if you want. Wow... Just a minute, uncle... What happened? Thank you uncle, you came on such a short notice. And cooked such a delicious meal. This is your payment. Oh no, no... Sorry uncle... ...we don’t have a big budget. But there’ll be a bonus on new year and Diwali, plus tips. Look, child... I’m a cook, not a waiter. You guys liked the food, that’s enough for me. Forgive me but... ...you’re like my father. Please take it... Hundred percent cotton. Aarti gives very good gifts. All done? Hey Aarti... what was he saying? Nothing, he was just saying it’s his hobby. He's not in it for money. He even refused to take a tip. - Really? - Really. Poor guy, looks like he’s from a good family. God really tests you in different ways. Really. I’m sure the kids must have kicked him out of the house. You let it be... You know nothing! They always tell the same story. Didn’t you watch Crime Patrol the other day... A prim and proper insurance agent... ...scammed everyone! What? Tell me... can you really trust anyone? My husband brought home a dog the next day. Let’s ask for his ID card next time. Yeah, sounds good... Have you guys gone nuts? I’ve found a nice cook after so long, don't want him to run away. Wow, Mr. Sharma... Your Black lentils turned out perfect. What did you do? I just waved my wand... it’s a secret. Alright fine, don’t tell me your secret. Which way are you going? Towards Subhash Nagar. Subhash Nagar? That falls on my route. Come, I’ll drop you. No that’s alright, I’ll take a cab. Come on, you won’t find cabs here. Normally, I get my own car. But this odd-even business has got me totally confused. Get inside, I’ll drop you. Alright... These clothes... Oh I’m so sorry... It's just stuff from my boutique... I had forgotten about it. Keep it behind. All the ladies have become your fan, Mr. Sharma... Yes, it's not a big deal. So how did you go from home appliances to home science? When did you leave your job? I didn’t leave my job... I was forced to take voluntary retirement. Really? Yes. So, you miss your office? I had no life outside of the office. Mr. Sikka used to call me the ‘shining jewel’. I held a company record... Maximum attendance in a calendar year. I see... So how did you get into cooking? You see, my job had me traveling a lot. Eating at roadside joints would give me acidity. Burps, indigestion, diarrhoea... So then I thought, enough is enough... I’ll cook for myself from now on. Even my kids love my cooking. Whatever it is... you have a special gift. Cooking is an art. You touch the person’s soul with your food. Thank you. I can’t even cook to save my life. My husband used to say... We have the best cooks... Why do you need to step into the kitchen? - Wow... - Then I never learned. What does your husband do? Did... He passed away in an accident three years ago. Oh... I’m sorry. How? He was returning from a medical conference. Him and his colleague. Both died on the spot. It’s okay... It's been long. I run a small boutique now. And in my free time... long live kitty parties. Being busy is the key. Isn’t it, Mr. Sharma? What happened? I ruined your mood? No no, it’s just that... The topic got very sensitive, right... You’ve got a lot of strength. So do you. - At this age, you’re doing so much... - Age? At my age? Pain in the knee, 4 and 3, 43. I’m only 43. Good joke, good joke. See I lightened the mood, didn’t I. You’re even younger than me. Looks like a fight is happening It’s a daily affair. - Are you buying vegetables or gold? - See their problem is... Look over here... oh shit! Let’s go, let’s go... What’s wrong? Let’s go, start the car. - Hey, move it! - Are you okay? I’m fine, just drive the car. But how? Come on, you too, go on woman. Oye hurry up! Are you okay? Yes, yes, absolutely fine. The draft from your air-conditioner was coming right at me so... I covered myself, was feeling cold. You can stop the car up ahead, my house is close by. Stop, stop the car... stop, stop! Yes, right here, right here. Here? But... Say ‘bye’ at least. Yes yes, bye bye... He's always in a hurry. Sharma, what’re you smiling at? Let us have a look too. I’m a golden baby doll... I’m a golden baby doll. Dad! Dad! Rinku! Hey, wait wait! It’s mine! It’s yours only, what did I... Yes... Yes Mrs. Gulati, what happened? You've to cook chinese at the next party... Chinese? - Sure, it will be done. - Really? No problem at all. Half of China is already here anyway. I’ll whip up a storm, don’t you worry. Yes... Chinese, Chinese, Chinese... Mix the carrots and cauliflower. It’s like a marriage of ingredients. Let them hug and kiss each other. This is how we prepare the Manchurian spice. Now we will dunk these Manchurian balls in the mix. But not so much that it becomes a broth. Now taste it and add a little vinegar. Those who like it very sour can add a little more. Chinese food is a bit spicy, isn’t it? Have a taste and tell me how it is. Tan-tan-a-tan ‘Made in China’. Cauliflower Manchurian. Come on. Sir...I’ve already submitted copies of my IT returns thrice. I’ve got other stuff to do. I was supposed to get the possession of the house last month. Mr. Sharma, I’m amazed, you have no trust in us. I’m here for you. Don’t worry. It’s a government thing man, paperwork takes time. But that’ll get sorted. You don’t have to worry. Sir, please understand. I’m about to get married. And we can’t proceed with it until we get the flat. Mr. Sharma... you get married without any worries. You’ll get the keys to your flat before the reception dinner. Consider this as Building Dreams’ promise and our wedding gift to you. Mr. Jain, honestly speaking, I’m regretting doing business with you. I want possession by the end of the month. Period. We’ll exchange pleasantries later. Thank you So what do you think? Come on, eat, eat. Hot and spicy, straight out of the pan. Fresh! Eat. Dad? Rinku? You eat. I've lot of work, sir. Wait, I’ll pack the rest for your family. Happy birthday. Birthday? Sir, lot of work to do, I’ll leave. Okay... bye-bye. Rinku, you’re home at this hour? Everything alright? Nothing. Forgot some papers, came to get them. Okay... Wow, dad... Dropped a Chinese bomb today? I’m cooking in my own home. You got a problem with that too? You know, cooking is an art. Now move out of my way. Excellent. So Ganesh, Shanti... Bablu who works at uncle’s house... they’re all artists? Nice, very nice. Yes they are. No work is small or big. Do whatever you want, man. In fact, I think you should put a few tables and chairs and turn the house into a restaurant. Dad, get out of the kitchen once in a while. See the world, meet people. Have a little fun in life. Yeah sure, sure. Hey, what’re you doing? I didn’t even touch it yet. Let me take a look at least. How did this even happen? I fell in the bathroom. She was doing ‘couple yoga’ with her husband. Poor thing... ...he sprained his back as well. Bhatia! Mr. Robbie... welcome, welcome. Check it out, he’s here. - Welcome... - Hello, hello... Got a break from all the campaigning? Never underestimate the power of the women’s vote. We're here because of them. Absolutely... Hi. - That's enough... - It's just a small drink. Have it Veena sis... I’ve been wanting to show you my designs. Wow! Very pretty, Aarti. You’re very good at this. Thank you! I’m thinking of asking Kunal to invest in my business. Good idea. Catch him in a good mood, while his beer’s still cold. His mood is fine now. He’ll have a headache in the morning. Forget morning, take advantage of the night. Then take his word. And when he commits, you can give him the reward he deserves. Look at her... Good luck! Okay listen... I know a few good artisans. Next time you also come along with me to the market Really? Yeah! Thank you, sister! - I'll be back... - Okay Veena is so strong, isn’t she? Runs a business all on her own. She has to be strong... ...very sad story. Her husband had an affair with his colleague. They were doctors in the same clinic. She found out after the accident. Manju here knows the whole thing. Tell her, Manju! But one thing’s for sure... Robbie helped her out a lot. At this age, one needs a pillar of support. I’m serious. So I have to make you meet the person who does it so well every time. Mr. Sharma... he’s very good. You have to meet him. Sir! Where are your hands? Your made amazing momos. Very good, simply brilliant! It's Dimsum. What? Not momos. Dimsums... ...there’s a difference. Really? A momo can be a dimsum, ...but a dimsum isn’t necessarily a momo. No worries, everyone makes mistakes. Anyway, let’s forget about dimsums and momos for now. Let’s talk business. There’s a small religious function happening close by on the 17th. If you’re free... ...then please handle all the food at the event? Me? Oh no, no... Who has the time? I’m very busy. Cooking... cooking... there’s no time at all. Mr. Sharma... you have to do it. I recommended you to Robbie myself. Look at this... Look... Look at this diary, I am fully booked. It’s very difficult to make time. It’s okay... some other time then. But these momos... sorry, dimsums... are amazing. What are you so busy with? Show me your diary. Come on, show me your diary. - Let’s see what you’re so busy with... - One... one minute... just a sec... You said 17th right...? Yes. I am available on the 17th. It works. See, done? Mr. Sharma, you are the best. Only for you. Wow Mr. Sharma, what have you done? You’re hitting back to back centuries. You won’t find better momos in China as well. These are not momos, darling. Mr. Sharma, what do we do with her now? Now explain it to them. Nevermind... Please eat... What’s her name? You know, Sharma... ...there are a whole variety of pills available these days. If a man wants, he can touch the sky. Have some shame, They’re my friends. A boy and a girl can never be just friends, Sharma. Get lost... idiot! Gather around everyone, have some Kaanji. Here you go... Kaanji... it’s like organic Red Bull. - Hand him a glass as well. - Mr. Sharma... Thank you... thank you very much. We have to meet Urmi’s parents next Saturday. Yes, you’ve mentioned it three times today. Three times! Because I know you’ll forget... Sharma! Sharma! Mishra got a hernia attack! Is he dead? No no, he’s far from dead. Let’s go, let’s go before he dies! Hernia attack? Dad! Chocolate or pineapple? It’s been more than a month since Dad and I fought. It’s weird, right? You’re weird, psycho. Now there’s no problem, and even that’s a problem? Something’s not right. I’m sure he’s having an affair. Please! Seriously, his behaviour is very off these days. Excuse me... We’d like the pineapple. The second one, ma’am? Yes, that’s the one. Weird light, man? You spoke to Bhalla? What did he say about the flat? Some stupid red tape. They’re waiting for some government clearance. Please tell me if you need any help. We can ask my dad as well.. Okay? Excuse me, sir... ...should I write ‘HBD’ or the full ‘Happy birthday’? Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Look at that smile finally. He must have thought no one will remember his birthday. My kids don’t even love me. Now how do I stay sad ? I’ll cut the cake. Let's sit there... Oh wow, Rinku... 42 inches. What a stud... Showing off? Speaking of meat... the kids surprised me today. I didn’t prepare a thing. Come again next Sunday, I’ll treat you all to a new Parsi-style dish. Nikki... Nikki! Yes? - Come here quick.... - You go... - What? - Come, sit... What’s so funny, Ashu? Is he okay? Uncle... what are you doing? Hey, what’re you watching? Show me, on FB? What happened? - What are you watching? - Can you connect FB to your TV? Obviously bro... Then play it right now! It’s a smart TV. Brij... What the hell are you doing man? Four words... Hindi, hindi... Man, I’ve seen this film, it’s a great film. There’s a snake... She dances in the bylanes Ashu bro... this used to be your favourite film as a kid. ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham’. That was a very emotional film. Oh man, I remember it, I swear I remember, I’ve seen this film man... 'The Dance of the Snake’! Very good! Brilliant! Uncle, that was the best snake dance in history. You’ve put Vincy to shame in dancing. What a sight! Hey Ashu... don’t forget who guessed it. I was Dumb-C champion in school. We have a small group... a kitty. They’re all my friends... Kitties meaning? Dad what’s going on? Dad tell me, who are these people? I go to their houses and cook for them. - You cook for them? - Yes. Where do you cook for them? At their houses. They have these parties... So they need a specialist cook. So they call me. They’re very respected people. Dad, dad... You’re saying that... ...you go to these kitty party aunties’ houses and cook food. Yes. This is what you’re saying? This is your NGO? Dad, you lied to me? No Rinku, it’s not what you’re thinking... Dad, then what is it? There’s a limit! Will you listen... the thing is, it’s good work. And these women respect me a lot. Anyway, I was getting bored at home. So I went... So if you’re bored, you’ll go and start doing their dishes? Look at the mess you’ve created, Dad. Did you see how they were laughing? Now Ashu and Bittu will spread the word like fire . Think about others as well, dad. If Urmi's parents get to know that my father cooks at people’s houses... They’ll be very thrilled, won’t they? They’ll say, “Wow, what a great profession, let’s fix the wedding immediately”. I’m cooking food, not robbing their houses. You’re getting mad for no reason. I’m going... I’m going mad? Have you ever seen anyone else behave this way? The whole world gets bored, you’re not the only one. I am what I am! I don’t need permission from anyone! You will have to, dad. We live in a society. You might not care but I do. You can’t have your way all the time. Okay, that’s enough man... You shut up! Dude, there’s a limit to everything. Shut up, man! Yeah, you just keep shutting everyone up. Let him do what he wants, it’s his wish, what’s it to you? You’re right. You also start dancing at people’s weddings. Idiot! Did you tell dad, you failed the exam? I didn’t fail, I got a re-test. I’ll make it up. Make it up... And you’ve achieved so much with your stupid MBA? Go do your shitty job. One tight slap, and you’ll be on the ground. Go for it, I’m right here! Such a hero, aren’t you? Did you tell dad you’re moving out? Moving out? He’s booked a flat. He’s so busy all the time, must’ve forgotten to mention it. What is he saying? What is he saying? Yes, I've booked a flat. I’m moving out of this zoo. One doesn’t get out of the kitchen, and the other keeps jumping in front of the mirror. When were you planning to tell me this? When? Dad, I’ve told you a hundred times, let’s move out of this house. How many times do I say it? And I haven’t got the flat yet. And thanks to you guys, it doesn’t look like I will. And listen up... It’s the last day for the electricity bill. Pay it. That's enough! Rupali, weren't you suppose to eat 12 in 2 minutes, Twelve only. Shut up and let me eat. Take care... it’s so spicy, your piles will act up again. Dhingra, you have piles? Mr. Sharma, you’re killing us. What’re you doing? - Who wants almond milk? - Yes. My god, what did he put in this? Take it. Done. Have some, it’ll cut the spice. Aarti, you’re wheezing constantly. Have some... I said, I don’t want any. Why is she upset? Kunal refused to invest in her business. Oh, I see... No problem, you can take it out of my kitty. It’s not about the money. My mother-in-law doesn’t want me to start my own business. Why? Same story... Myra is growing up, she’s about to enter first grade. And Kunal wants another child as well. Nonsense! Raise kids, handle the kitchen and serve your in-laws... That’s what you keep doing your whole life. I wanted a job too. Even did a beautician course. Nobody allowed me to work at that time. And now they keep accusing me of doing kitty parties all the time. That’s how it is... And why shouldn’t we have our kitty parties? It’s our life! Exactly! Don't even do kitties now. Our husbands never take permission from us for anything. But we have to take the whole world’s permission. I swear... this country is bad for women. Absolutely right. Why take anyone’s permission? Are we children? Family has become a disease now. Do this, don’t do that... You do what you feel is right. Or you’ll be sitting around with a sullen face your whole life... And keep listening to his nonsense. Here you go... What happened? Tell me? Keeping too many secrets can cause stomach-ache. Tell me. It’s nothing... I never told my sons that I’ve been cooking for you guys. Meaning? As in, kitty parties etc... You didn’t tell them anything? Zero? Zero. Rinku found out yesterday. Then? Then nothing... ...it turned into a war. Bodies everywhere... You mean you’d been lying to them for all these months? So what? Rinku lied to me as well. Booked himself a new flat without telling me. Yes, but your lie still remains a lie, doesn't it? And... This isn’t something to hide anyway. Why should I tell them? Who gives a damn about me? Until it’s time to pay the bills, no one cares about me. No one ever calls and asks how I am? Or how my day went? They got a cake on my birthday, and their duty’s done. What’s the point of such a family? Family is still family, Mr. Sharma... I don’t want such a family. At least you’ve got someone in your life, with whom you can fight and get upset. Good, Bad, Ugly... they’re still family. Don’t distance yourself from them. Life isn’t built on lies... I know this. I’ve suffered it. Anyway, forget it... There’s a shop nearby. It has the best desserts in Delhi. Let’s go. My treat. Gupta Sweethouse? You know it? Suman used to love this place. Really? She had a big sweet tooth. She was crazy about it.. I’d keep scolding her, “Don’t eat too much, you'll get diabetes. But she wouldn’t listen. We had a fixed date every weekend at Gupta Sweethouse. We use to ride on a scooter with... Vincy in front, Suman and Rinku behind. So... what happened to her? Double typhoid. Wasn’t detected on time. Then what could've happened. I’m sorry. No, that’s alright, you didn’t even know her. Ah, here it is! My mouth started watering. Please... Cheers! Let’s drink away our sorrows. Yes... Moustache. Mr. Gupta... - ...two packets of Jalebis to go. - Okay sir. - ...two bags of Jalebis to go. - Okay sir. Let’s give madam a taste of your Jalebis. But why two packets? One for you, and one for the house. I see... Rinku also loves Jalebis. First of all, just shup up! I went to the Municipal office today. No, I don’t want any explanation. I want my token money back immediately. You can scream on the phone as much as you want. Just pray, I don't land up at your office. I’m also from Subhash Nagar. What? Nothing... shouldn’t we get going? Where? What? Urmi’s place. Oh shit... Nice... Very good house. First owner? Sorry... Yes, yes. Check out the marble. The flooring is great. It's not as cold as compared to last year. Isn't it? Yes, yes... It’s all due to climate change. Somebody sent me a whatsapp the other day... That due to pollution, everyone will leave Delhi by 2050. Everyone’s going to migrate. And the state of the property market... don’t ask. Not the right time to buy property, sir. Not the right time... right? This is great. Son, what do you do? - Aunty, B. - Com final year. I see... Mom, he’s a beautiful dancer. You should see his videos. Vincy, when’s your next competition? - Next week... - What competition... he almost flunked. Sandeep mentioned you’ve recently retired. Yes... Madhuban Home Appliances. We had a monopoly in juicers and mixers. You must’ve seen that advertisement on TV. The heartbeat of every house. In every household - Madhuban’ - Right... - Madhuban? Yes, we had a Madhuban mixie as well, didn’t we? Yes, sounds familiar... Raju would know. Hundred percent it will be from our company. Guaranteed. You won't believe, when I retired, Mr. Sikka sent home half the catalogue. Induction stove, mixer, grinder, electric kettle, etc. etc... All our best products. And you, sir? I’m a marketing man, sir. I used to handle Samsung’s northern operations. (-Don't sulk! Please smile.) Now after the retirement... I do some private consulting. I don’t have the courage to sit around at home. That’s exactly what I keep telling Rinku. A man needs to stay busy. Yes and you know what, mom... Uncle makes the most exquisite food. Amazing cutlet. - You’ll love it... - When did you eat it? Uncle... I’m the one who eats Rinku's tiffin in office. - Tell me one thing... - Actually, dad is just passionate... He keeps picking up some hobby or the other. Can’t sit still in one place. He’s a workaholic. Madam... ...dinner’s ready. So Sandeep, congratulations. Now you’re moving to Gurgaon. Your new house is quite close to the office, I believe. Yes, uncle. Any luck with that builder? Urmi mentioned you’re facing some problems. Routine paperwork, uncle. Nothing to worry. These property dealings are always tricky, Mr. Sharma. What? Yes, yes. If I can be of any help, please let me know. Yes. Pass me the chicken... They’re good people. Chicken was uncooked. What’s the tension with your flat? Nothing. So who were you fighting with, this evening? I told you, dad... It’s nothing. Urmi’s father seems to know all the details. If there’s any issue, then just say it. I know people as well. Who do you know? Drop it, man. Mr. Sikka has contacts in the municipal department. He’s just a phone call away. - If there’s any tension, then say it. - Dad... Please... let it be. Don’t get into everything. I've spoken to uncle about it. Spoken to uncle... Speak to the whole world, except your dad. I know a thing or two about life as well. You saw what happened, when you tried to be a hero? Right... so tell me, what will you do? The flat is stuck. They’re not giving me possession. I paid 1.5 million to block it. Can you get it back? You know everyone, don’t you? You’re an expert. 1.5 million? Such a huge amount... And you didn't even bother to tell me? Sorry dad, I made a mistake. Forgive me. Anyway, forget all this... You go and do your kitty parties. Keep that chappati-maker, induction stove in your attache and go do your kitties. Leave me alone, please. If Suman was here, she would have handled everything. Things wouldn’t have gotten this far. Have faith... it’ll all work out. It’s the Jain builder's plot, right? Yes. They erected a building on the forest land. We’ve been sending them notices for six months now. Sir... We've put our entire savings into this. Uncle, you’re such a senior officer... ...there must be some way. Son... You can always sue the builder. But nothing will come of it. Once the court gives a stay order... ... then it will get stuck for a long time. Take my advice... Get your token money back somehow. Understood? Bhalla’s not answering the phone. Call the builder? The builder isn’t answering either. I told you earlier, we should've taken my dad's help. He knows so many people. Now what do we do? Is it sealed for good? I don’t know, Urmi. We were getting a good apartment closeby. We should've taken dad's help. Dad, dad... Urmi, I don’t want his help. What do you expect from me... Should I beg in front of your father. Stuck on the same rut... You see me right here, calling everyone, going to the Municipal office... Earlier you didn’t want to tell your dad, now you don’t want my dad’s help... What do you want? Let me handle this. Urmi, shut up! Urmi, I’m sorry... Urmi, please, listen... Don’t create a scene, Urmi... Fuck! Wait... Take the car back... Sir, where do you want to go? - I have to meet Mr. Jain... - Sir, wait... wait here. Sir, wait... wait here. - Why? - You can’t go in. - Is Jain upstairs? - No... First you have to talk to sir, then you can go up. Don’t touch me... Get your hands off me. Hey... stop him. Stop, Stop! If there’s too much work... Then take a break for a few days Mr. Sharma. Yeah! No, it’s nothing like that. But thank you all so much... ... for tolerating me all these days. - Oh no no... - Not at all, Mr. Sharma. But I won’t be able to do any more kitty parties. What happened, Mr. Sharma? You see, my son Rinku... Right, right... He’s getting married. Right. I told you, didn’t I... - That girl, Urmi... his colleague. - Right, yes yes... With her. She’s a nice girl. I’ll be busy with that, so... So what’s the big deal... he’s like our son too. You don’t worry about a thing, we’ll handle everything. Just give us a to-do list. You’re not understanding. What do I say... - Hello... - Hello! Mr. B.G. Sharma? Yes, speaking... Sandeep Sharma’s father? Yes, that’s me. This is officer Pratap from Palam Vihar police station, sector 38. Your son has committed a felony. Get here quickly. Hello, hello...! Oh Lord, what happened now... What happened, Mr. Sharma? - I have to leave immediately. - What happened? Rinku is in some sort of trouble. He’s with the cops, I don’t know if he was in a fight or god knows what. The call was from the police station. I have to go. What happened? Now stop fighting or I’ll lock up the both of you. Sir, I left that file on your table. Where do you think you’re going? - Oh uncle... - Come here! What happened? - I got a phone call from here. - Rinku? - From whom? - Sandeep Sharma. - Who Sandeep Sharma? - Rinku Sharma. My son, Rinku. Rinku or Sandeep Sharma. Make up your mind! Rinku, his name’s Rinku. What’s his full name? - Full name is Sandeep Sharma. - Dad! Rinku Sharma! Ah here, he’s here! Uncle... Uncle, you can’t just barge in like this. What’s happened to you? - What is this red thing on your face? - Oh my god! Is that blood, son? They ruined his face. Do you have dettol on you? Nothing happened, dad, I’m fine. - Who’re they? - No no... No, you come with me to the hospital. - Oh uncle! - Yes. A chargesheet is yet to be filed against him. You can check your files later. Let's go son! Hold on, this is a police station. Take it easy! Uncle, he’s not going anywhere. He’s being charged under three different sections. Sections 143, 147 and 151. Have you left any? Why? He broke the Building Dreams office. Then? Then we broke him, what else? What? Is he a table that you broke him? What is this ‘Building Dreams’? Mr. Jain has pressed charges. He’s sitting inside with the station incharge. You and Mr. Mathur are going to get me divorced. Look at this, you’re sitting here... - ...stuffing your face with oily cutlet. - Let me in. What do you people think? Because we’re decent people, we’ll tolerate anything? Hold on, uncle, hold on! Who are these people? Sir... He is the father of the accused... - ...along with his gang. - Oh I see... Alright... Alright... everyone get out! Move. And you call him decent? He cracked a security guard's head open. He’s getting stitches at the hospital. Yeah and they were giving me flowers, weren’t they? Look at his arrogance! Just tell me one thing... If you’ve taken his money, why can’t you give him the flat? Does money grow on trees? He’s earned it with his blood and sweat. We're not businessmen like you. Go away, uncle, I don’t want to argue with you. And take this choir group of yours with you. - Who’re you calling choir group? - Have some respect! One complaint is enough... To turn ‘Building Dreams’ into ‘Crashing Dreams.’ - Do what you want. - Yes we will! File as many complaints as you want. I am not scared of it. Get lost! Hey, listen! You want a slap in the face? Should I oblige? I’m from Phagwara, not Delhi, understood? This is dacoity in broad daylight. Daylight dacoity! Mr. Sharma, call the police. Yes. Yes, call the police. The police? No one is going anywhere till we get the token money back. - You’ll have to put us all in jail with Rinku. - Yes, yes. Down with Police Hooliganism! - Listen... - Down with Police Hooliganism! Shut Up! Down with Police Hooliganism! Dad, who are these women? Where did you find them? They are my friends. I told you, didn’t I... What kind of friends are these? They are very good people. This is going straight to the Chief Minister's helpline. Breaking news... The Police and Real Estate dealers scam. Stop this video, man. Rajni! snatch the phone! Problem solved! Very nice. Great job! Rajni, you’re a sure-in for ‘cop of the year’. Just one more thing... Confiscate all these ladies’ phones and line them up in the corner. Give your phone... What is this behaviour, sir. You shut up! This is why India is in such a sad state. You must’ve taken bellyful of bribes. Cops and criminals sitting together and partying. You should feel ashamed. Is this your ‘Help us help you better?’ Is it? Dad, dad... Please calm down. Look at this... I thought the son was a hooligan. But it looks like the fucking seed is rotten. - What! - You swine... - Dad! - Stop him, leave him... It’s one all. - Excellent! - Very good. Pratap! Throw this father-son duo behind bars. Slap a section 153 on them, in bold. Assaulting police officer in police station. Now I’ll show you what ‘help us help you better’ means. Rot in jail for six months, and then you’ll find out. Happy? Satisfied? Why did you even come here? What do you mean? You’re in trouble and I won’t come? Madam... You know who Kiran Bedi is? She came to our house during the last elections. So? So nothing... you should be aware, that’s all. You don’t worry... The cop who locked us in will be saluting us while letting us out. Dad what are you doing? Where did you get this phone? Someone will see it. Please don’t create another scene here. Just sit over there quietly. My husband knows Kiran Bedi too, you know. He’s taken a selfie with her as well. Don’t you talk about creating a scene today. I’ll call Mr. Sikka. - He must be on a trip. - What’re you doing? Why isn’t Vincy here yet? I’ll call Chadda! Dad, forget your Chaddas and Sikkas. You haven’t made a single useful contact your whole life. And you have, right? Take this... Call Urmi’s dad. Call him! If you guys are done... Can I call my girlfriend? Myra has an exam tomorrow. - Sharma! Sharma... - I'll have to get her prepared... - Sharmaji... - Chadda! Oh hello, uncle-nephew... Where do you think you’re going? That’s my father, B.G. Sharma. That's Vincy. He’s my childhood friend. So what do I care No you see, we grew up together in Subhash Nagar. Well this isn’t Subhash Nagar. This is police station. One minute... I just want to speak to him. Sir, don’t you get it? I’ll lock you up inside with him. - Get away! - Go go... Or you can meet him inside. Sorry, sorry. Sit over there in silence! - Hello... I am... - Creating nuisance. I’m Sharma’s event manager. Okay.... I handle everything. - I see... - Sharma... Yes I’m fine, Chadda. What’s your name? That’s enough, uncle, pipe down! How’s your dancing coming along, son? Dance? Your dad’s told us all about you. Hey, shut it! What’s your problem? Madam, this is a police station, not your living room. Don’t you dare say another word. Now all of you better sit quietly or all are getting locked up. It’s your last warning! Call... Call, call... Wait a minute... Dumb charades... one word. Cheek... Mosquitoes... There’s a mosquito bite, right? No. Cheek. Dimple... Dimple Kapadia! Dimple Kapadia is here? Dad, why Dimple Kapadia will be here? Dimple’s movies. ‘Dil Chahta Hai’? Jai Santoshi Ma’. ‘Zakhmi Aurat’. What are you doing, man? ‘Saagar’. Hey lady! What film are you guys making? Move another muscle... And I’ll throw you inside. No one’s going to be able to get you out. Shut your trap and sit quietly! ‘Bobby’. ‘Bobby’... ‘Bobby’, ‘Bobby’... Earring... earring. No, dad, this means it sounds like Bobby. Rhymes with Bobby... Dhobi... Gobi? Shut up. Robbie...? Robbie? Yes! No. Who is Robbie? Call him! Quiet! Jai Hind, sir! Robbie! Hi! Two minutes! Robbie’s here! What’s the matter? Your voice has gone? stand up, sit down’ anymore, huh? Cat’s got her tongue. You should have called me before only. Why’re you running around here and there? Sikka’s phone was unreachable. His son-in-law is a big tax officer. Why Sikka, even Obama will show up for you. Sir... Sorry, sir! It was a misunderstanding. He never told me he knows you. I see... I’ll deal with you later. Sir? So... we can leave? Not like this, sir... we’ll drop you home. Oh really? Pratap, get the car out. One minute... How can you leave a police station without bribing them? Bribe? Give us all a taste of your ‘Kaanji’, it’ll be brilliant! - My mother used to make it exactly the same way. - Kaanji? What a guy! We tried Sanjiv Shah’s recipe at home... ...but not the same magic. The problem is with his recipe. The thing is, you have to make it and keep it out in the sun for a while. Really? I even commented on his video, but no reply. People can’t take criticism these days. - One has to scream into their ear to make them... - Dad, dad... that’s enough. No man, if he stops... then what’s there for us to do? Thank you. Today I won’t call you Robbie,... ...nor brother-in-law. Today... You are ‘The Mayor’ of this city. Come on! The line’s clear. He’s the brother-in-law. Please compliment me to your sister. She keeps taking my case at every instant. Who’s sister is she after all? You two sisters, I tell you... Alright, now come on... First time we’re in a police station, we need something to show for it. Mr. Sharma, this calls for a selfie. Let’s go, brother-in-law, come on. Thank god, this episode is over. I feel like I’m on ‘India’s Most Wanted’. Rinku, remember us at your engagement. Mr. Sharma, thanks to you, we’ve experienced a police station as well. The picture should look good. Smile, smile! Any kitty party work, just give me a call. You have my number, right? No, I don’t keep a cell phone. I see... Okay, bye everyone. Robbie, bye! Thank you! Jain is upset right now. Go and meet him on Monday. Okay sir. He’s got another building in South City. He said he’ll adjust you over there. Right, sir. Sir, thank you so much. Really means a lot. No problem at all. Bye! Bye! See you! I really have no words... You have to say thank you to thank me. Thank you! It’s late... you’ll go back on your own? Come along halfway... I’ll drop you home. Go. Your sons are waiting for you. Thank you, Veena. Thank you. I’m sorry... I had too much drink and lost control. Dad, I’m sorry. He’s apologising, sir... Forgive him. Please dad, it’s done now... please be normal again. You look ahead. Check this out... ...the builder sent options for the house. By the way, how do you know Robbie Sachdeva? He’s the mayor of west Delhi. He’s in our circle... ...an old acquaintance. Yeah but... Who shows up to help someone in their time of need these days? These politicians can’t be trusted. I had already called Mr. Sikka. Man, this is your problem. He came forward and helped us... And you’re still stuck on the same rut. Sikka, Chadda... My problem? That’s why we’re returning from the police station in the middle of the night? So you’ll keep rubbing my nose in it? Should I give you a written apology? Yes, with the date! Somebody give him a pen and paper. Yes sir... You keep your eyes on the road. One second, I’ll get out, you guys can continue. Keep sitting. You showed up two hours late anyway. Hey I changed three trains to get there. Would you have given me money for an Uber? At least earn enough to afford an Uber. I will One day.
