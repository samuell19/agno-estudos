Ropa... OK Charity? OK as for food I didn't, um... Uh... I don't know, if I have any. Cos I love food. All kinds of food, I love food, I love eating. So I don't think I have favourite... Like, "This is my favourite." But I've got this, I think... Apple, will do for me. Yeah. An apple? An apple. Sorry I ate mine. Ah it's fine. And then for, for the movies, I just, watch any movie, as long as it's not horror, or... Action, I don't like guns and... What do you call it? Zombies! I don't like those movies, they... They frighten me a lot. My favourite film is called, "The Perfect Guy." Yah, sure! Why is it your favourite? It's my fav... it's just because maybe I watched it once and I never, like, had a chance to get a copy of it. Yeah. And then I just got interested in it cos it's... It teaches about who to have trust on and... I learned that you shouldn't, er, have, er... like, divided attention, you should have to love one at the same, one at a time, then... If you have to make choices, alternative, you have to choose the best. Not the "better." Yeah. So... Who is your "Perfect Guy," how would you...? Oh! Not yet, not yet, I'm still like, I'm still young for that. But soon, when I'm 23, I will have one, then I'll know it... I will know how to choose, like... What's the plan? The plan is to meet a guy, who's hunky... Light, tall, erm... W-Who got sense of humour, who got this... Funny character, who's always happy. Wow... Yeah. That's my wish, to meet "The One," yeah. Light in complexion, more like coloured. Jesus... OK... You have a... big list there... Why is the light skin... like the light complexion important? I love light guys, because I got this thing for the skin, you know the light ones, it's... Something... just to mix the race, I think. Yeah, nothing much. Is there anything you'd change about yourself? Maybe lifestyle. Lifestyle. Yeah. Like, change... Country. Change... My diet. Even change my hair colour. Yeah. My friends... Wow, everyone is my friend. Everyone. What do you think's a waste of time? Bathing. I think it is a waste of time... spending a lot of hours in the bathroom. Yeah. I find it boring. So what makes you happy? Food. You love food... I'm, whoosh... 110 % good at maths, I love mathematics. I love my maths, I love I love maths. I love maths more than food. Yeah, I see. I've got this attitude, like, I say, I don't live for, um... "I don't live off the past, I live for the future." So it's... the past is the past. And I'm focusing on the future. Do you think it's important to reflect on the past? No. It's different cos when you're... when I was young, I would just think of... I didn't, I wasn't that much focused about... Who I want to be. Cos I would change, like, "Today, I wanna be a doctor, tomorrow I'll be a..." But for now because I'm studying accounts... That's why I'm like focused for, on the future, cos... Of the past, I didn't think of... whom like... Anything about my career and stuff, yeah. So I just think, it doesn't ever flash like for my future, so I just, just put it behind my back, and then, let go of the past. In 5 years to come? I'll be studying law. In 10 years? I will be a lawyer. In 20 years? I don't know. In 40 years? I will be dead. I don't want to grow old. I don't think old people have happiness. They are always suffering, like, some of them will be blind. I don't want to reach that stage. I don't want to give people problems. I would love to... To stand for children's rights. To make sure that... Children are being treated well. And they are... being heard. I'm loyal. Prove it. Ah, like... When someone shout at me, I don't shout back. I just keep quiet. It's good to avoid violence. Do you think sometimes you need to confront people? I don't have that courage. I just feel it's something that I don't have to do. It's not part of me. But if you're a lawyer, if you wanna be a lawyer... You're gonna have to, you know... Present arguments all the time. Being against people... That's what I'm trying to learn, but... Maybe, that would be reasonable. It happened that... One day I was on duty, I had to sweep the yard. So, I did my duty. Then Dorcas came. And she said I was not the one who was supposed to sweep the yard. I was supposed to do the dishes, so... I was supposed to go... after sweeping the yard, I was supposed to go and do the dishes again. Then I refused. I was angry, she started shouting at me. She was just talking in harsh voicing, that, "Be it you like it or not you have to do those dishes!" Yet she had done nothing since morning. "You have to do it, it's your duty..." And I was silent. And what did you do, just walk away? I went into my room... And I cried. Because of... chores? Because I couldn't answer her back. She's the one who came to me and apologized. I just said, "It's OK, it happens, that's life." So she realized she was supposed to do the dishes? Do you think... she's lazy? Yeah she is! I wanna have the courage... To answer back when someone shouts at me. - What would you say? - But I can't.... I wanna have the courage... To let them know how I feel. It's just because... I'm not confident. And just because... I'm afraid. Of what? Of people. Of people? I don't have that courage. You don't have it now but... Of course, I will, soon... Like... Right now... I'm learning how to... Like, I'll be talking to my wardrobe... Seeing it as a person. Yeah, like... I'll be imagining... Standing in front of thousands and thousands of people, talking to them. That really makes me happy. I was once dreamed about... Being a lawyer... But... The country that I was, I don't even know it. It was really a beautiful country. With many people, people there were very friendly... I just liked it. - Why was it beautiful? - There were... Tall buildings... many of the buildings were very tall. And... It seems to be... A very rich country. I would love to stay in Zimbabwe. That's the place where I grow up in, so... I also want to help children from Zimbabwe. And, the other thing, just because... Zimbabwe's still a developing country. They need a lot of help. So I think that would be a good idea... If I can be... part of those people who will be helping Zimbabwe. What do you guys want to be when you grow up? Why? Why? Like I said, I want to be a chartered accountant. So I'm doing A-C-C-A. It's "Association of Chartered Certified Accountants." It's a program based in the UK so I think that I got access to be in London, so... I just wanna be an accountant in London, so I'm dreaming to be there. London... It's a country that... we were young, we just used to, like... "Heard of it?" "There is a place called London, in UK, and it's... It's nice, beautiful, it's got everything, people there are rich and you got, whatever you want at any time," so just... Just love London, just wanna be there, one day. Nah... I wanna live in Zimbabwe. I only love Zimbabwe because that is where... Where I was born, and... There are so many Christians in Zimbabwe, more than... Any other country. So, I love... Zimbabwe most... Because it gets me to closer to God. Yeah. I try to talk to God that... He must forgive all the sinners. And... He must help... help all the sinners to repent. And believe in the gospels. Because even though, if you... Do something to a little thing, or a little animal... That is a sin. That is what I'm talking about. I think... Others didn't love God and others love, but... I think... There'll be time when... God will destroy all the sinners. I think there are so many religions... Because... That is what I think, because we are... Coming to an end... of the world. Cos, it is written in the Bible that... Erm... "During your last days there will be many," like, "prophets. Some will be true... Some will be... false prophets." So when do you think will be the end of the world? Ah, very soon when Jesus come. No one knows the time, the day... Even the year no one knows. He will just come. He will raise... those who died... Those who died as believers. Then He will take, all... All the... believers... to heaven. Then there will be... is it 100 years? Of suffering for the sinners. Where there will be... Like... You don't have to... You will not be able to buy in a shop, without... The triple 6... triple 6 mark, on your head. People will be suffering. And you'll be forced to... You'll be forced to... Worship the devil. If, uh... those who not want to do that, will be killed. Where did you get all this? Part of in the Bible, then... Uh... Part of it, there's this book... Which is written... "The Coming of Antichrist." That I once read at school. I was given it by my... I borrowed it... from my friend. Does that scare you? Yeah. Do you believe... Do you believe everything...? Like everything you've said about, you know, 666, and...? You think that all that's true or is that just...? Yeah, I did believe it. Cos... some of it... is referred to the Bible. Some of the verses are taken from the Bible, that is why I believed it. Like, in the morning I wake up, then I... I wash plates. Then I sleep, then I wake up, then I... Then I... I drink a cup of tea, then I go and sleep... Then I wake up, then I cook for lunch, then I eat, then I go to sleep. Then I wake up... Then I'll bathing... and sleep. Then I wake up, then I go do my supper. Yeah... sleep, sleep, sleep... If I wake up, then I eat, then I go to sleep, if I wake up and yeah just... But why do you sleep so much? To avoid something. To avoid, like... bad things and... I love sleeping. Do you feel like you're wasting time, sleeping? No! No... There's a guy, the black guy here, Daniel. Yeah... Daniel, not... yeah, Daniel. Daniel T____. Cos he make jokes, dry jokes, and it's... - I can... - Like what? Like... In Shona it can go like, saying things that don't mean a thing, like... Just saying things like, "You're a bed," or something. Like, "You are a tree," "You are a leaf," and it's... That's... yeah, that's crazy. And then he makes me laugh like the whole day long. OK... it was a dry one but I just loved it, like... Here you, you... Ah no I won't say it! It's crazy, I won't say it. No... It's funny in Shona not in English, you know, yeah... Just tell it in Shona, for the Shona audience... OK... It goes like... Ah it's, it's crazy, it was like... "Uri kusvava!" And it's funny. You see? It's funny. ...uri kusvava. You see! That's how it goes, like, "Uri kusvava." And then you, you-- That's the joke! What does it mean? In English, I don't know, it's... I don't know how to translate it. You will be... comparing you with flowers, like you know flowers wilt? So, you'll be saying, like, "You are wilting." Wilting, yeah... Yeah it's funny in Shona, like I said, yeah. Why's it funny in Shona and not in English, why...? It's because, it doesn't mean a thing in English. Like, you wilting, for what?! Yeah... it's, it's not funny in English, yeah. But in Shona it means a lot, people will go laugh like the whole day. Like, "Wow... what?!" - The whole day? - Yeah. You can just say it to anyone, it's like, "Oh wiseman!" You see. Mmh! When I was young... I didn't like my lips. They... made fun of my lips, saying, "They are very big. They are not of your age." So I hated that part, but later on... I just realized that... It's God's... plans, I cannot change it. That is what I am. Like, they will be touching them. And stretching them. Especially when I was at the primary, at that school. Until then Elizabeth told me... That... It's God's way. She's a loving mother. I really like her. She's always there for us. She just treats us like her own children. I really like her. Ah... we went out for a party. We came home, we come back home. The doors were locked, the gate was locked, and we were in trouble. And we had to face Elizabeth. And it was... I don't know, I cannot explain it but it was... The worst ever. Cos we had to explain where we at and... Oh! She was mad, and she was, she was like... "I will beat you up you girls, you being what- this- that...!" She was like, "Yeah... I will beat you up!" I was like, "Oh sorry! Yeah we never do it again," we beg, and then... Then she... She... she had forgiven us, then we... That's why we are here. For now... If it wasn't... for our forgiveness, we should've been thrown away. Like, "Go wherever you were at!" Yeah... Was it worth it? - For...? - The party? Yeah! What happened at the party? The, the, it's... I think it's, there's this thing for the festive... People... As for me I love... Eating... Food. So there was a lot of food, so we went by Cherutombo-- I don't fight with people, I just talk. I never been... Ah! One day I fight with Nyasha. When I was form... I think form 4. I was 16, right now! I don't... I forgotten. Then I got the cross there. I said, "I hate you because you do..." "You just hate me because I dress so nice and..." Are you friends? No! No? Yeah. Why not? She's jealous about me. I don't know why. Different, me and Nyasha? Different... I like... like, soccer. And she like, I think... I don't know what she like because I don't even care about him. Yah. Yeah, yeah! What about when visitors come here, what happens? Ha... be it you like it or not... We are supposed to socialize with them, because... They are the ones who help us here. So... We have to. So I've got... Four friends from Peterhouse. They've got a group called... it's a club. "Musha Wevana Club." They usually... come here every Monday. It's a beautiful school. They're from rich families. We are just the same, it's only that... They go to Peterhouse, and I go to Nagels. But... we are just having the same education. So we are just the same. What are some of the things you talk about together? Like... Being here... Doesn't mean the end of life. So, you have to work... Follow your dreams... Achieve in life. Then you are somebody. Musha Wevana, it's... It's everything I got, for now, like... You're gonna have to leave at some point, aren't you? Yeah... It's scary to go out there and live with... all kind of people out there, and get... your own things, get, you know, get to, to... To live your life on your own... it's scary. Yeah, Form 4 she got I think, nine A's. She... she need to read, always she'll be reading. Now I think she's 24 something... 24-26. What? Have you met her? Have you met her? Yeah. What's she like? What?! This is a place, for children... Who have nowhere to go. Some of them... OK, some of us... Have been abandoned by their real relatives. So... they are here, this place is... For us to have shelter, education... I would love to see my mum, for the first time. What do you know about her? I don't know anything, I just know that... She dumped me... that's all. When I was young, I just liked everybody cos... My thinking capacity was very low, I didn't know anything. Until, when I was told about my... Life. That was when I was in... Grade 7. Uh... I was... 14. About my life, like my history, how I came to Musha Wevana. They should tell us that because... We should grow up knowing who we are, where we came from. And so that we will know how to treat ourselves, like... I actually spent the whole week... With tears on my cheeks. I was really touched. It was something else to me... It was really hard for me to believe that... My biological mother dumped me. And she walked away. That was heavy. I've got this feeling that... That is what I feel... that boys are just the same. Like, if my father... Didn't... Deny... If my father didn't... abandon my mum, I think... I should've been with my mum right now. But because... he couldn't take his reponsibility... I would love to... keep on coming back here. Helping wherever they need help and helping whenever I can. Imagining things, just imagining... Like... Coming here in my car... Uh... Like... holding my kickers, talking to Elizabeth. Giving her money for the kids. Yeah... End up laughing alone... Nyasha? OK... Nyasha, she's, um... She's, um... She's a pretty girl. Um... I-I think she... She got this sound mind. That she's intelligent. Yeah, so... I, I just think... Maybe one day, she'll be... - Someone, and... - Thank you so much. Uh, when I say someone, it's, I think, erm... I would love to see her driving a... a, um... BMW X6. You know, those... Yeah, she's someone who got this passion for... Like... Her career or something, the schooling part and... Yeah. If she... continue to be who she is, and, not be naughty and have boyfriends, she'll be successful. Yeah. Oh my God... thank you so much you've made my day. Anytime... I've never been in front of a camera, or interview, so I've learnt that it's... It doesn't matter... even if you don't know how to... To answer the question. What it takes is for you to be... To be who you are and be true to yourself and... Just to have the confidence, and not to... To, to be shy. What effect do you think the camera has had on you and what you've said? Like I said, it's... The camera, it's just... you'll be like... You be shooting a film or something... like everyone's gonna watch it. You'll like, be like, "Yo... this one is crazy!" But... So I was just afraid of the camera, I never had to do any interview. So it just feels like... What kind of questions is he gonna ask me? What am I gonna say? How am I gonna answer them and... Is it the right thing I'm answering or what? I was just afraid, I was just scared, nervous, I think. So is there anything you wish you didn't say? No! I wish I would've said more, more than he's asking. OK... So... Not now, it's a wish! It's a wish, like I said, It's a wish. I didn't say I wanted to say more. What would you ask yourself if you were me? Why? The meaning of life? Life, I think... Life... If you are alive... Life... I think life is... I don't know how I can describe life. Yeah. I was having... A bad dream. And I was crying in my dreams... Then... I just woke up with tears. It's like... there were many people here, gathering... And there was... a funeral. And, it was a... It was Tadiwa's funeral, she was dead, in my dreams. I was so scared when I wake up. So I was so scared, then when I wake up, I went to her room... And, saw her sleeping... Just smiled, and walked away. Hi!
