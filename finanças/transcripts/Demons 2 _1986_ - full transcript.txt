DEMONS 2 THE NIGHTMARE RETURNS A tragic and mysterious prophecy had warned that demons would arrive on Earth. Some time ago, it looked likely it would come true, when people in a cinema turned into blood-thirsty monsters and brought disease and death wherever they went. Even those who did not believe the prophecy knew demons did exist. Yes, all right. I'll send her upstairs. Thanks, sir. You may go upstairs, flat 706. Seventh floor. I know where it is. - Good morning, Miss Allen. - Hello, George. - What are you doing? - You'll break it! - Let me work! - Come on! I am terrified of lifts. Are you having fun? It's not my fault if the electrics are useless. Come on, we'll get stuck! Calm down, honey. There you go! What did I say? Stop it right now! This is a quiet block. Out! Hello, darling. What are you doing? I'm giving our son some oxygen. There's a gym on the first floor. Why don't you work out there, rather than spend all your time here, alone? Good, keep going. Don't get slack, Greta! Push with those legs! Is there nothing else to drink? - Ask Sally. - Where is she? You look gorgeous, Sally. I don't. My hair looks terrible. And can't you see, this dress is really horrendous. Look at me! I'm wearing a bin bag! Are you blind or what? It looks like I have no shoulders. I knew it! - What do I do now? - We're here for you, not the dress. Wait, let me try this one on. Is this better? No, of course not! It's so ugly! a horrible death. A wall surrounded the city. Only reckless people would dare violate that. - Are you not cold? - I'll make you warm. Don't panic, Carol. You're just excited, that's all. Do you mind if we leave the TV on while we do it? Not at all. However you like. cemeteries will be their cathedrals and cities will be your graves. That's what the prophecy said. And it came true. They brought blood, terror and death wherever they went. In the end, man managed to overcome the evil forces and those moments of blinding terror fell into the past, even though the place that witnessed that massacre was still shrouded in a mysterious and sinister air. - Ingrid? Eat something. - I'm not hungry, Mummy. Can we change the channel? You can't possibly like this rubbish. No, please, don't change it. Come on, let's go. - Be careful. It's slippery. - Stop moaning. - Wait for me! - Be very careful. Come on, come on. - Now, come on. - Wait! Faster! They check every two hours. Faster! This stuff is heavy. We're almost there. Hey, look. The wall. What happened to those trapped on the other side? The demons took them. And they became demons themselves. Nobody survived. Come on, guys. Glory awaits behind this wall. Hold this. Pass me the rope. Move aside! Come on, climb up. Help her out! You come up last. Hello? No, Daddy isn't home right now. Mummy is out too. I'm on my own. Bye. - Is this the prohibited area? - Yes. - I don't feel like it. - Let's go back. What are you so scared of? Let's go. - Stay close to me. - Yes. It's pointless. I'll never be ready for the test tomorrow. Come on, stop it! No way. Tell me the Lorentz formula on molecular cohesion influenced by the moment of gravity. X to the 1 = X-VT... bracket gamma... T to the 1 = T - (vx/02) where gamma equals one fraction square root of 1 - V to the second. Was that correct? See? You know it. I'll have forgotten it all by tomorrow. I already passed physics, with flying colours. Had you been working for ten hours beforehand? No, but I was three months pregnant. You're right. I'm sorry. Tell me the law of mass variation. What did I tell you? It's so much fun! What a mess. It looks as if they crushed everything. - What were those pipes for? - I don't know. And this green mud? It's probably what's left of the decontaminants. Wait! I've found something. No! Don't touch it. - What is it? - My God! - This is it. - Bob, stay still and I'll take a photo. This is a demon's nail. - Our first trophy. - Yes. - How much is it worth? - It's priceless. You know why? Because the demons spread their disease with their nails. Sally! The phone is ringing! Hello? Who is it? Speak louder, I can't hear you. Fine, we'll be waiting for you. - Who was that? - Jacob. Jacob? And you told him to come to my house? - I thought... - Are you insane? I don't want him here or I'll kick you all out! Go away! I don't want to see you here! It's always the same with her. Go down and stop him. Make up some excuse. Just don't let him come up. - What did Jacob do? - I'll explain later. Let's get out of here! Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Devil, finally! You really scared me. - Can you see anything, Bob? - No, nothing much. - What happened? - I hurt myself. Let me see. It's just a scratch. What was that? Hey! It still works! Guys! Come here! Look what I've found. - It's terrifying. - It's a demon. What did I tell you? I knew we'd find one. And so we did. Pamela, take some pictures. It's incredible! - Look at his teeth. - Hold on. Look at me. - Come a little closer. - Is that better? - Come on! - Am I all right here? A bit closer still. I'm sorry, hold on. Say, "Cheese." The flash doesn't work. - The flash doesn't work. - Sally! How weird. I don't understand. - Bob... - Let me have a look. It seems all right to me. Let's try again. No, it's stuck. Damn! Let me try. - Guys! He's alive! - He's alive! Let's run! Run, run! Blood called for blood. And what seemed to be sleeping was now awake again, and as evil as ever. Another chilling prophecy was about to come true. The wind of death will sweep the Earth and continents will drift in an ocean of blood. No, it's impossible! This can't be happening! It's not possible! No! Help me! Open the door! Help me! Open the door! What's wrong with it? Can you hear me? Let me out! What's wrong with you now? I'm such an idiot, getting scared! - Switch the lights off. - Where is Sally? Sally! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Sally Happy birthday to you Not exactly peaceful, eh? Why am I eating in the street so that Sally can have the house? Try to understand, it's her birthday after all. Let's just hope they don't trash the place. You can't stand them, can you? Do you want anything else? Aren't you hungry? - No. - I am. Listen to that commotion at Sally's. - I wonder if they've cut the cake. - Were you thinking of the cake? Your cravings again... - I'll go upstairs to ask. - No, I will. Surely you don't want to starve our son? It's me, Hannah. Open the door! - I'll go down to the bakery. - You're adorable. Get me something with lots of cream and strawberries. - How many cakes do you want? - You decide. - Thank you, darling. - My pleasure. - Call me. - Will do. Come on, more energy! - Hello. - Hi. Are you done as well? - Excuse me? - Nothing. What happened? Devil, be quiet. The light will come back on soon. What's happening? Where is he? Why are you driving so fast? Are you scared? Don't be. I've never had an accident in my life. Are you scared? Speed up, Jacob, come on! Yes, otherwise by the time we get there... they'll have finished Sally's cake! Frank? Can you hear me? I knew this would happen! Don't panic. I shouldn't have taken the lift. - Don't panic, please. - I can't breathe. What can we do now? How do we get out? - Calm down, please. - Do something! I can't calm down! It's dark everywhere. Who's there? Hello? ls anybody there? Who's that? It's me, Mr Haller. What happened to you? Something's dripping from the ceiling. - It burns. - Christ! Devil! What's up with you? Come here. We might as well stop training, guys. I don't know when the lights will be back on. - See you tomorrow. - All right. Bye. Hey, Muller! Did you hear me? You too, guys. - I'm staying. - Do as you please. Out, come on. Nothing is working. The lifts and doors are stuck. Everything works on power here. No one can get in or out! I don't know what happened! Hello? Hello? Damn! Hello? For Christ's sake! Best to turn the TV off. Otherwise, when the power comes back it'll blow. The air con is off, but we can't open the windows. This stupid block! Double glazing is bulletproof, apparently. I'm sweating already. What about you? Devil? Devil! What's that? You didn't lick that, did you? What's happening to you, Devil? Oh my God! What's happening? This is horrifying! Help me! Help! Help! Let me out! - Is anybody there? - Calm down! They can't hear us. I need air. Do something! - Please, do something! - Calm down! - Stop it now! - Do something! Help! Open the door! - Help us please! - Stop! We're down here! We're down here, please! I'm going crazy! What's happened to them? She's home alone. She's alone! Frank? Frank, answer me! Damn it! Nothing is working any more. Listen to me, baby. This is not the right time to be born. Let's try to relax, OK? What's happening? Let's get out! Run! Run! Stay back! Stay back, I said! Come on, all together! - Pick up! - We're trapped! - The phone is dead! - What shall we do now? I don't want to become like them! - We can't get out! - Yes, we can. That door leads down to the garage. They're here! Put the lights on! Try to open the garage door! It's stuck! Run inside, come on! I doubt this will be enough. - Stacey! - I'm here! Get me something to block this door! - I'll get the axe. - What should I do with it? - Read the instructions. - Should I pull this? You're all muscle and no brains! It's pointless, the door is remote-controlled. - Is it in the car? - Yes! I'll go and get it. Get something flammable! Take the car seats out! Quick! Quick! Let's try to stop them with fire! It isn't working! We'll never get out of here! Did you hear that? There's somebody out there. It's best if we don't know. Mummy! Open the door! Open the door! Something must have happened. David's not picking up. - Don't panic. - We shouldn't have left him alone. Let's get in the car, we'll be home in ten minutes. - We're in the lift! - Help! - Help! - We're in here! - We're stuck! - Hey! Help us! Come on, push it open. - Come on, stronger. - Keep going. More car seats! Be quick! We need more seats! Someone out there must be able to see that something is going on in here. - Then they'll raise the alarm. - I hope they do it soon. Please, slow down. I can't take it. I told you, relax. Put the fire out, or we'll all die! Darling, don't panic. We've left David on his own before. We shouldn't have gone out tonight. I knew it. What's so different about tonight? I don't know, but when I kissed him earlier, I saw something in his eyes. - He's probably just sleeping. - I'm worried. They're coming down the other stairs! It's us, don't shoot. Don't shoot! Come on, go somewhere safer. Follow me. Block that exit, quick! Move those cars! Push them against the door! Come on, quick! This is pointless, they can get in anyway. Shut up! Shut up! We need to get ready to use anything we can as a weapon. Chains, monkey wrenches, jacks, iron bars! Let's build some barricades and stay close. Together we can do it! Come on, move! There's no time to waste! Let's try and force that door open. Maybe we can take it off its hinges. Don't move for any reason! Stay together! Use iron bars, anything you can find. We need to get this door open. Ulla, let's try to get out of here. Ulla? What's wrong? I'm sick. I feel cold. Please, don't leave me here alone. Careful! Come out slowly. Are you hurt? I need to see David! My son! - Here, quick! - Christ! Who's there? Please let me in, it's David. My parents are out and I'm scared. Please, let me in. Help! Help! Give me one of those. Quick with those bottles. - We'll never get that door open. - For Christ's sake! We're all going to die! Calm down now! I'm scared too, but we're still alive and we need to stay alive. Mummy! She's becoming one of them. Help me, please! Stay away! Help me! Come with me. I'm so sorry. George! George! Where are you going? Wait! Don't leave me here alone! Help me up. - Hannah! - George! They're coming! Enough cars! Come away now! They're coming! Let's hide behind the cars! Be ready to defend yourselves. - Don't look. - Daddy, I'm scared. I'm here with you. Nobody will hurt you. Defend yourselves! Daddy! Daddy! - George, take me away! - Let's go up on the roof. They're coming up. Stay here. I'll come back for you. - What are you going to do? - I must stop them - or they'll catch up with us. - George, don't! Don't worry, I'm not leaving you. Hannah! I'm here! We scared her, we were hiding in here. - What's wrong? - The baby just moved. But it's different this time. The pain was stronger. We're almost on the roof. Be strong. Come on! Come here, darling. Help me out. - Are you ready? - We'll never make it, George. Sure we will. Just like we did last summer, on holiday. It's the same thing. Hold on tight. - Hannah! - I can't take it any longer! Let's go. There's a staircase there. Let's go in. There's nobody here. Of course, they all escaped. Those demons got in here too. I don't think so. The power is working. Come with me. Don't worry. They were only in our block and we got out. How can you be sure? Where are we? That's a camera. Seats... Those weird things look like parts of a set. And... the lights, the structure... It's a TV studio. They can't have been in here. Everything is in order. We're safe here. That camera is on. That one up there is filming us. Hannah... Are they getting stronger? He's about to come out, I can tell. Oh, God! It's terrible! - Please help me! - But how...? - Is it OK? - It's a boy. And he's beautiful. Look at him. He is beautiful. Cover him up, he's cold. George! She can't see. She's blind. It's over. Yes, it is. - I love you, Hannah. - I love you too.
