He looked, someone once said, like an unmade bed But nobody could be so unkind as Dylan's description of himself. listen to this* [Return Journey] above medium height, for Wales, I mean, five feet six and a half snub nose curly mouse-brown hair, one front tooth broken after playing a game called cats and dogs in the Mermaid, Mumbles speaks rather fancy, truculent, plausible a bit of a shower-off plus-fours and no breakfast, you know a bombastic adolescent provincial Bohemian with a thick knotted artist's tie made out of his sister's scarf, she never knew where it had gone and a cricket-shirt dyed bottle-green a gabbing, ambitious, mock-tough, pretentious young man and moley too not much pretension about that, was there? not quite the vision that Augustus John had of him he saw through to the innocent cherub beneath no one could say of him what he said of another there goes the ghost of a poet who was dead for years before they buried him Dylan died too soon we could have borne his ghost away one could echo Sir Philip Sidney he doth not only show the way but giveth so sweet a prospect under the way as to entice any man to enter it with a tale forsooth he cometh unto you with a tale which holdeth children from play and old men from the chimney corner he loved small towns by the sea best and Welsh small towns by the sea best of all one day he discovered Laugharne that was it in the words of one of his own characters he had been lost he said and had found a dark retreat to shelter from the bullies and the wind some people live in Laugharne because they were born in Laugharne and saw no good reason to move others migrated here for a number of curious reasons and some like myself just came one day for the day and never left got off the bus and forgot to get on again in this timeless, barmy (both spellings) town of herons cormorants, castle, churchyard, gulls, ghosts, geese, feuds, scares, scandals, mysteries, bats in the belfry, skeletons in the cupboards, pubs, mud, cockles, flatfish, curlews, rain, and human, often all too human, beings; with its seven public houses, one chapel in action, one factory, two billiard tables, one St. Bernard (without brandy), one policeman, three rivers, a visiting sea, one Rolls-Royce [selling fish and chips], and a multitude of mixed birds here we just are and there is nowhere like it anywhere at all for 15 years this was his home here he worked and talked and drank and laughed and cried from here he sometimes ventured forth, beckoned by increasing fame to London and America and back here too he always came with the noise of distant adulation fading in the wind the boy in a dream knowing that the voice was his to the lane where he paddled blind home through the weeping end of the world here in his simple shed he laboured and found not peace but turbulent acceptance it is not a little thing, he thought, this writing that lies before me It is the telling of a creation he could translate every symbol of his dreams and he lifted the pencil so that they might stand hard and clear upon the paper but sometimes the morning was against him he struggled with words like a man with a son and the son stood victoriously at high noon over the dead story the afternoon was dying lazily namelessly drifting over hill and tree and river and corn and grass to the evening shaping in the sea being blown from Wales in a wind and far away in the West across the sea he loved, he died the ugly lovely town is still alive, the war made a hideous hole in it the shop that sold gobstoppers that rainbow as you suck brandy balls, wine gums, crimson cough drops to spit blood, ice-cream cornets, dandelion and burdock, raspberry and cherry ale the school world is shattered the echoing corridors where he scribbled and smudged and yawned in the long green days waiting for the bell here was once the fleapit picture house we called the itch pit week after week for years and years we had sat on the edges of the springless seats there in the dank but snug flickering dark let's go and see Lon Chaney and Richard Talmadge and Milton Sills and Noah Beery and Richard Dix and Slim Summerville and Hoot Gibson we both sighed "Oh for our vanished youth" the caf√© in the High Street where he talked with the dead and the now dying past the havoc'd centre where once a very young man had mucked about as chirpy as a sparrow faster remembered invisible shops recalling to me my dead youth in the vanished High Street when the shop windows were blazing and singing came out of the pubs I wonder whether you remember a friend of mine he always used to come to this bar he wore a perched pork pie hat with a peacock feather who? him? he owes me half a crown there couldn't be two like him, let's hope. Down to the Three Lamps I used to see him lifting his ikkle elbow What's the Three Lamps like now? it isn't like anything it isn't there it's nothing man you remember Ben Evans's stores? it's right next door to that. Ben Evans isn't there either there the Three Lamps had stood Now the voices of 14 years ago hung silent in the ruin. The brick heaps and the broken wood that had been houses once, where the small and hardly known and never-to-be-forgotten people of the dirty town had lived and loved and died, and, always, lost. In those always radiant, rainless, lazily rowdy and sky-blue summers departed I remember August Monday I remember the sea telling lies in a shell held to my ear as we climbed to the still homes over the mumbling bay we heard the music die and the voices drift like sand oh yes I knew him well I think he was happy all the time what has become of him now? dead dead dead
