Give me a light. Light it. What's the matter with you? Move it! Go away! - Bastard! - Bro! Oh, bro! Bro! I came for you. I'm so glad you're out, bro. - Bro! -Enough! I know! I'm so happy you're out. I know. Where's the Malaysian guy? I was all alone while you were in jail. I know. I promise to avenge you, bro. I asked where's the Malaysian guy, get it? Bro. - You! - Relax! Planning to run away? - Get in! - What about the bike? Don't give me any crap. Get in! Relax! Be careful with my bike. Boss. There's this Malaysian guy... He stole it, Boss. Give us some time, we'll find him. That's your problem. I don't want any excuses. We promise to find him. Just ask this Burmese guy. That's right, Boss. Al Buqerk here knows the guy well. What are you guys doing? Boss? What's this? If you don't want to end up the same..... ...get our money back! Bro! Hello, love. How are you? Honey, I'm fine. I miss you. You speak in Malay! I miss you too. I miss you too. I'm learning. Why are you wearing a mask? I have a surprise for you. I like surprises, what's it? Tell me. Are you okay, honey? This is not you. This is not Cherry. Tell me. Who are you? No, it's me. I am Cherry. This is the surprise. I had plastic surgery. Do you still love me? Wow! You look beautiful. I still love you! Don't worry. Thank you. I like it. But Cherry, I have a surprise for you too. Really, what is it? Be patient. Are you taking off your pants? No. Here, not here. Oh my God! Is it for me? For us to be together. If you're going to propose me, first, you have to meet my family. Meet your parents? Yes, you have to come to Thailand. I will. Darn it! Hello. Pornteliwat is dead. You still want to carry on with the plan? We divide it 50-50, okay? Good. Hey! How are you? How's it going? Hey, how are you? -How's everything? -Fine. What's up? Why did you call for a meeting? Actually... ...I want to invite you for a ride. To Hatyai. Why? Is there a Bike Week? It's not necessary to have a Bike Week to go there. Then, why do you want to go there? - I'm going there to propose Cherry. - What? Cherry wants to introduce me to her family. But the problem is, I'm nervous. Aren't you the expert in these things? Are you in or not? I'm financially tight. Ask him. I really cannot. My wife will be delivering at any time. You cannot blame her. You're the culprit. Not someone else. - You? - I'm financially tight too. Why don't you ask RB? He's a holy man now. He's not wearing the racing suit anymore. He's only wearing a robe. He has changed. He's sold his bike. His previous motto, motorbike, chicks are gone. His 3M motto now is Muslim, mosque and mortality. It's okay if you guys cannot make it. What about the closest one to me? I don't think so. You're not a gentleman at all, right? - You're only meeting her family, right? - That's right. You're not going to ask for her hand, right? How can you be nervous already, right? A hero shouldn't be like this, right? - He's sulking. - It's okay if you don't want to go. But don't humiliate me in front of these guys. I'm not humiliating you. Then, why so many "rights?"? Right? You hurt my feelings. It's okay if you don't want to accompany me. This is Bidin Al-Zaifa. I'll propose her by myself. He's slighted. Bidin! Wait and see. Bro! I swear, I will avenge your death. Pornteliwat! Bidin Al Zaifa! Bro Aidil! That's Bro Aidil! Bro Aidil! Bro Aidil! When did you return, Bro Aidil? Aidid. When did you arrive? - Assalamualaikum. - Waalaikumussalam. Looks like you really miss Aidil. - What's wrong? - Phlegm. I thought it was asthma. Bro Aidil looked after me really well. If it's not for him, I would still be busking on the streets. He mentored me till I succeeded. Of course I miss him. When is he coming back? He's not coming back. He got a share in American Choppers. He told me he wants to take it easy. Riding. I have a question. How come you applied leave for a week? It's not about the application anymore. I'm just informing. After all, my share is bigger than yours now. I just want to inform you to be in the shop. How smart, it's all about shares now, huh? I was just joking. Share, huh? Hey, I can quit, if that's what you want! - Relax. - I can quit! Don't be so sad, easy. When I'm in Hatyai,... ...if I see a cute chick, I'll introduce her to you. You said, you're looking for a bride. Like that girl there. I am looking for a bride,... ...but not so much like that. I want..... What's that? If she's like this, I'll throb. Try it on me. Yes, it's throbbing! No, it isn't. You must help me. Throbbing! - I'll make my move first. - Okay. Go see a doctor. Or at least cleanse yourself. You sound like a pig. I'm so sorry, Cherry. I'm busy with customers. I really miss you. Why didn't you call? How are you? Everything okay? I'm fine, everything is okay. You? I'm fine too. Saiya, did you know? Bidin is coming to Hatyai. Really? Bring him to Phuket, alright? I miss that Mr. Big Nose too. Alright. Stay safe. Okay. Make sure you come here. I got to go now. We'll talk later. Okay, bye. Bidin Al Zaifa! Are you ready? I'm ready. It's not easy to wear you. I scrimped and saved to buy this suit. It's burning! Like a sugar cane extractor. Never mind. I feel squeamish. You better stay at home. I don't have the energy to squeeze you like sugar cane. No way. Thank God I didn't leave this behind. It's the most important item. Between life and death. How about the closest one with me? I don't think so. It's not fun riding alone. Hey! Move! I'm sorry. It's not your father's road! Just go, will you? Hi. Give me a packet of chicken glutinous rice. What do you mean? Give me a packet of chicken glutinous rice. See this. Oh, chicken rice. Give me a pack of chicken rice. What do you want to drink? I know this. - Iced tea. - Okay. Please take a seat. It's okay, I need to call my friend. Eddie! I've reached Danok! How was it riding solo? Fun? It was great! But I'm calling because of a problem. You know I'm here to propose Cherry. But I left the ring at home. - Then? - Can you bring it here to me? Please. Hold on. I think this is the guy who was after us. He's here, I got to go. Sir. What about the chicken rice? Come here! Hey! Stop! I can't see! What's going on? How are you riding? Come here! Where are you going? I have a bad feeling. Taste this, is it any good? I have a bad feeling. Why does this noodle taste different? Who is he angry with? Damn it! I'm dead meat. Darn it. Look at those muscles. Save my number. Oh, my! That's my future wife. It's throbbing. Welcome. Can I take your order? Padprik rice? Okay. Cherry? - Yes? - Are you okay? What's wrong with you? - Who's the guy? - Enough, take their order first. Is that all? Okay. He's going to get it. Just you wait. - Wipe away the sweat..... - Don't disturb me. Do you want something to drink? I'll get it for you. Or you'll get pimples, you won't be pretty anymore. Ouch. Ouch! It's okay. What happened to me, aunty? Oh, sorry. I thought I'm in Malaysia. Feeling better now, honey? You are at my place. She's my mom. Sawadee. Sawadee cha. Thank you for helping me. Wow, nice. - Is that Muay Thai? - Yes. - What is this? - What? How could you do this to me? - Why is he touching you? Tell me! - No! - Is this your boyfriend? Your husband? - No, honey! Don't touch me! He's my brother, his name is Ananda. He's my brother. It's okay if he's your brother. It's okay. I understand. Ananda is Cherry's brother. He's the man of the house... ...after his father passed on. Go and meet Ananda. Apologise to him. Sure. God willing. My mom said we must meet him... ...to seek his forgiveness and blessings. You mean we go together to meet your brother? Yes, that's correct. - To seek his forgiveness and..... - Blessings. - Blessings. - That's right. Alright, we'll go now. Where's your brother? Ananda is in Phuket. In Phuket? I'm worried about him. He's a big boy, he knows to take care of himself. You sound lovesick. It's Bidin. Bidin, are you okay? Luckily I'm quite a man but I don't want to brag. Come back quickly, I'm worried sick. I can't, I've got to go to Phuket. I've to apologise to her brother. Why don't you come here? Besides, the Phuket Bike Week is happening here. Phuket Bike Week? Where did you leave the ring? Okay. It's throbbing. Sit. My friend is calling. Yes? That's right. I can hear you now. Yes, you have to come here. Oh, my! You've got to get closer! Closer! - Honey! - Why? You are sitting too close. It's because of the phone. There's no line here. It's available when I am here. I'm just kidding. Let's ride to Phuket. Don't you have something better to do? I have to cover his work. But aren't you looking for a bride? Why not a Siamese wife? - I think... - Let's go. I think I want to marry a Siamese. Malay girls don't like me much. I don't know why they don't like me. Could be because of that. Time and tide wait for no man. Right? Let's go. - Bye, mom! - Bye, Cherry! No, I'll get diarrhoea. We have a long way to go. Stop, honey. I'm confused. I don't know which way should we take. There's no service here. See? No service. Which means we are lost. - Yes. - Don't worry. Follow me. It's not a big problem if we are lost. Because my mom always said..... My mom said, if we are lost, just follow the wind. Follow the wind? The wind blew the grass over here. - Here? - That means we have to go this way. The wind said so. - Honey, turn back! - Why? We have to make a U-turn. - Really? - Yes. - My mom said, make a U-turn. - Okay. Make a U-turn. Okay, today we follow your mom. Shall we go? Can you please keep Bidin's ring? What the hell is this? I'll be dead if I lost it. Thank God your "thing" is stuck on you... ...otherwise, you'll ask me to handle it too. What's wrong if you handled it? We found it! Stop! Stop here! Saiya Sukhaporn! Saiya! Cherry! How I missed you! You didn't tell me you're arriving today. I wanted to surprise you. Sorry. Hi! It's strange working here without you. Why don't you move here? Work with me. I miss it too. I want to move to Phuket. But there's no one with my mom there. I know. I'm just kidding. Bidin, how are you? That's a song. Okay. I'm fine, thank you. Wow, you're speaking Thai. Cherry is teaching you, huh? Where are you staying? We have no plans yet. That's good, stay at my place. - But... - No excuses, okay? Have you eaten? No. That's great. Help me to clean these up. We'll get something to eat. God willing. Okay. I think we can spend the night here. It's okay. Go up first. Where are you going? I need to find something. Let's go later. I'm hungry too. We can go out later. I'm only going for a short while. I'll be back. To find something, my foot! An item or a dish. An item or a partner. - He just can't wait. - Yapping away like my grandma. Cherry, by coming to Thailand,... ...isn't he afraid of bumping into Pornteliwat? She's asking why you are here... ...and what if you bump into Pornteliwat? Careful. What happened? Why? It's not tasty? Drink it slowly. Actually Bidin came here for a reason. He's going to ask me to marry him. Hey, what happened? Sorry, I got excited. - What's wrong with you? - I'm just excited. You're getting married. That's great! Congratulations. But before that, Bidin must meet Ananda... ...to seek his forgiveness. Because of a misunderstanding. What kind of misunderstanding? When Bidin arrived at the shop,... ...Bidin thought Ananda was my boyfriend. - Really? - Yes. He misunderstood... ...and was going to punch Ananda. I'm not kidding. But before he could punch,..... - ...he.... - God willing. - No, no. - I want to show her. - No. - It's okay, honey. Wow! Excuse me for a while, I have to answer this. Go ahead. Alright? I'll be back. Hey, handsome! Looking for someone, sweetie? Why don't you take a seat here first? That looks like my bride. It's throbbing. Sawadee khrap. You look very nice. Please hold this. Thank you. Yes, very nice. She makes me throb too. Iced coffee, please. You look very nice. I need to use the toilet. Who knows if there's another heart-throb there. I don't want to play house. No. My organs! They are intact! My kidneys. Hello! Hello! My private part. Okay, it's there. My wallet. Where are my stuff? The ring! I'm dead! That's the place. Wow, that's a lot of bikes. - Nice bikes. - I know, right? Nice bike. Sawadee. Let's go. Come! Let's go inside. Nice place, I like it. What did you say? I said, this place is very nice. I like it. That's good. Are you ready to see my brother? Let's go! Come! That's my brother. I want to go to the toilet. Wait! Let's meet and greet him first. - Can I wear my helmet? - No! Come on. Careful. Go on! Ananda, this is Bidin. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Cherry! Saiya! Come up here! Look at that, he's so buff. So firm! Come on. Slow down. Wait! Where are you going? I'm coming with you. Cherry, you are riding with me. - Sorry, honey. - Come. Thank you. Let's go. I wanted a massage, so I looked for a blind masseuse. But apparently, the blind here don't work as masseuse. Other people do that work. It's okay, here's my plan. What if we buy a new ring? A similar ring? He won't know the difference. He's not that smart. You know what's the beauty of that plan? We buy it with your money. How convenient? Wasn't it you who asked me to come here? Don't try your subtle humiliation trick on me. I know your trick. You are the one who asked me to come to Thailand with you. I was happy playing Candy Crush in the office. It's because of you that my stuff got stolen. Because of you, the ring is gone! Not because of me, but you! How could you say that? You didn't give me face at all. You are so calculative. Come on, count now. Okay, okay, I'll give it. I love you. Do you remember how the ring looks like? Of course I do. Maybe. "Maybe"? Sit with me, honey. Sit at the back. - What a nuisance. - Ananda. I don't like him. I pray the elephant tramples on him. Put it in. Point there. Not like that. Like this. Strengthen the muscle, like this. Sorry! Point somewhere else! Are you crazy? What if it goes off? Point it there! - Hi. - Hi. Are you getting married? You're looking for wedding rings? Actually, we have a special promotion... ...for couples like you. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Do I look like a gay? Cool it. Excuse us please, I need to talk to my boyfriend. - What is wrong with you now? - Cool it. Didn't you hear? There's a special package. Wedding promotion. It'll be cheaper. Why should we buy expensive stuff for Bidin's girl? Right? What is it for us? Be patient. Excuse me. Sorry, he's got PMS. Can I try that one? It's the best day ever. I'm so happy but I'm hungry now. "I'm hungry". You're hungry. -Okay, let's get something to eat. -Okay. Let's go get something to eat. - Let's get something to eat. - I'm tired, let's go home. But I've promised to eat with Bidin. Let's get something to eat. You can eat with this wimp another day. - When did I become your brother? - That's enough, Ananda. You want me to punch you again? That's enough, Ananda. Let's go home! I think we better go now. I have a bad feeling. I'm worried about Bidin. - Let's go. - What about the ring? We'll just buy it in Phuket. It's not the same anyway. Bye. Let's go, Bidin. Where to? To shower. Want to go? Let's have a shower. - What's wrong? - Our bike is there. This is not ours. - Big bike, big nose. - Let's go. Move! It's been a while since we heard from you. Don't worry, Khunna. I'm closing in on him. Forgive me, Khunna. Please show me that again. Wow, that's a long one. Okay, I understand. Shut up! I know. After Pornteliwat died,... ...you don't have the will to look for the guy. Right? That's okay. Let me give you a new reason. Come here! What did you do to my wife? Let her go! Let my wife go! Let her go! One more time. Now you have the will, right? If you don't want your wife to die like your friend... ...bring back my money in two days. Understand? - Bastard! You're dead! - Get out! Take him away! Bloody animal! You're dead! You're dead! You just don't understand. I am your brother. I don't want men like Bidin to cheat on you. How did you know he will cheat on me? I know, I am a man! Oh, because you're a man! You're just the same, always playing with women's feelings. Haven't you ever hurt a woman's heart and feelings? I know Bidin. He's not that kind of a guy. He's not like you! Just look at you! You are nearly 40, but have nothing to your name. No wife, no kids! Cherry, don't do this to me! Don't do this! Oh, my. It's heart-throbbing. Oh, God. Please slow it down. Remember, you're going to get married. You're getting... Hello Eddie, you've arrived? Yes. Let's meet up. - I'm on my way. Bye. - Okay. Sorry, I got to go. My friend from Malaysia is here. Where are you staying tonight? You can stay here. It's okay, I'll stay at the hotel with my friend. Are you sure? I've got to go. Bidin! She's calling me again. It's okay. Hey, where's the handle? Sorry. It's not moving. How much longer should I wait? Be patient? He got my wife! I don't give a damn! I'm taking him down! Good for nothing! Eddie! Din! You guys came! Thank you. Thank you. - Let's eat. - Carry on. I'm not in the mood to eat. What about the guy who was chasing after you? I don't know. We came all the way from KL... ...because we are worried about your safety. That's a different problem. I have a bigger problem now. Cherry has a brother. He's bigger than you. It seems like he doesn't approve of me. How am I going to marry her if her brother dislikes me? What about the guy chasing you? I have no idea. I have not seen him since Danok. I really don't know. Where's my ring? - You..... - The tom yam is really spicy, right? It is spicy. Even if it was sweet..... Hold him. - What's going on? - Where's my money? Where's my money? Quick! Get him! Police? Please help, there's a fight going on at my shop. Help please. Police! Run! They've run away. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. But you two need to get used to life in Phuket. This is an everyday thing. You were so awkward just now. In Phuket, we got to be tough. We'll face this everyday. Go on, finish your meal before the police arrive. What's with him? What a brag. I'll be staying with Eddie and Aidid tonight, honey. I'll be staying with Eddie and Aidid tonight, honey. Which hotel are you staying at? I'm really sorry for what Ananda did today. I love you, no matter what. I love you too. Good night. Where are we going? You'll see. Just follow me. What about the ring? Do you have to bring up the ring now, at this moment? What am I going to say if he asks? We'll think about it later. Let's relax first. Serve you right. Okay, let's go back. Hey, why are you upset? We'll go there again tomorrow. I was just learning a new skill,... ...but you had to come back. Who's here anyway? Where is he? Where are you going? Are you sure you're okay? - I'm okay. - Me? You're okay too. I want to meet her brother. I have to apologise to him. - Send him my regards. - God willing. - What's this? - Let's go. - I was just going to rest. - Come on! Now! Ananda! Ananda. Ananda. Ananda, actually..... Ananda. Ananda! Hey, this is Ananda! That's the guy! I have his picture in my room! He's a champion! - Ananda. - Where are you going? - I want to... - It's okay. Let me persuade him. Ananda! You are my idol! Ananda! What's happening here? That's Cherry's friend. I don't want to see his face! Don't bring them here anymore! Get lost, all of you! What's going on here? Are you guys okay? Aidid. Ananda! Ananda! I love you! You have to help me. Eddie, thank you so much for asking me to follow you to Thailand. I think I've found my life partner. My heart-throb! Every Thai girl is your life partner. Answer her first. I don't understand her. Sorry, what did you say just now? Wow, you speak Thai. I said, what happened just now? What's wrong with him? Actually, do you know, in England... ...once upon time, there lived a hero..... Oh, it's okay. Whatever.... Whatever you say. Bidin! This way! Bidin. Are you going out? - We want to... - Yes. Can you look after Bidin again? Sure, no problem. How is he? He's still the same. Okay, then. Have fun. It's no fun without you. Bidin, are you hungry? Come on, have some rice. Are you okay? Are you hungry? Sleepy? Bidin. Hurry up. You're too slow. Hold on! I don't understand... ...why do you have to see him again? I've seen him with Saiya all the time. -Ananda. - I've seen it many times. Saiya is my best friend. She won't do that. Enough with your accusations. Just wait here, I'll go up. I don't want to see another ugly incident, understand? Just sit here. Cherry! What are you doing? How could you cheat on me? I should have listened to my brother! You're not a good guy! Wait, what's going on? Cherry! Tuk tuk! Stop! - Go, now! - Cherry! Anywhere, go! I don't care! Hello, I've taken my revenge. It's your turn now. Okay, see you at Khunna's place. Cherry! I'm sorry, Cherry! I'm sorry. Let me explain. Drive faster! Why are you so slow? Please stop! Cherry, get off! Cherry! He's a bad guy! Get off. Faster! Why are you so slow? Cherry. Where's my money? Be careful, honey! Honey! Stop! Honey! Stop! Who are you? Help me, honey! Get him up! Stay still! Cherry, tell them you want to use the toilet... ...and then find someone to help us. Toilet. Don't try to escape. I won't. My stomach aches, I need to use the loo. I can't hold it in anymore. - Toilet! - Shut up! I'll be quick, I promise. I don't believe you. If you don't believe me, let's go together. Hurry, my stomach hurts. Go! Go! Let me go! Okay, I can't hold it anymore. Where are you going? Are you trying to escape? I'm in the loo! In here, not anywhere else! I'm not going anywhere. Shut up! Walk slowly, please. It hurts! Let's go. We haven't found the ring yet. Forget the ring. Look. Isn't that Bidin? What is he doing in there? Let's follow them. Let's go. - Get off! - Where are you taking us? - Just get off! - I don't want to go! Get off! - Where are you taking me? Let me go! - No way. Just follow. Let me go! Walk quickly! - Where are you going? - I'm going inside. You're going inside? Have you gone nuts? Can't you see the size of this place? We must have a plan. - Plan? - Yeah. Do you have any plans? You're asking me? Don't tell me you cannot think of one? Oh God! Me? But aren't you my mentor? I have a plan. Khunna, I got the guy! Where's Khunna's money? - What? - I don't have the money. I don't have the money. Saiya! Saiya? What's your name? Look, over there. Where? Hold this. There! You're so naive, so sweet. But stupid! Even when I tried to take your man,... ...you still defended me. Cherry. You should know... ...that I'm the mastermind of all this. Look there. Meet my boss. Khunna Meliwat. Khunna Meliwat? Their name sounds so inappropriate. Khunna Meliwat, Pornteliwat, Saiya Sukhaporn. Don't they have better names? Maybe they are like you. Where are you going? To the party. You cannot enter. I'm still upset. You stole him from me. Stole? You hated him. You said his nose was big and he wasn't your type. Enough. - What did you say? - Enough, Saiya! That is your personal problem. Where's my wife? Let her go. I really have found my life partner. -He's never stop. -She's the one. She's the one. Who are you? Get them! They really do love me. How come we don't get these in KL? Get them! Honey! Wait! Wait! Stop! Your country is very hot! Wait. Okay. Stop! Honey! Help me! - Hold on! - Untie me. I'm busy. Hurry! Untie me, Eddie! - Ananda. - Cherry! Help me! Saiya, quick! What are you doing? You bitch! Cherry! Where are we going? Get in! Bidin! Take this key! Save your girl. Honey! -Honey, help me! - Don't move, shut up! Honey. Where is my money? My money! Shut up and don't move! Honey! Empty! His gun is empty! He wants to fight. But I'm exhausted. I'm aching all over. In just one kick, he's out as light? Maybe he'll get up again. This is Eddie's Kick. Doesn't mean if he's a gangster, he's great. He's just a show off. Look at his shiny shirt. Like RTM dancers. Heart-throb. Follow us. We'll help you. We'll help you. Don't be afraid. We are the good guys. Please get in. - Cherry! - I'm here! Shut up! Give me my money! -Sayang. - I said, shut up! Don't worry, I'm here. Stop! Ananda! Hey, stop! Shut up! - Saiya, shoot! - I don't know how! Saiya, shoot! Ananda, help me! Get out of the way! Get out! Get out! Saiya! Get up! Saiya! Get up! Saiya! Cherry! - Ananda! - Cherry! Ananda! Get out of my way! Ananda, help me! - Cherry! - Cherry! Ananda. I'll kill her! Get back! - Get back! -Ananda! Honey! Cherry! I want my money! Ananda, help me! Al-Buqerk, your wife is with me. Let Cherry go, I will let her go. Honey! Ananda! You are my wife. Wife? You suddenly appear after disappearing for 5 years. You and your friends keeps ruining my life. I can't take it anymore. Forgive me, honey. I did all these... ...for our future. That money was for both of us. You must respect that. What future are you talking about? You were going to fend me with dirty money? Is that the future you were talking about? My love. My love. Honey! Stop! Stop! Enough! I'm sorry, honey. I misunderstood. I'm sorry. Eddie! Where's my ring? My ring! Ring? Where's my ring? I love you, Eddie. I love you too, Bidin. You don't love me? I love you, you know. Okay, enough. No need to hug me anymore. My cousin. Here, give it to your future wife. My ring? But where was it when I asked for it? We just wanted to test you. If you are serious or not. What are you waiting for? Go on. Now? This is not the right place. Then? Hi. My name is Bidin Al Zaifa, from Malaysia. I'm standing up here... ...because I want to invite... ...my super girl,... ...the super love of my heart... ...Cherry Ponti to the stage. Cherry. Cherry. Go Cherry! Go! I have a surprise for you. - Surprise? - Yes. Would you like to marry me, Cherry? Yes! It's yours! I love you. -I love you too. -Here. I love you too. It's heart-throbbing, man!
