BACK THEN USA UNDER ATTACK: THE TWIN TOWERS COLLAPSED Can I bum a smoke? Thanks. What are you looking at? Piss off. Are you deaf? Piss off! - Are you mad? - Piss off. Sit down if you want. - Thanks. - For what? - You helped me. - Because you called for help. I wish I had an older sister, like you. So that I don't get bullied every day. - Tell your parents. - I live with my grandma. Where are your mum and dad? Grandma and I don't talk about my parents. This like a taboo for us. No one will bully you anymore. I'll protect you from now on. - Are you serious? - I am. - My name's Mila. - Boryana. We can invent a secret handshake for us both. It'll be like this. - Don't think that's gonna work. - We'll get better at it. - We can be the Little and the Big One. - I prefer Bo. All right then. What's the time? I'm late. My grandma's gonna kill me What's with the backpack? We're off school. I always carry some books. Someday, I'm gonna become a great writer. What about you? I know I don't wanna become like my mother. What's wrong with her? She's a divorced old woman who does not know what she wants from life. I don't know what I want too. I want to live it to the fullest and become a motocross champion. NOW Can you please hurry up, dear. The taxi is here. I'm ready. Make sure you clean my study, please. Of course, Mr. Kane. - I'll take this. - Ok. And I'll look after the flowers, Mrs. Kane. Thank you, Boryana. See you in two weeks. Have a lovely time. - How are you, Bo? - What's up, Little One? Thought I should give you a lift, so we do use both cars. - I'm not coming tonight. - What do you mean? Something came up. - Are you all right? - Yes, everything's great, just... Cvetan is coming in Sofia and we're gonna see each other. Tell me you're not serious. Can't you see he's using you? Why do you allow him to treat you like a call girl? Are you finished? I can't stand him up. He's coming all the way from Varna. Usually you're not that stupid, so today must be special occasion. - I've had enough, I'll call you back. - Fine. Don't sweat it, it happens to everyone. It must be the alcohol. Barman, can I get another one? It's not the alcohol. - Is there another woman? - Don't be silly. - My niece is in a bad shape. - Your niece? What's the matter with her? She's got an issue with her heart. Doctors told us she needs an operation immediately. I don't have the money right now. The poor girls has no parents. - My mom and I are taking care of her. - Why didn't you tell me? - How much for the operation? - 30 grand. 30 grand? Son of a bitch. You should take a loan. Maybe pawn the apartment with your wife. I applied for a loan and chances are good, but the bankers said it'll take time. But the doctor said we cannot wait. It has to be next week... Please... Ceco. I came to Sofia, hoping I can take the money from a friend. - Sorry. - We'll think of something. What about you? Can you help me? How should I help you. I don't have that kind of money. - Ask your ex. - Out of the question. No way. No chance. All right, I'll ask him. No promises, though. Thank you! 30 grand? Have you lost your mind? - I'll give it back in a week or two. - Right. Three at the most. - Why do you need it? - I just need it. I'm not giving a dime for that Varna tosser. - Stop screwing around. - Buy some scratch cards. Stanislav, what happened between us was a mess. But it's now in the past and I don't care whose fault it was. I don't want to argue. I'm here to save a child's life. She's dying. You can show your good side. I know that deep down you have it. You can finally act like a real man. He's not giving me the money. Are you listening to me? - I'm sorry. - I see. I understand... Come on, Ceco. We'll think of something. You were my only hope. Know what? You'll have the money by Monday. - What the fuck? - No, no, no! I cannot follow you. The woods are my home. - What woods? - Sorry. I'm listening. I bought a mop - Limbus2000, It doesn't work. I want a refund. COME DOWN NOW, IT'S URGENT! Hello? Fuck you, piece of shit! Hello? I'm transferring you to another operator. - What's up, Bo? - Something happened. What happened? What's going on? Is he alive? - I think so. - You think so? - Please, don't yell. - What did you do? I took it but the house was supposed to be empty. - I'll get it back, I swear. - I can't understand a thing. I needed 30 grand. Took it from the safe of some Brits I work for. I thought they were on vacation. But their son turned out to be there. - And you decided to kidnap him? - No, he fell down. - It was an accident. - Why do you have a gun? Didn't know what to do with it. - We need to call the police. - No, he saw me. - Thought it was an accident? - The police won't believe it. - Why do you need 30 grand? - Stop interrogating me. You have a body in the trunk. You're armed. I deserve some explanation. He's alive! What am I gonna do now? - Do you have chloroform? - What? Have you gone completely mad? Put away the gun. Shouldn't have dragged you into this. - I'm off, you call the police. - Come here. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Let's go over the plan, one more time. Leave the car at the hospital. Take a bus to Belgrade. When I cross the border, I call the police. - What if he dies? - He won't. How can you be so sure? - I can't be sure. - I knew it. He's gonna die. That's enough. He's all right, he can breathe. What about food and water? - Pull up. - Fine. Come on! - The cops are onto us. - Calm down, no one's onto us. Bo! Boryana. Is the Chrysler yours? It's not mine. It's my ex's. You've parked in a handicap spot. Told you. - You did. - Your ID, please. It's in the car. It was here. I'm letting that slide because you seem cool. Thank you. You're cool as well. What's in the trunk? A pig. Bought it from the country. Open the boot right now! Turn off the engine! Slow down! Watch out for the karts! We got lucky! Are you finishing up? Thank you. For coming. - What happened to Boryana? - She may be involved in a crime. Kidnapping. - She's been kidnapped? - She kidnapped a person. Boryana? That's nonsense. She's as dumb ass hoe. Unfortunately, that's not a laughing matter, Mr... Nedelev. Are you seriously suspecting my wife? My ex wife, that is. - When did you last see her? - This morning. - Did she behave strangely? - No. She wanted money. This time, a lot. 30 grand. 30 grand? What did she need it for? Stomach aches. It must be for her fucker from Varna. Thank you, you may go. Actually. Put down everything you deem important and give it to the officer in front. "Her fucker". The kidnapped is Martin Kane. Albert Kane's son. - The businessman? - Martin arrived yesterday from London. - That's a proper welcome. - His family's flying to Bulgaria. Good. I'm happy for the family. There was another woman. We're not sure, but it must be Mila Georgieva, a friend of the suspect's. Good. That's the case report. That's for amateurs. I'm not dealing with housewives. And I'm late for the Turandot. It's for you. It's urgent. Donev, listen. You've got 24 hours to find the kidnapped boy. What are you looking at? His father is an important man. - Be very careful. - Naturally. Come on, crack on. Put them on nation-wide search. I want this crap finished tonight. - Allow me. - Let me. Let me. Fuckin' lighter! What you did was the craziest shit I've ever seen. But it was also the nicest thing someone's done for me. You literally saved my ass. I don't know if I could ever repay you. - What now? - Haven't got a clue. Do you realize what we've done? - I do realize. - Doubt it. What's with the tone? I didn't ask you to come. Did I make you run over the cop? If we didn't have a pig in the trunk, I wouldn't have had to run over anyone. I'm not gonna leave you, but I'm allowed to yell at you. Do you know where we are? I'm not sure. I have to go to Varna. Cvetan must have the money until Monday. Say again? - Please. - Everything's for that fool? For that hillbilly asshole, who's wrapped you in his finger! - Don't yell at me. - You ruined your life because of him. - I ruined my life, because of him. - That's not true. - What's the truth then? - There's something that you don't know. His niece is dying. The money's for operation. And you believed him? Of course. Who would lie about such thing? That's it! Where are you going? Mila, I'm sorry! Water! Please, water! It's water. Drink! - You okay? - Help! - Quiet! - Help! Please help! How did you manage to drag him before? Adrenaline. Haven't you read Les Mis√©rables, you're a fucking writer. Bo, come on. - What? Fucking. - Cut it out. Fucking! - It'll be great ringtone. - A great what? - A great ring tone. - That's funny. Let's lift him up. I can't. What? We have to surrender to the police. It's not too late. We get the money back. This boy's hopefully fine. We just smashed a few cars. You ran over a police officer, I stole 30 grand and kidnapped a man. We're not getting out of this. We aren't criminals. We'll get caught and it'll be much worse. - I can't surrender. - What then? I'll get the money to Varna, then leave the country. That's stupid. Where will you go then? Mexico. Like Thelma and Louise. You watch too many movies. Think clearly. I'm tired of thinking clearly. I'm always concerned with others and not with myself. I'm tired of always doing what I have to and end up screwed and miserable. I'm the one to blame. Each day I lose something part of myself. And in the end I'll disappear. From all this misery I forgot who I was. Who I've been. Screw them. I'm not going to surrender. Not this time. Mexico? Nothing's keeping me here. The only thing I'm gonna miss, is you. You're not. - I'm coming with you. - No, Little one, you're not. You did all you could. I won't drag you down with me anymore. I am coming. We just have to decide who's Thelma and who's Louise. That's self-evident. And we should take care of... - Marto. Martin. - Martin? I'd marry a Martin. No. We'll pay in cash. Do you have chloroform? I've got something even better. We're kidding. Can we have a bag, please? We're not joking. What do you mean, better? Good evening. Can we have a double room? My husband drank two beers too many. Englishmen. Can't hold their drink. - Do you have a reservation? - We don't. Only the newly-wed suite is free. We'll take it. 320 leva. And I need you ID's, please. I can't lend you a room without an ID. There's the ID's. What a dreadfully long day. I propose you go and do some shopping. - What for? - Food, clothes for us and him. Why me? Buy me sneakers. Can't walk on high heels. - Something else? - Yes. Just... Buy Marty something like that. For Marty? Thought it was Bobby. Bianki? Weren't there any normal, not Bulgarian, which will tear on the second day. I've been wearing mine for five years. And they're cool. - Who are you? - I'm Mila, and this is my friend, Bo. Hi! Put that thing away. Where am I? You were in a little accident, but we took care of you. What is the last thing you remember? It's all pretty hazy, but I remember someone singing "Highway to hell" to me. - Did you sing to him? - No, to me. Hold on. You put me in the trunk, after I fell of the... Why the fuck you dressed like Motley Crew? You just hit your head slightly. You'll be fine. I have to go... Why am I naked? Listen, man. Marto. This whole thing is a huge mistake. And I'm sorry, but for now you have to do as we say. Ok? Am I kidnapped? - Not exactly. - We're not kidnappers. Then, what are you going to do with me? We'll drive you to the first big town. Why don't you just leave me here, and beat it. Because we can't afford you calling the cops, or your parents. So we'll drop you off whenever and wherever we want? Capiche? - You are weird fucking kidnappers. - We're not kidnappers! - Than what do you want? - Nothing. As I said, it was a huge mistake. I have to do something. Keep an eye on him. - What are you going to do? - Get a car. I hope I guessed your style. - Did you undressed me? - Yeah. - And washed me? - Yes. - Mind turning around for a second? - Yeah. I have to keep an eye on you. I like Bob Scott too, by the way. Bob Scott... AC/DC... Yeah... You have a beautiful voice. You should be a singer. - But I'm a writer. - Or a writer. I'm gonna walk out of that door. And promise to not call the Police. That's not happening. What you gonna do? Shoot me? Please, stay... I wouldn't do that if I were you. It has an alarm and about a dozen security protection devices. You need a more advanced approach. Forgot my keys and I don't know what I'm gonna do. - There's a locksmith there. - I'll pass, thanks. - Where are you going? - The seaside. I can give you a lift if you want. I don't jump into lorries. I didn't mean to offend you. Just offering you transport. By the way, I'm Vasil. Vaslika. I'll go find my keys. Good luck, namesake! - Hi! - Good morning, sir! - Do you feel better today? - Yeah. I need a phone. It's urgent. It's dead. One moment, please. WANTED: BORYANA MILENOVA, MILA GEORGIEVA What's going on? Stop! Fucking trash! Fuck you, crazy bitch! Give me back my car! Yesterday, my life turned hundred and eighty degrees. I smashed a Police car, almost run over a policeman. I ran away from the crime scene. I dragged your ass twice. Once through the woods and once through the hotel room. I cleaned you up and took care of you. I'm not gonna kill you. But I'm not gonna let you screw us over with my friend. No matter how much I like you, if you don't do as I say, I'll shoot you in both legs without flinching. As you can tell by now, I'm already in deep shit. - Here you are. - Actually, that's fine. I was worried about my wife, but here she is. - How well do you know your son? - What's that got to do with anything? Where are you getting at? - You had over 100 000 in that safe. - I'm sorry. Was that a question? She only took 30. So... Why would she kidnap your son? Strange, isn't it? It might be strange, but it's a fact. Is it possible that your son took the money, and he's running away with those two women? Running away from what? - Any drugs, gambling... - For God sake! Our son is a Cambridge man. With an excellent upbringing. We always told him right from wrong no matter what. Excuse me! - We found them. In Veliko Tarnovo. - Get the chopper ready. - I don't want one of ours. - Understood. Excuse me. - Where are you going? - Not of your business. - I don't get you too. - What's there to get? Why would you kidnap me if you're just gonna release me? - Don't you wanna go? - I'd love to go. I just... Don't understand the logic. The logic is you weren't even suppose to be at your parents house. So you could rob my father undisturbed. I didn't rob anyone. I borrowed the money. And I'll give it back. I don't care about my father's money. You can do what you want with it. Then what do you care about? That's a weirdly personal question coming from someone who's just pointed a gun at my dick. It wasn't your... - You pointed a gun to his dick? - Don't give a rat's ass! Well done, Little One. It was clear you were not gonna shoot. Really? How's that? You said it yourself. You like me. Don't bet your life on that. What's the status with Gardev's autopsy? Gunshot to the head and the heart. Stab wound to his spleen. What did your husband say about the gramophone? - Threw it away. - What about the vinyl? Threw them away as well. How did you get yourself into this? - Boryana is my best friend. - That's sweet. - Although really fucking stupid. - Let's put him back in the trunk. Or we can just leave him here, in the middle of fucking nowhere. Yeah. Ok, I'll shut up. The bitch from the hotel snitched us out. Drive through the field. Give me your phone. Turn right! - What? - Turn right! Now! We found them on the intersection Ruse to Varna. Come out very slowly with your hands above your head. - Excellent fucking driving! - Excellent fucking navigation, bro! You were awesome! That was the wildest thing I've done in my life. My heart's still pounding. Unknown. - Who is it? - I don't know. Take a look. - Just don't pick up. - Who is it? The song was very nice. -I prefer classical myself. - Who is it? Chief inspector Donev. Who are you? - Boryana. - Listen, Boryana. You and your friend are getting on my nerves and I hate that. I know it looks bad, but we're cool. It looks like kidnapping. How's the boy? - He's here and he's fine. - Put him on the phone. - I can't, he's eating. - You know I'm gonna catch you. - We've done nothing wrong. - Everyone says that. Where are you headed? - Who the fuck is it? - Police. Give me the phone. Have you never seen a film? They were trying to track your call. - We didn't manage to track the call. - I know where they're going. VARNA RUSE - Isn't that Ruse? - Last stop. We were going to Varna. That's why we are here. Take the train. Thank you. Saved our asses. - A lot of police. - Yeah, that was a... A pleasure. For me, anyway. Thank you. Don't know what else to say. Good luck. Pretty sure the lorry driver likes you. Pretty sure the lorry driver likes you. Shut up! Both of you. Get going, be back in a sec. Vassil! I wanted to tell you we're not some kind of nut jobs. - It's all a misunderstanding. - You don't owe me an explanation. By the way, what's your real name? Boryana. You're not quite right in the head. I see it's not an appropriate moment. But give me your number and I'll show you how to open a car door with a hanger. The phone situation now is a bit difficult. Had I met you a week before, it'd be different. All right. I'm gonna give you mine, in case you change your mind. Don't take it personally, but it's unlikely to call you, I won't take it personally. I'm a grown man. - Good luck. - Thank you. Your ticket to freedom. - So I'm free? - As a bird. Good luck! You'll need it. - Why did you help us? - Sorry? In the field. Why did you do it? Stockholm syndrome, perhaps. But for the record... I like you too. Good bye! - He's nice. - Who is? Don't pretend. I could see you from an airplane. - You could see what? - Come on. It's not true. Chief inspector Donev. - Why do you need the money? - What money? - Personal stuff. - What kind? This is not an interrogation, right? I don't have to answer. That's right. But I suspect your actions made a criminal out of an ordinary woman. Wait a bit. What's my fault here? She's a friend and I asked her for money. Can't be held responsible for her actions. A friend you say? What kind of a friend is she to you? We're in love. It's complicated because... I'm married. You know how it is. Sometimes I go to Sofia. We spend a night together. - Look... - Cvetan. Cvetan. Boryana's coming to Varna and I'm gonna arrest her. You call me the moment she contacts you. Of course. Inspector, I have to ask you to say nothing to my wife. She's from Varna. We got away this time, but next time we won't be so lucky. We need a plan if we're going to Mexico. - We need passports, tickets, money. - Cvetan will help us. I don't want to get in an argument... Why didn't you asked Martin to join us. What? Someone will surely kidnap him in the train station for real. He's must have called the police by now. Maybe not. We're criminals. We pointed a gun at him, just two hours ago. I'd ask him if I were you. I don't know. See those two? That's us yesterday. Two women waiting for something to happen. There's us today. We act, we don't wait. Two women on riding the wave, without fear of what they want to be. That's not in the Les Miserables, it must be in another book. Make fun at me all you want but today I'm fulfilling my childhood dream! Quiet. What was the dream? To live life to the fullest. Thought it was to be a motocross champion? That's the same. To ride the wave. Hi. Sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. - What you're doing here? - I don't really like trains. So I thought I'll just come with you, instead. If you don't mind? - Let him ride the wave. - What is that mean? It doesn't matter. - You ready? - What for? To ride the wave? Always! Always! - Ok. We need a new car. - And new phones. Any ideas? Take off those stupid glasses. Put your contacts on. - And until then? - Life's a bitch. - You whores? - We're working girls. Working as a doctor, or an architect? How much? - 100 for both. - 100 leva? Are you mad? But, we'll make it worth it. 50. If you don't like it, stay here. - 50 is all right. - Yeah, thought so. Jump in. Let's go somewhere more secluded. - More what? - Secluded. Are you a professor? What are these words? Right, let's seclude. - How long have you been whores? - We're not whores. Watch your tone. You're not whores, you just screw for money. You'll see. Life's a bitch. You'll be so pleased you won't take my money. - Let's go. Take off the panties. - You first. What's going on? What's going on? May I have you keys, please? - What do you want? - Give him the keys. Thank you! Don't do that, girls. Come on, please. - What did I do, come on. - Don't turn back. Don't do that. I've got a family, children. What are you doing here then? Please, girls. Come on. - Here, on your knees. - Please, girls, don't kill me. Don't do that! Come on! Don't kill me! - What did I do? - Called us whores two times. - I didn't want to... - Shut up. Make a sound, I shoot. If you flinch, I shoot. - Make a move and what do you think? - You shoot. Good job, clever boy. Are you a professor? - Sorry. - What are you doing? Yeah, tremble! Good job, Little One. - What the fuck you guys doin'? - Bo and Life's a bitch had an argument. I? Are you ready to ride the wave, gorgeous. What? I just noticed your hair is so beautiful. You could've been a hooker. THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU IN VARNA Stop the car! How did the police find out about Cvetan? What's wrong? Boryana's moronic boyfriend. That what's wrong. Enough with the insults. You're starting to piss me off. - I'm right. He wants to screw us over. - Why did he send the message then? - Is it from him? - Where are we? 100 km outside of Varna. - Don't tell him where we are. - Why? - I don't believe him! Don't tell him! - What do you propose then? Guys, let's go to a motel and work out exactly what to do. Stay in a hotel is too risky. Here is fine, right? Yeah! It's great. Mila, come in the front, if you want. I like it in the back. I'll go for a walk. I'm not sleepy. Be careful thou. I think I just heard a wolf just then. It's dark. It is. - Are you cold? - No. Yes. I don't normally do that. That's a shame. You're very good at it. I mean I don't make out in the backseat of a car with perfect strangers. I don't want you to think of me as an easy woman. I'm looking for a long lasting relationship. Bobby Auto Shop - Hello? - Are you sleeping? Yeah, give me a sec. You know... I was thinking about us. Do you think we could ever be... - Forget it. - Say it. We should talk in person. - Is it a bad time? - No, but one cop was looking for me. - His name is Donev. - What does he want? He wants me to arrange a meeting with you and to arrest you there. - You're not doing that, right? - Of course not. I love you. Where are you? I'm sorry to have dragged you into this. Don't mention it. - You have the money? - Yeah, I have it. All right. I'm sending you a location. Meet you there in the morning. - Is that OK? - All right. I'll be there. I love you. See you tomorrow. What do you normally do, when you're not kidnapping people. I write. I remember you saying. What do you write? - A book. - What kind of a book? Ok. I write is an overstatement. In real life I work at a call centre. And I've been trying to finish my first novel for 10 years now. What's it called? You ready? Mistresses in white. - What? - What's it about? It's about wood nymphs and some other creatures from Bulgarian folklore. That sounds cool. You should think about changing the title thou. - What's wrong with this one? - Mistresses in white? - Sounds like porn! - Come on! Get out of here. So... Why did you decide to come with us? Any excuse to get away from my dad. You'll get bonus points. When you come home after a long and painful kidnapping. I don't think that's gonna fly with him. Why? What kind of person is your Dad? He is controling, he doesn't tolerate anybody else's opinion. And he always gets what he want. You'd hate him. What about your Mom? She lost the battle with my Dad years ago. I actually came to Bulgaria to tell them that I'm dropping out of Uni. Then you should better stay kidnapped. Gladly. Leave me some. What the fuck? Where are my trousers? An SUV! - I can't see shit! - From Ruse. - Fuck! Get the gun! - Boryana has it. - Fuck! - Escalade. Love birds? What are you doing in the woods? Come out, let me have a look at you. Are you coming out or are we coming in? American made. Good night. How did you put out, even with his girly hair? Come out. Hurry up. Hurry up! - We should run. - No. We're not leaving Boryana. Got lucky? I think we're the ones who got lucky. Told you to be silent when talking to me. Guys, let's handle this like civilized people. - Shut up! - Forget about the car and let us go. American? What did the tourist say? Boys, the money is for a sick child. What will you give me for them? Take the car, just leave us with the money. Deal. Let me go! - Don't wrestle! Bitch! - Let me go! Any idea who are you running away from? Motherfucker leave her alone! Shut the fuck up. I'll fucking kill you! I'll show you what's what. I'll ram you! Don't you fucking touch her! You little fucking motherfucker! You fucking bastard! Good night, lover. Don't move! Are you stupid? Get on the fucking ground! On the ground! - On the ground! - Calm down. On the ground, now! You fucking cunt! You fucking motherfucker cunt! Is that a fucking knife? What are we gonna do with those bastards? For backup. What the hell happened? What happened? - Now what? - Well... Have you watched Aliens? Told you to be silent when talking to me. Don't get angry, or I'll show you my little alien. - I'll ram you! - Calm down. - Is that it? - Think so. Call him. Hello? Hello? It think we're in the wrong place. We're in a historic park, there's an archer here. - I'm waiting in my palace. - What palace? King Arthur's. It's that thing over there. What the hell... - What are you doing, Ceco? - Reigning. - Cut the crap. - All right. I'm a security guard. - Did you carve his face like that? - No. Long story. I can hide you in the Medieval village. We can't stay with the police on our tails. They're gonna find us, sooner rather than later. - The village is secure. I guarantee. - Let's see then. - Where can we talk in private? - In my chambers. How can you be sure the police isn't coming? I'm certain. Show some respect to the people helping us. What do you think? - What is Bulgarian for shit-nugget? - Shit what? - Shit-nugget? - Whatever. Probably... - Are you all right? - I'm now. How did you manage to get in this mess? You're all over the news. - Doesn't matter. I've got a plan. - What kind of plan? We want to run away to Mexico. Can you get us passports and tickets? And, most importantly, do you want to come with us? With me? I know it's a surprise. That's our chance to be together. And you've always wanted to run away from your wife. I want to, that's true. What about the kid? So you agree? You're with us? I'm not saying no. I'm with you. But the money... All right. First things first. I'll give the money. Then, we go to Mexico. - I want to come with you. - The girl's in a bad shape. She's very sick and you're wanted. Please! I want to see her, to tell her never to be afraid. They don't let me in. I'll give the money to her parents. I thought she was an orphan. Who's the money for? I asked you a question! It's not for my niece. - It's for me. - Are you sick? I'll be more than sick if I don't have the money. I want you to very precisely tell me what's going on. And don't you dare lie to me! I'm listening. Gambled the money away and pawned the apartment. If I don't find the money, they'll take it. I don't want my wife to find out. She's crazy, as you know. Won't you say anything? - What's going on? - Jump. - Jump! Higher! - All right... Jump! - Jump higher! - I am! Jump again! Jump! Higher I said! - Jump! - The ricochet... Forget the money. Your mom will ricochet. Boryana! - My wife's gonna kill me. - I'll kill you if she won't. Kill me! I love you! Wait! Don't go! Stop them! Stop them at the entrance. Told you so. You told me so. Look what I found. - Stop! - That's enough! Stop the car! Stop. Sorry, Marto. Tell your parents I'm sorry. Come on! I mean fuck the money, but don't give up now. - Take it! - Please! Don't you give up now. WANTED VARNA POLICE DEPARTMENT - We promised not to give up. - There's no other way. Bo! We've got a plan. By the way what made your kidnappers release you? I'm sorry. My son won't answer any questions, until our family lawyer arrives. I'd like to have an informal conversation with him, Mr. Kane, if you don't mind. It's fine, dad. As I've already explained to your colleagues, there are no kidnappers. Because there is no kidnapping. Mila and Boryana are my friends. We just travelled to Varna together, that's all. Obviously, my son is still in shock from the experience, and doesn't know what's he talking about. I want those criminals caught and convicted. Will you stop speaking on my behalf, for just one fucking second. - You mind your language. - Don't treat me like a fucking child. You are going to Cambridge tomorrow, I've already bought you an air ticket. I'm not going back to Uni. We will talk about this when we get home. I'm not coming home either. Martin, this is a family conversation and this is not the place to have it. You and I are having conversations now, that's lovely, thank you. Excuse me, Detective. It would seem my son is capable of taking control of this situation himself. You know your father is right. They must be held accountable for their actions. What actions? They haven't done anything wrong, have they? Really? What happened to your face? - There is no kidnapping. - Let the law be the judge of that. The money is back with it's rightful owner, and I'm really sorry detective, this is just a big misunderstanding. Where are they, Martin? Listen. If you're withholding their location, you're an accomplice to the crime. And you'll be subject to all laws that apply, do you understand that? So... Where are they? They're going back to Sofia. Your father was right about one more thing. You should wait for your lawyer, until we proceed. Coffee? Tea. Inspector. Boryana and Mila are still in town. - Where is that? - I know who might know. Martin? Strange, he said they were going to Sofia. He's lying. He's in love with the Little One. And you with the Big One, wasn't it? So maybe you're lying. Why would I lie to you? Me and Boryana broke it off. - Because of the money? - No. Because I'm from the good guys. I'm on your side. You're getting on my nerves. Cut to the chase. I'll leave it to you how to reward me for what I'm about to say. The girls are going abroad but they need passports and tickets. I'm no inspector, but follow the English boy and you'll find them. I'm sure of it. Just one more thing... Can you help me out with my problem? Naturally. What a jackass. Shaving dry, like in the army. It's a slow read, but it gets good at the end. - Stefka and Evgenyia? - Thelma and Louise were taken. You know that cop that is after you is pretty adamant to catch you. Didn't you tell him it was a huge misunderstanding? I think he's just mad about the truck. He musta fell pretty stupid. No visual contact, cannot confirm their identity. No visual contact. Cannot confirm their identity. Do you want me to move you, so you have a better visibility? Excuse me. - You're not talking to me? - I hate goodbyes. This is not a goodbye. Identity confirmed. I have a visual on the two suspects. - Are you sure? - Positive. I have a visual. Attention all units. The two suspects are on the second floor of the bookstore. I want a perimeter set up and three cars at the back. What the fuck! Did you bring them? - Hands above your head! - No, I didn't! You're under arrest! Nobody move! This is a robbery! That was it, Bo. We are done. Not yet. - We ran away. - Drinks are on you. Ice cream? - Piss off, asshole! Faster! - I'm trying! Where are you going? I'm starting to like you. Get off! Go, go! I'm pushing them downtown. Block the street on the South side of the church. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. It's not safe here. Yeah, you're right. You were right about the sneakers. I'm always right. Bo. Do you think Marty ratted us out? No way. He got followed. We can be certain they'll be waiting for us at the airport. Why? Because I know for sure Cvetan ratted us out. We can do it. After today, nothing's impossible. Nothing's impossible for us anymore. You were smiling in your sleep. What were you dreaming of? - Mexico beach. - Was it nice there? Was I there? Of course you were. You'd just finished your book. What about... Marto was there as well. Really? Really. Keep your eyes peeled. There's nobody here. Take off the glasses if you please. The glasses, mam. Have a nice flight. On your knees! Hands above your head! You're under arrest! I love you, Bo. You're my best friend. I love you, Little One. We had our fun, ladies. Hands above your head. - Hands above your head! - What are you doing? - Something stupid. - Boryana! As usual. They have guns. Boryana! - I lied about the dream. - Don't do this. Boryana! You weren't there. Farewell, Little One. Am I dead? You're complete nut job. Why die now when you learned how to live? Come now. Put your hands above your head. Boryana! Bo, don't do this, please. Donev, I'm listening. Hello? The boy is alright. The kidnappers have been apprehended. Well done. That's what I like to hear. - May I be frank? - Can you? I think they're normal girls. They didn't do anything that bad. You think too much, son. Now, think what you can do for them. Chop chop. Remove the handcuffs. Can I have a cigarette? You're in trouble. Save us the lecture. We're exhausted. Why do you hate us that much? Because we made wildlings out of you, or you just don't like your own life? Must be the second one. You did a marvellous job, you should be proud. Brings us coffee. You're misjudging me, ladies. To tell you the truth, I hoped I wouldn't catch you. Set us free then. Kidnapping, resisting arrest, theft, armed robberies. Illegal possession of a weapon. 45,000 leva in damages. Do you know how many years behind bars that makes? A lot. You know we aren't criminals. I do. Look. You are going to jail, for sure. But after what your buddy Martin said and with a good enough lawyer... You can get a minimal sentence. Just when you start to hate cops, and a good one ruins their reputation. - Raymond Chandler. - You're kidding. Something else? Cream or sugar? I want to make a phone call. - Yes? - You probably know by now. I must warn you. Your husband is a liar and a coward, who doesn't deserve you. He was cheating you with me for a year and I'm terribly sorry. He gambled away your apartment. Get rid of him while you can. Cvetan? SIX MONTHS LATER Boryana. Chewing gum. Necklace. Lipstick. Bracelet. Piece of paper. A scratching ticket. Signature, please. Right. Identity card. Mila. Earrings. Bracelet. Necklace. Wristwatch. - Do you have it? - I do. I just picked it up from the printers. I'm a published writer. So fucking cool! Let me see. The photo's great. You look good without glasses. So. let's go! I'm not coming. What do you mean you're not coming? Of course you're coming. I'm leaving. Where? You well know where, Little One. The first copy is for you, you're my inspiration. I want it signed. WILDLINGS "Ride the wave. - M." Look at that. 100 grand. What? 100 grand? Let me see! Why didn't you scratch it six months ago, you frickin' motor girl? I'll send you half of it. I already have the half I want. Thank you, Martin! Take good care of her, okay? And stay out of trouble. - You stay out of trouble. - Yes, sir! Goodbye, guys! For old time sake. VASIL
