Sir, get me four soft drinks. Is that it? Where's the money? Give it to me as credit. Your credit list is a long one. It's been six months now. Stop it. Please give it to me for one last time. That's what you always say. But you'll never mend your ways. There you go. I hope I don't see you again. Here you go. -It's my turn. -Hold on. Bujji. Dad is here! Dad, why did you bring these? You love them a lot. That is why I brought them. Yay! Chicken curry! Dad, is there some kind of a festival today? Indeed. It's a big festival. A festival we've never celebrated before. Do you want me to design a peacock or a deer? Peacock. Mom, I'll take good care of you once I grow up. How are you going to do that? I won't let you work. I'll adorn you with jewelry. I'll feed you egg curry every day. And... I'll look after you. Whoa! I've heard enough of this. You say this now. But once you're married, your wife will be your priority. In that case, I'll not get married. Marriage? Why are you discussing his marriage? Get ready, we need to go to Jangaon. -Why? -Are we visiting Uncle? Answer me. Nari has fallen sick. What happened to my brother? There's nothing to worry about. Don't panic unnecessarily. He has a fever. Let's go visit him. Bujji. I saved one rupee for you. I'll buy you a snow cone... some chips... and puffed rice. Brother! How dare you leave me alone? Brother! Why did this happen? My brother! My brother! How could you do this to the kids? Mom, why did Uncle and his family have to die? Your aunt had fallen sick and was not able to work. Your uncle could do nothing without her help. That is why they got into a lot of debt. Do people kill themselves when in debt? He's a man of virtues, son. He didn't want to live after he lost his dignity. Bujji wasn't the one in debt. Why did she have to die? It was a mistake. He shouldn't have done that. If you aren't able to work anymore, would the same thing happen to us? Everyone faces hardships, my dear. We need to try and face them boldly. Life is all about success and failure. Nothing is constant. Mallesham. Remember one thing. During tough times, you may feel helpless. But if you muster courage and think calmly, you'll find many opportunities. Mom! What is it? Come here. Wait a minute. Come fast. What is it? Sit down. -What is it? -Place your hand inside this. What is this? Place your hand inside this. And start working. It's good but it lowers my speed. Let's try this some other time. Alright? Bye. Mallesham. -Mallesham. -Come in. What are you doing? Mom's arm hurts from working all day long. I'm making this to take the burden off her. What kind of work is she into? She creates designs on saris. She needs to move the thread back and forth. It's an art. Mom creates a design and Dad makes a sari out of it. That's alright. Let's play now. Okay, let's go. GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL SARAJI PET VILLAGE, NALGONDA DISTRICT. Rao Gopal Rao kills Chiranjeevi's father. Chiranjeevi gets really furious. He kills Rao Gopal Rao and that's it. Is this how you narrate a story? You suck at it. Raju, go ahead. Get lost! Do you want to enact that once again? You are not good at studies. And you're wasting your time singing and dancing. Kneel down. Kids, I taught you a lesson yesterday. Did you finish your homework? Yes, sir. Veera Pratap, stand up. What do you call a Puli in English? Tiger, sir. Very good, sit down. Stand up. What do you call a Nemali in English? I'm talking to you! Answer me! Didn't you hear me? What's a Nemali called in English? You should've answered me sooner. Sit down. Mallesham! Damn it! Spell "Peacock" for me. Spell it one more time. Spell it once again. He's spelling it differently each time. Now, I am confused. I'll have to check the dictionary. You're doing great. Sit down. My exams are in two weeks. How do I finish reading all these books? Don't get worried. Just keep studying. Take a look at this spool of thread. Mom, the spools are full in the mornings. By the time I'm back home, they are completely empty. How do you get all the work done? No matter how big a task is, doing it in smaller parts will help the task finish itself. Got it. What is this? There are only six saris. Lakshmi is suffering from severe shoulder pain. She didn't weave for a couple of days. I understand. But I am answerable to the clients. I need some more money this month. You know me. I spent a lot of money on my daughter's wedding. You're not getting any extra money. Don't ask for advance payments for the next two months. This is not an auspicious time for weddings. Look at this. It's damaged. I'm deducting ten rupees. That's like calling a beauty spot ugly. A few flaws make it more beautiful. This is what makes this sari unique. The art of weaving is a century old. You already know that. This is what happens when the dyes are mixed. Look. Both of us know this. But the clients don't. Here's your money. See you. We toil day and night to earn this. After paying our debts, we'll have nothing left to feed ourselves with. Mallesham. Yes, Dad? You have to start working on the loom. Or else, we won't survive. What about school, Dad? You'll have to manage both. -Veera Pratap. -Yes? Lend me a few drops of ink. Raju! I gave you two drops now and three earlier. Including the interest, you now owe me nine drops. Okay. GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL SARAJI PET VILLAGE, NALGONDA DISTRICT. This message is for all the students, especially Anji and Mallesham. The exams are finally over. It's all fun and games from tomorrow. Yay! The kids are playing games In the lap of nature Amidst the clamor The cool breeze whistles Kids sing their heart out In pools of water In the old well kids tend to play around The kids are playing games In the lap of nature Amidst the clamor The cool breeze whistles Like a fish in the pond Like the calves jumping high Dance to the fullest Come on Snap your fingers Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping With the streams reflecting moonlight In the day There are showers of rain Sparkling like pearls With the blowing winds Bringing an array of flowers There are peacocks Dancing like a rising wave With the gleaming soil Spread across the land There is a temple of stones Echoing music With the kids building sandcastles With their little hands There are birds sending an invite From their nests With the reminiscence Of games played outdoors There are days when hide and seek Is greatly missed With the exhilaration That hopscotch has to offer There are shooting stars We can't stop counting on Dance to the fullest Come on, rock and roll Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping With the spinning top Taking you for a ride There are instances of mischief Sneaking in Kids sing their heart out In pools of water In the old well kids tend to play around The kids are playing games In the lap of nature Amidst the clamor The cool breeze whistles Like a fish in the pond Like the calves jumping high Dance to the fullest Come on Snap your fingers Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping Keep beating the drums Keep your fingers snapping Special marbles! Veera Pratap, won't you let us play with your marbles? Get lost. It's okay if he doesn't want to share. -Let's play with our marbles. -Okay. Hit the light blue marble. It's a foul. I asked you to hit the dark blue one. Are you blind? You mentioned the light blue one. What did you say? Why did you hit him? Hey, that sounds like an NTR film! It's great. Veera Pratap, please move. Please move. Let's find a different spot. Veera Pratap, please let us watch. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Mom asked me to get her some thread made out of silk. Take it. Sir, does this work? No. It's been in that corner for a very long time. Can I have it? Sure, go ahead. No. Let's get it fixed. Yeah, right. Take it away, my dear. You keep donating stuff. What will you do with it? Take it. Dad, I need some money. What for? I need to buy books for the seventh grade. No more school for you. Everyone else has progressed to the seventh grade. Their fathers... can afford it. I don't have that kind of money. Get to the loom and start weaving. I want to go to school. Please let me study further! Do you want me to beat you up? Sit down, son. Mom, why is Dad always mad at me? He's not mad at you. Dad loves you a lot. When you were little, you had a severe fever. The doctors said that you wouldn't survive. Dad prayed to Lord Shiva. Once you recovered, he walked in the scorching heat for three long days. Take a look at this. I'll teach you how to join two pieces of thread. Take the thread. Join the broken thread. Hold this for me. Hold it like this. Dampen it and join it like this. Let them blend into each other seamlessly. Try it. Take the thread from the block. Hey, Mallesham! Mallesham! What is it? Look at what we've got for you. A snack! How did you get it? I hid it from sir and brought it. I got the bottom crispy layer because it's your favorite. Gangaram gave it to me when I offered to clean the vessels. I said I'd do it tomorrow. Guess what? Our teacher beat the crap out of Veera Pratap today. Good! He deserves it. I really miss school. I feel like coming back. Mr. Rama Swamy mentioned you a few times. He said he'd talk to your father. Have it. Narasimhulu! Narasimhulu... What's the matter? Your son's not attending school. We've earned more money since he started weaving. He is helping us to clear our debt. That's not fair. You need to send him to school. You can't make him work at this age. I would have sent him to school if I could afford it. Mallesham. Come here. Listen to me. If you want to study, there is always a way. Here. Keep this dictionary. -It's very useful. -Okay, sir. Hey, Mallesham. Mallesham! Do you want to go swimming? Who's that? A golden rooster, it seems! When did it come? It gets reflected on the edges of a sari The mirror begins to sparkle brightly In our town of weavers We live by the art of weaving Mom, Raju dances to this song just like Chiranjeevi. Anji is a good singer. I agree. But he's not good at anything else. He'll end up begging on the streets. -Mallesham! -Yes? Anji needs your help fixing a fan. Let's go. Okay. Here he is. Useless guy! He doesn't work or let anyone else work. Wow! I'm glad you're here. He's having trouble fixing the fan. Please help him out. That is why we're here. Take a look at this. I'll fix it. Why did you leave the parts lying around? Be careful. Be careful with the fan. Hold on. -Anji. -Yes? Switch it on. Will it work? Oh no, we are dead! Let's get out of here. Are you going to kill me? I should blame you, not your stupid friends! It didn't fall on you. Shut up! Don't tell me where it fell. I hope you rot in hell. Who asked you to fix the bloody fan? My grandma will kill me if she knows I spent the money on a movie ticket. -I don't know what to tell her. -Just forget about it. The tickets are sold out. Look at how that weirdo is staring at us. Do you know her? Let's go teach him a lesson. Calm down. -Hey, how are you? -Do you know me? Hey! You're Mr. Venkateshwarlu's daughter! I remember now. I saw you at my sister's wedding. You were a baby back then. So were you. Hey! I got the tickets! -Tickets? -Yes! Could you get us two tickets, please? I'll go get them. Who are they? Take it. Thank you very much. I owe you for this. I'll see you during the intermission. Really? Wait a minute. Why? -Why are you giving me the third one? -Please give it to Vani. I see! -Tell Vani that I bought it. -Okay. Did you like it? Yes. Did you tell Vani that I bought the chips? Padma took all the chips. She shared half of it with me. Does Vani know my name? Does she know that I'm your friend? Padma remembers my name even after all these years. Why are you talking about Padma? I'm asking you about Vani and you're talking about Padma. Is Padma that beautiful? Anji, tell us the truth. Who looks better? Padma or Vani? My grandma gave me money to buy some rice. You took the money to buy the tickets. And he went to watch the movie. You bought the chips. And he ate them. You used my money. My grandma will kill me if she gets to know about this. And you have the audacity to ask me who looks better. My grandma will answer that question, let's go. No, thanks! Mom, what happened? Nothing, my dear. Her shoulder bones are wearing out. She needs to stop weaving. Or else, her arms will no longer remain functional. Every woman working on the loom is going through the same issue. The work is wearing you out, Mom. Why don't you go to Bhiwandi or Surat? -Many villagers are migrating there. -Hey! It doesn't hurt that bad. If I apply boiled onion and turmeric to my shoulder, it will be fine. Your sister moved to Surat and I get to see her only once in three years. Let him go! He's not a kid. Many people are migrating. Half of the villagers are in Bhiwandi. This needs to stop. Take these medicines. Despite being in so much pain, you don't express it. Let him go to Bhiwandi for work. It will reduce our burden. No. I get to see our daughter once every three years. I don't care what happens to me. I want my son to be right here in front of my eyes. You never listen to me. Will you keep doing it until you lose your arm? Mom is not able to weave anymore. I could learn weaving. But that wouldn't suffice. I'm really worried. How do I get through this? Damn it! No matter how big a task is, doing it in smaller parts will help the task finish itself. What happened, son? Mom, I have a great idea! It's going to help relieve your pain. Trust me. Shall we go around? Shall we wander the streets? Shall we have a taste of toddy? Shall we debone a goat? And relish the marinated meat? Shall we debone a goat? And relish the marinated meat? Let's taste the curry on a leaf platter What kind of a song is that? Watch me perform! Hey, Raju! Anji... I've got a really good idea. Listen to me. Similar to the wooden weaving tool, we'll create a machine which will have 40 pins. We'll insert a beam near one of its side and a wheel on top of it. We'll then tie a shaft to it. When we rotate the wheel, the thread would wrap around the pins. And then it wound wraps around the rod. So on and so forth. If we attach a motor to it, it will go on and on... It will keep rotating. Well said, man! What did you understand? It's simple, man. We break a cycle into half. We'll tie one half of it to the pillar. A pulley from the well will be connected to the wheel. Then, we'll insert the cycle chain. Someone should punch you in the face. Guys... I need some money. I wish I could get a loan. Don't worry. I will take care of it. Count it. Pay it back on time. This is the machine. Are you kidding me? I swear, this is it. Does nailing four pieces of wood, attaching two wheels and wrapping thread around it, make it a machine? This is just a prototype, man. I need to attach the wheel and the motor. It needs a lot of work. You took six months to build a prototype. Will you take six years to create the final product? Come on, Anji. Let's go. Not sure about the weaving machine, but he'll surely make a cotton candy machine. We're leaving, Mallesham. Hey, Engineer! -What makes you think he's an engineer? -I bet he is one. -Is that so? -Will he face the same destiny as his uncle? What's gotten into you, boy? Get married! You'll have a wife and she'll bring home a dowry. She'll help you with the weaving. Do you want to end up having debts? Now I understand why your husband passed away. Mallesham! Mom, come here. Watch this. The thread wraps around the rod without you having to touch it. Wait a minute. We need to attend the Muharram celebrations tomorrow. It's been a long time. Come on, mom! You always do this to me. I'll do anything for you. But I'll not be a part of that festival. This is ridiculous. Mom could have offered food or clothes. But she made me dress up like a girl instead. This is horrible! It's because you look good when you wear women's clothes. Oh, Olampalli Jambiya Oh, Olampalli Jambiya Talk to me, Oh Nampalli Jambiya Talk to me, Oh Nampalli Jambiya What does our Nallagonda Moulali desire? What does our Nallagonda Moulali desire? Lord wishes for baskets and scarves Lord wishes for baskets and scarves Baskets for the lord Scarves for the lord Baskets for the lord Scarves for the lord Let's dance, Kasima Let's dance, Kasima Dance, Kasima Jump into the firepit Dance, Kasima Jump into the firepit Let's offer the red scarf And the shiny pink scarf Let's offer the red scarf And the shiny pink scarf Let's go door to door Collect coconuts and jaggery for the lord Let's go door to door Collect coconuts and jaggery for the lord Let's dance With the fragrance of jasmine in the air Let's dance With the fragrance of jasmine in the air -Dance and shake a leg -Dance away -Dance and shake a leg -Dance away Let's forget caste and religion And dance together as one Let's forget caste and religion And dance together as one No, son. Please don't do that. No! No! -Veera Pratap is arriving. -Veera Pratap is arriving! Why are you here, Yadi? I want to meet the other debtors. What are you looking at? Get back to work. Sir, these few grains are all I have left. If you take it away, I'll die of starvation. Just die then. Good riddance! Your life is pointless. If you die, the government will clear your debt. When you guys want money, you plead and beg. When it's time to repay it, you show your true colors. I can't trust anyone these days. Veera Pratap. He is facing a lot of trouble. Why don't you give him some time? Why are you defending him? Go, clear your debt first. I thought of letting the old man go. But you interfered. There's no way I'm letting him go now. Hey! Make it quick. His wife is unable to weave because her arm is not functional anymore. That is why this has happened. Once I manage to build the machine... no one will have to suffer. Hear that, everyone? Mallesham is making a machine for us. If that works out, none of us will have to work anymore. A useless guy wants to invent a machine now! The five holy saints, Saint Markandeya, and Saint Bhavana were returning from Vaikunthapuram. They were carrying 66 yards of thread. -I see! -A monster named Kaluvasura invaded. He swallowed the yards of thread. Then, they assassinated him and transformed his body into a loom. -And this is how they did it. -Go on. Tell us how. He converted the head Into a spherical part He made his throat the rod Using his brains as the shuttle... Stop it! I need to speak to you! You're asking us to use 30 pins for new designs. And we're supposed to keep rotating those pins. How do you expect us to deliver such humongous volumes? Aren't we human? Guys, I'm saying this for your own well-being. Times have changed. Our designs need to change as well. We need to weave to suit people's choices. We'll have no buyers if we don't adapt. Previously, we had to deal with six or seven pins. Now, you are asking us to use 30 pins! Our arms can't stretch that far. We don't mind rolling cigars or stitching dining leaves. But we won't weave anymore. If women stop weaving, the men will be left with nothing to sell. We'll have to take up labor work. We can't let the craft take our lives. Forget it. Mallesham is our savior now. Mallesham is like Saint Bhavana. Let's all raise the money... and give it to Mallesham. He'll build a weaving machine for us just like Saint Bhavana did. That's never going to happen. Ask him to clear our debt first. He owes me money. What about me? Bloody hell! You've taken so many loans. You're bearing all these insults. You are hell-bent on building that machine. Why don't you migrate to Surat or Bhiwandi for a living? I need to build that machine. Because no one else will. No one else can relate to our suffering. Our torment lies in the art itself. If I build the machine... we won't have to live in the slums of Surat or Bhiwandi. We don't realize how great our art is. How do you expect someone else to realize it? We failed to convince him to stop working on that machine. Please try to convince him. Everyone should do what they are supposed to do. Weavers have to weave and painters have to paint. Otherwise, things will go out of order. The only way to stop his madness is to get him married. I don't want to get married now. Please agree, my dear. The girl is really beautiful. Don't marry someone too beautiful. A cramped-up house and a simple looking wife is ideal. Or else, you'll have trouble later on. Why are you so stubborn? Why are you not listening to us? Stop fooling around. You're getting married! Mom! I don't want to get married. You can't force him. We can't help him if he doesn't want to be helped. We'll have to deny Venkateswarulu's offer. Who is it, Mom? Who is it? Hold on. You can't enter until you mention each other's names. She is sleepy. Did you hear that? They just got married and he's already defending her. It doesn't matter. I won't let you in until you mention each other's names. It's pouring heavily The blankets are getting wet Let us in, sisters It's time It is not pouring heavily The blankets aren't wet How can we let you in? I'll give you pearls And garlands made of flowers I shall present worldly gifts I'll give you unicorns And kingdoms to rule Cattle to graze and buffaloes for dairy A shepherd to look after them And a blanket to keep him warm Let us in, sisters It's time No way! You have to say the names. Padma. My dear. That's not his name. Mallesham. Promise me that your daughter will marry my son in the future. I promise. I want to hear that from her, not you. Just say yes, Aunt. We're talking about you. We're here for each other Our hearts sway on a cradle together You're a part of me Nothing can separate us Our union becomes an epitome of love As we be our sweetest selves to each other We play around We get all mischievous and cute So many hopes aboard So many imaginations flying They've got us entangled So many smiles blooming So many colors spilling They've got our glances fixed This way... Fold it like this. Hold it. Here you go. A folded sari should instantly grab attention. That's not how you're supposed to do it. Like a bouquet of flowers Our hearts sway on a cradle together Like the pair of a mynah and a parrot Our union becomes an epitome of love So many dawns and kisses They reflect upon the holy thread So many chuckles and giggles They bring beauty to our couple We're here for each other Our hearts sway on a cradle together What happened, Padma? When people said that weaving is tough, I had no idea that it was so difficult. Now that I'm doing it, I know how difficult it is. It's only been six months and my shoulder is hurting so much. I wonder how Mother-in-law has been doing it for so many years. What if I say that you don't have to weave anymore? That would be great. What are you going to do about it? Well, I'll build a machine. Both our families warned me about the machine. I was asked to keep you away from the machine. What can I do? Everyone opposes it. But I've been noticing something. You really care a lot about that machine. Look how the thread spins around it without having to do it manually. This is like the first step. The cycle wheel and the threading process is the second step. Three more steps and our machine will be ready. My dear, I don't care what people say. -Start working on the machine again. -How do I do it? I don't have a single penny in hand. I've got a lot of money. We can make many such machines using that. How much money do you think you have, Padma? I have 1,000 rupees. Let's do it. Noticed your lights were on and realized that you had started working on it again. Listen to me. Don't tell anyone until I'm finished. People have varied opinions. Why do you care about their opinions? You have to do certain things at a certain age. There's no point regretting once you're old. You're the only one who understands my pain. Carry on. He's all about the talk and no money. He's coming here. Hey, there! Hey, Anji. Hey! Let's party tonight. Why? Because the entire village thinks that you're insane? Or, because they're mocking us for being your friends? Why is he saying that? He is the guarantor for your loans, and the lenders are pestering him. You need to start repaying your loans. Of course, I'm aware of it. When will you start doing it? Bloody hell! It's the same nuisance in public and at home. I'm here to have a good time with you and there you go again. Padma gave me some money. The third step is almost over. Third step? That is why I'm here to party with you guys. How many steps are yet to go? It will be done, man. Now what? Yeah, sure. We've been hearing that for so long. Why don't you stop daydreaming? If we stop dreaming, what else do we have left in this world? We have the right to dream. But your dreams are all colorful. There's a rumor going around in the village. People say you talk to your machine. We also heard you name it. Is it Rambha or Ramya Krishna? Hey! It's not Rambha or Ramya Krishna. It's Lakshmi. My mother's name. You guys can take a look at my machine tomorrow. I'll also serve you rice flour pancakes. Anji, bring your buffaloes along with you. Make more pancakes for me then. The thread wraps around the rod and then onto the pins. And now, when I press this... the thread falls around the pin and that's about it. Turn the motor on. Hey! Get a cloth. Go! Turn the motor off. Now! Did it burst? Oh, no! It was working well yesterday. Look! That's how I made all of this. Mallesham! Mallesham! Come on out. I'm coming. Bro, why did you come home? You could have called me. Yeah, right. You want us to invite you home? You haven't even paid me the interest. Bro, please don't yell. I'll clear your debt in two months. Two months? I'll give you two day's time. I'll mortgage your house if you don't pay up. I don't have a single penny right now. If you haven't got the money, sell your wife and pay up. Watch your tongue! What have you gotten yourself into? I've run this family for so long. I cleared all my debts. Has a loan shark ever been to this house? Mallesham. What have you done? You put our family at stake for the machine. For the first time in my life, Mom scolded me. I haven't failed, Padma. I'm paying the interest every month. The entire village knows that my machine has burned down. They're asking me for the principal amount. They aren't even giving me a couple of days. Everyone wants the money at the same time. How can I pay all of them at once? I'll get a new motor. I'll run the machine. Then, the villagers will believe in me. Mr. Veera Pratap. On the eve of the Sankranti festival, my holy cow bows to you. Greetings, Mr. Veera Pratap. Thank you for giving alms to the holy cow. Hey, Mallesham! It's been so long. I heard that your machine burned down. -Well... -Tell me why you're here. I need a small loan. I knew it the minute you showed up. I must be the only one left in the village. You were great at the marble game when we were kids. But he'd cheat a lot. Me? Don't act innocent. He was a bully. You, Raju and Anji stole my shorts once. You hit us so many times, so... I will lend you the money. But I need to settle a score. Remember you hit me when we were kids? Apologize for it and touch my feet for forgiveness. Then, I'll give you the money. You're home. Come in. I've been waiting since morning. Since it's Pongol, I wanted to visit the temple. Wait. I'll bring you some snacks. The snacks are really tasty. Your mom made them. Taste it. Why are you sad on a festive day? Everything will be okay. Don't you worry. Padma, can I ask you something? Sure. I need materials for the machine. No one in the village is lending me money. If you could give me your gold chain and bangles, I'll pawn them and... I swear I'll get them back once the machine is made. Ever since we got married, have I ever asked you for anything? My parents gave me those jewels. That's all I have of them. I don't expect anything from you. But don't ask me for my jewelry. You don't trust me. Why are you giving me excuses? You gave me hope when no one believed in me. But you consider me insane, like everyone else does. Am I right? I trust you. You are free to assume things. I'm not giving you my jewelry. You would've given it to me if you had believed in me. I don't need money to booze or fool around. You're all talk. If you don't give me the jewelry, what will I do? I think I should die. Don't say another word. I'm tired of men in our families threatening us with suicide. If you are not capable of facing your problems, then go die! But, don't use me as your excuse to die. My dear! I was angry. Don't take it to your heart. I get really furious when I hear people mention that word. I said it out of anger. Please don't mind me. Let go, Padma. -Dear... -Let go! He won't go anywhere, my dear. He'll come back. Come, let's have dinner. We looked everywhere. But we couldn't find him. Don't panic, Padma. He's not going anywhere. He'll be home by dawn. Mom and Dad will come back day after tomorrow. Say yes to anything they ask for. I'll take care of the rest. And we don't want any dowry. Let's have a simple wedding. We can share the expenses. Do you want to see the girl? That's not necessary. He fell for her the first time he saw her at the movie theater. Ask Padma if she likes me. She likes you. Has a loan shark ever been to this house? You put our family at stake for the machine. Apologize for it and touch my feet for forgiveness. Then, I'll give you the money. If you are not capable of facing problems, then go die! Our worst fears have come true. The bride's family has come to know about your debts. They have called off the wedding. Our daughter is lucky because we figured things out before the wedding. We are merchants. Our debt compelled us to accept that marriage proposal. She'll have to keep weaving her whole life if she marries him. How can they call it off? We can't blame them. Because of his machine, we are getting humiliated. In that case, let's accept that teacher's proposal from Sircilla. Alright. Let's go ahead with that. What about my preferences? I want to marry Mallesham. Are you out of your mind? He's drowning in debt because of that machine. How is he going to feed you? He's in debt and yet he didn't demand a dowry. He's also willing to pay half of the wedding expenses. Did any of the suitors ask me if I liked their proposal... except Mallesham? During tough times, you may feel helpless. But if you muster courage and think calmly, you'll find many opportunities. Hey, you had us really worried. Where have you been? Mallesham. Where were you, son? I left my family behind to be with you. What would I have done without you? I'm sorry, Padma. I've gotten so occupied with the machine... that I didn't care for you. You bore insults for being my wife. I never made you happy. I often resolve to not touch the machine again. I try not to think about it. But I'm unable to do it, Padma. Whether I'm awake or asleep... Whether I'm idle or busy... That machine is the only thing on my mind, Padma. What should I do, Padma? What should I do? Resume your work. Are you serious? Yes, I am. But I have one condition. It's Pongol today. Let's have a deadline of two years. I hope you finish it before the deadline. Otherwise, you'll stop worrying about the machine for good. Yes, Padma. I'll build the machine in two years. I'll show you the finished product first. Dear, let's move to the city. These people here will not let you work in peace. Okay, Padma. Let's go to the city and get a job. After that, we can come back and work on the machine. Starting a whole new life A new direction Every footstep seems strange But with every slip I'm motivated To rise again Padma! I'm going to meet my friend. He said he'll help me rent an auto rickshaw. I'm so used to cooking on firewood. I wonder how I'll manage with this. Let me show you. A silver lining will always be there Behind a dark cloud Please adjust for a few days, Padma. I like it here. Okay, then. I'll get going. Be careful. Grit and determination is needed To face the rising tides of life Bro, can you take me to Koti? You said there were only three people. Are you counting the kids as well? There are stars lining The horizons of darkness There are rain drops showering From the rumbling clouds Why is the fare so high? It doesn't cost this much from Sultan Bazar to Musheerabad. -No, sir. The meter is correct. -Did you rig the meter? Sir, they increased the minimum fare. Oh, no! How many times have I told you not to wait up for me? How many times have I asked you not to work so late? I already told you I get double the fare at night. That doesn't mean you have to drive nonstop. I understand we have to save for the machine. But you also have to take care of yourself. Wow! Tamarind leaves and fish curry. I'm unstoppable as long as I eat your food. Stop pulling my leg, my dear. Stop! Stop! Wow! Have you ever had such a handsome guy in your auto? Fool! Take me to Madhapur. The girls out there are crazy about me. Venkata Lakshmi from the seventh grade. Padmaja from the tenth grade. Indraja from the eleventh grade. Are you listening to me? Yes. Durga who is pursuing her graduation. Why do you look so shocked? Girls go gaga over me. Stop! Stop! We've reached Madhapur. This is Madhapur. I thought it was close by. But we've come quite far. You feel so because you're new here. So, did you listen to my love story? Yes, I did. Okay, then. Name my girlfriends correctly and I'll pay you. Tell me. Tell me. -Venkata Lakshmi. -Right. Go on. -Padmaja. -Yes. Durga. How could you forget Indraja? It's Indraja, man. I'm not going to pay you. You forgot Indraja. I'm not paying you. Hey! You should demand your money, man. You look way too innocent. You can't be so nice and sweet. Here, take it. -46 rupees. -Yes, take it. Keep the change. A drunkard is always honest. You forgot Indraja! Okay, get lost now. Do you think I can make money off flowers? Of course, you will make a lot of money. I didn't have a single penny when I first moved to the city. Look at me now. I own two properties. How much? I settled their tiff. But they didn't give me any toddy or tobacco. -You should've asked him. -He is ungrateful. Hey, fool! What are you doing here? You quit driving the auto and started selling flowers now? Why aren't you yelling? Who's going to buy your stuff if they can't hear you? Actually... Let me see you sell some flowers. Show me how you'll sell flowers. Flowers! Flowers! Flowers! Did you hear that? Who's going to fall for that? Selling is an art. Want to know how it's done? Bread! Bread! Freshly baked bread! This is how you do it. How do you sell ice cream? Ice cream! Ice cream! Dig into it, lad! Ice cream! Ice cream! Dig into it, lad! That's how you do it. You are really naive. But you are a nice guy. Go, sell them now. Your business will bloom. Thanks, bro. Flowers, ma'am! Flowers! Flowers! -Flowers, ma'am! Flowers! Flowers! -Give me some alms, sir. -Give me one rupee, please. -Flowers! Flowers! Flowers... Flowers! Flowers! -Do you want to buy some flowers? -No, thanks. -Buy them for two rupees. -No. -Do you want to buy some flowers? -No, thanks. Sir, give me some alms. Tea! Tea! Hot tea! Delicate and beautiful jasmine flowers! Flowers! Jasmines, jasmines! Oh! Looks like my dear husband is upset. Don't be angry, my dear. You're not used to selling flowers. Why don't you get back to driving the auto? None of the drivers use their meters anymore. I make no profit when I turn the meter on. I'm thinking of driving a trolley auto. Okay. Go ahead with that. The tea tastes good, eh? Not really. Come on. Load them in. The load is too heavy, bro. Here you go. -It's done. -All right. The auto is completely damaged, my dear. The owner is really upset. I'm really worried. I'll figure something out. Go home. You haven't slept all night. No, my dear. I'll stay with you. The doctor said that I'm fine. I'll be home by tomorrow. Go home, Padma. Take care, my dear. Bro, what do you do for a living? I'm an electrician. What do you do? I drove an auto until recently. But I had an accident. What's that book all about? This one? It's about electrical circuits. I've had this book since my college days. I've been trying to pass this exam for four years. I have to pass it this time. Are you looking at the pictures? No, bro. I understood a little bit of it. You said you only studied till sixth grade. How did you manage to understand it? That's true, but I passed tenth grade through distance education. I passed in the third attempt recently. Okay. Solve this. 2.3. Prove it. You don't understand English. So, how did you manage it? English has always been a challenge for me. That is why I always carry a dictionary. Go on. Prove it. Current and resistance are like a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law duo. One calms down while the other fires up. How did you figure out the complex circuit? You just have to divide it into small parts. Our company has a vacancy for an electrician's assistant. Will you do it? I really love electrical work, bro. I blew up many motors during my research. Please get me this job. Why are you pulling the wrong wire? I'm pulling the supply line. I'll finish it today. What should I tell the owner? -We'll finish it, sir. -I can't depend on you guys. -Sir! Hello, sir. -Hey, Kiran. Weren't you supposed to be back in two days? I was at the hospital. Excuses, excuses! Hospital, exams, weddings. You keep fooling around. Why are you so angry, sir? This is no big deal. You asked for a helper. I have the right guy for you. -Hello, sir. -Hello. Do you have any experience? -No. -Yes... Do you have it, or not? He does, sir. Why else would I recommend him? He's a good worker. Listen! I don't tolerate substandard work. I want this job finished in a month. He met with an accident. If you could get him an advance... Do you want an advance for nothing? Just get a table and chair for me. I'll give advance payments to everyone. To hell with the tasks. You're experienced, aren't you? Hey, Mallesham. -Keep it. -I don't want your money, bro. You can pay me back once you get your salary. Okay? Thanks a lot. You don't have to thank me. -I'll start working on the machine. -Machine? Yes. Padma! Thank God you're home. I was waiting for you. Look, I brought you something. A sari! It's very beautiful. I've always weaved these, but I never got to wear one. Why did you buy it? I've got a job, Padma. That's great news, my dear. I also have something for you. What is it? Be patient! What is it? It's not Pongol yet. Why did you make special snacks? Don't you realize something? It's just a smiley face. There's a mini snack ring in the middle. Padma! You've given me such wonderful news! We'll have a baby girl. She'll bring us good luck. I can't wait to hold her. You don't believe in superstitions, do you? This is different! Narasimha, how are you? I'm good. Your son sent you money. Sign this. -Here? -Yes. I'm leaving you alone for the first time, my dear. It's okay. I'll be visiting you. Take care of yourself. Don't lift heavy stuff. I'll drop you home and I'll also get the machine here. Sure. But don't let it consume all your time. Please eat and sleep on time. Will food and sleep help build the machine? Will starving and pulling all-nighters help build the machine? Mom! -How are you? -I'm good. -How are you, my dear? -Hi! -How are you? -I'm fine. Come on. It's been so long. -When did you leave? -We left early in the morning. Let's pray that you have a safe pregnancy. Sit down. Where's your nuptial chain? You don't have your gold bangles either. We pawned it. Pawned it? For what? We pawned it for the machine, Mom. Without asking us? How could he pawn the gold we gave you? He'll get them back. The machine will be done soon. Yeah, right! He'll sell everything for that machine. I wonder what he'll do to you next. Why don't you lower your voice, Mom? Don't embarrass him. I don't care. He's a lunatic. Didn't we warn you before the wedding? Stop it, Dad. My dear... My dear... How can I live in a place where you aren't respected? I'll go with you. Padma, stay here for a few more months. I don't think my mom will be able to help you. Let's go back to the city. We'll be together through thick and thin. You need to build the machine. Those who insulted you should sing your praises. My parents should proudly boast about their son-in-law. Don't take it to heart, Padma. Forget about it. You are not able to work on the machine because of me. I should've stayed at my parents' house. Go to sleep, Padma. Let's talk tomorrow. My dear... My stomach hurts. Wait a minute. Padma... Padma! -What is it? -There's blood on the sheets! Get up. Let's go to the doctor. Be careful. She has a low-lying placenta. Otherwise, there are no other issues. She needs a lot of bed rest. Or, there might be complications later on. Is there anyone to look after her? I'll prescribe some medicines. Make sure she has them regularly. Thank you. What did the doctor say? She needs a lot of bed rest. Did she say anything else? Two teas, please. Don't be worried. I know how important this machine is to you. It won't take too long. About five months, right? Time passes in the blink of an eye. Why don't you leave an hour early from work? I'll take care of the rest. Thanks a lot, bro. Don't be silly. Do you want to eat something in particular? I want to eat curd and rice. It should be spicy as well. Mom's blessings and Dad's nurturing That's how it's going to be from now on It's delicious. It's Padma rice. Padma rice? Curd rice with spices and garlic becomes Padma rice. Shall I take care of you? Shall I pamper you like a little baby? Whoa! You have a place for me in your heart! Do you want me to design a peacock, or a deer? Which one is harder? Peacock. Then, I want peacocks. Shall I feed you with my own hands? Shall I admire your cute self? Shall I regale you with stories? Shall I brighten your mood? Gift this father The little soul growing inside of you And I shall gift the invention in my brain To the world Be careful. Mom! Mom! You've arrived! My sweetheart! My cutie pie has arrived! Your grandpa decorated the entire house for your first Pongol. Look at your grandpa. I think it's my mother. Thank you for coming home. It's been very long. Let's put her in the cradle. Okay, let's do it. My sweet baby! What are you doing? Why are you touching that wretched machine? I'm taking it to the city. Are you insane? You endured so much ridicule. What more do you want? Why are you doing this again? I'll do it right this time. This is the cause of all our troubles. This has ruined our lives. Let this machine rot! Dad! Dad, what are you doing? What the hell is this, Dad? Dad! Stop it. Dad! Dad! Dad! Mallesham! No! No! You worked so hard all these years. Your dad burned the entire thing. That's ridiculous! It's okay, Mallesham. Think of it as a blessing. Forget about the machine and find a good job. To hell with all this! Why are all fathers like this? They don't let you do anything. They're against change. Hey... Do you think fathers who don't care about their sons, are great? Your parents may have been harsh, but they made sure you had food to eat. What do you guys know about the pain of not having parents? Have you gone crazy? You were crying, and all of a sudden you're laughing. It's impossible to make this machine work with a wooden frame. I was holding onto it because I had spent so much money on it. My dad did me a favor by burning it. Wait and watch. I'll make an amazing model using metal. An amazing one! Wait and watch. Do you want to make the machine using metal? I'll look into it. There is a guy who can do this. But he is a little crazy. Life is amazing! It's like a cow that's grazing! Wow! Amazing poetry! Abdul, I need money for the child's school fees. May he study well and become an engineer. Here you go. Thank you, bye. How was my poetry? Amazing! -Abdul. -Yes? Why are you here? -Greetings, Abdul. -Greetings. -This is Mallesham, my close friend. -Greetings. He needs your help. I need to build this machine. These blueprints are an engineer's work. Abdul duplicates parts. He doesn't make machines. Bro, your lathe machine remains idle during your poetry session. Teach him once, and he will do it himself. He will pay you as well. When God was handing out knowledge, were you sleeping? Don't you understand? Not these designs, bring me a sample instead. Bro, where did you get this scarf from? No one has made them in the past ten years. My grandfather gifted it to me when I was a kid. I have searched for this in every nook and corner of Hyderabad, but in vain. It takes a month to make this. It takes a lot of hard work to make these complicated designs. That's why no one is making them. What's that called? The art of weaving. Weaving these special intricate designs. That's the weft. Later, it's woven onto the loom. We wrap the thread around 9000 times a day. In doing so, my mother's bones have worn away. I am making this machine to help her. I'm moved by your story. I bet you love your mother very much. Good job. From now on, this lathe machine is yours during my poetry sessions. I will help you as much as I can. I promise! Wrapped in a cloth of silk In a cradle of diamonds Swing away, my angel Padma! In a cradle of diamonds Padma! I bought you something special. You're bringing all kinds of flowers. But when are you bringing me some jasmines? You are very happy. Yes! I met a guy called Abdul. He's owns a lathe machine. I can work on it. What are you waiting for? Get started. He's allowed me to work for an hour every night. But we have to pay him 350 rupees every month. That's going to be tough on us. It's okay, my dear. I've taken up some stitching job. I'll learn how to stitch blouses to make more money. It will be hard to send money home until we're done. Hey! Look at your dad. Oh, sweetie! He's working. It's time for my poetry! Get ready! All of Hyderabad is going to be steady! Wow! Well said! I've been watching you for two months. You have been wasting time and money. This is the job of an engineer. No. Whatever it takes... I have to build this machine. -Here's your rent. -I don't need it. Keep it for yourself. You have spent a lot on your materials. Get done with building the machine. You can pay me later. We will get through, somehow. But I wonder how our son is doing. He must be struggling to get by. Congratulations! You built the machine! No, bro. The actual work starts now. I built the same wooden model using metal. The actual challenge starts now, and I need your blessing. You've gotten better with your words! It's all because of you. The volcanic eruptions Are countless The calm ocean hides them in its belly The invisible glitches in the blue skies Are infinite Billions of celestial bodies died For the birth of the earth Millions of years of human evolution Led to this human form Countless dreams of the future hover On the sleepy eyes of the infants Many unwritten poems are wailing Inside the wounded heart of a poet Bring our daughter here. She should switch it on. As of now we're just using 12 spindles. And it rotates around the spindle only once. This helps in making small designs. But we need about 40 spindles to make big, elaborate designs. Each spindle needs to rotate around seven times. And that's possible only if we have about four hundred of these strips. But we don't have space to place that many strips. Sweetheart. What do I do now? Consult someone who is an expert in it. He will help you find a solution. I'm the one who is building the machine. But it's only half done. I don't know what else to do. I need some help from someone who is educated. Our education is useless. We just memorize old question papers to pass the exams. You need someone with practical knowledge. Let's ask my professor. Let's go. It's a good design. But it's going to be really hard to make it. I did, sir. I've made it, sir. You made it? -Did you? -Yes, sir. How can I help you? It's using only 12 spindles right now and it only rotates once around the spindle. But for intricate designs, we need more spindles that could make more rotations. I was hoping for a solution from you. There are two variables in what you just said. That is why the mechanical version isn't possible. I mean, we can't execute it. We can try the electronic version of it. But, you'll need... a micro controller... transistors and... How much will it cost, sir? Approximately 30,000 rupees. 30,000 rupees? Please ask him if he will continue with this madness or get back to his senses. Maybe it's Mr. Yadagiri Narasimha Swamy. Dear spirit, you have to answer me. Will he ever come back to his senses? Will he? They say he won't. I've done this so many times but it's never been this disappointing. -See you later. -See you. Uncle. Uncle? What are you doing? I came here to find some labor work. All the looms have shut down in our village. How is Aunt's health? It's become worse. She has stopped weaving. So I'm out here, hoping to earn a living. We can blame it on our fate. That's it. We can blame it on our fate. Bro. The gear is not working properly. Mallesham, where are you going? -Wow! -Thank you-- Abdul. Bro. The engineering professor said that it can't be done. But it can be done. We don't need 400 strips. A big gear for the 40 spindles. A small gear to rotate around the spindles 10 or 20 times. A big gear, a small gear. I don't understand this. How do I explain? Hey, please hand me that clock. Bro. Look at the gear that controls the hours. Here's the gear that controls minutes. -That's about it -Okay, just do it. Take it. Padma. Look who's home. It's Dad! Guess what I've got for you. I'm sure it's not jasmine flowers. Oh, come on! Come on, keep guessing. Sweets! He's got something for you. Padma, it's New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate. I'll fix the small gear. My dear... Yes? What is it, Padma? Why is it rotating in a circle? It's supposed to rotate in the shape of the number eight. -The number eight? -Yes. You don't know how to weave. That is why you don't know what I mean. It's supposed to rotate in the shape of the number eight. What do you mean? I mean... Look at this. It's circular. We have a very fast way of weaving. That is why you've never noticed it. We rotate it like this. This is how we do it. How? It's working, right? Look at this. It's circular... It should rotate like this. Look. It's going back and forth, right? This is all good, my dear. But it's supposed to rotate in the shape of the number eight. I thought I did it correctly. Everyone is very happy. I don't want you to be upset. I've watched women weave ever since I was a kid. But I never noticed that. Don't be sad, my dear. You've achieved so much already. You'll fix this as well. There are only 14 days before the deadline, Padma. How can I finish it by then? It's okay. Take more time. I've promised you. I won't let you down. Dear, I am not asking you take extra time. You spent six months looking after me when I was pregnant. I'm just asking you to make up for it. What's the use of building the machine if I can't keep my word? "Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will visit Pakistan." "A weaver commits suicide." These people just kill themselves to get compensation. Would they have that much money if they were alive? I have an amazing offer for you. I'll pay you two lakh rupees. Why don't you drink this and kill yourself? What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy? I hired you and you're planning to kill me! What are you looking at? Drag him out of here. Do the suicides seem funny to you? We're starving to death and you make it all about the money. How dare you fire me? It's okay, my dear. Take a break. Can't you hear her cry? Why couldn't you hold her for some time? You're just saying this because I'm jobless. That's not what I meant. You just said it. Don't deny it! Are you trying to outsmart me? Why are you dismantling it? I'll sell this off to a scrap dealer. You slipped out of my hands When I almost had you I thought you would guide me But you broke our bond I nurtured you For seven years I treasured you in my heart I protected you Like my own child I fed you With my blood and tears I made a mistake, Padma. I've been very mean to you. I shouldn't have lost my cool. My dear... You have worked hard on the machine for so long. How could you just throw it all away? Go in the morning and get it back. Listen to me, my dear. No, Padma... The machine creates problems. The machine is also a solution to all our problems. Over the past seven years, I've been struggling with the machine. I'm ready to accept this challenge. But this might not be the last challenge. There might be many more problems that might arise. And we don't have enough time, Padma. Please lie down for a while. It's been two days since you had a good night's rest. To solve many people's problems I gave birth to you Instead of being a savior You further increased my burden Like the umbilical cord We were bonded by the thread Like the umbilical cord We were bonded by the thread You turned what could have been A beautifully woven sari into rags Dear, go get the machine back. Why are you being so stubborn? Forget about it, Padma. Why are you bringing it up again? Let me see that. -See what? -The bobbin. Sir! Where's all my stuff? -Your stuff? -Yes. Where is it? -I sold that stuff. -Who did you sell it to? Who did you sell it to? I sold it to a man. Did you notice a scrap cart pass by? I don't think so. Bro. He went that way. This is my stuff. Mallesham. Have you been working all night? Mallesham has built the machine! Everybody needs to come and see it. Yeah, right! Back then, he almost killed me with the fan. I wonder what he's planning to do with this new machine. -Is the baby sleeping? -Yes. The machine is here! -Move aside! -Here... Turn it this way. Get out of the way! What is Mallesham up to? We have no clue what that machine will do to us! Anji, why don't you stand far away from that machine? Grandma, stop it! His machine won't work. I bet a thousand rupees! Does anyone have the courage to bet? I will! He doesn't have money to eat, but he's ready to gamble. I'll bet my house. Mom, please come and switch it on. Dip it in the lake! It's of no use! It's not going to happen today, let's leave. Your house is mine now. Wait a minute. If this machine doesn't work by sunset, you can have my house. I can only hope his fate will change today. Raju. The clutch plate is not working. Get me your old motor. -Sure. -Make it quick. Go quickly! Everybody, move out of the way. Here... Mom. Please switch it on. Wow! Hail, Mallesham! Didn't I tell you the machine would work? Look at the machine working well! Why are you here? Go and take a look at it. I don't deserve to be there. I've been very mean to him. How can I face him? He is our son. And you said all of that for his own good. Come on. Dad. The machine... Mallesham, you made this machine for your mother. Will you help us as well? I will make one for everyone. Baby! Your mother is here. Are the arrangements done? Hello. My name is Chinthakindi Mallesham. I am from Saradhipeta village in Nalgonda district of Telangana state. They said, "For 50 years, our struggle has been going on. The hands of our women are worn out working tirelessly on handlooms and you invented a machine to ease our toil. Thank you. You did this for your mother. Now please consider all the hardworking women weavers here as your mothers and provide us these machines." My parents embraced me and said, "Sorry, son. We were harsh on your ambitions. You invented a machine to ease our labor." In the year 2005, we faced a problem. The price to make the machine was 13,000 rupees. But the price of steel in the market had almost doubled. Many couldn't afford the price. After coming a long way, we were stuck here. Now people were hesitant to buy it, and we were back to square one. After a lot of thought I ran to the old book stores in Koti, Hyderabad. I bought books related to electronics, integrated circuits, transistors etc. I took them home. I started reading them. I struggled to understand each concept. The books are in English and I don't know the language! Oh, God! Later, I bought myself a dictionary. I listed out unfamiliar words on a page and began understanding the concepts. I struggled for two years and made the machine available for 13,000 rupees. In 2000, I had another idea for new designs. We need new and creative innovations. I gave it a thought. While researching about the process, I was advised to use micro controllers on the machine. Micro controllers? What on earth was that all about? My friend asked me to read those electronic text books again. I brought myself four books on micro controllers. I read each instruction meticulously. Now, I can program assembly languages and create various designs. After the arrival of the machine in weavers' homes many educated girls have been employed successfully. One girl called me and said. "My brother, because of your machine I need not learn weaving anymore." I studied Engineering and I have a job that pays me 40,000 rupees per month. I am extremely grateful!
