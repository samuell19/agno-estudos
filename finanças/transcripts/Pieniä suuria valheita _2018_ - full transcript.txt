It was supposed to be furnished. TIME OUT In organized crime and entertainment business there's no such thing as - a second chance. You're being given one now. We are colleagues, even though this is not like usual priest job. This is Koponen, our verger and in charge of the youth work. More or less your boss. Koponen. - Peltola, Harri. This is your new work site. General maintenance, sprinkling sand, - occasional digging work. Damn, it's cold. The staff knows nothing about your background. These we found. Did Jaatinen tell you to clean up this place? -Yeah. What? - Well, everything is going to the trash. So I guess you can stop cleaning. ...twenty-five, twenty-six - twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine... ...thirty-one, two, three, four... What's going on here? Boys! - Were looking for Erkko's hat. There it is. Oh fuck! - Erkko! Shit, God damn it, Fuck... I'm observing my thoughts and they become words. I observe my words and they become actions. I strive for perfection. There's room for everyone, but no one's there yet. I don't take part in bullying of any kind or cause danger - so that everyone can feel safe in our school - both spiritually and physically. Hey, boys! There are always pupils without friends. You can be one to them and I can be one to you. Erkko, would you still read that final sentence. With a thought. Is it true what they're saying? - What? That you'd seen it with your own eyes. In your previous work place. What did it look like? Like a human? Or like an animal? What? - The devil. Satan. Listen... - Marjatta. Marjatta. You get crazies everywhere. Rumors go around. Especially within congregations. Best not to believe everything you hear. Are you saying Jaatinen is full of shit? Look... My blood values and the rest weren't like they were supposed to. Men of the church, they're human too. I've read my theology too. Or did you think they'd let anyone who can play be a cantor? Dad. - Shit. What a shit. In the afternoon no one's going to drink this. Have you ever used this kind of tank coffee maker? It's pretty simple, you use ready-made portion bags. No need to measure. The water comes straight from the tap. The portion bags are here. The easiest is to use the scissors. You can use the timer if you want - but it's easiest to just come and flick it on. Well done, Teemu! - The losers get to pick up the pucks. Next week we're playing indoors. Look at this. "Erkko". Piss on them. - You piss on them. Hey! Everyone pisses on them. Ahonen. Now he is coming. Check it out. This dude has peed in his pants. Yuck. It's piss all right. Everyone takes a shower. What are these? - Had a little accident. Oh Jesus. You're grown-ups. You as well. Everyone in the showers, now. And take care of that mess before I'm back. You heard! He just sits there. I didn't expect being an assistant in the congregation would be like this. Sometimes you just have to take what you're given. I might have thought of it myself sometime: Drink the Eucharist wine - and sit in the pulpit, calling everyone an asshole. How are you doing right now? How are things with the drink, for instance? Makes you feel like quite the idiot - when you're the last to know what everyone else has known for ages. What's that? -That the wife's screwing the fireman. I Bet that stung. Now, I would recommend to take it very easy, take care of your tasks, - like my old man would say, don't show your face. Right? The cantor lady - went around babbling that I'd seen demons and what not. -Really? Where did she get that from? - I don't know. These believers are the worst. But hey... this doesn't have to be final. They're calling from the school. Kalevi Rongas. Principal. - Harri Peltola. Reijo Taavitsainen, Teemu's father. Harri Peltola. - Taavitsainen. We were already going through things with the boys. They pissed on a pair of underpants and then stuffed them in a backpack. Simo's underpants? Pissed on them? - I didn't piss. Was this after the fight? - No, no... Teemu found his underwear in his backpack, and that's when he lost it. A plaster like that can be a lethal weapon. Kale, I'm going to have to... - Of course, we're done here. What did we just agree on? Simo will stay for detention. But we could exchange a few words. Our school has an a zero tolerance policy. -As did his previous school. Iunderstand you had similar situations there. Some boy had had their earlobe torn... That wasn't Simo's fault. - And the plaster... He was bullied because of me, I'm sure you know my background. -Yes. Looks like quite a few people do around here. Look, maybe history doesn't need to repeat itself. I need to talk to Simo. This isn't because of me, is it? - No. So what is it? What did this Teemu do? Simo? - Nothing. Are you telling the truth? -He was the one who pissed on the underwear. On his own pants? - They were Erkko's. Alright, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. These aren't Teemu's pants. We wouldn't have ended up here if I had just kept my mouth shut. What? - Just look. Here we are. And what for? Isn't that so? Well, why didn't you keep your mouth shut? -About mom and...? Because I didn't want to lie. Don't ever apologise for telling the truth. It's who we are. You tell me the truth and I tell you. Isn't that right? Morning. Morning. Is your name Harri? - Yes, or rather Harry. Like Hari? No, it's Harry. Ends with a "y". I'll just call you Peltola. You can call me Koponen. Koponen. - That's right. Koponen. - Yeah yeah. Let's take a break. Father. Look at you. You forgot. So I did. I'd die of hunger if it weren't for you. Peltola. Here's a set of keys for the job. With these you can enter all the municipal properties. Look who's here. Simo. You're supposed to go to the principles office. Oh snap! "Pay attention to my thoughts as they become words, - I pay attention to my words as they become actions. I strive through perfection. There is room for everyone, yet there is no one. Twill not take part in any form of bullying or cause any danger - 50 that everyone can feel safe - both spiritually and physically.? Hello. Long day? What is it? Evening, I came to see your father. Get that dog away from the sofa! God damn it! That's that. Many weeks work. - That's not the end of it. Ice-age. No talking or touching. The food should be given without eye contact... Act as if she didn't exist. It's supposed to mean something. Dad, can I go out? Mom? Going to school has been difficult... But let's talk about Teemu. It's a sensitive time for the boys. Or why not for the girls too. As Reijo said, it was the same before, - there's always been issues. But what can you do, you cant lock them in. Please, have a bun. Last season we got a three match ban. It's when you're physically ahead of the rest and train actively, - it gets difficult to measure your own strength. That's the trouble with the youth: they develop so unevenly. Put the volume down. He grew almost twenty centimeters last autumn. Eats like a horse. Going to the States in the summer. Will you turn the volume down... Oh stop it! - Calm down. Comes here and starts lecturing us. - Who? Him. - We're just talking. Well, ask him what our Teemu's supposed to have done. Well? -At school, this boy Erkko's underpants were pissed on. Erkko's? - That's right. I Bet it was Janne Himelainen. Crazy kid. Got fined for stealing a moped. We've told Teemu to stay away from him. But what can you do, you cant lock them up. Apparently Teemu was involved. Our Teemu? - That's right. We don't know about Erkko's underpants... We've been trying to write his name on things so he wouldn't lose stuff. Hat goes missing almost every day. Other unfortunate things have been done too. To Erkko among others. What things? - That's what we should figure out - and also who is doing it. - No need to raise your voice. I Understand that you're worried. It's not good for the children to get away with things. We've got limited means. But let's do it. Let's solve this. Good. Then the authorities won't have to. Who knows, we might find Erkko's woolly hats while we're at it. I heard there's been some trouble over at the school. Well, it's a small town, rumours tend to spread. Kale Rongas, the principal, my son-in-law - mentioned about this. Isaid you should try and sort these things out by yourself. Sometimes things just get worse when you start digging. We have to move forward. We're all cooking in the same stew. The Taavitsainen lady I've known since she was a child. There have been good times and bad times, weddings and funerals. Everything in between... Maybe now's a good time to take a time out and clam down? Will things improve by not doing anything? Rongas said you'd threatened with the nigger. Raised your voice. -Well, it might have happened as I lost my temper. That's just it. Well, got out already? - Yes. Is everything all right? ?Yes. This is Simo, my son. Koponen. The ice-rink needs to be fixed! - What? On Monday! Let's take a visit here. Hello, how can I help...? - Looking for a TV. What is it now? Hi. Leave her alone. Don't even look at her. That's a thousand Euros. The cheaper models are on the next shelf. We'll take this one. - Dad! We don't accept that. - What? We don't accept that card. Who wants to watch TV anyway. Nothing but repeats and reality TV. - And cooking. Yeah. High five! Bye, nice to see you. If there's anything, with Erkko or otherwise, you can get in touch. Thank you. Hi. - This was nice. This is what the congregation should be like. Don't you think? -Yes. Do you have any hobbies? - Judo. Caring and taking care. Even our Erkko has been going to school almost happy. -That's good. Excuse me for a second... We've been thinking that we could increase the activities... Peltola, don't you have anything else to do? -Yes, that's right. The ice rink should be ready tomorrow. Today we're playing the inter-school provincial ice-hockey finals. The winner will get to participate in the national tournament in Espoo. Finally an announcement. The teachers will hand out a questionnaire - which everyone will fill out according to their conscience. The questionnaires are to be returned before today's match. What does this Teemu 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Simo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mean? If you think that Teemu is to blame - you should tick 5. If you think he is fairly guilty, tick 4 and so forth. Number one means you think Teemu is pretty much not guilty. Then the same with Simo. So just tick number 1 for Teemu. And why is there the same question twice? The first question asks who was more to blame - according to what you saw - and the other according to what you heard. Should we have considered the timing a little bit? This'll make it difficult to focus on the game. What happened during that lesson? - How could I know. They're twenty boys and maybe three of them have any physical capabilities. Do I have to guard them like in the kindergarten? All right, don't get upset. Don't you have a lesson to go to? If we lose this match, it's on you. Koponen. - Yes? We need a new batch of Malaga. Already? - It's been some time. It'll take me until the evening. I can't leave the old man alone. I wouldn't want to start watering down what we have. Hey guys, get your kit on! The other team's been warming up for some time. Hey teacher, can I give this to you? Give me the questionnaires. Let's concentrate on the game. This isn't realty a job for the medic. All right, break a leg boys. All right boys, lets go. Teemu, get your skates on. Not a valley, not a hill - no water or shore more dear, - than this our country in the north, land of our fathers. Thank you Marjatta and the Harmaaketo mixed choir. The puck will be dropped by a supporter of our team - and vice-member of our parental organization, Reijo Taavitsainen. Was the song a bit too much? - Just good. Fair game, right boys? Hey! There was nothing! For fuck's sake. Fucking hell! They were alright, but... Should've fore-checked the opponent earlier. The front was too wide. That's just... The real reason is something else. The boys were filling out these when the game was about to start. No way. God damn it. What? - It's your fault we lost. I didn't even play. What the hell? What's this? -The dude was pushing Erkko. Everyone saw it! Oh fuck, shit, fuck...! What the hell is going on here? Are you feeling bad? - A little. Sit there. Press with that. I'll take your shoes off. This isn't one of the Taavitsainen boys ideas? Teemu. Total asshole... like his father. When's your father coming? I don't know but I'll be fine. It could be a concussion. We can't leave you by yourself. Are we in a hurry? - No, why so? If I take all of them since I can't remember which one it was. -Sure. How about the old coffee machine, should I take it with me? -Go ahead. How is it? - Nothing special. Go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning. How about you? Small surface renovation. What's your flat like? It's all right. Light. Come and see it some day. - Sure. How's Simo? - Good. Good. He's found a lot of friends and school is going nicely. He didn't want to come? - No. Well, there was some work to be done... Peltola. The old man needs to go for a shit. Needs to go for a shit. When are you getting rid of that? - Next month. Itchy? Can you move your fingers? I had my leg in plaster all through the summer when I was a kid. All my friends wanted to write their names on it. It was pretty stupid-looking. Nice person. Do you want to talk? It's tough. When you've trusted, opened up, given your all And all of a sudden - it's gone, You're looking at the back-lights of a bus, - wondering what happened. What day is it, what year - what planet? Who am I? No matter how much you take the other person or woman into consideration. Listen to them talk about their childhood. Somebody shows up at your home - and demands your house, your wife, your kids - and everything you've ever dreamed of: that Sunday is Sunday that the lake is not the ocean. Where are we going? - Here for instance. People... You look for comfort from - where you can get it. Is there anything to calm you like Finnish nature? Birgitta! Helped. You need proper equipment. It's like you're living in the middle ages. Here goes. I Wish... that all the crap that has been said from this pulpit - would be true... Because in that case - all of you cowards would go straight to hell He's out of his mind. - No wonder the kid is having issues. And now you're showing this? Our confidentiality is pretty strict. Why on earth would you hire someone like that? Can't you fire him? - It's not that simple. Something needs to be done. - Well, that's why were here. Hey. School nurse, Tuula Lehtonen. You're Simo's father. I Stayed just in case but he seems fine. Don't you think? Yes. There was some... Or maybe Simo can tell you himself. It's good to keep an eye on it. I don't think there's anything there. It would have showed itself by now. He's a good boy. It's just those few rotten apples, pricks. If I may say so. Good night. Tuula fixed it. It was a connection fault. You can't get control one bloody misfit. My boy's at home concussed - and you won't do anything, just prancing around in your slippers. What are you talking about? - Simo, my son. Our nurse called - and I will ask the parties involved to come in for a meeting. -Good. We'll sort this thing out properly. That's what you want, right? My Simo tells the truth. - But what if everyone does? There's 151 answers here. Each one: Teemu, one. Simo, five. That doesn't prove anything. They've all been scared. What else should I do? Are you asking me? I'm going to have to contact a third party that is willing to help. Good. The end result might not be all too good for you. The social services have their own principles. At least someone does. Peltola! One more thing. My father's gravestone is a bit wonky. The congregation has been notified many times. Could you fix it? Don't feed the dog. I have to be so ashamed of you. All of you. What have I done? - Ha! Now that everyone's gathered, I have something to say. You have that new fellow in your class. That's right. It pisses me off, going over the same thing at school, again and again. I Don't fucking know anything about it. -Watch it. What? Always me. Watch it! The father of that family might not be the only nutcase... These things get passed on, father to son. Due to this, in order to be safe, our family - will not recognize the existence of the Peltola family. No need to walk into them but all kind of fraternizing is forbidden. You can't be serious. We have to act consistently. This is to test how mature you can be. To see if we can send you abroad or not. Let alone the States. Isn't that tantamount to... At least I'm going there. -We'll see. One of you might go, or neither one. They have language courses here as well. We are going for zero tolerance. Any complaints - and you can forget about traveling. Goes for both of you. And I hope we don't have to talk about this again. But what if...? Sorry. Hi. This is the sequel to the one you've got. Teemu, look. Fix those lights so I don't have to call the nigger. Simo! What is it? Aren't you supposed to be in school? Simo! - What? Come into the car. Did that Teemu do anything? - No. So what is it? - Nothing. Nobody did anything. If this feels impossible to you, - we don't have to stay here. There's no shame in having to admit that things - didn't work out. So where would we go? To Liberia, I don't know. No, this is all right. Are you sure, because... - I'm sure. You'll be fine? - I'll be fine. Then we'll both be fine, Do you want to go back? - Sure. Not a problem. You're a good boy. You know that? I'll drop you off. You know Rongas pretty well. Maybe it would help if you talked to him. Maybe it could help him see things from my perspective. Our perspective, Simo's. We don't wish any ill on anyone. Still everything seems to go up shit creek. I Wonder why? There's three ways for a person to define themselves: What they are, what they're not and what they would like to be. The most important one is the first one. The other two complete it. Actually I think they're one and the same thing. Let me see your bag. What? There's a thermos flask full of coffee taken from the congregation. God damn it. We have a strict zero tolerance rule regarding these things. I'm not going to any fucking discussion. I Haven't even done anything. - Don't we have to? My old man's going to kill me. I swear. Erkko was the one who pushed him. Makes no sense. This is enough. You'll get an invitation - and we'll discuss things through together. You can wipe your ass with the invitation. It's all just theatre, decided in advance. Harri! Look around you. What do you see? - You'd better let go of me. They're children. Some of them close to two meters tall - but they're children. What are we? Tell me. Well, you're an asshole. And we're getting out of here. - We are adults... Teemu? Simo! Taavitsainen! He's not here at the moment. Come out if there's a man in you! God damn it! Goddamn coward! I'll stuff this stick up your ass! Do you want me to let the dogs out!? Hey! Stop! Come back! God dammit! What are you doing here? Marko drove me here. You said everything was fine when you visited. -That's what people say. Peltola. Icaught Teemu. Now don't get upset but he said it was an accident. The door had jammed shut and as Simo tried to - climb over it, he... ...he fell down. You're a bunch of bloody inbreds, the whole town. Simo Peltola's parents? Look at you... Where am I? - In the hospital. You got quite a bump but nothing serious. What happened? - Teemu came and... ran like a coward. - Why? I Swear the boy's going to answer for this. You won't have to be afraid of anything. Simo's clothes can be found here on the shelf. How about all the school gear? Backpack and things... There's nothing here but a jacket and a pair of trousers. How about the backpack? And the mobile phone? -Sirpa. Was it in your backpack - I can't remember. Could it have been left there in the toilets? -What's the difference? Of course there's a difference. - Maybe we should let the boy rest. Are you feeling bad? - I'm tired. Try and have a little nap. I'll be right back. Hell make us all responsible for this. The congregation has acted according to procedure. You didn't see the boy. It'll make big noise. And I called the social services. Well, that'll save Peltola the trouble... Now that God damned idiot has finally lost it! I Doubt they'll make dogs any more... - All right! Stop this nonsense. We've been cleaning up after your boy's mess. But enough is enough. - Come on guys... Aren't you aware? - Haven't you been told? I'll call you. Why did you do it? Did you hear me Teemu? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? - I didn't do it! I didn't even touch him. How hard is it for you to understand? But you ran away? Did he fuck with you? What did he do? I just wanted to make peace. - Why? The States. If you want you can take the boy with you. Let him think about what he's done over the night. It's pretty rough. - The world is a rough place. How about Peltola? What's going to happen with him? Which one? - The lunatic. Lets take one thing at a time. Are you tired? - A little. Are you in a lot of pain? Just a little. It'll get better. Your mom asked you to call her when you can. Hello. Are we awake yet? This is Senior Constable Markkanen - and Saija Moisio, the municipal social worker. Seija. - That's right. Markkanen. Are you OK to talk? It would be good if you could. Can you? - I guess so. If you would allow me? Simo, could you tell us - what happened? I Don't think Simo remembers. Simo, you can tell us the truth. Can't we do this unofficially...? - You better tell the truth. I Remember going in there... In where? - The toilet. But... Did the door jam somehow? - What? A little sympathy, please. He can't remember. We could go visit the spot. Let's do that. - We can talk later. Dad. - Yes? Was my backpack there in the toilet? - No... or I haven't checked yet. But I'll do it now. - OK. That's the one. Is it good? ?Yes. You sure? - Yes I'm sure. I'll go and see what the situation is. What actually happened? You talked? Who was there? I want also! Simo. Simo... Get well soon. I'm sorry. Harri. Dad. - Yes? I remember. - What? I remember. Last time we spoke you didn't quite remember what happened in the toilet. Do you remember now? Well... yes. I Remember locking the door. What happened then? Did something happen? You have to fucking remember...! - Teemu. You couldn't open the door and you started climbing... You'll speak when you're spoken to. - Right. Anything else? No. How about the fathers? Harri. Any comments or demands? No. Nothing. Peltola, would you come over for a while. That went like it should. Here. You're welcome. LIAR Merry Christmas. From the entire congregation. What we have here... We have a Christmas tree. Dad. - What? Are you asleep? - No. What if Teemu spoke the truth? What? - If things went the way he said? Why are you thinking like that? It's the night before Christmas. But what if? Simo, it's over. Everyone got what they deserved. Even though that event wouldn't have gone exactly the way it did. Everything's better now. It would have never ended otherwise. It was about everything else as well. Everything's connected. No point speculating. It's over. Are you there? Let's sleep now. Good night. Would you like some gingerbread? - Thank you. All I'm saying is - a swede stew's a swede stew. It's like you're talking to some little kid or a retard. Simo... That's not what I'm saying. Should I get us a pizza? Simo? Let's go get in the car. Hello. - Hello. Good. Lets go to the car... What is this? We're moving to Helsinki. Or Kerava. Pretty much the same thing. Isn't that going a bit too far? - What? Is it because of these earlier...? Is it because of me? No. Don't think too much of yourself. I got a job at Gigantti in Kerava. The pay is OK, less stress. The wife and kids have a chance to get away from these banjo players. These what? Peltola. I've been completely out of it. Finally it feels as though things - are going in the right direction. We're talking again and doing things together. We're a family again. The boy's carried his load like a man. It's good he takes responsibility for his actions. -Reijo. Your son is telling the truth. - I know that. Good. And so is mine. Myself, I'm not so sure about. Peltola, the only way is forward. Let's go. Simo. Knock, knock, can you hear me? Is everything OK? Can't we just act normal, the way we've always been. We could talk. I don't know if this helps, but I... ...bought you a new phone. I'll place it here behind the door. And then there's the pizza. I just wanted to talk about what we said - about always telling the truth. I Feel like it was quite a lot to promise. Especially from a grown up man like me. Nobody can do it. At least I cant. Maybe someone can, I don't know. It's a good principle, don't get me wrong. But principles are never easy. You can easily find yourself tied up in a knot. In the end you're just a lump. That thinks: This is how it should be. This is what life is like. And it's not. But at least I won't become a smart-ass - if you happen to fall over. I'll wait next to you until you get up. Or I'll help you. Or I'll become a smart-ass. Better not promise too much. At least I've learned that. That's what I was calling about. Nothing else. I Just wanted to talk about what we said about always telling the truth. Koponen! Where the hell is Peltola? Outside. God damn it. My stole! Get up from there.
