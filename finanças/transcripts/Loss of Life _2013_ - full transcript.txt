The girls Anthony said he got. And then people who just hear it from word of mouth, so like regardless of anything, it should aight. You know what the crazy thing about that is? It's my birthday. - So it's going to be fun without it, right? It's like 10 times better. - In this little Joey Show that we have, we have performers, we have, you know, the things you'll want to see, like people get hurt, money, cars, girls, and losers, like these guys. So, hey, yo. - I got the truck, too. I get to keep them if I want to. - Welcome to the Joey Show. - Are they calling you right now? - Hello? - Come here. I'm trying to get a lap dance from all the females. I mean, the seniors is at the high school, too. I know I just turned 17 and all, but I mean, like, I'm basically grown now, right? - Yeah, you grown. I got a full Adam's apple, so I feel like, in my book, I'm grown. - Can you have like an Adam's apple? - What you mean? - Was that Kristen? - Yeah, it's Kristen. You know, Anthony's sister. Our first performer, Nick. - What are you talking about? It's the Joey Show, man. - The fucking Joey Show. - Come on. You always think I'm playin'. Like-- yo, chill, man.

Seriously, I really do care about you. Like, for real. - What are you talkin' about? - You know how long ago that was? Like, for real. Like, come on. That's childish. Like-- - Come on, man. It's childish. - I promise you, though. - Once you start making promises to a girl, that's when it's over. Your fifth grade class didn't teach you about electricity? - Don't question me. I got a 98 in science. Thank you. Don't try me. - Bam. Hey, those things is bright, for sure. Hey. This is really going to work. - This dude's in love, man. - I promise. He just did it. - We good?

Hopefully I can get like the water flying from under my board, make it look all cool. - Yeah, for sure. Hey. Well, let's do this little interview. Yo. - What interview? Cause, like, you always behind the camera, so I just feel like we need to interview you. It's the school project, so they need to see, like-- you know, it's behind the scenes. - So you see what I do and you want to do it, huh? I feel-- I'm-- - No, I'm just trying to get this interview. I just want your thing to be legit. - Tre just like your face a lot. - I feel you. - Eh, shut up. - You've got some questions for me? OK, yeah. All right.

Dude. - She ain't the most gorgeous girl in the world. - Bro, she is beautiful, man. - You tell her you love her, bro. - I do love her. That's my baby. - You call him baby? Joe, get the fuck out of here, man. - Give us a serious answer. - All right. This might sound crazy, right? But you know how when you see stuff, you can just-- you see stuff through your eyes, right? - Yes. - Shut up. I'm serious. Like, you see stuff through your eyes, but you can't see through other people's eyes. Like, it makes sense in my head. It might not sound right when I say it. But when I film stuff, it's like-- it gives other people a chance to see what I see through my eyes, or through my lens. So it's like, it's an opportunity to give the world not only a chance to see something form a different perspective, but, like, from my perspective. Perspective. It's like living through other people's lives, like life in different angles. - I guess, yeah. - Well, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That was cool. That was cool. You expect that answer, Tre? - I swear to god. She is-- I want to marry her. She's everything, bro. - I had a couple girls I wanted to marry. - No, but like, you know how like some dudes might act like they ain't got no feelings for a girl? But like, I swear to god. I got feelings for her, like, I will tell her I love her. Like, I love her, man. - You'll tell her you love her. - Like if you love somebody, you should tell them you love them. - How tall I am or something? - All right. Let us know who gave you a camera? Like, where'd you get it from? - Like the camera that Joey's got now? That camera? - Yeah. The one that he shouldn't be holding. - Um-- look at him though. He better not break my camera. But, um, my dad gave it to me before he left. Before he left? Where? Where'd he go, to the Army? - Nah, he just left, man. It was cool. It ain't no big deal. - Word. Hey Joey, what the fuck is you recording for? - Yo, man. - Ain't that Derrick's camera? Y'all on the Joey Show, remember? You're all my new performers? - The Joey Show? You're all my new performers? The Joey Show? - You just performed a little something-something. You just performed a little something-something. - That's D's camera. - Huh? - You performing?

She a good girl, I think. - I just don't know how to talk to girls. Oh. - Aww. - You got it? - I got it. - You got it? Aight. Welcome to the Joey Show, ladies and gentlemen. The Joey Show. - And in the Joey Show, we have performers and, you know, things that y'all want to see-- real people. - I like that light. - Like me and your brother Nick. - Like myself. So, hold on. - Yeah, exactly. - Tell the people who your first performer is going to be tonight. - So, oh, yeah. So to start the show off, we're going to have our first performer, Nick. - Oh, me? - Yeah, Nick. You. - Oh, I didn't know. - And you gotta show them your, uh, special talent, you know, because that's what it's about, performance. - All right. Let me go get my prop. - What's so hard about it? Like, talk to her like you talk to us. - It's just-- she's just so pretty, you know? All right, man. Look. - I mean, you all ugly, so. - How you do chicks, right? - You don't just go up to them from behind and, you know, grab them and be like yeah. Then it's going to turn around and give you this face. All right. Check this out-- - You can't. - No. But look, look, look. When talking to females, you just have to be comfortable. You got to be confident. Because for some reason, girls have a sense-- like, they just know when you're not comfortable. They can see it on your face. So if you're not, they're going to feel weird with you now, because that's just going to put them in an awkward situation. You know? So if you come at her, you like, you know, you confident, you got good conversation, then she going to like that, because you're not going to be the average dude, you know? - All right, so look. Skateboard, right? - So show me what you got here. - I got you, Nick. I got you. - You know how all skateboarders like, do tricks? I don't do tricks, you know what I'm saying? - You don't skateboard. - I make movies. - Oh, you make movies. - I make movies. When you look at me skateboarding, it's like, wow, he just really did that. Like, watch. All right-- don't even get me. Like, get my feet. - He about to do a trick now. - Yeah, get my feet.

Yo, yo. - The water hit the front wheel. - Next performer, moving on. Anyway, I'm going to show you all my talent. - But y'all don't appreciate it. - You read that on a book? Like, you read that? No. I'm just a smooth operator. That's what I am. - Look, man. It's simple, right? You know how you say she pretty. Just don't take it her like that. Don't treat her like, oh, so pretty, because everybody do it because she's pretty. Just treat her like a regular girl. It's going to catch her off guard, and she gonna be like, intrigued. You know what I mean/ - I'm going to show you my hidden talent, boy. What's your talent? - Imma spit. - You're going to to spit. - Imma spit fire. You the new Eminem? - And-- and you gonna feel higher. What? My moves? You wanna see my moves? You don't want to see my moves. - Come on, yo. - You don't want to see my moves. You want to see my moves? Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to witness, Joe. Uh! Wow! No. It's too much. It's too much. What's that with the sound effects? - Like fire. That's what I'm tripping off of, the sound effects. - Well, because, dude, people don't make sound effects when they dance, so I'm original. So I'm original. There's a reason why they don't make sound effects when they dance. - Why not? You got your little religion thing going on and everything, but I feel like, you know, like, stick with that, stay strong with that. And if she can't respect that, then obviously she ain't the right one for you. But, I mean-- Kind of like these fools. Yeah, for real. Seriously. - Aww.

Just repeat your name. - Billy Craps. Why are we - Because Erica Shaw took something from me. What did she - My sisters. And the courts just let her go free. But mate, it's possible other people will be involved tonight, Billy. Are you prepared for that? Tell them. - My name is Rick Craps. I'm Billy's uncle. And I guess this is what you call confession. We're outside of Shaw's. And tonight, we're going to kill Erica Shaw. We have waited two years for the court systems to serve us justice. Meanwhile, she walks free. My nephew Billy called me last night and described the emptiness in his heart. And it will never go away. It's the same emptiness I feel. What we're about to do is not our fault. The court systems failed us. So you clean up the mess.
