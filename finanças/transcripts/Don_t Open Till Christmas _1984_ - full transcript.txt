Sorry I'm late time. Get away, go on! Clear off! Forget about him. What the hell is going on? Get out there. Go on! Fuck off! No! DON'T OPEN TILL CHRISTMAS Imposing sentence upon you... - Daddy, we're on? - Oh. How do I look? Well, too much rouge. Not enough eyebrows. I'll do it. I should look like a gay old queen. Let's get this down on the road, folks. Take that perfectly awful? thing off. Well, how are we doing? Are you ready? What do you think? Hmm! Looks like a gay old queen to me. That's a great help. You shouldn't worry about it though it's turning into an orgy out there. You're sure is located? Watch out for the guy who's come as a shrunken head. Real gruesome. Looking putting people off their food. Do you mind this is an integral part of my act. Right. I'm going to introduce you. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could just have your attention for a few moments. The time has come to introduce our special guest for the evening. - Flown in all the way from... - Greenland on his flying reindeer... Santa Claus! I'm come not empty-handed. Sure not. And with gifts for you all. The only trouble is I can't read the labels. Oh, Daddy! God! Thanks very much Sid, cheerio. Come on, lads, the boss is on his way up. You know it makes him?nervous to see his picture in the papers. Come on, get these things out of the way. - Good morning, pal. - Good morning. Good morning you two. What?are you doing here? Oh. I see, give me that. Only three more killing days to Christmas. The chief's gonna love cracks like that. Clear off you two. I'm afraid the assistant commissioner's breathing down our necks. Oh! I want to see the girl and that boy. Uh, the boy, uh, answered the phone and I rang her up this morning said. I said we'd be over. I thought it'd be better that way, because she's in no state to come to the Yard. I suppose you're right. Have you checked the boy out? Yes, sir, Cliff Boyd. Cheeky young bugger. No record. Good family. Dropout. Nothing violent. - And the girl's father? - Oh, rich! rich! Everybody loved him. And of course, the girl gets the money. Well, that'll be a nice catch if the boy can land it. Pretty girl, no? Let's go. Oh, the boy is here too? Yeah! See, he lives with her. All right. Good morning. How do you do inspector? Won't you come in? I'm most grateful to you, Miss. Briosky. Especially after the... uh... well... My father had no enemies. We know that, Miss Briosky. We know that. Well inspector, you've got your first clue. The one I gave you last night, this drunken head. I'm afraid we don't have very many clues, Miss. There were no fingerprints on it. It was the costume that he was wearing. He was the victim of another Santa murderer. We'll be given early next year, tonight in London the festive atmosphere has a distinct chill about it. As yet another Santa Claus is slain. And now for the weather. Ah! Thank you. Happy Christmas! Oh, inspector Harris, look what's just arrived, by special delivery, Christmas present. And it says don't open till Christmas. - Thank you, Miss Sherry. - You're gonna wait? Yes, why not? Put it on my desk, will you? I've got an awful lot and I can't stop, I'm afraid. Oh what a shame. Terrible about that poor Santa in Soho. Quite so, Mrs. Shelley, quite so. We have all the glory details of the Yard. And the photographs. Well, I'll be seeing you again then on, uh, Wednesday, isn't it? Yes, Christmas eve. Uh,? anything I can get for you? No, I'm afraid that breakfast is the only meal I can be sure of these days. I tell you Mrs Shelby. Christmas is no time to be a policeman. I should be late. Yeah, until, uh, Wednesday. Then goodbye. Goodbye. Pity really. Perhaps you'll show me some of the odd photographs on Wednesday. - Here you are sir. - Thanks Powell. Good morning, pal. Good morning, sir. Oh, that girl's been on against, sir. I told her there was nothing new, but she wants to talk to you. God, I'm tired. I get no sleep these days. Do you think, sir, we might have a psychopath on our hands? Funny thing, Barl, that's exactly what the assistant commissioner was bellowing at me moment ago. I just tore myself away from his office. You know what I replied? As early days yet for a pattern, I suppose. Guess what he answered with that damn superiority of his. Perhaps we can assume. Then but the killings will just stop and give us something to look forward to next Christmas. More trouble is, Sir. The moment anyone puts on a a Santa Claus costume they become a sort of semi-holy figure don't they like well to the kids anyway. The whole of the west end is crammed with Santa Clauses. What have you got on this latest? Oh, petty crook known to West End Central could have been pushing drugs. This one could have been a coincidence, actually. Well, gangland rivalry. Rivalry over what? Chestnut vending pictures. Thank you Powell, that was a good try. I'll call the girl. Of course, inspector. I'll be here. Anything new? - There's been another killing. - Big deal. If it's the chestnut vendor. It's already been in the papers. I haven't read the papers. You haven't called that longer back. My father's just been murdered. I can't concentrate. Yeah, right. Sorry. You have to come back into the real world sometime. Maybe that law's call is important. He did ask one strange question. - Harris. - Yes. It was about you. He asked whether we intended in getting married. Did you know. Yes, I'd like to speak to sergeant Powell, please. - Sergeant Paul. - Yes, my name is Giles, Daily News. Oh, Daily News. So you're the one responsible for these alarmist headlines, are you? Yes, well, some of them. Are you only nearer to solving these dreadful Santa Claus crimes? Well, we're still making our inquiries. It's uh just a matter of time. Which means you haven't a clue who you're looking for. What did you say your name was again, sir? My name is Giles, Giles. All right, Mr. Giles. Well, if you want any more information, the chief inspector Harris will be giving a press conference tomorrow. Look, forget Harris. Tell me. sergeant Powell. Would it help your promotion prospects if you were to solve this case personally? Sorry. I don't understand what are you getting at? Do you have any information, sir? Just think about what I've said. I'll be in touch. Uh, just a minute, sir. Yeah, get me the Daily News, wil you? Kate! - Kate Briosky? - Yes. - My name is Giles, Daily News. - You startled me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Can I ask you some questions? If it's about my father, I've been told not to say anything. Uh, who told you not to say anything? Chief Inspector Harris. Anyway, I don't know what I can tell you that you don't know already. My interest is your personal angle. Are you coping? What your plans are that sort of thing? If you've ever lost a mother or father in unfortunate circumstances, you wouldn't be asking questions like that. - Oh, but I have. - I'm sorry but I have to go now. If there's anything else you want to know you better speak to the police. Hey, Miss Briosky. Merry Christmas. Excuse me, do you do requests? Oh, blimey, by the look of that you need to, eh? - Jerry! - Hey! Where'd you spring from? Well, you know me, mate. Ducking or weaving, ducking or weaving. - Who's the, who's the... - Oh, well yeah this is a friend of mine. Jerry, Kate, Jerry. Oh yeah. I've met you before? Are you uh famous on the TV, ain't? Well, let me tell you both for a drink, eh? I'll see you boys later. I'm getting a newspaper. - What's up? - She was on TV. Her father was killed at the Christmas party. Not in the Christmas party. Oh, Jesus what did I say Jesus Christ. Well, don't worry about it. she's just raw with grief. Well, look Cliff, tell her I'm sorry. Don't worry. So what are you up to? Well, I'm in two uh cameras. - Are you stealing or selling? - Hey, come on. Take me a favor, will you? I'm a photographer now. I've got my own studio they've got everything. Porn? Now would I do a thing like that? So, if you're uh very interested, why don't you put around to the studio sometime? Hey. I've just had a thought why don't you come out tonight. It'd be great. I don't want uh there might be some change in it for you. Especially if you bring the uh pretty blond girl. Say about six? Well nothing, uh, you know... No, just let's say... interested. - Right, you're on. - Yeah, be great. Nice to see you. Oh and get that flute tune before you come there. What did that creep want? Oh, we're invited to tea. - Oh yeah? - Come on, let's go. Come on darling, open it. Good! Lovely! Right. I will just a... Wait now. Wait a minute. We've not finished yet. Now, just a few 35's. What about my coffee break? The coffee is there, hang on. You won't let me get to it, will you? Smile. Lovely. Just minute, stop. I'm freezing. - Just look that. - It can't be. We've got all the lamps on. Look. Right, a couple more, then we'll go outside. - What, like this? - Why not? That's freeze to death, that's why not. That will make you nipples stand up. Besides, the temperature is just the same outside. That's great. Good. Oh. Hi there! - Your timing's perfect. - What does he mean by that? - Well, you did say interesting. - What? Oh that. Oh, that's just a working clothes. Hey, good to you see you. Come in. How are you Kate? - Anyone for coffee. - Yeah, thanks too, Jerry. Hi, Cliff, I'm Sharon. Hi Sharon, I'm delighted. And I'm bloody furious. Would you're in? Sharon is one my favorite models. He have trouble with that, Cliff. If you get used a lot, you lose work. They'd say you're overexposed. Do you find that a problem? You're the other girl that Jerry is telling me about. What other girl? He said we're doing some doubles later. Oh, did he? Look Kate, uh, listen, seems Jerry's got a bit of a problem. He had another couple book for tonight but they call and cancel. Don't look at me like that. He's got some wigs. You can change your appearance. Nobody'll ever know. - It's a quick 50. - Are you out of your mind? Me? Cliff, what's happening to you? - Joey's an old friend. - Well, he's not one of mine. We're here anyway. If you have good body. You wanna put to work. Are you ready then? My God! You're insensitive busters. What have you said to? Did you have to show her this? I ought to ram it down your bloody throat. What I've done now then. Her father, remember? I've must stop doing that. So this book will be with Sharon. - Better I'll go after her. - Why? You wonder yourself any favors with her tonight. Sharon, on the other hand. She's ready and waiting. And afterwards you can help me with the street shots. What street shots? Come on, lover boy. Put your arm round mama keep her warm it's cold outside. Right, uh, maybe we should wait for Jerry. I don't think jerry got a single shot in oh here detail. But I should did. You crazy. They can get arrested us. Oh, your lovely. Oh-oh, they're come. they'll think we're a couple of gays. Christ! And we haven't got any keys. Run for it, beat it! - Don't leave me here. - Well, they've seen us. This is go. I don't understand why you let her go home. Well, when we brought her home last night so I did ask her not to leave the house without letting us know. - She's probably in there. - I hope you're right. Who is it? Detective Inspector Harris Here. Oh, it's you. You can come on in I'm not getting up. I'm in here. Look. I'm losing a lot of work. Just calm down, young lady, you should have spent the night at the station. It was only the unfortunate circumstances of last night that saved you. You were arrested for indecent exposure. Indeed, sir? I'm a professional. You were in public. Now just you calm down and answer a few questions of mine and I'll let you go back to work. - All I saw was the knife. - Knife? I think it was a knife. Might have been a razor. Look, it was bad enough being dumped by Cliff in the middle of the night. At the time of the attack where was he? I don't know. Who do you think your attacker might have been? Oh I don't know, it was so dark. It could have been anybody. For all I know it could have been you. - Didn't you get a look at his face? - He was wearing a mask. Powell, I'm going off. I'll be about an hour. - Yeah but... - Where's he off to in such a hurry? What, oh. Well he's always going off on his own somewhere. Look. I want you to think very carefully. Is there anything that stands out in your mind about the attacker? - Anything at all. - One thing. - Can talk? - His eyes. - They seem to smile. - Yes. Can you remember how tall he was? - Oh, he was quite a big man. - By my height? - Yes, yeah, about your height. - Yes. Okay. Well, you've been very helpful. No, you just stay in bed and rest. I'll see myself out. Pick up the telephone. - You can hear me now? - Yes, I can hear you. Sit down. Oh, yes. So Santa, did you bring me any presents? I'm... I'm not the real one. I just work in the department store down the road. Oh, I thought you were you're. You're very pretty to be working in a place like this. - I'm not really a model. I'm a dancer. - A dancer? Yeah, you want to see? - Is that it? - What do you expect, Flashdance? I didn't know. I didn't know what to expect. It's my first time in this sort of place. - Me too. - Really? You see, I live with my mother. So do I. I don't think my mother would understand. Does your mother know you work here? She ought to. She owns it. - I'm just filling in. - Oh, for another girl? No, for my mother. - Look, can't we... - Yes? Can't we get rid of this glass and then... - What do you know... - Oh, no! That would be breaking the law. Besides, who knows what you might get up to? All those kiddies sitting on your knee all day. I'd love to have you sitting on my knee. Would you? Do you like me on your knee all bouncing and raring to go? Do you like your hands all over me? Caressing me? Oh, yes. If you want to see anymore, cost you another five. What happened? Her boyfriend came back unexpectedly? I've told you. I never saw the girl after the cops came. So you spent all night looking for her. I spent all night looking for that shit Jerry. When I found him. That's how I got this. Oh, yeah! Oh. I suppose this must be her now. Maybe she's looking for you too. Hello, Cliff. What happened to your hand? I came into violent contact with a certain jaw. Hello, inspector. Any news? No. I'm afraid not. Where were you last night, Cliff? - Is that any of your business? - He was with me. Yes. yes, I know he was. Up to the point that you stormed out of that studio. But I'm interested in what he got up to after that. What's happened? Sharon, the model you met last night, was attacked in the street. Attacked? Who would attack her? Maybe you can tell me. You recall how she was dressed Santa Claus. I don't believe it. You took that girl outside dressed in that costume after all that's happened? - You must be mad. - That wasn't my idea. I didn't think that... Wait a minute. I've been on the spot for two of these killings. You're thinking it could have been me. That's ridiculous. What possible reason could I have for going around killing Santas? Oh, none. That we know of. I'll be seeing you around, Cliff. May I come and see you? Of course Miss Briosky you know where my office is. No, I'd like to talk to you somewhere less public. Yes, my private number. There are very few of these out, Miss Briosky. Kate. Uh, you're very welcome Kate, but please, not today. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. Who are you? What are you doing here? Giles, uh, Evening News. Yes, they, uh, said, you'd be in your office. I was just looking for a light. All right, Mr. Giles, what have you got to tell me? - Well, my newspaper... - No newspaper, didn't seem to know where you were in fact they've never even heard of you. Yes, Giles Morgan. I'm sure sergeant MacBain showed me up. Yes. Now you mentioned on the phone that you had some information that might lead me to the murderer. I said would it help your promotion prospects if you were to solve the murders personally. Yes, all right. But you do know something? Your inspector Harris does he tell you everything... that you know what his movements are. You know, generally keep you in the picture. Well, I have a a fair idea of what's going on. Now come on what are you getting at? You should give a better eye on him. Are you suggesting that inspector Harris... No. I'm not suggesting anything. I've got to go. Catch the late edition. You might try tailing him. I might try tailing you. Dennis, this chap has just left my office. Yeah, that's him. Uh, just get one of the boys to follow him for half an hour see where he goes. Let me know, okay. Damn! - Hey, is Santa! - Look! Kick, come on. - Do you want a coffee? - Yeah, yeah, thanks. Funny that. I'm not turning up at the inquest. Don't you think so? - Who are you talking about? - Your detective inspector, Harris. I thought he'd have shown up. Murder by person or person's unknown. Foregone conclusion. I suppose he thought. He thought it wasn't worth coming. To hear what he already knew. Are you obsessed with him or something? What's that supposed to mean obsessed? I only wanted to make a point, that's all. I'm the one that loves you, not him. Well, Sid just get out as many as you can. Yeah! Well, 20, 30, something like that. But let me know how many, all right, thanks a lot. - What do you want Inspector Harris? - Yes, sir. He's on his way down from the dizzy heights of the commissioner's office. And I don't advise you to be around when it all starts hitting the fan. He was in a foul mood when he went up there. Powell, I think this may very well be my last case. You know I think. I'll beat him to it and resign. That... that man up there has issued me with a direct order. Get your men out on the streets. - Decoys. - Yes, sir. I know. I've put the operation into motion just now. - Oh, it's like that is it. - Why has he done it sir? It's so that when the home secretary climbs on his back. You'll have a good answer when he's asked "why don't you do something"? Oh, I'm gonna do something. Good it, Carl. If soldier Paul could see us now. Come on, oh, Mr. Show. All right, all right now then. Which of you little kids didn't get no present earlier? There was one over here if I recall rightly? Well, what are you? Yeah, here, you are then. And one over here. Now, don't you go nauseous and won't go otherwise I'll have your mamma after me. All right, kiddies. That's all for this year. Santa's got to go back prepare for next year. All right. Be good. Bye bye, kiddies, be good. God! What? Do you think he's having us followed. I'll see. Kate! Well, hello, Cliff. - Is this how you make a living? - Yes, sometimes. I realize Cliff could be of great use to us through his connections. He's liable to reach a breakthrough long before we do. Well, we'll just have to keep in contact then. And exchange the latest news flashes. I was going to ask you just that. Call me whenever you want. Whenever you feel the need to speak to something. I might do that. Thank you. Come in, take a seat. Sorry to bring you down here with a police escort we don't like to take any chances. You haven't caught him yet? No we haven't caught him yet, but with your help we might get a bit nearer to it. Now as I understand it you were in your booth with a customer. He was such a nice guy. Yeah, yeah, they always are. And you were talking to him, and the curtains opened, the killer came in committed the crime and then just went out. - That's right, it was horrible. - Now then. - Did you see his face? - Yes. You did? You saw his face, so you can describe it. Well, no. You see. He was wearing a mask. And there was blood on the glass. It sort of covered everything up. I see. So you're telling me, that a man can stand in front of you, commit a murder, then turn around and walk out and you don't remember a single thing about it. I do remember one thing. His eyes. They sort of smiled behind the mask. If I saw those eyes again I'd recognize him. If he were was smiling. Not a lot to go on, but it's something. Right. I want you to go straight home. In fact we'll take you home in a police car and put a 24-hour guard on you. Can't I go back to work? Well I think it'd be inadvisable under the circumstances. You must remember, he knows that you saw him. Even with a mask so. Yes, uh, can we have a car standing by to take Miss Graham please? Yes, straight to her apartment and maintain a 24-hour guard. If you go down to the main lobby you'll find a sergeant Stevens waiting for you, all right? - It is that it? - That's it. Thanks very much for coming in. Yeah! Are you Sergeant Stevens? Dr. Stevens. he's just popped around the corner. But he'll be back in a minute can I help you? Tell him I've gone on already, can you? What if you hang on. He'll only be a second. That's all right. You're supposed to give me a lift but, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll just go on ahead. Chief Inspector Harris's apartment. Could I speak to Chief Inspector Harris, please? Oh, I'm afraid he's not in who's calling? My name's Kate Briosky. I need to speak to him urgently. Do you know where I can find him? Well... - Please it's very important. - Today's the day he visits Parklands. He goes there once a month. Regular as clockwork. Parklands? do you have the number there? Oh, I don't think you should ring him there. But he'll be going straight to the Yard after. Can't you wait? I suppose it'll have to. Oh, uh, please don't mention that I said about Parklands. I don't think he'd like anyone to know about it. - But what? - I've said too much already. Ring him at the Yard this afternoon. Yes, all right, thank you. I'm back. Thank god for that, we're losing business. Hi. I'm Sherry. What's your name? I haven't come here to give you my name. All right, you want to get straight to the nitty gritty, that's fine by me. You know the rules. Rules? What rules? You want to talk, talk. you want to see my tits that's an extra five. For 15 I'll take everything off and for 50 anything goes. What you do on your side of the glass is your business. Hey, what's with you? No, No! Shut up, you bitch! Or I shut up out that. - What you'll do to me? - I've not decided yet. What do you take me? I never heard you. You went to the police. I didn't tell them anything. No, but you would've done. I didn't see your face. You're was wearing a mask. Now you see it's too late. You have seen my face. Please, please, let me go. I'll do anything please let me go. You're all the same, aren't you? You sell little pieces of yourself. Five pounds for this. 15 pounds for that. 50 pounds and anything goes. But you're not selling desire. You're selling your souls. You can't leave me here I can't breathe I'll die. Please, let me go, please. While I'm gone. I want you to think of the error of your ways. - Then you'll let me go? - No. Then I kill you. Please, Inspector Harris. He's at home? Yes, getting him, please. Hello so yes it's, uh, it's Powell. Well, sorry. I just thought I'd call in in case you uh... You're off the case? I see. - There's been another killing. - And you're holding me? On what charge? No. I'm letting you go releasing you once and for all. Satisfied? Once and for all? How come? Because I believe I know the right man. Wheres part... Where's party? What do you think you? It's a party carrying on. Look, there's no party here, mate. - I'm looking this party! - Out, out, out! I'm looking this party! - I'm guest for. - You're not guest. You come back again I'll cool the place. Come on. - Merry Christmas to you! - Out! Merry Christmas.

Hello! Oh, Sergeant Powell, please come up. Miss Briosky I came as soon as I could. Things are pretty hectic as you can imagine. - I can. would you like a drink? - No thanks I can only stay a few minutes what you have to tell me. Well, it's rather embarrassing. - I feel I'm betraying confidence. - Get to the point, Miss Briosky. I telephoned Harris's apartment today, he wasn't there. I spoke to the housekeeper and she said something quite interesting you. Oh, really, what did she say? She said that he was visiting Parklands. - Parklands, so? - So it's a lunatic asylum. Look. I've been doing my own investigation. There's no record of his name at Somerset house. Now, if the records are to be believed, then he doesn't exists. Miss Briosky I came here because you had something important to tell me. Not to say he doesn't exist. Seems a bit ridiculous. So, I think you've made a mistake. I haven't made a mistake. Maybe he's changed his name. You're up a gumtree, so what have you changed his name. Look. I think there's something weird going. Harris keeps inferring that Cliff had something to do with it. But Cliff was standing right by me when my father was killed. Miss Briosky, I'm afraid I have to go. Look, I know. I'm on the right track. Well, if you find anything, let me know. We'll get there in the end, but, I'm afraid the register of births and deaths is not the way. - Dr. Bride will see you now, Miss. - Thank you. Oh, hello. Could I speak to sergeant Powell, please? It's urgent. Sergeant Powell's out on nine o'clock, but I... I'll put you through to the duty Sergeant and you can talk to him. No, it's all right, just tell sergeant Powell it's Kate Briosky speaking. And can he ring me as soon as he gets in. Thank you. Little boy, here's a train for you. That's pee everywhere. Yes, who's there? Hi. It's me, Kate. Come on in. You're on the right floor. Hello, what's the problem? I wanted to see you your car did offer a 24-hour service. I'm sorry, maybe you've got someone here. No, no. There's no one, let me take your coat. Come on through here. As a matter of fact, it's a pleasure to see a fresh face. And I'm very pretty man. Let me get you a drink. Thank you. Oh, how cozy. I was lucky to find you in. Must be quite a busy time. Oh, not particularly. Anyway for me. I've been fired, you want this straight. Yes. Fired? - Well, suspended officially. - Really? Cheers! - Well, I've had a row with Cliff. - I see. Cliff hasn't been himself recently. Ever since you practically accused him of being involved with those killings. He's almost started acting as if he were. - In what way? - He's become obsessed. Well, I'm no longer on this case officially. Well, in a way that doesn't change anything for me. You're the person I feel closest to at the moment. I bet you haven't had dinner yet. - Well, as a matter of fact I haven't. - It'll be my pleasure. - And, well, it's Christmas eve. - Turkey. With all the trimmings, Luigi. Thank you. Twice I've told you my name and you haven't told me yours. - Ian Harris. - Ian. Yes. It's not very interesting or romantic I'm afraid and I'm not even Scottish. I'm looking for the restaurant. Uh you're not dressed for the restaurant, sir. Yes, I know that. I don't believe it. He's followed us here. I was just looking for someone. Very good, sir, but you're not dressed for it. Oh! This came in earlier. I think it's important. - How did you get in here? - The porter showed me up. - It's cold in the alleyway. - What do you want? You can't just go barging into people's apartments uninvited. I can. I'm welcome everywhere. I'm a member of society. A very important one, they said. Look up Briosky in there for me, doesn't? You don't... I had dinner with inspector Harris he's expecting a call from me. - Are you telling me I'm here? - No. Yes. Then he'll come and take me away. Won't you? - Answer me. - I expect so. So very hospitable, is it? I saw Dr. Bridal today. We talked about you. No! Harris is your brother. - Did he tell you that? - No, I worked it out myself. You're very clever. What else did you work out? Harris's real name is Harrison. He changed... He changed it when they put me into the loony bin. He was very ashamed of his little brother. - But he visited you every month. - Under surface. I told him I'd write to the papers if he didn't. He used to tell me about his police work. So I thought I'd give him a real case to work on. - You killed my father. - Yes. It was... unfortunate. But you see... He reminded me of Christmas time. Got it. 439-2369. - Did I answer? - No. Come on, I don't see you. Might be important. Maybe your brother. No. Hello? Miss Briosky? She's put the phone down or somebody just put the phone down. Come on, we better go. I think she's in trouble. - Search the place, quick. - Okay. Hello, yes, this is sergeant Powell. Can you patch me through this to the special squad please? Yes, hello! Yes, Powell. I thought I told you to watch Harris night and day. You did? What he's been in it... He's been in his apartment all night? You sure? Oh God. Okay. Okay. Sir. I think our man's been spotted in the old tide ever... I brought you something to eat. How can I eat with my hands tied? yeah! Okay. If you try to escape it was for you. I won't, I promise. What about you? Aren't you gonna eat something? No. - I've already eaten. - Christmas dinner, I expect. Christmas? How do you mean? You know, it's Christmas day. Good will towards men and all that. I hate Christmas. I hate everything it's done for. - It's a shame. - Won't you know of it. Don't you remember when you were a little boy, listening to carol singers sitting by the Christmas tree. Waiting to open all those presents? - Stop it. - Tinsel colored fairy lights. - Plum pudding, snow falling. - I said stop it. And then the arrival of Santa Claus. The key? Where's the key? That's you're looking for? You're dreadful. I give few more hours and it's how you paid me? What do you mean "a few hours more"? Like you said, this Christmas day. The day you die. The supreme sacrifice to all the evil the Christmases. No! No! Come along, Giles. Time to go to the Christmas tree. Now then, Giles. Let's see what Santa's brought for you. But what about Ian? There are presents his too. What a nice knife. A knife or a grown-up boy. Isn't that nice Daryl? What a clever boy you are, Giles. Mama's boy, mama's clever. Oh, he's such a pretty boy, who needs lots of sleep make him grow up to be big and strong. So off you go now to bed. Night-nighty, darling. Gerald? Where are you? Get out! Gerald! Subtitles: Kilo
