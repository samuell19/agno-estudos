- Give me three cards. - Here. Are you in a hurry? No. It's to kill time. - If he doesn't kill, he has no fun! - Very funny! Five Dollars. Are you in? I'll pass. Thee guy that we are waiting won't pass. He doesn't pass. He will! The boss said it. - I call the five Dollars. - Three queens. Is that enough? You bet! One is enough for me! Raise the deck. Let's play another hand, then take Giglio's guarding place. You want to skin him, too? I've seen few sucker card players like you. - Good thing you have money! - It's true. The guy we must get rid of must be special. The boss is paying us 10 Dollars each. No, guys! It's no fun in three. Can I take the dead man's place? It's Giglio's place, and he isn't dead. Almost! I knock! You can't. It's not "Tresette". But l am! Anyone is good with guns. Thank you. Why are you taking it out on me? No, I'm not. The law is the same for everyone. No. You are off tune. Now it's ok. - I will bust you! - Stop! Odd or even? - Odd! - Even. - One, two, three... - You don't trust me? Eight, even! Odd or even? - Even. - Odd! You cheated! I'm not playing anymore. Darn it! - He is leaving! - Come back, you scoundrel! - You must give us a return game. - Young men! - Is this place available? - He's eating our dinner! You're not saying anything? Hey, Big Belly! Are you a friend of that bastard dressed in black? - Yes! He told me to come here. - Ok! You want to play with us? - I'll get the cards. - No. "Odd or even"? - Even. - Odd. Seven, odd. Mine! - Want to play again? - Yes. - Odd. - Even. Seven, odd. Mine! Want to play again? Odd again? - Always odd. - And me, even. Seven, odd. Mine. Let me see. How can it always be odd? They are five fingers! - You're hurting me! - One, two, three, four! Five. It's all correct. Hit me! Hit me! Even! Two and two is four. See? Even, mine! Hey, you! Where are you going? That pan is mine. Take it back! Try your luck, ladies and gentlemen! Try your good luck... Sir, I'm talking to you. You want to try your luck? Your good luck for only two cents. Choose. You're surely lucky, and a winner. Thank you and good luck. Goodbye. Look, Baby Doll! Half a Dollar! Are you happy? No? Don't you ever laugh? - Idiot, you don't know how to read. - I will never learn like this! Darn it! Boss, a man dressed in black is in your street. Tresette! Weren't Giglio and the others supposed to fix him? Right! It was a perfect trap. He's an ugly rat. Nobody tricks him! No, boss! You'll have me become an idiot with your slaps. - Good-day. - Is the proxy ready? Director, Mr. Smith is here for that proxy. - Mr. Smith... - That's me. - You can tell me. - Mr. Smith... The notary's signature is needed. Our bank is very scrupulous. What the...? - Ouch, boss! - Go on! Ha... ha... Hands... U... Up! - This is a holdup! - Boss... I mean, a withdrawal. Decide. Holdup or withdrawal? We are busy here. Come on. I am the partner of one of your clients, Frank Faina. Or Slim Popcorn, or however he is called. He swindled me... So I.. He did it! He owes me money. It's exactly the 100,000 dollars he deposited here. Funny, huh? No! The poor man has become crazy. So he can't withdraw. Right? So he sent me. Right? - The key, please. - The key? Wha... Wha... Wha... - Thank you. - You're welcome! I want my partner's safety deposit box. I'm sorry. No key, no safe. No... No... I don't have the key, but I have this. Well? If you insist... - My gosh! - Get down! Who do you want to impress with that contraption? It's already noon! No, it's that sucker Frisco Joe. He didn't know about the cannon. - What'll we do now? - Crazy stuff! Raise it! That's it! Ok! How lovely! What's that? - Is this the way to the asylum? - The insane asylum? Yes, the asylum is that way. This is an insane asylum too. Help! Pull me down! I can't stand it anymore. Help! Thank you. Silence! Silence! - Let's go see. - Listen to that commotion! Where do they think they are? At the Chamber? How shameful! He's off his rocker! Look at what he did to me! He's the senator! Did you know he was a Juventus fan? He's crazy! Get him. Tie him! - Let's call the sheriff! - Go away! Let me by! - Help! There's a lunatic there! - He's totally insane! - Let's run away! - Call the army. How embarrassing! Help! Thank you, "herr" director, for this urgent hospitalized. This and much more for a colleague of the famous Vienna school. - Who is it? - What? I am counting on your discretion. We're travelling incognito. - Ja. I mean yes. - Charge! Charge! - Are you crazy? - Yes. Why? Charge! General Custer! Little Big Horn is on the other side! His imperial highness, arch-duke of Austria! Is he crazy? No, thank you. Some other time. - "Nein"! Complete! - Nothing to me? One! A little medal! Little one! He's really... He is convinced of being Democratic. But he's the future emperor. He can't be a Democratic emperor. You were right in taking him to America. He'll heal from Democracy here. I trust the American revolutionary technique. I can entrust my patient to you for a small shock therapy based on electricity? - Are you deaf? No! - A little medal! - I said no! - Help! Let me get off the horse! - Do you know the electric chair? - Electroshock! Yes! He'll recover, dead or alive! Are you crazy? I'll give you an electroshock! Save the professor! Hurry! You get down! This isn't the riding range. - Have faith! - What is it? Always with the American flag on top. I'm not the White House! See? He is robust. It's best to use strong methods. Thank you for your trust. I am honored. - I am honored. - The honor is mine. - I tell you that the honor is mine. - No, mine. - If I may, it's mine. - No, mine. - It's mine too. - Be quiet! - Will it take a half hour? - Yes. There is the electricity problem. To save, we do electroshocks every other day. I could take advantage to visit your modern insane asylum. - My assistant will accompany you. - "Nein"! - Why disturb him? - No, I insistently insist. My assistant will accompany you. - That way, please. - Come, Professor. Let's enter from the main office. Go away, ugly animal! Take him away. It's not time to walk him yet. Why don't they put a railroad crossing? I'll give you a medal for your bother. - Ja. I mean, yes! - Show me the patients first. Watch out! The Colorado Express. It is never on time! My famous method is that of a country where the individual is respected. Neither cold showers or chains in my asylum. - Understand, highness? - "Highness" disgusts me. Certainly. I can understand. But you must open up completely to me. For you I'm not just a doctor. I am everything. I am a friend, a mother, a girlfriend. I care for you, my dear. Don't get so friendly and call me "highness". - Don't wink at me! - I am winking at you? I am winking at him? Be quiet! He thinks he's the Statue of Liberty. - Does the other believe in liberty? - Who believes it anymore? He believes in cigars. They're his. - Help! - What about him? Excuse me. Help! Help! - Help! - No, it's not an interesting case. A simple persecution mania. He sees three huge men following him. - But they don't exist! - I find it interesting. - I'd like to examine him. - No! There are hundreds of cases more important than his. These: blind, deaf and mute. No, they are new. They're just any three huge men! - "Bitte". Interested in the medal? - Ja! - I want that man. Where is he? - I don't know. You think in an asylum we won't find a lunatic? This way! The director is here! Let's see. He's not here. Maybe he is here. No! He's here, but it's not him. It can't be him. It can't be, but where can he be? Why isn't he here anymore? I'll check again. No. Don't go over there. It's impossible. - Stop! You can't. It's closed. - Open! - Never! - You want the medals? Then open. - The dangerous wild ones are there. - Two medals. No, I can't. - Three medals! - I really can't. I want to ruin myself! Four medals. I'll open! - How much? - Four medals. - Four medals? - I pass. - Pass! Please... It cures everything. Excellent for total lunatics. He's not here. He's not in here. I know, and I always fall for it! - The door! - Excuse me. He's not here. - It won't open here! - Darn it! Why won't it open? It's crazy! - What is this? - It looks like a key. It's the key that won't open a thing. I never understood why. Help! Help! - Help! - He has a fixation. There he is! Help! I am honored, highness, of being able to experiment on you the new therapy I invented based on the principle of electric energy. Are you ready? Go! Minus ten, minus nine! Minus eight! - What is he doing? - I don't know? Six! Five, four, three, two, one, zero! This way. Hello, chief. Sitting Bull. He's not here. Here either. Scoundrel! I'll destroy you! You took away my chair. Now I am Standing Bull! - Don't run! Where are you going? - I don't know. My glasses are gone. Tresette! - Poison! - Present! Are you crazy? In here, too? You are missing a sense of measure! I caught you! You weren't expecting it, huh? What? You've been trying for two years! Now we'll see who the fastest gun in the West is! - You want to shoot? - How will I kill you, if not? I don't know. I only know that if you shoot, we'll stay here forever with a straightjacket. You think? - Cigar? - Why? Even men sentenced to death, smoke. - We'll fight later. - Of course. We'll fight. It's good. Didn't you used to smoke cigarillos? Yes. But they make these just for me. I see! You don't trust me! Tresette! Tresette, where are you? Come out and fight, if you have the courage! Tresette! Tresette! - What is it? - Sleeping medication. Don't move. The needle will break. - Tresette, you tricked me! - Of course! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Professor, colleague! Help me! - This way. - Thank you. You're a friend. Who is it? Help! A friend, my foot! Help! - What do you want from me? - I told you to sing! - Are you being funny? - Am I disturbing? If you want to play, play softly! I have to sleep! I am in command here! Do you mind if we form a quartet? You aren't crazy, just stupid. Stop! One, two, three, four, you hope to have him sing. One, two, three, four, big mistake. He is shrewd. One, two, three, four, since he doesn't want to be found, one, two, three, four, he hid in an asylum. One! Where are you going? Why doesn't he want to be found? He stole the 100,000 dollars of the Yuma post office holdup. Go! - Mine or yours? - Don't know! Hadn't Frisco Joe stolen it? Frisco Joe had stolen the money on the train. But that shrewd guy who was in the gang, swiped it from the boss. Right? That is what Frisco Joe told us when he sent us here. What've you got to do with it? - Thank you. - You're welcome. My head! What happened? - Hey! Where do you want to go? - I have to... Let me go. I am the director. You're leaving me with this on my head? Are you crazy? Did you say you're my mother? Then cure me. He said it, didn't he? - You don't trust me? - Well... Stop winking at me! How are you, Frank Faina? I don't know how Franco Faina is. I don't know him. - No? - I am Slim Popcorn. Popcorn as in "popcorn"! - Popcorn? Oh, come on! - Nobody believes me! Everyone says they are someone else in here, but I'm not another person. I am myself, and that's all. Coffee! My coffee! You're dropping it on the floor? Scoundrel! I'll have you fired! You have me wait an hour for coffee and you drop it on the floor? Did you forget who the boss here is? I am in command here! I want coffee in bed. Go get another one. Go! Reverend, excuse me. He is right. He really thinks he is Slim Popcorn. Oh, please! Oh, please! Then why are these dancers upset with you? - They are Frisco Joe's people. - Frisco Joe? Reverend! Who is Frisco Joe? - This guy's partner! - But I'm not Frisco Joe. - You didn't say it, but he did. - Me? - Go "fudge" off! - You cause confusion with names! Frank Faina! I am Slim Popcorn! - No, you're Frank Faina. - Why do you say he's Frisco Joe? Who is the lunatic in here? Enough of machine slavery! Enough of revolutionary techniques. I said enough! Let's say yes to revolutionary therapies. I called this solution "Fresh Head". I have the exclusive of the formula. With its psychomotor vessel action, it stimulates the cells of the brain, re-activates the blood circulation and expels the fumes of folly. Nine madmen out of ten prefer "Fresh Head". - Tell him you are Frank Faina! - No! - I'm Slim Faina. - It's not true. - Frank Popcorn. - It's not true. - Darn you. You're making me flub up! - Stop it! - He's right! - Thank you. You started it. - Who sent you in here? - The people of the United States! - I'll tell you who I am. - Silence. Who questioned you? - Him! - Why? He says I'm Frank Faina. It's crazy! You had me believe you are Slim Popcorn. But I am Slim Popcorn. Who gives a darn! Don't scream! I am in charge here! Coffee. How disgusting! It's cold! Bring a hot one right away! Run! Then you are Slim Popcorn. - Frank Faina! - Yes? What are you making me say? I am Slim Popcorn. Help! I'm suffocating! I am Frank Faina! I'll talk! Help! Help! You've decided. Where is the key to the safety box? Key? Box? What box? I don't understand. Oh, no? Yes, come! Come! - It's yours. - Thank you. I'll tell everything! Stop! Help! What is it? - Where is the key? - Where is it? Alright. Keep the key. When you leave here, go to the bank. Who will you find? - Who will I find? - Frisco Joe and companions. You want to see what they'll do to you? Is it my turn? What are you waiting for? Help! I'll tell you everything! - I'll tell you where the key is. - Swear! - I swear! - He'll swear. Let's celebrate. - Why the champagne? - I launched him. It's tiring to negotiate with them. It's not good for you at your age. I'll do all the work. 50-50. No, I'm the boss here! I don't agree to fifty-fifty. - Let's... - Let's do this! Our rule is that the patient must feel at home. - Excuse me. - Be careful! The patient must relax in a serene atmosphere that offers all comforts. We have personalized personnel too. - I don't like chatting barbers. - Excuse me. - Close shave. - Yes, sir. I went to my home in Cactus River and slept at my cousin Drakeman's. - Get to the point. You remember when you went, but not where you put the key. - Of course. He's crazy. - Hey! I don't remember, but what are you doing with that straightjacket? - I'll tell you later. Go on. - While I was running away, I fell from the horse. - Poor thing! I hit myself here and it still hurts. A lot! But in Cactus River you had the key. Four Eyes, what are you doing with this straightjacket? - What do you care? - What do I care? I am the boss here! - You aren't the boss. - Oh, no? Are you the boss? He is the boss! - The key is in Cactus River. - I don't know if I lost or hid it. But it's in one of those places I told you about at Cactus River. Murderer! You're doing it on purpose! You don't want me to have coffee, but I... No, I'll have coffee at the cafe. I'll go to Chicago where they make excellent coffee! Come. I'll pay yours, too. Go! - Go, go! - Finally alone. But I don't know what you're doing with a straightjacket? - What is it? - Show me your tongue. Achtung! His highness is in danger! Save him! There is a big epidemic! Your patient is very sick. Unfortunate, some more, some less... Not in the head, but in the body. It's full of small red spots. Absolutely disgusting! No! Darn! Sir, excuse me. I'm talking to you. - Do you mind helping me? - Wake up! Wake up! Look! Get me out of here! Hurry! - What's the matter? - Don't know! Don't be afraid. It's a joke. Who cares. Let's get him. Are you starting again? I already said everything. - Help! - It's terrible. Look from outside. - The plague! - The plague? - He's kidding. It's carnival. - Help! Let us out! Adam! Where is that darn key? Don't let them out. I'll send them the vaccine from Vienna. Thank you, illustrious colleague. What a gentlemen! What a scientist! What a friend! Fuck off! - What is it? - Poison. Tresette, I know you're in there. Come out and fight. - Are you vaccinated? - No, why? - There's the plague! - You think of anything! But I won't fall for it! Do I look so stupid? No. "Poison" is written on my forehead! "P" as in powerful. "O" as in omnipotent. "I" as in intelligent. - What is it? - Be careful. Let's run! Help! - Run! - Help! After you, highness. Something is fishy. Why are we going to Cactus River at night? To look for the key. - Very funny! Why at night? - Because at night someone sleeps. - Someone? - Would you sleep at night with so many trains going by? - No, I'd be furious. Like the people at Cactus River. They don't sleep at night. So they are furious during the day. Can you go faster? I am trying. The 3 huge guys were running so fast they must've reached Frisco Joe. If we don't step on it, they'll soon be on top of us. - Let's hurry. - It's not easy with this thing. Why did they put austerity for horses? In the east they cut the fodder supply. Idiots! Imbeciles! You let him get away! It was the pan's fault. Hold still! How can you get a cannonball shot in the rear end? He should have gotten hit in the face. But the boss didn't get tricked and turned around. You are shrewd, boss. Slo... slo... Slowly, butcher. - Where did you take me? - He's the best vet in Texas! You expected to find the Policlinico's head doctor? Boss! Dar... dar... Hold still. I can't see very well. Darn them! They weren't capable of having the old man talk either. We have to follow Tre... Tre... Tre... That makes nine! - Always on this side! - Where did Tresette go? I didn't ask him. Guys, the boss wants you! They must be afraid of... - The plague! - The plague? Let's run away! Hurry! Who doesn't run away with me, may the plague... hit him! Is this carnival time? - Are you stupid? - I am. Why? - Just a moment. - Hurry up! You ugly son of... To you and your sister. You tie the bike? Isn't the time you had me waste, enough? Is it my fault if we got 3 flat tires? It'll be dawn in 2 hours. Who has undertakers work, get up early. Let's get going. Here they are! Hurry! Let's go! Who is he? Look at that ball! Bravo! Bravo! - A perfect fall. - My foot! - The step is broken. - No. You are good. You're an artist! You are good and modest. Welcome to the big family of the Drakeman Circus! - Where is the circus? - I am the circus. Look! Your attention! Drakeman, the great knife thrower. Drakeman, the acrobat. Drakeman, the equilibrist. No hands! Drakeman, the illusionist! Drakeman, the tamer, the horseback rider, the acrobat! What are you doing? Watch out! Don't scratch yourself, murderer! That is very delicate! Cleopatra! Come out. Don't be an idiot. The gentleman doesn't know you. Here you are, you little rascal! Give your master a little kiss. Now go to sleep! Sweet dreams. Dream of a nice big dog. Go in the house, first floor. Drakeman, the flea tamer. Ok, Circus. You want me to tell you why I came to you? Circus, where are you going? Where are you? Circus! - Who goes there? - Voilà! Drakeman, the clown! Did you come on your own, or did someone send you? Slim Popcorn told me... Frank Faina, my cousin! Bravo! I told him I wanted an assistant. I can't do everything. Drakeman, the magician. Pick one. - Did you look at it? - Yes. Keep it. I have another fifty-one! What is it? Ladies and gentlemen, Drakeman the juggler! I will teach you everything. You must use your hands well, but above all, your head! Oh, God! Oh, God! The lion! - Is it you again? - No, Agenore the lion. Hold still. I hope he likes hit. He's become fussy with his ulcer. Today I cooked rabbit in white sauce for him. Look! - Poor Harvey! - Is it still you? No, it's the tamed rabbit. I cooked it because the lion has an ulcer. As they say... Better a lion today... So I'll do the hat number with the cat. He isn't trained but he doesn't scratch. Harvey! Daddy's pet! You're not cooked. Jesus, I ate the cat! It's ready! I'm coming! I'm coming, Agenore! The master's favorite. I'm coming! Here! It's me. Your meal is ready. Drakeman, the orchestra conductor. Taste how good it is. My boy! The key! Yes! Where did he put it? The key! He didn't like it! It's in here. What are you doing? This way! Go on! Go in. - What can it be? - What can it ever be? A cat. Go! Who are you? Help! My gosh! Get out! Stop! - What is it? - I give up! Wow, what a cat! The glove is cumbersome. - Who was that? - Why are you whistling? I'm here! Go on! Go on! Darn, it's dark! - What is it? - Be quiet! Don't cause a mess, imbecile! Or it's not a surprise. How will we surprise Tresette? - How? - What did the boss tell us? - "Imbeciles"! - He said to hide in Frank Faina's home and to wait for Tresette to massacre him! Don't make me laugh. The slap hurts. Get up! Up! Listen. You hide there, and I'll hide here. Boo! Tresette! Hi. - No. You can be seen like that. - Pull me down, imbecile! - You can't do it. - Why not? It's not fair like this. Dictator! You're kicking now, too? What'll you do with the scissors? You want to cut the rope? You can't leave like this! I'll show you! Give me your hand. The hand! Not the finger! One! Two! Three! Four, five, six! Seven, eight, nine! Ten! Out! Cigar? Drakeman, fire eater! - Give me your eyes! - Why? Drakeman, hypnotizer! Sleep! Sleep! - I'm not sleepy. - Sleep! Sleep! I did it! I did it! It's the first time since May of 1962. San Gennaro performed the miracle! Who is it? - Good evening. - Does he have iron in his head? What do you want? They don't answer! - Acrobat! - You are fans! - You want an autograph? - Pull out the key. Right away. Ladies and gentlemen, here's to you, Drakeman, the illusionist in his performing number. - Your attention! - Is it the performance? For free! Voilà. Here is the key. No, it's a safety pin. Just a moment! "Voilì" and voilà, the key is here! I never guess! "Voilì" e voilà, the key is here! The sardines are hanging on to it, but the key is there. Listen, acrobat! I don't like it. If you don't give us Frank Faina's key, we'll play a nice game. - We'll have you become a sardine. - And we'll put you in here! - What key? Frank didn't leave any key. Hold your hands still! You don't know who I am! I am Drakeman the magician. I’ll make you disappear! Show us how you do it. Abra cadabra, the bad man will disappear! He disappeared! Yes. One, two... One, two and... How much is three minus one? - Two! - Sure? He really disappeared! Your attention. Guess what is in here. - The key! - No! A punch! Give us Gelsomino back! - Right away! - Pull him out! You want to go on playing? - I'll give you a return game. - Thanks. - Guess what is inside here. - A punch! No! A mouth rinse! Look who is here! Odd or even? You won't trick me. Let's count! - For me? - No, for me! Alright. Bravo! Bravo! Watch out! God bless! Bravo! Watch out! It's hot! Let's run away! - Help! - This way! Circulate! Arsonist! Go to sleep! Now we'll look for the key. Tresette! I found you again. Fight! In a closet? Does it seem serious? What if people find out? - Excuse me? - You won't trick me! Who could find out in a closet? The woodworms? - Right. If you insist... - I insist! - I insist. - Help me, then. It's disgusting, Ku Klux Klan brothers. So disgusting that it disgusts me! Did I explain that? The blacks have raised their heads again. You know why? No, you don't, but I'll tell you. We just play around, we goof off here. We don't work! Dear brothers, we sleep here. As the proverb from our dear south says, "Who sleeps doesn't catch blacks!" Understand? Boss, it's "Who sleeps doesn't catch fish." What do I care about fish? I want blacks! Is that clear? - My nose. - Pardon me. My foot! I am a gunfighter, not a clothes rack. It was your idea. It's crazy to fight in a closet. I told you there's no room. Hold this. - The ear! - If they hear us, it'll be a mess. - Why? - Those people hate blacks. - What do we care? We are whites. - Me. - And me. - No! - What? Do you have a mirror? You have a dark face. - What? - You want them to hear? My face is whiter than a mozzarella. - It's what they all say. - Who? - The mulattos. - Say that to your brother! I warned you. They kill mulattos too. I'll kill you! - Watch out. - Be quiet! - You could have blinded me. - If they hear you, they'll... - To who? - To you and all mulattos! Silence! Silence! Silence and shame on you. You know what the Great Dragon of Dallas writes? Yes, very well. "Respectable Ku Klux Klan section of Cactus River, etcetera." Excuse me, but who is this "Etcetera"? It's the address, idiot! - Fix them well. You'll wrinkle them. - I am not a wardrobe assistant. Are you pushing? Don't be difficult. You want to fight? - Yes - You know the rules? - What rules? - Darn! I must do everything alone! - We take 10 steps and shoot. - You won't trick me. We can't take 10 steps in here. - You're right. We'll make do. - You're shooting behind my back? I would never dare. Look at what we'll do. Get to the fifth tunic on the left. - Which fifth tunic? - The one with the red dragon. With the red dragon? You are blind! - Now? - I see nothing. You tricked me! Did you tell the Great Dragon of Dallas? I told him we finished the blacks. He insists that we must borrow them from some nearby town. You know what else he said? Down with the Ku Klux Klan! Long live blacks! - Who did it? - I didn't! Let's kill the black! Don't let him get away. He's the last one. You can't find anymore. Imbeciles. You must get him! You two, get him! I'm not black, I'm tanned! I'll explain how you catch a black. Blacks run faster than whites. You can't see them at night. Maybe they got him. Go. But ask who it is. Who is it? I think it's a train. Imbecile, ask for the password. Password! I said it was a train. - You... What do you want? - Cousin Frisco! What a great surprise! Look who is here! - How are you? - You... you... You look good. Maybe you gained weight. I get by. You look good too. A chair for cousin Frisco. I can't, thanks. I suffered from that too. They hurt. - What did you understand? - That you have hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids? Cousin Thunderball, they... - Shot me! - You? I was hun... I was... - Hun... hun... - It happens. I was hunting a darn son of a ballerina. - Black! - Well... You... you... Another one is passing by already? - All dressed in black! - Did you hear, brothers? Destiny sends him. Black! Cousin Frisco, count on our help, whatever you need. - Don't worry. - In fact. I heard he came here to... - Ca... Ca... - What are you saying? To Cactus River. Right in your cen... Center? In our center? Is that guy looking for trouble? A k... A key! What key? The one... - The one... - I already said it. What key? - The one belonging to Frank Faina. - Our dear old Frank! - A real friend. - Not really. This is his house. He lent us the basement for our meetings. - So he was here the last time. - Sure. He always comes by when a sheriff is chasing him. He slept one night here and one at Drakeman's. - Hold... Hold still! - You stutter too? - You're also interested in that key. - Yes. Is it this one, by chance? Give it to me! - Thank you. - That key doesn't open anything. - We tried it everywhere. - Repeat that! You said a key that doesn't open anything? What do you want? - What is this? - A key. It's the usual key that doesn't open. The key to the safe isn't here in Cactus River. That scoundrel Frank Faina always had nearby. - What? - He had put it with Adam's keys. - He... he... he... - He screwed us! - What've you got to do with this? - Tre... - Tre.. Tre... - Makes nine! - He is Tresette! - The guy with the dead man? Just a moment! You! Wait! One, two... The cousin doesn't have a hood. Two went out. Five, six, seven, eight. You are extra! Just a minute. I'll count. One, two, three, four, five, six. - It's my turn. I'm going out. - Just a moment. No. Because one, two, three, four, five, six. - No! - Where are you going? It's me. - Bamby, they want to hit me. - Why? - I don't know. - Catch him! Tresette, why... - I'm not him! - Darn! Darn! Surprise! Surprise! Double surprise! - Why do they want to hit you? - Because of him. Just a moment! Go ahead. Excuse me. - What did he do? - He told him I am black just because I'm dressed in black. - Who? Frisco Joe? No, Whistle Joe! Many thanks, highness. Very kind of you. Watch out! What're you doing? - Don't tickle! - Stop! - Who took the key? - What key? - The one that never opened! - The old man took it back. Slim Popcorn! He died with the plague. - Where is he? - He asked where he is. The old man? They took him away. He asked for a nice funeral. He had us call a trusted funeral home. - What funeral home? - Enough! The name is written on the register. - Where is the register? - In the new director's office. - The new one? - Yes, the other is a barber now. May I? Is anyone here? Tresette, fight! - My respects. - What? You didn't understand a thing. It's a trick to fool you. I am Poison. - Poison? - Poison! I admit there is a certain resemblance. No, you have more intelligent eyes, virile moustache and a spacious forehead. Poison has a shit face! Yeah, yours is handsome! Have I lost that much weight? What a keen eye. Then it means I am ill! I don't sleep at night and have nightmares during the day. My head is so confused. There's a big mess here! - Enough! - You don't keep an office like this. It's so messy! You can't find anything. If someone wants the register of the lunatics, what does he do? Please! Can't you see the mocking smirk? Do you see these? What is this? - The director's robe. - In fact, director! Help me. If I don't find a solution, I will go crazy! Stop it! Hold still. Enough! Darn you! Do you realize what sort of wise guy Slim Popcorn is? He pretends to be dead and has his Strikers friends take him away. Since when they own a funeral home? So he went to get the safe. - Thanks, director. - Forget it. I am not the director. - I am not the director! - Good and modest. Is it like this? You should get the Nobel prize for this invention. What a mind! What a magnificent scientist! A small electric shock, and it all goes away. Head-ache, nightmares and everything else. Five, four, three, two, one. Contact! You know what a furious tiger is like? - The Strikers are worse. - Darn! Maybe you made his boots too tight. I've never made wrong shoes! - So what? - I tried them on at his home. The Brambilla company is a serious one! Instead, they massacred me. Those Strikers! You go see them and they beat you. You talk to them and they beat you. You touch them, they massacre you. - Who? - Him! Brambilla, we can take the boots to him. Are you mad? Modestly speaking! Know where we come from? The insane asylum! He gestured to you that I have an ace! Who? Him? He would never! Right, boys? - On our honor! - What did I tell you? Don't worry. We don't swindle people here. Hey! Give my friend another drop of wine. - No, enough! - You don't drink? Who doesn't drink in company... - He's first a thief and then a spy! - It'll make me drunk! - Frascati is getting you drunk? - Yes. It's better than champagne! The wine of these vineyards makes wonderful wine since the days of Noah. Zac! Play. "Briscola"! - Briscola is spade. - Spade? - Briscola is spade? - No! It's what I thought. Slim, you're either cheating or the wine is going to your head. Then don't drink it. Take everything. - I won this one too. - Yes, you won. Here. You skinned me alive! - I only have one bag left. - What a complainer! What do you want from me? Did you call for me? Did I come to the asylum? Did I pull you out? Who took you to the bank? My grandmother? Who asked you anything? Did I ask him anything? Nothing! They are the truth personified. You complain just because I ask you to play a game of cards? You want a return game? Charge! I should have kept this to pay a real funeral for me. If Tresette comes... Tresette? Are you kidding me? He just has to try... I'll get him, bust him, destroy him and beat him. I'll strangle him, knock him out, wring him, nail him, trample on him! Then I'll take him and put him in the sun a couple of hours. I'll shake his hide and then off to the ossuary. Shoemaker, wasn't it enough? Hello! A lovely day! Yes. Now you're cleaned up. Come here, dear. I have to deliver a pair of boots, but I don't know to who. Good! They aren't his. - Did he break? - Yes, darn you! How refined! Big belly, whoever comes here doesn't say "hey". - He says "ouch". - I don't understand. I'll explain with gestures. What? What is going on? How dare you? Behave, Cinderella! I will bust you! Darn! - We should've bought a shoehorn. - Right. No, it's not his! - Can you touch? - Darn you... Hillbilly! Seventy-five... Slim, you're done for. Two to zero! Cards to you. Pelliccione, go check this commotion. Are you a fakir? What did they throw at him? Boots! - Who ordered them? - Me! - My gosh! - Behave! You are Tresette. Very good, Mr. Strikers. Exact answer. You win a gold coin. Are you kidding? These are mine. - Who do they belong to? - His! And your granddad's! Let's try to make things clear. You want some advice? Beat it! Get lost, disappear. Everyone is a crazy here. Did I explain that? Mammaliturchi, proceed! Excuse me. Did I make myself clear? - He deflated me! - Then you want war. Deflate this! Boss, what did he say? Did I make myself clear? Nothing. Thanks! Thanks! So much the better. Someone could've gotten hurt. - We had fun. And now? - Let's play a game. Briscola? You'd like that! I'm playing away from home. Tresette. Tresette? Then too bad for you. I'll play a spades "Napoli". This is gambling! It's not fair! I didn't understand who is keeping score. How is it played? - Answer to spades. - I've no spades. What should I do? I'll teach you! I take you, I bust you, I destroy you, I hit you, I strangle you, I floor you, I wring you. I beat you! - What is it? - Do you mind turning the page? - Thanks. - You're welcome. Welcome, my foot! - Boss, free me. - Where are you? - In the middle of the net. - Call a fisherman. Where do I find one? Fiumicino? - You can't do that! - Cheater! Why? It's the first time I've ever played. May I? Thanks. Are you a hard-head like me? Yes. - You too! - Yes. Just a moment! Come on! - Go! - What'll you do now? I don't know. Nobody explains anything here, but you want me to play. You want to frame me? Just a moment. - What is he doing? - A knot. Go ahead. Tresette, there are no more swords. What'll I do? Use the trophies. - I'll use the trophies! - What is it? - I can't see clearly. What game is it? - Blind Man's Bluff. Boss, I freed myself. You need a hand? - No, a chair! - I'll get one. Here, boss. Here's a chair. - Boss! - Stop! - What do you want? - What is he reading? - I don't know. What are you reading? - "The Three Musketeers". - That's not fair! - Why not? The instructions are written on it. Let's get the book. Go! Play, play! will get diamonds. Excuse me! Migue!! - Who are you with? - With you. - Then come here. - Yes, hold it. Here I come! How many trophies do you have? I have a long run! What do you mean? Don't move. Him? Boss, excuse me. I'll go looking for a belt. Him? Me? You lunatic! Hold it. Hold it again. Hold it again. Is this what you do? Drop the sword, if you have the courage. - What'll we do now? - I don't know. I'm playing clubs! - Boss, what should I do? - Mind your own business! Boss, did I hurt you? - Excuse me. - It's nothing. - As a prize, you'll take a nice trip. - Great! Where? To fuck off! Now it's your turn! Did you repeat after me? Who did it? - What are you doing? - Playing clubs. I'm playing big slaps! - What happened? - Trophies don't rule anymore. The clubs rule. - Mistake. - Why? Tresette knocks with clubs! Enough! What're you doing? The diamond is mine. Tresette, I'm talking to you. I am nice and kind, but don't make me angry! You're leaving? Hold me back or I'll kill him! Nobody is holding me back? They're not holding me back! - Goodbye. - Good night. Bye! I swear I won't do it again! Keep it all! Who do you think I am? A cheater? We had said "fifty-fifty", less extra expenses. Hold it. So... "Transfer to Cactus River, Ku Klux Klan center indemnity, bicycle purchase, various insurances, recuperation amount from Strikers". The rest is yours. Proceed, Bamby. - Thanks. - Forget it. Tresette! - Here he is again! - One more game. Now you're playing "The Black Man". I caught you. Where are you going? Fight! Yes, I'll fight! I won't let such an anniversary slip away. - What anniversary? - I'm surprised, Poison. It's the 13th time that we fight! Thirteenth? Thirteen brings me good luck. - It depends. - Enough! Let's get to the point. I am ready. Happy birthday, Poison! Look! What's written there? "To Poison, the fastest gun in the West". Don't exaggerate. I'm not the fastest. Everyone knows. Don't be modest. You are a rocket! Here. Blow! Blow them all out, it brings good luck. I'll get the champagne. Aren't you ashamed? He'll have a liver problem! Why? The cream was fresh! - Bye! - Take care. It's true. There is only one Tresette, everyone else is nobody.
