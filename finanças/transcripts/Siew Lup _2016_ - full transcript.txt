My name is Wu. My work is quite special. Most people talk at work. For my part, I'm busy with those who have fallen silent forever I give them their last dignity, accompany them on their way. And grant their family's last wishes. It is said that God controls our destiny. My apologies. Hi. I am Wu, the manager. Can I help you? My mother passed away. Let's discuss the details in my office. - Alright. - This way, please. What I can also offer you, as you see here, is a special antiseptic make-up. I had no idea at the time... that our fates... were already bound together. Look. Outward, she seemed strong, but I could see how vulnerable she really was. And that she was fighting inside. Your food. Enjoy it. Let's drink tomorrow. Why are you lying there like a dead fish? Huh? Why can't you keep me happy? We have tried so many times. You can't get it up. Why can't you turn me on? Like before. - I have tried. - Enough. - You don't trust me. - Trust you? Look at you. You walk around like a whore. No wonder all men want to grope you. - But Gao is trying too. - Gao is my buddy. Why would he do that? I'm warning you. You better not do anything behind my back. If I ever find out, you'll be damn sorry. Yes, please have a seat. - What do you wish? - For two. Sure, come soon. Mia, take over for a moment. I'm going to the toilet. Bring that to Gao. Okay, I will. Gao... stop it. - Hello Mia. - Hello Wu. Quite a lot going on. Yes, indeed. Don't you have anything to do? Actually, I do. I.m meeting a customer here. Ah, okay. How are you doing? I feel much better already. Thank you for asking. Don't fret too much and take care of yourself, alright? I will. Sit down. I'll bring you a plate. Sure, my pleasure. You dirty whore. I'll strangle you! Why are you laughing? I'm laughing because you can't get it up. And yet you want it so badly. You... Mia. Oh... This is for you. - Surely you have not eaten anything. - Thank you. I'm off. Are you all right? Sit down and let me see that. You should be more careful. I have something for that. - Easy. - Hmm... Be brave. It will get better in a moment. Later... she told me... up until now, only Quan... has ever cared for her. Thank you for being so empathic. My mother can now rest in peace. That's my job. You don't have to say thank you. Nevertheless, thank you very much. She also told me, that it was that moment that she fell in love with me. You are very welcome. I know what you are going through. I experience this every day. I only came here to take over my father's business. He died recently, you know. So if there is anything I can do for you, please let me know. Hmm... I am sorry. Hang in there a little longer. Hmm... Ready. Apply this regularly. Then it will soon be fine again. You can call me by my name. As you wish. Mia... I have to go. What's wrong? Are you okay? I have to go now. Take care of yourself. Huh? You forgot something. Thank you very much. I'm sorry you had to come all the way here again. You're welcome. I hope you'll soon be well again. I'm off. If at that moment. I would simply have gone... everything would be different. Mia. I don't understand... why you let him do this to you. You can't let him treat you like this! What should I do? Leave him? He saved me. My mother and I are from Malaysia. She was very sick. We did not have enough money for the medicine. Going with him... was the only way out. Quan saved my life. Here you go. There you are. Oh. Hello, Mrs. Chen? Gao here. I have proof that your husband is cheating on you. I'll send you the video. Until next time. Thank you very much. - I'm sorry. - Huh? Closing time? What is your name? Are you available? Not right now, but I can give you my number. Ah, one of Ang Mo Beng. Great. I'll give him a call. Ask for me. Vicky. Ah! And can you keep up with her? - We can both spoil you. - You know what? This is a great idea! I think so too. - Hey. Get out. - What? Quickly and don't argue. - From today. - Hm. Come. Be nice to me. Huh? Wow! Go. Do it properly for me. Stop, your teeth, teeth, teeth. Yes, yes. That's it. Go on, go on. Yes. Hmm. Oh... Look. Isn't she hot? She has one hell of a body. Wow, let me get to it first. Hello? I saw her first, so I get first dibs. Fuck you! Go ahead and call your pimp. Go. Go ahead. Who is there? Get ready. Mia will be here soon. Yeah, get ready. And you? What are you looking at? Hello, my name is Mia. Ah, come in. Gladly. It's okay. No problem. Huh? - Thank you. - Until next time. Sure. Mia... can I see you again? Sure. You know how to reach me. I mean, after work. You can have any woman. Why do you want me? Because I like you. When Ang Mo Beng finds out... I'll get into trouble. Big trouble. Why are you so afraid of him? Were I to leave him... he'd kill me. Or even worse... he'd hurt my mother. I'm scared of him. Don't worry. I have money. That's all he's about. - Mia. - Huh? Promise me... that you will start anew with me. I promise you'll be happy. Hmm... Hey. Her again? Tomorrow it will be my turn. I have a date with Mia. Keep your hands off her. I like her very much. Don't you dare touch her. Call the pimp. I want to buy her from him. Are you crazy? Do you know what that's going to cost you? Everyone knows that Ang Mo Beng is totally crazy. Don't mess with him. I am not afraid of that. I know what I'm doing. Call him. Whatever you say. You got it. - Hello? Ang Mo Beng? - Yes. Yes. My buddy Quan wants to buy Mia. Uh, uh, buy her? Buy Mia? Meet me at Quan's restaurant at eight. Be on time. Till then. Fuck you. Who do you think you are? Hey Ang Mo Beng. Hey, hey. Thanks for coming here. This is my buddy Quan. So you want to buy Mia. She's very good in bed. Hot stuff. What's your offer? Fifty thousand. - In cash. - Oh! So you're setting the price now? You're rich, you're a big shot? This is a good offer. But I'll tell you what: Mia is not for sale. I came here to show you the to say in person. Out of respect. With a body like that... I won't let her go! She will continue to make money for me. Take your money and stick it up your ass! Ang Mo Beng won't be fooled so easily! Char Siew Quan, fuck you man! What are you laughing at? Hey! Stop, stop! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, let's talk! You're so big and powerful? Huh? Huh? - I'll let her go. - Yes? - Do you give me your word? - Yes! Break your word, and I'll cut you into pieces. Okay, okay. You got it. Give me the money. Fuck off! You ass. He takes his anger out on me... because he is frustrated. He feels useless. I think the Quan that I once loved is still there. Forgive me. I'm so confused. I don't know what I'm talking about. That's all right. I understand. Take care of yourself. I understand you. I'm leaving now. Wu. Do you like the little bugger? What of it? If you can't satisfy me, I'll look for someone who can. Don't you dare say that again. You are impotent. You're calling me impotent? I'll show you how impotent I am. - Stop it! Stop it! - I'll show you! I can't take this anymore. Help me. I promise. He will never hurt you again. Everything will be fine. Oh, Wu... promise me... What? You'll never be with another woman. I promise. Gao, I want to tell you one thing... All these men, they don't come here because of the good food. They come to gawk at Mia's breasts, and her body. I'll let you in on a secret. When I was little, my mother... slept with other men. I've seen it. And my father... used me as a punching bag. Yelled at me. Again and again. I have him to thank for this scar. What did I do wrong? Why did he treat me like that? When I croak tomorrow... no one cares, not even Mia. Especially not Mia. Ah, Quan. Don't beat yourself up. You are like a brother to me. And I will take care of Mia. Huh? Come on. Oh! - I have you. - I want another drink. One more step. - I want another glass. - Sister-in-law, help me. Give us a hand. Just one more glass. I want to keep drinking. I want to keep drinking. Quan is asleep. - Now you can be nice to me. Huh? - You are crazy. Let me go. - Gao tried to rape me. - The bastard. I'll take care of him. No. If you do, he'll know about us. And what about Quan? I can't live like that. I just don't want to go on living like this. Oh, Wu, you have to help me... get rid of him. We could be together forever. Will you help me? Huh? Yes, Wu? It will be fine. Don't worry. Mia... Are you still hurt? Forget it. Let's not talk about it. Let's have a drink instead. Drink along. Let's toast. I'll get another bottle. Go ahead, stab it! He is dead. I'll kill you! Let him go, let him go! You dare? Wu, it's your turn. From that moment on she was a different woman. She was no longer the... injured Mia that needed protection... ...but someone who scared me. And then she came. The other woman... ...that changed my life. Hi, can you help me? Oh, hi. Hello, my name is Wu, I am the managing director. Here is my card. How can I help you? My name is Xuan. I have a funeral to organize. I understand. And whose funeral will it be? My own. I am terminally ill. And I have maybe another year to live. My one wish is to go in peace, and to have a beautiful funeral. That's all I can do for myself. I've heard great things about your company. How professional you are when it comes to funerals. So I want you to fulfill my last wish. Um... Gladly. Let's go to my office and continue talking there. Thanks already. Please call me Wu. This way. We have many offers... It was hard to grasp that someone, who has only one year to live, was so open to life. and so optimistic. Who was the woman you were making out with? I have already told you, she is a customer. You mean former lover. Don't lie! - Why don't you believe me? - Listen to me carefully: I will not accept you being with another woman. Wu, I am tired. We can be together forever. I will not tolerate you. being with another woman. Are you alright? I'm fine. Go back to sleep. Please have a seat. - Menu number 1 for one please. - You can sit down over there. - Menu number 1. - Sit over please. - I would also like to have menu number 1. - Okay. Coming up. - For three? - Sure, have a seat. I'll be right there. Thank you. Wow, delicious. Hm... Please take a seat. Mia? Where is Quan? He is out of town. He's visiting his grandfather in China. He wants to see his grandfather one last time and say goodbye. He's taken the first flight this morning. Forget it. Oh, all sold out? Business is very good today. Ah, I'll be back tomorrow. Mia, you know what I like! Take a look at this model. They are very popular. Here in the showcase is the latest urn design. I like white best. So beautifully simple, I like this one. Ah. - I can reserve it for you. - Hm. They are freshly caught for us. By hand. I like being with you very much, Wu. Everything about you is just right. Xuan... Aren't you afraid of dying? What do I have to fear? The diagnosis is 'incurable'. There is no remedy for it. Now if I can't change that, why should I be afraid? I really admire you. You are brave... and optimistic. If only the others were like that too. Who exactly are you referring to? I'll be honest with you. I am with Mia. But that's over. I simply can't be with her anymore. You are so different. You are like a fresh breeze for me. I feel free and safe with you. Xuan... I like you But... I have no future. I don't care. I just want to be with you. Even if it's only for one day. My body is with Mia... But my heart is not. When I spend time with Xuan, I am happy. You are running out of time. That's why we appreciate each moment together. Wu. Do you know what my second last wish is? Tell me. When I die... my beloved shall be with me. Go inside! I know about your relationship with Wu. And also from Quan's sudden disappearance. But I am not here to expose you. What are you talking about? I told you, Quan is visiting his grandfather. Stop lying, bitch! I don't care if Quan is alive or dead. I do not care. What do you want from me? I like it when you are so direct. What I want... No, what I really want is... to shoot a video where you touch yourself. - And then I will fuck you! - You perverted asshole. Your secret is safe with me. As long as you do as I say. I promise you, I'll give you a good time. Huh? Huh? Go for it! Yes, that looks so hot. Groan for me. Louder! Go ahead. Groan for me. I'll give it to you good. Huh? Is that good? Huh? Turn around. Do you like to shoot videos? Why do you think I'm letting you film this? Damn pervert. Go to hell. I used to go there a lot as a kid. It was a lot of fun. I would have loved to have been there. Here it is. Get lost! Get out! Go to your dying wife! You're heartless! Don't come back. Mia killed someone. What are you going to do? Call the police. You can't. Why not? Do you remember Mia's husband? Mia and I are responsible for his disappearance. What are you saying? Xuan. Promise me one thing. Whatever happens... ...you must never leave me. Mia killed Quan. I was there when it happened. But I didn't. She was trying to get me to, but I just couldn't do it. Xuan, you have to believe me. And what are you planning to do if you don't go to the police? I'm going to come clean with her. I have evidence of the murder. She's not going to hurt me. Xuan... Mia. Did you also murder Gao? You have changed. You are not the Mia that I fell in love with. You are a cold-blooded killer. I'm afraid of you. Are you gonna kill me like you did the others? We're going to end this here. Okay? Sorry. Wu, please, please don't leave me. Don't leave me. Stop. Stop it. We can't go on like this. It is useless. You're leaving me for this whore? Is that true? You're leaving me for her? Have you gone crazy? She is as good as dead! What is wrong with me? Am I not better than them? I will change for you. You just have to tell me how. Stop. It is only me. Only me. I love Xuan. You love Xuan? And what about me? You swore to love only me. Why are you doing this? - Why are you doing this? - Yes, I loved you. I helped you kill Quan. But looking at you now, I'm just scared. Scared? You were not afraid when you fucked me. You've totally lost it. You motherfuckers are all the same. If I can't have you, no one can! Wu? Wu? Wu! Wu! Wu. Stay with me, Wu! You have to get out of here. Run. Wu! Run! Oh, Wu! Xuan... Promise me, Wu. You'll never be with another woman. I promise. Wu. I often wondered where it was going. I never thought it would end like this. I really have to admit... I never thought it would end like this. Wu... Do you know what my... second last wish is? To di in the arms of the man that I love. If I could turn back time... It wouldn't change anything... about my love for these two women. Just like my life... my story also ends here. For Mia, however, this is only the beginning.
