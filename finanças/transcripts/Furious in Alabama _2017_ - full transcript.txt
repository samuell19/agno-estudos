Got it. Gonna work? Would've work. All right. Wanna see what she do? Dang right. Get in. This thing ain't even close to street legal. We get out on the highway with this thing Sheriff Wilkin's gonna kick our butts. Can't kick what he can't catch. Yeah! Hey, man, we better head back and get ready for the party. I'm ready. You want to go in this? Yeah, why not? You ain't even got headlights. Hey, hey. Why don't we just go back to the lake instead? Man, this our graduation, Lurvy. What, you getting cramped up or something? No, no, I'm good. All right. Here you go, man. That car is so cool. Even your daddy's car won't get you laid, Bryson. It'll get me to the party. Here we go. It's just Bryson. He just don't know when to quit. Open your eyes, Lurvy. Tell him bye bye. What you stopping at your Uncle Charlie's for? I told him I'd bring it back. Oh, my goodness. Well, look at this. How are you, sir? Good, good to see you, Ty. So good to see you. Lurvy. Come on, Lurvy, stop messing around, man. What do we have here? Said I'd show you the car that's win state this year. What you think? What happened to all the windows? Yeah, it's pretty stripped down. Don't even have headlights. You think we got a winner? Yes, sir, I do. Yes, sir, I do. So tell me I'm not gonna lose my best foreman to a race car this summer. No, sir, no, sir. I'll be full-time starting Monday morning. I'm just kidding you boys. Well, I don't want to hold you up, Uncle Charlie. Y'all be careful out there in this thing tonight. Yes, sir. You have fun. I will. Come on, Lurvy, stop messing around, man. Be careful, boys. Yes, sir. Oh. Oh, hey there, Bryson. Maybe next time, huh? Bryson? Yeah, he's got it. He's got what? He's got that look. Hey, Ty. Man, I'd be all over that. I'm in training, Lurvy. Man, put your tongue in your mouth. What are you doing? You don't never give her the time of day. I gave her the time of day once. That's why she keeps rubbing on me like a house cat. You did? Man, you did? I don't know what he's doing here? Did he build that piece of crap? Yeah, and his uncle paid for it. Wrecked the last one. Thinks he's gonna go pro or something. Pro? We can count on it. He's gonna end up drunk in the clay pit just like his daddy. Hey, Ty. Racing's one thing, my daddy's another. What's he doing here? Becky Fleming's on a date with him. Shut up, Bryson. Lookie, lookie. It's the little engine that almost could. Didn't you graduate about five years ago? Hey, Ty. Hey, Becky. All right, Lurvy. Screw this party. Snake's just an asshole. Yeah, I don't know what Becky Fleming sees in him. She's about fine, too. Yeah. Well, she was until she started hanging on him. Man, look. There's just some things that are out of our league. Like winning the state championship. You got to stop all that talk. We ain't even won the local track, and that money your Uncle Charlie gave you, ain't nothing up to what Turner Auto spends on Snake's car. Yeah, some things you don't need money for, Lurvy. And you're a better mechanic than anybody they got. Don't you forget that, man. I wish you'd stop saying that, too. Look, Lurvy. I mean, here it is, right? Graduation. People going off to college. We can't afford that. Way I see it, I'm only really good at one thing, and that's driving cars. That's the only chance I got at making something of myself. I don't want to end up another drunk in clay pit. Man, don't say that. There ain't nobody that thinks like that. And forget about Bryson. He's just a loud mouth. Yep, and people that don't say nothing are pretty loud, too. Let's get on out of here. They don't think I can do it, Daddy. What about you? Come on. Can't do it myself. How's he looking, Lurvy? He's looking pretty good. I'm about to wave him in. Probably need to take some weight off the outside though. Oh, look, there's Snake. He don't even hot lap, does he? No, not usually. Well, good luck on the money run. I appreciate it. Come on, man, you ready? I'm almost done. You like the tires? No, that'll have to do. You raise that right top four link bar? Yes, man. Come on, it's time to go. It's a little different than a lawnmower engine, isn't it? Like you anything about an engine. Bring Daddy's mechanics with you? You know you can tinker with that junkyard piece of crap all you want. When you're ready to run with the big boys why don't you come on out. I might not put you in the wall again. You ready? Yeah. Bastard's mine. All right, folks. We got the street stop feature coming out of the gate. Local boy, Ty Hargrove, is back and I mean way back after a bad crash against the wall a couple weeks ago. He's got a new sponsor Aldwin Tow and. Let's see if he can get some points back on the board. On the first row taking the inside position is our point leader, Snake Turner, in the number 15 car. On the high side is Lloyd Briggs in the number 12 car. Easy on turn one, Ty. Don't take it too low now. Coming down the front stretch is Snake Turner in the lead with Ty Hargrove breathing hard down his neck. Stay high. Catch him on the straight away. Don't you do it, Ty. Come on, you know better. Come on, man, get back in there. I got mine over at the gift shop. Whoa, that's cool. You have fun tonight, buddy? Yes, sir. Do you think you can beat Snake? I was just warming up tonight. Hey. You want to get in bed? What time is it? About one in the morning. I was close tonight, Dad. So close. It was right there. I can beat him, I know it. I'ma ride up there with you on the next one, son. You said last time. She's kicking my butt, boy. Well, kind of looks like you're kicking your own butt around here. Y'all know nothing about this. It made you taught me. I know if anybody's quitting right now, it's you. Just won't stick. I ain't got the right stuff. But you did. You still do. Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. All right? I qualify for state, you gotta get straight. How about that? That's fair, right? Ain't gonna be nothing if I got at it all worried about you anyway. Just not right in my head when you're like this. Come on, Daddy. I'm afraid to make that deal. Why? Because I know you gonna win it. And when you do, I will let you down. Ty, can you come to the office, please? Ty, will you come to the office? Hey, Cindy. Hey, Ty. Come on in, son. Hey Uncle Charlie, Aunt Paula. Morning, Ty. How are you, son? Good to see you today. I'll just leave the two of you alone. You have a good day, sweetheart. Thank you. You, too. Aunt Paula. Sweetheart. Tomato sandwiches, huh? Oh, she's been making these for me a long time. She's a good one. Yes, sir. You sure have been moving a lot of poles across the yard lately. I'm really proud of the job you're doing. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. I sure wish Frank would've taken to this place like you have. Well, I know Frank wants to go to college first, sir. And knowing Frank he's probably goofing Well, it is college, sir. I'm sure he'll be just fine. Yeah, well I don't want to talk about that. We got a lot of good stuff going on around here. We've been meeting with investors, and we're gonna start making concrete poles. We just closed on a piece of property up the road. We're looking for a man to run the operation. I told them that I think I've got the right man for that operation. Okay. And I think that man's you. Me? If you're interested in the job. Well, yes, sir. Yeah. I tell you what. We're gonna have a little cocktail party with the business men tomorrow. Why don't you leave work a little bit early and go home put some nice clothes on, and I'll pick you up about six o'clock. Sound good? You serious, Uncle Charlie? Absolutely. Thank you, sir. Get on out of here and go back to work. All right. I'm gonna do what I can with this intake. See if I can get some more horsepower out of it. How much for a new carburetor? Well, about $400. Dang. She can suck up some dough. Tires be another thousand, right? Yup. Well, I might get the money next week. Why don't you give me what you can on the intake now. I'll just hold it on turn one, she'll still be in the race, right? Oh, yeah. Hey, Daddy. Hey, son. Please tell me you boys still think about girls. I do. So I'm gonna end up like you? Some floozy I gotta shake. Easy on your old man, boy. Guess who Uncle Charlie's making manager of the new plant? What? That's right. Well, well, well. I'm proud of you, son. Got some big meeting tomorrow night with all the investors. We're gonna have to get you cleaned up. Right, yeah. Right. Hey, maybe something with some buttons. Might need a suit. Yeah, Ty. Hell with that. Come on, Daddy, let me show what we got done. Come on in. How are you, Jack? Trying to get this place cleaned up, Charlie. I'm almost ready, Uncle Charlie. Take your time, Ty. A little bit early. How's the dirt business, brother? Man, I can't complain. Been a long while, man. Yeah, too long. You know I appreciate everything you've been doing for him. Not doing him any favors. He's worked hard for everything he's got coming. He's the best hand I got at the pole plant. Will you look at that lady killer. What you think? Looks good, Ty. I ironed the hell out of this shirt. And you impress them, son. Yes, sir. You just be yourself. You ready? Let's do it. Good to see you, Jack. Good to see you, brother. Y'all be good now. How many people are gonna be here, Uncle Charlie? Not too awfully many. The investors are gonna be here. I don't really want you to be too nervous now. I know this is real important. I know, Uncle Charlie. But you know, you just be yourself. And just be respectful, okay? Yes, sir. This Becky Fleming's house. Yeah, Lyle Fleming is one of the investors. I've known the man for 30 years, and I do trust... Excuse me. There they are. Good to see you, Lyle. Good to see you. This must be our horse, Charlie. This is Ty Hargrove. Nice to meet you, Dr. Fleming. I hear you knew about everything there is to know about poles. Trying to know as much as I can, sir. Charlie says you're quite a race car driver, too. Well, yeah. I guess you can call it a hobby, sir. Is it like the NASCAR I've seen on television? It's mostly homemade rigs all on a dirt track. NASCAR will do some dirt, but that's mostly asphalt stuff. Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? You know, Ty? Yeah, from school, Daddy. I thought you're spending the night over at McCane's house tonight? No, mom wanted me to stay. Help with the party. Ty's gonna be plant manager of the new pole mill in my with Charlie Hargrove. That's right. Uncle Charlie wanted me to meet everybody. Excuse us. You look like you'd rather be anywhere but here. Hey, Becky. Na, I just get the feeling they think I'm the only one who knows about making telephone poles. Well, then you must know a lot. I just know what Uncle Charlie taught me. Well, it's obvious you know a lot about cars. I think Snake's actually worried about you. Your daddy don't know you go to the races, do he? It's not really his thing. What's the thing about Snake? He hasn't said much. But he knows his daddy owns a Dodge dealership in Atmore, right? That makes him okay. I'm sorry, what does that have to do with anything? Nothing. I'm just kidding. Well, maybe I'll see you around the track. Okay? Oh, tell Snake to watch his ass. I will. Well, the lake models are about to line up for the money run, folks. Will our local boy, Ty Hargrove, beat out our board leader Snake Turner? Well, we'll see. It's gonna be a great race. Let's have some fun. Can our local boy, Ty Hargrove, do it tonight? Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think so. Come on, Ty. Right now. Now. You don't have him. You don't have him. Well, that's it, folks. Hope you can stay around for the big party tonight. Donnick is back, and we've got cold drinks, snacks, shirts, decals, Indian blankets, jams and jellies, and left-handed nostril inhalers. Hey, Ricky. Hey, man, you got a tuner bar I can borrow? Yeah, actually I do, man. It's over in the trailer on the left side. Just whenever you get done if I'm not over there, just put it back in there. Appreciate it man. Yeah, Charlie bumped me out there. Knocked something loose. Weld it all this last week, too. Man, it's always something, right? But don't worry about it, man. You did great tonight. Thanks, man. I still can't get up there with Snake though. We're gonna change out the carburetor this week. Man, it's definitely a horsepower problem. You're getting through the corners sweet.

Yeah, he's like a nice guy. Best one I know. Probably one of the best jobs in town. I've tried to. What about you? What do you do? I work at my daddy's clinic. Front office stuff. It's really not interesting. How'd you get involved with Snake? He asked me out. It's that easy. Pretty much. You must get asked out a lot. Not really. Doesn't really seem like your type.

You know my wife has your number on her car. No kidding. Yeah, we're rooting for you to go to the state championship. All right. - Appreciate the support man. - Sure. You been calling her or what? Yeah, I've been calling her. What's her daddy think? I don't think she's told him yet. How she gonna go to the race with both of you there? My truck. Well, that's it, new carburetor. Ought to give us 40 more horsepower. All right. How much money we got left? Enough to buy a tank of gas and some peel offs. Gotta get some tires. Yup. Well, believe we've done all we can on the carburetor? Unless you've got $1,200 more bucks for a TCC custom. Yeah, what's Snake at? He's got a TCC custom and $1,200 more dollars that's for sure. Well, just have to get a heavier foot. Man, it's all you tonight. Got a new carburetor, suspension's dead on, Snake's a no-show. Man, that pisses me off. I ain't complaining. Dude, this is our chance to catch up. He knows he can blow off an entire race and still roll out of here with more points than me. Man, if we win tonight we're almost tied with him. Yeah, you're right. Let him get cocky, I'm right on his ass. Can our local boy Ty Hargrove do it tonight? I think he might. Ladies and gentlemen, there doesn't look like there's much competition, and Snake Turner didn't even show up. - We need those points, man. - That was awesome. - We need those points. - I know. We're good now, we're good. Oh, great. Oh, cool it, partner. Are you with this loser, Becky? Oh, you got something you want to say to me? You bitch! Ty, Ty, stop. No, leave it. Come on. Stop. Stop it. Stop, knock it off. Wanna play that way? You might have a slight concussion. Is that bad? He'll be okay. He needs to stay with us tonight. Let me have a word with you, Becky. What were you doing at the race track? That's what he does. I was with him. That might be what he does, but that's no place for a nice girl. Daddy, when you say nice you mean rich. I mean nice. You're going to college next year. You're not gonna work at a grocery store. It wasn't about you, Ty, but this isn't a place for Becky. I get it. You okay, man? Yeah, take me home, man. You should go to the hospital tomorrow and have that checked out. Man, that was about me. What do you expect from a man like that? Hey, cuz, what's up? Good to see you, man. Looks like dad's been a little rough on you. Oh. Yeah, little scuffle. Nothing serious though. Thought you were up at university, man. I have been. I'm just in for a little bit. How's it looking up there? Making the team or what? I don't know, man. I really don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't think I'm gonna go to school if I can't play football. I mean, you can try your odds somewhere else though. Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, I just want to stop by. See how things were going. Yeah, man, it's going all right. You know. Well, I'll see you around, man. Good seeing you, Frank. You, too. Okay. Come on in, Ty. I hear you're quite the attraction. Oh, well. Just a couple of us are local down there. Ah, yeah. You heard. I heard. I can see, too. I might have messed up, sir. It happens. I could've helped this. Yeah, I hear you might even be going to state. I don't know about that. I mean, even if I did I'm not sure what I'd do about it. You know, I got responsibilities around here. Can't just leave. Oh, don't make me have to fire you. All this will be waiting on you when you get back. This chair to be yours some day. I'm serious, you know. You're like a son to me. I've always felt that way. No different than my own kids. Thank you, sir. You still pulling that car around with that old 1500? Yes, sir. Well, sometimes. Lurvy and I'll switch out so we don't burn up our transmissions. Tell you what. Why don't you take that old diesel? I know it's old. It's got about 250,000 miles on it, but she still runs good. A lot of power. That old beast in the yard. Yeah. All right. Thank you, sir. I'll get her cleaned up. What else do you need, son? Na, we're all right, Uncle Charlie... Ty, what do you need? We need tires, sir. Is that all? Just need tires, sir. Why don't you go up to Sweats and pick out what you want, put it on the account, okay? Wow. Thank you, Uncle Charlie. Really appreciate it. You seen Frank? Yeah, I saw Frank. I don't know if he's gonna turn out to be the big football star he thought he was gonna be. I think he's a little bit embarrassed. Maybe he'll come back here and go to work for you. Uncle Charlie, I just wanted you to know that I appreciate any opportunity you have for me here. I just hope you know that. You just tell me what you want me to do. I want you to win that race, Ty. Yes, sir. Hey. Trying to get me in trouble? No, I just wanted to see what all the talk was about. The big investment. Don't you have work? No, we close at noon on Tuesdays. There's not too much to see yet. Has my daddy stopped by to give you a hard time yet? Na. It's a fight, right? What time do you get off? About four o'clock. What do you usually do afterwards? Go home, work on my car. Every day. Yeah, pretty much every day. Well, what about today? What you got in mind? Let's go somewhere. What's your daddy gonna think about that? Shouldn't have said those things to you. Yeah, probably right, you know? You're going off to college and all. Well, I didn't say I wasn't going to college, but I'm not gone yet. Okay. I'd get cleaned up first. That's fine. You can just pick me up when you're done. Whoa, wait, your house? Sure. Why not? Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Your daddy's not home is he? No, but he will be when you drop me off. Uncle Charlie owns about 500 acres. Daddy used to come out and fish right here. Why not anymore? Daddy's not in real good health. So you tell Snake? Yeah. How'd he take it? Not well. I just don't get it. Why Snake? I mean of all the guys in town. Snake. It's a small town. A girl can have a little fun. God, Ty, you act like I married him. It was nothing. Okay. Can you please, please not think of anything about Snake or racing for one night? Just one. I just know how I'm supposed to beat him. I mean, he's got everything money can buy. I mean, money gets you more horsepower. More horsepower gets you up to the front. And not to mention he's got a whole car dealership full of mechanics working for him. Full of tires. I mean, tires are probably the most important part. I mean, I... Well, you're lucky somebody shut off that loader before you killed yourself in it. I told them to take me back to the office, they took me here anyway. Come on, Daddy, not everyone can tell the difference with heatstroke and passed out drunk. I know. Well, how are we gonna pay for this? We'll be all right. Yeah, if somebody can keep a job when he's smashed on bourbon. We ain't got doctor's insurance, right? Dang. Well, I mean, we got what? Three hundred a month around the office, right? We got payments on at the loader and the pit. I guess, I can stop putting money into the car. You ain't just sit there and get pickle all day while I pay for everything. I guess, I'll live there, too. You don't even talk like that, son. Don't make me think like that, Daddy. Dang, Daddy. You look ridiculous. Get up. This place is too expensive to lie there and dry up. Bye, Ty. All right, man. Hey, brother. Cause some heart attacks around here. Hey, check that out. Yeah, got a fan. Whatever. So you have a number all over town. It's like you were Kyle Petty or something. What you know about Kyle Petty? I underestimate you, Tyler Hargrove. I figure you did your shopping in the city. Family practitioners aren't exactly millionaires, Ty. All the money's in the specialty practices. Come on, it can't be that bad. You got some pretty nice stuff. Yeah, no, it's not that bad. But with college expenses coming up it doesn't hurt to be frugal. Oh, hey, look. Oh, I have no idea. I think you'd look good in anything. Thank you. Damn, this thing's fine. How long did he say you can keep it for. I don't know. He said he didn't need it. Dang, man. Hey, how long you got for lunch? About an hour. Is that gonna give us enough time to get these tires and take them back to your place? Man, if we just got enough time to buy them, throw them in the truck, and stare at them a little bit that'd be enough for me. Good luck, Ty. Thanks, Betsy. Good luck tomorrow night, Ty. Bringing the whole family. Thank you, Mr. Chase. Welcome. We put your car magnet on. Thank y'all for supporting me. I really appreciate that. Go get them, Ty. Thank you, sir. You're like a dang movie star. Come on, man. Huh? Oh, yeah. That's the one. Oh, look here. Hi, Lurvy. Hey, Becky. He's been dreaming about engines since the day he was born. I'm telling you, Ty. It ain't shiny, but it might be as good. Well, so what? You think you can beat Snake now? I said might be as good, not as good. What's Snake's real name? Well, I don't know. But you went out with him. Okay, so I forgot to ask. I hate calling him that. It's like agreeing with him that he's good. Right? Lurvy can do magic with an engine. Now he squeezed out every last bit of horsepower possible. If we ever had a chance to beat Snake, we got it now. It's a long shot. What the hell, man? We ain't find the heat. I don't know. Maybe bad gas. Bad gas? Been on the same tank all night. You boys having car trouble? I said something to Sherry. Son of a bitch. I want to kill him. You think he did it? If he did, we can get him disqualified. Can't prove nothing. Let's get back on the trailer. We got to get back in the race. We ain't in the race, Lurvy! What are you doing? Waiting on him. He's on the winner's block, man. Got to come this way eventually, don't he? Come on, you're just gonna get us all kicked out of here. I can't let this go, man. Yeah, you can. I got a better idea. What? Come on, follow me to the car. What, man? Come on. Okay, just sit down and cool off. This better be good, man. Turn one, Ty. You can spin him on turn one. What are you talking about, man? I'm talking about Snake. I watched him race tonight, and he almost lost it on turn one. He still won, didn't he? Well, yeah, but he's slow through the turns and fast on the straight aways. Two times Ike Smith was right on his tail, slid past him. Snake got nervous then almost lost it for no reason. Don't you see? No, Lurvy, he still won. What are you trying to say? Snake's fast, but he can't handle the pressure. You're fast you don't have pressure. You can beat him on the turns. With these tires, hell, you can even get low on turn three. This car's perfect. Yeah, except it doesn't run. To hell with that, I can clean out the bad gas. You're ready to go again in no time. Son of a bitch. Why don't you just ask her to dance? Who? Sherry. Oh, Sherry. He won't ask her. Why not? I don't know. Why not man? Well, I just thought... I don't know. You talk to her enough. You might as well, right? She's right there, man. Go ask her. Go ask her, man. Okay. Okay. I will. You seem distracted tonight. You think? I'm sorry. You still have a chance, don't you? Statistically, yes. But realistically it's over. Oh, come on. All you have to do is win next weekend. Snake can't do any better than third place. Two things I've never seen happen. Well, I think you can do it. Still hasn't asked her. You're no fun tonight. Sorry. Just wore out and pissed off. Wanna get out of here? Do this another night? Sure. I'll walk you to your car. Hey, Blake. Hey, Ty. Man, I am sorry about last night. What happened? Car trouble, man. Well, you still got a shot though, right? It's not looking good, you know? It's a long shot. Oh, come on. There's always next year. I mean, think about it, right now you have an incredible job, the most awesome sponsor, dude, it's just a matter of time. Yeah, you're probably right, man. I appreciate it. Thanks, brother. Have a good one, man. Yeah. Hey, Daddy. Daddy! I know how much he meant to you. You think it would've been me have a heart attack. Me, right? I don't want to talk about it, Daddy. All right? Yeah, you might as well get started. Don't hold back on account of me. Put that down. Hey, put it down. It ain't right you were too damn drunk to go see him. What I got now, Daddy? Daddy, what I got now? Nothing. Hey, Ty. Hey, Frank. Aunt Paula. Just thought I'd come by and see if there's anything I can do. I don't know what all this is, Ty. He always took care of everything himself. You know that. Customers are calling asking me questions. Lyle Fleming called, wants to know what's going on at the concrete plant. Oh, isn't there like a manual or handbook or something? Look, you guys deal with Cindy and all the office procedures, all right? I'll take care of everything outside the office, the yard, everything else. Tell Dr. Fleming to come see me, all right? You want me to go out there with you, I'll go out there with you. Sure, man, come on. Thank you, Ty. I hope you like tomato sandwiches. Yes, ma'am, thank you. It's become a habit. Ty, thank you for everything. Welcome, ma'am, least I could do. Come on, Frank. Bye, sweetheart. I can do this. What a mess. Uncle Charlie meant a lot around here. They'll come through for him. Who's in charge now? I guess Frank. I mean of this place. I don't plan on quitting. Are we gonna stay on schedule? Unfortunately, I had to miss a day for the funeral. Yeah, all right. Ready to lay in about a month. Hey. I'm really sorry, Ty. How are you? Been better. Daddy said you're in charge now. I guess for now I am, yep. You'll be okay, Ty. Na. Na, I won't be crap. The only guy who gave me a chance is dead. You'll be all right, though. What you doing coming around here anyway? I came to see you. Your Daddy was right, okay? You're out of your league with me. Why don't you stop messing with my head? I don't need it. That's not fair, Ty. Fair? Fair's in your life, not mine. I gave you a chance. All right. Where the hell you been, man? How do I get into this thing? Oh, Daddy must have locked it. All right, look. Go find me a crowbar, then let's go over everything again... No, forget all that, Lurvy. That's done, man. What are you talking about? The championship's in two days, man. What's the point, man? Even if we win, which we won't, we can't make it to Phoenix City. Costs money, Lurvy. Fuel, hotels, crew. We got none of it. You got money for gas, hotel rooms, crew? Do you? No. Then it ain't gonna happen, is it? We ain't got the God danged entry free. Just forget it, man. Listen, Ty. I'm sorry about Uncle Charlie. I really am, but you can't just come in here and quit on us. I'm tired, man. I'm tired of trying. All right, I'm done with this. We're done with this. Okay, fine. If you can find me a key to this thing you're gonna feel... I told you it's over! Try your way. I'm gonna do my part. Forget Phoenix city, we could at least win locals. All right, I'm just gonna get it on out there for everybody to see. I don't want nobody saying I didn't do my part. I do what I say I'm gonna do. Ty, excuse me. Ma'am. Alabama utility wants to know if they're order is ready. Yeah, it's bundled up in the back lot. Thank you. Aunt Paula, you know there's a radio inside you use to call down here. You don't have to keep coming out. I'll have to remember that. Maybe I just wanted to get out. You don't look so good. I'll be all right. We both will, won't we? Yes, ma'am, we're just fine. Thank you, Ty. Hey, Ty. Hey, man. Hey, do you still have the keys to this truck? Yeah. Cool, can I just get them back from you. I'm trying to get everything... Sure, man, it's your truck. I'll just grab a ride from Reed. Yeah, you're done with it, right? It's yours, man. Thanks. All right, brother. Hey, where's Ty? He ain't coming. What? Look, you tell anybody who asks I was here, and I had it ready. What happened? I don't know, Sherry, he's just messed up. Look, you better go back in the stands before they close the gate on you. Your daddy said you'd be here. Lurvy came by my house before the race. He's dragging that thing out there? Says he is. You know he also says you're not going. That's right. You know Uncle Charlie would want you to. You know, Ty, there's two kinds of people in the world. People that watch things happen, and the people that make them happen. I thought that was you. I thought you were the one to say to hell with the cards I'm dealt, I'm making my own way, and anyone who wants to go with me. You know my daddy's taking me to the race tonight? You even got him believing in you. What do I say to him now? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Deep South Speedway. We're about to rock and roll in a country sort of way, and if you're lucky, you'll get dirty. And first place in the modifiers go to Jimmy Hacker out of Kansas. Now ladies and gentlemen, the even we've all come here for. The street style championship, but I'm sorry to say that Ty Hargrove is not in the out suit. He's cutting it awful close, isn't he? Well, if you're ever looking to join the winning team... I ain't looking. If you change your mind... Son of a! Hey, man, get in here. You're a dead man Hargrove! You're dead. She said you're coming, I didn't believe her. You got it ready? Hell, yeah, I got it ready. Hey, remember turn one. I remember. Hey, I'm sorry, man. It's all right, man. Come on. Oh, she said to give you this when you got here. Knock them dead. Well, tonight's the night, folks.
