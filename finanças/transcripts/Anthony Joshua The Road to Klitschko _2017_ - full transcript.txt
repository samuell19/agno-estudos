[jazz music playing] [narrator] Once in a generation a special fighter enters the ring. More than a boxer, he transcends his sport. Brutal. Brilliant. Unbeaten. But now a shadow falls across the ring. A challenger emerges more dangerous than before. At Wembley Stadium, Britain's Anthony Joshua faces Wladimir Klitschko for the heavyweight championship of the world. The British golden boy against the man who held the title for almost a decade. It's the biggest live event in the history of British boxing. A fight that can make Anthony Joshua a global icon. It's a fight, that Anthony Joshua could lose. Hey, man. No paparazzi, man. No paparazzi, man. [Joshua] Right now we're in New York. This is the official AJ versus WK, press conference. So, we're doin' a little tour. ♪ Start spreading the news ♪ [man 1] So, where's the champ? [man 2] He doesn't want to talk to you. He says, "Keep me away, keep me away." [Joshua] I'm fighting a legend in the sport. [woman] I'm going to steal you for some makeup, if you want to follow me. [Joshua] We're not a best of friends, we don't exchange messages like, "Great day today, bro." There's none of that. But I think there's just that mutual respect as what he's achieved and what I'm trying to achieve. [man] He doesn't need to be groomed. [laughing] [Joshua] I've been trying to tell them. [Joshua] What he looks at is that, I was that guy and I know what he's about to embark on. ♪ New York ♪ ♪ New... ♪ [Klitschko] I totally feel him. I've been there, I've done that. I totally feel the man and... It's like a mirror of myself. [Joshua] Let's rock and roll. [woman] All right, guys, so, you can all follow me, we're gonna go on the set. [Joshua] About a minute, it's all business. But when we're exchanging blows, man, it gets more personal. [woman] We're going to do a tease. [Joshua] That respect goes out of the way. [presenter] Guys, thanks so much for joining us. Great to see you, finally. -[Joshua] Great to be back. -[presenter] Great to see you, sir. -Good to see you, too. -Olympic champion. These guys are friends. He actually went to your boxing camp as a young man. [narrator] For 10 years, Wladimir Klitschko was a dominant force in world boxing. The young Anthony Joshua spent time in his camp learning from the master. But since Klitschko's shock defeat to Britain's Tyson Fury, the former champ is now the challenger. Anthony is his route back to the top, via a 30-million-pound mega fight. [Hearn] Thanks to everyone who has turned out today. It's a pleasure to be here. And it's a pleasure to be involved with a fight I believe is the biggest fight in British boxing history. [Klitschko] I'm fighting a man that I, was, is, and would be fan of. We had plenty of rounds during sparring sessions 2014, when Anthony was my sparring partner. I believe this man has a lot of skills. But how's he going to feel if he's going to get hit again, again, and again, again, and again? Considering your opposition so far, do you feel that this could be too much too soon? I'm here for a reason, and I'll handle business the same way I've been handling business. The objective still remains the same, and that is to be victorious. I think it's the perfect time for both of us. In three years he's gonna be too good, and then I'm gonna be too old, maybe. But this is the time and we just got it in the right time. And it's definitely a signature fight for boxing. [man] OK, we're going to pose for some photos. If you guys come up. [photographer] Just the two fighters, please, first, in the middle. -Yeah. -[man] OK, thank you. Step back. [photographer] Face each other first, please, gentlemen. -You did well. And you... Respect. -Same... [photographer] OK, thank you, gentlemen. -Good, see you in Cologne. -Be safe. [fan] Picture, please. Thank you so much, man. I've been waiting for you to come to the U.S. -[Joshua] Oh, yeah? How's everything then? -[fan] Yeah. Good, man. I love you, man. [fan] I missed work today just to come to see you, man. Swear down. Swear down. Are we in a rush? -Can we give him a photo? -Little bit of a rush, yeah. Maybe a quick photo of you. -I'm a man of the people, bro. -Do it quickly, though. -[Joshua] Where you from? -Watford. -[Joshua] Watford, yeah? -[woman] Thank you. [Joshua] He's a personal photographer, him. [laughing] [man] Shall I come on the other side? [presenter] Ladies and gentlemen, we present, - Anthony Joshua. -[Joshua] Take care, yeah? [narrator] Born in Watford to Nigerian parents, Anthony Joshua's teenage life nearly ran off the rails. But the boxing gym proved his savior. In 2009, he was held on remand in Reading Gaol. By 2012, he'd won gold at the London Olympics. And his professional career is flying. [commentator] Oh, nailed him. That's the right hand. I'm quite sure you can do it, turn his head around easily. -[laughing] -[man] Oh, man. All right. [commentator] The right hand lays him out! Beautifully timed by Anthony Joshua! [man] Fucking hell. [laughing] [commentator] That's what the fuss is about. [narrator] Articulate. Handsome. Explosive. The public flock to see him fight. But as his fame grows, his friends help him stay humble. Eddie Hearn, more than a promoter, he guides AJ's career in the ring. Pleasure. Absolute pleasure. [narrator] He makes the fights happen. Freddie Cunningham, Anthony's manager. Leon Skinner, a.k.a. Skins, the life and soul of the crew. Ben Ileyemi, the cousin who introduced Josh to the gym. And David Ghansa known as KD, or King, Anthony's right-hand man. Our cameras have been with Anthony Joshua for two years, offering an intimate insight into the life of a fighter. The journey to Klitschko starts here, at the O2 arena. A British title fight against an old foe, Dillian Whyte. [Joshua] Me and Dillian have got history from 2009. We boxed as amateurs and it was my third fight. He was experienced, he was a better fighter than me at that time. So, he did beat me, but he was always talking like, "You may have won your gold medal but just remember that we're waiting round the corner for you when you turn pro." [man] Come on, Josh, let's go, mate. [Joshua] And then I would bite back now and again on social media and I think it was time to settle it fair and square. [presenter] Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble! I spoke to you both in the dressing room, you both know what I expect. Keep it clean, break straight away when told. Both watch your heads in close, good luck to you both. Touch gloves. [Joshua] It's not always going to be clean and clinical, sometimes you need to get down and dirty. No matter what type of fight it is, I'll stick it out until I can't anymore. It was about pride. [commentator] Seconds out, first round. [Joshua] And it turned out to be a barnstormer. [crowd cheering] -[man 1] All right, yeah... -[man 2] Let him through. -[man 1] I'll go and find out. -[man 2] Yeah, he's coming back in now. [indistinct chatter] [Joshua] Frankie Z? -[Joshua] Was that all right? -Bruv. Yeah, I'm acting. [commentator] Joshua wants revenge for that defeat in the amateurs. [Joshua] When the bell went, I said, "Come to fight. Come on, let's war." [commentator] Joshua sticks his tongue out at Whyte. Whyte in survival mode here already. -Talkin' to him on the way from Detroit. -Too much talking to him, by the way. Talking is not good. -It's an adrenaline exit. -Yeah, it is. No, I'm just telling him. I said-- He threw a jab, I said, "That's shit," he threw a left hook, I said, "You're going to have to do better than that." [Joshua] When me and him come together, it's just a pub fight. I'm not backing down from no one. [commentator] That was Joshua hitting after the bell. Whyte's not having any of it. Whyte's lost control. Whyte has lost control completely. Now, what's happening here, everybody's in the ring. [Joshua] Who jumped into the ring in the invasion? Did you jump in? [indistinct chatter] Are you mad? Bro, bring it in. [talking over each other] Going, you do not touch... Take back that hoodie. Hold me back! [crowd cheering] [Joshua] The second round, I got caught. It was my own fault. I tested myself. -[commentator 1] He shook Joshua! -[commentator 2] Joshua's hurt. [commentator 1] Joshua is in big trouble! Massive turn around here! Whyte going for it! [Joshua] And you just have to dig deep and find that character within yourself. I was like... [Joshua play acting] [laughing] [man] "Who hit me?" [Joshua] I was like, "Who hit me?" [laughing] I was like, "Shit!" Ding, ding, ding. Thank fuck for that! [crowd chanting] [commentator] He's breathing hard again after that body shot. He's being dragged into something here. [Joshua] How else am I gonna stop these body shots? Every other round... Bang! Bang! [man] Bodyslams you... -[Joshua] Bruv, he's snatching my soul. -[man] His God's in the body fuckin' slam. [commentator] Tagged there with a beautiful right-hand counter. [crowd cheering] And again, Joshua can't shift him. -I'm hurting him but not enough. -[man] Yeah. 'Cause I kept on going, bang, bang! So, that's why I fought, "Motherfucker." So, that's why this time I went round that way. [crowd cheering] [commentator] He's got him. Finally got him. Is this the breakthrough? I had enough power to hurt him but I was loading up too much. And that's learning, that's why you need the rounds. [commentator] There's a grin from Whyte but the legs are betraying him and down he goes. It's stopped! It's over! [crowd cheering] [Joshua] I never jump on the ropes and get excited after a win. But that fight meant a lot. I fought Dillian's fight and still beat him. I really wanted to prove to everyone, no matter what you say, I'm the man to be reckoned with. I'm ready to fight again. -[laughing] -No, I need to learn, that's what it is. I need to learn. People grow up doing this shit. -Anything can happen in that ring... -[man] You know, it's OK. [narrator] March 2016, Anthony Joshua is the British heavyweight champion. But he lives at home in his mum's North London flat. And after less than three years as a pro, an even bigger prize is on the horizon. [Joshua] These are the shorts I fought in to compete for the British title. Not too long, not too baggy, I like them quite classy. And the red is like Klitschko. Klitschko uses red a lot of the time. But I went to the Ali exhibition on the weekend, and I saw them, old school shorts that were, you know, like, right up their thighs, they was in long robes, and I've asked my designer to make a robe for me as well, 'cause I always do like the classical, the real old-school style of fighting and so on. So I might do something different. I first started boxing in 2008. November 2008, I had my first fight. 2010, was building, fighting. Eleven, I was at the World Championships, Baku, a year before the Olympics, competing for Great Britain. And I managed to secure myself an Olympic qualifier and a silver medal in a real tough fight. A few months later, you know, I'm representing the country in London. You know, I haven't been boxing for long, it's a bit crazy. But I manage to stand myself on the number-one podium at the Olympics, and secure the super-heavyweight Olympic championship medal. What I done in 2012 has spurred me on to 2016. I'm fighting for the championship belt of the world after 15 pro fights. These belts here, as a professional, are leading me to the heavyweight championship of the world. [narrator] Charles Martin has won the IBF world heavyweight title and chooses to fight Joshua next. Such is Anthony's commercial power, the American bucks tradition and agrees to face him in London. -The winner takes all. -Go. Fifteen pound on the line. -Got it. -Lets' go. One, two, three! No way. [Joshua] You're only as good as the company you keep. And the company I keep are very motivated people, and they keep me in check. One, two, three. Yes! [laughing] [Joshua] Are you here to pick up someone? Your knee. [narrator] For heavyweight fighters, there is no upper weight limit. No dieting. No nervous moments on the scales. The weighing is a chance to show the world you're ready. The atmosphere this time round feels different. -There's something different in the air. -It's calm. -'Cause we know. -Chilled out. Preparation's been good. I can't wait for our boy to handle business. Cheese! [man] Stop pulling your hand away, bruv! -Yeah, you're not allowed to do that. -They're meant to be interlocked, bruv. [Joshua] Today is the day of the IBF heavyweight championship of the world. I woke up feeling fresh, know what I mean? Had a great sleep. Had a lovely breakfast with me and the boys. They're like family to me. I feel great, I feel loose. -What one? -[man] Black one. Nah, white. [Joshua] What we wanna do is, make it as much as a chill out as possible, so you're not just sat in your hotel room on your own, locked away in the dark. You know, you just want to have fun, enjoy people's energy. take it all in, recharge yourself. -[woman] White shorts. -White shorts or dark? So I'll wear the white shorts, white boots, with this on top. -[man] Yeah, yeah. -You agree? [indistinct chatter] No, white's better. Black is dench, white is clean. White? Yeah, like when you step out, black is-- It's a dark place anyway. -[man] Yeah, white-- -When you step out, it's just like, "Oh, black, the usual." When it's a white long gown and you step out, and you just... come out like an angel, like. -[man 1] Hand up for black. -[man 2] Hand up for black. Hand up for black. -Black. -Hand up for white. [cheering] [Joshua] Nice, man. It's nice. [crowd cheering loudly] All right, I'll see you in a bit. [man] Good luck, Josh! -[presenter] Seconds out, first round! -[bell tolls] [commentator] This is the coming of age of Anthony Joshua. Joshua always starts fast. Both of them have got rid of a lot of opponents early. There is the right hand from Joshua. He senses that Martin felt that. [indistinct shouting] He got him. Right hand, on the floor! Martin looks into his corner as if to say, "What on earth was that?" [crowd cheering] Now he's looking at the referee. He is drawing a breath here, taking every second he can. But Joshua has had him on the floor and there's still a minute 40 left in this second round. And he's done it again! And Joshua on the brink here, strolls into the corner, as if to say, "Job done." Over, done! Britain has a new world heavyweight champion! -[Leon] Emotions are going everywhere. -[man] Speechless. I don't even know what to say. Happy. Just happy. It's crazy. The power, ridiculous, we knew Martin wasn't going to last that long. We were thinking, obviously, round three or four, but round two... He just caught him nicely. Too much power, number one, IBF. [Joshua] How are you doing, sir? Nice to see you. How are you? You well? It was quick. -It was quick. -But the weeks of hard work... [Joshua] How's things on your side? -All good. -Good man, good man, good man. -Did you enjoy? -Yeah. -Do you come to many boxing events? -No, first time. -First time? -I came for you. [laughing] [Joshua] People wanna see blood, huh? Send me that. -I'm gonna send it to you. -Yeah. Firstly, we'll have a round of applause for the new heavyweight champion of the world. IBF heavyweight champion of the world. How does that settle on your ears? IBF heavyweight champion of the world? Quarter of the way there, man. Nice. All right. [indistinct noise] Yeah. What a day, cuz. [commentator] ...world heavyweight champion! [narrator] The new champion attracts ever greater media interest. Anthony joins up with his friend, Watford footballer Troy Deeney, for a TV shoot. It's time to talk history. [man] OK, everyone's phones are on silent, please. -[Joshua] Yeah. -Everyone's got their phones on silent? Thank you. OK. OK, when you're ready. Thanks, guys. This was a tribute to Ali, right, if I remember correctly? [Joshua] That's right, man. I didn't know, it's a little bit of snakeskin. -[Joshua] You know how we do. -[Deeney laughing] [Joshua] These are the actual gloves. I fought Charles Martin, as well, so if you need these, these are going for about 500 a pop. I could give you these for your memorabilia room. [laughing] -[Deeney] Retro, isn't it? I like it. -[Joshua] Yeah. I can see some proper gold there. -[Joshua] Yeah. -It, actually, looks like it's been used, it hasn't just been put in a case. I went to train with the former world champion, Klitschko, and he was telling me he put his gold medal in the Ukrainian museum. -OK. -A lot of people keep it locked away, -in his personal possessions. -Yeah. But he's put his out there, so when people go there from his home town, they can see what he achieved and say, "You know what, I want to go on to do what he has," and so on and so forth. [Joshua] I know what this represents. My good days. When I was younger, I was still smoking, I was still partying. I was getting in trouble. I was having court cases. And I carried on bricklaying. And this was the time when I was thinking, "What am I going to do with myself?" So, obviously, I'd found boxing 'cause I was boxing at the time while I was on bail. I was boxing, 'cause my cousin took me. I remember once, I got an opportunity to go to Vegas to fight and it was like, I was telling -my site manager-- -Yeah, yeah. "Listen, I'm going to go to Vegas. I'll be back in two weeks. Sweet, I'll see you in two weeks." And he was like, "No, you are not here and you're not getting paid, then, someone else can come in and take your job, so, listen, you choose what you're gonna do." And I ended up going to Vegas. The old punching machine. There we go. [Deeney] Seven nine seven. Can we just do some keepy-uppies or something like this? [Joshua] Oh, yeah. [laughing] -He got nervous. -I was like, "No." [Deeney] That was really nice. Seven nine five. I'm happy with that, but I can take a 15% loss to you. -Oh, my! -I think you broke it. All right, I actually think he broke it. No problem. Nothing's happened. [narrator] The world of the champ is changing. With fame comes a taste of life in the fast lane. [Joshua] Right here, we got some snake skin leather. This ain't no ordinary leather. These rugs are imported all the way from Africa. You know, straight off a lion's back, so this ain't no ordinary rug, so, if you don't mind, remove your shoes. -[fan 1] Anthony! -[fan 2] Anthony! [narrator] There aren't many household names left in boxing. But in a few short years, Anthony's profile is exploding. The public, media, brands, all want a piece of AJ. But it's part of the game, and he takes it all in his stride. [photographer] Straight ahead. This way, this way. And back to the left, Anthony, please. [exhaling] What are these? [laughing] [man] Hello. Good to see you around. -[Joshua] Hi, there. Nice to meet you. -[man] Mariano's our photographer. [Mariano] Yeah. Pretty excited. -How's things, mate? -Good, just finished training. I was saying to Andy, "Mate, we've got a week before the shoot and he's posting pictures of him eating apple pie and ice cream." I'm like, "What's going on?" [laughing] You guys can do all the Photoshop, right? [laughing] You can change stuff for me. A computer can only do so much, you know what I mean? You are the first British man to be on our cover -twice within 12 months. -Serious? -We're making history. -Yeah. Is Ali a reference for you? -[Joshua] If I was a photographer, yeah? -[Mariano] Yeah. [Joshua] 'Cause he took some really nice pictures. This ain't just for me, this is, like, for boxers after. If there was no Ali, there would be no me. So it is good to do these things, 100%. But it definitely has, like, a good knock-on effect in my industry and stuff as well. That's not just about me. [Mariano] Look at us. Look at us. Thank you. Amazing. Amazing. [man] Looking good, man. [Joshua] Character is important. Being in front of the camera so much, if it's all fake people will soon figure out. You know what I mean? So, just be yourself, man. [Mariano] Ah! Amazing! Amazing! [indistinct chatter] [Mariano] A few more of them. [Joshua] A close-up? I don't find it so bizarre because I'm really tuned in to what they're trying to achieve. [man] Lean back on the wall. Take the gloves. [Joshua] These guys are here to do a job. They're catering for what they need, what I need, so I appreciate what they're doing. [Mariano] Thank you, everybody! [applause and cheering] Thank you. The only time, it gets a bit hard is if you're tired, that's all. Other than that it's good, it's fun. [man] Man, this is gonna be a tough edit. That looks good, too. That's cool. Smile, man. Winner... Such a good guy. Thank you. Give me your hand. Don't leave him hanging. All good? [man 1] Let's get the music, guys. Music, music, music. [man 2] Did you guys get what you needed? [narrator] Just two months after winning the world heavyweight title, Anthony already has a new fight to promote, with a little help from Hollywood star, the Rock. -Champ! -What's going on? Good to see you, brother. -Good to see you. -All right, good to see you. Champion of the world, big fight coming up. -June 25th. -June 25th. -First title defense. -First title defense. Right. Again it's another American guy. What's gonna be your strategy for the fight? I'm gonna share a little bit with you guys, -I'm not gonna share everything but-- -Yeah. Some of the most important tactics of how to defeat Breazeale. I'm going to have to come in slipping, feinting. You want to stay off the line so shots can be slipping past you, so. Imagine you throw a jab. Another jab. -Oh, yeah. -And then you're in. A pleasure, brother. Thank you for having fun. God bless you. You have a great fight. -Appreciate it. -Big Showtime partnership, first time in the States. He is the man. [applause] How's things, anyway? Everything good? Everything's good, yeah. Yeah. Everything's good. You know, it's like... The biggest thing is just trying to... balance everything. Like, if you just had a baby. -Yeah. -I had a baby as well. -You did? When? -Yeah, man. -Seven months ago. -Wow, ours is six and a half. -What's your boy's name? -Joseph. -And your baby girl's name? -Jasmine. -Jasmine. And... -Yeah. -And your... -Simone. -Simone. -Yeah. You're going to find with Joseph... 'Cause you're already inspired to, motivated to train and work, get better and better and leave a legacy, -because of him, that's a whole new level. -Yeah, man. You'll love him. 'Cause then you're not fighting for yourself, know what I'm saying, it's for him. [narrator] Back to business. A first defense of his new title against American, Dominic Breazeale. Two grueling 12-week training camps back to back have taken their toll. But in boxing, there are no excuses. Joshua has a fight to win. You're killing me, Doc. [man] What are y'all doing in here? What up, Ray-Ray? [Joshua] What you got for me, boy? You know, I went to Burberry and got some stuff, you know. You got some Burberry? For Little JJ, you know. I bought some Hugo Boss pants. [laughing] -[Joshua] These are for JJ? -Yeah, bro. My G! 11:00 p.m., what time you going to be done? Here, smile. You need to sleep in an hour. -You've done your job. -[doctor] Relax. -Man, I want to sleep. -[man] We're getting up again, -training at 6:00 in the morning. -Relax. [Joshua] That shit crazy. [indistinct chatter] [man] Did you train or did you pretend to do training? [laughing] That man shows me respect in Sheffield, you know. I told you, bruv, when you're out of Sheffield-- Down here, it's a different thing.

[indistinct] Ready? All right, let's go in. [Joshua] Which way are we going? [man] Breathe, relax, breathe, breathe, breathe. We arrived, it's all chilled out. The time goes on. -We don't get nervous. -Never. Cool, calm, collected. We're ready. The time's going to come, we're all going to the KO show. Boom! [indistinct chatter] Don't show him.

I'm just going to walk forward with a smile on my face, and not worry about anything. [presenter] Let's get ready to rumble! [Joshua] The nerves kick in for me when I step in the ring. Every fight can be your last fight. And every fight's a risk. [narrator] A member of Anthony's entourage films the fight from ringside, providing a closer look at the reality of life in the ring. [crowd cheering] [man] Hands up! [man] Yes! [man] Attaboy! [indistinct shouting] [crowd cheering and applauding] [man] Can't keep up... [Joshua] You train for, like, three months. Then I had two weeks off, which was work. It weren't even like I was chilling out with the family, then straight back in camp. So to get Dominic out of there was, like, a relief, that I can finally have a bit of rest. -Josh! -Josh! [Hearn] He needs a long rest now. Just go and sit on a beach with his mates and mess around, because he's been absolutely relentless. [man] Our man can take a shot, huh? Fucking hell. I'm tired. And I'm tired as well. Please, man, just fuckin' go down. I've not seen him this happy after a fight, not because of his performance, but 'cause he knows it's over. He knows now that he can have his rest, and it's much, much, much needed. [narrator] Time for some fun. Rio style. Anthony heads to the Olympics, mixing work, with pleasure. [crowd cheering] You saw that as well. No, just kidding. Got you. The best man! [narrator] Anthony and his team have learned from experience, that rest and relaxation between fights is key. But playtime is over. And the serious business is about to start. A second defense of his title with one interested observer ringside. [indistinct shouting] [commentator] Joshua, like a predator. He's going hunting and he's going hunting down. Right hand flattens Eric Molina! Who is slumped in his own corner. [Joshua] This is a huge fight. [presenter] Tonight is as good a time as any to announce what's next. I'd like to officially announce, Anthony Joshua against Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium on April the 29th for the unified heavyweight championship of the world. [Klitschko] I do enjoy the place where I'm at as a challenger, because I have to do more, instead of just defending the titles. Do you want to see a big fight? [crowd cheering] I don't hear you. [crowd cheering louder] [Klitschko] I just have this one shot. One kill. [narrator] Twelve weeks till Klitschko. Time to head to camp. But, first, there's somebody Anthony wants to see. This morning, we're here to meet Sean Murphy, a close friend and the guy who started me off boxing in 2008. I know this place like the back of my hand. I used to come running round here, and right now, we've got a little surprise for Sean. So I'm just heading down to the boxing gym. -[Joshua] What's up there, Sean? -[Murphy] Are you all right, mate? -I'm tired. -I'm fine, man. -I can't be too noisy in the day. -Huh? -I'm not a morning person. -You're up every morning early. Every morning. -How are you? -All right. [Murphy] I don't know what it was about him. He was a very happy-go-lucky sort of fella. He was just laughing all the time. I thought he was on crack or something. Sean, shut up! Get on the bag! Stop talking! I would come in here and think it's a social club. I did my boxing, but I still had a laugh with the boys and that. And this is where I learned discipline, where you have to... forget your ego and listen to instructions if you want to achieve something. Sam who's just coming in, Sam Patrick, that was Josh's training partner. He's seen me in my reckless days. When I was smoking. And then boxing really helped me get on the straight and narrow. Keep your chin down, mate. You know, deep down, I'm a shit boxer, innit? Deep down, I'm the shit... I still ain't got a Scooby-Doo. I've just been blagging it the whole time. -Your mum rang me up once. -Yeah. I don't know if I've ever told you this or she might have told you. Do you remember you was coming for a little while? Yeah. And then, all of a sudden, you disappeared. Remember what I said to you? I said, "Whatever you are doing, it is not legal." Oh, my God. I said, "You have got to stop it now. If you want to get serious and you want to box, you have got to stop it now, -and sort yourself out." -Stay focused, yeah. [Joshua] This is Klitschko. -That's Klitschko there? -Yeah. I've got something for you in the car, as well, Sean. Look at that. [Murphy] "Finchley ABC, Sean--" What the fuck, man? That's your motor. -This is your life. -Fuck off. -I'm serious. -Honestly? -Yeah, man. -I'd be scared to drive it. There's a little contract on it that you can't sell it in six weeks. [Murphy] I remember Josh saying to me a long time ago, "I'll look after you," -but you don't expect it. -[woman] So good to his word. Him just winning the world title is enough for me. Do you know what I mean? Josh, somebody's going to have to show me how to fucking start it. [Joshua] These guys will always have their doors open for me, no matter what. [Murphy] What have we got to do with this? When it's all said and done I'll never forget, who's been there when no one was. [Joshua] Forward. Push it forward. [cackling] [Murphy] I can't believe it, man. This is too nice. Thank you. [Joshua] Come on, it's all good. [Murphy] Inside I'm fucking jumping up and down, you know what I mean? [Joshua] Don't worry about nothing. This is just something off my own chest. There will be a lot more to come. Don't worry about that. I was fucked before boxing, man. Trust me, man. [dogs barking] [Joshua] Right, lads, this is Sheffield, innit? We've got two sessions back-to-back early, so... I like my rest, so I need to start earlier so I can get back earlier. For me, it's now I'm fighting Wlad, everything that I've done over the last three years has, kind of, built me up till now. So, I've found out who I am, what I need to do, what works, what don't work. And I just put it into action now. [hip-hop music] -Straight in? -[trainer] Give yourself a minute? [Joshua] No one tells me what I have to do. No one puts a gun to me saying, "You have to be a boxer." It's my choice. [grunting] -[Joshua] Five or six? -[trainer] One more, one more. Six. [trainer] Perfect, mate. Whoo! [Joshua] Every morning you wake up, you have to give a bit of yourself to the gym. [grunting] [trainer] Come on, three more. [Joshua] This is reality. This is where the hard work gets put in. [trainer] Two more, mate. Big squeeze in the back. One more. [groaning] [Joshua] Sheffield's where it's at right now. No one disturbs me. I've trained at home, it's not a problem. But when I weigh 'em up, getting away from home balances out a bit better for my... for my discipline and stuff like that. [grunting loudly] Going into 2011 is when I came up here. A lot of good fighters pass through Sheffield on the amateur system, to make their journey through to become world champions. It's phenomenal. It's a phenomenal place. And I wouldn't change it for the world. [groaning] Just trying to embrace the hard work and the fun of it. [trainer] Come on, mate, four more. I'm done with the complaining. It's painful, don't get me wrong, but... I've got to enjoy it. No stresses, no stress. [straining] [trainer] Two, rest. Well done. Now you're done. [Joshua] So, now, eat, chill out for a bit, half an hour. Hour nap and I get back in the gym again. Then do some sparring. This ain't easy. What's happening, people? A day in the life of AJ. Welcome to the crib. This is how we live. Excuse the messy rooms but it's real life. Here we have my homeboy, King David. He comes to camp with me. So I've got my food already ready for the day. It's just been cooked so I'm letting it cool down. Got some beef here, got some pasta. Got some boiled eggs. It's not paradise but I think for me right now when I'm in training camp, it keeps my feet on the ground. I'm just here to do a job and I just need somewhere, anywhere, to rest my head and this is perfect for me right now. [Hearn] If it rains, we are fucked. -It's a long ring walk, as well. -Yeah. It's going to take him four, five minutes, total. If it's pouring with rain, -we go straight down there. -Brilliant. Yeah. Straight from here to the ring. The ideal plan is he goes under the stage, comes up. You have those flaming letters. [Freddie] I always think of lasers. -He doesn't want to do lasers. -Really? -No. -They always look good. Klitschko doesn't like lasers. The core group and the core team has been exactly the same for years now. Does he know his music yet? Let's see if I can get him on Skype. He looked at us, we were 28, 29, 31, the main guys around him. Everyone looked, going, "You're a bit young." And he said, "Yeah, you are, but you guys are going to learn." Can you help on Skype for two secs? Mate, you've got to get in shape if you're going to beat Klitschko. [laughing] I've just got a bit of a tan, mate. How's the operation running, guys? I've never seen a man take something in his stride more. Like, anything. How's it all going? Not too bad. I had a good rest this weekend. Listen to this, I was in the gym yesterday, and some old guy came up to me and was like, "I was in Wembley with my wife, and your face came across the LED screen." And he goes, "You looked like you had seen better days, mate." [loud laughter] I swear to you, he said, "That picture don't do you no justice." Change that. From the day that we started working with him, just as he turned professional, he's the same Anthony Joshua. [Freddie] Let's talk about your ring walk music. Have you had any thoughts? [Joshua] Honest, I haven't. [Bell] The landscape's changed and there are sponsors and there are TV ads, but he's the same man. [Hearn] The weigh-in, could be at Wembley Arena. It could be, like, nine or ten thousand people. Do we charge, one pound entry for charity? If you could do that, that's really good. [man] There's charities linked to boxing. Yeah, something like that. Or even if you had a charity box on entry. Yeah. What you see is what you get. A hardworking guy who's made it from the bottom all the way to the top. I'll take you on a little tour around the crib. [Hearn] Looks quite nice in there. These chairs ain't no ordinary chairs, these are vintage chairs. [laughing] [Hearn] We talk a lot, generally about rubbish, just laughing. But camp is a dark, horrible place and he needs that release sometimes. [Joshua] Look at this. This is my inspiration right here. It's even got "champ" written on it! [laughing] [Hearn] You can imagine he gets off that call speaking to us, and he feels good again, he feels refreshed. [Joshua] Thank you for your time. -[man] Peace -See you later. [Joshua] Bye, all the best. [man] See you later, bye. God, he's so arrogant, that guy. Oh, shit, sorry, mate, sorry! [everyone laughing] See you later. You lot are so dumb. -It's a tough fight. -Yeah. Tough fight. [Hearn] This is Klitschko's 29th world title fight. This is Anthony Joshua's 19th fight. It's the young lion. And one of the legends of the heavyweight division. Can Joshua handle the power? Can Joshua deal with the experience? Klitschko has been unbelievable. Sparring, great footwork, looked really good, fresh, happy. That's why, when everybody sits down in their seats at Wembley Stadium, when everybody's on their armchair at home waiting for that first bell to ring... no one knows what's going to happen. [machine whirring] [bell ringing] [Joshua] Second session of the day. Probably, get in around ten rounds of sparring. [trainer] Nothing tight. [grunting loudly] [trainer] Too square, Josh. Come on, relax a little bit. [Joshua] I've been out of the ring for a couple of months, and then it's, like, I come in as a complete novice. [grunting] -[trainer] Too tight. -[Joshua] My timing's out. [trainer] Legs and feet, balance, upper body. Elbows in. He's just starting to get his sharpness back. He's starting to get a bit of a rhythm back. So when you throw a jab or a straight shot, if you fall in or rush it, they'll catch you with a hook. Do it again, come on. [Joshua] If it was easy, I'd come in four weeks before my fight and just punch a bag, pads, and I'd be ready, but it's not that simple. Good, and again. [Joshua] Over time at the camp, you start improving and getting it right. [trainer] Well done, good, good, that was a good finish, that was. [Joshua] By fight time, you just do stuff naturally. You'd won't even know that you've slipped that and thrown it. -I'll take your head guard off. -OK. It's hard work, isn't it? [Joshua] Keep on plugging away week in, week out, and by fight week, I should be sharp and ready. Good, that's a nice shot. And again. Anthony's greatest strength is his belief. Good, nice, now even smoother and sharper. He'll go as far as you tell him he could go and he'll give it everything. It's a fascinating fight cause Klitschko's been the dominant heavyweight for so long. You could question if he is the force he was after Fury beat him. [grunting] -Where's my defense? -Sorry. [trainer] One loss doesn't suddenly make you a bad fighter. Right hand. [Joshua] All right, I'll get it. [trainer] We've seen it time and time again where somebody's had a loss, and then came back even better than they were and they'd learned from that. Right hand? Good. This is a real test. -[bell ringing] -Good shot. [Joshua] Are we doing another one? Just watch you don't tighten up. Don't hold your breath. Relax. Relax, keep off the line. Nice and composed. OK? -Nice and relaxed. It's not a race. -OK. Nice and calm. [narrator] From Sheffield to Klitschko's back yard. The Ukrainian is now based in Germany and interest there is huge. It's a final chance to promote the fight. [interviewer] Anthony, welcome to Cologne. So, you are the champion. What is your plan in Wembley? To, naturally, let everything I've been practicing in training camp happen. In Germany, you're out really early, came straight from Sheffield last night. Had a busy week in camp. Got the press conference later, with Wladimir. Wladimir Klitschko. Do you think that Klitschko is a little bit frightened of this fight? No. And he's had a long break. Maybe it's done him good, maybe it hasn't. Hey, you stay hungry there. [Joshua laughing] What are you eating there? Huh? You're not telling me the secrets. That's really gonna look bad. [Joshua] Are you saying that my T-shirt is too slim? [David] It's become very real to Klitschko. Anthony is not just a young... person who is coming up in his shadow. It's like really stay hungry. I'm eating too much right now. [David] The reality has not set into him that, he's not the boss of this. [Joshua] This is the stage of the fight where it's all about the mind. This is the mind game, period. [Klitschko] I believe this fight is going to be the most important fight in my career. I am obsessed with my goal to become three-time world champion. [presenter] Anthony Joshua. [cheering and applauding] [Klitschko] There's only two men fighting against each other. There is no other things that can help you. It's all about you. [Joshua] I don't think I'll crumble, I think I'll rise to the occasion. Pressure, I'll turn it into a positive. [Klitschko] Experience is something that you cannot just write off. [Joshua] If it's experience, I have lost already. I'm not the finished article but I know where I'm going. -[Joshua] Good to see you, man. -[Klitschko] Good to see you. -Say hello to your brother, as well. -Yes. [narrator] April, 2017. Camp is almost over. Anthony Joshua stands at the crossroads of his young career. [panting] He has traveled the road to Wladimir Klitschko, and is just a few weeks away from his ultimate test. [Joshua] I feel I'm confident. When you first come into camp, you're not fit but I'm feeling better about myself. Whoo! [David] We knew this was the level that he's going to reach, and I'm not nervous 'cause, I see the work that goes in. -Even longer. -Even longer? [trainer] The world's watching and AJ is going to deliver. That's a good stop. He's incredibly fast, he's incredibly strong. Seriously powerful and very talented. Klitschko will have to be something special at this stage in his career to send Anthony off. Beautiful. And again. [Joshua] I didn't think we was ever going to meet but now we are competing. He's just another man that's in the way of where I'm trying to go. He's got something to prove, he says he's obsessed with winning, so mentally, he seems strong. And I think I should be fighting the best Klitschko. Which is good for me because, when I beat him, there'll be no complaints. [Hearn] This is the most riskiest, most dangerous sport you could ever find. And anything could happen. In heavyweight boxing, someone lands a shot, it's all over. It doesn't mean you're not good enough, doesn't mean you've got a weak chin. It's just heavyweight boxing. [man] Feeling all right? [Joshua] It's a lonely sport. It's all good to have a laugh and joke, and walk to the ring with 15 people, [grunting] but ultimately everyone steps out and it's just left down to you and your opponent. It's just me and him. We know he's an elite fighter. [Hearn] Can he go on and be a great? [bell ringing] [Joshua] Klitschko is a man who is quite tall, uses his height well. Dips his chin rather than his whole torso. He likes to stay relaxed, and maneuverer his opponent with the left hand, like a smokescreen, and he keeps you at bay. Stay there. Stay there, stay there, bang. Hoping for the knockout. With someone like Klitschko, just stay off the line. Little head movement. And off the line, I mean, if there's a line there, stay off it. Speed is key. Bam, bam, bam! Put your combos together, and if you are that quick, as they come, bam, bam, bam! You meet them and stop them in their tracks. [Joshua] It's a time when, all those months, that you've been preparing are coming down. And you have to zone in. You have to focus. Because, the fight is upon us, and I'm looking forward to it. [presenter] Ladies and gentleman, presenting the heavyweight fighting pride of England, The IBF heavyweight champion of the world, Anthony Joshua! [man] Are you ready for becoming a legend? No. I don't want to be a legend, no way. [Joshua] When you're a legend, sometimes you have to disconnect yourself from reality, and I don't want to do that. I wanna be with the people. Where you at? Where you at? I'll fight him down. All roads lead to April 29th, Saturday's showdown. I keep hearing is that this is the biggest event in British boxing history. What an event to be involved in, mate. The support has definitely grown. I definitely can see that. Fight by fight. And goes down to the type of fighters I fight. The better the opponent, the more interesting it is. [applause and cheering] Today we had our press conference, where we done a lot of talking. On this USB stick, I recorded a video, my prediction. And the outcome of the fight. There's things I wish I could've said, you always realize what you could've said after the press conference, but it's all good. [presenter] Wladimir knows what going to happen on Saturday night. What do you think happens on Saturday night? I win. I win. No, it's not complicated. It's not complicated. As it gets closer, pressure starts mounting. [presenter] Let's get this party started! [crowd cheering] [Joshua] I'm just trying to stay calm. But, like, sometimes when I'm lying in bed I can't sleep. I'm just, like, thinking about it. I can't wait to perform, it's going to be sick. Let me just... It's just another day. I've got to see it as another day. So, it's like you're constantly in a mental battle, of how you deal with this type of an occasion. [man] AJ. Do you want to say hi to him? Yo, you good? -Someone wants to speak to you. -Oh, shit. Hey. - What's up, brother? -You know how it is. Still grinding. How's the gym going? You still banging weights? Yeah, yeah. I'm joining a training school right after this. [laughing] No, I appreciate that. I was with some friends last night at the studio, we were looking at some of your highlights, man, the most popular saying was, "Oh, shit." [laughing] Yeah, good luck this Saturday, man. - You, probably, won't need it, but... - Yeah. yeah. Big hug for being a massive inspiration. That's mad, you know. Dr. Dre is a fucking legend, bruv. A proper legend. [Hearn] On fight day, there's pullouts in every paper. You know, six, eight page pullouts. I mean, that doesn't happen in boxing. It's the sort of thing that happens when World Cups or European championships are on. That's when it's suddenly really dormant. Tonight's the night. But, he's so relaxed about everything. You know, the one phrase I hear him say a lot is, "No stress." Boxing is tough enough as it is. And if you're not going to enjoy it, you might as well give it up. [laughing] So, I don't think having a little laugh will deter from me have any ambition to go out there and perform. [man] I'm getting a shot of that right now. [laughing] [Joshua] When I'm loose... Looks like the last little MOT, before we take the car on the track. [chuckling] What I'm trying to do is just go with the flow. I'm here. I'm at peace. This is what I've been working for, let's just go out there and have fun. [Joshua] It was a lovely day. Sun was out. I'm in good spirits. Get to Wembley, let me get to focus. Holyfield, I'm like, wow. What a man, what a fighter. You know, he achieved things that were ahead of his time. It's like he's looking at me like, "Whoa, is this guy come here to fight, or is he here as a spectator?" The arena's, probably, pumpin'. And I'm in this changing room where it's quiet. You know, I'm just restin'. A little half an hour's sleep, but my eyes keep on peeping open, because how can you sleep, when you're filled with so much of energy? You're doing your wraps, and the reason why send someone from your team in, is so you oversee that there's no craftiness going on there. There's stories of people putting in metal rods in to their gloves. [man] Can you fist again? Yeah, OK, open up. [Joshua] It's just a way of protecting the fighter. So, he sent in his older brother. I'm just sending my six-foot-nine brother, former three time world champion in, just to inspect your hand wraps. Just another part of the Klitschko mind games. Very, very intimidating. Very clever. When it's done, I stand up look at Vitali's eye, "Yeah, good. You like the wraps? You happy? You sure? Good. Wish your brother good luck." That's it. Switch up. Let's get ready to rock and roll. This position I'm in don't last forever. So, while you're on the journey, enjoy it. Relax. Breathe. [presenter] Ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment we've all been waiting for. Welcome the challenger, Dr. Steelhammer, Wladimir Klitschko! [man] Fifteen seconds to leave, come on. Fifteen seconds. [man] Josh, you know, breathe. But don't let them stop or slow you. Use that speed. [crowds cheering] We just walk out into this wall of energy. [loud cheering] It was like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. So, I can only imagine what he was feeling like, coping with that situation. [Hearn] And sometimes those moments, are just as important, to see how he deals with it. ["Seven Nation Army" by White Stripes] [crowd echoing song] I get on the stage now, and I start, you know, floatin'. All I can see is like, five Ukrainian flags, Vitali and Wladimir standing there waiting and I'm thinkin', this would wind me up. I'm waiting to fight and this geezer's got AJ up in flames, fireworks going off. Can't afford to lose tonight. [presenter] Let's get ready to rumble! [crowd cheering] [Joshua] This is what we were training for, for the last eight years. Forget everything else that's goin' on. this is mano-a-mano, this is me and Klitschko, this is about pride. [presenter] From Kiev, Ukraine, Wladimir Klitschko! And his opponent, AJ! Anthony... Joshua! I've had a lot of respect for Klitschko. From years back. So, we touch gloves. Touch gloves, brother. The respect's still there. I walk back. You look left, you look right and behind you everyone gets out, and it's just you left in there with your opponent. So, let's rock and roll. [bell rings] [presenter] The time has arrived, light the touch paper. [Joshua] So, we come out now, checking your balance, I'm in my all white, I'm feeling good. [commentator] Nobody really wants to take the gamble, or take any risks this early on. [Joshua] I realized Klitschko was, hitting my hand. Bang, bang. And years of trainin', he must have built up a lot strength in that arm to be able to knock your hand out of the way. Knock it out of the way, and I realized that, I'm in with someone who's just as strong as me. And who can match me for ability. [commentator] Well, he landed with a right hand there Klitschko. He was having a lot of success with the right hand there early on. [man] Get your hand up! Come on! [commentator] Klitschko good right hand there. And another one. Doubling them up. Lookin' back I think the respect that I had for Klitschko, outside of the ring, I transfered it inside of the ring. I had to get rid of the respect I had for him, and just turn it into a dogfight. [bell ringing] [commentator] Fifth round and only the 49th for Anthony Joshua. And the 363rd for Wladimir Klitschko. And Anthony Joshua, is going for it. In the fifth round and Klitschko's shaken. He's hurt for the first time in 11 years. Big moment for Joshua. And he's cut as well by the left eye. In my heart of hearts I thought to myself, "This is it." I roared to the crowd as if I'd done it, I'm walking off still screaming, the ref, is grabbing me, pushing me to the corner. What I didn't realize is that, Klitschko like a terminator, is rising to his feet, filling himself with a new lease of life, and coming out, to give it his last push. [commentator] He's in danger of falling apart, there's so much time in the round. I've come out thinking this is it, I've swung a right hand, missed. I swing the left hook, I've missed. Klitschko starts fighting back, and I'm like, "Whoa." This ain't what I'm used to, do you know what I mean, but it's not. I can't say, "One sec, Klitsch." You know what I mean. "I'm not used to this, bro. Let me just, kind of, gather myself for a minute." [commentator] A big smile from Joshua that Klitschko's fighting back. With a left and a right, as they go to war. Caught the left hook there Joshua. Is Joshua hurt here? And a hand from Klitschko there. Massive power punches going in. And Klitschko's looking to take Joshua out. The left hand, he's really badly hurt! The Englishman and now he's in real trouble. [bell ringing] And the bell goes. What on earth did that take out of the pair of them? One thing that coach has never taught me, is to take a punch and lie down for 10 seconds, and get up before, the count is over. So, he's never come into the gym with a baseball bat and said, "All right, Josh, what we're going to do today is, smack you round the jaw 10 times, and you're going to lay out and we're going to see if you can get up." You're never taught that so, it's a situation when you're in a fight or flight mode. [commentator] And he knocked Joshua down. And Wladimir Klitschko... and Joshua is going down. The count's at five. Will he make it up? It was a heavier fall than Klitschko's. What I learned about myself is character. What no one can train is, who you are deep down. [commentator] He shakes his head, Joshua. [Joshua] And I think when someone can match you with, punch for punch, power for power, speed for speed, it becomes about who you are and how bad you want it. [commentator] Talking to him there. When I'm talking to Klitschko, I think it's just the fight in me. Just the confidence in me. And just reassure myself that I'm still in the fight. [commentator] He keeps talking, Joshua. I'm just letting him know, "If you let me through this next round, I'm going to knock you the fuck out." [commentator] Joshua on the attack now. Maybe he is recovering. I feel like the danger stage that Joshua's been is gone now. [bell ringing] [trainer] Josh, he's 41 and he's tired. Don't miss the bat. Come on. [presenter] Round 11! So I'm switched on now, because it's taken me 11 rounds to figure out the type of combinations he throws. [bell ringing] [commentator] Big shots at the beginning of the 11th. And Anthony Joshua is now going for it, and Klitschko's got a hold on. So, as he's throwing the right hand, that's come straight out, you either go to the side or under. So, what I've decided to do is try and go under, right hand to the body, then left to the head. But, unfortunately, none of those punches landed. And then out of the blue, when I've gone to the right, to the left, you just naturally rotate, and what comes after is the uppercut. [commentator] Good shot there from Anthony Joshua. So, I'm looking at him thinking, "Oh, is he hurt?" I don't want to waste any energy here. And I can see he's like, trying to old-man me, he's experienced at it. "Yeah, you landed a good punch, son, but you haven't hurt me." But I thought you know what? F this. Bang! Bang! Uppercut, hook, body shot. [commentator] And down goes the tired Ukrainian! He went down, he got back up. I thought this geezer don't want to stay down. Boom! So, I chase him across the ring now. He's dodging it still, he's moving. I can't pin this guy down. So, I've got him on the ropes, uppercut, hook, timber! He's just falling like that. Poof! [commentator] Unbelievable scenes at Wembley! I thought that's it. He's definitely not getting back up. I walk to the corner, I look back, all I see is him standing up in the other side of the ring again and I thought, "Oh, my days." I just knew I wasn't going to let him off the hook again. I had the energy I needed I hit him with another barrage of punches. [commentator] This is great work form Joshua. What fitness, what heart! Klitschko... But the fight has been stopped! Lift off for AJ! [Joshua] He came to fight, but it weren't enough to defeat me. [commentator] What a fight! What a night! What a win! Even though, I was in the fight, I knew that it was a really exciting one. I appreciate him more now, but at the time I just fought, as a really good scrap, actually. [presenter] The winner, now the unified heavyweight champion of the world, AJ, Anthony... Joshua! Everything was bigger than what it was before, so, all it needed was an entertaining fight. When you have two fighters that put all the hype, all the support and all their expectations aside and just say, "This is me and you, we're gonna put our hearts on our sleeve and come and trade it out." I think you get the best competition. And then that's what we produced that night. Just two pure warriors coming together and laying it all on the line.
