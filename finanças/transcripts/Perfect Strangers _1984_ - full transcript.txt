(jazzy music) (steam hissing) (tense music) What's the story? You got something for me or what? (thudding) (grunting) I'm sorry. (gagging) (baby babbles softly) Matthew. What are you doing there? Matthew? What are you looking at? Oh my god! (clattering) Oh baby. It's all right, it's all right baby. You didn't see anything. You didn't see anything and I didn't see anything. (tense music) How old are you? Three years old. If you saw me again would you remember me? I'm not stupid. Do I look retarded? Go on, get outta here. Take off. (suspenseful music) Why are you telling me all this stuff? Jesus, up 'til now you were clean as a baby. Never been picked up, never been fingerprinted, never been photographed. That was why you were so valuable to us. It's no big deal. The kid's an infant. For Christ's sake. Don't you read the newspapers? A whole family in Illinois slaughtered in their own house. Everybody but a two or three year old kid. Then the police psychologist and the FBI get to work on this kid and then you know what, they get a positive ID. Bullshit, bullshit! There's no way you're gonna get a conviction with that kinda evidence. I'm not talking about convictions. You get nabbed as a suspect, you compromise us all. You put our work in jeopardy. The mother didn't even see me. Nobody saw me but the kid. She didn't come out 'til later. She doesn't know anything. I don't wanna know about it either. I won't be seeing you again. (tense pop music) Don't walk on any of the graves. It's bad luck. [Man On Radio] Police still have no leads in the gang men slaying of a big time drug dealer in an alley in Lower Manhattan. Despite intensified efforts by authorities, no witnesses have been found in the brutal stabbing which experts consider to be the work of a professional hit man. The specialist uses a knife instead of a gun to dispatch his victims. The killing has been linked to a series of three other knife murders in the New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia areas. Anyone with information regarding this homicide is urged to call the police hotline at 771-9400. 24 were killed as blasts ripped through a Long lsland fireworks plant today, damaging... (unsettling music) [Woman] You just stick to your story, sweetie. Even if they question you again. You were asleep with the kid and you saw nothing and heard nothing. Why raise a finger to help those bastard cops after the way they treat us, shoving us around. I knew there was something wrong with that apartment when I got it. You know there had to be something or cockroaches or rusty pipes or something like that. Sally, a corpse is worse than cockroaches. You had the best idea, honey, don't volunteer any information. But if you had seen it, would you tell? You mean would I testify? Well, how do you know, I mean maybe somebody had a good reason to kill this guy. I mean what if it was a woman and this guy was screwing her around and she finally decided to put him on ice. Look, it wasn't like that. It wasn't a spur of the moment thing. This guy was lured down an alley and had his throat slit. But if it was a woman, and she had a good reason, like maybe the guy was beating her and the kids, or pumping her full of drugs or making her turn tricks. Would you go pointing the finger at her? Didn't they acquit that woman who shot her husband because he was beating her? They let her walk right out of the court. [Friend] That was not in the State of New York. Anyway it wasn't a woman. How do you know? You saw him, didn't you? Didn't you? I felt him, I mean I heard the footsteps. Sally, you're not dealing with the issue here. I mean let's just suppose it was a woman, a sister. Why does everything have to be a political issue with you? Because when the time comes a lotta guys are gonna have to get what's coming to them. So that's what World War lll is gonna be, the girls against the guys. We're not girls. Okay we're women. You think our only weapon is to withhold sex, don't you? They don't realize that the kitchen they've locked us into, imprisoned us in is full of weapons. Sharp, pointed weapons. (chuckles) No, they wouldn't close their eyes at night if they thought about what we're capable of. [Sally] Well I'm not capable of that. Oh no? What about with Fred? (unsettling music) What if he came back again and tried to take Matthew away. The police wouldn't stop him this time. I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of Matthew. He understands everything you say. Oh he's just a kid, he can't understand me. And all this talk about feminist homicide is really making me crazy. It's dangerous. Let's just settle up. Okay. Hi. (sighs) Just waiting for some son of a bitch to walk in here and ask for my money. I'd blow the bastard away. And what if a woman came in here, would you blast her away too? Hmm, I'd wound the bitch. You got it all worked out. Hey, you're gonna be at the demonstration on Friday, the buses leave promptly at 11:45. So don't be late. I'm not going on those buses. I mean I'm taking Matthew and I, and I'll just get there on my own. Okay, just remember the orientation meeting is on Thursday and they'll have all the literature. (laughing) All right. Okay. Hey, how about a little contribution now that you're loaded. I knew I wouldn't get outta here with my money. What's more important to you than the cause, Sally? I mean you don't want Matthew to grow up in a world that's been poisoned with toxic waste and DTD and God knows what else they put in those rivers. No, I want him to grow up strong and healthy so some woman can stab him or shoot him. (Matthew fusses) Oh, what's the matter. I know, I know. See, you upset him now. You upset him. Oh.

(romantic music) (giggling) (horn honking) Are you lost? The way you've been wandering around I thought you shoulda maybe dropped some bread crumbs behind you so you could find your way home. Obviously you don't know where you're going. I's just sorta looking around, you know. [Sally] See anything you like? Yeah, you know we've been kinda running into each other quite a bit, haven't we? Matthew, this man is lost. I'm kinda lost too. But Matthew knows his way home. He's gonna show us. Matthew? [Sally] He'll show us. Is that where we're going, home? Do you have a home? - Yeah. - Do you have a name? Yep. John. John Ross. See, see how I put my name tag. Well I'll Sal and of course you know Matthew. Yeah, hi Matthew. We're old friends. Are you tired, do you want me to carry him? You want to Johnny to carry you, Matthew? I don't think he minds. Come on Matthew. Whoa. [Sally] Is that all right, honey? Does he always take to strangers like that? I'm bringing him up to trust people until they disappoint him. That's a good way to bring up a kid. You know. How long were you gonna follow me around before you got up the nerve? [Johnny] You spotted me right off, right? Well you don't look like everybody else. What is that, a compliment? I mean weren't you scared? Of what? Some guy following you around the street. Well I knew what you wanted. Oh (scoffs), pretty sure huh? I mean maybe I have a thing for women with kids. Maybe it's a maternal thing, you know. I remind you of your mother? Maybe I kind of miss my mother. You know that late movie, that late show, "The Grapes of Wrath" with Henry Fonda, you know that lady, that chubby actress that played his mother? That's what my mother was like. You know she didn't look like Henry Fonda. But she played the mother really good. That's why every time that picture's on, I like to watch it. You know which one I'm talking about? Well at least you had a mother. That bodes well. How's your father? Yeah, I had a father too. I mean we had a pretty normal family. I had two parents. The only thing is he just sat there and he never really said very much, you know? What about Matthew's father? Oh we're not so old fashioned. I see you still got your ring though. I wear that so guys like you won't approach me on the street. Does he still miss his daddy? He doesn't even know his daddy. Bet you're hard to please. [Sally] No, I'm easy to please. You been pleased lately? Not often. I bet you had offers. You know a lotta people look at me but like your old man, they don't say much. Maybe I scare them. Am I formidable? Do I scare you? I'm bigger than you are. Tell me the truth, is there something about me that scares guys? I don't know, you know you look like you know where you're going, even if you don't. You give off some kinda vibes. Like Mother Earth or something. Maybe 'cause you got the kid with you they think, you look together, you know what I mean? So maybe with Matthew with you they think that you got some guy waiting at home for ya. [Sally] Hey, I carry Matthew with me everywhere for protection, right? (thoughtful music) So why don't you let me walk you home so next time I come and pick ya up I'll know where you live. I don't think so. Why not? You don't know me. Well what could be so terrible that I can't find out? Would you put Matthew in the stroller please? I'll tell you what, you meet me on the corner of La Guardia and Washington Square Park at nine o'clock tomorrow. What's there? (chuckles) You'll find out. (unsettling music) (operatic singing) - Manny. - Hey, Johnny. Hello, Mr. Moletti. How you doing? How are you? You say hello to Mario? Say hello to Sally boy over here. Come here. Say hello to Sal. Yo Sal. Mm hmm. Come here, let me take a look at you. Hey, I'm gonna fix ya up, make ya look nice. Sit down. You know, it helps me to relax. My father cut hair, his father cut hair, and as far as the IRS knows, I cut hair. I appreciate it. I understand we have a little problem. No problem. Then I wish ya hadn'ta told us. So why don't you just rely on my judgment on this one? The kid's a baby for Christ's sake. Not a dog or a cat. He's gonna talk. I'm not arguing with you. But on the other hand, there's no harm in being absolutely secure. Are you doing this to me because I made a mistake? You just said you didn't make any mistake. Well, we all got to clean up our own mess. It's gonna cause problems. I mean look, somebody in the business gets knocked off, who cares, nobody cares. But a kid, a little kid? Kids have accidents. I got three grandchildren of my own. They're always falling down. They're always getting hurt. The two girls are five and nine. Hey Sal, she's 10 years old. He forgot how old his grandchildren are. You're right. It's the girls today that are getting the broken arms. You gotta be careful, don't hurt your face, don't lose an eye or something. You don't know what it is to be a grandfather today. Let me advise you on how to handle this. You go back and ingratiate yourself with this young woman. Pretty soon she starts to trust you with her kid. And then this kid has this unfortunate accident. You're very sorry about it and under the circumstances it's only natural that you go away. Now what's to connect that kid's accident with a gang killing in an alley that nobody knows the kid even saw? You dropped a lotta bombs on kids during the war, didn't you? Yeah. But the kid's in those villages, you gotta do what you gotta do. [Mr. Moletti] So we understand each other. Yes sir. [Mr. Moletti] But you gotta do it, Johnny. The sin has got to be on your head. It's gonna take some time. Hey, you're doing the best you can. That's all we ask. Ah, there ya are. You look very nice. That'll be $5. Hey, and you don't have to tip the boss. Next. (suspenseful music) I wanna give them. Women take back the night. Women unite, take back the night. Here. Don't give any to them. Women unite, take back the night. Candlelight vigil and rally against rape. - I wanna read it... - Come on honey. Get away from the nuts. - Let's go. - Why don't you get off the street, get married? [Woman] Too tired. Oh no, come on. This costs money. (tense music) (engine revs) Matthew? Matthew? Oh, oh maybe he went home. Oh no, no, he couldn't have gone far. Where could, Matthew! Matthew? Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! I can't find him, maybe he's around the corner. Matthew, have you seen a little boy? Matthew! Stop him! Stop him! That guy, damn you! Stop! Fred! Put him down, put him down. I have every right to see him, Sally. No you don't. The courts decided that. It's okay folks, a family affair. You can keep going. I really don't enjoy this. I don't want to through it again. The hell you don't. You lied through your teeth, Sally. You told them all kinds of bullshit. Come on, give him back to me. Just, you're scaring him. Please give him... Maybe it's your shouting that's scaring him. Come on man, give her the kid. - Shut up, get going. - I don't want this to happen. Do you want me to call a cop, - is that what this is about? - Stay out of it. You're gonna, they'll come and you'll just have to go through it all over again. We won't go through it all over again, because you started it the first time. Give him to me, please. The cops are gonna come. [Man] Hey. Oh. Oh there. How I ever thought you coulda loved me. How we ever could've had a child together, it's beyond me. I don't know why you want him. He's a part of me, if you hate me so much. I'll be back for ya, Matthew, this isn't over yet, buddy. Oh right, now you've had your big performance. Everyone is, but I know what you're like when there's no witnesses around. And the show is over. Go away! (cheering) (yelling) (whistle trills) [Woman] Oh look, here comes Mr. Macho. [Crowd] We won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. What's wrong with you, Sally? Going back to guys? [Crowd] We won't be beat and we won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. Two, four, six, eight, we won't be beat and we won't be raped. [Woman] But we will all be safe.

My priority is that the child is tired and I'm going home right now. He can stay... You've just got to come with us. We have so much to discuss. It can wait two days. [Woman] No, it can't wait.

I mean what kinda pervert put the kid on the top of the tree anyway, you know? I mean think about it. The wind's blowing like crazy, it's knocking the cradle around like some kinda canoe on the top of the tree. The kid's terrified. He's about to puke. Because some bastard left him up there in the first place. When the bough breaks. And you know they never put him on just any bough top of the tree, they always gotta put him on the weakest one, you know the one they know is gonna break. (giggling) You know they got an insurance policy on the kid. They go "Oh we'll just put him up there" "for a little fresh air." And then he's all cold. 'Cause his covers fells off. And then the bough breaks, cracking and he knows that he's gonna fall 40 feet to the pavement below. That's the best part. And down'll come baby. Cradle and all. (Sally giggles) (romantic music) That's supposed to be a nursery rhyme, not child porn. And you know the thing is, listening to stuff like that is a hell of a lot more harmful to him than a bunch of busty stuff like this. He's probably afraid to object. Because then I'll put him at the top of the tree. (laughing) (Sally exclaims) What was he talking about? He was talking about you know, like what is your name or you know and I thought it was really strange 'cause how many people... I have to ask you a question. Don't get upset or anything. But do you have a job? I'm a criminal. [Sally] Come on. Yeah you know those people that want paid TV, cable TV, but they don't have to pay for it. I hook up paid cable TV, you know like the pirate TV cable guys. That's what I do. I got a question for you. Is there something wrong with him? [Sally] What do you mean? No. He never says very much. He just sorta sits there. Don't say that. You'll hurt his feelings. He understands everything you say. Look at him. He can't talk yet, but he understands everything. That's the thing, he's two but pretty soon he's gonna be talking all the time. That's all, you won't be able to shut him up. He says some words now but he's shy around you. What does he say? He says like, I don't know, like cow and Mama and bug. Sometimes he puts two words together. What? Kill bug. Things like that. But you know what, in a little while we're not gonna be able to shut him up, he's gonna be talking all the time. He's gonna go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's right. He'll start asking all the questions about everything. (tense music) [Man] Who the hell is that guy? [Man] I don't know, just a face, somebody connected with the Moletti group. We'll probably get a picture of him. [Man] I'll get him. [Man] Well try to get a make on him. (tense music) [Johnny] Why don't you go to bed? I'll be back in a couple of minutes. [Woman] I woke up and you were gone. [Johnny] I've got things on my mind. Hey Johnny, you don't have to worry about me being pregnant. What makes you think I was worried about that? You talked in your sleep again. I can never understand you, but there was just something about a baby. What'd I say? I told you, it was all mixed up. You were just talking about a baby you had to get rid of. But there's no baby to get rid of. So just relax. See, I've done that twice. It makes you feel really bad afterward.

I'm gonna get ya, Matthew, and do you know what I'm gonna do when I get you? I want everybody in that neighborhood questioned all over again. Somebody saw something. Send Lieutenant Burns over there. He oughta get along with those queers and lesbians in that area. It's handy to have a gay on the squad now and then. I don't mind if he would just stay in the closet. But he's an embarrassment. (knocking at door) The lady claims she and her baby were both taking a nap and the police sirens woke 'em up. They couldn't have seen anything. Ma'am, this is Detective Lieutenant Burns. I've got some pictures here I'd like you to take a look at. [Sally] What's the point of that? I didn't see anyone. Most of these are police mugg photos. The others were taken with hidden cameras by the Federal Narcotics Bureau. The suspects aren't even aware they've been photographed. I don't wanna look at your pictures, Lieutenant. [Lieutenant] Now, what's it gonna hurt to take a look at these photos? Like I told all the others, I'd like to help you but I can't. Any reason for me to stick around, Lieutenant? Nah, you can go. I'm all right. Thanks. Maybe somebody's been hanging around the neighborhood and you notice their face and a little bit of subliminal retention will count. But I didn't see anyone. Look Lieutenant, I have work to do. I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone so that I can, you know make my living. A bug. [Lieutenant] Could I have the address of Matthew's father? [Sally] No, what for? [Lieutenant] Could I have his name then, please? [Sally] What does that have to do with anything? I'd like to ask him a few questions. You know was he in town, does he come around? He really has nothing to do with my life... You let me be the judge of that. Listen, you are very uncooperative with everything that happened in that back alley. There's been a murder here. And if you've got a husband or an ex-husband lurking around, a man who could be violent. [Sally] Where did you get that idea? [Lieutenant] Didn't you file a complaint against Fred Severin? Didn't you have him picked up about 90 days ago? Didn't you charge him with assaulting you and attempting to kidnap your son? Or do I have the facts wrong? [Sally] You're asking me questions that you already know the answers to. I am sorry. That's the technique they train us to use. I don't enjoy being dishonest. Look, I don't want you to get the idea I'm trying to pressure you. But don't you think if you've got a husband that keeps coming back and bothering you that it would be more intelligent for you to just move out and not leave a forwarding address? You don't have a regular job, do you? What do you think I'm doing? I restore clothing and I sell to thrift stores. I don't wanna move and I don't wanna answer any more of your questions. Had he ever been here before? (Matthew exclaims) [Lieutenant] The man in the alley, the dead man. [Sally] No, he hadn't. He's a big time drug dealer. His specialty is delivering heroin and cocaine to the big brokers down on Wall Street. Oh my god. For crying out loud. Gimme the pictures. Now you've got dirt all over them. - Come on. - Be a good boy. - Oh. - Be a good boy. Please. (Matthew cries) It's all right. [Matthew] Mama! Mama! Now look, let me give you my card before I go. If you think of anything, you give me a call. Keep me in mind, okay? (laughing) I'll never forget you. [Lieutenant] Great. (pensive music) (phone rings) Hello? [Sally] Hello. How did you know where to find me? I called the university where you used to work part time and they gave me the number. What is it, Sally? Do you wanna serve me with some papers or something? No. I'm sorry, about what happened in the street the other day. I shouldn't have behaved that way in front of all those people, in front of Matthew. You just grabbed him and ran. Well I've tried asking in the past, it doesn't seem to do any good. He was just gone. He could've been kidnapped. How could I know? I freaked out. If I hadn't see you I would've called the police. I would've reported him as kidnapped. You coulda been shot down in the street like a dog, you could've been killed in front of Matthew. Things like that happen. I didn't mean to panic you, Sally. I thought you'd know it was me. I didn't even know you were in town. [Fred] Well that's because you don't open my letters. I'm willing to meet you. I wanna sit down and talk. Without your lawyer? I'll even come without my gun slinger all right? Sally, why don't you bring your boyfriend? [Sally] What boyfriend? Well you know, the one you've been sleeping with, the one who's been living in your apartment with Matthew and you. What, have you been spying on us? I think I have a right to know who's been living under my roof with my own child, Sally. Listen, if you don't wanna have that drink, after all you called me, Sally. You're trying to provoke me to hang up, but I'm not gonna hang up, 'cause I don't want a repetition of what happened with that afternoon. Do you understand? I wanna talk. Not scream? No, talk. If you think you can handle it, pick the place. All right, how about that restaurant near Sheridan Square? Tomorrow at seven? Seven o'clock. I'll see you then. Bye bye. (thoughtful music) So what do I get for $175 a day? What do you want? I might be able to pick up some stuff on your wife. Tie her in with drugs, alcohol, you name it. She gotta have some bad habits. This is the only bad habit I know about. You do this? I'm a commercial artist. You know you could make yourself a few extra bucks doing caricatures. You know those guys how charge you $15 and knock 'em off in 10 minutes? You get yourself a couple of beach chairs, sit yourself up near Sheridan Square, up near Central Park. Gone are the days where a man needs a store to operate in this town. Everybody's working the streets. I'm not looking for a way to pick up a few spare dollars. I'm looking for a name to go with this face. Why don't you ask your wife, I mean your ex-wife who this joker is? She might even tell you. I don't think she knows who he is. That's what worries me is she doesn't know him yet she trusts him. Maybe she just has him around for some sort of protection, maybe she's afraid you might come back. Is he a big guy, does he look like he can handle himself? Does he scare you? I thought maybe you could find out if he had a criminal record. I thought maybe you could find out with your contacts. There's nothing to it. It just gave me the creeps when I saw 'em together. It scared me. Particularly if she liked him and she did like him. And I bet she was all over him. How did that make you feel? Like in those movies, where the guy dies and he comes back and he goes through life and he sees his wife and his child and his family and he's invisible. And he watches them go through life without him. Well that's how it felt. Like a dead man that can't come back. So far they are concerned you are a dead man. Why don't you hold over, let go, mister, just let go. Find somebody else. You are a decent enough looking guy. Anybody can have a baby. Believe me, there's nothing to it. The trick is not having them. I didn't think it was a good idea to have Matthew. So I gave her money to have it stopped. And then I had to leave town to work on a new account. And then when I came back her clothes were gone, her belongings, everything, without a word. So you hired a detective. You must spend an awful lot of your money on private detectives. What about him? The All-American boy, right? Mister Clean? Well I don't think so. You can forget about digging up anything on my wife. Forgive me if I still call her my wife, but I like to. Get me something on that son of a bitch. (romantic music) A glass of red wine for me and a glass of white wine for the lady. Is that all right with you? Fine. Why don't you cash the checks I send you? Why don't you let me help? You don't have to. I want to. I need to. Why? Because I'm Matthew's father and I'm your husband. No, you're not. I don't have a home anymore. Strange apartments, strange furniture. I was furniture too. Was that the way I treated you? You moved me, arranged me, rearranged me. Fix your hair like this, like that, like in a magazine. And I did it 'cause I didn't know who I was. Well you were young then. Is that my fault? You remember? The house used to be full of magazines, Glamor Magazines. And I used to put this hair and makeup on to try to look like whatever girl you liked. (laughing) I mean how could you know me? I didn't know myself. Well if I'd thought you'd wanted a baby I never would've... That's not the point. I was like one of those characters in your illustration, a sketch, a few rough strokes that suggest a human being. What I'm trying to tell you is that it's not your fault. I don't blame you for not wanting to have a child with that pencil sketch of a person. You probably thought I couldn't take care of a child, that I would place it somewhere and forget where. I was a child myself. Not even that. You were a fine girl then, Sally. Well thank you, I'll accept that. But you know what, I'm a very good mother. And when Matthew gets to be four or five years old and he can talk and I can explain things to him, you're gonna see him. You're gonna see him and, well you know that's gonna happen before we even know it. But for now Fred, you gotta leave us alone. (thoughtful music) All right. I promise. I'll leave you alone. And don't send any more envelopes. I won't. I gotta go. Well at least here's to both of your health, but I figure if you need me or want me, you'll know where to find me. Fred, you should get married and have another child. You're ready for it. You're the second person that's told me that. (water splashing) Matthew, remember E.T.? Do ya? Sure you do. Look. There's E.T. Remember E.T. was in the garage. E.T. was in the garage and Elliott came out and he picked him up and he took him outta the garage and he took him into the house and he took him up to his room, didn't he? And he hid him there. You know why? 'Cause they were friends. It's good to have friends, Matthew. But you know when you have friends you gotta be able to trust 'em. Look, look, here's Elliott. He's in the room with him. And they're all alone and he didn't say anything, did he? He didn't tell a soul. Especially Mommy, he didn't tell Mommy because sometimes friends have secrets that they shouldn't tell Mommy. There are things that Mommy doesn't need to know, Mommy shouldn't know. Remember what happened when the other people found out the secret? Remember? He got all sick and turned white and he almost died, didn't he? You know why? You know why he almost died? 'Cause people found out the secret, that's why. (unsettling music) You know what? Sometimes grown ups and kids can have secrets too. But you gotta be able to trust 'em, don't you, Matthew? Don't ya? Look, there's E.T. He's lying in the closet and he's turned all white. And they're gonna put him in a coffin because he's dead. You know why he's dead? 'Cause the police found out. Matthew, the police must never find out. Never. God dammit Matthew, if you say anything, if you open your mouth and nail me, I don't have another planet to run to. I don't. So you keep that mouth of yours shut tight and don't say a word to anybody and we'll all live happily ever after, okay? (laughing) I'm going crazy. You don't even know who I am, do ya? I'm just a man just like any other man, aren't I? And they all look the same to you. I mean I don't have to worry about you. And you don't have to worry about me. Come on, so let's get outta here before you turn into a prune. Come on. (upbeat music) Guy across the street, somebody's watching you. The big guy. You make him? Gimme the bag and take off. (tense music) Taxi, taxi! Hurry up, he's getting away. (laughing) (tires screeching) Wait for me, keep the meter running. I'll be right back. Damn you, you couldn't wait. I've got your number. (suspenseful music) (crashing) (P.I. exclaims) (grunting) (knife thuds) [Johnny] I'm sorry. (unsettling music) (sighs) What do ya think? Come on kiddo, it's about time you saw where I lived, huh? What do ya think? Come on in. Come here, I'll show ya the view. Look. Over here. Whoa. Got a great view of the city. Look, see? What would your mama think if she saw where I lived? - One. - She'd like it? Just sit over here. You can jump on the furniture. Look, you can do anything you want to. How do you like that? You want a Coke? Want something to drink? Okay. Stay there. Johnny. Here you go, Matthew, how 'bout a Cokey. You want a Cokey? Here you go. Drink? There you go. (Johnny sighs) I wonder what your mother would think of all this, Matthew. What do you think? She'd probably shock the hell out of her, you know? I mean she'd have to wonder where the hell it all came from. You don't understand about getting things, though do ya? I mean you ask for a Coke, ya get it. You want a hot dog, ya got it. You want ice cream, you got it. You're gonna find out that you can't always just ask for something and get it. You're gonna find out that if you want something you're just gonna have to take it. I told you not to spill that, Matthew. Matthew, look at this. Watch. Who is that? Who is that? Who does that look like? Huh? Does it look like somebody you know? Yeah, it's me. No. It's not a very good likeness though, is it? No. You like it. I don't either. (doorbell buzzing) (tense music) (knocking at door) Who is it? [Man] It's Carlos. I've gotta talk to you. Right now. Come on, open up. Come on, open up. Johnny, open the door. Okay Matthew, remember hide and seek? I want you to stay here. We're gonna play hide and seek, okay? Pretend it's night time. And scary outside at night time, isn't it? So you stay here and you have some nice dreams, okay? Don't get up, stay there. (doorbell buzzes) (knocking at door) Hey, it's about time Johnny. You guys got business or what? You remember Manny. He came along to see how nice you were. Come. I checked the kid and he doesn't remember me. You gonna offer us a drink or what, Johnny? I don't like people coming into my place uninvited. Shall tell Mr. Moletti that? Man you live nice. (door rattling) You get a decorator's discount. Look, everything you see here came with the apartment. Now get out. [Carlos] Without us you wouldn't be living like this. Here's the situation. Either you tend to business or we tend to business and you're out. And we want you to know being out is dangerous to your health. You coulda told me this over the telephone. You didn't have to come dropping by like this. [Manny] Whack the kid out. An accident like Mr. Moletti says. I bet you have a nice view from the bedroom. You mind if I take a look? Yeah, I do mind. [Manny] You got a chippy in there? [Johnny] Yeah I do. Come on, Johnny, you know when it comes to kids, there are no guarantees. So Johnny, you're a stand up guy. You've proved you're human. You've proved you got feelings. But now you've got to prove that business comes first. Let me explain what Carlos is trying to say. A lotta people don't wanna see the little kid get hurt. They say Johnny's the problem, not the kid. And they'd feel less guilty about putting two in Johnny's coconut than whacking out some little kid. And the results are the same. We're insulated, we're moved. No one can connect us with what happened in that alley. So, no risk. Every day that kid lives puts your ass in the shithouse. Get out. Come on, everybody out. Let's go. Out. Mr. Moletti wants you to be at the old cemetery Friday night at ten-thirty so be there. (sighs) Well you got great timing, I'll say that for ya. Just you're no good at following orders. (suspenseful music) Sonny, come here. Come here little boy. Atta boy, come here. Hi sonny. Come on over here. Atta boy, atta boy. Do you remember me? Hey, look up here. Do you remember me? I saw you just a few days ago with your mom. Where's your mommy, is she home? Huh? Is she home now? Do you think she'd like another visit from me? I bet she would. I bet if I went around the block and knocked on your front door your mother would love to see me again. Don't you think so? - Go. - Why don't you go tell your mommy that I'm coming in right now. Okay? Is Matthew all right? Yeah he's fine. Where you going? I gotta go somewhere. I'll call you later. Okay. Matthew? Oh look. (knocking at door) What, did you forget something honey? (tires screeching) I really don't enjoy being harassed. If I were a man you wouldn't bother me like this. But since I'm a woman and I have a child... If you were a man I woulda had you picked up for obstruction of justice. I woulda thrown you into the lockup for 72 hours for questioning. Now if I'd done that to you, your husband mighta come over and picked up the kid and he'd be outta the state by now. Now look lady, this particular killing happens to be very important to us. The feds have been after these guys for a long time. It would be a big feather in our cap if we could supply some material evidence that would put these people away. Do you understand that? It would be good for my career. Not to be selfish, mind you, but I suppose my career is more important to me than whether you spend 72 hours in the lockup or you lose your kid or not. Aw, look at him, he's setting the table. Isn't that cute? Most kids cry when they're hungry; he sets the table. He even knows how to fold his napkin. Knife. Oh no, you shouldn't play with knives, Matthew. Gimme the knife, come on sonny, gimme the knife. It's dangerous to have him running around playing with weapons like that. Okay, I'll look at your pictures. Oh god, look at that guy. You have to deal with these men all the time, right? These kind of. Oh that's a woman. That's a woman. And she's a big woman and she is mean. I don't want you looking at these for somebody that ya like. I want you to look at these for somebody that you know. (gasps) Oh my god, I was wrong. I think I've seen this guy around the block. You should ask the other people in the neighborhood. - This is great. - Maybe they've seen him - as well. - This is terrific. We've been trying to get something on this son of a bitch for a long time. Thank you. No, this is terrific. Thank you very much. See, it doesn't hurt to cooperate. That's what you wanted. Schmuck. (laughs) Oh god, this guy's ugly. Hmm. Oh, his pictures. He'll be back for them. Oh. (growls) I thought you said you weren't coming back here again. I wanted you to meet Carl. (tense music) You had it all going for ya. And you pissed it away on some kid. So you brought in somebody new, huh? Who the hell are you, my replacement? Getting old, getting old and sloppy. Let's go for a walk. (punches thudding) (growling and grunting) Keep your promise to Mr. Moletti. Tomorrow. (kick thuds) (Johnny grunts) [Waitress] Want some coffee? Thank you. You didn't have to spend all that money. You coulda come over. I have food. Yeah I know, you've been looking real tired from being cooped up so much. I think we oughta try to get away. The way you said that makes it sound permanent. Well, why the hell not? Matthew's not in school. You ever been to San Diego or Los Angeles? How do you expect to earn a living out there? I don't know, I'll find something. That cop, what'd he want? He has these photographs he wanted me to look at. Again. But I got rid of him. How? I picked one, some guy out in Jersey. Don't you realize that when they bring him down they're gonna ask you to come down and identify him? Then I'll say I made a mistake. Anyway, we'll be gone if you have your way. No, they'd come looking for me. A material witness. Material witness on the run. And they'd come and get us and bring us back. So I guess we can't go away. Not until they catch this murderer. Oh look at you. You have cake all over your face. I guess I'd better go get a wet cloth or something. (playtul music) Matthew, we gotta figure a way to get your mother out of town. Come on, you're a smart kid. Matthew, how am I gonna get that cop off my back. (Matthew growls) (unsettling music) Oh look at you. Boy you have chocolate all over your face. Wow. You're a disgrace, that's what you are. (laughing) He's got it all over him. Well I don't know where that girl is with the check. I really have to run. I have so many deliveries to make. Anyway, I'd better go. No! Let me take him to the park. (birds fluttering) (pensive music) Come on, you like the swings, Matthew? Come on, let's go get a swing. (grunts) You like to fly, Matthew? I used to fly. I used to fly up in the sky. You wanna swing high? Let's pick a swing. Oh you don't need that one. That's got a bar on it. You're a big boy. You can take this one without the bar, can't ya? There ya go. Okay, let's put your hood up there. Come on. (thoughtful music) Well it looks like we got the whole place to ourselves, huh Matthew? I used to fly way up in the clouds, Matthew. You like that, don't ya, huh? Yeah, we're gonna go real high, Matthew, come on. You're gonna fly out into the clouds. Come on, Matthew. (birds fluttering) Come on Matthew, fly Matthew. (tense music) (birds fluttering) (Matthew screams) What were you trying to do to him? You knocked the kid onto the ground. You did that to your own kid. What are you trying to lay on me anyhow? You told Sally you weren't gonna bother her. It's not Sally or the boy I'm interested in right now. It's you. Me? What am I to you? I don't want ya hanging around Matthew anymore. Do I scare you? Yeah, I guess maybe you do. Matthew, come here. [Johnny] Matthew, stay where you are. - Matthew, come to Daddy. - Matthew, stay where you are. You know I love you. Come over by your daddy. Come here Matthew. Stay outta the way. Oh shit. Listen, I don't want any part of you. I'm sorry. (punches thudding) (tense music) You stay here, you stay right here. Don't move. Johnny. Stop it, Johnny. Lay off. No! You want him to bother ya? He'll never stop. He's never gonna leave you alone. You're killing him. He's hurt. - (punch thuds) - He doesn't feel anything. I could put him on it right now and he wouldn't feel a thing. Don't you know that's the only way you're ever gonna get rid of him? That's not you. That's not you, Johnny. I busted up my hand on this sucker. He's got a hard head. I'm standing here with a busted up hand and you're gonna feel sorry for him. That's what you get for playing the big protector. (slap cracks) What are you looking at? What are you looking at? All right look, I know I didn't score any points, I blew it. But the guy's an asshole. He always would be one. I mean talk's too easy for him. He doesn't understand talk. This he understands. I think you broke his jaw. A broken jaw he won't forget. You didn't give him a chance. Where'd you learn to fight like that? I pick things up. I gotta call a cop, he's gotta go to the hospital. What are you gonna say? That a stranger beat him up, okay? All right, all right. Gimme the key. Gimme the key. Why? [Sally] So you won't be coming 'round no more. Here take that. Daddies get beat up. They don't always win every fight. But he's still your daddy and he cares about you. So you watch over him now. Watch over him. Because he cares about you. Who's that? Jesus, what happened to him? Oh I don't know, I just found him like that. Do you know him? No, I've just seen him around. Hey don't you think you oughta call a hospital or something? Listen I'll take care of that. Why don't you get the little boy home where he belongs. He shouldn't see something like this. It might affect him. Thank you. What do you mean you're gonna take him to a child psychiatrist? What does he need that for? Cancel the appointment. I lost my temper. Haven't you ever lost your temper? The guy said some things to me that I wouldn't wanna repeat to you. He talked to me like garbage. I lost it. It was more than that. Remember, I was there. I tried to stop you. I think you woulda smashed me if I'd gotten in your way. If you were strong enough you woulda done the same thing a long time ago. I hope I wouldn't have. Look, you gotta give me time. Johnny, I'm not ready. I've been spending too much time with you anyway. Matthew's entitled to a little attention, to have his mommy all to himself. Anyway you've gotta give me a chance to forget. Forget what? To forget that look on your face. (unsettling music) (banging) Look Matthew, there's your horsey. Matthew, you're my favorite customer. How many times you been here? 203? Now hold on honey. Get on. Hey, there you go. [Sally] Sweetheart, hold on tight. Hold on. [Operator] One of these days I'm gonna give you a free ride. Is that nice? Huh? That's nice? (whimsical music) I'll be right back, okay? Sure lady, sure. (tense music) - Stop! - Hey! Stop. Stop, stop! Matthew! [Operator] Hey, hey! Stop, stop! Matthew. (thumping) Matthew! (screeching) (dinging) Come on, Matthew. Don't look at me like that. I'm still your buddy. How many kids get their very own merry-go-round to ride on, huh? You oughta be happy. You oughta say, thanks Johnny, you got me my very own merry-go-round to ride around on. But come on out, 'cause you need some rest before you go on any more rides, Matthew. Come on, come here. Gimme your hand. Come on. We're gonna play a little game. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 20, 21, 22, 30. 40, 41, 50. 70, 71, 72, 73, 80. 90. Okay Matthew, I'm gonna give ya a sporting chance. 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Anyone around my truck is it! (suspenseful music) You know I'm gonna find you, Matthew. Matthew, you know you shouldn't be running around here. There's broken glass and jagged shit all over the place. You're gonna cut and hurt yourself. You fall down. Matthew, how come you weren't so good at hide and seek at my apartment, huh? You don't want your mommy to get pissed off at me do you, Matthew? I don't want you to fall down and cut yourself. You're gonna say I was irresponsible. I don't wanna take ya home all cut up and bloody, Matthew! (startling music) Gotcha. (suspenseful music) (water lapping softly) I'm sorry Matthew. (sad music) (door slams) [Woman] It'll be all right. They'll find Matthew. Look, you've had a bad fall. You've hurt yourself. (Sally laughs) Come on, that isn't gonna help anything. (Sally sighs) Right. (laughs) Are you sure you're gonna be all right? Your hand. It doesn't hurt. I don't feel anything. You should've gone to the hospital to see after that hand like the cop suggested. [Woman] We'd be glad to stay with you for a while. Look, I really appreciate all your help. But, there's nothing for you to do. I just have to wait here until the phone rings. You didn't see who was driving? Some sickie, probably that bastard ex-husband of yours. Sure, he no sooner gets outta the hospital... Oh he is such a jerk. Look, I really don't think that we should waste our energy - on such a jerk... - Hey! [Woman] Come on, she needs to be alone. (sad music) (tense music) (phone rings) Hello? Yes? Detective Lieutenant Burns thinks he may have left some police photos at your apartment. [Sally] Yes. Can we send an officer over to pick up those photos? [Sally] No. (thoughtful music) Oh. (tense music) (eerie music) (pounding at door) [Johnny] Pizza. Open up. (tense music) Dammit, I said open up. Hold it right there, you bastard. Now just tell me where the kid is. I'm trying to get to Sally's, get out of my way. Will you tell me where Matthew is? I don't know where Matthew is. That's the whole point. I'm trying to find out myself. You know you're crazy? You're all crazy. [Johnny] Why you got the chain on the door for? Open this up. Just a minute. Something terrible has happened. Someone has taken Matthew. Tell me where that kid is. Dammit. God dammit. I've gotta get to Sally, she needs me. She doesn't need you. She never needed you. (suspenseful music) [Johnny] I'm sorry Sally. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! (yelling) [Matthew] Mama! (Matthew sobs) Mama! (unsettling music) (upbeat music)
