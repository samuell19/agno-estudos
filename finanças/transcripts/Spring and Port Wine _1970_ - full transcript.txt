It's me, Mother! Oh Florence, you're just in time. Could you, um... Run me eye over the housekeeping? Seem to have got a bit messed up with my figures. - What, again? - Well, the money's right. It's just the writing that's wrong. Right. Go on, go on! Get off! Go on, go on, go on. - But you can't take our telly away. - Get off! Not on a Friday. Oh, shut up or I'll... Get her off! Just carrying out orders, missus. Get off. It's either this or money, missus, you're nine weeks in arrears! Hold on a minute! I might be able to borrow it. You have a deficit of one pound seven shillings. - You mean I'm that out? - Yes, when you've paid these bills. Could you lend me a pound, love, to make it right? Put your Dad's mind at rest. I don't know. Money has a funny way of slipping through my fingers. Money has a funny way of slipping through anybody's fingers if they keep them open. You're still seven shillings out! I suppose I paid the window cleaner, which I haven't, since he hasn't been. - Heaven help you if Dad ever finds out. - Heaven help him. Such faith in the poor chap. Daisy! Oh, that's Betsy-Jane. - Now look, don't let her hold you up. - Daisy! Remember it's Friday. Daisy, can you help me? I'm in trouble, dead trouble. I've got to have six pounds, can you lend it me? Six? Whatever for? The television chaps are taking the set back. Oh, no. Unless I pay up, I got behind with the payments. I swear my oath, I'll let you have it back the minute he hands over his wages. You couldn't have come at a worse time. He'll murder me if he gets home tonight and there's no telly. Well, I could let you have three quid at a pinch. They won't budge under six. Well, can't you get three quid from someone else? Neighbors aren't what they used to be in the old days. Had it cleaned last week. Oh, come on Daisy, you can scrape me up the rest. I know you Cromptons always have money in the house. Aye, but it's under lock and key. - You mean, you won't let me have it? - I can't! Rafe's got this obsession about having things right, paying on the dot. Well, why should a man pry into the housekeeping? It's a woman's job, housekeeping money, always has been. Long as the bills are paid, I'm happy running home. You don't run the home, money runs the home! And that jumped up husband of yours, he handles it all! How dare you talk like that in my kitchen? I dare because it's true. If only you could hear what the neighbors say about you. What they would do to a man who tried to run their side of the house. - Get out. Get out of my house. - Your house! I'll tell you something, hey! I'll tell you something, bad as I am, I wouldn't swap places with you! That chap of yours has sucked all the pride out of you! - Hello! - Aye aye. - You going to the match Saturday? - Yes, I'm going. - I'll see you there then. - You might do, they'll lose. - Aye, aye! - Go to hell. Hey up. Hey, what's up? - There's nothing wrong, is there, Mum? - Would you say I had no pride? You, Mum? You've pride in everything you touch! - Have you got your wages? - Sure, why? - Could you let me have six pounds? - Six? I'll give them back to you later. I hope you fall and break your bloody necks. Thank you, thank you madam. You touch that thing, and I'll have cruelty to animals society on you! - Getting panicked, are you? - You won't even have the chance. - What the hell do you want? - Me mum sent you this money. - She's not, has she? - Aye, why, what's up? She's a right good neighbor. Hey, hold on a minute, you sods! Hey, hang on, wait! Get off, Shaggy! Pack it up, will you? Hello, love! Put that back where you found it, and see that it's in working order. Come on, Joe. Where's mum? She's run off with the milkman. Funny. - Get off! - Here I am, love. Hello! - I've had a lovely party at work. - Yeah, you look it. One of the mechanics got married, so all the weavers pulled together for a cheese and wine party. Springtime orgies in the weaving shed? We only had cider in my time. Aye, things were tight during the Boer War. Cheeky. Afraid there's no letter for you, love. They've forgotten you. I don't care. Mum, shall I start frying the herrings? No love, you can help me lay out the table. - Oh, we're not having herrings? - Why, what's wrong with them? - I've gone off them. - Funny. - Hello Mum, what's funny? - Nothing. Your Dad asked for them special. - Him, well, I won't eat any. - We'll see. - I'm telling you, I won't. - Oh, you will. You'll dance to your daddy, my bonnie lassie. You'll dance to your daddy, my bonnie lass! You'll get a fishy on a little dishy, you'll get a fishy when your dad comes home! Dad! Dad, dad, dad. It's all dad in this house, you'd think the sun shone out of his backside. Out the way, love. Turn it! Hurry up! Hurry up! Kick it! Kick it! Don't blame you two. There's mud on this... Never had a ball like that in our day. We were glad of an old tin can. Aye, don't know they're born. If Dad comes home and catches you in his chair... Listen, he's got any complaints, tell him to come to me, - I'll tell him where he gets off, right. - Get your greedy feet, please. Hello. Aye, he's coming down that road. Who do you think you're kidding? - He's not, is he? - Yeah. Well, why the hell didn't somebody tell me? Well, help me somebody. Mum, Mum! Turn the telly on somebody, to get his mind off things! Come on, move! He'll be in in a minute! Listen to that silence. It's rarer than gold, these days. - Hello, Dad. - Mother. - Had a hard day? - Not hard, but wearing. Expect it tolls on you by weekend. OG and Seller, night of sex and drugs. Why soil your mind with that stuff, child? After all, it is the truth, Dad. Nay son, it may be fact, but it's never truth. You see that Holy Bible, lad, there might not be one single undisputed fact in it. But who dares say that every word isn't God's truth. - Your slippers, Dad. - Thank you, Florence. Truth is a spiritual thing, it survives the centuries but filth is for the moment. Helps them sell their magazines. When I do count the clock that tells the time, and see the brave sun sunk in hideous night. When I behold the violets past prime, and sable curls all silver'd o'er with white. When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, which... Erst from heat did canopy the herd. - Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. Folk would think you were daft if you walked about with a book of poetry under your arm. If most folk were to know what other folk think about them, they'd drop dead from shock. Some would, that's for sure. Hey. Dad, would you like to take our money now? I might as well. In this day and age, thank God my mates can't see me. There you are, Dad. Thank you, Florence. Hilda's money, Dad. Thanks. - And here's my wich bagging money, Dad. - Thank you, Wilfred. I say, Dad. I say, I'll just feel cold about doing the Messiah next Monday. Yes, I'm hoping to be there. You're a pound short. Eh, you what? No, I... There it is, fancy that. - I'm not one of them, lad. - One of what? One of them you take me for. Tea's nearly ready. Have you seen... How'd you manage with the housekeeping money this week, Mother? All right. What's leftover is in the book. Well it's a good servant, but the poor master was always right. Always look after the pence. And he'll look after the pounds. - Can we start, Mother? - When I'm ready. I see the window cleaner was around again. Mustn't let the tea get cold. Fair enough, Mother. Giving out a shilling or two to the good. You know, at times, you astonish me. At times, I astonish myself. Housekeeping money. Let me know if you are any short. Thanks, I will. Well? I won't be a moment. Oh, come on Hilda. Hey, now move that chair. Oh, this flaming tripe. At it again, Dad? I can only give you 30 shillings this week, Mum. - Put some money down on a new wig. - I don't blame you. The damn telly's on the blink again. Has somebody moved it? I've my weekend cleaning to do, haven't time. Oh, blast it. Now it's your week this week. I slave all week and they're short with me on me housekeeping. You'll manage, you always do. "You'll manage." Bloody men, all over. I don't expect to manage on that. Did not give that dog any biscuits. For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. - Pass the eggs, Mum. - Thank you, love. - Wilf, pass the tartar sauce. - Eh? Sauce tartar. Tartar, do you fancy a bit, Dad? No thank you, I prefer the natural taste of the herrings. I really don't fancy my herring, if you don't mind. 'Course not love, bite a nice fried egg instead. Poached please, on toast. I'll wait 'till you finish, Mum. Won't take a minute, love. Just a minute, Mother. Is there anything wrong with your herring? No, I just don't feel like it. That's a bonny fresh herring cooked in best butter. How any child of mine can have the nerve to say she doesn't fancy it? I don't know. What else can I say, if I don't? You can eat it, and say nothing. - I'll go and poach that egg. - No, you don't. Why not? This is a home, not a cafeteria. Yes, and I bring my share into the home. So I think am entitled to say what I'd like to eat. 'Course you are, love. You don't think I've thought any less of you over the years when you brought not a penny in? I'd have sought to see the smiling face you had in those days. Then you were bringing 20 pounds a week in today. Won't take me a minute to poach an egg. No eggs coming on the scene, poached or fried. Right, then I'll go. - Excuse me, everybody. - Sit down will you! Only pigs leave their troughs as it suits. See, my wife keeps requesting me to retire. She got her eye on this little bungalow in Livingston Gardens. It's a damn good job, Arthur. House goes with it. Bits of furniture as well. But I must have a married man. - Well, I'm not even engaged. - Keeping company with a likely lass. One of Rafe Crompton's daughters. She'll see the light. - Well, I'll tell her tomorrow. - You'll tell her tonight. But Mr. Aspinall, I'm just finishing this job! Leave it, love's more important than overtime. Here. Hey, come back and finish it. And I'll tell you this. Your mother would have given thanks to God for that good wholesome food on your plate when she was your age. How come, Dad? Hunger. Have you heard of it? I was out of work at time, whole country was out of work, three million of them. Hardly a week went by that they didn't fish out some poor fella's body out of canal. Eh, Mother? Aye, many poor women, too. Aye, that must've been a long time ago. I remember one hot summer day particularly, we set out on a picnic, with some sandwiches we'd made with the last of our bread and a bottle of cold tea, and, suddenly, up at the top of the road, we came upon the hunger marches. There's a great long line of unemployed men who'd set out from Clydeside to go to the Houses of Parliament. I remember now, I remember their faces. Were they singing? No, they weren't singing. They didn't have the strength to sing. They were whistling, Loch Lomond. Well, we stood there watched them go by. And then this poor little chap came hobbling up and I felt your mother pull the sandwiches from under my arm. And she gave them to him. Aye, but those times are all dead and gone. Never to return. They may be dead and gone to you, but they're not dead and gone to me. Calm yourself, Dad. How can I keep calm? When you spend years of your life trying to make a decent home for your children. - Just as you ought. - As you ought to! But do your children thank you? Happen the odd one does, but they mostly just take it for granted. Well, nobody's going to take me for granted. And I won't have them making little of good food at my table because it makes little of the lives that we and millions of people like us have had to live. I'm sorry about all that. But nothing you say will make me eat that herring. We'll see. Mother, guard that herring, serve it up at every meal. If you get the best of me, lass, you'll be the first in this house that has. The man's obsessed. They'll be coming to take him away, Haha! They're coming to take him away. How do? How do? - All right? - Aye. Cromptons live here. Oh, that's right. Hey Florence, guess who? It's your beloved! - I'll get it! - I can do it. Come on! Give it to 'em, then. I wonder what he wants to come around here for on a Friday? I sometimes wonder what he wants coming around here for at all. Hilda. Well, come in. - I think he's bought you a present. - That'll make a change. Go on in. - Wilf, Harold. - Arthur. Oh, it's for your father. - Sit down, Arthur. - Thank you. - It's not from me. - Oh, I see. A fella gave it to me. - Listen. - What's up? Rafe Crompton Esquire, bespoke overcoat, super Crombie, 40 guineas received with thanks. 40 Guineas? They must've seen him coming. Hey, Wilf, Dad's here. It wasn't a present for you, Florence. It's for Dad. - Oh! - Good evening, Arthur. From Oswald and Trop, Dad. Could be a top coat I ordered sometime back. Florence, hang it up in the wardrobe, will you? Aren't you gonna try it on first, Dad? Aye, come on Dad! Nay, I've had three fittings. Well, I always say you can't trust them cheap tailors. Steady on, lad! Knots were made to be unfastened. What's brought you around, then? Something private, like. Hello, Arthur. - Good evening, Mrs. Crompton. - Nice surprise. - Cup of tea, Arthur? - Oh no, no, no. I've just had my tea, thank you. How about a nice fried herring? You think we could have a few words? Speak up, Arthur, we hide nothing in this house. That's what you think. Well, it's about my boss, Mr. Aspinall. Don't tell me he is retiring at last. Aye, he is. You never know when you need a piece of string. You might wanna hang yourself. Oh Dad, what a beauty. - Oh, come on Dad, just try it on. - Ah, come on Dad. - What about him? - Hmm? Aspinall. Oh aye, well, he's retiring and he says he'd like to make me working manager if I... Oh, Dad! What a lovely coat. It fits you to perfection, Dad, doesn't it, Mother? Yes, it looks very nice. Suit lining and stitched, and taped seams. Aye, one sneeze and he's naked. - If what? - If? Aye, um... If I were married. Why a married man? It's to get him a better hold on you. No, it's not that so much. No, I suppose it's... Well, a married man is not in such a hurry to get home every night. He's proposing. You want to jump in with both feet at your age. If Arthur needs your matrimonial advice, he'll come and ask for it. - I'll take your coat upstairs, Dad. - Take it right away. Shan't need it 'til winter. - I've put a cover over it, Dad. - Thank you, love. - Well? - Well. Well, it's not an offer to be sneezed at. Nobody is sneezing. Now I thank you not to dip your nib where there's no ink. I'll be off. If you're the lass I think you are, Florence, you'll tell Mr. Alf Aspinall that when a Crompton gets married, they choose the time and the man. Not him. No offense, Arthur. - Ta-ra. - Good night, and good shuttance. - Give the girl a chance, Dad. - You mean Hilda? I mean our Florence. She won't get a better man than Arthur. Maybe I was a bit hard on her. You know that's riled her, that herring. You know what it is with her, young blood. But it needs cooling. Could you always cool yours? On top of it, Arthur, we have to hand our money over to him ever Friday. You don't expect to be kept for nothing, do you? It's as Dad said, it's not a lodging house, it's a home, and a good one too. I suppose a bad home is better than none, really. If you're not satisfied, you just go and try and find dibs as good as your own home. I would, too. Only I don't fancy listening to my own jokes. I can't say I blame you. Hey Hilda, guess what? Arthur's proposed to Florence and she's turned him down. - Don't you jump to conclusions! - Oh! You wouldn't have to ask me twice, Arthur. - Me, neither. - Oh, Wilfred, darling! I mean, if I were a woman! The bride Wilfred Crompton was given away by his plastic surgeon Dr. Knacker-Off. Oh shut up, will you? - Hello, Mr. Crompton. - Hello, Betty. Has your Hilda had her tea yet? I fancy she'll be having something presently. Now that I'm out the way. I think it would have become him more to have paid less for his coat and to have bought you a new one. Listen, love, your father would lay down his life for me. It's not the same thing. No, I don't suppose it is. I used to be so proud of him, being our dad. Wonder what's made him change? I wonder, is it only him that's changed? Well, is it? Betty's called for you. Oh, ta. I think your father is quite handsome. Handsome? He's positively frightening. Yeah, that's what makes him so fascinating. Where would you find a frightening father these days? He makes two of you. - Here, here! - Hey! - Come on. - Hey, there's a rave up at Olly's tonight, starts about 10. You coming? What about it, Arthur, you fancy your chances? I wouldn't mind, for a change. You'll stay where you are. He comes around to propose, then he wants to slope off in search of crumpet. Listen, I don't think I'll bother. I don't know what's come over you, lately? Ever since her Donald threw her over, the pilot officer or whatever he was. I threw him over, if you want to know! For his bride, a pilot sought her For his bride, a pilot sought her But a pilot false was he But a pilot false was he On the banks of island water On the banks of island water - Not so far - Stop it! Stop it! Leave me alone, will you? Now what's the matter with you, child? Hilda dear, don't upset yourself like that. Oh, Arthur. I wish you'd come around to ask me to marry you, I'd be packed and out of this house by now. Well, he hasn't, so have your tea instead. I think I'd better be off. You came to ask our Florence something, so don't go without your answer. I think I've had it. Oh, Mum. No, I can't, I... If I know anything about your sister Florence, she'll be living here looking after our dad when he's bloody 90. And if I know anything, you'll be here keeping him company. Go on. Have you noticed anything different about your Hilda lately? No. But I noticed how you took her into your arms. What, you mean when she was crying? - You didn't mind that, did you? - I didn't mind. But the thought crossed my mind that you've never once taken me into your arms like that. - I've never once seen you cry. - I don't go in for tears. - You seem very fond of our Hilda. - Do I? More fond than you are of me, perhaps? Aye. Aye, perhaps I could be. Now perhaps you've been coming to see the wrong one. Well, maybe I have, you never know. Well, thanks for being honest. - Please drop me off at the next bus stop. - There's one little difference. Careful, it's only the traffic light. What's the little difference? I'm fond of your Hilda, but I love you. And I always shall. And now I'm gonna drop you off at the bus stop, and we'll never meet again. I'll never forget you. Hey, put him down, you dirty little sex pot! Can't you wait till you get home? Hey! - What do you want? - What do you think? Me mum's six pounds. Oh, well that's something I'll have to arrange with your mother. Oh yes, well, she said you can arrange it with me now. Come in then, love. I'll arrange it. Lovely, bloody lovely. I'll bet five-to-one against Crompton. - Take it, Ned. - Hey, come on, give over. I didn't mean that, you know I'm not a betting fella. Too late, he's taking it. You've done it, lad! - Pay it. - I knew I shouldn't have come out today. Not my sort of day, this. One, two, three... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. There you are. Look, I don't care how other families live. I'm not gonna let my kids run me. Once your kids lick you, you're licked for good. It's your own mission. Why even a six month old child knows when it's boss. It shouldn't be a battle, Dad, bringing up a family. I know, but it is these days. You'd be surprised the times I wonder, is it all worthwhile? Our Hilda certainly isn't one for giving in. I know what you're going to say. She's as stubborn as her father. And they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. But I won't give in. Well, would you like to see upstairs? Upstairs? We could come some other time if you prefer? Well, we might as well do it now. Face the worst. Well, its a sorta sitting room on the first floor, really. I like this room, Arthur. Well, we might have to throw them out. You know, I mean, if you decided. I wouldn't throw this out, if we got married. It's very nice. - I like that table. - Oh, aye. Who brought the flowers? Who do you think? Hello, love. Hello, Mum. - Some beef sandwiches. - No thanks, Mum. Why not, love? Aren't you hungry? Help you get over tea time. I've resolved to eat that flaming herring. It's the strain. - Haven't you felt it? - Felt it? Oh child, there's been times when I felt so pulled out of myself among the lot of you, I wished I could live among strangers for a week or two just to get my bearings again. I'll eat every damn morsel, skin, tail, fin, the lot! Even if it makes me sick. I'll put him through it. Florence? - Look at my face. - What about it? - They'll be able to tell. - They won't. - I'll not be able to face my father. - I could face a den of lions. Mother. Wood anemones. I knew you'd like them. Oh, they're lovely. Thank you. Where'd you find them? Up in the gully. Is our Hilda in? - In her room, why? - I think the lesson has gone home. I can't say I've enjoyed a meal since it started. You mean you don't want me to serve the herring at teatime? Just serve it. She mustn't get the idea that she's bested me. All I want is for her to make the least move and I'll whip it out of the way. To be honest, I'm fed up with the sight of the damn thing myself. No more than I am. - Hello, enjoyed yourselves? - Yes, thanks. - Everything as you expected? - Aye, I think so. Eh, Florence? Yes. Yes, Mum. Yes, well I'll... I'll go and get the tea. I've been out on the moors. Why people want to go abroad, I don't know. The air is like wine, it inspires you. Mother, come and give us a song. Haven't heard from you for some time. Oh, Dad, I'm rusty. Get ready, Mother. Slumber Dear maid Green boughs will cover thee Cometh breathe over thee Where thou art laid Slumber, dear maid Green boughs will cover thee Cometh breathe over thee Where thou art laid Slumber, there peacefully Oh, gentle maid Green boughs will cover thee Cometh breathe over thee Where thou art laid Green boughs will cover thee Cometh breathe over thee Where thou art laid Where thou art laid By gum, Dad, but you are in good voice. Always do a thing when the impulse moves you, lad. Yes Dad, I agree. Give me a hand with the tea, Hilda. Looks like you're all famished. King of kings, Hallelujah, Hallelujah Do you know it's funny, but you never hear families singing together these days. Do you remember those lovely concerts at the old St. Sophie's Hall, Dad? Oh. Its a gambling club now, Dad. It's sad the moral decay that a bit of prosperity brings with it. - Here we are. - Thanks, Mum. Hey. Our Hilda's herring. - What about it? - It's gone. It's gone? It's gone where? Well, how should I know? I'll bet the cat's had it. No cat of mine ever took things that weren't given. He always has been a funny cat. It'd have to be a very funny cat to get herring from between two plates and put plates back in position. Happen Mum forgot to put top plate on? - Did you, Mum? - Happen I did, love. And it went back on itself. Aw, come on, let's start. Mum, get pouring the tea... Now wait a minute. I'll go and take a look. Don't touch anything. That cat had better have nine lives. You two were singing. Have you something to tell me, lad? Something to tell you, Dad? Did you give that herring to the cat? Who, me? I wouldn't do a thing like that. Would I, Mum? 'Course you wouldn't, love. Knowing what store Dad had set on it. I mean, I'd only just got home when I joined in singing. You must have heard me singing. - Yes, I did. - Thanks, Harold. Now, come on, let's get on with our teas. Now, just a minute. You haven't answered my question yet. Now stand up. Now then, did you give that herring to the cat? Me, Dad? Why should I? I didn't have to eat it, did I? - I like herrings, don't I, Mum? - 'Course you do, love. Oh, come on, Mother, let's start. We don't want an inquest on a herring. Now for the last time, did you give that herring to the cat? Who me? No, positively not, as they say. I could swear to it, I could, honest. Oh, you could swear to it? No, Mum, he can't do that. No Dad, not the Bible. Now, take this holy book in your hands. - Mum, don't let him make me. - Look, Mum, this isn't right. - Quiet! - Dad. Let him tell you in his own way. He's told me in his own way. I must have the truth. I can't. Why can't you? It would be wrong, Dad, to swear on the bible over a herring. - Wouldn't it, Mum? - Dad, please. Its not the herring I'm concerned about, it's the truth. It's the only way to live, by the truth. Don't press him too far, Dad. I only want to know the truth. I won't give in on that. Here, take it. Now, hold it up. Mother, stop him! Say, "I swear, by Almighty God." No. I must tell you. I... All right, if you want to know, I took your bloody herring. I did it. Now lookout, he's falling! Don't let him fall. You pressed him too far, Dad. Arthur, open the window. Mind out of the way, Mother, whilst I put him on the couch. Wilfred. You! Look what you've done to him, you and your rotten truth! I could... Hilda! Look at me. Mum! Shh. I'm going, Mum, I can't stand it anymore. Take care of our Wilf. Later. Now all sit down, please. With a pot of tea. Did I hurt one of my toes? Just a little one, love. Lie there a minute or two. - Sit down, Arthur. - No, thank you. I'm never gonna sit at your table again. - Arthur! - Nay, don't stop him. I used to respect you, but now I see you're nothing but a bully. - I'm learning. - You'll never learn. You'll never learn. Not while you ram your way down everybody else's throat. You make out you help people, but you only belittle them. - Are you done? - No, I haven't. You used that Holy Bible for your own ends, and yet you set yourself up as God fearing. My folk are nowt, but they'd never dare do a thing like that. I'm sorry, Mother, you know, it just had to come out. Florence, are you ready? - Ready? - To come with me. You know what it'll mean if you go? God bless, love. Well, fancy that. Come on, to me. Get it. Go on, get it! Go! Don't worry, love, it might never happen. Hello, Mr. Duckworth. What's up, love? You must be frozen to the marrow. I'm all right, thanks. - Just leave me alone, please. - Has somebody said something to you? You don't wanna get yourself upset by that. Come on home, love. Our Betty's in. Come on. Go on. Give it! Give it to me. What will your mother think? She can think what the hell she likes. Hey Arthur, you brought Florence around. Aye, Mother. To stay. She can have my bedroom, I'll make do with parlor. - To stay? - Aye, we plan to marry this week. Hmm. What's got on to our Arthur all of a sudden, then? Oh well, come on in. I'll go and make a cup of tea, Mother. Come on, Bet. Hilda, love. Some tea there for you. How did you sleep? Where have you put the flaming salts then? Morning Hilda, love. Hello, Mr. Duckworth. Where are they, then? - In the bathroom. - Thank you. Bet, Betty! Oh, let me in first, Dad! - Oh. Oh, go on, let me in first. - Hang on. Oh come on, come on. The tea is getting cold, love. He's got the hump on him because he didn't get his way with me last night. Bloody men. I'll show him he can't buy me with a bottle of Guinness. What crabbed him was, I sopped it and he got nothing for all his trouble. Oh, you're still in? Tell her I want some more tea. He says he wants some more tea. He thinks he's in the saloon bar. Ask her where's the bloody egg? He wants to know where's bloody egg? Tell him he's bloody egg. There is only one, and I'm giving that to little Hilda. Why didn't you say so? I'll begrudge that girl nothing. Come on, get it down you. Oh Bet, I really can't face a fried egg this morning, I'm sorry. Pity, it was our last. Mum and Dad nearly had a fight over it. Oh Bet, come on, that smoking makes me feel sick. I'm off. Seen Fred lately? Fred? Fred who? Your little friend. You won't eat herrings, you can't stand eggs, smoke makes you sick. Muggins, look up your calendar, check your dates. Hilda? I'm sorry, Mum. I can see you good, love a cry. How was it at Betsy-Jane's? They're a mucky lot, Mum. Good hearted. - I couldn't stay there. - Homes don't just happen. They need some care, some thought, some work. - Aye, and a bit of love. - I'm going to London tonight. - Whatever for, child? - 'Cause I feel like it. Don't look at me like that, Mum. Don't take everything in case you change your mind. I won't do that. I won't feel you gone the same If I see your things around. Mum, can you lend us some money until I get my factory savings out? - Yes, love. - Ta. I'll have to scratch around a bit. Oh don't, Betsy-Jane, I was wrong. How can it be wrong robbing your husband? What's his is yours. He'd never forgive me. - Is there anything I could pawn? - Would he miss the piano? You've got to have the money for your Hilda! Stop it. Leave it alone, please. Besides, you'll never open it. You're too late. Bloody hell! And now for the dough. We mustn't leave fingerprints. - Put it back! - Have you gone mad? - Put it back, put it back I tell you! - What about your Hilda? Hang on a tick, don't you touch anything! Find a pawn broker. Get what you can on it, and give the money to our Hilda. London? Why, I can't think of another place on earth like Bolton. Here you are. - It'll help you out! - I don't want it. You gotta eat for two, now. Remember? I don't know for sure, do I? Just give me a minute to see my sister. Everybody keep singing! Flo, can you lend us some money? Oh yes, of course I can. How much do you want? I need about 30 pounds. Thirty pounds? Whatever for? I don't know how to tell you. I'm going to London tonight, I could do with it today. I'll go to the bank during the break. I'll just make it before three. You're not thinking of... - Oh, you're not, are you? - No. No, I won't do that. I'll tell you, missus, I'm not taking any more perishable goods, rings, watches, cameras, but nothing perishable. Give over, you'll perish before this! Just look at it. I'll tell you, I'm taking no more clothes. Finest Crombie cashmere, it is Crombie cashmere! Here. Feel at it, feel at it! Besides it's only for one day. All that lot had only come in for one day! Well, I must confess, I prefer a bit of cloth... Here, just try it on, come on! Will you be told! That's right. Oh my, you look something in that! And it'll keep your knees and things warm. It's funny how you miss the birds around. What birds? Oh, you mean Flo and Hilda? Aye, we neither use nor ornament. I'll be missing next. And why not? Aren't you a bit too fond of your mother's cooking? That won't keep me. Once I set me mind on going. No, it's for our Hilda. She doesn't want it now. She says she's got some. Oh. Could you get the coat out for me tomorrow? I'll go off then. I'll see if I can get it out tonight. - I know about pawn broker. - If only you could... Don't worry. I'll even pay the interest. Say, Dad, you don't wanna be late. I'll not be late for the Messiah. Are you putting a coat on? Just a rain coat. Well, go and get it, Wilf, Dad's raincoat. Sure. I say, Dad, what about putting your new overcoat on, eh, Mum? What a good idea, it might be cold coming home, eh, Mum? No, this'll do nicely, thanks. It would have been good christening for it, Dad, the Messiah. Son, when I listen to the Messiah, I stand there as though naked. Time and place no longer exists, let alone clothes. I see what you mean, Dad. I doubt it, lad. - Look. - What? You've a button off. So I have. Mother, that's not like you. What, what's not? Button off my raincoat. Should have put your new overcoat on, Dad, I told you. Will you shut up about my new overcoat? Nobody's going to notice a missing button. Nay, I'm sorry, son, you meant well. Come on, Wilf, up with you, I'll fetch it. Wilf? If the girls come around, Mother... Don't you go for that coat. - What's up, Mum? - I'll get it. - Look, I'll go and get it. - Stop interfering! I'll go and get it. You're not yourself, Mother, keep calm. Have faith, everything'll come right in the long run. - Are you all right, Mother? - Hey? Mum, I'll go round for our Hilda, bring her in once he's gone, eh? And you set round to Arthur's. Bring our Florence. All right, now, cheer up! Mother! Mother, I can't... Oh. It's all right, I've got it. It's all right, Mother. Daisy? "Dad, I'm sorry." Daisy... Hello, Mr. Crompton. Have you seen my Daisy? Have I what? - My wife Daisy, have you seen her? - No. Come to think of it, I did see a woman but she'd no coat on, wouldn't have been her. Where? Where? Going down the footpath to the canal. Canal? It's me, Daisy! What's going on? Oh, Rafe. Hold me. Here. Here. I'll hold thee, lass. - Have you seen Mum? - No, why? - She's gone. - Oh, come on. Hey, what do you mean gone? - Well, she's not anywhere about. - Hello. Hey, guess what our Hilda has just told me? Mum pawned Dad's new overcoat. I don't give a bloody damn about the overcoat. Or the desk, or the money. All I care about, all I've ever cared about is you and our four children. I understand that, Dad. I know they don't thank me, but he'd be a poor sort of father who went around looking for thanks from his children, a bit of love, happen, is as much as he can hope for if he's lucky. All the same in thought I've given to money had only one purpose, so long as we could pay our way in the world and hold up our heads as a family. My childhood... It was one long nightmare of debt collectors, money lenders, shopkeepers hammering at our door and dunning us. Had to keep the door locked all hours of the day, in case the bailiff should come in. I had to leave my school mates and slip off the backstreet and climb over the back gates. My mother... She told my father one lie after another. She had to. My father never knew what he was. I vowed it would never happen to me. It was a nightmare. But Dad, why didn't you tell me? - I'm ready, Harold, when you are. - Ready? You can't leave home like that, you nit. Why, what's wrong? You wouldn't get into a Salvation Army hostel like that. I wonder, would Dad mind if I borrowed his leather suitcase? Get it, I give you permission. Besides, we'll be gone by the time he gets back. Hey, you're not taking his alarm clock, are you? Of course I am. Who the hell will be waking us up in the morning if the old feller isn't around? I come in from school one day, and there were these two bailiff chaps sitting in our front place, playing cards. I went into our back kitchen, saw my mother. She had her head over the gas stove. She was trying to commit suicide. And that over a paltry few pounds. If the children only knew. They'd understand you better. Nay... I'm not begging to be understood by my own flesh and blood, it'll come to them in time when they've got families of their own to bring up. One night tending a sick child will tell them more than any words of mine. I think you'd be happier from now on, Dad, if you took us as God made us. The more you love your children, the more you expect of them. They can't always live up to it. Neither can I. Now... just think back, Mother. There were times when you used to go off herrings. You mean when I was...? Well, our Hilda can't be. If she can't, she must be a very unnatural young woman. I mean, she's such an innocent. Those are the very ones it happens to. I admit, Dad, it has crossed my mind once or twice since Friday. Wouldn't let myself think of it. Just couldn't. Hey, just come and have a look at the Cromptons. They look just like lovers. Hey Mum, look what the wind's blown in. Well, I found it. Found? You found it before it was lost, get it off! Would you say, it did something for me? I'd like to do something for you. Would you now? Such as what? What would you do, Dad, if she is? Do? I'll show you what I'll do. She needs all the love and protection a father owes his child. I'll see that she doesn't go off to London. Oh no... here, you can't take that. Why not? Look out, they're coming! - Who? - Mum and Dad, who'd you think? - Is she still in one piece? - I think so, look. I bet they've ganged up on us. I hear they do that in the last resort, husband and wife. Lets hurry up and get off the back way. Look, relax! We are leaving home, right? Nothing to worry about anymore. Perhaps you shouldn't leave the cases lying about, Harold. Ah, yeah, just sort of spring it on him, like. Good idea, Arthur. Yeah, very good. Well, here we go. Right. Watch this. I'll show him. Be ready to throw it away, Harold. Just in case. All right, love? No manners, son? Pass 'em around, can't you? Whatever has come over him? Where have you been, Mum? Your father took me for a walk by the canal. - Mother, they're all leaving home. - Aye, every one of us. Aye. We're all packed. Getting out at last. Eh, Wilf? Eh, Wilf? What? Oh, yes. Home is a place you can always come back to, when nobody else wants you. Good. Mother, don't catch cold. - Dad, - Eh? the boys have decided to leave home. How I envy them. I didn't think you had it in you. And our Hilda is going off to London tonight. Oh, Hilda is not going off to London tonight. I'm sure our Hilda hasn't got the heart to leave Mother and me now, just when you most need us. Right, Wilf? Come on. - Let's get the cases. - What for? - Oh... - Oh, yes. I'll miss you, but I don't blame you. The times I've reached that top corner on my way home and I've thought, if only I had the courage to turn the other way. You've never wanted to leave us, have you, Dad? I wasn't born married, son. There's no father alive who doesn't long to escape from his captivity now and again. Why I remember only last Friday coming through that door, I thought to myself they'll all be putting on their act, even to Mother. That frozen look of honesty she puts on after fixing the housekeeping accounts. Don't say you knew it all the time? Over the years, I've hardly been able to keep a straight face going through your figures. Do you know how much that window cleaner's cost this past month? Two pounds 14 and nine pence. It's a wonder there's any glass left. Right, well... shall we go, Florence? Where? To our place. I mean my mother's. We're getting married on Thursday morning. Congratulations, but this is only Monday. I suppose our Florence thought she'd stay at Arthur's 'till then. Well our Florence can't stay at Arthur's 'till then. One night away from home before marriage is quite enough. What do you mean, can't? Now look, Arthur, you've won one round, don't let it go to your head. Just think of the years Mother there must have looked forward to the day she'd see our eldest daughter walk out that door a bride. Well, if... if Dad thinks it's the proper thing to do... It'd save us moving your cases. - Go on, Wilf. - All right, I'm going! I borrowed your suitcase, Dad. I hope you didn't mind. No, not at all, what's mine is yours. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, Mum. - Goodbye love, God bless. - Goodbye, love. - Goodbye, Hilda. - Goodbye Wilf, look after yourself. Goodbye, Mum. Goodbye, Florence. You know, I can't imagine the home without our Wilf and Harold. Nay, it's bound to seem empty. I mean, they were like fixtures. Goodbye, Arthur. Right, well... Goodbye. Where are you going to, Harold? - Aye, where are we going? - Don't ask me. Well I'm not walking the streets all night. Mum, do you know any place we could go to? No love, ask your dad. Ask him. Dad, you don't happen to know anybody who'd take me and Harold in? Do you, Dad? No, sorry. Good homes are not easy to come by. We wouldn't be fussy, would we, Wilf? Just as long we had a roof. Mother, suppose I go instead of the lads? It'd be less of an upheaval. I could rough it better than them, they're not used to it. Here, you take these keys. I wouldn't hear of that, Father. Why not? Oh, why didn't you eat that bloody herring? I say, Mum, what do you say that we all give it another go, eh? All pull together, like. Another go? Your dad and I have no choice. It's all been the one go for us since we were blessed with a family. Right, Dad? Aye, you're tied to your children even if they're not tied to you. Even though it takes nearly a lifetime to bring 'em up, you can lose the lot over a weekend. You've not lost us, Dad. Has he, Wilf? Hmm? Not likely. Come on, where are you? What about you, Hilda? - Keys, Dad. - No. Anything that needs locking up with a key is not worth the trouble, not in your own home. Sorry, Dad. I know That my redeemer liveth And that He shall stand He shall stand At the latter day Upon the earth
