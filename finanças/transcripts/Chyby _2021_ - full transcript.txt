What's your name? Marcela. So you're Marcela? -How old are you? -18. And what's your thing, Marcela? -You mean in sex? -That's right, in sex. Me being on top, I guess. -With me being under? -With you being under. Take off your top and whatever's underneath. Chop chop. Right. Come on. -Do you like this? -I do. Now take off your trousers and undies. Come on. That's right. Come on, don't be shy. What's up? Right. Nice. Now turn around, Marcela, and show me your little cunt, okay? Come on. That's right. -Is this your thing too? -Yeah, too. It's a lovely little cunt. Now turn around and meet Leo. -Hi. -Hi. -You can call him bro. -Hi. -Come on, you two, stop giggling. -Sorry. -I packed a pie for you. -Come on, Mum. Take it. I don't eat this stuff anymore and Dušan has diabetes. And text me when you get there. No worries. -You won't, will you? -Maybe not. I'll bring him the stuff he forgets here when I go there on business. Fico! -Heel! -Yeah! -We'll keep in touch. Take care. -Bye. A friend of mine sends you this. He said he has shitloads of these. I told him you're into such stuff. Thank you. Next time you might bring some chick over. -Do you have a girlfriend at all? -Not at the moment. Your mum says you haven't had one for ages. Mum doesn't live with me, what does she know? -Aren't you into dudes? -What? I'm asking if there's a chance you might be homosexual. I understood the question. -It's just that you have no girlfriend. -I'm no faggot, okay? And I have no girlfriend because women suck. -Still, they do turn you on, right? -Of course they fucking do. -Have a safe trip. Take your pies! -Oh, right. Good. Bye. Take care. International express train from…. For fuck's sake! …will be delayed. The expected time of arrival is… The extent of the delay might change. -Shit. -Dear passengers, please excuse the delay. -Good evening. -Hello. Can I ask you for a lager, please? -Come on. -Nice shot. Emma! -Where did you learn this? -In kindergarten. Jarka, it's Emma's turn, not yours. -Your lager. -Thank you. No, no, no! But I fucking know that! I've known it for ages. Come on, Emma, stop it. Karel, the two of us are done playing. The game's over for us. I can tell fucking scoliosis. From afar! Karel, does Jarka have it? -Two in! -No, she doesn't. I know I do, but it doesn't show. You can see the stoop, can't you? You're such a stoop, Jarka. Do something about it. -Another round of six shots, okay? -Sure thing. Heading out on a trip? No. Have you just arrived, then? -From Slovakia. -I see. -Are you celebrating? -It's my birthday! Ding! Ouch. Happy birthday, then. Here you go. Thank you. Wait, please. A birthday present. -May I? -Sure. Wow, what is this? A succulent. -A succu-what? -…lent. A lithops. -Fine, it's a cactus. -Yay, a cactus! Hello! -Careful. -Sorry. It's just too cute. I know. It doesn't need too much water. It actually lives on air alone. -You mustn't flick it, though. -No flicking. -Nope. -No flicking. It blooms beautifully. And it's called "living stones.“ Well, thank you. You're welcome. My name is Tomáš. -I'm Emma, hi. -Where are the shots? -Wow, what is this beauty? A cactus! -No flicking. -Hi, I'm Jaruna. -I'm Tomáš, hi. -Give us a sec. -Are you two having a meeting? Jarka! Cut it, you attention whore, grab the shots and bring them over! -Have a nice evening. -Likewise. Friends from work. -What do you do? -I work at a supermarket. You? -Roofs, insulations, weatherization. -Is it hard work? In summer the roofs are baking hot, in the fall it's windy like hell, -my hands are covered with blisters. -Hands? Check them out. Yuck. It looks as if you were stubbing cigarettes out on them. Ouch. -It must hurt so much. -Not really. Would you let me stay over tonight? -You're pretty fast. -I missed my bus, you know. SOKOL SPORTS CENTER It took one hint, man, and I was in her flat. -A blowjob? -All the way, man. -How did you sneak off? -In the morning. -Hi! -Hi! -Hey there. -Hi. -Wait, did you fall asleep next to her? -I did go there to get some sleep. -I missed my bus, your phone was off. -Sorry, mate, at night I… It's okay. Whatever. You finally got laid. Jerking off was driving you nuts. What is this bullshit? -Thanks. -Thanks. -How are our Slovak brothers? -Fine. -Is your mum okay? -I guess. Good to hear that. Bottoms up, boys. You help me make my living. -She picked you up, right? -So what? That sucks. No sweet talks, no courting. I gave her a plant. -What plant? -A fucking lithops. -Hi. -Hi. Up all night to the sun? -Up all night to get some. -Up all night to get lucky. A present. -A cactus? -For you. Hi, Karel. Hi. -Emma, tell us. -I don't want to. Emma, fucking hell. -Did you like him? -I didn't. No muscles. I'm into those muscular no-necks. Jesus. -Stop staring! -What a dumbass. In the morning I gave him a chance to sneak out. And? He sneaked out. Ouch! -Easy, Mr. Kloc, it's a bit too much! -Bye. Bye-bye! Thanks! What… No! Get out of here. Go, go, go. Off you go. Come on. Good night. Goodbye! -See ya, mate. -See ya! You're driving tomorrow. -For fuck's sake! -I can't. Your old man's driving, mate! We'll do the calculations later. Sure, no worries. This stuff is our daily bread. -Hello. -Hello. Okay, fine. Bye-bye. -Wake up, man! -You're right on time. As always. -Do you have anything to eat or drink? -We'll grab something in the village. My daughter will bring you refreshment. She has shit to do anyway. Ilona! Give those gentlemen something to eat and to drink. Bye! Bye, take care! -Hello. -Hello. Push it over. -I've brought you a snack. -Hello there! It's really sweet of you but climb back down, will you? No need to be such a chicken. This young lady is a big girl. What are you, an idiot? You wanna be responsible for her when she falls down? You'd better climb down. We'll bring you the basket later. Alright, then. -Mind your steps! -Don't worry. Shit, did you see that? You need to work the looks right from the start. -Rubbish, mate. -Hey, are you in love, or what? -What? -With a chick from a bar? -What fucking chick? -Fuck me. -She must have sucked you off real fine. -Like fuck she did. I'm just knackered. -I hope you didn't give her your number. -Nope. -You know what happened to me in Brno? -Man, I forgot you're from Brno. Nobody's perfect. This girl just clung to me in a bar, totally buying all my clever bullshit, and in the morning she was standing right next to the bed with a backpack. I talked my way out of it, but I gave her my number. I'm such a dick. Emma? Hi. Hi. I wasn't sure if this was the right address. I just wanted to apologize to you for sneaking out like that. Alright, then. That eye…? I got into a fight. Do you like to fight? -Only when it's inevitable. -Who was it inevitable with? -With my old man. -Did he survive? No. No? -No. -You mean he didn't? -I mean he did. -Thank God. Sorry. Do you want me to get out of here? I'll go to the bathroom and leave it up to you. Sorry. -She likes to throw plates. -Fuck off, you asshole! In a while, we'll smell some weed from the balcony. That's what he likes. Really? I might befriend him. -Do you like weed? -Sure. You have some? Yep. -You do? When can I move in? -Anytime. It's nice to share the rent. -Was it too much? -What? -All this talking. -Not at all. -Your train is gone by now. -I'm here by car. -Tough luck anyway. -Emma. -No way. -Come on. -Give it to me. -No! -I must go to work in the morning. -Tough luck. No work this time. And I have an afternoon shift! I called in sick. Why didn't you just say: "I spent a night with a beautiful girl and then I took her out for breakfast“? -You don't know Igor. -I don't. Where is my ham and eggs? No idea. You've wolfed it down! I haven't. -No way. -Come on, it's mine! -No, that can't be. -Oh, no. How many girls have you had? Not too many. It's been ages since you had one, isn't it? No. Why? Did I come too fast or what? No. Five. You mean you've slept with five or dated five? I date girls. I don't just sleep with them. I see. So what's going on between us? Because I'm not dating you. Well, there you go. Maybe I've given it some thought and started to do things differently. -How differently? -I don't know. Perhaps it's better to just sleep around because… once the girl takes to her heels, there's no need to grieve. -Why do your girls cut and run? -How should I know? Perhaps they don't like my plants. -Your plants? -Yes. -Oh, right. The succulent! I know. -Exactly. But they do like geraniums, and that is not my kind of plant. How many guys have you had? Just like you. Five. -Five relationships. -I wasn't asking about relationships. I asked how many guys you've had. I like boys. But I don't sleep with every boy I like. -Why so serious? -Yeah. That might be yet another reason why girls keep leaving me. I'm way too serious. -Alright. Thanks. -You're welcome. Wait. I… I just wanted to tell you that… I really liked being with you. Yesterday and before. So I thought… I'd like to see you again. I mean no strings attached. Why don't we give it a shot, right? Of course, if you're up for it too. I… I don't know, I mean… -Will you give me a call? -Alright. Six zero seven… Seven five eight… Two four seven. -Got it. -Okay. -Take care. -You too. GRILLED SAUSAGES NO SERVICE ON THE TERRACE -Hello, Mr. Kloc. -Hello. -Four sausages, please. -Four? -Better make it five. -You're right. There. -Anything else? -A piece of that bacon too. -The smaller one? Or the bigger one? -No, the small one's fine. -Anything else? -Hi, Franta. -Hi. -Hi, babe. -I'm going for a beer, okay? -Just one? -I'll be home at seven. -Fine. Bye, darling. Bye. -Sure you don't want the bigger one? -No, thanks. Fine. There's something wrong about that girlfriend of yours, Tom. -Just shut up already, okay? -How's the business going, lads? -Our champ here sucks. -What? You're like a dog chasing after a bitch in heat. -You can't even enjoy a friendly pint. -What are you talking about? -I'm sitting here, enjoying it. -Are you? -But you had to ask for permission. -Permission? I just informed her. -Informing means asking. -I'd inform Emma relentlessly as well. Me too! Jesus, yet another dog. It's just a friendly way of pointing out that you bit off more than you can chew. What's so funny about it? I care about you, that's all. Do you find it weird? Heel! Come on. Tomáš? I'm transporting goods to Pilsen so I thought I'd surprise you. You did a good job there. But this is not just a random visit, right? Your mum and I are getting married. What? Why are you gawking at me? Did you think we'd live our secret lovers' life forever? No, I didn't. It's fine. I just… Shit. Just a small do. Nothing overly romantic. The voice of reason is calling. -Taxes, pension and whatnot. -You could have called or sent an email. I wanted to see your shocked face. You'll be my best man. Yes, that's exactly the face. You're asking me to be your best man? It wasn't a question. Right. It was a long ride, I need a nap. In the morning I must be in Pilsen. -Hi. -Hi. Something to make your nest smell nice. -This wasn't necessary. -Where did you pick her up? -Why do you care? -I don't. Your mum does. -You're an idiot. -And this. -You've already told her? -Yep. -Bye. -Wait! Wait! -I'm supposed to take a photo of Emma. -Come on! Mama wants her picture. Hello, how are you? -And how are you? -Okay. Mum? Oh, God, no. Mum! Mum, stop! Mum! Mum! -Come here! -What's wrong with you? How many times have I asked you not to ambush me like this? -I've already lost a job because of you. -It's not true. It is! Because of you and your filthy stuff. What do you want? -Mum, I have a boyfriend. -Lovely. It's not like I met a guy at a disco. -I pity him! -Don't be mean! I'm not reproaching you for who you are or for… -Who you were. -How dare you? Next time you want to see me, call my phone. I don't wish to be seen with you. I'd better go, then. -Does he know? -Who? That boyfriend of yours. I saw my mum today. Earlier I told you we've lost touch. I guess I should explain why. Are you sure I need to know? I think you should. When I was 18, I met… -this… guy… -Wait, wait, please. Look, I must tell you now or I'll never have the guts to do it. I don't care about your ex-boyfriends. But I have to tell you. I know you had a life before me. I had mine too. Here and now is all that matters. I don't care what was before. I care about what's next. And if your family doesn't want to be a part of it, I won't push them. I love you. Couldn't you care a little about your appearance? -I do care. -Do you? How could you pull a proper job -with such a flabby belly? -That's rich coming from you. I don't need a six-pack. I have a brain unlike you, you idiot. You have no brain, so you need the six-pack. Last time, I almost felt sorry for you. Look. -Fuck me! -Screw her, man. Wait, I got some questions to ask. -Come on, she was so lame. -She was good, man. -I'd rather fuck a dead fish than this. -She was good. Like hell she was. Finally. -Can we go? -Aren't you hungry? -The fuck are you talking about? -I am hungry. Okay? So he said he was 18 and I said he's lying, "I could tell he was 15.“ Then Karel came, this guy pulled out his ID about half an hour later and it turned out he was 30. He was taking the piss out of me. -Men are pricks. -Totally. -And how's your life in the country? -Me? I'm fine. It looks like a permanent thing. -What do you do there? -I work in a shop like you, guys. Except there I know all my customers by name. That's cool. Check out that neck. -Jeez, what a bull, right? Megacool. -Awesome. -Hi, honey. -What are you doing? I decided to go to the pub. -Girls say hello. -Thanks. What are you guys up to? Gossiping, drinking wine, and then we'll go to a disco. -Come on, let's fuck! -Piss off. -I'm thinking about you. -Are you? Me too. I'll call you later, okay? Bye. Hi. Hi. What is this, a kid's party? You remember Ilona, right? -Vaguely. -We made a roof for her father. Oh, right. You made us a snack. That's right, yeah. -Was it tasty? -Yeah. Right, there you go. -Thanks. -A toast to us! Cheers! -Cheers! -Hi. Are you married? I'm not telling you anything. I've been trying to reach you on the phone. -Business matters, of course. -I lost my phone. -So you've got a new one. -Yeah. I've got a new one. Are you two making videos? Come on. You always enjoyed doing it in front of the camera. How's your business going? With that one? She's a junkie. And thick as a brick. Why did you actually leave us? I'm racking my brain. I mean… We all are actually racking our brains. -You want to know the truth? -Sure. It's just wrong. That's all. This is just some momentary moral fluctuation. You can never make that kind of money in a shithole like this. And what happens when I turn 30? -What then? I… -Cut this esoteric bullshit. What am I? -A possessive slaveholder? -Of course not. You're a pimp. -I'm not, am I? -Yes, you are. You're the kind of pimp who likes to use emotions instead of force. Oh, I see. I guess it's finally clicked. Sure. Now I know. All that time you were crazy about me. -Well, I'd better go. -Come here! -Let go! -No, listen to me. Do you know what pimps do to their chicks who wanna cut and run? They scar their faces. You know why? So no other dude ever cared about them. Am I like that? Have I done anything like that? Tell me. I am no pimp. What was that? -Just a guy I know. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Cheers. -Cheers. Party hard, right? That pool of yours is freezing cold. Are we going in, or what? Are you having troubles with my whirlpool? Let's fix it! So how's the water? Sorry. Sorry. What's wrong? Sorry. Sorry. Man… -I'm sitting in the front. -No way! I pay, I get to sit there. Come on, Jarka. -Can I smoke in there? -Yes, you can. Fuck no. -Good evening. -Hi. Can we smoke in here? Let's do this. -Miss? -Yes? Hello. Could you spare a moment for me? -Why? -Where are you going? -Home. -Home? Do you have a boyfriend? -Yes, or no? -Not at the moment. You don't? That's good. That's even better. Do you like money? You're so cute. Come over here. So no one can see us. Let me touch you, okay? Jesus, they're beautiful. That's right. What a lovely little cunt. …economic issues, but the only problem… Is it okay if we do it like this? I'll let you know before I come. You'll kneel and I'll come on your face. BROUMY TOWNHALL -Good morning. -Good morning. Tom? Tom? Hi, Mum. Sure thing, I'll be there. And Emma too, of course. Get to work. Sweep the roof before it starts pissing down. Yeah. -What's wrong? -Nothing. I'm reading. -Could you just let me read, please? -Sorry. Thanks. -Is it entertaining at all? -Yeah. And can I get a kiss? Kiss me. Emma. Once more. Bride and groom. You have decided to seal your relationship with a marriage. A marriage is not just a joint journey through life. A marriage also means a joint struggle with life. On your application for a marriage licence, you both stated that you are not aware of any obstacles to entering into marriage, that you are acquainted with each other's health condition, morals… I got it! -Four! -Cheers, then! -What are you doing? -Come on. No, I don't want to dance. No. You look pretty today, you know? I have to go to the loo. Tom, have fun! I am having fun, aren't I? Drive safe. -Thank you. -Thank you for coming. Bye! Good night, thanks a lot. -Bye. -Come, let's go. Sleep well. And drive safe! Tom. Let's go. Let's get you into bed, you piglet. Come on. Come on. What are you doing? Tom? Come on. We're going to sleep. Tom? -What are you doing? -Making a video. Is this some kind of a stupid joke, or what? Wait! And what is your thing, Marcela? You mean in sex? Well… -Who knows, we might beat this one. -And me down? We'll get even more thumbs up. People leave their comments here. They actually review your fucking. If you wanna say you were young and needed money, then just shut up. Where did you find this? You should clear your browsing history if you're so keen to watch yourself. How many videos have you made? I've found seven of them but that can't be all, right? Did you enjoy it? Did you? I meant to tell you. Okay? -You shouldn't have watched that. -You shouldn't have done that, stupid cow! Anyway, you searched for porn? Why did you search for porn? Why did you search for porn? Why does everyone watch porn? -Not everyone, no. -Everyone does and everyone denies it. Are you the same as everyone else? I fucked Ilona. Ilona who? I fucked her like a whore. Come on, boy. Where is Tomáš? Well, we had a small quarrel last night and he… I don't know where he is. You are not from Kublov, are you? No, I am not. -So where from? Tomáš never told me. -I'm from Příbram. Did you also work as a shop assistant there? No, I… I dabbled in all kinds of things. This and that. I see. Excuse me. Yes? Tomáš, where are you? We've been waiting for you. What? You mean you're not coming here at all? Tomáš, hello? He's at the train station. Oh, right. I'd better go to him, then. Emma? I apologize for him. This is really embarrassing. Thanks for everything. Well? -Well, what? -Come on, man, just… Can't you see it yourself? Yeah. Here you are. -What the fuck is wrong with you? -Why? What happened between you and Ilona? She refused to say so I'm asking you. You're shitting me! What if Emma learns about this? -She already knows. -What? I told her. Shit, man. How did she take it? She'll survive. -Hi. -Hi. Four? Four. -What were you doing? -What? -Oh, that. A bike crash. -I see. That'll be all. Thirty. Bye. -Come on, more beer, give it here. -You have no money… Fuck off, mate… Think of something… -Aren't you a bit too picky? -I'll give you a tenner. Not enough. Fine, I'll give you 25. But we'll do it on the table. There's some meal in the fridge. You want me to heat it up for you? Oh, no, not that! Mr. Svoboda! Yes? Could you come down for a moment? Hang on. How can I help you? Shit. I… I'm awfully sorry. He threw up into our sandpit. I'm really, really sorry. Get up, you fucker. Get up! Come here, you idiot. -Don't fucking touch me! -Stop it! Such a sweet deal. Kilometres of rubber on that roof! You're not gonna puke again, are you? -She did porn. -Who? Emma. Holy shit. Who has never recorded his chick during sex? -It's on the internet. -What? -I said it's online! -Yeah? All the things you can imagine. Actually, much more than that. This tattooed fucker plays with her and sometimes his mates join in. -You're fucking kidding me. -No. That's heavy. That sounds pro. Just the idea of… All those dudes wanking over her videos at this very moment. Igor? -We're friends, right? -Sure. You'll keep it to yourself, then. I don't know what to do. I told you she was weird. And now the puzzle is complete. Your sweet little Emma is a proper bottomless cock-a-gulper. Screw her, mate. Our skilled little Emma. Shit. Haven't you seen Tomáš? His phone is off and he's not in the pub. He's here. He got drunk and passed out. Come in. He's upstairs. I'll shower him in the morning, feed him and send him home, okay? I feel like things have been rough between you lately. Can I help? Tomáš is a bit unstable. No wonder. It runs in the family, you see? He tends to cling to his girlfriends and that's not very healthy. Chicks get either bored or scared. -What the fuck are you doing? -And you? Cut the crap. I saw how you enjoy that. -What did you see? -Everything. Tomáš told me. Shall we make a deal? Or should I tell everyone? You'll be a real star here. Well? Will you be good to me? No one will ever know. What would you like to do with me? Do you want me to piss on you? Or would you rather piss on me? Should we wake Tom up so you both can take me? Stop it! You think you're this big macho with a massive dick? -A bad ass who fills up every wet hole? -Shut up! You're a clown, Igor. A self-absorbed clown. A lame loser like you can never make me go wet. What now? Will you pull down your shorts and jump on me? My man is in the room upstairs, Igor. Move over. Hello. -Hello. How can I help you? -Hi. -Hi. -Hi, what would you like? -I'd like a sausage. -What sausage? I don't know. What kind do you like? -Excuse me? -I asked you what kind you like? -I don't know. They're all tasty. -Are they? I'll take the spicy one, then. -Have a nice day, see ya. -Bye. Tom, I know you told Igor. I needed to talk to someone. It's just too awful. The night you didn't come home I went looking for you to Igor's place. He was watching those videos when I came there. He wanted me to sleep with him. He was just teasing you. -It's true. -Igor is my friend. No one knows anything and Igor won't tell. He promised. He threw himself at me. While you're sleeping upstairs. You're lying. All those videos, they were made in my life long before you. I would never cheat on you. Do you want to leave? He won't keep it to himself and the locals will eat me alive. So you're leaving? I want you to come with me. Are you mad? -But I can't stay here. -Sure. You fuck everything up and go. Vodka. How about hello? -Was Igor here? -I don't know. Holy cunt! Get up, get up! For fuck's sake… You're a proper beauty. Why didn't you tell me Emma'd been looking for me here? Did you watch the videos? -I only took a glimpse. -Who did you tell? No one. -Who did you fucking tell? -No one. I'm no scumbag! -Did you want to fuck her? -For fuck's sake, mate… Did you? I was shitfaced, mate. I'm sorry. Shit. Emma, there are no more buses today. Yeah, I know. -Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah. You're soaking wet. Come to my place. Come on, I'll help you out. -A splash of rum in your tea? -No, thank you. I'll have some. No, thank you. So what happened? Did Tomáš throw you out of the house? Why? -Did you cheat on him? -No. You're better than my ex, then. She'd go downtown to screw around while I was working my ass off. I've never been lucky with ladies. So I started trying online dating. Have you ever tried online dating? No. A photo never shows you what the person is like on the inside. What matters is the light. And stuff. Right? I'd like to go lie down if you don't mind. Well… Alright, then. Sure. May I? Yeah. Sorry. Wait, I'll help you out. -Are you alright? -Yes. And this too. Right. -Thank you. -Take care. Hi… -Karel? -Hi, Emma. Is Věra at home? Věra! -Are you coming in? -Yeah. Let me help you. -Come in. -Thanks. I thought you were into those muscular no-necks. -Now Karel? -We were both left on the shelf. Have you given up your flat? Shit, that's just so typical. You must keep your options open, otherwise men totally use you up. Things took a slightly different turn. -Did you cheat on him? -No. So what happened? Do you love him? He's nice. What if you learned he did something really nasty? What do you mean by nasty? Something he was doing before, but not anymore, and now he's sorry about it and ashamed. I don't know. I guess I'd need to know what it was. Let's say it was porn. You mean Karel? Holy shit. Wait, your man did porn? No, not him. I don't mind Emma staying for a few days. We can't turn our back on such a nice and pretty friend. Right? And I could duff up the scumbag who gave you the shiner, right? I will. I guess I'd better go. -What? Did I say something wrong? -No. Just leave it. -Hi. -Hello. Good day to y'all. -Hi. -Hi. Gentlemen? A trivia question for the brainy ones. Say the name of the actress and win a trip to Whoreistan. Iggy, man, that's actual porn. Doesn't this chick remind you of someone? -Shit, you're right. -Shit, yeah, it's the… -Young Kadlec's girlfriend! -You bet! Marcela Delight. Pavel, come here. You must see this. Not this. I won't have it here. Go sit back to your tables. -What're you doing? -Shame on you! He's your friend. He's no friend! And give me back my laptop. Fuck off. -That's theft! -A theft? Come and get it, then. Come on. Take that thing back home and don't you ever drag it in here. Now get out. Get out! Listen. Igor played this video to the guys. You'd better get ready for some smartass talk. Wait. Wait. I… I live alone. You know that, right? You wanna know how I deal with it? I visit porn sites more often than my own fridge. So I recognized her pretty soon. -Okay. -Hey. Wait. Tom! -Hello? -Mum? How long can I stay? For the weekend, not a day longer. And we'll be leaving the flat separately. Here you go. -Thanks, bye. -Bye. -Thank you. -Thank you, bye. Bye. -Hi girls. I've brought paper cups. -Put them in the back, please. -Sure. -Thank you. -Hi. -Thanks. Hi. How do you commute, Emma? By bus and then walk across the field? I could give you a lift sometime. If you want. Thanks. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Why don't you come over to my pub for a proper pint? 360 crowns, please. -Good evening. -Good evening. [speaking Ukrainian] Fico! Come out, boy! Come on! Come out now. Hey! What the fuck? What's this? Are you fucking nuts? This place stinks like a baboon's ass. And where is Emma? She did porn. -And you kicked her out? -She left. -Did you watch it? -Yes. -You shouldn't have. -Now I know that too. Has she been doing it recently? I hope not… I don't know. The videos I saw could have been about five years old. So what the fuck is your problem? It's a long time ago. Why did she do it? It's quick money. -But why would she quit, right? -How the fuck should I know? Maybe she fell in love. With some asshole. When you're in love you act like an idiot. Now you're acting like a loser. I hate guys who pity themselves and think the world is unfair. Get your ass up and clean this mess. If you don't want her, stop thinking about her. If you want her, call her. If she wanted to do it she would instead of wasting her time in this shithole. I'm going to take a dump. I don't want to get stuck there. One more year and I'm off. -I've got my plans. -What plans?

Anyway, you can make good money. -What does he do there? -He's a croupier. He says girls are really good at this. Girls find it easier to resist betting and gambling. Did you know that? -I MISS YOU! -WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME? ARE YOU OKAY? Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Really? Okay, I'd like to. When? Your boyfriend was looking for you. I thought you should know. He said you never answer his calls. -I was kind of worried about you. -I'm fine. This is disgustingly romantic but I decided to go for it. Come off it, Věra. It's your cactus. For fuck's sake! He knows what you did and he's looking for you anyway. Sorry. -Your coffee. -Thanks. -Here you are. -Thank you. -How is Karel? -He's an idiot. -But you're still together? -Yeah, we are. NA SLOVANCE RESTAURANT Do they play for money? Do they at least play for money? That's why he plays at marriage. Hello. What's he doing here? -Hi. -Hello. Quite a shocker to see him here. -Hi. -Take a seat. Hi. -Right, here you go. -Thank you. You alright? Listen. Sorry for beating you up. It shouldn't have happened. Sure.
