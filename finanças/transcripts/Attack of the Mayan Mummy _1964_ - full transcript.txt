Sit down, Doctor, make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. - Cigar? No, I believe not, thanks. Is there something I can get you? No, thank you. I am quite alright the way I am. As a matter of fact I just finished a rather large lunch. You are not celebrating, I hope. Celebrating? I'm afraid I don't follow. Uh, excuse me. That was a little below the belt. I was referring to your envious position of being personally inside the story. You have that rare opportunity that comes all too seldom to any of us. To scoop this as well as the other newspapers on that television broadcast of yours. By the time we go to press and hit the streets, the story will be almost a follow up. Ha-ha. Well I'm afraid I won't be broadcasting the story to anyone except you yourself. You see, I've decided to give up my radio and television work completely. I should never have gone into it in the first place. I realize now from things that have come to pass that a scientist is best suited to sit in front of a microscope. Not a camera. At least one of my temperament that is. - Can I use that in a story? - Yes, if you like. You sound to me Dr. Munson, as if you are completely closing out a chapter. As if everything that has happened has left you almost with a sense of shame and I may add a certain degree of bitterness. Well, I'm not bitter. I feel certain that all of that is far in the past. Shame? Yes. That is a good description of men who allow themselves to be carried away with dreams of riches, and create violence and death in the wake of what might have been perhaps, tremendous discoveries of science. Certainly you don't feel responsible for every mistake generated by others in your profession? Ha-ha. If you did, you'd have yourself a full-time job, and never get it done at that. Let me put it this way. You have a certain code of ethics that you adhere to in running a newspaper. You don't print a story that you feel would be false or misleading. Do you? A newspaper serves the public. It is a different situation entirely. And you feel that science doesn't? Well, ultimately, of course it does, but men like yourself are given the freedom of choice in their own motivations. There is where the difference is. All newspapers conform to the same basic premise. And there is no need for any personal analysis, even when you are hired out by some other publication. In the field of science, however, personal implications are likely to vary all the way from, uh, well, duality to complete opposites. I'd say there is a tremendous difference between, well, say yourself and your Dr. Janning. After all, he is not here to give me the story, but you are. Well, I can't deal too harshly with Dr. Janning when I know that it was my own doing that got him involved in the first place. I understand that he volunteered to work with you. Perhaps he did. Perhaps, we all volunteered at the beginning. But I can tell you one thing. Most of the doctors at Cowan Research would have pulled out fast if they realized where the events would lead them. Uh, Dr. Munson, suppose you start at the beginning. Now, take it easy and try to remember everything that lead up to last night. I believe it is important for me to fully understand each detail in its proper perspective. Reporting is, as you said yourself, a responsibility of complete accuracy. I'm afraid it won't be difficult for me to remember everything that has taken place. Not at all. Well, it all began ... when conscientious work and hypnotic regression. That is, regressing in individual past, their present life to previous incarnations. It began to interest science and it was studied by myself and the rest of the staff at Cowan Research Foundation. The Foundation, as you know, was owned by my sister who was widow of Professor Cowan before she married Edmond Redding. Redding was made head of staff just before my sister was killed in a jet crash. Well, certain inconsistencies in my sister's will pointed out that both myself and Redding would be in complete control of the Foundation in the case of her death. Now, after a lengthy court battle, Redding won out, and I was expelled from the staff because of certain animosities that grew out of the proceedings. Well, I am happy to say now that it appears that the Foundation will be reverted back into my own control. I was, of course, very grieved being kept out of the work and the lab that I had been a part of for so many years. And I was also very concerned about my nephew Timmy who was left now with only a stepfather to take care of him. All of my experimental notes were left at the Foundation, and I felt somewhat cheated! And rather badly over losing my key subject of the hypnosis, Ann Taylor, who had the marvelous capacity to go into the trance state and recall her previous life with an ancient Mayan civilization. We found that she could almost recall the exact location inside a still existing Pyramid of a possible huge fortune of ancient gold. Well, the phenomenal results Redding had with Ann Taylor was a subject of much inquiry around the world, and pressure was put on Cowan Research to make its findings known to the science association. Redding agreed to a symposium at which time he would explain to everyone in detail, and open the case before the entire association. This occurred in early September, on a Friday afternoon, just preceding the labor day weekend. (Clapping) Gentlemen, Dr. Edmond Redding. (Clapping) As Redding began to speak, it became immediately apparent that he had a change of heart and decided it was in his own interest to withhold the information everyone had come to hear. This was taken with great surprise by those who had traveled thousands of miles to attend the lecture. He boldly brought out the fact that even though he and his staff believed firmly in the open transfer of new information in the field in which he himself had learned because it had been built upon the shoulders of all who had worked before him. His present results would have to remain within the confines of his own group. Little time had elapsed before Redding found himself challenged openly to reveal his reasons for holding back the findings and new understandings of the Mayan civilization they knew had been brought about through his months of work in hypnosis with Ann Taylor. He was asked on several occasions questions that were basic in nature and these were answered to a degree that would inhibit the further points that would naturally follow. When he was literally pressured into directly pointed corner of questioning, Redding simply refused to answer. In expressing his deep regret that most of those present would regard his decision in the matter as grossly a selfish one, he insisted it was justified. The fact remained that all findings were at this point inconclusive because of the lack of time he would need to verify factors that were inconsistent with the geographical standards of the pyramid in Yucatan. It became more and more clear to the men who spoke out their disbeliefs of everything Redding had to say that there must have developed within the group at Cowan a tremendous motivation for their secrecy. There was no doubting the fact that the motivation such as this was the age old plague of man's lust for that ever appearing treasure of gold. If this great fortune were to be uncovered by a group dedicated to science, and particularly, members of the association, every research lab in existence should be allowed to share in the actual search. Redding maintained stubbornly that his interest was primarily that of proving or disproving the statements of Miss Taylor in her hypnotized state as a Mayan princess, and the reference to hidden chambers within the pyramid was not in effect necessarily pertaining to gold. The meeting was closed quietly with Dr. Redding assuming an attitude of rather composed indifference to men who had for years supported his work. Thank you. Sit down, John. You must be tired after so much flying. I hope I'll be able to say the trip was worthwhile. You know, I'm not usually and angry man, no matter what the circumstances, but I'll say this farce of Dr. Redding's today has been enough to upset my insides. - Care for a drink? - No thank you. I had an ulcer flare up the day before I left Hong Kong. What with the long flight and food from stop over hotels, it was giving me trouble even before I heard Redding talk. Now it is really beginning to hurt. You ought to let me check it out for you. I 'am still practicing medicine you know. - No, I didn't. - Oh yes. I work every Monday and Friday at a local clinic. I think it is a good idea to keep up with the new developments at the level of actual operation. You know, you haven't changed a bit since you actually carried me through medical school. That is a long time to maintain the same values. I admire it very much. And you? -Me? - Mm hm. Well, I've accepted the fact that I am only referred to Dr. Janning, not professor Janning as I once hoped would be the case. I'm afraid I dropped personal ambition years ago. And realized that this so called Dr. Janning wasn't in essence a Dr. at all in the same sense as you and some of my other friends. I came to the conclusion that my real talent lies in the field of promoting research. Making it possible for others to get the Job done. Well, administrative work is just as important - as slides under microscope. - Well, perhaps. - What about science reporting? - Oh, that. Now don't tell me that you caught my television - stunt in Hong Kong. - No, it was in England. Well, I didn't realize we were spread out that much, but for the record, let me explain by saying that any work that I have been doing in front of a microphone is just merely a stop gap. Most certainly not a career. It was a job that was offered to me and I accepted. You see when I was severed from Cowan I unfortunately found myself faced with the pressures of everyday that effect all of us. The most consistent one being financial. Ha-ha. I figured as much, and that is precisely why I am not going back to Hong Kong. You're not? Well, not for a while yet anyway. Well, you may call me a mercenary, an opportunist perhaps, but the fact is that things have been most difficult for us at the lab in Hong Kong. We have been in financial trouble for some time. Now it is my job to righten the ship, and at the same time map out a course that my researchers can follow. Now I believe I can do that, and at the same time map out a similar course for you. Are you referring to the possibility of uncovering Mayan gold? Oh, I believe it is a bit more than a possibility. This girl, what is her name? - Ann Taylor. - Oh yes, Taylor. Apparently she is the key to the real issue, not Cowan Research. If you could only persuade her to break away from Redding somehow or other, but well, I suppose you have done everything in that direction. Well, I wrote you a detailed history report on how I first found out about her ability to recall her past life under just mild hypnosis. It was because of my excitement and encouragement that she consented to let me take her to see Redding, and also because she was very aware of the fact, the same as all of us, that he holds the honor of being top man in his field. Her confidence has remained very much the same. Both herself and a small sister live right there on the premises. I'm sure that nothing could persuade them to leave. Oh. Well, then it seems a new channel of thinking is in order. I've already effected it. - You have? - Mm hmm. Now tell me honestly if you could use some help. Oh, that goes without saying, but how long could you stay away from your own base? There is absolutely no telling how much time would be involved. Most certainly no assurance of success. Leave the gambles up to me. Both on the amount of time and the chances of getting our hands on that gold. You realize of course that I would want to share in it. Well, there wouldn't be any other reason for you to get involved. When you told me about your financial problems, my thought was how I might be able to help you. Yes, I'd be glad to share 50-50. If there is anything to share. If these stockpiles, or even one of them could be located, it would represent such wealth that could actually effect the gold standard. A leak of information is a definite possibility, but what they don't know is that the leak will not occur after they make the search of the pyramid as they fear, but that it has already begun to flow in a steady stream of information directly into my office. - You have someone on the staff? - Not exactly, but almost that. Well, if this source is accurate then you should know precisely the date they plan to leave for the Pyramids. I don't believe that I will need any help to learn of that. It will probably be carried by every newspaper. Redding knows that he won't be able to keep his activities a secret with regard to anything like a plane trip, and by the same token he knows that nobody would follow him into the pyramid. Because he would be aware of their presence and simply hold off on the search until he was alone. My plan is to learn of the developments just as though I were actually going along with them. In all justification, you should be. Well if I didn't truly believe that I'd drop the entire thing. I'm sure you would. As for myself, I can't claim to be drawn by anything quite so scrupulous. You remember I did mention to you that you might call me an opportunist. Well, now let's not think about it like that. You're one of the best qualified men I know when it comes to getting any certain thing done. Well, you may become somewhat shocked at some of the methods that are sometimes necessary in the world of competition. I'm still well connected in this city with people who deal with business that is sometimes rather sticky, If it should tum out that I need their help on the project, I hope you won't become alarmed. No, I won't interfere with your judgment. Ahh, good. That should simplify things a great deal. Now, getting back to cases. If your friend over at Cowan is not a member of the staff, who is he then? (Laughs) Well, he is my nephew Timmy. A rather bright teenage boy who has been loyal to me ever since I had to leave. Timmy wasn't favored when my sister married Redding, and when she died, he was left not only without a mother, but with a stepfather that he had never really taken to. Redding of course never had the time to give the boy the companionship to overcome the usual stepson problem. I believe that I have been closer to Timmy for years than anyone else. He was positively shattered when I had to leave the group. But you stayed in close contact? Oh, not openly. Well, if Redding realized the extent of our relationship he would cut Timmy off from the work as a security measure. - But how do you see him? - Hmm, Timmy has a girlfriend. I, uh, reach him by calling her. She sets up the meetings. As a matter of fact, I'm due to set up an appointment right now. I'm rather eager to learn of Redding's feelings after what happened today and what his next move might be. What I didn't know at the time What I didn't know at the time was the boy found he would be unable to get out of the house that night and keep the appointment. Timmy was instructed to go to his room and stay there. A mild protest was to no avail as Timmy knew from past experiences. His stepfather was a firm individual in a matter in which he held conviction. The men discussed every possible obstacle in the dangerous move Redding had suddenly decided upon. This move had been delayed several times previously out of fear of possible physical harm effecting Ann Taylor. In one mind there was uncertainty and much doubt that this night should be the one in which would bring about the maximum depth of her Mayan existence. Redding told of his responsibility towards everyone involved and of his feeling that if he should allow himself to be influenced by outside opinions or for that matter, even members of the staff, then all their work could fail due to indecision which in his mind was far worse than any research mistake. Redding himself was as fearful as any of the possible damage that they could bring about to the nervous centers of Ann Taylor. In the careful consideration that time was all important and knowing that each individual including Ann Taylor herself had prepared themselves, Redding reaffirmed his decision and announced that they would go ahead as planned. (Music/Dancing) Hi. Sorry I'm so late. - This is Lynn. - Hi. Hi. I was beginning to get a little worried. - Where is Timmy? - Oh he won't be here. - Boy, what a hassle. - Hassle? Can I have a coke or root beer or something? Yeah, we had to walk all the way from Broadway. Oh, waitress! Um, bring us a couple of cokes. Um, is something wrong with Timmy? Oh, Timmy is alright. That's okay. She knows about everything. - She helps me all the time. -Oh, I see. Things really got fouled up tonight. Yeah, Dr. Munson, I hope we won't be getting ourselves into trouble with this messenger routine. If it weren't for Timmy, I wouldn't be running all over half the town. Believe me. Well, I'm sure that your efforts will be rewarded. I know that Timmy appreciates your help as much as I do. Now, now tell me what happened. Well, I phoned tonight, just after you called, and at first I couldn't even get him on the line. One of the doctors told me he had gone to bed. Well I know Tim and he is not about to go to sleep anywhere near that early. (Laughter) So I insisted on talking to him, and finally I heard his voice on one of the extensions. - He gave me the surf jingle. - The what? The surf jingle. It's what I always give you. Sure, and when Timmy gives it to me it means to dummy up and not say anything. You know, like a password. A what? - What? - Well, besides that, I knew someone was listening in on the other line. So I just made some small talk and then hung up. After that we had to take a bus all the way over there because I knew Timmy would be waiting for us at the downstairs window. Well then you did speak to him? - Yeah, we did. - I tried to call you, but you had already left. At least I didn't get any answer at your place. When you got there, what did he have to say? Dr. Redding told Timmy to go to his room and that he couldn't under any circumstances leave the house. It seemed sort of funny, so Timmy listened at the door and found out that tonight they are all going downstairs to the lab to find out once and for all if their information is for real. Dr. Redding said something about evidence of location, or something like that. Anyway, if the experiment goes okay, they will be leaving right away for the ... Pyramids? Pressure normal. Pulse steady with slight increase. Probably nothing more than the anticipation factor. Now remember, we won't let you go any deeper than you did last night. I understand. Miss Taylor, can you speak to us? Miss Taylor, do you hear me? Do you hear me? I can hear you. I can see as before. The ancient land. I see the mountains which surround a city of stone. Everything is of stone. |'am part of the past and of the city in which I place myself in obedience to the ceremony of devotion and to the offering of hope before the shrine. I see ... a great chieftain ... who approaches in elegant splendor and is frightening ... though his powerful form is surpassed by a known supreme wisdom. I am asked to never enter the pyramid, and yet I find myself unable to comply with my chieftain's request. I am compelled again and again to go into the pyramid as if some great secret was to be in revelation before my eyes. There, she is alright. (Ann crying) Good evening. This is Douglas Bank with all the news from across the nation. Dr. Edmond Redding who heads the staff at Cowan Research Foundation in Pasadena has departed for Yucatan for what he has described as an objective first hand search of the great pyramid there. Dr. Redding, a naturalist, has been successful in bringing to life some starling facts in the puzzles of man's early civilization. It isn't known at this reporting as to just what Dr. Redding is hopeful to find in the pyramid which is somewhat of a tourist attraction and has been searched, in its upper levels at least, many times previously. Accompanying Dr. Redding in the trip to Yucatan are members of the staff of the Cowan Research Foundation Dr. Redding's son, and Miss Ann Taylor of Los Angeles. If you are wondering where the pyramid is located, it lies at the western tip of the north Yucatan border. - Do you recognize it? - Yeah. - Do you recognize it? - Yeah. (Music) (Woman singing in ancient language) (Dancing) (Woman singing in ancient language) (Dancing) (Scream) Timmy! You shouldn't have left the car. Oh, he'll be alright. I'll stick close to him. As the memory of Ann Taylor had functioned to the degree of pointing to the areas unknown to her present generation the discovery of that, which had filled the minds of everyone, had become reality. The metal used by the ancient people was indeed gold of the highest quality. Somewhere, inside that pyramid lay a fortune as suspected. And the area itself was close at hand. A cold wave of something evil brought fear to the heart of Ann Taylor who for the first time felt herself wrong in searching the pyramid. Her protests were based upon intuitive feeling that in some way a dreadful force of dark evil will exert itself upon all those present for entering into the catacombs and chambers that were forbidden to all but the Mayans themselves. It was found that a mathematical system of distance separated each opening from the other and the approximate equation of squares would lead them from one chamber to a new one. Redding became more more intense in his quest to dive deeper into the mysterious catacombs that he now firmly felt not only existed, but would ultimately turn up more than their wildest expectations. Even during the heat of his excitement, Redding was at all times alert to the possibility of their being followed by someone at the levels above them and thought it best that one of the party take spot checks of both the outside and the areas covered to the present point. All right. (Mummy growls) (Mummy growls) (Scream) (Mummy growls) (Mummy growls/Screaming) As you may recall, we earlier in the week reported the details as we knew them of naturalist Edmond Redding's departure for Yucatan and of his quest for certain scientific data only yesterday morning, and has already touched off a sweeping fire of controversy in circles of anthropology and the scientific world in general. Our science editor, Dr. Frederick Munson has the story. From a telephone conversation I had with a colleague of mine, Dr. Eric Strollard of the Cowan Research Foundation, I learned of the incredible discoveries of the group who have now returned from Yucatan. The expedition, while proving to be one of the most startling in the history of anthropology due to what was uncovered in the pyramid was marred by the untimely death of Dr. Redding. An embalmed creature who's age has been estimated at something near two thousand years, at the minimum, had risen from somewhere in the darkness of the pyramid to crush the body of Dr. Redding. Other members of the expedition were able to subdue the creature through the aid of gases that were brought along to test mineral contents, but unfortunately, not in time to save the life of the expedition leader. The mummy, as it has been referred to up to this reporting has been tied securely with ropes and transported to Pasadena where it will be observed under laboratory conditions by members of the Cowan Research Foundation. Funeral services for Dr. Redding have been arranged for early next week. Hello, Dr. Janning ... Well hello Timmy. No, he is doing his broadcast. I was Just listening to it. I expect to hear from him shortly though. Uh, Timmy, I am working with your uncle now. It is alright to talk to me. He did tell you about it. Good. What? Why in heavens name should the police be interested? I see ... Well look, Timmy, I'm glad you called. Now don't get panicky about this thing. We'll figure something out. I'll tell him as soon as he comes in. Now you stay in touch. Right Timmy. Detective Hammond, police department. I'd like a word with the head of staff. I'm sorry, the doctors aren't talking to anyone. Uh, just a moment sir, - we have to talk to them. - I'm sorry, they are not talking to anyone. So, how did it go? Oh, alright. Weren't you listening? Yes, I heard the broadcast. I meant the hullabaloo. You must have been swamped with inquiries. Yes, from all of the wrong people. Is there any coffee going? I sure could use some. I've learned to work your kitchen. It is good and hot. I'll get it. You take a load off your feet. Thanks. It is really something out there. Complete chaos. Have you been able to find anything out from Cowan? No, hardly more than the news people. I was rather surprised that they even accepted my call. I understand that some of the reporters had a difficult time getting through this morning. Well, after they talked with me, I suppose they thought it best to release the story to everyone. That was around noon. Now they're not even answering the phone. Well, they are going to have to whether they like it or not. Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. I have an idea that they've ... they are trying to decide upon a temporary head. This reminds me. I have to call my attorney. I missed him three times already. If he can get things rolling along fast enough, I might be able to take charge before anything - is resolved by the staff. -You? Yes, certainly, Redding is dead, isn't he? Yes, hello. Uh, is this ... Yes. Uh, this is Dr, Munson. Is, uh, Mr. Brian in yet? Yes, yes I will. Yes ... Yes, uh, hello Jim. I've been trying to catch you since 9:00 this morning. I talked with your assistant around 10:00, but he couldn't tell me anything. Yes. Yes, well you know how difficult and how crucial the ... the time element is. I want to take over at Cowan right away before they move that mummy off somewhere. Yes. Yes, I know it is difficult. Well, if you are positive that is all that you can do, Well, I guess I'll have to accept it. Yes I will. Thanks. Well? Well it will take time to ... process the lab ... the papers, and we may have to go back to court. The minute they are served with papers that is the perfect tip-off for them to pack up the mummy and cart him off anywhere they like. I have to see him with my own eyes. Work with him. Do you realize that some type of life has been sustained in that creature for over two thousand years? Think of what it would mean if we could learn the processes that have caused such phenomena. I am thinking about it, also about the blunders that could be made over at Cowan. It is very possible that pressure from the police department can make them so nervous they might just give up. I've known Eric and the others for a long time the same as you, and I tell you there is no strength there. No competitive spirit. In what way do you contemplate the police getting involved? They are involved. I had a phone call from the boy a short time ago. The police? For what reason? Well, Timmy told me that Redding's family had been back and forth to the lab a dozen times asking questions about just how he was killed. It seems they don't believe that things happened just exactly the way Eric told everyone. It's obvious they've called in the police to investigate. Hmm, well I suppose they will be questioning everyone connected with Cowan. Well if they come here, use all of your diplomatic charm. I want them in and out of here as quickly as possible. This whole thing is getting to be more than I anticipated. Why can't things be done the right way, the easy way? Now, let's not get pessimistic. There is no need for it. No, no, of course not. Now the way I see it, the most important thing we can do is get our hands on that mummy. With him, we may be able to establish ourselves into the best position of all. The gold is something that will take care of itself. Now, what chance do you think we have to do that? A very good one. As a matter of fact, I think you are in for a few surprises. Pleasant ones. I'm afraid I don't ... know what you are talking about. Well, in the first place, I'd like to point out that in my mind, that mummy rightfully belongs to you. Now, you remember that old laboratory I used to have over on Clinton Street? -Yes. - Well, I went over there. And it's been vacant ever since I left it two years ago. Everything is still intact, including all of the equipment. It is a little dusty perhaps, but with some effort, it could be made to work as well as it ever did. You've ... you've opened it up? In secrecy, of course. Secrecy? I'm afraid I don't understand. You will Doctor, you will. Hello. This is Stesson, calling for Dr. Janning. He has a little job you can do for him. Yeah? Well, uh ... listen you ... you better tell him that, uh ... my price has gone up a little, uh ... Well, you know, the cost of living and all that. You'll be paid off good if you do everything right. Okay, that sounds good. Now who's the guy, and uh, when do you want it done? No. No, this is a little different. He wants you to steal a mummy from the Cowan Research Foundation. Bring it on over to the lab. Uh, I'm not sure I heard you right. Steal a what? You read the publicity in the papers. A mummy. it is in the very back building of the Cowan Research Foundation. Hello? Yeah, yeah, I ... I ... I got it. I think I heard you right the first time. We're having coffee at the Star Cafe, tenth street. Come on over and I'll give you more details. Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll be glad to cooperate. The police are most certainly entitled to any information that would help. - I've always felt that way. - Thank you. I feel it is the duty of every citizen. I'm glad to hear that Dr. Munson. I must say though that you are a rare breed. Having the door shut in one's face is more or less a policeman's hazard. Ha-ha. Well, I work independently here. It has its disadvantages, but also the advantage of not being tied down in anything of a political nature. - Mmm. - Or the obligation to a board of directors as is the case with Cowan Research. Oh, I could have gone to work for them a long time ago, but I'd rather have it this way and be my own boss. How familiar are you with the staff over at Cowan, Doctor? Well, I've known them all for 15 years, most intimately. And I may add that there has never been an incidence of foul play. During that period or any other time. Men of science, you know, are dedicated to their work. That above everything. I've heard. Doctor I'd like you to tell us everything you know about Dr. Redding. About his work. When did it begin? And incidentally, anyone you might know who would be interested in it. Well in answer to that I can only say that the work started, seriously that is, about seven or eight years ago. Great strides were made in the field by Stanton, Du Bois, and many others around the world. A great deal of evidence was brought forth to spurn many of us into our own deep interest in the field. Dr. Redding was one of the few who dropped everything else to plunge into regression on a full-time basis. He like the rest of us, at first found it difficult to find legitimate subjects, those who could really go deep. - People like Ann Taylor. - Exactly. Uh, which reminds me, there is a younger sister of six. Her name is Matty. I'll have to do something for that child. What is it that makes the difference in the individual? Why Ann Taylor? (Laughter) Now you are beginning to sound like a detective. No offense of course. But a short precise answer, I ... I cannot give you. We simply do not know. Doctor, I am very interested in what I asked you about other people connected with Dr. Redding's work. Well, I can only tell you that the ... the interest spread in every direction, every country. If you are attempting to pinpoint individuals, you have your work cut out for you. The number would run into the thousands. (Mummy growls) (Mummy growls) It makes a good headline. Could sell some papers. It draws a whole lot of interest. Yes, a story like this spread across the front page, it could increase our circulation, temporarily anyway, by 30, 40, maybe 50 thousand copies. But I wish you'd tell me something, Doctor, because I'd truly like to know. Just what is your game? I'm afraid I don't understand. Perhaps it is me you don't understand. Perhaps your understanding is based upon an editor's need for a story to sell morning editions, and that is the only important thing for him. Is that your understanding of me, Doctor? I don't know what you are driving at unless ... Unless I smell something rotten in Jamaica. If you think I have come to you with inaccurate facts, You are greatly mistaken! Everything is the truth! Just the way it happened! Well, it is a shame that these facts can't be backed up by anyone except you. The men at Cowan Research won't talk to anyone, and your Dr. Janning has left the country, and the most curious fact of all remains that every individual that actually saw this mummy of yours, is no longer alive. You know, it cost us almost two hundred dollars in makeup to see a proof like this. Harry? Kill the mummy story. Just carry a two column bit on the auto accident. Everyone killed. The driver, Ann Taylor, and, uh, one more, unidentified. Now, replace the headline with something on the mine disaster. Now get started. We've lost a lot of time. Well there you are, Doctor. Fact remains fact, and fantasy? Well that is something we don't write about. You know, a mistake is something we can correct in time, even though in some cases we are tempted not to. Now you've given up your broadcasting, so ho decision had to be made. That is quite convenient I'd say under these circumstances. I tell you, it's the truth. Every word of it. If it is, then I'll be the loser. I've been there before. You know, the two hundred dollars I mentioned to make up your headline? It is actually not so bad as all that. In saving face, we also gain a few dollars. You see, the lead is melted down So we can use it for type again. It seems like everything we use today had some sort of salvage value, even the waste paper is hammered into pulp and put through the presses again to come out with another story. Perhaps not a startling one, Doctor, but a reasonably documented story.
