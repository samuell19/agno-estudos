- This is such a cheesy idea If I get a hernia I'll make your life miserable - You already do - You're not planning of trimming this fucking thing tonight, are you ? - Stop with that word! Talk like that and I feel like a bad mother - You should have bought something bigger than that rag of a car Why we didn't get the standing delivery? - It would have cost us an extra 30 bucks We're only a few blocks away - I think if we're living in New York we'll probably get arrested I don't see why we need a damn tree anyway - It we'll put us in the holiday spirit - Oh yeah, like it did last year - Hey I had few bad downs - Crashed on the couch Don't remind me It was that lady mouse with the snow on the sparckling gree Give me a break - No, I really liked that ornament - I was new to this single shit - Uhh, language.... - You know I tought you were dead - You did ? - I don't remember, probably But, hey, at least we were still in New York - Come on, you like it out here - Yeah, you are right - What the hell are you stopping ? - To wait for the light. They do that out here - I still don't know what we are gonna do with the tree that nobody's gonna see - What about your friend? - What friends? Abby and Dustin - Well, Abby is in the south of Spain with his rich parents and Dustin, I don't know I mean, that kid is weird on some new meds probably wouldn't notice if the street is breaded with dicks - Hey - Sorry...Hello...! light change - What meds? - Zany depressants He had them changed saying they were killing his sex drive or whatever That should be the least of his worries - That sounds homophobic to me - What I meant was... I don't think he should be on meds cause his family cannot deal with who he is - Like you can deal with who I am ? - I try - Ah, the drama of the gifted child... - Are you talking about yourself? - What? No, no Just thinking about Dustin He has a thing for Sean Reynolds All the looser think that Sean is hot I mean, I don't He's just a lame, pretty boy so white, white, white - Is that you have superior taste ? - I do, all right! Listen up A couple of weeks ago Sean spit on Dustin - What ? - I'm ashamed to say I think he liked it - Too much information - It's my karma to be surrounded by masochists - Are you also referring to me ? - Oh...the hair shirt fits... Oh, speaking of shirts In gym class Dustin lifted Sean's T-shirt - Oh wait...too much information - You always want me to share I mean I'm just sharing that Dustin has a thing for the Sean animal - Speaking of things, do you have a thing for anybody? - Nope Pathetic right ? - No, not at your age - Come on, that's not true I mean if I was straight you wouldn't think that but you're just glad that there's no special boy in my life - I don't know how to talk to you about this stuff I'm sorry, I just don't - Wow now it's all about you - I wish you'd stayed in therapy and got beyond these catchphrases Come on - Maybe you should have gone with your father for the holidays - To the Hawaii ? - Yeah - Ten days trapped on the beach with dad and perky Marcy - Eh, I'd drown myself - We're lucky he let us move out here - They were relieved to get me out of the way - Well, I'm glad we're out here It's so much better! - A healthy positive change for both of us and I have a job I like and you you've made a couple of friends and, look around, my God, sunshine - It sounds like one of those pod people from that movie we watched - Invasion of the body snatchers - Yeah - Did you put a pot in my closet and am I gonna wake up straight tomorrow ? - No, just nicer - Oooh...ok You know, I made Marcy hyper and I have not even met most for her family, she censors who I meet, she calls me handsome All because she can't remember my real name When they call for Christmas and they ask what's new maybe I should tell them about my jock itch - That's gross You know how's gonna be like when Marcy hatches? Hey, can we put this down for a minute, my hands're hurting - Sure - Please, watch it! I don't want any broken branches - Oh, yeah that would be tragic - How do you feel about having a sister ? - A half-sister and I hope she turns out to be a dyke like a super butch one it runs in some family, right? - They have a name for the baby ? - Molly. Jealous ? - That was mean... - Sorry - What did you tell your father you want for Christmas ? - A hustler - That's not what you really want - Ah, ah, hey, you would jumpstart me, right ? - Can we get going ? - Aahh - I hope you'll like what I've got you - You're goody.. you always keep the receipts and if it's never anything we have to send back anyways Hey, bulletin from the spawn How about this year no presents for anybody, huh? - You have six days, six days till Christmas and I wanna get....wait for me... - How much I've to listen this old squaw? - You don't have to spend a lot - Hear me, all right? No gifts - I just need a little something - Yeah, you always do - What ? - He thinks - I'm more and more self... - Doesn't mommy get a goodnight kiss... you didn't say goodbye to me this morning... - All right, all right... - Love me...love me - I still don't know what we gonna do with this Christmas tree that nobody's gonna see - At night we will have the Christmas tree lights on - It will be cozy - It will be lonely - Hey come honey, you gotta help me I'm busy - Doing what ? - Okay I'm glad I had our ornament shipped It's gonna look nice [music] - Would you like a cup of tea - Why not ? [music] - Merry fucking Christmas - Right... Would you like like to open your gift ? - No, I don't think so - Sorry it's a stupid suggestion [phone ringing] - Don't get it - It might be Dustin's parents - No, they totally hate me, never gonna want to talk to me again I'm not here right ? - Hi ma yeah, merry Christmas to you We are fine Really ? Ah you just missed him yeah he went out with some friends No, no I'm not at all lonely It's a beautiful day here I'm not even gonna tell you what the temperature is cause you'd just be jealous... Ah, later Yeah, we're gonna have Christmas dinner at a friend of mine a nice woman from work Really ? I....Why? I...I will yeah I'll tell him you called I'll tell him you said hi okay, okay, love you, okay, bye They'd never abode your voice - And trying to think about something else - Like what ? - What a sweet kid he was - You were the only one who even thought so I don't think his parents even liked him I wonder if I did - Of course you did. He was your best buddy - He was my only buddy - I'd wished you didn't call last night I would have found out anyways - Not on Christmas eve - I was just checking in on him, right ? I should call Abby, shouldn't just text her - But in Spain? Wait - What's with you in this holiday ? - I don't know I just want to postpone all bad news, like forever Is there gonna be a funeral ? - Probably I mean the Larson's aren't gonna want me to be there - You don't know that - I know them [Telephone ringing] - It's your father - Don't answer it please [telephone ringing] - No, I think Dustin really wanted to mess up that bathroom I mean that's why he used a knife, could have just used pills there's nothing in that house to stop to start a pharmacy His sister she's on CN Axl that's her prescribed medication, the other ones are just a special treats and the mothers is on Valium and Paxil, the father's on Barbuturin and Xanax well and a lot buy Viagra to please his business associates - How do you know all of this ? - What? I mean, I have hands and eyes, they can look into a medicine cabinet - Did you ever take any of those pills ? - Only a couple of xanax - Don't start taking pills - Look it's not a big deal, all right ? And their bathroom was a cloud area pink, pink and more pink and the toilet paper it was pink with these little titty blue clouds all over Ah, I hated using it when I took a shit - I get the idea - I mean you know how much of a style queen Dustin was ? I bet that bathroom embarrassed him, that's why he used it for his final checkout he was giving this mother a good tick - Poor family - I'm not as evolved as you I could give a rat's ass about them - We can't begin to imagine the pain they're in - I hope Sean doesn't think that Dustin did it because of him - Oh Christ The guilt that kid would feel - Are you kidding ? He'd probably jack off to the thought of it - Did he do it because of this Sean boy ? - No way I mean Dustin was up for Sean in a kind of crushy, girly get away I don't think you would have done it if you actually love somebody anybody [music] - I hate these candle trees Dustin probably did the deed when we were trimming it - So we take it down ? - Nooo... too much work How do you know if you're a bad person ? - Why are you asking ? - Because I think I'm a sleazoid - Are you sweet - Only a self-centered prick would have had the dream I had last night - What was it ? It's too sexual I can't tell you - I didn't know you're having sexual dreams I mean I'm not a corpse like Dustin What kind of person has that type of dream after they just found out their friend off themselves - A very normal boy when trying to get back to life - Don't you think it's a little early to be getting back to life ? Here, how about you open your present ? - If you open yours - Not now Here - That you said you weren't doing presents this year ? - Yeah, I'm cooler than you know - Did you wrap this yourself ? - Noo..the lady in the store wrapped it - This is wonderful - The girl in the store said it was the best The book is new I told her about your Japanese movie fetish but I didn't tell her is that's all you watch after daddy dumped you - He didn't dump me - Denial... amazing... - It helps Tokyo Story is my favorite Hey let's watch it together sometime - Oh no no I look through the book, read about it, the movies's about old people they bum me out - Oh it's about so much more than that it's very... - Boring yeah I wonder what Dustin's parents are gone for Christmas but his gifts are still under the tree - Hey mom - Hi " Here's where you stand oh here's where you fall here's where you landed here's where you cry you can take my hand oh nothing it's hard take my hand don't let go take my hand we're almost home if you take my hand there'll be nothing to fear if you had taken my hand you would still be here heeeeee....
