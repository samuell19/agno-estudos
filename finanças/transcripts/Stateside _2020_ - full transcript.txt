Dr. Uzuki has said that he will be able to weaponize his recently discovered power grid To combat the alien invasion. And the Super Task Force Six has stopped yet another monster in Los Angeles. After saving Hong Kong from another alien threat, the Red Enforcers said they'd always be ready to protect the world. News is reaching us about the Enforcers. The government agency that runs the Super Task Force Six will be shutting down the program. We feel that there are no more threats from the stars and that the people's tax dollars would be better spent exploring the power grid as an energy source instead of just the super team. But how do we know there are no more threats? I'm sorry, that's all the time I have. Emperor Zagel, I bring news of Project Rapture. Could it go any slower? I'm getting antsy here. Quiet, Munkar. What is it, Azrael? It's almost complete. All that is left is the final installation of the six transformation units. Oh is that all, you idiot? It's only the most important part. Enough. 15 years we have waited. 15 years we have hidden ourselves away. We have manipulated the humans quietly for this to happen and soon I'll have enough power for the entire universe to be ours. Nothing they have will be able to stop you then. Nothing can stop us now. Come on, ADA, get in there. We're gonna need you if there's any chance. Come on, come on. Yes, this is the only one I could get out, but without all six their plan's dead. It's him, get him. Intruder? You're supposed to be in charge of security, you red-faced idiot. Stop whoever it is. We can't let anything happen when we're this close. Man, Paul, I got a bad feeling about today. Why's that, man? I don't know, I just, I can't shake this feeling that something bad's gonna happen. - Oh, come on, relax. Nothing's going to happen. Look who it is, Eugene. The writer and the nerd. Which one is which, huh, Hunk? Just leave us alone, guys. Yeah, we don't want any trouble. Ah, well we do. Yeah, we do. The most trouble. So much trouble. Lots of trouble. Trouble squared. Do you guys even live around here? Looks like someone's wet behind the ears. Are you guys in high school? Ha ha ha. Guys, I'm gonna call the cops. Yeah right, my daddy is the sheriff. The most we'll get is a good talking-to. Yeah, and a good talking-to is the most we're gonna get, and that's totally worth it to drive you guys crazy. See you later, losers. Better not catch you around here again. I live here. Yeah, we know. Come on, Eugene. Don't worry about those idiots, man. I mean, the only thing they make me do is change my shirt. It's just really annoying to have to deal with them every time. Well, maybe we should stand up to them. Oh, oh, yeah, sure and risk punching the son of the sheriff. No thanks. I mean, I know we could both take them, but I'd rather not risk a night in jail. I know. Look, man, I gotta change this shirt, and I got some writing to do anyway. All right. I'll see you later. Bye, Paul. Ah. This is a bad day. Writer's block? Geez, Amy, don't scare me like that. Aw, Jason, you'll do it. You'll write that big book and get rich. I don't wanna get rich, though. I just wanna write something that makes a difference. You know, something, just, I just wanna matter. Well you matter to me. You know what I mean. Just write something. It's hard. - Why don't you ask Paul? He's already been writing. Oh yeah, Paul. The guy who thinks an evil monster alien rules our government, yeah, I'll definitely go to him for advice. You could make a small difference. I heard there's a ballgame being played at the park. You don't care about sports. No, but I do care about those delicious fries smothered in processed cheese sauce that the snack shop sells when there's a game. Sure be nice to get some. Hmm, remember when I asked you about that? Yeah, when was that? An hour ago. Oh, Amy, Amy, relax, those games last forever. Well. Amy won't be too pleased with me. This is a bad day. You, you need. Whoa, buddy, are you okay? You need to take this. You look really hurt. Do you need to go to like the hospital or something or? Whoa, what did you do? The AI, its syncing up with your brain. It's teaching itself to you. You'll know how to use the armor as it comes to you. Oh, Tom, did you think you could get away? This is a bad day. You think taking one unit away from us would stop the project? It's barely a delay. We decommissioned the Super Task Force long ago. You're only a shadow, Tom. You manipulated everyone, but I never trusted what happened. I knew something was wrong. Wait, those guys? I remember them when I was a kid, but. And that's all that they are, a memory. Now all that we need to access the power grid is in your hands, child. What did you just sign me up for? You'll never get it. The sequence. Super Task Force, suit up! Oh geez. Man, did you see the size of that, oh? Here it comes. Can we talk about this? Ah! This should be fun. Fun isn't the word I'd pick. Ah, I always loved the fireworks I made from attacking your kind. This is a bad day. Just give it up. Hand over Unit Green, and perhaps I'll let you live. Look, you may be the big bad of the week for all I care, but as far as I could tell, handing this over to you would be a bigger, badder idea. Oh, good, I was hoping you'd keep this up. You wasted just enough time with that. Dirty fighter. So I figured out how to pull this gun out of nothingness. Let's see what it can do. No. Emerald, energy, blast! You. You're the... Look, buddy, we need to get you to a hospital or something. You're the last. They'll come for you. Who? Everyone. Hey. Hi! Where are the fries? Oh they were closed, I messed up, I messed up. I always mess up. You know me, I always mess up and get into bad situations! Why are you yelling? I'm not yelling! Why would I be yelling? Am I yelling? I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was yelling. I was having, I didn't know. I didn't know. Okay, how about you come sit down over here? We'll put the TV on and forget about it. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. All right, look, we'll just turn on the news. You'll forget about it, okay? - Yeah. - All right. Yeah, what is there to forget about even? Nothing bad happened at all while I was out there, right? Coming up after the break, an explosion in a local park, a man found dead, a charred crater and are the Super Force Six back? An eyewitness account says yes. I didn't really get a good look at him, but he turned into the Green Enforcer and then he blew up this giant monster. Oh my God, it was crazy. Exciting news, if that's the case. I'm sure that everyone will be keeping an eye out for the Green Enforcer when he shows up again. I'm Robert Allen. More on that when we come back. Jason? J-Babe, what's wrong, what happened? Why me? Why me? Oh geez, oh geez, oh geez, oh geez, I'm so screwed. I'm so screwed. Why did this happen to me? I'm just a writer. I'm not some. I'm a just a guy that writes. I write stupid stuff. I can't even write. I'm not even a writer, what am I? I'm not some fighter. I can't defend the world from who knows what? Monsters and aliens and stuff. Why is this happening to me? Okay, you're getting into scary territory now. What happened? Well, something may have happened to me today, and I may have something in my pocket right now. O-kay. What is it? Okay, but you can't tell anyone. What can it possibly be? It's the green transformation device. Some guy named Tom handed it to me and said I had to protect it, and them some big monster showed up and he killed Tom, and then he attacked me, and then I turned into the Green Enforcer, but I was still really scared because he beat me up really bad. I kind of accidentally won, but I don't think I could do that again, and I don't know what else is gonna be coming for me, and today is a bad day. Monsters hunting you notwithstanding, that's pretty cool. Can you transform for me? Not in here. Why not? The last time I did it, there was a huge explosion behind me. I like our house. Well what are you gonna do? I don't know, hide? Tom was pretty clear about hiding this thing. Why? You could help people. I don't know why. It's just a little thing. We know someone who might. Not Paul. He's still a massive fan of the Super Task Force Six, and he's an insane conspiracy theorist. So if anyone knows, it's him. Your royalness, Azrael has failed. What? Bring him to me. Oh yeah, about that. What? What possible excuse could be there for why he isn't begging me for forgiveness right now. He's kind of dead, kind of super dead. Oh, well that is a good excuse. Who destroyed him? The guy who stole Unit Green handed it to some kid. The kid transformed and well, got the upper hand. You're telling me that we're this close to completing Project Rapture and one of the devices is now missing? Being held by some unknown guy, yes. Need I remind you that we need all six for Rapture to work? We do still have Unit Gold. No, not even the good doctor ever used that device. It's too unstable. Who knows what would happen? We need to find Unit Green. Yes, my evil emperor, but how? We'll wait. It's only a matter of time before he uses the device again. Then we can find out who he is. Hey, bro, she bro, what's up? Oh, not much, how are you? I'm great. Have you seen the news? The Green Enforcer being seen? I think it's legit. And the government can't be too happy about this. Unit Green musta been stolen. And whoever has it is pretty screwed. Oh, oh, swell. Look, Paul, can we talk inside? Yeah, come on in. Come on. So I have some questions because something may have happened to me today. Yeah, you guys got questions, I got answers. So, I got this today from a dying man and then I fought a monster. Holy crap, dude. You? You're the Green Enforcer? I guess. Dude. Dude. Dude, oh, dude. How does this happen? How does this, where did you get that? How do you find that? Some guy named Tom gave it to me. Tom? Big buff dude. I suppose he was buff. Yeah, that's the former Red Enforcer. Oh. Wait, is he the one they found dead? Yeah, man, I'm so sorry. I know how much you love them. Paul, we need to know everything you know. You said the government isn't going to like this? Okay, so, flashback. The brilliant Dr. Uzuki discovers the power grid, which is a power source that fuels the Super Task Force Six's armors. And it can only be accessed by the Super Task Force Six, or Super Task Force One. Meaning you, buddy. Oh yeah, I'm clearly super pumped about that and not at all freaking out. So he worked for the government, and he created the team. He also founded the Enforcer Agency, and they kept the team running and designed the suits and each suit had a different attribute. They all made you strong and tough, but red was the strongest, and black would have the best armor, pink was the most agile and accurate, orange was the fastest and blue had the best tech. What does green have, the really stylish looks? Unit Green was an experiment, and one that worked. Being a jack of all trades and excelling in every field. All around was the most powerful but didn't surpass any other unit's best attribute. Wait, that sounds like the opposite of what you just said. No, so like green is stronger than everything but red, and it's tougher than everything but black. Gold star for the lady. Um, Paul? Shut up. There you go. Yay. Okay, so that's definitely why Tom grabbed green for you. It's the best hope for whatever's going on. So yeah, I remember them fighting monsters and stuff, but what happened? The government decommissioned them. Just shut them down and said that there weren't any more threats in the universe. Which is a stupid claim to make because how could they possibly know that? Well they were right. We haven't been attacked by any Lord Zarts or Queen Ritannas, or any of that made-up alien stuff. Isn't that convenient? Just after the team shut down, no one shows up and tries to enslave us. After years of fighting so many monsters, every evil thing in the entire universe just forgets about us? Or, did someone get in on the inside, one of the big bads? And just told everyone to stay away from Earth because it was his? You think that? Yeah, I think that. And honestly, a lotta the things that I'm saying points to that, but how can I know for sure without any details? How can I get specifics? Perhaps I can assist. Are we bugged? Is there a bug? We're all gonna go to jail, and they're gonna throw away the key, and we can't do that, I have plans for life. Um, who is that? My designation is ADA. I am the artificial intelligence that once assisted Dr. Uzuki and the Super Task Force Six. Where are you? Your transformation device. You're an AI? Affirmative. Wow, this is amazing. So like, you can think and stuff. That is certainly the definition of self-aware. Can we stop geeking out over the computer lady voice. We need answers. I have still been active within the Enforcer database. I know everything. Tell us, please. For five years, the Super Task Force Six defeated several major threats to the planet. Lord Duma, Queen Muriel, Razielle and his robotic army, and finally Emperor Zagel, ruler of all that was evil in the cosmos. He was the greatest challenge the enforcers faced. But their teamwork stopped everything he tried to do. Then they beat him? No, he disappeared. Nobody knew what happened to him, except Dr. Uzuki. Uzuki knew of his plans to brainwash the entire Enforcer Agency and decommission the team. Zagel eliminated Dr. Uzuki and used a quiet hypnotic device to take control of the agency. He destroyed the team but used politics instead of might. He has used the agency to create Project Rapture. Well, that sounds horrible. Rapture is a giant mechanized robot that will be powered directly by the power grid itself, making it completely unstoppable. But how? Only the transformation devices can do that. Exactly. The machine needs all six transformation devices to work. So since Jason has one of them? There's no way that it can work. Happy days. Unless they use Unit Gold, which is highly unlikely. Wait, what is Unit Gold? I am the biggest fan of Super Task Force Six, and I've never heard of Unit Gold. And nobody knows more than me. It's true, nobody does. I think maybe the AI in their own labs does. Unit Gold was an attempt to go even further with what Unit Green accomplished, to be the most powerful armor in every way, but its power output was so high it made the unit completely unstable. Zagel refuses to use it. It's more likely he will do everything in his power to get Unit Green back. Okay, so I'll just hide... forever. I thought you wanted to make a difference. Not when I could die. We gotta take the fight to Zagel. I don't know how you want me to fight the thing that the entire team together could barely fight, and still lost to, to be clear. It's just me, just little old me, just me by myself, just one guy who doesn't know how to fight, doesn't know how to do anything with any of the weapons or the big thing. I don't know, it's just me, it's just me, I don't know. I don't wanna die. I think you could do it. I have the code of what Zagel is using to keep the Enforcer Agency under his spell. It could be possible to develop a counter to it. My ability to write code was locked by Zagel years ago, if you'd look at the nearest terminal. I literally have no idea what I'm looking at. Well it's a tone, an audio file. So he's taking control of everyone through sound? Well yeah, anything more and somebody would notice it, but there it is, plain and simple. Ignore me, leave me alone, listen to me. ADA, where's he been broadcasting this? Across every media he could. I could write a counter tone, but we'd have to get it broadcasted. From this device, I can link with any terminal at anywhere. I could take whatever code you write and broadcast it myself. I can do that. We can do this, guys. I don't know. Jason, come on, man, you could help save the world. It's just, what if I don't do it? What if I can't do it, what if I fail? What if everything is worse because of me? But at least you'd have tried. And that's what made me fall in love with you in the first place. I mean, you've always been a bit weird and quirky, and you've had a little too much anxiety, but you've never stopped trying. But why me? I mean, why me? Paul, wouldn't you love to be the Green Enforcer? Do you trust me with that thing? Dude, I would literally use it to pick up girls and punch bears and stuff. I'm the definition of irresponsible. Syncing myself up with you took most of the unit's processing power. To start from scratch would be extremely counterproductive. Do it for me, Jay? Oh, fine. I guess I'll save the world or whatever. Great, I'll work on this. Okay, I will do what I need to do. Come on, you were doing so well. I can't do it! Monsters are scary! But you're a superhero. You didn't see what I had to fight. It had a rat face and a big sword, and it beat me up. And it hurt me. It was so scary. And I bet the other monsters are even scarier! Come on, I'm sure they're not that bad. Emperor Zagel is known across the stars as the beast, due to how many lives he has tortured and destroyed. He would make Jason feel pain unlike anything before. That sounds way scarier! - Listen to me. You are gonna have to man up and deal with this. You've never let me down before, and you've always risen to ever challenge you've ever faced. So, toughen up. And deal with this. Literally, the weight of the entire world is resting on your shoulders. Look, you have the chance to make the biggest difference. You can save everyone. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll do it. Just let me lay down here for a little bit. No no no no no, you're coming with me, big boy. What? No. Amy. Okay, you boys have a nice day. I'll work on this. Amy, help me! Are you serious? Heck yeah, I'm serious. I wanna see it. But what if they can track it? You'll be fine. You can beat up anybody that shows up, right? I'm not entirely sure of that, no. Come on, dude. You know I live for this stuff. I mean, please. Please. Fine. Yes, that's it. Yeah, yeah, okay. Just back off because this makes a huge explosion. Super Task Force, suit up! Oh man, that was so cool. That explosion was massive. Yeah, what is that anyway? Residual energy runoff. It's necessary to siphon it off to prevent an overload of the unit itself. Huh? Well hey, the more you know. This is amazing. Oh wait, just a sec. What are you doing? Taking my picture with the Green Enforcer. Pose. Oh ho ho ho. So what else you got? How strong are you? I don't know. What do you mean? Arm wrestle me. You can't be serious. I am, do it. Okay. And, go. Oh yeah. Oh, I got you. I got you. Oh, you're going down, Green Enforcer. You can use both hands if you want. Whoa, stronger than you, I suppose. Yeah, I'd kinda like to have an actual number. Oh, if only I was equipped with something that has literally the answer to anything. Someone, thank you very much. You're right, ADA, I'm sorry. How strong is this suit? Unit Green's maximum strength has been measured to benching 15 tons of weight. For comparison, Unit Red could do 20. And the rest of the team could bench 10. What else you got? Beautiful lovely ADA, would you be so kind? Dr. Uzuki also discovered how to access a pocket dimension. He used it to store not only all of the Enforcer weaponry but also their fighting robots. Wow, Dr. Uzuki was pretty smart. He was an amazing man. ADA, you miss him, don't you? Painfully so. I'm sorry. Thank you. Shoot it. Excuse me. Shoot the gun, I wanna see. That would cause a massive explosion. ADA, what kinda power output does this thing have? Depending on the charge and output power, your rifle can fire a concentrated blast of anywhere from one to 200 gigajoules of energy. Is that a lot? You could destroy skyscrapers. Just shoot a little one, just a tiny blast. I just, I wanna see an explosion. Fine, ADA, could you please crank this thing down to bare minimum? Already done. Oh, America! Oh, that was so cool. That was so cool. That was so cool. Oh, I love you, man. I love you. Oh ho ho, do you know who we should pay a visit to? Who? Eugene and Hunk. No. Why not? I'm not going to abuse this power by beating up a couple of guys just because we don't like them. Don't beat them up. Just scare them. No, that would be, that would irresponsible. I'm trying to be responsible. Right. You're right. What do you think we should do to those losers this time? I know, we should blow glitter in their faces. - Glitter? - Yeah, they won't be able to get it out for weeks. Dude, that's genius. Ha, get a load of this guy. Nice tights, are you some kinda cosplayer? Cosplayers are nerds. Yeah, we hate nerds. Hunk, what's wrong? Help me, you idiot. I regret this decision. Me too. Now, it's not very nice to be mean to people, is it? No, it's not. Are you gonna start being nice to everyone from now on? Yes, absolutely. Extremely nice. The nicest. Dude, that was hilarious. Yeah, that was pretty great. Oh man, what a power fantasy. Imagine what else we could do to them. - Whoa, whoa. Look, man, this isn't revenge. We were just trying to teach them a lesson so they aren't rude to everyone anymore. Sounds like getting this thing has changed you. Maybe. Let's go. My most dark master, I've tracked an explosion that could have come from the emerald rifle. Excellent. Where is it located? In the woods near town. Want me to go take care of him? No, it could be a waste of time. But, but it could be the guy. I could just sneak up on him and rip him apart before he changes. And if he's not there, then you'll have wasted an entire trip for nothing. Send the drones. Instruct them to destroy anyone they encounter. But the drones are even dumber than me. They have been groomed to destroy. I think they can handle a single Enforcer out of his armor. But what if he wears his armor? Please, the Enforcers never wore their armor when they fought my foot soldiers. Yeah, I kind of wonder why. Now do as I say. Tell them to comb the area and bring me back my transformation device. So, after you found Unit Green, you put on that shirt, right? No, why would I do that? Well, like, you're the Green Enforcer, so you wear a green shirt. I don't follow. So wait, you're telling me you just happened to be wearing that shirt today? Yeah, it's just a shirt. That's kinda weird. Why is that weird? Well, like, you're the Green Enforcer, and you're wearing a green shirt. You know, matching colors? Oh yeah, that is weird. I should probably change the shirt. You know, it's funny how such a little thing can change so much in one day. Yeah, the world's a crazy place, man. You know, I was actually trying to write a superhero story before I got this. Oh yeah? No way. Yeah. I couldn't, I had writer's block, I couldn't figure out how to get the guy his powers. I wanted to do something that wasn't generic, that hadn't been done a buncha times before. Right. And, today I get this just by chance, you know, just randomly. So yeah, I wanted to ask you. Can I see that? Okay, just be really careful. Oh, thanks, dude. Oh wow, dude, this is so cool. I mean, I've been obsessed with the team since I was a kid, and now I'm holding an actual units device. It's lighter than I thought it would be. Don't do that. Come on, it's not like I'm gonna break it. He is correct. It would take a massive impact to damage this device at all. See? I can throw this all around. Oh, it's still okay. Oh no! Oh no, hey, it's fine. Come on, man, don't mess around. Fine, here, take it. Why would you do that? I thought you were gonna catch it, sorry. You threw it like a baseball. - I'm two feet away from you. - Well get better reflexes. Go get it. - Why me? - Because you're the one that threw it with all of your might. Oh, geez, fine. Oh, hey, guys. Are you guys? Yeah, you hold on right there. All right, Paul, wonderful. Jason, what's going on? Do you have it? Have what? What do you mean what? Oh, right, this. Throw it. Oh sure, now you catch it. Super Task Force, suit up! All systems ready. Ada, what are they? Zagel took the people he killed and turned them into mindless androids. Can Unit Green handle all three of them? Unit Green exceeds their power output over 50 times. ♪ Super Task Force One ♪ ♪ Evil comes undone ♪ ♪ Super Task Force One ♪ ♪ We can get it done ♪ ♪ Super Task Force One ♪ Dude, that was awesome. I think I wet my pants. Well I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, buddy. Go ahead, get outta here. Go home, Amy might need help. What about you? I just kinda need some time alone right now. All right. Sire, based on the drone's readings, it seems they have been destroyed. How could that be? They communicated that the guy turned into the Green Enforcer. What? The old team never transformed against my drones. Who does this new Green Enforcer think he is? Smarter than the old team? But not as smart as you, your evilness. Surely he won't be able to get away from you much longer. You're right. He'll slip up, and when he does, I will crush him. Then, I will take the whole universe. ADA, am I doing the right thing? What do you mean? Taking the fight to Zagel. I calculate that there is only a 32% chance of being able to defeat the emperor on your own. Well that makes me feel great. Going to have another panic attack, Jason? No, no, I'm pretty numb to it now. It's almost like I just have no choice. If it makes you feel better, there would only be a five percent chance of being able to hide Unit Green from the emperor forever. So this would be the best course of action. Well, that does help a bit. ADA, what was the last Green Enforcer like? He was very brave. He always fought for what was right. He never backed down. He risked his life countless times to save the world and his team. He was strong and naturally rose to the role of a leader. Too bad he isn't here right now. You have more in common with him than you think. You really wouldn't have picked someone else? Statistically speaking, there are millions more qualified than you on a technical level. I think that's a bit of an understatement. But even I can recognize the quality of one's heart and soul. You're strong where it counts, and you are a funny man. What's that? I tapped into your phone to access any communications. Amy is trying to contact you. Answer it. Jason, I did it. The code? Yeah, actually it was pretty easy. All I had to do was reverse it and then pace it properly. If we can get it broadcasted, it'll undo everything that Zagel did. That's great, Amy. The only question is, how do we get it broadcast? If we break into the Enforcers Agency, we can hack into the main database and override the code. That sounds like a good plan. That also sounds stupid and dangerous. I'm supposed to be a good guy. I'm not gonna be up a bunch of soldiers and scientists, regardless of whether they've brainwashed or not. Well what else can you do? I mean, we're talking any kind of broadcast, right? Correct. Jay, what are you thinking? I'm gonna make a couple of calls. There must be a way to smoke this rodent out of his hole. Master. If I knew his identity, I could assault him head on. Destroy his friends, his family. I need that device. My lord. Quiet. Maybe I can simply assault the town, or send a new creature to rip the town apart until he shows up. We could focus on sending drones into every public place in hopes of making him transform and follow him. Emperor? What is so important? I'm trying to hatch a scheme to find out who is the Green Enforcer. Um, we could watch the news. He's on it. Bring me my evil screen. And now I'm here with the new Green Enforcer, Jason Oliver, I can't believe you contacted us. Thanks for coming on. Good to be here. So for the audiences at home, Jason has already proven who he says he is, shown us the armor and everything. You can't show us now, can you? Well, there's always a massive explosion behind me whenever I transform, and I don't wanna mess up your wonderful set. So I notice that you're wearing all green. You don't think that it's old-fashioned to be color coordinating your clothes like that? This was actually an accident. I just haven't had a chance to change yet. No, it looks good on you. How does it feel to have superpowers? Well, I mean, it's pretty great, I guess. I mean, it's kinda scary when it first happens. Where does the suit and its weapons come from? Are they inside the device? I think it's a pocket dimension. Now that you mention it, why go to us? Why come public? I just feel the public deserves to know. And they definitely want to know about you. If I can answer just one question, please let this be the question I can fully answer. Okay? Sorry. I wanted to show people that they weren't alone. I wanted to show people that there's hope. I wanted to show them that they don't have to be afraid. Afraid of what, though? There haven't been any major threats or crises in the last 15 years. Afraid of the truth. Oh my. Emperor Zagel, he's been in charge of the Enforcer Agency. He's been running things for years. How did I not know that? He's been hypnotizing the entire world to ignore him for the past 15 years. ADA here just broadcasted a little tone across the entire planet which deprogrammed everything that he did. You hear that, Zagel? Everyone knows. Everyone knows that you're there. And guess what? I'm here to stop you. Oh yes, now the world knows who its true ruler is. Me. I own you all. Now you know. Now the world's governments will stop helping me. It's too late. Project Rapture is complete, and you, Jason, I will be coming for you. What do you we do? Who do we call? I need to go. Thank you for having me. Monkar? Yes, my devious dictator? Get me Unit Gold. But, sir. No arguing. If we can't get Unit Green, Rapture still must go online. Well that was super smart. What? It worked. And now the whole world knows that Jason Oliver is the Green Enforcer. It's not too hard to figure out that we're dating. Can I please go to the grocery store without getting attacked by monsters? Come on, Amy. No, don't you come on, Amy, me. It's not like I have super cool armor that makes me invincible or lets me bench tanks or anything. I can protect you. No, you can't follow me all the time, and I wouldn't want you to. No, think, Jason. You didn't talk me out of it before I actually did it. That was before I saw that superbad alien on TV saying he was coming after you. I don't even wanna go home now. What if he's there? What if the house is blown up? What are we gonna do? Can you guys not fight in my house please? Shut up, Paul. Oh ho, okay, sure. Of all the things you could have done. I did what I had to do. I had to go out there and let people know that I was there for them. I had to let everyone know that they weren't alone. I'm sorry for putting you at risk, for putting you both at risk, but I couldn't just stand by and do nothing. Do you really mean that? Yeah, I guess I do. Looks like you're finally starting to make a difference. Yeah, I guess. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous. But you did good. He did well. Shut up, Paul. Okay then. What are you gonna do now? I'm gonna try to do the unexpected. I'm gonna call the emperor out so that he loses even more troops. What? That's suicide. Look, I can't beat Rapture, according to what ADA's saying. Tell her, ADA. Rapture's power output would surpass anything in the known universe. Do you hear that? I have to keep the pressure on him now before Rapture gets up and running. I think I'm getting the suit thing down pretty okay. I don't want you to do this. Don't do it. Do it. It sounds awesome. Shut up, Paul, you're not helping. Amy, he's the Green Enforcer. He's the only one that can do it. He's right. Look, what I need right now is a worried girlfriend, just being concerned about me. Maybe next time you can come out with me. Next time. What color do you want? She can be pink, because she's a girl. No, that's sexist. Why don't you be pink? And I would look fabulous. Okay, well, time to take a huge gamble and hope I don't die. Get them, buddy. Super Task Force, suit up! Calculations confirmed. The emperor would read your location if you fire your weapon at at least 20% power. ADA, I'm gonna need all your help on this one. I am happy to be of service. Emerald, energy, blast! There, there he is. The fool is asking for it. What do we do? I still need to prepare. You will go and battle him. But, but, but, but, he's strong. This guy knows what he's doing. What if he defeats me? Then I'll make you grow to become a giant. If I may ask, my master, why not just do that now? I could crush him where he stands, and he wouldn't expect it. Don't be a fool. You know full well why I always had to wait for my servants to be defeated on foot before they could become giants. And why is that? Why are you still standing here? Yes, my master. Ah, the Green Enforcer, it's good to finally meet you. And, who are you? I am Monkar, second in command of Emperor Zagel. So, you're that red-faced guy's boss? Well, I'm recently promoted. Thanks for that. Azrael always was kind of a jerk to me. Better benefits? Now I get a dental plan. Well, good for you, I guess. I'm here to destroy you, you have no chance against... What, what? What are you doing? Shooting you. But we haven't even fought at all. Yeah, I really don't think I need to wait to use my super powerful weapon to end this fight. I can just start off with it, skip the whole in between. Ha, I'm too fast. You'll never catch me. Can't get away from this one. Don't do it, please. I never liked working for Zagel. I'll leave you alone, I swear. I'll tell you whatever you want to know. And how can I trust you? Because now I'm gonna destroy him myself. Thank you, thank you, let me know who wins. Idiotic coward. Nice to meet you face to face, Emperor. Ah yes, Jason, is it? I take pride in being able to destroy you with my own hands. Destroy? You actually say destroy? Oh, how kid friendly. Oh, killing you is not enough. Destroying you means wiping everything you love out of existence. Ha, pitiful. How strong is this guy? His strength is... Rhetorical question. It took all six Enforcers to provide me a challenge. But you, even in Unit Green you can't stand up to me alone. I wonder, how long until your hand breaks? In two minutes, the armor covering your hand will give out. Can you reroute the power to the strength of a single punch? Yes, but if you aren't fast enough, Zagel might... Just do it! Defense and life support are down, but your right arm can now punch at three times its normal strength. Okay, ADA, balance everything so that I don't die. Already done. I'm impressed. Can you do that again? I don't know. Do you have any more crazy evil speeches prepared? Oh, how good this feels. This is a bad day. Defense power is down 60%. At this rate, the armor will shut down automatically in five minutes. I think I need to bring a gun to this fistfight. I don't believe that is the correct phrase. It's just a joke. Ha. Emerald, energy, blast. I had forgotten how strong that gun is. Yeah, I'm not really much of a gun person, but I really like this thing. Yet you see how I survive. It looks like you're really hurt, though. Musta taken a lotta outta you to do that. Could you do that again? Can you handle firing again? All I have to do is squeeze the trigger. This thing has its own power source. ADA, how many more shots do I have at full power? Eight. I have eight more tries. Then perhaps it's time to end this. What? No way. How do you like it, Jason, seeing the physical embodiment of your doom? Why didn't he just get in that to begin with? I decided to use Unit Gold after all, but all systems are up and running just fine. It's time to blast the world into submission. I will rise above it all. ADA, can my gun even dent that thing? No. Wait, didn't you say I have my own giant robot? Yes, you have Omnimech Green. But its power cannot match Rapture. Gotta try. I need Omnimech power, now! Nice stereo. Come on, Jay. We haven't seen that thing in years. Is it strong? It's definitely the best stand-alone Omnimech on the team. What about against that thing? At least we get to see two giant robots fighting, right? Stop it. Worthless. You think that out-of-date machine can touch me? Oh, I'll do more than touch you, even if it's the last thing I do. ADA, do I know how to pilot this thing? Yes, all data was uploaded already. Good, otherwise I would look really stupid. Last stab, last stand for humanity. Oh, do you hear that? It's the hope of humanity dying. You have nothing left. Give up, and maybe I'll let you live. No, I'll never give up. We don't have to give up hope. We'll always have hope. We'll stand up against you and fight back. We will never stop resisting. Ever. Just yesterday, you were nothing. You didn't matter. Who do you think you are? I'm Jason Oliver, the Green Enforcer. Emerald big bang. Jason, as is, there is no chance you can defeat Rapture. I know. Should I call Amy? Nothing I can say she doesn't already know. I really must thank you, Jason. It's been so much fun to fight against one of my archenemies again. But here is where we say goodbye. I call this weapon the Soul End. What's happening? If I had to guess, it seems that Unit Gold is malfunctioning. Reroute all power to the big bang. Jason, if that fails, there will be nothing that can save your life. It's our only shot. No, no, I was so close. Yeah, but it's okay to get the silver. You think this'll make you safe? You think I'm the only threat in the universe, the only one on this planet? No, but you're the only one with a giant robot that can destroy everything right now. Emerald, big bang. Jason. Whoa! A lot has changed in the past two days. You can say that again. A lot has changed in the past two days. I will punch you. Ah, tender, tender, tender. So I heard Eugene tried telling his dad about what you did. Yeah. Tried to press charges and everything. That is until the president herself called the station and just told them to drop it. You're gonna meet the president later? Yeah, yeah, if I feel like it. I'm tired. What did they say about the suit? Well, they're letting me keep Unit Green. I guess people like me, so taking it away would be political suicide. Whatever. Who cares about politics? What about the Enforcer Agency? Well, they're paying me now, so that's cool. I'm just gonna keep on fighting the good fight. Hey, what about the other units? ADA? The other six units are still not yet recovered. Were they destroyed? Negative, that explosion could not have damaged the devices. More likely they've been spread by the force of the blast. Whatever, they're tiny. I'm not gonna hunt all over the city for them. They'll turn up. They did need some help, though, at the agency. They needed someone to help do the programming. They needed someone to monitor all the situations. Are you about to say what I hope you're about to say? You're both members of the Enforcer Agency now. Paul, you are technically a member of the Super Task Force. I hope he's okay. So, Jay, you're gonna continue to make a difference? So long as I make a difference in your life, that's all that matters. Oh, that's so cheesy. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Today is a good day. But seriously, ow. The emperor is dead. Now everyone will be vying for the crown. Between each other and the Green Enforcer, nothing will happen without a fight.

I wasn't even sure if that was going to work. Whoa. You must be the one that defeated the emperor. I am Dr. Uzuki.
