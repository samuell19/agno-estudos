BRR, SURE IS COLD UP HERE. I DON'T RELISH FLYIN' AT CHRISTMASTIME, BUT A NEW CABBAGE PATCH KID IS GONNA BE BORN SOON AND I'VE GOT TO GET DOWN THERE. IT'S HIDDEN IN A SECRET SPOT DOWN THERE IN NORTH GEORGIA. COME ON! THERE ARE THE BUNNY BEES SPREADIN' THEIR CRYSTALS. AND THERE'S THE KIDS. HI, HELLO! HELLO, KIDS. THE YOUNG BOY'S XAVIER ROBERTS. HE HAPPENED ON THE CABBAGE PATCH ONE DAY BY ACCIDENT. AND HIM AND ME ARE THE KIDS' ONLY FRIENDS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. WOW. HELLO, BABY DOT. TOMORROW'S CALLED CHRISTMAS. IT'S A GREAT HOLIDAY XAVIER'S BEEN TELLING US ABOUT. YOU DECORATE A TREE AND HANG STOCKINGS ON A TURKEY. YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG, CANNON LEE. YOU HANG THE LIGHTS ON THE TURKEY. COME ON, COLONEL CASEY. XAVIER'S SHOWIN' US PICTURES OF CHRISTMAS, AND WE'RE TOASTING MARSHMALLOWS. THIS IS WHAT A CITY LOOKS LIKE ALL DECORATED FOR CHRISTMAS. THAT YOUNG FELLA THERE IS OTIS LEE. THAT'S SYBIL SADIE, TYLER BO, RACHEL MARIE, OR RAMIE FOR SHORT, DAWSON GLENN, COUSIN CANNON LEE, AND PAULA LOUISE. AT LAST COUNT, SHE HAD 2,751 FRECKLES. HEE-HEE-HEE. OH, AND 3,000 MARSHMALLOWS.

HA-HA-HA! THE SPIRIT ISN'T A MAN. XAVIER SAID THE PEOPLE GO TO THE CITY TO SEE THE SPIRIT IN THE AIR. IT'S A GREAT BIG SPOOKY-LIKE THING THAT FLOATS AROUND IN THE SKY. WHATEVER IT IS, LET'S GO TO THE CITY AND SEE IT. YEAH, ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE CITY BEFORE, KIDS. BE CAREFUL. I'LL LOOK AFTER THEM, COLONEL CASEY. THE KIDS LEFT BABY DOT IN MY CARE, AND CRAWLED THROUGH THE KUDZU VINE AND OUT THE SECRET PASSAGE. THE KIDS ALWAYS HAD TO BE MIGHTY CAREFUL WHEN THEY LEFT THE PATCH. THERE WAS DANGER LURKIN' OUTSIDE. THE EVIL LAVENDER MACDADE AND THE RUTHLESS CABBAGE JACK AND BEAU WEASEL WERE ALWAYS TRYIN' TO CAPTURE THE KIDS TO WORK IN THEIR MINE. WE CAN'T REACH THE GOLD, LAVENDER. FOOLS! I KNOW THERE'S GOLD IN THERE. I'VE GOT TO GET MY HANDS ON THOSE BRATS. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES SMALL ENOUGH TO CRAWL INSIDE. COME ON! WE'LL GET 'EM THIS TIME. YEAH. I THINK THE CITY IS THAT WAY. I'M IN CHARGE, DAWSON GLENN. I THINK WE GO THAT WAY. I'M SECOND IN CHARGE AND I THINK WE GO THAT WAY. WELL, I'M IN CHARGE OF WHO'S IN CHARGE AND I SAY WE GO THAT WAY. YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. WHERE'D THOSE BRATS GO? HOW WE GONNA GET TO THE CITY NOW? SOMEONE'S COMING! THIS 'UN WILL BRING A GOOD PRICE IN THE CITY. HANG ON, WE'RE GOING TO THE CITY BY TREE. THERE THEY ARE! AH! WOW!

WHERE CAN WE FIND THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT? BEAT IT, BRATS! THAT LADY LOOKS LIKE LAVENDER. AND THE MEN LOOK LIKE BEAU WEASEL AND CABBAGE JACK. WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT CAN'T BE ONE OF THEM. THERE'S THE SANTA CLAUS XAVIER TOLD US ABOUT! I BET HE KNOWS WHERE THE SPIRIT IS. RIGHT. COME ON! FRANK! THOSE CHILDREN!
