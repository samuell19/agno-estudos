The fuck this shit even mean? NTV means "Native." "Off The Boat" is underage. The umbrella means no condoms, and HH is for half hour. Tell 'em how it works. I find girls and bring 'em to the motel. If there's native girls, we set 'em up with this guy, Bobby. I think he posted this. And Lisa is bringing a new batch of girls over tomorrow. Bobby's supposed to show up. We can plug you in with this batch. Listen, Kaylee. If you want to go through with this, you have to be all in and play the part. And once you're there, you're on your own. Just tell me where to be and I'll be there. Go! Good. Break the... break the... break the grip, break the grip. Get your hips out. Break it. Break the grip. Good. Good. All right, shoe. Good sprawl.

Get up, K.O.! You need a ride back? No. I'll take the bus. What? You got somethin' to say, say it. I mean, look, it's been, like, two years. Two fuckin' years, K.O. That could have been anybody in that ad, man, we just goin'. I love her like a sister, too, but... I mean, I don't... I don't think it's her. I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm just trying to keep it a buck, man. But I know you already got your mind made up. What? You're worried about me. You love me that much. Can't picture life without me. Fuck outta here. Thank you, Brick. You ain't gotta thank me. Yo, for real, though. - Be safe out there. - All right. She's flappin'. Like a trout. Flailing her arms. I'm lookin' around for a branch or somethin'. But there ain't nothin' around. I'm just screamin' at her. But she doesn't get any closer. She's been swimmin' in that river for 12 years. I tell myself she's dead. But she keeps swimming on back to me. I used to hate those dreams. But now I look forward to them. To remind me she's still out there swimming. Ain't nothin' I can do but wait. Thank you, Awan. I know how difficult it is to talk about, but... that's why we're here, right? Be there for each other. Who else wants to check in? Coleman? I'm angry. Okay. What are you angry about? No closure. No help. It was my responsibility to keep her safe, and I failed to do so. If your daughter was here right now, what would you say to her? Oh, I'd take her in my arms... Fuck this. I'm sorry. Listen, um... Why don't we call it a wrap for today and we'll meet back here same time next week? Yeah? Thank you, everyone. You want coffee? No, I'm good. Thanks. Sit. Are you fighting again? Yeah. Any fights comin' up? Yeah. I'm gonna be gone for a little while, so... I just wanted to stop by. So, how's Megan? What? We broke up two years ago, Ma. You know that. Forgot. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah? Look, I told you the last time I saw you, I'm not giving you any money until I know you're clean. I didn't come here for money, Ma. That was the last pow wow we went to together. Some days I keep it on the desk, some days I put it in the drawer. I just fuckin' wish you would say it. Say what? Just say you wish it was me. Put the picture back, Kaylee. Not a day goes by where I don't think about this little girl. I'm not gonna do this with you, Kaylee, I'm not gonna play this little game with you. I'm not leavin' here... - until you say it. - I'm not gonna say it! You wish it was me on that wall, missin'. And not your precious Weeta. You're over here praising and grievin' everybody else's loved ones, you got one sittin' right in front of you, you won't even fuckin' acknowledge me. Goodbye, Ma. On Saturday... On this Saturday, this weekend, my sister's got a big fight goin' on, so you are gonna be there. And who's gonna be there ringside? I'm gonna be supporting her on the side. Yep. Yep. And you know I can't be there and can't win without my baby sis. You think I'm gonna win? - Yeah, of course you are. - You better say yes. Where again? When? Tell the people. - Tell the people. - Saturday, this weekend. - Yes. - Be there. Or else I'm gonna send her after you. - I will. I will. - She's the rough one. Weeta. Come here. I gotta spar a few rounds. Just a little bit longer. I thought you said we were leaving soon. A little while longer. We'll get some food afterward. That's okay.

It's a cluster of islands off the west coast of Africa. That's a pretty cool mix. Your mom from there? Dad? - Dad. - That's cool. Oh! I'm clean. Well, good for you. Give me your arm. I'm not askin'.

Yeah. Yep. Almost there. I got a special spot I like. It's coming. Okay? Okay. You want to get high? No, I'm good. Thank you. You mind if I do? - No, do your thing. - Thank you. What's that? On your eye? Someone rough with you? Yeah. Sorry to hear that. I love this song. Get up, K.O.! Come on. It's okay. It's just water. Okay? Did you really think you could trust a pimp and her whores? Corrupt ex-cop turned P.I.? You're smarter than that. She's gone. You're never gonna see her again. Nobody's looking because nobody cares. You can speak. Fuck you. It's okay. What's your mother's name? It's Jaya, right? Be back in a couple of hours. Fuck. - Hey, Dad. - Where is he? In the basement. Find the girl first. Then come back and take care of this. All right, she's been on foot for about an hour or so. She can't have got too far, okay? You head towards the river, and you head toward the interstate, and then loop back around. You fucked this up! Kid, get up! Get up! I'm always cleaning up your shit! Now, get the fuck outta here! Go! Go! Fuck! Oh! I'm not hungry. Give it to Junior. Thanks, Mom. Thought you weren't working overnight.

You're gonna give me answers. And if you don't... I'm gonna hurt your son. Have you seen this girl before? - No. - Don't fuckin' lie to me, really look. I haven't seen her before. Who's this? His father, Willie. What does he do? He's a businessman. He owns a bunch of land along the lake. You know what this piece of shit does, right? If I were you, I'd walk away. He do that to you? What do you think? Yo, man, what the fuck? I've been tryin' to hit you up all day. Next batch is ready to go out. 4:30 at The Yards. Hit me back, man. Later. What's The Yards?
