in I'll ok ok it has to be back to the beginning that was a yes yes work one seems to know before we stores we did you meet then 1963 you're talking about did you make we didn't we didn't need it using we were in New Jersey wit we didn't even know existed you know we exist we had no idea who he was Stephen Hawking you see the musical you believe it size there was no beginning of the universe past present future the universe has always existed handed always welcome the it stays missing it is what is it wait how long we got here I don't be late on a pansy is was late for his Nobel Prize I don't think so we filming now yes I swear to you that this is the most profound thing you will hear in your entire life the sound although story the sound or the story what's the difference day of Muthusamy to find a new matter she's being created to replace old matter this process has always existed and will continue for nothing changes nothing as ever change my peers not given it a name have called it steady stay night consumer mood that's cool works for you Lee I'm K-mart we haven't had I'm from Stevens only message to the party and he invited me to this post care 01 fine good you and still find thanks %um your own thanks thank you very much there terrible fate number use through a next Stephen its heights people want to dance testified ski mask good happy birthday to go outside good for it makes me feel small very small all that out there us here every and there was wrong said albans is apt to be the center of the universe specific died 321 years ago today on your birthday change really thought about everything be frightened change my father nice to come out in the middle of the night look at stars Aki source don't die once caused a shit about 200,000 years ago Houston reached into a visit to 1956 if likes fast but it is cost sorry 26 they're all so far away but they don't seem to mean is the like my chechen reaching you might just touched them but hurry up with your stretching and reaching because I getting further away wat galaxies moving away from us concerns about six million miles and disappointed 200 million miles I believe in God site just want to say I didn't know I right Citi Field small this got me feel that small stuffing wrong with feeling in science field masses all the best ideas I've felt then argued about later einstein said he could feel his little finger fun ideas right to good company and you like phone actually net I don't think he's what compass and vertiginous who do you like them rachmaninoff wat nothing brahms Stephen I didn't say anything the Beatles there nevermind King yes Kings Kings be want love me too we should go in pocket come on cut very funny a okay the help her change hear me what's wrong with you I could help well give me a hand with us truth yes Milford mall thats no all still both you each is mine me aluminum I you all these Stephen I'm 21 for you I'm older than you how much older and 33 images that Monroe in some like it hot in which he did I'll know when I guess and insurance salesman old Bank Leumi Anna I'm a cosmologist who could feel you just as my PhD orthostatic a PhD I P hands to take about five minutes sometimes it helps to to talk about something completely different in mindfulness and then the time suspended in space pass more quickly space not exist independently of each to soon with this me better and a genius cool stalks placed stunts curved lived no new we don't know those tests he sees by who was is confuse of the x-ray ok just fine with the dice shows that you don't have anything persons court much good reason it's a process so elimination unity I mean you're both getting the Nobel Prize this evening I put them up for the job and they wouldn't let me in on the interview so I loitered around when bob Bennett few committee came out doing their handshakes and thank you for coming let you know I moved at gave job right you gave Bob the job Kenya it was kind of embarrassed pause so I told him straight bob and I can walk down the corridor right here and bright out that door right there and if you don't want bob has a job that he was born to do you call before we go through that door on this walk my life 62 paces we never look back ima tell me what you're thinking doctors don't it didn't themselves I'm a doctor Isabel I know what their life your tropical disease expert that I know doctors force is about nothing arrange for you to have a private room no percent would like everyone else of them start the mold the the word p pools here films do you want me I was thinking of Westfield two ladies college it on the dash in volume I suppose and its clean Scrabble E let's play Scrabble the the kill me a his 12th like it was beautiful I came out in the woods and there it was a perfect peace if equipped the antenna a great big more like a gramophone morn lying on its side the size of a house in the middle of the field on a hill 20 miles at New York City picking up the hiss pointing at the stars and picking up to his and the first time I saw that point you know what playful right out over who the pigeons a 24-21 had a couple pitches living inside pigeons pitches what was it for the twenty-fifth home apart from pigeon nesting we wanted to mention noise from the outer edges Milky Way are to build a cholo what's that 5 Imperial gallons of liquid helium you know how much you mean that is it's a helluva quantity helium his %um unbelievably accurate reference against which you can measure the noise you see I know is very precise he makes these things better than anyone maybe it's a germany your German for six years my life in a big chunk of my temper Bob made a great switch to connect the receiver alternately to the antenna and the cold load reference were you born in Germany when the nineteen forties not 1930s noises he the higher the heat the more intense the noise you may want to ask did we get noise we got a lot of noise which means a lot of heat far more than the Milky Way should have given its that was our work from then on day after day what's all this heat what the hell is this case died in the night what's usually I would sit down with the patient spam please motor neurone disease his much in your arms in the brain which signal movement sign the brain stops and must the single months the muscles among use so they waste away so Houston wastage courses immobility how slowly gradual arrests and and then what researching muscles unlike missed on the muscles work horse mask breathing yes they don't waste away sick but but they do they do least way yes this what community three degrees partly met with the principles in like like training what about the brain and the brain itself on tough friends left good good of theme the movie the new the mom who of well easy on to work in his favor min remember when he was about eight-years-old and we're in the garden with Tesco has to use it to me which stars come from to know the answer and you called into bed and he wanted to know the answer to his question very badly I said not to worry I find out for him and if it did you've never been a sentimental thank net it think we can food for you to stop looks it up the younger you are when you get night in urine disease the quick a the deterioration being young is a it's a bad thing is about mom two years probably name in Lima support him yes you do it by carrying on you do it by living carrying on he's going back to Cambridge his life you know while says for you could drive a car straight upwards you reach space enough for now I want to drive around the Milky Way you multiply the diameter of the galaxy by the distance 190 a easy the calculation pick up she's been to india and back remember what does it take to complete a PhD depends on the subject for the fair when fair when did a good bring two years what's the name your supervisor Shama Dennis Shasha five min in a dungeon 69,000 79 13 points 6 million miles around the Milky Way the heat we were receiving from out there should have been two degrees colder than the cold the reference but was hotter three degrees hotter than the Milky Way could produce higher than the sum of all the galaxies beyond so we figured it had to be something closer to home we had an idea was that you had the idea I don't remember we had a whole laundry list of ideas maybe it was me maybe it was you your team maybe it was me what was the idea it was so high up to do bomb testing back in the fifties maybe it's like the radiation media is this fall it would diminish over time and what we were getting totally constant no diminish back to the laundry list I of all the Sharma Dennis yes I don't know SH ARMA I think it's a talent Sharma yes frank our I know you Stephen Hawking II plant if you to supervise my PhD too busy was a yes I think so brains polls and cash I'm sorry physics in this country is a battlefield and a bloody one any brains which ought to be enough but it isn't cuz you need cash to fund whatever your brains working on to get cash and a van in this country enables because they'll try and stop you ill C you found a subject any ideas I don't know yet well when you do remember this enough to fight for what you believe in tooth-and-nail on the burgers will stop you physics means everything to him I want him to be happy mister Sean what can I do I want you to settle a question that he can finish something easy enough for him to finish before he dies could you do that please my students and my signs are everything to me I try to be too to both which is why I conduit you ask me talk talk work the I'm sorry the the them close G get science speculation I'm from cancer site weekend here where we going which is time just saw the big questions see Goodison people to be bad idea that no you the greatest achievement to physics in the 20th century method of oppenheimer was a given us you Tomic boom firms two-point in asking we've got here and where we going if I'm Stein and your mom is already got us ready for a new concept that is like being as you can for plane crashes because he discovered gravity fix ever very smart but a small offices real what is it cosmologists aren't interested in real see that go what about Stevens going to make you fall in love with using only Einstein's theory of relativity pound says it can't be done ivory don't think this is a good idea the honor and integrity times subject to take the right right did moon tonight excuse me if you got the time Jays I make it up house at what time do you make it you know that I know my time China be funny times not a universal quantity be used to think that it was used to think that it was just there marching on at the same pace for everyone everywhere like a railway track that stretch to infinity time is a turn numbing there this is incredibly important time stupak next absolute can switch cass is managed stock for puny act heat if you travel East very very quick this tiny the fiery East families completely ants he is completely outta sight nice teaching you time would slow down relative tonight I can't really say if you Perry fast doing very very come home I get really really slow and a time to history times very important on stassney it I didn't right fine here did you want to know who's that Roger Penrose brilliant the process within three years sorry could I thing is just them posting about mathematics not been something Thank You number of different dimensions a call comes out for a critical words and spearing whether I want your fix to the pictures in my head to not make words come using fight song yes please well sky orchestration over the romantic but the displaced the feelings mutual what brahms despised by you can compare the two for 155 yes hello hello I and fight I denmark's present then is the world one a godly one in which there are many confines wallets and dungeons Denmark being one of the worst written notes oh my lord what is known to you for there is nothing either good or bad thinking makes so to me it is a present why venue ambition makes it one but is too narrow for your mind god-like banded in a nutshell cut myself King infinite space but not that I haven't you thinking said thinking about Einstein relativity and starts it's possible for perfect start collapse into death if it's a perfect sphere than cats become infinitely dense so dense that everything is pulled out a knife but the conditions have to be right what conditions yeah if it is perfect sphere plays very moving even it's very beautiful conditions have to be idea it's possible for the poor gravity stop everything escaping everything in life oh no statement but its days so we I'm this consist of the C message and doesn't that's just a two-story lacked some sexual play save his life mom said ok everybody wants Fred I've been thinking about something for you 180 rotation Mach's principle from nations not well defined sheesh my formulations the universe 6 facts as galaxies move apart new galaxies are formed to fill the gaps left behind the new replaces the old at just the right rate nothing changes wherever you are in the universe Andromeda mars oskar opera it always looks the same because it is the same to something significant the universe is a steady-state universe his face track to steady-state and reissuing yes its attractive because this message emotion is far harder to see the universe started doing this as it was being feinstein completed his work as predicting that was a big interview tips run away from the prospect begin now because he saw the beginning would be in a break down to levels assigns how consigned to explain something that isn't that's the thing about the idea of a big bang thing about the idea Big Bang is that it's wrong irrational and wrong it's my turn Big Bang I made it up no I call it that because it sounds like a cartoon Big Bang Theory is cartoon physics than disagrees with me now you dennis lunch the pope was a pic back meant because because before the Big Bang I was nothing no space overtime no matter no science own rules which leaves room for guess who Lord God Almighty alleged is the enemy science and math catholicism at its way would also be living on a flat surface enter the universe with held down below and having just someone to the left of the Moon this in 1963 got is dead stay away from big banks cartoons about Philly white tie electric material I'm sorry lot civic inside the internal at the had to be the cause of the Hess whites die electric material yes pigeon shit all over the phone you know what we did unbelievable unbelievable what did you do we post them the pigeons we posted the picture the people we work for had a internal mail and offices all over america we posted the pigeons as far away as we could send did it work they came on they were homing pigeons they weren't ready to leave so what did you do he here we had been shot no Bob had been shot you killed the pigeons a technician a technician killed the pigeons and then we cleared out all the white dialects material from inside the horn on my hands and knees in a white lab coats inside on scraping away the white stuff and the pieces were innocent hiss was still there the pigeon shit was not the hiss is that right can I say that on television living rooms Dennis and did you know that a small paper do sister utilities Stephen like each other in what lunch with advanced theoretical physics and no pillow tomatoes could do you the slice was offenders yes I'm him at shit don't fuel cells Mozart could go to sleep and we cover the holes symphonies and his head how they got whole symphony in his head complete happen at the music is temple happen you back home symphony just one minutes because music is way off base language and that's what he's thinking that time all roads lead to six fighting for from can exist PT without words

hand an eternity in a our and I'm Eric there was a young lady named bright to speed was faster than light she said that one day in a relative way in return in the previous night up some stable so the go on is unstable you need a negative energy field in order to create the new matter which makes it unstable oil study said it's a problem isn't it isn't it you like cooking very much don't you him we have the time but does he have enough time left to get a disaster I hope so times in treatment theory craft it 3 oil is best you start this is PhD student you to my job you are you no yes he's a great scientist work on the production view him inside styles somewhere beautiful so is this I do the check it should be refereed by committee but all there's not time can IC I'm to go me a few minutes have to go now even with me okay dumps heated home this leave it on my desk said wud up early you want 5 you look like while months I mean nectar so the Royal Society this afternoon giving today this you remember seeing just this its the new theory we have formulated differs in its global implications from the usual theory in that whereas in the usual theory the negative side the constant of proportionality which appears in the field equations is chosen arbitrarily in the new theory has no such ambiguity the sign must be minus and further the magnitude G follows on from a determination and the mean it density matter thereby enabling the cosmologists to know how hard you hit the ground if he falls off a cliff your say something you met your calculation is wrong the advance feel diverges the advance field does not divert I'm afraid us it so wrong would you like to tell us how you know this young man I worked it out you with two houses during the lecture noah hasn't really said eclipse the paper ok what you up to that walk that stones in that ok what you want to it a somebody's for you 27 judging me sis wrong that's all right to say it didn't die the physics is wrong why did you show in the paper I been shown to any ok science is in theater needed to be said in that way how long has it been since you started you don't like the idea it actually studies yet my question because your steady state man yourself okay allows it for you 12 months said the idea me attacking steady-state my father malcolm when I was 21 I told him I wanted to be a physicist adid he wanted to take over the business from sewing tell me but I couldn't be a physicist unless I got a fellowship to pay for it thought it would get Donovan book I worked 11 don't want this to do with me attacking steady it's like to have obstacles in your path I know what it's like to be told you can't do something so I became a teacher I would never ever stop a student of mine from pursuing something because I didn't agree with their opinion never I know you can do more than make brilliant attacks another and do something all year round be original huts run ABS New York maybe the Jesus New York we sit New York how we figured that if any city in the world can give you three degrees hot radio noise must be the big apt my family alone could prolly make this much s we were struggling to think what else it could be you guessing how can we claim to be making very sensitive radio astronomy measurements with all that man-made stuff around we planted the antenna at New York City all that energy spread out across the northern horizon walking from Subway rails home from power lines the radio amplifier at kennedy airport spewing out radio noise but a kilowatt and I'm thinking just maybe trust me this now this town wall towns bike crank up three degrees of its you said you were from Germany when did you leave Germany maybe we should stop filming came to America when I was six years old we lived in a two-room apartment in the garment district be my brother and my parents and the cockroaches in the kitch we were poor that's why I became a physicist at to get rich back to win the Nobel to stop being war New York was in it be point the 21st for the city and it gave us a reasonable amount but not enough heats not enough to win the Nobel Prize you have to find something am i right it's not about thinking on feel it's about discovery but you have to be looking for the same that you find science can be slow work its hardly ever about eureka moments in the bath you need precision tenacity dedication German talents botanical you love at first sight what's scattered act on a multi-core rules rules rules in and been isolated thunder otherwise engaged Stephen you right sign time 50 favorite words is it alright to me to come fine no its not alter I you doing it's in the rules I croquet do so I go again cake you keep doing that because I can so it was supposed to do get your parents Poor's 500 anything is possible and then what what is what you doing cocaine old Offenders Act London each or why each go now whoa new bicep right-o because spend also lives schooling tongue the chalk dust across miles black I don't do that I have something magic and wonderful tell you about fast its rigorous and you don't need big muscles it's called apology pictures not equations nothing response to the life 108 6,000 miles second like is the fastest easy fast enough overcome the capital of say Sun will be a an escape speeds is high enough to get away from the gravity putting it back get the Sun more concentrated what if the Sun collapse the density becomes huge gravity pull enormous now nothing stocks ended peacefully everything in even liked singularity falls the singularity singularities a place where matter lights space time everything folded on themselves and disappear found and total nothing's everything and nothing up until now love you people with your big biceps new big plays into Lewis said thought might be equation is ending a singularity I must be wrong find einstein singularities countries is because those are signs don't allow for wrong singularities to exist perfect spheres for idealized I luv Camille styles real stars do it too singularities on earth there are places where science and rules breakdown where there is no matter no space nothing were everything including time does not exist and when to start collapses singularity is inevitable topology doesn't bother with the messy stuff about particles how they moved and connect big thing big bold think takes you to places with the rules say you can't go and is fast you say that it's fast I've tried to be truthful not in stock there's nothing we can do business treatments this people insipid we've got to keep him from carry on we have to do a lot more than carry of 15b hydroxy cabal I mean steroids I haven't washed my hands if you they're wrong you understand there on the lot in of of stuff of if of he don't ever talk about his illness he doesn't speak about it respect that it's simple really what do you think me having what do you think I should do that's not fair constitute of but if you want to do it myself about to open and upfront nice husband I think it's terrific you don't picking up misses you as well show sir it change dresses in you them anymore nice grace I like a day or two management tonight questions about time with side nice know what she said I know what she wants house God in children with life together impossible said thinking about getting and what you said about him frightening people and that it was just about like to be told that the Sun didn't care about health horrible bolivia is in fact a visit flat Jane of that time it is a flat phone though no fear look me in the eye now and tell me it isn't flat I I don't know what I do had the I V inconsolable totally desolate Stephen Stephen did you have any idea what it might be do you think you knew or was just guessing is that what you're trying to say a Nobel Prize for guesswork is that the story you're after let me tell you something I was the filming got good in 1939 my mother father put me on a train filled with jewish children heading to England Cinda transport are you okay the Nazis were letting some children go not the adults just some children at the station my mother look into my face and said for me to look out for my little brother not to let us a case at my site and don't lose your name tag on a pansy is here you lose a name tag you lose your name when you lose everything and she went a worldly I was 6 you see here again I was 6 my little brother was five she didn't cry she made like it was a normal thing I'm not crying was part of that can you imagine how hard it must have been not to cry to put your boys on the train like that and not to cry 82 cases ever since you liked unpack my mother and my father got a six months later we sailed for America together England save my life America gave me a brand new one but I am never I never dreamed of this happening we discovered this we found this we discovered this what is it on this clock said sign that I got it limit to americans' something's wrong but postings going to be complacent on and then when I came here missus needed often finishes time before he finished it is cheap for Fitch everything stone force fed on stones on school of can you hear me can you we'll see Cambridge C it was nice stand in the way she wasn't said with snow we are having to meet its platform 1 it's never streets routine you don't know what's going to happen next sometimes I tell my husband about it was just listen justice its platform 1 at the Cambridge lots of cool strange things begin to happen just a placeholder Cambridge CBS News's you're a fan of game reached class yes stomach cramps just the direction of time chemist yes and I love you deeply and forever first does C right 10 what if I said I Miss Right about book pot sure myspace what times sign to think about sign going the other way that would work force going to stop you know the present us stereo looking back sign night tension that space building space-time thing I bring spending the night ways to go missiles ok passes SA the same whatever the universe search at the region's countries streets this year singularity nothing is services what's the collapsing through this scene uniting must exist what if it works it is want to walk with me collapse in reverse which an explosion dome if all sorry block yeah all 40 science right why don't you write it down 30 sorry I Trinity schools 0 Rawlings what's the matter with dad he had the ship ash seventeenth-century he calculated that date at the start of the universe hell by adding up of the ages of people in the Old Testament at and how old is the unit that s it starts at some point in the night of the 22nd October four thousand four BC so so old something I want to ask you there was I going when I say station yen Steve you want fanning thing is and Sony with you consider marrying me be inclined to think a few he knew about the same name name tend to think stick not injured thinking that I'm going in the opposite direction what in singularities a collapse everything into nothing yes so University Hines said that cuz thats is an explosion nothing ain't everything talking about stuff no I'm not talking about this stuff and talking about the beginning the universe if there is your friends cabinet me to thank him I come to you could help you he helped himself I think that should preposterous modesty the No a lot if finish on the 16 seem very serious the first three chapters nothing special before months old ok have Dingman yeah because last against the rules I'll aka have to go and see the bass and keys gimme a fellowship you coming the same room for everyone keys no special treatment when it comes to as I'm not like all the rest that's what they all say okay just every Catholic this man cannot walk up stairs you don't sweat it out and he's gonna miss will get place housing easy access you going to quite different when he speaks with you myself this question to my mind the whole shoot courage bring mine got the capacity to imagine face like peace nothing to understand me it's going to be my husband what he's done is to make feinstein work he's made Einstein as word that physicists like to use very occasional beautiful he's made Einstein expert what what is he down you some has opened up something which I thought we all fall is closed I sign appeared to be predicting it and then determine the way could have been again the universe may not always have been if you are right which you not should be some left over radiation from the Big Bang and somebody should have had they haven't I wonder why that could be could be because he's in West the fossil hawking place the fossil we have to go it connects to understand because right to dust out right through trials right through cockroaches in suitcases and rights to America and the American Dream which I have lived you understand me this noise this god damn beautiful hiss it connects it's the sound at the beginning of time leftover heat from the Big Bang 23 degrees that hasn't it's everywhere so all around us 15 years old and we found that's out scarf to go get the prize what was said before the Big Bang whatever it was it wasn't I'm space on that there's room for gold yes in theory so what now thing going to eat canned and the usual numbers chocolate truffles and find very hard you get uses CO wonderful Wagner is and how rom's is not so one min with her at the area everything I've been looking into very big and I want to though can is very small and see how I'm a unified gravity in quantum mechanics hello my Syria take 20 is no more that's fast that fast I believe in the possible I V small knowing I it significantly maybe we can meet you for understanding here i doing you said you fellows moving out the door now down there is profound K I a big things good things to do to do p you hear me E you of in
