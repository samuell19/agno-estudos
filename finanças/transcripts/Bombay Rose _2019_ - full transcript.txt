Your first mistake… was that you assumed you could survive. Your second mistake was that you assumed I was dead. But as long as scumbags like you exist, death itself won't be able to kill me! Hey, you! What the hell! Is this a joke? They censored the kiss! They've ruined it! -Rascals. -You should demand a refund! -I want a refund! -They always censor kissing. -We paid a lot of money. -We won't come here again. Play it again! We want to watch it! -Show us the kiss! -Come on! I need the fresh stuff! Shanta, let's go! Come on! Let's go! Let's get moving! Hey, don't sit! Hand me those baskets. Yeah! How many kilograms is it? Kamala, stop worrying about it! I'm here to take care of Tara. Don't worry. Just go. And Samir will be with his best friend as well. Take my advice, don't get caught up in the hassles of marriage. Are you seeing someone? Let me know if there's someone. I'll talk to him. Sister! Firecracker! Look! I aced my test! Check it out! Well done! You deserve a prize, Firecracker. -It's Tara. -Firecracker. Tara! My little Firecracker! Would you like some ice cream? Don't spoil her, please. One ice cream won't spoil her. Right, Firecracker? Tara! Firecracker! -Will Samir have ice cream as well? -I've locked him up in our home. Why? -Because of the police. -Why? -Because they were rounding up kids today. -Why? Kids who work and don't go to school get picked up by the police. And then? They are rounded up and put in jail. It's a remand home, not jail. -Will they catch me as well? -What? -Why would they catch you? -I work as well, right? Really? What do you do? I clean the house, do the dishes, make tea, fill water-- She's a smart girl! Oh, no! Mrs. D'Souza must be waiting for me. -What about the ice cream? -I'll eat it later with Samir. Easy, Tara. Don't run. Tara will be a lot of trouble. Well, so is Samir, right? Big deal. They're kids, after all. The River Rewa dwells in my eyes The river abides in my eyes Colors that speak of olden lore Perfumes that permeate still do endure Lead me by my hand Into those fragrant times of yore The River Rewa dwells in my eyes Hey, babe. I need two pictures of you. One for the form… and the other to keep in my pocket. They need two photos at the passport office, darling. Those guys are damn fussy. I just saw your little sister. Fifth grade at St. Andrew's. I know. I've been told it's an expensive school. Why waste a lot of moola? She's grown up. She should be working. Stay away from her. Why are you snapping at me? It's for your own benefit. If not now, do it next year. I'll stay away from her. I swear to God. But what if she comes to me herself? Hey, no! Stop the truck, please! No! Stop! He's safe. I thought… Lucky cat! You saved his life. You're a hero. So, I was saying… Do you know what happened? What happened at school? What happened after? I'll tell you. Someone stole my rose yet again. Are you blind? You're always napping on the job! God will never forgive you. BOMBAY WATCH REPAIRS I wonder what it is about the sea… that makes people throng the beaches. To ponder over their dreams? That could be done anywhere. Why come to the sea? Dreams have no boundaries there. I had big dreams for you. I wanted you to finish your studies… and get married-- There you go again. Little dreams might look grand with those magnifying glasses, right? You haven't been to the sea in a while, right? You haven't either. Through my magnifier, a small drop looks like the sea. But you should go there. The river… The river dwells in my eyes The blue sea is your abode, O river! Why do you turn away? The River Rewa dwells in my eyes -How much? -A hundred rupees for ten. -I'll pay you 50. -You can only smell them for 50. -You'll have to pay 100 for the flowers. -I'll take the pink ones. Here you go. The thorns are free. Delivery will not be possible. Satya has been picked up. Hello, Mr. Mishra. -Who picked up Satya? -The same old child-protection police. The kid was put in jail for working. When he scraped by on the streets like a stray puppy, no one cared. The moment I gave him a job, the police took him away. The handicrafts guy, Aamir, stopped taking my calls. When there's a vacancy, he'll call you. But he promised me a job. It costs nothing to make promises. "To each his own" is the rule here. He is from my village. In Bombay, everyone is a Bombayite. Origins don't matter. How long will you depend on Aamir? Start your own business. Right now, a job is all I can aim for. Can you give this to the watchmaker? -Where's Satya? -The child-protection police took him. What's your name? Salim. Salim, the Mughal prince? Where are you from? Kashmir. -You left paradise for earth? -It's not a paradise anymore. It's a little below heaven and a little above hell. -You mean Bombay is hell? -No way. This is paradise. Bollywood paradise! Tell Mishra to put it on my tab. Go on, light it. The watchmaker has asked you to put it on his tab. I have stopped keeping his accounts now. The old man is from our village. He and both his granddaughters were in great trouble. His son was an alcoholic and a gambler. He married his elder daughter off to an aging rich man. Well, he literally sold her off. The poor old man couldn't stand her misery. So, he ran away with both his granddaughters. Initially, it worked out well for them. The girls started school. Business was good. But as the saying goes, "Good times don't last forever." He's been an invalid since then. Now the elder granddaughter is the breadwinner. Can I have a garland? You have no source of income. How will you take care of my daughter? -Father, I will die without him. -Shut up! And you should come back to me only when you have a job. Razia, I got a job! I can't wait to tell your dad about this. No one can stand in the way of our love. No one. Not even God himself! Darkness Darkness Darkness Spread like black tresses The sky, her hair, she graces With garlands of stars so bright O moon, why do you envy her light? And sigh deeply into the night The River Rewa dwells in my eyes The River Rewa My Rewa Dwells in my eyes My house is in Curtorim Salcette My name is Rozalyn Red rose is what they call me When they see me in the village In Walkeshwar, I work In a Parsi's large bungalow And when I walk down the street Young boys pursue me Some bring me chocolate Some want to take me to the movies Some waste my time on the beach Some flaunt their money Run. The cops are here. Run! -Okay, boss! -Careful. Be quiet. Hey, get the ladder! Hey, Thambi. We heard you have kids working here. There are no kids. Shut up, liar. Bhosle, go check the kitchen. Sir, a little something for you. Sir! I've found one! Hey! FLOUR MILL Did you see a kid running? White shirt, shorts… Yes, I did. He went that way. Sister! Sister, didn't I tell you about the hero yesterday? The guy who saved the cat. It's him. Good! What's your name, hero? He can't hear or speak. I was screaming loudly, but he couldn't hear me. Watch this. See? He didn't even hear the police-- -Police? -Yeah. The ones the auntie mentioned. The police who round up kids. Oh, I see. Does he work somewhere? Yeah. I saved him from the police today. He saved the cat, and I saved him. Now, he'll live with us, not in a remand home. No way! We'll get in trouble because of him. I'll drop him back. Let's go. No! He's not going anywhere. Please! The police will arrest him. Please, sister! -Tara, that's enough. -No! -Let go. -Let him stay, please. Let go of him. Current meteorological news. Bombay and nearby areas may see strong winds and high tides in the next 24 hours. People are warned to stay indoors. Fishermen are advised to not go into the sea for the next 24 hours. -This concludes this news bulletin. -Grandpa, what should we do? What can I say? Drop him off where he came from. Sister, I don't want ice cream. Can we let him stay here for a day? Just for a day. Dear, Rewa It dwells in my eyes My heart brims with love My heart brims with love Like a well with sweet water He who drowns in love He who drowns in love Knows its sweetness Like no other What have you done? Get lost! -If he ever comes here again-- -Don't go there. There, never. Bloody Johnny Walker! You? What happened? You got fired? What do we do now? No, my sister will be upset. I can't take you home. Hey, listen! Wait! No. With all its pride and all its valor Bumblebee hovers upon the flower Stop it if you may, halt it if you may They didn't take him back, right? Just a few more days. That's all. Thank you, sister! The heart will nevertheless wander Through ages gone, through ages beyond Its tales of love will fly forever The River Rewa dwells in my eyes The river dwells in my eyes He's a Muslim. Do not forget. What's the problem? They can have a Hindu wedding as well as a Muslim one. Silly girl! That just happens in fairy tales. Two weddings. But in reality, there could be two signatures. One on the papers, and the other, here on my heart, sweetie. Listen, you'll have a great life in Dubai. And my advance? I won't leave without it. I wouldn't let you. If you get paid, it means I get paid. We go fifty-fifty. Got it? Half of you and half of me will complete us both. I happened to see your Romeo. Did you tell him you're already married? Or should I? Careful, Salim. She's Hindu. Who? The jasmine? You know what I mean, right? Champa, Chameli, Gulab… all Hindu names. When did I say that? Give me milds. Gulab could be a Muslim name. Like Gulab Khan. What about Gulab Singh? Or Gulab Chand? And what about Chameli Khatoon? Lovely fragrance. You mean, the scent? -Hey, how much? -Which ones do you want? Come on! Hey! My money? What the hell! -Whose car is this? -The gentleman who just went in. -Pappu, get me a sandwich! -Can I borrow your lipstick? Why don't you buy one yourself? I've heard they're going to shut down all dance bars next month. Listen up, girls. It's a court order. I have an idea. Let's call the judges here. And entertain them. And soothe their bleeding hearts. Don't you understand? You have time. Join the union. They will fight for our cause in court. Makes you cry all the way to the center. Time can shake things up unexpectedly. Miss Salma, I need a sheikh, not a shake-up. Forget the union. Let's go to Dubai and make loads of money. Where are you going? -Dubai? -Yes. They'll seize your passport and force you to work as a maid. My heart brims with love Like a well with sweet water He who drowns in love He who drowns in love Knows its sweetness Like no other My Rewa My Rewa It dwells in my eyes Time is the winding key The body, a mere toy As long as the key is turned There is life, there is joy Over mountains soars the fleeting mind Reined in by the test of time As the sun that rises, bedazzling all Only to set in a blind, fathomless fall How far can one fall? How deep can one fall? How long can one fall? My Rewa My Rewa It dwells in my heart These boys from Goa Are a nuisance for me! They follow me everywhere They just won't let me be They say they want to marry And they want to be with me They have no manners at all And drink all day to nightfall! I wish to tell you something With which you will agree Focus only on studies Fling liquor bottles in the sea This is all you have to do If you want to marry me Look, Kamala! I agree, you shouldn't lie. What if you don't say anything? Here's what I suggest. Don't lie to him. Just don't tell him the truth. Everything will be all right. Trust me! I think Amir is never gonna answer my call. That's the reason I keep telling you to start your own business. Not again, Mr. Mishra. Where am I gonna get the money for the business? -Should I sell my kidney? -That's not what I meant. Could you give this to the watchmaker? Scram, kid! Okay. If you don't repair these, I'll never talk to you. These are Ms. D'Souza's toys. And one day, they just stopped working. -Let's see. -All at once! Mr. Anthony says no one can fix them. Calm down. Magnifier. Spanner. I was your age… when I dismantled my father's expensive watch. I did open it but couldn't put it back together. He spanked my pants right off. Salim! Hello, Mr. Shahid. Aamir called. -Would you like something to eat? -No, thanks. I'm not hungry. It's just a job. You'll find one soon. Tomorrow, if not today. They say, "Tomorrow never comes." My Rewa It dwells in my eyes The river dwells in my eyes The river dwells in my eyes Dear Rewa It dwells in my eyes My Rewa The river dwells in my eyes I have your passport, darling. We just have to wait for the ticket, and then, zip, zap, zoom! You turned out to be a cash cow worth two lakh. Once we go fifty-fifty, I'll become a rich dude… and you, a rich dudess. Come on, let's go. Salim! Your father is leaving. Smoking is bad, but doing it secretly is worse. Smoke with me if you want to. Of course, like father like son. Mom! Dad! Hey, wait. Listen! Thief! The boy is really smart, by the way. Sometimes, it is good to let your tears flow. Or else, as they say… "Little drops of water make the mighty ocean." If the sea fills the heart, why go to the shore? You tell me. Why do people go to the sea? To catch crabs? At the Parsi's house The boy winks at me Calls me a red rose to make fun of me He says he loves me and asks me for a kiss I want none of them I'd rather give him a miss I will marry only a Goan And that's how things will be The Parsi will give me money And also gold aplenty But when I die The Parsi will feed me to the vultures So I shall marry the Goan Who, when I die Shall bury me in the earth -They're not for sale. -Why not? Saving them for your chick, are you? Cut it out. Give them to me. Keep this. This is for the flowers, and this is to stay away from the girl. -Which girl? -You know who. She's Hindu. Stay away. She's off-limits. Find yourself a Muslim girl and buy her a burka with this money. Hey! You rascal! I will… Hit him! Why are they fighting? -Mr. Mishra-- -Hey, Salim! Somebody stop them! -Thrash him! -What happened? How dare you! You won't get away with this! The cops will arrest you. I'll deal with you later. How dare you swear at me! -Stay away from her, I'm warning you. -I swear, I'll kill you. -Why are you inviting trouble? -Let me go! Get away from me. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Hey, arrest her as well! Get her! -What's going on? -Shut up and get in the van. -Get in! -He grabbed me! -Don't you dare touch me! -Stay away! Take it easy, copper. Show me the warrant. Can't you see my bloody uniform? So, it wasn't a rumor. Get in the van! -No! Stop! -All of you! Get in! -Come on! What are you waiting for? -Yeah, I'm coming. If it hadn't been for you… -Hey, don't touch me! -No touching? You have a problem when customers touch you? -Come on! -Let go! -Salma-- -Don't be crazy! She's my friend. Let's go, quickly. I don't want to be a part of this mess. -Come on! Get in! -Take them! Hey, you! Stop! -Did you get the girl from the dance bar? -No, from home. -She's my wife. -You could get in trouble here. -What's your name? -Salim. Take your wife and get out of here. One of the pimps is getting away! Get the scoundrel! You go that way. What about you? I'll be fine. Go that way. Hurry up. I'll be there. Wait for me. Fly away, my phoenix! "Wife." "Fly away, my phoenix." What the hell-- Look, it's Raja Khan! -Wow! -It is Raja Khan! They say that during the night He did nothing but weep They say he refused to eat And drowned himself in his drink They swear the very heavens Trembled at the sound of his cries He suffered for her Even in death, he longed for her He sang He groaned A sorrowful dove In the early morning will sing To a lonely little house With its doors standing open They swear that this dove Is no different than his soul Which still awaits For the ill-fated woman to return Oh, dove Don't cry For these stones Oh, dove What will they ever know Of love? The blue sea is the abode of the river Keep on flowing, pray, do not wither The raging winds softly, to me, whisper The raging winds softly, to me, whisper My Rewa My river, you dwell in my eyes Pray, do not waver Pray, do not flounder Pray, do not surrender O Rewa, you dwell in my eyes Pack your bags, sweetheart. Your ticket is here. Sister! This is Mr. Anthony. Hello. Get some tea for him. Tara told me about Ms. D'Souza. I'm so sorry. We mourn her passing. Shirley has left some money with me for Tara's education. -Ms. D'Souza did? -I'll take care of everything. This way, please. Grandpa… he's here to meet you. He's Mr. Anthony. Remember the toys? So, you're the genius? Those were some toys! And you're some artist! There are more toys and machines if you're willing to repair. I can repair everything. I have an assistant as well. Look at this, sir. This was before it became Timex. I have their Mickey Mouse edition as well! You can't stop grinning at the thought of going to Dubai, right? Don't worry about anything. I'm here to take care of your sister. She doesn't need to be taken care of anymore. -Neither does Grandpa. -What do you-- Why did you tear it? Why didn't you tell me you didn't want to go to Dubai? What's wrong with you? Who's going to pay for this? I'll ruin you and your entire family. I'll tell everyone that you work at a dance bar. Go on. Which dance bar will you say I work at? -The one that was shut down? -You tramp! Where do you think you're going? I'm going to get back at you for this. You'll starve to death! You'll starve without me! Don't mess with me! Nobody messes with Mike! At the Parsi's house, the boy winks at me Calls me a red rose to make fun of me He says he loves me and asks me for a kiss I want none of them I'd rather give him a miss I will marry only a Goan And that's how things will be The Parsi will give me money And also gold aplenty But when I die The Parsi will feed me to the vultures So I shall marry the Goan Who, when I die Shall bury me in the earth
