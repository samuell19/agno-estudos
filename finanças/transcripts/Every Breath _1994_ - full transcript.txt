I thought we had no secrets. It's too personal. Tell me. But I... Please. It's my Viking. Viking? Viking brand ultra strong condoms. The ultimate in protection. Now I know. DIRECTOR: What the hell is he doing? What the hell are you doing? You're ashamed of our product. No, I'm not, I'm not ashamed of the product. I'm just playing the scene as it's written. The scene was written to sell condoms. That's why it's a commercial. I hire you and Viking means shame. Guys all across the country will drop their pants, reach for a Viking and go soft. That's not effective advertising. Next! I'm sorry. [RAINY NIGHTSPLAYING] I hate cavities. They hurt!

So, how did the condom commercial go? Oh, I decided I'm not gonna do commercials anymore. It hurts my movie career too much. You're right. That is so smart. This is my friend Kim. Hi. Hi. Jimmy, can you do your toothpaste commercial for Kim? No. Please? Come on, it's so great. It's great. And if you do, you can make us eat Quaaludes. Well, that's too tough. Okay. You win. "I hate cavities. "They hurt." [SCREAMING] KIM: That's you? I love those commercials. Moments like these make acting worthwhile. Excuse me. Hi. Hi, again. I'm Jimmy. Fuck you. You're like dog shit on the bottom of my shoe. I sense a rift developing between us. Let's not let that happen. Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm late. You look gorgeous in this jacket. Well, thank you. When does your store need it back? You can return it to my house tonight. Who's she? I don't know. Then why are you looking at her? Because I need my head examined. Why don't you come over tonight? I really want to see you. I'll try. Okay. Fine. Hey! Did we work together? Call me when your balls drop.

Anything. [PHONE RINGING] RICHARD: Hello. We're on our way. Does she suspect anything? No. Everything went smoothly. You mean, except for getting beat up and having your car stolen. What? [LINE DISCONNECTS] [CAR STARTING] LAUREN: My husband, Richard, he's wealthy. JIMMY: No, shit. Wow. Where do we check in? I'm so glad you came. It's so nice of you. Don't worry about it. No, really. It shows you have a lot of personal integrity. You slay me. You really slay me. Why is that? I have no idea. I think it's because you see past all my bullshit. Whatever you say. You think I'm a fucked up, manipulative bitch, don't you? Basically, yeah. Well, I think you're just a stupid actor. [BRAKES SCREECHING] [GASPS] Oh, no. [CHATTERING] How can you do such a thing? It's my husband. He said he was going to be gone until tomorrow. Oh, my God. Well, let's just go. I didn't tell Richard I was leaving him. I was out all last night. That's why he wants to kill me. He doesn't want to kill you. You don't understand. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to scare you away. Richard is an arms dealer. He's deeply psychotic person. What shall I do? No way. Oh, Richard. Not again. Again? He's done that before? Yes. He's killed people before? Yes. Oh, shit. I have to get you out of here. Oh, God. Oh, God. I know. Just walk right past him. Walk right past him? Are you on acid? I'll say you're Joe from my acting class and we were rehearsing, okay? Smile, be casual. This is Joe, from acting class. How's life, Joe? Life's great. Well, so long. I don't think you should leave, Joe. Why don't you stay for a drink? Well, I'd love to, but I can't. Thanks anyway. I think you can. Well, if you insist. I do. Excuse me. I'm going to go slip into something a little less comfortable. James, did you fuck her? No. You know, I'm not paying you until you fuck her. I understand. Listen, why don't we just call this whole thing off? I didn't know anyone was getting killed. We have an agreement. Well, murder wasn't part of the agreement. You didn't tell her I was paying you, did you? Of course not. Then you'll stay and do the job. I'm sorry. Take another step and I'll cut you in half. I promise I will not say anything to anyone.

Well, then you must be very happy. Are we amused, precious? Oh, he won't cooperate. Say your prayers now. Give him another chance. What do you have in mind? LAUREN: If he satisfies me, let him live. Good luck. Do you want me to hit you? Would that help? No, no thanks. I... I just can't do it with you watching. There is no point of doing it if Richard can't watch. Well, I'm sorry. Pathetic. Besides, it's way past our bedtime, Lorelei. I have one, now two corpses to bury in the morning. So, let's kill him, sweetheart. I'm tired. Get off him. No, please. Please don't. Stay, stay. And I was so wet. Goodbye. You can't do this. I'm a well known commercial actor. If you kill me, lots of people will come looking for me. Lots of people will thank me. Wait. Wait, think about this.

[RICHARD LAUGHING] You were just faking. Oh, come on, we are not going to kill you. RICHARD: You were quite good, James. Very believable. Particularly that bit toward the end. Personally, I think you were better in that dentist commercial. It was toothpaste, and fuck you both. It was just a game, you big galoot. You're both in deep shit with the police. I'm sure the cops will be very sympathetic. Particularly when you explain how you were abused while turning a trick. I don't need this. RICHARD: James... Wasn't it just this afternoon you were complaining to me how terribly in debt you are? I'll deal with it. Suit yourself, kid. What a dud. What a dud of an evening. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry I got mad at you at the party. I probably deserved it. Are you all right? I hope so. Where have you been? I got lost. Are you scared? Yes. Why? You know you're dreaming. When I pull the trigger you're not going to die. You'll just scream and wake up sweating. [GASPS] Bad dreams? Very. Let me distract you. I'm okay. Why are you being so mean to me? I'm not being mean, I told you I just had a nightmare. Why won't you make love to me? Nightmare's don't make me feel all that sexy. Jimmy? Is there something you're not telling me? Sarah, let's just go back to sleep. Please don't lie to me. I'm not lying. Good night. Good night. [DOOR SLAMS] Couldn't stay away, could you? I just came by to tell you I'm not going to the police. I'm leaving town anyway. I can't stand this fucking shithole anymore. But you two have to stop playing these games. Someone's going to get hurt. Only a weakling like you. It's a waste of time trying to help you. Don't pretend that you're here for any other reason than to enlist in some more fun and games. That's not true. Your sweet girlfriend doesn't do it for you anymore. I know you tried to forget about our night together, but you couldn't, because being beaten up, tied up and scared to death made you feel alive for the first time in your miserable, little life.

Well, have you seen a guy wearing stone washed jeans and a tan "Members Only" jacket? No. It's so weird. I think I just saw my date leave with another girl. Oh, I'm sure you're mistaken. I'll help you find him. This is unbelievable. Oh, wait. There he is. Bob! Bob! This is unbelievable! Do you have a car? Do you mean here or in general? Here. No. Come on. We'll take a cab.

I don't understand what's happening. How could you do this? Mimi, go home. No. Bob, please. Go away. Oh, shit. Babe, don't let this spoil our evening. Hey, wait! Where are you going? [STAMMERING] Home. I just wanna go home. [LAUREN LAUGHING] Well, then... Goodbye. Come on, kid. Don't mull over them. Let me show you one of my collectibles. RICHARD ON SCREEN: Look at me, Lorelei. I'm just your mirror. Your undressing for him for the first time. And you're thinking about it in front of the mirror. Look at yourself. Babe, you are totally hotter than an atomic blast. I'm gonna call you tomorrow. Don't bother, you village idiot. Yeah. RICHARD ON SCREEN: Yes. Visualize... Hello? People, I'm finished. Hey, guys, where are you? I miss you.

RICHARD: What am I doing? This is no time. [SOBBING] RICHARD: Look at me. This is your mirror. How could you? How could I what? Take pleasure in my pain. Well, you seemed to be having a pleasurable time with Bob. That didn't make me feel real good. Then why didn't you stop me? Why didn't you say something? I was waiting for you to make a move, but you just stood there. Coward. How was I supposed to know what you wanted me to do? If you cared about me you would have. Let go of me. Calm down, child. Let go of me, you fucker. It's all over, the whole thing. Hysterical exit number two. [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRASHING] [HORN HONKING] Lauren! Are you all right? Yes. I'm so sorry I laughed at you.
