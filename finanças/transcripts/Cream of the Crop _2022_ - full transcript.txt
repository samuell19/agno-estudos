- Oh, I can't believe it. - Oh, rough morning? - Hey. Yeah, you could say that. - Why, what's wrong? - It's just something I saw on the way over. - Okay. Hey, don't forget about tonight. - Uh, tonight? - Yeah, my brother's birthday, remember? - I forgot. - Meet me there at seven. You have the address, right? - Yes, but, I'm not really invited. - Yes, you are. I invited you. - Okay, okay, I'll be there. - You need some fun. - Good morning. Sorry I'm late, guys. All right, if we could please take our seats. All right, girls I'm gonna have you pass out these folders and we're all gonna take a couple of notes before we feed up. - Notes? Do we have to? - Just a few. And then you can take care of the animals both inside and out. But first, we need to get a little perspective on what it might be like to pursue your goals of farm life. Let's talk stats. Now, did you guys know that farming is one of the most dangerous occupations? It's near the top of the list with 25 deaths for every 100,000 workers. - Yeah, remember that guy that fell off the silo ladder last year? It was like 10 miles from here. - Yeah, I knew that guy and it's not just the danger. I mean every year of farming is a crap shoot due to weather, falling prices, even government policies. You could be in business successfully for 10 years and lost it all on your 11th. - My uncle lost his farm. Had to auction off everything. Didn't get much back. - And that is happening more and more. Banks foreclose, developers move in and pretty soon there's no farms left. Even if you work really hard, 'cause guys, you have to understand that farming, especially dairy farming is seven days a week. There's no going to the beach on the weekends. - Yeah, Holly, forget working on your tan. - Except maybe a farmer's tan. - All right, all right, guys. That's enough. It can be difficult to get into. There's a saying that you either marry the farm or inherit it. Did you know that the average age of the farmer is 58 years? So, I do hope that some of you guys will try it. We can definitely use you. - Thanks for the encouraging words, Ms. Stafford. - All right, now that's enough for today. Tomorrow we will talk about some of the more positive aspects of farming. Now Caroline, Bella, if you will feed the goats outside. Riley, Alexis will take care of the chickens. Everyone one else will feed up in here. Thanks, guys. - You made it. I was worried. - I told you I'd be here. I just, I feel weird. - Why? - I don't know anybody. - Well, you know me and here's a run down on the name characters. So Mike, who's turning 28, he's my brother, so naturally I think he's a jerk, but he's actually a pretty nice guy. And then there's Matt, our older bro. He's going through a divorce right now, so he's living with Mike. As far as the other guests, your guess is as good as mine. I do know one thing. Our parents are not invited, so, okay, brace yourself. - Okay. - Have you ever thought about living on your own? - No, I have to be home on the farm to help my family. Looks really fun, though. - Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug. - Whoo! - So, there's the birthday boy and our older brother, Matt. - Nice. - Oh, he's not always like that. - Check this out. - He's really stressed out at work and, hey, it's his birthday. Mike. Mike. Mike. - What, what? - Hey, I want you to meet somebody. - Who? Oh. This is Jodi, Jodi Stafford. - Hey. - She lives out on Stafford farm. You know, on Limestone Road? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - She invited me out there next week to help out around the place. - So you're gonna be on a farm? What if your hair gets messed up or if you break a nail. I get it, you're gonna go can some jam and bake some whole wheat bread, right? And you're gonna teach her? That's great. - Hey, you know what? I've got an idea. How about you come help out on the farm? You think you can handle it? - Me? No. I eat Wonder Bread, right? - Mike. - Okay, fine, I'm sorry. I, um, farming? Yeah, that sounds different. Um, yeah, why not, I'm up for it. What about tomorrow? - Okay. I'll pick you up at 5:30. - AM? - Yeah. - Yeah, no problem. - All right, well, I'll see you at 5:30 then. - Definitely. Bright eyed and bushy tailed. - Hope so. Um, Lynn, I'm gonna head out. I have an early morning tomorrow. - You just got here, though. Okay, all right. I'll walk you out. You're gonna like her. - All right, all right, here we go. Got a surprise. - Round two. - I got a surprise. - All right, here we go, ready? - You're gonna like him. - Right. - Three- - Two, one, go. - Go, go, go. - Whoo. Come on. - Mike? Mike? Mike? Mike? - Oh, what? What? - Hi. It's Jodi. I'm here to pick you up, remember? Remember Jodi from the party? From the party? - Oh. The party. That was a bad idea. - Well, are you coming? - Am I coming? With you? - Yeah, that's the idea. So, today or? - Sure. Just, um, hey, if you would just give me like a second or like a minute. That was a good party. - I'll just wait here. - Ready. - Okay. - Is something wrong? - No. No. Not at all. Let's go. - I'm so sorry. Do you mind just, uh, not doing that so loud, please? - Sorry. How do you feel? - Oh, fine, just fine, you know. Good. Ow! Holy. - I, I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. Are we, uh, we here yet? - We are there. - Wow, this is nice. - Thanks. - Hi, guys. All right. Ready? - Yeah. Hey, wait, what is that guy doing? - Oh, that's my dad. - That's your dad? - Yeah, he's just getting the chickens ready for market. Come on, I'll show you. - That's great. That's great. - Hey, Daddy. - Mm-hmm. - Daddy, this is Mike Jared. Remember my friend, Lynn. This is her brother. - How do you do, sir? - No use complaining. - Right. - Um, Mike came to help out today. - Oh, really? Okay, Jodi. Let's see how you do today, Mike. - Come on, I'll show you around. - Wow. God. Was your dad wearing like a baseball mitt or something. - What? - Yeah, his hands, it felt like it was like, uh- - Leather. - Yeah and- - So big. - I mean, yeah. - Yeah, that's from 50 years of milking cows. They just got like that. - Oh. Could you excuse me for a minute, please. - Next time, boy, clench your teeth. Save some of them big chunks. - Daddy. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Uh, do you want some breakfast? - No, no, hey, no, thank you, no thanks. Just, um, hey, you go ahead, I'm good. - That's okay. Um, hey, you know what, maybe I should just take you back. Here, come on. - Aw, man. I'm, uh, I'm really sorry about this. - No, I'm sorry. You weren't feeling well. - I wasn't feeling well. - Yeah. - Um, maybe you can come back another time. - Maybe, yeah. - When you're feeling better. - Yeah. - Wow. Okay then. Coming? - Yeah. Hmm. - Hi, Mom. - Hey. - Where did you get him? - I told you, Daddy, he's Lynn's brother. - And has that boy got a job? - Yeah. Yes, he does. - What does he do? - I haven't asked him yet, but I think he makes good money. - Won't last long around here. - He wasn't feeling well. - I could see that. - He'll be all right. - Nope. - What's up, Mikey? - Who wants to know? - Ooh, touchy, aren't we? - Why not? - Jodi. - What? - You have a call, you forgot your phone? - Who is it? - He says it's Mike. He sounds very polite. - Oh, uh, okay, I'll be right there. Thanks. Hello? - Hey, Jodi. This is Mike. - Who? - The guy who lost the big chunks this morning. - Oh, right, how could I forget. - Yeah, so, you know to tell you the truth, the strangest thing just happened. Yeah, I put on an old pair of pants and found a $50 bill in my pocket. So, anyway, I was just thinking that since I have this extra $50 and all that maybe, you know, you'd like to help me spend it. - Uh. Well, I'd like to, but the thing is it's getting real busy around here right now and I'm working almost every night unloading hay and I just- - Okay, yeah, no problem. - Wait, um, how about you save your $50 for now and just come over again. We could go riding or something. - Riding? You mean, like a horse? - Yes, a horse. I don't have a Harley. - A horse , of course. I've done that. - Okay, um, how about tomorrow? - 5:30 again? - No, um, eight's fine. - Oh, I'll be there. - Oh, and I promise no chickens this time. - Thanks. - All right, I'll see you then. - Use the old $50 bill line on her? - Yeah, but it didn't, it didn't work. - We'll see how long you last. - What are you looking at? - Not much. - Hey, you made it. - Yeah, at your service. What are we gonna do first? - Well, uh, we're just about finished milking. How about a guided tour of the cow stables? - I would like that. - Come on. It's right this way. - Right. - Here we are. - Hey, you guys use machines? - What do you mean? - Well, you know, I just wanna milk by hand. - Uh, yeah, yeah, we use machines. And hey, guess what, we have indoor plumbing, too. - Really? - Hey, Jodi. Give me a hand with this heifer, will you? - I'll be right back. Make yourself at home. This is my brother, Frank, and our hired hand, Willie, guys, this is Mike, I'll be right back. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Mike, let me show you something. - Yeah, what's up? - Have you ever seen the pattern at the end of a guy's teat before? It looks just like a star, it's fascinating. - No, no, I can't say I have. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, look right here, right here. - Oh! - Frank! - It just came out. I thought this cow was dry. - No, no, it's cool, it's fine. - You okay? - Is there anything? - Yeah, you'll be fine. Um, sorry about that. Come on, um, you can help me pick up the eggs. - Okay. - See you later now, Mike. - See you. - Willie! I'm sorry, don't worry about them. Come on, let's go. - Get that one. Just reach in. - Right there. - Yeah, just reach your hand in. - Easy. - Oh, yeah. See this? Come on, buddy. He hates me. - You wanna hold him? - I would, yeah, let's do it. Take, take, take it. - There you go. - You good? Oh, God. - Oh, really, that's amazing. Hey, Willie? Where's the restroom? - Right over there will work, huh? - Yeah, man, it's fine. - Okay. Oh, man. - Hey, where'd you go? - Oh, just, you know, looking around. - Oh, well, you're gonna ride Billy. It's my dad's horse. His trots a little bumpy, but he's real quiet. - That's great. Yeah. - You have done this before, right? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - All right, let's mount up. - Mount up. - Not bad, here, let me give you a lift. - Yeah, it's just that the jeans are tight, you know. - Yeah. - Just give me a little- - All right, one. - Something. - Two, three. - Gah! - What's wrong? - Nothing, I'm just, you know, a little tight. It's been a little while. - All right, let's get this. Here. And, reins. - Yeah. Wow, that was good. - I've done it a few times. Ready? - Oh, yeah. Go, go, go, go, go. Come on. Ah! Don't wait up. I'm good. Ugh! What the heck have you been doing? - Farming. - No, no, don't sit on that. Go get in the shower, man. Oh, God. God, Mikie, is she worth it? - Yeah. - Hey. What are you doing here? - Well, I was just checking out a property and I'm driving by and I thought I'd, you know, stop by and see what you do here all day. - Too late. Day's over. You're, um, visit wouldn't have anything to do with a fellow teacher of mine, would it? - What? No. - That's too bad 'cause here she comes now. - Hi. - Hey, Jodi. - What are you doing here? - Oh, it's funny, I asked the same question. - Well, I was- - Oh, he was just driving by. Sorry. I'm late for something. Mike, why don't you walk Jodi to her truck. - Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, it's no problem at all. - It's, you really don't have to. - It's fine. I have so much time before my next appointment. - Okay. Are you okay? - I'm fine, couldn't be better. - You sure you're okay. - Absolutely. - Not to be rude, but is it for a doctor's appointment? - Doctor? Oh, no, no, this is, it's for my job. - Ah. Well, uh, what time? - Um, oh, geez, it starts in five minutes. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm keeping you. You should go. - No, it's, um, it's fine. Will I see you around? - Well, actually I was wondering if you might want to come over for dinner tonight? If you're not busy. - Well, why don't you take me up on my offer to help you spend my 50 bucks, 'cause, you know, that's not gonna last forever. - Okay. How about a compromise? I'll go out with you if you come over for dinner first. - Will your parents be there? - Yeah. - Just, I have a feeling sometimes they don't like me. - Look, they will. It just takes them a while to get used to somebody new coming around. You'll see. Uh, 6 o'clock okay? All right. Don't be late. Peas? - I heard Walt Crossen has to sell? - I saw that comin'. - Yeah, he didn't have much of a crop this year to begin with. - And then the four-wheelers. - Oh, hey, my brother actually bought a couple of really nice four-wheelers for my nephews. Give them something to do, hopefully keep those guys out of trouble. - Yeah, four wheelers. Ruined half the man's crop just playing around. Little bastards. - Oh. - So, what does your family do, Mike? - Uh, my dad is a partner in a law firm and my mom's an interior decorator. - Oh, how nice? What about you? Jodi says you have a good job? - Yeah, he's an astronaut and he's taking up space. - Daddy. - Um, I'm a real estate marketing specialist for a company called Poole and Associates. - Yeah, yeah, I've heard of them. They're the ones building all those McMansions out on Walker's Road. That used to be good land until the bank foreclosed. - Mike, would you like some more oysters? - Oh, it's oysters? I didn't realize these were oysters. I've never seen anything like this. Is it like blue point? - Mountain. - Mountain? - Mountain oysters. You know the low hanging fruit of the bull. - Bob! - Mm, I'm sorry. - It's not funny. - Stop. - You know that'd boy grow more if he could keep some food down. - Daddy! Why? - Hi. Just too much. - Feeling better? - I could definitely use a beer. - Well, do you wanna go to the Triple Nickel? It's right up here. It's a country place, though. What? - Do they have beer there? - Yes, turn left up here. - Well, hello there, Jodi. - Hey. - How's your daddy? - He's fine, ornery as ever. - Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. - Oh, Mr. Miller, this is Mike. Mike, this is Mr. Miller from the farm down the road. - How do you do? - I'm doing great. Pleasure to meet you, Mike. Enjoy. - Have a good night. - Thank you. - I really am sorry about dinner. - Oh, no, no, no, no, it's okay, really. Just don't worry about it. - I guess I just wasn't thinking about what we were having. - Well, the chicken casserole was really good. - Chicken? - Yeah, it was in the bowl next- - That wasn't chicken. - No, no, no, no, you really, you don't have to tell me. - Okay. - What can I get you? - Two of whatever's on tap. ♪ I'm more than a $10 drink ♪ - I love this song. ♪ More than a smile and a wink ♪ ♪ Oh, lonely boy ♪ - Do you wanna dance? - Sure. - Oh, here he comes. Now's our chance. ♪ But you're going through the motions ♪ ♪ You're stealing my part ♪ ♪ When you got every notion ♪ - We're gonna go ledge city boy's car out there. Randy, you, too, come on. ♪ Fill an empty space ♪ ♪ If only boy you get to know me boy ♪ ♪ I'm more than a $10 drink ♪ ♪ More than a smile and a wink ♪ ♪ Oh, lonely boy ♪ - What the he-? - Oh, no. - Aw! Are you kidding me? - I guess they were looking for something to do. - Something to do? Something to do? God, what am I supposed to do? It's no problem. Stay back. - Mike! Mike! Mike, you're too close to the ledge, you'll never make it. - Watch me. Get in. See you later, suckers, yee ha! Whoo! It's a nice view. - Right. I love it. I could come up here a million times and never get tired of it. - Oh, so you just park here all the time, huh? - No, but I ride Dixie up here a lot. - Yeah, you must really love this place. - It's the only place I've ever known. I grew up here and so did my father and his father bought the land when he was young and farmed it. I guess it's in my blood. - I, I don't get it. - What? - Like why I'm here. - Gee, thanks. - No, I'm just, all right, think about it. The first time I come over to your house on some mad mission to prove myself or whatever, I tossed my cookies in your yard. Then, I come back and make a complete idiot of myself. Tonight, I completely degrade myself in front of your parents and then I almost get myself killed trying to get this car off a ledge. So, what? Am I being tested by God or something? - Maybe. - Or maybe there's some kind of fatal attraction. - Maybe that, too. - Maybe I'm starting to realize there's a lot more to life than just making my future millions in real estate. - I hope so. Speaking of, I really wish I'd known your career path before tonight. - Well, you didn't ask. Like I never imagined it'd be a problem, you know, and I was gonna tell you at school and then I had to rush off like that. - No, I, I'm trying not to let it be a problem. It's just- - I get it. I do have a question, though. - What's that? - The second time you ride a horse, can you walk the next day? - Sometimes. The hayfield. - What do you mean? - Mike there's four wheelers in the hayfield. We gotta go. - Okay. - Hey, four wheelers. Four wheelers in the field. - No! - Let's go. Let's go, let's go. - Hey, what should I do? - Frank. - Wait! All right. Oh, no, no. All right. Okay. Hey, boy. Good boy. You remember me? Stupid mutt. Okay. - He, Duke, shute up. - Oh, great. Good evening, sir. - What the hell are you doing up there? - I, uh, Jodi and I, we were up on the hill and then we saw- - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, no, I mean, no I mean, we weren't doing anything. I don't do, I would never do anything, you know. - Uh-huh. - Oh, God, oh, man. - Hey! Bastards. - The four wheelers, they're in the field. That's where we're going. - You won't shoot farm boy. - Watch me, you son of a bitch. - Dammit. - Willie, you jackass. - Get up, idiot. - Willie, Willie. - I planted that field. - I know. Take a walk. - Oh, my God, look what you did. - What are you talking about, boy? Did you see what you did to my hay? - Danny? - Uncle Mike. What are you doing here? - No, the question is what are you doing here? - This is your nephew? Well, that figures. Frank, go get the John Deere with the loader and turn him over. Get him out of here. Jodi, call the cops. - The cops, for what? - I'm filing charges. Trespassing, destruction of property and whatever else I can get you on. - What about the guy with the gun? He shot at me. I could get him for attempted murder or something. And what about the damage to my ATV? - You're pathetic. - Hey, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, just wait, okay. Danny, you've caused way more financial damage to them than they did to you and you get get someone for defending their own property. Look, Mr. Stafford. Look, somebody Danny wants to go to law school. All right? And if he has a record, he may not be able to get in. You don't want him to go to jail, do you? - Hell, yeah. - Okay. I see your point. But I promise that I'll make sure that nothing like this ever happens again, okay? Right, Danny? - Yeah. - Right, Danny? - All right, sorry. - Frank, tow him out of here. We gotta milk in four hours. Let's get some sleep. Well, I just scored about a million more points with your dad. - You stood up to him, he likes that. - Oh, yeah, I can tell. - No, trust me. I know him. - Come on, you two, let's get outta here. Come on, let's go. Hey, boy. - Mike, Daddy, his name is Mike. - Oh, yeah, excuse me, Mike. Have you ever baled? - Uh, baled? - Yeah. - Yes, sir, on a camping trip. Yeah, the canoe sprung a leak and so I was- - Hey, he means have you ever baled hay? - Uh, no, um, no, sir. I have not. - Well, be here tomorrow. Maybe you'll learn something. - Tomorrow, yeah, uh, is 6 a.m. okay? - You don't bale until afternoon when the dew dries. - Of course you don't. - And, oh, I should warn you, we still bale the old-fashioned way. Grab it when it's ready. - I got you, is this, one sec. - Don't be scared. Oh, thanks, sorry. You all right? How are your hands? - Oh, there's no blood yet, so. - Daddy, why'd you stop? - Hey, boy, don't you think I wore gloves the first time I baled. Kids. - That's good. - Okay. - You'll thank him later. - Oh, yeah, I will. - Thanks. - It's so easy. With the gloves. - Told you. - Good job. - Nice job. - Thank you. - Hello, son. - Dad, Dad, I'd like you to meet Jodi. Jodi Stafford. - Jodi, so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Please sit down. You know, son, your mom couldn't make it. Problems with a client. You know how her job is. - Sure, Dad. - Hi, Mr. Jared. Can I offer you a drink? - My usual please. - How about you? - Just a soda for me, please. - All right, and I'll do the same. - Terrific, be back in a minute. - So, Jodi, what do you plan on doing with your summer now that school's out? - Well, I'll be working at home. We're still milking twice a day and doing some baling. Mike's gotten really good handling a bale. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Sounds like a wonderful life. Farming. You know, your mom's been pestering me about buying a piece of land somewhere out in the boondocks. Says she wants to be able to get away from the working world. I don't know. - Will you excuse me just for one minute? - Seems like a nice girl. - Dad, why? - By the way, I saw Jim Poole the other day. Real estate is booming apparently. It's uncanny how this guy always seems to get the best deals. Said he just bought a piece of land for a song. Were you in on that deal? - No. Not that one. - He's got a lot of wonderful things to say about you, son. Says you'll really rise up in this company if you'll stick with it. - Oh, yeah. - You know I'm proud of you, son. I pulled a lot of strings to get you there and you haven't let me down. - Uh-huh. Uh, you know I've actually been working at the Stafford farm in my time off. - Mr. Stafford? - Jodi's father. He didn't like me much at first, but I think I'm starting to make a good impression on him. I'm really learning a lot. - Learning a lot about what? Pitching manure? - No. Yeah, a little. I don't know, it's just, after a day's work there, you actually feel like you've accomplished something. - Accomplished? Mike, when you're working on developing a piece of land, watching those buildings rise, providing people with jobs, a decent place to shop, I mean, that, that's accomplishment. - Yeah, it's, I don't know. - Son, you gotta know what I'm talking about. I mean, look at the money you're making. A whole lot more money than I ever did at your age. Look, I know you like this girl and all, but- - Jodi. Dad, her name is Jodi. - Whatever her name is. Just don't lose sight of where your real responsibilities lie. At any rate, Jim's expecting great things from you. - Hey, it's George Moore. Morning, George. - Hey, Florence, how are you? Bob. - What brings you out? - Well, nothing good. - Come on, George, sit down, have some pie. - No, thank you, Florence, yeah. - What do mean nothing good? - Walter Patterson's had an accident. Must have had his shirt cuff undone or something and got it caught up in the PTO shaft. Ripped his shirt clean off. Caught his arm up in it, too. Mangle it up pretty bad. Doctor says he might not ever have full use of it again. - Oh, Lord, how's Ruth? - Well, you know, she's at the hospital with him. She been there all day. - Well, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. I figured we'd come up with some kind of a plan or a schedule, get in his wheat and his hay, get his milking done for him and Clyde, Bill, Ted Dawson said they'd pitch in and lend a hand, too. - We'll be there. - Thank you, Bob. Boys. Florence. - See you, George. - All right, George. - Bob, how are you gonna do it? You're so far behind yourself. - Yeah, I know. It's gotta be done. I mean, they'd do the same for us. - I know they would. - I can work overtime and that extension agent from down state is coming tomorrow. He might help out. And there's always Jodi's boyfriend. - Yeah, that boy's trying, though. - Yeah. - She won't have a boyfriend after her fancy lunch today. She's probably dumping soup in his dad's lap right now. - Frank. - Well, come on, we got work to do, let's go. We'll see you later. - Okay. - Thanks. Need a hand? - Oh, nah, I got it. - Hey. You don't put gas in a diesel tractor. - Something must have gone wrong with the equipment. That gets him madder than anything. - Can't blame him. I'm the same way. - Hey, why don't you set your suitcases down by the truck for now and I'll take you down to meet him. Maybe that'll calm him down. - Lucky I caught that when I did. Now, I gotta drain the tank and hope that it starts okay. I mean the John Deere's already broke down. I don't have time for this this week. - Mr. Stafford, I'm so sorry, I just, I got into the wrong tank and- - Yeah, you sure did. All right, now the front loader's broke down. Now we're gonna have to finish loading the manure spreader by hand. Do you think, do you think that you can do that without breaking something? - Daddy. - What? - Daddy, this is Skip Stevens, the extension agent. - Glad to know you. I'm sorry about all the commotion. - This is my dad, Bob Stafford. This is my brother, Frank. And, uh, Willie our hired hand. - Gas instead of diesel fuel? - Yeah, dad gum it. - Daddy, it's not his fault. The tanks aren't even marked. - Yeah, but lucky I caught it when I did. If I would have started the tractor, it would have ruined the motor. - You know, we had a hired hand do the same thing once. I drained the tank then. I could do it for you now. Just let me change my clothes. - Nah, don't trouble yourself. You're our guest here. - No, I'm happy to do it. Just give me a minute. - It's really nice of you to help out. - Yeah, it's not a problem. Well, the sooner it get done, you know, the sooner I can get to work. - Yeah, I know, it'll be helpful. - That was a blessed meal, darling. - Thank you, dear. - Sure like what you did with the tractor. Ran like a charm this afternoon. - Well, while I was in there, I changed the fuel filter. I like fooling around with engines. - Skip's actually speaking at the local ag conference tomorrow with a couple of other speakers. - Oh, yeah, who else? - Kelly Grant from upstate. He's talking about manure management. - Yeah, I know him. He stayed with us last year, nice guy. Jodi had a big crush on him, didn't you, Jodi? - Shut up, Frank. - So what's your topic, Skip? - One of my sessions is on pasture management and poisonous weeds. - That sounds fascinating. What about your other session, Skip? - I'll be discussing the future of farming, trying to motivate young farmers and others to pursue agricultural careers in tough times, the importance of farming in today's world and how everyone can make an impact on the future. - Well. - Oh. - Well, we sure need someone promoting the farm way of life. People getting too far away from it and you can't understand something that you're too far away from. - Well, thank you so much for dinner, Mrs. Stafford. It was really good, but Jodi and I better get going. Moving starts in half an hour. - Oh, that's right. - Oh, wait, Jodi, I thought you and Mike were going to stay and watch Skip's presentation of the ag delegation trip to Japan? - Oh, well. - I always like a presentation. Like a PowerPoint? - Well, I would like to see it, but let's go to the movies. I can see it some other time, right? - But he'll only be here two weeks and, you know, he's gonna be busy. - Hey, you just stay. I'll go home. I've got some work to do. - No, no, no, no. - Yes, it's fine. I'll call you later. Thanks again, Mrs. Stafford. - You're welcome. - Hey, Mike. Who wants dessert? - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Hello? Mike, hi. Oh, today? It's, yeah, well, Frank and I were gonna go down to the conference center to hear Skip speak, but I'll be home by six. Oh. Okay. Call me tomorrow? Oh. Well, I'll talk to you soon then? Are you sure? Okay. All right. Bye. - Morning. - Morning. - Nice horse. - Thanks. - You sure it's all right me borrowing the truck this week? I could just rent a car. - Oh, no, it's fine. I don't need it when school's out. - Oh, thanks. I'll have to thin of some way to repay you. - That's okay. Uh, I'll see you this afternoon? - Yeah. I'll be back to pick y'all up around 1 o'clock? - Sounds great. See ya. Frank! Go home, girl. Frank, Frank, oh. Frank. Okay. Oh, God. Frank. No, hang in there, Frank. Help will be here real soon. Please, God. Help! Help! - Bob! - That rope. - Bob! - Come on, let's go. - Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender. - He's going to be fine. His nose is broken, but we can fix that. And he does have a concussion, so he'll have to take it easy. You can see him now if you want to go in. Just the parents at first. We don't to overwhelm him. - Thank God. - You know he wouldn't have made it at all if you hadn't been there. If he'd fallen off the tractor. - Don't, don't even say it. - I wonder how the rock got in there in the first place. - I know how it got in there. - Willie, it wasn't anyone's fault. - I'm sure that's true. - Yeah, right. - What'd you say? - Mike. Maybe you should just go home. Mike, wait. Mike. Mike, where are you going? - Where am I going? I'm going home. Isn't that where you told me to go? Yeah, that's the best place for me. - Just wait. - No, don't worry about it because this is my fault. It's my fault for thinking that any of this was gonna work out. God, I've been working my butt off trying to impress you and your family. - You have. - And, sure, look at this. This accident was probably my fault. How do you think that makes me feel. And then you, I really started to think that there may be something here. And then mister ag extension shows up and you act like I'm not even there and then you just, just a second ago you sounded like you were sending me to my room for being bad. I mean... Look, I'm, I'm sorry, you're right. I don't belong here. My dad was right. It's time that I started to focus on my real job. So if you could just tell Frank that I'm sorry. I've gotta go. - Mike. Mike. - Hey, back from the hospital? - Yep. - How is he? - He's gonna be fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. - How are you? - Me? I'm just fantastic. - Okay. By the way, your boss called. - What did he want? - To say he's got some new project he wants you to work on. He said it can wait until he sees you tomorrow. - That's great. I'm gonna hit the hay. - Is that a newly learned farm expression? - That's very funny. - Hey, Mike. - Yeah. - It never would have worked out. - Jodi. Jodi. - What, Dad? - I think it's clean. - Oh, man. - All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'. - Hello? - Yep. - Hey, Willie. - She's not here. Well, she must have forgot her cell phone. No, she went out this morning. I don't know where she went. No, Skip took her. A while ago. Yeah, I'll tell her. - Michael, come right in. - How you doin', sir? - Good to see you. Take a seat. Look, I just wanted to touch base and run something by you. I haven't talked to you lately. You've been a little distracted. - I'm sorry, I was, uh, it's not important. I'm back with you now. - Great, great. So, uh, we've been starting some research on some available properties for transformational development, first one in the area. - I did my master's thesis on transformationals. - I'm aware of that. That's why I wanted you on this from the ground floor up. See, I need your knowledge on how these projects have worked in the past and also your research and computer skills as far as crunching the data and finding the best property for it. So, sound like something you'd be interested in? - Absolutely. I'm your man, I'll get started today. - Perfect. Okay, great. See, thing is, though, we're a little rushed, so if you could put something together, have it ready for us early next week. - I'll do my best. - Excellent. Thank you so much. You're my guy. - These heifers I'm about to show you are gonna save us. - Oh, yeah, how's that? - Well, Mom started arguing with Dad about a year ago about selling out. Says she can't pay the bills anymore. Dad can hardly stand to talk about it because the farm has been in the family for so long, so we made an investment in artificial insemination from the best bulls. When these heifers calf, they should raise the herd from 30,000 to 35,000 pounds easy. And raise butter fat from 3.5 to 3.9%. - Yeah, I've seen it happen. - These heifers are beautiful, too. The vet should be here any minute to vaccinate them. What the hell? - Frank? Frank, what's the matter with them? - How the hell should I know? - Almost looks like they've been poisoned. - Poisoned. - Here comes the vet. Thank God I called her today. - What's happened here? - I don't know. We were just coming out to look 'em over and wait for you. They were fine yesterday, they were fine. - Take it easy, Frank. I'm going to have to put her down and get inside. - Why. It's obvious they've got a hold of something toxic. Have you changed feeds lately? - No, they've been eating the same hay and say grain since they've been out here. - Jodi, can you walk the field to see if there's anything unusual? - Sure. - I'll come with you. - I don't get it. I can't lose these heifers. - This will cause death almost before I pull the needle out. - Are you sure you have to do that? - I've got to examine the stomach contents if you want me to try and save any of them. - Frank! Frank! - What the hell? - I found these. They were thrown over the fence at the far gate by the road. There's a whole pile of them scattered about like the cows have been into them. - Yew bushes, poisonous to cattle. I'm sorry, Frank. I can only help the ones that aren't too far gone. - How did they get out here? - I don't know. - I bet I know how they got there. It's the four-wheelers getting revenge. And your ex-boyfriend. I bet he's pretty pissed off at you, ain't he? - No, no, he wouldn't do this. - Wouldn't he? I bet your ass I can prove it to you. - Willie! - That's the end of it. - I'll get started examining the others. I can't promise anything. - There you are. - Dad said you're pretty much running the company now. - Uh, yeah, not exactly. - What do you do there? - Marketing research. So I tell companies where to build, where they can find land dirt cheap and they can make millions on it. - How much do you make? - It's none of your business. - Well, I mean, at least enough to pay for our lunch. - Sure, Danny. - Hey. - Uh-oh, here comes the hillbilly. - Hey, Willie. Is there something I can help you with? - I should have known you'd be here, too, you son of a bitch. - Hey, what's the matter with you, man? - You know what's the matter with me. You probably planned the whole thing. - What the hell are you talking about? - Quit playing stupid. I'm talking about the heifers. - The heifers. - Yeah, the heifers, asshole. The ones you poisoned. The ones laying dead in the field. - You little- - Shut up, Danny. Just, Willie, just tell me what happened. - Just one you planned on. They ate the yew bushes you dumped in the field. - Oh, yeah, that was us. Like we got nothing better to do than to poison some dumb cows. I ain't even never heard of a yew bush before. - I hope you're happy, you son of a bitch. Them heifers ain't even good enough for making into a dead hamburger. - Come on, come on, Willie, not here. - You're disturbing the peace, boy. Get out of my restaurant. I'm gonna call the cops. - I'm going. - Damn right you are. - What a jerk. - Shut up, Danny. I swear, if I find out you guys had anything to do with this. - We didn't Uncle Mike. - You think we would do something like that? I know we wheeled the guys farm, but I'm not into killing dumb animals. - Would you sit down? Sorry. - Yeah, I'm going, in just a couple minutes. I needed some body work done anyway. No! Stop, stop, I just had it fixed. - No, no, no, no, hey, whoa. Whoa, no. Whoa, whoa, hey! Hey, come on, open the door, let's talk. Let's talk, man, come on, just, just open it, come on. Willie. Willie, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Don't make this any worse, man. Come on. Just, hold on. - Back up, back up, back up. Out of the truck. Out of the truck. Turn around real slow, real slow. Hands behind your back, slow, slow, slow. Don't move. All right, let's go. Let's go, come on. Get in the truck. - You're gonna pay for this. You're gonna have more than dead cows to worry about next time. - Shut up. Just shut up, Danny. - I just had it fixed. - It just won't work, Dad. - Why not? - Those heifers were our only chance to pull ourselves out of this hole. Now, we can't even get ourselves out of the debt we got ourselves into when we bred them, much less any of the other bills. - Bob, he's right. When you can't even pay the bills, you gotta make a change. - Change? Change to what? This is all that I have ever done. This farm was handed down in the family to keep in the family and that's where I'm gonna keep it. - But, Dad, times have changed. You just, you can't make a living out of it unless you expand or diversify or something. And when you get a drought like we got two years ago or with the heavy rainfall from last year, or like what just happened, you can't keep going. - Like hell I can't. - With what? When you can't pay the bills or even put food on the table. We used up most of our savings last year just trying to keep ahead. And most men your age are retiring and collecting their pensions. You don't even have a pension. You don't have anything but this place. If we sold to the developers, at least we'd have a chance to live comfortably at our old age. Bob, I'm sorry. - Mom. Look, there's gotta be something we can do. I'll start coming up with a plan. Maybe the ag department at the university can help. - Jodi, you don't know what we're up against. - I'm just saying there's gotta be some different options of things- - That was the cops. Willie's at the police station. We gotta go bail him out. - Oh, God. - Oh, what'd the fool do now? - He went to get even with the four-wheelers. - Oh, that dummy. Well, at least he's a loyal dummy, let's go. - Mom, don't cry. It's gonna be okay, I promise. - How you guys doing? What seems to be the problem, sir? - What are you doing with those yew bushes, boy? - Yew bushes? Oh, those are yew bushes? - That's right. - Oh, wife and I just moved into a new place up there at, you know, Creekside Farm Estates. - Farm estates? - Right, right, we're just clearing out the property and just was gonna dump 'em over here in the pasture. Those cows seem to really love 'em. - Don't throw anymore out there. - Oh, yeah, sure, I don't wanna cause any trouble. - Those bushes aren't good for cattle. - Oh, I am so sorry. I didn't know, I had no idea. Like, really, I won't dump 'em there anymore. I'll find someplace else. - You do that. Come on, Frank. - Have a nice day, guys. - Come on. - Is that all you're gonna say to him? Is that all you're gonna do? We should sue him or something. - Sometimes you just gotta forgive 'em son. He did not know what he was doing. - But those heifers. - You gotta let it go. There ain't nothing you can do about those heifers now. Sometimes you just gotta forget about it and go on. Sometimes you just gotta go on. - All right, so this new program I developed, some made several variables to help us making building decisions based on age demographics, income levels, current population, even traffic patterns. Now, the program has taken the information I fed it and has come up with the most feasible location for the building site of this transformational development. I saved the results to present to you, Mr. Poole. I haven't even had a chance yet to take a look at it. - Oh, that's fine. We didn't give you a whole lot of time. Let's have it. - Here goes. - Oh, yeah, there's Lindon Hill Road and that's where it intersects with Limestone. Yeah, I know that area. There's a lot of development going on there. - Wait. - Michael, what is it? - Isn't that, uh? - Yeah, it's farmland. We'll probably get it dirt cheap. Then we'll have to rezone, build by spring. It's the perfect spot, perfect. - But what if they farmer won't sell? - They'll sell, don't worry about that. - You know there's other variables I should put in. This may not be the best place for us to build. This is only the first time I've done it. - I'm satisfied. Great job, Michael. I think this might be worth another promotion. I think it's cause for a celebration. In fact, I have a lunch meeting with someone that I would love for you to meet. Are you free? - Yes, sir. - Excellent. Gentlemen, that'll be all. - Call me, Jim, son. How many times I gotta tell you that? We're on our way, kid. - Yes, I know the place. That's the Stafford farm. We handle their account. They've been having some trouble lately. - Is that right? - Seems some of their AI heifers got poisoned. They're really behind on their loan. I don't know how they're going to pull out of it. It's the same story with a lot of the other farm loans, pitiful. - I know, I know. It's a shame. I just don't understand how so many farmers borrow so heavily and get into debt they're never gonna get out of. It's like they're never gonna learn. - Well, the bank's learning. We're really picking up on loans to developers as you know. - Well, I hope we haven't let you down now, have we? Uh, about Stafford, exactly how far behind is he? - Far enough. - Far enough to sell out? - No. - What was that, Mike? - Oh, I mean, I meant that it can be difficult to get farmers to sell sometimes. - Well, if they won't sell, then we have to convince them that they're heading for disaster, that they need to pursue another line of work and that we can't support them any longer. - In other words, we'll have to foreclose, right? I mean, it's for their own good. - Is it? - Certainly. Most of the time they're grateful when they change jobs and realize they've been working themselves to death on the farm for nothing. I've seen it happen many times. - Have you? - Now all we gotta do is put it in front of the planning board first. - To which I have just been appointed. - What? Outstanding. Then all we gotta do is bring our presentation to the county council at the end of the month and then we'll bring along the model and present that at the meeting and we'll get the town's people, you know, used to the idea. And I think they're gonna love it. Maybe we should have you do the presentation, Michael. - Well. - Right? Then all we gotta do is get a majority vote and we are in. Just think, Michael, you're responsible, congratulations. I'm telling you, this young man is the cream of the crop. - I'll go see if Diane's ready to go. Michael? What's wrong? You're not nervous about the planning meeting, are you? - This is just the first step. We're just getting the used to the idea. - You don't even have to open your mouth until the presentation at the county council. That's at the end of the month. - Cheer up, man. - No, I'm sorry. I'm just, I've had a lot on my mind. - Okay, you're sure you'll all right then. All right. I'll be back in a few minutes. - Well? - Well, what do you think? - Where's Dad? - He's outside telling Mom. I saw your boyfriend at the bank. - What? - He was sitting in a fancy car outside the bank. - Are you talking about Mike? - That was the last boyfriend you had, wasn't it? - Well, what was he doing there? - I don't know. Maybe he was trying to rob the place or something. - Very funny. Frank. What are we gonna do? - I don't know. I just don't know. - Michael, hey, good to see you. Glad you stopped by. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, how'd the planning meeting go? - It was okay, I guess. - Good, good. - They seemed to really like the plans. - Great. That'll make for an even stronger case at the county council meeting. - Where's Mom? - She and your sister had to go shopping somewhere. But you know, Mike. Here lately, I've been kind of worried about you. You know, I felt like you were just playing around too much, but you've really proven yourself. Jim Poole, he speaks pretty highly of you. - Thanks, Dad. - You know, there comes a time when you realize where your responsibilities lie. You just wake up one day and you realize that you've got to take charge and do what's right. - What'd you say? - I said there comes a time when you have to wake up and realize you gotta take charge and do the right thing. - You're right. You're absolutely right, Dad. See you. - Where you going? - I just got something I need to tell somebody. - Okay. Bye. - Jodi. It's getting late. - No, I know. I have two more pages to finish on this lesson plan. School will be starting back before I know it. All right, I'm going up. Don't forget to turn the lights out. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Skip. - Hi, Jodi. Well, can I come in? - Yeah, sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I thought you were going back to North Carolina this month. - Well, I don't have to be back till the end of the week. So I thought I'd stop by and say hello before I leave for good. - Well, how's the speaker circuit going? - Really well. But, it gets kind of lonely. Here, have a seat. - Oh, no, thanks, I'd rather stand. Been in the car all day. - Would you like some iced tea? I just made some. - That'd be great. Thank you. - You know, everybody just went to bed. Why don't I wake them up. I know they'd like to see you. - No, no, no, no, don't wake them up. Uh, lesson plans? - Yeah, I, uh, curriculum changed again, so having to adapt. - How's that going? - It's okay. I get tired. My neck gets so stiff. I don't know how people sit and work at a computer all day. - Stiff neck, huh? - Yeah. - Well, I've always been pretty good at getting cramps out. I learned the technique when I played football, here let me help you. - No, that's okay. - Come on, you'll feel better, I guarantee it. - You know, Jodi, I really only came back here to see you. - You did? - Sure did. I've been thinking about you ever since I left, after the heifer's died. - Oh, come on, I bet you have girls hanging all over you on the road. - Well, sure. But my mind kept coming back to you. - What are you doing? - It's okay. - No, no, no, it's not okay and my parents are right upstairs. - They won't hear us, come on, Jodi. - Cut it out. - What the hell's the matter with you? - Get the hell out of here before I have to use it. - Okay. I'm sorry, just put the gun down. I'm going. - Now before I wake my Daddy and he won't hesitate. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen. That doesn't even sound right. - What do you mean you changed your mind? I thought we had a deal? You know I need your vote on this. Are you crazy? I offered you $50,000. What are you doing to me? Did you suddenly grow a conscience? I got this through the planning commission, but I need you to get it through the hicks on the county council. I'll talk to you later. - May I have your attention please. At the top of the agenda tonight, we have a special presentation. I think we'll all be interested in hearing it. Here's Mr. Jim Poole of Poole & Associates Real Estate to tell us all about it. - Thank you Mr. O'Neil. It's wonderful to see such a large turnout for tonight's presentation. My colleagues and I are happy to share with your our most ambitious project to date, a project that I'm sure you'll agree will benefit the area many, many ways. To present this project to you, is our own Michael Jared, who has been instrumental in developing ideas and also choosing the location for the project. Without further ado, Michael, you have the floor. - Thank you, Mr. Poole. And as Mr. Poole said, this project he's speaking of would be of great benefit to the people of this county. Marking studies show that this project will benefit the community by creating fresh housing and retail along with job opportunities to elevate the economy and we spent many long hours with community studies and computer programs in order to facilitate the best way in order to put this plan into action. - What are you talking about? - What is it? - Where is going to be? - Please, just let me finish. This, this project will involve all of you. The planning commission has reviewed it and they're in favor, so this transformation development is a new concept in real estate. This is a multi-use project, so residential, single-family homes, condos, senior living apartment, as well as retail commercial and light industrial uses are included to create a lively work and play community aspect. And it will take place on over 288 acres. - Where's it going to be? - Yeah, where? - Where's it gonna be? - Quit stalling. - Yeah, come on. Come on, hurry up. - Computer studies show that the most logical, practical, accessible and economic location for this development would be right here where Limestone and Lindon Hill Road meet. - Hey, that's the Stafford place. - So that's why they're foreclosing on them. - To make room for this? No. - Please let me finish. This is gonna benefit the entire area, okay. This is a department store, that's a full service automotive center. There's a bistro, there's a cafe. I mean, can't you just imagine the beautifully landscaped development on this piece of farmland? The playgrounds and the restaurants? It's gonna be a great place to live. This is ridiculous. - Come on. - Well. - Jared. Michael sit down. I'll finish the presentation. - Let him talk. - Okay. - I thought this was a good idea. You know, houses, progress, stores, jobs for people, it all sounds great. It does and maybe it would be, but, I mean, you could always use a new store, a housing development, road, skyscraper, we could use all those things, but the problem is you forget. You forget what you have to give up to get what you think you want. Sure, we want this development, but we need the farm. Even if it is only to look at when you drive by. See the cows grazing in the field, the combines harvesting the wheat. We need it to remind us where we came from. And the Stafford family needs their farm like their ancestors did, to live and to work on. Sure, we could build this development, but maybe we should save the farm instead. I worked hard on this project, but not as hard as I worked on that farm. And I'm asking the county council tonight to vote against this project in accordance with the American Farmland Trust. Sorry about the model, Mr. Poole. - Wait. You could talk all you want, but it won't make any difference. Damn county council don't care what they build on. Next thing you know, there won't be any farmland left. - Yeah, there's nothing you can do about it. They'll foreclose, it'll go through. - It always does. - Let me address this. - Yes, sir, you are right, this will go through 'cause it's the best thing for the area. And for the Stafford farm, it's the best thing for you to foreclose and you will find that out in the long run. - You son of a- - Daddy. - Wait, wait. I don't think anyone's foreclosing on anyone. - What? - I hoped I wouldn't have to do this. - I thought we had deal. You know I need your vote on this. Are you crazy? I offered you $50,000. What are you doing to me? I got this through the planning commission, but I need you to get it through the hicks on the county council. Let go of me. You cretin, let go, I'll sue. Let go. I'll sue. - Everybody calm down now, everybody calm down now. Settle down. Settle down now. Everything is under control. Mr. Poole. - Thank you. - I think you just better come with me. - You can't do this. I didn't do any-, what, I didn't to anything, what are you doing? The whole thing's a lie. That tape is fixed. Michael Jared, you'll never work in real estate again. - No problem. - Proud of you. It's prejudicious, it's amateur. - Oh, thanks. Hey. - Mike, proud of you, great job. - What the? - Whoo! Where's it at. - Thank you. - No, don't thank me. I'm the one who should thank you. I'm, I'm sorry I ever left. - Me, too. - But what about, um... - About what? - Skip. - Skip? - Yeah, I thought you and he- - That jerk's not worth scraping my boot on. - I was hoping you'd say that. - Hey, boy, looks like your ride left without you. - Yes, sir. - Well, get in. Come on over to our place. I wanna talk to you. - Yes, sir, I'd like to talk to you, too, sir. It's just, sir, I have some ideas that I would really like to, uh, tell you about. - I bet you do. I guess we're gonna need all the help we can get.
