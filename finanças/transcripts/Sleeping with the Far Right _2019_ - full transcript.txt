I'm off to the seaside, not for a holiday, it's more a journey into the unknown. My name is Alice Levine. Really dislike, have got a lot of attention... VOICEOVER: I'm a broadcaster on radio and TV. I love living in London and like many of my generation, I embrace diversity and tolerance. CHANTING But all over the world, far-right fringe groups are gaining power. And I'm concerned it could happen here. Britain first! Fighting back! I want to understand what drives people to extremism. So, I'm going to spend a week living with British far-right activist, Jack Sen. One of the reasons people like us target Muslims, is because you can get away with it. Jack is so far-right that when he stood for election as a Ukip MP, the party expelled him for an anti-Semitic tweet. I'm sorry about it, we've suspended him. Then, he joined the far right BNP, but they soon suspended him, too. He's definitely going to say stuff that turns my stomach, I think. But, if I just go in all guns blazing, half an hour into staying with him I just don't think that we're going to get anywhere. So, I would rather talk to him about it and let's try and go a step further than that. Seven days is a really long time as well. A really long time. I'm 200 miles from my home in London in the seaside town of Southport near Liverpool, about to meet Jack Sen and his family. That's Funland - this is it. Ooh, I'm nervous now! Hello. Hi, how are you? Hi, good - I'm Alice. Hi Alice, Jack. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Jack. How are you doing? Hi, I'm Alice. I'm a bit shy. Shy. You a bit shy? Oh, nice to meet you. Alice, hello. My name is Alex! You're not that shy, then! That was a really good introduction. Say hello Alex - wave. Hi. Hi! This is Southport. This is Southport, this is the big tour. It is, yeah, this is kind of the iconic Funland. You know, I travelled the world and came back to Southport because of the feeling of the place, the fact that it's remained relatively as it was even 20-30 years ago. Yeah. It's not change the way some other places have changed. I'll be honest, you don't sound like I imagined you to sound. Yes, quite interesting. I was born in Britain, but raised in the United States from the age of seven through about 20. One of the reasons I came back is I didn't like the United States. I didn't like the multicultural aspect of the US. I mean, I'm not fully British, obviously. My father is actually half Indian. I just felt that... Your father's half Indian? Yeah, yeah. A lot of people don't know that, yeah. Jack's not quite the British nationalist I expected. How did someone of Indian heritage who wasn't raised here end up in the British National Party? Look, I was embraced by people in the BNP. I'm not fully British. What does it say about them? That they like a cultural melting pot? I don't think so - I think they recognised that I was a good guy and that I spoke from the heart and in some way, I could help them sell their message. Since leaving the BNP, Jack's been running his operations from home. This quiet suburb is where I'll be staying for the next seven days with Jack, his wife, daughter and mother, Faye. Hello. I'm Alice. Nice to meet you. It's so nice to meet you, thank you for having us. You are very welcome. What a lovely place and a lovely garden. I'm so sorry we descended on you for a whole week. That's OK, it's exciting, you know... Are you excited for it? Well, of course because I'm into politics cos of my son, obviously. And he tells me lots of stuff and I learn a lot. Cos I grew up in a traditional Britain. Villagers that used to be kind of unspoilt and with a little post office and you know? See, I'm very sentimental and traditional and so obviously those things that vanish really bother me. And I think that we don't have anybody in our country who is actually fighting for us the people, and that's why I just wish we had a Donald Trump, but we don't - I love him. Do you really, you wish there was a kind of Donald character? He's my hero. Yes, because he said, "I want to make America great again." And the list of those things that he's done in the time he's been in office is absolutely amazing. I get it all on Fox. This is all facts, this is not made up stuff - it's not fake news. Absolutely not, because I wouldn't like fake news either. He's my hero. So, who do you think is our best hope for a Trump-like leader here? My son. No! Yeah... Enjoy! Living with a far-right family, I'll have to put on my best poker face this week no matter how strange things get. Because we're in these kind of political situations, I kind of have things alarmed after a certain time at night. OK. So, we don't really want you to go out anywhere after a certain time, is that OK? Oh, I love a night in, Faye. That is right up my street. I wasn't planning on going to the disco, so that's fine. Seven o'clock-ish, something like that. Seven o'clock for the alarms on? Yes. Yeah, it's because I ran for office. We've had a lot of threats. Yeah, my hustings was threatened with bombing when I spoke... When I was due to speak at the Lancashire hustings. We've had police coming constantly for threats, unfortunately. A of threats. The security lockdown is unnerving. But I try to settle in. OK, so, this is the room we do all our events in, so we have a lot of seating here. Nice big room. Yeah, it's a big room. So, I can keep down here, can I? Yeah. Fantastic. And... Yeah, these have fitted sheets. New soaps... Oh, brilliant! ..new sheets. Nice high-quality for the price. You're the best, thank you very much. Yeah, I want to make it comfortable for you. Wonderful. My only concern is, is there anywhere for me to do pull-ups? Oh wait, it's here. Oh, yeah. HE LAUGHS There you go. Thank God, cos I really have to do my pull-ups every day - that's, like, non-negotiable. I do everyday, so... OK, yeah. That's really good, great. Good. Oh, my God, you... Oh, my God, you're a fitness freak! Yeah. It's easy for me, cos I've been doing it for... I'm impressed. Something did crack, though. What do you think that was? Old age. We're not allowed out after the seven o'clock curfew, so I fill the hours before bedtime by finding out more about Jack. I would've liked to run for Mayor of London against Sadiq Khan. Although the person who ran as the BNP's candidate is a decent guy, I don't think he had the ability to kind of make a real impact. I think I could have made a real impact. He actually tried his best to look not racist. Whereas, I wouldn't do that. I would point out... ..you know, the problems with Sadiq Khan and black-on-black crime and this, that, and the other. You know, when you look at the London murders, half of them are on CCTV. You can see the guy walk down the street and it's a black guy. You bring in these people for free labour, you know, you suffer the consequences of having them for eternity, basically. It's a curse, I really believe that. I genuinely believe that - I don't want to live in a society where there are that many black people. And I think that a decent person and someone who's involved in politics wouldn't want that on their streets. I've only been here for a few hours but already the extent of Jack's intolerance is pretty clear. Mass immigration should stop, whether it's from Iraq or Senegal or Poland - doesn't matter. It should stop. And then you can at least kind of, you know... ..sit down and formulate some sort of policy. The demographics have changed to such an extent, it's going to be hard now to stop it. Turn back the clock. Yeah, it's going to be next to impossible. Like, London's gone. Birmingham's gone... There's no way to take it back. I just want to ask you if you would like a cup of tea. Oh, I would love a cup of tea. I'm sure you would, yes. I came before but I didn't want to interrupt because it always looks so busy. Thanks, Faye. I'm going to get some rest now. We have a long day tomorrow. Sleep tight. Thank you very much. Thanks, Jack. Have a good night, take care, bye-bye - oh, jeez! Too low, yeah! WHISPERS: It is a bit like the weirdest school exchange ever. He said some absolutely ludicrous things about black people. I mean, his general policies on life are troubling. I'd say 11 on the troubling scale and it's a 1-5 scale, so... I think it's a bulletproof vest. It was behind one of the living room chairs. Why would he need this? Has he left this here for me? Is it like when you leave someone towels on the end of the bed? "There are your towels, there's some soap. "There is a bulletproof vest." I'm spending a week living with far right extremist Jack Sen and his family. Some juice, if you want, some smoothie? Oh, lovely, that sounds great. You've got your red wine in the fridge. We use that for cooking. It's there for up to ten days, two weeks. And what would you usually have for breakfast? A granola bar and some milk. That's it? That's it, yeah. To stay thin. Have you always been trim? Yes. I played a lot of sports as a kid, so it was always really important for me. I'm not the biggest person in the world, I'm only 5'8, 13 and a half stone, so in order for me to keep up with men who are bigger than I am in sports, I had to always keep strong. So I pride myself in remaining strong to this day. Like, even going out with other friends, nationalist arm wrestling, I pride myself on beating them and they're three times bigger than me, sort of thing. I think it's important, I really think a man should stay in shape. Western culture's just disgusting and hedonistic. So people say you're fighting to preserve Western culture, no, I'm not, I'm fighting to bring back Western culture. I don't want to preserve what's here now. I think what's here now is disgusting, really. What was prime? What was a prime year? 1937. 37? What was going on in '37 that you loved? If you look at the old nationalist movements, the sort of men that led the movements were all physically fit, strong, athletic, intelligent, and you look what's happened today, what they look like, how they act and it's just... To keep in peak condition, just like his heroes, the right wing leaders of the 1930s, Jack works out daily, alongside his wife and daughter. Your legs are still going down. It's because they're not strong, they're buckling. You do how many of these? I can do 50. Oh, my God! After the morning exercise regime, Jack gets down to work. Since leaving mainstream politics three years ago, Jack has set up over 25 websites and numerous Facebook pages to promote his far right beliefs. The far right should be talking about all the issues that we believe needs repair before we move forward. Jack tells me that these campaigns are privately funded by his supporters. Let's go on to the Facebook and we can take a little look see. What's Lone Volchok? Oh, you told me. Yeah, it means lone wolf in Russian. Are you a lone wolf? Actually, I chose that name about ten years ago. I used to be fascinated by wolves, actually. This is the beauty of Facebook. I published this one. When Winnie Mandela died, instead of me saying she's a monster, I just created a post saying Mandela's wife, Winnie, was a zealous and open applicant for one of the most brutal murder tactics ever conceived by man, as many blacks were murdered by Winnie and her anti-terrorist partners. And I'm using that intentionally to demonstrate that she victimised blacks as well, because then liberals will see that, or moderates will see it and think, "Oh, she didn't just kill the evil white man, "she also killed her black brothers," and that will get them thinking a little bit. And it will make your reach wider. Of course it well. A lot of liberals will see it and think, "She killed blacks?" "So why is the left canonising her? It's simple, "Because they too are consumed with hatred. "Warmest regards, Jack Sen." Warmest regards! Of course, I'm messaging my supporters. It's a letter to my people. "Warmest regards" is really funny. Why is it funny? It's warmth, it shows warmth. It does show warmth. So, uncover it. It's dangerous, you might, your hand might catch on fire. Because it's violent and graphic content. Just be careful. So she was... You know what necklacing means, right? yeah, I do. She put a tie around the man's neck, put petrol in it and burned him to the ground while alive. That's why they didn't take it down, because it's not fake news. That's a really extreme image, isn't it? I've never had my Facebook account taken down. Everybody else I know has, like me. I've never had any of my channels taken down. Why? I know how to play the game. I know what to say and what not to say. I understand, because I've been on the phone with them many times to find out what I can do and cannot do. It was seen by 58,000 people. Do you think fringe politicians use shock tactics more than the mainstream? We have to. You have to? We have no choice, shock and awe as the Americans would say. Shock and awe, baby. Jack has lots of targets. Among them, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, homosexuals, feminists, liberals and left-wingers. His views are offensive. But I want to find out more about who Jack was before he got involved in politics. I was a musical major, originally at university. A singer, believe it or not. And I was in musical theatre when I was younger. Most of the men were homosexual and they were unbearable to work with. Why were they unbearable to work with? Well, very crass. Always off key? Always off key, always sexual, by the way. Extremely sexual. Like, talk about sex acts, talk about body parts. They felt they could get away with it. One of the guys I worked with... Frat boys talking about... Have you been in a frat? I was in a frat. They don't. But you know that happens. They don't, I was in a frat. Are you telling me that boys don't talk about their sexual escapades in frat houses? No. They don't talk about details, no. No, never. I've never heard any discussion like that. Absolutely not. This one guy I worked with once, he drew a picture of his you-know-what on the chalkboard, for fun. I've never seen that, any straight man do anything like that before. Never. They think they can get away with it, just like the Muslim grooming gangs thought they can get away with it. Why did they think they can get away with it? Because... Their beautiful voices and making rhythm. No. Because they know you can't really challenge them. Because you'll be called homophobic. So do you think you would still be in musical theatre now if the make-up of that group had been different? Perhaps, yeah. I really enjoyed it. I left all of the music behind me when I was 18. So I don't see this as left or right, I see this as good versus evil. Things are moving at the end of the day. So what are you guys pushing? The truth, decency, righteousness. We want to rebuild the country, stop the killing, close the borders. Jack's online campaigns often feature his wife and daughter promoting traditional family values. Jack's wife, Natasha, is from a Ukrainian family, so I'm curious about what she makes of British nationalism. What did you think? You saw him from afar, his lovely curly hair blowing in the wind... OK, this is really funny but I thought he looks like Keanu Reeves and he is one of my favourite actors and I was like, "Oh! Tell me more about this guy." Did you realise quite quickly that your ideologies were similar? Well, I suppose I grew up in a place without any minorities, so for me to see a minority was a novelty. So why Britain, because you are a very international family in a lot of ways. Why is Britain home? I think it's mostly because in Southport, 86% born British people. Full-on estimate, all the crimes... SHE MUMBLES ..and when black people start moving into the city, if the amount of them becomes more than 16%, the city becomes a ghetto. Shootings, stabbings, rapes... Is it a thing you worry about? Yes, when you have a daughter, when you have a girl. I don't know, do you live in London? I do. How do you live there? Aren't you scared to walk home? I don't actually feel scared. So you have never experienced anybody jumping on you? I actually haven't. Luckily I actually haven't, but I understand that there's a risk. I agree, there's definitely a risk. But there's a risk here too of bad things happening, right? In Southport, no. But white men commit the majority of rapes. White man? Are they born in Britain or are they Lithuanians, Polish? White men. I don't believe you. You don't believe me? What about those Muslims. Are they white? They're not committing the majority of rapes. Yes, they are, they are grooming. Alice! Yes, Alex, yes? I don't know how to whistle. You don't know how to whistle? Like this... You're kind of doing it. Oh, you can whistle. Jack cannot whistle. He can't whistle? That's going to be his downfall. All the great leaders have to whistle! One little thing... We will practise. I find it depressing that Natasha is fearful of every non-white face she sees. Living with Jack and his family is so far removed from my own experience of living in Britain. But, at least Jack and I have one thing in common. A love of cooking. I'd like to know how to make a really good Italian sauce. OK, we can do that. So, whenever you have the garlic and then I'll throw in some ground pork. Lovely. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Can we start? Great. Mm. So good. Jack, he said to me he wants me to read one of my poems out to everyone. I said I'd love to. I have a lovely one about England that's really good. Yeah. I'd love to hear that. Tonight, we're sitting down for dinner with Jack's mum, Fay, a self published poet who is also fluent in several European languages. I'm going to have to excuse myself, I'm sorry, because I have to go. Why? I have to. Why? Are you on the phone or something? Yes, I have to. She's on the phone. With the French guy? Probably, yeah. Talking French. So, how does she know the French guy? I have no idea. I think it was... Believe it or not, from some Front National group. Really? Yeah. Is it a romantic... I don't know, I don't get involved. OK, it's your mum. Like she wouldn't ask me what my love life with my wife, so I won't ask. That is a good point. SPEECH IN FRENCH I mean, when I was running for Parliament, I remember I used to interview myself on different websites. I would pretend to be an interviewer, interview myself. Did you really? Yeah. What, under another name? Yeah. So I would write the questions and write the answers, basically. Oh, my God! And then I would leak these stories to the Daily Mail and papers and they would ring me right away. "Did you really answer this?" I actually wrote the questions and wrote the answers. Yeah. There's a lot of tricks. There are. Yeah, a lot of tricks. I can't go through all of them. There are just too many and some of them are really underhanded, basically. Manipulating the mainstream media. You're a puppeteer? Yeah. Just two days into my stay and I'm starting to get a picture of the dark arts Jack employs to get his message out. But perhaps most alarming is how Jack targets people who publicly disagree with him by posting videos and articles to discredit them. What we try to do also, is, when we target someone, well, we don't target people on the right, obviously, but we make sure if you Google them, it comes up first. But you did that, you pushed... I have Russian web admins who do that for me. Who push up on the SEO and you'd give them a specific bit of content like this and say, I want that number two. I pay them. And is it expensive? No. I can put my article about you at the top. I could write anything I wanted to. That's incredible. Yeah. We've done it many times to many people. You can destroy someone who is damaging your work. You can destroy someone's career by doing that? If it's necessary, that's what why the Daily Mirror targeted me because we did it to one of their reporters. We hammered her. She basically attacked me relentlessly in the press, so I basically had my guys take the article that was written and drive it home at the top. That has blown my mind, that you could create the whole first page of Google about somebody, could be content you had curated, because you could be really vicious with that. You have the toolkit to be. Of course, yeah. That scares me, because would you do that to me? No, I wouldn't. If you intentionally tried to harm me, anything's possible, I suppose. But I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. Thank you so much for dinner. You're very welcome. Oh, my God. WHISPERS: I feel being in this house doesn't help me get much perspective on whether it's smoke and mirrors or not. But it makes me feel weird, because I feel like if I make a film that he doesn't like, he could cut some stuff together to make things look... ..not as they occurred. But I guess that's part of the risk of doing it in the first place. and his family, to try and understand where his extreme beliefs come from. There's the biggest run of houses near to the schools, yes? SHE SPEAKS HER OWN LANGUAGE # If you turn me down once more # I'll join the French Foreign Legion # Maybe they would welcome me with open arms # First you love me, yes # Then you love me, no I don't know where I stand # Do we march together down the aisle...# SHE SPEAKS FRENCH # It's the French Foreign Legion # For me... # One, two, three, four... Are you OK if I jump in the shower? Sure, of course. Yeah, yeah. Fine. Today, Jack's taking me into Southport town centre. Faye, we're going to head, then. You've got the place to yourselves. Go wild, Faye. Oh, I will. I'll dance and I'll sing, too. All right, you shortly. See you, later. Bye-bye. As well as his online campaigning, Jack meets regularly with other far-right activists, to discuss their common cause. You know, this is not that peculiar for our sorts of meetings. I mean, people think that it's, kind of, like, people huddled around a table wearing robes in the dark. It's just a lot of good humour, good fun and political conversation. Is it treated like a meeting? Do you have, like, an agenda where there's stuff that you need to cover? We talk politics. Like, Carl and I will discuss the activities he's going to engage in, the operations down south. And we'll talk about the radio show he is going to be producing in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, exactly. What were you going to say? We are not racists, like they call us, cos Jack's foreign, if you like. We don't call...can I say it on camera? Yeah. We don't call black people, we don't call them niggers or chinks. We don't talk like that. Do you get a label? Do you get labelled? Well, of course you get labelled. But the fact is, that there's no debate about it. Their answer to that is to call you names, disgusting names, actually. Shout you down, break your windows, damage your car and whatever it is that they will do. So, there's no dialogue. I came at this, I was a paid-up member of the Labour Party in the 1990s. And I was a union rep, a trade union rep, as well. In this country, Muslims, homosexuals, different ethnic minorities are used as a weapon to take our freedoms from us. There's a feeling throughout this country, at the moment, by ordinary people in the streets, especially in working-class communities, there's an electricity. People know there's something wrong. And I believe, because of what Islam is doing within our country, we need to reignite Christianity and bring Christians back into the churches again. I feel like I, kind of, have an overview or an idea of the ideology, but in real terms, how can you make an impact? How can you make a change? The democratic system is rigged against us. So, what do you do? You then resort to, if you like, guerrilla warfare. Things will escalate in the future. And if it really goes the whole hog, there will be violence on the street. What do you mean by guerrilla warfare? Well, we produce placards. We produce leaflets that aren't PC. And then we're going to set up a network, which is set up already, of people to go out and they will plaster these placards in public places, so people can read them and think. Like, we equate the Labour Party with paedophilia. We literally link them, because most people will recognise that the Labour Party promotes and empowers paedophiles. And not just Muslim, but grooming gangs. We are talking about paedophiles across the board. The sheep out there are still oblivious to what's going on. Jack's guerrilla activists deface road signs to publicise bold but unsubstantiated claims. And they hung this notice on a statue of Nelson Mandela in London's Parliament Square. Jack then posted these images online, where they receive hundreds of thousands of views. Right, so this is the sort of thing that we produce. We are trying to make a specific point here. So, our flags are, that's a... Gay pride flag. The rainbow, yep. And the Islamic flag. So, you put those up with your guys, or they go and put them up. They put them up. And then what would happen with these? With leaflets, if someone doesn't want to go out and put something out at night, they can go down to a high street or somewhere and just hand out a leaflet. We don't force them on people. People are quite receptive to this? Some are, some aren't. We're not out to recruit people. We're just showing them what's happened. A lot of people don't know... Well, it would be good to recruit people, though, surely? No, we're really not... We're not looking to recruit people. No, but you said you need more people in the network. We don't want to become like the Tory Party or the Labour Party, cos then it's a nightmare to run. I wonder if you'd...which would be more powerful, you receiving this leaflet or you know how you said, when you weren't getting jobs because you're white and British... Yep. ..do you feel like that was a more energising force, because you lived it? Yeah, to me. OK. Being discriminated against for jobs, in my own country. And having my dad with me, as well. And someone says, "Sorry, you can't have a job, "we only employ East Europeans" That's why I got involved. That was a life-changing moment? That was it, yep. SHE WHISPERS: It would be fine if you went to the pub with them and just talked about football and talked about life and weather. They all feel that they've been the victims of an unfair system. I can sympathise to a certain extent with the feeling, but at what point do you go, "I didn't get a job because I was discriminated against," and let that take over your whole life? One, two, three. Higher, higher. This is good. Don't hurt me! Put your legs over. Ready? 17, 18, 19. Higher, yep, and try to make it tight, like you're resisting it. Oh, yeah. OK. You feel it? 45. 50. Oh, God! It's done. That's me. Jack's background is so different from his British nationalist friends that I want to find out more about his upbringing. Yeah, I talked to you about poetry earlier in the week. Yeah. I would love you to read me some. I also, kind of, want to know about, like, Jack as a little boy and what do you remember of Jack when he was ten? Well, I can, my best memories of him probably, and I have a picture of him when he was five, at school. He was a very sweet little boy. He was always very bright, too talkative, of course. Yeah. Very, very smart in school. He loves to chat. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Jack's father was of Indian and South African heritage. He moved the family to America when Jack was seven. What was it like being in a mixed-race couple in the 1970s? In America, we had a difficult time, because it was a Jewish school district and they were not very accepting of us. My son, in school, he got into lots of fights, because he was quite smallish in height. And one day in the school, I happen to come into the music teacher's class and my son was on the floor. And there was this boy on top of him. Oh, God. And he was, like, three times the size of my son. That's probably why he did his lifting of his weights, because he wanted to be able to defend himself against these creatures who didn't like him, you know. Some lines of that in my poem. I was going to ask, actually. We must talk poetry. This is your lovely book, Life's Adventures In Classical Rhyme. Right. Faye Lowley. I love this one, but, obviously, partly because we're talking about Jack, would you mind reading this one? Well, I presume it's about Jack, it might not be. It probably is. There is one about dedication to a loved one. What courage you have, beloved of mine. I cannot forget how much we've endured. But now we've overcome. Let's drink the wine. The time has come to savour our reward. My love for you has hopefully instilled some faith and burning, longing to succeed. On the right path your goals will be fulfilled. I'll not forsake you in your time of need. Go forth and write. Show them with all your might, your courage and what lies within your heart. Another great one. Thank you. If somebody wrote that about me, I'd be very, very happy. Like any proud mother, Faye seizes the opportunity to show me some childhood photos. Oh, my gosh! Show me. Oh, what a cutie, I can already tell. What's "Dilip at school"? Or "De-lip at school"? Well, that's, I guess, the name we gave him. Oh, that's the name you gave him? Yes, sure, yeah. Oh, so Jack Sen's his, kind of, political name? Yeah. Well, you see, what he's decided, and I think this is a very good thing that he said, "I don't think they'll accept me, if they see my name like that." But when was that, when did he change it? 2015? Was that the election? So, what was his name before? Dilip. Dilip Sengupta. It's an Indian name, obviously. I chose it because it sounded like Philip, you know. I want to hear from Jack why he felt he had to change his name. Your mum mentioned your name, your previous name, Dilip Sengupta, and I wondered if you could talk to me a little bit about that. I don't want to have that in the film, can we avoid having that? Cos I changed that for legal reasons. Can we not have that in the film? I don't know why my mother even mentioned that, she should not have done that. Cos that's been legally changed, that was for a, kind of, important reason. The combination of names would be more identifiable as Indian. I don't know why, she should not have mentioned that. I mean, I am furious at her, because that, kind of, ruins the whole thing for me. She was actually... I know she was, but she should know better, it's just ridiculous. I don't want that in the film. Why would it ruin things for you? Because I don't want it in the film. I'm finished, finished. And this is actually finished now, because I'm telling you, it's not fucking relevant. Either she's a poor interviewer... I'm not, I'm not... ..cos it's not relevant. I'm here, you can talk to me. One uses elements of their person. As tools to sell the message, I get that. Yeah, that's it. So, why am I not selling that? Because it's irrelevant to the message. What shaped my identity and what shaped my political beliefs is the fact that when I lived in multicultural America, in a Jewish community, I felt miserable. And everything I did was, it was downgraded. I thought it was something to do with me. Like, perhaps I wasn't doing a good job. And I couldn't get away from it. Whether it was cos I was part Indian, whether it was cos I was half Indian, three-quarters Indian, a quarter this, a quarter that. Whether it was because I had an Indian name, a non-Indian name. Let me finish. Whether it was Jewish or.... No. Whether I was a Gentile or not a Gentile, it was down to the multiethnic community and the fact that the establishment was Jewish. I believe that multiethnic societies are toxic for people who live in them. You keep to your own. And I really don't have an own, this is the problem. I didn't have an own. Here I am, who's my own? What? Who's my own? People in West Lancashire? My mother's Irish friend, because I'm part Irish? That I can see, that bit I see. Like, who did you have, like, who were your group? And I get that, I totally get that. Of course I see the, like the benefits of identifying in a group. But I don't think that that means that you can't be accepting. This is what I'm talking about. That's why I'm against multiculturalism. I believe it's self-defence mechanism. If someone slaps you, and those people in that group are taught to hate you and slap you, you have the right to be fearful of them. And that's what shaped me. Alice. Alice. Sorry about waking you up in the morning to do the exercise. I haven't exercised yet. Oh, yeah. Right. And you got me in a towel, which was not intentional, it was totally inadvertent, cos, like, literally I just washed up and I'm dripping, so... Oh, man. Ten years ago, yeah, I intentionally would have had my six-pack on. So, what's...? I did not want to be in a towel, OK, but it's fine. I didn't think you'd like tattoos. What is it? I can't really see from here, what is it, is it a dolphin? No, it's a wolf. I do actually like wolves, the alpha wolf and kind of the whole structure of the pack. You know. I'll let you guys to it. What a way to wake up. Hi, Dr Duke. Hey, Jack, how are you doing? Pretty good, Dr Duke, as usual, good to hear your voice. Jack's day begins with a call to David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. We're not race haters, Jack's not a race hater, I'm not a race hater, I'm a race lover. But we all have a right to preserve our identity. That's in nature, every breed of wolf has that, every breed of bear. If the average moderate person hears what we have to say, the vast majority of them will agree with us. Except for a few Jews and people who are just so prejudiced, can't even open their mind for a second, right? Yeah... OK, I've got to go, I've got some things I've got to do. I enjoyed it, guys, see you later. Bye-bye, David. These are really good, full of vitamins, I have these every day. Hi, Tim, mate. How are you doing? Jack has a routine catch up with Tim Scott, a former British Army soldier. Together they've created a web page, Liberty Defenders. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm interested, Tim - is now a difficult time to be a white working-class man? Yes. Yes, completely. And why is that? We feel oppressed, in jobs that we could have gone into, but we can't necessarily, or we try and we just get knocked back, just because we are not a certain group. I find that that's not freedom, at all. Because of the quota system, Tim is a 100% white fella and he has been subjected to racism. I'm 75% white and I've been subjected to racism. A quick example, I was chatting with a professor about this trip I wanted to take to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This is a 19th-century train they use to kind of escort tourists up to the top of the mountain. And they have actors play kind of cowboys and bandits. But one of the students behind me was black, she started to laugh, started to snicker. I turned around and said, "What's your problem?" She started to call me abusive names, and I told her to eff herself. And she said, "Eff you, white trash," she said. White trash. And I was like... And I called her a ghetto bird in response. You know, and... That's the sort of hatred, racial hatred that they feel towards us. She probably wanted to go to the hip-hop nightclub on vacation. For me, I wanted to see the American West. And for her, that was... Why did she want to go to a hip-hop nightclub? Well, because that's probably what she probably wanted, I'll be honest with you. So she insulted me and then she was... Why? I think it just makes her good-humoured, you know. Don't show off now just because Tim's here. I'm not showing off. You're getting overexcited. You're a bad influence. White male pack mentality. She said white male pack mentality. Would we be allowed to say black male pack mentality? No. Not in mainstream, no. We are not in mainstream, Tim! If I said a pack of black males, I could probably get arrested for that. I said pack mentality. No, we can go back and review it, but I'm pretty sure you said pack of white males. And if I had said when blacks get together, they become aggressive, become hypersexual, criminalistic, if I said a pack of... No, I think you've, I think you've added some meaning to that. When you think of packs, you think of wolves. Could I say packs of feral blacks? Whereas you can say a pack of white males. Do you think that's because there's a connotation about being nationalist, there's a racist connotation, and that being a liberal, there isn't a racist connotation? But there is to nationalists. We see the left wing as racist and hateful, anti-male and anti-heterosexual, anti-white. I see you as a racist. Yeah, I mean, if you come away from a day with Jack Sen and he is calling you racist, you've got to worry about what you're doing. If he said you have said something offensive. Boy, oh, boy! My week with Jack is almost over. So we're getting ready for a publicity photograph. But first, Jack is recording a radio show with Nick Griffin, a former BNP member of the European Parliament and big beast of the British far right. Nick Griffin, Nazi scum! Nick Griffin, Nazi scum! Chicken curry, we've got the recipe, now eff off! Nick Griffin is a regular guest on Jack's internet clips and his radio shows. You're listening to Resistance Radio, with your host, Jack Sen. So, with Resistance Radio, I started the channel a year ago. And Nick, kindly, has basically volunteered his time to help me record programmes. Hi, Nick. Yes, Jack. How are things with you? OK, thank you very much. This is Alice, hello. Hello there. I think my goal in all of this is to demonstrate that it's not OK to be anti-white. Is that a new thing? What's the new thing? The anti-white thing. Well, it's something that's been orchestrated by the far left and the establishment has allowed it to happen. I mean, like when Tim and I were on Skype, and you said pack of white males, I pointed out that that would be considered racist if you'd said pack of any other sort of males. If I said a pack of blacks or a pack of Jews, it would be rightly regarded as being racist, so... Well, Nick, I think... But it's OK when you're doing it to whites? That's precisely what I said to Alice, is that you can't see that it's racist is the problem. The connotations surrounding pack is animals - dogs, wolves, long teeth, fangs, saliva, blood. You've made a lot of inferences there. You've read a lot into what, let's be honest before... What does pack mean? Group, clan, family. No, it doesn't, come on, it's a pejorative aspect of a group. It's a pejorative. It is, a pejorative, you know. You know perfectly well it is, so, you switch off because you're so indoctrinated, you can't see your own bigotry and now you try and cover it up. Nick, hi, you weren't there, so I'd love you to hear the conversation, but just before the phone call connected, we were talking about humour. And it was exceptionally ironic and I know you didn't pick up on the irony, I'm sorry you didn't. I can't, no. But it was a joke, like you've been making jokes. If I had said a pack of black males, would you think it was funny? I'd think it was completely different. How is it different?! Because we've talked about how it's different. It's not different! We've talked about how it's different. And also if you said it with venom, it was also be different, so you've got to take all of these contacts into account. If I'd said to you... Let me finish like I let you finish, because I know you get upset when you don't have the floor, but the thing is, we have to take all of this into account, and I'm really sorry this has got so heated so quickly, because this is just supposed to be a chat, I'm supposed to be learning about you, and if that is what you want to focus on, if that is how you want to use the time, that's fine, but I feel like we've talked about that and I feel like... We don't want to focus on this, I'd actually like to talk about, I already indicated, the dangers of World War III. And you're the one who said you want to talk about this race thing, you want to talk about this pack thing, you're the one who brought this back to that. No, I didn't. Obsessed with race, totally obsessed. You brought it up, I didn't bring it up. Alice, you did. I'm very, very busy all over social media, doing my little bit to try and stop World War III and I haven't got time to talk with idiots about race. Simples. Am I the idiot, sorry? Yeah, absolutely, I'm afraid. You can't help it, it's the way you've been brought up. Well, if you don't have time, we'll just thank you for your time, thank you so much. Just one second. There's a knock at your door. Yeah, I know. Maybe just have a seat over there for a few minutes while we prepare for... Alice. Hiya. I'm so relieved to see the photographer. We've got to go take some photos now, Nick, but thank you so much for your time. Nick, I really thank you, thanks for your patience and thanks for ringing, I do appreciate it. Bye. Bye, Nick, bye-bye. Oh! He called me an idiot! That's not very polite, I really think that's not a great way to get the message across, number one, I don't think that's a great political strategy, but I also don't think that it's... He was an MEP, so he knows politics. He was an MEP, he got elected, you have not and you would never be elected, he has been elected. I think he knows the strategy better than you do. I know broadcasting and I know that it's not a great way to get your message across if you just name-hurl. He's not a broadcaster, he's a politician. What you said was idiotic, at the end of the day. You wanted to bring race into it immediately and then I pointed out... You interrupted me, excuse me. You brought race into it, don't interrupt me. Don't interrupt me. You're not going to steamroll me, no. Can I respond? Are you going to address my point or are you just going to go into a monologue? I mentioned anti-white, perhaps, that's true. However, I'm not going to be lectured by you, I'm sorry, I know a lot more than you do about politics. I know a lot more about life than you do as well. I'm sorry, I do, I mean, just from our conversation, vocabulary wise, I think we both can agree, you said yourself you can never beat me in an argument, that comes down to lots of factors. I could never beat you in a debate, but I think I could conduct a better conversation. I don't think so. You do a better monologue, for sure. You're condescending, I'm not. I'm married and I have a healthy, happy marriage and I have a child. You do not, so don't lecture me on that. You don't know if I do. I've said over and again. Again, condescending. To be honest with you, you're slightly obnoxious as a human being, that's all I'll say, you're obnoxious. I guess I was being... You can't help it, because you're on the left. You're the extremist. I'm sleeping in the same house with an extremist, although you believe you are. Racist. Sexist. Sorry. Well, let's take some photos and then we can wrap this up as quickly as possible. Good, that sounds good. I put on a special blazer for this, come on, let's get this done. Am I overdressed for this, with the blazer, do you think, or not really? Is that what you normally wear? I thought for this we were going to dress up, it's fine. Does that mean I'm underdressed? It's so uncomfortable, isn't it? This is one of the most uncomfortable moments of my life. Oh, give me a break. You must have had a very sheltered existence. Try being spat at by Labour politicians in the central square in Ormskirk and being told that they're going to kill you. You win.
