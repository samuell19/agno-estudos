Well, seeing you get angry I think he must be real, Who is he? I said there's nothing to talk about Anyway, good luck, Don't be too difficult like you are with me Be nice to him I'm surprised Hooking up with boys... It's not like that! Aquarius? Sorry, but you'll have bad luck with boys all month No way I've got 3 blind dates next week Really? You know, I'm an expert on juggling guys Can't I go there instead of you? Why you? I should go Stop fighting What's yours? Let's decide from the sign I'm a Capricorn You go! You've got terrific luck with love Of course! - No way! It's the same sign... - Hey... Can I see the Zodiac too? Lucky color- Orange Lucky icon - Pink heart Wow, your maid is really a fantastic cook! Did you take this picture yourself? Yes, in Hawaii Hawaii? I went there as an assistant making a fashion catalogue Hmm... not bad It must be nice to travel But Hawaii's a little stale Hawaii is "stale"? How about Europe, then? I began to like Hawaii so much after I visited there So I studied about it, and now I am an expert on Hawaii I even studied the Hawaiian language Ohno means delicious Thank you is "mahalo"... You always listen to this song, don't you? Yes, I like it Don't you think the lyrics are a bit too depressing? Really? What do they mean? Well, it's just... Will Neil and Armstrong become big like this turtle one day? Hey, is this brain totally empty? Hello! Anyone here? This is a different species from them Look here! Even where they live This one lives in the sea but... Neil & Armstrong live in a fish bowl You're so ignorant Then is that why you look ugly? Because you're so smart? Now I know why I liked him a lot from the beginning Is your father an alien, too? Before the main shooting I need to get some rough cuts first I'd like to take some pictures here before rehearsal starts Shall we? - Wait a minute please - Yes Would you like to try this on? - Oh, No thanks - It's okay You can try it - Shall we start now? - Sure Now, hold this bar, and try this One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight And move your foot like this One Two Three Four Repeat One Two Three Four Now, shall we try? Why don't you take off your glove? It's slippery Oh, okay, yes, holding the bar Like this... One Two Three Four Five Six Hey! Miss! Are you okay? Mina! Mina! What happened? I don't know Suddenly... Mina! Are you okay? Mina! Look at me! Someone call 911! Mina! Mina... Are you okay now? Where am I? The hospital? No, you're at home Then why is she here? How can you speak so cruelly? I came to see if you're okay Are you going to put me in the hospital? She says you don't need to Don't worry The hospital is all full anyway You wouldn't get in even if you begged This IV is to rehydrate and give you vitamins, Now go to sleep! Misuk, why don't you go and work? Don't stay home because of me Okay You can go now too I'll pull this out after it finishes Yes, let's leave together I'll give you a ride Yun- jung! You think I'm wrong for discharging Mina from hospital like that? No The reason I let Mina stay at home is because I want to live with her even if it was for just one more day Mina... When she was hospitalized again last year she cut her wrists When I got back to her room after admitting her her sheets were all red So... Don't blame me for not doing anything for her Ah, nice You see? Isn't it cool and fresh? - Aren't you cold? - I'm okay I feel much better now I was itching to go out after staying inside all day It seems that you enjoy going out a lot these days? Hey, why don't you stand up and push me? I'm a patient Right, you stay there and I'll push you Weren't you thinking I'd say that? Stop nagging and push me - Is this why you gave birth to me? - Yes How did you feel wearing toe shoes today? It was okay I think ballet isn't as elegant as I thought before It's very hard work That's why I didn't want you to do ballet They say 30% of ballerinas are in chronic pain Okay So don't work too hard And don't skip any of your medicine And if you're feeling a little anaemic Boring, stop it Okay, I'll stop But please keep pushing me No If you push me, I will take you to Europe next month Next month? - What about school? - You can skip it That doesn't sound like what a mother would say How about going to Hawaii instead of Europe? Why? Didn't you want to go to a ballet performance in Europe? There's something I want to see more in Hawaii Really? Then we could go to Hawaii It'd be cheaper anyway You know, I've been thinking about it and... I guess we don't want to go as part of a tour group Of course not That's not our style But it's dangerous for 2 pretty young women to go by themselves Especially as my beauty is so well- known internationally That's right And if it's just us, we can't take pictures of us together Oh, you're right Then maybe we should take someone with us? Yes As a carrier and bodyguard As a photographer and tour guide Can you come with us? - It would be an honor - Not you My pleasure - It's done, now - Thank you You see? I knew it would be great That's because my face is pretty - Now, your turn - Oh, I'm... Why don't you have a seat anyway? Please make it really pretty I am a real genius to think of this Such a great idea It's the first time for you to have a manicure, right? Pedicure, It's for the toes Give me a break Whatever it is, this is the first time for me too Oh, my lighter! I finally got it! Hey, let me use it again to light a cigarette No way Here, I'll light it myself Where did you get that? It's my father's He didn't give it to me actually Misuk was hiding it and I found it Was he in the navy? Yes What kind of man was he? We never talk about him Misuk and I... felt that we would get too sad Hey I think I will feel awkward whenever I go to pee Why? Because you'll always see me Ah! Cold! Too cold! You'll end up an alcoholic if you keep drinking like this I am Okay, okay You seem worried No Why would I be worried when I have such a pretty daughter? My Mina... Will you live well without me? Why? Do you want to marry again? Will you? Worry about yourself I'll be fine Yes, you'll be fine without me Well... do you like the downstairs dude? I don't know! What kind of silly question is that? Tell me I'll help you It's not like that Then what is it? It's just... He's fun to be with and he's nice to me How nice I should thank him Mina... have a great time in Hawaii There's no way I can repay you but I can reward Mina, so I'll do as much as I can for her So you must help me Help our Mina to only have happy times until she goes to you Help me... Kang Mina! Mina! Mina! Hey, Mina! Mina! You... your eyes are puffy? - I drank some beer last night - Alone? You drank alone, too Wow What a nice surprise Oh, right, it'll rain today Hold on, I'll get an umbrella Mina, your umbrella! Hey, excuse me Can you call Mina, please? - That girl? - Yes Something happened in the class? That poor guy is pathetic Losing his love being left alone Being crazy because of love He seems like a happy person Not everyone can have that kind of love And he'll live with his love forever in his heart Mom! Yes? If I lie here like this I can only see the sky I feel like I'm on an airplane You've never taken a plane Do you think I can? We will go to Hawaii soon Right Isn't there a regular customer in this restaurant who likes you? Didn't you know? All the guys who come here, come to see me I mean it, someone who's serious Someone who's nice who you could marry Now, with a little make up you look nice But what will you do after you get old? Children are no use when you get old What? Now you have a boyfriend You don't need mom anymore? It's just... I think you'll be Ionely after I get married and leave... Don't worry I worry If you insist I'll find a nice man soon a rich and kind guy Are you sure you'll call him dad? No way! I even call you Misuk, not "mom" I'll just call his name Hey, Bubba! Like that No! Never! You will call him, Leonardo! What! Nice, the smell of dawn Are you sleepy? Of course I just fell asleep - What? - This... This is a present for a good kid who got up early And... Take these too Why? Don't you like them? I don't need hostages anymore Now, I trust you Let's take a picture together - Now? - Yes! Because I'm very happy now Right this moment I want a witness who'll testify that I was happy You, Neil, and Armstrong all in a picture together But looking like this? Now is the best you've looked since I've known you Hurry! Hurry! Mina! What are you looking for? A sea turtle Where is it anyway? Why? You'll go to Hawaii to see one soon, anyway? Didn't you say it would be hard to find one, even in Hawaii? Of course, not all people can find a sea turtle, but I will help you find one No matter how difficult So don't worry The sea turtles aren't on display They're having their regular checkups Why so disappointed? I'll show you a real one soon One not locked up in a tiny Aquarium but one in the real Pacific... Let's get something nice to eat Mina! Mina! Mina! Mina! That poor guy is pathetic Losing his love being left alone Being crazy because of love Now, I trust you! I want you to take this back I should've noticed something was wrong from the beginning I thought it was a lot of money just to spend time with your daughter and take pictures of her If I take this money, it means I met Mina because of money I can't do that If I do that I could never see her again Sorry I am sorry really sorry, Young- jae Unlike what most people think Hawaii has distinct seasons These distinctions are clear to Hawaiians It is summer when the ripe mangoes begin to fall and when you smell ginger flower in the wind The signs of winter are the rains and huge waves that surfers love The people who live in cool places such as Kauai and Maui Islands... gather by the fire around Christmastime Hawaii has a warm climate all year Rainy from October to March Dry from April to September However, the weather changes only slightly between seasons so you can enjoy sunny skies most of the year You can often find sea turtles along the coast And the turtles are waiting for Mina to come to see them Why don't you get some rest? I'll stay here Let's go, Misuk What are we going to talk about today? Oh, yes We'll go to the west beach and see the "green flash" sunset You can only see it on totally clear day at the last moment when the sun sinks beneath the horizon Some say it will give you love Some say it grants wishes What is this? - Is that a real human hand? - It's creepy Yeah, it's creepy Let's go! We've graduated All the good seasons are gone Now, what am I going to do for living? Whatever you do just take care of yourself Broken arms and broken legs... So pathetic! Should we commit some kind of wild scam together? - What? - To make some money I am so sorry I know that I did a terrible thing to you Please understand it as a selfish mother's love and forgive me And one more... This... To my dear Youngjae who shared the happiest time of my life To my dearest Mom... I know it must've been hard for you to do this for me, thank you I don't know how many more days I have but I'll be happy I want to give this to you as a present, before I leave And I am really happy now
