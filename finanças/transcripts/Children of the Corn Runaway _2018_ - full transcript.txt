(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) BOY: When their time came, he called them. One by one, the oldest among them walked into the corn and were gone. Ruth feared He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Now, she began to hate him, too. He had taken her friends. He had taken the boy she loved. She had nothing left but the new life growing inside her. And he would not take that. So, she did the only thing she could think of. Burn the corn. (LOCUST BUZZING) (CHILDREN SCREAMING) BOY: Burn He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Burn her past. (CAR ENGINE REVING) And run. (GROANS, GRUNTS) RUTH: Not yet. (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (RUTH SIGHING) (CAR RUMBLING) (CAR DOOR OPENING) (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) You can have him. You can have him. You can have him.

Whatever happened to "Mom"? Sounds like baby talk. BOY: I thought Ruth was kinda crazy. We mostly lived in our truck. I was thinking I could get maybe 50 bucks for this? (MAN CHUCKLING) Yeah, right. - BOY: It got old. - Take it to the office. (FORK LIFT BEEPING) (URINE TRICKLING) I'm so glad that we're in a hotel. - (TOILET FLUSHING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) Do you know snakes can breathe from their tongue? - RUTH: Mm-hm. - (WATER RUNNING) - You're wasting water, you know. - (SPITS) I know. Isn't it wonderful? (CHUCKLES) (WOMAN MOANING) WOMAN: No. Don't. No, don't. You should finish. Hurry up. Get off of me! Stop! Ugh! I just faked it. (DOOR CLOSING) (THUDS) Fuck. Goddamn it. Fucker. MAN ON RADIO: For the flesh desires what is contrary to the spirit, and the spirit, what is contrary to the flesh. But are there any who still doubt that the wages of sin is death? RUTH: I hate all that religious crap. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) BOY: Don't you miss anybody? Don't you ever wanna stop? - Meet people? - No. BOY: I wanna go to a school. A real school. MAN ON RADIO: Where you go, I will go. And where you stay... (STATIC) MAN ON RADIO: ...where you die, where you live... Ruth. - Did you turn that back on? - Huh? Nothing. (SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE) RUTH: Shit. Ma'am, can I ask you to turn off the engine, please? (ENGINE STOPS) Where y'all headed? Nowhere in particular. I don't suppose you packed your license and registration. You were weaving like a cut cat back there. Can I ask you to step outside, please? - (CAR DOOR OPENS) - Stay here. MAN: Follow me back here. You just stay there, son. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) - Will we get our truck back? - (SIGHS) I don't know. Maybe it's a good excuse to stay put. Really? You mean it? I don't know. Maybe. BOY: Like, permanent? No. Like, a couple few weeks till we get this truck thing sorted out. RUTH: Okay. I got this. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) BOY: Hey, Mom. Over here. Hello? MAN: Back here. Help you? I'm here about the mechanic job. You got experience? - Some. - Such as? Um... - Salvage, mostly. - Yeah. We fix cars here. We don't strip 'em for parts. I got a truck. It's got, like, a million miles on it. Never once been in a shop. - That's all well and good. - Not once. I need the money. Listen, I run a business here. Not a charity. Hope things work out for you. (RAIN PATTERING) I'm sorry. It's just the way it is. We can't help that. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) - Ruth, look out! Get back! - (RUTH GASPS) Careful there, son. You don't wanna crack a lady's skull on your back swing. Get your stuff and come on. It's... It's nothing fancy, but it's dry. - It's all good. - Thank you. What's with all the old bikes outside? My kid, she, uh... she used to collect 'em. I put 'em together. That was our deal. She and her mom got run down by a drunk. Don't forget, you're out of here at sunrise. I got it. And if I see anything missing... (GARAGE DOOR RATTLING, BANGING) (RUTH MUTTERING) Cut 'em down, plant the seed, spread their blood... Mom? RUTH: Cut 'em down, plant the seed, spread their blood, watch Him feed, bleed and die, then cut 'em down. (CONTINUES MUTTERING) Cut 'em down and plant the seed and spread their blood. Mom. CHILDREN: Cut them down, plant the seed, spread their blood. - (MUTTERING) - BOY: Mom. CHILDREN: Watch and feed, bleed and die. Bleed and die, bleed and die. BOY: Mom. Oh, my God. Aaron. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Aaron, why did you sneak up on me like that? I didn't. I was talking the whole time. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. What were you doing? I just... I couldn't sleep, so I... (MUTTERS) It doesn't matter. Let's get you to bed. I can't sleep either. Fair enough.

You coming? (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) Order whatever you want. Your mom has a job. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (MAN SCREAMING) (PLATES SMASHING, CLATTERING) You'd think we're on the deck of the Titanic or something. The specials, they're up on the white board, except for the chicken fried chicken, - and we are out of that. - How about that fried chicken? - WAITRESS: That we got. - How can you have fried chicken but not have chicken fried chicken? Is he gonna be trouble or what? (CHUCKLES) Your toast is burning. I don't cook. Hey, doll, how about my five over easy? Here you go, sweetheart. Over easy with a side of toast, well done. What about my bacon? I always have bacon. Well? Think I'll get the onion burger and fries with the chocolate shake. WAITRESS: That's a good call. (DOOR OPENING, BELL JINGLING) Here you go.

Thanks for distracting everybody from the crappy job I'm doing. Come on, get that crazy bitch the hell out of here. Excuse me, Rally, but in this confusion, did I miss the part where you bought this shithole and became my boss? You seen what she did. Now, sit your fat ass back down on that stool. MAN: Hey, Rally, don't take that shit. Are you all right there, hit girl? (DOOR OPENS) Yeah, I'm all right. You didn't have to stick up for me back there. Oh. (CHUCKLES) I sure as hell did. You know, you are not from around this town, which automatically makes you my favorite customer. (CHUCKLES) Did you hear the locust again? Whenever you hear that sound, whatever happens next, it's not real. No, I know, but this time was different. I... (SIGHS) I don't know why. Different like... different how? Different like the difference between a painting and a photograph. You go back in there and finish your burger. What about you? I gotta go to work. I'm fine. - Ruth. - Go.

(RALLY GRUNTING) (RALLY GRUNTS, GROANS) (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (PIANO PLAYING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) MAN: Been over a year since the old man kicked. And his kids are still bickering over what to do with the place. I love it just the way it is. RUTH: You have no idea what this means to us. Oh, I... I imagine I do. I get the bedroom at the top of the stairs! I gotta get back to the shop. (SIGHS) (CLICKING) I'll see you tomorrow. MAN: I'm counting on it. You know what? I'm thinking about putting you in school. Here, in Luther? Looks like we may be here a while. What do you think? Yeah, cool. Good night, dream boy. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) WOMAN: What are you doing here?

(BIRDS CHIRPING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) RUTH: Time to get up. - (AARON GROANS) - (CHUCKLES) Get dressed. You got a big day ahead. (GROANS) You're the one that wanted to go to a real school. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) We will need proof of residency. Like what? Current utility bill, a lease, mortgage agreement... Something that verifies that you live in the school district. I don't have that. We just got here a couple days ago, so... Sorry. We'll be happy to process your application when you have the proper documentation. (SCOFFS) Are you telling me that if I don't have a real home, I can't put my kid in your school? I don't make the rules, Ms. Clawson. And by the way, we haven't even gotten to the hard part yet. What's the hard part? Proof of parental status. Excuse me? Aaron, can you step outside for just a second? Thank you. If you wanna shack up with that colored boy... - that's your business. - What are you saying? I'm saying that maybe you should think twice about setting down roots here in Luther. Maybe you should just... take your little circus of crazy and hit the road. And what if I don't? We don't like trouble. We are a peaceful, God-fearing town, Ms. Clawson. Mm, yeah, I can tell. Well, then... It was really nice meeting you. It's a fine boy you have here. You should be proud. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (BOY LAUGHING) - (CHILDREN LAUGHING) - (BELL JINGLING) Look at them, their holier-than-thou attitudes. It's like they've never seen an unwed mother sucker punch a defenseless kid before. Look, I just... I wanted to say how sorry I am. No, are you kidding? You did me a favor. Those little bastards come in here every weekend just to hang out, never spend a dime. Oh, I'm Sarah, by the way. Ruth. This is Aaron. How about another onion burger there, "A-ron"? AARON: Yeah. Call me anytime. She would if she ever got a phone. MAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You two lovebirds down there, when you're finished with your lesbian love act, I could sure as hell use some goddamn warm-up here. Please. Excuse me, duty calls. MAN: Hey, Sarah, you reckon Mr. Hatcherson minds you comping all of those people up there? - Who said I was comping 'em? - I know what you're doing. You're stealing his fucking money. Those freebies, they add up, girl. Well, thank you, Crusty, for looking out for my job security. - You're a real sweetheart. - Ahh! - You crazy bitch! You burned me! - SARAH: I'll get that. You burned the hell out of me! Goddamn! You know, I'd be happy to comp that for you. (BOTH LAUGH) CRUSTY: Damn. Yeah, you comp everybody else. SARAH: Oh, I gotta get you that onion burger. This man looks like he's starving. Um, I gotta get to work, but I can be back in an hour or so and pick him up. Yeah, don't worry about it. He can hang here - as long as he wants. - You sure? Yeah. We'll be just fine. Look, best buds already. I just... I don't wanna put you out any more than I've already... We're fine, Mom. Go. Yeah, Mom. Hasta la vista. Okay. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Um, great. I'll... I'll be back... later. (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES) - (TRAIN HORN BLARING) - (DOG BARKING) Here you go. You know, I get the feeling that there's some stuff going on between the two of you that... I don't know, it just doesn't come out in words. Living life on the road just the two of y'all, it must be tough, right? I mean, just not having your own personal space, time for yourself. Friends. (LIQUID POURING) Shoot, I bet you'd kill to have a normal life. Yeah, kinda. (HOOD BANGING) You smell good. Like oil soap. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Where are you from? What do you mean? I don't know. Like, where'd you grow up? - Where's your family from? - Nebraska. - Ah, you're a corn husker. - A what? You're empty. Hmm? Oh, yeah, um... (SCOFFS) How'd that happen? (CHUCKLES) You don't much like talking about yourself, do you? Uh-uh. Mystery girl. (SIGHS) I don't know. Haven't done that for a while. We don't have to do this.

Son, why don't you just... just go on back to your room? Everything's fine down here. You need to leave, Carl. You know what? You got a problem, and it ain't me. Get out. I've been nothing but decent to you. Both of you. (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENING, SLAMMING) Aaron? Aaron! Aaron! (CAR DOOR CREAKS) (RUTH SIGHS) (RUTH CLEARS HER THROAT) I don't know what happened. Um... I just... We were talking and... and he just started to get all sweet on me, and I... (SIGHS) It was nothing. Did you love my father? I think so. I don't know. It was so long ago. Do you miss having a man around? Not when I have you around. You're the only thing that matters. You always will be. Hey. Um... - About last night, I... - It was nothing. I can't have somebody working for me that doesn't look me in my eye when I'm talking! Better? Yeah, better. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) SARAH: Hey! Come on, Crusty. Really? Here. Why don't you take him outside? SARAH: Hey, that thing, the sound you were hearing, it's them? RUTH: How did you know about that? Um, Aaron told me. - (RUTH SIGHS) - SARAH: Hey, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. I just... He worries about you sometimes. I'm fine. SARAH: Don't be angry with him. He's a good kid. I get to decide when to be angry with him. (DOOR OPENING, BELL JINGLING) I gotta get back to work. You coming? Haven't finished my burger yet. - SARAH: Here, I can take it... - No, it's fine. Stay. Finish. (METAL CLANKING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (SOBS) (SIGHS) What's that? - Nothing. - Let me see. That girl teach you how to do this? What? It's okay. I just wanna know. Look. Hey. It doesn't matter. I just wanna know who taught you how to do that. You did. (SIGHS) (WOOD CREAKING) (DOOR SLAMMING) (DOOR CLOSING) (DOORKNOB RATTLING) Aaron, are you in there? Aaron. Aaron, you need to open the door. Aaron. (PANTING) - Don't! - Aaron, I wanna close it. Just... don't. - I said... (SIGHS) - I'm your mother.

Again. All right. I apologize. All right. That was Ms. Carruthers. Ring a bell? - Gray Stratus. - Yeah. Well, you changed the oil, but forgot to put the cap back on. She got halfway to El Reno before the engine seized. That's... That's not possible. Doesn't much matter. Wait. (SCOFFS) You're not firing me over this. There's no way. I'm the best mechanic you've ever had. I'm sorry, Ruth. This just ain't working out. Which part? Screwing up the job or not screwing the boss? I really wouldn't go there. I'll pay you through the week, and that's me being generous. (SIGHS) You can't do this. Well, now, I guess it's your turn to get the hell out. (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (LOCUST BUZZING) (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) AARON: What are you doing? (STOVE KNOB CLICKING) (STOVE KNOB CLICKING) Pernell thinks his soup's cold. (GROANS) Goddamn it! That was good.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES) Mommy's gonna get some medicine, okay, Aaron? (AARON COUGHS) You stay here. Mommy's gonna be right back, okay? It's okay, baby. It's all right. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (ALARM RINGING) (AARON CRYING) RUTH: I'm sorry, Aaron. I would do anything to save you, my beautiful boy. (BELL JINGLES) Hey, Joe. (BELL JINGLING) Hey, you're up early. - I need your help. - Uh, sure. Are you okay? I know I have no right to burden you with this. Uh, do you wanna go somewhere where we could be alone? No, no, it's okay. He can hear this. I want him to hear this. Have you ever heard of Gatlin, Nebraska? Yeah, where they had that mass killing a decade or so ago. One of the children heard a voice. And they thought that voice came from God, but it didn't. It was something else. And so, all these children began to follow this... this... Yeah, I remember. (RUTH SIGHS) I was one of those kids. Didn't they all set fire to themselves? Not all of 'em. (CHAIR SLIDING) When I got pregnant with Aaron, things changed. And I realized they wanted him. After Gatlin, we just kept moving around. We never stayed in one place more than a day or two at a time, and... I don't know, I just felt like we were being... followed. Not by any one person but by different people in different places. How could you tell? You just... you kinda get a sense of things. I don't... I don't really know how to explain it, but they, um... I need you to do something for me. One thing. Just one thing, and I can handle the rest. Get my son as far away from here as you possibly can. I need you to do this for me, Sarah, please. I... I don't know. - I don't know what to say. - Just get him away from here. I know that I have no right to put this on you, but he cannot be here, not now. You could both leave together. No, I have to do something, and it can't involve Aaron. SARAH: What? There's someone in this town. She's gonna do something terrible. SARAH: How do you know? I know how she thinks. You know how crazy that sounds. Then if I'm crazy, that is even more reason for you to get my son to a safer place. Please. I don't know. Look, I've done something awful, Sarah, 13 years ago. And I can't take it back. All that I can do is make sure it never happens again, ever. This is the last thing that I have that I can give to this world, to my son. Now, I'm asking, I'm begging you, please, help me make this right. Okay. I got this stick-for-brains ex up in Tulsa. He's a total loser, but he's great with kids. - I can take him there. - (SIGHS) Thank you so much. You are a total godsend. No problem. - (RUTH SIGHS) - Okay, one tiny problem. - What? - I don't have a car. (KEYS JINGLING) Oh, hey, I have an appointment for a root canal in 22 minutes. Uh, it's the pea green Hyundai. That one right there. I have to be in the city by 8:00, and with rush hour the way it is... Shirke, Candy Shirke. I have the estimate right here. Oh... (SIGHS) I'm in for a broken fan belt, a new radiator hose, and you were gonna check the bushings, too. I get this grindy noise when I accelerate, - especially on cold... - RUTH: Carl? I really can't afford to be late. He promised that the car would be ready at 7:30... Shut up! (SCREAMING) RUTH: Carl? (SCREAMING) (CAR ALARM BLARING) (RUTH WHIMPERING) (GIRL LAUGHING) (GIRL LAUGHING) They'll think I did this. That's the plan, right? (GIRL LAUGHING) (KEYS CLINKING) Come out.

(SOBBING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) SARAH: Whenever I'm up here, I'm just struck by the perfection of it all. Little farmers down there sowing their fields every spring. You know, if you're quiet, you can actually hear the corn growing. And then comes the harvest, and it starts all over again. It's... It's a beautiful thing. We're not going to Tulsa, are we? Nope. Didn't think so. (SARAH CHUCKLES) RUTH: Oh, God. (PANTING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) What are you doing here? You little whore! Bitch!

(WOOD CREAKING) (WRENCH CLINKING) (WOOD CREAKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Sooner or later, you have to deal with it, sweetie. You're still part of us. - And we're still part of you. - No. No. No? Then why keep using your biblical name, Ruth, and not the name that your parents gave you? What was it again? Sandra, I think it was. Sandy. Where's my son? He's doing just fine. We're already getting along like soulmates. Did you know he's never read the Bible? Not a page. I want him back. You don't really want that. Not in your condition. I mean, look at yourself. Is that the face of a responsible mother? (WRENCH THUDS) (GASPS) Sweetie, come here. Remember how it felt when you sliced open your mother's throat? You watched her bleed out. And that look of utter surprise. You kept that lock of hair as a keepsake, remember? Of all your childhood mementos, this was the one that you couldn't part with. Death was such a mystery back then. It still is. It just comes a lot easier now, doesn't it? Those poor kids. Your brothers and your sisters trapped in a cornfield... burning alive. I want my son. Well, we're gonna have to get over that. I want my son! I know you want what's best forAaron. Where is he? SARAH: He's here. He's downstairs. What? What? No. No. He can't... He can't see this. RUTH: Aaron. Please, baby. - I'm sorry. - Be careful what you wish for. What did you do? Come here. Please. Baby, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. (RUTH SIGHS) Mommy... Mommy is sick. You were right. I know that now. Everything is much, much clearer now. No, don't! Don't, don't, don't! Why...? You're afraid of me. I... I get that. But I'm your mother. And I need you to listen, okay? I have something I gotta tell you. Sarah... ...is not who you think she is, okay? You gotta stay away from her, you understand? You understand what I'm saying? Just keep away from her. She's not your friend. She's your enemy. She's who we've been running from for your entire life. You understand me? She's the darkness. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (SNIFFLES) Promise me, promise me, the second that I let go, that you are gonna run, okay? That you're gonna run, you're gonna run and run and run, and you're never gonna look back, okay? You promise, okay? (SNIFFLES) I love you. I love you. (CHUCKLES) I love you too. (GROANS) (GROANS) (GROANS) RUTH: Cut them down, plant the seed. Spread their blood, watch Him feed. And bleed and die. And bleed and die. AARON: In the end, Ruth finally understood. She wasn't running away from her destiny. - She was running to it. - (AARON SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - And I am, too. - AARON:...must be cut down so that what is pure and unspoiled may take its place. Lord, give me thy strength to seek out which is impure, that which is unholy, that which dishonors thy name in treachery and betrayal. Let me by thy sword, by thy sickle, and by thy fire! Lord, let thy righteous fury guide my hand until the land is once again cleansed of sin, until the fields are ready to be sown again, nourished by the blood of the corrupted souls that walk among us even now. To your will, I commit myself, body and soul... for time eternal. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (LOCUST BUZZING) (MUSIC BOX PLAYING)
