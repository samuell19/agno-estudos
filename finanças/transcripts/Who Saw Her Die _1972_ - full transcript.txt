MEGEVE, France - That's it, I've found one! - Me too! - Yes, but I got here first. - No, I did. No, I did. Here you go. - We need something to cover its head. - Your hat. - No, Nicole, not my hat... - Your hat! No! Stop it, Nicole. - Where are you going, Nicole? - I'm leaving. Catch me if you can! - No, Nicole. Come back! - Catch me. Nicole, come back! Nicole! Nicole! - Nicole, come back. - No! I'm gonna hide, I'm gonna hide. Nicole? Here, I'm going to find you. Nicole. Nicole, where are you? WHO SAW HER DIE? COLD CASE UNKNOWN MURDERER VENICE 1972 Dad! Here she is, the Flying Dutch girl. - The trip went well? - Yes. - Did you have fun? - Yes. Doves! Doves! Doves, doves? I'm back! Come and eat! Yes? Forward the call. - Roberta! - Why don't you come? - Mom's on the phone. - Corning! Hello? How are you, Elizabeth? She's already here, yes. She's in one piece, don't worry. She's growing up. Next time, she'll be wearing a bra! - Is it work or romance keeping you there? - Give it to me. Mom, it's beautiful and sunny here. And you know dad bought me a bouquet of roses? It's as big as me. And you know that dad got annoyed cos you didn't come with me? And he shut the door and left. This is how I run press campaigns. There's nothing I can't do! You understand that Venice is a desert? Yet it could be the Italian Las Vegas. More casinos, theaters, cinemas, art galleries, everything bigger, with high standards, fun without limits, you understand? If it continues like this, it's gonna be a dead city. It'll be beautiful. I can already picture it, completely underwater. Its bell towers poking out from the water. And a white sail boat, my boat. What a dream city! That wouldn't look bad in a painting. By the way, don't you work anymore? - You haven't shown me anything lately. - I have nothing left here. I sent everything to a gallery in Turin. Hi, Vernon. So, Serafian set you up, then. I knew sooner or later you would've given up. What's that? Did a woman scratch you? No, nothing to worry about. I was doing my usual training and I didn't want to put on a mask. Roberta, what music is that? - Want to see the printing presses? - No. - Why? - I prefer music. I can't say I ever have any success with women! Who saw her die? "Me," says the midge - Can you make me fly? - Why not? - Come on! - Ready? Stop. Stop. Your Grace. - Father James! - Hey, how are you? - Not bad. - You had fantastic reviews. Quite good, yes. I wouldn't dare to ask you but... Not at all, I've prepared some paintings for the charity auction. They'll be the centerpiece. - This is my daughter. - Your daughter? I didn't know you had a daughter. I don't live here, I live in Amsterdam. You're very pretty. - Like her dad. - I look like my mom! - Hi. - Hi, Roberta. - Where did you go yesterday? - To Burano, to see how they make lace. Do you know my mom? Of course. - My mom's very pretty, isn't she? - She is beautiful. - Hi. - Hi. Impressive. She looks more and more like Elizabeth every day. Yeah. And the same temper, right? Why she didn't come with the kid? Well I don't know, we get more distant with every year. Never mind. How come you're here? You need anything? No, thank you. I was passing by, so I thought I'd warn you that Serafian's back from Beirut. Thank you. I saw Gabriella. She asked after you. She was feeling down. Right now, I want to take care of only one woman, Roberta. Tell her. - See you tomorrow, then. - Bye. An ice cream, please. - I surprised you. - Gosh, you scared me. The lady goes to eat ice cream all alone, and then she says I scare her! - The beautiful Ginevra. - Hi, Franco. Give me those. - Thanks. - Serafian is waiting for you. - And who are you? - The knight, don't you see? And dad's my wild horse. Filippo, you're here as well? You're like a bad penny. A bad seed, maybe. We were talking about you. Don't be fooled, today he's cheaper than usual. - Hi, ginger. - Hi. Down you come, now. Today's artists believe that their creations have nothing to do with great works from the past. But it's just an illusion. They don't realize the historical expression of their time, so, their works are nothing more than a logical evolution on that premise. History is like a machine, Serpieri, magic wires along paths already covered. I hope you'll cover mine in a good way. Don't worry. Some weeks ago, they asked me to join a company in Paris. But if I could have my own... I could deal with it. I know many people in Paris, and I think I could organize... Better not. I don't think it's time for you to take any further initiatives. I see, Serafian. You never change, you're always the same wonderful person. Don't worry, Serpieri. Women are always a bit... Look at these paintings and tell me what you think about them. - I need you, Ginevra. - Admit you can make love only with me. I admit I recovered my stability thanks to you. That's why I need you. - Filippo, this is just your problem. - You and I have to be together. - You don't understand, Serafian could... - Speak quietly! Here's your check. Didn't you write too many zeros? I hope you can be my guest in Beirut. I would like you to be there at the opening. There'll be many public figures. Roberta... - Which month were you born? - In February. - You know Aquarius is your zodiac sign? - Yes. - What is Aquarius? - The stars you see in February. - My stars, then. - Yes. This is your lucky day. - Goodbye, Serpieri. - See you soon. Your turn. - Come on, let's go home. - A little longer, Mom. Don't make a fuss. Move, it's late. - When I say something, you must obey. - OK, but I'm not doing any homework. You do what I say, or I'll beat you! Come on, come on! - No, I'm not thirsty. - Fine. Super fresh! They were caught this morning. You always say the same thing. - You know what is it? - No. A telephone. Look... - Hello? - Hello? - Madame, would you like to dance? - Yes. Perfect. Tonight I'll pick you up in my golden gondola. - Really? - Sure, I'm a magician, I can do anything. You believe this is a telephone? Now watch how to eat them. They're exquisite, you know? - But it's only a shell. - That's not true. Look. The creature's flesh breaks away. You see? Now eat. Come on. - It disgusts me. - How can you say that before even trying it? I can see it, right? - What do you want, then? - Cake. - Will you let me play? - Come on. OK, go. Hold this. I'll play too! Did you miss me? She's pretty, isn't she? Are you jealous of her? Come on, let's catch up on old times. - You could've at least called me. - Not again, Gabriella. Gather around me. Form a circle. Who will cry for the dead one? The turtle dove says: "I, the beautiful one, will cry for the dead one" Who saw her die? "Me," says the midge "With 'this little eye "I saw her die" The sparrow says, "I, with the bow and the arrow, I" The sparrow says, "I killed the robin" It's better if you go now, I have to work. - You're ashamed of me. - No, come on. You think I'm not worthy of your daughter. - Am I right? - Don't be silly. I just don't want her to have a problem seeing us together. - Sometimes I don't understand you. - There's nothing to understand. Nowadays, kids have a different approach to life. OK, I'll get psychoanalyzed, I promise you. Go screw yourself! I told you to come up. Come on! Maria! Maria! No, not that one. It's mine. Give it to me! It's my necklace! Thieves! Roberta? Mrs. Piera, have you seen my daughter? Egizia, where did Roberta go? I don't know. An hour ago, she was playing with Claudio Zardin. Where does this Zardin live? - Campiello dell'Orso. - Thank you, goodnight. See you. Where does Claudio Zardin live? - There, around the corner. - Thanks. Who are you? - I'm looking for Claudio Zardin. Is he home? - No, he is not. He went to the cinema. No, he didn't go to the cinema. He never goes at this time. He is at the gym. That gym nearby. Father James' one. - I said he went to the cinema. - Please, you don't know anything. I understand, thanks. What do you know, you drunkard? - My turn to shoot. - Come on, pass it to me. - I'll shoot now. - Shoot! - Dribble. - Good, like that. Now you try. What are you doing down there? Alright. Stay calm. Look how I dribble, look. - Do you know Claudio Zardin? - He's over there. Which one? There are many. - The one on the chair. - Thank you. The ball? - It's mine! - I'm telling you, it's mine! Take it if you can. - Was Roberta Serpieri with you? - I don't know who she is. - She's got freckles and red hair. - I don't know her. - Who gave you this? - It's mine, leave it! - Calm down. Stop it, don't pull it! - I'll tell Father James! - I just wanted to... - Go away, leave me alone! - What's happening? - I asked him about my daughter. She didn't come home. This is her locket. - Where's Roberta? - The girl with this locket? She went home. - Fine, go and play. - I'm worried. I've been looking for her for half an hour, but nothing. Maybe she's back by now, you know how kids are. I hope so. Thank you. Come here, guys. Around me. Hurry! Come on, give it to me. Don't be afraid, you will see everything. Comets, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury. Robefla! Murderers! Criminals! Look at the cat. It's all burned, but it still moves its tail. It burns just like the world we've seen on television. It's in a good place. Hello? Nothing yet? Did you check the area? Did you make calls in the neighborhood? Yes, I searched every possible place. Inspector, you had promised me that... Yes, I'll stay at home and wait to hear from you. I understand! Fucking police! Franco, don't do this. You won't solve anything by blaming them. I'm sure they'll find her. Venice is big, but nobody ever disappears. Inspector, what can you do now? It's a little late. Sadly, yes. But I have my reasons to be here. I know how to do my job. Sooner or later, we'll find him. We don't care about that anymore. - I'm done! I'm done! - Stop it! I won't do anything anymore! - It was all my fault! - Stop it, please! - We'll go crazy like this. - I have to kill him with my own hands! Why are you acting like this? I shouldn't have left you. I'm also to blame. I called you here, because I found some odd links with Roberta's death. Last year, another child disappeared who was recently found dead. She was called Marinella Marchesin. She ended up like your poor Roberta. What surprised me was that both of them had red hair. A fisherman said a weird thing. GIRL FOUND MURDERED ON SCHIAVONI WATERFRONT A few hours before the tragedy, Marinella was playing in a square, and next to her there was an old lady, dressed in an unusual way, and she was talking to her about something. I don't know why she didn't show up. Finally, there's another similarity. Marinella Marchesin was raped as well. Let me read it. These two people are asking for you. What could I know about my daughter's death? She's dead, case closed. After all, I can't start playing cop. Leave me in peace. I don't want to play cop, I just want to find who killed my daughter. I don't have kids anymore, and other people's kids are none of my business. Now excuse me, the glass is getting cold. It's the right lead, I'm sure. - He's hiding something. - Don't kid yourself, Franco. Anyway, I'll come with you. Go back home. I'll catch up with you later. Don't leave me alone in that house. You know I'm scared. Don't be silly. It's better if I go alone. Wait for me there, please. I'll be back soon. Excuse me, did the Marchesin family used to live here? Hey, did they live in this house? What the hell? I'm talking to you! Are you deaf? - They're not here. They left. - I know that. - I want to know if they used to live here. - Let's play table tennis. - I don't have time... - Just two serves. The Marchesin family? Very bad story. Relax your arm, relax it! How come they moved out? The mother was in a very bad condition, poor dear, after her daughter's death. She couldn't think straight. And sadly the father didn't have a job. The attorney Bonaiuti found him a job at the glassworks, and he paid for her treatment. Who's Bonaiuti? The guy in that scandal? They always talk ill about rich people. What do you know about the death of their child? What are you saying? I wasn't here when the crime was committed. I was sailing to China! If you can't play table tennis, don't get involved in politics! - Thank you, Father. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Whatever you need, you know where to find me. Thanks. I want to leave with you. - What made you change your mind? - It doesn't matter. Maybe I love you. I want to leave Serafian and disappear. And you can help me. You know how important you are to me. But it won't be easy to get rid of them. You just have to want it, that's all. We have to help each other, if we want to keep living, Filippo. Come on, get undressed. Ginevra, calm down. We just have to wait. Don't lose control. I've been keeping control for years. I'm tired, I want to leave. They'd find you. You're in over your head, even if you find it inconvenient now. No, it's unacceptable. I have to get this over with. Serafian doesn't even care that you're sleeping with me. He'd never let you go. But I'm afraid, Filippo. I'm afraid. I can't stand it anymore. I disgust myself. Be careful, Ginevra. Being afraid can be very dangerous, you know that. Ginevra is free to do whatever she wants. You pigs! I'll make you pay for that! My dear Serpieri. I just came back tonight. And now the attorney Bonaiuti has informed me... - ls there anything I can do? - No, thanks. Why don't you come with me to Beirut? No... I still don't feel like working, believe me. Thanks, Serafian. Call me if you change your mind. - Think about it. - Yes. - It would be good for you. - I'll think about it. Mr. Serpieri... the attorney Bonaiuti is ready to see you. I've been expecting you, Serpieri. And I know why you're here. You want to know the reasons that led me to help the Marchesin family. - Am I right? - Yes. I find it odd that they warned you about why I was coming. I'm a philanthropist, my dear Serpieri. I like to help people in need. I'm rich, fortunately. And many of my friends are the most influential people in the city. Filippo Venier told me about you. You've had such an awful experience. I was talking about this last night with Inspector De Donato. They're getting nowhere. I know that. I'm following different leads, coincidences, questioning people's inhibitions and compassion. Have you ever invited children to your strange parties? I won't stand for that. - Get out of my house. - My daughter was killed! And the murderer could be one of your friends! I understand your pain, so I forgive you for your irresponsible accusations. Andrea, show this gentleman out. Then come back to clean the spillage. Serpieri... I wish you luck with the Beirut exhibition. Inspector De Donato, please. Is that you, Inspector? He's not there? Where can I find him? No. No, thank you. I'll call back. Hi, Elizabeth, it's me. Yes, I know. Yes. Listen, did Cuma show up? No? How come? I have to talk to him. Yes, I called you just to tell you... Elizabeth, I'll see you soon. Franco? - Madame. - Calm down, Elizabeth. What happened? Mother Mary, what a fright! Hit. Mariani, raise your arm. Hit. Loosen your wrist, Marcolin. Strike. Hit. Vagnago, it's a foil not a club! Morning, Franco. Why are you here? I always had a thing for fencing. You two know each other? - Yes. - Yes, we've met before. It's the second time we've met each other today. Hit. Change! Well done. - You did well. - Not at all. - You know I'm not in shape. - Pair up! Venier-Morion, Ucci-Tolentini. Gardin-Velaschi, on the piste. See you this evening, then. - I have to talk to you. - About what? Speak quietly. Let's meet here tonight. I'll wait for you at the Progresso Cinema, fourth row on the right. Is this about Roberta? - Not now... - Mrs. Storelli? - Yes. - Sorry. So, what's the urgency? I'm always afraid when I'm alone. My nerves are shot. What the hell are you afraid of? Franco, be more understanding. - You two don't want to understand that... - Can I have a word? Excuse me. What is it? If I don't get my hands on that pig, I'll go crazy. We've found each other again, Franco. And now... let's leave Venice and start over, I beg you. No. No, Elizabeth. Away from here, it'd be even worse for me. Why can't you understand? - But, Franco... - Enough! Let's talk at home. I have to go back to the paper, sorry. Who'd have seen that coming? Somebody must've warned him. Ginevra! Stop! Stop her! Murderer! Did you see what happened? Talk if you know something, Serpieri. Stop playing cop. Why didn't you tell me about this meeting? Because I didn't think she'd tell me anything important. Ginevra used to act weird at times. She must've known plenty, to the point that the murderer wouldn't let her talk. I realize this too. Show me that. What do you know about Ginevra's death? Ginevra? Dead? I don't understand. What happened? This is yours! I ripped it off you last night. Yes, it's the same, but mine is over there. Show it to me! One moment... It was here a second ago. Here it is. I'm sure you're in over your head. There are too many coincidences. You knew Marchesin like you knew Ginevra, right? I didn't know the Marchesin family. I met Ginevra few years ago. She'd just arrived from Paris. It was her who told me about them, she wanted me to help them. - She knew I was generous. - I just know that Ginevra got rich here! - Was she blackmailing anybody? Serafian? - I don't know. I don't care. Go away, leave me alone. Speak or... She was Serafian's lover. She was under his control. He's an evil, egotistical, vicious man. He's capable of anything. You disgust me. Capable of murder as well. OPEN AFTER MY DEATH THE MURDERER OF LITTLE NICOLE FOUND? You have to do me a favor. I leave in an hour. - I'll leave you the house keys. - Why? Franco is completely out of control. He's not thinking straight anymore. He feels guilty for Roberta's death. And I live in terror. Don't you think that Franco needs you more than ever, right now? No. I thought about what you told me yesterday. Awful things are going to happen, and I'd have a nervous breakdown. I'd go crazy if I had to face another tragedy. You're right. You keep them. You never know. I'll write to you. You'll be informed of everything. If you need me, leave a message at the paper and I'll call you back. I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know how I can help you. - By the way, look at these. - What are they? Two flights to Caracas. A guy dropped them off this morning. One under Ginevra Storelli, and the other under Frangois Roussel. - Who is Frangois Roussel? - Never heard the name. I don't think Ginevra knew him either. Ginevra Storelli was your associate, and you didn't know about her trip to Caracas? I know nothing about her private life. You didn't know that Mrs. Storelli had large bank deposits either? That's odd. Very odd. We don't make big profits in our business. I heard she was your lover. There are many rumors about me. - When will you return from Beirut? - In three days. Unfortunately, despite the circumstances, I really can't postpone this trip. Your stop, Inspector. - Thank you. - If you need me, talk to Bonaiuti. He always know where to find me. Good. Oh, Serafian, who do you think this belongs to? No idea. We found it at the cinema, next to Ginevra's body. I've never seen it. See you soon. Go. Sir? Take this luggage to the station. And don't talk to anyone. Don't forget to lock the door. - Hello? - This is the Venier house. You are speaking to the automated answering service. Moor it back there, so nobody can see you. Costin? Costin! Here, boss! - You haven't seen me today, understand? - No worries. Good morning, Mr. Serpieri. Long time no see. Good morning. Where is Serafian? - I'm sorry, he's not here today. - I must see him. Where is he? He's stopped by the old mill, before his flight to Beirut... - I'll take this. Send me the rest. - Of course. Good morning. How are you? Look, Serafian has been very generous. He's given me some lovely objects for the charity auction. - I'll come for your drawings. - Not today, sorry. I'm in rush. Goodbye, Mr. Serpieri. It will be an amazing exhibition. It will be a great success, I'm sure. - Make a note of what I've chosen. - Come, Father, I'll take care of that. - Hey, do you know Serafian? - Who? The trader? Yes. They told me he was stopping by here. I've not seen him for over a month. I see... If I hadn't shot at him, he would've killed you. Get up, I'll help you. - Did you see who hit me? - No. I couldn't see him. Elizabeth. - What are you doing here? - I've been with some friends. How come you're back? I have a feeling. I arrived in Milan and came back. You were right. Franco has never needed me more than right now. He didn't come to pick you up? No, I didn't tell him. - I want to surprise him. - Better that way. I thought it was an abandoned station. I bought it. I liked the isolation of the place. I'll clean it up little by little. - What's your name? - Francesco Storelli. So who's Frangois Roussel? That's what I like to be called. Roussel was my mother's maiden name. This is yours, right? Yes, I was the one who hit you at Serafian's yesterday. I wanted to find clues about my mother's death, but this is all I found. What is it? Don't ask questions, just watch. Who is that strange guy? You'll see. And you'll also see what they were up to. It's awful to realize the depths to which my mother had sunk. But I'm sure she was coerced. Now I see they had plenty of things to hide. Do you know who the others involved are? I don't know. I wish I'd killed Serafian at the mill today. If I'd just found him... Depraved people. I trusted them. Serafian and my mother were associates. He pretended to be a family friend, he protected me, he supported me in Paris. I understood later why he wanted to keep me away from Venice. Who's the one sitting in the armchair? I don't know. My mom told me that Serafian was protecting somebody. It was either Serafian or Bonaiuti. I'm telling you, he's dead. They found him two hours ago with his throat cut like a pig. He no longer had any eyes. It seems that the birds... Listen, Franco, just give up. Elizabeth's waiting for you at home. Don't do anything stupid! Hello? Hello? - Speed up! - Once we leave the canal. I knew I'd find you here. Enough. I'm tired of protecting you. You're betraying me too. At the mill, you didn't let me kill Serpieri. I've always considered you sick, because you weren't yourself when killing. But with these calculated, cold-blooded murders, I can't allow it. Ginevra was going to talk, and Bonaiuti knew. He sent a letter on behalf of Ginevra to Serpieri! If Serpieri had received it, he would've gone to the police. - If I retrieve it, there'll be no proof. - Wrong. I will have proof. There's no escape for you. - You'll end up in an asylum. - No! Ginevra was going to talk, and Bonaiuti knew. He sent a letter on behalf of Ginevra to Serpieri! If Serpieri had received it, he would've gone to the police. - If I retrieve it, there'll be no proof. - Wrong. I will have proof. There's no escape for you. - You'll end up in an asylum. - No! No! I didn't want to kill those kids, but... but they had red hair. Just like mother. And they would've grown up to become women! Bitches just like mother! I can't help it, you understand that? I hit them and hit them and hit them... And the stone became red from blood, and the blood mixed with their auburn hair. I hate them! I hate them, like I hated her, our mother... - You killed Roberta. - It wasn't me! You killed Ginevra, because she was blackmailing you. - No! It was Serafian's brother. - Who? He killed Bonaiuti, because he had a letter. - What letter? - I don't know. - I brought it to your home. - What letter? Let me go! Help! Help! Franco! Father James! Who's there? I'm looking for Father James, I need him. He's not here. You left the door open. Where did he go? He went away because a child died from meningitis, poor thing. - When's he coming back? - Soon, lady. Soon. You can sit down, lady. You're not disturbing anyone. Come, sit down. Hopefully he'll be back soon. Elizabeth's waiting for you at home. Look, Serafian has been very generous. Inspector De Donato, can you comment on this maniac dressed up like a priest? Of course. It was a difficult case, but we solved it, thanks to our team. This French newspaper clipping tells the story of the murder of a child in Megéve, and about Father James, interviewed by French police back then. This confirmed our suspicions. We identified Father James as the person responsible, a fake priest and brother of the trader, Serafian, who protected him to avoid scandals. Eventually, he became a victim of his own brother's killing spree. All this made our job complicated... Franco! Wait for me! You know what they said? That they solved the case! THE END
