GERMANY, SPRING 1945 There he is! Get after him! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Let's go! Right. Fun time's over. Quickly! - Go, go! - Damn it! - Come on! - Let's move! - Get that son of a bitch! - You two, flank him! Come at him from both sides! Got you, private. - I want him alive. - Oh shit... Our mission can wait. Step down, Sergeant. Desertion is treason, Private. Against the Führer... Against the Fatherland... Treason. Poland, France, Italy, Russia. You've been around. Ah, shit, Köhler. Careful, you idiot. Iron Cross. A badge for tank destruction. Huh. Close Combat Clasp in bronze. And a face like something Arno Breker sculpted in marble. Aryan blood running through him, yet he has the heart of a coward. You're a disgrace. What is your reason for betraying the Fatherland? I never wanted this war. No one asked me. They just put me in this uniform, and I fought anyway like I'm told. Six years. Six senseless years. I'm done with this bullshit. We've all had to suffer our share of blows. And yes, we're on our knees. But we're not down yet. We'll get back up, and strike back. It's in our nature. It's in our blood! We fight, we suffer, we bleed and we die. But we are a people of victors. Hmm? We're a people of murderers. You're a tough son of a bitch, I'll give you that. Your neck won't snap immediately. I hope you die a slow death. - Yes. - Now you'll suffer a bit longer. Eventually, only after you've pissed and shit, and your swollen tongue is hanging outta your mouth like a rag, you'll be glad you finally stop breathing. Dörfler, you sick son of a bitch! We're ready. And now we get the gold. Finally! Let's get outta here! There's Papa! Papa, come with us. No, Karl, he can't. Your papa has to stay here. He needs to take care of Lottchen now. - Farewell. - Mama! Karl! Wait for me! - Mama! - Lottchen... Papa? Papa! Papa, don't leave me alone! Soldiers! Dad, there are soldiers here in town. - What, here in our village? - Mm-hmm. Bri... Brigitte, the Americans are here! No, Dad. It's our people. - It's gotta be SS. - What? Oh! Oh God. Get the portrait from the cellar and hang it up again. I'm not your lackey, Robert. Yeah... Elisa... beth... My name is Elsa, soldier. Hey! - Leave her! - It's all right, Paule. That's my brother. The paste helps. Elsa made it herself. Paule has a... special gift. You're pretty strong. Just like Reichsmarschall Gustav. Our old ox. Great. Now we can tie you in front of the plow. I don't think that's a good idea. You need rest. You must be hungry, soldier. My name... is Heinrich. Heil Hitler! Lieutenant Colonel! Robert Schlick. Mayor and local group leader, at your service. Johannes Löwenstein. Does the name mean anything... mayor? Yes, he was a Jew who used to live here in the village. Um... er, that is to say, his parents and siblings. Löwenstein himself lived in Essen, but visited regularly. Bring me to the house of the Löwensteins. They're not here anymore. I'm proud to report our village has been Jew-free since November '38, - Lieutenant... - You will take us to the house now. As you wish. Please follow me as I take you through our lovely village. It was a beautiful house, but also a beautiful fire. Happened a few days after we chased away those Jewish scum. - Yeah. I mean, if you play with fire... - What happened to the Jews' belongings? Did they take anything with them? Uh, we allowed them to take some pieces of clothing, but that's all. Was the house looted? Well, Möller took some pieces of furniture, and some of the women stocked up on dishes and bedsheets and the like. But other than that, no. American low-flyers. They've been buzzing around like mosquitos for days. - There's more and more. - You can go. - Huh? - If I need you, I'll call. Of course, Lieutenant Colonel. Oh... I just wanted to say, I also run the inn here. Crown Prince Rudolf, in town? And, well, we don't have much, but what we have, we'll be happy to share with you and your men, - Lieutenant... - That's understood. Yes. We'll have to clear every stone. It'll be a pain in the ass. If you had a little restraint, the Jew would have told us the exact hiding place. - They want the gold. - Sh! - Tell me, Robert. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then let's get out of here. And we can start again somewhere. How do you see that working? It's really not that simple. I have children. Yes, funny that. It's the balls you lack. Sonja! Why are you helping me? 'Cause I hate those Nazi bastards. Those filthy pigs killed our father. They picked him up two years ago for making subversive statements. And he never returned. The same people who ratted him out then drove us from our farm. I didn't want anyone to take a closer look at Paule. It's because I'm so pretty! Yeah. And we've been here since. Uh... I guess I've spoiled your appetite now? If you want, I'll tell you some of Dad's Hitler jokes. Oh yeah! Come on, Brigitte. Shake a leg. - They're thirsty men. - Well, you'd better work, then. "My dear whore Amie..." - Here you go... - What the hell, Dörfler, you ass? What? She'd suck cock for some nylon stockings. Control, gentlemen. Do you have anything better than this fucking slop? I'm sorry, Sergeant. We've got turnips coming out of our ears too. For someone who's starving, your boy looks in good shape. - That's right! - Tell me... Why is a strapping lad like yourself not on the front lines defending his Fatherland? Micha. Go peel potatoes in the kitchen. You will order a foraging expedition to all of the farmyards tomorrow. We need rations immediately. Who knows when we'll get another opportunity? Heil Hitler. Three beers. I have decided this inn is my new headquarters. Civilians are not welcome. Look. I think that's Dresden. Shit. My aunt lives there. Let's find that gold this morning! What happens when we have the gold? Do you think the lieutenant colonel will take it to the Führer? Hold on. I rounded up everyone who could hold a shovel. Good progress. We have no time to lose. The French have crossed the Rhine, and the Americans are coming from the south and the west. Lieutenant Colonel, sir. What? Do you really think we can break through enemy lines? We'll find a way. Our men are exhausted. They will regain strength in the Alpine fortress. In the mountains, we'll be surrounded on all sides. Have you lost your faith, Sergeant? In the Führer? Have you lost your faith in the final victory? - No. But... - Or are you also thinking of desertion? Like that private? Of course not, sir! Death... or victory. There is no other option. Didn't I order you to secure provisions? Rogge, move it. Get the provisions. You'll take care of it yourself. - Wouldn't it be better if I stayed here... - I have given you an order. Move out, Dörfler. Get ready to leave! You're the best, Rita. Huh? Good morning. I have to go. You badly needed that sleep. And a good breakfast, too. Paule's getting fresh eggs. Not necessary. Why the hurry to leave? I have to. Why don't you gather your strength first? Thank you. I could use some help around here. My wife and son were killed in a bombing raid on Hagen. Elisabeth was seven months pregnant. But Lottchen survived. Neighbors wrote to me that they've taken her in. I have to get to her immediately. At least put on some other clothes before you go out. Or they'll just hang you again on the next street corner. Elsa, there are people! In a truck! SS. - Same ones? - Yeah. Grab the bags. Krause, Niemann. Get the animals. Yes, sir. Come here, you feathery bastard. Nice chicky-chicky! Come on! Come here... Shit! What an idiot. Chicky-chicken! Come on! - Just catch the fucking chicken, Niemann! - Come on! I need help! You've got this. What do you want? I'm rounding up provisions for my troop. Do you have a problem with that? Excellent, Niemann! You chicken thief! - You don't even know how to pick 'em up. - Not everything. We need to live too. You're a feisty one, huh? Paule. Why are they killing our animals? They're not allowed. Don't worry. They'll be gone in a minute. Oh. I thought vermin of your kind were eradicated. You're not allowed to kill our animals! Shut up, moron. I'm not a moron! Who else lives here? Nobody. Just my brother and I. Hmm. So why are there three cups? My brother doesn't like to drink from the same cup twice. So he is a moron. I fucking hate this fake coffee. What I wouldn't give for some real coffee. You got a man? - My fiancé is at war. - Oh yeah? When did he last write you? Long time ago, huh? He won't be back. You and I know that. He's a pretty boy. But he's worm food by now. Give it back. Come get it. Elsa! Come on, throw him out! You're a liar. Stay outside, you parasite. Oh, no, no, no, no! Shut up. Ah! Shit! Don't just stand there, you idiot! - Hold the little slut down! - Dörfler, you can't do that. Hold her! There we go. - Let go of me, you pig! - You two, stop it, please. Come on, when was the last time you got to fuck? It's my turn first, then you. - We're not the fucking Red Army! - Shut the fuck up, limp dick! If this gets out, we'll all get shot. If this gets out, then I'll shoot you! Here. Just imagine it's your husband. Now, off with those clothes. Ah! Hey! - Uh... - What's going on in there? Ah! Oh! Fuck! Shit! Paule. It's okay. It's okay, Paule. Thanks for the clothes. Those assholes were vacationing in Sonnenberg. His name was Hans. We'd known each other since childhood. We have to go. We have to take Rita with us! We can't. We can spend the night here. What's wrong? We have to go back. We can't go back. But I have to milk Rita. Or else she'll scream. - Forget about that stupid cow! - Rita isn't stupid. She's having a baby. They wanted to kill us, don't you get that? There. That was the last stitch. How could the private have survived? No idea. The farm girl must have cut him from that tree. - I still have to bandage you. - Oh, kiss my ass. - Are you injured anywhere else? - No. Oh! Don't worry. I'll go back to that fucking farm first thing in the morning. So you can watch him escape a third time? I'll get that bastard. Come on, Paule, you have to eat something. Get some rest. Everything all right? Paule misses his cow. I meant, how are you doing? Everything's all right. Thanks. I've only seen my daughter once since she was born. She basically doesn't know who I am. Maybe she's better off without me. Are you kidding? You ran for weeks, and now you're backing out? Why did I cut you down from that tree? I risked my life for you. Hey. Your daughter is the reason you're still alive. I'm sure you're a good father. Elsa? Everything's okay, Paule. What are you doing? Nothing. Go to sleep. Good morning. Good morning. Are you still sitting there? I closed my eyes for a bit. Blinked or what? Have you heard from Paule yet? Not yet. Paule? Where's my coffee? Paule? Shit. Uh-oh. We have to move quickly, Rita. Look at him. Would you look at that moron? Where are they, huh? Where is the private? I made them disappear. Moron. You could kill him, Dörfler. He still won't talk. Rita! - Rita! - Let's get that heifer on the truck. And also the cow. - Rita! - We'll have goulash tonight! Rita... Rita... Paule! We'll get him out. We searched everywhere. Turned over every stone. There's no gold. - Bring me the mayor immediately. - Yes, sir. Have you found the gold? What's that? The farm girl's brother. And? No trace of him. Lieutenant Colonel... Lieutenant Colonel. - How may I be of assistance? - Where's the gold? Gold? The Jew. Löwenstein wanted to buy his way out. - From the camps. - I don't know anything about that. We know that the Jew hid a box with 31 bars inside this house. All residents of this dump to the village square. Twelve o'clock sharp. I AM UNWORTHY OF LIFE Ready? - Sieg... - Heil! Don't look over there. Come on. This way. In the name of God, stop! Unworthy to live? No life is unworthy to live! You will stand aside. Your Jesus, preacher, was only the son of a Jewish whore, and he won't protect you. What are they going to do? - Is there another entrance? - This way. You there, in the house. Get out! - To the marketplace! - Elsa? - The SS has Paule. - Come on, hurry up. What's going on? Come with us. Hurry up! You can knot a gallows, right? Let's see if the head tears off, or if he dangles. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you... the Hunchback of Sonnenberg! The Hunchback had a hump, you moron! Come on. Unworthy to live? I'll show you who's unworthy to live! Move! Find another spot! Move! They took Paule to the top. Don't leave me behind here! My rifle! Come on, Köhler, show us how much you learned at fucking Napola. Come on, move! That's right! Who's the moron now, huh? Paule! - Paule! - Elsa? No! Paule! Paule... We have to go. I'll take him. Tell me where the Jew's gold is, or I start shooting people, one after the other, until you tell me where it is! Please, don't! - I'll start with your brat of a son! - Elsa. - No, please, please don't! - Please, don't! Elsa. Elsa, don't... Don't shoot! Private! Come on, you bastards! He ran upstairs. Let's go inside. - Yes, sir! - Now! Come on! Kill him! Watch out! - Shit, I can't hear anything! - Come on, let's go. - What about Schröder? - Let's go! Private! Private! - Come on, weapons! - Yes, sir! Private! What's wrong, no more ammo? He's trapped. Go get that bastard! Move your fat ass, you fuckin' coward. Can you see him anywhere? Shit! Go to hell! Oh shit! He's in the house! Go get him! Hello, Private. Private! Take cover! Come on! Everyone get over here! Move, you lazy fuckers! You two go that way! You're with me! Check under every stone. That cockroach has to be somewhere. - Oh my God. - We searched the cross street. - He's not there. - Sh! - Seal off the streets. - Yes, sir. So he can't escape across the fields. - You, come with me. - Yes, sir. There. I hope that'll keep for a while. Thank you. Are you a soldier? I was a soldier. My sons. Friedhelm fell in Italy, Peter in Stalingrad. Irmgard? Please, wait. Where were you? I've been looking for you. What happened? This is Heinrich. He wanted to help Elsa free her brother. I buried Paule. What about Elsa? The SS took her to the inn. Stop. Stop! It's best to not strain your leg for the moment. It can start bleeding again at any time. You need to rest for now. Do you know why the SS are here? Gold. They're here because of the gold. They're serious. We're in a difficult position. Hmm. You saw them. They're going to shoot everyone. So what are we going to do? You're crazy. I didn't do all that just to lose everything now. Robert. The war will be over soon. And then we're rich. They wanted to shoot my son. - We no longer have the upper hand. - Robert, just wait! You'll keep your mouth shut, understand? - You don't understand. You have no family. - Come back here! Robert! Stay here! - Keep your mouth shut! - Robert, we'll get it done! It's over. What was that all about, hmm? Playing cowboys and Indians without little Sonja? Just like old times, when I was never allowed to join? Don't let him suffer for so long. - Give me that. - Hmm? Please! Wilhelm! There. Now what? Now we get the gold. The Americans have been seen near the outskirts of the capital. Now, Berlin has become a frontline city. Defenders of Berlin, know that the eyes of your wives, of your mothers, and of your children are upon you. Why aren't you eating? The meat is so tender. Surely that was a happy cow. - Hofer. - Yes, sir. Take this away. Wait there. This too. You don't need to be afraid of me now. You know, you remind me of a girl I knew once. I loved her very much. But she couldn't become my wife. Rebecca was a Jew. I couldn't stay with her or marry her. So I shot her. I didn't want her to be sent to a camp. I wanted it to be... quick. But I'll make up for it. I will never leave you. I will forever protect you. Come with me... Rebecca... The Löwensteins were the only Jewish family in the village. They were such lovely people. The change happened so suddenly. The mayor was the loudest by far at the community meetings. He said we had to "fulfill our duty as National Socialists." That there was no place for "Jewish vermin" here. ...calling for war on the German people. Shooting down German officials! - That's right! - That's why I say we need to avenge Rath! Avenge Rath! And in the fall of '38, shortly before the November pogrom... their oldest son Johannes came back to the village. He lived in Essen. He had married into a wealthy merchant family there, and taken over the company. Then came Kristallnacht. - Get outta here! - Come on, get out. Your stench has defiled our town for long enough! Your town? My ancestors helped build your town. Have you forgotten already, Mr. Robert Schlick? - I don't understand. - Go! - Get out of town! - What could we have done to cause this? You, you murdered Jesus! - What? - You're vile! Vile! Since when do you care about the Lord, Wilhelm Reinkober? I haven't seen you in church for years. I care about the well-being of the German people. That's right! Jews must all die! Johannes was sure that they faced certain doom as Jews in Germany. He and his wife sold the company, and wanted to emigrate to Palestine together with the Löwensteins. But... his parents didn't want to go. They refused. This was their home. They were Germans. Jewish whore! Elvira! Have you gone mad? What are you doing? - Die, Jew, die! - Get out of here, Jewish whore! The gold must have come from the sale of the company. The angry mob didn't notice it. Except Sonja. And those other scoundrels. Come here, you! How could that happen? Have you ever experienced people in a blood rage? I've been in this war six years. I've experienced it myself. Die, you pigs! I was paralyzed. I couldn't believe that this was really happening. No one ever spoke of that night again. It's as though it never happened. As though the Löwensteins had never existed. Rumor was that Johannes Löwenstein and his wife had been arrested on their way to Palestine before they could set sail. That would explain why the SS have left no stone unturned in the Löwenstein ruin. And the gold? Reinkober, the mayor and Wirtz had hidden it. They probably wanted to wait a while. And then the war came. And now the SS will get the gold. No. They won't. You can't be serious. That... It's not... Where is it? What is it? Do you really think one of us took it? So tell me. Robert. It could only be Robert. And now he's dead. Where is the gold? You're seeing ghosts, Sonja. Is she, Wirtz? I'm curious. Where did you get the money to repair your roof? You're siding with her now? What is this? I think you've got it. Oh, stay away from me, you low-down dog! Shut up, you damn cripple! You stupid clown. Gimme back my leg! Wait a second. I see something! What is it? Is it the gold? "Thou shalt not steal." "Thou shalt not kill." The goddamn preacher. Where's the gold now? In the church. We just couldn't let the murderers get the gold. Show me where the gold is. What's your plan? We'll give the SS what they want. If people knew what they've been praying in front of all this time... What are you doing down there? The ring slipped off my finger. It's a little too big. We'll adjust it. - Did you mean what you said? - What? That you'll always protect me? Till the end of our days. Thank you. What have you done, girl? I loved my brother, you bastard. Okay, so we'll sleep on it, then? No way. We'll drag the preacher out of bed. Not necessary. Don't kill him this time. We still need him. Ah, he's a tough one. Right, Father? Here you go. - Here. - Thanks. Shit. The Yanks have broken through the entire frontline. - They'll be here in a matter of hours. - We're not leaving the gold. The war is lost, you know that as well as I do. What do you want me to do? That madman in the chimney sweep costume... Get down! Hey, you in there! That goddamn private. - What do you want? - The girl. You can have the gold in return. He has the gold. No shit. I'll get her, Private! Hurry up! Lieutenant Colonel! Lieutenant Colonel! Lieutenant, are you there? The runaway's here. He has the gold! Lieutenant Colonel, sir? What's going on? Shit. Where's von Starnfeld? That fucking coward ate his cyanide capsule. After preaching final victory to us. - What an asshole. And the girl? - The girl is missing. So now what? Well, now I'm in charge. Where's the girl? She's with me! I'm bringing her out now! Stop! - You, stay right where you are. - Go on, fuck off, farm girl. Faster, Elsa. Hurry up! What are you doing? Take the jacket off. Get down! Braun! What's he doing? No idea. Cover me, now. Understood. Oh, thank God! Where's Heinrich? - Why? - He wanted to buy your freedom. I heard an explosion. And gunshots. I have to go back. Wait. Come with me. Who do you think shot them all? Ten-pointers, 12-pointers. I've had... everything on the end of the barrel. It gets dangerous when you only wound the animal. That's when you need the hunting cutlery, and get up close. Once, in Nimmertal, a wounded boar came right at me. - I stopped him with this. - I'd love to hear the story. But first, we've got some Nazi pigs to hunt. Where's the gold? Whatever happened to that wonderful little girl? The one I baptized? "Thou shalt not steal"? Start talking, you dirty thief! Did you hear the bang? What was that? Use the pickax on his knee. Sonja, please stop. - His screams will wake the whole village. - Do what you want. Maybe we should go to Irmgard. I know you share a bed with the widow. Whatever happened to being celibate? They're bandaging him. Well, let's not call off the hunt because of that. "Dear Heinrich. "It's very painful to write you these words." "Lisbeth and Karl did not survive the attack." "They were... they were buried in the cellar." "But Lotte is alive and well." "We took her in." "Take care of yourself." "Grete." Breaks your heart, doesn't it? I've got tears in my eyes. Nice to have you back with us, Private. You're lucky you and I have the exact same blood type. Now show me where the gold is. Or else I go to Hagen. I'll find your brat, I can promise you. And then I'll drown that little brat in a bucket. And so... Where is the gold? - Show us where. - In the altar. The marble top can be moved. Go on, what are you waiting for? - Yes. - Yes. What was your plan? Hmm? Have a nice little life together with the widow? Not everyone is like you, Sonja. Don't be so righteous. Move it, Private. Don't act all tired. Off to the church we go. Wait. They're in for a surprise. Yes! The gold is here. What's that? Oh shit. What was that shit? No idea. Maybe the wrath of God. Good morning, preacher! And just in time for morning Mass! Holy shit. You two are some tricky sons of bitches. A booby trap? - Heinrich. - Elsa. Elsa, stop. Braun. Get a crate from the truck. Yes, sir! And you... come here. Maybe I'll visit your daughter after all. What do you think of that? Private. I can't hear you! Incoming! Phenomenal. Oh shit. Take cover! Damn... What was that? Who took that shot? Oh my God. Oh! Heinrich! Weapon! Ah, shit! You are nothing but a dirty whore. I told you, wounded boars are the most dangerous. Oh shit. No! Elsa. Elsa. Elsa. Elsa! Shit! Well, my two lovelies. Am I spoiling your wedding? Oh, Private. You're pretty dangerous after all. There, there. Oh! You want the gold? You can have it! Come on. This is London calling. Here is a news flash. The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. I'll repeat that. The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. Whoo! Bull's-eye! Hey, Sarge. Shouldn't we have fired a warning shot or something? I mean, the war is over. They would have surrendered, don't you think? What's the matter, Baker? You gonna get all weepy on me just 'cause a bunch of fuckin' Krauts got what they had comin' to 'em? - No, I'm just sayin'... - Shut up, Baker. Holy shit! Hey, Sarge? I gotta show you something. What is it? You gotta see this with your own eyes! Here's another one. The woman has gotta be swimming in gold. Well, I'll be damned. Shit! We'll have to report this, right? Oh, yeah. Or... maybe we don't. Good decision. Grab a couple of crates off that tank. Yes, sir! Start picking these bars up. Come on, get that one over there! - On the double! - We're rich! - Get the hell outta here! - Man, I'm lovin' Germany. It's the best place in the whole world! HAGEN, GERMANY Mr. Wahrlich? Heinrich? Grete, look who it is! It's Heinrich! Look, Lottchen. There's your father. Hello, Lottchen. Papa! Oh, Papa!
