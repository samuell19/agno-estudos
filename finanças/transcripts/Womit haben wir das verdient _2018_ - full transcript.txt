Don't use your spoon. You're not a baby. What is that? Tony, what's that? Vietnamese stew. Just great... Smells good. - Vietnamese stew? - Yes. Tony made it. What makes it Vietnamese? Pseudo-Vietnamese. Okay... Seriously? That's my bowl! This is mine! That is yours! Please! Watch my laptop. Thank you. Like a bunch of three year olds. Really? You're saving the computer? I'm saving my computer from your soup. Of course. WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO DESERVE THIS? Since Nina's apparently not showing, we can go, right? Would you like to say how you feel about it? No. That's typical. You could've said, "how nice that everything turned out okay". It's just great. Nina doesn't smoke weed anymore, she's going to school. She's completely changed. I'll be right back. Yes, that's true. That is good news. Why didn't you say anything then? You sit around for 20 minutes, playing with this talky mouse and then... nada. Absolutely. My mistake. She'll just be dramatic. No bad energy. So, here we are again. What's going on here? Nothing, what's going on here for you? Well, that... Is this some kind of joke? Nina called me a couple of days ago and we decided that this is the best place to... You let him hold the mouse for 20 minutes, without telling us, that our daughter is... what? Maybe you'd like to explain the situation from your point of view? I converted to Islam. Alhamdulillah. Aha. What do you mean, "ah-ha?" Our 16 year-old daughter tells us, she's converted to Islam, starts dressing up like a bat and the only thing you have to say is "ah-ha?" You see? I told you straight away. So... Yes... What do you have to do? - You can do it all online. - Online? - You converted to Islam online? - Yes. You just need to say one sentence and have two witnesses. - What kind of sentence? - What kind of witnesses? Aschhadu an laa ilaha illa'Llah wa aschhadu anna Muhammadan rasulu'Llah. There is no god except for Allah and Mohammed is His prophet and messenger. At least she's learning Arabic... I would suggest that you all get a change of perspective. Let's change places and have the discussion from the other's perspective. You take your mother's perspective... Then take that thing off! Not happening. You can't be me with that thing on. I'm not supposed to be you, just to speak from your point of view. Correct. You take her father's point of view, so that of your ex-husband. This should be good. This is completely crazy. I raised you my entire life to be a feminist... - We. - Yes. We. I... There's a hidden camera somewhere... I suggest, that you see this all as her testing boundaries. - Some kids turn to drugs... - That's why we're here. I could get the drugs and skipping school. But to freely choose religious subjugation and to let someone else dictate, what you wear, what you eat... As a kid, I had to eat fruits and veg five times a day. I always said that that was nonsense. What exactly do you find so bad about this situation? - We consider religion... - ... to be nonsense. Oh, well. Our session is up, I'm afraid. I would like to suggest another appointment for next week... No! Can't you just convert to Catholicism? That'd be bad enough. And how will that help? No one will notice. Nina, that get up is really backwards. I mean there are plenty of Muslims who don't wear it. But I do. You wouldn't have taken my religion seriously without a hijab and abaya. Am I right? Should we bring something over tonight? No. It's fine. Can you let me out here? - Why? - I'll come over in a bit. Why? Where are you going? But please, don't come over tonight wearing... ... that! - Are you ashamed of me? - No. I am just asking you not to. As a birthday gift. I should disavow myself as your birthday present? Seriously? Nina, that isn't you. That's just some ideological bullshit. Yeah, yeah! I'm going! Can't you see that someone is getting out? Mom, don't get so upset. You'll get used to it. Inshallah Tony? Tony? You've reached Tony, here comes the tone. Why aren't you answering? And don't forget to bring the mousse au chocolat. Tony: I'll be there soon. With a surprise. I love you. Super, that you love me. Just great! But where are you? As-salam-alaikum! Many of you have been curious, how I've been since I converted to Islam. If you have any questions, just leave a comment. I'll gladly answer. I've been wearing the niqab for about 2 months and I am very happy. Even if the infidels don't like it, I don't care, because I don't like them either and we just don't get each other. I want to say... - Why aren't you answering? - Hello, mom! Did you call? Klara, it's you! No, I have... What? Oh, come on... Who cares. What's happening here? Klara! - Is everything okay with you? - Yes. Do we need to announce it today? What do you mean, "announce"? I'm 6 months pregnant. It's her birthday. I never understood, why we always celebrate that together. Because we are family. I am certainly not "family" with your ex-wife. Imagine that we weren't together anymore and I told you on your birthday, that I am having a baby with someone else. You wouldn't like that either. No. I'm sorry, can you speak up? I didn't quite follow that. Who should sit next to dad's woman? I don't care. Just don't put her too close to me. Happy birthday! You're the birthday girl? Yes, I am. I am very happy. Thank you, that I am here. Happy birthday! - Did she write back? - No, I just texted you. Why don't you ever answer me? Thanks. Give me that. That is Matthias. Elke is the woman I've always wanted, I just wanted to tell you all that. - Perfect. - Great. You're welcome. Where is our shelf? Isn't having it so open a bit unpractical? - No, it's great having it open. - Where's the old one? - Don't even think about it! - It's at Helga's. That was my mother's. You can't just give it to Helga. Darling? He's so sweet, you know? We ate a fish together in Trieste, and then he pulled out all the bones for me... - Where did you find him? - "Like me." What? Online. It's this online meet-up thing. - And how come you know it? - Klara showed me last week. Did Klara do something with her eyes? - Didn't I tell you about that? - No. With the money we gave her for the trip to Vietnam. Well, at least you can see it. Others get an expensive vulvar lip reduction. Which you then never see. That's true. You're right. Why are you leaving your shoes outside? That's how we do it. Okay, listen up. You asked for an iPad... I thought, maybe you don't have to wait until your birthday. All you have to do is taking those rags off. Mummy. No. Happy birthday. Alhamdulillah. You can sit across from each other, I even made those table cards. Allah the Merciful sent me here. Nina, you aren't sitting there. Yes, Nina converted to Islam. Online. You can really do it, I googled it. You're insane! You're racist! Is that serious or in jest? She has her phases, but they always seem to pass. Last year it was rabbit ears, this year it's Barbapapa. Right, Nina? My name is now Fatima. Just like Prophet Mohammed's favorite daughter. I wanted to be a nun at your age. Believing in something gives you strength. - Yeah, well. - What do you mean "yeah, well?" You are such a psycho. Can't you just be normal? Not everyone is as narrow-minded as you are! Maybe she fell in love, and he's Muslim and that's why? Yeah, maybe. You all think you're so feminist! But you cannot fathom that maybe I'm just doing this for myself? Well, I think it's important that you believe in something! Fatima. The Nazis also believed in "something." If your belief makes you think women need to cover their hair and body, to prevent men from having impure thoughts, then that's pretty suboptimal for the 21st century. Absolutely. I think it's hilarious that no one thinks that women ever have impure thoughts. Then you should really hide your six packs and behinds. Right, that is funny. I am Matthias, by the way, I am not allowed to extend my hand, right? Better if you don't. - How's everything at college? - Good. - What are you studying? - Law. Stop eating the salad! It's only a side! You don't have a drink yet. I don't feel right about drinking now. She's 16, they have their crazy ideas. They put on bunny ears or drink themselves in a coma. That I get, but finding religion as a form of rebellion? She leaves her shoes outside! Why didn't you adopt a second child, instead of producing this complete idiot? She'll be normal again soon. I am just tired of her always having to stand out! - I made her favorite roast. - Yes, sure. There is mousse au chocolat for you afterwards. Look, Wanda, Till and I brought a surprise guest. He was dying to come. I didn't want to come, I just wanted cake. - Cake? - Are we having it now? It's not my fault. Mom says a birthday without cake is sad. Happy birthday by the way. You were to bring mousse au chocolat! I am going to flip out. You're getting a cake for your birthday. What's the problem? The problem is that your ex-wife refuses to accept boundaries and you always cave in to her. And that mousse au chocolat is Klara's favorite dessert and that we don't have that now, because Helga thinks I need cake. That is the problem. And why are we having Klara's favorite dessert for your birthday? Is Nina dressed up as a ghost? Yes. Okay, got it. Come here. She just wants to get a rise out of you. Why didn't you call? Well, Franzi? You know that from home. Allah wants me to learn the meaning of true freedom. That freedom doesn't take place on the surface but in our personalities. You are great, how you are, and it doesn't matter how you look. My clothes are no longer about brands and stuff. I no longer wish to be an instrument of capitalism. - I think it's great. - I want to be accepted, how I am. I feel protected by Allah, the all Merciful. "Woman is a pearl, that we must protect." I read that somewhere. Beautiful. Where can you read that? Someone posted it, but clothing is a type of protection. Men also wear motorcycle helmets as a form of protection... How can you stand that? As long as he's good in the sack, he can say whatever he wants. Astaghfirullah, what is that? That is your favorite dish, if my information is correct. - Nina, please! - My name is Fatima. Until yesterday, you were Nina and ate everything. Yeah so? Should we throw the roast away in the name of Allah? No, I am vegetarian. I don't eat anything with eyes. Then give it to me. So no animals with eyes. Is that haram? No, but gummy bears for example are haram. What's with gummy bears? You shouldn't eat those, if you don't want to go to hell. Do I want to go to hell? It doesn't matter, if you want to, there is no such thing as hell. Really? Congrats! - For "hot nights"? - Yes, that's totally great. Look. Let me see. - Let's add a beard. - Or horns. It's a nice gimmick. It feels so good. - Here you go. - I don't drink alcohol. - Just to toast. - No. Six months ago, I picked her up in Flex totally hammered, and she told me that I was so old fashioned, for getting so upset, and then she puked in my car. Then you can be happy, that I no longer drink. But now you'd have a rag with you to wipe up your mess. What a bunch of crap. Here you go. Me too, non-alcoholic. We came by car. Sissy is driving. And a kiddie champagne. Dude, at home I always get the real stuff. You are as home here as you are at home. We are all one family. How grand that you were born, how we would have missed you so. How great that we're together, we wish you the very best, birthday girl. Thank you! - Cheers! - Cheers! - To you! - Cheers, cheers, cheers! Franzi! Seriously? I thought there would be mousse au chocolat. - Me too. - That's so typical. Can you explain that to her? There are gummy bears on it. We are all going to hell. We're going to take off soon. - Are you coming? - Absolutely. Absolutely! Tony? Till, can you give me a hand? Dude, that's what I am doing. Thanks, dude! You can take it off now, right? What? I cannot take it off when men are in the room. Seriously? For my sake you can take it off. Take off those goddamn rags! It's ridiculous! Stop! Enough! There is a solution for everything! Do not get involved! Nina? Keep it on. It looks great. May Allah grant you reason. That was the best birthday ever. Really? Maybe I should read her diary. Yeah, that turned out really well. I need to do something. Relax. I want to go to mom! Dude, that was obvious! Excellent, Franzi. Timing is everything. How grand that you were born, how we would have missed you so. Thank you, very nice. Thank you, for the cake as well. Great idea! Don't mention it. And if you ever want to talk about Nina, then give me a call. DE-RADICALISATION Yeah, Till texted me about it. He was really worried about it. We should all calm down a bit and take care of what we can. Good night! Sorry, I didn't want to get involved. We recently had this workshop. There were several at my school who converted. That's not as big of a deal as you might think. I cannot eat gummy bears anymore, dad. Yeah, they'll rot your teeth. And I'll go to hell! Because of haram. - Ciao. - Kisses. - Ciao. - Kisses! - Bye-bye. - Ciao! Ciao, ciao! Bye, everyone. Bye. Adios. Ciao, ciao, ciao! You like it more when I zigzag or as a serpent? I can do the hamster. Can't you hear that? The retard locked herself in the bath. Till, retard is not a foul name! Dude, do something. Please! What a bunch of crap here! Nina? What's going on in there? Are you not feeling well? - Are you alone? - Yes. Can't you all leave me alone? It's almost time for prayer, I don't have time for your shit! And you can only do that with your teeth brushed? No, but you have to ritually cleanse yourself before the prayer. Wudu. Wudu. - I have to go. - Can I come with? - Aren't you taking the bike? - It's probably haram. Yes, it is! I just read about it in a forum. Great. Nina? Nina? What is it? That won't be well received at school. Assam Aleykum. - "Wa-Aleykum As-Salam" you mean. - Don't try to missionize me! You are always doing that! With Klara you always spoke Vietnamese, although she didn't want to learn it. - Klara is Vietnamese! - Klara is Austrian! But Klara is from there and everyone sees it. And I am a Muslim and everyone sees it. As-salamu alaykum, sister. For four weeks now? Why don't you call? We get a letter from school for every little thing, but not for this? I didn't think that you didn't know that your daughter is wearing a headscarf. Everyone here knows that. Mr. Principal, sir! Quiet please! In a second! Come on, it's a great thing! What is? Excuse me, it is a political statement! What are you talking about? You know that right wing idiots tore off a girl's headscarf? The show of solidarity by female teachers and students? Why didn't the male teachers and students wear a scarf? Yeah, that would have been funny. But way too complex, no one would have understood it. It's absurd! The guys run around like normal while the girls have to cover themselves up. If you want to prohibit your daughter from wearing a scarf, you are welcome to. I think, as long as no one becomes a radical you should be able to wear what you want. Hey, baseball caps in the lockers! Dude! Dude! And you. Keep your head up! About time we went out and had a drink again. Let's do that! Heater's up and running, boss. - Great. - Thanks. There's a solution for everything. Bans are not one. So ladies and gentlemen! NOT IN OUR SCHOOL Good morning, Mr. Principal. What's the matter? Is everything okay? Could be better. Okay. Thanks. - Are you into Wudu? - Voodoo? - Not "Voodoo," "Wudu." - Voodoo? - No, Wudu. - That shaman thing? It's the cleansing before prayer. Aren't you Muslim? I am an Alevi, we do not have to cleanse ourselves. Then who performs Wudu? Not a clue, Sunnis, Shias, Wahhabis... I don't really know. They have seven million rules for everything. The more radical they are, the more rules they have. Depending on the religious crazy. Why? - Nina converted. - What? With Wudu, headscarf, dress. Everything. That's just... wow! And why? Don't know. For solidarity, or... ... coolness. Yeah, I know. Islam is totally in. The further things move to the right, the cooler Islam becomes. The youth have no clue about Islam, but know everything that's haram. "Brother, smoking is haram, drinking is haram." "iPhone is haram, Going out is haram." Just make sure she doesn't become radicalized. Pretty funny. I didn't even notice that she converted. ISLAMISM RIGHT WING RADICALISM Excuse me, ma'am. I am very sorry. Excuse me. - First time here? - Yes. - Son or daughter? - Daughter. I have a daughter, too. Nothing but problems. Is your daughter already married? No. She's only 16! Same as mine, also 16! Bye, see you next time. What's wrong with you? Give him your hand! - What is your goddamn problem? - It's okay. - Where are you going? - To see you. - You need an appointment. But it's an emergency. Nina. Nina Rath. With "Th." - Age? - 16. Look, It's common for them to explore themselves in puberty. Very few are ever radicalized. I find it all quite radical. She's wearing a veil. She no longer listens to music because it's haram. There's a watering can next to the toilet because toilet paper is haram. She has an app telling her what's halal. And yet: She's not going to end up in Syria overnight. Marriage is more likely. Oh god, that's worse. Look, no one really knows what's going through a 16 year-old's head. The girl from before for example: she was a devout Catholic, he is Muslim. The Salafists married her in the mosque so they could have sex. And then they kept going to the mosque, as a sign of gratitude, so to speak. We are not devout Catholics. We aren't religious either. We are none of the above. We're actually... ... great. Yes, great. Wonderful. Look, this one here. She's put together some bombs. Now she's a part of the bomb squad for the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces? What's important is that you all speak to each other. Laugh together, eat together. And if the kids don't want to eat something, because it's haram, then buy halal. It's all the same. It is not all the same. It is not the same. I don't want any part of this. I don't want to buy halal. I won't do it. Sorry. Can I help? Yes, I am looking for something halal. Everything is halal here, that's the whole point. Everything's halal, except for what's haram. Some things are makruh, that's something in between. Better not to do that too. Here you're on the safe side. Everything is certified. Like organic products. Okay? Okay! Hello! Hello. Did you also convert? I spoke to an expert. You should reach out to the youth wherever they are. Laugh, talk and eat together with them. That's the thing they want to do the most with us. Do you need to do that at the kitchen table? Yes, no, I... We stopped eating together, because it didn't work, if you remember. Yes... And that was wrong. Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Fine then. Are you making jellyfish there? Yes. Jellyfish. Great. You can't smoke weed here, Till. Can you raise Nina instead of me? Food's almost ready. - Perhaps you'd like to come in. - Is that an order? - A request! - Great. An invocation while staring in the mirror. "Save my face from the fires of hell." What can go wrong there? - Nina? - Wallah, no idea. Nina? Fatima! She's never going to remember. We're eating together tonight. - Why? - Wow. Where did you get all of that? From the mosque. There's this really cool flea market, nothing's for sale just in exchange. If you don't have any money, you just take what you need. You are welcome to eat here, Miriam. Wonderful, thanks... Her name is Maryam and she needs to go home. I bought everything halal. Allah will reward you. Thrilled to hear it. I would like to understand the headscarf and what not. Then Google it. And leave us alone. I will be over later. I don't know what it's like in Islam, but in our world it's like this: either you come over right now, or I'm turning off your internet. Got it? Wallah, I would really like to move out. Seriously. Is that the appetizer? - No. - No? - Main course. - Main course. Look. Halal gummy bears. Yes, good for you. It's all halal. What did they say about your headscarf at school? They all make stupid comments, etc. To be expected. The infidels. Allah the Merciful will forgive them. What's that? Okra. That's haram. Completely haram. By the way, today your principal said... Why do you go see the principal for every little thing? Sorry, but that is totally normal. No, it isn't. No one does such a thing. I am 16 and there's a freedom of religion. What? You have no idea what I want to say. That she should take off the robe or something. It's not that hard to figure out. May I be excused? - No. - Yes. Hello everyone! Hello. Do you want to eat with us? No thank you, I am about to leave. - Okay. - You didn't miss anything. Are you going to turn off her Internet? Why can't we just eat together in peace? Or are you anorexic now as well? Stop being so paranoid and leave me alone! I am your mother, I will never leave you alone! Did I really say that? I started off with the present today. I think, it'll be all good. What kind of present? For Harald and Sissy. That's totally getting on my nerves. And now the church too! But you aren't going to make a huge deal out of that too, are you? Sissy is Catholic. I'm not going to make a big deal. In the name of Allah: oh thank you, that I may use this bath. In the name of Allah... Will you need much longer? - No, come in. - I cannot be in a bathroom with men. Tony...? Now I touched you, sorry! Is that okay? Or not? Get out! Wudu is beauty and cleanliness. You have to say "Bismillahi-r." What does "Bismillahi-r" mean? "In the name of Allah." First your hands. Wash your hands. Wash them well, wash them well, wash them well... You don't always need to... Is he being serious? It's just some instruction. I got it online. There are thousands of them. And the women are always standing invisible in the background? Dude, no one cares about the picture. It really doesn't matter. Give me my cell. No, it does matter, Nina. It really does matter, that is the problem. That's what it's all about. ... So and now come over here... You are the problem! You're making a big deal out of everything! That's exactly what Tony just said! - I forgot someth... - Have you lost your mind? You can't just come in here. My purification is now voided. It's water. What can be voided about that? That's just how it is. Could you please accept this? Not so easy. Listen to me. You can pray here and have your faith, but this is our shared bathroom. I built this furniture and we are not living in Saudi Arabia! If you wish to move there when you turn 18, fine... - No, she cannot! - Yes, I can, because I'll be 18. Do you really think, she'd do it? We'll watch a documentary next week and that will be that. Hopefully! As long as you live in our apartment, stop being a pain in the arse! Okay? Thanks. ... Left head... Can't you say something? What should I say? He's completely right. He's not even my dad and he's talking to me like that. ... Now we are, with the steps now complete, but we need to say something. Super! Awesome! Thanks! Now I have to start over! Do you have a boyfriend? No. Nina! Why can't we talk to each other normally? I can yell at you all I want. I am your mother! You don't have a clue about life! Bye. Maryam, stay here! Just like my mom. - Let me tell you something! - No, I'll tell you something! I don't want your daughter having any contact with mine! I don't want my daughter having contact to yours! I refuse to allow Nina driving Maryam back to the middle ages! Putting on a scarf, just because a Muslim was spit on. Nonsense! They shouldn't have done that! They should have helped her take it off, instead of putting one on! It's all fun for your daughter. For mine it's a catastrophe. She should be studying and not ruining her future. We are in Vienna! You are the Muslims! For you, headscarves are normal! It's not normal it's anti-feminist! That's it exactly! Yes! What a bunch of nonsense! She doesn't want to be out alone. So she's getting my daughter involved. They don't want to swim anymore. What's next? Getting married and dropping out of school? Nina loves swimming! I've finished here. Bring your daughter to her senses. No contact. Is that clear? None! Until this is solved! Yes, that's okay... - Hello, doctor. - Hello. You'll feel a little prick, when you awake, it'll all be over. Excuse me, may I ask you something? Yes, of course, Mrs.... ... Petrovic. You'll be operating on me, correct? I'm just asking preventively, because you read so much about the Muhammadan. Mrs. Petrovic, Dr. Sarwad is a senior doctor just like me. Our schedule determines who operates, not religious affiliation or appearance, or anything else. Yes, I was just wondering. I can't believe it... It's okay. She's just scared. Yes, but of the wrong things! We removed half of her lung and she smokes 40 cigarettes a day, and she's afraid of you? Nina! - What are you doing here? - Picking you up. - I thought we'll have a bite to eat. - We aren't eating. What do you mean you aren't eating? We're eating after sundown. It's Ramadan. Okay, then... Ramadan. I am here with the car. Come on, it's cold. Your mother says, she needs you in the bakery. So I can't take you with. I don't care about her. What did you do? It's great that you are sticking up for this girl, but you are going way too far. Not going to swimming practice is out of the question! You love swimming! I hate swimming! I hate it when everyone stares at me. You loved our vacations to the nudist beaches in Croatia! - No, I did not! - Yes, you did. You went to a nudist beach? Really? You always said, we're Generation Porn and everything is ultra-sexualized. They want to take our clothes off, we want to put them back on! You went out and protested that women should decide about their bodies. But not for them to cover themselves just to keep men from getting horny. Dude, mom, please... We told our swimming teacher, "we'll swim, but in a burkini." She told us it wasn't allowed. That's all okay, but not a burkini? Where's the logic in that? Are you only allowed to swim if everyone can see everything? Like on "Germany's Next Top Model," Where everyone has to strip for them to have a personality? Something went awry from topless to whatever that is. But what? Do you prefer that one or the green one? I really don't have a preference. We've got that from the do-gooders. They should stay away if they can't intregate. Excuse me? Where should my daughter stay? Who's talking about your daughter? German! - Excuse me? - Whatever. I mean, do you see that? You know what I mean? If that happened to a woman from Syria. What if I were a refugee? But you aren't a refugee! May Allah the Merciful grant you wisdom. Yeah, right. As if! I don't believe it! Pretty strange that you sell burkinis here. Yes, but only recently. Shall I cancel it? No. No, I just wanted to say that I find it odd. Yes, in a way. That's what's being bought now, it's fashionable now. Fashion? It's a form of patriarchal oppression. Okay. Can you do anything without attracting attention? I'm attracting attention? You're attracting attention! - How much? - 107.99, please. Thank you. Your change. Thanks. - The receipt is in the bag. - Super, thanks. Enjoy. Thanks. It's not just about Islam. Without religion, there never would have been mobs burning witches. Never would have been a conflict in the Middle East, no 9/11, nothing. Blessed Mary, Mother of God, pray for our sins... If someone is delusional, it's called a mental illness. If a group is delusional, it's called religion. And in its name they are permitted to terrorize others legally. Especially women. Like here. They locked a woman in a box! Animals have a soul! It's a protest against fur, mother. Do you have two euros? Yeah, sure. Here. Thank you. During Ramadan, you're supposed to perform one good deed a day. I wanted to talk to you about this Ramadan. The girls can't be meant to go all day without eating and drinking. I thought, we'd team up and I'd take care of the medical declaration. We're Muslims and observe Ramadan. I don't want my daughter wearing a headscarf, that's all. Okay... But I didn't... I thought you also don't approve. I've been doing it my entire life and have never had problems. Okay. I'm not sure if it was a good idea but the girls are swimming again. I bought them burkinis. You have an issue with Ramadan but buy burkinis? You really are surfing the wrong sites. And your daughter too. She's surfing the most extreme sites. Come back tomorrow. I'll take you to the mosque to break the fast. Nina, do you really want to wear that? I am absolutely certain. No guys are going to be there, it's just for girls. And the lifeguard? Dude, he's gay. Everyone knows that. If we wear that, Ayse can come swimming too. Can you ask? Human rights, dude. Ayse? You being funny? She's not allowed to swim. Her father sued the city of Vienna or the school or the government for it. Didn't you hear about that? It was in the paper. I couldn't care less what was in the paper. I'm putting it on. Go ahead. Your call. What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? Don't tell mom! What are you talking about? Yeah, that I eat pork... She won't bother. She wasn't the one who converted. Yeah, but she'll surely make her comments, that I won't see it through. But you won't through. Oh Allah, please grant me Your forgiveness! Come on, it's not that bad. It's not my fault. Hey, Nina! Nina. There is a solution for everything. Her blood sugar is low, that's why she's like that. She's not all there, that's why she's like that! Mother and daughter go to the zoo together and look at the camels. The daughter says: "Do camels also get married?" The mother says: "Only." I don't get it. Only camels marry! You don't have to do everything. A colleague told me today, that you can buy out of Ramadan. With a donation. He is also Muslim. I could do that for you. Look, mom, Ramadan is not about buying yourself out of it. It's about developing empathy for the plight of others, who are so poor, that they cannot afford food. I mean... Paradise is just so much better than life here. You cannot fathom it. To be granted entry you must pass a series of tests. These tests include wearing a headscarf, fasting and following all these rules. I want to pass and I am going to pass. I heard a great joke today. A dark-haired, a brunette and a blond mother all have daughters in puberty. Mom, please. It's probably some old fogey joke. It's really a good one. - It's a good one, isn't it? - It's great. My colleague told it to me. Do we need a headscarf in the mosque? It's Ramadan. Everyone will be wearing one, but you do not need to. The majority of Muslim women in the world do not wear one. You just don't notice them. Women's room is in the back. Please put your shoes... I know! You take care of yourself. Oh my god! Welcome, how are you? Good, thank you. And you are well, too? Very good, thanks. What brings you here? Um, I am here... I... I... Her daughter converted to Islam. She is curious and we wanted to look around. God's will has come to pass. You raised your daughter well, sister. Praise be to Allah! We have such a great deal of respect for you! Your daughter is above us. We were born Muslim, but she decided to convert freely. Some rose water for the mother of the converted? Thank you. - What is your daughter's name? - Nina. Nina? Oh, well. Now her name is Fatima. Ah, Fatima. Fatma, the Prophet's favorite daughter. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon Him. This is my son. Introduce yourself. Hi, I am Can, I was born here and I... ... attend the technical institute. What else? Go ahead and talk. What else do you do? I love sports and... I like going out... ... and I love musicals. Musicals, really? Please, take one. Take one. Or are you observing Ramadan? No. I am actually not religious. Well, you'll come around. We'll show you around. We are the committee. Come. Right foot first. Just kidding. Please. Why are we allowed to be in the male prayer room? The women aren't allowed in front of the men. Makes sense, right? Makes sense. There's a lot going on in the women's room right now, in the Fiqh class. You can show her, sister. Yes, of course. Sister, what's wrong? The headscarf? Hurry up. We are already hungry. What are you looking at? "Fikhi"? Fiqh. It's a class for marriage and raising children. About how a female believer should behave. What's correct and what is not. Appropriate name. Do you get it, sisters? Next time with headscarf. If a woman menstruates before sundown, then the fasting is no longer valid and it must be repeated after Ramadan. If the menstruation comes during prayer, then the prayer is no longer valid and the woman must cleanse herself. If she is clean, then she may hold the Noble Quran. If women insert tampons and touch themselves, then they are damned. The Holy Prophet, may God's peace and blessings be upon Him, says: A woman who hides the beginning and end of her menstruation from her husband, is cursed. Unnatural intercourse is also prohibited, during the menstruation takes place, otherwise the Sheitan is there. And if intercourse takes place between a man and a man or a woman and a woman, it is haram. Because that spreads diseases like tumors and AIDS. But that is a different matter. Today, angels are visiting us. They are blessing this room, they are blessing us, because we have gathered here today to be worthy of Allah's will. Allah, bless us. We shall meet again next week, sisters. Where's the respect? No headscarf? I don't get it either. If you can smell a girl's perfume, it's the same as if you fucked her. Stop it, dude. Yes, dude, it's haram! When I was 12, my mother gave me a pad and a headscarf... I think the Imam is flirting with me. Don't take it personally, he flirts with everyone. Tell the joke your colleague told you. A dark-haired, a brunette and a blond mother all have daughters in puberty. The dark-haired mother says: "I found my daughter's whiskey and I didn't know that she even drank." The brunette mother says: "I found my daughter's cannabis and I didn't know that she even smoked." The blond mother says: "I found my daughter's condoms. I didn't know that she even had a penis." It's a good one, isn't it? What are you doing? You said everyone is welcome in the mosque. Yes, everyone is! Except you. How are you speaking to your mother? Oh my god. Have some respect! She carried you for nine months. Behave yourself! It's really okay. No! I ask Allah the Merciful for forgiveness. Paradise lies beneath the feet of the mothers. I am truly very sorry. Nina, please act normally. It's a good thing! Good girl. Thanks be to Allah! The whole respect thing for your parents is too much. Careful, sister, that is haram, what you are saying. Especially during Ramadan. Tight snap from the club last night. I shouldn't have posted it. Now I have to get married. What kind of nonsense is that? Some damn idiot sent it to my father. He didn't say a word about the picture, just that he was going to arrange something. I am certain that it's because of that. You have to get married because you're gay? Where's the logic in that? There are places where they kill you for that. All I have to do is get married. To whom? No idea. He spoke to Emre about a cousin or something. Just go talk to your parents. You'll find a solution. Allah made you how you are and He does not want you to be unhappy. Your parents also have to accept you for you. You're funny. There's a solution for everything. God, now I sound like my mother. Yalla, that's haram, what you're doing. Especially during Ramadan. And what about you? I see that your headscarf isn't on straight. Pay more attention. Siktir lan, dude! - Doesn't dare to smoke in front of us. - No. Wash and wash and wash your hands. We don't always have to do it three times. Once is enough. But when we have the time, we can repeat three... Please don't. ... no time, we are in a hurry, and why are we in a hurry? For example, the imam is beginning to pray. Then we don't have time. Good night. Or if there is not enough water. What do we do then? Like this. Afterwards we rinse out our mouth. Let's toast to our Sissy. To our new member of our great big Christian community: To our Harald, whose life up to now, I don't want to say it was in vain, but it was an empty wasteland. Without the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Cheers, dear friends! Kisses! May Allah also bless this union! Very important! Harald used to prohibit Christmas and advents wreathes in our flat share... - We couldn't do anything! - Too Catholic, and now... - Cheers! - Thank you for everything. You pose in front of the camera like you're in a zoo. You're jealous, that you're no longer the center of attention. Take your headscarf off and no one will notice you. I can't take anything off. And that makes you better than me? That's what you think. When you were four you taped your eyes like mine to get attention. Now you've done it, bravo. Who wants to be like everyone else? I do, dummy. Come on, let's dance! Fatima! You're cool with that, aren't you? I think the wedding is great! I find it horrible, but don't tell anyone. The gifts are also terrible. Most of them, yes. Except for mine. Yes, but I don't know, where I should hang it up. It's a floor lamp. Hey, if this doesn't work out... You can always move to ours even if the baby is there. Are you suggesting to my daughter that she moves in with you? Stop getting involved! What's the matter? All thumbs up! I'm for all kids moving out. Where would she sleep? We don't have any room. Have a glass of water for a change, okay? You need to put a stop to that. I can't. A baby and a female Islamist going through puberty, how can I do that? Your ex-wife says something at our wedding and you're coming after me now? Are you retarded? Retard is not a foul name. That is my flat! I let whoever I want live with me including your daughter! But you know what? She's more than welcome to get married so she can move out. Sorry, that just came out. Why "sorry?" Getting married! How dumb can you be? Excuse me? What? What was that? What? I knew this was all about a guy. It doesn't concern you what I do with my life. No skin off my back, I'd get your room. No, that's going to be my workshop. Please, could you say something? Why did you tell Sissy but not me? That's not the most important issue here. That's nonsense, right? You are not legally allowed to marry at 16 in Austria. Yes, of course. You can in the Mosque. You just need two witnesses. Against the wishes of the parents, because we are infidels. Right, I saw that in a documentary. How long have you know him? Three weeks? You have no clue! It's an act of friendship and a statement against homophobia! You are only against it because he's Muslim! Otherwise, no one would have an issue. If he weren't Muslim, you wouldn't be marrying. Absolutely. You have no clue! You always act like you know me! Can you please stop involving yourself in my life! Marriage is not an act of friendship. Marriage is... Marriage is meaningless, you always said that. Yes, marriage is meaningless... Marriage is meaningless? Interesting! Sissy, please! What do you mean "please?" What are you doing, mom? I am doing what I want. You do what you want. Starting now, no one will involve themselves in the other's life. Fine. Dude, it's not my fault. Actually, I don't think there is a solution for everything. You can do it not to involve! Just let her live her life without getting involved. What's the worst that could happen? Even... ... if she dropped out of school and had a child. Then she'd get a divorce and she'd get her degree at night school. What? Just hypothetically. Go to sleep. What does that mean? Here are some of your childhood things for your wedding. Perhaps you'd like to show them to your husband. What do you think about her marriage? Great, isn't it? Are you really going through with that? What's your problem now? You're such a radical believer and you're having a fake wedding? I am doing this for a good cause. It will help me get to paradise. But you can't just get married on a whim, that's not how it works. That family is very religious. You can't possibly imagine it. It doesn't matter. I live with Can in a flat that they all pay for. I have space from my parents and he has space from his. I cannot believe how naive you are. You don't notice what is going on around you. You're now the "Uber-expert" again because you're a real Muslim. You know, how annoying that is? I am just as much a Muslim as you are! Even a better one, because I observe all the rules. You are just showing off, that's it. When is this wedding going down? On Monday at 11 is Nikah. I will meet with Can and we'll discuss the terms. So you're not coming now? To the presentation on intersectional feminism? Fuck, I completely forgot about it! I come a bit later, okay? I'll try. Bye. Bye! What a bunch of shit! I wrote down the questions from the Internet. Are you following Quran and sunna? Fine. Do you know Ashure? Ashure? Do you know the story of Prophet Nuh? - Nuh? - Noah. They got lost somehow and missed the island or something. Something happened with a boat. I can't remember. They then made a meal using everything they had. Grapes, beans, apricots, raisins... What else? Chickpeas, wheat, rice... In the end, it is really tasty. Okay? Yeah? Got it? Yes, I mean, what can be so difficult about it? Okay. Moving on Will you do hajj with me? Perfect. And five kids? But you are gay! Yes, that's why I need so many plus points to get to paradise. It will give you a bunch of plus points as well. You'll go to school through the end of the month. You wont need it any longer. I don't think. What? MARRIAGE NINA 11 o'clock Patient Mayer Yussuf, 52 years old is being operated on. He has a biopsy-confirmed carcinoma in the proximal sigmoid colon. The plan is to perform a hemicolectomy... - Is something wrong? - No. Are you sure? We are prioritizing the colon carcinoma for the reasons discussed, as we do not need to discuss how Wanda performs the appendectomy. Excuse me, what's that? Since when am I doing the appendix? He just said that the patient prefers being operated on by a male colleague. By a male colleague? Why? He does not want to be operated on by a woman. The opposite happens often as well. And we're all accepting this? I am not causing all sorts of problems because of that. If we don't, the paper tomorrow will say we're racists. If he doesn't want you to operate on him then relax. Just ignore it. And if someone else doesn't want you to operate on them, because you're a Muslim, we're just going to accept that too? That's not the same thing. Does she have her period, or what? Seriously? Yeah, is that funny? Okay, you know what? You can operate on that appendix yourselves. Wanda! Back to the colon carcinoma. We cannot prevent the wedding, but we have to be there. I can't just leave the pregnancy workout. Now go please. We'll see each other at the workout debrief. Absolutely. - Kisses. - Kisses. Kisses. Kisses. - What are we doing there? - Hiding our charms. Nina doesn't want us to get involved, so... ... we'll stay hidden. Top, super. You look great in that, sister. And this is great for underneath! Out of the question. It looks great! Aren't you happy? Come on! We're running out of time. You are a blessed man! You have a woman, who only belongs to you! It's a nightmare. Excuse me! - Harald? - Who else? It's the worst moment of my life. That's not for men, only for women! Well hello. Get lost! Where do we need to go? To the right. Shit! Can you steer? I am stuck! Steer! A little help here! Take your foot out of there! What a bunch of shit! Dude! POLICE Just a second. Shit. Forgot my driver's license. But you just had to drive! Let me speak. At the seminar they said they wouldn't speak with men. Driver's license and registration, please. Are you crazy? You are Dr. Wanda Rath? You live in 1070 Vienna? Surgeon? Question: How do you operate with those rags? That cannot be allowed, can it? You always have to recognize the doctor. That's not up for debate. Dr. Rath, please expose your face. That was obvious! So. Get out. Both of you. Now! Blow into here firmly, Doctor. Are you going to a Carnival party? No, to our daughter's wedding. We are in quite a hurry! 0.0. Okay, there's still the matter of the ban on face covering. Is that 150 for men as well? Yes, I believe so. Otherwise we'd have problems with the equal opportunities officer. If you were going to a Carneval party, it would be easier for all of us. Carneval! Wrong door! Where is it? Where's the entrance? - Hold up! - What's the matter? Look! Something's amiss with Nina. She locked herself in the bathroom. Can you come? Is she still in there? Yes, but she's not saying anything. Nina, I'm here now! - We are. - We are here now. Please open up! Will you say anything? Nina, we are here now! Stop taking pictures! Nina, I am coming in now. Nina, I am opening the door! Dude! Many people die because the fire department can't get into the rooms. It's a safety measure. Nina? Okay. I didn't marry him. They always say, it's important how you are on the inside, and then they are constantly telling you, how you need to be. We wouldn't have got a flat. We would have lived with them. In his childhood bedroom! He can go and marry his stupid cousin. I don't care! She runs around Vienna in a niqab and Can doesn't say a thing. We are so incredibly proud of you. Absolutely. But don't think, I'll take off the headscarf. I am going to stick with it until they understand what Islam really means. Humans being stupid is not Allah's fault. Except for the fact that he doesn't exist, you are totally right. I now know what I'm doing. I'll organize a demonstration. Islam reform 4.0. You have to help me! Yes, that... well... You should maybe give it some more... - That's not a good idea. - Yes. It needs to come from within. They have to do it themselves. Islam reform is not... - We're not doing this! - It's not up for debate. - Yes it is. - No! What's reformative about bike riding? - You should be allowed to. - And who isn't? In Saudi Arabia or something. Okay, there, but... Hashtag #whynot, please. You can leave if you don't like it. - Do you hear it? - I am not protesting to ride a bike. Vienna stays Vienna...! ALLAH IS A WOMAN What a ridiculous sign, dude. What is ridiculous about it? It's feminism! Her mom carried that at a protest once, silly head! When God created man, she was just practicing. Keep it down! We are discussing something here! It's not feminism, it's religion. It's a pure provocation. Typical Austrian, dude! What are you talking about? I'm from Austria too. Yeah, born here. She's Austrian by culture. What is Austrian culture in your opinion? That there? Vienna stays Vienna! Let it go, sister. Let her carry her stupid sign. Free speech. Through thick and thin, and tougher times We'll fight for feminism all the time Through thick and thin, and tougher times We'll fight for feminism all the time. Through thick and thin, and tougher times We'll fight for feminism all the time There will be turmoil in the mosque. I think so, too. We live in a country, where there's freedom of speech and freedom of religion. It's a privilege! Compared to so many countries, where so much is banned and where you can't stand up for yourself. We want to wear what we want! Yes! But we don't want to be divided into honorable and dishonorable women. But that's exactly what the headscarf does! Home, Freedom, Tradition, Diversity, Enough! Fucking Nazis. No one should have to marry because they are gay or are a girl. What a demand! Vienna in the 21st century! Yalla, Habibi! What's your problem? The Sheitan is speaking through you! Better put on a headscarf and marry me! Keep quiet, sucker! If the Imam were to see it... Excuse me, is this the protest against the full-body veil ban? No that was yesterday. You are too late, that was yesterday. - Shit, that's what I said! - Doesn't matter. - What protest is that here? - Islam reform. Islam reform! But you are for it! We are not for something, where there are so many women. Exactly! Women in the kitchen! Women in the kitchen! Anti gender insanity! Anti gender insanity! Anti gender insanity! Anti gender insanity... WE PROTECT EUROPE ALLAH IS A WOMAN I need the room. I need the kitchen table. No, you don't need it. You need a place for you. And we need a place for us where we can be us. But when you aren't here... Sitting at the table is too stiff. We need a place, where everyone can move around, be in the kitchen together, spend time with everyone... Can is not marrying his cousin. He's moving in with us. Come, I'll show you your room! Other kids take drugs, skip school... I know! That's why we're here! We are here in a loop... We're trapped in it! You already said that! The world keeps on spinning normally for us and you're going back to school and you'll get your degree eventually, and there is no German exit exam in Austria... Shit! We cannot stop the wedding, but we have to... Are you starting that again? If you were going to a Carneval, it would be easier for all of us. Carneval! That was new!
