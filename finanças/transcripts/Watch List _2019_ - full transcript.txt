In the summer of 2016, Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte launched a nationwide police operation to rid the country of drugs. This sparked a flood of extra-judicial killings of suspected drug offenders, some by the police and some by vigilantes. Estimates put the current number of murders at over 27,000. The following is based on true events. We fight against criminality and illegal drugs and corruption. We'll be relentless and sustained. We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financer and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars, or below the ground if they so wish. Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now there is three million drug addict. I'd be happy to slaughter them. WATCH LIST Let's go ! Move aside. - Tell us where these people live. - There, by the corner. - Make sure you tell us everything. - Yes. We'll take care of it. - Check that house. - Yes, sir. Open, police ! Even now I still get lost when I come here. Open the door. Just a second. Yes ? - Is Arturo Ramon there ? - Is there a problem ? That's up to you. Ma'am, we're here for your husband. Is he here ? - Yes, officer, can I help you ? - We're with Operation Tokhang. We'd like to invite you to the Barangay Hall to surrender. I don't understand. Surrender for what ? Multiple sources have identified you as a drug pusher. There must be some mistake. I don't know who you've been talking to, but I'm clean. Do you want to return to prison ? Just come with us already. - Sir, you got a wrong report. - Ma'am, I'm talking to your husband. And I'm telling you, my husband is clean. Quiet. What's your name ? Now hold on, I'm the one you came for. I'm not talking to you. What's your name ? Maria. You see a Maria Ramon on the list ? - Ah, here it is. - What ? Let me see that. Don't touch this. A family business. We quit years ago. Both of us did. So you admit to being users ? This is your one and only chance to surrender. Of course this is completely voluntary. Sir, we'll be right out. Your parents are smart people. Let's go. - Always gotta run your mouth. - They have no reason to harass us. Now they have. Mark, watch your brother and sisters. Good for you ! Get sober ! WELCOME TO OPERATION YOUR SECOND CHANCE Sir, I'm not a user. I don't care, just write down your name. I can't read. Just do as I say. Sir, where do I sign ? Name and address at the bottom. Why are you here ? I'm asking myself the same question, Hector. Fill this out. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. - I have surrendered voluntarily... - I have surrendered voluntarily... - Because I want to change my life. - Because I want to change my life. - I vow to stop... - I vow to stop... - All drug related activities. - All drug related activities. - Including buying... - Including buying... - Selling... - Selling... - And using. - And using. - Because I love my family... - Because I love my family... - And I love my country. - And I love my country. You may lower your hand. You have all been enrolled in a government sponsored rehabilitation program. If you go back to using, it will be reported. The road to recovery is long. But you've taken the first step. Congratulations. We prepared a small feast at the back. Enjoy. Congratulations to you ! WE SUPPORT DUTERTE Joel's little doggie. Just checking if you're awake, baby bro. I'm awake. Enjoying the dance party ? My parents are. Do they really think their lives will get better by dancing ? Sir, just for a while. Morning, uncle. - I thought you'd be out there with us. - Dancing is not my thing. Would sure give your mom some peace. My dad surrendered. Didn't give him peace. God bless Carlo. He's with the heavenly father now. Lucky him. He left us to rot in hell. Do you think I don't know what you've been up to, Joel ? Stop it. It doesn't end well. Trust me, I've been there myself. Will all due respect uncle, you don't know anything about me. The hell I don't, Joel. You have your whole life ahead. Be careful. They've got your number now. Joel ! Joel ! Take your siblings home. - But, dad... - Go ! What was that all about ? Your ten minutes are up. Take your medicine, Nina. Don't go, daddy. Daddy needs to work. God only helps those who work hard. - Right ? - Yeah. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Mark... I don't want you hanging out with Joel anymore. But, dad... I'm talking ! He's gonna get himself shot or arrested. I'm not out there busting my ass so you can get shot or arrested. Clear ? Yes, sir. You and your sister have to go farther than me and your mom. Keep your head down and study. Hey, don't stay out late. You haven't slept all week. Who needs sleep when you're around ? Go ahead. I'm off. Turo ! Your keys ! Maria ! Hector ? What is it ? Maria, come ! Quickly ! Hector ? Hector ? Hector ! What's happening ?! - Hector ? - Condolences, Maria. Ma'am, stay there ! - You can't enter the crime scene. - She's the wife. No ! What did they do to you ? Wake up ! Wake up ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Turo, wake up ! I'm begging you ! Turo, don't leave me ! Don't leave me, my love ! I'M A PUSHER DON'T BE LIKE ME He surrendered ! He surrendered ! What have you done ?! I just need to ask you a few questions. Let's talk in the corner when you're ready. - How many kids does he have ? - Three. You're right. He was registered as reformed. Then why did you still kill him ? It wasn't us. We're doing our best to find out who did this. We found five grams of meth in his pocket. That's impossible. Ma'am, think carefully. Does someone have a grudge against your husband ? My husband was no pusher. Two jobs, three kids, struggling to make ends meet... A man would do anything for his family. Wouldn't he ? If you think of anything that might be of help, don't be afraid to come to me. So he'd gone back to pushing. He was doing so well. If there were enough jobs for everyone then no one would be forced to do illegal things. It's the government's fault. Maria ? Grace. What will happen to me and my kids ? I asked myself the same question when they killed Carlo. How will I manage with six children on my own ? But somehow we find strength. Just keep faith in the Lord. You need to eat, mom. Or let's go get some air. My husband didn't do anything illegal. - Of course, dear. - You can go. - Leave ! - Apologies. Maria, calm down. Don't make a scene. Joel, pay your condolences to your auntie. Sorry, auntie. I know he didn't approve of me, but I had nothing but respect for him. They killed him just like that. He was defenseless. My husband couldn't defend himself. Say farewell to your father. You won't get another chance. Mark. I'm gonna start looking for a job. Just eat. I already have it figured out, I can work in construction like dad did. That's the last thing your father would want. - We have no money coming in ! - I'm figuring it out. Mom, was dad a pusher ? No. But they said that they have found drugs in his pocket. You can't believe everything you see on TV. But if he wasn't a pusher, why did they kill him ? Because he used to be. Shut your mouth. It's the truth, isn't it ? She may not remember, but I do ! Your father made mistakes. We both did. But we more than paid for them. Where do you think you're going ? Get back here and finish your dinner ! Sorry if it took a while. I'll need your signature here. This is your copy of the death certificate. And these are your husband's personal effects. I'm sorry for your loss. That's it ? As soon as we have anything, you'll be the first to know. There's still no news until now ? CCTV footage, witness, anything ? Apparently the cameras were down that night. Witness testimonies haven't been helpful either. Maybe you know something ? My husband was a good man. He wasn't perfect, but I know he was innocent. Maybe we can help each other. You want to find out what happened to your husband. I want to find out who the real criminals are. I just want peace. - That's a foul ! - An addict's son ! - Your father's a junkie. - Good thing your dad died. Hey ! What are you looking at ? - I wasn't sure you were still coming. - Had to put the kids to sleep. Promise this stays between us. I could get into trouble. - I promise. - Are you sure you want to see it ? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done this. Play it again. You'll only get hurt. Please, Hector. Play it again. There. Where ? There. Whoever lives there saw everything. You promised. - Thank you. - You're gonna get me in trouble ! - No, I won't. - Maria ! I didn't see anything. I only woke up when the police came. Please. He was the love of my life. My children's father. And they shot him like a dog in the street. You didn't hear any of this from me. I heard three shots so I went to the window. They stopped outside and got off the bike. Then... one of them made a call. The police showed up less than five minutes later. The vigilantes and the cops spoke like they knew each other. I found it very bizarre. You can't go by one witness account. Most of them are unreliable. Why is the police saying that vigilantes killed Turo if they're actually working together ? Maria, you want my advice ? Let it go. Asking questions only leads to more trouble. My kids ask me if their father was a junkie. And I can't look in their eyes because I don't know what truth is. I don't even know who killed Turo ! You may never know. You have to live with it. It could've been the cops. It could've been vigilantes. - But what's in it for the vigilantes ? - What do you think, Maria ? Protection. Money. This is a huge operation. Everyone's getting paid. Informers, assets. Some from this neighborhood even. They said Operation Tokhang gave users a second chance. But they just used it to create the drug watch list. They said if we surrendered, they wouldn't come after us. They lied. If you're on the list, you're a target. How do I get my name off the list ? Once you're on the list, it's impossible to get off. Fuck. Maria, stop focusing on the past. You're still in a lot of danger. Your kids are all that matter now. What does this look like ? A charity ? Ma'am Zita, all I'm asking for is an extension. If I allowed you, then I have to allow everyone. - Ma'am Zita, I promise we will pay. - And how will you do that ? Ma'am Zita, please. My husband passed away recently. That's another thing. I'm tired of you using my house as a drug den ! Turo wasn't involved in drugs. Not anymore. Once an addict, always an addict. Go fuck yourself. Excuse me ? I said, fuck you. Keep your piece of shit house. Mark, let's go. Let's get our things. Maria ! The former tenant left to the province to hide. That's why it's now vacant. You can set up your kitchen over here. Then, you can set up your bed here on the floor. I ran a power cable. You can plug your appliance there. You can also use our bathroom. - You want to just stay with us ? - We'll be okay here. Thank you, Grace. Don't thank me. We're family. Just be careful at night, ok ? There's lots of crazies running around here. If you need anything else, I'm just around the corner. It's not so bad. For a little while. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you know of any job openings here ? None here. Maybe in the next stall. Okay, thank you. Where else have you worked in the past three years ? Being a mother is a full time job. But I'm a very fast learner. - How many kids do you have ? - Three. What does your husband do ? Excuse me, sir ? Are you looking for a helper ? - Not now. Maybe next month. - Okay, sir. Thank you. He passed away. How did he die ? Accident. Wait here. Are you guys looking to hire ? Is that her ? She's the girl in the news, right ? I'm sorry. The position has been filled. - While you were talking to me ? - Good luck with your search. Run ! Police ! Mark, come back ! I'll be alright. Just stay inside. Mark ! Those four, on the other side. Go ! Faster ! Move ! Transfer them quickly ! Sir, what's going on ? - Look at them, indecently dressed ! - My kid is innocent. Let's go, Mark. Take her away, she's interrupting us ! He's not doing anything ! Transfer them to the other side ! Quick ! Search them ! Search them thoroughly ! Sir, my son is innocent ! First you took all the men, now the kids too ?! - Mom ! - Shut your mouth ! - What's this ?! Got you ! - Sir, that's not mine ! Tie his hands ! Take him ! Stand up ! You two ! Come on ! Go home ! Go home ! Mark ! Mom ! I got you... I got you. We would like to notify you that from now on District 120 will strictly enforce a curfew for minors. Minors in the streets and alleys must return to their homes by 10 pm. You kids on 2nd Avenue, we see you hanging around. The police are on patrol and will arrest anyone outside after curfew. This is out of concern for you, in District 120. - Has the boss arrived ? - Not yet. - Sir, someone to see you. - Tell her she'll have to wait. Sir ! You said to come back if I had any new information about my husband's death. - District ? - 120 One minute. What have you found ? I want to come work for you. I know you need assets in the streets, gathering information. You said you had information about your husband's murder. I did. I don't want to end up like him. What are we gonna do ? There's no update yet. I thought you said let's work together. You must have misunderstood me. It's best that you just leave. If anything comes up, you'll be the first to know. Thank you. Sit. Don't ever come to the office. We talk on the phone. Or we meet in the field. Tell me your name again. Maria, sir. What makes you think I need you ? I can see and hear everything. I've got lots of eyes and ears. No one suspects me. That's what you think. - I was a user and... - Junkie ? That's your selling point ? I'm just saying I know how these guys think. Tell me why you're here ! I want my name taken off the drug watch list. My children already lost their father. They can't lose me too. How old are they ? Thirteen, nine, and the youngest is five. So young still. Mine are at the age when they want nothing to do with me. This whole war on drugs is about them, isn't it ? We've already lost an entire generation to drugs. Good thing our government became fiercer and is sending a clear message to those druggies. This president is the only one who has the guts to stand up. He genuinely cares for the country. Do you care ? Yes, sir. You have the looks. That's a plus. I could use a woman on the team. I can't promise I'll get you off the list, but as long as you work for me, you and your children will have my protection. Sir, you have no idea how much this means to me. Alvin ! This is Alvin. Listen to him and you'll get home to your kids at night. But if you don't deliver, our deal is off. All yours. Torres... Barangay 120. Let's go ! Then what ? Vincent said you had something for me. - Victor. - Victor. Victor. Fuck that up and you're toast. Victor said you had something for me. Then he'll lead you around the corner, and you know what happens next. What if it doesn't go as planned ? Then we got a problem. What do you keep looking at ? See those kids ? - They're his runners. - So young ? If the cops catch them, they have to put them back on the streets. - That's awful. - These junkies don't give a fuck. That's why we have to catch him in the act. I can do that. If there's one thing I remember, it's how to score. You ever miss it ? Getting high ? It was fun when it was just Turo and I. But you can't get high and take care of kids. Took me a long time to realize that. The fear in their eyes made me promise I'd never raise a hand to them again. What about you ? What about me ? You have a family ? Not anymore. He's on the move. Holy shit ! - Momo ? - Who's that ? Holy shit ! - Maria ! - Been awhile. Yeah, wow. Forever. Last I heard you went all straight-edge on us. Is that true ? Yeah, but it's been tough. Welcome back. You still with Turo ? You got anything for me ? I don't operate on the street these days. Yeah, I know but just for now. Next time I'll call. Help me out. I'm hurting pretty bad right now. Ok, ok, ok. Only 'cause it's you. Follow me. Give me your hand. We had some fun back in the day. We could have some fun again if you... Come here. Put this on him. Now ! Let's go ! Hey, I'm leaving ! I'M A PUSHER DON'T BE LIKE ME Here's your payment. Go get your kids some dinner. - What's your problem ? - We were supposed to just do the deal. - You had your orders and I had mine. - Why didn't you tell me that ? I thought Boss told you that you were the bait. That is not what I signed up for. Do you know what your friend was really into ? He was a pedophile. Those boys weren't just his runners. So you didn't know ? You think I'm the bad guy ? These assholes we're going after, they're monsters. They don't deserve to live. Now go get your kids some dinner so we can go home. Wow, chicken ! - I want all the skin ! - No ! Give me that ! Where did this come from ? Found a new racket. What racket ? Get in there. Share some with your big brother. - Bye, mom. - Be safe. Go inside. Stay here, okay ? I'll see you tonight. - Don't go, mommy. - You have to be a big boy now, okay ? Mom has to go to work. Come on now. Maria ! - I got this for you. - Grace, you shouldn't have. Just keep it in your bag. Thank you. If you ever need anyone to talk to, father Reynaldo is there to listen. It really helps. How does it feel ? I'll tell you in a minute. Again. I can't do this. After a while it'll feel like brushing your teeth. Why do I need a gun ? I can just get tips. It's for your own protection. Not everyone who uses is a bad person. People can change. Everyone deserves a second chance. Would you give the people who killed your husband a second chance ? Killing them would not bring Turo back to life. True. But if they're dead, other families wouldn't have to suffer like you did. Remember who you're here for. Oh Joel. It's your lil' lap dog. What's up, bro ? Nothing, I just wanted to talk. - But it's all good. You're busy... - No, we're just hanging out. Come in. Come in ! Wait until I stop completely before you shoot. My hand hurts. Stop complaining. Focus. Finally. Next time empty your clip to be sure the fucker's dead. So how's school ? It's whatever. Yeah. No point studying for jobs that don't exist. How was your game earlier ? I saw you. You're improving. I can't relate to those kids anymore. Ever since dad died, they think they're better than me. If anyone gives you trouble, come tell me. I keep thinking he's gonna walk in the door one night. I went through the same shit when I lost my dad. How the cops gonna kill both our dads and tell us it's good for us ? Does it get any easier ? No. You just get better at dealing with it. Sometimes you miss them too much. Sometimes... you wanna forget. Nah, I'm good. You sure ? Yeah, I dont wanna forget. Just try it, bro. He said he's good. Check this out. - Oh shit ! - Locally made. Cops try and run up on me like they did our dads... I'ma let them have it. They can't kill me like a dog. We hunt back. They're just targeting us, the poor. Have you seen any rich guys hunted down by the police ? None, right ? If they really want to stop the drugs, they should go after the big drug lords, not small timers like us. But they're all making money from it. From the crooked cops to the big shot politicians. They're all taking a cut. Where do you think we get our supply ? Watch your mouth ! Hey, hey, hey... Where do you think you're going ? I need to go home. My siblings are alone. Good man. Come. Bro, if you ever need anything, anything at all, just tell me. I'll take care of it. Come back anytime. What's taking so long ? "Happy ending." Hello, Mark. I can't talk right now. - We're out of Nina's medicine. - I'll get some on my way home. When's that gonna be ? Late. Let's go. I gotta go. Now ! - Please, have mercy ! - Now ! Please, don't ! Get off ! Let's go ! What the fuck was that ? That guy is someone's son ! Someone's dad ! Someone's husband ! He's a cockroach that needs to be stepped on. I'm not like you. No, you're not. You're gonna get us both killed. I got your slippers. Let's play, mommy ! Please ! Okay, one game. You're not good at this though ! Oh really ? Who taught you this game ? What were you saying ? Let's see if you learned something from your mom. A lot of big talk for a small guy. Are you sure you want to leave ? Yeah, too many bad memories here. My cousin has a space for rent in Navotas. Nice place. Real cheap. But it'll only be available in a couple of months. - Can it be ready sooner ? - I'll call him. Something else ? I'm looking for some work. - Doing what ? - Anything. A friend of mine runs a cleaning service. That would be great. I'll arrange a meeting. Mom ! He says he knows you. - Take your brothers inside. - Ok, mom. Next time I'll bring you some chocolates. Thank you, mister ! They're adorable. I really hope you're cherishing this time with them. While they're still young. I tried calling but I couldn't get through. I've been having problems with my battery. You would tell me if our agreement has changed, wouldn't you ? Nothing's changed. I know it's easy to get confused out there. Sometimes it's hard to remember which side you're on. You know how I keep it straight in my head ? We have the support of the people. They rely on us to keep peace and order. Cleaning the streets is our cross to bear. It's our duty. - See you tonight. - Tonight ? Charge your phone. Wake up ! Get up ! Who are you ? Sir, who are you ? Oscar Guzman ? You have the wrong house ! Love ! Who are you ? Whatever you're looking for isn't here ! - The kids ! - Come here ! Sir, please ! My wife is pregnant ! Sir please, have mercy ! My wife's pregnant ! So you're not Oscar Guzman ? Alright. We'll just kill her instead. Ok, ok ! It's me. I'm Oscar Guzman ! Sir, please don't hurt her ! I told you it's me ! I'm Oscar Guzman ! I'm the man you're looking for ! - Take out the kids ! - Wait, wait ! Where are you taking them ? Please don't hurt them ! Stay over there ! I'm begging you ! Please, don't hurt my children ! We're not animals. You should have surrendered when you had the chance. Please have mercy ! This is your fault. - He's got a gun ! - What ? No, I don't have a gun ! - He's fighting back ! - I'm not fighting back ! - Shoot him ! - Ma'am, I'm begging you ! - I have children ! - Fuck you ! She has kids too ! - I surrender ! I surrender ! - Do it now. Do it ! - No ! Please ! - Now ! Good job. Love ! Love ! Wake up ! What have you done ? He had surrendered ! Why did you still shoot ? Why ? Mom, next week we need to pay for school. Liar. Oh really ? Blabber mouth ! Shut up ! What ? I'm just saying the truth. - Shut up ! - Don't you dare hurt me ! Mom ! Mom, what's wrong ? Take a seat. I'll take care of that, mom. - Nina, go get some water ! - Is mom sick ? Mom, what's wrong ? Mom, here's your water. What happened ? Mom, what's the matter ? Mom... We'll get through this, mom. We'll get through this together. Wait ! Wait ! Where did it come from ? I don't know. Honestly, I don't ! It's cheap, that's all I know. How much ? One point five ! Asshole. That's impossible. I swear ! I swear on my life ! It's from China ! All the kids are picking it up ! We had a deal, right ? You buy from me and no one else. You should have just told me. We could have worked something out. Wait, wait ! I'll give you names. What's the name ? Joel ! Joel Delgado ! From District 118 ! Asshole. You need to learn. This is your fault. Please, no ! Have mercy please, my kids are still small. I'll do anything you... Throw him in 118. Please forgive me, my love. I'm completely lost without you. - Where do you think you're going ? - To shoot hoops. Not tonight. I need you to cook dinner. I can't. I'm late for the game. Mark, I don't have time to argue. Nina, take your medicine. - Shit. I was supposed to get some. - Where are you going again ? - Go buy some medicine for your sister. - Where are you off to ? Enough ! You're making me late ! - What ? - Second floor. VIP room. Jacob. Finally. Well worth the wait though. Come in ! Surprise, surprise ! Go on, miss. Make my friend happy. Hi, handsome. What's your name, handsome ? Peter. I'll take care of you, Peter. - You want a drink ? - Sure. He's lying. Why would he lie about his name ? Why wouldn't he ? He seems like a good guy. It's him. Stop fucking around. - Don't blow it, man ! - Goodbye. Goodbye ! Sorry about that. They're funny. Where would you like to go ? - Look, we don't have to do anything. - But I'm already paid for. I'll just tell them we did. Why is that ? You see, miss... How do I... I'm getting married next week. Believe me you are beautiful, but I... Mark. There. For tuition. Nina, you have classes, right ? Yes, mom. We take you live to Quezon City, where last night another extra judicial killing took place. Peter Del Rosario was a fresh graduate with honors. According to his brother, they were out celebrating as he'd been hired for an overseas job. He was also engaged to be married. He never used drugs. He wasn't like that. With no prior record as a drug offender, it is believed that this is a case of mistaken identity. The unidentified woman was the last person seen with Peter. Mom ! Mom is on TV ! - That's not me. - Looks like you, mom. - Son of a bitch, I said it's not ! - Mom. I just said they looked alike. I didn't think she'd get so mad. I miss dad. Me too. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we go to the park today ? What about school ? Let's skip class. I told you. I told you we had the wrong guy. Good morning. You knew it wasn't him and we still did it. We murdered an innocent kid. It happens. You're kidding me. Day off. What's your problem ? How long have you known that Ventura is a pusher ? Does it really fucking matter ? You said we were taking out monsters. Murderers, pedophiles. You said we were the good guys ! Don't be stupid, Maria. We take out whoever they want us to. The EJK's are just a cover. You're the real monster. Let me out. How did you think this would end ? Alvin, I see their faces. At night, when I close my eyes. I hear their kids screaming. The only kids you should be thinking about are your own. They're all I'm thinking about. I'm done. Mark, push ! Hold tight ! Who wants soda ? Sure ! Hector, can I talk to you for a minute ? - Of course. - In private. Tony... Hector, I need a place to hide. I've done some terrible things. Maria, what are you talking about ? They're going to kill my whole family unless I do what they say. Don't tell mom I got you these. It's our little secret, okay ? Joel, here ! We'll be alright. - Where'd they go ? - That way. No, no, shit ! Fuck me, no ! What happened ? They took it all ! I'm a dead man. Not now. Nina ! Mark ! Nina ! Mark ! Pick up. Pick up. Maria, I'm sorry. I thought they were with you. - Oh, so now I'm a bad mother too ? - I didn't say that ! Angel, you seen my kids ? Last I saw they were heading to 5th Ave. There was a shooting on 5th Avenue. Where are you ? Was the soda worth it ? It better have been. Nina ? Nina, are you okay ? How are you feeling ? Ma'am, she had an asthma attack, but she's fine now. I'm so sorry I wasn't there, baby. We were on our way home from the park. Why did you even take them out ? We're fine, mom ! Nothing's fine ! You could have all gotten killed ! Are you that stupid ? At least one of us is taking care of them ! That's more than you ! I'm working every night to take care of them ! I've seen what kind of work you do ! Only a couple of months after dad died, spreading your legs for whoever pays ! Mark... Mark ! Mark ! I spoke to Boss. He wasn't happy, but he agreed to let you go. On one condition. You do one last favor for him. When ? Tonight. See you at the train tracks. Fuck ! Fuck ! Where are we gonna go ? I don't know. We can't stay here though. - What happened ? - Somebody ratted us out. We're so fucked ! - They're gonna come for us. - Shut the fuck up and let me think ! How do you know someone squealed ? It was a drug bust. They knew we were coming. Bro ! You sure you trust this kid ? With my life. Only one way to find out. Nina, help us pack. Mom, I don't want to leave. Nina, I don't want to leave either. But it's not safe for us here anymore. And it's my job to keep you safe, right ? Maria. Still no sign of Mark. I know where he might be. You sure you don't want to just leave today ? There's one last thing I have to take care of. Look at his eyes. He's totally lit. Do it. I can't. Finish him ! I can't. Aunty ? Shoot now ! You killed them ! Mark ? Mark ? Where's Mark ? Mark ! Mark ? Mark... What have you done ? What have you done, mom ? Come here. It's over. So this is who you are ? I was trying to protect you, but I only put you in more danger. But why ? Why, mom ? Because I love you more than anything in the world. I would do anything for you. You know that, right ? I love you too, mom. Forgive me, son. Let's go. Let's go ! Mom ! Mom... Sir, no ! Are you serious ? You're high ? Please, don't involve him in this. It was you that got him involved. What's this ? You're still using ? What do we do with the kid ? Let's give him a gun and tell him to run. I'm begging you, please have mercy. What do you think ? Take him outside. Please, spare him. - Take him out ! - Mom ! Help me ! Mom ! Please help me ! Mom ! I didn't want this either. Cut him loose. Fuck off. Fuck off ! subtitles: Perfect
