Eat this please! Get up please! Eat this! Please eat! Please stand up! Take! Eat this! My grandpa used to always say.. That life and death is the rule of the nature! And everyone needs to keep taking birth again and again! So that he could bring joy to the lifes of others! So taking forward his legacy! Let us not waste a moment to celebrate life! DJ Jango, Lets play. Bye..bye..Jango! Sir, I've checked your card! It is blocked! Your grandpa died in the noon and how.. ..dare you attend a party at night? Don't you have any shame? Listen! You keep cool here! Let me talk! I'm present here! I will talk! -Do you understand? Oh! Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting here Mr. Karan! How dare you? How could you dare to block my card? Do you know how embarrassing that was? I had to call uncle at midnight for money! I am sorry...! -....about the loss! Your gradfather Mr. Purohit was a gem of a person! I know...! Yes..tell me..where are the papers? Where am I supposed to sign? Let us finish the formalities! And listen to one more thing! My grandfather has passed away and you are also being fired! What? -Give me the money and get lost! Keep calm! Am I not there? I will talk! Keep cool! There is one more bad news for you Mr. Karan! Your grandfather..Mr. Harkishan Purohit! Has not left anything in his Will for his grandson! Is this some kind of a joke? What do you mean? What she means is that...! Your grandfather has donated all the property.. ..wealth and money! What? Impossible! My grandfather won't do anything like this! Why don't you say something? You were his manager for bloody thirty years! I am sorry! Mr. Mehta is no longer his manager! What? Yes Mr. Mehta! -Mr. Purohit has donated all his property.. ..from India and all his accounts in USA funds, bonds.. ..equity funds and policies as well as off shore investments! He has donated everyting in charity! Oh yes! There are twelve motels! He has appointed you as manager for those motels! Good..good! Thank god! This is some kind of a game you are playing with me! My grandfather must not have done anything like this! This is your own fraud! More than me it is you who must be.. ..knowing your own grandfather! Do you think your grandfather can't cannot.. ..do anything like this with you? Bloody old man has died but he's harassing.. ..me even after his death! Hello...just a minute! Where are you going? I will go to meet another lawyer and get this Will checked! That's up to you! But don't go to home! Why the court has already sealed your home today morning. What? What the hell is this? And one minute! Give me your car keys please! Okay! Take this! -No, manager! I want the keys of his car! Yes..these are his car keys only! What the hell you are giving keys of my car for? What am I supposed to do and where am I supposed to go? Why are you not saying anyting? I'll talk only when you'll let me say anything man! By the way Mr. Lawyer! Has Mr. Purohit beqeathed something at.. ..least in his Will for his grandson? Oh yes! There is...! Please sit down! Yah! My parents? Something must be written in his.. ..will about my mother and father? Who are they and where are they? Something must be mentioned! -Unfortunately.. ..your grandpa has mentioned only you as a family member. No other information is there about any.. ..other family member in this will! Did you see that? He always told that he would disclose at an appropriate time! Before the right time came he has passed away! If money is not bequeathed to me then to whom has he given it? There is one Ashram located at the.. ..bank of River Narmada in Gujarat! Your grandfather was a trustee of that Ashram! Your grandfather has donated all.. ..his wealth to that Ashram only! And if you want your share! You'll have to go to the trustees of that.. ..Ashram and get their signature.. ..on this 'No Objection Certificate'! I have also been instructed that all these funds should be.. ..transferred into the Ashram's bank after three months! You mean to say for securing my own rights and privileges.. ..I must get a signature of those.. ..poor and beggars for the sake. Yes Mr. Karan! Because that is the only way! But considering the reality.. ..the position you are occupying today...! You are appearing to be a real poor and a beggar! Because the money is with them! Yes Savio? Listen to me bro! Come outside I have a gift for you. Thirteen days it is.. If I don't get my money,. The fourteenth day your girlfriend will weep for you! The foreigner has passed away! His grandson, Karan, is coming to the Ashram soon! Hello uncle! Listen Karan! Have you reached? Yes, I have reached in India! It's humid! It is quite hot here! Okay! -And thank you for sponsoring my ticket! But you haven't sent me the details of my next flight as yet! My son, no flight goes to the place.. ..where you will be going next! Then what? Uncle! I'm sorry to keep on disturbing you but! This is unbearable! What? At least you could have found me a reservation! Listen to me grandson! In India, you can get admission in a reservation.. ..quota in a medical college.. ..but not in train! Just endure through this journey! I am doing the arrangements for the.. ..remaining part of your journey! -Make it quick damn it! -What? Uncle! Please! Make it as soon as possible! I hope you understand! I am suffocating here! I'm feeling as if how soon I get a sign.. ..of those poor trustees and I return! You won't get a sign in so much haste! And yes..by the way! Haven't you kept the documents safe? Yah! Yah! They are very much safe in my pouch! You fool! Don't touch! It is not a toy! Karan! Have you kept the last remains.. ..of grandpa safe in your luggage? Yes! Those last remains are safe in.. ..my bag and I had to waste two.. ..hours at the airport security for that! It's too heavy! -What? Nothing! -You go and sleep my dear! What for are you interrupting? When did I say anything in between? -Okay! Listen to me Karan! One gentleman called 'Guptaji' will.. ..come to receive you at the station! He will take you from there to the ashram! And at the ashram..? Who? That lady....Supriya! -You will meet 'Supriya Bharati' there! She is the main administrator there! All these old characters like 'Supriya.. ..Bharati' and 'Gupta' will bore me now! It is the worst journey of my life! Hello? My son, the worst is yet to come! Nothing happens in Rs. 50/-! Please come! This is your seat! Please sleep comfortably! Thank you! What will Rs. 500 achieve? I want my three million dollars! I want it at any cost! Goddess Narmada please bless us! Excuse me! Let me help you! Aunty..what is this you are doing? I am praying to Goddess Narmada for the safety of my nephews! River safeguards anybody or lets us sink.. ..it entirely depends on one's own belief, my son. Victory to my mother Narmada. Mother Reva Reva! Your water is so pure! Mother Reva Reva!

We will start! Mother Goddess Narmada bless me! Is this River Narmada? Of course it is Narmada only! -But yesterday when I was in train.. ..I saw Narmada during my journey!

But it seems Narmada is also a very big river here! It must be originating from the jungles here, isn't? -No, my dear! It starts from a far off place! It originates from the mountains! It originates from a place called 'Amar Kantak' and.. ..then merges into the ocean after flowing for 800 miles! You originate from 'Amar Kanth'! You bring peace and prosperity! You originate from 'Amar Kanth'! You bring peace and prosperity! You quench the thirst of our civilisation since ages. You quench the thirst of our civilisation since ages. You bless peace and properity! Mother Reva! Mother Reva! -You have come at the right time! Tomorrow 'Narmada Anniversary' is there!

I have important things to do! And early morning is not my time! Let us meet tomorrow in the noon! -What? Yah! Here we have reached Timba-Tola! From here a mountain route goes to the ashram! We'll walk now! Come with me! On foot? Yes! On foot! Are you sure dude? What? -I mean...uncle! Isn't there any other route to reach up to the ashram! If you can fly then do it! So it is better that you pray for.. ..the Mother Narmada and get going! May Goddess Narmada bless us! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Blessed is the land O Narmada,. We humans are also blessed. Blessed is the land O Narmada,. We humans are also blessed. By the holy touch of your water. Mother Reva! Mother Reva! No..I can't walk any more! I am very exhausted now! Just assume that we've reached! Yes..of course! -Do you see that point? Where? Where? -That point.. The ashram is located there? After reaching there the ashram will.. ..come within the range of our sight! -What? Yes! Come..follow me! -Just assume that we've reached! Take care! Easy! Easy! Hey see! Uncle Gupta has come! Gupta uncle has come with the guest! Yes! I've come with the guest! Yes! Stop! Stop! Take care..my son! Take care! Finally! Give me the bag! -No! What? -Rupees five hundred? I got rupees five hundred! Go man go! God bless you! Come! Come please! No..no..not all this just now! But this is a holy gesture to welcome a guest my son! Not now please! -Guptaji! Okay...okay.. As you please! Sister Kamala, you do the rites later! You can go now! And this is your room, my son! You have a wash first and then we will have our food soon! No! I am not going to stay here! What is this? I won't stay here! The foreigner used to stay here only! Yah! But I am not my grandfather! You arrange for some other place! Is there any hotel nearby? -It's okay even if it may be a 3-star! Look at his whims and fancies! This is an ashram and not a shelter home for pilgrims! You come at any time and then you cause so much trouble? Tell me that you'll come in time from tomorrow? Yes! I'll come in time from tomorrow! You won't trouble Kamala ma'am! -I will trouble her! What? -If she shouts at everybody.. ..then even I will do the same! You scoundrel! Wait! Come! Meet your guest! She is 'Supriya'? Namaste! Hey...Hi! I mean...Namaste! Hi! -Actually, I was busy in tomorrow's program.. ..so I got late to come here! Gupta-uncle, did you show him the room? He is refusing to stay there! -It is not acceptable to him! We'll have to arrange for some other accommodation! Oh..no..no! It's not like that! When did I refuse Guptaji? Oh God? -I wanted to say that this room should.. ..be preserved in memory of my grandpa! But it's okay! It's fine! -I'll stay here! I will stay here only, Guptaji! Great! So you become fresh! Okay! -Eat some food and relax! I have some work! -I will finish that and then meet you! Ah! By the way...! -Please set up an alarm of 5 AM tomorrow.. ..for a function to attend! -He has already refused! When did I refuse Guptaji? I thought that the program is today! Okay. Tomorrow..I don't mind! I'll come! I will surely come Guptaji! I'll join you tomorrow! You will enjoy the program! The grandpa never missed it! Supriya...come quickly! Yes! I am coming! -Okay! I will meet you later! In this ashram...! Supriya..listen! I have ordered for everything that.. ..you need in tomorrow's function! I'll enjoy! I will enjoy here a lot! Okay! I'll go! No! I won't spare you! I'll beat you! Leave her please! Leave her! Come! Rambali has beaten her! This is a everyday trouble! I keep telling her to go and stay with her in-laws! The dispute will end then-and-there! I did not do anything! That boy was bent on going to the river! So I took him there! Upon returning from there Rambali started.. ..shouting at me as 'Issueless'! She was asking why did I touch her son.. ..without taking her permission first! She didn't even listen to me! This is wrong! Before beating you so much she should have.. ..at least heard your side of story. Rambali just needs an excuse to hit me! Her husband is a gentleman! He looks after me like a sister! But Rambali has a doubt in mind! Okay! -She accuses me as her husband's keep! Because I don't have a child and because.. ..I don't stay at my Gharwala! Gharwala? Yes! Gharwala? My Dhani! My Dhani. -Husband! -Dhani? Who? I mean...my husband! -Okay..okay..your husband! Okay..then why don't you stay with your husband? Go and stay with him! What is the problem? He is the root of the whole problem! The fault is in my husband only! But everybody feels afraid of telling him! On the contrary.. ..when husband calls me issueless, everybody endorse him only! Bloody feminine! So it is better that I stay without him only! I don't want a child! That boy. -Laddoo. Is there with me! I look upon him as my son only! Okay! Forget all this! You come! You come and show me all of my grandpa's.. ..prop..I mean the ashram! -Come! Let us go! Come on..get up! This is the school! It is nice! Is this a symbol made by 'Saath-Sali'? Who? Do you mean, you recognise this symbol? What? This is the local God of the villagers here! Is it? Where will I meet 'Saath-Sali'? Only the Bittu-Banga know that! Yes! I had read this name! I have shot a photograph! Look at this photo! Bittu-Banga's photo? Oh damn it! My battery.. What? -No..nothing! -The network doesn't reach here in the ashram! Even that is known to Bittu-Banga only! This Bittu-banga seems to be knowing everything here! Are they any sage here or what? What happened? -Why are you laughing? Oh hello? Why are you laughing? Welcome to India Karan! Hello Kamala Doshi! Come here! Look..Supriya and Karan also have arrived! Welcome! Welcome! Everything is ready here! Uncle..I will look after the food preparations and come soon! Hello Guptaji? How are you? I'm fine! Everything is ready! -What is this? Oh..what? Hey.. what? What the hell? Leave me! Hey you! Stay away! He's asking you to stay away! Did you meet them? Who? Both of these men! -These men? Yes! Of course! They are 'Bittu-Banga'! Our sages! This is 'Bittu' and this is 'Banga'! Are these the 'Bittu-Bangas'? Both of them are brothers only! They belong to our ashram's family only! And this is our.... Brother Karan! -I recognised him! Hi Banga! My name is 'Bittu'! Okay! He is 'Bittu'! We call them 'Bittu-Banga' only! It causes lot of confusion! Yes! They call us 'Bittu-Banga' only! Shall we begin the puja? -Yes.. Bittu-banga! You come with me! And Bittu-Banga? You go to the river bank with the red saree stand! Go! Get going about it! -Go! Do it quickly! Come on Karan! We'll go! Okay! Okay! Lift it and let us go! Now you'll have to tell me what is all this going on? Today is 'Narmada-Anniversary'! So for this holy purpose there is a.. ..worship function scheduled here! And a Saree will be worn to the River Narmada now! What? A saree will worn to a river? -Yes! -How? You see it yourself! My son! So far your grandpa used to perform the Abhishek. The holy worship! Now today onward you perform it! -Take this! May Mother Goddess Narmada bless! May Mother Goddess Narmada bless! You cleanse lakhs of sins with your river body.. ..which is beautifully decorated by lakhs of swans. In that holy place.. ..you give both prosperity as well as.. ..liberation to the humans and animals. The presence of Brahma.. ..Vishnu and Shankara in your holy river.. ..body provides the protective shield. O devi Narmada.. ..I bow down to your lotus feet, please give me your refuge. You are the yoga of all the yogis! You are the meditation of all the sages! Your presence here today is a sacred.. ..blessing for the entire world! Jumping and flowing everywhere you.. ..are always alert and awaken! To seek you and to meet you everybody worships you! Namarda, Mekalsuta, Neeva Induja, Shivatmaja, Reva! Namarda, Mekalsuta, Neeva Induja, Shivatmaja, Reva! These are different names of the River Narmada! Bless us with water and with life.. ..we bow down to you o mother Narmada. I can't believe this! These guys should go to Olympics, man! Just a second! Sure! Yes Mehta-uncle? Karan, I've been trying to call you since yesterday! There is no network in the ashram! I have come to a near-by town! Okay..okay! By the way! Did you meet the trustees? Ya.. Met the ones you mentioned about.. -That Guptaji and Supriya! And what about other trustees? Don't know yet! How much time will it take to meet all these people? Guptaji seems to be a very emotional type of a person! I will win his confidence and get the remaining information! Okay! -I can't call you everyday because I've to.. ..walk out of the ashram a lot for that! I will keep recording video clips.. ..and keep sending them to you! Take care! We'll talk later! Hey! -Hi! What's happening there? What are these people doing? Uncle's family members have arrived to bid him a 'Bye' here! Uncle is starting a 'Parikrama' today! Parikrama means walk along river! -What Parikrama? Narmada river's Parikrama! Parikrama means walk along river! Today they start walking from here and they.. ..aim to reach up to the river's origin! -Walking? Yes! -They will go up to the confluence of river.. ..Narmada with sea and then return! You mean these people will walk.. ..a distance of 2,600 kilometers? And that too through these jungles? Yes! -Why? I mean.. What will they achieve? Reva! Meet Reva? -Yes! Every pilgrim doing this leave from here with a certain faith! That during the whole journey the river.. ..Narmada herself will protect them! And keep meeting them throughout! And you believe in this? I can't claim that I don't believe it! What a joke! Are all these people going for a 'Parikrama' today? Yes! Hey..hello sir? Yes..you? Mother Goddess Narmada bless us! -Mother Goddess Narmada bless us! Are you going for a Narmada Parikrama? . -Yes! Doing it second-time! -Take this Prasad. -pious food! Take it in right hand! I couldn't complete it first time because of my job duties! But this time I won't go back without completing it now! And you believe that during this journey.. ..the river will come and say to you.. Hi dude! I am Narmada! It won't say this actually! But when she will meet me I pray I don't.. ..do a mistake in recognising her! Oh you Indians! You romanticise everything in life! Hello..this is a river! This is just a river! Rivers are there everywhere throughout the world! In America also there are Amazon and Mississippi.. ..rivers and I have seen people.. ..doing lots of adventures over the river there! Scuba-diving and river-rafting etc.! But I never heard that anyone has.. ..seen River in a human form there! Well, if you do parikrama of those rivers with.. ..such a faith they may also appear before you! It seems this country has survived on the basis of faith only! And I am sorry I don't believe in all this! Do it to believe it! If he walks back up to the ashram its more than enough! One more thing! If you meet Reva then take a selfie and show it to me! Okay? God bless you! What's this? -Mother Goddess Narmada bless us! Mother Goddess Narmada bless us! -Shall we go to eat food? Coming to eat? -You please continue! -I am not really hungry! Mother Goddess Narmada bless you! What do you gain by doing a parikrama? I mean..it is waste time..waste of energy! If you don't believe in the tradition of Parikrama.. ..then no problem! Whatever we like is the ultimate truth! No..my problem is that how do you like.. ..all this being so educated and sane? Oh..in that case..let me tell you! Experience and assumptions are two different notions! Experience and assumptions! The faith that river Narmada appears.. ..in human form is my experience! And river Narmada does not appear in.. ..human form is your assupmption! Neither your argument nor my faith has been.. ..proven and hence can't be falsified! So I am respecting your half truth.. ..and you should respect mine! Okay! You are right! You should have eaten food there on the river bank itself! Don't you think the hygine standard.. ..in our ashram needs to be improved? I mean we should replace the old.. ..cook and bring in some new guy? One can always cook for oneself in Ashram. Ah..Bandu fakir! Who? -Yes..Bandu fakir! Hey you girl! Stop! I am coming with you! Is he the guy? We offer our respects please! Namaste! I will come with you and eat rotis cooked by you! Good! Let us go! I'll myself cook them! Who is he? He is a monk! Nothing to worry! Let us go! I will not allow you to proceed, brother! I won't at all allow you to proceed! You must eat something with me! -Not now dear! We will come some other time! But I cannot let you go without eating something at my home! Okay! Let us eat at your home today! Hey you girl..will you come? Okay! -My home has become a place of pilgrimage today! What the hell...! My home has become a place of pilgrimage today! I won't let you proceed without eating! Will you just keep talking or give us anything to eat? Yes...sure! What happened? There is nothing at home today! But don't go without eating anything! That is a country liquor! Isn't it? -Yes! Yes! You will die without eating food but.. ..you won't give up drinking liquor! There is not even a grain of food at home! Do you have some salt? I mean it...salt! Yes! -Then get it! Be quick! What now? May Mother Goddess Narmada bless me! Happy? -Yes! What is there in this bag? -Hello..first of all this is not a bag! This is my energy bar! Hey..hello..excuse me! Boys..hey you boys! Come here quickly! Take this! -No...no! A fakir is giving this! Take it! Hello..but they don't want it! Go..go! I bless you! Let us go! What the hell? -Relax! Unless you go to such huts one doesn't.. ..realise what is real face of poverty! Your grandpa really wished that these poor.. ..people must get food twice a day! Okay! Hey you girl? Why am I coming with you|? The food can be eaten at ashram only! Isn't it? Do you understand what I mean? If I eat food at your place today it will.. ..mean that man left us hungry today! But you didn't eat anything! -How can you say that? I did eat whatever that he offered! You go now! I have eaten my diet today! Go! Will you go please? People look upon me as a 'Fakir' but I cannot deceive myself! Go...I say! He drank country liquor on empty stomach! His stomach will burn if he doesn't eat anything! Don't worry! Kalewali Maa will feed him something for sure! Mehta uncle! I forgot to tell you! It would be nice if you can arrange a bike for me here! I am being required to walk a lot here! And yes! -Before expecting these people to sign.. ..I wish to roam around with them here! -I must understand them! But understanding these people is very difficult! Understanding Bittu-Banga is okay but an educated.. ..girl like Supriya bows before a fakir! Bittu-Banga are uneducated but they.. ..have an engineer's intelligence! And how perfectly they shoot an arrow! Puriya is also an uneducated girl but she sings so nice! The poverty here is so grim that people.. ..here are even greedy for eating! I gave some of my chocolates to a few hungry kids! Their faces glowed with so much joy that.. ..I had never seen such faces before! You can feed a family of five persons.. ..for five days in just $10! You know! Eat this brother Karan! Eat it..it is hot! But I don't want to eat just now! Why? You didn't eat in the noon also! Supriya was telling me that! She has cooked this herself! Has Supriya cooked this? -Yes! For my sake..? -Not for your sake but for everybody! Darn it! For everybody! Hey you girl! Karan will eat it himself! You go to your home! You will get late! -But let him eat the food first! Then I will go anyway! -Eat this prasad. -the sacred food! -Okay! Give me! Oh hello? -Does anyone eat prasad. The sacred food on the palm of a left hand at all? You girl..is this any right manner.. ..of behaviour with a guest indeed? -It's okay Guptaji! It's okay! But what wrong did I do? I was only teaching him the right manner! -It's okay! Karan, are you going to pay for today's.. ..function by cheque only or by cash? Why I have to pay for it? -Your grandpa. The foreigner only used to sponsor every year till now! Now it has become almost like a tradition my son! Okay! How much? I mean..what's the amount? Everything put together, the amount is Rs. 1,28,000/-! One lakh twenty eight thousand? The food and puja was managed at a cost of Rs. 28,000/-! We donated a sari worth one lakh to the mother River Narmada! But I am not having so much cash! I am having only 20-25 thousand! Nothing more is there with me! -Oh god! This is a big problem! There is no ATM also located nearby! No? Oh yah! No ATM is there nearby! Otherwise I would have paid you the amount right away! No..you don't worry! We'll find some solution! Let me leave for my home at Dungarpur now! I am supposed to come early tomorrow! Serve him the food! Go on..go on! No! You keep it! I'll eat it! You go home now! Hello..this Gupta keeps talking! I won't go without feeding Supriya! Supriya has not eaten food as yet? -No! Why? I don't know! She was saying that she won't eat food today! But why? Going by my experience I am making an assumption.. ..that you are not eating food.. ..because a fakir has not eaten food today! No..There is nothing like that! That is why you didn't eat food! By the way I have brought some sweet for you! You can't say no! It is a prasad. -a sacred food! Thank you! This is 'Mahabharata'! Right? -Yes! Mahabharat! Oh yah! Mahabharat! Have you read it? -No! Never got a chance! But you must be knowing something! Yes! I know Bheem, Arjun, Krishna etc.! Do you know 'Draupadi's Swayamwar'? -Yah! I know that! Arjun had shot an arrow in the eye of a fish above! Right? Not bad! Do you know 'Lakshagriha'? Lakshagriha means home of wax! Yah! Duryodhana had made a conspiracy to kill the Pandawas! House of Wax! -'Vishwarup Darshan'? Vishwarup Darshan' means view of universe! -Yah! I know! Nice! -'Bhishma's Pratidnya?' Pratidnya means oath! Yah! -Geeta? Yah! -Gandhari's Shraap? 'Shraap' means curse! -Yah! Sudarshan Chakra'? Sudarshan Chakra is Krishna's weapon! -Yah! Eklavya? -Shakuni's pasa? 'Pasa' means dice! Yes! I never knew that I know so much! Exactly! -Even I had felt the same! When I sat down to read the stories I haven't heard or read.. ..even I felt that I.. ..knew all these thing already! Not only me but the people of our country.. ..must be knowing all these things! Whether it may be an educated scholar.. ..or even an uneducated aborigine! The noble work which you are doing to educate.. ..the rural aborigines is great! -That's incredible! I don't know whether we have a right.. ..to improve the aborigines.. But it is enough that we can bring.. ..some improvements to their lives! And a lot is yet to be done! These people are forced to go to the urban.. ..areas for work except in monsoon! I wish to develop means of employment.. ..for them at this place only! My father used to organise a musical program every two years! I wish to reinstate this tradition! May I ask you something? Why did you choose this work? It is hereditary! My mother, father.. ..Shastri-Uncle, Guptaji and even your grandfather..! I have seen all of them offering service.. ..here with a great faith in their minds! But it is not necessary that every.. ..case that faith need to exist! According to me the upbringing makes a big difference! You have stayed in America for so many years now! Even after grandpa's death you have come here! Without any selfish motive! Ah! Yah! Without any selfish motive! No! Not possible! But why? -That work belongs to the aborigines! We won't do that! You will get good income through the work.. ..by keeping it at home for whole year! Sir..you please come here! Me? -Yes..yes! Sir..you please come! Please do come here! Please tell them how they can get more honey.. ..safely at home instead of jungle! Please convince them about this! -But what am I to tell them? Even I will feel very happy if Mr. Laxman.. ..succeeds in what he is pursuing for! If you feel happy about it I'll.. ..try to say a few words to them! Hello friends.. ..what this brother is telling you really a piece of wisdom! Everybody should cultivate honey! Cultivate? -Say 'Ucher' means cultivate! Okay! -You should cultivate honey at home! And thereby achieve progress in life! Good! Jai Hind! -Thank you! Where is Dityo? The foreigner arrived at ashram is asking.. ..everybody to domesticate honey gathering! Is it? A job nobody else except me could do will.. ..now be done by the kids at home? Come! Let us go and see! Good morning Guptaji! Welcome! Welcome! Karan! Welcome! Take this! I'm having only Rs. 20,000 with me just now! Please keep this as long as I arrange.. ..for the remaining amount! -I was in no hurry! You could have given the whole amount together! No! No! I won't let any work of the.. ..ashram get hindered for money! By the way what I wanted to say! Now that I have come shall we conduct a meeting.. ..with the trustees of the ashram? So that I get to know who does what? Listen to me my son? -Yes! -You have already met me and Supriya! Yes! You are right! -Besides from among the remaining you.. ..met Bittu-Banga also yesterday! Bittu-Banga? Are they also the trustees? Yes! Actually their mother 'Naradi' Was a trustee here earlier! But after her death your grandfather.. ..made both of them the trustees! Right! Right! -Both of them are very smart! Both look after farming.. ..cows shelter and ration for kitchen of the ashram very well. Hmmmm! Okay! And who is this? Ganesh Shastri? -Ganesh Shastri? -Yes! He is a very learned Pandit! Very highly learned indeed! He runs a medicine clinic far away from here! At a place called 'Kankavati'! Okay! Do arrange my meeting with him! -Sure! And..yah..Maulana Ali Baksh? Who is this? -The whole of the jungle bows before his command! Okay! But what does he do? My son..even if we just get his blessings.. ..then also we're obliged! Okay! -He is a fakir.. Okay! He is a fakir? Yes! Just a minute! Maulana Ali Baksh means is he that 'Bandu fakir'? Yes! Exactly! That's him! -What? Namaskar! Yes..tell me? I wanted to talk with you regarding.. ..the funds left by your grandfather! Yes! Yes! Of course! Please sit! Please be seated! Yah! The point is thousands of people begin the.. ..journey of Narmada-Parikrama every year! Yah! Yah! -And it is said that nobody who does the.. ..Parikrama never sleeps hungry at night! Incredible! Mother Reva delivers the grains for food.. ..in one or the other manner to them! Right...right! And men like me always feed those pilgrims.. ..to remit our debt to the Goddess! Sada...what? -Serving food for all the pilgrims! Okay! Okay! Your grandfather used to donate Rs. 51,000 every year for this cause! How much would you like to donate? This old man has not given me any property.. ..but he's been donating freely! Yes...tell me! -Look old man! This is not a good time to talk! Right? Shall we talk some other time? Okay? Sir..whatever you can afford! Listen to me loud and clear old man? I am not interested in your fairy-tales.. ..of this river appearing in human form! And if you don't have money what's the.. ..point in begging from others too feed? Sir..howsoever poor a man may be.. ..but he does feed his own family! I believe that the pilgrims coming for.. ..the Narmada-Parikrama are my brethern! Even your grandfather believed the same! My grandpa may be believing this but I can't.. ..spend money for anybody's free diet! Don't show me your depressing face ever again! Bittu-Banga..I need your sign! Shhhhhh! Keep quiet! -What? What happened? Yes..tell me..brother Karan? What happened? Just a minute! I came for this purpose! What you are saying is right! But all these are legal formalities! Yes? -What are we supposed to do in all this work? Okay! -We just follow what Shastriji tells us! But I mean this is my-I mean this is.. ..a work related with ashram only. Then do one thing first! You talk with Shastri first! Now what is all this? Nothing..Now that grandpa is not there it's.. ..me who is looking after all his work! So this is a letter for that permission! That is anyway you'll have to do! What permission is needed for that? But everything needs to be put on paper.. ..for legal purposes! Isn't it? It is for that purpose I need it! -Okay! Okay! But all this text is in English! What? -Listen to my son! I don't know English! Besides, I don't understand anything in legal matters! So you do one thing! -What? You go and talk with Ganesh Shastri! I am always here for you! But when does Ganesh Shastri come? He always comes in Chaturmas season! Chaturmas means monsoon time! -What...what..which mass? What...which mass? Hello..do you know anything about what Guptaji spoke? Chatur? Chatter? Do you mean 'Chaturmas'? -Yes! Quite right! Chaturmas? -What is the meaning of Chaturmas? Chaturmas meaning...! It means four months! -I see! Four months! But which four months? Chaturmas means which four months? Hmmmmmm! You don't know! Go away! -Hello! I know! It is the month in which the pilgrims.. ..doing a parikrama come here! -Then tell me quickly! But when do the pilgrims doing a.. ..parikrama come here after all? -Hmmmmmm!-. You go away boy! During the month of monsoon! But when does the monsoon fall here? Wait! Wait! I'll tell you! I know that! I know that! I counted it! I know! Chaturmas begins after fifteen days! Fifteen more days? In this country with mosquito and humidity? Yes! Quite right! Girl, you forgot to calculate the days of 'Adhik Mass'. The additional month also! What is the meaning of this 'Adhik Mass'? -Thirty more days! What? Forty-five days? The Adhik-Mahina. Additional month is coming in between to be counted! What is this now? This is a machine to wash clothes! If you can do all this then please do.. ..something to get a network in mobile! That network signal doesn't reach here! -Then what? You need to go to a place called 'Indra-Sidhi' To get mobile network! -Inra-sidi. Inra-sidi. Inra yah! Whataver is that! How to go there? Go to the fig tree from above the bank! Turn right and you get another tree! Go straight from there till next tree! Go twelve steps from there and you.. ..get another place 'Saat-Bandh'! Mountains begin from there! Climb the mountain first to the top! Go walking stright from the top! Just a minute please.. It's confusing! -The starting point is from which tree? How far is remaining now? It is nearby only! What happened? -Banga? Mother Goddess is passing! Yes! It is the Mother Goddess only! Near the rocks she can be seen! Who is that? Is she any Goddess of yours? She is the Goddess of everybody here! The whole of our jungle bows before her! But about whom are you guys talking? About Mother 'Kaale-waali'! Hey Bittu? -Yes? -Come! Let us go and pay respects to her! Yes...sure! -Hello...no...no! First help me get a network for my mobile! Then even I will come to pay my respects to her with you! Mother doesn't meet anyone! -She won't even talk! Yes! Quite right! -And till the time she doesn't wish nobody.. ..except tribesmen can meet her here! Do you understand that? Hey just a second! Then how will you meet her? We are empowered to approach the Mother Goddess any time! Because our mother has spent her life.. ..in the service of this mother only! We are a part of the 'Saath-Saali' tribe! All this knowledge of worship has been.. ..taught to us by those tribesmen only! It is they only who have taught the art of.. ..drawing this picture on your forearm! 'Indra-Seedhi' is located nearby only! You can go walking there easily! -But...you see...! Hello...but which side am I supposed to go? Just stick to this direction only! This direction? Be quick! Get going! Bloody this direction! 'Indra Seedhi'! Hello? Hello? Yah, uncle! -Finally! Yes..tell me! -What are you saying? Uncle, grandpa has crossed the limit! He hasn't left a penny on my name but.. ..he has made such guys trustees! Hearing that you will go mad! -Karan..please calm down! Tell me exactly what has happened? This Supriya and Guptaji are okay but.. He has made Bittu-Banga as trustees! And Bandu fakir also! He is a fakir! You know a fakir! Who wears the garb of a beggar here! If they learn that millions of dollars are.. ..being transferred in their account then.. ..they will die on the spot by heart-attack! -Listen to me Karan! There is someone called 'Shastri' also! Who is he and where is he? I don't know anything about it! But everybody is telling me that if.. ..Shastriji signs we all will follow! -Now you tell me what to do? Tell me what to do? Hello.. Be at ease! Don't get up! Don't stand up! It is Mother Narmada's blessing that.. ..you didn't get hurt too much! You have been hit on the head but you will get well soon! But there is light injury on your foot.. ..in addition to some swelling there! But after I apply this paste everything will be fine soon! But where am I just now? You are in the laps of Mother Narmada! Kaalewaali Mother dropped you here! Kaalewaali Mother? -Yes! See! Assume that this your home only and.. ..relax here comfortably! Okay? But..I was at 'Indra-Seedhi'! Isn't it? Suddenly some goons came there and I don't know why he hit me! That was Dityo! Who? -Dityo! Dityo? -Dityo collects honey from the jungle! Okay! -He felt that you had come to shut down his livelihood! What? -And he thought that you were educating the.. ..people of ashram to domesticate honeybees! -Oh no....not me! Yes..not you..Laxman! Yes..right! -Yes...I know that! Dityo had misunderstood the matter That.. ..is why he ended up hitting you! Oh! -But Bittu-Banga have scolded him well! Shastri-uncle? Baldev..see who has come? Yes! I am coming! Is he Shastri? Om, May All become Happy,. May All be Free from Illness. May All See what is Auspicious,. May no one Suffer. Are you Shastri? I mean Shastri-uncle! You need not use formal terms! You can just call me 'Shastri'! Shastri-uncle! Shastri-uncle! Calm down! Calm down! What happened? Shastri-uncle! My mother has stopped eating food altogether! I don't understand what to do! She is too determined not to eat! Your mother will live for ten more years! You don't worry! But I'm bound to feel worried! She has not eaten anything for last four days now! Now you only tell me how can this go on? Yes! Yes! This is not proper.. ..she should eat! Right? Bhola! Tell your mother.. ..this is water from Narmada given by me as blessing. Don't you disrespect it! Shastri-uncle.. ..if my mother gets well I will take an oath for her! I will undertake a Narmada-Parikrama! Okay! Good! Go and make her drink this water! Go! Be quick! What? Bloody superstitious! Welcome! Welcome! God bless you! Good morning! -Good morning! Good morning! Hello..Guptaji? When did you come? -I heard you had fallen down in river? Did you drink the country-liquor? -What Guptaji? Are you alright now? Yah! I am..I am fine now! Did you withdraw money from bank? I am asking about the expense we.. ..incurred for the puja that day! -Oh..It is causing pain! Talk about it later! Yes! It must be paining a lot! What were you saying? No..nothing! You relax now! Okay! Okay! -We'll talk about it in the evening! -Okay! Okay! I will go to meet Shastri first! -Okay! I have brought fruits for you! Yah! Please...! It is good that you came! I am feeling a lot weak now! Shastri-uncle has asked you to take rest! You relax first! You need to take rest! We will meet later! -But....hello...? Oh no...please continue! I am sorry to disturb you but I was.. ..searching for Supriya and Guptaji! They have gone to take a holy view of the Narmada river! They must be coming! -Okay! Shastri-uncle? Are you sure I need not go to a doctor? I mean...my swelling has not subsided as yet! If you can come here walking on your own within.. ..a single day and yet you ask this? Be frank and come to the point! What do you want to know? Look! I am sorry to doubt on your remedies but...! Using only the water of River Narmada.. ..one can recover is...I mean! Oh yah! About Bhola? Ah...What? Ajwain and Rachko? Salary and Ulpha-ulpha for you! I added a few drops of these extracts in.. ..the water I happened to send to her! What it does is it repairs the digestive system.. ..and helps trigger hunger response.. ..in the patient and once he starts eating.. ..the body starts working automatically! Wow! That's great! You should have directly given medicine! Why did you philosophise reliogion in it? Because that lady can refuse drinking medicine.. ..but not Narmada river's water! Karan, this country has been surviving.. ..between two extremeties for ages now! At one end there are great learned men.. ..of a rich language like Sanskrit.. ..and at other end there are illiterate people.. ..also who call Indra as 'Indrani'! That is why this system of philosophising.. ..in terms of religion has evolved here! These people toiling whole day have no.. ..interest in scientific explanations! They understand the language of sins and.. ..blessings or sacred and evil only! That might be!But I have no faith in this religion etc.! That is not necessary either! It is okay if you don't have faith in religion! Yes! But an individual must have faith! This country has survived on the basis.. ..of spirituality and not religion! Our culture believes in updating the religion.. ..with changing times in life! We are the one who have faith in ultimate.. ..God and not in religion! Look..they have come! Yes..we have come! Good morning! I suggest Karan..you also go to.. ..seek blessings of Narmada river! No..there is no need to go walking anywhere! You just need to take rest! Yah! Okay! Okay! Shastri-uncle? -What happened now Bhola? My mother has started eating food! It is a nice thing then! What is it to worry about man? But now I will have to undertake a parikrama! Oh yah! Right! What was that oath? He had a lot of faith in taking oath! But don't worry Bhola! There must be some solution in religion! Right Shastri? What if he doesn't undertake a parikrama? Then I will be committing a sin! And then what if anything wrong happens to my mother? But when did you commit that you would.. ..immediately undertake a parikrama? You are free to do it whenever you.. ..may think it suitable in life! Besides, you are more needed to be here.. ..to first look after your mother! Yes! You go home peacefully and look after your mother only! -Go! Shastri? What advice did you give him? That will invite a big disaster! Once an oath is taken then it must be filfilled! Isn't it? God's mind is not so cheap! That it will immediately dictate a punishment.. ..if you don't fulfill an oath! Then assume that he won't ever undertake a parikrama now! Yes! A parikrama needs to be done only.. ..if there is enough faith in mind! Not just for the sake of fulfilling an oath only! River Narmada doesn't bind anybody! She flows freely! Likewise she emancipates everybody! Freedom is our birthright! Okay! Fine! How can I dispute what Ganesh-Shastri dictates about religion? God bless me! -Yah! But I have a question? Yes..tell me! Am I the only one who is worried about.. ..dinner or even you are craving for it? Come uncle! I'll help you in kitchen! Okay! Okay! Let us go! Please wait for me also! -God bless me! Yes! Come! That Karan was asking for a signature on some papers! Myself and Supriya are leaving for ashram! So you have a look at what he was asking! And yes..one more thing! Don't you go to the mountains during Chaturmas times! If Karan has come all of us will stay together in ashram! But till then he must last here! What? What do you mean? No..nothing..come let us go! God bless me! She is 'Vanita'! Supriya's mother! If she'd be living today I and Guptaji wouldn't.. ..worry about Supriya's marriage! I know about Supriya's father! But about her mother..? She became a nun! -What? She was a nun only! Even Supriya is a nun only! Can anyone become a nun by sacrificing one's own daughter? Religion is like addiction! Perhaps some debt of the previous life.. ..must be remaining unremitted! Do you believe in the past life? Do you believe in the present life? Hey...is this you? You look very handsome with hairs on your head! You mean..now I don't look handsome? No..no..it's not like that! And that's grandpa..right? Yes...this is a photo when he had undertaken a parikrama! What? Grandpa had undertaken a parikrama? -Yes! Unbelievable! So? Did he meet Reva in human form? What he got was very priceless! You possess the photos of everybody! Don't you have the photos of my parents? Grandpa never told me about who are my parents! Do you have any idea? Your grandpa knows it better! Why has your grandpa given all his wealth.. ..to the ashram instead of you? Yes? -These papers...! Isn't this the only reason why you were searching for me? Yes...yes..but how it reached you? How did this happen? When you came here this was the only.. ..thing that was left proper here! I have made the signature! I have full faith in you! Just like you..even I have the faith! When you'll go tomorrow I won't be there! Baldev will drop you at Harikot! I am looking forward to meet you at the ashram.. ..when I'll come there for Chaturmas! Everything else is left to your wishes! Mehta uncle! Congratulate me! The first and the most important signature.. ..of Shastri is obtained! Now everybody else's signs can be obtained very quickly! I am coming back soon! This Shastri seems to be a sensible fellow! He also appeared a little more faithful! He gave me a signature without asking.. ..me any further questions! Only for the sake of his faith! Any way..I will give rest of the details.. ..after returning to America! -See you soon! My next target is 'Gupta'! Give me! Show me where am I supposed to give my signature? At this place please! Where will I get to meet Bittu-Banga? We'll have to get an iron door after reaching the town now? Hey Bittu-Banga! Hey Bittu-Banga! We want money! Yes! But first finish my job! You had said that if Shastriji signs.. ..then even you will do the same! See this! Shastriji has given it! Will you give us some money for Ghal-sandi. -an iron door? Ghal...what? How much do you want? -Rupees two thousand! Only rupees two thousand? -Yes! -Yes..yes..I'll give you! Do your signature properly! It would have been nice if either one.. ..of you guys would become a trustee! What? With whom is he talking alone? Excuse me? -Shhhhh! Yes? What do you want? -You had said to me that you will sign.. ..if Shastriji offers his signature! Take this paper and give me your sign! Is this any work of the ashram? -Yes. Of course! It is related to the ashram only! -Did I say that? Yes, you had said that! -Promise! You had said that! What? Please give me your sign! Go away! Bandu fakir won't give his signature so quickly! Supriya! These plants have dried up...! Remove them and sow these new ones! Okay? And give water to each of them! Supriya? -Just a minute please! Add some fertilisers also! Yes...tell me? You don't wander in bright sunlight! Shastri uncle has told you to take rest! I will take rest only after returning to America now! -What? I mean..I will take rest! Are you going back? Well..hmmmm..the thing is! Sister?! Sister?! Supriya-sister? What happened Paka? What makes you so much excited? Puriya... An evil spirit has captured Puriya! Where is Puriya, Paka? Where is Puriya? Paka, where is Puriya? Paka...speak up! Where is Puriya? She is at the same place where an evil.. ..spirit is burnt alive every time! At the 'Karma-Shiksha' chowk! What? What is happening here? Zurka! Zurka! Go fast! Go! Supriya! Please tell me! What is happening here? It is being claimed that an evil spirit has captured Puriya! Very bad incident is going to happen! They will kill that poor girl now! -They will burn her alive! Come..Paka..run! Wait...wait! Paka, what is all this happening? An evil spirit has captured Puriya! So now Puriya has become woman of evil spirit! Now that evil spirit will cease only if she is burnt alive! Otherwise Puriya will kill everybody from our village! What are all these superstitions? Do you even believe this? It doesn't matter whether you or me believe this! We must reach there in time or else they will burn Puriya! They claim that Puriya has become an evil spirit! Now she doesn't have any right to stay in this jungle! Oh! Darn it! This is so insane! That is why in America.. ..India is known as a country of black magic! I am sorry! I am sorry! Shall we go to the police? It is of no use! -Even the nearest police station is 40 kms. Away! What the hell is this? Come! Let us go quickly! An evil spirit has captured my daughter! Aunty, stop crying and first tell me what happened? The boy of my elder daughter Rambali.. ..got lost yesterday morning! The whole village was searching for him! When Rambali saw in the morning that Puriya.. ..was weeping holding the half.. ..corpse of that boy -Laddo, in her laps! Where is Rambali? Rambali has ran away! Rambali has ran away? Why did you allow her to run away? Puriya has eaten that boy! She will eat Rambali also! How will an evil spirit spare anyone? You just sit here and I will go to the chowk and return soon! Darn it! -Wait! Wait! You! He was talking about his wife! How can these people burn someone alive? I will lodge a complaint with the police! We are killing an evil spirit! What has police got to do? Are we killing any living being? -Come! Let us go! Mother, we will take Puriya at a.. ..far off place from this jugle! I won't let her come here again! No! I won't let her go! We will have to kill her now when she.. ..has become an evil spirit now! They will cut her and then burn her! Aunty..she is your daughter! Bittu-Banga! Let us go! -Just wait a minute! Even I will come along! Even I want to meet Puriya! I am not going to meet Puryia! Please Karan! You stay back here only! -It is not safe! For God's sake you stay here only! Please don't interfere in this! Come! Let us go! Hey! You take me to Puriya! But sister has disallowed! -Didn't I tell you? Come! Let us go! Come...I say! Hello sir? What are you doing? Don't go near that evil woman! Who is evil woman? -She has become an evil woman! Puriya...what is all this? Come on...come with me! You go away from here! Else I will eat you! Don't you see? I've become a woman captured by an evil spirit! Are you mad? Stop talking nonsense! I am a woman of evil spirit only! Even my husband claimed that I'm a.. ..woman captured by an evil spirit! -Rambali also said! All the good villagers said the same! I have become a woman of evil spirit! Not only that but even Rambali's husband.. ..also said the same thing! I have become a woman of evil spirit! -I ate his son! Hey..hey! Because of you she is becoming ready to die today! She looks upon you as a brother! And do you think she will eat your son? Tell her that she is not a woman captured by some evil spirit! Hello sir? Enough is enough! This is a matter of our village! Allow us to look after our religious faiths and matters! What religious matters are yours? At one end you offer saree to a river and.. ..other end you are burning a girl alive? The evening is approaching and the strength.. ..of the evil woman will grow! -Just shut up! -Shut up you coward! Puriya? Spare him! Don't you beat him! I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! No evil spirit has captured me! A forest animal had eaten Laddu, the boy! I was only kissing his corpse! I was pleading before him to somehow open his eyes! I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! Brother, at least you believe in me! Did you listen her? Did you? Hello? Tie him down! Hey...! Hey..leave me! I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! Give me my bag! -I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! Begin the rites of sacrifice quickly! No! Don't burn my bag! I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! I am not a woman captured by evil spirit! Come! I have bound the evil spirit! I will carry it and bury it somewhere.. ..it won't ever come now to cause trouble to you people! Sit! Sit! Sit! -Where is Puriya? Puriya? Where is she? She is fine! -She is safe! What? -Kaale-Waali Mother has taken her into.. ..her Raani-Gufa (Queen's cave)! -You need not worry! But what will those people do with her? Do you mean, in the Raani-Gufa? In Rani-Gufa.. ..Puriya will be as safe as a fetus is in mother's womb. Okay? -Kaale-Waali Mother heself will look after Puriya there! Okay? Now you take rest! Take a little rest! You will feel nice! -No! No! I am fine! My bag? My bag? -What? Where is my bag? -Hello? Listen to me! Hello? Isn't it good that your life was saved? I had warned you not to interfere! You could have died there! You don't know what they can do! These idiot people were going to burn a living.. ..girl for the grip of blind faith! And do you expect me to keep looking.. ..at all this nonsense there? -She was almost killed! But the traditions here! Bloody hell with your stupid traditions! Is this your culture? Is this your birth-right for emancipation? At one end you boast about your rich heritage.. ..and ancient culture of India.. And on the other end you are behaving with.. ..an idiotic stupidity to kill anyone? Where is that Shastriji? Call him here immediately! He wants to have faith here? Isn't it? You keep hoisting the flag of your traditions.. ..in such stupid concepts! Forgive me please! I don't want to stay here! Uncle, whatever that happened here today I.. ..can't explain but one thing is decided! That these people are crazy! They had become so mad in mob mentality that.. ..they would've killed me also perhaps! Grandpa was wrong and I was, as usual, right! It's a country of the people who leave work and.. ..offer coconuts or flowers on a full moon.. ..night to do sacrifices to earn solace without.. ..sensing that they are polluting their rivers! I don't want to stay here even for a day now! Signs were all done almost! But the papers got burnt! I have no patience to get all the signs once again any more! I am coming back by next flight! I want my money in my account at any cost! Listen! How many dollars have you borrowed from them already? That negro had come into the hotel and.. ..he has destructed everything here! He has beaten me also a lot! He has given a credit of only one week! This is my last help to you! Go quickly get the sign of the trustees and return.. ..here with money immediately! Spare me from these dangerous negros.. ..after bring home the money, my dear! Where is brother-Karan? Hello Supriya..his bag is burnt! These papers with a few signs also have got burnt today! He was claiming that they were very important documents! See this! Only a few could be saved! Take this bag also! Okay! Supriya..I spoke with you a little too.. ..harsh under the stroke of anger! But the thing is I am in a big problem right now! I will have to complete a few formalities.. ..before leaving from here urgently! After looting the ashram's property.. ..and the hopes of the people here? -Supriya? You have stabbed us in the back! You have spoilt the grandpa's name! Here in the jungles only it is a custom.. ..to think of the others at every breath! It is the custom of this soil only! Anybody born here always talks of sacrificies.. ..and sufferings for others! You have frustrated me Karan! You have proved today that you don't.. ..belong to this mother soil here! Guptaji and Bittu-Banga.. ..everyone thinks of you as a successor of the grandpa! That is why they respect you today! I don't wish that the respect toward you.. ..in their minds reduces for any reason! They will feel terribly sad for that! And I do not wish to see them sad! But if you don't leave from here within.. ..two days then I'll tell everybody! -Supriya...listen! -I am...! Please....please leave! Please....please leave! -There is no need to do so much drama! The people here are as pure as the water of the River Narmada! Please...please don't pollute them! And yes..do send the document! I will sign it and courier it to you! Have you quarrelled with anybody? Yes? When I saw you first time I felt as if.. ..someone has mixed turmeric with tea! Turmeric is always nice but it deserves.. ..to be mixed with milk only! And not with the tea! I thought the son of the foreigner must.. ..have come here by mistake only! But when you staked your own life to.. ..save Puriya at that deadly place.. That time I felt that this is something only.. ..the grandson of the foreigner can do! Now I have started realising why Mother.. ..Narmada has called you here? If your Mother Narmada river has called me.. ..here then why didn't it give me what. I had sought to get from here? May be the right time may not have reached as yet! But Mother Naramada doesn't let anyone return empty handed! When I was doing the Parikrama of the River Narmada... That time my soul...! Parikrama? -Yes! Indeed! You are Maulana Ali-Baksh! Even you believe in Parikrama? Whether I become a sage or I become a drunkard! Where will the faith hidden in me vanish? Then has your faith helped you see.. ..the River Narmada in human form? Did you meet Reva? You yourself walk and see that! Do you want to come and see it? I do not believe in this Parikrama! What else you are doing except a Parikrama only? Immediately after birth.. ..the earth had started surrounding the sun! Likewise in every material object the.. ..rmotion is set on an atomic level! It is through this constant motion only that.. ..everybody evolves and blossoms in life! My dear Guru! You are right! Correct! Even I was in constant motion. I used to run around my grandpa during all my childhood days! To find out who were my parents? After growing I started running around.. ..to win money in life and now after.. ..continuing the run after run I have.. ..finally reached here at last! Here I ran around and around to win.. ..someone's heart and love now! But I have come across failure again! Total failure! Failure! Yes! Failure indeed! You become a failure only when you give up! When Draupadi's clothes were being snatched by Dushasan.. That time she had held her saree using.. ..one of her hands and using second.. ..hand she was pleading for Lord.. ..Krishna to come for her rescue! That time Lord Krishna didn't come! But when Draupadi begged for Lord Krishna.. ..upholding both of her hands.. ..then Lord Krishna came running! Till you have a doubt in mind you won't.. ..get to meet your God or your purpose! When you will have full faith and when.. ..you will raise both of your hands to.. ..beg for the mercy of your God it.. ..is only then...your God...! See! Today Mother River Narmada forced.. ..you to sleep in her close company? Isn't it? Where were you? Guptaji..I was going to tell you that! Don't you remember I am going to Amarkantak.. ..today to see a groom for my daughter? What? Now that I am going that far I thought I.. ..will also pay a visit to the pilgrimage? Yes..Yes! I just forgot that! Come! Come on! Come inside quickly! I was waiting for you only! Now at least take your seat man! -Yes..yes! Sit down please! Just like as I told you that I am going out today! And the pilgrims doing Parikrama also.. ..will start coming from today! So will you guys be able to look after.. ..all the work of the ashram? -Don't worry! We'll do it! Yes! We'll do it! But Guptaji, I need to leave within next two days! Where? Back to America! God bless me now! You are telling me now? My son, you've just started to understand.. ..the entire undertakings of the ashram! Yes..but some urgent work has come up! But if you are forcing me so much.. I can stay back here for a few days more! Okay? Listen to me son! I don't have right over you as much as.. ..it was like your grandfather could! But one thing I do say as a request! You stay here as long as I don't return! But uncle, when he is telling that he's.. ..having an urgent work then let him go! We all are here to look after the work! No..no! I can manage! Yes..He'll have to manage! Supriya, the pilgrims doing a Parikrama.. ..will come here in the ashram! Thousands of other works are there! If he stays back he will share some of our responsibilities! Isn't it? -But uncle, if he is going to stop then let.. ..him handle the task of welcoming pilgrims! Of course! -Isn't it? -Oh yes! Of course! -Yes! -Look at that! The pilgrims doing a Parikrama have started coming! May Goddess Mother Narmada bless us! May Goddess Mother Narmada bless us! May God bless you a long life! May God bless you a long life! May Goddess Mother Narmada bless us! Yes! Yes! Let us go! I can't stay here! I don't wish to stay here! There is another room here! -No man can stay here! Bittu-Banga! Wait! What's the problem sir? If you can't do proper service be frank to say it on face man! Do you insult the pilgrims walking in the.. ..Parikrama by showing such dirty rooms? Do you want to have a shortcut even.. ..to earn some sacred goodwill? The rooms are so dirty that even the stables.. ..of horses can't be made here! How can the pilgrims walking in a.. ..Parikrama stay at such places? Sir, I request, you eat your breakfast! Till that time I'll get the room cleaned! Yes! Get the room cleaned till then! God dwells only where cleanliness spreads! Got it? -Okay! Everything else is fine but I can't do this.. ..work of looking after the pilgrims! I've delegated the work to Bittu-Banga! Bloody arrogant, idiot! Are you asking about the pilgrim who was.. ..insisting to get the rooms cleaned? Yes! Have you met him earlier? Isn't he a man looking whom one can lose one's own balance? Service takes place not through brains but.. ..always through one's heart, my son! If you wish to earn goodwill by serving.. ..such men then go ahead and do it! I am not interested to earn any goodwill! These thousands of people are not serving.. ..the pilgrims doing Parikrama! They are doing only to preserve the tradition of Parikrama! It cannot be that you will offer service.. ..to someone because he is decent and.. ..refuse to serve someone because he.. ..is arrogant cannot be accepted! But forget it! No problem at all! What all these uneducated aborigines from.. ..this land of Reva can heartily do.. ..can't be done by educated men like you! I will do it! He has started feeling affectionate.. ..for the local landscape and people! He has started liking the fragrance of.. ..the local soil and the culture here! The mind is echoing to the local ethos apparent here! The mind is echoing to the local ethos apparent here! The affection of the village is creating warmth in mind! He has started liking the fragrance of.. ..the local soil and the culture here! You cannot do even a single work properly! Do you know that once again new.. ..documents will have to be made! It takes 15 days to send the papers by courier.. ..after getting them from a lawyer! No problem uncle because as it is even.. ..I have to stay back here for 15 days! I have some work to do here! Someone is huffed with me! -I will have to deal with that. -What? I mean one of the trustees is huffed! Some conflict has taken place! I will have to pamperthat person to.. ..obtain the signature on papers! What about that Savio will pounce on me.. ..till the time you pamper someone there? Uncle, you have helped me a lot! -See...this time...! Now don't you burden me with your expenses.. ..taking place there! Please. Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Okay! What is the matter now? Ration! What? -Kamalaba was telling me that.. ..the stocks are finished now! Arrangements will have to be done! I have already signed the document! -What? Try to manage everything in whatever.. ..you guys can try to put together! We'll see what needs to be done! Keep suffering and live with the trouble! But keep flowing like water of the river. Keep asking whatever comes to your mind.. ..answers to all your questions, you will find. The mind that has become dry and parched! It will soon blossom with greenery now! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! That day I hit you by mistake! But what do I do? I climb on the trees up to the height.. ..of 50-60 feet to gather honey! Now if people start making honey at leisure.. ..by these boxes how will I survive? Today he fell down from a height of 20 feet.. ..and has got fractured his arm now! Now stop climbing on the trees! I will also rear honeybees using a box! We will gather honey in the boxes only! Please give one box to us also! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! You are in the same pot where it.. ..is floating in the same ocean! You have found your God now in the same soil and stones here! Uncle, I went to work in a farm for.. ..the first time in my life today! And I slipped down in mud then! And everybody was laughing a lot on me! These people are so innocent that they.. ..cannot even hide their feelings! Their innocence made me also to laugh in joy with them! I worked with these people for 2-3.. ..hours in the agricultural farm! And then I developed a hell of a lots of pain in my back now! I just worked for doing a change but how.. ..those who this daily must be suffering? Their work will become easy if these people.. ..get latest farming technology! Can you help? Brother Karan? -Yes? This is the money to buy ration grains in the ashram! From where did you get this money? -Supriya has given it to us! Supriya has given it? -Yes! She'd saved this money for musical orchestra.. ..but she spared this money for.. ..buying grains because this year no money.. ..will come as a grant for the ashram! Then how is she going to conduct.. She was saying that she is not in any mood.. ..to conduct musical orchestra this year! -No! She very much wants to conduct a musical orchestra! But she is definitely hiding something! I suspect she was weeping! -Am I right? -Yes! Quite right! Okay! We will do something! The mind that has become dry and parched! It will soon blossom with greenery now! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! You are a drop in the ocean and ocean in the drop. You are the diamond and you only the rock. You are the traveller and you only the destination.. ..you are the path and you only the companion. You are a drop in the ocean and ocean in the drop. You are the diamond and you only the rock. You are the traveller and you only the destination.. ..you are the path and you only the companion. Wake up you pilgrim please! What are you searching for? You are not realising that what you.. ..are searching for is yourself only! Wake up you pilgrim please! Musical orchestra would be a great fun if a.. ..singer like Puriya will also be present? Yes!Just a minute! I know Puriya cannot come here but you.. ..guys can go to the 'Sath-Saali' caves? Please take me there once guys? I do want to meet her! -Let me at least see whether she's fine? Please guys...take me there! No! You can't go there! Forget her please! -Forget her please! Forget her please! But please listen to me guys! Supriya? -Yes? Why don't you come to sing? You are the best singer! You come to sing and brother-Karan will play his guitar also! Can't you see I have lot of work to do? Why do you keep working the whole day? Brother-Karan has said that if you sing the.. ..musical orchestra will be a great fun! Didn't you hear me that I have lot of work to do now? You go away now! Who will go to distribute the invitations.. ..in the surrounding villages from here? -Yes? I will go to Chatti-tola and Timba-tola.. ..villages but not to the Kanha villages! Why? Why won't you go to the Kanha villages? He is afraid of going because of.. ..the tigers in the Kanha forests! Tiger? -Tigers are there but nowadays one tiger.. ..from there has become a man-eater! I heard that he attacked the daughter.. ..of the Naik on the full moon night! Hello guys! You don't worry! -Everything will be fine! Yes! Bittu-Banga will go to the Kanha villages in forest! The musical orchestra is taking place for.. ..the first time after your father's death! Yes! -But you don't seem to be happy! No uncle! Nothing like that! Okay..fine! What happened? There are some questions in your mind! No! Nothing like that! The question in your mind is why did I sign.. ..Karan's papers despite knowing everything? Didn't you ever think even once about the.. ..residents of the ashram before signing? Who will take away whatever that is there in the destiny.. ..my dear Supriya? And even though I've signed the papers.. ..look at now what is the picture today? He has opted to stop here! Although he has stopped I doubt that.. ..is also out of selfishness only! Now that the papers are burnt! What if he gets another copy of the.. ..papers then what will he do? Then do whatever you think is right! Have all the invitations been delivered? -Yes! Sure! -Yes! Sure! Then why these Bittu-Banga haven't reached as yet? Karan! Come fast to the hospital! What? Bittu? Banga, what happened? His neck is injured and so he is not able to talk anything! Keep calm! Keep calm! Don't you have any senses? Why didn't you stop somewhere when it was an evening already? Why was there any need to return? Keep calm! Keep calm! Please..doctor..doctor! Tiger has bitten him on the neck and.. ..therefore lot of blood has flowen! I didn't let anything happen to him! I was there with him only! Keep calm! Keep calm! When the tiger attacked Bittu I dashed and made him run away! Nothing will happen to him! -Okay! Calm down! Calm down! Doctor..please do something! You leave the doctor! Let him do something! Calm down! Calm down please! Doctor..please do something! I won't go out now! You come with me outside! No! I won't go out now! Come with me! Come! -Oh my dear Bittu! I won't go out now! Sister? -We'll take him to the hospital in the.. ..city of he does not improve here! Whatever it will cost I will remit.. ..the expense by working here! -Calm down! Calm down please! We don't have time to take him to a hospital in the city! We'll have to give him a best treatment here only! Why urban doctor but I will get the best.. ..doctor from America also to give him.. ..a best best treatment but I'll cure him! But you don't worry about him! May Mother Goddess Narmada bless him! Bittu! Bittu! Banga, we can take the dead body.. ..on tomorrow morning only, Banga! Don't say 'Banga' only Guptaji! Say 'Bittu-Banga' only! Yes! Bittu-Banga! Six days have passed for our Bittu to have passed away! But its still unbelievable! Brother-Karan! That pandal owner has come! He must have come to decorate the stage! But I wonder whether we should conduct.. ..the musical orchestra now! I am unable to...? What happened? Only two days are remaining for the.. ..musical orchestra to be held! Don't you want to do any practice? Leave it now! Leave it! Yes..now it is standing! Yes..good! Now there won't be a problem! Okay! Let us go! Brother-Karan? -Yes? You have done a lot for me! I have brought something for you! You had got acquainted first with Puriya in this ashram! I'll take you to meet Puriya but only once! You be ready at night of the musical.. ..orchestra and I'll take you to her! Thank you! Thank you Bittu-Banga! Can we talk for two minutes? Yes of course! Tell me! Thank you Karan! For supporting Banga like a brother.. ..after the sad demise of Bittu! Thank you for associating with the work of.. ..the ashram and revitalising everybody! Thank you for fulfilling my dream of.. ..conducting a musical orchestra! Is this a genuine compliment or a sarcasm? It is a genuine compliment! We are the people staying with nature! Telling lies is not in our culture! And tolerating lies also doesn't fit in our nature! Now this is a sarcasm! Doing all this is not necessary Karan! The papers you had sought have arrived from America now! And I have already obtained everyone's signature.. ..to reduce your troubles also! So now you need not do all this drama! Now you go from here as early as possbile! You still don't trust me? My mind believes in you! That I should trust you once more! But now these papers of yours have arrived from America now! Uncle Mehta has sent them not me! Please Karan! -Please! My mind doesn't have strength to withstand even a single lie! Before all these people come to know.. ..the truth about you..please go! You can go after the musical orchestra gets over! Papers! I plead before my beloved partner that.. ..I have become a nun to serve! I set my eyes on your path O Lord Krishna my beloved! I plead before my beloved partner that.. ..I have become a nun to serve! I set my eyes on your path O Lord Krishna my beloved! When will you come O Lord Krishna? We are craving for your arrival o dear! Please don't make us yearn like this! O Lord Krishna my beloved o dear! Please don't make me yearn to meet.. ..and get blended with you o dear! Life is like a mysterious fire like a rhyming tune burning! A lot many anger and many questions are.. ..hidden today even in my mind dear! Even I am wandering on earth like a bolstering ocean here! Who on the face of this earth knows.. ..the meaning of my questions? Life is like a mysterious fire like a rhyming tune burning! A lot many anger and many questions are.. ..hidden today even in my mind dear! Even I am wandering on earth like a bolstering ocean here! Who on the face of this earth knows.. ..the meaning of my questions? Someone is sage and someone is in rage! Someone is infected and someone is king! Someone is wicked and someone is capable! Someone is inferior and someone is superior! No one here is immortal! Whether you are a diamond or a coal soil.. ..is the destination of your soul! Then why should one bother about all these drama? Apply medicine to the one who is injured! Give water to the one who is parched! Live the life in such a manner that.. ..even the death will be ashamed! The one who knows how to win the hearts.. ..will live even after death! Neither there will any sword live nor.. ..an arrow will survive in life! Then why should one bother about all these drama? Then why should one bother about all these drama? Whether you are a diamond or a coal soil.. ..is the destination of your soul! Then why should one bother about all these drama? Puriya? You need to wash your feet here first! Okay! I am possessing this and I wish to meet Puriya! But first you wash your feet! I wish to meet Puriya! I am having this...! Didn't you learn as yet to forward the right hand? Puriya? Finally...! How are you? I am fine! How about you? -I am also fine! I was really very worried about you! You don't worry about me at all! 'Kaale-Waali' Mother looks after.. ..all of us really very well here! -Really...I mean it! And we, all of us, treated one and the same here! Someone is either an orphan or someone else.. ..stays here because dowry problems! This is a 'Raani-Gufa' (Queen's Cave) and.. ..all of us are 'Queens' of this premises! Forget about all that! -You first tell me how is Supriya? She is fine! She remembers you a lot! Have you spoken with her anything? Or is it that you haven't disclosed yet? What? -Why are you staring at me like this? I know you like her a lot! Yes!But I am returning now! Why? Are you going back to America? Yes! -Why? Just like that! Okay...now that you have come here do.. ..come and meet Mother 'Kaale-Waali'! No...but I have heard that she does not meet anybody! The fact that you have come so far means.. ..Mother 'Kaale-Waali' wants to meet you! Now just follow me! Is it? Okay! Now wear your shoes! -Yes! She is Mother 'Kaale-Waali'! She is 'Vanita'! Supriya's mother! She became a nun! What? -She was a nun only! Welcome Karan! Please sit! Karan? Hello Karan? I need to show you the accounts of yesterday! Karan..? Dosi, did you see Karan anywhere? No! Today morning he has not come even for eating breakfast! What? -He wanders nowadays with Bittu-Banga only! He must have taken him somewhere! Okay! Okay! Where has he gone? Hey...Tempuriya? Come here! Go to Bittu-Banga and tell him that Guptaji.. ..is calling him in the office! -Go...run! Where has he gone? I am searching for him since today morning! I need to show these accounts! I wonder where has Karan gone? And even our Shastriji! Just told me that he's going for a bath in Narmada and gone! He has not returned as yet! I am feeling tempted to ask which such place has he gone? Take me also there! Yes? Girl..are you listening to me or am.. ..I just talking alone myself to a wall? Look at him! He has come! He is a replica of another! Where is he? -Who? -Karan! Where is brother-Karan? Karan won't come here now! What? Karan won't come because he has left the ashram now! What is this you are talking my dear? I am telling you the truth uncle! Karan hadn't come to look after grandpa's.. ..work but only for taking our signatures! So that he gets all the property of his grandpa! I have given all the documents to him.. ..yesterday night which you had signed! What? Today morning he has left from ashram! With him and may be this ashram will also be gone soon.. Where is Karan? Where is Karan? Mr. Mehta? -Yes! Of course! I am Mehta only! Please call Karan here! He is not there here! -What? He has returned back! -Don't lie! I know he is here only! How can he give up such a huge property? He has not given up all the property but he.. ..has taken all the documents of ashram! Impossible! During his last call itself he had himself told me that! Mehta-uncle.. ..please inform this message of mine.. ..to the grandfather's lawyers! I don't want anything from the property! Please transfer all the money into.. ..the account of the ashram now! And I'm really very sorry for all the trouble! For some time I won't come back! I will be staying here only! But I will be fine! Don't worry about me! Bye! You are telling me that Karan is not here! He has not returned to America also! Then... Where is Karan after all? Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Sorry! I am sorry! Keep it! Keep it with you only! I have already read that! I am reading it for second time now! Are you sure? -Yes! I am sure! I am little slow in Gujarati language! -Yes! I can see that! How? -That is why you didn't recognise me? What? -No..nothing! Please read this book peacefully! Go to its depth slowly! I know you! I have see you earlier somewhere! -Forget about that introduction! Forget about that! I am only a pilgrim now going for a Parikrama! You've undertaken a Parikrama at this age? I have shot too many selphies at this age, my dear brother! Now I am on my journey to discover my own self! Good! Thank you! Okay! Even I will leave now! Are you a pilgrim doing a Parikrama? I have no idea! Mother Revaa! God know who first started a Parikrama of River Narmada! And then started this novel tradition! Even today this tradition is going on! It is not a meaningless tradition but.. ..indeed a very meaningful tradition! If it was meaningless it cannot last for centuries! The tunes of flowing River Reva echos.. ..the sounds of ancient sages! I love watching this daughter of Mekal in the.. ..day and I am fond of its sound in the night! If it is a visual to be seen in the day.. ..and the music to be heard at night! In the day it is Narmada and at night its Reva! In your sound of the flow the voices of sages are blended! In your sound of the flow the voices of sages are blended! In the day you are Narmada and at night you are Reva! In the day you are Narmada and at night you are Reva! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Welcome sir! Welcome! Please have some tea made with milk of mother Narmada! Mother Narmada's milk? -Yes! My cow's name is 'Narmada'! Oh....I see! I was just closing my shop in the evening! But it seems this last cup was meant for you only! Take it! -Thank you! Are you going on a Parikrama? Hmmm....Yes! Me and my cow Narmada also have completed a Parikrama! This cow has completed a Parikrama? Yes! When we started from Amarkantak she was a little calf. By the time we reached the end of the.. ..Parikrama near sea it became a cow! Right! But now the Chaturmas. -Four months of monsoon has started! Have you made any arrangements to.. ..stay somewhere at night? -No! -Then please come at our temple! It is located very near from here! No, I don't want to stay here! -Please stay for tonight! It is evening now and there is no guarantee.. ..when the rains will start! And sir..please give me also a chance.. ..to earn a little sacred goodwill! Okay! Fine! Let us go! Panditji..a pilgrim walking in a Parikrama has arrived here! I....I remember you! We had met earlier! Right? Yes! At Dungarpur river bank! Yah! -You walked all the way just to check my selfie? This is a Mahant. -a sage here! Oh! Hello! -I mean..Namaste -Nice to meet you! Anybody who goes for a Parikrama.. ..during a Chaturmas is our guest! Please take bath and refresh yourself! Next we'll do evening prayer and chat! Go and tell the cook to prepare some.. ..sweet dish at night for dinner! So far the journey ws smooth but now.. ..the area of Shulpan will start. It takes 2-3 days to pass through that.. ..area and we come across the Kabas. The tribals! They loot the pilgrims! I havent experienced this.. Let me have this experience too.. I am not joking my dear friend! Ask him? Haven't you been looted by the Bheels. -the tribal people? Of course! Not only me but the had looted my cow also! All the ornaments that were there on.. ..my cow were fully looted by them! What if they would have looted the cow also? -I would rather die.. ..than let them take the cow away. -But don't worry my son! You need not worry at all! I am staying here for last ten years! I haven't heard even a single example of a.. ..pilgrim who got lost in the jungles here.. ..one or other way, he gets the shelter! I will manage to pass from there! A pilgrim going on a parikrama passes from there.. ..just like a newborn child comes out of a womb! He comes out full naked from there! That is better! It will be as if one is reborn in a new world! Destiny and time is stronger than the human beings indeed! Using the same bows and arrows tribals have.. ..looted even historical King Arjun! Looting the pilgrims is the duty.. ..of the tribals and they do it! The only thing I know is that whatever.. ..I get robbed with returns to me later! And even if we don't get back anything yet.. ..Mother Narmada is always there with us! Our Mother Narmada never sleeps.. ..and she keeps flowing smoothly! May I ask you something? When you had met me first time you were an atheist! You had no faith in religion that time! I don't know about the religion.. ..but I have developed faith now! Excellent! Only a true atheist can become a true believer! But what so great happened that you embarked upon a Parikrama? You....You? Yes! I am only Kalewali Mother! And I am the same lady 'Vanita' who gave birth to Supriya! And now I have become a Mother of this whole jungle! How you became Kalewali Mother -a nun! Circumstances! What kind of circumstances forced you.. ..to stay away from your daughter and your husband? Supriya's father had convened a very big musical.. ..concert at the time of her birth! In the morning I heard the sound of.. ..an infant wailing very strongly! I saw that a big Jackal was snatching.. ..a little child deep into the forest! I chased that Jackal in the jungle! The Jackal perhaps saw a danger in me and.. ..it dropped the child and vanished! I lifted that infant in my arms! That poor child was crying and yelling because of pain! So I tried to calm it down! But the villagers who came running there.. ..thought that I was eating that child! They assumed that an evil spirit had entered in me! So just like Puriya preparations.. ..were started to burn me alive! But the 'Kalewali Mother' of my times.. ..saved me and brought me here! I am really sorry for that! Supriya's father Suren now had the responsibility.. ..of a single parent of Supriya! My beloved Supriya had a mother but.. ..still she had to live without me.. ..you both suffered from such grave miseries.. ..just for the sake of an unknown child! By the way, did that child survive? Yes! Do you know how this mark on.. ..your forearm came into being? Give everything that you possess! Remove your clothes also! Don't take that! Don't take that! Give me that! Please give that back to me! You cleanse lakhs of sins with your river body.. ..which is beautifully decorated by lakhs of swans. In that holy place.. ..you give both prosperity as well as.. ..liberation to the humans and animals. The presence of Brahma.. ..Vishnu and Shankara in your holy river.. ..body provides the protective shield. O devi Narmada.. ..I bow down to your lotus feet, please give me your refuge. By this time he must have crossed the.. ..tribal's area during the parikrama.. ..you have instilled faith in the hearts of many.. ..you have instilled faith in the hearts of many.. ..and took away all the pain and.. ..agony with your flowing water.. ..and took away all the pain and.. ..agony with your flowing water. Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! You flow so swiftly with your pure water! In this world.. ..the one who is.. ..humble, seeker, kind, generous,, sacred, peaceful, balanced. As well as protector of unity.. ..alone deserves to seek final emancipation! What mark is this on your forearm? The Jackal had caught hold of you here at the forearm! The marks of the wound on your forearm used.. ..to make you cry out of severe pain! To hide those marks I tattooed the.. ..symbol of the 'Saath-Saali'! That means it is because of me you and Supriya.. ..are suffering from these pains! You need not feel sad Karan! I feel all these incidents are only mere pretexts in life! This was my destiny! My parents! I mean..my mother and father! You must be surely knowing who were they? I don't know who was your father but.. ..your mother is River Narmada! Three years before this incident of the.. ..Jackal you were found to your grandpa.. ..while he was travelling while doing.. ..his parikrama of the River Narmada! That means grandfather has hidden many things from me in life! Didn't you hide from others your true motive of coming here? Your grandfather was afraid that after you.. ..would learn the truth you would go away! That is why he kept it a secret! Karan, always remember one thing! If your grandfather wouldn't have adopted you.. ..then you'd have become a tribal today! Or you would have been eaten by.. ..some wild animal in the jungle! Destiny has donated you a chance to survive twice! There must be some reason for that! Even after this if you feel.. ..you alone hold the right over your grandfather's property then.. ..go back to your country and take away all the wealth! Perhaps this alone could be the desire of Mother Reva! Mother Narmada may bless us all! All my expectations from life were proved false by you! Now I can understand.. That all these incidents were mere pretexts! Just to bring me here! But as long as I don't experience.. ..you even I will not go from here! I won't believe in. In this world, the one who is,. Humble,. Seeker,. Kind,. Generous,. Sacred,. Peaceful,. Balanced. As well as protector of unity,. Alone deserves to seek final emancipation! Hello Mehta-uncle? How are you? Hey Karan? How are you my boy now? I am fine! Can you see? Shastriji's herbal medicine has made.. ..my recovery very fast indeed! -How nice! The place where all of you had found me! From the same place I am going to resume my parikrama again! And don't worry about me because even.. ..Supriya is going to join me now! Bye for now! Normally pilgrims begin the journey of the Parikrama.. ..from a temple or famous river bank! But why are we beginning the Parikrama from this place? Because your faith was true! That day when all of you found me here while being ill! Before that! Take this and eat! Take this and eat! Take this and eat! Who are you? Reva..!
