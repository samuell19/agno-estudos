Of course not Building construction concerns people's lives and safety Those are the most important concerns Yes, that's right, thank you for your explanation Are there certain requirements for building materials? Mrs. Zhang, that's funny It goes without saying we have a specialized department in the company responcible for quality control of materials So manager Lai knows materials are important Of course I am responsible for my department Manager Lai Please enjoy your dinner Let's go No stay Sit Don't worry Sit Let's continue One mushroom for Xing Xing So wasteful There's seafood They will be happy to see this Let's get a lobster head I can use it for soup Zhang Tao! Are you out of your mind? How could you let this get out of hand? You can't even control your wife! Are you a man?! Dumb loser! How dare you say that to him? Mrs. Zhang you are a housewife So you better Get out of here you damn bitch! What are you doing? Your words and behavior can be regarded as a personal attack I can sue you! So sue me! You are dishonest and you expect others to be the same? What are you saying? The previous president paid you well, didn't he? I bet you took even more from the contractors You better watch your mouth! Otherwise I will tear it apart! How dare you! How dare you! I finally did it I wanted to do this long ago Sweetie You are a true man! I am very happy today Cheers! Don't drink too much Let's talk about our dreams Our dreams? Aren't they all buried under our family life? It's just two of us Come on What about yours? You were the top in our class What are your dreams? Xing Xing accidentally came into our life You chose to keep her instead of going abroad You chose to marry me Have you regretted it all these years? Why would I? Do you remember the day when we had dinner in a restaurant after school? We finished the whole bottle of Liquor You could only handle one glass It's very embarrassing I still remember you dragging me to my dorm in the heavy snow How could you How could you know all about my past? Of course I know I remember everything about you even if I was drunk Cheers Bottoms up I can take it Let me go check What's wrong? What was the loud noise? Nothing I hurt my nose I am going to bed What happened to your face? Look at her face! Nothing! - It's nothing - What happened to your face? I want to go to bed Your face is injured! Did you have a fight with your classmates? Nothing happened, just leave me alone What happened? Leave me alone! Let me see - Leave me alone - Let me see Stop it Let me handle it Who did this to you? Leave me alone! I will take care of her You wait outside Xing Xing Does it hurt a lot? It's Wei Yi who did this, isn't it? Don't worry Mom is here Everything will be fine Hello? This is Mrs. Zhang He hit someone? You have seen this for yourself As long as my clients want we can send Mr. Zhang to jail Don't think you can threaten me Even if I do end up in jail I still needed to give him a lesson You still want to attack him? Don't you know there are laws in our country? His injured face is clear evidence My client is 17 years old My daughter is injured as well She was assaulted Yet you don't mention a word about it? If no one has taught him manners I will beat him until he learns some Who are you talking about? All right, all right Everyone take a step back We can smoothly sort this out Not a chance! You can sue me Mr. Zhang we are all angry at what happened to these kids Is it worth it? We simply believe that given what has happened it is not worth a lawsuit He almost raped my daughter! You are a woman, too! The most important thing for a lawyer is evidence You have no evidence to prove that it's not just a young couple playing around I will be back Are you all right? I am fine Let's go back, I believe he will apologize Let's go! I will handle this You? Trust me Continue I think we should rationally consider what's best for both sides Don't you agree? Certainly From the girl's perspective I suggest we shouldn't make this a big deal Reputation is very important for girls Perhaps some people don't care about it at all Besides About the kids I am afraid there is some misunderstanding Adults tend to complicate things It's better to let it go for both sides Zhang Tao did hit your client Even if he did it on purpose considering your client is under 18 this is a civil dispute In a civil dispute if we agree to your terms this case will be dropped If we don't my husbad will be in jail for a few days at most What your client did is attempted rape Attempted rape is an indictable offence The police will investigate Prosecutors will file a lawsuit Then the court will adjudicate Even if you try to bribe me or I change my mind the case can't be withdrawn This is a legal society you don't get to decide After all, he is a kid Any kid can lose control once My point is shouldn't we give him a chance? We don't need him to go to jail However, he is not a child anymore should be able to tell right from wrong Where are his moral principles? Who do you think you are? Are you talking about my son? Please! Stay quiet for a moment We want him to apologize to apologize to Zhang Xing Ze in person Also, swear he won't do it again to any other women That's fine, we will consider your terms Not a chance! How can I admit something I didn't do? You pretended to have a date with a girl In fact, you invited a group of boys told her to take off her clothes in public Do you dare to deny what you have done? Who will believe you? Do you know Xing Xing's classmate Wen Ling? If we make this news spread among the girls I believe we'll easily get more witnesses How dare you! My father will ruin you Say you are sorry! Let go! Say it! I am sorry I warn you I can sue you at any time Watch your behavior! Are you all right? You saw everything I want to sue her Mom It's gonna be okay It's gonna be okay Mom I don't want to go to school tomorrow People will laugh at me You didn't do anything wrong I'm scared of falling in love again Real love is worth a risk, be brave It's such a wonderful thing to fall in love with someone Don't be afraid Have faith you will find love I used to think I could live well alone When I was in high school a boy called Zi Jun liked me a lot He came to my home with a big bunch of flowers I can still recall that night it was snowing What happened afterwards? I didn't accept his affection Why not? I was proud and arrogant I didn't believe in love I haven't seen him since then Do you still think of him sometimes? Occasionally But his face has become very vague to me Dad must be so special that you fell in love with him I am leaving Xing Xing Sweetie Take this with you You look good - Let' go - Wait! Only ten today Ten is not enough! - Hurry up! - Thanks, mom - We are leaving, bye bye - Be careful on the way Tian Tian, quick! We are late What's wrong? Mom I can't see Don't kid with mom We are late I am not kidding I really can't see anything I am scared Don't be scared Don't be scared Tian Tian Hold tight Don't be scared Don't be scared When did the symptoms start? We think his situation worsened in a short time What should we do now? The standard procedure requires an operation However, he is too young The operation carries a high risk You can take time to think about it Be strong, my son! Mom Don't worry I Will stay with him Okay Don't be afraid Mom, you are back, aren't you? Mom wait for me Don't leave me again Mom will wait for you Mom will keep this for you Tian Tian, you can do it! Everything is ready We can send you back now Slop!

To chase the truck Are you going to take me back to life or to death? It will be a big trouble if you're not sent back in time Do you even know how to drive? Don't you want to start your beautiful life in Germany? Trust me I trusted you And that's how I got here Didn't you cry when saying goodbye to that family? I am in a bad mood Don't mess with me Really? I think you are good at being a mom You are not young why don't you get married?
