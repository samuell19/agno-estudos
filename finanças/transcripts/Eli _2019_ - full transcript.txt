Dad! Dad! Dad! It burns! Aah! Dad! No! Eli? Eli? Are you okay? Had the same dream. The one where you thought you were cured? Yeah. You will be, honey. That's why we're doing this. Just one more drive to go, okay? - Promise? - Promise. We'll be there before sunset. I mean about being cured. Cross my heart. You know I love you, right? I know. Also declined. What's that? Declined. That's all I got. Three people, two nights? That's 240. We stayed one night. Nice watch. Let's go. Burning daylight. We're ready. Come on, honey. Holy shit, dude. Check that out. - What the fresh fuck is that? - Ha ha ha ha ha. Houston, we have a problem. Hey, spaceman, what planet are you from... Uranus? Uranus. Eli. Come here... honey. Ah. It's me. It's okay. Mom. Mom, it's ripped. Mom, it's... It's ripped. Get the tape. - It's okay. I got him - He's gonna pass out. Eli, you're okay. I got it. Breathe, Eli. - I'm sorry. - Eli, calm down. Take it easy. Breathe, honey. Eli, look at me. I'm right here. Real tough, assholes, picking on a sick kid. Don't look at them. It's just you and me, okay? Hey, don't look at them. Look at me, okay? Breathe. - Go grow up. - Breathe, honey. Can you smell that birthday cake fresh from the oven? All right, breathe in. Smell it? Blow out those candles. Purse your lips. That's it. Good. There's a couple more left. Blow 'em out. That's good. Now make a wish. What did you wish for? I wish I could beat the crap out of them. Make another wish. That Dr. Horn can fix me. Should we get out of here? - Come on. - See ya, man. - Blast off. - Yeah. Bye. Shit. Asshole. - Piece of shit. - The old car never did that. I wasn't talking about the car. I was talking about you. Paul. What? He knows I'm kidding. But we did need to tighten our belts to get you to this doctor, pal. I know. Well, she's gonna be worth every penny. She's a miracle worker. Right? - Are you gonna show me my card or not? - Oh. Is... this your card? That is my card. How'd you do that? It's not your card. You're lying to me to make me feel better. Calm down. I wouldn't lie to you, baby. Right, Paul? - He's nervous. - I know. I miss DC. Is this where we're staying? - It is, buddy. - Yep. Just for a little while. Hey, get your stuff. Let's go. Where's the doorbell? I don't know. Welcome, Miller family. This is Dr. Horn. In order to protect the integrity of the house, the decontamination chamber is our only way in or out. Eli, will you please enter first by yourself? We'll be right behind you. - You're okay. - You got this. Raise your arms, please. Hello, Eli. I'm Dr. Horn. Hello. Rose. Paul. - Nice to meet you in the flesh finally. - Dr. Horn. - These are my nurses... Barbara, Maricela. - Pleased to meet you. Did you find the place okay? - Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Miller. - Call me Rose. We're so happy to have you out here. You're in good hands. - I know. - It's so lovely here. I find the isolation is good for the soul. Excuse me. You can take your suit off now. You're safe. - What if there are contaminates? - There aren't any. This is a clean house. - He's a little shy. - There's no rush. You have to trust yourself first. Will you fetch the Millers' luggage? - Right away. - Absolutely. Please, follow me. I'll show you your room. - How long will it take? - The treatment? We do it in three stages. It's called Viral Gene Therapy. You see, your immune system produces too many bad immunoglobulin... My body carries a defective RAG1-RAG2 gene. Which we can correct using an encoded virus. - You really know your stuff. - I read. Rose and Paul, you'll be on this floor, but we're gonna go to Eli's room first. Can't he sleep with us? Unfortunately, our patients must be in their own rooms for treatment. - How long have you been a doctor? - I've been an immunologist for 25 years, but I started this clean house three years ago. How many patients have you treated? Quite a few. And you've cured all of them? Hmm? And you've cured all of them? Eli, I know you're nervous, but you don't need to be. I will make you better. Don't worry about that. That's the sound of the air filtration. Sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate. This is an old house. It had been abandoned for God knows how long before I bought it. Shall we? What's down there? Not all of the house had been retrofitted to be a clean environment. But don't worry. These seals are airtight. Shall we continue? Eli. This is your room, Eli. I know it's a lot to get used to, but I hope you don't think of this as a medical facility. To me it's a home, and for now, it's your home. Is the water safe? The water here is completely filtered, purer than bottled water. Probably a long time since you've had a shower. You can trust Dr. Horn, honey. Breathe. It's okay to breathe. It's okay. That's it. Oh, it's been so long. I love you. I know. Mwah. Where'd you get that? It's for him to wear when we go home. Do you like it? Did you see his face when he took off the suit? He was so happy. You remember? Happy? Hmm? - I just got a lot on my mind. - I know. But this is gonna work. Everything we hoped for. Everything I prayed for is right here. He's gonna get better. We just gotta have faith. I do. I've always been a faithful man. Hi. Do you want to come in? Eli? My God, you're shaking. Can I sleep in your bed tonight? Good morning, Eli. How are you feeling? - Okay. - I heard you didn't sleep well. There was something in my room. - What was it? - I don't know. Like... breathing on the window? Were you asleep or awake? Awake. I think. Bad dreams are a side effect of the immunosuppressants you're taking. I've even had some patients hallucinate. It's perfectly normal. Shall we begin? You're not coming? Mom? We have to stay here, honey? We won't move from this spot. Promise. Eli. Why don't you make a wish? What'd you wish for? That I was brave. You already are. Just this way. Hmm. Stand there. Stand there. Hands in the air. Seis, sesenta y seis. Arms out. Turn around. Wait. Vírese, Eli. Face this way. Why are you taking my picture? Listo. Where are you from? Do you know what happened to the boy who asked too many questions? He got answers? Stations. So when did this all start, Eli? About four years ago. But it's much worse now. My patients are all just like you. All with failing immune systems. The condition remains dormant until around your age. What do you think is making you sick? Needle. Lots of things. The air, water. - Dust. - Could be those things. Could be something else. Because what is an autoimmune syndrome at its core? It's the body fighting itself, right? In a normal, healthy body, antibodies are produced by stem cells in the marrow. But in your body, that gene is impaired, so I'm gonna take this modified virus and inject it into the marrow. This virus is gonna repair that gene and reset your entire immune system. Poof. Like a magic trick. Right? Scalpel. Bone punch. So, I want you to count back from 100. One hundred... Ninety-nine... Ninety-eight... Keep counting. Ninety-seven... Ninety-six... Ninety-five... Ninety-four... Ninety-three... Ninety-two... What-What... Dr. Horn? Dr. Horn, let me go. I can't do that, Eli. Dr. Horn, it burns. - That's the medication. - No! No, it really burns. That means it's working. No! Aah! Boo! Ha ha ha. Ah. I shouldn't have done that. - What, with you being sick and all. - How do you know I'm sick? Well, you're in there, aren't you? That's where all of you stay. They say you're what, like, allergic to the world, right? I-I guess you could say that. So you've never been outside? No, I have. I mean, I wasn't born like this. My mom-My mom told me I was a tough birth. She was sick a lot when I was pregnant. Er, um, when she was pregnant, but... - I was fine until recently... - You tell everybody your life story? Uh... You're cute. I'm Haley. I live down the road. - I'm Eli. - You're what? Eli. My name's Eli. No, I don't like it. I want to call you something else. What are you into? What do you like to do? Um, I like magic... card tricks. Card tricks? Wow. No. No, look. Hold on a sec. Uh... Look. Pick a card, any card. Wait. So I pick a card and then- and then what, you're gonna, like, guess what card I picked? - Uh... - Hey, you want to see a real trick? I can light this twig on fire with my mind. Don't believe me? Watch. You scared of fire? Uh... no. I used to be scared of fire, then I learned how to master it. Where's the match? What match? Come on. It's what you were doing when you turned around. You hid it in your palm and then distracted me. A good magician never reveals her secrets. Come on, tell me. What's the fun in that? Some things you just got to figure out on your own. Anyway, I got to go. Wait. I could ask my parents if you could come inside. In there? No, thanks. Why not? Look, I don't mean to freak you out, but... there's just something... off about the whole place. Gives me the creeps. Actually, I'm not even supposed to be here. The woman that runs this place, she doesn't like me. I don't like her either. She's... shifty. Shifty? It's just better if you don't say anything. See you later, Houdini. What are you doing? You can't wander this place by yourself. Put this back in your hand. Where did she go? Who? Dear Lord... we are thankful for everything that you have given us... and for this time that we get to spend together as a family. And especially for placing Dr. Horn in our paths. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Something on your mind, honey? He's upset because I yelled at him. I said I was sorry, but he needs to put that drip back in his hand. He won't believe me that I saw someone in the hallway. - There's another kid in this house. - Probably one of the nurses. It wasn't a nurse! Eli. Honey. Calm down, okay? Calm down. It was another patient. Honey, I'm scared, too. I am. I get scared of new places, new people sometimes, but for you, it must be so overwhelming. On your body and your mind. But there is nobody else here except us. I promise. Here. I got it. Right. Eat up. - Looks like shit. - Tastes like shit, too. I knew it. "For best results, practice in a dark place." Who are you? Aah! No! No, no! No! No! Eli, Eli! Listen to me! - Shh. - No! It's Dad. Shh. Shh. Shh. - Honey. - Hey, listen to me. Shh. Shh. Shh. - Hey. - Paul, do something! - Do what? - No! No! No! Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just... It's, uh, it's the medication. Maybe you could lower the dosage or something. I mean, if he's seeing things, I mean... - We put everything on the line for this. - I know. Everything. - He was terrified, Paul. - Okay, let her do her job. I-I'm-I'm not gonna sugarcoat this. What we're doing here is very hard on Eli's body, and some of the symptoms from his condition are bound to flare up, but we need to stay the course of the medication, especially with Procedure Two. Why? What do you mean? Eli's gonna get worse before he gets better. Hey. Be strong, sweetheart. We're right here. Good news, Eli. We spent the night working on your stem cells, and we can confirm that the gene therapy virus is correcting the mutation. This is gonna burn a little bit. On the count of three. One, two... It'll be over before you know it. - Remain calm. - It burns. It hurts! Aah! Aah, it burns! Breathe. This is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, the virus that's gonna cure your affliction is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, so we have to penetrate. Drill. Relax. Stress will make your symptoms worse. You're gonna be fine. You will be. Jesus, look over my son... give him the strength to get through this. You really think praying's gonna help us? - How is he? - He had a bit of a reaction today. A reaction? Yes. It's quite common. His body's gonna reject the new cells just like any transplant. Okay? Can I see him? After he's had some rest. Thank you. Dr. Horn told me how strong you were... - There's something shifty about her. - Shifty? What? - I think she's making me sicker. - No, she's not, Eli. It's the medication... I know what I saw, Mom, and it's not the medication. And if it was, then why do I feel worse? Because it's working. The good cells are fighting the bad stuff. You're bound to feel weak. I wanna leave. You want to leave? Okay. Let's go. Come on. Doctor says you're getting better. You want to leave and stay sick forever, or do you want to stay and get better? What's it gonna be? Stay and get better. Who's there? That's not real. - Eli. - That's not real. It's not real. Let me out! Please! No! No. Please stop! Mom! Mom, Dad, help! What did you do? It wasn't me! Eli, you were standing in front of the closet door. - 'Cause I'd been hiding in there. - With shards of glass? They wrote it on my window, too. - Your name? - No. "Lie." You could've hurt yourself, honey. Eli, none of my other patients have ever mentioned ghosts. - Hey. - No. No one believes me! Oh, now you decide to show up. What happened last night? Did I get you in trouble? You look terrible. I feel terrible, too. What happened? If I tell you, you have to promise not to laugh. Just spill it. I think this house is haunted. I think something bad happened here. Great. Now you think I'm crazy, too. No, I don't think you're crazy. Then why'd you laugh? Because Perry, the kid who stayed here before you, he said the same thing. - He did? - Yep. Well, I don't talk to him as much as I talk to you, but he said that he was seeing ghosts. Dr. Horn said none of her patients ever saw ghosts. And you believe her? Mom and Dad said to trust her. Oh, and I'm sure your parents always tell you the truth. Perry said the longer he was in there, the more clearly he saw them, and he told Dr. Horn that. - Well, what did she say? - I don't know. He said he was about to get Procedure Three. And that was the last time I saw him. - I need to get out of here. - So get your hazmat and go. I can't. I wouldn't survive outside without my parents. Wait here a sec. Aah. No! No! Let go of me! No! No! Let me go! No! Let go of me! No. No. No! Let me out! Let me out! No. No. No! No. No, stop! No! Eli, breathe. Eli, breathe. Breathe. - Breathe. - Eli? Eli? What's going on? I-I heard screams. He was trying to leave the house. They opened the door. Haldol, 20 ccs! I thought you said this place was secure. Must have been an electrical short circuit. You know about the ghosts. Eli, you have to stop it. Hurry, hurry! I know about Perry! Who-Who's Perry? - I-I don't know what you're talking about. - Lie. Who's Perry? Lie! You're a liar! Someone tell me what's actually going on. Eli, I'm right here. Look at me. I'm right here. Okay? Breathe. Breathe. Let's make our wish. I don't want to make a fucking wish! Mom? He's... He's just not... he's not accepting treatment. He's just not accepting it. No, he's not. I think we have to prepare for the decision. We're just going to do it. He's not accepting treatment. So there's no other choice at this point. Yeah. I was just saying that I can't believe that he actually tried to leave. The last treatment didn't go as I'd hoped. Eli's brain is waging a war against the serum. That's why he's feeling so sick and delusional. I'm going to administer diazepam to enable him to rest until dawn, and then we'll begin the final procedure. Wait. I think I should be the one that gives it to him. He'll take it better coming from me. I'm not crazy, Mom. I know you're not. Dad thinks I am. No, he doesn't. - He doesn't. - Yes, he does. He looks at me like he doesn't believe me. You mean the same way you're looking at me right now? You know, this is hard for him. Watching you go through this. He was the one that found Dr. Horn. He looked everywhere for a doctor to help you. We would never have brought you here if we didn't think you could go on and live a normal life. But you said you believed me. I do. I believe that you saw things. I just... I just don't believe the things you saw are real. Hey. Trust me. I know the effects medication can have on the mind. You see something, and you swear it was real. But it's not. I know how hard this is for you. But it's almost over. You just need to get some sleep. - What's that? - What? What? I'm not as good at tricks as some people. Here. - What is it? - It's just something to help you sleep. Show me. Good. Come here. You know I love you, right? I know. Three-one-seven... What? Okay, lie down. Sweet dreams. Haley. Bitch. Unh. Still alive, huh? Listen. Did Perry ever say if the ghost was trying to hurt him or help him? He didn't say. Why? Because they tried to drag me out of the house, and I'm not sure if they wanted to kill me or get me to leave. It kind of sounds like they wanted to kill you. Why would you think otherwise? "Lie"? They wrote that. On my window and on my closet door. But if you turn it upside down... Three-one-seven. What does that mean? This is what they've been trying to tell me the entire time. Ooh. Oh, like a secret code to a secret door. I never said it was a door. Don't give me that suspicious look. It was just the first thing that entered my head. You're not a ghost, too, are you? What kind of drugs do they got you on now? Do I look like a ghost? I think it is a code to a door... to the medical wing. - What's in there? - Answers. - To what? - To why she's lying. Are you gonna do it? What if you get caught? Everybody's gotta sleep. Right? Lie. What were you and Dr. Horn talking about? What? What were you and Dr. Horn talking about? Before I came along. Tell me. Just talking about the need to be prepared... for all possibilities. All possibilities? What do you mean? Look, she said that with each procedure, there are... inherent risks. He had a bad reaction to the last one. And for every chance that he's gonna pull through, there's... - What? - There's a chance that he won't. She said that? It's what she said. That she doesn't think it's gonna work? Then I don't understand. She's cured every one of her patients. That's what you told me. That's what I told Eli. Why would you lie to me? Why would you lie to me about that? Just tried to do what's best for Eli. You knew this was always a possibility, Rose. Is his life in danger? Is it? How dare you? How dare I? - I'm leaving. - How dare I?! - I'm taking him with me. - After what you did? You're the one that wanted to try anything! And you're in denial. We had one chance to do the right thing. Rose. Rose! Eli. "Perry. Treatment 1." "Treatment 2." Treatment 3. "Agnes. Treatment 1." Treatment 2. Treatment 3. "Lucius. Treatment 1." "Treatment 2." "Treatment 3." Mom! Dad, we have to leave! Take a breath, Rose. Open the door. Open this door! I am leaving, and I'm taking him with me. - Where would you go? - Anywhere. As far away as possible. And keep him hidden in a glass cage away from the world? - What kind of life is that? - A life where he is loved. No amount of love can protect him from his condition. You know that. You've seen with your own eyes how bad it can get. It will only get worse, and by then, it's gonna be too late. Out there, there's nothing but suffering. There's only suffering for him in here. - In here, there's still a chance. - Is there? I need to know that you can save him. With you by my side, I can, Rose. Mom! Must have gotten in last night. Dad. Dad, where's Mom? We all need to leave right now. - She'll be back in a minute. - No. No, we have to leave right now. Dad, it's her. It's Dr. Horn. I saw her files. None of her patients made it past the third procedure. Dad, they all died. You remember the old meadow? The one we took Bronson to when he was just a pup. Last night, I had a dream that we were playing ball in the old meadow... and Bronson was chasing the ball. He was attacking it. Remember how he used to do that? Dad. You're scaring me. No, no, no. Come here. You are so loved, Eli. You know that. Sometimes I get jealous of you, the way Mom... says, "You know I love you, right?" And you say... I know. Like it's nothing to you. That makes me happy, the way you say it like that, like it's nothing. Love is normal. There's just no doubt in your mind. Eli. I'm so... sorry... for all this. Come here. Ow! Aah! Why did you do that? Take him to the exam room. Let go! She's brainwashed you! Mom! Dad! You have to believe me! I saw the files! Aah! - Let go! - This is for your own good. No! No, she's gonna kill me! Like she killed the others! - Let go! - Why isn't the sedation working? Mom! Mom, please, you have to believe me! She killed all her... Oh... Ow! Eli! Eli! Stop! - Eli. - She moved them! - She knows I know. - Settle down. You killed your patients, didn't you? You experimented on them, and then you murdered them! But they're still here! They're still here in this house! - Eli, breathe. - Get back! - You are sicker than you realize. - You get away from me! Get back, all of you! I thought they were trying to hurt me, but they never hurt anyone. - It was you the whole time. - Eli, take a breath. Eli, we're all just trying to help you. Open the door. - Eli. - Eli! Okay, we'll get in another way. Come with me. Mom, Dad, I was right. This place is not... What are you doing? What are you doing? Let me out! - Let me out. I can't breathe! - You can't leave him in there. I can't breathe! - We have to. - No! He knows. Eli. I can breathe. I can breathe. I can breathe. Mom! Mom, Dad, I'm not sick! I can breathe! Why did you tell me I was sick? Why did you tell me I was gonna die? Let me out! Let me out! - Please, Mom, let me out! - Rose. Let me out! Rose. I know he's awake, but we're almost ready. - I need to see him. - I wish you wouldn't. If we just proceed... I'm not asking. Eli. Eli, can you hear me? I'm sorry I lied to you. You were never allergic to the outside, but I had to make you believe you were to protect you. Protect you from the world. I know this must be so confusing... and scary... but no one's trying to hurt you, honey. And none of this is your fault. It's mine. But, baby, you've got to see this last procedure through, and then I promise you, I will explain everything. Eli. Eli. Eli. Aah! - That was Eli. - Eli! Eli! No! Eli! Aah! Eli! Open this door! Open the door! - What's happening? - They lied to me! I'm not sick! They're gonna kill me! Open this door! You don't understand what's happening here! - I can't do it! - Yes, you can. You're so much stronger than the others. Eli! Open this door! Don't be afraid. No! Don't be afraid, Eli. - No! - Don't be afraid. - You. - They're the ones who are afraid! No! No! No! Oh! No! Let go! - No! - Get his shirt off. - No! - Get his shirt off. No! Unh. Dad! Why are you doing this? No! No! No! No! What are you doing? Rose. What are you doing? He was right. She wants to kill him. I saw the bodies of the children. She buried them down there. She didn't save any of them. Why did you tell me you could save him? Because I can. I thought I could cure Eli. God knows I wanted to. The gene therapy would've worked if he weren't so strong. He's too far gone, but he could still be saved. - Mom, what is she talking about? Mom! - Get back! Get back! Don't you touch my son. We've got to get him out of here. He cannot leave here. You know that. Not the way he is. I'll get you out of here, honey. We're gonna leave. Honey, get this... - Get off of me! - Rose. Rose. Let me help you. You're gonna help me get him out of here. I'll help you. - Promise? - Yes. Untie him, please. Save him. Paul. - Paul, what are you doing? - No! - I can save his soul. - No. What are you doing? - She's gonna kill him! - No! - No! - No! Get off of me! No, get off me! - No! - Dad! - Rose! - Dad! What are you doing? Dad! Dad, why are you doing this? No! No! Eli... you were brought here with love and hope. No! Your parents have been working with me for longer than you realized. No. No! The sickness you have... I'm not sick. I could breathe. I could breathe. The sickness you have doesn't come from outside. It comes from within. What did I do? - What did I do? - You didn't do anything wrong. But you will. Mom! Mom, what's happening? In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Saint Michael the Archangel, illustrious leader of the heavenly army, defend us in the battle against the rulers of the world of darkness, and in the spirit of wickedness in high places, - heed my prayer. - Let our prayers be heard by thee. God arises, his enemies scattered, and those who hate him flee before him. "Accursed diabolical legion, we abjure you by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, who so loved the world that he gave us his only begotten son so that those who believe in him may not perish but have everlasting life. Begone, serpent, master of lies! In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, deliver us! No! Aah! Aah! May this holy water purify the skin. May this dagger... purify the soul. May you find peace and forgiveness in the arms of the Lord, Eli. Eli! Aah! Aah. No! Dr. Horn! - Dr. Horn! - Dios mío! Dr. Horn. Dr. Horn! Come on, get up! We gotta get out of here! Open the door! Oh, my God! Watch. Eli. What has she been putting inside me? Let them go. What have you been putting inside me? Medicine... to make you feel better. Lie! Holy water. It's holy water. The injections were tannis roots. Suppression medication while she worked on your genes. What am I? What am I?! You're our son. Lie! You're my son! And my father? I prayed, Eli. I prayed every day. Prayed to who? Prayed to who?! Prayed... to... who? The Lord didn't answer me. But your father did. He promised me you wouldn't be like him, Eli. But he lied. The Devil always lies. Eli. I wanted you so desperately. Forgive me. Eli. Hey, Houdini. I knew you were stronger than the others. The others? Perry? And Lucius and Agnes, your sadly departed half-brother and sister. Dad gets around. If you knew the whole time, you could've just told me. Would you have believed me if I had? Sometimes you just have to walk the path for yourself. Besides, we're not allowed to set each other free. Why not? Um, Dad says you got to earn your place. My dad. I can take you to him if you want. You still trust her? It's cold outside. Hey, you. Yeah, you're driving. Let's go. We got a long road ahead. I'm driving? Oh, God. Mom, breathe. Breathe. Take a deep breath in. Blow out all your candles. Make a wish. - Let's go. - Okay.
