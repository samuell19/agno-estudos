Luca, coming to play? Come here. Luca! Where are you going? To help them. How? You're too small! You have to grow big and strong. Let's go, kids! Get your things. Let's go say goodbye to daddy. Luca! Luca! Where's Luca? He got dressed and went out. Every time I leave, he runs off and hides. See you in a couple of weeks, kids. Daddy... Luca! Luca! What will the doctor do tomorrow? He just has to check Luca's teeth. Goodnight. Mommy, why don't you kiss Luca goodnight too? Because he was naughty today. You know you behaved badly today, don't you? Yes. Baba... Baba, do you hear that? Mommy... I can't sleep. Me neither. Come here. Come here. Thank you, Flores. Come forward. Closer. Very good for an external candidate. Why have you never studied here? I lived abroad for a long time with my family. I see you've always achieved excellent grades. Could you play us something else? For example... You could sight-read this piece. It's fucking freezing! I'll never get used to this weather. You will, you'll see. Here he is. You can tell by the way he gets off his bike that he doesn't understand jazz. What? Let me do the talking. He's a spoilt brat! What've we got to lose? It's a waste of time. Hi. I'm Raffaele. Alessandro. We heard you play in the exam... You're great. Anyway, we... We're into jazz and we wondered if you'd be interested in playing with us. I don't know, I've never played jazz. Well, maybe we should go... Wait. It's a shame, he's got a nice touch. Okay, but... what can we do with a touch? Play some Bach? Church music? Wait a second, let's see... Sorry. Just a try out... Let's see what effect real jazz has on him. Bud Powell. Okay, let us know what you think. You're fantastic. A real genius! Pablo? I... A bit chaotic, isn't it? What do you think, dad? I wouldn't like... you to stray too far from classical music. I can always continue with that. But I like jazz. Luca, is this African stuff really necessary? The bow, arrows... Yes... Go on! Easy does it. Is it through? bit more that way. There. Let's just put it down. Oh boy! This can go over there. Let's take a break. Got any cigarettes? No... Sorry! My fault. I'll start. Great! Enjoy your meal. Hello? Hello, good morning. Yes, of course... we can do about ten numbers. When? Okay, thanks. Bye. Bye, thanks. Well? It's good. Who was on the phone? Those guys from "La Rosa". The heard the cassette and liked it. Meaning... You're free on the 1 5th, right? We're playing live! Cool! There's a big crowd, guys! The place is jam-packed. They'll slaughter us. I could use a big spliff. I wish! You're on. Move it! Heard how he plays? Unfortunately he's too handsome, but you can't have everything. What an idiot! Hey, we asked you for a vodka, is your head in the clouds? Sorry. Well done! You were really great. My God! You've got a way of playing... Let's toast the trio. Go for it! You have to drink too. No, I just came to bring you this. What is it? I know, I know what it is. Yes! Real money. Our first wage packet! Is it all there? Yes, it's all here. We went down well. We're not deadbeats! It's here! There's a review! A review in the national press! "Sensational performance by the lnvitation Trio!" Luca! "Promising debut at La Rosa". "A mature, outstanding trio!" Cinzia, give me a hand. I'm really in the shit. Did you hear? Tonight, Marta. Tonight or never. I get it. Bye. Bye, thanks. Well... Fucking hell! Shit! It won't start! It won't start. Want me to try? No, leave it. It's dead. If you want, I'll walk you to the bus stop. There are no buses at this hour. Let's look for a taxi. Isn't that a motorbike? That? Yes, it's mine. Hasn't it occurred to you to give me a ride? Let's go home. Huh? Let's go home. You're gorgeous! Sorry. You made me jump. Carry on. This is for you... I just churned it out. Wait for me! Say it. Say it! I love you? Not with a question mark, say it properly. I love you... What? I love you. What did your mom die of? A tumour. Let's go up there. What makes me mad is... I hardly remember anything about her. Just a recurring situation. We were in Africa, on this endless beach. It was beautiful: the sea, the clear water. I was playing ball with Baba and she watched us for hours. She nearly always wore a scarf on her head and '50s-style sunglasses with the turned-up corners. What's wrong? Nothing. What's up? Well? You're playing by yourselves, l... Meaning? Usually, I'm really fond of you, but when I hear you play like this, I hate you both. What's the problem? We playing jazz, it's loose. Loose is one thing, playing in isolation is another. Okay, let's say it ends here. Me and Raffaele already figured it out! What? Now that everyone's after you, you're about to dump us. I'm not dumping you at all, I'm just saying that each of us is playing in isolation. Why didn't you tell us you're playing with Massimo Urbani? He just called me, I didn't want to put your noses out of joint. I was wrong, I should've told you, but it's not like... Fuck you! Lello? Forget it, Luca. Play by yourself. Take a break. Do you have to practice so much? Scales everyday for hours on end? Yes, I have to study. Because... We've been here an hour and you haven't said a word to us. Excuse me. I get sucked in by scales. I forget everything. Sorry, I just forget. Is there something wrong? No. This kid doesn't smoke or drink. No drugs, not even the odd joint. I don't know how the hell he plays so well! Luca Flores! Luca. Where've you been? Padua. How are you? This packaging's very odd because... ..the Panama is usually... Hi, dad. Here I am. Well! How old are you? 2,000? Yes. But I actually feel a bit younger today. Hello, Luca. Hi. My present. An atlas. Wonderful! It's an old school edition. Marvellous. It's even got the Belgian Congo. It's great, thanks! I thought it'd take you back to when even you didn't dream about travelling as much as you actually did. Yes, it's lovely. Thanks! I also thought that it's not your fault if we're no longer a family. What? Will you pass me the wine, please? Here, dad. I just said it's not dad's fault if we're no longer a family. If we only see each other... at holiday time... at Christmas, birthdays and that's all. It's the fault of atlases, of a world that's too big. What are you talking about? Don't talk like that, you seem crazy. Okay, come on... What did you say? I really seem crazy? Forgive me. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Why can't we go with Pablo and Heidi? They're going to a school for older children. In London. You're coming with me to your aunt's in ltaly and then to Portugal. I'd like to play the piano. You only just got back. Plus, it's Sunday. I dropped in to see dad and we... had a little argument. All the more reason... for us to be together, right? I have to tell you something. They called me about a tour. In Europe. Quite long. Starting in Rome. Great. Who with? Chet Baker. Who? Chet Baker. Chet Baker... Are you happy? Do you realise? No, you don't. Luca, what's up? I'm scared of going crazy. Stuff keeps happening to me... weird stuff. I leave my body. I have to try... to control it. I have to control it with wires. I'm terrified it'll happen to me in front of an audience. Maybe you should see a doctor. No straight-jackets, Baba. Of course not! Promise me. Promise. Come on, let's go. Baba... Promise. You're hurting me. Promise! You're hurting me. Promise? All right. I felt something had changed when I started playing... Are you staying or leaving right away? We're in Leghorn tonight, then Genoa for 3 weeks. I just read your horoscope. I don't usually believe it, but... .. it's dead accurate this time. What does it say? You'll have some great news. Like what? In a few months, you and I won't be alone anymore. I'm pregnant. We're going to have a baby. Are you sure I'm the father? Or is it that guy who was making you laugh last night? You're cruel... Really cruel. Listen, this is what we'll do... this is what we'll do. This is what we'll do. We'll get married. We'll get married, raise a family. We'll raise a family. Let's have a kid. Let's do it. That's what we'll do, okay? Okay? Luca, I had a child. I was carrying it inside me. But I don't want kids with you. Why? Because... Because I want to go back to being a normal person. want to go back to having a normal life. Do you understand that word? Normal. What happened to Chet Baker? What? TRAGlC DEATH OF JAzz MAN CHET BAKER Yes? Luca! Come in! Staying for dinner? Why are you standing in the dark? Switch it off! What happened? I killed Chet Baker. He's dead. I killed him with the scales. What? It was me. My scales drove him to it. Chet's dead. He jumped from a window I push him with my E minor scale. With that damn... Damn scale in E minor. Damn it! Damn scale in E minor! Luca... Damn scale. Oh God, Luca... Who'll tell dad? Huh, Baba? Who'll tell dad now? Who'll tell him? Who'll tell dad? Who'll tell dad? Be careful. Calm down. Please, come here. Please, please. Want some water? Stay with me a while. Luca, open up! Luca, open up! Open up! What are you doing? Open up! Luca, please! Cinzia, it's Barbara. Luca's at my place. He's in bad shape. Hurry, please! Luca, open up. It's me, Cinzia! Open up, please. Please, Luca. Did Baba tell you about Chet? You didn't do anything to anyone. I killed everyone. I killed our mother. Luca, why are you saying that? Why are you saying that? Can't you hear how Baba's crying? Does it seem possible to you? Come out, come on! Please, Luca. Baba... The doctor recommended not to talk to him. He'll be asleep in less than a minute. Thanks. Listen... who gave you permission to bring him here? Release my brother immediately! He's sick, he needs help. I don't care, let him out! Heidi... You brought him here, didn't you? You've already done enough to him. Since you left him, my brother's fallen apart. That's not the case. Luca's sick. He's sick, dad. I talked to a psychiatrist. He'll examine him tomorrow. If Luca wants, he can talk about how he feels. If not, he can go home. Barbara, I'm leaving. No, Cinzia, please. What'll I tell him if he wakes up and you're not here? When he wants me, he can always find me. He's woken up, he's quite stable now. Can we see him? Only one person. You decide who. Dad... No... I'll go. Where were you? In Milan. See what chaos I caused? Don't think about it. Where are the home movies? What? Home movies. Where are the home movies? The ones dad shot in Africa with mom. Remember? Of course I do. I used to help him make the title cards with cardboard and coloured pens. Two title cards, the first: "Corallo Films present". The second: "The end". Everyone tells me you're a very talented musician. I don't understand music, but... I don't know, I see you as a soloist. We're a family of soloists. I wonder if that's a good thing... What's wrong? Don't worry, dad. Don't worry. Hey, look what I found for you. The record with the world on it. Is it for me? Of course. I used to play this with one finger. With mom. How can I help you, Luca? Nothing, dad. I'm fine. I'm fine. I just need to get out of Florence for a bit. Goodbye, doctor. See you tomorrow. Cinzia! "Dear Cinzia, I'm in Africa. Look at the arrow, I'm there and I'm composing again! Luca." Mommy! Mommy! Hello? Luca! I have to kill you. Luca, what are you saying? Thank you. He'll be with me for a few days. Goodnight. Mommy! Daddy! Thanks for calling me. Where is he now? At dad's, under sedation. The doctors decided to put him to sleep for a whole week. Luca can come stay with me whenever he wants, you know. Cinzia, I don't know why... But maybe it's best if he doesn't see you. Why? It's what the doctors say. They say there's a complicated bond with you, I don't know Excuse me, Baba... but maybe he has a complicated bond with all of you. Listen... .. if I really can't do anything, at least let me see him. I can't. Baba, one last time! Please. Let's go. When you were a kid they should've thrashed you more often! I've got a cunning illness. But it's an illness, right? It'll go just like it came, you'll see. You've got to start playing again. I don't know... I do! Didn't you say you had some new stuff? Stuff you'd written? The numbers you wrote in Africa. Are these the ones? Yes. How long before that damn hand's back in shape? At least three months. Okay... in three months and a day you'll play for an audience! Guys, we're on. Everything's ready. Luca, we'll start when you want. When you want. Why the long face? Show them how you dominate that fucking piano! Go, Luca! How are you? Better, they gave me shock therapy. Want to hug me? Sorry... I love you, Luca. I'm off. Bye. I liked the idea of playing in a plastic kid's playhouse. Like the one's you see in playgrounds. But with the audience outside. They can listen, but from outside. It's a nice idea. Sometimes I'd like to live like that too. Thanks for bringing me. You're thanking me? Drop me here, I'll walk the rest of the way. Bye. Bye, sis. Will you record this too, please? Okay.
