It all began with a sleigh ride along the Caribbean. It was just like Dominic, hooking me in with the sea sled and now he was hauling me along in his latest brain wave. A treasure hunt. Not that I was worrying much about treasure right then. I was just along for the ride. I must have saltwater blood, the way I go for these sunken jungles. But dom was setting the course for something he had seen. The rotting timbers of an old ship which just had to be some ancient Spanish scow sunk with a million in gold. I knew better... Down here, every island has its sunken ruin. But you sure eat up the oxygen tryin' to chase it down. Sand, for instance. It drifts and shifts with every tide and what you think you saw turns out to be a ghost. Then I almost fell off the sled. I'd found dom's ship. Or what was left of it. The sleigh ride was over. I peeled off and back-tracked to what I'd seen. The floors of these waters are paved with wrecks. But all wrecks aren't paved with gold. Not one out of a hundred turns out to be worth salvaging. Any operation has to start with collecting evidence. Without it, you might just waste a lot of time and equipment pawing through some old pineapple scow or an empty hull that's already been tapped. Photographs are a big help, too, when you wanna tag a wreck. Not that I'd expected much from this heap of barnacles. But some of this junk might lead to finding out her name and the date she sailed, and from that we might find out what she was carrying. I was having my kicks just browsing. But dom was acting like he had fallen into a mint. One thing for sure, that shooting iron was no .45 automatic. I was trying hard to keep my head and not start climbing up to cloud nine like old dom. But it wasn't easy. Excitement is like getting drunk. It hits you before you know it. And I was being hit. - I was right, huh, Johnny? - You were right. I tell you, there's a fortune down there. Gold bullion waiting for us to scoop it up. Do I have to convince you on that, too? Go on, as well you did, I'd love to hear it. - Bullion, huh? - We are rich. When we bring it up. We'll bring it up. What's the matter? Don't you speak Spanish? You were down there a long time. I watched the bubbles and I fell asleep. My name's herrera, rico herrera. I'm Dominic. Dominic quesada. This is my friend. Johnny Grant. Miguel vega... deaf. I never seen you in these waters before. Where do you come from? Havana. We work for the science institute. Ah, so. And you? Where do you come from? Puerto borrego, down the coast. What do you do down there that takes so long? We look for rocks. A scientific study. It's a long way from Havana just for rocks. Good shot, yes? An inch either way, and one of you lies dead. Does he know? We were sure talking loud enough when we came up. Maybe he was asleep like he said. Maybe the other one is deaf. Shark hunters, huh? Uh-huh, a tough way to make a living. With rifles? Oh, sure. They sell the shark's liver. I know. I have done it myself. A tough way to make a living. Back in Cuba, they told us at the university that those hunks of evidence were real. We knew they were the McCoy. But we knew something else. We needed 5,000 bucks for a good-sized boat, supplies and oxygen enough to stay down day after day. And all the capital dom had was the gold in his teeth. My problem was a lot bigger than capital. I had to worry about telling Theresa. That would be the toughest part of all. How to tell Theresa? Leave it on the dock, please. I don't wanna be left on the dock. Johnny! Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Well, look at me. I'm a mess. You're beautiful. Five whole days. Dominic! I ought to cut your ears off for staying away from us so long. Much too long, chiquita Linda. Mi diablo alegre... Come in here where I can see you. You're all right, ah? Good. - No troubles in your face? - No trouble. There is something though. You are in love. Some pretty chiquita finally got to bachelor Dominic, huh? I swear there's no one. Come on below, dom, we'll buy you a drink. That's funny. I've never made this mistake before. I'm in the home of Theresa and Johnny. Of course you see love in my face. Never mind. It'll come to me. Come on! Oh, Johnny and I were home on a vacation about three months ago. We saw your mama. She told me and she sends her love to you. She said you were in Brazil doing something big in rover. I was, until it snapped in my face. Oh, you couldn't have brought me a nicer present. Ah, Johnny is tough but you just have to bear it. Dominic, it's not maybe for anyone. The midwife handed her to me. I held her by the ankles and I slapped her. She let out her yell like a little coyote. Still does. Hey, where did you two run into each other? Agua paicol? I never got to agua paicol. No? Johnny, you didn't get us a place for the tourists to camp? Tourists? Honey, make us a drink, will you? Well, all right, but... But Johnny, we could have made a lot of money this season if we'd have a nice camping out place for the tourists. Maybe eight or nine hundred dollars. - She calls that money. - Pitiful, isn't she? Yeah, but she's a good kid. I never got to agua paicol. Uh, he went with me for a little boat ride. That's what it was. That's what I saw in your face. What did you see? In love with some little chiquita... How stupid can I be? You're in love, alright. You two are up to some crazy plan again. Oh, Theresa, believe me. This time... This time what is it going to be? This time, we're gonna make you rich. We are still paying the bank back from the last time he made us rich. This time it's a sunken ship... Full of gold. I won't listen. We can't afford it. Look, it's not only dom who says there's a treasure down there and me, but also a man who studied these things. A priest. A jesuit. He should be ashamed of himself. He's even coming with us. When we gave him an idea of what was down there, he nearly went out of his mind. And what was down there? This. A million dollars. 1640. And all the ships that sailed before 1640 that didn't carry gold were ashamed to leave the harbor. This is the navigational instrument that steered that ship right into the rocks to wait for us. Theresa, baby, I've seen it with my own eyes. Johnny, I think you've seen it with his eyes. I invested my last peso. Now would he have done that if this was just a bubble? Sure, he's done it before and so have you. What about the time you were going to corner the market on avocados? So what do we do? Do? Well, I'll tell you. I took a look at that wreck down there and I said to myself, "Johnny, you are the head of the family. "I'll go back to Havana and hock the equity "that Theresa and I have in the boat. "Invest in the expedition with dom and bring back all that loot." Ole! Olé. All that was down there. Back here, I take a look at my wife... My boat, think of my responsibilities. And I say, "Johnny, you're doing just fine as it is." Dom, we can't go. I understand. I just wanted to give you and Theresa a chance to get rich. That's all. We can't afford it. I know you're counting on using this boat. Ah, the harbor is full of boats. I mean to raise the money. Money, that's the least of my worries. I attract it like a magnet. Hey, Johnny, you buy dinner for me tonight at the three seagulls by the waterfront, huh? Well, goodbye, chiquita bonita. I'll see you later. - Dominic? - Huh? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, I forgot. Here, Johnny. You help me. Ah, don't worry, Johnny. We had fun for a few days. We dived together for the first time since we were in the frogs. Now forget it. We never went. There is no wreck. There is no treasure. There is no gold. There is nothing. Wipe everything away from your mind, huh? I'll see you later. You sorry, Johnny? No. Nobody said this rainbow was for real. I know but you really want to go, don't you? I don't know. Forget it. Don't you think we ought to talk about it? Sure. You know, I think I'll make you a nice Collins. I'll put three times as much gin in it. Okay? Fine. And just because I love you, I'm gonna spike it with a Mickey. Like that too, huh? Swell. It's gonna make you sick as a dog, you know. That's okay, huh? Great. All right, here it is. What did you do that for? I ought to throw you overboard! Well, then go ahead. Now we'll have a big fight and we'll separate. And divorce and never see each other again. Oh, what are you talking about? I'd honestly like to know. You want to go, don't you? You got no idea. Well, then why do you pretend you don't? Well, I want to stay here, too. Split right down the middle. Pobrecito. Johnny, how long did we go together before we were married? Two weeks. Two and a half. We've only been married a year. It's not a very long time. You see, Johnny... In some ways we're still strangers. And if you don't let me know you, I can't be any more interested in you than any other stranger. Wait... You remember when you gave me this? Sure. You said that down there, the natives wear them all the time. That's right. They were afraid if they show their real faces, they might get hurt. And they only take them off... When they're alone... Or with someone they love and trust, huh? And that's how it has to be with us. Yes, Johnny. That's why we have to talk. All right. We'll talk about it. Hello, miss Warner? Miss Warner. Hello? How dare you snoop around this boat? Get out! Get out! I told you I didn't have any money. Get out! Get out! - How dare you? - Ow! Take it easy. Don't you remember me? It's Dominic. Dominic quesada, remember? Oh, hello. Hello. Please don't be nice to me. It makes me wanna cry. Thanks. What happened to your boss, old j.P.? Oh, I don't know. He just vanished. Everybody expects me to know. I was only his secretary. Oh, oh, darlin', that's enough now. That's enough. He didn't leave any address, huh? No, he didn't. They all ask me that. The government? Yes, and half the other men in Cuba. They all ask me where Mr. Robinson is. And they get angry and yell at me and shake their fingers at me and threaten me. Oh. I really don't blame them. He owes them all money. He doesn't owe me anything. I just have a little proposition I thought he might be interested in. Uh, you have no idea where I can find him, huh? He didn't leave anything, Mr. quesada. Not even any money to pay the captain and crew. They all quit a week ago. But they yelled at me, too. Oh. They think I have access to Mr. Robinson's money. But I haven't. Honest, I haven't. I believe you. He didn't leave a penny. I've been living on peanut butter. Peanut butter, huh? Why don't you stay at the club and charge it? His credit's no good. All 1 have to my name is this yacht. What? All 1 have to my name is this yacht. What do you mean? Mr. Robinson keeps it in my name. A business precaution. Legally, I'm the owner. You have the papers? Of course. - Hola, Perez. - Hola. - He's Perez prado. - Hi. Ole! Gloria, these are my two best friends, Theresa and Johnny. - Gloria. - Hi. Sit down, chiquita bonita. Hey, Johnny. Johnny, I got a boat. She owns it. She has the papers. And she's going to join the expedition. She's going to have full share of the treasure. - It's nice. - Wow. - Right? - Right. That is, I think it's right. I mean, I hope it's right. Ah, don't worry, gringuita. You can trust me. Oh, absolutely. During his five years in the Navy, he was known as dependable Dominic. The honest sailor. Well, he never even went to a battleship. I'm impressed. Wait until you see this boat. Ay, mamacita. It's a beauty. A 50 foot, two-masted schooner. Room for six. 135 horsepower. Well, I guess he can use our money anyway, huh? Gasoline, groceries, supplies... What money? The money we got for Hawking the Theresa. The $4,800 dollars. You knew we'd get the money, didn't you, Dominic? After you left, I kept looking at the astrolabe. That's why you left the astrolabe, huh? - Oh, did I leave it? - Oh, did I leave it! Anyway, we're going. - We are? - Yes. - We're going? - Sure. Forty eight hundred dollars and a 50 foot schooner, how could we resist? Ah, Johnny. Gringuita. You, you son of a gun, I should have never left you out of my sight. - Okay, Johnny? - Sure. Why did you keep the girl a secret, huh? No secret. I never said more than hello and goodbye to her until this afternoon on the boat. Oh. Wait till you see the boat. Ay, chihuahua, she's beautiful. So is the girl. And speaking of such madness... - I know, I know. - I know. Why don't I settle down and get married? - Si. - That's all I hear from mama. I say to her, "mama, let's plant some chili peppers in the garden, huh?" And she says, "that's a very good idea, my son. "And speaking of chili peppers, when are you going to get married?" - Having fun? - I love it. Even if it turns out like one of those depressing stories where no one finds the treasure, but they all find their souls. Me, too. Hey, Johnny! Let's send a telegram to the padre, huh? Padre? Already have. Hi, stranger. You know how a kid feels getting up before dawn to go fishing? That's how dom and I felt. "Graciously hear our prayers, o lord, and "with thy holy hand, bless this boat "and all who sail thereon as thou didst deign "to bless Noah's ark in its course during the deluge. "Send thy holy angel from heaven to guard this boat "and ever keep it safe from every peril "together with all on board. "And when threat and dangers have been removed, "comfort thy servants "with a calm voyage in the desired harbor. "And, having successfully transacted their business, "recall them again when the time comes "to happiness of country and home. Thou who livest and reignest forever. Amen." The sea owed us a living, for all the time we've put in combing her reefs and scratching around those sharp coral badlands. Sometimes you dive for pennies. Sometimes for pink shells. But this time... I was a mercenary. And this time she was going to pay off. For father Cannon, this search meant something different. He received permission to leave the university to look for a lost page out of the past and us, we were chasing the future. Our future. Every man has to go after his own holy grail. I guess that Gulf wind in your face can build you up pretty high. And when evening tossed out the stars like shining dice, I could only see the high-priced bangles that hang around Theresa's throat. Ay, ay, ay, Dominic. I have heard music with more alegria. No alegria tonight, little one. You're sad tonight. Why? I have been drinking sad wine. Mi diablo alegre, huh? Hi. Those are my pajamas. What happened to your night gown? Well, I couldn't have you so... So? Johnny, tie the wheel off. What? Let the boat go. She'll take care of herself. Let the boat go. All right for you. Such gloom. Tomorrow we get to the wreck. Suppose there's nothing down there but a lot of fish and shells. It's a fine time to be thinking of that. Don't make fun. Whose making fun? What happens to dreams when hot luck turns cold and fires burn low? Chasing rainbows. Sometimes I wonder if I can go on forever chasing them. Each time it takes a little more strength. A little more energy to keep up the hope and the enthusiasm. What happened to faith? I've been cashing a lot of checks on mine, chiquita. Dominic, do me a favor, huh? Go find some happy wine? Dominic. This is a photograph of the wreck you and Johnny found? Yes it is. I took it myself. Why didn't you show it to me before? It wasn't developed. And this astrolabe, you found that in this wreck? Johnny and I found it. - That's impossible. - Why, father? For the same reason that you wouldn't use the steering gear of the queen Elizabeth on a harbor cutter. Why, a navigational device like this was never used on such a small vessel. We found it near the wreck. You salted that wreck, huh, dom? Salted? Yes, you found the wreck and then you decorated it with some of these, huh? Uh-huh, I did. - Johnny? - Yeah? You better come down here. And leave the boat go? We're not going anywhere. What did you say, honey? Your friend Dominic. He's been doing a little window dressing. What do you mean? You know, those relics of yours... Yeah? He just sprinkled them over the wreck. Oh, just this one. Where did you get it, Dominic? - It's a fake, huh, dom? - No, no, its real. I got it from a fisherman in Santa Maria. It came up in his net. He didn't know what it was. I bought it from him, Johnny. He told me where he got it. Same place where I took you. I took this thing and I threw it overboard near the wreck. - Just like that. - Uh-huh. You did, huh? You conned your old pal. I didn't make this thing. I didn't put that ship down there. Did 1? It sank. In 16407? You just put candles in the birthday cake. Sure. Take away the candle... I know, I know, it's still a cake. Don't worry, Dominic, you've got lots of faith. Yes I have. So have I. Not because of the window dressing, but I did see that wreck. And I came out here to dive down into that wreck. That's what I'm going to do. You say the fisherman found this atop of poante. Yes he did, father. In the cathedral of Panama... There once stood a statue of the virgin. Life size, that was made by the Indians. The Madonna held the Christ child in her arms. The Christ child held the terrestrial globe, surmounted by a cross. Now, in January of 1671, the good people of Panama got word that the english pirate Morgan was coming to raid their city. Well, the good fathers got the word in time to get the church treasure out of the city and over the isthmus. Though, how they ever managed with that statue, I'll never know. Why, it must have weighed several tons. Now, when they arrived at nombre de dios, they found a galleon they were able to charter. So they put all the treasure. Oh, candlesticks tall as a man, and this statue, and they put it all aboard the galleon. And they were fortunate enough to find a small pilot vessel that could lead them to Europe, and a man-o'-war to stand by as an escort. Well, when the flames of the city were still raging in the sky, the little convoy took off for Europe. But before they got out of the Caribbean there was a hurricane, and they were never heard from again. You think that our wreck, the small ship, was the pilot ship of the convoy? That I do. Because the name of the galleon that carried the treasure was "the santo bello". And look, l-l-0o. Father, the statue of the Madonna, on the galleon? Yes. Life-size, pounded out of nuggets by the Indians. Solid gold and encrusted with precious gems. Solid gold? Oh, its monetary value was several millions of dollars, but its historical value to the church... it's incalculable. You think we have stumbled on the convoy? I'll walk out on a limb and say yes. Johnny, we hit the jackpot. We'll start the search with the sled, huh, dom boy? - Good. - We could find another one. How big was it, father? - Sixteen guns. - Good, good. Okay, we'll begin in the west here and move through the area at intervals of, what, a hundred yards now? Fifty yards. - Fifty, right. - Good. Theresa wasn't letting me go under alone. Wanted or not, I had company. And so at fifty yard intervals, the search pattern for the rest of the convoy began. Day after day it was like this. Gliding through these submarine canyons like a pair of happy marlin, searching. Searching... searching... Around every coral corner. 'Til all of a sudden something was there. We were on our own now, with a few minutes breathing time left on our backs. Skin diving toward the tomb of that ship like a couple of grave robbers. Now, even Theresa knew... This time was no pipe dream. - There are guns. - Guns, huh? Ships guns. When the ropes that tied them down rotted, they elevated. Yeah. It's the man-o'-war, Johnny. The convoy was heading for the beach here. They tried to come about in that heavy sea. It sank here. =- hmm. Pilot ship, man-o-war. They're in the wrong order, though. The pilot ship would be first. No, no, no, with the hurricane raging, the first concern would be for the treasure ship. They'd have sent that in first. The treasure ship should be somewhere... around here, Johnny. Well, then, we search along the cliff, huh? Right. Well, what if it's out in 800 fathoms? Then we go home fast. Those poor fish. You'll dazzle them. Fancy, eh? Well, it's deep down there and it's dark. We have to see each other. Which one is mine, dear? Oh, cut it out. - Ah, you're back. - Yeah. We come back. You didn't get enough rocks the last time, huh? That's right. Not enough rocks. That science institute, it has a love for rocks, yes? A real passion. So they send you back with a ship big enough to hold tons of rocks, huh? That's right. - Buenos dias, buenos dias. - Morning. And a padre comes, too. And ladies. They are our assistants. What an operation. What an enthusiasm for rocks! Education is a remarkable thing. In every way. How's the hunting? Had I an education, I, too, might have an interest in such studies. How's the hunting? Oh, this area very good, but there's so little demand these days. Oh, por favor, gentlemen and ladies... Could you let me have some garbage? We have no garbage. What a shame. Ah. An inquiring mind. I suppose without it, you would not be scientists. They scatter the garbage in the water to attract the sharks. Sharks are scavengers. Si, senorita. I hope my hunting in these waters will not interfere with your collection of rocks, huh? Not if you're far enough away. I'll take care. I have a vast respect for science. Good luck. Please save the garbage for me. It will help you while you search for the rocks. Men who live by sharks get to live like them. You could almost smell the way that guy was thinking. We looked fat, and he was hungry. Who are your friends? Couple of shark hunters we met the last time we were out here. He sure asked a lot of questions. Yeah, he sure did. Just the official greeter in these parts, huh? Yeah. Come on, Johnny, let's go to work. Are they under us still? No, they're out in that direction, now. You can hardly see the bubbles. When you don't see the bubbles, that is the time to worry, little one. Tic-tac-toe. There she was. Sleeping out the centuries on that coral mountain. The sea had washed off her makeup and the worms had eaten her skin. But to us, at that moment, this hulk was a living doll. The currents had started to uncover her deck. Exposing the stump of a main mast, hatch and pieces of rail. She had torn her belly out trying to climb this reef and had become stuck in the edge of a 300-foot cliff. Our job was laid out for us. This hatchway should lead to the captain's quarters and, from there, to the strong room. It's the santo bello, beyond any doubt. - I knew it. - Me, too. As soon as I looked at it, I felt it in here. It was as though I had swallowed a balloon. And this, this long shadow, that the edge of the cliff? That's right. She's hanging halfway over that chasm. Very deep? About 200 fathoms. They almost made it. I will shed tears for them some other time. All 1 want to do right now is to go down and look for it. Mmm. It'll be a long wait until morning. Let's, uh, let's do something. The statue of the Madonna, life-sized... Solid gold. Encrusted with precious gems. Well, it's about time. What kept you? You're being grouchy, honey. Ah, it's this boat. It's shrinking. There are people all over it. Well let's dig around. Yeah, very funny. Hey, how long has that been there? - What, the island? - Yeah. As long as we've been here. And about a million years before that. Well, this is the first time I've really seen it. You've been busy, honey. That's a beautiful island. - You want to go ashore? - Yeah. All right. Oh, we don't have to, uh... We should ask. Nobody down there wants to go ashore, do they? Ashore? What for? Oh, just to look around. Hey, how about a picnic? Yeah. Johnny we'll have a picnic! - Get the radio, gringuita. - All right. I'll start the outboard. Being this near-rich can make a man scared. Scared his luck won't hold out. It can almost make him forget what he's got already. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, no, no, no! Oh, oh-oh. Mmm-mm. Ah! No more jitters, huh? What jitters? Hey, remember me. Well, maybe a little bug fever. With all that loot down there. Johnny... Let me dive with you and Dominic tomorrow. Why? 'Cause I want to see it. Ah. Little different from cornering the avocado mar... Don't be smart! I could be wrong once. Oh, no. That could never happen. No, but you would let me go with you, won't you? You know, "whither thou goest...". Okay. Mmm. Travel. Hmm? Travel. You and I. With all the money. All right. - We'll go to south America? - Uh-huh. Marrakesh, Morocco... Casablanca. It's nice there. Mm-hmm... Even during the war. Beautiful. Lots of pretty girls? Oh, I wouldn't know. Like most of us fellas in the service... I thought only of duty. Don't give me that, Johnny Grant. I was a clean-cut, high-type fellow in those days. Well, I like you better as you are now. Mmm. The salvage job takes Patience. You have to pry and pry until a wreck gets to know you. And tells you her secrets. And here was the door that didn't open. And I wasn't wasting any time looking for a key. There were slower, safer ways to pull this galleon apart, but the chips were down and every trip was stacking the cards against us. So it had to be dynamite. Those sand shrimp weren't used to entertaining visitors. Must have been thousands of them. Chattering like old ladies on the porch of a summer hotel. And where there was that many sand shrimp... There was plenty of sand. Mmm. Mmm. Woo-hoo! "The bends”, we used to call it. There's a lot of fancy medical names for what hit dom. Sometimes it's from nitrogen getting into the blood and lousing up the metabolic balance of the system. Sometimes it's just from being too old. And going too deep. That one extra time. Whatever the cause... Dom was depth drunk. And once it begins to hit you... Your diving days are numbered. I should have been worrying a lot more about dom that night. I should have been remembering the way that drowned hulk shook and sank. Or the way Theresa hadn't been looking at me, all through supper. But all I could hear going off in my brain was that shark hunter's .30-.30. That crazy rico out there shooting at moonbeams just to let me know he was there. Hanging around in the dark like bad luck. Never too near, never too far. Just waiting to move in on a jackpot. I had to figure some way to dry dock her. Hello, lovey. Hey. We stopped being alone together for a while, huh? Yeah. It's better than being rich. Still got a lot to do. You know, Johnny, I've dived for pennies in my time. And I love the idea of being rich, but... But what? Well, I don't like the idea of you wriggling around in that rotten ol' hulk for one. It's as solid as a rock. It's held together with rust and we all know it. I can swim. Si, Juanito, you can swim. One can sink, too. I won't sink as long as dom's there. That's not what I mean. It's what I mean. What're you going to do? Now, tomorrow, I'm gonna punch a hole in that wreck. We're gonna hook a line... From the wall of the strong room. Make it fast. Turn on the power. And pull it out like a tooth. Ole... Buenos noches. A lousy fortune sitting under our keel and I wasn't losing any part of it. Not to woman, sand, devil or deep water. - Are you all right? - What happened? All right. Cave in. Look... look. Hey, Johnny... Aah. Look, honey. He had a death grip on it. And that's not all, amigo. I felt the rest of the statue with my hands. I did, father. That's fine now. Now, we'll get you down to the cabin. - I'm all right. - Yeah, sure, sure. Come on, now we'll get you below. All right. - Gold, huh? - Absolutely. - Solid? - Heft it. See where it was broken away from the statue, where the fingertips were? Look, honey. Look, look where the fingers were. The whole statue is down there, father. I felt it with my hands. Next thing to do is to bring it up. You bet, Johnny. Right away. Wait a minute, Dominic, not so fast. - How do you feel? - How do I feel? Holding this, this would revive the dead. How goes it with the rocks? Well, it goes well with the rocks. Good. We still have no garbage for you, my friend. We're very busy with our scientific studies, you understand? Why don't you come back some other time? Manana, maybe... My business would take but a few minutes. Some other time. But I wish to make confession. Complacer? - Pasa. - Gracias. Do you understand, father? Out here a priest is rare, yet there's always danger and one would not like to die un-shriven. I understand. Where do you find the opportunity to sin out here? There are always evil thoughts. - Gracias. - Sehor, cafe? Ah, si, por favor, senorita. Senora... - Oh, father? - No, thank you. You're too kind. Well, it is so seldom one has guests in these waters. I suppose you, uh... We won't be seeing you anymore, huh? Uh-huh, quien sabe? You'll probably be moving on down the coast? I follow the sharks and there's no telling where a shark goes or what he does. You know, what a shark is, senora? A shark is a wandering bottomless stomach. People call 'em bad names. Killer, murderer, cannibal. He only hungry. Always on the prowl for something to eat. And for him, anything is food. Even rocks? Si, padre. I have known a shark to swallow even rocks. Adios, padre. - Adios, senora. - Adios. - Gracias. - De nada. Uh, senor herrera. Si? You got fish on your boat? I got some bonito, 40 pounds. Good. You have fish, we have wine. You have dinner with us tonight, huh? A little party. You would not find it dull? I'm only a simple fisherman. Oh, not at all. I accept your invitation, gracias. - Him, too? - Yeah, him, too. And him, too? Yeah. Him, too. What time? - About sundown. - Good. Perhaps, it will not be too dull for you. Hasta luego. - Adios. - Adios. Hasta luego. - Salut. - Salut. Salut. When prohibition came to an end in the United States of north America... I wept, gentleman, I wept. No one believes more ardently in prohibition than I. - Salut. - Salut. Salut. And I wish the United States of north America had never repealed the prohibition law. I was making a fortune smuggling rum into Florida. - Salut. - Salut. - Ah, you are too kind. - That's nothing. - Most hospitable. - Pleasure. Excuse me please, huh? They're very nice, but uncomfortable. And I find you both sympaticos. But first I found you antipatico. But now, sympatico. I'm glad. I have an early morning in the mornin', if you gentlemen will excuse me. Buenos noches, father. - Good night, father. - Good night, father. Ah, si... Muy sympatico. Now when you and senor quesada get me and Miguel and Jesus drunk... What're you gonna do with us? What are you talking about, amigo? I don't get your meaning, friend. Why have we been invited here to eat and drink with you? Because you enjoy his conversation... Or his appearance? Out of long friendship for me? You are both very subtle, like two elephants thrashing around in a circus ring. I was right, yes? Arrivo, senores. Arriva. Johnny. Don't worry, father. Nobody's gonna get hurt. What precautions to safeguard rocks, my friends? I hope you don't mind us using your tow rig. Oh, not at all. Por favor, tell me something. Under the circumstances, it can do no harm. How much gold have you found? - You're imagining things. - Gold? Oh, that much? Gracias. No, we didn't intend to hurt them. But on the way in, our motor got nervous and the tide pulled us inside the breaker line. I don't know who got at us first. The waves or our dinner guests. Hey, you gonna go over there and sit on that rock and watch us, while we get in the skiff start the motor and get it out through the surf. Is that clear? Crystal clear, senor. And no swimming out. You understand? Si, senor, no-no swimming out. Okay, get goin'. Vamanos. A shark on the beach can't hurt anyone. And a little beachcombing might help cure some of rico's evil thoughts. Well... we got 'em on the beach. - Peaceably? - Yes and no. They jumped us. Are they all right? Oh, sure. We'll just put him on ice until this is over. We'll take him some supplies in the morning. Speaking of the morning, Dominic, are you going down there? Sure, chiquita. I never felt better in my life. Knock it off, dom. What are you talking about, "knock it off"? She knows. Besides, you're not diving tomorrow. It's too big a risk. Well... we'll see. Goodnight, chiquita, goodnight, gringuita. Padre... - Good night. - Good night, father. Six o' clock. Well, good night. And you are going under, huh? - Yeah. - Alone? Uh-huh. It's not too risky for you to go under alone, huh? Oh, no. I thought Dominic was your insurance policy. Well, the insurance lapsed. Nobody ever got killed for that. What you want me to do? Take what we have and go home. Oh, what do we have? Each other, for one thing. And if that isn't enough, 50 thousand dollars in gold. 50 thousand dollars is nothing. Oh! What's so funny? Two weeks ago you were walking on air because we were going to break even at the end of the season. Well, I don't get the joke. You're not getting very many jokes these days, Johnny. Well, you just listen to me. I put in a lot of time in the Navy during the war doing underwater demolition. I dived in mine fields with half an army shootin' at me. Now with a million bucks at stake, just because I'm gonna dive alone and might skin my knee, and do you think that's gonna stop me? I want that jackpot. Don't you understand? Yes, I understand, Johnny. But how much do you bet? - A nickel? A hand? An arm... - Whatever... - Your life? - Whatever it takes. - Somebody else's life? - I said whatever it takes. You think I'm gonna quit now, you don't know me. Then that must be it. I don't know you. I guess I never did. Remember the signals, father. One tug, hold her steady. Two tugs, more power. Three tugs, slack off. Don't go down there, Johnny. Don't worry, father. I know what I'm doing. - Just watch for the signals. - I know the signals. Dom! Theresa's caught down there. What's the matter? Winch is stalled. We'll get it started. Drop down another lug. If that thing gets started, give me two. Right. You-you okay, honey? Huh? ? You okay - pom, how are you, chiquita? Good. How'd you get here? We prayed and that little angel came and fetched us. I'm sorry, Johnny. I thought they could help. But they locked father Cannon below. They said he'd be safe. That's alright, Gloria. It's okay. Theresa, honey... Jesus... Johnny, they're taking your gold. Let 'em. Don't worry, gringuita. It's all right. Rico, Mira, Mira! Whoa! A cross. Yeah. From a Madonna and child we found in the wreck. Yeah. It belonged to the cathedral in Panama. It belonged to the church, huh? No, rico, no! What are we gonna do now? You can get in your boat and leave peacefully. Decisions, decisions. What to do? I could kill you. Try it. See what you get from him. Go ahead, amigo. Try it. You would risk your lives? Make a move and see. You like gold that much? This is a matter of principle. You are very generous. Why? You'll never know. I still find you very, very... Simpatico? Si, senor, si, si. - Ay, senor herrera? - Si? We still have no garbage. Adios, senor herrera. Adios, padre. Adios, senora. Adios. Muchas gracias. Padrecito... The statue of the Madonna is gone. Lost. But the gold cross is just down here in the sand, father. - I'll get it for you. - Well, thank you, Johnny. I'll be back. Will you wait for me? I have news for you, Juanito. You are back. Hey! Hey!
