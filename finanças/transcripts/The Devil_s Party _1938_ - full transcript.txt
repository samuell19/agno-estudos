it an accident the guys that murdered this fella Brewster wanted it to look like an accident wait a minute did you say his name was boosted yeah James Brewster what's the matter Marty you know him well he was a very good customer of mine what makes you think he was murdered a big electric sign fell on him only I didn't just fall it was pushed after one of the supporting stanchions have been cut clean with a chisel and why would anybody wanna bump of a nice guy like Brewster that's what we want to know that's why we're going up there tonight to check up if we can break this case they can't keep us out of the bureau well he sure got that old ambition so you're going to stand me up for a murder mystery not until I have that task just a few more minutes one day okay just one dance now

that money I'll skip that what happened well when he didn't get up I was a little worried I figured he might have talked about stopping that check and the Bulls might get curious you see was bruised up a little I told you not to bend that sap over his head quiet Gorn I figured we had to make it look like an accident the wind was blowing a bit that sign was creaking after all it could blow down he'll make it look good we put Brewster onto the sign slip the drink in his hand and push the sign over on it personally I thought it was a pretty good game yeah me too yeah it was marvelous you would
