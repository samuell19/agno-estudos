Do you think I look good on camera? -Yeah. It's a new one. -Luckily, it's part... -Oh. -What? -I don't know. -Come on. Stop. -I just was thinking. I forgot. -No, no, no. You can't. You can't. I don't want you to be thinking. You can't be thinking about this shit. -This sucks. -See? That's exactly what you can't do... -Yeah, but this just happens every time we go out. -Because you ruin it and then you make me feel guilty. Yeah. But it doesn't matter, okay? -What are you gonna do about Daisy? -Don't fucking -- don't fucking ever say her name again, okay? You guys aren't even friends, okay? I should be more concerned because I'm fucking my, uh, my best friend's girlfriend, okay? -Just -- just -- just -- just hear me out for a second. -You have to just get rid of him, okay? And just forget about it. -Why would I... -And just have fun tonight. And just forget about him and move on. -I don't wanna have... I wanna talk for a second! Just talk to me for one second! Ah! What the hell is wrong with you? -Are you fucking kidding me? I told you I'm not talking about this. -Oh, my God. -Get back here. Come over here. Come here. Are you fucking kidding me? Hey. Hey. Kathy. -I can't even see straight. -Kathy. Kathy. Kathy. Kathy. Kathy. Kathy. Kathy, come here. -What?! I hear you! -Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Just chill out. Calm down. -Get off of me! -Hey. Listen. Look at me. Look at me. -I don't wanna look at you. I think you're disgusting. -Yeah? -Yeah. -You think I'm disgusting? -Mm-hmm. Get -- get the camera out of my face! -You're a fucking whore, and you're crazy, okay? I'm just fuckin' you, so... -Are you ser-- -You'll fucking leave fucking Tim alone. All right? And I swear to God if you fuck up... -You need some serious... -Anything with me and Daisy... -Serious... -I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. -Serious, serious help. -Get back over here. -Don't touch me! -All right. Then get the fuck out. -Get that out of my face. -Get the fuck out now. -Why are you filmin' me? -'Cause this is a new camera. -Why? You're film... -Just chill out. You're filmin' me 'cause it's a new camera. -First of all... -I -- I can't get in touch with Kathy today. -Okay. All right. Slow down. Okay. It's early in the morning. I was drinking... -No, it's not early in the morning. -All night last night -It's f-- it's four... -I passed out on the couch. -It's 4:15 in the afternoon. -Okay. That's a little excessive, I agree. -Okay. Uh, yeah, it is excessive. How late did you stay out last night? -What did Kathy tell you? -Nothing! I haven't been able to get in touch with her! -Oh. All right. -Well... -I thought this was a... You know, she stayed... -How late did you guys stay out last night? -Well, she came back here. I thought you knew that. -Kathy came back here last night? -Yeah. Because she would've gone home with some fuckin' douche at a fuckin' club because she's always flirting with other guys, man. Look, I love you. You're a good-lookin' kid. Need to find another girl. Like, forget about it already, okay? -You love me? I'm a good-- What are you, my fucking grandfather? -I'm just, I don't understand. I just... look, dude. -Don't -- don't -- don't -- Hey, hey, look, "I love you. You're a good-lookin' kid." You need to shave your fuckin' beard. You need to get your fuckin' act together. -Right. -You need to stop drinkin' as much as you're fuckin' drinking. -So you don't trust me anymore? -And stop having my fucking girlfriend or whatever the fuck she is sleep here! -You don't trust me? -I trust you fine, but it's shady! -Okay. So fine. Stop calling me shady. I hate when you call me shady. -Then stop acting like a shady motherfucker! -Just don't tell Daisy that she fuckin' slept over, I don't need her fucking ganging up on me like usual. -I won't tell Daisy. Don't worry. We'll cover up your shit. -I need to fucking sell something, sell a fucking show, and make some fuckin' money already. All right? Just chill out. This is, like, this is the downfall of fuckin' Daniel, man. Um, no one's fucking trusting me. And it's like everyone's fucking against me. It's, like, just me against the fuckin' world. But I'll tell you what, like, Tim's gonna trust me again. Daisy will trust me again. Fuck Kathy, that fuckin' bitch. I'm, like, into recording all of this because I have, like, this crazy fucking idea to, uh... They'll all see. They'll all see. Like, I'm fucking, like... Just watch. I'm worth it. And, like, I have got the coolest fucking reality show idea ever. And, um, just, I'm gonna set it up. It's gonna be fucking amazing. ** [ Rustling ] All right. This video was posted about a year ago. I'm surprised, uh, how few people have commented on it. Uh, the ranger station on Turtle Island, a small islet... Uh, okay. Let's see. The ranger station -- the ranger station on Turtle Island, an enclave... Ah, fuck... I'm just gonna do it with glasses to look a little smarter for my female fans in TV Land. This video was posted over a year ago. I'm surprised how few hits it has. That sounds like a really stupid thing to say. This video was posted over a year ago. I'm surprised how little attention it's gotten. The ranger station on Turtle Island in Vermont claims this was a rare bear attack. Doesn't look like any bear I know. Oh, that's 'cause you're human, and you don't know any bears. It's my job to uncover the uncanny on "Fiend Finders," episode one: "Bigfoot: He Really Does Exist." It's just the microphone. You all right? Just... you can look at me. It's just the mic. Do you want some water or something? -No. No problem. Let's go. Come on. -Can you tell us a little bit about Turtle Island? -What can I tell ya? If I tell ya to go, you might think it's not dangerous enough. But if I tell ya not to go, you'll go anyway, right? -I know that you don't wanna state your name. And we're, um, disguising your identity. Can't really make out your face. I -- I saw that video you posted on the Internet. In fact, I'm using it to open my TV show. -Look, I -- I -- I... -Your video's been up on the Internet for quite some time. Would you say it's encouraged a lot of people to head to Vermont? -I don't see why we need the camera here, okay? I don't see why we need this camera. -'Cause it's -- it's part of the interview. Sir, can we just... Come back. -Uh, you didn't say anything about the camera before. -I know. -So what are we doing now? Look, turn it off, and I'll tell you all about the stuff. But you didn't say anything about a camera. -Is there anything more you can say? What if I joined you in the interview right here? Can you just... Come -- come back here. Come back here for a moment. [ Muffled groans ] -Do not scream. -If you don't mind... Come on. Come back in frame. We can do it in... I'll interview with you. Uh, if -- I -- if you're worried about seeing your face, it's fine. -Yeah, it's... I am worried about seeing my face. -I told you, I promise. -So why not just... -We'll sign waiver, it's -- it's not an issue, but... -So why... -We're getting the good stuff. Just if you sit down, I'll come in and join you. -All right. -I apologize if I wasn't clear earlier. Thanks for sitting back down. We're -- we're basically shooting a pitch for a TV network. It's a show I came up with called "Fiend Finder." And, um, we're gonna try to uncover various myths. -It's not a myth, you asshole. Okay? I mean, you gotta see this to believe it, plain and simple. -Okay. -And bring some of your fuckin' friends too, all right? -All right. We're gonna bleep some of this out, but we plan on bringing America along for the ride. -Well, you prom-- that's what you promise, right? I mean, that's the whole fuckin' reason I came over here in the fuckin' first place, right? -Since you tipped me off about Turtle Island, I've been very intrigued. Again, I appreciate, uh, the video. -Good. -And that's really got my juices flowing. -Good. Are we done here? -There are mixed reports -- there are mixed reports that it's bullshit, though. I gotta be honest. And this is part of the drama that we wanna uncover. Uh, some message boards, uh, even said that locals are dressing up to mess around, uh, with tourists. That's --that's a direct quote. Um, is there any truth to these accusations, or... -Look, look. You can believe whatever the hell you want, okay? -Mmm. I'm telling you, you gotta see this for yourself. It is real. -Have you seen -- you've seen it? -Have I seen it? -Yeah. -Have I seen it? -Yes. -Yeah, I've seen it. I've seen it dozens of times. I've been there many times. I've seen it. They're run in and -- and out, and... Yeah. -So you can... -Seen it. -You can attest to these unexplained deaths, people's faces getting ripped off, mouths getting ripped off? People have seen this. So you're -- you know about this? Are you in on this? You... -Wait. Wait. -I mean, you --you --you -- you've witnessed this type of stuff? Is that what you're saying? -I've -- I... -This is... -Uh, I gotta go. -So is this true? -No. I gotta... -Well, sit back down. We're finally getting somewhere. -No. No, I gotta go. -Wait. You have to take the mic off. Come here. -I sat outside of her office the other day. I feel like a fuckin' idiot. -Yeah. How long... When did this happen? When did you guys break up? -Uh, a week. Week ago. -Yeah. -Long night. Long night. And, uh, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I, you know, we've been down this road before. She seems to have other priorities than this thing. And, uh, I don't know. I think -- I think -- I think it's done this time. -Well, I got just the perfect solution for you because... And thank you. You're such a good friend to not even ask why I'm filming you because I always take my camera. -Bro, I'm so used to it. Come on. You're always sticking the thing in my face. -So let me tell you about -- let me tell you about this idea. It's called "Fiend Finder." So first of all, how's the name? -It's terrible. -Okay. -It's terrible. -Ready for -- ready for the elevator pitch? -Elevator pitch? -What -- What if those bedtime stories came true? What if Transylvania exists? Actually, it does exist, doesn't it? -Transylvania does exist, I think. -But what about Dracula existing? -I don't know. -What if Bigfoot existed? -This is really your idea? -That's my idea. Feel better. Um, one night of camping. We digest the relationship, four-star hotel it afterwards, little couples' massages, ya know? -Couples massages? We're gonna go -- we're gonna go get couples' massage... And this is supposed to make me feel better or worse? -Well, Daisy and I are gonna have a couple's massage. And then, you know... -Oh, come on. -Depending on... What? I haven't seen her in a while. I was out of town. -You're talkin' about... Okay. After everything I just tell you... -We'll bring her friend. -Guys' night... -We'll bring Laura. -Camping... -We'll bring Laura. Yeah. Look at -- look at this over there. Ooh. That's what we're gonna find in Vermont, baby. -No, that's not what we're gonna find in Vermont. -Yeah, you know it is. -That's what we're gonna find in New York City, which is why I'm not going to Vermont. -I'm gonna put my Big -- Bigfoot in that Turtle Island. You know what I'm saying? -Yeah. -All right. Cool. So why don't we start with your name? Tell me everything, uh, you know, about yourself and when you started to get interested in, uh, in Bigfoot. -My name is Bruce Barraclow. Um, I'm the founder of Northeastern Anonymous Research. And we pretty much go around everywhere doin' paranormal investigations as well as cryptozoology investigations. And that's the study of Bigfoot, Jersey Devil, Loch Ness monster. -So why don't you tell me about kind of, uh, how you got into Bigfoot and... -I got into Bigfoot, uh, young. I believe I was about 11 years old. And, uh, we used to go campin' a lot. There was a military campground out in West Point, upstate New York. And it's, uh, full of military personnel and their family. So my father, bein' in the military, would take us up there, uh, every summer. We'd go all day long, you know. Uh, one particular night after a fire, we went into the tent. And my father was fast asleep. My sister went to sleep. Uh, I was gettin' ready to go there. I thought my mother was asleep. And then all of a sudden, I hear my mother scream there's an... See, I -- I wanna say it the way she said it, but I can't on the camera. Uh... -You can say it. Say it. -"There's a fuckin' ape lookin' into the top of the tent." Uh, so my father jumps up, gets his sidearm, runs out the tent and actually sees something goin' through by the -- this big boulder that was close to the, uh, campgrounds. And, uh, he didn't see nothin' after that. I had a woman by the name of Alex Evans. She's an amazing sketch artist. And she did this sketch for me right here of what I seen. And so right in front of the tree. And as I was sittin' there, uh, lookin' at this thing, I still get a little, uh, emotional talkin' about it 'cause it's something that just you never think is really gonna happen to ya. -Daisy, wake up, baby. Daisy. Daisy, wake up. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's Tim. It's Tim. -Babe, would you, like, put the camera down and help me? -What are you gonna do with the bag and the, uh, you know... -What do you mean, what are we gonna do with the bag? -Well, I told him that I'm cooking dinner tonight, so... -You don't cook. -Of course I do. -No, you don't. Um, you can cook Rama Lama Ding Dong? What is this? Come on. Seriously. They're gonna be here any second. If want the joke to work then -- -You have to plate it. -You need to help me. -Just -- just -- just... Just plate it? -Humor me. Yeah. That's it. -You're difficult. -Get the nice China. -Oh, so you -- so you mean all the take-out stuff, you don't -- you don't wanna use this? -No. -Fine. -Seriously. We gotta put it in the oven too. So maybe we should put it in, like, a baking sheet or something. -Yeah. 'Cause you -- 'cause you put, um... -Here, I'll do it. Put mixed greens on a baking sheet. I'll -- I'll do it if you come grab the camera. -All right. All right. Okay. Come here. -Come on. -Okay. Ow! I just hit my head. -Oh, man. This looks horrible. Seriously, where are the pots? -I don't -- I don't know. You're the chef. You figure it out. -I'm not fucking around. We're gonna do this. -Do you want me to give you your shit back? -You're makin' me nervous. -Mm-hmm. Are you sweating a little bit? -How do you cook... Would you put Pad Thai in, like, a pot? -Um, sure. Yeah. -I think so. -Yeah. -Now I have some stuff going. -Put it in the muffin pan. See what happens. -Things... It's gonna be awkward to... -Ew. It's like a block of noodles. -Yeah. Check that out. Convince you that you should come to Vermont. -Oh, Daisy, 100 percent. -Daisy convinced you? -I'm a very persuasive lady. What can I say? -Sorry. -Oh, very... -I have you wrapped around my little finger. -Oh, you've got everyone wrapped around your little finger. -I know this. -She does. -Oh, my God. -Oh, yeah. -Creepy cam? -What do you mean, "Oh, yeah?" -I -- I told you he does this. It's weird, but we love him anyway. -You told me he does this, but how... -You know we're going to Vermont. -All the time? -Yeah. We need to just... -Do you have actual relationships? -The whole thing. -Yup. -Backstory. It's good. It's good for the show. -Drama. Make it sizzle, baby. -What show? -It's called... -Wow. -"Fiend Finders." Really? -I couldn't tell her because she wouldn't come. -Really? What are you, his --his little henchman? -I should've known. I should've known, Daniel. You -- you would absolutely pull something. All right. Come here. Give it to me. -Why? What are you doing? -You should be in it too. -I don't think so. -Absolutely. The documentarian has to be in his own movie. -Okay. -Oh. -Oh, my God. This is heavy. -Oh my. -Givin' up the power. -It's a challenge. -Goodness gracious. What a workout. -I know, it's heavy. Be careful. It's very expensive. -Oh, my God. Okay. All right, Mr. Documentarian. -Oh, my. Someone's camera-ready. -I'm camera-ready. I'm ready to go. -Yeah? -Ask me anything. -Where did you get those pants? -Where'd I get these pants? I, um... -They're lovely pants. -I don't know. They're old pants. -Mmm. Look at those pants. -They're old pants. You're panning me up and down like... -Did you always wanna be a documentarian? -I did. I did. When I was younger, I wanted to be a pizza man, but since then I wanna be a documentarian. Okay. Enough's enough. -I don't think so. I think there's something that you're not telling us. -There's a lot I'm not telling you. -Tell us about your first kiss. -My first kiss? -Uh-huh. -Uh, it was wet and painful. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. You got... Let me get that. Now step out of the way. Step out of the way. -What? -I'm recording them right now. -You weirdo. You can't even hear them. -Of course I can. I put a mic in the table. -Shut the fuck up. -Yeah. This'll be great to -- -Babe... -Rewind and listen to. -Babe, you're taking it to a new level. What are we gonna do, lay in bed and listen to them? -Look at these guys. All right. I'll be him. You be her. -Okay. Okay. "Oh, this pillow has some lint. Oh, look at you. You're s-- so charming." -"Yeah. Yeah. I like pillows. They're fun. They're really good." -"I'm a little bit drunk. I had one glass of Pinot Grigio." -"I have too. Yup. Yeah, I'm gonna take -- totally take advantage of you." -Please. Please, you have to let me go. He's crazy. Please. Please. Please. Please. I'm the girl that sat in front. We tried to help you. Please. -Shut up. He's gonna cut off another finger. -I don't have any more fingers. -When he was 16 years old, he got, uh, suspended from school for trying to do a documentary about what happens in the girls' bathroom. -Oh, of course he did. -Yeah. -It was called... -And what happened? -It was called "The Secret Hole." -Oh. It was not called that. -That's a brilliant title. -It was, you know. -Class act, always. -Who -- who drilled the hole, by the way? -Oh, really? -Okay. Yeah. -Wow. -All right. Yeah. -That is double trouble. You act like you're a good boy now. -Oh, by the way... -Come on. You have the equipment? Do you have the gear? -I don't know. Dais and I weren't so good. -Absolutely not. -I have the sleeping bags. I have the pan. Uh... -Do you have the lanterns? -We... Last time we went camping we didn't bring lanterns. And we got there and there and we were using our fuckin' cell phones to take a piss. -Please, please, please bring... -Yeah. The bathroom situation makes me very nervous. I'm... -Yeah. -You know... -What makes me very nervous is how used to the camera Laura's getting. -Oh. -She doesn't know that I turned it on. -Cheers, camera. I don't even care anymore because, I mean, what am I supposed to do at this point? -Oh! -Someone's a little drunk! -How much wine did we have, Missy? -I don't even know. -I think she had an entire glass. -Several years ago, my wife had a strange encounter in the northeastern part of New Jersey about an hour or so from where we live outside of the New York City ar-- area. Um, she was on a class trip. And -- and as she left, it was in the middle of the night, somewhere around 2 or 3 in the morning. She heard a horribly loud and -- and upsetting noise. Uh, it was very... It really disturbed her. It was not -- unlike anything she had seen before or had heard before. And it was, uh, this -- this loud screaming noise that was coming from the woods. They all heard this noise. It kept going. And it was very loud and -- and very unearthly, nothing like -- nothing she'd ever heard before. They were ongoing. They lasted for probably 15 minutes or so. Um, and she said they were strangely human-like. -So the ranger and everyone just assumed these were the creature sound, not the sounds of someone maybe being attacked? -Mmm. Yeah. I guess they weren't concerned that it was a -- a human in distress, I suppose. Or the -- the policemen would've investigated it. But... -It may... could have been. -It could've been, I suppose. There's not too many people out there in the middle of the woods at night, but, you know, that might have been prudent. I don't know. -You ever hear anything happen in Vermont? -My sister has been living in Vermont for over 35 years. And, uh, and I -- I hear things from her. Um, she's -- she said there's, uh, quite a few people that have seen things. -Daisy! -Dan. -What? -Oh, my God. -Dan. -Shit. -Excuse me. -Oh, what do we have here? -Just shavin' my legs, sir. -Ooh. Your little English -- little English accent come out, little Veronica? -Sometimes I throw a Veronica when I'm shaving my legs, yes. Does it turn you on a bit? -It actually does. That better not be my fuckin' razor. -Oh my goodness. I think it is. -Oh, no. -Oopsies. I'm so sorry. -Are you kidding me? -I'm not kidding at all. Now if you don't turn off that camera, I'm gonna go for the armpits. -No. -It's happening. -No. Nope. It's happening. It's getting closer. Getting closer. -No. Seriously. -Turn off the camera. Turn off the camera. -Jesus, you're a terrible driver. -I know. This traffic sucks a big ol' dick. You know, Laura, speaking of dicks, you know what story I was thinking of a couple days ago? -Oh, God. What? -No, this is a fun little road trip anecdote. It's a good one. -Somehow I think I'll just wait. -I think we were about 15. And Laura was with Doug. -Oh, no. -Doug. Yes. -No. No. No. No. No. Not this one. -And... yup. You know where I'm going. -Please no. Not with the camera running. -And my parents were out of town. So she asked to come over because the rest of us were, like, bad asses, running around the city like... all, like, sexy and wild. -Yeah. You were a real wild ass. -And Laura finally was like, "I'm gonna get on the train. I'm gonna get on the oral sex train. I'm gonna be the conductor of it." -Oh, jeez. -Dude, I never said that. -We had bananas, we had cucumbers, we had baby carrots. -No! Whatever she wanted to practice on. She refused. -Baby carrots? -So this is your own damn fault. She starts unbuttoning his Banana Republic pleated khakis. -Oh, God. -And -- and as she takes his undies off, she starts just gently blowing... on his, hopefully erect, penis. -Oh, yeah. -You gave him -- you gave him a fan job. You gave him a fanny. And you were gonna give her a banana to suck when she was 15 years old? -Right. It's that big. -Dirty girl. -Documentarian Laura taking the camera. -Look at you. -Hey, Tim. -Hey. -Hey. Actually, I have no idea how you and Daisy know each other. -This traffic's insane. -Uh, we went to college together. -Oh, right, right, right. -Yeah. Um, the first day we met, we both took, tryin' to kill credits, took this basic acting class. -Shut up. -Yeah. -You took an acting class? -Moi? -Of course she did. -Obviously. -That's amazing. -But anyway, so I'm 18 years old, and when I was in high school, I was obsessed and wanted to be Eminem. So I shaved my head and bleached it, like, white. -Shut up. Shut up, really? -Miss Daisy was obsessed with Pink. And so she comes into class with her hair half pink. -I remember this. -My parents flipped their shit. -Yes, and your mom almost disowned you. -Little Miss Rebellion. But, uh, Mr. Drocher takes one look at us and he goes, "Um, are we here..." -What -- what the fuck was his name? -Mr. Drocher. -Mr. Drocher. He was, like, 900 years old. -Has all the wisdom. -Has, like, tenure then, right? -A little bit. -Well... -So what happened? -He said... -Anyway, he -- he... so he looks at us and he goes, "Are you two interested in being famous or are you interested in being actors?" And Daisy looks at him and goes, "Both. Why else would you do it?" He kicked her ass out of class so quick. And on principle, I stood up and walked out with her. And ever since then... tight. -Wow. What was that motion? -Was it ever -- it ever go beyond that, this relationship? -Wait, what? -I still have no idea how you wooed this girl. What'd you do? -I don't know. -Probably drugged her. Probably drugged her. And now he's got some shit on her. And he's, uh, holdin' her hostage. -I'm drugged right now, so it's scary that I'm drivin'. -Shut up. -No, we met... it was romantic, actually. We were talking about this the other day. She reached for my hand outside of this bar. She thought I was someone else. And she pulled me inside. So I followed her. And, like, halfway through the club she, like, turns around and she realizes it's me. She's like, "Eh, not bad, you know? Easy on the eyes." -Jesus. -We go to the bar. She starts ordering tequila, which is a fuckin' nightmare. And, uh, I take the first shot and was just, like, "this fuckin' sucks." You know, 'cause I can't handle tequila anymore. And take the second one, third one. By that time, I'm done. But I have to keep up with this girl. -Yeah. You have to put your big boy pants on. -Between the fourth and fifth, I bent down, and I vomited on my feet. Wiped my mouth, came back up, ready to go. -See, that's the part of the story that she's told me. -Needless to say, we did not kiss that night. -That wasn't... we didn't kiss. Yeah. -We did not kiss. -That wasn't the first night we kissed. Um, we fucked. We just didn't kiss. -Hey, right. Right. -All right. Turn the camera off. -Okay. Watch your step. Watch your step. All right. Um. -Timmy boy. -Yes, Danny boy? -Tell the folks at home a little -- little about yourself. -Well, my name is Tim. If you've... haven't gotten that yet. Uh, I work and live in New York in real estate. Uh, mostly the Murray Hill area. I can't stand a lot of the people that I find apartments for, but what are you gonna do? It pays the bills. How you doin'? -Why -- why do... why are you coming -- why are you coming on this thing? What do you -- what do you offer the expedition? -What do I offer the expedition? -Yeah. -Uh, well, according to my friend Daniel here, I -- offer the ability to beat up Bigfoot if we run into him and there's any problems. -Right. You have any experience at tracking -- tracking monsters? -Uh, lots. Lots. I, uh, I led an expedition in Loch Ness for 2 months. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Looking for the -- looking for the beast. No, I have no experience tracking monsters, per se. -So it seems like, uh, you're a non-believer. -For you, my friend, I believe in you. I don't know that I believe in Bigfoot. Uh, but I believe in you. -Right. Dais, get in here. -Hi. -Beautiful Daisy, what's up? Tell us a little -- little about yourself. -Um, my name is Daisy. Um, born and raised in New York City. -Is that your real name? -Yes. My real name. Thanks, mom and dad. Really appreciate it. Um, and I sorta -- I started a T-shirt line, but that kinda fell by the wayside. And now I think I'm gonna get my yoga, too. Hey, hey, hey, hey, up here, buddy. Cute. Cute. -You think you're gonna get your what? -I think I'm gonna get my yoga teacher's license. I don't know. -Oh, that's good. -I'll figure it all out. -Cool. -Yeah. -And who's your best friend in all the world? -Laura. -Where's she? -That -- that broad over there. -Oh, there she is. -Beautiful Laura. -Hello Daniel. -Come in. Don't be shy. -Hey, baby. -Hey. -Oh, a double interview. -Is this her time to shine? -Why don't you guys kiss? Why don't you guys kiss? No? -No. We did that when we were 12. -It was very mouthy. -Very mouthy. -Very awkward. Teeth bumping. -What's up, Daniel? -Tell me a little bit about yourself. -Um, my name's Laura. -Yeah. -Um, I'm a social media expert. -Take off your -- your glasses. I wanna see those lovely eyes. -Oh, God. Now that I'm slightly less hungover from last night. -How do you feel about... yeah, last night was crazy. Between me and you, he's over there. He's not even paying attention. What -- what happened? Anything? -Nothing. -No? -I'm a gentleman. -Yeah. -You know, I started hearing some stories from the island. And so I wanted to go see for myself. And I... so I started taking a lot of walks up there with my dog, Zappa. But one day we were up there. And, uh, I noticed Zappa just, like, froze next to me. So I looked up and, um, there it was. It was this, I mean, like, 7-foot, huge, man-shaped thing. Um, and he had, like, shaggy, sort of dirty, white hair. Um, and I just, you know, I just froze. And... so we were sort of staring at each other. And then he walked back into the woods. And, um, Zappa just took off after him. And I tried -- I tried to stop him, but, uh, he was a border collie. So, you know, their instinct, like, is to herd things. That's, you know, they're wired for it. It's what we bred them to do. And, um, 'cause I just... I heard this sound. It was, um, you know like when you step on your dog's tail and it's, like, it's sort of like almost a scream, and it's just horrible? Um, it was like that but, like, 10 times worse. -Why'd you go in the first place? -I don't know. Um... -Would you ever go again? -No. I didn't think it would be like that. Uh, you know, I was excited to see Bigfoot. But no, I wouldn't go again. -All right. Thanks a lot. -Sure. -We're in Vermont. -Oh. -Woo-hoo! Welcome to Vermont. -About fuckin' time. -There's no state line or anything. -You just missed it, Documentarian. You missed your moment. -We missed it. -All right. -Yo, look at my artsy camera shot. -You like it? You getting used to it? -I love it. -Just keep it, uh, stable. -Don't move it all around. -It's stable. Don't you worry. -Really? -Yeah. She -- she actually teaches lessons at the Y, and I was, like, "Oh..." -Oh. Look at that girl. -Walk of shame, babe. -Whoa, whoa. No. No. No. No. -Walk of shame. -Someone had a rough night. -She was wasted. -Really, stop the car. -Why? -She doesn't look okay. -Oh, stop. She's fine. -No, she's like a... did you see her? -Laura -- Laura, she's hung over. -I just wanna make sure. Come on. -We gotta make the reservation, Laura. -Come on. -Hey! Sweetie. Hold on one second. -Hold on one second? What are you gonna go... -You okay? -She gonna go give her an Advil? -Hey, sweetie, are you okay? -Are you getting this, man? What's going on? -I don't know. She's such a fucking goody-two-shoes. -Maybe she can get some -- from her. -Uh, oh. Got the attention. -Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. -Whoa. -What the fuck? -Serves you right, psycho. -Get back in the car. -Oh, my God. -Yo, that is how they roll in Vermont. -She's just standing there, now. -Turn the car on. Let's go. -Yo. She is just fucking standing there. -Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on. -All right. Let's go. -She's like a fucking crack addict or something. -Crack addict. Maybe a meth head. -Can't complain. We are in Vermont, right? -What do you mean? -The car's not starting. -Holy shit. The girl's gone, man. -Seriously? -What the fuck? -What's goin' on? -Whoa. -All right. Come on. Let's get out of here. -She went back to her people in the woods. -All right. Let's go. -I'm... It's not working. It's not turning on. -What do you mean it's not turning on? -The car's not turning on. -Did we run outta gas? -Um, I don't know. -Oh, what the fuck? -I wasn't paying attention to the gas gauge. -We're gonna miss the kayaks now. -Oh, shit. -Good work, Laura. -You weren't paying attention to the gas gauge? Fuckin' idiot. -How's this Laura's fault? -'Cause we... she wanted to fuckin' stop. It's fuckin' ridiculous. -I just... -Oh, right. -Dan. -Because that broke the car. -Oh, my God. -Oh, somebody's gonna go pout. -I just wanted to make sure she was okay. -Way to go, Laura. -I don't know -She's... -Ah! -Ah! -Fuck you! Fuck you! -What a dick. I love it. -Get in the car. -All right. Should we call triple A? -Yeah. -Yeah. What's the number? -Baby -- baby, there's a hair on one of the pillows. There's a hair on a pillow. Where... -I'm sure there's more than one hair. -Oh -- oh, my gosh. Get me outta here. -Oh, look at this ash tray. -It smells -- it smells like old people are dead in the bathtub. That's what it smells like. -They probably were. This is your fault. This is your fault. -Oh, it's my fault? -If we didn't pick up the sociopath on the side of the road, we'd be camping. And then you'd be at a four-star hotel. -That's what I get for trying to be a good person. -All right. Well, let's just get over it. It was hysterical that you made them stay in their own room. So let's just... -I didn't -- I didn't know, I mean, uh, Tim's kind of a cheapskate. -I think they're still having a cigarette outside. -I figured it would say them money. Are they out there? -I think so. -Oh, still there. -Okay. I feel bad about this spying. Please just give them a break. They've been such good sports all day. Just leave 'em alone. -I should've miked the pack of cigs. I thought they didn't smoke, first of all. They just steal cigarettes from me just 'cause they don't fuckin' smoke. -They just make fun of us and then... -Oh, my God. He's really lookin' up at the stars just like he used to do in high school. -Yeah, that's kinda one of his moves. -Yup. -Yup. -Their -- their faces are quite close. -Ooh! -He's like, "Look! I can see Uranus!" That's good. -Okay. Leave him alone. You've been on his case all day. Just stop it. -Oh, man. He's gonna try to kiss her. -Give him some privacy. -He's gonna try to fuckin' kiss her. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -Daniel. -Holy shit. She just turned away. She just turned away. This is ridiculous. -She gave him the cheek? -This is the most awkward thing I've ever seen. -Turn the camera off. Stop it. -No, this is very interesting. -You know what's interesting? -What? Something over here's really interesting, I think. -Just come look at this. -No. I think you should turn around. I think that's more important. -What? What? Oh, shit. -This is interesting, right? -It is. That's very interesting. -Yeah. Turn the camera off. -No, I think I'll just keep this rolling tonight. -No, I think you should turn it off. -No, I'm gonna keep it up. -No, I think the clothes are goin' back on. -No. No. No. No. -Oh, I'm so sorry. No. No. No. No. All right. I'll put it down. I'll put it down. I'll put it down. -Greg, you there? Hey. -What's up, Danny? How are you? -I can't believe this is working. I'm in fuckin' Vermont right now. I'm literally -- I'm literally at, uh, like in a gas station bathroom. And I'm about to go kayaking. It's a nightmare. What's up? -What exactly are you doing? I'm, you know, I'm tryin' to sell this show called "Fiend Finder," essentially it's tryin' to prove different myths. I know it's crazy. I -- I haven't sold a show in a year. And you know, money's now an issue. And okay, look, anyway we gotta... We'll edit that out. Here's the point, uh, uh, if you had to argue this, all right, if you had to argue the point in court of Bigfoot existing, where would you begin? 'Cause it... -I really wouldn't wanna argue that point in court. But if I had to do it, uh, the first thing I'd say is it's not necessarily a monster. Everyone's making this out to be some sort of new species. But I... There are humans out there who actually look like what people think Bigfoot is supposed to look like. There is a -- a rare genetic disorder called hypertrichosis. And it causes you to grow hair on every inch of your body -- your nose, your cheeks, your eyelids. And maybe someone was born with hyper -- hypertrichosis who's -- who's 7-foot tall and very strong and, uh, and that's Bigfoot. So maybe it's a human. -All right. -The other thing I would say is that every single year in this country there are countless unexplained deaths and disappearances in the woods. What's exactly is causing that? And, uh, I would offer that, and this is something I probably wouldn't tell Daisy when you're camping this weekend, but, um, what if, in fact, there was a very strong, very tall, criminally insane psychopath that decided to buy a Bigfoot costume, maybe equip it with real animal claws, put it on and just go to town in the woods on campers like you. I think that would be a pretty good way. And then finish up, take the costume off, go about the rest of your day, rest of your night. I don't know. I think it might work. -That's why you're my big brother, adding some nice drama to "Fiend Finder." I appreciate that. That's pretty fucked up, man. That's some fucked up shit. I didn't even think of that. -Uh, yeah. It is fucked up. It is fucked up. But it's probably happened. And it's probably happening right now. -Oh, Jesus. [ Groaning ] [ Muttering ] Fuckin' bitch with the flare. Fuckin' flare. -Pulling up to the kayak spot. -When is the last time we think this guy has seen a living human being? -Oh, shit. -Oh, man. -Yo, he's playin' chess with someone. -What do you think he's reading? -Who? -The voice in his head, maybe? -The bible. -"How to Murder People Who Rent Your Kayak." -Yeah. Maybe. -Fuck this. -Nice day for this. -Not gonna kayak in this shit. -My friend, how ya doin'? -Hey, how's it goin', folks? -Hi. -Hey, what's up? -How are you? -I'm Jack. Nice to meet ya. -Hi, Jack, Daisy, nice to meet you. -Daisy. Jack. Tim. -Hey, I'm Laura. -Hi. Nice to meet you. -Hi. -Hey, what's up? Daniel. -Hi, nice to meet ya. What's this about? -Uh, do you mind if we... -Winnin' your chess game? -Filmed a little? Shootin' a little, uh, uh, TV show pilot thing. -All right. -Do you mind if we... -Uh, no. No. That's cool. But, uh, are you guys gonna rent some kayaks? -Guys, just hang out in the back for a second. I wanna just interview him. Yeah. Do you mind if they just... -Yeah. They can check those out. They're cool, two-seaters. -Oh, shit. It's raining. -Oh, great. -Hey, let's hide under the kayaks. -Yeah! -Are we gonna be able to hang out here until the storm passes over, you know? -Yeah, it's cool. I got some, uh, satellite TV. -All right. -Some snacks. -Oh! -The rains come-and-go. -Laura, come here for a second. Hold the camera. Let me interview him quick... -Oh, jeez. -Before it gets too rainy. -Yeah. Shit. -So... Are you keeping it a little stable? -Yes, I'm keeping it stable. -Okay. So, Jack... Turtle Island. -Yeah, Turtle Island. Uh, okay. The rundown is... -Yup. -It's a great spot if you're young and foolish. I went there many times myself. -Yeah. -And if you're old and foolish as well. -Got a little high, a little drunk. -Yeah. -Old and foolish, yeah. -Right. Uh... -So we heard rumors that people can't really get to the island because if a ranger comes... -Yeah. -Uh, it's jail time or something. -It's serious business now. -But people hang out around there. -Yeah, so, like, a buddy of mine, uh, he, uh, he went there... -Serious business. -Six years ago -- six years, I think, ago. -All right. Yeah. -And, uh... -What? They smoke a little? -Well, I wasn't there with him. [ Thunder rolling ] -But he said he saw somethin' and he lost his... -Get out of the frame? Come here. Come here. Come back here. -Daniel, can we, like, hurry this up, please? -Make it sound a little more dangerous than it is. -I'm sorry. I'm not Hollywood, so -- -It's fine. It's fine, just look into the camera and say would you recommend going to Turtle Island. -No. Don't go to Turtle Island, guys. -All right. So we won't go to Turtle Island, right. -And don't take my kayaks there either, seriously. -All right. -All right? -Come on, guys. Let's go. It's fun and games nowadays. Fun and games. -You wanna help a little bit, maybe? Maybe? - -You got our lifevests in there? -Not really. -Yeah, I do. -Any last words? -Yeah, put the fuckin' camera down and get your ass to work. -Daisy, I'd like you to put that straight on. -Um, I would, but it has bird shit all over it, so... -Oh, bird shit. -Sorry. -Bird shit on Turtle Island. Come with me over here and see what we got. No trespassing on the island. It's very dangerous. This is where the adventure begins. This is where our lives may end, on "Fiend Finder," finding fiends. -Jack. -Turtle Island... -Here's some jellybeans, should we take the jellybeans? -Calm, serene, dangerous. You can see it in the background. -Huh? -And, uh, by the way, did you not change your shirt last night, dirty boy? -Yeah. We were supposed to be wearin' this for kayaking, which was supposed to happen yesterday. -And then what happened? -But somebody fucked up. -Your girlfriend, uh, pulled over for someone. -Oh, yeah, 'cause that's what broke the car. -Yeah. -How 'bout poor planning on your part? -How 'bout you didn't deny -- -Once again. -That there's a new couple on the block. -Oh. -Oh. Is that your IQ or how many friends you have? -Fuck you. -Speaking of... -Yeah, seriously. -We got more shit. -We got more bags back here. -So rude. So rude. -So rude? Look at you. -Yeah. -I think we might be the only sane ones here. -Look how beautiful you are. -Oh, yeah. A closeup of my eyeball. -Laura, hate to see you leave. But I love to watch you go. -Come on, help us with this shit. -All right. [ Shuddering ] -You okay? -Yeah, I think so. -Okay. Okay. -You look kinda weird, though. -Yo, Tim, come on. -Can I get some knee dusting please? -Come on. Catch up to the girls. You're rowing... -Yeah, brother. I'm one person paddling. -You're rowing like a girl. -I row like a girl. -I was paddling for the past 45 minutes with you. -You were not paddling for the last 45 minutes. You're sittin' there with your fuckin' camera. -All right. Just catch up to them. -Yeah, whatever you want, master. -Hey, hold up, guys. Hold up, guys. Tim can't -- Tim can't keep up with a bunch of ladies. -"Oh, hold up, guys." -We can't help that we're super strong females. -Super strong! -You know what? Fuck you. -All right. Calm down. -No, you know what? -Hey, Daisy. -Hey, what? -How was that bachelor party 3 weeks ago? -The bachelorette party? -Mm-hmm. -It was good. -Yeah? -I mean, lots of penis paraphernalia... -Oh, God, sure. -Which always makes me super uncomfortable. -But it was good -- why? -Uh, Danny had a sleepover party at your place. -Okay. All right. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -With who? -Forget about it, all right? I'm sorry I was mean to you. -Who do you think? -I'm sorry. -I don't know. -Kat. -Hey. How ya doin'? -What? -Are you serious? -What do you mean? -Kathy sl-- Kathy sl-- -Oh, 'cause someone said the K word, so am I serious? -Um, Kathy slept over at our house? -How 'bout we stop ganging up on Daniel and just continue. I'm sorry that I called you a girl as a rower. I'm sorry. -That has nothing to do with this now. -Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. -That's not what I'm talkin' about anymore. -Um, why did Kathy sleep over at our house? And were you with her? -He's... -We went out to celebrate when I closed that apartment. -Yeah. -We got drunk, had to go home early, next morning do the fuckin' signing. -Yeah. -He stays out with her all fuckin' night. She sleeps at his place. He has no problem with that. -Keep it goin'. I'm usin'... This is good for the drama. -Yeah. No. It's always good for you. -Yeah, it is always... -Wipe that fuckin' smirk off... Wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face. -Look at me right now. I'm not fuckin' smirking. -Yo, I'm not even fuckin' around, motherfucker. -Okay. Wait. Wait. -I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. -Daniel, Kathy slept at our house, and you didn't think you needed to tell me that? Right? Am I right? That's what happened? -Yeah. 'Cause he's my best friend. And his girlfriend, like usual, caused a scene and was a drunk, fuckin' bitchy mess. -God, wow. -But you didn't think that it was important to tell me this, that --that his, okay, fine, drunk girlfriend, slept on our couch? -Oh, please. -Wait. Wait. Wait. -This whole relationship... -Wait -- -This whole relationship is much shadier than my relationship was with Kathy. -This is about you and me, buddy. Um, she did sleep on the couch, right? -This is ridiculous. -She slept on the couch, right? -You're a scumbag, you know? -All right. Stop snarling like a fucking animal. Did she sleep on the couch? No. No, she didn't. -Did she sleep in our... -I think we both fuckin' passed out on the bed. Who gives a fuck? -Oh, my God. -Really? -Get that camera... -Yeah, you think that's fuckin' weird 'cause you're a prude. -Turn it the fuck off. -Hey, no, easy. -Are you fucking serious? -You're being a dick. Put the camera down. -All right. You just... -Fuck you, Daniel. -You keep goin'. -Who do you think you fuckin' are? What do you think we're doin' here? We're here because you fuckin' asked us to come. -We're here to fuckin' distract you. -No. You wipe out the smartass fuckin' shit. -There's no smartass shit. We're here... -No, there is fuckin' smartass shit. Brother, I will throw that fuckin' thing in this fuckin' lake right now. -All right. Come on. We're still... -All right. I'll fuckin' go when I wanna fuckin' go. -Wipe the smirk off your fuckin' face. -I'm not smirking. I'm sorry. -And take it easy on these two as well. -Fair enough. -We're here for you, asshole. -All right. -You done? -I'm done. -Good. Let's fucking go. -All right. -Come on, girls. -Fuck it. I'll help you row. I'm sorry, dude. -Dude... -Are we cool? -Just talk about it later, you know? Let me just chill out here. -All right. No doubt. -Just a little longer. Just a little further. -There it is, Turtle Island, right ahead. -So close. -Tim, how long has it been? -So pretty. We're just gonna dock, and we're gonna... -It's been close to 3 hours. -Guys, you're doing great. I really appreciate it. We're almost there. We're almost there. -All right. I can't. Nope. I just... I can't. I'm so tired. -Sweetie, sweetie, it's okay. -Babe, it's straight ahead. -I'm so tired. I'm so cold. We've been out here for, like, 3 hours. -I know. I'm cold too. -I don't want to do this. -I'm cold too. But look, it's right there. -My legs are shaking. I can't hold this oar anymore. -It's right there. -I'm done. No. I'm done. -Come on, Daisy. Daisy, come on, please? Just for once. -Come here. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about earlier. I'm sorry I've been an asshole. I just really wanted to do this show. Come here. Come here. We'll switch. Let's switch. -Let's just... -Switch what? -Switch, all right? We'll switch. -Let's just all take a deep breath and we'll get there. It's okay. -We're right... -What are we switch... -We're so close. -Switch... you -- you and Daisy can switch. If she really wants to, that's fine. I'm sorry. Okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that. -Let's do that. -If we switch, you put down the camera and fuckin' paddle for her. She's tired. -Yeah, of course I'm gonna take the paddle. I'm gonna film -- film the switch, though 'cause I need a little action is all. You know that. -All right. -All right. -All right. Let me... Watch yourself. -Your... -All right. Steady the boat. You cool? -Yeah. I got it. -Just stand up first. -Okay. I'll -- I'll, uh... I got it. Okay. -All right. -And what we'll do is you put one foot in my boat. -Yeah. -You all right? -Yup. Okay, one more foot. -There we go. -Yup. -Everything's fine. -That a girl! -You're good. -You all right? -You're good. Come on in. -Oh... Ah! -Holy shit. -Oh! -You okay? Babe, you all right? -You guys okay? -You all right? -Oh, my God. -You all right? Just --just relax. You're fine. You're fine. -Babe, come here. Come here. Come here. -You're fine. You're fine. -It's fine. It's fine. -You're fine. -You all right? Come here. Hey. Hey. Hey. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. -I swallowed, like... -What's up? Come here, okay? -Oh, my God. -Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm sorry, okay? -Yeah. -I'm sorry about everything. All right. Come on. -Daniel. -Oh, this one just went over. -All right. Here -- here, Dais. -Oh, my God, you guys. I'm... -How --how are you doin'? -I wanna go home. -I know. Gonna get you home. It's gonna be totally fine. Just keep some pressure on it, okay? -Yeah. -Just keep that pressure on it. -I know. I know. You look so cold. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You guys all right? -Yeah. -You need help? You all right? -Yup. -Oh, land, sweet, sweet, land. Oh. Thank you. -Here, take this bag. -Yeah. -Oh, got some of this... in these trees. The woods, Vermont, little daylight left. -Uh... -The adventure officially begins. It was a long trek. -Okay. -Everyone's a little tired, a little wet, a little cranky still. You can see the girls aren't thrilled with Tim. A lot of sides are being taken. -And we'll just have a girls' weekend. -Dais, Dais, you still... We cool? -Oh, yeah. We're super cool. Everything's great, babe. -Come on. -I'm fucking freezing. I'm covered in lake water. And I get to share this tent with you. -Do you want a drink? Let's have some drinks. Hey, Timmy. -I don't know if we brought enough to make me happy. -What? -Try not to get shit all over it. -Try not to get... It doesn't fuckin' matter. It's not set up yet. -Dan, can you just turn the camera off? You're annoying everyone. -Babe, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. What's up? Why are you being so upset? I know we're all a little wet. -Yeah, it's just 'cause I'm cold and I'm wet. It's because ya lied to me, buddy. That's why. -Why? She means nothing. It's crazy. It's Tim's ex-girlfriend. You're fuckin' nuts. You're being crazy. -I'm the one who's crazy? -Kathy's our friend. She was a friend of ours. I mean... -Was, yeah, was. Not anymore. That's for sure. -Okay. -'Cause both of you are apparently liars. But you know what? Why don't you just call her? Why don't you guys have a little sleepover here? I'll go home. I'll kayak my own ass home. Hey, Tim, you wanna help me out here, man? Come on. This is ridiculous. -Look... we're stuck here for the night Let's just try and make the fuckin' best of it. Nobody's thrilled. Hey. -Everyone's a little agitated, all right? -I wonder why. -Okay. It's not all on me. He shouldn't have brought it up. There was a lot of stuff that... He shouldn't have. It was inappropriate. -Mm-kay. Mm-kay. The hood's going up. The angry hood's going up. -Come on. Let's go talk it out. -Guys, go take a walk. And we'll finish this shit, I suppose. Ranger Rick over here's tellin' me how to build a fuckin' tent. -Does she... Do you have cigarettes? -Of course I have cigarettes. -All right. You okay? You're not gonna kill me out there? -I don't know. Let me find my ax. -Okay. -Come on. [ Flicking lighter ] -Really, babe? You're setting up the camera for this? -Thanks. -Just keep exploiting the shit out of us. Here. What? It's not necessary. I'm trying to have a heart-to-heart with my boyfriend. And apparently, the viewers at home need to watch it. God damn it. -So we're not cool? -No, we absolutely are not cool for... On so many different levels, man. First of all, the camera thing. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. -Don't want it right now. Second of all, let's just throw it out there, a chick slept in our bed and you didn't tell me about it. -It wasn't a chick. It was Kathy, first of all. Okay? -Yeah, well fuck Kathy. -She was drunk as shit. -Okay. Why didn't you tell me about it? -Because it would've given more weight to a situation that didn't need more weight. -Okay. -I didn't want her... we're... -So nothing happened? Straight up, nothing happened? -Do you -- do you know how lucky I am to have you? Do you know what it feels like to wake up next to you? Nothing happened? Come on. I put on a fucking show in front of people so I can sell this and I can get us a house. That's all I want to do. -Okay. -You understand? -How would you -- Yeah, I hear you, and that's lovely. But how would you feel if Tim slept in our bed and I didn't tell you about it? Put yourself in my shoes. How would you feel? -I'd feel different because I think he likes you. And I've always felt that way. -Yeah. But I don't like him. And that's all that matters. So baby, I'm just -- I'm just try... I'm sorry. I -- I feel like that girl, like I'm overreacting. -You're not that girl. -I'm going bananas, but... -You're the best girl. -Just... I was just blindsided by the whole thing. -I'm sorry. -And we're in the middle of -- we're in the middle of a fucking lake. And I hear that my boyfriend has secrets. -You shouldn't have heard it. -That's not cool. -He shouldn't have said it. And you shouldn't have heard it. And it wasn't a secret. I tell you everything. -And I tell you everything, so... -I know that. -Okay. -So let's focus on this, okay? -Okay. -We cool? -Yeah, we're cool. I'm just... -What do you want from me? -I just... Sometimes work is number one. -You're number one. You know that. -You swear? -Of course I swear. -'Cause I'm so supportive of you. And you're wonderful at what you do. And I'm so into it.
