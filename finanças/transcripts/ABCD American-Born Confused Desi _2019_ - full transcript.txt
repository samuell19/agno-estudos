Heavy traffic reported ahead. Boss, excuse me, boss. Hey, what is it? What happened to my bank loan, sir? Are you a the CEO of the bank or I am IPL teams owner that I you would be granted the loan as soon as you ask for it? You just joined the channel ten days back. Loan. In two hundred meters exit left. How long? We are here sir, we are here. I don't why that guy is said thirty eight rupees per day is sufficient. And on this sunny day why did they give us this duty. And with the Google maps you are taking me all around in search of Netaji. Hey why did you bring us to dead end? It said in hundred meters turn left sir. And we ended up here. You either listen to Google maps or Shreya Gosla's songs. If you try to listen to both, this how we get lost. Turn the vehicle. In one kilometer at the roundabout take the second exit. Boss! Yes. If you don't mind I would like to say something. Tell me. This song is not sung by Shreya Gosala. Shut up. You don't try to show off your knowledge. You don't know how to take me to the destination but you are able to show off. Move! Continue straight. I will skin you alive, if any other channel fellow reaches before us. It said one kilometer a little while ago right? Did you over shoot? You have reached your destination. Hey, hey, there is the BOARD: Nethaji Nagar. Get off, get off. Just stop a little ahead. Okay. Sir, ready sir. Hey, what ready so fast? Wait for a while guys. My wife is already making a mess that I'm not seen well in TV. Ready. Our Finance Minister Mr. Nagendra supporting the decision of planning 38 rupees per dayare enough for a common man to lead life in India is creating havoc. We will now ask his constituency Netaji Nagar public about what they feel on this. Fast, girls are coming. We shall ask them the questions. Hey, camera Camera come on here. I am Netaji Nagar Celebrity, ask me answer. Ready? Ready. Madam, your MLA says 38 rupees a day are enough for a common man to live. What's your response about this? Pension, sir? It isn't coming, will you give? Nagendra doesn't say anything just like that. We have full confidence on him. Hey cut it, cut it. Who the man carrying the life burden every second will know the value of problems and about the expenses. When we think, what's wrong in what he said? We should make it a controversy. Who'd watch if we say like this? One should scold. Hey, which idiot said that? Hello boss, 30 rupees for the 90 a night and the stuff costs 10 rupees. It totals to 40 rupees. If that is over in the night, what about the morning? Hey, you shouldn't show all these in camera. No idea about him, but I'll definitely vote if his son contests the election. Why so? Yes, he looks so handsome. Oh, is she that type? Do you know that everything has a rate here? Our politicians have made this a habit. Hey, give 500. I spend 50 rupees daily for just my leaves. Leaving aside 38 or 50, it is better that we all bring down our expenses. Scold well. If so, can't we say? Hey, that's given to me. Come on, scold guys. Hey, they gave me. Hey, they gave it to me. You have seen it, right Kishore? Mr. Nagendra's fans and the public are fighting due to the 38 rupees issue. Looking it this, I feel the issue doesn't seem to settle. Though I got this shot directly, indirectly we can understand that they are opposing the statement of Mr Nagendra. Yesterday you charged me another rate. Madam, give two 'Water' packets. It's too hot. Netaji Nagar public is asking, “what would Mr. Nagendra moving in. AC cars know about the problems of common man? Hello, what is this coming to our area? Which channel? Who are you? Our brother What in our brother's area? Hey, break the camera. Hey, catch them, catch. When we are trying to bring out the inner feeling of public from third eye channel, Nagendra's followers are attacking on us. We shall meet again if alive. Over to studio. Sir, sir. What? You forgot to wear pants sir. Remove yours and give. Come on remove yours and give. News reader's job isn't with the dress below table, but with news above the table. Are the legs being seen when wide angle is put? Won't you check the framing? Will you place the camera here? Will you place it here? No hierarchy nothing, everyone starts giving advice. Mr. Niranjan, good morning. Good morning. If you throw those papers here, I'll read news, take my salary and go. Sorry sir, Story one sir. Assam polling in confusion. Taapsee states her concentration is only towards the B grade (BOOTHU) films. What? What is this? Assam polling booth in confusion full stop. Taapsee states her concentration is only towards the films. Won't you put these full stops and commas? Don't you know the basic punctuation? Not just to have a drink once the time is up sir. You should know even to put commas in timing. No idea how and why are few people born. When said all get angry and hurt. Yeah, story two sir! Come on throw Mr. Niranjan, throw something here. Take. Will Bharat dashing with 14 medals stop in Super wealth games? Not this colloquial language sir, when we have such a sweet and great Telugu language, it's written here in this dirty language. See now, my whole mood is spoilt and that reflection is visible over my face. Sir, sir. Breaking news sir, it seems heart attack for Finance Minister. Is he dead? No Sir. Great, 24 hours now All 24 news channels stand outside that hospital. My bad luck sir, come on take. State Finance Minister Nagendra collapsed with heart attack in the state office at Delhi. Even half an hour before getting the heart attack, he spoke with press and supported the statement of planning commission that 38 rupees per days is enough for a common man to live in India. Protests have started from his own party office with that. Doctors opine that this pressure maybe the reason for his heart attack. Definitely sir. Good evening sir. Good evening sister. Yeah give me. Thank you. Shall I put the news sir? We can watch news but it's tough to see when we become the news. No need dear. Okay sir. My PA Chakravarthy will be there outside. Ask him to come inside. Okay sir. Sir. What's the situation, Chakravarthy? Why do you ask slowly about what, sir? You have swept aside the matter to turn into a controversy with your idea of heart attack sir. Your sympathy is grown in the public. All our cadre are into prayers, programs in TVs, Greetings, bouquets etc., for your health. My mind is going blank looking at your following sir. Then, this is the correct time to enter my son into politics. That's how am rolling. I live life like a star. “I'm gonna fly up far, Feeling high so fly,” “Cause I'm living like a Rockstar.” A, B, C, D. "American Born Confused Desi" “What I do, or what I don't” “Won't matter with the women I roll,” “Cause they feeling so high and fly,” “Say my name, Say my name, what?” A, B, C, D. "American Born Confused Desi." A, B, C, D. "American Born Confused Desi" “I've got my wings, I'm gonna spread them till I stop no fly” “I send my love to the moon and back, watch you scream” “watch you dance, watch you shake,” “Watch you make a boom,” “Tonight ain't over cause I make the rhythm Blow Blow”. Why don't you come to my mom's marriage. Yo Basha I'll call you back. Let's Bounce. Where's Jessica, bro? We broke up. You broke up, why? I don't feel it, man. I'm not getting that girlfriend feel. What type of a girl do you need for getting that sort of a feel, brother? I don't know what type of a girl, but I want magic. I want Magic in Love. I don't find it with Jessica. That's why we broke up. Magic! It will come. Bhasha let's go. The name American Born Confused Desi hasn't just come so. They'd have given seeing a guy like you. Good Morning sir. Good Morning Mr Karthik. You said to submit those Chicago branch project files, are they ready? It's done sir, almost 90% is over. I believe only in two numbers, zero and hundred. 100 if the work is done, else zero. Yes sir. Don't come up with numbers in between. Come up with your work. Okay sir. Those documents should be with me in the next two hours. Okay? Sure sir. This is the high way this is a five star resort. And the entire project is a golf course. We are looking forward to work with you. Thank you. Sir, your son Avi's bills. Twenty thousand Dollars in one month? Does he know the value of money, Murthy? Coming with a dream to achieve something 25 years back, with a thought not just to develop but should give work to a few, I came to this stage saving every Dollar. But he is becoming like this. How to change him, Murthy? Sir, we may see Dollar rate falling to Rupee rate. But it's impossible for Avi sir to change. Call him once and ask where is he? "American Born Confused Desi." "American Born Confused Desi." Mom! Hey mom! Good morning. What do you have for breakfast? Mom I'm talking to you. You should talk in Telugu language only at home. Huh. How does the language matter? You understand what I'm talking, right? Whatever language you talk outside, you should talk in Telugu at home with mom. Mother, I'm hungry, will you serve me food? Yeah! That sounds good? See, it's so good. Why don't you too talk in Telugu like Basha, son? Basha's Telugu Damn. What, Telugu of your niece? It isn't so easy to shorten the name Bala Shanmugam as Basha, for him to talk in Telugu. His Telugu is dead as he couldn't listen and bear with his Tamil accent Telugu. Drink this before having breakfast. What's this? You drank in the night, right? For the body not to dehydrate, this will rehydrate the body. Do one thing Mix and give a peg too and they'd give you best mother award. Stop it. When would kids enjoy if not at this age? They'll understand as they grow. Parenting style has changed, we should get updated. Okay It seems you broke up with that white girl? What? Who your agent Basha said that? What if whoever tells me, son? You broke up and that's enough. Mom, I broke up. Why so much of happiness for you when I break up? What if not, son? I've been saying white girls won't set for you and the same has happened. Keep watching and I'd look for a good Telugu girl and get you married. Mom, you always say about Telugu, India and culture. Aren't there any other topics for you than these? Yes yes Next topic is about the spending by you. 20,000 Dollars means approximately 1.5 Million in Indian currency, that means a family of four can happily live for five years. But that is your monthly spend. Do you have any idea how are you living, Avi? No dad will feel happy when scolding the son, Avi. But you should know the value of money and life. Not just my wealth but should share even my character as a son. You forgot this. Hey. What if not dad? As your father was a farmer, you worked hard and grew in life from childhood. But me My dad is a Millionaire. Dad, why did you work so hard and do all this? So that I can live a comfortable and rich life I'm leading that same, right? Dad, you know why are you getting anger? Do you know why you are angry? You are just jealous as I'm enjoying my life with your money in a way you can't enjoy life. You are just jealous. Be happy for your son, dad. Most importantly thank you for everything. Love you dad. Hey. You are leaving for Melbourne in few days, right? Spend some time with us. Even my friends are exactly saying the same. Got to go dad, bye. Hey bro. What's up, man? Hey Avi, careful son. Aunt, nothing will happen to Avi when this Basha is there. How did I tell? Hey I'm saying to be careful from you. Insult, insult and an insult! Come on let's go. Hello, hello. Hey, you just broke up right? Do we need this now? Even if he's calm, her looks don't seem to let him be quiet. His look itself is bad. All the best. Hey bro look He is dancing with ikkeeyaa. You bloody! How dare you touch my girl friend. What's your problem? Thank you. Hey, it's more than 25 years after I came to USA. But I never stepped into Police station and this is the first time because of you. You should be ashamed. Hey! You better come out man. I am gonna take him down. You mess with my girlfriend. I am not gonna leave you. Get out. Gayatri. I am gonna take you down. Come out man, come out man. Hey Avi back. Leave me leave me. I wanna kill him. I wanna kill him.

Take that and break. Go. Sir, dad asked you to meet in the evening. What have you newly complained now? I've not said anything, sir. Hey dad, you called for me? Yeah Avi, I need to discuss a small matter with you. Avi, you aren't any kid. We can't sit all the 24 hours thinking about your security. They may attack you anywhere and anytime now. Dad, but those guys were wrong. You are anyways joining in Melbourne University in the next one month. For us not to have any tension it's good for you and Basha go on India trip for a month, enjoy happily and leave directly to Melbourne from there. By that time everything will settle down here. Dad, India? What's there in India, Dad? Except population and pollution! Bad idea dad, bad idea. Shut up Avi, don't forget that your parents are from India. Remember the base for each of your enjoyment today comes from there. What's dad, bro? He is saying to go to India. Go to India, who will go there? But still to be in India for 14 days without Buffalo wild wings, 'Burger' and 'Soda'! No, can't do it bro, can't do it. India is a bad idea bro. Bad? That means. No. What happened? It has mayonnaise in it. How many times did I say that I don't like ranch? Hey, I told that to the burger guy. But he. What are you going to do? What, what, hey hello! You gonna throw that there? That's a three pointer bro, you can't do it. Bet? 50 Dollars. Make it 100. Your wish. Oh my gosh! 100 Dollars. Hey take it easy. Give me. He can't leave money take it. Bro, like every human born has a talent within, every country on the map has a matter. We shall grab that. Not convinced bro. Yes, look here British salary, American house, Italian food and Indian girls. A guy said its heaven to have all the four. Who said it? He is Rutherford. Who is he? Do we need who he is, now? Matter is good and just take it, that's all. What should I say now? Yes, look there wherever we see, there are just two colours, over white and dull black. But India isn't so. Variety of colours, variety of girls etc., Look here, why don't you believe? Wow. Look here, see how cute is she - Hey, she's film actor Kajal right? Yes She too stays in India, right? That's it, right? Do we get such cute girls? You'll get a girl cuter than her. Trust me. What, won't you believe? It's a promise on me, no promise on you. Hey. Shut up. Huh Damn, is it sure? Sure. Okay, let's go to India. Yes! When you said, I'd see going ahead I didn't understand sir. Hats off for your fore sight sir, you're bringing in Bhargav sir at the correct time. Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! Long live, Bhargav Babu! How do you support your statement that 38 rupees a day is enough for a common man to live? Dad said if decided one can adjust and live in 38 rupees approximately, but never insulted him. It is not good for you to use what he used as an example in flow, to gain your TRPs. The public knows what he is and what he did to them from 30 years. Your opposition says what'd you know about politics here when you're into business at Dubai. They are correct, I don't know politics. I came to just serve the people who gave us so much. Thank you. Sir, sir. Sir, sir. Greetings sir. Nagendra! You're seen more on TV and papers these days than in physical, what's the matter? Hello sir. Not just your planning commission issue but issue of that Chemical Factory at your Netaji Nagar is slowly and silently spreading. What shall we do? We gave 300 Millions as party fund for last elections and they're asking for 500 Millions this time. We can pay party fund when you let us run such factories, right sir? I saw as a kid long back, no change at all. He's taking care of the power project in Dubai. I'm also growing old and wish to bring him in politics. Are the troubles we faced till date not enough? Should even our children face them? Politics is there right in our blood. I came prepared for everything sir. Keep watching, I'll win this election with a record majority. Oh! Is it. We just gave the ticket and you talk records and majorities. Your son doesn't look to stop with MLA post. Yes sir, you said the word of my mouth. If you can somehow get the Finance Ministry I handled for so long to my son. Finance? Giving a Ministry isn't as easy as to give MLA ticket. There are already so many pressures behind me, they are torturing me. Sir, you're like my father and you should somehow look into this. Okay, ask your son to first get into that public and get some popularity. Okay sir. Though he has no experience, we can say about popularity and put his name at least in the list. Okay sir. Okay, ask him to be on that job first. See you. See you. Look Bhargava, come here once. To get popularity doesn't mean to get hailed having few pimps around you. Public doesn't believe if you go so in neat dress and costly watches and say to do this and that. You should move in them, with them and make them believe that you are their man, understood? Such a long and tiring journey bro. Yeah, yeah, very tired. Yes, it's like we got an energy right? Yeah, I can feel positive vibes on our trip. Yes, Incredible India. Hello, sir. Give him to luggage. Sorry sir, I'm late. Oh, he came for them. This is India, right they don't know who we are manage like that. Are you Avi and Basha? Yeah. Then please come. Hello. I'll get. What's this? Dollar! One Dollar of ours is 70 rupees here. That means we can enjoy 70 times more than there. Yes. What bro why did you bring a cheap car like Audi? Hello brother, that isn't ours but this is ours. Oh no! What the hell? Is this our car? Dude, this Murthy man! Bloody, I'm gonna call him right now. Bro, bro. Leave it. Already we are tired. Just to the hotel and we'll adjust, come on. Hey, does the car have an engine or are you pushing it with your feet? Wow, nice roads bro. Surprising. I thought India was bad. It developed a lot bro. Oh God! Idiot. Nice apartment, man. It looks nice, but we aren't staying here. Come let's go. Then, why did you stop the car here? Cars won't come to the place we go to. Just will go by walk, Let's go. What? Chemical factor should be removed. Our health is our right. Government should come down. Chemical factor should be removed. He's coming drunk every day. He said no money for vegetables. But he drink every day in the Morning. What should I say? Watch out, people. How long should go. Oh no! Damn, what's this? If you close your nose so for some more time, not the foul smell but your life will be gone. Dung here and cooking beside that are common here. All that had to be in the zoo is moving on the road.

Poor guys, hope you don't know that. Hello, do you know whom are you talking to? Do you know where are we from? Any problem sir? We came from America on a trip. We need a suite room. When asked whether available, he is speaking so without respect. Kamalakar, is the suite room booked? I mean, I thought they may need a normal room sir. That means, you imagined? Sorry for the inconvenience sir, we have suite room. How many days are you going to stay sir? Yes. We will stay here for one month. And that too if your treatment is good.

What ACP sir, you said something confidential to be discussed? No problem, say it. Better if you can think of some solution about that Chemical Factory issue sir. They are into rally's and hunger protests, awareness in public is growing sir. Intelligence report says this will be coming onto your neck during the elections time, sir. When they have a life threat from Chemical Factory, they fast for us instead of hunger strikes? You name it again as Intelligence, say something new ACP. People are very good ACP. If they don't get water, if their health isn't well, have no job, when in troubles, they go to the temple and say that to God but would never come to MLA or MP. More than what we did in five years, they think about how much we gave for every election once in five years. We shouldn't seriously think about their problems, which they never take seriously. Now my target is money for elections. I don't care about their protests and other issues. What else, ACP? I came to say the same sir, see you now sir. ACP ask your intelligence if possible about how much to give per vote to win and my job gets easy. Dude he stop. Did he stop? Thank you. Hey, stop man stop. Hey, are you gone blind with money?

I doubt whether he'd be alive till Ambulance is here or not. No Ambulance, call the cops. Yes cops, yes. Please sir, please. Please, why Police and all now? It'll be a problem. It should be a case, you call Police, Police. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please sir, please! We shall settle if required. Settle, what settle? That is you know, some amount. Are you trying to give me a bribe? Is it a bribe for everything in India? Why should you think so? Why not think it as money for treatment? You give me money? Huh, you give me money? Hey. How much will you give? Rs. 3000. Oh no! Brain hemorrhage bro. Oh my God, brain hemorrhage! Oh no! Okay, okay! 4000, I'll give 4000 okay? 4000? No, no Internal bleeding. American body madam. Please sir, I have only 5000 with me. I don't have more than that. How? You say Okay? Look, you can't buy our pain with money. As we are decent boys and to close the issue, we are taking money. Give it. Okay, thank you. One second. Go, go, go. What's up bro? What? You said I can't manage Desi girls? You saw that, 80 Dollars bro. 80 Dollars bro!

Dad, listen first to what I say. I don't have a balance if I want to call and talk to you. I understood the value of money. I also understood the life value. I'll listen to whatever you say from now. I will do my MBA dad I too thought the same, son. That's why I have even taken MBA admissions to you and Basha. Huh Thanks. MBA Is it London school of economics or Melbourne University as we thought? LSE is really hard to get into. But if we try, we can. Hey Avi, as you think, I didn't take admission at London or Melbourne but in India. What India? Hey Avi, there isn't a better place than India for studying. See, for you to return back to US again, you've to finish MBA and come. I took admission for you in Nava Bharat group of Institution and made all the arrangements. Remember one more thing, I'll send the monthly amount of 5000 rupees as said, only if the attendance is good. Dad, you don't feel great like Chiranjeevi from Swayamkrishi film. Don't think I'll change if pushed into troubles. I'm born rich, grew rich and will live as rich. I'm not going to any college in India. Bye. Hey. Gone all gone. 5000 it seems and should do MBA in India only, it seem What a damn! Damn! Hey, why are throwing such a costly phone over the ground? Is your mind gone or what? Hey, shut up Get out. Hey dude, by sharing drink we get a kick when problem is shared you get solution. When I use my hand you get pain. Oh no! Don't get angry dude, say your story and I'd decide the climax I need three Lakhs rupees, will you give? Three Lakhs, for what bro? Why do you need reasons, will you give? I can't give you but I can make someone else lend. You? Oh God, you are not knowing where all are my towers are.

Matter is, I and Basha are missing our parents a lot. That's why, we wanted to visit America and see them once. Move dude, we shall go to airport, buy tickets. Hello, back, back what, will you go to America with this money? Oh my Goddess Peddamma. Why? These are fake notes. Fake! What? Fake notes? What's that?

Come to the house tomorrow for once, let's talk. Your records Hello Sir. Principal should be strict with students and in favour to the Management. What are you in favour of students and strict with management? Why do you say so Sir? Elections are nearing. I said to collect the pending fees and how far has that come? We are collecting Sir. When now? Is it after the elections? I mean, we sent circulars and are putting pressure Sir I don't care whether you send circulars or send them out when fees are not paid. I want all the fees to be collected by the 25th of this month. Okay Sir. If you don't think about this, I'll have to think about you. I understood, sir. What do you understand seeing all this bro? If there is a good Western toilet here, there'd be a pleasure going out, upload full and then download coming here. Aravind Prasad, Bala Shanmugam, MBA Finance. Irrespective of Finance, Marketing, Engineering or Pharmacy, Semester fee of every course should be collected by the 25th. Understood? I understand bro, but what's 5000 for both per month? It's just 70 Dollars, to live here even 5000 rupees each wouldn't be enough. Why are you surprised saying 5000? Yes, 5000! Let's give 5000 per vote. Poor guys, it's their pocket money once in 5 years and giving less won't look good. Oh, pocket money! Have you ever given me a 100 saying I'd have a need and to take it? Bro, full body pains and I got bashed up well. Good that I get 500 rupees for evening drink, I mean Medicine. Please dude, my dear please. Days to beg saying please are gone, Chakravarthy. Everything now is to cleverly Grab. Don't pull dude, leave. We don't have money at all, it'd get torn. Hey! Sorry bro. Idiot. You don't talk like an idiot. Who has guts to put a hold to our majority in our constituency opposing us? University of Melbourne. Dude, you shut up. It's all because of you. You got excited saying Indian girls, right? Move now. Dear students, two new students are going to join in our class today. Though they are born and brought up in America, just with an interest to study in India they are joining in our college in NRI quota. So, you have to be very supportive and friendly with them. Okay. Why are you waiting outside Come in. Guys, he is Aravind. Hi guys. And he is Balashanmugam. Guys, make yourself comfortable. Sure. Whatever problems you have, say with me. Yes, already you've missed two weeks classes. But you have to catch up very fast. Okay. Neha. Oh no, why did I get booked so? Yes Sir. Look free time daily and explain to them the syllabus completed. And keep in touch with them. Okay Sir. Guys. Aravind. Aravind. Mr. Aravind. Sir said, right? What did he say? I should say the missed classes, right? Will you say right away? Not now, but daily one hour before the college or after college would be enough. Okay. Aravind. To communicate anything, your number? My what? Your number. She is asking me for my number bro. Didn't I say to you before? Life is too short and the world is too small. I and you may face each other tomorrow and then you may ask for my number. Did you listen? See, it's happening. Okay then, get the classes from someone else. I'll talk to Sir. Hello. Hello, I'm not like you. When someone asks for the number I'll give. Please note it down. Say 910097019 Okay. Okay, what did you say was your name? Nitya or Nethra? Don't know. It's Neha. Neha. And by the way, you can call me Avi. Hey, get up. Its eight dude. Where? Neha said to take the class and asked to come, right? Oh! So you have to learn all the missed classes now, complete MBA, achieve a gold medal, wear a waste cap, worn out coat, take a photo and go back to the US? Hey, Basha here! I know well about why you're going. You go on that job. I'll sleep and think about how to go back to the US. Do your own job. Oh God! Neha! Sorry, Neha! Got up early by 6 and by the time I went to temple in the traffic and came back, I got late. 8'O clock means you should be here sharp by 8 from tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll say to Sir. Oh, will you call even him from tomorrow? These silly jokes aren't required. So, coming to today's topic, basically demand and elasticity that means Consumers are more responsive to the variable. In to the organisation. Explain to the organisation. Hello, you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Then say, what I explained so far. Yes. You were talking about the socio-economic problems of India. The root cause of these problems is the beautiful blue dress. No, no, that, that the blueprint and that the. The two disparities decrease peoples increase earrings no, no earnings. The GDP has slowed down right now because of the black money and there is there is a stagnation. Stagnation in the economy because of the black money reserves. And it's the responsibility of the government, for the upliftment of these lips, no, no upliftment of the poor. Listen, please pay attention. Teaching you isn't any fun for me. Sir asked and that's why I'm teaching. Next topic. You still didn't leave? You said class after college, right? I'm thus waiting. Oh God, I'm so sorry. I forgot. I'd been to the hostel when Santhi called for a birthday. It's already late, shall we sit tomorrow? Okay. Avi, how will you go? By walk. By walk, what's that? Busses will follow timings, right? It's gone by 4:30. Next bus is somewhere at 8 or 8:30, maybe longer. I will walk it up. Where do you stay? Stop, stop, right here. Avi. Avi. As it was just raining, I took out the clothes as they'd get wet. Is it, you are taking so much care about me. Thank you It's Okay, dear. Yes, come. This is the house I stay. They said you came from the US and you staying here? Dad. The first hero for everyone in life, but the only villain I have in my life is my dad. My dad is crazy about money. He used to always go out of home saying to earn money. No time to feed his son making him sit beside but had no time even to kiss his son. Was he at least good to my mom? No, he always came home drunk and and then. Good night. Amongst these conditions at home, just education became my relief. That's why, I used to spend more time in college. When Baba said to be useful for all, my dad understood as not to do any help without a profit. That's why I understood the problems of the poor and decided to be one of them. I fought with blacks in America. Fought for blacks in America and went to jail. My dad didn't come even to get me a bail thinking it's a waste of money. Seeing my dad so from childhood, I got vexed up with the money. After coming to America from India, my dad became mad for money. That's why, I decided to move from there to here. I and my cousin leaving that country, Millions of wealth, comforts wished to stand by ourselves, joined MBA and are leading happy normal life amongst the common men. Oh God! That's very inspiring. You decided to stand on your own without depending on parents and I really appreciate you. Thank you. At first, when I came from the US wanted to make friendship with you as I knew none and asked for your number, but you. I said so not knowing about you. It's enough that you know all these are simple mischief in this age but not as bad as you thought I'm really sorry about that. No, that's okay. Okay then, bye. Bye. Avi. Friends? Friends? Yes, of course. Okay then, bye. Bye. Hey, what's this dude? Baba said no mistake to say even 10 lies to make a girl flat dude. What, Baba? Detailed quantification of resource requirements that are expected for a given time. Remember this is a very important topic. First, you note down this table. In this table, you can see all the expenses that are done by the company for material or people so. He's calling. Operating expenses statement. Let's see, accounts or payable. Excuse me, Sir. Yes, come in. Circular Sir. Swathi. Sir. You go urgently to the Administrative department. So, resource requirements are Capital, material or people. Sir. Why are you still standing here, if not to take my job away? They'd remove your name from register saying that you haven't paid your fees by the 25th. You won't get the hall ticket and you can't write exams. Please go. Sir, please give me one week time. I'll definitely pay Sir. It was better if you had cried so at your house in advance. What can I do when you cry coming here? This is Management's decision. Strict orders are given not to allow any students who don't pay fees to write the exams. I can't do anything if you cry or do anything. Please go. Yes! 5000 got credited, bro. Yes. Bro. And operation course. So it may be thought of an action plan. A budget helps allocate resources, evaluate performance, is an essential part of a business plan. When starting a new business. Once a business is established. Budgeting becomes a regular task. Swathi, what happened? Swathi. What happened? Normally occurs on a quarterly and annual basis. Dude! Just one peg and that's all. Otherwise, it crosses our budget. Yes correct, correct. One more Sir? One more. What now? We got the idea not to drink above our budget, that means we are changing. We are changing. You are changing Sir. Yeah! As Obama said change is good. To change is good. Yes drink, come on drink. Change is good, bro. Correct bro, but you did not change in regards with Neha. Suppose. Silence! Yes Neha, Neha. I and Basha are in combine studies. What? Is it! I'm just coming. What Neha again, dude? Won't you change at all? Hey, Neha's best friend Swathi is there, right? She is ranker dude! It seems they removed her from College as she didn't pay the fees. She committed suicide. I'm going. Pay the bill and come immediately. We are at the hospital bro. The girl is safe and we'll say something when the press is here and come back. Okay, Chakravarthy will be coming. Say that we'll bear her hospital expenses and to pay her total MBA fees and compromise so that the news doesn't come out. I'll take care of the rest. Okay bro. Forget everything right here and don't talk to anyone outside, okay? What work do you have here? Why do you care? When our College girl is into problems, instead of fighting about that have you come here to support him? Look Neha, great people are there to take care of the good and bad of College. You go and look into your work. Who are those great people? Those who put a deadline to debar if the fees aren't paid? Those who sent you to console after everything is over? Hey, I won't stay quiet if you say another word about bro. You are habituated to the money and drink he gives. And that's why you support him. Why should we support? It's become an issue now and thus they came down. What about the other students who can't pay the fees? I'm saying brother will take care of all these, right? Student Union council has decided to settle this issue right here. No need of any Union to poke their nose into this. All the students will do a strike questioning the Management about this. Strike? For what, her mom already took the money and is compromised. Aunt. When money is asked, they say to die and cry now when given. They don't know the value of money but come forward to give speeches. Excuse me. What did you say? We don't know the value of money? Hey ABCD, you are not from here. It isn't good for you to unnecessarily poke your nose into this. Who cares about from where dude? Money is money and money for all. What do you know about money's value when you paid Millions. And joined in NRI quota? Only we know the value of money. We thinking always about the toothpaste used by squeezing out from the time we wake up till the night we grab and cover the blanket hich isn't enough for sleeping. Only we know the value of money. Do you want to know how? For the breakfast done to break 8 hours of fasting, after eating 4 'Idli' for 20 rupees, though we feel stomach will fill if two more 'Idlis' are eaten, we kill the hunger and save money. As it costs 12 rupees if two tea is ordered, we order one tea for 6 rupees, share adjusting that sharing is caring in friendship. After coming to the bus stop, even when all the sharing autos are empty, we feel why to waste 15 rupees when we have our RTC and wait. As it costs 3 rupees more in Metro, we wait for the shabby bus with no place even to stand, Push and get pushed and come to the College. After coming to the College, with the money saved at breakfast in the morning, we eat a plate of meals each in the canteen and have two 'Chapatis' each in the night. At times, we think 70 rupees for All out and 100 rupees for power bill are to be spent extra and sleep on the terrace in open. And finally 30 rupees for toothpaste, 40 rupees for detergent, 60 rupees for soap and 200 for mobile recharge. If we go on saying so, 5000 per month which means 83 rupees each. If not us counting every rupee and live to know the value of money, will you guys know it? You bloody douchebag! What are you blabbering in English. If you put hand and if my shirt tears, I lose 200 rupees. And if I raise my hand and when your bones break you lose 2000 rupees, is it required? Let's bring down the expenses and that is good for all. Hey idiot, what are you overacting? Hey stop. It's a problem for us if the issue becomes big. Let's go. Come. Let's go meet Swathi. NRI boy leading a normal life with 83 rupees per day leaving his Billions of properties. 25 Year old NRI student doing MBA from local Nava Bharat College is catching up all eyes with his ideals. Aravind son of a big businessman settled in America and his cousin let go their Billions of properties and luxurious lives in America and came down to India for knowing their roots and spending just 83 rupees a day and are leading a very normal life. We request the present generation youth in dreams to lead rich lives to change be seeing them. Sir, they are here. You did a great thing and why are you hiding like you did something wrong? Please. Thank you. Our College has got a good name as you're studying here. We are proud of you, guys Thank you, Sir, thank you. Bro, that was great bro. Hey bro, what's up man? Oh, thank you. Wait, wait! You owe me a party. Party, for what? After you spoke so that day, Neha explained it all about why you came to India and why you're leading such lives. Oh, did she say? I said the same matter to my uncle in media and he wrote the news about you like an article. Oh, is this the girl? Oh, that's the matter. Thank you, thank you, thanks a lot Thank you. Good morning Sir. It's an honor and prestigious to be here in your show. Don't think the questions would be simple by pleasing me so.

The people who became overnight celebrities with their lifestyle, Mr. Aravind and Bala Shanmugam alias Basha. Welcome to my show. Oh, thank you, Sir. Give it to me. Aravind, what's your age? That means you were in America for 25 years, you ate in America and roamed around in America. Then, why did you suddenly feel to let go all your wealth and come, like never before in these 25 years? I want an answer Sir you are on live. Come on tell me Sir, you are on live. Ba. Ba. Baba. Baba, you mean Rajinikanth Baba? No. Baba. Baba. Baba. So, Baba came in a dream one day and said, "Look Aravind, none of these wealth, girls or the cars are permanent." He said not even one Dollar will follow me when I'm gone. He preached real happiness is to be in a simple life among all and to help a few. So, as his follower, I followed him and came down like this to India. Oh! So, you are Baba devotee now. I mean followers. Yeah. Okay, what if Baba appears suddenly and gives you 10 Million rupees? As of now, right now. What's that question, Sir? Take that Million and immediately to America. Hey, hey, hey. What? Basha was saying something. Come on tell me. Bank of America. What? That isn't America Bank dude, Bank of America.

BHARGAV MIXING INTO THE COMMON PUBLIC RIGHT NOW) (AND EATING AT THE ROADSIDE CARTS NOW, DEEPTHI.) (HE CAME HERE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF NETHAJI NAGAR PUBLIC) We know that Bhargav is standing first in the Youth Icon contest. Also as the elections are nearing up, this tour has gained an importance. Give water. Sir. Bro, we got popularity by luck till now Hi. But not so from now, we should go ahead all over with a plan and strategy. We should catch the eyes of the public. Then our popularity increases and we will get more votes in the Youth Icon Contest. We shall be on that job from today, okay? Okay. Deal? "If you and your deeds are liked, they'd carry you with high ratings." "They won't give you a time even to eat with a tight schedule of selfies." "You shall enhance this name and fame going ahead." "You should enhance when all this craze and public are around us." "Come on dude, whole media should go crazy about us." "Hey dude, this should be the Wikipedia." "He's become an overnight celebrity" "and celebration has started in his life." Avi Sir, Avi Sir, salutes. Hello. Hello grandpa, why did you come here? You should somehow save us, son? Me? You know it all, they are leaving all waste from Chemical Factory into the river. Kidneys of our kids are spoiling right in childhood by drinking that water and we have back pain problems. We've been screaming to close that down from the past four years. Neither the Government nor the opposition is caring about this. While we were waiting for the person to help us, you came at the right time. What can I do, grandpa? Only you can do it, son. If a guy like you supports our hunger strike tomorrow, all would talk about our protest. Then, even the Government would come down. We can't stay here and can't live by going elsewhere. We came with confidence on you, son. Okay. Actually, we have another program committed for these two days. So, maybe we can't come. Sorry. You should come somehow, Sir. We will all be waiting for you. Uncle. Uncle, uncle you should come for sure. Please. Chemical Factory. Should be closed. Government not responding about problems. Down, down. Chemical Factory. Should be closed. Government not responding about problems. Down, down (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) (SLOGANS REPEAT) Sir Tell me I'm at the Chemical Factory Sir. Many people gathered this time. I don't understand what to do. This isn't the first time that they are doing so. You know well about how to clear them all. Correct Sir, I wouldn't have called have in general. But that NRI Aravind came this time in their support. Brother. Look at there. We are now seeing NRIs Avi and Basha sitting in the hunger strike in support to the slum people. Government not responding about problems Down, down. Hey dude, come sit. Hey, I thought you won't come but you've arrived greatly. Is everything fine? It'd be great now. These just passing statements opposing the Government policies till date are now taking part directly in the protest being done opposing the. Government can be said as a sensation. Come on, let's know all the details now going to them. Hey Avi, is this strike and all required now? Hey, by doing so our votes increase in the contest. Even our slum people's problem will be solved. Do what I said you first. Down, down. One minute. Aravind please. Unresponsive government! Down, down! You came to these poor people. Are you supporting their fight? What for the poor people, Sir? Poor is not poor without the poor. I'm the poor. I'm for the poor, I'm for the poor. I'm the poor, I'm the Basha. We haven't come as they are poor people or that they are from our slum. We came as we know the intensity in their problem. We won't move from here unless we find a solution for this. Come on folks. It'll be a problem for us to do lathi charge without a reason Sir. Reason (SLOGANS REPEAT) Hey Aravind, come here. Unresponsive government! Down, down! Chemical factory! Should be removed! Stop, stop. What idiot, came with this labor batch? Is it a build up in front of the media? I'm giving you half an hour time. Remove these tents and leave from here. Clear everyone, make it fast. Hello Sir, you are saying to clear even when we have the Police permission. Who called you? How much did they give? What and with whom are you talking, idiot? Hey Avi! This isn't legal Sir. I'm gonna call my lawyer. Call idiot, call. Charge. Sir, please sir stop. Stop. Please sir stop. Sir, Grandpa, Granny. Granny. Grandpa, Grandpa, As the Police did lathi charge on on the slum people who were protesting against the Chemical Factory in peace, the strike is turned into havoc. Avi? Slum public is into a fire in regards to the attack and arrest of Avi and Basha. Votes for Avi unexpectedly are growing heavily in the Youth Icon Contest after the arrest. Aravind in the third position crossed Vaishnavi Krishna and is into the second position. He's born in a Billionaire's family but thought to live as a common man. He's born far away in America and came to India searching for his roots. His sympathy on the society and the problems around him turned into a curse and led to his arrest. He is none other than Aravind Prasad. This guy seems to get very popular with this now Sir. He looks to even win as the Youth Icon too, Sir. We should know how to win even after losing and that is politics. We did a mistake dude. I didn't expect this to happen. No idea how is poor Deevena. Grandpa and granny. Oh, shut up Avi. We had been to the strike just to win votes in Youth Icon contest. Don't feel like Mahatma Gandhi saying whether the kid is fine or granny is fine. Because of you, we came from the US jail to India Jail now. Hey, we both did this planning together right? Why do you now talk like it's just my mistake alone? Okay, you say man. You say what to do next and we shall do the same. So Mr. Youth Icon, advance congratulations. You are going to win Sakshi Youth Icon Contest, internal information. Tomorrow is the announcement. Once the event is over, I'll send you both to America in business class with my own money. Thank you. But, after one month. What you need to do for this one month is, should be with me in my election campaign and talk great about me. Not just that, on the Youth Icon stage you should say I am your inspiration. You can go back to America only when you do as I said. What if I don't say? There's another plan for that. Sir. FIR copy of your arrest in the US, real truth why you both came to India, your passports seized for not paying the hotel bills evidence that you tried to exchange fake notes in your same area. When I show all these to the public, the public who clapped till date will hit you with slippers. I know you'll do as I said. You are clever, right? He'll say, Sir, he'll definitely say. Hey Basha. We don't have a choice. So, deal. Like every year, the stage is ready for the Youth Icon Award felicitation. Let's now watch the award ceremony in live. And now is the time to announce the winner of Sakshi TV's Youth Icon of the year award. It's none other than Mr. Aravind Prasad. That God himself is saying that no light will come into our lives, why do we need these worships now? Saying so, how can we be without lighting the lamp at God? Bro. And now Sakshi group CEO will be presenting the award of the. Youth Icon of the year to Mr. Arvind Prasad. My man. Congrats and the stage is all yours. Aravind Prasad, Youth icon! It gives a kick just by listening to it boss. Born somewhere in America, coming to India and living like a common man, saving every rupee and adjusting in 83 rupees a day, you gave me this award as I stood an inspiration for the youth. But in my opinion, you shouldn't be giving this award to me. Mr. Bhargav Deserve this. Why is he saying that Bhargav's name? Why because I being in this competition have voted to him. More than us being Billionaires and coming to live like a common man, Mr. Bhargav leaving his business worth Billions in Dubai and coming here to live as a common man. He is not like a regular politician. He is an icon. In fact, when people like Bhargav are in politics, many more from us will become youth icons. What wrong with him? I didn't understand that. Sorry Bhargav, I can't. Sorry guys. You may be thinking about what is Aravind talking after coming onto the stage. What I just spoke before are not the words coming from my heart. The words said by Bhargav that I should be speaking only this way. Hey, what's he talking? What exactly is he saying? I hid a few facts from you all, for so long. As you all think, I haven't come here to live as a common man leaving aside Billion of wealth and comforts. When my dad sent me away from home thinking I'd get bettered at least by sending me to India, I came here. From the day I came here, I always thought about how to escape from here but never thought even for a second to stay back here. And this is the truth that I have been hiding. At such a time, Bhargav knowing all the truths about us came. And asked me to say great about him in the award function and to support in his election campaign. Do something to him guys. Chakri, get that live stopped first, stop that live. He said to send us to America with his money if we do as he said. He threatened to expose the truths before you all if I don't do. All my lies till date were just for my selfish purpose and for me to live. But if I listen to Bhargav now and do as he said and go back to America, it'd be like I'll be cheating you all. I want to stop just at the lies and I don't want to cheat. Instead, to cheat and win, I wish to lose in front of you all by being loyal. You are right dad, you did a great thing by sending me to India. I don't know what I learned from the College I studied but I learned a lot in the University named India. I never used to think even for a second while spending thousands of Dollars. But after coming to India I thought a hundred times before spending every hundred rupees. I came to know the value of money. Before, when the food wasn't tasty or if my order comes late, I used to throw that. But after I came here, I slept drinking water when I had nothing to eat. I came to know about the value of hunger. I never used to repeat a dress I wear. But now, when I'm washing the same clothes and wearing them again, I feel some strange attachment growing with them. I came to know about the value of things too. While in America. I too like a guy from there I too used to think like am I good, how am I, how much am I earning, did I develop and so on I was always focused just about myself because that's the American life. But after coming to India, a girl used to call me uncle, a grandpa called grandson, a friend called dude, kids called as uncle and they called with different names. I coming as Aravind here, got so many identities mixed up. You aren't neighbour dude, you're my best friend, love you dude. Though I was nothing to them, they made me one among them. I then understood that we can get great happiness in life even from relationships and not just from luxuries. We got cheated when in the greed of more money. We cheated when in greed for big name. I selfishly thought to get more votes in the. Youth Icon contest by using the slum people's strike. But I felt ashamed when they risked their lives for us not to get beaten. But I felt ashamed. I wasn't of any use to you all, but you were of great help for a change in me. Thanking you all for that, I'm sorry for hurting you all with such a big lie. I'm sorry. And one last thing before I leave, Because of the Chemical factory. Netaji Nagar people are suffering a lot from so many years. Thus I request the Government on behalf of. Netaji Nagar people to immediately close down that factory. And one last thing before I leave, Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Super, Avi. Neha, I'm sorry. Enough. The controversy of young leader Bhargav shook the Assembly today. The opposition has made the Government face hard times in this matter. As there's been strong opposition over this even from the public, we can say great pressure is mounted upon the ruling party now. No chance to leave the guy alive, who made me fool. You've written an end even before your political life has started. Why's this arrogance still for you? Do as said by senior first, if you want to be at least like a son. Go. I feel ashamed to say as the party President that an evil man like Bhargav is in this party. I am suspending him immediately from the party. When we are on the public's side, the public will be on our side. I inform that Government will close down that. Chemical Factory and will sue the Management in court. So kids, your dad's salary is 10000 rupees. He gave you 5% from that to you as pocket money and what is your pocket money? It's less than what your dad gave you, son. Dad. Dad. I sent you as you should change, son I didn't expect you to change so much. Enough son, come let's go back now. I don't feel like to come back dad. Avi, I sent for you to know the value of hard work. But not for you to be in continuous hard times I'll get my degree in the next two years and I too will come. Then, what shall I say to your mom? Say that I got a fair Telugu girl and I'll be coming with her. Who this girl? Neha, not knowing how to become close to you, I said a lie on the spot. I'm saying the same what I said that day. Other than the small mistakes unknowingly, it's enough that you believe I'm not as bad as you think I'll believe. But like uncle coming home drunk and hitting aunt, you shouldn't behave so after our marriage. Then I'll believe. What's hitting aunt? I don't drink at all. Dad, that is. What you used me like this? Just to impress the girl You sinner! Oh no, so many entries by the time I finished my bath? It's ok uncle, give me his passport size photo if you have any. Why man? Why do you ask like you don't know? He anyways doesn't seem to be coming back to the US after his course is finished. If we arrange for his Aadhar card, Ration card, Pan card, and wedding card if possible by then, he can permanently settle here. Stop that rubbish! Come on, click a photo. Your aunt will feel happy by sending this to her. Come on dear, come I haven't done this work only for your family. Aravind exposing his truths saying he's not eligible to be the Youth Icon. Mr. Niranjan, have you seen this? I've already said to you that he's a cheap third grade character. You didn't believe me. Not just that sir, it seems a girl got connected to him in the college. They both are seen together all around. Is it? Yes. Did he flatter? Did he set? See Sir, all these are 420 cases. Their job is to cheat either the society if possible or the girls. We've been calling them to our channels, washing their feet and making them into celebrities. Sir, I'm telling you, we have to eliminate these people from the society. Ban them Sir, they are a threat to democracy. Sir, they are young. They'd either love, roam around or do whatever they wish. Why for us, Sir? Ours are the lives where five EMIs get cut before the 5th. Let's look after our work Sir. Not that Mr. Niranjan, you should have a basic social. Waste! No one can save this society Sir, no one. Law takes its own course and Mr. Niranjan keeps throwing. Come on throw it, sir, Take
