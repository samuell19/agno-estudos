lake road and state 16. hi larry madrid central to unit 4. larry are you on patrol hi mr vernon kind of uh taking up a lot of road there weren't you so i'm gonna get a good cast my tire looks like okay show you something let's get a notching on that thing could have been a piece of glass i suppose i know it's too sharp too clean you mean like it was deliberately cut yeah hey what's with this guy killing on a public highway in the middle of the day using a stolen red car and now this might as well left a trail of breadcrumbs you suppose he's setting us up for something hey rudy did you check the road service between here and highway 16 yeah fresh skid marks on both sides of the road both shoulders looks like a crossword from one side or the other at high speed let me see that again oh that's how he hooked larry he stages so it looked like a drunken driver larry took after him like he should and you want me to get on the horn and lay down at 10.72 no you won't pick up anything at a roadblock you can bet he's already ditched the car makes sense if he had everything else planned out he sure would have figured out what to do with that car hey you guys come here finish up there you know something i wonder if he meant us to know that he was someone larry knew you saying larry knew the problem yeah rudy how would you approach a possible stolen car saying my beads follow you show me well sir in this case here we're just one subject that's it larry's gun was still strapped down larry was a first-rate officer he didn't make these mistakes unless he recognized the driver you know whoever planned this thing had larry all figured out just you know just what he'd do and then what we do i wonder how much he does know about us have a table oh i'll have a waitress right over here yeah right away enjoy you listen cord if you want to dance oh no no later we came to talk and get re-acquainted martini fine do martinez please now tell me about flynn donahue according it's not a very interesting story i wasn't sure you knew about him know about him listen a guy goes with a girl for three years she helps marry somebody else without even writing him a letter people uh let him know even in korea listen court i felt as hemmed in by this town as you did i didn't marry flynn until i heard you signed on for another tour with the naval air corps oh yeah and then you couldn't wait to marry your cowboy oh come on cowhan donna he was no cowhand he was 17th money winner in the rodeo circuit in 1956 and we traveled we went to california and madison square garden and calgary and canada and bucketville and boise what is stuff put on you don't care about flynn donna you and you putting me through all this how are you jimmy uh excuse me listen i got the plane again coming sunday a week so uh give me a call please what plan i talk about uh uh just a company fleeing i i i fly a company plane for oil company court it's not important and you're flying the plane where well just flying out there later pick up a new drill bit he's had a couple of drinks let it go and you uh intend to take this lady with you oh sure don't you hey look at that guy come on never never embarrass a lady like that this is a lady of quality dignity and repute never never presumed buddy chin up smile smile and this is the bullet that capital city pd sent it was taken from bob maxwell and the second one is the expended bullet that killed larry i've never seen two bullets quite like these this first one is three grains heavier and yet they're both full jacketed 22 longs olive oil you ever see a carpet jacket in hollow point before no not hollow point we used full jacketed 22s during the war they were issued for survival rifles that's right to conform to the geneva convention but they weren't hollow point you couldn't get hollow point over the counter i'd say that these cartridges came from a military depot you want a flying gas on these year bullets i'd say they'd been monkeyed with our fella took this gi ammunition and drilled the head so they flatten out on impact judging the weight of the bullets he board one of them out more than the other for higher ballistics coefficiency i think ballistics coefficiency you mean for better flight don't you more accuracy yeah you could say that change then why didn't you say it a couple years in college these kids can't even speak english no hold on wait now what you're trying to say is the gunman used two bullets one was heavier than the other right right the first one that's correct with a 41 grain bullet you see it was a longer shot that killed maxwell so it had to be more accurate when he shot larry he drilled a hole in the nose of the bullet he made it lighter and 38 grains could increase the flattening upon impact here's more effective in close-up see the lands and the grooves and the bearing surface tells us that the barrel was a seven right twist specialized cartridge specialized gun we've been through the books too the only weapon with the seven ride is a russian 22 automatic made for international rapid fire competition you know on top of that he used the silencer right well that's it beginning to see things now i want to see but now that we're up against somebody that knows what he's doing a pro am i going to be able to talk to you in the state inside okay joni i'll tell him the attorney general's on the phone for you okay thanks pete so yeah clean why what's the matter you're trying to keep me out of madrid look the grand jury doesn't convene until yeah okay oh jj they want me back in capital city brian good thing yeah well there's one thing you can do for me though when i'm gone why check county record and see if court vernon still holds title to any land in madrid

told him i didn't want to marry the place i just wanted to live here he told me what happened that day he tried to bribe him that's a lie boy the way some people twist everything you say here's what i said to him i said i like the community i've got no ties with the organization anymore i just want to live a quiet life with my family that's what you said that's what i said and i said something else i said i want to do something civic you know for the place like uh donate to the local hospital the law officers retirement fund i could have mentioned that and then i asked him for his suggestion i spent a couple of fortunes making a lady out of you so i can't repeat his suggestion you've always been a very amusing man nick when it suited you when you wanted something or were trying to get off of a subject that bothered you i want to finish talking about this assassination or whatever sam may not like you but he wouldn't say something like that unless he believed it so maybe he believes it and maybe he's trying to get rid of me maybe just maybe he's trying to make points with you for a smart man nick you don't understand your daughter at all you haven't got the first idea of how it was between sam and me do you um i know you saw him sometimes sure so i saw him a lot sam cade is possibly the best thing that ever happened to me so yeah thing for him he got over no i didn't he cared for me too but he let me go sam never told me the uh the entire truth about you nick i uh really wasn't ready to believe it then he let me find that out for myself a few years later sam walked away from our relationship you wanna know why you're gonna tell me anyway so go ahead because he knew you better than i did he knew that if he became involved with me you would use it come on steffy you

myself whether or not i wanted to come back but that nick only had a few weeks to live so i came he didn't know about it nobody did so the terribly ironic part is they were killing a dead man what

you any kramer he said you'd know what to do with those how about you stephanie are you still a girl on the run sort of oh i had thought about coming back to madrid with four or five cats and dogs to
