Don't forget to put in your ballot. And let's test out those survivor skills. Vanessa Lemor-- Vanessa Lemor, Principal Applebomb is ready to meet with you. Ms. Lemor, nice to meet you. The opening ceremony is an opportunity for the school to embrace diversity and celebrate the achievements of our students. As the Molly Hootch Scholar, you will have the honour of being a keynote speaker. Conventionally, the Molly Hootch Scholarship goes to an Eskimo student from a rural area. I'm not really. I mean, my dad is Eskimo. Yup'ik, he's Yup'ik. Yes. But my mom's from Fairbanks. I'm from Fairbanks. A valid point that I made note of, but the Georgey family-- I believe you know them-- Made quite the case making the final decision. Here is your schedule. I suggest that you get to work. Good luck. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Switch. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Switch. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Switch. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. ÷ ÷Switch. One, two... What are they doing? Three, four, five... High kick. All of Snowstorm Survivor is based off traditional Native games. Might consider participating seeing that it's, you know, part of your heritage. My dad's heritage. Regardless, it's the quintessential Nichols experience. Only third-tier FUBAR personalities reject traditions in high school. What's a FUBAR? I need two volunteer team leaders! Anybody? Philip, Nate. These are your team captains! Everyone else, line 'em up on the black line, blue line, front row, back row! Let's move! Today we are doing an adaptation of the four-man carry, the two-man carry relay. This game was created to test your strength and focus. Philip... and Ryan are going to help me demonstrate. Now, in the olden days, after a successful hunt, the Eskimos packed their game and hauled it long distance back to tribe. See? Not so tough. Nate, heads or tails? Heads. Tails. Sean. Vanessa. Now, being that there is no "I" in "team," you can't have a competition without any competitors. Line 'em up! Excuse me, Jon, do you think we could do a practice session? Why? You want to touch me? Jen? Excuse me, Jen? Line it up, people. Ladies, practice is over. All right, I want you to engage your core muscles! Most of you couldn't carry a taco back to you Native tribe, much less an 800-lb. walrus. First team's up! Dig deep! Dig deep! Strength and focus! Strength and focus! Come on! All right, Vanessa, come on! Come on, Van-- Come on, get up. Come on! Told you. All right, all right, all right, all right. Everybody just move back. Move back. In fact, go line up! Give me five laps and then we'll regroup. Mr. Georgey, I think you should be giving me five laps. I'm Vanessa's advisor. Vanessa is about to head down to the weight room. Would you like to join her? You sound like a herd of elephants! Lighten up, people! "I love you. I love you. I love you." Hi, I'm Hercules. I haven't played sports since middle school, because I'm allergic to pollen and the plastic they use in sports equipment. Why are you here? I fell down. I have a case of fibromyalgia, so I'm exempt for all physical activity. Fibro--? I bet you can't tell. I've been to specialists all over the world. This position relaxes my muscles. I'm Sam. Madeline doesn't even have a doctor's note. Roach gets frustrated because she's so fat and slow: she just sent her down here. My mom says gym teachers are uneducated and low class. Dear Lemon Lima: I'm not sure what FUBAR means, but I think it has something to do with tremendous suffering and not competing in the Snowstorm Survivor Competition. I wonder if Philip will be president someday. My speech is going to be noteworthy, unique, thought-provoking and impressive. Sometimes I wonder if I was adopted. The woman who calls herself my mother is a wasteful ogre. She's clearly unaware of her gigantic environmental footprint. It reminds me of when Philip and I chained ourselves to an oilrig to protest the inevitable extinction of polar bears. He has such a big heart. It's an extremely informative sport. I'm just not sure if he's ready. Nichols' club has the top skeet shooters in the state. I just don't think it's right for a growing boy to have such an unhealthy attachment to a stupid animal. Hercules Howard? I'm going to count to five. One, two-- Bambi needs to find her bunny friend. No! ♪ That little girl is so odd. She can sit behind you or you. I'm going to sit in the middle, because I'm equally mad. Now, Hercules, we both know that that is the most dangerous place to sit in this car. Sit behind your father. Hey, sport, your mother and I bought you some new friends. Please don't make this difficult for your mother. ♪ No, I'm not! Amigone? No, I'm not! Amigone? No, I'm not! Amigone? No, I'm not! Hey, Amigone, show me your alien breasts! May I have your attention, please? For the new students, this is "quiet coyote." She's so weird. And it means stop talking! Thank you. Welcome to Nichols. In honour of the upcoming World Appreciation Week, we have a very special Athabaskan dance presentation by the Dream Dancers. ♪ ♪ Oh, so wonderful. The Dream Dancers! And now I'd like to introduce our Molly Hootch Scholar, Vanessa Lemor. Fibromyalgia, some born with twisted bodies and disfigured faces, suspended in space and locked in sterile places. No one can free a soul, not one white coat can stop a life from taking its toll. The smallest creature floats in an endless sea, swimming alone and letting everything be. The depths loom beneath and the world remains equipped with razor-sharp teeth. Someone needs to let in a ray of light. Someone needs to stop the fight. Thank you very much, Vanessa. That was very unique. And now for the announcement of the team captains for Snowstorm Survivor Competition! Coach Roach is here to announce the team captains who will have the honour of performing an interpretive Native dance for the final, and I have to say, my favourite part of the competition. Coach? Ahem, I know you all are very excited to head to your classes, so I'm going to make this brief. When I say your name, which was randomly selected, please step to the front. Philip Georgey, sophomore. Mara Marsh, senior. Sean Walsh, sophomore. And the only freshman chosen this year, Vanessa Lemor. As is custom, the teams will be chosen at next assembly, so let's have another round of applause here for our team leaders. Dismissed. Dear Lemon Lima: I wish Philip would see me the way he sees Megan. Her hair is the colour of a lemon creamsicle. Mine is the colour of dirt. I tried to embrace my peers, but all I found was a dead bunny in a puddle. I can't believe Philip didn't like my speech. He used to be a human-rights activist. As hapless gentle creatures are swallowed by this funnel of life-- I grow older and less popular. If the only way into Philip's heart is the Snowstorm Survivor Competition, then I will face my destiny. I am no longer a window shopper in this mini-mall of life. I will no longer stand in the shade. I plunge into brash sunlight. Hi, Vanessa. I'm Hercules. We met in the weight room. Is that your house? Well, just so you know, that's my house, so we can take the bus together. Why is your hair white? It's blonde. Blonde is yellow. Your hair is white. Yeah, well, it's blonde. Is it okay if I wait with you? What about here? Okay. Can anyone tell me why we have Native Appreciation Class? Jon? I don't know. Okay, that's fair. Marshall? So we can learn to respect Natives and how they're different from us. Can anyone tell me how many Native tribes exist in Alaska? Vanessa? Vanessa, I'm sure you can name at least one. I'm more white than Native, so-- Ah, did everyone notice that our only Eskimo student refers to herself as white? I think that what Vanessa is saying is that she has assimilated into white culture. In the early 1900s, assimilation was the popular solution to the problem of Native rights. Jon? What was the problem with their rights? They didn't have any. The problem is we moved here, kicked them off their own land, got them drunk and introduced disease. FUBAR! Now, seeing that we have the Molly Hootch Scholar in our class, a special-topics presentation will be made. Vanessa, will you be so kind as to prepare a report on the Molly Hootch case? And Two Old Women is one of the books on our reading list. ♪ ♪ Remember, the blanket toss is a team activity! You are your teammate's lifeline! We're not just going for airtime or height! You are each a Native hunter, looking over the landscape for your tribe's survival! Okay, one, two, three! ♪ Good! Yes! We are all Snowstorm Survivors here, working together! Yes! No! Wait, Jon, no, you got to pull it! You're losing the grip! Jon! Matt! Corner! Ugh! Vanessa, on your feet. March it back to the weight room. Hey, where were you? Can't talk. I do it all the time. Once I cried for three weeks. My pet monkey died. He had AIDS. Obviously, he didn't contract it in my house. Juju had AIDS when I got him. He was a present from Nigeria. My dad had a concert there. Why is your hair white? It's supposed to be blonde. It's safe here. That's Emmaline and Lynne. Hey, you want to join our Cigarette Club? We meet on Saturdays. That sounds really nice, but I don't smoke. Neither do we. Yeah, smoking is really bad for you. It's been proven in many studies to cause malignant neoplasm. Cancer. My uncle died of cancer, and he only smoked for a week. We just collect high-end cigarettes. And cigars. Kind of like a book club. Or a foreign-film club, only we share of scourged cigarettes. Can I come? You're allergic. I am not. I have work. Your parents let you work? Hey, we could take a field trip and come visit you. I can't afford any distractions this year. Work is really my first priority. Ooh, I see the oldest of the Sellars just passed. He was a nice man. Smart too. I wonder if he's being buried or cremated. Honey, you want some more? Mom, I've given it some serious thought, and I'm changing my name. Oh. Legally. Okay. To "Nothing." Oh! Wow, that's... Unique. Have you given some thought to some other names? Maybe there's a list that we could see. No, "Nothing." ♪ Hi. Hi. How's your arm? Um, okay. I thought we were vegetarians. I-- I developed an allergy to iron pills. Oh, well, where are you sitting? Ness, you can't expect to sit wherever you'd like. I wasn't asking-- Yes, you were. This school has a caste system, and because of your weight-room demotion, you're a serf. Antics like your speech are not going to get people to like you. Do you even know what fibromyalgia is? I was trying to-- A made-up disease for hypochondriacs. I really suggest stepping down as Snowstorm Survivor captain. Do you really think you're capable of getting in front of an audience and dancing? You'll be really humiliated. I don't care. Exactly. You told me to do it. Ness, I am human. I make mistakes. On a more personal note, I really suggest dying your hair a more reasonable shade. People are staring. I have to go. I totally have anorexia. Me too but you have to stop when you're 16 or you grow a beard. That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. Have you seen Philip Georgey? Gross, the nerd? No, he's totally hot and cool now. He went to France and he speaks French. You can't grow out of nerdiness. You were a total loser in middle school. Someone's spying on us. It's a FUBAR, no biggie. I'm also allergic to dust mites, but most people are allergic to that. Most people aren't allergic to sea bass, and I am. Dear Lemon Lima: I'm stunned into silence. The cold plastic of a sticky bus seat screamed the truth. FUBAR, how could those five letters be so cruel? How could Philip be so unkind? He is the gum on the bottom of my flip-flops. He is a slug and our relationship was a trail of slime. Definitely made me dumber and a loser with no social skills. I am bad at sports, I don't have a singing voice, and my mom cuts my hair. And in spite of all this, I thank you for making me a serf, an uneducated, physically retarded, untouchable serf. At least I'm not a P-I-G. Ness? Yeah? Are you lighting things on fire? They're photos of Philip. Well, amen, finally. Vanessa, you have a phone call. Hello? Hello, is this Vanessa? Yes. Oh, hello, Vanessa. This is Hercules. I called the school secretary for your information. I hope you don't mind. I'm calling about the Cigarette Club. Would you like to take me to the club meeting tomorrow? As I would like that. That's really nice of you, but I'm not much of a club person. I believe most of the members aren't in other clubs, except Emmaline and Lynne. They're in lots of clubs. And they're the presidents of Science League. I guess I could give you a ride. Really? Well, thank you. If you can call my mother Mrs. Howard-- And please don't mention the word "cigarette." Perhaps you can call it a rifle club instead. And let my mother know I'll be home by 5:00. Have a seat. Have a seat. Have a seat. Now, I know that everyone is very excited. So am I. But I'd like to make a qualification from our last meeting. Remember the wonderful Native dancers we had who did the special demonstration? Well, they were Aleutian, not Athabaskan. And today I am very proud and honoured to be wearing a part of their traditional regalia in celebration of diversity and multiculturalism! Isn't it wonderful? Oh, it's so wonderful. What a wonderful culture. And now the moment that we have all been waiting for. Will our team captains of Snowstorm Survivor please stand? As is our tradition, the most disadvantaged team captain will make the first pick. And this year that honour goes to our Molly Hootch Scholar, Vanessa Lemor. Nothing Amigone. Nate Jefferson. Samantha Combs. Emmaline Chin. Lynne Chin. Hercules Howard. Whoo hoo, yeah! Team FUBAR. Miss Lemor, Principal Applebomb is ready for you. Excuse me? The principal, Applebomb, is ready. Hello? Applebomb is ready. Thank you. Ms. Lemor, I'd like to discuss a couple of issues. Let's being with your team name. Change it. Second issue, how do you plan to participate in the competition? I feel I have chosen the strongest competitors. Oh, please, I am not a fool. They are all benchwarmers, and confined to the weight room for a very good reason. And what about little Hercules? "Hercule," my fanny. How is he going to participate when he is allergic to air? And don't think that he can compete without a signed permission slip from his mother. Good luck with that. I have taken it upon myself to be the team's faculty advisor. This is a brochure from the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics, and here's a pamphlet on Native dance. Of course, perhaps you are familiar with one of the Yup'ik dances? No, of course not. Well, fortunately we have several representatives from WEIO who are going to offer demonstrations this week. It's not mandatory but highly recommended. Ness, don't wrinkle up. It makes you look like your dad. That's your fault. Yup, it is. Did you know anything about Native dance? Nope. Of course not. Ness, it just wasn't my thing. It doesn't mean it can't be a part of you, right? It doesn't mean it can't be your thing. Vanessa! Hi, I'm Hercules' mother, Mrs. Howard. You must be Mrs. Lemor. You can call me Terri. Whoops, sorry, guys. Hi, Terri. I'm Hercules. Ooh, I love your He-Man backpack. I keep telling him he's too old for it. He simply won't listen. Oh, come on, you're never too old for He-Man, right? Is everybody buckled up? Hercules, do you want to put on your seatbelt? I'm looking but I-- Oh, we kind of lost them along the way, so he can sit up in front in-- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I think he's best in back. I never let him sit in the front, even when it's the two of us. You know, car accidents are the Hercules, you just sit behind Terri, and call me when Rifle Club is done. Fine. Bye. ♪ Poems, steaks, collaboration of static. Gay monkey experiments expose addicts. Heartbreaks: infatuations manic. Great bunny casts magic missiles on dragon. Hey, did you finish reading Two Old Women? Yeah, did you? No. These two old women are betrayed by their tribe before winter. The people they grew up with just leave them behind to starve and die. That kind of sounds like us in the weight room. Yeah, it does. You're leaving out the second part of the story. The women decide that if they're going to die, they might as well die trying. So they start to provide for themselves, while the tribe spends the entire winter starving. And once they refine their survival skills, it's really the tribe that comes to them begging for help. We should make this our competition. If Team F dies, at least we can die trying. If you guys are with me, you can all close your eyes. Vanessa, I just would like you to know that if I'm dying, I'd like to be with you, because you're good at making things better. So now if you won't do that, then I don't want to close my eyes, because I don't want to die alone. Want if I closed my eyes with you? Yes, I would like that very much. ♪ The World Eskimo-Indian Olympics have become a cultural point of pride that uphold the enduring character and traditions of the Eskimo Indians. Where are his teammates? There are no teams. If one person wins, then everybody wins. It benefits the whole community. The event recognizes the value of tribal collaboration as a survival tool. So bring your friends and family... Hey, Onion. She just talked about WEIO? Yeah, it looks really fun. I think it's great that you're taking interest in your heritage, although none of this information will really prove useful in Snowstorm Survivor. I would invite you to my team meetings, but it would be a conflict of interest. May I suggest maybe working out a little bit, doing some push-ups, definitely running a few laps with your team. Dear Lemon Lima: this magical world of human beings showers me with inspiration. Today, I practiced my Yup'ik fan dance in the weight room. Hercules said it brought a tear to his eye, but I suspect it was allergies. As the days float by, my aching heart begins to mend. Samantha said she began a hunger strike to mentally prepare herself for Snowstorm Survivor, but I smelled Tater Tots on her breath yesterday at practice. I wonder what her dad is like. She probably has a great relationship with her father. Anyway, I can't be late for Cigarette Club. It's on. Ooh. How do you say "compassion"? That wasn't in Spanish. Compasion. Compasion. Perfecto! ♪ I would prefer not to discuss this. Well, I prefer to discuss this. Really? Because I don't think it's appropriate. I mean, Vanessa was really in love with me, so it makes sense that she's producing work based off our time together. I don't understand. Yeah, well, it is the root of the problem. See, I just don't think we're intellectually compatible. And what does that mean? Megan, I'm in AP English, and you're in the most mentally challenged class we have at this school. You read Judy Blume. I read Dostoevsky. I am not a lesbian. I know. I know you're attracted to me. And although sexual attraction might complicate things, our intellectual incompatibility is off the charts. His name's G.I. Joe. He's so beautiful. Do you want to see my other pets? Sure. "NOTHING": Where do you find all these? Sometimes in the backyard. The black ones live in our house. They're dead. That's their cemetery. So they can all be together. Hercules, do you want to bring your little friends into the living room? So, Samantha, what do your parents do? My dad's a singer. How different. Her dad's Puff Daddy. And what's that? Oh, like he raps, hip-hop sort of stuff. You know. Vanessa, what about your parents? My mom has written a few self-help books. Isn't that different? And your dad? I don't really know him. It's terrible to lose a parent. I'm so sorry. Your mother must be devastated. Not really. Oh? My parents haven't been together since I was really young. Divorce? Oh, no, they were never married, so they never really went through the divorce thing. I should check on dinner. ♪ ♪ Ness? I'm sleeping. Ouch! How was dinner? Those people leave a bad taste in my mouth. They leave a bad taste in their mouths. I don't care. I don't need to be friends with people that let their children play with rifles, hah.

If he's your best friend, let's all go to the park together. It's not about the park. I have to start making my own decisions. I mean, you don't know what he's really like. He told me he'd ride across the ocean on the head of a shrimp for me. Well, we'd run across the ocean on the head of a shark. What's your point? He's the reason I know you. He pushed me to do it. And because of him, I chose you guys. What? Who else would you choose? I-- I don't know. That's not the point. I feel used. You know, we have feelings too. Does this mean you're not going to be on our team? F-U, traitor. It's fine if you'd like to risk your life. My proposal for the day is a movie, hm? It's too hot out, and I didn't bring sun block. On a side note, made any decisions regarding Snowstorm Survivor? I'm not sure but I figure it happened for a reason. Yeah, my family. Look, Ness, you know, I appreciate your interest in the games, but it's simply unsafe for you to compete with that team. Okay, Ness, you know, say, you are a baker, and you make cupcakes for a living. And one day you decide to quit. Then you start making cupcakes again. But then you quit again. Then you quit again. Then you start making cupcakes again. Ness? Dear Lemon Lima-- Very mature, Ness! I tried to reach for the sky, but all I got were storm clouds under my nails. The symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, headache, body ache. Fibromyalgia is real. I traded in a shark for a shrimp and nearly drowned. My heart is a balloon bursting with humility as I return to my tribe of true warriors. I am no longer a slave to Philip's flawless bone structure and undeniable charm. I wonder if my father would be proud. Well, Ms. Lemor, what pearls of wisdom do you have for us today? Molly Hootch. Molly Hootch was a Native student who brought a case against the state of Alaska for failing to provide village high schools, forcing Eskimo and Indian students to attend boarding schools, sometimes hundreds of miles away from their families. In 1972, Henry Walters, then president of Nichols, founded the generous Molly Hootch Scholarship. Well done, Ms. Lemor. A little lacking in details but altogether not bad. I'm not finished. Walters was widely regarded as a bigot who refused to allow Native students into this esteemed private school. Walters instituted the Molly Hootch Scholarship to undo the damage to his reputation. I am honoured to be the beneficiary of the Molly Hootch Scholarship because it reminds me that young Native girls do not have to put up with disreputable people in positions of power. Anything to say? I don't like him. As I'm sure you know, Mr. Walters is the grandson of Henry Walters and a member of the board who endows your scholarship. Now, you may not care personally, but your behaviour as a Molly Hootch Scholar has had a bad reflection on your community and their values. For goodness sakes, he is an elder. Miss Lemor, I believe that you are well intentioned. I do. Now, we are just two weeks away from the school's most celebrated competition. I hope that you take this opportunity to channel your creativity into an endeavour that will bring you a wider audience. Power does not need to be loud or noticed. Look at the icebergs and the mountains. They are both very silent. Get outta here. ♪ ♪ Dear Lemon Lima: Last night I dreamt of my father. I couldn't see his face, but I knew it was him. He turned to me and said, "Love and accept yourself, and I will love and accept you." Then he morphed into a walrus and swam away. We will compete in the Snowstorm Survivor Competition. The prize we seek is honour, not victory. The high kick is how Native villagers would signal the capture of a whale. Hercules, since you're the smallest, I think it would make the most sense if you enter. Can I show you something? If you shift your body weight, it's a lot easier. Wow, why are you down here?

And to our surprise, the finalists in the stick pole are "Nothing" Amigone-- No, I'm not. From Team F-- And three-time champion and team captain, Sean Walsh. We'd like to quickly thank the Amigone Funeral Home, one of our event sponsors, a family serving families. And here we go. "Nothing" is holding on to secure Team F's uncanny lead. And, oh, tough break! And that's how quickly the tables turn. We love you, "Nothing"! Team F is very lucky that the winner must win two out of three attempts. We're tied one to one! Such strength was necessary when pulling a seal through a breathing hole. "Nothing" is the first female to ever make it to the final round. All right, "Nothing"! I love you, baby! I love you! Come on! Fatso. Yeah! Whoa! Wah! ♪ Do you guys see any survival purpose to this? Well, see how her ear's red? That's what it looks like after frostbite. Following cold exposure, the ear is red and painful. Do you think she's okay? Yeah, she's doing it on purpose. Sam could win anything she wants. She's totally pathological but a genius, master manipulator. She claims her dad's going to come pick us up in a limo. Yes! I want to congratulate you, Ness. I really think you took some of my advice to heart, but my money is on my man Nate to come in first at the high kick, and I think I have this dance competition in the bag. Let's face the facts, Ness. Teacher never loses to the student. Strawberry, you're a real piece of work. Can we please have the competitors to the stage? The Alaskan high kick was a way to signal the capture of a whale. Screaming Bald Eagles, to your mark! Growling Grizzlies, to your mark! Hey, back it up! Good! Good! Arctic Wolves, to your mark! Team F, to your mark! Good! Good! Whoo! Good! Raising it up for level two! Good! Out! Oh, Cody's down! Out! The Howling Hunters are out. Good! And it is Team F versus the Growling Grizzles. ♪ Oh, what a tragedy for Megan from Team F. And it's Nate. Good! We have a winner! It's Nate Jackson from the Growling Grizzlies! Team F and the Growling Grizzlies are now in a dead heat. I'm sorry. I-- I thought I had it. I couldn't hold it anymore, and then my leg and my arms and I just-- It doesn't matter. But it did. The dance routine I'm doing has been in my family for years. Really? Yeah, totally. The Screaming Bald Eagles! Wasn't that wonderful? Oh, such an exciting day. And now we will have the Growling Grizzlies doing their interpretation of the Inupiaq Walrus Hunting Dance. Growling Grizzlies! ♪ Grr! The Growling Grizzlies! Oh, Philip, you were so forceful. I didn't know he had it in him. Now this next group, I will admit a bit of a prejudice. I am the team's faculty advisor. Someone said I look like a pink cupcake today, and I said, "Well, that's what I was going for." Now Team F presenting their version of a Yup'ik Eskimo igloo dance, Vanessa Lemor! FUBAR! Shh! ♪ ♪ Every year, something new and unexpected happens in these games, as new leaders rise to the challenge... I think Sam's dad's here. Is there a limo? Look. Whoa, I thought she was lying. Do you guys want to cut out early? Yeah. But by pulling together and working hard to build team morale and endurance-- Megan. They rose to the challenge. If Team F could join me on the podium to accept their trophies and their tracksuits so generously donated-- So very generously donated by Lady Foot Locker. Thank you. If-- If Vanessa Lemor could join me on the podium--?
