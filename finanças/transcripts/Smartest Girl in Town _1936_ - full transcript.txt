- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes They really don't understand cr?pe suzette in America, that's why I never cross in any American boat. I always use a French line myself. Oh, yes, I know that French line. It's something about... "Mademoiselle from Armenti?res, parlez vous?", isn't it? - Well, I guess you got her. - Come on, let's go home. Right. - Oh, so you don't let a lady out first. - What lady? - Aw. Come on, you lugs, step on it! Come on, Cookie, come on. Peel the carcasses in there. In there, Cookie, and make it snappy. Gwen, get that silver fox cape back to the Jason Fur Company tonight. Charge them three models at $7.50 and overtime for the camera crew. Three models at $7.50, overtime for the camera crew... ...and the lady typist can starve in the gutter. Here you are, Phoebe, back in stock. - My, it's soft. - The skin you love to touch. But with me it's touch and go. Some day I want to take off a silver fox cape and find my initials in the lining. - Yea, ma'am! - Back in stock. From Bernie's bouffant black to bargain basement blue. You oughta get yourself a sweet daddy and buy you bouffant blacks for keeps. Yea, man! I want to open my own closet and find a row of them growing there. - Is that all? - No. I want a hat to match every dress and shoes to match every hat. No diamond clips? Aw, and Carthay has such neat ones in the window. Why not? Your sister sure has got the right idea. - Figure it out how you're gonna get them. - I'm going to marry him. Seems to me I've heard that before. I lay you odds you'll do the same thing I did. Fall in love with some boob who hasn't a thin dime... ...and marry him because two can live as cheaply as one. On your salary. - Here you are, Phoebe. - Back in stock? Must be plenty of rich men after you, Miss Cookie. All you got to do is say the word. Yes, but I want to say it with orange blossoms. I don't want to wake up one morning and find myself back in stock. Oh! Oh, those bargain basement blues. - I'll sew it for you. - Oh, will you, Phoebe, thank you. - You ready, Cookie? - For what? Well, I thought maybe tonight you'd like to stop over for a bowl chili. Well, I wouldn't thank you. Alright. What's the matter with her, is she too ritzy for chili? Oh, no, maybe it's too chilly for the Ritz. What did you do, give him the dowager's nose again? Why not? He doesn't earn any more than I do. Besides, I don't go out with guys that earn 7.50 a day some days. But in the end you'll run true to form. Some big slug will come along that needs mothering. And you'll wake up one morning and find you've taken a job for life. Mother guy? Hm, that's a hot one. Hm, I found that out. - Oh, somebody's calling us. - Oh, goodie. Hello? Oh, send him up. - It's Baron Torini. - How did he know I was here? - Did you tell him? - Well, um... He called the office this morning. Now there's a guy who could upholster your sofa in silver fox. - Oh... - There. Can you beat it? The guy sees her in front of a bird store, follows her into the office, doesn't try to pick her up, hands his card to the president and gets an introduction according to Hoyle. My, my, if you read it in a book, you wouldn't believe it. And then sends his car for her every night. Yes, and he's always in it, and all he ever does is drive me home and leave me there. What do you want him to do, move in? You know, he's the kind of a guy that breaks down an orange blossom... ...if you play him right. What's wrong with him? There's nothing wrong with him, there's nothing right with him. He's a foreigner, I don't understand him and he's a bore. All he needs is warming up. Wait till you get him in second gear. Phoebe, did you ever hear of a guy who collects birds' eggs? No, Mam! Oh, what's the difference what he collects as long as he has the habit? You can get him to collect furs, emeralds, diamonds just as easy. - Who's there? - I mean, come in. Signorina, I am here! I have knocked at your door like a woodpecker... and at your feet I lay... Wait a minute, whatever it is, lay it in here. And how is the beautiful little ladybird this evening? Fine, thank you. You remember my sister Mrs. Mayen? - Ah, s?, s?. - Of course, how are you, Baron? Oh, I am like the lark. And may I have the honor to accompany you to your residential? - We're going out to eat. - Ah, yes, to eat. She is the music of life. Yes, especially the soup. - Um... have you had your dinner? - Ah, s?, s?. The minetsrone, the spaghetti and the scaloppini prepared with parmesan cheese. I haven't heard such language since my last operation. And I have remembered what you were so considerate to tell me this morning. That the signorina perhaps she is a little hungry. For you the sandwich. Oh... now isn't that sweet? How thoughtful. - Wait till he warms up in the second gear. - He must be in reverse. - Here you go. - Oh, do I work tomorrow? Yes, you pose for the Jacky Carr Nautical outfit. Meet the male model at 10:00 on board the Enchantress off Glen Head Yacht Club. Well, what's this? Cookie, look what the baron brought you. - Oh, for me? - Scusi, signorina, I do not know if the young lady she is interested in something like this. Not interested in something from Carthay? It is the egg form the seamew of Patagonia. It's 12:00. I wonder when that beau hunk of yours is going to pose with you. What's the idea waking me up? I was just dreaming I owned this tub. Who is the office sending, do you know? Male models all look alike to me. Million-dollar profiles, and dollar-and-a-quarter brains. Yeah. Psst! Now I've got to soft-soap that guy. Shh! Close the door. Now, Mr. Murphy, you recall our understanding. Sure, fifty bucks to you for letting us use the boat. Shh! If my master were to find out that I accepted an emolument, I'd lose my position. Why, Mr. Philbean, you're not afraid, a smart guy like you. Well, I suppose I'm as shrewd as the next, you know. However, I was to be paid in advance, as I understood it. Yeah, you understood it alright. You son of a pirate. Moreover, Mr. Murphy, you were to be off this boat by half-past eleven. If my master should come aboard... I'll bet you got him right in your hip pocket. I'll bet he couldn't get along without you. Well, that's true, I do help him out of entanglements. He's a bit on the reckless side. - Oh, wine, women and song, eh? - Oh, no, he's not at all musical. But he has a deplorable habit of suggesting to ladies... ...they look well across the breakfast table. And they're prone to take him seriously. What are those, mementos? Reminders. Well, any guy that's sap enough to let himself in for a breach of promise suit oughta... Don't hurry, Apollo! There, that's that model I'm waiting for. Take your time, you're only an hour late. What did you think you're invited for, afternoon tea? I'll bet you didn't get your alarm clock out of hock. - Who's on board? - I don't know, sir. So glad you could come. How did you leave the dear, dear duchess? Well, it's about time you were here. We've only been waiting for you since ten o'clock. Right there. Now stay right where you are, Cookie. And, um... put your arm around her. And look at her. - Well. - Quiet, monkey, and hold it. Alright, I got it. Say... all right if I smoke now? Go ahead if you think you're so hot. Anything else you'd like to know? Certainly. Where you live. And who you live with. An incidentally, what makes you tick. I don't. And incidentally, I don't like your line. Oh, I like everything about you. Specially the way your nose turns up. That's high enough for now. Hey, look. - We're here to take pictures. - Oh, yeah... Now look, Cookie, you go over and get on the rail. And you go over and stand by her, sailor boy. Alright, hold it there, Bozo. - It's a pleasure. - Oh! Excuse me. Alright, Cookie, that's the spot. Now look a little to the left. That's it. Now eyes this way... a little sparkle in them. All right. Hey, whats-your-name, I told you to hold her there. The name's Smith. Are you sure it isn't Locksmith? I got it. Let's go over here. Can I help you down? Thank you. Hm, you're welcome. You sit in the chair, Cookie. And you drape yourself over the back and make it snappy. We don't want to get caught by the guy that owns this tub. Hm, not a bad tub. I wonder what the guy's like that owns it. I bet he's got a thick waist, thin hair, a high voice and a low brow. Just the same I'd like to meet him. Well, maybe if you're very nice to me, I can arrange it. And maybe you can arrange for him to fall for my style of beauty too. - And if he does? - I'll marry him. - On sight, on seeing? - If he has plenty of money. - Oh. - Hey, wait a minute. Get back there. Look... put your arm around her. And, Cookie, give me a little of the business, you know, eye to eye and... ...just one notch outside of a kiss. She gets the idea. That's it, closer. Closer. That's the stuff. Alright, that's all for today, let's go. Whoopie! Um... say, um... Cookie! Put that thing away. Be careful, sir, you don't know anything about her. We're even, she doesn't know who I am either. Make sure she doesn't find out. Hey, wait for me. Oh, we left Smitty, how will he get back? Oh, the way he came. Or let him walk back. Dining anywhere tonight? I know that one. If I don't, I'll be hungry tomorrow. Here! Save it for me. And don't be surprised if you see me at 7:30. You know, I wouldn't be surprised to find that guy in my soup. Philbean, she's wonderful! - Who is she? - I don't know, sir, I... - Where'd she come from? - Well, you see, sir, I... I... - Well, how'd she get on board? - Well, sir, you see... Who sent her, what's the name of the agency? - Well, I... I... - Don't you know anything? - No, sir, yes, sir, I know something. - What's the name of the firm? Oh... the name of the firm, sir, yes... - My cigarettes... - The name of the firm, sir, is... What's that? Ah, Phoelix Advertising Company. Philbean, I love you. Phoelix Advertising Company. No, he's gone for the day. Now, I thought I told you to get out of here. Anyone ever tell you you'd look swell across a breakfast table? Yes, and I laughed so hard, I fell right off my tricycle. Now, I've told you we don't give out the home numbers of our models. Phoelix Advertising Company. Oh, hello, Baron. This is Gwen. You bet, she'll be right down. Um, Mrs. Hoofnagle, the baron is downstairs with his car. Well, how long do I have to stay cooped up in here? Oh, it won't be long now, just give me 31 and a half seconds left. Well, that's all for today, sonny. You can either go through the door or the window. Of course the window has its poise. You get a little glimpse of the Hudson as you pass the 39th floor. All right, I can take a hint. Just tell me her right name. I told you we don't give out the names of our models. Hello, Phoelix Advertising Company. Oh, Mr. Radsen. Jackie Tarr called up. He said the pictures taken on the yacht were NG. The male model smelled them up. I didn't see them, but Murphy said they were such turkeys he tore up the negatives. Wait a minute, this may be Murphy now. No, it isn't. Hiya, darling. Now what do you want? Please come back. I just can't stand living without you. And I can't stand living with you. So run away. Both of you. What? Run away with a strange man? I'd rather die. Well, that suits me, but die outside. And that goes for you too. Oh, now, beautiful. Yes, I know, the same old axle grease. - Are you working? - Well, I... Now, don't tell me. You haven't got a job because you haven't got a camera. And you haven't got a camera because you pawned it. - Well, you see... - You don't mind if I stop you again... ...because I've heard that one too. You had to eat. And they don't hand out free lunch unless you buy a drink. Ah, you've seen each other across a breakfast table. Now you keep out of this, sonny, this is just for grown-ups. I suppose if you had a camera, you'd go to work? Oh, sweets, of course I would. Here you are, cameraman. I went soft and promoted one. Now don't come back until you get a job. And keep it... for at least a week. Go on, beat it. Both members of the alimony club? Listen if you want to know who I am, I'm Cookie's sister. Oh, glad to know you. My name's Smith. I knew there was something different about you. I'll let you in on a secret. I use Honeysuckle mouthwash. That kissable preparation. What an optimist. Now listen, I'm gonna tell you a little secret. Cookie's got a boyfriend and he doesn't have to use honeysuckle mouthwash. And what's more, he's got something in the bank. He's the kind of a guy who can take care of her. Say, I'm no cripple. Well, you stand an awfully good chance of making it if you don't scram. Oh, um... isn't that a beautiful pin. Hm, I knew you'd get around to seeing my fine points. Come on, just tell me when she'll work again. Oh, sure I will, three weeks from next Saturday. Thanks. I'll wait. - Oh! - Rather regrettable, miss. I'm afraid we're marooned here forty-three stories above the Third Thoroughfare. - Hello. - Oh, it's you. - I told you not to be surprised. - That's not the word for it. I'm a little early for our appointment, but we can... - Here it is. - Oh, thanks. - Shall I hold it while we have dinner? - I have a dinner engagement. There's somebody waiting downstairs for me in a car. Yes, Mrs. Hoofnagle, I know all about that. If you're so fond of driving, we could go for a spin in the Park. That's fine, you just run right over to the Park and spin yourself. And don't come spinning around here. - I think too much of my job. - Oh, that's a big mistake. A girl like you could do much better. Oh, I wouldn't give up my work for the world. You meet such interesting people. Have I mentioned that you're very cute? And have I mentioned that you're heaven's gift to a breakfast table? Will you let me pass without making a scene? I don't think you'de like the view of the Hudson as you pass the 39th floor. - Down, going down! - It's not working. - Devil this unemployment! - Going up! - Going down. - Hey! Get out of the way! Say, you forgot to give me the address. Congratulations, sir, for a narrow escape. Go on, go on, get out! And don't come back, because I don't want to buy a camera. (Both) Say, I want to talk to you. - You know Cookie. - And you like her. Wanna buy a camera? - How did you guess? - It's Lexington 22089. - Thanks. - I'll be seeing you. - 22098. Philbean! - Yes, sir. - Congratulate me. - Congratulations, sir. - Philbean, I've got an idea. - What's that, sir? - You've been promoted. - Yes, sir, I am now witness for the defense. You are now President of the Philbean Advertising Agency. No! No, I tell you, no! I don't want to be annoyed with trifles. Have the contracts ready for the young lady to sign. Spoken like a president. Now, then, what's your first lesson for today? Lesson? Didn't I tell you I'm not to be Richard Stuyvesant Smith, just plain Dick Smith? This is one time I'm not going to pay through the nose. - Right, yes. - Now remember. You've got three points. - Three p... - No, don't tell me, don't tell me, I know! Three points, yes, I know. Um, point... yes, three points. Point A, um... - Offer the young lady a job. - Correct. - At $15 a week. - A day, a day! Oh, a day, sorry, a day, yes. Offer the young lady a job at $15 a day... Hm... Offer the young lady a job at $15 a w... a day... And... Oh, paper, yes, the contract for the young lady to sign, yes. - Of course, sir. - What's that word "sir"? Remember, I'm working for you. Yes, quite, well... Since you're working for me, Smith, do you mind removing your feet from my desk? Hello, are you there? - Wh-who is this? - The other one. - Hello? - It's that one. - Hello... what? - That one! Oh, yes, that's right. Hello? Hello? Here, give me that! - It's the other one. - The other one? - The switch. - Oh the switch, which switch? The switch, the second switch. Second... hello... hello, switch. Which switch... Hello, are you there? Oh, of course you're there, we're all here. All of us... all... yes... Who is that? Oh, yes... that's Miss Cooke. That's Miss Cooke, yes. Yes, send her right in. Wait a minute, why don't you give me a chance to get out of here? Well, I don't know, sir. I'm sorry but it seems to me... that I have a distinct recollection of your saying to me definitely... that she... that, that er... Now remember, $15 a day and sign the papers. - Oh, yes, of course, the papers. - And don't get nervous, Philbean. Mr. Philbean to you! Oh, Miss Cooke, come right in! - How do you do? - How do you do? - This is my sister, Mrs. Mayen. - Oh, how do you do, indeed. My name is Philbean, I'm in the advertising business. Me too, but I've never heard of that name. It's an odd name, isn't it? Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Will you take a seat too? Oh, excuse me just one moment. A little spot of powder. I find a silk kerchief removes it instantly from gentlemen's lapels. - I mean, my lapel. - Bragging. Now, Miss Cooke, there are three things I've got to remember. I... I mean, there are three things I've got to say. Yes. Now the first is, um... The, um... Oh, will you have a footstool? Thank you. Not at all... oh, excuse me. A little dust. Yes... Now the first is, um... Will you have a footstool... a little dust, I think, yes... - And the second is, um... - Will you have a drink. Yes... no! Well, I don't mind. Why not? - Oh, are you a bottle baby? - I beg your pardon? - I mean, um... do you bend the elbow? - Well, occasionally on my days off. I mean, on my off days. Mr. Philbean, I understand you wanted to see me about a job. I suppose you've had a look at my stills. Your stills, oh, yes, um... Oh... yes, but you see, miss, your face would enhance the value of any merchandise you portray. Now tell me, how much emolument are you in the habit of receiving? Well, she doesn't stand for much of it. Well, what are you willing to pay? Well, to you, my dear Miss Cooke, $15 a week. Well now, aren't you big-hearted, I bet you drink that much up in a day. Oh, a day, a day, exactly, that's what I meant, $15 a day. $15 a day? - Yes, well... let's make it $20 a day. Twenty dollars a day? Very well, then, we'll make it $25 a day. Twenty-five dollars a day? Why, that's a lot of money. It's a lot of grog if you ask me. Come on. Oh, please don't go, there's something else I want to say. Miss Cooke, I want to tell you that you'd look swell across a... a magazine cover. Hm, she'll look swell in court trying to get you to remember that you said $25 a day. And now look, Mr. Philbean, with me a job is a job, and it's got to be impersonal. So you'd better peddle your papers elsewhere. Oh, paper, that's it, paper. Yes, there's a contract for you to sign. A contract? Yes, yes, now, if you'll just be good enough to step this way, we'll have the whole thing set right to the trimmings. What a screwy outfit. Everybody that works for it. That goes for you too, Smitty. Good morning. Ah, there we are, Miss Cooke, good morning. Here we go. - What are you shooting? - Eighty-eight's in a good course. No, I mean, Honeysuckle mouthwash advertisement. - I'm really waiting for our new male model. - Male model. I've never met one yet that knew what time it was. Did I meet one the other day on a yacht that was really a turkey. A turkey, you don't say. Yes, I don't know how the company ever came to hire him. Well, maybe they were trying to sell cranberries. Well, who left the back door open? - You've met Mr. Smith, of course. - Oh, yes, I've met Smitty. - I'd hoped for the last time. - Didn't your sister tell you? Oh, yes, she told me I was going to get a very pleasant surprise. Mr. Smith talked so much of you. He actually made me feel Philbean Inc. couldn't possible exist without you. - Oh, really. - So let we proceed, shall we not? This way Miss Cooke. Sit down here, Miss Cooke. - Allow me. - Thank you. Did he mean you got me this job? - How come? - Oh, I've got a drag with the old boy. Here, here! Sit down next to her, young fellow. I hope you got yourself $25 a day for this. - Not exactly. - Oh, it's a cinch, he, um... And then you can get anything out of him. Just speak up. Now, children, please look happy. Splendid. Wait a minute, that's not right. We should be closer together. - Like this. - I am giving the orders... Smitty! Now, wait a minute, don't get him mad. That's not a way to get a raise. - Now look here, take hold of that. - Um, Mr. Philbean, Mr. Smith is thinking of quitting. Oh, really? I hardly think so. Oh, yes, he's got a better offer. Oh, that's fine. I can secure droves of turkey gobblers. Don't worry, I'll get it for you. You mean you'd really go to bat for me? Well, you were nice to get me my job. Anyway, you're such a nitwit, you need a manager. Hold that! That's good! Now, look as though you're serenading her. Say, how would you like to be serenaded? Do I have to stand for that too? Well, you don't have to, but it might be wise to encourage me. Stay where you are, Miss Cooke. # Whisper in my ear # # Words I long to hear # # Will you? # # Tell me that you might # # Thrill me with delight # # Will you? # # Admire me, inspire me # # And let me see you desire me # # Let my devotion and genuine emotion # # Thrill you # # Will you? # # Blend your lips to mine # # For a little time # # Will you? # # Silently consent, signify content # # Will you? # # Without alarm believe me # # With open arms receive me # # And when I leave you here # # Wish that I were near # # Will you? # No. You know, a fellow could really go places if he had a girl like you to look at... ...across the breakfast table. That will do! You mean that's all for today? That will be all for today. Um... I'll tell you what. We'll blow in my raise on a dinner, hm? We will not, you stay home and save your money. Besides, I have a standing date. - Every night? - Well, every night I'm not working. You'd better tell Miss Cooke if you want her to work any nights, she, um... She has a standing date. Oh, but I wouldn't dream of interfering with your social engagements. You young people go right ahead and have a good time. - Oh, thank you. - Yes. You idiot! The date's with another guy. - But, sir, I thought... - What with? - But, sir, you winked, I thought... - Oh, go bury your head in the sand. - Isn't it a honey? - Uh-huh. Gosh, can you imagine sending costumes like this up to the house? One look at your boss and I can imagine anything. Even sending this furniture up here. Yeah. My, how they must miss him at the booby coop. Oh, gosh, there's the baron now. Oh, gee, Gwen, I wish I could wear this dress out tonight. Why don't you? Your boss will never know, he's too full of emolument. I'm coming. - Hello, gorgeous. - You're out of luck, the bank is closed. Oh, sweets, I just dropped around to see how you girls were making out. We're not! Look, I'm broke and Cookie's all washed up at Phoelix. But, beautiful... Oh! Hiya, Cookie. - Got any new boyfriend? - Yeah, the sheriff. Beat it! Gee, honey, I don't see why you're always so anxious to get rid of me. What's she all dolled up for, Frankenstein? Oh! - Here. Blow yourself to an exit. - Thanks. - I'll be seeing you. - Hm, take your time. Again! Well, I didn't want him to think you were going around with a millionaire... ...even though the baron does like eggs. What do you mean going around? Where does he ever take me? Oh, here... I hope that's the baron. You'll spoil your appetite, you're going out to dinner. - I hope. - You are, I told him to take you. Yes, you told him once before. He'll probably come in tonight... ...with a package of after-dinner mint. You beat it and make an entrance. Signora, I am here! I have fly all the way. Come right in and take a load off your wings. Cookie'll be here in a minute. Now, where are you two lovebirds fluttering to? I hope the signorina will dishonor the Vandevere Hotel. The Vandevere, hm! That's the best dinner show in town. - Do you like dancing? - Ah, the dance! When the music she starts, I am like the falcon. You mean you're all up in the air. My feet should never once touch the ground. What becomes of your partner? - Cookie, dear, the baron's here. - I'll be out in a minute. - Here, here, here, now what's this? - Shh! You tell me the signorina she is interested in the beautiful, the rare, the unaccustomary. - So you brought her another egg. - Oh, no, signora! This, this is a magnificent canary. Well, if I were you, I wouldn't let Cookie see it. Oh, but signora, you think she does not like this canary? - Good evening, Baron. - Madonna mia. How you are beautiful! - Like the long-tailed chickadee. - Yes, calling to its mate. Oh, excuse me. Now, you two chickadees have a nice time tonight. Isn't she adorable? - Hello? - This is Mr. Philbean speaking. I'm afraid it'll be necessary for you to work tonight. And every night. But you said you wouldn't need me. Unfortunately circumstances have arisen... ...which may require your presence every night, possibly. - Not possibly. - I mean probably. - Not probably! - Positively. - What? - I said I'd give her the message. This is her sister speaking. Miss Cooke left some time ago for the Vandevere Hotel. Well, what is it? What's wrong? - She's gone out. - Out where? - To the Vandevere Hotel. - Good! That's just where we're going. My, isn't it a small world. - Now you boys know what to do. - Yes, sir. I'll let you know when the young lady comes in. If I may coin a phrase, sir, she is here. They have marvelous food here, Baron. - S?, s?. We're going up, she's over here. - But the dining room... On the mezzanino is the wonderful egg show. Egg show? Oh, I thought you said wonderful leg show. Oh, s?, s?, marvelous egg show. I hope you already have had a good dinner, for perhaps the lecturer she is a bit lately. There's a gentleman to see you, Mr. Arbuckle. Oh, here is no Mr. Arbuckle. Here is the Baron Torini. Oh, I beg your pardon, Baron Torini. - Paging Baron Torini, paging Baron Torini. - Ragazzo! The Baron Torini, I am speaking. You're wanted on the phone, Baron. Right this way, please. Scusi, signorina, I return with the wings of the dove. On toast. Hello! Hello, operation! Who is it calling the Baron Enrico Raffaelo Victorio Torini? - Miss Cooke, Miss Frances Cooke! - Yes? This way, please, Miss Cooke. Nobody? Hm, I fix hims nobody! - Here you are, Miss Cooke. - Good evening, Miss Cooke. Oh, Mr. Philbean. We're a little late but we'll set up right here. Oh, but I have an engagement and... - Is that food? - Hello! Looks like we're going to be working day and night. Why speak of work when there's food in the air? Remember there were some things I wanted to find out about you? And the answer to them all is caviar. Wait a minute, you're ahead of me. As I was saying... - I found out where you lived. - And with whom I lived, my sister. Hm, that can be changed. As I was saying... I know who you'll have dinner with, me. - And luncheon, me. - And breakfast, my sister. Don't interrupt. Where was I? Oh, yes, there's one thing I'm still trying to find out. If you put that same effort into getting somewhere. Oh, I'm not doing so badly, only... What I really want to know is... Have you read any good books lately? Is that you, Gwen? Well now, what are you made up of, the spirit of housework? Now, you're not really dusting. Hm-hmm, I thought I'd give you a hand tonight. Well, you keep your hands for other things. Honest toil never gave anybody that skin you like to photograph. What are you doing home anyway? Oh, we got the evening off. Smitty's coming up. Oh, and you're the gal that was going to marry dough. I am. And the first night you get off you don't tell the baron you date up this grasshopper. Well, after all, he did get me the job. Oh, he sent up some flowers. Um, Gwen... I thought maybe you'd like to go to a picture tonight They've got good features down the street. Yes, and so does the boy model, but that's all he has got. - Remember that. - Oh, I just feel sorry for him. The poor kid's awfully lonely. Hm, nice going. Next thing you'll be holding his head. And then he'll tell you that you remind him of his mother. I can see the handwriting on the wedding cake. - What's the baron's number? - What for? I think I'll drop in and see if I can step on his accelerator. These imported machines are tough to start. But once I get my foot on the gas, I bet he crashes right through this door with a proposal. Now wait a minute. Don't you dare bring him up here tonight. Just because I made a crack about marrying dough. Oh, it was just a crack, eh? No. But does it have to be him, does it have to be in the next five minutes? Honey, there's to time like five minutes before it's too late. - But, Gwen... - Good evening. Oh, for the love of Pete. Could I interest you in a few gadgets for the modern home? What are toy doing, moving in? Now what have you got there? Just a few tidbits in case we're hemmed in by the enemy and the food supply's cut off. - Now, you ought to be spanked. - She wouldn't go out to dinner with me. You know why, because I didn't want you to spend your money. Now look at this. A flivver has to make a lot of noise or you wouldn't notice it, but a loud horn doesn't make anybody think it's an imported car. Still, it does help when you're passing the imported car. - Oh, I hope I'm not driving you out. - Oh, no, no, not at all. I've got to see a man about an accelerator. Well, now that you know where we are, you must come to see us often. Not often, honey, but soon. - Hello. - I'm very sorry too. - What's the idea of all this? - Well, it's sort of a memory test. I think you said you liked fruit candy, red roses, walnuts and grapes. They're very nice. But I'd like it lots better if you remembered the size of your pay envelope. Well, it just goes to show what you can do on ten bucks a day. My father used to say a smart man knows that money can buy anything, so he doesn't have to prove it. Well, mine used to say money makes the mayor go for you. Now, seriously, Dick, don't you ever think of the future? Not when the present is like this. Yeah, that's right. Put that thing away. I'm sufficiently impressed. - With what? - The fact that you're the domestic type. Kind of a little woman who makes a home for a man. Don't worry, I'm not. And what's more, I'm not the type to marry a guy that needs the type. I've finished my dusting for the year. - Then hows about taking off the hood? - Oh, for the love of Pete! You know, that's what makes you bald, keeping your head covered. Thanks. My barber says I won't have a hair left when I'm forty. - Why? - Don't worry, I'm saving them for a toupee. Why, you've got wonderful hair if only you'd take proper care of it. For instance. Well, if you stop eating those things you remembered I liked, Il'l show you. How? This way! Free demonstration of Cookie's policoncoction. Grows grass on golf balls, sample on request. Take off your coat. - What for? - Don't ask questions. Take off your tie. And open your shirt. Come on! Come on in here. - What's the big idea? - Now, sit down here. - Oh, now, wait a minute. - Come on! Come on, this will hurt Mother just much worse than it will you. Look, I was only kidding. - My hair isn't falling out. - Well, I'll make sure it won't. Well, I'll stand for anything but a hairnet. This stuff will nail your hair right into your scalp. What is that stuff? Smells just like it looks. - Mange cure. - Mange cure! - It won't bite. - Now wait a minute. I'll do it for you just this once and you can take it home and use it. - Myself? - No, have your valet do it. Oh! - Hot? - It's scalding! That's alright, a hot towel's like love, it doesn't stay hot forever. - Better? - Well, I can stand it now. - That's good. - Oh! Don't be such a baby. Did your father do it like this? - Not exactly. - I bet he soaked you plenty. Oh, I don't know. I think I'm usually a little drier. Hey! Look what's happening! Keep your shirt on. Oh, no, I guess you'd better take it off. Here, turn around and close your eyes. I'll take it off for you. - I've had lots of experience. - Hm? With the neighbors' children. Oh. Never mind my shirt, it's my face I can't send to the laundry. Yes, I know, and your shirt isn't your fortune. - Say, how long... - Now listen, sit still, hold still... ...and keep your mouth shut. - Can't I even say argh... - There, that's better! Here now, put this over your eyes. This around here. Oh, I have to do everything. What's that one? Is this stuff a remedy? No, green soap. Green never was my color. Hey! How do you expect me to entertain you if you're gonna bash my brains out? I'll pick up anything that spills with a medicine dropper. Sit tight a minute. I hate getting water in my ears. Soup too, I'll bet. Any other complaints? Yeah, the back of my neck. Say, how long do I have to hold it like this? What are you doing anyway? Where are you? Getting into something dry. - Get something in your eye? - Almost, but the soap intefered. Here, take this, it'll be alright. Just think about something else, your father's toupee. Oh, I gotta tell you about that, it was the funniest thing... Save it for later. - I tell you it's too hot. - What? - I said it's hot! - I told you to save it for later! I said it's too hot! Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to tell me about your father's toupee. - Say, how much longer... - It's clean now. Did I ever tell you about my old man's toupee? It was the funniest thing. I... I... Oh, that's wonderful. Hmm, that makes me feel just like a ship riding at anchor. Hm, that's the most beautiful sight in the world. - What, a toupee? - Hm? No, I was talking about a... a... A... hm... Forget it. You're sweet. That's what I like best about you. Hm... You know, I never had a girl mother me before. When a girl mothers you, it means something. It means she really cares. I guess that's what makes you different from the lightweights I've known. You take an interest in a man. And it gives him a different slant on... Hey, Cookie! All finished with the job? Will I get any ointment? Gee, my barber always rubs in a lot of... Anything wrong, honey? No, I just think you'd better go home. Home? Say, you're a fine kind of a hostess. - Come on, sit down here. - Please. Go home. What got into you all of a sudden? - Did I do anything? - No. Don't ask a lot of questions, I'm just tired. - Oh. - Here. Well, look, honey, if you're tired, you just lie down... No! Well... That's a fine way to treat a fellow who comes up here full of the best intentions. Well, here are your intentions. I didn't touch them anyway. Now, honey, don't be like that. You don't really... And here are your grapes. You started them you can finish them. - Home! - Gee, you're quiksilver. One minute you're on, the next minute you're off. Well, from now on, I'm off. - Good night. - I'll see you tomorrow? Maybe you'll be on again... on the job, I mean. Get out, get out, I tell you! I never want to see you again, no matter how many jobs it costs me. Taxi! Taxi! - Here, sir! - Philbean, what are you doing here? Well, sir, I thought you might need me... ...in case you found yourself at the breakfast table. Conversationally, I mean. I didn't expect you so soon, sir. - Something went wrong. - Yes, it usually does. We were really having fun. She had my head in the basin... An old American custom? Now remember. Plenty of romance. And no eggs. Have no fear. From me comes not one more egg. Don't even mention a bird's nose. Cookie! Oh, Cookie! I got the accelerator oiled up. Oh. And he's just dying to tell you something. Signorina, I have the misfortune to find you at home. And I have bring you, I have bring you a little surprise. Oh, um, we don't need any eggs until breakfast. Why don't you tell her that little idea you had, you know about, um... ...seeing Niagara Falls. Oh, s?, s?. But in this box she gives a real canary. Oh, and you told me you were all set to sweep her off her feet. Well, blow me down, it's a headlight. Oh, no, signora, she's a real canary diamond. Well, whatever she is, she's a bird. - Look! - Signorina. My heart she is beating against the cage of my breast. Feel! Do you know what she is saying? It is the season of the mating. The time for the building of the nest. He means will you marry him. Well, it's so sudden, I'm... I'm not sure. She means she will. Oh, che dolcezza d'essere con il mio amore! Don't stop, don't stop, go right ahead, go right ahead. I tuoi occhi sono come le stelle del cielo. Bon jour, baby! - - - Adiosay! Just a little foreigner I'm putting through college. Do you think you were wise in coming back and putting your head in the lion's basin? I mean... Something's wrong and I'm going back and find out what it is. Hiya, going up to see Cookie? Well, she's got company, and he's got dough. And he gave her a ring, and they're gonna be married. Oh. Well, I'll be seeing you. Well, why not? She said she was going to marry money. Well, that's that. Wait a minute. That's not right. She can't be in love with that fellow, she must be in love with me. Isn't that rather carrying the wish to the well, sir? She must be in love with me, or I wouldn't be feeling this way. You mean delirious? Well, then I must be feeling this way because... I'm in love with her. Um, shall I set the breakfast table for two in the morning, sir? Philbean! I can prove she's in love with me. Come on! - Oh, give me a nickel. - A nickel. Yeah, a dime, a quarter, anything. Here, get on the phone. - Get on the phone from here? - Get on the phone, do as I tell you. - Call Cookie. - Hello, Cookie, Cookie, hello! - Dial it! - Oh, dial it? Oh, yes... let's see... I know what it is... Wh-what will I tell her? Tell her I've attempted suicide and I'm dying. - But you're not dying. - Go on, go on! Tell her I'm hovering between life and death. - But you're not hov... - At the Vandevere Hotel. Hovering, you're not hovering. Don't you understand? If you tell her that and she comes dashing out of that door? - Then I'll know she loves me. - Yes, but, sir, the... the... Oh, wait a minute, I... Yes... he-hello, is that Cookie? Oh, hello, Mr. Philbean. Miss Cookie. Mr. Smith is hovering between life and death. He shot himself in the Vandevere Hotel. Hello! Hel-hello! - What is it? - He's sick. - What's he done now? - He's hovering between life and death. I knew it! Vandevere Hotel, hurry! I was right, she loves me! She's gone to me, she thinks I'm dying. Yes, sir, but what will she think when she finds you're not at the Vandevere. That you never attempted suicide. Holy jumping caterpillar, come on! Vandevere Hotel, don't spare the horses! Step on it, make it snappy! Oh, hurry, hurry! I say! Can't you go faster? We've passed her! I want a room, pal! I'm sorry, sir, filled up, convention in town. - I'll pay you a hundred. - I know, sir... - Two hundred! - I know, but... - I'll pay anything! - We have no rooms, sir. - Oh, excuse me! - Shh! Sorry. Hey! This'll do. You go down to the lobby and bring her up when she arrives. This is room 216, hurry up! - Up, sir. - No, down, go down! Down. - Where is he? - Come with me. - How is he? - Worse, I think. It's a matter of touch and go. Oh, I must have left the door unlocked. What the blazes are you doing in here? - Excuse me! - Well, get out! I'm out! Hello! Hello! Hello! - Hurry, hurry! - 216, 216. - Where is he? - 216, that's 218. There he is! Oh, I beg your pardon! - That's not... - I... I... I... Where is he? Dick! Oh, you're alive! He's alive! Oh, you did shoot yourself, didn't you? - Get a doctor! - No, no doctor. I want to marry you before it's too late. I'll do anything, anything, but don't leave me! - You don't care if I haven't got a nickel? No! No! Oh, that's fine. I don't care if I never have a fur coat or anything. What was that? Mice. I'm terribly sorry to intrude, but you must come with me. Wait! What... what... what... I'm awfully sorry, but it's a matter of life and death. The gentleman's name is Richard Stuyvesant Smith and the lady is Frances Cooke. - Oh, Dick, we're going to be married. - This is most irregular! You'll let a man pass away without being married? Carry on! Hurry! Hurry! Do you, Richard Stuyvesant Smith, - take this woman... - Yes, yes, of course he does! Who's the one getting married? ...as your lawfully wedded wife? Yes, yes! To live together in a state of matrimony? Will you love... I shall report this to the Governor of the State of New York! Oh, hurry, hurry, the man's dying! Carry on! - Will you love, honor, and keep her... - Yes, yes, yes! There's a lunatic been running around here with blood over his face. - Blood? Oh... - Where is he? I don't know, he busted into my room and nearly scared my wife to death! By the laws of the State of New York... Silence, please! It's a matter of life and death. Carry on. I pronounce you husband and wife! Oh, darling, darling! Ketchup. Sorry I haven't got the steak to go with it. Ketchup? My, what a small world. Oh, wise guy, eh? Come on! - Why, that's Richard Stuyvesant Smith. - Well, he's still a wise guy. I'll say he is. He owns this hotel. - Owns this hotel? - Yep. And a yacht, fur coats, and anything else you want. Oh, Smitty! My, what a small world. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
