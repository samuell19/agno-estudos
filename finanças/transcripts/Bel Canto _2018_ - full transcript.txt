I'm honored to be here, Mr. Vice President. Thank you, sir. And please, I say my apology that the president was unable to attend. He was called into some talks with Israel. [speaking Japanese] Mr. Hosokawa understands that affairs of state must take precedence. He's a mere businessman. Oh, no, no, no. And tomorrow I would like to show you to some potential building sites for a Nansei factory. Si. [chuckles] S; This is Monsieur and Madame Ambassador of France Thibault. - What a pleasure. - Enchante. Nice to meet you. And thank you for the presence of this amazing talent. Arigato [Japanese]. [speaking Japanese] Mr. Hosokawa is grateful for the chance to hear Ms. Coss in such an intimate setting. It is the opportunity of a lifetime. The flight? It was a long and bumpy. And there are soldiers everywhere, waving their guns around. It's absolutely terrifying. So Italy, England, United States. I mean it. Italy, England, United States for the next year at least. Not even Teatro Colon. No, I don't care. I don't care how much they pay. [knock at door] Hang on. Yes? They're ready. Uh, right, they're... They're ready. I'll call you back. 0K, bye. [sighs] Good. Let's get this over with. [speaking Spanish] In my country, opera is a sacred thing. So to... [applause] [speaking Spanish] 0h, gracias. You look lovely. Good evening. Thank you, Miss Coss. - Hola. - Hello. Mr. Hosokawa, may I present Ms. Roxanne Coss? It is a great pleasure. Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine. So I understand you would like to hear Rusalka? [speaking Japanese] He enjoyed hearing you sing it in Vienna. Thank you. Uh, [speaking Japanese] If a human soul should dream of me, may he still remember me on awaking. Well, that's a poetic thought. I will finish my program with it. [speaking Japanese] You know it's Little Mermaid. Yes. But it's opera, so in the end, everybody dies. [laughs] Shall we? Let's begin.

I'm with International Committee of the Red Cross. I'm unarmed. [speaking Spanish] [breathes heavily] Are you sure you want to come in? Because there's no guarantee they're going to let you out. They will let me out. More hostages is not what they're looking for now. In! [speaking Spanish] [g u n cocks] Who are you? Messner. I'm Swiss. I speak a little English. My comrades do not. I have a translator outside. No, no one else. We have a translator. Wait. Translator! [speaking Japanese] You will translate? English? French? Do you have a preference? [speaking Japanese] No preference. What we want, of course, is the unconditional release of all the hostages. Unharmed. [speaking Spanish] Send in President Masuda. They came for the president and will release everyone in exchange for him. They won't give you the president. That's who we came here for. Well, I came here on vacation to relax. It seems like no one is going to get what they want. Someone needs to sew up that cut. I'm going to call in a medic. No! No medics! No sewing. MAN ON FLOOR: [breathing heavily] It was never a pretty face anyway. Nothing will proceed if this man bleeds to death. [speaking Spanish] Is there a doctor here? There must be a doctor. [groans] [speaking Spanish] We only have five minutes. Don't worry. I'm trained at first aid. [heavy breathing] One, two. [clip] [shouts] I'm sorry. [speaking Spanish] [breathes heavily] Ah, no.

The second one is to be read to the press... Our demands. "All political prisoners held in the government's illegal jails must be freed." - All of them. - All of them. [speaking Spanish] GEN: They are their brothers and sisters. They are prepared to die for them. No one has to die. Well, we all have to someday. But as far as right now, it is up to the government. If there is blood, it will be on their hands. [speaking Spanish] We ask you all to stand up and approach, please. [speaking german] [speaking french] [speaking german] The women to the far right of the room, men to the far left. [speaking Spanish] [sniffles] [speaking Spanish] [inaudible]. [speaking Spanish] What's wrong with you? Insulin. My insulin is back at the hotel. You're diabetic? Yeah. We need help! This man is sick. He's sick. He needs medicine. OK. OK, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. No, it's not. Come on. [speaking Spanish] OK, OK, OK, OK. [speaking Spanish] Oh! Oh! [speaking Spanish] All right, we're going to move out now. Women first. Follow me. [speaking Spanish] MESSNER: Calm and quiet. Everything's going to be all right. Move on. Let's go. [Spanish] [kisses] Hey! [screams] Remain calm. Move on. What»- what are you doing? We're all going to get out. Remain calm. Ah. You OK? It's OK, it's OK. Go in the bus. Go in the bus! Please, go into the bus! Thank you. - All in the bus. - Where's Roxanne? [speaking french] Hey, hey, hey! She's not outside! Roxanne Coss is not outside! Roxanne! Where is she? Roxanne! [gunshot] [gasps] No! [speaking Spanish] Let me back in! Let me back in! Call an ambulance! 0K. It's OK. It's OK. You're OK. [groans] [speaking Spanish] Catholic? I... I... I don't know. I... I don't know. He's... he's Norwegian. I-I never asked him. - Catolica? - Me? Si, catolica. I was... I was brought up Catholic, but I»- I don't know about him. I just... I just work with him. I don't... You're giving him last rites? [speaking Spanish] [speaking Japanese] [cries] [speaking Spanish] [tranquil music playing] The singer has to come out now, Mr. Watanabe. [speaking Spanish] No! No, only if the president comes. You said all women. How can I continue negotiating if I cannot trust you? Listen, Red Cross. We are not on the same side. I never take sides. Then you are on the side of power. You're the one carrying a gun. You have the power in here, so let her go. Please. I said no. We need her now more than before. She stays. Hey. [speaking Spanish] Here's some antibiotics. You should take them. 0K. Gracias. I... I... I... I don't think they should have brought in the food like this. They could have made two separate trips out»- out of respect. They don't have any respect for anything or anyone. They're not human. I will try and get you out of here as soon as possible. Thank you. [speaking Spanish] [chatter] [sirens] [shouting in spanish] [SPEAKING SPANISH OVER LOUDSPEAKER] [speaking Spanish] My employer, Mr. Hosokawa, asks me to offer his condolences. He wanted me to tell you that your accompanist was very talented. That's very kind of him. Will you say his name for me again, your employer. Mister? Hosokawa. He feels responsible for all that's happening right now. No, he didn't shoot anyone. Mr. Hosokawa? Gen tells me you feel, in some way, responsible. You're not. [speaking Japanese] He came to hear you sing in exchange for building a factory here, which he never intended to do. [speaking Japanese] It was a vanity to accept a gift of a private concert by such a great artist. [speaking Japanese] He's always moved by your work. He's heard you sing at La Scala, London, and New York. He must love opera. Yeah. [speaking Japanese] GEN: For him, your voice is opera. [speaking Japanese] He feels responsible for your accompanist's death. No, no, no. No. Please, I sing at many, many private parties all over the world. With all due respect, I didn't come here to sing for you. I came because they paid me. [speaking Japanese] If anything, I'm to blame. I turned down this engagement several times till they came up with enough money. GEN: [speaking Japanese] [speaking Japanese] No, no, no, believe me, I am very capable of blame. I just don't blame you. GEN: [speaking Japanese] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Japanese] What is it? - Meat. - Ugh. No, no, no. Yeah, I could see that it's meat, but what kind is it? I don't know. It's probably better not to ask. [speaking Spanish] [opera music playing] [g u n cocks] [music box tinkling a tune] [clicking] [speaking Spanish] Gracias. [helicopter flying] [speaking Spanish] [shouting] [making shooting noises] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah! Pah! Pah, pah! [pipes rattle] [water flow stops] [speaking Spanish] [handles squeak] [speaking Spanish] No! Thank you. Gracias. The government has turned off the water to the house to make things more uncomfortable for us. Mm-hm. I gathered that. We need water. My comrade, Comandante Alfredo, wants to shoot someone just to show the government who is in charge. But I have another thought. What's that? I want you to sing. I want you to sing loudly enough that these animals outside can hear it. What good would that do? It might remind them what is at stake. Uh-ha. No. I won't sing. Not for you. [speaking Spanish] He says to do what you are told. Oh, or what? You'll shoot me? You've kept one woman, one American, una americana. If you shoot me, what do you think will happen to you and your people? I don't think I need to do what you say. Madame Coss, we will not last long here without water, but we will not surrender. We need to free our brothers and sisters. We here are all they have. So please, sing. When they hear the beauty of your voice, these government criminals, perhaps they will find a solution to our situation. Where'd you learn English? At university. I'm a teacher. I was a teacher. H istory. Once upon a time. I've never gone a week without singing unless I was sick. I'm going to have to start practicing soon. I just don't want to give them the satisfaction. Mr. Hosokawa, what do you think? You think I should sing? [speaking Japanese] He says your voice never belonged to them. Do either of you play the piano? Uh, no. When did you first listen to opera? [speaking Japanese] When he was a child, his father took him. And when did you start singing? Hm, I don't know. I don't remember. My mother said that I was always singing. [chuckles] Eh. Excuse me? Yes? Do you know how to play piano? Tell the Red Cross to send in a teacher, and I will learn for her. Oh, yes. Thank you. I would just sing, you know, all day and... and all night. It was like a language that I could speak. And then when I was seven, my mother found a teacher for me, and»- and that was it. Ah-ah. And what about you? Um, when did you, um, learn to do what you do? [speaking Japanese] Uh. I started engineer. Ah. Ah, OK. Did you draw that? [laughs] From window. Yes, yes, I'm very impressed. Monsieur Thibault? Oui. [speaking french] Yes. A little. [speaking Japanese] [PLAYS ENERGETIC TUNE ON THE PIANO] [laughs] [laughter] [applause and cheers] [siren] [speaking Spanish] Buenos d as. [inaudible] [speaking Spanish] Gracias. [police radio chatter] - You bought this? - What? You bought this? No, they gave it to me. And the news stations? They've been all alerted. [sighs] [speaking Spanish] Why are you helping them? Because you need water, and I don't want anyone else to get killed. [speaking Japanese] Hey! [speaking Spanish] Por favor. No. Mister, over here, please. [chatter] [megaphone crackles] [speaking Spanish] Don't shoot. Do not shoot. You sure they won't shoot? Not everyone likes opera. [speaking Spanish] Holy shit. I don't need that. No es bueno. [piano playing] [sings opera] [stops playing] [chatter] I want to start over. What happened? I haven't sung in a week. I would like to start over. Are you able to do it? Yes, if you stop talking. [speaking Spanish] [piano playing] [singing opera] [applause and cheers] That was one of the more unique concerts I've attended. [singing opera] [applause] How did I do? [REPORTER ON TV SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [applause on the tv] [pipes clanking] [water flows] [claps] [laughter] [gargling] [opera singing] Look at her, Gen. She's staring right at you. I would like to speak to her. You'll be my translator. Do you speak Spanish? He's quite good at it. [speaking Spanish] MAN: Carmen! Nice asking her about the music. [laughter] [speaking Spanish] Madame Coss. I want to say thank you for your help. Well, if you'd really like to thank me, you could release me. And everyone else. I'm afraid I can't. But! Can give you some more comfortable accommodations. [sighs] [knock at door] Hola. Por favor. I sang for my supper, and this is my reward. Um, [Spanish] Carmen. Oh, Carmen. Um. Roxanne. [speaking Spanish] Gracias. This is nice. Oh, well. Um, it was nice... Nice talking to you. Adios, Carmen. Gracias. Shall we get Gen? What's in the box? Sheet music and lotion for Miss Coss. - Playing cards. - Mm. What the hell is going on? Are you CIA? [scoffs quietly] What are you? I'm an idiot! That's what I am. [speaking german] I'm just a fucking idiot spending his own life running back and forth between people with guns! You think I knew about this? You think they tell me anything? They tell me nothing. Find someone else. Just find someone else! [chatter in spanish] I found this in my room. I thought you might like it. Oh, no, no, I don't really know how, and I hate being bad at things. So you play. [speaking Japanese] [chuckles] Um. 51254.2 Um. [speaking Japanese] You're going to make me learn, aren't you? Queen. This is going to take forever. Yeah.

[Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Hm? Married you? Are you learning English? [Spanish]? Ah-ah. Bien. Well, I've been married twice. The first time I was very young, and the marriage lasted four months. The second time, I married my business manager. It was not a very good investment on my part. [brushing hair] But you know, I was so lonely. So. What about everybody else, do you think? How bout Mr. Hosokawa? Is he married? [speaking Japanese] - Ms. Coss? - Mm-hm? [speaking Spanish] Chicago is a beautiful city. Yes. I'm from Chicago. Did I tell you that? It is. It's very beautiful. Um, it's cold in the wintertime. Very, very cold. And in the summer, it's hot. Almost unbearably hot. [speaking Japanese] No, don't... don't translate that, because he doesn't... He doesn't need to know that I'm an idiot. It's OK. Is that me? [laughs] It is? - Si. - Oh-oh. I see. CARMEN: [speaking Spanish] [guitar music playing] [door shuts] [speaking Spanish] Carmen. [angelic voices singing] [knock at door] [knocking] [speaking Spanish] Oh, it's good timing. Is it? Yeah, I have some questions about Anton Chekhov. Chekhov? No, I love Tolstoy more than Chekhov, but we can talk about Chekhov. - Oh. - Are you OK? You look unwell. Are you OK? No, I'm sure I'll be fine. You know, if... perhaps they will let you go if you are ill. Oh, no, no, no. Yes. I have no intention of leaving. I'm not leaving. Oh, look. The bathroom is empty now. Look, don't worry, Gen. I can keep a secret. [speaking Spanish] [chatter] [siren whoops] What's that for? [speaking Spanish] MAN: (WHISPERING) Listen, just relax. Is it true that the government is considering shooting us all? Why would they do that? So as to pin it on the rebels. It doesn't seem to make sense. If the rebels panic, they could kill all of us in a moment of desperation. [horns honking outside] You'll give this to the government, please. We should talk about this. This cannot go on any longer. Shh. Please, they are playing. Come on. Sit down. So now this is a chess academy? You were a teacher before all this, weren't you? Your wife is in prison, your children are living in Sweden, in Stockholm with relatives, rig ht? Is this a threat? No. Not a threat. If they were to offer the release of your wife as well as a handful of other prisoners who have committed no violence, would you consider releasing the hostages? Handful of prisoners? 10 or so. And this is not an official offer. I would have to convince the other side. And safe passage to Venezuela for all of you. From Venezuela, flights to Stockholm. Where I could see my children again. Where you could see your children again. I'm sure they're missing you. I'm sure they're afraid for you. Won't you do this for them? All? We must release all political prisoners. Please consider it. Do it quickly. I have considered. Wait. Let me walk you out. What were you talking about? I tried to make him an offer. And? Well, just let's wait and see. Well, are they going to continue to negotiate? I don't know. They don't tell me anything. Please. I don't believe you. You have to know something. I'm afraid this won't go on. [speaking Spanish] [sighs] [sighs] [speaking Spanish] Voila. We start with the chicken soup a la Roxanne. God. [inaudible] [chatter] Bon appetit. [speaking Spanish] [chatter] Carrot. Carrota. No... no si como se dice. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Japanese] [chuckles] Gen? Excuse me. Um, I wanted to ask you for a favor. Um, you know Carmen? Yes. Sometimes she sleeps outside my room at night. Would you find her and... and ask her not to sleep there tonight? And then there's this other thing thatl want, but, um, I don't know. Maybe it's too much to ask.

[speaking Spanish] She says "I can ask." [speaking Japanese] [speaking Spanish] [sighs] [speaking Spanish] We are going outside. [speaking Spanish] This is it. They are going to finish us. That's my last cigarette. I told you. Stop it. [inaudible] It's great. Great. [opera singing] [speaking Spanish] Ah-ah-ah! [laughs] - Yah! - [laughs] [speaking Spanish] [laughter] [applause] [speaking Spanish] [laughter] [laughs] Tell him that he sings well. GEN: [speaking Spanish] He wants to know if you think he's a fool. No, he's not»- he's not a fool for singing. You're an idiot for going up in that tree. Tell him that a lot of the best singers in the world are from Latin America. Come on, come on. Come on down. [speaking Spanish] Ooh. Be careful. Oh, my god! I didn't mean for him to throw himself out of - the tree. Are you OK? - Are you OK? [speaking Spanish] [breathing heavily] You will teach him? Well, does he want to learn? Is he willing to work very, very hard to see if he has a voice? S. [laughs] [groans] [speaking Spanish] [chuckles] [speaking Spanish] [chuckles] Ay. Ishmael? [speaking Spanish] [siren] [speaking Spanish] [gate opens] [speaking Spanish] [patting down] [chatter in spanish] MAN: Got it! [laughter] [speaking german] [speaking Spanish] Cesar: [singing scales] [piano playing] I want to tell you that soon they will not let me come here anymore. [laughs] You are losing your job. The government feels they've put enough effort into negotiations. I have seen no effort at all. They have made us no reasonable offers. Please, give it up. Do it today. Walk outside where everyone can see you and surrender. What about our demands? Have you spoken with them in a similar way? Would they surrender? They will give up nothing. There's no chance no matter how long you wait. Then we will kill the hostages. No, you won't, because you are not murderers. You must release these people. Now. Why is it our responsibility to make every concession? Are we expected to give up because we have such a long history of giving things up? 500 fucking years. You don't think I miss my wife? My children? You think we have forgotten? You think this dream, this horrible dream, makes me forget? I don't forget anything. [speaking Spanish] If they keep us here forever, we... we will manage. Keep us here forever? Are you insane? You were the brightest one here once. Now you're as crazy as the rest of them. [chatter] How did your negotiations go today? They went. They went well. Please give it a little more time. We cannot afford to lose any innocent lives. Of course. The general would like to talk to you. He's not at his usual location.
