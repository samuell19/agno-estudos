RADIO: I have just finished reading a book called "Born Again", written by Charles Colson. I wept many times in the reading. It's the story of what really happened at Watergate and what happens when one commits his life to Jesus Christ. It's a book that will will revolutionize the life of any who read it. "Born Again" by Charles Colson. I hope you'll get a copy. HANK: Shit... HANK: Hey, Walt. JOE'S GIRL: Joe? Hurry up! You're gonna be late! JACK: How ya doin', Hank? HANK: Okay. What d'ya got?
