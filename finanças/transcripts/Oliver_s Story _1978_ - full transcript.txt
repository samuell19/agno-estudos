Sprinkle me, O Lord, with hyssop, and I shall be purified. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. O God, most kind, father of mercies, the God of all consolation, it is your will that no one who believes and hopes in you should perish. In your boundless mercy, look with kindness on your servant, Jennifer, and true faith and Christian hope commend her to you. Come to her in your saving power and because of your compassion and the death of your only son, be pleased to grant her remission and pardon all her sins that she has committed. O God, most kind, the father of mercies and the God of all consolation, it is your will that no one who believes and hopes in you should perish. In your boundless mercy, look with kindness on your servant, Jennifer, for true faith and Christian hope commend her to you. We commend our sister, Jennifer Barrett, to you, Lord. Now that she has passed from this life, may she live on in your presence and mercy and love. Lord Jesus, you alone are holy and compassionate, and cleansed from every stain by the blood of your son, may enter into life everlasting through Christ, our Lord. Lord, give her life, joy and peace in heaven, where you live forever and ever, amen. Thank you, Father. Oliver. It might be good for you to come home for a few days. Take off from work. Your room is always ready. I have to be at the office tomorrow, Mother. Go back to the car. Go sit in the car and rest. Well, please call if you need anything. I will, thank you. For coming, thank you both. Goodbye. She's not in there, Oliver. She's somewhere else. I wish I could believe that. Don't they lower a casket anymore at a funeral? I don't know. I guess they wait until everybody leaves. Well, I'm gonna stay. Come on, Oliver, it may be hours before they get around to that. It's freezing out here! I want to see it. I'll stay with you. No, Phil. This is my time with her. Please. Attention, please, the next bus to Kennedy Airport will be leaving from gate number seven. Phil! I'm sorry I'm late. Hey, kiddo, it's our night on the town. Why the books? I'm working on a new case. I've been at the law library all afternoon. I'll drop these off and you can see my new apartment, then we'll go have something to eat. As long as you've got a little milk and crackers. My ulcer needs feeding. Eh! That's it. It's about a 20-minute walk to the office. It's the only exercise I've been getting lately. Well, anything that gets you from here to there. This is how successful young lawyers live? Well, my needs are simple. Yeah, they must be. What happened here? Oh, one of my projects I never completed. I was going to knock this wall down when I first moved in. What the hell are all these books around everywhere? Phil, I'm a lawyer. I gotta read. You've also gotta live, kiddo. Well, tell me, uh... What do you do for kicks? Well, I was working on a case today I thought was pretty exciting, one of those landlords trying to pull the rug out from under his tenants. I'm glad you're savin' the world, Oliver. What about yourself? It's been two years. I'm telling you, it's time to get out and meet people. Eighteen months. What? It's been 18 months, not two years. Well, yeah. Well, I... I meant approximately. I tell you this, if we don't get to a restaurant in ten minutes, there'll be no more dates with me. I don't see anything! I'll prove to you that I am the greatest... She doesn't believe I'm an expert at making cookies. Oh, yes, this is the mad baker from Cranston, Rhode Island. Hey, that's really neat! What else are you into? Sweet rolls, cupcakes, hot cross buns. With all this bakery stuff, are you rich? Well, let's say I'm a man of means. Now I'm not as cultured as my son-in-law here. You're his father-in-law? Hey, wow... I mean, I think that's kinda neat, you two goin' out on the town together. I mean, that's really something! But, uh, tell me something. Where did you stash your wives tonight? Okay, okay, it's my mistake. I won't try this again. No more singles' bars, no more double dates with your father-in-law. I just want you to know that you don't have to feel bad about it, you know? Don't worry about Jenny or me or anybody else. You gotta plug into life again! This kind of life? Let me tell you somethin' straight, Oliver, even if it hurts. If it had been you instead of Jenny, well, she wasn't the kind to go off to a nunnery, you know. Take a guy off the ice rink, put him in a sauna, what happens to him? He's in a fog. He doesn't remember his old roommate. How you been, Barrett? Simpson, how are you? I'm fine, thank you, except about 20 pounds I don't know what to do with. Ah, married life. To Gwen, remember? You know, I have so much on my mind these days. I got six cases coming to a head at once. You're a regular workaholic, huh? Well, I like my work. Is that what you mean? No, I mean that you're a saint and a martyr and should be canonized by the Supreme Court. How about lunch? I wish I could, but I've got somethin' at the office. Steve, it's a very busy time for me right now. The old peanut butter kid rides again. Look, uh, I'm glad I ran into you, because Gwen and I have been meaning to ask you to dinner. Why? Because you're so much fun, Oliver. Now come on, 8:00 Friday, all right? I'm sorry, I'm busy. Friday, 8:00. No more excuses. Phone and address is in the book. Steve, I... I can't! Oliver, you look great! Have you lost weight? I wish Steve could! Maybe a couple of pounds. My cooking leaves a lot to be desired. Just take it easy on the appetizers, Barrett. Gwen has prepared a feast! That must be the rest of our party. You didn't tell me this was gonna be a big group thing. No, no, no. No group. It's just a single guest. You mean a guest who is single, right? Actually, she is, but... But you didn't want to scare me off. I'm sorry I'm so late! Oliver, she's very nice. Ah, Gwen, I know you both mean well. And she fixed, uh, some scones. Yeah. Um... Hi. This is Joanna Stone. This is my ex-roommate, Oliver Barrett. How do you do? How do you do? Joanna designs furniture. She does incredible things with almost nothing. Have they asked you to become a partner already? I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Have they asked him to become a partner? If he wins any more cases, they're gonna ask him to run the joint! Will you stop it? I'm sure of it! He's gonna be the president of the whole darn thing! I'll tell you something about him. We were talkin' about when we went to school. I was thinkin' about this the other day, when... This man, not in the top 10% of his class, right? Not the top 5%. Gwen. The top 1% of his class at Harvard. Right sitting across the table. First in what, 25 years, to get those... Hockey, let me tell you 'bout this! I was playing hockey. We went out there. Fantastic! Nobody could beat him! One time, we were playing against Dartmouth, right? A guy that looks like him could take on the entire Dartmouth hockey team! Here's little Joanna standing there. Everybody's quiet, right? She looks up at the guy, and she says... Everybody, dig in. "I'm proud of my work. How 'bout you?" She's incredible. She is fantastic. You wouldn't know to look at this little pretty face. She works a drill, a handsaw, right? An electric saw, a handsaw? Gwen. Anyway... She went to school with honors. She knows all about architecture. Fantastic, I mean, the shapes. You know, I think she has a whole concept. Now correct me if I'm wrong. I'll tell you something right now. If... Joanna creates space. She does not make furniture. Totally. - We go for spaces. - Right. See, Joanna designs spaces out of materials that you would never expect, right, Joanna? Yeah, tape, cord, wood. Wood, okay, wood and... Environment. It's spaces. I'm sure this is very boring for you. I'm so sorry! Why? Well, I had no idea they didn't warn you. I was given such a briefing that all I could think about was what not to say. I guess everyone you know must be trying to fix you up. No, it's not that bad. Oh, come on. A bachelor in New York who isn't a creep? Oh, I can be quite a creep when I want to be. Oh! Are you okay? Yeah. I think I just had too many refills of the wine. Yeah, I had too much, too. Well, he didn't let us get a word in edgewise. What else was there to do but drink? Um, well, thank you for seeing me home. Would like a cup of coffee before you start across town again? Oh, that's all right. I'm fine. It would be very nice to see you again, and... Do you have any decaffeinated? You mean, everything in this apartment is of your own design? Almost. Except for the old stove, of course, and one or two odds and ends. It must be great living in an environment that you've created entirely by yourself. Oh, well, there's more to environment than just furniture. And is...is this where it all begins? No, it usually begins in the bath, or when I'm buying groceries. I have to rush back here and get it all down on paper. I had a year of mechanical drawing in high school, but I always had trouble keeping a T square square. Ah. Yeah, I had to learn. I used to all my drawings on the backs of envelopes, and... But no one would take it seriously until it looked like a professional drawing. And you really make these things yourself? Oh, yes, that's the best part! I love the actual work! Um, this is my latest, over here. I called it an air chair. May I try it? Yeah, please do. Ah. Very nice. Very comfortable. My idea was to put all that inside something that had a bit more natural texture, so I used the canvas. What is that? Oh, that's very simple. Most of the stuff is made for people that travel a lot. You know, they don't want the hassle of heavy furniture when they move. It's exactly what I need for my overflow of books. Are any...could I buy this anywhere? Yes, yes, that's one of the few designs I've had accepted commercially. Can I send you a brochure? You have some lovely things here. I hope you don't think I asked you up here just to sell you things. Oh, no. So that's, uh... That's... What was it, Jamaican? No, it's half-mocha, half-Colombian, but it is decaffeinated. I mean, you won't be up all night. Oh, that's good. I need some sleep. Yes, yes, so do I. Work. Well, I'd better let you get your rest. It was, uh, the coffee, everything was very nice. Um, thank you for the evening. Thank you. Oh, it would be nice to see you again, you know, when we have more time and we're relaxed. Yes. I'll call you. Thank you, Joanna. Goodnight. Goodnight. I don't know. I'm really not sure why I'm here. In these situations, part of me says, "Go on, there she is. "She seems to like you. You like her. Take a chance." Then another part says, "Don't rock the boat. "Don't make waves. Don't... "Play it safe. "Go back to work. Don't complicate your life." Is that how you see such relationships, as complications? Sure. I mean, all relationships are complicated in one way or another. It's never easy. People seem to think I'm some kind of a freak because I don't want to go out and get laid three times a week. I just don't feel it. What do you feel? I don't know. Sometimes... I feel lonely. And I miss her... Jenny. I do. Well, I can certainly understand that. You're feeling loneliness. What do you do with these feelings? How do you express them? How do you deal with them? Well, if I'm in my apartment, I just lie down and hope they'll go away. Sometimes I'll come straight home from work. I won't even eat anything. I'll go right to bed. Now I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm famished. And I can't go back to sleep. The next morning, I wake up. I'm exhausted. It starts all over again. There's several areas here that we could work on. But a good place to start is feeling good physically. Do you do any exercise? I used to run a lot, play hockey. I love sports. I don't know. I've just drifted away from them lately. What's so funny? You and your ice skates. Well, why do they drain the rink so early? I think it's to keep people from drowning with their skates on. Well, do we have to run while we talk? Do we have to talk while we run? No, I guess not. Well, if you'd like to run alone, just say so. I will. Good. Do you run to meditate or something? You mean astral aerobics? No, I'm not much of a mystic, you know. I just do this for my tennis. Good, because I've been looking for an opponent. Someone who would play very well, then fall apart in the third set. Yeah, well you wouldn't want to play me. I've got incredible endurance. Prove it. When? Well, tomorrow, if I can catch my breath by then. Okay. Yeah? How about the Midtown Tennis Club, 27th and 8th, 6:00? Well, make it 7:00. I work till 6:00. No, it's okay. I meant 6:00 in the morning. Who plays tennis at 6:00 in the morning? We do, unless you chicken out by then. Okay, I'll try anything once. I'll reserve a court. Ask for Marcie Nash. All right, I will. Could I know the name of my victim? Gonzales. You may call me Pancho. Hey, okay, Pancho. Hey, don't forget to bring your ass, huh? What for? So I can whip it! I guess I can count on you to bring the balls! Boy, aren't we perky this morning? Do you know it's still dark outside? Well, that's why we're playing inside, Sancho. Pancho. What are we playing for? I beg your pardon? The stakes. What are we playing for? Oh, fun. I need a more tangible incentive. Okay, um, are you rich? How is that relevant? I just wanted to know how much you could afford to lose. How about dinner? Winner picks the restaurant? Oh, goody. I know just the place. Don't be premature, Miss Nash. You haven't won yet, and I warn you. I eat like an elephant. Well, that's logical. You run like one. Okay. It's your serve, Pancho. Uh, you're on the wrong side. Oh. Ooh, it's in. Oh! Oh! Listen, I have to be at work by 8:30, so let's just knock it off, okay? Well, I was just getting warmed up. Play me one more game, will ya? Double or nothin', sudden death, winner take all. Okay, fine. Thank you. Shit. So what do you do besides jog and play tennis? I work at Bonwit's. Well, that's a great-looking store. Yeah, it is. It's a swell place to shop, but you wouldn't want to work there. Why not? Because behind all of those elegant displays, it's somewhat of a mess. Really? Uh, listen, you'll be so sorry you ever asked me once I start talking about this. If we're gonna talk about work, let's talk about yours. Oh, don't be so sure. I'm a lawyer. Well, lawyers don't scare me. Are you a specialist or more like a GP? Well, I do a little bit of everything, but right now, my main interests are liberties. Giving them or taking them? These guys let the taxes on their most run-down buildings accumulate as long as they legally can, use up all their extensions, and then they turn it over to the city without paying a penny. Now the city is stuck with a lot of run-down real estate that they do not know what to do with, so they put it up for public auction. Now the absentee landlords, under a new corporate name, come back and buy it. And it all starts all over again. Does this stuff bore you? No, no, I would tell you if it did. I think you would. So what about the rest of your life? Well, there's not much to tell. Are you married? No, why do you ask that? I don't know. Something about you. Were you married? For a couple of years. That's it. Listen, I don't mean to pry. I happen to be divorced, and, you know, it's hardly a hot topic for first dates. No, it's not. Listen, I have to make a plane at 6:00 in the morning. I have to be at the airport at 6:00 in the morning, so do you mind? I have a lot of work to do myself. Waiter? Oh, listen, it's all taken care of. I mean, a deal's a deal. I don't know. I wanted to tell her the truth, but it just didn't seem right, didn't seem like the moment for it. Do you find it difficult to talk about Jenny? Yes, I do, especially to women. Doesn't seem right. Doesn't seem fair to them or to her. How do you mean not fair to her? Well... Do you believe that Jenny is dead? I saw them lower the casket into the ground. I stayed after the funeral to see that. Why did you do that? Because I felt I owed it to her. Because I wanted... I wanted it to be final. Do you sometimes feel that Jenny is reacting to what you do or say? She was the other half of me. And now that half is not there anymore. It's missing. You feel incomplete. Do you see any way that you could feel whole again? Well, people keep telling me that it's easy, you included! Just... One dies and you find another girl and you pick up right where you left off. You know my man, Orville, right? And this is Dora Corbiasco. Hello, Dora. Did you get all the names on your list? I just finished them this morning. Good. How about yours? Been to the mountaintop and back, but we did it. They can't turn us down now! We need all the ammunition we can get! Yeah, there's no good reason in the code for it. I checked the code thoroughly. Well, I would talk to Bill about it. Okay, you get back to me. All right. Good morning, Mr. Gentilano. Fifteen minutes late for an appointment. Is that how this group is gonna handle all the requirements? I'm sorry we're late. We had a lot of signatures to collect. Well, if a group can't make a deadline, they can always apply for an extension. You know about the rules, don't you, Mr. Barrett? We don't want an extension. We wanna get this show on the road! A lot of people are ready to go to work on that building, Mr. Gentilano. We don't want their enthusiasm lost in any more delays. But I don't want this program hurt by any group rushing into this kind of responsibility half-cocked. Believe it or not, there is a reason for each of these approvals. There better be. I signed each one of these questions three times. And I told the truth each time. Yeah, well, I'll get to it as soon as I can. Obviously, nothing's gonna happen overnight. Mr. Gentilano, I know the usual waiting time, but if you could see what these people have been able to do on their own, I think you'd realize they deserve a quicker answer. You should come down and visit us sometime. I should visit a lot of projects. Brooklyn, Staten Island, East Side, West Side. Uh, well, uh, let's see what I can do. Well, you sure didn't humor me today! I had a week to lose my sense of humor. Well, I don't know what you're so pissed off about. You won another dinner. Oh? There was a dinner? Well, isn't that what we play for? Tangible incentives? Yeah. I just didn't know it was a standing bet. Only if I get to pick the restaurant. All right. I used up my list on the first try. Where would you like to go? Do you know La Cremaillere? It's a country French restaurant north of the city. Sounds interesting. I have to be at our store in Scarsdale next Friday. Maybe, if it's convenient for you, you could pick me up there. Excuse me, lady. Is this Macy's or Gimbels? Twelve minutes late, Oliver. Oh, I just drove through the most incredible rush-hour traffic! It was a horrible ordeal. Well, it must have been horrible. It looks like your car aged a little bit in the process. This was a Ferrari when I started. This is very good. I have to say it again. I told you. And also very expensive. So how's the unholy mess? Huh? The store? I mean, is the one in Scarsdale doing as badly as the one in the city? Oh, no. No. As a matter of fact, the reason that I'm here is that... I'm what you could call a troubleshooter. I had some ideas for reorganizing things, so management gave me some space in the store to try my experiments. And are they working? Yeah, they are. They're working very well. Well, you don't seem very pleased about it. It's the end of one thing and the beginning of something else. I can't try things for the hell of it anymore, you know? Because they're watching me. They're keeping score now. I don't like being watched. I know what you mean. Would you like to see the dessert menu? Oh, listen, I'm just gonna have coffee, but they have serious desserts here. You ought to have one. Well, it sounds tempting. I'd better not. I'm trying to stay in shape, remember? Two coffees, please. Boy, nice willpower. What about yours? You know, I'm good tonight in front of you, then tomorrow I'll sneak off somewhere and eat ice cream and eclairs. That's the difference between us, you know? I'm self-indulgent, and you're self-sacrificing. What do you mean? I don't know. It's just an impression that I get. You believe in rightness and fairness and high-minded things. I bet you didn't even tell lies when you were a kid. Oh, yes, I did. Sometimes I still do. What do you mean? Well, it wasn't a lie, exactly, but I wasn't being completely honest with you last week. I mean, you...you, uh... you seemed to assume that I was divorced. You're separated? She's dead. I mean, how did... How old was she? She was 25. Leukemia. I'm really sorry, Oliver. I know this was not the right time to tell you, but I'm not a good liar, Marcie, and I couldn't let it go on like this. Oh, I know. It's okay. Excuse me, the clerk would like to know if you will be staying the night. The reservation says "Will confirm." And there are other requests. Yeah, I will be staying the night, thanks. You're staying here? Mmm-hmm. You know, they have the cutest rooms upstairs. Fireplaces, brass beds, very tasteful. How could you stay here if you didn't have a car? You don't have to take it that way, Oliver. It's just I don't like to feel managed, to be maneuvered into something. I have to go to Hartford tomorrow. I had someone bring my car over. Well, have a good time in Hartford. Sorry it worked out this way. Maybe we can start over again the next time. Maybe. Call me sometime? You never gave me your number, remember? Do you want it? I don't know. Well, let me know if you decide. Morning. This is it? Did you get that name I wanted you to track down? I checked with personnel at Bonwit's. Well, did you find her? There's only one employee named Nash. That's it. Get her on the phone. Uh, her name is Albert. Albert? That's the only one? Okay, Barrett! What is this 6:00 a.m. crap? I didn't get to sleep till midnight! Well, go to bed earlier tonight. You mean we gotta go through this again? I haven't even finished this match yet. Steve, there's a girl involved. Oh, yeah. Joanna? No, it isn't. Anyway, she comes here at 6:00 sometimes, and it's the only way I have of finding her. Okay, anything for the cause. Ah. Ah, what happens if she doesn't show up tomorrow? Well, we just have to keep playing till she does. Hello, doctor. And how are you today? Not so good. Any particular reason? Oh, I could name a few. You know that case that I was working on? Oh, the law, it seems so simple until you get down to specifics. Now I'm not sure that case is going to work at all. You remember that girl, Marcie, I was telling you about? Well, I had an argument with her. I walked out without finding out how to get in touch with her. I've tried to call her. There's no number. There's no address. She's not even listed. So she seems lost to you? I didn't know I could feel this miserable anymore. Do you think you could see that as some sort of progress? Is that when you know it's good for you? When it hurts? Hello? Hello, Oliver, it's me. It's Marcie. Hi, how are you? Oh, fine, you know, busy, lonely, feeling a little stupid. Do you think we could talk? We are talking. I mean off the phone. I've been on the phone all week. Where are you? I'm at the store. Maybe it's time that you saw me in my natural habitat. Which store? The main one. You know where it is, right? I just don't know how you can work there and not be on someone's employees list. Oh, you checked up on me, huh? I was trying to find you, for God's sake. Well, I can explain all this. Just ask at the elevator for the executive offices. Hello, excuse me. Did you see anybody working here today? Oh, there's nobody works on Saturdays. Her name is Marcie. Oh, Marcie! She works over there on the other side. Hi. Hi. "Marcie Bonwit?" I use my maiden name here. I can see. You don't work for Bonwit's. It works for you. Oh, come on, Oliver. It's not quite that simple. You wanna go for a drive? I admit, I'm a little paranoid. I give a lot of credit for that to my ex-husband. What was he like? He was the perfect Mr. Right. He was everybody's idea of the man I should marry, including my own. He was bright. He was charming. He was ambitious. He was really ambitious. What's he doing now? He's a wealthy divorce living in Beverly Hills, investing his money very wisely. Wow. You know, I don't mind the money. What I regret is really just handing my life over to someone. You know, really just giving it all to them, basing it all on them, and then... Then my father died. We lost control of the company, and they gave me a seat on the board as consolation. It was a hell of a year. So this is where we go when I'm buying? Listen, I love this place. We used to come here every summer after camp. We? Yeah, my parents and I. They were so concerned about me mixing with the people, they always put me in situations where the other kids were from Brooklyn or the Bronx. Hey. Give me some cookies for the kid. I was always the only rich kid. I spent my childhood pretending to be poor. Want me to make you feel better? My family is filthy rich, too. Two hot dogs, two coffees, please. The works. Oliver, why didn't you tell me that? I was afraid you'd love me only for my money. You want some mustard? It's free. Please. Thank you. Rich kid. It's nice out. Let's stay by the car. Okay. To our true identities. Whatever they may be. What are you looking at? That funny sign over there. No brass beds, probably no fireplaces. We could watch a little TV. We got room service. When will I see you again? How about five seconds? One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four, one thousand five, one thousand... Look at that sunset. How are you doing? Fine. But you feel a little guilty, right? Maybe. 'Cause you thought about Jenny? Because I didn't. Red Apple motel, our rooms are rotten to the core. Oliver, what is the Red Apple motel? I didn't know it would be you. I was expecting a call from an old college friend. Well, your mother and I were just talking about next weekend. We haven't seen you for months really. Well, I don't know if I can make it. I have an awful lot of work piled up. I know, Oliver, but your mother would be very disappointed. Well, what does she have on the agenda? Oh, nothing elaborate, but we'd just love to have a quiet weekend alone. All right, I'll come down on Saturday, but I have to be back here Sunday night. We understand, Oliver. How are you, Sean? Hello, Mother. Darling, how are you? Oh, I'm fine. How are you? Oh, I'm bearing up. Did you come alone? Yes. Where's father? Oh, he's on the phone. Darling, why don't you run up and change, then join us for a drink? All right, I'll see you in a minute. Well, I personally think it's a much better approach to saving these urban areas than the... These government projects. Now if I can only get it through the city bureaucracy, these people, whatever work they put in, whatever labor, whatever carpentry, plumbing... That becomes part of the investment towards their own building. That's what they call their "sweat equity." Couldn't they call it something else? Mom, I think that's a very good word for it. That's all these people have to invest, is their sweat, their labor. You know, not everybody was born with trust funds. That's a very interesting idea, Oliver. I'm in favor of anything that expands the tax base. Oh, there are some very sound economic arguments for this, Father. These are not charity cases. Now all my life, I was taught to believe that poor people did not know how to take care of property. Well, why should they when they don't own it? And the people that do, these absentee landlords, these no-name corporations, do you think that they give a shit? Oh, Oliver! Well, Mother, do they? They don't care about the human beings that live there. Oliver, it's admirable for you to give so much time to such a project, but keep it in perspective. I'll try, Father. Oliver, I want you to try some of these. I think you've been losing weight. I've been running. I'm getting back into shape. I'm trying to lose a few pounds. I want you to leave here well-fed and well-rested. "There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile. "He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile. "He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, "and they all lived together in a little crooked house." Next month, Oliver, I'll be 68 years old. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of retirement. I didn't know that. The only thing that bothers me is who would run things? Ward and his family own 12%. Seymour has 10%, and the rest is ours, ultimately yours. Well, Ward's a good man. I think you can trust him. He's certainly been around long enough. Oh, he'd handle the business and banking side of it, all right, but as far as the mill is concerned, he wants to sell that. He says it's a losing proposition. Oh, he'd look after his interests fine, but I don't think he'd look out for ours as well. Things wouldn't be the same. What do you mean? Oliver, this business was started by our family. It's identified with our family. And a member of our family needs to be in it, needs to be involved. Father, if you're talking about me, I have involvements of my own. But you'd have a bit of time for your own projects. But I don't want a bit of time. I need a lot of time for my work, for my life. Oliver, where's Gentilano? He got away from you already? No, I thought it would be better for Willy and Dora to show him around for a while. It's about time for our spontaneous coffee break. Has he cracked a smile yet? No smile. He looks like a sergeant inspecting the barracks. Now what are we going to, plan A or plan B? Plan A for now. Mix the plaster. I can pin a large canvas on the wall and paint to my heart's content. I see. Anybody ready for coffee? I got a pot full downstairs. Every time you have to repair the walls, you're gonna have to buy three different colors of paint. Uh, Mr. Gentilano, I'd like you to meet Carlos Cruz. You know, most people would put a sheet metal door there, an ugly one. Carlos, tell him where you got that door. I don't like desperdicios, waste, you know, so I took this door from a building, an abandoned building, a few blocks away. It was 14 blocks. Teo carried it on his back. I want to bring character to this place. I live here, and I want to... I wanna be orgulloso, proud. That's why we could do a better job of rehabilitating this place than a contractor. I wouldn't be too sure. So the real question is not what gets done on one day when you have a party, but what happens, whether or not you go back to work on Monday. You know, I've had several groups like this attempt the same thing, and they've failed. Then I go back to my office, and my department has egg on its face. Now what I'm trying to say here is that we are concerned about you, but that there are layers and layers of government over us, and that when budget time comes, they want to know what happened to their money. Now a good program, a responsible program, is good publicity. A bad program, an abandoned program... An abandoned program is bad publicity. Now if the wrong people get wind of it, then our program is destroyed, absolutely destroyed. Now, uh... What's that? Oh, that's the television crew. They've been coming down here. They're just filming the work. I hope we didn't knock your concentration. No, no, that's all right. Landlord problems are nothing new, but here in the lower East Side, or Low East Side, as sometimes it is called, there is a new approach to an old problem. Waltereen Jones and Willy Hernandez represent the tenants' committee of this building. Can you tell us exactly what's going on here today? We're settling in. This is a work party to launch the rehabilitation of this building by the tenants and the neighborhood. Is this an official project, or should I say, a spontaneous gesture? You have to ask our lawyer, Oliver Barrett, how official it is. Sir? Uh, well, we're fortunate to have Mr. Gentilano with us today. Perhaps you should... He's a city official. Ask him your question. Sir, what do you think of what you have seen here today? Albert Gentilano. I am very impressed with what is happening in this community. And we're very impressed that a city official, a civil servant like yourself, would take time out of his busy schedule to come down here. Actually, I get here as often as I can. This is where the action is. I mean, good government isn't sitting behind a desk. I'm proud of these people. I'm proud of the way they're pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. I mean, what we have here is what we call sweat equity. That's correct. Do they have your official go-ahead then? Of course, of course! How about that? There you are. Hello, Barrett residence. Who is this? This is Marcie. I'm the mad baker from Cranston. Who? I want to congratulate Oliver. It's the mad baker from Cranston? I'll get it. He says he wants to congratulate you on something. Yeah, I'm sure. Hello, Phillip! Hey, terrific, Oliver! I'm proud of you! How you been doin'? Great, great. I'm going to Miami. Well, that's great. I hope you enjoy yourself. I hope you enjoy yourself, if you know what I mean! Yes, Phil, I know what you mean. Well, good-bye! Good-bye. Who was that? It was my ex-father-in-law. Is he always like that? No, I think he just gets like that when he's around me. He's trying to rediscover his lost youth or something. Listen, he did sound kinda cute. Oh, he is very cute. If you want to catch him, he's taking that 9:00 plane to Miami. He didn't sound that cute. I'm staying put. Good. I better get your dinner before your tuna fish gets cold. What did you do, fry it? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? Take the big plate. I'll take the one with the crack in it. I notice that your silverware is pretty eclectic also. I like all this stuff! Yeah, I know. So did I. I went through the same stage myself. What stage? Oh, you know, the sort of mock poverty routine. What do you mean? I mean that finally you have to come to terms with who you are. You and I, Oliver, are upper-class wasps, and we're always going to be. I mean, our guilt about that isn't gonna change anything. These things are not important to me. I don't have to have caviar or eat off sterling silver. But you know good stuff, and you like it. I mean, I saw some of the labels in your closet. Did you come over here to argue or what? I thought we were going to have dinner. If you don't like this, I'll take you back to La Cremiere. La Cremaillere. Listen, Oliver, you don't have to make everything a class struggle. I'm in the same class. Now eat your tuna fish. Don't be defensive. Who's defensive? Hello, this is Oliver Barrett. Is she in? Just a minute, please. Is it important? She's very, very busy. Uh, would you tell her it's me on the line? It will only take a minute. All right, hold on a minute. Thank you. Hello? Hello, Marcie, how are you? Can I call you back? Of course, I... I just wanted to say that I was sorry about the other night. I think things got a little tense. I understand. I'm in a board meeting. Can we talk about it later? Sure. I get the message. Good-bye. You were like a total stranger. It was scary. I'm sorry, Oliver. It's just a policy I have to stick to. I can't take a call in the middle of one of those meetings. It makes me sound like a lovesick teenager. I just don't know how you can play roles like that, Marcie. How you can put one hat on, take one hat off so arbitrarily. Well, it's not all that difficult once you get used to it. I don't think I'd want to get used to it. No one's asking you to. What do you mean by that? I just mean that when you met me, I wasn't in the kitchen cooking casserole. I work, Oliver. I like it! I mean, this is it. Accept it. I don't try to change you. Well, what are you then, a business magnate or a woman? Well, Oliver, what are you, a man or a lawyer? What kind of question is that? I would just like to know if I am to be your boyfriend on the weekends, and then during the week, I'm just another one of those telephone calls that's put on hold. Oliver, I never put you on hold. My God, I can't believe it! Do you always exaggerate like this? What if you're in the middle of a meeting with the senior partners, and someone named, for God's sake, Marcie calls? I mean, what do you do? Well, that's easy. First I would resign, and then I would call you back from the unemployment office. I'm sorry, Oliver. It's just that I'm trying to be more than a decoration at a board meeting, and it ends up taking a lot out of me. I get really tired of doing it all alone. Well, I'm exhausted, too. This case is taking ten times more work than I expected. What a pair. Listen, I'm going to Hong Kong on Tuesday. I have to check out some factories there and handle a photo session. You wanna come with me, and we'll make a working vacation out of it? Hong Kong! Well, isn't that halfway around the world? Exactly! Welcome back. How was your trip? It was fine. This is Oliver Barrett. This is John Hsiang. He's our man in Hong Kong. Hello. Hello, John. That was quite a view you provided on our landing. Oh, we do our best. Is this your first trip to Hong Kong? John, the man has never been out of New York, you understand. Oh, how is the big apple? Anything less than the penthouse will be a comedown. All I could get was something called the Marco Polo suite John, can you get two extra models for the photo sessions tomorrow? You got it. Nice to meet you, Oliver. Oh, thank you, John. The car will be here at 10:00. Pleasant dreams. Thanks, John. Good night. Good night. I got one question. What? Do you see a bedroom tucked around here anywhere? I think I saw one just around the corner. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Oh, my God. Where'd you learn to eat with chopsticks? You noticed? I had this Chinese friend at Harvard. He promised to teach me to eat with chopsticks if I would teach him to ice-skate. If I were you, I'd ask for a refund. But you should see him skate. Do you have any film left? About half a roll. You're kidding. Most people who come here, the first day they get here, they buy three cameras and shoot 12 rolls of film. I think that's why I didn't. You should just relax and be a tourist, Oliver. It's permitted, you know. Is it a requirement? No, but, I mean, it is what a lot of these people live on. Yes, I see how they live. I know. That was hard for me, too, when I first came here. But you got over that stage. You know, Oliver, this is beginning to sound like a conversation we've already had. Yes, it is. I'm sorry. No, let's talk about it. Oh, no, let's not. I'll be over here. Okay. Hi. I'm sorry. These things always take longer than they're supposed to. It's all right. It's a lovely setting. We're in a heated debate over underarm hair. Well, you're the boss, aren't you, Marcie? Isn't it your decision? Marcie! Marcie! Time's running out. Come on. Okay, that's fine. Oliver. Oliver. Move back. Okay, ladies. And go. Good. Go. And go. Good. One more. Ready, okay. Nice. And again. I thought we settled that. I wish I'd known about it before I left New York! Well, I guess I have to. I mean, do I have a choice? Right. Okay, I'll see you. I'll see you at 10:00. Good-bye. What's wrong? Another crisis. I'm sorry. I have to meet some people. Do you mind? No, it's all right. We can sightsee later. John, maybe this is a good time to take Oliver around. I have a complete tour all planned. You know what I'd like to do? See your factory. What for? I don't know. I know everything else about your business. I'm curious. We'll have to make another tour on a nice day. That's all right. I want to see it all. This route to the factory is not the best look at Hong Kong. They're so young! Don't let the youth fool you. These are some of the best cutters in the business, and we pay them well by Hong Kong standard. Their parents may be working in another part of the factory. We also have work that the grandparents can do. On this side, each person handle one piece of a garment. On the other side, they assemble everything. I must admit, John, I had a slightly different picture in my mind. Yes, I know. In the United States, Hong Kong means sweat shops. Well, what do you think? About what? About the factory. You made such a point about wanting to see it, but you haven't mentioned it since. I was very impressed... Air-conditioned. Surprised? No, not really. I was beginning to think that you expected dirt floors and rats and 8-year-olds slaving away. Well, Marcie, you've got to admit that there is a certain image to Hong Kong labor. Yeah. So you thought I was running a sweat shop, huh? I don't know what you're doing. Well, listen, I hope you're not too disappointed. Why should I be? Because it would have made a great excuse. For what? For you to break this off and still come out looking swell. But I don't need any excuses. And besides, who's talking about breaking anything off? I guess the point is that you're not talking about anything. Period. Why do I feel that as long as I'm in the wrong tax bracket, this is never gonna work? That's not true. Of course it is. That's why you're partly obsessed with Jenny, because she was your pass to the people... Don't ever talk about her like that! Ever! You just leave her out of it, please! Keep her out of it? How can I? She's right between us! I can't even reach you, she's so much in the way! Then reach for me in another way! There is no right way with you, Oliver. You don't know what it's like to compete with a dead woman. Then stop trying! Leave her alone! Leave me alone! I don't need anybody. You're right, Oliver. Only the living need each other. Well, what am I, dead? I don't know, but something feels dead here, and you know, I'm sick of trying to bring it back to life. I'm okay. Just takes a little while to adjust, that's all. Actually, it's better this way. Why do you say that? Well, for as long as I was with Marcie, there was always this growing tension that happened between us. I mean, we had fun. It was exciting. Where do you think that came from? I know I'm not supposed to make comparisons about Jenny, but I really don't think I'll ever be able to keep from doing it. Nothing happens magically, Oliver, but just being aware of a problem is beginning to solve it. * The years are comin' on, So better face it * And the lamp is burnin' low * Oh, you can't do The things you used to do * Thirty-five years ago * Oh, no, you can't Do the things * You used to do * Thirty-five years ago * No way Okay, if there's anybody left that don't know me, my name is Jamie Francis, and I work here, huh? Now if this were an ordinary day, and I started to make a speech, the old folks would reach for a chair and light up a pipe. And the young ones would reach for their sweetheart and slip away behind the looms. But it's not an ordinary day, and well we know it. So I won't be boring you with that sort of speech. Now this shuttle is from loom number one. And on those calculators, we got the payroll department, Maria Labruzzo figured out this has made the trip back and forth between the yarns over seven million times! So we have decided to take it out of loom number one and give it a rest. Give it to someone else who deserves a rest. It's, uh... It's a homely sort of thing, but it means a lot to us, Mr. Barrett. We hope it means as much to you. Oh, yeah, I have to read the inscriptions. "To Oliver Barrett III, "who stayed when others left. "In gratitude, the men and women of Barrett Mills." Thank you. Thank you very much, indeed. I... Thank you. Mr. Barrett. Congratulations, Father. It's beautiful. Thank you, Oliver. Thank you. I'm so glad you've been here to see this. So am I. Oh, have you had anything to eat yet today? Not much. Where is the food, anyway? Well, it's over there. Go help yourself. Okay, I'll be right back. You are spending the night, aren't you? Yes, Mama. Welcome back. Hey, John. How you doing? Nice to see you. Nice seeing you, too. I don't care what you say, Jamie. It don't strike me right for the union and the members to be knockin' themselves out to throw the boss a party. True we're on opposite sides of the bargaining table, but this goes beyond that, Arlie! My old man would turn over in his grave. Remember, he led the strike against Barrett's father. Got his head broke for it, too. Ah, those were bitter days. Barrett's old man is not the same as Barrett. This man, you can deal with. Remember, just as easy as that, he could close down this whole place. Years ago, when the others were goin' to Carolina and to Puerto Rico for cheap labor, he took a half-million dollars from his banking company and sunk it into this place to keep it going... Oh, there you are, Oliver. Good morning, Father. Good morning. Did you sleep well? I'm usually awake at 6:00. Your mother's still asleep, though. I just discovered some homemade donuts. Would you like one? Oh, no, no, let's call Stewart. He usually doesn't start until 8:00 on Sunday morning, but he can fix breakfast today and put it in the study or the dining room, wherever you'd like to eat. Where I would like to eat is right here. This is my favorite room in the house. Besides, I've made some coffee. I used to love this room when I was a kid. I liked the way it smelled. Yeah. Yeah, I remember we had a wonderful cook when I was a child. I remember climbing the trees to get apples for her to make her own cider. Her name was Clara. She was Dutch. Died before you were born. Would you like cream and sugar? No, no, just black. Now I think we should take a drive in the country this afternoon. Lovely this time of the year. And I promise not to talk business. Oh, you can talk all the business that you want to. I just want you to know that I enjoyed yesterday very much. I've never seen the mill quite like that. I never had the feeling you were interested in the mill, Oliver. I used to hate it. I was thinking about that yesterday. Why? But I realized, it... It was because the mill took you away from us so much. I never realized. I just want you to know that, uh... That I'm proud of what you've been able to preserve here. Father, I'd like to help in any way I can. Only the living need each other. Only the living can carry life on. Part of me was trying to die because I thought I owed that to Jenny. I owe her something else. Something much harder to give. A new life, another try, a setting free.
