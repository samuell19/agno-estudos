Looks like Laura's shop is really comin' along. This damn town's becomin' a tourist trap. Somebody put a bug up your ass Carl? Son, I got a pension that's way overdue. A boat and some land down in baha, and while you're here givin' traffic tickets, I'ma be drownin' in cold margaritas and hot senoritas. Send me a postcard first. You're not gonna desert us before your party are ya? Nah, I'll stick around and help you break in the new deputy. You mean scare the shit out of him. Bullseye. Talk about bein' in the rough.

Come on, up. Come on, get up. There you go. Why don't you guys give me a break? I gotta make the payments on my truck. Well that ain't hardly our problem though is it Sam? Well, it is his birthday. Ah. You mean you ain't gonna cut 'em down? Nah. You are. Hey, you see any marijuana around here, Sam? Can't say that I do. Well, I think I ought to head on back to the station then. See ya St... Next year try grapes. Right. Santa alba must be a big change from San Francisco Jay. That's for sure. Santa alba shores. What a bunch of bullshit. Hey. What do you think? You're beautiful. Well, thank you. Can I borrow you for a second? Sure. Annie wants to say goodnight. She refuses to go to sleep until you say goodnight to her. To the rescue. Jerry, over here. Jay, what's the architect's name? J do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do I hi Sam. Where's your uniform? I put my party clothes on to come see you. You look handsome. Jimmy? Yeah? Your mother tells me it's past your bedtime. Oh, can't we do a little longer? No, no, the sandman's comin'. Goodnight Sam. Yeah, sleep tight sweetie. I bet you anything she's got her light on right now. She's probably up there startin' on a fort. She probably is awake. Ah, Sam. Is my Laura takin' good care of you? Yeah, we were just uh, discussing your development for Santa alba. Yeah, this uh, sleepy little Hamlet of yours is about to undergo quite a change. I guess so. Laura, why don't you fix Sam a drink. Uh, Sam excuse me, can I talk to you a moment? Yeah. - Excuse us. Uh, listen, let's face it. I mean, you're a handsome guy, you're a bright guy, but you're stuck in a dead end job. No, it's not so bad. Oh, what do you do? Ticket a few tourists, you bust the town drunk. You get a little pocket money from the growers. I don't find that very funny. Hey, Sam listen, I'm gonna fix it so this community doesn't have to depend on the dopers and the tourists and I want you to help me. Hm. What'd you have in mind? Well, our little community is gonna need a lot of security. We're lookin' to attract people of substance. People with a lotta money. You could run the whole show. Thanks. I like what I'm doin' now. Well, if you don't mind my askin', how much are you makin' now? I don't think this is the time or place. Sweetheart, please. Let Sam answer, huh? 15, 20,000. Well, which is it? 15 or 207? Uh, I'll be makin' 20 when I take over for Carl. How would you like to make five times that amount as my head of security? There's only one problem with that. I'd uh, I'd have to answer to you. No, I'm just messin' with ya. You know [, I uh, well I heard something the other day. Something that Laura never told me before. What's that? I heard that uh, the two of you used to be the hottest item in Santa alba. That was a long time ago. Well, let's keep it that way, okay? Thanks for your hospitality. You're a real bastard you know that? Damn Sam, what the hell's this? Goin' away gift. Go ahead, open it up. Santa alba sheriff's station, deputy wayburn speakin'. Hi Sam, it's me. Hi. I wanted to apologize for last night. I'm the one who should apologize. I wasn't thinkin'. I need to see you. Are you all right? Yeah. How 'bout uh, point cobrea road. Right, I'll meet you there. Goodbye. Bye. 1 uh, I gotta go. You're never gonna take my advice are you? I got this far without it. Why should I start now? Yeah. Hey, you like that present? Yeah, I like it god damn it. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. You take care. Damn. Come on, come on. Laura? Laura? Laura! Laura, go to the right! - Sam! Laura! Laura! Laura! Are you okay? No brakes. Shh, shh. Take it easy, come on. Just breathe. Breathe. You're gonna be all right, Laura. You're just a little scared that's all. I don't blame you. I'm goin' over to dick's garage. Make sure he checks that car over right. Okay? I appreciate that. Sure. There you go. Feelin' better? He was trying to kill me and make it look like an accident. What are you talkin' about? It was Jake. That's a pretty serious accusation. You don't know him Sam, not like I do. Annie could have been in there. Sam, you've got to help me. Okay. I'll investigate it. Great. Maybe I'll have to take care of things myself. What do you mean? I have to get him before he gets me. I'm gonna be the chief of police and you're tellin' me this? Yeah, maybe I am. Oh, maybe you're not. This conversation is over. You understand? Sure. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm lookin' for Sam wayburn. What can I do for ya? My name is Brian Mars. Who? Brian Mars. Your new deputy. Hi. Wow. This is pretty nice. My name is Brian Mars. Hi, I'm Laura winslow. Huh. Nice to meet ya. I'm not late or anything am 1? I had a little car trouble outside of Fresno. No, you're on time. Good 'cause I busted my ass gettin' here. You guys are really up to date, huh? That's a gun cabinet, huh? Yeah. We don't have much call to use it though. It's really nice. Who's the fisherman? Sheriff Cunningham. Huh. This him here? Yeah. Ah. He retired yet? No. Oh. Well I can't tell ya how glad I am to have this job. Very nice here. Well, here we are. It's not the ritz but uh, the rent's free, and you don't have a whole lotta neighbors. That's all right. People basically suck if you know what I mean. The water and electricity should be workin'. Yep. Great. Oh yeah. This is better than a lot of places I've been in. So, come by the station tomorrow and I'll fix you up with some uniforms. Okay. And uh, me and Carl, that's uh, sheriff Cunningham will show you around. Great. You carry a gun? No. Okay. That's uh, that's about it. Santa alba's a pretty quiet place, but uh, well, I think you'll like it here. Hey, I got a bottle of whisky in the back of my car. Wanna have a couple shots, shoot the shit, you know? Some other time. Thanks. See ya tomorrow. Fuck you too. You're not leavin' again are ya? I mean, do we have to go through this every six months? Where you off to this time? Bed and breakfast? Holiday inn? Or maybe for a little romp in the back of Sam's patrol car? Recreate the good old days. This has nothing to do with him. It's you Jake. I'm sick of youl I'm sick of us! You're sick of me, huh? But you're sick of the things that I buy for you. You're not sick of the jewelry or the clothes. You're not sick of the house that I gave you, that I worked for, that I paid for. I gave you everything. Nobody ever gave me anything. That doesn't mean anything to me. No. All that you care about is this. Things, things, things. You just take, take, take. You never give. Well let me tell you something. I'm gonna cut you off completely. I'm taking something. I'm gonna take Annie. You'll be lucky if you see her once in a month. Fuck youl! On! Come here. Let me go! You don't owe me! I'll do whatever I want! You're gonna do what you want, huh? Huh? You wanna do whatever you want? Yeah. You little whore. Local girl makes good. The front discs had very little hydraulic fluid left and the drums in the back are worn to shit. Now that probably happened when she was rollin' down hill. You see any signs of tampering? Well, fluid come out of a tiny hole there in the hose, but to hell, anything coulda caused that. You wouldn't wanna venture a guess? Just uh, between us? Anything coulda caused it. Faulty hose. I once had a mouse crawled in and nawed down an electrical cable. A mouse? Yeah. Strange things happen. You can't tell. See the skid starts here and uh, this is where she just about went off the cliff. Car ended up clear around the corner. She almost bought the farm didn't she? That's right. What did dick say? He didn't know what happened. That figures. How many miles on the car? 12,000. Normal driving. Stu, you know about cars. What do you think? It's kinda weird Sam. Brakes go out on a couple of cars, they can forget the whole product line. They usually check 'em out pretty carefully. Which means? Which means uh, I don't think they went out without some help. But you can't prove nothin'. I'll tell ya one thing. You ain't gettin' me to testify in court. So, what do ya think? How do I look? Oh, ready to bust a jaywalker. Scare the hell out of some uppity seagull. Yeah. Keep your pistol in the gun cabinet. We only pull 'em out when there's a problem. Are you serious? Yeah. Seems a shame to have this kind of a weapon and not be able to carry it around. Ah shit boy, you stand a better chance of shootin' yourself in the foot than ever need a weapon around here. You got all your keys now Brian? Uh, yep. Well, I guess it's time I go check on the town, huh? Yeah, I'll go with ya. Okay. Take it easy Sam. Thank you Sam. I hear ya like to fish. Who told ya that? Sam. Yeah. I got you these. Oh not you too huh? Yeah. Oh damn, these are beautiful. It's about the best present I've gotten. Did you make these yourself? Yeah. My old man taught me how. Yeah? Tell ya, before I leave town, I'ma show you some of my favorite fishin' spots. Might as well show 'em to somebody who will appreciate 'em. Yeah, Sam goes fishin' with me but he's not really a fisherman. He just likes to keep me company. Good boy. You'll be all right around here. That's beautiful, look at that. It's not unusual for a husband to have a life insurance policy on his wife. For three million dollars? Did Jake tell you about this? No. Sam, what am I gonna do? Bring Annie and stay with me. Oh! And one day we'll come home and some guys will throw acid in our faces. That's the kinda guy he is. He'd do that. With the lawyers he can buy I'd lose Annie. I'd never see her again. We'll figure somethin' out. Oh Jesus. Oh my god. Feels like the currents are startin' to shift. Yeah, these currents are gonna carry me down to old Mexico. You have everything all taken care of? Yeah. You sure you wanna go? I guess. Not gonna be the same without ya. Well, the kid'll work out. Just a little green's all. Yeah, I suppose. Just not gonna be the same. Yeah. Yeah. Brian! Whoa! Jesus Christ, Carl. My god, that's not funny. Got a job for ya sleepin' beauty if you think you can spare the time. I think I can handle it. Wrap these up and put 'em in the freezer in the back. You can take a couple home with ya if you want. You got it. Thank you. See the game last night? No, I don't have a TV. Oh. The damn giants were four runs behind when I turned it off. What a bunch of losers. Every year it's the same. My money's gonna be on the mets. Jesus Christ. One thing's for sure, the world series is gonna be great. Anything there for me? No. Good afternoon gentlemen. Hi. Hi Carl, I hope I'm not disturbing you. Oh no, not at all. We just stopped by to let you know that the American legion is gonna let us use the hall for your party. Oh shucks man. You didn't have to go to all that trouble for an old flat foot like me. Cut it out. It's our pleasure. I mean, what is - yeah. The women's auxiliary for? It's gonna be a great party. Okay. Fine. Uh, would any of you ladies like some fresh trout? Sam and I caught some just this morning. Sure. Okay. Carl? Yeah? Why don't you let me cook this up for you for dinner one night before you go? That'd be great. I'll talk to ya later. See ya Brian. Yeah. Bye Brian. Bye. Nice to meet ya. Women, huh? Hey Brian, you all right? You look green around the gills. No, fine. Well, you better wrap them fish up before they start smellin'. They already do. Back it up. Keep comin'. Look out Sam! Bonsai! Stay outta trouble. Hey Nell. Hi Sam. Hey Annie. How you doin' Princess? Fine. Annie's staying over at my place tonight aren't you Annie? That's right, so mom and dad can have quality time. A little romance is good for a marriage. Hm. Bye Sam. Damn! Come on! Sam! Is he dead? Is he dead? On! Okay. What did you give him? Sam! What, what? I put some valium in his whisky. You're out of your mind. Completely gone. You can't do this! This is murder, first degree murder! Then arrest me. Let's get him back in the house. Rise and shine. My head feels like I got hit by a mack truck last night. Hm. Can't imagine why. Must've had too much to drink. You were very athletic last night. Don't you remember? You're so beautiful. I love you. Love you. Remember the first time we made love? Was that at my brother's place? You don't remember? I do. I just want you to tell me about it. It was in your brother's bedroom. Somebody was playing steely Dan downstairs. Hm. You were a young man then. Hey? You better leave. I know. Laura? Is something wrong with the food Sam? No, I'm just not hungry. You can take it away. So, when are you gonna call me? I've been busy. I'll just bet you have. How's it goin' Carl? Morning sweetie. Just a cup of coffee please. - Okay. Damn arthritis is killin' me. You wanna talk about it? What's that? You got that pussy look on your face. Kinda look a man gets when he's thinkin' with his dick. I don't know what you're talkin' about. The hell you don't. Oh, thank you honey. I know I'm never gonna be able to get through that thick skull of yours. It's none of your business. Look son, you're about to become sheriff. Now you better get your head screwed on straight. Hey, if I need your fuckin' advice I'll ask for it. Must be his time of the month. Yeah. I wish he'd just disappear. I'm sure there's all kinds of ways he could disappear. Just yesterday, Carl, Brian and I were talkin' about goin' huntin'. We invite Jake along. He gets between me and a deer, the gun goes off, wham! He's gone. An accident. Yeah. Or I could take him fishing and push him off the boat into the water. You're worse than I am. He'd wash up on the beach like a piece of drift wood. Hey. Now you've gotta promise me that you won't try that again. Try what? Try to kill Jake. I'm sorry but I can't promise that. I love you so much. Okay. Now, say, say I was gonna help you. Yeah? Would you do what I say? I think so. I'm not gonna lose you. Everything's gonna be okay. Brian, hold your fire! What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Put your gun down. Sorry. I was just doin' a little target practice. I thought you told me you didn't have a gun? This was my father's. It's an old war trophy. I just use it to keep in shape. Have you got a permit for it? No. You can apply for one at the station. Come on. What about my gun? Just keep it in a drawer until your permit comes through. We'll uh, we'll keep this between you and me. You got it. Now go get your uniform on. Okay. We got business to do. Thanks! Jake? About time you got here. Look at this. Look! $70,000 worth of staking and surveying. It's all ruined. Is anything missing? Look in the trailer. It was like this when I got here. Here I am trying to create some jobs for this little town and I mean, I'm tryin' to do somethin' for these idiots. Nature rules. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Ecology terrorists. They wanna give the beach back to the pelicans instead of the people. Didn't waste much time did they? Sam, what are you gonna do about this? Mr. winslow, it was probably just a bunch of teenagers. What the hell would you know? Listen, what do you think I'd pay to catch this fellow. - No, we can't watch everything all the time. Well, maybe if you paid a little more attention to your job instead of to your other activities, something like this wouldn't happen. You guys clean this place up! Okay Mr. winslow. Don't you hate guys like winslow? Come into a small town like this, push all the little people around. Got a cigarette? Yeah, sure. Might not be used to them though. Got half a dozen cartons outside of Las Vegas. Five bucks a carton. No frills though. That's cheap. Yeah. Look, why don't you keep the pack? Thanks. You're welcome. I wouldn't mind a piece of that action. I bet she's pretty hot when it counts, huh? I don't think she's available. Yeah. I bet that Jake winslow guy, he's uh, he's pretty possessive, huh? It's a nice cigarette. Too bad they don't sell 'em around here. Yeah. Seems pretty flimsy to me. A couple of cigarettes, a gun, some pictures? I agree. I don't know. Well good, then let's not do it. Wait a minute. Why would anyone believe that Brian would wanna kill Jake? He just came to town, he's a cop. We could make him believe it. But he's gonna deny he did it. Hey, prisons are filled with people who denied they did it. Anyway, I don't think Brian who have to do hard time. Best thing to do is just muddy the waters. Make the situation unclear. This is a small town. There's always gonna be someone who will suspect it was us. How would you feel if Brian was convicted? An innocent man. How would you feel about it? I don't wanna think about it. Sam? What? I wanna be the one to do it. I wanna be the one who kills Jake. It's my problem. I'll take care of it. Okay? If that's what you want. You've got to quit smoking. I feel strange. We gotta do it. Anything interesting? Not really. You know, I wanted to thank you. I feel really comfortable here now. I think I came along just at the right time. Once again, breathe, relax, aim, stop breathing and squeeze. Don't anticipate. Fire. Okay? Okay. Do not aim at the head. Three shots at least in chest. Aim low. Don't forget, it's for support. All right. Pretend it's Jake. What's that? It's a button I pulled from Brian's jacket. Put the gun right up here. You're sure Jake will come here? I know he will. I can wait for him here. No. You don't have to be involved at all. You wait at the party. And you're gonna throw the gun in the beach. Right. And and leave the headlights off till the main highway. Okay. It's your golden moment Carl. Come on. I'm not good at things like this, I... Oh, you silver tongued devil. Come on! Come on, you gotta say somethin'. - No, I can't. All right. Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm off to Mexico and kiss my ass. I like it. No, yeah that's not bad. Mm, and I'm ready to meet the ladies. So the town's yours Brian. You know what to do? Yeah, don't worry. I'll check on you later. All right, let's go. Have a good night. Any luck with the babysitter? No, you go ahead. I know, why don't we take Annie along with us? She's almost asleep Jake. She's got a fever. Are you absolutely certain that you tried everybody? It's all right, you go ahead. I know someone who's gonna be very disappointed that you're not there. Goodnight sweetheart. How 'bout this Sam? There's a lot more people here than I thought. Come on, they're not gonna bite ya. All right. - There's that beautiful big fella. I look like a... - Hey, come on. Get in there. Go on. Hey! Hey. Oh! - Hey. Hey! Mr. winslow? Hi. Now you are just the man I'd like to talk to. Where's Laura? I haven't seen her, is she here yet? Oh, uh she had to stay home tonight. Annie's got a little touch of fever. Oh, I'm sorry. You know something? I have known that wife of yours since she was this high. I can't tell you how much I love that girl. Oh, so dol. Come on! On! Bastard! Look how I hate this drink. Good luck to you down in Mexico, Carl. Thank you. Glad you could make my party. Oh, well thank you. Listen, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to leave early. Annie's not feelin' well and I told Laura I wouldn't stay. Oh, I understand. Look uh, if I don't see you again before I leave I wanna wish you good luck with your development project. Personally I think it sucks but what the hell? It ain't gonna be my business is it? All right, you have a good trip. All right, take it easy now son. I think this party is going so well. I think everybody's having a great time. Say, did you ever find a man? Damn! All right, who's the next victim? Great, come on Sam! Come on in here. Come on. I don't know if I'm ready for this. All right, countdown! Five, four, three, two, one. Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Look, I'm sorry we gotta go two outta three. Two outta three. Come on Sam. Drink some beer. Come on. I'm gonna give you this chance. One more time, that's it. He'll really make the effort this time. Okay. All right, one more time. - Okay, ready? Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one. Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug. Anything wrong Mr. winslow? No. Can I give you a ride or somethin'? Yeah, why not? Good. So where would you like me to drop you Mr. winslow? Out on lighthouse road, that'll be fine. So what happened to your Mercedes? It had a flat tire. Been havin' a whole lotta bad luck this week. Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Yeah! You cheated. You cheated. No, no, I know how to drink. Okay, I'm outta here. Oh, don't be chicken shit Sam. No way. Come on. Come here and sit down. By the way, Carl wanted me to tell you your new construction site, Sam and I have it included in our new rounds. Good. You really enjoy being a deputy? Yeah. You know, any job that lets you carry a gun and kick ass can't be all that bad. Are you sure there's nothin' I can help you with? Don't worry about it. Okay. Sam! Hi Marilyn. Hey, where are you goin'? Anybody here? Who's there? Boo. What the hell are you doin' here? I came to warn you about Laura. You know she and her boyfriend, they had a little plan to kill you tonight. What, are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. I messed around with her engine a bit. You don't have to worry about her. You know the real funny thing? They were gonna try and pin it on me. I almost decided to let them. I mean, it would've been so ironic. Ironic's the word isn't it? The only problem is, I didn't come this far to stand on the sidelines. Hey now look uh, I'm here about a picture and some negatives. I don't care about pictures. Well, we don't have to make a big deal about this. I've got plenty of money. I... - Shut up! Nothing you have could bring back my father. Who are you? I would never give you that satisfaction. Who are you? I'm the past that just caught up with you. Would it help you ought to let you know that Laura and Sam, they're not gonna get away with this either? I guess not. Mr. winslow? This was just not your lucky day. Nice try. Laura! Laura! Oh god. What? Yeah? What's wrong? Look, don't worry I'll, I'll be right on it. Yeah, we'll find him. Okay. Don't worry Laura. Jake's been out playin' around again. Talk to the sheriff then? 30 years, I never saw anything like this. Why don't you go down to Mexico and forget about it? Nah, it's too late now. There's Laura. Laura? I'm afraid you're gonna have to go down to the coroner's office to make a positive identification. I understand. I'll have Brian run you over. Look, I'm real sorry. Come on Sam. I thought I was gonna slide easy into my golden years. It's him. You all right? You know, I don't think it will take us long to find out who did this. What makes you think that? 'Cause there's no such thing as a perfect crime. Most people, they never think it through with enough precision. To commit a perfect murder you need planning, guts and luck. Sure, a lotta people got a plan, apparently anybody's to guts. Practically nobody has luck. What are you tryin' to say? Did you know Sam was seen leavin' Carl's party at the same time Jake did? Let's hope Sam's a lucky man. After you. Hey Sam. Look what I found. Fresh? Yeah. I don't recognize the brand though. Let's send 'em to the lab. What about you? You find anything here? Just a lot of blood. Yeah, tell me about it. Sam, look at that. What? You think it might be somethin'? Odds are it's been here all summer. Not this button. This button came off a winter coat. So? Well, so it was cold last night. Sam? Yeah? Come here, look what I found. Right down there. A luger, a genuine luger. Jeez. Know anybody around here that's got a luger? Uh, Brian. I told him to keep it under wraps till he got his permit. Are you serious? Yeah. You keep this under your hat, you understand? Brian? Yeah. What's he doin' with a luger? It's a terrible thing that happened to your husband. I remember when my dad died. Police, they called it a suicide. But it was really a murder. You see, there was this man. This man robbed a lot of people of their life savings. Left my father there to take the blame. My father couldn't face all his friends, so he killed himself. But you see, it was that other man's fault. He shouldn't have done somethin' and then blamed it on someone else. That's wrong. Don't you think? Hey, look at that car. Come on. Well, I guess that about does it. I really appreciate you doin' this Laura. I know how hard it must've been. May I go home now? Sure. Now, if there's anything I can do to help, you just let me know. Thanks Carl. All right. I'll walk her to her car. It seems to be working. You took a big chance. You too. You all right? No. I better walk the rest of the way by myself. "In the midst of life we are in death. "Of whom may we seek for succour but of thee oh lord? "Before our sins art justly displeased, "yet oh lord god, most holy, oh lord most mighty, "oh holy and most merciful savior, "deliver us not into the bitterest pains of eternal death." "Thou know us lord, the secret of our hearts. "Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer, "but spare us lord, most holy, oh god most mighty. "In sure and certain hope "of the resurrection to eternal life. Through our lord Jesus Christ we commend to almighty god our brother Jacob, and we commit his body to the ground. "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." Lord bless him. Sam? It's Carl. I'll be right there. Hope I'm not interruptin' anything. No. Want a drink, huh? Oh, it's too early in the day for him. How 'bout you? Sure. Yeah, sit down. You sure I'm not botherin' you? No, no. I'm just beat. Yeah, life's a bother ain't it? There I was all set to sail off into the sunset free as a bird. Now I got this god damn albatross around my neck. Oh, you're free to go anytime. I can call in for some help. Yeah. I got a call from Ben pena in ballistics. He confirmed that Brian's gun was fired. You wanna get a warrant? Uh, there's a problem. Turns out Mr. winslow was killed with a .38. I don't get it. Are you sayin' that uh, the luger wasn't the murder weapon? Kinda complicates things doesn't it? Especially since it was your .38 that did the shootin'. How long have we known each other Sam? I don't know. All my life. Where did you go Saturday night after the party? I took a walk outside just to clear my head. I saw Mary Ellen on the way out. I know. You think I did this don't you? I'm tryin' not to think anything. Well shit Carl I can't believe this! Did you do it, son? No. I hope that's the truth. I gotta go. Laura! Laura! Laura! What the hell are you trying to pull? You shouldn't be here. I trusted you! And I trusted you. Yeah? How much you gettin' to be Jake's widow? What are you talking about? Oh, does this make it any clearer, huh? The new buttons. Brilliant touch! And then switchin' the guns! Fuckin' genius! Nobody asked you to kill him. I didn't kill him. I was trying to stop you. What are you talking about? I didn't do it Sam! I never left the house, the car wouldn't start. Tell them to someone who will believe you. Goodbye Brian. Didn't expect to see you here. There's no other place to go. You're a grown man. You can make your own decisions. Oh shit. What the hell you laughin' at? Is that it Carl? Is that the sum total of the advice you're always trying to give me? I mean don't you think it's a little late in the day for that now? Would you just take it easy? No, I'm gonna give you some of my own advice! A product of Sam wayburn's experience. Don't want anything 'cause you're not gonna get it. I mean, it's all a bunch of bullshit anyway. Oh, Sam that's such dark talk. Oh shit Carl! What world are you livin' in? You put 30 years in and all you've got to look forward to is some fuckin' whore and a handful of margaritas. That's about enough of that okay? Yeah, how's the case goin', huh? Have you got enough evidence yet? Huh? Look, I'm workin' on it okay? Come on, do it Carl! Arrest me, come on! I'm sorry. Sam? Yeah? Go home, pack and leave. Take Laura with you if you want. Hell, you can take my boat for all I care. Whatever happens to you outside of Saint alba, is none of my concern. I don't even wanna know about it. Okay. What are you doin'? - Don't say anything. What are you doin'? Shh. Carl? Carl? Are you all right? Just thinkin' what a lousy world this is. I'll drink to that. I didn't kill Jake. Okay, I believe you. Now you've got to believe me. I didn't kill him either. God, I love you. It was Brian. He was the only one. He had the keys to the gun cabinet, and the buttons were off of his jacket. But why? Why Brian? Well, my momma always said that the best way to chase your troubles away is to do a little work in the kitchen. So, I volunteer. What can I do? Well, let's see. How would you like to make the salad? I can do that. I'm sure you can. What do I do? Give it one of these. What do I do then? Just crank it right outta there. Crank it. Ta da. You tricky little devil you. I got a terrific recipe for trout in that book. Oh, you don't need a recipe. Just uh, you know, a little lemon, pepper, fire her up. Maybe I should let you do this operation. Well, I can do that. Do it. See the telex? Cop talk. That's good. - Still fresh? Uh huh. - Okay. Uh, how about some cayenne pepper on it? Carl? What do you say? What do you see? What is it? It's a message from a dead man. Hi Sam. How you doin'? Throw your gun over here. Come on. Now! You know the law in this town's got a real poor sense of justice. It's hopeless enough to make an honest man wanna quit. It was you. Yeah. Sure was. Why? Nothin' big. Somethin' to do with my old man. Jake killed him. Don't be a fool Brian. You're not gonna get away with this. Sam, you tried to set me up. You're not gonna get away with that. Stop! Nobody in this town even knows who I am Sam. All I have to do is leave. We're havin' fun now! Run! Shit. Come on Sam! Sam! Justice rules. You sure? One last throw? I'll see you around. You wouldn't have killed him would you?
