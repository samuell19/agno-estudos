1957 - COLD WAR INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS The next stop is Broad Street. Broad Street will be next. Upstairs. This way. He did not come up this way. Anything. He is not up here. Go back down. Excuse me. Go ahead and park around the corner. Visitors. Do you mind if I fetch my teeth? Colonel, would you turn around, please? Sit down on the bed. Let us go. They are in the... The teeth are in the on the sink. Look at me. We are agents... from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Look at me! I am talking to you. We have received information... concerning your involvement in espionage. You can either cooperate with us right now, or, you will be under arrest. Do you understand, Colonel? No, not really. Why do you keep calling me "Colonel"? You need to get dressed. We have to search your apartment. Would you mind if I cleaned my palette? The paints, it will be ruined otherwise. It is just behind you there. I have a cloth myself. Thank you. Start searching the place. Thank you. All right! Search the mattress, the bed, the floorboards, his chair. Would you put that in the ashtray? On the window still there. Take a good look at that desk. Let us see the desk. Would you not want to get this ruined? Do not you say "my guy." He is not "my guy." Yes, he is "your guy." Who about are we talking? We are talking about a guy whom did my client? So, do not make him "my guy." Okay, fine. My point is, the guy insured by your client, He does not deny that any of these things happened. "These... These things"? Yes, these five things. Wait, hold it, and hold it, and hold it. Not five things. One thing. Clearly, it is five things. Well, I am sorry, It is not clear to me. Five things? Explain it to me. It is self-evident. Okay, and then tell me what happened. Tell me the story in a way that makes sense for five things. Fine, absolutely. Your guy is... Not my guy. Insured by my client. The guy insured by your client... is driving down State Highway 19. When he loses control of his car and hits my five guys. The five people who hired me to represent them. Because you are not honoring your claim. You mean my client is not honoring the claim, the insurance company? Mr. Donovan, we are all clear who is who, here? Except my client honors every claim. They do, Mr. Bates. Every single legitimate claim, up to the limit of their liability. Which is $100,000 per accident? In the case of this man's policy. And, this is one claim. According to your description: "He hit my five guys." The guy insured by my client had one accident. One, one, one. Losing control of the car and hitting five motorcyclists. From their point of view, five things happened. Look, Bob. May I Bob? "Jim." If I go, bowling and I throw a strike, one thing happened. Ten things did not happen. Jim, my people are not bowling pins. As much as your guy may have treated them as such. If... Let me finish. Let me finish. If your house is insured for $100,000. And, a tornado carries it away, it carried away one house. It did not pick up every stick of furniture. And, destroy it in a separate incident. If that is what, you are saying, Then, there is never any limit to our liability. That is the end of the insurance business. Then, Bob nobody is safe. Waters, Cowan and Donovan. How may I direct your call? Good morning, Mr. Donovan! Good morning, Alison! I moved your 9:00 a.m. with Prudential, Sir. Why did you do that? I asked to her do. Is everything all right, Tom? Why do not you leave your stuff with Alison, and come on inside? Something important has come up. Somebody is here to see us. Natalie is getting your coffee. Nescafe, cream, two lumps. Right? That is right. Thanks. - Lynn! - Jim! Nice to see you again. How is the family? Great, good. Thanks. How is Annie? Homicide. We had the in-laws for the holiday. If she acts on it, she will have good representation. Now, what is up? Okay, here is the thing. The Soviet spy who caught, we want you to defend him. Here is the indictment. Wow! I am not sure. I want to pick that up. The accused does not know any lawyers. The federal court tossed it into our lap. The Bar Committee took a vote. You are the unanimous choice. It is important to us. It is important to our country, Jim. That this man is getting a fair chance. American justice will be on trial. Of course! When you put it that way. It is an honor asked. But, Lynn, I am an insurances lawyer. I have not done criminal work in years. It is like riding a bike. Is not it? You distinguished yourself at Nuremberg. I was on the prosecution team. Not the point. You are no stranger to criminal law. Jim, look at the situation. The man reviled publicly. And, I will be, too. Yes, in quarters that is more ignorant. That is exactly why this has done, and, capably done. It cannot look like our justice system, tosses people on the ash heap. Suppose I will do. As the evidence, looks like. Very overwhelming. Great. Great. Everyone will hate me but at least I will lose. What do you think, Tom? The firm will suffer. I have work here. I think it is a patriotic duty. It is an important mission. I told Lynn, the firm could not say no. You would have a tough time saying no, too. I think you have to defend the son of a bitch. You are doing it. What are you doing? Defending Abel, the Soviet spy. I may. I have to speak to... Wait! How do you know? Did they post it on the bulletin board? No, I... I was talking to Richard Earl. Look, if I do this, I am going to need your help. Can you work tonight? I have a dinner date, Sir. It is Tuesday, right. Yeah, no, I am free, completely free. Thank you, Sir. It is also an honor. And, the Bar Association asked me... because they want to show that even a spy, gets a capable advocate. Maybe it is the kind of honor without we could do. Honey, what are you doing in home? I have stood up. That is despicable. Who is this knot-head? I would rather not to say. Sit down. We just started. People are scared. They are building bomb shelters to protect themselves. - From people like this man. - Ok. I go to the store, people are buying canned food and Potassium tablets. It is all about this man, and what represents. He is a threat to all of us. A traitor. - Who is a traitor? - The Rosenberg was traitor. Who were they? They gave atomic secrets to the Russians. They were Americans. They betrayed their country. You cannot accuse Abel of being a traitor. He is not an American. Listen to yourself. You are defending him already. You are rehearsing it on me. You said you were just thinking about taking it. I am just thinking about it, just very hard. Everyone deserves a defense. Every guy matters. Jim, what do we deserve? Do you know how people will look at us? Family man is trying to free a traitor. He is not a traitor, Mary. Yes, yes. Roger, get that! He is not a traitor. Why do I have to do all the work? - You wait until us say grace. - I am hungry! He is about the most unpopular man in this country. You are trying to take the second place! Yeah, and I am third. - Carol, you are dating wrong guy. - I want eat. Mary, do not make this argument. When we are not having an argument. You are against him. I am for him. No. I am not for him. I am not for the Russians spying on us. I am for his right to have a defense in a court of law. This is why they call it a court of law. Sorry, Sir. I did not mean to interrupt dinner. A court of law... Hey, Doug. No. Not at all. Hello, Doug. Jim was just flailing. I am not flailing. Go ahead, Doug. You can join us for dinner. We are having meatloaf tonight. You came over here to help Jim think about... Whether is he taking the case? We are taking it! It is exciting, is not it? Lord, we thank thee for blessings. We are about to receive. Thy bounty through Christ, our Lord. Amen. Good morning, Sir. My name is Jim Donovan. These are my credentials. I am a partner in Waters, Cowan and Donovan. I had been admitted to the New York Bar in 1941. You had charged with 3 counts and 19 overt acts, conspiracy to transmit United States defense, atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. Conspiracy to gather secrets. And, failing to register as a foreign agent. Have many foreign agents register? If you do not mind my asking, Sir. Since your arrest. Where have you been? I could not say certainly. You do not know. They drove me to an airport. And, put me on a plane, took me off the plane. Somewhere hot. It is hot here. Hotter, very humid. They put me in a room. You was beaten. No. I talked. Offers was made. What do you mean? Offers of employment, to work for your government. Told if I cooperated, no further charges would be made against me. They would give me money. And, you declined? As you see. Of course! I cannot endorse that. I feel duty-bound to urge you, to cooperate with the U.S. government. I said no. Perhaps you could relay to your friends at the CIA that I meant it. No, no, no. I am not. I do not work for the agency. I do not work for the government. I am here to offer my services as your legal counsel. If you accept them as such, I work for you. If I accept you. Are you good on what you do? Yeah. Yeah, I am very good. Have you represented many accused spies? No, not yet. This will be the first for both. Yes. All right! "All right"? You accept. Yes, all right! Good, okay. Let us start here. If you are firm in your resolve it, not to cooperate with the U.S. government... I am. Yeah. Then do not talk to anybody else about your case. Inside of government or outside. Except to me, to the extent that you trust me. I have a mandate to serve you. Nobody else does. Frankly, everybody else has an interest... in sending you to the electric chair. All right! You do not seem alarmed. Would it help? I would like materials to draw. That is not possible. A pencil, a piece of paper. Cigarettes. Please? Mr. Donovan, you is a man like me, doing the same for your country. If they were caught... I am sure that you wish them treated well. What is your name? Francis Gary Powers. Rank, service? First Lieutenant, United States Air Force. Do you have any association? With the Soviet Union, Lieutenant Powers. Are you kidding? Just answer the questions, lieutenant. Yes, no, or as simply as you can. Do you have any association with the Soviet Union? Hell, no. Do you know why you are here? Is that a no? Yes. I mean... No. It is just "no." Yes. I have absolutely no idea why I am here. Eyes front, Lieutenant. Yes, sir. How would you do in there, Gary? Very good. I think. I got my name right. You probably outscored Shin, then. Who is winning? That would be me. Well, deal me in. These are all mine, then. I told you boys not to play with him. Okay, drivers. Here is the deal. You selected for a mission. Which you are not to discuss. With anyone outside of this room. No one. I do not care who you trust. Wife, mother, sweetheart. The good Lord when you pray at night. You do not tell any of them anything. Of what I am about to tell you. Each of drivers has met certain qualifications. High-level security clearance. Exceptional pilot ratings... in excess of the required hour's flight time... in a single-seat aircraft. We are engaged in a war. A war does in this moment, not involve men-at-arms. It involves information. You will be collecting information. You will be gathering intelligence about the enemy. The intelligence you gather could give us the upper hand... in a full thermonuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. Or it could prevent one. For public purposes, as far as your wife or mother. Or, sweetheart, the good Lord, your mission does not exist. If it does not exist. You do not exist. You cannot be shot down. You cannot be captured. You work for the CIA now. Jim, I heard your guy is speaking with a phony accent. Does he keep this up all the time? Actually, I am sure that is just the way he talks. He has the Russian name. However, a British passport. I doubt that is genuine. So, Jim, where are we? I see here... Yes. Judge, you see... I just do not think that three weeks are going to do it. We got a massive amount of evidence, as you know. Do you want to postpone? Six weeks. I mean, there is just myself and, my associate. Jim, is this serious? Sir? Is this serious? Yes. Yes, indeed it is. You can see in the file. Jim, this man is a Soviet spy. - Allegedly. - Come on! Counselor! Your Honor. Of course, I salute you. We all salute you for taking on a thankless task. This man has due process. Let us not kid each other. He will receive a capable defense. And, God willing. He will be convicted. Come on! Counselor. Let us not play games with this. Not in my courtroom. We have a date. And, we are going to trial. Taxi! Taxi! I see your light on! Son of a bitch! You cannot wait to get back to Manhattan. His light was on, right? Son of a bitch! Against their level of comfort. The statute has not changed. Excuse me, Sir. Pardon me. Sorry. Mr. Donovan? What? What? CIA. Yeah. I just wanted to chat. How is the case going? The case is going great, could not be better. Has your guy talked? Excuse me. You met him. Has he talked? Has he said anything yet? We are not having this conversation. No. Of course not. No. I mean. We really are not having it. You are asking me to violate attorney-client privilege. Come on! Counselor. You know, I wish people like you. Would stop saying: "Come on! Counselor." I did not like it the first time it happened today. A judge said it to me twice. And, more I hear it, more I do not like it. Ok. Listen. I understand attorney-client privilege. I understand all the legal competitiveness. I understand that is how you make a living. I am talking to you about something else. The security of your country. And, I am sorry if the way I put it offends you. We need to know. What is Abel telling to you? Do you understand me, Donovan? We need to know. You do not go with "Boy Scout" on me. We do not have a rulebook, here. You are Agent Hoffman, yeah. Yeah. German extraction. Yeah, so? My name is Donovan. Irish. Both sides, mother and father. I am Irish. You are German. What makes us both Americans? Just one thing. One, one, one. The rulebook. We call it the Constitution. And, we agree to the rules. That is what makes us Americans. It is all that makes us Americans. So, do not tell me there is no rulebook. And, do not nod at me like that, you son of a bitch! Do we need to worry about you? Not if I have been left alone to do my job. From this moment, forward. You will not refer to the U-2 as a spy plane. Or, reconnaissance aircraft. You will refer to it as: "The Article." The Article has an 80-foot wingspan. A single Pratt powers and Whitney J57 P-37 engine. 10,000 pounds of thrust. A maximum speed of 430 miles an hour. She may not be quick, but at your cruising altitude of 70,000 feet, nothing will come close to you. 70,000? The idea is the enemy does not even, know you are there. It looks somewhat flimsy. Every extra pound of weight costs a foot in altitude. We need to accommodate the cameras. That is a 4,500-millimeter lens, times three. A pin-sharp panoramic camera. Four times as powerful as any aerial reconnaissance cameras we have ever used. You are going taking pictures, many pictures. At 70,000 feet. The Article can photograph. 2,000 square miles of territories in one pass. Now, drivers, give the Agent Sumner your undivided attention. The items you will need on your mission is all over here. B camera, revere 8 model 40 magazine, Keystone Capri K-25, silver. All how handle shaving brush. Complete set of cipher tablets on edible silver, foil. Specialist photographic equipment. Yeah. We get the idea. Thank you. Excuse me. Agent Bosco. "Blasco." Sir. There seems to be a subsection to this list here. Most of this stuff came from his studio. But, the rest is from the hotel room he was holed up in. Where we found him. The hotel room you searched. Yeah. Can I see the warrant? What? Yeah, explain this to me. There was a warrant. There was a warrant. A civil detention writ for the arrest of an alien, but, there was no search warrant, for suspicion of criminal activity. So, the search, and the evidence. That is the fruit of that search, That is all tainted, and should not be admitted. What protections he is due, your honor. The man is not... Who is the man? He is Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. He is a Soviet citizen. He is not an American. 1886, Wick Wo vs. Hopkins. The court held that even aliens, in case Chinese immigrants, could not be held to answer for a crime without due process of law, including any, alien that entered the country illegally. The Department of Justice... has its first allegiance to the United States. I do not see how an alien, if he is here illegally, how he suffered deprivation of rights. Rights as what? An American? Rights as what, Counselor? We are in a battle for civilization. This Russian spy came here to threaten our way of life. Now, I have a courtroom of people waiting. Get out there, sit beside the Russian. Let us get this over and done. And, your motion is denied. He should take some insurance out on himself. How did we do? In there. Not too good. Apparently, you are not an American citizen. That is true. And according to your boss. You are not a Soviet citizen either. Well, the boss is not always, right. He is always the boss. Do you never worry? Would it help? All rise! "I pledge allegiance to the Flag." "Of the United States of America." "And to the Republic for which it stands." "One Nation under God, indivisible." "With liberty and justice for all." First, you have to know what happens, when an atomic bomb explodes. There is a bright flash, brighter than the sun. It can smash buildings, break windows all over town. But if you are in shelter and cover like Bert, you will be much safer. There are two kinds of attack, with warning, without any warning. What is going on in here? Okay, Dad. This is very important. When the war begins, the first thing, they do... Is cut off all the water, and, all the electricity. The first thing we should do is keep filled, use the shower in your room, use the sink downstairs, the garden hose outside. Those are good ideas. Roger, I do not see this. As being something, you have to worry. Yeah, but when you hear the sirens. There may not be enough time to fill the tub and the sinks. Not will have any sirens. What is this? When the bomb comes, the Reds will aim go for the Empire State Building. But, the bomb goes off at 10,000 feet up. In Life magazine, it is called an air burst. And, if the bomb is 50 megatons. The blast wave goes out and out and out. And, melts everything from here to here. Including where we live. Yeah. Right there. You know Roger, no one is dropping Atomic bombs on us. The Russians want to. You know that Russian guy, you are defending. He is here to get things ready. For the people who drop the bombs. No. No, he is not... Not is here for that. He is not even Russian. He was born, we think, in Northern England. Yeah. But, he is a spy for Russia. I do not even understand. What are you doing? You are not a Communist. So, why are you defending one? Well, because it is my job. It never used to be. In the case of the United States of America, versus Rudolf Abel. As to the first count in the indictment. How do you find the defendant? Guilty or not guilty? Guilty. As to the second count? Guilty. As to the third count? Guilty. Your honor. I make a motion to set aside these guilty verdicts. Against the weight of evidence. Denied. The jury discharged. Thank you. I would like to add that, if I were one of you. I would have reached the same verdict. Sentencing will be. November 15. The death sentence is not a foregone conclusion. Do not worry. I am not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan. Although. It would not be my first choice. You left this behind. Thank you. Thank you very much! You have never asked me, if the charges were true. If I am indeed a spy. This is how we do it. The case against you matters. Making them prove it matters. The fiction is... Whether you did it or not does not matter. The state has to prove it, that you are a spy. You are not curious. No, not really. I always assumed you were an artist. My wife, she is the artist. She is a musician. In the Children's Orchestra of Moscow. What instrument? The Harp. Then, she is an Angel. Standing there like that, you remind me a man,. Who used to come to our house. When I was young. My father used to say: "Watch this man." I did every time he came. And, never once. He did anything remarkable. And, I remind you of him. This one time, I was about the age of your son. Our house overrun by partisan border guards. Dozens of them. My father was beaten and my mother was beaten. This man, my father's friend, he was beaten. I watched this man. Every time they hit him. He stood back up again. They hit him harder. Still, he gets back on his feet. I think because of this, they stopped beating him. They let him alive. I remember them saying it. It means like: "Standing man." "Standing man." - Hello, Jim! - Millie, you are a vision. Mortie is busy getting ready. Come on in. - Scotch, Jim? - Yes, please. Thank you. Just a drop of water. Your honor. Hello, Jim! Just going out. I got a few minutes though. March of Dimes thing. Millie is active. Well, thank you for seeing me. I just wanted to give you my two cents on the sentencing. And, I thought maybe, I should pester you at home. As not all of my points are narrowly legal. Yeah. It is that kind of case. I hope I was not too scratchy during the trial. It is exactly what you say. Nothing about this is narrowly legal. There are bigger issues. Bigger issues! Thank you, thank you. Sir? I think it could be considered. In the best interests of the United States. That Abel remains alive. Why? I am not saying, I made up my mind. But if he was going to cooperate, work with the government. He would have done it already. - True, but the issue here. - You cannot. Excuse me. You cannot say it is in the best interest of the United States. That he spend the rest of his days in a prison cell. How is this national interest? Not the incarceration itself, Sir. It is possible in the near future. An American of equivalent rank. Might be captured by Soviet Russia. We might want to have someone to trade. Wow! That sounds like what-ifs. You could do that until the cows come home. It is my business, what-ifs. I am in insurance. And, there is nothing implausible about this one. It is entirely really, of what could happen. It is the kind of probability for people buys insurance. If we send this guy to his death. We leave ourselves wide open. No policy in our back pocket, for the day the storm comes. Nice speech. Sir, there is also the humanitarian an argument. Should he die for doing the job they sent him to do? All right! Counselor. I have to run. Good see you, Jim. I will walk you out. All rise! The United States District Court. For the Eastern District of New York is now in session. The honorable Mortimer Byers presiding. Be seated. The defendant will please rise. In the measured judgment of this court, the following sentence, based upon the jury's verdict of guilty. As to each count of the indictment, is believe to meet the test, which has stated. Pursuant to the verdict of guilty as to all counts. The defendant is committed to the custody, of the Attorney General of the United States. For imprisonment in a federal institution, to be selected by him for a period of 30 years. Marshals, you may take the defendant into custody. No... No electrocution? No. No, no. Why are not we hanging him? In the name of God. Why are not we hanging him? Sit down! He is a spy! He is killing us with his lies! In the name of God. Why are not we hanging him? That is right! He is a spy! Mr. Donovan? Mr. Donovan? - Just one question. - Just one question, Sir. My hat! My hat! Nobody here has a comment. Mr. and Mrs. Donovan are not answering questions. How do you feel now? This national nightmare is over. Mr. Donovan, are you happy with the verdict? We are... We are firm in case on appeal. - Appeal? - Appeal, yes. Jim, you did a great job. You fulfilled your mandate and, then some. The man is a spy. The verdict is correct and there is no reason to appeal it? There is ample procedural reason. We know the search is tainted. Fourth Amendment issues. Will always weigh more heavily in an appellate forum. We have a good shot. What about the goddamn are you talking? We were supposed to show he had a capable defense, which we did. Why are you citing the goddamn constitution at me? Tom, if you look me in the eye. And, tell me we do not have grounds, for an appeal, I will drop it right now. I am not saying that, you know what I am saying. Tom is saying there is a cost to these things. That is right. A cost to both your family and your firm. I missed music. They checked the radio to make sure there was no transmitter in it. I am sure they did. That is a very great artist, Shostakovitch. I think. Our strongest grounds for reversal, are constitutional. Our best chance is if the Supreme Court agrees to review your case. Jim. You should be careful. Careful. 77 Sunset Strip. Edward Byrnes. 77 Sunset Strip. And Richard Long. Good morning, Suzanne. Good morning, Dick. There is a special delivery letter here for you. Her. Mom! What in the God's name happened. Honey, are you all right? - Mom! - Are you hurt? I have her to upstairs! - Are you all right? - I sat with my back against the wall, Dad! Are you okay? Are you all right? Dad, I sat with my back against the wall! - Good, good. - Away from the windows! Good, good, good. Good boy, good boy, good boy. It is okay. It is all right! It is all right! They are gone. They are gone. They are cowards. They are gone. We have detectives canvassing in the neighborhood. Maybe we will find a description of the car. I do not think It is very likely. We are going to need protection. I have instructions to leave two cars here. It will be very obvious. For how long. I have to be in Washington later on this week. What are you doing? What are you doing to your family? Pardon me, Officer. You are still defending this guy. Why are you fighting for him? Okay. Knock that off, Officer. I will knock off nothing. I was in the third wave at Omaha Beach. I did my time in the service. I was fighting these people. Are you defending them? Why do not you just do your job as an officer of the law? Okay, I am sorry. Let us go outside. Come on! What do you know? Just forget him. What am I not getting here? Outside, Officer. I am sorry. Defending a commie spy. Jesus! Do you feel you deserve this, Sir? Should it become necessary? To abandon the aircraft over Soviet territory. Then, there is a two and a half-pound explosive charge, contained within the fuselage. First, you activate the circuits. But to start the 70-second timer. You need to flip the switch marked: "Destruct." It is imperative these flights remain a secret. And, this equipment does not fall into enemy hands. What about us? I do not know if you are kidding, Lieutenant Powers. I am not. What do you know about the plane, is as secret as the plane itself. If capture is a foregone conclusion. You go down with your plane. Now, if you think, you can ditch and get away. If you are, close enough to a border, fine. You know the ejection protocol. But, if you ditch. You bring the dollar with you. There is a pin inside. You scratch your skin anywhere, it is instantaneous. If you think, you will be captured... You use it. Drivers do you understand me? Spend the dollar. Mr. Chief of Justice, may it please the court? The "Cold War" is not just a phrase. Your Honor. It is not just a figure of speech. Truly, a battle is being fought, between two competing views of the world. I contend that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. "Colonel Abel," as he was called. Even by the man who arrested him. Is our foe in that battle? Auxiliary power. Connected and on. Oxygen seat pack supply. Supply at 1,800. Inverter? On, light out. He was treated as a combatant in that war. Until it no longer suited our government to treat him. Accordingly. He not gave the protections. We give our own citizens. He subjected to treatment that, however appropriate for a suspected enemy. It was not appropriate to a suspected criminal. Fuel transfer? Transfer switch off. Destructor? Destructor safety. Climb data card. Installed in aircraft. I know this man. If the charge is true, he serves a foreign power but he serves it faithfully. If he is a soldier in the opposing army, he is a good soldier. He has not fled the field of battle to save himself. He has refused to serve his captor. He has refused to betray his cause. He has refused to take the cowards' way out. The coward must abandon his dignity. Before he abandons the field of battle. That Rudolf Abel will never do. Should not we? By give him the full benefit. Of the rights that define our system of government. Show this man who we are. Who we are. Is that the greatest weapon? We have in this Cold War. Will we stand by our cause less resolutely? Than he stands by his. The President announced. That a NASA weather plane disappeared four days ago north of Turkey. And, the Space Administration fears. That its pilot died in the crash. Radar showed the plane wandering off course. Deep into Soviet territory before contact was lost, complicated any effort to recover it. Or the remains of the pilot. Now the news out of Washington. In a close vote today. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. Of Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel. Five votes to four. The case presented civil liberties issues. According to the Russian's lawyer, James B. Donovan. When asked how he felt about today's loss, Mr. Donovan simply said: "Tired." I will have more news for you after this message. Styling tricks. It is over. See the new, exciting styling tricks. You... Marty? I will be damned if I can find the file on that Prudential case. I... Mr. Waters had moved it over to Jack Elwes's office. Along with the first draft of the appeal. He did. Yeah. He redrafted and filed that last week while you were in Washington. How long have we been together? You act as if I have never closed a deal. Set up a meeting somewhere fancy. I am betting Mr. Young would like some of the finer things. New York has to offer. I want you to give me the summary of... Do you know anyone from Leipzig? "Leipzig." Am I getting hate mail from Germany now? From East Germany. Is it your new one? No. No, no, no, no. She pretends to be but it is not even a good pretense. "I am taking this liberty to write to you." "After having learned from the newspapers." "About your most humane attitude." "Towards my beloved husband, Rudolf Abel." Do I write back? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is the next move when you do not know the game? Francis Gary Powers. "On the strength of Article 2 of the U.S.S.R. law." "On criminal responsibility for state crimes." "To 10 years of confinement." "The first three years to be served in the prison." "The term of the punishment," "including preliminary detention." "It shall be counted from May 1," "nineteen hundred and sixty." Mr. Donovan. Thank you so much for coming. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Dulles. It is an honor, Sir. Nescafe, cream, two lumps. Thank you. Okay, this letter you received, seems clear that the Soviets are making an overture here. They are doing it through East Germany. Because they still do not want to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen. Much less a Soviet spy. So... Lot of fiction is going on. Yes, Sir, but you know end. They got our guy, our spy pilot. We have their guy. Prisoner exchange, I think that is what they are after. Which could hardly be a surprise to you, Counselor? It is an eventuality. I think you foresaw. Yes. I sure did, and I am so rarely right. Congratulations Red-letter day. Now, we have our man over there. Powers. Good man, but with a head full of classified information. Abel has a head full of classified information, too. He has not given us a lick. Sir takes it from me. He will not. Yes, we know that, but the Russians do not. They want their man back before he cracks. We want Powers back for the same reasons. I think you are saying, Sir... That might be a successful conclusion for everyone. Yes, if we indulge their fiction. We want you to negotiate the swap. Because you are a private citizen. It is not governments talking. They do not acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen. We do not acknowledge East Germany as a sovereign country. We have not recognized East Berlin. Since it annexed by the Soviets in 45. I act as a negotiator, representing... You are not representing anybody. Not a government official. You have no official standing. So, some fiction on our side as well. Correct. This means, of course, you cannot rely on any acknowledgment. Or, help if things go south. CIA cannot be responsible. We cannot be embarrassed. Where do they want this negotiation to take place? There. "There"? East Berlin. Well, is not East Berlin getting rather...? Yes, the place is getting complicated. Yeah, complicated. The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months. To try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors. It has not worked. We have intelligence to suggest. They may go one-step further. And, well off the entire Eastern sector. Okay, that is it briefly. The decision is entirely yours. You need time to kick around it. No. No. I do not. Fine. Fine. Best this all remains confidential. Let us not discuss any of this with Mary or anyone else. Share the correspondence only with us. Let us know what they want to do and when. I have no client, no wife and no country. Do not know what for I am doing or when or who? You are doing it for your country. But, your country does not know that yet. What about my client, the other guy in this equation? My guy? Your guy? You mean the Russian. He is not your guy anymore, Counselor. Your guy is Francis Gary Powers now. What do I tell to Rudolf Abel? Tell him not to drop dead. Professor? Professor? Papa went to university. You should not be here, Frederic. They are having classes today. He went to see where he goes. What are you doing here? I came to get you, and your father. You have to come with me. You might not get out tomorrow. Just... Just leave. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave. Right now. Go back. Go back. I will be okay. I am American. Go back. Go back to your father. We will find another way. Go. Hey. Sir. Hi. Papers, please. The Student Frederic Pryor. Yes, student. What kind of photos? My name is Frederic Pryor. I am an economics student. It is my dissertation. My thesis. You see. Look, look. "The foreign trade system of the European Communist nations." It was a lot of work. No. That is my only copy. No! Tell me something. It came up at the last minute. They have offices in London. These clients. Not my idea. Scotland, this fishing expedition. What kind of fishing trip, Jim? Salmon fishing. Just tell me that you are not going to be in any danger. This is just a routine business trip. I will not worry. I need my passport. Just give me something to hold on. I do not even care if it is the truth. I am doing this for us. Mr. Michener here is your Berlin escort. He is an attache with the U.S. embassy. It has gotten goddamn complicated. As you know, the last letter from Mrs. Abel. Whoever she is, talks about a lawyer in East Berlin. Mr. Vogel, whoever he is, representing her interests, she says. Yeah. Vogel says. He has gone to the Russian embassy in East Berlin. They may be ready to trade Abel for Powers. No one knows who is who. Essentially, they are Russian, right. Well! Soviet. We think so. What do you mean? Could we turn up the heat in here? There is a wrinkle. They might try to throw you a curve ball. Try to get you to accept another prisoner other than Powers. Another American? The East German Stasis picked up an American student. Frederic Pryor. The kid they found on the wrong side of the Wall. He is a graduate student of Yale. Came over here to study economics. They are making noises about trying this kid for espionage. Grave offense, capital crime. Vogel got in touch with us, said he represents Pryor. Wait a minute! Vogel represents Mrs. Abel and this kid? Yeah, he is busy. What is he? Vogel is East German or Russian? Try to figure it out when you meet him. At Russian embassy, East Berlin, noon tomorrow. Hoffman will show you how to get there. Wait! Show me how to get there. I am going to have an escort. Right? That was the plan but as I said, there is a wrinkle. I will not be taking you. Decision has made. No U.S. government personnel are to cross the border until further notice. - Why? - It is too dangerous. The East Germans grabbed this kid. There is a degree of impunity. We had not anticipated. The point is the East German agenda and the Russian agenda. May not be the same thing. Try to figure it out and, act accordingly. Try to make a deal. Powers for Abel. What about this college kid, Pryor? Do not you fall for that? We can get him out another time. Powers is the whole ball game. Where is your room? I will be staying at the Hilton. It is not far. This is a number here in West Berlin. Memorize it, and give it back to me. No, no. I... I mean, now. The Soviets keep cutting the international lines. Local calls are okay. Someone will pick up day and night. Now, this docket attached to your passport will serve as your ticket. Into and out of the Eastern Soviet sector. The meeting with Vogel is set for noon tomorrow. There are only a few routes left to the East. You take the S-Ban, the station. We showed you on the way in. You are going to get off at the Friedrichstrasse station here. Walk to the Soviet embassy on Under den Linden here. Look at the map now. You should not take it with you. You are looking at a map. You are an American. You are a spy. You could well detain. Just avoid interacting with people generally. You do not... You do not belong, so do not stick out. Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart. There are gangs. And, rule of law is less firm established over there. Definitely stay away from the Wall. On their side, there is a line. Cleared of buildings along the Wall. They call it the "Death Line." Cross it and you will shot. Where is there any outcome here? I am not either detained or shot. You do not worry too much, about what Michener said. No. I am worried about what you are saying. This kid, Pryor. That the East Germans have. How old is he? Twenty-five. Why? Same age as Dougie. Who? An associate of mine. Frederic Pryor. Okay, okay, okay. We apologize if this offends. Coat? - Do you understand English? - Yes, Sir. I am James Donovan. I am here to meet a Mr. Vogel. Mr. Vogel. He does not work here. I am just supposed to meet him. That is all I know. Mr. Donovan! We finally meet you. I am Helen Abel. - How is my husband? - He is fine. How is my Rudolf? As good as, he can be expected. We will get him back. Yes. - This is our daughter. - How do you do? Lydia. Are you Mr. Vogel? No, no, no! I am not Vogel. I am Drew's cousin. This is Rudolf's beloved Drew's cousin. - Yes. Drew's cousin. - I am Drew's cousin. Drew's cousin, yes. I am Helen Abel. When will you see him? When will your government releases him? I am a little lost here. I am supposed to meet a Mr. Vogel. Mr. Vogel is our lawyer. We were supposed to negotiate the exchange. - Do you bring Rudolf here? - Yes, yes, bring him here. It does not happen unilaterally. Do you understand? It has to be an exchange. Not here. Mr. Donovan? Mr. Vogel? No, no, no. Goodness. My name is Schischkin. Ivan Schischkin. I am the second secretary of the Soviet embassy. It would not be appropriate for Mr. Vogel to join us. He is a German national. You are not here to... To facilitate this meeting. Perhaps Mrs. Abel, would like to compose her privately? And let Mr. Donovan and me to talk. Thank you. - So, I am confused. - Yes. I do not care whom I talk to... If it is about an exchange of personnel. Are you the person to talk? Yes, yes, yes, of course! We should talk. Please, have a seat Mr. Donovan. How did you arrive to the Eastern sector? The train. The S-Ban. You were alone. Yeah. You are credentialed. Now, you must know about me, Sir. I am a private citizen. I am a lawyer in Brooklyn in the United States. I have taken time out of my busy schedule. To help my client, Rudolf Abel. I authorized to arrange an exchange of Abel. For Francis Gary Powers. This is a full pardon of Abel. That will be signed when the exchange actually takes place. This is the only reason I am here. I hope and expect to make this arrangement quickly. Abel for Francis Gary Powers. And, Frederic Pryor. We do not have Pryor. No? You do not! I have heard of Pryor, he has held, by the German Democratic Republic. Not by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I will tell you the first problem. The names of your countries are too long. Yes, yes. If we release Powers. It is only to promote a good will... Between our countries. So, it cannot be an exchange. Perhaps... Perhaps you could release Abel. As a token of good will to our friends in Germany. Then, some months later. We would release Powers. - There is an idea. - No. That Just will not work for us at all. We need this to be an exchange. You can call it what you want... But an exchange it must be. We can have Abel here within 48 hours. We need Powers at the same time. We give you Abel. This is... Can we call this the "impatient plan"? You can call it whatever you want. I can relay your impatient plan to Moscow. See what they say... They will wonder why so impatient. Because I have a cold. I do not live in Berlin. I want to go home. They will think... "Well, the Americans must have gotten..." "All the information that Abel had to give." "And now they are impatient to trade him." "Hoping to get in return this man Powers." "Perhaps, has not yet given up..." "All the information that he has to give." This is not an equitable trade, Sir. What you are saying is... If Powers has given up everything, he knows. Then Moscow would trade? Why would not they? As for Abel, if he dies in an American prison. The next Russian operative who is caught. Might think twice about keeping his mouth shut. You never know. Abel might want to see the sky again. And, decide to trade Russian secrets for small American favors. How can we know this? We are little man. We just do our jobs. Like Lieutenant Powers. He is just a pilot. He was making photographs from 70,000 feet. When he has shot from the sky. People in my country consider this... An act of war. We have to get off this merry-go-round, Sir. The next mistake our countries make... Could be the last one. We need to have the conversation. Our governments cannot. I will ask Moscow. Who knows, what they will say. There are many people, Mr. Donovan. Who does not want this exchange ever takes place. Can you come back tomorrow to discuss their answer? Powers for Abel. And, Frederic Pryor. As I said... Pryor is in the hands of the organs... State Security of the German Democratic Republic. I am confident. You can make arrangements. I am merely a secretary. In the embassy of foreign Powers. Okay. You have to see Mr. Vogel. I will give you his address. There actually is a Mr. Vogel? Why would you imagine otherwise? It is a short cab ride. Please, Mr. Donovan... Wear an overcoat in this weather. I had my stolen from me. What do you expect? It was from Saks Fifth Avenue. Was not it? Mr. Donovan. Mr. Vogel. - Please, come in. - Ok. Sorry about the embassy. The Soviets decided not to host me. That is very irritating. I am still trying to grasp each party is... Status? Yes. And, interest in the proceedings. It is a new world. All are very disorienting. Is not it? Let me tell you what I have to offer. I am a good friend... - "Friend." - No, he is older. "Protege"? Of the attorney general of the German Democratic Republic. Sit down, please. This is unfortunate. Frederic Pryor. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But every accident, properly viewed... Is an opportunity? Is not it, Mr. Donovan? Your country refuses to recognize. The German Democratic Republic. They prefer to make up stories. That the G.D.R does not exist, for instance. Sorry. As a means of forcing your Government's recognition... this real place. Sir. In which you find yourself... The G.D.R. The attorney general is happy to negotiate with you. As a representative of your government. For Mr. Pryor return. Mr. Vogel, I am not here. As a representative of my government. All right! I think that is childish, Mr. Donovan. I have no official status. Fine. You do not represent the USA. I do not represent the G.D.R. My client is Lydia Abel, Rudolf's wife. And, I have... Lydia is the daughter. Helen is the wife. Well... I am prepared to offer... Frederic Pryor in exchange for Rudolf Abel. Then let us be clear. We will produce Rudolf Abel. You will produce, at the same time, the student, Pryor. At the same time? Absolutely. The exchange on offer is a Russian at the end of his life. For an American student at the start of his. Schischkin? He is not a secretary of embassy. Ivan Schischkin is the chief of KGB in western Europe. Whatever he is... He is relaying our proposal to Moscow. And, they will decide. Can I borrow your coat? I lost mine. How did you lose your coat? You know, spy stuff. - I will get you another coat. - Good, because... Who is...? Who is this Vogel? He... We do not know. He might be what you said he is. Friend of the attorney general. Just some guy the G.D.R tapped to handle this. Sounds like the East Germans... are fighting for a place at our table. The G.D.R gets Abel back for the Russians... winning their respect... capturing the headlines for their cause. Which puts the East Germany on the map. We do not care about their map. Stick to the Russians. Stick to the Russians. It is Powers for Abel. What does all mean? This might actually happen. Yeah. That is what you seem to be telling me. We will put Abel on a plane. He will be here Friday. So, if Schischkin gets the okay. All that is the mechanics of the trade. How we swap our guy for their guy. Our "guys." Two people. Powers and Pryor. No. Now do not go bleeding heart on me. Powers is the whole ball game. Forget this Ivy League boy. Obviously it was a good idea. To study Soviet Economics in Berlin. In the middle of the Cold War. Powers is whom we need. You do not even like Powers. Everybody hates Powers. He did not kill himself and he let the commies parade on television. He is the most hated man in America. After Rudolf Abel, maybe. And me. Now wake up! Come out. I have to sleep. I just have to sleep. I told you could sleep. Once we talk what need to talk. You must focus on me. Your government does not care about you. You know that. Any of you. You know that 12 U-2 pilots incurred brain damage. They are vegetables because of altitude, insufficient oxygen. They keep you flying, Gary. You and your friends. They gave you this, a scratchier. Potassium Cyanide. Does that look like they care about you? What is the construction of the destructor unit? What means is this unit working? With what explosives the unit charges. What destruction is it capable? I do not know. They never showed any of the equipment to the pilots. How far can the radar hide? An area on map during flight. I do not know! I do not know! And you were making the flight on April 9? On the industrial area and MIG bomber base. At Baranovichi. I was not. This was my first flight. I need to know about of engine out glide to the ratio. How the plane gets so high. We know it reaches altitude of 70,000 feet. Gary, we know this. I need to know where the planes have flown. Where they have flown, Gary. We must have this talk now. Now. Then you can sleep a little. Sir, wake up. Wake up, Sir. - Sir, can you come with me, please? - Yeah. - We have to move. - Yeah, of course! - Can you come with me, please? - Yeah. Okay. Take your glasses. - What time is it? - It is late but, we need to talk. We need that you get in a plane, okay? Yeah. Upsy-daisy! - Upsy-daisy. - That is right. There we go. Keep moving. Thank you. Other way, other way. There we go. You say a plane. This way, please. Keep moving. So, I received a favorable decision. From Moscow on your proposal. That we help our friends in the German Democratic Republic. By exchanging. Mr. Powers for Mr. Abel. That is well. May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge as a place of exchange? Why not Checkpoint Charlie? We are not looking for publicity. The Glienicke Bridge is very quiet. Especially early in the morning. Glienicke Bridge. I will run to our side. We can have Abel here on Friday. So, Saturday morning. Always impatience, yeah. I want to get home, go into my bed. So, Saturday morning. 5:30 p.m. All right! We have done here. This is a number. In case, anything should come up. All right! Someone will answer at any hour. I do not expect to use it. Shall we toast the arrangement? Why not? Armenian Brandy. - Good for your cold. - Thank you. Would you mind...? This is not part of our business. I would like to ask you a couple of questions. You do not have to answer. I have the answer what I know. I like this guy, your guy. What happens to your guy. When he gets home. We have to make a determination. Whether our guy is now your guy. Now, as I said to you before... He has acted honorably. He is still your guy, believe me. Of course! You will say if it were true. If it were not true. I guess it has come down. Well, forgive me for pushing. But is he in any danger? If the determination is made. Well, goodness. As things are now, everyone is in danger. Cheers. There will be no exchange on Glienicke Bridge. Excuse me, Sir. There will be no exchange. Not for Frederic Pryor. Mr. Vogel, I thought yesterday we have agreed. We agreed on an exchange, Abel for Pryor. Now I learn, you are a rug merchant. Selling the same rug to two customers. - Abel for Pryor you sell to us. - Yeah. Abel for Powers you sell to the Soviets. I am not very sure, the problem is... If the arrangement satisfies two parties, three, or four. What difference does make? The arrangement does not satisfy this part. Now, Mr. Vogel, please... Obviously, you do not know who with you are dealing. The interest of the German Democratic Republic. To deal with... Is it seems dealing with another sovereign power? The United States. An equal power. Instead, you treat us as stooges. For the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Can we just call them the Russians? It will save time. I have an appointment, Sir. I think you are wasting time. Now, tell me if I am describing this wrong. You have a kid, a university student. Someone knows he is not a spy. Who have not threat to you? In exchange for this person. Who is worthless to you? You play an equal part in an exchange. Between the Russians and, the Americans. And this is one transaction between us and the two of you. We are not trying to do two things here, Sir. We are just doing one thing. One, one, one. It is hard for me to see, how the Republic of East German Democrats has been slighted. You agreed with the Soviets without consulting me. Is this a negotiation or a conspiracy? For it to be a conspiracy... There would have to be harm to you, Sir. There are just benefits here. We are of agreeing interests. No. You decide they agree. Where is your appointment, sir? In the West. Good. Look around you. How does the Eastern sector to compare the West? Our Russian friends have decided that... We should not rebuild our capital city. We live in this ruin made by our Russian friends. Go ahead. Make your deal with these Russians. We will not be part of it. There is no deal without Pryor. We are not leaving him here. Is this your position or of your government? Sir, I am here. I am talking to you. You are not a representative of your government. They do not know who you are. Neither do we. You should be careful. This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan. Look, Sir. You must know every respect that matters. I represent my government. You know who I am. Do I know? Do you have the proper papers? Of course not. It does not matter. An American lawyer like you. Can talk your way of anything? Cannot you? You go with him. Sir. - Why? - It is passport problem. What... What is the problem? What is the problem? - You go with him. - Sir. Come with us. And, remember... We control the fate of Frederic Pryor. My God! Yeah. I will start with some coffee, please. Then I will have the Hilton Combo. The American breakfast. And, coffee. Both breakfasts? Yeah, yeah. One first or... Both first, both. When they are ready. And, coffee. You should not be here. Well, sometimes in Germany. You just want a big American breakfast. What happened? Where were you last night? Vogel arranged for me to spend some time in the East. Jesus! Frankly, it is not that much worse. Than where you have me here in the West. The Russians are fine with the exchange. Now Vogel is saying that the East Germans will not do it. We are not going to get Pryor. Great. Good. So, the Soviets are set. We get Powers. We get Powers. Well done! No. The East Germans will not do it. We will not get Pryor, and that kid matters. Every guy matters. Sure. That is why you tried. That is why you tried. Abel is on his way, so we are all set for tomorrow morning. - Wait a minute. - Makes the things simple. We are not getting the kid. Yeah. I understand. We are set. We can ignore the message. We got this morning. What is message? From the East Germans. They called the number. I gave you. They said that wanted to speak to you today. - Vogel called. - No. An Officer of Harold Ott. East German attorney general. What does he want? What does he want? Well, to talk to you. It is ok. I cannot ask you to go back there. Listen, you seem to be ?a persona non grata? to some elements. We will not push our luck. So, he wants to see me. What time? No. No. Now, listen. You... You... You... You do not need to go. In fact you should not go. In fact, you cannot go. We set with the Soviets. We do not want to screw it up. - I am not going to screw it up. - You are not going! Do not be a pain in the ass. I ordered. Enjoy your big American breakfast. I thought it should be negotiated. At the highest level as a courtesy to you. Thank you, Sir. I do not know how things became so confused. Well! I guess sometimes they just do. For sake of clarity. I say, we are fully prepared to exchange. They so called student Pryor, for Rudolf Abel. I understand Mr. Vogel that Pryor is very important to you. Yes, but... We will do a memorandum to that effect. A memorandum. Certainly, we commit a bi-lateral exchange. Yes, yes, sure. I am not sure. What that means but... My country also insists on Francis Gary Powers. No! This is how things became so confused. Powers. What use is he, Sir? You want him back for punitive reasons. What has done has done. He has divulged. What will he divulge? As no doubt, Abel has also. We are offering instead someone, whom you insist is innocent. And, this is right. This is whom you should retrieve. The future. Look to the future. I am sorry. Could you give me a moment, Sir? I am very sorry, Sir. The attorney general regrets. That he had to leave on urgent business. - He left. - Yes. Many apologies. I have been waiting for him over an hour. Very sorry, Sir. Young man? Come here. It is all right! Come here. Take a seat. Come on! Come on! Sit down. Do you like your job here? It is a very good job, Sir. It must be... It must be interesting. Yes, Sir. And, important too. Your English is... Is good. Yes. I hesitate to say it is excellent. It is excellent, Sir. Good, good. Good. I just lost my negotiating partner. And, I need somebody to talk. You seem like a reasonable young man. Can I talk to you? It is all right! It is all right! I just... I just need you to give a message to your boss. It has to be very, very, very clear. Do you understand? Yes, Sir. But perhaps you should wait until him. No, no. The thing is. I have this cold and I want to get home. And, get in bed. Can you give him the message? Certainly. This is the message. There is no deal for Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor. - Do you understand? - Yes, Sir. It arranged for tomorrow morning. It will not happen, unless we get two men. Those two men. - Two, two, two. - Yes. Sir. - Yes. - If there is no deal. Your boss must tell the Soviets. He has to tell the Soviets. They are not getting Rudolf Abel. Yes, Sir. And, tell him this. That so far, Abel has been a good soldier. But he thinks is going home. If we have to tell him it, he is not going home. That the Soviets do not want him. That he is never going home. I imagine his behavior might change. And who will be held responsible for that? That is a long message. Did you get it all? - Yes, Sir. I got it. - Good. You are a good man. Also, tell him... There is no deal, unless we hear... before the end of business today. He has the number. If the exchange is not going to happen. No reason for everybody to get up in the morning. No, Sir. That would be pointless. You are kidding me! You are kidding me! Not really. I need some change. This is exactly what you were not supposed to do. My instructions were to feel out the situation. Your instructions were to get Powers, not Pryor. That was not the original deal. You fouled it up! How do you know? I feel very good about it. You fouled it up! Do not worry. I think it is going to be fine. How do you know? You do not know that. United States. New York, New York. That whole thing... Has me to feel out. Would I swap one for one? Which one? I said: "No. Two for one." They know where we stand. Yeah, what if they think about it and say... Forget it! You keep our guy. We keep your people. Well, then I have fucked it all up. Hey, honey! It is me. Yeah. The fishing has been great. I am in London. Just for one more meeting. Then I am on my way home. Yeah, yeah, I remember that marmalade. It is that shop right by Regent's Park. All right! I will if I have the time. Can I say hi to Roger? Could I say hi to the girls? Is anyone not busy? Have they even noticed I am not around? We are on... Two for one. Hot dog! Let us have a drink. - One "wrinkle". - What is that? They will not release Pryor with Powers not on the bridge. They will release him at the same time. When the Russians give us Powers on the bridge. They will release Pryor over Checkpoint Charlie. What does that mean? I think it means: We want to have the last word. They will do it. You tell me. You felt them out. Where are they? Where is our guy? Where is our guy? They are late. Nobody is late. We are early. - May I? - Yeah. Hoffman? Yeah? I think they have... What? Snipers. I am sure they do. How are you sure they do? Because we have snipers. Step out, Sir. Jim. Dear Jim. How are you? Happy to see you. Had you arranged all this for me? Let us see what that is before, I take credit for it. Any word about Pryor from Checkpoint Charlie? Nothing get yet. Excuse me, Sir. This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy, the United States Air Force... Here to identify Powers. Lieutenant Murphy. Sir. There may be a slight glitch. I was a young man when I left. Whom will they find to identify me? I hope it is not your East German family. I doubt they could identify each other. Looks like our part. Well, let us go. You can stay here, Donovan. Not likely. Open the gate. What do you think will happen, when you get home? I think... I have vodka. Yeah. Yeah. Rudolf, is there not the possibility...? That my people are going to shoot me. Yes. - You are not worried. - Would it help? The answer to your question, my friend. I acted honorably. I think they know that. But sometimes people think wrong. People are people. Let us see how they greet me. What can I look for? If I am embraced or just shown the back seat. Take off the hat. Hey, Powers. Hey, Murphy. Yeah, that is Powers. All right! Mr. Donovan. We go now! Hang on! Believe me, I will tell you. There is no one here. They will release another man at Checkpoint Charlie. We are just confirming that he is there. Now! As per plan if you, please. Let us go. Pryor will show up or, he will not. Let us go. They are waiting to see, If we will do it without him. We just have to stand here. Show them we will not. I do not give a shit what they want. We have our objective. Go ahead, Abel. Go ahead, Sir. You can go. If it is not the plan, we go home. We exchange now, or we go home! - You are waiting for another man. - Yes. You want him, too. I want him. Does not matter what he wants, Sir? I am in charge, and you are free to go. Please go. Walk across. I can wait. It is something. I am not sure yet. Hang on! Let us go. We got him! I...I am... I sent you a gift, Jim. It is a... It is a painting. I hope it has some meaning to you. I am sorry. I did not think to give you a gift. This is your gift. This is your gift. Are you okay? Let us go, let us go, and let us go! Mr. Donovan? Colonel Abel asked me to give this to you. Pardon me, Sir. Were you in charge of this thing, sir? - Yeah. - I have to thank you. I have to thank somebody. I gave them nothing. I gave them nothing. It does not matter. It does not matter what people think. You know what you did. Welcome home! What a trip! Are you okay? Yeah, I am fine. - Did you get the marmalade? - Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. I did. As ordered. Jim? - This is from Arno's. - So? - On the corner! - Well! Honey I was busy. - Please. For God's sake. - We were so busy. - How is Roger? Is he home? - He is home. Carol is home, Peggy is home. Everyone is home. Mom? Come quick! Look! - Mom comes here! - Mom comes here! - Come see this! Look! Watch! - Come on! Francis Gary Powers. Released from prison in the Soviet Union. He turned over to American authorities. Early this morning in Berlin. The President commuted the sentence of Rudolf Abel. Mr. Abel has deported. He has released in Berlin. Efforts to obtain Mr. Powers released. Had underway for some time. In recent efforts. The United States government has had... The cooperation and assistance of Mr. James B. Donovan. A New York attorney. Frederic L. Pryor, an American student, held by East German authorities, since August of 1961. I thought Daddy was fishing. Salmon. Abel now disappeared into the communist world. Powers is answering questions here. And Donovan have gone back to his practice law. Now here is George Finnegan. Speaking for the Douglas Fir Plywood Association. Following his return to Russia, Rudolf Abel was reunited with his wife and daughter. He was never publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union as a Spy. Gary Powers died in a helicopter crash in 1977, while working for KNBC news. He was posthumously awarded the CIA Director's Medal, and the USAF POW Medal in 2000 and the Silver Star in 2012. In 1962, Frederic L. Pryor received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Economics, and Senior Research Scholar at Swarthmore College.
