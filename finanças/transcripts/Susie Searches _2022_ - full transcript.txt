- My goal is to solve the unsolvable. (blows raspberry) Whew. (gentle apprehensive music) Testing, one, two, three. This is "Susie Searches," episode 83. Hi, my name is Susie Wallis and ever since I was a young girl, I've had a very special talent. - The old oak tree visible through the window. - The pool boy did it. - We're only on page 10, Susie. Besides, most mystery writers create red herrings that- - Trust me. (mom chuckles) - Is this even fun anymore? - So much fun. - But you've already figured out that the sheriff double crossed the FBI- - I don't care, it's our tradition. (gentle apprehensive music) It's okay, mom. I can do the reading today. - You sure? - Absolutely. - Wouldn't you rather be out with friends? - The other kids don't like me very much. - Their loss. You're special, Susie. And one day, the whole world is gonna know it. I'm serious. You just need to get your voice out there. (gentle apprehensive music) - For my new listeners, I don't mention this childhood talent for the sake of bragging, but because I want you to know who I am and why I chose to do this show. I wanna solve the unsolvable. I wanna bring resolution to the most haunting mysteries. And I think you'll love what we discuss in today's episode. (fast-paced sanguine music) It's a cold case, August, 1999. It takes place in a town just like our own. A shopkeeper's body was found with two sets of fingerprints on her neck. Both by men who had been dead for over a decade. More soon on "Susie Searches." Once the podcast takes off, and we can monetize from sponsorships, I'm gonna find us a new house. Something with big windows, beautiful views, lots of light. (Susie chuckles) Okay, love you. (gentle spirited music) (gentle spirited music continues) - Hey. Uh, uh, uh, uh, you can't put that there. - What do you mean? Why not? - The red board is for Student Council only. - Oh, you must be new here. Susie. See, I do this every week. So, I mean, unless you wanna spend a long afternoon in front of the Extra-Curricular Committee testifying against why you felt the need to silence the voice of a passionate student, which I wouldn't suggest- - Uh, uh, just leave it. (gentle dreamy music) - Good technique, Susie. Great technique. Excellent disposal protocol. - Thanks. - You know, in a world of swirling chaos, it's important to control what little we can and cleanliness matters. - Yes. - It matters, you know. It's what separates us from the animals. You understand? - Yes. - (chuckles) Good, good. Well, let us return then to our most noble goal, the nurturing of great future minds. - Yeah. (Edgar chuckles) - Wow, you're like the most obsessive person I've ever met. No wonder it's taking you a million years to graduate. - I'm a part-time student, Jillian. We can't afford a live-in nurse. My mother, she's- - I'm kidding, geez. Don't need the back story. I'm just eating a sandwich. (water splashing) (water trickling) (gentle serene music) (gentle serene music continues) (gentle poignant music) (gentle poignant music continues) (gentle spirited music) - Hi. Hello. Hi. How can I help? - I'm kind of busy today. - I know, that's why I asked. - And you know, I'm consuming over 300 grams of protein per day in order to thicken up my posterior delts. - That sounds dangerous. - Why are you smiling? - I don't know, just my natural expression. - Right, this is a serious place of work. You know, we're not flipping burgers. - Oh yes, I would love to learn whatever it is that you're doing. - Well, mostly I'm just cataloging evidence before transferring it to the lab. You know, on TV shows, they get the DNA results back in like 48 hours. But in real life, it can take months. - Hmm. - Is that enough instruction for today? - Mm-hmm. - All right, why don't you get the Sheriff his coffee. - Okay. (gentle spirited music) (door knocking) - Yeah. Over here, hurry. I think I spotted my first sandhill crane. - Hi, I'm- - Shit. It's just a plastic bag. My wife's got me into bird watching. She said with this job, I need some kind of outlet. - Oh, that's nice. - I thought so too. - Yeah. You should try to incorporate something a bit more active. Studies show that police officers who suffer from chronic stress respond well to movement and exercise. - I'm sorry, what's your name again? - Susie Wallis. - Listen, Susie, I'm sure we appreciate all you do around here, but as you can see, I'm buried in work, so. - Hmm, no problem. Two and a half brown sugars and a splash of cream. Just how you like it. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. (phone buzzes) - [Sophie] Sheriff Loggins. - What is it, Sophie? - [Sophie] Pick up your phone, we've got a situation unfolding. - Is it the mayor again? - [Sophie] No, sir. It's about a Wade College student named Jesse Wilcox. Apparently he's been missing for two days. - News of their missing classmate has shaken the students of this intimate college. - The son of a local real estate magnate, Jesse built an immense social media following through his meditation videos. - And I just wanted to read a poem that I've been writing. (ducks quacking) The trees are broken, but Earth is open. I was hopin' we take a moment. (ducks quacking) That's the poem for today guys and- - As we all know, it's been a week since the disappearance of Jesse Wilcox, one of Wade College's most popular students and no one in Ohio seems to have any answers. That's why I've begun working on my own investigation. More soon on "Susie Searches." (dramatic upbeat music) - [Student] Hey, have you heard about Jesse Wilcox? He's been missing for over a week. - [Student] That's crazy, I didn't even know he's missing that long. - Hey, did you hear about Jesse? - Yeah, yeah man, that's really fucked up. - [Student] Have you seen Jesse's meditation videos? - [Student] His ex-girlfriend was heartbroken. - [Student] What kind of a psycho? (students chattering) - In a missing person's case, every day that goes by significantly lowers the success rate of finding them. - Maybe Jesse just went to like, Vegas and didn't tell anyone. - Doesn't fit his behavioral patterns. Plus, he missed his keynote address at the new media conference on Friday. - Hey guys, so before we finish class, President Andrews wanted me to share with you a little more information about your classmate, Jesse Wilcox. He is a communications major and his meditation channel on YouTube has gained a national following. I'll show you. - Oh, didn't see you there. What's up, guys? I feel something in my head. Oh yeah, this is my Be Kind beanie. That's the thing about meditation that I love the most. There are times where I will just meditate for hours and hours and hours and hours and like, I won't even fall asleep once. My mom's like, dinner's ready. I'm like, dinner? Like, I started in the morning. 'Cause there's just too much hate, there's just too much hate. Like, on our phones, on Instagram, on TikTok and like, when the world has a lot of hate, it's time to meditate and I've been saying that for, I don't even know, years. I like to pick a note, mine's C. (Jesse humming) Nah, just play it. I feel better, do you? Remember, love yourself, laugh a lot, live your life. Don't get down, be kind. - And again, that is your classmate, Jesse Wilcox. And if anyone has any clues to his disappearance, they're encouraged to call the Taskforce Hotline. Thank you. (Susie munching) - [Reporter] You may be familiar with the Wilcox name. Lawrence Wilcox recently made headlines after his third charge of disorderly conduct. - [Reporter] In other local news, Selma Peterson's prized Shetland Sheepdog, Whiskers (door banging) Was taken from his yard. - Lunch break is only 20 minutes, I told you. - [Reporter] Two weeks involving the disappearance of a local pet. - It's so sad. He totally ate here like, every day. I've never seen anyone like those gross vegan burgers as much as he did. - Have any reporters contacted you? - Yeah, some for interviews, but I'm holding out for national news. - Yeah? - Absolutely. My cousin works at Dateline in New York. Said there's a huge chance this story will explode. - [Friend] You think he's dead? - [Jillian] 100%. - [Friend] That's so dark. - I know. - [Friend] Anyway, are you coming to- - Did you guys hear about Jesse's uncle? Lawrence Wilcox used to be the Vice Chairman of the family real estate company up until like a year ago. He's not even listed on any of the boards. Jesse's dad must have- - Wow, you're such a little stalker. - I'm gonna be famous one day, Jillian, when I solve this case and become a big hero. - Okay, awesome. That will rock, I can't wait. (dramatic upbeat music) - As I investigate Jesse's uncle, clearly the black sheep of the Wilcox family, the first thing I try to figure out is, who is he really? I mean, what makes him tick? - Well, that's, I tell people this all the time, you have to accept that the market is like this living, breathing entity. - [Susie] If that leads nowhere, does he have any secrets? What about any abnormal behavior? What could he be hiding? Exhaust that road. I mean, leave no stone unturned. The internet is vast, you're bound to find something if you just look hard enough. (dramatic upbeat music) (alarm beeping) (fast-paced sanguine music) (notification dings) - Grab hands, grab virtual hands and try and connect to the parts of ourselves that are peaceful. - [Reporter] Countless interviews have been conducted in the investigation into the disappearance of Wade College student, Jesse Wilcox, according to the special agent in charge. - Love yourself, laugh a lot. Live your life, be kind, don't forget. - [Susie] But let's stay focused. One thing that caught my attention is the fact that Lawrence, along with Jesse's father, Roy, is a real estate magnate. He has a bunch of different properties, all with different names. A little odd if you ask me. But one in particular stood out. Starboard Inc. And I can't wait to share what I learned with the Sheriff's department. - Right? Okay. Yep, I'm on it. - [Susie] How can I help? - By bugging someone else. - But I actually think I might have a pretty good lead. - Really? Then go tell the Sheriff. - Okay. - I'm kidding, Susie, don't bother him. (gentle suspensive music) - Why do I think the culprit is Jesse's uncle, Lawrence Wilcox? Well, let me count the ways. First of all, Lawrence is known for his erratic behavior. Behavior so unreliable that Jesse's dad had to sever all business ties, thus giving Lawrence a motive to get back at him and what would scare his brother most of all? Taking his most prized possession, his only child. Secondly, Lawrence has been charged with disorderly conduct on multiple occasions. I mean, for someone with his temperament, kidnapping Jesse wouldn't be so far-fetched. And lastly, Lawrence has over a dozen unlisted properties all over the township that no one has looked into. I know this because I work at the Sheriff's department. And no one there listened to me. (upbeat menacing music) (upbeat menacing music continues) (upbeat menacing music continues) (car engine revving) I have now reached the third property owned by Starboard Inc., one of Lawrence Wilcox's many LLCs. The site appears to be deserted, but I will proceed with caution. (rain pattering) (footsteps plodding) Again, I will do nothing to put myself in danger. I'm not breaking in. I'm simply collecting information. Wish me luck. (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (rain pattering) (door rattling) (door squeaking) (gentle ominous music) (gentle menacing music) Haven't found anything yet. (gentle menacing music) But it's possible... I'm just not looking in the right place. (door squeaking) (gentle ominous music) (footsteps thumping) (gentle ominous music) Update, I have descended below the house. Obviously, I can't know for sure, but I see the faint outline of footsteps. (gentle menacing music) (footsteps plodding) (gentle ominous music) (footsteps plodding) (gentle ominous music) (Susie shrieks) (Jesse groaning) (tense dramatic music) (Susie choking) (tense dramatic music) (Susie choking) - I'm Susie. Susie, Susie Wallis. It's okay. (Jesse sobbing) Ssh, it's okay. It's okay. (Jesse sobbing) (gentle spirited music) (people chattering) (camera shutter clicking) (gentle classical music) (camera shutter clicking) (gentle classical music) (gentle classical music continues) (crowd cheering) (gentle classical music) - [Reporter] And in one of the year's most remarkable stories, it appears that a local college student has rescued her kidnapped classmate. The details are still pouring in. We fully expect this to be an ongoing store. - I can confirm that at 1:34 AM last night, we received a phone call from a farmhouse in Ridley. It was at that location that we discovered Jesse Wilcox. He appeared in a state of shock, but without injury. That's all we are prepared to say at this point. - Whoa, whoa, what about the student that found him first? - Well, all credit where credit's due. We wouldn't have been able to do any of this without our department intern, who I'm reluctant to name, given that the suspect is still at large, but she knows who she is. - Multiple news outlets have already reported her name is Susie Wallis. - I cannot confirm or deny that, but I would like to reiterate that we are- - Mom! - Numerous leads and this department will not rest until we bring him to justice. - Why don't you ask the girl for help? (reporters laughing) - Isn't it amazing? (upbeat joyous music) (class cheering) (class applauding) ♪ I'm not wearing my usual lipstick ♪ ♪ I thought maybe we would kiss tonight ♪ - I just wanna take a moment to thank all of my new listeners for the outpouring of support. I promise every one of you that I'll be working just as hard on my future cases. This is only the beginning. More soon on "Susie Searches." (upbeat joyous music) (car engine roaring) (gentle apprehensive music) (car engine revving) (gentle apprehensive music) (gentle apprehensive music continues) (gentle apprehensive music continues) (upbeat apprehensive music) (upbeat apprehensive music continues) (upbeat apprehensive music continues) (door clanking) (gentle apprehensive music) (keys jingling) (boxes clattering) (gentle cryptic music) (gentle ominous music) (gentle cryptic music) (gentle enigmatic music) (gentle enigmatic music continues) (tense dramatic music) (flames roaring) (flames roaring) (birds chirping) - So, do you wanna get together this weekend for the new report? - I'll have to check my schedule. - Yeah, of course. - They're running a six-part series about the Lindbergh Kidnappings and it's one of my all-time favorites, even though he was a literal Nazi. - Hi there, I was just contacted by President Andrews. They need you right away in Casper Hall. - Can it wait? I'm not gonna lie, I'm really looking forward to mixing tritants and analytes. - Ah, they said it was urgent. (gentle suspenseful music) - There she is. Aw. (people applauding) - What's going on? - Okay, so sorry to spring this on you (chuckles) but KWST local news called, they had a quick opening and they wanted to chat with our famous students. - (chuckles) That's good. - Great, so why don't you just take a seat next to Jesse there. (gentle mysterious music) - Hey. - Hey. - Listen, Susie, I just- - No, you... You really don't have to. - No, listen. I owe my life to you, okay. (Susie chuckles) And you just rock, you know. (gentle mysterious music) - What a story. (laughs) I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with you, Jesse. I can't be the only person who's fallen in love with you from your videos. - Oh, stop. - [Interviewer] How are you doing? - I'm good. I'm real good. - Fantastic. Susie, tell us everything from your perspective. - Um... You know, I found out on the news, like everyone else did. - Well, that's amazing. (chuckles) - And he just seemed like a really good kid and I was tired of nothing happening. - Susie is captain humble and... 'Cause you know, I remember learning about heroes in school, like like, Mesopotamia, Romans, like the kids in "Hunger Games." - Oh, I love "Hunger Games," are you kidding? - But I never thought I'd be sitting next to one. And I am. - Wow. I just got chills. Did you get chills? I just got chills. Good, I think that's good. - That's it. - Fantastic job you two. Oh my God, wow. - Okay, really? (chuckles) That was fun, I think. - Yeah. I liked it. - Oh, thank you. What are you doing tomorrow night? Do you wanna have dinner? - Yes. - Yeah, they make this mean vegan burger... You're good? They make this amazing vegan burger at this place, House Haven, you know House Haven? It's amazing, so great. - Cool. - Yeah, let's go. - I'll see you there. - Okay. Bye Susie. - Oh. - Cool, do you want my, you want the thing? - Celebrity alert, celebrity alert, celebrity alert. (chuckles) Oh, man, it's our own resident Sherlock Holmes. I saw you, my lady, on the news today. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah, yeah. No, thank you. I mean, you've done this humble snack bar a huge honor, Ms. Wallis, so for that I salute you. - I was just doing my civic duty. - Civic duty, you're darn right because it's our responsibility to clean up society's trash, both literally and metaphorically. (Edgar chuckles) - The guy is a real weirdo. (Susie chuckles) Don't worry, you still take the cake though. (upbeat amorous music) (upbeat amorous music) ♪ Home to you ♪ ♪ Is a neighborhood in the night kitchen ♪ ♪ Home to you ♪ (people laughing) - Hey. - Susie! Everyone, this is Susie. - Hey. - I mean, duh, not that you need an introduction. Come sit. I think you're gonna love this place, it's amazing. And everybody's so nice here. Like, they came over and just gave us everything for free. - Yeah, I think they're so nice because you're kind of a celebrity now. - No way. - Yes, way. You're a celebrity, dude. (friends laughing) - What do you think Susie? Are we celebrities? You and me? - I don't know. (Jesse and Ray laughing) - It's so awesome that you came 'cause I'm sure you're like so busy. - Yep. - Yeah, you're like a genuine hero. (Susie laughs) - Ray's your biggest fan. - It's so embarrassing. - He's your biggest fan, big Susie posters, he made t-shirts, everything. - Oh, he's right though. I've read probably every article about you. And I just, I have so many questions. - Look, she probably just wants to relax though. - Yeah, right. - Well, what do you wanna know? - Well, I guess I'm just like still curious how you found him. - Um, well, I learned in the county registrar that Lawrence had three foreclosed properties and they were all located in the same area- - Wait, also that, why do you use the same exact wording in every interview I've heard? (gentle cryptic music) - Chill out. Why are you grilling her? Susie, I think Ray is very jealous he didn't solve it himself. - I don't know, maybe I'm just anxious in general 'cause you know, your uncle is still out there. What if he comes back? - Well, he's not a bad guy. I think he just has anger issues and you know, he pulled a prank that he took a little far. - [Ray] What do you think, Susie? I mean, you're the expert. (Jesse tapping) (Jesse groaning) - Hey Jesse. (Jesse groaning) Hey, look, I know that this is really tough for you. I do, but it'll all be over soon. (Jesse groaning) - [Ray] Whoa, you okay? (gentle mysterious music) - I am... I have to go. - Oh no, are you sure? - I have French history tomorrow and it's just, it's a lot, yeah. - Okay, I'll walk you to your car. - It was really nice to meet you guys. - What's your problem? - This is really nice, but you didn't have to. - Oh, yes I did, you needed protection. - I carry pepper spray and a butterfly knife. - You do? - Yeah. - Of course you do. Well, you should 'cause there's people getting kidnapped out here, so. (Susie chuckles) Hey Susie, wait. Can I tell you something? - Yeah, of course. - I think about you every hour. I wouldn't be here without you. I wouldn't be walking around and I wouldn't be breathing the air and looking at the sky and I mean... Thank you, thank you. You get the idea, sorry. - It was a fluke thing. - No it wasn't. BS, I've listened to every single one of your podcast episodes. Every single one. - Really? - It blows my mind actually. But I wanted to ask you, like, why are you so obsessed with true crime? - Um, well, growing up, my happiest memories were of my mom reading to me and they were always detective novels. But the thing was, I could always guess the real culprit like, every single time. (laughs) She said that I had a gift and that I should be famous. - She's right. - (laughs) I mean, ever since she was diagnosed with MS, I told myself that I would prove her right. Yeah, I'm not really sure she even knows what's going on anymore. - You know what, I'm sure she does. - Anyways, I love your videos. - Stop. - No, really, my mom always said kindness is the most valuable currency. - So true. - Yeah, sometimes she would shout, be kind, when she would drop me - She would? - Off at school. - That's incredible. - Yeah. - She stole my line. - Yeah. Jesse, you just have this thing where you communicate with people so naturally. There was this FBI agent in the 1930s, Charles Winstead, and he had the same thing and he was kind of a legend in his department. He was very well respected. - That's so cool. You see, like who's Charles Winstead? That's so cool, you're so smart. - But I just told you. (Jesse and Susie laughs) - Since your story broke, applications are up 300%. (chuckles) Local awareness is at an all-time high and alumni donations have doubled. - That's cool. - I mean, who would've thought that this true crime stuff was so big with your generation. (sighs) But this, this could really change things. Are you ready for some more big news? - Sure, yeah. - We have been contacted by a national morning show (laughs) They wanna interview you this weekend. - I mean, do... Do we think that's like a little much? (gentle mysterious music) - Jesse, you've just suffered a terrible ordeal. Am I right? If Susie's heroism could inspire even one person to make a difference, hmm, hmm, isn't that worth it? - Yeah, of course. - Yes, of course. So the studio's located in Cincinnati, of course, they'll cover all your travel and hotel expenses. Just make sure to mention that Wade College is currently ranking number 12 for pre-med in Ohio. So Susie, what do you think? - Oh, I'm... I'm so happy. - Ah, that is terrific. (Susie chuckles) - Jillian, why do you think I'm talking to you? - I don't know. - Well, because I found several wild berry flavored water bottles on the top shelf. - Yeah. - Of the storage cabinet. - Exactly, right next to the other water bottles. - No, no. Okay, flavored water is on the shelf below except for lemon. - You're insane. - No, I'm not, I just have a system. - Okay, well maybe you just need to loosen up. (Edgar banging table) - Disorder means chaos. If everybody does what you do, the fucking world is gonna fall apart. Just do what I'm saying. - Susie. Did you see that shit? - What? - Edgar, he practically assaulted me and this isn't like the first time either. The other day- (Sheriff clears throat) - Can we chat? - Uh, I guess. - I'm talking to Susie, I don't know who you are. - Oh. Yeah, fine whatever but this definitely counts as your lunch break. - It's embarrassing. - What is? - The reason I called you here. I wanna talk to you about Jesse's uncle. - Lawrence. - I know his name. No one can find him. I mean, the state has officials looking into it, but I wanna prove myself. - I'm sure you'll find him. - I appreciate everything you've done, you know, but it's only a matter of time before people start pointing fingers, wondering why I haven't been more effective. - Of course I'll help. - Thank God. (chuckles) Can I tell you something? - Sure. - But I don't want you to take it the wrong way. - Okay. - There's this kind of bird native to New Zealand, the Kea. It's the most curious in the world, super smart too. Some say it outscores even apes in intelligence exams. But it's mischievous, always causing trouble. - What are you saying? Are you calling me a Kea? - (chuckles) I don't know. Probably just reading too many bird books. (gentle cryptic music) (telephone ringing) - Bet you think you're big shit now. - No, not really. - Sheriff says I should be more accommodating, so I'm adding you to the internal mail server. - Amazing. - Don't get too excited, it doesn't have anything confidential, but at least you'll be up to date. I'll also start handing off more responsibilities. - Like organizing evidence? - I'm not a fucking idiot, but I'll teach you more about it. - I would love that. (watch beeps) - Oh, time to build some boulder shoulders. (liquid sloshing) (telephone ringing) Ah, get outta my chair. (car engine revving) (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (gentle suspensive music) (gentle suspensive music continues) - Ray. - Oh, Susie. - Hey, why are you following me? - Um... - That's not an answer. - Jesse, he gave me shit for not being nice enough to you. - Oh, that's sweet. - Yeah, well, he's a sweetheart. Just don't fuck with him. - I don't understand. - Look, I know he seems super vanilla, right? Mr. Be Kind. But he's a lot more complicated than that. And he only needs people in his life right now that he can trust. - He can trust me. - Okay. It's good to see you.

You know, these interviews, they sometimes lead to even bigger shows reaching out. - Honestly, I'm fine with just like- - And I mean, like "After Hours with Hayden Powers" big. I read once that if Hayden Powers mentions your book just once on their show, it instantly becomes a Best Seller, like that. So just think about us. - You mean, like all the good we could do? - Exactly. - Yeah.

(laughs) - That makeup artist is a genius, I love what she did. - Thanks. - Oh my God. It's so nice to eat again. - What do you mean? - Um...

It's not very warm, but it should still be good. - Somebody help me! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Help me! - Hey, hey, hey, we're too far away, no one can hear you. I don't want you to stress yourself out. (Jesse groans) Hey, relax. (Jesse sobbing) No one is gonna hurt you. I need you to start eating, okay. You just hang in there. Everything's going to be okay.

(gentle mysterious music) - What's wrong? - What? - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm good, I'm fine. So what should we do tonight? - I don't know, what do you wanna do? - What do you wanna do? - (chuckles) I don't... - You know what we could do, is we could go, just try and find a movie, like movie theater around here. (phone beeps) - Yeah, that's cool. - Oh, you know what we could do? We could sneak up to the roof and just lay down and look at the stars. - I would love that. - Dad, the interview went so well and like, you couldn't see my pimples at all on the left side. The makeup lady had this great... What? No. Oh shit. (gentle somber music) Holy shit. Wait, slow down. Um... Okay, yeah, I'll call you back. Yeah, I'll call you back. - What is it? - Oh my God, check the news. (gentle somber music) Do you know what this means? This means my uncle wasn't the kidnapper. - It's an early report. - No, he's been in Peru for the last six months. - We should wait for more information. - I gotta go, I have to go. I owe him an apology. (car engine roaring) (phone notification dinging) Hey, I'm really sorry.

Did you speak to your uncle? - [Jesse] No, not yet. He's kind of freaked out by all the media attention. - Yeah. - [Jesse] Honestly, I feel pretty bad for him right now. Anyway, this sounds weird but have you heard from Ray? - No. Why would I? - [Jesse] Well, he's not answering his phone and I don't know, we were supposed to meet up this morning, so. - I wouldn't worry, I'm sure he's fine. (upbeat band music) - Just as our campus has been celebrating the return of Jesse Wilcox, a new tragedy has struck. Police have identified a body at the bottom of Suicide Gulch, Ray Garcia, a senior history major and immigration advocate here on campus. (Jesse sobbing) (church gong resounding) - I'm gonna pass out. - It's okay. - This can't be real. - Ssh. - I can't go in. - Yes, you can, you can do it, you're just in shock. (somber organ music) I can give you some alone time with him, if you want. - No, let's go together. I need you with me. (somber organ music) I mean, he was just here a few days ago. - He'll always be with us. - I just don't get it. I don't get it. It just doesn't make sense, I don't get it. (somber organ music) - Susie. (chuckles) I'm so glad you could come. Thank you. - Yeah, of course. I wouldn't- - Such a shame what happened to Ray. It certainly doesn't help our diversity initiative. - Yeah. - Yeah. By the way, favor to ask you, if you don't mind. When you leave the funeral parlor, would you mind going out the main entrance? There are some reporters outside. I thought it would be a good idea if they all saw our star student. - Yeah, okay. - That's terrific. (camera shutter clicking) (reporters chattering) - Susie! (reporters chattering) Is anyone watching us? - No, I don't think so. - Susie. The more I think about Ray, the more frightened I get. - Jesse, it was a suicide. I know that's, it's horrible but these things happen. - I don't think it was. Actually, I know it wasn't. - You know, they say that you can't truly know another person. - I knew Ray. I knew Ray better than anyone else in the universe. He... He was my boyfriend. (gentle apprehensive music) - What? (gentle apprehensive music) Um... But no one... No one knew or? - Yeah, we didn't tell anyone, of course not. His parents are super religious, have you met them? - Yeah but that doesn't mean that he wouldn't commit suicide. - Literally this weekend, we were gonna go to Big Mountain and celebrate our one-year anniversary. We had like a whole thing planned and he planned it. He made the arrangements, he planned our meals. Why would he do all that? What if the guy who was behind my kidnapping is somehow responsible for this? I mean, like I don't know if he was just some like fucking psycho or something, but he definitely knew what he was doing. He did. And I just know with your gift, you can help me find him. - The police are investigating. - Well, the police didn't find me. You found me. You saved my life. Please, Susie. - I'm flattered that you would believe in me, but I worry that I'm too close to the case. (gentle apprehensive music) - That's okay. - I'm sorry. (rain pattering) (gentle serene music) I really liked him. And I thought he liked me too. But I guess it was all a lie. Feels like yesterday, I was getting everything I ever wanted and now I'm losing it all. (gentle serene music) But I'm still doing great, so don't go worrying about me. I really wish you could give me advice right now. - In these dark times, I've started doubting everything, everything I've ever believed in, except you. Susie, you have to help me find who's responsible for this. Try to sink into your happy place. Deep breath. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hi, it's Susie Wallis. I.. Sorry, I'm calling you so late. - That's okay. I didn't know you had my phone number. Anyway, I'm still at the office. My wife's gone on business, so I'm just burning the midnight oil. - Oh. - I'm also watching Jesse's meditation videos. They're not that bad. - [Susie] Yeah, that's good to hear. - I gotta be honest, we moved to Wade to escape the stress. You know, big city life wasn't for me. Anyway, now... - Do you think that Ray Garcia really killed himself? - Why wouldn't I? - You don't have any suspects or anything? - Should I? - No, I mean, I don't know. I'm just trying to learn more about suicide and depression. - This should serve as a reminder, you know, when you're feeling down, don't stay down. In the words of Jesse, be positive, homie. - Thanks. (gentle menacing music) Yes, loyal listeners, this is a call to arms. I want your best theories, your most random, your most absurd and in the upcoming weeks, we'll be delving into some on this podcast. If Lawrence isn't the kidnapper, then I wanna know who is. (fast-paced sanguine music) (fast-paced sanguine music drops off) (gentle enigmatic music) (phone notification dings) (gentle eerie music) (Susie gasps) - I am so sorry, I did not mean to startle you. - Is everything okay? - Oh yeah, of course. I just wanted to formally say hello since we've never seen each other outside the office. - You following me? - Yes. Yes, I am. But oh, don't worry, no, no, no. It's nothing bad on your part, Susie. No, we're just trying to protect you in case the kidnapper shows up again, yeah. I mean, to be honest, you're kind of the first person he'd go after. - If he does, he better watch out. - Hmm, yeah, yeah. Well, you enjoy your day. (phone notification dings) (gentle eerie music) - Hey Susie. So Terriers and Pomeranians have been going missing on this street for months. (people chattering) Spooky. - Someone keeps taking a huge dump in my private bathroom. Now I'm not saying it's a mystery kidnapper, but it could be. - So I don't have like a tip necessarily, but I've just been like lonely. Like, are we alone? Because like aliens, you know. (gentle suspensive music) (gentle suspensive music continues) (tense piano music) - Two days ago, I saw the Monahan boys steal $5 out of the tithing dish. - I noticed the owner of the crazy house was digging a super deep hole in his side yard. - I've had this really strange and bizarre feeling about my neighbor, Edgar Cabot. Last week, I saw him try to hit a raccoon with his car. - According to former Police Chief, Jefferson Gray of Cleveland, Ohio, it doesn't matter if you have five suspects or 500. More often than you think, the culprit is right under your nose. (tense dramatic music) (gentle ominous music) (gentle ominous music continues) (Edgar humming) Jillian, we need to talk. - Okay. Oh my God, are you wearing makeup? - Um... - It looks really good, I swear. - We need to discuss Edgar. - Ugh, finally. - You said that he's like a- - Psycho, yeah, for sure. - Right, but there's you know, a lot of odd people in the world. - Yeah, this is different than that. So, my stepsister went to school with him like a million years ago and she said that Edgar attacked another student and then the board like hushed it up 'cause apparently, his dad is like loaded. - If he's so rich, why does he work at the snack bar? - I don't know. You're the detective. (gentle suspensive music) - Psychopathic behavior usually presents itself at an early age. Antisocial tendencies, reoccurring problems with the law and cruelty to animals are all early warning signs. (gentle menacing music) (camera shutter clicking) (upbeat menacing music) (upbeat menacing music continues) (phone vibrates) (gentle menacing music) Hey. Everything okay? - Yes. - So I think I found a potential lead- - Susie, I'm not gonna lie. For the past week, I haven't been able to meditate, like at all. I've tried, get on my app and I close my eyes and try and unplug but all I can see is death. Bodies and limbs and stuff like that. But then this morning, I woke up and I have no idea why but I had this newfound clarity. I just felt more present and more centered than I ever have in my whole life, ever. And as if on cue, hello universe, it listened to me. I just got an email. They found more DNA evidence from deeper inside the basement. Apparently there are two entrances. - Really? - Yes, it's just like your podcast said, you can be the best criminal in the world, but you cannot outrun science. (gentle foreboding music) They found more DNA evidence. DNA evidence, DNA evidence. (gentle foreboding music) You okay? - Yeah. - I just can't wait for this to all be over. (tense brooding music) - There's a lot of debate about behavioral signs of guilt, whether a criminal will turn insomniac or sleep like a baby, whether they'll develop facial ticks, constantly touch their hair or adopt new body postures. Even shoulder shrugging can be a sign of guilt. But at the end of the day, none of that really matters to police. What matters is cold, hard evidence. Facts that tie the suspect to the murder scene. Stick to a routine. Just stick to a routine. Just stick to a routine. Just stick to a routine. Just stick to a routine. Just stick to a routine. - [Lecturer] Morning. - Morning. - [Lecturer] Looking forward to that report, Susie. - What report? - The one on oxidation-reduction reaction. No, don't tell me that your fame is getting in the way of your studying. - Oh my God. - Oh, don't worry, get it to me later. - No, this is unacceptable, I should face the consequences. - [Lecturer] You know what I love about you, Susie? - No, I don't. - What you see is what you get. With everybody else in the world, well, everyone I know, they wear masks. Not with you. Never change, okay? - Okay. (gentle spirited music) Hello listeners. It's no secret, I've been a bit stuck on this case, but don't worry, I won't give up. I'll never change who I am. Life takes unexpected twists, even the most perfect plans don't always work out, but never lose faith. Every obstacle is really just an opportunity to dig deeper. Eventually, a solution will present itself. It always does. More soon on "Susie Searches." - I'm gonna need to leave early today, so can you cover for me? - Hmm. - I said, I'm gonna need to leave early today. So can you cover for me? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, it's a date. No, I'm not gonna answer any questions, okay. You know, Susie, I was wrong about you. Even though you saved the day, you still have no social life. Okay, I think I'm gonna go and change, I feel weird about this shirt. - I like it. - You do? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, yeah I'm definitely gonna change. Bye. (powder hissing) (blender whirring) (gentle menacing music) - You said there was an emergency. - Um, yeah, someone broke into the back cabinets. - Why was the storage closet left open? - I... I don't know. - Well, ah, ah, ah, ah, I know the rules, I know the rules. You don't know the rules. What are you, some kind of an idiot? (upbeat mysterious music) Well, I guess they didn't take anything. (gentle mysterious music) (gentle mysterious music continues) - Hi. - Thought you were off duty tonight. - Oh, I am. Bonanza Burger makes these delicious chocolate protein shakes, my mom loves them. They've helped her put on some weight. - Really? - Yeah, and I remembered, you said you were trying to put on mass too. So I thought I'd bring you one on my way home. - So, is she seeing any gains? - Yes, big gains. - Do you know if it is an isolate or concentrate or? - Oh, I don't really know the terms, but they did say to drink it slowly or it could give you indigestion. - (chuckles) One time in college, I ate six cheese logs and chased it with warm beer. (Deputy gulping) Ah. It's not a problem. - Okay, well have a good night. - Mm-hmm. (gentle mysterious music) (stomach squelching) (stomach rumbling) (stomach rumbling) Hmm. Oh. (stomach growling and rumbling) (flatulence blowing) Ah. Oh. (Deputy groaning) (stomach rumbling) (flatulence blowing) (upbeat sanguine music) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (gentle menacing music) (gentle menacing music continues) - Just one last thing. Just one last thing. Just one last thing. - Boo. (Susie shrieks) It's me. - Hi. - It's me. - What's up? - Hey. - What's up? I've been looking for you. - Oh, I'm just, I'm headed home. - Okay. - Yeah. - Do you wanna grab a bite or can you? - God, you know I would, but I... There's this- - Oh, you don't have to if you're busy, you got something going on. (feet pattering) There's a lot of fakes in world, Susie. I should know, I'm one of them. You know, I don't even know that much about meditation. Like, I mean, I try to do it, but it doesn't really help. Like honestly, I'm probably the most anxious person you've ever met. Seriously. - That's normal. - Yeah but I obsessively check my YouTube subscribers and my IG and my TikTok, everything like, and if any of those numbers goes down, I get so sad. Not just normal sad, I get like... I get so sad, I'll just start punching the walls until my knuckles start bleeding. - Why are you telling me this? - Because you would've figured it out anyway. You know, maybe when they get this guy in custody, you can teach me how to be more like you. (gentle somber music) (gentle somber music continues) - This is Susie Wallis with a late breaking report. After weeks of fruitlessly searching for Jesse's kidnapper, I think I finally have a solid lead. Edgar Cabot, the son of Wade College mega donor Frank Cabot. Yes, in case you're wondering, that is the same Cabot of Cabot Dining Hall but I'll get into the specifics of that later. Right now, I'm off to investigate. But if something happens to me, I will be leaving my recorder in my car as proof. (car door slams) (gentle menacing music) (foliage rustling) (gentle menacing music) (footsteps plodding) (keys jingling) (gentle menacing music) (doorknob rattles) (door creaks) (footsteps plodding) (gentle menacing music) (torch thuds) (footsteps plodding) (drawer clattering) (drawer clattering) (metal clanking) (Susie breathes heavy) Oh my God. (gentle suspensive music) (dogs barking in background) (gentle suspensive music) (gentle suspensive music continues) (chains rattling) (gentle suspensive music) (gentle eerie music) (tense sinister music) - Hi, Susie. - I think I'm in the wrong house. (Edgar laughs) - Yeah, come on, we both know that you're smarter than that. - No really, it's a mistake. I can just leave and not mention... - What? My practice? Are you kidding? Honestly, I'm just glad that somebody's gonna get to see my work. You know, these pets can only spread disorder and chaos. Not to mention, disease. - I called your psychiatric hospital. - What? - They said, your dad pulled you out before you were healthy. - Oh. - He said, you just needed a steady day job. - Oh, well dad was right. - No, you're not well. - You are a pest. You are a pest, Susie and pests make the world unclean. Pests make the world unclean. Unclean! (Susie groans) Whoopsie. (tense dramatic music) Hey, where are you going? (Susie groaning) Oh. (chuckles) This is kind of fun. (Susie groans) (tense dramatic music) Susie, where are you going? (tense dramatic music) (blade chinks) (Susie groans) (tense sinister music) (heartbeat thumping) (door slams) Susie. You got blood on my machete. Open up. Susie, it's locked. - [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? - Hello? Hi, can you track- - Susie, the door's locked. - Track this phone. I'm being attacked - Susie. - By Edgar Cabot. I need a rescue team- (door pounding) Fuck. - Susie, open this door. - [Operator] Please hang up and try your call again. (door pounding) - Don't worry about it, I'll make it quick, all right. (door pounding) (gentle ethereal music) (door pounding) (tense dramatic music) I got it open. No thanks to you. (gentle menacing music) - Please. Please, I'm sorry. (blade chinks) (tense dramatic music) (gunshot bangs) (Susie breathes heavily) (police siren blaring) (police radio chattering) - Gordon, give me a sec. There you go. This oughta cheer you up a little. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I mean, for everything. - You were my prime suspect, you know. Had my guys following you for weeks. Never been so happy to be proven wrong. To the Kea. (gentle apprehensive music) (audience cheering) - [Announcer] This must be the story of the year. Wow, that's all I can say. - I'll second that, I've never heard anything like this before. So not only did you save your classmate, you then went out and caught the real kidnapper as proven by a DNA link. (audience cheering) - You're too kind. - But on a more sober note, I really can't imagine what you must have gone through at Edgar Cabot's house. I mean, were you ever frightened? - Yes, but I needed to know the truth. - Hmm, spoken like a true detective. - She is truly, she's unique, right? (audience cheering) - That's right, give it up for them. Okay, take me through that horrific night unless it's too traumatic. - No, no, of course not. Well, if it weren't for the brave actions of Sheriff Loggins, I probably would've died in that basement. - Oof. Okay, so there you are, you're trapped in the basement with a crazed killer breaking down the door. - Yeah, I guess it sounds like a horror movie. - It is a horror movie and I mean, this is a bad guy. This is an individual with a history of violence towards animals and sociopathic tendencies. How'd you get through it? - Well... I remembered something my mother always said, if ever you're anxious, just take three deep breaths and imagine an ocean breeze. (audience cheering) (gentle apprehensive music) - Wait, what did you just say? - I said, if ever you're anxious, just take three deep breaths and imagine an ocean breeze. (gentle apprehensive music) (gentle apprehensive music) (water splashing) (gentle apprehensive music) (upbeat sanguine music) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (upbeat sanguine music continues) (gentle spirited music) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues) (gentle spirited music continues)
