Jesus says, "John, I can see your house from here." It's so early. Hey, this was your idea. Give me your key. You don't have yours? Uh-uh. Here, I got it. James, that's the most obvious place in the world to put it. Luckily, we've got nothing worth stealing, lazy legs. Let's do it. Don't run so fast. You're like my high school gym teacher. What's going on? What are you doing? Why did you set the alarm? I didn't set it. But... I don't want to go running. I didn't set it, Amy. Well, the bogey man must have set it. Morning, Deaks.

Wasn't this car door locked? Yes, okay. So all I know is that I didn't make it. I didn't make it either, Amy. So who made it? Isn't it weird to you at all? Yes. I don't know, maybe. You forget things sometimes. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. I'm just saying that you forget things sometimes. What? Like when I drink? James, all I'm saying is that I bet all of this music is right on your computer. No, no, no. Wait! What's that? "The Doo Ron Ron Mix." Aren't those the same songs? What? See? I told you. What is this, your idea of a joke? What, you think that I put those on there? I know I sure as hell didn't. James, you have eight thousand songs on your computer. You probably just forgot. You think that I have nothing better to do than to come into your office and sneak around and make a mixed CD? Honestly, I don't know what it is you do here all day, Amy? You've been working on this Afghan embroidery thesis for seven years. Or is it eight? You're an asshole. Relax, I was joking. No, you're not. Hey, come on. Help me figure this out. Nasty little shit. Amy, please! Amy. Hey. Come on, Amy. Is that you? Amy! Hey, you home? Amy! Katherine, it's James. Yeah, what's up? Is Amy there with you? No. Why would she be here? Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure. Did she say she was going away at all? No. She didn't? No. I got this note from her saying that she needed to clear her head. Why? She didn't say. Did you guys have a fight or something? No, we didn't have a fight. Is she mad at you? Not that I know of. "Not that you know of?" What does that mean? It means what it means. Well, James, I don't know where she is. But if you talk to her please tell her to call me. Please, I'm worried. What are you talking about? Could you just do that? Fine. Thank you. Hi. You've reached Amy's cell. Leave a message.

Good to see you. What's up? I was just in the neighbourhood seeing if you... I don't know, if you're not busy you want to take a little drive and have a coffee, or something. There's something I've wanted to talk to you about for a long time. You sure, we can't get you some breakfast, some eggs? Coffee? No, I'm good. I'm surprised I caught you at home at this time of the day. I work evenings, mostly. Doing what? They got me down at the Humane Society some nights. Oh yeah? You an animal lover? Someone's got to be there at nights, you know, in case there's any freak-outs. Cousin got me the job. Oh, shit. Sorry if I woke you up then, working nights. Naw, I don't sleep much. No? Why not? I heard you were in Afghanistan. I remember you were all into that military stuff in school. Joined the cadets, right? I remember you got teased a little bit for that. Yeah, I suppose. We were friends in third grade, you and me. If you remember we would play Star Trek on the playground. I'd always be Kirk and you'd be Spock. Remember that? You used to do the Vulcan-- Yeah. I got it. I got it. And then we just kind of drifted apart. Still I feel shitty for teasing, you know. I feel shitty for my part in that. And, I mean, it must make you angry to think back on those days. Now I know that it was mean. It was really mean. It was... It was weird, you know, we were friends for a year and then I spent the next ten torturing you. It was just relentless. I mean, it must have just seemed totally random to you. You know, "Why?" "Why me?" And I can't even answer that question, to be honest. It was just our screwed up idea of having fun. Hey, everything okay, man? Yeah. Sorry. That's all right. Hey, it's good to take your stuff home with you, but it's got to get done. Yeah, I know. I have a bit of a situation. I will get it to you. What's the ETA on the Myers account? James. Yeah, sorry. The Myers account. When is that happening? I'm really sorry. I have a bit of a situation at home, but I will have that to you by the end of the day. Yeah, promise. Okay.

But, otherwise, he looks the same? Like I said, it's not just the cat, there's the CD. Someone's been messing around with my computer. Something is going on. This is really what concerns me right here. Is this her handwriting? Yeah, I think so. So, she needed to clear her head. Something's going on. I mean, really, Mr. Deakin, who is going to go and replace your cat? Hello? Anybody home? Anybody here? Hello? What the hell are you doing? Jesus. How did you get in here? I want to speak to Amy. Come on. Let's go. What are you doing? Get out. What are you doing home on a work day? I want to speak to Amy. Amy? She's not here. Katherine, she's not here! She's not answering her phone so I want to know what's going on. Amy? Go. I want to talk to my sister, James. Yeah, and I want to talk to my wife. Get out. Come on, Katherine-- Don't touch me. Get out of my house. What is the matter with you? You're hurting my arm. Get the hell out of here then. You've done something, haven't you? So why can't I go and look then? I got a bit of a situation, Katherine. I don't want you meddling. Meddling in what? I'm handling it, okay. Just go. Get your hands off me. I'm really calling the police now, James. I've called the police. They don't do shit. I'm dealing with it. Jesus Christ! What the hell? Yes, they cut his head off. But you said the fake cat is still there? Yes. Amy is still gone. I haven't heard from her. Have you checked with work, her friends? Yes, I called all her friends, I checked with the school, I checked her e-mail. I called the airlines to see if she booked a flight, nothing. The note asked you not to contact her though, right? I told you, I don't think she wrote that note. Listen, I need you to figure out what's going on. All right? I need you to find my wife. We can file a report. That's great. Without any real evidence, it's all we can do. Listen, I'll just handle this myself then, okay. Mr. Deakin-- You don't believe me. I'll get you some evidence then. Amy? Amy, you there? Who is this? Jesus. Oh! Jesus Christ. Who the hell? Yeah, give me the police. Is anybody down there? Hello? Is anybody down there? All right, it takes a second. Right there. Who is it? I don't know who it is. Now watch this. He doesn't come out. He obviously, you know, got in here. And you say they did something to your cat? Did something? He cut his head off! There is still a cat. Yeah, there's a cat. It's a fake cat. It's a fake cat? Yeah. It looks the same but it's-- You're sure it's a fake? Yeah, I'm sure. Come here. This is what my cat looks like now. Jesus Christ. It's gone! What, you lost the head? No, I didn't. Whoever did this, came and they took it back. They took the cat head back? You saw the video. Someone's been coming and going in here. But you put the cat head in the freezer? Yeah. This hasn't come up a lot in my life. Is there a different protocol for severed cat head storage I should know about? I'm going to need you to calm down, sir. Calm down? When's the last time your cat was murdered? When's the last time your wife just disappeared? There was a note though, right, from your wife? Yeah. What are you going to do? What are you going to do about this? Well, what would you like us to do about it, Mr. Deakin? Take it seriously, for starters. I can assure you we are taking the disappearance of your wife very seriously. Have you and your wife had any trouble with any neighbours lately? No. Anyone from work, school? No. Can you think of anyone that might want to do this? You know, the last time we met, I remembered you were a big Jays fan. Got the whole team on there. Ninety-two championship team. Yeah, I know it. It looks new. It's mint condition. You're the first person to touch it in probably twenty years. Hmm. This must seem pretty weird to you. Just having a bad week. In fact, you might say I have a new-found understanding of probably what you went through in school. Just to be harassed, you know. Not know what's coming next. Not knowing what horrible shit they're going to do next. Look, I'm sorry about all that stuff. I mean it, Bill, anything you need ever, you let me know. I'm serious, man. I am not that guy-- Alright. --From school, you know. I mean, that guy was a monster. I'm not him. Yeah, all right. Has anyone ever done this before? No. Apologized for the bad stuff? No one's ever done this before. Does it help? The bad stuff still happened. Let me ask you a question, Bill. You know where my wife is? You don't you know where your wife is? No, I don't. Well, how would I know where your wife is? I'm not screwing around here, okay? If you've got a problem with me let's keep it between you and me. Amy didn't do anything wrong, okay? What? Is something funny? I'm just going to-- You're not going anywhere, Pock. Where's Amy?! Where the hell is she? You're still the same asshole, Deakin! You know that? Okay. If I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Okay? But you got to understand what I'm going through right now, all right? I understand. Karma's a bitch, huh? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I'll say it again, I don't know where she is. As far as I know she could be next to you laughing her ass off. James, I will bring the police. Bring them over, Katherine. They're not going to do anything, trust me. I don't trust you, James. I'm hanging up the phone now, okay. You better not have done any-- Oh, what's next? What's next, asshole? Yeah. Bring it on.

You're familiar with him then? Yeah, we went to school together. I haven't seen him in years. So you're suggesting he made this all up out of the blue. No. I called him. Like I said, I was checking people out from my past. But you didn't see him? No. Mind if I come in for a minute, Mr. Deakin? Why? Well, I just need to fill out a report. I'm heading to work. Well, if you prefer we can go down to the station. Yeah. Sure. After you. This is really against my better judgment, dude. You don't have to... Trust me it's in there. Okay. Thanks.
