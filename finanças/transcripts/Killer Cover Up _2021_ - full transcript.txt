State champions! You guys all played so great, okay, and we won this together! All right, Stacey, you run like lightning! -Yes! -That's me. And, grace, our star forward. When she kicks a ball, I swear she has four legs. It's...it's the seven years of riverdance lessons. And, Maria, okay, that quiet act does not fool me. I've seen her once go against four opponents and leave them all in tangles. Yeah! And Lilly, our goalie, hands sticky as a frog's... Where's Lilly? Lilly! Come on, what are you doing? Get over here. Uh-uh, no way are you sulking. Mm-mm. Drink it. All right, everybody, in the water! Let's go! Come on! Woo! I really don't feel like it. Come on. Let's go. Lilly? Lilly! Lilly! Lilly! It's nice. Right? And the weather. Makes it really hard to miss Detroit. I do not miss Detroit. I do kind of miss dad, though. What? You always tell me to be honest about my feelings. Mom, we've moved like a hundred times for your work and this is the first time that dad didn't move with us, so is this separation temporary, permanent, or... I get it. It's got to be really hard for you to figure out me and your dad when we don't even know ourselves. But I can tell you one thing that is permanent. How much you love me. Yeah, and what a good soccer player I am. Come on, Jenna tries to get the ball from her mom, but she can't, she can't, she can't, she can't! Mom shoo... Well, I never really liked that lamp anyway. You think I'll make the team at Fairmont? Are you kidding? You're the all-star MVP of east Pembroke high. Yeah, but they were state champions last year, and they may not even need a forward. If I don't keep my stats up, I could lose my scholarship to o.U. Mm-mm. Honey, when they see you play, you're gonna be exactly what they need. Is that like some magic mom thing, always being optimistic about everything? Hm, I don't know about other moms, but with a daughter like you, no magic is needed. Come on, let's go clean up some space for dinner. Dinner is served. It's not regurgitated, is it? No. This is beef stroganoff. It's a Russian delicacy. It's really delicate. Hi, dad. Um... Yeah, the house is super nice. It's a lot bigger than the apartment. Go say hi. Oh, um, I'll just... I'll see them later, yeah, at practice. Honey, practice might be more fun if you meet them now. Okay, forget it. Break a leg. Don't break a leg. I didn't mean that. Have fun today. Okay. The simplest example of energy transferring from one vector to another is the billiard ball. Like when the cue ball hits the eight-ball at an angle of about 45 deg... All right, everybody. Don't forget, homework, the end of chapter 23. That assignment is due tomorrow. Jenna Simms? Am I gonna see you at practice later? Oh, how did you know that I... Ritchie Hanover. Coach ritchie. Coach ritchie, yeah. Coach Hawthorne said she'd talk to you about me. Yeah, and she did. Says you're awesome. Come on, meet the girls. It's beautiful. Thank you. Hope you enjoyed your stay. Yeah, they're right over here. Let me ask the first ones. Guys, this is Jenna Simms, all-star forward from Detroit. Hi. Uh-oh, red, competition. I welcome competition, stace. What I don't welcome is you being such a... Easy, easy. Sorry, it's the first week back. Everyone is filled with adrenaline. We'll burn it out at practice. So, uh, grace is our forward. Though, we do need a goalie. I'm Alicia. Team captain. I can't wait to see what you've got. Give it a rest, 'Licia. You give it a rest, and I'll give it my best, Stacey. -Thanks. -Yeah. You guys be nice, okay? Hi. -You are Frieda, right? -Yes. I am so sorry it took me so long to introduce myself this morning. -I'm... -Mrs. Simms. Yes. -Please call me Sally. -Welcome to the palmetto. Thank you. Get it, Maria! Get it, Maria! -Come on, Maria! -Coach! -Woo! -Nice! Bring it in. Nice moves, 'Ria. Hey, you too, Jenna, that was great. But you know what? I would really love to see you play goalie. Can I get another shot? I've got a scholarship to o.U. And they've only seen me play forward. You've got a scholarship? Playing in college is great, Jenna. I want that for you. I want scholarships for everybody, but nobody gets there alone. We get there as a team. And we barely got there last year. You know he's right. I mean, if we didn't have a few lucky calls go our way last year, then that championship trophy could just as easily be in revere's display case. And we're gonna need more than luck to keep it in ours. As a team, we need a goalie. If you're great there, you'll start. If you only want to play forward, it'll have to be second string. All right. Everybody, back to one. Yes! Hey, don't take it easy on her. I know revere won't. Nice! All right, who's next? Looks like we have a new goalie. Shut it, grace. See what you started? Hey, I didn't mean to stir anything up at practice earlier. It wasn't you. You were actually great. Just Stacey doesn't like to be shown up. What happened to your old goalie? Everyone seems so sensitive about her. Yeah, um, Lilly, she... She disappeared. Yeah, everyone is so freaked out about it because, well, it's freaky. I mean, we had a party after the championship and Lilly was not into it. She wouldn't say why, like personal issues. Yeah, everyone went for a swim and when we came back out, she was gone. She drove off alone and that was it. What? Like she just didn't come back to school or something? She didn't come back at all. Cops found her car abandoned miles away, and we don't know if she ran away or was kidnapped. Oh my gosh, that's horrible. Party at my place? Grace was just telling her about Lilly. Oh, bad timing. Um, no, I just wanted to see if you wanted to come to my house Friday night, a little season kick-off soir√©e. Alicia's parents are like crazy jet-setters, so they go out of town all the time, and she throws the best parties. That's an exaggeration. They just go out of town a lot for work, but my parties are the bomb. Mm-hm. Come in. I've been thinking about this. I don't like the idea of this at all. You come home, tell me that girl disappeared, and now you want to go to a party? She disappeared months ago, it was like end of last year. Do you think that really matters to her mother? She's still missing, Jenna. I know. It's horrible, mom, but... You said that we were moving to California, and I came. And you said that dad wasn't coming with us, and I'm doing my best with that. And, now, I'm going to a new school. I just made the team, and... I really just want to go celebrate with them. -Whose party is it? -Alicia. She's the team captain. And are her parents gonna be there? I guess. Well, I'd like to talk to them. I don't have their number. Okay, then I'm going to say hello when I drop you off. Can I go? Yes. You can go. Thank you. You look pretty. Thank you. You don't have to walk with me. I'm not gonna walk with you, I just want to say hi. Just stay right there. Have fun. Wow. You look amazing. Well, why blend in when you can stand out? Does it highlight my hair? "Does it highlight my hair?" I could never pull off something like that. Well, it wasn't meant for you to pull off. Oh. Lighten up, Maria. The world doesn't revolve around your insecurities. Oh, wow. -Can I get you a drink? -Oh, uh... So I was just telling you about Billy Wayne. Cute and cocky. A deadly combination. You can do better. I wanted to say sorry about earlier. You deserved a much warmer welcome than that, and that's on us, not you. I just want to play soccer. We all do. Um, Jamal Tanner. Straight as. No girlfriend. Mark David. Golf and swimming. He's probably gonna go to Harvard. And Ken Andrews... You want to dance? Baseball player. Emphasis on the player. And, sadly, he slays me. I'm sure we'll burn these off in, like, two drills on Monday. It's a good party. Yeah. I'm really excited to be on the team. I used to be. -Used to be? -Look, um, you seem like a great girl and a great player, but I don't want to let you down. This team isn't all it used to be. Grace! Grace, come on. Grace. She's still breathing. Call 911! Okay. Jenna, are you okay? She was just dancing and... Good morning. Are you hungry? No, not really. That had to be really hard for you to see that last night. I lied. About what? I do miss Detroit. I miss my dad in Detroit and my friends in Detroit. I miss my school and my soccer team. Mom, why do we have to move around for work so much? -Because it's my job, honey. -It's always your job. Dad never made us move. He gives up his job every couple years to move for you. -Okay, that is not fair. -Oh, is this where you ground me for being too honest about my feelings? No. Look, this is really hard, and I think that you have done an amazing job handling it all. A little breakfast? Please? Hi, I'm Sally Simms. I'm the new manager of the hotel. I'm looking for the owner, Mr. Rocklin? Yeah, I, um, think I saw him around here somewhere. Can I get you something to drink? Iced tea? Lemonade? With a twist? I would love some iced tea, but you can save the twist. So... What do you think about the place so far? I like it. Thank you. What do you think about it? Looking for speed bumps? Word travels fast around here. Well, you know, it's a small hotel. You know, there is one thing I don't like about this place. -What's that? -It's never had a manager that would take two minutes out of their day to sit and have an iced tea with the bartender. -Well, I... -Would you like to go over tonight's dinner reservations, Mr. Rocklin? Give us a couple minutes, cin, please. Mr. Rocklin. Very funny. Oh, you know, all kidding aside, the fact that you sat down with me, asked how things were without knowing who I am, that says a lot about you. Iced tea is on the house, anytime. Thank you. Nice. Okay, work it up, work it up. Watch Alicia at the wing. Back to the goal. -Come on, Alicia. -Come on, Stacey, keep going, keep going! -Hey! Whoa, whoa! -Stop, Maria! What are you doing? What are you guys doing? She ran me over! All right, look, okay, I get it. What happened to grace is terrible for me as her coach, and I can't even imagine what you guys are going through, but you can't take it out on each other. You got to put it into your playing 'cause if you don't, you can forget about another championship, college scholarships, all of it. Let's run it back, let's run it back. Lighten up, Maria! -Stacey. -What? Her blubbering... Shut up! Just shut up, Stacey! This is all your fault! First Lilly and now grace! That's enough! Okay, let's just focus on practice. I guess someone is happy they get to finally play forward now. I'm not happy. I mean, anybody else find it strange that the week she shows up we lose grace? -You think I had something... -I think you don't belong here. Grace will be back, you'll see. And we still need a goalie. Stacey scares me. Yeah, Stacey is scary. It's her defense mechanism. No, I think... I think she pushed grace. Maria, you're imagining things. No, I'm serious. I think she shoved grace down the stairs because she was scared of covering up Lilly. Don't talk about it. Okay, don't talk about anything, Maria. If you think that Stacey pushed grace to keep her quiet, you should be careful. She could do it again. -Sorry, are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I know that things seem pretty heated on the team right now. Do you have any concerns beyond just, you know, pushing through? Uh, no, no. Okay. Look, I know that it's hard coming to a new school, new team, fitting in. You're doing really great. Maria! Hey, Maria. Um, so practice was pretty intense. Hey, what's going on between you and Stacey? Nothing. Just because you guys seemed really tense at the party... I have to go. What the... Did you guys see what happened to my bike? No, no one saw, no one saw. Good pizza here. Who knew? Mm-hm. But more importantly, how was the salad? I made it. Oh, yeah. Um... You cut a mean vegetable. Right? So how was your day? -My day? -Yeah. How was it? Was it average or extraordinary? Oh, uh, no, not... Not really. All right. How was practice? It was okay. I guess the girls are still all pretty freaked out about grace. Can only imagine. Are you? What about you? Exceptional day? Uh... Honey, how would you feel... ...if your father and I... Getting back together? No. Your father, he, um... Um... Well, how would you feel if we got a divorce? What? Why would you even say that? What's wrong with you? Who doesn't love morning laps? Come on, guys, give me some energy. If we do well this morning, maybe coach will take it easy on us this afternoon. Someone messed with my bike yesterday. Your bike? Normally, I'd just think new girl stuff, but after grace, I don't know. Neither do I. Thanks. Fast in the water, you'll be like lightning on the field. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey, come on, Maria! Push, push, push, Maria! Come on, put some muscle in it. Come on, Maria, push! Come on, Maria! You're lagging in the pool, on the field. Like, we're not gonna win another championship. Just leave me alone! All right. That's it for this morning, ladies. See you all this afternoon. Look, I heard you talking to Alicia, talking about Stacey, talking about Lilly's cover-up. No, you didn't. You're new here, you don't know anything. Just leave me alone. Hey, have you seen my sweater? No, sorry. You guys didn't check on Maria? Maria? Help! Help, please! Someone help! It's Maria! Oh my...Maria? Are you okay? Everyone, I'm principal Butler. Mr. and Mrs. Tapia, I'm so sorry for your loss. There's nothing that I can say to make sense of this tragic, horrible accident. Was it an accident? Are you sure it was an accident? As opposed to what? One is an accident. Three girls? One missing, one comatose, and now one... I'm starting to feel like I can't trust my daughter in your care. I understand your concern, but two of these events, they happened outside of school, during parties. They happened on the team! Now... Perhaps some time off would... Dad, no, no, no. Mom, I can't. When I ran into the gym and I saw that girl's parents, all I could think was... Soccer is not worth it, honey. Nothing is. I wish it hadn't happened. Mom, I wish none of this had happened, but if I don't play this year, then I could lose my scholarship. I'm not saying to quit, I'm just saying take a couple weeks off after seeing your friends like that. But the season starts in a couple of weeks and if everyone takes off, then what will we have? Please, mom. Fine, but short leash. No parties. You have to come to the hotel every day after school. And I don't care, if anyone else on the team gets hurt, if it's an accident, I don't care, you're done. Okay. Again. Again! I heard you. -What do you mean? -Outside. Maria said that she was scared of Stacey, some cover about Lilly. Maria said she was scared of Stacey, and you told her to be careful. -No, I didn't. -You told her to be careful and now she's... Grace is still in the hospital. Someone's been taunting me, destroyed my bike. Why would Stacey want me gone? I don't know, but if she does, all the more reason to be quiet. Dad! So, what are you doing here? How long have you been here? Does mom know you're here? I'm gonna take those questions in reverse if that's okay. Uh, no, your mom does not know I'm here. I'm trying to work it out. Um, been here a week. -A week? -Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you over the phone. Just trying to figure everything out, you know? But I miss you, Jenna. I miss your mom, too. But if I'd snuck up behind her while she was waiting on a bus, she'd probably have... Yeah, she'd probably throw you in front of it. I was gonna say "call the cops," but you think she'd throw me under the bus, huh? Throw me in front of it? I don't know, I just mean she doesn't really explain your situation to me. It's complicated, sweetie. Your mom's a great woman, you know that. All this hasn't been easy on her either. But I'm thinking about moving out here. You want to get back together with mom? No...yeah, of course, hopefully soon. I want to get back together with you first, though. You see, I put my foot down with your mom. I told her I didn't want to change jobs with her again and follow her out here. She called my bluff. But if I'd known it'd come to all this, I would've gotten in a car and driven out right behind you guys. No job is worth being away from you this long, Jenna. So I need to ask you a favor. You don't have to do it if you don't want to, but just like with you, I'm trying to figure out how to approach your mom and all, so... I won't tell her until you're ready. Awesome. -I love you, dad. -I love you too, baby. I'm so excited you're here! Come on. Hi, honey. Welcome to the palmetto. Chloe, this is my daughter, Jenna. -Hi. -Hi. So how was your day? Oh, uh, nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing out of the ordinary at that school is out of the ordinary. Come on. Is this quiet enough for you to study? I guess, though I was kind of hoping for the pool. Hm, well, this is where I work, so this is where you study. Love you. Ready? Yeah. Hey, Ken. What do you mean grace's fall wasn't an accident? Lilly, grace, Maria, all coincidence? If not, then what? Like some kind of message? My bike. It couldn't have been any clearer if someone had just painted "stay out of it" on the seat. Someone wants me off this team and far away from all of this. -Stacey? -I'm not sure. Look, I've been with grace since the 10th grade. I want to find whoever did this to her and kill 'em. But you just got here. If you want to stay out of it, no one is gonna blame you. Alicia... What's going on? What's the cover-up? I feel so horrible. I... If I had said something or come forward, then maybe grace and Maria wouldn't... Lilly didn't disappear. -What are you doing? -Don't even start with me. We've been drinking, grace. What? Do you think they're just gonna say "oh, well"? We're all underage. No college will want to give a scholarship to any of us after something like this, that's if we don't go to jail. Jail? So I went along. We pushed her body out to sea and moved her car and lied. And the worst part was seeing her mom. But grace was cracking. Okay, we could all tell that she was gonna say something. So, I think that Stacey pushed her down the stairs to keep her quiet which got Maria upset. Alicia, you're gonna say something now, aren't you? Alicia, you have to. Scholarships don't matter. Maria is dead. That's why I can't. Okay, I thought Lilly drowned. But if Stacey pushed grace and hurt Maria, that's doing a lot more than covering up an accident, okay? What if Stacey killed Lilly? -Wait, what? Why? -I don't know. Okay, but that would explain why she pushed for the cover-up. Okay, no autopsy, no cause of death. I don't know, maybe if we just called the police, then...then we wouldn't go to jail, but now we will for sure. Unless I can prove that Stacey killed Lilly. But I'm gonna need your help. -Me? -Jenna, please. I mean, you're the only one that Stacey doesn't have a reason to hurt. You're the only one that can figure things out without ending up like... Like Lilly, grace, or Maria. Alicia, I don't know. What would I even do? Like, break into her locker, steal her backpack? This is dangerous. It's not like she's some hardened criminal. Okay, you've seen how on edge she is. Just egg her on. See if you can get her to crack. If you don't help me, the team is through. Okay, even if they don't break us up, we're not going to championships. You can see that. None of us are going to college. Not playing soccer, anyway. All right. Let's pack it up. Change of scenery. We're gonna try something a little bit different today. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Everybody, up. Come on. Doing okay? Hey, what's going on? This is the beach where Lilly disappeared. Come on, girls, let's go. I know that this is a hard place for you guys to be, okay? Last time you were here, you had three more friends with you. That was also the last time that you guys played like a team. The night of the state championships. Now I know that Maria and grace and Lilly would not want you to lose this year because losing them tore you apart. They would want you to win for them. That's what I want. Look, if that isn't what any of you want, you're welcome to leave right now. Okay then. Everyone, in the water. You guys want to start playing like a team, huh? Trusting and supporting each other? Let's start where it counts. Past where you can stand, everyone holding hands. Let's see if you can keep each other afloat for a minute. One girl comes in, you all start over. Fifteen seconds! Thirty seconds! -I need a break! -We're almost there! Forty-five seconds! -No, you don't! -No one goes in! Three, two! All the way in, holding hands! Woo! Ow! Woo! Now that is what I like to see, ladies! Let's go! I got a recruiter coming next week from o.U. You guys show up like this, maybe there's scholarships for more of you. That would be great. Why do you care? You already got a scholarship. I still want to win. Honestly, we've got a better chance without you. Is that why you messed up my bike? Trying to get rid of me? I didn't touch your bike. -Hey. -Back off, Stacey! Seriously, guys? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get off of each other! Come on! Seriously? Seriously, what is it gonna take, huh? One more scene like this and both of you are off the team, okay? -Sir. -Thank you. I'm very flattered. Very. It's just that dating isn't really on the table for me right now. What was on the table last night? Dinner? New to town, working mom, teenage daughter. I'm guessing... Pizza and pasta. Wrong. Pizza and salad. Speaking of food, I want to show you something. I need your opinion, please. -Okay. -Come with me. So I'm starting a new line of home meals. Always fresh, never frozen. Just stick 'em in the oven for 30 minutes. No microwaves allowed. But I need an honest opinion before I bring it to market 'cause I'm biased. Everyone that works for me just tells me it's great. I'm sure they are. And my sons, they just eat pizza, so what do they know? -You have sons? -I do, yes. Jake is 12 and Ryan is 16, so they're not gonna get a refined palate for another decade. -Probably. -Yeah. So, please, I need your opinion. Let me know how it is. Take it home. Feed your daughter. I'm gonna be honest. -Please. -Okay. -Thank you. -Enjoy. Thank you. Da-Da-Da-Da! Dinner is served. I'm not really hungry. Well, it's not really an option. You're gonna force-feed me? Yeah, if I have to. Come on. Come on, I have a surprise for you. Another one and last one. -But don't look. -I'm not. Okay, I'm gonna put you in your chair right here. -Okay, ready? Sit down. -Mm-hmm. -Oops, sorry. -Okay. And, ta-Da! -Impressive, right? -This looks amazing! How did you do this? Wait, are you questioning my culinary expertise? -With every bone in my body. -Fine. I got it from the hotel restaurant. Oh, so it's take-out? No, it's not take-out, I cooked this. I turned the ov... I turned the oven on, and then I put it in. Doesn't matter, eat it, and enjoy it. Mm-hm! That's really good. -Right? -Mm-hm, good job, mom. Thank you. Honey, I owe you an apology. I have moved you and asked a lot of you, and you sacrificed a lot. You told me. Yes, I told you. When you were eight, obviously you never questioned it, but now that you're almost 18, I, I just have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that you're almost an adult. An adult? Almost an adult, I said. And I'm just hangin' on to every single moment of your childhood while I still can whether you like it or not, so don't make fun of me. Eat up and enjoy. So...ah... How was practice? Um... I don't know. Coach has o.U. Coming to practice, and I like playing goal, I'm just not that good yet. So, if they see me now, they'll definitely pull my scholarship. Well, it's too bad your dad's not here. Look, honey just because we're not getting along right now doesn't mean that he's not an amazing father. I mean, he's been the best coach you've ever had! I think if he had some time with you, he would make you a great goalie too. Why don't you facetime him? Uh, yeah! Yeah, I'd love some facetime with dad. That's Stacey Robbins right there with the ball. She's aggressive, but she's good. Jenna, it's in the box, grab it! Get your arms around it! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come on, come on, come on! You okay? Are you crazy? What? I was just goin' for the ball. Just because it wasn't a foul doesn't mean it was fair. You guys see what you're doin'? Thought you wanted scholarships. You're losing your recruiter right now. Laps, everybody, let's go. Cover-up? Jenna, if your team is dangerous... Please don't sound like mom. Well, I'm sorry, but despite our differences, your mom and I are lock-step when it comes to parenting. You have to tell her. She'll make me quit! Where else am I supposed to go play for my scholarship? Sunday pick-up games in the park? Fine, I'll tell her... After the season's over. When I get back to the hotel. So you're serious, you liked it? I loved it, it was fantastic! I thank you, Jenna thanks you. My only question is when can I buy stock in your company? Was it fantastic enough to have dinner with me outside of the home? Um... There's this, uh, great little place just down the street. Mom! Jenna! Excuse me. -I'm sorry. -Honey, wait! -Leave me alone. -Jenna! Jenna! Do you even know that dad wants to get back together with you? That he's here trying to figure out how to talk -to you about all this. -Your father's here? He wants us to be a family again. Wait, are you telling me your dad is here, Jenna? Is that what you just said? Joe, you came here without telling me, and you were seeing Jenna in secret? No, do not "shared custody" me! You let Jenna move here! You... You agreed to it. Ugh! Under duress, Joe, are you kidding me? You're joking, right? You are unbelievable! Why don't you go back to Detroit? -Why don't you go to hell? -Stop! Look! What did I tell you guys, huh? Work together, and you'll be champions. But if you keep letting anger tear you apart, you will never be more than high school athletes forced to give up the game they love, or become a coach and have to put your faith in others instead of yourself! Laps, everybody, let's go. Come on, come on, let's go! Let's go, trouble-maker. This is ridiculous. We're gonna be a cross country team. -What are you doing? -Stay back! Please, this is just routine. We're gonna let the officer do his job. You can't just open our lockers. Actually, the school does have that right, especially after learning that Grace McShay might have been pushed down those stairs and Maria murdered! Murdered? Learned how? An anonymous call. So you think one of us did it? You're the one who was fighting with Maria. -On the field. -And in the pool. About her playing. Whose is this? Mine. I lost that. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's goin' on here? What is that? Maria tapia's blood. Someone put it in there. Why would I want to hurt Maria? I just met her. You tell me. -Jenna, are you okay? -I'm okay. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Does she need a lawyer? I don't have enough to arrest her. She said someone took the sweater. It's possible somebody used it, and put it back. But if I get anything more connecting your daughter to this, or to the other girl that was injured, -grace mcshay. -This isn't about grace or Maria, it's about Lilly! Lilly Washington? The girl who disappeared last spring? She didn't disappear, she died, she drowned on the beach with them, and everyone got so scared, so Stacey told them to cover it up. But grace wasn't happy, so Alicia thinks that Stacey pushed her down the stairs. So when Maria complained... Okay, okay, okay, slow down. We interviewed everyone on the team when Lilly disappeared, when grace was injured, and again this morning. Do you know how much anyone has said about a cover-up? -Nothing, no drowning. -Because they are the ones who are covering it up! -Alicia told me... -Even Alicia. Because she's scared! She thinks that you're gonna arrest everyone, they're all gonna lose their chance at going to college! That's why she wanted me to help prove that Stacey was the one that murdered Lilly, so that none of the other girls would... Murdered? You just said drowned. Well, no, I mean, like, um... Do you have any proof, Jenna? Some shred of evidence that my entire department has not been able to find? Because right now, the only thing that I have is Maria tapia's blood on your sweater. Here you go. -You bake now? -Sort of. I mean, they're premade by a friend, I just popped them in the oven. As long as I don't play soccer anymore. Honey, you heard I told the principal. That what? I can keep playing until I am arrested? Everyone hates me now, mom. Think you can change hotels again? Now would be a really good time to move. Why don't you go climb in my bed, and I'll be in there in a minute, okay? I guess I should have told you I was here? Or, maybe, you should have asked me if you can come. I don't need your permission to see Jenna. How 'bout just common courtesy, huh? I mean, you're teaching her to sneak behind my back! Something that you're very familiar with. She is happy you're here. And you? Don't ask me about me. You're not gonna like what I have to say. It's work. Hello? Hi, Sally, it's Dan. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure everything's okay. Hey, Dan. Thanks for checkin' in. Um. Listen, uh, things are, uh, kind of hectic around here. Well, call me if you need me, all right? I should go. Uh, bye. I guess that's my cue to leave. Can we talk? Thought you were talking to Dan? We've barely been here a month, mom, and you already have a boyfriend? -Honey, he is not... -I already told you that dad wants to get back together with you. Honey, your father and I... Tell me it's complicated, and I'll scream. Your father... You know I met him when I was 18 years old, right? And he was funny, and he was so sexy. -That's... -And... ...and we fell in love. And got married, and had this amazing human who's now almost a grown up. And over those years, we just, we grew apart. Not my career, not just his career, but us. And it had nothing to do with you, and this is not your fault. It's not fair. I know it's not fair. But look, my head is spinning right now with all this unfairness of what's happening to you... -I didn't do anything. -I know you didn't do anything, but it's gonna take a lot of convincing to other people. And that's gonna take a lot of energy. Maybe just go to bed and get some sleep? Okay? Okay. Good night. What was that? It's dad. I was in my car and saw someone speed away. You guys okay? Yeah, look at this. What in the world? I'm gonna go check on Jenna. I'm sorry this happened. You're sorry? Being sorry does not help my 17-year-old daughter who is accused of these horrible things, or this home invasion, I just, I don't understand why you're not gonna do anything about this? Your daughter is still our prime suspect. Then I will prove that she's innocent by myself. Don't do anything by yourself, Mrs. Simms. That never goes well. Look, no one is gonna fight harder to protect Jenna than me. And if you're not gonna do something about this, then I will. -Be in touch. -Mm. Please take me home with you. Baby, in my crappy little hotel? No, to home! To Detroit, to anywhere, anywhere but here! Sweetie, for the next few months, 'till you finish school, 'till you're 18, you have to stay with mom. Dad, I hate it here. Jenna... ...this is not your fault. It's not mom's fault, either. I was seeing another woman. It's over now. Your mom left because of me. This is my fault, not hers. Jenna, I... I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? Dad told me what he did. I've thought about it many times, but I figured it was best coming from him. Be you let me be mad at you all this time, and, like, to blame you for everything. Honey, I'm your mom. I can handle you being mad at me. Listen, I know I told the principal she could shove it, but you don't have to go to school today if you don't want to. Whoever's doing this is trying to cover up Lilly, and grace, and Maria, and I won't let them cover me up too. We're living in a nightmare and you're grinning? Yeah! Because I love you. Alicia! Alicia! Hey, hey! Why didn't you say anything about Lilly? I told you I needed proof. Okay, did you get me proof? No, all you did was get yourself implicated. All I did? You were the one who put me up to this! Because I thought you'd be safe. Okay, Stacey doesn't have anything over you. I know she tried to frame you. Well, then that's why you need to say something! Alicia, please! Tell coach ritchie, tell the principal, tell the police! Tell them about Lilly so they don't think I'm crazy! I will, okay, but we need to prove that she murdered her. Force equals mass times acceleration is whose second law of motion? All right, come on, guys, let's focus, okay? Isaac Newton. Now, can anybody tell me when Isaac Newton was born? Have a nice day, guys. Jenna, look, I have no idea what's been goin' on with this crazy year, okay? I don't know if you did anything or not. I mean, I hope that you didn't, but principal Butler said she can't make you stay home, so I'm asking you to. It just won't be good for you, or for the team, or anyone. I'm coming to practice. Okay. Dive on it, nice! -I didn't do anything! -Neither did I! You didn't cover up Lilly's death? You didn't push grace down the stairs? -No! -You didn't kill Maria? You didn't put her blood on my sweater? -Liar! -Hey! -Hey! You look here! -Break it up! Let me know if you need anything else. Uh-huh. Hey, honey! What happened to your eye? I didn't run away. Well, the principal should be looking out for -things like this. -For what, mom? A thousand kids who all wanna kill me? Why would Stacey kill you? -Why'd you do it? -I didn't do anything! You killed Maria, did you push grace? Ken? Ken, I didn't kill Maria, and I didn't push grace, but I think I know who did. Who? That's Stacey's. You sure this is a good idea? Not really. Hey, um, I'm sorry. I was angry and confused. We all are. I'll wait here. Engine running. Hey! Stop! Arrested for breaking and entering, Jenna? I can't even! -Technically, I didn't enter. -Really? You're gonna be smug now? I had you still in school, still on the team. Don't you get it? This is all the principal needs to suspend you from both. -What are you doing? -Calling dad. What are you doing? Parenting. No phone, no computer, no TV. -You are grounded. -No, you can't do that. -That's not... -And no talking. Go to your room. I hate it here! Hey! Hey! Just because you're not going to school today does not mean you have the day off. Breakfast, dressed, homework, let's go! Come on, get up! Dad's gonna come by later and check on you. Love you. What were you so upset about? Do you even know? Do you? One of you has to be willing to speak. Grace. -Alicia. -I have class. Don't! Stop, stop, stop! And I have a daughter who might go to jail for something that you know that she didn't do. -You have to tell the truth! -Hey, hey, hey! Get your hands off of her! What do you think you're doin'? Do you have any idea what's happening here? I know you can't just come in here and accost the students. Look, you need to leave, okay? Now. Truth. Jenna! Got all the stuff to make your favorite sandwich. Jenna? Jenna? Joe? Sally. What are you doin' with Jenna's phone? Well, I took it away from her last night. What do you mean she left the house? I can't, can you... Can you please just go to the hotel and see if she's there? Okay, thanks, just let me know as soon as you find her. Mrs. Washington? Can I come in? They're beautiful, Mrs. Simms, thank you. You can call me Sally, please. So... Why do you think that my daughter's disappearance is anything other than the unsolved mystery the police say it is? Because my daughter tells me otherwise, and I believe her. So you're here today to get my hopes up that my Lilly will come home? No. I don't think that anything I would do could bring your daughter back. I just have this feeling that if I can prove that my daughter's innocent, it might shed some light on someone else's guilt, and maybe that would bring you some comfort? But not a lot, I'm sure. I am so sorry that this is happening to you, Mrs. Washington. Camilla. Camilla. Do you think it would be okay if I take a look in your daughter's room and maybe go through her things? Yeah. I've been through everything. I don't know what you'll find. Me either. Excuse me, I'm looking for Sally Simms. -She's right this way. -Thank you. Jenna. Are you in there? -Jenna? -Can I help you? Yes, my daughter, Jenna Simms, may be in there. Maybe by the pool? Oh, grace. I'm so sorry. I came here wanting you to help me. Now I just want you to wake up. I'm gonna find out who's doing this! For you, and Maria, and... -Ken, I'm sorry, I was just... -No, it's okay. What you did for me the other day, running past, that was big. She called me that night before the party. She said, she said, "I'm not coming, but when you see the girl in the red jumpsuit, ask her to dance." She's a great girl. If she knew what I did to you, she'd hate me. She'll never hear it from me. When she wakes up, she'll hear from me that you never stopped trying to figure out who did this to her. But I have! I don't know where to go or what to do! I don't know anything about Lilly or Maria! But maybe she did. Thank you, Mrs. Mcshay. If we find anything. Where do you keep your diary? I don't. "Why blend in when you can stand out?" You go. She wouldn't want me to. Grace says Alicia threatened her. Detective Willow. This is Sally Simms. I have a lead for you. I told you not to get into things on your own, Mrs. Simms. And I told you I was going to. Do you want the information or not? Richard Hanover? Police department. Richard Hanover, police department! Alicia threatened grace? Why? "It's not just about Lilly disappearing. Alicia's hiding something, I know she is." Does she say what? I gotta talk to Alicia. My mom's got my, um... Can I get a ride? It has something to do with the scores, or I don't know, but look. So what do we do now? I don't see why I have to help them with anything after their daughter tried to come in here... Because! I'm telling you to? Coach ritchie? These are our games from last year. But why did she cross out the scores? We were hoping you could tell us that. This game, we tied into overtime, and there was an offsides. I won it by a penalty kick. I mean, a lot of these games were close, and we had a lot of lucky calls, but so what? We kicked every goal. So, why would Lilly change the scores? Why did she circle the coach's face? You said we weren't supposed to see each other. Yeah, I know. I know, but I missed you. I'd hide that too! I missed you too, ritchie. I, I just, I don't feel right about all of this. What, you don't feel right about us? No, no, no, I love you, I do, I just... Jenna, she doesn't deserve what we're doing to her. Hey, hey. We don't talk about any of that. Ritchie, it's tearing me up, and who else am I gonna go to? Maybe it would have been better if we never won championships to begin with. Hey, baby, don't say that. Okay? With last year's championship, and another this year, we're gonna be set. You're gonna get a scholarship. I'm gonna get a college coaching job. But we're gonna win on our own this time, right? You're not gonna pay off the refs again? Paying off the refs? You guys are good, you guys are great, but you really wanna leave your future to chance like that? I don't. Jenna, hey, hey, hey. Jenna, Jenna, be cool, be cool. Be cool, it's okay. It's okay. Come here, it's okay. It's okay, don't do anything stupid. -Don't do anything stupid. -Alicia! Were you spyin' on us in there? Let's go. You're all right. Go, Alicia. How 'bout a little team reunion here, let's go. So you think Lilly found out the coach was fixing their games? And killed her? Yes. Oh, my god. So I helped him? That night when I told everybody to cover it up, if I would have just called the police, then they would have known Lilly was murdered, but I... If I would have just called the police, then grace and Maria, they'd... Stacey, you can call the police now and tell them the truth! Lilly's mom deserves that. Do you have any idea where Jenna could be? Wait, um, ritchie could have murdered Maria, but he couldn't have pushed grace. He wasn't even at the party. Alicia's party? I'm actually really glad that you came by, Jenna, it's sort of perfect, right? See, Alicia and I have been working really hard to make sure you take the fall for Maria and grace. She has been quite the trooper, let me tell ya. I mean, it would have been a lot cleaner if that push had killed grace, but, hey, she did the best she could at the time. Alicia, no! She got the sweater into your locker, huh! She really has been a good girl. And now, now that the cops' number one suspect has come to kill my team captain, well, it looks like I get to save the day! -Wait, wait, wait! -Hey, don't, don't talk about her not deservin' it, Alicia, okay? She tried to kill grace so she could play forward, killed Maria when she found out, and now is here to kill you for the same reason, okay? That's ridiculous to kill for a soccer position! No one would even believe you! No? Not even for a scholarship to college? To live your dreams? Of course you would do that. -I did. -No! -What are you doing? -Please stop! You can't kill her, please! Wait, this is too much. We've done too much! Baby, it was supposed to be you and me together forever. Now it looks like I'm gonna be a little too late to save you. What? Hurry, Joe! I love you, babe. -Hey! -Dad! You're okay, you're okay. Jenna. Jenna, I'm so sorry! Jenna, I just got really confused and scared. Jenna, I'm so sorry! Pass it! Pass it! Oh, that's me, that's me. Stacey, yes! Look, just because you play forward does not mean you can pass me. Oh, not even with four legs? Jenna's a much more natural goalie than she ever was a forward. She was an all-star forward, watch this. -Yes! -Yeah! That was good, okay? Sorry about your bike. You did do it, I knew it! No, you didn't. Ladies, bring it in, here we go! Jenna! So good! -That's my girl. -Thanks, dad. All right, Sidney, take us out. Fairmont on three, here we go! All right, ladies! Fairmont! Fairmont! Fairmont! Jenna!
