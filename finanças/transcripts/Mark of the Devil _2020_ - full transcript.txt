"THAT IS NOT DEAD WHICH CAN ETERNAL LIE. AND WITH STRANGE EONS EVEN DEATH MAY DIE." There was nothing I could do. We can't bury him here. 30 YEARS LATER The Canaanite languages, as well as the Aramaic and Ugaritic, are all part of the subgroup of northern occidental Semitic languages. Okay. That's all for today. We'll meet again next week. How did it go? Could you give me some money? I'm on my way out. Where? I'm having dinner with Diego, and we're going to a bar after that. Camila, weren't we having dinner together? But it's Saturday. Spending a Saturday with your family won't kill you. We can spend the day together tomorrow. We can go to the... mall. We'll have dinner at home, and then you can leave, okay? - Can I invite Diego? - Sure. Okay, you tell him. - Hi. - Hi, ma'am. - How are you, Diego? - Fine. - Would you like to come over for dinner? - Yes, I'd love to. Great, I'll go with Diego and I'll see you there. Okay. Bye. Doctor, we received a manuscript from Durango. Could you come and see it? Can't it wait till Monday? I doubt you'd want to wait. This must be the oldest manuscript I've ever seen. I can't believe how well preserved it is. Who... Who brought it, and for what purpose? It was delivered by a messenger. Has anyone else seen it yet? No. Please, tell the doctor that I'll have a detailed summary as soon as possible. - I'll take it with me. - Okay. Thank you. I'm home! What the... Son of a... Are you going to work? It's urgent, but it's not an emergency. And the girls? In their rooms. And dinner? - Luis. - Yes? Dinner? It's almost ready, sweetheart. Please, don't leave that in the living room. Yes, honey. Fernanda, watch out! What's that? Work. Nothing special. Sure, Mom. I believe you. Hey, I'm serious. I don't like you going through my things, okay? Whatever you say, boss. Sorry, I didn’t know you were here. Don't worry. What's up? Nothing, it's just that I wanted to show you something from... - I'll be right there. - Yes, yes. No, wait. Don't you want to? Yes, but it's kind of weird when my family is here, too. What if my dad opens the door? What's that? I'm sorry. I didn't want to... I didn't know you two were... It was nothing. Did you guys do it already? No. - Why so slow? - You walked in on us. No, I'm kidding. - I don't want it to happen here. - Where, a hotel, then? Am I interrupting? No, no, never, no. In fact, I was showing this book to Camila. Very interesting. Mom brought it today. What's this? It looks like the Necronomicon. What's a Necronomicon? It's a book of rituals to invoke the Ancients. The Book of the Dead, have you heard... It's fiction. Lovecraft made it up in his stories, back in the '20s. That's what you think. Did you invoke the Ancients? Obviously. - How many? - Five. - Did you hook up with any? - Obviously. Have you done any of the rituals? No, I thought about doing them, but it's too complicated. It's just to have fun. You're taking it too seriously. No! Hey, everything can and should be subjected to the scientific method. Otherwise, you'd believe in all kinds of nonsense. - It could be demonstrated. - What if we give it a try? That way, we can see whether it's true or not. I like that idea. Okay. - We must hold each other's hands. - Candles? Come on, cut the crap. - What language is this? - Latin. I don't speak Latin. Let me see. Read it already. "I hereby offer my body as a vessel for darkness, Ctulhu. And with these words, I state you have been great, Cthylla, daughter of Ctulhu..." Holy shit! Wow! No fucking way! This way, please. Good afternoon, to all of you. My name is Karl Nüni. Thank you for coming, Father. I'm not a priest. What should I call you, then? You've locked her up. Please, don't hurt my mother. She's old. Guadalupe Rodríguez, are you here? Demon, show yourself. I am your God. Open the door, Father, open! Mom! Mom! Mom! What did you do to her, asshole? - Mom! - Mommy. Are you okay? Are you okay? Does it hurt? That'll be enough. May the Lord repay you, Father. What's up, white boy? Did the price go up? No, it's all there. Bullshit, Jorge. I can get you some more if you want. Just forget about it. Go in peace, child. I hear you. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Tell me, child. Child? Don't you want to know how it went? You're alive. That answers the question. Where are you going? Everybody needs to get rid of their own demons. How did it go with the family? Okay? I'm wiped out. What about a little pick-me-up? In the end, it was good for both of us, right? You will never understand, unless... To each his own. You wouldn't understand it either. Unless... Hey... Karl... Don't remain in the darkness. Enjoy it. ROME, ITALY, GERMANY Fernanda? What's up? I thought I told you not to. Sorry, I won't do it again. We're leaving, Dad. Perfect. You look great! - Call me if you need anything, okay? - Yes. - Have a great time. Bye. - Bye. Romina! - How are you? - Fine, and you? How are you? Are we still going camping? Let's get something to drink. - Three tequilas? - Tequila. Three tequilas, please! No tequila? Just water. - One water. - One water. Hey, what the hell? We're in line! - She's feeling sick. - I don't give a shit, get in line! - Shut up, bitch! - I don't give a shit. - Camila! - Hey! Are you okay? Hey. Hey, are you okay? Hey. What are you doing? What? Let's go. Hi! Good morning. I want some. - Don't burn yourself! - No. - Morning. - Morning! Hi. - Is it ready? - Yes, I'll serve you now. It smells delicious. Thanks. What? Hey, go get your sister. It's good. Camila, breakfast's ready. Camila. Hey, come on, wake up. Do you want me to bring you breakfast? Camila... Camila. Are you okay? Cami? Honey? Come on, get up. Let me sleep, it's Sunday. Sunday? No! It's Monday already. You've been sleeping for more than a day. - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. I don't know how much you drank, but I hope you learned your lesson. Are you feeling okay? Or should I take you to the doctor? No. No to what? Shall we go to the doctor's? No, I'm fine. - Really? - Yes, I'm waking up. Okay, go take a shower. Your mom needs to leave soon, hurry up. Okay. Am I your favorite? Hey, are we still going on vacation? We are, but I don't know about you. Your grades say the opposite. Damn! I thought you were smart people, but your faith in our education system is blind. In my opinion, it's pretty mediocre. If you don't agree, you can move to... Finland. Deal. Will you pay my ticket? I know what, I'm going to drop my Anthropology major and become a TV actress. I have to go. And Camila? She won't have time for breakfast. Call an ambulance! Camila! What's wrong? Hello? We have an emergency. - Camila! - My daughter is unconscious! She's not breathing! - Easy, easy. - Camila... Dad, her hand. - What? - What happened? What's that? Hey, white boy. You're screwed. Give me everything you have. Hurry up! Didn't you hear me? Come on! Quickly! You think you're tough? Do it. What the fuck? We didn't find any cognitive damage from the fall. No virus or bacteria that may have caused the illness. In my opinion, this can all be related to the amount of alcohol she consumed. Also, we found traces of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, better known as ecstasy. I wanted to try it, I took one. Do you really think that could be the cause of her sleeping for two days straight, vomiting, or losing her balance? It could be, but it's not likely. - Depression? - I'm not depressed. It could be stress. In any case, we'll do additional tests for Camila. Take her home, she needs to rest. - Let's go. - I can do it myself. Okay. - Thank you. - Bye. Thank you. Cami... How are you? Are you feeling sick? What did the doctor say? Should I bring you some food? We can eat here in bed, like when we were kids. What? I didn't get that. I said no! Leave me the fuck alone! Camila, are you okay? Nothing. Come. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Get out. We can meet at my place next time, if you want. Don't come back. We won't see each other again. Camila? Camila? PRIEST, EXORCIST, MEXICO THERE ARE NO AUTHORIZED PRIESTS IN MEXICO CLANDESTINE EXORCIST PRIEST MEXICO I need to talk to you. And the door opened on its own, and she was on the other side of the room, sound asleep. Okay, I understand. No, no, you don't. That wasn't my sister! Look, I know this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Catholicism, but there was nobody else from any other religion willing to help me. Right. Hollywood movies are to blame for that. If you really want to help her, you should take her to see a doctor. We did take her to a doctor! He said there was nothing wrong with her. What is that book like? It's more of an ancient manuscript, it's in Latin. - Is it an ecclesiastic book? - No. It has symbols like the ones of the Necronomicon... - Necronomicon? - Yes. Are you sure? Yes, they're symbols very similar to Sumerian ones. It's like the Necronomicon. I know about this. Bring it over so I can see it. So, are you going to help my sister? If what you say is true, the first thing I need to do is figure out what we're up against. I need to see the manuscript, and your sister, of course. Okay, let's go. Wait, not so fast. This type of thing takes time. I need to study it closely. Are you an exorcist or not? Celtic, right? No, it's sacred geometry. It's my sister's. Camila. - Hi, Diego. - Hi. - Are you fucking a priest? - Cut the bullshit, this is important. I'm Tomás. - Diego. Nice to meet you. - Pleased to meet you, Diego. Should we sit down? Please. Camila, you know why I'm here, right? Have you been feeling unwell lately? Camila! It can be difficult to understand what's happening to you. You need help to get over this. And you're the help? - That's why I'm here. - I see. Do you see the evil in my face, wretched soul? Now, little human. What's your name? What's your name? What's your name, demon? What's your name, demon? Hi. What's going on? I'm Father Tomás. With all due respect, I wasn't talking to you. Cecilia. Okay, let me explain. - If you'd allow me, ma'am. - Doctor. De la Cueva. Dr. De La Cueva, we believe Camila has a serious problem. Sorry. Luis Miranda. If what you're saying is true, do you believe you're qualified to help her with her problem? Dad, give him a chance. Your daughter Fernanda came to see me with this. I'm working on it. I'm a philologist. This manuscript is the key to open doors that should remain closed. Without a doubt, it's one of a kind. And I see it was written with a specific reason. However, I'm certain that words written by the hands of a simple human, like you or me, can't affect physically the person who reads them. You wouldn't say that if you saw what we just saw. Yes? What did you see? Camila. Aren't you going to say anything? I don't know what's going on with you, Fernanda. Fernanda, what did you see? Her eyes became completely black, Dad! She started speaking in Latin! Excuse me, where are you going with that? Let me explain. I don't need any of your explanations. Okay. Dude, speak up! You also saw it! Tell them what you saw! Why aren't you talking? Say something! I'm not crazy! - Calm down. - All I want is for Camila to get better! Give me the manuscript and leave my house, or I'll call the police. Okay. Be careful, ma'am. Keep it away from Camila. Honey, we can talk to the doctor tomorrow and get the tests done early. Or we can get another specialist. Whatever you want, okay? The... Tomás? He had to go. Good night. We'll go to the doctor tomorrow, okay? You'll feel better once you get some rest... Really, Dad? Rest? Diego, do you need me to take you home? Or is someone picking you up? I'll get a cab. See you later, then. Be safe. Dad... Fernanda, we agreed, we'll get the tests done tomorrow, okay? And one more thing, please, don't touch my jigsaw puzzle. Father, what's up? Fine, child. - Are you feeling all right? - Yes. Thank you. I'll see you Sunday, then. Goodbye. We need to talk. Can you contact your provider? I've never felt like this before. In all my years of... There's something wrong, Tomás. I hope I won't have to use this soon. I need help, but not that yet. Does that book mean anything to you? I'm not sure, but I've seen it before. I don't know where. The person who read it... I think you should meet her. I can't expose myself now. I need to know what's going on with me. What's going on with you... I think it has something to do with that book, and that girl. That book... Where is it? I'll help you, but I need you to help me first. I can't take it anymore. Where is it? Karl, please. I can't take it anymore, help me. Help me, please! Where is it, you fucking addict? Karl... HOLY BIBLE Ythogtha! I'm sorry, Tomás. I'm sorry. Doctor? Yes, Camila? I can't do it, I don't feel good. Hold on a little longer, it's just a few seconds. Camila! Camila, are you okay? Camila! Camila! Camila! Breathe! Camila! I can't find any medical reason for what could be affecting Camila. Which is why I think it must be stress. Is that possible in someone so young? Well, yes. Given the circumstances, it's possible. - Do you feel stressed? - Yes, but that's not causing this! What's causing it, then? We need to talk to the priest. What for? You've already tried, I'm not possessed. I'm not saying you are, or that he needs to do an exorcism, but he said he knew someone who could help us. Camila, something bad is happening to you. It's no joke. Okay. I have an idea, wait for me. THE BOOK OF THE DEAD SPELL AGAINST THE ANCIENTS Are you okay? Calm down. What's your name? Karl. Everything will be all right, Karl. Don't worry. Karl. Karl. Karl! Are you all right? What are you doing here? Why do you look better? I hate it when you hide my medicine, but I also love you for it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. I hate to admit it, but you're the most important thing in my life. I hope you value what I just said, because I'll never say it again. Let's go. We need to help that girl. Why do you care about it so much? For the same reason you do. Besides, a father has to take care of the demons inside his own child. Are you going to leave me with my hand out? That's the house. What do you think you're here for? To save myself. Ythogtha. Where is she? - Is that him? - The only one that can save her. Don't you recognize me? Camila? Everyone, get out of the house. Now! Let's go. Let's go. I'll tell you something. This is the end... for Ythogtha. Cthylla. No, Fernanda. Why are they silent? What is he doing to her? Don't worry. Karl has done this many times before. Then why do you look so worried? - You again? - You can't go in. Where's Camila? She's with a friend of Tomás. Ma'am, it's dangerous. - Excuse me. - Please. Camila! What happened? If I were you, I wouldn't get so close to her. And who are you? Hang up. You can't come to my house, uninvited, and give me orders. I'm not playing. Me neither. Get out of my house! Fernanda, take Camila to her room. Careful. We'll leave, but before we do, there's something you need to hear. The fraternal bond that I have with Cthylla is only biological, so to speak. As I was never recognized by my father, he seeks to destroy... Your father? What on earth are you talking about? And what does that have to do with my daughter? Camila has been possessed by Cthylla... but her soul and destiny haven't bonded fully with that of the demon's. I can still save her, but we don't have much time. These forces predate humankind. It's difficult to understand them fully. Even when... Cami, no! Camila! - Camila! - No! Cecilia, don't! Karl, I'm waiting for your signal. Not now, Tomás! Ceci! Ceci! Cecilia! Cecilia! Mom? Take him out. And her sister? Leave her. No, no... Let's go. No, Cecilia... Cecilia... Camila. Come here. Goodbye, brother! Tomás, now! Now! Do it! Tomás, now! Tomás, please! It feels like it will never stop raining. Help me. I only have you. And I only have you. Everything will be all right. Dear Lord, through your only son, defeater of death, you have opened today the doors to eternal life. Allow those who celebrate the solemnity of the Lord's resurrection to resurrect also in the light of the eternal life by the renovating act of your spirit, through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you, in unity with the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I was waiting for you.
