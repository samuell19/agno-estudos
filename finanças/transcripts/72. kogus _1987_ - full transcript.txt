Our Germans f?nally entered Russian territory this morning. Germans are advancing under the command of General Hoffner. These Germans are very though. General Strauss is commanding the headquarters. Germans soldiers are advancing into Russians land the raiding all over communist Russians. Come on guys, we are going! We are ready, don't worry, just questions and answers. Germans are all over the place, captain, crushing and demolishing. What is their problem? Germans will destroy the entire world. Get lost scumbag! I really miss men. I miss them so much. Why are you laughing? Is that correct? Finish your work quickly! Why? Am I lying? Isn't that true? You are already dead! I'm gonna die yearning for some male smell. Look at our vulture, he is on the hunt for buttt again This bozo smells the right thing instantly. This bastard has become very tyrannic lately. I'm personally very upset about this He is an ass-kisser, so be it. Our captain can show him the day, and he'll sit down in his butt then. Nevermind... How are you early roosters? What is it to you? From now on, I'll f?ght for my own food. They won't let you to eat it. But you borrowed gambling money from him? And you lost that money easily. You did the same shit, so? That's true If you want we can set up a nice round, maybe in your ward... ...or maybe in our ward. Attention please! Your principal is speaking. Your brake is over Please get back to your wards. Shortly I'll be briefing you with detailed news about the II. World War. Yes, my principal! Yes, sir. Luxurious cigarette! Come on it, brothers, I've brought some food for you! I swear I'm gonna kill this bozo one day. Hello the ward of billionaires! Gather around big guys! Here you are. Thanks... Here you are, say your prayers for the government.

Nice, Hasan, come with me. You go on. - Be quick. - Yes sir. Uncle Sabri is here, so give back the bread you took. Same shit every day! See, look at the captain, he is not complaining. You were doing everything just to get some money from Uncle Sabri! So give back the food! What can we do, we have to give the breads back. Brother Kemal, still you are at work to save the our government. Bite it carefully, your teeth might fall off. - Shut up... - I'm just joking brother Kemal. Son, don't mind this bastard. My arm is broken! Don't be a thief! Finders keepers! Give it to me! But I grabbed it. Shut up! Please captain, help me out He acts like the king of the ward. What so, if he is powerful. Elephant is mightier than the camel! If the captain wants, you will pay for it. They say, he beat the shit out of 5 men. Just knock him over, captain He is just a bear... a solid one... I wish I had his body posture. Come, come, ladies are in the courtyard! Look at Fatma no, no look at the other one Nevermind her. Look at Fatma Get your hands off me! Oh my God, look at these chicks. What are you doing, be careful! Voice of Ankara is reporting. News from the battle-front. German troops are still advancing through Russian lands and they have captured the city of Minks. Germans are taking many prisoners from Russians. Maybe only Germans can save us from here. I wish they came all the way here... ...and open the prison doors and let us out. Mind your words, you will see what kind of shame is that to live under German flag. Brother Kemal knows these stuff, he used to tell me about it all. On the other Hand, German troops led by General Von Brushner... ...has forced Russians to retreat after they passed through Karpatian mountains. Von Brushner and his forces have also capture the city of Prutt. Why should we care about Germans, anyway? You are right, we should mind our own business. You wanna bet on 100 lira? Meanwhile Allied forces are attacking against German forces. Anybody wanna play? See all these butts, they are for real! See, I'm lucky, I wish I'm this much lucky all the time. See, the dice is five-three... Young women is preferred is she is teen That's not the way to say that... here we go... Young women is preferred is she is fresh I won't play with you... Why is that? Because you always cheat, even if you lose. No I'm honest. As long as you don't trick with the dice, I'm ok for anything. Come on, come on... I'll play honest. Come on, come on... I'll play honest. Do you promise? Yes I do! Yes, yes play with him. Here we go! I won! See my wrist, I won with my wrist. Give me my buttts back... I won! You promised! God will punish you! This is not fair! You shouldn't have played if you are not honest Shut up, so be it, come and take if you dare! Take them all if you dare! Come on! Take it if you dare! What about you? I respect you all the time, you know me. Why do you hit me? Elephant is bigger than the camel! Show me that elephant? Where is he? I'm the king of this ward, Mark my words! Captain! Those are my goods! Go for it captain! Don't! Stop! So you said you were the king of this ward. Please captain, stop! Please captain, I'm dishonored now among these bozos See, every Ramses has one Moses. - What's up? - Berbat is calling you! - Who the hell is he? - Mind your manners. What is he doing here? Why can't you have discipline in this ward? - Come over here. - Please sir, excuse me... - Call me the captain! - Yes sir. Captain, come quickly, they want you from the off?ce. Why do they want me? I have no idea why? Who is the rat here? I don't know for sure captain! If you know and not telling me? I swear I don't know... He just told me to call you. Follow me. Tell the chief that captain is here. Just wait, he'll be here. He regards himself someone important, just a bozo... Come over here. Somebody ratted over me? What rat? Excuse me, I made one mistake. Captain, do you have any relatives back in Rize? Rize? No, I don't have any relatives there. Who is Hatice Kalender? She is my mother. She sent you 150 lira. My poor mother! Come to the office, we'll give you your money. Oh my Good, Captain has become rich! We are going to talk with the principal for the money her mother sent him. Welcome in. Your mother has sent you money. God bless her. 150 Lira, That's too much money. I'll give 50, and keep the 100 lira. Anyway, this 50 lira will keep you well for the whole year Sign here, or with your thumb-stick. Guard yourself good, captain, do you hear me, guard yourself. For what reason? Those who talked from your back, now smell money and smile back at you. Protect your money! This is bother-hood money. What are you talking about, when you were starving, who shared his food with you? Listen to me, let's buy a pan, we'll cook our own food. Then we'll light up our own cigarettes and I'll serve you, my king! I'll wash your dishes and clothes. Tell the chief, you'll get transferred to the ward of masters, since now, you're one of the master. You have money now! You are now king, blessed news for you captain! Was it your mum, sent you money? Yes her mum sent it, God bless her! Did you take the money? So will you order some food, with some meat inside? If I were you, I'll buy some cigarettes. Blessed news, captain. Thank you... The dominant philosophy in the country influences citizens badly. The government is so corrupt to make favors only for the rich. Government off?cers only to work in whispers when they smell money. For these privileges, citizens are only asked for absolute respect for the authority for the chiefs. What is this got to do with being a good citizen? Didn't you like it? I didn't like it at all. You are talking about a class-less society as if it exist. What about the class clash? Don't laugh, it makes me nervous. Now latest news from the batttle front Chief, turn up the speakers, let everyone hear about our Germans. 100.000 Russian soldiers has been takes prisoners by the German forces. So that everyone will see how the Germans dominate the Europe. Yes Sir! See, Hitler is raiding all over, crushing everything in front. And they put us into this rat-hole just because I wrote a poem. Anyway, I'm glad capitalism is doomed. Don't be selfish... tens of thousands people are dying. Humanity won't progress by dying simply. Mr. Kemal, air-break. For only a while, get back if Chief comes here. Thanks. Why is he so sullen? - He is a rookie around here, leave him alone. - As you say... Never stopped talking, all raving about Germans. Our principal is like this, when he wants he turns up the speakers. I'm not a rookie! Never a ignorant or stupid! You are rottten here, barely can stand up! The world is changing, you have no idea. So you are clever and wise, ha? So you can stand up, ha? So you will change the entire world on your own, ha? So without comrades, without an organization, with your courage, love and rage... ...will you change everything, ha? You will end wars and slavery, ha? Mr. Kemal? We have smoked your cigarettes for a long time, now please smoke ours. And let me light it for you! Now please smoke ours, this time. However, we request something. He is a rookie, he doesn't know what it takes to be a prisoner. We were like him once upon a time. We were like him once upon a time. Son, are we ok? We are ok. So let's get back to our cell. The chief will jump on us any minute. Why did you release them? For air - brake. They don't need air. They should be executed anyway. Captain, take care of these folks. No fighting! Chief, do you know the news, Captain is rich now! Why should I care for someone else's money? Enjoy spending it. Hopefully I'll enjoy. We'll turn this ward into a heaven. I'm asking you, is it ok for 15 lira? Yes. So let's shake hands. Captain Hasan, we now have bunk-beds, blanket! Hey, Captain is calling you! Yes sir. I'll put this bunk-bed, in your corner. Put this bunk-bed in that corner, that's not his own place. I'm my king's personal assistant! Why did you throw my bed? Has humanity come to an end? I'll spare my soul for my captain? Everyone has their own dignity! Don't be arrogant! Help us out! Hold this carefully! You are a great man! Don't fuss much about it! Please captain, they'll get used to collect money from you. They are greedy... be careful Nevermind, I told you. Here you are captain, your bed is ready. What's up? I'm thinking of buying a grill, tea-pot, and pans... Come on here! So? Cruise the wards, f?nd a good grill, pot and a pan. Come back to us to inform and we'll but it. Really? What'd you say captain? Do what he tells you. Don't trust these punks. Whatever is in your mind, tell me... ...I'll do my best for you. I'll make tea, cook some food... for everyone, free of charge. And then? Nothing, for everyone, free of charge. Since this is brother-hood, it will be free! Let me kiss your hand, captain! But what shall we cook? Beans! As you say captain, give me the money. Come on here hen-man, go to the market... ...buy some beans and 250 gr of meat... No, make the meat half-kilo. Onions? What about onions? Salt also, please! What about tomato paste? There is no taste without paste! You all forgot about red pepper. Shut up! Enough, is this a restaurant? Come on! Clear the way! Blessed news, captain! This whole thing suits for a king. Also gambling suits the king, you wanna bet captain? As you wish. If you want your laundry done, Bobi will be at your service captain. I see, if I need so... What's up! What's going on? What's wrong with him? Take him to the clinic! Come one, hold carefully! He has some spasm. Take him to the clinic. Slowly... don't be afraid. Ahhh... I'm dying... Which part of your body? Here... here... it hurts... so much... Here... or here? Yes... yes... it hurts... You are all rotten inside... leave me alone with him... Doctor, am I going to die? I don't know... we'll see. Hello, everyone. Welcome! Whom are you visiting to? To the captain. I told the captain that you are visiting him an important man, I told him... He was nervous... I swear... the big captain he was really anxious. Let's get rolling... let's not make the captain wait. Where is the captain? I'll inform him that he has visitors. I'm his assistant, I'll do the informing. What ever you do, don't mess thing up. My greetings, Mr. Kemal. Thank you, son. Solozlo is visiting you. That's an honor for me. The joy of being a king comes from gambling, right? Captain, knows the best. Since we are his visitors. Let's play captain, maybe we'll be lucky. Let's not rush things. Maybe next time, when you'll visit us... Maybe... now let us offer you some tea... we just made it. Leave the pan... leave it for me... No, you leave it for me... You are an animal! ...No you are the animal! Here you are, two packs of cigarettes. I'll give it to him... No I'll give it to him... Fill the cups... Shall I do that captain? May I f?ll them captain? We need new clothes, new trousers. And we have to shave ourselves. So they won't say captain's men are smelling like a goat. Go for it, Captain! This prison has never seen a king like you. We also need a heater, not the freeze our asses off. That's very true! Heater is the most important. Berbat! Tell the chief that we need a heater. Why not me? I'm your assistant, I'll but it for you. Shut up, no fuss! Go together with him. Chief, these folks need to set up a heater, with captains money... ...can you inform the principal. Why are you laughing chief? You really think, you'll set up heater in your ward? Anyway, come with me... You wait here, look at your clothes. Am I not human being? Knock it off. He's right, If you visit the principal like this he'd pass out because of your smell. So you want to buy a heater, ha? Yes. Who's paying for it? Captain. Does this captain keeps his money on you? Yes, we are friends? Yes I see. Give the money to the chief, he'll buy it for you. Thank you. I love this smell of beans. I see you're lucky... What are you cooking? Beans? Yes, beans. Pray for the captain. How are you my king? Anything you wish? No, he doesn't have any wish. We were sick of eating smelling old chicken and olive seeds. God Bless our king! Gambling is the best. If I had captain's money... I'd give half of it back to him and gamble with him. Good that our captain is not insane. Am I insane? I didn't say that. Hello, friends. How are you bobi? So you are cooking beans today also? Hello, captain. So I took your clothes to the women's sector. You know there's this beauty, Fatma there. I told her that these are captain's clothes Told her to wash them good and iron them... I told her about you also... Really? What did she say? I told her about your felony. She was impressed very much... She told me I'd give my soul to captain Did you tell her that I was a real captain, that I traveled France, Russia and everywhere... I told her everything. I told her that this man is not like other prisoners. I told her to wash your clothes neatly... She said that she'd be honored to do so... So she heard about my fame. Anybody here left not to hear your fame? Everybody knows you... you are great captain! The beautiful Fatma even didn't ask for money. Why is that? I told you already, she said she'd be honored. This chick is real for sure. She would do this favor for everyone. Captain is different. Money is not important but a small gift would be nice. One for me, and one for Fatma. No, take this ten. Wow! Ten? Go for it, captain! He knows the trick! We'll play a bit, Hasan Don't worry, you'll have your cut. Ok then... Thanks... Oh, here comes the captain's gang! What's up? The captain needs some new clothes. So I see, he enjoys spending money. He's our king, he'll buy us some new clothes. First we have to dress him up. Don't forget about me. We know it, be patient. Wait for it. This Bobi will have his cut in again. I took these from the navy guy. It is at least 10 lira. Our captain will be like a Sultan if he wear them. What about me? Come on in, we'll have something for you also. I hope I'll have some new clothes one day. Splendid... You look wonderful my king! Don't fuss about it much... Let's drink some tea. I'm filling them up, right my king? Yes yes, do it so! May I? Yes, jack-ass, do it so! Ok, I'm f?lling them up. He is our captain. Both in the sea and in the land. Captain please tell us your felony. We want to hear it again. Say it again. Captain please tell us your felony. We want to learn it again. I was in Istanbul, I was busy with work. I was hanging around in Galata and had a friend in Beyo?lu. And another friend in Riba. And I had so much money. I couldn't go back to my home town because of vendetta. I was hungry for their blood, They were hungry for my blood. So they made me kill her, I just shot her... for no logical reason You don't know about these stuff. What then captain? Shut up! And then what happened captain? And then... nothing... it doesn't exist. Where you going captain? To the toilet. Hello captain. Hello bobi. Your clothes captain... she ironed them as well... they smell very nice... Did you give her gift? Of course I did. Her eyes glared when she saw the money. She saw you lately, when she was cleaning the windows of the principal's office... When you were walking in the garden... She said, I'll give my soul to captain If you are lying, I'll pierce your eyes. I swear that's true. Come on bobi, we have things to do. Kayali! Come over here! Here take them! Are these my king's stuff? Did Fatma wash these stuff? Yes... yes... take them in. So you are lucky with seven lives, we already thought you were dead. Mind your words. Welcome captain. Address him as your king. So we brought you some cigarettes. Give him! Shall I give him the whole package? Yes. Enjoy smoking it... And take this money. I told the watch-men You'll pay them and you'll eat whatever you want. Thank you captain. I wanted to have a children, it didn't matter whether it was a boy or not... As long as I have my own baby... I really don't care... Hello girls! You know what Bobi... lf Ayten would let us... I know what I would do... Back off... Did you wash captain's clothes? They are ready, I'll give it to you. I love your fat cheeks. Get off! Well done lady! Now we'll get 10 lira. Why don't you give some money to Ayten so that she would let us alone, with you and me! If this chick captures me alone I wonder what she would do to me... Solozolu is earning some much money in gambling but he doesn't give anybody any food. Our king would share more food if he earned more money from gambling... Welcome back... Hello, how are you? Welcome in brother! All passed away now... God Bless you... We thought you went to the other side. Are you still alive? My king should not see you like this... he would be upset. Why don't you see? See what? Wow! You have new clothes. Was it the Germans who sent you these clothes? No it is our king! Our captain! Welcome back! How are you... I like this guy... This is my personal assistant... He spared you some new clothes... And you will have to shave also. You have to look handsome. Thank you captain! Address him My king Let me kiss you hand my king! Follow me! Captain, did you forget about me?

His... Really? I swear. I hope we will win some money. If you win, what will you buy for me? Pray first that we'll win. It is easy after that. Why are you touching my shoulders? I want some smoke. Don't forget about this. So what? One day I'll have some money. You hen-thief! Where can you have some money from? The world is round, who knows? Captain never thought about this before. Take this all. Spare them for your friends. If were lucky, nobody can stop us captain! My Dear... After I heard your reputation, I can't wait for you, spare my soul for you... If you love me, I'll be blessed. I'm kissing and smelling your clothes in lieu of you. Come, principal wants you. I'm giving you the rest of you money. I'm warning you, you are spending your money carelessly. Your thumb-stick here... This is brother-hood money, that's why I share. Women here suggest that we should be sure of Captain's love... ...for you so that he'll send you 100 lira. But I didn't believe them, for your information. That's a set-up! I swear that's a set-up. Captain is not a kid, he would understand that it's a set-up. He is a clever man like no others! I say, she is a great woman and she loves you! I love this type of astute woman. Solozlu is coming... ...greet them. Welcome everyone! You brought good blessings! Make it short. Welcome! Hello Captain! Please, have a seat. Thanks. What would you like to drink? Tea or coffee? We've been drinking tea and coffee since the morning so please let's not give you trouble. What kind of trouble? Let's drink some tea of friendship. We appreciate your friendship.
