How will you do that? I’ll stay here in Posadas, I’m not going back to Buenos Aires. -For how long? -I don’t know, as long as it takes. -Are you serious? -Yes. Why didn’t you tell me before? Look what happened! Why would I tell you? I’d have had time to change the situation. There isn’t one, nothing needs changing. I’m telling you my plans. -Let me have my say. -Go ahead. I think it’s total madness. What can I say? -You’re not 17 anymore? -No. That’s what I mean, love. You’re too old for all that. You’ve nearly got your PhD. You’ve been working and studying for years. You’re an amazing student, you’re brilliant, a top notch lawyer. And you’re about to get your PhD, a PhD you persevered with for months. Or am I wrong? And it’s costing you a fortune. -Are you serious? -Of course. A top-notch lawyer? I started the PhD one year ago. I work doing shifts at court. You’re giving up your studies to become a rural teacher. A rural teacher. Great. Your communist friends would be proud. Stop being stupid, Paulina. Go back to Buenos Aires, go back to studying and your job. I can’t believe this. You of all people talking like this. Don’t play the “conservative dad” card. Listen to yourself! Who do you think I am? I did all the fieldwork already, and much more, as you know. You of all people should know that. That’s why I’m telling you that if you want to change things, you must work in the judiciary, work your way to the top, then you can make decisions, and deal out justice appropriately. I don’t want a career in the judiciary, I don’t want to be a judge. If you think I’m organizing a guerrilla game in the jungle, then you’ve really lost the plot. -Convince me then. -What? Convince me. Show me you’re right. That this is important, not some romantic hippie fantasy. Romantic hippie fantasy? -You think it’s funny? -Not at all. I’m an amazing student with a unique future, but only when I do what you want. Sometimes you talk to me like a 12-year-old kid. I’m sick of it, I’ve had enough. Your dogmatism, your authoritarianism. You’re progressive when it suits you but take a look at yourself. Look how you react and who your friends are. One word out of your comfort zone and you behave like a reactionary. You know I’ve been working on the project for years. You worked on it too. You always thought it was great, you were cynical, as usual, but you supported it. We did it, it’s going ahead. I want to be there. I want to work there. I’m abandoning a successful career in the justice system, yes. And a PhD I’ve been slogging away at. But why? For a project that means far more to me then the judicial studies you’re so proud of. Because I want to fight for it. You say I’m an amazing lawyer. What does that matter if I can’t change anyone’s life? Maybe you’re right and I am a naïve kid, but I’d rather mess things up now and lose two years than be cynical and bitter in ten years time. Fantastic. Fantastic. Bitter… cynical… and conservative. Wonderful. You’ve won me over. You are right. You’re right. I’m going to give it all up, I’ll go to El Impenetrable, in Formosa, teach the Tobas Indians to read, then I’ll be a hero. Don’t be childish, dad. Do you know what? If I go… Bellocq will have the zone crawling with military in less than a week. In one month he will have deported every beneficiary of this great project. Fight for it. Come on, love, do you really think I don’t? That what I do doesn’t change lives? Answer me! Don’t I change anyone’s life? You’re not going to answer? Don’t be silly. Do I change lives or not, yes or no? -Yes, everyone’s. -Great. So don’t pretend. You know you’re overqualified for this. If you want to change a life, do what you have to do. You could be manager of this project. What you want to do any 20-year-old could do… a second-year student. It’s great you want to be part of the project, but at the appropriate level… that reflects your experience, your professional rank, your intellectual capacity. What would happen if I were the head of the project? Do you see why I can’t do that? Because I’m your daughter. How long would the project last if they realized you were involved? Be grateful Rudy’s there and can make it work. And what is this mad enlightened idea? It’s snobby and elitist. You can’t accept an educated, middle-class woman working in the slums. Would you mind if a poor woman took a management job? -When did you become racist? -You’ve gone too far, Paulina. -Perhaps I did. -You did. I don’t think you’re racist. Thank you. But you are a bit of a snob. And elitist. If you say so. Listen to me. Listen, I’m serious. It’s not a whim, I’m talking politics. I know I could do much more than this. But the program’s very important, it’s the first year. It’s got to work. It could be a model for the entire province. I want to fight for it. I think someone like me should be there to fight for it. From the inside, on site, being a part of it. To fight for it I need to be there… starting from the bottom, giving classes, as you said, as a rural teacher. What? Nothing, it’s okay. Tell me. Why are you telling me all this? I don’t know, we’re talking. -You want my approval? -No. -My permission? -No way. If I say no, you’ll do it anyway. Yes, of course. Well then? What? Nothing. Let’s go eat. -Fernando… -To eat. No, but don’t worry, I’m leaving. -Have you spoken to him yet? -To who? Have you or haven’t you? -A little. -What does he think? He thinks it’s good. I bet! -I left my things at your house. -Okay. I’ll stay until I find a place to rent. As long as you want. Are you ready? Yes. Do you mind if I record you? Not at all. Where should I start? From wherever you think best. From the beginning, I suppose. So, he didn’t agree. He said not but I think deep down he did. And your boyfriend? -What? -What did he think? It was harder for him. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Incarnation Carnival. The Carnival of Paraguay! -Wait. -A little bit. Just a little. Now. Do what you want, but stay near me. You think I came back for you? No. Yes, you do. No. -A little. -I like to think a little bit true. -Just a little. -How little? -Very little. -Little or very little? -Very little. -That’ll do. Some of you know her. This is Paulina. Hello. Paulina is joining the rights and democracy program. I’m very happy we’re finally starting. I’ve looked at the documents and made some changes. -They’re statistics… -Hand them out. -Did you check the forms? -Pass this around. Come and say hello. Turn it off, Milton. -I don’t want to! -Why not? Not till the song ends. Come on, let’s go. Let’s go. Listen for a minute, sitting down. Remember me, kids? Nobody remembers my name? Nobody. Nobody remembers. You don’t give a damn, do you? -You’re Rudy. -Ah, that’s better. This is your teacher, Paulina. She will be teaching the politics and rights program. It’s important you attend, don’t skip the workshop. If you have any questions… you can ask the teacher. Over to you now, teacher. Bye, kids. You were late. So, as Rudy said, my name is Paulina, I’ll be taking over this term. Can anyone guess what the workshop is about? You must all think it’s about politicians, when people talk of politics, we think of politicians. Can you tell me what politics means for those of us who aren’t politicians? Who knows which political system we live in? Nobody? No idea? No idea. What if I say we live in a monarchy, am I right? Is there a king in Argentina? Do we have a monarchy? Can someone open their mouth? Is there a king in Argentina? Do we live in a monarchy? -No. -No. So? It’s a democracy. Democracy, well done. And do you know what that means? It means the government belongs to the people. It doesn’t belong to the politicians, it’s yours. The politicians work for you. They’re your employees, not vice versa. They’re your employees. Hard to believe, but it’s a fact. Here in this classroom, for instance… who has the power, you or I? You have the power, teacher. No, you’re wrong. I work for you. I’m your employee, I’m here to teach you. If you want me to go, I go. If you want to go, you go. So if I want to go, I can? You won’t try to stop me? I’m here to teach, if you want to go, that’s your loss. So I can go? We can all go? I can’t force you to stay, I will still teach. They all left? A few stayed, but yes, it was a disaster. But you didn’t give up. No, never. Not even when defeated. Today we’ll play a game. Let’s imagine we’re imprisoned here, for one month. We’re all together, and we can’t leave. Let’s imagine this. We’re shut away in here. We have just enough food and water. What’s the first thing we have to do? I’d call my mom. Think about it kids, what’s the first thing to do? I’d try to leave. You can’t leave. You have to stay here, that’s the game. The first thing is to agree on a few rules. Why can’t I leave? It’s the rule of the game. What’s interesting is how we set the rules together. How we agree on the rules. And who says we can’t leave? The game. That’s the game. The rule of the game. So you set the rules, not everyone. No. No, no. I set the rule so the game exists. We’re all equal in the game. We’re not equal if you set the rules. You set the rules. What did you say? What does that mean? Can someone translate? You set the rules because you’re “caté.” Is that what you think? That I’m “caté” and that’s why I’m here to set rules? Solano! Let go of him! Get out! Let him go! Enough! I said. Thanks. Got any? No, but have this. The big kid’s uncle… slashed Solano’s dad’s face, years ago. They’re animals. Always fighting. They’re calmer now. I canceled your class. The last one was canceled too. I heard. Come. Come on. Come with me. Why are you lot still here? You didn’t go to your mom’s in Paraguay? A friend came, he had to stay. Enough! Have you eaten? We made a soup. Know what your problem is? -You’re scared of them. -What? I’m not. Worse still, you pity them. Do you like being pitied? If you pity them, they will make your life hell. They will end up hating you and you’ll hate them too. Stand up to them. Win them over. Cheers! I met him when I was about 15. He went to the school around the corner. I thought he was gorgeous, he had a motorbike, he was hot. I fell for him bad. We’ve been together ever since. -And how’s it going now? -Badly. We moved to Buenos Aires, but he hated it and came back. -He came back? -Yes. He’s so pathetic in some ways. When he talks politics, you want to kill him. I swear, it’s awful. I don’t know if it’s love or punishment. -What about you? -What about me? No, nobody. Closest thing I have are those little kids. What about at the school, nothing? Shall we open another one? What time is it? It must be late. It’s really late, Laura. I’ll start the motorbike and we’ll go. No, let’s call a taxi. No taxi will come here at this time. Are you sure? Wait! Are you in a state to drive? Yes, I’ll get on the bike, the wind will sober me up. You sure you’re up for it? Bring it back tomorrow, you know how to drive? There’s the starter. I’ll go to school tomorrow, but it’s only 30 minutes on foot. Take it. Your boyfriend can return it… I’ll recognize him in a motorbike. Thanks. I’ll bring it back tomorrow. Ciao. -Hi, Brian. -Hi. -Is your mom home? -Yes. Call her. Tell her Ciro’s here. Hi. Come in. It’s not you, Ciro. I liked being with you. I don’t have a problem with you. But I told you what I like. I like having fun. I like being independent. You’re different. So that’s that. It’s okay… but I don’t want either of us to suffer. So the best thing is for us to stop now… and get on with our own lives. You want something else, Ciro. You told me how you like your girls and I’m not like that. I like going out, having fun. That’s all. Is there someone else? That’s got nothing to do with it. Is there or not? Yes, I’m starting to see someone. Who is it? It doesn’t matter. Who is it? You don’t know him, he’s not from here. Where’s he from? He’s Brazilian. Look, Ciro, your girlfriend’s coming. My love! -Vivi, my life! -Come here! -I want to marry you! -I love you! I want you to meet a friend. Stop here! Blow me a kiss. Look at Ciro. Sorry if we insulted your girl. But she’s so cute. You don’t give a damn, do you? -You’re Rudy. -That’s better. This is your teacher, Paulina. She’ll be teaching the politics workshop. It’s important you attend, don’t skip the workshop, even if you don’t want to come. If you have any questions you can ask the teacher. Over to you now, miss. Bye, kids. Behave yourselves. You were late. So, as Rudy said, my name is Paulina, I’ll be taking over this term. What’s the first thing we have to do? The first thing I’d do is try to leave. No, you can’t leave. You have to stay here, we’re shut in. What I mean is the first thing to do is set a few rules. Who says we can’t leave? Come quick. -What’s going on? -Be quiet. What’s going on? -Shut up for it they’ll hear you. -Who? It’s better than porn. Got your phone? Yes, what for? Give it to me. Come on, man. Be quiet or they’ll hear you. I’m going too. Take a picture. Hot bitch! Vivi’s hot. -Make a video. -I will. What a pretty girl you have. I’m jealous of you. Vivi, my love. Beat it! Beat it! There he is, Ciro. We’ll be the shit out of him. When he’s alone we’ll beat his Brazilian ass. Come on, Ciro. Fucking Brazilian. Get up, Ciro. Come on, move it, man! What’s up with you? Get up. You looking for a fight, Sandro? You wanna fight? No, it’s cool, Ciro. It’s okay. You wanna fight or not? No, it’s cool, Ciro. -Hey. Ciro. -Ciro. What’s going on, kids? What are you doing? -Get out of here! -Come here. Ciro, come here. What’s going on? What’s your problem? There’s Vivi. There she is. Let’s go. Let’s go… Go get her. You get her, she’s your girl. Weren’t you jealous of me? Didn’t you wanna fuck my girl? Go get her and fuck her. Like I fucked your sister. What’s your fucking problem? I’m gonna break her ass. I wanna see. Come on! Bring her anyway. No! No! Go on. Go on. Get off, you son of a bitch! You can’t even get this right. Leave her, it’s over, let’s go. Shut up! Come on, leave her. That’s right, man, leave her. Come on, let’s go. Let’s go, come on. Paulina. Hey? I’m asking if you want to stop. I mean… Before we continue with what happened that night… The rape? No need, that’s why I came here. As you wish. Some people find it hard to talk when it comes to this part. Not me. I’d like to take a break. Do you mind if I smoke? Can you smoke here? If you don’t mind, then yes. No, go ahead and smoke. Why didn’t you run when they stopped you? I don’t know… I thought they needed help, then it was too late, too many of them. What time was it? I don’t remember but… Around 11:00, perhaps later. We’ll say it was the early hours. Do you know your attackers’ names? No, if I did I’d have told you. Had you seen them before? No, I don’t think so. It was dark, they covered my head, I saw nothing. Might you have seen them before? No. No. What were you wearing? -What? -What clothes were you wearing? A T-shirt, trousers, a pair of sneakers. Could you describe your clothes? A red short-sleeved top, loose trousers. Nothing sexual or provocative if that’s what you mean. Sorry, I have to ask for the report. Have you drunk any alcohol? Me? Yes. What? Wine, at my friend’s house. How much? A fair amount. Were you drunk? A little. Drugs? That’s enough! Leave it at that. We’re done here. -I’m following procedure. -That’s fine, it’s over now. Bruising in the vaginal area. A small hemorrhage. Perineal bruising. There we go. We’ll do the swab. Pass me the speculum. Bottom up, please. That’s it. Lift your legs a little. -Like that? -That’s it. That’s it, lift it up. This will hurt a little. Keep breathing deep. Relax, don’t get tense. These are the painkillers and the sedatives. Take them every 12 hours or when you feel the need. These are the most important ones, the antiretroviral drugs. They may make you feel bad, nauseous, but whatever you do, don’t stop the treatment. -Yes? -Yes. Thank you. This is a delicate matter but I have to ask you… It’s okay. Was the penetration via normal… Vaginal. Your wounds, are they all in the reports, or are there others? No, the medical examiner put them all… in the file. I must also ask you this, did you do any STD tests? Yes, they did all of them. The rape kit? All of them. Okay. You are the one who must do the talking. You still have marks here… and here. This is where I start to not understand. What? What’s going on with you? I had to carry on. The way you chose to do so was strange. I haven’t had many cases like yours. So? What are you getting at? I wonder what you were looking for. -Good morning. -Good morning. Are you going out? Yes, I’m going to work. Work? At the school. I told them I was going back. Who, Rudy? The project’s office, I can’t keep missing work. I’m not sure it’s a good idea, it’s a bit soon. And it could be dangerous. Why dangerous? I’m scared that you’re moving too fast. These things take time. I don’t know if you’re ready. I am, I feel fine. How much longer must I shirk by responsibilities? Don’t worry, I’m really okay. They’re waiting for me. I’m starting in three minutes. Go to class, girls. Let’s go. Hand these out. Read the handouts. Do you know what it is? The Constitution? No. Juan Francisco, you read it, please. “All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.” Very good. Now can you tell me what it is? The Criminal Code? No, it’s not the Criminal Code. It’s the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The rights we all have, for being born on this planet. For existing and belonging to the human race. For the rest of the workshop you’ll write an essay, twenty to thirty lines about what your article means to you. Okay, kids. Silvana, you read it. The part I got is about slavery. It says: “No man can be another’s slave, because all men are equal.” In the past, white men felt superior. They thought all other races were like animals and that they had the right to use them as we use dogs and horses today. They also thought that all other races belonged to them. Nowadays, many men still believe that others belong to them. We want local ministers, social security, banks, etc., to be present here, once a month. For consultation prior to your appointment. There’ll be stands in the school yard for the whole week. We’ll see you from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. It’s important to come on Monday, so as to finish the papers during the rest of the week. Any questions? For the identity cards, should we bring our kids? First come alone, we take details, and give a slot for the same week. Then you come with the kids, we take their photos and they sign. Okay, things to bear in mind, on Monday, slots are allocated for the same week. Is that clear? I was talking to a friend. He works in private security. They know people there who can start to check. Check? Yes, check, take action. Check what? Who they were, Paulina. -I know who they were. -What? I think I know who they were. Some kids from the school. Are you serious? I’m not sure, but I think it was them. How long have you suspected? Since I went back to the school. Why didn’t you tell me? Do you know their names? I don’t want you to get involved, okay? Paulina are you crazy? -You go there knowing… -Calm down. Did you tell your dad? Not until I’m sure. I’m handling it myself. You’re mad to go back there… I go there to work, the boys are another matter. You went back 2 weeks ago, saw the pigs who raped you -and did nothing? -Calm down. No, we’ll go report them to the police. -We’ll tell your dad. -No, stay out of my affairs. Your affairs? You’re driving me crazy! Let me do this my way. Your way? Teaching the bastards who raped you, that’s your way? Pauli. What’s wrong? Nothing, leave me alone. -Pauli. Are you okay? -Yes. -Stop, Pauli. -Leave me, I’m fine. Did you know? I suspected. -How long? -A few days, a week. You’re sure it’s not mine? Yes, quite sure, aren’t you? I’d like you to do a test to be sure. A test? A DNA test, Paulina. All you care about is if you’re the dad. You don’t think it matters? I think it’s awful. -You make me feel awful. -What? You’re making me feel awful. I never saw him again. Everything okay? He left the province, perhaps for Paraguay. My darling. Everything will be all right. I promise you. Do you miss him? No, not at all. These bloody trees… How can they be such bastards? Can you believe it? 700 hectares of this rubbish. For what? With the mate plants we had a bit of skyline. Now these bloody forestry guys come… they fuck up the earth… destroy everything, the rain-forest, the wild life, this fills up with dead leaves that get everywhere… and they make a killing. Can you imagine… when the rain-forest came right to here? Yes, I remember. How could you remember? You were just a wee thing. You can’t remember. It did me good. I got some rest. I spoke a lot with my aunt, too. Can I ask what you spoke about? Hmm? What did you speak about? Everything, nothing. Look at this one… isn’t it incredible? -It’s a bird! -I love it. I don’t understand the question. I wanted to know if you’d spoken of the matter. You’re mom was a real character. She’d say she was the good one, I was the bad one. Lies. She was a cow. Do you remember her at all? Nothing. A little, vaguely. She must be an angel in your memory. -A heavenly apparition. -Something like that. Nothing’s changed. The queen of kindness. You don’t know what she was like! A little devil. I’ll give you an example. Every time I liked a guy, she did all she could to get in there first. And she succeeded, she was popular. When we were older and lived together… she shut herself away with guys and made so much noise… you couldn’t hear yourself think. Do you think she was having fun? No way! It was all an act, she was a bitch. Will you stay here a few more days? I don’t think so. I want to go back to the school. Victoria is going to Buenos Aires for a competition. -Did you say hi? -I didn’t see her. Perhaps she’s avoiding me. Don’t be paranoid, she’ll be with the orchids. I’m glad not to see her grumpy face. She was good to me, I like talking to her. -She calmed my mind. -She twisted your mind. That too. My baby. I wanted to say… You should carry on doing what you want. I think this break is a good thing. If you want to carry on at the school… I understand, for now. But I want you to know it’s all arranged. Of course I want it to be your decision, the time, the place, the way… I want to help you as best I can. I talked to your gynecologist. Don’t worry, everything’s organized. So, when you’re ready… Dad, I’ve been thinking hard… -What’s wrong? -Are you mad? -Calm down, Fernando. -No! You’ve fucked up! -Let me speak. -No. What is there to say? It’s madness! Why put that in her head? It’s nothing to do with me. It’s her. She wants to have it. Her mind is made up. -She’s mad. -But it’s what she wants. Let’s wait… Let’s wait. We mustn’t put pressure on her now. How are you? Good. What are those things for? I came to fetch them. I’ll be at Laura’s. It’s for the best. There? Yes, it’ll be easier for me. Do you need any help? Want a lift? No, I’m not taking much now, I’ll get more next week. Good. Right, I’m off. You can reach me on my cell phone. -Hi! -Hi. I didn’t hear you come in. I cleared space for you there. Thank you. -Want a bite to eat? -Yes, I’m starving. Come. Vivi! Can you hold it? Are you there, Vivi? Vivi? Brian! -Vivi? -Hi. Hi, gorgeous. This is Paulina… Vivi. Vivi… Paulina. Brian, come here. Come in. Come inside. Laura told me you’re pregnant, miss. Speak to me informally. Yes, I am. How long? About one and a half months. I don’t know you well, miss… but I can imagine what you’re going through. If you need me to help or talk to the police, if you want me to be a witness… No, I don’t want any of that for now. I had my Brian when I was 14. His dad was my mom’s brother. I’m from El Dorado. When I got pregnant I left, and never saw him again. And if you could see him now, would you? The bastard died. He was a lazy drunk. My mom always stood up for him. When I heard he’d been knifed to death at a party… I was happy. But when I got home that night, I cried like crazy. Brian asked me what was wrong… I didn’t know what to tell him. I didn’t know if I was crying with happiness… or with anger… that I hadn’t killed him myself. The one who raped you was Ciro. He’s the oldest. He doesn’t go to the school. He works at the sawmill. I went out with him a few times. How are you so sure it was him? Because he told me. Ciro what’s his name? I don’t know his surname, I just call him Ciro. What does he look like? Ciro. I need to talk to you. Now? No, it’ll take too long. What do you want? Nothing will happen to you. Nobody knows I’m here. What do you want? I told you, I need to talk. It’s all I ask of you. I don’t think you can deny me this. Don’t panic, I swear nothing will happen to you. It’s just for a bit. Then you’ll never see me again. I checked. You finish at noon on Thursday. You have the afternoon off. I’ll see you at 5:00 p.m. on Thursday. I won’t be with the police, don’t worry. See you there. Ciao. Hey. Where? The same place. Was meeting him important for you? What are you implying? Perhaps you needed to see him first? You mean the Stockholm syndrome? -I wouldn’t call it that. -Really? Did you ever think about it? No. So why mention it? It’s not the first time someone’s mentioned it. And you think that’s a coincidence? The Stockholm syndrome is a rich girl, who gets off on her kidnapper. I was raped, got pregnant, I just wanted to see the rapist’s face. Explain the similarity. I’m not in love and I’m not confused. Okay. So what were you hoping for? To find out the truth. Shouldn’t you leave that to the justice system? When the poor are involved, they don’t want truth, just the guilty. And why did you go see him? Paulina. -You’re going now? -Yes. -Sure you don’t want me to come? -Yes. Listen to me. If you haven’t called before 6:00 to say you’re okay, I’ll tell the police. -Got it? -Yes. -Don’t worry. -Call me. Yes. Ciao. -Welcome to Paraguay. -Thanks. -Anything to declare? -No. We’ll start the check. -When are you done? -In about an hour. She’s keeping it, isn’t she? I don’t know. You’re not going to do anything? There’s not much I can do, it’s her decision. She’s not fit to decide. I know, but still. How can you be so calm? She needs help and I can’t help her. I promise you I’m trying. You’re not doing enough. Because you’re her dad. She’s doing this because of you and your job. There’s an inquiry, it’s not my place to get involved. What they did to her is a serious crime. As a judge, you can’t allow this. I can’t go against her decision, my daughter’s an adult. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. An adult who knows her rapists and still won’t report them. What? They’re students from the school. She knows their names but does nothing. Is that true? How are you? Good. What are those things for? I came to fetch them. I’ll be at Laura’s. It’s for the best. There? Yes, it’ll be easier for me. -Hello, Doctor Vidal. -Hello, thanks for coming. You’re welcome. A gang from your zone did something to my girl. I heard, but we were told not to act. I know, that was my request. Now I need you to take care of it. What do you need exactly? Identify the attackers, arrest them, and stick them all in a cell. And I need… total discretion. One of them works at the sawmill. Another one’s in the project, but don’t look for them there… seize them on their turf. Stop, police! On the ground! -What’re you doing here? -What’s your name? Hey! Hey! Don’t move! Police! Don’t move! Stop! Don’t move! Stop! Police! Come here you little shit! Don’t move! Put your hands on the car! Hands on the car, I said! Legs apart! Playing the bad boy now? Was it you that fucked her? I didn’t do it, I swear. It was Ciro. Why are you crying, faggot? Get up! So you’re the macho? Open the cell. Get up! You’ll see… Come here! I’ll show you… Here he is. Repeat what you just said. Tell me, was it him? Yes. I’m gonna show you! Speak for fuck’s sake! You like this, don’t you? If you need more time, let me know. Good. Miss Vidal… they’re here for the lineup, you know the procedure. When you’re ready, please. Tell me. It’s not them. -Are you sure? -Yes. Let’s go? -What’s up? -Nothing. I don’t know. I don’t like what you’re doing, I don’t understand. I’ve helped you this far, but I’ve had enough. What do you want to prove? I don’t want to prove anything. Who you’re trying to prove it to? I can’t take anymore. I don’t agree with what you’re doing. Okay. You’re going to be late. Aren’t you scared you’ll see your rapist in your child? Forgive me. Forgive me, please. Forgive me. Leave us alone for a moment, please. What are you going to do? See what they did to them? -To who? -Did you see them or not? Why didn’t you leave it to me? -What would you have done? -I was doing better than you lot. Better? What are you saying? Come on, Fernando. I’m acting in accordance with the law. You’re acting coldly and objectively. You know those guys are your attackers. If those guys are arrested and end up in jail, who does it help? Me? You? Who? It’s justice, that doesn’t matter. It’s the law, you know it very well. The law that made you decide the police should batter them, drag a confession from them, lawfully beat them. Don’t be unfair, it was you who didn’t want to report them. Who didn’t want a trial, who became obsessed, with an incomprehensible crusade. Messianic and pointless. Forget how they got the confession, how they arrested them, how they fucked up. You feel better now they’re in jail? Are you glad? Yes, I’m glad. Those guys raped you, attacked you. They could have killed you. I’m a judge, Paulina. That guy’s a rapist. Who says he hasn’t raped before? That he won’t do it again? -I don’t know. -Ah. I was trying to understand before deciding… Oh please! What way was that? Denying what happened to you. What happened to you is horrific! The worst thing that can happen to someone. It happened to you, love. It happened, they raped you. You’re a victim, not a heroine. You’re a victim! Why are you so upset I want to have this child? It’s not about having the baby, it’s about you. You didn’t go mad when I was raped. Nor when I didn’t want a trial, or when I went back to the school, only when I decided to have the child. Why? Because it’s the child of a rape. What if Alberto had raped me? One drunken night, it’s possible. I could have got pregnant. What are you saying? That’s not what happened. But what would you say? Now I’m going to ask you a question. If it had been Alberto who raped you, if it was his kid… what would you do then? What would you do? The same thing? Or would you have an abortion? -I’d have an abortion. -You’d have an abortion? -Yes. -So? It’s okay, don’t worry. Please, my darling… You’ve still got time… reconsider… No. I’m not crazy. I don’t think you’re crazy either. Nor that you’ve become a reactionary. I understand you, I do. I don’t know what I’d have done if I were you. Probably the same thing. Or worse. The bastards raped your daughter. You’re right, everyone would agree. But I’m not you. I’m me. It happened to me. Nobody can understand unless they’ve been through it. Do you know what? You’re right, I am a victim. I’m a victim. But do you want to know what I honestly believe? That being a victim doesn’t help me. I’m the product of a terrible world, that only generates violence. Enough, please… I can’t take anymore! Shut up! This child is the product of a reality that you cannot understand. Me neither. But I’m sure of one thing… I don’t want to get rid of it. It’s inside me, I want it to be born. You and I don’t matter now, nor the bastard who raped me, it’s something else now. It doesn’t matter whether I have an abortion. It’s something else now. I’m here now. I didn’t choose to be here. But I’m here. I can’t go, I don’t want to go. I’m here. I want to carry on. Paulina Vidal. Have we finished? Do you have any more questions? No, I don’t think so, that will do. What will you write? What? In the report? What we’ve spoken about… what you told me, what I observed. Can I go then? Whenever you like. We’re listening… Do you swear, with full knowledge and a clear conscience… to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I swear. PAULINA
