Thank you very much. -I'm sorry, I didn't want... -Aubergine dip? One thing only separates life from death. Time. Between them this only exists. Time. Universe was born... You know about Big-Bang? -I watched something on TV. -And it is going to die. Like we do. Right this moment a universe is dying. Time is counting down in us... This instrument... is a... magical factor. He who controls time will be God. I believe it is the instrument of... the Creator. -Whose? -'Whose?' Victor, you're becoming boring. I admit I've never been good in physics. -Yet I'm going to read your book. -I'm not good in physics either. -Water, anybody? -Yes, please. Yes, I want some. You never know... You may get ovarian cancer and die. Is it mineral? No, we've got only tap water. Did you buy wine and not mineral water? -'Gospodin Robota.' -I'm going. I went to paradise for this wine. 'The vineyard of God.' -What 'gospodin' means? -Are you sure I don't need to go? 'Gospodin Robota' in Russian means 'Get to work, Mister.' Psychological time is a delusion. It does not exist. -Psychological time? -Nature time... does exist. It is measured... by planetary motion. Or by Cosma's trip to the grocery for mineral water. Or by his graduation six years ago. And see now how happy I am. -You're speaking with your mouth full. -Eureka! Everything comes down to motion. Pythagoras would say 'motion in time.' Time is different notion. That's what Plato says. It has no relation to the motion that determines the appearance of your wine at the table. -I'm going to meet Plato soon... -God forbid! This Plato of yours... plays in Real or Barcelona? He's a reserve. For now he philosophizes on the bench. Is this the sixth or seventh, Romi? Cheers! -Romi, drink all the bottle! -Cheers! Bottoms up, then! Very good wine, Bogdan. What is it? -White wine from paradise. -I can see that. 'The Vineyard of God.' Enjoy! Cosma bought it. Light wine for noon. No man should ever get drunk at noon. -And women too? -What do you mean by 'women too?' Are not women humans too? Woman was made from man's rib. -Right... What do you say, Gilda? -Woman is a bone, not a human. Like what they say in Ardeal. 'Children and girls.' -Like in your family. -Here, in Bucharest? I don't get you. You were the pillar of the household. And mother was the 'woman.' And what is this supposed to mean? -You were the head of the family. -Is this an attack, Sasha? -No. -It seemed like one to me. I'm sorry, I'm a little bit... Dad, I'd like to ask another question. More questions? Yes, more. As always. Cosma! -Julie works... -For a website. -On the history of Communism. -I told that yesterday. Great... So what? Bravo! We should make a toast for Julie. Cheers! Your name is mentioned... in documents Julie is studying. -Well, what of it? -I'd like to ask... If it's true what they say. They say you were... that you passed information to the Security Service, no, to the Police, under Ceausescu. You informed on women... that had abortions. What did I do, Cosma? I'm translating these articles for the website. They mention the Act 770 of 1966. that banned abortions, describe its content... and include a list with doctors' names who pushed the law further away. -'Further away?' -By applying the law strictly. They informed on women who attempted to have an abortion and went to hospitals... The correct wording is 'we prevented abortions.' Right. So, did you do that? I don't get it. You say it's your name indeed? Yes, Sasha. I prevented abortions. And you confirm it just like that? Do I have to feel ashamed of myself? Of course. Romanian women acquired this right 20 years ago. And you say that just like this? What's this, Sasha? Why should I feel ashamed? I didn't inform on women. I just prevented abortions. If this is 'denunciation', well who's the 'denunciator'? You've never told us about it. We thought it might be not you. -No, I was. -You know that it was not right. On the contrary! It was the rightest thing. Then why haven't you told us anything about it? You said we filter reality through our prejudices. -And your own prejudices... -Come on now, father! Will you let me finish? May I speak? -I just think... -Can I explain? -Do you want me to stop? -Let him explain himself. So, our prejudices... Your opinions are too absolute about this period. If I had ever told you, we'd have had a quarrel on questions of principle and that is aimless. -So you were collaborating after all? -I was not collaborating with the system. Then what were you doing? -I prevented abortions. Full stop. -In what manner? I believe no one can take decisions on the life of another person. It is their life. And everyone's free to decide for their lives. The matter is you've been lying to us! -You've never asked me! -It's the same! -You were scared! -Of what? You shouting at me? You knew it was not right! You pretended to be God and took decisions about others. No, Victor would pose as God if he performed abortions, if he allowed abortions to be performed. Others acted as if they were Gods. Abortion was prohibited by law. And the consequences were not serious. -There were women who died. -Because they didn't have abortions? Because they had in unsanitary conditions. Therefore, they died because of the abortion. You and people like you didn't let them have them under decent conditions. -Babies were born deformed. -The people like me? We prevented illegal abortions. You said you did it by choice. Legal or illegal, I disagreed with abortions. Nothing serious happened to these women. -Come on now dad... -They had children! That's all! They were compelled to bring them up responsibly. Or let them go to the orphanage... Because they were irresponsible! Children should be brought up in normal conditions. You deprived them of their freedom. You didn't allow them to make their choice. How you dare talk to me like that? You and Cosma know everything and put me up against the wall! So you know it wasn't right. Last night you blamed the system, now we learn you were a part of it. Everyone knows what 'informing' really meant. You misbehave, Romeo. -Have another drink and shut up! -You shut up! -How you dare? -Stop it! Are you drunk? -I'm not a snitch anyway! -What a nerve! Big thing! I pulled the sweater I bought for him. This isn't the first time. -Are you drunk? -What matters if I am? -What's this manner? -He's right, Romeo. Romeo and Sasha drink too much. And what's your problem? Mind your own shit! Go and 'turn me in' for drinking! I can't understand something. Let's assume that my guilt... was real. -How you dare, Cosma. -How you dare! -Don't interrupt me! -You've no right to ask this thing! -How you dare judge me? -And you? -Cosma! -I'm not judging you! -You're judging me all the time. -What's this tone? What's all this? I brought you up and helped you study medicine. You had anything you need. The same goes for the bonsai tree here. Did you learn how to talk back at university? -Sorry, but you deserve it. -Cut it out! -You don't deserve respect. -Why? You have done things that cannot be annulled with the passage of time. -What you have done... -What have I done, Cosma? Think without emotions, without prejudices. Think. What have I done? I prevented abortions. Bollocks! You ruined human lives, dad! -You ruined us too. -Watch your tongue! Enough, dad! Are you crazy? Have you all gone nuts? Sasha, are you now teaching the philosophy of 'bollocks'? You can't do this to our family! Shut your mouth! Mind the way you talk or... For our guests at least! -Regardless of my alleged guilt! -Stop yelling! -I will slap you! -Try if you dare! You think I can't smash your face in? Please, don't quarrel over this matter. And you 'princess of bollocks...' if you want to know your mother wanted to get rid of both you and Romeo. -Lies! -Lies? Are you calling me a liar now? -Mother didn't want to have an abortion. -How do you know this? -Bullshit! -You didn't even exist back then! I know it's bullshit! Because no abortions were allowed now you can say 'shut up,' 'bullshit,' 'liar.' -Then you should have done it! -Yes, it might have been better. Demented! You're all demented. Because you can't give us a beating anymore? Shut your mouth! Or I'm going to smash your face in. You know what's the matter, Cosma? You are a big stupid jerk! -I know. -Unfortunately, you're my son too. I had so different hopes for my 34year-old son. -Like what? -Being normal. -And am I not normal? -You are a cretin! -Dad, don't... -I'm leaving. Where to? -Let him go. -Cut it out, Cosma! I will leave when I want to. This is my home, Cosma! -My home! Get out of here! -I won't. -Get out. -I won't. -Don't touch me! -Cosma, no! -Out! -Do something, Romi! Out of my house! -Out! -Stop it! -I'll hit you! -That's the only thing you know. -Stop it! -What children I have brought up! -Gilda, call a psychiatrist. -Fuck you, old man! Romi, no! Are you stoned? How dare you talk like that to dad? -My God! -Imbeciles! Dad, don't go! Never mind, Gilda. Will you tell me what happened? You don't really need to go and speak to him. All right but was it wrong to ask him if you're OK? Don't you want to learn what he believes about all that? -Therefore, you know. -Not exactly. I know you had a quarrel. -Is that what he told you? -Yes. -What did he say? -Not much. He couldn't say more. Will you tell me? What's all this paranoia? It isn't paranoia. I have the impression that many people knew about Victor's doings. I simply have a lot of questions. For example... It's a stupid question but how did mother tell you she was pregnant with us? -A stupid question indeed. -Sure. You think I remember? She told you, 'Do you know any doctor that performs abortions?' Or 'I'd like you to be the godmother of my twins.' She wanted you. This was the question, wasn't it? Dad says the opposite. Yes, this was the question. So, he lied to us. Of course he did. OK. But what has annoyed you most? That he was OK with everything he did. But what gets on my nerves most was that everyone knew all about it except for us. Why is knowing important to you? At what age should he have spoken to you about it? At 3? At 7? At 18 perhaps. 'Great. Santa Claus came.' 'And your father has done this and that.' 'Breaking news' at a decisive age? It's one thing to gather the family, sit us down and talk to us And it's another to learn it yourself accidentally. Do you let your father know everything you do? When I gave up university I announced it during a family gathering. What now? Why do you have to dig into the past? He said he acted according to his principles. And you deemed right to abandon your studies. I didn't inflict so much pain on him. -You have to either accept it or... -He must come back home. -All right, let him come. -The question is what will come next. Romi can't sleep at night. -Are you worried about that? -Yes, you screw my sleep as well. If the discussion with Victor went like this... you'd give us a beating, wouldn't you? -I've got a small build. -You've got mugs, ashtrays... -You'd chase us away immediately. -They can't cause a lot of damage. And you can't say 'Fuck you, old man.' Did you say that? Is it true? And why can't you sleep? Or can you? I saw mum in a dream the other night and I... What are you doing? -Am I intruding? -Yes. Yes? One question only. I want to know if you feel that you have received love. -We have all received love. -Me too, you believe? Yeah. -From whom? -From God... -From me... -From you? So, you love me after all, Gilda. All right. That I wanted to know. -Anything wrong? -Mysterious as always. What's the matter, Sasha? What did she say? -Do you want me to leave? -Nah! Come down to dinner! -Are you listening to me? -No. -Come down or I'll go up myself! -That's all we needed. Let's go down. Show me that with the piano. It went like that. Not this one. Look, I'm not a pianist. The other one... where you tap on dots. Don't you feel like dancing? What is it? Stop it. -What? -What's wrong? -Nothing. -Are you sure? Cut it out, please. -You got work to do? -Yeah. -Stay put! -Stop. Bring me some water. -Let me come a bit closer. -Romi! -I want water! -In a moment. Then I'll show you my scar. I promise. -I'm too lazy... -Romi! Stop it, Romi! Isn't Gilda at home? -We are alone. -How do you know that? -What are you doing there? -We're playing. Cut it out! And you locked me out of toilet while playing... -It was not locked. -It was, on the other side. If you ever lock again, I'll take the key from you! -All right. -You'll never lock again. -All right? -All right. What's this all secretiveness? Damn you! This was the last time, Romi. The last. I told you I don't want this to happen again. And you agreed. -Come on! -I want you to stop doing it. -What? -What we do. -What we do? -We fuck each other. -So what? -I want this to stop. -Suddenly like that? -It is not sudden. We've already agreed this should never happen again. Look, Dad writes to Gilda. I don't want us to do it again. I'm with Alex. How long did it take to you to realize you are with Alex? -Have I done anything wrong? -Yes. I told you to stop. Am I doing this alone? Are we not together in this? -Have I made it up out of my mind? -I can't resist. -Because you like it. -Yes I like it. -And is this a bad thing? -Yes, it is. -Why? -I've got a boyfriend. -See you tonight. -Goodbye, Coma. Around '67-'69, many of us were unwanted babies. It's not simple to tell when a baby is wanted or not. It might have been unwanted because its mother is scared... of dying during childbirth. My mother was in labour for 20 hours... when my sister was born. Caesarean was not allowed back then. -It wasn't allowed? -It was not. You needed a special permit. And when she got pregnant again she was scared. Wasn't she afraid of the abortion? -My mother? -Yes. -She never thought of it. -Never? You could end up in prison. At your time as well? Yes... till '89. Why did you want to have an abortion? I was too young. -If you ever went back in time? -I would do the same. -You would have an abortion? -Yes. -For the same reason? -Yes. -Because you were too young? -Yes. If I told you 'Emma, I'm pregnant', what would you advise me? It depends on who's the father, the circumstances... The father of the baby loves me very much. -Can you start a family? -No. -Are you really pregnant? -Say that I am. How far along are you? One month, for sure. -Who's the father? -My friend. Social conditions are very hard. He's is not in good terms with my family and I am not with his own either. It's impossible under these circumstances. -And you want to abort it... -Yes. Think it over, a couple of weeks more. You've still got time, you're only one month. If you feel the same two weeks from now... we will see, will arrange it. -Did you have a row? -No, it's a party. What? Gilda must have her name day celebration. Our best wishes, Gilda. I'm sorry for yesterday. I wish you all the best. Health and peace. -Can we speak? -We can. -How about a cigarillo, Bogdan? -I'll have it whatever it is. -Let's go talk in the kitchen. -I'll take whatever you have. I was thinking of you when I bought it. Seriously? -We were together. -That's right. The password? First, I'm sorry for the trouble I stirred about the email. I was shocked because he responded only to you. I also went to Emma and had a discussion about mum, dad and the abortion. About whether mother wanted to abort us. I'm just curious. It isn't out of some strong emotion though I'm not actually feeling any. I just want to know the truth above anything else. -Honestly, I don't know. -Could you a find a way to learn? You've got the best relationship with him. You can ask him. I sent him a message but he didn't answer. I didn't ask if he meant it seriously but... You know... I don't think it's fair... It's not normal... It's a discrimination... having four children and not showing the same affection for all. Showing more affection for some of them. What are you referring to? -To what happened after... -To everything. They say the conditions in which you were born leave their mark on you. You was a wanted child. This doesn't mean that... they didn't want me or Romi. I just... think that... if it's true... -What's going on, Gilda? Leave me alone, Bogdan. I'll be right back with you. Listen... She became pregnant with us after '89. She could have an abortion legally. Unless father didn't let her. Well then he might have acted in accordance to his principles. That's why I want to know if you... -Do you want to help me? -Give him some time. -Then I'll have a normal talk with him. -Promise me. -We're going to learn. -Splendid. That was it. -So, you were baptized... -Yes. -You've taken my seat. -There are seats for everyone. -Will you stop the music? -Music? It's not mine. -Give that one... How do we call it? -Charlotta... Is anybody here in this house? We've got news. Julie found a job. I warmed it up. The fork is coming. -There you are! -I am the fork! -Thank you. -It's nothing. -Congratulations. -Merci. Sit down here. -Where will you move to? -I don't know. I have an idea... I thought we should discuss the lack of affection at home. I'd like to call dad... if I'm not spoiling the mood. You, the two males, are the biggest problem. Do you want us to hold this conference now? Yes... preferably. Brilliant! Let's skype him! Rubbish... Did you know that dad has got a friend? -He has not. -Dad has got a friend. -How do you know that? -It's his life. Cosma, you're lying. -Where's the harm in it? -Hospital gossip? You just want to spite us. -Rumours are born somehow. -Exactly. -Give me a cigarette. -How are you so sure about it? -I saw them together at the hospital. -You should have let us know. I didn't hide it. I thought he first should have let us know. I saw them hugging each other. -You never give hugs, do you? -Not like they did. She is a widow too if this makes you feel better... What? Is she a widow too? Did she also become a widow 18 months ago? What? Did she also become a widow 18 months ago? I've no idea but they seem to be together for some time. -I've got three nuts. -Father hasn't been well. -Turn up the music! -Three nuts for all of us. -This is hollow. -That hurt. A hollow nut! -Its name speaks for itself. -A 'hollow' joke! Let's see now the third. -I'm so glad to see you again. -I am, too. -Hello. -Hello. Over here, if you don't mind. And one for you... Will you fill'em up? Naturally. I've got backache. -How are you doing? -Cosma cursed me. My back aches since the day I hit him. As for the rest, I'm doing well. How about you? Very nice house. I will convey it. Bogdan, would you please let us alone for a while? Certainly, no problem. -How are you? -And you? How am I supposed to be. Work and all else... I came with Bogdan but I think it would be better if we spoke alone. There is a very strange mood at home. I don't know what to say, Gilda. I'm letting time pass till things get calmer. I don't know what to say. I'd like to ask you about the thing you said. Did mother want to have an abortion? Is it true? I realized how stupid of me was saying this thing. Some things... hurt too much... Yes, it's true. It is also true that... it was too cruel. I shouldn't have said it. Ioanna wasn't alone in this. We were both wondering how we could make ends meet... with the twins. It was a hard trial but I decided against the abortion. So that's why you said this thing. Let's forget about it. I'll say it was my mistake, that I am to blame. I'll say it wasn't the truth and we'll all forget about it. Father, are you living with someone? -I heard the washing machine... -Yes, Gilda, I'm living with someone. Is she your lover? You can put it this way if you like. She's the woman I'm living with. It doesn't mean we're going to get married. She asked me to live together and I accepted. -We're getting along very well. -I'm glad for you, father. -Are you honestly? -I am. Please, don't cry? You're trembling, Gilda? Aren't you feeling well? I'm fine. Maybe I don't look so still I'm well inside me. Are you truly? Do you get along with Bogdan? -He proposed to me. -This is splendid! -But I don't want to... -Why, my Gilda? It's splendid. Why did you tell him to go outside? Great news! Congratulations! -I like Bogdan very much. -Really? I swear I do. I like him very much. Romi? Look. I'm pregnant. -Are you kidding me? -No, I'm telling the truth. From whom? From me? No, from the Holy Spirit. -Does anyone else know it? -No. Only you. -And now? -You tell me. I came to ask your opinion. I haven't made up my mind yet. -How are you doing, 'Alpha'? -I'm all right, 'Beta'. I was meaning the car. 'Alpha Romeo.' -How is it going? -Fine. -Aren't you feeling well? -She's feeling very well. -What happened to her? -Beer must have made her sick. Tell me. What do we have here? A parent-teacher conference? Tell me. -What's wrong? -I'm pregnant. Come here, Julie. Have a look! Gilda, what the hell is this? Come and see! It's scaring me. Is it going to stay here? I'll never sleep in this room again. It's a present! Who's giving such presents? Bogdan. Do you like it? Instead of a solitaire ring? Rubbish! -Don't become mean! -I'm sorry. -It's just scaring me. -And it'll grow bigger. -It's a poor little soul. -Yes, of course. Let's pretend I'm already loving it. Some friends staying at university's residence hall were smoking pot and got a hamster high. They were blowing smoke on it. They found it very funny. -And what about the hamster? -It possibly had a great time too. A hamster stoned... What's happening? Open the door, Sasha. Have you gone crazy? It's occupied. How 'occupied'? -Is anything wrong? -No. Open the door! -Give Romi a shout! -Open! -Call Romeo, Cosma, please! -Come on, open up! Don't make me beg you! -Call Romi to come. -First, open the door. -Tell him to come. -You'll first open the door. -Then I won't open the door. -Please! You're all completely mad here! Sasha, open the door. -Did Cosma go away? -Yes. Open. What's the matter? What happened? -Are you feeling ill? -No. What's wrong? Listen, about the baby... Is Alex the father? Is it mine? Are you sure? I'm sorry. Everything will be alright. Everything will be fine. -Sasha? -Yes. May I come in? No. Cosma said you're in a terrible state. I'm OK. Go get me something, whatever... otherwise, I'm going to vomit. -Sasha! -Leave me in peace! -Have you got an upset stomach? -A little bit, yes. -Everything will be alright. -Don't let Gilda get in. No! -Let me... -Stop! -What is it? -Nothing. But you've been crying. -What's going on? -Get out. Please! Cosma is worrying about you. Nice of him. Please, get out. Bogdan and I are going on a trip. On holiday. I would be very obliged to you if you can take care of my little one. I think... looking after it will be good for you. Where are you going? -On holiday. -Now? In October? -Where? With... -With Bogdan. He is so little. Yes and he gets out all the time. I can't find my mobile. Say something. 'Good morning', 'Hello.' You know something, Julie... Do you remember when... when we were 6 years old and mum brought you here? Yes, I remember it. -A perfect conversation! -Yeah. -OK, so what? -And since then, the three of us... You often slept here. Sometimes in our room, sometimes in Cosma's. -Yes, what are hinting at? -I'm just saying... I want you to do something for me. Go and stay with Romi but make it appear as if you wanted it by your own will. Don't you want to stay with us? I want to keep your mouth shut. Call Romi, ask him this thing and don't make questions. How're things going, Romeo? All right. I'll have an immoral idea to propose. I want you to become... I want us to move out and stay together. What for? To be independent from the Anghelescu family. To seek our independence like Barcelona. What 'independence' can there be with you? You'll get as much independence as you want! -Do you want to? -I don't. Are you really going to stay here with the hamster? I just don't want to move out right now. When will you want to? I don't know. The right time for this will come. I swear, on my honour, I'll have a piss. Come and play with me. You promised. You are rushing! You are rushing! I want to stay here Is this all right? -How are you doing? -I'm doing well. -Where have you been? -At Emma's. -And what were you doing? -We were talking about the abortion. How's that? -'How's that?' You must be drunk. -What did you say about the abortion? About whether I should do something and I decided that I will. -You took the decision just like that? -Yes. Cut it out, Romi. -I want us to talk. -Let's talk. -And not play on the tablet. -All right, I'm listening. -I don't want you to abort. -OK. This is your opinion. -Let's talk about it. -I will have an abortion. My body, my problem, my decision. I'm too young, I'm not ready, I don't want it. It has nothing to do with you but... But what? The decision is mine. And I can't keep the baby. It's not your decision. The baby belongs to both of us. It is not a normal baby. It didn't appear magically out of thin air. It isn't normal! This thing cannot be done in a normal society. -Why? -Because this is incest, dammit! Sit down and talk. You are not going anywhere! First, stop saying that this is incest. It's a word that sounds bad. It has nothing to do with us. -The baby was born out of our love. -It hasn't been born yet. -Yes, it was born. -No, it hasn't been. -I have simply conceived. -Yes, you have. It exists. OK, we'll talk again when you are sober. I'm not drunk and I want us to discuss. Can you stay put for ten minutes? Can you? May I have some water? I'm going to get you water. Can't we raise it? Don't laugh, please! Can we raise this child today? In Romania? No, we can't. -Why? -For many reasons. -Like what? -I'm 22 years old. I can't have this responsibility We've got no money, no... -This issue concerns us both! -OK, both of us. What we do is totally illegal. OK! What are they going to do? Impose a fine because we're in love and having a baby? Love has nothing to do with it. It surely has. This happened because of love. No, it has nothing to do with love. With my love for you. Baby is an entirely different matter. It'll be a provocation. We will cause a reaction from the people. -Will we do such thing? -Due to the fact of our incest. Will we cause a reaction? You think they won't know whose baby it is? You fantasize about being together about becoming parents... This is impossible. -It is legal in Northern Europe. -I don't give a damn. It's my body and I don't want this baby! -It's my affair too! -You have no say in this matter! I have! It's my baby too! You are the most important person in my life. We are in love. Do we need a baby in order to prove it? If you get rid of it, I will feel guilty throughout my life. -Why? -Because... It is evident, isn't it? Because... I will kill a creature that was brought in life by both of us. By you... the woman I love. There will never be anything more regrettable in my life. What else do you want me to say? What's more decisive than this? I don't believe we must care about what the people are going to say. Especially when... in Europe and in the most developed countries it is considered normal. Even Freud said that this is an instinct everyone has it. In some people it becomes manifest. In others no. -It is not acceptable. -I merely say... You regard it as something very... as something morbid... This annoys me very much because it isn't morbid. We are in love and for this reason what happened just happened. I feel it is... if not a sign... There's no need for confirmation. It just happened. I feel we must keep this baby... There is no reason other than our love. I feel that we must do it. I want it. Why can't we have this baby? -Romi, have you gone crazy? -Why are you saying this? You are in panic. You are frightened. I understand. Yet let's try to think more calmly. Why can't you do that? -Listen... You love me, right? -Yes. Then let me do what I want. -I can't let you do what you want! -Please. Are you OK? Let's go. -What's wrong with her? -I don't know. -We had a joint. -What? -We smoked a little weed. -What? -Let's go home. -I'm fine. Sasha, let's go home. Take it easy! Leave her alone. Take her home. She fainted. Easy now! OK? I'm so thirsty! Be careful, Romeo! Please, Sasha, get up. We're in the middle of the street. We're reaching the car. -Let me be! -Get in the car! -Do we have water? -Be patient for a bit. Tell me, what did you take? I don't understand what you mean. But if you tell me... Drugs, dammit Sasha! What did you take? Couple troubles... -Double couple troubles! -We must go to hospital. No! If you don't want to go to hospital, tell us what you took. What did you drink? I'll tell you when you say 'double couple troubles'! Double couple troubles! That was it. -Excellent! -I know. It's OK. -Have you got a stomachache? -Nah. Where's your pain? -Let me alone! -You'll fall down. -I'm going for a walk. -Let her walk a bit. -Leave me alone! -Where are you heading for? -Leave me... -What's the matter? Please! -What the fuck was that? -What? I kissed her to calm her down. -Are you serious? -Yes, it worked. Sasha, how are you feeling? Romi, I want you to leave. -I want you to leave. -We'll talk about it some other time. Sasha, why should he leave? I want you to leave. Sasha, can you hear me? How are you feeling? What did you take? -I'm not sure. -You're not sure... Check her pulse. -I sniffed heroin. -So you sniffed heroin? I think so. I want water. -Did you take anything else? -No. -Only heroin? -I don't know. I don't know what it was. You don't know what you took. There's something in it. -Bring her another. -It smells shit. -Why are you trembling? -I don't know. Romi? What? There are sedatives in the drawers in the kitchen. -What sedatives? -Sedatives. Go fetch them. Her pulse races. -Don't give her sedatives. -Go get them now! She's pregnant, they're not good for her. What? She's pregnant. How far along is she? One month. -OK then, let's take her to hospital. -No Go away. -Go away. -Why? Lie down. Go away. What? I want the father to go. What? I want the father to go. What in the devil? Romeo, tell me it isn't true! Let's go to hospital. Don't you dare get close to her ever again! Out! I'll have an abortion. We're going to see father. Whose is this house? Does this question sound normal to you? Cosma, what do you want? 'Whose is this house?' Are you a policeman or a prosecutor? Ask that on the phone! -I'm your son -You're my son and so what? You think you have the right to know everything? After the quarrel, you come here and ask these things! Of course there is an owner in this house! -Was that all? -No. Sit down then. -Will you have a drink? -Do you mind if I smoke? I don't. Use your own lighter though. Have you put a curse on me? I've got backache two weeks now. I've got a pain in my soul. And it still hurts. This is not bad. Sasha? 'Sasha' the maestro says. 'Sasha.' You can speak now. The maestro gives the OK with a lift of his baton. I meant 'Who's going to tell him? You or me?' Let her speak. Isn't she a responsible adult? I'm pregnant. Splendid news. Amazing news. My congratulations to you both. May I ask who's the felicitous father? -We know, I hope. -Of course we know. I can't do this. -Do I know him? -You know him very well. I'll be in the toilet. I'm sorry. I can't. Stay. I am going to tell him. It's Romi, father. The father is Romi. What do you mean by 'Romeo is the father'? Sasha and Romeo shagged each other. Sasha, what is all this Cosma says? Good Lord! For Christ's sake! Sasha, tell me it isn't true! -Please, forgive me. -How can Romeo be the father? I don't know how we got there, how it happened... How did it happen? Sasha, how on earth this happened! How? Sasha, you'll be the death of me! I gave you an education! -It isn't a matter of education. -Shut your mouth, Cosma! Shut up your mouth! What will you do? Beat her for what she's done? Cosma, you'd better leave now. You are autistic, slow minded and an idiot! -She needs us! -My attitude is not the problem! Idiot! How can an educated woman have a baby with her twin brother? They were brainless and slept together. Did you have to get pregnant too? Stupid! -Is this the problem? -Yes, not my attitude! Can't you see that she needs you? Jerk! -Stop! -Bastard! -Get out of my house! -Please stop it, Cosma! Get the hell out of here, scumbag! -Do you want me dead? -Please, stop it! -And one more thing... -I'm not your father any longer. Out! -You hurt me. -You aren't my father any longer. -Get out! -Please stop! It's not important anymore. What is important... She was in need of you... and I was in need of you. -I'm not listening to you, Cosma. -We were all in need of you. -And you behaved like a beast. -It's not like this. Never mind. Go, both of you, please... Sit down for a moment. You can go immediately. I'll call Mugurel. Go to him... He'll see you and... I'll discuss the details with him... -He?s not answering. -What if this weren?t Romeo?s baby... If you say it isn't his baby, I'll be cock-a-hoop about it! It would be a baby which you can give birth to... -This is a baby too! -Sasha, for God's sake! -You know the dangers! -I'm just speaking my mind... How can you take a risk like that? He gave me the number of a certain Mr Mugurel. What for? Abortion. No, we'll go elsewhere. I have arranged it. -When? -Right now. We're going there for a check-up, medical tests, right? For your abortion. Now? Yes... He's a colleague at the hospital. He's got a private practice. Are we going now for my abortion? Yes, he's expecting us. You may come in in a minute. Hello? Yes... Yes, that's me. Yes, you called my number. -What do you mean? -What is it? Something happened to Gilda. I'm going to make a call outside. Maybe an accident or... You, stay here. No, I'm coming with you. Gaby, I have to be going. Sasha is going to stay. Please, look after her, will you? Thanks. -In a moment. -I'm sorry. I have to go now. I used to say that only one thing separates life from death. Time. Between one and the other there is only time. Our universe was born. It is going to die. Right this moment we're speaking, a universe is dying. They say that a meteorite fell on earth millions of years ago and kill all the dinosaurs and so luckily for us. Otherwise, there would be no humans and you would not bear my nonsense like you do now... We ought to see accidents through a different prism, as something positive, because... they change our lives. They certainly can deprive us of our own lives, bring about radical changes in the life of our own people. Many times we hear that an accident is someone's fault. Yet we never say that nature makes mistakes. It sends asteroids, typhoons, earthquakes... But we do say it is something natural. Therefore we are perhaps not right when we claim that we make mistakes. They help us evolve and change. I'm not looking for excuses, but I have a feeling that... I feel evil and humiliated by this very 'instrument' I've already mentioned. Time. Humiliated, because only a while ago, I would die of shame and sorrow if I ever figured out that my twins were going to have a baby. Time transformed everything and I don't know how this happened. I have no clue. Now, I've got a little granddaughter whom I adore. If she ever were in danger I would tear down the universe to save her. And I'm serious about it. Very simply because I love her! And I can't understand how this happened! Time is the instrument of God. Unless... Unless it is God himself. Who wants to hear a song? We do. I mean, I do. -I rehearsed it with Romeo -This one here? Two hands! Pat and... Patachon? -Patachon. -For two hands only! -They rehearsed it. -With two hands, I mean. What is it? Bach? -Too slow. -Beethoven. Too fast. -It's the 'Moonlight Sonata'. -Yes, that sonata. Romi is getting increasingly better at chess. A bit more wine? Now, now! I wouldn't be a friend of yours if I didn't drink from your wine. Very good wine. It hasn't lost its kick. Maybe a little bit. Let's take a picture. -What do you say? -Altogether? -I'll take it. -All right. -Click this! -This? -Just a moment... -Is it all right like that? Julie, go between father and Romi... OK... A moment... I'm setting the timer. Wait. -Come here, silly. -Quickly. Where is it? I can't see it.
