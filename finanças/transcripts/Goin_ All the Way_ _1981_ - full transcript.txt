Goodnight, Monica. - Goodnight, Mrs. Mulligan. - What are you doing? - I better be going. - Oh come on, Monica. My mom's gone to bed. She's not gonna bother us again. - It isn't that, Artie. It isn't that at all. - Oh, come on, Monica. I'll be careful, I promise. Shit. Wait, Monica, wait. Don't be like that. Please, come on. - Artie, I just can't.

Hey, you guys! Artie Mulligan's got blue balls! - Hey, (mumbles), Reg. What do you think? Monica's a nice girl. - Oh yeah, yeah, that's right.

I know she will. It's just a matter of time. - Well, I'm just looking out for your welfare. You know, not doing it is harmful to the human body. I've been reading about it. - What are you doing, counting the days till school's over? - Nah, Wendy's late with her period again. Looks like I'm gonna have to break up with her. (laughing) - Hi, Artie. Hi. - Hi, Candy. - Hi. Have a nice weekend? - Yeah, I did, I did. How about you? - She had a great weekend, Mulligan. Eat your hearts out, jerk offs. - What an ass. - Yeah, you can say that again. (deliberative jazz music) (deliberative jazz music) - Time's up. Monica, will you collect the papers? Now that we've completed this text, you should be ready to go into the world and function as young adults. Are you? They call this class senior problems, but I wonder if we're addressing the real problems. Or could it be that you don't have any? Howard? - I was wondering about the meaning of life. (students laughing) No, no, I mean, why am I here and where am I going? - Go home. (students laughing) - Mr. Stevens, I have a problem. I can't decide who I like better, if it's Bo Derek or Loni Anderson. (students laughing) - Let's try to be serious just for once, all right, Reggie? - He is being serious, Mr. Stevens. He asks me about that all the time. - Don't listen to them, Mr. Stevens. They're a couple wise guys. You know what happens to wise guys? (laughing) - Why not talk about relationships? - She means sex, Mr. Stevens. - Yeah! (students laughing) That's what we are all thinking about anyway, isn't it? - Yeah, while she's around. (Artie laughing) - I have a feeling that class could get outrageous. - If you have anything to say about it. - Now, can I help it if I'm interested in romance? - Oh, is that what you call it? - Well, a girl has to have some fun. - I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pissed. - You mean Mitch slugged you for no reason? - He gets drunk. He goes crazy. The bastard. - Well, boyfriend or not, I think you oughta teach him a lesson. - What are you gonna do, Boom Boom? - I think we oughta kick his ass. - Artie, I'm telling you, girls say no when they mean yes. - Tell that to Monica. - She just needs a little more coaxing, that's all. Shit man, you ever read Cosmopolitan? That's all they talk about is doing it, and Monica's no different. - You faggot. You read Cosmopolitan? - My mom gets it, all right? You know what? Technique, that's the key word. - You know what? Bullshit, that's the key word and you know it. - [Instructor] All together now, girls. Let's go. Legs up, legs up, stretch, stretch. Really stretch.

If Monica doesn't go all the way soon, I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Well, you'll do what I do. You don't take no for an answer. (laughing) - [Instructor] Weis, Mulligan, beat it! - Holy shit. - Come on! - So Monica, how far did you let Artie go this time? - Yeah, Monica, how far did you let Artie go? - He can go as far as he wants with me anytime. - That's personal, you guys. - Come on, Monica. I'd tell you. - [Monica] Don't I know it. - [BJ] Still scared, huh? - It's getting worse. Artie makes it seem so necessary. I only wish I was sure about him. - Does he know you've never done it yet? - Why? You think I should tell him? - Oh god, no. Are you kidding? God, guys want girls that are experienced. - I thought they all wanted virgins. - That too. Face it, guys don't know what they want. It's up to us to tell them. (motorcycle engines revving) - Hi.

(laughing) - What do you think a senior in high school should know about sex? - You go deaf if you do it too much. - Where did you hear that kind of nonsense? - Hey? (students laughing) - Why do we need to learn about sex? It should just come natural. - Natural in what way? - Well, if a guy and a girl like each other, they should just do it. - Yeah, but it's not so simple for girls. I mean, if a guy really likes a girl, then he should respect her feelings, no matter what. - Now, what you're saying is girls are different from boys. - Not as much as you think. - Speak for yourself. - Yeah, girls get migraines if they don't keep doing it. (students laughing) Don't they? (students laughing) - Teenage sex can lead to a lot of problems. Emotional stress, family conflict, unplanned pregnancies. So each of you must ask yourself this very important question. Is an hour of physical pleasure worth a lifetime of remorse? - How do you make it last an hour? (students laughing) (deliberative jazz music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Look, I was wondering, can I borrow your skates Friday night? Artie's taking me skating. - Sure. Hey, you know, it sounds like everything's going okay. - Yeah. Actually though, Artie's been acting kind of weird lately. I think something's up. - They call it a pocket rocket. - No, seriously. What do you think's the matter with him? - Oh, it's nothing you couldn't fix, I'm sure. Hey, do you think my boobs are getting any bigger? - [Monica] Why? - Well, I've been trying positive thinking. Maybe I should send away for one of those bust developers. - Why don't you try a padded bra? - Oh Monica, you know that bras give me a rash. (upbeat rock music) - Little do they know. - It won't be long now. - Hey, I'm getting kinda excited about this. - Really? - I can't believe this. I haven't skated in so long. I don't know if I'm gonna remember how. - I can't believe they brought us here. I've been trying to talk Reggie into this for ages. - I know. I wonder why we are here. I mean, Artie can't skate. - Hey, can you skate? - Well, come on. I can't think of everything now, can I? Don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry. I'm a quick learner. Monica looks great tonight, you lucky bastard, you. - You're sure in a good mood tonight. - Well, why shouldn't I be? I'm with the best looking girl in the place.

You maybe get out of those sweats, do something with your hair. You ever read Cosmopolitan? Yeah, you know, how you dress, that's the whole ball game. - I don't like dresses. - Yeah, I know what you mean. I prefer them off rather than on myself. Hey, Boom Boom. What's the deal, huh?

You mean sex? - Yes, sex, and love, and... You're gonna be going out with boys pretty soon and then they're gonna try to do some really nasty things to you. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Like what? - Well, remember when we used to go to the zoo? Remember that? And the monkeys would lay on top of each other and move their little hineys back and forth? Remember? - Mom, that's sick. Does that have anything to do with those disgusting noises you and dad make at night? - Yes. - And in the morning? - Yes. - And in the afternoon? - Yes, yes! Your mother and father just love each other very much, dear. - Yeah, right, mom. Sounds more like elephants to me than monkeys. - Oh come on, dear. Your father's not that big. - Okay, that's enough. Role playing is supposed to help us become more sensitive to another person's feelings. Now obviously, some people are beyond help. (students laughing) - Come on, Mr. Stevens. I mean, who ever heard of your parents talking to you about sex anyway? - Yeah.

Now, how many of you have parents who have talked to you about sex?

(soft pop music) (water splashing) - This feels so good. - Candy, are you daydreaming about (mumbles)? - Such filthy mind. Look at Monica. You'd never hear anything like that outta her. - You mean like calling somebody a slut? No, I'd never say anything like that. - What did I do? - I think it's more what nature did. Cocktails anyone? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. (faint speaking) - Hey, are you ready to party? Ta-da! - Wow, if they had all this stuff in chemistry, I'd never cut class. - [BJ] Now just remember the party tonight. We have to be able to stand up. - Oh, speak for yourself. - No, really. We have to be adults and everything. - Look at this book! Zombie, Freddy Fuddpucker? Kamikaze, what is that? - I don't think a couple of Harvey Wallbangers would hurt anybody. - What is this? Talk dirty to me? - Candy. (Candy laughing) That was supposed to be a surprise for later. - A porno film? BJ, you're awful. - Well, if you don't want to see it, Monica. - Well, I didn't say that. - Pardon. Front row center, ladies. - [Actress On TV] Becomes so hot. I want to touch it. (moaning) - How does she do that? - Oh god, it's so big. (moaning) Want to talk dirty to me like you did to that girl on the phone? (moaning) - All this sex stuff is so confusing. How do they learn all those positions and things? - Hours and hours of practice. - When are the guys coming over anyway? (upbeat rock music) (water splashing) - Roger, I'd like you to meet my closest friend in the whole wide world, Monica Carr. - Hello. I'm Roger Jackson. - Hi. Betty Joe tells me you're a songwriter. - Among other things. You and BJ classmates? - Yeah. - We can't wait to graduate. You know, high school is really just for kids. - Depends on what you mean by kids. - [Female Speaker] BJ, we're out of ice. - Those idiots. Excuse me, you two. - Tell me about your songwriting. - Look it, you want to dance? - Okay. - Come on. We'll talk later. - Hey, fuck you, Bronk. (water splashing) - Hey, watch it, you big ape! - What's the matter, I get you wet? It looks like you have to take your top off now. (laughing) - Wouldn't you love that? - Ooh, you bet your sweet ass. Now, come on. What are you waiting for? - Hey, Bronk, why do you offer to play chef's hat with her? She loves that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Now, it's your turn. - No way, Jose. - Hey, hey! Weis, I'm gonna kill you! - All right, would everybody please rise while we raise the Chinese flag? - You're dead, (mumbles). You're dead! (soft pop music) - Hi, Artie. - Hi, Artie. - What's going on? ♪ Looks like a red balloon ♪ ♪ The radio is playing sexy tunes ♪ ♪ Oh baby, me and you ♪ - Hi, Artie. - Oh, hi. - Oh, listen, I'm sorry about the other night. - Oh yeah, I'm sorry about that too. - I'll make it up to you later. Let's dance, Artie. - Boyfriend trouble? - Is it that obvious? - Give me my pants! (people chanting) You're dead, you asshole! You're dead! Weis, I'm gonna kill you! ♪ The night so warm ♪ ♪ It fits like a glove ♪ ♪ And there's no time like now ♪ ♪ Making love ♪ (people applauding) (upbeat rock music) - Would you take me home please, Roger? (upbeat rock music) (people chanting) - Oh, below the belt. Ooh, below the belt again! - You're a dead man! That does it! (audience applauding) - Told you I'd get you, you little punk! A little water! - Let him up! Bronk, you son of a bitch! Let him up! (people chattering) - Can you swim? Can you swim, huh? Really funny now, aren't you? - Bronk, let him down! Bronk, come on! You can't do that! - Find it funny, you little asshole! (people chattering) - Bronk, don't drown him! Bronk! - You think that's funny, huh? - Let him up, you asshole! - Get down, get down! - Let him up! - Get down there! Get down, get down, get down! - Bronk? Where's Candy? Huh, where's Candy? Where's Candy? Where's Candy? - Candy. (upbeat rock music) Candy. Candy. Candy! (upbeat rock music) You and Weis are a couple of assholes! - Well? - I'm sorry, Roger. I'm so embarrassed by all this. - Look, just don't let it get you down. Personally, I think he's a jerk for letting you get away. - Thanks for being so nice. - Would you like to see me again? - I'd like to, but I'd better not. - I'd like to see you very much. Have you ever been to a music recording session? - No. - You doing anything Saturday? - No. - Would you like to go to one? - All right. - Good. Pick you up at noon. - Okay. I'd better go in now. - Okay. (romantic orchestral music) - Thanks for the lift! (romantic orchestral music) - Can you believe that about Monica and Roger? - [Female Speaker] I know. - [Female Speaker] You know what else happened that night? - BJ, why are you avoiding me? What's the matter?! - You have the nerve to ask me what's the matter? What's the matter with you? You're supposed to be my best friend, remember? - It's Roger. That's what this is all about? - Oh please don't give me the little innocent girl routine. You were supposed to be with Artie that night or didn't you get that straight? - Well apparently Artie didn't agree. - Oh, so you just latched onto Roger? How very convenient. - [Monica] He took me home. That's all. - Did he ask you out? - None of your business. - Well, good luck, prick tease. - You're bigger than I thought. - Boom Boom? - You didn't recognize me, did you? - What do you want? - Want to party. - [Bronk] With me? - You got it, big boy. - When? - [Boom Boom] Tonight. - You're on. You want to shower first? - I'm not dirty. - You better be. - No shit. - Mm-hmm. - You mean Candy asked you to the dance? (laughing) (vocalizing) Hey, whoa, wait, what about King Kong, huh? - Fuck him! - What about Monica? - What is this, 20 questions? - Well, I don't know, I don't know. It just seems like (mumbles) over with you two, I don't know. - Smart thinking, Einstein. Yeah, it's me and Candy now. God, I can still feel her pressing against me. - Hey, we're gonna double, right? - You wish. I'll have my own wheels by then. - Oh come on, I could chauffeur, keep the old hands free. (laughing) Want me to light that? - You're late. - Thought I'd better fortify myself a little. The scene with you could get a little hairy. - Thought you're an athlete. - Second favorite sport. (can crumpling) Your name really Boom Boom? - Your name really Bronk? - Are you for real? - What do you think? (soft jazz music) (moaning) (urine streaming) (Bronk burping) - All right, get out. (mumbles) - I'm not letting you outta my sight. - Listen, get out! Out! Out the door. Hey, thanks for breaking my fucking seat. (engine revving) (somber jazz music) - Charming.

You know, I've been telling Artie for a year that they were meant for each other, but no, he wouldn't listen to me. I said, Artie, you gotta have patience with this girl, but all he thinks about is sex. You know, if a girl doesn't put out with Artie on the first day right away, you know, he's not interested in it. But there they go, sure enough. I knew it. I knew it all along. Maybe now, he'll listen to me more. What do you think? - Peckerhead. (soft pop music) - Boy, what a night, huh? - It's probably the best night of my life. - Monica, I want to apologize for everything. I want you to know that. And Candy was just... Candy was...
