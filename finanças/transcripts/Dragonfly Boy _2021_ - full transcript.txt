[DAHLIA] Don't you look great? [GRAHAM] I didn't expect any guests this morning. [DAHLIA] Is that girl still here? [GRAHAM] What girl? [DAHLIA] The one you were absolutely devouring last night in front of everybody. [GRAHAM] Grace? Yeah, I know...ah... she left last night. [DAHLIA] It seems like you guys had a lot of fun [GRAHAM] Yeah... [DAHLIA] What are you doing today? [GRAHAM] Uhm... other than recovering from this hangover, nothing. [DAHLIA] Do you want to have lunch? [GRAHAM]Oh...okay, okay, yeah [DAHLIA] Perfect go cover your nips, we're leaving in five. [GRAHAM] All right So how'd you meet Grace? [GRAHAM] Uhm...not too long ago actually. Uhm...Alice, one of her friends was having a pool party and uhm...she was there. and we hung out, we started talking, she's really cool, I like her... ...uhm...yeah, yeah, we've hung out a few times since then, including last night. [DAHLIA] Is that why you were so nervous? [GRAHAM] Yeah, I don't know why I get so nervous... like... [DAHLIA] It's young love, it's beautiful, but she is super attractive though, so that's a plus. [GRAHAM] Yeah she is, totally. How about you? You got anyone? [DAHLIA] Slow down, this isn't a date if that's what you're thinking, but no. I'm too good for this town. Men are fucking useless, no offense. [GRAHAM] None, none taken. [DAHLIA] Yeah, I'll worry about that another time. For right now, they're just fun to play with. One day I'll move out to Paris and I'll live in a beautiful apartment with a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower and I'll sit out there in the mornings so I'll watch the sunrise, I'll drink tea, eat incredible food that I'll post every day to make my haters rage and maybe I'll meet some nice French guy named Pierre, Remy. [GRAHAM] Like the rat? [DAHLIA] It's my dream life, not yours [GRAHAM] Sorry...sorry [DAHLIA] But this guy is gonna be perfect, nothing less. He'll come over every day and we turn on the radio and listen to some oldies and dance in the kitchen like we're the only two left in the world. We'll never get sick of hearing each other's stories about what happened that day or what we're going to do the next day because with each other looking into each other's eyes that's the only place we want to be. [GRAHAM[ That's, you know, that's amazing. [DAHLIA] I know, thanks. [DAHLIA] Okay we should do this again you're fine. [GRAHAM] I agree [DAHLIA] All right, I'll see you soon [GRAHAM] See you Dahlia! - Are you seriously still dying in bed? [ALICE] What the hell are you on this morning? Usually you're dying right next to me and then we play rock, paper scissors, shoot and you make me mimosas. - Well, Dahlia came by earlier, she forgot her coat or something and then we went out and got some food. [ALICE] That's cute. What did you guys talk about? [GRAHAM] Just things, stuff. stuff [ALICE] Okay fine. Don't tell me [GRAHAM] Are you seriously getting offended? [ALICE] Please leave a message for Alice after the beep. Beep. - How long do we have to stay there? [ALICE] Forever, we're moving. Seriously though, if you keep complaining about this party i'm going to get your ass [GRAHAM] I know, I know. I just don't know anybody there [ALICE] Jackson's going [GRAHAM] No, no, no, not bug collector Jackson JESS] He's the kid who brought the bug to class last year [[GRAHAM] oh absolutely not [ALICE] You're gonna be fine champ [GRAHAM] You know if he brings abug i swear to God I'm leaving. I'm going to. [GRAHAM] So why isn't Cassie coming anymore? [JESS] I guess she's on some boat with this guy she just met [ALICE] Ooh [JESS] You know what they say about the summer time [ALICE] Oh yeah, I mean if a guy has a boat you gotta go. I don't blame her one bit [JESS] Oh absolutely. A man with a boat I hope he's the one [ALICE] I mean, if he's got a boat, he is the one. Remember the time that Cassie used tip off the side of the boat last year [JESS] Yeah she's always a fool making a straight up fool of herself Maybe we'll find you the one today Graham, who knows? [ALICE] Oh yeah all the pretty babes in bikinis, find your soulmate. [JESS] Jackson for one? - What are you doing? Are you actually sleeping right now. We are at a party and you're asleep. - No, no - Get up Graham, get up! - Noooooo [GRAHAM] Hey [JESS] Hi [GRAHAM] Do you want to get going soon? [JESS] Right now? [GRAHAM] I mean like now [JESS] I'm having fun, just a little longer? [GRAHAM] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [JESS] All right, okay - Okay [GRACE] Watch out! I'm so sorry [GRAHAM] It's fine, I think I'll survive. - I'm Grace - I'm Graham [GRACE] Wait, are you serious? [GRAHAM] You heard me. [GRACE] You really gave the entire team chickenpox totally sabotaging any chance at the championship? [GRAHAM] Yep [GRACE] That is incredible. [GRAHAM] Yeah [GRACE] You're pretty cool Graham. [GRAHAM] You are too. [ALICE] Graham, mama's drunk and I wanna go. [GRAHAM] Yeah, Yeah. That...that's my cue. [GRACE] Will I see you again? [GRAHAM] Yeah, I can make that happen. [ALICE] Yep, and you're driving. [GRAHAM] Here we go. Goodnight Alice. [ALICE] *mumbles* Goodnight. - So is Dahlia coming or what? [GRAHAM] No, no. I don't think so. - Where's the dragonfly bracelet i got you? I made you? [GRAHAM] I lost it. I don't know, it desappeared... [ALICE] You lost it? [GRAHAM] I obviously... [ALICE] You don't know? I spent like 50 hours... Hey, hey what's up? [JESS] Just got back from my new tattoo appointment [ALICE] Oh shit, look at that [CASSIE] It's really so pretty [JESS] Thank you so much [CASSIE] I like it [ALICE] Why the dragonfly? [JESS] Well you know my cousin Connor, he's like going through a hard time right now and we just kind of talked about like the dragonfly and how transformative it is and that really resonates with me and so we scheduled these appointments then, you know [GRAHAM] Wow!! [ALICE] That, it looks cool right [JESS] Yeah and it looks pretty cool [CASSIE] Graham I heard you hung out with Dahlia the other day [GRAHAM] Yeah she she got me so hungover... I was dead, I was... [CASSIE] I love her, she's so sweet, you're gonna get along so well with her.. [GRAHAM] Yeah... [DAHLIA] So how's grace? [GRAHAM] Uhm... I haven't seen her since the party [DAHLIA] Why's that? [GRAHAM] I don't know. I've been busy. [DAHLIA] Busy? Busy with what? You're 21, this isn't the time to be busy. What's up? Okay, all right. Come on! Come on! Ever since I was in high school, it's always been my favorite thing to just come down to the ocean and admire how big the world is around me. For a moment i feel so infinite yet so small. At the same time all my thoughts and my anxieties just seem to be absorbed by the ocean and the sky and I like go. [SCREAMS] [GRAHAM] Whoa whoa what the what the hell is that? [DAHLIA] Try it! [GRAHAM] Screaming? [DAHLIA] Yes, try it! [GRAHAM] You wanna me scream? [DAHLIA] Yes, try it! [BOTH SCREAMING] [DAHLIA] What did you feel like when you met Grace? [GRAHAM] What do you mean? [DAHLIA] Like how did you know? [GRAHAM] It was that night at the pool. I don't know we were talking and sitting on the edge, she kept getting closer and we kissed [DAHLIA] No way! [GRAHAM] Yeah, but I...uhm...I didn't feel any different. [DAHLIA] What do you mean? - You know when people tell you about something you haven't experienced yet, a feeling you haven't experienced yet or something you look forward to it so much, but when it finally happens it's totally underwhelming and the opposite of what you expected it to feel like. That was when we kissed I expected all the universe's questions to be answered then and to understand everything. - Maybe she isn't the one. - Or maybe she can't be. When i was 13, my mom told me it was just puberty. She said don't worry Graham, go to bed, they're just bad thoughts, they'll be gone in the morning... but they never were. It's been eight years and they still haven't. I used to look in the mirror and the boy staring at me would be terrified. I saw a boy, and on the outside he was just like any other boy, but... but he knew really, when really looked into his eyes, really saw who he was, he couldn't figure out how, he couldn't figure out why he was different. He couldn't accept himself, he yearned for the validation of others, struggled to find the right girl and when he finally met one, he thought she would have all the answers, she would be the one... she would be the one that would help everything make sense, she would...she would be the one to make the struggle worth it. But she wasn't. She couldn't be, she could never be the one. [DAHLIA] What are you saying Graham? [GRAHAM] I'm saying I'm terrified. [DAHLIA] Why? [GRAHAM] Because I'm scared of who I am. [DAHLIA] Or are you afraid that you can finally be who you are? [GRAHAM] What if i don't want, what if i don't want this? I just don't know what. I...I just don't know what I want. I'm waiting for someone to give me the answers, anything and... nobody's giving me the right answers. [DAHLIA] That's because no one can figure out who you are except for you. You have to find out for yourself. You know who you are but, when it's your time, you can tell the world or you don't. Who cares how long it takes you to figure it out. [GRAHAM] When will I know? [DAHLIA] As soon as you're ready to accept the love you deserve. My thing is: life is short. Allow yourself to feel, allow yourself to get hurt and be confused. You're human, but never be discouraged by the hurt. It takes some people a lifetime to figure out who they are, where they're going and who they want to take with them. Life is weird, you just gotta let yourself love. I hate this country, its culture. People sticker label after label to their bodies, to their brains, until they completely suffocate the real-life person underneath. Labels mean nothing, they're just a way to generalize. We're so obsessed with fitting in that we forget that people are never one-dimensional. You shouldn't have to define yourself, you should just be allowed to be. In our crazy messed up world, if you're different, you just have to tell everyone. [GRAHAM[ I just don't know if I'm ready. [DAHLIA] I'm not saying you have to announce it, let alone even know yourself, but for people like Grace make sure not anyone get hurt. Every day I wake up and look at myself in the mirror and think if I died today would I be happy with how I lived? Did I live authentically? Your heart's going to die one day Graham, but your soul will live on. And you nor anyone else won't ever be able to touch or love your body ever again. Be free and enjoy it while you can, it's your only one. [ALICE - VOICEMAIL] Hey Graham I'm not home right now because I'm currently with Cassie grabbing some last minute things for tonight. I completely forgot that we moved Jess's birthday celebration to this weekend  and not next weekend. So hopefully your suit is ready. Her and her cousin are coming over at like six so if you could please, please, please, please clean the kitchen so i don't start stress vomiting, that'd be great. All right, thank you, so much. Cassie and I'll be there ASAP, okay, bye. [FLY ME TO THE MOON by BOBBY WOMACK] [♪ Fly me ♪ Fly me to the moon ♪ And let me play among the stars ♪ Let me see ♪ Oh I wanna see what spring is like ♪ On Jupiter ♪ On Jupiter and Mars ♪ In other words, hold my hand ♪] [ALICE] All the balloons popped.

[CONNOR] Graham you did a really good job with this chicken. [GRAHAM] Thank you, I, what? Was cooking it for like two, three hours? [ALICE] Okay that's a lie. [GRAHAM] What? [ALICE] You know you bought that chicken from Hannaford's [GRAHAM] Oh my...yes. I physically bought the chicken from Hannaford's, that's true but like..I...I... [ALICE] The receipt says cooked. [GRAHAM] All right. [CONNOR] Wait, so how did you guys meet? [JESS] Uhm...bio right? [GRAHAM] Yeah what bio 100 [Connor] Freshman year... [JESS] Freshman year.Yeah Cassie was in the class too [Connor] Oh really? [CASSIE] Yeah, we all had it together. [JESS] You know I've known Cass for like ever [CONNOR] Yeah I know. I live where Graham he busted his ass in flame. It's so funny [ALICE] Is that why you came home the other day crying? [GRAHAM] Oh my god i wasn't crying but yes it was really nice he helped me, you know...I...I... [ALICE] With your booboo [GRAHAM] Oh. my god! [ALICE] Ah Jess, so for your 21st, you're actually 21st, we should go to that bar on the main street? [Jess] Yeah [CONNOR] O-hop right? Great! [ALICE] Yes, yes! oh my god! Yeah! Do you remember...yes when you get..ah, ah... this girl got so drunk, her boyfriend had to drag her ass off the bar because she was dancing so much... [JESS] You remember that, Cass? [CASSIE] Not really. [CONNOR] Blacked out? [CASSIE] Yep. [CONNOR] Been there before. [ALICE] How's your boyfriend, Jess? [JESS] Uhm... he's, something but not as bad as this one's ex-boyfriend, let me tell you [CONNOR] Yeah, yeah. My ex-boyfriend almost... uhm... ran me over with the bus one time so... - Wow... [GRAHAM] What? [CONNOR] Yeah he's a bus driver so... [ALICE] A bus driver? He's a bus driver? [ALL TOGETHER] Red flag. [ALICE] Connor, you have to come out with us next time! [CASSIE] We have to go to a gay bar! [JESS] No, I know the perfect place. [CONNOR] Really [JESS] Yeah [ALICE] We could hook him up with someone! [CONNOR] Yeah I'm just kind of waiting for the right one, you know [ALICE] No, you just need a hook up [CONNOR] Yeah you're right [CASSIE] Oh yeah, there's going to be tons of guys there [ALICE] Oh, yeah. [CASSIE] Like you're going to find the right man [Connor] Really? [ALICE] Dude they're so hot, it's honestly unfair. Like they're so hot like. [CONNOR] Yeah, no, I've never been to a gay bar before so. [ALICE] What? How have he and you haven't? Oh my god. [CONNOR] Hey. [GRAHAM] Hey. [CONNOR] How are you? [GRAHAM] I'm pretty good, how are you? [CONNOR] Good The stars are a beautiful thing, aren't they? [GRAHAM] Yeah, they're little dots away that people use to connect and make shapes and images it's...uhm... it's beautiful. [CONNOR] The human mind is a beautiful thing too isn't it? [GRAHAM] Yeah [CONNOR] People get so lost in themselves, lost in their lives that they forget we can just take a step back and look at the stars and realize how small we really are, how insignificant everything is. It's so easy not to follow your heart, lose sight of who we are, to forget what it's like to be blissfully and brutally human but we don't even allow ourselves to be happy. [GRAHAM] Are you happy? [CONNOR] I try to do everything i can to be happy and to feel alive but not everyone agrees with it but life's too short right? [GRAHAM] Right. [ALICE] Graham, you gotta come join the actual party and we're...forget it... [CONNOR] Hey do you need help with any of the dishes or anything? [GRAHAM] Oh no, no.I think i'm all good [CONNOR] Also...uhm...do you know where the girls coats are? [GRAHAM] Umm...they're up on the third floor and... uhm... it's like the first room [CONNOR] Do you mind just helping me? [GRAHAM] Sure, yeah okay, okay. [CONNOR] Where are they? [GRAHAM] Right over there. [CONNOR] Over here? [GRAHAM] Yep [CONNOR] A dragonfly pendant? [GRAHAM] Yeah, my mom gave it to me, when i was nine. That's when she gave it to me after my grandma passed away [CONNOR] I'm sorry [GRAHAM] The dragonfly is a family symbol. That was my grandma's favorite creature and we just kind of adopted it. As I've grown up I've seen dragonflies everywhere: on my way to school, concerts, baseball games, it's just nice, she's always looking down on me [CONNOR] Yeah, she's always protecting you. [GRAHAM] Yeah, exactly. [CONNOR] That's beautiful... You know  the dragonfly also means transformation. You're like a dragonfly, you attract positive change On the inside of you, dancing with you you are capable of loving and capable of living, but it's the moment you allow yourself to dance on the outside, it's the moment you grow wings [GRAHAM] What if, what if what's on the inside is scary, scarier than living a lie? [CONNOR] You're supposed to be scared, you're human. Are you afraid of me? [GRAHAM] That's what I keep telling myself. [CONNOR] Oh. I should go. [GRAHAM] Yeah. [DAHLIA] So how did you know? [GRAHAM] Since the seventh grade. I started getting these really intrusive thoughts, you know like... it was normal. I grew up listening to what other people were saying and I knew it was a part of life but what i didn't realize was that the other boys had different thoughts. I just thought everyone was like me. But when i truly knew It was the day i fell in love. His name is Peter. We had been best friends since second grade, we did everything together: we played video games, we talked for hours about everything and nothing at the same time; you couldn't, you couldn't separate us. Around junior year is when I started to recognize my feelings and I knew that I wanted us to be more than friends, more than best friends and I put myself into this cycle of self-loathing and it took me, it took me years to get out of it. I'll always remember how hard I...I fell for him and how...how much i truly loved him and him and his girlfriend are so adorable but I'm jealous, and I'm not jealous of them you know, it's... it's that mutual love that they have for each other, it's just... I'll always remember how he made me feel. He...he was in my life for a reason He helped me discover a part of myself and...and I'll forever be thankful for that. [DAHLIA] You're a beautiful human Graham. You deserve all the love that you gave the world right back to you. [DAHLIA] Oh shit! [GRAHAM] What? [DAHLIA] Oh shit! I forgot I had a date, I completely forgot, oh my god! Oh my god! Can we, I'm so sorry, can you take me back to my house? [GRAHAM] Yeah, yeah, yeah [DAHLIA] God...I have no idea what... Can you help me get ready, I have no idea what i'm wearing [GRAHAM] Sure, yeah, sure [DAHLIA] Thank you, oh my god oh my god. [DAHLIA] Graham, what do I even wear to this date? [GRAHAM] I don't know [DAHLIA] Should I wear a dress? [GRAHAM] No, that way is too formal [DAHLIA] Really? [GRAHAM] Yeah [DAHLIA] Do you think it's too formal...uhm...what jeans?

Which one should I wear? [GRAHAM] Uhm...that one [DAHLIA] This one, yeah okay Why did you ask? [GRAHAM] Uuhhmmm... Can...can i try? [DAHLIA] What?

After I dropped off the girls I came back home and my dad  was waiting up for me and next to his feet were bags of all my things. He basically told me that I was a disappointment and an embarrassment and that I'm no longer his son so... I can't go back. [GRAHAM] Connor... I'm so sorry. I just... Do you have anywhere to stay? [CONNOR] Yeah uhm, I've been staying with Jess on her floor but I can't burden her about further, so... I have some family on the west coast... umm...that I'm probably gonna stay with. I... I'm trying to figure it out but... uhm...I've been meaning to go for a while, so... [GRAHAM] That's bullshit! He's your dad he shouldn't have the right to kick his own son out It's...It's..just everything you've been through just because you're... [CONNOR] Gay. I know he probably thinks I'm the devil. [GRAHAM] Let me grab up your towel, okay? [CONNOR] I used to ask myself that question constantly: Who am I? I spent all the time expecting other people to answer that question for me and I... I never thought that I'd be able to solve my own problems, answer my own questions but now I just listen to my heart and let it guide me. Life's a lot more fun that way. It's... It's funny how much you learn about yourself when you listen to your heart, discover more things about yourself. [GRAHAM] I...I try listening to myself my heart tells me one thing and my mind tells me other and I never know which one to listen to. How do you know which one is right? [CONNOR] I listen to my heart. My mind is like this massive knot of billions of like thoughts and opinions and ideas but people can and will control your mind and play with it, but you can always choose to listen to your heart. You know? [GRAHAM] Yes [CONNOR] Your heart knows when you're happy, when you're sad, when you're scared when you're nervous or when you're excited. That's why heartbreak is one of the worst feelings to go through and when I wasn't accepting who I was, that's exactly how I felt. I had this horrible feeling in my heart every single day because I was something I thought this world would rather get rid of than keep, some freak accident, at least that's how my dad felt, but I used to always question is it worth it? Is this gonna get better? And... questioned if i even knew what i was doing but the night when we kissed everything made sense. You felt like a hand that wiped away all the tears that I ever cried it felt like you took away all the bruises and wounds from my life and cherished them because in that moment it gave me hope. I knew it was gonna be worth it when I knew.

Uhm...I just wanted to say thank you for everything You already gave me my answer the other night but... but last night you gave me hope again so... I'm probably not gonna see you for a bit but... I hope that you're finding yourself, so... Take care. Hey Alice it's Dahlia. Hey...uhm...can you just tell Graham to call me back? Oh gotcha, okay. Yeah sorry, thanks, bye. [ALICE] Hey, are you good? [GRAHAM] Yeah, I'm fine. [ALICE] You know you can always talk to me, right? [GRAHAM] Yep. [ALICE] Ok. Well, I'm just across the hall. [DAHLIA] What are you fucking doing? Why have you been ignoring me? [GRAHAM] I've been busy. [DAHLIA] Busy with what? [GRAHAM] Stuff. [DAHLIA] What are you not telling me Graham? [GRAHAM] Nothing, I don't know what you're talking about. [DAHLIA] Don't be shit with me Graham. You can't just throw me away after we've been hanging out every single day and there is nothing wrong. [GRAHAM] I don't see what the issue is [DAHLIA] Then why did you tell Alice to tell me that you flew home this weekend to see your family? [GRAHAM] Because I needed a fucking break, okay? [DAHLIA] A break from what? [GRAHAM] From you inside my head! I feel like I'm going crazy [DAHLIA] What am I getting in your head about? [GRAHAM] You know exactly what you're getting in my head about this fucking gay shit You're asking so many questions. I just need a moment to think. [DAHLIA] I'm sorry that I've just been listening to you and trying to give you advice. [GRAHAM] You know what? Your advice is shit [DAHLIA] The fuck Graham [GRAHAM] Just, just go Dahlia. [DAHLIA] No, no I'm not going, why would I ? I'm not gonna go! We've been hanging out every single day I've been trying to help you [GRAHAM] I know, I know I'm just trying to get a moment to myself, I'm trying to get away from everything. [DAHLIA] But why? Haven't you just... [GRAHAM] Because I'm scared, Dahlia, I'm scared. For 21 years I've been living a lie and..and and I see myself changing into a different person and I'm scared. I've built up this barrier and it makes me feel safe but I can feel myself dying from the inside out. Do you know how difficult it is telling people who you really are? It shouldn't matter but it does. And I appreciate you so much for helping me find myself, but i can't fall asleep every night because I  i know I'm not...I know i'm not normal. [DAHLIA] But you aren't normal, Graham! Who the fuck wants to be normal? There's eight billion people on this wasteful, fucking planet but only one  of you. There's no other Graham with your smile and your personality and...and your passion for life and the world. Nobody gives the same love that you do. You're so special and unique, you're so beautiful. [GRAHAM] Why don't I feel it then? I've been thinking all my questions are getting answered but they aren't and, and, and I'm fucking tired of it. [DAHLIA] Because you're a human, you're learning how to love yourself unconditionally. Your whole life people have told you who you are and who you're supposed to love but you're the only one who knows who you truly are. I love you Graham and so does Alice and Jess, and Cassie, and everybody who's ever had the pleasure of meeting you. I think I can speak for all of us when I say that the Graham that we know is an incredible, amazing, caring friend and we're all so grateful for you and wish you nothing but the best and we wish for nothing less of you feeling comfortable in your own skin and being the truest, the best version of yourself. There's only one life, why waste such a precious gift by holding yourself back from it? [GRAHAM] His name is Connor. He was the person I was waiting for at the party. I've liked, I've had feelings for other boys before, you know the ones I used to just brush away but he was different. He welcomed me and everything I was or, at that moment, everything I wanted to be. [DAKLIA] Do you still talk to him [GRAHAM] His dad kicked him out. The night he told me was actually the last time I saw him and that night we slept with each other. I was terrified at first but almost felt like the universe wrapped its arms around me and told me it was gonna be okay. For the first time I was able to like fully, for the first time I was able to breathe. I thought it was just a stupid one-night thing and my life would go right back on track to being normal but...but now it all makes sense. God all the time I've wasted. [DAHLIA] You didn't waste any time Graham. I remember like it was just yesterday: me and my little brother used to go out to that lighthouse over there and he used to think that the little light on the top was a U.F.O. and I used to pretend to be an alien and chase him around until he got tired. [GRAHAM] So...uhm...what's your brother doing now? [DAHLIA] Uhm..He was five when we first found out that he was sick. We just thought it was a virus and then a month later, we were standing...standing in front of his grave. [GRAHAM] I'm so sorry [DAHLIA] It's okay, it's okay. It's just hard, you know, he'll never be able to fall in love with a girl or a boy, or even figure out which one. He'll never experience his first heartbreak and be able to have a family and raise kids of his own, but it helps me not take anything for granted because you never know when one day will be your last, so... you can't take anything for granted. Every second leading up to this point in our lives we were growing; You were challenged not only by the people in your life, but by yourself. Every day, whether you notice it or not, you were loving yourself more and more and eventually one day, when you love yourself the way that you deserve, you'll fly.

Come in... [GRAHAM] Hey. [ALICE] Hey [GRAHAM] Are you busy? [ALICE] Let me take a look at my very, very busy schedule... No, what's going on? [GRAHAM] You remember how I told you to tell Dahlia that I was going home this weekend? [ALICE] Yeah, what happened with that? [GRAHAM] Okay. I've just been thinking a lot, going through some shit, you know and...uhm...I don't like Grace as much as i thought I did. [ALICE] Okay, have you told her that? [GRAHAM] No, actually I'm gonna pick her up this afternoon...uhm...to talk to her. [ALICE] Okay...uhm...I thought things were going well. [GRAHAM] They are believe me, but... but... Alice you you've been my best friend since...for as long as i can remember. You see me at my best and my worst and I just, I never want to lose you. [ALICE] Graham you're never going to lose me. [GRAHAM] I know, I know. It's just I'm scared because of the person I am. [ALICE] Graham what's going on? [GRAHAM] Alice...I'm, I'm... I'm gay. [ALICE] Graham you're my best friend, I could never hate you, especially not for something like this. It's who you are. All I want is for you to be happy, you deserve to be you. I love you. . [GRAHAM] I love you too, Alice. [ALICE] Get off my room I'm gonna start crying. [GRACE] Hey, thanks for picking me up. [GRAHAM] Yeah of course. [GRACE] What did you want to talk about? [GRAHAM] Uhm...So i'm gonna be straight up with you. You're a wonderful person but I can't do this anymore, and it's something I've been battling with on the inside my whole life and especially over the past couple of months. I like men the way I'm supposed to like women. [GRACE] Ohh [GRAHAM] And I...I'm sorry for dragging you along through all this. It's...it's been so much. [GRACE] So the party meant nothing? [GRAHAM] No, no, no. That was an incredible evening That was. I just... You were kissing a different person... A lost person who's trying to find themselves. [GRACE] As much as this hurts I'm proud of you. [GRAHAM] What...? [GRACE] As much as anyone in my situation tries there's nothing we can do to change it, you nor I can change it. Falling in love is one of those things that makes life worth it. Taking that away from somebody just because the society tells them they're invalid, it's a waste. A waste of a beautiful heart capable of doing so much. Unfortunately, so many people live their lives never fully as themselves. They aren't happy, they marry the wrong person, they live an unfulfilled life. Graham I've only known you for a few months, but from the moment I met you I knew i wanted you to live an exceptionally happy life and even though I can't help you in that way I really hope you keep me along for the ride. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GRAHAM] Connor... [CONNOR] Hey, Graham. [DAHLIA] Uhm, Alice don't isn't there something we should be doing? [ALICE] Yeah, uhm...taxes, it's tax season. [GRAHAM] Do you wanna go for a walk? [CONNOR] Sure. [GRAHAM] So what are you doing back here? [CONNOR] I'm just here for Jess and my week of my work gave me a week off so... I just took advantage of it rolled with it. [GRAHAM] How long are you back for? [CONNOR] Until Tomorrow. I'm heading back soon so. [GRAHAM[ Well, how do you like the west coast? [CONNOR] So much better honestly. I found a job next to my apartment so it's been pretty convenient, but...hum ...it's a lot warmer than here. How are things with you? [GRAHAM] Pretty good actually, I mean... I've been busy. A lot of change I guess. [CONNOR] It looks like your knee is getting a lot better too. You seem a lot happier too. [GRAHAM] Yeah, I finally started finding myself. [GRAHAM] You know I never thanked you, Dahlia. [DAHLIA] Eh? I never thanked you for helping me. [DAHLIA] What did I help you with? [GRAHAM] You cared for me, you guided me, you helped pull me out of this messy place I am in my head You taught me that it's okay to be who I am and that i deserve to be happy, and for that, thank you. [DAHLIA] I appreciate the gratitude but I was only a small part. You had it in yourself the whole time. I just saw it but I was waiting for you to find it for yourself. I love you, Graham. You're a beautiful soul in a world that's now yours Love is such a powerful gift that we get to have. As people we deprive ourselves from this gift so much that we end up living unhappy lives, miserable with ourselves until we're completely burnt out. Then it's too late. And for some of us we're still trying to find out what love is. Maybe love is about taking care of yourself: your mind, your body, but especially, your heart. Maybe love shows up when you realize that the people who surround you are full of love to give back. Maybe love is about letting go of what destroys you and learning that regret is just a black hole that nobody ever wants to encounter. Maybe love is realizing that you don't deserve to. We're all put on this earth with the ability to take this love and make it into anything we want. At the end of the day, we're just people with beautiful emotions, all just trying to make our hearts fly.
