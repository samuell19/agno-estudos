Your work here isn't complicated. We open in the morning and close when everyone's gone. Monday to Friday, we close earlier, at, say, one or two... We stay open all night Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Okay. You can eat whatever you want. We turn the grill on at about 10, to pre-cook the meat. Are your papers in order? They're being done, sir. Good. You 'll be paid 15 pesos a day. - Plus tips. - Okay. Can you start tomorrow? - Of course, no problem. - That's great. There's a fight tomorrow, we'll have a full house. You 'll take care of the grill, Rosa will be here, but she gets crazy when there's too much work. Fast food sells best. Rosa works all day. If we need help, I'll call you. Like if I need you to make a coffee, or to wash a glass, right ? Tell me... - How long have you been here? - One week. "COOK WANTED" Did you learn to grill in Peru? No, I'm not Peruvian, I'm Bolivian. Here comes the Bolivian team, led by Julio C?sar Baldivieso. They're coming onto the field. Here is Baldivieso, who recently came to our country. All dressed in green ! Here comes the Argentinean team! With "Cholo" Simeone, "Flaco" Passet, Ayala, Ortega... Almeyda, Morales and Zanetti. Argentina is on the field. Argentina and Bolivia are competing live in a country-wide broadcast. They exchange banners in the mid-field. The Bolivian line-up... The Bolivians are kicking off. Echeverri... How daring of Cholo! The goalie fails to catch the ball! Argentina is wide awake! Ortega scores, attentive from the start! Amazing! Batistuta aims towards the Argentinean defenders. The goalie fails once again to catch the ball. - The Bolivian defense is weak. - Terrible! Good for Ayala. He was there and he moved, making the Bolivians desperate and disorganized. Take the first tray out now. Okay. You know, where the transvestite hookers are, on the corner of Charcas and Nicaragua Streets. Charcas and Nicaragua? They're parallel. Put the sausages on the grill now. Okay. They're in Palermo Viejo, you know where I mean? The area with Central American street names, like Peru. But Peru is in South America. I don 't understand. Bring me a coffee. Yes, sir. Why don 't you bring me the city map? The clock is ten minutes late. Reset it. Did you see your daughters? - They're doing great. - Really? They're fine. How's it going with your wife? It's okay. Really? Good. Remember the day I got drunk? - Yes, Tuesday. - How embarrassing! I went to confront her at home. I yelled : "Dump that asshole!" "Stop fucking him." What did she say? She blew me off. You idiot! Thanks. Anything else, sir? Not right now. Hello. Listen, Rosa... You start at 8, not when you feel like coming in. I overslept. When I have to pay the rent, I can 't give any excuses. And you get paid every day, whether you work or not. I don 't mind working late Saturdays and I don 't get overtime. But that was the deal. So, if you don 't like it, you know where the door is. All right. - Got it? - Yes. Now, go get everything together for the lunch rush. Hello. Two croissants and a coffee with milk. - Right away. - Thank you. - What's up? - How's it going? I didn 't think I'd see you. Give Marcelo a coffee with milk. - Got the time? - You got a watch. Yes, but it works like shit. There's one here. They fucked it up, I can't tell what time it is. It's 10:30. Take care of the tables. He's got the grill. Okay, and at lunchtime? - What about lunchtime? - What do we do? We'll do the same as always. Leaving already? No, not yet. I'm going to the car dealer at 11 :30. It took me 2 hours yesterday. Thanks. Is Rosita doing well? I saw her along the way, so I gave her a lift. They screwed me over yesterday. They said no. - They said no? - Yeah. I'll see if... I'll have to get a lawyer. I know one. I've got to hold on 'til the trial. I'll pay when I get the settlement. They're assholes! They're assholes, man ! Those Uruguayans are assholes. My old lady is Uruguayan. I go there a lot. But these are real assholes, man ! They'll gyp me. They're capable of anything. There are assholes everywhere, in the USA, in Russia... And even in Cuba. The ones that are fucking with me are Uruguayan. Cool down, it'll be all right. Yeah, it'll be okay. Cool, man ! Stay cool. Can I borrow your map? What for? To find a street in Palermo Viejo. It's in the car. I'll get it. - Want me to get it? - No, I will. I said I'd get it, so I'll get it. You have a great car but no maps, huh? Has anyone been hit yet? No, but it'll happen soon. I heard you got another car. They gave me a Duna. Cool, did you give yours back? Yeah, I don't owe any more money on it. If Oso finds out, he'll be pissed. Why, he's got problems? It's not easy for him. He's in trouble. - Still snorting? - A little bit. Sometimes. - Here, man. - Thanks. I'll give it back. He doesn't even have a map! I'm outta here. Okay. - Can I have the remote control? - Here. Thanks. Thank you very much. - Bye. - See you later. Are you coming to see the match tonight? It never starts on time. I might. - What's up? - Wash the cups! - Where's the remote? - Over there. - Can you make me a coffee? - No problem. Did you wash it? Are you okay? - Are you using that? - Yes, but you can have it. What are you selling? Not much... A little flashlight... Scissors... You could keep them in your taxi. I have some already. Do you have Post-its to stick on the window? I don 't have any left. - Here? - No, over there. - I'll bring it. - Thanks. I'll get some next week. Get two packs for me. I don 't have any left. Could I have some sugar? One more. Thanks. Oso... Should I put that on your tab? Yes please. Can I pay later? I'm in deep shit, I'm broke. You already owe me 200 pesos. Hey man, can you give me a light? I can give you... Here, 20 pesos to start with. I'll pay you as soon as I win my lawsuit. Yeah, but my patience has a limit. Stop fucking around, half-breed. Okay, no problem. Thanks, man. - Hey, Mr. Enrique... - What? The guy wants to pay yesterday's and today's bills. - What did he have? - A coffee. I'll bring him the bill. Listen... See those two guys there? If they don't order anything, tell them to leave. Tell them it's late. Sir... You'll have to leave if you don't order anything. Sir... You have to leave. Don't touch me, motherfucker! You have to leave. Don 't touch me, nigger! Son of a bitch ! Come on, nigger! Fucking nigger! - Come here! - Come on ! Pussy! This too? Yes, charge me for everything. Let's see... you owe 4.50... 28.40. Just give me 28 pesos. I'm going back to Cordoba next week. Really, again? I'm going to live with my mother. Why? There's nothing here, no work. Yeah, there's nothing, it's a disaster. So, you got a new employee? Why? Because I was looking for a job. You didn't tell me, how was I supposed to know? You shouldn't forget about your countrymen. I haven 't forgotten about my countrymen. Give me the rag. Is everything OK? Yeah, but there's a lot of work. Do you want to grab a bite? We'll eat later, when it's calmer. Okay. Is it always like this? Yeah, but it's worse when there's a game or a fight on TV. Take a break, go eat. Thanks, Freddy. You 're welcome. How long have you been working here? About a year. And how long have you been here, in Buenos Aires? My mother's Argentine, I was born in Paraguay. My father is Paraguayan. I came here about 4 years ago. And you, when did you come? I got here last week. My wife and my three little girls stayed over there. But I want to bring them here later on. Did you come alone? Yes. Life is hard over there. Things are hard here too, you know. It's not that great. Yes, but at least you can... eat and earn a living. Have you ever been here before? Never, and I never thought I'd come. I've wanted to leave ever since I got here. So why are you staying? When the other cook was here, we shared the tips from the tables and the counter. This is what I made from the tables today. I left the bill, is that okay? Fine. - What will it be? - A coffee. Mr. Enrique, can I take a break? I need five minutes to call home, is that okay with you? Sugar or sweetener? Sugar. Help yourself. Be quick, we have to cook for tonight's fight. Okay, Mr. Enrique. Can you give me a 10-peso advance? And you 'll pay me the rest tonight. Here... Where are you going to call from? Isn 't there a payphone here? No, go around the corner, straight ahead, and then turn right... 65 Junin Street... There's a guy, about 40, by the door... It's a house with a long hallway. Go all the way back. Drop my name, they'll give you a deal on the call. "Mr. Enrique"? Yeah, just go! Do you want to make a call? Yes, I'd like to call Bolivia. Can l? Wait a minute. The guy from the restaurant sent me. He gave me your address. Rodolfo! Yeah? He's going to call Peru. No, Bolivia, La Paz. How much do I owe you? Let's see, you owe me... 8 pesos. Don 't you have any change? - I'll be by the door. - Right. Here's your change. See you later. Where did you say you were calling? Bolivia, La Paz. Write down the number. Here it is. Wait there. The phone will ring. The thing is... I only have ten pesos. Could you tell me about how long I can talk? How long can I talk? About 5 minutes, I'll tell you when. - Should I wait? - Wait a minute, I'll dial. Okay. Do I answer? - It's for you, man. Pick it up. - Okay. Anita, how are you? It's me, Freddy, calling from Buenos Aires! I'm doing all right. How is everyone there? Yes, I'm working in a restaurant. Tell everyone I'm working in a restaurant. Listen, I don 't have a lot of time, and I don 't have much money. Yes, I want to talk to Fanny... And to my babies. Please hurry. Sweetie pie! How are you, Anita? My sugar plum! How are you? Are you doing your homework? Are you being a bad girl? Fine... Yes... I got presents for you. I'll bring them to you when we see each other. Put mommy on the phone. I'm being a good boy. Be a good girl. Give me your mom. Hurry up! Quick, quick! Fanny, how are you? You're worried? No, don't worry, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm working now. In a restaurant. I'm working in a restaurant, as a cook. Please, don 't cry, I'm fine. In a restaurant, as a cook. I'm living in a hotel. It's not too expensive. Tyson and Holyfield are in the ring. They're staring each other down. They're waiting for the bell to ring. The fight is about to begin. Live from Las Vegas, the ultimate fight for the end of this century. An upper-cut from Holyfield and Tyson goes down ! Oso, how's it going? So-so. What's up with you? I'm in deep shit. What's wrong? Remember when I fought with my wife? Her lawyer is keeping me away from my girls. Still the same old story? Give it a rest. It's the only thing you got, man... your kids. - Can I wash my hands? - Yes, sorry. And what's up with your car? I'm fucked. They're gonna screw me. - Really? - Yeah. I don't know what to do. They screwed you over? They got me, man. I don 't know. How did you get your car? Remember my old R12? I changed it right away. I owed a couple of payments to those gypsies from Liniers... But nothing happened. Everything's okay. - Do you get along with those guys? - Yeah. Will you come with me to see what we can do? Come on, we'll talk. Go ahead. I'll be right there. Make me a sausage sandwich. Who is it for? - For Oso. - Don 't make it. Okay. - How much is it? - What did you have? Five pesos. Enrique told me not to make you one. Do you have any sandwiches left? Why did Rosa tell me that there weren't any left? Make me one, okay? Didn't I tell you not to make him one? You told Rosa. I'm telling you now : don't make him one. Okay, cool. What's up with that, Enrique? We agreed that I could pay Monday. I have that down, but Marcelo has to pay. And that's it for today. Did I ever refuse to pay? Listen, you 've got your problems, and I've got mine. Why do you tell your staff not to serve me? Why don 't you ask me for the food? Okay, man. How much is a sandwich? - One peso. - Tell your cook to make me one. Okay, make him one. Make it well-done. Are you deaf or just stupid? I said "well-done"! I said okay. What are you mumbling? I was taught to ask for things politely. What are you saying? That you should ask politely and with respect. Politely and with respect... Here's what I owe. You need a lift? No, that's okay. I'm going to Ramos Mejia, do you want to come? No thanks, another time. Bye, Freddy! Here... Here's the rest of your pay : 5 pesos. - See you tomorrow at 7. - Okay. Hello, sir. Police! Against the wall! Put your bag on the ground. Search it! - You were...? - Nearby. Turn around. Unzip your jacket. So, where are you coming from? Nearby. - Where? - Nearby. Nearby where? About 3 blocks away. What are you doing here? Just passing by. Where to? To see a relative. Just visiting. Turn around! Where are your papers? - Here are my immigration papers. - What's this? Is this your l.D.? Yes, this is my l.D. Freddy... Do you work? You can't work if you're not legal. You know you could go to jail if you do. - Are you on vacation? - No, just visiting family. Speak slowly and clearly. I'm just passing through. Where to? I just came to see a relative. - What the fuck is in there? - Not much. If I see you again, I'll throw you in jail. - Got it? - Got it. Hello. Can I have a coffee, please? - How much is it? - One peso. Here you go. Thanks. Damn, check out her tits, man ! They're huge! Not as nice as the Paraguayan's. Don't say that. I'm in deep shit with this taxi thing. And the fucking lawyer said I won't get the money till next month. That's the corner of Talcahuano and Santa Fe. It's the Cosmos Hotel on Constitucion. Those Yankees are such assholes! For them, the bad guys are always Latinos, Blacks, Tahitians... Whatever! You could be one too, you know. But they're right. The guys who go to the States are all strapped for cash. They're starving. It's not like it is here, man. Any asshole can come here and make quick money. - Have you ever? - No, only the foreigners can. We work like dogs all day long, and we're still broke. Do you have it? - No, you do. - I do? Leave some for me. Can I give you a lift to the hotel? I don 't know. Are you tired? No, I might go dancing. Do you wanna go for a drive? I don 't know. Okay, go eat. What are you doing? Don 't you think this film sucks? You don't like it 'cause you're a fag. Take care of the kid, Mercado. Switch back to the other channel. What? Good thing you're going back to your village. Turn up the volume! - Stop bugging him. - Here comes the boyfriend... Don't talk so loud. What are you drinking? A soda. Do you want me to get you a red wine? Okay. The food's ready. The salesman has a crush on you. What? The salesman... What about him? He's a fag. I don 't think he is. I hear he's going out with the taxi driver, Mercado. Are you ready to pay? Yeah. I don 't want any trouble. - What? - You know exactly what I mean. I don 't want any trouble in here. What do you mean? Do what you like outside, but this is a restaurant. If you stare at the staff, they get nervous. I didn 't do anything. Good. That'll be 5 pesos. Make sure you get your share. Who do you live with here? I live in a hotel. Where? Not far from here. I need to find another one. It's expensive here. And there are always problems with the cops. My hotel costs 8 pesos. Is it far from here? If we take the 96 bus, we'll be there in 10 minutes. - Bye, Enrique, thanks. - Leave the door open. Beware of her. I mean it. We're not taking this one? It's full, we'll take the next one. I'll leave, if you want, if you have things to do. I never go dancing alone. Do you need a lift? No, I'm tired tonight. I thought you wanted to go dancing. No. I'm going to the hotel. I'm really tired. You don't want to, or you have other plans? No, I just have to take him to the hotel. Give him the address, we'll meet him there. I'd rather take the bus. You're not mad, are you? What's it to you? We'll go for a ride and come back for him later. I'd rather take the bus. Does that bother you? See you. What did you say? Are we going soon? Wait 'til I finish up, and we'll leave. What did you do in Bolivia? What did I do? I worked in the fields, with a combine harvester. Why did you come here? Because I worked picking coca, picking fruit. Then, the Yankees came and they burnt everything down. They burnt the fields? Yes, they burnt everything. What are you doing? - This doesn't work. - It works! - No, it doesn't. - Stop it! Leave it alone! It works! What do you want? Are you looking for trouble? - Okay. - Stop hitting it. Okay, it works, but fix it anyway. Forget it. It's late. Be quiet, there are people here. Okay. Hold this, and my bag. And the 2 pesos? You 're asking me about the 2 pesos? You 're the one who brought me here. You should ask the doorman, not me. Who is that stupid doorman? Probably just an asshole! No, he's a good guy. I know him. Stop! You're a married man. You shouldn't kiss me! Didn't you say you liked married men? Think of your daughters. My daughters are sleeping. And I miss them. Wait, I have to find the room. Why not here? Stop, I have to find the room. Hold this. I have to find the room. It's not this one. Where is it? He said it had a blue door. See, you're lost. Come here. Let's go to your room. What room? Why don't we go to yours? We can't go to mine, my friend is there. I live with friends. With your girlfriends? We could have a party. So, now you want to meet my friends too? Why not? Wouldn't you like that? Shit, they're not the same batteries. Did you change the batteries, Rosa? It's about time you changed them. The clock doesn't work. Is your friend coming today? He went to the car dealer to see if he could have a few more weeks. He owes me almost 100 pesos. He owes 400 on his car. They're going to repossess it. On top of it, he has to move because he can 't pay the rent. Is he coming here? He has to go see the Turk. How is the Turk doing? He's making money, just like us. He remembers you owe him money. Here's the money. - He didn't have change? - No. Did you go dancing last night? No, I told you I was too tired. I thought I saw you at the Bolivian hangout last night. You were mistaken. And I'm Paraguayan. Here, take this. Leave that alone. You don 't know anything about it. Go to the grill. Holy shit! Are these people stupid or what? They're a bit slow. I think that they just play dumb. But if we're not careful, they'll become our bosses. I don't know, man, shoot myself or somebody else, you know? - Stop it! - Bring another one. I just hope that the Turk's there. I told him we're coming. He's expecting us. Keep cool. That fucking Uruguayan... You know what he said? That I should thank him for waiting a month to be paid. They're taking the bread out of our mouths! Don't let it get to you. There's so much misery here! So much misery! We open our doors, they come here to work... How can that be? It's warm. I can 't drink this. I'll bring you another. Calm down, man. Easy for you to say. I'll give you a hand. I'll try to talk to that guy. That won 't help me. Do you want to try it? Were you hiding it? Colder, man ! Don 't you have a cold one? I can bring ice cubes, if you want. Ice cubes? That's okay, pour it anyway. - Sorry, man. - It's okay. You two have had enough beer. Don 't worry, let him drown his sorrows. Drink, if you want to, but not too much. That's not very nice of you. He helped you out when you needed it, remember? He owes me enough as it is. What's up? How are you, Hector? Did you see Mercado, that fatso? I haven 't seen him for a few days. He's having problems with his wife, they're getting divorced. He's got a big mouth. He said he'd come with me to see the gypsies about the car. He fucked me over. I saw him the other day. He hangs out in the Gallego's bar. I saw him from the bus. Do you still have problems with your car? I'm in deep shit, man ! I need a miracle... If only money grew on trees or even fell from the sky... He left you on your own too, huh ? He tries to pass himself off as a nice guy. He wags his tail and then he bites you. Isn 't everyone like that in Buenos Aires? Don 't worry about it. If you see him, tell him I said he's a great guy. Can I take this away? Yes, wait a minute. Marcelo, can you do me a favor, man? If I can, I will. I owe fatso some money. You understand? He wants it back. He wants his money back. Can you lend me some cash? We'll see if he stops bothering me. Like I said, I've got my hearing next week. I only have 50 pesos on me, I've got to pay my rent for the taxi. I don 't want to be stingy, or anything... It's on me. I'm paying tonight. It's okay. Thanks, man. Let's have another round. One for the road! Hey you ! Give me a cold beer, this time. Pay me now. 6 beers in all, that will be 12 pesos. Okay. What's the hurry, man? Have we ever left without paying? Enough already! We're closing soon. When is soon? What's his problem? Why is he in such a hurry? Calm yourself. He must not be getting enough. All the fucking niggers spend their nights here and he leaves them alone. I work like a dog all day long, and I spend all my money here. And he treats me like shit. What's your problem, man? I don't have a problem. You let any Paraguayan sleep here all night and you make your living off all the money we spend here. What's up with that? I don't make anything with what you owe me. You forgot what it was like to need help? Cut it out! I haven't said a word all day. I know you've got problems. I didn't say a thing. Drink your beer and shut up. What's up with you, man? You think that I'm like that fucking Bolivian? A little respect! Drink up and get out of here! Watch what you say! You dirty rat! Marcelo, get him out of here! Mother-fucking thief! Stop it! I already told you I'd pay. Get him out of here! I can handle it. Mind your own business! I said mind your own business! You think I need a Bolivian like you to help me? I don't need help from anyone! Okay, man. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere! I haven't finished my beer yet. I paid for it. No fucking Paraguayan, no fucking Bolivian is going to kick me out! Tell him to calm down. Finish that beer and leave, or I'll throw you out! And you, get back to work! Go clean the TV. We're closing. What are you watching? Chilavert the Paraguayan was right. All Bolivians are assholes. What the fuck are you doing? Come here, asshole. Come on ! Leave him alone, Freddy! You 're stealing work from Argentineans. That's it! Get out! Get out! You dirty rat! You hire these fucking foreigners for peanuts and won 't hire this faggot! Get the fuck out! Asshole! And he's your snitch ! Who do you think you are? Get the fuck out! Can't you see he's drunk? That's enough. Get him out of here! - So, you're a tough guy? - Fucking foreigner! Motherfucker! Fuck you ! - I'm gonna kill you, asshole! - Get out! Leave him alone, Hector. Come here, Oso! Let's go! Stay there! Come here, Freddy, enough ! Son of a bitch ! That asshole broke my nose! Motherfucking bastard! Stop it! That's enough ! Don 't be an idiot! He broke my nose! It's nothing, man. I'm going to kill him, do you hear me? Don't make things worse. Are you saying I'm to blame? No, what are you talking about? Look at my face! It's not your fault, come on. Come with me. Shit, come on, Freddy! Keep cool. Are you okay? Don 't worry. Motherfucker! Taxi 134 to central. I need a tow truck. The license plate? BNP 719, taxi 104. What's the location? Between Pasco and Estados Unidos Streets. Stay in contact, just in case. Let's go. Let's go see the Turk, okay? Can you open the window? What for? I'm hot, open the window. We're going to see the Turk, don 't worry. Yeah, let's go. Tomorrow's another day. Son of a bitch ! What are you doing? It's always the same. They pay, and you think they're gonna stay for 15 days, and they don 't. You 're stuck with all their stuff. You have to pack their clothes. They leave all their stuff. At least they pay up front. Or else I'd make no money. He even left his papers and photos of his family. I couldn 't care less, but what am I supposed to do with his things? I have to put them somewhere. I already have a whole pile of things people left behind. I'll tell you, Iast time, this guy from Salta came with his family... Then he skipped town and left me with his wife and kids. I never saw him again. Actually we worked... We worked together. He had no place to go, so I brought him here. You only knew him for 2 days, and you brought him here! You've been here for a while. We like you here. Luckily he paid in advance. What if I had trusted him because you brought him? What would I have done? You would have had to pay. Do you make enough to pay for someone else's room? Good morning. Mr. Galmes, Enrique and Ms. Rosa Sanchez? I have a subpoena for you. This is Ms. Rosa Sanchez. You have to appear in court number 3 at 10 a.m. tomorrow. We'll take your statements. If you don 't come, you 'll be arrested. I'll be there. The man didn 't have working papers. Right. You 'll have problems. Hello. Ms. Rosa Sanchez? Here is a summons to appear in court. You must come tomorrow with Mr. Galmes. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. - Do you want something to drink? - No thanks. Have a nice day. We'll go to court together on Monday. Meet me here at 9:30. Don 't say a word about this to anyone, understand? COOK WANTED
