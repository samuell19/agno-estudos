These racks and shelves contain a lot of books. Tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands. Perhaps millions. How do you feel about them? Do they mean something to you? Are they your friends? Have you a real love of books and learning? You do? That's good. Now, do you like people and do people like you? Do you like all kinds of people? The young as well as the old? People in all stations of life? You do? That's wonderful. Because when you have these two important qualifications, love for books and love for people, you may well consider the vocation of a librarian, a vocation that gives full enjoyment to the librarian and radiates it to the public. ♪ Whoo whoo whoo ♪ Burn the books ♪ Weaponize ♪ Burn them all ♪ Weaponize ♪ If you hate their history erase their history ♪ ♪ Weaponize ♪ Remove monuments ♪ Leave no trace of their existence ♪ ♪ They say we lucky just to make it out ♪ ♪ I made it out now here we go again ♪ ♪ I could see the sky open up ♪ While I feel the doors closing in ♪ ♪ They got you livin' on a timeline ♪ ♪ With your body and your mind dyin' ♪ ♪ I ain't goin' out without a bang ♪ ♪ I'm fittin' to weaponize Einstein ♪ ♪ I have a bug in my head ♪ Like what you gonna do with those thoughts? ♪ ♪ Medicate?

Athena, nobody is trying to stop you from going into the library when we open, but the Jews have nothing to do with it. I get it. You're Jewish too. Athena, keep this up, and I promise you will not be allowed back in the library for six months. - Is that what you want? - No, no, no. I don't want that. Morning. - Cold enough for you, Ernesto? - I'm from Jalisco, bro. I'm takin' my ass back to Mexico if this cold keeps up. No, you're not. - Have a good one, man. - You, too, man. You got ten more minutes. Ten minutes. - Good morning, Mr. Anderson. - Mr. Goodson. Why is there a polar bear in the library, sir? The Natural History Museum is under renovation temporarily. I asked if we could house part of their collection. Say hello to Beary White. Hello, Beary. When, uh, when you have a moment, I need to speak to you. I have a moment right now. Board of trustees room, noon. - I'm not late. - Uh-huh. - I'm not! - Myra time. It's metro time. The public transportation in this city runs like a broken clock. You make enough money to buy a car. Right, I can be like every other self-centered individual, that just wants to drive all over the country and ruin the environment and not care about their carbon footprint. You're so fashionably green. I'm committed to doing my part, Stuart. What about you? Posting a meme on Facebook doesn't make you an activist, Myra. Besides, it's not like I drive to work in an SUV. You still drive to work when there's adequate public transportation. Which gets you to work late every day. So says you. You've seen our new polar bear? Kind of hard to miss. I think it's rather appropriate, because I think we are the new polar bear. Me, you, everyone, unless we start actually doing something about our carbon footprint. Myra, if you don't wanna leave a carbon footprint you're gonna have to stand in one place for the rest of your life. Oh, and you're also gonna need to stop eating, drinking and breathing. I will if you will. What, is this your third request? - Fourth. - Mm. I know you're my supervisor. I am trying to be respectful. I don't wanna go over your head, but, Stuart, I will if I have to. Why do you wanna transfer off this floor so badly? I want more literature. Well, then go hang out down in Arts and Lit on your lunchbreak. I wanna be around more of my literary heroes. This guy. "Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there." My tenth grade crush. Good old Johnny Steinbeck. You know, it's all drunks and crazy people down in Lit. Which is so different than up here? I'm talking about the authors. Incoming. Welcome to the Downtown Cincinnati Public Library. Good morning, Dave. So explain to me again, how do you make cheesecake without the cheese? I substitute the cheese with condensed milk is how. Oh, I don't believe it. Ain't nobody never heard of no cheesecake without the cheese, Smutts. Cheese was invented by the Chinese 3000 years ago. Hail, Caesar. I don't have to prove anything to any of you. I learned how to make it when I was in the Navy. The United States Navy sailed its first ships in 1492. Hail, Caesar. Hey, I heard two more people froze to death last night in Northside. I don't know why they don't just let us stay here when it gets this cold. - Yeah. You know, he's right. - Yeah. We should just stay right here when it gets this cold. They're not gonna turn the library into a flophouse for alcoholics, Smutts. I haven't had a drink in two weeks. - That's a lie. - That's a miracle! That's a lie, Smutts. You and me, we had some beer a few days ago. - See, see, I knew it. - Oh, come on, man. I knew you was full of shit with that no drinkin' shit. Just like y... your cheese-less cheesecake too. Anybody got any aspirin? Aspirin was discovered by the French 600 years ago. It was originally made from apple seeds. - Hail, Caesar. - Hail, Caesar. Aspirin, Caesar, is made from willow bark, not apple seeds. Then how come it's always white, huh? Answer me that one, smart guy. 'Cause it's mixed with cornstarch. Hey. So it's cold enough for you, Mr. Goodson? It's gonna be brutal the next couple nights for sure. We can all come stay at your place. - I would if I could. - You could, but you won't. No judgement here though. Look, Jackson. Use it to get some food, maybe a room. You're gonna offer me money and then tell me what to do with it? W... well, no, I was just suggesting a few things that I thought you... you might need, is all. How do you know what I need? I'm just messing with you, man. He was just messing with you. - For the cause. - Evil is the root of all money. Hail, Caesar! You guys are just encouraging him. Whoa. - Who's he? - That's George. - Where are you from, George? - He's shy. Has to get to know you. Okay. Montana. Montana? The land of 10,000 lakes.

I got a quote from a book I turned in, like, last week. Uh, forgot the author, and the title, but, uh, it's big, it's red, and I... I found it on the top shelf. Can you find it for me? I need journal articles on parents going back to college. Where are your books on critical thinking? What kind of apple did Eve eat? I need the addresses of the permanent missions of the United Nations listed by countries. Can you tell me why so many famous civil war battles were fought on national park sites? I need a colored photograph of George Washington.

Remember that children's story time will take place today at 2:00 and at 4:00 p.m... Recommended for children ages four through eight. Mr. Goodson. I didn't know this meeting would be so formal, Mr. Anderson. Well, it's time-sensitive, Mr. Goodson. The, uh, the library's being sued. Have a seat. The attorneys for the plaintiff have presented the city a settlement offer. However, we need to have all the facts. I believe you've met Mr. Foley and Mr. Larson before from our board of trustees who have been named as defendants in this case. Their attorney, Mr. Abernathy. Of course, you know Mr. Ramirez. He as well has been named a defendant in this along with me and you. Hamilton County Prosecutor Josh Davis. - I've seen you on television. - Hmm. Do you recognize this man? - Yeah, that's Ike. - Ike's name is Isiah Jennings. Mr. Jennings is suing the Cincinnati Public Library for discrimination. In his petition, he claims approximately ten weeks ago Mr. Goodson and Mr. Ramirez asked him to leave the library because, and I quote, "My body odor." Did you ask Mr. Jennings to leave the library because of his body odor? We'd been getting complaints. Daily complaints from library personnel and patrons about the way Ike smelled. - So that's yes then? - Yes. And then you and Mr. Goodson escorted Mr. Jennings outside of the building? That's right. And as you were escorting him out do you recall saying anything to him? I may have said something. Small talk. So when you got him out to the sidewalk in front of the library, did you say, "Elvis has left the building?" Excuse me. - What is that? - Excuse me. I'm asking Mr. Ramirez right now. I just need to get some facts. Have you taken into account that in addition to being homeless and on the street for the last ten years that Ike is also mentally ill? Mr. Goodson, I will get to you soon enough. He hears voices. One of them... Mr. Goodson, Mr. Davis is simply trying to determine what action the city needs to take, if it goes to trial or not, okay? The settlement offer from the attorneys representing Mr. Jennings is $750,000. Now if the city passes on this offer, it's gonna go to trial, and if the city of Cincinnati is gonna write a check for $750,000 to a mentally ill homeless man, I need to be able to explain to the mayor's office exactly what happened. What do you smell? On me, what do you smell? - Cologne. - Is it offensive? It's on a little heavy, but obviously that's your style. Would you ask me to leave the library because of my cologne? If we received enough complaints from other patrons, yes, maybe I would. And you'd be violating my First Amendment rights, Mr. Goodson 'cause at present, there is no law about people wearing cologne nor is there a law determining how much cologne a person can apply... Mr. Davis, libraries all over the country struggle with the balance between individual rights and the rights of other patrons to have a safe and healthy environment. If Mr. Goodson asked me to leave the premises because of my cologne, is he not impinging on my First Amendment rights to access the public library, to information and its resources? Librarians take very seriously the right to freedom of information. It's a core tenet of what we do. Which is exactly what Mr. Goodson denied Isiah Jennings when he asked him to leave the library because of how he smelled. Please be respectful of those patrons who are on the waiting list to use the computers. Thank you so much, chief. I'm glad to know we're on the same page. - Of course. - Appreciate it, chief. Okay. Bill, come on in. Excuse me. Josh Davis looking for an endorsement? You can't get elected mayor of Cincy without the support of this department. He's an asshole. I'm endorsing Bradley. Davis knows it. - He thinks it's a black thing. - Oh. - Is it? - It's a character thing. But, yes, I would like to see more color in the local government. But you ain't come here to talk politics. No. It's about your request for a leave of absence. That's right. I don't need to tell you this is the busiest time of year for my best crisis negotiator to be off the clock. My son is missing. Bill, we both know your son's not missing. He's strung out somewhere doing God knows what. Yes, he is an addict, and I'm trying to keep him from becoming another casualty on the streets, Tom. There's only so much you can do, brother. You don't think I know that? For God's sakes, Tom! Come on. Bill... I'm sorry. I can't let you go right now. Not right now. You're a father, Tom. I'm also the chief of police for a city with one of the biggest opioid epidemics in the country. Look, I am sorry about your son. I truly am. I mean, do you have any leads or anything? He used his debit card last Sunday, so he's still in town. We just don't know where. - A debit card? - His mom. You know, she hopes he'll use it for food or warm clothes or... I get it. Tom... please. Tom, please. I'm gonna get you some time off, pal. That's my promise to you. Good evening. May I have your attention, please? In ten minutes, the main library will be closing for the night. If you're working on a computer, please be sure to save your work before shutting it down and pick up any items you may have at the printer. Also, be sure to take any materials you wish to borrow to the checkout station. Once again, the main library will be closing in ten minutes. Library is closed, people! Wrap it up and let's go! Library is closed. Athena, time to go. I'll leave when I'm damn good and ready. Our End Hunger in Cincy donation drive will continue through... - I'm ready now. - Okay. Accepting all canned and bottled food items. Remember, every donation counts. We open at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow, okay? - You need a ride home? - I'm halfway across the city. And the bus is actually much warmer than your shitty old car, so... - How you holding up? - I'm peachy. Well, please don't let it get to you. You know, literally, our biggest struggle here is knowing which side of right we're actually walking on, so... I mean, I wish all these problems could just be solved by a community bake sale, but... they can't. I do go home sometimes and... just cry myself to sleep because... I mean, we're only human, right? But not tonight. Because tonight is make-dinner-for-my-mama night. So your transfer to Arts and Lit... next week. My hero. A training course... Sleep well, comrade. Will be taking place this Saturday in the quad after closing hours. Attendance is voluntary. So you did get my messages. - About the heat? - About the absence of it. - It's an old building, Stuart. - Yeah. I know. Built 1865. Did you know that? - It's part of the charm. - Oh, yeah? How charming wearing my entire wardrobe to bed for the last three nights. You were aware that this building had issues with its heat when you signed the lease. It's, like, a 0 degrees in here. As you can see, I'm working on it. Did you work up an appetite? I brought you these heaters from upstairs. I thought you could use them until the heat comes back on. Thank you. I'm gonna have to call a real repairman tomorrow. Real being the operative word. I took the job... because it offered a break on the rent. But I'm not gonna lie, there's an awful lot that needs fixing about this place. Like, a whole lot. Our landlord doesn't really expect you to do all the maintenance around here, does he? I refused to have dinner with him last month and then the month before that, so he seems to think he's really screwing me even though he's not really screwing me. What are you doing? A medium pizza with fresh tomatoes and basil costs $12.50. But a plain cheese costs just under ten bucks. So since I grow my own... Wow. You keep your apartment really neat and clean. - You'd hate to see my place. - That's my thing. - I'm a little OCD. - Ah. Chaos in the environment, chaos in your head. Oh, well, there's always chaos in my head. It doesn't matter whether I take the trash out or not. What made you decide to become a librarian? You know, I've been asking myself that question a lot lately. It must be really nice to have a job where you get to sit around and read all day, huh? Oh, yeah. I mean, do people even go to libraries anymore? Yes. You should come visit. Get yourself a library card. Impress your friends. I might just do that. Come and watch you do all your freaky librarian things. You know, watch you get all crazy with your Dewey Decimal System. "Learning The Qur'an." Hm. You getting into it? Are you thinking about converting? Some books get defaced and, you know, if I can fix them, make a little extra money, I do. Oh, wow. Hate crimes. Seeing a lot of that lately. So you're just really into books, huh? Books saved my life. Saved your life? Books helped me get sober and... helped me turn my life around. They were tangible and they were real. Something I could get my hands and my head around, so yeah. Yeah, they saved my life. "It works if you work it." One year. One year and still trudging the road of happy destiny. I piled up a bunch of other addictions while I was at it. Drugs... sex. Tell me about it. I'm still working on that one. Stuart. Come on. It's not like I see a parade of women coming in and out of your apartment. Are you clockin' me? I'm the building manager. I... see a lot of stuff. I get to know the habits of the tenants. - Okay. - Yeah. The guy, over in 6, I'll bet he's got a freezer full of body parts. No. No, he's an accountant. Never late on his rent. Okay. Um, t... the couple over in 4? Oh. They're professors at UC. Also, swingers. - No way. - Mm-hmm. - Did they... - Invite me to join them? Yes. I didn't, of course. The guy up in 10? Still gathering some intel on him. He's a little weird. Not creepy... but weird. So far, I know he's really into books... and he's a librarian, so that makes sense. He's, uh, sober. He grows his own tomatoes. And he doesn't really have a lot of visitors. I think you should stay away from him. Ramstead? No. Nobody in here with that name, man. Well, maybe he's under an alias. He doesn't wanna be found. Most of the men in here don't, detective, but you can go ahead and have yourself a peek just the same. So we'll try again tomorrow. Sure. You don't have to walk me to the door. I wasn't going to. It's 10 degrees outside. I know you're still upset about the debit card... No, I'm not. He's your son, too, Marcy. And if he's not too loaded, let's just hope he had the sense to use it to get a room tonight. - Good morning. - Hi. You know, I think I'd like to come down to the library and see some of those books that saved your life. Alright, if you feel like braving the cold. Yeah. We close at 6 o'clock, so come on down. Maybe we can, I don't know, grab a bite to eat over at OTR? - Yeah. - Yeah. Good. Okay. Hey. You know, I was a lot of things before I was a drunk. I wasn't always... fixing broken heaters for cheap rent. I hope this isn't gonna get weird, because I don't really think I can handle this getting weird. You seem like a really good guy and I hope I'm not wrong. And with this blast of Arctic air and frigid temperatures, local homeless shelters are hitting capacity... The bitter cold Arctic air is settling in and we've got a very cold night coming up tonight. Probably the coldest night of the year. The lowest... These guys bought this lion cub, right, at Harrods, release it into the wild. Twenty years later, they go back and the freakin' lion remembers them. - Barnes. - He's okay. Alright. You're good. - Drugs? - Exposure. - You know him? - Yeah, he's a regular patron. We're gonna go live in moments, Rebecca. Alright. Let's go. Let's get this over with before I freakin' freeze to death. - Ernesto. - Yeah? - Did you find him? - Yeah. I tried to revive him, but he was unresponsive. This weather's no joke, brother. City in recent days. The severe cold spell has already claimed nearly half a dozen lives this week. The unidentified homeless man was found dead just outside the doors of the Downtown Cincinnati Public Library. Witnesses called police early this morning to report a body outside the library near Walnut Street. Police are not treating the scene as a homicide. However... Indian Hill, where Josh Davis grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth. Even if he's now trying to deny it. I'm Earl Bradley. I grew up here, on these streets, in this community. I'm a pastor and small businessman. It's why I'll stand up to special interest and fight for you every day because we need a mayor for all of us. This thing went up on their website last week. It's already gone viral. Hm. Freakin' baby carriage? It's effective, and it's, uh, it's driving grassroots low-dollar fundraising, Josh. Also means Bradley gets on TV earlier than we do. Maybe you should go work for him. Maybe I will. Let's have a look at our spot. If it sucks, then maybe you'll need to. What happened to Cincinnati? To our neighborhoods? Who let criminals take control of our city? Politicians in Columbus who don't have a clue, that's who. Voice sounds good. Well, enough's enough. I'm Josh Davis. As prosecutor, I cracked down on crime. Tough but fair. As mayor, I will take on politics as usual and restore law and order so we can help grow small business, protect our way of life to move Cincinnati forward. It doesn't suck. It doesn't suck. This goes up on our website Monday, Josh. Tell me, what don't you like about it? I just wish I looked nicer. - Nicer? - Yeah, you know, not so angry. I mean, I'm not an angry guy. Just, I'm passionate, you know. I wanna, I wanna look nicer in the ad. Yeah, yeah. Pl... plenty of takes. We'll... we'll go through them all with that in mind, find you a nicer take. You got it, Josh. Nicer take. Can I beat him? Bradley's a pillar of the community, Josh. - He's a pastor, he's a... - Can I beat him? No. Early polling suggests that if the election were held tomorrow, he wins in a walk. Unless... unless something were to happen, something big that puts you and the community in the spotlight, alright? Something besides... another embarrassing unarmed police shooting. - Hi. - Yes. I'm looking for a globe of the Earth. They're all right there. No, that's not good enough. Isn't there a life-sized one? Yes, but it's currently in use. Hey, uh, there are a bunch of guys fighting in the men's room. You were supposed to look out for him, Ray. Lay off him, man, you were more concerned about finding a bottle than you were about any of us. Oh, that's bullshit, Smutts! You would be dead ten times if I wasn't there to save your ass! - You know it! - What's going on, fellas? Caesar's missing. No one has seen him since last night. We were riding on the metro to keep warm. Somewhere along the way, he must have wandered off. We looked around and he was just gone! Just like that. One minute he's there, the next minute he's not. We looked all around. No one has seen him. I mean, nobody! Cold must have got him, Mr. Goodson. I got a bad feeling, man. It ain't like Caesar to not be here when the public opens. - Caesar's dead. - What? How do you know that, George? - Because I killed him. - What? You killed Caesar? - That's right. - Why would you kill Caesar? What did he ever do to you? He never did anything to me. I didn't even know him that good. So... what do you mean you killed him? I killed him with my laser eyes. See, the government, they... they... they put this weapon in my head when I was a baby. It's a laser. It, it kills people when I look at 'em for too long. It's, it's a chip. They put 'em in a lot of babies when they're born. And... and that's why I... I don't wanna look at any of you for so long. I... I don't wanna kill anyone else. You looked at Caesar too long? That's what happened, Big George? I looked at him... for a real long time with my laser eyes. He exploded. Caesar exploded? You mean like in that movie, "Scanners?" - I love that movie, man. - Oh, man. You know. You... you remember? Boom. - You saw that movie, right? - Oh! - Oh, come on, Stuart! - That was a good movie. - You gotta know! You know! - You guys are crazy, man. - It's like... - Oh. Boom. Yeah. Stupid. You're so... Oh, I love it. I love it though. Good evening. May I have your attention, please? In ten minutes, the main library will be closing for the night. If you are working on a computer, please be sure to save your work before shutting it down. Once again, the main library will be closing in ten minutes. Mr. Goodson, I gotta talk to you. Look, all, all the shelters downtown are full up again. Uh-huh. What about the emergency overflow at Shelterhouse? That's a 40-minute walk away. In this weather? In these shoes? Look, Mr. Goodson, you know I'm a veteran, right? I served my country. This all I get? Well, look. I... I... I decided to organize. Organize? We ain't gonna leave the library tonight. Tonight we occupy. - Occupy? Is that right? - Yeah. Well, so what about tomorrow night? And the night after that? What if this cold snap lasts into next week? - Have you thought about that? - Mr. Goodson, listen to me! Every public official in this town know there's not enough shelter for us people on the street. Those so-called Christians, they, they pretend like they don't know that. Feed the hungry. Clothe the poor. House the homeless. Now see, that's what Jesus said. But I don't think he said occupy. Well, it worked for those hippies down in Wall Street. Maybe it can work here for us.

I... it's about the weather. I'll catch up with you. - The weather? - Yes. We need to keep the library open tonight because of it. Our patrons who don't get into shelters, they are at risk of exposure. T... the temperature's gonna drop below 0. Mr. Goodson, I'm well aware of the problem, but we're a public library. We're not a shelter for the homeless. No, that's exactly what we are. Every day of every week. I'm not in the position to declare our library an emergency shelter. People are freezing to death in our own city. - How are you okay with that? - Whoa, hey! I'm not. I'm not okay with it. Okay, you could, you could call the mayor's office. You could call the mayor's office right now! - Mr. Goodson... - But... Stuart, listen. The board of trustees wants you gone. That's what's going on. And I'm trying, but I'm having a difficult time makin' a case for you to stay here. So, no. The library will not be an emergency shelter tonight, tomorrow, not ever. They wanna fire me? They'd prefer if you tendered your resignation. I was following library protocol, sir. Fire me for doing my job? I'm sorry. - It's out of my control. - Out of your control?

Pleas exit the building. Once again... Stuart, what's going on? Nobody's leaving. Patrons are staging an action. - What are they protesting? - Freezing to death. Stuart. What the hell's going on, man? What are all these people still doing here? Remember how difficult it was to get Ike out of the library? Yeah, we should have left his stinky-ass alone. We wouldn't be in all this trouble. Well, now we got a whole lot of Ikes in here who don't wanna go out in the cold. I don't blame 'em, man. I wouldn't either. What's it gonna be, Mr. Goodson? You're either one of us or you're one of them, right? Everybody, uh, rally up! Rally up! Ernesto, what's going on up on three? Uh, everybody, listen up! The library has not been sanctioned an official emergency shelter yet. - But we believe it should be! - Ernesto, you on this? Yeah, give me a sec. What the hell do I tell him? Dude. Uh, you ever been arrested? - Uh, no, have you? - Unfortunately. - Pepper sprayed? - No. You have? Are we staying or we goin'? Get out of here, Myra. If you're staying, I'm gonna stay. Incoming! - George. - Don't look at me. I'm... I'm not... I'm not lookin' at you. But I need you to move that bookshelf up against the doors. Why? Be... because security is coming and... and... and we don't want 'em in here. Why? Because they have laser eyes too. From... from the government? Wh... when they were babies? Yes, and we don't want them in here hurting people. Jackson, give us a hand! What is it they want, Mr. Anderson? - They wanna stay warm. - Warm? Why can't we handle this in-house with our own security detail? It's standard operating procedure to alert the Cincy PD if we're in a lockdown situation, sir. So, what's the plan? Uh, plan? Uh, uh, that was it. You know, um, they're out, we're in. I know they're watchin'. Oh, yeah. They're... they're lookin' at us like a... another bunch of crazy angry niggas. It's up to you to prove 'em wrong, Mr. Goodson. Why me? 'Cause they don't think you crazy. Come on, man! Why him? This isn't an action. This is... a disaster. Yeah? Wh... what about Peters? Can't you track down Lou? Okay. Yeah, okay. Five minutes. What is it? There's some situation at the central library. Probably somebody having a meltdown about an overdue book. Mm. You wanna go with? I mean, it could be just a bunch of nothing. Yeah, when's the last time they called you in for just a bunch of nothing? - I'm sorry. - I know. Shit. What have we got? We've got 70-plus homeless men barricaded on the northeast corner of the third floor. Now, why would this guy initiate this action? Has he got some beef with the library or... he's been spending too much time in the True Crime section? - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, uh, Ernesto. Yeah, Stuart did not initiate this. The patrons did. Mr. Anderson, I'm gonna need an address for Goodson so that a judge can issue a search warrant for his residence, try to get some idea of his state of mind. Mr. Goodson was recently named in a lawsuit brought against the library in which he and... Mr. Ramirez were primary defendants. We... we settled yesterday. In the tune of $750,000. You can read all about it in the paper on Monday. Hm. Stuart Goodson. What is it with this guy? He seems hell-bent on ruining my week. He thinks he's saving people's lives by keeping them out of the cold. Well, we have shelters in place for that. Well, apparently, not enough of them. So that's what this is all about? It's some sort of exercise in civil disobedience? So, we, uh, send in a tactical team, battering ram, crash the door, toss in some tear gas, arrest 'em all for trespassing, we're home before "The Tonight Show." This is my operation, Davis. Besides, we don't even know what they want. What they want? Who cares what they want? This is a public facility, they're trespassing, they're breaking the law, we need to get them out of there! Well, now, what are you doin' up here when the cameras are downstairs? Excuse me! Do you people know how to do anything without the use of excessive force? This is a public library, for God's sake. Yes, sir. Next station, Ninth and Walnut, The Library. - Hello. - Hey. I'm outside of the library and there are a lot of cop cars here. Is everything alright? Not exactly. Is this one of your freaky librarian things? The patrons have turned the building into an emergency homeless shelter. Obviously, there's been some pushback. Okay, so now is probably not a great time to come and get my library card. You still wanna hang out with me? Do you have any idea how much cooler you're gonna be with a criminal record? Well, I... I kind of already have one. I knew deep down you're a bad boy. Wow. You know, news trucks just pulled up. The news? You know, you're gonna be on TV. Good evening, this is Rebecca Parks with breaking news from Downtown Cincinnati where a situation is unfolding inside the public library. Information is sketchy at this time, and no details have been released. But as you can see, the Cincinnati Police Department has been dispatched. So we don't know if it's a hostage situation or an active shooter. What was that? To update you on news as it breaks. As you know, resources are already stretched thin due to the record-breaking cold weather we are experiencing. Live and trying to stay warm from Downtown Public Library. Well, at least we're all staying warm. Back to you in the studio. Thank you, Rebeca, we'll stay on top of that story as it develops. Myra? The cops? Really? I can't do this. I... I have... I have the worst feeling about this. - I have to get out of here. - Hold on. Hold on. This is totally in your wheelhouse. You're the one who's always like, "Vive la Resistance!" I wish this was in my wheelhouse! This is bigger than riding the metro and getting organic food. I am not prepared to be in a standoff with a cop. I can't do that. I don't know how to do that. - Please, just understand me. - Okay. My mom's gonna watch that. She is not well. You know that. It is not gonna be good for her to see that. I get it. And... we're gonna get you out of here. How? You gonna answer that, Mr. Goodson? - Why don't you? - Well, I don't work here. - Hello? - What are you doing in there? - Who is this? - Is this Stuart Goodson? It is. This is Detective Bill Ramstead from the Cincinnati PD. - Hello, detective. - Why don't you call me Bill? Why don't I call you William? Only my mother calls me William. May I call you Stuart? Only my friends call me Stuart. A lot of your friends out here are worried about you, buddy. They'd like to see this situation resolve itself peacefully. Tell him, tell him this is a peaceful demonstration. This is a peaceful demonstration. So no one's being held against their will? No. Everyone is here because they wanna be here. Everyone is here because they wanna be here. Would it be safe to assume that some are not of, uh, sound mind? Uh, I mean, you don't need to be mentally ill to know that it's freezing outside, detective. That was good, man. So why'd you barricade the doors? [whispers To make it hard for you mo-fuckers to get in here to take us out. You can say it. Yeah. Go on, say that. Say that. To... to make it harder on you... mo-fos to get in here and take us out. Look, you make it harder on us, we're gonna have to make it harder on you, brother. And sooner or later, you're gonna have to open that door. Well, tell him we plan to open the doors first thing tomor... Look, why don't you just hand the phone to the guy that's doin' all the talking? It will be a real timesaver, okay? No, I don't wanna talk to the police. He says he doesn't wanna talk to the police. Yeah, yeah, I heard him. Look, Goodson, do you have any idea what the hell you're doin' in there? And how much trouble you're all gonna be in for this stunt? Um, "We need the library to remain open as an emergency shelter for the duration of the cold spell. Or provide us with a reasonable facility." Now what are you gonna give me in return? We're negotiating? That's what they pay me for, buddy. We don't have anything to give you. Well, why don't you just quit? Come on out now before anybody gets hurt. Which is what you should do, Goodson! - That sounds like Davis. - Goddamn right it is! You still wearing that cheap cologne? - Everybody... - Son of a bitch! Everybody, calm down. Just... Please, calm down. Goodson. You still there, Goodson? Here's our demand. I want Davis to go outside. Outside? That's right. I want Davis to go outside in front of the library to lay down on the concrete for five minutes. No blankets. I guess you're gonna miss "The Tonight Show." Civil disobedience, my ass. This is petty revenge. That's a pretty odd demand. Um... Mr. Goodson, you okay? Stuart? Hi. Can you do me a favor and just, uh, keep the press back for about five minutes? Josh, Rebecca Parks with WCBO. What are you doing, sir? Can you tell us what's happening inside the library? Is there an emergency inside the building? Hi, yeah. Jim and Carol. We're still live at the scene at the Downtown branch of the public library where Hamilton County prosecutor Josh Davis has emerged from the building and for some unknown reason... He's doin' it. He's actually laying on the pavement. - That's awesome. - You sure about that? Bizarre and crazy are certainly two words I would use to describe this. Strange live images to you at home. Many of you know Josh Davis has announced his plans to run for mayor of Cincinnati. So I'm sure he'll have some explanation for us and for the viewers of this city as to just what the heck is going on here. Son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. Okay, I'll answer all your questions in just a moment. Well, we can all agree that, uh, what we've just witnessed was an irrational act, especially considering the, uh, extreme temperatures this evening, but I want to assure all of you that, uh, and the people of Cincinnati that I am not mad. The only madness tonight comes in the form of one particular individual who has seized control of one of our most respected institutions. Now without getting into details, this individual is an employee of the public library, and as we've tried to negotiate in a peaceful manner with this individual, we were presented with a, a list of demands, one of which was an order for me to lay outside in front of the building on the street for a period of five minutes. Did the suspect say why he wanted you to lie down in the street? Well, obviously, he's, uh, he's disturbed in some way. I mean, he may be mentally ill. We're, uh, we're still investigating that. - Is the suspect armed? - Uh, is he armed? Well, my experience would tell me that, uh, this individual would have a hard time detaining 100 people if he wasn't armed with... with some kind of weapon. Thank you very much, we're trying to resolve this situation as calmly and as peacefully as we possibly can. Oh, great. You have a gun. Mr. Goodson? Of course, he doesn't, Ray. You don't, do you? I've never even held a gun, Smutts. Hey, buddy. Kill 'em all. - Let God sort 'em out. - Have a nice night. sir. You hear me? Kill 'em all. Who... who was that? It's a wrong number. This is Ramstead. I'm gonna try to control the incoming calls, keep the crackpots at bay. Well, you can start with Davis. Why is he telling the press that this is a hostage situation? Goodson, you're the one who told him to go outside and lie on the ground. The guy wants to be mayor, he doesn't have a clue what's going on in his own damn city. - Goodson... - Nobody in here has a weapon! You gotta calm down. Why are you guys treating me like I'm a suspect? This thing isn't about me! What about your apartment? My apartment? What about it? We have a warrant. Now you tell me are we gonna find anything funny when we get inside there? Funny? You mean like a... a booby trap? Or a circus clown? Uh, uh, Mr. Goodson, we gotta keep... Don't you see what they're trying to do here? - I have to ask. - I'm a librarian. And you got a lot of nervous people out here. What the hell do you guys have to be nervous about? You got all the guns. Are you on any drugs or medication right now? Not at the moment, detective, but what are you sellin'? Maybe I better take the rest of the calls. You're probably gonna get us all killed. Yeah. That was quite a campaign speech. And that, my friends, was a lesson in how you sway public opinion. Fake news? I created a narrative which allows us to bring this situation to a close. Not next week or a month from now but tonight. This evenin'. Don't everybody thank me at once. Are you mentally unstable? Listen, Davis is trying to spin this story to make me look crazy. This is a peaceful demonstration. Okay, so you need to tell your side. How? You need to get on TV... or you need to get on the phone with a reporter. Because if people see something on TV, they believe it's true. I can't go on television. Stuart, get some photos or videos and send them to me. Video of what? Whatever. Whatever's really happening in there, okay? - Help! - Stuart? Hey. Hello... Hello? Can someone call 911? Stuart, could you call 9-1-1? - He's having a seizure. - Got it. Can I have your coat, please? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hold on. Yeah, we have a medical emergency in here. We have a man down. We're calling for a truce. I'm calling for a truce to get him out. Hey, be cool in here. I don't wanna be coming back to take you out on one of these. - Sorry, Myra. - Don't apologize. Just... I'm gonna see you soon, okay? You the detective I've been talking to? That's right. You're in poor company. Coming from the guy who's got himself locked down in a room full of bums. Ah, you'd fit right in. Goodson, you got the doors open. Now this is an opportunity for you to stand down, end this right now. You want us out? Give us somewhere to go. How about we all go to your place? Well, my ex-wife got the house in Mount Adams, so I'd love to see everybody go over there. I'm gonna go, uh, bring in some food. I'll call in an order and pay for it. I'm gonna have to run that request up the flagpole. Well, you run it up the flagpole and across the street to LaRosa's. Are we negotiating now? That's what they pay you for. - Uh, wait a second. - Wh... what are you doing? Stop! You stop! What about our truce? Hey, take it easy. I'm not going for my weapon. Anybody that look like him in there tonight? - Is that your son? - Yeah. - What's his name? - Michael. Mike. I thought he might be in there. I haven't seen him. Oh, you hang on to it. This is what we netted from the search of Goodson's apartment. And he has a series of priors. "Drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest shoplifting from a grocery store, trespassing." From this sheet, it sounds like this guy was on the streets. He was. - And you hired him, anyway? - I did. He's been sober for a number of years, earned his degree and worked harder than anyone I've ever seen to get himself right. Library gave him a second chance. Tonight he pisses it all away. ♪ Mm mm mm mm ♪ Mm mm mm mm ♪ Mm mm mm mm - Hey, guys. - Hey, what's up, baby? Mr. Goodson. ♪ Mm mm mm mm Look at her, Mr. Goodson. - What do you think? - She's pretty, Smutts. And she wants to go out on a date with me. She's from around here too. Just across the river in Covington. She's a flight attendant for Delta. And have you told her about you? Hell, no. She thinks I'm a pilot. Oh, this internet dating stuff is a liar's paradise, Mr. Goodson. Good luck. Hi, mom. Do you know that Smutts is online right now trying to get a date? That's what he does every day, Mr. Goodson. Has he ever hooked up? That fool be dreamin'. What about you? You ever dream about getting off the street? No, not really. I mean, there's a certain freedom out there. I mean, you know... I may not have money and stuff... but on the other hand, I don't have anything that anybody wants or could take. Now that's freedom. So why do all this? For who? For what? To shake the tree. Let 'em know that we still matter. God gives us all a voice. It's up to us whether we use it or stay silent. I mean, the police are out there, the media. We got their attention, right? They'll forget all about this by tomorrow. No. Maybe, maybe not. We gotta raise the level. We gotta keep... the black prophetic fire... alive. We gotta make some noise. We gotta make some noise. We gotta make some noise. We gotta make some noise. ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Make some noise ♪ Well, if you guys aren't gonna charge me, I think I'm just gonna get out of here. Sit down. So you worked with him for how long? Yeah, you know, you don't have to answer any of this. - Five years. - Mm. He's a model citizen. He's a real stand-up guy. I mean, I don't know what the hell you want me to say. He's having some sort of nervous breakdown? He's come unhinged? So you guys have an excuse, you can just go in there and, you know, do what cops do best. Break down the door. Don't shoot me, it's just my cell phone. Probably... Oh, my mom. Can I take it? Yeah. Hey, mama. I know. I'm safe. It's okay. Well, I'm gonna be leaving once these douchebags stop violating my Fourth Amendment rights and... and then I can text you, okay. Alright, I love you. Bye. - Excuse me. Sorry, just... - Here you go. - Oh, Ernesto, you're a saint. - Y tu. Food's here. Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. How do we know they're not a cop? How do we know you're not a cop? I don't know. But I'm not. W... why don't we ask him a question that, that only a pizza guy would know? How much do you charge for a... a plain cheese pizza? Medium or large? - Medium. - 9.50. And if I wanna add fresh tomatoes and basil? - 12.50. - He's legit. Damn it, Chip. Close the door! Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a sec? Honey, look, we're about to go live. I don't have the time. Sorry, doll. I was wondering if you wanted to have contact with my friend who's in the middle of the situation inside, but since you're being such a bitch, I'm gonna have to find somebody else... No, no, no. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. - What's your name? - Uh, I'm Angela. - Angela. - Yeah. Hey. I've had an impossible day. Really? Did your manicurist cancel on you? I deserve that. You said you had a friend inside? - Yeah. - Inside the room with hostages? They're not hostages. And I have video to prove it. Thought we weren't allowed to eat in the library, Mr. Goodson? Just tonight, Ray. Only one piece, Big George? I'm practicing portion control. - Yo, what you doin', man? - Hey, yo! Hey, give me that! You can't take that! Hey, just takin' what's mine, man. Quit being an asshole, man! Come on! And what's the downside of letting them stay put here tonight, or if not that, finding them an alternative shelter? I mean, wha... what's the cost? Busses to transport them to it? It opens the door to every nutcase with a cause to hold this city hostage. This is a disrupter. The Cincinnati PD has effective protocols in place to neutralize this. It's not always pretty, but it gets the job done. So you're saying we go in there and we teargas 100 homeless people? That would make one hell of a campaign ad. "Vote for Davis or he'll teargas you." You... you... you know, I'm not trying to diminish the severity of the situation here or... or what it is that you do, but, uh... Stuart Goodson is no nutcase. It is my job to uphold the law and protect democracy in this city. You know, I devoted my entire life to preserving the freedom of information that flows in and out of this institution. The public library is the last bastion of true democracy that we have in this country, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit here and let you thugs turn it into a battlefield. Well, if we're not gonna get kinky and start waterboarding, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go. Hey... try not to... kill any of my friends tonight. - Hey, Rebecca? - Wait, wait, wait. This just in. Wait for it, Chip. Our next feed is going national. Oh, cool. Oh, wait, wait. My Twitter feed is blowing up. I've got 3000 new followers since this story broke. - Chip, this is huge. - Great. Listen, um, based on what I'm seeing in these video clips here, uh, there doesn't appear to be anything more than a demonstration going on inside. - What? Hm? - Take a look. There's no evidence of any threat. I think there is. What are you seeing that I'm not? There are more eyeballs tuned in to this story than anything we've covered in the last six months. That's what I'm seeing, Chip. Oh. - Who's that? - Did you hear that? Mr. Anderson. I'm not here to try to talk you out. Let him in. What's goin' on? Hey. Yeah. Kumbaya. Hi. - Anybody sittin' here? - Go ahead. - Hi. - Hi. Did you get those pictures and the videos I sent? I did. Are you ready for your close-up? - What do I say? - You say the truth. Hi. Hi, did you get the clips I sent you? - I did. I did. - Okay. The guy's a friend of yours? Yeah, I mean, well, we live in the same building, but you saw what's really going on in there, right? I did. I said I did, so I must have, right? Yeah. - Angela. - Uh-huh. These things very rarely end well, okay? So why don't you just stick around, stay close, and in case this barrel of monkeys goes sideways, we can get you on for an interview. Thanks. Okay. Chip, we got him patched in? Great. Okay. - Stuart? - Uh, yes. That's me. Hi. This is Rebecca Parks from WCBO. How are you doing in there? Well, uh, I... I'd be a hell of a lot better if you people in the media would get your facts straight before you start spreading misinformation with your broadcast. Hey, thank you so much for this exclusive. Alright, Chip. We good? We have breaking news out of Cincinnati, Ohio, tonight where it appears a hostage situation in a downtown library has been going on for the better part of the night. We're gonna take you there live to our Cincinnati affiliate... Would you mind clearing my eye line, honey? Chip? Rebecca Parks has been covering the scene since it began. Rebecca? That's right, we do have a breaking news, a WCBO exclusive, outside the extremely chilly central library which has been on lockdown since about 6 o'clock this evening. A newly released information about this situation is the man responsible for the lockdown has a criminal past. We have obtained some images from inside the building that are exclusive to us. Hi, mom. What the... How did they get this footage? Where are they getting this footage from? And now, on the phone, we have with us Mr. Stuart Goodson who many believe is the instigator for the lockdown, and some say is holding over 100 people inside the library against their will. Mr. Goodson, are you there, sir? Yeah, I am. You're a city librarian, is that correct? - A supervisor? - Yes, that's right. Are officials correct in the assumption that you are indeed holding people against their will? Of course not. No, tha... that is absolutely false. So this is not a hostage situation? It never was. Well, there seems to be a whole lot of confusion about what exactly is going on inside the building, Mr. Goodson. Now a source inside the police department has confirmed that you've had quite a few brushes with law enforcement in the past, and that you yourself were, in fact, homeless and living on the street some years ago. Okay. Would you care to comment on that? You just did. Well, I'm... I'm simply trying to clarify for our viewers at home what's happening in there. This is a humanitarian crisis that's happening in our own city. This is not some problem that's gonna be solved with a community bake sale. That's my line. Well, I'm... I'm hoping that you can shed a little light on it and... and give us all some context here, Mr. Goodson. - Context? - Yes, that's right. Context. "There is a, uh... a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a... a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success." What is he saying? What is he talking about? Okay, a failure, Mr. Goodson. Can you elaborate on that a bit? "The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks and the ripe fruit, and in the eyes of the people, there is a failure, and in the eyes of the hungry, there is a... a growing wrath." Okay, so you're saying my goodness, the people inside are angry. Is that right? "In the soul of the people, the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy... growing heavy for the vintage." Well... some interesting words from inside the central library here in Downtown Cincinnati where we still have a lockdown situation that doesn't appear to be ending... anytime soon. Damn it. You put me on the phone with a lunatic. Hello? You set me up! That was John Steinbeck. "Grapes of Wrath." It's required tenth grade reading material. And if that doesn't prove to you that this is not a hostage situation, I don't think that you're qualified to report even the weather. Chip. Sweet. Good words. I wish they'd been mine. Well, they are yours, Stuart. And mine. And theirs. They belong to all of us. What do you think's gonna happen to us, man? We all going to jail tonight? They'll probably get us for trespassin' and resistin'. I've never been to jail. That's 'cause you ain't been on the street long enough, George - Give it time. - Mm-hm. Yeah. But I'm not a criminal. None of us are, brother. Never broken God's law in my life. Always did right. Served my country, married my high school mama, raised three kids, even paid my taxes. But you lose that J-O-B, shit. I've been arrested 19 times. - Ten for jaywalkin'. - Twenty six for me. Thirty two. Well, give or take. Hey, you know who been to jail more times than any man I know? Caesar. Fifty five times. One time, they arrested him for singin' in the street. Wow. Hail, Caesar. What do you want? Just checking in. Seeing what's up. Sure, whatever. You know... I was your age when I hit rock bottom, when I realized that my anger and getting loaded weren't workin' for me anymore. - So you know what I did? - Started selling crack? I started reading... in this room in that same chair you're sitting in now. And look where you ended up. Whoop-de-doo. Must be like deja vu, huh? Mike... of all the men in this room... I look at you and I say he's the lucky one. You know why? 'Cause there are people out there who are concerned about you. Your family. Your family needs to know that you're... Mike, stop! - Stuart, you alright? - Get off of me! - Calm down! - Get off of me! Calm down! Let go! - It hurts! - Don't resist, Michael. - Bring your ass on. - Just stop. Just stop. - Don't resist, okay? - Come on, bring... - Come on. - Michael, stop! Come on, turn. You lied to me about my son. At least now you know where he is. Why did you lie to me? Could I have a minute here, please? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Why did you lie to me? A librarian's duty is to protect the privacy of the patrons. Maybe you've heard of the Connecticut Four. Yes. I've heard of the Connecticut Four. I read that appellate case when I went back to graduate school ten years ago. Goodson, your intellectual vanity is... breathtaking. These people that you're protecting, your patrons, is it worth it? Is it worth throwing your life away for? Would they do the same for you? Not on your life, pal. I've been working with drunks and addicts and the mentally ill for my entire career, all day, every day. And they're not your friends. They don't give two shits about you! All they care about is their next hit, their next bottle, their next meal, and they will beg, borrow and steal to get that from you. But you already know that, don't you? How many years did you spend on the street, Goodson? Yeah. I read that file. "A danger to himself and others." Seventy two hour psychiatric hold twice, 51/50'd twice. I wanted a second opinion. How's this gonna end, Goodson? No. Sir, no! This area's closed. What are you doing? Sir, this area's closed. - I have to get through. - You need to move your car. - I have to get through. - No, no, this area's closed. You need to move your car right now. I have supplies, I have clothing, I have food for the folks inside. Things they need to help keep them warm. Wait, you're Pastor Bradley, right? You're, you're running for mayor. That's right. Now are you gonna help me put these boxes on the curb? Here. Let's start here. Yeah. There we go. Listen, there's a lot of folks coming from the church with supplies. You have to let them through. Hey, what the hell's going on here? This is a secured area. Well, you're gonna have to tell all of them that. Excuse me. Is this where I can drop stuff off for all those people in there? Yeah, you can... you can set it here. Cool. - Do you need some help? - Sure, thanks. Thanks. - This is clothes stuffs? - And some blankets. Oh, that's so nice of you. You can put food over there by those, um, red baskets, and we'll take this here. Okay. Don't worry. I work at the library. This is gonna be the easiest way. And you, can you help me with the cars, because I don't know how... Oh, cool. This is food stuff, so... Here. Thank you. They're not comin' out of there unless we make 'em. I know. No matter how this thing goes down... we're gonna look like the bad guys. I know. Man, I always knew you was one of us. Why you ain't never tell me you was on the street? - Would it have mattered? - Hm. Reckon there's gonna be 100 angry cops at the door soon, huh? You know, there's a lot of vets in here. I can't imagine they care either way. You're all a bunch of bums, Jackson. Don't you know that? - They gonna get in. - They always do. This time, I'mma fight back. It's a fight you'll lose. Yes, that's right, we are still here live in front of the Downtown Cincinnati Public Library where the action had been unfolding on the inside but is now unfolding on the outside. Hey. Got it. What we've been seeing is ordinary citizens turning up on an incredibly chilly evening. What had been a... a staging area for local law enforcement... Hi, this is Stuart. Please leave a message. So you're really pushing the envelope, huh? You seem hell-bent on getting these guys to use whatever means necessary to get you out of there. I thought that you were smarter than this, Stuart. Do you have any idea how this is gonna end? Do you have any idea? Well, it looks like these guys... do. George? George? You wear these now. George, you wear these now and you'll be able to look at people and not hurt them with your laser eyes. - For real? - For real. Oh. See? Nobody is exploding. You're right. Now listen.
