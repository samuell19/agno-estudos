I understand that I'm dying Before death comes in search of me, I should oppose that and safeguard Par It's better I get caught to those who wish to kill me than to search for them Par shouldn't suffer for my mistake If I stay here, they would know my whereabouts wherever they are -Why are you here? -Why are you here? -You shouldn't have come here -Then come, we'll go You leave, I have some work -What work do you have without me? You first leave from here, Par. I have a work Let's first go from here. Come on, I have a work with you -You go -We got him. Come on guys! Hey, who are you guys?

[unnatundi gunde song from film Ninnu Kori playing] Dude... you fix the frame and I'll change the focus [unnatundi gunde song from film Ninnu Kori continues] Can you tell the reasons why girls fail in love? Untimed response They're hard when have to stay low and let things loose when they got to be hard They take small things seriously and go easy on serious things They move away when someone proposes love and propose their love when the other person moves away -Awesome! -Do you know why boys fail in love? You say that too Three reasons... lie, lie and lie -It's true, tell your name -Parvathi -I've got to tell you a truth -What? I love you Huh! The qualifications I expect as my friend, boyfriend or husband... are'nt present in you. Would you live with the qualifications or character? Huh? Do you like a guy who says the truth or the one lies? Obviously the guy who says truth The you like me! I don't every idiot who speaks truth. I like the one who'd be truthful only with me. Instead of getting confused by imagining unknown things about me get to know completely about me and decide -One coffee -What… Ok Huh? Ah! What's that? Not always the brain, I listen to the heart at times What did that say? -It says no Huh?

You're late I'm not late Seeing you arrive, I've been watching you without your knowledge They say girls look very cute when they sit silent You look normal even when you are silent Hmm? What if I talk? You look as silent as a heart stopped and as beautiful as the eyes can't bear Ah! Enough now. I had considered you my wife the moment I saw you. Not to waste time till marriage, I proposed love in advance. Aha! You waited half an hour for me. Why do you want to leave in half a minute? -I wanted to be with you my entire life -I'll leave now Go, but I won't leave you till you love me -You can't get me -I won't leave you till I get you -You can't get me till death -I won't leave you even if I die Ah! I wonder why do you love me so much! There may not be strong reasons for love to bloom but there'd be so many strong memories once it blooms Even before the words 'I love you' crossed my lips I imagined my life completely with you and only after getting the clarity that I can't be without you, I confessed it You know my name and job. You know my talk and behavior There's no one behind me for you to know about A small place in your heart, some time in your day, few smiles in your happiness And a few tears from your sorrow, will you share them with me?

Caste doesn't exist when the cash is sufficient sir Only those without cash need a caste I have some savings in bank, that's is for your daughter's future I love Parvathi very much. This is for your confidence Okay, you loved her. But our daughter should like you too! Girls reveal a few things even when not needed. But they don't reveal some things even when we ask them They just hide in their heart. Please ask her opinion and tell me sir I'll take leave Aunty, one... Just a single... Ah!

Tell me in an hour Looks like she'd disturb me a lot in this dress -How do I look in this dress? -I feel like carrying you -I too wish to climb over you -I'm talking about carrying in my hands I'm talk about about climbing over your back -Ok, open it, I'll climb -What?

It's here the fun begins. Oh! If you want to go reverse, pushing the break, pressing the clutch… You should hold the gear rod and slowly pull it back -Oh! -That's what driving's about I don't have the need to change gears -I'll sit sit and you change it. -Oh Hey! I'm not talking about sitting on you -I'll sit beside you. -Oh... Ah! Whatever I speak today is giving a double meaning -Turn on -Where… Sorry what? -Turn on the songs -Oh, the songs "The babe rocks, my mind's spinning and my heart is pounding" I'm hungry Par, do you have anything to eat? -I always will have two fruits -I know long back that you have two fruits -Hey, you… -I know that you always have two apples! You've turned so bad, Eshu Would anyone turn a sage once in love? -Take it -Feed it "Let's play the trumpets of love" -Change it. Change the song! -"Oh bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!" Stop the car, I'll get on the back Stop! You can climb either in the front or back. We don't have that chance It's always the driving seat. Par, why are you so angry? Eshu, don't talk to me for a while -Put it -I can't put and remove so many times You put and turn off yourself "I'm roaming astounded" "Every minute because of you" "I need kisses and romance…" "Break up! Break up!" You look forward and drive -"Break up! Break up!" -"I named Bharat am assuring you" Excuse me -You need help? -How do we go to Nandanvanam? You'll reach two hills from here, climb them and get down. You get a circle there Taking th curve there and go to center, you have a forest Going right from inside the forest, your place comes. The beautiful Nandanavanam Why do you talk filthy instead of telling the route, you son of a buffalo? -I was the route I told you madam? -Why's your voice rising? I'll kill you, rascal. You start the vehicle Eshu! Okay. "By the people, for the people, as representative" "This is me!" -"Break up! Break up!" -Why are you laughing? What did you understand? -The rule he said -Huh? Sorry, the route he said [giggles] Stop laughing [laughs] Stop laughing [giggles] Stop laughing! [bursts into laughter] Stop laughing else, I'll break your rea... Looks like today is world's filthy language day, damn Everyone is taking filth I too spoke filthy, damn! Stop the vehicle, stop… [indistinctive shouts] Par, don't get panicked. Give what they ask -Give the gold -Come on, remove -Make it fast -Give the gold fast Give the mobile, keep it there. Come out, move Get down from the car, get down Move away from here Move… Move What a babe? Hey! Stop! You're leaving it all and going. Leave the main thing, the girl and go Eshu, Eshu no You're right dude. She's precious than my life. Take this first [screams] Eshu Eshu Come on, shoot [shot fired] What if something happened to you? Saying that I love you and saying I'd give my life aren't different things Sir, we got the fourth dead body too Huh! Parvathi, you too should come to identify the dead body [cop siren] Sir... there sir He's the one who tried to molest me last night Sir, dead body floated here and the mobile was found there So, the murderer threw the dead body into water from the hill Parvathi, does this phone belong to Eshwar? Yes sir. Sir Eshwar... Take the pic from ma'am and tell the media that Eshwar is the suspect in four murders Huh? -Paravthi... -Sir Any information about Eswar, call me immediately I'll do the same, you may go now Another dead body was found 2 Km away from the three bodies already found Eshwar is the main suspect in this case as per the evidences from CC footage CI Salim Khan informed us He said the search for Eswar is on "and that they'd soon reveal the motives behind these murders" Commissioner Sir Human can't get into every remembrance he likes But the heart can Eshu, why did you bring me here? Sage in work, expert in thought, Krishna in beauty, abundant patience, Satisfaction in food and friend in joy and sorrow I wish to live as your husband like this in all the ways said in Dhrama Sastra Will you marry me? Yes You're my life from now and you're my world My bond and my responsibility Aditya! Come... [phone rings] Hello... Hello Sir, the man you showed on TV died and is moving around as ghost Where? I never expected that we both will meet. Fate brought us together We just wished not to be separated after meeting But the same fate separated us Death can separate body and life but not the heart and love My love on Par is alive... But... I'm not "Even if the world is dead" "and has turned into a graveyard" "And if I turn into a tomb" "Would someone wed a corpse?" "With no chance to live together" "I'm suffering giving up to fate" "The day I'd see you won't come again" "I'm just living a life of waiting" "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" "Let me become the call in your words" "Let me become the step on your way" "The words involving you and me" "have faded now" "You go on as yourself" Feel sweet remembrances in your heart "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" "I..." "don't exist" "I don't exist" "But I won't go away from you" I've been calling since three days, what happened Eshwar? Why are you here? You know how tensed was I? What if something happens to you? Sorry Par I said I'd never leave you and go and said I'd live with you. But leaving you alone... I died Eshu… The word love got separated into you and me And now it's just you in the word 'us'. I don't exist. Forget me and start a new life Salim, surrender me the evidence of that murder case of four and Eshwar -Why Sir? I'm going for interrogation -Just do what I say! Sir… Damn! You may be a broker, but I'm not one! Just see what I do What exactly happened that night? I was waiting for the four at Kondareddy fort Par came to me unexpectedly Those four guys attacked us while I was talking to Par Three of them dragged me in the car and one tried to molest Par After that? I tried hard to escape from them and save Par They wanted to kill and I wanted to live… I lived and killed them Then the fourth guy came to me... He was hitting me... Wait... Is there an exchange of characters in his story? He went on hitting me. Strange changes in my body. I lost my blood. My heart was about to stop. I felt I was losing my life [screams] I wanted to hold on to my life for Par. But I understood that my body was slowly losing life The tension about what may happen to Par was turning into anger I tried a lot to know about Par through him Hey! He hit me very hard with the iron rod lying there [iron rod clinks] I couldn't move and fell down. He was killing me by repeatedly hitting on my head He's taking me away from my Par. I was unable to bear it. It wasn't the pain but the gloom It was about what happened to Par and where she was More than the pain he was giving me, the pain of separation from Par was killing me He killed me... ...and I died. [thud] Where is Par? What have you done to her? [groans] [splash] [thunders rumbling] [thunders rumbling] So that's how he threw the fourth dead guy into the gorge from the hilltop Then, what is your link to the dead guys? When I was alive I thought Par was dead I killed him as I thought he killed her The brother of the guy I killed wanted to kill me To escape from there and save Par, I killed those three And that fourth guy killed me and I died [sighs] In general, the criminals drink water when Sir interrogates but this guy is making sir drink water Sir, shall I get water? -He killed you and you died, right? -Yes How come you are dead? You're telling stories sitting opposite to me! I'm neither here nor anywhere -Then, whom are you talking to? -With you -But you aren't here! -But you're here! Hmm... -Who am I talking to? -You are talking to yourself What? Don't you feel pain? -How can a dead body feel pain, idiot? -You call me an idiot? Don't you have fear? I had when I was alive [growls] I think he's dead Sir That's what I've been saying since long Ah! Ghost! -Are you possessed by some ghost? -A guy said that too! [man screams in fear] Ghost! Where's he? Hail Sri Hanuman… Where's he? Oh no Where's he? Huh? [trembles] There… Where? He vanished again… Where? [screams in fear] -Oh no, devil… -What devil? Have you gone mad? What he needs isn't interrogation, but consultation -What's your name? -Once... Eswar And now? I don't exist... how'll I have a name? Ok, you don't exist. How are your feelings after dying? I feel the world has become very small. I mean like a small room A single room? Then, where are you in that single room? -I'm nowhere -Then us? You look like the insects swarming around my corpse It's better we agree he is a dead body than agree we are insects, sir Eswar... Who is Parvathi? The life I lost... The world I lost... My bond and my responsibility Hmm... -I need to run a few tests -Okay Doctor [sighs] Whatever tests you do, no science that can bring the dead alive is born yet Frontal lobe... Temporal lobe... Occipital lobe... Parietal lobe Mortar cortex… Cells recording… Zoom it… Wait… Hmm... okay This is called as Cotard syndrome. In 1880 Jules Cotard explained this as 'The delirium of negation' Patient feels himself as dead and he believes it As this is the rarest disorder... Neither people having diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder... nor ICD 10 people can be identified. This is a neurological and psychiatric disorder related to brain When human's head is badly wounded... or when prone to unbearable mental shock, this disorder could kick in This disorder is in three stages First stage: germination That is human being in extremes of depression They feel like they lost something which can never come back They argue that they are ill although they are healthy Second stage: Blooming It means, a person loses his existence. He keeps hallucinating things. These are called delusions of negations. He believes his imaginations to be true. A person who is in this stage argues that he's dead and denies his very existence. The disease would completely turn into Cotard Syndrome. All this happened because of me. And the third and final stage is chronic. A person who believes he's dead would refrain from having food, water and sleep, and spends into extreme illusionary thoughts and unbearable depression. He gets disconnected with his blood and body organs. And after sometime, he'll die due to starvation... [gasps] ...like the patient Mademoiselle. But each case is a different study. Isn't there any treatment for this, doctor? We can try pharmalogically, but for the stage he is at, we shall do electro convulsion therapy. To put in a simple way, he should be given shock treatment. [weeps] Sir, he's a suspect in murder case. Please start the treatment immediately. Sure. [music] -Sir, shall I untie him? -No, he's a suspect. -Kishore...-Yes, uncle There is news about Eshwar on TV. The thing is that uncle... Parvathi's cell phone is switched off. What happened? Don't worry, uncle. Parvathi is with me Thanks, son. Why do you thank me, uncle? It's my responsibility to bring her safe to you. Okay, son. [phone rings] Hello. The guy who killed your brother is at the Rainbow hospital. -Come and take him if you can -Hey, I'm coming rascal! No one should know that Eshwar is being treated in Rainbow hospital. Not even to the people of our department. Is that clear? This bloody policeman knows that I'd come. Damn! [music mutes voice] [bashing] [groans] Tell him my name and address. Ask him to come and take her. [thud] [tyres screech] [weeps] I plead you. Hit me anywhere but not on my abdomen. There is a small life in here. Who is it with? Is it him? What about me? [gasps] [laughs hysterically] [groans in pain] [groans in pain] If every wound on my body multiplies the strength of our love, I wish to bear any extent of pain, Eshu. The excitement which we have now is love. -What's the next excitement? -Marriage. Yes! Marriage is excitement. And the next step after the marriage is super excitement! After that? Wife, kids and family. That's the biggest excitement in life. I know what it is to have a childhood without parents. I won't let our kids undergo that. I told about my excitements in life. Now, it's your turn to reveal your excitements. [sighs] We should get married and spend two years happily. And after that, we should get divorced. Ah! Divorce? What do you mean by that? Yes. Let's get married and enjoy our lives happily for two years. And after that, let's get divorced and stay in different cities for 6 months to one year. Then, we should magically meet each other, get the same feeling when we met for the time, get connected, hold hands sitting opposite to each other, and decide to marry again. And in that marriage, I'd place our baby in your hands as a surprise gift. The photographer would click that beautiful moment. We won't get such excitement in our life again if we won't get divorced. Hello boy, is it okay? [chuckles] Which movie did you watch last night? I saw some French movie, dude. Dude? Why not call me as hubby? Ah! Well... What's the matter? You should be called as -idiot, rascal, waste fellow, douchebag… -Madam, stop now! -Your drama is super hit, sir. -Ah! [laughs] [tyres screech] Hey, I got just two tickets. -You go and watch. -Okay. -Shall we go? -Okay, let's go. -Not with you. -Ah! We both shall go. Come on. Why so? You could go with him, right? Going to the theatre with a friend is safer than going with a boyfriend. Oh! What? [people whistling and cheering]I wish to rule the world, sir. [people whistling and cheering] You should have seen his face when I said I would watch the film with you. He kept his face like burnt pan. Then, why not come with him? Oh no! Hugging, pressing, kissing… I can't do. You could tell him that you won't allow him to do such things. Girls do say no at first. If tuned a bit, we do cooperate. If tuned further, we'd dominate. -Anyway, he is an idiot! -Is it? Of course! If he had brains, he would've sent you out and sat beside me. Oh! I even grew the beard for you. Why not give a kiss at least now? Huh? You ask me to drop you at your house daily. But, what's with today, you asked me to come little further inside? Umm... There's no one in my house. -There's no one on the road too. -Hmm! Did you come all the way till here just for this? Ah! You've hit your boyfriend's ego at the place where it shouldn't be hit. -Move, we shall go inside. -Hey... Well, what will you do when there's no one in your house? Generally, I say that I surf FB, WhatsApp and YouTube but I watch only those videos. Shall I make you drink the world's best coffee? Okay. -How is it? -Super! Well, I kissed you outside, right? -Have you got tempted? -No Oh! I made you have coffee, right? -Have you got tempted? -No! [sighs] [music] "Shall I confine all the desires that are being born inside me?" "Shall I go ahead with all the imaginations in me?" "I wish we shall get closer and own each other" "The farther you go, the closer I get to you and turn on the heat" "Getting slipped away and getting caught as you can't hesitate to cross limits" "I'm seeing you newly and strangely" "I'll kick if you come closer and kill if you go away" "I want you to be before my eyes and keep looking at me" "I'll give my hug and I'll set you on fire if you touch me" "I want you to praise me as your Goddess" "I'll display my beauty to you and I'll become a mirror in your hands" "I'll close your mouth by offering my lips to you" "Turn around... Turn around, I'm here waiting" "You go walking into the blaze" "Round about... Round about..." "I was set ablaze with a match stick traced on your fingertips" "As and when I say and wherever I say," "I will hug you, make you dance, sing and tease you" "I'll attack over my man and capture him and rule over the body" "I'll kick if you come closer and kill if you go away" "I want you to be before my eyes and keep looking at me" "I'll give my hug and I'll set you on fire if you touch me" "I want you to praise me as your Goddess" "I'll display my beauty to you and I'll become a mirror in your hands" "I'll close your mouth by offering my lips to you" [music] Ah... Ah! What's the matter? There are no words such words as 'you' and 'me' from now. It's just the word 'us'. -Love you. -Love you too. Mwah! [door opens] [gasps] [closes door] [knocking on the door] Hello Parvathi Hey Dharani! -I did a mistake -What do you mean? [knocking on the door] I believed that Sharath is a good guy. But he turned out to be a fraudster. What are you talking? Don't worry. I got cheated. What happened? Sharath brought me to some remote location on the pretext of his birthday. He asked me to fulfil his and his friends' wishes. He threatened to kill me if I don't do so. I'm very frightened. Where are you now? [door opens] [disconnected tone] -Hello, I'm very frightened Eshu-What happened? Dharani told that Sharath threatened to kill her. Is it? I have filed a police complaint. Alright. Just be careful in his matter. -Okay, love you. -Love you too. Dharani is pursuing her under graduation in Ashram orphanage. The administrators of the orphanage are shocked at Dharani's death. As a complaint was filed on a guy named Sharath, the police took him into custody and are enquiring him. They've sent Dharani's dead body for postmortem and collecting the evidences. Girls easily trust boys if they go behind them for ten days in the name of love. And they'd secretly get married without informing anyone. Boys change girls after their needs are met, but they stick to their words. Dad, it is my belief that Eshwar is in love with me for real. It's my responsibility too... ...to make you believe in him by clearing your suspicion on him. Bro... Bro... I have no call balance, can you give me your phone? I have an urgent call to make? -Take. -Thanks, dude. Hello. I've almost reached. I'm coming directly to the house. Will your body cooperate tonight? Ah! -Bro, it shows as 'wife'. Can I continue? -Okay. Sorry... Sorry, don't mind. [bus honking] -Yes, Par. Tell me.-Eshu, where are you? The bus just reached Kurnool station. I'm getting down. A lot of things happened when you were not in the city. Come home urgently, Eshu. I'm coming. [bus honking] Auto… Auto… Bro, please stop. -Sir, where to go? -Nandyal check post. Okay, get in. What might have happened? Is it the matter of Dharani and Sharath? -Bro, please drive faster. -Okay, sir. [door opens] [door opens] [weeps] [pants] [groans] I never expected that Eshu will lose himself for the mistake I did on that day. [machine beeping] How is he, doctor? -All the vitals are stable. -Okay. He'll be fine after he comes conscious. Thank you. -Doctor! -Eshu. -Ah! -Doctor! - Eshu, why are you talking so, Eshu? I'm your Par, Eshu. -Doctor -Eshu... Please, look at me. You are not my Par... My Par. -You're cheating me. -No, I'm alive. -Doctor -Oh no! I'm your Par, Eshu. -Hey, what happened? -Hey Kishore, who is this? Here... Doctor, what happened to me? -Why am I here? -Eshwar, cool down. Nothing had happened to you. We just gave you saline. Who the hell is she, doctor? Why is she here? -Doctor, what happened to him? -Hey Kishore, who is this? Hey, you're getting confused. She is our Par. -Eshu, I'm your Pari! -No, all of you are cheating me. -Why will I cheat you? -My Par… My Par… This is… - Leave her [strangles] Eshwar, no... No... Hold him... Hold him... Eshwar, leave her. -[groans] -Hold him tight. -Get the sedative. -Hey, stop man! -Hold him tight... -Eshwar... -This girl... -Calm down... [groans] Cool down... Cool down... Cool down... -No, Kishore... -She is our Par... -Eshwar… -Eshwar… [panting] -Hey! -Stop dude! [pants] Take him to bed. His health condition is normal. But he still didn't come out from shock. Let us put him back in his routine life and observe. Give this sedative if he behaves violently again. Okay. It is safe that you keep away from him till he gets normal. Where are you going? I'm asking you. I'm going to Eshwar, dad. He too said that he would live with me together if I accept his love or die if I don't accept. Neither did he change nor his words. But how can you advise me to change my ways, dad? He might have fallen in love with you for real. But, how can I send you when your life would get into danger? You are not allowed to go. It doesn't matter if something happens to me. But it's on me to take care of him that nothing happens to him. You are not allowed to go anywhere. What's that, dad? Didn't you say that it's boys who cheat girls? If I don't go now, isn't it a girl cheating a boy? Do you want your daughter to cheat, dad? I'm telling you as a mother... Just go to him, dear. Don't abandon the guy who loved you dearly, for our sake? Alright, go dear. [music] [tyres screech] [door creaks open] "I don't exist without your companionship" "Don't leave me, my friend" "There isn't a place I can't see you," "the distance is too far" "Though I'm before your eyes," "can I face you?" "You're the pupil of my eye" -"and I'm like your mom to put you in lap" -Ask him to take these medicines. Today is world's mother's day. Hence I've fixed this day as your birthday. This is the first birthday wish I have ever heard in my life. I'm so lucky. Every man wishes for a wife who is like his mother. I don't know my mother. But my wife takes care of me even like a mother. Happy birthday to my baby, Eshu! [music] "Why is the glow in the eyes" "seen like a lamp" "and gets melted to flow as tears?" "All the journey that is taking place" "stops at the friend" "It won't take close or drive away," "Only the pain is left behind" "I've done my part of the help" "but you've carried my pain" Why are you here? -What work do you have here? -Eshu, I'm your Par. I should tell you something. Have you come to cheat? [glass shatters] [groans in pain] "I don't exist without your companionship" "Don't leave me, my friend" "There isn't a place I can't see you," "the distance is too far" "Though you aren't in front of my eyes," "you are the boon all over me" "You're the pupil of my eye" "You are like a mother who consoles me" "and put me on your lap" [weeps] Par, what happened? Kishore, look at this. He loves me so dearly in his heart. But I'm in front of him and he hates me so badly. I can't bear this, Kishore. -What's this dude? -Nothing -What are you doing? -A small injection. You relax! [dials] [dialer tone ringing] -Hello, doctor-Hello Eshwar behaved violently again. -I gave the injection you've prescribed.-Let him sleep. I have an idea. Whatever happened to Eshwar on that day, plan that incident again. [phone rings] [gasps] Eshu, where are you? The bus just reached Kurnool station. I'm getting down. A lot of things happened when you were not in the city. Come home urgently, Eshu. I'm coming How did I come here again? Sir, where should you go? -Nandyal check post. -Okay, get in. This looks like this incident had already happened. Why is it happening again? [door opens] [door opens] [gasps] [weeps] Boo! You fell for it, aren't you? You fell for it, aren't you? [door opens] [laughs] He fell for it, didn't he? You fell for it, aren't you? You fell for it! Wouldn't I? Come on, dude. How can you support, dude? Hey... The thing is that... She was doing it for fun and… For a moment, -I've felt as if I lost my life -Eshu! [weeps] I'm sorry, Eshu... I could make Eshu believe that I'm alive, but I couldn't identify the problem he got from shock. You don't worry, dear. Your mother won't let anything happen to you. [singing lullaby] I came to know that Par is alive, but I couldn't say I was going away from her. [music] What is that surprise? Ah! Will I reveal it so easily? Then? -What will I get? Huh? -Ask me what you want? Hmm! What is it? Whenever I ask for what I like, you should give me without refusing. Alright. First, tell me what's the surprise. -Shall I? -Tell me. -Shall I? -Tell me, dear. -Shall I? -Tell me, dear. I'll tell you after I get back from the washroom. Alright, go. Ah... In the meantime, try guessing it. Hmm... -Hmm. -[chuckles] Marriage is not a surprise because we are already done with the main thing. Then, what'd be the surprise then? Ouch! -Who the hell are you? -Come out and you'll know. Why is he here? I should first catch this fellow. Hey! [fighting sounds] I shouldn't get caught to this guy. Where did he go? [tyres screeching] [tyres screeching] [tyres screeching] Whose men are they? Tell me... Tell me... [groans] They are the henchmen of Sharath's elder brother. I didn't know on that day that the guy who obstructed me on the road would obstruct me in my life too. [honking] I took a backstep on the road, but not in life. Par acted as if she was dead to prove my love to her parents. I believed it for real and was in a shock. And I thought it was Sharath who killed her as she filed a police complaint against him in regards with Dharani's murder case. But Sharath killed Dharani, not Par. I've purposely trapped an orphan as there is no one to bother if she is alive or dead. But for the first time in my life, I've hung my head in shame in front of my brother because of Parvathi. It is because I didn't handle it well, but not out of guilt. -Please, please leave me Sharath... -Where will you go? Wait... Police said that the case won't close until she shuts her mouth. Hey! Hey, it seems she's in her lover's flat. Shall we send even Parvathi to her friend's current stay? -Let's go. -Okay. -Who are you? - I'm waiting for you to come out on bail. -What do you want? -Your life. -Huh! Life? What will you do with that? -You've killed my Par! Killed her? I'm actually going now to kill her. I'll kill even you if you come in my way. Will you kill? [groans] Hey! Hey! Hey! [groans] Hey! Hey! Sharath, you said that you loved me and you'd marry me... Marriage? Huh! [sobbing] If I marry all those I loved, my score would've crossed 100 by now. What do you say, dude? Hey! -Sharath, don't harm me. I beg you... -[laughs] [gasps] I beg you, please… Leave me, Sharath. Where will I let you go? Cooperate with us and you'll enjoy. She did too much dude, I finished her. [game sounds in mobile] -I didn't kill her. -Why are you lying? -Hey! -What I'm saying is true. Hey, don't kill me. Even that girl would've pleaded so much. [indistinct voice] Did you let her go? You've killed her! You've killed her! [strangling] -Sir, do you have doubt on anyone? -No. Hmm. Police didn't arrest me though I killed Sharath. It means his brother targetted me personally. He sent his men to kill me and they won't stop with me. [phone ringing] I can understand that I'm dying. But before death comes in search of me, I should fight it and save Par. -Sir, SI sir is calling. -You go. -He called you both, sir. -Did he called both of us? He is tied and is not in a position to move too. I'll take care, you can go. -Sir, you go. I'll take care. -Okay, let's go. [door creaking] Eshwar… Get up dude. [machine beeping] The henchmen of Sharath's brother took away Par. I tried a lot to stop them, but couldn't her. Save Parvathi somehow. They'd kill that poor girl for your mistake. I acted well, didn't I? Hey! We both saw the girl at the same time. But you've expressed your love a minute ahead of me and became her boyfriend. And I remained as her friend due to getting delayed by a minute. But I too have the same feelings like you. Anyways, you are mentally dead. And if you also die physically in his hands, it is good for me and to him as well. Actually, I can hand you over and get Paru. But if I do so, Par would develop a negative opinion on me. That's why, I'll release you from here. [machine beeping] [sobbing] [music] He can let go of the girl but for letting the guy go, he consider it as our mistake. Where might he have taken her? [car door opens] [vroom] [sighs] Go now. They'll take care of you. And I'll take care of Par. It might take some time. But I'll definitely impress and marry her. I've already impressed her father. [whimpers] Hey... Control! Control yourself. I'm not the reason for your problems or his revenge. I just used your situations in my favour and took advantage of them. That's all. So, no hard feelings! Die peacefully, at least. Happy journey. [vehicle starts] I know that I don't exist. But I'm still alive. I should move this body to save my life. [music] [screams] [gate creaks] [mumbles] Your revenge is only on the guy who killed your brother, right? Let her go. She is the one who is responsible for his death though it is you who killed him. You should see her pain and she should watch us killing you. She is yours if you cross me and my men. -Hey! -[groans] [thud] Hey! [groans] [mumbles] Death can separate a soul from the body, but not the heart from love. Hey! [gasps] Guys… [roaring] Hey! [groans] [groans] [groans] Hey... [shatters] [yells] [groans] [cleaver swishes] [slits] [yells] [yells] [groans] [slits] [slits] [yells] [groans] [slash] [groans] [mumbles] [blood drips] [pants] [music] [groans] [cleaver clangs] [groans] [thud] [yells] Hey... Hey! [clangs] [yells] [metal rods clang] [groans] [groans] [thud] [groans] [music] Eshu... [gasps] [stabs] [gasps] [groans] Hey... [clangs] [groans] What's wrong with you, dude? I've buried our friendship to gain her love. You have survived and killed my love. That's why I wanted to kill you. [clangs] [groans] [groans] Eshu... Par... Par... Par... [breathes] Eshu Stop... Stop the car Nothing will happen to you, Par... [breathing heavily] -Eshu, stop the car. -Let's go to the hospital first, Par. Eshu, just stop the car... [tyres screech] Eshu... I said I have a surprise for you. Remember it? Yes. Shall I say what that is? Tell me... Shall I? Yes. You are about to become a father and I'm about to become a mother. Oh! You've promised me that you'd do whatever I ask for and whenever I wish for? Will you stick to your words? -Are you? -Yes, I will. Are you going to do that? Yes, I will. -[groans in pain] -Par, nothing will happen. Let's go to hospital. Will you return my Eshwar who loves me very dearly, alive? [music] [tyres screech] [vehicle halts] [car doors open] They are out of serious condition. -Thanks. -It's okay. Sir, I didn't understand this case since the beginning. What exactly happened, sir? He's living in the illusions that I'm dead. But you're alive, aren't you sir? -It's him, not me. -Hmm... He's alive in the illusions that he's dead and saved his lover from dying. And we've saved both of them who were on the verge of dying. I didn't understand any at all, sir. -Do you watch Telugu films? -Yes, sir. Then, I'll narrate clearly like the climax of Telugu films. Listen. Both are alive and both will live together. I've a small doubt, sir. What again, man? He should be in jail for committing multiple murders, but how will he live together with that girl, sir? He didn't do these murders with intentionally. As he did those murders due to his unstable mental condition, he would be sent to a mental rehab center. They will treat him and discharge him. So, it is a happy ending. No! It's a happy beginning. -I don't exist -Hmm... I mean I don't exist in the frame. Yashika, smile!
