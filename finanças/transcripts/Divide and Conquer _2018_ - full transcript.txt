I think there was a real terror inside of Roger. This wanting to be liked, wanting to be somebody. He said, I'm writing a book about my life for my son because when I go, people are going to say awful things about me and I want him to know that that's not all his dad was. I think Roger thought he could control the little genie in the bottle and he couldn't and here we are. It's easy to make somebody into a monster. It's hard to see that you're on that path too. We are about four hours away from history here in Cleveland. A man with no previous political experience, a real estate mogul, a reality TV star, a millionaire businessman is about to take his place at the top of the GOP presidential ticket. It was a big moment of triumph for Fox News. Joe, what an amazing moment. This is emotional. It was unthinkable that Donald Trump as a candidate would exist without them. About an hour from now, mister Trump and his family will arrive here via his helicopter and they will quite literally hover over our cameras. It was like a hall of mirrors. You couldn't look anywhere and not see Roger. He had his people everywhere operating behind the scenes. People who were extremely loyal to him and who would defend him with every little weapon they had in their arsenal. He was the king. A powerful, influential person who changed the country. And the Republican Convention should have been this crowning moment for Roger. But instead he was embroiled in chaos. Actually if you'd stand by David, we're going to hold you over to the next block and I'll tell our viewers at home why. It's because we have some breaking news to tell you about here. This is very big news from the world of politics, the world of media. And the is that Roger Ailes has now resigned as chairman and CEO of the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. The man who created conservative leaning Fox News two decades ago was forced out over allegations of sexual harassment. I'm Gretchen Carlson. Journalist Gretchen Carlson taking on Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes. Ailes called Carlson's allegations offensive and defamatory and said that they would be vigorously defended. He's said we are going to blow these people out of the water. We are going to destroy them. And she'll be sorry she ever started this thing. Roger is the man who almost single handedly built Fox News Channel from absolutely nothing into the most watched news operation in all of cable. Revolutionary in American politics, shaper of American history. Was in the Nixon White House, worked on the re-election campaign for Ronald Reagan. You could really credit Roger Ailes with helping to create three Republican presidents. I could not be more proud tonight to present to you our next president, Donald J. Trump. It's ironic that on the eve of Donald Trump's coronation as the Republican nominee, the ultimate Republican king maker Roger Ailes was to have his kingdom taken away. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, mister Donald J. Trump. Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes First, I want to put a disclaimer here. Anything I say tonight is my fault. I don't speak for Fox News and I'm not speaking for Rupert Murdoch. I take full and complete responsibility because nobody else wants it, frankly. My personal view is we have a desperate need to return to the basics. Common sense things we all learned as kids. God, family, country. Pay the bills, work hard, help your neighbor. The New York and Hollywood elites, they think their job is to drag the rest of the redneck morons toward the light. They don't understand the people that grew up with values. I first met Roger Ailes in junior high school. In civics class, we would have debates about like the race between Eisenhower and Stevenson and I was a closet Stevenson person. But the arguments that Roger would make in favor of Eisenhower were so persuasive that I thought, I don't agree with you but I see your point. We all wanted to be like Roger. He was witty and intelligent, mercilessly funny. Also, Roger was the handsomest young man you can imagine. Warren was a beautiful, clean, wonderful city. Everywhere you look, there was something historic or you know, traditional or patriotic. And you felt it. It was part of being from Warren, Ohio. Roger's father was a factory foreman and he was a very important figure to him. He's like one of those prophets from the Old Testament. Very stern. My dad was a tough guy. He hit us with a belt. Did your dad hit you with a belt? I was terrified but I love my dad. His father was a union man who hated the unions. Who who was frightened of the unions. He said to Roger, mark my words. Liberals will destroy this town. Now, it's unfair to say that they did that, but in the 70s, that prophecy came true. And Roger saw all the industry move out. Their livelihood was gone overnight and he saw the pride that people had disappearing too. Roger lived his whole life in fear. A physical real fear of bleeding to death. Had hemophilia diagnosed when he was about four years old. But he was a survivor and he operated fearlessly like a lot of people who have real fears often do. I had a condition that was passed through women. In other words, the mother has to give you hemophilia. I don't know that that had anything to do with it but I was never particularly physical with my mother. I think she was scared of it. She may have had some feeling about the fact that I got it from her. Roger's daily life was a fear of annihilation. He said, it's like you walk around all your life with a time bomb in you. And I think this allowed him to understand the fears of other people. You're in danger, I'm in danger. We're at war and this is not going to stop. We gotta understand what's in our country and take out the people that want to see us die. You're seeing them come out of the shadows, come out of the cave. Picture is really shocking. Jihad right here on our own soil. This is the ultimate battle of good versus evil. We need to kill them. We need to kill them. If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you? I used to be a production assistant for Mike Douglas. I ran sandwiches for the stars and I moved up quickly. I learned if your audience likes you, they'll forgive just about everything else you do wrong. The Mike Douglas Show was the only daytime talk show at that time. And we did it five days a week, live. I co-created the Mike Douglas Show and I booked all the big stars. Every actor in a movie, a lot of directors would come through, plus there were animal acts, and obviously there were a lot of dieting segments and that sort of thing. - Oh, something's on fire here. - It'll go out. It was just fun. Roger was an associate producer on the show and a guy named Larry Rosen, who's really next in line to be the producer. He was the first producer hired. He'd been on the show the longest next to me and it was obviously going to be Larry. Roger convinced Mike that he would be the better producer than Larry. And Roger became the producer of the Mike Douglas Show. And that was a big shock because you couldn't see him maneuvering. The only person that I saw Roger Ailes ever really hit on was Richard Nixon. In 1968 during the presidential campaign when he was going to be running against Bobby Kennedy, Nixon came to Philadelphia, because like all politicians, he recognized the impact that the Mike Douglas show had on millions of people. You look wonderful. Your sun tan, you're rested looking. Yes. Have you ever regretted entering politics at such a an early age? No. Politics of course is a great battle. - All of life is great battle. - Yes. After the show is over, Roger pulled Nixon into his office just the two of them and said you need a media adviser. What's a media adviser Roger? And Roger said "I am". "The title that I just created, okay." You need someone that can shape you that can make you presentable and the most palatable you can possibly be and get you elected president. And Nixon believed him. So Roger very soon after left the show and went off to produce Richard Nixon. Let's face it. A lot of people think Nixon is dull. They think he's a bore, pain in the ass. We have a sound dollar. They look at him as the kind of kid who always carry the book bag. Who was 42 years old the day he was born. They figure other kids got footballs for Christmas. Nixon got a briefcase and he loved it. Nixon needed someone who had knowledge of and command of the use of television. And that of course was reinforced by what had happened in 1960. That was the Nixon-Kennedy debate where Nixon loses to Kennedy because he sweats on television. He looked bad. He had not put on makeup. And even his own mother was calling in and asking how her son was. Was he okay? And of course Kennedy went on to become president. So Roger told Nixon if you don't take television seriously this time you're going to lose again. I'm going to fire this fucking director right after the show. I mean, look at the positioning of these cameras. I told him 50 times I want close ups. Close ups! I want to see faces. I want to see pores. That's what people are. That's what television is. I don't give a fuck about the seats. I gave up 30 seats to get a tight show. Roger and I had had many conversations about the power of the media and particularly the great Nazi propaganda film by Leni Riefenstahl, Triumph of the Will. And I talked to Roger a lot about the specific camera angles that she used to make Hitler seem heroic. And about putting it in the right kind of setting, which made it so powerful. And Roger told me really thought about that when we created for Nixon the man in the arena. Tonight from Philadelphia, live and in color, Nixon in Pennsylvania. Tonight, Richard Nixon in person is going to face a panel of citizens asking the questions they want answered. He put him in the arena surrounded by the audience and it was an amazing propaganda piece. I'd like to stress the point that this is a live program. No one has any idea what questions will be asked. Mister Nixon cannot possibly know. Tonight from Atlanta, the Nixon answer. You have to have the big stroke for the federal government in order to handle a particular problem like that. Richard Nixon. We've got the power. We've got a wonderfully motivated people. Richard Nixon. TELEVISION AND POLITICS Good evening, I'm Mike Wallace. For better or worse, television has changed the nature of the political process in the United States. This year, another innovation was tried, the controlled discussion with the questioners picked by the candidates producer. Roger Ailes was that producer and in the book The Selling of the President, he was given a good share of the credit for the successful format. In your estimation, is television the single most important factor in a winning political campaign? Let me put it this way, I don't believe anyone will ever be elected to a major public office again, including mayors of big cities without the skillful use of television. And that skillful use, is that an illumination of the issues or an emotional cell of the man involved. I think both. I think both. I don't think you can isolate one or the other. I think that there's an emotional reaction to what you see on the screen regardless of what it is. When I was first reporting on Fox News, everyone knew what Roger Ailes history was, that he was an aide to Nixon and and other Republican presidents but it was kind of below the radar. So, I filed information requests with the Nixon Archives. One of the things that I discovered was this astonishing document called "A plan to put the GOP on TV". Its author is unclear. However, the copy that I obtained had Roger Ailes handwriting all over it and notes that were directed to H. R. Haldeman, a top aide in the Nixon White House. And the memo said the Liberal Elite has a choke hold on the national news networks. But local television stations in Wisconsin and in Utah have their own news programs and they are hungry for footage. So it was a proposal that the Nixon White House with taxpayer dollars fund an operation that would interview Republican members of Congress in Washington and fly the footage to these local stations so that they can get a message out to their constituents without having to rely on the institutional press. And Roger Ailes is all over it saying I can do this. Now, it never happened, but the idea, the germ goes straight into what Fox News is all about. How do we get a message to the people without having to go through a critical press? I think that Roger was a kind of genius in the sense that he created something that didn't exist before and I think that there is a "Citizen Kane" quality to his life. And I remember he told me this story that when he was a boy he and his brother had bunk beds and Roger was on the top bunk and his dad walked in and opened up his arms and said jump, Roger, jump and Roger jumped and his father stepped away and Roger fell on the ground. And his father looked down on him and he said, don't trust anybody. And I still have an image of Roger's face when he would tell me that. I felt like he was searching. He was like, how could my dad do that to me? So there was a lot of anger. There was a lot of anger. And I think he capitalized on that. Al D'Amato, a family man fighting... Deukmejian, the difference is leadership. I'm Dan Quayle, I'm very optimistic about our future. Ailes Communications did political media consulting for congressional races, senatorial races, gubernatorial races. When we were a small team doing 14 races in 14 different states simultaneously. We did a lot of executive coaching and we did political coaching. And because of the Nixon campaign and the fact that he had pulled that thing off, you were lucky to get him and you had to keep him happy. As Jefferson County Judge, Mitch McConnell won national recognition for exceptional leadership. Mitch McConnell was a judge. He was way down in the poles. He was going to lose. And Roger was hired to do a bunch of commercials. So we were doing a fishing spot and we had him in the boat, fishing rod in hand. We put a worm and a fish on the hook, reeled it into the water and then we hear this little voice go, "what do I do now, Rog?" And it was Mitch McConnell and Roger looks at me and I look at him and Roger says, you know, reel in the fucking fish, Mitch. Mitch didn't move without listening to Roger. And a month later, he's a US senator. I'm here with Roger Ailes who has been called the Ernest Hemingway of campaign advisers. The bearded veteran of many political wars, Roger Ailes, arrived early this morning for a final day of practice. From 1984 to 1988, Roger was the absolute number one Republican strategist. Roger Ailes, former TV man for Nixon, was seen here in South Dakota this fall. We were in every state in the country and Roger was a pivotal figure in getting Ronald Reagan elected. He was like a king maker. And he knew that he could blow his opponents out of the water and that's what he did. ROGER AILES: I HAVE TO TAKE THE HEAT ALTERNATELY DEFIANT AND TROUBLED ABOUT HIS NOTORIETY I remember I came into the office one day and he said you may have to take over for a few days, because I was arrested. I was carrying a gun in Central Park, so I may go to jail. And I didn't know he had a gun but Roger was he was a Maverick, he was a bad boy and he liked that. I know you've heard people are afraid of me. I don't remember threatening anybody but if somebody comes to me looking for a fight, they might get one. My dad taught me how to fight. He said, remember son, for them it's a fight, For you, it's life or death. And now to tonight's focus 88 coverage of the race for the White House. President Reagan is stomping in Texas trying to help the George Bush for president campaign. An NBC News Wall Street Journal call shows Dukakis beating Bush by 15 points in a head to head. Try it with the glasses. Bush is already initiated damage control. Big Rog, how are you? Glad to see you. First thing I did was with George H.W. Bush. Roger was reading him out for a production manager and when I realized what it was which was, which was Republican commercials, I said I don't think I really want this I was always very liberal, but I needed a job. What's going on? Vice President Bush was a real gentleman and I don't think he understood the down and dirty, the world that Roger could relate to. Roger always knew the lowest common denominator in people. He knew how to strike at that. And I think that's why George used Roger. He needed a bulldog. He needed somebody who could play that game. And that might have been the beginning of it of the negative really negative ads. Which candidate for president gave weekend passes to first degree murderers who were not even eligible for parole? Michael Dukakis. Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison. One was Willie Horton who murdered a boy in a robbery stabbing him 19 times. Despite a life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes from prison. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend. Weekend prison passes. Dukakis on Crime. The message of the Willie Horton ad was if you elect Michael Dukakis, he's going to let all these black men out of prison to come and stab your children, rape your wives. - Do you think it's racist? - No, I don't think it's racist. I think the man I see there is neither black nor white. If you put a white man up there, would that be racist? That it has that effect of scaring the difference out of white people, doesn't it? Well, the Bush campaign had absolutely nothing to do with that ad. In fact, I wish it would never have aired. He says he didn't do the first one. The most controversy ad. But he certainly promoted the entire storyline of Willie Horton and scary black men. While out, many committed other crimes. It was revolutionary at the time and it worked. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. There are only a handful of people who can so critically affect the power in this country over decades and Roger is absolutely one of them. And when you think about the people who are running a country even now, all these senators and congressman, he put them there. That's definitely Roger. Because his stories about Nixon or everybody else. It was what he did for them. How he made them. You know, without them they would not be where they are. And so everyone wanted to be in his sphere. Everybody. You know he was the big guy right? Did he take advantage of that? I don't I don't know. I don't know. Everybody has an agenda. He used to say that a lot and you have to see what it is that they're after and then you can manipulate them that way. I think he liked to pick on the people who needed him, who were vulnerable. Not just women, but women were easy targets. You know, and anybody who looked up to who wanted to be there, you know, who thought, oh, I'm at the top of my game if I'm working with Roger. Like Judy, his secretary, she worshiped him and I knew anything I said to her was basically talking in his ear at the same time. Was she his mistress then? I can't say that I saw it specifically, but there were, I mean, it seemed a universal acceptance that everybody knew it and it was just a giggle. His wife, Norma, was already staying at home a lot. She'd do a little bit in the editing room and stuff but Judy was in constant contact with her. And I think that he kind of liked that he could sort of play the mistress off of the wife and the wife off of the mistress. I think he was very insecure and he needed that feeling of having a harem. It was like, look at me. Look at me. I got em both and they do what I want them to do. My assistant can look at a room and say, watch the fourth guy on the left, he hates your guts. Oh, she can read a room. She goes in, she's very friendly. Asks if they want coffee and they think she's the secretary, but she's reading the room before I go in. I was a big fan of Roger Ailes. I had read his book and in my industry, he was the man. My husband was working with CNBC and he said, Roger Ailes is coming in. Would you like to meet him? So, I thought that sounded wonderful. We met in a restaurant at Union Station and had a nice meeting and I mentioned to Roger that I was going to sign a contract with one of the big national committees and this is a career making contract. Once you hit that level, you'd made it. But once we got into his car, we're barely pulled away from Union Station and he leaned over and said, you know, I can really help you but if you want to play with the big boys, you have to lay with the big boys. It just came out of nowhere and it was very transactional. So one point I sort of sarcastically said, well now, would I have to be anybody else's special friend? And he said, well, you might have to give a few blowjobs here and there but everyone will know you're with me. And a million thoughts were going through my head. How do I get out of this? Because I didn't want to offend him and risk some kind of struggle in the backseat. So I just said I'm I'm going to think about it and I'll get back to you. And he said well you know if you don't agree now there's a good chance you won't later on and I said well we're just going to have to take that risk. So I dropped him off and I was just remember shaking on the way back, Why did that happen? Why do I have to put up with that? Why? So the next morning thought that's behind me. I'm not going to see him again. So I went to the national committee for my meeting which I had confirmed the day before and I got to the the front desk and he said oh he's busy. That's strange. And the next day I got a call from Roger Ailes at home. And he said how does your meeting go? And I said well, very strangely, it it didn't happen. And he said no you'll probably hear from them. What did you decide? And I said I'm going to have to pass Roger. It's just not something I'm comfortable with. And he said okay that's that's fine. Good luck with everything. I said, yeah, fine. Okay good. So I hung up and didn't really think a whole lot more about it. Except I wasn't getting any of my calls returned to the national committee. And after a couple weeks I thought there's something wrong here, so I asked a friend to ask around and he called me back very quickly afterwards and said you're on a "no hire list". A "no hire list"? And then all of a sudden it all fit into place. That's what Roger had done. And that was the end of my career. If you want to have tremendous political influence. And still be a womanizer, drug abuser, or an alcoholic, you only have one choice of career and that's journalism. Because journalists won't attack each other. They only attack all the rest of us. And anybody who denies it is lying. A NEW FORM OF NEWS. AMERICA'S TALKING. Well, I first met Roger Ailes in the early 90s when he was starting a all-talk network called America's Talking. You know, I think Roger wanted to be known during this time as a incredible TV executive, not a politician. I congratulate Roger on his new position as Geraldo Rivera's boss. I'm politically correct now. It was an image thing that he really wanted to bury his political past. First I want to ask you why a talk network, you know, it seems that talk shows a come and go, the networks are saturated with them, why does this seem a good direction to go? There is a certain segment of our society who really want to watch other Americans talking about things they care about and I think you're going to see a big audience develop for this kind of thing. America's Talking, a new form of news. America's Talking was Roger's baby and every single host, every single show idea was from Roger's mind. He created 12 hours of TV live. That's almost insane. And I was saying horrible hideous stuff about how some women are able to ejaculate like men. Roger didn't care. As long as the show was juicy and interesting and he was all for. Hello, I'm Terry Anzur. Short skirts were encouraged and on America's Talking, I had a see-through desk. And underneath were lights that shined on my legs. They didn't put the light on Chris Matthews' legs. - Good night, Chris. - Good night. You know, when I look back at America's Talking, I realized that there was so much that you saw on Fox later on. The mainstream media in America is biased and abusive. A lot of people don't know that Sean Hannity started on America's Talking covering the OJ trial. Hello, I'm Bill O'Reilly, thank you for watching. And Bill O'Reilly was doing Inside Edition. He would fill in for Roger every once in a while and that's really how they got to know each other. But I think deep down inside Roger wanted to be in front of the camera. In fact American's Talking gave himself a show. Straight Forward with Roger Ailes. My staff told you I didn't want the drag queens. Did they tell you that? It's cross-dressing. It's been going on since the Mona Leo. I know. I'm for instance a female. You would never guess that. - I've lived this. - That would be okay. We'll be right back with the first brother, Roger Clinton. Stay with us. Big Roger loves show business. Just love the spotlight. He used to take tap dancing back in those days for exercise and I think that's who Roger really wanted to be. Right now, everybody thinks I'm the greatest guy in the world. I'm sure you've heard that a lot. My doctor told me I'm old, fat, and ugly but none of those things is going to kill me immediately. Everybody fears the unknown but I have a strong feeling there is something bigger than us. Beth Tilson was a CNBC executive who was promoted to help run America's Talking. Before then, it was always Roger and Judy, Roger's assistant. You know, he almost said the two names in the same breath in a lot of ways. Then, it was Beth and Roger. Beth was a cross between Marilyn Monroe and a school mom and had eyes for only one person and that was Roger. Oh, the wedding. Beth had a white suit with fur, very elegant. Roger was in black. Giuliani was the officiant and it was just me and Barbara Walters and Geraldo was there and Roger, he was so happy. We reached the magic number of 20 million subscribers. And all of a sudden it wasn't Roger's little playground anymore. NBC went "Wow. This is a real channel." And we should be getting more value out of it. Now, the story goes that Bill Gates wanted a news network. So, he approached NBC with his chatbook and NBC said, we've got this network over in Fort Lee called America's Talking. It's yours. A new partnership between NBC and Microsoft is heating up the media wars. The two companies have announced a new 24-hour worldwide cable TV news channel. It is called MSNBC and NBC President Bob Wright says he hopes to have it up and running by summer. I got a phone call from a friend of mine saying, your friend Roger threw a chair across the room, called the car, and stormed out of the building. So I called Roger in his car and I said hey I heard something went down. Are you okay? And he said "Felycia I'm going to fuck them." I'm going to fuck them like they've never been fucked before. And I knew something would be born out of this need for revenge. Thank you very much for your attendance at such a short notice. I just like to say how delighted I am that we've now reached this moment when we can firmly announce the starting of a Fox News Channel. We've been very lucky in being able to obtain the services of mister Roger Ailes who has had such a fantastic success. Mister Ailes is here and he might like to add a few words but we'll be ready to take your questions. It really is exciting to join what I think is the most dynamic television company in the world today and I've always admired mister Murdoch's ability to get things done. It's a tough competitive world but we intend to be when the music stops to have a chair. The all news game has become a serious and a nasty business. As media mogul Rupert Murdoch enters the 24 hour news competition with his Fox News channel. CNS Ted Turner insisted he would squish the Australian tycoon like a bug. Rupert had wanted to launch something like Fox News for years. He loved taking on taboos in his tabloids in London and had always wanted to puncture the establishment. They wanted us to beat the crap out of the other cable channels at their own game and about 10 weeks before Fox actually went on the air Roger had all of us in the company come to New York and he gave this rip roaring speech about how the networks had been around for so long that they were antiquated and that we were going to be a pirate ship that while everybody else were these sort of battleships and aircraft terriers that would take a long time to turn around, we were going to be nimble, we were going to strike hard and we're going to have a whale of a time doing it. Good morning, welcome to Fox News Channel. Fox News was an absolute hoot at the beginning. Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thank you for watching on our very first day. There were people who had worked with Roger at America's Talking and CNBC. And some people who work with him in a political sphere. Welcome to Washington. I'm Brit Hume. And to all of us who started was like "Yes. This is great." Well, we're going to try to be different. Stimulating and a bit daring. Loyalty was a theme that came up every day because all the people around Roger would tell us, you know, Roger really likes loyalty. Loyalty is really important to Roger and people who would do something nice for Roger would often pop up on the air. We did all sorts of segments that didn't make any sense to me. They'd say, FOR, friend of Roger. It was imparted to me right from the very beginning that it wasn't about journalism, it was about drawing the biggest audience possible. A library board in Helena, Montana voted unanimously to keep the book The Joy of Gay Sex on a library shelves. Alright, that's good. Book that for the D block on Tuesday. We used to call it riling up the crazies. That's what we're there to do. We were there to stir up outrage because that is what kept them watching. Whitewater Independent Counsel, Ken Starr is reported to have a number of audio tapes on which a former White House intern Monica Lewinsky told fellow staff that she was sexually involved with the president. They must have fallen on their knees at Fox when the Lewinsky thing hit and never stop thanking god for that blue dress. Because Roger and Beth, they despise the Clintons and everything they stood for. Bill Clinton is very slick, very glib. He has 15,000 press secretaries and it's clear she's not going to get the Betty Crocker award. Wouldn't stand too close to her. Could President Clinton have had an affair with an intern and then try to cover it up. Fox News correspondent David Shuster has the story. Yesterday, the White House released a response to Kenneth Starr's detailed report to congress. The Clinton scandal was the rocket fuel that got Fox News into the stratosphere. We were kicking the network's ass on the story. Day in and day out. Fox News has learned it was Linda Tripp who befriended Monica. And within two or three months, it was "Wow. Fox News has something going." Attorney General is now started a 90-day preliminary inquiry... ...in the United States to testify under oath that he didn't... Mr. Clinton is also accused of obstruction of justice. I remember it was a huge celebration at Fox News in New York and I was asked to come up and meet with Roger Ailes in his office. This was after we got the information about the cigars and he says, what is this sex stuff? What was really going on? And so I said, well, there's some rumors about cigars or something that was involved in their sexual play and Roger loved it. He was scintillated by it. But the idea that Bill Clinton would be sloppy, allow an intern to blab to her friend. That's where the contempt came. Because Roger Ailes did not respect people who got caught. There's someone in the room today whose wings are much bigger than mine. His wings have a wide span of generosity that every day lifts up so many people. The one and only Roger Ailes. I was beyond flattered that Roger Ailes was talking to me like this. Since 11 years old, I wanted to be a news reporter. I was working at this little local TV station and I got meeting with Roger Ailes. So, I went in there and sat at the seat across from his desk. He said, no, no, come over here and then he sat down at a couch and he patted right next to and he said, come sit right next to me. He said to me you know here at Fox News in order to be beautiful it's not just waist up, it is the entire package. People want to see a woman from you know head to toe and he looked me up and down admiringly and said you definitely are beautiful enough to be here and I said thank you and then he said but I'm not 100% sure. He said stand up and twirl for me. I want to see everything and I just looked at him and laughed. And then a week later a friend of mine had dinner with Roger Ailes at this Italian restaurant in Midtown. And he said to me Lidia he's I talked to him about you. He wasn't not serious about bringing you on. I said well what do you mean? Said he asked about you sexually. He asked what kind of girl you were and I said you're a good girl. But I think that it was in a way a test. I think I failed because I didn't hear back. An Access of Evil standoff as Fox reports tonight. Hello, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. If you wanted something, I wanted more opportunity, I wanted to try to anchor. I think that he saw that as what do I get out of that and so when I went to him to ask him for more opportunity, he said, well, I would have to work with you more closely if that were to happen. I would have to train you, give you sort of tutorials and you know people might be jealous and so we would have to we'd be best if we did it away from here, perhaps at a hotel sometime Do you know what I'm saying? And I said "Yeah, I think I do know what you're saying." I mean I knew I was never going to go meet Roger at a hotel, that was unthinkable to me. That was never going to happen, but I didn't know what was going to happen next. I think I was I was going to be fired if I didn't do it. I didn't know how he was going to make that happen. I mean Roger was the king. His assistant was the head of HR and so it didn't occur to me that there was somebody higher than Roger who could have done something. There wasn't. And weren't people in Fox News putting out salacious online material? There were many websites. I think one was called the Hot Women of Fox. There were different websites about different body parts. There were websites dedicated to feet. They wanted people to think of the network in that way. They were using the women who worked there for a very specific purpose and it was to be sexualized for their viewers and we learned later for the people in the building. And so that was the culture of the time. And there was nobody who was willing to challenge it. If Fox News is the house that Roger built with some help from Rupert Murdoch, look at this group here on the stage with you and why did you pick them? Somebody once asked me how I hire talent and there were, I made a list and there were 27 things on the list, which is a secret list, which one day will come out of the book I'm writing about all you people. All of us are veterans that we've worked for other companies and most of those companies are horror shows. This company is a little bit different because they let you... they don't micromanage and Roger Ailes hires people with whom he has confidence and then he lets them go. Alright, we have to take a break here and we're going to be back. We're going to talk about the milestones that changed Fox News and changed our country. It was October 2004. I came into work one evening, I was working the evening shift, and I look around the newsroom and every computer in the newsroom was on this website, and my buddy is, he's like, dude, you gotta read this shit. It is an absolute bombshell of an allegation. A sexual harassment case against popular cable TV host Bill O'Reilly. One of his associate producers, Andrea Mackris, alleges that in one phone conversation, O'Reilly fantasized you would basically be in the shower. I would take that little loofa thing and kind of soap up your back. I like the part about you wanting to rub falafel on that lady's boobs and the part about how you love vibrators and the part about how you believed it when a prostitute told you you had a big penis. You said on your show yesterday, this is one of the most evil things you've ever experienced. Why so evil? Why do you think she's doing this? I have no clue, but my career could be ruined and I'm very well aware of that but I can't let people do this. What was interesting about that case with Andrea Mackris is she was somebody who had evidence. Multiple recordings of what was obviously sexual harassment and also threats and intimidation. If any woman ever breathed a word, I'll make her pay so dearly that she'll wish she'd never been born. I'll rake her through the mud, bring up things in her life and make her so miserable that she'll be destroyed. If you cross Fox News Channel, it's not just me, It's Roger Ailes who after you. Ailes operates behind the scenes, strategizes, and makes things happen so that one day, bam, The person gets what's coming to them but never sees it coming. It was apparent to everyone that he was guilty but Bill O'Reilly had the highest ratings. He brought in the most money. You know, he was kind of the face of the network. So, Roger protected Bill. You know, just like Roger was Rupert Murdoch's cash cow. Bill O'Reilly was Roger Ailes' cash cow. So, he helped smooth everything over. You want the truth? You hire Bo Dietl. You want something else? Go hire slim old PI. Find the truth. That's all I do. Is find the truth. Bo Dietl is a former NYPD cop who became a regular on Fox News. Who's the go-to guy to defend Stop and Frisk or argue that Trayvon Martin deserved to die or whatever. Where was he when two officers got killed in New York? And he also had this private eye business where he worked for Roger doing security and investigations for Fox News. Well, I'll say it right now. I respected Roger Ailes because the man did so much for America and for the people of Fox. On the Mackris case, we were assigned to follow her and to gain any kind of information we could where it was detrimental to the case. They took the information that Bo Dietl was digging up and leaked it to the New York Post which was owned also by Rupert Murdoch. They said Andrea Mackris is a slut. She's a drunk. She's trying to entrap Bill O'Reilly. It's going to be a message to people. When you file these frivolous lawsuits and you think you're going to get people well-known to give you money for garbage like this. We're going to investigate you. We're going to uncover that we've already about your life so you're wide open right now. So, beware people. That was the tactic, like, smear her, put pressure on her, and as it turns out, it worked. They settled it. She can't talk and he skated. His ratings went up from there. His salary went up from there. Fox News was making so much money, no one cared. Good morning, everyone. Today is Thursday. It's September 20th. I'm Gretchen Carlson. Thanks so much for sharing part of your day with us today. So Rupert, what made you think that this whole thing would work? I just had a hunch that you know, there was a room for another point of view and then another service. Rupert Murdoch is a genius in terms of media but more importantly, what he does is he bets on people. I don't think we ever had a written business plan. I think we talked through what we're going to do and he backed it but really let me run it. Now, if I'd screwed it up, I'd be dead. Roger and Beth were extremely impressed with Rupert Murdoch. I remember one time Beth called me after we had dinner at Rupert's house. She couldn't believe the table and the table setting. They were pulled into a class and circle of people who are way above them. So they had a lot of catching up to do. Cuz Rupert was really doing what Roger had pictured himself doing. Conquering a new world. So Rupert bought the Wall Street Journal. What's the name of Roger's little newspaper? Putnam County News and Recorder. Yeah, the Putnam County News and Recorder. There you go. That says everything. BIG-TIME CABLE NEWS TO SMALL-TOWN PAPER ROGER AILES, THE CHAIRMAN OF FOX NEWS, LIKED HIS LOCAL NEWSPAPER SO MUCH HE DECIDED TO BUY IT I was actually told about the sale the night before and I think the first thing I said was "has he seen this?" Because it was a one room antiquated equipment little dinky thing. At that time it was a very typical sleepy small town weekly newspaper that reported on the school board and the town board and Cold Spring itself is 1900 people. There's definitely an air of Americana that it has that main street that's leading down to the river right across from West Point and the whole Cold Spring area is steeped in revolutionary war history. The community was shocked that this media mogul, this political kingpin would have any interest in coming to Cold Spring and buying this little weekly newspaper and we thought, you know, is he going to do with this local paper what he does at Fox News? I think Roger and Beth wanted to become Lord and Lady of the Manor. Almost worshiped in the town. Those institutional land holders are the ones we're trying to support keep that property in those hands and out of the hands of developers. Why would everybody not be equal under the law? Businesses, private... There's probably no greater position to hold than to be a citizen of the United States. First time I met him was in the Helding School cafeteria after meeting. And the first impression I had was this guy is, you know, a bully. Let's not get out of hand. We're not going to get crazy here tonight. We're here to hear your concerns and answers your questions. He was convinced we were going to tell him he couldn't cut trees down. He couldn't keep his view. So he got people round up. It's because he was sort of a master at that. George Washington said, a violation of my land is a violation of my being. That is at our core. Who is surreal Ailes showed up with his attorney. He was locked and loaded and you know ready to go out there and do battle. And after we had the debate, Ailes walks up to me let me know he owned the newspaper let me know he owns the courier across the county and essentially said look if I'm not happy you're not going to be happy. It wasn't a big threat. It was like, yeah, okay, fine. You want a newspaper, great. In hindsight, I was a little naive. When Roger took over the paper, definitely became a political tool. They put fourth candidates for a village office, town office who had no background in anything to do with local government. They got a guy to run against me who was just, you know, regular working guy like me and they put a lot of money into billboards and prepping him for debates and Roger, he told me he had never lost any election campaign he'd gotten involved with. And he was going to see me at office. And we came here with a mission to change this town from blue to red. Listen to this one. Roger Ailes needs enemies like a tank like a tank needs fuel. How come? Why the pugnacity? Well, I would argue with that. I don't need enemies. I have plenty. But if somebody gets over the line or challenges in some incorrect way I will respond. Roger saw himself as a general and nothing brought more joy to Roger than a battle. He was like John Wayne leading the Green Berets through Vietnam and if there was no battle, he would create the battle. Which is what he did with Fox News. Dividing us between the Conservatives and the Liberals. Roger thought that we were in a war against our way of life, against evil, and he was very moved by stories of patriotism and stories of heroes. How is he? Pretty bad, sir but still alive. He had hemophilia and he said, I couldn't serve in the military and that's a big regret of mine, but I consider this my payment to the country and I consider this my battle station and I'm not leaving my battle station. I'm afraid for our country and for our children's futures. It's just really a scary time in history. This is about the systematic dismantling of this country. People are fired up. They're upset with the government. If I got that right. Americans love their families. They love their flag. They think schools have gone off the edge and killed American history. I built Fox understanding the pressures, worries, and aspirations of average Americans. I love these people. This is Vivian in Cincinnati and Roger Ailes, we love you here. Keep up the good work. I want to thank Fox News for bringing polite issues that don't get covered by the other network. Mister Ailes, I'm missing Fox and Friends to see you this morning. Don't do that. We need all the viewers we we can get on Fox. Turn me off immediately and go to Fox & Friends. Lots of people are smarter than Roger Ailes. Lots and lots. But nobody was as canny as Roger. He could read a person very fast. He could read a room very fast and boy, did he get the temperature of the country when nobody else did. That's nice. You see? Oh, wow. It's great. His numbers are fantastic. Roger absolutely understood from all the time in politics that frightening people, pouring gasoline on that fire that gets people glued to their television. That was the genius of Roger. Knowing how to speak the language of America. More blood, more red meat. I gotta get you outraged so you watch more. - Caution. - Listen up America. It is happening, America. I am telling you America as we know it, freedom of speech as we know it is over. The left has been preparing and indoctrinating. They're going to take away your constitutional rights. They sneer at you. They have contempt for you. Who's going to stop this madness? You. Are you paying attention now? When you're watching Fox News, you think these people are just kind of peddling these theories because they want more viewers and they're catering to their base, but based on my conversation with Roger Ailes he truly believed in it. Barack Obama has deep emotional ties to Islam He said to me Barack Obama he's really not a Christian he's a Muslim his father is Muslim. He could deny it all he wants but he has an agenda. What do you think that was? To ruin America, to bring it down. He felt like the president at the time was a threat and it was almost like his duty as the head of Fox News to get the truth out. Barack Obama's father who abandoned his family was a Muslim, who eventually turned atheist. Barack Obama has dozens of unelected and unaccountable czars working to execute his radical plans. Let's give his new Green Job czar. The guy is, again, black liberation theology, a black nationalist. This is part of the movement that is trying to get Islam specifically Sharia Law infused into the legal court system. This president I think has exposed himself as a guy over and over and over again who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture. I don't know what it is. Roger Ailes paved the way for conspiracy theories to go mainstream. The idea that Barack Obama is not American, Pizzagate, whatever it is, there's no shame now in promoting this stuff and in fact, the benefit is you get airtime and if you get airtime, you become more famous. Donald Trump is back here with us. - Great to have you all here. - You are a man of action. Trump is such a foxy character that if he hadn't been real then Roger Ailes would have created him in a lab. He can say what he wants, but the fact is that this guy has not revealed his birth certificate. He just signs executive orders all over the place then that he will be sued on that. He'll be out on a golf course in about 3 years when it comes up. Everything he touches turns to trouble and I was going to use the worst word but I refuse to use that word. You know, Trump had a personal relationship with a lot of the people of the network. He was on every Fox show. He was on O'Reilly. He was on Hannity. He was on Fox and Friends. He was everywhere. Donald Trump, welcome back. It's it's Monday. It's time for you. Good morning. So, Trump was a familiar voice to the Fox News audience, which I think is what made him so palatable during the Republican primary. That was Roger's power and influence. Roger Ailes is one of the most consequential figures in our cultural history. And at a time when the news business as a whole was like dying and failing, he created one of the most profitable news ventures ever. He figured out that there was this white leaning market that hadn't been cornered. It aligned with his own worldview and in short order, Fox News became the number one cable network. Our cable news competition has been destroyed. Ratings for liberal TV news are dismal. Fox News Channel remained the top cable news channel... And then all of his assumptions have been proven right. Ailes has signed a new multi-year contract with the company. I mean he was winning. He was winning. I think when you look at Roger Ailes in this community, he tried to take it over but never really became part of it. And he may have been a genius on the national scene, but I think he really did not get what the local community was. I moved up to that quiet village but I had no idea there was any intrigue up there. I thought this was a normal, nice community. All of a sudden, we find out, holy shit, reminds me of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam. Working at the newspaper with Roger and Beth, it was always thinking the worst of people, always thinking that someone was out to get them. They relished rousing and dividing and I just decided I just can't take it anymore. Gotta get out. A great number of people in their staff left. It was sizable. It was you know at least 50% and we all knew that they would perceive it as an attack. About three days after I left there I began hearing from people whom I had sent Facebook messages to, private Facebook messages, from my own account that that they knew that Roger Ailes had looked at them and in one instance the person received a phone call from Roger Ailes and he picked up and he said and he got this is Roger Ailes I hear that you've been making threats about me and he quoted whatever innocuous throw away line. He quoted verbatim from my personal accounts. All password projected signed into by me and it was absolutely terrifying. This feeling that there are really powerful people who live five minutes from my door who were out to destroy me and my little life. But I was just the copy editor. Like, why does he care? You know, during the election, it got so ugly. I remember at one point he said, "I'll park a goddamn Fox News truck at the end of your driveway and have them follow you as long as I want. And that's not the kind of thing that you're expecting in small town politics. You know, they put our house on the front page of the Putnam County News and you know, I was getting letters about abortion and one guy told me point blank one time if I ever see you across the street, I'll run you over and it was like, man, this is nuts. But in the end, the election wasn't close, not within 50%. We're here at McCoy Gallery's house celebrating the Democratic sweep. The oppositions here. We've all shook hands and made it up. So, we're looking forward to working for the town and getting things back to normal. After a winning the election we spent many many hours together and he would call me on a lot of Fridays come on down, I want to talk to you, on Friday afternoon. It would be about local issues and then it would just morph into him telling me about himself. Trying to impress me. He would always tell me how much money he made, "just made a billion dollars last year for Fox" and it was sad in a way I'm thinking here's a guy with all the money in the world could be anywhere, be doing anything and we're in the offices of Putnam County News having a chat. I was wondered, does this guy have actual friends? Don't you have somewhere you'd rather be? He would come right out and say why do people hate me so much here? People who believe they are victims will become victims. People who believe that they can win eventually will win. Keep your eyes on other people. Watch what's going on. Are they agreeing with you or disagreeing? I was told my first week on the job Roger has this place bugged. He's got the newsroom bugged, he's got the elevators bugged he's got all the talent offices bugged. Don't talk shit about Roger. Don't talk about how much you love Hillary Clinton, because we'll fire you if they hear you talking like that. At one point, he called me into his office and he said, you know, lot of people doing their homework on you. I said, I know. And he said, "so you have to be careful" and he said, "I know" And he said "look, there's a lot of stuff out there". He reaches down and he pulls up a stack of file folders about this tall, literally. Sits right in front of him and he puts his hand on there and he sits there and he looks at me for a while and he said "it's always a shame when a man has a wife as wonderful as yours". I was like "oh, my gosh" and I leaned up out of my chair towards his desk and I said "yes" and he said "it's always a shame when a man does something to hurt that woman" and I said "it is" "and that's why I'm happy to say nothing like that has happened" and he stared at me for about 30 seconds, he put the files down and he said "but I just want you to be careful." He was fishing for something. He was bluffing. I think there was nothing in those files. That was Roger's way of having control of people. First thing I tell people at Fox is, if you're not happy here and you're not having fun here, you need to get out of here. Cuz we don't want to be around downers. Negative people make positive people physically ill. All progress depends on positive people. Get away from the other ones. They're going to drag you down. I was offered on three occasions to go and work at Fox. And I turned them all down. I think Roger was a different person then. And it wasn't a place that I wanted to work. And it's sad to me that he went on to do what he did. I think he probably would have been happier if America's Talking continued. When I went up to visit him at Fox, he seemed happy to see me. I mean, he was married, he had a son. He talked a lot about his son, Zach, when I saw him, but I remember thinking it was a little bit odd because he had the bulletproof glass, the cameras that were feeding into his office. It was a steal or some kind of reinforced door, and he said that he had to protect himself against the Libyans or something. Mister Ailes wasn't favorable towards people of Middle Eastern descent. He kind of had these preconceived ideas of them. And there was one incident, a horrible incident that a coworker of mine, Mushfiq, he had to bring something to the second floor and wound up in mister Ailes' area and all hell broke loose. Next thing you know, there was a wall built so he had to go through a door to get into his area. Mushfiq was upset. He was in tears. They revoked his access, not to mister Ailes' area, but to the second floor entirely. Roger Ailes was a profoundly paranoid person. He carried a gun at all times. He was convinced that Al-Qaeda was trying to kill him, that gay terrorists would come attack him. Roger Ailes thought that like Osama Bin Laden was sitting in his cave and he had like the list of people. And it was like George W. Bush and then Roger Ailes. He thought that he was a world historical figure worthy of an assassination attempt. At the White House Christmas Party I was directly behind Roger in line to have our photos taken with the president, so I peeked around the curtain and I watched as Roger Ailes approached and Barack Obama turned around and held his arms out and saw Roger for the first time and said Roger Ailes, the most powerful man in media. Step right up. And Roger went up and shook his hand and they stood and smiled for the camera and took the shot. I didn't know if they were going to insult each other or like come to blows because it had been so tense for so long and so when we got back the next day I was back at Fox and I ran into one of the senior vice presidents who said "oh did you have fun at the Christmas party?" I said "oh my gosh I had a great time it was fascinating" because I was right behind Roger for the the photo taking and he said "oh and then you heard the the big moment?" and I said "yes I did" and he said "wasn't it crazy to hear President Obama say Roger Ailes the most powerful man in the world?" and I said "that's not what he said" and he said "yes, it is". I said "he said Roger Ailes the most powerful man in media". But there was no point in me going to like burst Roger's bubble or call bullshit on it with him, you know, one on one, because I saw that that was already the new narrative. Roger was definitely invested in creating a myth about who he was and what he had come from and it was a myth about overcoming adversity. It was a myth about success. It was a myth about power. For example, the story of Roger jumping to his father and then being allowed to fall flat on the ground is such a well-known literary trope. The story of how a father teaches his son the hard lessons of life it's been used in literature many many times and the story happens in the bedroom he shares with his brother. His brother denies that that story is true but I think it's Roger's effort to create a kind of "trust no one-victim" narrative that really fueled him and Roger really knew how to manipulate that. It's hard when you actually believe in something and you you don't want to do harm but somehow you just keep doing harm. Ladies and gentlemen. Glenn Beck. Hello, America! I remember when I was in Washington DC, was after the big thing on the mall and I remember praying and hearing "you're standing in the wrong place." We are truly humbled. How am I now in this position where I'm the most polarizing divisive figure in the country? And it was the beginning of give it all up. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. So, I went into Roger's office and I said "I'm leaving" and he said "no, you're not, nobody leaves" and I said "yeah, you know what?" Before you say anything, can I just say something because I know how this is going to end here, so just let me say this to you no matter what thank you I said thank you for giving the conservatives a chance to have a voice and he looked at me and his eyes welled up and that meant something to him that somebody actually sought that way. I said to Roger, so what are you, what's next for you? I said, why are you still here? And he said I still have a president to pick. I still have a president to pick. We're in a storm. Our mast is broken and our compass is off and there's a big damn hole in the boat. We've allowed ourselves to be manipulated by others. Is everything fair game today? Is everything personal? A sexual harassment scandal is rocking the world of cable news. Gretchen Carlson who until recently was an anchor for Fox News is suing the channel's powerful CEO Roger Ailes. She accuses him of firing her for refusing his sexual advances. Gretchen Carlson was a former Miss America. She's crying. That's obligatory. She was a violin prodigy and had used those talents to get her Miss America crown. But she also had a kind of hard edge and she was sophisticated even though when she was on air on Fox & Friends. She sort played dumb. We're not supposed to wear the same color and I just... It's been one of those mornings, okay? No kidding. But she certainly went into this prepared. She had been recording conversations with Roger long before her contract wasn't renewed. She accused him of angling her in his office and asking her to turn around so he could view her posterior claiming Ailes has told her I think you and I have had a sexual relationship adding that sometimes problems are easier to solve that way. There is a way to operate in a crisis and there are a group of professionals who know how to do that. When Roger is being accused of sexual harassment and needs to know he should hire and who he should go to for advice. Who does he call but Donald Trump? We operate in a very small space called crisis communications but with clients that find themselves, we always say in difficult or delicate situations. So, we get a lot of our work through attorneys. The day after Gretchen's lawsuit was filed, I was on my way home from the gym and it was about 7:30 in the morning and the phone rang and it was an attorney that is a well-known litigator. He said, I work with Donald Trump a great deal. Donald Trump is looking to find someone who could help his friend, Roger Ailes. And at that point, we did not know much about Roger's history with women and we walked in with the belief that this was a legal case and that they were going to be fighting it on the legal merits. We pulled in and we were greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Beth Ailes' sister and she took us into the living room, which was very heavy chins floral sofas and seated against the windows in this huge armchair was Roger himself larger than life hooked up to an intravenous bag attached to one of those long, those high metal stands and Beth said Roger is getting his vitamins. There was this whirlwind going on around him and about him. It was just this frenetic kind of energy, war room like, of phones ringing, people walking in and out. I just heard from Alan Dershowitz Oh, that's so and so is weighing in. I need to get on the phone. Rudy Giuliani could just called me. Everybody was a guardian at the gate to protect Roger and he really responded, I think, very well to that. Which is one of the reasons why it offended him that Gretchen Carlson had sued him. This no good sort of talentless reporter. He said that really the lawsuit wasn't about the money. It was about getting attention. And that she was desperate to be on television and without being on television she had no reason to live. And I said you know in the end all these cases usually settle because it's not worth the negative publicity and it's not worth the impact and when I said that, Beth Ailes jumped out of her chair furious and she said, with this look in her eyes, we will never ever settle this case and she looked at us and she said, you need to understand something. Roger is more important than America. I looked at Warren and I looked at his pad because Warren was taking notes and Warren said, I'm writing it down. Roger is more important than America. Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes is responding to a lawsuit filed by lawyers for Gretchen Carlson calling her accusations or allegations false and defensive. They said all statements will be run through Irena Briganti, the head of public relations for Fox who he told us was a stone killer and she was intensely in focused on getting as many of the highest profile and frankly best looking women on Fox that indeed he was not a harasser and Irena was really to say proud that in one day she'd been able to enlist 22 people - just to say... - We're up to 22. Right, we're up to 22, Roger. Several female Fox anchors are coming to his defense, including Maria Bartiromo, who says I've known him to be nothing but a professional. It's very sad because he's a very good person and I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he's helped them. Beth called Kimberly Guilfoyle who was one of the anchors at something like 6:30 in the morning, the day after the suit was filed. The idea was to get Kimberly to read a statement of support on air while a group of Fox News women walked in behind her and formed a sort of semi circle behind her as a show of support for him. They had a whole strategy and the more we push back, Irena would say things like, stand down. So, here's the deal. If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. If you don't like what's happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave but don't run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it. Factor tip of the day, loyalty is good. Fox is Ailes' fiefdom but even he has a boss, three bosses actually, Rupert Murdoch and his two sons and the Murdochs are now involved. Rupert had always protected Roger but this time it was different because Rupert's sons James and Lachlan Murdoch, who had never liked Roger. Roger never liked them. Had decided to hire an outside law firm to investigate the claims against Roger. He was so dismissive. He really believed that as annoying as these two kids were, you know, he could flick them off and that's really why he had to defend this lawsuit so that they didn't use this as the weapon that they were looking for. He told us that most of the talent on Fox had in their contract that they had the right to walk. If anything were to happen to him and he were to have to leave and so he was really intent on showing that almost every notable name on Fox was going to leave with him. Who with any kind of fiduciary responsibility allows that to happen? That if the the CEO leaves, everyone else can leave, all the key players can leave and destroy the network. Wow, that's wow. I think that there was a part of Roger that wanted to be remembered as the guy who built Fox and as soon as he left, the whole thing fell apart. Bill O'Reilly's going to leave if I leave. Greta Van Susteren gonna leave if I leave. Janine, I mean, he went through the whole list. - But when are we going to get Megan? - Where do we, right. What's with Megan? And I read it said, we'll have to discuss that offline. Right. And Beth was livid. Livid that the answer wasn't an immediate yes. Now another Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has entered the controversy. Kelly told investigators Ailes harassed her when she was a young correspondent in Washington. It was explicit quid pro quo sexual harassment which was you know basically you sleep with me and I'll give you a promotion. But I had to shove him off of me and he came back and I shoved him again and he came back a third time. And then when I shoved him off the third time he asked me when my contract was up. Congratulations, Roger. You finally achieved your ultimate fantasy. Getting fucked by two gorgeous employees at the same time. Gretchen had started a #StandWithGretchen and more accusations have kept coming out. Half a dozen additional women claiming the Fox News Chairman sexually harassed them years ago. And the dam broke. People who had been afraid of him for decades finally felt a little bit more emboldened to actually talk about him. When Gretchen came forward, I said, I have to support this woman. I have to let her know that this has happened for 50 years with this man and I'm a little nobody but it happened to me and I want you to know that. I was just beginning to modeling, and I got a call from the Mike Douglas Show that we wanted me to come down and audition and then I had a call from Roger Ailes himself telling me that he wanted me to wear a garter belt and stockings and high heels and I thought it was a little odd but I was new in this career so I put them on and went to the audition. And when I got there, he took me in his office, closed the door, and he said, I want you to show me your legs and I said, well, why would you want me to do And he said, no, no, no. If your legs look good in the that stockings and garter belt, I know you have great legs. Then he asked me to sit on the sofa, pull my skirt up, stand in different poses, pull my skirt up while he was taking polaroids off me. And then he said that he would put me on the show but I had to go to bed with him and I just said kind of off hand "yeah, right, you and who else?" and he just said "just me and a few of my preferred friends." He was treating me like I was a whore. That's how I felt. And at that point I just said no. No. I can't do that. And he said "no, pretty girls like you are a dime a dozen." And that's when I ended the interview and left. And never enter my head to tell anybody until I heard about Gretchen. My son said to me, mom, Be brave. Thank you for standing up for all the women that go through this. That just really touched me that that he was proud that I was doing it. I think the twist of the night for Rogers when he realizes that Rupert isn't behind him. And he is going to have to go but there's still muscle memory for Roger so he's still showing up for work. So, he's on his way to the office and his driver gets a call from the head of security, says, please drive him around the block a few times. So there's this absurd scene where his driver drives him around and then gets word that he's been locked out of the building. It's such an ignominious end to not even be able to come in and collect your things from the place that you've created. They took him out like a drone strike. They just wanted to remove him from the equation. Once there was that cascade of allegations and once Rupert Murdoch obviously made the decision to fire him, that was it. You didn't see him anymore. They were gone. They were done. I don't think he wanted to show his face around town which is he must have cared about his reputation obviously and it was, that sort of thing is not good for your reputation. I will admit to as woman after woman came forward although I felt sorry for the women at the same time I was like he's done. It finally happened he's done. And I was happy that it happened while he was alive. Fox settled with Carlson agreeing to pay her a staggering 20 million... Three weeks later Gretchen got her settlement and 14 more women came forward and said what about me I've got a story that's not very different and it wasn't just confined to Roger Ailes. A "sex-fueled-Playboy-mansion like cult", that's how host to describe the Fox News Channel. We were abused. Our careers were were destroyed and our lives were destroyed. The case gets uglier and uglier by the day. Six more women now claim Ailes sexually harassed them. In shocking accounts reported by New York magazine, half a dozen additional women claiming... I didn't realize the extent to which Roger really was a predator. He would have me get down on my knees and tell me You know what you are, Laura. You're my whore. You're my sex glade. On Fox News, Megyn Kelly has a new book coming out. - Have you read it? - No. - Haven't I read it? No. - You're in it. I'm not that interested in this, okay? I'm not interested in making my network look bad at all that doesn't interest me one bit. Nobody could have predicted how fast the house of cards fell. Fire, Bill, Riley. Bill O'Reilly settled a sexual harassment claim to the tune of $32 million. $32 million, which is around the same amount OJ Simpson had to pay the Goldman family in a civil lawsuit for murdering two people. Little do we know they would have this cascading effect and that in the space of one year Roger would be ousted, that Bill O'Reilly would be ousted. This was a hit job. A political financial hit shot to bring down Fox News and me. So does that mean things have changed at Fox? I don't know. I don't know. How harmful has the whole raft of allegations about sexual harassment at Fox News been for the business? It's all nonsense. There was a problem with our chief executive. Sort of over the year but isolated incidents. Soon as we investigated, he was out of the place in hours. Well, 3 or 4 days. And there's been nothing else since then I mean there are really bad cases that people should be moved aside. And there are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting, you know? I think Rupert Murdoch is a disgusting human being. He allowed so many abuses to take place and when Rupert went on television and said that what was going on at Fox News was flirting, nonsense, only Roger Ailes. I knew that I had to respond. Hundreds of millions of dollars has gone to settling cases with women over and over and over again and we've been told that we have to shut up. We just wanted to work. That's all we've ever wanted to do was work. That is not nonsense. This is people's lives. There have been plenty of settlements that none of us know about. And women who've disappeared from there because they're afraid to say anything publicly. That's how big this was. Since 2004, sexual harassment at 21st Century Fox has led to payouts of more than $163 million. Settlements require silence. The actual number of cases, and full money paid, is unknown. As more and more stories have come forth since Roger Ailes, you begin to realize that people like Roger Ailes can't get away with all this stuff if there aren't a circle of people around them, that make them look better than they are, that protect them legally, that schedule those meetings, that get rid of people that are problems, and that's not us and that's why this is the first time, publicly, we've really spoken about it at all. We really don't talk about clients and our clients expect us not to. But in this case not only did we not have a contract, not only did we not have an NDA not only did we not have any legal reasons why we couldn't. - Or get paid. - or get paid. But it's wrong, it's so wrong and I can't be part of that and not only am I not going to be part of that I'm going to expose it so that these men one day can get some of what they really deserve which is that there's justice for their victims Roger died within a year of leaving Fox News. Because Fox News was such a big part of Roger Ailes that when it all fell apart, there was nothing left for Roger. That's who he was. He was chairman of Fox. Our former CEO and chairman, husband to Beth, father of Zach, fell at his home in Florida and did not survive. Roger Ailes was a patriot. He was the biggest personality and the most influential and powerful man I ever personally encountered. I loved him. Roger gave every single one of us on this couch an opportunity. He put food on our table and you know, he went out in such a sad way but who doesn't have sins? He will be missed on this channel. He will be missed. There's no denying. He was a powerful, influential person who changed the country. Roger knew what fear could do. Roger knew what paranoia could do to the audience. They kept coming back. The big disappointment is that he used his talent and his media savvy to build something that drove a wedge. To me that's pretty devastating. I thought that things would be more different after he was gone but he casts such a long shadow that his vision can actually go on without him. There is a report out there guys that the President of the United States watches us at 7 AM Eastern Time. So let's take a look at the White House right now. If if the President of the United States is actually watching, blink the lights on and off. Okay. Oh my goodness.
