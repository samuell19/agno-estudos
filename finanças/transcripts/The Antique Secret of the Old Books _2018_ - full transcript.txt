Grandma passed away. It's ready, here, pork chop rice. Grandma made for you. I'm digging in. I don't know why grandma puts Umeboshi in pork chop rice bowl. So sour. Daisuke's appetite is still very good. I can't eat my grandmother's pork chop rice bowl anymore. Always gentle grandma left me. "And Then" What are you doing? Daisuke Didn't I tell you that you should never touch the bookshelf? For me, this is more important than anything. I was so scared. I haven't seen novels full of text ever since. It is my fault. I didn't really want to hit you. How many years ago already? I can't read books any more. Daisuke's life should be different from now. It won't change that much. I always thought grandma spent all her life in an ordinary cafeteria with nothing. Until i see that book again Store Closure Notice Our shop decided to close since the owner, Goura, passed away. Although we are a small cafeteria, Thank you for your 80 years of love to this day. Daisuke. Are you organizing things? Yes "And Then" "Afterwards" Summer… what? ... summer… Natsume Soseki? Mom Look at this...the signature of Natsume Soseki. Really? It must be true. That's why I was hit by this book when she touched it. If it's fake, how could she slap two-year-old cute grandson. Who is Tanaka Yoshio? I don't know who. Tanaka Yoshio Biblia Ancient Book Shop Grandma? Grandma It's about an old book and the stories of the people involved. Memory of Antique Books Hello. Excuse me. ........ 500,000? Sorry Ah not that I want to ask you to read some books I'm Shinokawa Shioriko from Biblia Ancient Book Shop. My name is Goura Daisuke. Can you show me your book? Please. Excuse me This is the book. I think it was bought by my deceased grandma. Ah Natsume Soseki Iwanami Bookstore Edition Eh? Iwanami Bookstore is the first bookstore in Japan to publish the Complete Works of Natsume Soseki. Even this book cover is well-preserved. This is the first complete collection of Soseki's works. The notes were all rewritten by Soseki's disciple, Komiya Toyotaka. The book called "The Complete Works of Soseki" adds up to more than 30 kinds. Amazing Yeah, Natsume Soseki said to be the most popular writer in Japan. No, it's not about Soseki, it's about you. No By the way, there is a signature on one of these books. "And Then" Looks like real.. but Let me see. "I am a Cat" "Sanshiro" "I am a Cat" "The Three-Cornered World" "Sanshiro" "I am a Cat" "Sanshiro" "The Three-Cornered World" "The Three-Cornered World" "The Poppy" "The Three-Cornered World" "The Poppy" "Light and Darkness" "The Poppy" "To the Spring Equinox and Beyond" "Light and Darkness" "The Poppy" "Light and Darkness" "To the Spring Equinox and Beyond" "Botchan" "Light and Darkness" "To the Spring Equinox and Beyond" "To the Spring Equinox and Beyond" "Botchan" "Grass on the Wayside" "To the Spring Equinox and Beyond" "Botchan" "Botchan" "Grass on the Wayside" "Grass on the Wayside" Did your name come from grandma? Eh? Daisuke from Goura Daisuke. I am not sure. Haven't you read this book since then? Yes You don't you read a lot? I can't read books. Is it because grandma got angry at you? How do you know? Grandma cherishes this set of books very much. But you touched it, when you didn't know Kanji at the age of four or five. Because you only understand the Hiragana title, you took it in your hand. -Have you been hit hard?-2 hits. Fortunately, it only passed after 2 hits. If you know this secret.... Sorry I used to be like this, people often tell me. As soon as I get to talk about books, I will keep talking. What secret did you say? I can't say that. It is your grandma's privacy. Sorry That Natsume Soseki's signature is fake. Fake, that's who wrote and sold it. But this is a grandma's book. Young grandma. Spend time alone with there. Did your name come from grandma? Daisuke from Goura Daisuke. Can I ask you why I am called Daisuke? Grandma insisted on this name. Really? It seems to be a character in a novel she likes. "And Then" As hurried footsteps clattered past the gate, a pair of large clogs hung suspended from the sky. Since being slapped by my grandma. I can't read fiction novels. When I open a book, I will feel palpitations and sweat. As a result, I only know the name of the hero is Daisuke. I still can't understand. If that signature is fake,... Why was I beaten 2 times? What is grandma's secret? I, who has left a psychological trauma, should know. Can you keep this secret? I understood. Natsume Soseki's signature was written by your grandma. Eh? Tanaka is definitely a book-lover. That the eighth edition "And Then" of your grandma,... I'm afraid it was 53 years ago. How did you know? There's a price tag inside "And Then" book. The price tag written by a brush is only used in the year when the store opened. 1964, the year the Tokyo Olympics were held. So it is like that. Here is the book seal. This is the book seal. It is the seal affixed by the holder to prove his own book. But only the eighth volume is not covered. Maybe I have the eighth volume since I bought the full set. After removing the duplicate eighth volume, it was placed on the bookshelf. How did you know? If there is only the eighth volume on the bookshelf, if you don't want to be seen, it's better to hide it. Maybe she thought it would be safer to put it with other books. Since she doesn't want to let her family see it. Since this is a book given to her by an important person. This one This is the format for signing a signature. The format is that the author not only wrote his own name but also wrote the name of the giver. The giver is usually written in the middle, and the author's name is written on the left. But this is the opposite. I am afraid that it was only the signature of Tanaka Yoshio. In a closer look, the handwriting is also different. Even if it's written by the same person, the position is not very balanced. Why did Tanaka sign here? It's no surprise to sign your name on the gift. He forged Soseki's signature for the sake of being seen. To hide to such an extent, it must be a romance that cannot be known by others. Romance that is not known to others. When did your grandma get married? The school has not accepted you. Why are you talking to yourself? Does anyone get the same results? This is my privacy. Since you are old already, don't just talk about privacy. If you are upset, go to find a job. What are you doing? It's nothing. Hey. Do you know when the grandmother got married? 1960? 1964, the year the Tokyo Olympics were held. This is the book given by an important person. Mom, what year were you born? The following year after the Tokyo Olympics. When he gave the book to grandma, she was married. Why are you asking this? It's nothing. Mom Have you seen Natsume Soseki's "And Then"? No but I watched the movie. Starring Matsuda Yusaku. The plot is like the hero cheating with someone else's wife. Eh? Romance that is not known to others. Yoshio Kinoko, I believe you. Romance that is not known to others. Could it be my real grandfather? Someone else. Anyone can know grandma's secret,... by peeping from this little book. That person I am no longer afraid to stand in that huge darkness. Everyone will definitely find true happiness. No matter where you go, let's move forward together. Yeah, we can go together. Campanella can still be seen far from the window. Then pointed to the beautiful field outside the window and called.. That's all today. Read more... Then, I will continue tomorrow. Got it. Goodbye Goodbye Bye, be careful on the way. Goodbye I want to thank you for that time. I am glad I showed you those books. I like the books more than just a story hidden in it.

Please help out the signboard. What to do next? Please turn on the light. We opened earlier than the bookstores selling new books. Got it. If you fill the book with no gaps, you can see it if someone steals it. But if the rows are too tight, the books will be damaged. Just keep it that size. Keep it this size. Please be careful here. If we remove this wedge, the entire bookshelf will collapse. Will it collapse? This is really dangerous. Wedges must not touch. Danger. Now. Thank you so much. Thank you. Shioriko. Do you remember? My condition "And Then" As hurried footsteps clattered past the gate, a pair of large clogs hung suspended from the sky. When the footsteps grew distant, the clogs slipped quietly away and vanished. And then, Daisuke awoke. Turning to the head of his bed, he noticed a single camellia blossom that had fallen to the floor. He was certain he had heard it drop during the night the sound had resounded in his ears like a rubber ball bounced off from the ceiling. Although he thought this might be explained by the silence of the night... Natsume Soseki's "And Then" is the story of a man who had a love affair with someone else's wife. He gazed intently at her face that his eyes which seem to be moistened might jumped out. That's all today. Yoshio When are you going to be a nomad? You also don't look for work.

When she went shopping, she bought a book "History and Spices of India". I said you should buy meat and vegetables and come back. But ... but Goura How much do you understand about curry? Understand? Speaking of how much I understand. I didn't understand how deep it is. Can you make curry like this? I can do a simple curry. -Can you do it? I can do it. Nee-chan knows nothing but books.
