[CHEONG KEE BUTCHER] LAM SAI-WING Thank you. Porky Wing's coming. Morning. Morning. Who was the poor wretch leaving banana peel around? Wan Chu-Cheong, good morning! What are you doing?! Uh... Those two pigs... Oh! You wanna buy pigs, huh? Business from a fellow butcher, I'll give it to you for cheap! Whaddaya mean, "buy"?! Those two pigs were raised by me! Yours?! Then what kinda distinguishing marks do they have? Well, there's no distinguishing marks... But all pigs look the same! Oh... if pigs all look the same, we're pigs too, so greet me properly. Wan Chu-Cheong! Hmm? Wan. Chu. Cheong? Call me Daddy! Why? Look at this. I've got a beard. You said it yourself that all pigs look the same. Since I've got a beard... Guess that makes me your dad then. Call me Daddy, and I'll give you two pigs! Screw your dad! I'll just lose the pigs! Hmph! I knew I got conned, but didn't even say anything. I'm just screwing myself over, then. Call him Dad and I get to take two pigs. I can't lose! Uh... Wan Chu-Cheong, I call you Dad, and I can take two pigs? That's right. In that case, listen up. Dad. Good boy. Dad. Dad. H-h-hey! Hey! Hey! H-h-hey! Hey! Hey! H-h-hey! You keep taking them, and I'll have to call you Dad! Hold it! Don't you dare call me that! As if I'd have a prodigal son like you! It's all your fault, idiot! That damn Porky Wing! Out of the way. Out of the way. Horse advances. I'll do this, then. Check! Elephant cancels. Cannon to centre. Check. I send my advisor. Attack the elephant. Check. Out of moves. I'm not the one out of moves. You're the one out of a chariot, more like. H-h-h-h-hey! Do you know how to play chess?! What?! "Attack chariot in the open, assassinate horse, take cannon in secret." You took a chariot and didn't even call it! Since when did you have to call when taking a chariot? Once you raise your hand, there's no going back! Give my chariot back! Move again! Move again! Give my chariot back! So what if I don't give it back? You're such a cheat, I'm done playing! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! H-how can you just steal it?! Hey! - I'd be stupid to put up with you! - Hey, you thief! Hey! Thief! Give it back to me! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! You've got some gall, stealing in broad daylight?! H-h-hey! Hey! Hey! Listen to me, he stole my... Oh! I know! He stole something from you, right?? Leave it to me! Did you steal something? I didn't! I didn't... Still not admitting to it?! Are you admitting to it? I admit it... I stole something... So, a voluntary confession, huh? A voluntary confession you beat out of me... H-h-h-h-hey! Hey, you've got it wrong. - He did steal from me... H-hey! - Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. That thing you stole from him, take it out. Come on! I'm giving it back to him... Is it all there? W-What...? It's only a chariot? It was only a chariot...! How are you feeling, uncle? I'm in pain all over! Oh dear, poor man. How did you get beaten up so badly? It was you! Don't worry! Don't worry! I'm here, I'll take you to get some medicine. Let's go. C-come on... Come on... [FIVE DRAGON HALL] Gold! Wood! Water! Fire! Earth! Good kung fu, Big Brother! Big Brother, you've taken this Five Element Cinnabar Palm with its Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth forms to a truly mystical height, ever transforming and unpredictable. This palm technique... l have practiced it for 30-odd years. In the world of martial arts, I have claimed the number two spot. Nobody dares claim the number one. Dad. Tai-Hoi, aren't you running a business in Fukien? Hmph! Always chasing women and wine! Wasting all your money away! Dad, that's not it at all. It's just hard to run a business nowadays. My prodigal son! Truly like concrete that cannot hold up a wall. Godfather, your tea. What are you staring at?! She is your godsister Ian-Sam. Ian-Sam, go back inside. Dad, I'm going back to my room to change. Master Ko! What happened that you got beaten up like this? It was that disciple of Wong Fei-Hung, Lam Sai-Wing. He was throwing his weight around, and he beat me up for no reason. How dare he! Lam Sai-Wing was this vicious?! I even told him I was with Five Dragon Hall. He said he didn't care if it was a town hall, a dance hall, or a concert hall! Then he threw in some extra punches too! And that's not the end of it! Wong Fei-Hung called you a phony! Said you should change the name of Five Dragon Hall to Five Snake Hall. And make the most of the autumn wind, change career to sell snake soup instead. Hmph! Wong Fei-Hung, let us see how good you really are! [PO CHI LAM] Master, take a seat. Good. Good. Here, Master. Wong Fei-Hung! Why, Master Ko, what a pleasant surprise. Hmph! The reputation of your Po Chi Lam is so mighty, how would I dare not come and pay my respects? So, bring the tea. A-ah... of c-course... M-m-master. Master Ko, please take a seat. Ah! The chair has been eaten through by insects. Please excuse the mess. What refined pursuits. Master Wong, you must have a penchant for the study of calligraphy. You flatter me. A single balding brush can unite a family, govern a nation, bring peace under heaven. I too studied calligraphy for a few years. Master Wong, please evaluate my semi-cursive script. "Brush descends, startling the wind and the rain." "The finished poem, rouses ghosts and gods to weep." Brother Ko, your brushwork is far too skewed! An upright heart, leads to an upright brush! You should practice regular script and master the basics first! One must have an upright heart, upright posture, upright brush, upright words, and upright lines. [BENEVOLENCE] Only with those can fine words be written. Wild cursive! Kill! [KILL] "Brush slithers as dragon or snake." "A painting of iron, its details of silver." Come on. Harder! Your wild cursive script lacks strength in your wrist! The composition is a mess! [PERSON] My fingers as a brush. Collapsed wrist, sunken elbow. Master Wong, there are marks on the paper. Have meaning before putting brush to paper. Then will brush strokes crisscross the page. [NONE] No marks at all. If you manage to finish writing, I will carry your shoes! [ENEMY] [WONG FEI-HUNG] [THE BENEVOLENT HAVE NO ENEMIES - WONG FEI-HUNG] Master Ko, these words ring true. Master, are you really going to carry his shoes? Wong, do you know to write the word "death"? Do you know how to write the word "submit"? Submit?! Master, he's submitting! Busybody! Wong Fei-Hung, you are really something! You spoil your disciples, letting them run amok and stir up trouble outside. They beat up one of my people. They do not show me, an old master, the proper respect. You three bad eggs! Which one of you was out causing trouble?! Lam Sai-Wing! Master Ko... My most sincere apologies. Wing beat up one of your people. I will definitely punish him! Today I give you my word that something like this will never happen again. I humbly ask for your forgiveness. Fine! Wong Fei-Hung, I will take you at your word this one time! If your disciples become the object of my scorn again, I will tear down your Po Chi Lam sign. Hmph! Porky Wing! Why is it your fault every time something bad happens?! Huh?! Why does this happen?! Master... Do not "Master" me! You... you've got it all wrong... Still talking back?! I forbid you from talking today! Wing, be careful with those! If you break 'em, you'll be in deep trouble! I'm going shopping, you want anything? Got nothing to say? Guess that means you're good. 'Brother'? 'Brother'? Hah... Stupid blind codger, how the hell do you know I'm a 'brother'? Why couldn't I be a woman? From all my sniffing experience, nothing about your stench is like a woman's. Why'd you come in here?! One has an urgency of the bowels, and just wants to use a toilet. Heh! In that case, go straight up, take a left till you hit the wall, go backwards, then turn around, walk forward a couple of steps, and there'll be a chamber pot. Thank you. Thank you. Sheesh! Why is it so complicated? Ugh! Why is the chamber pot hole so small? You would miss shooting into that even if you had good eyes! My friend next door must be constipated with all that grunting. And the tension is gone... Sir, have you seen this person? Thank you. Ma'am, have you seen this person? I haven't seen him. Go and ask someone else. Thank you. Hmm... Why did they say my big brother, Lam Sai-Wing, set up shop in this market? I don't even know where he is. Hot stuff! Well, would you recognise him? He already left for the city when he was really little. This photograph was taken over ten years ago. Good morning, sir. What can I get you? Er... nothing. I just wanted to ask you about this person. Have you seen him before? His name is Lam Sal-Wing. Huh?! Lam Sai-Wing?! He's moved his shop to hell! Go and look for him in the unmarked graves! Go away! Go! Go! Go! Don't get in the way of my business. Let's go. Young maiden, so you've come all the way from the country to find someone? Good sir, have you seen this person? I have. I've seen him. How can you see anything, holding the photograph upside down? This kid? I know him! So scrawny... That's right, we call him Scrawny Pig. Of course it's Scrawny Pig! I play with this kid every chance I get! Wait a minute... This photograph was taken over ten years ago. He should be twenty-something now. I've known him since the day he came to the city. He's my big brother! Of course he is! He talks about you all the time. You're his little brother, right? That's right! Where is he now? Ha! Your brother? Your brother's flourishing and doing really well for himself. Shall I take you to him? - Please! - That'd be great! Great! This way. This here's Scrawny Pig. So he's the big brother you've been looking for. You're really Scrawny Pig? I'm Scrawny Pig! Why are you so long-winded? You don't look anything like you used to! Says who?! Everybody says the older I get, the more I look like how I used to! Then do you know what my nickname is? I'm called Scrawny Pig, and you're called Fat Pig! That's not it! Uh... I misremembered. It's not Fat Pig, it's Dumb Pig! That's not it either! The two of you must be full of it! Yuet-Mui, we're leaving. Don't let them leave. You might not recognise Scrawny Pig as your big brother, but Scrawny Pig recognises you as his little brother. Yeah! As for those 300 pieces of silver he owes me... An older brother's debt is a younger brother's responsibility. That's just the right thing to do. You said my brother's flourishing and doing really well for himself! That's right. But alas, alas... - the only thing flourishing is his leprosy... - Yeah! And the well he's in is full of sewage. So you're just trying to con me! You think I'm some fish out of water?! Hmph... I don't care what you are! If you don't repay this debt... your wife's not going anywhere! You take my wife, I'll take your life! Sai-Kwong! You want to take my life? You must be sick of breathing, then! Heh! Even if I'm not an equal match, I'll take you halfway for now! Die! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Help me serve our guest! - Sai-Kwong! Sai-Kwong...! Sai-Kwong! Stop fighting...! Stop fighting...! Yuet-Mui... Yuet-Mui...! Stop hurting him...! I'll fight you to the death! Die... Stop it! Sai-Kwong...! Yuet... Mui...! Sai-Kwo... Yuet-Mui! Sai-Kwong! Yuet-Mui! Sai-Kwong! We're always practising the same old set of moves. I'm bored to death! Yeah! What the hell's up with Master? He hasn't taught us anything new in ages! Are you bad-mouthing Master? Huh?! - No, Master! We're not bad-mouthing you! - No, Master! We're not bad-mouthing you! As punishment, you must treat Wing to Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. - Treat Wing to food?! - Treat Wing to food?! - Damn it! Trying to fool us?! - Damn it! Trying to fool us?! Wait... 'cause I managed to fool you means I'm pretty great, yeah? Ah... you fat bastard, that's a pretty good impression of Master! It's good, huh? Let me show you some more! . Wong Feil. Hung. As a child lost his life. Life-giving mother. This turtle. Is actually my dad. My dad's pet. Laughing now? It's good, isn't it? There's more! Foon, Seven. Go and fetch me a whore! A whole bowl of chicken rice! And we'll have to strip. The feathers off the chicken! Wing. Wing! Wing! Wing! Wing what?! Why haven't you poured me some tea yet?! How is it? Not bad, but a bit cold. Don't do it again! Ma... Master...! What Master?! Finish your tea first. Master is leaving! Master... please don't go. You do such a good impression of Master. I might as well pack my things and retire to the country. See? Already packed. M-master... I promise I won't do it again. You promise? Hmph! Master, is there somewhere you need to be? Yes. I am going to Kwangsi to purchase medicinal herbs. Since it is on the way, I will also visit Zhulin Temple and pay my respects to the Golden Zen Master. I am instructing the three of you: work hard treating our patients here at Po Chi Lam. And do not, do not go around stirring up trouble. Master, have some faith in us! We won't get into fights ever again! Then what will you do if Ko Ba-Tin's men show up?! Beat 'em! Huh?! If you don't give me back my wife, it's your funeral today! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! H-h-hey! You'd better stop it! Are you trying to kill him?! Die! You don't know anything! This is none of your business! Get outta here! If you don't get lost, I'll beat you up too! Goddamnit! You threatening me?! I'm not scared of anyone! Die! Catch! Ugh... Boss... Gotcha! You fat bastard! You'd better watch your back! Hey! Are you all right? I'm all right. Thanks a lot, boss. What do I call you, 'brother'? My name's Ko Tai-Hoi. Oh! I sell pigs at the market. Everyone calls me Porky Wing. Oh... Brother Wing. To have troubled someone so righteous... let me buy you a drink, eh? That's too kind of you. I insist... I insist... No, it's fine. I insist. - No, it's too much! - You really must join me. Oh all right. Let's go, then. Ah... It's been a while since I've smelled the stench of chickens. Yah damn fat beggar, don' go pickin' at yer feet 'ere! My chickens catch a whiff o' yer stink... they'll get poisoned! Right. Right. Don' even know what yer up to... Yer friggin' mental! Hmm... Those crazy chickens aren't cutting me any slack! Making such a damn racket! Aren't you a greedy one? C'mon down and eat. C'mon down and eat. Peck! Peck! You shouldn't drink so much if you can't hold your liquor. People drink and get drunk, but you drink and get killed! I can't hold my own in a scrap. I'm a wimp compared to the tough guys. And now my wife's been taken too! I'm better off dead! H-h-h-h-h-h-hey, friend? Can I bother you for a sec? Is there a kitchen here? Of course there is! It's just behind you over there! Thanks. Thanks. Friend? What now? Can I borrow your kitchen? It's not like you'll be using it anymore! That's true... It's all yours! In that case, thanks a lot. I'm busy even when I'm dead! H-h-hey! This money, why don't you lend it to me? It's not like you'll be using it anymore! This shirt's in my size. It's not like you'll be using it anymore, right? You...! Your pants... give 'em to me too! Let's not waste them. It's not like you'll be using them anymore! I'm gonna borrow the rope as well. It's not like you'll be using it anymore! I almost choked...! You've still got breath, right? Just a little. Hey, you should give that up too. It's still good so let's not waste it. C'mon! Now... I'm gonna borrow your breath to start up the stove. What happened to your face? Is that Ko Tai-Hoi really so tough? Sure is. He's got a lot of power. I've heard... he has several parts of the city under his control. Wow! Th-th-th-then he's more powerful than the electricity company! Even if you know, you can't do anything about it... I can't do anything?! Back in the day, not even ten big guys could get one over me! Old folks sure love going on about "back in the day". Oh. So you're just saying I'm old?! Ginger gets spicier the older it gets! Here... wine, the longer it's aged, the finer it gets! Watch this. Heh! My bridge hands are hard enough. My horse stance is steady enough. My punches are powerful enough. The wine is... strong enough. Hey, dear customer! What can I get you? Yuk Ping Shu. From the looks of you I think you're delirious! How about Mei Kuei Lu then? Get the hell outta here! Uh... Just Ma Jin is fine. No need. Brother Hoi... Erm... I'm a bit tight lately... After that last game of dominos, you still owe me ten bucks... I, Ko Tai-Hoi, a person of such status and prestige... can't owe you ten bucks?! Why don't you announce it in the streets? Just asking. Asking is not allowed! What's up? Hit me?! Nah, just having a scratch. You call that a scratch?! Fighting back too, now?! No! It's not my fault! Aren't you a tough guy? Your toes are treading on my soles! Like it needs to be said! This is my first time treading on someone like this, too! How do you normally tread then? I used to do it... like this! C'm o Nn! 1 C' m on ! Hey, hit me all you want, but don't hit the wine! Wha?! What a waste. Do you have a beef with the wine?! You've spilled all the wine, pay up! I'll pay. I'll pay you. This is yours. Ko Tai-Hoi, you better release Lam Sai-Kwong's wife, Cheung Yuet-Mui. Who's Cheung Yuet-Mui? Still faking it, huh? I remember... I remember... If you remember, then speak up! But... she's currently with my 'big brother'. Who's your 'big brother'? Porky Wing. Where is he now? It's really hard to find him now. How about I'll tell him to bring Cheung Yuet-Mui and wait for you at Yuet Loi Teahouse tomorrow? You'd better not pull anything funny. I won't... I won't... [YUET LOI TEAHOUSE] That old fart's really up himself! You're my friend, she's your wife, and he dares mess with you?! Yeah! He even said that if I don't hand over my wife to him today, I'm gonna be done for. So in the end, I name-dropped you, Brother Wing. Huh? Is that right? Do I really have that much face? So what did he say, then? He said... I should buy you a coffin, and dig a hole ready. Wha?! That son of a bitch! That really pisses me off! When he gets here, you tell him to go through me! Hmph! What's taking him so long? I'm gonna wait for him outside! What's taking him so long? Hey, old man, be careful, will you?! Uh... thanks... t-thanks a lot. What the hell?! Where is he?! He's already here. Thought you could hide from me? Old man! My boss is here! The person you want... ask him for 'em! You... you're the one called Porky Wing? What a stink! Have you rinsed this morning yet? I haven't rinsed. Uh... waiter, Yuk Ping Shu. Here. Old man, you're not here today just to rinse your mouth out, right? You reminded me. You'd better hand her over now! Hand?! There's a lot of hands down here in the south. Do you want a pair, a straight, or a flush? Ah... You've got a pretty big head. Not as big as yours! You've got the same personality and tone as an old pal of mine. Who? Jesus! He's all talk, and I can't get a word in. Heh! Well, you've got the same character as an old pal of mine! Who? Ximen Qing! He stole another man's wife, so he got beaten to death in the end. Huh? What are you talking about? I'm talking in proper Cantonese! Hey, Brother Wing, do you actually think you're Jesus? What's with the sermon? Hey, hit him already! Hey! Do you really want her? Heh! By hook or by crook! Ah! If I hit you, then I'd be a bully. I respect you old people. I'll let you get in three punches first. Hmph! If you're given an advantage, then there's no harm taking it! Let's go, it's a fight! - Hurry up! Let's go! - C'mon! C'mon! Hey! I've still got two more. Oh no! You old bastard, could you play any dirtier?! That was three punches in one. You've still got two more, but you can forget it! Wow! That's Hung Gar! Hey, who's your master? What's it to you?! All that matters is you're not my master! I'm just an old fart, right? Still on, tiger? I'll eat you alive! The sleeping crane swallows its body. Brother Wing, are you all right? I'm fine! I was just a bit careless, that's all. Then you'd better be more careful this time. Hissing head of the fleeing snake. Oh? Even playing with snakes? H-h-h-h-hey! What're you doing? M-my-my foot...! Looks like fatty's done for. Are you gonna hand over the woman or not? Even if you beat me up so my head starts looking like a pig's, I, Lam-Sai-Wing, won't hand over anything! Huh?! So you're Lam Sai-Wing?! You think I've got a double? Heh! Aren't you a bad egg, even stealing your little brother's wife? What little brother?! Your little brother: Lam Sai-Kwong! That over there's Lam Sai-Kwong. You piece of shit! Die! Die! D-die! Hey...! Let go of me! Let me beat him to death! He's the big brother you've been looking for: Scrawny Pig! That's right... I'm Scrawny Pig! You're really Scrawny Pig? I'm as real as it gets! I'm not lying to you. That's me! You're not as fat in the photograph... All right, then! What was I called when I was little? Oh! You were called Scabby Cow! That's right! Also, when you were little, I always used to hit you like this! Big Brother! Little Brother! Why'd you help that scumbag beat me up the other day?! How was I to know that was you...? If you didn't know, why did you randomly help him? You hit me back just now. Let's call it even. So I hit you back, but what's the use? My wife, Yuet-Mui, already got taken by that son of a bitch. I don't even know what to do now! Ko Tai-Hoi... you've really made a fool outta me... Come with me! I'll sort out this mess with your wife! Don't be scared. I'm here to rescue you. Really? Who are you? There's no time for talk. Hurry up and follow me! That's some gall you have. You wanna let my girl go?! You don't know when to stop. If you release her... you'll be the one out of luck. Young Master?! Someone called Lam Sai-Wing with a tied-up old guy's looking for you. You keep an eye on the two of them for me. Hi, Brother Hoi! Brother Wing... so you... managed to beat the old guy? Oh! Nothing makes up for the virility of youth! This old coot was all high and mighty at first. But in the end, he ran out of breath! So then I took him down! Brother Wing, you've really got it! We'll put the old fart in the store room. Then we'll go and have a drink, celebrate a bit. Great! Let's stick him in there first. Come on. Move it, old man! Why are you doing it for real? It's not believable if ll don't put some muscle into it. Move it! C'mon, stick him in the storeroom over there. H-h-hey, Brother Hoi? This room has guards. It must be the treasury. Open the door! Open the door! Let us out! Hurry up and let us out! - No, this room belongs to my wife. - Open the door! We were afraid the old fart would try and mess with her. That's why I've got people keeping an eye on her. Let us out! - Old man, why are you so obnoxious?! - Open the door! - Messing with people now?! - Open the door! Uh... oh, if that's what he says, I should mess with him, then! Ha! I don't believe it. If you don't believe it, untie these ropes and try me! Don't think I won't. Hmph! Hurry up and let us out! W-w-w-wait! There's nothing to fear with me here! I'm gonna mess with you now. Try and stop me! - Oh no, Brother Wing... - Don't worry! Hey... it's none of your business. H-hey, which one of you is Yuet-Mui? I'm Lam Sai-Wing! I am. Oh! Come with me! She... Oh, her too? I'll be charitable and save you too! I am... Oh, you must be the same as her. Come on! H-h-hey, we're all done here. You can drink when we're home! Oh, let's go then. Come on, less talk and drink up! Now that the brothers are reunited. And husband and wife are together again. Everyone is happy! She... she must be another one Ko Tai-Hoi kidnapped. [, Lam Sai-Wing, was amidst one rescue already, so I freed her as well while I was at it! Wing? Acts of courage in the name of justice: definitely worth drinking to! I'm mll? "I'm hungry" so eat up! Help yourself, don't be shy. We're all family here It's all the same. I am Ko... Oh, I know! You're really content now, right? Of course you are. You've escaped a wretched plight! I'm trying to say that I'm Ko Ba-Tin's goddaughter. What a know-it-all! Uh... I'm also happy for you. Ah... c-c-c-c-come on! Uh... I also raise a glass to you. No, it's all right, you're too kind. I insist! - No, you're too kind. - Insist! Insist... - I'll help myself! - Insist... I Insist! I'll help myself. Oh, you'll help yourself? Then I'll help myself, too! Such fine wine, and none of you are drinking... Ah! What a waste! From the look on your face, Ko Tai-Hoi must have had his way with you. It's nothing really. I, Lam Sai-Wing, won't tell a soul. Later on when you go back to your hometown and get married, just pretend it was all a bad dream. Forget all about it. That's even more reason why you should celebrate. Eh? Why's it spinning again? He's drunk! Hey! You don't have to look at with me with such gratitude-filled eyes. [, Lam Sai-Wing, don't do good deeds to be rewarded! Stupid fatty, acting so smart. Hmm...! Just wait for this little miss to have a bit of fun with you. Big Brother? It's already late; I think we'll get going. In that case... All right, you two get going. Now, first thing tomorrow, pack your things and come and live here with me. All right. And there's still you. You need to get going, too. Hey! It was you who forcibly dragged me out here! Now I don't have a home to go back to, you tell me where I should go! Huh?! It's that big a deal?! In that case... In that case what? It's not my problem. At any rate... I'm not going anywhere tonight! Huh? H-h-h-h-hey! I don't even know you! How can you stay here? You don't know me, but you dragged me back here. What are you planning?! The heavens smite me for my kindness! How come it didn't smite you death, then? Oh, miss... Let's just say I'm scared of you. At the very least I'll put you up in an inn. That's fine, right? If you've got so much money, why don't you give it to charity? I'm nobody, you're a big shot. Do I need to light some firecrackers to send you on your way? You kicked my foot, and it really hurts! Where's it hurt? Let me rub it for you. Stupid fatty! Trying to cop a feel?! Touch me again, and I'll cry rape! Why are you so hot-headed? Are you gonna leave?! My foot hurts, so I can't walk... Unless you carry me. If a woman rides on your back, it's three years of bad luck, though... Count me out! You won't carry me? I'm not leaving, then! I'll carry you... I'll carry you... But I'm gonna carry you like a sow! A real pain in the arse... Easy come, but not easy go! Come on, on my back! It really hurts! Don't worry, steady on! [SPIRIT REVIVING MEDICINAL WINE] This here's medicinal wine passed down to me from my master. Even if your bones are shattered to pieces, drink half, rub on the rest, you'll be right as rain! My bones haven't shattered... But... I got nudged hard in the chest. Where? Let me have a look. My master hasn't taught me about this part of the body yet. Apply it yourself on the bed. What a pain...! I'm not going tonight. I'm gonna bunk with you. Why was there a woman's voice? Oh... I had too much to drink. I've got a raspy throat, that's all. Raspy throat? Huh? Wha? W-What is it? Mosquitoes. See? Mosquitoes...? Mosquitoes...? Are you gonna leave? If you're not leaving, I'm leaving! M... mosquitoes? Gotta sleep even with mosquitoes! Let's go out for another round! My treat. - There's more wine to drink? - Yeah... yeah... Oh! G-g-g-g-good! Good... goo... If there's wine to drink, that's a different story...! Stupid fatty, you nudged my chest really hard. You're really gonna get it when you come back! What are you doing?! I'm your sister! Hey, you're just someone my old man adopted. What's there to worry about? Isn't this what they call, "keeping it in the family"? You! Over here! Scream?! Scream?! Stop screaming! You gonna keep making all that noise?! All that noise?! Scream...? Scream...! You gonna keep screaming?! You're done screaming, right?! Gonna be quiet now, huh? Ko Tai-Hoi?! Dad?! Lam Sai-Wing ran off with Ian-Sam earlier on! I secretly tailed them, and saw him take Ian-Sam back to his house. I've come back to get help. Lam Sai-Wing... you beard the lion in his den! We leave! It's so dark in here... The ill-tempered missy must've gone! Head's spinning, eyes all fuzzy. I should sleep. Don't keep me up! You don't listen, no matter how many times I tell you! You'd sleep here even if it'd kill you! Hey! You better wake up now! You're still playing dead? Hey, wake up! She really did die in here? This ain't good. How did this happen? No, I should report it first. Why are you all here?! It's him! Lam Sai-Wing, what gall you have! How dare you lay a hand on the daughter of Ko Ba-Tin?! She's your daughter?! Ian-Sam! Ian-Sam! She's already dead! You...! It had nothing to do with me! Dad, he's killed Ian-Sam! H-h-h-h-hey! Watch your mouth! I already said I didn't kill her! If you didn't kill her, who did? Me?! Ian-Sam... Ian-Sam! Ian Sam...! You have blood on your hands. How can you still deny it?! I didn't do it, so why should I confess?! The price of murder... is your own life! Don't come any closer! Whoever moves is whoever dies! Ian-Sam! Don't come any closer! Unhand him! If I'm willing to let him go, are you willing to let me go? Move it! No need for pursuit! We will take them at Po Chi Lam! [PO CHI LAM] Hmph! Tear it down! Yes! Strange Cat, lie in wait for him at the entrance. - Kill whoever comes out! - Aye! - We go out back! - Aye! Tell Wong Fei-Hung to come out! Master is away. Why are you looking for him? He's looking for my master to learn Hung Kuen, of course. Aren't you a bit old to be burning the midnight oil? I want him to hand over Lam Sai-Wing! Lam Sai-Wing hasn't come back! Hmph! I don't believe it! Search! Hey, hold it! Since when can you just waltz into Po Chi Lam and rummage around? Whoever moves, is whoever gets it! Hand over Lam Sai-Wing, or I'll tear Po Chi Lam to the ground! If I said he hasn't come back, he hasn't come back! For tearing down Po Chi Lam's sign, I'll take your lives! Monkey's Heaven's Gate Staff? Y-you...! Knife up your sleeve? Heh, your sleeve knife's only good for fighting up close. Keep my distance, attack from afar, and your knife's useless! You...! Hold this! He's torn down our sign?! Lam Sai-Wing! You crawl out at last?! Ko Ba-Tin... H-how dare you tear down... Po Chi Lam's sign...? I told Wong Fei-Hung before, if his disciples caused any trouble, I would tear down his sign. You killed my goddaughter... Both debts will be paid for now! ...didn't kill her! Dad? They don't deserve any mercy. Kill him! Let me at 'em! Let's go! [LAM ANCESTRAL HALL] Five Element Cinnabar Palm?! I didn't kill anyone... I didn't kill anyone! You tore down Po Chi Lam's sign... I'll take your lives! Damn it... he really got me. And I can't pay him back for it, either. You two, hold him down. If he socks me again, I'll sock the two of you. Will Wing be all right? With me around, he's not gonna die. With Po Chi Lam in such a state, why aren't the two of you out looking for your master? In that case... we'll leave Wing in your care, old sir. What happened to me? If I hadn't bathed you in medicine, forcing your bruises out, the King of Hell would've taken you in as his son-in-law ages ago. H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hey! Damn it! What are you doing, huh?! I have to finish off Ko Ba-Tin! What are you doing? You wanna go streaking? Where are Foon and Seven? Keep your head. They've gone looking for your master. Po Chi Lam's sign's been torn down. I can't even look at Master right now. Y'know, your kung fu isn't bad at all. But your bridge hands still aren't tough enough. Luckily, your life has been tough enough. The 12 Bridge Hands of Hung Gar are a treasure of the martial arts world. Huh? Didn't your master teach them to you? Do you know 'em? A little here and there. You wanna learn? So I've got another master now?! Shut it! All this master and student stuff, it's too old fashioned. How about you call me Big Godbrother instead? R-r-right... right... Big Godbrother! Damn! Then doesn't that make me a little bastard?! The 12 Bridge Hands of Hung Kuen. Despatch Bridge. Division Bridge. Steadfast Bridge. Inch Bridge. Straight Bridge. Soft Bridge. Hard Bridge. Flow Bridge. Resolution Bridge. Lift Bridge. Authority Bridge. You've got authority, but I'm a rebel. I might have a problem with authority, but you don't have to lie in the dirt over it. Lam Sai-Wing... let's see how far you've flown. Strange Cat! Dead or alive, you will claw Lam Sai-Wing back to me! Oh... It's only a stupid cat. You scared me to death. Hmm... you shouldn't be hiding inside coffins. Huh? You're one of Five Dragon Hall's goons. Maybe it's not your time, having escaped my fatal move: The Phantom Cat Snares a Rat. Your mum's the rat! You killed one of Five Dragon Hall's own. Even if you hide in the depths of hell, I'll claw you back out! Jumping around like that... It's about time you got smacked! Huh...? Oil? I'll beat you till you're screaming like a cat in heat! Let's see where you jump to now! If you use Sticky Horse, he won't be able to jump anymore. Sticky Horse? Ha! I haven't moved, but you make a move on me? Wow! Why's your palm strength so powerful? That was nothing. I haven't even unleashed my Iron Sand Palm yet. Iron Sand Palm? Hey, how about you teach it to me? Learning Iron Sand Palm is really punishing. Gotta soak both your hands in vinegar, then jab them in sand. It's too much for you. H-h-h-Hey! That's enough talk. They managed to find us even in this place. We gotta go somewhere else. Huh? H-hey! Hey! Hey! We'll indulge in some baiyun trotter, really live it up a bit. Little Godbrother! Little Godbrother? Today, I'll teach you something good, a speciality of mine. Great! Great. What kind of wine is this? Hey, silly piggy. This here's vinegar. Vinegar? Learning Iron Sand Palm is really punishing. Gotta soak both your hands in vinegar, then jab them in sand. Oh... you gonna teach me Iron Sand Palm? C'mon now, you think learning Iron Sand Palm is that easy?! Take this and marinate the pig's trotters! Hmm... Pig's trotters...? Ah! I know what to do! Aren't you supposed to soak them after training? Shave off all the hairs before you marinate. Shave off all the hairs? If you can't shave it clean, burn it off with fire. Wha?! I've gotta burn it with fire, too? No wonder so few people... know Iron Sand Palm. If you practise it... you can't even grow any hair. Burn off the hair nice and clean, then rub some salt into them. Wha?! I've still gotta... rub them with salt? Rub harder! Then slice off the fingernails with a knife. How do I slice them? When you're done slicing, chop them into little pieces. Chop harder! You don't want them sticking together! Having them not stick together... It's not impossible, but... It's really hard! What's so hard? Let me show you how it's done. H-h-hey! What are you doing? Where are the trotters? The pig's trotters... They're right here. Damn it! I told you to marinate in vinegar to make baiyun trotters! Wha?! Baiyun trotters? Weren't you teaching me how to practise Iron Sand Palm? Bust! Bust! These three win, the rest are bust. C'mon, you betting or what? Place your bets! Bets! Place your bets! This? Keep it for scrounging in the dirt. I told you to follow my lead. Brother Hoi, I've got something juicy I wanna discuss with you. What? It's too crowded here. Let's go over there. Keep betting. Hey, what's this juicy thing you got? Hey! Hey! There's so many people around, don't try anything. This ring... how'd you get it? Well, one night... y'know? I was on my nightly patrol, right? I went past Lam Sai-Wing's house... and... I think you know the rest, yeah? Here. Let's say I'm buying the ring back from you with this money. If it's only enough for scrounging in the dirt, I've already got that much. Keep it for yourself. In that case... how much do you want? 100 taels?! 1000 taels! Are you trying to take my chariot? Would you rather lose a chariot, or do you want it to be checkmate? Even if I pay him off this time, this guy'll just keep coming back for more. There's only one thing to do. All right. I'll give you your money. But I don't have that much money on me. Come with me and I'll get the rest. Of course! But you'd better not pull anything. Of course! We're gentlemen, aren't we? You wanna get money off me? Go and ask the King of Hell instead! Lam Sai-Wing... Lam Sai-Wing... Lam Sai-Wing...! Hey, Lam Sai-Wing isn't here. Why are you looking for him? I know... who the murderer is... Huh? Who is it?! It's Ko... Ko... Ko Tai-Hoi...! That's right. I was the one who killed Ian-Sam. Even if you know... it's useless. You won't live to tell Lam Sai-Wing the truth. Stay back! Sai-Kwong, you all right? Hurry up and find Brother Wing! Go now. Go! Damn it! Go now! Yuet-Mui! Go! Brother Wing! Brother Wing! Brother Wing! Yuet-Mui, why are you in a flurry? Sai-Kwong is in a lot of danger! Ko Tai-Hoi is out for blood! What do you mean, "out for blood"? On the night Ian-Sam died, the night watchman Luk found this ring on the scene. He said Ko Tai-Hoi is the real culprit! C'mon. Sai-Kwong...! Sai-Kwong! Sai-Kwong...! Sai-Kwong... Sai-Kwong...! Sai-Kwong! Sal... Kwong... Ko. Tai. Hoi... Ko Tai-Hoi! I'm gonna give everyone a kiss tonight, but I'll be starting with mummy. Hey! What are you doing? - Getting on the barge. - Yeah! Young Master Ko has the barge to himself tonight. They don't want your business. Go away! - Go away! - What is this? I'm willing to lose a few years of my life, if I could be this happy every night! Your turn. I'll grant you your wish, then! Ko Tai-Hot... The indignation for killing my younger brother. There can only be retribution. Today, I will have you pay in blood! [SPIRIT TABLET OF THE DECEASED YOUNGER BROTHER LAM SAI-KWONG] Brother Wing... Brother Wing, we can talk about this. Brother Wing! N-no! We can talk about this. Brother Wing. Brother Wing... Brother Wing. Brother Wing... Brother Wing... Don't kill me! I know I was wrong! I'm not human! I deserve to die! I'm not human... I deserve to die! I'm not human! I'm worse than a beast! I deserve to die! Brother Wing, don't kill me! I don't wanna die yet...! Spare me! I won't kill you. Thank you, Brother Wing! Thank you, Brother Wing! However, my little brother... He wants you to keep him company down there. Little brother! Have your revenge! [SPIRIT TABLET OF BELOVED SON KO TAI-HOI] For as long as I have lived... l have had only this one son. And yet, Lam Sai-Wing... you have killed him. My son... I must tear out Lam Sai-Wing's heart, offer it to you as sacrifice. [PO CHI LAM] I hung up a new sign for Po Chi Lam today. Now Master won't scold me when he gets back! Er... Little Godbrother, don't get too happy yet. Look. Hoi, watch as your father avenges you! Lam Sai-Wing! Ko Ba-Tin, a good dog knows not to block the road. What's the meaning of your mad barking? You caused the death of my goddaughter. And even killed my son. Today, I will have you make it even! Watch what you say! Your goddaughter was actually killed by your own son! Bullshit! Huh? ll don't smell it! The revenge I took for my little brother's death was fair in the eyes of heaven and earth! Then I invite you, one so virtuous, to kill me as well! How could I kill you? You think you're a pig? Yeah! If you want a butcher to slaughter pigs, it's gonna cost you! If you won't kill me... I will kill you! Gold Comes Full Circle Unleashing your Five Element Palm, huh? You must be itching for the five elements of getting smacked. Hard Bridge! Leopard: Hard Form! Each blow is as strong as iron! Wood Needs to be Sharp! Soft Bridge! A snake tangled around a bundle: Soft, Authority, Hard. Snake: Soft Form! Water Raises Waves! More like you're just raising your head! The water is up to your eyebrows now! A dragon has authority over water. Despatch Bridge! Dragon Form! My Black Dragon Swings its Tail is really something, yeah? There's still my Earth Dragon! Heavenly Dragon! Twin Dragons of Heaven and Earth! Argh! My spine...! Watch out for his palms! Fire Brings the Wind...! Heh! Come up here if you've got what it takes! Uh-oh! That was close. Don't worry, steady on. Crane: Spiritual Form! A crane forced into an inch, its strength is chained together. Earth in Deadly Pursuit! Lam Sai-Wing, play with my son down in hell! Put down the spirit tablet! No way! Godbrother, how are your hands? Oh, he's about the same as me. He can't exert any more power in his Cinnabar Palm. Hey, you can break his Five Element Palm now. Five Element Palm? To break the Five Element Palm, seal the three parts of the arm. Opening seal: Subdue the wrist with Inch Bridge. Second seal: Attack the elbow with Hard Bridge. Second seal! Third seal is the shoulder! Bridge enters the third seal, anything goes! Eh... Brother Fook-Sing, what a surprise. Fei-Hung, you're only back now? Show's over! Seven, help him up now! Wing! Wing! Bringing me misfortune again! Someone tore down our sign, no? Uh... no. I've hung it back up now. Take a look...! Master, good stuff, huh? Hmph! Take a look! WV IHD 0d]
