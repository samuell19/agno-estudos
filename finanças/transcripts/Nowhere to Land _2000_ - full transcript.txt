[PHONE BEEPS] Hot date in LA? -Our anniversary -Oh, how long? -Ten years. -KIM: Wow, that's impressive. Especially for a captain. How's our weather look? Smooth to Hawaii, some chop after, no big deal. Good, maybe we'll get you some first seat hours. See if you can get a place in line. -I'll take care of the bags -Okay. TONY: We're on the L.A. flight. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Make sure you write now. -You have a good trip home. WOMAN: Yeah, and you have a good trip home. Yeah, yeah, oh, it's, it's not that bad, It's going to heal in no time. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hon? I have an idea. Why don't we stay a couple more days? You know we got to get back. We'll come again, for our second honeymoon. -Promise? -Mm-hmm. WOMAN: Next please. [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT] WOMAN OVER PA: Domestic arriving has... Hi, guys. Hey, Maggie. How's our head count? We're light, about half full. -Hey, Kim. -Don't. -What? -Ask her about last night. -Maggie. -JOHN: Maggie. I don't get into people's personal business. Thank you. MAGGIE: I'll see you guys in a while. -So what did happen last night? -[CHUCKLES] Did you get that final fuel weight? Oh, c'mon, you can tell me. I thought you didn't get involved in people's personal business. -I lied. -KELLY: Mm-hmm. WOMAN OVER PA: Casey Parlow, please report to check in. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SECURITY GUARD: Through, please [METAL DETECTOR BEEPS] [BEEPS] Sir, raise your arms, please. [METAL DETECTOR WHIRING] Please go back through, and empty your pockets. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SECURITY GUARD: Looks fine. -Paul. -Sir. Empty the bag, please. It's a gift for my wife. [♪♪♪] You know the song? Yeah, thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN OVER PA: This is a pre-boarding announcement... Excuse me, is anyone sitting here? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Ready to board passengers, John? -Yeah, let them in. -Oh, Maggie. Don't be surprised if we hit a little turbulence, right around mealtime. MAN OVER PA: Attention passengers on Flight 762 to Los Angeles we're beginning our pre-boarding. Passengers needing special assistance, and passengers with small children may enter the aircraft at this time. Attention, passengers on Flight 762. We are now boarding all first and business class passengers only. Thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN OVER PA: Attention, passengers on Flight 762 to Los Angeles. This is your final boarding call. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, do you need me to move? Oh, no, no, no. Stay right where you are. -I'll just move over. -[CHUCKLES] -Got it. -[CHUCKLES] -You on the US team? -Oh, yeah, yeah, till, I, uh, came off the verticals a little wocky. [CHUCKLES] It's like a promotional tour. We shouldn't even be here in the first place. Right. -I'm Chad. -NATALIE: Natalie. [CHAD CHUCKLES] I thought you'd be more homesick by now. -[CHUCKLES] -What? It's just been great to get away. Thank you. Some champagne for you, Mr. and Mrs. Munson? -Oh, thanks. -Thank you. You've been thinking about Phillip? But only now that we're going home. Just around there, yes, to your right. WOMAN: Hi. Hi, Maggie. -George. -[GEORGE CHUCKLES] -What a surprise. -GEORGE: Yeah. I just can't stay away. Thought I'd check, and make sure you're doing a good job. -Oh, you miss us. -GEORGE: Who's, uh, who's on the flight deck? -MAGGIE: John. -GEORGE: Prescott? -MAGGIE: He'll be happy to see you. -GEORGE: Ah, yes. -No, no. I know the way. -Okay. -See you soon. -See you later. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: It's-- it's aisle... I don't know, 32. WOMAN: Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WHIRS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Hi, John. -JOHN: George. George, what the hell are you doing here? Vacation. The girls had to go home early for a wedding, while I went deep sea fishing. George Eller, say hi to Kim McGee, my co-pilot. -Hi, Kim. -Hi. George basically taught me how to fly, just retired last year. Ah, I've heard many a George Eller -tale on these long hauls. -Don't believe them. You guys got work to do. You look better in that seat than he did. -Nice meeting you, Kim. -[JOHN CHUCKLING] Listen, when we reach cruising, come on back up. Okay, I will. [PANTS] -Hi. -Hi. You American? I guess most people on this flight are. This was my first time to Australia. It's amazing, how much it's like home. Were you on vacation? [PANTS] Are you okay? I don't know. I feel kind of dizzy all of a sudden. Excuse me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PANTS] MAGGIE: Sir, can I help you? I'm having chest pains. I'd like to get off. I can call for a doctor? It-- it might just be a panic attack. Yeah, look, I'm sorry, but we can't hold the plane. You're, you're going to have to switch to a later flight. -Well, that might be best. -Well, why don't you take a seat -this will just take a second. -[EXHALES DEEPLY] May I see your ticket, please? -MAGGIE: "46-H?" -Yeah. I'll be right back. Are you going to be all right? I'm calling on passenger Phillip Deacon, Oceanic 762 to Los Angeles. Yeah, I need to know if he's checked any luggage through. All right, thank you. -Is that man going to be okay? -I'm sure he is. -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Is that your carry-on? Uh-huh, he took everything with him. MAN: Yeah. [CHUCKLES] -Captain Prescott here. -It's Maggie. The passenger in 46-H is feeling chest pains, wants to exit the aircraft. JOHN: Did he check any luggage through? No, just the two carry-ons he's got with him. -Okay, let 'em go. -Okay. -Sir, you can go. -Oh. -Thanks. -Are you going to be all right? Yeah, yeah. WOMAN OVER PA: May I have your attention please? Captain Socho, Alan Briwinger, and Wesley Knight, please come to the gate check in please. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PANTS] [ENGINE REVVING] KIM: Sydney Ground, Oceanic 762 off gate 19, requesting taxi. MAN OVER RADIO: Oceanic 762. Clear to taxi runway two. Over right, via taxi wait bravo. Yeah, well, if Maggie hadn't been there, there wouldn't have been any witnesses at all. How many times have you broken up with this guy? I know, I know but I had no idea he was in Sydney. I thought he'd flown to Europe. then we got to talking, and... [CHUCKLES] And before you know it... God, I hate pilots. [CHUCKLES] Captain, it's Maggie, meal's done, you want -to make the announcement? -JOHN: Will do. JOHN OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Prescott. We've got a long flight ahead of us tonight, so as a courtesy to the other passengers, I'd appreciate it if you keep your cabin shades drawn. We're right now flying at about 39,000 feet, we have smooth air ahead of us, but if you decide to take a bit of rest, maybe you want to keep your seat belts fastened. Have a very good night. We'll see you in the morning. [PHONE LINE RINGS] BRANDT OVER PHONE: Oceanic Airlines, Brandt speaking. PHILLIP: I want you to put me in contact with the, the head of flight security. BRANDT: Go ahead, sir. PHILLIP: I want you to listen very carefully, this is not a hoax. I have personally placed a device, inside the passenger cabin of Flight 762. -Thanks. -JOHN: Thank you. [EXHALES DEEPLY] When I flew cargo, Frankfurt, JFK, I thought that was long, this just takes forever. Well, how many times have you done this leg, now? [SIGHS] I don't know, 20? What about you? [CHUCKLES] A few more times than that. The minute I get home, I am heading straight to the hot tub. Well, we're halfway past Hawaii it's downhill from there. [BEEPING] Oceanic Flight 762, -go ahead. -MAN OVER PA: Go ahead, sir. John, it's Jeff Belmont at LAX flight ops. Listen, about three minutes ago we received a phone call, from an outside party who claimed to have placed a device aboard your aircraft. Now, I'm going to play you a tape of the call. Then you'll know exactly as much as we do. PHILLIP OVER PHONE: I have personally placed a device. inside the passenger cabin of Flight 762. Any attempt to handle, move or disarm the device will cause a catastrophic event. There is an envelope in seat 50-H. It is addressed to Claire Munson, a passenger. She must read the letter inside the envelope. She will then confirm, this is real... that I'm real. And that the crew and passengers of Oceanic Flight 762 have one hour to live. -MAGGIE: We have to open it. -Claire Munson? Remind me to apologize to Claire later, will you? "Dearest Claire, till death do us part, remember that? Do you also remember the day we were married? I'd give anything to have that day back. JOHN OVER RADIO: I've never stopped loving you. You will always be my wife, underlined. Think about what you've done to me, and how much you've hurt me, You and the man you married have 60 minutes to think about that, Phillip." That's it, no demands? Just a jealous ex-husband? I know the person who can tell us. -Excuse me, Claire Munson? -Yes? The Captain would like to see you. JOHN: Hello, Mrs. Munson, I'm Captain Prescott. We've been made aware of a situation that might concern you. Do you know a man named, Phillip Deacon? This was found in a seat pocket in the rear cabin. Oh, my God. JOHN: He called in a bomb threat a few minutes ago. Now, there was a Phillip Deacon who boarded the plane in Sydney but he got off, right before we left. Phillip was in Sydney? -I... -JOHN: What we need to know, Mrs. Munson, is how seriously we should take this? Very, he could never deal with the fact that we... -JOHN: Would he know anything about... -...broke up. ...explosives, how to build a bomb, -anything like that? -He's an engineer, he works for Garner Chemical, he could make anything. Well, why bomb a plane? There's hundreds of innocent people. My new husband works for this airline he's in marketing, but, I think we can deem this credible. You have to land. We need to get everyone off this plane. JOHN: The problem is, there's nowhere to land. We've passed equal time point between, Hawaii and the West Coast. L.A.'s our only choice. Well, how much time do we have? According to the letter, sixty minutes. -How long until Los Angeles? -Two hours. Jeff, Oceanic 762. We're declaring an emergency. DANNY: Look I'll be there. I know what time the game starts, okay. Just leave the ticket, and we'll call, I'm leaving now, bye. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TELEPHONE RINGS] It's Gorlin better be important, I'm late for the Lakers. Mr. Gorlin? This is Jeff Belmont of Oceanic Air. I'm sorry about the Lakers, but we have a code red on a commercial 747 inbound from Sydney. Someone called in a bomb threat, and it's being deemed highly credible. We need the best man there is, and that's you. [CHUCKLES] Okay so, uh, what do we know, uh, have they located the package? Not yet, but it looks as though it's somewhere in the passenger cabin. -And apparently it's on a timer. -How much time do we have? He said one hour, that was, approximately ten minutes ago. Okay, can you patch me through? JEFF: I'll work on it. He'd been stalking me for over a year, I moved three times, and then for the last few months there was nothing, not a call, not a letter. I was praying that he'd finally given up. -JEFF OVER PA: John, it's Jeff Belmont. -Sh... JEFF: I just got off with reservations. Passenger Phillip Deacon was in seat 46-H. Maggie, Deacon was in 46-H. I checked that area before he left the plane. Why was the note in 50-H? Did you notice if he changed rows, anything? No, all the passengers were coming aboard. They were moving around, it wouldn't have stood out. I'm going to have a look in row 50. -Kim, I don't want you-- -I know. If there's anything there, don't touch it. Let's hope this Phillip Deacon is just trying to just give us a scare. Excuse me, is my wife still up on the flight deck? Oh, yes, sir. Do you have any idea what the Captain wanted to see her about? I'm sure she'll be back down in a few minutes, excuse me. BILL: --especially at this side of the opening and closing ceremonies for this summer's Olympics. So every venue, every accommodation, will be our responsibility. If it takes staying not only the Olympic Village, but in downtown hotels as well, we've really got our work cut out for us. Now I'd like to introduce you to our special American guest from the FBI, -Mike Tanner. -Thank you, Bill. First let me say that I'm not here to give directions, just suggestions. Now we've had a lot of experience with Olympic Security, first in Los Angeles in '84, and then Atlanta in '96. Uh, each of these cities has presented its own set of problems, and I'm sure Sydney will have its own. In many respects Sydney is more like Atlanta than Los Angeles. Each city is an international destination, and as such, a lot of security is already in place. Excuse me, Mike, excuse me. We have a bomb threat on Oceanic 762 en route to Los Angeles. A US citizen, who's believed to be still in Sydney, called it in, now we're going to coordinate things from here. Tom, I want you to get down to headquarters ASAP, the gate agent who saw this guy is heading down there now. Now I want you three guys to get down to the airport... Listen, this is a U.S. airline, with a U.S. citizen under suspicion, so I'm coming with you, okay? Then, hurry up. NATALIE: We tried talking it through, it was hard, but I knew it was the best thing. Hmm, how long were you going out? Pretty serious, junior, senior year, got pretty intense. Hey, if you're going to go to different colleges, and they're like 400 miles way, what's the point? How about you? Being a world class gymnast, and all, you must have the girls lined up. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, right, all I ever do is train. -NATALIE Well, that's kind of a drag. -Hmm. When you've got a goal, it's not. You-- you make a lot of sacrifices but all I've ever done is train since I was five, so. You've never had a serious relationship? -No. Never had time. -MAN: Take another look... There's a good part to that, though. -What? -Never had to break up. [CHUCKLES] -JEFF OVER PA: John, it's Jeff Belmont. -Kim, I need you on headset now. Maggie, will you take, Mrs. Munson outside please? I'm sorry, I'm-- I'm sorry. JEFF: I'm going to patch through, Danny Gorlin with the L.A. Metro Anti-Terrorist Bomb Squad. Go ahead. DANNY OVER PHONE: Am I speaking to the Captain? JOHN: Yes, this is Captain John Prescott with my co-pilot, Kim McGee. Have you located the package? Yes, we have, it's under 50-H on the right at the back of the plane. -Can you describe it to me? -It's a souvenir music box, eight by ten inches, maybe six, seven inches high. KIM: I could see a digital counter on the front, counting back from just over fifty minutes. DANNY: Okay, the caller said it would go off if anyone attempted to handle or move it, so we'll assume it has two triggers, one, time-sensitive, the other motion-sensitive. What if we hit turbulence? Well, that could make for a bad day. We've increased our speed, according to our calculations we're still going to be an hour short of LAX. when the timer goes off. Then we're going to have to get somebody down on the floor, and attempt to disarm it. Disarm it? Either that or let it go off. -I'll do it. -No. -We need you here. -You'll be fine up here. I'm going to have George sent up as well. Mr. Gorlin, I'm going to head back in a minute, I'll be on a cabin headset. Is there any way you can, uh, evacuate the rear section? Sure, absolutely. I'll have those passengers moved up immediately. What will you tell them? [SIGHS] Well, I'm not sure, but I don't think the truth is the best option at this point. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Claire. It's Phillip. [SOBS] -WOMAN: Hey, Salman. -MAN: Grab a bite here. KELLY: What about a sketch artist? Would that help? I don't know, maybe he was pretty ordinary. Did anybody else see him? Yeah, the other agent, she lives on the outside of town she's on her way down now. Did you check to see if he booked a later flight? We couldn't find his name on any flight out of Sydney in the last fourteen hours. I'm calling the States. He's got a passport, we'll get a picture. [PHONE BEEPING] George, the Captain needs to see you. The Captain's requested an "All Call." John, what's up? George, I just declared an emergency, I have a situation I have to deal with in the back. Kim's going to ride first, I'd like you to ride two, okay? Well, of course, but what's happened? I have to brief the cabin crew first. -JOHN OVER PA: Is everyone on? -Yes, sir, we're all on. Okay, here's the deal, we have a bomb threat. We've located a suspicious device under 50-H. I want to evacuate the back of the plane. Bring all of those people up front, seat them if you can, put the others on the floor. I'll be coming on the PA in just a moment to make an announcement. Now the threat is not imminent. We've got a bit of breathing room, and above all, I want those passengers to feel as though that nothing bad is going to happen, is that clear? I know I can count on all of you. JOHN OVER PA: This is Captain Prescott, if I could have your attention, please. Uh, it seems as though we've developed a ventilation problem, in the rear cabin. Before you get nervous, let me just assure you that the plane is flying perfectly, and there's no threat of mechanical malfunction. However, regulations do require that we move you to an unaffected area of the plane until the situation is corrected. So the flight attendants will be asking all of those passengers in the rear cabin to join those passengers in the front cabin. Of course, which some of you will actually have to sit on on the floor, I apologize about the inconvenience, and hopefully you'll be back in your seat shortly, thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] STEWARD: Keep moving, please. Move forward in the plane. with all your belongings, Thank you. Keep moving. JOHN OVER PHONE: Mr. Gorlin, I have a question. If this device actually explodes can this plane take it? Well, if it's a crude device made with black powder, and depending on the location, the 747 could sustain a small blast. What if it's made with something other than black powder? DANNY: C-4? A lump the size of a golf ball, would cause a complete, and very quick disintegration of the entire plane. Everyone stays up front from here on. Got it? -Be careful. -Keep those drapes closed. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] FLIGHT ATTENDANT: We do apologize for the inconvenience, if you could just take any seats that are available. Ladies and gentlemen, please take every available seat. If you cannot find a seat, please sit in the aisle. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This is cool, I've never been up front before. These seats are huge. Just be glad you got a seat. I can't believe they're putting people in the aisles. You were back there, you notice anything wrong with the air? No. The pilot went back there, but it seemed okay. There's something else going on here. The pilot doesn't go to the back of the plane for a ventilation problem. -Well, what do you think it is? -I don't know. I hope I'm wrong, but this has got to be serious. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] See what I mean? -Kim, can you hear me? -KIM OVER PA: I hear you, I'm putting you on speaker. -Go ahead. -DANNY: I'm here, Captain. All right, I'm in position. DANNY: Look, uh, Captain, there's something I got to tell you. Now these days we operate all our equipment, by remote, we rarely disarm a device by hand anymore. Well, that makes me feel a lot better. Well, I don't want to minimize the danger, so you're going to have to follow everything I say -to the letter. -JOHN: All right, your brains, and my hands. Your hands, and your eyes. You like basketball, Captain? -Yeah. -Well, I'm supposed to be at the game tonight, so here's the deal, I'm going to help you disarm this, but you got to make the game up to me. -Deal. -DANNY: Good seats. I'll have you sitting next to the coach. All right. Are you, uh, in front of the device right now? JOHN: Right. Okay, I need you to describe to me exactly what it looks like. I have to see what you see. GEORGE: Even with a straight-in approach, and favorable winds, according to my calculations, we'd have to be lucky. Dave... I need this copied and distributed to everyone working in the terminal, as well as every hotel, and motel -in the vicinity -Is that our guy? Yeah. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? JEFF OVER PHONE: Anne, it's Jeff. John's declared, an on-board emergency. What's wrong? JEFF: Well, we don't have all the details yet, but I can tell you it's non-mechanical, and it's non-weather related. Which leaves what, a hijacking? I really can't tell you anymore. I just wanted to put you on alert. -I'm on my way down there. -JEFF: Anne. [PHONE LINE RINGS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I just overheard what they were saying. They think there's a bomb on board. No, they don't know, right? They're just talking. They wouldn't evacuate the back of the plane unless it was something. Listen, if I told you I wasn't scared, I'd be lying. But right now, it's just a bunch of passengers freaked because they had to change seats. We're going to be all right. You really believe that? Okay, the only thing visible, is the timer, no wires. Should we move this thing to the middle section farther away from the fuselage? If that thing has a motion-sensitive trigger you don't want to risk trying to move it even an inch. First thing we need to do is determine, if the lid has an anti-open trigger. You ready for this? Yes, I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be. DANNY: Okay. Starting with the back, left side of the box, take the knife blade. Slowly, very gently insert it into the lid. Okay, not more than a half-inch. Done. -[EXHALES DEEPLY] -DANNY: Good. Just relax. Remember the, uh, first game of the '97 playoffs? -Utah, Bulls. -DANNY: Remember, uh, Malone's free throw with the game on the line? -Yeah. -DANNY: Okay, well, that's you. Calm, and cool. Just a gentle swish. Now slowly, and very gently, slide the blade forward, eight seconds to an inch, Okay, if you run into anything that even slightly obstructs the blade, stop. JOHN: Moving... still moving. Okay, I made it to the corner. DANNY: Okay, careful. That's where a lot of trip wires are placed. JOHN: Okay. Okay, moving to the front now. Slowly, gentle, just like Karl. Just like Karl, you got it, just a free throw. JOHN: Still moving to the front. All right, listen, don't rush it you have plenty of time. That's easy for you to say. DANNY: Almost there. All right, I've made it to the next corner. TANNER: Huh, no, no, no. Look, as, far as we know, he hasn't left Sydney. -Tanner. -Yeah, uh, hang on. We just had some guy from the motel call in and ID him. Okay, okay, look, we got to go, bye. I'll be with you in a second, ma'am. You two okay? Yeah, all things considered. The police are looking for him, I'm sure they'll find him. What good will that do? He won't tell us how to stop it. He won't. Okay, now we can start to open the lid. DANNY: Once again, very gently, one inch at a time. Okay, the same caution, if you encounter any resistance at all, man, stop. You understand? JOHN: All right. Opening the lid, slowly. [BEEPS] Captain, we're approaching turbulence, possibly severe. I think you should move away from the device. Almost got it. KIM: One good bump, and that thing could go off. Right, Mr. Gorlin? I'm afraid so, you haven't had any rough air yet? KIM: This is the first. KELLY OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we're going to have a bumpy few minutes. For those of you with seats, I want you to fasten your seat belts. For those of you without seats, I want you to sit on the floor, and brace yourself against the nearest seat or wall. Flight attendants, make sure everyone is secure as possible. This is ridiculous. Half these people don't even have seat belts. Ma'am, you can sit there. Sit down, thank you. [BEEPING] We're in it. -Any way around this? -Not that I can see. JOHN: All right, I've got it, I've got the lid open. Can you see inside? [BEEPING] [CREAKING] [BEEPING] [ALL CLAMOR] KIM: We're getting pretty beat up. I've got it at point eight three. KIM: We've got to find a smoother altitude. This is Oceanic 762, east bound on Alpha. Descending out of flight level three-five-zero. Let's go to three-one-zero. I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. Do you have any suggestions, what I can use to secure this thing? You could take some electrical tape, and try to tape it to the floor. It's going to be riskier because, uh, well, you're already into the turbulence. Tape, tape. All right, all right I've got tape. Ladies, and gentlemen, please, I need you to stay quiet. You're not telling us the truth. I need you stay quiet in case we have to issue instructions. Oh, so now we can't even talk. Just keep your voice down, sir. It's a safety issue. Safety issue, yeah. We got half the-- Listen, you're not helping anything. Why don't you just shut up, and let them do their jobs. JOHN: All right, I'm back in position. DANNY: Be careful, don't bump or jerk. It already has been, and it didn't go off. But we don't know its threshold. It may depend on the direction of the motion, without knowing how it's calibrated, we can't take any chances. We better find a way out of this, or we're not going to have time to disarm it. Taking her down to two-nine-zero. Jeff... JEFF: They're okay, Anne, they're okay. I listened to the radio all the way over you know, -just praying that they wouldn't make an announcement. -Yeah. Someone's with Jake, right, I mean, I can call Chris. Yeah, it's okay. The neighbors are with him now. What's going on, Jeff? Okay, come on... Someone called in a bomb threat, just after they crossed the equal time point between here, and Hawaii. And the bomb's in the passenger cabin. -Can't they turn back? -No. Look, we've got an L.A. Metro bomb expert -talking them through it. -Talking them through what? They're trying to disarm it. [BEEPING] Kelly, Federal Police. You ID'd Phillip Deacon? -Yeah, so what's up, guys? -What room's he in? -He's up there in room nine. -MAN: Key. So what's he done anyway? He's gone. These boxes are used to transport biochemical agents. -That stuff's lethal. -Yeah, this has just gotten a whole lot worse. Garner Chemical, get them on the phone. Contains something called SX-19. Yeah, Dave, this is Kelly. I need Garner Chemical on the phone. G-A-R-N-E-R. In the States. We're going to make it out of this, you know that? It's all my fault. If it weren't for me, none of these people would be in this situation. You didn't do anything wrong. This is about him, not about you. I'd love to be able to believe that, but I can't. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Mr. Gorlin, I have the flight deck on hold. There's some new information I need to speak to you about first. Okay, go ahead. They've found where the suspect built the device. Now we have no confirmation, but it appears that the device might contain, a biochemical agent. -What? -JEFF: Yeah. Now are there any other precautions, they should be taking aboard the aircraft? No, a plane is a sealed environment. Listen, if that's a bio-chem bomb... [EXHALES DEEPLY] ...we have to keep it from going off. You say you have people on the site where the bomb was made? That's correct. All right, have them look for a diagram people don't build bombs like this off the top of their head, he had to be working from some kind of diagram. -It would help a lot. -If it's there, they'll find it. -Deacon may also have it on him. -JEFF: Okay. JOHN: I've secured it as well as I could. George, you did a hell of a job. Thanks a lot. -Both of you, for that matter. -I appreciate it, but I'm glad you're back. Passengers are getting anxious, I owe them an explanation. JEFF OVER PA: Oceanic 762, this Jeff Belmont. The FBI has just informed us that, Garner Chemical where Phillip Deacon works, recently reported the theft, of some test tubes filled with SX-19. We believe it's in the device. They lost SX-19? -What the hell is that? -It's a nerve gas, developed by the military. A tiny, tiny amount, a drop smaller than a pinhead will kill you. If you breathe it, it will kill you, if you get it on your skin, it'll kill you. Remember that terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway, a couple of years ago? Well, a lot of people were injured, some even died from Sarin nerve gas. SX-19 is ten times deadlier. How quickly does it act? If you breathe it, a minute. That's why he put it near ventilation. What if we were to cover it with-- with some sort of, uh, a plastic or something, something to seal it. [DANNY SIGHS] No, it's highly corrosive, it'll eat right through plastic. Listen, Captain, you cannot let the stuff get into the air system. You're going to have to shut down your air cycle machines. That'll depressurize the cabin, we won't have enough air to breathe. Well, what if we drop the oxygen masks, and descend to a breathable altitude? We'll burn up too much fuel flying at a lower altitude. Run the numbers on the fuel, Kim. We already did. If you fly anywhere below eighteen thousand feet, you won't make it to LA. I've got to talk to the passengers. The last thing I want them to do is panic. It's going to make it worse. JOHN: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Prescott again. I was hoping we were dealing with a hoax, but it looks as though we actually have an explosive device on the aircraft. [CROWD CLAMORS] -JOHN: Alan? -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] JOHN: We're in direct contact with experts on the ground who are going to help us disarm this, instrument. We're confident that we can deal with it safely. If everyone would just stay calm, and wait for further updates, that would help us a great deal. I want to thank you very much for your cooperation. Now please remain calm. John? Anne? Where are you? The Oceanic office at LAX. I'm sorry, I just had to hear your voice. They've told you what's happening? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm just trying to get home a little ahead of schedule. Should I keep the reservation tonight? JOHN: You call that restaurant, and tell them to keep that champagne on ice, all right? Have I ever missed an anniversary before? No. All right, I'll see you in a while, honey. ANNA: I'll be waiting. I love you. And I love you. Can they do that can they disarm a bomb over the phone? I don't know. I-- I'm sure, it's... it's possible but, It might still go off. Yesterday, I thought, spraining an ankle was like the worst thing that could ever happen. I know, I just keep thinking about my folks. I just want to see them again. Me, too. How's it going? Would you like another? [GLASS CLATTERS] Drink, another drink. No. Just over here, if you need anything. [OVERAPPING CHATTER] Oceanic 762, we have Phillip Deacon on the line, he wants to speak to Claire. John, with your permission, I'll patch him through. -Kim, get her. -All right. Excuse me. Claire, could I speak to you in the flight deck for a moment? KIM: Claire... [CLEARS THROAT] [EXHALES DEEPLY] ...we need your help. Phillip just called again, and he wants to talk to you. We've got him on the satellite. -No, I can't, I can't-- -Yes, Claire, listen to me. You've got to do this. He's the only one that can help us turn the device off. Now whatever he wants to hear, you tell him. Claire. There is no choice here. Okay, Jeff, we've got her. She needs to keep him on the line as long as possible. They're, they're tracing the call down in Sydney All right. He's calling from a cell phone so we're using, a satellite tracking system. Also, there's a chance, that he may be carrying the plans for the device, with him. We've got to get our hands on them. It may be our only hope. KELLY: Copy that. How long you got her? Is he still on the line? -We're on our way-- -Tanner. Deacon's on the line to Oceanic, he's in the city, let's go. You get there. JEFF: You ready, Claire? Go ahead. JEFF: Oceanic. Go ahead, sir. Hello, Claire. Hello, Phillip. I don't know what happened. Can't we, um... Claire, can't we-- can't we just-- just go back to the way we were? We could try, Phillip, we could see. No, no, no. It's too late. CLAIRE: It's not, it's not. Why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you... [SOBS] I'm afraid of you. I don't want to be afraid of you, Phillip. [SOBBING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ANNA: There are innocent people on this flight. They don't deserve this. MAN: We've got the cell down to a ten-block radius in the Klondike Beach area, and he's still on the line. CLAIRE: I'll sit down with you... and we can talk about it. I'll do anything I can to help you, Phillip. No, no, it's too late. No, it's not. It's not too late. You're just saying that because you-- you want me to tell them how to turn it off. DISPATCHER OVER RADIO: We have a probable location, a pub at 14-11, Fraser. Subject still on the line. I know the place. Yes, Phillip. I want you to tell them how to turn it off. But not for me, it's for innocent kids, their mothers, the people on this flight that have nothing to do with us. Phillip? You'd never come back to me. I don't know what I'd do, Phillip. I just know that this isn't the way. What happened to us, Claire, huh? I-- I never stopped loving you. Then let's sit down just the two of us, and we'll, we'll talk it out, huh? Let's do that. Claire? Who's that? It was him. He's with you... [CHUCKLES] ...he's listening to us. CLAIRE: No, Phillip, wait, PHILLIP: You don't care about me, you just care about him. You just want to save your precious husband, hmm. Let me handle this. Well, you're both going to die. Miss, did you see-- WOMAN: Hey! Hey, that's him! Get out of the way! Hey! Stop, police! JOHN: Danny, you with me? Loud and clear. Looks like plan B. JOHN: So, we're going to disarm a live bomb? DANNY: Won't be that hard. I'm going to walk, and talk you right through it. And you've done this before, right? DANNY: That's how I got to be a bomb expert. And I still got all my fingers. Well, that's a good sign. DANNY: That's a very good sign. Now we've already checked the top for trip wires. We didn't find any, so we're going to very slowly lift the top, and take a look inside. JOHN: All right, I'm slitting the knife into the lid again. Lifting the lid, very slowly, gently. [SIRENS BLARING] I can already see those floor seats you're going to buy me. -[♪♪♪] -[GASPS, PANTS] -What is it? -[PANTS] JOHN: It's a music box. DANNY: Well, what do you see inside? JOHN: Nothing, it's empty. -Take the back entrance. -OFFICER: Yes sir! DANNY: See if you can remove the inside casing. All right, I'm inserting the knife... into the casing. Lifting it. There's a wire attached to the underneath. Booby trap? I don't know. Um, but it's the only way into the package. -MIKE: Put your guns away -KELLY: Do it, guys! MIKE: Phillip, no one has to get hurt here, okay? Not you, not me, not anybody. Now we've got a plane load of people that have nothing to do with whatever is going on with you. -I can't help-- -Yes, you can. Yes, you can. -So cut it? -DANNY: I would. Because in about four minutes, it won't make any difference anyway. Take a step toward me, we're not going to do anything, we're just going to talk, okay? We're just going to talk. Just take one step towards me, just one step towards me, we're not going to do anything, we're just going to talk. -[SCREAMS] No. -[PHILLIP WHIMPERS] Tell us-- tell us how to disarm it. [GRUNTS] I really don't like this, you know. Tell us how to disarm it! JOHN: Preparing to cut. -MIKE: Tell us! -I can't. -[GRUNTS] -[♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [CROWD GASPS] [CROWD GASPING, INDISTINCT CHATTER] If I were dead, would I know it? No, but we would. [SIGHS] JOHN: Okay, I see it. Wire circuits, a battery. [EXHALES DEEPLY] JOHN: Okay, there's a, there's a terminal about three-quarters of an inch by an inch, and a half. Eight different screws connecting eight wires. They're different colors, there's a computer chip with a series of numbers on top. -Did you get him? -Yeah, yeah, we got him. Miss, we think he may have left something behind, did you find anything? -Well, just his cell phone. -There's nothing here. Was there-- was there anything else, anything? -Some trash. -Show me the trash. He's placed false wires to confuse anyone who might get this far. There's a circuit board with copper. Yeah, yeah, this is it. Is there more? Show me more. Yeah. KELLY: Yeah, look at this. Look at this. Wait, wait, right in the middle of all this, there's, uh, three glass tubes that are filled with, uh, -greenish-type liquid. -DANNY: That's it. Listen, whatever you do, don't-- Do not touch it. MIKE: I need a piece of paper, and some tape. Okay. This is it. DANNY: Are the wires color-coded? Yes, they're colored, I see, uh, um, red, green, blue, yellow. -[BEEPING] -KIM: What's on the weather radar? -Nothing I can see. -[SIGHS] Captain, we're hitting more turbulence, maybe you should get out of there. There's not enough time. -[BEEPING] -KIM: We've got to get out of this. All stations, all stations, Oceanic 762, east bound on Alpha, position Betty, leaving three-five-zero for three-three-zero due to turbulence. MIKE: Try this one. DANNY: What's yellow attached to? JOHN: It's attached to a copper filament that's attached to the main circuit board. Is the connection copper to copper? Yes. Go ahead and cut it. -Okay, it's cut. -DANNY: Next wire. All right, let's go with -red. Yes. -Copper to copper? Cut it. JOHN: Red's been cut. There, do you have a fax machine? -Yeah at the back. -Show me. This is Kim. Kim? We need some form of announcement. Okay, hold on. I want you to make the announcement. You're one of the most experienced pilots Oceanic has, retired or not. Would you do it? Sure, Kim. Ladies and gentlemen, uh, can I have your attention please? We don't want you to be alarmed, but we may have to drop oxygen masks. And if that does happen, we are going to ask you to, share them with your other passengers who don't have seats. We may have a fairly rapid descent, which is nothing to be alarmed about. You heard your Captain tell you that this aircraft is flying perfectly. And if we do, indeed, make a descent, it will be for safety reasons. So everyone stay cool, be considerate of your fellow passenger, and, uh, we'll all be home shortly. You have my word on that. All right, let's try blue. Uh-oh, wait a second, wait. This is connected to a-- a small screw. That's it, that's it, loosen the screw. Okay, now be careful when you go in, that the, metal from the screwdriver doesn't come in contact with any exposed wires or conduits. JOHN: All right. All right. All right it's loose, now what? DANNY: [SIGHS] Now, here comes the tricky part. The initiator should be located directly between the positive and negative conduit. It should be a small blasting cap, probably a long round cylinder. JOHN: I see it. DANNY: You have to remove it without touching either conduit. You've got to lift it out of its housing, so you can cut, the wire underneath. JOHN: All right, I see it. I see the wire. Cut it, Captain, cut that wire. Now. -[RUMBLING] -God. [PANTS] Captain? Captain? You there? [PANTS] I think I owe you some Laker tickets. [CROWD CHEERS, CHUCKLES] [EXHALES DEEPLY] Was there ever any doubt? [EXHALES DEEPLY, CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Should I do something with this thing? No, no, leave it where it is. It could still be dangerous. You just bring the plane home, and we'll take it from there. GEORGE OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, we have good news. The device has been successfully disarmed. And we anticipate no further problems. We'll be landing at LAX shortly, and we, thank you for your patience. DANNY: Captain, you still back there? Yeah, I'm still here. I'm afraid I have some bad news. We, uh, we got the diagram. There's a backup trigger, it's set to activate if the primary trigger is disabled. You're telling me this thing is still armed? [SIGHS] He set it so that it can't be turned off. It's, um, rigged to a pressure sensor that reacts to changes in the altitude. So it'll go off we try to land? Or if you just change altitudes. Could be five thousand feet, could be, sea level or anywhere in between. We have no way of knowing. If he can't get you flying, he's determined to get you landing. JOHN: Okay, folks, there's got to be something here we can do. What about blankets? What if we wet some blankets, and wrapped them around the box? That would absorb the gas. DANNY: No, no, listen, that's the, worst thing you can do keep water away from it, water acts as an accelerant. Listen, Captain... [CHUCKLES] ...we're going to have to assume this thing is going to, detonate, okay? Get as far away from it as you can, get the plane on the ground, get the people out. So there's no way to disarm this one? No. The diagram is clear, this one is fail-safe. I'm on my way back to the flight deck. You realize how fast we're going to be moving when we hit the ground? DANNY: All right, listen, I'm going to stay on the line with you. Good luck, Captain. You guys hear that? Yeah, we better get this thing on the ground. -Maggie, everybody there? -MAGGIE: We're all on, Captain. All right, I wish I could say we're out of trouble but we're not. It looks as though this thing is going to detonate as we descend for a landing. There's not going to be an explosion, here's going to be a release of a very harmful gas, Don't go near it, do not touch it. I want to prepare for an emergency landing. I want everyone off this aircraft as quickly as possible. I want to go through the two front cabin doors. You understand that? Do not by any means let anyone go near the rear of the aircraft. Good luck. I want to be down there when he comes off that plane, Jeff. Okay. I'll see to it. JOHN OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Prescott. First of all, I want to thank everyone for your composure, and your cooperation. It's been a difficult hour, and you've all done great. Unfortunately, I'm afraid we're not out of the woods yet. It seems as though the device might detonate, as we descend for landing. It will not be any type of an explosion, but there's a possibility a toxic gas will be released. The gas is visible. Do not under any circumstances come into contact with it. As soon as the aircraft is safely parked on the runway, we'll be making an emergency exit through the front doors, and the front cabin, there'll be plenty of time for your flight attendants to explain the procedure. I do not by any means want anyone going to the rear of the aircraft. If everyone follows instructions, we should be safely on the ground within minutes. Flight attendants, begin preparations. It's going to be okay. You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. You? -Actually, I'm a bit anxious. -John. -JOHN: Yeah. Nothing, I'm just glad we're almost through this. JOHN: Let's just land this plane, and get the people on the ground safely, huh. George? I knew you couldn't stay retired. [CHUCKLES] Retirement's looking better all the time. MAN OVER PA: Oceanic 762 heavy, we've got you about thirty miles out, we've cleared all other traffic, and you can descend to nine thousand feet. Oceanic, 762 heavy descending nine-zero. Nine-zero. Here we go. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So far, so good. [SIREN BLARES] MAN: Oceanic 762 heavy, turn right heading one-three-zero. Oceanic 762 heavy, turning right, one-three-zero altitude six thousand feet, and descending. [CROWD SOBS] -DANNY: Captain? -We're still here. We're going to have a hazard material team meet the plane from my calculations once the device goes, you're going to have casualties. Don't, I repeat, do not attempt to help them. Okay, once a person feels the effects of SX-19, it's already too late, do you understand? Roger that. How fast will it spread? Well, once the device goes, it'll be about ten seconds before the gas appears. Once the gas is visible, it will spread quickly. You've got to move those people through the doors. -Got it. -DANNY: Good luck. JOHN: All right, we're at 5,000 feet, and coming in. I'm going to do what I can to help the evacuation. -I'll see you on the ground. -Thanks, George. Sorry, excuse me, sorry, excuse me. Maggie, everything under control? -Is this your first emergency landing? -Yeah, yes. Important, no one hesitates at that door. If they do, you put your hand on their back, and help them out. Okay. Uh, the, uh, service elevator how long does that take to get down? I don't know, maybe five seconds. -Oh, good. -Why? -Gear down, flaps 20. -Gear down, flaps 20. God, God. [GROANS] [COUGHS, GROANS] MAGGIE: George! Yeah. Captain, the device just went off. I think George is dead. He-- he, uh, he put the device into the service elevator, I think it's gone down to the cargo hold. All right, prepare for emergency landing, Maggie. We'll be bringing her down hard, and fast. -Re-circ fans off. -KIM: Re-circ's off. The flight attendants on the lower deck will be directing you to the two exits at the front of the plane. All eyeglasses, neckties, false teeth must be removed. -What? -It's Maggie. The gas is coming down the aisle. -How fast is it spreading? -I don't know, maybe two minutes. All right, Maggie, we're gear down now. Brace yourself, get down right there quick. [SIRENS BLARE] -Fifty above, decide. -Land. Reverse now! Ladies and gentlemen, please move to the forward exit. Please move to the forward-- Remain calm. Okay, ladies, and gentlemen, can you move quickly? Are you going to be okay on that ankle? If I have to walk on my hands, I'm getting off this plane. You can lean on me if you want. No, no, no. You just get to the door, and jump on the slide. I'll be right behind. JOHN: Go, go, go! [CROWD CLAMORS] JOHN: Just get out! MAN: Go, go, go. I want you on the other side, the other side keep moving! Keep moving. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[SIRENS BLARE] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Go! -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] Go! Go. MAGGIE: Keep moving forward. Keep moving forward, ladies and gentlemen, hurry! There's no time. All right, Maggie, I want you to get in line, and get out of here. Go on. -Captain? -Move, that's an order. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Come on, we've got to get them moving. Keep moving, folks. Go sir, come on! JOHN: Kim, we got to get these people out of here, come on! KIM: Sir, you need to go. Sir, jump down. JOHN: Move, folks, move! I need you to clear this exit now. Move, everybody keep moving. Keep them moving, Maggie. Go, go! JOHN: Everybody off the plane now, go! Get them out of the plane now. Go! Now, go, go, go! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Go. -Go, go. JOHN: Go! Go. That's it, everybody's off. [ALL CHEER, APPLAUD] John! John! JOHN: Oh, Annie. Oh, God, thank God. Come on, it's time to go. -George. -JEFF: John, it's Danny Gorlin. Yeah, yeah. Captain, congratulations. By the way, I'm watching you on TV. JOHN OVER TV: All right it's okay, the plane's empty, everyone's out. JOHN OVER PHONE: I really don't think we would have made it without you, believe me. You know, yeah, I'm looking at my calendar here. The Hawks are in town next week. Yeah, yeah, they'll, they'll be good seats. DANNY: Floor seats. Oh, Captain. I, uh, I have a confession to make. JOHN: What's that? I got my games mixed up, Malone missed that free throw. [CHUCKLES] I know, it was in and out. You were doing so well, I didn't want to stop you. [CHUCKLES] I'll see you Saturday night. Right, John, let's go.
