In this world, in an unimaginably strange place... a deep forest that we could suddenly fall into... exists somewhere out there. Everything... started in this deep dense forest. CHUN Jeong-myoung EUN Won-jae SHIM Eun-kyung JIN Ji-hee KIM Kyung-ik PARK Lidia, JANG Young-nam and PARK Hee-soon Directed by YIM Phil-sung Our products are a bit unique, so young consumers love them... Hold on, I have another call. Why didn't you answer your phone? How do you feel? I'm going to the hospital today. Hae-young... I already told you. When? When did you tell me? Why are you so indifferent? I've been pregnant for four weeks. I told you a hundred times already, I'm not an irresponsible person. Then what am I? What am I doing now? If you're not irresponsible, why do I have to do everything? And do you have to go there now? Hae-young... How much farther is it? Not much farther. We're almost there. I guess it'll be hard to get out of the forest tonight. Anyway, what's your name? Young-hee. Kim Young-hee. And yours? Eun-soo. Lee Eun-soo. What kind of name is that for a guy? So, why is a young girl like you out on her own this late? Won't your Mom and Dad get mad? My sister lost her hairpin. I came out to look for it. It's a long story. Anyway, where could it be? We're almost there. Is that really your house? House of Happy Children By the way, aren't you scared to live way out here? Not at all. This place is comfortable for us. Young-hee... make sure you tell Mom before you go out to the forest. Sorry to trouble you so late. That's okay. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh my, you're injured. Anyway, welcome to our home. Is he sleepy? - Looks like it. Let me introduce our children. This is Man-bok, my eldest son. He turned thirteen this year. This is my daughter Jung-soon. She's our youngest. She's seven, but a little fragile. And this is Young-hee. You two already met. This little lady surprises us at times with her late night walks. She's twelve. Our kids are so adorable, aren't they? Yes. Excuse me... can I use your phone? My cell phone isn't working. I'm sorry, our phone got disconnected a few days ago. We've already reported it, but no one's come by yet. They'll probably be here tomorrow. Right, Man-bok? Honey, he looks exhausted. Did you prepare the room? - Everything is ready... Day One Low Battery Out of Service Range Let's eat. You must be starving. We sometimes eat like this. The kids love it. Very nice. All you need are birthday candles. Aren't you eating? We ate already. Please help yourself. Okay. Is the phone still disconnected? Well, it's still early. I was on an important call when I had the accident. My mother's state is critical, so I was rushing to her side. "Critical..." What does it mean? It means that his mother... could pass away. How could a mother pass away? She's very old and sick. It's okay. I'm not that close to my mother. Mothers are important. One day, you'll understand that some people are close to their mother, and others aren't. Mothers are important. They're the best thing in the world. Of course, having a mother is best for a child. What our Man-bok said is right, don't you agree? I'm sorry. I was out of line. I'm sorry, Man-bok. You're right. Thank you for the meal. I have to go now. Hello? Anybody here? This is crazy. I went the way you told me, but I couldn't get out of the forest. And it suddenly got dark. Since we're so deep in the forest, it gets dark quickly when it's even slightly cloudy. We should've gone with you. I'm sorry for being a burden again. Since I haven't called her, my girlfriend will have a fit. You have to help me tomorrow. It's so easy to get lost here if you're alone. So... I'd like to go with you when you go to work tomorrow. But I'm on vacation. What about you, ma'am? Don't you go to the market? I beg you. I bet it's hard to go to the market. Everyone says that. But you can get whatever you want at any time. Really? Then let's all go into town tomorrow. Sorry, but my youngest isn't well. That'll be a bit difficult. Why don't you get some rest? Will you take me back tomorrow? I'll take you. That's okay with you, right? I know the way too. I want to go. Me too. Me too. Okay, let's go together, you angels. He called us angels! Low battery Am I in the Bermuda Triangle? You're driving me crazy. Feel better? Go ahead, break it. You think I can't? - Do it! Then what? - I want out of here! What are you going to do? I can't stay here anymore. What about me? What do you want me to do?! - Be quiet. The kids might hear us. Who is it? Young-hee? Sleepwalking? Sometimes, she walks in her sleep with her eyes open. Mister... You're not even our Dad, why do you care about us? Just call me Eun-soo, I'm not that much older. Eun-soo, we're wide awake thanks to you. How about we try this? Let's count sheep. One sheep... two sheep... three sheep... four sheep... Mister... Mister? What about puppies? Puppies? You prefer puppies? One puppy... No, white puppies. White puppies? Okay. One white puppy... two white puppies... three white puppies... four white puppies... Day Two What's the matter? What's going on? Where's Mom and Dad? "We had urgent business to tend to. Look after the kids for a few days. Mom and Dad..." I need to think, so let's be quiet. Quiet! Or I'll punish you! I'm sorry, it's not your fault. I'll do it. Let's eat. Man-bok... can you take me into town, please? I can't leave my sisters. Jung-soon can't walk that far. And Young-hee has homework. If we can't go together, can you at least show me the way? Once I get to town, I'll send someone to take care of you. He seems nice. For now. Who's there? Is someone there? Does someone else live in these woods? No. I saw someone. I fell while running after him. You're going to stay with us? What about the phone? - Eun-soo. Think about it. If the phone is disconnected, who would call for help? No one will come to fix it. Where's the phone? Eun-soo... Are you going to leave us? No way. If you try to get out of the forest, it'll just get deeper. Was it too deep? If I follow your directions... I'll be able to leave here? You should have marked your way with breadcrumbs. Mom and Dad went far away. Very far away. They went to the hospital because Mom's sick. There's no hospital around here. They were right to go. Then this would all make sense. Don't touch our stuff. What are you doing here? There's someone up there. What? I'm sure I saw someone. Look, nobody's here. Someone was definitely in here. You chicken. Man-bok. Please help me. I have to get out tomorrow. How? It's a present. You seem... to miss your Mom very much. The Way Out The Way Out Day Three No, you can't go there. Are you coming from the town? Is there a faster way? You can't go. It's snowing too much. We're both lost. Our car broke down on the highway. Don't go that way. I heard there's a house over there. We need shelter. How did you find out about the house? He told me. He said he lives over there. Go back the way you came. Don't go, Uncle! What's the matter with him? Where are your parents? They left for a few days. So you're all alone in this house. They belong to you? We have lots of them. Really? So you must have... a pumpkin coach and a pair of glass slippers somewhere? Kids shouldn't play with expensive trinkets. Little girl, your necklace is very pretty. It keeps snowing. Your uncle must have lost his way. If you don't listen to me, I'll punish you really bad. I'll rip all your guts out. You'll hate that, right? Then die... Die! Go ahead and die! Don't go. Don't go... Uncle! Stop playing with me! Why won't you let me go? Don't yell. It's scary. Go lie down. You're wet. This is yours, right? Where did you find it? All this was due to His will. Your coming home is His will. Forgive me. I'm Deacon Byun. The kids said your name is Eun-soo? Your great Holiness In my soul... The snow... keeps falling... on my desperate hope... Day Four The snow... keeps falling. You made all this food yourselves? Who taught you to cook? Feed me. You're not a baby. Do it yourself. Please feed me. I told you already: do it yourself, you're old enough. It hurts. Your Mom and Dad spoiled you too much. That's enough. Our angels did nothing wrong. Children, calm down. Tomorrow is Christmas day. Santa Claus will grant the wishes of all good children. We can feel Christmas in the air during this long holiday! Why does everybody like Christmas? Because Santa Claus grants all the children's wishes. I want a magic box that will give me whatever I want. I want sweet cakes, candy, chocolates, robots... I want every toy in the world! Did you throw that, Young-hee? Is your Uncle sick? Yes, I think he has a cold. Is that right? There's a stain. You scared me. What are you doing here? I can see they've been alone for quite a while. I just feel bad for them. Stop... You can't take anything from here. Not going anywhere? It's still snowing outside? Hansel and Gretel "Once upon a time, in the thick deep forest..." Did you touch my stuff again? This old book matters to you? Give it! Give it to me now! Son of a bitch... What did you say to me? Let go! Let's go out and make a snowman. Please don't make him mad. Forgive me. I beg you. Please forgive me. Who are you? Please forgive me. Forgive me... What happened to you? Be quiet. We'll be in big trouble if they hear us. And I'm not their mother. What do you mean? A long time ago, our car broke down on the highway. We were looking for help... and we met Jung-soon in the forest. You can't... You can't get out of here. Don't tell... Please don't tell the children. But... what the hell are they? They... They took my husband away. I don't know where he is. After sundown... I decided to hide here. This attic is a real maze, like the forest. Look. Useless... It's useless. There's no way to get back. That child. He's here. Mom? Where are you? We have to get out of here. Please help me. Day Five So... where did it go? Did you see my ring? Did you take it for a toy? I don't know where it is. Come on, tell the truth. You have lots of jewels. Our Lord doesn't like angels who lie. Words don't seem to get through to you... This lady is annoying! Man-bok, she's not right! I can't stand her! Calm down. Don't interfere, get some fresh air. I'll find my ring. Out. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. What did you just say? You're annoying! Leave them alone. You took my ring! You make me sick. What did you just say? You little brat, what are you staring at? All orphan kids are brats. So you all better... Man-bok, stop it! Man-bok! They're all devils. You lost your temper first. Actually, it was funny. I told you what he did to me. Don't you believe me? Be patient. The Lord finally answered my prayer. This house... is evil. We should go. Calm down. In this forest, there's nothing but a lost sheep and three children. Thank you for hugging Jung-soon. Young-hee... What's going on in this house? You can tell me, right? It tickles. I have to go now. Really. You hate us that much? Why do you always want to leave? Can't you just stay with us? Young-hee... What are you doing? She hit me. I hate her. Don't you? Where are you? The Final Day Young-hee! - Hurry, Jung-soon! Hurry! Eun-soo, play with us, okay? Play with us. Play with us! How? I love listening to stories. Me too. All stories have a happy ending. And the main characters get their wish. Tell us one of your stories. Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Now listen carefully. Once upon a time... a Queen lived in her castle. She had a very cute son. But her husband the King passed away when the Prince was just a baby. The King shouldn't die so soon. I'm sure he went to a good place. Like... Like Heaven. Heaven is a place like this. Probably. Then what happened? So... the King went to Heaven, and his Kingdom was ruined. So the Queen sent her son... to a place filled with children. This place was called.... It was called... "The Palace of Angels." So all the children had wings there? But... the Master of the Palace didn't like little angels. He punished them without reason. He was a real scary man. But... why didn't the Queen... come back for her son? She did come back... but the little boy wasn't the same. He couldn't forgive his mother for abandoning him. After he grew up, he left his palace and met the Princess of another Kingdom. And they lived happily ever after, right? No. Because a baby was growing in the belly of the Princess. The day the Prince found out, he also learned that his mother was dying. So he passed by a thick forest to go visit her. But... his coach overturned along the way. A fairy came near the fallen Prince. And she took the injured Prince to her own castle. A magical castle... that kept him prisoner. And... the fairies didn't want him... didn't want him to leave... right? If the Prince... didn't leave the castle to see his Princess... their baby could die. And he wouldn't see his mother either. With their imagination, the fairies could do anything... and the Prince was already in love with them. So he stayed with them and they all lived happily ever after. The End. Isn't that right, Uncle? I found it over there. But the Prince discovered a scary secret about the fairies... They weren't all that nice. When the Prince tried to leave the castle, they got mad. So they chopped off his arms and legs... like that! Have you seen Kyung-sook? The lady who was with me. She's disappeared with some valuable things. She'll be back soon. It's hard to find your way out of these woods. And the snow hasn't melted yet. In your story... what happened next? I don't know. I don't remember. Look here, Uncle. I have to find my lost sheep. Will you come with me? Where the hell is she? Uncle... stop fooling around. This is no joke. I swear she was here. This house is quite amazing. Just when I get bored, I come across interesting things. I just thought of something. I should turn this house into a church for our Lord. And I could be His Deacon... You'll regret this. Your wife didn't run away. There's something evil in this house. We could all rot in here forever. Do you understand? You shouldn't be so familiar with me, boy. So then, you mean those children are hiding something? Listen. Children and devils are raised the same. If the little angels disrupt our Lord's worship, I'll just send them back home... In Heaven. What are you? Bastard! I asked you to show me respect! I'm merciless with anyone who interferes in my Lord's business. Understood... my lost young sheep? When did you start living here? A long time ago. A long time? How long? Since you were born? By the way, I think that... your parents are very good people. How did they manage to build this huge splendid house deep in the forest? This is very special. So what I mean is, if your parents could afford to build this house, they must have left you a lot of valuable things? They've been gone for so long, they must have left you enough money to buy food and give offerings to the Church? We don't need that stuff. We get everything we want by using our imagination. You're absolutely right. Our angels can imagine whatever they need. I'll take care of you from now on, okay? A life without parents... Don't listen to him. You're always trying to leave us! He'll protect us, he promised. No, you can't trust him. Uncle, what are you doing? Why are you so worried? Your mother in the attic and this man's wife... what did you do to them? Our Mom isn't here, but she'll be back soon. She promised me. We did nothing wrong, Uncle. We're not bad kids. That's enough. Don't blame these children without any proof. Our angels can do no harm. Uncle shouldn't blame our innocent angels. Isn't that right, Jung-soon? We made it. Is it good? Very good. No, it's impossible... They're just kids. Help me... Help me? Waiting for Mom and Dad Our new parents are on their way... New parents? Was it fun? Girls! Cut it out. Help her! She's bleeding. I'm suffering too. Sooner or later, someone will come by here. Let's wait a bit longer. You keep saying that. How long do we have to wait? I'm going crazy, I can't take it anymore! Just a little longer. Until when? Forever? Until we both die? Even then, I didn't want to show them my gift. They would have been too scared. Go out again today. When we get out of here, we're through. Fine. No matter how many times I try, it's useless... Should I just burn down the forest? What do you think, Man-bok? Of course, you don't know the way out. You'll get lost and come back crying... crying that you miss your mommy! Don't talk about my mother! "Mommy..." Shut up! Let go! I told you not to talk about her! Let me go! Are you doing it on purpose? Man-bok, I can't stand it anymore. Are you crazy? I can't control my hand. Man-bok, what shall we do? She knows. Mom and Dad, you'll stop fighting now, right? I didn't say anything. Don't come any closer! Don't raise your voice. Young-hee thinks this is all a dream. Try it on. I wish she could be my doll. The biggest, prettiest doll in the entire world. Good girl. My baby... You're so cute. Let me give you a hug. Stay with me... forever. The third path on the right... Then left... Another left... Eun-soo... Don't I look pretty? Why won't you hug me? Young-hee... you're perfect the way you are. Eun-soo... please hug me tight. What's wrong with you? Sometimes I have a very scary dream. A terrible dream... He keeps saying that I'm pretty. Did something bad happen? Did someone hurt you? Why do you always want to leave? I like you. We're not bad kids. And... you've already become the hero of our story. What? Didn't you come here to find the book? In this place, all our wishes will come true if we imagine them with all our heart. That's why... I removed all the mirrors in here. It only happens in this room. Someone's singing. 1971 - House of Happy Children I praise Your Greatness and sing with the angels... I will now carry out Your will. Amen. Little Unit - CHO Kyung-ran KIM Man-bok, born on 19/3/1959 KIM Young-hee, born on 8/6/1960 KIM Jung-soon, born on 20/11/1965 Is it in there? Man-bok, big brother. Tell me... Where is the deed to this house? Don't touch that. And free Jung-soon! You're scaring me. Big brother Man-bok has scary eyes. Tell me... Where did your parents really go? Did that stupid Uncle get rid of them? Or... did you do something to them? When I was young, I sent my Dad to Heaven, you see. He was annoying me too much. Man-bok, did you hurt your parents... like me? You're all the same. I'm sick of it. Man-bok, this is a bad man. He promised to protect us... Why are all grown-ups so bad? Man-bok! What are you? Are you Satan? Satan, leave this house. Lord, is that why I'm here? To retrieve Your Home from these demon children? Lord... I will retrieve Your home. Stop it! I don't want you to get hurt! Man-bok, stop it! You'll be like him if you do this! Why? Why should I spare him? He's a bad grown-up! Bad grown-ups must be punished! Not like this. There has to be another way. The bad witch got punished! That's... That's a fairy tale. No. This book granted... all our wishes. Who the hell are you? What happened in this house? We... We've lived here... for a very long time. House of Happy Children Father, I was wrong. Please forgive me. Father, forgive me. Please stop! Father, I beg you! Forgive me. Stop. Father... Father. No! Father! Why did they send you back this time? Did your sleepwalking scare them? Or... did you miss this place? Father! I'm the prettiest one. I'm much prettier than Jung-soon. She's too small and skinny. Please, take me instead, Father. All right? Little lady, it's Christmas tomorrow. Why do you like Christmas? Because on that day, Santa Claus grants all the children's wishes... Man-bok... is it true that Santa Claus grants... the wishes of all children? I don't know. I don't know, Jung-soon. But... why hasn't he come here to grant our wishes? I think... Heaven is too far from here. I hope he comes this year. Were you good? Yes, I was very good. It's not true! I was more obedient! Man-bok. Jung-soon. Time to wake up. You angels... Come here. They're still sleepy. You take good care of them, you make them take naps. Are these all of the children? No, they're the youngest. The older kids are in school. This boy came here when he was five. He got beaten by his father so he's a bit sullen. Oh, goodness... I do my best for him, but it's not easy. Children are always influenced by grown-ups. These two are sisters. They look alike. They'll be so pretty when they grow older. Of course, they look like angels. The youngest isn't very strong, I worry about her. So you have something ready for us? Children, Santa Claus is here. He came a very long way to see you. Look. It looks delicious. Good. Try this one. You have one too. Good? Sweet, isn't it? This is for the little lady. And this... is a special Christmas gift from Santa Claus. Hansel and Gretel Next year, I'll bring more books. Mister, you're the real Santa Claus, right? You're really Santa? You're going to grant all our wishes for Christmas, right? Of course. If you were good children, all your wishes will be granted. Santa Claus... we're not bad children. I know that. Children, I'll tell you a little secret. From now on... just imagine whatever you want, and your wish will be granted. You can get everything you need this way. We just have to imagine it? Everything we want? Of course. Help me, Help me, I'm hungry. Help me... I'm hungry. Seung-ho... Man-bok, why isn't he moving? Hyung-joon. Eat some of this. Santa Claus gave it to us. Hyung-joon, wake up. Wake up! Your almighty and great Holiness praises my soul Your almighty grace... If you didn't exist, those sweets would be for me. You're a bad man. - Not true. Uncle is the bad one. He wants to leave, and you all know it. Right? I'll protect you forever. No! Forever. Man-bok! I'll stay by your side. He's lying... He's lying! How dare you stare me down? Shut up, you bastard. Man-bok. Eun-soo's right. This man... is like the Father at the orphanage. If we imagine it... everything is possible. All our wishes will come true at Christmastime. Do you remember? Shut up, children of Satan! Punish him! Hurry! What are you doing? I'll burn you all in Hell! Man-bok... We'll be happy from now on, right? Eun-soo... stay with us. Forever, okay? You have to end this curse and leave this house. I'll help you. You'll make new friends, become grown-ups... We hate grown-ups! Or you'll become like the bad grown-ups. No. We're different. I thought you'd be different, but I was wrong. As soon as we start loving grown-ups, they try to leave us. Just try to get out of the forest. Listen. You have to leave too. You could be happy! What's it like in your world? Are all the children happy there? Being Happy Forever with Uncle The children and Uncle lived happily ever after. And... you've already become the hero of our story. Our story ends here. I've already decided. People are waiting for me. I'm sure you know how sad and painful it is to be separated... from those you love. No one loves us. They all try to leave us. We thought you were different. We thought you really liked us. Young-hee... let's get out of here. Why do you keep wanting to leave? We have everything here... if we just imagine it. I told you. The baby Prince will be born soon. He'll need me. What about us? Who's going to take care of us? We need you. Forever. I lived my life... thinking I was the most miserable man in the world. I always tried to run away. But now... I've changed. We're not bad children. But everybody... thinks that we are. And you... do you believe it too? Do you? Eun-soo. Sorry... I'm really sorry. What for? For all of this. You're going to take care of us, right? You're going to stay with us? Let's leave together. You have to try. No. We can't leave this place. This is our home. I like you very much. When you hug me, I feel safe. Thank you. I'm sorry. Young-hee... I'm sorry. I miss her... Hae-young... I miss her. Burn the notebook. The book of our story. Hurry. What are you doing? Burn it. Erase yourself from our memories and our imagination. What are you doing? You have to take care of us! Bye. Bye. Are you the crash victim? How did your car end up over there? And where have you been? This is so weird. Are you hurt? Over here, Chief! Shuffle over, old man... Wait a minute. Let's finish up and go, okay? Will you go buy some powdered milk? I love you. I'm going to sleep. If it was just a dream... why do I love these children so much? I still don't know... where I really was.
