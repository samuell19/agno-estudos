First, you need to know something about them. The beautiful ones. The flawless four. Everyone wanted to be them. You know them. They went to your school too. They totally ruled. The one in green, that's Courtney. She was the leader. She was like Satan in heels. The blonde, Marcie Fox, a legend in her own little mind. Known to herself as Foxy. The one with the pigtails is Julie, popular because of that face... ...and because she was best friends with the one in the pink. That's Liz Purr. She was special. Everybody loved Liz... ...not just because she was beautiful and popular and rich and smart. She was all of those things, but more than anything... ...she was sweet. Courtney ruled with terror, but Liz ruled with kindness. She was like the Princess Di of Reagan High... ...and that pissed Courtney off. Liz Purr was just.... Well, she was perfect. I used to dream about what it would be like to be her... ...Elizabeth Purr. It's a shame about what happened to Liz. That was no way to wake up on your 1 7th birthday. She is gonna die! -lt's much better than last year. -l wish my friends did that for me. Yeah, right. You'd have us killed. Only maimed, my dear. What're we gonna do? We'll stuff her pretty face with pancakes... ...tie her to the flagpole in her undies and watch the fun begin. She is gonna die! Polaroid. Hey, birthday girl, rise and shine! -Who's doing the honours? -Me. Aren't we anxious? One is for witch... ...two is for bitch.... Pop it, Marcie! Surprise! Oh, my God. What happened? What's in her throat? Courtney? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is a joke, right? lt's a total joke. Say it's a joke. lt was supposed to be for fun. -This isn't happening. -l didn't want her to scream. Oh, God. Oh, God, Liz! l thought a jawbreaker was funny. You gagged her with a jawbreaker? Call someone right now. -No way. -Why not? lt was an accident. Oh, my God, did you hear that? -l think l'm gonna be sick. -Sick? That's it. Liz is sick. She is dead. Does school know that? You cannot just call in sick for her. We have to tell somebody. Liz is-- Dead. Liz is dead. Do you have any idea what that means? You'll be prom queen? That is so not funny. Our best friend is dead. People won't be pleased. But they'll understand. No. You understand. l am not getting fucked... ...because l played a clever prank for my friend's birthday. Give me the phone. Okay, who's got the motherly voice? No way! l want nothing to do with this. Ms. Sherwood, please. Hi, Ms. Sherwood, this is Mrs. Purr, Elizabeth's mother. l'm sorry, but Elizabeth won't be in school today. l know, she's had a lot of absences... ...but the poor dear woke up with a blistering fever. Can you send one of her friends with her assignments? Thank you ever so much. Have a nice day. Bye. That was really good. What do you mean? The way you imitated Liz's mom. l'm just saying you're in control. l know. Reality check. Liz is in the trunk of this car, and she is dead. That is a sad, fucked up thing. But you will walk into that school and strut your shit down the hallway... ...like everything is peachy fucking keen. Get it? Julie? Whatever. All right, bitches, out. Move it, move it! That means you too, gusher. Come on. Hi, Fern. No, no, no, space cadet. Drinking fountain down the hall. l don't think l can do this. lt's just a day like any other day. What would we do on any other day? Pre-lunch touchups? That's right, Marcie. Take a long, hard look in the mirror, girls. lt's beauty time. Hello, girls. Having a smoke? A toke? Some dope? No loitering in the girl's room. Trouble brews in this room. Not so fast. Elizabeth is out today. Which one of you will stop by my office to pick up her assignments? -Miss Shane? -With pleasure. Excellent. Make it by three. l have a pet to groom. And Miss Shane... ...please cover your bosoms. This is a learning institution, not a brothel. Do it yourself. Be nice, girls. '' Be nice, girls.'' Nice is not enough. lf l was friends with everyone because they're nice... ...l'd have Noah's fucking Ark in my phone book. Remember, everything is peachy keen. Peachy fucking keen. l know this a bit out of our realm of comprehension. The delusion, the derangement, the descent into madness. She says it herself, ''What's done cannot be undone.'' l know this may be hard to understand. lt's not like your lives today, what with your acne mask and corn dogs. Planet head. lt's nothing to laugh about. There was nothing fun and fancy free for Shakespeare's tragic characters. In the Dark Ages... ...knowledge of female anatomy... ...was divulged through autopsy... ...and execution. -Women deemed... -Hey, baby. ...criminal or demented were put to death... ...both on and off their menstrual flow. Then we crack the egg... ...ever so gently, but with ample force. Cool, you got a stillborn. Oh, nasty. Put her back in bed. We can't put her back in bed. -Why not? -She's got a jawbreaker in her throat. We can get it out. l've got eyelash curlers. Perfect. She was up late, watching TV, sucking on a jawbreaker. Maybe she was practicing, if you know what l mean, and swallowed. Wait a minute. Rape. They'll check to see if she was raped. Maybe Liz had a friend over. Mummy and Daddy's last night away. Maybe he's from school, maybe not. But definitely into kink. He got a little rough, went too far. There's a fine line between pleasure and pain. She screamed for help, but her screams were muffled by the huge candy ball. She tried... ...but there was nothing. Only sugary, sweet death. Oh, my God. That, like, totally gave me the chills. Nobody's gonna believe that. There is no proof. They will because it's their worst nightmare. Liz, the very picture of teenage perfection, obliterated by perversion? You are sick, Courtney. Shit! l was supposed to pick up Liz's homework. What if Ms. Sherwood took it? We kill her. Did you see her face? lt doesn't matter that l have to get there. Ms. Sherwood? Hello, Fern. l wanted to know if you were gonna chaperone... ...the botany club's garden party. Yes, l am. Of course, l wouldn't miss that for the world. You know, Fern, do you know a senior named Elizabeth Purr? You mean the meow? Excuse me? Liz is the cat's meow. l'm sure she is. ln any case, the poor thing is sick with the flu. Somebody has to take her her assignments and Miss Shane-- l could do it. You will? lt'd be an honour. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. l didn't give her the address. Ms. Sherwood, wait! Miss Shane. l forgot to pick up Liz's homework. Yes, you were tardy. But, thankfully, Fern Mayo stopped by my office. She's on her way. Mayonnaise? Liz hates her. Hate is a very ugly word, Miss Fox. Fern Mayo is a dependable young woman. She may not be pretty like you, but she gives as well as receives. We could learn a thing or two from the Fern Mayos, couldn't we? We have to get there before Mayo. That is no 1 05 pounds. God, she's so stiff. No more aerobics for this girl. Panties on or off? Rip them. Let's see. lf l were being choked, l'd claw the sheets to smithereens. -Should we shred them? -No time. Hi, Liz. My name's Fern Mayo. Like hold the mayo? You don't know me... ...but l know you. Help me get her legs. What're you doing to me? -Oh, my God. -What're you doing to me? l'm so sorry. lt's from last year's prank. lt's one of those cards. You push a button, record a greeting. -You open it-- -What're you doing to me? Oh, my God. Stop it! lt's like she's in here with us. Alive. Let's just do this and get out. l love your hair. l love the way it shines. She looked at me. l swear to God, she looked at me. Her eyes are open. She has to look somewhere. My God, Marcie, she's dead. Relax. How's that? -Very natural. -Thank you. Jules? l need your seal of approval here. Now come over here and check it out. -Does it look real? -l can't do this. No! Did you hear that? You're being paranoid. Will you relax? l killed Liz, the teen dream. Deal with it. l have to get out of here. What? What's wrong? You don't understand. l'm not doing this. l don't want anything to do with this. lt's a little late for that. Please l want to go to the police, tell them it was an accident. We didn't mean to kill her. The police will come when her parents find her. She was raped. You can't just say that because she's in bed with her legs spread. l can't believe this! l am looking after us. l am saving your ass, and you shit on me. Go to hell, Courtney. You're Fern Mayo, right? l'm Courtney. l don't think we've met... ...what with the cruel politics of high school. -May l introduce Marcie Fox? -Foxy. Fern, l need you to be completely honest with us. And l know you will be, because you're an honest kind of gal. Tell us, did you hear anything? And let's not lie. l have this gift. l can smell a lie. Leave her alone, Courtney. Fern is a big girl, Julie. She can speak for herself. Fern, come on, l'm gonna take you home. Homework. l was sent with Liz's homework. lsn't that nice? And you heard us? No one's gonna hurt you. l don't know. She doesn't know. We're all girlfriends here. lt's just between us. What do you know? She doesn't know anything. Come on, Fern. Say what you heard. Come on, Fern. What did you hear? Get her! Let her go. -Have a little scare, dear? -Boo! l'll come clean because once our boo-boo floats to the surface... ...it'll all become clear in that little head of yours, anyway. And we wouldn't want you to do anything rash, would we? You knew Liz Purr, right? l know of her. Knew of her. Past tense. She's dead, Fern. She died. But we've got a bit of a problem because you know we did it. You heard us. That gives you a little something called power. The power to tell. And you're the kind of girl that tells. A tattletale. A rat. l know you. l know all about you. You're the one that the geeks won't dance with... ...because they're at home fucking old pervs in cyberspace. There's nothing to hide, Fern. You're nothing. We're everything. You're the shadow, we're the sun. But l'm here to offer you something you never dreamed of. Something that you were never meant to be, but will be. Because today, my dear... ...fate has decided that you are cool. We're gonna make you... ...one of us. Beautiful, popular... ...loved, feared. All you've ever dreamed of. lf, and only if... ...you never, ever tell anyone what you heard. Think of it. This is sick, Courtney. You don't own someone by making them beautiful. A makeover can't hide the truth. Liz is gone, Fern. Take her place. You know you want it. Think about boys. Think about prom. They'll be lining up for you. -Not with oil. -But with drive. -Watch the eyes come alive. -You as us. A dash of magenta. Lashes bold, black. X-rated gloss. -Hair frames the portrait. -Some gilded. -Colour, the secret to not growing old. -We cut, layer and curl. -For a look that is you. -For the hair of a dead girl. -Lips full and dark. -Lush. A fine line that traces a deep, crimson heart. Rest now, sweetness. The beauty we molded... ... from sheer misery. Elizabeth! Honey, we're home. Stand straight. -Stop shaking. -l'm sorry. l still can't get over myself. Oh, fresh meat! To think, my 2nd-grade teacher said l had no artistic potential. lt's like a dream. l made you and l'm God. That's all you need to know. Oh, my God, Julie is sitting with the body-art rejects. -ls she tweaking? -lt's a beautiful thing. To make someone fall so far, so fast. Look what the kitty dragged in. You look really great, Fern. Thank you. l thought you should know that Liz's parents came home. So? We should tell someone what happened. There's nothing to tell. l made cocksure of that. What does that mean? Girls, why don't you run ahead? Listen, bitch, one word and you're over. l mean that. l'm not scared of you anymore. We saw you. We all know you did it. -No one will ever believe you. -Ask Fern. Ask Marcie. We saw everything. Fucking liar! One word and you perish. l promise you that. Toodles! What are you doing? God! Tuna munch? But my mom always-- We never eat at lunch. Do you understand me? For some damn good reason we did... ...we would never, ever eat out of a brown paper bag. l don't care if there's a culinary masterpiece in it. Get rid of it. Sorry. -lf l get a zit because of this-- -l'm sorry. l'd better never have kids. l have zero patience. Don't think we're anorexic, we're not. That's for the Karen Carpenter table. We're not stupid. We eat. And we eat well. We just don't eat in public. We don't want people judging us by what we eat. lt gives them ammo. The only ones with ammo are us. Food's cool. You need it to live. But the mere act of eating invokes thoughts of digestion... ...flatulation, defecation... ...even, shall we say, complexion defection. l'd never eat a greasy pizza. Not even in front of the ultra-special students... ...because they're associating that greasy pizza with your shiny face. A zit, a blackhead, a cluster of pores. lt's just another vexing stress. Life is hard enough without added anxiety. So, are introductions in order? -Dane, this is-- -Vylette. Pretty name. -You're a transfer? -Dane, let's not perplex her. She's had a trying morning with the trauma of changing schools. Reagan's a whole new battlefield, and we were on the subject of... ...strategy. But come by a little later. l don't know about you, but l could do with some kink. You got it, baby. -Nice meeting you-- -Vylette. Yeah, that. See you, Foxy. Sit on it, Dane. Vylette? l like it. Thinking on your toes, a must if you're going to rule the school. l was thinking, Fern. lt's a plant, right? l don't know about you, but l would much rather be a flower. A rose? Too obvious. Never send a rose unless dyed black as a warning. And if one is sent to you... ...destroy it and the sender. Emotionally, of course. lt's not like we kill people. On purpose. Anyway... ...you're extra fancy. You're Vylette. My Vylette. May l help you? l'm Detective Vera Cruz. l need some information about Elizabeth Purr. Oh, my. Julie! What are you doing waiting for the bus? -Don't ask. -What happened to your friends? l don't want to talk about it, Zach. Well, can l give you a lift? -Cool car. -Thanks. You shined today. You've got the look, the walk. But popularity is fleeting. Trends change. lt's all about details. Pay attention to details. Look at my nails. ln junior high, l wore only pink. Now it makes me puke. So l change. Demented. Seriously, the colour's called Demented. Mine? Decayed. Like Julie. Our friendship with her is decayed. -Julie is over. -Done and void. -ln two weeks, no one will know her. -lncluding you. -From now on, you don't know her. -Never knew her. She's like Fern Mayo. A bad dream. Get it? Well, thanks for the lift. lt's no problem. So do you wanna, maybe, call me sometime? l would love to. Well, bye. Mayo, please. lt's a residence. Hi, it's me, Julie. Hi, Julie. l know you're not supposed to talk to me. No, no. lt's okay. -This must be really weird for you. -Yeah. l mean, knowing about what happened to Liz... ...and everything else. Do you remember 4th grade? -Fourth grade? -Yeah, we used to have sleepovers. Remember my Holly Hobbie oven? Your parents wouldn't let you have one. They were afraid of electrocution. We used to bake cakes together. God, they were the worst cakes. l'm scared, Fern. I'm really scared. lt's just weird how time erases things. Time doesn't erase things. People do that. People erase people. Can you hold on for a second? Never answer after one ring. What were you thinking, Vylette? Are you on the other line? -No. -Good. When l call, you listen. Even if your sister locks herself in the freezer, Courtney is priority one. Get it? l brought you something sweet. -What is it? -lt's called a Big Stick. A Big Stick? You want it? l want you. And l want you to suck the Big Stick. God, you are sick. l said l could do with a little kink. Now suck it and see or get the hell out. Do you like it? lt's okay. There's nothing kinky about ''okay,'' now, is there? Now l said, do you like it? Yeah, l like it. You're good at that. l'm good at many things. That's right. You are on the wrestling team. Hey, fuck you. Now, right about now, l could get really hot. And l mean... ...hot. You know what l like to do when l get hot? Oh, yeah, baby. l want to, Dane. l want to real bad. The problem is l forgot how. What? But if you could just show me.... How's that? That's good. l better get that. Don't go. Don't come. Are you Courtney Shane? Maybe. Dad, don't be a dick. What did you say? Another lecture on the ugliness of profanity? l just wish you could hear yourself. You sound uneducated. -Dad. -And you know what? lt reflects on your parents. Parent. That's right. l'm the mom and the dad. Whatever. l watched Oprah today. That's the mom in you. You know the topic? '' Club Kids''? No, it was '' ls Your Child a Follower?'' -l'm done. Can l go? -And you know what? l was deeply concerned because, yes, my child is a follower. You are so lame. You don't even have any friends. Whatever happened to my sweet little Brownie? My Girl Scout? You remember the Tiffany concert? You loved Tiffany. I think we're alone now Oh, my God. It doesn't seem to be anyone around Thank God! Nice to meet you, Courtney. l'm Detective Cruz. You can call me Vera. Okay. Vera. So you're Liz's best bud? -You went to school that day? -Of course. -Did you try calling her? -Why? Your friend is not at school. Depends. Let me ask you this. Did you call in sick for Liz? -Did l what? -Did you call in sick for Liz? Of course not. Did it shock you? -Her death. -Not personally. Getting used to the idea? l guess you could say that. Do you know who was with Liz that night? Come on, who was the lucky guy? What? -Who was she fucking? -No one. Seen one of these before? Take a lot of licks to get one of these down. Wanna give it a whirl? No, thank you. lt's hard. Like a rock. T minus ten, nine, eight.... Jawbreaker. The name says it all. It'll break yourjaw. Fucked up name for candy, don't you think? Good morning, Reagan High. It is with deep dismay and sincere regret... ... that I inform you that Elizabeth Purr... ...a well-known senior at Reagan High School... ... was found dead in her home... ...apparently suffering from acute asphyxiation. There will be a memorial service held for Elizabeth... ... tomorrow at two o'clock at Cloverdale Lawn Rest Home. And students... ...Mr. Murk, our guidance counselor, will be available... ... for those of you suffering from distress. My thoughts are with you. Tragic. A beautiful, charismatic girl like Elizabeth Purr... ...struck down by fate. l still can't believe it. You said her mama called in sick for her. Yes, sick. She said Elizabeth had the flu. Her mama didn't make that call. Oh, no. lt could have been anybody. lt could've been a sex-crazed maniac. lf l had anything to do with her demise, l don't know what l'll do. lt'll be all right. A neighbour said she saw... ...a girl with schoolbooks come up to the house at 3:30 that day. Yes. Miss Shane. l sent Miss Shane home with her assignments. Was it Courtney Shane? Yes. No. Miss Shane was tardy, as usual... ...and Fern Mayo was in my office, so l sent her with the assignments. She is such a nice girl. -Mayo? -Yes. ls that M-A-Y-O? Fern Mayo. Come to think of it, Miss Mayo has been absent for several days. You don't think that Miss Mayo could have.... No. Miss Mayo is as sweet as the days are long. lt's a crazy world, Ms. Sherwood. Some of the sweetest candies are as sour as death inside. Hey! You're Vylette, right? l'm Brenda, Chad's girlfriend. l don't think we've met. Oh, God, l just love your hair! We heard you were the last person to see Liz Purr alive. That is so cool! Well, bye. -Oh, look, you have groupies. -l know. Aren't they cute? -Now about boys. You need one. -Only one? One to start. We don't want to baffle her. So what turns you on? Marcie likes a nice... ...round ass, don't you, Marcie? Good morning, Vera. Miss Shane. l like cheekbones. You know, a boy with a little Bowie going on. What do you like? l've always been partial to-- Darling, spare us the details. Meet your teen dream. Vylette, this is Zach Tartak. -That's him? -You don't think he's cute? Most girls go crazy over him. He's in drama so we can't guarantee hetero status. lt doesn't matter. He is beyond fine. -Ultra-pretty. -Unapproachable. Always in rehearsal. When he's not, he's with the drama crowd. Can you say... ...''freak''? The sure way to meet him is to star in the school play. Relax. lt's high school, not Broadway. Do you smell something? Hi, Fern. l don't know a Fern. There is no Fern. lt's Vylette. My name's Vylette. -Learn it. -Live it. Love it. Ladies. -Sorry l'm late. -lt's okay. This just hasn't been my day. lf you want to be alone tonight, l understand. That's what l would want. No, it's okay. Liz was the only one that meant anything to me. With Courtney and Marcie it was all games. lt was total bullshit. lmagine what it looked like from the outside. God! lt was a total sideshow, Zach. You ever get the feeling that this is one of those things... ...that shouldn't happen? What do you mean? You were the kind of girl... ...that didn't give the time of day to anybody. But when l saw you that day waiting for the bus, it was like l knew. You were alone and weren't with them anymore. l mean, l would've never thought to approach you. l've seen you. l've seen you see me. l wouldn't have gone there. No way. Why not? l mean, l liked you. l want to show you something. Come on. lt's so beautiful up here. This is where l come when l don't want anyone to find me. Now l can find you. -lt's hard to track you down, Fern. -Vylette. My name's Vylette. Fern was a childhood name... ...but now, as a senior, Vylette seems more appropriate. Can we keep that between us? Of course. Now, Ms. Sherwood says you took Liz's assignments to her home. Would you tell me about that? Liz and l never officially met. Well, we kind of met. I had a term paper due. And I was late for class. It was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. So you two became friends? We had a class together. Algebra. l sat behind her. She's got this shiny hair, you know? It smells like apples. I'd sit there, staring at her from behind. She has this cluster of beauty marks on the back of her neck. I know this sounds weird... ...but they were in the most fascinating patterns. Like a puzzle waiting to be solved, a Rubik's cube... ...an uncharted constellation. So that's what l'd do. l'd stare at the back of her neck... ...playing connect-the-dots. I've found salmon swimming upstream on the back of that neck. Spider webs... ...sea monkeys even. And the bell would ring... ...and she'd be the first one out. And l'd be stuck there, sitting with all these... ...salmon and sea monkeys dancing in my head. Very interesting. So l guess Liz was a hero to you? l mean, wouldn't it bother you to lose such a close friend? This is high school, Detective Cruz. What is a friend, anyway? A friend is someone who tells the truth no matter what. A true friend never lies. Look. Liz was sweet. l did her a favour. Can l go now, please? Sure, Vylette. This is high school, Detective Cruz. What is a friend, anyway? Liz is the cat's meow. Meow! I killed Liz. I killed the teen dream. Deal with it. We're gonna make you one of us. You're Vylette. My Vylette. A friend is someone who tells the truth no matter what. Detective Cruz? l don't know if l should be talking about this. About what? Liz was a private person, you know? But l want to help. Well, that's why l'm here. l just don't know how to say this. Liz had this craving. Craving for what? For men. Strange men. No one knew, not even Marcie or Julie. lt was her thing. l respected that. And what was her thing? Sex. Sex? With strangers. She wasn't into the boys at school. It wasn't about boys. She liked the real thing. Real, live, strange men. She'd have her way with them. They'd be gone by dawn. ln and out. Never to be heard from again. That's the way she liked it. Not like high school... ...where you sleep with a guy and the entire school knows the next day. You know which bars she frequented? l have a pretty good idea. -Hi, Brenda. -That seat's saved. But l always sit here. You do? l'm sorry. This stall is reserved. What? Haven't you met Vylette? lt's all about Vylette. Have you guys seen the new girl? Who is she, anyway? -l don't know. -No one does. -And her last name? -lt's the Madonna thing. -She toured with Madonna. -She's a model. -Totally bicoastal. -Or just plain bi. -Hot. -l know. Right? Zach? Nice to meet you. l'm Vylette. Yeah, l know. l saw you in Grease... ...twice. You did? What can l say? You rocked my world. l rocked your world? lt beats football. Not that l have a problem with football. l am head cheerleader. Head cheerleader... ...and star of the school play. Well, that's a first. ls it? Yeah, it is. Let me tell you something. Sports and drama... ...it's like plaids and stripes. They don't mix. Well, the rules have been changed... ...haven't they? Your ass is much too precious for vinyl. Thank you. Hi, girls. What's wrong with this picture? -ls this spot mine? -Yeah. l really like it here. lt's really great to have someone to disappear with. Someplace to go. You know a girl named Vylette? She just got cast in the play. What? Well, you know, she's new. l guess. lt's weird, though. She saw me twice in Grease. She said that l rocked her world. lt doesn't quite all add up to me, though. Do you know a girl named Fern? Fern Mayo? Come on. The girl, she's a little geeky? -She does errands for Ms. Sherwood. -l think l know. Well, Fern Mayo is Vylette. What do you mean? She's Courtney's... ...creation. Why would Courtney give her the time of day? You don't want to know. l do. Please tell me. Liz Purr is part of it. Jesus, Julie! What is it? Do you know how girls kidnap their girlfriends on their birthdays? Well, we do that. Courtney had a stroke of genius. lt was totally disgusting. Courtney put her back in the bed... ...and tried to make it like she was raped. That's when Fern showed up. Take her place. So what're you gonna do? l don't know. -You gotta do something. -l know. -You can't pretend nothing happened-- -l know that. You gotta tell somebody. -l'm taking Dane to the prom. -Surprise! Aren't we cocky? Too bad you don't have the cock part down. Well, at least l'm not jocking it. Dane may be a jock... ...but let's face it. He was born to be prom king. What he does after prom is his problem. He could get married, coach Little League. l could give a shit. He's a yearbook photo... ...a piece of nostalgia that won't stand the test of time. -So where's the cherry bomb? -Rehearsal. Good. Julie can kiss drama boy goodbye. l think Vylette is out of control. The car, the parking place.... lt's like when people first get money. They're called nouveau riche. They drape themselves in fur and jewels. They're pathetic, but they don't know any better. But Vylette-- Vylette is the same. For once in her pathetic life, people are giving her the time of day. The little whore is milking it for all she's worth. What the hell? -You stupid cow! -What? -Courtney! -Get off. Who the heck do you think you are? Angelyne? What the fuck are you doing? Exactly what you taught me. l taught you to disrespect us? You taught me to rule. That's right. Rule, bitch! But don't forget who made you. l'm sorry. l'm at the mercy of the crowd. l can't help it, Courtney. They love to hate me. Don't fool yourself. Deep down, they know who you are, Fern. l'm Vylette. You're whatever the fuck l want you to be. Courtney. Pretty little Courtney. Let's stop pretending, shall we? You once spoke of ammo. Ammunition, if l'm correct. l don't know why, but it really struck me. Lately, it's all come clear. And on a clear day, baby, you can see tomorrow. Excuse me? l've got the power. Her name's sweet Liz, remember? Your bloated boo-boo? -l'll fucking shred you, you whore! -And l'll tell a secret. Do tell. But don't be surprised when they laugh in your face. Cruz has a suspect in custody. lt ain't me. l know the truth. l know what really happened, Courtney. l made you, and l can break you just as easily. Good idea. Kill me like you did Liz. You're doing the right thing. l know, l know. Everything's gonna be okay, right? Right. But l'm guilty too. Courtney will say l was there. -l didn't stop them or tell the police. -We need evidence. That would be great. But Courtney destroyed everything. What about the Polaroid? Wasn't there a camera? -She took a picture. -And who has it? -l don't know. -What do you mean? l don't know! It was chaos. We popped the trunk. She dropped it. She dropped the camera. Okay, it was right about here. lt's gone. Look, Julie, is there anything else? There's nothing. At this point, it's my word against hers. Looks like that's gonna have to be good enough. l understand you have something about the Liz Purr murder. We have a suspect in custody. We found the man leaving Liz's house. lf his semen matches-- What're you talking about? Liz wasn't as innocent as she appeared to be. Bullshit! lt's not true. lt's difficult for you to understand-- Excuse me. This isn't happening. Liz was a virgin. Someone had sex in that bed after Liz died. lt was just the four of you. Wait a minute. Unless someone went back. Oh, my God! -What? -She said it herself. They'll believe it because it's their worst nightmare. Liz Purr, the picture of teenage perfection... ...obliterated by perversion. What are you saying? Courtney found a guy to have sex in Liz's bed... ...to make it look like murder. Come on. We gotta get out of here. -Where are we going? -We are gonna bring that bitch down. Vylette? Oh, my God! What the hell is this? Well, there you are. You had quite a fall. -What happened? -You fainted out in the quad. l want you to take it easy... ...Fern. What did you say? -Your name is Fern Mayo, correct? -No, it's not. -Well, that's what it says right here. -Get me out of here. There she is! This is crazy! Fern Mayo! Fern fucking Mayo! l thought you looked familiar! Take off your mask, Fern! Shut up! lt's over, bitch. What the hell is this? Oh, my God! Fern, are you okay? Fern, it's me, Julie. l'm not Fern. -Oh, my God! -lt's okay, Fern. Go away. Please just go away. How can you look at me? l'm shit. -l'm reprehensible. -No, you're not. l'm nothing. Before all this, l was something. Not much, but something. You were a good person, Fern. A lot of good that did me. l'm nothing. l'm shit. l'm a nobody. l don't blame you for what you did. l know what it's like to be scared. That day, we were terrified. lt's not like you had a choice. l'm so sorry, Julie. l'm so sorry. lt's okay. l know. What a fucking tearjerker! Look. lt's like Terms of Endearment, part three. Only this time, the boyfriend's gay. And the rest of the cast sucks! Who the fuck are you? What? They charged some poor guy with murder? What have you done, Courtney? What have you done? Just what l had to do, dear. What? Destroy another life? -Life's a bitch, then you die. -No, honey, you're the bitch. So aggressive, Julie. lt kind of turns me on. l'm sure Fern likes it. Come on, Marce. This train wreck's getting old. lt's over, Courtney. l am petrified. See you at prom tonight, Julie. Some poor, nameless son of a bitch thought he got lucky. Boy, was he wrong, huh? How could she do that? She's so evil. And she's only in high school. What are we gonna do? We make her pay for what she did. We could go to prom. You're not serious, are you? Great idea. And on the way, let's pick up some pig's blood. -That's real cute. -Can you take me home? lt's a shame Julie couldn't make it tonight. lsn't her boyfriend in drama? l bet they couldn't decide who got to wear the dress. You are evil. Listen to the queen of the damned over here. Come in. -Hi, honey. -Hi, Mom. Mrs. Purr came by today and brought some things over... ...of Liz's that you might like to have. Thank you. -Good night, babe. -Good night, Mom. I killed Liz. I killed the teen dream. Deal with it. To prom queens. To prom queens. Oh, my God! How original. Nothing like a little girlfriend to spice up an evening. How about some public affection, girls? lt's like, how low could you possibly get? Carpet munchers! Do you hear something? No. Do you hear something? No, l don't. Well, if it isn't the beautiful people. l've been meaning to tell you. You are to die. To die! Thank you. l am so bored tonight. l think it's time for a little room service. Reality check. There's an announcement that needs to be made. Give it up for the prom queen. Oh, my God, Courtney! l am so sorry. lt's okay. We can't all be up to speed, can we, girls? l'm sorry. l'm very sorry. That was wonderful, wasn't it? Welcome to Reagan High's senior prom!
