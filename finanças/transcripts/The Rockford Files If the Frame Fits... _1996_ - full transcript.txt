(ANGEL WHISTLING) ANGEL: Jimmy? (LAUGHING) Hey, Jimmy! Yeah, well, here he is. What are you doing here? Buying supplies. Light bulbs, Johnny Mop. A drag. You ain't working? Ah, I figured I ought to see Beth Van Sant's movie, The Brief. They adapted it from her novel. Any good? Well, The Brief, The Firm. I wonder when are these ex-lawyers going to write a book called The Fee. Spare change? No, thanks. I'm fine. So, uh, The Fee, that's a joke, huh? (LAUGHING) Hey, bud, help me get a cup of coffee? I hate these parasites on the body politic. Sure, you're a fiscal conservative. No, I go down to the Queen of Angels Hospital for treatment and these people, they're clogging up the hallways, they are demanding attention. Hey! Give me some money, man. Stinker. Darla, get away from my pizza. Watch it, huh? I'm sorry. Bye. Look out, pal. Jim? Scotty, what are you doing here? It's where I'm at, dude. You're living on the street? Dining alfresco. (LAUGHING) I knew Al Fresco. He used to shoot speed with him in Minneapolis, St. Paul. Do your parents know you're here? Don't know, Jim. Hey, you got a smoke? I quit. You don't know? I don't see them that often, to tell you the truth. I mean, what the hell. You think they'd care? Come on, Scotty. Hey, you... You got a... Sir? Not if the Prize Patrol just handed me 10 million big ones. Here. What happened to the kayak rentals? Ah, I got tired of getting knocked on my ass helping some tourist and his wife get through some heavy surf. Damaged a disk in my back. RadioShack? Whoa, they don't want to see me back there again. (CHUCKLING) Scotty, is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, quit looking down on me for starters. Not everybody can march to your Republican drum. I don't vote any ticket. And I never lectured you in that way. Jimmy, who is that? You think you got problems? Who is it? That's Dennis Becker's son. Get out of here! Hey! Here. Scoot! (DRUM BEATING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) ROCKFORD: Peg told me you were here. Why are you working security? I'm doing it for nine bucks an hour. Well, $11, if the show goes past midnight. Past midnight? Sometimes, to be honest, after a full day at the division, I'm literally asleep on my feet, that punk rock pounding in my ear. But we do this for our kids, right? (DRUM BEAT) Oh, doors open in 20 minutes. Showtime. Yeah, who's playing? New Age group. Girl with a harp. Celtic whatever. Actually, the music is pretty nice. And last week, they had this group called The Hole with Courtney Love. Imagine that this was your kid. Smart girl, though. You know, one time they had me bring her up an extension cord. Right up on stage. So, in about two months you'll have Scotty's debt paid off? More or less. Dennis, how often do you see him? Can you imagine Scotty's business partner saying that Scotty raided the assets of the business and sold the kayaks up in Carpinteria? It's hard to imagine. And all this psycho's got for proof is that Scotty rented a U-haul the day of the burglary and it was returned up in Carpinteria. Sorry, my friend. I've been a police officer too long and that's all circumstantial evidence. Mmm-hmm. This here guy was gonna file charges unless he gets his full share, so you pay. Blood money. I mean, the kid's had his share of bad luck. Scotty's not a kid. I mean, kayak rentals, La gun a Beach. Man, I thought this was gonna take off. Well, the thing is, people go to that part of La gun a, you know, they're going there to eat. They're dressed. They're not necessarily interested in renting kayaks. (SIGHING) Yeah, well, I gotta go. But, Dennis... What? (SIGHS) You got a piece of kraut right here. Okay? (SIGHS) (CLEARING THROAT) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Yeah? You have to promise me you'll use this to clean up and get a job. So there's strings attached to this Mother Teresa move, huh? As it applies to you, if Mother Teresa met enough like you, she'd go out and buy herself a BMW. You people love to demonize us homeless. "You people?‚Äù Hey, I'm your godfather. And as far as being homeless, yeah, I have a little problem with that term in your case. Maybe it's because I remember the 18-foot trailer your dad co-signed for. What was that? The, uh, "Traveling Jack Kerouac Museum"? Of course, that was long before the kayaks. Come on, Jim, that wasn't my fault. That could've been huge. I just couldn't get the rights from the Kerouac estate. Yeah, well, some Republicans might've nailed that down (ELISABETTA LAUGHING) before they bought the trailer. Oh, yeah, then there was the tragedy with the trailer hitch. Design flaw, wasn't it? Lucky, my buddy, Rick, wasn't killed. He was asleep back there. Scotty, your dad cares about you... Hey, Prince Charles! Prince Charles! Yuppie scum. What, are you sneaking on by, huh? IAN: Just ignore the man. Hey, you remember me, missus? Huh? ROCKFORD: Hey, Scotty. Scotty, come on! Keep him on a leash! What's the matter with you? You can't assault people that way. Not to stay out of the cooler. People? Mr. and Mrs. God. Think they can run me with their lousy money. Well, why not? I'm trying it myself. Scotty, look, I want to give you this $100. Give you a shot. And I want to get you an apartment. In fact, that's already in the works. But you gotta stay employed. I, uh, got a job lined up. Nothing great, entry-level thing, but you've gotta promise me you will stick it out. Thanks, Jim. Home sweet homicide. Well, it's something you can realistically carry until the prepaid month runs out. Prepaid month? I'm gonna find the super, get the key. ANGEL: Yeah? The key? I had to get an extra one made. You don't supply two keys? (CHUCKLING) I don't make the rules, the owner does. MAN: Hey, amigo! ANGEL: The float's on order! You can buy a toilet float flush anywhere! For three days my kids have been going next door to relieve themselves. I'm working on it. Yeah. Well, my family's coming over here. (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) How much for a second key? Eleven bucks. Hey, Jimmy, who cut you a special deal on that security deposit? I mean, sure, I live rent-free, but I'm a slave to the place. So, you're Dennis Becker's kid, huh? (LAUGHING) Mr. Holier-Than-Thou. (LAUGHING) Well, then, you can get yourself a used TV. Maybe put it over in the corner. You know, a Fillmore Ballroom poster. Jim, it's great. It's home. Let me get in the shower. It's job orientation day, huh? Godfather. SCOTTY: Restaurant work. Dad told you about that crazy semester at that Ecole de Cuisine in London? Or you remembered yourself? Well, now that you mention it. I go back before that. Even when you were 12 years old, you had the touch with the fresh trout. Those fishing trips to June Mountain. You, me, your dad. Lose the hat. Was my dad on those trips or hot on the trail of the Hillside Strangler? Okay, Scott, you'll be available to start work tomorrow morning? Shoot, I'm ready to start work right now. Oh, are you? Yes, sir. Raimondo! You two are gonna be working together. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Okay, Scott, you don't need me here. A friend of mine wants to borrow my truck, so I'm gonna drop it off. I'll see you later. Huh? Oh, okay. Drop by. I'll grill some burgers. Tomorrow. CRITCH: Okay, we gotta clean this thing up. Take out all the rocks and chop down and rake out all the vegetation. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Al right. That channel drain runs off from the whole canyon. Dog poop, you name it. That water's loaded with E-coli bacteria. I'm not asking you to drink it. I thought I was gonna work back in the restaurant. Look, this is what I've got that has to be done. Now, how do you want to handle it? E-coli, man. English, not so much. El Salvador. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yeah. You like it here? Uh... (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yeah. But, see, the old American dream is dead. My grandfather, guys his age, those were the last guys who really experienced it. The middle class? Fools, man. They got ripped off. Yeah, oh. Oh. (SPEAKING SPANISH) For me, here is good job. Well, sure, Ray. Look at us, dude. Hydraulic engineers. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) E-coli, man. Watch out. (LAUGHING) I liked The Brief as a book. You didn't like it? The movie was a little bit better paced, I'll say that for it. Mmm. Captain, have you seen The Brief? Occasionally. But we don't put too much stock in it. I'm gonna go get another beer. What's McEnroe doing here? He overheard me invite Nomoto and his wife and I had no choice. And then Nomoto bails. (DOOR CLOSING) Who has more fun than us? Who's in the house? Scott. Hi, honey. Mom, Dad. Hey, Son, what the hell are you doing here? Come here. Hi. We didn't even hear you drive up. Honey, this is Captain McEnroe. You've heard Dad talk about him. Captain, this is our son, Scotty. Scotty. Hi. Come on, sit down and eat, okay? I don't want to intrude. What are you talking about, intrude? Eat. PEGGY: Dessert, anyone? Oh, yeah. All right. (PEGGY HUMMING) (CHUCKLES) I hate to eat and run, but, uh... Honey, there's dessert. Uh, there's some people waiting. Dad, can we take care of that situation we discussed earlier? Yeah, sure. SCOTTY: Goodbye. Bye. Bye, Mom. I told you, my son is not homeless! Dennis, I'm only telling you what I saw. I don't care what you say, my son is not homeless! Oh, okay, all right, then he and his friends have suntans that are the envy of all of us. Is that a better way to put it? BECKER: Always ready with the quip, aren't you? You've been screaming at me for half an hour. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. All right, all right. Why take it out on Jim? Whatever's going on, it's our fault and not his. Wait, just hold on one minute, okay? I want you to go with me, okay? No, Dennis. Just come with me, okay? Dennis. Just come. All right, all right. This is his room. Is this a home? You and Peg gave him a beautiful home. Homeless is a loaded term, buddy. It implies a whole bunch of stigmatized behaviors, like, panhandling, psychosis. He's panhandling? I'm sorry, Dennis. Oh, my God. Look, Peg, I'm sorry. I really am. I remember when I was in the Army. I mean, when I was a kid, more than once I would have to bum bus fare back to camp. Dennis, let Jim talk. Well, he hit me up for change and Angel. I gave him 100 bucks, I found him a room and got him a job at the Sand Castle. When was that? Uh... A week ago. CRITCH said after a half a day, he disappeared, along with a... A prime rib dinner that was waiting for takeout. (SIGHS) You knew that my son was homeless a week ago and you didn't tell me? Well, Dennis, there was nothing... Get out! Out! Dennis. Well, no, no, no, no, that's just fine. Fine. I won't have to be a victim of his damned espresso machine. (ENGINE ROARING) Buy you a cup of coffee? No, thank you. Can you turn off the engine, please? (ENGINE ROARING LOUDLY) I'm sorry about last night, okay? Talk about "kill the messenger.‚Äù I was only trying to help, you know. Think I enjoyed being the bearer of that kind of news? I didn't sleep all night. Me, neither. Look, I gotta talk to him. Peg has been God-awful all day. I'd appreciate it if you could tell me where's the room you rented him. 3214, Venice Boulevard. Apartment eight. Thank you for everything that you did for him. I know that you are his godfather and everything. I'll pay you back, you know that. Well, I guess I'll take a ride down there and see what's what. (ENGINE ROARING) Well... Dennis, you want some company? BECKER: The last time I saw him, he was unemployed, but he had a girlfriend, she had a van, he was looking for work, he was headed for Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? I know it rains, but there's jobs. He was gonna hook up with the salmon fleet. Anybody in your family have a radio? The salmon industry's completely depressed. There's no fish. Yeah? That's always been the poor kid's problem. Timing. Dennis, he's not a... Kid. ROCKFORD: The ex-business partner, is that what the money was for that you gave him last night? No, the bass. You remember, he had that little group. The Homicide Dicks. Yeah, that was his little tribute to me. Anyway, he said he knew a way he could make a little spare change as a musician in the interim. (CHUCKLES) I figured, what the hell. Weddings, bar mitzvahs, not a bad way to go. Well, Dennis, uh... The interim? Between what and what? (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (MACHINE WHIRRING) Oh, hey, wait, wait. You're, uh... You! I remember! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Wait, wait, hold on. Scott Becker rented you this apartment? (SPEAKING SPANISH) How much? (SPEAKING SPANISH) $225. $225? I paid $200. Where is Scott Becker live now? Mmm... (SPEAKING SPANISH) Angel, open up! It's not about maintenance work. Are you aware the tenant in eight has sublet? I'm not responsible for any renter, nor for the welfare, debts or obligations of said renter. Fine. That's between you and the landlord. You have any idea where my son is? What does this mean? Does this mean that if I know, the next time I'm hauled down to Metro for some popcorn charge, I can count on you to lose the paperwork? I ought to bust you right in the chops. (LAUGHING) Go ahead, make my IRA account. Angel, damn it! Okay, I got a note in there, but, yeah, it reminds me I gotta do something. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey, kids, I told you, wipe out those chalk marks. No hopscotch! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Ten go la rod. I tell you what, this guy's fantastic. He's been here two days, painted the whole place, ripped up all the mildewed flooring under the sink. Angel, the address? Here. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (STUTTERS) The cab driver. What a guy, man. Four hours a day, he does this stuff and still keeps his job at the Sand Castle. Knows how to do everything. Plumbing, wiring, and what he doesn't know how to do, he learns. What does he get for busting his hump for you? A break in the rent? I'm teaching him English. When you pass a mirror, is there a reflection? Martin, it's important that I find my son. Yeah, Jimmy, I tell you, that Raimondo is something. Better than the last tenant we had in here. The only thing I saw him working on was a 40 of Olde English. It's my address. (CLICKING TONGUE) Come on. We'll try his old turf. SCOTTY: (SINGING) The night they drove ol' Dixie down And all the people were singing (HUMMING) Dad? What the hell are you doing? I thought you joined a group. You and Jerry again, playing catered affairs. Jerry sucks. All's him and his wife can harp on is how much I owe him from seven years ago. Seven years ago and he hasn't forgiven me for the costumes yet. The money I gave you, the rent... The costumes? Dad, look, this is only temporary. If I get in the union, I could even be scoring TV shows. A friend of mine from high school, he's making $7 million a year. What, you can't even play one bar mitzvah, for crying out loud? Here we go again. I'm wrong again. Sorry, Lieutenant. Hey, but you know something? You know something? It's better than panhandling. It's true, ain't it? Dad, I couldn't tell you and Mom that even Seattle was a bomb-out, you know? You bastard! (BOTH GRUNTING) BECKER: Wait, buddy. Come on, Scotty. Come on, knock it off! Ian, stop! lan! SCOTTY: Get off me, Dad! I called the police! Please, stop! I am the police! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (ELISABETTA SPEAKING ITALIAN) Scum! Son of a bitch! Somebody stop him, please! He'll kill my husband! Please stop him! Come on! Come on! (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Come on, back it up here. Come on. Get your hands off of me! Okay, all right, break it up. Becker, LA. Arrest him, Lieutenant. This man tried to kill me 10 minutes ago! GENCHER: Okay, just a minute, Mr. Levin. He started it, Dad. Dad? Maybe you ought to stand over here with me, Dennis. What's up, man? Street fight, Lieutenant. Just starting to sort it all out. This man assaulted me. My wife and I were walking and he began using profanity. When I protested... That's not what I saw. Did I ask? Lieutenant Becker, LA. Is this man wanted in your jurisdiction? He's my son. Let me explain, Officer. Who are you, Mr. Explainer? I don't think we need you. He's talking about just now. Damned right I hit him first. We were in the alley and he started attacking me with a bloody traffic cone! 'Cause you were pushing me! Look at this brute. Let me show you something. He hit my husband and then he ran away like a coward! (ELISABETTA SPEAKING ITALIAN) I warned you, Jesse. His name is Scott. The lecture you gave him the last time obviously meant nothing. You know my son, Lieutenant? Oh, yeah. Scott and I go back a long way, don't we, Scott? And this time, unfortunately, we're gonna be placing you under arrest. Uh, Lieutenant, may I talk to you for a minute? Privately? Sure. Well, we know where this is headed. ELISABETTA: Are you okay, darling? IAN: Yes, I'm all right. Scott, would you step into our police car, please? SCOTTY: Dad? But, Lieutenant... Dad? Some small satisfaction. Jimbo? Head down. (OFFICER CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) Great. Just great. Geez, you'd think the fact that we're both police officers would count for something! You mean the fix would be in? I resent that. I think this thing is still swelling up. If you can't be supportive... I've been supporting your son all week. Boy, I tell you, being out here certainly changes the whole perspective. How many times have I sat in that office, looking out here at some young man's parents, pale and scared? Excuse me, but isn't this the third or fourth time to the plate for the same perspective? What? The marijuana bust. Reduced to a misdemeanor. Possession. The reckless endangerment, when the trailer did the bouncing Betty down the canyon face? Design flaw in the trailer hitch. I think that design flaw was called a six pack. Look, I told you. And I don't want to hear this stuff about how you supported him all week. I didn't want to say anything... But? But you allowed him to live in the premises of Angel Martin, a known felon. I don't believe this. And you're his godfather! Dad, they're booking me. Uh, Gene, isn't there something that we can do? Dennis, let me talk to you for a moment. BECKER: Yeah, sure. Have a seat. Listen... GENCHER says the trouble between Scotty and Levin goes way back. Well, they live near the Promenade? One of those high-rise apartments along Ocean Avenue. Levin had Scotty arrested last month. Said that he was aggressively panhandling his wife and then threw something at him. My God, he's got a prior on this? Levin dropped the charges. Apparently, unlike the other property owners over there, Levin and his wife are sympathetic to the homeless. Gene says that Scotty keeps dogging them, hassling them. You know who she turns out to be? Hmm. Yeah. ELISABETTA Fama. This was on the news stand right where the fight happened. BECKER: Cutting edge fashion designer, daughter of Sicilian aristocracy, her husband runs the company. No way, this ain't gonna make the press. Oh, Dennis, come on. Felony assault. All right, I tell you what, why don't we go down to the Fama boutique tomorrow? We'll see if we can't straighten this thing out, all right? You don't have to come. I've been doing these kind of investigations for 30 years. The doctor who treats himself has a fool for a patient. WOMAN: Good afternoon, House of Fama. How may I direct your call? I'll see if he's available. One moment. Has pretty pricy stuff, huh? WOMAN: I'm sorry, he's in a conference right now... Corey is waiting downstairs. PUNCH: Gentlemen, Mr. Levin will see you now. Thank you, Punch. PUNCH: No problem. Sorry we had to ask you to wait. We're in the throes of introducing the second season, fall season of our youth line, Fama All or a. Anyway, Mr. Becker, I admit I feel for you. I can't say that I don't. I can say I don't. What ELISABETTA means is... Don't speak for me. I hate when you do this. Can I get either of you a mineral water? (CHUCKLES) Punch, two waters, please. Yes, sir. (SIGHS) Oh, the things your son said to me. Oh, you never wash his mouth out with soap? BECKER: Well, it's American youth culture. The parents are kind of defenseless. You must understand that the first time I met up with your son, I gave him money. All the change I had. IAN: And, Bette, another time, didn't you bring out a sandwich at his request? You were going into the Broadway Deli, as I recall. Yes. Eggs over easy with bacon. They wouldn't allow him in there, so I paid for it. But then it was every day. Every day with his hand out, not begging for my money, demanding it. And the first time I ever turned down his request... Well, I hope you understand how difficult it is for Lieutenant Becker to hear these things about his son. What are you thinking? That we are lying? Well, no, no, it's just hard. What are you doing serving drinks, Bella? Gentlemen, this is one of our chief designers, Katinka Von Durow. I had to come back in here, anyway. Fax. Milano. Just came in. (ELISABETTA SPEAKING ITALIAN) Yes, cotton is okay. Okay. That peplum idea of yours really works, Kat. Mr. Rockford, your connection to this... Are you the Becker family attorney? Friend of the family. He's my son's godfather. My son was raised in the bosom of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. He had a dog, he was a crossing guard, he was a good boy. He was not just some anonymous freak. Dennis, Dennis. Lieutenant, he is no longer that boy. He is no longer a boy. He is a man. An assaultive, hostile man, who unfortunately cannot support himself. He needs help, your son. But he's not going to get it from us. He's going to jail. Hmm? (ELISABETTA SPEAKING ITALIAN) I got a little Italian blood in me. I got it from my mother's side. There's an old saying... (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Lieutenant, no one is breaking out the wine and cheese, eh? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Hostile? They don't even know him. Oh, sure he is. Dennis, Scotty's had a chip on his shoulder for years. What are you doing, taking their side? We can't help him unless we see him clearly. Can I get your car? A bum, a loafer, a small-time crook. But not beyond resuscitating. Not yet. It's all my fault. I was gone so much. Ah, it's rough on cops' kids. Stinking police work. I mean, there would be Scotty running in a track meet and I'd be out busting dealers and perverts, the worst. You want my advice? As his godfather... Damn, I'm getting tired of hearing that. Yes, I want your advice. It's not so much that you weren't there, it's the way you over-compensated because you weren't. What, we spoiled him? We held him to a very tough standard. Oh, please, Dennis. He got Ds all through college and what'd you do? You bought him a more powerful computer. But you need memory to compete in the academic race at all. Oh, is he? Is he in the academic race at all? Well, he's not officially taking classes... Oh, officially? I forgot. You can earn college credits sleeping in the city flower beds and urinating in a parking structure. All right, all right, he flunked out! You shouldn't have been contributing one thin dime tuition all those years he was goofing along with Cs and Ds. That's what Peg said. Well, you're still doing it. You're subsidizing all his fiascoes. You're acting as spin doctor after every embarrassment. Spoiling him. You have to cut him off, Dennis. Make him swim in cold water. You're right, you're absolutely right. You said it before. You're right. Tough love. (DOOR BUZZING) MAN: Here we go. Hi, honey. I saw a man die. Sir, you want to step over here, please, and collect your things? The cell across from mine. He was a Nigerian or something. He was crying all night and this other man punched him, not that hard. About 10 minutes later, with a seizure... He's dead. Ah, come on, Son. Let's just get your stuff and get out of here. Jim. Hi, Scotty. Jim's here because... What day is it? Yeah. It's your birthday, you knucklehead. The big three-‚ô™, baby. His gums were blue. Scotty, it's tragic, I know. I brought you a change of clothes. Now, we're all going to go to Michael's and have lunch. Celebrate. BECKER: We're going to talk about next year's birthday, where you'd like to be and how you're gonna get there. ALL: (SINGING) Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Scotty Happy birthday to you (SIGHS) Scotty? Honey? It may not seem like an auspicious birthday, but it is. And today, though you may not know it, you know, a clean slate, you're reborn, a new way of doing things. Well, what are you looking at? Smoke from that candle. (CHUCKLES) Life's an illusion. Smoke. Right. And, uh, for a while you've been fooling yourself. You're born and then you're doing the limbo on concrete. There was that fellow and then you have this Bill Gates of Microsoft. Is Bill Gates happy? Are you guys happy, with your house, your marriage, your big screen TV? My friends on the Promenade, with nothing but their wanting and neediness. Is there happiness in either place? Well, where you want to watch the Super Bowl? Our house, right, Jim? All this having and not having. There's gotta be a better way. What's the answer? What's the question? Father Brady, he was always trying to get me to see this. Your coach at Loyola? I wonder where he is right now. Bakersfield? Be great to see him. Whatever. From here on out, Son, you're on your own. Kayaks, legal fees, the works. And you know something? I say this with love. What's his problem? Here you go, sir. (BANGING ON DOOR) Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Just a minute. GENCHER called me. ELISABETTA Fama has been murdered. Her body was found in a dumpster at 2:00 in the morning. Where's Scotty? I don't know. He kept talking about Father Brady, then he asked me if he could borrow the car. I said no, like you said, remember? But he was gone when GENCHER called. My darling godson knows where I keep my Hide-A-Key. Oh, no, the Fire bird! (OFFICER CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) GENCHER: According to the sergeant, she wasn't carrying any cash. Did your wife take any money with her? No, no. Just a credit card. Becker, LA. Hey, Gene! OFFICER: Go ahead. (MUMBLES) Hi, bud! Quite a commotion, huh? What'd he say? "Quite a commotion, huh?" I can't stand just standing here. TOOTHLESS BOB: (MUMBLES) Say, she... She was a nice lady. Pretty, too. (MUMBLES) I'm a witness, waiting for my interview. He's a witness waiting for his interview. Witness to what? What did you see? Dennis! Hey, Gene, I got here as quick as I could. Where's the tar pits? Tar pits? Oh, this is not LA? Then I'll handle the witnesses. Hey, I'm sorry, Gene. I just didn't want there to be any foul-ups. Dennis, he understands. Now, then, Mr. Rukhuyser, the sergeant tells me that you saw Scott Becker a.k.a. Jesse, prior to the killing. About a hour before I heard the sirens. So, Scott Becker is in the area and an hour later ELISABETTA Fama is dead. TOOTHLESS BOB: He was real cool and calm. Kind of dreamy-like. Gave me $200. Aw, geez, no! According to her husband, she didn't have any money with her when she left the apartment for Starbucks. She grabbed a credit card. It's still in her pocket. So whose money is that? That's what I'm trying to figure out, Dennis. It's my money, that's whose money it is. You can't prove that, bud! Hey, Gene, just a word of advice. Yes, Dennis? Just because the victim has a credit card doesn't mean that robbery wasn't the original intent. Dennis. I mean, it doesn't prove that the intent was revenge or harassment. Mr. Rukhuyser, did Scott Becker say anything to you? Jesse? Yeah. Uh, something about smoke, life was illusion... Gene, we can safely assume... Stay off my crime scene, Lieutenant! Come on, Dennis, come on, come on. Hey, wait a minute. Come on, Dennis... Hold on a minute! Jesse beds down right there, right behind that dumpster. Thank you. Jimbo, I should tell him. I should tell him about the car and I can't. All right, I'll handle it. You stay here. OFFICER: Stay behind the tape. We got press coming through. Come on, Joe, let's move right now. Make sure you're rolling. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. His car? Excuse me, Lieutenant, Pat Lalama. Nice to see you. What have you got going? Yeah. Well, uh, there's been a murder. It's ELISABETTA Fama, the fashion designer. PAT: And the word here now is that the prime suspect in this brutal killing, Scott Dennis Becker, may have fled in a 1978 gold Fire bird. That license plate number, by the way, 8-5-3-0-K-G. And, John, I have a rather interesting development to tell you about. Police sources here are telling me that the wanted man is in fact the son of a police department robbery/homicide investigator, Lieutenant Dennis Becker. It was the sudden and tragic ending to the life and career of ELISABETTA Fama. She was born to wealthy landowner parents in Palermo, Sicily. (PHONE RINGING) She was a former model in Milan, who early in her career... BECKER: Whoever it is, I'm not in. ...discovered a starling talent for color and design. Becker residence. And so not only escaped the fate of the aging model... Yeah, this is he. ...but went on to found a fashion house... What? Well, how long have... Is there any damage? ...the biggest names of the late 1980s and 90s. How can you not know? In 1987 she married hair stylist, lan Levin. He proved to be a shrewd businessman, and Levin helped build the House of Fama into a 60 million dollar a year company. ROCKFORD: Ah, yeah. Well, thanks a lot. Their penthouse in Santa Monica was one of five residences the couple owned around the world. (SHUSHING) It's yet another sad comment on the level of violence in this country that she had to meet her death here. Dennis, they found my... Shh. My wife grew up with that sort of European street life. Espresso bars, caf√©s and... That's why we chose to live in the area that we did. The idea that violence would prevent her from fully using the neighborhood was simply something that she couldn't understand. Dennis, they found my car. Oh, yeah? What did they turn up? Well, Scotty's prints... Shh! PAT: Well, I've just been able to learn that police have recovered that gold Fire bird. And they're telling us that the homeless man's fingerprints were found on the steering wheel and the gearshift knob... Homeless man? No word yet, though, on his whereabouts... You think somebody could give me a lift to the impound yard so I can pick up my car? (ALL SHUSHING) MAN ON TV: And we've got some tape in now of the Fire bird at the police impound yard. The owner of this Fire bird, does he, in fact, have any connection to the suspect? Well, apparently, the owner is the suspect's godfather. Reporting live from Santa Monica, Pat Lalama. Back to you. Could somebody give me a lift? I don't know why you just couldn't take a cab. Angel, I've chauffeured you all over this damn city. You're the last non-Amish individual in the county to own a car. Well, you're just gonna have to hang, then, 'cause I got stops to make. How long will they take? As long as they take. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SHOUTING) (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) How far are we going? The Palisades. What the hell are we going there for? I told you. If you want to catch a bus, otherwise... (MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) Okay, gotta haul burro. √Åndale. Let's go. Got a culvert to clean up by 4:30. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Don't tell me, you're acting as a booking agent for day laborers? Nobody ever thought of it before. I mean, that's the beauty of America. Oh, I can see the purple mountain majesty already. Entrepreneurship. A man can come to this country with nothing, and in the matter of a few years, become a titan. I got the idea from Raimondo. Hardest working guy I ever met. You know what he does with every penny that he doesn't put in his kids' mouth? He buys power tools! (STARTS ENGINE) He's gonna be a general contractor, you mark my word. Oh, no doubt about it. Oh, and there's lots like him, too, and all they need for a toehold up... You. Transportation, language skills, career management. Yeah, how much? I'm not prepared to discuss my percentages with you, unless you're willing to become a client. I'd rather drink off the pier. Yo, return-‚ô™ 4:30. Si. I will say this. Since I pay these guys in cash, I'm in a tax-free bracket. Ah, I can see the fruited plain coming into view now. (EXCLAIMS) Will you wait here, just in case? In case of what? They've gone through your car. Oh, just hang on for five minutes! (RADIO STOPS PLAYING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (LAUGHING) Two hundred bucks. Parked in front of a fire station. I'm gonna kill Scott Becker. I believe the man with the pellets and the pail gets first dibs on that. Can you believe they wouldn't release the car to me? What I believe is, you couldn't come up with enough pocket power to float a damn lousy parking ticket. My friend, Jimmy, Mr. Tater Tots. Oh, you know where most of my cash has been going lately. Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do, underwrite your charities by driving you all over town? You see any statues of me in the Vatican? Any signs on the car say "Goodwill Industries,"‚Äù or any little pictures of a wheelchair or something? You said we were going to an ATM. Well, I got a business to run, Floyd. Ah, well, this is where they found the car. I just thought that maybe... Ah, I don't know what I thought. Jimmy, can we please... Ah, Scotty bottomed out. He was making noises like he... He needed spiritual help. Scotty, Scotty. (BELL CLANGING) Excuse me, could I speak to the, uh, the senior priest, or rector? I am Master Jun. (CHUCKLING) This may seem like an oddball question, but would you happen to know a man named Scotty Becker? Would you like to talk to him? Then he is here? Some sanctuary. The head baldy just gives him right up. They live the contemplative life. I doubt if they know he's wanted. I'm not only president of the hair club, I'm also a member. (CHUCKLING) Scotty? He sure ain't a house on fire with that rake, is he? Keeps doing the same patch, too. He's doing that intentionally. I wouldn't put up with it. Here, you want some workers that can get your yard looking sharp, son, you call that number. My boys, they do some planting, too. Jim? You surprised to see me? I'm sorry about the car. I was literally fighting for my sanity. Well, that's good. 'Cause some cynics might say that you were fleeing to avoid prosecution. If you'd like to press charges, I do understand. We're not talking about joy-riding. We're talking about the murder of ELISABETTA Fama. She's been murdered? Yeah. Is lan Levin dead, too? ANGEL: Hey, dig. "A monk asked Chao-Chou, ‚Äú"What's the most important principle in Zen? "And Chao-Chou excused himself with the words, "'I have to go now and make water. "Imagine, even such a trifling thing I have to do in person.' " Amen, brother. The smartest thing you can do right now is turn yourself in. I didn't kill her, Jim. Probably not. Hey, what do you expect? You've thrown the people in your life a lot of Nerf balls over the years. I needed to talk to Father Brady. I drove all the way to Bakersfield. Father Brady died in '92. I broke down and started crying. Something led me here. Well, you were seen on the Promenade right before she was killed. That was immediately after I got back from Bakersfield. Something was already telling me to divest myself of all material wealth. Actually, it was my material wealth you were divesting yourself of. You, too, may find enlightenment. And maybe I could've gotten a better price. The Third Noble Truth says that selfish craving can be overcome, Jim. Well, I have this selfish craving right now to rip your head off your neck and drop kick it into the carp pond. Now, come on. You're gonna turn yourself in. (GONG SOUNDING) But it's time for Zazen. You are welcome to join us. (CHUCKLING) Hey, Pasadena. No matter how much soy sauce you put on the stuff, it still tastes like fish. Zazen is meditation. MAN: Open up Charlie. All right, let's go. Scott, do you have anything to say to me or your mother? Mom, don't cry. There's no sadness. The Sixth Patriarch said, "It is neither the flag nor the wind that is moving, "it is your mind that is moving." Now, what the hell did he mean by that? (CRYING) Oh, Dennis. MAN 1: Lock it up. MAN 2: Thanks. MAN: Let's go now to Pat Lalama, who's in the field with the latest on the murder of ELISABETTA Fama. PAT: We've been able to confirm that Scott Becker surrendered to police about 6:00 p.m. yesterday, but there's a strange twist to all of this. Police sources now tell us that he's become a novice monk at the One Truth Zen Temple. Officials there had no comment. Here at Boutique Fama, there was a far different sort of silence. Reporting live from Beverly Hills, Pat Lalama. Back to you. MAN: Thank you, Pat. Continuing with our... Good morning, Jim. Judy. Good morning, Jim. Hi, CRITCH. Hey, I'm afraid because of the flu bug we have around here, I'll be serving you myself. Well, I'll have a couple of scrambled eggs, sliced tomatoes, and crisp bacon. Okay. Hey, your car's a TV star these days, isn't it? Just like what's-his-name, uh, Hasselhoff? Got the hassle part right, it's still in impound. Oh. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (UNZIPPING BAG) Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? Do you have scones? Plain or black currant? Black currant, a latte and an ashtray. Sorry, no smoking except in the bar. City ordinance. Oh. You happen to know a dude around here that drives a 1978 gold Fire bird? I'm in the market. Seventy-eight... Damn! Isn't there any waitress in this place? I can't get a refill on my coffee. Uh, excuse me. Uh... Um, Fire bird? Can't say I've seen one. Then my information's wrong. 29 Cove Road. Cove? It's just across here, but the gentleman over there drives a truck, so... So what? So you like Fire birds, do you? I'm president of the Fire bird Club. Where'd you hear about this Fire bird? The Fire bird Club Magazine. Oh. You have any smokes? The bartender. But you can't smoke them in here. Yeah. You said. What does he want with you? I'm afraid to find out. Well, who is he? Do I look like I know? I never saw him before. CRITCH, do me a favor. Go in the bar and if our friend looks like he's coming back, you drop a tray or something. I want to take a look at that luggage tag. Gotcha. CRITCH: Thank you. Morning. Damn. One saffron sash, one pack of mini rice cakes, one cloth. Rakusu. One Rakusu. Luggage tag? M. Pine tree? Doesn't ring a bell. There was no address. 206 area code. Seattle. Dad, did you have something to do with getting me released? What, because I'm a cop? No, it doesn't work that way. The DA just simply didn't have enough hard evidence to file at this time. We're talking murder one. You think they're gonna let you off the hook? PEGGY: Dennis. That's the way it works, Peg. I do this for a living. High profile murder? Homeless person as a prime suspect? Forget about it. It doesn't matter. How can you say that? Well, how can I explain it? I'm just starting out on this path, but, uh, well, one day Hogen came upon four monks and they were arguing about objective reality, and Hogen said, "Here is a big stone. "Do you consider this stone to be inside or outside of your mind?" And one of the Buddhists said, "The Buddhist viewpoint is "that everything is an objectification of the mind, "so I would say the stone is in my mind." And Hogen said, "Your mind must feel really heavy, "carrying around a stone like that." So jail cell or no jail cell, it's all okay with you? I'm sorry I canceled my canasta game. Dad, Jim, you're hard-wired to this dualism thing. Mom, you, too. Good, bad, pain, pleasure, it's all one. Are not this prison and temple equally conducive to sitting and meditating? You might find sitting a bit more painful in prison. I know you're all upset for me and I appreciate that, but just being a novice at the zendo, I'm already happier than I've ever been. I'm reaching a place of no want. No kidding? SCOTTY: I want to show you how I live. Then maybe you'll understand that this murder charge means absolutely nothing in the universe. This is the garden. This is where I work. You work? Yeah, I rake the gravel. See the pattern? Not for nothing, Son, all these years I ask you to mow the lawn, nothing but an argument. If I didn't do it, it never got done. Work can be a form of meditation. But that mower roaring in your ears, Dad... Mom, let's go see my room. (SIGHS) No distractions. That's key. Dare I say it? What, that my room at home was always a mess? I know. No wonder I was always confused. I even remember having a slot-car track under my bed. I had racing cars in my bedroom. How weird. Scotty, your dad went down to Toys-R-Us on Christmas Eve to buy those for you. We were both in need of a Buddha mind. How long do I have to listen to this? What, Jim? If it doesn't bother you, Dennis, it bothers me. He's dumping all over you. Everything you've ever done for him. This woman here, she wiped your butt. Do you understand that? You can stand here with lights reflecting off your head and say you had too much? Your Buddha mind is in your behind. Jim, what if he found religion? All right, you people owe me 200 bucks, huh? The swami here parked in front of a damn firehouse. Will you figure out who's gonna ante up and pay me my money so I can get the hell out of here? (GONG SOUNDING) Time for Zazen. (MONK SHOUTING) BECKER: Everybody get back! Basta! (GUN FIRING) Get back! Basta! Lieutenant Becker, Metro Police! Everybody down! Move it! SCOTTY: Dad! BECKER: Hey, watch it. Scotty, get your mother out of here. I said get out of here! (BOTH GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Hey, Gene, you speak Italian. (SIGHS) Yeah, I'm part Italian. Me, too. We're both paisans. Look, Dennis, I told you if you're gonna come up here, you sit down and you keep quiet, huh? Pine tree, one word. Middle initial, "I." That's the guy. GENCHER: "Mercer I. Pine tree, a.k.a. Mark Pine, ‚ô™.P. Merced. "Attempted murder, State of Washington. "Concealed weapon, Alaska. "Assault with intent to commit, Alaska. "Concealed weapon, Florida. "Currently sought for murder, Ajaccio, Corsica." No crimes against property. (CLEARING THROAT) I see that. Can I say something? Go ahead. It seems to me there are two shooters, both trying to find Scott. A buy-out for the killing of ELISABETTA Fama? Could be. For allegedly killing ELISABETTA Fama. Look, officers, the point is, who'd offer a price like that? Barbra Streisand, because her dress for the Oscars was left unfinished? The husband, lan Levin? Is that his style? When we've got a stolen Sicilian mafioso sitting right here in Santa Monica? Fama's originally from Sicily. Levin would know somebody there. ROCKFORD: Yes, Sicily, right. They are Sicilian aristocracy, wealthy landowners. Either of you guys getting the same feeling I am? No, 'cause it's racist. I agree. At least you guys finally agree on something. Don't we read the papers? We don't watch CNN? The mafia is the industry on that island. Does this guy look like a marquis or an earl to you? It doesn't make sense. The boys are going to hire an Indian from Seattle for backup? Look, whatever, all it means to me is that it's not only the Santa Monica Police Department that thinks your son did this killing. What are you saying? You let criminal conspirators and sociopaths do your thinking for you? How dare you twist my words. I'll twist anything I want when it comes to my flesh and blood! Officers! Officers! I'm going to say, now, what I haven't said before. Say it! Your son did this murder. He had the motive, he had the opportunity, and we will establish the murder weapon! He hated their wealth! He hated her. And your son kept at the Levin's and at them and at them and at them until Mrs. Levin completely took over the role of the victim from him. Until her blood covered an area four foot by four foot! Now, that's what happened, Dennis, and that's what I'm gonna prove! Now get the hell out of this building and don't come back here again, ever! BECKER: He kicked me out. Well, now you know how I always feel. Is that what you're focusing on? Well, no. But still. |I don't know, I don't want to think what I'm thinking, because he's not a killer. He's not. Oh, come on, Dennis, don't panic. Now, who's always the number one suspect in a domestic homicide? The husband. Right. Yeah, but this mountain of evidence. So what it's all circumstantial? I mean, it could actually fry Scotty. Dennis, Dennis, keep your eye on the ball. Okay. The news says that lan is an equal partner in the company, but the company ain't nothing without Fama. That's a pretty tight collar if you're tired of your marriage. What? The magazine I bought said that the youth line, Fama All or a, is a fizzle. The company lost $30 million last year. So lan's nailing a model and watching Fama kiss away the nest egg? Ah, models are nice, but I don't know. Did you notice that, uh, what's her name? The design chief? When she came back into the room with a trivial fax, Levin was the one person she never looked at. Not once, till he spoke to her. He chucks ELISABETTA Fama for her? There's no accounting for taste. What if the assistant was designing some of the clothes, and they could keep the Fama name? Jim, you gotta help me. Oh, Dennis, come on, come on. If I get into it, it's gonna look bad, it's gonna be worse for him. Dennis, I've tried to be supportive. I'll pay you, if that's what you're implying. If that's what it takes. What are you gonna do? Buy me a kayak? (SIGHS) Jimbo? I'm asking you. I'm begging you. (GROANS) Ah, well, the news said that they're having a memorial service for ELISABETTA at Mrs. Ruffner's house tomorrow. It's for friends and family. .. I guess I could poke around a little. I'll be forever grateful. That's what depresses me. Pat, you're on in three, two, one. John, we're outside the home of studio chief, Barry Ruffner and his wife, Lisa. Of course, that couple, long time friends of ELISABETTA Fama. Lisa Ruffner, a noted patron of atelier Fama over the last many years. MAN: That's a cut. Hey, great, Pat. Hi there. Jim Meeker, County Health Department. I'm here to check your food setup. Thank you. Let's go! The eulogies will be over in 15 minutes and these hors d'oeuvres will not be enough to serve these hungry people in black. Sir, sir. (SIGHS) Sir, the guest entrance is back out and around. County Health Department, Office of Communicable Diseases. You received a trans-shipment of seafood from Frank's Fresh Fish, is that right? Louisiana gulf shrimp, yes. Yes. Well, we've got word this morning from the CBC in Baton Rouge that those shrimp may be contaminated. (GASPS) Oh, my God. Well, with what? (GASPS) Botulinus. Oh, Lance! Did you hear that? No, no, no need for fright or panic. No, the containers at Frank's were all determined to contain asymptomatic test specimens, but I will have to inspect the shrimp here on site. Oh, I can't believe this. Oh, poor Lisa. This is a funeral. Well, no trans-sepsis that I can see. Well, don't you need to do slides or a work-up? I don't... Whatever they call it on those horrible medical shows? (LAUGHS) You know, at this stage, a full toxonomic effluvia might be avoided, but I'm gonna have to dissect this one. Well, let's just hope that this little beauty doesn't turn a rusty peach color. Just take a few seconds. (ROCKFORD SIGHS) Continue on with the food preparation. (CHUCKLING) You know, Botulinus is tasteless, but sometimes cooked tainted shrimp can have a mealy texture. But that was delicious. (CHUCKLING) What I'd like to do is, go on out where you're passing the shrimp, fade into the background, very low key, sample one or two. Then if everything's all right, and I'm almost certain it will be, (SIGHS) I'll be out of your hair. (CHUCKLING) Fine. Fine, I guess. (EXCLAIMS) What a scare you gave us. (BOTH LAUGH) Get to work! MAN: Yes. MEADOW: It's so difficult to express how [ feel about ELISABETTA. She was so kind to me, so reassuring. Whenever I had doubts, she'd smile, and her advice to me was, "Be yourself and the clothes will hang." (MEADOW SIGHS) ELISABETTA taught me so much more than how to walk a runway. She taught me what it meant to be a good friend. She wasn't in my life for very long, but her memory will be with me forever. Bye, Betta. We love you. That was nice. (SOFTLY) Thank you. KATINKA: Thank you. My condolences. KATINKA: Thank you, Meadow. We'd again like to thank our hosts, Barry and Lisa, for providing us their home. Thank you. Betta's father, Don Gaetano, in particular, wishes to express his gratitude for allowing him to be a guest at their home during this voyage of sorrow. (SIGHS) His presence at the service would otherwise not have been possible. I'd like to now share with you my recollections of ELISABETTA. (SOFTLY) Did you hear my eulogy? Well, no. I got in at the very end. (SIGHS) I majorly sucked! Oh, no. No, no, no, you were very nice. Yeah, at least what I saw. Genuine feeling is all that matters. God, why do I freeze and get so dopey when I'm speaking to people? I mean, I can walk down a runway naked. Yeah, well, I read where most Americans dread public speaking more than they dread an IRS audit. Really? Mmm-hmm. (SIGHS) Not Gordy. He's a certified public accountant. (SNIFFS) You know whose eulogy I really wanted to hear? Ian Levin's. Did I miss it? Yeah. Load of crap. (GASPS) (CHUCKLING) Hey, it's okay, it's okay. I know all about it. You do? It's disgusting! I mean, she must have known. Maybe. Maybe not. Oh, that's so sad. Which is worse? Good point. Well, what would you do? You know, if you found out? (SIGHS) Complete change of hair color, after I kicked him out. (GAETANO COUGHING) Her dad. Ah. All the way from Sicily. I guess you know about him. Well, I don't know him quite as well as I knew her. It's terminal. Oh, well, I knew that. (MOUTHING) Oh, you! Are you the guy in oil? Me and the anchovies. (LAUGHING) Well, well. The godfather has thought to join us. Yeah, I noticed. Get him out of here. Excuse me. ROCKFORD: Hey. Hey! Come on, come on, get this turkey off me. Hey, Dennis, it's me. Listen, I think I've got a line on what's happening in the... You want to sell this puppy? How the devil did you... (GRUNTS) It's a classic. PINETREE: You didn't finish your breakfast the other day. ROCKFORD: You didn't have to pistol-whip me. I didn't pistol whip you. That's nothing compared to what's coming. You know, I got a little Cherokee blood, if that counts for anything. I'm Tglinkit. We have our own different set of concerns. What did I ever do to you? You know damn well why I'd be hanging around Mrs. Fama's funeral for a lead. Your nephew, Sean Becker. You're gonna take me to him. It's a bounty, right? You're one of the many drawn here by Don Gaetano's offer of money. That was his favourite granddaughter got killed. It's his daughter. Oh. And it's Mrs. Levin, not Mrs. Fama. And it's Scott Becker, not Sean, and he's my godson, not my nephew. Oh. ROCKFORD: Hey, let me ask you something. How did you find out about this prize offered in Sicily all the way up in Seattle? Anchorage, actually. I moved. The Internet. But you can bet I'm not the only one surfing the Net, so time is important. Well, I don't know where Scott is. His family has him in seclusion somewhere. I lived in LA for a while. I remember on the news, they were forever finding stiffs in these canyons. Only they were always killed about a year before. P Now, what's it gonna be? You gonna make it a big day for our cousin coyote? Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Scott's at my place. The 25 Cove Drive address? 29 Cove Road. If you yell, I kill you. That simple. Let me ask you something. What? Aren't you going to feel so silly when you find out you killed the wrong man? Yeah, right. Yeah, hey, the husband, lan Levin? He killed ELISABETTA Fama. I know I'm right. When we get inside, you tell Beckford I'm a friend of yours. You keep everything low key. You're making a mistake. I said Beckford. I meant Becker! Scotty? Scotty? Maybe he's out on the beach. Go to the window. Tell him to come in if you see him. I don't... I don't see him. You think I could get something to eat? I need something in my stomach. I haven't had anything to eat in 12 hours. (CHUCKLING) My blood sugar level's down below my socks. (SCREAMS) Do you have to keep hitting me? Oh, a gun. Okay, where is he? Well, I don't know. A cousin of mine was a PI. Up around Fairbanks. When I was 17, he told my uncle I was a homo. I hate him and I'm gonna take it all out on you. (GRUNTS) I'm not gay, by the way. Fine. Is this Becker's real father? No, that's mine. (EXCLAIMS) "One Truth Zen Temple. Four Noble Truths. "Life is suffering. Suffering is caused by selfish craving." If you're a Buddhist, then how come there's no Buddha statues in here? I dabble in all kinds of religions. You don't see any crucifixes or Stars of David, either. You know what? I think I missed an important newscast. I think this Becker's at that One Truth place. You don't honestly think Scott Becker's stupid enough to hang around an unprotected Zen center, do you? (CHUCKLES) (BEEPING) IAN: Yes. I'd like to speak with Don Guillermo Fama. Don Gaetano has guests and can't be disturbed. My name is Mercer PINETREE. Please respectfully convey to the Don my greetings from Sy Rothstein, with which we both have acquaintance. And tell him I have business relating to the death of his daughter, Elisabeth. (MEN CHATTERING) PINETREE: It's in the back. (MAN SPEAKING ITALIAN) You? (DOCTOR SPEAKING ITALIAN) (GAETANO COUGHING) (BED WHIRRING) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Which of you is PINETREE? That's me, sir. And this is the man that murdered your daughter. (IAN SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Are you the godfather of this specimen? Yes, I'm his godfather, but that's all. It's been a mess for me. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (CHUCKLES) He says, you should've taken a stronger hand with him. Oh, you don't know how I've tried. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) IAN: Why are you wearing that get-up? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) He says the fact that you would hide in the skirts of a priest only makes you more odious. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Yes. And you will get to enact the sufferings of Christ upon the cross. I'm not a killer, Mr. Fama. I didn't... I didn't harm your daughter, I swear! Sit down! And I'm not a blasphemer, either! Just hold on a minute. Don Guillermo, I've come a lot of miles and I've invested a lot of work to qualify for your generous reward offer. And now I believe it's owed to me. I'll kill this Becker, if you like, in front of you. And if that's not convenient, I'll take him to a distant location and videotape it. (SCOFFS) I'm not about to translate that. PINETREE: Now. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (CRYING) Don't do that, Scotty. Don't do that. Not in front of these people. Jim, I'm gonna die. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (COUGHING) He says there is no appeal. (CONTINUES COUGHING) (DOCTOR SPEAKING ITALIAN) (NURSE SPEAKING ITALIAN) (WHEEZING) He's gonna die, too. Our souls will probably cross paths. We won't give a crap about any of this, huh? Look, I've tried. You killed my wife. But I don't believe you should be dealt with in this manner. Oh, sure you do. Shut up, Rockwell. Have you tried telling the Don that you murdered your wife? You beat her to death with pre-meditation? That seem to sway him at all? You're deluded. And then you frame a homeless guy. Excellent touch. Does anybody in here speak English? I do. No, no, Mercer. You have to be able to speak Italian, too. Don Gaetano, this man... Su son-in-law, he murdered... Matar ELISABETTA. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) He wants to know what I'm saying, Levin. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) What are you telling him, the soccer scores? (GRUNTS) Speak. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Speak. You. This man, lan, loves another woman. I'm sorry. That is ridiculous. Him. He is sleeping with Miss Von Durow. They have affair. He's afraid the company... La compagnia? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) He's afraid the compagnia is losing money. Capisce? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Gaetano, that's absurd. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) You know how I loved ELISABETTA. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Don, which one you want me to kill? (SCOFFS) This is insane. He doesn't believe a word of this. To think I spent the last days of my life on Earth raking pebbles. It's a meditation, you told me. I don't know, Jim. I don't think I was cut out for it. While I was raking, the people next door had a Dodgers game on. I went over and listened. I had a couple of cigarettes, too. I kept them hidden in my Rakusu. (SIGHS) I could use one right now. I had this fianc√©e, Deb Tillotson. Why didn't I marry her? Have some kids, jump in the pool. Ah, your dad used to say the same thing to me. Now it's too late. Gautama, he was a spoilt brat, too. He became Buddha. Am I gonna top that? No way. Doesn't matter now, anyway. It's not over yet. That old man's probably killed hundreds of people. But in this case, it's not gonna do his soul much good to kill the wrong guy. (DOOR OPENS) (KATINKA GRUNTS) (SOFTLY) Oh, God! No. No. IAN: Get your hands off me! Sir, I have Miss Von Gaetano. Get off me! The one you wanted. Ian. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Oh, now we're speaking French. Somebody's keeping secrets. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Who cares about the black cloud in your heart? Shut up, Katinka! A spat. That's always sad to see. (GRUNTS) You lay with this man? (CRYING) I betrayed my sweet teacher. My friend. Don Gaetano, you're a civilized man, a European. You know that sometimes a man will take a mistress, but it doesn't mean that the love is less, or certainly that I would, I'd harm a hair on her head. I loved her. Sir, which one you want me to kill? Mr. Fama, this woman... In the death of ELISABETTA, she's innocent. It's the hairdresser's idea. He blamed this man for it because he's a nobody. Uh, you understand? Capisce? PINETREE: Who do you want me to kill? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Please don't kill me. Don't listen to them. Which one should I kill? I didn't kill anybody, I swear! He's innocent. Innocente. Don Gaetano? Sir? (DOCTOR SPEAKING ITALIAN) He's dead. Damn! (KATINKA CRYING) (DOCTOR SPEAKING ITALIAN) Are any of you authorized to pay me if I complete the job? Oh, no, no, no. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Bang, bang! Damn. (YELLING) Damn! Damn! (CRYING) Oh, now, don't look so relieved, lan. It may be over for Don Gaetano, but it's not over for you. ROCKFORD: Get him! Get him, Scotty! I'll get him! (BOTH GRUNTING) I got him, Jim, I got him. Yes, you did. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) As these graduates go forth, we feel certain that they leave here possessing not only the values we've taught them at this institution, but also the values inculcated by family, school, church, by a just and moral society. But a society in which no influence is more important than family. And so, Class of 1996, we salute you. Congratulations. (ALL CHEERING) (ALL APPLAUDING) Yes! Tell me, who would've thought Scotty would become a cop? Funny, it was there all the time, the right thing for him. None of us saw it. Did you see it, Jim? No, I can't say I did. SCOTTY: (LAUGHING) Hey, Jim! BECKER: He's gonna make it this time, don't you think? He's gonna make it.
