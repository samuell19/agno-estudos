Here's is your share. I don't want any part of it. It's cute. There is a story behind this Jade necklace. My grandpa was born in year of the monkey, he had twelve kids. So was my dad too. Naturally, he inherited this Jade necklace. You were born in the year of the monkey too. That's why my dad gave it to me. But he made one condition, if I met the right girl, I must give it to her. Other polices are on the payoff but not you. You're going to die penniless you want my daughter? Show me $50,000 you are looking down on me. You have nothing. This is all I have, how about it? Stand with your legs apart. Don't say I didn't give you a chance. First you kneel down, and apologize to bing. Then you crawl between his legs. Finally, you'll make amends with a feast tomorrow. After that we can consider the slate clean. Let your mother crawl between that guy's legs. Didn't you say I am your boyfriend? Yes. Call me darling. Darling. Can't hear you! Darling. Please help me! Pay your respects to Mr. ngan. Are you dumb? Take a drink. Cliff, the sergeant major for yaumatei, retired. A power struggle emerged between Lee Rick and ngan tung in order to get to the top. Ngan tung established close ties with Hong Kong's most powerful underworld figures. I'm just beginning to learn from you to see how you get ahead. If you don't teach me some tricks, I can't win. I am afraid I am a washout. Only a matter of time before you bound back. Brother ho. When you're in the seat of yaumatei district, then we can sit down and talk. Who need you then? I am going out. Go to find some trustable guys around him. What he does, who he sees. Which hookers he has been? I want to know everything. Right away. Mommy, what's that word? It's the character "sword" Thank you would you like to order some drinks? I like wine, please. What a lovely child. Where are you living? My factory gave me a room to live. Did he go to school now? We just struggle in from mainland. Didn't find the school yet. Is his father still in China? Hsien â€œwhat? Come here. Tell him your name? My name is Lee chuy hsien. How old are you? Seven my surname is Lee too. For my whole life, I'd only with one man. Sorry, I'm married. I can guess. I know what I would do. - Do you want to say? - None of my business. None of your business... Shit, I'll kill you. Finish? Not yet. Why don't you call me earlier? I can arrange another person to admit it. You should know the boss is interviewing for the promotion. - The result is not yet announce. - Not yet. Bring him out. Come, bring him out. Go to hell. Why are you so stubborn, how much is he going to give you? Don't know. The bank reported for ten thousand dollars lose. Divide by four, the best you can get is three thousand. If you were caught, all the money will be gone. You can't ever get the three thousand. If you tell us the names, and we caught them. Ever you're in jail, I, Lee rock pay you five thousand. No matter which jail you are in. The five thousand with you anywhere you go, how about that? Don't waste your time. I won't sell my pals for five thousand. Six thousand? Forget it. I'd sworn with my pals seven thousand? We did all the things together. Eight thousand? Should know the pals since we came out to struggle. Nine thousand? If you were caught, will your pals save you? Ten thousand, the highest. Your came out to Rob the bank just for ten thousand? Don't waste my time. Just speak it out, or I'll change my mind. Don't be foolish, I'm a straight guy. Nine thousand? You ask me to be a informer, you better ask me to get kill. Eight thousand? How can I face my old pals? Seven thousand? That's enough, officer, don't do it. Then tell me the truth. You just said you'd pay ten thousand. Ten thousand can do it. Do you really mean it? Are you first time heard my name? I said what I mean. - Son of the bitch. - What? I mean I am a bitch thanks. Brother rock - what? I heard ngan tung's people had bought a lot of people to admit the crimes. I won't do this kind of cheap shots. So? Ming, bring the chair over here. Sit, brother rock. Ming, he was from your yaumatei. We were pals, you can trust him. Brother rock if you need any help, just call me. Come thank you I need a list of all the underground owners. And the list of all the gangsters in that area. Plus inside those areas, how many drugs, gamble spots and whore house and all the underground prostitute spots. Check it all out for me. I need some cash flow. How much? Two thousand will be enough. I'll give you four thousand first. But do remember, give me all the information within a week. All the information must be accurate. Sure, sure What a beautiful scene! I must say it seams to be doing very well. In fact, I never see amaze your ability. N.T. I think I'll do it better if I am in right corner, sir. But the question is which corner. I won't worry about it, n.T. I am sure you'll get exactly way where you want to go. Shall I take this as a promise? You had my word. Thank you. Sir. But the way, n.T. Will you be attending the races in happy valley on Sunday? Yes, I'll. Do you care to join my wife and I on our box? It will be my honor, sir. I am very glad actually, you see. Because there are several interesting horses running. Ngan tung set up a dinner party in peninsula hotel. He invited all the foreign officers. That's the trick of buying out their heart. If I were them, I'll enjoy it too. Go to the party first, drink Brandy like tea. And the movie star dance with them. After the party, go up stair to sleep with them. Brother rock, we can use the same trick too. Since ngan tung can buy them the wine and girls, we can play with the same game. He gave them one girl each, I'll give them a couple. One stone for two birds you know about the girls. Man likes to play with two girls at a time. Do you agree? Have some fruits. Thank you. Brother rock, this son of the bitch's idea sounds great. Brother rock brother rock what did you say? Nothing, nothing When are you going to pick her? How should we call each other? I think she is not an aggressive person. I am not aggressive too I didn't mean it, from the day I knew you. I know you are not that kind of picky lady. Tell me frankly, besides her, have you ever love any other girls before? Come closer, I'll tell you. Say it. I only have her. Rock, if you marry her, she is not allowed to come in my room. Whatever you did, I don't mind I don't want to pip at you. Don't worry, I'll choose a room farther away. I won't bother you then. No way, you two better remember. Don't ever wake me up. That's impossible when we are making love without any noise. I don't care, no noise at all. Ah hsiun, thank you. What? The color is too bright. Not bright, - special report just right - for the wedding. - Government just announced from now on, all the married man's title. Only one wife's name is allowed. Or will be sued for the double marriage suit. All the double marriage's men will be violated the law in Hong Kong afterwards double marrigae is forbidden yesterday, Hong Kong government announced to abandon the ching dynasty's rule. From now on, one man for one wife. Had all the government officers start the action first. This is ah hsiun. Please come in have a seat. Tea, please. Don't be like this. No, please drink it. It's all my fault, I didn't come to break your marriage. Don't be misunderstood me, I didn't come to blame on you. - Up please. - You drink it first. Mother No matter what happen, you drink it first.

Kid just afraid of new face. Come hsien, go play over there Before I met you, I always feel... You are the third person between me and rock. Rock gave you the Jade necklace. It proved he really love you. I knew, you're very sad they abandoned the rule. But you should know, one man for one wife, even the governor had to obey it. I think rock will be very sorry too. I never blame on rock. Really? This time I come to Hong Kong, of course I want to see him. When he came to my house to see me at the old days. But I never had a chance to meet him. For so many years, I was worried about this. Don't know it will hurt him or not. Now I've met rock, in such good life. I am very satisfy of it. I never have any idea to disturb his life. Don't worry, hsiun, I decided to leave him alone. I didn't come to force you to leave. I didn't mean it. It's not you, but it's my fate to force me. Ah har, hsien, come to help father. Ah har, hisen ah har Brother rock, when you read this letter. Hsien and I had left already don't try to find us. We just don't have good fate to be together. Since the god means it, it doesn't mean anything for me to stay. Take good care Rock - what? - Nothing - nothing? - Nothing. Rock, I didn't study very much, I am not good in speaking. But the old folks had said, how much can a person eat or dress. It is all fates that he had how many children and wife. Just like I used to be very poor. How do I expect to be so...? Any action over there? Nothing how about ming? How does he check on yaumatei area? The list is on ah kuan's hand. - Please have a seat. - Brother rock - what? - I don't want to go I, I want to go home. - What? - Nothing, I just want to go home earlier. What? Something must be happened. Ngan tung. Yaumatei's drug dealer gave him three million dollars. To buy that position for him. Smart I've think it over, we can get one million dollar but the worst is... He had talked it over with those drug dealers already. Why don't you tell me earlier? I just don't think... Why don't you tell me earlier? Rock, since it can't be change, I don't want to hurt your feeling. Sam - yes contact fan liany's sergeant liu immediately. And yuen long's kuan to meet me three days from now. Sergeant will have a meeting with us right the way. Do it, quick Let me tell you, I never believe in fate. I only believe what belongs to me will be mine. Since you want to beat up ngan tung, the commissioner is the key person. What else is the problem? Just buy him out. The problem is... That guy was bought by ngan tung already. What else can I do? You'd be a police for so many years. This way can't through, you can go for the other way. Just only a foreigner, you can't even handle him. I know the only secret. The commissioner's wife is a famous gambler in Macau. Last month she'd lost lot of money. You can go from this way, if you need any money. I can give all my money for you. You can pay me back when you have. I just pretend to bet a lot of money on you. How's that? Lost, she had lost over eight thousand. Give her twenty thousand. Give it to her for me. This is from Mr. rock over there. Tell her. Mr. rock wants to make sure your husband reads this report. So why don't you give it to him yourself. You see him everyday at the station. Well, Mr. rock doesn't want to take any chance. He knows the commissioner is a busy man. It's up to you to impress on him this report is the highest priority. Tell her, this is the gift for her from me. This is a token of his appreciation. Alan darling, what're you doing here? I want to show you something. Can I have it later? I'm busy. No, it's very important. No, read it now. The man we selected is ability qualified both in terms of experience and ability. The commissioner is very glad to announce about the position of yaumatei area. He had chose a very appropriate person. I introduced to you the new sergeant major of yaumatei district, Mr. ngan tung. Sergeant ngan tung will be the new chief of yaumatei area. - Thanks, thanks... - Congratulation, congratulation... Let's cheer for sergeant ngan. Quiet, please. I had another important announcement to make. There has been a high level decision to create a new post, chief of sergeant majors. Now the high level decision will create a new post, chief of sergeant majors. The new chief will be responsible for all the Chinese detectives in the colony. They will answer directly to him. He and he alone will be responsible for all work agreements. Chief of sergeant majors in charge of all Chinese sergeant majors in the colony. He alone will be responsible for all work assignments. And in charge of all the arrangements. Gentleman, I would like to introduce you the new chief of sergeant majors. Mr. Lee rock Mr. Lee rock. Congratulation, congratulation... Congratulation, open the champagne. Chief Lee, congratulation for you to be the chief. Please take care of us from now on. Thank you come, let's cheer for chief Lee. Thank you, all of you. Please remember be, thank you chief Lee. My congratulations thank you, sir. Now I'll directly in charge. Every week each district goes to their own area to collect the money. Sir have a seat, n.T. Thank you, sir I hope besides the people who collect the money. No one will allow asking for the money. Besides, all the spots pay a flat rate. Any private sports, movable spots and the relatives owned spots will be picked. According to my estimate, the daily income is around five hundred eighty thousand. Hundred and eighty thousand were from yaumatei area. All the money being collected the share will like this. The commissioners and I got thirty percent, twenty percent to the sergeants, ten percent for the officers, half percent for the detectives. There is only sixty five percent, the rest... The rest is to all polices. I calculate very accurate with the interests. I think it won't affect your benefits. This sounds very great. The local's money and interest to set up different types of business. For example like mongkok, there can have ten gamble and drug stations. But it will be different in Sam shui po. It can only afford five gamble houses and seven drug stations. The reason is... When there are over crowded stations, it will get tough competition. It will cause a lot of fighting. My only request is all of you obey what I arranged. Try the best way to control his area. If someone is breaking the rule, better not let me find it, specially for those leaders. If they make any mistake, they will be punished too. In the near future, I'll definitely trust. The future of the police will be very excited. That's all what I want to say, thank you. N.t. Do you say any hope in this? No, sir. Good, because I hope that you and everyone have supported this whole heartly. It requests nothing less than totals commitment in order to success. Commissioner hope we can work it out in more boat. Under this new rule, I take it that you admire sergeant Lee's new proposal. Is this correct, n.T.? Yes, sir. Then you'll work hand in hand with him in this. I'll, sir. I am glad to hear it actually. Chief sergeant major the biggest underground rice importer am I? Yeah, rock's order. Only four families were in drug business. Brother hau take in charge of mongkok area. The rest families were in Hong Kong side, Kong family. Eastside belongs to potato head. One in kowloon side, one in new territories. How can compete with you? Am I right? Chief sergeant major, there are over hundred drug retailers. You can cut it down to only four. You really have guts. What a clever mind! You didn't disappoint me. From now on, my income... Will always have a share for you. Thanks - besides, inside my area, if you need any help from me, like any criminals that you want to catch, just give me the name, I'll handle it. Come... cheer. Brother hau is really a guy. I represent all polices in Hong Kong thanks to you. I represent my fellows. We are on the same standpoint, cheer. Come, cheer. Cheer, better go and drink it with the mirror. Sam, who are those guys? He is in charge this area. Invite him come over a minute? I see. What? Chief Lee wants to talk with you. Brother rock chief Lee you like to show your gun out? No, sorry sir. I don't understand english. Sorry, chief Lee. Tell your boss tomorrow morning. You volunteer to transfe rback to the uniform cop. You can show your gun on the street for three months. Please forgive me, chief Lee. Go! You are so cold blood. Come, brother hau drink it. Hsiu fan's song is getting better. Yellow wolf... Don't escape, that's him. Stop, don't run. Try to rape me, catch him. You fucking son of the bitch dare try to rape her here, you are looking for trouble. I didn't... You didn't ever try to do it in the other spot. No... Stop, stop. Hand it to the officer. Who are you? We are from the gamble house of brother wah. - We had paid the money for the month. - Yeah I saw you were catching people. I came down to help you, am I wrong? Thanks - don't mention. It is our job to work with the police. Right, right! Officer, walk carefully if you need any help, just call us anytime. Happy to work with you any time. Lee is promoted to chief of sergeant majors. He sets up a new system of pay-off. The underworld vies for his favours, as his power increases, ngan tung's prestige suffers a serious blow. Many gangs refuse to continue paying him off. This intensifies the enmity between Lee and himself where is your boss? That guy names fire dragon, son of the bitch. All the shark loaners were ran away ngan, don't worry. I'll catch them tonight. Don't be too angry, think it clearly angry! We had said when the stuff from Thailand was arrived my pier. I can have as many as I want. Now you gave it to that son of the bitch. Even if I find the client, I don't have any stuff for him. He forced me to do it. Whatever you like, I'll back you up. But tell you before, nothing related to me. Don't worry, wait for my good news. Brother, let me do it. You are so dumb, dare want to go to Holland. Shit, he is in luck Fire dragon! What law did he break? He, he is peeping in the washroom. Peeping? What are you yelling at? I hate this kind of people the most, get in. Wait for me to teach you a lesson. Fire dragon. Let me take care of him. Whatever you say. Miss, are you a police? No, what's the matter? My wallet was stolen, I came for the report. I had waited for ten minutes, but no police is around. I think maybe they are busy. Wait over here. I ask them to come out. No money share it. I told you don't over ask me on this. You just do whatever you decide. Fine, that's it. Are you tired? You shock me, have a seat. Every night you are so busy. After tonight, you can say whatever you want to go tomorrow night. Don't promise too early. What kind of soup is this? You like it the most, abalone and chicken soup. Come, drink it first. Where is Sam and kun, where are they? They might be in business, and went out. No wonder I don't see anyone in the front entrance. None of them yeah impossible Stop, who ask you in? Sergeant, are you alright? Brother rock, are you fine? Are you okay? Rock Brother rock, are you there? What's the matter? I went home, my wife and child were all disappear. My home was empty. Your home's air is not good, they went for the fresh air. This is normal. Impossible, rice was cooked but the fire is still on. The next door said they saw someone kidnapped them away. Sam, help me check it out. Let me check who want to buy rock's life case first. And then we will find your folks back. Even it is dead body. Damn it, your whole family was all died. Are they enjoying in Macau? It is time to bring them back. Is it any words want to say with me? We help each other, right? Quick, don't let him run away stop, don't run... Over here. Ngan, help me. What are you doing? Police will get lots of enemy. Can't relax even you are in the toilet. Especially with those unnoticed places and peoples. They will kill you. Just like your best pal-the king crab. Don't talk about this subject around. I am not king crab's pal. I just happened to know him. He dared to try to kill rock, he is doomed. You must be happy since he is dead. It is too bad. Not everyone want me to die. They all should die, right? Now you are so famous, who dare to touch you? Don't worry too much. Look at the mirror. Don't be so serious, let me ask you. Look at both of our faces, who will live longer? You look so handsome. You will live longer than me. Since you don't look better than me. Be careful, I hope you live over hundred years old. Gangland activities reach a peak, Lee not only becomes one of Hong Kong's biggest vips, his personal fortune skyrockets come on do it. He is Chinese god. His name is Mr. guan, come on.

Nightclub used to be the best business. Property is the best this year. You made five million dollars for the first three months. Really, only in real estate? So, concentrate on it. But don't drop off the nightclub business. I know. Have something to eat. Morning, sir London assigns Scott to be Hong Kong's new commissioner of police Be seat Back in London, I was impressed with Hong Kong's reputation as a land of marvels. No natural resources, but a flourishing economy an understaffed police force but a surprising high percentage of case solved commissioner is kind of suspecting in London Hong Kong's crime rate can be solved so fast. But since assuming my post as commissioner my impression has drastically changed. It changed his mind when he was in Hong Kong now. The fact is Hong Kong is a hotbed of criminal activities. Commissioner said Hong Kong is an evil city. Sergeant Lee, do you agree? He asked detective Lee agree or not? No comment well then my primary targets are criminating vice, gambling and drugs. Commissioner's first priority is to destroy drug gamble and prostitute Mr. Lee I expect you to lead the blitz against these three evils. You want to challenge? Commissioner said he wanted to see the real action very soon. Drug, gamble and prostitute detective Lee, any problem? Of course no problem, this is our duty to clean it off. Translator, please tell commissioner. I am cooking a bowl of soup. If there is no more things I'll go home and check on my soup I had to leave sure, see you later if you have time, have a drink in my home. As a new officer, if not working hard, then he must be out of his mind. Dame it, forget about him. He wants to have his power. Then let's get some people to act for him. Tell those people line up. Wait us to arrest them. Everything will be fine. But it is not that easy this caucasion is very clever. If we gave him the ordinary people, that will give him the evidence. Then we will be in trouble damn it, ask him to take away the Chinese god's joss. Change another for me. Ask all the gamble spots to stop ten working days let me have a big clean up I'll arrest anyone if they are still in business. Brother rock, this is serious. Ten days for nothing. Those addicts will come out and complain. Plus, those people had no income at all. They will be in trouble right, brother rock then the foreigners will clean us out. What do your mean? What did you say? Try to clean us all. Nothing, just help me print a newsletter. Criticize the society's dark side, more critical. How do you explain that? The newspaper is kept on criticize that police can't control the security.. Commissioner asked me why you can't control the crimes? Translate it for me we had all our manpower to clean off the drugs, gamble and prostitute. No enough people to control the crime it's very hard to work. That is not excuse. He is right, this is not an excuse. But that is the fact, it's the truth. Tell him, delay the action. Get all the manpower to control the crime. I can guarantee everything will get peace within two week. S Yeah, I am cooking the red bean soup at home if there is nothing, I will leave now. Wait until your decision, call me up. I'll wait for you - How are you... - How are you... Let me introduce you, this is sergeant Lee rock this is miss ting ting. Well, Mr. Norman it looks as the other unofficial commissioner of police is far more influential and popular than you the official one. I don't believe that is too funny as far as the British government or I is concerned. What do you think, bill? Is he admirable? - In the way. - Yes, I think you are right. For someone who has managed the mastermind such an engineer system of paid off has 90% of the police forces on the take and has managed to keep the whole thing going for so long. Yes, I think he is admirable in a perverse sort of way. Cheers brother, he is charter I like to introduce my assistant, bill. Bill, this is Sara hello - nice to meet you. This is my niece, estella hello, how do you do? I think I let you friend for yourself. Ladies, would you come with me? There is someone you would like to meet. Mr. Carter, allow me to introduce to you sergeant Lee. Of course, I know sergeant Lee. I heard Mr. Carter is coming to take over the anti-corruption department. Is it the truth? Your detective work is most impressive, Mr. Lee. But in fact, you're wrong. The anti-corruption branch you did because is so completely that unmanageable. I'm setting a new outfit that guarantee to do the job the anti-corruption branch fail to do. Good idea, but if we had a new one. How about those old people where will they do? To the political department. That is a brilliant idea. Corruption and sordidness go hand in hand with politics. Mr. Carter is very funny. Inform me if you really need any help. All my people is very trustable. If you need them, any time I can recommend fifty for you. Thank you Mr. Lee. If it's offer, I definitely keep in mind. Excuse me, I must go. Nice to meet you. My pleasure, Mr. Lee excuse me. Sorry, excuse me. Stand If you are a Chinese, why did you help those foreigners? I heard that commissioner is a foreigner too. Very good in speech, from London or Australia? Australia, how do you know? Your boss is hiring a lot of peoples from england and Australia. If you use your mind, you should know it, right? Too bad, if you had a little justice in your heart, Hong Kong will become a peace land. Now is a happy land too. Only it belongs to me. It is a shit place, you made it like shit. Don't dare to say that. Shut up. He looks like the one I used to be. What is your name? If you don't mind, come to my department. This is my name card. Excuse me. His surname is Lee too. How long did they come back? Almost a year. - One year? - Yes! At last I found her. A lady who worked in the laundry at China town, raise her son, and let him finish the college education. It's not easy, brother rock. Mother, let's go. Hsien, he's your father. This is the fact, it can't change. For you and the whole society, he is dangerous, this is the fact too. Mr. Lee, no matter what happen I had to do it for personal or justice. It's so exciting. Hsien, you can't. You want to kill your father. You want to even qualified, kid. Mr. Lee, evil can never win over the justice. I think you forget this so long. Don't be too proud of your self. I'll arrest you one day by myself. Hsien ah har - mother mother... get away. Quick, call the ambulance. - What's wrong with her? - Get away what's wrong with her? Doctor - go and see stop, don't follow me or I'll take action on you. Listen, I am her direct relative, you had nothing related to her. I had the right to stop you interrupted her. Listen to me, go talk with the judge department. I am going to see her, no one can stop me. Sergeant is not so great, sue me for attacking the police. - You dare to attack your father. - None of your business what? This is hospital, don't fight here. Sergeant Lee, what's wrong? Nothing, go out, go out. Always against your father your mother never say don't want to see him. Listen to me... Don't argue with them, listen to me first. Think about it, if har wake up and know we are in quarrel. It will hurt her heart, right? Listen to me, take good care of your mother. If anything happened, I won't let you go free hand.. Take good care of my wife. I'll, I'll. - I'll leave now, but remember if anything happened, do call me. What are you starring at me for? I am your uncle, want to beat me up. What's happen? Nothing, nothing Today the commissioner will give out two merits for two outstanding polices. The first is the juvenile criminal department had a very good result to control it, Mr. lam kung. Sergeant lam, please. - Thank you, sir. - Well done the second one to win this merit is smart and clever to clean off the crimes, Mr. Lee rock sergeant Lee, please. Thank you, sir - well done Sir, Mr. Lee's award-winning days are numbered. It may take a few years, but we're confident that I.C.A.C. Will put an end to corruption in this society... At least where the police force is concerned. We won't let you down, sir. If we want to beat Lee rock, it is going to take a bit of political intrigue. Well, that's one area we British do excel. Commissioner said, due to the shortage of police force, the governor is serious in consideration. In a very time, to hire more police man power, so they will change the original system. For example, every area now had only one Chinese sergeant can hire three of them to support each other. That means we'll hire a lot of people. Furthermore, in recognition of his outstanding contribution as a police officer, sergeant major Lee will be promoted to inspector. - Congratulation, sergeant Lee. - Besides, the governor is very impressed the performance of sergeant Lee rock. He will promote sergeant Lee to become inspector Lee. In addition, inspector Lee will join a provisional committee for the assessment of police supplies. In the mean time, Mr. Lee will take charge more works. He will be assigned a special inspection team to work with three police head to renew the police office new army equipment. How long do I have to work on it? He wants to know how long he will be with this group. About six months - how about your old job? - About six months officer Lee's present job, sergeant lam and sergeant ngan will be charged. One, two, three, four, five... My godless, jail again? Jail again! Rock, I was so mad on those guys. They said if those shares are not going to split into three. They will clean our spots. Before the promotion, those two kids treat us like father. As I said, each area with three sergeants is to target you fight for the share. Trust me, this is only the beginning. Brother rock, only this small part if everyone of us come out to pee, the icac will be flooded. It won't be so afraid. I am afraid ngan will take advantage at this time. He is going to revenge just like this, brother rock. We want to ask you to come and take the lead. No, I just received a letter from them. They approved my retirement. And listen to me. If nothing happen, go with me. Brother rock, don't mention this. Tell us when you are leaving. Let us know, we will have a farewell party with you. Come, drink the tea. Today is the l.C.A.C. Foundation day. We have interviewed Mr. Keith about the characteristic of the l.C.A.C.. The I.C.A.C. Commissioner Mr. Keith says the l.C.A.C. Is under the direct control of the governor and its goals are to totally uproot corruption from Hong Kong society. The vase majority of Hong Kong citizens want their society to be run on the principles of law order and equality. He appeal to all citizens who are being victimized or who have knowledge of corruption to come forward and report these crimes. He promised all information are absolutely confidential. I told you to send the money to Canada, how is it? Those cashes were all there. And the nightclubs and restaurants, plus the properties were all in process. When everything is done, you should come. I know brother rock, kuan still doesn't want to leave. I have told them so many times. They can't look down the British government. The old anti-corruption department accepts the money from us. Now the icac is directly reported to the queen. I think no more excuse can be arranged. I am very worry. If they won't leave now, they will be caught some day. Talk to them when you have time come, let's celebrate Mr. ngan promoted to sergeant major. Cheer, cheer, brothers... From now on, Mr. ngan should take care of us.
