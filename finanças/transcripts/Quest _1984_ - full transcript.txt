Before the gate was closed, and the light began to fail. The Ancients lived a long and fruitful life. Now our lifespan is eight days. Yes, for us there is no time. The minutes, the hours and the days fly away and our lives along with them. Again. Again. Well, is this the one? It's too early to tell. It's too soon, wait. We don't have time to wait. Yes, we must chance it. Look at his hand. Does he have the line? Yes. The line is strong. He sees! Already. That's early. He hears us too. He understands. He's a good choice. It is decided. The teaching must begin at once. As we watch you grow, change. As you watch us, we grow old. Your life, like ours, is destined to be short. In eight days we're born, mature, we grow old and die. Is this the one? One day from now you'll be a grown boy. Two or three, young man. Five, middle aged. Seven, old. In eight days, you'll stop and die. Listen to our hearts race. Listen to your own heart race. We are locked away on a world where our lives speed through time in eight days. No time to see, to feel. To know. It's time. Now the teaching begins. Listen to them. Learn quickly little one. It's time for you to go. That light squeezes through the crack where the doors of the Great Gate join. That gate must be opened. You will open it. Beyond the gate is a land where life is lived for 20,000 days and more. If the gate can be reached and opened, the light will rush out over us and with it bring long life, and peace. But why have I been chosen? Those who were sent before left when they were too old. They died before they reached the gate. This time we have chosen someone young. You. You've learned your lessons quickly. You're strong and intelligent. You have curiosity. Have I learned enough? We don't have time to teach you anymore. You'll have to learn the rest on the way. Mother. Goodbye. Go on. Don't hesitate. Don't be afraid. We have prepared you well. Be brave. Hurry, go. No! No, no, no, no, no. No. Straight ahead. You must go there. Move on. You must go on my son. Remember your goal. Move on. So, they sent another one. Let's have a look at you. Yeah you're young. Yes. Much younger than I was when I got here. What happened? Time stopped me. I started too late. But you have a better chance. Look at that pyramid. Don't go around it. You have to climb to the top. Don't be afraid. Not everything that frightens or hurts you is bad. Fear and pain are your teachers. Don't be angry. Learn. Survive. Can I do anything for you? No. My time has passed. There's nothing more for you here. Go on. Go. Your race is with time. You're not alone my son. We travel with you. We travel with you. I'm getting old. I have to hurry. I have to get to the gate. Now! Of all the 20,000 days ahead, which day will be the finest? Which day will be the best? Any day. Any hour. Any minute!
