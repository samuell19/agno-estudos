Well, that's gratitude. I just ran three miles for your stomach. Anything happen? No. I called my roommate for messages. You've been evicted? No. But there was a telegram for me. Your father. Very funny. It was USC. They screened my short on Greenpeace. No shit? Uh uh. So? So, uh, they loved it. I got a three year grant! Oh, god. Really? Yeah. Oh, congratulations, man. That's great. Ingmar, move over. [laughs] Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? That's not all. I've decided to do my first film on you-- Fran Hudson, Nefertiti of the 1900s. [laughs] Mm. The Chevy's back. He's got a woman with him. Yeah. Just like Fargas said. [door closes] Looks like she's carrying a baby. Uh huh. That's right. You really think they got the stuff on them? They better.

What's the big hurry? Oh, Mark. [suspenseful music] Oh, my god. We better go back the way we came. You want to do this? You bet your ass I do. After you. OK. Ready? Go. After weeks of careful investigation, Cable Video News had hoped to bring you an important public service-- eye witness coverage of amajor-- major cocaine bust. This bloodbath, which took placeapproximately 15 minutes ago, appears to be some sort of personal vendetta. The world of drugs is a nightmare. But perhaps the worst nightmareis lived by those who deal, who compete and die for themost profitable consumer item on Earth. No bust will be made. The police may never find out the truth. But the incredible ferocityof what happened here today is truth enough. From South Miami, this isFran Hudson, Cable Video News. Did anything I just said make any sense? Want to know the truth? I didn't hear a word. [sirens in distance] [sighs] That is not the DEA. The kid must have told somebody. If you want this thing aired,we better get out here. Come on. Shit, Mark. Larry's going to kill me. What am I going to do? MARK: Don't worry. You'll think of something. [sirens in distance] Let's hustle. You know, you are really something. How the hell do you stayso calm after having gone through something like that? I'm a reporter, Mark. I can't afford to be squeamish. You know, you flew mangledMarines out of Beirut. You've seen baby seals skinned alive. What are you get so romanticabout all of a sudden, huh? Maybe I'm not bucking for a Pulitzer. [sultry music] Hi, Fargas. Francis. - Hey, you got a minute? - Yeah. For you, sure. Anything. But this isn't a suitableplace for a lady. Make history. Be my guest. So what can I get you? Those Colombians, a half an hour ago? It was a butcher shop. Have you heard about it? Yeah. It's on the grapevine. Did you make it in time? Yeah. More or less. [laughs] Three weeks ago in New York, and then again in New Orleans. And the same thing last week in Chicago. Somebody gets his rocks offslicing up these pushers. But nobody knows what's happening. Swear. Take a look at this. "To my little Rita, [inaudible] April '84." So? So who are they? I don't know. I've never seen them before. Where did you get this? In that apartment today. I got it out of a woman's handbag. They cut her to ribbons. Now, come on. Come on, Fargas. Fill me in. Sweetheart, even I have my limits. I'm only interested in this man here. This guy here with the white hair. Now, I think he's American. $200. [laughs] Look, I could just die at the thought of losing that kind of money. But I'm no gravedigger. FRAN: What do you mean? Exactly what I say. Graves are for dead people. Keep talking. [laughs] Come on. Guyana, six years ago. It was a big stink. Yeah. Guyana, Jonestown. What's the connection? Don't you like puzzles? If you think of anythingelse, give me a call, all right? Yeah. Uh, Francis, this puzzle is pretty heavy. [sirens in distance] REPORTER [ON TV]: Jim Jones,interviewed by NBC newsman Don Harris, showed signs of strain, of concern over the adverse publicitythe visit would bring. JIM JONES [ON TV]: I justpray you please leave us. [inaudible] We won't bother nobody. Anybody who wants to get outof here can get out of here. REPORTER [ON TV]: After the visitors left with a group of defectors,Jones apparently ordered their deaths. The attack came at a nearby airstrip as the Ryan party got readyto board two airplanes. Gunmen suddenly appeared-- [sighs] [door opens] Hi. They're pretty grainy. I pushed them as far as I could. What did they think of the footage? They loved it. It's on in an hour. Oh, my god. [sighs] Look at that. Tell me what you see. What am I supposed to see? Look at the kid. MARK: Tommy Allo? FRAN: Yeah. MARK: You mean Bob's kid? The kid's a look alike. Jesus Christ. Why are you doing this? It's OK, hon. Who are these otherpeople in this photograph? OK. I want to show you something first. [clatter] OK. Now watch this. REPORTER [ON TV]: Jim Jones,interviewed by NBC newsman Don Harris, showed signs of strain, of concern over the adverse publicitythe visit would bring. JIM JONES [ON TV]: I justbeg you, please leave us. [inaudible] We won't bother nobody. Anybody who wants to get outof here can get out of here. REPORTER [ON TV]: After the visitors left with a group of the-- All right. Now look at the man on the left. BOB ALLO: Who is he? FRAN: That is Brian Horne,Green Beret Colonel in Vietnam, dishonorably discharged in '74, became Jones' right hand man in '75. A lot of people think theGuyana massacre was his idea. Well, it looks like the same guy to me. Yeah? - Yeah. Without a doubt. So? So Bryan Horne was supposed to have died in '78 in the massacre. And that picture was taken three months ago. Bryan Horne, It's quite a story. It's what you'rethinking about, isn't it? Yeah. I want to find Horne and interview him. And take a look at thislook alike while I'm in it. Where would you start? If I were going to do it, I'd start with the markings on the plane. You're on assignment, Fran. Congratulations. Thanks. How soon can you leave? Um, well, if-- if you'llcheck the plane markings with the FAA, I'm gone. [laughs] I guess all Ineed now is the equipment and a good cameraman. You don't think for a minute I'd ever let you go down there alone, do you? No. [laughs] [indistinct conversation] Hi, excuse me. We're looking for apilot named Tony Martina. Yeah? What do you want him for? We have a little proposition for him. Well, you can tell me. I'm a friend of his. If I see him, I'll pass it on. Listen, could we talk this over in private? Get yourself a cup of coffee, huh? All right. [engine starts] Well, what's your proposition? Uh, well, first of all,I'm Fran and I'm a reporter. And this is Mark. He's my cameraman. And you are Tony Martina,owner of this plane. [laughs] So what if I am? We'd like to go where this was taken. Oh, yeah? Why? We want to interview this man, Colonel Horne. [dramatic music] [gunfire] [thud] [panting] You can thank god you're white. [thud] Back to Colonel. [indistinct conversation] Hey, ain't these somefinger-licking good babies? You only got two? Well, these are good sized,but how are you going to feed 40 people with it? Well, I cut them into eensy-teensy pieces. Hey, hey. Give me that. You asshole. Hey, don't you guys ever work? Why should we? We got you. [indistinct conversation] Down on your knees. You got a job to do. Manuel is due any minute. You go get your clipboard. And if you try that again,I'll shoot you in your legs. And I'll make you crawl back. All right? Move. Move! Move! [indistinct conversation] Move your ass, Carlos. We got two shipments to get out. Tony's coming in tonight. [indistinct conversation] ANA: I told you you'd never make it that way. Yeah? Well, at least I tried. And I'll keep on trying. That bastard will have tokill me to keep me here. You're so pig headed. I know how you feel. I felt the same. [sighs] But, in the end, I just gave up. No. There's got to be another way out. [thud] There is. [airplane engine droning] [non-english speech] Anaconda here. Anaconda here. I read you. Go ahead. Over. MAN [OVER RADIO]: Two reports.

How much am I taking? 200 pounds. Is that all? What is it to you? Ah, it's a mess up there. New York is full of the stuff. Only it's not ours. Nobody knows where it comes from. In Miami, Chicago, New Orleans,11 of our men, and nobody knows who did it. Somebody knocked offGonzalez's casino last week. Not a soul left alive. 300 pounds of stuff. [laughs] So what the fuck is going on? [sighs] I have an idea. What? Ah, no. It's just an idea. I hope I'm wrong. Come on. Get the plane unloaded. Move! Vamanos! [non-english speech] Well, I got three hours. What can you offer me? Nothing but the best. Gin, whiskey, water, champagne, water. All right. Oh, pate, smoked salmon,Virginia ham, beans. You name it. Hey, muchacho. You remember what you promised last time? Cabron, [non-english speech]. Si. [door opens] Hey. My friend, Manuel, he wants you. You didn't hear me? Then why didn't you say something? What? [laughs] Thank you, Vlado. Thank you, Vlado. - [laughs] - Ah! You see? I am good to my friends. Mickey called. Rita's group has been wiped out. Manuel should hold the stuff in Puerto Rico. Is that all? That's all. My little Rita? Ah, fuck it. Fuck her. Fuck her till she screams. [door closes] [airplane engine droning] How much farther? Take it easy. The Amazon starts down there. He means we've got time. Why don't you get a little sleep? [groans] [dramatic music] [sighs] Muchas gracias. [door closes] [pensive music] [water running] [non-english speech] [door opens] Wait! Don't go. I, uh, I didn't mean to bother you. You never bothered me. What can I do for you? Well, I saw Manuel leaving and, uh-- Oh. [sighs] Don't punish yourself. Mind your own business! [non-english speech] [sobs] I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Juanito-- Juanito, [non-english speech],, he was like you. One day, he disobeyed. And Vlado-- since then, I don't care any more! I'm a stone, an old shoe! A nothing! No. No, you're not. [sighs] If you were, you wouldn't have done all you've done for me these past few months. [sighs] You're the onlything that's kept me going. Really? Yeah. So that's why I want you tocome with me on that plane tonight, OK? I can't. If Vlado finds out that youhelped me, he'll kill you. But where do I go? I'll help you. Look, my father will help you. [sighs] Oh, god. How do I make you understand? Thanks. Thanks anyway for saying it. [sighs] [airplane engine droning] I better turn on the beacon for Tony. [sighs] We got it. That beacon's going to takeus right into the airfield. Is it far? Oh, I reckon about 30 minutes. What kind of lightningare they going to give you? [laughs] Just a few smudge pots along the runway. [airplane engine droning] Where did you get that? It was Juanito's. It's time to go light the fires. OK. How do we do this? Tony and Vlado will go fora drink before they load. They always do. That's when you climb in and hide. You mean "we." We'll see. They may not be room. There will be room. Let's go. Come on. [twigs cracking] Hey, Brown. Hey, Brown. Do you hear me? This is Epstein. Do you read me? Ana? Epstein here. It's Epstein, Ana. Come in, will you? [thud] Ana, can you hear me? Come in, Ana. [clatter] Christ! What? What's the matter? The signal's gone. This is Red Bronco calling Anaconda. Do you read me, Ana? Over. Red Bronco calling Anaconda. Do you read me, Ana? Over. [airplane engine droning] Come in, Anaconda. Do you read me? Red Bronco calling Anaconda. Over. [suspenseful music] Do you read me? MAN [OVER RADIO]: This is Donald. What's up? Christ, nobody was answering. Everything quiet your way? MAN [OVER RADIO]: Like a tomb. Over and out. [sighs] [suspenseful music] [thud] [liquid sloshing] [indistinct conversation] [whistles] Hey. We need another one. I'll go and see if that [inaudible] has got the shipment ready. Without that signal, I can't find the airstrip. We're running on minimum fuel, too. Is it your electricalcircuit or their transmitter? What the fuck difference does it make? If it's them, they'll know it. They'll at least light the runway for you. They'll light the fires anyway. Trouble is, we're in the middle of mountains. Manuel, we're being hit. Get your guns. Christ, the plane is on the strip. Wait. [suspenseful music] [whoosh] Ah! [groans] [whoosh] Ah! [whoosh] [gunfire] Come on, you bastards! Get back inside! Get back in! Move it! Get back in! [gunfire] Get back in, you-- [door closes] What's that? Well, it sure ain't firecrackers. What do we do now? Look, I've got to getthe rest of these fires lit or Tony will never make it in. You just stay here. I'll be back as soon as I can. [flames crackling] Get the door. I'm going out the back. [suspenseful music] [flames crackling] [screams] [gunfire] [screams] [dramatic music] Tommy? Ana? [flames crackling] Tommy? [suspenseful music] [screams] There! Over there! About time. We've got six minutes of fuel left. Goddammit! They did one row. How the fuck do I know if the runway is on the right or the left? [airplane engine droning] [sighs] [sighs] Well, flying can be fun. A breath of fresh air, and thenI don't know how he does it, but Vlado has got the coldestbeer in South America. [screams] FRAN: What's wrong? Oh, Jesus Christ! Sh! Move back. Go, go! Stay away from the windows. We will be on monitor nine. Time yet? Not quite. Get me that [inaudible]. Yeah. You never asked me howmuch all this is costing me. Think positive. Look at calculators, in twoyears, they'll be down to $9.95 apiece. We'll have the satellitein three minutes, if they're on schedule. [birds cawing] We're alive by a miracle. We've been hiding in the jungle all night. Dawn broke about two hours ago. Sorry. Um, I'm still here. As I was saying-- Did you see that? FRAN: --broke about two hours ago. Since then, we've beenlooking for signs of life. All we've found so far, however, are corpses. As we hope you've been able tosee, a number of the victims have been horribly mutilated. The stench is terrible. Our pilot was killed right in the cockpit. Anyway, it all points to an attack by the Indios. Besides these, there are many more dead. In here, there doesn'tappear to be any more bodies. However, the place is totally devastated. Here's what appears to besome sort of a shipping list, although I'm not sure exactly for what. And this is what remains of the radio. It, too, has been completely destroyed. As to the motivation of this attack-- [door opens] [screams] That's Vlado. And this is Colonel Horne. You know this man? He came here twice. Where is he now? Tommy. Tommy. Tommy! Out there, did you see a blond boy? FRAN: Wait a minute. Um, is that Tommy? Yes. That's him. And he was here? Yes, but last night he disappeared. We found him. Mark, we actually found him. No, Fran. We haven't found him. We only know he was here. So we can look for him. The plane, can you fly it? I could. But there's no fuel. ANA: Well, we they have more here. They had. Whoever hit the camp last nighttook care of that very nicely. Well, listen. We-- we got to do something. We-- Just hold on. We're staying put until tomorrow's transmission. And if I get this thingfixed in time, first thing, we're going to ask for help. What if they come back? Yeah. She's right. We can't just sit here, Mark. We would be asking for it. Are there any villages near here? There is another camp on the river. It's 20 miles. There you go. All right. I don't like it. But it doesn't look like we have much choice. Try and get some extra food together. I'm going to go look for a gun. [dramatic music] [panting] [groans] Kill-- kill me. I'm [inaudible]. Ah! Help! Oh! No! [groans] Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill-- [gunfire] The Indians don't use firearms. Tommy had a pistol. It could have been him. Yeah. It might have been a handgun. You two stay here. I'll have a look. [suspenseful music] [ambient sounds of nature] Ana, how'd you ever windup in a place like this? Like everyone else, looking for freedom. Yeah. Thank you. Following my boyfriend, really. He was a rebel. The usual bullshit. - Let's go. - Why? What happened? About 300 yards from here,there's a corpse [inaudible].. We're going to get a plot in Forest Lawn. Yeah? So why don't we go shoot it? Because you wouldn't last twominutes up there, that's why. This place is crawling with Indios. Mark, aren't you goingto have something to eat? No, maybe later. Yours any good? ANA: I don't know. MARK: Sh! FRAN: OK! [suspenseful music] [gasps] No! Fran, stop! FRAN: [screams] [suspenseful music] No! No, no! [screams] Stop it! I can't take this! I can't take it! [sobs] Hey! It's all right. [sobs] They're toying with us. I don't know why. So let them. Tomorrow we're going to ask for help. [sobs] If today's stuff is asamazing as yesterday's, we'll run a brief ad campaign andbroadcast live on Saturday. Two minutes to showtime. [water roaring] Did you get it fixed yet? I think so. Good. Where's Ana? Getting us some more fruit. Is it about time? We've got a few minutes. OK. Well, we made it to this river. And, um, I have some very good news. We found Tommy. Well, actually, we haven't found him. But we-- we believe he's [audio distorts].. My god! FRAN: Did you get that, Bob? Please let me hear this. Please. Let me hear this. FRAN: But we're pretty sure that he's safe. He wasn't among the victims. BOB ALLO: Can't you do anything about it? FRAN: We believe that Tommy is headed [audio distorts],, which is atown about 10 miles from here. Come back, goddammit! Come back! Bob, she said the most important thing. She said Tommy's alive. [sighs] Yeah. So far, they haven't done us any real harm. But still it doesn't look good. Uh, if you could get word to this other camp, maybe they could send us some help. The Rio Negro. Huh? Tell them it's on the Rio Negro. [sultry music] What'll it be? I have an appointment with Fargas. I called him here a half hour ago. Not a job. All my stuff's top quality. Where's Fargas? Try the alley. [door opens] [horn honks] [door opens] [door closes] You'll pardon the show, Mr. Allo. But, in my business, the bestprofile is a low profile. Look, I don't care aboutyour wheelings and dealings. I just want my son back. That's all. Look, Francis betrayed the secret. She shouldn't have given you my number. She didn't. I took it. I want to know where those camps are. [laughs] Nobody knows that. This is $5,000. [whistles] 10,000 more when I get the information. You know, I'm sticking my ass way out, brother. I'll be in touch. Make it soon. [door opens] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [screams] [sound of struggle] Mark, where are you? [screams] Oh! Where'd he go? Oh, my god! Are you all right? [panting] Are you all right? Is he dead? God, I hope so. Mark. [panting] [phone ringing] Hello? Yes. Speaking. I got the information. You got the 10 thou. Sure. Shoot. It's in my goddamn pocket. I told you I'd give it toyou when I get to your bar. V-L-A-D-O. Vlado's camp. Rio Negro. [suspenseful music] [screams] [screams] [ambient sounds of nature] Mark? Yeah. I think I smell pizza. Listen, you stay here with equipment. I'll go find it. OK. [suspenseful music] Don't! Please. Just don't move. OK. Just relax. I'm not going to go anywhere. FRAN: Tommy! Hey, don't shoot! I'm Fran Hudson. Don't you remember me? I work for your father. [breathing shakily] [clatter] Look, you just can't siton your ass and do nothing! Look, all right. All right, Mr. Allo. Look, we got an operationin progress here. But I'll jeopardize it. I'm shorthanded. But somehow I'll find you the men. But I want you to understandone thing perfectly clear. If and when we do find your boy, he's just not going to walk out of here. Uh uh. Ana was the only decent person I had down here. [breathing shakily] Why did it have to be her? I don't know what to say, Tommy. Life's a bitch, man. [sobs] I'm sorry. Did she, uh-- did she suffer? No. [clears throat] No. [sighs] How's my dad? Your dad is fine. You know, I never reallyknew how much I loved him. [engine starts] Bring down the stuff. [water splashing] Tommy, come here and give me a hand. This thing's stuck. We'll try and take it downstream. The best chance we've got ofbeing spotted if somebody sends help. [water splashing] [suspenseful music] [water splashing] [roars] Hey, Mark. Hey, we got company. They're a ways off. Come on. Tommy, try and loosen those planks. [cracking] Mark, there's another one. Let me try and use the motor. [screams] Ah! Ah! Oh! Hey, you ready? MARK: Yeah. Get in the back. Move back! [inaudible] Here we go! [thud] [upbeat music] Can you guys really reachMiami with that thing? When the equipment's working we can. Cross your fingers. Fran, you've got 30 seconds. Yeah? OK. Got to admit, I look like shit. Life's a bitch, Fran. Oh, you smart ass. All right. 1, 2, go. OK. Well, here we are. And we hope that you're picking this up. We do have Tommy with us now. And Tommy is fine. Why don't you say something, Tommy? WOMAN: Do you really think-- WOMAN: Well, look at the hair.God-- You're right. You're absolutely right. [laughs] It is. My god, it's Tommy. Lucy, they found Tommy. FRAN: Marks' concerned that we're getting quite a ways away from the antenna. But there's not really anythingthat we can do about that. So, uh, we're heading downstream. We're looking for a village. And when we get there, we'regoing to reorganize and then start out looking for Horne. [screams] [suspenseful music] You see the blue spot here? It's where we are. Considering they headed this way, we can start sweeping thiswhole area and then we'll see. [non-english speech] OK. There is a calling helicopter for you. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Yes. When? On what? OK. Thank you. I got it. What did he say? It seems that three hoursago, during the last hookup, they were seen on the river in a canoe. My boy was with him. [non-english speech] I don't know. It seems that some kind of net caught the canoe and they lost contact. Don't worry. OK. Vamanos. Don't worry. It's only 15 minutes to the river. Come on. [airplane engine droning] [indistinct conversation] [helicopter blades beating] Listen, we have one hour of fuel left. We can just make two more sweeps. Then we have to go all theway back to base [inaudible].. [helicopter blades beating] [suspenseful music] [screams] I'm told you wanted to, um, come meet me. Why? We wanted to interview you for television live. [laughs] It's illogical. Uh, how can a dead man possiblyagree to such a request? You know, you belong to thatfoul breed of hyenas that treated these sublime [inaudible] as a crime of collective madness. You have condemned and you've mocked us. But worse, in coming here, youhave brought the world that we have rejected on our trail. You've exposed us to contamination. Your journey ends here. Forever. [breathing shakily] [non-english speech] [yelling] [helicopter blades beating] Steve. What's up? Round up all the canoes. We're going to move everythingout of here tonight-- the leaves, the cocoa,the powder, the whole lot. We'll move it down to the [inaudible] hideout. But there's tons. Well, we're just going to have to manage. I've got a feeling that those three have lowered the knife down my throat. Come the morning, we'llkill them and burn the camp. [helicopter blades beating] Can you hear? They're buzzing aroundup there like mosquitoes. [helicopter blades beating] [inaudible] There he is! That son of a bitch. Who? El Fantasma, the biggestcocaine runner in the business. Look at the size of that camp! [indistinct conversation] Look on the pier. That's el Fantasma. We have been looking for him for months. There he is! [gunfire] [non-english speech] [gunfire] [suspenseful music] Shit, we're probably goingto make a [inaudible] now. We'll have to come back tomorrow morning. Too bad. Anyway, el Fantasma and yourson I think is the same target. [dramatic music] The Colonel wants to see you. He's curious about your interview. If our interior gaze becomes [inaudible] in the contemplation of this garden, we'll feel ourselvesstripped of the relativity of our individual self. While the intuition of the absolute fills us with such serene wonder, purifying our cloudy minds. You see, Orientalphilosophy is the only form of evolved thought able tograsp the essence of life. Do you agree? What did you hope to gain by fighting me, hm? Uh, an answer. There are no answers. Only actions. For by our actions, wehave judged pure or unholy. I-- I have no intentions of judging you in-- in any kind of way. And in the morning, you'regoing to have the chance to broadcast an action of mine. [helicopter blades beating] Open that up, would you? Here, [inaudible]. Here. Oh. When I begin, don't interrupt. And keep that camera on me at all times. Do you understand? OK. Five seconds. 1, 2, go. That's him, huh? Yeah. [inaudible] people. WOMAN: What's he saying? Well, I'll have tosummarize, Miss [inaudible].. Yeah. He's saying that society's attitude towards the Reverend Jonesis the reason he's, uh, punishing us. And he will own-- Sick. Your own instruments-- yourown instruments of corruption. I've got it now. People have cornered the world cocaine market. And he will destroy the weak and chastise you with the power he now holds. I know because I personallyfelt the sting of corruption. I bought my purity at a great sacrifice. And now I have but one goal-- to free humanity of its self-indulgence, purify it once and for all. For all. And so I offer my brothersmy body, my blood, my life. What's he mean by that? I make this supreme gesture-- What's he mean by that? --so they may be fortifiedto go forth and strike corruption a mortal blow. Tell your cameraman to hold steady. I'm offering him a momentnot even the Reverend Master Jones gave humanity. [suspenseful music] [thud] [screams] [screams] [crowd screaming] [suspenseful music] [flames crackling] [crowd screaming] [screams] [thud] MARK: Get the gun! [thud] Mark, behind you! Mark, watch out!
