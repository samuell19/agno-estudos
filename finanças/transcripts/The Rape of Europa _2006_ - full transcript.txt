Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Christie's and to this evening's sale of impressionist and modern art. Lot 11 is the 1922 Picasso there, "Buste de femme la chemise". A Picasso painting torn from a German museum wall in 1937 is just now resurfacing at auction in New York City. Four million nine hundred thousand, $5 million. At $5 million, $6 million. Six million two hundred thousand, six million two. No? All done, and selling here then. Last chance at six million two. For you, sir, six million two, thank you. The last time this Picasso was at auction, it sold for just $1,800 as part of a campaign to rid Germany of artwork the Nazis condemned. Adolf Hitler purged art he hated, and he stole art he coveted. The Nazis were not just the most systematic mass murderers in history, they were the greatest thieves. They stole everything. Art of all kinds would be vulnerable to Hitler's plan: Paintings, sculpture, furniture, religious objects. There's always been looting. There was planned looting done by Napoleon, but this was really industrial. Along with looting, the Nazis unleashed a modern war that destroyed historic European architecture. In the struggle to defeat Hitler, the allies would have to choose between saving lives and causing even more damage. There is the age-old argument: Which is of more value, a work of art or a human life? Today, even after more than 60 years, lost art is still being found, battle damage is still being repaired, and stolen masterpieces are still caught up in bitter disputes. All of this is the unfinished business of the greatest war in history. This painting, in Vienna, it's their Mona Lisa. This is their icon. This is one of the most important images of Austrian art of the 20th century. The painting was stolen by the Nazis during the war. Over 60 years ago, Gustav Klimt's portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer became part of the collection of the Austrian national gallery in Vienna. Now worth more than $100 million, it is just one of many works of art whose ownership has been contested since the Nazis wrought havoc on the art world of Europe. Most people call this viennese icon "the gold portrait." Few think of it as a portrait of a viennese Jew and a reminder of the Jewish community that flourished here before world war ii. When the Nazis occupied Austria, they stole the Klimt portrait from this building, then the home of ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a prominent Jewish art collector. The Nazis commandeered the Bloch-Bauer home. And the various representatives of the museums came together and picked out paintings and porcelain and sculpture that they wanted for their collections. This is the document that sent the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer over to the Austrian gallery. And at the bottom of the document, it says, "I sign with heil Hitler." For years, Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece has fought a legal battle with the Austrian government for ownership of her aunt's portrait and four other Klimt paintings her family once owned. I grew up with the paintings. So that when people ask me, "do you remember the paintings?" Well, yeah, every Sunday for lunch we were there, and the Klimt paintings were all in Adele's room. My uncle commissioned Klimt to paint the portrait of my aunt Adele. Adele and ferdinand Bloch-Bauer were major patrons in Vienna's vibrant modern art scene before the war. Artists from all over flocked to Vienna to take part in the modernist revolution. While Klimt worked on Adele's portrait, three young artists were applying to Austria's top art academies. Egon schiele and Oskar Kokoschka both went on to become great modern painters. The third was an unknown 18-year-old named Adolf Hitler. Schiele and Kokoschka were accepted and Hitler was not. And Kokoschka always said jokingly, "imagine if Hitler would have been accepted "and I would have been rejected. "I would have run the world quite differently, "and he couldn't have done that harm that he did, being a bad painter." In its basement archives, the center for military history in Washington, D.C., stores many Nazi paintings too controversial for public exhibition. Among them are early watercolors by Adolf Hitler. He was a mediocre painter. Not terrible, but clearly not gifted. He thought himself gifted, though. He certainly thought himself able enough to have been admitted to the academy of fine arts in Vienna, and he took it as a real rejection. Many of the jurors at the academy were Jewish, and I suspect that this fueled his anti-semitism. Generally, he hated what was going on in modern art as a would-be artist himself. There were Jewish artists around, heaven's sakes. Not only that, some of those figures looked like they were wild black negroes from Africa. "How come people like nolde and kandinsky can be shown "and all this to-do about them, and they don't let me shine as an artist?" It must have riled him. Over the next 20 years, as Hitler created the Nazi party and rose to power, art continued to obsess him and became part of his political agenda. By the early 1930s, he was in a position to force his artistic tastes on Germany. He believed that artists who produced modern art could not see colors as they appeared in nature, they could not see forms as they actually were, and that this was a sign of racial inferiority. "You Germans shouldn't see that, it will foul your mind. "It will stain your whole life if you do that, so we get rid of it." In a 1937 speech, Hitler shouted, "we will from now on lead "an unrelenting war of purification, "an unrelenting war of extermination against the last forces which have displaced our art!" Hitler began with a purge of German museums, ordering them to cleanse their collections of 16,000 works by modern masters like Matisse, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Hitler labeled all such works "degenerate." Modern art was then ridiculed and condemned in a hugely successful "degenerate art" exhibit that toured Germany. And the best of the German museums' collections of modern art were auctioned off at fire sale prices to benefit the reich. Thousands of purged artworks were simply burned. Germany was destroying its own standing as a world leader in modern art. Next, Hitler commissioned his first public building for Nazi Germany, the house of German art, in Munich. There, he would display contemporary paintings and sculpture that glorified the third reich. It would be a museum for the new fascist art, overseen by Hitler himself. It was actually very unusual for a head of state to get this involved in cultural matters, but it was all part of his really racist ideology that everything had to be pure down to the last detail in Germany. Hitler would go with the curators of this thing and choose what was going to be in it. Year after year it went on, right until the end of the war. And it was all for sale, but most of it had to be bought by the government because nobody really wanted it. With proceeds from his best-selling bookmein kampf, Hitler had set himself up as a collector of fine art. Every year, he purchased 250 paintings from the museum, which he added to his growing collection of old masters and sentimental germanic art. Other Nazi leaders followed his example. Art collecting became a required pastime for the Nazi party elite. It was not just Hitler. Every Nazi leader had an art collection. If one goes down the line through g ring and goebbels, himmler, Albert Speer, the party leaders all had art collections and spent a great deal of time amassing these artworks and trying to influence cultural policy. After Hitler, the most enthusiastic Nazi art collector was Hermann g ring, head of the Luftwaffe, the German air force. But g ring was a different sort of collector than the rest of the Nazi leadership. He cared more about the size and prestige of his collection than its ideological correctness. G ring was a flamboyant personality. He thought of himself as romantic and heroic. He was an illustrious fighter pilot from world war I with tremendous social connections, and he lived this ostentatious lifestyle. He was not a particularly well-educated man. He was someone who cared about making himself look like he was civilized and sophisticated and a man of culture, and that's what men of culture did, they collected art. Because he was the second most powerful person in Nazi Germany, this gave him ample opportunity to embezzle and to enrich himself. He also encouraged the giving of gifts. Art was the preferred gift, oftentimes very, very expensive artworks. It became clear to some Jewish collectors that they could play on g ring's desire or the desire of the Nazi leaders to collect and use works of art to save themselves and their families. You know, a painting could be traded for a life. With the annexation of Austria in 1938, organized looting of Jewish property began on a massive scale. Even the German party leaders were surprised by the anti-semitic fervor of Austrian Nazis. The Austrians, they talk now about being the victims. They were never victims. Of course, there were some that were against it, but there overall was a royal welcome. Maria altmann was a new bride just back from her honeymoon when Hitler entered Vienna. Everything changed after march 11. It became a different life, a different city. When the Nazis came, they threw us out of the apartment, and the gestapo man took the apartment for himself. We left Vienna. At that time, I didn't even think about what we are leaving behind, because we only thought of saving our lives. The portrait of Maria's aunt Adele by Gustav Klimt was just one of hundreds of artworks left behind when the Bloch-Bauer family fled Nazi Austria. After agents for Hitler, g ring, and other Nazi officials chose what they wanted, the rest of the collection, including the Klimt paintings, was divided up among the state museums of Vienna. Some were returned to the family after the war, but the Klimt paintings remained in the Austrian national gallery. I think there is a general understanding that these paintings belong simply to Austria. And we have reason for this. It's written down in a document. It's written down in the last will of Adele Bloch-Bauer. Maria's aunt died in 1925 and left behind a hand-written will. In this will she asks that her husband give the paintings to the Austrian gallery upon his death. And what happened was, of course, that the paintings were taken from him, stolen by the Nazis before he died. Adele's husband escaped to Switzerland in 1939 and died in exile after the war. He never got the klimts back. After the war, the Austrians decided not to return the paintings based on the claim that under Adele Bloch-Bauer's will of 1923, they had the right and title. It's very, very clear that she always had in mind that these paintings would come at the end of the day to the Austrian gallery. The paintings belong in the museums. They have to be seen by the public. But not in Austria when they keep them there under a lie. What upsets me so is the total injustice that they don't admit that they are not theirs. Adele Bloch-Bauer's will has been the focus of much of this dispute. The Austrian authorities interpret the will as a bequest to the Austrian national gallery. On the other hand, when she drafted her will in 1923, she had no idea what would transpire and the kind of persecution that would take place in Vienna, in her country. And so it's a very complicated situation. The struggle over Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is only one of many such disputes left in the wake of the Nazis' vast art-looting operation. The Nazis were systematic about their plundering. There was a plundering bureaucracy, if you will. They employed bureaucrats, they employed art experts. There were thousands of individuals who participated in the plundering of artworks during world war ii. The bureaucracy was an administrative infrastructure set up to feed works of art straight into Hitler's collection. Hitler had been collecting art for quite some time, but he started to think about an art collection in a more systematic way, and the epiphany comes when he travels to Italy on a state visit to see Mussolini. Hitler was not a very sophisticated or well-educated person. He had never been to Italy. He had never seen most of the great monuments of Europe, so that when he did go and he was taken to some of the great museums in Rome and Florence, he was absolutely smitten by this. He spent hours and insisted on seeing absolutely everything. He has this idea, it's really for him an inspiration, that he is going to create a great museum as a monument to his rule. Linz, Austria, Hitler's provincial hometown, would be the site for the enormous f hrermuseum. Hitler planned to turn Linz into the cultural capital of Europe. Starting from sketches he drew in his youth, he ordered his architects to prepare secret plans to remake this small industrial town into a grand imperial city. In the town of Linz, he had visualized an Avenue up to... From left to right of different buildings, and I call it Hitler's acropolis. The Linz project is really connected to Hitler's legacy. There's going to be an opera house, a symphony hall, a great library. There's also going to be a mausoleum with his tomb. And at the center of the Linz complex is going to be the greatest museum, not only in Europe, but in the entire world, dozens of galleries that would hold thousands of artworks. The collection was for the state. Hitler thought the reich should have a great art collection for prestige. This is going to be on a very big scale. He is prepared to purchase the artworks, of course, but he has really no compunction about stealing them. This museum is going to be created both by purchase and by plunder. Hitler and his ministers were commissioning art historians to draw up lists of artworks abroad that the Germans wanted. The hit list, if you will, predated the invasions of these countries. The plans to create the f hrermuseum, the plans to steal, were inextricably linked with these plans to conquer. Hundreds of Polish artworks were on Hitler's wish list. But for the Nazis, most of Poland's slavic cultural patrimony wasn't even worth stealing. Because the Nazis considered the slavs, like the Jews, to be subhuman, Polish culture was declared "degenerate" and marked for destruction. In the capital, Warsaw, even historic architecture was targeted, particularly the Warsaw royal castle, home of the Polish kings for six centuries, seat of the parliament, and a national cultural treasure. In 1939, Hitler ordered his forces to, quote, "kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent and language" in the "invasion and extermination of Poland." On September 1st, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. As German troops advanced, they deliberately targeted civilians, toppled statues, and leveled historic buildings. The Nazis sent special "fire units" to burn Poland's libraries floor by floor. The Nazis planned to take Poland and clear out the indigenous populations and then repopulate the whole area with germanic peoples. Poland, basically, as a civilization and a country, ceased to exist. They were not only to be eliminated as a people, but their whole culture was to be eliminated. During the attack on Warsaw, Hitler personally ordered the shelling of the royal castle. He had been told of a Polish anthem that said, "as long as the Warsaw castle stands, Poland is not yet lost." Damaged by shelling and stripped bare of art and furniture by Nazi looters, the castle still stood as the Germans took over Warsaw. But knowing the Poles' deep patriotic attachment to the castle, the Nazis bored holes in its foundation and filled them with explosives to create a permanent threat of complete destruction. After years of oppression, the people of Warsaw rose up to take back their city from the Nazis. The Germans crushed the uprising, killing over 200,000 Poles. And the Nazis made good their threat: The dynamite charges that had been placed four years earlier were detonated, destroying the Warsaw castle completely. In cracow, the heart of the old city was preserved, because unlike slavic Warsaw, the Nazis considered cracow to be germanic. But cracow was home to the art masterpieces most coveted by the Nazis. And here, systematic looting would begin in earnest. Veit stoss was a bavarian who came to cracow early in the 15th century. For this altar, he used as models his neighbors from here. So it was a shock for cracovians when it was opened. They saw the normal, regular faces of their neighbors being now saints, apostles. The Nazis believed that all germanic works of art should come back to the fatherland, and among these was the veit stoss altarpiece. Now, it didn't matter that it had been commissioned for the church by the king of Poland. The thing that was important was that it had been done by a German artist and therefore should not be in the hands of an alien race, which was the slavs. The Poles had dismantled the 43-foot-high altarpiece and its life-size wooden figures and hid them in the countryside. But within weeks of the invasion, the Nazis tracked them down, and the altarpiece was shipped to Berlin. It was a true loss for cracovians. They were so accustomed that it belonged to this place that they couldn't find their way to the prayer without it. Meanwhile, Nazi art plunderers were busy looting hundreds of Poland's other masterpieces. They were compiled in an elaborate catalogue meant only for the eyes of Adolf Hitler. At the top of the list were Leonardo da Vinci's lady with an ermine, Rembrandt'slandscape with a good samaritan, andportrait of a young man by Raphael. The three priceless paintings were all in a small, private museum in cracow, owned by a noble family, the czartoryskis. The czartoryskis decided to hide the paintings at their country estate 100 miles outside of cracow. The objects were brought down here to this cellar and one of the... are placed in one of the alcoves, which was then walled up and covered over with plaster. Unfortunately, the comings and goings did not escape attention, and when the Germans arrived, they broke down the wall. And, of course, being soldiers, what they took was all the gold objects. They left the pictures lying around on the floor. The Leonardo actually had a boot Mark on it. The three paintings were intended for Hitler's Linz museum, but the new Nazi governor of Poland kept them in his private apartments in cracow. After the war ended, the Leonardo and the Rembrandt were returned by the allies to the czartoryski museum in cracow. The Raphael has never been found. If this Raphael were to come up for sale at auction today, it would be $100 million, definitely. It has a strange quality of fascination, and so that's why I suspect it's still out there somewhere. It could have been painted over, which people did in order to smuggle things, and have fallen into the hands of somebody else who may not know what they've got. Or it may have gone into the underworld, the criminal underworld, which does use this kind of object as currency. Inside the Polish ministry of culture, Monika kuhnke and her colleagues have compiled a database of artworks stolen during the war that are still missing. The program contains 59,000 items, estimated to be just a tenth of Poland's total loss. Perhaps the most celebrated collection of art ever assembled under one roof, the louvre museum in Paris spans eight miles of galleries and contains about 400,000 priceless works of art, the cultural patrimony of the people of France. After Germany conquered Poland, the French feared that Paris would become the next target of Luftwaffe bombing raids, and sitting at the heart of the city was the louvre. Museum staff gathered around the winged victory of samothrace as the museum director gave the order to evacuate the great treasures of the louvre to castles outside Paris. Within hours of the evacuation plan being announced, the louvre became an enormous packing yard. Since many of the museum staff had been called to the front, volunteers were recruited from all over Paris to help pack, from secretaries to department store clerks to truck drivers. The greatest challenge was moving the 2,000-year-old winged victory, which now had to descend the long staircase on her way to safety. An eyewitness later recalled, "the statue rocked onto an inclined wooden ramp. "We were all terrified, and the silence was total "as thevictory rolled slowly forward, her stone wings trembling slightly." The curator of sculpture "sank down on the stone steps, murmuring, 'i will not see her return.'" Thirty-seven convoys of eight trucks each departed from the louvre, leaving the vast museum virtually empty. In may 1940, the German army swept through Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and into France. It was a shock to the French, who had prepared for air raids but not a full-scale invasion of their country. All the works of art had to move in really chaotic conditions, along with millions of refugees who were on the road. There would be a truck full of louvre paintings, and next to it would be another truck from the French treasury full of gold bars, and the government ministers speeding by in limousines. It was just total chaos, and the miracle is that the French collections really did survive almost intact. Themona Lisa had her own vehicle. She was put in an ambulance that was specially sealed to maintain a constant level of humidity. There was a curator who rode in the ambulance with her, and it was so well sealed up that the curator, when they opened the ambulance, was unconscious, but the Mona Lisa was absolutely fine. Themona Lisa and other louvre masterpieces arrived at castles and abbeys in the south of France. They would be periodically moved throughout the war to stay a step ahead of the Germans. The curators lived in the castles alongside the artworks. One married couple brought along their teenage daughter. Six weeks after the start of the invasion, France fell. Germany now controlled most of the European continent. The day after France surrendered, Hitler secretly flew to Paris before dawn, accompanied by his architect Albert Speer. It was his first and only visit to the city. Hitler remarked to Speer, "it was the dream of my life to see Paris. "I cannot say how happy I am to have that dream fulfilled today." Hitler told Speer that he had often considered destroying Paris. And with that, he ordered his architect to resume work on his grandiose plans for the rebuilding of Berlin. When they were completed, he said, "Paris will only be a shadow, so why should we destroy it?" Unlike his harsh treatment of the slavic cities of Poland, Hitler preserved Paris as a sophisticated playground for German military officers. While the Nazi high command enjoyed the pleasures of the city, they hadn't forgotten about the French national collections, still sheltered in castles in the French countryside. Hitler wanted many of the artworks for his museum in Linz, and g ring wanted others for himself. The Nazi authorities knew that these works they wanted on their hit list were in chateaus, but they refrained from seizing works in state collections. The Germans didn't want to antagonize the French or to incite open rebellion. They did not have the resources to control every corner of France at that time, so the takeover of France was much more gradual. First, they would steal from the Jews, and then later, they would acquire the works that they wanted from French state collections. There were a number of notable Jewish collections in France. Paris was the capital of the art market, and one had these great art-dealing dynasties, and they had huge collections. A month into the Nazi occupation, gestapo teams raided the galleries of the 15 leading Jewish art dealers. The seligmann family was right up there among the top dealers in Paris. This is a photo of my father, before the war, when he started his business. Goodness. I was quite young when the war started. My father specialized in old masters. And g ring visited the gallery in 1938, before the war, and my father actually threw him out of the gallery because he knew who g ring was and what he was trying to do. So as a result, he... that was the first gallery they looted during the war. The amount of art stolen from Jewish collectors soon grew so large that the jeu de paume museum, in the center of Paris, was requisitioned for storage. The operation would be overseen by the anti-semitic task force known as the e.R.R. The Nazis made sure to keep up the appearance of legality. According to the new occupation laws, Jews who fled or were deported to death camps were stripped of their citizenship. The Nazis could then declare their property "ownerless" and available for plunder. Inside the archives of the national museums of France is a volume of handwritten notes which traces the journey of the 16,000 paintings stolen from Jewish parisians during the war. Compiled in great secrecy, it notes each work that entered the jeu de paume and the name of the family from which it was stolen. It is the work of rose Valland, a dedicated curator who is today considered a heroine of France and certainly its most unlikely spy. Nobody knew that every night when she went home, with her remarkable memory, she kept a secret diary of what French paintings, owned publically or privately, were taken by whom, sent where. Rose Valland managed to stay at the jeu de paume despite the constant danger of deportation or execution. In November of 1940, she became concerned about unusual activity that swept over the museum. Rose Valland noticed it was great excitement, that the pictures weren't just being inventoried, but all of a sudden they were being hung up on the walls and there was clearly going to be a party or an opening of some kind, and indeed there was, because g ring himself came to the jeu de paume to see what was available for his collections and for Hitler's. He, of course, was clever enough to know that major works, such as vermeer's astronomer, which had been confiscated from the rothschilds, should go to the f hrer for the Linz museum, but still this opened up many possibilities of items that he could then take himself. Over the next few years, g ring would visit the jeu de paume 20 times, taking over 700 works of art for himself. Hermann g ring spent a great deal of time in Paris. Sometimes there's a disconnect. The battle of Britain is raging, and Hermann g ring, overseeing the Luftwaffe in their critical moment, is taking breaks in Paris, where he's visiting art dealers and restaurants and nightclubs, drinking champagne and eating oysters. The loot from g ring's pleasure trips to Paris, the Netherlands, and Belgium was shipped by boxcar load to the door of his palatial hunting lodge, carinhall. Carinhall was g ring's country estate which was built outside Berlin. It was also the primary repository for his art collection. It started off as a rather woodsy chalet, and it was very homey. It had a big fireplace and it had a lot of stone built into it, but gradually it grew in size, and he redecorated, and it became utterly opulent and ostentatious. It was added onto and there were massive galleries: Vast corridors with marble and tapestries and rugs and paintings and sculptures. We're talking about a collection of paintings alone that was probably about 1,700 paintings. As a comparison, that's more than the national gallery of art's European paintings collection. Historian Nancy yeide is trying to compile the first complete inventory of Hermann g ring's art collection. One of yeide's goals is to locate paintings looted by g ring that went missing after the war, including a small painting by Fran Ois Boucher, stolen from andr seligmann in Paris. We were looking for this boucher, and we were surprised to find an image on the Utah museum of fine arts web site that matched the lost seligmann boucher. The Utah museum had no idea that this was a confiscated and unrestituted picture. Well, I first became aware that the boucher painting was found when a woman came to see me. And she said, "we've found a painting of yours, and it's in a museum, and they're willing to cooperate." A painting stolen by Nazis and recovered in Utah is going home. The story, coming up on 2 news. The museum's executive director calls it an important day. The art loss register provided evidence that we did not have rightful ownership, and on that basis, we initiated the decision to return the painting to the rightful heirs of andr seligmann. Good morning. I'm the daughter of andr seligmann. This is a very emotional day for me. We are very excited to get this painting from the museum, and they have been really... I can only use the word "adorable"... about this. Are you ready? One, two, three. You know, my father would have wanted me to have this painting, and it's just a shame that he didn't live to see any of this going on. I was a little sad when I began to think about returning the painting. It's been an important part of our permanent exhibits, but I also saw the larger moral responsibility. We can't make amends for the millions of lives that were taken, but we can do something simple: Return something stolen and confer a little humanity back on all of us. In occupied Paris, trains packed with stolen art continued to leave for Germany. More than 22,000 items would be shipped to the reich. But the theft of fine art was just the beginning. Now, the e.R.R. Began a new, more radical project. The union of parisian movers was forced to supply 150 trucks and 1,200 workers a day to help carry out the operation. Jacques Altman, a young parisian Jew, was about to be deported to a death camp in Poland when he was held back and transferred to a new slave labor camp set up at a train station in the center of Paris. At the camp, Jewish prisoners were forced to sort, clean, repair, and pack stolen Jewish belongings that were then sent to families in Germany. Train after train rolled eastward, many carrying Jews to concentration camps. Others followed, loaded with their property and works of art. For years, the very best pieces of art and furniture looted from the Jews of France were delivered to the Neuschwanstein castle in the remote Alps of southern Germany. By the summer of 1941, Hitler had Western Europe under firm control. Now he looked to the east to expand the Nazi empire even further. In a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, Hitler diverted millions of troops to a new 2,000-mile front. The Soviet Union was a target in the same way that Poland was. It was a primarily slavic nation. In fact, it was subjected to even harsher treatment because it was communist-run. Hitler ordered his generals to wage a war of annihilation. It was a scorched earth campaign that struck at the very heart of Russian art and culture. The for Russia is not only an art museum. It's the symbol of Russian state history. The Russian empire began here and ended here. So because of this, the is a great symbol for every Russian. There is a great museum which belongs to them, which is something which Russia is very proud of and which is one of the essence of what Russia culture is. When news of the invasion reached the museum, officials cleared the crowded galleries of visitors and began the frantic evacuation of its immense collection. We are kind of not accustomed. You can't be accustomed to wars, but we know how to behave in wars. The was evacuated during the first world war. By the way, it was also evacuated during the war with the French in the 19th century. So when Germans invaded in the second world war, the was prepared to evacuate. Compared to the louvre in Paris, the had over four times the number of objects to evacuate. The vast collections of the Russian czars included everything from paintings and furniture to porcelains and antiquities. The also got a late start, but the white nights of Leningrad's summer helped to make up time, as packing could go on around the clock. Within a month of the invasion, Soviet trains had carried over a million of the most prized treasures 1,100 miles away to Siberia. But half the museum's holdings would remain in peril when the Nazi forces encircled Leningrad just weeks later. The enemy was now only eight miles from the museum. It was the start of the 900-day siege of Leningrad. In the first two months of the siege, the Nazis fired over 12,000 shells and dropped over 60,000 bombs on Leningrad. In October, Hitler ordered his generals "to wipe the city off the face of the earth." staff and the city's artistic community took shelter in the network of cellars underneath the museum. During the first winter of the siege, 2,000 people inhabited this freezing, subterranean world. Throughout Leningrad, reserves of fuel were running out just as the days began to grow shorter and colder. Starvation set in. During November and December of 1941, 70,000 people died. In the cellars of the , staff workers were dying, but the survivors kept up the exhaustive effort to protect the museum and its remaining works of art. Through the bitter winter, blizzards sent snow through thousands of bomb-shattered windows, and for three months, the starving museum workers used crowbars to chip away 80 tons of ice and broken glass that had frozen to the walls, ceilings, and parquet floors of the ornate galleries. Work was one of the ways to prevent from dying. You have bombs, you have no windows, you have snow, you have rain, you have people dying. So it was museum work in extreme situation. When the snow melted with the first spring, a burial squad came to the . From an improvised mortuary in the cellar, they removed 46 corpses that had stayed frozen through the winter. The dead were taken to a plot of wasteland on the outskirts of the city that would become, over the next two years, the common grave for a half million Russian victims of the siege. From France to Russia, the whole of Europe was under attack, and alarming reports about Nazi theft and destruction were reaching art professionals at a brand-new museum far from the . To accept this work today is to assert the purpose of the people of america, that the freedom of the human spirit which has produced the world's great art shall not be utterly destroyed. The United States was about to declare war on Nazi Germany. And from the national gallery of art in Washington, a group of museum officials and academics known as the Roberts commission warned president Roosevelt of a grave problem facing the allied armies: How to save Europe without further destroying its historic buildings and cultural treasures in the process. The primary concern was buildings and monuments, because this was the first war in which bombing was a major problem. Everybody had seen what happened in england during the blitz, so they knew that when armies invaded that this would be a major issue. The first invasion came in the summer of 1943, when america and its western allies launched a massive attack against German occupation forces in southern Italy. We had a tough time. The Germans put up a great deal of resistance, so in the process, we pretty much destroyed Italy. Many of the villages and towns were actually just leveled. For civil affairs officers reporting back to the Roberts commission in Washington, the collateral damage to monuments was shocking. Although from the military point of view the damage wasn't overwhelming, for a person who was interested in classical architecture and art, it was devastating. In Italy, and later elsewhere in Western Europe, some battle-hardened G.I.s only added to the problem of destruction. Local officials complained of allied soldiers making off with books, coin collections, and even stuffed monkeys from a natural history museum. General Eisenhower worried that this misconduct was bringing on bad publicity. And worse, he saw that his army threatened to harm the artistic heritage of Italy.

Eighty miles south of Rome, the allied advance was blocked by a heavily defended mountain.
