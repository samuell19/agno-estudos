A sex partner Don't take her for a whore She looks like one Otake holds her, looking solemn "Hold me tighter!" Do women undress themselves? There're many kinds of women What if she said "will you help me undress?" Nobody would say that to you She'd undress by herself Why? She looked the type She's not my type So what? Otake doesn't care What? Otake is smart You like him? Yes About 469... Yes Let me see her Why not phone her? Know her address? I'll try the school Hello?

"When you sleep with two sisters you must lay the elder one first" "Three, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an ugly girl you must cover her face with a rag" "Four, hey, hey!" "When you get laid upstairs you must be careful not to make noise" Let's go There are lots of folk songs They exist throughout Japan from northern Hokkaido, to Okinawa They're sung when people farm or fish at sea, or carry goods or try to make babies sleep. Anything There are many folk songs which are still sung today They contain phrases about sex Suggestive songs represent the voices of the oppressed The toil and love of the oppressed working class They sang songs to describe their misery Suggestive songs tell the people's history. Done That's no reason to sing with students around I pity these youngsters They can't sense anything directly and seriously They don't care about politics They can't even see they're oppressed That's why I must sing such songs to them As if a ruined nation singing about how the country get ruined So what? We're a ruined people! "It was three years ago My village was gripped by famine" "My folks had to sell either their daughter or house" "Eventually they sold me for 3,000 in gold" "They put makeup on my face and shoved me in a palanquin" "I went to a brothel in the Yoshiwara district" "I didn't even know where I was let alone the brothel's name" "I didn't refuse even customers I really hated" "Every night I slept with a different man" "I had to do it for the sake of my family" Let's go Leaving so soon? It's only the beginning Sing for Lawrence's sake What's Lawrence? I don't know, either "Lawrence of Arabia" was a hero who attacked Turkey I'll attack bathhouse whores I'm Lawrence of Shinjuku Will you be "Lawrence of Arabia"? Or Lawrence of Shinjuku, which? "Each of our deeds should be connected with wrath" "Glutting on joy and sleep at night will only make us waste our time" "Any way, love is the only behaviors of resistance" "They crush love" "If you parents or wife are found siding with the enemy," "you must leave them" "Don't hesitate to hate them Don't be ashamed of being a fanatic" "I owe them my misfortune" "They almost ruined me" "Hatred decreases the value of human life" "Hatred is born from poverty" "Knowing that kindles rage making hatred even stronger" Miss the last train?

"When you sleep with two sisters you must lay the elder one first" "Three, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an ugly girl you must cover her face with a bucket" Some guy!

With the stove on Wake up Stay in bed Fool! Come closer Why? Closer What is it? I saw it! Lecher! You're no good We'll see the exhibition Otake sent us here so we'd have sex together That's why he sang You guys are really lecherous! 7,000 years ago in a fertile delta the first civilization was born Of men and women If you are not going the exhibition you should go to thank him Must we? If you bring him, we'll thank him Let's go Let's go "One, hey, hey!" Nice song The best song If Otake sings it "To be," "or not to be..." Check-out time Hey, you! "To be, or not to be..." What? Tails What's wrong? Leave! That's enough Mr. Otake was drunk last night, right? Yes He sang loudly, right? Yes, he did That's why... He's dead? What happened? He turned on the stove and fell asleep Stove? He slept with it on He kicked it and the hose got loose The room was filled with gas He was intoxicated. The cops were there Are you kidding? Gas poisoned? He caused it himself Aren't you sad that Mr. Otake's dead? Of course. He was kind to us Some are happy too Ass! Stop! The man is dead He was very kind, wasn't he? So what? Kindness was his job He passed away! Yes, but stupidly Anyone could laugh at him You're crazy! Ingrates! Scum! He's a fool Blame him before blaming us How can you talk like that? I get it. You're crying because Mr. Otake, whom you liked died in such a silly way? Shall we go? Yes, we'd better It's common sense Which of you is Hiroi? I am Ueda? Me You're Maruyama? Yes Nakamura? Yes You brought Otake home, right? Yes You left here? About 10:30pm? Yes He said to come in but we left because he was drunk Who turned on the stove? Mr. Otake He died of gas poisoning by mistake Know anything else? No I came back later to get something Get something? Yes, I left my pen here I see. Can we talk? Did he really do it? I don't think so He might have No reason to kill him Yes? You suspect me, huh? But you could have killed him, right? I could have. But I'm not that stupid Murder can happen without a reason It's stupid. Why suspect me? I don't. I'm just curious To kill time? After such fun... He even sang for us I fixed shrimp for him His last word was "exhibition" I last met him at the demonstration "One, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an only child you need her parents' permission" That was his last song You were the one who followed me, right? We wondered what you were to him Did he sing such a song? He couldn't have He must've sung... nicer songs Didn't he? Three teas Thirsty, huh? Quit crying She bought a handkerchief Shall we go? We four killed Otake You four? Yeah, we four We went there after you slept Because we're angry You didn't let us in Otake talked so big That gas stove... Gas stove? We kicked it Let's take that Aren't you taking another line? Who cares? We'll talk later What you said was a lie, wasn't it? Not at all They're watching us Shall we wave a handkerchief? Did they believe us? I hope they won't talk You gab too much No. Nakamura said it was true It made Sanae cry Did you talk seriously? Yes What did you tell the cops? Don't tell me you really did it You kicked the stove? No. Why would I? We could have laid one of the gals We could've laid them all Even beasts look sexy crying But we were one too many Depends on how it's done Getting Sanae would've been easy Because she cried? Grab her from behind? You guys... "One, hey, hey!" "When you lay Sanae Satomi you must do it while drying her tears" Women should resist. Tomoko's better It'd be tough to lay her We'd have to rip off her clothes What would she say? "Mother!" "Two, hey, hey!" "When you lay Tomoko Ikegami you'd need petroleum jelly" "Three, hey, hey!" "When you lay Sachiko Kaneda..." She isn't sexy I wonder why she's like that "Four, hey, hey!" "When you lay No. 469 you must do it while asking her name" "Five, hey, hey!" "When you lay No. 469 you must use a desk for a bed" "Six, hey, hey!" "When you lay No. 469 you must do it while taking exams" Who'll get the examiner? Who's to get the examiner? Leave it to me You won't do Let me do it Who cares about the examiner? Where will she be? In front Who'll tell her? Maruyama's best I'm a glib talker I'm a poor talker Really? Take her by force She may resist, but not much Someone may help her Get him too Whose turn? Mine You do it Go! Be careful Get on with it She has a two piece outfit Why take so long? You can't do it, right? Through already? Why so fast? I can't do it so easily I'm next She's unconscious My turn next How do I do it? Can you do it? I'm not like you How will you do it? Not that way Maybe you can't see Tired, huh? Can you tell 469 what we did? Sure. Why not? What do you want? Listen... Me? Sure I can What brings you? Want to talk to me? No It's hard to tell her what we imagined You think of her house as small Think of it as big The four of us... "One, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an only child you need her parents' permission" "Two, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with two sisters you must lay the elder one first" You lied It was a lie that you killed Otake I'm glad Of course Or we wouldn't be singing like this You came to say that? Yes, all the way No more singing? May I sing, too? Know any songs? Of course We'd welcome it Right, Nakamura? "On a night when it was drizzling" "I saw someone peeking through the window" "A railway man wearing a uniform What a clod!" "50 sen for touching Free for just looking" "If you pay me 3 yen 50 sen" "I'll stay with you until the cock crows" What song is that? For women Where did you learn it? "Will you come in or will you leave? Which?" "Please decide quickly" "Make up your mind and come in" "Mister, tissues are expensive nowadays" "Consider what the clerks will think" "So pay them a 50 sen tip" "Then I'll go to bed with you, hold you" "And help you do it another two or three times" "We'll do it until the cock crows" The end I may have killed Otake I saw the gas hose was off I could have save him, but I didn't Give me 10 yen Can you tell Miss Tanigawa Otake's sweetheart, what you said? You can, right? She said to come to the boarding house. Understand? Come over What? Help us to call the college Hey, we found out 469's name It's Mayuko Fujiwara We're thinking about publishing Otake's writings. What do you think? Good idea His study on the Mounted Tribe is good Yes What about his work on politics? Omit it. It has no meaning The diaries he wrote as a student are better His observations of politicians look childish Otake wouldn't like it Diaries are better They tell us how he felt about what happened then What about his letters? Of course! Miss Tanigawa, you have many, right? Miss Tanigawa! Wait. We'd best give her more time to think Listen. Let's all sing "Protect and shield the way I go" "Young friends, stretch out your hands" "Don't trouble the shining sun and blue sky with warfare" "Even the A-bomb couldn't destroy our friendship" "Our fighting spirit is burning like a fire Let's fight for peace" "Let's unite closely and firmly Guide our way!" One more song for his meaningful death "How brave you are to join the fight for justice..." Stop! What's meaningful about his death? He died during the anti-Empire Day movement His death was a protest against it Ridiculous! His death isn't meaningful! It is. And it's our duty to prove it Nonsense! His death is meaningless! Are you disgracing the dead? No! Indeed you are! I'm just telling the truth Think how Miss Tanigawa feels Consider where you are "One, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an only child you need her parents' permission" "Two, hey, hey!" Stop! Quit it! Stop fighting! Everyone, will you leave now? Is this where she lives? Yeah. That's 469's house Mayuko Fujiwara Shall we see her? Anti-Vietnam War Folk Song Convention What'll we do? Now that we came Let's go in Must we pay admission? We came to see her Let's leave Not until we talk to her Get it over with Then we'll leave I'm worried about Nakamura You're the only one who saw this I thought it was smaller Let's go back Shall we sing, too? "One, hey, hey!" Stop singing that song! "When you sleep with an only child you need her parents' permission" "Two, hey, hey!" "Three, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an ugly girl" Let's go Okay We've sung our song Ueda! Hiroi! Maruyama! Maybe it's my fault What? I may have killed Mr. Otake When I entered his room he was asleep The place was filled with gas I could have shut it off That's hard to believe I don't care if it is Then why tell me? I went to get my pen. Excuse me Mr. Otake! Then what happened? Sir! What about the gas? Why didn't you help him? Did you want him dead? What were you thinking about? Nothing Go on "One, hey, hey!" Stop singing that song! I sang like this Liar! You couldn't have "One, hey, hey!" Stop! Liar! It's all a big lie! "When you sleep with an only child you need her parents' permission" What'll I do? Wait a year? No. I'll go to some other college That's it. Don't waste a year My folks won't pay my tuition unless I start college this year I have to work while going to cram school How could you do it? How about Nakamura? You mean the exam? What's he doing now? Probably nothing But he went to Otake's place With that woman? Otake's woman? They're talking now What about? The last train! We still have time "It's a long road, without ends" It's in Japanese "But why are you clenching your teeth?" "Do you really have to go?" "Your darling is not here anymore" "Why are you still looking for him?" "Do you really have to go? Even you don't have a goal?" I think I'll go see Nakamura Maybe he left already He might be doing something with her Maybe, but it's something important Leaving? No. I'll sing first What for? For Nakamura "Your road leads to hopes" "When the sun comes out again" "On a night when it was drizzling" "The youngsters march off!" "I saw someone peeking through the window" "When the sun comes out again The youngsters march off!" "A railway man wearing a uniform What a clod!" We can't lose "Two, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with two sisters you must lay the elder one first" "Three, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an ugly girl you must cover her face with a bucket" "Four, hey, hey!" "When you get laid upstairs you must be careful not to make noise" "Five, hey, hey!" "When you lay a gal you often meet Don't use any unusual tricks" "Six, hey, hey!" "When laying a dear old friend..." "Eight, hey, hey!" "When laying a vegetable peddler's daughter, use a pumpkin for a pillow" "Nine, hey, hey!" "When laying a principal's daughter watch out and don't get expelled" "When laying a girl from a noble family be sure to do it wearing a tuxedo" Is that all? "Eleven, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with Takako Tanigawa..." Stop! "Will you come in or will you leave? Which" "Please decide quickly" "Make up your mind and come in" "Mister, tissues are expensive nowadays" "Consider what the clerks will think" "So pay them a 50 sen tip" "Then I'll go to bed with you, hold you" "And help you do it another two or three times" "We'll do it until the cock crows" Thank you My name is Ueda Mine is Maruyama Hiroi We came A nice group! Have a good time Thanks for coming A new folk song? Who wrote it? Well An afro song? A Japanese song? "In the ash pit" What? "I let you lay me and that's how it all started" "The boss said he'd give me a tip" "If I put out for him" A woman's song You knew this would happen For me No, I didn't Not at all? "Do it, do it, whatever you wish to do!" "Oh, what shall we do?" "Do whatever you want!" A song of a farmer and his woman Do you know what it means? A man and a woman anytime, anywhere At a boarding house too It wasn't that easy in farm villages and coal mines I did it near a corpse They had to sing a special song to get in the mood Like we did just now I'm different Female coal miners wore only underwear when going to work Their underwear was so short their knees showed Like that, they went down into the mines When they came up, men went down They always touched the girls' thighs The woman tapped their thighs and laughed One day a young man started work The women teased him too He blushed and went down Only one of the women was kind to him They got to know one another though they never spoke "Do it, do it, go ahead..." They met only in the mine They petted in the abandoned parts In spring, she asked him to meet her parents She proposed to him "Do to me whatever you like..." They met above ground so he could meet her folks "What'll we do?" Know what happened? "Do to me whatever you like..." It's dark underground And it's hard to work Disaster can strike anytime Lovers are forced to part Tomorrow may never come The man who told me that died, too Otake? Seven years ago The man visited the woman only to find she'd died She died that day? She died before she ever met him Her parents told him he'd meet her in spirit Spirit? So he married her gravestone And lived with her parents He only dreamed it? No. He actually married her gravestone About me You imagined you'd killed Otake But it's over One more thing You killed someone? I violated a woman What? Maruyama, Ueda, Hiroi and I did it in our imagination What was she? They went to tell her What for? I wonder what they're doing They went to tell her what they imagined? They have sexual desire Who's the woman? Someone better than a female miner Let's go Why? We'll go For their sake? No For her sake? For our sake Our sake? For you and me, respectively Why that dress? They had her? Damn it! What's wrong? Stop! Fools! Let's go Sit down That's her? Did you tell her what you imagined? You did? That's why this happened to Kaneda? We couldn't Sorry for before Peaceful coexistence Have some Nakamura It hurts, doesn't it? It's better to hurt I don't feel anything anymore When Otake dies, I wasn't sure if I was really sad I was with him seven years but we never married I imagined married life with him But it was only an imagination It's not a different way of thinking We had no time or place to share our pain If we'd married, he wouldn't have died If I'd been able to feel pain he'd be alive I killed him I killed him Kaneda, don't forget today's pain Never, all right? I wonder if she understood That Korean gown? Hers 1949. I was born June 1960. I was born again Women and blood It's 1967. We're still in the hands of God On January 1 God gives life even to a girl who has no reason to live January 15 The girl has a paper in her hand It's gone in only a moment In freezing February God teaches love to girls He teaches boys death "The dark sun is starting to rise" "1967, spring in Japan" We raped you "That day, peach blossoms died" "The throats of nightingales were ripped apart" We violated you "Don't stop loving" In that classroom! "Don't let go of what you have" We stripped you "Love in freezing February" We violated you. Believe us! "We learned death in freezing February" Don't you believe? "The festival of the dark sun is near" "The year 1967... spring in Japan..." "Take the festival by force Shoot the sun" "With your tender love and cruel death!" Let's go Let's go to the imaginary classroom Now, do exactly as you'd imagined 2,627 years ago, on February 11 Emperor Jimmu became Japan's first monarch His name means "the first ruler of Japan" Another emperor had the same name: Sujin, Japan's 10th monarch In history it's recorded that Sujin also had another name: "The Ruler of Mimaki" Mimaki means a palace in Mima "One, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with an only child Where's Mima? Mima was the ancient name for Korea "Two, hey, hey!" "When you sleep with two sisters you must lay the elder one first" Princess Kushiinada became pregnant She chose a place to bear her child She came here to Kumagaya a very dark and deep valley and declared it the place The father of the child she would bear was Prince Susanoo When he went to kill an 8-headed dragon he turned her into a comb and carried it with him Prince Susanoo stopped in Shiragi then moved to Japan So goes the legend Shiragi was in southern Korea From the third to fifth century The Mounted Tribe from northeast Asia dominated Manchuria Mongolia and north China and they conquered Korea Then they landed in west Japan At that time the Izumo Tribe enjoyed a rich culture in Japan They built a huge shrine It's two times taller than the buildings we have today The great structure towered to the sky But the Izumo Tribe was banished by the Mounted Tribe The great shrine fell into the Japan sea The Japanese had their origins in Korea The Japanese had their origins in Korea During a 7th century coup d'etat a prince killed the prime minister It terrified the Crown Prince He staggered into his room saying "A foreigner killed the prime minister I am devastated" In that case "foreigner" meant "Korean" "A Korean killed the prime minister I am devastated" What did "A Korean killed the prime minister" mean? The original Japanese came from Korea and conquered the land The coup was to banished the Izumo Tribe "Ten, hey, hey!" "When laying a girl from a noble family be sure to do it wearing a tuxedo" Take me Wait a minute They imagined they violated me Don't fool me Try. See if you can really do it Go ahead Bitch! Through? Is this real?
