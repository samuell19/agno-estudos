Hey. Hey, Coach Jacoby. What are you kids up to? Oh, nothing. Just some extra credit, you know. The school's closed. And that goes for your newspaper. You're gonna have to leave. - Now. - All right, cool. Thanks, coach. - Hey. - I just feel like I'm cracking up. I know it's tough, but we shouldn't blame this on a bunch of ghost stories. I don't know what to believe. These just seem like awfully big coincidences. They're odd, I'll give you that. They're either accidents, or there's a killer out there. There's no ghost. But there is something. I mean, there's something connecting this to what happened to me... ...to those girls in '69. We're gonna find out what it is. Grace Taylor is gonna tell us. - This is it? - Yeah, it's groovy. Come on. Power to the people. Free Angela Davis. What's up? Hi, I'm Sam, and this is my brother, David. - So? - So we wanted to talk to you. Miss Taylor, we wanted to talk to you... ...about what happened at homecoming 35 years ago. Power to the people. Right on. You take your shoes off. Have a seat, kiddies. You want some tea? - No, thank you. - Penicillin? Oh, yeah, we would love some... ...tea. So, what do you kiddies want to know about that night? Well, we were hoping you could tell us everything. "Professor at Alpine University kills his own students... ...using urban legends as his m.o." There were five of them, including that devil bitch, Dawn. Gina and I were tricked, drugged and left 20 miles from home in the woods... ...all because we didn't worship them like the rest. Everyone said that we just got wasted and passed out. No one wanted to cop to the truth. That happened to me too. I know. I read it in the papers. But you all came back in one piece. My best friend... ...never came home. Get that. - It's Mary. - What is? The murders. It's Mary Banner. Looks like urban legend, but it's Mary. - But she's dead, isn't she? - Oh, she's dead, all right. But her energy, her life force, is very strong. Always was. You kids know that nothing ever dies, don't you? It just changes form, you know, like water into ice into water into steam... ...into water into ice, you dig? Wait, so you're saying... ...a ghost is killing these kids. But that doesn't make any sense. Why would she be killing us? Why not just go after the people who actually did this to her? The children will always suffer the sins of their fathers. Your friend Heather had a devil-bitch mother by the name of Dawn. Well, Mary wants revenge on the five people who took her youth... ...so she's taking their children. That's where she's starting. Who knows where she'll stop. She has always had to have her way. Come on, you're not buying this, are you? Miss Taylor... ...we need to know the names of the boys who did this to you... ...and to Mary. Oh, baby. I can barely remember how to tie my shoes... ...let alone the names of our dates. But they were all on the football team. This is ridiculous. - I cannot believe you believe her. - I can't believe you don't. This is as bad as when you thought there was a vampire... ...living under the porch. - I'm starting to wonder if I was right. Kidding. Heather's mom went to Worthington, so we can assume she was involved... ...along with Roger's and Tom's dads. So we have to figure out who's next, probably Buck. Sam, Mary Banner isn't killing people. She's dead. It's more likely that Grace Taylor is doing this. Look at these. - Did you steal these? - Yeah, just look at them. The handwriting is just like on the envelope that was sent to Heather. Grace sent the clippings to Heather. This is how Heather died. I saw the spiders, but no one believed me. This one's a girl, but the same thing happened to Roger. Oh, God. They're all coming true. Oh, God. We have to find Buck. He won't be hard to find. Let's get out of here. - Buck, we need to talk to you. - What? You gonna write about me in the newspaper? - No, I just think that... - Come on. I'm sorry that we played a stupid fucking joke... ...on you and your friends. But did Roger and Tom and Heather deserve to die for it? Do you honestly think I could kill someone... ...over a stupid, asshole jock prank? Look, Buck... ...do you know about the kidnappings at Worthington High in 1969? That was something that he did when he was young. It's like a rite of passage. - Wait, you're talking about your dad? - Yeah. My dad was pissed about the picture you put in the paper. And the article. He told me about how he and his friends would have handled it. So Coach Jacoby was one of the boys... ...involved in the kidnappings? The Mary Banner case? Yeah, but he didn't hurt her. He didn't even know what happened to her. She just disappeared. She didn't die like Heather did. Buck, I'm sorry. All right, come on, we gotta get out of here. Let's go. We gotta get the heck out of Dodge. I'm worried about Buck. Well, he's a source of worry, I agree. I think that Buck's dad killed Mary Banner. I think he's lying to Buck. Oh, and I'm sure you got this info directly from Mary Banner. Well, I saw Coach Jacoby at her grave after Roger's funeral. Wait a minute. You think Coach Jacoby had something to do with these murders? No, I mean, not directly. I just think that... What? You were gonna say something. This might sound strange, but I think... She thinks that the ghost of Mary Banner is killing people. Guys, if either of you have information, real information... ...you better stop fooling around and tell me. - Just like that. - Oh, baby. You're so nasty. - Yeah, that's it. - Spank me. That's it. Oh, yeah. - So good. - You love it. Oh, yeah. - So big. - Come on. - Right there. Right there. - Yeah. Shit. Damn it. Under. Okay. What the hell? Holy shit. Oh, Jesus, Chewy, did you eat another skunk? - That's right. - Oh, God. Don't stop. Don't stop. Come on. Right there. You like it, huh? Hey, don't look now, but Coach Jacoby's crying. - Maybe something happened to Buck. - Maybe someone cut his kidneys out. - Hey. - Long time no see, Sam. Have you guys seen Buck? - Have we seen Buck? - Yeah, his dad looks really upset. Yeah, well, Buck got himself good and killed last night. Yeah, I heard he got crushed under a vending machine. He tried to snag some free chips, and then smash. Did your mother drink while she was pregnant? In the news, they said he got his throat cut... ...by a prostitute in some sleazy motel. Wait. Buck's dead? Maybe you shouldn't be so concerned with his well-being. He certainly wasn't concerned with ours. Four down. One to go. Are you still looking for clues? God, you were fat. Did you know that Grandpa was bald? Guess you can kiss your hairline goodbye. Yeah, and Grandma has a moustache. I think Heather was trying to tell me something. We know that her mom was one of the people involved... ...in Mary Banner's disappearance. Why don't we ask Heather's mom who the other boys were. Yeah, and then what? And then we'll know who's left on Mary Banner's hit list. Sam, I appreciate your community spirit... ...but most people in this town don't. - Most people think... - I'm one bolt short of a nutcase. That I should have been drowned at birth. Yeah, in that general direction. Where are you going? We need to talk to the police, but we need evidence. I'm going back to see Grace. Oh, that's smart, walk straight into the jaws of death. I don't think she's the killer anymore. She's afraid to leave her house. But I think she knows who the killer is. - Okay, call me. - Yeah. Hello? Grace... ...are you here? Shit! You scared me to death. What are you doing in my house, X-Man? How did you get in? - The door was open. - Oh, yeah. For the cats. You're lucky. You almost got sprayed with bug spray. Hit. What do you want? Spit it out. I really need you to tell me the name of the football players... ...who abducted you all those years ago. Please, Grace. I wouldn't tell then, I won't tell now. Did anyone ever tell you that you look exactly like Foxy Brown? That's smooth, brother. Very smooth. You know... ...anyone who wanted to could have found out who those boys were... ...just by looking at the pictures in the school archive. In the archives? Right on, Gracie. Thank you. Damn it. Oh, my God! Willy. Willy! Willy! Don't leave me in here, Willy. Willy! Willy! There's Grace. Where's Mary? Hello, Mary. Who's your date? There he is. Holy shit. No. No, stop. Leave me alone. No. Leave me alone! Grace. Grace, you need to get a phone that works. Grace, please. Please. What does Mary want with me? Mary's visited you too, huh? Find her. Find her and bury her. But I saw her grave. You saw a tombstone, baby girl. She's not buried there. Gina and I looked for her for years. Nobody ever found her body. She could be anywhere. I think I know where she is. I hope this is what you want. Sam! Samantha! Hey, it's the Owens. Leave a message. David, are you there? David, if you're there, pick up the phone. David. I think I know where the body is. I know... I know you think I'm crazy, but... This is the one piece of evidence that we need to bring it to the cops. When you get this message, meet me at the school, okay? You have my keys. Meet me at the side door. I forgot to tell you. Your brother went over to the school. Great. He has my keys. You're just gonna have to take me in your car. No way. I have not been back there since homecoming, 1969. Please. I would take my bike, but it'll take me too long. No, I can't! Look at me. Grace. Damn. You have to promise me that you will bury her when you find her. David! David, open the door! - David! - Shit. David, open the door! David? I saw someone in there. - Was it Mary? - I don't know. Maybe. I'm gonna climb through the window. I'll go around and open the door for you. No, hey, I'm cool. I'll wait in the van. Oh, damn. Shit. Grace, I got her. Grace, wake up. Shit. I found her, Grace. Grace, I really need your help. Grace. Shit. Damn, that's some chronic. Shit. Grace. Oh, no. Oh, Grace. Are you okay? Oh, shit. Grace. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. - Hello? - Bill. - Bill, thank God. - Sam, where are you? - I'm at the cemetery. - Calm down... Sweetie. - Your mother... Sam, what's going on? - What? I can't hear you. You're in a what? - I can't hear you. - Where are you? I'm at the cemetery. Fuck. Fucking cell phones. Bill. Thank God you're here. I really need your help. All right, just calm down and tell me what's going on. I found the body. Now I have to bury it. Mary Banner's body. I finally found it, and now she wants me to bury the corpse. Here, sweetheart, I got it. This ground's frozen. Okay, I just don't want you to worry about this. I'll take care of it. Everything will be fine. Did you hear that? That might be Coach Jacoby. Don't worry about him. I can take care of him. Does anybody else know about this body? No, just me and David. Did you say anything to your mom? Samantha. Someone, help! Someone, help me! - Did you tell your mom? - No. - Help! - You leave her alone! Get out of here, baby! Go on! Willy Owens. You're gonna go down. You wait until the city council hears about this. Samantha! Come on, sweetheart, I don't want to hurt you. I just wanna talk. Samantha! I'm sorry I hit you. I... I have a problem with anger management, but I'm okay now. What's gonna happen to your mother if I go to jail? Because she won't have David anymore... ...because David is dead. You're crazy! What the...? Grace. I... Far out. No one is ever gonna believe us. Samantha. Follow the tracks down the hill. Hey, now. - I fall asleep again? - Yep. Bill. You mean "punk." They're saying he died of a heart attack. I guess something must have scared his butt real bad. You gonna be okay? I guess this will just be another ghost story. Something to talk about around campfires and slumber parties. Baby girl, you're the urban legend now. A decades-old mystery was finally solved last night... ...when police discovered the body of mayoral candidate Bill Owens... ...dead of a heart attack while apparently attempting... ...to dispose of the remains of Mary Banner... ...a local girl who disappeared over 30 years ago. While police refuse to confirm it, a source tells us... ...that it was Owens who was actually responsible... ...for Banner's death on that fateful homecoming night in 1969.
