Astonished? The boy grew up. - Letters. Last night, Duke Fergus left Titus Morell clean. There were strong bets, quick play, with the promise that there will be more. - Horseshoe Brown was the last one ... - We should give you what you deserve. The last one to find out the speed of Montana. Fergus took less time to close the stall of what it took to open it. Shanghai Kelly was the worst took on Duke Fergus's visit. Shanghai had requested it and ... - Are they all the same? - More or less. - Thank you darling. - Well, where is he tonight? - With Calico Jim. - Don't play with Fergus. It's not Calico, it's Joe Disko. - Very unintelligent. - What's wrong? The Chamber of Commerce reported that San Francisco is the seventh largest city with 425,000 inhabitants. The Metropolitan Company will move to San Francisco. - I would have to learn to read. - You would be amazed. Including those of today, January 10, 1906. What does it mean in simple language? That San Francisco is suffering for growing up. She wants to be beautiful. She wants to be big. Have an opera. You do not want us. Always with the same song. What do they get? Anything. Until it occurred to her to bring Joe Disko to fill the press. - To recover. - We should give you the deserved. You talk too much. Calico says to go by noon, If you want to see the show. It's ok. Let's go. - It's very bad, Calico. "Maybe, but my way." Do you mind if I look? I love this look. I'll want the next one up. - It's like calling me thief before witnesses. Yes. I'll give you 30 seconds to apologize. - How slow I am. - I'll redeem these unless that has another player. - Watch out, the police. - Take him behind the bar. - Bring chairs. Orchestra! Do you play with us? - It will be a pleasure. Well, Calico. What is all this? $ 100 dollars a hand, Casey, can you afford it? Four blue ones. - It's good this way! - Are you looking for something? Do not. Oh no. The last time you looked over my shoulder i lost my ... I'm lost. What are you doing? - Building a road. - Until where? - My new home. - How big, huh? - Twice as big as that. How backyard? And no mice in the cupboards. You are very funny. Why did you come back? You said you'd be back. I took him for a naive. A man is naive for knowing what you want? "If she knows she can't have it." - I don't see it that way. For you will see. Are you going to the city? Take me? Clear. Hoaa. It's like a mansion converted into a beautiful casino. - Do you want to see inside? - Of course. Pretty. With that, will close all locations on Rua Pacífic. I think so. - What do you want to demonstrate? - That when I want something I get it. What do you want I do not know? - I'll make it? - Get what? - My diva. - I already have a contract. Flaxen, look around you. Don't you think after you do All this a contract will stop me. One that, surely. There are rats in the cupboards. All this for me? It's flattering, but would rather that I had not done. - Because? - This is not your game. One of these days will get heavy. Or be fed up and go away. Maybe not do it alone. I'm not going anywhere. I already found my place. One dollar gives a coat. THE curtain will rise with a new contract. We should get rid of Duke Fergus. We try, and the customers they put on their hats. - Duke Fergus wants to see you. - We must... That we should give you what he deserves. Yes Hello. Hello. - Calico and Kelly's complaints? - Few. - What about that horse? The only thing that makes me like You often think the same. Oh yeah? Well, how about the Silver Dollar? - Ready for the grand opening. - If it comes to inaugurate. That is my intention. In mid-April. Do you have your star? - How much you ask me by Flaxen's contract? One dollar more than that you can afford. - Something like? - I do not care. - I offer to buy the contract, I also talked to my lawyer. He says it's not worth nothing if it takes you to court. I could also say. You may have everything you want. - What is the price? - Don't even dream, Duke. Without Flaxen you are nothing. No other would do the silver dollar is worth it. Perhaps. - Why are you so serious? - I was thinking... - If I want you? - Something like. Do not give too much importance. Have you heard that they offered me to be the Silver Dollar diva? He believes this It's what you deserve. I want more money. And a new coat. And a bathtub in the dressing room. And it may be that Don't be kidding. It may be better to be better as you go as you grow. - I want you too. - Really? No, no. A moment comes in a woman's life where you should give a punch in the man. Have you ever given look at the silver dollar? - For what? Not will never inaugurate. - It's a lot of money. - Shut up now. - I'm not liking. - What matters? - Much if you want to follow. - What do you mean? - The Silver Dollar is next door. - Stop talking bullshit. - You will focus where you are ... - Yes? Tito! Neither of you nor of any man alive. Get closer. And I want one bathtub in the dressing room. It's weird, doesn't it seem to you? Not entirely. - The Silver Dollar is a great place. - Not so big. Have a great concept of herself. - Hmm-hmm, and I never lie. Why fool us? I wanted Flaxen, you has. Do not need me. - That's what I say. - See what I mean? - Are you going to do something about it? - Get out of here, asshole. - I suppose you are aware that this It will cost you a lot of money, Tito. Yes, I know that. The boss is waiting for you. - Who? - That Duke Fergus, ma'am, wants to see you. - Of course. - I'll see you later. - A bathtub here and with bubbles. Miss Flaxen says that to him will receive shortly. Can I use your phone? - There is? A ... this thing? Give in crank until you hear, 'Here's the bar' - Hello? - It's Mr. Fergus. They are coming? Yes, with big carriages. It's been going in since midnight. - Sugarplum... You are very Elegant, Mr. Fergus. This is the first time See you with a tuxedo. And the first time the visa. To sit down, put yourself the "get out" like this, or like this? - Is happy? - More or less. Should be.

Tom Bockman, President from MidPacific Stinge. - Delighted, Tom. - Fred Madman, it's from oil. Kept your promise, It is better than any location. - You think? - Does the show start late? - What do you think...? "Oh, Flaxen won't be long." It's never too early for Tom. Look who is talking. I happen not to declare until Flaxen rejected you 5 times. 4 times, do the math well. - Fred is getting over it. - One moment, I heard right? Everybody asked Flaxen in marriage? Oh-Oh, you too? A new partner for the club. This is Bill O'Hara, owner from Gotham Hotel. Lou Pame, owner from Almacenes Pame. Duncan Barret, brought the train to Oregon. Eddie Andrews did not come.

You put on a show focusing on one woman. Without her, you won't have people even for the entrance. It opens, and this time not even will have a ticket back to Montana. - Is Flaxen in this? - What do you think? I know, but don't even try. - Why not? I think it's a great idea. Wolf, aren't you ashamed? Entering the dressing room a lady like that? "Didn't you know I would?" - Yes. That's what I thought. She is resting. Tito 5 minutes left, Miss. Tarry.

I will be back as soon as possible. - Thank you, doctor. I'd like a coffee? - Yes of course. Do you know him Bucken and Mallon, Mr. Santa and Ben da Commercial Association. How are you? - Bill McGal from Housing. Hello. Thompson Friedman, Neil Thomas and Tom Braile. "He will support Jim Phelan as mayor." - Charmed. - How are you? I better retire, no I want to interrupt the meeting. - It's celebrated for you. - San Francisco is not my city. - I wish it were from Tito Morell? I'm sorry gentlemen, I don't care who rules it. I am going to Montana. And I tread on your heels. This Duke Fergus. He said that will return home. He wasted no time. It's not him that goes away, It's someone who arrives. Who, Tito? And Radmill. Say I want to see you. I told you they were here. Miss Flaxen wants to see you. "I'll see you later, Beulah." But she wants to see you now. - Later. - That told you last time. How dare you come this way? The priorities. I helped Miss to choose the house. - Here's your man. - Tell him what we want. I do not want anything. It's all been your idea. We think about what we are said from Incorporations Barbary Coast. Yes? It is something similar. But rearranged. Tito believes he wants to participate. Don't get into it. You don't look like Alright, huh Tito? I think you are an inept. You're lucky, but you're not prepared for this job. I had no strength enough when you ran? Decidedly not. Didn't you hear Who does Flaxen want to see? Your offer was going with check included? Why are you with us, for a better San Francisco? No. I am against him. - And me too. Thank you, Wolfie. Pleased? Not exactly. With this offer Duke no had no choice but to reject it. What do we mean ... "It's worth nothing without me." Without my money You are a cripple. You use me as crutch since it arrived. Now you are looking for another one. Either take it or leave it. You are weak and I don't have time for you. Hank I will walk. Yes ma'am. Can you believe the word of Duke Fergus anytime. If Duke says put your money on Jim Phelan He told them the truth. Yes sir. Duke Fergus It's the man you trust. If you do not follow the Tito's game is over. Not while Fergus runs the Pacific Street. - Who says he does? I say. What are you going to do about it? - What do we know about the 5th district? - Anything. The ballot boxes are still open. - Should we expect to be closed? - Yes there. - Because? - Duke Fergus has 20 men there. What's on April 1st? - The same. The 22 and the 8 as well. - How's the game at the bar? - Good. The roulette wheels a little slow, a lot of emotion. - They closed the ballot box. - Let's go. - It already is. - Good luck, Mr. Morell. Why, if already do we know the results? - We already know? MS. Flaxen, has no strength to walk around the city. Much less on election night. With more or less strength, she will walk equally. - Do you already know anything about the results? - Not yet. - They should be here already. - Do not worry. - What do you think? - As we had anticipated. Tito has made a Good job on the coast. It has the same margin that Disko and Schmetz. Here we tie. - Give us five more districts and we win. - You already have them. Here are five districts who supported Jim Phelan. "It'll be better when we have them." - Tom, call the city and get a list of the count. - Check these districts and let me know. - They would have to have arrived. - You have already won. - That doesn't set here. - You need five districts to win. - They are safe. - In Tito's pocket. - What do they say, Tom? - Nothing official. Neither will there be, I saw Tito's bullies, they were going there to pick them up. Why did not you say it before? Well, citizens of San Francisco. They try to get them out of town. If you want her, fight for her. - Up to the 5th district - Duke Fergus. They are angry. - Let's get out of here. We're leaving. - We want the clearance maps. - They're not here. - We're done. Without the official documents It's not worth a protest. Why protest? If We registered the votes, I am the mayor. - What about the clearance maps? - In El Dorado. Here we go. "Stay with Mayor Schmetz, the friend of the poor. " Mooring horses, Rudy. - It's going to disaster. - Yes ma'am. You wasted no time. It's just a passing thing. Only temporary. They want you too, Flaxen. - Will you give them the honor? - Who could refuse? - The Five districts? Yes. Good. - What you Did you think she was going to do it? - I had not stopped to think. - That seemed to me. - You go by the count - Because? If you do not know... There is something inside a man that makes you do things, Unpleasant things. For those who do not There is no reward. One cannot always do what he wants. You won't always get it Everything you want. But he can live with I really can. It has to be able to Look in the mirror to shave. - The time has come for .. - You should sell gold, Briggs. - It would make a fortune. That's right, Mr. Denver. - Is that all you can do? - Not. "They want you to come back, me too." - If it's over, Tito. You can't be Seriously, Flaxen. You can not give the back to the one who loves you. It's true, Titus. You can not. I assumed that this Man would be a problem. "Will you marry him?" - I am thinking. - Got a minute to make the decision. I want what you carry it in your coat pocket, Tito. It is the city of San Francisco, and it's mine. There is a population that believes that belongs to her. Like me. Be wise, Duke. A good player Know when to stop. You do well, settle for the winnings. I warn you, Titus. Please, I don't want to do this. You are a good man, Titus, sometimes. The answer is yes. It will cost you a lot of money. For those in the administration, I will double my taxes. - Taxes? I I don't have a penny. Fold those of any other. We're going to Montana. - Montana? - Montana. - You better come. - To Montana? We should give you what you deserve. The headquarters - Allow me?
