- This is your territory and this is ours, but the only thing is, when you were kids you were able to go wherever you wanted. That's not true anymore. We have lock downs and bomb threats. They have police at the doors now. It's like going to prison every day, only a little more fun. They say that there are people out there who want to harm us. And we can never talk to a stranger. Who can we trust? I had to learn the hard way. My name is Dawn. - The body of a young girl was found early this morning in the area of Reservoir, Virginia. The victim was assaulted and stabbed multiple times before before being dumped in a pond. Police report that a woman was walking through the woods when she saw the body... - You okay? - I just dreamed about a girl. She was running, scared to death. I think it's Casey's friend, you know Dawn? I hope she's all right. - What? Wait, who? - Dawn, you know the girl that plays with Peter's daughter, Casey? - Oh yeah, Casey. Is she okay? - No, it's not Casey, it's... Nevermind, it's just a dream. - What's wrong? - What makes you think anything's wrong. - Now how long have we known each other? How'd the interview go on Monday? That bad? Why do I get the feeling that that's not what's bothering you? - It's just a crazy feeling. Have you ever had a dream that just seemed so real. - Sure. - I hate those kind of dreams. Anyway, I've got a lot to get done. Lunch today? - Sounds good. See ya. - Right, bye. - Hey, have I seen you from somewhere bef-- - Keep it moving. - No, I don't think-- - Really? What? - Right. - Probably just arrested her some place. - So we're gonna go out today and let her drive. - What do we got over here? - Oh, that's just the rookies. - Hello, good morning. Little late, bro. Guess the wife hasn't loosened the noose yet, huh? - Noose to you is lovin' in the mornin' for me, my dude. - Whatever, I get mines. Mine just doesn't come with the wife and kids. - You know you're gonna grow old alone, right. - I'll let you tell it. I'll get married when I got nothin' else to live for. - Well well well, if it isn't detective frick and frack. What's up, Spidey? - Wait wait wait wait, Spidey? - You know, Peter Parker, Spider Man? - Is that your real name, man? - Yeah it is, man? You'd be surprised how much play I get. What's your name? - It's Mick. - Right. - How you guys became detectives, I'll never know. - Hey, all it takes is a couple lucky arrests, now look. - Don't be hatin'. Hey, you ready, bro? - Yeah man, just gotta go sign in. And um, you ladies have a great day. - I got your ladies, rookie. - Bye Spidey. - Spidey. - Hey hon. - Hey babe, you still at the office? - Yeah, but I'm leaving now. I know, what a day,. Are you cooking tonight? - Of course. - Thanks hon. I'll see you when I get home. 'Kay, love you. - Love you too. - The body of the young girl that was found in a pond yesterday, in the area of Reservoir, Virginia, has now been identified as 12 year old Dawn Richardson. According to a friend, the victim had been receiving text messages from an older teenage boy who we have found does not even exist. - Carrie. - The body of a young girl was found early this morning in the area of Reservoir, Virginia. The victim was assaulted and stabbed multiple times before before being dumped in a pond. Police report that a woman was walking through the woods when she saw the body floating face down in the water. The woman was very distraught at this gruesome scene and reported it to the police immediately. - The body of the young girl that was found in a pond yesterday, in the area of Reservoir, Virginia, has now been identified as 12 year old Dawn Richardson. - Carrie, please. According to a friend, the victim had been receiving text messages from an older teenage boy. - Hey babe. You're runnin' late. I must have tried to wake you about a dozen times. Must have been some dream. - What about Dawn? Did they find out who did it? - Who did what? Who's Dawn? Is that that little girl that Mary's kid plays with? - They just identified the body. You know the little girl they found in the pond last week? - What girl? There was no girl found in a pond that I know of. Babe, maybe you just had one heck of a dream. Are you gettin' up? It's 7:30. - It just seemed so real. - Thank god it wasn't. You better get movin' if you're gonna make your 9:30 meeting. - I forgot. - Hey babe, I'm headin' out, I'll see you tonight. - Love you. - Love you too. - Isn't he so cute? - I know. And you guys are going to the movies? - He already asked me out. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Oh, he's like... - What movie are you guys gonna go see? - I don't know. - I'll take you straight to-- He wanted me to give this to you. Come on, I promise. - Hello, excuse me, I'm looking for-- - I'm sorry I don't know where that is. - Oh, okay, thanks. - Why's she looking at us? - Good morning Mrs. Saunders. - Who's that? - They wanted directions. - We're late for school. bye. What is up with her? - Who knows. She's usually not so weird. - But you know, okay, so maybe you're getting some kind of warning. - Who is giving me these warnings, God? - You don't think that he could warn you about something that could happen to someone? - I don't know. I mean why me then? Why not someone like you, instead of someone that doesn't really believe. I'm hardly the religious type. - But why not you? You're heart is open, Carrie. - A child? I don't even want kids. I've never been drawn to them, I don't even really care... I guess I'm a terrible person. - No you're not. Maybe that's what he's trying to show you. You care about people more than your realize. - It has been a slow week. No surveillances, no cases, no nothing. So, I mean it's not like I want crime, but... you know? - Pete, what was that man? - She's got some prospects. - You a trip. Nothing but a bunch of old frustrated detectives. - I was having a good lunch. - Dude, at some point man, you gotta settle down and just... Oh, yo, it's cap, it's cap. - At ease, gentlemen. - Hey, Captain. Hey it's the captain, come on over and join us for lunch. You lookin' well, Captain. - Thank you. I gotta go wash my hands, all right. - We'll be here, a'ight. - Such a suck up. - I mean it must work. He gets all the promotions. - Right right. You know dude, you know ever waitress in this entire bar, man. - Yeah I know 'em all a bit too well. Gonna have to find a different bar soon. - Well well well, what do we got here, the crime-fighting duo. And we got Spidey. And you must be the Black Panther. - And you could be like the... I forgot, there weren't any superheroes back in the day. - That's right, it was too long ago. - No, no no no, there was Superman. I don't see why you even started this. You could be like the black version of Lex Luthor. - That's a good one, man, I see that. - With the bald head? - Yeah yeah yeah. - Oh, now you're a comedian. - You two better watch it, you're gettin' a little sure of yourselves. - Sure thing, Catwoman. - Good one, bro. - Are you okay? You seem distracted. - I saw Dawn Richardson this morning. - The girl you dreamed about? - Yeah. In my dream she goes up to this stranger in a car. And then, this morning I see her talking to a stranger in a car. I ran outside, but he took off before I could-- - He? - Well yeah, I think so. I mean I could only see his silhouette. Anyway, my point is, I saw it before it could happen. You know, in these dreams I get a sense that she's in some kind of danger. - Did you say anything to her? - I asked her who it was. But she said he was just asking for directions. She mighta said "they," I don't know. - They? Well okay then, maybe that's what it was. - Maybe. - He's here. - Mr. Saunders, Mr. Saunders, is your wife home? How did she find the body? - Mr. Saunders, Mr. Saunders, do you know who did it? - Mr. Saunders, did you. - Mrs. Saunders, Mrs. Saunders, how'd you find the body? - 'Nother bad dream? Try to get some rest. - Dawn, you should've finished your homework an hour ago, it's 10 o'clock. - I'm almost done. Five more minutes? - Five minutes, and I heard you giggling. No texting friends, okay? - Okay. - Calling for , HR department. Carrie Sanders, okay. Mr. Poindexter, let me see if she's available. It's the gentleman of the copyright job, from last week. - Yes, hi Sam. - I'm calling about the job. - Actually I sent out a letter yesterday. We decided to go with another candidate, but we'll keep your resume on file for future consideration. - But I really need this job. My family depends on me. - I'm really sorry, but we've already made our final decision. Thank you for applying. - Yeah, sure. - Hey babe, you would not believe traffic today. It took me two and a half hours to-- hey. - I think that I should call the police. About the missing girl? Well she's not missing, but-- - Wait, babe, what? - What if something happens and I could have avoided it? - You're serious. - Look I know it sounds crazy, but if there's even a chance. - Carrie, what're you gonna tell them? That some girl you barely know might be in trouble because of a dream? - No, I don't know. - I think going to the police is a bit extreme. You know how this'll make you look. - No, how? - Overreactive, paranoid. - Paranoid? In my dream, I find her body. - Babe, I didn't-- Carrie. - He's here. - Oh my god. Please no, no don't let it be, please. - Carrie! - Think I got something. - Oh please no. - Carrie. - It's all right, it's okay, it was just a dream. Sweetie, who're you calling this time of night? - The police. - The police? Carrie, what're you gonna tell them. - I saw her, Donald, I saw her dead body in a pond. If there's even the possibility that this might happen, then I'll take the chance. - Third precinct. Hello, yes, my name is Carrie Saunders. I'd like to report a possible murder, or maybe an assault on a young girl. - Possible? Did the crime occur or not, mam? - No, not yet, but I have a strong suspicion that it will. - Do you know the girl? - Yes. I mean I don't know her that well, she's my neighbor's friend. - Do you know the alleged perpetrator? - Well no, I've never actually seen him. I've seen his shoes, his pants, and I-- Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I just know someone is gonna try to harm her. - Can you give a description of the man? - No. Look if you just come over, I can explain everything. - What is your address, mam? - Yes, 1161 Morningstar Drive. - We'll send someone by tomorrow. - Yes tomorrow at... - At nine. - Yes, thank you. - Hey man, wait up. Where's the fire? - I just want to get out early for a change. - Was talking to officer Sanchez. Get me some of that. - You ever heard the word fraternization? Ever? - So dude, what's the case? - I don't know, man, some woman called last night claiming that her neighbor's friend was in some kind of danger. - Hmm. - Of course we're the rookies, so, go ask a bunch of meaningless questions about a crime that hasn't even happened yet. - Yet? Okay, so we go, and then I'm thinkin' Chipotle, for lunch. - All right. Why, why Chipotle? - Rumor has is, officer Sanchez's sister works there. - Aren't you a little late for work? - I wanted to... Carrie, I'm so sorry about last night. You're the most together person I know. What time are the police supposed to get here? - They should be here any time. - If you don't mind, I'd like to stay. - Nice house. - Yeah. Hard to believe the lady who phoned this in is some sort of crackpot. - My name is Detective Charles Grant, and this is my partner, Detective Peter Parker. - Peter Parker, that's like-- - Yeah, no relation. - I'm Donald Saunders, and this is my wife Carrie. - Is everything all right, mam? - Yeah, fine, thanks. - So, there's a girl in trouble? - Well I believe she is. Her name is Dawn, Dawn Richardson. Her mother's name is Daisy Rowe. I don't really know her that well, she's friends with our neighbor's daughter, Casey. - Well, seems like you've done your research. - Well I've been having these dreams. - So we see in the report. Tell us about 'em. - I've dreamed that she's being chased by a man. I've even seen her dead in a pond. I'm not sure who he is, but I can see some of what he's wearing. - He? - I believe so. - Can you describe him? - No, not really, the dream is very sketchy. - So you've never actually seen this person? Only in your dreams? - Yeah. - Nervous? - No. I mean I realize what you must be thinking. - And what's that? - I know this sounds crazy, but my wife is not some kind of kook. - We didn't say she was, it's just that-- - It's just that we need more than a feeling or a dream. We need some kind of physical evidence, a text, a phone call. - Well was this time a few days ago, there was a man that stopped Dawn and Casey on the way to the bus stop. Casey said he was just asking for directions, but... - Honey, I thought you said you weren't sure that was a man. - So you can't be sure who was driving? - No. - Getting back to the car incident, you said you didn't believe Dawn and her friend about asking for directions. - Why not? - I don't know, just a feeling. - Unfortunately we can't make an arrest on a feeling. Can you identify the person in the car? Sir, do you have confidence that your wife has cause to believe that this girl is in any danger? Well, Mr. And Mrs. Saunders, if you do have any physical evidence or any information, please give us a call. Unfortunately at this point it is all conjecture. I'm sorry there's nothing we can do. - Told you, dude, totally cray. What's that mental condition where you think the whole world revolves around you? - That mental condition, I think it's called being Peter Parker, last time I checked. - Now we gotta go file a report on a crime that maybe, possibly, could happen. What a waste. - Hi, Mary Ellen? It's Carrie. Fine, thank you. I wanted to... I needed to get ahold of Dawn's mother, Daisy. Yeah, I was talking to her the other day and she wanted to get some information on a job for a friend. Right, and I wanted to male it to her, so I needed her address. Email? Yeah, it's a pretty large packet, it would be hard to scan, about 40 pages. Right, right. Okay. Mm-hm. All right, okay thanks so much. Okay, all right, bye. - I was really worried, why didn't you answer any of my phone calls? - I was out. Getting a cup of coffee. - Well you coulda called to let me know that. - I didn't feel like talking. - Babe, you know I wanna believe you, but there's absolutely no proof that this girl's in any danger. - I know. But what if it's a sign? God's way of trying to send a warning to save this girl? - Carrie, you're agnostic. - I know. All I know is there's something leading me. I can't explain it. I just wish you'd believe me. - Carrie! - Hey babe. You musta been tired. I'll see you tonight. I'll be a little late, I have some work to finish up at the office. Carrie, I'm so sorry I haven't been there. I love you, and I want you to know that I support you. - Thank you. - Nervous? - No. I think going to the police is a bit extreme. You know how this'll make you look. Overreactive, paranoid. - Hey babe, you're late. Company's coming. - We got company? Who? - You forgot? Your mother's coming to dinner. - Yeah, that's probably why. - Now you know you need to stop. You hardly see your mom as it is. She shoulda been here by now. - I'll go get the baby. - No, I'll go. You can answer the phone. - Hello? Yeah. Yeah it has been a while. She had to go get the baby. She's fine. Okay, well I'll let her know. Nah, it's fine. She wasn't planning some big thing anyway. Yep. I know it's been a while. All right, well I'll let her know. Yep, sure, bye. - She canceled. You two had better get it together. This is the third time in two months. What is with you two? Oh, forget I even said that. - It's just we're not that close is all. - You can say that again. If it wasn't for me taking Micha over to her granny's every other Sunday, she would never see her grand daughter. You have got to bury the hatchet. It's a shame she doesn't even feel welcome in her own son's home. Her only son, might I add. - I'm not the one that cancels every time, you know. - That's only because she knows how much you hate to have her come here. You have got to stop blaming her for your father-- - Yeah, let her tell it. Look can we just change the subject? Talk about somethin' else. - Okay. Any new cases at work, dear? - You know I can't tell you everything, but think it's safe to say this is the most unusual case I've seen. Do you believe in precognition? - You know I do. But we call it somethin' else. - We? - You know the people over at my-- - Nevermind. I'll give her her bottle. Pete, you have a desk right here. Why do you need to sleep on my desk? - That's my work desk, this is the vacation area. Parker, victims unit. Parker, victims unit. Uh yes, Mrs. Saunders. Okay, Carrie. Yes, we remember. - Yeah, I was wondering if you had any more information or if you've heard anything about that girl, Dawn. - Uh, no mam, we don't. I'm gonna let you talk it over with Detective Grant. - Detective Grant. Mrs. Saunders, Carrie. - Look Detective Grant, I know you think I'm crazy. - No, not at all, but we don't have a perpetrator. On top of that we have no evidence to believe that anything's gonna happen to this girl. Mrs. Saunders, what I recommend is that maybe you speak with someone, about your dreams. - Speak to somebody. Who, you mean like a psychiatrist? Great, thanks. - Carrie. What is going on, man? - What is with her, man? - I don't know, man. - I'm tellin' you, man, she's a loon. - Starting to believe you on this one. - So you rookies are investigating a murder that hasn't happened yet. You guys are good. - Where does he even come from? - Come outta nowhere. - Carrie. Sorry, I didn't know you were comin' in today. By the way, Rich wants to know if you had a chance to look at the resumes for the graphic arts position? - No, I... Georgette, can you just send any messages to my voicemail for the rest of the afternoon? - Sure. You okay? - Yeah, I just came by to get some paperwork. I'll get back to you about the resumes, I'll call you later. - Hi honey. What're you doin' home so early? - I guess I should be asking you the same question. - Uh, I went to see a friend of mine, a golf buddy. He was just diagnosed with cancer and I just wanted to make sure he was okay. - What's his name? - I'm sorry? - His name. - Les. Leonard, his name's Leonard, but we call him Les. - Where does he live? - Not too far from here, why? - I saw you. - Where? - At the stop light. I know you're usually at work this time in the afternoon, so I was just surprised to see you so early. - It's just so upsetting about Les, I decided to take the rest of the day off. Hey, I'm gonna make dinner tonight. Anything special you might like? - I'm sorry, there's a project that I wanna work on tonight and I just realized I left a file in the office. - What, you're gonna go back out now? - I'm sorry, I won't be gone long, I should be back before seven. - Okay, I'll keep dinner warm. - So you saw him in the car? Are you sure? That doesn't mean that he's doing any-- - No it doesn't, but the fact that he lied about it. - Or didn't tell you. It's a big difference. - He made up some story about visiting a sick friend. - Maybe he was, Carrie. You know your husband, you know how Donald is and what kind of man he is. He's not capable of what you're implying. - Yeah, but do child predators walk around like crazy people? Or are they seemingly normal people with normal lives, families. That's why I kept on dreaming about Dawn. She's in danger from someone I know, someone I love. - That was some errand. It's after nine. Did you find the file. - Oh, no I sure didn't. I must've given it to my assistant, I'll just ask her tomorrow. - You hungry? - No. - You gonna come up to bed? - In a little while, I'm just gonna make a call first. I'm sorry, what did you say? - I just wanted to know if your fiscal year's also your calendar year, and what version of the software you use. - Oh right. Well if you pass the preliminary interview, then you would interview with the CFO and you can ask him more specific questions about the position. - Okay. - All right, well thank you Mrs. Lawson. I will contact the CFO and see if he has time to talk to you later. - All right, thank you so much. - Thank you so much, have a great day. - All right. - Thank you. ♪ No I don't need to be told ♪ ♪ Where I'm gonna go ♪ ♪ 'Cause I already know ♪ Georgette, I have an errand to run, then I'm gonna work from home for the rest of the day, if anyone needs to get in touch with me. Okay thanks. - Is it him again? - Promise me you won't tell. Come on, promise? - Okay. - I'm going to meet Josh after school. - Dawn! You're mom's gonna be really mad if she finds out. - She won't care. She's always too busy anyway. - Okay, so what are you going to tell her? - That I have soccer tryouts. And I'll take the... And I'll take the late bus home, to your house, to study. - I really don't think this is a good idea. What if he's ugly, or a big jerk? - He won't be. - Hi, is Donald Saunders there please? It's his wife. Sorry about what? There must be some mistake. Is his assistant Kelly there? The whole research department? No, okay. No that's all right. Okay, thanks. All right, bye. - Hey, you okay? - I'm sorry, I'm just tired, I just really need to get some rest. - Is there anything I can do? - No, I just need to get some sleep is all. - Isn't that your work number? - Yeah it is. Detective Grant. - Detective Grant, this is Carrie Saunders. I think I know who's gonna hurt Dawn. - Look, Mrs. Saunders, I just, I really don't think that it... Mrs. Saunders. Carrie. - Is that your unusual case? - Yeah it is. Look, I'm, I'm just gonna get some fresh air. - Why, where are you going? Charles, where are you going? I thought we were gonna watch a movie tonight. - Won't be late, 'kay? - What up? You're here late. - Sup man. Yeah about to lose 50 bucks on this stupid game. - What'll you have? - I'll have the usual. A rum and coke. - What? Who is that? Isn't she a little old for you? - It was dark. Should I card every girl I go with now? - Nah, man, it's uh... It's crazy, you know that weird case, the one with the lady and the dreams? - I'd like to forget, but yeah. - She called me, said she knows somethin' about who's gonna get the girl. It's been bothering me. - Okay, who? - I don't know, she hung up. - Good. Look, there is no perp, there's no stalker, except for the one in her head. Go home, and get in bed with your beautiful wife and forget about this case. There is no case. - Yeah man. No you're right I mean. I'll go home and I'll get in bed with my beautiful wife, right after I lose 50 bucks on this stupid game, man. - Dance with me. - Okay. - Yeah Pete. It's all about the single life, man. - Who won? - Not my team. - You need to stop betting on those games. - Babe, that's my only vice. - True, I am blessed. - Yeah. - Can you please go and brush that beer off your breath? - It's like that? - Yeah. - All right. - Dawn. - Carrie. Carrie. - Charles, what did you do, sleep here? - Yeah, almost. - Who's this? - It's Dawn. - So she does exist. So the lady's only half cray. How'd you find her if you've never seen her? - Can you keep a secret? - You know me. - Yeah, exactly, that's why I'm asking you to keep this to yourself, all right, Pete? - Yeah yeah, I got it. So what's up? - I dreamed about her last night. - Seriously, that's weird. - Ah man, she was playing and, outta nowhere the dream completely changed. And it was like she was bein' chased by someone. It's weird. - Okay bro, well, maybe it was like that crazy lady, Mrs. Uh... - Saunders. - Yeah, her. Maybe these dreams are contagious or something. - But how did I have a dream, and saw this girl, wearing this same exact dress? How does that happen? - You know how the mind plays tricks. Maybe you forgot you saw her. Forget it, there's nothin' here. - How did you sleep? - Fine. - Carrie what's wrong? - I called your office yesterday. I usually call your cellphone, but you've been so hard to get ahold of. Why didn't you tell me? - Carrie. - You've been lying to me for how long now? - I was laid off six weeks ago. - Your company does away with its whole research department, which includes you, and you decide not to tell me. So what've you been doing these past six weeks? - Carrie, I've been with this company out of college. It's all I know. No one's gonna hire a man my age at my salary. - You still didn't answer my question, what've you been doing? - Looking for another position, of course. But it's been difficult, trying to find a position at my level. So now I'm thinking about starting my own-- - I saw you. - Saw me? What're you talking about? - At her school. At Dawn's school. I saw you outside her house, what are you doing? - I'm not doing anything, Carrie, it's not what you think. I was trying to help you. - How is stalking a little girl helping me? - This whole thing with this girl, it's consuming you. I wanted to help, to see if someone was actually after her. - And I'm supposed to believe this? - Yes! - Why? You've been lying to me this whole time, why should I start believing you now? - Because you know me, Carrie! We've been married for 16 years! You know that I could never hurt that little girl. - Then why couldn't you tell me what you were doing? - Because I wanted to see... I don't know. I thought maybe if I was wrong you wouldn't have to know. Carrie, if you could just listen to me for a minute. Someone is following her, you're right. He drives a black car. I don't know, maybe he's a parent of someone at the school. But I have seen the same car in Dawn's neighborhood, Carrie! - Hi hon, guess who's here. - Hello stranger. - Hey. - Well aren't you gonna give your mother a hug? - Aw, now see, that didn't hurt a bit. Look, I'll let you two catch up. I'm gonna go ahead and check on Micha. - Well it's been quite some time, hasn't it? - Yeah. - You know I didn't come here to make you feel uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, I didn't come here to discuss family matters at all. - Then why? - Charles. - No Avery, it's okay. I need to get going. - No! Now come on you two, you have got to talk about your father. - Really? - I don't think Charles wants to hear about his father. - Which one? - If you really wanna hear the truth about your father, you can call me any time. - Thought you were gonna ask Charles about the dreams. - No, another time. Good night Avery. Kiss Micheal for me. - What dreams? - The body of a young girl was found early in a pond, approximately one half mile off Crown Manor Drive, near route 40 in Reservoir, Virginia. - No! - You okay? Another dream? - Yeah. - Why do I have the feeling it's something more than that? - I'm having dreams about a girl. - Anything I should know about? - No no, it's not like that, I'm having dreams about the girl in my case. Carrie, the lady that called yesterday, she's havin' dreams about a girl, and I'm having dreams about a girl I've never met before and it just makes me think. What if it's the same girl? - What happened, in the dream? - She's murdered. - God, you have to let someone know. - Tell what, Avery? That I'm havin' dreams about a girl that's gonna get murdered and they need to invest-- No, I mean they would laugh me out of the department. - You know what I believe? I believe that this is God's way of trying to warn you about-- - If I go in with that, they'll laugh me out of the department, and they'll try to get me some help. Look, let's just get some rest and I'll deal with it. - Okay. - So you know officer Sanchez wants me, right? She told officer Williams, who told Loraine the dispatcher, who told-- - Officer Sanchez does not want you, man. - Oh, so you are listening. Good to know. So what's up man, what's goin' on? - Nothin', nothing' man, it's just I had another dream about the girl. - Okay. So what happened this time? - Same thing. Avery thinks that... I don't know man, she says that God is trying to like, say something, to me. - God is talking to... Okay, so what's he saying? - That the girl is in danger, isn't it obvious? - But like, if it's god, shouldn't he send a burning bush or something? - Gosh, man. - I'm just sayin', bro, everyone knows, burning bush, or he sends an angel, somethin' like that. - Just forget I said anything. - No no no no no no, come on, now let's explore this. 'Cause you know if you talk to anybody else in the station, except me of course, they will laugh you right out onto the street. - Anyway look, nothing's happened to the girl so it's mute at this point anyway, so, let's just change the subject, talk about somethin' else. - Okay. So you know Sanchez is in love with me, right? - In your dreams, my friend. - I saw him, the detective was in my dreams. Grace, I'd never seen him before in my life, I mean what does that mean? - Did you tell him? - No, then he really woulda thought I was crazy. - What about Donald? - I'm not saying much of anything to Donald these days. You know, I mean 16 years of marriage and I feel like I'm living with a stranger. - Carrie I know things look bad right now, but everything with this girl was purely coincidental. And I refuse to believe that Donald could harm anyone. - I mean yeah, I wanna believe that. - Could be someone else. - What's up detective? Aw come on, don't be like that. We all on the same team. Now this case of yours, I know how hard it is, working when all you have is one half-baked Loony Toon. But what I heard is she's having dreams of someone killing her neighbor. - Yeah, somethin' like that. - So what does Charles think about this so called witness? - I guess he's not sure. Especially since he started having the same weird dreams. - Really, what dreams? - Some girl he claims he's never seen, never met. Someone's trying to get her. Thinks God is trying to tell him something important. Or was it his wife? - Wow, that's deep man. So what're you gonna do about it? - Look, no one's supposed to know what I just told you, so just keep it to yourself, okay? - Hey bro, you can trust me. - The body of a young girl was found early in a pond, approximately one half mile off Crown Manor Drive, near route 40 in Reservoir, Virginia. - Let her go. Let her go or I swear I'll shoot, let her go. - No. - Charles, it's me, Avery. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay, babe. - I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I don't know what's gotten into me, I just... Oh babe, I'm sorry. - Come on, let's go to sleep. - Captain, this rookie's talkin' about dreams, now God. We need to get rid of this rookie. - Cap, you said you wanted to see me? - Yes, close the door and take a seat. Look, I appreciate you and Parker taking the case on the girl, but I received some troubling information from another detective. About you saying you're having dreams about the girl and making claims that God is telling you the girl is in danger. - Cap I, I can explain. I did say I had a dream about the girl. But I never said anything about God or-- - It doesn't matter who said what. It's going around the department, and that makes us look bad. So listen. If you don't see any indication that this case should continue, I need you to close it. - But Cap, it just a big misunderstanding. - Possibly. But I want it closed just the same. - Yes mam. - You're dismissed. - Hey Mary, how's it goin'? - Great. How'd it go with that job for Daisy's friend? - What? Oh, yeah, just fine. - Well, I spoke with Daisy about it, she had no idea what I was talking about. She wanted to know why you needed her address. I told her you're not a stalker. - Well I certainly appreciate that. I can explain. I was concerned about Dawn. - Dawn? - Yeah, I know this is gonna sound totally crazy, but I've been having these dreams... You know what, I'd appreciate if you could just forget the whole thing. - It's your boss, Rich. - Hi Rich. Well yes, I've been working from home. The graphic artist position? Yes, I've been working on-- Of course. Tomorrow at 8:00 am? Sure, I'll see you then. Hi Daisy? It's Carrie Saunders. I spoke to your friend Mary. It's actually about your daughter Dawn. Please give me a call as soon as you can, thanks. - Not a stalker, huh? Right. - So how's the case goin', detective? - It's goin' fine, man. - Sure it is, you're a great detective. No no, really, no you're a great detective and all, kinda arrogant. But overall competent. - Whatever you say. - See that's what I'm talkin' about. - And what's your story, Roy, hm? What are you, some burnt out detective that couldn't collar a case if his life depended on it? Frustrated by young men like myself, because we've not only caught up to you, but surpassed you? You are such a cliche man. Waiting for retirement, having fun along the way at my expense, but I take it back, because to say that you're burnt out, I think that would imply that you actually did some kind of work over the course of your career, and I'm pretty sure we both know that's not the case. - You know everything. And maybe again, maybe you do. - What, what the hell is this? - You hear directly from God, right? Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses. - Part the Red Sea. Moses, Moses, Moses. Moses. - And to think that I was stupid enough to trust you. - It's Moses. Don't worry about him, you're in the clan now. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. The game's comin' on soon. - You been out here the whole time? - Yeah. - Pete's been callin' for hours. I told him I had no idea where you were. What's wrong? - I'm sorry, it's, it's just kinda funny when I think about it. I'm the laughing stock of the department, all thanks to my man Pete. - You're drunk? - Yup. - Baby this is definitely not like you. Not answering your best friend's phone calls, sittin' out here gettin' drunk? - So now you're my mother? Avery, when you do that right there, that part I just, I can't stand. When you do that. - You know what, you sound like some spoiled little kid right now. Man up. Stop your whining before I call your mother on you. - You what, what? Are you serious? You're serious. Pete told that jerk Roy, that I was havin' dreams about the girl and that God was tellin' me stuff. - Okay. - You don't see how that makes me look? - Who cares what he thinks? Stand up for what you believe in. If you believe that these dreams are real, then do something about it. - They think I'm some religious fanatic. My credibility is done, my career is over. - No, no it's not. - It's over, my career is over. - No it's not, not to those who matter. - Thanks sweetie, that means so much. - Aren't you gonna answer it? - Oh yeah, I'll answer that. I'm goin' to bed. All right, just, can you make sure you turn the lights off and stuff? - Hi Pete. - Avery, yeah I know. Uh, just have Charles call me back. - Sure. - Yeah thanks. - Hello, Grace? - Hey Dan. It's Pete. Can you do me a favor? Yeah, I need an address on a Dawn Richardson. She goes to Lawson Middle. Yeah, thanks man. Just call me on my cell. Okay. - Where're you goin'? - Got some stuff to take care of. - You don't really believe this do you? Only way to make it in this department is to drop him. - Get you a new partner. - Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you. - Let's just face it, he's on his way out anyway. - You know, you really should lay off the kid. - These rookies gonna run this department into the ground. - Is that that little girl that Mary's kid plays with? - He's not capable of what you're implying. - It's just that we need some kind of physical evidence, a text, a phone call. - I'll be a little late, I have some work to finish up at the office. - Have you heard anything about that girl, Dawn? - We have no evidence to believe that anything-- - Dawn. - Dawn. I should have remembered to. - God, please save Dawn. Please help me to help her. I'll do whatever it takes. If she really is in danger and I'm not crazy, please, please help me. - Sorry girls, I made you late again. - Anything else new? - I heard that. Okay, see you this afternoon. Oh great, I have to show a property at 3:30. - It's okay, I have soccer tryouts today. I'll just take the late bus home to Casey's house. - You like soccer? Casey, I'll call your mom to make sure it's okay for Dawn to come for a little while, okay? - Sure Mrs. Rowe. - See you tonight. - How'd the meeting with your boss go? - Richard said he's concerned about my erratic behavior. All the time I've been taking lately. I've been put on a leave of absence. So I can quote unquote, get it together. - I'm so sorry, honey. Is there anything I can do? - No. - Carrie, talk to me! - About what? - What's goin' on? - Baby, now don't be mad at me. I called your mom last night. - You called my mother on me? You really called my mother on me, I cannot believe this. - I wanted to stop by. Avery told me about everything that was going on at work, and the problems and the dreams? I hope you don't mind. - Great, thanks hon. - She also told me about the girl in your dreams that's the same girl in your case. - Yeah it's just coincidence. Just some weird, freakish-- - Coincidence? - This woman keeps calling saying she's having dreams, premonitions about some girl gettin' murdered. It's just some crazy type of stuff, it's really not a huge thing. - You don't believe her? - I don't know. I don't know, it's just that every time I try-- - Go on, tell her baby. It's somethin' up with this little girl. I don't know what, but God is tryin' to tell him somethin' and he ain't listenin'. All I know is, y'all better get it together before this little girl is found-- Okay, I'll be quiet. - What is it? - My friend, she's been having dreams about a girl. She's running through the woods, someone's chasing her, and then she finds her dead in a pond. - A pond? Your friend, what's her name? - Carrie. - I knew it, I knew something was goin' on. I should be the detective. - Carrie. I'm callin' about Dawn. I'm here with your friend Grace, Grace Hensly. She's also my mother. I don't think this is coincidence. And I've been havin' the same dreams. I hope you get this message. - Where're you going Charles? - Where's my holster? - It's in the closet. Charles, where are you going? - Be right back, a'right? I'll be back. I love you. - There's a man hunt underway now for a suspect. - I'm going to play golf. Do you need anything? - There's something out there. I just wanna go home. - Carrie, I'm not a monster. ♪ Some times you need to go ♪ ♪ Take a step back ♪ ♪ To see the truth around you ♪ ♪ From distance you can tell ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ Are meant to be ♪ ♪ In the great outdoors. ♪ - Dawn?

Look, I'm sorry, I'm sure he just forgot to tell you, he's at his basketball game, and he wanted me to pick you up. And luckily I'm off work, so here I am. - I don't know. - No, it's okay, you can trust Josh's dad. - Hi, how'd it go? We have to do somethin' about the bills. Your unemployment, it's not coverin' the medical bills. And both the girls, they need new shoes for school. - Can you tell me about your work there? - Yeah, I um, I did... - Please, please say something. What're we gonna do? Your unemployment runs out in a month. - Maybe, maybe you could go back and see Dr. Armstead. You know, maybe get on disability again. Just until we can find somethin'. - You want me to go back on disability for being emotionally unstable? That's what you want me to do? You think I'm crazy. - No, I just think that sometimes you have trouble relating to other people, and so that's why it's kinda hard for you to try and find a-- - You really think I'm crazy. - Mm mm. - Mom, can you come here took my toy. - Mom! - I'm coming. - Look I promise, he really wants to meet you.

See, the hearts and everything? - Well, okay, I guess, but only this once. - Yeah, come on, you crazy kids. Sorry he forgot to tell you. All right, you ready? Buckle up. - The body of the 12 year old girl was found in a pond approximately one half mile off Crown Manor Drive, near route 40 in Reservoir, Virginia. Carrie, wake up, you can save her. Go before it's too late. In the White House today, the president took executive action on the proposed wall being built across the Mexican border. The UN has voted to increase sanctions on North Korea in an effort to force them to stop all nuclear weapons testing... You can save her, go, before it's too late. - Carrie, it's Detective Grant. Give me a call, thanks. - You ready to hit these hot streets-- Oh, look who it is. I don't know, must be training day, or rookie day. Must be rookie day. - Hey man, anyone seen Pete this morning? - You should know, you're a profit, all seeing. Maybe he bailed on you, I know I would. You know Captain's gonna kick you right on out of this department. - What a loser. - And crazy. - Oh yeah, you got that right. - You all right? - He better be glad I'm about to retire. I'd be kicking. - You own this, son. - He better leave. - approximately one half mile off Crown Manor Drive, near route 40 in Reservoir, Virginia. - You'll be all right. - Oh great, there's the other rookie. - What happened? - He got sucker punched by Charles. - Excellent. Charles still around? - Nah, he left a couple minutes ago. - Thanks man. And I know that you're not gonna report that my young, five foot six partner, knocked your grown six foot three tail to the ground, right? Mrs. Richardson? - It's Ms. Rowe. Hold on Jules. Yes? - Detective Parker, may I come in. It's about your daughter. One of your neighbors gave us reason to believe that your daughter may be in trouble. Do you remember the last time you saw her? - Carrie left me a message earlier. I thought she was some kinda nut. - Yeah, well. I mean, when was the last time you saw your daughter? - This morning. I dropped her and her friend Casey off at school. She said she was takin' the late bus home because she had soccer tryouts. - Do you happen to have Casey's home address? If you could call the school and see when soccer practice let's out. Would you like me to do it? Hi this is Detective Parker. Mrs. Richardson I'm... There is no soccer practice today, I'm so sorry. - God, my baby girl. I'm not a bad mother. Just I've been so busy. - Listen, I have to go. If I learn anything new, I'll let you know. - I love my daughter, Detective, please find my little girl. - We will. - I'm really not a bad mother. - I know Mrs. Richardson. Hi, I'm Detective Peter Parker. - Hey, did you know-- - Yeah, Spidey, right? - How can we help you, Detective? - This is about Casey's friend, Dawn. - What about Dawn, has something happened? - If I could talk with you over here. We have reason to believe that Dawn may be in danger. She gave an excuse to her mother that she was staying after school for soccer practice, but there's no soccer practice, I checked. - Casey, do you know anything about this? Casey. - She told me not to tell. Josh, this boy she met online. They exchanged numbers through her social page. They were supposed to meet today after school. Mom, I'm sorry, she told me not to tell. - Oh my god. - Casey, have you seen Josh? - Only a picture. - It's okay, I'm gonna find her. - Casey. - Got her. - Please find Dawn. - It's gonna be all right. - Where's Josh? - Oh, he'll be along in just a minute. - It's getting really late, I, my mom'll be worried, I gotta go home. - Oh no, no no, it's not getting that late. Look, Josh, he really wants to meet you, and he's been tellin' me all about you. You know, you are much prettier in person. - Thank you. Listen, I really need to go home. - I thought you were a big girl. Stop being such a baby. - Please, I wanna go home. - Oh, I know what you're like. You know what you are, you're a tease. I tell my boy about girls like you all the time. You know what a tease is? Dawn. I can't believe she just... Oh, silly little Dawn. Come on Dawn, come out. Dawn. You know, hurt me real bad.
