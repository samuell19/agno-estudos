- It is a mythological catastrophe. - What? But, Mr. Ko?us, I see what I see. A man today, at least like me, can't even rely on the Lord. Excuse me, parson, I meant to say even for the weather. In the morning the sun is beating down and now is such an atheistic disaster. Petras, Petras... The storm always comes from the sky. Well, yes, Mr. Parson, to a man like me I'm walking 10 miles every day, in all weathers, do you know how many miles that is? Catastrophic thoughts. And then the other thougths, like I'm going to Bethlehem. It matters, not exactly the weather, or on the mood, but on of these points of views, as a human being, at least like me, looks at this disaster. Yes. Last night, at midnight, I finished a verse number 1999. Don't you believe? - Tomorrow I begin a new era. - God bless you, Petras. And come over and talk sometime, if you haven't been arrested yet. Parson, to the asylum I'm not profitable enough. But as soon as the Lord wills it and the mushrooms grow, I'll show up as the main contractor. You will make me very happy. Friend! Excuse me, colleague, but there's nowhere to get off. - You voluntarily leave Noah's ark. - Thank you, but that's okay.. There isn't, wasn't and nothing will ever be okay. - I came here to measure the water. - And why here? - Oh, my God. - Wait, Parson, I'll take you. No, thank you, Mr. Kodous. And let's see you at church sometime. - Give me your hand, and you won't slip away. - Goodbye. - You'd be soaking wet. - Thank you. - Oh, so you're Ben? - Greet the Lord. Well, we're home. Excuse me. Sir. They took away my hands, and my feet. - Looking for peace inside? - And where else should I turn? Well, at least you're without inner turmoil. But also without obligations. Thank goodness. Or actually, unfortunately. So there's still something bothering you? Here and now? Absolutely nothing. Despite you let me go through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, if you're with me. Hey. I have to make a phone call. Do you have a phone? I have to call the city. You're going deaf?! ...at least 40 thousand. - One beer, please. - 40, huh? Then he's fucking lying. - So that's the third beer. And give me also a one shot. Personally, I hate barbed wire. I don't go where I'm not supposed to, do I? Mr. Vanous, I'm paying! Yeah, does this belong in a pub? Gentlemen, whether you like it or not, we all belong there. We all belong there? Me certainly not. - Here's my problem. - I'll sort it out. - Here we are, Pepa. - C'mon, lads... - Hey, Grandpa! - Cheers! ... the young men of the fiery furnace, you should rely on a man like me. - You know it. - The truth is always three - Right, left and the one in the middle. - Aha... You're a brother! - Fourth is the best. - Well, that's not true! By the way, gentlemen, does anyone know if I could buy a terrarium? - Okay. - Which is not leaking. Breeding creatures? In every sunnier inland town there's at least one sailor. - May I ask a personal question? - Sure, yeah. I'm always absolutely honest. As a sailor, have you shipwrecked, or discovered something? - I'll take the red one. - I haven't found anyone competent here. - Well, that's normal here. - Here... I had an appointment and... Well, you'll find that fairly easily, but not that easy. Well, with your intelligence... Is that a question or a statement? The question is.. - Water Thanks. Necessity or luxury? I'm a history and music teacher. I mean, I was. So was I. Shame on them, from the wheelwright to the minister. Down the hill, over the bridge, straight on. - You can count on me. - Thanks. - I know a guy here. Hey! - Hey, guys - But I don't say hello to everyone. To whom you don't, for example? Friend, I'd like to be unspecific. - Is it all? - Yes. Local scenery? Sorry. Sorry, my friend. Sursum corda. - I pity anyone who doesn't know what... - I don't even feel sorry for myself. Some may live. I wanted to say, that I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't know, what it means that absolutely beautiful "sursum corda". No, my friend. Let some words remain mysterious. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Water Resources 06, is it here? The resources can be found here. But water? - I found traces of blood there. - Oh, c'mon. - Really. You can find human footprints everywhere today. Even on the moon. "A small step for me, big for humanity." Yeah, Armstrong, eh? I'll lower the volume. As I'm looking at all your papers, I'm under the impression that you're either too early or too late. - Kind of a bad time. - So how? Right or wrong? - Well, now take a look - What for? Come take a look. It's coming now. That... that... - So what? - Wait, wait, wait. We're fine. Wait. And now he's gonna speed up! - I love that, the speed. - I admire the courage. Let's have a drink. Here we go. It's just our human face, but... Just? At least it's enlightened. Well, cheers, so you'll be happy with us. ... the young Englishman Roger Williamson. Terrible. From the whole starting field contributed to help his opponent. David Parley. Yeah, don't count on much comfort, but it pays well here. And what has been granted you can take for granted. Well, and you need to be a little careful. We got snakes here. I can deal with them. Do you mind? Of course. Just serve yourself. Well, I prefer the company of cacti. Oh, yeah, yeah... Area HV 106-107. That's your area. There you go, there is your trailer, see? This is where we're pulling the power from Route 331 here with a cable. And lock that trailer without fail! I'm telling you, lock it, lock it. The key... I'll give you the key. - Then you'll get your boots. - Do you know what's nice about cacti? - They're thorny, but not aggressive. - Look, this is my pride and joy. That's... that's Robertia senilis. That's... Do you know it only needs two drops every second day? Not much. Strange life. No enough to me. - You're following me, right? - Yeah. Come on. Well, here it is, my kingdom. Please, come in. Oh, shit. Pairs of rubber boots, paper flowers... at least they won't fade. Feel free to ask for two pairs, professor. - So how many? - One pair is enough for now. - I meant the size. - Ah, so... as many as I am old. Well, that's 43. Christ's years, huh? Plus ten. You know, he came to that shop and says... C'mon, c'mon... we're waiting for you! - No need to go on foot. - We'll give you a lift. You'll give me a lift? Well, yeah. It's a long way. - You're part of that company, too? - Of course. We all belong to the same company here. Hey, Stop! Stop it! Lydie! You won't be dragging your heels with it. We'll give you a ride. Please. Take this. Thank you, you are very kind. - Wednesday, to the hospital again, huh? - Mhm. I always take too many cakes. And my mother gives nearly all away anyway. Excuse me? I don't know you. Is this your first time here? I don't know... I always get the feeling I was at the place before already. I might have been here before too. Take it. - Thank you. Your husband served half of the sentence already, huh? Why isn't he out yet? Well, he's still locked. It seems he'll... stay behind bars about 3 more years. Hospitals, prisons and sometimes and maternity wards, that's all my life now. I have an inside information. There will be an amnesty. - Poor girl. - Yeah, but still nice. - Pretty damn nice. - She'd be worth the trouble. Go! - No, no, no, no, no way! - It can't be helped. Whoever stays in sight of the fortress can't remain anonymous. - It's for your own good! - It's quite normal here. Well, do you know what? You know what? Just go to fuck yourselves. - So, don't be mad at us! - Thanks for the lift. - Well, we want to help. - Hello... you forgot something! Snakes are all around. I'd love to see those snakes. Oh, no... No... better not. Come here. Come to me. Oh, don't worry. You're a pretty cat. Come on, come on, come on up. more. Clever. Come here! C'mon, come here! Move away, Macek! Macek! So, how are you doing? What about all your measures? Dumbass, you'd get hit. But you shouldn't run barefoot here, Evald. - What would I do without you? - Foolish Evald. Be so kind, Evald, and put on our shoes. You have to come with us for a while. - I don't have to do anything. - You're right, you don't have to. You don't have to. - But you could. - You should. Nice work. You don't see that nowadays. That's a fact. You don't wear socks? - Well, that's none of your business, don't you think? - Well, whatever. Without socks, my feet would sweat profusely in the rubber boots. - Fully agree! - Gentlemen... - I have a certain information for you. - Really? It rained last night. Are you gonna reproach me that I like cats, aren't you? The barbed wire is not for a cat, Ewald. May I? Thank you. The right spelling of my name is Evald. That's right. Why did you leave the school? - Or didn't you leave? - Now, I measure water. We know. But we care about you. About your future. - About your existence. -About the existence of all of us. Leave me out, okay? Captain, explain to him the state of affairs here in front of the witnesses. I'm a subordinate to the higher command of the armed forces. I don't have to explain anything to anyone. The rules related to the fort are clear. - Locked object, entry prohibited. - That's your business. That's what we need to talk about a little bit. Can I leave? - I'm leaving too. - Wait, wait, Evald! - What's this? What's up? - We are not done yet, Evald. Come on, I'd like to buy a pair of socks, my feet sweat terribly. - Take it easy. - Sit down, calm down. That's an area far more important than some bucket of water. To all of us. Here... and there. Be a little more careful. Hey, give me a cigar. Don't stare and give me a cig. - Do you know what's a classic triple combination? - What? - Beer, coffee, rum. - Well, not really a usual request. Hello. Hello. That's okay, Lydia. Thank you. Aren't you afraid of money? When your man is locked for ? 132. - - People are guilty, not money. - You're true gentleman. Lydia, Lydia, listen to what I wrote for you. Tell me It's a shame to ignore...your beauty. Can I? My friend, you can... You can do anything. - Your wish? - Rum, Doubled - A poem. We will be together like a skin to a snake. - I have a stab in my heart. - C'mon, Petrasek! As if you didn't know a snake takes off its skin like underwear. - Yeah... But only once a year. - Let me go, please. - I envy you, Mr. Petraska. - You're welcome. Why? For being crazy? Well, finally! One more doubled. - And something for you too. - I don't know, I don't know. - Under 18 and drunk... - So, what? Where are we? In bar! - In a bar, no reformatory. - You're drunk. Fortunately, I was already 18 and being a driver is also over But what is it to be drunk I do not know. Am I nearly drunk or too drunk? - Adjectives don't get along with paragraphs. - Cheers. Originally a Romanesque fortress. In the Gothic period they started to build a cloister, but they didn't have bucks. - Beautiful, it's beautiful ruin. - Beautiful? Why beautiful? Well, the gothic friezes and rosettes, overgrown with willows and heather. So you lived here already in the thirteenth century? Well of course. A person like me. I'm writing a fortress epic. Yeah. In the Renaissance it was a banquet. An eventful banquet. Jan Old?ich Guldenreich he caught his wife cheating. - And where? - Well, where? In bed! He threw the lover into the well and adulteress into a chest full of vipers. He appears in the former chapel, at midnight. Instead of hair, a viper. Too bad I'm not a painter I see it in vivid colors. What are they watching over there? That's a question!. To guard or not to guard? Or, to drink or not to drink? During the Thirty Years' War, imperial troops buried the treasure there. - The entire national treasury. - You might be right about the wife. Well, good for her, I'd say. But the imperial troops never marched here during the Thirty Years' War. But if I'd be in command, imperial troops would march here. Be sure. Since I'm already one step behind the half of my life, I can boldly say that my epic will be called... plain and simple. Fortress of Vipers. For you! Without the viper. Viper skin is rare. They already know me well. But you, my friend, watch out for them. Evald! Evald! Come here, don't run away. Attention! Better hold on, we're going downhill. - So what? - Well... - To the church or to the brothel? - You'd better go to church. - That's what I call the freedom of choice. - Thanks. Ben! Ben! Come here, Ben! Hop. Oh, you, man, I'm telling you to come to me. - What do they still want from me? - So that we have to think about them. They creep into our souls. What are we going to do with all those mad spiders? Do we let them live? Well, if they're not gone yet, then leave them alone. They're going to make a mess again. And we'll have something to clean up. I would like be up here forever. With pleasure. On the contrary, I'd like to not hold your ladder down here forever. Why is everyone so afraid of snakes here? Who is gonna smear your head, you're gonna rub his heel. A joyless philosophy. Like who of whom. I have to say that I prefer cats to people. If a cat can stay with me, all is not yet lost with me. - And would it also apply to dogs? - No. - Praise be to Jesus Christ. - Forever, Mrs. Mrazkova. - I classify dogs next to people. - What do you mean, Evald? They're addicts, and perhaps that's why they're so docile. We all have a snake inside us. I can recall how angry I was as a kid, whenever I lost this game. I absolutely could not lose. Later, when I played it with my kids, I understood why the game is called "Man, don't be angry". And where are your children? Figure taken! You won't be angry today, huh? No and yes. Sometimes I'm angry with myself. I would see it all absolutely differently. Absolutely how? I've been working all my life something other than what I want. Than what should I do. You know, that's why I'm here, to pray and serve. And me? Just so you believe. But that's probably not what you're looking for, huh? Grip! Full force! Move it! Roll! All right, all right. - Come on! - Come on, come on, come on. Go on! Enough, stop. - Moved exactly 45 degrees. Is that enough? - Absolutely. Thank you. When I have a bed from north to south, I won't fall asleep. I had a sleepwalker on my unit last year. Once in a trance, he ran out down to the wire, idiot We almost shot him. I've been fooling around here for eight years. I haven't been teaching for 16 years, 4 months and 9 days. Do you think I'm here for punishment or reward? Is there anything in between? Just the fucking life. Well no? Like this? Some moves are either incomprehensible... or brilliant. You really don't want to win, do you? Can somebody, gentlemen, explain why he turned... - Do you perceive me? - Yes, of course. Why did he turn the trailer? And another interesting problem. Who was helping him with this. - Yeah, well, he wouldn't have moved it on his own. - And it's exactly 45 degrees. We need to find out a lot more about him. I understand. I mean, first of all, secondly and thirdly. Hi, friend. What are you doing here? Macek! Macek! Come on. You're such a smart cat. Come on. That's strange. Well, well. A man like me would think that everything in the world is still the same. No, it's not. Things are different. Friends, has the world turned or just your saloon car? - Where do you meet them? - Me? Where do I put my foot? I don't understand. Absolutely uninjured. - How do you catch them? - Watch and listen. Your heart is as fragrant as a rose. Ah, the sharpened barbs. You are a fortress on the hills. What is buried is buried again. So. The sea has died, only the wreck remains. Hi! Come to me. Macek!. Macek!. Come here. So what do you say, friend? We are together, huh? Stop it! Let me go! Oh! - What do you think of yourself? - Idiot. - Slut! - Moron! Please, do you have any rags? Don't stare at me, idiot! Are you deaf? Well, that's great. Cool. I'm Alena. As if I'm not here. No formalities! No beer. Water. I hope it's not poisoned. Don't you have a cigar? Do you or don't you? Well, I didn't get laid in the trailer yet. I need to pee. Where is your door? Where is your girl? - Here. - Fuck. - They are all equally hairy. - You're right. More or less. - Is she in your bed? - No. She isn't She isn't, if you say so. I believe you And you know why? Because we are friends. So what? Well, what? What are you thinking about? About you. About everything. About nothing. Damn, your stupid bed is made of raw wood. My stockings are fucked! Lord God, why am I so self-destructive? Do you have anything in common with those guys? - With which ones? - Well, with those I have anything in common. It's not worth mentioning. We all know each other here. Thoroughly. And everyone is afraid of everyone. It's like this. You have beautiful hands. Absolutely perfect. Are you able to love me? Stop it! Enough! It's sickening! Damn life! Fools! I hate you! Damn! Macek! Macek! Macek! - Just come in, Evald. - Come in. We are just checking your files. - You're doing pretty well. - Not so bad. But no, it's perfectly fine. Take a look. The density of the source is determined totally... reliable. You don't lock the trailer? It is a mistake. That's a big mistake. Aren't you afraid at all? Do you? No, I'm on duty. - Does it magnify enough? - Yeah, it's okay. - Can I try it? Serve yourself. What is it? Does it stop magnifying? More precisely, we would say, it stopped zooming in. And even more precisely, gentlemen... go to hell! This binocular belongs to the fortress. Then, where is the binocular that has been entrusted to you by us? So where are you flying to? To heaven or hell? They didn't tell you that they're shooting at the wires here, huh?! Because of a gnawed pencil... - It's driving you crazy, isn't it? - Me or you? Probably both. Even when I'm sleeping, even when I'm sitting on the toilet... still close your towers. All your shooting, searchlights, wires, sirens... Discuss this crap at the parish or at the bar, don't bother me. It drives all of us mad. Take it! Leftovers from lunch. Should it be thrown away or what? So, eat it and I'll come back for you. He's a poor loner. No contacts at all! - Never! - Neither with one, nor the other side? - No. - Since, he got kicked out of school there is not a single friend. No woman I mean, a permanent one. So, how was it? Did he get fired or did he leave on his own? - Well, probably both. - Catholic, but not practicing. - Contacts East: zero. Contacts West: zero. - Here... Besides, the ex-wife and two children. Insignificant, of no value. Alcoholism: Yes. But he was not even treated on an outpatient basis. Jewish great-grandmother, German grandpa. Particularly important! No apartment, no permanent residence. Well, from us he got at least the wellies and clean bedclothes. We give the opportunity to everyone! If one wants to. Of course. And he is carrying out the water measurements really reliably. But all your water measurements are least important! Above-average chess player, who just plays harmonica. And the organ. - Ben! You will be here with us. Come on. Ben! Ben, come here! "Where there are two or three I'm in the middle there." Good dog, good! You know that. You're a bit nervous today, Evald. I am! I think it's because I don't know what to await. Four. Really four! I expect your lucky number, right? I wish you would once shave. Don't you think? I could. But why? - Aren't you preparing a tie for me, are you? - No, but... a little surprise. - Turn to me. - Wait. - Oh, no! - Well, yes. Wait Do you like it? -And now we're going somewhere. - But where? Cheers to those who crawl! Well, I... I would... I'd rather fly, my friend. Let all sizzle in alcohol. Do you know why they didn't let me go up in the air? Because I have flat feet. Do you get it? Flat feet! I'm done. C'mon. I quit! Is the water dry or wet? Shit! Death came upon me! It's a monster... cold like ice. How is it going? - It works, but it sucks. - We absolutely thoroughly devastated ourselves. We again destroyed a living material force of our common enemy. Clearly and definitively. Take it! - A beer would do the trick. - Yeah. It would truly do the trick, but first we have to find your pants. - Stop! Password! - "Nest of vipers." You know, the rule has to be followed. - Password! - "Nest of vipers." Well. Go ahead. C'mon! Flat feet. Flat stairs. - Now, you will see the naked truth of life. - What's this nonsense? Well, I heard this from one fucking bitch. When I first saw her undressed. I was thirteen. I'm the only one who knows what's being watched here. Since you're a friend, I'm taking you here. Come on. And because you're my only friend I'll let you choose. And what? Do you want to see it or not? Well, since I'm here... You asked for it, my friend. Wait. Wait. You're guarding a total shit here. Shit! Shit! Shit! - If only that! - Shit. Shit! - Shit... - Shit! Shit. Shit. Shit... You're not going to pick on us. Bastard! Take care of him, old codger! I don't know anything. But I know. The old woman bought a goose. We ate half of it today and the other is being sparred for Sunday. Damn. My friend, take it easy. take it easy! Mr. Petrasek, I wouldn't expect such a stupid phrase from you. But... what if...after all.. there... eventually... they guard something? Moment! - So, to think it over, I'll put down... - Yeah, my friend, you're wasted. That's the most horrible crime...to be sober... breaking through the darkness. Friend, my friend... May I ask a question? That chair... do you consider it... to be...a throne? Or... rather... a toilet bowl? Macek! Macek! Like this? Or like this? C'mon, that's probably not necessary. But if it bothers you, what about something like this? But in that case, we would made everything terribly complicated. And you wouldn't want that, would you? We are sorry to bother you so much. Don't worry, it's just a formality. We're a bit late. It's a pity. They certainly can't wait for you. Go in! - Absolutely out of the question! - We are not done yet, Evald! Sit down. Where do you get the gall? Am I supposed to confirm I'm blind? I ask the questions here. You are guarding a completely empty tiled room. After all, if you wouldn't spread fear, you'd loose the power. Do you want to end up in a madhouse? You'll definitely follow me there too. So... I brought you rubber boots... new... green. - Serve yourself. - Thank you. So sign it it's just one sentence. - Can I take some? - Of course. Did we give him a chance? We did. Should I take it as an order? We don't give orders. We just say what is needed. Give me a cigar! Ben! Ben! C'mon, Ben! No, no, just a sniff, you know? You wouldn't take that. Make him sign it. Worse things have been signed, don't you think? Why would I give advice to anyone? Well, make him at least to leave this place. Now, without delay. And very far away. Clear? Macek! Macek! Macek! Macek... Macek! See, Evald... I'm looking at the crucified man every day. But that's Lord Himself. Here's the salt if you want it. But that...that one can crucify an animal... actually... a little creature... That's what I mean. - Defenselessness irritates me. - No, no, defenselessness makes sense. A big one! When... it brings sacrifice. But just for nothing, without reason?! A little more wine, parson? No, no, Evald, please, dilute it with water for me. I have seen under the sun, in the place of judgment, ungodliness, in the place of righteousness, iniquity. I saw everything, during the days of my nothingness, the wise, who, though righteous, perish, the evil, though wicked, lives long. Dissection proved it was caused by snakes. During the autopsy, they found four bites. Four? Do you know what I would like to know? If one snake bites four times, or if it has to be four snakes. And I said to myself, the good and the evil alike will be judged by God. And then all get rewarded. Amen. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Subtitles by Shrekcore KG
