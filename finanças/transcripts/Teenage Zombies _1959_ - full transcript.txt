(dramatic music) (1950s rock music) - Chocolate and strawberry. You want anything, Morrie? - No, Dotty's waiting for me. I gotta leave in a couple of minutes. - Two malts, 50 cents. - Here's your chance,Kelly, double or nothing. - How do I know you've got the other half? - Kelly, sometimes I don't thinkyou're ever gonna get rich. - Sometimes I worry about that myself. - Hey, Regg, how aboutyou and the other guys going horseback riding with me and Dot? - We can't do it. I've been working all week on my boat and it's running real good andwe're gonna go water skiing. - Oh, you guys, what a drag. All you ever do is water ski. - Do you wanna come along? - No, I promised Dotty. Anyway, she's waitingfor me at the stable. - I'll tell you what. You go riding, we're go water skiing and I'll pick you up atfour o'clock at the stable. Then we'll figure outsomething for the night. - You'll pick us up for sure? - You know I wouldn't hang you up. - Well, okay. I'll tell Dot and I'll meet you at four. - Tell her I said to keep an eye on you. - Oh. - And check the stirrups. A big wind might come up. - Very funny. - Hi, half-pint, where you going? - I'll never tell. - What's the matter with him? - He's been eating too much hay. He doesn't want to go water skiing. - Wow, I mean, how weird can you get, huh? - Are you ready? - Yeah, all set. Pam's making a lunch. Hey, and guess wherewe're going to eat it. - In the boat? - Nope, on an island. - An island. - Yeah, it's a real gas. Some guys told me about it. - I've been all over that water, and I've never seen any island. - You never went that far out. It's way out, where the water's too rough to go skiing. - Sounds crazy, Regg. - Are you going to believe this scam? He's always coming up with some long shot. This time it's an island. - All right, I'll tell you what I'll do. If that island isn't there, I'll buy two new carburetors for your boat and I'll put them both in myself. - Come on, Regg, let's find out. - All right. (waves lapping) - I told you this island was here. Nobody ever believes me. - Funny we never knew about it. - We do now, and it'll make a crazyspot for beach parties. - Let's take a look around. - Yeah, let's. (relaxed music) Hey, dig that. (eerie music) (ominous music) (birds chirping) - Reggie, look. (dramatic music) - They way they walk. What's the matter with them? - Doped, or dead, or something. (dramatic music) - She's seen us. - Let's get out of here. (dramatic music) - The boat's gone! - Well, they couldn't have taken it far. - Who couldn't have? - The people on this island. - Maybe it floated out. - No, I tied it real good. - Well, let's not get panicky. It has to be somewhere on the shore, so let's circle around and (whispering). (waves lapping) (tense music) This sure beats me. No landing dock or anything. They might have tied itup at a better place. We'd better go see. - Not me. Julie and I will wait for you here. (dramatic music) (knocking on door) (knocking harder) - Well, the kids who ran off. How do you do? - Good afternoon, ma'am. We're uh, we're looking for a boat. - A boat? - I tied it up down at the beach about an hour ago, and now it's gone. - Won't you come in? I'll get you a soft drink. - Oh thanks ma'am, but we just, oh yeah, a soft drink, that'll be fine. (curious music) - Now, tell me about your boat. - Have you got it? - Your boat? Of course not, I've been here all day. - Well, someone took it. And if we're not supposed tobe here, well, we're sorry. I mean, if you'll justgive us our boat back, we won't come back anymore. - But I told you, Ihaven't taken your boat. - What sort of place is this? I mean, who's in charge here? Someone knows where our boat is. - I'm afraid I'm theonly one you can talk to. - We've walked all around this island. Now where do you keep your boats? - We have no boats here. - But how do you get backand forth to shore, walk? - You're certainly aninquisitive young man. We have no use for boats here, because no one leaves the island. - Hey Regg, you rememberthat boat we saw last month without any skiers? - Yeah, they must have been headed here. - Whoever you saw, I'msure was going elsewhere. - Look, we don't care whocomes here and who doesn't. But I think you know whereour boat is, and we want it. - I'm sorry, I can't help you. - Okay, if that's the way you want it, we're gonna go see the sheriff. - Yeah. - You certainly have a lot of courage. You're very flattering. (girls screaming) - Hey, that sounds like Julie and Pam. - What are the girls doing here? Where are they? - I'll find out for you. Ivan. Ivan, are the two girls there? (dramatic music) That's fine, Ivan, we'llbe down to see them. Your friends are downstairs. Come with me. (ominous music) - Pam, Julia! What's going on?- What's going on? Come on now, hey, come on! - You'll have to excuse Ivan's manners. He's very strong, andsometimes forgets himself. If you behave yourselves,he'll not hurt you. - Hey, wh, what are yougoing to do with us? - I'll first answer your other question. We've taken care of your boat, and none of you will leave here. Instead, you will help mein some very important work. No one asked you here,but your curious nature will in turn aid me very much. - Look, what kind ofa creep joint is this? - A place of research and discovery, a place where science is free from the interference of stupid politicians. - Oh yeah? Well you won't get away with it. We've got some friends waiting for us. When we don't show up, they're going to follow us out here looking for us, and they're going to bustup this whole weird place. - Please let us go. We'll promise never totell anyone about it. - I'm afraid that's impossible. And as far as someonediscovering this island, well that doesn't bother me in the least. You must excuse me now, I have work to do. Remember what I said. Behave yourselves, and you won't get hurt. Come, Ivan. (girls crying) - Hi, Kelly. - Hiya kid, what you doing? - I'm looking for Regg, you seen him? - No, not since youwere here this morning. - How about Skip or Julie? - No, they all left togetherright after you did. - They were supposedto pick Dotty and me up two hours ago at the stables. - Well, they went outin a boat, didn't they? - Yeah. - Do you think they mighthave had an accident? - I don't know. When they didn't show up at the stables, I thought maybe Regg might have forgot. But since they haven't been here either, I don't know what to think. - Maybe they ran out of gas. - Well, if they'd ran out of gas, they could have paddled in. It wouldn't have taken them this long. - Where's Dotty? - Oh, she's still waitingdown at the stables. - You know, Morrie, I'venever been out there, but I understand those waterscan be treacherous at times. I think the wisest thing for you to do is go see the sheriff. He'll know what to do. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - I'll get Tommy to drive you out. Better stop by to pick up Dotty first. - Yeah. (anxious music) - Can I help you? - I hope so. I'm, I'm Morrie Timms. I, I live over in Compton County. So does Dotty. - What can I do for you, Morrie? - Well, we were water skiing today. No I, I mean we didn't go water skiing, we went horseback riding but, well, Regg and the other kids-- - Oh, let me tell him, Morrie. - That sounds like a good idea. - Well, the kids we runaround with, four of them, they went water skiing,and they were supposed to pick us up at four o'clock. - At the stables, where we were riding. - But they didn't come. Not at four or five or six. - What kind of a boat did they have? - Well it's, well it's got a homemade hull and a souped up V-8 engine. - Was it likely to break down? - No, no, I don't think so, you see Regg, well he keeps it in tip-topcondition all the time. - Well, I think you'd bettertalk to the sheriff about this. - All right, let's hear all about it. - Well, we were afraid theboat tipped over or something because they were supposed topick us up a long time ago. - You know what direction they went? - No, they just went waterskiing, no special direction. - Well now, we have about 800 square miles of water out there. It'll be difficult for usto search an area like that. - But you've gotta dosomething, you just got to. - Now, now, don't misunderstand me. We'll do the very best we can, of course. You tell Riggin to pickup searching immediately. You and I'll relieve himat five in the morning. - Can we go with them? - I'm afraid not, miss,it's practically dark. - You kids have a car? - Well, no, not one of my own. - Then I'll drive you two home. - Oh, thanks, but could youdrive me down to Reggie's car? I'd like to drive it. Reggie doesn't like to leave it outside. - All right. - Any luck, Sheriff? - I'm sorry son, nothing yet. - I wish there was somethingwe could do to help. Hey, let's take one ofWally's boats and look around. Wally won't mind. (eerie music) You know, as we were pulling up, I could have sworn I saw somebody walking. - You mustn't get carried away. If they were here, we'd have seen a boat. - Look! I told you I saw somebody, come on. (dramatic music) - Come in. (tense music) Are you looking for someone? - Uh, we saw a man back there,we were trying to find him. - He's gone now. Can I help you? - Well I, I guess you can. We were going to ask him if, if he saw anybody, four kids, in a boat around here yesterday. - Well, I'm sure he didn't. Neither did I. You see, we were bothinside all day yesterday. - Do you live here? - Of course. Would you like to take a rest? - Uh, no, I uh, we, we'd better get going. You see, we're searching the water for our friends. We think they might have drowned. - Why, that's terrible. I hope you find them safe and well. Are you sure you wouldn't like a sandwich or something before you go? - Um, no, I, I think not. Thanks anyway. I'll bet you don't getmany visitors out here. - No one ever comes here. - Oh. Well, goodbye. Thanks for the information. (dramatic music) (tense music) - Who were those snooperswe saw by the water? - Just some kids lookingfor their friends. - I don't like people around here. There's too much at stake. - You know people are of no concern. Besides, I'm the one whohas to stay here, not you. - A slip up now will ruin everything. - You don't have to worry. I know exactly what I'm doing. - That's what we're here to find out. How is the work progressing. - Very well. I hope to complete phase three this week. - Phase three? You were on that thelast time we were here. - And now it's nearly completed. What do you expect in four months? - We expect results. We must have results and soon. - Tell me, doctor, what's the chance of finishing the researchwithin six weeks? - You mean the research,or the actually completion of a perfect capsule? - I mean the completion of5,000 capsules ready to drop. - I've received orders from the east. Now we must move in another direction unless your capsules are ready in time. - You mean, hydrogen bombs? - Yes. - Fools, the stupid fools. What good is land that you can't use or go near for years? - You know of course that wedon't control these things. - Well, what about it? Can you speed up the work? - It is possible, but I've run into a factorthat may give us trouble. Come and see for yourself. (dramatic music) (liquid bubbling) This is the first capsulethat was used on subject one. It proved much too strong, as the subject died in five hours. I worked out this highlyconcentrated buffer, and tested it on four separate subjects. - And the results? - About zero consistency. Have a look. If you'll notice, thesubjects are direct opposites. One has no spark nor desire for anything. The other teems with rage. - What about that fellowwe saw last month? His reaction was perfect. - Ivan, the perfect slave. Desire to work, perfect health,and obeys every command. With half the people onearth in his condition, we'd have the epitome of civilization. - In the bombing of the United States, how many would turn out like him? - Not enough to takecare of the wild ones. You couldn't possible dropthe pellets as they now exist. - Then you must find out what it is about Ivan that produced the effect. - I've performed everypractical test on him. His body chemistry isbasically the same as the rest. - Well, you'll have to figure it out. - I don't believe it canbe done in short time. But there is an alternative. - [Man] What's that? - It might prove dangerous, but if time is of the essence. I worked out a formula using a completely different paralyzing agent. It rushes directly to the nervous system, and can be dropped as a gas, and also it will be difficult to detect in the American water system. - Is it dangerous to us? - Not in the way you would imagine. The problem is, it can be counteracted. - You mean it's not lasting. - Effective and lasting, until someone discovers what would bring the subjects back to normal. - Can't you do something or strengthen it? - You want the people alive and strong so they can work and obey their superiors. If I increase the gas, they'd mostly die. - But if they cannot think for themselves, how can they possibly reason acounteragent would help them? - That's what we would have to gamble, at least until we have timeto develop a second gas. - How effective is it? - I'll give you a demonstration. Ivan, I'm preparing a test. Be ready to stand by. You'll now be able to see the effects taken by a near human subject. I think you'll agree this onehas plenty of fight in him. (machinery whirring) (dramatic music) Now we tame the savage beast. Ivan. Come and get him. You can take him to one of the old cages. - It's amazing. In a matter of seconds, histemper completely suppressed. - I won't even have tolock him up any more. Although, unlike a man, he's not useful. After I run some tests,Ivan will destroy him. (dramatic music) - He appears to have noconscious feeling at all. - From now on, he'll moveexactly as he's directed. - If only this could be permanent. - If only we hadn't beenbetrayed, we'd have the time. - What are you talkingabout, who betrayed us? - Do you remember Filos, ourcontact in South America, the one that helped you with the passport? - Very well. I last saw him in Buenos Aires. - The reason that passport looked so good was because it was a legitimate one. We recently found out that he was a United States federal agent. - Where is he now? - Dead. But we don't know whetheror not he had enough time to contact his officeabout this operation. - This is the reason forthe change in time element. - If he did talk to the Pentagon, they'd soon find this place. - Then it's up to you. If you want to take achance with what you saw, then I'll hurry alongwith the final tests. I have four human subjects to use. - Four new ones? - The friends of thosekids you saw outside. - Are you sure they won't be back? - I rather doubt it, but ifthey do, we can handle them. - We'd better stay herea few days, just in case. - [Receptionist] Major Coleman is here. - Would you send him right in, please. Did you bring everything they found? - The suitcase contained mostly clothing and personal belongings. I have all the papers we located, but I'm afraid they don't help much. He couldn't carry anythingof importance with him. - Is there any chance of finding the body? - If we do, it probablywon't tell us much. The murderers undoubtedlychecked his clothing. - Everything addressed to Filos. Is that the only name he used? - He used the name Filosin Argentina and Mexico. Even the police in Buenos Aires were unaware of his identity. - We have other agents in Buenos Aires. Why didn't he contact them? - Colonel, we felt this assignment was the most critical we've ever been on. We tried to avoid anypossible channel of detection, even our own agents. - Your caution certainlydidn't seem to pay off. - Well, I suppose you're right. But we do have one thing, a photograph. This might lead us to their headquarters. First, we're sending copies of this photo to every law enforcementagency in the country. Every city, county, and state officer will be on the lookout for her. Second, we'll detach troopsfrom bases in this area and cover the entire state. When we've finished there,we'll move to another until we've covered the western states, then move eastward. - I'll contact General Mundy for additional helicopters in that area. - With your permission, sir, I'd like to also request Marine and Navy helicopters, and every reconnaissance planethe Air Force has available. - That's a big order. I hope we can fill it. - It must be filled. Do you realize Colonel thatif we don't find their base and stop them now, beforethey distribute this gas in rivers and watersupplies across the nation, we'll be able to save at best 20 percent of the population when they strike. - That's it, clean as a whistle. - Come on. (tense music) - Can you get it all right? - Oh no, this one's going to be harder than the otherone, it's a better lock. - Maybe we can help it. - Shh! Hurry, hurry, he's coming. - Get back against the wall, quick. (dramatic music) Hey you. - Every time he comes here, I'm afraid he's going to open the door. The way he looks at me. - I don't think he can do athing unless he's told to. He must be under some powerful drug. - Maybe he can't hear us when we talk. - Oh, he can hear us alright. Look, it's a good thing hedidn't notice the broken lock. - He probably won't be back for a while. You'll have time to open ours. - No, I think we betterwait until the last minute. Well, if he notices thebroken lock, we'll be cooked. - But now you've got the time. - Look, Julie, getting out ofhere is not a piece of cake. This isn't even half the battle. If we can get throughthat hall and outside, we've got a chance. But we've still gotta get off this island, and we can't swim. - Hey look, look, Regg andI can sneak out of here tonight after it getsdark, and we can go down by the water and look for the boat, huh? - If you find it, we'llstill be locked up here. And what happens if you don't find it? - It's gotta be around here somewhere. And if there's anyone out there, Skip and I alone will have a better chance of not being seen. Now we'll be back before morning,with the boat all set up. Then we make a run for it,hop in the boat and take off. - Sounds fine. Except if anything goes wrong,we're still locked in here. Can't you fix this lock before you go? - I don't think we'll beas lucky with that one. We'll probably have tobreak it into pieces. If he comes back here tonight,he'll notice it for sure. - Hey look, look, wheneverything's all ready, a little noise won't matter then. A couple of good whacks and where all set. - Regg, be careful out there. If they see you, they'll probably-- - Julie, forget it. We'll be back before daylight. And if they should catch us, we can't be any worse offthan we are right now. It's probably dark by now. Come on. (tense music) Skip, come on. (tense music) - The sun's nearly up. - Yeah. - I sort of hate to face the girls. - If I were a channel swimmer, I could make it in about 10 hours. - If we hadn't walked around so much, we could have built a raft. Wait a minute, we couldstill get a good start on it. - You know Skip, sometimesyou really amaze me. Come on. (dramatic music) - Did you find it? Can we get out of here? - Well, it's almostdaylight, we'll have to wait. - But you found the boat? - No. But it's okay, we're building a raft. - A raft! - It's our only chance. We'll have it finished tomorrow night, then we take off. - Hey, we'd better get inside,they might be getting up. - Right. And we'd better get some sleep. - Where's the raft now? - Oh, come on, Regg isright, let's get some rest. - We hid it down by the water. Just keep your fingers crossedthat they don't find it. - Hello, the sheriff please. That's right, the sheriff'soffice, thank you. (phone rings) - Sheriff's Office, Johnson. - Hello, hello, this is Morrie Timms. Yeah, Morrie. Listen, we were out in the boat today, and we came across something real strange. We found this island, wethink the kids might be there. - I see. Look Morrie, I'm due to goout on a call right now. The sheriff isn't here, so you'd better go see him in his home. His address is 233 Elmwood Road. Can you find it? - Well, yeah, I guess so. We're not too far from there. I'll leave right now and catch him. Thanks a lot, goodbye. (dramatic music) - Well, hello kids, come on in. - Sorry to have to botheryou at home, Sheriff. - Oh, that's all right, but westill haven't found anything. - I think we did. Not a boat or anything,but we found something that sure looks funny. - Oh, what'd you see? - Well, we were out there on the water, in this boat we borrowed. So we were looking all around, like you. Well, we go way over toward the east, must have gone about oh, 30, 40 miles. We came to this real weird place. - It was an island. - Yeah, real strange like. I didn't even know it was there before. - Well, that must be Mullet Island. There used to be some buildingson it, about 50 years ago. - That sounds like it. Well, anyway, we feltit was worth looking at, so we went there and wetalked to this woman, and-- - You talked to someone on Mullet Island. - Yeah, she lives there. - I can't believe anyone couldbe living on that old island. There's no facilities. - She lives there all right, we saw her. - How odd. Wonder why anyone would pick that place? Well, what'd she say, had she seen anythingof the boat or the kids? - She said she hadn't seen anybody, but we think she was lying. - Now what makes you think that? - Well, we didn't think toomuch about it at the time. We wanted to look aroundthe water some more. But Dotty brought it up on the way back. - I'm sure she lied to us, Sheriff. She might know something aboutthe kids she's not telling. - Now wait a minute. If people want to live in isolation, that's their own business,they have that right. Don't you jump to conclusions just because this woman may havelooked, well, a little odd. - It's not that, it's, well, she-- - Now look here, you'reall upset about this thing, and it's a terrible experience. But do you really think that a person, well anyone, would see your friends and then deliberately say they hadn't? What possible reason could they have? - We don't know, that'swhy we came to you. - I think you both let yourimaginations run away with you. Now I suggest you go homeand let me handle the search. But I have to tell you the truth, I'm not too optimistic about it after all the area we've covered. - Have you been out to the island? - Now, do you actually believe that your friends would goout there and stay this long? - Well, no, not unlessthey couldn't get off. - She lied to us, I know she did. - She told us no one ever came out there, and as we left a boat was just arriving. - Have you kids home, dinner, or anyplace since coming back from out there? - No, we didn't want to wasteany time looking for you. - All right. If we get in the boat now, ride out there, and have a look around, will that give you any satisfaction? - Yeah, but, well, if we find anything, are you sure you canhandle it by yourself? - I think so, Morrie. And if not, I've got a radio in the boat. (liquid bubbling) - It'll take a fewminutes for the solution to drop to the right temperaturebefore I can combine it. - Won't there be a temperature problem in the water supplies? - Not after I once set the exact formula. The molecules will spread rapidly and actually become a part of the water. - And you say it'll only take a few hours to reach the full effect? - Between one and three hours, the bacteria should be everywhere. - By that, you meanincluding the nerve gas. - The pellets can be of anysize you think necessary. Large ones will of course spread more gas rapidly in the essential areas. - I just hope the effectsare as good as we anticipate. - You won't be disappointed. I'm about ready for the test. If you will excuse me a second. Ivan, we're ready for the two girls. Would you bring them in, please. (intercom buzzes twice) (dramatic music) - [Skip] Go on, get out. Go on. Hey, keep away from them. Come and, come and get me. Come on, get away from them. - Hold it, just hold it. - Come on! - Skip, Skip! Skip, don't let him, don't let him do it! - Now is the time. (girls screaming) (dramatic music) (girls screaming) (tense dramatic music) - They put them in that room to kill them. - Well, we can't rushthem, they must have guns. - If we'd have only gottenout of here last night. (dramatic music) - Now gentlemen, ifyou'll watch carefully, you'll see the exact effectworking on the human system. Well look who we have here. How are you, Mister Sheriff? - Not so good, I've got a couple of real inquisitive kids here. - I knew they'd be trouble. - They won't be any trouble. I think they'll help us instead. - What's going on here, Sheriff? Who are these people? - Morrie, look! It's Julie and Pam! - You see? You see? She did lie, the kids are prisoners here. - Not prisoners. We prefer to call all of you our guests. Ivan. - Sheriff, do something. Sheriff! Ow, tell him to let us go. - It will do you no good,the sheriff won't help you. - I'd like to talk to you, doctor. - Well certain, Sheriff, what is it? - Look, our deal was that I supply you with drunks and prisoners, but this time you've gone too far! - These subjects are no different from the ones you brought me. - Except that they havefamilies that want to find them. The search is gettingpublicity on the outside, and I can't control it. - We can't stop now, not for anything. You have to give us a little more time. - We'll have to move fast, but we'll need somepieces of pipe or clubs. - I'll see what I can find. (dramatic music) - I agree with you (indistinct). - I think we can all relax, keep our wits about this thing. After all, we haven't been discovered yet, and I don't believe there willbe any more people over here. - What do you think, doctor? - I was never one to complainover a simple problem. - Simple problem, do you realize-- - I do realize, and Ialso understand thoroughly what we're all expected to do. I'm doing my job under thesame conditions as you, only I don't complain aboutevery problem I run into. - Very well then, perhapsyou should appoint someone to take my place. - Perhaps we will. - All right, do what you think best. Let me know what you decide. - We certainly will. (gun fires) The fool. Didn't he know that none can quit? - We have to hurry now. Ivan, take him outside. - Where do you want these two? - Keep them there. They'll serve as the second test. - Look, we've got to movenow, or it's too late. Go to the door and let the girls out. - What's that? (tense music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - All right, on your feet! Come on! - Hurry Regg, let's get the girls out. - We can't open that door. But she can. Come on. Come on. All right, go open that door right now. - You keep them covered, Morrie. - [Morrie] Right. (buzzing) (dramatic music) - Their minds are gone,just like the rest. - Yeah, well she knowshow to bring them around, and she's going to do it. All right, get started. - Started with what? - You know what I mean,something to take care of Julie and Pam. - There's nothing I can do for them. - If you'd rather feel a fewbullets burn through you. - Go ahead and kill me if you like, if that will help them. - Look, you invented this stuff, it figures you can do something about it. - If I could, I wouldn't,so you're wasting your time. - Your time's gonna burn outif you don't do what I say. - Hey, hey listen Regg, whenthat gas is poured on someone, they lose their will, don't they? - Yeah. - After that, they do as they're told. - Yeah, I see what you mean. Okay, which way do you want it? All right then, get moving. - Tell them, they'll go through it. - Quiet, you fool. - How do you release the stuff? - Hey, I think this is it right here. (dramatic music) (machinery whirring) I wonder how long it takes. - It looks like it's clearing up. - Let's get her. - Get back! Don't you try that again. - All right now, now let's have it. Come on, now you know what we want. Come on. Something that'll fix the girls. Come on now, I'm not kidding! - Hold it. - You understand me? I mean it! - We're doing something wrong. You two guys come over here. All right, if you guys want to stay alive, you better do as we say. - We can do nothing. - Tell me how to get through to her. - I don't know, we're not scientists. - You know all about this gas, though. - Hey, maybe she's an exception. What do you say we putone of them in there, huh? We'll get them to talk. - Yeah, I'll buy that. Okay, you. Let's go. I said move. - No, wait. I'll tell you. I don't know exactly which one it is, but, if I-- - Show us where it is. - I think that's the one. - What do you mean, youthink that's the one? - She, she only mentioned it once.

I guess they must have been the ones. - Poor devils, I hope wecan do something for them. - I'm Major Coleman. Are you Johnson? - I was placed in temporarycharge of the substation. - From what I understand,the job will be permanent. And these must be thekids that cracked a ring the Army couldn't even locate. - They sure did, sir, andwe're mighty proud of them. - Well, if we did anything sir,it was to save our own neck. Most of us were scaredstiff most of the time. - Nonetheless, you accomplished it, and you performed a great service. This group was the largest menace to United States security we've ever had. - Wow. Hey, you think maybewe'll get a medal, huh? - Oh, there you go. I swear, Skip, you remindme of a walking comic book. - What's wrong with being famous? I can just see the headlines.

Can we go with you whenyou go to search for it? I've got something at stake, you know. My boat's there, andI've got to get it back. - Son, I am sure youare perfectly welcome.
