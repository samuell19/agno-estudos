Hey, Sally. This is taking longer than I thought. Can you jump on my schedule a bit more? I'm working my way through the congresswoman's Christmas list, and I'm still two cashmere sweaters and a Tiffany bracelet away from the bottom. I'm feeling less like a legislative aide and more and more a personal shopper. It's a compliment, Erica. The congresswoman takes her Christmas shopping very seriously. That's why she only trusts it to you. That's a positive spin. Oh, I found that article you wanted. What's a Christmas Drop? It's some sort of mission out of an airbase in the Pacific where they parachute gifts and supplies to remote islands at Christmas. I am sending you a photo of the headline page now. So who's Major Eye Candy in the Santa cap? I have no idea. But ever since the congresswoman became head of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission… …this base has been at the top of her naughty list. Again? Sorry, I lost you. Indiana, are you guys there? Yeah. No, the Wi-Fi's buffering again. Haskell, I thought we agreed to upgrade our bandwidth. We did. But since you had me put the router in the barn so you could FaceTime the vet, the signal's too weak. Let's just reboot the modem. No! Then we'll lose Andrew. No! Haskell! And so ends our family's attempt at Christmas caroling via web. Ah, that's okay, sis. Watching Mom and Dad bicker about Wi-Fi reminds me of Christmas more than you know. How's your Christmas over there, Uncle Andrew? Well, you heard of a partridge in a pear tree? I got a seagull in a coconut palm. Maybe you could borrow an Air Force jet and fly home. It's only eight days till Christmas. I wish I could, kiddo, but they need me here. We got a big job helping Santa out. I know. Mom told me. I just wish you were here for Christmas. Me, too, pumpkin. Me, too. Man, I really miss home this time of year. Look, man, I'm telling you, nothing beats Christmas in Wisconsin. Ice skating, ice fishing, snowmobiling through the trees. Winter there is the best season there is. Yeah, Wisconsin's got all the seasons, all right. It's got winter, still winter, more winter, mud, and then winter again. Repeatin' the same joke each day - doesn't make it any funnier, eh, Joker? - Hah! Look, I just thought adding in the extra "winter" - would give it more life, you know? - 'Cause it had life? The joke is Wisconsin's got nothing on Arizona. And, man, do I miss my momma's eggnog pumpkin pie. What about you, Sunshine? Miss anything? Anyone? I really miss Cam. My '67 Camaro. In my garage, gatherin' dust. Well, we all wanna be home this time of year, but, uh, we got the next best thing. Need your signature, Captain. Are you gonna be on base for Christmas, Airman? Afraid so, sir. Well, we got the Drop coming up. The typhoon last month ripped the roof off of our warehouse, and we lost most of our donations, so we're still playing catch-up. - We could use as much help as we can get. - I'm signed up. Well done. We got a fundraiser coming up this weekend. It's gonna be lots of good music, good people, holiday cheer. And dancing. Lots and lots of dancing. I'm a world-class dancer, Sunshine. You know, there might be enough room for me to show you all my moves. Not gonna happen. Yeah, you wouldn't wanna miss Joker's world-class dancing. It's for the best cause, so… Yeah, that's just one part of the captain's personal mission to make sure that nobody in this base misses the holiday season. If we can't be home for Christmas… We're gonna bring Christmas here. Come on, Sam. The committee meeting ended at three a.m., okay? The congresswoman was tired and misspoke. How about you quote someone else for your article, and maybe I can find an invite for you for the French embassy's New Year's party? Yes. With a plus one. Great. You're magic. I think this legislative-aide thing may put your personal shopping career on the back burner. And that's why you're a shoo-in to be the next chief of staff. Last I checked, we already have one. Not for long. I hear that lobbying group just upped Sheila's offer. - Seriously? - Mm-hm. …cowboys, cowboys… No. There's… …others way ahead of me in line for that, like Matt. How do I compete with a guy that can pull off a holiday tie and a matching pocket square? Bradford's Bat-Signal. - It's all emojis. She's in trouble. - Mm. I got this. Well, it's… it's quite a lot of detail to take in. Excuse me, congresswoman. You're wanted on an urgent matter. - National security. - Mm. - Excuse us. - Mm. Ah, that was perfect timing. Remind me not to have discussions with snow sculpture enthusiasts again. I'll add it to the list, ma'am. Okay. You have 40 minutes before your meeting with General Mason about the closure proposals. - That's today? - Mm-hm. Where are you with the research on that air base in the Pacific? Andersen is the base. I'm pulling together some info. "Operation Christmas Drop." They've been using our military cargo planes to drop gifts and supplies to remote islands at Christmas. If we're looking to close down bases, this one's flashing red and green. They're calling it a low altitude training exercise. That just happens to be dropping Christmas presents. Yes, but I'm sure there's more to it than that. Well, then, find out. I'm gonna send you over there. You can assess their operations, suggest cuts, or, better yet, make a case for base closure. You're sending me? I need your investigative prowess to turn over every stone on that island. You know, January in the tropics doesn't sound so bad. Says here this Drop thing is in a week. You need to be there before it happens. Boots on the ground, Miller. Kind of had plans for Christmas. Hey, Dad. I guess, by the look on your face, you got my message. Honey, what assignment is so important you have to cancel Christmas with your family this time? Look, I know you're disappointed, but I can't get out of it. Carol and I were really looking forward to seeing you this year. I know, Dad. But it's a chief of staff job opening, and this might be a real game-changer for me. Are you sure that's really the reason, sweetheart? What else would it be? You haven't been here for Christmas since your mom passed away, Eri. If you could just give Carol a chance, I think you two could be friends. It's not Carol, Dad. Look, maybe there's a way that I can… Come for your birthday, maybe. Another "maybe." Well, that's the best I got, Dad. Be safe. I love you. Okay. I love you. I know, Mom. I'm trying. - Permission to enter, sir? - Enter. At ease, Andrew. - You asked to see me, sir? - I did. I got off the phone with the head of the Armed Services Committee this morning. Word is, we're on the short list for realignment or closure. Seriously, sir? They make a final decision in a few weeks, but a friend on the Hill got a message to me saying we've got a target on our backs. But, sir, we're the most strategically important location in the South Pacific. Maybe, but this didn't help. For some reason, this has grabbed Washington's attention, and now we're in their crosshairs. - And I need you to get us out of it. - Me, sir? There's a congressional aide flying in from DC to evaluate base operations. I need someone to show 'em around, put our best foot forward. But, sir, I'm a cargo pilot. You've also got mad people skills, Captain. And there isn't anyone on this base I would trust more to pull this off. Sir, I really think you'd be better off with one of the base PAOs. You know, the... If I put a Public Affairs Officer on this, it would make it official, Andrew. We're not supposed to know about this yet. We got nothin' to hide. Exactly, which is why I want you to make sure this bean-counter sees we are 100% mission-focused on this base. The flight from DC lands at 0900 tomorrow. That is all. Understood, sir. Hi! Those look dangerous. Unexploded ordnance? - Used to be. - Uh-huh. Now we just use it to keep tourists off our break. Aren't you a little overdressed for the beach? Aren't you a little underdressed for an officer? Off duty… For eight more minutes. If you're lost, the resort is back that way two clicks. I'm not lost. Just wanna stretch my legs. It was a pretty long flight. - Long flight? - Yeah, 36 hours from DC. Washington? Washington, DC. I think I'm your ride. Huh. Seriously, General Hatcher said your flight lands at 0900. I switched planes in Pearl and shaved two hours off of my trip. In my line of work, I look for ways to improve efficiency. And what brainiac steered you down to the beach? Oh, the same one that tried your cell five times while you were out playing in the water. Oh. So it was one of the smart brainiacs. - Is this military issue? - Nope. It's my Jeep. I wouldn't use a military-issue vehicle for personal use. By the way, the name's Andrew. Oh, I know. I recognize you. From that Stars and Stripes article about cargo pilots providing just-in-time combat support? No, from the ukulele Santa photo in the newspaper. No offense, ma'am, but you don't know the first thing about me. Captain Andrew Jantz, interim commander on G-Series orders for the 734th Air Mobility Squadron. You've been a cargo pilot for nine years. You graduated UCLA ROTC with high honors and a reprimand for a prank involving the colonel's car… And a possum. Well, maybe I know a little bit about you, too. - Really? - Yeah. By that accent, I'd say you hail from Philadelphia. That key chain on your tote bag says you went to Georgetown. And by the way you like to call the shots, you headed your college sorority. Impressive. Wildly inaccurate. The accent is from Boston, but I went to UPenn and lost most of it in a Delaware Valley dialect. And the key chain on my tote is from Georgetown, but it was a gift from the Georgetown School of Foreign Service conference in Qatar. Hey, Claws. You, uh, got that bean-counter yet? "Claus"? Around here, I'm not Andrew. I'm Claws. C-L-A-W-S. It's an aircrew tradition to address each other with call signs. I would have thought "Claus" as in Santa would have made more sense. One picture in a Santa hat isn't enough to earn a call sign. Okay, Claws, why did your general pick you to fly my Jeep this week? Must be his great sense of humor. And your boss sending you here a week before Christmas? Duty calls. You won't find any inefficiencies. I'd like to see things for myself, just the same. Now I understand. Understand what? Why your boss sent you here. So you wouldn't spoil the office Christmas party. Just drive. You'll be staying here. Base housing for short-term guests. You've been up all night. How about you get some shut-eye? - I'll pick you up later this afternoon. - Oh, no. We're starting in 30 minutes. That didn't sound like a question. Yeah, well, I need to change my shoes and answer e-mails. And then I wanna tour the base. I need to interview staff, review purchase orders. Basic fact-finding mission. What do you intend to find? Probably more than you feel comfortable sharing. Sorry it's not the Ritz. But if you see a gecko, remember they're good luck. Don't worry. When you work on Capitol Hill, you're used to all sorts of odd creatures. Copy that. See you in 30. Oh, and, Captain, can you get me a map of the island, a command org chart, and a base acquisition forecast? Would you also like turndown service and mints on your pillow, too, ma'am? The general told me you were here to assist me in any way that I needed. Map, org chart, and acquisition forecast. Roger that. Perfect. You're gonna fit in great around here. Clearly, you like giving orders. See you in a half. The bean-counter has landed. And she is the most high-maintenance, condescending pencil pusher I've ever met. - She, sir? - Is she single? - Is she gonna be trouble? - Not if I can help it. I'm just going to give her the grand tour, let the island work its magic, and she will be out of our hair in no time. Oh! Luck? Why don't you go spread your luck outside or something, hm? Come on. Come on. Shoo, shoo. Come on. No? Okay. It's freakin' me out. Okay. Hey. Aloha! How's paradise treating you? It's not alohahere, Sal. That is Hawaii. Here, they say hafa adai. And, as for paradise, there is a gecko that is giving me the evil eye as we speak. What's up? The boss wanted me to check in, make sure you got there in one piece. Is it hot? It looks hot. It is so hot. I started into it. They assigned me a handler. He's got a huge ego, but nothing I can't handle. Is he a pilot? Why? 'Cause pilots have big egos? But that's okay, because, you know, they're pilots. Good thing the door was open. I don't think my huge ego would fit through the window. Uh… gotta go! Hafa adai. - Don't people knock around here? - The door was open. Yeah, I'm trying to get rid of this gecko. Don't wanna do that. I told you, they're lucky… And the best insect repellent you're gonna find. Uhhh… All right. Let's get started. Your air conditioner is broken. Let's go. This base is home to the 36th Wing in the 734th Air Mobility Squadron. Bombers and heavy transport as well as fighter groups like these F-15s here rotate through on a regular basis. We have operations all around the island. See, despite the impression that the article gave, there is no slack here. Everybody is busy with very serious work. Are those Christmas ornaments? Ornaments and gifts for our local school kids. Part of our community outreach. We'll head to Acquisitions, and then we'll go to the tower. Come on. Okay. I am going to skim this one. Hm… Um… This one. Let's see. You know, I've got all the info on a portable hard drive. This one… Actually, no, the binders work fine. Yep. This one. The elevator's being serviced, but you can leave your stuff at the base of the stairs, or I'm happy to carry it up for you. I'm good. Thanks. This is the tallest tower in all the Pacific Air Forces. Sixteen stories. Originally built in the '60s. Hey, guys, we have a visitor. Sergeant, finish that doughnut. See? Nothing goes to waste here. - Quite a view. - It is, ma'am. Yeah, I, uh… want to come up and see it at night, though. I was leafing through your purchase orders, and I noticed an order for red and green… landing lights. Lights can be handy if you wanna land a plane at night. - Got an answer for everything. - 'Cause I'm efficient. Up next, Detachment Two, the 21st Space Operations Squadron. Do we have to walk? You know, when you visit our island, it's considered bad luck not to visit all five of our beaches. That line work with all the girls? Look, Captain, I appreciate the guided tour, but I'd like to stay focused on base resources. Like I said, we got operations all over the island. What's at Tarague Beach? Oh, it's just a… big swamp. Lot of military assets heading toward a… big swamp. Yes, they must be doing some sort of survival training. Next up, the largest outdoor market on the island. Yeah. Oh, yeah. How much is this? You don't like this one? Okay. Thank you! Hi. How are you? Hey! - Hi, Andrew. - Hi, Noelia. Hey, guys. This is all really nice, but, uh… I came here to observe and report, not, uh, work on my tan and taste the local fare, okay? - Hafa adai, Sue. - Hey, Andrew. - How you doin'? - Good. How are you? - I'm good. Could I grab two, please? - Sure. Oh, by the way, our church's canned food drive was huge. We've got five crates of food for the Drop. - That's awesome! - Yeah! - I'll see you on packing day. - Yeah. Coconut Christmas. This Saturday. What's that about? Probably just some local thing. - Straw. - See you Saturday night, Andrew. Yeah… How do you like that? Christmas colors. It's hard to remember it's Christmas when it's this hot. Actually, will you excuse me for a second? Be right back. Right? Hey, Mr. Mayor. Sorry to interrupt. How are you doin', sir? Let me guess, Cap'n. You want me to donate another generator? The typhoon kicked the crap out of the atolls. Generators are their source of power. We have no way of communicating with them if they can't use their ham radios. I get it. I feel for them. But I'm not in the business of giving away generators for free. They cost far too much. If you don't mind, I'm in the middle of something. Who was that? That is Mayor Sampson. He's probably one of the richest men on the island. And the one with the least amount of Christmas spirit. Someone should invite him to the Coconut Christmas on Saturday and remind him. That's actually a good idea. I'll talk to some of the locals about it who are putting on this local event. It's getting late here. Is this even a road? Quick detour… To the most sensational turquoise beach you'll ever set your eyes on. Maybe run down the clock till I head home? I am offended you even think I would stoop so low. You know what, Captain? Maybe you're right. - I am? - Eh… Can't beat 'em, join 'em. Great! To the beach! To the beach. Nice, huh? - I told you it's beautiful. - Beautiful? Oh, it's amazing. Wow. Aaah! Nothin' beats this view. Man, I have to send a selfie to my dad. - Oh... - Left your phone in the Jeep? - I did. - I can go get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hey! Enjoy the view. Okay. Shut up! Figured you'd come back through the trees. - She left your Jeep for you. - Where is she? Where isn't she? Air Ops, Supply, Wing HQ, Com Squadron. Oh, man! This assignment's gonna be harder than I thought. - Cap'n. - Where's your shadow, Captain? She went rogue, but it's under control. Claws to Andersen Tower. You guys got eyes on Blitzen? Claws, Andersen Tower. Blitzen last seen outside Air Mobility, Hangar Three. Oh, no. Blitzen? Really, Captain? I pitched for "Grinch," but nobody went for it. Hi. We were just, uh, talkin' about you. How'd you find me? Left my phone in your Jeep and tracked you here. Figured the first place you'd go is the last place you'd want me to see. Damn, she's good. So, Air Force base or Claws' little village? - I can explain. - Good. You can start by explaining what is going on at Tarague Beach. I drove by there, and instead of finding survival training, I found Christmas decorations and party supplies. Time to lay your Christmas cards on the table, Captain. Okay, that stuff you saw at the beach is for Saturday night. And all of this is for Operation Christmas Drop. Yeah, I know. It's one of the reasons I'm here. You might know it's a tradition that goes back almost 70 years. Last year, we delivered medicine, food, toys, and gifts to almost 30,000 people, 56 different islands. And we plan to do more this year. I'm sure it's a good cause, but not on the taxpayers' dime. That's just it. Taxpayers don't pay a cent! - I find that hard to believe. - It's funded entirely by donation. Almost all of it from people here on the island. Individuals, businesses, church groups all year long are donating. Clothes, food, medicine, supplies, fishing nets, everything you see here. But what about the military personnel that it takes? Everyone is working on their off hours. That's how much it means to them. Okay. What about the fuel? The wear and tear on the aircraft? The Drop is probably the best low-altitude training these crews get. We'd be flying these planes to train anyways. At least, with the Drop, we're doing something good while we fly. Plus, we get to work with our allies. The Japanese, the Australians. Most importantly, it's Christmas. A lot of the people we help live on some of the most remote islands in the world. If it wasn't for us and the work we do, they'd be on their own. I'm not the Grinch. I get it. It's a good cause. It's good training. I see the benefits. But I have an assignment, and, cost aside, I don't see how this helps the functioning of the base. For a lot of the enlisted kids here, this is their first Christmas away from home. With the Drop, they feel like they're doing something important. Helping people. I'll be sure to mention it all in my report. Yeah, I bet. What is that supposed to mean? I think you had your mind made up before you stepped off the plane. Look, Captain, I'm not gonna tell the congresswoman to take it easy because you have a big heart and a nice smile. So you admit I have a nice smile? Look, we're a family here. And what you say about us could lead to the base closing. - We've heard the rumors. - I don't make the decision. I just write a report. A report you've been told needs to be damning to get to a result some congresswoman needs to fill a quota. That's not true. Give me 24 hours to show you what we do here, starting with the Drop. Then write whatever you want in your report. Captain, this isn't a negotiation. Everything's a negotiation, Erica. I need you to see what we do here. Then at least you'll be writing the truth. - Packing tape. - Packing tape… Well, hold onto that tape. - Hi, I'm... - Erica. - Yeah. - Yes, of course. - I'm Sandra. Come on in. - Thanks. So kind of you to invite me, and totally unnecessary. You're far from home at Christmas. The least we could do is give you a home-cooked meal. Thank you. I like your place. Thanks. When we first moved in, it was a little cinder-block chic. Built to withstand typhoons and good taste. But I've managed to nudge it in the right direction. Are you a decorator? No, actually, I'm the OSS Commander. That would make you... Lieutenant Colonel Blaine, your 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. - Yeah. - Okay! I had no idea that you and the general were married. Dinner's ready! Well, tonight, he is not the general. He's the chef. And he will not tolerate it if we eat cold food, so please take a seat. Okay. Wow! This is wonderful. Yeah. Not only a superb Wing Commander but also a true epicurean when it comes to holiday meals. I'd ask you to carve, Ms. Miller, but I'm hoping to avoid you making any unnecessary cuts. - Hatch! - It's okay, ma'am. I'm just here to write a report, General. My boss is the one making the decisions. And has Captain Jantz been effectively facilitating your report? Yes, very effective in steering me in the wrong direction. But that'll only help me find the right one. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. Sandra, that was great. Are you sure I can't give you a ride? Oh, it's such a beautiful night for a walk. And the sooner I get back to my room, the sooner I have to get back to work. - Your report. - My report. A lot of people's livelihoods are resting on your shoulders right now, Erica. I'm painfully aware of that, ma'am, but, as I said, I don't make the decisions. Well, yeah, you do. Don't fool yourself. Everything that you decide to write in that report will directly impact the lives of everyone on this base. While you're here, you need to meet all these people. You need to see all the great work that they're doing. Lieutenant Colonel, you know as well as I do that, sometimes, hard decisions have to be made for the greater good. As painful as they might be. I tried to tell Andrew that. Just so you know… I mean, Andrew is impossible. But he's the most honorable guy you'll ever meet. - Oh, really? - He's a good person to show you around. And I really hope that you see everything. Thank you. Well, have a good night. Good night, Erica. See? We got three inches today. They're predicting it'll be the whitest Christmas in 30 years. - Ah, makes me feel so Christmassy. - Oh, I wish I was there. Are you crazy? You're in paradise. You sound like the pilot they assigned to show me around here. He's trying to get me to see how beautiful the island is instead of concentrating on the base. Erica, promise me you will try to have some fun. You're on a tropical island. Progress? Yes, I, am… actually… Currently going through thousands of pages of expenditure reports right now, ma'am. Well, forget about that. Matt and his group are working on the base's file plan here. It's all available on the DOD server. I'm surprised you didn't know about that. This is all they offered up. I need you on your A game, Erica. I'm being pushed to come up with comprehensive shutter arguments for three bases. Two of them are easy. One of them is in my district. I need a replacement, and that's going to be your base with its yearly Christmas present toss. Actually, they're not dropping presents. It's a remarkable humanitarian mission that's helping tens of thousands of people. I'm sorry to sound harsh here, but using military equipment to drop Christmas presents in the middle of nowhere can't be justified. That's just it. That's not what's happening here, ma'am. As far as I'm concerned, that's the headline of your report. Don't drink their Kool-Aid, Erica. All right, I'm here. As promised. Great. Ready in a sec. Oh. Love what you've done with the place. Don't knock it. Cardboard is surprisingly strong and unexpectedly stylish. Yeah, unexpectedly. These boxes will all be gone in a couple of days. - What are you doing here? - What? I can't imagine other captains live like this. I like it here. I get to sort stuff on my free time. I don't need much furniture. Anyway, you ready for our trip? Sure. What'd you have in mind? I thought you said we were running an errand! We are. Could've sworn you didn't used the word "helicopter." 'Cause I knew you'd never go. Man, what a day for flyin'. Or crashing into the sea, maybe. I wouldn't worry about that. We have the Navy to thank for letting us hitch a ride. They have all the rotary assets around here, so we gotta be extra nice to them. Go Navy! Beat Army! It's so awesome up here! Sometimes, I look down and realize I have the best job in the world. You know, it's hard to believe that someone like you is a pilot. Yeah? What should someone like me do for a living? Sales of some sort? - What's happening? - We're landin'. Just droppin' in to say hi. Over here. A tropical island in the middle of nowhere. It must be paradise living here. No voicemail. No traffic. No doctors. No stores. No help. Out here, if you can't build it or grow it yourself, you do without. Feliz Navidad! - Feliz Navidad! - Feliz Navidad! - Feliz Navidad. - Feliz Navidad. - And you hope for the best. - Yeah, and there's that. This island's one of the lucky ones. Some of the other islands only see a supply ship once a year. How is it you know somebody all the way out here? John-Michael was stationed at the base. He's one of the best loadmasters I ever had. Used to be? Buenas and hafa adai, cuz. Hafa adai, che'lu. Came back to help my family. They needed a hand. I'm John-Michael. Hi, Erica Miller. Sorry, I didn't mean to be nosy. No, if you're hanging with him, I think someone deserves to cut you some slack. Wow! Shots fired! Thank you. Finally! Someone who understands. Erica's visiting from DC. I'm showing her around the islands. Oh, well, hope you like coconuts. We've got a lot of coconuts. Come on. Let's go. - They're beautiful. - Thank you. Oh! Oh, I loved it. - Please help with that… - Oh, hello, little one! - Hi! - Ha-hey! Good to see you. - You too! - Hey, guys! Welcome to our village. Thank you. It's beautiful. - Love it. - Thank you. That's my niece, Ilana. She's a smart one. - Best reader in grade two. - Right on. - You have a grade school here? - Satellite internet school. But since power got knocked out in the typhoon, school's been out of commission. Hopefully, that's just temporary. We need to find another generator. Sampson said no again? Yeah. I'll make sure we have schoolbooks and mosquito nets for the next drop. - Thanks, bro. - You provide schoolbooks? - Yeah, whatever's needed. - Everything gets used. Boxes, strappings. Even the parachutes are valuable. They get turned into sails for the canoes. Wow! You should see the kids swarm when they hear the planes. It's like Santa himself dropping off presents. Hey, Ilana, I have an idea. How would you and your friends like some markers to draw with? Can I see that? - Markers? - Yeah. Hairbrush. - That's right. - We don't have one. I have a mirror compact in here. Oh, and here's some scrunchies. - There's a sweater, if you ever get cold. - Oh, that's nice! Actually, why don't you just… Take the bag? You can put your seashells in it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is for you. For Christmas. Wow! That's awesome. Thank you. Merry Christmas! I haven't tried that… Now you know how I feel every time I come here. All that's missing is some Christmas music. Ilana, do you know anybody that knows any Christmas carols? Oh, I don't know if now's the time. Play, Uncle. Please! Christmas carols on a ukulele? This should be good. Any requests? Anything to make me forget I'm half a world away from home at Christmas. Let's see. That's good! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! It's really nice that all of you try and help them. We're just doin' the best we can with what we have. No. You made them happier in a few minutes than I've done all year in the Capitol Building. And you did it all with a ukulele. Come on, it's time to show you what we've been up to at Tarague Beach. So, what we're gonna do is hook up 12 volts, uh, charger here. And so you can take the plus, and I'll take the minus. Okay. Be sure it's all cleared. All right, boys, just spread 'em out a little bit. I like that. I like that. Oh, shoot! Yeah, that's good. Put that one up. Here you go. - Hafa adai. - Hafa adai, ma'am. - Andrew. Erica. - Hey. Hafa adai, Sandra. So, every year, we put on this Coconut Christmas fundraiser so we can raise money for the Drop. It stretches resources, but it's worth it in the end. Don't tell me this doesn't cost anything to put on. The wood is offcuts from a local construction company. Everybody here brought whatever lights they can spare. - Uh-huh. - Food is supplied by a local church group. Brother Bruce and Sunshine over there set it up so that we are 100% solar-powered. Brother Bruce? Bruce Best. He's a legend here. He's our link between all the islands and atolls. He's been doing the Drop for the last 40 years. That's nice! - Whoa! - Yeah! That's great. You know, you agreed to give this a chance. That means unplugging that little cash register you got in your head. Sorry. Sometimes, it's on autopilot. But I still don't get what all this is for. To raise money for things that we can't get donated, like generators. We gotta raise a lot of cash. More elves have arrived. We'd better get to work. "We"? Our deal was you'd try to understand what we do here. The best way to understand is to pitch in. Yeah! This looks great. - Do you want to do a few more? - Yeah. Not bad! You've weaved palm leaves before? Last weaving I did was friendship bracelets, Camp Tabonga, 11 years old. You know, I've been part of the Drop since I was a little girl. My dad came from one of the islands. Now my daughter and my grandson help, too. Well, hello there. - Hey. - I see Andrew's already put you to work. Yeah. He seems to have a talent for that. Well, no time for people to be homesick when they have got something to do, right? Hey, Blitzen… need your help over here. We were making palm-leaf wreathes. Eh, we're resourceful. Instead of holly and mistletoe, we got flame tree flowers. Gotta improvise a bit on traditions. So fruitcake made with papaya and pineapple? Instead of Christmas ham, you got Christmas Spam. Instead of sledding at grandma's backyard? Christmas snorkeling on the reef. Oh! That'd be fun. Wait. You've never been Christmas snorkeling? I've never been Christmas, Easter, or Valentine's snorkeling. - You don't know what you're missin'. - I've never even worn a snorkel. Closest I have come is swimming through budget reports while holding my nose. - Long day. - Mm-hm. - But a good one. - That we can agree on. So, I have a question. You're an officer, so… Why aren't you spending Christmas at home? Well… right now, I'm commanding my unit, so I have to be here. But you're right. I could… pull some strings. I'm also the only one here who's an air logistics planner and a pilot, so the Christmas Drop needs someone with my… How should I put it? Unique skill at finagling things. What's your excuse? You could be anywhere, and you're here. I have a lot riding on this assignment. A promotion, maybe a really big one and… Anyways, I like to stay in motion during Christmas these days. By working over the holidays? Don't you wanna be home? My mom passed away three years ago, so… I'm really sorry. We used to have Christmas caroling by the fire and… My mom's voice was loudest of all. There was mulled cider and gingerbread and… Now it's just not the same, so… Especially since my dad got remarried last year. Ouch. No, she's nice, actually. She is. - She's just... - Not your mom? Not my mom. Well, if there is one thing I've learned out here on this island, it's that, though you never wanna forget your traditions, there's always room to make new ones. So, tomorrow, we go Christmas snorkeling. - No. It's already been 24 hours! - What? - We need to hit it hard tomorrow. - Sleeping doesn't count. - You're still on the hook for 12 hours. - My gosh! You're always working an angle, aren't you? Better go, I guess. Work and… Yeah. - Find you in the morning? - Yep. Okay. The big news is, Sheila tendered her resignation. Shut up. Congresswoman Bradford now officially needs a new chief of staff. Oh! And I'm 8,000 miles away, chasing my tail. I'm pretty sure you're still on the top of her list. She asked me for an ETA on your report and to let you know about the job opening up. I can get something to her in a couple days. She'll be on a plane in two days to Singapore to meet with her family for the holidays. Pretty sure she's gonna ask for it before she leaves. Right. Um… I'll just bear down and get it done. Is that a flower in your hair? Oh. Yeah. I just… took a shortcut through some bushes. It's… Mm-hm. It's not like you to take a shortcut, Er. Sounds like that island is working its magic on you. Gotta go. Oh, you should have seen the carolers tonight, honey. Three different groups all trying to out-sing each other! It was just… Man, I miss those cold walks into town with you guys. We could have used you when we got back. Dad made us shovel up the path to the barn. Even though it's still snowing. I'd like to make a toast to us being together. - Oh, yes. - There is nothing… …like family at Christmas. Guys? You're breaking up. Guys? Dad? - And you're gone. - Hey. Door was just open. Yeah, we… We do that here. Am I interrupting? Are you… No. No, I'm all done. Everything okay? Yeah. I was, uh… Just trying to FaceTime with my family. We were gonna have dinner together, but the internet on their end had different plans. Sorry to hear that. Anyway, you ready to go Christmas snorkeling? Actually, I stopped by to say I can't go. - Really? Why not? - I'm getting pressure from Washington. - Speed things up. - That's exactly why you have to go. - Uh... I'm... - As soon as possible. Getting in the water is the best cure for stress. You come out feeling more relaxed, more efficient… If that's even possible for you. Wanna be good at your job? Snorkel. All right. That should do it. Thanks. Ready to take the plunge? As ready as I'll ever be. - All right, let's go. - Now? - Yep. - Okay. - Whoo! - Oh, my gosh! That parrotfish was like a rainbow with fins! And the turtle, I tried to swim back to it, but it kept getting away. And just like that, a new Christmas tradition is born. The Procurement Office has a data drive ready for me, and I have a meeting with the general at Wing Headquarters in an hour. Suit yourself. I've gotta do a bit of horse-trading for the fundraiser tonight anyway. Okay. Captain! Your shipment's arrived. I see that! Wait. Three... How did you get ten Douglas firs halfway across the world? It's not gonna end up in some sort of report, is it? I promise you it didn't cost the taxpayers a penny. I find that hard to believe. So a guy I know in Oregon owns a tree farm. He donated ten trees and dropped them off at Portland at the Air National Guard. They flew them to San Diego because they were going there for training. And a buddy at the Naval Air Station there was flying a C-40 of recruits to Pearl Harbor, so… So that's only halfway. Then, from Pearl, they ended up as freight on a half-empty supply flight to Saipan, where they were put on a Super Hercules already due for depot maintenance here. - Okay, but that doesn't... - But nothin'. Come see what all this free transport gets us. It's time to trade horses. Oh! That's the same one we had last year! - Hey, Andrew! How are you? - Hey, how you doing? - Thank you for bringing the trees. - Thank you for taking them. Hello. - How are you? Good to see you. - Hi. Watch out. It's heavy. All right. Put them in the lobby. - Okay. - So, what's the angle here? Thing you gotta remember is, it's about finding the right angle. - They're beautiful. - I made a deal with hotel management. They are now officially the only resort on the island that carries real Douglas fir trees, just in time for the Christmas Eve banquet tonight. In exchange for what? Ten cases of soap, 20 sets of sheets, 15 packs of rice, six sets of pots that their new chef doesn't really like, and eight dozen eggs for the eggnog tonight. - All that for some trees? - For some free trees. Yeah. And… A little one to brighten up someone's room who's far away from home. All right, let's, uh, finish unloading these so we can get you back so you can dive into that data drive, meet the general, then we have a few hours before we put our party pants on. Okay. Come on. Andrew, over here! - Yeah, that's it. - Wow! A flurry. Coconut shavings away! And that's a white Christmas in the tropics. Oh. Oh, wow. You pack a dress like this everywhere you go? Guess you're not the only one who can horse-trade, Captain. Does it look okay? Yeah. You look beautiful. I like you in blue. Good job, Andrew. I mean, I never knew coconut could stand in for snow. Yeah. Uh, it took us a while to figure that out. Last year, we tried freeze-dried potatoes au gratin. - And, uh… it wasn't pretty. - No? - Hey, everybody, gather in. - Oh, there they are. Let's get this party started. - Oh, come on. Yeah, over here. - Come on. Brother Bruce. You ready for this, Auntie? Let's do it. Ah, ooh! Hacha, hugua, tulu! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! So… So this is what a tropical Christmas is like? Like Rockefeller Plaza with palm trees. Oh! I see a few guests without drinks, and drinks are our biggest mark-up, so I best be on my way. - See you in a bit. - Okay. Whoo! He's, uh… always workin' an angle, huh? Oh, yeah, pretty much. Yeah, smooth-talker. Ladies must love that. Actually, not really. Uh, he may seem like he's got all the moves, but you know how Captain got his call sign, "Claws"? Figured it was because he had his claws in every pretty tourist passing through. Uh, "CLAWS," as in, "Can't Leave Anyone Without Santa." Cap'n steps up whenever anybody needs help. Brings Christmas to everyone, everywhere. Doesn't do anything else, and that's why he can't keep a girl and why he's always here every holiday. I didn't know. Didn't you ever wonder about those living quarters of his? The house of boxes and books? Yeah. Yeah, that one. Captain gave up his officer's quarters to make room for a family comin' in from Hickam. Since family housing was full, Cap'n stepped up, just like he always does. And those boxes are donations that come in throughout the year. He stores them there so they don't take up space on the base. - So good, right? Yeah, love that! - Whoo! You want more power? You add more solar panels, and then you can have your lights and stereo. Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah! - Hey. - Hey. How much money do you need to raise for the Drop? - Ah, it's never enough. - It's a good-sized crowd. Should be. We plastered a bunch of flyers at the resorts and downtown. Hey, why is nobody dancing? Secret weapon time. Hey, Sunshine. - Yes, sir. - Let's do it. - Oh, it's time. - Okay. I'll see you. You're gonna wanna see this. - Here we go. - Okay! - You're kidding! - Whoo! Whoo! All right! Go! Yeah! Okay, for my next magic trick… - My lady, would you like to dance? - Oh, no, thank you. - Is this a Washington thing? - I'm just gonna hold off. Why not? 'Cause I'm a terrible dancer. Just dance like no one's watching. Yeah, it's for a good cause. Exactly. All right! Yeah. - All right, girl, all right! Whoo! - Whoo! - Yeah, go, girl! - Erica. Erica. Maybe dance like a few people are watchin'. I just hope yours isn't to close down our base. I hope not, too. - Yeah! - Whoo! - Yeah! - Oh, yeah! I'd love to. What is it that makes you wanna help people? I grew up on a farm. But then a bunch of our neighbors all got together, and they helped us through it. My folks still live on that farm. I'll never forget the kindness those people showed us. I guess I'm just trying to… Pay it forward. My mom taught me the noblest thing to do was find a need and fill it. Find a hurt and heal it. One of the Air Force core values is service before self. And, sometimes, I wonder if I've drifted too far from the real reason that I got into politics in the first place. Yesterday, I saw you give everything that you had in your purse to a little girl who you barely knew. You're here. And you're helping. You know, I misjudged you. I thought you were this self-centered egotist, wheeling and dealing for your own good. Clearly, there's more to you than meets the eye. - Fire dancers? - Fire! Is something wrong? I missed three calls from DC. - What? - Yeah. It's, like, 4:30 in the morning there. Yeah, I'm gonna wait a couple hours before I call them back. I'm pretty sure I know what it's about. Our tallies are in, Andrew. Thank you, ma'am. What? We did, like, double our numbers… Yeah. …since last year! - Well done. - Oh, thank you, sir. But we're still gonna have to prioritize our choices. Rice, vegetables, seeds, canopy materials. - I don't think there'll be much left. - Mm. What about generators? I wish, but they're a big-ticket item. We're still playing catch-up. I keep thinking about Ilana and her friends with no power, no way to access a web connection for school. Well, Sampson's the only one who stocks them, and he's not willing to play. I might have an idea that'll help him change his mind. That's a great idea! Honey, over here! - I really just wanna… - I want you to have… - Oh, I know! - Yeah, it's really good. There he is. Wish me luck. Oh, sister, you don't need luck. Go get 'em. Okay. - Oh, that sounds fun! - Yeah, that'd be great. Mayor Sampson, hi. Erica Miller. I work with Congresswoman Bradford. On the Realignment and Closure Commission. - The same. Yes. - Oh. Island grapevine has it you're here to try and shutter the base. I'm here to make recommendations about possible mission realignment. Or closure. I know how BRACC works, Miss Miller. And I have to say, shutting this base would bankrupt my business and a third of the rest of the island. I understand that, and I'm making sure to include it all in my data collection. But, Mr. Sampson, I'm not at liberty nor inclined to talk about my report. Fair enough. I actually wanna chat briefly about Operation Christmas Drop. Okay. No, no. I already told Captain Jantz those diesel generators are too expensive for me to give away left and right. Obviously. I mean, you're a businessman, first and foremost. - I'm not here about your generators. - No? No, I wanna make you a business proposition. Okay. Come with me. I wanna introduce you to a friend of mine. What do you know about solar inverters, sir? Second round of rice, everybody. One bag per box. You know what to do. - What? - Yes. That's incredible! Oh! How? What did you say to him? I told him about a couple of initiatives out of Washington that are encouraging businesses like his to switch to renewable resources, and Brother Bruce did the rest. Wow. Guys, Erica just got Sampson to donate three solar-powered inverters to the Drop! - Oh! - Yeah! Nice work, Erica! Thank you! Hey, boss. General wants to see the team in the ready room. - Whoo! Pass it to me. - Come on. Next up, snorkels, fish hooks, and masks! Let's pack it up, people. - You heard him. Let's go! - Yes! Go, go, go! It's a rapidly intensifying cat-four typhoon, and the outermost bands of this monster look like they'll make landfall and sit on top of us in two days. 130 to 150 mile an hour winds in the right front quadrant. Radius, 520 kilometers. Can we get over top of it? We can, but it's not gonna get any presents delivered. It doesn't matter. I can't risk anything off the tarmac with something this big in the way. It's moving slowly, building as it goes, which is both good and bad news. What are the chances it's not gonna hit us? - Slim to none. - What about the outer Islands? They haven't recovered from the last one. Thankfully, on its current trajectory, the worst of this one will miss them, but... Operation Christmas Drop can't happen. Not on this schedule. It may be after Christmas before we get back in the air. Then we need to work faster. Load up. Go now. Anyways, maybe the typhoon will veer off in another direction. The furthest island is 11 hours out and 11 hours back. We just can't make it. I won't put our people at risk. But what we can do is keep sorting and packing right up until we can't. And hope for a Christmas miracle. What? They happen. All right, people. Let's get to it. All right, everybody, final items. Let's make sure you got school supplies. Let's start closing it up. If your friends on the Hill could see you now. If they could see me now, I'd be fired. Okay, my little elves. Bring it in. Yeah, bring it in. - Come on! - What? It's a tradition. - Every year? - Yeah. - What's going on? - Come on. Whoo! Hm. You look good in a Santa hat. Erica, what the heck is going on? Sorry, ma'am, I wasn't expecting you. Sally was supposed to call and tell you that I rerouted through Honolulu. Yeah, I missed a few calls. And the report that I was supposed to have in my hands before I left. But, congresswoman, you didn't have to fly in. Ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm afraid, if anyone's to blame, it's me. I diverted your associate here... Captain, I don't know you, but I recognize your face from that photo in the newspaper. You're part of the problem. Now, would you please explain to me what's going on, because this is obviously Operation Christmas Drop. Yeah, but, like I said, it's all done by donations. It provides resources to people in need over thousands of square miles. People who don't vote in my district. Now, how is this benefiting Americans? Congresswoman, this base is America's forward operating outpost in a region of hostile... Your commander already briefed me on the base's mission. Then you are aware the mission of this base is to provide a US-based war-fighting platform, as well as a rapid-response humanitarian relief program worldwide. I'm going to Singapore in the morning, weather permitting. Erica, I think it's time you went home. But I'm… I'm not done... I'm gonna let Matt and his team take this over, and they can review what you've found back in DC. I want you back at your desk, doing your job. Lieutenant Bradley. I better go pack. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, just like that? What happened to "We're doing whatever it takes"? You heard her. My job is on the line. The winds are picking up, and the typhoon is on its way. If we speed up our packing, we can get a drop off first, before it hits. I'm done with the Drop. And if my boss has her way, you are too. Sorry. Well, Lucky… Guess there's not much truth to the island legend about you. - Hey. - Listen, I am so sorry you got blindsided. - It's okay. - She was supposed to go to Singapore. - I kept trying your cell. - Sal! It's okay. I don't know what I would have done differently, even if I'd known she was coming, so… Just finished packing and saying goodbye to a friend. That pilot? Actually, this one is green with four legs. I've grown kind of fond of him. You sure about coming back home now? What can I do? Bradford was crystal clear. It's just not like you to give up. I know. And this is the first Christmas I've actually enjoyed in a while. It reminds me of something. Reminds you of what? Of Christmas. Like it used to be. Sally, I have to go. I've got something I have to finish. Jake, how about another cranberry and soda? Comin' up. You can go home to your family, man. I'll lock up when I leave. Thanks, Captain. Merry Christmas. Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world… Don't you have a flight to catch? - Could say the same thing to you. - Drop's a bust. Guess we're all out of Christmas miracles this year. - So, you're just gonna give up? - Look who's talking. We should get you to the airport while your flight can still take off. I don't care about my flight. It's yours I'm thinking about. This weather doesn't have to ground you. It has grounded me. I just saw a Christmas tree that made its way all the way from Oregon to San Diego to Saipan… To my living room in Guam. Where there's a will, there's a way… Especially at Christmas. It's a lost cause. The general grounded all transport. There are no lost causes. - Wishing it won't make it happen. - It's not a wish. It's a miracle. I just talked to Travis. He's been on the phone with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at Pearl. They have a P-3 over top of the storm, and they say it's rapidly degrading. General Hatcher said it is up to you, the mission commander, to decide if we take off. If we take off? You called me Blitzen, right? Isn't it my job to deliver presents at Christmas? Look at everyone, giving up their time the day before Christmas. Beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. - Almost as beautiful as this. Can I get everyone's attention, please? The JTWC has just confirmed they downgraded the system to a tropical storm. We are clear all the way to Kapingamarangi atoll. Whoo! Then, Captain Jantz, you are green to go with all three of Santa's sleighs. - Awesome! Let's get this show on the road! - You heard her, Trav. - Fire it up. - Roger that, Claws. Andersen Tower, this is Santa's Helper 01. Control departure time, 20 minutes. Oh, no. - General. Lieutenant Colonel. - Ma'am. I thought I asked you to stop this whole Christmas thing. Yes, you did ask, congresswoman. And I thought I was quite clear that I wanted you on a plane stateside today. You were clear, ma'am, but there's too much for me to do here. I'm sorry? Respectfully, ma'am, what's happening here is far more important than what I'd be doing back home. You're very close to throwing it all away, Ms. Miller. I'm gonna stay here and help. And you should too. I remember, when you first got elected, the cornerstone of your campaign was to make the world a better place. You promised your constituents that you would work on making a difference. These people, right here, are making that difference. I haven't seen any evidence... Well, I can show you some, congresswoman. Come fly with us today, see what we do up there. I don't think the optics... No one has to know who you are or where you're from. Erica can fly with Captain Jantz and his crew. You come with me and mine. Give it a chance, ma'am. I'll meet you afterwards, and I'll give you my report. Okay? Okay. Tower, this is Santa 01. We're ready for departure. Roger, Santa 01. Clear for takeoff. Operation Christmas Drop up and away. Sure is beautiful, huh? I know what you mean. Shouldn't you be keeping your eyes on the road, Captain? Sorry, momentarily distracted. Aah. Can't deliver presents without the right music. All right, crew, we're coming up on the first drop. Ready, Cargo? - You bet. - Cargo's ready, Captain. Roger that. Three minutes out. Erica, why don't you go back to watch? Sunshine will hook you up. - Seriously? - Yeah. Sure. Yeah! Put it on like a vest. All right, we're all buckled up back here, Cap. Copy that, Cargo. - Hold on to this. - Okay. Door's clear to open. One minute out. Acknowledge, Computer Drop Switch. Set auto. Auto set. - Thirty sec out. - Copy. Green light. Whoo! Aah-ooh! - Yeah! - Mmm! - Yeah! - Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! - Yeah! - Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Nice one, Erica! Cool! Toys! And books! Uncle, look at all this stuff! Look what Santa brought! Bye! Bye! Yeah! Hey. Is everything okay? Better than okay! This is what Christmas is supposed to feel like. Yeah, it is. - Whoo! - Whoo! - All right! - Yeah! Whoo! - We did it! - We did! We did that! The other planes are reporting 100% successful drops too! Wow! - So good. - Way to go. Way to go. Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel Blaine. That was… spectacular. And very moving. Well, you are more than welcome, congresswoman. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with once you guys have had your talk. The base could cut waste and maximize efficiencies by privatizing housing and base support functions, like the gym, dining hall, postal support, all contracted out to reduce the overhead. I'll have to see the numbers. Yeah. Sally is working with Matt on getting them for you by the time you hit Singapore. I don't know if it's gonna be enough. Ma'am, my task here was to find the inefficiencies. The problem is there just aren't enough to justify shutting down this base. These men and women are working diligently at stretching every cent they have. Okay? Operation Christmas Drop is just one example of that. Lieutenant Colonel Blaine walked me through the donations, the training, volunteer time. The Joint Chiefs call this island an unsinkable aircraft carrier. Couple that with the training and the work with the outlying communities, you have a very compelling argument to take this base off of the list. Did you see… The look on the faces of the islanders when they saw our planes coming in? I did, ma'am. I haven't seen that kind of joy in a very long time. To see our military making that kind of difference in people's lives, that was what Christmas should look like. - You know, I couldn't agree more. - You're very good at what you do. And I'm so glad you're working with me. See you back in DC. There is an empty desk there waiting for someone like you to fill it. It would be my honor, ma'am. And thank you… for reminding me why I got into this in the first place. Merry Christmas, Erica. Merry Christmas, Angela. - So, was that a "you're fired" hug? - Eh… No. I just wanna thank you… For getting me involved in everything around here. Helping play Santa got my Christmas spirit back. Somethin' told me you had it all along. So… Christmas Eve on the other side of the world. Yeah. It's not home, but we try to make it feel that way. It's not really home though, not without family. Yeah, well, my family is 8,000 miles away, so… Actually, they're only about 80 yards away. They flew in this afternoon. They're getting ready for Christmas dinner at the general's house. What are you talking about? You're not the only one that can cut through red tape. Thank you for having us. This is really great. Uh… What? That... that must've cost a fortune. Didn't cost a cent. There was a TV news crew already flying in to cover the Drop. A news reporter owed me a favor. There was some space on the plane, and I guess I was… Feeling inspired. Someone once made me see that, sometimes in life, you just have to find the right angle. You're incredible! What about your family? I'm gonna see them for a week at New Year's. A whole week? - Yeah. - That's awesome! Yeah. I have to give my stepmom a chance. Can you spend Christmas with my family this year? - Maybe we'll throw snorkeling in. - Andrew. You don't have to talk me into anything.
