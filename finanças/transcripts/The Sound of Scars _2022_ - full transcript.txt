♪ If you don't walk with me ♪ I will walk alone ♪ Yeah, yeah I always felt a bit different, kinda in my own brain, and not in a good way. This kind of sadness that I have underneath the surface, it can get the best of you when you least expect it, even when good things are going on. Life of Agony hail from Brooklyn in New York, and last year, released their acclaimed debut album, "River Runs Red." It was a very important record. "River Runs Red" connected in a way through the messages of suicide that intense raw emotion that was put into that music and into the making of that record. We needed that record at the time and I think people obviously felt it. It just really seemed like everything was moving in this great direction for the band. All the signs were there that we could have seen them become a successful rock band that got songs on the radio. The band was absolutely ready for that level of success but I absolutely wasn't. I didn't know back then the lesson was put a bullet in your head and fucking go Cobain. They had come full circle and successfully transformed into like an active rock radio band. "Soul Searching Sun" was catching on at radio and the band was starting to establish themselves in this new world. Keith left the band. There is no Keith, Keith was a lie, Keith was just a social construct. Keith was an idea to get me out of the abusive home situation that I was in at the time. So Keith was just pretty much a lie. Let's see all you guys get in the middle, one last New York fucking '92 pit, right here, Let's see it!

Who's that, the cameraman? Who's that Princess? What's he doing, he's filming Toni? I'm about 11 years into hormone therapy. You know, biologically transitioning, medically as well. Six or seven years ago I was absolutely way more unstable than I am now. Toni, my doggy taught me everything there is to know about unconditionally loving myself. It's so confusing, it confuses me. Yeah, I guess my name is Mina Caputo, born Keith Caputo by my parents and doctors. But was always really Mina Caputo. The transition started a very, very long time ago and being her cousin and living in the same home, I've seen her transition slowly and there was a lot of signs that something was different about Mina. She hated the concept of Keith. Keep it rolling man. Keith Caputo was a very angry, closed up, introverted type of person. What's the matter, Keith? Fucking asshole. This is as sick of shit, I love it, wow. The mirror, what's going on with the mirror? That's a great shot right there. Yeah, I have a better way to go up that way. So you're really saying that this house hosts? Some past lives? Oh, we read the whole thing about it, it's the most haunted house in Jersey. - That's not right? - I was like, "No, I don't wanna go in." Oh man, this is wild. Oh, I got the chills. Oh my god, with the fucking dolls in the cases, did you guys set that up? Did you set it up or Leigh, that piece of shit? One of my first dolls was a Princess Leia doll; I had to have it, loved the buns. I just loved all things feminine. I used to watch my grandmother at a very young age, put on her makeup. I used to watch her all the time and she used to put lipstick on me and eye shadow and be like, "Don't tell grandpa, he'll kill us." I'm like, "I know I won't." And even back then I was struggling with what I was feeling as a human being like, yeah, I would look in the mirror and I would see this little boy's body, but I knew this femininity was raging. I know deep down inside, I'm a woman but born without the parts. It's such a confusing thing, people have no idea. We all get really pumped up for the shows. It's where you get to release all that pent up energy. Come on! Come on! It's been a deep passion of mine, getting on stage, performing in front of all those people who love the band. I can not wait to hit the stage and go absolutely ape shit. And this isn't ego talking. I know I am where I belong, and I'll always be here, I'm not going anywhere. Whether I have to suffer, eat less, live differently, I'll be doing music, I don't care. I met Joey first; people love Joe. They gave him a nickname, they called him Skinny Joey Z.

I'm ready to do it again. Ready to fucking do it again and again, and again. 30 Years together, the family bond that the three of us have, you know, Mina, Alan and I, we're inseparable. Mina, Keith back then, was more on the quiet side, kind of detached. It was hard to tell if he was having a good time or not. You know, we really didn't think past next week, let alone 30 years. What time is it there? I think it's close to 11:30 at night. I'm in England. You look very tired, you look like your eyes are little slits, where are you going tomorrow? We're in Birmingham, England. - England, yeah, okay. - I love you. Right, well have a great show, I love you so much. - Love you guys. - I do miss you like crazy. Check this out. This is October 31st, 1989. This is just a few months after "Life of Agony" started and that's Michelle and me, we were just little teenagers. I see your little head peeking up. What are you gonna be for Halloween, Mishy? Who are you gonna be? - Me! - She's gonna be Smokey You're gonna be you?! Gonna be you. - Are you gonna be me? - Yeah. That's gonna be hard for you to pull off. - Joey Z - You gonna be Joey Z? When I'm home I'm the protector, you know, that's just how it is. And you know, they feel my absence. And you're gonna miss my speech for student council Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. And Halloween. That's the hardest thing about being out here. I can't imagine having the situation with them that I had when I was young, you know, it's a completely different, completely different vibe. My dad, he struggled with alcohol. He needed it to get through the day, whether it was his job, whether it was his in-laws or whatever it was, there was an excuse why he had to drink. But the alcohol had a very bad effect on my father, he got very angry. And everybody was violent. My grandfather was violent against my grandmother, against Keith at the time. So it was everywhere. And then I became violent and nobody wanted me around because I'd always make a scene. I had psychological problems, emotional problems. I was verbally abused. I was physically abused by my dad's dad. You know, I was constantly pushed away. I was made to feel guilty because they were taking care of me. ♪ But all is not forgiven As my grandfather was beat the shit out of me, then you'd have Joey's drunk dad start beating him up for no reason at all. It was like, it was fucking chaos. ♪ So when we gonna get together ♪ Remember the raging bull scene? "Oh, bring it over, it's like a piece of charcoal." She brings it over, "Hey, you want your fucking steak?" She puts the stake on. "Ergh!" Then fucking De Niro turns the table upside. I Kid you not, every other fucking night, the food was all over the kitchen. My grandmother was in the corner getting kicked and punched and beaten. And then there was me, this little fucking 12 year old kid jumping in front of my grandmother to take the beating, to deflect the beating that he was giving to my... This was my life, this was my life. And people wonder why I don't bother with anybody. ♪ One, two, three ♪ Got time, but you aint got time ♪ ♪ Got time but you're never gonna make time ♪ ♪ Got time, but you got no time for me ♪ ♪ This time ♪ This time ♪ This time Both my parents worked in the school system and my dad had a second job and he was always working, my dad, they were just very busy and you know, me and my sister were latchkey kids in a way. Why did you have that knife? That was pretty scary. I was into Rambo. I know, but that you were allowed to have, look at that knife! It's terrible. Alan graduating, so proud. I pretty much grew up in this room. My friends would come here late at night sometimes, we had the side entrance. So once my folks were asleep for the night, we'd just come down here, play music, all that stuff. It was like the hangout spot, because there was no supervision. We definitely like extreme music growing up. That aggression that was boiling up inside of us because of whatever was going on at home. You know, you got it out through the music. You know, in the neighborhood, we were the ones being punks. Not proud of it. Breaking windows, destroying other people's property. This is the way we, this is just who we were. I wanna see this ceiling fucking come down... You see that fucking ceiling torn down? We tore this place apart We were bad kids. Whatever was inflicted on us, we kind of inflicted it on other people. We've been best friends our whole lives. I've loved Mina the same from when we were kids. We did everything together. And to the point where I almost feel like I've hurt, not intentionally, someone like my brother and not gave him or them I should say, my brothers enough attention because of how much attention I gave Mina. We hung out, we fought, there was a lot of violence. I carried a hammer or a screwdriver or a butcher knife. Okay, don't get too close! If I had to walk my friend home, two blocks away, I carried a frigging, I carried a butcher knife man, in my pants. I think every aspect of my life was violent. The hardcore scene and the metal scene saved us. You know, it was a place to exorcise all these demons in a sense, and in a way it still is. Take a walk down 62nd Street where heavy metal lives. First of all, L'Amour's was like in the kind of industrial part of town. Welcome to L'Amour. Kids would rob you on the corner as you're trying to get in the show. Well, tonight Tony, they're packing it in here at the L'Amour dance club and the police have been here to make sure everyone behaves. Will they be moshing? That's the dance where you get on the stage and just jump off into the hands of strangers and hope they catch you, would you do that? L'Amour's is where we grew up. The scene was very segregated. It was the skinheads, there was the Nazi skinheads, there was the metal heads. ♪ Hard enough to believe in myself ♪ ♪ When I know they don't believe in me ♪ If you were different, you were pointed out. ♪ Unwilling to change for society ♪ ♪ We'll be who the fuck we wanna be ♪ If you were in a hardcore club, there was a good chance you're gonna get beat down. ♪ I want to tear it up, tear it out ♪ ♪ Let my aggression out Mina And I, and I believe Alan was there too, went to go see Slayer at L'Amour's, and I remember there was such brutality in that room that night. ♪ So when will it end, when will it end ♪ The rules were, if somebody falls down, you pick them up unless they're asshole and then you stomp their face. The pit was the excuse to hurt somebody. You were getting hit and you were hitting back. I saw someone with a little billy club knocking people out in the back of the head. I wasn't dancing, I was just beating kids up with Blackjacks. That's how brutal it was; there was blood teeth, broken bones, broken faces and we were a part of it. My first concert was going to L'Amour's to see Biohazard. I never saw anything like it. It was just bodies flying everywhere, big pits breaking out. Loud, dirty, it was great. It was an eye-opening experience. I got hooked on live music from that. Alan and Joey, they came to our rehearsal spot. They wanted to be our roadies. Joey showed up and he was wearing a shirt, a Biohazard shirt that he bedazzled at the back with skinny Joey Z. I was like, "This kid's fucking awesome!" The two of us roadied for Biohazard. You know, we were fans deep down and we would stage dive in the middle of the set and climb back up and help them out with the next guitar change, you know, it was just that kind of environment. Mina was too young to get in CB's. We would put her in a drum case, roll her backstage and hide her in like, you know, put the drum case around a bunch of other cases. And then when we got ready to go on stage, five minutes, like the intro was on and we were ready to fucking blow the place up at CB's and we'd open up the case, Mina would jump out and then stage dive and then wreak havoc during the show. That's what the scene was all about in New York, it was about getting together and then letting out that aggression on each other, but yet walking away and shaking hands and giving each other a hug after you just knocked some guy's teeth out. Some of the very first comics I used to draw were very violent. Mostly revenge stories that ended in a bloody massacre of sorts. It kind of helped me come out of my shell in a lot of ways. Kids would crowd around me and see what kind of crazy monsters I would draw. And I made a lot of friends like that without having to say a word. There's the school we were at, on fire. South Shore High School. Demented Retribution was a band that I sang for back then. He was cutting off his willy. That helped me a lot, not be so isolated because I guess that's my nature. Even now, you know, I draw my books for eight, nine hours straight, alone in this room. And you just get lost in your own thoughts and go to dark places. I think my folks were not in tune with what I was going through emotionally. They didn't think too much of it, you know, I wasn't doing anything damaging to anybody, I wasn't being violent around them. I feel like I've always had some sort of depression and it just comes in waves, and just something you fight. I don't know why both kids are depressed. We are not the depressed people. You know, of course, some days you feel down, but in general we're pretty up. - Yeah, we've had a good life. - Yeah. It's something you're born with, I guess, you know. Environmentally, I don't think that's what caused their depression. We used this concept for "River Runs Red". I don't know, these images come to my mind and then I draw them. But this ties into the whole "River Runs Red" theme of slitting wrists and suicide. To me like, suicidal thoughts is normal in my mind, because I have the same kind of thoughts. It's like, doesn't everyone think that way, you know, it isn't that how everyone thinks, that's not normal? I came up with this logo trying to represent the pieces of the puzzle that made Life of Agony as like four people. I guess that's Mina. Yeah. My father has never been around, but he taught me the world. He taught me what not to do. There's heroin, there's coke, there's ecstasy, there's drugs all over the place, you know? And it's like, I think if I was brought up with my father, then I would've probably been dead already. - We had two houses: my house, right next door was my grandparents, my mother's parents and which they were raising Mina. Well we were always together. - Yeah. - Yeah. He's a good, good kid. Why was I living with my grandparents? Because my dad was a junkie and my mom was dead and there was no other way to take care of me. My aunt Marilyn, Mina's mom, she passed away from a heroin overdose. She was doing heroin with Mina's dad, Tony, at the time. My mom, she found my uncle Tony and my aunt Marilyn. OD'd basically, with Keith in the playpen crying. And my mother was pregnant with me at the time, and then I guess Marilyn didn't make it and Tony did. It was horrific. I feel like her mother died to save her life. If Marilyn didn't die, Mina would've died. When Keith, Mina was brought into our lives, 17 months old, all he said was, "Un." I remember that, "Un, Un," but he didn't even know how to talk; they didn't talk to him. I don't think he was fed, I don't think he was cared for at all. She didn't know that her mother overdosed on the couch and she didn't know that her father was a drug addict. We just tried to give her a good life as a little boy with my two boys. I've written so many songs here, I've come here to like really find peace and harmony and I go out to the boardwalk, look at the ocean for hours on end, read, come here at nighttime with lovers, have sex. Smoke blunts, drink 40's back in the day. This was our summer place to go to really, and it's quite sentimental. This is the only... This is the only part of my mother's life that I've actually, like ever seen or could actually touch, like her hair, haven't touched her hair in so long. Yeah, oh ma, my poor mother, she didn't even get to live. The poor thing. Part of her is living through me, and that's why I'm the way I am too. There's probably several reasons why I'm the way I am. I don't think there's just one reason why people like me exist, that are pushing the envelope with the fluidity of consciousness and the genderlesness of life. I grew up thinking that my grandmother was my mother, and at some point in my life, I was like, "Mom, why are you living with grandpa?" And why does daddy come to see me only when I'm sick? "And why does he come to see you just to grab money?" And they like, they delayed the truth, thinking that they would be protecting me, but instead they created more damage for me and more confusion. And I think that's why also I have a lot of trust issues in my life these days, because I didn't trust the nest I came from. In fact, I had no real secure nest. I blame my brother. I blame my brother for all this because he was the drug addict, the bad seed. Remember the bad seed? My brother was the bad seed. ♪ Well maybe I'm just a bad seed ♪ I think people connect to their story. I think the lyrics and the songs have such raw emotion to them. I think their whole lives and their experiences, the blood, sweat, tears, the pain, the love, the beauty, it's all in there. There's a vibration that they're giving off on those records that just connect with people. I know I feel it too, 'cause I was a fan before I was in the band. ♪ Well maybe I'm just a bad seed ♪ ♪ Of the family All we wanted to do was play great music and Alan's brilliant brain and how he put our stories of our lives into the lyrics of the songs, I mean that brilliance right there is what really connected us to our fans and made Life of Agony such a cult type of band. We were so close and confiding in one another about our feelings; those stories and those things that Joey and Mina were going through affected me personally, because we were so close. Those stories would come out in my lyrics. "Enough of this world, enough blood in these eyes. So, so, so sick of this life. It's about time that I realized this hate from inside. Enough blood in my eyes, call it what you will, call it suicide. Disregard how you feel, I'm just feeling my mind. Clench my teeth as I sleep. "So, so sick of this life." Mina's always the voice I have in my head when I'm writing songs and I'm thinking about melodies. She brings my lyrics to life in a way that I can't, I wouldn't even try to. She has an uncanny ability to take lyrics that I write and make 'em her own. And I think by the time it comes out of her lips, they're hers. And I remember the day that I asked Mina to come down the block with me to sing. I was an introvert. I didn't want people looking at me. I didn't want to look at anybody. Mina said, "No, I can't sing." And I said, "I heard you sing many times" in front of that piano; "come down the block with me and give it a shot." She says, "Okay." Carries my amp with me down the block, plugs into the microphone. That was the beginning of Life of Agony. I didn't really want to be in a rock and roll band. I wanted to emulate Nina Simone. Mina ended up picking up an insect repellent can and sang in the garage off the insect can. I was playing in a little garage band and Joey and Mina were in another band. That's the way to do it, man. And then Alan, you know, he was jamming across the street and come join our band. And then we finally had a bass player and that's when it became Life of Agony, when Alan brought the name and said, "I have a great name, I had a dream." We are Life of Agony and we're here to make you motherfuckers move tonight! ♪ Was it me, honestly The Life of Agony name itself was probably the most dark thing that I could think of at the time. ♪ Never look back We started in the hardcore scene. But I have to tell you that we really never fit in. We were looked at like, what the hell is this? ♪ Till you see the only remains ♪ Like, what the heck is this? People did not get it. Although we had these heavy riffs, and we were very influenced by hardcore bands and we kind of stuck out. We got a lot of flack in the beginning from a lot of the other bands. But the funny thing was is that the crowds really liked us. Well, we had played L'Amour's mostly on Sunday nights. It took probably two years until we were able to pack that place by ourselves. I don't know if it was just because we were different. Whatever it was, we were drawing a lot of people to our shows. I think that kind of anger and angst and you know, broken homes and violence at home that all, you know, it all fueled everything. It fueled the bands that were writing that kind of music, it would fuel the people coming to see that type of music. You could feel the momentum of the band just growing and growing and national acts would put us on just to make sure the place was filled. That's when Roadrunner started to have an interest. It took a while to convince Monte Conner, the ANR guy that he should sign us. He had a lot of reservations; he wasn't sold on the sound. Keith's voice was very different and unique. When I had heard him sing for the first time, it was like nothing I'd ever heard, there was nobody that sounded like Keith back then. I couldn't really wrap my head around it. And then the light bulb went off and I realized that that is what made the band unique. So once I realized that, I just embraced it. We signed the deal and we recorded "River Runs Red" and it came out October 12th, 1993. And it really made an impact. I mean, that record basically exploded out of the gate and put the band on the map overnight. When Life of Agony came up, they injected a lot more melody into a genre that wasn't too accepting. ♪ Can't it wait, can't it wait, can't it wait ♪ ♪ Just a minute now, just a minute now, come on ♪ So they created something new in a very close-minded hardcore genre. ♪ 'Cause I'm colder than ever, colder than ever ♪ ♪ I said I'm colder than ever, I'm empty ♪ When it comes to Life of Agony, how we write has a lot to do with personal values, personal feelings, and... It's like a personal diary, opened up to the public. The band style is rooted in the hardcore scene of their home city, but in vocalist, Keith Caputo, they possess a man capable of breaking the boundaries of the genre. I mean the album, it's been said, is loosely based on the concept of suicide. You know, it's a rough thing to talk about. Exactly, a brave subject to tackle. We had to go out there and we survived. We did it with no help, we really did it on our own. Our first tour, we were sent to Europe. Yeah! Wassup? Fucking Hamburg, man. Years ago, I had a calling card in a phone booth somewhere; whether it was snowing in the middle of Germany, you know, you're in Poland and you've got to find a phone booth and use this calling card and hope you could get through. And I remember freezing, you know, shaking, cold, trying to use the phone. And it was almost impossible to connect with the person at home. It was like scary. It was frightening, overwhelming, insane. It just took on its own life form, this whole thing. Just put it this way, you gotta be careful for what you wish for. A lot of things were over my head. Knowing how stressful and how, I mean it is rewarding and it does have its rewards, but man, it's just like, it's a nightmare sometimes, you know. All throughout the nineties, even in the beginning, she felt out of place. She wasn't really the true front person. I remember getting upset after some of the shows, when I didn't see the crowd reacting, maybe the crowd was so focused on what's going on with the singer, what's wrong with the singer? The singer's had his back faced to us for three songs. I would feel the need to step up my game constantly and go even harder. When the band became successful, I was definitely not prepared for it. In a very alpha male situation. I knew that she would go out to clubs and dress like a woman; I knew that she had that side to her, but I didn't know to what extreme. I hung out with transsexuals even before I was out. In fact, that's how I learned even more about myself through these trans women that were clubbing and escorting and I was selling dope and drugs to people at the clubs and I was like crazy. You know, all the girls knew me, they didn't know that I was trans myself. We didn't even know the word transgender back then. Even though I was living out my boy masculinity, it was apparently and abundantly clear that I was a very feminine, you know, guy to people. - Yeah, this is a dildo. - Uh-oh. This is my brother, Zamp. And I even actually went with her to one of the clubs just to be the bodyguard, with all the freaks all over the place. And I was just kind of letting people know that, you know, don't fuck with her because I'll turn that place upside down. I could feel this self in me. I didn't want anyone else to see it. It was very sacred to me. I didn't want to let her out in a sense, being very over-protective. ♪ One, two, three, four This is like the first giant festival we did. I don't know what possessed me to jump into the crowd of 100,000 people here. They tried to steal my sneakers. This is the beginning of the tour, and I was thinking, "I can't survive the tour without my sneakers. I gotta get outta here." Growing up, all I did was watch VHS tapes of my favorite bands playing these gigantic festivals in these gigantic stadiums, and then getting to step on the stage at Dynamo 1994 in front of 92,000 people and they go absolutely ballistic. I had tears rolling down my face at that show. I'd never felt anything like it in my life. I didn't want to get off the stage; at that moment, I knew we belonged on stages like that. And it was like, this is what we're made to do. It scared me a lot. There would be chaos for us. I was just hoping people wouldn't get hurt. And then their kid died at our show, and then I wanted to quit right after that because it was like all of my fears in a sense kind of came true. Now that update on that exclusive story we told you about, a young man who died in a Brooklyn nightclub. Last night, we told you of the 18 year old's final night when he went to this Brooklyn dance club, L'Amour, to see the band Life of Agony, tragically, this turned out to be his ticket to death. Chris was allegedly pushed by bouncers; hitting his head on the floor, he died the next day. So this is the story of Chris Mitchell who lost his life at our show at L'Amour's. Basically they were accusing this bouncer of throwing the kid off the stage, which, found out that didn't actually happen. There was a whole court case and we were actually brought in to be witnesses on a grand jury. Apparently the bouncer didn't push him. The band was leaving the stage after the show and that the audience was leaving the club. And because he was intoxicated, he did one last stage dive and fell on his head and no one caught him. So that's apparently what happened. After that, we said, "We gotta stop." We can't have anyone getting hurt anymore like this. "You know, we can't have anyone dying at our show." Well, it's still something that sticks with us. And that's top of mind when our crowds get too wild. We had some pretty awesome pits going on, but what I feel like happens at a Life of Agony show, you know, someone falls, they get picked up and Mina enforces that from the stage. Guys listen, this guy cracked his fucking head open or whatever the fuck. Whoo! Just no stage diving, all right. Aww. Well bring a fucking helmet to the fucking show, then. ♪ If I knew what to do I'd do it ♪ ♪ If I knew where to go I'd get there someday ♪ ♪ If I knew where to fly I'd fly away ♪ ♪ Forget about life for a while ♪ ♪ But it never is that easy ♪ To just pick up and go and do as you're told like ♪ ♪ 'Cause life never works out that way ♪ ♪ If it were true the skies would be full everyday ♪ The "Ugly" record is probably my least favorite because it just, I remember everything that happened during that era of the band and my life. And that was probably my lowest point. Touring at that time for me, it was very difficult because I was sober. Al, what are you drinking, man? No beer, right? You know it, you know it kids, straight at you all the way. No drugs, no alcohol, '94. I've never tried drugs. And on the road, everyone was all fucked up all the time and I felt very isolated and trapped. Sometimes I felt like the odd man out. I was in college, so my brother was like around 22, this is 1995. I have lots of letters like this, but this was just one that I happened to pick up. "I feel lost." I feel like I'm everywhere I don't want to be, but at the same time, I can't imagine where I'd go. I have turned inward in the past instead of reaching out and that made my problems worse. The problems within my own band have made me miserable, "suicidal at times and numb at others." I felt bad about myself and I didn't want to be here anymore. Nothing would have made me happier than to see them find me hanging in a hotel room, as dark as that seems, that's where I was at. These are images that I would fantasize about at my lowest point. That was actually something I thought about, you know, why? I don't know, what was so bad that was going on in my head that that was actually an option? I didn't even know him yet at that point when he was going through that, so by the time we met, you know, it was kind of in the rear view mirror. I could be myself with her. She was the only person that I could be completely myself and it just never felt like I had a partner in this life until I met Crissy. We both struggle, it is what it is. We have to keep ourselves in check. We have to keep it together all the time. My daughter brings a lot of joy that we didn't have before, so that makes it easier, it does. We were over the moon, you know, when she came into our lives and she has such a happiness to her naturally, she's a happy kid. I guess that's a self portrait. I knew all of them for a very long time. Joey, super friendly; Mina and I were like, we just instantly became friends. And I would say, I knew Alan the least, I really didn't know him back then. Mina was my buddy. She came to my apartment and said she needed to talk. She said, "I'm leaving Life of Agony," and I screamed at her and I ripped her head off, and I said, "Are you out of your effin' mind?" ♪ I look in the mirror ♪ And guess what I see You know they just had the third album out and I said, "You cannot do that." - I was heavily doing drugs: cocaine and OxyContins. I was on a death mission and I thought, "Oh, I'm never gonna come out. I'm never going to be able to live my full, full life." Like the older you get, the more I find myself looking out my window, wondering what I'm gonna be doing and where I'm really going. ♪ My mind is chaotic She was just miserable, and she just couldn't go on. I bought a gun, 'cause I was shooting bullets in the roof of our apartment, you know, on eight balls, till our noses were bleeding. ♪ I just can't help myself Putting the gun, the barrel of the gun in our mouth and pulling the trigger. ♪ And my mind is dangerous ♪ And that's who I'll always be ♪ Things were not right, and the label could never understand that, the band didn't understand that. We played Irving Plaza. Sold-out show, the very next morning, she called me. She goes, "Al, I can't do it anymore." I said, "Okay." It was the shortest phone call we ever had. I didn't yell at her, I didn't... I wasn't, you can't force someone to do something. I knew something was going on with her back then. She kept describing it as, "I'm in too much pain." I can't do this anymore." That was the hardest time of my life, when Mina left, just after "Soul Searching Sun" came out. Oh, it was just the worst timing possible. We had everything lining up to be something really big and really special and that all went away in one day. We had this amazing record, people were reacting to it. "Weeds" was getting played on the radio. Well, it just really seemed like everything was moving in this great direction for the band. And they had successfully transitioned into a different sound. All the signs were there that we could have potentially seen them become a successful rock band that got songs on the radio. It was so hard to accept. I remember crying my eyes out in bed; I cried for days. I went into such a deep depression. I love my cousin no matter what and I tried to be understanding, you know, at the time, although I had some anger, you know, there was some anger in there. When Joe gets overwhelmed, like when Life of Agony, would somehow just get pulled from under him, he'll stare at the wall. He won't take it out on anyone. He'll just kind of go silent for a little while, but he's built such amazing coping skills as he's gotten older. I've never seen anybody fall down and pick themselves up more than Joey. He's able to just shut it off and turn something else on and pick himself up and look at the bright side. Whoo! Inherently we're survivors, you never wanna give up. I remember there was a magazine where we were on the cover presenting our new album, as Life of Agony, and in the back, we had an ad for a singer, in the same magazine. I think at that point, we were kind of scratching at anything we can grab onto to hold onto Life of Agony. We did a damn good job of it when we got Whitfield Crane on vocals. I was in a band called Life of Agony in 1998. And it was a very important experience for me. Well, it was a challenge, it was a challenge every day. It was warranted challenge. They'd adopted an Ugly Kid Joe singer, that was known for two pop songs, and joined a legendary hardcore band. You know, those fans are loyal and all of a sudden there I was, you know, fronting that band. Every show would start off with some folded arms being all "prove yourself Whit Crane" and prove myself, I did. This song is called, "River Runs Red". ♪ I got the razor at my wrist 'cause I can't resist ♪ ♪ I've got this fever burnin' fist that does as I wish ♪ ♪ But when I get downtown, and see what's around ♪ ♪ I just know there's got to be a better place to be found ♪ Ever since those guys, I was like, "Fuck it." If I can do this, I can do anything." We started to get our legs again. We did the Oz Fest, theater tours with Megadeath. We played huge festivals and it's almost like we didn't miss a beat. On the surface, it worked, but the feeling of doing it without Mina was not the same; personally, I missed her. Although Whitfield is an amazing talent, it just wasn't Life of Agony to me. Life of Agony to me is Mina's emotions coming out of her soul when she sings. We had to go on our own journeys. I had lost my friends, lost my band I moved back to my parents' house in Brooklyn. I mean, I was a mess. For me, it started all with Mina leaving LOA. - Mm-hmm. - It was never really LOA to me after that, it just was this slow decline that was ripping my fucking guts out. - Yeah. - And it affected our friendship, and that really sucks, you know, because we ended up having to do things separately to find ourselves back here one day. Well, the whole situation was just fucked for me. We weren't close for a little bit, you know, it was a couple of years there that I don't know if we had a lot of contact at all. Oh, look at this lyrics that I've written on. "I'm all numb." Don't know what I'm doing here, it's no fun. On my own, everyone around me is glass. I can't love, I don't know what it really means. "My dick is my lethal weapon, it's my suicide." I remember when I was living as a guy, it was subscribing to the marriage and the white picket fence and the dog and the kid and the this and the that, like that was never my life really. Living in the feminine and expressing thee feminine the way I do it, there is no other way for me. A lot of people that I have met, they wanna be with someone like me. They wanna use and feel this body, but they want it to be hidden or they can't take me home to the family, or it's a secretive thing and that gets very tiring after a few years, you know, been there, done that. "Help me find a better place, I could grow, mother I need to crawl back into your womb." Probably scattered drug thoughts. Estrogen and estradiol distributes blood in all the desirable areas in the body. It is a pretty powerful drug. I've had moments where I had the needle, partly in my leg and I just, I couldn't get it in because I was thinking of how my mother and father were suffering. The relationship I had with my dad, I didn't really have one. Watching him fall down flights of stairs, calling the ambulance, you know, pulling needles out of his hand, wrapping up his hand that was blown up like a half a grapefruit because he had gangrene in the fucking hand. I didn't wanna talk to him. He came to me one day and was like, "When I die, I want you to cremate me." And a week later, like they found him in a hotel. I had to identify the body. I laid down with his body and I watched the medic straighten him out. That was the most empirical, most empowering experience I've ever been through as a human being. Just, wow, my dad, I knew he'd found peace because he was tortured, but like it all just made sense, and when I laid down with him, all the fluids started coming out of his nose, his mouth, 'cause he was like literally, he must've been on his knees. His whole face was smashed, 'cause his body was laying there for six to eight hours. So he had no face, basically. And when I laid down next to him, I felt like that's when his soul left his body and I felt it. I wanted to live, I didn't wanna die anymore. At the wake, Alan showed up and we had a talk and we literally bonded immediately as soon as the three of us were in the same room again together; we missed each other so much. It was really emotional, and I think that was the moment right there that Life of Agony was once a band again. It was almost like an unspoken thing, how much it meant to all of us to have each other. And why wouldn't we wanna do some great things together again? Most of the songs on "The Broken Valley" were related to the death of my father. We poured it all into that record. Watching Mina lose my uncle Tony like that, it was very sad, very painful for a lot of people. It got me thinking about my situation with my dad and how I really needed to get things back on track. Please return to the security checkpoint to retrieve... There were a lot of short fuses growing up. I would actually hate to see that doorknob sometimes turn. I remember it was a very sad and scary feeling when he would come home at night. You know, most of the time he was already drinking from work. It made him very angry and violent. You know, we all have that limit that we can hit. You go into the red and that's a different story. He doesn't remember much of what happened, it's sometime became a big blur, but I can see the sincerity in his eyes and how sorry he was, that he felt like he lost us. Hey, hey Pop, hi. I don't wanna call on my feet. Well, you gotta come in, come on. You sure? You're sure? Don't worry about it. I was born in '45, 1945 in Brooklyn. And my father was a drinker, a baker, a hard worker, and he'd be in the bar all day. He would take me, put me on the stool next to him, call the bar tender over and the bartender would give me a shot glass with a little bit of whiskey inside of it. Yeah, this is what they did back then, this is the truth. And they gave me the shot glass, and here I am sipping Scotch. How old were you? He had to put me on the chair, I don't know. I was just old enough where I could cross Broad Street without getting hit by a trolley car. My father, when he did drink, there were times where he had a bad temper. Something in his life went wrong for him to be like that, something had to happen. Back then in Brooklyn, there were a lot of gangs. You cross into their territory, you could get hurt. One day I was confronted, and they backed me into the wall. I went into a rage, and I beat all of them, one at a time into a pulp. I couldn't believe that I had so much of that anger inside of me, unleashed like that. It was the surroundings, the neighborhoods, the times, it just press on you. There's some deep down rooted bad feelings, I guess. His uncontrollable violent emotions that he would go through. The rage never felt good. It never, never, never, ever felt good. At the time, it was something that couldn't be controlled. And I tried so hard to grasp reality. I couldn't get... can't get your hands on it and say, shake me, "Wake up!" - Yeah. - You know. I couldn't do it. These are all lost years, you can't get them back, they're gone, that hurts. He just got out of control to the point where there was a family brawl and a lot of people were involved in this brawl. And my grandfather had hit my father with a bicycle over the head and actually fractured his skull. And my father fell and then broke his face and then the pool of blood and the ambulances. And I saw this and you know, and that was the last day my father was allowed to live at home. I never wanted to leave you guys. I know. It was the hardest thing in my life to leave you guys. He felt like he lost us. And that would be the... to lose your children? I'm sorry, man. I'm not a kid anymore, I'm 74 years old. I know. And now when the new year comes in, I'm 75. So, I gotta act like a man, and man up to it. I tell him everything is okay now, and I mean it, I mean it, 'cause I love him. And you know what? I wanna tell you this while you're alive. Yeah. I don't wanna tell you this, staring at your lifeless body in a box. Yeah, I know. I want to tell you that I love you and I always loved you. That American dream of family and home, I lost it. I remember the first time my dad met my children. He broke down hysterical, crying. I cried, everyone cried, I mean, the kids were confused because they were young, but they were like, "Hey, this Grandpa Z?" "this is your grandpa," you know? And he was beyond blown away, my father, with the joy and the happiness to meet his grandchildren, that I brought them up there to meet him. And it was a very joyous moment, it was, it was wonderful, actually. They are the love of my life. I would do anything for them; if I could, I would. And having this brings that dream back to life again, and I wish them a life that I didn't have, and I'm gonna help them achieve that. You never forget, but at the same time, I think in life, you have to find that place of peace within yourself and you have to let things go. He's a healed man now, he's been great, he's an artist. He's finally found his passion that his parents, long time ago in the old days in Brooklyn, wouldn't let them do art, they ripped up all his art. That kind of stuff molds you into who you become. We are changing things, we are making a conscious change, you know, to stop that type of abuse, stop these types of things from happening because all it's gonna produce is negative, bad people. You need something to allow those emotions to come out, whether it's art, whether it's music. When are you gonna go away again? I actually gotta leave this Tuesday. When are you coming back? I will be quick, I promise. What is this love fest going on? I wanna get in this love fest. Ooh, are you all right? - Yeah. - Tough luck. Hey Moms! - Brown sugar. - Brown sugar? - Or honey. - All right, okay. That's it. - This much. - - Oh, the finale right? This much coffee. This much coffee. This much penis. - No, no, no, no. - Oh. Course I gotta go there with my aunt Ro. Right, censor that. First of all, wait, you think I'm fucking bad? All my crazy shit comes from this one, okay. That is not true. All the penis jokes. I have been witness to that though Oh you do? - All the libido jokes. - Wait! - Her fault. - I'm old now, you can't say that. Grab your ass and your boobs? Her fault! Like, foot fetish? Her fault. Wait a minute, wait a minute. So I always did my toe nails and- - She has beautiful feet. - Nice feet, Can I see them? And then, no, not now - No, I didn't do my toes. - But anyway... I refuse to show my feet, today. She crippled me for life, like ergh. Oh, and when you watched TV, I used to rub you with my foot, right? - It was over. - On the floor? She used to molest me. No, I didn't! - I was in heaven - Oh my God! I was in molested heaven. Oh my God, that's not true. It was the good kind of molestation, it wasn't the bad kind. Oh my god, I'm not even gonna, I'm out of this. He's telling me. Bye aunt Ro. The moment I found out that Mina wanted to be addressed as Mina, we were in my car heading to rehearsal to a Life of Agony rehearsal. I remember her looking over to me saying, "I officially changed my name." "I have a new birth certificate, I'm now Mina Caputo." I knew that there was no more, "Hey Keith," you know, that was it. That's Mina, you know, she's Mina now. Make sure you edit all the he's that my Aunt spits out. I know, I know, I said. She was really good before- - I said, I said that you're gonna get mad at me. I don't get mad, but it's just annoying. I know, I know that, I know that. What do you know, with your red frames? That a lot of... With my red frames? Yeah. I miss my cousin, you know what I mean? I feel like the changes separated her from the family, which it didn't have to. That's on her part, not our part because we accept her 100%. I don't really like policing people anyway. You just did, you policed me because you heard me saying in the background. Yeah, 'cause I had to let the creepers know. They know, he knows, I told him. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, I'm both and neither. I'm confused, I'm confused more than you are, so it's like... No, you're not. Yeah. A big part of your life to me, you were a he, so there's a big transition there in my demented head that you're a her, but I accept you and I love you so much and that doesn't take away from how I feel about you. So if I make a mistake, that means I'm 68 years old and I'm screwed up. You know what I think? I think if I spent more time with you. I think I'm really confused. You know what I think? I think if I spent more time with you, I would say him less. I love Mina's soul, I love what she stands for. At that rehearsal Mina didn't come in and say, "Hey, everyone I'm Mina," or anything like that. Alan, I think found out in a unique way. How did I hear that she came out? I was on the side of the stage waiting to go perform with her in Europe. I think it was the last show of a European tour and the promoter, who was going to introduce the band, comes over to me and says, "Should I say, 'This is your last show ever?'" "And why would you do that?" "Because, oh you didn't know?" "I didn't know what?" He showed me his phone and apparently on all the metal news sites, the news had broke that Mina had come out and we were on tour together for two weeks. I mean, our bunks are feet away from each other, never one conversation about it. When I was on Facebook years ago, I started trickling more of my feminine self. And the more I did it, the more hate I got. And one day it just got to a point where some kid said some really nasty things to me. And that's when I basically outed myself online. "Like, you know, I'm transsexual," completely proud of it. "You could all go fuck yourselves." I was ready to give up my musical career. I was ready to give up my family, all of my friends. We played the show. I was just trying to piece it all together and like certain things that maybe I sensed along the way were making sense. And so when we got off stage, I asked to talk to her alone on the bus. It wasn't easy to tell mates of yours that, yeah, I'm going full on, mother fucker, you know. I'm letting her out. That's it, "I can't take it anymore." It's either I put a bullet in my head or... because I can't live another day "the way they want me to." My first reaction was, I was hurt that after all these years and everything that we've gone through, that I had to find out that way that she wouldn't... Why wouldn't she feel comfortable enough to talk to me about it? For the people who don't go through what we go through, they can't even imagine the discomfort at the time, the pain, the fear. "I was afraid of what you might say." I said, "Why, when have I ever judged you?" I got to tell her, honestly, that I wish I knew before. We got over that at that moment. Al like, you know, we come from very different blood lines, but like that's family Alan's like real family. I have people in my own bloodline that haven't shown me a cell of unconditional love the way my boys and girls do now. When she came out, first of all, we didn't know if the band was gonna continue or if it could continue, but at least I knew that she was happy. It was more scary, the first few years, than it was empowering. Now I'm feeling that empowerment because I have the courage to be hated and disliked. What is your fucking story tonight? I don't fear someone else's mindless opinion of how I'm living my life. Just stop looking at me like I'm a freak because I'm gonna take my tits out and put 'em in your face. I think the best thing to do for the people who are being attacked by this type of personality is to ignore it. Because as time goes on, these people are gonna disappear, you wanna know why? Because like everything else on the earth, things evolve. I tell Mina all the time, just don't listen. It doesn't matter, their voices don't even matter. I didn't let it bother me, but she was just looking at me all night long. Like I'm like, what is your story, what do you want? Why are you staring at me all night long? If you don't like me, fuck off, don't ruin my fucking night. There's a lot of people that will never get it. We really didn't think that the band was going to continue. I think I got a call from our booking agent who said that there was an offer for us to play in Belgium and just started calling around to everybody and seeing if everyone was game, everyone was on board. No one knew how it was gonna go. We put our hearts on our sleeve and we said, "This is our friend, this is what she chose to do and no matter what happens, we're doing it together." In that live moment, that hour and change, I felt like I understood the songs more than I ever did in my life. It was such a wave of emotions and the crowd was so receptive to that energy. It was a fantastic show and it gave us hope that, wow, we can still do this. Mina came out of her shell. Here's this incredible front person, here is someone that wants to be there. I never saw her like that before. And from that point on, I've been going up and up and up and up and up. I won't have it any other way. It's great, it's great to see, not just as a band mate, but as a friend. Regardless of what I went through with my grandfather, really doesn't matter to me now. He did the best with what he knew. There was a lot of forgiveness, there was a lot of love there before he actually left the planet. If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger and Mina is a strong human. Seeing Mina happy is beautiful. I mean, now she's who she is, you know, and it's awesome. There's a lot of people that are in similar situations that I would think that she gives hope to, you know. And now they're back together as a fucking bad-ass band. What more do you want than that? And it's hard to be like truly, you know, innately, you know, rock and roll, you know, rock and roll has been pretty much played out. And so where are the edges? Where are the boundaries? And these are some boundaries and they're beautiful boundaries and they need to be pushed. So, you know, kudos to those guys, they rule. I can't imagine that being an easy thing, especially in that genre of music, you don't see that happening a lot. You know, I really got to give her credit for that. We always had drummer problems from day one. I think we went through like 10, 11 drummers. We finally found the ideal, it's like, she fits like a glove. Hey Veronica, this is Joey. Welcome to the fucking family. We don't even want to look at anyone else, we love you. You were our one and only choice. Mina, Joe, and Alan, I could just see it in them. They'll do this to the day they drop dead and I will too, I will too, I'm right there with them. We've accomplished so much in one year, it's unbelievable. And the vibe and the love, the unconditional love for one another, for the music, for the creative process, for everything that we're doing together, it's almost like we will make he myths together now, as a band, like the way The Doors was, all for one and one for all. When we set out to create "Sound of Scars", we really wanted to get back to the feeling of what inspired us in the first place. This is us now, this is the music we wanna play. These are the stories we wanna tell. ♪ Lay down, lay down ♪ Lay down and die ♪ Won't lay down, lay down ♪ Lay down and die The music we create is like the ayahuasca vine in a sense, you know, it allows you to confront demons. I'm so sorry about your buddy man. So sorry about the pain. Hey, this band saved my life; sober 14 years, 14 years. This album is not about giving up on life, it's about fighting for it. You've always been that band that when I've gone through the relationship break up, the friend's suicide, the job loss, all that fucking stuff that's on "River Runs Red". We're still here because of how it resonated and because it saved so many lives and continues to help people who are struggling. That's what keeps us doing it, that's what keeps us tied to our fan base. I'm hoping that we can do this for as long as we possibly can. My life is not sad now. I'm very happy to have my life, but we are here, always... Always. - Okay, uh-uh. - Oh. Always for me, all you do for me during times and times and times, sister of me. It's more than just friends, it's more than just being in a band, it's lives. Our lives are intertwined and I think we all realize that what we've done together is bigger and almost more important than anything we've done separately. These get togethers are more important than we realize. This is about our family, the LOA family. I would have never thought like, even like today would happen. I can't believe we've arrived at this point. It's pretty fucking mind-blowing to me. Sometimes I get a call from Joey and his name comes up on my phone and it just dawns on me like, we've been talking to each other more or less about this band for 30 years. Hearing my cousin Mina sing those words, stories about our lives, stories about what we went through. It's been about connecting with people. It's been about reaching out. That's the reward, I mean, that connection is what Life of Agony is all about and has been about since day one. We have big dreams, very big fucking dreams, and they'll all be met in due time.
