Shai Scherf, getting ready. Alon, smile for the camera. Organized briefing... Lower the tent flaps. Today I'll teach you to get the ball into the basket. Foul! Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Let's go. I'm the villain, Leoni Paamoni! I... Look at this. -I want to say... -Yes, Noam what? Shai, I love you. -I love you too. -You mean a lot to me... Nitz, open here. -Don't hide the beauty. Take your glasses off, we're inside. -Hey... How will I impress the babes? -Danny... Alon! Alon! Stop filming. -Shai... -Lets go! Oh, Alon... "We commit his soul..." Let's go, it's flashing. -Are you recording? To Alon. -To Alon. Cheers. I heard... that the official cause of death was canned beef. He cooked a mean one. Stir fried canned beef. -Canned beef in red wine. Canned beef and kabanos. -And his top dish, canned beef with tuna. I can't believe he's not here. I keep looking at the door, waiting for him to walk in. Okay, another round. -No, no, no, no... Enough. One more. -Not for me. One more? -Let's do it. Thank you. -Hagit. -Hagit! -Thank you, Hagit. Another day like this at work and I'm joining Alon. Black Humor already? What? what? Why don't you just quit your job? I like my job. Oh yeah? You don't stop bitchin' about it. That's part of the job, isn't it? -Avivi, go make your dreams come true. You're such a child. Here he goes again. -You showed it to me two days ago, man. Check it out... -Here we go. -Look at the prince. Well, how about it? Where's Avivi? What, bro? -Where's Avivi? I thought he was with you. -Maybe he's in the bathroom. Avivi! Avivi. Let's go, Avivi, I'll take you home. Get up. Stop filming. -It's for the baby. I'm off, hope I don't see you when I get back. Bye. What is it, bro? -I have this weird thing with my skin. I can't get rid of it. Alon had it too when he was in hospital. Just making sure it's not dangerous or something. Does Michal know you're here? -No, and you're not telling her. Come in. -Hello. He told me to check if there's something in both our histories. What history? Okay. "Anthrax" Click images. Whoa. Yuck. Oh God... -Fuck! Look at that. Let's think about this a second, okay? Let's be reasonable. -What's there to think about? Alon died at 26, Avivi has had this rash for two months now, now Noam's dying. And guess what? we all took part in the anthrax experiment. That doesn't mean anything. The doctor said that maybe I got it on my trip to Asia, it's not... -You see, the army doesn't do whatever the hell it wants. -Come on, the IDF covers up anything that doesn't suit it. -Oh come on, bro. What's with all the conspiracies? You a leftist now? Is it your promotion? You afraid of losing it? What's my promotion got to do with it? -Then what? I'm just saying that this is the IDF. It's a serious accusation, bro. We're not accusing anyone. We just want to find out. Sounds reasonable to me. Hit me again... and I'll break the pen on your head. We weren't the only team that did the experiment, so if it were true, we would have heard about it. -How exactly? I think it's a huge screw up that they're trying to hide. -Whatever. Let's just hope we're wrong, I don't feel like dying before the Champions League Final. Who said anything about dying, you asshole? We just have some questions for the medical corps. Is the experiment administration even open? Shai, can you do me a favor? Don't make any problems. We report the symptoms, ask if there's a connection and that's it. No fucking around. Are you insinuating that I'm a trouble maker? I'm insinuating that we're not accusing anyone yet. Well, I'm shooting everything with a hidden camera, so act natural. You're not serious. -Is that even legal, bro? Really? -Trust me. What is that? It's the camera? Where is it? Right here. -Where will you put it? -In my shirt pocket. The story of five soldiers... who fought against all odds. This summer... No one is immune. "Anthrax" Directed by Shai Scherf. -Close the window. Asking if there's a connection between your symptoms, your friend's death, and the experiment you took part in, is a grave accusation. -No, wait... Are you sure you want to go there? -No, no, hold on. No one is making any accusations, we just want to find out... You volunteered for this experiment. And may I remind you, you signed a confidentiality agreement. Do you need a reminder? -No, there's no need. I can show you the document you signed. -No, wait. We have all the files... -Just listen for a second. When we got the vaccination you said we should come to you if we have a problem. Guys... -Now we have a problem, so we're coming to you. -Guys, guys, the experiment administration is closed because it was no longer necessary, the experiment is over. -Then reopen it, it's necessary now. Can we please see our personal files? You said you have them, right? We want to take a look at them. -What for? -We have to take a look, okay? I want to hang mine on the wall, how do we get a hold of them? You can't! You're putting me in an uncomfortable situation. I really want to help you. -We get that. -You know how the system works. We wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable, god forbid... Let's go. -Thank you. The exit is here. -I'll be right there. Hey, where are you going? -I'm sorry. Did you find anything, Shai? -No, someone stopped me before I could get in. Okay... -Wait, hold on. What? Avivi? What's going on? -What's the matter, bro? You alright? -"You volunteered for your country." "You volunteered for your country." Yeah, right? That dude was real nice. What do we do? We didn't get any answers. -Let's go. Come on. Damn... Hi. -License and registration please. Is there a problem? Okay. Here. Everyone's so nice to us today... Why us of all people? He has all day, huh? Is everything in order? -Go, have a nice day. Thank you. I have it too, but it's not that bad, I didn't think anything of it. I'll be honest with you. I don't think there's a connection between the vaccine, your friend's death and your symptoms. The experiment was top secret, they brought their own people. They'd come and go after each round of injections. We were just... We just implemented it. -Side effects? Has anyone complained of any symptoms? Not to me. But the experiment took place in several bases... A doctor from another clinic told me that two soldiers felt ill and were removed. Hold on, is that unusual? No, it makes sense. Just before our last leave, my platoon was taken to the operations room, they closed the door, took our cell phones and had us sign a secrecy agreement before they even said a word. They said that in the next war, most casualties will result from biological warfare. How can you say no? I had four injections out of seven. Why only four? I got severe stomach pains. I didn't feel well after the third injection. Nausea, headaches, I felt horrible. I was immediately sent to the experiment administration. Why were you removed from the experiment? They said they didn't want to take the risk of making things worse. The doctor said it had nothing to do with the vaccination, but... he took me out of the experiment. Do you remember if he was a soldier? No, no. What his name was? Where he was from? I don't really remember, but... I remember he said he worked for the Institute of Biological Research. Excuse me, how do we get in? What do you need? -We need to talk to one of the doctors or maybe a spokesperson. -Can you come over here please? You can't be here! It's off limits. -We just have some questions, we need to get in. -No visitors allowed. Wait a minute. We can get authorization. -Move along. What's your problem? We just have some questions. Motherfucker. -What did you expect? l think we should do something for Alon, a get together on the roof, Like nothing too big, something intimate. -Yeah. Just us and some of his friends. I think... You know, maybe on a Saturday afternoon. Should we invite Dudi? -Of course. I didn't mean a private event, just not, you know, we're not ging to invite... Mika from the 3rd grade... Maybe some of his friends from work. Bro, I think we're being followed. Who? That jeep? -Yes. -Dude, everyone has a jeep in north Tel Aviv... He's not following us. -I'm telling you, he is. Shai, take a left. -Here... Is he still there? -Yeah. -Take a side street. He's gone. Shai, stop freaking us out. James! I can... It's like, you know... -What, Noam? -Facebook... Let's say... Can I see a friend of yours who's not a friend of mine? Guys, I have a story, so before I forget... What a woman... Don't film this! I'm hot. Danny.. Noam! -Danny... Danny, Danny... What's your deal? Tell me once and for all what you're doing with that camera, I don't get it... You buy stuff from A to L and he buys from L onwards, right? So you were arguing over whether it's chicken or wings? Shelly, what are you doing? I dunno. -You're not fishing. Have you ever seen anything like this? Huh, bro? Cheers. -The barbeque is about to fall. Avivi! Avivi! Hey! Avivi! What happened? Avivi! -Avivi! Avivi! Is he alright? -Give him some air. Water. -Hold on, Danny... He collapsed like a sack of potatoes, -Babe, pick up his legs. Hey! How did he fall? - What does it matter? We were talking and he just collapsed. Let's get him out of here. Let's go, Shai. -Be careful... Drop the damn camera, give us a hand! Wait, I'm holding him. -One, two, three and... up. Shai... -Get that thing out of my face. He's okay, he's feeling better. He needs a few more tests, I got him a private room. Thanks. We're here, we'll take shifts if we have to. Yeah. Knock knock. There he is. -How's it going? Making trouble again? -You don't look so good. -No, I'm okay. I'm already joking around with my doctors. Where's Shelly? -She went home to rest. I'll stay with you today, if that's okay. -Of course it's okay honey. -Yeah? -Yeah. Why are you surprised? I always was a die hard soldier. How do you feel, Yotam? -Yotam... -What? Did I say something wrong? -It must be really bad if she's calling me Yotam. I'm fine, can I go home? No, I'm afraid not. Could you please leave the room? Sure. -Wait, no... They can hear anything you have to say. Okay. We suspect that you have Vasculitis, it's an infection of the blood vessels. It's an autoimmune disease where the body attacks itself. And it's... Is it serious? -It's not good, but we don't know what the risks are yet. Shelly will kill me. Here's your water. -Thank you. Are you ready? I have to draw blood. Please... Put your arm here. I didn't even know there was an anthrax experiment. No one did. It was top secret, we're violating confidentiality. What hospital was Alon in? I'll get his medical records. Rambam Hospital, right? -Yes. We went to the experiment administration, to the Biological Institute, they were real jerks, barely let us in. That's sterile, right, Tamar? -Of course. I'll see what I can do. -Everything's sterile and disposable. Okay? -Excellent, thanks. You know about the Kishon River incident and the Navy Commandos? Of course. I knew one of the divers, he was from my kibbutz. The soldiers lost the lawsuit. Wow. -Hold this here. Hold on, I'll tape it down. Did they file an appeal? They don't have the strength anymore. It wore them down. They're not doing so well. Have some water. -Drink up, bro. Do you have to be tested too? Yes. We need your arm. I signed a confidentiality agreement, I couldn't tell. You couldn't tell me? We're going to have a child and you stay faithful to the army instead of your family? You're pregnant babe, I didn't want to freak you out. Really, I... -Well you did an amazing job. I don't give a rat's ass about the army or keeping its secrets, you should be thinking about your family. -That's what I'm trying to do. Noam, they put something inside your body. That's why Avivi is in hospital. How could you keep that from me? Hey, hey, where are you going? -Stop. -What? Where? I don't know. -I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, babe. -Noam, let go of me, I need some space. I made a few phone calls, including the Biological Institute. They didn't tell me much because I don't have security clearance, so I got one of the doctors here to use his connections. They told me to apply for security clearance. I did, but it could take months. You won't get it. Okay, now I know why red tape kills. Okay, so... what do we do? In order to confirm or rule out the vaccine, we must know the components. If you have other ways, I suggest you check them out. Okay? -Yes, thank you. Bye. Well? -What do you say? Are you guys insane? -What? Do you have a better idea? No, but I don't think that breaking in is such a good idea. -Listen... You heard what Shai said, right? The answers are in the archives of the experiment administration. Noam, leave it, it's a bad idea. Then let's go to the media and blow this thing wide open. That's even worse, Shai. -Yeah, what will we say? We don't know if it's true or not. You still have doubts? We have doubts because we're reasonable people. We have to find out what's in the vaccine, right? The experiment administration has the answers. Let's do this. There are other ways. -Danny, I don't get you. Avivi's very sick, what are you waiting for? For the IDF to wake up? You think the IDF cares about a lowly soldier? Yes, I'd like to think so. -So you care more about the army. You think I care more about the army than Avivi? You wanna break in so you can get some awesome footage. I'm not a coward like you. -What's with you guys? How is this helping Avivi? He's way out of line, I care more about the army than Avivi? Go do your break in, you moron. -Danny, Danny... -I've had it! What's with you? Stop it already! You went too far. I can't wrap my head around this. Noam really fucked me up for filming you at the hospital. I nearly fucked him up. Yeah, and you just stood there with your camera like a complete idiot. I don't know what was in that vaccine, I... I'm afraid for our child, I'm afraid something's wrong with our child. How could he keep this from me? Listen, I think that we only just realized what this whole thing means. -And when he told me, my reaction sucked. I mean, I apologized afterwards, but... I just want this to be over. Me. Your turn? I threw down your Ace, kiddo. -The Ace? Go. -Now Avivi? -Now Avivi. Wow! -Nice. No fever. That's a good sign, right? -That's an excellent sign. I'll change your IV and get out of your way. But it was changed like 2 hours ago. Wasn't it? -Who changed it? I don't know, a nurse, I don't know her. -"I don't know her" yeah, right. You must be confused, the bag's empty, it's from this morning. -It's empty. -It's some good shit, huh, babe? Could be. What about the blood tests? Did they come out okay? They were okay, I mean... -Sorry. Just a little deviation, I'll get tested again, it'll be fine. Are you going to the doctor tomorrow? Yes... Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! -Avivi! -Yotam! You must leave now! Leave now! -Do something! Yotam! Leave, you can't be here. -Shai! But why is he seizing? Yotam! Let's wait outside, you don't have to see this! -I want to go in! He's in good hands. Dr. Yanir is one of the best in the country. Let's move away, Danny. Just a second, bro. Okay, we put him to sleep so he'd stop seizing. You can come in now. Don't you find the whole IV thing strange? Maybe someone injected... Shai, give it a rest already! Babe, are you ready? Noam, don't worry. I'm the perfect cover, a pregnant nurse. Thanks, Michali. Okay, let's get this over with. Good luck. Hello. I'm here to see the person in charge of experiments. So call him now before... before I press all these buttons! Get him on the phone! You stay out of this! Get your hand off me! Who do you think you are? I want... How come you do cannabis experiments without including me? Hah? You experiment with cannabis, you put soda in the water... Get your hand off me! I'm not your friend! I want to understand... I want to talk to that commander! Stay away! I'm sick! Can't you see? What's with you? Go to your commander... I want to understand... I won't submit... Can I talk now? An application, are you insane? I want to do the cannabis experiment! I want to do the cannabis experiment too! Fine... Don't do me any favors! People, don't enlist! Unless you wanna grow a tail. Go, go, go. I can't believe it worked. -Did you get it? I found the files but they were empty. I checked human resources, I found this dismissal letter for a doctor Avigdor Katz. -Good! He worked at the Biological Institute. -So he's our man, we have to talk to him. Way to go, guys! Listen, I'm putting the camera in the front of the bag. Make sure Dr. Katz is in front of it at all times. -Okay. Pictures of Avivi. The anthrax vaccine components? -Yes, the one you gave us. Anthrax? -I know you were part of the experiment. I was at the experiment administration, I saw your dismissal letter. You didn't do a good enough job poisoning us so they let you go, huh? Poisoning you? There was an imminent threat to the country. We did what we had to do. You were IDF soldiers and that's exactly what soldiers are supposed... This is what your vaccination did to us, take a good look. Is this how you look out for the citizens of your country? Like this? Like this? My friend is dead, okay? Because of this shit. I have another friend in hospital, he's... I don't know, he needs something. Tell me what the components are and we'll be done with this. I'm sorry about your friends but I don't think it's because of the experiment. If you don't tell me, I'll blow this story wide open in the media. Only one doctor will be named. Want to guess who that is? Tomorrow evening. -Okay. Hey! Did you call the cops? -No, I came right here. What about the footage? -I have backups, don't worry. I got this by email 2 hours ago. It's the experiment administration. I don't believe this. How did they find out? -Who's "they?" What do we do? -What do we do? We drop the whole thing. Oh yeah? What about Avivi? You want him to end up like Alon? Of course not, but we don't know who these people are, this is getting dangerous, don't you think? Who's that? -Danny. I came as soon as I saw the message. -How's it going? Hi. You alright? -Yeah, it's just... some issues with the army, that's all. -Is it serious? My promotion got canceled... I'm leaving at the end of the month. You can congratulate me. -I don't believe you, bro. Those bastards. -Did they say why? No openings or something. Danny, this is no coincidence. -Come on, Shai. Bro, they're getting back at him. Just like they broke into my apartment and sent Michal the video. What video? -And I'm telling you that whole thing with the IV is fishy too. Shai, that doesn't make sense. Nurses often forget to record an IV. He's right. I... I used my connections with the medical corps, I asked for their help and I told them about the... I told them everything. What did you say? -I didn't mention names, I didn't mention you, but... I said I was part of an experiment, that Avivi is sick, that I need the medical records to help him. They said they'd get back to me, killed my promotion and vanished. You totally screwed us, you know that? That's why the files were empty, they knew we were coming. You're right, bro. I screwed you and I screwed Avivi. -Not necessarily, Danny. It doesn't explain the break in, how did they know Shai was filming? Unless you said something. -No way. -Bro, she's right. We did make some noise at the administration. Maybe that idiot officer hid the files. He still went behind our backs and that stinks. -Whatever, this isn't all about Danny. We get this video the exact same day that you had a break in? Listen, guys, they stepped up their game, now they're threatening us. But if it's not because of Danny, who can it be? You can't go in! What are you doing here? I'm with a patient... Whoa, whoa, Danny! Danny! -Son of a bitch! You make me think you have a conscience and then you send people to threaten us? You think we're gonna let this go? What... What are you talking about? I didn't mention our meeting to anyone. Why should we believe you? -Because I'm breaking the law for you, that's why. Get the hell out of here, and don't come back! Come on, let's go. Sorry, Doctor. Is that it? -Sure is. I'm calling Shelly. What the hell? Danny! Danny! Shai! -Put that down! Run! Run! Shit! Shai... Mother fucker! Are you okay, bro? They're still here. -Then get outta there. Danny! Shai, Shai, be careful. Who is that mother fucker? You got his plate number, right? Let's go, bro. I'm dying here. What? You having trouble breathing? -No, I'm fine. -What's wrong? My stomach hurts. -This side? Did you get hurt? -No, my stomach hurts, inside. Did you get a look at the guy? -I don't know, I'll go over the footage tonight. Maybe the camera picked something up. -I see. -Yeah. There he is! -Hey! Get over here, don't be shy. -Come here. Let's see that new nose of yours. Who called the monkey? How's it going, Michali? How are you, bro? As good as new. What's this? You and Avivi having a slumber party? Can we come too? If you knew how to run, honey, this wouldn't have happened. So, someone tried to run us over. -You have to go to the police. What will we say? That we broke into the experiment administration? That we think a top secret experiment is killing us? -Yes, that's exactly what you should say. How's he doing? They want to wake him up, but they haven't decided when. You're coming? How are you? Better than Avivi. Remember how he tried to get into shape after the wedding? He wanted to do the Jerusalem marathon. And then 2 kilometers into it he threw up. We laughed at him that he was getting old, that he'll never be in shape again. It was probably this thing, right? We'll call you when we know more. What... What about the components? Any news? I hope it's just a matter of days. -Great. We approached a few more experts, we're waiting for answers. What's wrong? Nothing, I... Hey, Avivi will be fine. You know him, it's Avivi we're talking about. I can't wait for Michal to have the baby. I just want to make sure he's okay. And I'm dying to talk to her about it, but I just can't. I don't want to stress her out while she's pregnant. Man, I'm so exhausted. I'm here for you, you know that right? -I know, man. Honey. -How are you? -Fine. I'm fine. -I so sorry that I can't come with you, and I don't understand how they discharged you. Maybe I'll go talk to her. -No, she said I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Absolutely. Listen, I'm going home, I'll wait for you in bed, naked. Alright? -I'll be home at 03:3. I'll be home early. Great. We'll watch "Grey's Anatomy?" You really are okay. -I am, only if you want to. Okay. You sure? -Absolutely. -Okay. Love you. -Me too. See you soon? -Yes. Go. Sorry. -Wait, sorry. I didn't mean it -It's not a pillow. Bye. -Bye. Dude, I stink so bad. -But you're out, bro. Where's the car? -At the end. Listen, Noam, it's time to go public. -Go public? Take this whole thing to the media. -Enough, Shai, it's over, man. We're done. Listen, I posted some messages on a bunch of forums, you have no idea how many people took part in this experiment. This experiment is bigger than we thought. Do they have side effects? -Some of them do. Okay, so now they'll get a cure, thanks to you. And what about the ones we didn't reach through the forums? Don't they deserve to know that they're sick because of the experiment? Noam, the minute we go public with this, no one will be able to stop us. Where's the Noam that I know? The Noam who can't sleep at night when he knows someone is suffering? You didn't just say that. That's totally fucked up. What's it got to do with anything? I don't get you, bro. -What? -I don't get you. What? What do you want us to do? -So you wanna say nothing? Let's blow this wide open! People need to know! It'll get out... -I don't want to. -It'll spread like wild fire, it won't be up to us anymore. -I can't deal with it. What do you want me to do? I have Michal, I'm going to be a father, what do you want me to do? I just can't. So we should keep our mouths shut. Huh? Open the car. -You wanna shy away from the responsibility? That's exactly what they did. Noam, look at the camera. Look into the camera. I want you to tell all those people that you're a selfish son of a bitch who only cares about himself and his family, no one else. Say it. Say it. What? -Hold on. -Don't go in there, okay? Sit down. What are we doing? Hold on. Why are you filming? -I want to capture your reaction on film. Sit down. Our reaction to what? Voila. Dude... Nice one. -Amazing. Dude... Congrats. Nice. -So? Good job. "S. a combat fighter" - yeah, right. Here you go, a gift for your military discharge. Nice of you. See, we each have our thing. I mean... Avivi is into computers, Noam is into education, you got your movies... and I have the army, you know? I had the army. I was good at it, I believed in it, I... And then they try to run you over. How long before it was taken down? -3 hours. I called the reporter, he didn't want to talk, he was so stressed out. -Loser. Fuck them all. We're gonna demonstrate. It's our democratic right. -Noam, you just got out of hospital. No other choice, people have to know. You think you'll protest and get away with it? Haven't you been through enough? -Yes, but the others need to know. Why can't you just take the treatment? -It doesn't work that way. We have a responsibility. -Shai, I don't care, why do you have to be the face of this battle? Since when are you the face of all this? -Hey, hey... Michali, we're in this together. -No we're not in it together. So far Noam's the only one who was in hospital. -And Avivi. Noam's going to be a father! -Michal, stop. No. I'm sick and tired of being nice, promise me you won't do it. Michal... -I won't promise you that. You expect them to fight for my health while I sit back and do nothing? It's not that. -Yes it is. -No, it's not. -Michal, with all due respect we're in this together. -Shai, Shai, hold on. Hold on a second. Thank you. If it was me in the hospital and not Avivi, would we wait? I can't, I'm sorry. That's not who I am. That's not who you are? I'm asking you to be with me. Michal, we have to do this. Shai, please get the hell out of here. No more experiments! No more cover ups! No more vaccines! No more poison! Halutz, stop denying! Your soldiers are dying! Halutz, stop denying! Your soldiers are dying! Honor, Courage, Commitment. Anthrax! Halutz, stop denying! Your soldiers are dying! No more vaccines! No more poison! -Whoa! Police! Are you in charge of this demonstration? -Yes, what's the problem? You're disrupting public order. Please vacate the site. -We're less than 50 people, we haven't even started. -I don't care, 5 minutes and you're out of here. -Or what? You don't want to know. No more experiments! No more cover ups! No more experiments! No more cover ups! Son of a bitch! Fuck! Move! Get the camera outta my face! What do you think you're doing? You can't do this. This is unbelievable. How is he? The same. What does Dr. Yanir say? I haven't seen her in a few days. What about the others? Danny's still being detained. His lawyer says... he got most of the charges dropped, except the confidentiality violation. And Noam? I talked to him this morning, he said he may come by this afternoon. He hasn't been feeling so well lately. Hey, monkey. How's it going? -How are you? What's up? -It's all good. -Whoa, what's this? Nothing serious. -How's it going, bro? You doing okay? -When did you get out? Early this morning. What will they say? -I have no idea. I tried to get some information from the girl that called, but... she wasn't in the mood for sharing. -They won't say a thing. I wonder what they want. We've decided to take full responsibility. Thank you. So, the vaccine was defective. We'll look into your claims, Mr. Avivi will be transferred to our care if need be. You too, of course. When? My husband's not doing well. Once you sign, we'll speed up the process. Okay, what's wrong with us? What did you inject us with? We'll provide you with the finest care. We have the means. Our friend is dead, don't you think we deserve a better answer? I'm sorry about your friend, but there's no proof he died because of the vaccine. You call that taking responsibility? -We're not denying the experiment. If there are side effects, we'll take care of that. Guys, they're shutting us up. -What about our families? I'm going to be a father, I want to know that you'll look out for our families too. -Noam, Noam, Noam. -What? You're not thinking of cooperating with them. -The IDF takes full responsibility. What about the guys who aren't here? The ones who don't know about this meeting? We'll inform whoever needs to know. -All you have to do is sign this document that sums up what we said and a confidentiality agreement regarding the experiment because it's a matter of national security. Danny, we're prepared to drop the charges against you. Oh yeah? Thank you... Take a few minutes to think about it. Okay, obviously we're not going... -Hold on a sec. This whole thing sounds fishy to me. -Yeah, I don't like their answers either. What do you think? -I don't think we have a choice. We have to sign. They're the only ones who can help Avivi. -And keep it to ourselves? Shelly, you said it's the right thing to do. -They said they'll inform whoever has to know. This is what we wanted, for people to know and for Avivi to get treatment. Oh yeah? Doesn't it seem weird to you that they called us? We raised hell, it worked. It was the right thing to do at the time. We did enough, it's time to take care of ourselves. -What work exactly, Shelly? They're not telling us the truth, they're hiding something from us. Shai, we're not abandoning Avivi. I want to sign. Yotam Avivi. Noam Kaplan. Thank you. Danny Klein. What's your name? Shai Scherf. No, you're not on the list. Check again. Maybe it's at the bottom of the pile. You're not on the participant list. I told my mom about the experiment. She's a microbiologist, she knows about this stuff, I... She told me that... it's dangerous and I shouldn't do it. When were you gonna tell your best friends that you're not going to participate after your mom warned you? -I couldn't tell you, I... I was afraid, you know, the confidentiality thing. -Whoa... The confidentiality thing? You didn't tell us because of the confidentiality thing? But I told you it's dangerous, I tried to tell you, I couldn't know... -You tried to tell us? When did you try? When did you say anything in these past 2 months? How could I know it would end this way, Noam?! -Calm down. He's a selfish liar. -Stop it. Noam, I... -He lied to me, he lied to you, Avivi's in hospital... Why didn't you say anything? -Noam, you're wrong... -I'm not wrong! I made a mistake, I know. But I'm just as involved in this as you are, I'm the one filming it all so that everyone knows. Screw you're filming! I've had it! Noam... -The only thing you care about is filming! Enough already! -Noam, stop. -Avivi's on a ventilator, how can you lie to us? How? What? -You're right. Noam, I demonstrated with you. I was at the experiment administration with you. I'm as involved in this as you are. -Good for you. it's just that we have this shit in our bodies and you don't. Noam... Danny... Danny? When we began participating in military operations in Lebanon, the only thing I was afraid of was losing them. I never had such good friends. So I started filming, all the time. The salami goes in here, the cheese over here. Avivi hated it, he kept complaining, he kept saying it's bad luck. Give back the kitbag. -Ole! Back to being a civilian -Ole! I want to be a civilian I want to be a civilian To get stoned in the far east... It's open! Hi, Shai. How's it going? Fine. What are you filming? Why are you filming us? -I need to talk to you, mummy. About what? -Let's sit down. -What's this about? I need to talk to you. -Okay, talk. Dad, can you turn it down? You want to go up... -Let's sit in the kitchen. What do you want to talk about? Dad! Turn down the TV please. It won't go off, Edna. -Why not? Mom... Yes? Remember when I was in the army they used us for that medical experiment? Yes. Yes? -Yes. No, not you, I didn't allow you to take part. Yes, but do you remember the story? -Of course I do. Well, I don't know what to do, I feel I betrayed my friends. Why? Because I didn't take the vaccine with them. What? You betrayed them? That's nonsense, Shai. It's not true. You didn't want to take part because I told you it's pointless, you didn't betray them. I don't agree with you at all. -I didn't tell them not to take part. They were convinced they should take part so they did. I should have told them... -But did you say, "I'm not doing it because...?" Did you explain why you're not taking part? No, I didn't. -What did you say? Nothing. How did you explain the fact that you're not taking part? Mom, I didn't say a thing, I... said nothing. The people who should feel bad are the ones who take advantage of youngsters and soldiers. Not you, Shai. Don't you feel bad. I don't see it as betrayal. I don't see it as betrayal. Look, maybe when I told you not to you took my word for it, but maybe you weren't totally convinced, so you made your own decision and you let the others make theirs. We fuckin' signed. He was supposed to be in their care, maybe we could have saved him. It's all my fault. I should have told you from the start. It's not your fault, Shai. You didn't vaccinate him. Hi, I'm Dr. Dotan, I work with Dr. Yanir. Where is she? She can't be here today, she's undergoing an investigation. What investigation? She's being investigated for malpractice. She's been suspended. When did this happen? -A few days ago. It's an old case, a matter of protocols. She did the right thing, but when a patient's family sues, the hospital prefers the doctor to go on leave. But is she okay? -She's fine. She... She's surprised because she was on good terms with the family and they weren't going to sue. Anyways, she told me to inform you of the research results. -Excellent. Look, I went over all the components and there's nothing in the vaccine that could have killed Yotam. What do you mean? -That's impossible. The vaccine has nothing to do with the side effects? Nothing in the components or their combination could have caused this. How can that be? -I don't know. You think Dr. Katz may have given us the wrong components? Maybe the vaccine's okay. How can that be? How? How did Avivi die? And why was the IDF so quick to take responsibility? I say they took responsibility because they're hiding something bigger. Someone is so fuckin' lying to us. We have to go see Katz, find out where he got the components and how they're not the reason. Let's bury Avivi first. So? Are you bummed out that you're the only one who got... the serious side effects? Look at your legs. -What's with all the questions? Yes, a little. I mean... it wouldn't have made it easier if we all got them, but... Tell me, do you love Noam? -What? -Do you love Noam? Very much. -Who do you love more, me or Noam? Don't do this to me. -Me or Noam? -Each in... I wanted to give you a fright. -Fuck you. -When's it my turn? He didn't hear. I made five confessions. Did you know he vomited in his mom's bag at the amusement park so no one would see? -For real? -Yes. -Yuck. Why yuck? Tomorrow the army calls you up and says: "Avivi, we need you for another experiment, it's a matter of national security." Would you sign up for it? -If I know there are no side effects? Yes, I think so. Someone has to do it. God, full of mercy give rest on the wings of the Divine Presence You think Dr. Katz bailed? Or that someone tried to shut him up. Hello, can I have the phone number of Dr. Avigdor Katz? Tel Aviv. Noam, get the address. -Great, can I have the address too? No answer. Okay, we have the address, it's nearby. Shai, wait here while we... What did he die of? -Don't you know? He killed himself. How do you know him? -We worked with him in the army. You? -From Jerom. I thought he only had a private clinic. -Yes. -What... What does Jerom do? -Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals? What's that all about? What is it, sweetie? What?! No, it's impossible. Honey... Honey, he's dead. We're at his house right now. Okay, okay. We're on our way, bye. -What did she say? What's this? -Dr. Katz left this for me at the nurses' station. Something about some research, I didn't quite understand. It looks like the list of the components. These are the components. But there's one that he crossed out. It wasn't like this when we got it. -I spoke to Dr. Yanir. She's waiting for you, this is her home address. You're a genius. Here, put this inside. Did he work at the Biological Institute during the experiment? Oh, I'm sorry, come sit down. He worked there until he was fired. Like you said, the first document is presumably the full list of components. The second is medical research. I think that Dr. Katz wanted to tell you that there's another component in the vaccine that he didn't disclose. And that component, when combined with one of the other components, creates the unwanted reaction. Dr. Katz hid a component from us. -He erased it. Maybe he didn't know the name of the component, maybe this is the only document he had. They conducted the experiment, and then they discovered this study and didn't tell us? They covered their asses? This study is from 1995. I think the Biological Institute knew about it before you were vaccinated. -No... They knew about it before? What I don't understand is why the components are printed on a page with the Jerom logo. Do you have a computer? Over there, on the table. -May I? -Go ahead. What are you doing, Noam? What are you looking for? I'm looking up Jerom. Say hello to Prof. Adi Cohen, CEO of Jerom. Where did he work during the experiment? -At the Biological Institute? From 1993 till 2001. I don't believe this. He's the asshole who did the experiment. He's responsible. What? You know he won't talk. We'll do what we have to do. -Fine, I'm not coming with you. Why not? Where are the documents? Here, but... I'm taking it to the chief medical officer. Why? Prof. Cohen is the address. -I know, but I have to know if the medical officer knew about this and authorized it. I have a responsibility towards the other soldiers too. Sorry. Do you have the other camera? Sure. Good luck, bro. -Thanks. Here it is. Let's do this, bro. Get in! Go, go, go. Fuck. Hello, I'm in your parking lot, someone just broke into your CEO's car, I've reached Jerom, right? Great, then maybe you should... Okay. Thanks, bye. Are you sure you can do this, bro? Don't worry. Here he is. Fuck! Get him inside! Go! Don't move! Do you know who we are? You poisoned our friends with a fucked up vaccine. I suggest you let me go. I suggest you give us the component. That's what I suggest. What's the missing component? What are you doing? I have no idea what you're talking about. Sit still! This will help you remember. What is that? -It's blood from one of your subjects, me. Now will you tell me what the missing component is? Dr. Katz gave you the components, I gave them to him in person. What else... -Don't bullshit me! We know the experiment was botched, we saw the study. Spill it! You know which study I mean. Huh? Why... Why did you vaccinate us if you knew something was wrong with the components? Give me the syringe. Alright... Alright. Alright. We didn't know this would happen. There was just this minor study. What was it? What was it? What was it? Stop, stop. -No! It was a measured risk. -A measured risk? Son of a bitch. The Americans said it was safe! What do the Americans have to do with this? We conducted the experiment for an American pharmaceutical company. Why didn't the Americans do it themselves? Answer him. The FDA wouldn't let them test the vaccine on human beings, they were stuck. So they came to me. Are you alright? -Is the camera rolling? Yes. -Yes? -Don't worry. Did they pay you for it? Did they pay you for it? Huh? Did they pay you for it? Did they pay you for it? Son of a bitch! How did it get approved here? In Israel no one argues with a security threat. Did you make up a security threat? -He didn't do this alone. The director of the Biological Institute doesn't make up a security threat on his own. He must have gotten help from high up. -How high up? How high up, huh? -Tell us! Get up! Get up. Get up, get up. Get up. -Come on. You used us for money, huh? For money? Huh? What does Jerom have to do with all this? Jerom is the subsidiary of the American pharmaceutical company. Oh, how convenient, and now you're the CEO. -Okay, forget that, I want to know what the component is and how it can be neutralized. It doesn't matter what the component is. I'm afraid the combination you were injected with, can't be neutralized. Stop. Hold on... Noam, no! Noam, no! Stop! Sure. Sure, no problem. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, I understand. We... we're on our way. Thank you. Noam, go to the news station, they're waiting for us. I don't think we'll make it. -You're finished, shut your mouth. Don't waste your breath. Noam! "Now it's official: The IDF conducted an anthrax experiment on soldiers." "The Ministry of Defense admits to conducting the anthrax experiment." "Grave mistakes made in the anthrax experiment the IDF conducted on its soldiers." "Investigation: Head of The Institute of Biological Research acted as consultant for companies developing anthrax vaccine." "The Anthrax Experiment: The state will grant soldiers thousands of shekels as compensation." My last night as a bachelor. It'll be nice to watch this when I'm 50... It'll be real nice. In 1999, the IDF conducted a medical experiment on 800 soldiers titled "Omer 2". Its objective: developing a vaccine against Anthrax. In 2007, the investigative TV series "Uvda" revealed that dozens of soldiers who participated in the experiment suffered from various illnesses. The IDF denied responsibility. An independent committee was formed to investigate whether parties of interest pressured decision makers. Some parties refused to testify. In 2008, the committee concluded that the experiment was mismanaged and that the use of soldiers was based on convenience and economic reasons, among others. In 2010, 29 experiment participants sued the state for damages. In 2014, they agreed to each receive tens of thousands of shekels as compensation. 12 Million shekels were assigned as a fund for all other participants. ANTHRAX
