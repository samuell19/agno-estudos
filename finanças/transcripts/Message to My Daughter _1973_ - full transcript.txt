(emotional music) (drowned out radio chatter) (tires screech) (loud crash) - Dad. Did I hurt anyone? - No. It's a miracle you didn't, though. Would you like to hear what you did do? You terrified an old man that you luckily missed by inches. You totaled your car by smashing into a pole. You lacerated your skull, and you got cuts and contusions over your entire body. - As long as they didn't hurt anyone. - Just yourself. Any idea what this is all about, Miranda? And what were you trying to prove? That you could kill yourself in blazing technicolor? - I don't have anything to say. - Neither do I. Now get some rest. I'll be back tonight. - How is she? - She's alive. - Was she drinking? - No. - Was she on drugs? - No, nothing. If she was, maybe I could make some sense of it. I don't know. You want to go in? - No, I think I'll wait 'til she comes home. - Well, let's go. ♪ When I was young, I'd listen to the radio ♪ ♪ Waiting for my favorite song ♪ ♪ When they played, I'd sing along ♪ ♪ It made me smile ♪ ♪ Those were such happy times ♪ - Good morning. ♪ Not so long ago ♪ ♪ How I wonder ♪ - Feel up to talking? ♪ Where they'd gone ♪ - Do you mind? ♪ But they're back again ♪ ♪ Just like ♪ - Well, I seem to have two choices. Stay out there and listen to Lorraine lecture me on how badly I've treated you, or come in here so that you and I could finally have this thing out in the open. Here I am. - Anything you say. - Well, I'm sorry for my behavior towards you of late. - That's okay. That's how you feel. - Oh, your landlady's been calling about the rent. Do you want me to pay for you? - I've been thinking about moving. But I don't know. - Well, why don't we stop beating around the bush, I'll just come right out and say it. I'm sorry. Obviously, I failed you very badly. I don't know how, I wish to God I did. - Forget it, okay? - Oh, sure. Forget it just like that? And write off what you did to yourself, young lady, just like that. You might've died in that accident, you know! - And if I did, what difference would it make? - Stop it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself! I can't stand it when people wallow in self pity! What is it with you? Is it a boy? Well, something must be the matter! Why won't you let me get in touch with you? - We've never been in touch, or haven't you noticed? - Well, I'm not going to apologize for all the time I couldn't spend with you. I raised you the best way I knew how. - It's not you. It's... Lousy world out there. - 19 years of age, and she's already judged the world. - Yes, I've judged it. There's nothing in it for me, it's meaningless, cruel, stupid. I don't want any part of it. - Darling, I don't know what you're talking about! (laughs) - I didn't think you did. - I mean, what does all there out there got to do with you? You can't change the world, Miranda! - No, you're right, I can't. - Your mother wanted you to have these. And she told me to pick the time to give them to you. I guess now is the right time. (mysterious music) - Darling, Miranda. This is your mother speaking to you. Yes, really. Your mother. Today is June 12th, 1956. I'm 21 years old, and I'm going to die. I'm making these tapes for you because it'll be the only way you're ever gonna get to know me. It's funny, I'm sitting here talking into this machine, and you're right here next to me. You only just started walking. You're still in diapers. I just need to talk to you. I need to find a way to be close to you. I know it's gonna be a shock hearing my voice coming at you like this from out of the past. I don't even know where to begin, what to say. I guess I should just start talking and let whatever happens, happen. I don't even know what you'll turn out to be like. If you want to hear what I have to say to you, if you'll even care. - Lorraine, I'm going out for a little while. - Are you sure you're up to it? - Sure, I'm sure. - Miranda, wait a minute. Look, I know I'm not your mother, and I have no right to interfere but, your father cares about you. Sometimes children don't think their parents do. Look, I know we don't know each other, but maybe in time we'll find that we do have things in common. Can we sit down and talk? - I'll be back in a little while, okay? - Sure, see you later. - Thanks, Lorraine. - These are transferred on the four cassettes. - Good. - hen will they be ready? - Three o'clock okay? - Oh, I'll need something to play them on it. Should be small, with earplugs and must be battery operated. - Okay, you got it. (melancholic music) - How far will this take me? - In what direction? - East, leaving today. - East? Chicago east enough? - Fine. - You leave at five o'clock, Gate E. - Thanks. - So, Miranda. What do I say to you now? Thoughts keep tumbling one on top of another, I can't even sort them out. I said to Johnny, your father, I said I want to find a way that I can talk to Miranda. Let her know how I feel about things. So, he bought me a tape recorder. And I'm tongue tied. Now I know what Johnny means about writer's block. How goes it there, Scout? How's Summer Dream? - Fantastic! I just finished chapter two, and it's so beautiful, I almost made myself cry! - Of course. I can see the reviews now. - Let me hear those reviews! - Um, this first effort by John Emmett Thatcher-- - Da dun! - Da dun! Is whatever a new novelist dreams of. With its lush, lush imagery, and fascinating characters, it has captured the glory that once-- - Oh, you're prejudice. But don't stop, I love it. - It's so good to be home. I feel real safe. Nothing can happen to me here. Just couldn't stay in that hospital a second longer than necessary. I could look around me and almost smell the fear. I had nothing in common with those people, they were all old and sick. Dying. Ms. Howard? Could I see you for a minute? - Mrs. Thatcher, please get back into your bed. - I have to ask you something. Have my tests come back yet? - [Ms. Howard] Your doctor is the only person who can give you that information. - Come on, you must've seen my charts. I can't stand this waiting anymore. - Look, I am a student nurse. I have only been here three months. Now, please. Leave me alone. - [Announcer] Chicago Limited now boarding, Gate 15. (loud commotion) - You want the window? - I don't care. You take it. - You take it! - [Woman] Leave that red case down. - [Man] I just put it up. - Well, take it down, I'm gonna need it. Sit down and be quiet. - Keep it over here. - [Woman] Look up at me. - [Mom] Oh, my beautiful Miranda. I wonder, will you have to wear braces on your teeth like I did? I hope not. Oh, and please don't have my stringy hair. I hope you like your name. Most kids can't stand their name. Your father picked it out for you. It's from The Tempest. I know this is going to sound strange to you, but I'm happier than I've ever been in my whole life. Which should tell you something about the way my life has been up until now. I was the loser of the world, complete washout. In fact, I don't know what I would've done if your father didn't come along just when he did. I met him at the lowest point in my whole life. It was like the whole world was closing in on me. It's funny, the way things turn out. - [Actress] You think someday it will hang in a museum? People will come from all over the world to see it. - [Johnny] Hey, it's sad, but not that sad. - [Actress] And now you must sign it. (somber music) - Harder. (blows nose) - Billy, get back to your seat right now. And don't annoy that lady. - Would you like to sit with me? (train rumbles) (car honks) - Well, hey, hey, hey! What do you say? - I could use some help. - What'd you do, clean out the library? - Just about. Librarian thought I was mad. You know what she said? There's a rule, young lady. Four books per cart. - Well, she's right, you know. - Do you know about that rule? - Well, of course. Everyone knows that. - What a dumb rule. - How'd you con her into letting you have all these? - I told her I had a terminal illness and I had a lot to read before they carried me out. Her mouth was hanging wide open when I left. - Well, let's see what you got here. - Well, I got some Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Christina Rossetti. And a little smidgen of Edna St. Vincent Millay. - They're all poets, huh? - This week. Gonna get to the playwrights next week. - Playwrights? What you got against novelists? - I ain't got nothing against novelists, I'm gonna get to them. - Yeah, I bet you will. - I'll get to them all. - Between your books, and the baby, and your tapes, when are you gonna have time for yours truly? - Make an appointment. - Well, I don't even know your phone number. Alright, young lady. Nap time. - Nap time? - Mhm. - You kidding? - No, I'm not. - I'm not tired. - It's doctor's orders, young lady. - I just got all these books. - Come on. - I'm too excited to sleep. - No, come on, baby. - Party pooper. - Oh, come on. Jan? You alright? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright. - Give me the books, dear. Go inside. - Yeah, you're right. I'm tired. I can't sleep. I just keep prowling the house, saying the same dumb things over, and over, and over again. Why me? God, why me? Somehow, things always seem worse at night. Pain. Fear. None of that, Janet. Think of something else. (somber music) Miranda. Miranda. When I think about all the things I'm gonna miss. School, parties, your report cards. First day. Dates. When I think of my dates, if you knew what a hell raiser your mother was. I had so many things wrong with me as a person, it's no wonder any guys looked at me at all. I couldn't do anything right. I had to learn it all the hard way. And my mother and I, always at each other's throats. I don't know why it was like that, but that's the way it was. Growing up in Cincinnati, oh brother. - Where are you going? - Out. - Your hem's come loose. - Where? - In the back. - I'll fix it later. - Don't you care what people think about the way you look? - Oh, come on, Ma. Don't start on me. - Where are you going? And don't tell me out. - I'm going to the movies! - [Janet's Mom] Who's we? - How come every time I want to go out it's like the Spanish Inquisition? - Your cousins are coming over. - I'll never be missed. - I don't want you seeing that boy! - 18 years old, and she's still telling me when to wipe my nose. I'll see who I want to. - Not while you live under our roof. - I can do something about that. - You watch your tongue, young lady! - Now, why can't one day go by without you two bickering? Janet, apologize to your mother! - I will not! - [Woman] Oh, I didn't know anyone was in here. I didn't mean to startle you. - [Miranda] Oh, that's alright. - Are you an insomniac too? That's what I hate about trains. They turn the lights down at 10 o'clock when they think everyone should be asleep. If I weren't such a coward, I'd fly. But, like my husband says, if God had wanted us to fly, he'd of given us wings. Isn't that original of him? (chuckles) You look like a college girl. At home visiting your family? - No. - I was visiting my son. If you could call it that. When I got this letter from him saying that he was dropping out of school, I had to come to find out for myself what was going on. Better I'd of stayed home in blissful ignorance. Nice looking. You have to see him now. And you should see the place he lives in, like a pigsty. After my clean house. And the girl he lives with, lives with, I'm choking on the words. I wonder when she took a bath last. When I asked them how they could live like that, do you know what they said? External things don't matter. They're into more important things. And they say they're happy. How could they be happy? When I asked him how he could live like this, he told me to mind my own business. Why, if I'd ever talk to my mother that way, she would've washed my mouth out with soap. I bet you don't talk to your mother that way. - I don't have a mother, she died when I was a baby. - Oh. I'm sorry. - So, here we are, and now I'm a mommy. And I feel totally unprepared to handle it. I mean, if God were to start handing out miracles tomorrow, and I got to stick around for a little while after all, I don't think I'd be much better at it than my mother was. (baby cries) Hey, you're supposed to be sleepy. Huh? What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? You're wide awake. You want to play? Hey, we can play for a while. We could play. We gotta be real quiet though, so we don't wake daddy up. Okay? Wanna dance? (relaxing music) Aw. Oh, Miranda, you smell so good. You feel so good. You're never gonna remember I held you like this. Oh, remember me, Miranda, please. - Buy you a drink? Me and my friend Phil are offering to buy you a drink. Name's Frank. - Thanks, but I don't care for any. - Come on, join us. - Two more scotches. - Lemonade. - Train rides can get pretty dull unless you find someone to talk to. - Yeah, we get sick of one of those company. - Traveling alone? - Yep. - Girls nowadays got guts. You know, in the old days, they never traveled alone. They were scared to death of being molested. - Things never change, do they? - Thank you. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? - Could I stop you? - She's sharp, Frank, a really sharp girl. - Don't you ever get cold like that wearing just a shirt? - Don't you ever get cold like that wearing just a shirt? (laughing) - That's terrific, really terrific. She's got you, Frank. - Hey, don't go. - You're a pig. - Hey, come on now. I didn't mean anything. - You meant plenty. What gives you the right to talk to me like that? - Well, baby, a girl like you just asks for it. - A girl like me? - Yeah, you girls, you put out for every long haired freak with a guitar, so don't get coy with me. - Okay, big boy. Put your money where your mouth is. - Hey, wait a minute. - In front of him? And somebody might walk in. - You like to play games. So play! (melancholic music) - I'm sitting here all alone in the middle of the night, and all I could think about was making love to Johnny. He's sleeping so peacefully. And what do I tell you about sex? This is silly, I'm embarrassed. Trying to give my own daughter advice and I'm blushing. Why would anything I have to tell you have any meaning years from now? There's one thing that will never change. There's sex when you love the boy, and then there's sex without love. - Hey, Jan. What's the matter with you anyway? - Nothing. I just want you to talk to me. - Yeah, sure. - No, I mean it. - Alright, what do you want to talk about? - I don't care. Anything. - I don't get it, what's with all this chit chat, huh? - Steve. Every night we come up here, and we never talk. - You trying to pull my leg, huh? - No, I'm serious. - Hey now, listen baby. This is the only language we need. Now, you come up here for the same reason I do, so what's the big deal, huh? Now Jan, I like you, I mean I really do, you know that. (melancholic music) - [Amtrak Employee] Fort Madison, Iowa. Fort Madison, Iowa. Fort Madison, Iowa. 15 minute stop! (phone rings) - Johnny? The phone's ringing. Johnny? - I'll get it! Jan. Long distance, your folks. - I don't want to talk to them. - You gotta tell them, honey. - [Janet] I can't. - Then let me. - No. Okay, I'll do it. Hello. - [Janet's Mom] Hello, dear! It's mother. - I know. How are you, Mother? - Fine, dear. And yourself? - I'm fine. - [Janet's Mom] And how's John? And my adorable grandchild? - Everybody's fine. Mother, why are you calling? - What a funny thing to say, we're just calling to say hello. - Mother, I got a cake in the oven, I gotta run. - [Janet's Mom] Dear. Your father and I have been thinking, his vacation's coming up, and we've never been to California. - Oh, Mother. It's really hot here now, you wouldn't like it. - All we have are photos of John and Miranda. We thought we'd like to meet them. - Mother, I've been married for two years, now you decide to visit? - Janet, you apologize to your mother! That's no way to talk to her. - I'm tired of apologizing. Goodbye. - What you're doing is very cruel, Janet. - An eye for an eye. - Oh, stop. - That's their teaching. They also had other such wonderful homilies, like what is sauce for the goose, is sauce for the gander. You remember that one? What about the good old golden rule? Do unto others. Of course my favorite was the one about the sins of the fathers. - What difference does it make now what they did to you in the past? So they made mistakes, we all make mistakes! - Ah, forgive them, for they know not what they do. - But you know what you're doing, and you know what this will do to them. They'll never recover from it. Now please, Janet. Get back on the phone and tell them! - Invite them to my funeral! - Hi. - Hi, love. Oh, thank you. - You were out early. - Yeah, I went down to the police station again. - Nothing? - Well, no news being good news. Or so they tell me. The Lieutenant down there did 20 minutes on the difficulty of finding runaway girls. Showed me all the charts, and statistics, and other data. And I was very impressed. - Summer Dreams. What's that? - Ah, it's a book I tried to write once. I don't know what made me drag it out again. Like a few thousand other young writers, I was gonna write the Great American Novel. I just finished rereading it. (chuckles) God, is it awful. That last summer with Janet I thought anything was possible. I wanted to write a great novel, Janet would recover miraculously. I should've entitled it Summer of Self Delusion. I kept thinking over the years that someday I'd get back to it, but of course, I never did. Why didn't you ever give Miranda her mother's tapes before? - I don't know. I wanted to give them to her when she didn't need them. Where is she? Where the hell is she? - Well, Miranda, my way of getting back at my mother was to run away from home. I was supposed to be on my way to my Aunt Evenlyn's, but I wasn't having any. I went to Los Angeles instead. (baby cries) Johnny? The baby's crying. - [Johnny] Well, see what she wants! (baby cries) - Come on, Johnny. You do it! - [Johnny] I can't, I'm busy! (baby cries) - Come here. (loud typewriting) Now, why couldn't you do that? - Cause I said I'm busy! - The whole world stops because genius is at work. - [Johnny] Yeah, something like that. - I could drop dead and you'd be so wrapped up in yourself you wouldn't even notice. - Yeah, look who's talking! You don't do a damn thing all day but lie around and feel sorry for yourself. The least you could do is look after your own baby! (somber music) Honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh baby, I didn't mean that. - [Janet] No, I'm sorry. - Stupid, insensitive thing to say. - I had no right to use being sick. - Yes you did. - No, I don't. - Yes you did. - No I don't. - Yes you do. - No I don't. - Yes you do. (laughing) (hopeful music) - Chicago. South Street Station. - It's getting worse now. The pain comes more often, and stays longer. I just want to be left alone. Miranda, remember when I was telling you about running away from home? Well, as they say, confession is good for the soul. You want to know what really finished it for me with my parents? There's a jingle we kids used to recite. The boys are allowed to go out and play, but in the end, it's the girls who pay. - You'll stay with Aunt Evelyn until it's over. Of course, I'll come up towards the end. - And you'll do everything your aunt says with none of your backtalk. - I don't have to tell you what an inconvenience this is for her. Your father and I will tell people that you were sick, and had to have change of air for a while. - And the doctors were concerned that it might be TB. - Later, of course, when you return, we'll explain that it was all a false alarm. - Why don't you just say that I died and I was resurrected? - Janet! - Don't I have anything to say about what happens to me? - You gave up that right when you got yourself into trouble! - Now, we have to undo the damage. We have to live in this town, Janet. (door slams) - I look terrible. I've lost so much weight. When I think of how hard I used to try to diet. They're wearing the sack this year. And hats with veils, and blood red nail polish. Oh God, I feel so ugly. Miranda. If I could teach you one thing, I would say try hard to like yourself. The things I've done to myself out of self hatred. - I'm not that kind of doctor. But who sent you to me? Where'd you get my name? - In the phone book. - You better leave. - No. You've gotta help me. - I can lose my license just by talking about this. - I don't know anyone in Los Angeles, I'm all alone here. Now, I've got to find somebody. - Where are you from? - Cincinnati. What difference does it make? - You could go home. - No, I couldn't go home. - Look, Miss. Just call your parents, I'm sure they'll understand. - No, they won't understand! - Keep your voice down. - If you won't help me, I'm gonna have to do it myself. - Alright. - What do I owe you? - Nothing. Just get out of here. - Thank you. Well, now I knew where to go. I had come this far, and there was no turning back. Please God, I don't want to die! I'll do anything you want. Tell me it's all a mistake. Please! - Janet. - It's dark in here. Don't let them put me in a box, in the ground. Don't let them do that to me. - Darling. - Please. I don't want to be cremated either. Me, burning. Nothing left of me but ashes. Oh, don't let them do it to me. - I won't. - Please, don't let them do it to me. - I won't, dear. - Promise? - I promise. - Promise? - I promise, I swear to God. - Oh, Miranda, forgive me for dying on you. - Get in. (lighthearted music) - Hi, darling. Bet you wondered what happened to me. Has it really been four weeks since I've last talked with you? My, how time flies when you're having fun. No. I guess the truth is that I didn't really want to finish my sorted story. So, fasten your seatbelt, Miranda. Here's where it gets a bit rocky. (dog barks) - You the girl with the appointment? - Yes. - You got the money? - Yes. (dog barks) - Doctor. - Alright, get that skirt off. Come on, snap it up. - You ever seen the Watts Towers? They're incredible. You know, it's just amazing what he did with little pieces of broken bottle and coffee cups, and little pieces of broken tile. All kinds of junk. - Your underwear too. - It's dirty in here. - Just close your eyes and pretend you're at Mayo Clinic. - Aren't you gonna wash your hands? - These gloves are sterile. - Well, what about anesthetic? - You won't need it. It'll be over before you know it. Come on, Miss. Lie down. - Wait. - We haven't got all day! - I changed my mind. - It'll be alright. Everybody's nervous at the beginning. - I'm not nervous. I just changed my mind. I mean, when an old man can take a bunch of cracked coffee cups and make something beautiful out of them... I'm gonna keep my baby, thank you. - Now look, you're not getting your money back. - I don't care. - It's your life! - [Evan] Jenny. Jenny, Jenny. - [Jenny] Hello, Evan. - [Evan] Hello. - [Jenny] Where are we? - Together. Poor darling. You must be warn out, I'm sorry. - Mhm, I fell asleep. - Yeah. Look, look. It's finished. - [Jenny] Oh, Evan. Is it really of me? - [Evan] It's you. A portrait of Jenny. - Oh, I think it's a fine painting. - Do you? - [Jenny] I think it will make you famous. I think someday it'll hang in a museum, and people will come from all over the world to see it. - [Johnny] Hey, it's sad, but not that sad. - [Jenny] And now you must sign it. - Harder. (blows nose) Hey, you know what I'm doing here? - No. - Well, I'm a film nut, see, but I'm also a writer. So that gives me an excuse for going to the movies in the afternoon. What's your excuse? - [Jenny] My heart seems to stop. - Hey, come on. Now it can't be that bad. Look, I can match any hard luck story with any of yours any day. (Janet sobs) What's the problem? - I'm pregnant. And I'm broken, I'm scared. - I'll see you around. - [Jenny] Spending our whole lives together. (Janet sobs) - Alright, you convinced me, you got some big trouble. But you've also got two choices. Now, you can sit here and feel sorry for yourself, or you can let me buy you a cup of coffee. Now, what's it gonna be? Crying or coffee? - Coffee. - Okay. (lighthearted music) - [Man] You're on a bummer? - No, it's nothing like that. - Well, it's gotta be something. - Yeah, it's something. My father's not really my father. And the only reason I'm here today, is because of some dirty doctor. How's that for a kick in the head? (lighthearted music) (tires screech) - Hey, dummy! (sobbing) (lighthearted music) What? You need a ride? Well, you got two choices. You could stand here in the middle of nowhere blubbering, or you can take your chances with me. Well? Which is it? Blubbering or me? - You. - My name's Dave Hanley, what's yours? - [Janet] Why'd you marry me, Johnny? - Well, I'll tell you. Any gal that goes to the movies in the middle of the afternoon is my kinda gal. - No, really? - Why, I took one look at you, and bells rang, and my eyes crossed, and I went ooh! - Seriously? - Oh, stop fishing for compliments, will you? - I don't know why. How does anyone know why? All I knew was I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. Don't, Jan. All that matters is now. We're here, Mandy and me. Everyone that loves you is here. Where you going, honey? - You're gonna think I'm crazy. But I don't hate them anymore. - Go on, Janet, call home. - Hello, Operator? I'd like to make a long distance call please. Cincinnati. Person to person, to Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Oliver. Klondike 5-4-5-2-0. Janet Thatcher. Gladstone, 84399. Hi, Mom? Would you put Dad on the phone? There's something I have to tell you. The sun feels warm on my face. It feels so good. I get tired more easily these days. I should really get up and get dressed and get out of this silly robe. But, it doesn't seem worth the effort. - Hi there. (bell rings) Breakfast now being served on the patio. Hot. Bad night? Why didn't you wake me? That's what husbands are for. - Johnny, we gotta talk. - Drink your coffee now, before it gets cold. - Promise me something. - Anything, you name it. - You'll finish your book. - I will. - I don't want you to give up any of your dreams. - I won't, I promise. Cross my heart. - And Miranda. I want you to find a mother for her. Don't wait too long, she's just a little girl, she needs a mother. - Yes, I'm glad you brought that up, see. Because I've already picked someone out. Yes, one Fanny Myrtle Kronighouser. Teaches ballet to a group of Eskimos up in Alaska. (laughing) - You're a fool. (lighthearted music) - Come on inside. - [Janet] I love you, Johnny. - [Johnny] I love you too, Jan. - I guess you could say I'm drifting. - Yeah. Yeah, I can dig it, I've been there. I was into campus politics. A couple of peace marches, the whole bit. Then I bummed around the country trying to get myself together. - And? - Oh, I don't know. I just got tired of trying to change the whole world. So I figured making it with people one on one was about the best that I could do. (chuckles) I got myself an advertising job. I thought that I'd make myself some bread for a change, you know? I don't know. Maybe I'll like it. - [Miranda] Wouldn't you call that selling out? - Yeah. My father was a dentist. You know what he said to me just before I went on to college? (chuckles) He said, he said, son, a pimply faced kid of 17 wanted to be a dentist, and now the 40 year old man with a potbelly and a receding hairline hates poking around in people's mouths. He'd rather go fishing. - I don't get it. - Well, what my old man meant was nothing, nothing has to be forever. So, I'll try this for a while, if it wears thin, I'll try something else. But wherever I'm headed, I'll get there. (lighthearted music) - I lived with my father 19 years, and I never knew the kind of man he is. When he gave me the tapes, I took off, I didn't know where I was going. I just wanted to listen to them. It was as though my mother's voice was taking me somewhere. Telling me something. - Darling, Miranda. I'm glad you can't see your old mother now. Got me surrounded by bottles of witches brew and snake oil. I've got a tube stuck in my arm, if I move an inch, I'd pull the plug on myself. There sure ain't nothing glamorous about checking out. - Jan. - Hi. - How are you, dear? - Well, I'm feeling pretty good. Everything considered. How was your trip? - Great. California's just like everything everyone said, all those orange trees. - And palm trees, my goodness. - You oughta take some dates back with you when you go. They grow them out in the desert. - Oh, my baby. (sobbing) I'm so sorry. (sobbing) - [Dave] Look, you sure you don't want me to go with you? There's no hassle, I got plenty of time. - [Miranda] No, I'd rather do it alone. - [Dave] Okay. Okay, I understand. - Thanks for everything. - Listen, I might get out to the coast, maybe next summer. I'd like to look you up. - I want you to. - You consider it though, okay? (melancholic music) (somber music) - An alphabetic journey. If I can, so can you. Listen to this, Miranda. I found it in a book of poetry. When I'm dead, my dearest, sing no sad songs for me, plant no roses at my head, nor shady cypress trees. Be the green grass above me, with showers and dewdrops wet. And if thou wilt remember, and if thou wilt forget, I shall not see the shadows, I shall not feel the rain, I shall not hear the nightingale sing on as if in pain. I'm getting tired now, Miranda.
