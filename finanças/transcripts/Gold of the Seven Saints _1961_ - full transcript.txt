If you would like to be dead, move the gun. I would not like to be dead. Perhaps you will be dead anyway because I do not like horse thieves. - Horse thief? - Si. But, I'd every intention of paying. Good. Well, perhaps if you pay enough, you will live. - Very pretty. - Thanks. Hey... the money. - But I just... - The money. - Take the horse amigo. - Gracias. It is a pleasure to do business with you, Buenas noches. Buenas noches. - Good morning partner. - Took you long enough. That the best you could steal? Well I, didn't steal him exactly. I ran into a little trouble and had to pay. Had to pay? With what? Wait, you know that prize nugget I was up to... saving to trim that fancy vest chain I was going to buy myself. You paid with gold? It was pay or get shot and you wouldn't want to see me shot, would you? Or would you? Anybody follow you? I don't think so but just to make sure I snarled up the tracks right and good. Well, just the same we better get out of here fast. That wasn't just some lone water-washed nugget you handed over. Anybody that knows gold... gets a look at it is going to know there's a lot more where that came from. Yes sir, somebody is had a smell of this, maybe they got friends. There was nothing else I could do. Well, if that horse... can keep his legs under him until we get to Seven Saints, we pick up fresh horses there. Is that all they got in that town, horses? Seven Saints, it's wide open. - Plenty of booze and plenty of women. - Then what we talking about horses for? Women. Am I going to have myself a time. You know, it was a damn sight easier picking this stuff up piece by piece... than all in one chunk. Funny, isn't it? Some men spend all their lives looking for gold and never find it. And we fell into it when all we wanted was furs. Yeah, sure came easy enough.

You're just borrowing trouble. Have we not got enough of it already? Look at this dog, already is breaking down. Well, he's carrying too much weight, we should had two horses. I was lucky to get away with one. Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, we can all use a little rest tonight, see some shade in those rocks. You know, I can't wait till we hit town and start spending some money. I had enough of this wild country and trapping to last me forever. Oh, what are you squawking about? You've been trapping for three years. - And four months. - And four months. I've been working this country ever since I was big enough to pack a rifle. And what have you got to show for it? Until we found that gold, nothing. Except maybe keeping the hair on top of your head... instead of it being used to trim the fringe on some Indian's Sunday-best breeches. No thanks to you. That would you do have to admit she was the prettiest little squaw you ever did see. After all, it wasn't my fault you got blamed for what I did. Oh no, of course not, but like the old saying goes... when a man is get a friend like you he don't need no enemies. Well, that's all behind us now partner. We're rich. Now we start living. And no more trapping for us. You know, it's been so long since I slept under a roof... I don't know if I'm going to like it or not. Well, paint the ceiling blue and put some gold stars on it. A house is a good thing though, solid and steady. Not like a 7 skinner lodge, which you got to move every time... that weather changes and the game shifts. You don't have to have a big strong woman to put it up and take it down again either. I think I'll get me one of those... soft, milky white ones that smell like perfume instead of bear grease. And she's going to wear nothing but silk and lace. - And I'm going to have me a big white bed. - Now you're talking. Rainbolt, I'll tell you one thing I learned about towns a long time ago. Their no place to be poor in. There full of bosses, somebody to yell your name and make you jump. But not anymore. Anybody who says my name now is going to have to say it soft like. And say please. Alright, I'm saying it soft like. Please come on up here and have a look. Told you I had an itch between my shoulder blades. Looks like white men. They're riding bunched up together. If they were Indians, they'd be strung out. - How many do you make them out to be? - It's hard to tell from here. But from the size of the dust they're raising I'd say about 8 or 10. We're not in very good shape for running but... there's too many of them to fight, so we'd best get moving. - What's the matter? Something bothering you? - Oh no. No, I just don't see why this country has to be laying on its side all the time. You have any mountains in Ireland? Sure we do, pretty little ones and they stay where they don't bother you... unless you go looking for them and I never went looking. ♪ I am a lad who has a lot of things to do... ♪ And I gone to get it done, I promise you... ♪ ♪ Oh, me throat is parched and dry so stack them bottles high... ♪ ♪ Because I'm going to drink them dry before I'm through. ♪ - You sound happy again. - Well, why shouldn't I be?

Too flat and too hot, And we leaving tracks big enough for a drunken half Molly to follow. If you know a better way to Seven Saints, lead on. You're the boss pathfinder. Now how about unbending so we can stop for a little drink? Not yet, we still got better than 10 miles till the next water hole. 10 miles? Alright pathfinder, what now? We sure can't double back. - We sure can't. - It's going to be kind of a dry trek. Yeah, kind of. Well, one thing for sure. Our friends back there are going to find it just as dry. Now, that's a fact. That's the first good word I heard from you all day partner. I'll try not to let it happen again. Rainbolt, it's no use. I must've a little rest. Figure is about time for our last drink of water partner. Right now I'd give a whole sack full of that gold for about... half interest in a good big barrel just... brimming full of nice cool water. Oh, I double that bid. - On your feet boy. - They're coming, eh? Yeah. You know, I'm beginning to feel real bitter toward them fellas. That rock formation. - There's water there. - What we waiting for? Well? We can run or we can stay and fight. I'm too tired to run anymore. And I'm not only tired, I'm mad. The fact is, I didn't realize how mad I could be. We've got the water and they haven't. - That gives us an edge. - It's a big one. Maybe it's just enough of an edge, I reckon we'll chance it. They're nowhere in sight, maybe we can get a little sleep yet. Well, I could sure use it. We can't both sleep at the same time. I was afraid you was going to stay that. You first. Not so good, was it? - The, the sun was in me eyes. - Sure, it was. I always lose, can't understand why I keep on playing. That looks like a good place to watch from. - Wake me when the shadow hits this rock. - Yes sir. Oh, better unsaddle the horses, we can't have their backs getting sore. Yes sir. This is a fine state of affairs. Here am I, one of the richest men in these parts and I can't even sleep when I... Rainbolt, my friend... how much will you take to let me sleep first? - Oh, what are you talking about? - It just occurred to me. Here am I with all this gold burning a hole in my pocket. And there's no liquor and no pretty girls... so I might as well buy myself something I want. I'll give you one ounce of dust out of my half-share. - Not interested. - 2 ounces. 4. If you want to double that, you get yourself a deal. Doubled. I never realized before what a wonderful thing it is to have money. Hey Shawn, time is up, time is up. Oh, that's funny, I don't feel like I had any sleep at all. We got company. - Hey, where you going? - I'll be back. Hey down there, anybody want a nice cold drink of water? Hey, I don't blame you for wanting to have a little fun but how about me? If you get your head blowed off, how long do you think I can stand them off alone? You're right but it just does my heart good to think of them out there suffering... with their tongues swollen up in their mouths and dry as sticks... and their eyes burning out of their heads... and their skin kind of crisping up and peeling away. - How long you think they can hold out? - Well, they got to make a move pretty quick. Either rush us or pull out and go someplace else for water. Hey, you up there, I want to parley. Well, come on out in the open where we can see you. And I'll put a bullet right through your guts. I want to make a deal. You give us just half that gold and we'll call it quits. What do you say? - You hear me? - Yeah. Did you hear me? Now listen, let's be sensible. We got you outnumbered and you're pinned down. Yeah and we got the water. So have we. - We got lots of it. - Sure you have. You filled up at that last dry water hole. Drink hearty. Look, you ought to make a deal now while you got a chance. Didn't I make myself clear? That's the only deal you're going to get from us. Partner, I think we won this round. - Maybe. - What you mean? Like I said, they're going to have to make a move. Maybe now, maybe after sundown. - They pulled out. - Yeah, let's get the water. Alright, come on, let's move. Get the horses. Come on. On your feet Daisy, come on, this is no time to lie down and rest. Now please old girl, get up. It's no use Rainbolt, the poor beast is gone as far as she can with that load. We're going to have to switch it over to the other horses. Well, that means we walk... - and I don't think we have time. - You get a better idea? Not right at the moment. We get this gold off her back, she'll be up and walking better than the rest of us. Rainbolt, I must've a little breather. I hate to admit it but I'm just a mite tired. Yeah, me too. This ain't no good, no good at all. We got to figure something Shawn and we got to do it now. We don't, we're going to wind up as buzzard bait. That's a happy thought. I tell you, I don't see no other way but to stash the gold... and come back for it later when we get loose of this wolf pack. Right now I don't care much what happens to that gold. Just so long as them murdering... thieving, gold loving heathens don't get their hands on it. Hey Rainbolt, you've done a grand job there. Not even the leprechauns could find that. Hey, how do the packs look? - Like 250 pounds of gold. - Thank you. You know partner, I, I just realized something and it worries me a little. You know this country real good, don't you? You could find this spot again without any trouble at all. Yeah. Well, I'm not so sure that I can. That means I need you but you don't need me. And that worries you? You see, if you get killed, I'm broke but on the other hand... if I get killed then you're twice as rich. Why Shawn, would I do anything to break up our partnership over... a measly 125 pounds of gold? Maybe. Here we go again. May be white men but they sure track like Injuns. That's true. Wish we didn't have to drag this poor dog with us. But you're right, if we leave him, they'll know for sure we stashed the gold. And it won't be too hard for them to figure just where. Maybe we ought to lead them off a way, don't you know? Yeah, we'll lead them alright. If we're real lucky, we'll lead them into a trap they'll never get out of. You found a trap alright. - Yeah and we're in it. - Only an eagle could get over that wall. And I'm no eagle, what now pathfinder? We'll have to double back. - I want a parley. - Again? Again, come out where we can talk. We can listen to you just fine from here. Look, all this shooting ain't going to get us nothing... except maybe a few bodies to bury. Now let's be sensible, talk this over like businessmen. We can make some kind of a deal. Did you hear me? - Real talkative, ain't he? - Yeah. Yeah, we hear you. So far you haven't said much. Look, we got you run into a box. You're going to have a problem, an eating problem. I'm going to send one of my boys back for supplies. What are you figuring on having for dinner? - We're not hungry. - No? That's good because we're all ready to sit it out down here for the next 30 days. By then I'll be hungry. Hey Shawn, slip back to the horses and get us some shells, will you? Alright, let's hear your deal, make it good. Like I said, I'm a businessman, and we split the gold 50/50... Half for you and half for us. That way we can all live to spend it. And you take your time and think it over. We ain't in no hurry. 50/50 and I'll give you till sundown to make up your mind. I thought somebody said nothing but an eagle could get up there. That was you, how bad you hit? Don't worry, I'll still be around for my half the gold. Another eagle, looks like this one is on our side. Move out, move out. That eagle is got one heck of a gun. Gee, I'm sorry about that, I got up there as fast as I could but that's a long climb. - We're much obliged that you did. - My pleasure. Would you mind telling your friend to put that rifle down? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Gates, Wilson Gates, MD. Stands for doctor of medicine. - You telling us you're a doctor? - Yes sir. - What are you doing way out here? - Came out here for my health. - We all suffer from the same disease. - What kind of disease? Auriferous anemia. Layman's language, it's a severe and prolonged lack of gold. With such an epidemic in town, you shouldn't have paid for the packhorse with a nugget. Now don't you start, was most unfortunate. Young fella, you just coil yourself around here, that's rough. You don't have to worry about Mccracken and his gang, that is for a little while anyway. We shot them up pretty good. Take them a few hours to lick their wounds, get organized before they hit you again. That's fine. Look fella, I'm going to be frank with you. This isn't the first time I ever dressed a wound with a gun at my back... but it always makes me a mighty big nervous. You see, the patient is liable to scream out and startle the fella with the gun... he's liable to jump and pull the trigger, then where am I? So I just assume you put it down. Appreciate what you did doc... why you did it is something else again. How do we know you don't have a bunch of your own hid out... there someplace waiting to rush us? Well, we can discuss the why after I get through patching up your friend here. As for a bunch, I don't have one. If I did they had, they'd come from up there. So why don't you point the rifle up there? Now look fella, want you to take yourself a good deep breath. This ain't going to hurt you much more than you can stand, eh? Ok. Sleeping like a baby. Sure glad I got the slug out of him. Now all he needs is rest and care but a heap of it. Well, he sure ain't going to get it on this rock. Well, you're out of supplies too, and them fixing to hit us again. - Where were you headed? - Seven saints. - That's too far, he'll never make it. - No chance? All that rough horse backing shaking him up, liable to kill him. Not if he's banded. A friend not too far from there, name is Gondora. Demarcil Gondora? - Yeah, you know him? - Just by reputation. Hear he's real good at cattle business, especially other people's cattle. Yeah, Demarcil is always had a talent for finding stock before it gets lost. Made a couple of runs with him myself. They tell the old bandit is got himself quite a spread now. No offense meant but don't you suppose he might be tempted with your gold? - Said he was a friend. - A good one I hope. Well, I guess I'll find out, get no choice now. Soon as that fella comes to, I'll give him a good stiff... dose of brandy and then we ought to be moving. Say, you figuring maybe Mcracken and Green River got such a licking they going to quit? They won't, either one of them, they don't scare. And they've stuck out their necks before for a lot less. I've watched them for a couple of years now. Taking anything that they want, whether is food, jug of wine, somebody's wife. Everybody is afraid to open their mouth yeah, including me. I've been itching to pull out on them, never had a chance before. You didn't let them know you buried the gold, did you? Told you that rifle was making me nervous. How is a doctor come to be so handy with a gun? I was good with a gun before I was a doctor. Time came when I met up with somebody was better than I was. And I woke up with an old man bending over me, picking out the lead. Laid around for quite a while with him taking care of me. And I got to figuring, maybe he's smart than me. Taking the lead out of people instead of putting it in. That's where I learned my doctoring, from him. Well, you sure didn't forget how to use that gun either. Thanks, now suppose you give me yours. - Sure. - Much obliged. Now I'm going to ask you one more time, does Mccracken know you buried the gold? No. Good, because if he did, he'd cap on your trail till... doomsday knowing you'd have to come back for it sooner or later. Now you wonder how I knew, eh? Well, I'm going show you. Look. Saddlebags filled with gold don't bounce around in the breeze. See what I mean? These are a dead giveaway. You better fill them with rocks or something. Look, the important thing is that I don't know where you buried the gold. I followed Mccracken because I figured you were going to need help. Why didn't you throw in with him? The weight is all on their side. For the same reason that when I'm called to treat a patient... I don't throw in with the fever. Besides, Mccracken and his men aren't the kind to share anything. Oh, what makes you so different? You're no more entitled to the gold than they are. Main reason is there's only one of me and I only want a fair share. - A fair share. - It's what I said. In exchange, I'll give you all I can in knowledge and services. As you can see, gunshot wounds are my specialty. Also broken bones, fits, fevers, snakebites... tick fever, fluxes, carbuncles and tooth pulling. Yeah tooth pulling. That's the only part that I don't like. Wilson Gates sir, at your service. Well, that's my offer. I'll tell you what doc. You pull my friend through alive, you can name your own price out of my share. We going to drink to that. You kind of fond that young fella, ain't you? Sort of used to him after three years. He's got a knack for getting us into trouble and his... mouth is too big for his size sometimes. But there ain't nobody I'd rather have backing me. Sorry. I'll do the doctoring, we'll get him through. You know doc, I think maybe I'm going to be glad I met you. You don't have to be that glad. - Don't worry, they're back there somewhere. - Yeah but the question is, how far? - You alright Shawn? - Yeah. - Anything I can do for you? - Yeah, quit fussing over me. I've no intention of dying and leaving... what's left of my half to you and this old vulture back here. - I'm going to make it. - Hey doc, you see what I mean, mouth? - Hey doc... - Yeah? You know that, that nice, happy, brandy, foggy feeling? - It's beginning to wear off again. - Well, we can fix that. There's the best medicine in the world. Best medicine I've ever found anyway. Ah, it's better. - Doctor, I'm the patient here, remember? - Sorry friend, here you are. Now just a couple of tablespoons boy. Oh, that's fine, that does it, yes sir. Not even sufficient for a single dose, that's hardly worth saving. Greatest thing in the world for a sick man. Tell me something doctor, how you figure on refilling that prescription out here? Friend, I never venture forth without ample medical supplies. - No gun. - Raise up your hands, raise up your hands. Estupidos, put down your guns. Rainbolt, my friend. It's good to see you, amigo. My golly, it's good to see you Gondora, it's been a long time. - How long? Three, four years? - More like five. Hey, that is a long time too long. It's not possible you get bigger. Well, you know you ain't exactly shrinking none yourself. Hey, what happened to this one? Oh, he's the careless type, my partner Shawn Garrett. It's good to see you Shawn Garrett. It's very foolish of you to be so careless with the bullet. Thanks, I'll try to remember that the next time I get shot. These men that do the shooting, they try to take the furs, eh? From Gondora, they take nothing. With me you are safe and the furs... Why, big trapper like you, no furs? Other times when you come through you have many skins, what happened? Meet my other partner doc gates. Oh, a doctor? Doctor Wilson gates, MD, at your service. Gunshot wounds are my specialty. - Also snakebites... - Enough, enough. Armenderez, Armenderez, come down here. Armenderez, he is a good man. Very fine with pistola, I teach him myself. This is Armenderez, this my old friend Rainbolt. And the old one, he is doctor. For six days already, his wife, she is to have the baby. - Still no baby. - Baby? Si baby. All the time she cry, she scream. Poor man, he has not slept in week already. Come, we go now to the house of Gondora Tonight is fiesta, eh? - Armenderez, take the packhorse. - Thanks just the same, I can handle him. Whatever you say, my friend. Clean the horses, see they are fed, give them water. Our guests, show them hospitality. Pronto, pronto. - Armenderez, come here. - Si patrón. You leave señor Rainbolt to struggle with these all alone? It's alright, I can handle it. Strong like the bull this one, eh? Hey, heavy furs, eh? Come. Again, welcome to the house of Gondora. Come in. Hey, wake up. Luis, we have guests. Jose, tequila. - Juanita... - Si patrón? You make ready the hot water to clean right for the bandages. Soon we fix you up but first we get a little drunk like good caballeros, eh? I think that's an excellent suggestion. I can see that our little visit here with you is going to be most delightful sir. Gracias señor. - Patrón my wife, maybe the good doctor... - Oh, the baby. I forget. - Doctor, you go now with Armenderez. - Certainly. To your health sir. That is excellent. - Now to the baby. - Por aquí doctor, por favor. Oh, if he's doctor, he bring the babies like he drink the Tequila. Oh Rainbolt, my friend, forgive me. You're the guest of Gondora and I allowed you to stand like the bull with these bolsas. Forgive me, come. - Señor Shawn, pour yourself a drink. - Oh thanks very much. Here, you take the key. Your furs, they will be safe. You lock the door, no one enters. You understand for many years Gondora teach his men to be bandido first-class. Is not always so easy to unteach. - This give Gondora a big worry. - I'm sure it does. You take the key. Everything, she is alright? - Everything is alright. - Good, sit down. - Now we have nice little drink together? - Yeah, I could go for that. Five years since you honor the house of Gondora. Patron, patron, the doctor, he... señor Rainbolt. - Say, that's not... - Yes. Oh, it's so good to see you, it's just like old times. Yeah, only better. It's been some nice changes. - Here, let's have a look at you. - Help yourself, my friend. Yes sirree. - It's been a right productive five years. - You like? - I like. - Nobody asked me but I like too. Oh, this is my partner Shawn Garrett. - Oh, señor Shawn, you're badly hurt. - Oh, yeah. - Can I do something to help? - Oh, I'm sure you can. Already I've ordered the hot water and the bandages. Good but now I should get you right into bed. Well, that's a very good start. Hey Chickie, you better watch out for this one. Oh, Tita does not have to watch out. Am I not the property of the great patrón? - You mean you two are married? - Oh no. Who wants to get married? Well, it sounds like a mighty fine arrangement. Oh, I like it, I like it very much. I'm very flattered señor, but is not as you think. Yeah. Many years ago I buy a skinny little sparrow from the yaquis. Tougher even than the Comanches, these yaquis. I pay much gold for that little sparrow, now she's a nice fat chicken. Soon I sell her again for much more gold. In the meantime, she's under my protection, eh? I would've thought by now that... Well, you got a healthy bunch of boys around here, how come none of them ever... Young ones do not have the price and the old ones, they do not have the courage. Tita, Tita... - Tita please, the good doctor, he's waiting. - Ah, the doctor. He sent me to bring him a box of snuff and a goose quill. - Quick get the box of snuff. - Snuff? - Si. - For a baby? - Si. - Snuff? Excuse me. Partner, I think I'm going to like it here. Figured you would. The doctor is putting snuff into the hollow quill. Now he bends over Maria and blows the snuff into her nose like this. - Congratulations. - Muchas gracias doctor. Not at all. My pleasure sir, I assure you. You know, that's one of the finest quill babies I've ever fetched. - Bravo Armenderez. - Muchas gracias patrón. It's an amazing thing what a pinch of snuff can do in an emergency. Almost never fails, your snuff box sir. Oh, I do not think I ever dare to use it again. No please, you keep it. - Thank you. - Quill baby, eh? Señor, I am happy to know you. Tonight we have double fiesta, we honor new baby. Rainbolt Shawn Gates Armenderez. Hey, is that not a wonderful new name in the house of Gondora? - Seguro jefe. - And tonight we honor our fine guests. We get very drunk, eh? We get drunk. Hey young fella, in your condition I don't recommend this. Excellent. Now, I'm prescribing a good dose of rest for you. - Señor Shawn, your room is in there. - Come on. Thank you señor. - I don't know, I don't know. - Hey doctor... - Yeah? - What is it? Something trouble you? Rainbolt Shawn Gates Armenderez for a girl? Nice, eh? - Everything is nice. - You enjoy? Yes? - I enjoy. - Good. - Of course, I could use a little more soap. - Oh, some more soap. Soap, soap... Oh, I get for you. - Oh, excuse me señores. - Anytime Tita, anytime. You can go now doctor. - You need more bandages señor doctor? - No but gracias. De nada. - Soap? - Yeah, fine. Oh please, I wash for you the back. Sure. - Good? - Oh, the feels good. A little bit lower on the left, eh? Yeah. Do you have to keep pulling and probing like that? Look, I tell you what, I'll give you 6 ounces of gold if you don't treat me. You know, it's first time a patient ever offered me money for not treating him. You could get rich that way. The way you do it, people all over the world would pay you not to treat them. - You're a little feverish there. - If I wasn't I'd see a doctor. Oh, nothing like a good bleeding to fix a man up. Prostrates the system so the fevers and infections have nothing to work on. - Now what you think you're doing? - Say we were going to prostrate the system. That's fine, I'd just as soon not be prostrated. But if you think it's best, go ahead, we both bleed together, then we'll both feel fine. - Well, what you waiting for? - Well, bleeding is fine in theory but... somehow it doesn't always hold up in practice. So, let's forget the whole thing, eh? Bleed me, as if I hadn't lost enough blood already. Putting a little something back would be more to the point. - Hey partner. - Hey, right back here, eh? - Partner, we are partners, are we not? - Oh sure, yeah. - Everything 50-50, right? - Right. Well, I was... I said I was wondering, when do I get my bath? Oh? Well, this could go on for a long time. You in no hurry, are you? Hey. Juanita. Juanita. Juanita. Juanita. Juanita. Juanita. Hey, tell me Gondora, is she really for sale? Certainly, you like to buy her? Tita, how would you like to have a string of beautiful white pearls... - to put around that lovely neck of yours? - Make it diamonds and earrings to match. Pearls and Paris gowns, and we'll go to Paris to buy them. Paris? How would you like to go around the world in your own yacht? Wait a minute, the way you fellas spend your money is your business... - but remember, I got a share of that coming. - Oh, hey doctor... maybe you would like to make the bid too? I'm a law-abiding citizen and purchasing a girl hardly seems legal to me. Legal señor? What is this legal? If I say a thing shall be, it is. Seems like a simple enough arrangement to me. - Same for me. - And tita doesn't mind? Tita does not mind what señor? Being for sale like a bag of apples or a prize horse. Tita does not mind. I like. I like very much. Don't you ever worry about what's going to happen to you after you're sold? I do not worry, I only worry which one. - I don't understand. - Juanita Juanita... Juanita. Juanita. - Gracias. - De nada. - I wish to propose a toast. - Not another one. Certainly. To our dear and gracious host, señores, señoritas, caballeros and... to my new found friends. I do not wish to appear... sentimental but in my heart, I feel that... I am sorry my friend but I did not wish to wake you. - I'm sure you didn't. - You have nice rest? Fine. I just want to make sure everything, she's safe. - You mean the gold. - Yes. See, I was most worried. - Well, I wouldn't worry, it's safe. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. It's buried. Buried? Hey, he's very smart. I see you do not forget the tricks you learned when you worked for Gondora? - I don't forget anything. - You'll have no trouble finding it again? - I can find it. - Want to go? Hey amigo, I give you a plan. Tomorrow, first thing, me, my men... All good ones, we ride with you. Hey, these fellows that give you a chase, still in the hills. We get rid of them, then we go, you dig up the gold, eh? Then if you like, we make little deal, eh? Nice honest deal. Your partner Shawn, he does not have to know nothing, eh? And you leave a little gold with Gondora and I sell Tita to you? Is fair? - Amigo, tomorrow? - Patrón, patrón. - Patrón, patrón. - What? Are you crazy? - Stampede, they stampede the herd. - Stampede? What do you say? It's true patrón, bandidos with pistolas, they come out of the night and run our herd. Vamos, pronto. - Hey, you hear that? Bandidos, stampede. - Sounds like Mccracken's work to me. Yeah, you're right, when they find they cannot get your gold... they quick decide to take my cattle, so I do not have you struggle for nothing. Let's go get them back for you. Hey Ricardo. - Where do you think you're going? - I'm going with you. Oh no, you got no business going anywhere but back to bed. I figure I owe him something. We'll pay him back for you, we'll bring him Mccracken's scalp on a whirled hoop. What do you say? Bandidos, stampede? I do not understand patrón. - Armenderez, how many men were they? - I do not know. The bandidos who start the cattle running, they disappear. When finally the cattle stop, there was nobody there. - Strange bandidos, eh? - Yeah, real strange. You, go, bring in the herd. Shawn, Shawn... Oh, my poor little Chickie. They break doors. They come not long after you leave, they look for gold. - Where's Shawn? - Sir, he try protect me. Señor Don Quito drunk. Tita, listen to me, where's Shawn? What happened to him? They beat him, they beat him. Crazy man say, where gold? They beat señor Shawn and take him and the doctor away. Easy now, easy. They know we stashed the gold, they going to try to make Shawn and doc tell where. It's better they kill your friends quick. Now until they talk, they die slow. Wait, soon my men come back, we ride with you. You wait, I can't. You boys getting tired of standing in the sun? Well, stop playing games, get down to business. Now the gold, where is it? You looking for your friends to come along and help you. - That ain't a very good gamble. - That's the only one we have. That wind we come through last night will wipe out all our tracks... and they'll never find us in this country. Alright boys, I'm waiting. I've got just one thing to say to you Mccracken. Alright doc, you poked your nose in this. - You played the hero, now you start talking. - He doesn't know where it is. My partner and me stashed that gold long before the doc joined up with us. I don't know where it is but if I did know and I want to keep on living... the last thing I'd do is tell you Mccracken. But there's something else I want to tell you. I've been itching to pull down on you for about... The gold, where is it? One thing is for sure, you use that thing again and you ain't never going to find out. Real smart one. Yeah, smart enough to know the longer I hold out, the longer I live. You talk. We got plenty of time, you talk. Get me a hide. Stop that laughing and get me a hide, I'll meet you at the river. I got a little treat for you alright kid, get up. Yeah, the wetter they are, the more they'll stretch. That's good, just the way I like them. This is an old Indian trick. You ever see strips of green hide shrink up around a man when they dry out good? For one last time, where you hide it? Go to hell. Get his hands, pull them over his head. Hank, get his feet. Look, got his chest all swell up with wind... like a horse when you go to pull his cinch tight. Pull them up good, the less slack there is, the less they'll have to shrink... and the quicker we'll get this over. There's too much shade here. Got to get him out where the sun will be working on him all the time. Over there on that rock. We'll stake him out, he can bake real good. Take it easy kid. Might hurt yourself twisting like that. Better give him a swallow of water Frank. His tongue is so swollen up he couldn't talk now if he wanted to. We got no idea to kill valuable men like you. - That's enough. - Yeah, we don't want him to sweat. He ain't got enough sweat left in him to soften them strips. - Good and hard, getting tight too. - They'll get tighter. But not quite enough to kill you. That water tasted pretty good, didn't it kid? You can have all you want, you know. Just tell us where it's hid. Me and the boys just been swimming down in the river. Sloshing that water over us, cool and wet. How you like that? Come on, let's get off this frying pan, it's too hot here for me. Yeah. Alright, drop it. Come out with your hands up. I'll blow his head off. I ain't waiting, drop it. Ain't this nice? Now I got both partners and you've done me a favor to boot. It's a one-way split now, I'm the one. - You look like a reasonable man. - Don't count on it. Well, you'd better be, either you lead me to that gold or I'll blow his head off. I'll take you. I said you were a reasonable man, cut him loose. It's up there in those rocks. Alright, you big man, get down. Move up the hill. Right there, on your belly. On your belly. Now raise your hands. Alright, up the hill. - It's behind that boulder. - Alright, move it. It took two of us to put it there, I'll need help. You're big enough, you move it. Come on, move it, move it. - I can't, I told you I need help. - You move it or you're a dead man. My leg, get it off of me. Get it off, get it off of me. I need help. Get it off, my leg. Get it off. Help me, don't just leave me here. Help me. Help me, help me. Please please get it off. Please. Get it off me. Don't leave me, get it off of my leg. Die rich. Don't leave me, don't leave me here. Amigos, Gondora must've a little pleasure too. The buzzards, they will not have to wait for this one. And now, like Gondora promised, I give you safe passage. Ah, it's just a short ride to Seven Saints, we'll make it just fine. Yeah, thanks all the same, be sure to give Tita our love. Tell her we'll be back. Do not bother my friend, I've changed my mind. Gondora keep this little Chiquita for himself. You wish maybe to make the objection? Oh, not at all, I'm sure you'll both be very happy, she's a wonderful girl. - And you Rainbolt? - No objections. That's good, very good. And now my friends, we say goodbye, eh? Adios amigos. - Adios. - Adios. One minute. You forget something, you forget to leave the gold. Leave the gold? - Why, I thought we were friends Gondora? - Si. But that was yesterday. - What we do now? - Get the hell out of here. Don't shoot. Nothing. Nothing. Hey Gondora, you wanted the gold? Well, help yourself, it's right back in the river where it came from. Gold, she's lost, eh? That is very sad. But now we are friends again. Next time you come through this territory you be the guest of Gondora, eh? Only next time, bring only furs, save much trouble that way. Adios. Well, easy come, easy go, eh? Hey Shawn... Maybe we're kind of lucky at that... we still got that line of traps waiting for us back there. That's true, yeah and a pretty good pack horse as well. Yeah. If we get started, we got a chance at getting in a pretty good season. Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I was saying, let's get started. - We'll, we're dirt-poor again. - Yeah and you know something? - It feels kind of good for a change. - Yeah. ♪ I'm a lad who loves the girls, Oh, that is true. ♪ ♪ And there's nothing for dears I wouldn't do. ♪ ♪ But when they talk of marriage of rings and baby carriage... ♪ ♪ Then I find it's time to say a fond adieu. ♪
