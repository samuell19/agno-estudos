Come on, Jerry, up and at them. Oh, no. What time is it, Winch? Seven-thirty. It can't be. It's still dark out. Hey, that's right. It's usually light by 7:30. I guess the clock is wrong. Oh, well, you can go back to sleep. Thanks, Winch. That's funny. The clock has never been wrong before. But it sure is dark out. Boy, it's pitch-black. Well, I guess I'll let in some fresh air. How do you like that little character? He painted the window black so I'd think it was still night out. - [ Jerry. - ] Jerry! Don't holler. Well, then rise and shine. Remember, the early bird catches the worm. Yech! I don't like worms. Wake me up for toast and coffee. No, no, you don't. No. Don't go back to sleep. Now, look, you. You've been late for school twice this week. Now, come on. Let's go. Oh, I'm so tired. That's too bad. Come on now. You just get washed and hurry along. I guess I'll put on the coffee. There. Ah! Ought to be ready in a minute or two. Jerry. Hey, Jerry, hurry up, will ya? I wanna get washed too. Jerry? Jerry! Don't holler. Don't holler. How did you get back in bed? It's easy. When I came out of the bathroom, I made a left turn at the dresser. Jerry, I don't understand. Every day it gets harder and harder to get you out of bed. Now, come on, you've got to get washed and you've got to go to school. Yeah, but... Nevermind buts. Just get in there, and hurry it up, will you? Oh, that kid. Every day, every day the same thing. Jerry. Jerry! Don't holler. Now, look, you. Look, you, you come with me. You see, I've had enough of this nonsense. Now, into the closet. Come on. Take off your pajamas and put on your clothing. And hurry it up, young man. I wanna see a little speed. Hmm-hmm. That's what I call speed. You ready, Jerry? Jerry? Oh, no, not again. Jerry. Jerry? Now, where did he go... Jerry! Don't holler. Look, you, come on with me. You and I are going to have breakfast. Look, you, if you don't start showing some energy, you're gonna do very, very badly in school. I don't think I'm gonna do so hot anyway. Why not? Well, we got a couple of tests today. On what? On how the world began. You don't know how the world began? Well, it was a little bit before my time. Very funny. Well, it's a little late now, but perhaps I can explain it to you fast. Now, in the very beginning, everything was darkness. Darkness. Darkness. Then suddenly there was light. Then came the first image of man. Hey, Moe, wait! Spread out. Oh, a wise guy, eh? And then came water. Water, water, and more water. Oh. Come on, get up. Get out of here. What do you think this is, a camping ground? Close it up. Come on, get that out of here. Yeah, we'll get it. In there. That's all for today. How many of you guys are riveters? - Here we are. - Here, here. At your service, buddy. Three of the best riveters that ever riveted. Okay, we pay one dollar an hour. Pal, you just hired yourself three good men. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where do we start? On the 97th floor. Ninety-seventh floor? Hop on that girder and get up to work. Hurry up, lame-brain. Hey, what's that thing? In case we got to bail out. Hey, Moe. Oh. Don't ever do that, you dummy. Get them while they're hot. Bucker up. Bucker up. Push it! We put three new riveters on this section, Mr. Blake. Well, how are they working out? I haven't checked on them yet. Well, it looks like good solid construction. You know, you fellows... Oh! Solid construction, eh? Where are those three new men? Well, they've been working up above there. They... What do you mean by hiring men like them? A hot one right off the griddle. Oh, you dummy. Oh! Get those men off of this building! Go on, hurry up! Come on, I hope that parachute works. Open the parachute. Open it out, open it out. Knucklehead. Say, Jerry left already. You'd better hurry or you'll be late for school. Oh, I ain't going to school, Mr. Winchell. Oh, you too? Listen, Knuck, let's talk about it, shall we? What is it? Oh, ain't no use, sir. They can't teach me nothing. Knucklehead. Hmm? They can't teach me anything. Oh, you must be stupid too, huh? Look, what seems to be the trouble? Well, it's all this here homework I got to do. Oh? Let me see it. Right here. Oh, well, they just want you to write a composition about George Washington. Mmm-hmm. You know who George Washington was? Oh, certainly. He used to stand like this. No. That was Napoleon. No. Washington. Knucklehead, when did Washington ever stand like that? When he was wearing itchy underwear. Oh. Look, why don't we try a little simpler subject? Now, tell me, how are you with arithmetic? Oh, great, just terrific. There's only one thing I don't know. What's that? What's arithmetic? All right, we'll do something very, very easy. Now, tell me, how much is one and one? Uh... Could you give me a hint? All right. Hold up a finger. Okay. How much is that? Uh, one. Now, hold up another finger. Okay. And how much is that? Eleven. Just put down one finger. All right. Now, what have you got? Uh, I got a hangnail. Have you got a scissors, sir? Oh, please. Oh, Knucklehead, you're completely exasperating, frustrating and incorrigible. Gee, I wish you'd tell that to my mother. She thinks I'm a jerk. Oh, no. Oh, it's no use, Mr. Winchell. I'm hopeless. Oh, don't say that, Knucklehead. Nobody is hopeless. Look, let me tell you a little story. I once... Oh. I once knew three fellows. Yeah? And, well, they weren't too bright, but they were gas station attendants, you see. Uh-huh. Well, one day a big car pulled up for service. What will it be, stranger? Put in 10 gallons of gas. I'm going across the street for a sandwich. Well, I guess we might as well have lunch here, gentlemen. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, can you give me a little help? I need some repairs. We're pretty busy, pal, but we'd be glad to let you use the tools. Save us from working on the job. All right, men, a little super service. You check the battery, you check the tires. What are you gonna check? I'm gonna check you guys. Right. All right, all right. Right up there. Come on. We'll worry about that later. Shut it off! Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Please. Are you hurt? Are You all right? Get up out of there. Don't stand around idle. You put in the water, you put in the gas. Get moving. Right. Sorry, gents, but this can happen on the best places. Now, hold still now. Just a minute, I'll have a towel right away. Hey, stop that. Just take it easy, fellas. What happened? It's murder. It's arson. Let's get out of here. Hey, Curly, come on. Hey, Moe, Larry, wait. Let's get out of here. - Curly. - Hey, Curly! Open the door. Hey, Curly! He's frozen. Get him out of there. Oh, a frozen dainty, eh? Wait, he's stiff as a plank. What are you gonna do with him? We'll build fire under him and then thaw him out. Come on, get him into the woods. Put your arm under here. Okay. Up we go. Twenty minutes to a pound. What happened? Get me off of here. Untie me. He's burning, Moe. And he's done. Get him, will you? I got... Easy, kid. Easy now, kid. Wait a minute. He's gonna pass out. Easy, kid. Well, wait a minute. Stay right there. Are you all right? Take it easy, kid. Come here. Give me your hand. Give him a hand. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. All right, we've got you. Well, Jerry's in school and I'm all about myself at last. No trouble, no mischief, no noise. This silence is driving me out of my mind. Oh, well, he'll be home soon. Say, what's that sign on his dresser? "Open drawers at your own risk." Ooh! Ow. Ooh! Ooh! Just like that kid to have this booby-trapped. Oh, God! Jerry! What am I yelling for? He's not here. Aw. Jerry's baby picture. Gee, he was a cute little baby. Oh, what's the matter, sweetheart? Oh, come on, up we go, up we go. Oh, yes, indeed. Our little baby wants some foody, doesn't he? Come over here and great big Daddy will give him some food, all right? Get out of here. Oh. Isn't that cute? Now, here's some nice foodsy-woodsy. Come on, sweetheart, open your mouth. No. Come on.

Oh. That came all the way up from your toesies, you sweet little baby. That came up from your toesies, you phony ventrikolist. Jerry, was that nice? I'm sorry, Dada. Dada. He called me Dada. Oh, no, no, no. Oh. Hey. That's a real baby crying. I wonder where that's coming from. Where's that cat? I'll murder it. Kitty, kitty, kitty. What do you know? A baby. Oh. A lovely baby.

Don't cry, honey. There we are. Boy, there we go. There we are. Okay. Hey, where are you? Here, here. Oh, there you are. Boys, all we need is a few slight alterations. Stand by, Doc. Scissors. Scissors. Pin. Pin. Scissors. Pin. Pin. - Pin. - Pin. Pin. Pin. Wait till you see the meal we have for you. Come on. There we are. There's enchiladas, spaghetti, artichokes, onions, celery, olives, radishes, pig's feet and herring. Come on, get going. Here we are, ready or not. Look, a nice radish. Try an olive. Oh! Get a load of these headlines. "Police scour city for kidnapped baby." Oh, that's nothing. Kids get into mischief. Now, when I was a kid, I... Kidnapped? Who? What? When? Let me see. There. "Police fear kidnappers have grabbed "Collins' baby and are holding it for ransom. "So far the kidnappers have not contacted the family." The kidnappers got cold feet and left us with a kid with a phony note. Hey, bunion head, answer that door. Hey, fellas, it's the cop. They're after us for kidnapping. We got to hide the evidence. Let me see now. The window. Scram. Where are they? Say, there must be pigeons in this car. Yeah. It's the baby. It's in the car. Now we're in for it. Everything will be all right as long as the kid keeps quiet. I'll cut a hole in the canvas and see where cops are. Good idea, and if you see them, let me know. Hmm. Hey, there's somebody out here honking his horn. Yeah, it's you, you dope. Get off. I'm gonna get those guys. All right. Spread out, I got to signal for a turn. Get your gun, they may be violent. Stick them up. Stick them up. Baby. Oh, my baby. Darling. My baby. I'm sorry we quarreled last night. Me too. I was so despondent. That's why I left Jimmy on that doorstep. Well, don't worry, it won't happen again. No. Say, what do you suppose became of those three goofs? You got me. They still don't know that all we wanted was the baby. Yeah. Say, I didn't realize it was that late. I better call the garage and see if my car has been fixed yet. Acme garage. Mulligan speaking. Mr. Mulligan, this is Winchell. Paul Winchell. Is my car ready? You know, the one I borrowed from my army friend. You said it would be fixed today. Hang on, Mr. Winchell. Hey, Charlie. Check on Mr. Winchell's car, will you? Hey. Go away, I'm busy. Burglars. Oh, I didn't know it was you, Moe. Come on out of that car. Get up there and take care of the motor. Help! Get me out! Help! What are you doing down there, Moe? Get me out. I'm suffocating. Come on, we got to get him out. It's no use. We can't get him out this way. Wait a minute. Maybe this will help. It's no use. Oh. The anvil. Let's break it off. Get me out of here, will you, fellas? Take your time. Take your time. Now, look, lay it right down there like that. Oh, no, no, take it easy. Four! Oh! Say, if we heat it, it'll slip off. Why didn't I think of that? Come on, let's get going. Okay. Okay. I'll murder you guys. I'm burning up. That ought to be hot enough. It's too hot. Let's put it in the water and cool it off. Help! Help! Hey, let's put his head in the vice and yank it off. Whoa! Wait a minute. Got you out, didn't we? Without even hurting the pipe. Yeah. I'll murder you guys. Hey, Moe, look out. Look out, Moe. You'll break the hammer. I'll bust your skull. Well, this is the last thing in there and still no squeak. What does a squeak look like? Well, they're usually a small... Why you, jugheads. You'll never get this thing together in time. Hey, here comes Kelly. I'll stall him off while you guys get the parts back in. Looks pretty good. Say, that windshield looks so clean you wouldn't know there was any glass in it. You said it. Did you get that squeak out? Boy, we got everything out. I'll drive it right out. Now, wait a minute, Kelly, listen, there's one thing that I... Never mind. I'm in a hurry. Sounds good. Hello, uh, Mr. Winchell? Oh, yes. Is my car finished? It's finished, Mr. Winchell, but it ain't ready. Okay. So long. Oh, boy, oh boy, look at all this food. Well... I'm glad you like it, Jerry. Well, everything is ready. Oh, am I hungry, Winch. Am I hungry. No, no. Hmm? No. Watch your manners. Stop reaching. What's the matter with you? Haven't got a tongue? Yeah, but my arm is longer. Oh, here, have a piece of corn. Oh, thanks, Winch. But eat it like a gentleman. Yes, sir. Gently. Mmm-hmm. Sweetly. Mmm-hmm. Lovingly. Tenderly. I'll just kiss it and put it back. Oh, go ahead and eat it. Can you stop long enough to answer one question? Oh, sure. What is it, Winch? How did you do in school today? I got 100 in everything. You did? Oh, Jerry, I'm so thrilled. I... Are you telling me the truth? No, but I sure had you living there for a while. Oh, no. And this afternoon, it's even gonna be worse. Why? She's gonna ask questions about Mexico. Mexico? Mmm-hmm. Well, I can help you there. You can? Certainly. Now let's see. Mexico is a beautiful country. Mmm-hmm. Each year, thousands of people from all over the world come to see it's many wonders. Ladies and gentlemen, as an added attraction, we wish to present those loco Americanos comedians, The Three Stooges. They will do a comedy bullfight. We hope you like them too many. Thank you. Ha! To the fair queen of the fiesta, I dedicate this bull. And I do mean bull. Come on, fellas, let's get going. Come on, what are you stalling for? Get going. They're waiting for something. Come on, charge me. Charge me. Now you're working, fellas. The act is going over great. Look at that audience. Hey, what are you doing over there when you belong over here? You think... Help me! That was a close call, kid. He almost got you. It's all your fault. Three months we waited for a break for this act, and you come along and ruin it. I'm mad! I'm furious! Fight like a man. Come on, Jerry, hurry up. You'll be late for this afternoon's class. This afternoon's class. Boy, oh boy, if I flunked the test this morning, I hate to think what I'll do this afternoon. If Winch thought that I was sick, then he wouldn't send me. This'll do it. Now, I'll just put one over here. Another one there... Listen, Jerry, didn't you hear me? Now come on, you got to get to school this after... Why are you covering your face? Jerry. Hmm? Your face. Yech. What are you yeching about? Well, it's all covered with dots. What do you expect? Dashes? Well, what is it? Chicken pox. Chicken pox. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. Listen. Yeah, but it can't be chicken pox. The spots are only on your face. That's the worst kind. From the neck down I've got feathers. Jerry, if you've got chicken pox, then I can't send you to school. What? I must go to school if it kills me. No, I can't let you go. I must go. I can't let you go. I must. I can't... Well... Keep fighting me, keep fighting me. Here. Wait a minute. I'll take your temperature. I'll get a thermometer. Who needs it? Here. Open your mouth. Yeah, but I... Open it. Open your mouth, I say. What's the matter? Watch the mechanism. Oh, here, put it back. Put it back. I'll get you some hot tea. I'll get you some hot tea. Uh-oh. It's normal. What'll I... Ah. He-he. This ought to do it. ♪ You give me fever, fever ♪ Now you drink this, you'll feel better. Uh-oh. Uh... Hey. Hey. I said that thermometer in. Yeah, but you don't seem to... I said in. Now, what does it say? Two hundred and sixty-four. Two hundred and sixty-four. Two hundred and sixty-four? Jerry, I'd better get the doctor. Wait a second, Winch. Wait a second. What's the matter? I'm going fast. What? This is it. So long, old pal. Jerry, wait a minute, hang on. So long. I'm going to die. I'm dead. You're not dead, you're alive. You call this living? Jerry. Winch, it's getting dark. Jerry, what's the matter? Hold on. It's getting dark. I can't see you. Turn the lights on. Where are you? The lights are on. Don't you see me now? Yeah. Turn them off again. Oh, I better get the doctor, that's what I'll do. I'll get the doctor. I'll call the hospital. The hospital, yes. What's the number? Oh. The hospital. My baby. My poor little Garcon. Oh, calm yourself, Mrs. Bedford. He's in the hands of the world's greatest specialists. They'll pull him through. I hope so. Do you think it's serious, Dr. Curly? Yes, indeed, to say the least if not less. Hmm. The perambulation of the pedal extremity is impeded by the insertion of a foreign botanical offshoot. Now, gentlemen, we must proceed with caution. This Bedford dog is worth a fortune. So it is. The instruments. The instruments. Instruments. Instruments. Ah, tools. Accalophone. Accalophone. Accalophone. Pickleadickletar. Go get a pickleadickletar. We have none. We have none. Oh, yes, we have. Hold it, Doctor. This is gonna hurt me worse than it does you, Garcon. Hold on. Success. Success. Success. How is Garcon? Is she all right? The operation was a complete success. That's wonderful. Now I can show Garcon in the dog show tomorrow. Come, Garcon. No, no. He must rest here for a few hours. Yes. We'll have her back about 4:00. Well, see that Garcon gets the very best of attention. Oh, yes, madam. Thank you. Good day, gentlemen. Good day. Oh! Nurse. Put the dog to bed. Dr. Moe, Dr. Larry, Dr. Curly. What do you want? Two important visitors to see you. Okay. Hey, that nurse must have eaten catnip. Ah! Oh. One little kitten lost its mitten. How careless. Here they come now. How do you do, gentlemen? We're from The Daily Star. We'd like to get up a feature story about your hospital. That's fine. Follow us. We'd be happy to show you around. Here's an interesting case, gentlemen. What's wrong with him? He's suffering from acute alcoholism. Ain't he a cutie. He's a lap dog. A lap dog? Yeah, he lapped up two cases of beer. A bad case. Keep a cool head, kid. Now, right this way, gentlemen. Dr. Moe, Dr. Larry, Dr. Curly. Who's Garcon? That's Mrs. Bedford's prize poodle. Oh. Calling Dr. Curly. Calling Dr. Curly. Calling Dr. Larry. Calling Dr. Larry. Calling Dr. Moe. Pomeranian, ward six, has a coat on its tongue. What should we do? Give him the pants and vest and take him for a walk. Pardon me. Come on, we gotta pull this job in a hurry. We'll hide him in the old house until we get the ransom. Hmm. Calling all curs. Calling all curs. Dinner is ready. Come to the dining room. That is all. Don't worry. There's enough for everybody. Take a look at this. Dr. Moe. Larry. Curly. Garcon is missing. Come at once. Hurry. Garcon! Garcon! By Garcon! Oh, what'll we do? Read this note. What happened? Where's Garcon? He's gone! Here. Read this note. "Mrs. Bedford can have her dog if she pays $2000. "Don't tell the cops or she'll never see him again." Those guys weren't reporters, they were dognappers. I got an idea. I wonder what he's up to? Sit down there. Now, here's the idea. We got to disguise this mutt to look like Garcon. The old lady won't know the difference. Get to work on that mattress. Nurse, get the glue. You get the black paint. Start pulling, boys. He looks more like Garcon than Garcon. Nobody will ever recognize him. That mattress here turned the trick. We brought Mr. Bedford's dog back. All right. But keep it away from me. I don't like dogs. Come on. Come on. This way. Right in here, gentlemen. The madam will be right in. Whoa. Go away, dog! Go away! You is scalped! I'm getting out of here. How do you do, doctors? Well, where is Garcon? Right here. Garcon! Hey, Garcon. Hey, Garcon. Hey, Garcon. Garcon! Garcon! Here. Hey, Garcon? That's not my dog! She's fainted. Get something. Do something. All right, don't worry. You fiends! You vandals! What have you done with my dog? I'm sorry, lady. We made a mistake. You get my dog back or I'll have the police on you. We'll bring him back. Alive. You'd better. Garcon! Hey. Garcon! Garcon! I tell you, the jig is up, boys. I can see us in jail. Yeah, on a rock pile, making little ones out of big ones. Listen, blood hound, if you've got any blood in you, you'll find Garcon. Now, go on, do your stuff. Look, he's gonna find him. Come on. He sees something. He's calling us. Why don't he make up his mind? Quiet. We'll find out. Come on. I wonder why we haven't heard from the owner of that dog? Search me. Come on, he's on a scent. We're looking for a dog. He had four legs and a tail. No, I ain't see no dog. It's them! The dognappers. Come on. Get him, Moe. Hold still! Give it to him. Give it to him. Sock him. In the chin! Oh! Ah! I'll get him. Wait a minute. Let me at him, Al. I'll mop up the floor with him. It's Garcon. He's in the closet. Come on. Success! Don't worry, Jerry. Everything will be all right. Why don't those doctors show up. Oh, I know what I'll do. I'll get you a cold compress. Yeah. That will cool off your head a little bit. Here. Here. Just, doesn't that feel good? There, doesn't that... Uh-oh. Faking, huh? Just to stay home from school. Now wait a second, Winch. Don't you "wait a second" me. You're gonna be punished. Now, you go to school right now. But I can't. It's too late. Well, then, go in the other room, and do your homework. I ain't got it. Well, Knucklehead has got it. I'll go right over to Knucklehead's house right now. And I'll get your homework. But Knucklehead ain't home right now. He's working over at his uncle's restaurant. All right. Then I'll go right over to his uncle's restaurant and I'll get the homework right now. Your coffee's great, Knucklehead. Thanks a lot. How much do I owe you? Oh, for you, Officer Joe, no charge. So long. So long. I'll see you in court. That's a funny one. See you in court. What a guy. Hi. Howdy. Hi, Knucklehead. Oh, hello there, Mr. Winchell. What can I do for you? Well, may I borrow Jerry's homework assignment for today? Oh, certainly. I got it right here, sir. Thank you. Here it is, right here. Oh, good. Listen, while you're here, would you like something to eat? All right, Knucklehead. Give me a salad. Yes, siree. One salad coming up. Oh, is that a tossed salad? Hmm? I like a tossed salad. Would you toss it for me? Well, if that's what you want. Please. Ah! Knucklehead. Huh? Look, just make me a sandwich, please. Okay. One sandwich coming up. On raisin bread, if you don't mind. Oh, of course I don't mind. Not at all. Oh, is that raisin bread fresh? Why, certainly. Uh-oh. What's the matter? What'd you do that for? One of the raisins was walking. Oh, for goodness... There's your homework. Get busy. Hey, Winch. Can I do it later? Later? Yeah. My favorite TV show is on now. Well, okay. I guess another half hour can't do any harm. It's a lie! Come on, let's get the horses. Come on. Hold it. Hey, don't drive so fast. They're way behind. Why didn't you wait for me? Here they come! Quick, the shack. I'll tell them we're not home. Let the bar down. Come on, let them have it. We gotta get some guns, boys. Come on. Ooh, eats! There's no gun, but there's a lot of bullets. Here's some belts. Feed them in now. Slow. Take it easy. Come on, men! Keep them covered, boys. Noble work, my men. Okay. You've seen your television show. Now, get busy and do your homework. Oh, gee whiz, Winch. I said do your homework. I'm gonna have some water. All right, all right. Gee, what a grouch. Hmm, that's funny. - Hey, Jerry. - Yeah? Would you do me a favor and let your homework go and come in here for a minute? Something's wrong with the faucet. It doesn't work. Okay, Winch. What is it? Oh, look, you see that little valve down there? This one? Mmm-hmm. When I say all right, will you turn it on, please? Okay. Oh, but not now. Just wait till I say all right, then turn it on. When you say all right, I turn it on. Yeah. Hey, Winch. Yeah? How's it coming? All right. What's the big idea? Well, you said all right. Hey, Winch. Yeah? How come this other valve is green? Green? Oh, that's just a little corrosion. Yeah? Yeah. They're both supposed to be all white. Look, you. I said all white! I didn't say all... Look. Do me a favor. Don't touch anything, will you, please? Leave everything alone. I'll go call the plumbers. Plumbers, plumbers. Sorry, Winch. Let's see. Well, Winch? No answer. They must be out on a job. Just a second! Let me have that wrench, you imbeciles. Oh, oh, oh. ♪ I hear the voice Of spring of you ♪ Hey, boys, I must be dead.

I'm having a few guests in tonight for a musical party. You must come and sing for them. Oh, well, now that's a problem. I'll pay you $500 if you come. We'll be there with bells on. Splendid. Ladies and gentlemen, I've the honor of presenting the great artist... SenoritaCucaracha, SenorMucho, and SenorGusto. Father, I'm sure I know those men. Hey, look who's here. Oh, Mrs. Bixby. I'm so sorry I'm late. I meet some crazy peoples. They bust my fiddle, they bust my glasses. We better get out of here. If he spots us, we're cooked. Come on. My glasses, all broke. It's a good thing he ain't got glasses. Maybe he won't know us. All we gotta do is knock them dead with your song, we're in. Just be careful with that record. Nothing's gonna happen to it. Well, it might get broke. Not with me handling. Just be careful. Shut up! Oh! With me handling the record, nothing... Look what you did. Now we're cooked. No, we ain't. Look. There's a lot of records. You're getting half a brain in your skull now, huh? "Sextetfrom Lucy." Can you sing it? I can't even say it. Oh, go on. Get set. Oh, short eyeballs, eh? Oh, the "Sextetfrom Lucia." My goodness, what happened? The senorita has lost her voice. Wait. Why did you take my record from the broadcasting station? I wanted that job and you spoiled my chances of getting it. Now, the least thing you can do is to go through with it. I want to prove something to my father. How can we? My voice? I mean, your voice is broken? No, it isn't. It's as good as new. Listen. Oh, my dear, you were wonderful. You'll sing for us now, won't you? Of course, she will. Won't you? Do that number you did at the broadcasting station this afternoon. Play Voices Of Spring. This way, senorita. All set? ♪ I hear the voice Of spring and you ♪ ♪ And the birds return The skies are blue ♪ Ha-ha! Look, peoples, just a big fake. This is unnecessary. Throw them in jail. Oh, please, please, wait. It wasn't all their fault. I helped them. Why, Alice? Oh, I wanted to prove I was good enough to get a job, Father. And you are, dear. As for these impostors... Hey, Winch. Yeah, Jerry? Any luck yet? No, I still can't get the plumbers. Hey, go out in the front yard and shut the water off. Hey, what's going on here? Hey! Hey! Turn me loose! Ah! Ah! I got it. Ah! Ah! I gotta get this water out.

Get another piece of pipe. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, the end of the line. Hurry up with that pipe! Okay! Here we go. Straighten her up now so I can line her up. This house has sure gone crazy. I'll find this thing or else... If it wasn't for me, where would we be? This is station WX21 making a television broadcast direct from Niagara Falls. There. I hope you sleep tight, Knuck. Say, Mr. Winchell... Yeah? You know, at home, I never go to sleep unless my father tells me a story. Oh, really? What kind of a story does he tell ya? Well, he tells me Robinson Crusoe and his man, Saturday. You mean Friday. No, Saturday. He overslept. Say, how would you like to hear the story of Cinderella? Oh, that's swell. All right. Now, let's see. Once upon a time, when knighthood was in fame, there lived a pretty slavy. Cinderella was her name. Dearest sister, will we ever marry a handsome Mister? Oh, it's so hard to be beautiful. This perfume should capture a male. Where's Cinderella? Our sister is never around when we need her. Cinderella! You didn't wash. You didn't scrub. You didn't dust. Or clean the tub. You didn't cook. You didn't sew. Get to work.

Then off he glanced and was entranced as the golden coach he spied. As from the coach she did alight, the graceful prince fell in love at first sight. You're scintillating, fascinating, devastating. The prince never asked us to dance. In fact, nobody asked us. The stroke of midnight did approach. Hurry, Cinderella, hurry! Hurry, before the coach turns into a pumpkin. Alas, poor graceful prince, he was shortchanged in the deal. His lady fair had won his heart, but lost her sole and heel. Farewell, my fair lady. Oh, sadness. Oh, sorrow. Joy today, gloom tomorrow. Hello, pumpkin. Farewell, coach. The prince had lost his lady love, he knew not what to do. And so he sought the dainty foot to fit the crystal shoe. Oh, darling, what big toes you have. Cinderella, open the door. The prince. He mustn't see me like this. Extend your feet in the name of the king. For the foot that fits the slipper should belong to the leg of my queen. Here, let me try it. Here, Prince. Here, Prince. Here, Prince. It's impolite to point. It fits! My heart, my love, my queen! My foot. My bride. Esmeralda. Gee. Don't cry, Zelda.

I gotta finish and find out who the killer is. Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, you'll have to turn out that light. We gotta get to sleep. Oh, gee whiz, Winch. Just let me read one more chapter, huh? Well, all right. You read one more chapter, but I've gotta get some sleep. Gee whiz. He's out like a light. I think I'll finish my milk. Now let's see. "The killer walked in with gun in hand. "'Stick them up, ' he said. "'Higher. Higher. Higher.'" Oh, the damn is busted. Run for the hills. The... Winch! Now, look you, I've had enough of this nonsense. Now, give me that book. Now, you turn out the light and got to sleep. Gee whiz, don't get sore. Don't get sore? Let's turn it out. Now, good night, Jerry. Good night. Okay, okay. Good night. What's that? What's all that noise? They're having a party next door. At 2:00 in the morning. Oh, this is ridiculous. No, thank you, Sapington. Good evening. Good evening. May I introduce my three proteges. Mr. Gotrocks. Delighted. Devastated. Dilapidated. And the Countess Shpritzvasser? Enchanted. Enraptured. Embalmed. Oh, pardon us. Quaint, aren't they, but cute. Good evening, Miss Lulu.
