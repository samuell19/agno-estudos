Alright, let's go now, hustle up. Hey Matt, standing in that water ain't good for a cold. What if? - Eddie. - How is it going man? The trouble with that little old boy is he just don't realize the honeymoon is over. So I said, Man, if you want to sell me a car, you going to have to really sell it to me. Then I'm just sitting back and watching. Yes sir. That's telling him boy, you working too hard again Jerry. Thank you, will you be able to make it for lunch? Well, I got a date with a couple of bullets out of this guy's chest. May take 30 or 40 minutes, yeah, I guess I can make it. Don't waste any time because I'm real hungry. Where you want to go? Where you want to eat? I don't know, that place down the street is Ok, I kind of like their spaghetti. - Yeah, that's him. - I figured we might try a rendezvous again. You interested in food or talking that waitress? Oh no, you don't pin on me Kleber, you're the guy she really went for. Maybe... but I don't know how she ever saw me the way you kept sticking your elbow in my face. Ok, Ok, you win. We'll try the spaghetti. Ok? Hey Kleber, Ok? Maybe not. This may take a little longer than I thought. All right, I'll wait for you. That the foreigner they just brought in Kleber? - Yeah, better stay away from him. - Got to tag him. I said stay away from him. - What's the matter? I got to tag him. - Look, stay away from him, get out of here. - What's wrong? You're acting like... - Just stay out. - What's the matter with you? - Stay out. You're holding the brush wrong Pop. - Oh? - Yeah and you got too much paint on it. - How is that? - Better. Thank you. Mr. Redfield says that's the worst thing you can do to get too much paint on the brush. Is that right? Why don't you let me do it for you? Ok. You better take it easy now, you don't want get paint all over those pants. - Hi you Tommy. - Hi Mr. Redfield. - Teaching your pop how to paint? - Sure. - Hello Doctor. - How are you? - Great boy you have there. - Thank you, thank you. - See you Saturday Mr. Redfield. - Sure, sure, anytime you like. If things get dull, just drop right on over, hear? Bye. - Who's that? - Mr. Redfield, he's a painter. Yeah, so I gathered. He lives in the big house down on the corner. You ought to see it Pop... it's full of all kinds of stuff and he has electric trains and everything. Must be great. Hey, you know what I think is the matter with this stuff? - What? - Too thick. - No. - It's too thick, look at it. I'm going to thin it, find the turpentine. - Electric trains yet. - Clint? - Clint, telephone. - Not here. - It's Gafney from the office. - Tell him I went to Alaska. He's waiting Clint. Oh, bosh. - What's your problem? - Pop, can I have a quarter? - What happened to your allowance? - It's for the movies Pop. All the kids are going. Oh, come on Pop. Now look old boy, you're supposed to get 50 cents a week. Ah Pop, money just goes, you know how it is. Yeah, I got a pretty good idea. Take it, you're a pest. - Thanks Pop, I knew you would. - Yeah, I knew it too. The first day I've had off in 6 weeks. I just about get used to it when the phone rings. What am I supposed to be anyhow? The only one in that office that knows what to do? - Tell Gafney, he called, not me. - I should've had it disconnected. Paul? I thought I told you I was going to take the whole day off. Yeah. What do you mean there's something funny about him? Yeah? Well, alright, I'll come down. Hold everybody there that had any contact with the body in case it is something. No, I'd rather you stayed there. Yeah, I know, it's all right. Serious? No, it's always a crisis with those boys when they can't diagnose something. I don't suppose that cleaner remembered to bring back my... - Well, what happened to him all of a sudden? - Go ahead and change, I'll bring it in. Hey, Mom, isn't lunch ready yet? I'm hungry. You and your father. And Al Jerio asked me to go hunting today with him down in the bayous. I know, I know, what's the rush? Got to meet the kids, we're going to a movie. Movie? What are you planning to use for money? Oh, I got it. No, but told me just going to stay home, lie around all day. Not going to shave, just slop around. - Old clothes, drink a couple... - Oh, Mom. Now what? Take a little nap in the afternoon, have an early dinner, just take the whole day off. - Relax, you know what I mean? - You give Tommy a quarter for the movies? Well, yeah. Weren't you the one that decided to give him a regular allowance to teach him about money? Well, yeah, I did honey, but you see... Look, he may be an only child but I'm not going to have him act like one, here. I gave you the answer to that one two years ago. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm getting tired of always being the heavy in the piece. Ok, Ok. Incidentally, since you're being so free with your money... What? Holy smoke. The bill from Whitfield's. - The same one. - What happened to your allowance? You're kidding, of course. - 42 dollars and I'm fresh out. - Again? Still and you've been promising to pay it Clint. It's getting embarrassing really, I'm afraid to go down to the store. What? For 42 dollars? Let them wait. I never saw the day old Massa Whitfield would broke his neck getting anything over here. 42 dollars. Listen, one of these days we'll walk into that... - store and pay cash. - One of what days? Well, one of these days. When one of those oil companies decides that they... can't lay a pipeline in Arabia without the services of Dr. Clinton Reed. All right. The man with the high forehead and the disposition of an old... Honey? - Hey, Clint. - What? - I like high foreheads. - Yeah, I'll bet you do. Well, it happens, don't think it doesn't. They've taken a lot of guys from the department. Bill Mosely works for an industrial chemical company. - I know they have honey. - Well, could happen to me too. - Just like having that other baby. - One of these days, eh? You're a fresh dame. Pretty, though. You just about get by, I got to get out of here. - Hey. - What? Try and get in early if you can, won't you? Yeah, I'll try. Honey? Why don't you let Tommy have this quarter? Why don't you get out of here? - Bye. - Bye. - She took the quarter. - Yeah. Well, that's life, eh sport? - Well, I got to get to work. - Tommy dear. Don't sit through it more than twice, will you dear? - What you make of that tissue Ben? - I don't know, but I don't like it. This one is a specimen of his sputum and here's one of the bullets Kleber recovered. Now, let me see that slide. It's practically pure culture. - Get them away from that body. - Ok fellas, that's all, let's go. Just wait outside for a minute, will you fellas, with the others? - Any way to pull these shades? - Sure Doc. - Can you get this man cremated? - Well, I suppose. I don't want any supposing Ben, I want him cremated right now, set it up, will you? - Oh, Kleber. - Yes sir. I want everything that's touched him burned or sterilized. - Do you understand me? - Sure, Doc. Paul, get those slides into a sterilizer right away, will you? Right. Say, they sent over the serum and the streptomycin. Good. - Hey Kleber, what's going on around here? - Any report on who killed this man Sergeant? - No. - Any leads? No, I don't think so. Well, do you know or don't you? This is important. - Well, sure Doc. - Is anyone been able to identify the body? No sir, nobody. We sent the fingerprints off to the FBI, but we haven't heard anything from them yet. You got everybody here who had anything to do with the body? Yeah, the fingerprint men, photographers, patrolmen who found him. Nearly everybody. What you mean nearly? - There's Billy Hall, he... - Get him. - Now? - Yes, now, right away. Sure Doc. Call Billy Hall. Have him come down right away. - Now? - Yeah, right now. Thanks. Will you have these people line up please? - Alright, let's form a line fellows. - You ready Paul? Come on, shake it up here, press a line here. That is Dr. Reed from Government Health Service. This will only take a minute, as a... precautionary measure, we're going to inoculate all of you. So if you just take your coats off, roll up your sleeves. Hurry it up Paul, they'll start asking questions. - Oh, Kleber, would you mind helping out? - Ok, Doc. And thanks, was a fine job. You did just the right thing. - Appreciate it. - Thank you Doctor. Give them each two CCs. I fixed it to have him cremated. Swell. Help Kleber down at the end, will you Ben? - Start down at the other end. - Here's the alcohol. All right, let's get this over with quickly please. - Give me the first one Paul. - What's in them things Doc? - Nothing, just a little serum. - Serum for what? - I told you, precautionary measures. - Yeah, precautionary, but for what? Well, it's possible the dead man may have had some communicable disease. I don't have to take one of those shots. I can quarantine you for 10 days. Hold still or this is going to hurt. - Aside from isolated cases in... - Ok, I'll see you, Murph. The past 20 years there's been at least one major outbreak. In November of 1924 in Los Angeles, California... a woman died of what was thought to be pneumonia. Thirty-two people had had contact with her... and within four day sand within four days before the disease... could be correctly diagnosed and contained, 26 of them had died... and they died suddenly, violently, horribly. The disease was finally found to be pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is the pulmonary form of bubonic, the Black Death of the Middle Ages. - Its death incidence is practically 100%. - Who you say he was? I'm Dr. Reed of the United States Public Health Service. And one of the jobs of my department is to keep plague out of this country. Sit down, sit down, don't let me interrupt you. Speak to one of them about it, will you please? Come on Mary. The Dr. Reed filled you in on this? Are you finished Doctor? Well there's not much more Mr. Mayor. Bubonic plague, as you probably know, is spread by the rat flea... which is why we watch all ships and ports. Pneumonic, on the contrary, can be spread like a common cold... on the breath, sneezes, or sputum of its victims. Very interesting, but I don't quite see why we were called into this. Because this morning, right here in the city... your police found the body of a man who was infected with this disease. Well Dan, what about it? Our reports show the man died with two bullet wounds. He did, heart and lungs. Death was probably instantaneous, right Tom? Yes sir, we had a police surgeon... Regardless of what the police surgeon said, he would've died within 12 hours. But what he did die of was two bullet holes. He had pneumonic plague. - But he died of... - Drop it Tom. Dr. Mackey? As you know Mr. Mayor, I wasn't there. Ben was there when the body was brought in, but I can go now and check. - I had the body destroyed. - You had it destroyed? It was the prime source of contamination, I had Ben cremate it. - I see, what else have you done Mackey? - Why, I... Everyone who came in contact with the body is been inoculated... - everyone we know of... - That's right. With serum and streptomycin. And now, I think they ought to be isolated. We can have them watched, we know who they are, all but one... the man who killed him. - Or men. - Mr. Mayor, this man was shot. The killer wasn't within 10 feet of him and I can prove it. Was he shot on that riverbank Captain? Of course not, he was dumped off the Canal Street Pier about 5 o'clock, 5:30. How did he get to the Canal Street Pier? How do I know? Somebody must've... The point is that whoever dumped him... there may very well be walking around with incipient plague at this moment. Oh, no wait a moment. No, we've got to work on the supposition the doctor is right. Dan, looks like your job. All right sir, I'll do what I can. But after all, we don't know the identity of the dead man. - We have no possible idea of the motivation. - And you haven't got much time Mr. Quinn. Also, we haven't got the body. Did you empty out his pockets? - I'd everything burned. - Great. If the killer is incubating pneumonic plague he can start spreading it within 48 hours. - Forty-eight hours? - Yes, we have 48 hours. Shortly after that, you'll have the makings of an epidemic. Commissioner, what's the use of kidding ourselves? We can't turn up an unknown killer in two days. He's absolutely right Mr. Mayor. The police department can't be held responsible for this. Now, if you want to believe the doctor here, I'm sorry sir, but frankly, I honestly don't. But if you want to believe him there's only one way to handle this. Give the story to the press, you get on the radio... And have everybody who was in contact with the dead man leave town? You can't give it to the press. I may be an alarmist, I may be entirely... wrong about the whole matter but I've seen this disease work. And I'm telling you if it ever gets loose, it can spread over the entire country... and the result will be more horrible than any of you can imagine. And the key to the whole thing lies right here, now, in the next 48 hours. You can take me at my word, whatever you like. What can we do? - Find this man. - Dan, put your best men on it. - Yes sir. Tom, you work with the doctor. - Anything else you need, ask for it. - Mackey. - Thank you. - We'll give him all the assistance possible. - That's it gentlemen. All right Tom, make your arrangements with the doctor here. I'll be on call waiting for a report. Take any emergency action you feel necessary. Annapolis man? No. - Why? - No reason. - Hope I wasn't too rough. - On me? - No. - No, I meant the rest of them. Still have a feeling they don't believe me. I just know how serious this can be, I was trying to put it across to them. Now I'd start worrying about what... you're going to do when we don't turn up with your boy. Just a minute Captain. - Hi Cap. - Hello Josh. If this is the attitude you're going to start out with, we're not going to get far. Mr. Reed, I was assigned to this, I'll do the best I can. But let's not get the idea that I'm a sailor in your navy. - Now, wait a minute... - Hello Warren, I've been looking for you. You found me and you're interrupting me. - Heard you had a meeting. - Little pitchers. Had Mackey and the Board of Health in too, what's the score? Some complaints about your newspaper, we figure we ought to fumigate it. Now, now, you know you can't hide anything. When it breaks, I'll spell your name wrong. What I told them, we just ought to fumigate you. You boys worry me when you take off on your own. No sense in our both worrying, goodbye Neff. - Now, wait a second Warren. - Goodbye Neff. Where you going Mr. Reed? I don't know, that depends on you. Listen Doctor, I got a job to do... just a routine sort of thing, like rounding up every possible suspect. I'm supposed to be pretty good at my job, so why don't I call you if I need you? Are you implying you'd like to get rid of me Captain? - No, but... - Then I'll go with you. Come on. What you call that? - Hi Johnny. - Hello Mr. Neff, good seeing you. You call that a concealed weapon? You think you can hold me on this? Where were you with it last night? Last night? Why, I was home, shucking oysters. - What goes on here Charlie? - Who knows? Your wife says you didn't come home all night. She didn't come home all night, she don't know what she's talking about. I tell you I got a right to a lawyer, you can't just haul me in without a lawyer. Oh, why don't you shut up? You meet a lot of guys, you ever see this one? What kind of a crack is that? So I hang around the Roost once in a while. Does that make me an information bureau? Listen, buddy, I happen to be a personal friend of Charley Sweeney, see? And he ain't going to like this. Or maybe Charley Sweeney can tell me where you was at last night. Why don't you call him and find out? He'll have me out of here in 20 minutes. Well, for 20 minutes, you'll tell me where you was at last night. You can't do this to me, I'm a citizen and I got rights. Raymond Fitch, laundry attendant. 1943, petty larceny. 30 days. 1945, petty larceny. 90 days. - Shall I go any further? - No, forget it. Mind if I smoke? Trying to get away from cigarettes. Put it out. - You ever see this guy? - No, I never seen this guy. - Well, look. - I mean, I've never seen this guy. What? What are you asking me for? A kisser like that, you see it, you remember it, eh? - Where were you last night all night? - Last night? Last night? Oh yeah. I went to see my mother in law, she was wrestling semifinals... Where were you? I was only kidding. Actually... - me and my wife went to see a movie. - Where were you fat boy? - What's the matter? You don't believe me? - I think you're a constitutional liar. Lot of people have told me the same thing, I don't mind. Of course, the body was burned sir, so we don't have too much. The boys who did examine him, say he may be an Armenian, Czech or mixed blood. Approximate age, 42, height, 5' 9, weight, 143. Suit made in Haifa, shoes in Buenos Aires. You ought to notify the immigration authorities immediately. - Get rid of him. - All right. Keep going, Scott. Mobile, Tampa and other Gulf ports have no record of him sir. - Anything else? - Let's see. The FBI has no record on him. Our lab found traces of fish, rust resistant paint and salt in his clothes. The fish traces could be shrimp. Well, it's certainly positive he came in off a boat. Unless he walked through a fish market, bought four pounds of shrimp... and brushed against a freshly painted fire escape. I suppose those are all the photographs we have? Those the only ones sir. - The emergency shifts are coming in now sir. - Ok. Oh Captain... the boys are sort of wondering why they have to take these shots. They've been wondering, have they? Where do they think they are, in a summer camp? Because the Commissioner said so, that's why. It's what I told them, yes sir. What's the matter? They afraid of a little needle? They been wondering. Roll up your sleeve. What do you mean? What do you think you're going to do? - Roll up your sleeve. - Why should I take one of those things? Because the Commissioner said so and I told the Commissioner. Roll it up. - Anything funny Scott? - No sir, no sir. Oh brother, this I've got to see. What's the matter? You guys ain't got enough work to do? Yes sir. - Plenty of it Captain. - Well, get on it. Yeah, how about that? Well, you can't say you're not getting action. There's half the two bit criminals in town, more of them coming through. I wish you sounded more confident of getting information. Information? We'll get plenty of it about pickpockets, sneak thieves, wife beaters. But about your murderer? Not a chance. If it isn't going to work, what are you doing it? I'm doing it because the Commissioner told me to. And I'm doing it this way because it's the only way you let me. But why I'm doing it, I don't know. - How can I make you believe... - Believe it? Why shouldn't I believe you Doctor? You're a smart fellow, a college man. Probably wouldn't make something out of nothing just to be important. Mister, what we here for? I ought to be home. You know, my mother always told me if you look deep enough in anybody.. You could always find some good, but I don't know. With apologies to your mother that's the second mistake she made. I should've seen that one coming. - You drink coffee Captain? - Yeah. - Come on. I'll buy you a cup. - I'm busy. - I want to buy you a cup. - I'm busy. Come on. Let's see if you can drag that load across the street. Let's go. Look Captain, you have a family? You married? No, my wife died eight years ago. - I'm sorry. - The doc I got said she had neuralgia. She didn't, was a brain tumor. You don't think much of me as a doctor either, do you? You keep asking questions Doc, you finally get answers. No. You mind if I ask why? Government job in civil service. 30 years, a pension, what do you make? I think it runs about the same as a police captain. - Thanks lady. - See that? Probably phoned his lawyer to sue us for false arrest. Look Warren, the reason I asked if you have a family was that... Well, I thought if you had some children, you might realize the seriousness of this. - I haven't got any kids. - Well, thousands of people do. - And think what could happen to them. - I'll think anything you like, but... - I'll still say I'm doing everything I can. - Look, this man came off a boat. - He was obviously smuggled into the country. - We've checked every boat, we've... combed the waterfront and we're hauling in every man... that could possibly know anything about it. From what I've seen, they may not want to talk to the police. Maybe they don't, maybe they want to talk to their mothers. Maybe they want to talk to you, what can I do about it? Offer a reward, promise immunity for information. And get a couple more experts from Washington to help me out. - Well, you could use them. - You'll never see the day. Look, you mind if I do something on my own? Yes, I do. Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch? Listen Captain, I'm taking a chance you may be right. You can take a chance I know what I'm doing and let me do it. As a matter of fact, you'd help us both out you went home and went to bed. Ok, I'm not going to argue anymore. And I'm not going to wait until the facts penetrate that thick skull of yours. There just isn't that much time, there's for the coffee. - Hi you honey. - You look great. You got that stuff all packed Angie? My suits and them two sweaters? I got them, what are they after you for this time? Angie, why you want to talk like that? Why I told you it's just a trip, Blackie says... Blackie, Blackie, he runs you around like a dog on a leash. - He's my boss, ain't he? - He's a big goon. He pays me every week. Then he's a bigger boob than you been saying he was. Why don't you stand up to him sometime? - Why don't you tell him off? - Angie, will you shut up? What are you hanging around outside for? Why don't you get inside? And be alone with that big ape? You think I lost my buttons? Blackie? - Blackie? - Hurry up. Blackie? I wasn't long, was I? I packed everything like you told me. Can I bring your stuff down for you Blackie? - Who's that with you? - Just Angie. Is she coming? She's my wife. What am I going to do with her? First, tell her to get away from them machines. Angie, will you get away from there? Blackie don't like nobody fooling with them washing machines. Too late, they're falling apart now. Anything I don't like is a smart cracking dame. Hey, get away from there. Yes, you. What you want me to do, stand here? Will you tell her what she's supposed to do? Relax, will you Angie? We'll be leaving in a minute, eh Blackie? You should've stayed single. Well, you know how it is, she was working as... Where's Poldi? I told you to bring Poldi. I know you did Blackie. I went right over there, I told him what you said but he don't want to go. He don't want to go? Why don't he want to go? What's the matter with him? I don't know Blackie. He was getting dressed to go out. He said he was taking this dame out. He said he didn't want to go, I told him all about what was happening. Where he get the dough to go out? He never had a quarter, you ever know Poldi when he had a quarter? Oh, that's right, he's always... - borrowing from somebody. - So where he get the dough? Why is he all of a sudden taking a dame out? - You know, I got a hunch about him. - He could stay here Blackie. - Yeah, I got a hunch about him. - But look Blackie. Let's get going. I tell you, they're picking everybody up, ev... They ain't going to pick me up. You see them machines? That's business. Legitimate even, they ain't going to pick up a legitimate businessman. They're picking up legitimates, they picked me up, they're picking everybody up. That's just it, why? Why are they picking everybody up Fitch? Why? - I don't know Blackie, but let's get moving. - You don't know? You got a high-school education, you're a smart fellow. You don't know, figure it out. This guy Kochak is just a floater. He comes in off a boat, gets very unsocial. Even pulls a knife that he's going to use on Poldi. So they turn the town upside down for one crumb. They got every cop in town huffing and puffing trying to find out who he is. - Why are they doing that? - Blackie, I don't know. Then I'll figure it out for you. I got a hunch he brung something in, see? I got a hunch he brung something in and they're looking for it. Only, he ain't got it. And you know why? - Because his friend Poldi is got it. - Poldi? - You think he would do something like that? - He was his cousin, wasn't he? I told you I had a hunch about that guy and I was right. But Poldi is a nice guy. - He wouldn't do nothing. - He's trying put something over on me Fitch. I saved his life and that's how he repays me. You know Fitch, there's one thing I don't like. - You know what it is? - Sure Blackie, sure. Somebody trying to put something over on you. No, I never liked it. You find Poldi. I want to see him. No Blackie, no. Let's get out of town, I'm scared, I tell you. They'll pick me up again. Angie, will you stop with that? Just one thing but ain't going to do it again. Blackie, I don't know where Poldi went I don't know where to look for him. - I'm going to get out of town. - Look... Just told you I don't like nobody putting anything over on me. Particularly you, Fitch. Poldi ain't leaving town and you ain't leaving neither. - Ok Blackie, sure. - Hey, bump him, you big ape. Angie, stay away from him. I'll get him, I'll find him. - Thank you Fitch. - I swear I will. Come on Angie, let's go. But what am I going to do with them suitcases I packed? - Unpack them. - Come on Angie, hurry up. Fitch... I hope you're not planning on leaving town anyway. I wouldn't do that, where would you go? Yeah, that's right, where would I go? - Is this the seaman's Hiring Hall? - Yeah, this is it. - They're trolling the ships now. - Thanks a lot. On the Joseph Martin Fitzgerald Steamship Company, a Liberty Ship... going to Rio, sailing at 7 in the morning, 2 ABs. We have 11:25 and 11:27. They're going, they're going, they're gone. - Do this guy a favor. - Thank you. On the steamship Pelican, Louisiana Steamship Company... a C2 going to Yokohama, sailing at noon, 2 oilers. Say, fellow, you mind if I make an announcement? - Just take a second. - I have 11:28 and 11:29. They're going, they're going, they're gone. Grab the mike a minute Leo? Swell, thank you very much. Could I have your attention, please? Could I have your attention? This is very important. I have some pictures of a man here. I'll pass them out right away. You take care of those please? You mind sir? Thank you. Now, please take a good look at him. I'll pay 50 dollars to anyone who can tell me anything at all about him, anything. I'm not from the police, so you can't get into any trouble. I just want the information, and I'm willing to pay for it. Thank you very much. Thanks an awful lot. - Thank you sir. Ok, buddy. - Bye. Ok, anybody that's ever seen this man speak right up, will you? - I never saw him before. - I never saw him either. Anybody that can tell me anything at all? How about it? - I've never seen him before. - I've never seen him Mac. I've never seen him. - You got the dough on you Johnny? - Can you tell me anything? I can tell you you're taking a terrific chance... flashing that kind of dough around this mob, shipping is tough. You can say that again. I'm serious about this, any information at all. Even if you just think you've ever seen him. - What's this fellow done lad? - Nothing, there's no trouble. Let me give you a bit of advice. These fellows are not liable to talk around here. - What do you mean? - He's liable to be a seaman too. - That's right bud. - Yeah, I got you. - Thanks. - No trouble at all. Look, if anybody knows anything about him, I'll be at Frank's Place right next door here until 7 o'clock. You can ask any questions you want to. You can give me the information if you want to do that, Ok? You buy the coffee mate? I'll buy your breakfast, your lunch and your dinner if... you can find me anybody who knows this man. We have three Liberties coming out of the boneyard, we'll need three full crews. On the right pier, Steamship company, sailing Friday, one boatswain and two ordinaries. On the boatswain we have 11:25, it's going. Throw that sugar down, will you? Come on with those eggs Frank, I got to make the 7 o'clock bus, you hear? I'm coming, I'm coming. That's the one, that's the one. - Can I speak to you? - Sure, go right ahead. - Are you the man who's looking for someone? - Yeah, as a matter of fact I was. Someone looking for $50? That's right. Well, he said for you to come with me, will you? He said? Who's he? - Are you coming? - Yeah. - It's cold down here by the water. - Yeah. Now, what was it you wanted to know? I want to know if your friend has ever seen this man. Why? But obviously, I want to find out about him. - Did something wrong? - No, he did nothing wrong. Nobody is going to get into any trouble, have you ever seen him? - No, no, I've never seen him. - Come on, come on. Then where is this friend of yours? Oh, he wanted to know why you were looking. He did, eh? Well, if he wants to know so badly, let him come and ask me and... What are you doing here? Where you come from? - Cut it out. - Who are you, a cop? I'm with the Public Health Service, I'm a doctor. - A doctor? - That's right, I'm a doctor. I want to know who this man is... how he got into the country, what ship he was smuggled off. A lot of wanting for 50 bucks. That's all you're going to get, take it or leave it. - Charlie, I told you not to drink anymore. - I told you yesterday to keep away from me. - Did you bring this man into the country? - No. Because if you did, there's a good chance you're going to die in about four days. - Who are you trying to kid? - Nobody, I'm trying to save you. - You're a sailor, you ever hear of plague? - The plague? This man died of it yesterday morning. - He's making it up. - I'm not making it up. - No, I don't think he... - Trying to frame me. I ain't never seen this guy. I ain't been out of port in 10 days and I can prove it. If you didn't bring him in or have any contact with him... then you got nothing to worry about. - No, wait. - Let him go. - No, I won't. - Get out of here. You told me yourself Charlie, that the man was sick when you brought him here. Why, you stupid little fool. - Take it easy. - Charlie please, he's a doctor. - He ought to know what he's doing. - This is $50, this is anti-plague serum. Charlie? Now, roll up your sleeve and start talking. Hold this, will you? I got him off a tramp out in the Gulf. I don't know his name, and I know nothing about him. I swung the whole deal with one of the mates. What ship? - I don't know. - You know. - It was night, I couldn't see. - What ship? - Give him the shot Doc, please. - What's the name of that ship? I said I don't know. Look, sailor, this is the only hypodermic I got and it breaks very easily. Now, start talking or you're going to get into trouble. - Charlie. - All right. - Was the Nile Queen. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Alright, hold still. Roll up your sleeve. Now hold still. Bring them aboard, I'm going to finish my breakfast. Aye, aye sir. Couldn't he have been aboard without your knowledge Captain? No, he couldn't, this is a waste of your time and mine. The sooner you go over the side, the sooner I can get underway again. Pass the word to the engine room to stand by to get underway. Have any luck? Nothing. Did he tell you anything? - Told me nothing. - Let's go. You cost me two hours delay already with this heaving to. Look Captain, the man I spoke to was positive the ship was the Nile Queen. For the last time I'm telling you I never saw the man in my life. Anyone who says he was smuggled in off my ship is a liar. A man exposed to pneumonic plague doesn't lie. - I say he did. - All right Captain. - Is he going to call me a liar too? - I'm calling you a fool. Ok, I'll get off your ship, but if that man was aboard you... and most of your crew will be dead before you're halfway to Santiago. - I'll worry about that. - Take it easy, take it easy. We're in international waters. This man is master of this vessel, we've no authority here. Come on, let's go. What you find out? Well, from tracings on those beams Clint, I can guarantee 150 to 170 rats on this ship. What did I tell you? You men hear that? Rats and they might be carrying plague. Hey, what's going on down there? Boatswain, get those men out of there, all of them, get back to work. Alright boys, let's start moving. - No, we want to hear what he's saying. - Yeah, we want to hear. Never mind what he's saying, get moving. Don't shove me. Mr. Anson, break out the weapons, ready and stand by. Stop bluffing Captain, you got plague on this ship. You're inciting my men to mutiny. Now, get off of here before I... - take action against you. - Your men know it's true. Wasn't there another man on board who died just last week? I'm the master here and for the last time I'm telling you... Doc... One of your cooks is down with fever, that's just the first one Captain. Now what are you going to do about it? What do you want me to do? Right now, I want to inoculate every man on board. After that, you'll put about and quarantine your ship under my men. What about the stowaways? I didn't have anything to do with them. Wouldn't make much difference if you were dead. - Get the equipment Paul. - All right. All right, let's get started. - Sail maker. - Sail maker, yes. You're sure these two men got on at Oran? They must be, the only place they could. What about the other man? Did anybody see his body after he died? Well, he's the sail maker. He sewed him up, he might have. - No, I just dumped him over the side. - Great. - Secondary infection from the man who died. - Sure, it's the only possible way. Ok, you can move along. Think we have enough on this fellow? - Yes sir. - Ok, that will be all for you. Now, you come on and sit down here. Did you ever see these two men who were in the chain locker? - He see them every day. - You see them every day? How come? - He cabin boy, he bring them food. - Ok, let him talk for himself now. - You brought them their food every day? - Yes sir. - Did they ever say anything? - Sure, food stinks. Goodbye. - Thls boy just kills you, doesn't he? - Now, did they... - Are you the cook? - Yes sir. Go away. Did they ever talk about anything else? No sir, only one time they tell me to tell cook to make shish kebab. Shish kebab, they want shish kebab. - Shut up. - I like shish kebab. Yes I'm sure and if I knew what shish kebab was, maybe we'd be on the trail of something. It's lamb on a skewer, some of the Greek and Armenian restaurants around town serve it. To tell you the truth, I'm rather fond of it myself. That's it, they call me dirty names. They say when they go ashore... - They go ashore? - They know a place. What's the name of the place? Did they say the name of the place? He doesn't know, just a restaurant. Ok, run along. Well, I thought maybe we had something there, it might be a little something at that. And now you ask me the questions? I suppose we're apt to wind up at a policeman's benefit, but I'll have to. Where's the owner of this joint? Over here. What is it? - You the proprietor? - Yes. - John Mefaris? - Yes sir. - You serve Greek food? - Anything you like gentlemen. We're from the Public Health Service. I run clean place, I passed inspection last month. No, we're just trying to identify a man, that's all. You know this man? Has he ever come in your place? What you want him for? You don't mind my asking you? - I'm asking you, do you recognize him? - He's not across the street. You won't get into any trouble. We just want some information. - I ain't worried. - He had an infection, a contagious disease. We want to find out who he was, where he went, the people he saw. Sure, sure. I don't know. So many people come here all the time. Maybe my wife, I'll ask her. Yeah. I got a feeling this is going to be very helpful. You know this is hopeless, don't you Doc? This is about the 15th joint we've been in. It's 11 by actual count. What can you suggest? Look, we run the whole story in tonight's paper, his picture, everything. Mean, I'll block every road leaving town, cover the bus stations and... - No, eh? - You're getting it, slowly. They sure make them stubborn up where you come from. That's right. It's the man that fellow Poldi, brought in the other night. Yes. Kochak. The one that ate like a field hand. - What about him? - They asked me if I know him. For pity sakes, go and tell them and stop fussing at me. It's the Board of Health, they say he's sick. Oh, that Board of Health was here last month. We've paid for our license, though I don't know how we did it. - But they say he's sick, bad sick. - So am I sick. But this is contagious. Contagious? Then you tell them to go and mind their own business. We don't know nothing about it. - Don't stand there, go and tell them. - But the law, we got to obey the law. - We've never seen him. - I don't know, I don't like it. Oh John, I got a headache that's fit to kill me. If you don't go out there and tell them that we don't know nothing about this... get them out of this place, I'm going to do it myself. Stop all this nonsense, go on and tell them. Ok Rita, Ok. I'll tell them, I'll tell them. She doesn't know anything either. Why don't you leave the picture? - He may come sometime. - I don't think he'll be around for a while. They're there now Blackie, in the back. - They found Poldi, eh? - Yes, I tipped him off where to go. Did you take care of that other matter Pat? - I stayed all night, watched the house. - What happened? - She came home early, not a peep out of her. - Good. - Here you are Pat. - No, no thanks. No, Blackie, no. God bless you Blackie. God bless you. Hey, you get away from there. This is my beat, get away. Paper sir? Blackie, I found him, see? I found him. Pat told me how you found him. What's that smell in here? Have you been trying something on your hair again? No Blackie, I ain't put nothing on it. - Touched that yet? - No Blackie. Hi you Blackie. - Hello Poldi, what's the matter? - I'm sick, don't feel so good. You felt good enough to stay out last night and run me all over town. You gave him a little bit of trouble, eh Poldi? - Who's this? - My kid brother Vincent. Let's lose him. I told you, I don't feel good. I need somebody with me. We're with you Poldi, blow out of here, kid. Who asked you curly? - Hit the road before I... - Don't be objectionable Fitch. - Nice to know you Vince. - Thanks Blackie. - You want to do Blackie a favor kid? - Yeah, I guess so. Run out and get me a scratch sheet. Maybe I got something I can put a couple of bucks on for you. Thanks Blackie. Thanks Blackie. Don't feel good, eh Poldi? I got a pretty good doctor. Maybe he can take a look at you. I'll be all right, I've just got a cold in my head, I ought to be in bed. - Ah? - Ah, what? - Ah, you're always bellyaching, that's what. - Nobody asked you. Leave him alone Fitch, maybe he's got a touch of swamp fever or something. Look Poldi, I wouldn't have had him bother you, I only wanted to ask... About Kochak? I never should've brung him that night, I'm sorry Blackie. - But you got your dough and everything... - I wasn't thinking about him Poldi. - But now that you bring it up, tell me... - He was nothing, honest. He was nothing, just enough to have every cop in town looking for him. They're grabbing every guy in sight, whether he's got a record or not. Yeah. They even picked up the master criminal here. Why you suppose they're doing that Poldi? I don't know Blackie. Like I told Fitch, he was a cousin of mine. But I don't know nothing else about him. Some cousin. He might've killed you if I hadn't been there. - Yeah, a fine cousin. - I thank you Blackie, but... he didn't bring nothing into the country. I mean, he wouldn't. What made you say that Poldi? I don't know Blackie, I just thought that... maybe the cops or maybe you thought that... I got to get out of here and get some water. Sit down Poldi, here's some water. What made you say that? I don't know Blackie, I just thought that you figured that... Why would I figure that? I don't know. But there was nothing. Nothing at all, can't you believe me? Why should he? Don't talk like that Fitch, all Poldi said was he didn't bring nothing in. Poldi ought to know, the guy was his cousin. He was going to stay with you, wasn't he Poldi? He left his stuff with you. I don't know where he was going to stay, I... Sit down Poldi, I'm talking to you, it ain't polite to get up when... I thought there was something funny about that shirt. La Pere, Lisbon. - When was you in Lisbon last? - You lied to Blackie, Poldi. He don't like to be lied to, you know what I mean Poldi? He don't like it. He just had a couple of shirts... - you can have them all Blackie. - What's that smell? - What you got on you? - Nothing, I ain't got nothing on. You're lying again. Perfume. Dough to go out last night, I'm disappointed in you. I treated you like a friend and look at you. I ain't lying. Honest, I ain't. See why I'm always right Fitch? Because I never trust nobody. You make an exception and... You remember how it was when we took Poldi in? - Share and share alike? - Yeah, that's right Blackie. What's yours is mine. Only friend Poldi doesn't believe that. He's like everybody else, just out for himself. No, no, no. - That isn't true. I wouldn't do nothing... - What am I going to do with you Poldi? What would you do if you was in my shoes and a friend double-crossed you? How would you... Hi Poldi. Hi, handsome. Blackie, can I see you for just a minute? - Sure baby, anything wrong? - No, nothing. What's the matter with you? Why don't you tell him? I don't know nothing, I tell you. Blackie honey, I just got to have a 100 dollars. Sure honey, if you really... I'll be with you in a minute kid. Thought that dame gave him the brush. Out in the street. You see Fitch? Didn't I tell you he's been holding out on us? - Blackie, I didn't mean to let him get away. - That's all right Fitch, don't get sweaty. Where's he going to go that we can't find him? Come on. Car 17, car 17, car... He was tied up right off the end of the dock here this morning. Car 12. Captain Warren Captain Warren. Emergency. Woman sick. 124 Governor Nichols. High fever case. Captain Warren. Captain Warren. Please acknowledge. The woman called him Charlie, doesn't that mean anything? Not to me mister. Now I got a nephew named Charlie, but... I'm sure he's a nice fellow. That's great. I don't know, that was my last idea. - Captain Warren. - What? - There's a call. - What is it? It's a woman. Sick. Fever case, it's an emergency call. What's going on here? Not now, lady. The boys in the patrol car are picking up the husband Captain. Have him here in a few minutes. Wish that doctor called sooner. I'll have to quarantine the whole apartment. Gafney will inoculate. Call in and tell Monahan I want a detail here right away. Cover the entrance yourself. Nobody in or out but the husband. Yes sir. - No chance of a mistake? - No, you couldn't miss it. Oh Paul, I want all that bedding burned after you get her out. - That door. - Yes sir. What about the death certificate? It's got to be filed. The doctor put down a tentative diagnosis of pneumonia with complications. - That'll do for now. - And how about the body? I'll have the Board of Health take care of it. What happened? What you do here? - Alright, clear these people out of here. - Where's my wife? Rita? Where is she? What you do? - Let me see my wife. - I can't let you go in there. - What you do to her? - Your wife is dead. Dead? Dead. Rita? She can't be, you lie. She's dead mister. This afternoon Doc, she said she just don't feel good. - I'm sorry. - She... You remember me Mefaris? We showed you a picture of a man and asked if you knew him. - You lied to us, who was he? - I don't know, I don't know. If you'd told us the truth, there's a chance your wife might not have died. - Who is he? - Don't know, don't know. Look Mefaris, I want to know about this man. He had the disease that killed your wife, now who is he? - His disease killed my wife? - Yes. - Now, who is he? Who is he? Who is he? - Kochak. His name was Kochak, I don't know him. - Poldi brought him the other night. - Ok, who is Poldi? - Rita served him. - Who's Poldi? Where does he live? - Where does he live? - Gloria Hotel, I guess. Come on, there's nothing you can do for him, let's go. - The ambulance is outside now. - Gloria Hotel, I guess. - Yes sir? - Have them work with Gafney. This place is quarantined. Get the address of Mefaris' restaurant, quarantine that. Then try and get a list of everybody who's been in there in the past three days. Yes sir. - Wonder how many people have been in there. - It's getting pretty rugged. Look, you stay here and take charge, will you Ben? - Send for any help you need. - Right. - Nobody in or out, nobody. - Right. Come on. Gloria Hotel, let's go. Gloria Hotel, eh? Right. Thanks. Nobody in or out, nobody. Come on. - What do you want? - I'm looking for a fellow named Poldi. - He's not up in his room. - Where is his room? All right, follow me. Never mind why I want him, I want him. I swear to you Captain, if I know the guy has a record, I never take him in. I run a clean establishment. Yeah, I know. Nothing but retired millionaires and honeymooners. No Cap, you know I wouldn't have nobody... Look, we pulled three hoodlums out of here last month. Now who knew this man? Nobody Cap. Honest, nobody. - The guy just comes in for a room and I... - Well, just a minute. - Just a minute, I just do remember. - He just does remember. - Couple of guys were looking for him today. - Who were they? No, I don't know, honest. I don't know. You got to believe me. Why? Come on. Let's get out of here. You're going to get both of us in trouble, so why don't you be a nice fellow? Why don't you take your big hands off me and knock off? - I'm warning you Neff, you hear me? - I hear you, that's the trouble. - I can't seem to tune you out. - All right, that's enough. Oh Neff, I didn't know you lived here too. I'm ready for your statement on this story now Doctor. - What story is that Neff? - Oh, cut it out. You think I've been walking around with my head in a bag? You and the Public Health Service turning this town upside down? A murdered hoodlum, a ship in quarantine and now, a woman dead. - An idiot could figure it out. - You qualify, what do you figure? I figure the guy had smallpox or cholera or something like that. And I want to know why this story wasn't released to the press. - Listen you... - Wait a minute Warren. Now look Neff, it isn't smallpox and it isn't cholera. It's plague, pneumonic plague. - Plague? - That's why we can't let you have the story. - You can't let me have it. - That's right. With a chance of an epidemic? I knew you guys were crazy, but... - Wait a minute Neff, wait a minute. - Wait for what? Somebody else to die? Not much. - You've already wasted a day and a half. - I'm sorry. - But I can't let you print this story. - You can't let me print it. - Since when have you been making the rules? - I represent the Public Health Service. Well, I represent the public and they got a right to know what's going on, and no two bit civil servant... Regardless of your opinion, I got to do what I think is best. Did you do what you thought was best for that woman who just died? If the doctor had known what was going on, couldn't he have saved her? Couldn't he? - I don't know. - You don't know. And because you don't know, you don't want anybody else to know. - Well, there's a chance we could contain... - You bet there is. And don't think for a minute that everybody in this town isn't going to get it. Oh, drop it. If your editor's got the story, let him go ahead and print it. Well, my editor doesn't have it, but he's going to get it. Oh, he doesn't have it, eh? What do you know? - Take him. - A pleasure. Oh, wait a minute, - what do you think you're trying to pull? - He speaks to no one. What's the charge, Warren? Loitering, public nuisance, anything you like. You're crazy, I'll have your badge for this Warren. You know I can do it. Take him out. - You'll be walking a beat if you're lucky. - Now. If I'd been busted by every newspaperman that tried to get my bars... I'd be mopping floors in the Hall of Justice years ago, come on. Can that reporter really make trouble for him? Trouble? Where you've been living mister? If that newspaper wanted to put the pressure on him... he'd be lucky if he could get a job mopping floors, let's go Bill. Clint? I thought I heard you. Don't come any closer, honey. You better stay right there. - Anther contagion case, eh? - Yeah. And another uniform to be decontaminated. Some fun, eh? You didn't catch it yourself, did you? You look a little beat. Yeah, I look so good normally. - I didn't pay it. - You can pay it tomorrow. No, I can't pay it tomorrow, and I can't pay it the next day. I spent the money. Now, will you please just forget about that bill? When I get the dough, I'll pay it. Just stop pestering me about it. - Clint honey, I didn't say anything. - Yeah, I know. Whenever you're tired, you always seem to think I'm scolding you. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - And I wasn't. - I know. I know, you're right. - What happened? I gave it to somebody. Clint, I wasn't, I wasn't talking about the money. Well, anyway, I spent it on something for the department. You can put in a voucher or whatever they call them. As far as I know, nobody is yet figured out a way to get... money back from the US government, quickly, that is. - I'll make up the cot for you. - No, I got to go right out again honey. Go right out? Look, be a good kid and make me some coffee, will you? - How about some nice, hot soup? - Just coffee Nancy. - But Clint, you need... - Coffee. Nancy, I told you, I can't sleep. I got to take a shower and get out of here. - Sleep last night? - Last night? Yeah. Sure, guess I must've. Oh, I didn't call you, did I? - It's all right. - I didn't think. It's a plague case, pneumonic. - Plague? Here in New Orleans? - Yeah, a woman died of it tonight. Whoever it's carrying it still wandering around. Well, at least they have you. You've been through it. You know how to handle it. Now look hon, let's not be little Miss Sunshine. All right, all right. We went through it, why don't you lie down? - Just for an hour or two? - Gafney is waiting for me at the office. He hasn't had any sleep either. Gafney can wait, he's younger than you are. Baby, Methuselah is younger than I am tonight. - What's eating you anyway? - Nothing. - Come on. - I'm all right, just out of gas. I'm tired and I'm fed up. Well, if you won't lie down, at least sit, you're making me tired standing. - Stick around honey. - I got to get the coffee. I'm just afraid if I sit down, the next thing, I'll lie down. If I lie down, sure as there are worms in little green apples, I'll fall asleep. If I fall asleep, I'm dead. Now you're cooking. - Just don't let me fall asleep, will you? - I'll watch you. You know, today I took a perfectly nice guy, a cop... not the smartest guy in the world, but who is? So I push him around, make a lot of smart... cracks about him and tell him off all day long. And he winds up proving he's four times the man I'll ever be. - I don't believe it. - Why do I do that? You're tired now. All right, so I'm tired. But you know what I mean. Yeah, I guess I do. - Yeah, I do the same thing to you, don't I? - Yes, you do. Well? Well Clint, you're not a kid anymore and you ought to stop thinking like one. What do you mean? Well, like those jobs you're always talking about, Arabian pipelines... or expeditions to Chile as medical adviser or, you know. Yeah, what you want to say is that I'm a bust now and to forget about them. - That's what you mean, isn't it? - That's exactly what I don't mean. You might get an offer like that tomorrow and you'd be perfect for it. But that's a chance and it's in the future, you can't spend the rest of your life... You know, you're a pretty lucky guy right this minute. Lucky? - Holy smoke. - You are. You've done exactly what you planned you were... going to do when you were a junior in medical school. - How many people can say that? - I don't know. But I do know I've got exactly 38 dollars in the savings account. So, every once in a while you... you get a guilty feeling that you've been missing out... or that you owe something to... to me, or to Tommy, or somebody or other. Then you take it out on whoever happens to be around. Mostly, I'm around. So? So stop feeling sorry for yourself. - Yes, ma'am. - And don't get smart with me. If there's a plague here, you're the most important guy in town. - And not only to me. - Yes, ma'am. - So? - So that's all. Well, how long you've been cooking that one up? You'd be surprised, housework leaves a lot of time for thinking. Some of it I thought up a few weeks ago. About the time I decided... Tommy wasn't going to be an only child anymore. - You decided what? - You heard me. Oh, for Pete's sake. Do you mind? You son of a gun. You said yourself that it was bad for Tommy to be an only child. Well, what do you know? - And Clint, aside from Tommy... - No, you got to stay away from me honey. Aside from Tommy, I... I've no intention of being too old to enjoy my grandchildren. How do you like that? Don't worry about the money Clint, we'll work it out. I'm not worried. This is nice. I guess the reason I did it was because I knew you really wanted it. I like you, Clint. It's only fair that you get some of the things you want. I guess that's the real reason. Clint? Hey. What's up? - I don't know but it ain't good. - Well, what's going on? I said I don't know, they just told me to get you and bring you over here. Sorry I had to call you here, but my office and my home are crawling with reporters. Now, I find you've arrested one. What's the matter with you Warren? You lost your mind? If desk sergeant hadn't made a mistake, he'd be there still. Yeah, I know. - What imbecility prompted... - He did it on my authority Mr. Mayor. - Your authority? - Yes sir. What authority is that? You're an adviser here Doctor, a guest. And you can oblige me by confining your authority to your own duties. Where's Mackey? We can't fool around with this any longer. I told him to get over here right away, he should be here any minute now. All I want is a simple statement of fact, that shouldn't take him too long. Mr. Mayor, we already got a line on one of the dead man's friends. - His name is Poldi. - Have you made any arrests yet? - No sir. - When will you? - Well, it's hard to go out... - I'm sorry, we can't wait that long for you. - I'm sorry about the delay. - Yeah. - Have you got it with you? - Yes sir. - Best I could do on such short notice. - How are you Doctor? - About the same. - That's all I wanted. I had Mackey make up a statement... a complete explanation of the facts as they stand. Before I give it to Neff here, I want a confirmation from you that... the disease can be contained and there's no reason for panic. Our only chance for full cooperation Clint, is to inform the public. You agree? No, the minute he prints it, the men we're looking for will leave the city. Now, I told you once and I'll tell you again... anyone leaving here with plague endangers the entire country. The entire country hasn't got it, we have. A woman died here last night. This problem lies right here in our own community. Community? What community? Do you think you're living in the Middle Ages? - Come now. - Anybody that leaves... here can be in any city in the country within 10 hours. I could leave here today and I could be in Africa tomorrow. And whatever disease I had would go right with me. I know that. Then think of it when you're talking about communities. We're all in a community, the same one. Give me a cigarette. Take the pack. - Can I go now? - All right. There are about four more hours before the morning edition. Then I'm wasting my time here. - Do what you can Tom. - I couldn't hold Neff. Strangely enough, I find myself in complete agreement with you... but I couldn't hold him. - He can color a story any way he wants. - Yes, he can. But that's his privilege, I won't take it away from him. And I won't say it isn't better that way. - What is it, Bob? - Mind if I take off now sir? All right, but I want to be on the radio in the morning at 9 o'clock. I'll be here by then sir. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm taking the kids upriver to their grandmother's. I'll be in your office by 8:30, but I got to do it. All right. - Well, here we go. - Don't get any wrong ideas. He'll be there in the morning and he'll stay there. Yeah, sure he will and kids are kids. Nevertheless, here we go. - You want some coffee? - No, I don't think so. To tell you the truth, I'm scared to death. I want to call Washington and start getting some help in here. Well Dan, I seem to remember you as the guy that talked me into running for this office. I was hoping you'd forget that. - Goodbye Father. - Goodbye Father. If you need me Mama, send Vince, I'll be right over. Thank you, Father. This is Poldi's mother. This is Blackie, his best friend, he wants to help him. Yes, I heard he was sick, but I can't find him Mama. He's not in his room, I was worried about him. No, no, he's home. Always when he's sick, he comes home. - But he's dying this time. - No, and Mama, he's not going to die. I'm not going to let him. I'm going to send for a doctor for him. But the neighbors already they have sent for somebody. Yes, but Mama, this is my doctor, he's the best. He'll make Poldi well, you'll see. Now, you tell Vince to go and get him, eh? You see that Vince gets the doc. - Say, where did Fitch say was going? - He went to breakfast. He didn't go to breakfast, I've been looking for him. Now, find him and bring him over, you hurry up. God bless you Blackie, god bless you. That's great Poldi. Drink it up, it'll do you good. I'm going to talk eerie of you. It's just you and me, eh Poldi? Just you and me, we're going... Hi you Blackie, I was just going to get you. I was going to get you, only Poldi was so sick... - I didn't want to leave him. - Shouldn't have done it. Shouldn't have done it. He says we shouldn't have done it, he says... What will we do Blackie? Shouldn't have done it. - We shouldn't have... - Take it easy. We shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry Poldi, but there's nothing we can do about that anymore. First thing we got to do is get you well. You hear me Poldi? We got to get you well. I sent Vince for a doctor. Vince is going to bring him here. He's going to get you well. - Ain't going to get well. - Sure you're going to get well. - I'm going to die. - No, you ain't going to die. I want to confess please. - You'll confess later. - Get me a priest. You don't need a priest, you need a doctor. I'm getting you one. You're going to get well. Will you stop Poldi? Stop aggravating him, will you Poldi? What's this? I don't know Blackie, I didn't see it when I come in. - Let's get out of here. - Let him confess everything to the priest? - I'm going to get out of here. - You're not going anyplace. Not till Poldi tells us. - Blackie, you ain't going to... - I ain't going to what? All right Poldi, let's get this straight now, just between us. - What did Kochak bring in? - Take it easy. Don't know, I don't know. It's just may Kochak, I don't know. You know, you talked to him in that lingo Poldi. - I don't know nothing. - Where is it Poldi? It must be lying around someplace, it must be worth a fortune... the way they're looking for who killed him. I got the connections Poldi, I can move that stuff. - We'll split it, me and you. - I want a priest please. - What did you do with it Poldi? - Please, I want a priest. - Kochak, three aces... - He's getting delirious. - He ain't delirious. - He's hysterical. He ain't hysterical. Where's the stuff Poldi? Where's the stuff? Your brother Vince, Poldi, is a nice kid. You don't want him to grow up here. If you had some dough, you could buy him and your old lady a place in the country. Country is good for kids, makes them healthy. Be good for you too Poldi, you got to get well. You're sick Poldi, very, very sick and you ain't going to get well in this dump. I got a doc coming, he's a specialist, but he's going to cost dough... a lot of dough. Now, where's the stuff Poldi? What did you do with it? - What did Kochak bring? - Alright, alright, alright. - We're going to be friends Poldi. - What's going on here? How did you people get in this room? - Get off that bed. - Who sent for you? - Let's get out of here. - What are you doing here anyway? Are you members of the family? We're his best friends. - Well, clear out of here. - Don't do that. This man is got to be taken to a hospital immediately. He ain't going to no hospital. It just happens I've already reported the case. An ambulance is on its way over. Well, you can just send it back, because he ain't going to no hospital. His family have already agreed to hospitalization. I brung the doc. - Good morning all. - How is he Miss? He's a very sick man. High fever Doctor. - Hot, very hot. - Fine. Rapid pulse, respiration difficult and uneven. I phoned the hospital for an ambulance, they're on their way. He's going to stay here, that's why we got the doc. Now tell her doc. But if the nurse says, we... Vince, you don't want Poldi lying around some... charity ward, do you? With some intern working on him? I had an aunt once went to the hospital, she never come out. No, No, that's all right son. We'll take care of him. Probably just a touch of malarial fever. We'll have him on his feet in... But Doctor, his respiration, he can barely breathe. Oh, it's probably some pulmonary complications. Now, there's no need to excite the family members. Yes sir. I'm sorry. But don't you think a hospital... - You know these people, very superstitious. - Well yes, but... And if you take the patient without permission... All right Doctor. We can't force treatment on you... but if you take my advice young man, you'll get your brother... - Doc? - That will be all, thank you Nurse. Just escort the young lady downstairs, will you son? Shouldn't have done it, shouldn't have done it. This man's in very bad shape. Just fix him up so he can talk, give him a shot of something. Will take more than a shot to make him talk. - Whatever takes, give it to him. - He needs an oxygen tent. - He'd be better off going to a hospital. - He's going to no hospital. Better fix him up now Doc. - I tell you he needs an oxygen tent. - Send out for some. Unfortunately, I am persona non grata in most of the medical supply houses. What? Now look, it's important for Poldi to talk to us Doc. Very important, you understand me? Well, there's a little private place that I have access to. - It's rather an expensive proposition. - Never mind that, we'll take care of that. How do we get him out of here? Well, if you can lift that mattress and get him down to my car... we'll take care of him right now. All right, let's go. It's on the third floor, Doctor, up those stairs. - Right. - Thanks for reporting it. I think you'd better wait down here. - All right, hold it. - Out of the way bub. We got a sick man here. - I'm a doctor, I want to take a look at him. - We got our own doctor. - Get out of the way. - Isn't his name Poldi? - Put him down, I want to see. - Get out of the way. I think his neck's broken. Hey, Officer. They've stolen my truck. - They've stolen my truck. - Ok, alright, alright. - Hey, Officer... - They just killed Poldi. - What? - Danny, Gafney. Quarantine the whole place. Captain Warren to headquarters. Signal 50, coffee warehouse. Captain Warren to headquarters, Signal 50, coffee warehouse. Come on Reed. Look, you two guys go over that way. Cover the roof of the building. You go out and raise hell for help. Hold it there. Come on. Stay right down here and post yourself, block the inside. Come on. - Kicked in the skylight and got through. - Put a line up around here right away. - Right away. - Now get going. Hi Tom, got the emergency squads working and the riot trucks are coming in. Hi you Blackie. Well, well. Look what drifted back. - Hi you Pete. - Hey, you've been hiding fella? - Ain't seen you in a dog's age. - No, I've been around. Yeah, a lot of the boys being asking for you. - You figuring on coming back to work here? - No, not me. Had enough of this stuff. - Say, when is that fruit boat sailing? - The Honduras? Late this afternoon, she's unloaded already. Say, you ain't figuring on signing on, are you? She's got a full crew. Well, I'll try her anyway, take it easy Pete. Yeah Blackie, be good. If you can't be good, be careful. Get them, hold those guys Pete. - They mean you Blackie. - Get them, get them. - Hold them Pete. - Don't start no trouble now Blackie. I... We start at opposite ends of the building and work... Captain, they just shot a watchman in the warehouse. That's it, let's go. - Start issuing rifles, sub-machine guns. - We can't have those men shot Captain. They're no good to us dead. No shooting? What are we supposed to do, play tag? Who is this guy anyway? - Come on Danny, let me give you a rundown. - I don't need no rundown. These are armed hoodlums, I've got one man dead and two wounded... - already. - I know. Blackie, I can't go any further, we can't get out of here. - We got to quit. - You ain't quitting Fitch I'm getting on that fruit boat. Ok, if that's the way it is, starve them out or use gas but I ain't taking... - responsibility. - Gas? With a half a million dollars' worth of coffee? Are you? Where's Reed? Reed? You two men, listen to me. I've got something to tell you. Keep going, down by that manhole, keep going. Poldi had plague. - I can't, I can't... - Shut up. Do you hear me? Poldi had plague. Listen, Poldi had plague. I'm a doctor. I can cure you, it's your only chance. Blackie, he had plague, look how he looked. You touched him. I touched him too, maybe he's right. - Maybe we got the plague. - Shut up. I'm a doctor and I can cure you, it's your only chance. Come out now and surrender and I promise nothing will happen to you. It's got to be here, get these sacks off. Reed. Where's the other man? All right, come on and get out of there. Come on, move it. Get off. Get off. I give up, I give up. I'll tell you anything. Alright, it's just a flesh wound. Al, Bushway, get him out of here. Come on. - Where's the other one? - Went around those straits. Come on fat boy, on your feet. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, let's go. Captain Captain. - Captain, there he is. - Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. He ain't going no place. - Alright Leo. - Alright. Now we got to fish him out. Hey, almost forgot to tell you, they found that... case of perfume under the sink in Poldi's tenement. - No Customs stamps. - Perfume? - Yeah. - Worth anything? Oh, about 200 or 300 bucks. - Why, do you want a bottle? - No, thanks. Not for me. Car 17, car 17.37 and 23rd and Katina. Dog barking. Well, back to the grind again, eh? A barking dog, they got a lot to worry about sending a squad... - car out... - What are you getting so tough about? I don't know. - So long Clint, keep me in mind, will you? - Right Captain, so long. - Hello there Doctor. - Oh, hello there Redfield, how are you? - All right. - Good. Say, Tommy tells me you haven't been around in a couple of days. You ought to spend some time with that boy, he's a great kid. - Yeah, being kind of busy. - Your own son comes first, you know. I'll get to work on it. Say, by the way, ought not leave this out either. - Wood rots. - Thanks. In a wild chase during which one man was killed and the other captured. As a result, Dr. Mackey of the Board of Health has been able to issue a bulletin... that all contacts have been found and inoculated. Sounds like Mackey is got things under control. He's a good man, turn it off. - Hi honey. - Hi, anything new around here? Not a thing. - What's that? - A bill from the cleaners, uniforms. Thought I forgot, didn't you? What a mushy dame.
