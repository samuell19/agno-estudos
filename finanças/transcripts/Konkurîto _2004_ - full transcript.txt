"Youth is blessed only in that it holds the promise of a future." - Nikolai Gogol. Crimes committed by juvenile offenders have grown ever more heinous, with many sending shockwaves throughout society. This is the story of some young people who lost touch with reality, and acted according to their basest desires. I wonder why it turned out this way. What kind of a person am I? Sensei, you wanted to see me? Osugi, you came. Bring him over here. Get over here! You think you're hot shit because you won a Tokyo tournament, don't you? We've had about enough of you! We're taking you out! I was the best at that tournament! You want a piece of me? I guess just one opponent isn't enough of a challenge. Cut the shit, you assholes. We're gonna make sure you never walk again. Osugi! We'll take you to a better 'dojo'. Did he just call me an asshole? My hearing isn't so good these days. Maybe it's just my imagination. I'll have to go talk to your teacher again, I can't take this anymore! - It's humiliating; don't go. - You've been beaten to a pulp... It's gone beyond embarrassment. If you do go and talk to the teacher, what do you think the judo club members will do next? Fine, then I'll call the police. - What the fuck?! I'll take care of it. Just forget about it. - But, Tatsuo... Look, you've never given a shit about me, and now isn't the time to start! You just pay attention to other people's children. I teach the piano to children. It's not my fault. If it's not your fault, then neither is this. It's a little late to start playing Mommy. I'm telling you this because I care about you. You say you care, but you don't show it! Tell the school whatever you want. I'm quitting. Tatsuo... what are you doing just sitting there? Pay attention to the job. You're the worst employee I have. When I was your age, I tried a little harder. I got kicked out of high school and did time at a reformatory. But I worked hard, and now I have my own company - a small one. Give it your best - I'll look out for you. Get back to work. I wish things were fun, like before. Why don't you move back in? Will you let us get married? Honey, marriage isn't that simple. You need money. Can't you wait till you're at least 20? No, I can't wait. That's why I moved out in the first place. Think about this a bit more carefully. 'Carefully'? You're the one to talk... You got divorced. Your father's the one who wanted the divorce. Don't blame dad. - Where are you going? - Home. You shouldn't talk down to her. You're a bad mother. I'm not a bad mother. What a thing to say! Shut up, you selfish bitch! I've done my best for you two. I don't want to talk to you! Don't go! I got into it with some high school kids the other day... It was more trouble than it was worth, so I got down on my knees and paid them off. That's pathetic! You've done your share of time in prison, I reckon. You're right. You're better off living clean. I'm talking to you, Tatsuo... don't wind up like us. You want to get married, don't you? Eat. You should get married sometime, too. What did you do at the junior high school? I want to hear you say it. You think if you don't talk, I won't know! Idiot! Tokyo Juvenile Correction Centre That hurts. Lighten up a little. Don't be so rough. - Hey, Mr. Katagiri. - Tatsuo. They let me off with probation. Thanks for your help. That's good. I hope you've learned your lesson. Get to work. - Get your act together. - Oh yeah, sorry. Thanks. Tatsuo! When did you get out? Our promise? To save up enough money to get married by the time we're 20. Why do you have to nag me all the time? Because if I don't, you forget. I said I was sorry. Drop it. I'm going home. - She cries for you. - What? She says she gets lonely when you're not around. If you're going to go, then go. Hey, Tatsuo. What do you want? What's wrong with you? I've been worried about you. Shut your mouth. Go fuck your whore or something! Oh, Rina, you're home. Don't you think that skirt is a little short? Oh, gross. You dirty old man! God, Tatsuo, you don't hit your own mother! Girls need hitting sometimes! If you don't stop, I'll call your father. Then call him! He's probably humping his whore, even as we speak! You make me sick! Bitch! Tatsuo... Grow up. Hitting your own mother is just plain wrong. You should be grateful to her for taking care of you for this long. The bitch hasn't done a thing for me. Imbecile! You might think so now, but you're wrong. When I was finally grateful to my parents, they were already long dead. Fine, then. Starting next month, I'm going to start giving part of your pay check to your mother. You should learn to respect your parents while you're still young. Otherwise it'll be too late. Is that acceptable to you, Mrs. Osugi? Yes, thank you. Tatsuo, you listen to Mr. Katagiri, and do what he says. Shut the fuck up! I've gotta save up to get married. I promised Kayoko. You really want to get married? Then work hard so you can take care of yourself. Then I'll give you a raise. You got that, Tatsuo? A present for getting out of the hole? Here. - What is it? - A teacup. It's the same as mine. Thanks. We have to talk. You two wait here. This place is a mess! It stinks too! Hey, there... What the... Ain't you Tatsuo? Oh, Shimada. What the hell are you doing? So this is the kind of work you ended up in? You really hit rock bottom! This job is actually kind of interesting. It's satisfying to see the work completed. I feel the same way. I'm just rank and file now, but pretty soon, I'll be a made man. I'm getting married - to Kayoko Matsuyama. With Kayoko? Hey, that's great. I'd never go off and do something dumb like getting married, though. You play the hand you're dealt. Getting married will probably make you even gloomier. You should join the syndicate. Be a yakuza. Walk with your head high. It's good, it is. Look... +2 million. You'd like it. Oh, by the way, who was that - the girl that you were dating in junior high? Hey, we're done here. Let's go for a drink. Understood, chief. Uh, chief, this guy's an old friend... - Can I bring him along tonight? - Fine. This is one of my boys, could you leave him be? No harm in having a little drink now and again, is there, Katahira? OK, laddie, we're outta here. Thanks, chief. Let's go. Mr. Katahira, this ain't kosher. It's out of my hands. Let's clean up. With an introduction from Shimada, you could make 30 grand a day. 20 workdays in a month, that's 600K. Not bad, huh? You could buy a nice watch like this in no time. How about it? Hey, babe, let's liven things up a little. Akemi! Yoko! Come over here. Pleased to meet you. Maybe I'll sit here. Wow, you're handsome! What's your name? Osugi. - How are you handling it? - So-so. Is that all? I was told 3 grand a day. Patience, twerp! You'll be making that haul in good time. - The public bath sure is nice. - Yeah. - Let's go even after we're married. - Sure. - How much have you saved? - What? Your savings. You were practically seven days a week, so I figured you probably have quite a bit. All you talk about is money. Gee, I just want to marry you ASAP! Once we have children, we're going to need money. What? I missed my period. You're joking. - You're mad? - I'm not. OK, I'll be right over. Tatsuo, watch the office while I'm gone. You don't have to watch reception, but answer the phone. Listen up when I'm talking to you! Damn, some day I'm going to kill that prick... This one's the best. This one. Step right up, babe. Oh... What are you doing here? Yeah, uh, I changed jobs. Changed jobs? What happened to laying tiles? I quit. The pay sucked. Tatsuo, I give up. I trusted you. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. No, you don't! I'm going to quit sniffing glue. I promise. Really? Absolutely. I'm done. And the yakuza? I want to quit, but they'd kill me. Why did you want to join the yakuza? I thought if I saved some money, we could get married. But you piss it all away! You haven't saved a dime! If I make chief, life will be a lot more comfortable for you, too. What are you talking about? I don't want money if we have to make it that way. That hurt! Oh, go ahead. Hit me if it makes you feel better. Maybe I'll work in a 'soap land'. A sex worker? Are you nuts? If I don't do something, we're not going to be able to get married. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Can I quit the organization? Get up. I said, get up. Tatsuo, get a hold of yourself. My mind's made up. What's with the big talk? Calm down. We'll talk about it after we have a drink. The life isn't always easy at first. Give it another stab. You probably need a little money. To keep the ladies happy... live with style. You try to run, we'll put you in a block of concrete and dump you at the bottom of the fucking ocean! Hey, feeling better? Tatsuo decided to stick with the gang, didn't you? You're a hard worker. Why the long face, Tatsuo? I can't diss it. Life is cold and cruel outside the gang. I understand that. That's why I hereby dedicate my life to the gang. Use your noodle. You'll rise high in the ranks. This calls for a toast. Cheers! The 'Ryujin' gang? We need a bunch of young guys, and you're to organize them. You report directly to us. I can just form my own gang? How many do you need? Just tap your friends and acquaintances. Think big. You got it? What do I do after I assemble them? Motherfucker, stop asking so many questions! What does the organization do? It's a fighting unit to be formed in this area. It's called the Ryujin gang. I, of course, am the chairman. Ozaki, you can be the managing director. I can really be the managing director? - Ikeda, you're his assistant. - Yes. Anyhow, call all your friends and get them to join. - Two or three? - Think big! The bigger the better. Right. - You gotta problem? - No, I'm fine. - You too? - OK. Hey, hey, hey, get in there! Let go of the bag, already! Pony up with the cash! Is that all you got? If he finds out you're screwing his girl, you're dead. It'll be fine. Right? Is he listening? Hey, wow, I got the three dragons! You suck at this game. It's your third loss! Something ain't right about this. What are you trying to say? Tatsuo, some things are OK to say, others are not. You don't wanna make Kimura mad at you. Not at all. You have no idea! What the fuck?! You're home, after all. Your mom's such a bitch when we come over. I know you. Thank you for looking after my sister. Hey, you can join us, too. 'The Ryujin gang'. No, thanks. Look shit stain, I told you to join! It wasn't a question. OK. This will be our office. Seriously? No way! His parents are here. We'll come and go through the window. It'll be fine. Here you go. Whoa, look at that. A new record. Let's do it again. Right, I'll get in touch with you later, bye. Ozaki, we're coming up short this month with the biker gangs. What can we do? Osugi has been a hard-ass about collection recently. Maybe we can hold a meeting and get the bikers fired up. They have memorials and shit like that. - That's a pain in the ass. - What can ya do? Couldn't we put the squeeze on high-school girls, or something? - You're a honey. - Don't! Stop! Shut the fuck up! Look at this, everyone! Look! A good day for the Ryujin gang! Uh, I hate to ask, but could you cut my quota from next month? You're soft. No, it's tough out there. Can you do something? They say hard experience is like money in the bank. Don't sweat it, kid. You got a knack for this line of work. - 'A knack'? - Horse sense. Get in there, you piece of shit! I'm sorry, please forgive me. You dumb fuck! I'm surprised it took a month to catch you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't plan it this way. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You son of a bitch! Tatsuo, drink up. I'm buying tonight. Hey asshole, bring the knife! I'm counting on you for this one. Hey, let's go. - You've got it hard, too. - Why? You know what I mean. The chief made the Ryujin gang to make money for him, and to do his dirty work. You work for him, but he doesn't have to pay you. You're getting used, too. You two want to try it with a real, grown-up woman? You bet! Hey, lady, need a ride? What are you doing? Stop! Get your son out here right now! He's upstairs, isn't he? Just a moment. Please! Bring him out this instant! He's really not here. You're lying! I'm not even in touch with him. Please, go home, I beg you. Rape is just plain bad. You're right. What's the problem? It's fun. He's right. I want a piece too. Damn, he's gettin' into it! OK, you and me will get some. You keep quiet. She consented. I picked her up, she got in my car. Rape - I'd never stoop so low. Then why do you think she filed charges? I'm not lying. You gotta believe me. I'm going to repeat my question: where exactly did you meet her? We got off the hook just denying everything. It's kind of unreal. I told you, you do as I say and there won't be any fuck-ups. You're a stud! The cops are worthless. - You wanna do it again? - Seriously? They're the ones. I know they did it. Don't do anything rash. We'll catch their asses, sooner or later. Shall we do the usual? Turn over. Turn over. We're going to get what we want, one way or the other! Just let us do it! That high-school girl. Ride up alongside her, and knock her down. - Then what? - Then nothing. You disappear. - What will you do? - Have sex. - Are you all right? - Yes. Excuse me... Sorry for the trouble. Looks like you got a bad scrape there. Let me see. Ooh, this is bad. Here is fine. You don't have to take me any further. Don't worry, I'll take you home. But my home is far. That's OK, I have my bike. I'm a little worried about you, too. No, really, I'm OK. Shut up and come along quietly. I'm a yakuza. That other guy - he's my subordinate. One word from me and he'll burn your fucking house down. Don't do this! I've had enough of you. Come on. Stop! Ouch! You dirty bitch! You play nice, or I'll kill you right here. Hey, Ozaki, guess where I am? I scored me a hottie. You can have a piece of her, too. Come on over. - Hello. - Hello. Hurry up, assholes! Sorry. I'm going to return the bike. You watch her. God, he's late. Maybe he ditched us. It's cold. let's go to your place. Can we just go? Shit, yeah! He ain't coming back. Recently, I ran into Shimada - you know, that guy we went to junior high with? We had tea and talked about old times. What brought that up? Sorry. - Ain't you done yet? - Just a sec. You probably won't be going home tonight. You're lucky to have a home to go to. My parents always fought, and got divorced. They play me off each other, so I can't stand to stay with either of them. I feel bad for you. I'm lonely... Comfort me. Please stop. I want to stick a beer bottle in her, Mr. Osugi. Is that all right? Go for it! For God's sake, hold still! I want to stick in my nun chucks, Mr. Osugi. Nun chucks? Nothing wrong with that. Next up, please. Out of the way. Next up. Don't squirm, this is a tight fit! No way that's going in. You are taking this far too seriously! You're going too far with that. Get the practice sword. Hold her down tight. Get a good look. This is the important part. Could you give it a little push? Wanna try again? Wanna try again? You gotta be willing to undertake challenges. Let's give this a try. My god, it goes in! This is great! Unbelievable! Dude, that is beyond the pale! We've had our fun, what say we let her go? That probably best, but, gee... I think we should let her go, but if she goes to the cops, we'll be pinched. Then we'll keep her. That's probably for the best. First, we'll put the fear of God into her. Then we'll let her go. That's fine by me. But I will say, you are two cold-blooded bastards! Someone has to watch her. Okazi, we'll count on you for that. The rest of us are going for a barbecue. Good call! I'm hungry... Don't look at me that way. It's hard for me, too, sucking up to Osugi all the time. This is just between you and me, right? If you talk, I'll know. I'll let you go later. I told you not to look at me that way! Have you spoken with your father? It's hard to talk to him recently. Don't worry. Go home and tell him. I'll definitely finish today. Sorry. You've got a boyfriend. It's not like that. If you have, you have to let me know. I have to be ready for that special day. Your father worries about you, too. You're reading too much into this. These apples are good, aren't they, mom? "Hi mom, I'm at a friend's place. I'll be back in two or three days. "So don't worry." That's all you say. Try anything stupid and I'll kill you. Yes, hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, mom... it's me. Where are you? Misaki? I'm at a friend's place. I'll be home in two or three days. Misaki! Misaki! Let me go home! It won't be long. I promised didn't I? You have to let me go. I know, I know. Just keep quiet. You wanna play? One more time? Please let me go home. Eh? No way. I'm begging you, let me go. I promise not to tell the police. If I let you go, Osugi will kill me. Please! No. Emergency services, how can I help you? Please rescue me. First, tell me your name. Help me. Please tell me your name. Help me. Thought you could get away? Let's go. Yeah, my sister was playing a prank. I'm sorry for the trouble. That was a close shave, you bitch. You can't be bringing girls into the house at this time of night. Get the fuck outta here, twat! Nosy old hag! Don't you have to go home? She ran away from home. You want to be here, right? You see, you idiots? If she says she wants to stay, let it go. But her mother must be worried. She can't just not go home. I can't eat this shit! God, you're a lousy cook. Old man, gimme an ashtray... Hurry up! You could at least say thanks. Thanks. Hasn't this gone on long enough? It's not for us to decide. He said we would eventually let her go. That's not the problem. And how do you like being stuck at my house, 24/7? You got a point. Go home... I said you could go. Really? Well, maybe we should ask Mr. Osugi first... I said no such thing! I'm sorry. Try to run away, you bitch! I would have found you and beaten you to death. While there's still time... You bitch! If you escape, Mr. Osugi will have my ass! Who said you could let her go? You're hurting me! Let me go! Shut up, you old bitch! What are you doing? Teaching you a lesson. I'll make sure you never test us again. Now, it's time for the strip show! Get up! Let's get started! First, we'll start with the top. Ozaki, is this your first time? Who do you like the best? Answer me! Ozaki. Ozaki, go for it. Hey, Ozaki... What was that for? You can't fall in love without my permission! I'm not. - Really? - Really. OK, here's what we'll do. Instead of Ozaki, we'll punish you instead. Ikeda, take off her pants. Give me a lighter. And lighter fluid. I thought he might have come home. He hasn't. I'm sorry. He's been nothing but trouble for you. Please don't say that. You peed yourself. God almighty, stinking up the room! What kind of a freaky bitch are you? What are you doing there? Stop, you're going too easy on her! Wimp, wimp. You reek, bitch! Can I go to the bathroom? No, his parents are home. Go later. Please. Matsuyama, do something. Use this. Sing, prisoner. Put your heart into it. Prisoner, sing, Prisoner. Jesus, you're as limp as a rag. Get up, go over there. God, she stinks. Ikeda, your turn. Ozaki, you're up. You're last, Matsuyama. Hey, hey. Get up... She's out cold. She's faking. I'll wake her up. Water... Hey, she said something. What? Who cares? Water... water... Happy New Year! Although not such a happy New Year - I lost ten grand, playing Mah-Jong. That much? You can't sleep forever. She asked for water a minute ago. Then let her drink - her own piss. Get up! Hand me that. Hey, are you all right? Cheer up! - This is turning nasty. - Don't worry. I wonder if she's really all right. Don't nag me about every goddamn Little thing! I told you she was all right. Didn't I? You didn't. I did. Admit it. I said so. I said so. I said so. Enough! Let's go to the sauna. We'll break a sweat, get in the cold bath, it'll do us good. Come on. Come on, I said. Do your best... Do your best.... Do your best... Do your best... Hey, are you all right? Don't die. Stay strong. Do not die! Forget it. She's dead. Who the fuck said we should go to the sauna? It was you, Mr. Osugi. Oh my God, what have we done?! Mr. Osugi, what should we do? Let me think a second. What, are you fucking high? Say something! You're the head of this gang! Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? I quit! You hear me? I said I quit the Ryujin gang! Get your hands off me! What's up? I need to ask you for an oil drum and some cement. What for? Oh, yeah, well, I, uh, banged my car into the concrete fence at the office and I need to fix it. You don't need an oil drum to fix a fence. I'd wager you're going to stuff a body in the drum and seal it with concrete. I haven't sunk that low. I was just joking, but you should have seen your face! It's in the back. Take it. Great, thanks. How much do I owe you? The day I take money from you... It's really OK? Just quit the yakuza. Think about your mother, for a change. You stick with them for too long and, sooner or later, they're going to ask you to do a hit. Come back here. - This is hard, where's Matsuyama? - Not a job for two people. - He's our alibi. - I'll telephone him at the office. I understand that. Shut up! I said it would be all right, and it will be! Move your ass! Ozaki, give me a hand! Stuff her in deep? Move your ass! We're not going to push this thing to the opposite end. Isn't this far enough? I'm fed up with both of you. This is good enough. It's sealed tight. We take it to where I say we take it. What good will that do? What good will that do? Shut up and keep rolling, Shut up and keep rolling, you son of a bitch! I'm done! Keep pushing, you whiny asshole! It's been about two months since the last time we met. Sentencing is tomorrow. I guess you're right. More than twenty counts of rape, dozens of counts of theft - you've really run the gambit, haven't you? What are you trying to say? We met with Ozaki and Ikeda. How were they? Ozaki looked really thin. Why did you commit murder? We didn't intend to kill her, but... That family was completely innocent! What are you, some kind of a demon seed?! 'Family'? Do you still think you can duck this one? I only killed one person: the high-school girl. Just ask Ozaki. Hey, jailer! I wonder if they know how precious life is?
