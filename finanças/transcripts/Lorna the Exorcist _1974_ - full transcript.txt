What awful weather! Yes, I know. Really awful! And it's worse because in three days it's your birthday... and you want to spend it with friends in St Tropez! - How'd you know? - I've known you 18 years. - Let's see what your father says. - When's he back? Well, that depends on the airline strikes. - Papa! - Linda, my girl... - Hello, Marianne. - Hello. What have you two been up to without me? Getting bored. We've been waiting for you. Linda wants to spend her birthday in St Tropez. Of course darling! We'll go any place you want! - Flying's so unreliable! - What was the weather like in Rome? Great! - When will you let me come with you? - Me too! - Next time, we'll all go. I promise. - Fantastic! Where? - It's a surprise. - Tell us! - Rio de Janeiro, next month. - Great! I'll go. Really, daddy, I'm coming too? Only if you're a good girl and pass your exams. - For a trip to Rio, you bet I will! - Hello? - I'll even get straight A's in Latin! - Yes? Patrick, it's for you. - So, we have a deal? - Of course! - Patrick! It's for you! - Yes, I'm coming. It's a woman. She already called twice and she won't tell her name. A woman, eh? Hello, I'm listening! Hello Patrick, you dirty bastard. You thought you'd got away? You recognise me? It's Lorna... Wait a second. I hope you haven't forgotten our meeting next Monday. - Impossible, I'll be in St Tropez. - No you won't. We're meeting in the new resort town in Camargue. Go there now and book a room in the new hotel. Come... Come with me. Come in. Come in, please. I'd like to know who you are. Where are you from? Try to remember, Madam. Search deep inside. Make an effort! Please. The police found you unconscious. In a lonely place, far from the road. You were in a coma for three weeks. In the last few days you seem much better. Please, tell me who you are. Maybe you are in the power of someone? Someone is controlling you and I want to know who. You must tell me. Who is it? Who controls you? Tell me. Answer, please. Who controls you? Search your memory, tell me who it is. Answer! Please answer. - I...wa... - What? Lorna! Take her back. Help her to her room. Lorna! Where are you? Where are you Lorna? Lorna, help me! I abandoned you. Yes, I abandoned you because you betrayed me. You deserve your punishment. Condemned to the void forever. Why are you so reluctant now? I feel so down now... Besides Carole, Laurence and Isabelle are already there... ...and suddenly you decide to go to Camargue. Why? Why there? It's my birthday. All my friends are in St Trop. I'll go alone if I must. Linda, that's enough! I'm your father! I decide where we go. Don't tell me what to do! Calm down, darling. Calm down, love. I don't care if it's St Tropez, Camargue or the suburbs of Paris... ...just as long as we're together. But why this change of mind? It's strange... You know how sad it can be down there this time of year. I have to, for business. Don't let her cry, just explain to her nicely. - Linda, we must talk - Leave me alone. Go away. Linda, you'll be 18 on Monday. You're already a woman and yet you cry. You behave like a real kid, darling. - I must go to Camargue. - Yes, you must... To meet a girlfriend, right? Linda... Linda! - What do you mean? - Leave me alone. Listen, Linda... Listen... On Monday you'll be 18, you're a woman, yet you act like a kid. - I must go to Camargue. - Right, to meet one of your girlfriends! Linda! Right but I didn't know one of these... ...girls could be more important than me. You're wrong, Linda. It's nothing like that. And it's hard for me. - Do you believe me? - What is it? I can't talk about it now. But one day, I promise I'll explain it all... OK? Yes, daddy. I'm sorry... I was acting like a child... But now... Now I shall act like a woman. Let's go to Camargue, or anywhere! Thank you, my girl. I'll make it up to you, you'll see. - Oh, can't you wait a little? - And I also forgot my sun lotion! Ok, we'll take care of that! I booked a suite, name of Mariel. Very good... Can't find you, Mr Bariel. - No, Mariel... - Oh, sorry! - Mariel... - Right! Marius, get the bags. Welcome to hotel Frantel. - I'll show you the room myself. - Thank you. It's so pretty! The larger room for yourself. - Very good. - Thank you, sir. You have all you need, a nice sea view... A wonderful bathroom, a smaller room for the young lady. What more could you want, eh? - Thank you, Mr Bariel. - You're welcome. What lovely flowers! There's a note... "To Linda on her birthday, from her mother." Thanks, mum... So nice! I'll go look at my room. - Did you send the flowers? - No, I didn't. Who do you suppose it was? No idea. Maybe the hotel. - Marianne, hurry up love - I can't go any faster! Linda, come on! Will you be ready soon? - But I'm ready now! - Oh yes, I see... Hurry up! No, it's for me. Yes? It's Lorna, you swine. Come at once to the place where we first met. I hope you remember. I can't come right now. I'm with my family. We're going to have dinner. - Come at once or you'll be sorry. - Alright. - Where are you going, Patrick? - I won't be long. Where we first met... None of these huge buildings existed back then. L'Ecrin was a small sea food stall on the beach. The casino wasn't here. It was in a nearby village. I was just a poor guy stumbling through life. And you Lorna, some 19 years ago, opened the doors for me to become what I am today. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets, please... Place your bets. Thank you. No more bets... No more bets! Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets... Place your bets... Thank you. No more bets! No more bets... Place your bets! Place your bets... Thank you. How much do I owe you, please? Good evening. What do you want? I want your daughter. Tomorrow. This must be our table. - It's nice and lively. - Sure is. - What do you want? - Scotch. - It's cheaper to buy a bottle. - OK, a bottle then. - Want to dance? - You bet! Back to our seats! - Already? - Follow your father. You're getting old... Thanks. - Cigarette? - You let me smoke now? - If you want to. - I don't like that. I have a call to make, darling. - Do you know Miss Lorna Green's number? - No, Sir, I don't. Give me the phone directory, then. Right away, Sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello. Information? I need Miss Lorna Green's number, please... Lorna Green... Looking for me? Yes, I am. You'll never have my daughter. Not at any price. Lorna... Come. Come... Lorna... Lorna! Come... I'm ready... I'm waiting... Marianne! Marianne! I was worried. Where were you? Worried... why? Us girls have to go pee pee sometimes. - Good evening. The key to 215 please. - Good evening Mr Bariel... You have a telegram. Meet me outside the casino right now. If you don't come, you will be bankrupt by tomorrow. You two go up, I have to go out for a while. And only open the door if it's me. I won't be long. - Excuse me... - Yes, Mr Bariel? Can you find me a revolver? - A real one? - Of course. But Mr Bariel, even if it's bad news... - Don't do anything stupid! - It's not like that. I won't use it, it's just for safety. Ok but if you're in trouble I can ask the hotel detective to help. Even better, a friend of mine is a cop... He could help you if... No, it's not like that! I just need a revolver. But it's late, Mr Bariel, everywhere is shut. - Here. - I'll do my best. And bring it up to me when you have it, however late it is. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. I don't drink. You have changed, then... I don't recognise you anymore... You are still the same, though. Yes. Sit down, please. Why did you ask me to come? You know very well. I want your daughter. Tomorrow... The day of her 18th birthday, as we agreed. Yes. Please don't ask me that. Not yet. I love her. She is my only child. We agreed a pact. You knew this would happen. Yes. It was easy at the time. She wasn't born then. Easy for you, but I kept my promises. You were in despair, almost suicidal. I met you... I offered you happiness, wealth... but... with one condition... her! I have waited 18 years. Now she belongs to me. You won't have her, do you hear me? You won't have her. I don't know what horrible things you want to do to her... or what ceremonies you want her to take part in... but I will fight you to the death for her. You won't have her. Do you know what you're risking? That I can ruin you... Destroy, at one fell swoop, all that I have built up for you. Your threats change nothing. Maurizius! Maurizius... Throw him out. - What's wrong with you? - It's nothing. - Is there a clinic or a Chemist's here? - Yes, right nearby. Wait, I'll show you. - You're hurt! - That's not bad really. - Jo Jo, I'm going with him. - Don't be too long. I appreciate your help, Miss. - Who is it? - Open, it's me. Please, Linda! I don't understand... Why do you come back so late? Not before her. - Linda, you can go now. - At last I can go to sleep! What's going on, Patrick? These last two days it's like you're hiding something. You're not yourself. You're lying to me, Patrick. Don't start... Earlier tonight, you told us to stay here... to wait for you and lock the door... and not to open it to anyone else. Why all this drama? - I'll explain it all later. - I can't accept your silence. Put yourself in my place! How can a wife respect and love her husband if she can't trust him? What is it that's scaring you? Who or what? What's going on? Nothing's going on. - You're lying. - Why do you think that? Someone or something here is scaring you. Nobody at all. Tell me why you went out if you want our marriage to last. Yes, I'm scared. There's someone... Look, I didn't want to worry you. - It's a woman you knew before? - Yes. She's trying to harm us... to harm me. But I won't let her. - The one who called? - Yes. She wants... She wants to destroy us. But she won't succeed. Maybe I've heard enough, darling. - You understand me? - Yes, my love. I swear. I understand. Something from your past returns to haunt you, right? Yes! I want you to know... Whatever happens nothing can destroy our love. I'll always be here for you. For better or for worse. I'll be here if you need me. Thank you, my sweet. - What is it? - Nothing. Let me see. - You're hurt. - It doesn't matter. I had a fight. With who? Listen, my love, no more questions. I will explain. When this is all over, I will explain everything. Alright, darling, you are right. Explain it to me later. I will. Hello, Mr Bariel... Sorry for disturbing you... but I found that gun for you. Thank you. Thanks very much. - I hope you won't use it. - Don't worry. Goodnight. - Who was that? - A hotel employee... Marianne! What's going on? Marianne! Marianne! What's wrong? What the hell's going on? Marianne! Marianne! What the hell is that? Take it easy now... easy. Please, Marianne, take it easy. Take it easy, darling... What's wrong with mummy? There, there, it's all over. Calm down now. What's going on, dad? Marianne, please... Listen, Marianne... Get me a damp towel. - What is it? - Nothing. Just a nightmare. Go back to bed now. Here... Calm down now. It's alright... Now... Now... That's better now. Marianne... My love. Linda! Linda, my child, listen to me. This is the voice of your mother calling you. A mother who has long desired to be with you... ...to know you. I am Lorna, your mother. I have chosen to approach you first through your subconscious mind... to gain your confidence. The meaning of my words will enter the deepest parts of your mind as you sleep. You cannot know how long I have yearned for this moment. Before you awaken, I want to savour the joy of this first Contact with you. Often have my thoughts visited your soul, without you knowing. I was living for you and you were living for me. You are my possession, mine own. Please don't be scared, I'm your mother! Listen! I have come to offer you the power... the right of life and death over human beings for ever. Nothing can stand in your way. All your desires for destruction or creation will come true. Listen to the words of your mother. From this day you shall do all that you like, all that you desire. I give you my powers, as I received them. I am your mother and it is through me alone that you came to be. Thanks to my infinite power you were born. But alas you could not be nurtured in my own womb... ...for I am sterile, as you will be. And yet you were born from my desire. Thanks to me your father knew pleasure... ...your mother was impregnated, and you came into this world. Now I must reveal to you the secrets of the past. For you will continue my work. You are summoned by destiny. Linda, my child... I must now reveal. ...how you were chosen to succeed me long before you were born. I know my hour must soon come. But you are here to take up the flame. Don't look at me with frightened eyes. I bring you ultimate power, I told you. Many would envy you now. From afar I watched you grow And saw with joy that you were worthy of this task. But first I must tell you what happened 19 years ago. Your mother and father lived a miserable life. Stuck in this forgotten corner of Camargue. Where a new city was just being built ...to create something out of this solitude. Your father was desperate. All his work and his ambition had come to nothing. One day he headed again to the old casino. ...hoping to try his luck. Place your bets, please... Place your bets. No more bets, please. No more bets, please. No more bets, please. Please place your bets. Place your bets! Please place your bets. No more bets, please. Ladies and gentlemen, please place your bets. For Madame. Please place your bets. Place your bets! Place your bets! - A tip for the staff. - Thank you, sir. No more bets, please. For Madame. Ladies and gentlemen, please place your bets. Place your bets! Ladies and gentlemen, please place your bets. No more bets, please. - For the staff. - Thank you. - For the employees. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please place your bets. Please place your bets. No more bets, please. Excuse me. - For the service. - Thank you. Thank you. May I buy you a drink? The drinks are on me. At my place. Thank you again. Why did you help me? I was expecting you. But how could you know I was going to be there? ...that I even existed? I just knew. You are like some mysterious, compelling character... ...from the pages of a fairy tale. That's what I am. Your lips are real, though... So are yours. We had to meet... It was fated. This was meant to happen. For you, to improve your lot... For me, to continue my mission. I don't understand you. You are marvellous. Where are you from? From far away. I have a mission to accomplish with you. You have been chosen by my Lord and Master. Who? What are you talking about? I have an offer to make you. Soon you will come into great wealth... and find great happiness. But... ...on one condition. I don't believe in God, the Devil, or satanic pacts. Faust was just the creation of an author's mind. But today you won a large sum at the casino. Thanks to whom? Thanks to me. That's true. That was but a small proof of my powers. I'm listening. We will make love... but I am sterile, like all who come from beyond... We will climax together... Then you'll return to that cheap hotel where you live with your wife... You'll make love to her at once. In 9 months, she will bear a child. A girl... That girl will belong to me. When she is 18, I will come for her. She will be my daughter. I don't understand. Don't try to understand. If you accept, in 30 days you will be immensely rich. Wealth, in exchange for a being who doesn't exist... who is not even born yet. Do you accept? I want you. - Do you accept? - I accept! The key to 14. - Your wife is upstairs. - Thanks. - Hello, love. - Hello... Where've you been? What took you so long? Nothing to worry about... On the contrary... - I have good news for us. - Really? Things are going to change for us. - Are you happy? - Yes! Linda... Now you know why I call you my daughter. Why I care so much for you. Now begins your initiation. Be calm. Don't be afraid of me. Don't be afraid of your mother. I will transfer to you all my powers. My infinite powers. Trust me. What are you doing? What are you doing? My daughter... Linda, my child. Linda, my lovely child. My daughter! My lovely child... My daughter... My daughter! Oh my daughter! My daughter... Oh, that's good. Good... Mummy, that's so good. Oh Linda... Hello, daddy. Are you alright, darling? I'm fine. Come in! You're not embarrassed to see me naked, are you? I was afraid. I saw blood on your sheets. But daddy, us girls have that same problem every month. Sure... Marianne! What's wrong? Marianne, answer! Oh my love... You called, sir? I need a doctor, or a coroner, my wife has just died. Hold on... I'm sorry, Linda. Come... Come to me. Come... Thank you, Patrick. I was bound to be killed by you. It was written that my task should end today. But already there is someone to take my place. Your... Your daughter... Linda! Quick, doctor! Patient in room 7 had an attack. I think she's dead. Come quick! What are you doing? How long have you had that? Who gave you that bracelet? She did, when she came to see me. But who? Lorna? Answer me. Was it Lorna? Linda! You're so beautiful! Why did you do that, my child? Why? I am not your child... I am Lorna... Oh no... No... No...
