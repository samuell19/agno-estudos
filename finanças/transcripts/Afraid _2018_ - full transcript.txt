Well, I'm just really glad we're able to get away, you know? Okay, you ready? I can't see anything. Right foot, right foot, right foot. I know how to use my leg. You got it? Okay. You're gonna wobbly. Whoa, okay, wait, wait. Okay. I'm gonna wheel you around. Whoa. And you're gonna step with me. I don't know where I'm stepping. Just relax. Okay, okay. I wanna look, let me look. Where am I? Slowly turn. Okay, tell me when I can open them. All right, I just wanna do this for fun. Okay. I can't see anything. One, two, open. Oh, what? The whole thing? Yeah. This whole place? I told you. Oh. Okay, just... Okay. Just check it out. I'll grab the guitar. I'll get it in a sec. All right. Now, just watch your step. Okay. Oh, the balcony's great. This is amazing. Okay. Okay. Oh, oh my God. It's not there. Maybe by under the mat they meant not under the mat. Hello? Let's try to get it open. Open the door, babe. Yes, we did it. Whoa. Just like the website. Like a log cabin. Baby, shut the door. Oh, my God. This place is amazing. Yeah? It's huge. Look at this kitchen. Have I done well? Yeah, babe. Let's get some air in here. Oh, my God. I don't have words to explain what I think. This is fucking amazing. Have I done well? Yeah, you've done more than well. What's over here? I'm gonna check out the other balcony. Okay. Babe, there's a porch swing! Be out in a sec! Lanny! Yeah! This is amazing. Look at this view. Have you done it? I'm gonna have to get some timber. Timber. For the fire. For the fire. For the fire. Timber for the fire. Do you want a water or anything? Yeah, I think so. My chest feels a little tight. Yeah, that's the thing. It's high altitude, so just keep your waters up. Here you go. Okay. I can't see anything. This is a great setup. Hmm? I can cook and chat through this little nook. Or you can cook and chat, depending on who... I was gonna say, I'll probably cook. Depending on who dominates the cooking. And babe, guess what. What? Since the home has no cell service, I made sure we had Wi-Fi. Thanks. You're the best. Yes, I am. You know what the password is? I don't think there is one. No one else around I guess. This place is perfect. I'm impressed that you found this place. Yeah. Not that you're not good at finding places, but you know what I mean. Yeah. And it's beautiful. It's so quiet. When we go away, it takes me a day. Like to get rid of that anxious seed. Babe, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like I'm... Well, I haven't seen pictures from the website. I will probably be a little bit annoying for the next few hours. Hey, you, over there in the kitchen. You don't need a cookbook, baby doll. No, but look, honey. Ah. Lucy's gonna read it with me. Well, if it's good, we'll but it back in town. We should just steal it. That's bad karma. I'm gonna do my best to do nothing for three days, but chase you around the house, try and sleep with you. It's not gonna work. I like it here. You do? Yeah. You wanna stay? We could stay is all I'm saying. That'd but nice, but we can't with... Wouldn't be nice, it'd be awesome. Think about it. Back in a sec. Really? At some point. Do you remember the first time we met? A Halloween party. How mad would you have been if I was dressed as Steve Irwin? Uh, I would've... Would you have been so pissed? Just be honest, you can tell me. You... Crikey. You have absolutely lost it. You ran away. I stood near a fridge for 45 minutes, talking to myself or any other idiot who'd come near me. And then, remember? And then I came over and said something like, what time, I think I asked you what time it was. I had nothing. Like, I hadn't said that saying since maybe second grade. I'd hadn't heard it since the late '80s, yeah. Like it was so juvenile and ridiculous and you started laughing at me. I love it when you talk. That's nice. Most people tell me I talk too much. I love how much you talk. Keep saying it. I love a chatty gal. Keep say... Hey, it's only a bear. I'll protect you, you know that. Okay? Promise? No joke. Promise? You won't let anything happen? With all my mighty skills. Okay. This is my little ditty for you. You can play with your eyes closed. Yeah, of course. Here, baby. Can't believe you wouldn't like me if I was American. That's a joke. Gonna talk about that later, you know? I could really get used to this. Are you crying right now, because of my guitar playing? No. No. You're gonna... Gotta take these off, come on. I love you, baby. So much. I thought I heard something. It's late, baby. What are you doing? Didn't you hear that? What? No. It was so loud, George. Come back to bed. All right? You awake? I want an ice cream Sunday. Ah. What time is it, baby? With pretzels. Since when do you like to hike? We're in hike-country. Okay. Mm-hmm. Whatever you want. Oh, look at you. You're like a... Yeah, exactly. You're like Superman. Okay. Begin. All right? Whoa. I'm gonna get some water. Kill yourself before we get on the trail. Wrong step. All right. How you feeling? All right? Show me your leg. Mmm, mm. Should I touch it? It was a little more intense than I thought. You always your after new experiences. That was new. Did you like it? Really? What? Don't get shitty. I don't wanna talk about this again. I don't think we've talked about it once. You've been fine with it. You've known about it for so long. We just haven't talked about it. We haven't even... But you've known about it. You've never brought I up before to talk about it. If it was a thing, you would've said something when I told you about it. This is, this is important to me and I've told you that. You saying that it's not gonna work means it's not gonna work. I'm just being realistic. I understand you're being realistic. I'm telling you long-distance relationships, they don't work. You go away, it's like... You're making it not work, George It'll fall apart within three months and then I'm just giving you a heads up that that's what's gonna happen. I want you to say that I understand it's important to you and I'll be there for you through it. I do, I do. I just feel like there's 100 schools. You've got into the top five schools probably in the world. Why do you have to pick the one that's a million miles away? But the one I wanna go to is the be... It's a million miles away and that gives us no chance of surviving, that's what... You saying no chance of surviving means there's no chance of surviving. That's what I'm saying. There's 100 schools, you've got into the top five schools. There's 100 schools, you've got into the top five schools. Gives us no chance of surviving. That's what I'm... You saying no chance of surviving, means there's no chance of surviving. Means there's no chance of surviving. What are you doing? What's your name? You know my name. Stop videoing me, creep. No. Will you come to dinner with me tonight? No. Why not? I told you. I have a boyfriend. Please? I'm sorry. I just wanted this all to be perfect, you know? I wanted us to be perfect. One more thing. You're a terrible hiker. You are. We have liftoff. We have liftoff? Uh-huh. Can I be your little helper? Wait, baby, can you do that one? I love this record. It's kind of like the one thing we both realize we both like. I am proposing a toast. Official toast to the weekend. To us and to being happy and being together forever, not arguing about how we do it. Agree? Hey, Alanna, it's me. Call me. I wanna hear about your trip. Bye. Please leave a message after the tone. Hello. Hi. You have a good sleep? I like it during the day. Yeah. - A lot better. - I'm noticing that. I don't like it at night. Options. There's bacon or sausage. Okay. Um, whatever you want. Really? Yeah, you're making me breakfast. Okay, it's gonna be whatever I don't burn. Okay. 10 minutes. Okay, can't wait. Got a hold of my mom. Oh, really? Yeah, you know how she gets when I don't talk to her for a day. Fresh Valencia orange juice? Thank you. Continental breakfast. This looks amazing. Thank you very much. Need my fork. I could get used to this. I, for one, am enjoying being off the grid. Yeah? Yeah, away from everything. Yeah, it's kinda nice, you know, not being glued to your phone. Yeah, and plus, I'm your only focus. I'm also cooking dinner tonight. Wow. Right? That's amazing. Yeah, I'm stepping it up. I can't wait. Next, we gotta go to the store, get a few more things. I'm thinking we could go for a bit of a drive. A really nice little drive, like through the mountains, about 20 miles. I'd rather just stay here. Is that okay? Don't wanna relax in the car with me? I just like wanna read my book and sit out in the sun, you know? It's okay, really. Yeah. Okay, lovey, I'm off. Okay. You don't wanna come? No, I don't... It's nice, I wanna relax a little bit. All right, see you in a bit. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God. Come here, come here. You know, one thing. Honey? Hmm? I thought this might be like more romantic, us coming out here. Not meaning to be weird, but I just... I think this is romantic. Yeah? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I think it's totally romantic. You gonna get that? It's just Denise, calling about her boy problems. I don't feel like talking to her for the next two hours, you know? Our last night. Why is Denise all of a sudden calling you all the time. I don't know. That's never happened. Mid-life crisis. Pick it up next time. Yeah, well I turned it off. I don't wanna talk to her. You've been way more interested in your phone than you have been with me. You can keep pushing it, but I turned my phone off. I'm sorry, it shouldn't... You're more than welcome to talk to her. I'd love to hear what she has to say. I turned my phone off, so it was rude that I even had it. I'm really sorry. We've had an amazing time, don't ruin it. Don't ruin it. Hi. Hi there. You look cute. You're not actually reading this book. I'm just touching up on a few things, that's all. We are in the woods. We're in the woods with a book, a giant book about medicine. I ate way too much pasta. Can I talk to you? Of course. You can always talk to me. I know we've been talking about you leaving, but I wanna talk about it properly, okay? In all seriousness, what do I need to do to make you stay? I'm not joking, I don't wanna laugh about it. I wanna be as serious as I can be, without sounding like a dickhead. You've known about this for so long and it's never been a conversation and it's never been something where you have asked me stay. And I know, of course, you want me to stay, but this is like a really big deal to me and something that's really important. Now we have this weekend where it's supposed to be you and I and it's like... Yeah, but maybe... That's the thing that we're talking about the whole time. I just think... And I just, I don't understand. Can I say something? Of course I love you. This isn't about questioning if I love you or not. But I wanna go to school. Just as long as you know, you saying you wanna go to school... Is important. No, it's saying you wanna break up. That's not what I'm saying. First of all, I haven't once said to you that I wanna break up with you. I haven't said I'm moving, I'm going to school, we're done. No, you're saying you wanna be apart for one to two years and we'll work it out. No, and you can visit me, I can visit you. That's bullshit. It doesn't work. Because you're saying it's not gonna work. All that says to me is like go and live it. And why wouldn't you want that? Because I'm telling you I love you and I wanna be together with you. I wanna make this relationship mean something more than just like fucking around. Like, that's not what I want this to be. I wanna try and... I've never loved anyone like I love you. I can say that. I'm leaving, George. I'm going away. Okay, so, we're finishing. It's the same. I want you to understand that's how I see it. And if you're cool with that, then there's nothing to talk about. Yeah, nothing to talk about. That's cool. Good chat. I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight. George, George, George! What? Come in, come into the bedroom. Come into the bedroom. Who did that? We're leaving, we're leaving. What the fuck is this? We're leaving, we're leaving right now. We're leaving. Don't fucking believe it. Stay here, we're leaving in 30 seconds. George. Ow. George, George. Right. Just let me... Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Let me look at it. Ow. Okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just get in the car. Let's get the fuck out of here. What the fuck's happening? Aw, come on. What's going on? Why isn't the car turning on? What's happening? Fucking what? Fuck! What? Battery's gone. What? It's gone. There's nothing, no fucking battery. There's no battery in the car? We're walking, we're walking right now. We're walking on my ankle? Are you... Yes, try it. Look, babe. I don't care about some pain. We're not staying here. No, I can't. Just trust me, just trust me. Please, listen to me, I can't, I can't move. I can carry you, I can carry you to the... Please, please, please listen to me, I can't. I can't, it hurts. I can carry to the road and we can hitch. What, 100 milles? You can carry me 100 miles? What are we gonna do? Sorry, just try. Just try, I'm just saying try. You can half walk, I can lift you, we can walk, okay? Now just try putting a little... I can't, I can't. I can't, I really can't. I can't, I'm sorry, I can't. It really hurts. It really hurts, I can't. Get back in the car. I'm calling the cops. No, don't leave. Come here, please don't leave. Please don't leave me in this car. I'll be 30 seconds, please just wait. Please don't leave me in this car. What is the... Listen to me, we have no choice. Your ankle is fucked, we can not walk. The car is not moving. Look at me, look at me. I'll be 30 seconds. If anything happens, call out. Phone's not working, we got nothing. Try again. Try the phone again. Keep calling, George. Stop asking me to fucking keep calling. Look, I can't get service on the phone. The Wi-Fi must be down, the landline's not working. None of the phones are working. I seriously think I could carry you at least 20 miles. You're gonna wait here. We've gotta walk! Seriously. Hey. George, come here. Okay, just fucking, give me a fucking break. Please, stop yelling at me. Give me a break. Stop yelling at me, please. I'm sorry. Look at me. I can't go back in that house and I can't walk. What do you wanna do? We are gonna sit in this fucking car until we figure something out. I don't know, but we're not gonna get... We're gonna fucking freeze to death out here. We have no battery, no way to roll up the car windows. We could try and walk, we could walk to the road, we could fuck... Babe, my leg... This is not the... I'm sorry. I can't walk. I can't go back in that house. Okay, fine, we'll stay in the car. Someone has to come. I mean, like garbage-men, recycling, someone. Anyone. Listen to me. Shut the door. We've gotta stop screaming at each other. Okay? Okay, we've gotta think straight. Okay. Okay, we've gotta put this bullshit together. Who did you rent this house from? Do you know? William Thurman. William, William Thurman. Okay. Look, I did it online. Okay. I've got his details. I've got his number. Got it all in an E-mail. William Thurman. William Thurman, okay. George, tell me we're gonna be okay. If I have to sit out here with you for a week, I will. All right? I have to sit here over a year, will. I have to hunt rabbits, grab 'em by a little pole and feed you in the car, I will. Not gonna let anything happen to you, ever. I love you. We're good. He rolled the windows down before he took out the battery. Why is he doing this? I don't know. What if no one comes? What if no one comes to find us. We've been in this car for so long and it's fucking freezing. Come here. I'm so cold. What was that? It's nothing, it's nothing. Just focus on me. I'm scared he's out here with us. We need to go back to the house. I don't wanna go inside, but we have to go back to it. But I don't know what's in the house. What if we go in and lock all the doors? And we lock everything out? Please go inside. Make sure no one's in there. You can't leave my side. Okay. Here you go. We have to move faster. We have to go fast. Okay. Check the bedroom. It's all right. Just breathe, just breathe for me, come here. Just breathe. All right. Okay. Hey, what's this? Just wait there. I just need to check the circuit breaker, okay? It's gotta be downstairs in the basement. I've checked the rooms. No one's in the house. Just stay right here. Okay. And if you hear anything, just... Okay. I'll be back, okay? It's cool. George, George, I'm gonna get my cellphone. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Please work. Come on. Fuck. 911, what's your emergency? Oh, my God. I'm in a house, I rented a house with my boyfriend in the woods and someone's here trying to kill us. He's torturing us. Please. I'm badly injured and we have no way out of here. Can you tell me where the suspect is? No, but he's been in the house. What's the address? Can't you track the call? I don't understand. Ma'am, what's your location? I'm like 80 miles away from the highway, away from the city and the power's out, all the lights are off, and the battery from my car is gone. My phone's breaking, hello?
