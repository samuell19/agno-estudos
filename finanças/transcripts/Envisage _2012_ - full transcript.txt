WHY ARE YOU IMAGINING IT'S STILL LIVING? SERIOUSLY, DO YOU DO THAT WITH A BURGER OR A CHICKEN? I CAN STILL CLEARLY SEE AND NAME EACH BODY PART. I SWEAR, IF I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME OUT OF MY BODY-- EW, EW, MOM. I WAS GONNA SAY IF I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME OUT OF MY BODY, I WOULD SWEAR YOU WERE THE NEIGHBOR'S KID.

BASICALLY, WE'RE DECEIVING, CONNIVING LITTLE CREATURES. AND SOME DAY, WE'LL RULE THE WORLD. WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOALS. ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF YOU HAVE TO BE AT WORK IN SIX HOURS, WE BETTER GET MOVING. - WELL, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

NO, I NEVER DID. HEY, I HAVE A NEW LOONEY BIN. YOU WANT TO PLAY? I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY, BUT I WANT TO FINISH THIS MOVIE SO THAT I CAN GET BACK TO MY BOOK. - NERD. - SHUT UP, DAD. SERIOUSLY, I THINK I PREFERRED IT WHEN HE COULDN'T SPEAK. * THOSE WERE THE DAYS I CAN HEAR YOU GUYS. SO WHAT TIME YOU WANT ME TO WAKE YOU UP? UM, LIKE 3:00. THANK YOU, BABY. DINNER WAS REALLY GOOD. I KNOW. IT'S 'CAUSE I COOKED IT. UH-HUH. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS WEEKEND. TWO YEARS AGO, I GAVE UP ON EVER MEETING THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. AND AS SOON AS I STOPPED LOOKING, THERE YOU CAME AND SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET. AND YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE MY SOUL MATE. AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER THAN IF YOU'D BE MY WIFE. SOPH? SOPH? MARRY ME.
