Sleep well, little chicken legs Go! Was fate in your favour? And in vain... - And in vain... Everyone tried to... Die in you... the pride! Oh, wonderful! I can't believe what I'm seeing! I just can't! Is he always like this? - When he's been drinking. And you, Decia, you cruel, lovers' vampire, god, for too long... has left, at your whim... Power and injustice, finally the time has come. finally the time has come! It's two o'clock! It's two o'clock! It's true, it's two! Let's go, I don't want to be late for the countess. Let's go! Attention, we're sailing to the world, go! This is the first and the last time... The religious community is democratically organized. In our meetings everyone can word doubts, and even criticism, though it's hard to get to that point because our doctrine is thousands of years old How nice it is here. Come on, Mantrone, knock it off. - Don't bust my balls! Of course, the venues are very important in developing the doctrine and in building a relationship with the devotees. How did you manage to get into this cult? But it's not a cult, rather... it's a religion that anybody can embrace. So you too, if you want can become one of us. Well, living even if only for a matter of weeks, on the top of a mountain, wouldn't be very pleasant. Well, I figure, beyond the religious side, there should be other angles. Yes, the sexual one, for example. Yes, how about sex, with those people? I assure you, there is never... a dull moment. The fulfilment of the senses is however framed in a love ritual that makes the sexual act noble. In this ritual the excitement of the senses is brought out and the man and the woman get to the sexual act as in a trance. It's like... it's like the sublimation of the senses... exorcises love. Some kind of drug? A spiritual drug? Drug in the good sense of the word. I wish! If all our actions were inspired by a religious spirit, or, at least, by a sense of socializing. I'm sorry, Countess, it's the first time I've come here. But it looks like to me your speech is a bit too convoluted. And then you lose the meaning of things. I mean, preaching goodness... and not practicing it. If that's what you mean, I agree. There is something that is not caught... let's say, by protesters against a certain kind of society. High society. As you can see, I go straight to the point. But we've been long beyond what still interests the less endowed ones. Money, I mean. Do you have money? - Not much. We can talk, then. You're mad at rich people. Well, let's not exaggerate. You are. You don't want to judge us, keeping in mind what we give up, of our losses. A sincere friendship, for example. And this... is because of our wealth. Wealth is a nice word. When you don't have it. I wish I had it. Please forgive me. I'll be right back. Please, follow me. It's interesting to talk to someone that stands up to me. Usually they just agree. And this make me mad. Everything you see, is worth quite a bit. See, for example, with that painting you could buy at least ten of those motorcycles you youngsters like so much. Fuck! Short, but effective. Don't mind him, Countess, the boy is a bit of a foul mouth. It happens almost every night that someone ends up here. They know I like watching people making love. It's the price to pay to keep being part of my entourage. It means this room is always being used. And visited by me... like a sanctuary. Here is what wealth affords me, and it's a bit shabby. And you, who knows what you'd pay to be in my shoes. Are you friends? Yes. Wealth would kill your friendship. I don't think so. I like to play. Then again, anything can distract me... as long as it is different from the usual. Well. I own a villa nearby. It's been abandoned for years. It's too big. I felt alone in there. Go to my villa. I'll have some rooms furnished. And wait. I'll have an envelope delivered. Containing clues to find a treasure, hidden in the villa. Whoever finds it can keep it. Weird game. I want to prove to you that your friendship will end, as soon as money will be involved. Wealth, sweet wealth, evil wealth. Not bad this jalopy. I don't like its color. I'd like it red. Red? Please! Well? - That's bullshit. You're just the right guy for this car. Oh, sure I'm not as classy as you. What does a guy like him think? Pardon me, what do you think? About what? Well, for instance that you have to dress like a penguin. Well, it's my job. Being dressed like that must be a pain in the butt. It's a suit like every other. Listen, I'm a communist, and not a friend of the countess. If a revolution happens, you'll get the jalopy? No, it runs on too much gas. Here are the keys. I have to go. Leave them there, thanks. Goodbye. - If the revolution comes, I'll get the jalopy. Goodbye. Hey, guys, we'll not starve! There's every kind of food here! What about dinner? A light meal, appropriate for a gentleman like me. So, codfish! - Funny! Smoke? - No thank you. Want a GB? - Yes, a small one, please. How long do we have to wait for that letter? As long as it takes to really wish to open it. A storm is coming. Afraid? I was always afraid of it, since I was a baby. Forget the storm... We were talking about the letter. It'll come. Hopefully soon. - Don't be afraid, Mary. Rain never hurt anybody. - Thank you. Hunger made us forget the beds. Were do we sleep? - I took care of it. The bedrooms are ready. As many as we want. Then I'll go. You can take the bedroom upstairs. Mary, if you're afraid you can sleep with me. Goodnight. Are you leaving? No, just checking if it works. We can use it to go to town. To do what? - A trip, for instance. Nice park. What would you give to have a villa like this? I never thought of it. - Think of it. Is it important? - In a way, it would help me understand a lot of things. What now, are you a detective? Sometimes it's necessary, especially when you're forced to live the same adventure. What do you think about this? Is this a trap, this treasure? The countess doesn't look like someone that fools around with people. She has her goals. Expands her perverts' harem. You have to admit, the whole thing is weird. That's true. But such is the world today. What would you do with the loot, if you're the one who gets it? That depends on its worth. We could share it. We could. But as we speak you're thinking about swindling us. That's odd. - What? You said "us". You and Mary... are you a thing? Come on, don't be mad. Tomorrow I'll take you to the beach. Hi! Why did you leave me alone? Vegetable soup. Tasty and good for your skin. Ah, then I'll have some extra. My face is all pimply. I keep thinking about the countess. First of all, when will this fucking letter be here? Second, she asked if we were friends? Who said yes? We're not friends. We bluffed, after all. I said we were friends. I didn't think I was wrong. You could say we barely know each other. It would be smart to get to know each other a bit. And it would pass the time. Your mood has changed since this morning. What happened? Nothing. I was saying... Let's play some sort of truth or dare game. You know almost everything about me. I study when I feel like it, which is mostly never. I come from a middle class family. My father deals with pharmaceuticals. My mother never cheated on him, maybe just out of apathy. Mary is a normal woman, pretty. Ready to be sacrificed on the altar of the cock. Do you really think I'm a virgin? - Oh, that's your business. You're not an inveterate whore. Now tell us about you. I... I'm of the best age for everything. I like to do new things with new people. That's why I don't have a husband. So, according to what Simone says, I could be called an inveterate whore. But Simone is too stupid to understand things in their right perspective. I don't mean to offend. But he wanted to play a game, and sometimes you can't help saying unpleasant things. And now, goodbye. Bitch. Let's have a smoke, and... to hell with sadness! - No, thanks. I like to provoke her. That know-it-all demeanor of hers pisses me off. Silvia is a bit weird. Maybe she just thinks too much about that letter. She's nice to me. That's just convenience. - Don't talk crap. Rest will calm her down. It's unnerving to stay here just waiting... Delivery. A letter. - Thanks. Good day. It's here. - Finally. Of course, don't worry. We need to open it. We waited for so long. I say, let's enjoy this letter. - In what way? Let's go out in the park. It'll be nice to think that when we come back we'll know what's in it. I agree. Sleep well, little chicken legs Sleep well, little chicken legs. Sleep well, little chicken legs. What the fuck does that mean? Every time you don't know what to say, you start being gross. I'm sorry, "Countess". Let's not argue. We came to a conclusion. Now we need to decide if we are friends... or not. We're not friends. You said so. Stop being ironic. Mary... what do you think? We could share it. It would be easy, but your friend never stops changing his mind every chance he gets. Simone, what are you looking for. Me? Nothing, and I don't see why you get so mad. I get mad because of you're always trying to spread bad blood. Does me being unavailable make you mad? Just listen to me, you fucking "lady". I did nothing to piss you off. Probably because you have something to hide. You've been busting our balls since we got here. If there's something you don't like, just say it and knock it off. The countess was right. As soon as the letter arrived, we started fighting. Don't be mad. It'll pass. Now we must set some ground rules. Agreed? Let's hear them. First, we will all sleep in separate rooms, OK? Second, the one who gets the meaning of the phrase, and finds the treasure, will not leave the villa without warning the others. Why? - It's just civil. And that might just give you a chance to get the loot. That's what you called it. OK. Let's lose the second rule. Maybe there's no use for rules. Let's leave everything to chance. Sleep well, little chicken legs. Who are you? - My name is Andrea. I'm passing by, as usual. - As usual? I come here every year. I stay a few days to find herbs. To find herbs? You got a horse to feed? Look, horses don't eat herbs. I wander around the world looking for plants... used in some drugs. I get them for my brother-in-law. He has a pharmaceutical company. I thought only monks used herbs. You learn something every day. You want me to believe somebody pays you for herbs? I don't want you to believe anything. I told you the truth. And you come here every year. Sure. - And you stay here. Yes, a few days. It's nice here, the air is good. Do you know who owns this place? Yes, a countess, I think. But I don't give a crap. I bother no one, no one bothers me. You know something? When I came here I was surprised to find here all this furniture. I told myself: "Somebody came to live in this old shack." You can stay. You can sleep wherever you want. But, far from us. Don't worry. I won't bother you. See you in the morning. Where are you going? - Shopping. I hope you'll be back. If you're talking about the treasure, trust me, I haven't found it yet. Listen, Silvia, I've been meaning to talk to you, but things got in the way. Mary, for example. That too, but it's not the most important thing. It is to me. Anyway, we'll talk more about it later. I wanted to talk to you about the new guy. He's dangerous. I think he's connected to the treasure. Simone, I don't know what to say. Today is nice. I feel fine. The right sun. I want to get a lot of herbs. A nice full bag. This day... should never end. I want to fill my lungs with it. Here everything is so green, and smells nice, and friendly. I'd like to be a plant, and move with the wind. And get wet when it rains. And by night, accept the silence. Those guys at the villa... looked sad... worried. I need to talk to them. To see if they need someone to talk to. I need to talk to them. Here they are! How they sing! They're songbirds. When you hold them in your hand, they look like small cotton balls. Sorry, babies, very busy tonight. I'll abandon you. So long. Let's celebrate us being alone and wishing well. Who knows where Simone went? You just can't trust men. Come on, don't be afraid. We can sleep together. Who is it? - It's me, open up. I'm here, come. Hi! What's with you? You look like you've been bitten by a tarantula? A tarantula just got out. - You ass. I'm not an ass! I don't want you to see that old man anymore! Yeah, sure, I'll eat air. Soon I'll take care of you, but you won't meet that pig anymore. Did you win the lottery? You'll see. You'll have anything you want. You know that I don't see that old man out of love, like you say. And it's just once in a while. I don't want you to see him I won't see him anymore. Isn't what I give you enough? No. You must only be mine. My big pussycat. He wants me all for himself. He wants his little pussycat purr just for him. Poor old tomcat. You're so sweet. I heard you and Simone having sex. Why? You shouldn't have done it. Men are dirty. The storm is still distant. You look so upset. Nights have always scared me. When I asked you to sleep with me... I was the happiest one. During the night you got closer to me. I caressed your face... and you kept sleeping with your mouth part open just like a child. You're so sweet. Good morning! How are you? - Good morning! Fine. Well, I got curious. I don't understand why we're meeting. Yes, I see. I... asked to see you. - Alright. Let's stop here. It's the right place. See, I wanted to talk to you about something sensitive. It'll be no trouble for you, knowing the duchess, to find out something about that phrase in the letter. But...how could I do that? I've never been close to the countess. Too bad for you. You wouldn't be a driver by now. What do you mean? - Call me by name. OK, I will. - That's better. The countess is very vulnerable, if you know what you're doing. You'll just have to, like it was nothing, excite her twisted mind. You know what I mean? We could both use that treasure. How was your night? Fine, yours? - Can't complain. Where's Mary? Don't know. I saw her go out earlier. Where did she go? How should I know? Did she say anything? Not even hi. Why didn't you follow her? Because I don't give a crap what Mary does. Are you in cahoots with her? About what? We're here for a serious reason, and I'm under the impression that you two... Got it. Relax. Between me and Mary there's no pact. Here she is. Don't show we were talking about her. Hi! Anything to eat? It won't take a second. It's Russian herrings, you know? - Really good. It's a delicacy. Never had them. What are we doing today? Don't feel like staying inside. You're the one with the bright ideas. I am. I'll take you to a place you've never been before. You know we were born here. But you've never been to the place I'll show you. Is it far? - No, but it's abandoned. I always liked it there. I often came with my friends, when I was a boy. We played at pirates, or hide and seek. What should we go? We're grown ups now. Breathe some fresh air. Why was it abandoned? I don't know. The road doesn't pass by here anymore. Why doesn't it pass by here anymore. Hope there are no snakes here. - Thousands of them! Ah, you stupid! Come on, don't scare me. It's coming from Rome. I promised you a visit. How are things going? We live ecologically. That's something. Still friends? Just like before? I haven't been here in years. It was like seeing an old friend again. I spent most of my childhood here, in this villa. And it's not even a villa. It was built little by little. The central core created the other rooms, as in a chain reaction. It grew diabolically. I don't even know why. Some crazy ancestor of mine. I don't remember it so gloomy. Maybe my childhood must have been sad, as I don't love it. My father and my mother always ran away from here, as soon as they could. And I was always alone. I learned to love the silence and lack of wind. And rain. Loneliness as company. Some days I didn't talk for hours. I just heard the help chattering. They were the only ones that looked alive. The servants. Sometimes I walked in on them talking about me. About this weird child, quite scary. Like she was a ghost. Was I a ghost? It's possible. I liked to act. All the characters. By myself. I played the good guys, and the bad ones. And the bad ones always won. And then I ran away, on the terrace. And looked for god. I looked at the sea, the sky, the scudding clouds. I felt the wind, and asked myself if this was god. I never found an answer. My soul is here, and it's an evil soul. But it's not my fault. I looked for love. You will find the treasure, but it will seem useless after your first enthusiasm. Soon it will be evening again. The sea will turn black, and the wind will be more alive. And you, you will think about just one thing. The treasure. But not together. Each for themself. This much I know. Oh! Good! Good! What a surprise! How come you're here? I haven't seen you for a long while. Last time you called me by name. Well, you're a young lady now. Sit. She... has been my student, like you. It's been years. Hi. - Good day. You can go if you want. See you Wednesday. - Alright. Professor, don't stop for me. Finish your lesson, please. I can wait. - No, no, we were finished. Come. Goodbye. - Bye. Bye, dear. - Good day, professor. So, here we are, Silvia, Tell me. See? I called you by name. Ah, that's better. I feel younger. Wait a moment. I'll get a nice coffee. Don't bother for me. - No, no, no trouble at all. It's ready. It's nice to see you. I came to ask you something, Do you know the family crest of the De Angelis family? Ah, I see you remembered my old passion. There you go. Heraldry. The De Angelis family. A noble family. I should remember. I better check it. Let's see. So... De Angelis... Here we are. A maroon background with two ears of wheat. And a naked child with open arms. That's right. - See, professor, me and my friends, for some sort of a bet are living in an abandoned villa owned by the Countess De Angelis. Two days ago a weird guy came. He said he sells herbs, for a living. Ah, Andrea. Sure. Andrea Fani. How do you not know him? My friends don't know him either. Well, maybe he's not as famous as I thought. He's some kind of philosopher. He roams around, gets some herbs and sells them to his brother-in-law, who throws them away as they're useless. But it keeps him away and that's something. So he's a fool. - Let's say odd. He likes that life. No responsibilities. Living close to nature. He's a very sweet man. His brother-in-law must really love him, if he helps him like this. Silvia, the pharmaceutical company is owned by Andrea Fani. Hi. Where have you been? - Must I tell you my whereabouts? Yes, what were you two talking about. What do you want? What were you talking about. - It's our business. Leave me alone. Don't get cute with me! I know you agreed with Silvia to steal the treasure from me! And you're using the countess' driver! Leave me alone, you're hurting me! You won't take it from me! Where's Mary? Mary's gone. I found it. The treasure. First a toast. Look at this wealth. Did you really think I would share it with you? I could have never lifted that lid alone. I needed you. You have just a few moments of life left. The champagne you drank is poisoned. The treasure is mine. What are you doing? You won't have it! - No! Stop! You filthy whore! You bitch! You won't have it! I'll find someone to help me. And then I'll enjoy it all, because I'll kill him too. You're an ass, a criminal, even after you're dead! Countess? - Yes? Accountant Battista and antiquarian Mantrone want to speak with you. They say it's urgent. Send them in. - Alright. Madame la contesse! It's terrible! It's terrible! - Tell me. Speak. Countess, they found the bodies of those three that went to the villa for that bet. Mary dead in the woods, strangled. The other two crashed the car in a ditch. So, they lost their lives. See? Didn't I tell you? Would you like to have breakfast with me? As you wish. Thank you. I learned my rules from an old Irish uncle. Nice man. He used to say: "Beware of those close to you, keep them far away". This has nothing to do with what we were saying before. So you don't look persuaded by what happened. The death of those three? Well. We could do another test. For example, you too are friends. I've always seen you two together. The treasure is certainly still in the villa. It will be yours. If you can find it. Your friendship too... will end. Subtitles: nicolino, corvusalbus
