Seriously. - I'm home. - Noriko. What's going on? Oh boy, this room stinks. Hey, you bought that shirt? It's not like you at all. You look like a young thug. It's so flashy and shallow. - Aren't you the shallow one? - Why is that? Undressing like that in front of your brother. I was sweaty after walking all the way from the station. You're so disheveled. What shampoo are you using? Why did you come back? I left him. Your future husband? And what did he say? "If you were a man I'd punch you." Hey, you have a split hair. Look. Do you still love Mitamura? That's why you're here. How can you be so silly? 80 high and erect. - Tell me Tatsuo. -Hmm? We'll live together again. Thank you. Today, special price on imported beef. Seize the bargain. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - You finally had some? - Some what? Some of this. Hey, we're working. You take this job so seriously. You're a rare bird. Welcome. - Okuyama. - What? Today, special price on imported beef. Welcome. - Are you coming tonight? - I'll work late. I'll be waiting. I need your advice. See you. - Boss, a call for you. - Excuse me a minute. Yes, this is Mitamura. Sir... It's me, Noriko. It's you. See... I finally came back. Really? And you want to have sex with me? Sir... No. You're so great. You're the best in bed, sir. That man you were supposed to marry, how was he? We had sex twice. But he didn't measure up to you, sir. Oh, no. Are we doing it again? I haven't come yet. Sir. Welcome. See you next time. I arrived just now. I heard you knock. Sorry, I was very busy... Come in. - Sorry to intrude. - Welcome. I'll go buy cigarettes. She has a nice body, right? How would I know? Look at me, I'm not handsome, I'm not rich. So, I have to do her regularly. I do her in the morning, and again at night. And before we sleep I do her again. That's three times a day, every day. - Why did you call me? - Right. Listen... She just told me, she's pregnant. - She's pregnant? - Right. I'm back. Aren't we in a mess? Do you know a doctor who can do it? How much does it cost? Yasuo, you can ask at the hospital. I don't know about such things. You see Okuyama, this guy is just useless. I can't have a serious conversation with him. Sleeping like a baby. You're stealing again. So what? You have a shoplifting insurance. How dare you talk like that? You know I have to report you to the boss. I'm quitting that place anyway. And you should do the same since you're always complaining. What? Idiot! Don't worry, I'll talk to the boss for you. Don't get involved, he doesn't suspect you're in it too. So what's next? You need to provide for Naoko. We just broke up. What? After her abortion, I felt pretty awkward. Now I sleep here, in this joint, upstairs. Hey. How about a fuck tonight? You perv, with your dirty talk. Naoko was a good girl. Okuyama, you should go for Naoko. If you forget her face, her body is great. Let me call her now. Give me a break. - It's alright. - Fusudo. It's alright. It's me. I'm sending Okuyama to your place. Just let him fuck you. Idiot, don't make a fuss about one lousy fuck! Hey, good evening. You're so late. Keeping you waiting excites your desire even more. I heard you have a sister? Right. You know you can't touch your sister. Even if you are a boy and a girl living together... you can't keep wanting her. I never have such thoughts. Well, I'll believe you. The truth is... my brother raped me. It's called incest. I was 13. My brother was my first. Don't tell me such stories. He kept doing it for a year. The first time I thought it was a mistake. The second time I became his accomplice. - I'm going. - Okuyama. You don't want it? You came to do it, right? What? I'm not like that! I just want to forget him. Could we just do it? Naoko. Not like this. Please calm down. Tell me Okuyama, are you a virgin? Yep. It's alright. It's here. OK? Please go easy. Easy. You go faster little by little. That's right. You came? I'm sorry. It's OK. It was your first time. So I'll be your first, Okuyama. Let me wipe you off. We never did it like that. It's alright. Like this? Move your hips. But how? It's awkward. This time was great too. With you, it's getting better every time. It's so great. Nothing compares to this. You offer yourself to that man. Bye-bye. But your brother is not a virgin any more. Devices for Blowjob/ Handjob Simulation Look here. There are no tricks. Alright. One more. There, for you. How did you get it? It's a money printing machine. It's the real deal. Mitamura is paying you. He is? Right? Yes. I can't accept that money. You don't turn down something given with good intentions. I don't want you to see Mitamura. Never. You know that he is married with a kid. You know you'll be the one crying in the end. I have no intention to marry him anyway. So why are you seeing him? Because I like it. Isn't it enough for you to have me at home? What? Ever since you came back... we haven't had a chance to talk. We keep missing each other. Aren't you glad to live with me? What is that? Are you jealous of him? Idiot! You're so mean. Look, I win again. Are you going out? - Oops. - Careful, idiot! Welcome. There. You need to align here. May I help you? Yes. Okuyama. I was in the neighborhood. A,B,C,D,E,F,G... H,I,J,K,I,M,N,O,P... Q,R,S,T,U,V... W,X,Y and Z. What are you doing, Okuyama? You came here to do it, right? I didn't. You can't treat me as if I was your woman. I'll be independent now. I'm going earn downtown. Women always find money downtown. I'll work in a night club. If you want me, come to the club. You'll get a discount. It seems you finished your coffee. Alright. Okuyama. Do you have money? Nope. Well, a little. Give it to me. Hey that's... 20,000? Let's do it now. Hey... listen. Come on. Naoko. It's good. You're great. Yes, like that. Yes, faster. It's good. We're done. I'm officially a whore now. What is it? I thought I heard the phone. Mitamura isn't calling much lately. You've been home everyday. Are you expecting his call? I can't hear you. Noriko, I want to fuck you. Hey. How about you dress up. I earned more than expected, so I'll treat you. What, really? Yeah. It's quite easy for me to turn your life into hell... It's quite easy for me to give you a headache The moon was as bright as the sun when [met you... And you kept staring at me without a word Kitty, kitty, like a cute kitty, hop onto my lap You can sleep there all day Please, don't lie to me You look great in this dress. We did spend a lot. I know, thank you. You've become such a nice lady. I know I have... Bye-bye. Hey, the phone. Yes. It's you, sir. Yes, right away. Sorry, I have to go out. Please have dinner without me. Sorry. Let's have a look. Please, another beer. Just wait for me. Hey, Okuyama. I'm so glad you came. Oh no, I feel awkward. Because you know I'm looking. Come on, open your legs. But... It's beautiful! What a cute clitoris. It's pink and shining like a pearl. Really? Hey, you're all wet now. I'll be penetrating you now. Sir, I can't wait... Come. Come on, I like you very wet. I want you to be soaked. It's so big. Sir, you're so big. - It's the first time. - What? You never did that to me before, sir. I can't feel anything any more down there. You made me discover so many new pleasures. - How about me? - Huh? Do you have many pleasures to offer me? Of course. Hey? What? You have a white hair there! You're kidding. There, look. See, how about that? Not so surprising, you're twice my age. You turned 40 this year. And look, you're growing a little pot-belly. Too late to hide it now. I'll see if I find more. Oh, come on, sir... Have you lost your vigor? - I'm going. - Hey, sir. You know good restaurants. Because I'm from a higher class. Sorry, I'm poor. Tell me your story. Right. Well, it's about Mr. Mitamura... He's a bit weird sometimes. Not only sometimes. He doesn't drink from my glass any more. Now he calls me 'Miss Okuyama'. What's that? It's getting awkward. It's for the best. Just dump him already. Isn't it delicious? I can't have a serious conversation with you. How can you be in love with that dude? He's so full of himself. He's just a dirty old dude keeping a mistress. I'm not ashamed of anything. He lost both his parents at 12. Just like us. Isn't it great that he succeeded on his own? I can't be blamed for loving such a great guy. Noriko. Enough. Look at you, you don't love anyone. You can't know my feelings. But I do love someone. Because of her, I often can't sleep at night. I miss her so much sometimes, I could cry. Come on. You think only you can feel? You don't know how worried I am about you. Hey. What a surprise, Miss Okuyama. Hello. See you. Please. You know her? She's a former employee. Please, enjoy. To you. Cheers. Say... we should have sex today. Sir, you're so straightforward. You don't want to? But you are seeing someone, sir? Well. I'm about to break up with her. Why? In this world, all my love... goes to my wife and kid. When I have sex with another woman... it is just a sort of hobby. I like your candor. She doesn't understand that. When we men mature... we carefully calculate each of our steps. And my next step is to break up with her. But we are here to have a good time. Well, then, shall we have sex? Well... I'm good in bed. Really? Don't! Come here. Come on now. Leave me alone. Enough. A,B,C,D, he dumped me... We're finally home, Noriko. E,F,G,H, I waited... But I will always... Until I die... J,K,L,M,N... Here. Nope. Come on, put on your nightgown. You'll catch a cold. Brother... Wear this T-shirt. Sleep with me. I can't sleep alone. Hey! I feel so lonely tonight. Brother, you're the only person I love. Noriko. Brother. You'll forget that man. Yes. You're OK with this? I'm going to make love to you. Brother. It's OK, right? Noriko. Hello. Okuyama. Naoko? I'm suffering. I have a fever, please come. You're calling me for that? Please, I'm so lonely. I have no one else to call. I can't come today. I'm sorry, I feel so weak. I'll wipe off your sweat. Okuyama, don't... Don't... Don't... Don't... Okuyama, it hurts. I shouldn't have. Naoko, do you have any medicine? I don't. I'll cook something. You should eat. I don't want to eat. Okuyama. Thank you for coming. It's OK. You see, I have no one. I could die and rot here. No one would notice for weeks. Naoko. You should quit the night club. Yes. Alright. Yes, always so erect. Welcome. Welcome. What? Noriko. I thought I could cook dinner for you. - I'm shopping. - You feel better? In the name of Justice, fight all evil. What? I'll destroy the villains with my laser beam. Hey. I wasn't sick in the first place. Sure, I'll keep a scar for the rest of my life. You had it coming. I was stupid. Are you moving on? - Right. - Just move on. Yes, I'll forget him. Good... I'm off in 30 minutes. Just wait for me. Sure. I need to see someone on the way back. - What? - I'll introduce her to you. Girlfriend? The better my life gets, the better you'll be too. How do you dare be happy when I'm sad? Where? It's here. Naoko. Well, that's... Thank you for helping my sister. I'm Naoko's brother. Well... Well... I brought you healthy food. There. Is she the girl you wanted to introduce to me? Don't be silly, not a broad like that. But you're OK. You would never do drugs. You don't remember last night? What about last night? What? Did I do something last night? Better forget it. Come on. Tell me we didn't do it. Of course not. I would die if we did. I'm telling you we didn't! I'm relieved. It's true that you and me, we're playing with fire. It's been just you and me since we were kids. It's often tricky. We have to be careful. We're both at a difficult time of our lives. I'm going. Let's go. You're the most handsome man in Tokyo... I'm so glad you came tonight to comfort me The sounds of the city enter through my open window I close my eyes and think you're an angel Tonight we see a half-full moon I'm trembling in your arms... Let's do it again, just like last night I'm all soft in your arms My eyes are blinking with the stars You look so much like an angel, so much like an angel... Noriko! THE END
