Jayan’s Quarry licence expires today! Well Pappa! Isn’t Jayan aware of me taking charge? Won’t the work be stopped then? Serve a glass of juice to Sir. Are you trying to call Jayan? Then tell him, S.I Moopan is back after having a good visit, As Kadagasherry S.I!! If he is Manly, ask him to smuggle a load of sand via my station! As you say, Ganeshan is not new to smuggling sand! Please don’t exaggerate this case We want the Ganeshan as well as the Truck back Let’s see! Moopan has just taken charge! That’s why he is too annoyed -We’ll sort it out. - Give the phone to me My many trucks are lying rusted in many Police stations! That’s not an issue for me. All those were given as compliments to Police officers! But this Truck, Even if it lies atleast for a day infront of Moopan’s station, Then, that’s my defeat! That should never happen Cut the phone! I know what to do. You ask him to come Come in! Bro! You got to carry a load tomorrow night! Not free of cost If you reach the load at the said destination, I will offer you that Truck! What do you say? Pappaettan! How much will this cost now? A second hand one! Nearly 8-8.5 lacs Vijayan, come here!

I am holding this Steering for 12 yrs He knows my financial condition better Ha ha, Flat tyre…! However it was good that you lost job in the Driving school That time I was a bit disappointed. Now I feel big trucks are far better to drive than small Cars! Listen! I am not driving a big truck.. It’s a Small one No matter big or small, isn’t it a truck? I will borrow loan from Kudumbasree (Women Organisation) We’ll withdraw the Chit fund amount Why can’t we buy a truck? We’ll buy it later First serve me some more curry! Very tasty! Buying truck borrowing loan from kudumbasree!! Why we needlessly involve in the fracas of Policeman and Jayan! We?

That scoundrel beat you black and blue, is it? Either he must pack his box and get away, Or he should be into the box forever! Either way, let that not be carried in your account! Hello.. There is a chance of Police chasing you -Change your route -Okay dude Nope! Oh Sir! Sir! Sir! It was needless to rush, wasn’t it, Sir? Sir, he is trying to flee! Go and check You! Sir, it’s our S.I Stop..Stop..Sir.. Where the hell were you? What is this.. blood?! Where is the Truck? I will tell you, let’s move. - Tell me the matter. - I will tell you, you move.

What is happened has happened! Now tell me advocate, what should I do now? Don’t release those two trucks! Particularly the truck that hit Moopan!

Laying hands on me without dispatching the load!! Jaya..No.. This Chandu knows how to dispatch the load Amid it’s you who played the lousy tricks.. Who sent Ganeshan after me? He would’nt have come to the spot without your knowledge If he hadn’t played his lousy tricks, truck would’ve reached its destination! Take him away! Leave...leave.. Leave, Leave I say Father..

As it was seized by the Police, I just wrote it off! What is the use of analyzing dead one’s horoscope?! You don’t worry, ji! I will definitely get you a lead Well Ji! You’ve been to my house for the first time and leaving without having anything? According to me Gold and Time are one and the same I don’t wish to lose! hey.. If such a bigwig comes in search of me, that means the lost good is not a trivial one! How much price does the truck they sold would fetch? - Maximum 3 -3.5 lacs - Okay How much cash did they give? Eight lakhs! How did they arrange the rest? Do one thing then Bring those guys secretly to me! Do we need to take risk? So you started realizing things! Come Pappa! The protest movement needs permission I can’t tell you to carry on with the protest Because I’m a Police officer And Law has its own rules We’ve also moved as per law That’s why we received the Stay order! Jayan’s men are inside this Station And you are also aware of that Yes. Sir... Okay, you leave, I will see to it. - Thank you - Okay Okay Sir, I wished to come and see you in the hospital By then, I got a suspension and was busy with that! Why did you call me, Sir? I have just one thing to tell you This sailing on two boats must be stopped at once! Why do you talk like that, Sir? It’s the Government who pays your Salary, and not Sand Jayan! Listen! I want the stolen truck and the trucker that hit me right here! - That…Sir, I.. - Stop it. To change your suspension to dismissal is not a big thing for me! I won’t do such a thing Because I want you right here At this Station limits! Let me see if I can mend you! Moopan must have got some leads That’s why he is in such a speed! Shucks! I didn’t get time to act also You lost your Cap and Lathi also! Being in Suspension, what the hell can you do? Though in Suspension, a Police is a Police! As if! Sir, Please take a gulp What to do? Definitely he will find out who stole the truck from the Station. And if he catches him, That boy will blurt out everything! That is for sure So better find out where that guy is! That’ll be good! Not this… I will get you another one Keep quiet bro! You tell the same whenever you see me! Don’t say like that, my pearl. In my mobile also, a few matters are there! Please don’t fix me! So you’ve fear, right? If Laila comes to know I stayed in such a lousy place, my life will be at stake! I don’t think we’ll be chased anymore! For, they should’ve done that long ago! If we keep staying away for a long time, People may doubt It was you who suggested this idea! So what if I said? Shouldn’t there be an end to it! It’s like being in a prison… I’m going. Sadam.. On one side Police… the other - Contessa! Contessa! Bullshit! Isn’t that safe over there? We can take it whenever we want! Dude! Things are not as we imagine Who created a brawl in Madi Jewellery the other day? Didn’t a bike hit us, Who rode that bike? Wasn’t it you who told me they went away by bike? Then, where are they? If that bag belongs to them, won’t they come looking for us? But they are not aware that bag is with us! No..that Truck.. Then Jayan.. If they want, they can easily trace us! O my Chandu! Don’t get tensed unnecessarily! No kick even after a drink is my plight now! And besides, this lousy set up, to distract concentration! - Dude! - Sir, Like to have any touching? Pickle, Snacks..Whatever you like Shut up and get away! Hell with him! What sort of people are they! Shucks! Keep at least the door open.. Let the ventilation come Okay no need It’s a complete playground If all the Players get in you know what’ll happen! If it’s that rascal… Definitely I’ll smash his face! Pappaettan! You! Here? Do you fear? Is there ...? You carry gold, don’t you? That too Contessa! They will come! Sure to come at any cost! They have no other option Here they come! Come, come! Didn’t I say, Jaya? Hope you don’t carry any old grudges! I’ve already forgotten it You gave the Cash, didn’t you? Then what? Why is he like this? Come guys! I came to know the happenings. Careful! Be very careful Don’t worry! Till I’m beside you, no one can dare touch you Come. The person whom we’re going to meet now is, a close friend of mine! Hi Jayan Bhai! He will help you to sell your gold Nothing to fear! You can trust him Once everything is done, please don’t forget this Jayanettan! Deal! As said and done! Come..20..20 Rs ..70..70..70... Hey.. Hey.. This thrashing is not to make you tell the truth! Do you think yourself to be God of death to run over me by truck? Hey..Hey.. Attempting to kill a Police officer on duty, You rascal! I know how to put you behind bars for life time. Right now I can present you before the Magistrate But I won’t do that Because I will lose my chance You rascal! I know on whose behest you did it! It’s not yet time to deal with him. But that will happen soon! Bloody Sand Jayan! Moopan will present Ganeshan before the Judge right today Remand is for sure If Court permits, Moopan will get him for interrogation If they find the trucker also, Then Police van will reach your house looking for you! It may happen a little earlier also! Well! I scoot away from your case It’s a matter of my life, Jayan! Ungrateful swine! I’m not sure that he is grateful or not! But he talks perfect law I’ve something more to tell! You please stay away for sometime Attempting to kill a Sub-inspector on duty is the Case! This is my advice! Later don’t say I didn’t. Pappan! Remove the vehicle from there today itself! If Police.. Don’t worry about Police and Moopan Until the gold reaches my hand, It’s wise that I don’t get caught by Moopan It’s a waste of time! That’s why… For the time being, I will stay away And later attend to the Case etc! I don’t understand what you say or do! Listening to your words, I dismantled the truck You order me to do this and that and I do.. At least now say, where are we heading to? No change in what I say and do We will leave tonight, Sadam Where? Do I need to dance in tune with your decision? I have a couple of tasks to do Immediately after I return, we will leave. Got it? Where are you going with baggage? I need to travel, mom I.. ..will return only after some days I’m confident that you won’t engage in any wrong doing That won’t work, Raja I told Pappan that day itself, to find that guy and finish him That is the only solution As you know, if Moopan catches him.. Okay.. Cut the phone, I will call you later Oh no! You! You said you’re checking out, but you seem to have visitors. Anything benefiting us, sir? Visitors? What happened? Where is my bag? Where is it? Where is my bag, you dog? Thought you can easily ditch me! Sadam! Come. Oh God! Hey..Hey..Open it man Won’t it be enough if I wash my hands once? It’s enough if both of you speak, where my Possession is? Take him... One witnessing a murder will only feel to speak the truth! Till now, my judgement in that aspect has not gone wrong Therefore I trust your words So my Possession is with Jayan, isn’t it? So let’s together go to where Jayan is before he flees! Move Come dude! Please sir, Jayan is not at home Only two ladies are there Get away, Sir, Please listen Jayan is not here, sir I don’t think I have seen you when I’d come here earlier Were you not here?

Before anyone could notice us, we can see them. Dude! My family… My mom…must be in tension now. Let’s for god’s sake end this up, Chandu! I’m tired, running in fear like a thief! Chandu! Let me tell you one thing. You are playing staking both our lives! We can take that from there and return it, Chandu That’s not possible, dude! Would you stop only after staking my life?

We must get out of this mess at any cost For that, we need his help once more He doesn’t know me That Truck is for us If I give up that Truck then loss is for us And not for him Jayan is a scoundrel! I stood beside all his dirty activities. When you had courage to face such a wicked person, Shouldn’t I also show a little courage? What you said was right This is not Jayan’s truck anymore It’s your’s! Jayan only knows to make. Never gives others! Now Jayan’s enemy is neither Adiga nor Moopan Its YOU!
