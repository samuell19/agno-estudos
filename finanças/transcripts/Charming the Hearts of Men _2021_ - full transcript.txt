Welcome home. Few men have had both the courage and compassion possessed by our dear judge. Let us show the compassion that he showed others by following the words of our dear Lord from Matthew chapter 5. "You have heard it said that you should love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say unto you, 'Love your enemy.'" They're crowding in. I need a drink, Abel. It's early. Mm, mm, mm. That was a beautiful service, right? Yeah, Daddy would be proud. Oh, don't give me that look. Even God can see the necessity of getting drunk on a day like today. Thank you, Walter. Good luck. Baby, there's a whole lot of folks out there that want to pay their respects. Okay. Right. Let's get this over with. And her second husband was a polo player. Doesn't it sound glamorous? Sounds to me like she can't keep a man. - Divorced. - Twice. - Are you busy later? - And the other one, well they say he wasn't much more than a playboy himself. Who would play around on her? Oh, my God, you act as though you know her. You know she wouldn't give you the time of day. What do you know about fitting in? All the important men were at the meatballs and you were at the dip. - It's all BS. - It's communist talk. - Damn right. - Them Yankees and unions. - Down here causing problems. - Mhm. - Drink, sir? - Thank you. Obliged. - Thank you. - Very much. And it's that King and his boys. They're gonna send us all to hell in a handbasket with the Civil Rights Bill. You gotta stop this nonsense. Now, hold on. We are nowhere near hell in a handbasket. We are here to pay respects to a good man, one of the best. Judge, your wisdom will sorely be missed. - Safe landing. - Here, here. Here, here. Smells like they put out the meatballs. Come on, boys, you can't miss this. Oh, my. Don't be shy, boys, you better dig in 'cause these puppies are gonna go quick. Now, they got these little toothpicks here, but I'm gonna grab one of those plates. So sorry for your loss. Oh, thank you, thank you so much. - Thank you for coming. - Mhm. Maybe she'll come home to run this place. That is not going to happen. - Thank you so much. - I'm so sorry. - I know, it's so sad. - Grace. Excuse me. I don't know how she does it, but Mattie's cooking just gets better and better. Hi. Thank you for coming. - I'm gonna miss your father. - Me too. Man, you are more beautiful each time I see you. Mm. And you are always a charming politician. Your father kept me up on all your escapades. "Escapades," hm. Well, I hope they weren't too boring. On the contrary, I was living vicariously. Congressman, Sophia Spencer needs to see you in the other room. Excuse me, my fan club awaits. - Call me if you need me. - I will. Con... Miss... Mrs. Gordon? - Yes? - I'm... I'm Bradford Lotts. I'll be the one at the bank to handle your father's affairs. Clear... clear things up. - We will need to talk. - Oh no, that's, um, fine. Just leave things as they are. - Well... - And have you tried that dip? It's delicious. Excuse me. Snotty bitch. What did she say? Useless female, that's what she is. Will you excuse me? Come on, Walter, we're on the move. I'll catch you later. - You ain't get me nothing? - You know I did. I wanna see this here. - No meatballs? - You ingrate. I couldn't bring you meatballs, the red barbecue sauce would stain my pocket. Best kitchen in 20 miles... let's get rolling before another constituent feels the need to chew my ass. All right, Walter. All right now. I look terrible in black. I mean, why wear black to funerals? Why not red to celebrate? Daddy's life should be celebrated. Sure should, baby, sure should. Now, get on out of this dress. You know what I heard them say? Narrow-minded little ninnies. - What'd they say? - They said that I was a spoiled, middle-aged divorc√©e, and good for nothing. Ugh, oh, and useless. - That's what they said. - Don't you mind what they sayin', 'cause you know who you are. No, maybe I don't. I know I've been... a good man's daughter, and two not-so-good men's wife, but... I mean, otherwise, am I useless? No, baby, don't fix your mind thinking that. Our God has a plan. I wish I had your faith, Mattie. Well, it don't matter if you do or you don't, He's still looking out for you. Ugh. - Thank you. - You're welcome, precious. - Ooh, here we go. - Where? Mm, mm, mm. - First, if you don't mind. - Good morning. Hello. - Uh, Dad, the... - Well, who are they... and what can they be talking about? New York? Dick, come look. I'm watching The Secret Storm. Those TV airwaves are gonna scramble your brain. Ugh, who cares? Gonna go around with a scrambled brain? Well, sounds pretty good to me. And that's on your account. It's on account of a man like you took an interest in me, and I wanna say thanks. Well, I'm glad things are going well, Kate. Well, they seem to be, I report for modeling assignments tomorrow. Ma'am, your meter has expired, and the new meter maid is unforgiving. Thank you. Have a good day. Yes, ma'am, may I help you? I need to have a few words with someone about my accounts. - Mr. Lotts. - Mr. Lotts, yes. Can you tell him that I'm waiting? Yes, ma'am, have a seat, we'll be with you in a moment. I'm finished with this one, if you want it. It's mostly about Liz Taylor and her affair with that Welshman. Even a big movie star has trouble with her men. Well, I guess you get what you settle for. Yes, ma'am, I guess you do. Well, if we're gonna talk about men, I should introduce myself. - Grace Gordon. - I'm Ruth, and this is my girl, Angelina. Well, that's a very pretty dress, Angelina. - Thanks. - So fancy. God! I told you not to bother me this morning, I am busy. Well, the office is filling up. One woman looks like a real tart, and she's got a child with her. The way that child is clutching a paper sack, I think it's full of money. And Mrs. Gordon is here. Oh! So, today is not going to be a complete bore. She said she's here to give you a few words. Oh, she is, is she? Well, I have a few words for her as well. In, um... in 10 minutes, I want you to come interrupt us. And is your dolly a good girl? - Mhm. - Um, uh, Mrs. Gordon. - Please, please, come in. - Well, these ladies - were before me. - I... I insist, please. That's all right, ma'am, we'll just sit here in the cool air. - Sure? - Yeah. - It was very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. What are you doing here? I wanna put my money in a safe place, and the paper says you're giving out toasters - to new depositors. - The bank doesn't take your kind of money. My money's green, like everyone else's, and I earned it, the hard way, and who knows it better than you? Come on, let's go. Please, have a... seat. Um, you know, I... I have called. I've, uh... I've left several messages with... Yes, it seems like there's been a breakdown, and had it not been for a stack of Mattie's famous sweet potato pancakes, our water would've been turned off. Well, uh, Mrs. Gordon, let's, uh... let's best see how to describe this breakdown. The bank pays bills with money from a customer's account... Yes, I know that. I have to go to lunch, so if you could just deal with these quickly, and move them forward. We don't really like disturbances. No, no, most... most people do not like disturbances, but, uh, you've got one now. You see, there is no money in the account. I don't understand, where was the money put? Well, your father transferred a great deal of what he had to you over the years, and sold off land along the way to, uh, keep you up in your adventures, oh, and... and marriages. Been two, right? So, the account is dry as a bone. Now, the house and what land is left are yours, but, uh, the mortgage is overdue, and you'll have to sell. Sell? That house has been in our family for generations. Times change, and besides, farmland really isn't worth much these days. Mattie and Abel, they've been on that land all their lives. Mattie's granddaughter's with us, and she has no place to go. I have no place to go. No, I wouldn't dream of selling. Well, unless you've been stashing money away somewhere. But, look, once you've paid off your debts, I mean, if you don't live too long, you'll make do. Merner Courts would be your best bet in town. Merner Courts? That's a retirement home. Mr. Lotts, you have a call, someone important I think. Well, you've gotta do something, extend the loan. Well, the, uh... the bank only makes loans to men, and anyway, I really don't think you'd be a good bet. I mean, you're 40, am I right? That is none of your business. Okay, well, near enough. Uh, no skills, no money, no man. I, uh... I think at this point in you life, missy, you need to face facts: You are retired. How dare you? What's the matter, baby? We're broke. Tightening-our-belts broke, or fending-off-the-wolves broke? - Wolves. - Mm, mm, mm. And that scrawny little banker, he said there's nothing I can do about it, so there it is again, I'm... I'm useless. Now, you know you ain't useless. Well, what can she do? Well, just get another one. - Another what? - Man! I don't want another one! That's our only option. Well, what about the Congressman? Now, that is a good man, and, baby, you remember you was flirtin' with him when you was too young to be flirtin'. And he got that government money. That kind don't ever run out. Ugh, yeah, and he's a confirmed bachelor. Oh, God, I'll have to brush upon my skills. Jubilee, go get the judge's address book. So, you're what, you're gonna choose one from a book? No, too old. - Or dead. - Uh-uh. He spits when he speaks. - Mr. Parker, no. - No. We both agree that 14,000 miles of interstate highway is an incredible feat. But, with more funds, we could be one nation under God, connected by asphalt. Yeah, well before you go patting yourself on the back just yet, the Romans built 50,000 miles of road from sea to shining sea in 300 BC without a single bulldozer. - Really? - And no constituents calling to complain about the cost, or the dust, or the offensive billboards blocking their view of their lovely hills. Emanuel Celler, again, and Alice Paul asking when you might be available to talk. I know, the bill. Damn it, no rest for the weary. Thank you, Rachel. Listen, you want my support for more funding - for this asphalt river? - I do. No more graft. Clean this thing up, and give me more exits. And more fund... Tell the two of 'em I'll get back to 'em just as soon as I'm able. You are a glutton for punishment. I believe the word is "masochist." Here you go, here's your dress and drink. I made it strong just the way you like. - Thank you. - Mhm. - Mm. - Do you still remember what to do on a date? Yeah, it's like riding a bike, and men are only interested in one thing. Mm, snatch. No, I was referring to their deeper need. - And what's that? - Well, to talk about themselves, or just a sympathetic ear. I'm not about to be a sympathetic ear - for no man. - Oh, really? So, what are you gonna do, you gonna make it on your own, - Miss Independent? - Yes. There I was, thinking you're a realist. Here. Why don't you try some, try these on. Let me see you walk. - Where am I gonna wear these? - I don't know, when you go hootin' and hollerin'. - Oh no, I am not my mama. - No, you got more sense. But you gotta go wild sometime, you know, dance with abandon. That's how you dance, with abandon? Mm-mm. I'm not allowed to be that free. You know, my first drink that was at the Blue Goose, Abel waved me in. I learned two things that summer: How to hold my liquor, and how to dance like no one was watching. Oh, what a good time that was. Oh, I felt so free. "But now, I cannot dance upon my toes. No man has instructed me." That's Emily Dickinson. Who's she? Just another woman who had to dance backwards. Right, I'm about to sell myself like a pound of meat. Hm? Yeah, I think I can sell myself as prime. Spode, it's my favorite pattern. A man with taste, now that's a great trait to have. I developed it on my Italian travels. My mother lets me out of her grip every summer. I go to Rome for a month of utter bliss. Rome in the summer, that's so romantic. Oh, I'm free to wander the cafes and shops, meet all varieties of interesting people. Now, a good boy never kisses and tells, but, oh, some of the things I have done. But, mother's tight purse strings pull me right back every time. She's never found a vice she could embrace. The old penny pincher'll probably have a grip on me my entire life. Uh, would you excuse me a moment? Oh, Mattie, wrap it up, one for him, and one for his mama. And... get the address book. All right, baby. They don't want us around here, they keep doing their thing. So, y'all need to get yourselves in the system and be registered so y'all can vote. Listen to me. I'm right. I'm here for you. Jim Crow's biting me, and he's biting you. Now, we should all be equal under the law. Come on, y'all. This high-yellow fella come down from the North to help us poor darkies out. I've come down to get you here to enlist you in the battle of your equal rights. Equal rights? Abel, what you think about this whole communist talk - he talkin' about? - Just trying to figure out - what it all means. - Yeah. Well, what it means, Abel, is, uh, old Peanut here, he gonna get half of what's yours, split down the middle, share equal. Nah, nah, nah, that's not what I mean. Yeah, Abel, give me half your bill. He ain't got shit. - Lazy ass. - Yeah, that's what it is, man. Well, he gonna take half of it. Not what I'm saying. See, old whitey here? He fought the whole fuckin' world in World War II defending this republic. - Yeah, he did. - Old whitey's doing a good job - running things. - Uh-huh. Streets are safe. - You got good-paying jobs. - Mhm. And you men sleep with your windows open. Now, what other animal lives under that kind of protection, - huh? - I know who you are. You drive the Congressman, and you'd like things to stay exactly the way they are unless that man tells you otherwise. Listen here, yellow boy, I don't kiss no one's ass, I'm my own man. - That's right. - The way I sees it, all the men here, we're doing pretty goddamn fine. Yeah, you see, old whitey, he got a plan. He building a highway from the sea to shining sea. That shit's so big they're gonna call it - a superhighway. - Are you content? Are you content to pee by the side of that road? Sleep and eat where that white man says your ass can? Jim Crow's gotta go. Y'all gotta register yourselves - and stand up. - You're just itching to get your hand on that power stick, and you ain't got no plan, yellow boy. You ain't got no plan. Mhm. Call me "yellow boy" one more time... - And what? - Hey! Hey, y'all gonna spend all night fighting over about what? 'Cause the only thing gonna get settled tonight is who's gonna get hot and sweaty, right? You. - You wanna dance? - With all that white blood in him? He ain't gonna be able to move much, baby. Well, you do gotta dance in our shoes if you trying to... trying to preach to us. Come on now, I'll give you a dance. Hey, Abel, you got some of that, uh... that good whiskey locked away? - Sure do. - All right now. Break out something for the boys. - On me. - Two, come on, man, for me? - The lady, too. - That's what I'm talkin' about. Now, y'all can't run from the truth. You cannot run from the truth. - Okay. - Jim Crow is alive and well. Please, please, register yourself... - Okay. - ...so you have equal rights. I hear you, man. Lord, Lord, Lord. You'll be all right, you gonna be all right. You gonna be all right. Johnnie, Johnnie on the rocks. Ooh! You got back so soon. Yeah. That juke joint, like the one my mama couldn't get enough of. Women throwing themselves at men, hoping for something they ain't gonna get. Men arguing about what they want and don't have. Mhm. Where do I fit in? Look up at that sky. Each one of them stars shining from its own spot. He got a plan for us all. - Come on, now. - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! - Mommy! - Wow, are you feeding them kids good? Hm? - The scrawny little mutts. - I put food on the table - the best I can. - Mhm. You think those men who gave me them children sending me money? I ain't got no steady work. What you got for me? Or am I just along for the ride? Walter. That boy last night. He said he's gonna make us equal. Not you, baby. He wasn't talkin' about you. Hi, Andy. Hey, how are ya? Now, let's get this straight. There's a few more things to take care of. So, all right, have him looking sharp. Nothing sells better than a well-dressed underdog. Trying to win a Pulitzer Prize, aren't you? Camera ready, and no trouble. Don't you worry about that, I'll have him singing Dixie and huggin' their mama, if it gets us the front page. In Birmingham today, police arrested Martin Luther King, along with 58 other members of the Southern... Every time you turn around something about some darkie causing trouble. NAACP. SNCC. Call themselves T-R-O-U-B-L-E, make it clear. That is the same car. I'm tellin' ya, something is getting ready to go down. George, ain't nothing going down around here except your IQ. Oh, look at you, getting into the Cutty Sark already and The Secret Storm, haven't even started yet. Now, tell me about this fascinating job you have. Ford automobile's a good value. Ford don't make anything cheap. Top of the line, a Thunderbird V8. Well, that one's been a big best seller for me this year. Can I get a top-off in here? Well, let's get to it. As a rich widow in town, I know what this all about. This place is expensive to keep up. Needs work. You need money. Of course, my dealership prints it, long as Ford makes cars like the Ford Galaxy. Nothing cheap there. It's got a 390-cubic-inch engine. When that thing roars up, it's like... Oh, my Lord, come on. Come on now, spit it out, spit it out. Oh, Lord. Um, no dessert. It says, um, that you buy things that are useful and good. - That's right, I do. - Well. Well. Say, uh, what does this little one do? That's a pickle fork. It's 1800s, my great-grandmother's. Huh! Teresa, take a look at this. It's a fork just for a pickle. Oh, my goodness, a pickle fork. - Huh. - And many a fine dinner it has seen, I'm sure. Unfortunately, fine dining items just don't sell anymore. It's all been replaced with the TV dinner. Before you know it, we won't even be talking to each other. We'll just be lost in our appliances. Amen. I hope it doesn't come to that. Gotta go, it's good to meet you, ma'am. Good to meet you, too. - Bye, y'all. - All right. Bye. Ma'am... I do give cash for diamonds. The only thing that good-for-nothing paid for. That's beautiful, let's have a look. Ah, yeah. Well, there is a pretty significant flaw. How much? Are you talking to 'em, Walter? You tellin' 'em all that pie-in-the-sky, everybody's-equal poppycrap is just that? And things are nice as they are. I'm talkin' to 'em, boss, but everybody don't listen to me, you know? They say there's always two sides. Not always two right sides. Look out there. God did bless America. He really did. How do I look? Hm. Hm, what? A man ain't gonna buy the cow when he can drink the milk - for free. - I'm just letting him know that the cow's still worth milkin'. Just... Mm, mm, mm. Now. Mm, could do with a little bit more punch. Well, bit of valerian, little pinch of passionflower. I got it set, right? Before we use any more of what we got left, we better make sure this is what we want. Well, Lord, more spice ain't gonna do no harm. It looks like we the only ones at this dinner party. You come get me out, you hear me making promises I can't keep. - Oh, I know the drill. - How do I look? Like a man with no self control. Ladies, ladies, what is that smell? Ooh, we're cooking all kinds of wonderful things for you, - Congressman. - Don't be wasting your fine herbs on me. I'm already under your spell. How is she, Mattie? - Has it been rough? - She gettin' right along. Mhm. Oh, your magic herbs give you an unfair advantage. Well, if I'd known you were gonna be this easy, I wouldn't have opened Abel's home brew. I am this easy, so be gentle. Look at you, beautiful as always. Such a flatterer, and it isn't even voting time. That's how you know I mean it. - How have you been? - Oh, I don't even wanna think about that, but you are the escape. The delicious escape. Well, let's, uh, go outside, and pour ourselves a drink, and let's talk about nothing important - all night long. - Yes, ma'am. Jubilee, you take good care of Walter tonight. Why I gotta take care of him? Because I said so. Thank you kindly, ma'am. Yes, sir. Why don't you sit down and have you something to eat? How y'all doin', Miss Mattie, with no man in the house? Uh, we doin' all right. How y'all doin' up there in Washington? Well, a lot of talking, but mostly same old grumbling. Now, who this here, Miss Mattie? You know her, that's my grandbaby, Miss Jubilee Moody. Well, your grandbaby sure grown up fast. I'm not the one up for sale. You sure? She's spicy, I like that. Mhm. God damn, it tastes so good. Oh, even the air out here smells sweet. To you, Grace. To this place. To this night. To us. Mm. Mm, my mama used to make muscadine wine. And me, an official of the law. Well, you aren't gonna turn me in, are you, - Congressman? - No, ma'am. Uh, you mind if I just help myself? Muscadine wine. That's America's grape, and you know, every great civilization needs its own wine. Miss Mattie, I'm proud how you're teaching your grandbaby how to treat a man. Woo! She got some work to do, though, huh? Quit studying me. Ah, you don't want me to study, huh? Tell me, what you want old Walter to do? Nothing, you only here 'cause you driving the man. Ouch, come on, girl. He's eating out of her hand. I mean, he is actually eating right out of her hand. I bet he was droolin' when he saw this fruit tart. Big old smile on his face. Big old stupid grin. Now, this here is near the best I ever had. Near the best? Well, I'm saving the category of best till I taste to know the rest. Look here, do you come with this deal? 'Cause we sure could use the help around here. That roof leaks, for starts. Only thing is, you don't look like you work much labor. Miss Mattie, y'all trying to cut a deal with my man? Something you need to know about him, sweet pea, he a politician. Now, he can be bought, but he can't be had. Lifetime bachelor. Wanna bet we can't win him? You got something worth wagering? No? How about a dance then at the Blue Goose? What's the matter, you can dance, can't ya? Only thing is, I don't think you'd ever find out. - You sure? - Those wide loads of yours don't look none too graceful. Well, they know how to get out of the way of long feet trying to stomp on 'em. So, we on? A dance for me if I get through, and if, uh... if you win, well, I guess you got your dedicated slave, and that roof up there gonna get fixed. Oh yeah. - Shake. - Yes, ma'am... What you got there, girl? Cubans. I suppose after all that trouble with the Bay of Pigs, - I should've thrown them out. - You're right. Can't let politics stand in the way of a good cigar. Excuse me, Miss Gordon. It's been so nice around here that time just done run away with us. Congressman, you told me to remind you about the business you got at the Capitol in the morning. - Not yet, Walter. - Excuse me. You had too much to drink, you're starting to make promises you can't keep. I suggest we get away while we can. - Trust me. - Yeah. My apologies, Grace. Seems the specter of tomorrow has abrupted our festivities. Will I be invited back soon? I'll check my calendar. I am holding my breath, so please, - don't wait too long. - Come on now, Congressman. - All right, I got it, I got it. - Thank you. Well, all right. Ah, that is some good stuff. You got that right. That girl Jubilee ripe for the picking. There will be none of that, Walter. I don't want you muddying up these waters with your obsessive desire to mark your spot. This gonna be my spot. I might just throw in the towel. Retire, let those fine wenches take care of me. Retire, you? That's the wine talkin', boss. No, I've had an entire lifetime of managing the world order. I wanna just float. Ain't gonna be no floatin' around here. That Jubilee already taking bets about me doing some roof. Know what I'm saying? There's gonna be no retiring. "All good men should come to the aid of their country." - Oh, God, what's the time? - 7:30. - What... what you doing? - You know, out of 60 ads, there's only eight for women, and only one of those barely applies to me. What they payin', babe? Pay dependent on skills. The plant person at Sea Graves Trucking... Hello. I'm Grace Gordon, I'm here for the job of girl Friday. Here, fill this out. Over there with them others. Do you have a pencil? Thank you. Yeah, you better get out here. My office is fillin' up. Y'all here for the job? Yes. My husband's been out of work for a few months now. We got two kids, and... we're staying with his sister's family. I gotta get out of there before they drive me crazy. My mother can't work no more. I'm supportin' us both. What you here for? Extra spending money? No. I'm also here for my family. Okay, what we got here? All right, uh, May Jones. Yes, sir, I'm May Jones. Can you type, honey? Yes, sir, a little. But, if you hire me, I bet I can do just about anything you ask me to do. Ooh, that's the kind of answer I like to hear. All right, uh, Nell Brown. Mm. Uh, see here you got experience. Type 100 words a minute? Yes, sir, I take shorthand, sir, and if you need, sir, do your accountant work, too, sir. Hm. And you. Grace Gordon. - Yes, sir, that's right. - You graduated from Hollins College with a degree in... 19th century poetry? - Yes, and I also have... - Married? - Divorced. - Hm. And I also type, not as quickly as these ladies, but if I'm given the job, I can certainly help this place look less like a... like a truck stop. As the adage goes, "A man is judged by his appearance," and I can certainly help with that. Hm, divorced? Okay, let's have a quick turn around, girls. All right, lift skirts a little bit. Are we applying for the chorus line or a secretarial job? Everything must be appealing, didn't ya say? Let's go in the back, honey, come on, let's go know each other a little bit better. Oh! Well. I guess the interview is over. Yeah, I think he got all he needed to know. I'm too ugly, and you're too bossy. This is The Secret Storm, brought to you by Dristan. The measure of our leadership is in rebuilt inventories, increased production all along the line. The measure of our leadership is the measure of the future. When'd you get this? Brought it in a few days ago. Mrs. Grace Gordon came in proud as you please. That belonged to her grandmother. - Hm. - Can you just imagine all those society evenings? - That's fancy. - Well, did you know she lived in Paris, France, for a while? Hm. She must be hard up for money. It's the same car, the one with the New York plates. I'm tellin' ya, something is goin' on. Sure, George. Probably Time magazine come all the way down here to report on paint drying. - Where? - Right there, the black sedan. - That one right there? - Right there. - Hello. - Oh! Well, look at you, fresh as a daisy. We were just talkin' about your valuables. Oh, was anything sold? Well, no, not yet. All right, well. Whoops, better get back to work. I am in need of a little more money for something special I'm working on, and I wonder how much I could get for these. I mean, it's costume jewelry, but, - anything? - Well... ...these are very beautiful. Wish I had someone to give 'em to. You know, Dick, you should buy something like this for your wife. - Do something nice. - Why? She ain't give me nothing but a hard time. Well, that's no way to be. I can loan you $35 to $40 for the lot. You know, I was thinkin' about you the other day. Here's, uh... Have a look at this here paper. It says, uh, "Make the world a beautiful place, and make money doing it. Avon is coming to your area, and there's new territory for sale." Maybe this is for you. Door-to-door sales? Honey, 60-day loans roll around real fast. Yeah, and I may have managed to stage a narrow escape. We'll see. - Right there. - Well, I didn't count on that. Well, I'm guessing you will. I can do this here. What do you think of that? - Uh-huh. - Oh, Congressman, I can see you're up to your same old tricks. I might have one or two left in the bag. - I can say... - Oh, well, just say it. I win. Congratulations, Earl. Yeah, I think this is the first time in two or three years you beat me, well, well done, well done, my friend. All right, Tiny. That is my last four bits. Robbery. You know, you should be ashamed of yourself treating your congressman like this. I gotta go, boys, I got work to do, but I wanted to give you a little something here. All right. Here it is. Tell 'em to have a look at this here. Oh yeah. A little gift for you, boys. Niggas got bones in their nose in Africa. God bless America, huh? - Congratulations. - Bones in our noses and wings on our backs. Now, boys, aren't y'all tired of being excluded? Huh? We gotta register ourselves. We gotta be in the system. We gotta be... we gotta be counted. Get out of here. You all right? - Watch your head. - That's crazy. Don't come around here. ‚ô™ If that mockingbird won't sing ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring ‚ô™ Avon. Hello? Avon. Hello? Avon. Avon calling. Here to make your day more beautiful. My man don't allow nobody on his property. I'm not here for him. I'm here for you and I got products. Ma'am, I ain't got no money. You're a beekeeper? Yes, ma'am. Well, that's beautiful. I always wanted to be a beekeeper. You don't want no run-in with him. Please go. Who is that on my property? Um... Well, I'm here to see your wife. Um, see if she's interested in some products. Well, she ain't go no money. So get. Go on now. Get on out of here. A girl should always have mad money. Every lady always needs honey. I said get, bitch. - Woo! - I got her! I got her, I got her! What? Help! What? Help! Good God Almighty, boys. What have y'all done? You from the truants' office? I told them boys to get to school, but they don't mind me. No, I'm Avon. I'm here to make your day more beautiful. Reading, writing, and 'rithmetic don't mean shit if all they do is produce heathens. Manners. That's what they need to be teachin' in schools. These heathens are your next citizens. Yes, you have a point. I'm not from the truants' office. Can you get your boy off of me? Leave that woman alone and act right for once. Not until you call uncle. Let go of whoever you've got this instant, Bobby Jo, you hear me? You hurt? A little. It's you, from the bank. Miss Grace Gordon. I'm Ruth, remember? Yes. If you don't mind me askin', what in the name of Sam Hill are you doin' here on this side of town? Avon, here to make your day more beautiful. But I'm... I'm not doing a very good job. Avon? To this neighborhood? Well, you landed in the right place now. Come on, I'll get you cleaned up. Thank you. Golly. Now you don't mind, do you, uh, comin' in, I mean, and gettin' somethin' to drink? Do you have bourbon? Why, yes, ma'am, we sure do. Then I'd be delighted. Girls, we got a caller. Things gonna make you even more beautiful. Come look. Miss Effie, we got Avon. Huh? Girls. Avon. Straighten up. - Here you go, Miss Grace. - Thank you. You got a room full of ready customers, don't she, girls? Everyone, this is my friend, Miss Grace Gordon. And she's here with some nice things. - Well, um... - That's right, baby doll. This is a hootchie-cootchie titty house. Queenie, stop it. Miss Grace, money don't know no prejudice, and we're workin' girls that got money. Well, that's right. Well, all right, come on. Right this way. I have some very nice items. Honey, we ain't lookin' for nice. Come on. Look at this. Scheherazade's Arabian Nights. Now don't that sound exotic? Shoot, sounds hot to me. And expensive. You're cheap, Queenie. Bet you got the first dollar you ever got laid for. Don't you worry 'bout what I got. You got anything to cover this in that bag of tricks? Here. Did someone hit you? Some people think hurtin' you comes with the price of the ride. It's okay. Miss Effie keeps a gun. Scheherazade. Who was she to get a perfume named after her? It's Scheherazade. Now, let me tell you about her. See, in a far away land, there was a king. And each night, he chose a wife. And every day, he beheaded her. You know why? 'Cause he didn't want her to be unfaithful. But when Scheherazade was chosen, she outsmarted him. She spun a tale that was so intriguin' that the king kept her alive for 1,001 nights just to hear more. And then she became his queen. This day started off just like any other regular day and then you dropped in and made it magic. No, you've been the one doin' all the sellin'. You'd be good at sales. No, no one's gonna hire an uneducated hillbilly like me. Nah, I gotta play to my assets. Plus, I got a little girl to take care of. I'm gonna make sure she's educated. She's gonna be a fine lady like you. All right, girls. Tea party's over. Ruth, Bay Bay, you're on the window tonight. It's a two-drink minimum, on top no matter. Come on, get a move on. I hope our paths cross again. I won't speak up or nothin', just smile, if you won't mind it. Of course. Honey, you got your order ready. You need to pack it up. We got business. Yeah. All right. What did y'all learn at school today? Wow. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. $6.70, and then two Skin So Softs at $5.78. $20.03. Easy money. Sorry, did you just do that in your head? Got a head for figures, I guess. Yes, you have. And for sellin'. You should do somethin'. Somethin' better than this. Better? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. It's just that... you could. You're... useful. This ain't no regular life for you, but I was born on the wrong side of the tracks. Ain't got no education to speak of. But I'm a saver. Baby, you're gonna miss the start of your show. - Okay. - Go on, get your study books. - Bye. - Bye. Well? How do I look? I look all right? Yeah. All right. For your future. Which one of these you want to use tonight? Which one makes me look thinner? You ask a lot of these jackets, Congressman. The art of flattery will only assist you, Walter. You gonna stay the night? Up to the lady, of course. I do believe I have won my way into her good graces. Congressman, don't get all caught up. This woman is used to nothing but high living. There's a lot of work to do over there. Walter, I've been playing this game since before you were a gleam in your father's prick. No tie. Yes, sir. Mattie? Jubilee? We in here. All right, what's goin' on? The man done turned us off. He said they're a power company not a charity business. Oh my God, what else can happen? Congressman called, said he was ridin' into town and said we sure would be a good sight to see if we wasn't doin' nothin'. With no electricity? Please do not tell me that you invited him over. We've got to close this deal tonight, baby. We in the dark. After the day I've had. How am I gonna pull that off? I'm glad to be goin' someplace where there's not a care in the world. - Yes, sir. - And one of God's sweetest creatures is gonna be treatin' me like I'm all that matters. Oh, Lord. What's goin' on? They sent one of them rabble-rousers down here to stir things up. - Rabble-rouser? - Yes, sir. Is that one of King's men or one of those crazies from Chicago? One of King's men, and a commie reporter too. Dammit. Streets are safe. Plenty of jobs. I'd say we've created a kind of utopia. I wouldn't go that far. What did you say, Walter? Look at you, hm? Driving a Cadillac, getting all the snatch you can handle. Hm? Back seat. You've had your fair share of the pie in your day too. My day? This is still my day. My forefathers wrote the Magna Carta and the Constitution and the Boy Scout manual, three of the finest documents ever written. And I'm still writin' damn good law. Only thing missing today is gratitude. Congressman, they just sayin' why can't a negro man eat where he wants? Drink from the same fountain, piss in the same pot? What's that all about, huh? Hell, Walter, let's just get to where there's no trouble and no talk of change. Hm, hm, hm. Now what's this all about? What the hell? Y'all blown a fuse? Welcome! Well, what have we here? Scheherazade awaits. Follow me. Boss, be careful, this looks like a trap. Lead the way, my sweet. Mm. Lead me away. Jubilee, Jubilee. Shut up. Grace. My Grace. What do you have on your mind? And will I live up to the challenge? Well, I think you'll manage just fine. Come curl up under. Let's enjoy the world. Sounds like a perfect plan. They say we're movin' a thousand miles an hour through space. Yet down here it feels like we sittin' still. Mm-hm. Yeah. This is all just an illusion, really, isn't it? See, when I was young, I used to see those lights in the distance. They'd sparkle like diamonds and I thought... ...I was curious to see what they were. After all of your travels, you finally found that there's no place like home. Mm. Come on. What? Let's swim in the moonlight. Come on. I double-dare you. Beautiful. Oh, God. Oh my God. All right, oh... Geronimo! God dammit! I'm comin'. Whilst he... Who truly took it from them... I'm readin'! - You don't like me readin'? - I'm listenin'. Huh? You look damn fine, little girl. Go on. Go on, back it up in that chair now. Ooh! I'm gonna go get me another drink. I'll be back. My man. Good night, right? Yeah. Say, Walter... Walter. I need your man to send around a cruiser. What's going on? Uh, white trash I've never seen before been ridin' by whoopin' it up. I feel like combustion is on its way. - I'll talk to him. - All right. Well, well, well. If it ain't Mr. Rabble-rouser himself. How you doin', sir? Abel, set this man up a drink here on me. Ah, I'll take a shot of Johnnie, and I'll buy it myself, all right? - I don't need... - Well, come on now, brother. Just trying to be hospitable. Oh. Trying to set me up, huh? - That's all you, baby. - Hm. Come on, pretty boy. - Uh-uh. - Dance with me. Show old Viola how you move. Careful with our V. She might bite. - Very good. - Mind your business. Look what we have here. Let me get a water. Hello. Hey. How you doin'? Fine. Abel, give her a real drink. No. Water's fine. I suppose that you came to dance with old Walter. Oh, we didn't lose. But you ain't won yet either. You scared? Ow! Whew! Hey, hotshot. Pour me one. And then you and me do a little bump and grind. Vi, you need to calm down, cool off. Come on, what you want, a Coca-Cola? I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Hm? I don't want no Coca-Cola and I don't wanna cool off. There are all these men for you to dance with, so. Go on, get out, you're embarrassing yourself, I'm with this lady. Go on. - Can I get another drink? - What you want to drink? And you ain't gonna get no water. Coca-Cola. You with this fresh meat? I'm with myself. Yourself, huh? Yeah. Well, you young and sassy now, but you gonna get old and used-up fast, gal, 'cause nigger women at the bottom of the rung that everybody's stepping on. Agh! Y'all so fired up about civil rights? Oh, y'all are quiet now. Boy from New York coming here talkin' 'bout Jim Crow. What about Jane Crow? What about us? What about us? Here, drink a cola and don't worry about all that. She just liquored up. It's not the liquor, she's cursed. She's cursed? Yes. She wants to feel alive but don't have a chance. Shit, she ain't nothin' but an old bar whore. Liquor all she want. She's like my mama. High hopes and low expectations. I don't wanna end up like them with no hope for better. Well, you ain't like them. A real fine lady. Walter, come on. You need to stop. All right, come on now, we gonna need to get along. We gonna be seeing a lot of each other. Us with all of this time we got in the world. Y'all with all that money. Wait. What you mean, us with all the money? No, wait, we the ones with all the time and you the ones with all the money. Nah, that's not how this deal goes. You mean to tell me your man over there ain't got nothin'? My man ain't got shit. He done bought every last swamp deal there is. We been sacrificin' while treatin' y'all like kings. Woo. Well. Looks to me like you've been baitin' a catch. Here. I don't want you to think you gave me nothin', 'cause you ain't nothin' to give. Well, you too hard on me, girl. And you too light on yourself, Walter. Come on, Jubilee, we gonna talk about it, baby. You gonna come back? - Kiss my ass. - Come on. I'd love to kiss your ass. Come on back. You fine as any... look at you twistin' your hips like that. I love you, girl. Boss. - Psst, boss. - Hm? Boss, come on. You scared the piss out of me. What the hell are you doin' here so early? We gotta go. Come on, man. Man is supposed to relax on the Sabbath. And they probably plannin' fried chicken for lunch. There ain't gonna be no fried chicken, no more love makin', no morning bakery. - We gotta go. - What the hell - you jabberin' on about? - We're overstayin' our welcome. Ah, thank you very much, Jubilee. You folded the clothes, I appreciate you. Grace? All right, ma'am, we gonna get get out your way. Come on, boss. Jubilee, you want a piece... Damn. Things were gonna be so good. Puttin' the weight of the world down. But she was only after... What they all after, Jack, and you ain't got jack shit. I'd appreciate it if people spent a little less time on my few faults and concentrated more on my many attributes. You a good politician. She didn't want to get used. Hell, I get used all the time. I'll think it over. Hm. This is Grace Gordon. If you're there... ...please give me a sign. No. I didn't think so. Oh. And here's the pitch. Sorry, ma'am, we're between breakfast and lunch. I can get you a cup of coffee if you want. No, I'm here about the advertisement. The hostess job? Yes. You ever work before? I've been a hostess my entire life. A hostess, huh? Well, I think I could make a difference here. How much you expectin' to get paid? How much you payin'? Someone like you, no skills, a dollar an hour. I'll take it. When you plannin' on startin'? Today. Okay, well, come on back, I'll introduce you to the girls. - Okay. - Follow my rules around here. $8.50, hardly worth draggin' my ass out of bed. Having to listen to all of that complainin' about this crappy food. Well, you get what you give. I made $15 'cause I treat my people right. That's right, I keep forgettin'. Our little do-gooder just loves wipin' somebody's ass for a dollar. We've been over this too many times, Aileen. What we're doing here is called capitalism. I get paid according to my own effort. Just do a better job. You need to quit readin' them books, Teresa. That's why you don't have a ring on that finger. 'Cause no man wants a woman spoutin' out your kind of crazy. And how's havin' a man worked out for you, nitwit? Havin' your own money is freedom. All right, girls, I'm not payin' you to argue. - Hi, Grace. - Hi. We're not arguin', it's just Teresa spoutin her normal retard shit. What the hell's all this? Oh, another day laborer walked out. Well, I got somebody who can help with that too. Who the hell are you? Well, all right, bring 'em on by. See, all right, you've all been complainin' about needin' some help. What's she gonna do, give out fashion advice? She's gonna do the seatin' and she's gonna help you clear your tables, and you're gonna give her 10% of what you get. 10%? You're gonna starve us out of here? Well, I believe you can make this place at least 10% better. Thank you. Two eggs, over easy, two hash browns. Toast. Third time today I've seen them redneck boys go by. Looks like trouble to me. Yeah, I know. I've been keepin' my eye on 'em. They're lovin' these cakes you've been bringin' in. They're nearly licking the plates clean. They may be lickin' the plates of my cakes clean, but not these plates with this nasty food. Shut up, girl, and get back to work. I hate this place. Mm-hm. We have talked for a hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter and to write it in the books of law. I urge you again, as I did in 19 and 57, and again in 19 and 60, to enact a civil rights law - so that we can move forward... - Oh, for... - to eliminate from this nation - Shh. ...every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color. There could be no greater source of strength to this nation, both at home and abroad. Second, no act of ours means more security for those now working. More... Damn socialist. I'm lockin' up in back. You two watch the front for me. Good evening and you're welcome... Ma'am. If you don't mind, would you seat us. Now y'all know this is gonna cause trouble. Yes, ma'am, it probably is. Thank you. Come on, let's sit down. Oh my God. Oh my. Here we go. Oh, hell no. What? Agh! Come here, come here! What the hell? That hoity-toity seated them? And in my station? I'm not touchin' nothin' they put their fat lips on. Hey. Come here. God, woman, what the hell were you thinkin'? I can't serve Negroes. No one will put a foot in here again. They're well-mannered and they're polite. Don't be naive. They're lookin' for trouble. And so are those rednecks right there. Look here, I didn't plan on being center stage of their drama. One fork touches one pair of nigger lips... All right, hey, boys. Hey, let's just calm down. Shut the fuck up. You again? You seat these niggers? Well, I am the hostess, so, yes, I'm in charge of seatin'. You ain't in charge of nothin'. You want some of this, boy? Now, you keep your place like women are meant to. And the sooner you get that through your damn spoiled skull, - you don't matter shit. - Ow! Hey! She matters plenty. Hey... Hey. Hey, we did not come here for fighting. Spratz Diner. Good enough to get arrested. What you got up your sleeve, huh? We ain't got nothin' up our sleeves. - Mm-hm. - We got straight-out demands. And what's that? An appetizer. - Appetizer? - Mm-hm. That's more like a tantalizer. Miss Mattie, what's goin' on in there? We just tryin' to feed you, sugar. You women puttin' all your voodoo magic in food, tryin' to get him to do something he don't want to do. But you ain't gonna get him. And you ain't gonna get me neither. Who said anything about gettin' you? We ain't practicin' no voodoo up in here. What do you need of me? I'm at your service. It's the bill. The bill? What bill? The Civil Rights Bill. Oh, for God's sake. Not you, too. May we please talk about somethin' else? Cornbread. Delicious. Those look really fantastic. I thought you liked a good debate. Yes, a good one. Then I have one. Put women in. Women. Dear lady, women are not part of the debate. No one on any side has introduced that idea, includin' that Martin Luther King. He's at the helm of this movement now, and including women is not his intention. No, not this time. Then when? Without women, this country does not exist. It's time, past time, for women to be able to pursue their own happiness, their own liberty under the law. My fair lady, for thousands of years, all of us have agreed to call women the weaker sex. Now we all know it's not true, but it does make men feel needed. And men need to feel needed. A man's not needed, he's just gonna sit down on ya. We need to be your white knights, not your equal. The facts are many women have to take care of themselves. They scratch out a livin'. Unfairly paid for their work. And why? Because it's allowed because there are no laws, no protection. Now, with this bill, Lady Liberty might become color blind to men, but she still continues to turn a blind eye to what you call the fairer sex. You have me at a disadvantage. You'll be remembered for being noble. If I do this, I'll be remembered as a fool, if I'm remembered at all. - May I eat somethin' now? - Yes, you may. They do look good. - Ruth? - Yes. Ruth, it's Grace Gordon. - Hi, Grace. - Hi. Um... Boy, do I have a lot to tell you. But you know that... that bag of money you got? Mm-hm. Well, you ever think of investin' it? As you said, play to our assets. In all the years you've been scrapin' the sidewalks of DC, you two have never yet met? We travel down different paths. Mr. Celler travels with a union that doesn't think women are to be treated as equal. And, as you know, it's my lifelong ambition - to prove they should. - Don't misrepresent me. I've said that women should remain a protected class. Protected. That's better than equal. Oh. - Miss Powell. - Thank you. - Emanuel. - Oh, thank you. This isn't gonna hurt much. We've got a bill in Congress right now that wants to designate bourbon whiskey as a distinctive product of the United States. Think about that. Just a few short decades ago, this was illegal. Shows you how quick people can have their minds changed. So what shall we drink to, huh? Well, let's get right down to it. To fairer days for the fairer sex, and to amending the Civil Rights Bill to include women. Is that why you got her here, the bill? Now, Emanuel, hear her out. You won't melt. Well, there will be no undermining this long overdue issue. This bill is for the Negro man, not women. - Not now. - If not now, when? I believe Abigail Adams asked that very question. 188 years ago. Domestic violence and death, it just plays out across our land night after night, and the police refuse to even take the calls. They say she belongs to him. A woman doesn't have any real protection unless she has equal access to a job, to money, to freedom. And when they take off to have their child, who will replace them? That is a problem. And when they return to work, who will rear their child? Women occupy one of the most important roles in our society: motherhood. It is a man's job to protect the women. Now, Congressman Celler, let's not pretend that all men protect their women, nor are we instructing them to do so. And what you refer to as the most vital of all jobs is unpaid, in a land where the dollar is king. The mother is a pauper or a slave. To be absolutely fair, probably women will do some things I wish they wouldn't, but it's not our business to tell them what they should do with their freedom. But it is our business to make sure that they have the right to try. Gentlemen. Don't even think about this, Congressman, no piece of ass worth throwin' ourselves under the load about to hit us. Watch your language. I said I was gonna do this, so I will. Now, everything straight? Your face gonna be in the dictionary under T for Traitor. Walter. There are no faces of forgotten congressmen in the dictionary. It's all gonna be just fine. As long as everybody follows the rules. What we have works. If you are determined to keep this bill as it stands, there will remain only one group of second-class citizens in this country. Your mothers, sisters, wives, and daughters. Women. So good of you to help. It's the least I could do. After what you did for me and Angelina. Set us up in business. I'm Avon now. Door-to-door sales. And I've been meetin' all sorts of interestin' people. Women sellin' to women. It's the future. Sure is my future. Well, you tell her, I'm not gonna charge her interest. I want to help. That's awfully nice of you. - Come on, little one. - Come on, baby girl. Go on in here. Wanna see a trick? All right. You see this? You see it, right? Blow on it. Voil√†. Wait a minute. This is for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I will be at the opening night. Make sure Dick brings his wife, do somethin' nice for a change. Ruth... Would you be interested in calling it a date? A date? - With me? - Come on. All right. All right. Did she say all right? Yeah, she did. She said all right. All right. A date. You got a boyfriend. Oh, come on now. For women, huh? Negro men waited 300 years to get a seat at the table and what you do? Pull out a chair for 'em. Walter, you're gonna grumble about this for the rest of your life. - They're equal. - Mm-hm. You're equal, we're all equal. It's what we do with it now that matters. Never in history have those in power handed over such an opportunity. See where this takes us. Wait, slow down, slow down, there it is. Mm-hm. Any other bastard would have kept her in a gilded cage. I gave her an exit. I did it for them. For her. - Best table in the house. - Thank you. Well. - Thank you, Walter. - Yes, sir. Well, well, well. Look at what these women have done. Mattie. It smells like magic here. Doin' our best. Grace. You have managed to accomplish what 200 years of Congress could not. Everyone seated at the table. And I guess you won't need my services anymore. Hm, I'll need you, perhaps not, but... ...want? Tonight under the tree. And you think we'll make it past sunrise this time? Yes, ma'am. Hey, you, quit hogging the biscuits! I'll take care of this. Just like you always have to take what's not yours. Oh, I wouldn't miss it. Another time and place. So nice that we all get to break bread together, - isn't it? - Yes, sir. Especially in such a charming place. And those biscuits are the finest south of the Mason-Dixon line. And trust me, there's none good north of it. I just want to smash it in my face. - Mm. - Isn't that good? And always a pleasure to see you both. Enjoy your meal, enjoy your dinner. My goodness. I've never seen a table with such beautiful women in my life. Gentlemen, you better behave yourselves. How y'all doin'? Good? Ah, my man. Have a drink.
