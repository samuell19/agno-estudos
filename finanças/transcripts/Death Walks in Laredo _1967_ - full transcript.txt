Selby! Selby! Stop where ya are. Game's still goin' on. You're not walkin' out. A royal flush. Young man! Just a moment. Wait, are you by any chance Whitaker Selby? By chance, yes, why? I have a letter for you, from your father. For me, from my. Hey mister, my father is dead, 29 years. Yes, but he really died. Only, he died 10 years ago. He left you a gold mine, that's why I'm here. A what? A gold mine. I'm a lawyer. It's the truth, honest. My name is Leacock, Joshua Leacock. Now, you just start all over again, Mr. Leacock. Right from the beginning. I wouldn't lie to you, sir. No, sir. I received this letter with instruction to deliver to a Whitaker Selby. It contains your father's last will and testament. Oh, in it he says how sorry he was for the way he treated his wife, I mean, your mother. It's all quite legal sir. And the gold mine is in Laredo, Texas. And it took you 10 years to find me? No, it's just that the letter arrived 10 years late. I'm through warning you Whitaker, you and your pistol get out of town, right-- Save your breath, Sheriff. You don't have to run me out of town, I'll do it myself. I'm leaving Sharon Grove and Kentucky, tomorrow. No, no! Let me go! Let me go! You take care of him, will ya? He's too small for me. Go ahead, what the hell are you waitin' for? Kill him! I can't, it's my hand! I can't throw the knife! What are you waitin' for, dummy? Why don't you pull the trigger? I don't know, I can't move my finger. Get out you mangy dogs. Get out before I kill you. Get out. You were wonderful. How did you do it? Magnetism, my dear. Simple magnetism. Hey you, in the yellow shirt. Didn't I tell you to reign in your horse? But you had your heart set on winning that race, huh? Well, if you know what's good for you, you better stay out of my way, Jap. My name is Lester Koto. That still don't make you white. Don't blame me if your daddy went messing around with some Japanese gal. Yellow skin. Hey Jap boy. Magnificent. If you'll join my show, I'll give you $100 a week and I'll make you a star. I'm sorry, sir, I have another engagement. I'll get you out of that contract. Who holds it? His name is destiny, and he lives in Laredo, Texas. So long. Three riders All heading for Laredo Three strangers for Laredo Young riders, what brings you to Laredo Young strangers, why Laredo There's a secret we've been told In the mountain there is gold May be hell to pay, but we're on our way So we're riding, riding, riding Hold your guns in hand night and day, young man Or you'll never live to grow old Hold your guns in hand all the way, young man If you go in search of gold There's a secret we've been told In the mountain there is gold May be hell to pay, but we're on our way So we're riding, riding, riding Hold your guns in hand night and day, young man Or you'll never live to grow old Hold your guns in hand all the way, young man If you go in search of gold If you go in search of gold If you go in search of gold That's the third stranger in 24 hours. Know what? There's gonna be trouble. Mark my words. Real trouble. I was on my way to meet my only love On a dark romantic night with stars above I was singin' to the moon But I started sing too soon When I found his jealous hands on another too I got me a gun Who's coming to play I got me a gun Who's coming my way I was on my way to meet my only friend On a scarlet afternoon, as God would say I was dancing in the sun, but I found out why he's no fun When I found out what my so-called friend had done I got me a gun Who's coming to play I got me a gun Who's coming my way Now I got a gun, I know what way to go I'm as good a shot as anyone I know Well, you left me high and dry And I know the reason why When a girl has got two guns she's riding high I got me a gun Who's coming to play I got me a gun Who's coming my way I got me a gun Whiskey. I got me a gun I do it my way You new around here? Yeah. Know where Henry Langdon's ranch is? I only asked where Langdon's ranch is. Everybody out. You might be interested to know that you're the third stranger today that's asked for that information. So? Repetition's annoyin'. I see. Well, just consider I didn't ask. Don't be a wise guy. Me and my boys heard ya. So what? Hand over your pistols. You hear me? By the barrels, polecat. Hey you, Mr. Troublemaker. I was doin' my act, just like every night, and you had to come in and ask that stupid question. Then maybe you can tell me how to find Henry Langdon's ranch. Five miles away, just across the river. Are you satisfied. Completely. Buy yourself a drink. What do you want? To speak to Fuller. So speak to me. He can't see ya, he's too busy. There's a stranger in town raisin' hell. He's asking questions. He wiped out seven boys. Come on, follow me. Graceful, ah. Come bathe with me, you beautiful thing. And after six days of forced marching, Lectillus Marcellus and Cias Silla reached the gates of Rome, where meanwhile Caesar had grown in power and splendor, esteemed by his friends, and and feared by his adversaries. That's great, Professor, I like that. Feared by his adversaries. What do you say to that, Bronson? It don't settle our problem. We just lost seven men, and you, and you take baths and listen to that stuff. You've such a small mind, Bronson. What do you know about it? I read only history. Do you know what history is? Mmm, no. Well history is... Now you explain it to him, Professor. It is the sum of the errors committed by those who have proceeded us. Did you hear that? By learning from history books, we make ours. Listen, Caesar. I ain't paid to think, but to look after your skin. There's a new guy in town who's got to be taken care of before it's too late. But I agree. Pistoleros will take care of the stranger, I pay them well, don't I? If that's how you want it. I'm ready, Professor, continue. Cias Tulus feared the wrath of Caesar, may it fall upon his head. He decided to enter the city under the cover of darkness, abandoning his horse in the open fields. He made his way on foot to the wall which encircled the city. Hands up. Are you hard of hearing, friend? I said get your hands up. Now you put yours up. Do you mind telling me what's going on here? Yeah? Okay, you laughin' hyenas. Hand's up! No guldurn tricks! One false move out of ya', I'll blast your heads off. With that gun? Your durn tootin'. Don't let her fool ya. It's a good gun. George Washington used it, and if it was good enough for the father of our country, then it's good enough for me. Hold on, Gramps, don't get so riled up at us. Can't go runnin' all over other people's property like a passel of prairie dogs! You can't do it, I tell ya! Now there you're wrong, Gramps. This here land's mine. This land is Langdon's, and nobody else's. - I'm his son! Wait a minute. But then... Then you are... Well, I can't believe it. Have you ever seen anything like this? By all the devils in hell, by golly! Let the Indians take my scalp if you ain't. Wait a minute, let me see. Of course, I'd know you anywhere. Sure thing, you're Whitaker Selby. Bet my gun on it. Oh no, you'd lose it. My name's Etienne. Then you're Lester. There's no doubt about it. You're Lester. Nope, Whitty. Want me to tell you somethin'? You're the spittin' image of your Pa. Eh, you not so much. So who's squawkin'? Well, come along with me, boys, and we'll celebrate. I gotta little whiskey hid away somewhere, and it sure is an occasion. Yessiree, Bob's my uncle. How'd you know we're gonna meet? I sent you them letters. I worked for old Langdon when he was alive. Your Pa got into a heap of messes. I always told him he traveled too much. Dang it all, where'd that blamed bottle get to? Ah, now I recollect. Drank it up. Well, don't matter. See here, in his own way, he never forgot your ma. He said there was nothing wrong in havin' kids by different women, just so your heart was big enough to take care of all your loved ones, and he had a big heart. He said that's how it was done in his Pa's country. Place with a funny name. Something like apples. Naples, that's it, or something like that. It don't matter, go on. Eh, I was speaking of them letters. Oh yeah, your Pa give 'em to me before he went away from here. Send 'em the day I die! Don't forget, Stanford, he said to me. Don't forget! So how is it we only just got them? Eh, I forgot about 'em. That's how it was. It can happen to anybody, can't it? The gin! Sure, on the roof! We'll celebrate good! Yessiree, Bob's my. Alright, let it go, let it go. You drank it up five years ago. Now you answer my questions straight. You said our Pa went away. Why? I don't know. I don't remember. They chase him out of town, maybe? I had nothin' to do with it. Don't blame me. It was the Sheriff and that lawyer from Huntsville. They said the land claim wasn't staked out proper. So Langdon left town without protestin'? I didn't say that. He raised the dicken's, even though it weren't worth the trouble. What do you mean it wasn't worth the trouble? I mean the mine. It ain't worth a plugged dollar. There ain't an ounce of gold in the whole mountain. What? Just what I told ya. Everybody in town knows it. Langdon never found anything in that blamed mine. Well, looks like we get nothing for our trouble. Seems like Langdon had his joke one more time. Say, do you recognize her? Who is she? I don't know. I swear, I don't know. I had nothin' to do with it. You gotta believe me, I-- Hands up. I said hands up. And don't try any tricks if you wanna stay healthy. This place is gettin' monotonous. It's the third time today somebody's told me to put my hands up. Get movin', you guys, you're headin' for jail. For what reason? Invasion of another's territory. Reason enough. This land belongs to Henry Langdon, and-- It belonged. For the last 10 years it's the property of Julius Caesar Fuller. All the land east of the river belongs to him. He won't get it so cheap. You're the ones that have to watch out. I've been told you killed seven men down at the saloon. You're under arrest. Take 'em away. Get a move on, let's go. So they're Henry Langdon's sons, eh? They may come in handy. Just a moment. You're beautiful, you know? What's your name? Tula, my Caesar. Tula? Where'd they find you? Hong Kong, my Caesar. Hong Kong, that's pretty far, isn't it? The Orient, my Caesar. Do you hear that, Professor? My fame has reached as far as the Orient. Listen here, Tula. Tonight, I want you to come to me, see? I'll be waitin' for ya. She's still only a child, Caesar. So was your daughter, and she came to me. Let's get back to our previous talk about Langdon's sons. I got an idea about 'em. I'm sure that before Langdon died, he wrote a will. He was a shrewd one. I gotta hunch the sons know where to find the gold. Heh, there's no gold in them mountains, Caesar. I think there is. Langdon fought bitterly. Not the type to do battle for nothing. He fought like a maniac before he quit those rocks. The gold's been hidden around here, the sons will lead us to it. Your Caesar has spoken. You've wild goose chased that gold for years, Caesar. We all know you got no results. That's true, I haven't found it yet, but this time I got a hunch about it, Bronson. I'd bet a million the Langdon boys will lead us right to the spot. I want 'em free. And watch 'em every second. Clear? You're the boss, Caesar, you're the boss. Well, Professor, am I not truly Caesar? Lana. Well, we can't really complain, can we? We've only been riding six or seven hundred miles a piece to lay our hands on a mine that's worthless. Now we find that even the land belongs to somebody else, and we wind up behind bars. It's a pretty good ending for the story, when you come to think of it. Tell me something, brother. Last night, out at the mine, what kind of trick was that? I couldn't move my finger. Oh that. Only magnetism. I ordered you to stay still, and you obeyed. Look at this little pendulum, it'll find anything I want for me. Gold, for example. Watch carefully. Watch carefully. Voila! Does it always work. ...my boy. I'd be the richest man in the world if it really did. It's a matter of people, the surroundings, and a little bit of luck. What a pity. Otherwise you could tell that big gorilla to come and let us out. I'll try concentrating. Hey, maybe the guy's read my mind. Come on out. You too, come on out. Hurry up, now. What's this all about? Talk to the Chief. You're free, gentlemen. Fuller's withdrawin' his charges against ya. He said his men were drunk, it was they who provoked the fight. Well, that could be it. I'm not fully convinced. But he won't press charges against ya. You'll find the rest of your gear outside. And I advise you to be less trigger happy next time. Well, look who's here. Small world. I always say the same thing. I particularly dislike men who are too quick with their guns. And I always seem to find them under my feet. If I had anything to do with it, you'd have rotted in jail. Well, why don't you tell Fuller to throw us back in again? I suppose you get along pretty well with the bigshots around here. It's my business who I get along with. And anyhow, Mr. Fuller isn't just a bigshot, he's a very generous man. Well, it's not hard to believe lookin' at you. I'm sorry, I... Hey, how 'bout tellin' us what's in those boxes. Don't worry, one of these days you'll see. First they were in an awful hurry to throw us in jail, now they're in an awful hurry to throw us back out again. Doesn't make sense. There must be a reason, and we gotta find out just what it is. And how do you suggest we find out? By beginnin' at the beginnin'. How did the old man die. I'm sorry I can't help you, but I wasn't with the paper in those days. As a matter of fact, come to think of it, I joined it just a month after the death of, ah, what was that fella's name? You remember? Langdon, Henry Langdon. Oh, Langdon. That's right. So many of these old men die, it's hard to, you know, keep track. I understand, but where can we find the editor of this paper? I mean, the old one. But, I don't even know if that fella's still alive. I'm sorry, I really can't help you in this. If you want my advice, I suggest you give up this wild goose chase. You'll save yourselves a lot of trouble and useless effort. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Believe me. Thanks and okay. Glad to have been of help. By the way, who's the owner of this paper? Uh, the owner. I thought you knew, it's Mr. Fuller. Julius Caesar Fuller. Yes. Well, fancy that. Hey, listen fellas. Maybe I shouldn't be talkin' out of turn like this, but you look like honest guys to me. If you're lookin' for Olaf Simpson, go up the river as far as Red Springs. You'll find him there, alright. He's got himself a house, and he's been livin' in hidin' out there with those four sons of his. But you gotta remember, don't tell anybody I told ya, or it'll go real bad for me. Well, come on boys, I gotta idea we're on the right track. Laredo, Laredo. Okay, you guys. Stop where you are. And put down your guns. Just what do you guys want here? Olaf Simpson, we wanna talk with him. You won't find him here. Go back to Fuller and tell him he's wastin' his time. Go on, keep movin'. You're mixed up, Sonny. You're not gonna stop us with that there toy. Us Simpsons ain't dumb. Now get goin'. Us Langdon's ain't either. What'd ya say? Did you say Langdons? That's right. I'm sorry. I'm Larry Simpson, glad to make your acquaintance. We thought you were Fuller's men. Me and my brothers, we gotta be on guard all the time. My father's told us a lot about old Langdon. He'd be glad to see you. Your face reminds me of somethin'. Why, sure, Whitaker Selby. I can still see the headlines. You were a Sheriff. You were on trial, and they put you in jail on account of you wiped out those Spangor Bandits. They got you out of the way because you were an honest man. Sure, I recollect. Yes, you got the right to know what happened to your father. Fuller had him killed. Fuller was in cahoots with a lawyer in Huntsville to make it look like the mine was his. An old law about staking claims, that's all I know. Langdon wouldn't take it lying down, and got murdered. They said he was thrown from his horse, but they were lying. I wrote it up in my paper, and you know what happened? Fuller hired a new editor, and I had to strike out with my four boys. Since then we've lived in hiding. Maybe he's forgotten about us, but with that devil you never know. What happened to a little girl that was with him? She wasn't really his daughter. I think he adopted her when she was only two or three years old. Sorry, lads, I can't help you much on that point. Maybe she was killed too. Well, thanks for your information Mr. Simpson. Pleasure meetin' ya. Good luck, son. Get inside, quick! What's going on? It's Fuller's men, we gotta go back. Okay! That's stupendous. Magnificent. You handled the situation brilliantly. It's worthy of being recorded in the annals of history. I suppose I should reward you, eh? Or a medal? A medal for you too? And you? Idiots. You damn fools. Now take it easy, Caesar. Gettin' all worked up ain't gonna help any. Ah, really? Tell me more. 30 of my best men were shot to pieces by, by three novice fighters. Three, and I'm supposed to take it easy? Look here, I swear that tomorrow at the very latest those guys'll be dead and gone. Believe me, Caesar. Yes. Amaze me. I gotta idea. You? - Yeah! You got an idea? - Yeah! Bronson. Listen to me you bungling idiot, if those three men aren't taken care of in 24 hours, you better not show your fat face around here again if you know what's good for ya. You understand? Okay, Caesar. Okay. During one of his frequent epileptic attacks, Caesar. As I walked out in the streets of Laredo As I walked out in Laredo one day I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen Wrapped up in white linen Whiskey. As cold as the clay Come sit down beside me How 'bout a little bet, Lester? Who me? Oh no. Come on, trust my sixth sense. Okay. Put $10 on the red. On the red? Yeah. Concentrate Etienne, don't wanna make any mistakes. Round number three. 24 black. Just a minute, are you tryin' to cheat us? That's bright red, my friend. I'm terribly sorry, Messier, but it came up... I was positive it came up black. You were mistaken. It can happen to anybody. The money, please. Well, what do you want? A couple of answers. And what are the questions? First, where can I find Caesar? Second, what's a cute thing like you doin' in a place like this? May I answer them in order? Any way you like. Good. You can find Fuller at his ranch. Any fool in town knows where he lives. Second, I do this job for my living. It's clean work. No matter what you have in your filthy mind. I think Fuller is a murderer. I think he owns everybody who works for him. Alright, you've told me off. You're such a virtuous gentleman. 22 black, I'll be damned! It's red again! I'll take the dough. Nine red, impair and passe. That's just about enough. I saw with my own eyes the little ball jump into the red when the wheel stopped movin'. What if it did? Well, I don't fancy tricks of magic. what are we gonna do? I'll show you. Very good! Fire! Stop, I could get killed! Stop shooting! Come with me, hurry. We're singin' songs for Caesar We're pumpin' the stump for Caesar I'm tellin' ya, Caesar's one of the best One of the best In the name of Caesar We'll drink and jump for Caesar I'll tell ya Caesar's one of the best The bravest guy in all of the west We're singing a song for Caesar Tula will dance for us. Tula, feel the magic wind arising Hear the pounding of my heartbeat You've lit a fire in me that's burning Tula, Tula, Tula, Tula, Tula Well, if only I could hold you In my arms and love you Oh, my Tula Oh, my Tula Tula, Tula, Tula, Tula, Tula Be my sleep and be my supper Be my love, oh Tula Bronson. What the hell happened to you, Bronson? Listen, Caesar, them three ain't human. They're devils. Don't worry about it, ya hear? You're not angry with me? No, I'm not angry. Professor, explain how a wise man differs from the others. He controls his passions and uses them to his advantage. Hear that, Bronson? He uses them to his advantage. Beautiful how it works. With the Langdons? You've gotta have a Caesar brain, like mine. What's your plan? It's so easy, Bronson. I'll bait the trap. This is it. Now you go around the mountain over there. You'll find a pass which will lead you to the cave of the great spirits. It's an old Indian burial ground, nobody'll look for you there. Meanwhile, I'll go and get water and food provisions, alright? Good luck. Thank you, very much. Mady. What is it now? Another question? Well, I. I just wanted to tell ya. Well, I feel like a blamed fool. I knew that all along. Well, goodbye. Ridin', ridin', ridin', aha! She said she'd be back with water and provisions. And you believe what a woman tells ya? They're all part of the game, for what they're worth. Sometimes they're stupid, sometimes fun. They can be useful too, if you don't get trapped. I've never had that problem. Oh, Lester, you've got a real kissy nose. Don't you think so, Etienne? Yeah. Hurry! Hurry! Oh, thanks. I didn't know what I'd have done if you hadn't come. I was so afraid. Glad we could help ya. Yeah. You'll forgive me, I'm really a mess. My name is Deborah Smith. I live close by. Pleased to meet ya. Name's Selby, Whitaker Selby. Etienne Devereaux, Mademoiselle. I'm Lester Koto. American too? Sure, don't I look it? Oh yes. Well, I'd like to repay you all, but outside of a good dinner, I-- Did you say dinner? Yes. You mean, you mean something I can sink my teeth into? I understand. Come along, boys. Hi! Just a few minutes from here. Good! Etienne? Etienne! Come on, chow's on! Come and get it! Here you are. Enjoy yourselves. Stew! I haven't had stew since I had the mumps. Hey you guys, leave some for me, will you? Don't worry, there's plenty for everybody. Bread! Thanks! Mmm! Heavens, how silent you all are. It's so good. Don't you know you shouldn't talk with your mouth full? That's alright, boys, take your time. I'll talk for ya. You live here all alone? My father's dead, he left me this house. After a lot of hagglin', it was turned over to me a year ago. On my 18th birthday. Say, how do you get along? Oh, excuse me. That's all right. There's nothin' wrong with askin' that. I'm a nurse. I haven't got much experience, I've only been at it a short time. Meanwhile, the doctor lets me help with his patients. You know what I think, Debbie? You're a great girl. Because of the stew? No only because of that. And where do you all come from? That's a long story. We were supposed to take possession of a certain piece of land. That our father had left us. Your father? Don't tell me you're brothers. That's about it. - Uh-huh. You see, the whole thing's a bit complicated. We never knew the old man. What's wrong? Nothin'. Only, it's so strange. I never knew my father either. I was adopted when I was just a little girl, and this is the only souvenir I have of my childhood. Whitty? Whitty? Be reasonable, boys. What's the sense of keepin' on with this awful silly feud. Just for revenge? That mine's not worth a cent, and the law's against us. Money's not the most important thing in the world. Well, we just found a family we didn't know we had. And you've all, well you've all become fond of each other, and you need each other. Why should we hang around here? It'll only lead to trouble. You know if we sell this house and the land, we'll have a nice nest egg set aside. We could build a new life. In California if you'd like. They say there are lots of opportunities out there. What do you say? I think the same way you do. After all, it's the only sensible thing to do. I'm sorry Whitty, but I agree with Etienne. Anyway, old Langdon was just an unknown commodity to us up until a few days ago. Ol' Langdon, huh? Why don't you try sayin', my father? What difference would that make? It makes a lot of difference. It's easy enough to say, I don't give a damn about ol' Langdon, but try sayin', I don't give a damn about my father. Go ahead, try it. Come on, Whitty, don't exaggerate. He was an old drunk with wanderlust. Whitty! Let him alone, Debbie, You can't do anything with him. He's crazy. Sure, I'm crazy, but not as crazy as you think. Fuller would have had to settle his accounts with all of Langdon's sons, but now he'll have to settle his accounts with me, alone, and that will be enough. Hey, Doll. Move, Dog. She made a fool out of you, Bo. How 'bout some piano music here, fella? What are you doin' here? You weren't expectin' me, were ya? What did Fuller say when he didn't find anybody in that God forsaken cave? Is that what you think? That I? That's right. But it didn't work out the way you thought it would, did it? And now the time has come to square accounts. With you and your good friend Fuller. Both of you are gonna pay dear for my father's death. I wouldn't hit that there girl if I was you, son. You get outta here, you ol' drunk. I'm stayin' right here. And if you got the guts to hit an old man, then go ahead and do it. But first I suggest you look at this. You don't mind, Honey? No. What's this? Well? Now what else do you need to convince you? That paper shows the property still belongs to Henry Langdon, and that's for sure. What's this document doing in her possession? Because she just happens to be Langdon's adopted daughter. Her? Yes, me. Then? Then you knew all along that I was? Right from the start. Only Stanford and I thought you were one of the usual vultures, who didn't care about anything but gettin' your hands on the money. Now I know I was wrong. But somebody should teach you some manners, you know. Then it was Fuller that got us mixed up with that, that, girl. What girl? The one that, look, I don't have time to explain, I've got to get word to Etienne and Lester before they're too full of stew. They're at a little farm about five miles from here, just beyond the bend in the river. I know the place. Deborah Smith lives there. And she's one of Fuller's women. Yeah, but they don't know that. I'll show 'em how things stand. Okay, tell 'em I've gone to Fuller's place, they should understand that. Then go to Huntsville and give this paper to the federal judge there. Yes. I'll see you back here if everything turns out alright. Oh, Whitty? What? Good luck. Thanks. Well, come on Uncle Stanford, I'd like to meet Mr. Julius Caesar Fuller. With pleasure, my boy, with pleasure. That's it. Everything ready? Who's there? A strange woman. Congratulations Miss Smith, the trick worked out to perfection. That hussy, she was paid to bait a trap against you. And well, it looks like she succeeded. You stay out of this, this is my affair. But what's goin' on here? You witch. You'll get yours. Oh! Oh! Hey! No, watch them. Hey you two, Whitty's gone to Fuller's place, why don't you go and help him? Don't just stand there gawking, he needs your help. Look, wildcats. Why are you doin' that? Because Langdon was, you wretch you! Who was Langdon? He was. He was my father. Oh sure, your father. Your father? Yes, but don't you understand? Whitty's gone to Fullers. To Fullers? He's in for big trouble! We got help him, come on, let's go. We're almost there. Don't make any noise. Look, there it is. You're trapped, Selby! What a surprise. So your Langdon's son, huh? The one that's gonna kill Julius Caesar Fuller. You're mad. You'll finish like your father. Have fun, Bronson. What do we do with this one? That one's nothing, let him go. Some day I'm gonna kill you, Bronson. I swear I'm gonna kill ya. He needs a little freshening. You're so quiet, Tula. Is that because we're roasting a pig? Pigs are good roasted. That day, the omens were numerous, but Caesar paid no attention to them. You might find somethin' else to read, Professor. Somethin' pleasant. But we've gotten to this point, we can't turn back. You're talking a little careless, Professor. Watch out you don't make me angry. Maybe another bit to drink, huh? Swing him. Come on, faster. That's right. Come on, swing him. He's roastin' real good, huh? Come on, more wood on the fire. Bronson. Stop swinging him. It's time he went to hell. It was just a snake. I shot his head off. Easy Whitty, we'll take care of everything. Oh no, he's all mine. Etienne! Where are you going? What's gotten in to you? Don't leave me! Bronson! Out of my way. Bronson! Bronson! It's me, Fuller! Damn you! What are you waiting for? Escape like the others. There's no escape for you. You shut up. The day of reckoning. I have waited all my life for this. Shut up, Professor. Ever since you betrayed my little girl, and let her die. Quiet! Now it's your turn. Well, I guess we're all set. We can go now. Come on, Whitty, let's go. Poor boy. Mr. Selby? I mean, Mr. Langdon. You've got to make up your mind. Either you pay $3000 back taxes and property transfer, or I warn you, this land, cabin and all, will go to the state! Squatter's rights, mister. I won't budge. I just can't make you get off that bed. You're right, but I can make you leave this land, just the same. Step forward, men! Take him away. Isn't he stubborn? Come on, hurry it up. Let's move. You asked for it, Mr. Selby. Oh, I mean Mr. Langdon. Ready to go, mule-head? Whitty, would you answer me one question? Surely. What do you find so attractive about this bed, here? Well, let's see. Feathers? No. Gold. What is that? Hey, it's gold! What? Let me see. It is gold! You mean to say ol' Langdon left us a solid gold bed? How'd you find out? Make better use of your pendulum, my friend. I'm on a solid gold bed! Yeah, baby! There's a secret we've been told In the mountain there is gold May be hell to pay, but we're on our way So we're riding, riding, riding Hold your guns in hand night and day, young man Or you'll never live to grow old Hold your guns in hand all the way, young man If you go in search of gold If you go in search of gold If you go in search of gold.
