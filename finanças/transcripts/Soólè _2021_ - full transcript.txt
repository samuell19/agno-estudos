I'm afraid we don't have any provision for these children this Christmas. Maybe next year. Reverend. You said this to me last year. And the year before that. I understand but see, from where I'm sitting right now, it's not going to be possible. Reverend, what am I suppose to do? Make do with what you have, right? The children will be fine. Reverend, these children need to feel loved. They need to be included in the festive period. I know. See, we have provision of some money for them but it's in next year's budget. Truth be told, this money can barely cover the cost of taking care of the children. We haven't factored in that some more children could walk in. And the galloping inflation in the country. - Driver. - Yes ma. - Please, what is your name? - My name is Kayode. Mr. Kayode, do you know where I can find soole heading to Enugu? Soole? I thought I was driving you to the park. No problem, let's go. - Please open your... - No problem. Thank you. But Reverend Sister, you don't look like anyone who boards soole. - Am I better than those that do? - Yes! How? You see, I do not know but what I know is that you are a reverend sister. You should not be entering soole. Well, I'm not a reverend sister, at least not yet. It does not matter my sister. See, you have to be careful with the vehicles you board. We are in Nigeria. - Mr. Kayode. - Huh? I will be fine. Please just take me there. Please. But why do you want to board soole? I'm stranded. Ha! That's serious. This country! East! What East are you calling? Better stay calm mister. You know you have not paid a dime. - What is wrong with you? - You know you just got here. - He's stingy never wants to pay. - Leave me alone! Remember you just got here. - Have I not given you money? - Who did you give the money to? This what he always does. He never likes to pay whenever he picks passengers here. - Are you a thief? Get away! - Are you calling me a thief? Don't worry, I will report you to the chairman. - That is how he behaves. - Leave this place! Look at him. This people want to kill me here. Maybe I should just use this vehicle for soole. This park thing is not working. East! - These people! - East! I think I should just leave already. Hey! - East? - East. - Ha! Nun. - Please, East. Are you both going? - Only me. - Just her. - Just you. - Only me. Child of God. - Your fee is fifteen thousand. - Why is that? Fifteen thousand is too much. Please, what is the last price? Child of God, how much do you have? What is the last price? Pay twelve thousand. Driver, twelve thousand is too much please. - How is that too much? - I beg you. Let us get going, you know we do not have a lot of time to spare. Please where is this bus headed? - Please, hold on. - Please. Reduce it to ten thousand. - Just take it. - Please. Okay, get on the bus. - Where is this bus headed? - Where are you headed? - Driver, put the luggage in. - I'm not the one going. I will put it in, just get on the bus. Driver put my bag inside, let me see. I will put it. Where are you going? I am not the one going anywhere. I am only sending this bag to someone. Where is the bag going to? - The person is in Enugu. - I am going to the East. - Driver. - Your fee is fifteen thousand. Driver please, collect ten thousand. You are not being considerate, you can see people are waiting for me. No problem, I will give you. - You will give me fifteen thousand? - I will give you. I will give you driver just help me carry the bag. - What is in this bag? - Clothes, only clothes. Madam, are you sure? You can check it, there are only clothes inside. - Open and let me see. - They are my goods. - Driver! - Put the bag in already. I will put your bag. Reverend sister, get into the bus. - Am I not the driver? - Please. This one too. Hurry. Get on the bus. Please, manage it. Driver, you can buy some water with this. You are a good person! This is the number of the person to call when you get to the destination. - The line is not connecting. - Yes, it will not connect now. Dial the number when you get to On its ha and it will connect. - Are you sure? - Yes. I believe you. Driver! - Thank you. - Go well. Perfect errand. Alright, let us leave now. Let us leave here people. Sister, where are you headed? Enugu. - Enugu? Your fee is fifteen thousand. - What do you mean? If I wanted to pay fifteen thousand will I not just go to the motor park? How much do you want to pay? I will give you five thousand. Urine does not run this engine, my sister. Why will a fine girl like you price so low? Okay pay ten thousand, let me help you. Driver, I have only five thousand. - Add something. - That five thousand is my exact budget. - You really mean five thousand? - Yes. Sister, that will not work. Please leave the… Please leave the entrance, so I can close my door. - I'll give you six thousand. - Eight thousand last. - Move away from my door. - Hey! I have heard you. Why are you angry, were you sent packing? Will you not put your bag in the boot? Aunty, what are you looking at, are you a thief? You are the thief. What type of a person is this? Why is your trouser torn, did you fight with a lion? You will fight with a lion. Do not give me problem on this bus. What kind of a person is this? - My sister. - Sir? Why don't you put that bag in the boot like the driver said? I have some fragile things inside. Good morning sister. Good morning. I didn't know this kind of bus does soole. Me neither. Come to think of it. Driver! - Driver! - What is it? Are you sure this bus will get to the East? Of course it will. Are you sure it will not breakdown? Madam, are you hoping it breaks down? Well if it does, I will collect my money. My sister, it is prayer. We can only pray that this bus carries us safely to our destination. Sister, it shall be well with you. God will bless you. Don't mind that woman. I don't normally do one chance like this. There is more than one chance left here. Oh no, I mean when I was on the ground I thought it was one chance. So, why did you do it? I spent all my money on the goods, so I didn't have much left. What do you sell? I sell… Sister, I'm not sure I should be having that conversation with you. Why not? I mean you're a Reverend sister and it's... A sister, not a reverend. I sell… Personal stuff. - Personal stuff. - Yes. - Like underwear? - Yes! Like underwear. Nuns wear underwear too, you know. I did not think about that. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I hopped on the road just like you did. And I came to Lagos for funds. But apparently, times are hard. Sorry about that. Thank you. Children, right? Yes. How did you know? You remind me of one of my school teachers. Sister Jovita. - Are you Catholic? - Oh no, but I went to a Catholic school. Yeah, I know I don't exactly look like a modest student. Modesty is overrated. You are a nun, you shouldn't be saying that. I know and it doesn't make it any less true. I like you already. So, I guess you are one of those 'do not judge a book by its cover' type. Oh God, no. Books are meant to be judged by their covers, that is why they are there. - Oh, I see. - But, I read a lot of books when I was younger. And most of them, they were without covers. I'm Justin a by the way. Justi-baby for short. Veronica. Enugu. - Driver, please stop. - Enugu, just wait! Driver. Coming, I'm coming. We are going to the East. - Driver, please stop. - Just wait and take a look at us. Wow. We have been trying to stop you but you refused to stop. But I have stopped now, let's get going. - How much? - Where are you going? We are going to Enugu. Enugu is fifteen thousand, don't you know the price? - For one person or two people? - Just one person. What sort of problem is this? -That's too much -What is it? What kind of human being are you? Where is this person from? So you came here to cause problems for me. - Are you a witch? - No, you are the witch. What is wrong with you? Madam, go sit in the bus. What is wrong with you too? Don't come and ruin my business, I beg you in God's name. You do not have any shame at all. Even a little, you do not have. See the pregnant woman you want to pick up for fifteen thousand. What is ah ah? Did I impregnate her? What is my business? Or is she your sister? - My friend, get inside the bus now. - You should carry me inside. Carry me inside. Don't spoil my business with your witchcraft. Do you understand? Driver, how much please? You should pay twelve thousand per person. Twelve thousand? For Enugu which is a stone throw? We can even get there on a bike if not for Madam being pregnant. - Which Enugu? - That one. Are you sure you know where you are headed? - What kind of... - Hold on. We are losing the day already, don't let the night catch up with you here. Enugu. - This man! - Enugu! Why are you making this your pregnant wife suffer this much? - Why are you doing this? - Hello, excuse me. - What is going on? - Madam Can you see yourself? -Let us go -Calm down mister. - Calm down mister. - Hey! - Don't spoil my business. - Calm down mister. Aunty, let us go to Enugu. My bus is going directly to Enugu. Don't touch my wife like that. Calm down mister! - Will you leave this place! - Mister! Hey you! Don't get involved in other people's business. Do you understand? It does not make sense. It seems this man is crazy. Justin a. Don't let me curse you. - I'm telling you the truth. - Please be quiet! You are talking rubbish. - Who is talking? - I am the one. From here? You want to drive someone to Enugu for fifteen thousand Naira? No! Madam, the man is only running his business. Whoever leaves home ought to have a budget for transportation. If you do not agree with his price, move on to another vehicle. But he is not supposed to charge them an exorbitant price seeing her condition. See, reverend sister, even if he charges five naira, some people will still beat it down. But that doesn't mean the young lady was wrong to help the man and his wife. - We should look out for each other. - That is true. - Thank you. - Thank you sir. Please come. Madam, take your bag off the passage so people can walk past. - Hurry! - Take it easy, am I playing? No but you are wasting time. Can you all see why I asked this woman to put her load in the boot? What sort of problem is this? Don't touch my bag. See, don't delay me with this bag, I'm warning you now. Please come have a seat, please come. Come. Sit down. Sorry. Take it easy beautiful woman. Nonsense. Mister, you have scored a goal. If the things inside get damaged, will you pay? - Will you pay? - Are you comfortable? See what she looks like. Get lost! ♪ It will be well with us ♪ ♪ We will be fulfilled ♪ ♪ In the name of Jesus that we are calling and depending on ♪ ♪ It will really be well with us ♪ ♪ It will be well with us ♪ Excuse me, let me pass. ♪ We will be fulfilled ♪ ♪ In the name of Jesus that we are calling and depending on ♪ ♪ It will really be well with us ♪ ♪ It will be well with us ♪ ♪ We will be fulfilled ♪ ♪ In the name of Jesus that we are calling and depending on ♪ ♪ It will really be well with us ♪ Excuse me please. ♪ It will really be well with us ♪ ♪ It will really be well with us ♪ - Amen. - Amen. You are blessed. God bless you madam. God bless you. Those of you that like to dress like prostitutes. Let me remind you that the trumpet will soon sound. If Jesus comes now, where will you be? If you die now, where will you go? Wait, sorry pastor I have a question. Why is it that everyone that has come into this bus, you've used them to preach? I'm only preaching as my spirit leads. Whatever he puts in my mouth, I will say. - Okay? - I think your spirit is rude. You say? Are you trying to tell me that out of everyone in this bus, you are the only one that is going to enter paradise? If everyone in this bus repents, they will all go to paradise. So please repent and go to paradise. Okay? Right. Let us pray. Our father and our God, we thank you. We thank you for waking us up this morning. We thank you because we know you are going with us in this journey. Father we know that as we are going in this journey, you are going with us. Father, we pray that any sin that we have committed. - Father forgive us in Jesus name. - Amen. - Forgive us in Jesus name. - Amen. Our father and our God, we pray that as we are going in this journey, No blood sucking demon will find us on this journey in Jesus name. Amen. - In Jesus name. - Amen. Thank you father. - Thank you father. - Thank you Jesus. - In Jesus name we pray. - Amen! - In Jesus name we pray. - Amen! God bless you. Yes. As you progress in the kingdom… Sister, brother please help me pass it. Sister. Oh, God bless you. Sister, God is coming soon. Sister, God bless you. The kingdom of God is coming soon. God bless you my brother. The kingdom of God is coming. Thank you. God bless you my brother. The kingdom of God... - I am here. - God bless you Madam. - God bless you. - Thank you It will get to you, don't worry. Yes, the Kingdom of God is coming soon. God bless you. Oh my sister, okay. Please, our Lord is coming back very soon. God bless you. Thank you. God will bless you. God will bless… In fact, you are blessed. Excuse me. Whatever the Lord is laying in your heart. To give for the work of the ministry. Please feel free to give. For the Lord loves a cheerful giver. Oh ah, God bless you my sister. - Are you kidding me? - My sister. Why are you giving him your money? Because I want God to bless my hustle. God bless you. Thank you my sister. - Wow. - God bless you. I don't understand. This man just insulted all of you, cursed you, told you you were going to die and go to hell. And you are gathering your money and giving it over to him. Mister. What is wrong with people in this country? I did not insult anybody. Okay? Please be careful. I was only preaching the good news. - Good news? - Yes. So, your good news is that people are going to die and go to hell. That is the gospel. If the people repent, they will not go to hell. Tell me, what is the bad news? Daddy, these are spiritual things. They are not for canal minds like yours. God bless you my sister, God bless you. - I am here. - Thank you. Sister have you giv… ah. Sister, have you given your own offering? - Have you given your own offering? - Oh. God bless you. - Come and take this. - Thank you. Reverend sister, are you not going to give him your own offering? I have something more important I am using my money for. Oh my God! Sister, what could be more important than the work of God? What kind of a stupid question is that? This man, be careful. Look at her. Does she look like she is doing the work of the devil? I wasn't talking to you, have some sense. Let her answer her question by herself, I'm not talking to you. Don't mind him Sister, what could be more important than the work of God? Do I owe you any explanation? Do I owe you any explanation to what I will be using my money for? I don't owe you anything. My sister, God will bless you for defending the faith. - God bless you. - Amen. - Pastor, have you finished? - I have finished preaching. Mummy, thank you. Daddy, thank you. My brothers and sisters. Sister, thank you. I come bearing good news. Business! Business. This one here is a strong herbal mixture. You know, it is good for weak erection. If you take this one, when you pump a woman one, two and you... And everything spills, it should not be. - You should be punishing a woman in bed. - Sister? Daddy, this one is for you. Weak erection. Sister, I thought you were defending the faith just now. Yes Pastor? - Faith without works is what? - Dead. - Dead. - Preach. No sister. This is wrong. Come, pastor. See, There is no hair on my armpit. What is this? You have hustled. Why won't you allow me hustle? You even collected my money. Okay, carry on. As a matter of fact, I want to know. What does this one do? - Old man. - Three thousand naira. You don't have erections? What is your problem? I mean, I am only just checking. Look madam, what is inside this one? Daddy, correct herbal mixture. - Good for your... - I know it's herbs. Yeah, I like herbs. I'm saying, what are the herbs that are inside.

I say move! - Go down! - Bring the bag. - Oh Pastor. - We are covered. That is not the bag. Are you mad? - Idiot. You are not worth it. - Please, this is a close range. - Pastor, they have gone. - They have not gone. Come back here! Blood of Jesus. Where are they? Blood of Jesus. Hey! My box. Blood of Jesus. Where are they? Do you know that woman? - What woman? - White blouse, blue wrap. No. Why? I don't know but she looks familiar. Where do you know her from? - I don't know. - Blood of Jesus.

I'm sorry, please take heart because I do not understand what is happening today. Driver. Are we going in the same direction as the armed robbers? What sort of question is that? Are you not going to Enugu anymore? Driver, I don't know. Is there another route we can take to get to Enugu? Reverend sister, do you know another route? If you know of another route, come and take the wheel. Driver. Come, Don't you know you are talking to a sister? Or do you want to be struck by thunder? Hey, please. Thunder will not strike the driver in Jesus name. Are you mad? - Take it easy. - Me? It is you that would be struck by thunder. - Driver. - Thunder will strike you. - Do you know I am a titled man? - Calm down driver. I just averted the curse on your behalf. Calm down. Don't upset me. I can hand you over to these robbers. Driver, I just averted the curse on your behalf. Did he ask you to avert anything on his behalf? What is this trouble? - I am not talking to you. - How will you talk to me? You cannot face me. The armed robbers we met on the road, you could not avert that one. It is imaginary thunder you are averting. Look at you, were you robbed? Were you? Were you? Were you? Look at you. Are you going to ask everyone who wasn't robbed if they were robbed? What about her that they snatched her bag? Look, the fact remains that everybody in this bus was covered. Nobody was armed in anyway. Oh, being robbed is not financial harm? Or the things that they took from her, she did not buy with money. Let her be thanking God that she is still alive. Whatever she lost in the bag, she can always buy back. Will you now contribute to that effect? Will you contribute to that effect, will you help her? As a matter of fact, we should contribute to her. My daughter, the things they took from you How much were they all worth? Five hundred thousand naira. God! - Five hundred thousand? - Yes? All I have here is a few thousands. Let me see. This is five thousand naira. Please my brother, help me pass it to her. Please, give it to her. Thank you sir. It's okay. Sorry, I know it is not enough but that is all I have. - Thank you sir. - Sorry sister. Thank you. Manage it. Thank you. Thank you everybody, thank you very much. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Sister, take. What am I supposed to do with this? Just add it to your money and buy something for the children for Christmas. I can't. Your merchandise was just stolen. It won't cover my loss. It is a start. I'm very sure the children need it more than I do. What are you going to do? I am alive. I'll work, make more money and I'll start again. I don't know what to say. It's fine. Thank you is enough. Thank you. Thank you so much Justi-baby Pastor, over to you. Are you not going to donate? Look. I will donate if only I know what she bought with the money. Yes. I will only donate if I know what she bought with the money. I cannot donate to sin. You this hypocritical bastard. You have no modicum of integrity. - Me? - Yes! You collected her money when she gave it to you. Then she was not a sinner, right? But now it is time to give to her, you suddenly remember she is a sinner. She gave it to the Lord. She gave it to the Lord. The Lord never came into this bus. It is still in your pocket. You are a thief! - Baba, what is it? - Me? - Look at you? - Baba! That is why your hair is running. - You are losing your hair. - Mister! Baba. This man has no integrity. If not because she is holding me, what I would have done to you now The Lord... The Lord did not call you. You are a robber. Nobody called you, you sent yourself. Were you there when the Lord called me? Pastor, hand him over to God. If not because of Jesus. If you wave that bible at me, I will slap you. If not because of Jesus. You think I care about this your nonsense? You think I am one of these gullible people you can deceive. Nobody called you, you sent yourself. Were you there when the Lord called me? That money they gave you is still in your pocket. - You haven't taken it. Bring it out. - My God will deal with you. You took it from these people, give it back to her. Okay, return her offering to her. - Come and take it. - See me, see trouble. You condemned her dressing but you took her offering. Come and take it. I said she gave it to the Lord. Somebody is now in need! Weaponizing bible and stealing from people. - Baba what is the matter? - Don't mind him! Is it by force? Leave this matter. Donation is not by force. If not for the gospel. But why was only her carried? - Oh oh! - Thank you very much. What really was in that bag? God bless you my sister. What is in it? See, let us not be collectively unfortunate. It is the people who did not donate anything who are speculating as to the content of that bag. Hold on! What is wrong with you? Look at me! Do not involve me. If you stretch that wretched book at me again Because I did not donate. Where is the offering? Has the Lord come into this bus to collect it from you? The Lord will defend me. Behave you ever met this pastor? Pastor, let me talk! Have you ever met this pastor? Have you ever met him? - Boss, there is a problem. - What happened? Our guy on the bus says we carried the wrong bag. Are you sure? He is sure. He says we carried a ladies' bag. And why am I just hearing about this now? He says his network is bad and he has been trying to reach us. Stop the car. Fuck I… What are these? - Boss, they are penises. - Penis? - Rubber penis. - Where is the money? - It is inside the bag, it is here. - Inside where? It is inside the bag. I found it when we carried it. There was money in this bag when we carried it. - Who picked up the bag? - Who carried the bag? Boss, it was me. And you did not check to ensure that the money is inside. I carried it because it looks like the bag that was shown to us in the picture Tell our man on the bus to stop that bus at all cost. What are you waiting for? Penis. Excuse me. Driver! - Driver! - Driver! Someone is calling you. - Driver! - What is it again? I want to alight. What did you say? - Open the door, let me go down. - There is no bus stop here. Don't tell me rubbish. Are you to tell me where I am going. I said I have gotten to my destination Drop me off. There is no bus stop to drop you off here. Where are you headed? Driver, don't stop for him, don't stop! What do you mean by the driver should not stop for him? Are you the one to tell him where to stop or what is all these? My brother, why do you want to stop by the bush, we are in the bush. You are mad for asking that. Are you to tell me where I'm headed? - Me? - Yes, you. Hey, take it easy. - Thunder will strike you. - Thunder will murder you, idiot! What rubbish, will you tell me what to do? Can you hear me? Drop me off now! - Do not mess with me. - What is all these trouble? Drop me off now! - Drop me! - Hey, young man! Calm down. The driver is just asking you where you are going. Shut up old man and sit there. Shut up! - Me? - Yes, you! Old man, why poke your nose in my business? You are a bastard African. - You have no respect for your elders. - Come on, sit down there! What respect are you looking for? Respect that has gone missing for how long? You are putting your mouth inside. Come on, sit down old man. You do not know anything. Driver! Driver, do not stop for him. Don't stop for him. Reverend sister, you have been cursed. You are mad. Idiot, thief. See, if I hit you once, your life will never remain the same. - Justin a, it's okay. - You must be mad. Ask of me, I have never lost a fight in my career. Driver, stop and let this man alight. Justin a come down. - Driver. - He is a mad man, don't do that with him. - Come. - You want me to come? Okay, very good. - Are you blind? - No, I am not. - Can you hear? - Very well. Was it not inside this bus armed robbers attacked us a moment ago? So, you want them to come attack us again. Okay, are you done? Thank you for your consideration. In fact, okay. Who is this mad person? Don't spoil my seat. Who is this mad man? You all should hold him. Driver! Stop! He should jump out of the window if he can because I am not stopping. Driver, let this monkey join his mates in the bush. I will stop when we get to a crowded place. Stop the vehicle so this guy can get out. Stop this vehicle or are you crazy? What is going on in my bus? Are you all smoking marijuana? - What nonsense is this? - Driver don't stop for him. Reverend sister, I don't know what you are talking about? Let this guy out of here! What is it? Get out! You must be crazy. Who are you? Reverend Sister, if I pull off your cap, reverend would be taken out of your name. Something must be wrong with you. Okay. Driver, why are you holding this guy against his will? What about our own safety? Please ask him. If this driver stops here and something happens to us, all these English you all are speaking will stop. - What will happen to you? - Keep quiet! - Me? I should keep quiet? - Keep quiet. Please, mind the way you talk to me. I am a husband to somebody at home. I have people like you in the house. You have no guts. Driver! Hey, wait! Guys, wait! It's okay. Calm down. Should we vote? - Should we just take a vote? - Yes. If you want this man to drop from this bus, raise your hand. Let this guy get out. My hands are up, even my legs. What are we waiting for?

When did you enter this bus? Please! I don't like rubbish. I am a very respected man. What do you mean and you are interrogating me unnecessarily. I am telling you that is my bag and you are asking me when I entered. I now know you are crazy. It's like you are mad. Are you talking to me? - What kind of person is this? - Hey, driver. Please do not leave my bag on the ground. - Don't forget it. - Mama, don't worry. - Let me deal with this... - You will deal with who? You will deal with who? Like I am your child, right? If I slap you. - You will never remain the same. - Are you mad? Who will you slap? - You! - Do you know I am a titled man? What kind of a titled man are you? I said that is my bag. - Come on shut up! - Children of God. - What do you mean? - Children of God. Stop fighting. Do these ones look like they belong to God? What is the problem, what is going on? Stop it! If you are joking, stop it. What is the problem? It's him. Just imagine this problem. What sort of nonsense is this? - What is it? - What is going on? This morning when I was about leaving Lagos, one woman gave me a bag. She told me to help deliver it to someone at Enugu. Enugu!

You are shameless. - Hold that man. - It's okay. - They don't know me. - Who are you? - But God knows you. - Okay, imagine. Justin a! Can you see that? See what I was saying? When I was saying park and let me alight, the idiot did not stop. Now for me to carry my bag, they are all saying rubbish. But the driver says it is not your bag. He is a thief. Okay wait. Between me and the driver. Please, who are you supposed to believe? Driver! Can you see? - You are just a thief. - It's okay. You this boy. You are an unfortunate person. Mummy, with all due respect. You are a mother and a grandmother. Definitely, your father is unfortunate. Listen. If you are insisting that this is your bag. Why will the driver keep your bag away from you? - Why would he want to do that? - Ask him. Oh my God! At times, you know something that is surprising me. It is very painful when you get senselessness where you expect sense. Daddy, is it until sense is slapped into your head? I will slap you. It's okay, there is now problem. You know what? Put all the bags back in the bus, let's drive to the nearest police station. When we get there, they will sort you out. Yes! You think I am joking with you people? How did he get a knife? Try rubbish with me. You think I am joking. Move idiots! Can you imagine? Idiots! It is me that you are joking with. - Give me the key to the bus. - Don't make this worse. Come close. When I pluck out your eye, we will know who will regret all this. - Key to the car. - Which car man? I mean, the bus key. - It is in the ignition. - Ignition right? Okay, very good. Give me that bag. - Go give me that bag. - That is the bag. It's like you are mad. You are very close to death, you're still very proud. - Carry it, the bag is heavy. - Shut your mouth. Let me look at you. Okay, I have seen the vein. A very good one. Once I cut it, you are dead. Alright, go and get me the bag. Give me the bag. Idiot. You just want to be unfortunate unnecessarily. You think I am joking with you. Join the others. Are you sure you can still drive? What is this? What are you trying to do? Can't you see? I am not asking if you can see mister man, you are about to shoot someone. Wait, are we all okay with this Mallam shooting somebody? Don't kill anybody. I do not want to be involved with the police. - Mallam, please what is your name? - Yinusa. Mr. Yinusa, can you hit that man without killing him? - Yes. - Give it a shot. It hit him! - Look at what he looks like. - His phone. - I will kill you. - No, don't kill him. - Don't kill him yet. - His phone, check his phone. He has been communicating with those people that robbed us earlier. - Get his phone. - Get his phone. - The phone is pass worded. - Where? What is your password? - I cannot disclose that one. - Better tell me your password now. Okay, I will tell him now. - Right away. - Observe. What is it, let me see. Call it. - Call it. - Come on, call it! A, B, Then add container. D, D, U. - D, D, U. - Speak up! D, D, U. So you can talk like a responsible person. The phone is open now. Let me check to see what is happening. I said it. This guy has been an insider feeding those guys intel. - I will break your head. - What are we going to do now? - Guys, we need to go. - Let us kill him. We need to go, let's just leave him here. There is no time. Okay. Well, let us call his family members and tell them where they can find me. What do you mean by family member. God will punish him! In fact, give me the rope, let me tie him well. This is where you will die. It will not be well with all his family members. Excuse me, let me tie him well. - You did not tie him well. - Mummy, tie him well. You looked me in the eye and told me with all due respect. God will deal with my father. Slap him well. Can you see how thunder is striking you now? Let's leave him here. He cannot go anywhere. -Mallam, cut off his ear -No, don't cut it. Cut it so we can go with it as a souvenir. - Let's go, let's get out of here. - Shut up. Let us go. We will leave him inside this bush. You should be happy that they did not kill you. Let us leave here. It is because of me that you were not killed. Sister, let us go. - Go, everybody go! - Let's leave, this guy is crazy. - Leave him and let us go. - The guy is crazy. - Everybody go. - Don't kill him. Thank you. Thank you. Safe journey. Thank you. If you… If you end well... If you end well, okay? You end me here, you… Okay. Go well. The thunder that will strike your vehicle hmm! All of you that voted that the bus be stopped for that boy. You are all out of your minds. Why does that boy want to carry that particular bag? Why didn't you all think about that? What you have said is true. So nobody observed that it was the same type of bag that was taken from this lady the man wanted to take. What exactly is inside the bag? - Let us open the bag. - Leave the bag alone. Hey Driver! This journey has been interrupted twice because of the bag. We have to know what is inside it. - Is it your bag? - Hey driver, relax. We just want to see the bag and know what is inside, that's all. - That's all. - What then happens if the lock spoils? It will not spoil. I can open that bag and the lock will not be damaged. Over to you now. Leave her, let her do her thing. I'm not comfortable with... I'm not comfortable with this. Sister, I am very comfortable. Please hurry up. Do you want me to do it quickly or do it well? Sorry, please continue. Just be fast about it. You are good at this. She is Jackie Chan. Wait, let me help you. This is real Dollars. This is Dollars. How much is in there? It is a lot, can you not see? You know what we will do now… Each of us will share this money. Madam, let go of my hand. What is wrong with you? - Do you want to touch it? - Yes, I want to. There could be some charm in it. - That is true. - There is no charm in it. If you know what is good for you, take your hands away from that money. Hey, I am not talking to you. Let us share this money. What are you talking about? That is how you people die anyhow. Hold on everyone. I hope you all know that travelers can also see us here. So, let us find somewhere quiet to share this money. Wait. You all should not worry. I know one spiritualist. The man is very strong. Before you know it, he will remove any charm. There is nothing wrong with this money. Let us share it already. Let us split it, nothing will happen. You know what we will do now? We should close the bag Put it in the boot before people become suspicious. What do you want to do? Hey, uncle, so we are expected to just follow you? No, come down. Do you want to follow the bag? - If you misbehave, I'll deal with you. - Excuse me. Are you going or staying? I think I should follow the driver, you should stay. If you are going, then I am going. - I have my reasons. - So do I. Alright, get down. - Let's go. - Driver, take it easy. Be quick. Don't worry, I am keeping an eye on them. Nothing will happen. Take it easy. Put it inside by the right. Pastor, better do as you are told. Put it by the right. It is okay there. Let's go. What is wrong? What is happening? What is going on? Come inside, let's go. Driver, give us our transport fare so we can get another bus. What does this mean? Hope you know that anyone one who does not stay on this bus will not have a share of the money. Driver, I am sure you heard my wife. Can you please give her her transport fare so she can go? - What are you doing? - Look, Nneka. I am fighting for your right because I am going with them. What do you mean you are going with them? You are not going anywhere. - Give us our money, let us go. - Nneka, I am going with them! Who is going to look after me and our baby? Did you see that money? We can always make another baby and there are people here that will take care of you. My money. Driver please give her her share of the money. Do you want to leave your pregnant wife because of money? Driver, give me my money. Slyvanus. Madam let me tell you. You married a ritualist and not a husband. Nneka. Don't injure me. Are you mad? You will stay, right? Just hold on. We have driven about twelve thousand from the money. Driver, give me my money. Do you think we are playing? -Driver -I thought you were joking. Just make sure that it is complete. So, you want to leave your pregnant… Farewell madam. This man is not your husband. Go find your husband. - Driver, what is keeping us? - Nneka. This place is dangerous. Our God. Where is your pregnant wife? - Where is your pregnant wife? - Driver! Where is my dollars? Where is my dollars? This world is messed up. What happened? Pastor, what is that thing the bible said? It says, the love of money, it is the root of all… Evil. Do you know the type of evil this man just committed? - What is that? - This man left! He sacrificed his child and wife because of dollars. What is the colour of your problem, must you talk? - Must I talk? - Yes, must you talk? - You should have stayed with your wife. - Exactly! Uncle. See, don't be bothered. Once you make a lot of money, she will forgive you. -Don't worry -Justin a. If we are being honest, you don't even really need her forgiveness. You just have to provide for the family and that's all. And what if she is not after the money? Please, women have the luxury of not bothering about money, okay? Men don't. - Really? - Yes? - Think about it. - Hey! What does that mean? You really can't keep your sexism to yourself. I am not being sexist, okay? I am just stating facts. Excuse me. You, I am talking to you. - What does that mean? - Okay, look. I don't mean to offend anybody. All I am saying is that the society expects the man to take care of the family, to provide. A burden women clearly don't carry. So… You are correct. Because you need money to take care of your wife and children. All you are saying is none of my business. I just want to know how you all intend to spend the money. As for me, this Christmas, I will paint the town red and make sure everyone knows a big man has arrived. Which Christmas? This one? No, two years time. I'm talking this one. The one we are about to experience? Madam, are you deaf? I am talking this Christmas. - That is true. - What is wrong? Because you are foolish. - Me? - There is nothing in your skull. See you. Because you now have some money. You think what is left is to paint the town red. - Is it any of your business? - Be quiet. Don't talk to me anyhow. Reverend Sister, what are you going to do with your own money? - I run an orphanage. - Oh, okay. Young man, what about you? I will buy a house for my mum. Anyway, Aboki, what will you do with your money? Me? Driver! Not all Mallams are Abokis. - Is Aboki an insult? - Yes. How? Okay, with your face looking like the back of a pot. You look like an Aboki. - Are you mad? - You must be crazy. All of you, calm down. Aboki simply means friend in Hausa. Did you hear that? You think you are correct. When you were told that you look like a Mallam or an Aboki, - Why were you angry? - But you also called him a Mallam. Because of what? - Don't you know Mallam is an insult? - How? You don't know? Can you see why I said this man is not smart. You are not smart. A Mallam is a, what do you call... Mister. Mallam is a Mister, right? Even a bad clock is correct twice a day. Who are you calling a bad clock, me? If you are correct, then I can call you Mallam. You must be crazy. With your face looking like the back of the devil's pot. What sort of a person is this? Do you brush your teeth at all? Why are you bathing me with saliva? May the devil bite your butt. You must be mad. Cultist. Please Aboki, do not mind these people. What will you do with your money? Me? Honestly, I will buy a lot of cows. Herdsmen for life! See this one, plenty cows? You think we don't know what your plan is? You want to destroy people's farms with the cows. You have no respect. Can you all see this boy is really crazy? Why are you insulting this gentle Mallam? Do you think all Mallams are bad people? - Stop it! - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Aboki, stab him. Stab him a little. - You must be crazy. - Cultist. I'm sorry. We are men. Police. Come and see. Police. The Police are in front. Police? Where? What are the Police doing here? Police. Everybody, the police are on the road. Driver, don't stop. You are an idiot. Why won't he stop? If you do not stop, they will shoot us. They will shoot us. The woman is right. I think we have to stop. You all should make a decision. Should I stop or not? Reverse, because if they see us and they see that money, they might even kill us. Driver! Stop this vehicle! They will shoot us. - They will shoot. - Driver, stop this vehicle. Officer! Well done officer. Driver, come and open your boot. What is wrong? Why are you angry? Officer, take this. Thank you. Alright, come and open your boot. But I have settled you. Mr. Man, don't waste my time. Open your boot! Move! Madam, get on the bus. - Why? - Get on the bus and relax. - What is happening? - Just get on the bus and relax. - My luggage is in the bus. - I am here, don't panic. Get on the bus and relax. I do not understand this one. I do not understand. Bring down the bags. Bring down this one. - This one? - Yes. Bring down this bag. - This very one. - Yes of course. - This particular bag. - Yes. Come. Where are we going to? I want you to help distract somebody. What is inside this bag? It's clothes that are inside it. Open it and let me see. Officer, why are you interested in this particular bag? Mr. Man, mind your business. Open this bag. I don't have the key. - Officer, I don't have the key. - Don't worry. -Pius -Sir! Officer, what is going on here? Madam, do not provoke me. Respect yourself and open this bag. There are so many bags in this place. You have not told us what you think is in this particular one. - Are you the owner of the bag? - No. Then, why are you asking me stupid questions? Let's get going. Move! Down! Pick the gun. - Get the gun. - Gun? Where is the gun? - Please. - Shut up! I found it. Shut up. Bring it quickly. Please. - Are we good? - Done? See this thing is getting more dangerous. So anyone who wants to back down, now is the time. It's too late for that. Who are you people? Are you students? Yes, we are students. What type of students know how to handle dangerous situations like that? What kind of man slaps somebody into a coma? Answer the question. - What? - Answer I suspect that maybe the man has epilepsy. Okay, I did not do anything to him. I slapped him because he insulted his elder. Okay? Look, you know these policemen, they are not used to being slapped. Maybe the shock triggered his condition. Mister, what do you do? - I am a teacher. - Where do you teach? Where do you teach? Ask them, what is your relationship? What has that got to do with anything? She is my sister. Can he stop asking them questions. Cultist! Stop shouting. Look, we need to protect ourselves at this point. -So, -They could be cultist. - Here. - God! Do you know how to work with it? - Why do you say so? - I mean, look at them. How do… I rebuke you in the name of Jesus! Our weapon for the warfare are not carnal but they are mighty through God. In pulling down every stronghold. What was it you said about not judging the book by the cover? I am judging them based on their appearance. - I don't want it! - Okay. So where did they find all these? They can rob us and attack us at any moment. If they were going to attack us, they would have before we got to that checkpoint. Bring it let me, let me show you. And according to what you said, they have been armed, these people have been armed from the word go - Okay, just be careful please. - We must be careful. No! I don't do guns, I do not do guns. Mister, why are you handling guns to people like chewing gum, what is your problem? It's just a gun for protection. No! - Hold still. - Papa, but it is painful. Be a man. Why do I have to go through this pain? Because you will take over from me when I am gone. Papa, I don't want to become like you, I want to become a teacher. It is also for your protection. What are these charms for? With the right incantation, this charm will take you to wherever you want to go to. - Wherever I want to go? - Yes. With the right incantation. Which I am going to teach you when you grow older and cool headed. Why can't you teach me now? Because it is a costly gift. And must be used carefully. You must only use it when your life is in danger. What is the cost Papa? If you use it too often, you will lose your life. Driver. Please stop the bus, I want to pee. Excuse me Pastor. What does she want this time? Madam, I cannot stop here. What did you say? You cannot stop? Please, I have been holding this pee for too long. Please park and let me pee. Please ma, try hold it some more. Please I cannot stop here. Why didn't you pee when we stopped the other time? Why are you behaving like this? Erm, please. Look, if you do not stop the bus, I will pee on myself and inside the bus. I need to ease myself as well. - What is wrong with you? - Me too. I want to pee. Mister driver please stop, let the ladies ease themselves. I said I cannot stop here. This place is dangerous. Please, as long as that money is in the boot, nowhere is good to stop. But me, I must pee. - You want to pee as well? - Yes. Driver, why are you behaving like this? I don't even know what happened to my bladder. What took you so long? I've been expecting you. Sister. - Come join me. - Thank you. - You don't eat this? - No. You will like it. - I am telling you. - Driver. Why did you use this type of bus for soole? You could have taken it to the motor par and made much money. What do you think? You know… Let me be truthful. Let me tell you the truth. I was sent on an errand with this bus. My boss asked me to use the bus in bringing his in-laws from the East to Lagos. But I will not just go with an empty bus, so I decided to pick up passengers on my way. Do you understand? So, does your boss know that you are doing all this? How? Will you go inform him? So, you thought to make some extra money with the bus. What can a man do? It is December already. December is close by, so… We need to work hard, you get me? Where are these people. Let us leave here already. I did not know that place is like that. What is happening? Get out of the passage way. What sort of person is this? What are you eating? Let me have some. Come! We will leave and leave those people behind. We will share their money. Did you wash your hands? What is wrong with my hand, does it smell? - Will you stop that nonsense now? - What's wrong? Why will you dip the same hand you have used to touch your penis, in my food. Does my penis smell? What is it? I will smack you. - Are you crazy, what is happening? - You are mad. What sort of passenger have I picked up? Guy, why did you throw that away? This guy, I will slap you. You must be crazy. What is wrong with that one? Welcome. Thank you for your patience. I was holding my thing, you people are holding guns. It is a fair fight now. Shit! Please, have you seen that loud woman, the big one? The one wearing a wrapper and blouse. Guy, think. Look, maybe she went to urinate somewhere. Of course, she went to urinate somewhere. Why are you now stressing me? I hope the money is safe. - What's up? - I heard back from Essien. I knew something was up. Oh shit! What happened to you all? Why did you keep me waiting? What is the matter with you? Move it! Fools! - Useless people. - No fucking way. - Oh shit, this is not good. - What happened? -Please -Please, I beg you, don't shoot. Please don't kill me. I was sent on an errand to Enugu. I don't know these people. Please, the money is in the boot. I don't know anything about the money. I don't know who owns the money. I think it belongs to you. Brother, are you a native doctor? They have killed him. Let me explain. I am a Delta boy and I have two little kids. Please don't kill me. What did you do to these guys? - You mean these ones? - Yes. I put them to sleep for a little bit. - How did you do that? - Look, I have no time to explain. Look, Reverend sister, is she dead too? No, the loud one. The big woman, she kidnapped them. What do you mean the big woman kidnapped them? The loud woman in the bus kidnapped them. That's what she does. How do you know she is a kidnapper? I sent her picture to one of my colleagues and he confirmed that she is a kidnapper. You are not making any sense. Since you want a lecture, her name is Isioma Perpetual Nwosu. She is a wanted criminal. Let's report this incidence to the police. Guy, we are the police. Look, the way you guys handled those people, those guns, I know that you guys are not ordinary police. What department of police are you guys? - C.T.U. - What is C.T.U? - Counter Terrorism Unit. Okay? - Exactly, that's what we need. Push, push. Sorry, push. Get back! Push! - Stand up! - Move! Come on! This one is about to deliver, we should inform madam. Now move! Be gentle. - Move! - I can help her. - Move! - I can help her. Shut up! Will you be the first to deliver a baby? Move! Move! Move quickly. Okay. You all should leave. - Leave the road. - Mister, move. Mister hurry and stop walking like you own this place. What rubbish! Go right. Move upstairs. I'm tired of this guy. I don't even understand him. Alright, wait here. Mama. - What happened? - He is one of the passengers. So? Why did you bring him here? - We thought to come show him to you. - Why? Why didn't you kill him? Ma, what sort of question is that? Are you alright? What is wrong with you? I don't have your time. Mama, what should we do with him? Why don't you take him to my bedroom? Goat! Go put him amongst his friends. We will think of what to do with him later. Mister move before I decide to waste you because I am not in the mood for any rubbish. Move faster before I hit you from behind. Mister move, we are going towards this direction. What happened? - What happened, what did you do? - What do you mean by what happened? Why did you mess the operation up? Why did you mess it up? Bimbo was supposed to send the money through a vehicle to another person. I'm not going anywhere, I just want to send this bag to someone. My son, Julius was to tell you where we had gotten to. So that you and your boys can rob everyone in the vehicle. You were supposed to come by yourself. Look for the money and take it by yourself. But what did you do instead, you messed it all up. Move, idiot! Can you imagine? Go, everybody go. Leave him, let us go! You then sent my son. My son, Julius. To rob the bus with one knife. You are stupid. If you have the guts, call me stupid one more time. If you have the guts. Are you crazy? You are mad! What do you mean? You are a bastard. You are a bastard. I will make you blind. I will make you blind. I say you are mad! You are crazy! Who are you? Get away! This way. Excuse me. Tell your madam, that I can help deliver the baby. Reverend Sister. How did they get you? That's a long story. But please, tell me that the money is in this building. How are you still talking about the money? Can't you see the condition that we are in? I can see that. But I also know that no condition is permanent. I am dead serious. I am perfectly capable of being serious. Who is holding the money? We don't know. This is going to be more difficult than I thought. But why are you so fixated on the money? Can't you see that there are people who need our help here? Can you help them without money? Can you? Once you see me move, make sure you follow behind me closely so we can all leave here together. I am not leaving here without these girls. - Which girls? - The ones here. - Did you know them long before? - No! Now, I'm confused. Can't you see they need our help? They have been held captive in here. In this building. And I am not leaving without them. Jesus Christ. I thought you were an atheist. I am not an atheist. He is a pagan. Reverend sister, that is derogatory. I am… You know what, forget it. Plan B. What's plan B? Reverend Sister Do you feel like urinating? What? Can you urinate? Look, I have an escape plan. But it is dependent on the quality of the reverend sister's urine. What?! One of the people in this place has odeshi. What does that mean? It means bullets cannot kill him. Is that possible? I mean… I've heard about it before but I have never seen it. I have seen it. So, If bullets cannot kill him, uncle what makes you think you can kill him. And please, what does that have to do with my urine? How did you do that? I told you, I am a spiritualist. You know what, listen, never mind. Reverend sister, I need you to urinate on this machete. So, I can use it to finish him permanently. I don't feel like urinating. I feel like urinating. Are you sure you don't feel like urinating? Hmm. I don't feel like urinating. And even if I did, I don't go around urinating on spiritual machete. It is not a sp... It is not a spiritual machete, I got it from… I said I feel like urinating. No, it can't be you. It has to be the reverend sister's urine. She can do it. Let her urinate. - It can't be hers, it has to be yours. - Why? Why does it have to be me? It has to be a virgin's urine. Oh I see. But I'm not a virgin. How can you not be a virgin? Why must I be a virgin? Isn't that what this is all about? That's why you are wearing those clothes, you don't have sex. You are a reverend sister. I am not a virgin. I wasn't born a convent. And I was never always a reverend sister. We are all going to die. I'm a virgin. Look, who is a virgin in this place? What kind of expensive joke is that? Who is joking? Our lives are at stake here. I don't have time to be modest. - She said she is a virgin. - Then, I am a Pope. Hey! Excuse me sir. Is it your virginity or mine? Because I don't know why you are debating my virginity with me. What do you have to lose? Just believe her that she is a virgin. What do you have to lose, apart from my life, right? Look, is anybody in this place a virgin? Are there even virgins left in this country? So, you said you can help the girl deliver. Yes, I can. I have experience as a mid-wife. If I let you out, and you plan to escape… I'll kill your friends. I am not her friend. Shut up. I don't plan to escape. I only want to help save the girl. I want the baby. And I want the baby intact. I have a buyer waiting already. And I don't like to disappoint my customers. Do I make myself clear? - Clear. - Good. I will do everything to save the baby. If you try anything funny, I will blow your head off. Slowly, move. Come! Move! If you try anything funny, I will blow your head. You are all I have left. Are you sure you are a virgin? Yes. Okay. Sorry. Alright virgin. Push. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. Drinking water. Take a deep breathe. Oh my God. No! Hey! Shut up. What is wrong with her? She's too young to have a child. What arrant nonsense. Younger girls have delivered with no problem. Her cervix is too tight. She needs a caesarian session. - You will do it. - I'm a mid-wife not a surgeon. And even if I was, what am I expected to use? Don't you have doctors for such emergencies? Which doctor? I have never had such emergency. Did you hear me? This is the first time! You mean to tell me you run a baby factory and you have never planned for such emergencies? I used to have a doctor, but that doctor was arrested when they shut down my operation How am I going to help her and her baby, how? That is your fucking business. Read my lips. Your fucking business! If anything happens to this baby, you and your friends are dead. - Give me yours hands. - What are you doing? I'm doing what I know how to do best. Shut up. Are you talking to me like that? You are on your own. Help me. Somebody should just help me. Hail Mary, hail Mary full of grace. The Lord is with you. How do you do that? Many years of hard work. What do we do now? We wait. Wait for what? For my cue. And what is that? You will know when you hear it. Okay, but when we hear it, what will happen? We'll switch to plan A. I thought plan A was rescuing us. No. That is plan C. I don't understand. Look, plan A, was getting the money. Plan B, was getting a virgin to pee on my machete. Plan C, is rescuing you. Okay. So, the man you plan on using the machete on, he has a gun, right? Yes. Okay. So how exactly do you plan on getting close enough to use the machete on him? - Is that your cue? - No. Yeah, that's it. Who is out there? Which one of you bastards is out there? Oh, it's you. Shit face. You look like the one that cleans madam's butt. You must be mad. What is that? Alright, continue. - Push! - She will push, please be patient! Don't talk to me. Push! I need you to do me a favour, do me a favour. With everything you have, you will push for me. Do me that favour, okay? - I can't. Aunty I am tired. - Yes, you can! Hey! I don't have all the time! - Push! - She will push, be patient! Don't you ever shout at me, okay?! Just push as hard as you can. Do you trust me? Do you trust me? Give her that to bite. In three. One. Push with everything you have, okay? One… One file. Right behind me, quick! My God! Is this what you are doing? When there is trouble all around. Are you shouting at me? Are you raising your voice at me? Remember that I gave you this house and I can take it back if I want to. You will take nothing! Did you hear me? You will take nothing! You better go do what I pay you for. Get to work! Good for nothing. He cannot even impregnate a woman. What is that? Take it. - No! I don't do violence. - Take! Violence has found you. Just spray. Anybody you don't know, just shoot them. - Find the Reverend sister. - Where are you going? I want to go and find the money. Out! Come. Come! Oh my God! What the fuck? This girl is truly a virgin. You have delivered, ehn? - Is it a boy or girl? - It's a boy. - Oh! Give me the baby. - No. - Let's get the baby, let's get the baby. - Come! Be careful. The baby. Run! My friend, where is the money? I went to look for it, I couldn't find it. There were bullets flying everywhere. Where are you going? I am going to look for the money. - You too? - Are you sure about this? Take it easy. Guys, be careful. - Just join them there and sit down. - Go! Easy. Be careful. - Just find somewhere to relax. - Take it easy. Sit. I think we are all accounted for. Right? Except… Where is Mr. Ifebuchi? He's gone. What do you mean, he is gone? - Is he…? - No. He disappeared. With all the money? What? After all these troubles, no money? Look, he tricked us, okay? He used us as a diversion, got to the money and made away with it. Technically, he saved our lives. And with what he can do, he could have left with the money at any time. Guess you are right. Look, can we finally get out of here? No. I'm not leaving here without these girls. Let them follow us. Baba, some of them cannot walk. Girls, if any of you can walk, please go with these people. They are good people and they will get you to safety. The rest of you, stay here with me till the police gets here. - What of us who don't want to leave? - Why wouldn't you want to leave? I came here to make money, some of us did. I don't care. You are leaving this place if you can walk. And if you can't walk, you will sit down and you will wait for the police. Because if this Reverend sister should tell me that you troubled her, I will deal with you. I will come back and I will find you. Did you hear me well? I will stay with the reverend sister. Justin a, no. I don't want to leave you here. We need to go. I'm sorry sir, I had to stop by and get you a Christmas present. What you should be getting me is the first draft of your thesis. Not some bribe you bought from a supermarket. I have that here sir. I'm going to read your thesis and get back to you after the holidays. So, what are your plans for the holiday sir? All these questions you are asking me? Huh, reverend sister. What are you going to do with your own money? I run an orphanage. What will you do with your money? I will buy a lot of cows. Young man, what about you? I will buy a house for my mum. Some of those women have had their children taken away from them. It's one thing for a woman to give up a child of her own volition and it another thing for the child to be taken away from her. So, what makes you think you are qualified to help these women? Erm, sir. I don't know about my qualifications sir. But I do know that I am willing to help. And I have the guidance of sister Veronica here which is why we are here to seek your permission. Well, I must commend you for a very beautiful proposal you have put together. I'm going through it, there is just one thing missing. How do you hope to finance this? Sir, the thing is I have a patron. And when the patron runs out of funds? The Lord will provide. Anybody here? Is this heaven? Jesus. Thank God. Thank you Jesus. My dollars, my dollars have saved me. Thank you God. Where is my key? Where is my bus? My bus isn't here… My key. Subtitle translation by: Adefoluke Adebayo
