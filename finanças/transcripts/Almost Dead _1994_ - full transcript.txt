[EXPLOSION] Thank you. No! Is Jim in? I need to talk to him. -He's with a patient right now. -Well, buzz him. I need to talk to him right now. These feelings that you had, that everyone was out to get you. How far back do you remember having them? [BUZZ] Excuse me. [BUZZ] Yes? RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE): Dr. Schneider, Katherine is here to see you. No, not now. Tell her to come back at 4:00. He says he can't see you right now and come back at 4:00. I'm sorry. Now tell me about these feelings? Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt but, Jim, it's an emergency. I need to talk to you. I'll be right back. What do you think you're doing? I'm right in middle of an appointment. Jim, I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you. I'll go see if that cop is [INAUDIBLE]. This had better be good. I just saw Mother. What? Look, I was having lunch and she was looking at me like she was angry. I tried to follow her but-- It's all right now, Katherine. Now I want you to breathe, slowly and deeply. Feeling yourself calming with every breath, letting your whole body relax. There now, that's better, isn't it? Now, Katherine, I know you think you saw your mother. Jim, she was right there. She was this close to me. There's a very simple explanation for this. And you know what that explanation is. Yeah. Kubler-Ross, the five stages of grief. First stage is denial. And what are you denying? You know what I'm denying. Then say it. That Mother's-- for the past four years I've have been refusing to admit that she's-- -Dead. Don't you think it's time to put this behind you? You don't want to believe that she's dead. Your mind won't let you believe so your brain wants to help out. And it creates a lifelike image of your mother as you would have wanted her to be. It wasn't an image! It didn't look like an image. Of course it didn't. But it was, Katherine. You know that, don't you? -Yes. Are you OK now? I'm fine, thank you. Good. I got to go. [BEEPING] [STATIC] [MEN WHIMPERING] Are you guys all right? Come here, please. David, hi, Katherine Roshak here. Oh, no, I just need to ask you some questions. The usual ones. Say hi to your brother for me. All right, bye. Recent studies have shown a high degree of concordance-- [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Jim, hi. OK, I'll see you then. Bye. Recent studies have shown a high degree of concordance in identical twins in the cases of mental deficiency, um, manic depressive psychosis criminality. Mother. You're not there. You are not there. A lot of primitive cultures practice ancestor worship. Iris, worshipping your ancestors is one thing. But having them come back from the dead? That's quite another. Hey, I wouldn't mind having my grandfather come back. He gave me my first beer and he used to let me look at his girlie magazines. Hey, come on, you guys. That's not funny. -Hi. Jim, I need to talk to you. Katherine, what happened? I saw her again? Your mother? You saw your mother? But, Katherine, your mother is dead. How could you? What did she look like? Katherine. Katherine. Katherine! Katherine, where do you think you're going? I don't know. Look, maybe I'll go to the cemetery where she's buried. Well, you're not being reasonable. Jim, I want to see if her body is still there. You don't think that's being reasonable? Look, you're upset. So why don't you sit down, we'll have a nice dinner and then tomorrow-- Oh, you'll take me down, run some tests on me? Find out what's wrong with me? There is nothing wrong with me, Jim! I saw her! I saw Mother! Katherine, you're acting crazy! Maybe I am going crazy. What do you think, Dr. Schneider? Katherine-- [WHIMPER] [HARMONICA PLAYING] Hello, is anyone here? Can I, uh, help you? Well, it sounds like the coffin just collapsed. I mean, that'll happen in whether like this. I want it opened. I want to see for myself. Just what do you think you're going to see? Grave collapsed, that's no crime. No one was injured. No complaints filed. Then I'll file a complaint. OK. OK. I've got the perfect man to take down your complaint. Dominic! Say hello to the young lady. You're a cop? Dominic Dellasara. It's Detective Dellasara He doesn't mind going up to the cemetery at night. Spends a lot of time up there, don't you, Dominic? KATHERINE: Why were you looking at me like that? You reminded me of someone. Sounded to me like your boss had a problem with you. Nah, no problem. We just don't get along too good, me and him. Must be hard in the small town like this. So you're really a professor, huh? You look kind of young. Assistant professor. Let me guess. Some kind of psychology. Very good, Detective. Abnormal psychology. You don't look like you work around crazy people. I don't. I do research and lectures. But let me tell you something, Professor. There's probably a very simple explanation for all of this. I want the grave opened tonight. Nothing here, Dom. Grave robbers. Probably after her jewelry. There was no jewelry on Mother when she was buried. Well, maybe they thought otherwise. Funny smell down here, Dom. Well, it just needs airing out. Smells like something's burning down there. You're imagining things. All right, guys, let's call it a night, huh? So tell me. Where is her body? There's a lot of crazies out there. So you think some crazies dug up Mother's grave, took out her body, just because they felt like it? Hey, look, you're an educated woman. You're not going to stand here and tell me that you really believe that your mother dug her way out of a grave that she was lying in for four years? No, of course not, Dominic. But I saw her. Look, I'll tell you what. How about you let me take you for a drink? I could use one myself. It's 2:00 in the morning. Where? We'll go to Eddie's. He's a friend of mine. He'll open up the place. Hey, Dom. Eddie. Katherine Roshak, Eddie Herbek. Hi. Hi. Eddie? Oh, yeah. OK. You saw your mother in a restaurant and-- I saw her again. This afternoon I was going over some lecture notes on schizophrenia monozygotic twins. Mono what? Monozygotic. Identical twins-- I've been involved in an ongoing study for a number of years now. You know, it's funny. There's just research subjects, but some of them are better friends than my real friends. Like the D twins. The D twins? They're part of my long term control group. We've never actually met, but I talk to them four times a year. So have they got a name or what? We don't use real names. And it's to protect their privacy. We wind up talking about all sorts of things. It's a research technique. If I want them open up to me, then I have to open up to them first. Hm. So you're doing these lecture notes, your mother shows up again. Anything unusual about the way she looked, her clothing? She was wearing a blue gown. Blue chiffon. The one that she was buried in. Oh, I, uh, I think I'm a little dizzy. Eddie. Who's there? Hey, there Professor. You better get up now. It's about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon. I bet you slept good, though, huh? It's the bed. That mattress is a Beauty Sleep. Top of the line, $700. But my wife says it's worth it. She always wants the best mattress, the best sheets. She says, there's nothing more important in this world than a good night's sleep. She's in the Mayo Clinic right now. She just goes up there once a year for a checkup. Where's Dominic? Uh, I don't know. He might be up at the cemetery. He says it's a quiet place to think. But a lot of people think he's crazy, the way he goes up there all the time. But you're a psychiatrist. Do you think he's crazy? He seems fairly normal to me. You must be hungry. I want to make you breakfast. (SINGING) Keep cool, boy. -Hi. There's your coffee. Thank you. Eddie, tell me, why does he go to the cemetery? It's his wife, Kara. She died about eight months ago. It's a tumor on her spine. For the last two months he went up to her hospital room and he watched her die. And now he goes up to her grave. And he stopped talking to people. Except me-- I mean, I'm almost like his best friend. But, uh, he's got to snap out of. Unresolved grief. He's unable to transfer his emotional needs to another person. Until he does-- Yeah, but he's a good cop. I mean, he had an attitude, but who cared? But ever since Kara, it's like he's looking for an excuse to get fired. And with that asshole boss he's got-- [PHONE RINGING] Excuse me. What? What? OK, I'll tell her. Something happened to your car. You had no business leaving this car here. I'm going to have to repave this whole driveway. Do you have any idea what that's going to cost? Where is Dominic? Dominic? I wouldn't be looking for Dominic to help you. You got a problem? Call your insurance company. And while you're at it, why don't you mention my driveway. So the car just exploded, is that right? That doesn't make any sense. The car wasn't running. It can't just explode. Don't push your luck, lady. Opening that grave was a violation of city ordinances and county health laws and I could arrest you right now if I wanted. I can't believe this. I had every right to do what I did and now you're threatening me? I am doing you a favor. I am letting you off easy, that's what I'm doing. Miller, take Ms. Roshak here down to the station. Put her on the next bus to Los Angeles. You can't do that. Watch me. JIM (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Katherine, it's Jim. Sorry about what happened. Call me. Jim again. Katherine, I was really insensitive. I'd like a chance to make it up to you. Will you please call me? Katherine? Where are you? Hi, Jim, it's me. Um, I just got home. It's kind of a long story so call me and I'll tell you about it. Bye. DOMINIC (ON PHONE): Katherine, are you all right? KATHERINE (ON PHONE): Dominic Mother was here. DOMINIC (ON PHONE): What? KATHERINE (ON PHONE): She set a fire in my bathroom. DOMINIC (ON PHONE): She what? KATHERINE (ON PHONE): Look, they don't believe me. No one believes me. They think I set the fire myself. DOMINIC (ON PHONE): Listen to me. You're in danger. I want you out of that apartment now, do you understand? Everything's going to be all right. Show me. You saw that same message before, didn't you? In another bathroom just like this when your mother committed suicide. No. Why didn't you tell me she committed suicide? Stop it. Why didn't you tell me? Because I never believed it. Mother wouldn't kill herself. She never exhibited any self-destructive tendencies. She's dead, Katherine. You just can't accept that, can you? I don't want to talk about it. I know you don't. The fire stayed right on the surface. It must have been tremendously intense but fast. That's what the arson squad said. Were they able to determine a cause? I told them Mother did it. Get some clothes on. Let's get out of here. Excuse me? I want to show you something. What? Something. Then you ask politely. And then you can tell me what it is you want to show me. And then I'll tell you whether I'm willing to go or not. [KNOCK ON DOOR] JIM: Katherine? Jim? Hi. -Are you all right? What the hell happened here? Professor Roshak believes that this fire was set by her mother. It's insane, Katherine. Well, somebody had to have started it unless you believe in spontaneous combustion. -Who are you? Dominic Dellasara. He's with the Santa Paula police department. This is Dr. James Schneider. This must have been a real shock for you. You need to get away from this place. Katherine, you need a rest. You think I'm crazy? You think I set this fire myself. Let's just take me someplace quiet, secluded, put me under observation, get me all medicated until I become reasonable again? Good idea, Jim. Well, I gotta say, Professor, you are pretty crazy all right. But she didn't start this fire. I'm taking you away from here. Come on, let's go. I don't think so, Jim. You were going to show me something, Detective? Tough. So tell me, Professor, kidding aside, how are you really? I know how the mind works. In cases of extreme bereavement, patients report seeing all kinds of things. But what they see isn't real. In my case it's Mother. And her image seems so real that it feels like I could reach out and touch her. There is one thing I was hoping you'd explain to me though. What's that? How in the hell does an image from my subconscious walk into my apartment and start a fire? It happens at night and in the morning another body is gone. Did you ever see anybody or hear anything? Well, there's 40,000 graves here. The cemetery is two square miles. There's no way you could watch every grave. And all the coffins were empty? That's right. But you know there's one thing I don't get, the relatives that showed up. One time it was the widow and another time it was the son. And they came here before the cemetery notified them. It was like they already knew the grave was empty. They were scared. They were shaken. Like they seen a ghost or something. Those two people who saw, did you know they both committed suicide? Oh, god rest their souls. Hey, Eddie. Hey, Dom. Hey, Katherine. Hey, I like that suit. Uh, listen, I fixed up your room. I got brand new sheets on the bed. Thanks, Eddie. Listen, do you want a night cap? Oh, I don't think so. Not tonight. Let me tell you something about your supernatural manifestations. They followed you all the way here from Los Angeles. Look between those buildings. I don't see anything. Keep watching. There. Stay in the room. Keep the doors locked. You don't open up for anybody except for Eddie or myself. You understand? OK, good. [CRIES OUT] -You're hurt? -It's nothing. -It was Mother. -I don't know that. But I found this. Look familiar? We buried her with this. Couldn't be your mother. She's dead. Dominick, she's out there. You saw her. There was someone out there. I didn't get a clear look. It could have been anyone. It's her rosary. It has to be her. -No, it doesn't. That's impossible. It's been a long day, you should get some rest. You really think I'm going to be able to sleep? I'm going to leave you with something. No. Katherine, it's for your own protection. Take it. All you have to do is pull the trigger like this. You don't even have to aim. You just wait until somebody gets as close as I am to you, and bam! You're in business. I'm going to leave this over there. A gun's not going to work, not against Mother. You're wrong. The gun will stop anything, alive or dead. Maybe I should just check myself in a hospital like Eddie's wife did. Eddie's not married, never has been. He said her name is Phyllis and that she's a beautiful woman. There was a Phyllis around here. She used to work in the bar. Eddie had a crush on her but she ran away with some truck driver. He's a lonely guy. He invents these stories to make himself feel better. Don't worry about Eddie. He's harmless. You keep the door locked. I'll be back in the morning. [BLAST] [THUNDER AND LIGHTENING] [LIQUID POURING] Breakfast is served, Professor. How did you get in here? I had the chain on the door. No, no, no there wasn't any chain on the door. Look, I made you eggs Benedict. The door was locked. I have extra keys for all the rooms, Katherine. I don't mean any harm-- I just wanted to look at you without disturbing. You are very beautiful, Professor, especially when you're sleeping. I could look at you for hours. I think you'd better leave, Eddie. You know, it bothers me to see you with that look on your face. Reminds me of Phyllis. Phyllis used to get scared too. I thought she was so different but she turned out to be just like all the rest. And then she made a fool of me with that truck driver. I mean, right here in this bed! That's when I knew I had to get rid of her. Everybody-- everybody believes that she took off with him out of town. She never left the building. She's still here. You eat your breakfast now, before it gets cold. Hi, Dom. What is it? I put the gun underneath my pillow last night. When I woke up, it was gone. Eddie must have taken it. He was in here while I was sleeping. Eddie wouldn't do that. Eddie is a pathological liar who lives in a fantasy world! Stealing would come perfectly natural to him. Did you look around? Maybe you put it somewhere else. I put it under the pillow. Are you sure about that? That's not all. That woman, Phyllis, she didn't run off. Eddie he killed her, Dominic. He is crazy. What makes you think Eddie killed anybody? He told me he killed her! What did he say? You don't believe me. He's threatening me. Katherine, what did he say? He said she never left the building. I'll be right back. What the hell did you say to her? What was it, Eddie? What did you say to her about the woman who used to work here? Huh? Come on, Eddie! What was it? It was just something I made up. I told her I killed her. I was just kidding. Jesus, Eddie! I-- I-- didn't mean to scare her, Dom. Bullshit! I swear to god. Where's the gun, Eddie? What gun? I don't know anything about any gun. It had better be here when I get back, right where she left it. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. I owe you an apology. Eddie's got more problems than I thought. I want to go back to LA. I can't let you do that. I'm not asking for your permission. Katherine, I'm asking you to stay. If you try and leave I'll stop you. Something's happened and you're not telling me. I got a call from that caretaker of that cemetery in LA. Last night they found the widow of the man whose body was missing. They found her in the cemetery. She'd hanged herself. Police say it was a suicide, just like the other suicides. I don't buy it. Why not? Her husband's body is missing and the shock of seeing him come back to life is-- You saying that those graves are empty because people are coming back from the dead? I don't know about other people. I know about Mother. -Goddammit! The dead don't come back no matter how much you want them to. You want to see the reality of death? I'll show you the reality. I'll show you why your mother will never come back. I like to consider myself a doctor to the dead. When a regular medical doctor finishes his work, that's where mine begins. The only difference, I suppose, is that my patient is deceased. Eye caps. We cement them under the eyelids. This keeps the lids closed and also gives the eyelids that nice, natural shape. Surgical wire. I could use plain old copper wire and nobody would know the difference. Except me, and I like to use quality materials. This little piece of wire is what gives the deceased that peaceful look. We pierce the jawbone, insert the wire, twist it until the jaws come together and the lips meet. The excess wire is then folded between the teeth. Now we drain the body of blood. I shall begin by making an incision at the groin. Then I will insert the injection needle into the artery. This will push the embalming fluid to the heart. And I will insert the drainage instrument into the vein. And now we can start pumping. The blood is forced out of the body and down through these channels here, through this tube, and down the drain. The embalming fluid is then pumped into the body. It can be tinted any shade, you just like mixing paint. It's fascinating, watching the color come back into the deceased, almost as if they were coming back to life. No. It's OK. Ms. Roshak, your mother's body may be missing, but it's filled with formaldehyde. There's no way it could be going on its own. You did the embalming on her mother? No. That was an apprentice, David Effenbeck. He was only here for a short time. One morning he was just gone. The kid was a real artist. That was very effective what you just did. I know that none of this is really happening. It's all just a figment of my imagination. And so is this. Mother was an only child. When she got married she refused to have more than one herself. She said it would be unlucky. What did your father think of that? He divorced her. I mean, I was only three years old at the time. After the divorce he made a fortune in real estate. But he never gave Mother a cent, so she wouldn't let him see me. He died in 1978 in a plane crash. Mother wouldn't let me go to his funeral, wouldn't even let me see his picture in the obituary page. What happened to his money? It was his one chance to get even with her. So he left it all to me. That really must have pissed your mother off. Yeah, I think it's what finally drove her over the edge. You know, always thinking about the money. I remember the day we buried her just like it was yesterday I know it's crazy. I know she can't be alive again. [SIGHS] Would you believe she's dead when I find the body and show it to you? Yes, if you can do that. There's a light in the cemetery. Dominic, I want to go down there. No, I'll check it out, OK? I just want to go-- Let me take you somewhere safe. OK? [DOOR CLOSES] [HEAVY BREATHING SOUNDS] (SCARILY) Yeah, it's me. No one can help. [LAUGHING] [GASPS] Mother. She's here. And she had this wire coming out of her mouth like the undertaker said. It's all right now. She was right behind me. You believe me, don't you? I believe someone was sitting in this seat. It was Mother. There's a way to find out. Look these carbon crystals. It's fascinating, isn't it? Look at this. Those match perfectly. Yes. This is from a sample that Dominic brought me yesterday. It's from your mother's grave. That means that the sample from the pew is the same as the grave site. No, better than that. I can place this sample inside the grave right next to the coffin. Whoever you saw in the church has been down in that grave. But these are just soil samples, right? You see, what we really need is a piece of the body. And that means skin scales. And the place that we're most likely to find skin scales is on a fabric sample. This is your sample from the church. It's from a blue chiffon material. This is what we're really looking for. Now this is a picture of the dust sample that we took from the bottom of the coffin. You see these items right in the middle? These are skin scales. They're from Mother. Yes. Now watch. I think we have a match. Yes, it's a definite match. This is incredible. But I'd be willing to testify in court that whoever Professor Roshak saw in the church has been inside that coffin for the last four years. [SIGHS] Thanks, Johnny. [SIGHS] There's got to be another explanation. You think all that evidence he found isn't real? I didn't say that. Do think that this is all just a figment of my imagination? Hey, I didn't say that. Where are we going? Eddie's. I am not sleeping there. You mean because of Eddie? Eddie's not the one you got to worry about, your mother is. I thought you just said she didn't exist. What I'm saying is, there's someone out there who looks a lot like your mother, OK? You know, you are really starting to piss me off. Now why is that, Professor? Because every bit of evidence we get, you reject it. If you don't have an explanation for it, you pretend that it didn't happen. Why can't you just accept that this is really happening? I'll tell you what. If I see your mother, I'll accept it then, OK? I am still not sleeping there. Fine. We'll get your things. -What's the matter? -Nothing. What's that smell? Katherine. -She was here. -Katherine, calm down. No, Dominic. She was here, what does she want? It's going to be all right. I promise you. You Have a lot of books on the occult, on the devil, on satanism. Do you believe in all of this? If you believe there is a god you must surely believe there is a devil. Father, do you believe that a dead body can rise from the grave? Of course I believe that. The very basis of our faith rests on the Resurrection of Christ. I'm talking about now, Father. Is it possible for the physical body of a dead person to rise from the grave? I think you should tell me what this is about. Katherine believes her mother has risen from the dead. I saw her in Los Angeles last week. Twice. Then I came here to visit her grave but her grave was empty. Your mother's body disappeared. Yes, I know about that. Then I saw her again here in Santa Paula in a church. Are you certain it wasn't hallucination? I'm afraid not, Father. There was conclusive forensic evidence. Something happened tonight, didn't it? We went into Eddie Herbek's to get some of Katherine's things. When we came out there was-- There was a smell in Dominic's car. The outline of her figure was burned into the front seat right where I had been sitting. Katherine, when you saw your mother in church, did you notice any particular smell? Well, there was a stench, a terrible odor, a lot like the one that was in Dominic's car. There was a smell in the grave too. This smell had the odor of sulfur, had it not? What you smell were the fires of hell. The devil is among us. You must be joking. Oh, no, no, no it is the devil himself. He announces his arrival through the stench of hell fire. But it was Mother that I saw. He could create apparitions that appear real. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You mean the devil, like in the Bible? This is no joking matter. Satan is as real as you and I. Now the only way to defeat the devil is to ally yourself with the Lord. Here are scapulars and they will afford you some protection. No, thank you, Father. That's all right. Put it on. Put it on. Don't leave her alone, Dominic. A lonely mind is easy prey for the devil. Goodnight, my children. May god go with you. I'm not sitting there. All right, how about I sit there and you drive? Don't have a lot of people over. My wife was a painter. May I? Go ahead. At the police station you said that I reminded you of someone. It was the last thing she painted. Was this before she was hospitalized? What are you talking about? The painting. Did she do this before she went into the hospital? Kara was never hospitalized. But Eddie said she was. When the tumor was diagnosed, after the x-rays came back, they wanted to put her in a hospital but she didn't want to go. We had an argument and I had to go out. While I was gone she took my gun, put it in her mouth and uh-- Dominic, I'm sorry. I found her when I came back. She was sitting right here. Father Ambrose, he told me that, that she's at peace now. You don't have to do that. Come on, you're my guest. Get me a sponge. Do you realize what time it is? Maybe we should wait until the morning to do this. Well, I want a clean kitchen for when I cook tomorrow. I didn't bring you to cook for me. You're my guest. Look, with all that you've done for me, the least I can do is cook for you. Besides I'll be cooking for myself tomorrow anyway. She looks very happy here. You brought a lot of happiness into her life. You know that, don't you? She looks like she could have been my sister. It must be pretty weird for you when you look at me. When I saw you I thought, I thought she'd come back to life. It's been a long time since I wanted to clean up for anybody. I'm glad you brought me here. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Mr. Dellasara. This is Angelo Brescia. I hope I'm not calling too late. My business you never get sleep. There can be plenty of time for that in the next life. Those three corpses that went missing, I understand you're the man who buried them all. Did you do all the work on the bodies yourself? No, I never cared too much for that part of the business, fixing up the bodies. I had an assistant. He was the best cosmetologist we ever had. You know, people used to comment on how healthy our corpses looked. Then one day he just up and left. That's kind of a coincidence. Same thing happened up here. BRESCIA (ON PHONE): What do you mean? We have a corpse that disappeared. Buried four years ago. That man that did the embalming was named Effenbeck. Effenback? The kid that worked for me was named Effenbeck too. You got anything on him? Driver's license, social security number, anything? No, I paid him cash under the table. It couldn't be the same one. Four years ago my guy was working for me down here full time. As far as I know, one person can't be in two places at one time. Thanks Mr. Brescia. Thanks. What is it? I'm not sure. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Are you expecting someone? Hey, Dom. Hope we didn't wake you. To what do I owe the pleasure? Found someone of yours, Dom. In a dumpster behind Eddie Herbek's bar. Oh, you just happened to be out that way? -Eddie's dead. -How? Shot in the head. Slug came from a 357 Magnum. Ran a ballistics test and guess what? The gun disappeared yesterday. I thought Eddie had taken it. I understand you two had an argument about that. So the gun disappeared, that your story? That is the story. I thought I told you to get out of town. Hope we're not interrupting anything. What are you doing up here? Read him his rights. Dominic Dellasara, I'm arresting you as a material witness in the homicide of Edward Herbek. Come on. That's a bullshit charge and you know it! You screwed up big, Dominic. You and your lady friend. You leave her out of this. Can't. Homicide investigation. Hell, for all I know, that story about her dead mother, that could be a cover in case she decides to plead insanity later. From what I understand it, you're a psychology professor? So that would be right up your alley, wouldn't it? Let's go. You want to arrest me, that's fine. But she can't stay here alone. Why? Are you going to give me those ghost stories again? They're not stories. There's something going on here. I'm fine, Dominic. It'll only be for a few hours. Keep the door locked, OK? [SIZZLING] [SIZZLING] [RINGING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GROWLS] (RASPY VOICE) Kathy, no one can help. [GROWLS] No one except you. No one except you. I'll do anything. (RASPY VOICE) Father's money is evil. Burn it in my grave at the hour of my death and I can rest in peace. [GROWLS] Cooperating with the devil won't save you. All I need is a safe place to sleep, Father. If you do as he ask, you're only putting yourself under his power. You said you had a room. You know what's wrong with the world today? Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody wants to die. I'm really very tired, Father. The room is ready, Father. What about Dominic? Are you going to let him stay in jail after all he's done to help you? As long as he's in jail he's safe. I want to put a stop to all this before any harm comes to him. Goodnight, Father. Wait! You just think I'm a crazy old priest, don't you? You don't believe a word I've said. There'll come a time when you think all hope is gone, Katherine. When the time comes, call on me. No matter how impossible it may seem, I'll be there. I give you my vow was a priest. Wherever you are, I'll hear you. I will, Father. I promise you I will. Ms. Roshak, you're not in some sort of trouble, are you? Because if you are, I think you ought to go to the police. I've already been to the police. I need the money my father left me now. This is a considerable sum of money. Are you absolutely certain that this is what you want? Yes. Now where do I sign? You know, I've never actually seen this much cash. I just deal with numbers in a computer-- nine, 10, 20 million a day. But it's all just numbers. After a while you forget you're dealing with real money. $2,712,892 as you requested. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too, Ms. Roshak. You have a nice day too. You're out of here. Someone make bail? Chief's releasing you on your own recognizance. It was a bullshit charge. He knows you didn't kill Eddie. So how's it feel, being behind bars? Did some thinking, figured out a couple of things. Like what? Like the person that set the fire in Katherine's apartment was no ghost. And the person that stole my gun was no ghost. And the person that killed Eddie was no ghost. No shit. I could have told you that. I've only got one problem though. How is it possible for one person to be in two places at the same time? I'll tell you. It is impossible. Bednarek, that's it. It isn't possible. What in the hell are you talking about? I'll tell you later. Hey, watch out. [SCOFFS] Katherine? Katherine? [GASPS] [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [INAUDIBLE] [SCREAM] Who's that? I don't know. [STRAINING] [MOANING] [WHIMPERS] [YELPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Katherine, your mother's at peace. She doesn't need you now. Father, how can I ever thank you? I've something for you. What is this for? I must go now. Father Ambrose. Father Ambrose? [CACKLING IN THE DISTANCE] EFFENBECK TWIN 1: He was supposed to be in jail. EFFENBECK TWIN 2: What does it matter? No one's going to be looking for us. EFFENBECK TWIN 1: I guess. Not the way we look. [CACKLES] [MOANING] Dominic? [GRUNTS] -Dominic? You OK? Come on now. [GRUNTING] You all right? Yeah. Look, Dominic, we've got to get out of here, OK? What's that smell? Kathy? Oh, Kathy. You are not my mother. My mother is dead! (LAUGHING) She looks just fine to me. [CACKLING] [GRUNTING] [CACKLING] You're the one who embalmed Mother. David Effenbeck. No, I'm David Effenbeck. You're the D twins from the study. You thought you were studying us, but we were studying you. No one can help. No one, Kathy. (TOGETHER) No one. [GASPS] See I still can't believe it happened the way you say it did, Professor. Look, they were twins. What one felt, the other one felt. The pain of the knife, the shock of seeing his brother die, sent him into cardiac arrest. I'm not talking about the twins. What I'm trying to understand is how you got out of the grave? I told you, Father Ambrose dug me out. Now you don't really expect me to believe that, do you? Why don't you go ask him yourself? I can't. He died this morning. See, he was dead a good 12 hours when he was supposed to be digging you out of the grave. He was there, I swear. The letter opener-- if he hadn't given it to me. Whatever you say, Professor. Whatever you say. You believe me, don't you?
