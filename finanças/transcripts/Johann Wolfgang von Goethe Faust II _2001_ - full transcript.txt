Second Part of the Tragedy First act A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE When the blossoms hovering Rain on meadows green and new, All earth’s children feel the spring, Bright with universal dew. Come then, little elfin spirits, All alike to help and bless; Ours to heed no sins or merits But to pity man’s distress. You, round this mortal’s head circling in air, Heal now his heart, in noble elfin fashion: Soothe its fierce conflict and the bitter passion Of self-reproach’s burning darts, make clean His soul of all the horrors it has seen. Four are night’s vigils: now with fair Contentment fill each one immediately. First lay his head where it is soft and cool, Then bathe him in the dew of Lethe: see, His clenched limbs will relax, he will be free, As he gains strength and feels the day before him. Obey the highest elfin rule, And to the sacred light restore him! When a fragrance has descended All about the green-girt plain, Richer air with mist-clouds blended, Evening dusk comes down again; Lulls to infant-sweet reposing, Rocks the heart with whispering sighs, And this wanderer feels it closing On his daylight-weary eyes. Now to night the world surrenders, Sacred love joins star to star; Little sparkles, greater splendours, Glitter near and gleam from far, Glitter in the lake reflecting, Gleam against the clear night sky; Deepest seals of rest protecting Glows the full moon strong and high. Soon the hours have slipped away, Pain and happiness are past; Trust the light of the new day, Feel your sickness will not last! Green the valleys, hillsides swelling, Bushing thick to restful shade, And the fields, their wealth foretelling, Rippling ripe and silver-swayed! Have you wishes without number? Watch the promise of the dawn! Lightly you are wrapped in slumber: Shed this husk and be reborn! Venture boldly; hesitation Is for lesser men-when deeds Are a noble mind’s creation, All his enterprise succeeds. Hear the tempest of the Hours! For to spirit-ears like ours Day makes music at its birth. Hear it! Gates of rock are sundering And the sun-god’s wheels are thundering: See, with noise light shakes the earth! Hear it blare, its trumpets calling, Dazzling eyes and ears appalling, Speechless sound unheard for dread! Quickly, into flowers deep, Into rocks and foliage creep, Hide where elves in silence sleep: Ear it strikes is stricken dead. How strong and pure the pulse of life is beating! Dear earth, this night has left you still unshaken, And at my feet you breathe refreshed; my greeting To you, ethereal dawn! New joys awaken All round me at your bidding: beckoning distance, New-stirring strength, new resolution taken To strive on still towards supreme existence.- A gloaming-shine reveals the reborn world, The forest sings with myriad-voiced insistence, Through vale and dale the morning mists have curled, But heaven’s radiance pierces them, descending, And branch and bough appear, revived, unfurled From the vaporous chasm, their slumber ending; Now deep-down colours grow distinct, as flower And leaf gleam moistly, tremulous pearls suspending. Oh paradise again, oh encircling power! Let me look up!- Each giant summit-height Proclaims already this most solemn hour: They are the first to taste the eternal light, As we shall, when its downward course is ended. Now the green-slanting meadow-slopes are bright Again, each detail new and clear and splendid, And day spreads stepwise with the dark’s downsinking: See, the sun rises! -But my eyes offended Turn away dazzled, from this great sight shrinking. And thus, when with our heart’s whole hope for guide Towards our goal we have struggled on unthinking, And find fulfilment’s portals open wide- From those unfathomed depths a sudden mass Of fire bursts forth, we stand amazed: we tried To set the torch of life alight-alas, A sea of flame engulfs us, ah what flame Of love or hate, burning, consuming us With pain and joy, which strangely seem the same! We look back earthwards, hiding from this blaze Behind a youthful veil of awestruck shame. So be it! I will turn from the sun’s rays. At that rock-riving torrent, with increasing Ecstasy at that waterfall I gaze: From cliff to cliff it pours down never-ceasing, It foams and streams a thousand thousandfold, Spray upon spray high in the air releasing. But from this tumult, marvellous to behold, The rainbow blooms, changing yet ever still; Now vanishing and now drawn clear and bold. How cool the moisture of its scattering spill! I watch a mirror here of man’s whole story, And plain it speaks, ponder it as you will: Our life’s a spectrum-sheen of borrowed glory. AN IMPERIAL PALACE THE THRONE-ROOM Our greetings to you all, most dear And trusty friends from far and near. The sage is at my side, I see; I had a fool too, where is he? Behind your train he tripped and fell Head-over-heels, Sire, on the stair; They lugged the load of guts somewhere- He’s dead or dead drunk, who can tell? And then, Sire, with strange suddenness, Another fool popped up in less Than no time: sumptuous in his dress, And yet grotesque-it quite alarms One at first sight. Your men-at-arms’ Crossed halberds bar him audience. But here he comes, what insolence! What is both cursed and welcome? What Is both desired and chased away? Defended oftener than not, Accused and railed at every day? Who is the uncalled-for comer? Can You name the name all love to hear? What dares approach your throne? What ban Keeps what, self-banished, far from here? Come, spare your speech on this occasion; I’ve riddling and equivocation Enough from councillors like these. Give me some answers, if you please! I fear my old fool’s vanished without trace: You’ll do instead, come up and take his place. A new fool!-Now new troubles begin!- Where’s he from?-How did he get in? The old one fell-Now he’s off sick- He was pot-paunched-This one’s a stick- And so, right trusty friends, we say Welcome to you from near and far. We meet under a favourable star; The heavens presage good luck today. But tell me: in these glad times, when We all cast off our cares again, Put on our carnival masks, and try Merely to take our pleasure, why Must problems of the State torment us? Yet, since you judge them to be so momentous, I gave consent; now give me your reply. About your head, Sire, like a halo, lies One supreme virtue: none can exercise It fully but the Emperor. It is known As Justice!-All men love, desire, demand To have it, all men sorely miss it-and the hand Dispensing it to all is yours alone. But what can wisdom still avail, alas, Or the heart’s goodness or the willing arm, When raging through the realm wild fevers pass, And evils breed from evil’s brood of harm? Look down from this high place, look far and wide Over the empire: it must seem A nightmare of deformity, a dream Of monsters, law to lawless power unfurled, And rooting error spread about the world. One man steals flocks, the next a wife, A third the altar’s treasury: And yet can boast himself scot-free From pains of law to limb or life. While plaintiffs throng the hall, and from His sumptuous seat the judge looks down, Rebellion like a gathering storm Mutters and laps. Must justice drown In these fierce waves? A miscreant Protected by accomplices can vaunt His crimes, while he whom only guiltlessness Defends is pronounced guilty none the less. And thus society falls to pieces, Order and decency decay; How shall men not be led astray As the true guiding instinct stunts and ceases? So in the end good men and true Succumb to bribes and flattery, And judges can impose no penalty For crime, but become criminals too. I have painted a black picture, but I would Draw blacker veils across it if I could. Your Majesty, decisions must be taken. The imperial throne itself is shaken When all inflict, when all endure such harm. Sire, these are wild chaotic days. Deaf to all orders, each man trusts his arm, Every man for himself is slain or slays. The burgher, snug behind his walls, The knight, high on his rocky perch, Vow they’ll survive even though the Empire falls; Their powers leave us in the lurch. Our mercenary soldiers grow Impatient, they demand their pay; But for the money we still owe Them all, they’d all have run away. And we can’t stop them doing as they please; That would stir up real trouble. So The land they should protect, by these Brigands it’s plundered and laid low. We let them rage and eat their fill: Now half the world’s already lost. Some neighbouring kings are allied to us still, But none of them thinks he should share the cost. Who’d boast of allies of that sort! Where are their subsidies, their pledged support? They’re leaking pipes that have run dry. Moreover, Sire, in your domains What has become of property? The new rich, living on their gains, They set up house; they are ubiquitous, And they seek independence. We look on, And what else can we do, having foregone So many rights? What still belongs to us By right? And parties, though they may Call themselves this or that, no one today Can trust them either. They commend And they find fault, but in the end Their love or hate’s turned cold. The Ghibelline Lies low, the Guelph has quit the scene. They’re in hiding, they’re tired of helping neighbours; It’s for himself these days that each man labours. The gates of gold are locked and barred. They’re digging for it, scraping, scratching hard; And our coffers are empty as before. I too have to report calamities. We’re daily trying to economize, And yet we’re daily spending more; Daily my problems are increased. The cooks lack neither fowl nor beast: Wild boar and stags and hares and deer, Turkeys and chickens, geese and ducks- Payments in kind, a steady flux Of rents-all these we get, no problem here; But we are short of wine, I fear. Our cellars, cask on cask, were once replete With finest vintages; but this supply, My lords, since we so endlessly compete In our potations, is drained almost dry. Even the town councils’ stocks are tapped, they swill From bowls and tankards with a will, And feasts end up under the table. As for the wages I’m supposed to pay- The Jew will squeeze as hard as he is able; I get advances from him, years ahead. We buy tomorrow what we eat today, We slaughter pigs while they’re still thin, We pawn the very beds we’re sleeping in; In fact we are living, Sire, on mortgaged bread. Well, fool, do you too have some gloom to shed? By no means, Majesty! Such light shines round us From yourself and those near you! How could doubt confound us Where such a lord wields such authority, Such power to strike down any enemy? Where good will is made strong by wisdom, where A host of hands is busy everywhere, How could misfortune now or ill intent Bring gloom to such a starry firmament! This sly rogue knows-what he’s about- He’ll be well in-till he’s found out- He’s up to something-I guess what- What do you guess?-Some scheme he’s got- Do we not all lack something, of one sort Or another? Here it’s money that’s run short. It does not grow on trees, that’s true, I fear; But from the depths wisdom can bring it here. There is gold in the earth, coined and uncoined, Hoards hidden under walls, rocks precious-veined: This treasure’s for the wise man to collect, By Nature’s power and human intellect. Nature and Intellect! Who dares profess Such dangerous heresy to Christian ears? Atheists have been burnt for less. Nature is sin, the intellect’s ideas Are Satan’s, and between them Doubt is bred, The mongrel offspring of their monstrous bed. Away with them!-The Emperor’s lands are old, And here two native kindreds are alone The worthy guardians of his throne: The men of God, and all our bold And valiant knights. Against the storms of fate They are proof, and their reward is Church and State. There are confused plebeian minds in whom The spirit of revolt finds room: Such men are heretics and sorcerers, The empire’s ruined and the fault is theirs. And you, fool, with your insolent arts, Would smuggle them in here! They are close kin To fools, and quite depraved by sin. We cannot trust such black corrupted hearts. I recognize a learned scholar’s speech! What your hands cannot touch, lies far beyond your reach; None of this solves our problems; I can see No point, sir, in your Lenten homily. If you have not first weighed it; and unless A coin was struck by you, you think it valueless. None of this solves our problems; I can see No point, sir, in your Lenten homily. I’m sick of all this endless hem and hum. We need more money: all right, get us some! I will get what you need, I will get more; The way is easy, though the task is sore. The gold’s already there for us to find, But that’s the art: how shall it be divined? Consider: in those days of terror, when A human flood covered the land, how then So many, here and there, in mortal fear, Secretly hid the treasures they held dear. Such is the custom, now as long ago; Since the Romans were great it has been so. All this lies buried in the Emperor’s ground- And is the Emperor’s property when found. Well, for a fool, that’s not a bad suggestion; The Emperor has these ancient rights, no question. Satan lays golden snares to catch you all! The whole thing’s impious and unnatural. If I could give the court a decent dinner, I’d not mind all that much being a sinner. He’s a sound fool; he knows what’s good for us. As for his methods, soldiers mustn’t fuss. Perhaps you do not trust me? I refer You to this expert: ask the Astrologer! The heaven’s houses he can scan, he can peruse Its hours; come, tell us the celestial news! A pair of rogues-So near the throne- Dreamer and fool-They speak as one- The Wise Man-(here’s a tale we’ve heard!) Talks, and the Fool-prompts every word- The Sun itself, it is pure gold, they say; Mercury runs for favour and for pay As messenger; Venus who charms all men Gleams in the dawn and in the dusk again; The chaste Moon shines inconstantly, and Mars Smites you or threatens you with his fierce wars Jupiter is the fairest light of all; Saturn is great, but seems far off and small. As metal we do not esteem him much, For he is base, though heavy to the touch. But when the Sun and Moon have joined together, Silver to gold-then all the world’s fine weather! When we have them, we can buy all the rest: Palaces, gardens, red cheeks, a plump breast- All this our learned scholar will provide, For he succeeds where no one else has tried. I hear his whole speech twice, but I confess It sounds like nonsense none the less. What’s all this bluff?- It’s stale old stuff- I’ve heard such bosh-Alchemical tosh- And horoscopes - They raise false hopes- He’d be the same - A swindler’s game- They stand around and gape, poor brutes; They doubt my high discovery. They blether about mandrake roots Or the black dog, denouncing sorcery, Showing their wits off; what will that avail When their sure-footed footsteps fail, And when their soles begin to itch With magic that can make them rich! From her profundities do you not sense Great Nature’s timeless power, a living trace Of her mysterious influence, Her deep caress, the touch of her embrace? When all your limbs are twitching so, And you can smell the eerie air- Set to and dig, and hack and hoe: The golden fiddler’s buried there! My foot’s asleep-It’s passed right out- My arm’s like lead-I must have gout- I’ve got an itch in my great toe- My whole back hurts-If we’re to go By these strange signs, this place must be A wondrous buried treasury! Be quick then; you shan’t wriggle out Of it this time, so try your fine words out: Show us these noble places you know well! I’ll lay my sword and sceptre down, If you’re not lying, and my own Imperial hands themselves this work shall crown; If you are lying, then I’ll pack you off to hell! I dare say I could find my own way there. But I must emphasize, this treasure’s everywhere: It’s ownerless, waiting to be discovered. The peasant ploughs his furrow, lifts the soil, And as it turns, a pot of gold’s uncovered; He scrapes saltpetre from his limestone walls And in his startled hand, all shrunk with toil, Finds to his joy a golden purse that falls From some forgotten hollow. And the initiate, What vaults he must blow open underground, What clefts, what passages are to be found, Close to the underworld! He’ll penetrate To spacious cellars, locked of old: There tankards, plates and vessels of pure gold All ranged in rows he will behold; There ruby-decorated goblets stand Ready for use; for close at hand Ancient elixirs still are stored. Though here-you must believe my expert word- The wooden staves have long disintegrated, And yet the tartar crust such wine precipitated Is now its cask Wine’s noble essence too Must hide, as gold and jewels do, Under a cloak of dreadful night. But here the sage works on undaunted: Research is trivialized by too much light, And night, not day, by mysteries is haunted. We want no darkness and no mysteries here; Whatever is of value must appear In daylight. In the dark, thieves slip away, All cows are black and every cat is grey. If there are pots of gold there, take your plough And dig them up into the here and now. You yourself must take tools and excavate; Such peasant labour, Sire, will make you great, And a whole herd will come to birth Of golden calves emerging from the earth. Then with what joy you and your sweetheart may Be instantly adorned with rich array! On glittering stones the colours all will dance, Beauty and majesty alike to enhance. At once, at once then! How long must I wait! Let me entreat you, Sire, to moderate Your fierce impatience till the merry feast Is over! Order serves our purpose best. A penitent restraint first reconciles us, Meriting heaven before earth beguiles us. Who would enjoy good things, let him be good, The pleasure-seeker cool his ardent blood; Who calls for wine, ripe grapes he first must tread; Who’d sup on wonders, let his faith be fed! So let us join in revels and in play! I see tomorrow is Ash Wednesday. Till then, in any case, I bid you all Celebrate a still wilder Carnival! Merit and fortune interweave as one; These fools don’t know it. If they ever were To find the famous Philosophic Stone, They’d have a stone but no philosopher. A spacious hall Forget you are in German lands, forget Dances of Death, of fools and devilry: These shall not mar our pleasant revelry! Our noble Emperor, when he set His course for Rome, and crossed the Alpine heights, Conquered, for his advantages and your delights, A southern realm of gaiety. There, at the Holy Father’s stool, He humbly stooped and claimed the right to rule; A crown was what he went to ask, But with the crown he brought us back the mask. Now all are reborn in this garb of jest, And every worldly man of us is glad To pull it round his ears and head, To look a clown and to be antic-mad, Though under it he’s sane like all the rest. I see already how they gather And part, and fondly come together, Chorus with chorus as they meet and mix, As in and out and out and in they go. Here we shall learn what we already know: That with its hundred thousand foolish tricks The world was always a great fool, and still is so. Siamo belle Florentine: All our finery we’ve brought For we would be signorine Worthy of the German court. Many flowers we are wearing On our dark and curly heads, Silken flakes and silken threads In their composition sharing, And their making is a special Skill, deservedly renowned: Though their beauty’s artificial, It will blossom all year round. Many colours, tiny pieces, All arranged in symmetry; Each one variously pleases, But the whole is harmony. Siamo belle giardiniere, And with men we’re not contrary: For in every woman’s heart Nature is akin to art. Baskets on your heads and arms, Richly loaded, match your charms; Show your wares! Let all make haste, Each to buy what suits his taste, That a garden may appear, Paths and arbours all be here, Maidens and their merchandise Crowd into a paradise! Fruit and flower wage no strife; I need envy none of these, Buyers shall be plainly told What they’ll pay and what they’re sold. Fruit and flower wage no strife; I need envy none of these, It is not my way of life. I, the strength of lands and fields, Am their guarantee of peace By my steady annual yields. Let us hope that I shall now Decorate some noble brow. We are gifts the Earth Goddess sent: Add us to your jewellery! This most craved utility Also charms as ornament. Many-coloured mallows rising Strangely from the mossy ground! We are Fashion’s own devising, Though in Nature seldom found I am nameless, I was missed Out of Theophrastus’ list; Yet I hope to enrapture you, If not all, at least a few. Who will twine me in her hair Lovingly to adorn her there? Who will raise me to her breast, Grant me there so sweet to rest? Let such motley fancies flower For the fashion of the hour; Strangest structures be invented, Though by Nature not intended! Stems of green and cups of gold In those tresses all behold- But we grow unseen, unbidden, And when rosebuds first ablaze Hint at early summer days You may find us, fresh and hidden; Such a pleasure who would miss? Promise and fulfilment: this Law in Flora’s kingdom binds Every eye, all hearts and minds. The Gardeners: Flowers that seem to bloom and grow On your heads their beauties show; Fruit with living flesh and juices Only for itself seduces. We, the sun-burnt workers, sell you Cherries, king plums, blushing peaches: Buy them! for your eyes will tell you Less than tongue or palate teaches. Come, this fruit is ripe and sweet; Taste, for it is good to eat! Poems to a rose are written, But an apple must be bitten. Let us join your pretty labours; Richest youth is youth that shares! We’ll display our mellow wares In abundance, as good neighbours. Arbours decked and garlands wound, Bowers blithe and convolute: All at once may here be found, Bud and petals, flower and fruit. Mother and daughter: When you were but a mite, my lass, I put you in a bonnet; Your figure and your little face Were pretty as a sonnet. Even then I saw you as a bride With a rich husband by your side- I set my heart upon it. Ah well; now many a year’s gone by, Wasted and dissipated. The wooers come, but off they fly, And none of them has waited; And yet you danced and did your best, With nod and nudge your interest Was clearly indicated. At all our parties, what went wrong We never could discover- Forfeits and Third Man all night long, And all was vain endeavour! But on a crazy night like this, Open your legs now, little miss, And you’ll soon catch a lover. They are joined by a number of pretty young playmates, and all the girls begin gossiping intimately together Fishermen and bird-catchers with nets, rods, lime twigs, and other equipment enter and mix with the pretty girls. Charming dialogues develop as they all by turns try to woo and capture and escape and hold on to each other. The Hewers of wood: Make way! A clearing! Space for us, please! We’re felling trees; The timber crashes; The load we’re bearing Bumps and bashes. You must understand We want praise and esteem: For if none in the land Were hard of hand, Where would they be, The cream of the cream, For all their wit? They’d freeze, if we Didn’t sweat, you see; That’s the nub of it. Punchinellos, performing clumsily, almost inanely: You poor stupid hacks Born with bent backs! We are the sly ones, The work-shy ones. Dunce-caps sit lightly, Our garb is flimsy; We can be sprightly, Live by our whimsy, Leisurely skippers In comfy slippers. Through street and square, Through crowds we go; We stand and stare, We shriek and crow To call each other, Like eels we slither Right through the throng, And dance together The mad day long. Parasites, eagerly fawning: Whether you praise us or criticize us, You stout log-bearers You are our heroes! Would not our bowing, Nodding and scraping, Flattersome phrasing, Hot and cold blowing That bends to fancies And suits pretences, Be unavailing - Though we were given Supplies unfailing Of fire from heaven. If logs were lacking, No charcoal setting The wide hearth blazing, The hot flames cracking? There the food’s basted And seethed and roasted; The patroned picker, The true plate-licker, Smells fish and meats, And comes to table Eager and able For gastric feats. Now I’ll have a jolly day, Nothing getting in my way! Look at what I’ve brought along: High good cheer, a merry song. So I’ll drink! I’m drinking, drinking: Come, drink with me, clink-a-clinking! You back there, come join the fun! Lift your elbows and it’s done! My good wife turns up her nose, Scolds me for these motley clothes, Doesn’t find my antics funny, Tells me I’m a costume-dummy. But I drink! I’m drinking, drinking: Drink, my hearties, clink-a-clinking! All you dummies, this is fun! Fill your glasses and it’s done! If I’m lost, why, then I’ve strayed To a most convenient spot: Credit from mine host, if not From his wife or from the maid. So I still am drinking, drinking; Come on, you lot, clink-a-clinking, Each to each! So on it goes; Now we’re all drunk, I suppose. Be such revels where they may, Let it always end this way! Let me lie now where I’m lying; I can’t stand, it’s no use trying. Brothers, let’s be drinking, drinking! Raise a toast, a-clinking clinking! This one’s ended on the floor: Keep your seats or there’ll be more. Poets of various kinds: nature poets, bards of chivalry and court life, tender minstrels and rhapsodists. In this throng of miscellaneous competitors none succeeds in making himself heard. One of them slinks past, uttering a few words. If I might do the very thing To give my poet’s soul some cheer, I would write and speak and sing What no one wants to hear. The Night and Graveyard poets send their apologies, explaining that they are in the middle of a highly interesting discussion with a freshly resurrected vampire, from which a new poetic genre may perhaps be developed The Herald has to excuse them, and in the meantime summons up Greek mythology which loses none of its character and charm even in modern costume. The Three Graces: Aglaia: If you would learn graceful living, Mingle grace with all your giving. Hegemone: To accept with grace be skilled, When sweet wishes are fulfilled. Euphrosyne: And from quiet sheltered days Learn to thank in graceful ways. The Three Fates: Atropos: As the eldest, I am bidden Now to spin the thread of fate. Many meanings here lie hidden, Much for me to meditate. Finest flax your lives has woven, Soft and supple it must be, Ever slender, smooth and even; Leave such skilful work to me. But reflect: though bold your dances, Rank the pleasures you may take, Towards its end this thread advances; So beware, for it may break. Clotho: Things have changed: in recent years I have held the fateful shears. She is old, and by her action With them caused dissatisfaction. Useless lives dragged out their story, Lingered on in light and breath, But the hopes of youth and glory She cut short by gloomy death. Yet I too, I’m bound to say, Made mistakes in my own day, So my shears are sheathed for surety In the interests of security. And I welcome this restraint On such festival occasions; Watching you, I am content To prolong your celebrations. Lachesis: As the wise one of the three, Fate’s disposal fell to me; Ever-even distribution By my reel’s perpetual motion. Threads appear and threads are wound, And they never miss their way: Each I guide where it is bound, It must circle as I say. And my vigilance must never Lapse, or all the world’s disjointed. Years are measured, hours are counted; Twisted skein goes to the weaver. Now here come ladies you’ll not know by sight, However well you’ve read the ancient books; They’ve done great harm-but judge them by their looks, And they’ll be guests you’re eager to invite. They are the Furies-you’ll not credit this, Seeing them so attractive, young and kind; But get to know them better, and you’ll find How sharp as snakes these pretty doves can hiss. Yet though they are malignant, nowadays The foolish vogue’s to boast of one’s defects; So they’ll not pose as angels to win praise, But own that they are ruin’s architects. Alecto: Try as you will, you’ll trust us in the end; We’re pretty pussies and good flatterers. If one of you has got a little friend, We’ll pour caressing poison in his ears Till he believes us when we tell him straight That she’s come-hithering so and so as well, That she’s lame, hunchbacked, or an addlepate- In fact, that he’ll be marrying trash. We tell Similar stories to the bride: we say, For instance, that her friend, the other day, Spoke to that other girl, or some such slight. They may be reconciled, but never quite. Megaera: That’s a mere trifle; once she is his wife My work begins. Their happiness I can Destroy with mere ill humour. Human life Is various, various are the hours of man. The lover may embrace what he desires, But longs at once for something still more sweet; Poor fool! He quits the joy of which he tires, Seeks to warm ice, flees the sun’s ardent heat. All this well suits the tricks I have in mind. My faithful demon Asmodeus stands by, We scatter well-timed mischief, he and I; Thus, pair by pair, we ruin all mankind. Tisiphone: Death, not merely tittle-tattle, Is my vengeance on the traitor! Knife or poison, soon or later Comes the adulterer’s requital. Moments of sweet love must all Turn to froth and turn to gall; Here no special plea assuages, Guilt must pay its utmost wages. Let none sing ‘Forgive, forgive!’ ‘Justice!’ to the rocks I cry; ‘Shall the fickle-hearted live?’ And they echo: ‘He shall die!’ Now move aside, make way, if you don’t mind: Something is coming that is not your kind. A mountainous beast approaches, if you please, Its flanks bedecked with gorgeous tapestries; Two tusks, a snake-like trunk hang from its head; Mysterious! But such riddles can be read. High on its back you see a slender beauty sit, With a slim wand she guides and governs it. Up there, too, stands another, ringed with light And splendour-I am dazzled by the sight. In chains two women walk, of noble mien, One at each side, one fearful, one serene: One wishing, and one feeling herself free. Let each state her identity! Reeking torch and lamp and light Glimmer through this feast’s confusion; Among faces of illusion I am bound, alas, so tight! Foolish jokers thronging round me, Grinning false seductive smiles! All my enemies surround me On this night of treacherous wiles. This man was my friend: I see Through him now and his disguise. That man tried to murder me, Now he flees from my sharp eyes. Why can I not get away From the world? Yet I must stay: Doom that hangs above my head Holds me here in murk and dread. Greetings, sisters! You have spent These two days in merriment, In a pleasant masquerade; But tomorrow you’ll prefer, I am sure, to be displayed As yourselves. Indeed, we care Little for this torchlight scene; We would wander our own ways On the sunny summer days, Freely through the meadows green, Single or companioned, choosing To be active or reposing. Lacking nothing, free of care, All we seek is granted there; Every one a welcome guest, We may enter where we please, Seeking happiness with ease, Sure of finding what is best. Let not Fear or Hope infect you! See, I bring them chained and bound; Thus-stand back, make way all round!- From these scourges I protect you. This great living lump of power, On his back he bears a tower. On he plods with steps enchanted, Uphill, downhill, nothing daunted. But above his turret’s wall Stands a goddess with swift wings Wide outspread; for so she brings Ready benefit to all. Glorious brightnesses surround her, Flashing far and all around her, And her name is Victory, Goddess of all activity. Ho, ho! It seems I’m just in time To curse the lot of you! But I’m Particularly keen to sneer At Lady Victory up here. With her white flapping wings she may Well think herself a bird of prey, And as she gazes down so grand, Fancy she’s queen of all the land. But where there’s honour and success, They raise my hackles, I confess. I’d lift what’s low, put down what’s high, Make wry things straight and straight things wry: That’s the one thing that comforts me, That’s how I want the world to be! Why then, my sacred staff, you low-Born cur, shall strike a master-blow!- Now writhe and squirm! Now you’re in trouble!- Ugh! Now that back-and-front dwarf-double Shrinks to a dirty clod of earth, Then to an egg; just fancy that! It swells to bursting and gives birth To twins: a viper and a bat Hatch out of it! One slithers back Into the dust; the other, black As night, flits to the roof. Somewhere Outside, this ill-intentioned pair Will meet; I’d rather not be there. Come, there’s dancing, music’s playing!- I don’t like this, I’m not staying- This is creepy; don’t you feel Spells being woven? It’s not real- Something’s whirring round my head- There, you see, my foot feels dead- We’re not really hurt at all- We’re just scared to death, that’s all- I call this a rotten joke- It’s those swine, the trickster-folk. I have done, since I was made Herald of the Masquerade, Duty at each feast as sentry: Nothing harmful must gain entry To our place of celebration, And I stand firm at my station. Yet through windows, I admit, Airy phantoms seem to flit; There are ghosts and magic here Which I can’t keep out, I fear. First, that spooky dwarf; and now A whole flood of it somehow. As my office bids, I should Give you an interpretation Of these shapes; I wish I could! They defy all explanation. Pray assist my ignorance! See, Through the crowd-how can this be?- Floats a splendid chariot, drawn By four steeds, easily borne Through their midst; they need not part Or give way. What wizard’s art Does it?-Far-off glittering Stars in many colours rise, Flickering, magic-lanternwise. What is this storm-snorting thing? Now I’m scared! Make way now! Whoa-ah! Check your wings, my horses; so! Feel the wonted reins you know; Rule yourselves as now I rule you, Leap like fire when so I school you- Let us pause and pay respect To this place. Look, they collect Round us, the admiring crowd. Herald, come; proclaim out loud, While we’re with you, who we are, What we’re like, etcetera. Since we’re allegorical, You, I think, should know us all. To describe you I might try; But that’s not to identify. Try it, then! First, I must concede You’re a young, handsome, halfling boy; Women must hope to have more joy Of you when you are fully grown. Indeed, You are a future lady’s man, I’d say, A born seducer anyway. You are most kind; but pray continue. Have you this riddle’s pleasant answer in you? A jewelled ribbon beautifies Your night-black hair above dark flashing eyes. And from your shoulders to your feet, how fine A garment flows, with gems ashine And edged with purple! Some might say You’re like a girl; and yet, even today, For better or for worse, you’d make a good Impression on the girls-they would, I’m sure, teach you your ABC. And this resplendent figure, who is he, Who on the chariot’s throne sits royally? A prince he seems, rich and a generous giver: Lucky are those who know his favour. To gain their wish they cannot fail; To scan all needs his eyes avail, And giving is his purest pleasure, Greater than fortune or than treasure. Good, but that’s only half your task: A full description’s what I ask. Such dignity no words can praise. A moon-shaped visage bright with health, Full lips, red cheeks, a sun-like gaze Beneath his jewelled turban’s wealth; A rich commodious robe. What shall I say of his demeanour? All The world must know him as a king! Plutus, the god of riches (for That is his name) in triumph here I bring; He is badly needed by the Emperor. But tell us now your own identity. I am Profusion, I am Poetry, The poet who perfects himself the more He spends from his most precious store. I too am rich like Plutus, and I hold Myself his peer in wealth untold. I enliven his feasts, adorn his dances: Where his provision lacks, there mine enhances. To boast with charm’s your proper part, But let us also see your art. I’ll snap my fingers then; see how lights play And flicker round the chariot straight away! Here’s a pearl necklace-out it jumps; and here Are clasps of gold for neck and ear; And combs, of course, and diadems, And gold rings set with priceless gems. Sometimes I offer flames as well Where they may kindle, who can tell! Now watch it snatch, the foolish mob! Even the giver’s having a hard job. He snaps out trinkets left and right; It’s like a dream, and they all fight And grab for them. But what new tricks Are these? One catches something, picks It up, and what, for all his pains, Is the reward? Nothing remains! The string of pearls has vanished, and Black beetles scuttle in his hand. He casts them down, and now instead They’re buzzing round his silly head. And all the rest are fooled likewise, With monstrous moths their empty prize. The rogue! He promised them a lot, And now fool’s gold is all they’ve got. It seems your herald’s role is to proclaim The hollow mask, but not to name The true reality that lies behind; That is beyond your shallow courtly mind. But we’ll not quarrel here. To you, my master, I Shall turn, and you will make reply. Did you not give me my four steeds, This chariot with its whirlwind speeds? Do I not drive as you command me, There in an instant where you send me? And did I not triumphantly Win you the palm of victory? How often I have fought your wars, And every time the day was yours! The laurel that adorns your brow, I wove it, for my mind and hands knew how. You are, as I will gladly testify, Spirit of my spirit, acting ever as I Would wish; your wealth exceeds my own. Acknowledging your service, let me bear Witness that this green laurel bough I wear Is precious to me like no other crown. This word I speak to all, and it is true: Beloved son, I am well pleased in you. Look, now I have distributed My greatest gifts: on many a head A flame that spurted from my hand Now flickers. Fiery tongues dance round, Pausing on each of them in turn: To one they cling, the next they spurn, But seldom does the fire blaze high In brilliant bloom that soon will die; Few even recognize the spark Before it fails and all is dark. Who’s that up there behind, asquat The luggage-box? I bet he’s not The genuine article. A clown, But hunger and thirst have thinned him down; We’ve never seen clowns that weren’t fat. Try pinching him, he’ll not feel that! Disgusting females, let me be! I know you have no use for me. Once, Home and Woman meant the same, And Avaritia was my name; Those were the days! Good luck about The house; lots in and nothing out. My coffers were well stocked with gold- I was a mortal sin, we’re told. But in more recent years, this passion For saving’s not been woman’s fashion: Like all bad payers, she has more Wishes than ducats. It’s a sore Plight for her husband, he’s beset On every side by ruinous debt. Her spinning-money she’ll soon spend On clothes and on her fancy friend; She dines and wines with every sort Of squire who comes to pay her court. So I set greater store by gold, being wiser, And now my masculine name is Miser. Miserly dragon! Let him stick To his own kind. It’s just a trick To turn our men against us, though That’s hardly needful, as we know. You old straw guy! Old skin and bone! How dare he threaten us? Come on, Give him a slap! That ugly frown Won’t frighten us. Let’s pull him down! The dragons are just wood and paper! My staff calls order! Stop this caper!- But my help’s scarcely needed now. Look at those fearsome monsters, how Quickly they clear a space, and spread Their double wings, their claws of dread! Those scaly dragon-snouts, fire-spitting, Chatter with rage. The crowd’s retreating; It scatters. Now there’s room. How like a king He has dismounted! At his beckoning The dragons set to work: the chest Is lifted off at his behest, Brought to him, set down at his feet, With gold and miser, all complete. Now this is a miraculous thing. You have laid down your heavy burden here; Now you are free to fly to your own sphere, For here it is not. Here we are surrounded By grotesque motley shapes, wild and confounded.. Only where you gaze clear into sweet clarity, Trusting yourself alone, there you should be: Where you are yours, the beautiful and the good Alone can please. There make your world-in solitude! As your true envoy I esteem myself; so too I love you as my next of kin. Where you Dwell, there is fullness; and wherever I May be, there all I bless and gratify. Confused by life, men often hesitate Whether to serve you, or commit their fate To me. Your followers of course enjoy A life of ease, but mine must constantly employ Their energies. My deeds I cannot hide: If I but breathe I am identified. Farewell then, since you grant my happiness: I go, But I’ll return when you shall whisper so. Now it is time to set the treasure free. To strike the locks I take the herald’s stave; And they fly open. In bronze vessels, see! The golden lifeblood stirs, a seething wave, And jewellery-rings and chains, a crown- Which soon the metal flood will swallow and melt down. Oh look, oh look, it’s overspilling! Right to the edge the chest is filling!- See how they melt, the cups of gold, See how the rolls of coin are rolled!- The ducats dance as if new-struck; Oh joyful sight, oh great good luck!- I watch my dearest wish come true! They’re spinning on the ground now too- This is your chance, now use it quick, Stoop to be rich, and take your pick!- Our lot’s the strongest, we’re the best, We’ll carry off the treasure-chest.- You fools, it’s just a masquerade! What are you doing? That’s enough Greed for one evening. Did you think this stuff Was gold and money? I’m afraid You louts don’t even qualify For gaming-counters in this game. A pleasant fancy: you think that’s the same As the coarse truth? And indeed, why Should you know truth? You wildly snatch At any dull illusion you can catch. Oh mask of Plutus, lord of mummery, Scatter this rabble mob for me! For that, no doubt, your staff is fit, If I may briefly borrow it!- I’ll dip it in the soup of gold.- Now, mummers, have a care! Behold It flash and splash and spark and spit! Soon it’s red-hot, see how it glows! Now anyone who comes too close Will be unmercifully singed. Stand clear! I must pace out a circle here. Oh! Oh! We’re done for! Runaway!- Every man for himself, I say!- You there behind, get back, make way!- It’s spurting in my face, it’s hot!- I’m crushed by the burning stick he’s got!- Stand back, you mummer-mob, stand back!- Make room, make room, you senseless pack!- Now we’re all lost, now we’ll all die!- Oh, give me wings, and off I’d fly!- The encircling crowd must now retire; They seem to have escaped the fire. The mob takes fright, They’re put to flight. But I must draw an unseen border To guarantee this new-found order. A splendid work you now fulfil, Thanks to your power and your skill. We must be patient, noble friend; This tumult’s not yet at an end. Now if we please, we may survey This charming circle: once again, As always, women take the forefront when Some sweetmeat tempts or something’s on display. My rusting-up’s not yet complete, A female beauty’s still a treat. So off I’ll go and court some ladies; And I’m in luck today-it’s gratis. But with such crowds of people here, Not every word is heard by every ear; So I will use my arts, and mimically express My meaning; this should bring me some success. Hands, feet and gestures here are insufficient: But in a ruder jest I’ll be proficient. My clay shall be this malleable gold, For it’s a metal apt to every mould. Our walking skeleton, what’s he up to now? Has hunger made him humorous somehow? He’s kneading all that gold like dough; Between his hands it softens so. He squeezes it: a lump, a ball Shaped like no proper thing at all. He shows it to the women: they All shriek and try to run away, Making a great show of disgust. The rogue shows malice in his lust: The more he outrages decency, I fear, the better pleased he’ll be. This must not pass! Give me my stave! I’ll drive him out, I’ll teach him to behave. But now another threat draws near! Leave him his antics; he has no idea What’s coming. There’ll be no room for his fooling; Law rules, but force majeure is overruling. The Wild Host comes from the high hills, Out of the wooded glens it spills: Who can withstand us now, who can Resist? We honour our Great Pan. A secret known to none we know; The circle’s empty, in we go! I know you well, and your Great Pan. Good speed Together you have made. I know indeed. That secret known to few; respectfully I loose the circle’s narrow boundary.- Now may good fortune still pursue them! The strangest things may happen to them; They cannot tell where now they tread, For they have failed to look ahead. You dressed-up mob, parading vainly! We come here bare, we come ungainly; See how we run and leap so far, How rough and rude and strong we are! Now fauns advance In merry dance; In curly hair Oak-leaves we wear, Among our locks each pointed ear Pricks up so neatly here and here, Our nose is blunt, our face is broad: All these are things that women applaud. A girl will dance and be delighted When by a faun’s paw she’s invited. Up pops the satyr now, complete With scrawny haunches and goat’s feet; They must be lean and sinewy, For like a mountain chamois, he Delights in rocky heights to see The world. Refreshed in freedom’s air, He mocks all humankind from there: Deep in their valleys’ steamy stew They fancy they are living too, But high above all taint and throng Those regions to him alone belong. Here come the Little Folk, trip-trot; Not two by two, we’d rather not. In moss-green smocks, with lamps aglow, We helter-skelter to and fro, Each of us doing his own thing, Like glow-worms swarming, glimmering, Scuttling busily about, Hither and thither, in and out. Dwarves are like us, they’re our close kin. Rock surgery we specialize in: We bleed the lofty mountains’ veins, And out pours treasure for our pains. We pile up metals we have struck, With miners’ greetings wishing luck. All this is thoroughly well meant; Good men deserve our good intent. But we bring gold up so that they May steal and whore, for that’s their way; With iron weapons we supply The proud man for whom thousands die. The three thou shalt nots men ignore Soon have them flouting many more. All this is not our fault, and you Must still have patience, as we do. Here are the Wild Men, that’s our name, The Wild Men of Harz Mountains fame. Natural-naked in full strength, Each with his club a pine tree’s length,. We come as giants big and tall And thickly girdled one and all With leaves and branches bound like thatch. No Pope has bodyguards to match! Great Pan is here! In him is shown, In him alone, The great world’s sphere. You happy nymphs, surround him now, Flitting and dancing round him now; He’s serious but benevolent And a friend of merriment. And he’d be wakeful all day too Under the heaven’s tent of blue, But by the breezes he’s caressed And streamlets murmur him to rest. And when he is asleep at noon No leaf or twig will stir too soon; Life-giving plants are growing there, Their fragrance fills the soundless air; No nymph dare stay awake, we fall Asleep still standing. But his call, His sudden cry of fearful power, When it rings out in that same hour Like thunder or the roaring sea, Then none knows where to stand or flee, Brave armies quail, the hero quakes Hearing such tumult as Pan wakes. So let us praise this lord who brought Us here, and hail him as we ought! Though the glinting treasures thread Richly through the mountain’s heart, Only the diviner’s art To that labyrinth is led. Troglodytically living In dark caves we hide away: Yours the gold for gracious giving In the purer airs of day. Now this other spring divined Most conveniently close by Will miraculously supply All we scarcely hoped to find. You can bring this to completion: Take it, lord, and care for it; Any wealth in your possession Is the whole world’s benefit. We must be high in spirit, we must face With resignation what will now take place; And indeed you are valiant, as I know. All will deny, even posterity Will disbelieve this dire calamity, But in your written record it must show. The Dwarves, with Great Pan following, Approach with care the fiery spring; It boils up from its source, and then Sinks down into the depths again; Now dark it stands, the open jaw, Till glowing broth spews out once more. Great Pan, whom this strange toy amazes, In high good humour stands and gazes, As pearly foam from each side blazes. Shall he believe his eyes? And low He stoops, to see if it is so. But his beard drops into the vat!- Whose beard? And whose bare chin is that? His hand conceals it. Now, alas! A great misfortune comes to pass: The beard bursts into flames, blows back, Wreath, head and breast the flames attack, And our rejoicing turns to grief. All rush to quench, to bring relief, But none escapes the leaping fire; The more they smack and smite, the higher The inferno rages. An entire. Tangle of masqueraders, wrapped In flames, by burning death are trapped.. But what is this report I hear, From mouth to mouth, from ear to ear? Oh ever wretched fatal night That brings us to this dreadful plight! What none can bear to hear or say Will be proclaimed this coming day; And now from loud cries I am learning: ‘It was the Emperor who was burning!’ Oh if it only were not true! He burns, and his attendants too. That cursed rout seduced his mind And came with resinous twigs entwined To bellow their wild song: now all Into this general ruin fall. Oh youth, youth, can you not constrain Your joy into its purer measures? Oh majesty, will you never reign All-powerful, yet with prudent pleasures? And now the arbours are alight; The pointed tongues lick upwards, right Into the coffered ceiling. Why, We’ll all be burnt now, we’ll all die! Alas, I fear it will be so. Who’ll save us from this general woe? One night, and the imperial state Lies burnt to ash and desolate. Come now, that’s enough alarm! You shall all be saved from harm. With our staff now strike the ground, Let its sacred power resound. Let the wide air at our will Now with cooling fragrance fill. Come, you trails of drifting, sliding Mist, enveloping and hiding All this fiery chaos; curl, Fleecy cloudlets, trickle, swirl, Breathe your vapours, gently gliding! You can quench, you can assuage, You can damp this false fire’s rage: Do so, and it all shall seem But the summer lightning’s gleam.- Thus, when spirit-power assails us, Magic’s ancient art avails us. PLEASURE-GARDEN Sire, for the pyrotechnics we apologize. It was most entertaining; pray devise Such sport more often! Suddenly it seemed That I was Pluto, and a great sphere gleamed And burned about me. A dark rocky pit Glowed as with fiery coals, and from the depths of it And of the other, blazed wild flickering flame Of many thousand tongues, which all became A single vault, a supreme temple: higher It rose, forming, unforming out of fire. Whole peoples moved through the vast colonnade All round me that the twisting flame-tongues made: They thronged towards me, circling far and near, And all, as hitherto, paid homage here. I recognized my court among these wonders; I was prince of a thousand salamanders. And so you are, Sire, for the elements All recognize your high pre-eminence. The submission of fire you have seen first; Plunge now into the sea at its wild worst, And scarcely will you touch the pearl-strewn floor Than a great dome will shape itself once more: The mobile waves, light green and purple-fringed, Into a kingly dwelling shall be changed Round you, its central point. Go where you please, Each step you take, you take your palaces Along with you. That globe’s live walls will swarm With flickering things all darting to and fro; Sea-monsters, nuzzling at its strange mild glow, Approach, but none can pierce the magic form; Gold-squamous coloured dragons play, the wide- Jawed shark lunges: you mock him, safe inside. Your thronging court here takes delight in you, But such a throng as that you never knew. Nor are you there debarred from sweetest wishes: For curious Nereids (young and keen as fishes Yet shy, or older and more circumspect) Swim up, your deep-sea lodging to inspect In its eternal lustre; Thetis too will wed This modern Peleus and take him to her bed. Next, high Olympus and the kingdoms there- One mounts that throne quite soon enough, we’re told. And, Sire, the earth you already have and hold. What lucky chance has brought you here, straight out Of the Arabian Nights? You need not doubt, If you can match Scheherazade’s skill In story-telling, that I will Grant you high favour. Let me count on you When the day’s doings bore me, as they often do. Your Majesty! I never would have thought I’d one day bring the news I now have brought Of such good fortune to you! Here I bow Before you with such joy! For how Can it be true? The bills are paid, The usurers’ rage has been allayed And from their hellish claws I’m free! Can heaven offer such felicity? The army debt has been half settled, The oath resworn, the troops refettled, Their mercenary morale restored, Landlords all rich, the men all whored. How light of heart you both seem now, The wrinkles vanished from your brow, A quicker step, and cast-off cares! Sire, you must ask these two, the work was theirs. It is the Chancellor’s office to explain. I am glad not to have lived so long in vain! Hear then and see this fateful paper, which Has changed our poverty and made us rich. ‘To whom it may concern: hereby be advised and told, The present note is worth a thousand crowns in gold. This sum secured and covered in full measure By Imperial land’s abundant buried treasure; The same to serve as its equivalent Upon recovery, as is Our intent.’ My lords, this is some fraud, some vast deceit! Who dared to sign my name in counterfeit? Has no one yet been punished for this crime? You wrote it, Sire, yourself; at Carnival time, Last night! You were Great Pan, you will recall; The Chancellor approached, as did we all, Beseeching you: ‘A few strokes of your pen Will crown the feast and mend the realm again!’ You signed: and thanks to prestidigitation The night sufficed for ample duplication. And in this general boon, to ensure fair play, We printed the whole series straight away: Tens, thirties, fifties, hundreds-all are ready. See how the people all rejoice already! This town, half mouldy-dead of late, now thriving, Swarming with life, its appetites reviving! Your name has blessed the world for many a year, But never was so gladly read as here. The remaining alphabet grows valueless, For in this sign all now find happiness. My people think it’s gold? Well now, that’s funny. The court, the army, treat this as sound money? Astonishing. But now what can I do? No one could catch them, and away they flew; It spread like lightning. Now on every side The money-changers’ doors are open wide; They’re honouring every note, both small and large, With gold and silver, though of course they charge Commission. Butchers, bakers, landlords-good Money for them! Half the world just wants food And drink, the rest want fine new clothes to strut About in; tailors stitch, cloth-merchants cut; Meanwhile plates clatter, meats are stewed and roasted In taverns, and ‘The Emperor!’ is toasted. Walk then alone along the terraces: See, a fair lady all in fineries, Covering one eye with her proud peacock fan, Come-hithering with the other any man Who bears this paper passport to her heart, Which outpersuades all wit and wooer’s art! No need to lug a purse around; the best Place for such billets is a lover’s breast, Among his billets doux. A priest may carry Them piously inside his breviary; As for the soldier, he’s a nimbler fighter, I dare say, if his money-belt is lighter. Forgive me, Majesty, if I trivialize By such examples our high enterprise. he abundance of treasure buried deep Under your lands lies frozen and asleep Until we waken it. Thought’s utmost scope Sets a mean limit to such wealth; the hope Of fancy in its highest flight must fail, Try as it may, to tell so rich a tale. Yet worthier spirits whom deep insights bless Place trust unbounded in this boundlessness. Such paper currency, replacing gold And pearls, is most convenient: you can hold A known amount, no sale or bartering Is needed to enjoy love, wine, or anything You please. And there are banks to sell you coin; If not, then temporarily you join The diggers, sell a golden chain or cup, And thus the paper debt’s at once paid up And all the mocking sceptics put to shame. Everyone’s used to this, they want the same System continued; thus the Empire far and wide With jewels, gold, and paper now is well supplied. The Empire owes great benefits to you, And a commensurate reward is due. We entrust you with the ground in all our lands; To guard that wealth, yours are the worthiest hands. You know where we must dig, and at your word We shall recover this great hidden hoard. As partners now, joint masters of our treasure, Fulfil your honourable task with pleasure! For here two worlds to union are invited, Upper with lower happily united. Sire, there shall be no strife and no divisions; I like to have colleagues who are magicians. ow for some gifts; but you must each confess What use you intend to make of my largesse. I’ll have high life, song, dance and jollity. I’ll go and buy my sweetheart jewellery. From now on I’ll drink wine at twice the price. My fingers itch already for the dice! I’ll pay the debts off now on my estates. I’ll watch my fund as it accumulates. I hoped it would inspire you to new deeds. But it’s easy to guess your well-known needs; It’s obvious that however rich you grow, Whatever you have been you’ll still be so. Is this a bounty? Shall I get a bit? So you’re back! You’ll just live by drinking it. They’re magic papers! What do the words say? You’ll misread and misuse them anyway. - There are some more that dropped-what shall I do? - Just take them, it’s a windfall, they’re for you. Five thousand crowns! You mean all this is mine? - So you rose from the dead, you two-legged bag of wine? - I often do, but this time’s the best yet. You’re so pleased now, you’re breaking out in sweat. - But look, is this worth money? - It will buy all your big maw and belly want; just try! - You mean a house, livestock and farming land? - Of course! Just offer, they will understand. A castle, hunting forests, fishing streams? I'll soon address you as ‘my lord’, it seems. Oh luxury! Ill be a squire this very night! Call him a wise fool now, and you’ll be right! A DARK GALLERY These gloomy passages! Why do you drag me here? Was all that high society Not fun enough? There’s plenty of good cheer Still to enjoy, and much fine trickery! No need to speak of it; in the old days You played that game a hundred tedious ways. Now stop your slithering to and fro And tell me what I need to know. They’re pestering me now for action: The Steward, the Chamberlain want satisfaction. The Emperor demands to see Helen and Paris, here, immediately; The ideal man and woman, to appear Before his eyes, in figures plain and clear. So get to work! I mustn’t break my word. You promised that? How frivolous, how absurd! Let me inform you that your pranks Have consequences, my good friend. We made him rich and earned his thanks, And now he must be entertained. You think this task’s a simple one; But it’s a steeper stair to climb, A stranger region than you’ve ever known, Which by your new commitments you now dare To tread, conjuring Helen out of time Like phantom paper-money from the air. Easy, you think?-Witches I can supply, Ghost-goblins, changelings, curious succubi; But Satan-sweethearts, though quite charming in their way, Can’t pass for Homer’s heroines even today. So, here we go again, your old lament! With you there’s never any guarantee; Nothing gets done without an extra fee, Everything is a problem you invent. She’ll come at once, as I know very well! Two mumbled words from you will summon her. Pagans are not my period, sir; They’re lodged in their own special hell. - But there’s a way. - Divulge it instantly! I do not like to; this is high mystery. Enthroned in solitude are goddesses- No place, no space around them, time still less; I mention them with some uneasiness. They are the Mothers. Mothers! You dread the name? The Mothers! But how strange ‘the mothers’ sounds! Indeed; we hesitate ourselves to speak Of these great goddesses, and your mortal minds Have never known them. Go to the depths to seek Their dwelling! If we need them, you’re to blame. Which is the way? No way! A path untrodden Which none may tread; a way to the forbidden, The unmoved, the inexorable. Make preparation! There’ll be no locks to unlock, no bolts to slide: On solitudes you will drift far and wide. Do you know solitude and desolation? If these are your wise saws, you might as well Not speak. They’ve a witch-kitchen smell; This is all stuff from long ago. The world was with me, was it not? And there I learnt and taught nothing but empty air. If ever I talked sense, told what I know, They’d shout me down still louder; finally, Embracing desert solitude to flee From the vile tricks society played on me, Rather than have no company at all I invoked the Devil, as you will recall. Yet even if you’d swum the ocean through And known its boundlessness, even then You would see waves roll by and roll again; Even at the dreadful drowning-point, there too You would see something. In the still sea-green There would be darting dolphins to be seen; There’d be the clouds, sun, moon and starry sky- But in the eternal void you’ll say goodbye To sight, not hear the step that steps so far, Not rest a foot on where you are. You talk like any ancient mystagogue Addressing neophytes with words to fog Their simple minds; but here per contra. I Am sent into your void to magnify My art and strength there; I am to cat’s-paw Your chestnuts from the fire. Come then! let’s claw The meaning out of this. I hope to see Your Nothing turn to Everything for me. My compliments, sir, as you take your leave; You know the Devil well, I do believe. Now take this key. That little thing! First seize It firmly, and respect it, if you please. It grows in my hand! It shines, it’s all a-glitter! Perhaps you now appreciate it better. Follow it downwards, for this key can read The hidden map: to the Mothers it will lead. The Mothers! Every time it strikes such fear Into my heart, this word I dare not hear. Are you so limited, that a new word Disturbs you, merely one you’ve not yet heard? Let nothing trouble you in sound or sense: By now you should be used to strange events. Yet must I turn to stone? Not so I'll thrive! Our sense of awe’s what keeps us most alive. The world chokes human feeling more and more, But deep dread still can move us to the core. Descend then! I could say ascend; there’s no Distinction. Flee from all that has been born Like drifting coils of cloud they will approach you: Brandish the key, for then they cannot touch you. I seize it, and at once my spirits rise, I feel new strength for this great enterprise. A glowing tripod will alert your fall That it has reached the deepest depth of all. And by that tripod’s light you’ll see the Mothers; Some sitting, as the case may be, and others Who stand or walk. Formation, transformation, The eternal Mind’s eternal delectation. You’ll pass unseen: the whole world of creatures swarms As images round them; they see empty forms And nothing else. But you will be in great Peril still, and you must be bold: go straight To the tripod, touch it with the key. Just so! Then, slave-like, it will follow where you go; Good fortune’s wings will raise you, never fear! Before they miss it, you’ll be back up here. And once you’ve got that brazier, then you may Summon the famous pair into the day. No one has ever dared before to do This deed, and it will be achieved by you. The incense-cloud, with magic to compel it, Will assume any godlike shape you tell it. Well then, what now? Strive downwards; stamp, and you Will sink; you’ll rise again by stamping too. I hope he’s well protected by that key. Will he get back, I wonder? We shall see. You still owe us that spirit scene; you’re late With it. The Emperor doesn’t like to wait. He’s just been asking us when it’s to be. Delay’s an insult to His Majesty. My colleague’s gone to see to it; he knows how It must be done, he’s working on that now, With silent labour and peculiar skill. This occult task’s not easy to fulfil. Beauty’s like buried treasure: where it lies Is known by art and magic to the wise. What arts you use is your affair; just hurry! The Emperor wants to see the show start, that’s our worry. BRIGHTLY LIT HALLS A word with you, sir! My complexion’s clear, But every summer horrid spots appear- Hundreds of them, red-brown; it’s such a pest, Covering my white skin! Can you suggest A remedy? For shame! A bright young thing, Marked like a panther-kitten every spring! Take frogspawn, toads’ tongues, mix, distil them well In the full moonlight to complete the spell; Wait till the moon wanes, then apply with care, And when May comes, the spots will not be there. Look how these flatterers mob you, sir! I, beg A remedy too. It’s for my foot, my leg: It’s frozen! I can’t move it properly, To walk or dance or curtsey. Allow me To give your foot a footprint of mine too. Well, that’s a thing that courting couples do. My foot, child, has a more important function. All ills are cured by like to like’s conjunction; Thus, foot heals foot, and so with other parts. Come now, keep steady! Don’t reciprocate! Oh! Oh! You stamped so hard on me! It hurts! That was a horse’s hoof! At any rate, My dear, you’re cured. From now on you’ll be able To dance, and play foot-footsie games at table. Let me through! Let me through! I’m in such anguish; Deep in my heart I boil and burn and languish. I was his sweetheart only yesterday: Now he walks out with her, tells me to go away! That’s a problem; but now do as I say. Take this charcoal: steal up close to your man And mark him with it where you can - His sleeve, his cloak, his shoulder-and at once He’ll feel a prick of loving penitence; But swallow the coal immediately, don’t take A drop of wine or water. That will make Him sigh this very night before your door. I hope it’s not a poison? If you please, Show due respect! The flames around a stake Charred this rare relic; bonfires such as these Were commoner in days of yore. - I’m in love, but they say I’m still not old enough. - I’m at my wit’s end, answering all this stuff. The pursuit of young girls will certainly frustrate you. Try older ladies, they’ll appreciate you. More cases to be dealt with! I don’t know Which way to turn. In such a situation One has to tell the truth, in desperation. Oh, Mothers, Mothers, help me! Let Faust go! THE GREAT HALL But already the lights are burning low; The whole court is assembling for the show. In seemly sequence they advance down long Passages, through far galleries, and throng Into the great hall-such a crowd its old And noble space can scarcely hold. Its walls are rich with tapestry displays, And knightly armour stands in nooks and bays. I think no magic words are needed here; Now of their own accord the spirits will appear. My task was always to announce a play: Now, spirit-antics complicate the thing. Their secret tricks I can’t explain away By common sense; it’s most bewildering. The thrones and chairs are all in readiness; Facing the wall, the Emperor takes his place; Depicted on its surface he can see Old battle-scenes very commodiously. So here they sit, lords, ladies of the court; Behind, on benches, are the commoner sort, And for this ghostly show, amid the huddle, Sweetheart and sweetheart find a place to cuddle. Thus, all are seated, all’s in order here, We are prepared: the spirits may appear! Then let our drama start at once. By high Command, let the walls open, mastered by A ready magic! See, the hangings furl Away, as if they were on fire; the whole Wall splits, turns inside out; now I ascend To the proscenium, as a deep stage Appears before us by some sortilege, And glimmering light mysteriously is feigned. From here I hope to please the general taste; As a prompter the Devil is well placed. You know the starry motions in and out; You’ll understand my whisperings, I don’t doubt. By magic power now before our eyes We see a massive temple-structure rise; and as old Atlas carried heaven, so These many pillars stand in stalwart row, Ample to bear a mass of rock so great; Two alone would support a building’s weight. So that’s the antique style! Well, to my mind It’s most ungainly, lumpish, unrefined. They call such coarseness grand and noble! Where Are our slim columns striving through the air, Our pointed arch that lifts the spirit high? Such edifices truly edify. Welcome with reverence this star-favoured hour! Reason, be bound by verbal magic’s power! And boldly, splendidly, from far and wide, Let Fancy come here and be satisfied. What you have dared to crave, your eyes now see; Believe it quia impossibile. In priestly robes and wreath, a miracle-man Comes to complete the great work he began. A tripod rises from the depths with him, A whiff of incense from the brazier’s rim; His lofty task he now will crown and bless; All will be well, all points to happiness. In your name, oh great Mothers, you whose throne Is boundlessness: eternally alone You dwell, and yet in company! Round the head Of each of you, life’s forms float, live yet dead; What once has been, what once shone gloriously, Still stirs there, seeking evermore to be. Your mighty power divides it; day’s bright tent Receives it, or the night’s dark firmament. Some images are merged with life’s sweet flow, And some the bold magician captures: so With prodigal confidence he satisfies Our wish, and brings wonders before our eyes. His glowing key touches the bowl, and all At once a misty vapour fills the hall. Cloud-like it creeps and shapes itself, extended, Compacted, parted, criss-crossed, double-ended. Now for a masterstroke of spirit-art! These moving clouds make music, touch the heart With airy tones, some je ne sais quoi of sound, And all is melody as they drift around. They set the columns and the triglyphs ringing: I do believe the entire temple’s singing. The mist subsides: from it, as if to dance, We see a beautiful young man advance. The lovely Paris-but I’ll say no more; He needs no introduction here, I’m sure. - Oh radiant youth, in fullest flower so sweet! - How like a peach, juicy and fresh to eat! - His lips how delicate, yet full and pink! - A shapely cup; wouldn’t you like to drink! - He’s pretty, in a slightly vulgar way. - Not quite enough deportment, I would say. I recognize the shepherd-boy, that’s clear, But not the prince; not one of us, I fear. Oh, he’s half-naked, looks all very well, But let him put on armour, then we’d tell. - Now he sits down; how softly, with what grace! - You’d find his lap a pleasant resting-place? - How gently on his arm he rests his head! - The lout! Such postures are prohibited! - Why must you men find fault perpetually? - To loll and sprawl before his Majesty! - It’s just his act, he can’t see us or you. - This is the Court; plays must be courteous too. - A gentle sleep envelops the dear creature. - And now he snores; entirely true to nature. What can that fragrance in the incense be That moves my heart, that so refreshes me? Indeed, it penetrates the soul, this breath That comes from him! It is the bloom, the growth Within him: the whole atmosphere is filled With this boy’s youth ambrosially distilled. So that’s her! Pretty, but not what I’d call Exciting; she’s just not my type at all. I must admit it in all honesty: Though I had tongues of fire, here there would be No more for me to do than say: Behold, Now beauty comes! As poets sang of old, The sight of beauty maddens; to possess It is good luck in dangerous excess. Have I still eyes? Has beauty’s fountain-head Itself flooded my inmost mind? So blest Is my reward after that fearful quest! How empty all the world was, closed and dead To me until this priestly revelation Founded it fast, a timeless, loved creation! May life’s breath fail me, if habituation Shall ever wean me back from you again!- What magic mirror was it long ago, What fair shape that bewitched me so? What vision now, what vaporous fantasm then!- To you I pledge my strength, my whole desire, Passion’s quintessence, all the fire, The idolatry, the madness of my heart. Compose yourself, keep calm, stick to your part! - She’s tall, well-made; why is her head not bigger? - How coarse her feet are! They don’t match her figure. She’s just like many a princess I know; I think her beautiful from top to toe. Gently she steals towards the sleeping lad. Spoiling his youthful purity; it’s too bad! - Now in her beauty’s rays he seems to bask. - Endymion and Luna, need one ask! Exactly so! And now the goddess stoops Down to him, drinks the breath upon his lips; - A kiss!-Ah, enviable consummation! - In public! This is an abomination! Shall that boy be so favoured? Let them be! Ghosts will be ghosts-respect their liberty! - She tiptoes from him; now he is awake. - But she looks back at him, make no mistake. - He is amazed, he can’t believe his eyes. - Amazed! Not she; for her it’s no surprise. How modestly she turns to him again! Oh yes, she’ll educate him now with care. What fools they are in such a case, these men! No doubt he thinks he is the first one there. - Come, let’s not carp. What majesty, what grace! - The common slut! Just look! It’s a disgrace! What would I give now to be in his place! - The man she can’t ensnare’s not yet been born. - The pretty jewel’s been so often worn, Even the gilding’s getting less like gold. - She started it at only ten years old. We must be opportunists; I’d not say No to the good things others throw away. I see her plain, but I must say I feel A little doubtful whether she is real. To say she’s here could be exaggeration; The text is what I go by, the narration In which I read that all Troy’s greybeards fell Head over heels in love with her as well. This proves the point, I think; for I’m not active And young, and yet I find her most attractive. Now he’s a boy no more! A hero’s arms Boldly embrace her scarce-resisting charms; With sudden strength he lifts her-seems to bear Her off, indeed- Rash fool! How does he dare? Stop! Can’t you hear me? I must intervene! But it’s all in your mind, the mad spooky scene! After all this, I’ve one more thing to say: The Rape of Helen’s what I’d call the play. Rape! Do I count for nothing here? My hand Still holds this key, this key that was my guide Through all the solitudes, through ocean-wide Chaos, and brought me back again to land! Here I set foot, here are realities, From here the spirit wars with spirits, here is The joining of the two great sovereignties. Far as she was, how nearer can she be! I’ll rescue her, and she’ll belong to me Twice over! Mothers, Mothers, grant this boon! Who that has known her lets her go so soon! Faust! Faust! What are you doing?- By main force He has seized her, and her shape grows dim, of course. He turns his key against the young man-No!- It touches him!-We’re done for now! Oh! Oh! So there, you see! Take up with fools, and you’ll Regret it; even the Devil learns that rule. Subtitling by knappen. Translation by David Luke.
