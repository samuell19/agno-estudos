(Multicom Jingle) (dramatic music) (window squeaking) (razor scratching) (nail file grinding) (zipper buzzing) (upbeat music) (crowd talking) - [Woman] You could do it, get your client to come out. - [Man] I'll make room. - So, all is forgiven, Coco? - Of course, how could I not? - We really mustn't fight that way. - Let's promise that we don't. And seal it with a dip. (Ruth giggling) - When a Coe scores with them all, amazing isn't it? - Oh, Coco, it's been ages since I felt so alive. Who are all these people? I wanna meet everyone that's important to you. - Oh, there's only you, only you. Come on, I'll introduce you to the big boss Mr. Brody. Now he only appears to be crude and cunning. Deep down he is a lamb. Wonderful party, Mr. Brody. - Introduce us to your date, Kevin. - Harvey, this is Ruth, my mother. - Do you think I was too much tonight? - No. - Oh I was, I know. But I know what this world is like. You have to stand out from it just to be noticed. Most of those people didn't like me, but they won't forget me or you, and it's you I don't want them to forget. - Oh, don't worry mother, I won't let them. - We're a good team, aren't we? - Hey, of course we are. Listen, mother bear, in a year, maybe less, we'll be in L.A.. I talked to John about the disco idea and he is falling over to get it started. All I need is a few more selling months like this one. Did I tell you 5,500 in commissions? I listed three properties just yesterday. Two of them, cash only deals. No one's gonna out volume me, no one. (chuckling) - Oh Ret. Ret, darling, it's a brand new day, Tara is saved. Oh, my goodness. (humming) (Ruth giggling) Going somewhere? - Ah, did you two have fun? - [Ruth] It's Jennifer, isn't it? - Jennifer, mother, Jennifer's in Las Vegas. I have a date. - At this hour? - It was fine, Gordo. I met Kay Lauren there. I didn't know she was into real estate. Her husband works for you, right? - She has to sell real estate. Her husband doesn't make enough money in the newspaper business. God, it's stifling in here. - Yes, he did work for me. He transferred to the morning paper. - [Newsman] Reject the proposed orders. Another rape attempt was reported in Hamblen Park earlier today. The woman managed to escape, but was unable to describe her assailant. - I can't bear it. It's unconscionable that in today's society the tragedy of rape continues to proliferate unchecked. Why must women suffer this terrible violation? - Oh, the woman apparently got away, Ruth. - Others haven't been so lucky. Oh, I know you'd never publish a word about rape and sully the Christian image of Spokane, but some madman is on the loose out there and every woman in South Hill knows it. - I'm sure the police are-- - Just drop it! Let's just drop it. Go on. Go on to your secret date. When will I ever be free of the Coe men? But be here for breakfast. I'm making your favorite. (car engine rumbling) (light dramatic music) - Jay. Don't let them fold over, take them right to the car. - Remember when we found that lost dog and kept it in your basement for three weeks before your mother knew, when we were nine? I wonder why I'm thinking of that now. - Kevin, you're home. What a nice surprise. Nice to see you too, Jay. - Hi, mother, your hair looks nice. - Thank you, I didn't go to the hair dresser. Did I spoil something? - No, Jay was helping me take some stuff to the cleaners. - You actually think I don't know what's going on? You've been running over there for months. Has that tart finally convinced you to move in? - I better get going. - And you, you helped bring her back to Spokane and get them back together. - It's what Kevin wants, Mrs. Coe. - Kevin has no idea what he wants. Now, would you please leave my home. - Gladly. - How can you do that to him? Jay is my best friend. - How can I do that? You're pathetic. Don't you even know what you've done. - I'm trying to live my life. - Then go live it, but not with that bitch. An occasional whore woulda been a far better choice. - Jennifer's in Las Vegas I just-- - Don't you dare lie to me. I've seen you with her. - You followed me? - Yes, I followed you. $400 suits, you can't afford them, you don't have the money. Your father gives it to you. I know. I know everything. Now get the hell out of my house and remember if you go running back to that tramp you are not my son. (door slamming) - [Dispatch] Criminal mischief at 883. (muffled radio talking) (Lois crying) - Get this off me, these are dirty. I can't have dirty clothes, get them off of me. - Okay, we'll do that. Lois, I'm sorry to have to put you through this, but I need you to tell me everything you can remember, every detail. (Lois crying) - Please just hold me. - Flashlight over here. - Hold me. (muffled police radio) - Before he ran off he patted her on her bare buttocks and said be more careful next time, like he was giving her friendly advice. I know I don't have good visual id's, Lieutenant Donner, but I do know the M.O.'s are similar, I think there's a pattern here, like maybe a serial rapist. - Liz-- - And I don't wanna have to tell her mother and dad that manpower shortages are slowing down the investigation of their daughter's rape. (knocking on door) - [Matt] You wanted to see me? - Uh yeah, this um, this rape thing, it's a, I agree with Liz here, it's getting out of control and I want you to help her out, Matt. Liz, this is Matt Forbes. He's kicked enough butt in his day to satisfy even you, and I was there in '79, the one time he smiled. - [Man] Lieutenant Adam, can I talk to you for a second? - [Ruth] I'm so glad you could come to dinner, Kevin. - You call the office 12 times a day, then you start in on Jay, you don't give people much of a choice, do you? - Yes, I well understand the hardship of having to eat a home cooked meal with parents who love you. - Don't start mother-- - I even baked your favorite pie. - It's very tasty-- - I've been thinking, it would be nice to have your boss, Mr. Brody and his wife to dinner soon. It would be good for your business. - It is my business, mother, - He really - Why don't you let me-- - Shouldn't have you wasting your time in residential properties. The real money is in commercial real estate. I'm not even sure his company's big enough for you. - Have I told you all about Ginny? - Ginny, who's Ginny? - Ginny Perham. The Perhams. One of the oldest families in Spokane. I'm sure you've heard of them. I think you'd like her. Maybe I'll invite her over for dinner. I mean, no sense in getting involved in another relationship without your blessing, right? - [Marie] Ut oh, he's back. Mr. Wonderful. - Well, he's nice. - Who's his South Hill? And what's he after a laundry manager for? As if I didn't know. - I was hoping you'd be on duty. This laundry has a certain attraction for pretty women. - [Ginny] Hi, Kevin. - Hi. Hi, Marie. - Hi, Kevin. Goodbye, Kevin. Call me later, Gin, okay? - It's good to see you, Ginny. Okay, I confess, there are laundromats closer to my house. How's school? - It's hectic. Exams are coming up. - I really admire you. Not a lot of people who would work full time and go to school. You're really something. Oh, I've embarrassed you, I'm sorry. But I meant it. Well, my laundry is calling. (romantic music) There is one question you haven't asked me, Ginny. - [Ginny] Well, actually there are lots. - The laundry; nightgowns, the lingerie. You have noticed, right? They're Jennifer's, my ex-wife's. She's an alcoholic. We got divorced about a year ago, she tried to make it on her own but she couldn't. I felt so sorry for her, I took her back. But no one can help her and I was foolish to think that I could. (Ginny giggling) - Yeah. (Kevin chuckling) - Well, my real name is Fred. Fredrick Harlen Coe, I chose Kevin. - Virginia K. Perham, it's nice to meet you. Very nice. And thank you for a marvelous lunch, Mr. Coe. - Ah. - What? - Oh nothing, really, I just fell while I was jogging, it's nothing really. - Oh, let me see. - No. What a klutz, falling while I'm jogging, huh? Where were we? I hope to see you soon. - Me, too. (Kevin whistling) - [Tom] Kevin, you got a moment? - [Kevin] For you sir, always. - But not for selling houses? - [Kevin] Pardon? - You've been here almost a year and you've done is run up office expenses. Not a single sale or single closing, nothing. - I understand, Tom, this is a business, you have to run it like a business. But the thing is, I have finally cleared away every distraction. I'm ready to go full-steam ahead into real estate. So, I even got a new car. Why? For clients. It's the only reason. - It's not just for lack of sales. You don't show up for floor time, you don't answer your messages, your mother calls constantly demanding to know where you are. I can't-- - She won't take her medication, Tom. I have pleaded with her. Look, I'll call her psychiatrist and I'll get her back into treatment, and I'll tell you what. I will forgo commissions on my next five sales. Fair enough? - I'm afraid I've gotta let you go. - Why? What did I ever do to you? - [Tom] Pardon? Kevin, this isn't personal. - Oh, please. Obviously this is some kind of vendetta. Afraid I'm gonna take your job from you, is that it? - Kevin, this business just isn't for you. Your mind isn't on it, but I'm sure you'll find something else. - Fine, it's cool. You know, you're doing me a favor. You ever heard of commercial real estate, Tom? That's what I'm into and I was gonna bring it to you, but you blew it. Who knows, maybe I can give you a job some day. (car engine rumbling) - [Tom] I need your lockbox keys. (muffled talking) - [Receptionist] Can I help you? - How dare you harass our family. First you vindictively fire son and then you hound us for some ridiculous key. - It is a lockbox key, Mrs. Coe. If he doesn't return it we'll lose our multiple listing rights in Spokane, to say nothing of a $1,000 fine, I need it back. - Do you have any idea who you're speaking to? We are the Coe's. My husband is the managing editor of the Courier, we are Spokane. You're nothing but a parasite, Mr. Brody, trying to suck a little pocket change from the wealthy. It won't work, and as for your precious key, you'll find it at the door when Hell freezes over. (keys jingling) (car engine rumbling) (tires screeching) He's an utter fool, a cipher. We needn't concern ourself with the Brody's of the world. - I couldn't agree more. Listen, I'll have another job by tomorrow. I'm not the least bit worried. I hope you're not. I got to think of that commercial property, you were dead right. It's a gold mine, it's just sitting there, it's waiting for me. I have so much I can do with it, I can, I can... - The problem dear, is you have no character. It's something I have finally faced, and we must do something about it now. Your car, you can't go to Gordon anymore if you're unable to make the payments. We will feed you, nothing more, not another dime. From this day forward, you will pay your own way in the real world. I will not have my own son be an embarrassment to the Coe name. (light dramatic music) Breakfast is at 7:00, dinner at 6:00. I don't care where you live, I don't even care about the sluts you choose for company, but you will pay your own way, you will live up to your name, and you will become a man. Now, go have your little tantrum if you must. I'll see you at dinner. We're having lamb, your favorite. - You rotten bitch! (upbeat music) (muffled talking) - [Man] That's hot. - It's a beautiful day here in Constad Park. Why don't you sneak out of your offices, come on down and say hi on your lunch break. (audience cheering) Get a little sunshine in your life. Now how about some digestive music. This is Sunshine Shelly on KQNT broadcasting to you live and in color. We're live and colorfully from downtown Spokane, the all American city. (audience cheering) - I read it. - His sorted sexual desires fit a pattern of other South Hill rapes. Now, if the damn newspaper can see a pattern, why can't you? - Don't push me, Trent, this articles gonna cause panic, the last thing we need. - 41 women have been raped, there are probably more. Bureau's still don't exchange information and we need an official centralized-- - We have never faced anything like this in Spokane, the mechanism isn't there. The mentality isn't there. The captain told me the best way for women to handle rape was just lay back and enjoy it. - He said that? - He said that. I'm doing what I can, Liz. And in the meantime, try decoys. Use male officers, you hear me? Dressed as women. Catch the bastard in the act. (light dramatic music) (paper crinkling) (keyboard clicking) - Excellent recommendation. I've heard of this group. They write a few letters they wrote to the papers. Real pro-Spokane organization. Jay seems to think pretty highly of you, too. I think you'll fit right in at Vista Reality. Welcome aboard. - I can't believe you're here Coe. The old team together again. - I'm here. I'm on my way Willy Jay, life has never been better, never. No more foolin' around. - [Jay] Well I'm glad to hear you say that, because we're not granted the same latitude you had at Brody. We either perform or we're outa here. - I may even get married, what do you think about that? - Ginny? It's gotten that serious? - Damn right, Jaybo, in fact, I may go give her the good news right now. - Now? We've got an open house at Newman's Lake. - I'll meet you there. Our first sale together. - [Jay] You'll never make it on time. - Speedy car. - Ooh, you smell good. (car tires squeaking) What? (hushes) - Listen. - What is it? - It's Jennifer's car. - You told me she wasn't here. - I also told you she was crazy, now stay there. Don't make a scene. - Hi, honey. - Hey. - [Jennifer] I got off early. It looks like you had someone over for dinner. I see you left all the dishes for me. - [Kevin] Jay came by. - [Jennifer] How does he rate at dinner? - [Kevin] You look great. - Oh thanks, thanks. You know, did you leave any-- (crashing) What was that? Somebody's here. Who the hell are you? Is this your latest, Kevin? Huh? Don't just stand there, get the hell out of my house. - Wait, wait, hey. Come on, come on, calm down. Now, I can explain this. This is, Ginny, where are you going? - Get her out of my house-- - Now look what you've done. - He ripped up my shirt and he was kinda like on all fours. He used, I can't say the words he said. Real dirty. - [Liz] Um, did he have an orgasm? - Excuse me? - I asked her if he'd had an orgasm, but she wasn't sure. She doesn't even know what an orgasm is. She is only 14 years old and her life is ruined, and somebody's gotta stop this guy. (dog barking) - Ginny. Ginny. Please, just hear me out. I didn't know Jennifer was coming over. She still thinks she lives there. I don't love her, Ginny. I just wanna be with you. I love you, Ginny. - You made me feel terrible last night. You lied to me, Kevin. - Never, I would never lie to you. - Well, I don't wanna see you again. - You don't mean that. You don't mean that. You wouldn't throw us away. I know what you feel. You just look me in the eye and you tell me that you don't love me. You just tell me and I'll go. Do you love me, Ginny? - Yes. I do. God, Kevin, I love you. - And we play among the huge oaks that line the driveway up to the main house and in the spring, oh Virginia, I can smell them to this day. The magnolias in full bloom, nothing is sweeter on Earth. It was a crime the way the Yankees ravaged us. Thank the lord we were able to recover from what they did. - Mother, I don't think Ginny wants to hear about the old south. - Why son, it's for you. Every girl wants to hear all about her man's family. Don't you love me enough to let me share my memories? Just look me in the eye and tell me that you don't, and I'll stop. (light dramatic music) I'm waiting, son. - Of course I love you, don't be silly. I just didn't want you to rehash the civil war. - Are you from Spokane, Ginny? - [Ginny] I was born here, but I traveled a lot. My father was in the Air Force, but I wouldn't live any place else. - She's studying art, writing and philosophy. I'm trying to get her into real estate, she is a natural for it. - Well, I admire anyone who can pull herself up by her bootstraps. - Oh, well you don't have to feel sorry for me, I had a wonderful childhood. - Would you like some more pie? - Oh, I couldn't, but it was delicious. - It's son's favorite. Oh, just look at you two. Such a handsome couple. Honestly, I was worried. Kevin hasn't always brought home the most suitable women, Ginny. I'm proud of him though. Fine new job, and you're so lovely. Can I say that without horribly embarrassing you both. (Ruth giggling) (Kevin chuckling) - You never told me she was from the south. - Well, she isn't, not really. She likes to pretend. Gone With The Wind is her Bible. It's harmless, though. She loved you. She told me. Did you like her? - Well, yes, I mean she's such a character. Your father seems like a real nice man, too. - Listen, Ginny, I've been thinking. You shouldn't be in that house alone and now that Jennifer has moved out, why don't you move in with me? - You mean live together? - Yeah, yeah, why not? - Oh, I'd like that, Kevin. - [Cashier] Price check register number six, code MI5 please. - [Woman] He tried to tell me no. Yeah, I meant to try it. - He's back. - [Cashier] Okay, here we go. Did you bring your coupons? Yeah? - Yeah. - [Cashier] You finally remembered. - I want him this time. - [Cashier] Okay, let me count 'em up here. - Let's go. - All right. - Hey. Hey. - Yeah? What are you, what? - You didn't pay for this. - Oh, I completely forgot. I'm sorry, I was thinking about something else. - Come on, we'll have to go inside. - [Kevin] What for? - For shoplifting. - Shoplifting? I told you, I forgot to pay. - [Man] You've been seen twice before. - Of course you've seen me, I'm a regular customer here. Now look, how much do I owe you, I'd never steal. - Come on, let's go upstairs. - Forget it. - Hey. - You run, I'll break your legs. - Are you nuts? Do you know who you're messing with. I will sue you blind. - Yeah, what's your name? - Go to hell. (door slamming) - When did this happen? - Huh? Oh, about three weeks ago. The manager tried to frame me. I simply forgot to pay. The thing is though, if I'm convicted, I'm dead. I mean, who's gonna trust their investments to a shoplifter? - Well, nobody in their right mind will find you guilty, just tell the judge. - No, don't be naive. Now these two guys, they'll lie their heads off. - Well maybe you should hire a lawyer. - A lawyer? Ha, I can defend myself better than any lawyer. I think what I need is a witness. I'd like you to testify for me? - You mean, like a character witness? - No, something like you were waiting out in the car for me and I came out and I remembered that I had forgotten to pay, and then I started back and these guys they grabbed me. Like that, how does that sound? - Terrible. That's perjury, I can't do that. - Ginny, oh you don't think I'm guilty, do you? - Well no, it was all just a mistake. Just tell the judge. - I need you to back me up. I don't think there's any other way that I'm gonna beat it. Just back me up, okay? - Forget it. I won't do it, Kevin. - I can't believe it. That stupid judge didn't buy a word of your story. Did he think you would lie? A person of your background? How can he be that stupid? - Kevin, I did lie. He just saw right through it. - It was some kind of pay off, I'm sure of it. I was framed. I'm morally opposed to all crime. I would never steal. Never. (muffled talking) - Kevin, please just drop it. You only got three days of community service, you should be happy. - Why are you turning on me like this? We're living together, this is your home. - My home? Jennifer's stuff is all over this house and I pay half the rent, remember? And Kevin, you just have so many secrets. Don't you trust me? (Kevin chuckling) Where are you going? Kevin what are you doing down there? - [Kevin] Don't come down here. - How can you just walk away from me like that? Kevin? - [Kevin] You know what I think? I think you're too selfish and immature for a real relationship, that's what I think. You can't even control yourself, don't try to control me. What is it, sex? Is that what you're after? - [Ginny] Oh, if I was looking for sex Kevin, I wouldn't be with you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. Don't go out. Where are you going? - I need to be alone. - [Ginny] Well, I don't wanna be let alone anymore. I want you here. - Get off my back! (door slamming) - You can't treat me like this, Kevin. I won't be here when you get back. - Who cares. I mean, who the hell cares? (car engine rumbling) (tires screeching) - [Shelly] That wraps it up for another night. Gotta go home and feed my parakeet. This is Sunshine Shelly saying good night, until another sunny day. (dramatic music) (leaves rustling) (heavy breathing) (Shelly screaming) - She was out there an hour, naked. It's 34 degrees. She won't let me touch her. (Shelly coughing) - Okay. It's gonna be okay. I promise you, you're gonna be okay. (Shelly gasping) He still hasn't given us a special rape squad. - [Matt] Give him time, Liz. - We don't have time. Listen, I've been thinking about something. Why don't we do it ourselves? Get volunteers, off duty cops, work on our own time. What do you think? - [Matt] Well, it's a good idea. - It's a great idea. I'll start to make some calls. - To your first sale. (glasses clinking) - To the first of many. Vista Reality has a much broader listing than Brody, including commercial property. Thank you very much. I have a great plan. - [Ruth] Or just plan to make a lot of money. You're the only insurance policy I've got. - Have no fear, mother dear, and thank you for lunch. Champagne is great. - You're a good boy, aren't you? - The best you've got. - Well, maybe not that good. You didn't have $8.08 that day? Oh, I'm not angry. I'm just surprised by how really stupid you are. And to get it erased from your record, well it'll be a little messy, but I'll do it. I'll do it. Now, why don't you have lunch alone. Now, don't be upset. I'm very proud of your new job and I like Ginny. I think she'll be very good for you. You know what the truth is, Kevin? I could dump you and never see you again and it wouldn't bother me a bit. (muffled talking) (phone ringing) - [Liz] Shelly. - Have you got anything? Anything at all? - No, not yet. - I slept in my closet for the first week. I'd come home, I'd take out a butcher knife and check in every square inch of my apartment. - Are you going back on the air, Shelly? - Oh, I don't if I-- - I miss you, you know. - I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. What else am I gonna do? Hide from him forever? David and I are getting a divorce. - Oh, no, Shelly why? I thought he was okay? (Shelly crying) - I wanted to talk about it. You know, I needed to talk about it to get everything out, but I guess... - [Man] Here it is, captain. - I guess the marriage just couldn't handle it. (Shelly bawling) (sprinkler ticking) (knocking) - Ginny, what a nice surprise. I'm afraid Kevin isn't home. - [Ginny] I know. - Oh, well, do come in. Have you had lunch? - Kevin and I had a fight and I was just hoping that you'd be able to help me to understand it. - Why even bother? He doesn't deserve you, Ginny, none of the Coe men are any damn good. They can't provide. I couldn't believe he forced you to pay half the rent. - He didn't force me, I offered. - Now, you don't have to defend him, I know what he is. - You know, I'm not so sure you do, Mrs. Coe. - I'm his mother, dear. Don't pretend you know what makes him tick. - I better go, I shouldn't have come. - Hi. Hi. What a nice surprise. My two favorite girls. - You're pathetic. How dare you take money from a woman. You call yourself a man? Are you completely spineless? - What are you talking about? I've never borrowed anything from her. - I am so sick of your lies. Are you using her money to pay your bills? - I pay all my bills and I'll pay you back every penny. - [Ginny] Kevin, let's go. - How dare you embarrass me like this. I wish you'd never been. - Oh, go ahead, say it mother. I've heard it before. Don't be bashful just 'cause Ginny's here. - My God, you are rotten. - Kevin, let's just get out of here. - All those promises he made, to take care of me, lies, all lies. You were gonna make so proud, you make me sick. I'm grateful you're merely my son and I never had to have you in my bed. (door slamming) (woman screaming) (fist thudding) - [Man] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - [Man] More bags over here. - How's the woman? - He almost broke her neck. He's getting more and more violent. If we don't stop him soon he's gonna kill somebody. - I got your rape squad, officially. And I've ordered them to do a complete statistical study of the rapes immediately. I'm sorry it took so long. - Thanks Lieutenant. - Hey, Liz. I think we made his car. The custodian described a silver gray Chevy that was parked over there about 6:30 with a warm motor, gone by 7:15, the time fits. - [Liz] Did he get a license number? - He can't have everything, but he did remember that it was in state, with a clear yellow cover over it to make it look personalized. What kind of a jerk would want it to look like he had a personalized license? (car door slamming) (dog barking) - Kevin? - [Kevin] Yeah? - Where have you been all night? I was worried about you. - You shouldn't have bothered. - [Ginny] Open the door. (knocking on the door) I said open the door. (banging on door) - What? - Can I come in? Open the door. Kevin! Kevin, open the door! Kevin! - [Kevin] Stop spying on me, I'm trying to wash up in here. - Kevin, open the door. (Kevin groaning) Kevin! - What? - [Ginny] What happened? - I was jogging, a dog jumped me. - [Ginny] No dog would mark you up like that. Did you get in a fight or something? It looks like fingernail scratches. - What, I was trying to get away and I fell in the bushes. Now don't mother me, I'm fine. I have to get ready for work now, okay? (door slamming) - You know, your mother was terrible last night. She's called four or five times since. I'm sorry about the things she said to you. - Don't be, I'm used to it. - I found something out about you. - Yeah, what? - [Ginny] I mean, in some ways you're a lot like her. - Of course I'm like her, that's the big thing that you found out? - But you don't have to be. I mean, she just has such a strong influence, it's the way that she wants you to be. Oh, I don't know. - No, you don't know. So why don't you just stay out of it. - No, I'm in it. I love you, Kevin. That's what I'm saying. I don't think she does. - Your mother killed herself. That's how much she loved you. - My mother was ill for a long time. She just couldn't take the pain anymore. She didn't do it to hurt me. - I know Ruth, she gets nuts sometimes. She'll get over it. - Oh, I'm sure, but will you, you're so-- - What? What? You think I'm crazy, right? Isn't that what this is all about? - No. I just think that she's harmed you. - Why do you care? - That's the whole damn point. I do care, but you lie to me. You keep secrets, you go places, you don't tell me where you're going. You don't trust me. Kevin, I love you. You don't believe that. You believe whatever it is that your mother tells you. I don't. I see someone to love. Someone trying to love me. Aren't you? (phone ringing) Don't answer it, Kevin. - Hello? - [Ruth] Hello, darling. - Hello, mother. - [Ruth] You all right, Coco? You sound strange. - I'm late for work, what is it? - [Ruth] Don't you have just a minute? Look, I'm sorry. We really mustn't fight anymore. Your barging in the house like that, I'm afraid I lost my temper and Ginny certainly didn't help things. - [Kevin] Just leave her out of it. - [Ruth] And then Gordon and I had a fight and I just, I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all. I'm glad you're there. I love you. - I have to go, goodbye. - Kevin. (thudding) - [Man] Unlock cell four when we get there. - Hey. Try to imagine it, the DMV moved quickly. Here's a list of every silver Chevy owner in Spokane. - It must our lucky day, here's the FBI profile. Wanna hear it? - Uh, okay, I guess so. Yes! - A power rapist seems to have a special hatred for medium sized dark haired women. Where is it? Oh, yeah. May come from a well to do family. The rapist is an underachiever who indicates that he's totally dominated by someone, possibly a parent. He's emotionally undeveloped. And, listen to this. Now, he's motivated by rage, not lust, and his main intent is to degrade the victim. They said that subconsciously he probably wants to degrade the person who dominates him. - And the hand down the throat? - Trying to shut her up. - [Liz] Her? Yeah, her. Well, whoever she is, she is good looking with dark hair. - This is just too weird. Listen to this description. He had a modulated sort of loving voice when he called me beautiful. I mean, what kinda creep is this guy? - Your problem is you believe everything you read. - What the hell have the police been doing all this time? There're vigilante gangs out there following bus lines with shotguns. I swear, if I had my old M-16 I'd be out there with 'em. - So part of your Christian ethic? Sounds terrific. - [Jay] Hey, what's wrong? Kevin, are you okay? - Of course I'm okay. - Are you sure, because lately you've seemed a little uptight and weird. - Don't call me weird, Jay. - All right, a little moody then? - You're my friend. I know that, so I'm gonna tell you what's wrong, okay? Life is too short for everything I wanna do. I wish I had more time. - What's the matter? Did I do something to turn you off? - I can't. I can't. Nothing's happening. - It's okay. - Its not okay, it's humiliating. - Well, we can just lie in each others arms and fall asleep. Being together is just the same as making love. - I'm sorry. I can't do anything right. I try to show you how much I love you, and look what I do. My mother's right, I'm an idiot. - Kevin. - You don't do anything that she does. You're not anything like she is. You don't belittle me like she does, you don't punish me. When I, when I was a kid. - Kevin. You know, you can tell me, I love you. - When I was a kid, and I would put my feet on the sofa, she would make me sit absolutely still for an hour, and that damn dog of hers could jump on everything. He was more important to her than I was. She wanted to abort me, she told me. She was right, it would've been better if I had never been born. - Don't say that, sweetheart. Come here. Forget about her, forget about everything. - I wish I could. She was right about one thing. - What? - That you were the right girl for me. You are. I don't, I don't deserve a girl as good as you, Ginny. - It's okay. We don't have to stay in Spokane, we can move to L.A.. Oh, don't cry, baby. Please don't cry. It's gonna be all right. (muffled talking) - Morning. - I think we found our guy. Out of all the Chevrolet owners, one lives right here. - Right in the middle of South Hill. From a well to do family. So, what's wrong? - Car is registered to Gordon Coe, managing editor of the Courier. - You gotta be kidding me. - Not him, his son. - Frederick Harlen Coe. - No. - [Matt] You ever see this guy? - Yes. That's him. I mean, his hair is different, but, but that's him. - [Matt] You're absolutely certain? - Well, I'd like to see him and hear him talk, but, but, yes I'm almost positive. - We can't pull him in on a 13 year old photo, we need a recent one. - Didn't you say he sells real estate? - Yeah, but so what? - Don't you need to buy a house? - Judy? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Kevin Coe. - Oh, nice to meet you. - Hi. - My husband and I love this neighborhood. Now, isn't there a school up on the next block? - I don't know. - Oh, because I was driving by this one, I thought it to be a school with a yard or something that I didn't know if it was like a junior high. - Hello Ginny. Here, let me help you with those. Don't you just loathe shopping? - How did you get in here? - [Ruth] I know where he hides the key. Honestly, when I see how he lives I'm appalled. There's no furniture in there. Where do your guests sit? - Mrs. Coe, I really don't appreciate you coming in to my house like this. - Now, now, it's not your house yet, Ginny. I'm sure Gordon's still paying for it, and take that sour look off your face, I'm not gonna steal anything. Including Kevin, he's all yours. You're the best thing that ever happened to him. I wish you luck. - It's me. I checked out the rents in L.A., guess what, they're not as bad as we thought. - What rents? What is this? Are you going somewhere? I demand to know. Kevin, is this another one of your skulking deceptions? - Relax, mother. You spoiled the whole surprise. The deal in L.A., the disco, it's set. We are going to L.A.. Ginny and me and the. Gordo, he can visit on the holidays. - Oh, I don't believe any of this of course. - Doesn't matter whether you believe it or not because it's true. Ginny didn't even know till this very moment. - Los Angeles Coco? - Not Los Angeles. Malibu. Bev Hills. - Oh. (Kevin chuckling) - Okay, okay, we'll be practical, Brentwood. A nice house, we'll rent before we buy. A warm climate. Us in the dirty dancing capital of the world, with a disco, and the best of all, not in Spokane. (Ruth giggling) - Oh, yes. - [Doctor] Take 25 milliliters. - [Woman] Dr. Granville, please call the operator, Dr. Granville. Dr. Burrows, call 125 West. - Hey Liz, it's Matt. Jeanie Maise. No, she can't talk, he used an oven mitt this time. Nearly tore her throat out. Yeah, they think she'll make it. They hope. - You be on the D.A.'s desk 8:00 a.m. for a warrant. I will get ahold of Irene Pool, show her these photos. Tomorrows the last day of freedom for this filthy son of a bitch. (knocking on door) - Are you Ginny Perham? - [Ginny] Yes. - I'm detective Liz Trent, we have a search warrant. May we come in? - [Ginny] This is my boyfriend's house, he's not here right now. - We know where he is. I wanna talk to you. - [Officer] Bob you take the kitchen. - [Officer] You got it. - [Officer] You go back in the hallway, I'll check this way. - [Officer] Yes, sir. - [Officer] This like the one we looking for? - Shall we sit down? - Check those closets. Look for any garden suites. - Sure. - Ginny, Kevin is wanted for first degree rape. We think he's the South Hill rapist. Several women have identified him. I'm very sorry for your sake. - Kevin? Well how? I would know. I mean, I would've known. - Now Ginny, we need your help to find some of these things. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Kevin. - [Officer] What's the color on that parka? - I don't understand. These things were here a few days ago. - [Officer] Liz. - Are these his? - Yes. He was washing them like last week and asked him why, but he wouldn't tell me. Is it important? - Ginny, you must've seen some things without really knowing what you were seeing. Would you be willing to testify? - No. I couldn't do that. - I've seen this house. Pictured it in my mind. The the way great things are conquered, from women to wealth. But this house is rare. It's located a Big Sur, 1,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean. Made from rough hewn timbers scavenged from ship wrecks. Glass on glass. - Frederick Harlen Coe. - I'm Kevin Coe, can I help you? - You're under arrest for the rape of Irene Pool. - What? - There must be some mistake. I don't even know this women. Are you guys confused? - No, we're not. You're the one we want. Cuff him. You have the right - Is this some kinda joke? - To remain silent. - What the hell is this? - If you give up the right to remain silent, - Is this a joke? - Anything you say can and will be used against you. - You can't take him. - In a court of law. - He hasn't done anything. - You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning. - Kevin, this is ridiculous. - If you so desire and cannot - Want me to call Gordon? - Afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge, before questioning. - This is a joke, right? - Get him outa here. - Do you understand each - Don't sweat it buddy. - of these rights as I have explained them to you? - [Jay] We'll get you out. (light dramatic music) - [Liz] Number four, read please. - Don't look at my face. Do as I say or I'll kill ya. - It's him. I'm positive. His voice. I'll never forget that. Never. - Thank you, Miss Pool, very much. (muffled talking) Hi, Shelly. How you doin'? - Well, I met some nice rape victims in the hall. It's a large group. Shall we get on with it? It's nothing. It was so dark, I never got a good look. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I was glad to hear you back on the air again. - Well, thanks for helping me get back. I wish that I had seen him. I should have fought harder. But I was so scared. - The way we look at it, Shelly, if you make it through a rape alive, you did the right thing. - You'd have to see the guys face in broad daylight and they'd have to be able to recognize him in the lineup cold, and even then you only get 2% convictions. - But six women have identified him. - Only six out of all those who came in. It's bad numbers for the good guys. He almost always attacked from behind and a night, he was very clever. I wonder how many didn't report. Never told anyone. Or they left town, they're too scared, too ashamed. I wonder what those numbers are? - [Man] Hey Walco. - I wanna win too, Liz, for the brave ones as well as the timid. (dramatic music) - Son. Son. I want you to look me in the eye. Kevin, I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you did not rape all those women. Can you do that? Just look me in the eye and tell me and I can get you out of here. - I didn't do it. I didn't rape those women. I'm innocent. - I know. I know, darling, I've known it from the start. They were just out to smear us, that's all. In a minute, Gordon. Don't you worry, Coco. I'll get you out. You'll be free soon. (dramatic music) I love you. - I hope you know I'm innocent. - I know. It just, it doesn't fit. Kevin, I hope you know that I'll do everything I can. (dramatic music) Mr. Coe. - [Gordon] Jay. - I think we need to step into your office for a moment, sir. (muffled talking) - But what does she think? - Yeah, put that. - [Man] I believe you have been good service before. - Mr. Coe, Kevin's guilty and you have to convince him to plea bargain. - Jay, I've seen the evidence. He's innocent. - He asked me to dispose of some evidence. I had it in my hands, Mr. Coe, in my hands. I got rid of that stuff, but when I saw it, I knew that he did it. All the funny little episodes and all the unexplained things. He did it, Mr. Coe. He's the rapist. - I understand how you might think that, Jay, but I've seen enough of the evidence to think he's innocent. - Mr. Coe, will you please wake up. Kevin has been lying and trying to charm his way out of everything his entire life, but this time it won't work, sir. He's guilty. - He lied to you constantly. You don't owe him a damn thing. He preys on honest people like you. You have to testify, Ginny. - But who would believe me? I lied for him in court once already. - So? Now you have a chance to tell the truth. Do you really think he loved you? The way you love him? (knocking on door) I'll get it. What the hell are you doing here? - [Kevin] Hi Marie, I'm out on bail. - [Marie] It's illegal for you to be here. - [Kevin] No, my dad's in the car, I'm in his custody. Is Ginny here? - I'm here. - Gordo bailed me out. Can you believe that? He sold the Cadillac. Marie, can we have a little privacy, thank you. - It's all right, Marie, really. - I'll be in the kitchen, call me if you need me. - Why are you here? - I had to see you. You didn't come to the jail, I was going nuts. - How could you do it? How could you make love to me and be out raping other women. - You don't really think that I-- - Oh, stop it. Stop lying to me, to everyone, to yourself. Women have identified you. Don't mock me by lying to me anymore. - Ginny, I'm not. I swear it. I have never raped anyone. I was even afraid of hurting you when we made love. Now how could I rape somebody? - You have hurt me so much, Kevin. I loved you. - And I love you, I adore you. - Oh, get your hands off of me. You don't love anything. There's nothing inside of you. Everything was lies, everything. You are so pathetic you make me sick. - You sound like my mother. - I'm sorry. - Ginny, I need your help. Jay refused to help me. Ruth is too obvious. I need you, Ginny. I need you to testify for me. You're the only one who knows what I'm like. You have to tell them what I'm really like, Ginny, please. Please. - [Man] Hey, Jack, get down here. They're here. (reporters talking over each other) - [Man] How about a statement for a-- - [Man] Please. - [Woman] Has he been naughty? - [Man] Mr. And Mrs. Coe. - [Man] A statement for the press, please. - [Woman] Mrs. Coe, was Kevin guilty? - Would you please give us room? (muffled talking) - He shoved his hand a little further down my throat so I really couldn't scream. He was wearing gloves. - [Lawyer] Can you describe these gloves? - They were dark leather. I can't be sure of the exact color. - And how do you know they were leather? - I tasted them. - Oh, what a case. - How terrible. - Sue Ann, is the man who raped you inside this courtroom now? - Yes. That man over there. - [Lawyer] Let the record state that the witness has identified the defendant Frederick Harlen Coe. - Sue Ann, in the police lineup, how did you identify the man who raped you. - It was the voice mostly. - According to this report you told officers that you never saw the man's face. Is that correct? - Yes. - I have nothing further. - I just don't think rape is any big deal. I've known a lot of women who were raped, didn't bother them. Picked themselves up, dusted themselves off. Very good friend of my mine was raped twice, didn't let it ruin her life. - Well, I think the courts take a different view of it, Ruth. - Oh, I saw that Irene Pool by the way, that jogger that Kevin illegibly raped. No one's gonna believe her. Older women don't get raped for heaven's sake. (knocking on door) - Surprised? - Actually, yeah. I've been following the trial. - Me too, I'm suing them all. The prosecutor, the city, Spokane P.D.. We can work on the lawsuits together Willy Jay, we'll be rich. Rolling in it. - Sure. - I was trying to catch the South Hill rapist. Now once they realize that they'll understand why I was out there where he was. Ruth knew about it. Honestly, Jay, it would really cinch it for me if you would testify. - To what? - That we were both out there trying to catch the creep. You'd pose as a women, I'd follow you in the car, and we'd wait for the rapist to attack. Like that. - Kevin, my credibility as a witness was destroyed when you asked me to get rid of that stuff for you. What if they ask me about it in court? - I'm being railroaded, Jay. The cops talked all those women into lying. Now, how am I supposed to fight a frame like that? They would never doubt a solid Christian like you. - Kevin, listen to me. If you want to get off, plead insanity. Try to get into one of those sexual psychopath programs. You'll be out in a year or two. - I would never lie about my sanity. Never. You know what the problem is? You think I'm guilty, Jay. Don't you? Come on, say it to your old buddy. Come on, say it! - I think you are guilty, Kevin. - Miss Perham, can you tell me what this is a picture of? - It's a photo I took last summer of Mr. Coe in his gray sweatsuit. - And what has happened to the sweatsuit? - It turned up missing the day Mr. Coe was arrested. - And did Mr. Coe where anything else when he went out jogging? - Yes, a pair of heavy black leather gloves. - Describe them for the court if you will please. - Well, they became more and more beaten up and I noticed a few tears. The last time I saw them they were all scarred and torn. At the end, the fingers were coming off. - Miss Perham, would you describe for this jury, what Mr. Coe would do preparatory to having intercourse with you? - Objection, I don't think the sex life at home as anything to do with this. - Subject irrelevancy. You may precede. - [Lawyer] Miss Perham, would you describe for the jury, exactly what Mr. Coe would do preparatory to having intercourse with you? - He... He would of, most often, the nod. He would. - His M.O. as a rapist was the same as in the bedroom. I think we've got him, Matt. - [Matt] He got himself. - Okay, bye. - Ruth. - [Woman] Okay, great, I need to get the file. - Didn't you tell Kevin that he was the best thing that ever happened to you? That he was lifting you up into a new social strata. - I don't remember using those words. - [Karen] Isn't it true, Ginny, that you wanted to marry Kevin Coe? - Yes. - And don't you now feel like a woman scorned? - No. - Nothing further. Defense calls Ruth Coe. (muffled talking) - Kevin tried very hard to catch the rapist. He felt it was his duty. The citizen review splash on rape in the bus routes inspired us to keep on trying. So instead of son jogging and me following him in the car, we followed the buses to see if a man got off when a lady did. We were hoping to identify a potential rapist. - [Karen] How many times did you follow buses with Kevin? - [Ruth] Oh, um, 10, 12, maybe more. I wish we'd been more successful. - [Karen] How would you characterize your sons relationship with Miss Perham. - Well, I know he felt the compassion for her that we all felt. - Objection, unresponsive. - Just describe the relationship between Kevin and Ginny. - Yes, well, I felt-- - Objection, witness is stating her feelings. - Sustained. Mrs. Coe, please answer the question directly. - Oh, thank you, Your Honor. It was like Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady. He gave her a sense of style, improved her posture, how she dressed. He accomplished an amazing transformation. - Mrs. Coe, you've testified that your son was with you at the times of the rapes he's accused of. - [Ruth] Yes, he was. - Do you remember that on April 14th, you told investigators that Kevin was with you while you went to visit a hairdresser? - Yes. - [Lawyer] And do you also remember that when the investigator checked it out, he found that Kevin was with you for only the last 15 minutes of your visits? - [Karen] Objection. - I'll withdrawal the question. Mrs. Coe, haven't you covered for Kevin before? - If you mean would I lie-- - [Lawyer] I'm asking whether you have ever said your son was with you at a time he was not. Yes or no. - No. I have never lied for my son. I don't have to cover for him. He has nothing to hide. - I can't believe he's gonna testify. - Rumor has it his lawyers couldn't stop him. He's an ego wonder. - [Karen] Please tell the court your name and address. - [Kevin] Frederick Harlen Coe. I live at 1418 South Tyler, Spokane 99206. - [Karen] Kevin, are you the South Hill rapist? - [Kevin] No. - Kevin, each time you ate dinner with your parents, why did you tell Ginny you went jogging? - There are great many things I didn't tell Ginny. She's an inquisitive person, jealous, and constantly insinuating that I was with other women. So I would be vague. I didn't think it was any of her business. - And were you just as vague when she asked you about washing the oven mitts? - I've never seen oven mitts in my house. Maybe the police planted them? - And the police planted the story with Miss Perham? - I didn't say that. But I would say that at least 90% of her testimony is false. - Is this the way you've always known Ginny to be? - Ginny's a sucker for anybody who's good at persuasion. The police may have manipulated her. - Mr. Coe, have you ever been convicted of a crime? - Objection, prejudicial and irrelevant. - [Lawyer] It is not only relevant Your Honor, but-- - [Judge] Approach the bench. (muffled whispering) - [Lawyer] Well his line of questioning to consider the relevancy, all right? - Overruled, restate the question. - Have you ever been convicted of a crime, Mr. Coe. - Of a misdemeanor, yes. - [Lawyer] What was it? - Third degree theft. - And what did you steal? - I didn't steal anything. - [Lawyer] My mistake, what were you convicted of stealing. - A steak. - [Lawyer] And after your conviction, did you write Judge Murphy, who presided over that trial a letter? - Objection, the letter is irrelevant. - [Lawyer] I will establish relevance if council will allow. - Overruled. Continue. - Did you write Judge Murphy a letter? - Well, yes. - Mr. Coe, let me read to you from your own letter to Judge Murphy. I quote, Miss Ginny Perham, a very classy young lady, with the upmost integrity was devastated that the judge would call her a liar. - She was devastated. - So, you think that Miss Perham is a lady of the upmost integrity until she testifies against you? - Well. No. Well, I mean, yes. - [Lawyer] Your witness. - [Woman] I think the biggest surprise was to find out-- - [Man] It isn't fair, it isn't fair. - [Woman] Mrs. Coe, do you think they'll find your son guilty? - [Man] Just a second, one shot here, miss, please, please. (reporters talking over each other) - [Man] Can I get a shot? - [Man] Was it smart to have your son testify? - [Bailiff] All rise, please. - [Man] All right. - Be seated. Madam Foreman, your verdict. Madam Foreman, you may read the verdict. - We, the jury, find the defendant Frederick Harlen Coe on count number one, not guilty. (audience groaning) - [Judge] Order, order. Order in the court! - [Woman] I'm shocked. - [Judge] Continue. - On count number two, guilty. On count number three, guilty. On count number four, not guilty. On count number five, guilty. On count number six, guilty. - The court is signing an order, jailing the defendant Frederick Harlen Coe. This court is adjourned. - [Man] Well, I guess he's gonna have to. (muffled talking) (phone ringing) - Detective Trent. You've gotta be kidding me. She did what? I, yes, I think we can handle that. - [Ruth] Terry? - Yeah, get in. - [Ruth] How do I know you're not police? - Do I look like a cop? How do I know you're not a cop? You want a job done? - Actually, there're two I would like taken out. One is a judge. A vicious cold man, a vicious, vicious man. The prosecutor, he's the other one. I have their names and addresses right here. How much cash are we talking about? - 500 up front, against 4,000. Is that a problem? - No, well, yes. I have the down payment now. The rest won't be easy, but I'll get it because it's worth it. - We are talking about the same thing here? You want these people-- Gone. - Dead. - Dead, right. Well, if I had my druthers I'd like to see the prosecutor as an addlepated vegetable so his family has to take care of him for the rest of his life. Diapers and everything. So, dead is great, but I think he should suffer. - You wanna be there? - Oh, I would, but I don't want it to lead back to me. Oh, marvelous. Marvelous. I'm glad I met you. I love this car, by the way. You keep it up beautifully-- - [Officer] Mrs. Coe, would you step out of the car please. You're under arrest for solicitation to commit first degree murder. - I, I don't suppose I have a letter from son? He's so loyal. He writes me often. I have a fine baby boy. Well, he's not really a baby anymore, but he'll always be my baby. Do you have children? No, I asked you that before. Everyone should have children, it's life's grandest experience. To watch them grow to come good and fine and strong. Someone to look after you in your old age. He was framed of course. It's unconscionable. All political, all of it, to get my family, to bring down the Coe's. And to what end? I'll never understand it. You know what Kevin and I share? It's much more than mother and son. It's closer, deeper. I know what he's feeling right now, and he knows what I feel, always. Nothing can ever come between us, nothing. No one can be closer than a mother and a son.
