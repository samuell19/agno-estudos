All right. Welcome to the director and editor's commentary on Atomic Blonde. This is David Leitch, the director. And I have Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir. Well done. Almost there. - Ronaldsdóttir? Ronaldsdóttir here. Pleased to be here. She's my collaborator on John Wick with Chad Stahelski and then on Atomic Blonde, and the heart and soul, always carves out the story. - Thank you. - We just shoot the pretty pictures. - You're being too kind. Elísabet finds the story. - And there's Ronald. - There's Ronald. No relation. But remember, we had so many incarnations of the beginning of the movie? Yes. Where, at one point, we almost went into documentary mode? Yeah, we were trying to tell the back story of the Berlin Wall, sort of this visual motif. And why there were spies there. Yeah. We had one of the test screenings... One of the questions that someone put on there was like, "Spies? Berlin?" So we found that entertaining for the rest of editorial. And there's Sam. Sam Hargrave, our stunt coordinator. He's also a really good actor. The Carl F. Bucherer watch. So that car hit is actually a combination of stunts and visual effects. That's some great practical effects right there. - Everything in camera there was real. - It's painful every time. And you know, per capita, this could be an Icelandic production. - It could be. - It could be. There we have Jóhannes, the Icelandic actor. There he is. Yup. - David S. Such a God's gift. - Yeah. - I loved the posters in the background there. - Yeah. No, I had an incredible production designer. But you're not the best, are you, Bakhtin? You're the biggest fucking cunt in the KGB. Sticks and stones, Jimmy. I always get sucked in. The close-ups to... Jonathan Sela's classic close-ups. - It's beautiful cinematography. - Absolutely. - And that's not real snow. - That is not real snow. What's good about Eastern Europe is you can do these snow candles. They look great. YUP- And that was all green screen. Beautiful background. There she is. So there was this idea of starting the movie with the mystery of this woman who's been beaten up and it was part of my pitch originally to Charlize that I want to see the real consequences of the action on the character's body and so I had some storyboards drawn up and it was part of my presentation and this was actually the scene, I think, helped hook her as me directing it. It's a beautiful scene and it's beautifully shot. Yeah. But I just want to point out, I actually did some breathing for that scene. - I know. You did. - It's the peak of my career. - I did breathing for Charlize Theron. - You did. - Green screen again. Another one. - Another again. Great comp by the Chimney guys. Here, this non-verbal storytelling and starting a movie out quiet, we did it in John Wick and it's an effective introduction to a character. You're going to hear all these needle drops throughout the movie and if you've seen it before, obviously if you bought this, you've probably seen it before, but it was the plan from the beginning to have music drive the movie and to have this sort of music video-esque motif going on. Yeah, please sing along. We're not allowed to. Yes, we're not allowed to sing along. Look at that. - Yeah. - That's one of... I have so many favorite shots in this movie, but that's one of them. Now, this dolly shot goes on for, like, another 12 seconds, but because Elísabet likes to get to the point, we cut it out and we're into the cigarette. I'm going to end up with hate mails. Such a cool cat. Music was so important that we would play it on set. I remember this first day, this is actually Budapest, not London. But we would play the track to the music so she could walk in step, -and had speakers blaring outside. - And look at that bus. David Scheunemann. - Love it. - Yeah. Again, it's like this sort of real minimalist composition, and every shot is super important, but just not a ton of coverage. No, but you know what you want. That's, I think, your signature. You go in and get what you need. - I love that. - Right. A lot of producers, but right there, Kelly McCormick. Probably one of the most important producers. She had the material first. I think Charlize was attached to the project. They brought it to Sierra/Affinity. Kelly was the creative on it, and she brought me into it. And we missed David Leitch. Atomic Blonde. Remember when it was The Coldest City? Remember when it was The Coldest City? - Yes, it was The Coldest City. - At some point. I also liked the title, The Coldest City. And I found it spoke to the '80s as well. Like "coldest" takes on a lot of meanings in the '80s. It means hip, it means cool. But Atomic Blonde just sort of makes sense. Yeah, it grows on me every day. Where's C? Given the scale of recent world events, C will not be joining us. - Just look at those shots. - I know. I love the layers and the reflections. Yeah, there was a lot of planning to sort of build the mystery and the confusion. And this frame. We actually pulled it out of focus even more in post. Before we begin, sir, may I formally request that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed from the debriefing. Request denied. - It's Lorraine opposite the patriarch, right? - Yeah. And I'm here with the full executive authority of Langley. So, we did some ADR cleanup here to get some real... - Yeah, to carve out the... - The story. To set up the story and characters involved. But it wasn't much. Sometimes we work our way out of some of the stuff we find necessary, and then we can take it away. - At some point, we had a lot more ADR there. - We did, we had a lot in there. - It felt like we had to explain more back. - We had to work our way through it and back. But what I found working with you is that the soundscape... I mean, outside of a million other things working with you. The soundscape is so important and, like, one, two, three placed ADR lines can solve a problem and they're seamless to the movie or allow you to restructure something. Yeah, especially when you're working with such great people. I mean, just the level of professionalism is stunning sometimes. - I love it. - Yeah, some great people. "The Beginning." My favorite title. So I wanted to get provocative with not only the music, but then with the graphics as well. I think people get stuck in the rut of, like, the medium has to be a certain way. And because it's a visual medium, you can play with things like that. I'll always try and try something like that. Remember we changed this scene because they were having this conversation without her and then we decided that in order to keep the whole interrogation thing through her eyes, that she was telling the story, we decided that it needed to be her. She needed to be there to... - Yeah, her view. - Her view. - That she is telling us the story. - Correct. Yeah. The West German Police fished his body out of the Spree this morning. Yeah, I know. And I think this was our biggest construction of new ADR. Yeah, absolutely. Where it's like there were two separate scenes, and we cut them together as one. We promised Spyglass immunity. That's a piece of ADR right there, -but you'd never know. - Loads of new ADR. It's a complicated story with all the different characters. And words that we actually had to cut out, like "glasnost." Yes. People didn't wanna hear these '80s political terms. Yeah, that just confused them. Yeah. "Spies? Berlin? Really?" "Not really a war, just a boring stand-off." That was a good one as well. But even that shot, just before with Yuri, that was a comp. - Like this, it's a comp. - Right. Yeah. We were adding stuff and changing... We were adding titles underneath the people, like anything we could do to get that information across in an efficient way. I love this idea of a spy in East Berlin, dealing in contraband, trying to get information, working with the youth, the underground movement. This idea was what changed the whole script. Yeah. The Jordache wasn't easy. It's for my wife's birthday. That's really nice. Now, where's that fucking list? - Such a great cast. - Yeah. So proud of it. - I'm humbled by them. - Yeah. I think you said it best. It's like you watch the movie and you're like... The way they deliver dialogue and bring characters to life, it's... Yeah. I risked everything. No list, no deal. You listen to me, Spyglass. Without that list, why shouldn't I take you outside and shoot you in the fucking head? You are going to kill a Stasi officer? One that's about to defect to the West? Yeah. Again, I just started watching the movie. - I know. It's fun. - We need to keep talking. That's a good ADR line there, "buggered sideway." -"Buggered sideways." -"Sideways." That's so good... So British. "Sideways." Yeah, so James came up with that. - Yeah, in the ADR session. - Yeah. of their recently deceased son. Your mission is to connect with Percival... She's so stunningly beautiful. Yeah. Trust no one. But I think it's also what makes her more beautiful, in my eyes and in this film, -is just, she's so strong. - Yeah. There's like this... She brings this core to the character, makes her dangerous in a beautiful way. Yeah. Maria? This is a little vaudeville routine that these guys had. They had done a movie together where it was like a comedy. So they had great timing and they had the lines perfect. We did consider riffing off "Maria" a couple of times, -but we never did. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Also because we moved the scene. James basically got three takes on both sides of the line for the action, and that was it, we were running out of light. There used to be a shot, Bremovych was outside of the... - Yeah. - Yeah. - Herding up the teenagers. - Herding up the teenagers. This was like, "How do we create this underworld, "the secret crossing?" "How do we create danger?" A lot of this stuff wasn't originally in the script. It's just, "How do you infuse some action into a noir spy thriller?" And keep Leitch's tone, with the hat? That was like just... - Just a little bit of fun? - Yeah. Apparently, spies drink quite a bit. And you played the music there to get the timing... - Yes, we... - On set. Here comes dolly back. Yes. And we spent a lot of time to decide the level of sunlight outside the window. - That was a big one. - Yeah, we were going back and forth. Yeah. - And now this scene was repurposed. - Yeah. And we had this later on when she was arriving at his apartment. Yep.- But it kind of worked to tell the story that he was late for the airport. Late, yeah. And even though... - Because this is not linear storytelling. - Right. It's non-linear, but it still kept us in a linear feel. - Correct. - Even though it's completely non-linear, which I like. Gosh, I get so many flashbacks watching this movie. Just the stamp on the passport is like... "We gotta change the date. Change the date." Yeah. Yeah, that was a visual effect shot. - Right. Yeah. - Yeah. He sent me to pick you up. Checked bags? So that was our excuse. "Checked bags?" "No, they've been sent." Well, we're gonna have 25 costume changes for Atomic Blonde. So she's gonna need a suitcase. Well, James Bond gets them sent as well. - Exactly. It's all good. - Yeah. - That was actually in Berlin, right there. - Yeah. We did shoot a week in Berlin or so? Was it a whole week? - It was like five days, yeah. - Yeah, probably. Yeah. So... Is this your first time in Berlin? I had a really small stunt team headed by Sam Hargrave on the movie, and you're gonna see a lot of great fight scenes. And I just tasked them with the idea to, like, make them creative and visceral. Yes, the business card. - We were wondering how to play that. - Yeah. And if people would ever catch it. Yeah, I just loved that. We have this thing, you and I, every movie. We've only done two. But both of them, we make a rear-view picture that we compile ourselves. Yeah. We did that in John Wick and we did it now. - Yeah. - And this one ended up in a trailer. - I was so proud when I saw that. - Yes. That was funny. It's an amazing fight. There are some second unit shots from Sam in here. It's funny, in my second unit life, I shoot a lot of B, C camera, but on my directorial life, I don't shoot much B camera. But sometimes you just need it to get through the day. Yeah, absolutely. - And Sam was so amazing on this movie. - Did an incredible job. - And he's the guy that flips the car. - Yeah. - It's Sam driving? I didn't know that. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna give him a hug next time I see him. - Yeah. - That was well done. And on the third take of that, James ran over the dolly track, by accident. So people were running out of the way. I'm David... Where the fuck were you? Don't shoot. I've got your shoe. - The shoe. - Yeah. So, I like this sort of setting up the tone of their banter. Yeah. For fuck's sake. Russians are fucking heavy. - ADR. - There you go. Yeah, because we had to make sure -people understood they were Russians. - He was Russian, right. - And then we still got a joke out of it. - Yeah. I love post. This is like... Just more of like... And those graphics shots are always inspired by David Scheunemann. - He does great concept stuff. - Absolutely. "Like, "Okay, we're gonna have a piece of the wall. "Let's put the Brandenburg Gate behind it." I'm like, "Cool, we'll just slide the car in front of it." Yeah. Disastrous Sinéad O'Connor hair. My... This... Kelly McCormick's joke, by the way. - That's so funny. - That was written on the fly. "It's to blend in." I love the idea that the American CIA is explaining to the Brit... Who the Irish singer is. - Right. - It's so good. that you're going to be able to help me find that list? And they have such chemistry, those two. It's so much fun. Yeah. That's Checkpoint Charlie. My office is just back there. I'm not here to collect postcards, Percival. I have to say this. I love, she's not taking any mansplaining here. - No. No mansplaining. - It's like, "No way. " -"I'll figure it out." - Yeah. -"I can read a fucking map." -"I can read a fucking map." So, I love the cast on his arm. That was actually an accident over the holidays. We had a hiatus, and he was on the movie Split. And he called me and he's like, "I broke my arm. Broke my hand." And there was panic for two, three days until I figured it out. I'm like, "Perfect. We're gonna embrace it." And it works really well. I'm so happy. It's just another... - It's actually a plot point in the movie. - Yeah. - Well, done, David Leitch. - Thank you. Bremovych. Yeah, found this location. There's so many of these great locations in Budapest. Look at his hair. I love it. It's amazing. And Roland. Yes. - Chad was trying to get him for John Wick 2. - Yeah. And that's where I found out about him, until we did the audition, and I'm like, "He'd be great." - And he is great. - He is great. - A mean bastard. - Yeah. - There's this intensity to him. - Yeah. There's a mischievous nature in his eyes. You believe what he does to this kid. You're like, "He'd probably do that." - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - He works great for this role. Absolutely. - Yeah. This is another thing that the studio at first... By the way, the studio was really supportive. Guys at Focus were great. Josh McLaughlin was great. They were hands-off, but this is one of the scenes they didn't get. It's like, "What? Why 99 Luftballons while he's beating the kid?" Like, "We don't get it. We're confused." And they were there the day we shot it and they were like, -"Totally get it." Yeah. -"Totally get this." And the subtitles. - Yeah. - I like the subtitles. - I love how you went for the old burn-in look. - Yeah. Like I remember from my childhood. - Yes. - Yes. - That it was like burned into the film. - Yeah, yeah. Daniel. Yes, Daniel Bernhardt, he makes an appearance in all our films. - As he... - But he's blond there. - Yes. - That's really cool. You actually had the nicest stunt team. It was hard to make them look cool and hard. Yeah, we had to go to real severe looks on them to make it work. Nicest people. Gotta work with nice people. Life's too short. That's why I work with you. See? That's why I work with you. as civil disobedience continues to build momentum. East Berlin's youth leaders shout out their protests... Remember this? Because we talked about making Berlin a character of its own. Yeah. And you got the same guy to read all the news. - I love that. - Right. That really worked well, I think. BMW gave us the classic bike, which was a... "How long are we on the logo?" Yeah, we actually considered CGI-ing the logo on it -just for it to stay longer. - Yeah, on the windscreen. I love this shot. Okay, this was such a battle to keep this shot in, and I wanted it in for mood and feel and vibe, because it's so quintessential '80s. And this scene is like a tribute. I feel like it's a tribute to European film. I love it. No, it's like we're overlapping dialogue, it's the editorial style. Which department? A different one. And Barbara. - Yeah, she was amazing. - Yes. She's one of my favorite icons. We shortened that scene a lot. Here's another battle. They're like, "Okay, we're gonna break the fourth wall." "What? The film is burning?" And I'm like, "Guys, it's Berlin. Everybody's on drugs. It's fine." Just have a little psychedelic moment. It's my favorite. There you go, girl. The passport number is incorrect. But for me, I think it also helps in just keeping us in this realm -that she's telling us this story. - Yes. - It's from her perspective. - Correct. She's telling the story, which helps when we understand all the lying. Which helps when we understand all the lying. Right. Right. And, I think, one of the directives from the beginning was cool overrides everything, so... Like this shot in a bathtub was like, "Do we really need it?" Yeah, I mean it says something about her character, just like the weird film burn, but it's also just visually stunning, and we're trying to create a mood and a world. Yep.- Jonathan Sela colors, and David, these guys, they're working with us now again. - I have the team all back. - Of course. Yes. - I'm so excited. - Super stoked. There we did a split-screen to tighten up the action. To match up the... Yeah, tighten up the timing. Yeah, it worked well. But you did that... We didn't even do it in... Or did they... - No, we just did it in... - In the Avid? Because it was a static camera, it wasn't a problem. You've got some balls breaking in here. You should see my balls, then you'd be really impressed. Ball joke. Can't go wrong with a ball joke. But I laugh every time. I'm silly like that. I'm here for at least another week. I think, when we saw their banter, everyone was like, "These guys are gonna get together." - Right? That was the whole thing... - Yeah, yeah. Like they're gonna get together. And then, one of the things I like about the movie is... - It subverts your expectation all the time. - Yeah. Exactly. For better or worse, I hope for better. - David, this film looks so good. - It's... Yeah. I haven't seen it for a while in a good quality like this. It's stunning. It's a gorgeous film. And I love how he keeps the cigarette in his mouth the whole time getting punched and kicked and talking and... - He never drops it? - No. - He doesn't... - Yeah, it was great. There it goes. - That's the only kiss we're getting. - Yes. - That'll be the only exchange of DNA. - Yeah. Right there. Knock yourself out. We're like always looking for a transition for that scene. - But I think that... Yeah, it works. Works. - It works fine. Yeah. I had 24 more walking shots that Elísabet cut out, just so you know. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You can have it on the DVD. Can I have the director's cut back? No. It's much better when you cut it. Til came on to do us a favor. This German icon. And he was such a lovely guy. He has the greatest look. There we have our TV announcer again. Right. Do you remember when we were writing the news? Yeah, we wrote out the news report. - How about... - We should get that job. This shot here of Sam, we shot in the back of the camera house. - Yeah. - With just a sheet over Sam. One afternoon in Editorial, Sela came in and we took a camera off the shelf, and we lit it, and we put it in the movie. - Because that's what you do. - Yes. - You just make things happen. - Just make things happen. It's well done. No, and I think it's an important pick-up to do, -like, just to keep him in the mix and... - Yeah. -like, just to keep him in the mix and... - Yeah. And her conscience. - And her bigger... - And get her over to his apartment. - Her bigger existential crisis. - Yeah. - Like everybody's dying. - Exactly. 'Right? - It helps set up stakes. - Yep. So, the score you're hearing is from Tyler Bates. And he found a way to bring the '80s into this sort of contemporary score, glue all these tracks together in a really compelling way. And hear the tension and the simplicity in this. Yeah, there is this sense of a clock ticking without it being a clock ticking. I love it. And even before we started the movie, he had sent me a lot of riffs on it, like from the script, and I had told him all the needle drops that we had. And he was like, "Here's how I wanna connect them." We're like... Tangerine Dream was our touchstone, and it's great. Yes. But the list wasn't our only problem. And this is something we moved from the beginning up till there, the scene that comes now. Yeah, the reveal of Satchel we just slid till the end of the first act. Yeah. Spyglass revealed that this list would expose a double agent by the name of Satchel. It was great, because then that room starts to arc. - It has its own story. - Yeah. He's a black eye to the Crown. "...in MI6 history." Yeah, his voice is so juicy, it's hypnotizing. Yeah. You might find yourself taking tea at Buckingham Palace. And it was also to bring up this line. - Like, take it out and carve it out... - Yes. "Tea with the Queen." "Tea with the Queen." Toby and James really busted my balls about British and "What would the British say?" It was funny. - But anyway, we got great stuff. - Yeah. They were just like, "We would never say 'tea with the Queen.". I'm like, "Really? "I could've swore you would've said 'tea with the Queen.'" "Like, you're English. No? Okay." "Okay. 'Coffee'?" Right. "Buckingham Palace'? Okay, great." You get those notes, but then you realize that they're actually great notes. Yeah. And if I knew he was going to call the police, I would have worn a different outfit. - This is a pick-up. - Yeah. David Scheunemann... No, we were shooting still and you were cutting the scene together, and you said we should really have... 'Cause I knew I wanted to cut it to music, but... Yeah, they're like, "Let's see her put it on and crank it up as a distraction." - It was a great idea. - Yeah. I mean, it gives it a purpose. Again, look at those shots, David. Be proud. Just all of those reflections, it's amazing. The reflections was like a motif for the deception. You don't know what is real and what isn't. - That was the idea. - Works so well. Jonathan and I, from the beginning, were talking about, "How do we do that? How do we keep people..." "Thinking throughout the movie, visually?" When the guys, the team started to choreograph this, I wanted it to be like found-prop fight in this style of Jackie and then a little bit... But more violent, like a Bourne-ish thing. But I never thought they'd take it to this level. It's great. I already had the idea of, like, I wanted to do the counterweight jump out the window. Wrap a rope around a guy's neck and jump out the window. That was the only real piece that I gave them and then they came up with all the rest. - It's great. - It's good. It's amazing. I'm sometimes asked if it's not difficult to edit action. And it's like, "Not with David Leitch and his team." Because it's choreographed so well, so it's just... Yeah. And how it's shot, it's exact. But we did... We brought Sam into Editorial... Absolutely, yeah. And he also had his opinions on different shots he thought were better, and that was a good exercise, too. - Absolutely. - I got some great takes. No, this is so good. - This scene was in and out for a moment. - Yeah. This almost didn't make it. It was gonna be a Comic-Con teaser. Yeah. So, this was gonna be broken up into five shots and then we did the rehearsal on set for the wide shot, and I'm like, "Why are we cutting?" And then Sela's like, "Let's just dolly into her close-up." And then Sela's like, "Let's just dolly into her close-up." And I'm like, "Great! Do it." So we never... - Part of it was time, but part of it was like... - Yeah. -"Let's show that it's her." - Yep. So, that's a little Easter egg. You got the Shibumi book. Shibumi and John Wick. The guy at the airport's reading Shibumi. as the calm before the storm. It's not just new faces that are called for, but perhaps a complete demolition of the wall. - I love this, that... Look at this. - It's beautiful. It's amazing. The Chimney guys did well. The wall, David's work. Yeah. We shouldn't talk too much about the smoking. It's a period film. But we cut out the scene where the kid picks up the cigarette -and then she goes back and, "No way." -"No way." Yeah. Let me take your coat. So the scene of Percival getting out of bed with the two chicks used to be there. Right. Right before that. Yeah, she would call him up and he would ask her to give him a moment. Fucking hell. So, it's supposed to look like contraband everywhere. There's like that Hustler poster in the top-right corner. Yep, and Machiavelli. Yes, that's in payoff. Yeah, I wanna live in his apartment. "Right? - Yep." Or put up Editorial. - Yeah, there you go. - Why not? And we could smoke there. I wrote the Hustler joke, so I kept it in. Yeah. I don't know if it ever... No one ever laughs. It's maybe just for me. "Champion of free speech." Get it? Very funny. I like her face when she just goes, "Whatever, dude." - So... But he is a champion of free speech. - That's my joke. - I'm sure. - It's ironic. Isn't it? But we did cut out a lot of dialogue there. Yeah. To build the mystery. To build the mystery and not have too many things explained. And a picture of the two of you together a few years back. - Then left it hanging on that line. - Exactly. - No. - No? I must have forgot to. Yep.- Get your coat, love. I really like that. - They never explain each other. - Yeah. - It's like... No. - They're like, "I'm not telling you shit." - Exactly. - Right? "And that's why I'm a spy." Yeah, again, I get flashbacks. I'm sure I had this hairdo at one point, like, the comb. I think I wanted that jacket but I never had it. - I love this shot. It's just... - It's beautiful. And you can only do it with two good actors. Like, we had to live in this one take. I'm not buying it. That's great. And you have to be beautiful to wear this outfit. He's doing it so well. But remember, we had a note on the sweaters, Percival's sweaters. - Yeah. - At one of the test screenings. I'm gonna tell you. Everyone's gonna be wearing sweaters like this. - Next autumn. - I hope so. Halloween, people will dress up like Percival. Yep.- So, there's the business card she got from the Russians. That was supposed to be a cue that... She's gonna be meeting the Russians. And talking about Sela tracks, Sela-David Leitch tracks... Yeah. This is so good. Yeah, I love this. So, if you're wondering, most of the songs were picked and we knew the song we wanted in the scene. Stoli on ice. - Yeah, I love this shot. It's crazy. - Beautiful. We haven't cut. It's still the same shot. And in focus. - All the time. - And in focus. Sure. It was your idea for the piano music in the background. Yeah, it was so we could make the Swedish joke. Yeah, that's true. Because why would she say that if it wasn't for the music? - Right. Right. - But, yeah, we did have another line there about his accent. But, because he's Danish, we thought it was not gonna... Yeah, you were keeping us true to all the European sensibilities. I couldn't tell the difference between anybody's accent. Yeah, okay... But I appreciate it, because, I think, internationally, this movie -will be well-received, I hope. - I'm sure. Look at this shot. And we cut out so much dialogue there. Just this, them looking at each other and smoking, tells volumes. - Yeah. - I really like it. And Sofia. French women. "French women." For the longest time, we kept in the take where he said, "French woman." - Yeah, it was so good. -"French woman." - It was fun. - Yeah. Alone. Ladies, Berlin is a small place. But there was a lot more dialogue there and we cut it out, thankfully, I think. - Yeah, I think it just keeps the mystery alive... - Yeah, absolutely. And we were really believing people were following the story. Sorry. And even with their dialogue, there was a lot more. Yeah. Well, I appreciate the gesture, Miss... Lasalle. Delphine Lasalle. Pleased to meet you. It's breathtaking just looking at those images, going, "Gosh." Maybe a rock star. And there is some good chemistry there as well. Yeah. And so I did audition quite a few actresses to play Lasalle, but the first person I always had in mind was Sofia, and it was her sensibility as a person. - She is this sort of Bohemian kind of... - Absolutely. She feels like someone who would've been in Berlin at that time. - Yes. Exactly. - You know? So... David Hasselhoff's in town. - We never considered taking that joke out. - No. - It's so funny. - But people wanted us to. - But I... "David Hasselhoff." -"David Hasselhoff's in town." It's just too good. So, the Watchmaker, he's a man of mystery. What side is he on? He's sort of a middleman informant. Yeah. Yeah, we don't really know his role, but, yeah, mystery. Yeah. In my opinion, like he's long lead, sort of CIA. - Providing information. - And he has this look. - Yeah. - The million-dollar look. And there is the cast. So, this is just one of those targets-of-opportunity shots where it's like we have a great set piece in the corner, and I saw these vintage headphones and I'm like, "Let's just get a shot of him behind the reel-to-reels" "and pulling his wire out, listening. We'll use it somewhere." - And we did. Well done. - Right. Again, all CGI, like, green screen in the windows and the mirrors and... Amazing work. And the TV, I think, as well. - There's our product placement shot. - Yup. So, for the longest time, I thought there might be confusion between using the watch for the list and using the watch for this sort of stuff. But then it... That's a great visual effects comp right there. But it seems like it worked for people. That was just a way to hide things. You can keep it on your person. You should have applied for a visitor's permit. What kind of work do you do? Legal affairs. Yeah, and we did some ADR there, as well, just to carve out why she was going over. If you do not return before 6:00, you will be arrested. Do you understand? I understand. She's so unlike herself with those brown lenses. The brown eyes, right? Right now, I'm not feeling very confident about this story of yours. We reconstructed a lot of this interrogation material. So, this actually used to be further to the end, I think. Yeah, 'cause we were really trying to make it arc and build. I remember when we had the whole wall of the post with all the dialogue from the interrogation room on little cards, and rearranging them around. Correct. Yup. So these few shots in Alexanderplatz, and then here, the east in Berlin at the Kino International. These are in Berlin and were shot practical. There's very little visual effects. David Scheunemann's like, "We're gonna find these great angles "of these buildings that are still period." That's all... Just some picture cars, and that store behind and this theater and... - It's all working. - Yup. Yup. And the Stalker. Yup, which was playing in East Berlin in that time. Not that day, but in that window of time. There's also another poster for a movie called Coming Out which was playing in East Berlin at the time. No, Stalker speaks volumes. Remember, at some point, we used as a placeholder, a scene from The Witness? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we thought... - Because we thought we need more fight. Yeah. We thought we needed a little bit more fight after -the behind the screen. - After he throws her off the stage. But it was funny. We were getting so used to watching this and then the little boy was... Yeah. And then we'd see this scene we'd cut in from Witness crawling through the stalls. "We're gonna do some pick-up shots." So, this was just an idea that I had. "How do you make a simple fight more cinematic?" We just needed a mane a mane. And with some budgetary constraints, you just get creative. - And a set of keys. - And a set of keys. Yes. But what I love to watch is those tall people fighting. It just gives different aesthetics. Yeah. No, they have great lines and so you can see the motions better. - It's like a dancer who's tall. - It's beautiful. - That's some impressive CGI. - It is some good CGI. We actually added this as an ADR line. He just wants to talk and stuff which, I feel, it's so important. Like you say, when people watch the film back they can pick up on stuff like that. You realize he's not trying to kill her, or he would have just shot her. I'm glad we didn't shoot that. We didn't need this scene. It was early in the process, anyway. I like the sound cut there, and going to this super quiet soundscape and city. This is one of the first locations I picked, and it was from David's sort of... Well, actually, I might have had it in a look-book or David had it in a look-book, but it's so iconic Berlin. And again, there's very little clean-up, digitally. I guess, some of the buildings in the background, there's a lot of modern. There wasn't much. You're as good as your reputation. And you love the sound of the creaking sign. Love it. And the watchtower over there. What do you call it? The Eye of Berlin? Is that what it is? No. I don't know. Can't remember. - Any sign of Bakhtin? - No. His old, retro computer there and a Watchman TV. - And her glasses. - Her sunglasses? I love it. We just went for '80s cool. Just go for it. - And why not? It was cool. - Yeah, I think so, having lived through it. They're like a tinderbox. If you find the right spark... Keep talking. I love it. So, that's actually in Ku'damm. That's the church there. And we made crazy use out of that. All our shoots in Berlin, our exteriors, we were really efficient in getting super-graphic, iconic stuff and setting up East and West. This is a repurposed shot from another scene that we cut out. I am interested in selling a watch. What are you selling? It is extremely valuable. "Full of secrets." I love it. I know and I thought it was just tongue-in-cheek enough. But the producers were like, "We don't like 'full of secrets.". And I'm like, "It's..." - This is great. - Yeah. Fuck yes, I mind. - I think you can almost see Til crack. - Yeah, he's cracking up. It's great. I love this crazy low angle. Yeah, you were always going, "Go further, longer, more." Just see. You're like, "No." - I would never say no, David. - Come on. No, you should. Sony. And again, this was a scene we could have used, basically, everywhere. And I think it works really well there to remind us of the club and her potential rendezvous with Sofia. Yeah. I mean, I just knew we'd use those little headphone scenes wherever, -so I'm glad we shot them. - Yes. Absolutely. I didn't think that you would show. I love the lighting of this scene. Stoli on the rocks? - We cut a lot of dialogue out of this, too. - A lot. Yeah. We just played with the looks, like, they're so good. I look for pleasure in the details. And also just, I love... Because sometimes, it's important to have that dialogue in the script, and it's even important to shoot it, just to get the looks you want. And then, in post, we can carve it out. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't mean that it was unnecessary in the script, or that it was unnecessary to shoot, but it did get us where we could actually remove it. - Right. - So, that's what I like. Everything you want is on the other side of fear. - We were gonna get that tattoo, right? - I know. Well, we still haven't. I know. - Kelly and I wanna get it, too. - Yeah. I mean, this scene is amazing and visually stunning. And it's really just like a three-wall set with some neon lights. And Jonathan Sela's lighting. And you're here because of the death of Gascoigne. - And the day cut behind them. - Yes. Nothing. But this was a concept that David, production designer, had for a while. Like, "This is what I want the bathroom to look like." It was one of the first art concepts and I'm like, "Awesome." Awesome. And we added a little ADR here to just show her vulnerability for the Sofia character and give us a plot point. And to give us right away the French Intelligence so we wouldn't... Clarify who she is. I got into this because it was exciting. Look at those tears. Well done. You should have become a poet. Or a rock star. - I think that every single day of my life. - Words to live by. No, but all of this was very straightforward in post. It just looks beautiful. And all the shots were really planned. This sort of continuous stuff into the love scene. The love scene choreography was really specific. There wasn't that much material, actually, really. So, it's like this dolly shot. Then this... The same dolly shot and then we're in, maybe like, one over in a different position, like that. - And the wide shot. - And the wide. - This one. With the reflection. - With the reflections, again, which I love. We had fun with this. It was always the plan to have that sort of, like... - Needle, needle... Yup. - Needle scratch. Nothing more. But sometimes, just holding your breath. - Yeah, it's like... - It's a needle scratch enough. Yeah, it was great. Did she have any information, Lorraine? And great tension score by Tyler. I love those hands with the Band-Aid. No manicured bullshit. It's like... She's doing dirty work. We were gonna play with what's being in the whisper, how much information is she gonna give. We knew this was a surreal motif when we did it. Yeah. And we cut out the scene where Percival is in the car listening, trying to hear what they're saying. David fucking Percival. All right, here's another instance where I'm like, "I'm gonna go shoot this quickly in the alley, him killing. -"Before set-ups, let's do it." - With an ice pick. We might need it. It wasn't in the script. I just felt like we might need some exposition. So glad we did it. And again, Tyler's score is great. We needed to get you a message, Lorraine. And I just love, also, the emotion of this, like, "Somethings going down. I'm not sure what." But you get the sense, like... I received your message. And the special effects transition. We actually cut out another smoking shot there at the Wall, remember? - We were told to. - Yeah, we were told to. That's quite a view. And I think they were right. Let's just go straight for it. It was great. We ended up creating a better shot. 40,000 Soviet-trained, heavily-armed frontier troops. All that, and 5,000 GDR citizens still had the brass balls to escape. God, he's so good. Right? He's so good. There, we did some ADR. No visual effects here, by the way. Practical. This is David, our production designer's, idea. We found this great parking lot. We took all the cars out. These buildings are real. We built the facade of the Wall. Real snow. Remember, we had the... It started to... - There were takes that are just like... - No snow. And then there were takes where it's covered in white. And we were worried, like, "How is this gonna hold?" But then, we just decided not to be worried and no one has complained. We had one group of producers complain for a bit. "That's gonna be confusing." I'm like, "It's the coldest city." - Sometimes, it snows. - It's the Atomic Blonde. Snow is blonde. Coming from Iceland, I know, snow can be really heavy and it's gone. That's just how snow behaves. In Iceland, at least. This newspaper thing was their instinct, to do it this way. - So good. - It's great. I hope you get a snapshot. Next week, this will be a whole different picture. This is just another, like, "Let's grab this. It's not in the script." "But just get her on the phone, dialing a number from the paper." - It's so funny. - Clue number one. - Kelly and I would... - Cue in Marilyn Manson. Sony. Kelly and I would, each night, check out the scenes we've done and think about all the holes that we have to fill because there are so many in a movie like this where the plot is so twisted. And we would figure out solves, like, "Okay, we get a scene here." "We can always have an editorial choice for that." And so, there was a lot of alts that Kelly and I came up with. Charlize always called me "The King of Alts" or whatever. And I'm like, "We need them." - But this was all done in pick-ups. - Yeah. - Somewhere in a backroom. - This whole scanning. No, that was backroom in the camera house the same day we did the sheet. And we printed those up on our printer at home. But the Chimney guys gave them a look and an effect. - Aged them down. - But they look real. How about his tank top? I wouldn't wear it, but it's okay for him. -"I wouldn't be caught dead in it." - Yeah, that was the line. - But for him, it's perfect. - Perfect. We had this crazy long shot where it went all the way through the club, and show all these amazing costumes that Cindy Evans had put together. It's just one of those things where you find it doesn't fit the movie anymore. But it was like a crazy entrance. Either way, we have to deal with Spyglass. There's a lot of ADR there. Come on! He's hardly the most trustworthy person I've ever met. And we, actually, turned it around for this scene. - So that we would end on... - Her. - On Spyglass. - Yeah. And we cut out to the... He's ready to make the jump. You believe he committed the entire thing to memory? Everything. Had I known earlier, I would have prioritized Spyglass. His knowledge made him as valuable as the list. I could have grabbed him at any moment. Here, we got mesmerized, again. Because the acting is so good. And I was thinking that Toby made this choice. "I gotta sit by the door. I'm gonna come back. I wanna show a passage of time." And I had this really strict blocking already in mind. And then I'm like, "Fine." I just, sometimes, have to go and let it go. - You make these choices... - No, it's perfect. We wanted to make her feel really vulnerable here. So, we took the takes where she's a little bit frustrated by his choices, -and feels like she's... - Pushed and cornered. Spyglass is my guy. We're going to do it my way. But again, it was a longer scene. We cut it down. We didn't cut so much out of this movie. We repurposed it or shortened it. - That's basically... - Right. Do we have a deal? - So, it was footage well spent. - Yeah. I'll take that as a yes. - I love that long-range shot. - Yeah, it's beautiful. You see, I received a call from David Percival that evening, Lorraine. Again, you just get drawn in. I'm sorry. It's like, "What's wrong with us?" Let's talk about it. People ask me, "What was the most difficult scene to shoot?" And I thought that the interrogation was actually the most difficult scene. Because I did have all the specific blocking with Jonathan Sela, and it was really like convincing the actors to trust in it. And then, also, collaborating with them for those little special moments. But all these moments were planned and then, obviously they got repurposed in editing. But actually, from here on out, they're kind of where they need to be, I think. And no one thought to tell me? - I love that laughter. - Yeah. Just subtle, subtle things. Fuck. You brought a lot of friends. I heard he slipped and fell on an ice pick. I think there is a good reason why we never see anyone drive into that alley. It's really difficult to drive into, right? It was hard to get the car into the alley. I don't know why he parks there all the time. Look, it's just the creativity of having not a lot of money. We're like, "We could shoot that scene here." - This is his, sort, of secret hideout. - Which is lovely. This is their apartment. We can repurpose it and shoot the scene here. Different angle. Different perspective. Percival's trying to set me up. Huge piece of ADR right there. Which just sort of hit home that he might not be an ally. Not really. I love that line, too. But, you know, I wrote that in post. Yeah, because... It was more like, "Why aren't they getting together?" "Is this a romance, or isn't it?" And then you just realize it's not. It's a friendship-ish thing. Why? But I mean, how can you not fall in love with those eyes, on both sides? Maybe, I just need... Or we all need a Jonathan Sela to light up our lives. It would be nice. It would be nice. So good. I love the color choices and the color palette. We've gone back to stark East Berlin. I love this subway. We had so many shots we were going to do and then it just sort of worked quickly in these three set-ups. - I love this. - It's perfect. This is actually one of the songs that changed the most. We tried so many different '80s tracks to take us back over to the East. I knew I wanted it to be a motif. - It was just more... - This is a good song. There was something we took out there and now I just can't remember what it was. - In terms of crossing over? - Yeah. I can't remember either. See, we didn't miss it. Exactly. Bingo. Again, we took out some dialogue there and kept Spyglass completely quiet, which is good. So, this was supposed to be Merkel, the character's hideout in the East, and where he has all the, sort of, punk rock kids working for him. Just, sort of, to color the world. Here's our stunt team Russians who were getting ready for the assassination. Speaking Russian. - Look at his face. It's so good. - Yeah, Eddie is great. Think my stunt team really delivered on the acting. - Yeah, I know. Absolutely. - Right? They all acted great. It should have been easy. The plan was sound. Whatever went wrong did so because someone wanted it to. Someone from the inside. It's funny that we're in this, sort of, political climate right now where all this lies, and truth and fake news... All of a sudden, this movie seems more relevant than when we were making it. Like, we grew up in that era. But not as extreme as it is now. They seem to be rooting for this era to come back. Politically. - It seems like it. - Someone needs a Cold War. - I'm ready. What do you think of his shirt? I wouldn't be caught dead in it. Stand over here. Now look like a free man. He's so empathetic. And he's an actor that can just transform. Every role he goes into, he disappears, becomes that guy. For me, that's the courage of actors. It's like, daring to go there. - Just to the honest part. - Right. It shines through. I realize I may not be valuable to some people... And I think, for all of them, they did. I had this interview with Charlize and I was saying... Somebody asked if directing action is the same as directing actors, and I said, "Yeah, it's pretty easy. You just look for truth." Like, when you see an action that's perfect, or compelling, you just move on. When you see a performance that's compelling and the truth comes out, you move on. - It's just like finding the truth. - Yeah. Beautiful. It's his family. This was not part of the plan. Part of mine. Look at them. Please. You just have to deal with Spyglass. I don't know if I have enough passports. "Your golden boy." So, in our expansive visual effects budget, this is our biggest visual effects shot. Michael, from Chimney, did an incredible job getting it to us. And it dovetails nicely into a drone shot right here. - It works. Looks good. - It works. We have to go. See you in the West. The tension... We had this, actually, cut to music for a second. It was to Fire Woman, for the longest time, from The Cult. And then we got some good notes, some constructive notes to just try go old school dramatic and then I think it works great. The tension, we're away from the music for a while, the stakes are getting bigger. And you really repurposed a bunch of things. We moved all these shots around several times to get... I love this. We had fun with the Russian thing. It's complicated, kids. - Russian is complicated if you don't speak it. - Yes. It was... Yeah. But we had the most helpful Russians around. Yeah. We did. And so, there's a shot here of Percival shooting her, which was also like a, "Okay, we may use it, we may not." "Do we wanna reveal that he's complicit? Is he..." It was funny. Early on in the script process, when James came on board, Percival wasn't complicit. He was a red herring in the third act. "And he just said, "You know, before I get there, just look at it. "Maybe it's better, if you're gonna spend all this time on my character, "make him more part of the third act." And he's like, "I'm not trying to get more screen time, I'm just saying," "that was my only bump in the script, and if you don't do it, great, whatever." And then he shows up and I had already made all the adjustments 'cause it was a huge revelation, like, "It's spy versus spy." And, that's again, like... Filmmaking is such this collaborative process and you don't know where the good ideas are gonna come from. - Come from anywhere. - They're airborne. - That's what I love about filmmaking. - Yeah. I don't want to die. You're not going to die. Stay here. My, my... So, here like... This is the stairwell shot that everyone has a million questions about. But first thing I wanna point out is, like, sound was huge. You hear the guys upstairs. We didn't have that in there for the longest time. And it was like, "Why is she going into the building?" And then you start to add their voices and you completely understand. There's a great transition. That's one of your first stitches right there. - That was visually fantastic. Very well done. - Visual effects. And so, a lot of these are just old-school edits. And you were on set and we would just match up. - Yeah, and that worked out great. - Yeah. We would cut it as we went. This is Greg, one of our stunt performers, choreographers. So, Charlize trained a lot for these pieces, like, we're talking weeks. And she also has an aptitude for it. Like, you can't do this with everybody. There's your first... That was a motion blur cut. Yeah. Yeah, I always forgot to count, myself. - That was one. - But there's a lot of them. - There's another... Another. - There's two. On a whip pan. - Another. - There's three. - Four. - There's four. So, again, on the motion blur, the roll we, you know... And those are all -not affected by visual effects. - No. - We had to erase some padding on the wall. - Yeah. So, to do this, you need your art department on board, your camera department. - Sam Hargrave is actually operating camera. - Yeah. - There's five. - Five, yeah. Tilt up. Jonathan had to figure out a lighting scheme -that would let us shoot all directions. - Yeah. There was a sixth. - And the CGI knife. - Yeah. - All right. - No, I mean... I'm just... It was such an experience to be on the set. - Everyone was so concentrated. - Right. - Again, just the amount of professionalism... - Seven. - Yup. - Yeah. And there... - My favorite part of the movie. - This is everyone's favorite. And so, even though we have the stairs padded, -like, to do that for 12 takes is not easy. - Yeah. No. And there we go again. Nine... - That's nine? - Yeah. Okay- So, this single shot, I've been wanting to do it for a long time, and it was like, Kelly, the creative producer, my wife, she had brought it up, she was like, "I really think you need something special in this film." "You know, we don't have a ton of money, but we want it to stand out." And she kept really challenging me, like, "What about the oner, what about the oner?" And I started to put it together. So, really, she brought it up. And then, I posed it to the stunt team, who... - Here's another one. - Yeah, that's a visual effect. And how many is that? Ten, now? - Ten... Eleven? - Ten? Well, I challenged the stunt team, and their first instinct was, like, "We try all the time, and then, the shots don't hold up," "and then, we just cut." And I'm like, "Well, let's try harder." There's another cut. And so, they spent four weeks on it, getting the pieces together... Yeah. Then we went to the actual location, and they rehearsed with a camera. And having Sam being able to operate, and Jonathan being okay with that was incredibly helpful. - Absolutely. -'Cause you can follow the choreography. They're the ones that rehearsed it, and we get something compelling. Yeah. And then, you have those great actors that understand the duration of it, -and how they get more and more worn out. - Yeah. It's amazing. There are so many cuts there. - There are two more. - I've lost count. - We're on, like, 14. - Yeah. - There's Cale. - Cale. 87Eleven office manager. No, but what I liked about this, and it was kind of inspired by the Children of Men sequence, is that you stay with the character. And I thought it was really important to stay with Lorraine at this point in the journey. There's another. And watch her go through this process. Like, we'd set it up in the beginning with all the bruises, like, "What the hell happened? What the hell happened?" And now, it's all paying off. Like, "That's why she has a black eye." -"That's why her back is bruised." - Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I think we're up to 18 cuts. - Nineteen. - Nineteen. It just pains me every time I see this. - Like, you just don't... Honestly... - Twenty... Charlize did an incredible job because you don't get this type of physicality out of most actors, and they won't go for it. No, but she is. But she went for it every day, and it was just -no complaining... We were like... - Take after take. Oh, God! "How do we make it better?" - But take after take after take, relentless. - Yeah. - Amazing. - Yeah. I love this so much. Yeah, and you're just like, man, the pressure to want to cut, the pressure to want to, like, go to something else, and I'm like, "Bold choices." Everything you want is on the other side of fear. - Yeah, just stay with it. - Yeah. And let 'em act it. - I love it. I love it. - Yeah. Everything feels so the same. But this is how I feel after a run. I do a jog around the house, and I'm right there with you. Yeah, we were gonna actually do this line in Russian. - Remember? - Her line here. - Yeah. - Yeah. Totally. Yeah. But the only Russian word I know now is suka. - And I guess... - It's actually... Yes... It means "bitch," right? I think it means "bitch" or something close to that. Look, that fight was done by the stunt team. I have a company, 87Eleven, with Chad Stahelski, and we've done choreography for years, and we've worked with a lot of great young stunt guys, and we've built a team of talented people that are going on to make their own stuff. And Sam, who has worked with us a lot, he'll be directing second unit as he, like, did on this, and he's gonna be directing films, I'm sure. - He's a talented kid. - Very. I have a great stunt team, and that's how you can get this type of action. There's a shorthand between us. Get in. Get in! And we keep with the oner. This is all visual effects-assisted edits from now on, through the car ride. Yeah. Yeah. But a lot of it is actually in camera, so we... Jonathan Sela wanted to really champion this part, and he's like, "What can we do?" This is all real. Yep.- Until Daniel pops back up, that's a plate. - Yeah. - Right? But this camera pan, like, we're inside the car on Doggicam, and we're on sort of a low-pro process rig... - There's an edit. - Yep. And then, the back of this was... - This is real. - This is real. Yeah. - Yeah. All in-camera. - Yep. - Still real. - Yeah. And then it transitions to a plate. - Yeah. There is a plate. Yeah. - Right? For the stunt. And I think, we would have tried to do the stunts in-camera, but we didn't have the money. Like, you really just needed to get the stunt right. Yeah. Fasten your seat belt. But, again, the stunt team delivered on, "You only have two cars to wreck." "Get the stunt right." - And they were great. - Yep. Domonkos, who was the stunt coordinator in Budapest, I'd worked with him on Troy many years ago. - There's the CGI car. - Yeah. I still love that. That was actually one of the guys from Budapest that did that stunt. - Yeah. - That pike. It's great. - The car? Yeah. - Yeah. - And this is CGI. - Yes, the comp shot. - I wouldn't believe it. - Half is Budapest, half is Berlin. Yeah. - I love this song on the radio. - Yeah. All right, so, Jonathan Sela thought we'd never use GoPro shots, but there's, like, three GoPro shots in there, right? We just laid a couple of GoPro cameras down, -just in case. - Yeah? - They came to good use there. - Yeah. And we didn't have a way to do a wide shot of the car going in the water, -so it had to be this impressionistic version. - Yeah. Just breathe! But this is all... - Real. - Shot in water. This was not even a shoot day. - It was a pre-shoot day. - Yeah. It's tests. Yes. Yeah. Underwater pre-shoot photography. I remember, yesterday, we were talking about on set on Dead pool, 'cause we were doing a water scene, and there was... I was talking about this where Eddie is underwater, and we're looking at him, and people are tapping me, like, "Cut! Say 'Cut!"' Like, "Say 'Cut!"' And I'm like, "He's holding his breath, he's fine." And they are like, "Say 'Cut!' He's going to die." I'm like, "He's acting. He's acting. "He's not gonna die. He's four feet underwater." "He can stand up." "Cut! Cut!" 'Cause when you see it, what you see is, like, -"Oh, my God. It looks scary." -"It looks scary." And then you realize he can stand up. Yeah. We did need to visually assist some of the makeup in her face. Remember? Yeah, the prosthetics were having a hard time holding up. - But look at this. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's, like, one of the first shots of the movie. - You need a break? - No. "No-II." So... Reflections again, the motif. Here's the camera angle where we're trying to get the power shift. It's like, we start high... from the moment my feet touched the ground. Now it's like, "But you knew that, didn't you?" But then you knew that, didn't you? The subtleties that they play are just amazing. Yeah. -"Ready when you are." - And... So, this music cue that's coming up, it's an incredible music cue, and Tyler, I beat him up over three months, trying to find a music cue for this section. You just get attached to this stuff. - And we had Under Pressure cut in here. - Yeah. Yeah. So, it was sort of a dichotomy, it was juxtaposed to the horrible thing that was happening, we're watching this sort of inspirational song, and we really loved it. But it did subvert the drama a little bit. And then we came up with this. Or Tyler did. And I love it. And we just live with the performances. And you are alive. They're all listening to me. - Look at her bloodshot eyes. - Yeah. The KGB knew everything. I need to get across. This is something we did discuss if we should take that out, but decided not to, because it gives the sense -of the world you were building there. - Yeah. I love it. And all the graphic titles... -lvar Edding did the design of. - Yeah, yeah. I also think it's like... It's an homage, it's a thumbs up to that. Yeah. It's like, this is the world they're living in. - Yeah. - Totally. - Yeah, I mean, the scenes are concise. - Yeah. And there's not that many setups in every scene. No. - Look at Mr. Blue Eyes. - Yeah. Not one with a photographic memory. Again, we're completely non-linear, -but for me, it doesn't feel like it. - Right. Because I think we're emotionally linear, -even though we're story-wise non-linear. - With her. Yeah. She made it out. Right. You know, a beautiful Italian girl once said to me, "David..." "You can't unfuck what has been fucked." "Women are always getting in the way of progress." I love it, and that's our feminist manifesto. - Yeah. He's gonna die. - He's gonna die. Sorry, you're gonna take a bullet, sir. But this is a scene we kind of... - And remember, we added... - Added the fireworks, which I love. Beautiful. - You can hear Tyler ripping a guitar. - But we kind of twisted... Because this was the beginning of the scene, and then she would go -and rampage the room... - Right. But I like the energy of going straight into that. And this is something we added in. - It helps. - Right. - That crazy upside down shot... - It's beautiful. was something that Jonathan and I had been talking about a long time, like, we were always playing with perspective. - Yeah. - And reflection. I just loved that moment of her world is upside down, and so we're upside down. It works perfectly. I now believe it was Percival who planted it. Made it look like Lasalle. I like, you can hear the reel-to-reel in the background. - Yeah. - In that scene, it just gets so quiet. I guess she ate some pizza, apparently. - The night before. - As you do, in Berlin. They have great pizza, apparently. Yeah, we really got the most use out of our sets. This hotel room is amazing. You need to leave Berlin. When I didn't hear from you, I got worried. How naive can you be? Pretty naive, apparently. This only ends one way. What are you talking about? I love the makeup. I love the gloves. Yeah, so '80s. Again, upside down. Yeah, we reversed this, right? Yeah, it was shot, like... Yeah. Yes? Don't underestimate me, Percival. Lasalle, listen to me very carefully. So much ADR. Yeah. Again another shot, where we're like, "We're gonna get you on the phone, we may need this." - And so... - Look at this. Because we really wanted to bleed into the music cue that we needed, and we wanted to repurpose some of this great footage we had, we created this... And you wanted some fades. You got fades. Yeah, exactly. I wanted some... That's turbo-fading. It's like, "Look at this." - Yeah, I wanted some dissolves. - It's so good. Yes, "dissolves." That's the word. - Yeah, from the '80s. - Yep. And show a passage of time, so we can get her in another outfit, as you do. There's a reason for every single scene and cut in this movie. - Right. - Yes. Costume change. Percival's trying to set me up. And this was an empty frame before Percival walks into it to answer the door. We just put some visual effects on it. When you tell the truth, you look different. Again, the soundscape helping us tell the story, like, he'd been tracking her, recording her stuff. Are there tapes? There are tapes. And then, we just put the table of evidence. "Which is like, "Which piece of evidence "will we end up focusing on when we're finished post?" Got his cast. We got the wire. We got Bakhtin's gun. What more do you need? Guilty! - But... - It's cool. Yeah, because the movie had so many twists and turns, you just didn't know what you were gonna need. So... This was actually a long Steadicam shot that didn't cut for... Then, we cut it into three pieces. This was the rehearsal where he walked in. We thought that at the end of the day it was creepier that... Also, we like to use the shock when she was looking around. It gave her a purpose, like, walking there instead of... This song was in the script from my first pass of the script with Kurt, like, it was one of the first needle drops I wanted in it. It was like this Coen brothers fight that I had in mind juxtaposed to the song. I love this scene so much there. It gets me every time. Every single time. Just“. That, my friend, is good action acting, like, how he reacts to that knife in the back. It's good. Everyone celebrating on the street right now. Open the door. I'm sorry, darling. This is the game. -"This is the game." -"This is the game." No, Lorraine, save her! We went back and forth between, is it gonna be source? Is it gonna be score? But source is better. It's sad. Makes it so raw. That's crazy, yikes. Who directed this? So, this was a really incredible performance by Charlize. Overall, again, everything, but having this moment of complete breakdown and measuring it in the right way. Understanding the arc of the character and building it just enough to where... It's not too emotional for a spy but it is emotional enough where we can actually now... She's cracked the veneer of... I get her. I believe her, yeah. And this hand-held last-second shot of this emotional moment. This is one of my favorite shots in the movie and it's right when the camera's rolling out. There's only four frames after that. We were gonna open the movie with him and the TV and setting up Berlin, and the wall's coming down. Look at this shot. So, this is the final payoff of the reflection motif. It's like kitchen table. Yeah, and it was something that I had to pitch Charlize on. 'Cause she was like, "I don't wanna... Why would I be sitting on the floor?" I'm like, "It's all about the reflection." "We have a reflection shot coming up." But sometimes you need that. You just say, "I'm paying off a motif that's important to the bigger picture," and she got it. She totally got it. And what was the fucking game anyway? So this is a breaking of the fourth wall. Like I said, opening of the movie, he was gonna be lighting his apartment on fire seeing the wall burn down, hearing about... Hearing Kurt Loder talk about the wall. And we repurposed it at the end. We were gonna just cut it out at some point, right? What, the sampling thing? No, this whole thing. I think. At one point... I'm so happy you didn't tell me about that. - You were gonna cut it out, at one point. - What? No. No. No. Early on, because it was at the beginning. - Yeah, yeah. - Then, it didn't work and we didn't know where it was gonna live, and I loved it so much, I'm like, "Where could it work?" But we were gonna do it in a different way at the end. Then, we kept it in a stylish way, here. Something like this. I like that. I think it pays off there, breaking the fourth wall. - And look... - Yeah, I love it here. And I love all these shots. Once again, one piece of set wall, great lighting, some real fireworks, and slow-mo. - Exactly. - That's it. - And great actors. - And great actors. Back to our alley. That you cannot drive in or out of. But this is the movie magic, I love it. Somebody knifed his tires. "...that list has power." "...another fucking target." Yeah, it sort of wraps up a lot of... One last goodbye to Lasalle. Lasalle was helping her all along. And it is paying off the whole existential crisis of the spy. That's why I wanted to start the movie on it, but it actually works so much better at the end. It does. Look at that gun. I fucking love Berlin! Again, I get dragged into the movie. That's great. She is such a star. This is an amazing scene. And just calling each other for what they are. Just watching them, how much they put into... There's so much work behind this. They work hard. And it shows in the best way possible. ends up fucking dead? You gave Bremovych the details of the plan. You went to the KGB to take me out. Again, I'm just... l forget to talk. I get completely... Yes. If those KGB pricks had done their part, I'd be on my way to a hand job with the Queen by now. Just, also, the dialogue is so funny. Yes, he gave us the "hand job by the Queen" improv, which is amazing. That's a favorite. It turns out, you've been a very naughty girl. I love this scene. "Truth, lies, people like us don't know the difference." "Of course we do. We just choose to ignore it." So the question is, is it en route to MI6? Or is he selling it to the Russians, or... Why are you hurting him? We'll find out. It's on his wrist. What was Percival gonna do with the list? He was gonna send it to MI6. Yeah, or was he gonna sell it? No. You think so? No, I don't think so. But I like that we left it open-ended enough. No, but I seriously believe -he's a true patriot. - No, he's... I agree. And that she was smarter and just said, "Look, this is the way it goes." "You're a patriot. Sometimes you... Collateral damage." The greater war. That's always how I felt. But there's another way to read it. You could read that he was gonna be dirty anyway, and she had to frame him, no matter what. And hopefully you're not sure, as audience, at this point. Hopefully you're still... But I think you realize when you understand that she set him up. - Right, exactly. - This is again... Love the setup here, how you draw the frame, and shoot it. Thank you. Such a simple scene, like two coffins in a plane, -but it just looks like a painting. - Yeah, it tells you a lot. - It's like... - No, I just... This movie just lended itself to that sequence there. Again, look at the reflection. Two-faced bitch. And I like you, a lot. The duplicity of... "My superior." of her character. "My superior." "I could kill you with that ashtray." -"Twice." - Yes. I did my job. Despite your best efforts and your incompetence... "...incompetence." I succeeded where you failed. I uncovered your traitor, Satchel. There is a little editorial magic. I mean, we had that long push in for that thing, and then we ended up using a lot of pieces. Yeah, because what we were trying to achieve, and I think we got there, was... As it was scripted, we got the whole thing about Percival and stuff after she killed him. But we needed something so we would root for her. So we would feel that she was competing with Percival, almost. So we moved everything about her suspicion about Percival, we moved it up earlier. So yeah, it was a bit of a patchwork. Then again, with amazing performances, -and setups and coverage. - Yeah. You covered that really well. I just knew the story at some point was gonna be perfected in post, like it always is, but even more so, because of all of the twists and turns. And what was gonna be clear and what wasn't, and what was gonna really stick. When you read the script, there were so many details that you had to follow. It was like reading a novel as opposed to reading a script. We're choosing to bury this one, Broughton. Your mission never took place. This conversation... And then at post, it was like a bit of a balance act to figure out, what are we following? Are we following the logic of the story, or the emotional journey? Or to find balance between the two? Yeah, for sure. Look at that face. I love this moment. At some point, everyone wanted to end on this. - This would be the final. - And you could. You could've ended the movie right here. Even in one of the test screenings, the first one, people started to just get up. We had to lower the music so people would realize it's not quite the end. - And I think we trimmed this shot a little bit. - Yeah, we did. But I'm glad we didn't, because this leads us to a better setup for, if there are future films about who she is. And then, the third reveal of the CIA. Come on. Yeah, and I love the idea that she is a ruthless double, triple agent. Why not? I love it. It's a great story. A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. That is true. Again, a lot of dialogue out from this scene. - But we did not need it. - Yes. We repurposed a lot of... We got the subtitles really clean. Just this really specific information. And this idea that we filled some, answered some questions, -like, "I thought you were gonna kill me." - Yeah, yeah. This is all ADR, all this dialogue. Except this here... I think he is seriously star-struck. He should be. He should be. She is amazing. And the brilliance of having Percival -get back at her. - Get back at her, yes. From the grave, "Percival told me who you are." That's really good. This is a last minute idea, step on the plastic. I just wanted to make it feel scaly, as opposed to they all just come in to... And it is a classic trope. "Lay on the plastic." "Be professional." I like that. "Be professional. Just get on the plastic." And... I'm like, "We need some rubber gloves on set." "All we have are these kitchen gloves." I'm like, "Perfect." - They're in a hotel, it'll be great. - We'll use those. We'll use those. This was difficult to... Because you shot all of it slow-mo which is brilliant, and then we ramped it up. But it's not constant, like we speed up and slow down and speed up... It's just funny. I'm still learning. Trying to control and keep control on how things slow down and speed up, and where they speed up. Especially when it's going between departments. - It's funny how difficult it actually becomes. - Yeah. But the result is amazing. I love it. You can see it in his face. - The idea... - And the lipstick. Adding some lipstick. This whole scene, this is Charlize doing the action, -and she's incredible. - Absolutely. And we changed it all on the day and she learned it in five minutes. It's a single camera move with the stunt... With Sam operating which was great. Just stunning. In terms of the action, I was always trying to build it with the tone of the movie. So this is sort of an homage to John Woo. Before you die, I want to get this through your thick, primitive skull. I never worked for you. I wrote that line, too. "Thick, primitive skull." Every false intel I gave you, a rip in the Iron Curtain. No, this is an execution scene I like. - It is just so ruthless and brutal. - Yes, it's so brutal. - Yeah, whatever. - And blood on the lens. That was back and forth, though. Yeah, and we had a couple of other times where there was blood on the lens. Reflection again. "Time to clean up the mess. Get up there." So this was Charlize's idea, and we had a lot more moments inside of the elevator to take off the wig. And I thought it was a really good idea, needing this cathartic moment for her. It's over. I mean, look at her. Like... - Yeah, amazing. - Amazing. You shot a lot of her getting out of the hotel, meeting Til in the foyer... Yeah, there's a whole exit to this music. But at this point, it's almost a second ending. - It was time, right? "Just get on with it"? - Yeah, just get on with it. Also just to be able to spend some time here because it looks amazing, walking to the airplane. Yeah, so this was atmosphere that happened on the day, beautiful accident. We got fogged in. And thank God, 'cause we couldn't have afforded to make that fog. Who is that? There's my cameo, "Estimated flight time to Langley." That sounds good. - And again, a lot of dialogue out. - Yeah. "Cocksucker?" I'm glad it was convincing. Okay, don't sing along. Yeah, don't sing along. I just wanna stand up and go like... But we can't. Yeah. That was a fun movie. We've watched it so many times. But just the journey with all those people there, it's amazing. Hands down, my best film experience by far. I'm not gonna go all Trump-cabinet on you, but I'm so honored to have worked as your editor on this movie -and Wick, and... - Thank you. I'm honored to work with you. Thank you. You just read through this like, "Oh, my gosh." I could go on and on 'cause everyone played a significant part. And just Budapest, how everyone was so welcoming, and helpful and assisting... Can we shoot another movie in Budapest? I'd love to. Talented crews. Our art department was amazing. - And Ian, Payroll. Thank you, Ian. - Our production department was amazing. Absolutely, my man. My man in Budapest. Mark Hyde, key grip- - He delivered tenfold. He's back with us. - Yep. It's so good. I almost get tears in my eyes just looking at this credit list. And it's the perfect song for the ending. Yeah, I'm sold now. I wasn't, but it's also because I loved it where it was. It could've worked in the other place. But this is cooperation. You have to listen to other people, take it in, and they were right. - It's okay. - Yes, they were right. It hurts, but it's okay. - It does. - Not being right all the time. It can hurt. - Or not. It's healthy. - Yeah. Mary Vernieu, incredible casting agent. Marisol, who works with her. They got us such great actors. - And Matt Absher. - Where is... He is earlier. We missed it, but he is not to be missed. No. Like, post, everything. There he is right there. There he is, first assistant editor. - Amazing. There's one... - Mark Stoeckinger. Incredible, we transformed the sound landscape. Todd Harris, storyboard artist, who doesn't get a credit on here because we've missed it. Anyway, long and short, he's invaluable. I work with him all the time and he's one of my creative partners. He didn't come with us but in the beginning, in the setup, he was crucial. - Bobbing our heads to Tyler's music. - It's so difficult, lvar Edding, title design. They were so fun and so creative. They went with all my wacky ideas and delivered tenfold on 'em. It was great. - And always smiling. - Always smiling. Never agitated, never irritated. They're like, "What? Spray paint? Let's do it." "Let's do it." Let's make some elements in the parking lot. - I think they had great fun with it. - Yeah. A lot of my friends from Berlin, 'cause I've done so many movies there. It was great, even though we were only there for less than a week or a week, it was good to see them all. You didn't allow me to come with you to Berlin. You didn't come? No, I was still in Budapest. - You were working. Yeah. - Yeah. I had things to do. Yes, you had to make the movie. You had to make the movie. Well, that's an overstatement, but thank you. - It's just... Yeah. - Leo Plank, Uli Nefzer, Florian, yes. All guys that I love so much. Like I say, I get emotional. Yeah, it's great. Just reading the credit list. Thank you to Sierra Pictures, Nick Meyer, for making this all happen, selling it. Roger, music editor. Kosteck, yes. Tyler! Tyler. There's your album. Apparently, they're making a vinyl and a CD. - Yes. - Lovely. So they'll have them hopefully at the premiere. We can check 'em out. Thanks, guys, for listening. That was the director's commentary. Hope you enjoyed it and we didn't bore you too much. - All right, thank you. - Thank you, bye-bye, enjoy.
