Once Before Hey, Gabriel, what is up with you? I'm going to be late. Don't go to work today. I can't. We have a presentation later. Let them do it. Are you crazy? I have to be there. -Okay, I know. -What? I'll go with you. No way. What's wrong with you? I'm bored out of my mind in here. I miss working. I miss Dennis. You owe me a lot. I'll make it up to you. Okay. I know how. Wear this. Why? Please? I just want to see you in it again. Gabriel, I'm going to be late and you're being weird. I love you. I love you more. I'm always gonna be here. I know. Come on. I'm running late. Help me slip out of it. Hurry! Thank you. I thought of some things for that script we're working on. Can we talk about that when I get home from work? What if Willy cheats on Mae? So, in the middle of the story, Mae will leave Willy. Gabriel, I think we can talk about that later. Willy can't move on. Gabriel, every film is always about the main character who can't move on. Yeah? Let's work on it later. Love you. Love you. Well, Gabriel is right. Who can move on so easily? Other tenants who live here wanted to evict Donita. 'Cause one time she set her ex's things on fire. She almost burned down the entire building. Hi! You have such a cute dog! Thank you! Bye! Take care! Filipinos don't know how to move on. We don't want to be left behind, and we don't want to be the one to leave either. Don't we just take forever to say goodbye? We keep saying we're leaving, but we never do. Like broken record players stuck on the same word. Every Valentine's Day, he'd be there. The place where he met his wife, who cheated on him and left him for someone else. Who moves on ever, really? Half the population of this country has not moved on. We should have a contest for the broken-hearted. The first one to move on wins. Mom, too. When Daddy died, I told her... "Mommy, you have to move on." And she did try. Tried to kill herself. Good thing I'd been there on time. Even my Grandma Cindy doesn't seem to have the words "moving on" in her vocabulary. She mourned my Grandpa Ciso for five years. You'd find her dressed in black at the cemetery every single day. One day, Grandma Cindy never came home. We spent the day looking for her. She was gone by the time we found her at the cemetery. She was lying on Grandpa Ciso's grave. She really did love him to death. Dennis, my best friend, isn't a big fan of things like that. He believes when a relationship has run its course, it's over. Forever is a lie. What about our friendship? We've been best friends since we were snotty-faced grade-schoolers, cheating off of each other's quizzes. That's different. It's different between us. You're a meanie. What? Don't you like it? Dennis is who I run to when I'm sad, or bored, or confused, and when I'm full of joy. Besh! Gabs! Come in. Guess what? Won't you please join me in my happiness. Wait, hold up. What's going on? I have met the one person I will love forever. I've met the one! I've met him! You say "forever," but you just met. That's exactly why I hate Tagalog movies. -So corny. -Yeah. Whatever happens, the couple always ends up together. Not realistic at all. They think we're that gullible. Excuse me, Mr. Half-baked Critic. What's wrong with happy endings? And excuse me, not all Filipino films are like you say. I personally prefer a happy ending. It's more fun. Why? In real life, do all couples end up happily ever after? That's why it's a movie, right? It's just make-believe. Okay. So you mean to say... Because it's make-believe, it doesn't have to be true? That's what "make-believe" means. I think you're saying that because you've never had your heart broken. Well, you're right. You, however, look like you've had your heart broken many times. Gabby, we should go. Wait. Your name is Gabby? Yes. What's the matter, Mr. Half-baked Critic? Have a comment about my name, too? You're the one who commented on my comments. Gabby, come on. We're going to be late. What are the chances in a million years that you'll meet someone who has the same name as you? As in... Alex, Alex. Billy, Billy. Badong, Badang. I mean... Right? Yes, Miss Happy Ending, don't you know it's rude to stare? Why? Do you think I'm attractive? Yes. Problem? Is it wrong for a girl to find a man attractive? Hey! Be happy for me! Besh! -I'm happy! -This is it! I knew it. I knew this day would come. On our first date, we decided that everyone should call him Gabriel. I didn't like it. The lead's an asshole. You don't have to like the main character. How will I identify with him, then? You don't need to. Unsympathetic leads are preferred these days. If I ever write a film, that's what I'm going to do. And then I'll kill the lead in the end. Nobody will watch that. Even you? Nope. I didn't pay for a ticket so I could cry. I will never make you cry. You better make sure. So, have you watched it? Yeah. Didn't we say we wouldn't watch movies alone? Who was I supposed to watch it with? My best friend was busy. You're upset with me. He's upset. -No, I'm not. -My best friend is upset with me. My best friend is upset. -Besh is upset! -I'm not! -Don't be upset anymore. -I told you I'm not upset. This is our theme song. Never ever say goodbye. It means we will never say goodbye to each other. Whatever happens, nothing will ever keep us apart. Never ever say goodbye. I've tried it! Gabs? I've surrendered it. -I've given it all up! -What? Wait, wait. What do you mean? Well... Gabriel and I, we... You what? We had sex. We had sex. We had sex. Besh! You're my bestest friend out of all my best friends. The best! The best! And I have another piece of news. What is it? Well... I'm going to move in with him. Wait, Gabs. Aren't you going too fast? No "Wait, let's take it slow" phase? Nothing like that? So this is how it happened... They say your boyfriend should also be your best friend. For the relationship to work. In my case, my best friend and my boyfriend are two different people. I love both of them in different ways. Gabriel recommended me and Dennis to Ma'am Louise. Because he is her favorite. -Very good, Gabriel. You are so amazing! -For her, Gabriel can do no wrong. The three of us share one dream. To someday leave advertising and become filmmakers. We are going to make films that will astound the world. I'm telling you. In two to three years, I'm gonna make sure I'm gonna quit. So I can finally make a film like I promised Grandma Cindy. Why wait two to three years? Let's make it happen this year. Are you in a hurry, mister? Let me handle it. This year, we're going to make a film... and lots of babies. Silly, did you just say "babies"? But I promise. I want to do everything I can to make your dreams come true. Our dreams. Try this. It's good. Gabby? I have a question. But... You have to promise me your answer will be "yes." You haven't even asked the question. Oh, my God. What is this? Will you marry me? Yes. -Yeah? -Yes! You're making so much noise. Sorry! Yes! Yes! -Go on. Put it on my finger. -Sorry. -Does it fit? -Yes! You crazy man. Do you like ice cream? Yeah, it's good. I love ice cream. -Hi, besh! -Hey, Gabs! -Hello! -How are you? Gabs, this is Marian. She's a professor in UP. Marian, Gabs. Nice to meet you. Sit down. -Join us. -Okay. I'm so glad to finally meet you. You're so lucky you snagged my best friend. You make me sound like a cotton fruit. You'll never find anyone like him so take good care of this guy. He's a grown man. He can take care of himself. We're very independent with each other. I allow her her dreams and she allows me mine. I told him, if he wants to quit advertising and go into filmmaking, I'll support him. But we need to save first. We don't have capital yet. But someday we will. That's your plan too, right, Gabs? I'm gonna quit soon. But it's been three years and I can't seem to bring myself to resign. -You can do it. -Hi, Besh. Hello! So, are you ready? "My Super Hero." Are you tired of costly and ineffective skin whitening soaps? Don't lose hope. Because a new scientific breakthrough in skin lightening is coming. In just 14 days, you can get fairer, refreshed, and beautiful skin. The new SafeWhite Soap by The Beauty Laboratory. It's the new advanced discovery of all existing soap-- Why is your presentation so cheesy, Dennis? Is it cheese you're selling? Ma'am... God! I miss Gabriel! Back to the drawing board. That's Ma'am Louise's favorite expression. "Back to the drawing board." Hello? Marian? All right. Okay. Later. All right. Excuse me. -Hey. -Hi, babe. -How are you? -Hi. Well, as usual... Our presentation got rejected again. And Ma'am Louise sang your praises. Says she misses you. Poor Dennis. But this... Now that's heaven. My favorite. But anyways, as I was saying this morning, going back to our story... Willy is about to go blind. They won't end up together. They will separate. For the ending, just by chance, they'll be in the same place. At the bus station. But... But Willy won't see Mae because he'd still be blind. That's it? What about Mae? Won't she see Willy? About Mae. She's already married to someone else by then. So even if she does see him, she won't approach him. What she will do is... She'll just look at Willy. Thinking about... all the thoughts that could have been. That's so painful. Didn't I tell you I always want happy endings? You write that. Okay, Ma'am. As you say, Ma'am. -You win, Miss Happy Ending. -It's your fault. Babe... I really want to quit. I'm sick of this. I'm sick of trying to convince the whole country to buy a product that even I... don't use. My favorite part of Gabriel's body are his hands. I find his fingers very sexy. When his arms are wrapped around me... I feel safe in the world. Gabs... Can you please let me go with you this time? -Please? -Gabriel... Fine. Yes! But we need to hurry. We need to be quick or we'll be late. They won't notice me, I swear. -I'll just watch them. -You promise? I miss the office! I miss Ma'am Louise. Even Dennis. I miss that friend of yours. -Come on. I'm going to be late. -Okay. -Hi, Besh. -Hey, Gabs. -How are you? -Did you make the revisions? Yes. But... I was a bit distracted. Marian and I had another fight. You never learn. Us girls need some time. Don't worry. We can do this. I really miss Gabriel in times like these. He's the best pitcher in the world. He can sell anything. I know. I'll just go get my laptop. All right. See you later. Do you feel it got colder? The air conditioner's turned up so high. Let's go. We quarreled that night. He didn't want to invite his father to our wedding. They'd always been at odds, you see. He just wanted his brother and his mother there. For me, he's still his father no matter what. But he said it was his decision. That's my final decision. My dad's not coming to our wedding. So I don't get a say in it? I walked out on him. Yes, yes, I'll be right down. -Besh, I'll just be here. -Gabs. I don't want to go home. Geez, Gabs. Just when you're about to get married, you keep having these fights. Gabriel's calling. Answer the phone. Poor guy. Babe, answer my call. I knew he was coming to take me home, but I still didn't want to talk to him. Gabs... Please answer. Hey. Gabs, please. Answer my call. Babe-- Go find them. He didn't want to tell you. Said it was a surprise. He'd been saving up. For your movie. Breakfast? Are you real? Can I really touch you? Am I going crazy? It's just going to be the two of us from now on. Forever. This is our storyboard for the campaign of stopping animal abuse. Are you serious about this? Yes, Ma'am. Is there a problem? I don't think people will be able to relate to this. I see him looking at the people he loved when he was still alive Objects he owned and used... But I am the only one he can touch. Well, it's not catchy for me. Back to the drawing board. What happened? Nothing, she hates the name of the pig in my storyboard. I miss you guys. All right, Gabs. Where are we off to? You'll see. Okay. -Okay, here. -Gabs... why are we going in there? Well, you told me you wanted to do the things we used to do back then, so I was thinking we should try it. I don't know... Why? Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Please? Let's just give it a try. Okay? -Here we are. Let's just try it. -Come in. I want to get my fortune told. You did not come alone. I do not see him, but... I can sense him. I can sense his sadness. -Gabby, let's go. Please. -All right, then. Wait... He cannot cross over. He doesn't want to. What are you talking about? You don't know what you're talking about. Your situation is not a joke. I pity you. You need to cross over. Because the world of the living should never mix... with that of the dead. You can't stay here forever. You need to cross over. Gab, we're leaving. Even if you run, you can't escape the truth. Hi, Mom! Babe! You still haven't worn that dress I gave you. It's too loud, mom. The colors clash. Loud? It's better than you wearing Gabriel's clothes all the time. You look haggard. Mommy has finally moved on from Daddy's death. But she might have overdone it. She became somewhat of an environmentalist. She loves flowers. She goes through a lot of boyfriends, damaged, ridden with issues. Never lasts long. Babe, why don't you come live with me here again? Mom... I'm okay. Do I have to spell it out to everyone? Because you're not okay. It will be better than you sulking in Gabriel's condo. It's more than a year. You need to move on. Did I lose my chance to have a grandchild? Mom! You have a beautiful garden. How long have you been tending to this? You take such good care of it. It shows... Babe. Don't change the topic. Did Dennis put you up to this? Come, let's sit. Let's go tour Europe. It will be my treat. Let's go to Lourdes. I think you need a break. Mom, I'm fine. Okay? I'm content. -Hey! -Hi! Hi, guys! So we've decided to do the brainstorming here for our presentation on Monday. If that's okay with you. Yeah, that's cool. I'm okay with it. -Okay, come in. -Really? Great! Let's go. I'll just put it here. I miss how we used to do this with Gabriel. Nothing much changed. I can still pick up Gabriel's scent around here. -You're right. -Right? What do you want to eat? We can have it delivered. -Yeah. -This is good. You don't have to keep my mind off things. I'm fine. We just want to be with you. -Let's try to cheer you up. -He's right. We miss jamming with you on overnights. That's true. Overnight? Come on. We're already here, Gabs. You can't chase us off. Plus, we have to finish that deck by Monday. Remember we have a deadline. -Yeah, we need to finish the deadline. -See? -Let's get started. -Let's go. Who wants pizza? -I got one. -Okay, have it all done. -I'll just get something inside. -Okay. Can't we indulge them this time? Just this once. They might suspect if I turn them down. I mean, I guess. As long as they don't sleep here. Not likely. We'll be working. What are you going to do? I'll just step out. I'll go for a walk. Are you sure you're okay? I mean, I have no choice. Gabs? Are you talking to someone? How would I be talking to someone? This is so good. Gabs. I feel like you should move to a new place. I'm a bit concerned about you staying here. Stop worrying about me. I'm okay, Besh. Can we eat first before we start working 'cause... -I'll get that. -...I'm really starving. Here you go. Thank you. This is good, I like this one. Here, here. -Let's put it here. All right! -Thank you. -It's good. -Let me have it. -Here. Let me. -There you go. Thank you. This is good. Cheers. Here you go. We have this very rarely. Here you go. It's the best, try it. You disappoint me! You're just like your brother. You're both useless! What about you, Dad? What good ever came out of you being a mayor, huh? -Nothing. -Danny. Instead of helping your constituents, you steal from them. -Danny-- -You are a thief! -Danny! -You are a thief-- That is enough! That is enough! You better discipline your son. He seems to take after his insolent brother! Danny... Imelda, leave him be. What is wrong with you? Have you been dead long? Three years now. From drowning. What about you? Car accident. It's been two years. Why are you still here? I don't want to go. I can't bear to leave my family. My child is always looking for me. He can't sleep. I used to be the one to put him to sleep. Can they see you? No. Why would I let them see me? I tried to embrace them once before, but... I really couldn't. The best I can do... is watch over them. Different aspects of love through different kinds of animals during Valentine's Day. Because, as they say, a person's love takes on many aspects. Like a dog... that can get clingy. No dignity. The second loves like a lion. A fierce kind of lover. Some are like gentle sheep, who do nothing but obey their herdsman. And next, we have the cat. Full of pride. No matter what you do, you'll never get them to confess. And of course, last but not the least... People who love like turtles. No matter how long they've been together, they still can't bring themselves to confess their feelings. That's wonderful! -Thank you, Ma'am. -It makes me want to fall in love. Good job, Dennis. Congrats, guys! -Thank you! -Thank you, Ma'am. By the way, Marian's waiting for you outside. Congrats! Congrats, team! Besh! Congrats! Thanks, besh. I am so glad you mentioned Gabriel's old concept. It worked! Aren't you two sweet. Don't tell me you're jealous. Why not? Don't I have a reason to be? Gabs, that was my idea. He does nothing but steal my ideas. Gabriel, you won't be able to use them now anyway. And I was the one who told him to use it. Why are you defending him? He always liked you. He's just waiting for an opportunity, Gabs. Gabriel... Dennis is my best friend. Yeah. A best friend who is waiting for a chance. What? Gabriel, you're probably forgetting that Dennis has a girlfriend. And, what-- You've been gone a year now, right? So if he's really into me, he would've said earlier. You see? You really are defending him. Can you not, Gabriel? I don't know what to say. Do you still love me? Oh, my God. You know... I can't have this conversation with you. You're just being ridiculous. Babe. Babe. Wake up. It's our anniversary. Happy anniversary. What do you wanna do? Wake up. -Dennis. -Are you okay? -You'll come to work? -I'm okay. -I'm okay, I promise. What? -Are you sure? I'm not coming in to work today. Dennis. Don't you remember? It's our anniversary. -I promise I'm okay. -Are you sure? -All right, take care. Bye. -Okay, bye. He's annoying. Hold on. Let's take a selfie. This feels nice, doesn't it? Hey. I hope you don't mind. My name is Travis. Gabs. His name is Travis. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver. He might be sick in the head, too. Do you come here often? Actually, I know the owner of this place. As a matter of fact... He's selling me this resort. I'm still thinking about it. Don't you, like... Is it a good investment for me? This guy's a show-off. Show-off! Something funny? Nothing. Sorry, sorry. What were you saying? As I was saying... This is me. I invest and invest. Papa's actually calling me out for it. I think his father's an old braggart, too. -What if I flick his nose? -Hey! Don't. Don't be mean. Who are you talking to? No one. Why? -Nice meeting you. -Nice to meet you. My God. You're so mean. You know what? I'll just finish this at home. I have a lot on my plate right now. Yeah. Come on. -Okay. Bye. See you. -I'll catch up. Hey, Besh. -You didn't go home yet? -Gabs. Can you stay for a while? There's something I want to tell you. Okay... I handed in my resignation. Earlier. Effective next week. Gabs, we keep planning to resign... but we never actually do it. Do you remember... our first day at work? We used to dream a lot. You, me, and Gabriel. We used to dream that some day we would make a film that would astound the world. Yeah... And, Gabs... I met a film producer. A friend of Dad's. And he said he's willing to listen to our pitch. Gabs. This is it. The chance we've been waiting for, for so long! Our dream! Maybe... Maybe we can even collaborate on the script. Or maybe even co-direct. But, Besh, I don't think you needed to resign. It's time, Gabs. Come on. Let's just admit that I'm not really good at this job. And the truth is... My parents are asking me to migrate to Canada. I told them I didn't want to. But you know what? It actually made me think... That it's time I pursued what I want seriously. Well... I'm happy for you. To pursue what I want... whom I want. And, Gabs, I want you. Gabs, wait. I know you're thinking of Marian. I know that I will be so unfair to her. But I won't be able to forgive myself if I didn't own up to the truth. The truth is, Gabs, I love you. When Gabriel was still alive... I would always watch the two of you. You were so happy together. And during the night, I would always imagine, what if... What if I was Gabriel? What if I was the guy who was taking care of you? The one loving you. Then he died. And, Gabs, every day I see how lonely you are. How alone you are. And I would always imagine coming up to you, and being the one by your side. Gabs... I don't want to be just your best friend. Let me be Gabriel for you, Gabs. I chose to do nothing out of respect for his memory. Gabs... It's time we faced the truth. Dennis... Gabs, please. I don't want to be just your best friend. You have a girlfriend. It's over between us. I have a boyfriend. He's dead. Gabs, please. Forget about Gabriel. Allow yourself to love again. Allow yourself to be happy again. Why? What makes you think I'm not happy? I'm sorry. You know... Just leave me alone. Have some respect for Marian and Gabriel. Gabs. Hi. Working late? Jamming concepts. You know how our job is. And you were with Dennis? Gabriel, please. I'm tired. Is that why I can't go with you? Is there another reason? Gabriel. I'm asking you. We would have fights like this back then. He would get jealous over nothing. Is Dennis the reason? It just keeps happening over and over. I always knew he had feelings for you. Gabriel... Why do you do this to yourself? You have no reason to be jealous. I know. It's just... I can't compete with a living person. You don't have to compete. Okay? You're the one I want. I love you. Okay? But it was only the beginning. Our fights became more and more frequent. As if our unresolved issues from before were coming back to haunt us. Only worse. He watched my every move. Every word I said he misinterpreted to justify his jealousy. He kept coming up with reasons why he was scared I'd leave him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. -Gabs! -Dennis. -Gabs, I have good news. -What are you doing here? Okay, so, Daddy's friend backed out but I found a new one. I pitched your concept to Viva, and sorry if I didn't ask for your permission first, but it worked. They liked it. They said they're interested to listen to our storyline. Maybe if you're free tonight, we can brainstorm? -Dennis... -Gabs, please. Please say yes. This is the chance we've been waiting for. And, Gabs, I'm sure if Gabriel were alive right now, he would be happy for us. Gabs, please. Just for a few hours. We just need to brainstorm. Okay. -Okay? Let's go. -Yeah. Okay, let's go. Maybe we can have like two parallel stories in one. One is a love story between Mae and Willy, and the rival would be Donald. And the other is a love story between Donald and Mae, and Willy would be the rival. Right? So we have two love stories in one. Well, that's a good idea. I'm cool with two love stories. But we can tweak the story a little bit. I feel like the story should be about Willy and Mae, but that happened because of Donald. But I was also thinking... that the other love story should be about Willy and Donald. So basically, Mae would be the rival. And the issue of the story is that it's about gender fluidity. I like it. Seems good. I was also thinking... For the ending, it would be best if Willy becomes blind. I feel like if the ending was sad, it would be heavier and more intense. Yeah. Let's just save the happy ending for something else. Yeah. See? We cracked it. I'm sorry. Gabs... I spoke to Marian and she understands. Actually, she's always known. Wow. How convenient for you. -I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. -No. I don't understand. So, this whole time that I wasn't available, you have Marian on reserve? Gabs, it's not like that, okay? I have to go. Allow me to love you, Gabs. Even if you don't want me to. Gabs, I've loved you all these years... even though I knew nothing would happen between us. And, Gabs, I can go on loving you for years to come... knowing nothing's ever going to happen between us. Because that's how much I love you, Gabs. Gabs... I'm sorry. Dennis and I are working on a script. And the producer already approved it. It was our concept. You let him use it? He already got it approved, and besides, it would be a waste to not use the concept. And you know I can't do it on my own. But you are not on your own. You have me. I thought maybe Dennis and I should work on it, if that's okay. Fine, go ahead. Do it with him. Gabriel, please. Don't be jealous of Dennis. Well, how can I know for sure that you don't have feelings for him? -I don't know, okay? I'm so tired. -You're tired of this. Let's cut this shit, then. Gabriel, please. Gabriel. Forget about Gabriel. Babe, why don't you give Dennis another chance? How do you do that, Mom? You keep jumping from one lover to the next. Well, I'm just following my heart. Even if somebody gets hurt? Getting hurt is relative. Besides, in your case it's different. You can't hurt Gabriel, because he's dead. And you said it yourself. Dennis and Marian are over. Baby... Give yourself another chance. Love. Love again. You know what, Mom? I don't think you've moved on from Papa. Maybe that's why you keep going through lovers... because you can't find anyone to replace Papa. Gabby. Sorry I made you wait. I had to fix something. -That's okay. -But thanks for coming. Dennis asked me to speak to you. It's over between us. I was his girlfriend, but the entire time I knew what I was getting myself into. He explained everything to me. He made it clear to me that he has always loved you. And I can't possibly compete with your history. I just wanted to love him. But it's over now, and I've accepted that. I'm not a martyr. I just know where I stand. And I'm grateful for the short time that I spent with Dennis. That's enough. Better than nothing, right? But it's you he really loves, Gabby. So go for it, you have my blessing. I have to go. Dennis, what are you doing here? Gabs, why aren't you answering my calls? Can we just talk later? Then what? You're going to leave me again. Gabs, what's the matter? I know you have feelings for me, Gabs. I can feel it. But I don't know what I ever did to you. If I did something wrong... Oh, my God! -Are you okay? -Are you okay? -Yes, I am. -What happened? -It just fell. -Jack, your lights! Gabs! Gabs, that wasn't me. You know you're the only one I can touch. That was a complete accident. Gabs, where are we going? Just get in the car. Gabs. Where are we going? Just get in, please. Gabs! Okay, you can go now. You love me now, right? Yes. Okay, you can go now. -What? -Dennis, leave. -Gabs! -Go on, just leave. Get out, Dennis. -Gabs, wait. What's wrong? -Get out! What happened? I don't know. That's when we realized the reason why I could see and hear Gabriel even when he's dead is because of my deep love for him. And now that that love is fading... he's slowly fading with it. Gabs... I don't want to be gone. I don't want to be gone. No. You will never be lost to me. No. Good afternoon, Ma'am. Hi, good afternoon. Where's Mommy? -She's in the garden. -All right. Mommy? Hi. What a pleasant surprise! Gabriel's dad will be happy to see you. Gabs, tell her there's something I want her to know. Mommy, I came here because Gabriel wants to tell you something. Tell her you dreamt about me. You see, I dreamt about him. And... I love you very much, Mommy. I miss you so much. He wants you to know that... he loves you very much and that he misses you a lot. Tell him... Tell him that I miss him so much. Gabs, tell her that she needs to help Danny. That Dad has to listen to Danny. Mommy, if you can, he says you should help Danny. That Dad has to listen to Danny. -Come, let's go inside. -Okay. Dad. Hi, sir. Why are you crying? -Gabs! -What now? Wait, what's happening? Can you please just stay away from me? Gabs, did I do something wrong? I don't understand you. Don't bother me. Just please forget about me. Give her up, Dennis. She doesn't love you. -Hi, Ma'am. -Come in, Gabby. Please sit down. What's this? You're resigning? I'm sorry it's short notice. Is there a problem? Nothing, Ma'am. Not about work. It's just that I've been wanting to pursue my dream to get into filmmaking. Okay, but know that you can come back to us anytime. Thank you. Tell her how she was always nice to me back then. I remember how kind you were to Gabriel back then. I was really fond of him. I thought of him as my own son. He always talked about you. I miss him. I miss you too, Ma'am Louise. -Gabs, Gabs... -Dennis, what is wrong with you? Gabs, I tried to stay away, but I can't do it. Dennis, we can't be together. He's still around. -Gabriel's still around. -Gabs, I know. I know. But you need to move on. Forget about him. You don't understand what I mean. He's still here. I can still see him, hold him. We don't know how that happened but it started right after he died. He hasn't left me, like he said. Like he promised. I can still see him, and we're still living under the same roof. That's why this can't work between us. If you wanted me gone... you could have just said so. You didn't have to make up stories. Dennis. Hello, Dennis? We don't need them. We don't need anybody else. But I wasn't so sure anymore. I didn't want to lose Gabriel, but I didn't want to lose Dennis either. I think I've fallen for Dennis. You seem worried. I'm fine. Is something bothering you? Just tell me. It's nothing. All right. You're still thinking about Dennis. Of course. Of course, you're thinking about him, right? Do you want me gone now? Gabriel, you've seen me avoiding him. So where were you? I was at Mommy's. Then why didn't you take me with you? You're being paranoid again. Gabs! Gabs! Wake up, please! Gabs! Are you okay? Gabs! Gabs! Gabs, please wake up! -Coming through. -Excuse me! She has stabilized. She didn't incur any serious injuries. Just the usual trauma and shock. You may take her home tomorrow. Just let her rest for the night. Thank you, doc. Thank you very much. Watch her for me. I'll be at the cashier's to settle the bill. All right. Don't worry, Gabs. The doctor said you're going to be okay. I'm so sorry, Gabs. I'm so, so sorry. I don't know if you really are still hanging around. I'm not sure if Gabs was telling the truth. But if you're still here, would you please, Gabriel, leave her be. Let her live her life in peace. What kind of love do you have for her? You almost got her killed. Is that what you wanted? I'm letting you go. You can love again. You can love again. I want all your dreams to come true. Make our movie concept with Dennis. -I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -No, no, no. You don't have to be sorry. I understand. Gabby... I love you very, very much.
