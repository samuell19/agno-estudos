Somewhere in New Zealand UNCLE CHARLES - What's up? - He locked himself in. Is that why you got me out of bed at 4 am? Ever since teatime. Doctor! He's downstairs. I've known him for 42 years. Never seen him drink tea. Answer me! That door is sacred wood, he treasures it. I don't examine patients through sacred doors. Sheep shagger! You fucked up my sacred door! That twit Baudoin paid you. So that's it! Stop, Charles. Don't bust our balls with your goddam door. Buy another one. Let go of his hair. Right now! You're a wreck. White trash! What pride? Stuff your pride, corrupt savage! Enough, Charles. You're a hopeless drunk. You upset Louma, in front of his wife too. I'm going to die anyway. You traitors hid it from me. You too, Doctor Duncan. Doctor my ass! What's he talking about? He read his medical results. Baudoin, are you an utter cretin? I said hide them until I talk to him. But I did, doctor. He must have bust open my desk. Baudoin! My secretary for 30 years. Living under my roof! You knew! You betrayed me! Only to protect you, Charles. Bullshit! To grab my heritage! I refuse to hear that. Baudoin! Don't you start. He's pissed as a newt. Make some coffee. And don't get in a state! How very classy. Wiping his snot on his silk dressing gown. What the fuck am I doing in this wilderness? No one forced you. You can't even speak our language. Just go. I will. - Back to my family in France. - To damn all! In 40 years you never even looked for your so-called sister. We offered to help. I had my reasons, Belgian twit! - Missed. - Get out! My so-called... Wimp! Charles, calm down. You're upset by your tests. The results aren't good. They're alarming, I agree. I asked Baudoin not to tell you, I wanted to explain personally. But it's not 100% bad. We contacted the eminent Dr. Clifford from San Diego University. He's coming to Auckland next week to meet you. Another eminent asshole. He'll observe me like a doomed laboratory rat. He'll nod without saying a word, then leave with a fat cheque and a first class air ticket. The 4th in 2 months. My fortune has limits. Not for the moment. You can spend it all as you have no heirs. I can't help it if my wives left me. You left them. A subtle difference. The last one had 24 hours notice, plus a cheque and two Jack Russells. Did I throw Miranda out? I can't remember. I can. Like a used Kleenex. I took the poor girl in. So that twit Baudoin was right. He said: "That bitch Miranda is fucking the doc." I can't believe he said that. Get wise. He's a viper. It's his one quality. Your heart's fine. Just stop drinking. What's the point? I'm going to die. What was it all for anyway? For no one. My life is a fiasco. What's the name? Whose? Miranda? No! My disease. The Wallenberg Syndrome. Clifford is a world expert in orphan diseases. Have him come, you never know. A miracle, why not? Isn't Miranda a bit young for you? The same age difference as yours. 23 years. An orphan disease. That word has always haunted me. In France, 50 years ago, I may have abandoned an orphan. Ever inquired if she's still alive? Perhaps. So I can die in peace? The Belgian twit! You were right. I owe you $1000. The doc was fucking my wife. Doctor, I hope you don't believe that twaddle? That's all very well... Shit! How many more? Get me out of it, Clifford. Name your price. Here's an advance for your new hospital. The rest if I'm cured. So make sure I attend the inauguration! Fuck your science and research. I'm doing it for me. No more photos, twit. I've had it. Time to see you out. Ratu still sulking? Yes. He's overdoing it. He plays video games all day. Charles's real name isn't Doumeng. He told me that years ago, after a drunken evening probably. Radiguet. So it is. I'd forgotten. You're looking for his sister in France? It's high time. - How old is she? - About sixty. No trace of Louise Radiguet. Tricky. He hasn't kept any documents or photos. France is as chaotic as ever. All the local archives were burned. But he won't give up the search. If it's in vain, he'll go under. No, he won't. Stick with it. He needs an interest. And who knows, we might have a nice surprise. Somewhere in France There's no ketchup on my sausage. Dunk it in the bottle, Romy. I'm job hunting. Phone, Elodie! Chill, mum. It's Rosalinde. Shit, Corinne. I have to work! So do I! I keep ringing Louise but a kid answers. Call Elodie's cell. Good idea. Try using that little brain. Don't talk mean. Piss off! Get on. And don't flash your pussy around. Goodbye, sir. Hold this. And don't trash my chrome. José, wait! I can't hear a thing. Elodie, it's me! What's going on? Who's been answering the phone? No one. It's Rosalinde. She's playing. Give mum granny's cell phone. Give it to me. OK. Clothes? Cool. I'll tell her. Ciao! See you. Mum! José's dropping Corinne off to pick up her car. Will you go to her office, she has clothes for you? You bet I'll go! Corinne's clothes are fab. A bit yucky, no? Elodie, when you find your job will you give me some ketchup? A job? Dream on, Romy! Do it like this. A lot quicker. It's divine! I nicked your t-shirt. It suits you. Needs tits. It's like always the same! All the X File PRs talk English. I'll have to do a course in the US. Why the US? Why? Show biz is like totally American! How about a correspondence course? No way! Courses are deadly. Hello! Poo poo! Never touch grown ups' phones. Fragile. Coming with granny? No! Not granny. You're so cute! We won't be friends if you bash Mathilde on the head. What a messy face. I'm off. Look after the babes. I never stop! I'll chase up Jeanette to paid for her kid. Don't. They've been out on strike, she's skint. Romeo's bottle at 4 pm, 210 grams. Bye, you guys! Bye, Louise! When am I going to see you? I want you. I call you nonstop, but a tiny tot answers every time. Watch your phone! Are you nuts? Stop yelling. Your wife's watching. Want her to find out? Hiya, Léonie! Tomorrow. 8.30am at the bus stop. OK. Been to the pool? Apparently I'm flabby. Hi, José. I'm late. What's his problem? You know how he is. But his talents elsewhere make up for it! How's it going with his son? Kevin? The school says he'd sleep better at home. Here. He says he's looking for work, he just listens to techno in the garage, full blast, 24/7. Nightmare! José was right, his ex gave him custody as revenge. A bush is a bush. That's not a bush. Is he the fella? Doesn't his wife suspect? Where do you go? A holiday home on Guérinière Bay. He has 60 shutters to paint! I know that house. Our office sold it to a Parisian. And the electrician? Nounours? He's in Nantes. He repairs our pylons after a storm. It can take him 3 days, we have a ball! Tank empty? I'm broke. As usual. Take 30 euros. Is it enough? Brilliant! In my opinion, it was better run in his father's day... Here she is. Monsieur Blandier wants to see Monsieur Renard. As he's in the Canary Islands for an inheritance, I suggested he sees you. Wait in my office. So tiresome that he's never here. On the right. I must change my will as soon as possible. Because of my wife. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Excellent! So it's true what they say? You keep the practice up and running! Just doing my job, Monsieur Blandier. - Did your boss move you in here? - No, I did. He's always gadding about, I might as well use it. Why the Canary Islands? To pick up his new Trimaran. They've got my name on them. Gorgeous! Don't you wear them? José says they make my bum look huge. What's this? From Auckland... I don't believe it... Listen, Louison. Brother looking for an old bag, local, discretion vital, aged 11 in 1957, an orphan... All expenses paid. Substantial bonus if found. Urgent. From Zealand. - Where's that? - Down under. Radiguet. Louise Radiguet. Know any Radiguets? Radiguet? No. She lived in Bunny Field. Try the Children's Home or the Convent of Mercy. No other options. Spot on. Smart girl! Help me investigate? - I've never done it. - Give it a go. I'll reply right away. And say what? "Our descendancy department, "run by Corinne Beaujard, legal clerk... "Head clerk..." sounds better. "Can handle the case. "And we already have a lead. "Two promising leads." Bluff a bit. Does that department exist? It does now, dumbo. I'll Google them, you can't be too careful. Hey! Look who's behind the holding. What's a holding? Let's see. Companies. Look. Read it. It's in English. "Sole owner: Charles Doumeng, aged 69, "single, French. "The top sports equipment manufacturer "in the southern hemisphere. The oval ball king!" Is that rugby? José will know. Doumeng. Know any round here? Doesn't ring a bell. It's not his sister's name. Right. You missed your vocation. But isn't he dead? No. But soon will be. Huge donation to medical research. Rich? Rolling in it! We must move fast. Before anyone else cuts in. Mind getting dressed? Yes, Maxime, what is it? Monsieur Blandier, 5 pm tomorrow to change his will? Suits me. What's with his wife? Writing cheques to her hairdresser, she wants to adopt him. Classic! No more appointments for me, I must chill. 7th largest fortune in the country! I'll ask for an advance. We can all get a bite. All of us? We'll meet tonight. José, Kevin... Even your lazy daughter. She can go through 50 years of our legal files, I bet Radiguet is in there. I'll give them my personal details... Bingo! Get a move on! - Where to? - Bunny Field. It's a retail park now. So we'll go shopping. Got anything to eat for tonight? Keep José happy. Bounties and baby food. Evenings we just graze. Tough break for him if it was here. I've taken some pics for the file. No trace of the old girl anywhere. I look mental! I hope Elodie and Kevin will get on. They have a lot in common: both bone idle. Know why you're called Louise? No. Why? Just an idea. No! Don't go there. Not again, like when old Bottin adopted me on his death bed. That's how you all came to be living in his house. With his furniture and garden tools. Complaining? I'd rather it wasn't bang on the highway. How ungrateful! Another super day... In France they've come up with a lead. How are you feeling today? Like a dude who's had his blood sucked. Drained. Yep. I wrote him a cheque. Cut to the chase. Is it serious? It's from Mauprivez. Know it? Do I know Mauprivez? And how! Our first positive response. They mention two leads. Which are? They don't say. As they want a hefty advance I Googled them to be safe. A woman. Corinne Beaujard. Not bad. "Her native Brittany has left its imprint." Bullshit! She looks a sassy little bitch. Charles! Her profile is sound. Chair of several companies. On the local Retirement Homes committees. Burgomaster. Burgomaster? Deputy burgomaster. Burgomaster? This is France, you Belgian twit! We say city mayor there. As it says she's single, I'd say her profile is: the mayor is her boss and he's fucking her. You have a filthy mind. Do you OK the advance or not? If she can find my Louise before I stuff it, it's cheap at the price. But she better hurry. Baudoin! One question. Where's that vile suit from? Auckland's top tailor. Your tailor. Will that be all? The guy has an empire! Elodie, is it clear? You look for Louise Radiguet in the office records. Kevin. For the radio stations. And the text and money for the Nantes newspaper ads. Oh man! How do I get there? Dad's banned my scooter. Just this once, José? As it's for work. Can he? What do you think? Yes. A one off. Cool it, boy. I can change my mind. We're on! Léonie agreed to look after the kids for me. She's given us eggs from her hens. Eat up while it's hot. What did you say? Yummy! Like you said: I'm depressed. I'm going in for a check up as I can't eat or sleep. When do you stop? As soon as the advance is green lit. An ex of mine is a social worker. She can check out the loony bins. Louise, we do the old age homes, visit the oldies in the villages. Sweetheart, mind if I take a peep? Yes! They've agreed! It's massive! All you asked for? Every cent! They didn't waste time. It's in English! I knew it. Like I said, mum. Everyone there talks English. The whole country? OK, forget what I said. I'll take sick leave. If they're paying up, she's worth a fortune. Here's to... Louise... - Thingummy. - Radiguet! Cool! We're gonna clean up. Find her first! Briefing in 3 days time. And keep it quiet. Family only. No one cuts in. Let's move! Louise honey, sorry but there's work. Kevin! Get cracking. Hey, like... What's your cell? 0663, then all 8s. Elodie! For the office, no nails. It's not The X Factor. Thank you. You clever little thing. At least you're grateful. Ever worked in the Convent of Mercy? For 2 years. Washing up. But there's nothing left there. We'll drop by tomorrow. Bye! See how the old folk like us to look classy? They feel safe, so they talk. You need a bag. Maybe. But we didn't learn much. It's like she never existed. How many nuns are left? Two. But not in working order. Did you teach her? Yes. So Louise Radiguet lived here in the orphanage? For how long? A very long time ago. No. How long was she here? How should I know? She's gone now. Poor little girl. Always her eyes. Where did she go? Into the wood! The wood. Onwards... Try to remember. Then I'll go. What happened to little Louise? She died. Are you sure? When? How should I know? It's all jumbled up in my head. She died ages ago. But there was the wood. Of course. What was wrong with her eyes? Scared. Scared of what? How should I know? What a dump! How can you live like this? It's a pigsty! Go easy. Leave some for your friend. Forget it. We'll never get any sense out of her. Piss off! I want my soup. It's 4 o'clock. Of course. There. You always put some wine in my bowl. How are you getting on? You're an investigator, not a home help. She trusts me. I think she knew her. She rambles about a poor little girl, her eyes, a little wood... She says she's dead. Then it jams up. I found old school photos and registers. Those cupboards are a fucking mess. Let's get cracking! They're photos. Like them? Very nice. We can't wait till she wolfs down her soup. Don't block her, she's fragile. Your soup after. First find Louise Radiguet. Louise Radiguet! Get it? Say if you see her. Stay out of it. I'll heat up your soup for you. Yeah, heat it up. And take a good look. There. That's poor little Louise. Is that Louise? Radiguet? Sure? Do you recognize her? Of course it's her. The eyes! 1958. It all fits. Proof she was in the orphanage. Some proof, Corinne. You can hardly see her. You're right. And Bunny Field is a retail park now. Flimsy evidence. And Dolly may be wrong. How long was your poor little girl in the orphanage? How should I know? We'll send the pics to Rabbit Hill. It's something. He knows her better than us. She is his sister. My little Louise. It's her. No doubt about it. How pretty she was, even behind her little hands. I'm devastated, Belgian twit. Devastated. I understand. It's so emotional for you. It was in 1958, the Convent of Mercy Orphanage near Machecoul. Apparently there's a witness who knew her. Where is she now? That's still a mystery. Baudoin. Double the fee for Beaujard and her team. And add a bonus. We must find out if my little Louise is still alive before I die. And there may be heirs, who knows? Right away. A photo of Bunny Field, where your house was. I must warn you, Madame Beaujard says it's unrecognizable. Bunny Field? What happened? 50 years happened, Charles! They congratulate us! No one else has come up with a lead. Time is running out for Charles. That's clear as daylight. He mentions possible heirs. He must be going mouldy. How long has he got? Days! He's doubled the fee to move faster. Doubled it! Plus another bonus. Do your sums. I have. We'll never find her. Elodie's come up with nothing. Me neither. Dad zilch. And you only have one crap photo. How can someone be nowhere? The old bag's dead and buried in a wood. Break your nun's code, she may be talking sense. If she's dead... And he wants an heir. We'll find him one... made to measure. Not again. And how can you prove she's dead? With a death certificate. In due form. Lost in the town hall fire years ago, then it turned up miraculously. We found lots in Mauprivez, scorched but readable. And the heir? Forge a birth certificate, record it, then put it out on line. I can use the town hall rubber stamps, no one the wiser! It hangs together. Since he doesn't have an heir... Don't you find it dishonest? Absolutely not! You're so negative, mum! We're not robbing anyone. So it's all sorted? This money is heaven sent. Aren't you sick of struggling? Who'll be the heir? Only you and I never knew our mothers. I can't be the heiress, they'd never swallow it. So in fact... that leaves you. Who's the lucky one? Muggins! You're called Louise too, mum! Awesome! You said it! But if your mother doesn't want to... Exactly. I don't. OK, Louison. All wiped out. I won't pressurise you, not my style. Let's go again: "I, Sister Marie-Joseph, "assisted at the birth of a baby, September 5th, 1975, "in the Convent of Mercy, "a female child, "weighing 2.7 kilos." I don't believe I'm doing this. You agreed, no? Don't start whinging. She'll never finish at this rate. Right. Next... "The daughter of René Bottin, "the convent gardener, "and Louise Radiguet, "who died giving birth "to the child who was named Louise, "after her mother..." What a sad story. - Can I have a chocolate? - After. So the paper doesn't get dirty. Don't we say her brother ran off in the wood? Stop messing us about. Write what we say. He ran off in the wood? Fuck! It's complicated enough already! Get the rubber stamps out and start stamping. You're so soppy. Let me. "The child was placed with a foster family, "and later recognized by her father. "She bears his name, Louise Bottin." Duncan! About time. You're past regattas. How are you today? I came as soon as I could. Baudoin informed me. What a sad outcome. Your sister's dead? Yes, she's dead. Good riddance. You're taking it well. Sure, old chap. Past history. It was over 30 years ago. But my sister left me a gift before dying. She's my niece. Her daughter. Louise. Pretty as a daisy. That's her husband. A gym instructor. Fine fellow. And their 3 children. They're called... They use so much red tape in France. The father's called José. Elodie and Kevin are the oldest, aged 18 and 17, little Rosalinde is only 3. There we are. I have a family! So many lost years. And the 2 youngsters can't get work. The irony of it. Baudoin has done a splendid job. Do you realize, Charles? He found your sister's daughter after all these years, in no time at all. A miracle! I suggest we run a routine DNA check. DNA my ass! My niece's face is guarantee enough! Belgian twit! Splitting image of my sister. He has no idea. See how honest the family is? He exhausts me sometimes. Very well. If you don't need me. Very well! Before you piss off like those 2 faggots, have them set up the webcam in Mauprivez, so we can talk. You've had a brilliant idea for once. Use it. Duncan, open the bottle. Pour us a drink. Just a drop for me. For a toast. But on the rocks. I was getting worried. Perfect. You've already dressed? Good. - Been shopping? - Yes! Mum hasn't, in case she has to repay the money! Her issue. Celebrating Xmas? Is it a bit OTT? Don't listen. You look gorgeous. In a bad mood, Louison? Lousy. She threw up all day. I had good reason to. Get some perspective. Meaning? Meaning we've found you an uncle 20,000 kms away who wants to say hello and leave you all his money. Is that too much to ask? Don't worry. It'll be fine. - If there's a problem... - Like what? If you feel you're losing it, or you want to denounce us... Just make me a sign. - Hi, big sister! - Hi, kid brother! Isn't this awesome? What did you buy? Get it together. We're going on line. Sit down without moving the chairs. Louise in the middle. Then me with the babe. The two kids on either side of us. The empty chair for Corinne, you introduce us then beat it. A sweet for the babe in case she wants her mum. OK. Go for it. Quiet everyone. It'll ring any minute now. - What's the time there? - 9 am. Shut up. Corinne! Stay on track. Where the fuck is Duncan? He overslept. This crap doesn't work, twit! Leave it to Ratu. The expert. We forgot the dogs! We can't start without them! You're a pain in the ass! He talks French? Since when? Since he started translating your insults. Charles, your family. Been there long? We only just arrived. Hello, Monsieur Doumeng. I'm Corinne Beaujard. Delighted to meet you. Likewise. Where's my niece? Here. With all her family. How pretty you are. With your mother's golden curls. Hello, Louise. I'm your Uncle Charles. Finding you is a miracle. Hello. First I want to thank you... for... Sorry. It's all too much for me. This is my... José, I presume? Hello! I'm so pleased to meet you. Thank you for everything, uncle. Don't thank me, my boy. Here's our little Rosalinde. Say hello. Hi. I'm Kevin. Hello. I'm Elodie, the oldest. I realize how hard it is for you all to talk so unexpectedly like this. But what a lovely family you are. I wish I could hug you all. Louise, don't cry. Meeting at a distance isn't easy. Yet at the same time we have so much to say. Here's what we'll do. You'll all come to New Zealand. Terrific! For 2 weeks! Now! Right, twit? Baudoin? No problem! You're expected. What does our little legal lady think? It's a brilliant idea! Isn't it? - Great! - Awesome! You have your passports? No! Nor do the children! Madame Beaujard can arrange it. It's her job. Absolutely! Stop! I'll tell you everything. Go on! Tell them. About flying. Flying? It scares you stiff. I'm absolutely terrified in planes. You can't imagine. No problem, Louise. I'm just the same. Alcohol and barbiturates work wonders. You forget you ever travelled! Right, Belgian twit? Baudoin? Who touched something? It's crashed! Where's Ratu? Gone to get the dogs. Never there when you need him! Ratu! Try to contact them. Shit! It was all going so well. I'll straighten Duncan out. That cretin didn't even come! Hear how he talks to them? Like feral! We're in deep fucking shit. I told you. The wires are bust. Nothing doing tonight. - Where are you going? - To bed. Classy! Scratch your nose too. Back off. Let me think this through. Think fast. Lying to uncle 20,000 kms away, OK. But face to face down under? No! There's always a way. So how do I tell Kevin's nosey parker mum we're off to New Zealand in term time? Especially as you owe her alimony. Stay out of this! Put the chairs away! Idiot. Shit! It's them. Answer, at least. - What did he call you? - The little legal lady! Hello? What a shame, we were cut off. It tripped out. Yes, they've left. The child was asleep. Louise was so moved. It's only normal. They're thinking about it. Yes, I'll get it fixed, but tomorrow's Sunday. Absolutely, they were over the moon. You can't call them, no signal. Yes, that's France for you! How funny! Speak soon. Very soon, Madame Beaujard. France says you suck. I've just spoken to Madame Beaujard. Damned cheek! You turn up late, laughing. You'll be laughing too. May I? Sure it'll work? Cool, Corinne. The lead goes round your ankle. Stay close, just in case. How shall I put it? "As it stands... "they're thinking it over... "They're thinking it over. As it stands..." The little legal lady. Are you alone? Hello, Monsieur Doumeng. You know... They're thinking it over. As it stands... Everything's changed. Yesterday I had an incurable orphan disease. I had 2 months to live. Those asshole doctors got it 100% wrong! 100% wrong? You're cured? I was never even ill! Or dying. No more operation. Just a light anti-fatigue treatment. I'll give my family a surprise. Top secret. We'll celebrate together in France. I'm coming over. After a trip to San Diego to inaugurate a hospita... Not again! Anyway I've told her what's important. You could have introduced me. "Ride a cock horse To Banbury Cros "See a fine lady Upon a white horse "Giddy up giddy up" I want to die! What's Corinne doing? Give her time. She's in the A & E having stitches, she was pissing blood. More, Daddy Hug! Call the police! I'm confessing! Give that money back, Elodie. We stole it! That's crap, mum, giving it back. You make me cringe. She's obsessing about the money. Off the wall! Fuck! He has no family anyway. We'll all be fucked if she confesses. Like right. Take your daughter. I'm starving. Not crying! Right, cutie. She's stopped. How are you, Corinne? I will survive. Got a strong drink? Just what I need. Thanks. Where are they? In the bedroom. Talking. She's better. So am I, thanks. How did he do it? Have you decided? We will now. Hands up for giving it back. No one? For being rich for life after a little effort? Good. All sorted. We must get ready fast. Uncle'll be here in 2 weeks. Got a plan B? A plan B? Find a house for the family. And move in right away. Isolated in the country, people gossip. I know the ideal place, it's on our books. It's so quiet. Makes a change from trucks. It needs a bit of work. They never finished decorating. And it's been empty for ages. Let's look round. Look, mum! Fab! And it's huge! I'll take this room and Kevin that one. Excellent. This can be the parents' room. You sleep with Rosalinde, so she gets used to her new mummy. Shower next door. Alright. And José? In the living room. We'll get a sofa bed. I'll choose it. I'm not having my vertebra damaged. We'll buy you the best, darling. Action stations! When can you move in? Whenever. We haven't much stuff. Kevin can't bring anything with him. My ex would smell a rat. And she's dead nosey. Here. I made you a list. "Bathrobes, towels, aftershave... "A bed for Kevin... "A flat screen TV?" Whoa there! Any halfway decent family has a flat screen. I don't have Céline Dion's bank account! No. But this show was all your idea. Add a juice extractor for me. Vital. The toilet's leaking! Kitchen too. We need a plumber. Out of the question! We didn't hide out here to have a plumber gossiping. It's easy-peasy. I'll do it. You moved out fast. I better hurry. José has to go to work. Tell Louise to watch her depression. Get some peace and quiet. I'll take care of the kids, no worries. You forgot to give me your address! Can't hear, I'll call you! Very, very dodgy. Very. You've been together how long? 18 years! We met in May, it's so vivid. OK. Where did you meet? At the Machecoul Fair. On the bumper cars. She was ravishing. Not in the script, José. - I'll go on... - Hello! Shoes! We didn't strip the floor for you to mess it up. They're clean but OK. Chill out, José. You're early today. I was shopping. Champagne glasses. Useful. - Any news? - Yes. All fine. A briefing with "Boodain". Uncle stays in the Grand Hotel, Nantes. I'll be his driver. On his case day and night. I've taken time off. The little legal lady is keen. She'll be our aunt soon! He hasn't changed his mind? And he won't, so get used to it. He's really coming. It still looks a bit empty. I keep saying that. Take stuff from your office. No way! That's going too far. Although... Got a minute tomorrow? It's just temporary. That furniture belongs to Our Lord. Don't worry, we've told him. In that case. When you massage you must get in here... the trapezius muscle. Let yourself go. Relax. Fuck! Dad! Mum! Kevin! Uncle's in the garden! How's that? Perfect if you lose fuck. Everyone says fuck. You mean you do. Then what? Then I run over to kiss him. "Hi, I'm Elodie. Can I call you Uncle?" Bring beer, we'll eat in your room. Cool. Hey, Kevin. Have you showed Corinne? What? Rosalinde! Where's Daddy Hug? And Kevin? And Elodie? And mummy? Where's mummy? Clever girl! Come on. See? He could open a kennels! Kevin, amazing! We're ready for uncle. It's incredible, you look like a real family. If only we were. When do we get our roots done? The day before he arrives. Tuesday's good. You've cut the weeds. I'll buy some garden furniture. I'm off to the office, lots to do. Tell Elodie to lose those blue fingernails for a bit! My God! Elodie! Kevin! Help! Elodie! What's going on? Where were you? Clear everything out. Find some dishcloths. - Do we call José? - Better not! Is it the moment to screw your brother? Go with the flow, mum. That's what you said. I did? Use a condom? Do you? Grotesque! I'll call Corinne. We must end this mess. Fuck, the old man... Help. Hello. I seem to have picked a bad moment for my surprise. A bit. Daddy Hug! You must be my little Rosalinde? I'm Charles. And who's that? Your mummy? Mummy Sweetie! Louise... My Louise. Hi, I'm Elodie. Can I call you uncle? Don't hang up. I just spoke to uncle's Rabbit. He's in France! He cancelled his hotel. Where is he? In the garden. He can't be! He is. I'll warn José. Don't bother. He's here. With his bandana and gris-gris? They both wear the same. - What did he say? - Nothing. He's crying. He bought us gifts and champagne. Use the glasses? Are you mad? It's a disaster. We're wading in mud and you talk about glasses! Say nothing. I'm on my way. Leaving already? Enjoy your break, Corinne! To you, my lovely Louise. And to our reunited family. To Uncle Charles! Fantastic! A Breitling! Look at this! A Nintendo DS each, and lots of t-shirts. Show him your camera. Nice! Digital. Such lovely presents. You shouldn't have. "What a surprise, Monsieur Doumeng. What a surprise! "This is a surprise!" It was your grandmother's. I kept it for your mother. Now it's yours. I can't. I don't deserve it. Your mother inherited it. One day your daughter will. I can't, I tell you... She's like me. Crying runs in the family. Are you mental? He says it's yours. Then it'll be mine. Don't be a cow. Come on, darling. The flood. Your arrival. Her mother's bracelet. It's all too fast for her. Darling, you know what? We should tell Corinne Beaujard. There's no hurry. Let's stay together as a family. Pour us some champagne, José. Madame Beaujard exhausts me, she's such a control freak. Don't you agree? 100%! She does my head in. Do this, do that, fix your hair... You have to know her. You know her better than I do! Kevin! She's helped us so much. That's what I pay her for. I popped in to say hi! Talk of the devil. It's a calamity! Monsieur Doumeng. How are you? Extraordinary! Aren't you surprised to see me here? I can't get over it. What a surprise! This is a surprise! Hello, José, how are you? I'm good. And you? Plumbing is a profession. Sit down. Weren't you arriving tomorrow? Maybe. I've lost track. I managed to find my way here. I had your old address. Your neighbour helped me. Our neighbour Léonie? A very nice lady. But it's so noisy there. That nosey bitch Léonie! The great thing is you're here with your family. Quite a shock for them. Certainly was. Especially for Louise. She was panic-stricken. By the way, how's your hotel? Didn't they tell you? I've moved. To be nearer my family. I'm at the Saint Eulalie Manor. Just beyond the wood. I can walk over every morning. So long as you're happy. So what shall we do tomorrow? You do whatever you like. I'm staying with my family. If they can spare me some time. I'd love to explore the area. It's simple. For this evening, I've booked a table in Nantes, at the Atlantide. To celebrate our first dinner as a family. I hear it's excellent. Absolutely. Excellent. I can't take it. When's he leaving? Patience. Just 2 weeks. What a sweet couple. They're still in love. As you're going, do me a favour. Find a plumber. A plumber? Of course, Monsieur Doumeng. Right away. Fucking hell! Turn, you fucker! Can you take our photo? Happy to. I'll lend you my shrimping net. Say cheese! That bridge wasn't there. I don't recognize anything. Yet I left France from here, 50 years ago. I got myself a job on a boat bound for the Pacific. I wanted to go as far away as I could, and forget everything. Beyond the seas. Corinne, don't call me when he's around! We're in Saint-Nazaire. On the port. No, he doesn't ask any questions. He just talks about himself. I was devastated with grief, my whole family wiped out in a car crash. Louise, my little sister, was dying. I was 17, almost your age, Kevin. Got a Kleenex, mum? Don't overdo it. One for me too. Right. I'll stop rambling. Come here, Louise. Finding each other is a miracle. Sometimes I have to pinch myself. Here. Let's see. You're the best, Kevin. Hold this for a minute. Let's have a look. Lower. It's powerful. Like right! Go ahead, Kevin. What do you think, Louise? It's very... very striking. Really. Unusual. Hurt yourself? I'm badly wounded. Let's see. My mum's a nurse, she says never ignore cuts. I'm not a nurse! Rubbish. I just say be careful. I'll disinfect it. You idiot. It's not a good time! No, Corinne, it never is! Bye! Bunny Field Tough, but these supermarkets are a life saver. There was nothing here before. Not one shop. - It's still a blow. - Was it here? Here. I'm sure it was. There was a green bench in the garden in front of our house. We were here, aligned with the church. The garden came to here. They destroyed the Bunny Field of my childhood. There were 2 or 3 houses near us. And by the river, if I remember rightly, there's a leafy little graveyard. Let's go see. Why not say it's a garden centre? To give him a surprise. All that's left is the doorway. You drive, Louise. I'm done in. Ramses! Ramses, come back! Heel! Are you scared of dogs? No. He's my dog. And he's with my mum! Apart from the sea, nothing's the same. You've been away for 50 years. What did you expect? You're right. I should drop it. Convent of Mercy Mum, let's visit the convent to give Charles a laugh, he could meet the two old girls. It's getting late. Another day. I'd rather go back to my hotel. Thank you, my dears. I couldn't have faced reviving all this without you. Quietly, don't wake up the child. You look tired. Sheer hell. Plus your wife and the dog. It was close. Still no questions? No. Bizarre. We keep goofing but he blanks it out. He's happy, that's all. Come here. Come on. It will all work out. Corinne's breathing down my neck. Come here. There. It's her. Don't bother. No, I better go to bed. Hey, wait... I haven't seen José, where's his bike? He left ages ago. He goes out the back way now, rue des Salines. One port. Why is José unreachable? And avoiding me? What are you up to? Back off. I'm not up to anything with your José. What do you mean? I'm not hot for it! Aren't we pretending he's my fella? I've got my eye on you! I wasn't born yesterday! Nut case! Your holiday over? Yes. That's me. The office is where I feel best. Louise! Action at last. He invited me to Sunday lunch. You know why? No. a) He's not my uncle. b) You know I can't cook. I'll do the food. OK. You deal with it all, no problem. Don't trash the plate. Shit! New plates? From the caterers. Did you dress like a tramp to ruin our lunch? Not at all. Louise, your lunch was perfect. A lot of work for you. Come and sit down. You're a lucky man, José. If she wasn't my niece, I'd court her. How did you two meet? - Machecoul Fair! - Mauprivez Fair! No, on the bumper cars! In Mauprivez. Excuse me, José, there's never been a fair in Mauprivez. Never. You see! You met, that's what matters. But Louise had Elodie very young? I was 16. Same as me! It was torture! Right, José? Yes, she was ever so brave. I can't remember Kevin's birth. Being in pain, I mean. Or Rosalinde's. You hardly felt it. Totally painless. It's thanks to you that I've found them. I want to buy them a house before I leave. You handle it. I'll start tomorrow. Thank your uncle for such a wonderful gift. Going back? Yes, my boy. I miss my dogs, and my friends. In 50 years you create bonds. But you can come to Rabbit Hill, it's your home. You too, my dear. Come and see us maybe? I'd love to. Coffee, Charles? With pleasure. He's pissing off! And he's hooked! I'd like some information about this ad in the newspaper. I know nothing, Madame. We were contacted a while ago. The investigation is under way around Machecoul. But I can contact the lawyers in New Zealand, if you like? New Zealand? Oh my God! Who's looking for Louise Radiguet, so far away? A brother, I believe. A brother? We visit a house tomorrow. Count me out. Driving lesson. I promised to take Kevin to his mum's. Then I work out. So it's me again. One last effort. - Bedtime. - Good night. Me too. See you tomorrow, José. Good night, you guys. Cover up that monstrosity. It depresses me. Just good friends, eh? Sure, let's enjoy the moment. It's Corinne, she's like my sister. Girls always adore fancy theories! We shared a foster mother for 10 years. It counts. Around my navel. It's the best part of the day. Listen. They're off again! How's my Rosalinde? It's not a big house but show it to José and the kids. I love it. I'll buy it for you. Happy? Yes, very. Ever since I arrived, I come to meditate every morning in this wood... Where our whole family had that fatal car crash. Where did it happen? There, right by that tree, I think. My father was in the car, my mother, my grandmother, and little Louise... Your mother. I want mum. I'm here, darling. No, mum! Stop crying all the time, it upsets her. I'm coming, darling. I'm sorry. How did the crash happen? We'll never know. My sister was the only one left alive. How do you know? I was told. I can't remember exactly. My whole world crashed. I was crazy with grief. You had every reason. You know the rest. I abandoned everything. I was a coward. I didn't even ask if Louise was alive. It took me 50 years. With you, I feel I'm righting the wrong I did her. I feel responsible. But you weren't there? Of course not. Why do you say that? As you weren't there, stop beating yourself up. You're right. What's the use? You don't mind me telling you? Not at all. If it helps. Look out! There's a car. Where were you when the crash occurred? In a vile local boarding school. You know, I've been thinking, Louise. You and the kids mean a lot to me. Well... I'd like... I'd like to buy a big property in France and live here with you, and my dogs. I'll return to Rabbit Hill once or twice a year. But I don't want to be a burden. Talk it over with José. Before I inform Beaujard. Fine. I'll... I'll talk to him. Corinne, we're dead! He wants to settle here, with us and the dogs! How's your mum? You're like pale? I'm good. She needs to sleep. Lend me your scooter. What did you say when we wrote the letter? What did the little girl's brother do? That rascal? He put his hands over their daddy's eyes. Why? How should I know? It was so long ago. Cluck, cluck! Shouldn't they be in the hen house? They're God's creatures, like you and me. They can enter the House of the Lord. I remember! It's coming back... It was his revenge. They wanted to lock him up. In prison? How should I know? No. In the approved school in Artins. Fuck! So that's it. No! He never said he wanted to move in with us. Get it? Be civil! Where is she? No idea! It's her life. Is that all they do? Listen to ugly music? It soothes the baby. Give me a fucking break! Where were you? Why did he change his mind? I don't know. You haven't slept with him? You're sick! All I want is for him to go away. It's all unravelling! Charles! José! All against me. Even you. It's not fair. I'm through. It was your idea! Deal with it! Find a way to get rid of him. Any coffee for your old uncle? Anyone in? Anyone at home? Into the groove already? Surprise! Finished your bottle, love? Yes, every drop. You're here? Hello. I'll wake the children. Let them sleep. Just fix me a coffee, I need a pick-up. OK. Right away. Here. I'll be off. Why did you come so early? Why indeed? Yes! For the car. They delivered it. A hybrid. I'm "saving the planet". Not my choice of colour, it was a display model, so you'd have it quicker. Thank you. It must have cost a fortune. Yes... No... Here are the keys. And the children? Not today! I need to walk. And they're not children any more. Far from it. Come over for lunch. We must talk seriously. Hello. Did you find them alright? Perfect. Thanks again. She never told me but I knew it was nearby. Like a lift? Thanks. I'm going to Sainte Eulalie Manor. I feel a bit knackered. How's Louise's depression? She seems fine. And her husband is very attentive. She's found a husband? The secretive little thing! Well, well! So that's why she dyed her hair blonde! Good for her! Raising Elodie alone who got pregnant at 15, it's not an easy life. Rosalinde is sweet, but it's one more mouth to feed. I miss the three of them. And the son? She has no son. Or she didn't two weeks ago. Kevin? You've got it all wrong! You mean the lad who's always hanging around? He's the son of a nurse in Machecoul. His father's José, a handsome fella with a motorbike. Right. He's on with Corinne, Louise's cousin. You see? I see. Yes, very clearly. She's a piece of work. But she's the one who brings home the bacon. So they're cousins? In a manner of speaking. Both orphans, and they were raised together. That makes a bond. Of course. The old days certainly had style. Yes, indeed. Can I offer you a drink? Very kind but I'm not properly dressed. Next time. Goodbye, and many thanks. Don't we have to talk seriously? I wanted to discuss incest. I surprised your two in the bedroom, stark naked, bonking away. But I now know they're not brother and sister. Right? So they can fuck away. Who had the idea? You? No. You're too honest. José? No, too stupid. Your cousin Corinne? She's a shark, like me. That's why I can't stand her. But it couldn't have worked without you. With your angel face and golden curls. Amazing how a few curls can fool the wariest man on the planet. You deceived me, Louise. All the way. You're right. I did. So what will you do? Turn us in? And keep looking for the sister you abandoned on the roadside? You put your hands over your father's eyes! To keep out of a remand home. You're no angel either. You lie too. Here, take it back. I was ashamed to wear it. Do what you like. But not to the children. I won't do anything. We're quits. I was happy to do what I did for you. I'll return to Rabbit Hill as if nothing happened. Make up an excuse for my departure. I don't expect you're hungry? You can go. Louise! Your cell's always off! It's a drag. He came by the office. Our whole story's blown. He's not buying a house. The 3 kids get the lot. Not a cent for you. I hope the darlings remember us. They'll be loaded. Did he tell you? Vaguely. Go on. He's arranging their trip out there. Without us. I couldn't help asking him: "What have we done to you?" He burst out laughing! José won't like it. Rabbit Hill was his dream. Got a drink? I'm turning to alcohol. Yes, come on. You know me, I have an instinct. Either he sensed you didn't want him here, or he suspected something. I don't think so. Come clean, did you sleep with José? Never! You're my best friend. I don't believe it but never mind. Whose car? A gift from Charles. For José. You're kidding? Classy! He never said a word. We were an inch from the jackpot. And an inch from disaster. Nothing. Cheers! Delicious. And chilled. That's Charles. - Any left? - 3 cases. Goes fast, eh? And will go faster. Some time later You don't mind if we stay on a bit? It's so great here. Not at all. What do you do? Tell me. Charles takes us everywhere. Australia twice! I have English lessons. Zalinde swims. We go sailing. Paradise! Come and stay after. And Kevin? An internship in Charles's office. Still throwing up? Not any more. It's starting to show. You think so? See Corinne and José? - Hardly ever. - Where are they? Their place, I suppose. Got a new ring? Isn't it gorgeous? The stone's genuine. It was Louise's, his sister. She gave it to me. She arrived here a few days ago. I didn't dare tell you. Where is she? Now? On the veranda. There...
