PARLIAMENT WITH 40 MILES, THROUGH THE PEOPLE OF TURA THE SANDOR CASTLE - Good morning, Franz. - Good morning, Mr. Johann. Did you sleep well, sir? Very well. Thanks. I would like my hunting suit later this morning. And the shotgun, sir? Evidently. Thank you, Franz. - Good days. - Good day sir. Have there been more problems with the new washer? No sir. We've already learned how it works. The baroness continues to complain about the plumbing noise. Very noisy! - Mind that, please. - Yes sir. Oh yeah! Yesterday, His Excellency found a moth in his dictionary. Truth? - In the letters "them". - I'm sorry. - Use insecticide. - The tie! ... - Yes, sir. Where's your cap? It didn't sit well ... Forgets. You have to use it all the time. Yes sir. Get three dozen roses for the baroness this morning. - What about water lilies? - They bloom well, sir. Is there a Burmese "Hynostra" in bloom? A beauty, sir! Bring me. You can go now. It is the last day of the elections to Parliament. Those who have not yet voted will be able to do so today. Nothing else. No, no, Klari! The fruit salt to the right of His Excellency's bowl. If you're on the left ... will the world end? No, but His Excellency has his habits. It requires accuracy. You must get used to it. I am sorry, sir. I am as eager to do things as you are. Would you like... Yes. Hot water? ... Don't ever forget. The Count likes quick coffee. It is characteristic of this affected old man. Klari, the prime minister of Hungary is not affected. In the future, treat him with due respect. Nonsense! After all, he 's just an ordinary man, just like you. He never leaves the den to have some fun? ... Klari, don't get carried away by your imagination! Well, you can take that. Quick! - Everything served? - Yes sir. Sorry sir. - Precious, isn't it? - Indeed, sir. Ready. Good morning, Otto. Do you want to see your master? I believe it is possible. Hello, Otto! How are you this morning? - Good morning, Excellency. - Good morning, Johann. Come on, puppy! How handsome you are! Johann, would you do me a favor and fix my neck? With great pleasure, Excellency. It was enough! Thanks. Congratulations, Your Excellency. Whereby? For his electoral triumph. At my age, I should be wiser and leave politics, instead of wasting time with goons and parasites. Do you know, Johann? I envy you. It leads you to a healthy, simple and normal life. You don't care about the Policy. Without a doubt, you are completely happy, aren't you? How could it not be, Your Excellency? You are always very kind to me. Why shouldn't it be? Only you provide me with well-being these days. Also, keep my faith in human beings alive . All around me, I see only good old families that are degenerating. Children who only inherit the worst from their parents. However you, the Porok, continue as always. No changes. I remember your grandfather, who was our butler. A great person! And your father, too! And you, Johann, still retain the old qualities. Thank you, Your Excellency. Thank you, Johann. Between. Good morning, Mrs. Baroness. Good morning, Johann. Am I the last, as always? She is still the youngest, baroness. Yes, but now I'm a guest. If I may, I will always see you as a Baroness. - I only talked about it ... - Certainly. - How lovely to be woken up like that! - Thank you, Your Excellency. I hope you slept well. Oh yeah. I always sleep well here in the country. I sit a thousand kilometers from Budapest, not 65. And the vote in the village? How are you doing? Your father is ahead. Sure. However, the peasants ... ... are enthusiastic about my father? Naturally. Everyone works on their properties. - How are you, Johann? - I?... I mean ... didn't you get married or anything? ... No, Your Excellency. I didn't get married ... or anything. However, you must marry, Johann, so that your son may succeed you at my father's house. You represent a dynasty. The dynastic condition never occurred to me, Excellency. However, it is your duty, Johann. There are many robust and healthy girls who work here. Look for a good wife. Two working together, go further! Generally, baroness, we don't get very far. Oh, though ... What a mess! Johann, please! Good morning mom. In between. Good morning darling. - Thank you, Johann. - Yes, Your Excellency. What was Johann doing? I dropped marmalade. - How are you, dear? - Very well. I came to have my second coffee with you. You look great, Katrina. Excellent aspect ... Oh, I am. Everything was here, as if sleeping in the castle each night. The soft pillow, the pitcher of mineral water, the heater ... everything. Yes. Johann never forgets anything. Georg called. Will come for tea, maybe late. Always late, since he became a deputy ... He is grateful that he is dedicated to politics. Thus, you will be less concerned with actresses and racetracks. Why talk about it? It's such a beautiful morning! Why did you marry him? Your father and I did everything to stop it. I got married maybe for that very reason. If they hadn't, I think I would have seen how Georg is. Good reason, I suppose. Excellence... I'm noticing a flock of birds. Where? Behind those trees. Wait here, sir. Here it is Sir. Make them take flight. - One day the old man will get it right. - If you improve your aim, yes. Three more, Johann. It's not bad. It's not bad. His Excellency is in good shape today . There's an echo lately, haven't you noticed? I didn't hear it when I was younger. The echoes are variable, sir, like the weather. Apparently, the wind has changed. - Oh, Theresa! - Yes, baroness? Phone Mrs. Hales in Budapest. Tell him that I won't be able to go to the test. Then I will tell you. Yes, baroness. Thank you, Johann. I wish my mother would lend me you ... ... to take you to Budapest. I had many butlers, wanting one like you, but I couldn't. Maybe because I am a butler of breed, with a family tree. What is it? They are putting a microphone on the terrace. After the results, your father will make a statement. If I may ... it's almost tea time. Thank you, Johann. Do you think you could end up finding me nice? Nothing would be easier, Klari. So, what prevents it? The usual reason. Another woman?... Three. And all very jealous. And very dangerous. Yes, I had a lot of fun. Look, Katrina. Today ... the 14th ... - Quails? - Yes, quails. Very fat! It is a shame to share them with the servants. Johann always brings me luck. When you're with me, I hunt a lot. If I'm alone, almost nothing. Serve the tea. We will not wait for the baron. Good afternoon, Baron. Good afternoon, Theresa. Good afternoon, Georg. Nice to see you. Good afternoon, Georg. Good afternoon, my mother-in-law. Good afternoon, mother -in- law. How are you, dear? Very well. How about Budapest? Good? I was very busy, I didn't stop. And the election? Excellent, my father-in-law! Great! We won in the provinces. However, in Budapest, the latest results give six seats ... to social progressists! Six? Are you sure there are six, sir? Please, Johann, offer sugar to the baron. Yes, Your Excellency. I mean ... you are the ideal butler my wife talks about! ... Excuse me, sir. I lost control. Don't worry, Johann. Does not matter. - Could you offer us some sandwiches? - Yes, Your Excellency. I did not understand. Never in his life did he meddle! You are certainly interested, dear, like the whole country. Now, we all make mistakes, sometimes. After all, he is not a machine. It is a human being. For sure. Johann, turn on the radio. Do you have the right time, Georg? It is four and five. I believed I was late. They must announce the results of Budapest. That's right. ... were elected. In Budapest South, socialprogresists obtained 44,125 votes, getting 6 deputies. The first is Seandor Inchy. The second... Why did it? Excuse me, Your Excellency, but I must tell you something very important. It won't be so important that you can't wait. Turn the radio on again. As you wish, sir. The fifth deputy is Carl Peters. The sixth is Johann Porok. Porok's election is remarkable, as he is the butler in the service of the head of the conservative party, Count Alber Sandor. That's it for the moment. Johann elected to Parliament? It's unheard of! Is this right, Johann? Excellency, that was the important news I wanted to tell you. I can not believe! You cannot go to Parliament. I've never heard anything like it. What are we going to do without it? - Johann, come here. - Yes, Your Excellency. Why didn't you tell us anything about it? I am very surprised, Your Excellency. I was in sixth place, and we had three deputies. If your party is opposed, how can you continue to be loyal to us? Your Excellency, I will do my duty faithfully here. - My loyalty never wavered. - Yes. Well, dear mother-in-law, in our house we will not have such loyal servants, but only ... gentlemen participate in the discussions. You have no idea where it will end! ... There are educated people in Parliament. How will you handle the comparison? Excellency, as Baron Marissey has already implied, I am not a gentleman. Until you have time to get culture. What do you mean by that? Only, not being a gentleman, I don't have to play bridge or dance, and not even go to the races. Once you have time to ... To betray those who have fed you? If getting culture is a betrayal, the baroness is absolutely right. Education teaches loyalty, doesn't it? Without a doubt, baroness. In any case, I have not been disloyal to your Excellency. Believe me, don't you, sir? Of course, Johann. However, You threw me in a billiard pool! See? See? What will I do without you? You know my habits, all my weaknesses, it even brings me luck when I go hunting! Good or bad, I manage to govern the country. However, what to do with the shoes? And with the ties? What will I do? How can I teach another person what you have in your blood? However, this will not be necessary at all. Why not? You are no longer at my service, are you? Sir, when my party submitted my candidacy, I was a butler. You are a landowner and I will continue to be a butler. Although this does not hinder my political activity, I will consider myself fortunate to be able to continue at your service. Because? To be able to spy on my father and inform his party? Come on, you already know Johann. Everything is arranged, Johann. As far as I'm concerned, you can talk about politics as much as you want. I think I will like the situation. You will now be able to accompany me to Parliament. Now yes. Instead of a minister in my office doing things for me, ... I will have my own competent butler. Thank you sir. Everything remains the same. Do me a favor and pour me a glass of cognac to toast the scare. Yes sir. I hope you can trust him, Dad. There is no danger! Forgiveness, Your Excellency. The Radio is at your disposal. I'm going now. Are you coming, dear? Sure. I love to hear him speak. - Good afternoon, Excellency. - Good afternoon friends. We'll be broadcasting soon, sir. Sir, what about the text of your speech? Albert never prepares anything. Always speaks without thinking ... I mean... Leave it like that. It is the first time that criticizes me in 30 years. Sit here, dear. Silent, yes? Oh, yes, absolutely. Got it. 20 seconds, sir. I'm ready. Here Budapest Radio. We broadcast from the Prime Minister's castle in Sandor. We are on the stunning terrace of this venerable home and His Excellency, Prime Minister Albert Sandor, will speak to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I sincerely thank you your trust in me and my party. I will not abuse your patience by detailing our full program. In any case, it would be unnecessary. Our program can be summarized in one word. That word is "BREAD". Bread for everyone in the country. The party promises bread for everyone. We humbly thank you, Your Excellency, for your important message. And now, I can ask you, on behalf of the listeners, whether it is true that your butler was elected to parliament by the opposition? Yes, that's right. So I suppose, Your Excellency, that the new elected deputy is no longer in the castle ... Why not? Come on a moment, Johann. Will Johann speak? Why don't you ask for your opinion on the political situation? Dad, no! As you wish, Excellency. Would be very interesting. Please speak into the microphone, distinguished sir. I will introduce you. Ladies and gentlemen, let's now hear the newly elected deputy of the socialprogresist party, o Sr. Johann Porok. Compatriots, With much regret, I do not see the situation in such a favorable light as the prime minister said . Unfortunately ... Unfortunately, the control of ... ... government is in the hands of one party whose action consists of cowardice, in hoax and vile maneuvers. Mom, did you hear what he said? Shshshsh, you! Through conservatives, the situation of the working class has only worsened. That doesn't matter a party that charges ever-increasing taxes, drawn from people almost starving. Or social progressive party and I, as a member of it, we will do everything to end this deplorable situation, for which no one is responsible anymore than the Prime Minister, Count Albert Sandor. Dad, why don't you shut up? Last year, the count promised the people a chicken in each pan. The chickens did not appear. Even the pots paid taxes. Now promise us bread. Another vain promise! Compatriots, or social-progressive party does not promise to give bread to workers. They will be able to buy the bread! Thank you very much. Congratulations to the illustrious elected deputy. Thus the transmission ends from the prime minister's castle. Baroness? Johann, you should be ashamed! Yes, you should! Cognac, Your Excellency? Great speech, Johann! Magnificent! Thank you, Your Excellency. Many... Do I prepare a soft or starched shirt for this afternoon's rally? Congratulations, Katrina. It is the biggest party of the Fund for Children. Isn't it wonderful? So many people who come for charity! Did you come for charity? ... Sure! Why not? Honey, you're a charm! Katrina, don't hide it from me. You know very well that Johann Porok is the “whooping cough” of all Budapest! Don't be ridiculous! My father's butler? Katrina, dear. Come and have tea with us. We reserve a seat for you. Thanks. Did you like the dance? - Oh, yes, yes. - I thought she was wonderful. Me too. More tea? No, not now. Thanks. - I think I'll take a little more. - Good. What a lovely song! I can?... By God, yes! Thanks. Thank you. Sugar? As I said? Sugar? Yes please. How much? You can put. I will tell you when to stop. You know, I never diet. Beautiful music! And charming! - Maybe I should put more sugar. - Yes, baroness. Did you notice that elegance? And the voice ... how loud, how vibrant! And yesterday in Parliament? I haven't been there. Now, it was the most passionate speech I have ever heard. Not even my husband slept! There was never a deputy like him. I came in just because it was raining, and since then I almost never leave. - Sugar? - As I said? Yes please. Mr. Porok, what a magnificent speech you gave yesterday! I didn't understand a word, of course, but I loved it! Thank you, countess. It makes me feel so patriotic! Tell me, do you think you would have time to come to my house one afternoon and ... explain me about Politics? ... Perhaps on my free afternoon, countess. Johann, please, more hot water. Yes ma'am. Katrina, you have to hear this man speak in Parliament. Why don't you go tomorrow? I do not care. How can you say that? He's almost your family! It is not, and I will not go. Here you are, baroness. Thank you for your help. - It was a pleasure. - Thanks. Bye! 60 more, baroness, of the tombola. That makes ... 470. Double the last time. My friends are very generous. Yes. With a lot of desire to come. Of course, with the biggest attraction in Budapest, here ... Are you hurt, Baroness? Oh, it was nothing. I just twisted my knee. Take the money! Don't lean on that foot. Just a moment. It will pass. Let me go! A sprained knee is serious, baroness. Johan, please release me. This is ridiculous! Treat me like a girl. If the baroness puts her arm around my neck, she'll be more comfortable. - Sorry, Mrs. Baroness. - What happens? Countess Olga on the phone. The baroness cannot attend to her now. - Write down the message. - Yes, baroness. Thanks. Now ... if the baroness drops the sock, I'll get a warm cloth. I want cold. Sorry, baroness ... a warm cloth! I think I know what is best for me. I want a cold cloth! Yes, baroness, a cold cloth. That said? That you don't want to go with them. Tomorrow, to Parliament. Tell him not to. Can I help you? No thanks, everything is fine. Tell him that I will never go to Parliament! Nothing is gained by going to this horrible place. Oh, but it's hot! Yes, Mrs. Baroness. I declare the session open. These things cannot be done in one day. We did the best we could, under these circumstances, And in due time. everything will be rectified. Mr. President! The Honorable Deputy, Mr. Porok, has the floor. We ask for concrete measures, and what do we have? A number of words. We ask for decisions and get more words. Can our people live on words alone? Our honorable opposition opponents speak eloquently and with many details in going to the aid of the people. Fantastic, isn't it? One might think that, if the government continues with its current policy, the people will have nothing more. How are you going to help him? - Excellent, isn't it? - I'll tell Freddy everything. POROK CHALLENGES THE PRIME MINISTER AGAIN THE WEAPON ISSUE CAUSES PARLIAMENTARY BATTLE I don't know why you're taking me to Parliament! We could have gone on Christmas shopping. Mom, you need to open your eyes. He always stays at home and does n't even read the papers. You don't know what your dear Johann is up to. Why worry about Johann? Your father doesn't even bother ... Johann is playing cat and shoe daddy , and daddy doesn't react. Your father has a good heart. Too good. See, Mom. That your own butler will be your undoing! Just three months as a deputy and the government trembles every time it attacks. But what an idea! Johann attacking! Your father would not allow it. It is the same bill. They make false promises, and nothing works. Let them try to present it again. File it. Why don't you give speeches? They are not yet in session. I thought they talked all the time. Not quite, Mom! Never come here before? Never. I don't care about politics. I don't understand anything, And I'm surprised that you do. I don't care about politics. I hate everything related to her. However, someone has to protect Dad. I'll taste ... Who, your father? No, Johann. Why do you worry if it doesn't matter to Dad? I saw him the other day at the opera. In row 10. No, in row 9, in the center. What opera was it? I do not remember. He wore a very elegant outfit , dark blue, with a clove on the lapel. And with a superior air. I wanted to give him a slap. And it was not the first time. Last week, he called Dad a "political ventriloquist". Daddy, a ventriloquist? ... I was so furious that I almost threw this at you. Look. Here it is! Another new outfit. The ideal butler. Fix daddy's tie. Soon, it will cut your neck! - Nothing more, sir? - Nothing more, Johann. Now that you’ve packed my rags, go and turn me into a rag. I hope you understand. I don't attack him personally. I understand you very well. Do right. My wife and daughter are here today. There they are. I will do everything possible. Good Morning. Johann, how long are you going to continue working for the prime minister? Do not know. It demeans us that the party chief ... Downgrade us? Since when does work demean someone? After all ... what about dignity? Why serve someone who ... enslaves our people? The count does not enslave anyone. He's a good boss. It's an enemy! Does an enemy's tie fit ? Put a tie around your neck ... not a tie! I agree with you. Listen to me, once and for all. My work for you and my work for the count are different things. I have been loyal to the party. I never failed in any sense. And I intend to continue serving the Count until he dismisses me. I declare the session open. Read government bill number 482 ... "Bill 482, Third session. "It will be voted on by both chambers ..." What are you saying? I don't understand a word ... Do not worry. Nobody understands it. I didn't say daddy is a ventriloquist, did I? I thought I would find them here. Commander... - Can I stay with you? - Please. It is very kind. I never see her. Sometimes I think you try to avoid me. All your time is for Politics. What a horrible thing for a beautiful woman. Can't we go somewhere to have coffee? Won't you be interested in all the uproar down there? Yes. See, they're talking about the Katson stream. From the Katson stream? And what do you care about that stream? I like a lot. I fell in love since I was a girl. I will buy you a stream, just for you. I don't sleep anymore, I don't eat ... I vibrate in my uniform. If only I knew what's going on here! I kneel at your feet. Not here, please. Remember that I am a married woman! Katrina, do you want to break my heart by saying you're married? I definitely have a husband. See? Georg? That goon? Poor husband! He believes he is an irresistible Casanova. Silence! Can't you get out of here a little bit? Certainly not. - In that case, I have a meeting. Bye. - Bye. Look! Daddy will talk! Regarding the Agriculture Bill , I will say the following: Or conservative party promised that the law would pass this session. She will be. Difficulties will arise ... ... but they will be overcome. That's all I have to say at the moment. Mr. President! The Honorable Deputy, Mr. Porok, has the floor. The prime minister always makes promises to us. Without a doubt, I would keep those promises, if it weren't for the "difficulties" that are always arising. There has never been anyone so oppressed by "difficulties". I therefore suggest, for the Prime Minister, a higher degree. "Duke of Difficulties!" Dad like a duke? I hadn't heard of that ... Five years ago, the duke ... ... sorry, the prime minister, He promised us a "Retirement Law". However, we did not have the "Retirement Law". Why not? Difficulties! Four years ago, he promised lower agricultural taxes. However, they didn't. Why not? Difficulties! Three years ago, he promised to reduce armaments. But there was no reduction in armaments. Why not? Difficulties! Two years ago, he promised the population a chicken in each pot. However, we had no chickens. Why not? Difficulties! Last year, he promised land distribution. However, there was no land distribution . Why not? Difficulties! And now, this year, the political ventriloquist, Spokesperson for the oligarchy, It presents us with another series of bright promises. And, as always, he says they will have difficulties. You're right. He... Continue, Johann. You will have difficulties. In reality, they already have them. Their leagues no longer support the Count. Doesn't realize that they are slipping little by little. In reality, they have already slipped. The earl should take care of his leagues. However, let us leave it. The people of this country will not continue to support a party of an outdated time, run by a man who lets himself be used to cover an unfair, harmful and reactionary policy. The people of this country will not continue to tolerate the policy of the Duke of Difficulties. It's time to ... Who played? That was it! Him, who pretends to sleep. He did it, didn't he? Oh, fight, yes? Gentlemen, please! Dad, Dad! Get under the table! Let's go, mom! I do not believe! They will murder us cowardly! I believe this is over, for today. Or it's starting. Are we going, sir? Good idea. What an asylum! So your father ... ... want peace of mind when you're at home. - Go up, Mom. - Every day, imagine! - Katrina! - Daddy, okay? Yes, dear, perfectly. We will go home with you. I thought they would only make speeches. I didn't know it was like this! I believe this is yours, lady. Thanks. But, Katrina, what did he do with your bag? I think it fell from the hand of Mrs. Baroness. However, my dear Katrina, it is not a reason ... ... to fire you. He only did his duty. His speech was brave and resourceful. Including I agree with him. I give up. Everything he does is fine. I'm not so sure about that. The alloys ... One day I had to wait 10 minutes in front of the Parliament. There would be a meeting or something. It was the first time in my life that I had waited for a server. However, if he had a meeting ... Mom! Are you defending him now? Of course I defend it. It could have taken 15 minutes instead of 10 ... Well, now you don't have a meeting, and where's the tea? Johann, where have you been this time? Forgiveness, Your Excellency. I had to change my clothes. He spent his time changing, but he forgot about me. What do you want, sir? - My bath and my business suit. - Yes, Your Excellency. Where are you going? Serve the tea first. Come on, Katrina! Aren't you going to have tea? No, thank you. Why not? Moments ago I wanted to. Now, I've changed my mind. Where's the saccharin? I'm sorry, sir. I didn't put it on the table. Previously, everything was in place. I'll get it, sir. Good afternoon, my mother-in-law. Hello dear! Good afternoon, my father-in-law. Georg, we didn't expect it. Yes I know. I didn't know I was coming, either. - Tea? - No thank you. Can we speak privately? It's very important. How not. We'll call you later, Johann. What happens? I have news ... unpleasant for you. As soon as he left, and without warning, there was a vote of confidence, and you lost with that. They voted against me, didn't they? Daddy, you have to fire him this time! Is Dad no longer prime minister? No darling. Just a simple member of Parliament. I am not surprised, after what your butler said about you. Dad doesn't care. He had been ousted before. Johann got what he wanted. I will go to him. I can not understand. He was defeated by 14 votes. 14 votes, right? With our majority? Very strange! Well, sir, maybe it isn't. It's been a while... ... that a coalition cabinet is planned. Naturally, under the circumstances, no one wanted to risk his neck ... And why didn't you risk your neck, Georg? Well, I'm a little slow and I don't know how to improvise. You understand, don't you? Yes, I understand you, Georg. I could have invented something ... to prevent voting. Or maybe you didn't want to interrupt ... No, no, dear. This is something you don't understand. Yes darling. It is high policy. High politics! Let a butler defeat a prime minister! Being the bearer of such bad news, Georg, must be unpleasant. Didn't I do the right thing, sir? Who knows should ... You did very well. Now, at least, I will be able to live more calmly. It's great, isn't it, Albert? Now we can spend more time together. Go get dressed, dear. We will take a great walk And this afternoon we will open a bottle of champagne! Each time the government falls, his mother opens a bottle of champagne. In the past, we drank it. Now we just open the bottle ... Come on, honey. At least, you no longer need to be a ventriloquist! Well, tell me exactly what happened. Well, everything I said. In other words, Johann Porok gets up, makes "poof!", and the government sinks! Don't overdo it, dear. It wasn't just that. This has been preparing for a long time . Porok's hollow phrases mean nothing. Is not true. He didn't say hollow phrases. They were sharp phrases. Each word was relevant. Wait a moment! What will you do? If nobody says what they think of him, I will! Forget it, dear! In politics, you shouldn't worry about the past. Only with the future. If I'm sorry, I have to call. My colleagues and the press, of course, are waiting for me. The press, of course! - Did you call me, lady? - Yes. You ... I believe you are a brazen adventurer. A traitor and an ungrateful one. What else can I say to insult you? Whatever you want, baroness. Here, I shut up. I'm an employee. Yes. An employee who destroyed my father. As I said? Do not pretend. Today, as soon as we leave Parliament, there was a vote and they removed my father. Thank you, Baroness, for the news. Nothing disturbs you, does it? Keep working. Nothing annoys him. If I told you that you are the prime minister or emperor of China, nor blink! And the tray wouldn't shake, right? Probably not. No. You are a gentleman in disguise that sets an example before everyone of self-control. No, but if the tray shook, everything could fall and break, and it would be deducted from my salary. How smart are you! There's an answer for everything! If the baroness allows me, I prefer to shut up. Enough is silent. Now you'll have to talk! At your service, baroness. For years he has lived in this house. It has served us. He has been graciously leaning, but he never revealed the slightest hint of what he thought, your goals, your projects. Baroness, the housekeeper wants to buy a little house. The maid takes 5 years to save to buy a taxi for her fiancé. The gardener's son is studying medicine. He... What does it have to do with you? Only that. The servants of this house have dreams, hopes. Mrs. Baroness never expressed curiosity for them. Why would your humble servant be an exception? Say what you say, the truth is that he has attacked the man who gives him the bread. That's true. However, what I did was in the name of those who have no bread. What about the years you spent working for my father? Doesn't this house mean anything to you? Is it just an accommodation? This is very unfair, baroness. For me this house means His Excellency. Said by a butler ... it's not an honor, but I consider it a lot. Now, I think his policy is harmful . And his position as head of the government, very dangerous! Can I ask why? Because with your respectable name and your immense kindness, with your personal altruism, he practices a harmful and unjust policy . So I attack him with all my strength. Some politician would fall because of his faults. But, His Excellency is as strong as granite! So ... you have to dynamite him, don't you think? Perhaps, baroness. Where were you? Excellency, have you changed clothes yourself? I waited for 15 minutes, shaking on a towel, and you didn't come. You forgot your vest, Excellency. I couldn't find it. And the gray tie, sir? I couldn't find it, either. I couldn't find ... ...nothing. Can you tell me why you didn't come? It was my fault, Dad. We had a little discussion. A discussion? While I was shaking! I'm sorry, Dad. Well, goodbye, dear. I have to get back to the city. Because? You don't have to go yet. I'm going to take a look at my house. My servants are not as competent ... as yours. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye, Dad. Anything else, Excellency? Johann, I want to talk to you. I feel it, but it ca n't go on like this. I am forced to dismiss him. I am not surprised, Excellency. Since you were elected you have become a good member of Parliament, but in a badly used. I can't count on you any longer. There is no saccharin for my tea, my garters slip, my clothes are wrinkled, the beer is warm, and the bath is cold. Johann, you don't mind me anymore. Unfortunately, it is true, Excellency. Don't get me wrong. Do not believe it is because you attacked me in Parliament. I respect my opponents' convictions . However, I cannot drink warm beer and don't even trip over my leagues. The administrator will pay you. Very well, Your Excellency. Goodbye, boy! And thank you for serving me faithfully for 12 years. I hope we will see each other in Parliament. I hope so too, sir. Can I give my thanks to His Excellency for his kindness to me? - Now go. - Yes sir. Baron and Baroness Delavy. Sr. e Sra. Herman Baumgarten. The Count and Countess Kalusha. Sr. Emil Schmulz. Do you want to invite the widowed Duchess Zilcha? Why not? A duquesa Zilcha. Sr. e Sra. Adolf Eisen. Hello mom! Good morning darling. I hope I don't interrupt anything. Of course not! What do you do in the city? I came with Dad to change the air. Good Morning. Oh, my head! Do you have an aspirin? - Martha, providence? "Right now, Baroness." Oh, darling! What are you doing, Katrina? I make myself a good wife. Helping my husband to make his political ambition a reality. I'm going to have a dance. A dance? Oh, poor girl! Will we have to watch? Georg wants everyone to come. This is the idea. Blue blood mixed with red! What do you mean by that? Oh thank you. I believe you will have to lend me your servants. All but one. That's why my head hurts. Anyway, I didn't want to have this one. - Could not. Dad fired him. - What?... Yes. He left this morning. The migraine prevented me from communicating to you. I knew you would be happy. It was time! Let it be blown away! But ... who's going to take care of Dad? He only knows how to take care of others. This will be fixed somehow. It was well done! Do you mind, Mom, if we stick with the list? We're almost done. Not at all, dear. I'm going to take the aspirin. Okay, Martha ... Count and Countess Dubovski. Katrina, I have to be alone with you. It is very flattering, Commander, but ... could I trust you? Never. - Sorry, baroness. - Yes? The baron wants to see you now, in the parlor. - You said it's very important. - Very well. I'm sorry, Commander ... My husband ... Would you like to please tell me why one ... ... husband has more privileges than an old friend? I also wonder lately, commander. Did you want to see me, Georg? Which is? How beautiful you are tonight, dear! Yes I know. What is this very important subject ? It is not so important. I just wanted to tell you that at the last moment I invited a young deputy, just to drink ... you know, coffee. - Very well. As long as you're a public character, I receive people from all classes. One more, it doesn't matter ... Don't you want to know who it is? Not even. - It's Johann. - Who?... It's Johann Porok. I will tell the porters not to let you in. No. You always understood me and helped me ... Not this time! This time, I won't! Do you want to understand, dear? Porok is the man of the hour. Everyone flatters him. We should all give in a little. Don't talk anymore. and worse. Truth, dear, how sensitive you are! You know, I have a chance to be a minister. Doesn't that deserve a little sacrifice from you? You don't remember asking me to receive the one who was my father's butler? He is no more! And it has power! In addition ... I have precise reasons for inviting you. Certain circles do not treat you because you were a butler, but if you receive it well, even those circles will have to forget the past. I will not receive it! Baroness ... baron ... Good night, my dear Johann. I'm glad you came. In between. Isn't it nice, my dear Katrina, to have Mr. Porok with us? Yes, very pleasant. I'm sorry, but I have to leave them. It will only be for a moment. The baroness will take care of you. Honey, show him the house. Introduce him to our friends. I will meet with you when I can. Well ... shall we? I'll show you ... Thank you, Baroness, but I don't feel like it. Not? So, why did you come here? The baron spoke at a political meeting. He said 5 or 6 colleagues would be here. I came by order of my party. Gala dress? I went to a concert. I'm already seeing! Now, he is so esteemed that he goes to the concert in evening dress. No, baroness. It is Toscanini that I cherish a lot. Did you stop to think about what I would say about your presence here? I didn't know you would see the baroness. Please don't make your guests wait . I will wait for the baron here. As you wish. I will make you drink something . What would you like? Baroness, you are very kind. The last time I came here, at the behest of His Excellency, They offered me wine. Still have the same? Yes, however ... this wine is for the servants, not for the guests. Am I a guest? Forgive me, baroness. I hadn't realized. Please sit. Thanks. Let's talk? I believe it is customary to talk to the guests. - I'm very moved, Baroness. - Because? It is the first time that a member of my family he sits in the presence of a member of his family. It is a historic moment! Well, here we are, sitting down, facing each other, talking. It's the famous equality you're fighting for, isn't it? Tell me, was it worth fighting so hard for this moment? For me, widely. Do you smoke? Thanks. Abdula, with rosal leaves. My mother brings them from Nice. Yes I know. I smuggled them into the trunk. - Brandy? ... - Please. It is a 50 year old Armagnac. It came with cigarettes. Probably also in the trunk. Yes, it is, and in very good company. That is ... There were silk stockings, Chanel 22 ... ... and, oh yes ... and the lilac fabric for your robe. I spent several days looking for him. Truth? Did you shop for me? Very constantly. Mr. Conde always made me choose his gifts. I never imagined... I liked the little bracelet a lot. And the cream colored negligee. With the pink backstitches? It fit him very well. So ... you have chosen for me ... Yes, baroness. I hope the fabric was correct. Yes perfectly. What do you know about me! I have a little gallant advantage over you, Baroness. I know everything about you. Here ... it's hot !, don't you think? Shall we go to the conservatory? You've been a long way in the past few months, Johann. Did that make you much happier? I never wanted that, baroness. So why did you dedicate yourself to politics? He looked so happy at my father's house ... Each man dreams of something crazy. For example? For example, smoking a cigarette until the end. So far, I have rarely done it. Usually, after a ... ... swallow or two, just when it tastes better, ... I have to turn it off ... because someone rings the bell. I ask if the person who rings a bell at the top you'll have some idea of ​​the shrill bell sound down there. When it arrived, we didn't hold hands. Can we start over? You will see if your party's refrains come true. Liberty Equality Fraternity. Equality, because I offer you my hand. Freedom, why not let go. And fraternity, because ... I'm not bored at all. No, baroness. They continue to be refrains. There is no equality. I have never been more secure than at this moment. At this time? Yes. I am at your home as a guest. Offer me a chair, give me your hand. However, everything is in vain. I still don't have the courage to break the chains of a lifetime. I don’t have the courage to tell you why I wanted to acculturate myself, why I wanted to be more than a butler. I still can't tell you ... Johann, try to tell me that ... ... your ambition, your career ... ... all this did ... for me? I don't believe in miracles, Baroness. I always knew that nothing could put me by your side. Those are just words. Why are you telling me all this if you want nothing from me? Yes, I want something. What? I want you to listen to me. So, I will tell you, so you can hear it only once, and it's over! I love her! It's been 5 years, 10 years, since I can remember, I love her. However, I hate her because she can't see. It pity me. Because he is a coward, and lives with a man who despises her. Because? To save appearances. His whole life is a sham, a fraud. You are a spoiled, haughty and unfair girl. However, I love her. You understand? I love her! Now, expel me, please! I want you to expel me, do you hear me? If you don't ... Johann... Now, look! I wanted you to be kind to my guest. However, hospitality cannot go that far .... Katrina! Do me something like that ... Me! The widowed duchess Zilcha is gone, my love. She wants to tell you that she really liked the party. Very well. Excuse me please? I will go with you. Please sit. Thanks. A cigarette? Thanks. I hope you enjoyed the party. Very. I really appreciate you coming. My pleasure. I hoped I could have the opportunity to speak ... ... with you, but it may not be the right time. Sim... Yes, I think so. I believe it is the ideal time. I wanted to talk to you about something very important. Now it's ... very important. I have been watching you and your party with great interest. Very solid, very progressive. I completely agree with you. I enjoyed knowing it. In reality, I will join. Truth? Exactly, I hope to serve in a position that is ... Worthy of your ... skills? Exactly. Good evening. Good evening. I'm glad you came. Good night, countess. Good night, baroness. We liked a lot. Thanks. Good evening. Where's our daddy? Well, you know that he is averse to parties. Left... ...To the club. It will probably be wrapped in steam. Oh, the club? Guida, bring the car, please. Where are you going? I have something to discuss with ... ...my Father in Law. This is not something else, but ... ... politics, dear. Nothing you have ... ... to worry about that sweet little head of yours. Good night, my mother-in-law. Good night, dear. Come on, Johann. Make sure Daddy avoids drafts. You know that it catches easily. Come on, Johann! Oh, yes, countess. Good night, baroness. Good night, Johann. What are they up to with Dad? Johann had a strange face ... Something terrible has happened, Mom. What happened so terrible? And great, too. Terrible and stupendous ... how? What you mean? What happened? Well, Georg arrived in the conservatory when Johann and I were kissing. Village??? Did she eat something? Yes, Your Excellency. A good breakfast. Oh, this is good. Good morning mom. My dear and poor girl. I don't think you slept at all ... Oh no. I slept wonderfully. So it was the only one. Your father did not sleep. In Budapest, with all that noise, you don't sleep. Let's see if he comes back and tells us what happened. Maybe they are fighting a duel. Shooting! ¡The husbands are so dumb! Mom, sit down. It will make a hole in the carpet. Anyway, I'm old. I don't understand your calm. And I your nervousness. I have reasons. Look, I've always been by your side. But at night, Georg was right. How can you do that ... and let yourself be surprised? Tell me, mom ... When you were young, did you never want a much lesser man? Um, I think ... When I was young ... No, mom. We are women, both. Open the game. Was there no one? Let me think. Yes, there was one! - Who was? - An engineer. Does not fit. Was there no one more inferior? A wealthy farmer. Inferior. An artist who made my portrait. Inferior! A bricklayer? He later became an opera singer. Oh no. God help me! I already know! Your father campaigned across the country. After a speech, we had dinner at a farm. There was a ball. I danced with all kinds of people. A young peasant made me go round and round. They had never excited me so much, or made me spin like that. It was magnificent! Didn't you see him again? Yes. The next morning, at the market. I was selling ... cucumbers. Cucumbers? Yes I know. That time will never come back. He sold 10 cucumbers for 5 cents. Okay, mom. Now, imagine this. Suddenly it turns out that the young peasant was cultured, smart, charming. But he had opinions, a personality. But I tell you I was selling cucumbers. And personality, nothing. And if you bargained, I would give you 12 cucumbers for 5 cents. Come on, Katrina, how can you laugh knowing about the scandal that threatens us? Oh, dear, you cannot understand. No, eh? It is not the only one. I was also in love. Here it is. It sounds like the noise of Dad's car. You must be careful, dear. Your father is very worried ... - Good morning, Albert. - Good Morning. - Good morning daddy. - Good morning. I'd like a coffee. Yes Dear. I knew it. Said the ... ... bring it when it arrives. Come now. Well, what happened? We are very concerned. What happened? What did Johann say? And Georg? Georg? The new minister in the coalition cabinet? Georg ... in the office? Yes darling. Thanks to you. For God's sake, Dad, what happened? Georg agrees that you get divorced, without scandal, ... since Johann gets it ... ... your party accepted Georg as minister ... And what about Johann? - Leave the Policy. - What? And come back to work here! Great, Albert! No, honey, he wo n't be back here. Not?... And now this? I have no spoon ... Go get a spoon! Sorry, Your Excellency. But Dad ... this is all ridiculous! Johann renounces his goals, his ideals ... and for what? For your reputation, young lady. Nonsense! Just because I kissed you? Whether it was less important than a kiss, or the most discreet place ... Don't let him do that. What do I care about Georg and the stupid scandal? I wouldn't have you right ... Yes I have. This concerns me too. Albert, how does it concern you? Yes. Yesterday, before all this happened, I proposed Johann to the post of minister. It was very kind of you, Albert. But, don't you see what situation puts us all in? They deduced that I make my former servant a minister, for the sake of my daughter. In addition, think of the unpleasant things they will say about your father. After 40 years of public life! It's incredible! Why do we take it? Unfortunately, the rent is taken by her husband, a very ambitious man. I will not allow it! I believe it is too late to do anything about it. Everything is decided. Johann will propose Georg to Parliament at noon. By noon? Today? Yes darling. Katrina! What are you going to do? Where are you going? Daddy, stop her! This is now Johann's business. Oh, if only Georg hadn't gone to the conservatory ... And you who do not intend to stick your nose in politics! As I said?... - Good morning, baroness. - Good Morning. - Do you want me to drive? - No. I will drive. - Is Parliament already in session? - Yes ma'am. - Just a moment. Who do you want to see? - Mr. Johann Porok. He hasn't come down yet. Where is your office? First door, on the right, second floor. Thanks. Enter please. Johann, you can't do this ... I hoped you only knew ... after the result. I do not want to know. I won't allow it. It is the only way out. Your husband wanted to make a big fuss, and we woke up ... Johann, however, cannot give up all his goals, his dreams. It's absurd! Think of all the people who trust you, who believe in you. Who will take your place? There are others. There is not, you know very well. You were born to command. And I won't let you sacrifice yourself just because ... my husband ... I believe that only I have to decide. However, don't you realize? You are going to do something I don't care. Do you think I care what they say? However, it matters to me. Johann, please don't argue. I was very wrong. Now I know I'm right. What happened at night, was it serious? All? You know very well. I love him. However, I do not want to harm you, but help you. Do you know. Sim. Do you really love me? I will never stop loving you. So you won't screw up? Will you do nothing you will regret? No, I promise. Putz! Again?... Katrina! This is already over the limits! I am not surprised that it will yield in Parliament. Goodbye, baroness. Please don't worry about anything. We will? Nothing is missing! Come on, honey? I wouldn't miss it for the world! Let me. Well, shall we see what will happen? - Everything will be fine, Mom. - How was it? Johann is not going to propose Georg as a minister. I got it. Thank God! Katrina, I still don't understand ... Mr. President! The illustrious deputy Mr. Porok has the floor . With the new tax program, and the control of cultures at stake, the country demands an unity government right away. Therefore, with permission from the Chamber, I will not observe the usual procedure and I will propose to the hemicycle a candidate for the last vacant position: the Minister of Commerce. This position requires peculiar talent and political skill. Are you talking about Georg? It can not be. He promised me he wouldn't. The man I am going to propose is to combine these qualities. In addition, I know that he is an astute and skilled politician . Yes, he talks about Georg! A man who doesn't notice anything to reach his goal, who would sacrifice everything for his social position. It happens that you are a member of a large and distinguished family in the country. I refer to the illustrious deputy, Baron Georg Marissey. Johann, why don't you tell the truth? Yes, Johann, say it! Mr. President! I demand that the rostrum be evacuated! Everything you said is a lie! He knows! Katrina, cale-se! I won't shut up! Sir, you can't do anything? It's your wife. It depends on you. It's irregular! By favor, deflate the rostrum! Order! Order! Tell me why you did it, Johann. Say we love each other. Please, baroness. I demand that you expel these women. Johann, if you don't say what happened, I'll say it! Baroness, I pray, please don't! This is a scandal! Call the guards! Let them expel them! Shut up, Georg! Silence! Silence! Why should I shut up? Everyone is talking! Mom, please. Mr. President, can I say what is behind this? Mr. Porok sacrifices himself to no avail. And it harms the country. They know Johann Porok well. You know I would never propose my husband, ... ... Baron Marissey, for such a responsibility ... ... unless you were forced to do that. And that is what happened. He's trying to save me. Johann has been living at my father's house for years. You have known me since I was a girl. However, only last night, we discover that we love each other. I kissed him. My husband saw us and took this opportunity to rise politically. He offered me a divorce without scandal ... ... as long as Johann recommended him to ... ... the council of ministers and then resign. Gentlemen, that is absolutely true! Now choose: Between Baron Marissey or Johann Porok? Powder! Powder! Powder! - They chose you, Johann. Congratulations! - Thanks. Thank you sir. - Good day sir. - Good... Good Morning. You're the new maid, aren't you? Yes sir. I hope to be of your complete satisfaction, sir. No ... I wouldn't be surprised. How do you like your toast? Hot. How do you like your coffee? Too hot. How do you like your maids? Like you, Mrs. Porok!
