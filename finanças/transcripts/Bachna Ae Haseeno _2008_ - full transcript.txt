People might tell you not to love me. l'm very bad. l can steal your sleep, sweep you off your feet. l can hold you in my arms and make you lose yourself. l can cook up stories. Wherever you hide your heart, l can steal it in.. ..a couple of meetings, with a few words. Beware, O beautiful ones.. l've arrived.. Beware, O beautiful ones.. l've arrived..

Whenever it happens with someone.. ..it changes one's life.. ..the heart starts beating faster and makes you sigh. lt gives you sleepless nights.. ..one tends to daydream.. ..it teaches you what it means to love someone.' lt teaches you how to take those seven steps.. ..which lead to the journey of seven lives.. lf you're lucky, you find your love, in just one shot.. My case is different.. l am a killer.. l found this love three times.. 1996.. it was a fantastic year. Thanks to Narsimha Rao. l at least knew three such people.. ..who had Motorola cell phones.. And Sachin and l can now ask for Pepsi with style.. ..during the interval of every movie. 'Cut to April 1996.. and now, me, Sachin.. ..Pico and JB left for Europe with style.. ..through the affordable package of Dhingra tours.. ..and travels private limited..' To see Europe and its girls.. Hey, what's this.. There are only cows.. ..and grass in the entire Switzerland, and mountains.. Wrong! Zero on ten.. imported cows, imported grass, imported mountains. Hey, Raj, my score.. Hey, Sachin, my game.. it's your fault.. ..what will l do with the imported grass? Where are the imported girls? You should thank me, it's the cheapest tour. Then even the girls would be the same.. Yes, not a single girl tried to entice me as yet. You fool.. Hey, call me JB, atleast it sounds cool. Okay, so now l'll have to lie.. ..that l went around with 4-5 girls during this holiday.. 'But l didn't know there was a sweet.. ..romantic girl in the same train.. so romantic.. That after watching 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge' 1 7 times.. ..she left on Eurail.. hoping that.. ..she might also find her Raj, like Simran One finds a hero quickly in films.. ..but this entire tour is about to end. l am unfortunate. l will have to go back and quietly marry the hosiery .. ..prince from Ludhiana, district Phillaur Hey, even the hosiery prince will do.. ..it's just that he must look like Tom Cruise. Smiles like Shah Rukh. Has eyes like Aamir Khan.. Has voice like Amitabh. And romances like Raj.. Mahi! DDLJ again? Raj doesn't exist. Maybe he does exist.. Where are you going? To find Raj.. l am going to the bathroom, you fool.. l'm going to the bathroom. Why are you announcing Raj? Excuse me.. Sorry! Sorry.. Guys, there's a beautiful girl in the train.. Hey! There's a very cute boy in the train.. Where? - There.. Friends, brace yourselves.. 'Love in Switzerland'.. .. mission begins at the next station. Hey are you watching a film? Give it to me.

Oh no, l chose her. ls it a school bus seat that you're choosing ? Hey, Sachin.. Sachin! So? Did you find out anything? Yes.. the toilet is outside, to the left. What?! Did you go and find out about this? lf you're so confident then go.. and find out directly from the girls' parents.. Best of luck, l am going to the toilet.. Hey.. Where have these parents landed from? From Punjab.. - Now? Now say thank you. - Why? l've got all the information. What are you saying? The one in pink.. - Pinky? No, Sweety, she plays basketball at the state level. She's sporty.. how sweet! Hey you too are a cute basketball.. And the one with the specs is Mona.. ..English honours from Amritsar University. Forget about them, tell me about mine. Mahi.. Mahi? Huh? What have you to do with the name? Do you want information or not? - Sorry.. tell me, tell me. She's looking for Raj.. Why? Why is she looking for me? l haven't done anything as yet.. You know that movie, ' Dilwale Dulhaniya Lejayenge'? lts hero, Raj. All girls are crazy about him. She seems crazier than the rest. l didn't get you. Who was in that film ? Shah Rukh Khan! - ls she looking for Shah Rukh? No, you fool..! Her romantic hero! Two hearts unite on Eurail. Like it Happened in that film. lt was all rubbish. Stupid Hindi film. l went off to sleep. Tell me the story. Whose? About the movie.. about Raj.. But narrate it in short. ls it emotional? Do you want to listen to it or not? - Sorry, sorry, narrate Sure? - Yes, sure, sure. Preeti, did you hear? What? Nothing. Thank you, Thank you . lf he's singing, that doesn't mean he's Raj. Whoever he is, he's very cute. lf your papa sees that, then you'll be dead.. Cute, huh! Come on, we have to click photos too. You go ahead.. l'll see you directly on the train. Go on! Where are the girls? They are in the front seats. Deal the cards. Where's Mahi? She must be with uncle and aunty behind. As aunty always forces her to play cards. Stop! Please! Papa! Shit.. Mahi.. stop. Where's the chain? Oh, hi! Yes, we are in the same train. We were.. The train is gone. We've Missed it. What do you mean? Don't be silly.. l am not silly, you're blind. lt was here, right? Now it's not. What does that mean? But.. how is this possible? This is a foreign country.. ..how can we miss the train here? Now? l'll help you. Don't worry, l'll talk to the station master, he'll pass the message to your mummy and papa.. ..and that we'll meet in Zurich. Ok? Thanks.. Oh.. by the way, l am Raj.. Raj? And.. Oh! Sorry! l am Mahi. l'll just be back. Wow! What a name mummy has given me. Raj! Hi! Excuse me. When is the next train to Zurich? 6 in the evening.. And the next one after that? 6 in the morning. Did you find out anything? The next train is at 6. 6? That means just in the next three hours? Thank God. Err.. 'We're in Switzerland, just Mahi and her Raj.. and cows and their grass.. You shouldn't tell the truth at such a time, dear..' No, 6 o'clock tomorrow evening. We'll have to go to Zurich by bus. Why a bus? What if don't reach on time? We'll rent a car now.. ..that too an open air one. Huh?! Hey, why are you wasting time.. l have just one day.. we got to board a flight from Zurich tomorrow.. come on.. c'mon.. Oh! Sorry Mahi! The heroes in the movies have a lot of money.. You need to make do with a scooter in real life. l spent all my money on this scooter, how much do you have left? l just have some pennies left. That's it. How will we manage without money? We'll manage. Why do you worry? You're with me, nothing will go wrong.. Why? What's the guarantee.. Good things happen to good people.. l don't agree. What? That l'm not nice? No, that everything good happens with you. Didn't you fail in Maths.. - No. Hasn't your pocket money ever been cancelled.. Didn't anyone rag you in front of everyone in school? Didn't you ever have pimples?-No . Hey, you're an alien.. No.. l am just Mahi.. when l wasn't prepared for the Maths exam.. ..the exam would get postponed.. ..if l didn't like any girl in my school.. ..her father would get transferred to some other place.. ..if l liked a pink sandal in the shop.. ..then unless l got my pocket money.. ..that sandal wouldn't be sold.. that's how l am.. very lucky.. You're not so lucky.. you missed the train, didn't you? So what's unlucky about it.. 'Hey, Raj, you're really lucky.. either she's too smart, or she's a fool.' You'll know your good luck only when both of us starve to death.. So many flavours.. l know.. Mint flavour, strawberry flavour, look at that! Blackberry. How will it taste? What do you mean by that? Let's go and try it.. ls it your uncle's shop.. when he sees you, he'll say, son.. ..it has been ages since you've come.. you've become so weak.. ..come and have chocolates for free.. What else.. Oh gosh, he will get beaten up.. Can l try this one? Actually that one.. Can l try this one? That one please. This one.. This one.. No! l didn't like any of them.. what about you? Nah! So shall we leave it? Are you open tomorrow? Hurry up and run, Raj! - Run! Run! Come on Run Fast! Hey! Just a minute.. Wish.. Make a wish and blow it. lt will come true. Children do this. Absolutely not.. am l a child? l do it. Ok.. ok.. fine.. Come on, close your eyes.. and make a wish.. Shall we leave? Hey, aren't you interested in my wish? l am, but l do not want to hear. Huh! What logic is this? Wish logic! You shouldn't tell anyone after you make a wish. Why? Because the wish doesn't come true then. This means if l ask for the opposite and then tell you.. ..its opposite will come true. Huh.. What logic is this? Wish logic. 'What is this, we jumped from the train.. ..we finished all the money and we'll even reach Zurich by morning.. and l didn't even hold her hand, like a fool.. And as usual, l cracked a killer idea What happened? - l guess we've fallen short of fuel. What?! - Yes. What do we do now? - Nothing. You were boasting about your luck. Now let's find a clean place, wait for the morning, talk sweet.. Till morning? - Yes. - Are you crazy? Let's go. We'll find someone ahead, who can help us. C'mon! - Hey! Miss Mahi. Oh God.. how do l explain it to her.. Come on hurry! Come on! Aren't there any people here? Senorita, statistics says that there are.. ..9 cows to every human in Switzerland. You might find a cow in the next lane.. ..but it's impossible to find a human. What nonsense! Hello! ls anybody there?! Hello! l'm going to sit here, you can go ahead and search for humans. Do you know? When l was a kid.. ..l used to think that stars are God's light bulbs. You're still a kid! When l was a kid.. ..l used to think that l'd be an astronaut when l grow up.. ..l'll fly in a rocket and like Rakesh Sharma l'd say.. .. that lndia looks the better than the whole world. Stupid, isn't it? No.. it's not stupid at all.. that's sweet.. Raj.. l.. l want to say something to you.. 'Finally..' l'm going to get engaged. Oh.. Papa has searched for an alliance.. Oh.. He belongs to our community.. Oh.. From Lawrence road.. Oh.. Mahi, l've to confess to you. We didn't run out of fuel. l purposely stopped the scooter in a desolate spot. l'm sorry.. Mahi.. l'm sorry.. l didn't know that your engagement.. ..l'm sorry.. the petrol in this scooter just didn't.. .. finish so easily come on. No! No, wait! Won't you ask me why l did so? lt's not a wish that won't come true if l tell you. Mahi, l really didn't know that you're.. ..getting engaged but actually.. l've written a poem for you. See! l knew you'd laugh. No, no.. l'm sorry. Please recite it. No.. forget it. - Please.. You won't laugh, will you? Nowadays one finds angels travelling by train.. ..eating chocolates, making you dream casting a spell.. .. and then disappearing from Switzerland to lndia. l told you it's stupid. - No! Although l was aware of Everything Since.. since l've seen you.. l don't Know what has happened to me.. l've.. never felt like this before. Same here.. it's a strange feeling, isn't it? Are you scared? Not at all.. l knew.. that l'd find my Raj.. Then why didn't you tell me that before.. ..l dragged the scooter 4 kilometres unnecessarily.. lt's your fault.. l told you.. ..if you be with me, everything will be good..

Year 2002. Place, Bombay. Mumbai.. l hadn't seen a city as rocking as this. Live your own life.. ..no one's got anything to do with you.. do what you feel like.. ..people around you don't even know your name.. ..everyone's busy in making money and chilling out.. like me.. ..it had been one year since l returned from Delhi.. ..because l got a job in Microsoft. That means, money, fun, and.. and Radhika. My Radhika. She was from Ranchi, clothes in the suitcase.. Some money in the pocket.. and with a dream.. of being a film star. She's become a hot shot model and my girlfriend in just one year.. Excuse me, live-in girlfriend. Live-in means without getting married, cool, ain't it!' Babe.. coffee.. What else does one want? Love, affection? l have it! l have friendship, love, chemistry, biology.. l have everything what a person wants. Without any commitment. This is called killer fate. Which changed just sometime back.. Sometime back. Till now l was living as a Paying guest with Sachin.. ..after saving some money l could now afford a small flat of my own. Hey, what fun! After tolerating Sachin, his dirt.. ..and his nonsense for one year, my own house. Now l and my bed will often speak to each other.. ..had you slept, then this would have happened.. Hey.. who's it? Hey, you! Decent people are trying to sleep here.. put off the music.. What's your problem? Hello, madam, you have a problem.. are you deaf? Excuse me? Are you deaf? - Yes. Very funny!

Please. Sorry? Okay.. l'm sorry.. l didn't know about your working hours.. lt's cool, really, no problem.. it's not your fault.. Ok bye.. Hello! lt's not my fault.. which fool would like to sleep if she keeps him awake? And who else will a person love, if not his neighbour? Do you have sugar? 'After four months, we've united, we own two flats, but live in one room. Forever, l mean, not forever in that sense, forever for a while..' 'Forever for one and a half year. Baby, coffee.. - Thanks, sweetie. Today both of us are happy with this situation. Who knows the future, boss?' 'This was bound to happen. Sachin and l worked hard.. .. for the past three years and today we've developed.. .. such a rocking game software that ' along with us, even our foreign bosses were happy with our work. Welcome to the team, mates. See you in Sydney! To Sydney! And the blonde girls in Sydney! To dollars. And girls! To Australian places.. And girls in those places! Hey, we're going to have fun out there, and not to get married. Then sister-in-law? - Which sister-in-law? Hey, Radhika. What happened to her? She loves you. - So? So? Won't she come to Sydney with you? Why? Because.. you're a killer! She lives with you.. We've combined our flats. We haven't got married. Hey, you're doing that again? What do you mean? You know what l mean. You've planned to ditch her. And l bet you mustn't have told her about Sydney too. l'll tell her, why do you worry? She's going to worry you now! Relax! You don't know her. She's a very modern girl. Just think, she lives with me even before getting married. She doesn't believe in these old-fashioned things. Two tequila's please.. What are you saying? Every girl believes in these old-fashioned things. They plan to get married right from the beginning. Those girls are really cruel. They're cool first, and then, fool. No, Radhika isn't like that. More than me, she's interested in her career. She wants to become a heroine at any cost, will she get any job in Australia? What will she do over there? Crossover films? Don't be a fool, have your tequila. lt's going to make no difference to her. l promise. l'm sorry.. l should've told you earlier. But l didn't know about it myself. We heard the rumours, but didn't believe them. But it's sure now, Sachin and l are being transferred to Sydney. ln five weeks, we need to arrange for the work permit, etc. too. l know everything happened all of a sudden.. l hope you understand, baby.. We'll have to get married in court. We don't have time for a fancy wedding. Everything will have to be done in short, in five weeks. Oh God, that's why you looked so stressed! Don't worry, baby, l am there. l'll handle it all.. We'll have to get it registered in court, you'll have to come for that.. the things in the house.. l'll give it to Anushka.. Oh my God.. this is so exciting.. we're going to Sydney! Mr. and Mrs.Sharma.. in Sydney. But.. but.. your career? Raj! Come on, baby! You know you're most important for me. A little sacrifice a little compromise.. .. this is what marriage is all about. l am with you, l don't need anything else. Today is such an important day for you.. l'm so happy.. l wish mom and dad were here today.. Anyway, you're here.. what else do l want? 'What's happening with me? Why is this happening? What do l do now? Sachin.' Mummy! What?! Are you mad? What can mamma do? Everything! Your mummy is your secret weapon. Use her anyhow. Tell sister-in-law that your mummy is a witch. What are you saying? My mamma is so sweet. You know that, but sister-in-law doesn't. Tell her she has selected a girl for you, from Bhatinda. From Bhatinda? Does it make any difference? Say from Phagwara.. Sorry, sorry. The word 'mother' has a lot of strength, just take your mother's name, sister-in-law out. Firstly, stop addressing her as sister-in-law. l was just.. getting habituated to it. Don't get habituated to bad things, my brother. Mummy Please Forgive me! By the way Congratulation - Happy lndependence day! Really? So sweet! Oh, he's here, just a minute, aunt.. sorry? Mamma.. thank you.. hold on, mamma.. So, you used to urinate under a tree in Cunnoor?

Mamma wants to talk to you.. Yes, mamma. Yes, mamma, promise mamma, sorry mamma.. 'Yes, yes, yes.' 'No, no, no.' Kids! What?! Every woman's dream is to have a few kids around her. Buntu and Chhotu trouble her all her life. Go and tell her. Sorry, not possible. l lost the ability to produce children when l was a kid. Are you mad? Hey, l'm not challenging your manhood. Just say, there are just production hassles. She will never marry you in this life. Who'd like to use a damaged product? Killer idea. Amen. What do you think? A blue.. or a grey tie? Definitely blue.. very Shah Rukh at Filmfare.. l can never be a father. When l was a kid.. from the cycle.. sorry, not possible.. damaged goods. Why didn't you tell me before? How.. could l.. l couldn't.. l mean. l can't handle it myself.. so many tests.. still not possible.. l.. l'm sorry. Please give us a minute. 'ln just one minute.. my life will change in just one minute. ln just one minute, l'll be free.' Baby.. do you know how much l love you? Like.. every girl, even l have a dream.. to have a house, a loving hubby, and two children.. my children.. l understand.. No, baby, you don't understand. l want that family, but with you, l want children, but with you. We love each other so much that our .. ..love won't be insufficient for anyone.

Why? l don't know.. since a few days, l feel you're behaving very strangely with me. Almost as if you're not Raj.. someone like Sachin.. l don't know.. what's wrong with you? ls something wrong? 'This is the right opportunity, boss, tell her..' Radhika.. actually.. Am l doing something wrong? l'm trying my level best so that .. ..everything goes perfect. Our wedding, our life, but l don't know why l feel that you're not happy, with me, with us.. 'Why? l mean, why? ls it necessary to cry? No argument, no discussion is complete without this. Tears flow and wash off a guy's life.. Baby.. don't be silly, it's nothing like that. You know l love you.. l'm so stressed these days, new job, new responsibility.. And also you've become so emotional. l'm sorry. No, it's okay. Are you sure? l'm sure. You're happy, aren't you? No! Of course, baby.. l am happy. Very happy.

You just don't get it, do you? l don't believe in marriages.. there's nothing lacking in my.. ..life that l need a husband to fulfill it.. l don't say that all girls are wrong.. ..but this is right for me.. marriage? No way.. You're something else, you know. l know. Let's leave? The meter is running.. it might have touched 50 dollars or more by now. Meter? You kept the meter on?

What are you doing on Saturday night? Why? Do you need a taxi? No. lt's a launch party.. will you come? Cool. Do you have proper clothes? l don't.. should l not come? No, no, come, clothes make no difference. More spaghetti.. So like l was saying, he's the one who actually created the game. And he's the one made the weapon? - Yes. The weapons are basically these big guns.. ..we created these new weapons that when firing.. l haven't played much with the Xbox.. ..but l've heard Xbox 360 rocks? But have you heard about the Xbox Live? The online multiplayer system - Yes. By Xbox 360.. oh, l love that, l play it with my friends all the time. Taxi driver?! You brought a taxi driver along? l agree that she's beautiful but you, with a taxi driver? She won't change even if you say that repeatedly, you fool.. ..so what if she's a taxi driver.. she's educated, intelligent.. Even my watchman is intelligent.. l don't bring him for parties.. Why are you over reacting.. Won't l? You used to be a killer.. ..now you behave like a fool.. you work the whole day.. ..and then taxi driver.. you've brought a taxi driver along? What's wrong with you? She's not your types.. ..you yourself said she's the intelligent types.. Right?.. You're worrying needlessly.. she's my friend.. l hang around with her. Hang around? Brother, she's a girl since.. .. when have you started to hang around with girls? Remember, girls are preys.. and not friends.. 'Sachin, is not keeping quiet for once.. ..he's not letting me concentrate.. God! She's looking so beautiful.. you know, l never noticed her hair..' Hey, Raj! - Huh? l've been barking for half an hour now.. Hi.. l hope l'm not disturbing you people. No, no, we were waiting for you.. ..we have no topic left to talk to each other. - lsn't?

The promises we made to each other.. we'll be together.. ..we'll have fun.. with every girl in the world.. .. you know what l mean.. marriages are meant for fools.. .. you have no idea what you're talking about.. ..what's wrong with you? l'm in love.. with Gayatri.. You used to say that we've only done the wrong things.. ..in life, now l'm going to do something right. l love Gayatri, l want to marry her.. l have no one left in my life except you..you are my friend, my brother.. ..that's all l came to tell you.. Now you sit.. chill.. drink beer.. l am going. My life is waiting for me.. Okay, now? No.. just a second.. okay.. now! - l've had a lot of fun all my life.. you know everything.. ..you've changed me and my life completely, Gayatri.. l love you a lot.. l'll always do.. forever.. .. the old-fashioned one.. not the forever used these days.. Whose warranty gets..years after marriage You make life simple.. Gayatri, marry me! Gayatri? You are joking.. Right? No, Gayatri. l'm serious. l am proposing to you, Gayatri.. Please don't do this.. Don't spoil it! What are you saying.. l want to marry you How is that trying to spoil everything? l'm sorry.. it's all my fault, l think l let it go too far. l think l.. Gayatri, what are you talking about? l'm sorry, maybe l created a wrong impression on you. l.. don't understand.. Gayatri, l am talking to you about marriage.. Raj, l've already told you.. l don't want to get married.. l don't believe in marriages.. But.. But you thought it was all just small talk? l talk to the point, Raj.. l have never lied.. ..it's about my life.. and l want to live it on my terms.. ..tell me, will you allow me to drive taxis for my MBA? No, right? Will you let me work in a grocery store? No, right? Today you might allow me to do what l want.. ..and you won't stop me.. .. but let's get real, some or the other day you'll surely tell me that.. .. you earn a good amount and you'll pay my fees.. .. why do l need to do all this? Why do l need to come late everyday? Why l don't spend time with you.. l need it.. l want to live the way l want to.. l have to do everything on my own, on my own merit, l don't want to lose myself for someone else's thoughts.. But.. but l thought you loved me, Gayatri? Of course l love you, Raj.. but what has that to do with marriage? Everything.. Gayatri, even l used to think like you.. .. but since l've been in love with you, everything has changed.. But nothing has changed for me, Raj.. l'm sorry.. ..perhaps, l don't love you the way you love me.. ln fact, if love is marriage, then l think l don't even love you.. Gayatri.. just listen to me.. lf you think l'm being in a hurry, if l'm pressurising you.. ..then l'm sorry l'll slow down.. l'll wait the state l am in, even if you need your entire life, l'll wait.. ..forget that l ever said something to you.. ..forget it forget the candles forget everything.. How should l forget? All this.. l'm sorry, Raj.. ..perhaps, l won't reach that stage where you are.. ..my answer will be the same.. ..the moment you are ready to wait for, all your life, l don't have that moment to give to you.. l'm sorry. Shit! Why am l crying? What's this, Raj.. why are you crying.. ..you're a killer.. nothing happens to you.. Nowadays one finds angels travelling by train.. .. eating chocolates, making you dream, casting a spell.. .. and then disappearing from Switzerland to lndia. You know that you're the most important person in my life.. A little compromise and a little sacrifice.. .. isn't this what marriages are all about? You are with me, l don't need anything else in life.. l am just plain lucky! We both love each other so much that we.. ..won't fall short of love for anybody. Since the last two weeks you haven't answered my calls.. ..nor have you come to office, nor have l seen your face. And suddenly you are leaving.. l don't understand anything! Don't stress.. l am not stressed.. l am finding it difficult to understand.. l am going to apologise to Mahi and Radhika.. Try and understand my position.. ..l am ageing.. it takes time to comprehend things.. ..and l still haven't had a drink.. ..let me ask once more with feelings.. why? Because now l know how it hurts when you love someone.. ..and that someone rejects you.. it really hurts. Basically, you're doing all this to get back Gayatri, aren't you? No, Gayatri won't come. She doesn't love me. l am going to clean up the mess l have made in my life. Don't know why it doesn't make any sense. You are going for a world tour for something you did ages ago? That's strange.. Strange but true. Look its simple Sachin, when my heart was broken it was.. ..then l got to know painful it is, how heart-broken a person can be.. ..when someone treats you like Raj.. ..and till l don't ease their pain l won't feel relieved.. ..that's why l thought the least a rogue like me can do is apologise. You will return bruised. lt's not that simple, you ring the bell.. ..ding-dong and say sorry, madam. l know. But l have to do it. l will have to do it. The rest depends on them.. This is to announce the departure of Flight SQ 232 to Delhi. Passengers are requested to proceed to security check. That's me. You okay? Let me know if you need to bash someone up. l will. Also call or SMS me if they have a hot sister. l surely will. Bye.. 'The past is over.. there's no control over it..' 'And you will rectify the future only..' 'When you set things straight in the present..' Stop here.. How much? 40 rupees, sir. 'l had called up in her house as a credit card agent that's.. .. when l got to know that Mahi has now become Mrs. Ahluwalia.. Great! Now she also has a junior Ahluwalia! Whom do you want? Hello kiddo, is your mother at home? Dimpy! Fabulous! Ahluwalia and Ahluwalia? Dear, call your mother. Daddy! Why do kids these days don't listen? No, Goldy please don't behave like this.. Yes? Hi, is Mahi there? She's gone to her mother's house. lt is Chhoti's.. my sister-in-law's wedding. And you're? l'm Raj. Mahi's friend.. l met the Pasricha family in Switzerland. We went for a Eurail trip together. lt's has been a long time, how is she? Get used to it. lt will hurt for a few days.. ..till it doesn't turn from black to blue and then yellow. Whisky? l think you mistook me for someone else. l.. l.. think there has been a misunderstanding. You're the rogue Raj Sharma, aren't you? Rogue.. Yes. l'm Joginder Singh Ahluwalia, Mahi's husband. Where are we? Doesn't make a difference.. Be grateful that you're alive.. You.. l mean l.. will stay alive, right? Shut up and drink the whisky. Don't get scared. The brave never harm the timid. Look.. sir.. l'm not here to mess things.. You messed up 12 years ago.. and l'm paying for it. You know.. about me? Preeti told me long back.. No sir, l've.. lf l could l would have gotten hold of you and taught you a lesson.. ..but no one knew about your whereabouts.. Mahi.. Don't take her name.. Yes, brother.. l hope you weren't thinking that she must be still waiting for you.. ..pining for your love? Clear out your misunderstanding.. or l will clear it for you.. No, sir.. it's been cleared.. l had seen her 15 years ago on Lawrence road. She was enjoying snacks with Preeti. l've been in love with her since then. But she didn't even notice me. From a distance l just kept on loving her.. ..problem is that now she is my wife.. ..but l still love her from a distance. l still can't talk to her. l don't know to sweet-talk, in which rogues like you are experts. You are so lanky.. you have no muscles nor spine.. l wonder what she saw in you! l had to pay the price for whatever she saw in you. She neither believes in love, nor in romance. She neither watches movies nor listens to songs. She holds back everything inside. She just does her duty. My house is perfect, She's a perfect wife. My children are perfect. Whenever l talk about love, romance.. ..she suddenly remembers to clean the kitchen shelf. And l.. l wait for the day to see in her eyes.. ..what she couldn't see in mine. By God! You are Raj.. l think you are drunk. l am not Raj, you fool, you are Raj.. No, sir.. Raj.. the DDLJ one, Mahi's romantic hero.. ..the one she was looking for.. her perfect love.. lf l could only have 5 minutes with her.. Not even a single second.. l will kill you if you come even a kilometer close to her.. ..you have already ruined everything.. ..you don't need to mess it up further. l have been rectifying your mistake from past 12 years.. ..if you go close to her then it will take me another 12 years.. ..no need to apologise to her. Sardar practically dropped me till Delhi. But l am also a killer, l wouldn't go so easily.. Yes, l was a little scared but l will do what l came here for.. ..and as it is l have paid for 3 nights and 4 days.. so might as well..' Chocolate milk-shake, sir. Straw? Can't have it the normal way.. thanks to Mr. Ahluwalia.. Come on lets drink and celebrate Wedding party. To Karan and Piya! Piya? Pasricha's daughter? Yes, sir. Nice family. ls the groom any good? Have a look for yourself.. the one in blue shirt.. Karan Behl. Behl electrical's only son.. has two bungalows.. and l've heard they also have property in Delhi's golf link locality.. Great! 'Why bother about the market value.. l am just wondering.. ..if DDLJ had a few such ideas then.. ..that would have made things easier for me. Offer him champagne, my treat. Compliments from the gentleman at the bar. Thanks! Cheers! Pal.. you can't cheers from such a distance.. ..come here and enjoy it with me. 'lf things don't work out in the normal way.. ..then use a straw.. Mahi.. l am coming..' Closer.. closer.. Where's Mahi?! - Mahi! Coming.. please excuse me.. Sorry mom.. Hey Raj! lt's him, right? Hmm.. What is he doing here? l don't know.. didn't ask me before coming.. Didn't Karan call out to him? ls he from the groom's side? lf it's so then l am telling you Mahi, break the alliance. Don't let Chhoti marry Karan.. ..if such people are there in his family.. ..then the entire family must be bad.. Forget it. How can l forget it? lt's the question of Chhoti's life.. ..it will affect her children.. l will go and find out. No, Preeti. Patiala peg - Yes sir.. lt's Scotch.. From where did you get the guts to come here? There's something in the winds of Punjab. Don't be over smart. You will get thrashed. l am keeping quiet because the groom's family is here.. ..but if you go any closer to Mahi.. ..then everyone will return bruised and battered from here. Hello.. dad's rifle is in the jeep.. ..and l know how to shoot.. so take care, okay? Oh really! Thank you.. pleased to meet you too. l can see the Punjabis' love overflowing. You're? No.. Yes, of course.. No.. not at all.. l can't be mistaken.. ..you are the same boy who missed.. ..the train along with Mahi, aren't you? 'That's it.. another slap on the way..' Son.. l didn't get a chance to thank you properly then. You had helped her. l'm the bride's father.. l am saying it from my heart. My family shall never forget this favour of yours.. ..please.. take this to be your own house. Thank you, sir.. Let me know if you need something.. Yes, sir.. God bless you, son. Hi, Mahi. Hello. You.. Meals are being served.. please help yourself.. ..it's a buffet, Chinese, lndian and continental.. l.. - Excuse me.. Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! l don't want to wear it.. No darling Dimpy, you are looking so handsome. Uncle. - Yes son. l'll back in a minute - Please go.. 'Both of them should be Black Cat security personnels.. ..why are they wasting their life in Punjab?' Karan, where is the drum.. What are you doing? l will lose my points. Let me play or l will complain to mom.. lf you seek mummy, l will seek daddy. Daddy is also scared of mummy.. l won't give you the game.. What are you doing? Checking my games.. Which games do you have? Bio shock, project Gotham, Raining 4 and Halo 3 Halo 3? - Hmmm.. Even l want to play. Sorry, l only let my friends play. Then lets be friends. l am Dimpy. My name's Raj.. but what game do you have in exchange? ln exchange ..none goldy took that one stupid Any other game will do if you don't have a video game.. Carom board is at home.. Oh.. then l will think of something else.. Sister, how's that possible.. ..that brother-in-law is dancing and you aren't! No, Karan.. l'm sorry.. Forget it Karan, she isn't interested in these things. Mummy mummy ..Goldy's stomach is paining. ..he is in the bathroom crying.. l'll just come, Chhoti. lf you find Dr. Bhandari then don't let him go.. Yes.. Goldy. Goldy. Son.. He's in the drawing room playing video game.. l made Dimpy lie, goldy's stomach isn't aching l wanted to meet you.. l am not from the groom's side.. l do not know Karan either, l befriended him only to meet you. Sorry.. l just wanted to talk to you.. in private. We don't have anything to say to each other. Mahi.. l do.. l want to apologise to you.. Apologise? What for? For what l did.. in Europe.. Mahi, l didn't do it on purpose.. l was an idiot.. l wanted to be a killer in front of my friends.. that's why that lie.. You said so many lies.. everything was a lie. You were interested in just one thing.. You think l do not have any sense, that l am the biggest fool in.. .. the world or l am a pilgrimage.. .. a holy place where you can wash away your sins.. What do you want? That l should forgive you? l forgive you. Okay? Happy? No.. it's all wrong.. ..it was wrong that l tried to be your Raj. lt was wrong that that l made you lose faith in love. lt was wrong that you lost.. ..hope that some Raj is waiting for you. And l apologise for all that. There's no need to apologise. Whether you alive or dead.. whether you feel the hurt or not.. .. it doesn't make any difference to me. l forgot those few moments l spent with you when l got married. Ok. Ok. Maybe l deserve it. But why are you punishing Joginder? What nonsense are you talking? You have closed your heart so tightly, that neither could you see.. ..his love nor could his love reach you. He loves you like crazy.. but you didn't notice it. The love you always wanted.. Joginder is your Raj, Mahi. You have married your Raj but you can't see that. lt's none of your business.. .. of what's going on between me and my husband.. l love him.. lt's not necessary to display your emotions.. What rubbish.. love should be seen.. .. you have taught me that. Leave my hand.. you don't have any right to do so.. But Joginder does.. he has a right to leave you.. especially after knowing what happened between us and .. ..why are you like this.. Preeti told him everything. He is still waiting for you since 12 years Mahi.. Which man has so much patience.. a husband here is happy.. ..having a wife who is taking care of the house and producing babies.. Love is just restricted to the honeymoon. But your husband is not like that.. you are.. You know that both of you are not happy.. ..but you can be.. if you do something.. lt's difficult to find love, but once found can be lost easily.. Ensure that it does not go out of your life, Mahi. Hanky.. That.. kohl is a little.. Here? No.. there.. no.. give l'll.. may l do it? Okay? - Gone? Chhoti was looking for you the music ceremony is about to begin..

Dance for me. - Now? - Yes. Here ? - Yes Whatever she does, she does it best. Her speech is mesmerizing. She punishes everybody. She does.. she does.. She dances in the fair, amidst all.

That finger still has it.. do it properly.. are you blind? Raj.. Stop smiling. Remove the nail polish. You are really very desperate, aren't you.. to have my forgiveness? l mean, no matter how badly l behave.. you will endure it? Radhika, l'm sorry.. l'm really sorry. l shouldn't have done what l did with you.. l should've told you the truth that l am not ready to get married.. ..l shouldn't have stranded you at alter. But l was very scared. Hence instead of behaving maturely.. ..l ran away like a fool.. and hurt you even more. l'm sorry, there wasn't anything amiss in you, it was in me.. ..that's why l'm regretting for my actions. Bullshit! There was something amiss in me.. l wasn't that type of girl.. l was fast as l was staying with you before marriage. No one marries a girl like me.. ..no one takes a girl like me to meet his mother.. ..a girl like me.. ..and don't you dare deny it! You know that this is true. You will never know how l felt that day. You know how bad l felt.. like l'm some kind of a cheap trash, use and throw types. Because if l can stay with you, l can stay with anyone.. right? Right? No Radhika, it's not that.. l know.. You don't know anything.. how will you know? Were you there? Were you? Were you there when l was waiting for you.. ..in my wedding dress along with my friends? No. lt was my wedding day for heaven's sake! The most beautiful day of my life.. and you destroyed it forever. l've never seen a man like you.. You are the worst kind of human being possible. You don't know anything.. And now you fear that you will be heartbroken once again.. ..if someone turns out to be like me? You punish them before anyone can hurt you.. ..you have got a chance to look down upon the world.. ..and you are making use of it.. ..don't do that.. ..that will make only one person suffer.. ..stay lonely.. and that's you, Radhika. Shreya.. the name is Shreya. And l am not lonely. l am at the top. And 'the person' as you put it.. ..who stays at the top, is powerful, not lonely. lt's my life. And it's perfect. People are dying to lead Shreya Rathod's life. Soft drink companies come up with offers.. write a slogan and.. ..be with Shreya, behave like Shreya, live a day of Shreya's life. Changing your name won't change you. Just shut up.. you did what you wanted to.. Now you can't do anything to expunge it.. Go away, Raj.. This game is over. Get out of here.. and never come back.. l will never forgive you.. 'Sachin was right.. it won't be so easy as.. go and say sorry, madam.' 'Why will she forgive me.. l myself can't forgive myself..' lt's unimaginable to think how would l feel if someone had.. ..behaved in the same manner as l behaved with her. Radhika you.. No one has hurt me the way you have.. ..but no one has also worked so hard to repent for one's mistake.. l am tired.. l got into a habit of hating you.. ..a part of my life, wherever l go.. ..shooting, shows, make-up, recordings, location sets.. l'm still outside that registrar's office. l am still stuck on the date 8th August. And if l don't forgive you today, l will be stuck there forever.. There.. that felt good. So you have forgiven me? Yes. Yes, l forgive you. Thank you. Actually, l should be the one thanking you. Had you not left me.. ..l wouldn't have become such a famous star in rebound. Become Shreya from Radhika. And if you wouldn't have come back.. on your knees.. ..asking for my forgiveness. Then Shreya wouldn't have become Radhika again.. Sometimes you need a little push to recognize yourself.. lt's a different thing that you pushed a little to hard.. ..but l forgive you.. Last and final call to passengers travelling to Sydney on flight 383. Kindly proceed for boarding. All the best, Raj! l won't go like this.. lt was a pleasure to meet Radhika. Me too. Can l say something.. whoever you will love.. will be a killer.. l know. Take care of you. Shreya.. Shreya.. lsn't that Shreya? The bitch has to be back at work. Sunglasses? Check. Lip-gloss? - Check. Shreya? Radhika. Check.. it's show time. Hi guys! 'l can't believe.. l did what l wanted to do.. ..now l am feeling a little better inside and today for the first time.. ..l feel Raj Sharma isn't a bad man, after all..' How are you? - l'm Fine. You're a killer. You did what you wanted to! Come on.. hurry up.. someone is waiting for you.. Who? - Come on.. Oh my God! A power packed motley of SUV and convertible.. ..your sister and my lady.. Anna. Anna? Anna Kournikova, you remember the Russian.. ..a looker and great player.. Want to give it a shot? Of course! You have always stolen my games and played with them.. ..now it's my turn. You don't know how much courage l am gathering to write to you.. Raj.. l broke your heart, but l am the one feeling hurt. l left you then why am l missing you? To tell you about how l feel.. ..was as necessary as to breathe.. l make you a part of my day.. l write to you everyday.. ..but l don't know whether you read them or.. .. just throw them away.. ..and laugh and say she's such a fool.. Today l am at the same.. ..point where you were a year ago and.. ..it's not a very nice place.. l am sorry.. l love you, Raj. That forever kind of love.. ..the old fashioned.. long lasting forever.. Gayatri.. Gayatri! Gayatri! Shit! - Gayatri! Taxi! Sorry, l need this taxi. l got it first. l have a flight to catch. No, you don't understand.. No, you don't understand. This is my taxi. l'm in it. Adam.. get in. - Yes dad! l'm in a rush. l need to get to the airport. Now! Gayatri, tell him that this is my taxi. lf you don't step on it right now, l will take your license number .. ..down and report you. Now get moving! Right now! Hi.. Hi.. You are still drive a taxi? Yes.. is that a problem? No.. why.. what problem would l have.. the letters you wrote me.. l just saw them.. Just saw?! l have been writing them since 6 months.. 6 months.. ..and you just noticed them.. l mean.. what is wrong with you? That l.. had gone out. For 6 months? Why? Where did you go? For a vacation? l have been crying my heart out here and you.. ..have been chilling on.. ..some beach drinking Pina Coladas? l hate Pina Coladas. Don't mess with me. l know.. there is a hockey.. stick in the boot.. .. and you have learnt Taekwondo. You should have informed me that you were about to vanish.. l know.. l wonder why l didn't l call you.. ..let me think.. ah yes. Now l remember.. you left me heart-broken.. you ditched me.. Sorry, l'll call you back.. bye.. carry on. So? l said and you left.. l will speak whatever comes to my mind. Can't you apply your logic? l am a girl; l have a right to change my mind.. And it's my job to keep a track of your changing mind.. ..when will you decide in my favour.. right? Yes.. - l was doing just that. What? Remember l had told you. l'll wait.. At every stage of my life.. l'll wait Why are we stopping here? We're almost there. Just shut up.. this is important.. and you.. get out. Huh? - Out! Hey! Where are you going? lsn't it funny.. inside.. you were saying .. ..so many things in front of him and now.. Shut up.. l'm trying to think.. you know how hard it is.. l'm not into a habit of accepting my mistakes.. Should l help? lf not anything else l have at least learnt how to apologise. l know you will say you too.. ..love me as much as l do.. ..you'll say.. l have changed you.. ..can we begin all over again.. ..do l still love you.. the forever kind? lf l say that.. then what will you say? Got your answer? You still love me.. after what l did.. lt's very easy, you see, loving you is like loving myself.. ..we both are stupid, we both thought that we are killers.. we both made mistakes.. ..but we weren't perfect.. ..we are just the same.. ..that's why we're made for each other.. ..that's why.. l love you so much. 'A very killer philosopher had said that.. ..the past is over.. there is no control over it..' 'And you'll rectify the future.. ..only when you set things straight in the present.. Hello.. l had said that.. Wow.. l am a killer..'
