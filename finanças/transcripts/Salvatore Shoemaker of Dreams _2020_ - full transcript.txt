I love feet. They talk to me. As I take them in my hands, I feel their strengths, their weaknesses, their vitality or their failings. A good foot, its muscles firm, its arch strong, is a delight to touch. A masterpiece of divine workmanship. My desire to work with feet was unrelenting, and it took hold of me profoundly when I was still a small boy in a remote Southern Italian village, ninety kilometers east of Naples. You had to go to Bonito on purpose, it wasn't along the provincial road. You had to deviate from the provincial road of Irpinia to reach this small village on a hill, where time had stood still, it was an archaic world. I was born in this house in 1898, the eleventh child of fourteen. Three of my siblings died in childhood, including the first Salvatore. I inherited his name. My father Antonio and my mother Mariantonia were farmers, with joint properties each of about ten acres. Our meager income came from the proceeds of our crops: wine from the vines, wheat and corn from the fields, oil from the olives. Bonito was a cul-de-sac, a dead end. To get ahead, one had to leave. One by one, my elder brothers and sisters left for the United States, sending back their earnings to help keep up the farm, where I remained with my brother Elio, my two younger sisters, my father and my mother. Luigi Festa had his shoe shop in front of our house. I'd sneak in, perch myself on a chair, and stare at his fingers working on the shoes. That was the place I wanted to be. But in Italy, back then, the shoemaker was the lowest of all the classes. No matter how humble a family, the shoemaker was humbler still. It happened one night in the basement of his house. Two of his sisters were to take Communion and didn't have decent shoes. What's so special about this story? He knew how to make shoes. In one night he created two pair of shoes. It's not magic, it's the truth. He made those shoes. Coming from Bonito, was it? And going... I don't know if his brothers went with him to Naples? I mean, Naples in itself is another galaxy. My apprenticeship in the workshop of Luigi Festa had begun with the most menial tasks, such as straightening the used nails and taking care of his children. Before the end of the year, I had mastered every phase of the craft and could produce a complete shoe. My maestro gained fame throughout the village for having this talented young boy working for him. I was ten when my father suddenly died. Don Belmonte, the pharmacist, and Don Inglese, the teacher, began to urge me to leave Bonito. "Now it is time for you to capitalize on your ability." I went to my mother and told her what they told me. At first she objected strongly. Finally she agreed to my plea. It was arranged that I should go to Naples. It was 1909. In Naples he finds a situation that is the epitome of the Italian contradiction. He finds the upscale neighborhoods, the beautiful stores, but also the destitute neighborhoods like the one he probably lived in. We have no evidence of this, we can only make assumptions that his situation in Naples was particularly difficult. I got a job in the most fashionable shop in Naples in those days. I told the owner I wanted to learn how to cut the shoes and make models, and I wanted to learn how to take measurements in the way they were doing in Naples. "Well," he told me dubiously, "that's a long job." I started with him and in two weeks I went from nothing up to cutting the shoes, making models and doing the molding. I thought there was nothing else I had to learn. I knew it all. In 1915 the Italian cinema industry was the most important in the world. In the main cities there were many theaters where people went to watch films. Ferragamo did not stay in Naples for long, but it's likely that the movies produced there, where the film industry was quite racy compared to what was done in Turin, may have interested him. He didn't have great financial resources and couldn't afford the Teatro San Carlo and the opera, another passion of his. I had worked for a major establishment and mastered the art of shoemaking. I felt I was ready to open a shop of my own. I went to see my uncle Alessandro, the priest, and presented my idea. He thought I was foolish, but advanced me twenty liras to start. It was time to leave Naples and go home. I was twelve years old. I find it difficult to look inside the secret of shoes. Because we all know from our own experience that it can be comfortable or it can be very uncomfortable. He had the secret. You know, when you look at Marilyn Monroe's shoes, and you think of her and the way she pranced around in them, she must have been very comfortable. And that must have been his secret weapon, the fact that the shoes were something that people wanted to wear. Manolo, this movie is titled The Shoemaker of Dream. Which is exactly what happened, I was going to tell you, that I... Like in the '70s, when I came to London, I got under the arches in Notting Hill, a copy of Shoemaker of Dreams. This is the first time, actually the second time, that I just got to know something about his life and his wonderful achievements, so it was very interesting because at the time, I was starting to do shoes myself, so... Back in Bonito, I engaged two assistants: an eighteen-year-old who worked for another village shoemaker, and a boy of seven to straighten the nails. I wanted to recreate the sort of boutique I knew in Naples. but I couldn't afford to do that. So I took over a small hallway in our house between the front door and the kitchen. I placed some shoes on the table to show to the customers, and opened the door, so that everybody could see that I was doing the work myself. Villagers came by and looked in, and I became known as "Salvatore the Shoemaker," who had been to Naples to learn the trade of shoemaking, and who could make high heel shoes. Soon I was making shoes for all the signore in Bonito. My two assistants increased to six. I was the youngest of them. It was 1912. And now a message from our sponsor! Queen Quality Shoes Company. My older brother Alfonso lived in Boston and worked at the factory. When he returned to Bonito, he visited my shop with great admiration, but couldn't stop talking about Queen Quality Shoes. "We make fine shoes on machines," he said, "Thousands of pairs a day." I was not interested in mass production. It dawned on me, however, that no matter how hard I worked, I could never expect more than a modest income. If I went to America, I could learn their tricks, and perhaps improve on them. Again, I began to dream. It's not ambition, I hate this word, it's awful. I like determination, and this is what the man did have. That surprised me, actually. The huge determination of a boy from... Where? Bonito. I love that. Bonito. And... Determination was the key to his success. Early on a spring morning I said goodbye to Elio, kissed my mother and sisters, and set off for Naples. I carried a heavy suitcase with two shirts, a change of underclothing, spare socks, salami and cheese. Determined not to look provincial, I was wearing my brand-new rust-colored gabardine coat with a fur collar. And there I was with my third-class ticket. I did not know what I expected to find. My cabin was in the bowels of the ship, it was small, dirty. Men, women, and children were herded in cramped conditions that made the cabins look like stables. In my pocket I had my entire savings, the 100 lire required by American law for immigrants. We knew what everybody else knew about his trip to the United States, but he didn't go into much detail, not that I remember. He spoke of the courage, he talked about it to teach us to have courage in life, to be very determined to conquer what you want. This was one of his basic principles. I remember he often told us that if there was something we had undertaken, that we had started doing, or wanted to do, and we'd found obstacles or encountered difficulties, we should never, never leave it unfinished, but go all the way first and then decide if we wanted to continue or not. But never "to give up," as the Americans say. The Stampalia nosed her way into New York Harbor on a March morning in 1915. I was a boy approaching a strange country alone, with no knowledge of the language. I looked at the tall buildings and wanted desperately to climb to their roofs. I don't recall feeling any sense of loss. I felt at home in America even before my feet touched soil. In a sense, it must have been an act of freedom, a chance of even... Like Bob Dylan says, "You don't find yourself, you create yourself." There's no finding yourself. You create, and then you recreate. And this was the place, still is the place, in a sense, to create yourself, and that's what he would have found himself doing. To prepare to pass through the immigration barrier, I wrapped a dollar bill around some scraps of paper and tied the bundle with an elastic band. When the officials asked me if I had the twenty dollars, I showed them the roll, they nodded and told me I could go through. There are many different facets to this country, and it's all being created. It's not set. It still isn't set. It's still being created. We're having our greatest test right now since the Civil War. Six days and six nights. I stared out the windows, fascinated by the vastness of the land. In Bonito, I had thought my parents' property large. Here, I realized that it was only a postage stamp. In America he believed he'd find the ability to make shoes with a different care, but he also probably imagined he'd find a faster, more dynamic world in which he could try things out and show what he's worth. That's why he didn't stay in Boston, I think. In Boston he would have been a factory worker in one of the many chains of some important factory maybe, but he decided to go to the other side instead. The Queen Quality Shoe Manufacturing Company was exactly as my brother Alfonso had described it. Everything I could do, the machines did in the twinkling of an eye. But I was not impressed, I was appalled. I stood dazed, watching thousands of shoes on the endless belts. They were heavy, clumsy, and brutal, and far below the standard I had set for myself. That was not shoemaking. That was no place for me. Salvatore, today it's our wedding anniversary, and you are and will always be by my side. Since you left us, my life has been intense and very active, trying to make your dreams come true. I must say that only now am I taking some time off, thanks to the valuable contribution our children give to the company. I can pause to look at what has been done, and I'm here to tell you about the events, joys, anxieties of all these years. It was you who laid the groundwork in the education of our children. The task has been easier for me. I was in a transcontinental railroad car heading west through a fabulous countryside, the youngest on the train. I was seventeen years old. As the train ran through the vastness of this unknown land, I didn't feel sad, or alone. I just felt free. My heart full of hope and dreams. And then he gets to California. Santa Barbara first. The dream was always of California. It was like the promised land for those coming from all over the world. You couldn't get further west. That's it. And so California... anything goes. You can make yourself over three times, four times, it doesn't matter. The earth was beautiful. My grandfather, my mother's father, always wanted to go to California because he could grow things in the earth. He made it as far as Staten Island, with a little garden. Although I was the youngest of the family, in Santa Barbara my brothers let me do whatever I wanted. A new world was opening up before my eyes. It was a good life. And with the First World War raging across Europe, there was no chance to return home, even if I wanted to. I moved into our new family nest, half a world away from our mother. I think primarily Ferragamo moved here because his brother was working here, and so he had that family connection. They stayed because, you know, they had a successful tailoring shop. And also they were getting that Flying A Studio business, making clothes, shoes, repairing shoes, etc. For a time, one of the largest movie studios, believe it or not, in the country, was the Flying A Studio, which came to Santa Barbara in 1912. It closed its doors in 1920. But especially in the early period, the first years, as I said, it was one of the largest-- It was sort of Hollywood before Hollywood. The world of cinema was being created, but nobody knew that. There was a demand for moving pictures, whether they were one reel or two reels. This is right around the time Griffith did Birth of a Nation, a long film, it was right after Cabiria, which was the grand epic, which once it was released and shown in theaters, there was less need for short films. This is the idea, "Go for features," right? So here's this place in California, the great thing about California? The weather. Okay. When there's no earthquake, when there's no fire, when there's no flood, no mudslides, other than that, it's really great. We have no idea how many films Ferragamo might have contributed to. He wasn't credited at the time. And I don't believe documentation exists of listing every time that he made shoes for a production, also when those shoes were reused, when the costumes were reused, when the set designs were reused, which would have happened all the time, particularly as a studio, you're recycling as a way of saving money. I love Ferragamo shoes. I have a pair of his embroidered boots that he made in the '60s, and then I bought reproductions of them. They're just gorgeous, they have Chinese satin on them. He was such an inventor! Ferragamo invented so many different kinds of platforms, fabulous platform shoes. I mean, he was a huge innovator, he knew everything about the foot. Perceived wisdom is that the people that were making films were not looking to market their stars, because it shifted the power balance very quickly. At the same time, not coincidentally, and again because you have the studios using the same actors all the time, people started to recognize players. Sort of before that, they were a little more anonymous, it would just be some players, and audiences started to want to see certain people: "Oh, who's that girl, who's this person?" But then slowly very quickly, it becomes clear that it's a wonderful marketing tool. They became royalty, they became world-famous. Anywhere they went in the world, they could be recognized. So the big stars, no matter how humble their origins, became, in a society without royalty and without that kind of privileged class, they became the top famous people. When you talk of these people, of these artists, it's like a pantheon of Greek gods and goddesses, you know, and so I think they became this phenomenon which completely overtook a mass audience to the point of, kind of hysteria in a way. The silent era has probably the best era for female actresses. I think when you think now of the silent era, you probably think more of women than men stars, but you had Mary Pickford, you had Clara Bow, you had Lillian Gish, you had Mae Marsh. All Ferragamo clients, by the way. Okay, fair enough. "The West would have been conquered earlier if they had boots like these!" This is what director Cecil B. De Mille said about my boots for Westerns. The work was hard, but I didn't care. I helped my brothers at the repair shop, crafted custom-made shoes for my actor friends, and made shoes for films. A dream come true. The requests for made-to-order shoes had become quite numerous, but despite taking measurements using the traditional method, sometimes the shoes fit, sometimes they did not. How could that be? I concluded that there was something wrong with the method itself. So I enrolled as an evening student at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, a hundred miles away from Santa Barbara, to learn human anatomy. I asked all sorts of questions. Finally one night the professor asked me, "Why, Mr. Ferragamo, are you so interested in the skeleton?" "I am a shoemaker," I answered, "and I'm interested in the feet." Talking to him broadened my mind. He lent me books on the anatomy of the skeleton, and I studied feet. And finally I acquired the knowledge that I was looking for: The relationship between the human body and its feet. The peculiar art of footwear also required solid scientific principles. "I found out that the weight of the body in an upright position falls vertically over the arch of the foot, as shown by the plumb line," stated Salvatore Ferragamo, then adding: "Hence I studied my forms giving maximum support to the arch to restore the foot's natural balance." Balance is fundamental in many things. But he made his first study on balance when he wanted to prove that the weight of a standing person fell on the arch of the foot, and therefore he wanted to produce his shoes, his footwear, following this principle. And I believe that this balance, eventually, was conceived and applied in so many things he did. It's a grace to have balance. And he did a whole study on the American fit, not only based on the length of the foot but on its shape, its width, since a country like the United States has so many different ethnic groups. Hence, also different physical structures. Anglo-Saxons usually have a very thin foot while Asians have a wider foot. In theory, you'd need six fits, six different widths for the same length. This was the most important key to his success. Comfort combined with creativity, the aesthetic part. The great thing about Salvatore Ferragamo was that he was a craftsman more than anything else, even with all these famous people that put his shoes on, with all that side of it, what he really was at the beginning was somebody who understood the craft of making a shoe. I think probably what Ferragamo realized is that yes, there's more and more that's happening there, and it probably was a good place for him to go to try to get in early on a lot of what was happening in the film industry. His accident would have had a very profound effect on him, not just because it was the death of his brother, but also he would have been in hospital for a very long time, really thinking about it. I think the injury would have been very painful, he would have wanted to try and find a way to mitigate that pain. He has a very bad leg break, probably one or even both of the long bones in his legs. So the bone in his thigh and the bone in his lower leg. It may have been that the doctors who treated him weren't very experienced in dealing with this injury, it may have been that they wanted to amputate the leg. There was a tendency at this point to say: "Oh, it's okay, we'll take the leg off for you." Our Santa Barbara friend, Dr. Rexwald Brown, stepped in and took over my case. He prescribed an ancient treatment of pulling the leg for as long as the patient could stand the pain, and then relaxing the pressure. Traction, essentially. It was excruciating. But there was a great deal of risk that his leg would shorten as the bones healed, so he needed to make sure that the legs stayed the same length. From my bed, I devised a new type of splint. A long cylinder into which the leg was inserted. The top pushed against the pelvic joints, and the limb was pulled by a device at the foot end, which could be tightened or loosened as required. Once fixed, it would maintain the pressure. My splint lessened the pain considerably and improved treatment efficiency. I think what's really interesting about this is that it has the foot section. He's thinking about the leg, but he's also thinking about the foot and the elaborateness of the section that he's invented means that he is thinking about this in a very complete way. He understands the relationship between the leg and the foot. And as he lay there in bed wearing an uncomfortable splint, understanding probably better than his doctors it wasn't working properly, he has plenty of time to come up with an alternative. It's beautifully made, and the shoemaker in him can't resist tweaking and fiddling, and he must at some point realized that existing technology couldn't be adapted. What was going to be needed was a completely new model. My father was very creative and also very ingenious, so when he created something very special, he got a patent for it. They were mainly related to footwear, the most important I remember dealt with unusual heels or constructions, the famous cage heel, made of small metal wires, but they make a solid structure all together. Ferragamo was a patent maniac, and patents are part of the American Dream. They incorporate the idea that everyone can use the same systems and get to be known for what your own mind or imagination is able to create. Therefore, Ferragamo, relentlessly, filed patents by the thousands of all kinds, shoes, the fit of the shoes, the metallic arch inside the heel. Not forgetting his disquisitions on non-footwear subjects too. I am very fond of the patent regarding a "Military Fort for Space Defense," so that no missile could hit an earthly target, very interesting for those years. He really looked to the future because in the ancient Italian tradition, there were no patents, everything was of the people, everything was shared. The patent is the idea of innovating, while bringing American modernity within the Italic features from the Neo-Renaissance onwards. The Hollywood to which I came, in the spring of 1923, was no more than a village in the sun. There was a scattering of palatial homes. My own was just below the Hollywoodland sign, not far from Charlie Chaplin's. The Hollywoodland sign was put up in the 1920s as an advertisement for people to come and build houses and live in what's now the Beachwood Canyon area, right under the Hollywood sign. It remained Hollywoodland up on the side of the mountain until the late 1940s and then they took it down, the "land," the last four letters were taken down so it would just say Hollywood, but for many years it was called Hollywoodland. It was small. It was a village, there were orange groves, but it was not a giant metropolis and the Hollywood actors and sort of the film industry moved there, or ended up congealing there, obviously changed the complete face of the place. In 1910 in Los Angeles there were only 320,000 people. If you compare that to, in Europe, Rome or London or Paris, or New York for that matter, it was nothing, absolutely this small, little place. People forget there was no radio until the early '20s, there was theater, but not everybody could afford theater. My parents, my grandparents, they couldn't go to theater, you know? So, you have cinema, you have the movies, you have... And what a way to be able to create a fashion, so to speak, with people seeing it on the screen. And then the idea of the movie palaces took over and it was a place of luxury and a place of great entertainment that average people didn't have access to and something that everyone could partake in, and it was like an escape into this other marvelous world, and so clearly the appeal of it was enormous, and that's why the business grew as quickly as it did, and the glamour of it too. I quickly found exactly the retail space I wanted for my business: a two-story footwear boutique at the corner of Hollywood and Las Palmas Boulevards, known as the Hollywood Boot Shop. I filled the interior with a series of colonnades designed to shut off the fitting place from the main entrance space, and to ensure an atmosphere of privacy and discretion. I opened the shop with a flourish. The stars sent goodwill messages and huge bunches of flowers, and many came in person, including Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, Pola Negri, and Monty Banks. My life had taken another track. When the cinema industry moved to Hollywood, my father didn't hesitate. He went there and opened his first real store in 1923. Your husband's customers were very important people. Yes, they were. Any fun fact, for example, any unusual event? He used to tell many really strange and amusing stories about the time he spent in Hollywood. For example, people like Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, had actually become his friends, and sometimes they went to get him out of bed to have some spaghetti together. Many odd things, yes... I'm getting emotional, so... Barrymore used to drop into my shop for a drink, as well as to buy shoes. It was the time of Prohibition, and while stars could get most anything they wanted, I always kept a bottle of something tucked away in the back of the salon for such occasions. I became known as a mixer of splendid drinks and was asked to parties more as a barman than as a guest. While everyone was drinking my concoctions, I stood behind the bar with a glass of what looked like whiskey, but was in fact ginger ale. Hollywood was a very social place, there are parties all the time. You have to remember you've got these people who are suddenly earning a huge amount of money, people who had struggled before, maybe were earning nothing in vaudeville or nothing on stage, and suddenly they're stars. So of course you're going to splurge, you're gonna spend a lot of money, you're gonna buy a big house, you want a pool. You're in California, you need a pool. What happened, how did cinema and how did Valentino and Ferragamo, all of that come together to create such a phenomenon? He was a beautiful boy, debonair and perfectly groomed, with every hair slicked down, every movement and every gesture thoughtfully measured. He would drop by my house on Beachwood Drive and eat a bowl of spaghetti, and we'd speak in Italian. For him, I made white nubuck and black calfskin Oxford shoes. His command on the screen was extraordinary. We do remember the shoes. He was an extraordinary figure that tapped into the mass psychosis, so to speak, an emotional response. Look at what happened at the funeral. An emotional response the country had never seen before, really. You may have had big funerals for political figures and that sort of thing, but not like this. The merits of my work had spread, and most of the studios asked me to make shoes for them: Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Warner Brothers, Universal Studios. One of the biggest genres, and you certainly know this from Italian films, are the Biblical and historical epics, because you could show something that no stage could ever contain, with these enormous sets of ancient Babylon, and ancient Rome and so on. The Ten Commandments was my first commission for a shoe wardrobe of a spectacle film of such immensity. I had never designed shoes for the Babylonian-Egyptian-Hebraic period, and my knowledge of the times was nil. I sat down to work and the inspiration came. I took the results to DeMille. He was delighted and enthusiastic, and I had no corrections to make. I also worked for D.W. Griffith. By then, The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance were already behind him, and there were many more films to come, including The White Rose and Way Down East, for which I did the shoes for Lillian Gish. He worked very closely with the costume designer and designed a shoe to fit the costume and the character. I mean, more than to fit, but to match and to enhance. D.W. Griffith was fond of pretty feet, and pretty legs and ankles as well. So he suggested that we hold a beauty competition for the best feet, ankles, and legs in Hollywood. He would offer the first prize, a six-month film contract, and I could give second and third prizes, which were shoes. The winner was Marjorie Howard. My choice was a girl with beautiful legs who was trying hard to break into films. Her name was Joan Crawford. What would you like me to do with this beautiful thing? I think it's my size! The Thief of Bagdad, with Douglas Fairbanks, was enormously successful, one of the biggest hits of the '20s. There was a lot of room for liberty in the kind of things that any designer could come up with on a film like that. You know, the more flashy and outrageous, the better, probably. This shoe is so much more beautiful than it needed to be. I love holding it, I love touching it. It is so completely sensual. Look how it's made! Unless you had a close-up or an insert of this shoe, you would never see how magnificently constructed it is. And can you imagine Douglas Fairbanks wearing it? I mean, he was the king of Hollywood at the time. Aren't these the shoes for a king? I had immense respect for my Hollywood customers. Great actors and actresses, whether on stage or screen, always give of themselves, drawing upon their exceptional depths of emotion and sensation to convey everything to their audiences. I had the privilege of seeing some of them in front of the cameras too. Pola Negri was so intense, I feared she would not live through the performance! I didn't realize then, but I would carry on making shoes for them throughout my career. So in California, he was very lucky to meet all those-- Can you imagine? All those movie queens like, I mean... Pola Negri, you know, Marion Davies, and he did shoes for many of those women, I don't even know which ones, but... Gloria Swanson included, so... You know, I'm mad about silent movies. In fact, I prefer silent movies over anything else. Sadie Thompson, it's about a really bad girl. So these were supposed to be really-bad-girl shoes. Gloria Swanson was a tiny, tiny little person with a very big face and a very long career, and she was a very strong person. And I'm sure that she controlled her image. It became an iconic character, and whenever you think of it, you think of Gloria Swanson in that version because of the audacious nature of the footwear, really. This is a tragic role, a role of a woman who wants out. Well, she was a streetwalker, and that's why this bow is a little bit too big, and that's why these heels are a little too high, because this would have affected how she walked, and you would have seen these bows if she crossed her legs. So this is a very deliberate style. Plus... You know what the ankle strap was called? -No. -No. Well, I can't say it on film. -No, please. -You can. You have to! Gloria Swanson was playing Sadie Thompson in a black-and-white movie. That's another reason why this bow is so important, because in any black-and-white movie you just have shades of gray, and everything is about reflection. See the reflection on the shoe? It's gonna catch the light. And contrast. You will definitely see this bow pop in the movie, so it will attract attention to her legs and to her ankles. Along with this exceptional imagination, this sense of shoe fashion, that was generally still very poor at that time, he wanted to create a product that had something special in it, that would have a perfect fit, something, let's say, bigger than a normal product. So he returned to Italy, looking for this excellent manpower that he knew he would find, and he chose to go to Florence. He chose Florence for various reasons, for its craftsmanship, and because he liked the city very much, he was greatly attracted to this small, neat, refined city. The strength to leave a success he never would have dreamed of to follow the dream of "Made in Italy," which he pioneered. Salvatore Ferragamo, as soon as he arrived in Florence with his movie camera, a real jewel for that time, filmed the center of Florence. He filmed Lungarno, the Uffizi, Ponte alle Grazie with its small chapels still intact before the bombing. He then turned his camera around, filming his sisters wearing beautiful straw hats, then the hills in an almost prophetic way because he filmed the hills right in the spot where he will later buy his villa. Florence is the city that he chose. He chose Florence and the Tuscan territory for its great traditions of culture, of craftsmanship, for the opportunities he had to develop his work to the fullest. Coming back from the United States, he knew exactly what he wanted. The United States had been a springboard for him, an extraordinary school of life, but they could not offer him that extra something we have in Italy: the artisan labor force that is part of our cultural traditions. So he decided to return to Italy, he thought a lot about it, he told us about this so many times, and he chose Florence for this very reason. Once he got here, it was Florence that conquered him. In 1927, when Ferragamo returned to Italy, the Fascist regime was quite well established but not yet totally in control of all the aspects. The Italian 1920s are much more nuanced and controversial compared to the 1930s when the regime became a total one. There is a whole mechanism that makes Florence the place where foreigners are invited to visit fashion stores. Couture at that time was based in Paris. Italy was limited to tailoring, but it was very good at accessories. When he arrived in Florence he understood that the art matrix, which is the distinctive basic element of the city, could become, together with the technology learned in America, a springboard towards shoe production with a functional material that would not only be comfortable, it would also combine beauty. Beauty meant as knowledge of the materials. The plan was simple. I would make shoes here and sell them in America, to former as well as new customers. I went to see various artisans all over the city and told them my idea. For my new workshop, I insisted upon certain processes. Some of the boys were natural shoemakers, some less so, but all were keen to learn. I organized them in sections, teaching each one a specific task. It was like a manufacturing line but with craftsmen. It worked. In a short time, I had eighteen single shoes, each quite different from the other. I was full of hope and the certainty of success. I had something to take back to America, something entirely new. After he returned to Italy and settled in Florence after 1927, he went to America to present to the buyers these 18 shoe models he had made with... Great passion, putting together a team of artisans and shoemakers. Grandfather describes how he had put these shoes on brown velvet and the love with which he had arranged his "creatures." But when this Mr. Miller arrived, he looked at them in silence and didn't even touch them, which struck my grandfather very much. Grandfather said he felt he was suffocating, he almost fainted, then he remained alone in the room with his shoes, and there's something that moved me so much because he said it was as if the shoes were talking to him, and they said... "Salvatore, it's not true, keep working, don't stop. There's something here." He thought he was going crazy. "Shoes can't be talking to me," he said. He believed in what he had done, he didn't lose heart and called another buyer, then the story continued. I called Manuel Gerton, the buyer for Saks Fifth Avenue, who came right away. He was overwhelmed. His eyes brightened. "These shoes are marvelous," he said, "I want them all." We'll tell you a beautiful fairy tale: "The Ferragamo Family." A beautiful fairy tale, an Italian fairy tale. Not wanting to give in to the temptation of the assembly line, so to speak, he returned to Florence, his adoptive town, where he created a model factory with workers, his colleagues, and they produced shoes, but he had no luck and went bankrupt, is that true? Yes, he had great financial difficulties. As a consequence of the Great Depression of 1929. The Great Depression of 1929 deeply affected Ferragamo's business. At that time, he didn't make shoes for the Italian market, he had no Italian or European customers, he only had American customers. At that time, when he moved from America to Italy and until the end of WWII, he had... eighteen years of great satisfaction but also of incredible difficulties. So much so that in 1933, he declared bankruptcy and closed down his company. So the Ferragamo Company shut down in 1933. My factory was closed, and a great seal lay upon the door, forbidding entrance. My eyes filled with tears. At this place, we had done beautiful work, beautiful shoes. A few of the younger workers whom I had trained stood on the sidewalk. "Please, don't cry," they said. "Can't you take us somewhere where we can start work again?" It was absurd to consider that I could do anything for them, or much for myself. And then I thought, "But is it absurd? Was it perhaps possible if...?" I was not destitute. I had my hands and my brain. I had these work people faithful to me. And I could make shoes again, if only I could raise a little money and a few orders. Inspired by the same values that led me to leave Bonito and aim for America, I decided to start all over again. Working secretly after bankruptcy, he managed in a couple of years to pay off his debts, and start up his business again. With some young workers at his side, he moves his workshop to another location. He starts knocking at the doors of all the customers who had courted him since his arrival in Italy. He starts again in Florence, determined to make his plan work. Ferragamo understood the importance of having a place that reflected his clientele, an evocative environment. That's why, despite bankruptcy, he made the choice to rent some rooms in the most important building in the city, Palazzo Spini Feroni. ...Palazzo Feroni, and turned the 700-year-old palace... Palazzo Feroni Spini... Palazzo Spini Feroni is a former town hall. At the edge of the Roman center, inside the walls, in a strategic position. It's situated on an important road axis arriving from Rome. It was on the Arno River, on a corner which enabled it to dominate the old city since it was on its edges. Relatively speaking, it was not in the open country either, but there clearly wasn't the urban fabric we have now. He understands that the Palazzo is a place that perfectly contains all the elements that the Anglo-Americans had formulated and projected on the city. He understood that this could become an evocative place for his career and his business. And it's among the beautiful frescoes of Palazzo Feroni that Fulvia designs the new patterns of her foulards. He was already a tenant of the shop, and the owner of the property was convinced he would never be able to buy it because of his recent bankruptcy, he already had other debts to pay, it was clearly a very risky purchase. He therefore wrote up a tying contract to be paid in installments, so if he didn't pay the last installment, he'd lose all his money and the building. It would be crazy today. If you look at the numbers of that time, the cost of the building and the financial situation he was in, it probably was a crazy thing, but he was so convinced of his abilities. -But not that crazy. -No, because he succeeded. I enjoyed going to the lounge next to where we are now, with the wooden crates, everything was shipped by boat, we are talking about the years 1955-1956-1958. It was fascinating to see what happened, because in the next room shoemakers worked with a music of hammers that resounded on the wooden molds resting on the worker's knee. The symbolism in the shoe is that of metamorphosis. When you lose a shoe, a prince will follow you, he will slip it on your foot and you will become a princess. So the person who makes it, the shoemaker, has a magical power, and in all ancient cultures, for example, in the Hindu world and the Buddhist world, the shoemaker is the quintessential philosopher, because he lives alone, he's at his desk, he has extremely complex thoughts. It's no coincidence that there's a long genealogy of mystical shoemakers. That's why we say the shoe has its own magic and mystical potential that is recognized by all cultures. With certain shoes you can be invisible, with certain shoes you can fly. With what shoes can give you, you can become what fashion allows us to be, that is, another person other than ourselves. It is certainly one of the elements that better describes us. The shoe has a very long history linked to our imagination. A shoe is the starting point. Some people in the morning put on their shoes first, then get dressed. I would say that his style refers to a typical Italian approach, to Italian art, to the colors of Italian art. Often when I look at Ferragamo's creations, I think of Harlequin, of Commedia dell'Arte, I think of the futurists. When you think about the creativity of that historic moment, it was something unique to Italy through the 1930s, the 1940s, and then the 1950s, right after WWII. This idea of creating products that are at the same time unique and somehow mass-produced. They are handmade, but they can be reproduced in industrial quantities. It's almost a contradiction to think of how each of these shoes fits a foot so personally, and also expresses a point of view on fashion and the world. I have a complicated relationship with the concept of "invention." I'm not interested in the subject of Ferragamo as a great inventor. What interests me about his innovation is the time in which he did those things. It was during the war, and he succeeded in using the means available. His greatest invention was to succeed in being "streetwise." All the most difficult things were invented in a difficult moment, this is also true for Ferragamo. In early 1936, my business was in full bloom again, like it had been during my youth in America. Though it was not the happiest time in Italy. Mussolini's regime had turned darker and more menacing. In response to the iniquitous sanctions aimed at depriving Italy of raw materials indispensable for its legitimate expansion of East Africa, the population as a whole, with plebiscitary impetus, offers metals to the unfairly boycotted homeland. Even with a scrap of iron, we can forge a bayonet and a plow. Of course, the 1930s are creative years because in the difficulty caused to Italy by the economic sanctions after 1935, the outbreak of war and the difficulties in finding the usual materials for shoemaking, he was stimulated to create models with absolutely exceptional materials. It was probably easier for him than for others since he had worked in movies and was used to experimenting. To pass from tradition to modernity in a second. The whole fashion production cycle had to be Italian, from the product a dress or an accessory was made out of, to the creation of the model. So it had to be of Italian design and made with Italian materials. And he's the one who invents the famous wedge heel. His style in that period reaches its full potential and shows how in case of need... the truly creative person finds important answers. -Here we have shoes made of... -This is raffia. The materials he used are many indeed. Both for reasons of creativity, for some rather unusual models and also, of course, during the war, the lack of leather, of important materials, led him to use everything, even paper. The cork in the wedge, his most famous invention, is tree bark that makes these shoes very light. And here he worked on the idea of using wine corks to make this heel, that he would leave like this, without any covering, or cover with leather. He was so sure of the beauty of his model that he didn't even want to hide the materials he had worked with. Their craftsmanship was closer to art than shoemaking. This is not possible nowadays, everything is semi-industrialized. There are very few shoemakers capable of making shoes, if any. People work in chains now. And it's not the same. Not like there in the manufacturing. If I like something about him, it's he was there all the time, controlling and seeing the work. The structure is the most complex part of shoemaking. He opened new paths, created new elements from a structural point of view. Ferragamo created this metal layer, which was made of steel, to support the arch of the foot without causing a burdening of the shoe. The shank is always inside the shoe sole. With the shank you give robustness to the arcuate part of the plantar arch, to give stability to the arch. Without the shank, this part would lose its curve. I love these particularly. They sort of articulate, which is incredible. I've never seen a shoe that does that before. They're so flattering to the feet and creative at the same time, which I think is difficult, you know. A lot of times you get very high heels or something and the balance is all wrong and off. You see on the runway, girls fall over and... Of course! This is fabulous! Tons of people have copied this man in that respect. Millions. This is the invention, what I'm talking about, invention, something that has never been done before. So that is exactly what I think about what he's done, marvelously. "Innovation" means to push your boundaries, it is a battle against decadence. It's a form of creation with a challenge. To go beyond the sure things, what you accomplished, what you're satisfied with, and keep trying to push yourself. He created a name for Italy, in those years, before the wonderful Italian movement. Florence was the capital of fashion. Although I never met my grandfather, I sometimes feel I did know him because he's always been very present and his memory was kept alive by my grandmother, my dad and my uncles... who have always passed on so many stories about him. Perhaps I heard the story many times from my grandmother about when she saw him arrive in Bonito. -Our first encounter? -Yes. Of course I remember it! And I also wanted to "show off," you know? When I saw him, because I knew he was famous, that he used to see the actresses, he welcomed the actresses, I knew... In a small village, people talk. Also because he was from that village, so people were interested in what he did. He went to see the mayor, my grandmother was the mayor's daughter, she was nineteen, very young. My father was in his office upstairs, I knew he was coming, so I went downstairs... I went downstairs and I met him, then I did my talking because I was pretty smart, though not "that" smart, I said: "You are the famous shoemaker. Thank you for the great contribution you give to feminine elegance." -These were the words... -You had prepared them. Yes, in my mind. These were the exact words. Family played a fundamental role in all of Salvatore's story. It was a central element in all the choices he made and at all stages of his life. In all relevant family moments he was there, and when he was there, he was also eager to tell us what his work was like. Living outside Florence, we often needed to be accompanied to courses we had in other parts of town so we also had to wait for a ride to get back home. We often stopped at Palazzo Feroni, my father's office, waiting for him to take us home. I sometimes speak in the plural because I shared almost all my childhood with my sister Fiamma, the eldest. I sat in his office and as it was the end of the working day, maybe around 5:30 pm, or 6:00 pm, that was the moment when my father dedicated himself to creating new models. It was a really fascinating moment and despite being a little child, sometimes a little eager, as children tend to be at that age, to do other things or run around, I was really fascinated to see how this man was absorbed and focused on his creations. He involved me in his work and as a memory of this moment, there is a piece of leather with some seams, with a little imagination it might look like a little shoe, and underneath it says "Leonardo 1959" in my father's handwriting. This was my father, his ability to involve and drag even a child into what he did. Christian Dior wrote in his memoirs: "We came from a period in which women wore clothes as though they were soldiers, whereas I imagined them as flowers." His first fashion show, with which he won the Neiman Marcus Award, was in fact called "Corolle." -This was made for Judy Garland. -And the invisible shoes. Invisible. It's fantastic. It was designed in 1947. Not that there's anything to show on television, but it is-- There is a shoe underneath, as you realize. You'd just be seeing the sole and the heel. Right. It's lovely when it's on because you have a, you know, complete nude look on your feet. It's made of nylon thread. He saw one of his workers fishing close to Palazzo Feroni, with this new, transparent thread. That is a really beautiful shape. But, you know, this is an artist who drew this. There's the curve at the back, there's the curve at the front. I don't see a straight line in the whole shoe. And I think there are many women in the world who would like the idea that they are not being constricted by their shoes. The "Invisible Shoe": an invisible weaving of nylon threads on an "F-shaped" wedge. This creation in 1947 triumphantly wins the "Oscar of Fashion," the highest American prize. Christian Dior won this prize in 1947 for his "New Look." Ferragamo won the same prize that year for his "Invisible Shoe." This prize was very important in those days, right? Absolutely! For Mr. Dior, it happened to be very important. You have to consider that he won it with his first collection. Neiman Marcus was a very important department store in Dallas, the symbol of a luxury store in the United States. He had a wonderful time in Dallas, magnificent days. Here, at an official dinner, we can see Mr. Dior from behind, and we can see Mr. Ferragamo. Mr. Ferragamo, in his biography, says that on the ship, during the ocean crossing, he showed his shoes to Mr. Dior, who had asked to see them, and Mr. Dior was very surprised to discover that a lot of the shoes resembled in every way the clothes he had created for that occasion. On one side there were shoes... made of satin that evoked the lower part of the dress, a long satin strip on one of Mr. Dior's dresses. So there were many similarities between the two creations, and they were both very surprised because they had just created them. Mr. Dior and Mr. Ferragamo had a common trait, they were both strategists, they shared an international, world vision of their business, the creation of boutiques, they were both visionaries, within their areas. My father worked as though he had an atelier. He had a customer in front of him, and for that customer he designed a shoe according to the personality of that person. Rather than making a custom-made shoe, it was a tailor-made model. I looked more at the beautiful ladies, even though I was very young, and I couldn't believe my eyes because I came here and saw ladies... who were very well known in movies and when I told my friends at school, they didn't believe me, also because in school I wasn't considered a very brilliant student. My father explained how he wanted the customer to feel and said that every customer had to feel like a princess when they entered the shop, and every princess like a queen. It came quite... Quite unexpected. He was looking very tired, and lacking in strength, and my mother was a little alarmed, so they started seeing doctors. At the time there were few means of prevention or early diagnosis, everything was a bit unclear, so to speak. I don't know if it was sixth sense, he was a man who looked far ahead compared to the moment he lived in... I don't know if he suspected anything, but he had already asked my sister Fiamma to support him in his work. Fiamma had been working with him for a year and a half, right in his office, around the collections, the creations, and all this part of promoting collections. She was the person at home, among all of us, who had more... Who was more familiar with his work. My mother said that on the day of the funeral... she didn't really know what she would do the following day. It was August, the factories were closed and would reopen in September, and in this uncertainty, after the funeral, some of the workers loyal to my father approached her, shook her hand and said: "Mrs. Ferragamo, you must continue, we will help you." Unfortunately, those are our last memories because he was alert right until the end, so he always had a few words and some messages to give that stuck in our minds, especially at my age, we were very young. Fiamma and I were extremely worried about our mother, because she was experiencing... A sad moment, and a very difficult future loomed ahead, because my father loved her and she loved him. They had a wonderful relationship, which we were all well aware of because they showed it at all times, every day, and she was a lot younger than him, and knowing that she would be alone worried us a great deal, especially Fiamma and myself, we were the "mature ones," so to speak. Family is such a beautiful thing... Such a beautiful thing.
