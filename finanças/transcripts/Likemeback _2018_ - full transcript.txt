With tuna. With tuna. With tuna. Skinny dipping time. It's amazing! - Again? - Come on! Fabulous! - Come on in, Carla! - I'll deejay from here. - Come on. - No. Idiot. Take me on a piggy-back ride! - Sorry. - Carla, stop. You're a genius, you don't need to study for your uni entrance test! The flight was crazy, also because I had one of my usual panic attacks. Solta is one of the least known islands in Central Dalmatia. Perfect for families and relaxing. - Selena's fantastic, guys. - Ariana's much better. - She's had plastic surgery. - What are you saying? I'd have chosen a week in Ibiza, but you know my mother. I would pay to have a mother like yours. Okay, I propose a toast to this present she's given us. To the end of high school! We're free at last! Josko, listen. Photo of the day... - Try again. - Come on Lavinia, help me. Hi. What's up? We said we'd film everyone and everything. Where do you want the photo? What do you reckon? Cute. I don't know, I think he wears a ring. - Come on, Carla. - Okay. I might lose signal for a while. Chat later. I find him sexy. He could have a big one. Think so? You can't tell from here. Try touching him and you'll see. It wouldn't take that much. You get more and more stupid. She always has been. Sad. Sluts. Ugly. Cute. What do you say? We look like your assistants. As always. - Precisely, it's my profile. - God, not even drinking helps you. - I won't tag you if you don't want me to. - Whatever. Anyway, I have some really compromising videos. If he ruins your holiday, I'll send my friends from Formia. He's just a bit jealous but he makes me happy. He's brainwashed you because he's older than you. I want to relax now, thanks. - Hey. - Hi, baby girl. - How was the trip? - Fine. Did they give you the usual boat? No, it's a little older than last year's one. But really cool. That's the first time they've done that. How's the skipper? He seems okay. - All good with the girls? - Yes, they're happy. Here she is. - Hi, Silvia. - Hi, Charlie. They said to say a huge thank you. - Are they happy with the itinerary? - Yes, really happy. - But you must be baking hot... - It's unbearable. Let me know if you need anything... Of course. Be careful, okay? Yes, okay. - Dad says hi. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Where are the seasickness pills? Here. Wait five hours before taking another. I know, but I can't. I dropped my phone in the sea. Fuck, I dropped my phone in the sea! We start with thrilling experiences. Follow us on our adventure. This place is dead. - You never listen to me. - They probably sell fake phones. - Such an optimist. - I'm objective. Top of the class. Because she was forced to. - Otherwise she would've become a junkie. - Nice. Today's video got 30 likes, girls! 30 likes. - Come on, Dani, we have to go. - Photo. There she is. That's right, passionate. Like that, passionate. - A little more Gigi, please. - That's right. And now Belen. Go Belen! Go Belen! She looks more like a porn star. There she goes! That's great! Go, girl Do you like it? Let me see. Cute! What do you think? You're kidding, right? You've seen our house. - How's it going? - No luck, like you said. He says you might find an older model on the next island. Yes, I understood. - You can use my phone. - Yes, but I have to study. - No luck? - No, unfortunately. Lavinia, can I use it... Giovanni. - Cute. - He's on an island too. It's a sign. - Let me see. - One moment. - Don't log out okay? - Okay. - Log in via internet. - Yes, I'll download the app. This place gives me the creeps. I'm going to the boat. Are you coming? - Bye. - Bye. Hey, I couldn't find a cheap phone on the island, but you can write to me here. I hope tonight's concert goes well. Take some videos then send them to me, okay? Bye. My battery's running low. - Let me text my parents. - Come on. That idiot's even forgotten her bag. Maybe you should drink some water. Lavinia says I shouldn't, but she could have told me before. Listen, if you want, I'll tell him. Remember this is the first time it's happened to me. I can do the test online and I've done a backup. What was that piece by Satie we listened to last summer? I don't have as much data as Lavinia. Okay? We've been together six months and you haven't come out with us once. - Why should I? - You'd understand a lot of things. That he's sick? Being alone makes you really superficial. He's sent you a song. Stop it! Give me that phone. I'm sorry Jenny got sick. I reckon she was jealous that we were coming on the boat with Lavinia. Or maybe she was upset she couldn't lick you all over. - Listen Ca, that grosses me out. - Oh God, I want to vomit. - And anyway, I'm not alone. - Followers aren't real people. And what do you know about it? You know I love you, right? - What the fuck did we drink? - I don't know. What do you mean, didn't you bring it? Okay, how's it going? Tell me everything. Good, good. I'd have preferred to not to be sleeping alone, but... I've already said I'm sorry. - How's Carla? - I don't know, she's okay. Actually no, she's not really. She told us she didn't suffer from seasickness... but she does suffer from seasickness, so it's a mess, these fucking pills... Lavinia? Can you hear me? Hello? Damn this phone! Can you hear me? - Hey! - I can't hear you! Honey, I'll call you later from home. The first story, I mean the first thing about the story you post always has more views. - For the simple reason that. - Yes, because people get bored. Because you click it and swipe. - No, wait... - I know what you mean. ...if you scroll through you see Cicciobello, then you and then Cicchirillo. I only watch the first one. When they go from Cicciobello to Cicchirillo they have to pass yours, but then... - Precisely. - After half a second they get bored. So no one gives a fuck about you. - Exactly. - Ah, okay. - That's sad. Yeah, it's bad, but it's important to see how many views the second one has, and above all if the people who are watching the first one, are also... Analysis of a story. Only post one story a day, to see how many views it gets. No, you have to post two. The intelligent thing would be to post two, like those that view the second one are your best friends. Yes... - Those are your faithful followers. - Your devotees. Then if you post five or six, they watch all six. Yeah, sure. Those are the stalkers. Hey, I can't sleep, it's too hot in here. So I'll make the most of it and study, and hope you're fast asleep. Chat tomorrow. Bye-bye. Every event that takes place in the universe... transmits a signal of some kind, with electromagnetic waves... He's 50 and has a belly. Josko. Listen... Photo, friends... We said we'd film everyone and everything. Now we know Carla and boats don't get along. - I'm not feeling better. - Just stay lying down... Look how beautiful Carla is when she's about to throw up. Come on, Dani! Leave me alone. Listen, Carla, I'm sorry. Haven't you deleted it yet? No, it got loads of likes. "You've got a flabby ass." "You should've fallen in the sea with your vomit." "Forgive me, but honestly, you're disgusting." I'm sorry, Ca. I really am sorry. "You can tell you're used to sucking it on your knees." - I'll delete it, okay? - Is that all you can say? It's the sexist comments that disgust me. Better. Your guy's sent you two texts. Put your hand up like this. Let's make a heart. No, come on! This heat is killing me. I like it. Listen to these cicadas. Don't you find it relaxing? It sometimes seems as though they're singing songs. - Like what? - It depends on your mood... I'm going for a swim, are you coming? In a bit. Fuck, delete that! I say we post it now. What do you reckon? Let her decide. How boring, guys! It's only a video. You're an idiot. Quit playing the victim. I'll show you what it feels like when I really hit you. You're ganging up on me! I see you're not doing a fucking thing without me. We definitely sleep better. Hey, I'll come and visit you in your dreams. - I don't dream, Jenny. - She has a crush on you. Hey. - Hi. - Why don't you join us? No, you guys will be so close by now, you'd be fucking annoying. Look at the power of a positive response on Tinder. Is he cute at least? She's only shown us one photo, but I think so. - Very sexy. Thank you. - Let's hope so. - Okay, make sure she has fun. - Well try. We're going to eat. - Bye. - Bye, Jennina. Hope you die of boredom. - You too. - Bye. Find out anything new about him? Such as? If he has a girlfriend, wife, or kids? Why do you want to know? In case the Tinder guy doesn't work out. And what would you call him? Daddy? I think he's much younger than he looks. If you don't wear sunscreen, you look old at 30. I think he's charming. Just the thought grosses me out. Is there anything that doesn't gross you out? I reckon he masturbates to three girls like us. - Lavinia, stop it. - It's true. I found out he understands Italian. - No, you're good when you try. - I know. Posted. - Why? I asked you not to. - We look really sexy in it. - I'm not joking. - You said you liked it. - Do you ever listen to me? - Calm down, stop exaggerating, okay? You can't do what you want, then insist you're right. - What the fuck do you mean? - You're fucking self-centred. Look who's talking! Come on, we were talking about men at last! Wow, amazing! Well done. Guys, I love you. Drink up. Well done, my love. That's enough. Shit, just pretend! Drink! Thirty thousand! Thirty thousand! Try like this, well done! Perfect. Photo with the star. Amazing! Shit. - My goodness! - Cheek them if you want. Are you okay? Yes, but I still feel a bit sick. - Shall we get off? - No. - Come up front with us. - Maybe later. As you like. When she isolates herself like this I get worried. - Boats don't agree with her. - She could've told us. That's not something she'd do. What do you reckon? Girl power, bitch. Crazy. - I can edit it a bit if you want. - Obviously. - I love you. - Me too. If you'd stayed in Rome you'd have got more studying done. I'm sorry that you're not with me during this tough time with the band. Are you sleeping? Hi, everyone! Today you've given me a wonderful gift. You're wonderful people and like a big family to me. I love you, 30 thousand kisses to everyone. Hi! I'm Lavmi! And today's video is really unique, because I don't know what's going to happen. They only told me I'm going to receive a message and that I have to do everything it says. It's arrived. I'm so excited because I'll find out what will happen and what's written in the message. Hi! I'm Lavmi! And today's video is really unique. Because I don't know what's about... What the fuck did you do? - Wake up! - That hurt. Are you trying to ruin me? Stop it! - You're a fucking jealous bitch. - Jealous of what? Shit, your followers have made you lose your sense of humour! - It was a joke. - You're fucking clueless. Look who's talking. My persona is my work. Oh come on, stop it! It's not even on your profile. Yes, go on, make a scene. Do you want me to take a video? Come on, Lavinia, open the door. I'm busy. Did you see what Carla posted last night? - Did you give her your phone? - No. She took the captain's. She's nuts. Honey, all the comments are positive though... - I look gross. - No, you don't. "How brave to let someone film you you sleep." "You're my hero. We're always beautiful." "We should all be happy to be filmed while we sleep." I think you should thank her. - Can you see that the bed's small? - No way, it's too dark. Don't worry, come on. What will I do without you? You'll come and visit me, right? If they offer me a contract, or you pay for my ticket. Sure, I'll ask my mother. Someone's bound to contact you. I hope so. From September I have to pay for the room at my brother's. Yeah, I'm sure you'll be okay. - What about you? - I'll try. You're leaving me on my own? Lavi, you're going to America not to Bologna. So I'm the bitch because I'm leaving? Come on! Okay... Where are you going Don't do any dangerous stuff. Don't worry. Where's Carla? What do you think? It looks like a vagina. Precisely. I find it artistic. I wouldn't say that. Did she go ashore because she felt sick? You're becoming a bit too obsessed, Dani. Why didn't she ask us if we wanted to go ashore too? Look how cute my friends from Formia are. Yes, but I'm not interested right now. He's written her sixteen texts in the last hour. - Don't believe that it's love. - It's got to be something. A mentally sick 30-year-old guy who hasn't got his act together yet. What has age got to do with it? You know, where I come from, older men will stick themselves into any hole you leave open. Maybe he's different. I don't think so. And what type do you think he is? Okay, he loves sport. Dogs. Surfing. He's the usual guy you find on Tinder. No, but the photos don't translate what's in the messages. Then what's wrong? I'll be right with you. Yeah, yeah, okay. Hey guys, I'm Lavmi. Today's a special day. I was told I will get a message. But I don't know what it is and I have to do everything it says. It's come through. I was on the deck with my friends and I got an all over tan. I don't have one tan line left. You really can't see anything anymore. Not bad, eh? I feel I'm gonna fail the uni entrance test. - It wouldn't be the end of the world. - It would be for me. And I don't have any desire to study anymore. About time. If I don't find something powerful, this bitch will catch up with me. - How many does she have? - 29,300. She's miles off. But she has more comments than me. Don't post anything in this state. Do you have a photo on your phone I could use? Have a look. Come on, help me. Take a photo of the fish. Say he's your mascot, Fish-billypie. Right. You were alive before, now you're eternal. Fish-billyball. Pie. Say hi to Fish-billyball. Come on! I said say hi, damn it! I'm not joking. - What's happening? - The weather's changing. - Does that mean rough seas? - Yes. - You're kidding, aren't you? - I don't understand. If we stay here tonight, we're stuck here for two days. Let's leave straight away then. Maybe we should all decide... I think we should go, too. Okay, seeing as you've decided what to do, I'm taking this for a while. Sorry about the last few days, but they won't let me use their phones, and to send you this message, I had to steal Danila's. - Give it back! - Can you hear her? I've thought about a lot of things I can't wait to talk to you about. Kisses, bye. You should've asked, don't piss me off. Listen, let me finish, okay? Otherwise I'll go into your accounts and create havoc. Four minutes. Three. - Perhaps you should lie down. - I can't move. - Where are we? - We're between two islands. Can we turn back? No, if we go back now, we'll get caught in much rougher seas. We're in the middle of the sea, we don't know if or when we'll arrive. It's been nice to be on this trip with my best friends. Danila, please. Oh damn. - What? - I've lost signal. You're stupid. I'm not joking. She's drunk. Remember that party in year three? The first party we went to together. Which one? That one where you had a photo taken with the older guys after you had sex with them in the toilet. The beginning of the rise. Yes. Did I ever tell you it was planned? Are you serious? - Did you know? - No. I would have told you, but you never asked. How are you feeling? Fine. God, I didn't sleep a wink. My tailbone's sore. Oh God, how beautiful it is here. I'm going to sleep in my bed otherwise I won't be fit tonight. Do you want my phone? No. - It looked good on you. - No, it made me look fat. That's not true. I don't even know why I brought it. - Hurry up! - We'll be right there. I can't do it. Hey, what's up? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know what to wear, I... - Fuck, I'm panicking over a stupid date! - You might really like him. - What if he only wants to screw me? - Do it only if you want to. Ca, I've never done it before. I'm scared. It's okay. - Now you're starting smoking. - Maybe I will. I think it's stupid. Here you go. - Thanks. - Girls, let's take a photo. - Come on, I need some fresh air. - Come a little closer. No. Girls... to us, to ours and to our fucking lives! Like this. What the fuck did you drink? - What's this? - Come on! Come on! I want a picture here. - I'm ready. - Go on. This is for you, Marti! Hurry up! They're filming me. I've taken it. Done. - Let me see. - I've taken plenty. Powerful, fuck! You'll smash her! Well done. - But it says I'm old! - My turn. Carla, Carla, Carla. - Cool. - Yeah! Dani, Dani, Dani. The other one. I feel awful! Come on, come on. Right, what do you want? - I want the speakers. - The drone. - I want the iPhone. - Actually the drone is cool. With the iPhone we could take loads of fucking photos. - But you already have one. - I want another one. With a drone you can take photos from above, of us lying down, the drone passing overhead. Dani, are you sure this is the quickest way? It says we're close. I can't bear it anymore. Take your shoes off. I wouldn't, you can't see a thing. Exactly, I should've waited for him in town and walked up with him. Carla, come on! We're nearly there. - Let's hope so. - Yes. Agitation! What the fuck did you do? I didn't see it was her, I didn't, I swear. Dani, I looked for you everywhere. Where did you look for us? Huh? Dani, I deleted it, it didn't help. You have to call the Internet police, okay? We have to tell her. Jump in. - I'd sink. - Come on, I'm here. I don't feel like it. - Where's Josko? - I don't know. It felt like we were in a dream. I don't remember a thing. You missed the best music yesterday. Forgive me, but I can't bear more than two hours in a club. But I went for a walk and I met Josko who unfortunately is getting married in September. Yesterday, on her way back, Lavinia made a video she should never have made. What kind of video? With the surfer? No. She got lost. What are you saying? Dani, I don't understand, what are you saying? Nothing, maybe it's better if she tells you. Are you okay? So-so. I need to tell you something. At last! What long faces you have this morning! I was only joking, Lavi. What's wrong? Last night he grabbed me by the neck, he hurt me. What? I went looking for you guys but couldn't find you. - It's all my fault. - No. I'll go. What's this story you made up? It's the truth. Did you call the police? I can't do it. Do it for Carla's sake. Lavi, are you here with me? It's too fast there's no way to stop it. It's too fast. You have to find a way. Okay? Do you understand? Thanks. My pleasure. How are you feeling? Fine. Are you sure? I won't need to bother you guys anymore. I'll activate it, then I'll come back and you can tell me everything. Go and talk to her straight away. Lavi, where are you going? You're a real piece of shit. - Where is she? - She didn't do it on purpose. Tell me where the fuck she is! We tried everything to get it removed! Why did she do it? She has to get it removed! Fuck you! Go away! - Let me go! - I'm sorry. Let me go! Ca, we have to stick together. Ca, let me in. Ca? I took the blows that were meant for you. - Say something! - What's wrong? - You do realise what you did? - Yes. Go and talk to Carla! Danila, who the fuck are you? Who the fuck do you think you are? My mother? Dear all. What the fuck do you want? - Fuck, you're spoiled. - Yes. I'm fucking spoiled but I'm not a selfish bitch like you! Dear all, the video from last night shows that while I was having fun, someone else had nothing better to do... Those who know me will know that this won't stop me from being who I am. Carla?
