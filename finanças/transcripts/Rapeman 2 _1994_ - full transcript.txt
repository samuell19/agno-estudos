Wooden balls should be washed with water. When the law is powerless, I will punish the guilty. HIROYUKI OKITA SAKAE U M EZU ATSUKO TAKANO MIYU Kl TANIGAWA SAYAKA TSURUTA MASAMI TOKOSUKA Production by KOJI ABE Written by SHINTARO MIYAWAKI and KEIKO AIZAKI Script by JUN FURUSHO Produced by TOMOYUKI IMAI and TAKEHIRO KIKUCHI Directed by TAKAO NAGAISHI Teacher... where can I find a good part-time job? I thought you already had a job at the convenience store. I quit that one... because I had to stand all the time. And the pay was shitty. Is there a part-timejob that pays $25 an hour? If you find one... let me know. Have you thought about telephone sex? Do you really think so? Stop that... there's no such thing as easy money. You must work and apply yourselves. Why are you so cranked up? I'm not talking about prostitution. I heard that a girl made over $200. I'm shocked... Do you know what you're talking about? No. But you're a man... maybe you have experience. Stop this nonsense. - I think we're on to something. - I bet he does. - I think teacher calls those phone lines. - Sounds like it. What? You say the bride didn't show up for the ceremony? No... she sent this ring back to me the next day. How could something like that happen? I don't know. But... I noticed about a month ago she came in, wearing... very expensive jewellery... and she bought a Mercedes-Benz. Sounds like she found a sugar daddy. Since that time... I felt people were looking at me... like I was an idiot... and my father won't leave home. He feels so ashamed. It's always hard for an old guy. My mother committed suicide. Please... listen sir. Please... I want revenge against Keiko. Please help me. Wow... $30,000. I think I'll put a downpayment on a yacht. What? #302 isn't occupied. Maybe I'd rather have a horse than a yacht. #302 empty. Hello? l5 anyone in here? I thought so... This is some kind ofjoke. You are a dirty whore in a white uniform. Tell me... Did you consider the feelings of your fianc√©'s family? Their disappointment on their glorious day. On your wedding day... I curse you to lose the groom in the same way. What happened? She had a liaison in the empty room. How dare you cheapen our workplace like this. Why? Why only me? You all do the same thing. I don't see you as part of our group. Besides... you enjoy it too much. Please... forgive me... I won't tell anybody about this. - Let's begin. - Yes. Stop it! MaY l help you? Well... I was looking for... the men's room. Fool... it's over there. Land Deed and Lease I'm not really sure... - Mr Araoka... - Yes? There's mention of the rights of the person... who owns the land... not the person who builds on it. There is clearly an advantage for the landowner over... the key holder of the lease. Is that me? Does the landowner want to sue? But let me say... I don't want to make a big deal out of this conflict. I understand... Let me talk to the owner for you. Would you? I'd really appreciate anything a lawyer like you can do. Right... We attorneys aren't only interested in lawsuits. Peaceful settlements are part of ourjob as well. That's so true. Those cosmo's are beautiful. Those are my favourite flowers. Is that right? Do you know the meaning behind those flowers? N0. Cosmo's stand for love... affection... and fidelity. Love. Affection. Fidelity. They are waving in the wind... giving themselves to the breeze, but they are quite strong. Even though they are easily destroyed by the weather... They will grow again from strong roots. That's the essence of the strength of love. True love existing in a turbulent environment. I'm sorry. What the hell? Rikako! Keisuke! I'm sorry. - Come with me... - Eh? Come on, quick! Quick! I can't go anymore. Please... please. Be strong. Come on. Let's go. He? We're going on this? Get down. - What? What? - Don't look. My head. What a mess. Right? What do you mean? It's not my problem... It's yours. What did you do this time? Those two guys are Kowloon Mafia. Kowloon Mafia? Hong Kong Mafia. Before Hong Kong reverts to China... they are desperate to move into Indochina and Japan. I'm trying to get a story on their activities. I almost had a great shot... but they saw me... I don't understand how I keep getting hooked up with you. I thought you were trying 10 help me. You're a nutcase. - God... they're still looking for me. - Eh? We must be very careful. About what? They have the reputation of chasing people into hell. That makes them tougher than Japanese Yakuza. And they know your face too. Shit! Uncle... Who was that lady? I love you, Cosmos Flower... so much. Uncle... are you feeling okay? The meaning behind these flowers... love... affection... fidelity. So his time has finally come... I must see his doctor. And I need to contact the director at Sunflower Orphanage. I need to get help for him. Keisuke... Don't worry... I haven't caught Alzheimer's Disease yet. I'm in love. In love? Yes. I forgot how it squeezes my heart. You need to go to the hospital. Grandpa... Little Mina... good to see you. Here. What i5 this? We always appreciate how you take care of Mina. This is a picture she drew in her kindergarten class. Is this me? Yeah. Let me see. Yes. It looks exactly the same. You're a great artist. You did very good. Mina believes you are her real grandfather Mr Araoka. That's real good... thank you Mina. Can I have this as a gift from you? Yes. I will take good care of this. I'll buy a frame for it. And put it in my office. Would you draw a picture of me next time? I promise I'll playjump-rope with you. That's nice. We have to go now. 3Y9 bye. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. It seems you like to be called grandpa. Weren't you just saying... Love... affection... fidelity. How gov'!!- What are you saying? You don't know about nature. Accident? Let's go. Mina... Mina... Araoka! Keisuke! Mina! Little Mina! Be strong... she'll be alright. Etsuko... My dear... What about Mina? Have you heard? Nothing. How did it happen? She was with you. I'm very sorry. Take it easy... It wasn't her fault. There was a driver who ran a red light. Doctor... what about Mina? Mina did great. Don't worry. That means...? Hospitalization for a month or so... But she's going to be alright. Thank you very much. Take care. Very good news. We define death... when the function of the brain stops. If a patient is dead by your definition... Do you agree with the practice of organ transplant? This principle has nothing to do with a doctor's opinion... It depends on how the patient views death. As a matter of fact... we have very few organ donations... from families who witness brain death. Don't you think I still look young? Where should we hang it? Well... Look... Do you have an opinion on the scarcity of organ donors? We expect to see this scarcity... That lady is a famous doctor. Seems to be. In the near future... man-made organs will solve the problem. And do you feel this will be acceptable...? Mina was very lucky to have such a good doctor. I bet she'll be out ofthe hospital in no time. I can't wait to see her smile again. This is the moment I've been waiting for... here goes. Is that cocaine? Turn around... This is a souvenir from Hong Kong. "Iv gm. Do you like it? Very much. Enjoy it. Let's go. See you. Shit... is this worth the scoop? Hospital? This is getting exciting. Good afternoon... Thank you grandpa. Get well soon. Yes. Mina... do you want something? I want Mickey... What is Mickey? Old man... of course... Mickey Mouse. Yes. I didn't know you liked Mickey mouse. Butl like Donald Duck as much. When you get well we'll take you to Disneyland. Yes. I really appreciate you guys being here. Yes... Chief doctor's visit. This is Chief Doctor Tachibana. Thank you very much for visiting... Okay. You look very good. She should be getting out of here very soon. Thank you very much. See you soon. Thanks again. Did you hear what he said? She'll be out soon. Yes... I'm not sure, but our chief doctor was recommended... as the national candidate for the association. He deserves it... he's very special. Very special, right. If he were ten years younger I would've attacked him. . Can I help you? Nothing... I'm going... I'm sorry. Terribly sorry. That's alright... Are you okay? It's nothing. I'm very sorry. Thank you. Nurse, would you deal with this one? Yes. Come in. Excuse me. Chief Doctor... what should I do with the case? Well... let's use the patient in ward 202. 202? This is an opportunity from God. Do you understand? Yes. This is a gift from a prosperous country to an unfortunate one. Am I making sense? Yes. Absolutely clear. You understand me. That's very good. I trust you. Yes. An opportunity from God? A gift from an Asian country? This... can't be true... can it? Doctor... you said she was okay. How did this happen? I'm sorry. Give Mina back to me. Doctor. Doctor. Grandpa. I hate all this work here. We're doing the work Kanazawa is supposed to do. Kanazawa? I don't understand why she quit. I guess she got a new boyfriend. But she just cancelled her engagement. That's nothing new, she'll never settle down. I wouldn't disappear because of a new boyfriend. Why? Why only me? You all do the same thing. I don't see you as part of our group. Besides, you enjoy it too much. Please... forgive me... I won't tell anyone about this. Let's begin. Yes. Stop it! MaY l help you? Thank you for your assistance. Excuse me. Uncle... I think there's something fishy. Like what? We need to wait for the autopsy results. We'll see what happens later. Please help us. We'll be okay. ltrust this attorney. I'll do my best. Please be strong. Maybe I can help. Have a seat. What do you want? I can't bear it any longer. My son is in so much pain... in that hospital. Please, I'm begging you. I want to see my son smile again. Money is no object... please. I understand you... trust me. Thank you very much. Your dream will come true. Right away... Yes. What's wrong girls? It's too early to be tired. You're not fair... you're on a bike. Get moving... if you keep bitching, I won't give you credit. Go. Go. Hurry. Please. Take care of your wife. Keisuke... It didn't go well. What? The result of the autopsy wasn't good. The hospital doesn't have any liability. I don't see a case here. I understand. I think we betterjust let her rest. We don't want to cause any more stress for the family. Miss Yagi... Yes. You finished the tests. You should be leaving the hospital today. What? What's wrong? I want to check everything out. From my head to my toes... I want to be sure everything's okay. Are there any exams I haven't taken yet? I don't think so... Please, make sure. I understand your fear. I'll ask the doctor. Yes. My wife is sick in bed. She still believes the doctor is responsible for Mina's death. She even made threats against the doctor. I understand. To be honest, I don't feel well either. But... I know what you're going to say. But I can't let Mina's memory go. What i5 this? Iwant to make the one responsible feel my anger. I don't think Mina would like this, but... I can't face my wife. I understand, but... Please help us. You don't think the patient will last beyond tomorrow? What can I do? You don't have a donor in mind? It's very difficult right now. Well... Before then... I hope we have a new patient in Emergency. What do you think? I know Dr Noda seems fishy. I don't quite see the connection with Mina's death. The autopsy showed nothing suspicious. This goes against our credo... To rape someone out of anger. But I still want to help. Should we turn this job down? I still think it's strange about that nurse who disappeared. We can research it a bit. Hands up. What are you doing here? Well... well... How was l? Rikako! HGY- I pissed my pants. What are you doing here? As you can see... I am... a patient. You saw Dr Noda and the mafia in a meeting? They had some kind of business transaction. Do you think there's some connection with the missing nurse? That's it! What? I thought the nurse came into money because of a sugar daddy. But that wasn't it at all... there was another reason. What does that mean? The nurse found out about the mafia and the hospital. That's why... she threatened to blackmail them. That's it. She threatened the hospital. So... I overheard a conversation about helping an unfortunate Asian country. And an opportunity from God. Opportunity from God? I wonder if the chief doctor has something to do with this... I will do some detective work from inside. Be careful. What i5 this? What are you doing here? Excuse me... where is patient Rikako Yagi? Yagi... hold on. Miss Yagi... she left yesterday. Left? This is Rikako and I'm not at home right now... I can be reached at the hospital, Room 206. Or leave a message at the tone. It can't be. Can't be? What's that? I'm afraid she might already be dead. This can't be happening. But it is... she's not at home, and she's not at the hospital. If she left the hospital she would've called us. There's something shady... There's something shady going on between the Chief and Dr Noda. I think Mina was killed by them. Uncle... Let's do it. We can't let them getaway with this. It's a disgrace to the name of Rapeman. Let's do it. Is that right? She was a reporter? Yes... but we don't need to worry. She's not going to share information with anyone now. That's true... besides, we are only helping people. We are on the side of the righteous. I think she was investigating some criminal activities. I understand and also believe there's something fishy here. Did Rikako give you any news before she disappeared? N0... nothing at all. Is that right?... I see. This is about life or death... we should inform the police. Thank you... please help us. Yes... that's right. Please. Immediately. Yes. They will begin an investigation right away. That's great. I hope Rikako is alright. Yes... all we can do now is wait. Can I get you some coffee? Fine. Thank you. I'm a very big fan of yours, I really enjoy your company. I like hearing that, even if it's lip-service. I'm not lying, but I guess I'm too old for you. I'm flattered. Here. For you. Blue mountain? Yes. What's the relationship between your hospital and the mafia? Alright. Answer! Tell me. Organs... Organs? Really... Where is Nurse Kanazawa? What happened to her? Answer! Did you kill her? Answer. Did you kill her? You must know about the patient who disappeared from your ward. Tell me. Tell me about it. Talk! Tell me about her. We're planning to fix her tonight. Fix her? Does that mean remove her organs? Please come in. Hello... thank you for your trouble. Your fee will be paid right away. Can you use him as an organ donor too? Yes. Have a seat. We'll deal with him. But bodies are difficult to get rid of. Perhaps we should dump his body in his office and set a fire. You are a surprising lawyer Yasuda. Excuse me. Yes. Mr Lam is here. Dr Tachibana... Long time no see. Greetings. Miss Yasuda... you are prettier all the time. Thank you very much. When is the operation? Within minutes. Is that right'? Very good. Can I see the donor's face? Of course. Be my guest. Thank you. This way sir. Where is Dr Noda? She should be in her office. Oh... she looks healthy. In think we'll get good organs from her. Rikako... What's going on here? He's just a mouse, sneaking around the hospital. Who are you? He's too big to be a mouse. I've never seen such a big mouse, even in Hong Kong. But organs from mice aren't any good. What about his eyeballs? Aren't they good? What's going on, Miss Attorney? Let's begin. Rikako! What are you doing with Rikako? I can't believe it. It can't be... Tell me you're kidding. I will tell you two things... Mina was killed for her organs, and you are too old for me. I'm sorry... Excuse me... I'm looking for somebody. Nam Myo Horenge-Kyo. Nam Myo Horenge-Kyo. Uncle! What are you doing here? I'll explain later... we've go! to hurry. Rikako is in the operating room. Which? Keisuke! Come on. Keisuke... The lady attorney is part of their team. What? They killed Mina for her organs. Shit! I will call a detective friend. Wait. Be careful. I know. I... I am so angry. We must... act quickly, before the police arrive. Listen... I hereby hire Rapeman for a job. Please rape the lady attorney. Please. Uncle, I accept your offer. Keisuke. I trust you. It contains more than usual. Thank you. Attorney Yasuda... here's your fee. Thank you. How's the condition of the hospital business? Because ofthe organ sales... it's in very good shape. Don't you think the operation is over by now? Yes. I'm going to check. You exchanged a sinless life for money. Think about the torment of the parents who lost their child. The police will be here soon. Alright. But before that I want the chance to smash her face. Where is she? We'll look for her. A woman like you must be sent to hell. I didn't kill by myself. "Didn't kill' by yourself?" You're even more sinful to have helped the killers... You are a representative of the law. You killed! What's taking so long? I'll check... be right back. Who is it? You want money? Take it. Take it. When the law is ineffective... I will punish the guilty. Mina... I will try to live longer to make up for your short life. Uncle... there will be more hardships facing us. But we must do it... otherwise the world will never be safe. Let me pray for her. Poor little Mina. If doctors and attorneys are like those people... I don't know what to believe in anymore. That's true. Trust never exists without faith in someone. Without trust, relationships are empty. It's becoming more difficult to find somebody trustworthy... among politicians, attorneys, doctors and other respectful jobs. What about teachers? What?
