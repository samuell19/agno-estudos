Mom! Dad! Carol! Carol! In your opinion, what is your most valuable asset? Well, I think we're never prepared for a challenge of this nature to be really honest. Man is the absolute example of adaptation, the ultimate legacy of science. The planet is a living organism. If we care for it, it can give you so much in return. Man is an expert in changing his environment but then make it to his benefit. To me, having a full understanding that there is no situation that we can't adapt to. This is gonna give me the right kind of mindset to succeed. The only thing that I'm really good at is taking care of people. I'm gonna be all alone on an island and the only person that I have to take care of is myself. What we perceive about ourselves and the truth about ourselves are two completely different things. Every single thing that happens to us in life is nothing more than what we project onto the world. We simply create it with the power of the mind. A true survivor has to be a person who understands the environment and changes it with technology and tools. The main reason people drop out of the show is they don't realize how difficult it is to be alone with themselves. The air you breathe, the food you eat, the medicines you need, the water you drink, it literally gives you life. What's the absolute definition of God, if not love? I hate to brag, but I'm gonna win this thing. I am. I am, come on! You all have been previously briefed about all the rules. Even though there's not that many, stay safe, stay warm, don't get injured, and try to feed yourself. As you all know, you are being left on this island with almost nothing except your skills and your survival instincts. Welcome to Solum Island. My name is Emilia and I'm your host. First of all, let me personally applaud each one of you just for being here. I know that gaining admission is far from being easy. That being said, the last one of you to give up this competition will be the absolute winner. If you want to or decide to give up and drop out of this competition, there are two ways you can do it. One, by using this radio. The second way is to use the extraction point. Enough of this chitchat. Now you'll be taken to different parts of this amazing island. As soon as you get there, the game is on. Now, go and made the best win. This seems easier than it actually is. I don't know how people can start a fire with this, and this is freaking moisture, man. Everything is wet all over the place. Believe me guys, this is way harder than it looks on TV. Hey folks. So, the main problem with finding shelter on a high location of the island is the wind, but for me it was a priority to find an area that would be natural protection against it. So, I followed the rock formations and I found, this. Ah! Look at this five star hotel. No wind. Like I said folks, it's all in the brains, and I think we're gonna camp right over here. Put some branches against the wall. I got one right here, actually. It's a heavy one. Okay. Put some branches... I think I'm gonna need my both hands to do this. Huh? Peace. Woo! It's funny how overwhelming this place is, and how it makes me feel at home at the same time. Now that I'm here, I feel that maybe throughout my whole life, I've been preparing myself for this. This is exactly where I should be. Yep. I was right. The ax was by far my best choice of an item. And what a productive day. Four trees down, so I guess I'm ready to start my first project on this show. I really hope it pays off. Woo hoo! Okay , here we are. Day one, actually, night one. This has to be one of the first challenges that we all face, being alone in the dark with ourselves. Yeah. I haven't eaten yet. I spent my whole day trying to build this kind of shit that I'm in right now. And thank God I chose this plastic cloth as my item. You know that knowing stuff is not the same as being good with stuff. Yeah. Well, tomorrow I better try and find some food if I wanna stay in this game. And for now, I'm gonna try to get some sleep, although the noises on this island at night are something else. Yeah. Okay. May all sentient beings everywhere, experience this. Namaste. All right. Good morning. You know what? This is just incredible. I mean, I just slept in this wonderful beach under the stars and wow, I feel so lucky and what you're about to see is nothing more than a man at one with nature. And while you watch this, I want you to take just a very brief moment and be grateful. Be grateful for things that we take for granted sometimes. Be grateful for the food you eat every day, for your family, for your friends who are family in a way aren't they? I want you to be grateful for, I don't know, the sound of these waves. I mean, it's just such a beautiful sound and I promise you that if you focus on this feeling of gratefulness, you will be absolutely overwhelmed with joy. That's a promise I make. Here we go. Woo hoo! Well, hello there. Oh, wow. Man. What a night. So, the place where I was saying before, it was extremely humid. There was no way I could make a fire and I trained how to do it, I know how to do it. So I had to look for someplace else and ta da! I made fire. So, I found this awesome rock wall, let me show you, where I used it as my crashing place for tonight. Pretty cool. And on my way here, I found some snails. So, my pan I chose to bring is already paying off because ladies and gentlemen, yours truly has made some snail stew! What? Yeah, I know. It sounds pretty gross. Not gonna talk about that now but... So... I was prepared for fevers. I was prepared for food poisoning. I might've been the only one actually prepared for such things but... On the second day of this competition, I broke my leg. I'm not stupid and I know I can't carry on with something like this knowing that my leg could only get worse without the proper treatment. So, I can't continue with this. I'm... I'm gonna have to tap out, guys. Doctor's orders. I'm really sorry. A fishing net for dummies. Hey. I thought we were meant to spread apart? Hey dude, how's it goin'? Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Hey, what are you... Hey, hey! Shit! So, one of the main problems we face over here is to keep ourselves dry. Now, knowing that the main source of food in the island has to come from the water, getting fish without getting wet is quite of a challenge. And that's why, I'm building a raft. Isn't that awesome? With his raft, I actually can go toward the fishes, but not only that. I can look for other locations that can provide me shelter. So, stay tuned 'cause Kristoff is going to win this thing. Hi, everyone. How are you doing? I'm doing great, especially because remember that problem that I had yesterday related to not finding any food? Well, seems like I found the solution. Everyone, this is Paul, as you might know. Paul, say hi. Hey. He's nice. He had some sort of a technical problem with his camera equipment. I'm not even sure we are allowed to team up in this competition, but at least for now it comes in handy for me. I am starving and he's cooking me dinner. Carol, come over here, please. Quietly. My new friend seems a bit camera shy. - What? - Shh! Talk to me. What's happening? You should stay here. Something's coming, we should hide. Hide, why? 'Cause we don't know what it is. What? Why is that a problem? There's only two options. Either it's an animal or another contestant. Let's hope it's an animal. Are you insane? Are you okay? I've just been hit in the head. How do you think I am? Are you all crazy? I'm sorry. He thought you were an animal or something. Well guess what? It was the something. Sorry, man, I thought you were a- - What, that guy who was chasing me around? I'm Carol, what's your name again? My name's Scott. What do you mean chasing? Well, look, I was at the beach and all of a sudden this guy started coming after me and attacking me. For your food? For my ass. What am I supposed to know? Why would he do that to you? Did you lose him? No, I actually brought him along. I thought what a lovely idea. Let's have dinner on live television. What kind of a question is that, man? Listen, I was doing my own thing, minding my own business and the guy started running after me but yes, I did, I lost him. How, how did you lose him? Paul, please back away! I found a hiding place. The guy didn't see me, he just kept going on. And I was like, "Gotta stay here, gotta stay focused. Do not fall asleep." But yeah, then I fell asleep. I knew it. We can't stay here. Carol, pack your stuff. What do you mean you knew it? What do you mean pack my stuff? Come on, we gotta move. Hey, she asked you a question, man, and I happen to be interested in the answer as well. Yeah. Is there something we should know? We're not going anywhere until you explain. I should've known you'd say something like that. Hey, where are you goin', man? Okay. I was trying to find some foods and guess what? Nothing. I mean, I'm not picky. I can eat anything as long as it doesn't kill me. Guess what? I think I just found another contestant. We're supposed to be spread apart. But come on, this is an island. There's only so many places we can go. Hey! Hey, are you okay? Shit! Oh! Oh. She's dead. He had this shift you know, when you said you were being chased. He changed. Really? Why do you think the guy was after you? I told you, to scare the hell out of me. With a bow and arrow? Yeah. Do you think there's a slight chance he might want it to kill you? No. No, of course not. You crazy? I mean, would he kill me live on television? No, come on. I'm sorry, you're right. I can say some really stupid things sometimes. No, no. I didn't mean that at all. I don't think you're stupid. I think you're just open-minded. You contemplate every possibility. If anything, that would be the opposite of stupid, right? Yeah. You know, when I was a kid, I guess I was different. I would find objects that meant something to me and I would talk to them as if they were real people. I would have a full argument with my grandmother's rocking chair, asking who its parents were and where they came from. My first friend was a bind weed. Of course, when I told the other kids about it, they thought I was weird and they wanted to stay away from me. But every time I would get home, I would have a bind weed trying to get into my room through the window. My parents got a bit worried so they took me to a doctor, and I was always very ashamed of my own sensitivity, until I was told it was a gift. Oh, yeah absolutely. You see, we all have gifts inside us when we're born. And I think life is just this wonderful journey where we discover these gifts and we embrace them. You see, I don't think life is about right or wrong or black or white. I just think life is a bunch of maybes and a couple of what ifs? That's it. You're good. Yeah, I'm pretty good. It's pretty effective stuff, huh? Good morning, Miss. Not really. What? Someone missing her fluffy feather bed? Yeah. At least Paul left us some breakfast here. Mm hm. I had the strangest dream. - It was- - Run! What the hell? What? Run! Where? - We gotta go, move! - What's going on? - What is it? - What? - What's happening? - Grab your stuff and go now! What is it just- - Fuck. - Fuck, come on! - Carol, hey, come on! - Run, run, run, run! - What the hell's happening? - Just shut up and run! Come on, Carol, come on! Fuck! Go, go, come on! Fuck! Let's go! I need some food. Run, Carol, come on! Hey, hey, help us! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, come now, come on. What are you running from? It's not what, it's who. Come on, he's too dangerous! Okay, just spit it out! What are you - not telling us, man? - What do you mean? Paul, please! What's going on? Exactly, what the hell is going on? We're being chased by one of the other players. What? - Yeah, he's shooting arrows. - This is to exposed. We gotta go! If that's true, we should call this out. No, no, what do you think you're doing? What do you mean what- - Are you giving up? No, I'm not giving up. I'm calling for help. I'm telling them that there's a guy shooting freaking arrows at people. I wouldn't do that if I were you. What? That's what he wants you to do. He wants you to give up! I saw it in your eyes. When Scott mentioned he was being chased, you didn't even react. You weren't surprised. No, I wasn't surprised. Whoa, whoa, you guys are getting too weird. I'm calling the cavalry. Only when you're ready to give up and I mean really give up, only then do you push that button, not a moment before! What the hell do you mean by that? We need to get to higher ground. Why? I felt it! Paul, Paul, listen! Carol, come on! Look, I don't trust this guy. Well, at least he's not chasing you with a bow and arrow. I think we should follow him. Where are we going? Higher. Do you think we'll be safe there? Not safe, safer. I'm still not getting, why are we following a person who as far as we know could be as crazy as the other guy? Do you have a better plan? Yeah, I do. We should call this out. Scott thinks he's just trying to scare us off. Wait a minute. You're saying he was put here for show purposes? That will make sense. In that case, we can be like some sort of a defense structure. I have a feeling that this guy chasing us might not be the only thing we have to defend ourselves from. What's that supposed to mean? Your name is Kristoff, right? Yeah. What's up with the accent? What accent? Hey. Hey. - Hey- - No, uh uh! - No, no, no! - Nuh uh! Listen, calm down, calm down. We're not gonna hurt you, we're not gonna hurt you all right? We're not gonna hurt you. Yeah right. Is this your camp? No. Is this yours? What are you doing here? I could ask you the same question. I'm just trying to find some sense in all of this, okay? In someone's backpack? I'm just trying to try and- - Where's the owner of the bag? I have no fucking idea. Have you tried to look for him? Calm down, calm down. Calm down, calm down. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Just didn't understand what you said. Are you okay? Have you eaten? Not much. Okay, we'll get you some food on the way. We haven't got time for food. We need to leave now. I need to breathe. We're being chased. What? Oh my God. I thought it was just me. I hid in a tree when something came after me. Oh shit, these fucking stupid, fucking freaking reality TV shows! They do anything for ratings. They must be trying something new to get people's attention. Look, I still think that the best thing to do here is use the radios- - No, you can't use that. You can't use that. Guys, you gotta see this. What's the matter with you guys? The logical thing to do here is use the radio- Something happens if we use the radio. You are all insane. She's right. No matter what we do, we're screwed. I know I can't carry on with something like this knowing that my leg can only get worse without the proper treatment so, I can't continue with this. I'm... I'm gonna have to tap out, guys. Doctor's orders. I'm really sorry. So, you can go 30 days without food but a few days without water and you're a dead man. That's why it was a good thing I found this. I know, it doesn't look too delicious but all I gotta do, is boil it and it'll taste like nice, fresh, spring water. And that folks is why I picked this canteen as my item. I don't know how the other guys are gonna do it. We're set. Let's go find some food. I'm hungry, hangry. Woo! There is a garden, gray, with mists of water and tide. Under the giant bows, stretched green on every side. What do you want? I want the truth. What are you talking about? The beauty, like the one from the poem you just say. This beauty. It doesn't exist anymore. You are insane. No, I am the purge. So what are you going to do now? Are you going to kill me? I don't wanna kill you. You see that was it. What started to trigger me. I don't wanna kill you, I don't wanna kill anyone. All I do is give them the signal. They are the ones doing the killing. They could've helped us here. Why didn't they help us here? I don't buy that shit. I don't buy your shit. I don't need you to. Hey! Easy. Easy, guys. Well, where's Paul? Right here. Drop it. Are you sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. If you're watching this, it means that you're the last on the station. It also means that I'm most likely dead or hidden away in a bunker somewhere with the others. At least until our food and oxygen supplies run out. Look, we're not certain if at this stage you've already regained your memory. But if not, oh God. I have to tell you, don't go outside. Oh, for Christ sake. So stupid. Fucked up the world. We wish you the best. And hope that one day, all this can be forgotten. Paul, where are we? It's okay, you're safe. I don't know what's happening to me. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. Hey! Put her down. Home sweet home. I think I'm gonna get some more wood. It's gonna be a long night. How are we on food? Not good. What happened to the guy? We took care of him. I'm gonna try and catch some dinner. I'm going with you. No, you should stay here, it's safe. I said I'm going with you. What's going on? We were being chased and now we're good. Stop with the bullshit, okay? What's going on? What do you mean? I think you know exactly what I mean. The guy wanted you specifically and now I'm having these dreams or visions. I don't freaking know what it is, okay? I just know it feels real. Dreams of what? Of this facility or lab. How is that possible? I don't know. No, I mean that you remember? That I remember? No, I meant- - Stop it, okay? Stop it. Tell me right now, what the fuck do you know? It doesn't matter what I know. The only thing important is keeping you safe. Keeping me safe? Why me? You don't freaking know me- - This is selection process! Life on Earth is ending. We screwed everything up. We poisoned the environment, created nuclear wars, used our natural resources. We got to the point of no return. It's our chance to survive. Our chance? Humanity. Our species. I was working as a radio astronomer when they first contacted us. They said that they were coming. For years, I tried to prove that they've been here before. Paul, who are they? Our planet is no more. They came to save a few of us. A few of the best. You are insane. I don't understand. We're here, we're fine. It's all good. This is not, none of this is real, Carol. This is not a reality show. You're not on a beautiful island. This is all- - This has all been projected into your mind while your body is in the last station running the selection. No, no, no. This is not happening. Hello, Solum. Congratulations. Are you ready? My name is not Solum. Solum means exclusive, only, and that's what you are. I know exactly what I am. What are you? I am a collector made into your image to ease the process of understanding. That sounds great, but it doesn't answer my question. What are you? Your spheres, may I see them, please? Are you talking about this? My goodness. This is too much for me. I need some answers. It's completely understandable. What is happening? What is this? This, me. Everything was created for the encounter. Encounter? You mean, you and me? And mine. You're alien. I am not alien. I am a program created to establish the first contact. For years humans have sent radio messages so the stars try and reach us. They finally succeeded. We were applied immediately, but there was no response. Why was there no response? We can't save you all. What happened? All of this with the global warming and that and a lot of it's a hoax, it's a hoax. If the atmosphere's that sensitive, we wouldn't be talkin' about this right now. We'd be sweating bullets. About global warming, it's the greatest fraud that's been perpetrated on mankind this century. You are the last best hope of Earth. I'd like to talk to you about the end of our country, the end of the world. Hey. You okay? Do you want some water or something? Where's Paul? Ah, never mind Paul. He told us. Told you what? Nothing. This crazy story about us not really being here, about us being in some lab. Look, listen, it doesn't make any sense, okay? I know. I know it makes no sense. I couldn't agree more. I'm getting tired of this bull crap. I didn't sign up for this shit. Look, Carol, sometimes when we just had a traumatic experience, it is normal that we deviate a little bit from reality. Exactly. What do you mean exactly? Traumatic experience can affect your judgment, your thoughts. It camouflages your spirit, so your instinct focuses on one thing. Survival. Oh, come on, man. I'm tired of this bullshit. Aliens? Really? Aliens. I didn't say aliens. Well, whatever the fuck you said, Paul, nonhuman intelligent beings, and you were the one speaking to them, right? That's what you're telling me. That's the story you want us to believe? So, what? Now we're supposed to believe that the planet got to this point where life is no longer an option. I mean, you're telling me that my body, my soul, me being here right now, that's not real. That's some sort of virtual reality created by these spheres and your only shot at surviving is to jump into a fucking alien ship! I didn't say- - No, I'm saying aliens, man, I am! Or what? Are you the only one entitled to create stories around here, huh? Look, this is completely ridiculous, okay? And I'm pretty sure they have freaking hidden cameras all over the place and they're shooting this mumbo jumbo story, and you know what? They're expecting us to believe it. So let's just play along. Oh, tell us your story, Paul. What happens to the rest? The ones who don't go? They sent spheres all over the world so we can access the selection. It all happened so fast, but we found a way to trick the spheres. Oh! It didn't always work. It certainly didn't work for everyone but it did for some. It worked with you. Not just me. He was my friend. He was the one who figured out how to trick the spheres. So, did I trick the spheres? Not the way we did. So how can I go back there and then back here? I've no idea. How do animals sense an earthquake before it happens? Maybe there's something special about you. He's coming! He's alive! He's headed this way! - What? - Come on, let's go! Go, go, go. Hey, where's Paul? Hey! - Have to be careful. - What are we doing? - We have to- - Shh, please! We don't have much time. Remember I was mentioning the extraction point? Yes, but we have to- - Keep heading to the top of the island until you find it. Listen, you have to go now and don't look back. Come with me, then. Only one of us can be saved, and make sure it's you. Why are you doing this? Because once I made a vow, for better, for worse. We were married? We gotta go! Wait a sec. Where are we goin'? Where is she? I don't know, man. I don't know. I told you, she was right behind me. - I don't know! - We need to go! Guys! Carol! - Hurry! - Guys, we need to get to the top of the mountain! The guy chasing us, I thought you killed him? - Yeah? - He flew into a pit. No one could survive that- No! Fuck! Oh my God. Lets go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Wait, wait. Stop, Liam. It doesn't have to be like this. That's exactly what I said when they killed him. My brother was a good man. He was smart, he was kind, he was strong. He said he trusted their judgment. Now he's dead. They didn't force us, Liam. They're giving us a way out. Your brother volunteered just like we did. Says who? Your friends? The ones who came to save us? I mean, think, man, think! If they really wanted to save us, with all that technology they would do it right here. Instead they're just killing us on this false pretense of salvation. How do you know? Huh? How do you know we're not just some stupid TV show for them? How do you know, Paul? Look around, Liam. We destroyed this, not them. We're a reckless species that destroys everything leaving only chaos behind. That's who we are. That's what I know. That's really how it is? Then that's how it is supposed to be. No other way. People like you- - People like me are honest for less and we will die last! I gotta help him. No wait! We have to get for the extraction point. Paul said it's the only way. He's buying us time isn't he? Okay, let's go, go! Who did all this my friend? You? Me? Mankind? Of course you can understand. Liam, please! We have the right to our own destiny. They can't, they will not take that away from us. They killed my brother and I'll be the one getting a bomb on that ship. Rest in peace my friend. Carol! Stop, stop. Listen to me. I'm not sure of what's going on but I know two things. This guy's tryin' to kill us and Paul just gave up his life to make sure we made it to the extraction point. We gotta go. We gotta go now. Come on. Shit. Emma! - Emma, come on. - I know. - We gotta keep going. - Come on. - We gotta keep going. - Emma, come on. Come on, come on. We have to get to the extraction point. - Come on. - Oh, I can't! You can do it, you can do it. You can do it. Listen to me! I'm gonna find a place to hide and you need to go right now. - Right now! - No, no! I'm not leaving you behind. Emma, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. Where are the others? I guess they left. They left you behind? Twisted ankle. Couldn't go far. Why would you stay here? Where would I go? Home is not of option. Look, I'm a psychiatrist. I can help you. I don't need your fucking help. Hey, stop it! Let her go, right now. Let her go. Drop it or she dies. Please, Liam, stop it. I know what you're doing. I've seen it all. No you don't. I need to stop them. Drop it. Don't listen to him, he's gonna kill us all anyway. Do it! I'm telling you for the last time. No! See you on the other side you motherfucker. Scott! We have to keep going. I cannot do this alone, Scott. It's bind weed. Your first friend, remember? Go. I'll come back for you. It's true. Hard to believe isn't it? Sometimes the man can have the truth right in front of his eyes, still don't believe it. What happens once Carol gets to the extraction point? There's no extraction point. What do you mean, Liam? Paul said it was the- - Paul, Paul had a plan. He was gonna make sure his wife survives. No matter what. He would kill any of you to make sure that. Including you. Just as I would, just for a different reason. So, then that extraction point is the only way the winner can get out of- - There's only one way for you to win. To be the last one alive. Paul was right. We did this. We were greedy. We were greedy. That's what destroyed us. You know, I used to tell people to be grateful, to appreciate life, to find joy, to find their purpose in order to find peace. Look at her. Scott. You think she killed herself? She pushed the button. She did what they wanted. She told 'em she was weak. Not me. No way. I'm not doing that. I'll go out by my own rules on my own terms. So I'm asking you, man, help me. What do you want? What do you want from me? I want you to kill me. Give me some dignity. Give me peace. Don't listen to him, he's gonna kill us anyway, do it! Sometimes a man can have the truth right in front of his eyes and still don't believe. Me being here right now, that's not real. There's only one way to be the winner. To be the last one alive. Ready? How can anyone be? When I'm there alone, turns not his head, lifts not his eyes. Heeds not as he plays on. And I'm there alone. Forlornly, silently, plays in the evening garden, myself, with me.
