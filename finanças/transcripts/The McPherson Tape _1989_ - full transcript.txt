So, Jason just yanked on the line- Michael, will you just sit down, and eat some supper? And away the boat goes. Fine, okay. It's working now. Look at this toy. Now, the year's over. Pretty cool, huh? When did you get that? I got it last week. Just last week? Uh-huh. Yes, just be careful. Don't start to pick your nose, 'cause he goes for you. It's blackmail. I'll be on my best behavior then. It's blackmail, and it costs $10. Yeah, right. When you use the bathroom, make sure you close the door real well. And if you use the bathroom, make sure you turn the light on and check the seat, 'cause with all these men, I could never get- I just heard letters, you know? I don't know. When I'm in, get it out of my face. - I think you've got Eric broken now, haven't you? - How do we know this thing is working here, Mikey? - There should be a red light somewhere. There's not. Right- - There's no light. - There's no light. Let me see. Foolin' you! - He looks like, you know, he's gonna get a suntan, and that one eye is just gonna be white. A little raccoon action. Yeah, a little raccoon action. - I think it's great, 'cause it's like a Manhattan shirt guy with a Manhattan shirt on. It shows you how well, like, there's some kind of genetic memory, the fact that Jason can remember what he looked like, from the fact that he hasn't seen him for a couple months, he's been away at school, but what he's got? He's got this growth off the side of his shoulder- Got a couple growths, matter of fact. Look at the stuff on his face! - Look it, look it, look it. - Look at that. - Put a little milk on it, and let the cat lick it off. It's a beard! A beard? Yeah. Yeah, right. Peach fuzz on his face. Peach fuzz. He finally hit puberty. - Yeah, his voice has been cracking, and everything. Action! So, how's school going? It's going good. It's. - We're so glad you could come this week. I'm so glad he made me up. He's been promising to take me for awhile, and then one thing or another, and he hasn't, but he will- He's told us all about you, so we've been looking forward to meeting you. - He sure does like that camera. Oh, yeah. Does that mean he's creative? Oh, come on, Michael! Stop it! - Stop playing with your food, Michael. He's mostly playing with it. It's like, if you play with it, it gets off the plate, and it's going- I got a close up lens on this. Hold on, hold on. Hey, hey, hey- - He would have a real good time in the 60s. Jamie. Hold on, hold on, wait. What does it look like if we put vinegar on your lens? - I should have brushed my teeth beforehand. I've heard a few stories. Salad? No, you're fine. Look, when you're there, you should be working out now, you should be going to the batting cages. Are you going to the batting cages? I really missed this guy, you know? He's not that talkative, but when he wasn't here, it was so quiet. - 'Cause it's gonna show. First day of practice- - No, all these other guys are out partying. She don't let me go out and party, so my mom's gonna give her the third degree. - It must be hard since you lost your husband. Well, yeah. I mean, most of the time, I get along just fine, but you know, long about separate time- She's so cute. I catch myself- - You even have a happy plate on your birthday, sorta. Footsteps at the back door, and then I think oh, he's not coming in. We were pretty worried, you know, being this close to Halloween, what she would like when she came out. It'll nearly get dark, and I'll think where is this man? 'Cause he never came in past dark. She's taking after Mom, so that's okay. Jason doesn't talk about him. It almost kind of worries me. I feel like he should. They didn't talk about it. This isn't a porno. - They think I talk about it too much. It's not a movie. It's her birthday. - I mean, I've been told the first year is the hardest. I surely know. I remember when my dad died. She's got her mommy's teeth. - And she has her uncle's personality! Winning his personality. She's swimmin' now. This last summer, she ended up in the A team. All right. You wanna go out to the lake? Mmhmm. All right, not scared? He used to be afraid to go out in the lake. I wasn't afraid, I was cautious. - No, he was afraid. - I was always cautious. He was afraid. He had the little water wings in the front. When he was 18, he was out there with water wings. - Livin' out here, you know, by myself. Oh, I think it's beautiful. We have pictures. Jason's descriptions of what it was like growing up. Turn on the camera. That's special. 5"“! Happy birthday to you 5"“! 5"“! Happy birthday dear Michelle 5"“! 5"“! Happy birthday to you 5"“! Wait, make a wish. Don't blow yet. Don't tell us what it is. No, don't tell us. I'll get 'em, I'll get em. High five, Michelle, high five! All right. - Oh my god, he has another personality. Jamie, is there another switch? This one doesn't work. No, it's right there. Tell her, Jamie. No, it doesn't work. We must have blown another fuse. - Why don't you fix this damn thing? - Mikey, how much power does that camera draw? I got a battery in it. It doesn't suck up any energy. What happened? I don't know. Did I blow out the lights? - If you have a light on that camera, why don't you turn it on, so we can see? It's not working. There's a flashlight down there. Hold on, hold on. Uh-oh. I got it on now. Whoa, shit. - There should be matches by the fireplace. This light just came on. It doesn't work when you need it to. Can you see that there, Mike? Can you see this, Mike? Can you see this? Here, there's a light right here. I blew too hard. Can you see that? That's it, she blew the lights out. You blew so hard, you blew the lights out. Yep. Happy birthday. This is really dark! Where are you going? - I'm going to light some candles over here. Let me get my jacket. There's a lantern out there. Do you need me to help? - Let's get some light on the subject first. Okay. Let's get the presents. The presents! Hey! It is exciting, no lights. We can just use his camera. Hey, look. My light works. Eric! Oh, now the light works. You sleeping with her? - I don't think that's any of your business. Turn that camera off. Wait, what'd I miss? What'd I miss? Nothin'. The point I wanna make is if you are- If I do, and if I did- I don't need a niece. I don't need a nephew. You don't need a child, you know what I'm saying? There's nothin' wrong. No, man. I use protection. What? If I did, I would use protection. - If you were sleeping, which is just an if- Oh! I have this on film. I can not confirm or deny this with this dick head runnin' his tape. Yeah. Give me the stick. Let's beat him. Hey, hey. Come on, be careful, guys. What? You get this on tape, that'll be good. Mikey gettin' his ass beat. I know. - You tape this one, let me take care of him. - Hold on, I got a flashlight on my, hold on! What? Oh, it's working, forget it. I swear to god, you're gonna break your neck with that thing. - I'm gonna break his neck with that thing. Holy shit. What was it? What the hell was that? Did you see that? What was that? What the hell was that? I don't know. Is the power back on in the house now? It's weird. It was like a- Was it your camera? No, it wasn't my camera. Something flashed through the trees. It went over behind- Is there a helicopter? You know the Johnsons house here right behind the hill? It looked like something went over there. Let's go check it out. Come on. Are you sure, man? I'm gonna save my batteries, and I'm gonna turn this light off. - Save your batteries, yeah, that's it. I don't care what you do. Did you guys see that? You guys didn't see that light? A red light came out behind the Johnsons house over here. We're gonna go check it out. No, we didn't see anything. What happened? I don't know. It was a bright light. What about the fuses? We don't know. It's not working. Running off in the woods- - So, we don't know if the fuses are blown? - What do you need the matches for? You gonna light a fire? Where are you going? We're gonna be right back. We're gonna go see what those lights were. Bye, bye! Michael! We'll be right back. We'll be right back, Michelle. Michelle, hold your pants on, beautiful. - Oh, great, now I can turn this off. - Hey, I want the matches back when you're finished. - I don't have to use this thing. Yes, my dear. Don't set the house on fire. Yes, my dear. - Yeah, yeah, go back in the house. You need to start doing some work around here, man. Watch your hands. What? The back room. That doesn't look too good in the ceiling. What, you don't even know. You're in college. What the hell do you care? Well, it's still my family. I care. You were supposed to paint this last week. She took everything off the walls, and you were supposed to paint it. I'll get to it. Oh, I'm gonna get to it. - That back room's been leaking for how long, Mike? How long? - I'm not sleeping back there, you are. Jesus. Fine, I don't care. I'm gonna be filming it. Mom? Yes? Matches. I'm gonna film the leak. He can't film himself. Hi, my name's dick head. I'm the leak. I'm three years old. It smells so much better out here. Jack offs. Even the water- Shut up! What? Listen to him back there. Here, come on. Walk down these stairs nice and carefully. You don't wanna drop the camera. You almost fell. - Watch out, there's a big step there, Mikey. I don't want you falling on me. - Don't want you falling, and break your leg. Clearly wouldn't want it to be the camera now, would we? Remember falling off? - No, falling off wasn't the question. - We need sticks so we can do the forest thing. - Remember how many times I fell off into that thing? I get pushed off, matter of fact. I didn't push you off. If I pushed you off, you would have been dead. Come on, try to cross this now. Fuck you. God, it's all wet over here. - That's what happens when it rains. - Mike doesn't know about stuff like that. - It was a wet dream I had last night, guys. That's funny. So funny I forgot to laugh. What are you doing back there? You farted. Shit for brains. Oh, Jesus. Don't fart. - You're gonna light that lantern. I'll light it. Shh. - Remember when we used to do that after we had beans? We used to go back and do- Do a flame. We used to go back fart into that- There's probably a plane way up there. It's over there. Where? How do you know? 'Cause I saw it. - Saw it just as much as us, but he knows where it's at. He was pointing the wrong way. I know. - By the time he turned around, it was gone. My camera's starting to work now. We need to fix that roof tomorrow, 'cause I know he'll never get around to it. I'll do it this weekend. I told you I was gonna do it this weekend already. - This is the weekend, this is the weekend. It's not Sunday yet. I told her I'll take care of it. Shit. - If it's like last weekend, it's not gonna get done. It's like sneaking out, remember? I know. Did they build that here? So, did you notice Mom's been drinking? Shit, no shit. Drinking? What are we gonna- Is there any left? You guys don't know. You don't live there. She's been drinking a lot. Mikey, I tried to tell her, you know? What am I gonna do? When I'm there, she doesn't drink. She knows she's not gonna drink when I'm there, but I can't be there- She does it when I do it. She comes home, she takes a little bottle, or whatever she's got- That rum. - She goes back there and drinks. - I'm gonna put some water in it for her before I leave. She watches Johnny Carson. She wasn't like that before. I mean, I know it's hard, you know, dad dying. That's the last thing you need to do is drink. Drinking your problems away is not gonna solve anything. - I'm laying the law, that's all there is to it. I mean, you should. You don't say anything, I know. She doesn't listen to Mike. What am I gonna say? I don't know what to say. Mikey. - Why do you have to go this way through the mud? - Now, we're going back downhill, huh? You got something better? Great, now we're lost. No, man. How do you get lost in these woods? I know these woods- - I know these woods like the back of my hand. Like, whatever side is the back, that's how I know these woods. I don't know. I need a fishing line. There's a fire at the Johnsons. Oh, shit. Move out of the way. Look out, look out, look out. What the hell's that? What the hell is that? Look at it. Goddamn it. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. It's a space ship, Mike. It's a fucking space ship. - Bullshit, it's not a space ship. What is it then? Holy shit, guys. I'm zoomed in, it's a space ship. Holy shit! No way, man. I gotta go see. Holy shit. There's nobody around. There's no one around. Wait up, man. I lost it. Hold on, damn it. They can zap you. How could you lose that thing? Bullshit. - Jerk offs aren't gonna zap you. - How do you know it's not gonna zap you? I lost it. Here it is, here it is. How do you lose it? If there's anybody living there, they heard it for sure. Shit. Turn that fucking light off. Oh, my fucking god. - Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. Get down. Thank god. Dude, this is awesome. This is fucking awesome. Holy shit. You guys, we better get the fuck out of here. No, man. Holy shit. They see us. I think they see us. They're looking at us! Get the fuck out of here! Oh, Shit, fuck! Oh, fuck, what the hell was that? I don't know. Oh, shit. Oh, man. Shit, it looked right at me! It looked right at me! Fuck, oh, shit. Mikey, if you can't run fast, get rid of the fucking camera! Oh, shit! Fuck, what was that? Shit. Oh, shit. We gotta get out of here. They saw us. We have to go. Go, go. Give me the lighter. We have to go. Get rid of the goddamn camera. Shit. Be careful. We're going in the fucking house. We have to get everyone out of here, guys. Eric. Holy shit. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Oh, shit. What are you doing with that gun? Sit down, Renee. Why? What's going on? There was something outside. What? - There's a spaceship or something outside! What? There's a spaceship. Oh, come on. If this is one of those jokes- Shut up, shut up! He's not kidding. There's a spaceship out there or something. We saw some martian or shit or something. Oh, come on. - There was three little guys that came out. Stop doing that funny stuff. Shut up. All of you guys, shut up and listen to me. We gotta go back. Come on, we gotta go. No, no, no. I'm staying here! No, bullshit! We're staying here. We're not going out. - We're protecting my family, and you're part of my family! What are you doing with a gun? Guys, come on! Those fuckers come, and I'm gonna blow their heads off. Get away from the door. Sit down, please. Why, why? Where was all this, Eric? Where did you see 'em? Down the plain over there. Over at the Johnsons! You mean up where the power pole is? That's why the lights are off? Right back there. We followed it, and- You saw a space ship? Right! I saw the lights! Little green men, I guess? Mom, I had it on tape! Check my tape here. There's no power. I have it on tape. I recorded the whole damn thing. We gotta get out of here. The phone's out, Eric. There's no power. We're gonna go down and get 'em then. They saw us. - We're not gonna go down and get 'em! What's with that goddamn gun? Bullshit, we're staying here. Don't aim it. Okay. I'm going We gotta go. No. We're not leaving them here alone, not with them in the woods. You got me? We're stuck in the house then? Yeah, you're listening to me. We're safe here. I don't think we should go outside. I just don't want you out running around the woods with guns. What did you see? A damn space ship. What did it look like? - I don't know, what's a space ship look like? You really did see? Did anybody, did they- Whoa! In the back yard! There's something in the back yard! Oh, shit. We gotta get out of here! You saw it? - There was some flash in the background! Was it the same flash we saw when we went out to check the fuse box? It was the same flash! The red one, the red one. It was right out there! We're going. Mike, which way was it going? I don't know. It looked like it hit up the ceiling or something. - Jason, watch the gun, watch the gun! Geez. Maybe it's gone. Yeah, maybe they left. No way. Oh, shit. Where'd they go? Like it's heading out to sea? Oh, come on. It was heading west. So, way back over the mountains? Way back over the mountains? Okay. You're not going up there again. - We're not going out there, Mom. No way in hell. They're gone. Jason, they're gone. Did you see people out there? Did you see men? We saw three little people. Jason, unload this. Unload yours. No, no. - Please unload the guns and put them in the corner. I just get real nervous with guns in the house. I get real nervous when there's space things outside. Whatever it was, it's gone now. You know, this was gonna be a birthday party for my granddaughter. It still will be. Do you still feel like opening your presents? Jason, why don't you sit? We'll start with the cake, then. - Shorter than you, gray and black, and they saw us. They saw you? Did they follow you? Are you sure it wasn't some kind of animal or something, Jason? It wasn't an animal. - It probably was some kind of animal, I don't know! - Well, just you know, we've gotta stay calm here. We're gonna go eat birthday cake. - Yes, let's go have the birthday party. Let's get the presents, and go to the table. - Come on, Michelle, it's your birthday. What was that thing? As soon as the power goes on, we're gonna take a look at it. I have it on tape. Shit. - Mikey, you had the light on the camera, right? Yeah, but I turned it off. As soon as they looked at us, I turned the thing off. You had the light on. They saw us! I had the lantern on too. I think I turned it off. Shit. - You didn't see them following you back here? We didn't really stop to look. Who knows? Maybe they can fly. - Ma, we really didn't stop to look. - If they could fly, they wouldn't need a spaceship, right? Mom. Well, I say we have birthday cake. I think that's a real good plan. Michelle's about to fall asleep here. She wants to open her presents. Everything's warm in here, man. Not with you in the house, it won't. Let's sit down, Grandma. Grandma? I've lost my coffee cup. Check the kitchen. Just get another one, Mom. No, here it is, I found it. Anybody want any? Eric, you want some coffee? Yeah, please, I need a little bit more. - Mom, is this just coffee in your coffee cup? So good, and so patient. Yeah. It's not very good coffee at that. It's cold right now, but it's coffee. Now, it might be okay. Boy, you got some presents. - She wanted to open her presents, and she didn't. - Well, they're gone now, so let's just- Why don't you start? You wanna start that one? Yeah. Okay- Michael, do you want a piece of cake? Yeah. She's so cute. I'll have a little blue piece. I don't know what it is. Is it a puppy? It's getting so hot. - Jason probably wants all the frosting, right? This is nice wrapping paper. Yeah, I did it myself. - Uncle Jason probably did something himself. - Okay, we're not talking about Uncle Mikey here. Shit. Wow! A teddy bear! - I banged the camera against my head. Thank you. - Lucky that's all that got banged into your head. Who's this from? This is from- I thought you guys must be running out of paper by now. Now, you can draw Renee a picture. Would you? I would really like that. I asked him for one. You gonna have a piece of birthday cake? I don't do pieces. Oh, okay. - You take after your Uncle Jason in your appetite. Yeah. - Yeah, if you'd been gone much longer, we would have finished it all. We hurried back fast as we could. You know, when Mikey was little, he used to play with his food. Now, he just takes pictures of it. - I know, and he's just gonna waste away. He never eats, he just takes pictures. Jesus, get off my back, god. Donald always said that Michael- - You guys have been raking on me all evening. What have you done good this year? No, no, this decade? Excuse me. What's your grades right now, Michael? What? What's your grades right now? I'm making you a picture. Thank you. None of your damn business. I would love that. It is my damn business. It's my business. I'm gonna go draw. Okay, all righty. Be right back. All right. She's a really good artist. What time do you have? I've got 6:15. 6:15. - I got 6:15, and I know it's gotta be later than that, 'cause I didn't get up here from Morton till five. It must need a new battery. My watch is dead. Mine is too. How much is dead? Do you have one? - I do. - Mine is too. I never told time well anyways. I'm serious. My watch isn't working. So, I can't really- Neither is mine. What time do you got? - Maybe you guys didn't wind 'em up. No, it's not that. Mine doesn't wanna, it's not one of those. That's a battery. Who the hell wears a wind up watch anymore? You know, I looked for one, and I couldn't find one. - The don't sell 'em anymore, I don't think. They don't. I went around, I went to the drugstore- - Are you all right? - Yeah. I couldn't find it at all. All right, choke on it. Boy. What's next? Are we gonna go home now? We're gonna have to start heading home. Go draw me another picture. - We coulda had more time to play and open presents if they hadn't wandered off. Okay, we'll start a pile here. Are you all gonna come back for breakfast tomorrow morning? Yeah, we figured that we'd- How did you guys get such a cute kid? I know it's not from the rest of the family. It's gotta be from me. Mikey's promised to fix this- I said I'd get it tomorrow. - You always say you're gonna get it tomorrow. You never get anything goddamn done. Just relax, god. Watch the language. You didn't get birthday spankings yet. - Just as long as the roof gets fixed before winter, that's all I care about, you know. Whoa. Getting heavy. I don't mind- Aw, give my hair petting too? Oh, your do. I messed up your do. - I have all your pictures that you've drawn. They're all over my door, and they're in the bedroom. I have hot and cold running water, and also cold running water down the hall. She tries to take 'em. I have to search her before she leaves. It sort of trickled down, and when it becomes a big rain, it leaks in the back room. So, somebody has to sleep back there. Did you get your stuff together? Drip, drip. She's pretty. Jason, they're trying go. Darling, you can leave some of your presents here, if you want to. She's gonna stay. No, she can't stay here tonight. Are we gonna come back for breakfast? Are you coming back in the morning? - Yeah, I know I can't have you stay, but- What time are we leaving? Whenever. What time do you have to be back Monday? Early? So, you guys gotta get back in the morning? - Yeah, I'd rather get back tomorrow night, but we can leave late. Oh, listen. Do you have any bacon? I'm gonna help you fix the roof, and maybe we'll start painting, 'cause if we get started, maybe you'll finish it, huh? - We got about half a pound. - Okay. - You can paint the wall better than your Uncle Mike. Go give him a big hug and kiss. Hey, Mikey, it won't be a film about Jason and Eric fixing a room. Goodnight! It will be a team effort. Do it, Uncle Michael. Someone wants to kiss you here. Hey! Kinda hard to kiss somebody who's got all that stuff stuck on his face. I'm gonna see you tomorrow morning. Okay, Michelle. All right, bye! - Bye, it was nice seeing you again. Happy birthday. - Bye, Grandma. All right, darlin'. I'm talking about that huge growth hanging off of his face. Bye, sweetie. Bye. Such a big girl. Jamie, it was really nice meeting you. She's growing up. Not such a little girl anymore. Yes, we'll have breakfast. - Maybe you'll get a little baby brother or sister, and then we'll have somebody else to party with, huh? - I'll remember to bring the bacon. Oh, Eric, once you get down the hill- I'll check on the power, Mom. - Yeah, would you call because the phone's out, and let 'em know that we don't have any power up here? No. - Okay, so tomorrow morning, we're gonna fix the roof. You're gonna help. - I already said I was gonna do it, Eric. All right, all right, I'll be there. I'll be there, man. Well, you gotta be there. You live here. You got pictures of that thing? Yeah, I got it all on video. - Why don't you take that tape out, and put a different one in if you're gonna play with it tonight? I want that tape. I'm not, I'm not. I can't put it back in- Tomorrow, after we do the roof, don't say anything, man. - We'll go back to my house without the girls, and we'll check it out. Is that your Grandma? No. Just don't say anything to them, because it's like, I wanna hear if someone else hears about this. Come on, sweetheart. - I can't believe I have it all on video. Are you sure it was working? It was working. I have a little flashing light in here. - You said it was working when I first got here too. I can tell. Bye, everybody! Bye. Give me a hug, dork. You're coming back around. Sounds good. It was nice seeing ya. Okay, good night- - You drive safe going down the mountain. Bye, Michelle. - I'm always careful going down the mountain. You gotta be brave. All right, thanks, guys. - Good night, good night, good night. Drive carefully! - Hey, take care of your momma and daddy. All right, love you. Love you too. Oh, such a sweet girl. Drive careful. Put your seat belts on. Jase. Go make sure the door's locked. - I can't believe I finally have my own. Jason, Jason, where are you going with that? - Ow, what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck? I can't see it. What is this? - What? What is this? Jason, where are you going? Holy shit. That's a picture of one of the things that we saw out there! Oh, no, Michael. What is wrong? Get in the house! What? Just sit down. Jason, Jason, get the brownies. Get the brownies. What is it? That's a picture of one of the things we saw outside the house. Ma] Oh, my god. Where did you see this? There. You saw it through that window? ' Oh, god! There it is! It's in the window right there! Mike, get down! It's gone. Oh, shit! It's trying to get in! Don't shoot, don't shoot! It's just a ricochet, Mikey, go. They must be up on the roof! Oh, my god! Jason, there, the door's locked! I gotta close the window! Get down! The window's open! - Jason, get away from the window. Get away from the door. It's up on the ceiling! Shh, Shh. Shh, Shh. Look, it stopped above you. Shh, Shh. Oh, god, don't! You got it! I think you got it! There's more? You got it. Come on, fuckers. Close the window. Jason, get the window over there. Cover me. This window's gotta be closed. How many are out there? - Get away from the windows, guys. Oh, no. Oh, my god. Where did they come from? Shh. Lock the back door. I locked the door. The door's locked here. Jason, motherfuckers. I told you they weren't gone. I'm gonna grab the truck. Mikey, get your stuff together. What do you want me to do? I want you to help, Mike. Mike, I want you to help Mom however you can. Jason, Jason, come here. You're not going around there. Jason, come here. Eric, you're not going out there. - I need you with the flashlight to cover me while I go get the truck. We're gettin' out of here. No, listen- Now, you're gonna leave everyone? Everybody together, okay? Don't leave, Eric. No way, don't go! Why can't I go with you? Quiet. I want you guys ready. When I drive up there, you guys are gonna jump in, okay? - Get your lighters, get your coloring crayons. Jason. We'll be right back. Just lock the door behind me. I'll knock twice if it's me. Don't go out there. Just keep your ass in. Jesus. What do we do? Just be ready, man. Go that way, go in the truck. Watch out. All right, it's clear. Run for it. Holy fuck! What, what, what? Oh, shit, watch out. Eric, over there! Shoot it! Eric, Eric! Oh, shit. Shoot the motherfucker. Watch out! Shit. That's one of them! Watch out! Oh, shit, get the fuck out of here! Get that camera out of here! He shot one of 'em! He shot one of 'em, he's got 'em. What? He shot one of 'em dead. It's right outside there. Oh, no. I don't believe this. Now he shot it? Mike, is it dead? Oh, shit. I don't even know. I think it's dead. It's not moving. He caught the motherfucker. What? Mom, he shot it! It's dead. He shot the one off the roof. Yeah, it's dead. You guys okay? Eric? - This was supposed to be a really fun day. We're gonna get out of here. Eric! Jason! You guys okay? Put it in the truck. Where are you going? Jason, oh, shit! Hey. Hey, he's bringing it in. You guys better close your eyes. Get away. Don't bring that thing in here! What are you doing? Put it in the back room! Why? - Mom, bring everyone in the back room. - Why would you bring that thing in? No, don't bring that in! Oh, shit! What are you doing, Eric? Don't bring it! Give me my gun. I gotta shoot it again. It's already dead. Fuck. Shoot it. Get out! Get out of here, Mike! Get that thing out of here! I'm going, I'm going- Why did you bring that in here? That's just stupid. Oh, shit. That door doesn't lock back there. Why did you bring it in here? I told you to put it in the truck! Yeah- Renee, shut up for a minute! That thing is dead out there. Those little guys can get him from wherever they died. What are they gonna think about him killing their buddy? You want 'em coming back here knowing that? They gotta come through the house to find him, okay? - Now, they gotta come through the house to find him! - We got five more minutes to get on the road, and get the hell out of here! Well, then, let's go! Shut up! Right now, let's go! Mom, we're going. Come out here and fuck with me. Get your coat, get your coat, baby. Come on. Hold on to her. It's okay, Michelle. - Great, now will you put away your guns? I'm sorry about your- Take me with you. I want a flashlight. Do we have a flashlight here? Get that fucking thing out of my face! Put the camera down, Mike! It's down already. Just stand right here. We'll be right back. Hand me the flashlight. No, let's go now. We're all going together. Wait a minute, you dumb shit. What are you doing? Come back here! - Don't go off, and leave us staying here! Can you guard someone? I'm gonna be here. Can you guard someone? Yes! I'm gonna be here! Everybody, shut up! I'm in charge of this family now, okay? Mom, I'm gonna go get the truck. I'm bringing it over here with the motor runnin'. I don't want us out there trying to get that goddamn thing started, okay? Honk the horn. We'll be ready to go. Do you need something? Grab a lantern, grab something. Take charge, Mom. You got a flashlight? I got a flashlight. We're gonna leave the candles burning. We're just gonna leave the house as it is. - We're sure our flashlight will be enough? Don't you think you should have a heavy coat? He wouldn't wear a coat. I know how he is. - They shouldn't have gone out and left us. We should have all gone out there. Mom, we have to stay there. Eric knows what he's doing. Well, we can run to the truck as fast as he can drive it back down here. - Mom, if there's more of those things out there, we don't need to have Michelle get kidnapped or something. Okay, okay, okay. We're fine. They're gonna get the truck. When they're back, we'll just get in the truck, and we'll be fine. Mom, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine. They're gonna get the truck, and we're gonna get the hell outta here. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Renee, you okay? Renee? You okay? I don't hear the truck. Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you parked, Jamie? Are you just down the road here? Down the road about 200 yards. The mud was so heavy. He brought it up earlier. It's not that far away. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. Get the truck. Let me look out. - What are we gonna do when we get the truck? - We're gonna go to our house, baby, in town. We can get then police. I wanna get out of here. That thing's in the back room. We've gotta get out of here. Mom, it's gonna be fine. Eric knows what he's doing. He shouldn't have shot it. - Mom, they were gonna come down. Ma, they didn't- - They were trying to get in here. They were trying to get through the damn chimney. You need to help me with Michelle now. Yeah, okay. You're better off than I am. You're better off than anybody here. You're just oh, well, it's something different. - Jason, Jamie, ask him if he has his wallet. I don't think he has his wallet. We should probably grab that. Jason? Did he take his car keys with him? Jason? Can you talk to us? We're getting a little nervous. Wait. Excuse me, Michelle. Jason? Jase? Jason? Will you all please stand back? Jason! Don't open the door! Jamie, don't open the door. Jamie, just knock. Jamie- Jason? I don't see him out here. Come on, Jamie. I'm just gonna open it a crack. I don't see anybody out there. I don't hear the truck, I don't see the lights. Where are they? Jason? I'm scared. Oh, don't be scared, Michelle. Jason, where are you? Oh, shit. It's Jason's gun! ' Jason? Oh, shit. Jason! - Stay here, everyone, stay here! Jason? Stay here! Eric? Jamie! Jamie, stay here. Jamie! Jamie, Mom! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie, come on! Eric, where are you? Jamie, come on. Let's go back inside. Please answer! Hold on, hold on. Mom, bring her back inside. Please, please, Jamie! Jamie! - Jamie, we have to go back to the house. Come on. Oh, my god! - Mom, would you get Jamie out of here? Look at her! Jamie, come on! Come on, come on. Oh, shit. Jamie, Jamie, come on. Let's go. We gotta go back to the house. We cannot stay out here. Mom, bring her back inside. No, no, no. Jamie, please. Jamie, come on. We have to go back! They might be out here. Jamie, they're okay. Oh, god. It's okay. No, no, no. We need to go look for him. You wanna stay here? You stay here, and I'll look- No, Jamie! Mom, keep her. Jamie, you have to stay in the house. All right. Did you lock that door? I locked it! Nobody goes out, do you hear me? Jamie, it's okay. They're okay. Jamie- It's all right. They've gone for help, I know they have. They got away. The truck's broken. It won't run, and they ran for help. Jamie, they got away. They'll be back. Jamie, it's okay. Now, listen. I'm sure they got away. They grew up on this mountain. They know this mountain like the back of their hands. They can run down it in the dark with their hands tied behind 'em. They'll go down, and try to find, you know, try to find help. The Harrisons are gone this winter. Who lives by? Well, I don't know when they'll be back. It might take 'em you know, 30 minutes, it might take 'em an hour. Depends on how far they- - It's gonna take them about 40 minutes, Mom. 40 minutes? Yeah. We have to go back to the kitchen. Now, listen. Everybody stays in the house, okay? Nobody goes out. We don't open the door. As long as we're in here, we're safe. They can't get in. - Mom, I think we should get away from this door. It's making me nervous. Okay. I don't wanna go towards the back. God. Come on, Jamie. Let's go in the kitchen. We'll go in the kitchen. Come on. I'm so hot. It's so hot in there. Oh, it's so hot. It's okay, Jamie. Why can't we go to the Johnsons? We have to stay here. Jamie, they had to take off. They probably saw 'em, and took off. They'll be back. I know they'll be back, so all we have to do is just sit here and wait. We have to just sit here, and be calm. - Right, and we're going to do something to keep busy. We're gonna- Until they come back. They'll be back. We have to sing, or dance, or play the piano, or tell stories, but no ghost stories, okay? Michelle, you okay? Sweetie. Oh, god. Jamie, it's okay. I mean, they- - Mom, I'm sure they're gonna be fine. - Why don't we play cards like you said? You wanna play cards? Yeah. Okay. - Do you know where the cards are? I know they'll be back. Yes, I know they'll be back. They'll come back, and they'll bring help. They'll go get the sheriff. You know, somebody may have already reported it. The power's out, the phone's out, the lights are out. The power people may be there any time. All we have to do is wait. Maybe everybody just got out. - All we have to do is wait, that's the hard part. Well. Maybe you're right. This is one thing women know how to do. We know how to wait. We spent our whole lives waiting. Wait for a boy to call, you know? Wait for one to ask you to marry him, and then you wait for the husband to come home. You forgot one. - Well, you weren't supposed to see that one. Wait for the baby to be born. I need some water. We can't open the window. What are we gonna play, Michelle? What card game do you play? - Does everybody know how to play Go Fish? I think so. - Renee, do you know how to play Go Fish? I'm not sure if I remember. Can you tell me? All right. Well, you can learn on the way. Five, five, five, six, six, six, seven, seven, seven. Then, you put these out like that? That's Go Fishing. Okay. God, I hate waiting. I was never very good at it. How many cards do you need? Three of a kind, and then, you know- To make a pair. No, three of a kind, not a pair. You have to have three, don't you? Three to have a match. - You ask a person, you say do you have any sixes, or do you have any eights? No cheating. If you have one, you've gotta give it. If you get the card you want, then you get another turn. If they say Go Fish, and you draw it, then you get another turn. I gotta take my sweater off. I'm about to die. Jamie, it's gonna be okay. Yeah, Jamie, come on. Come on, we're gonna play cards. This is a really crummy hand. You can help me. You get to go first, so. Okay, Michelle, do you have any twos? Go Fish. - Now, Michelle, it's your, oh, did you get that? Did you draw two? Yeah, I did. Way to go! - How long did you say it would take them? - Well, the Harrisons are not home this weekend, and Susan and Steven live just below them, and I think he was gonna go fishing this weekend. So, if he did, she went to town to stay with her sister. She always does, 'cause she doesn't like to stay out by herself. So, that's- - Jamie, they're gonna be all right. That's two houses down the mountain, but if they had to go through them, they wouldn't have gone down by the road, I don't think. They would have cut through the ravine. Don't you think, Michael? Yeah, hell yes. They would have cut through the ravine. - They had a flashlight with them, didn't they? - They had two flashlights with them. Yeah, they had their flashlights, and they weren't out there. So, they took off with the lights. - Yeah, flashlights, flashlights weren't there. Right, they took 'em with 'em. Flashlights weren't there. Yes, they're okay. It's your turn, baby Michelle. What do you want? Mom, do you have any kings? Mom hasn't even looked at her hand yet. She doesn't even know what game we're playing. She's got a seven, though. Do you have a king? No kings, sweetie. Go Fish, Go Fish. No flashlights, no kings. - You didn't get it, so it's Momma's turn now. I have twos. Oh, god, it is warm in here. Okay, Mom. What do you want? Hey, Renee? Renee, where are you going? Renee, come back here! Renee! Don't open the door! Don't go out there! Renee, Renee! Don't open the door. No, no, come back. Renee! Renee, what's the matter? What's wrong with her? Look at her! - Mom, what's the matter with her? Renee, come back. You don't have to let them in. Come back! Don't open the door. Renee? Mom, what's the matter with her? I don't know, I don't know. Her eyes were just like- - It's like she was drunk or something. - Ma, Ma, water, some water, something. It's so hot. It's gotta be the heat's getting to her. - Jamie, let's get away from the door. Come on, come on. Renee, are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Oh, god. Jesus Christ. What happened? I don't know. I just got dizzy. Oh, lord. Thank you. Are you okay? Renee, are you okay? What happened to her? You got up and went to the door. It was like you were asleep, like you were sleepwalking. You just got up, walked over, and tried to go out the front door. I don't even- You don't? I don't remember. I don't really remember how I got from here to there. Oh, shit. Well, come on. We have to concentrate on the card game, okay? It's just so hot in here. Yeah, it is. Mom, she's freaking out. We can't open a window. Jamie, what cards do you want? Oh, god. You got any queens? Me? No queens, Go Fish. Geez. No queens? All right. Renee, do you have any fives? Jesus. Michelle, do you have any fours? Go Fish. It's your turn. Jamie, do you have any sixes? Go Fish. Excuse me. Your turn, Michelle. Mom, do you have any jacks? Ma? What, what, what? Mom? Ah, Shit! No, no! What the hell's going on here? No, Ma, you told me yourself- Mom, let go of the door! Grandma! Didn't you hear him? Mom, what's the matter? He said open the door. Mom, get away from the door! They said go open the door! I didn't hear anything. What, what, what? Did you hear? Jamie, get away from the door! It said open the door. Jamie, get away from the door. Come on, Mom. Let's go away from the door. It's not Jason, it's not Jason. Let's get away from the door. Goddamn it, let's go! Come on, you're scaring me! - That's what they said, open the door. Jamie, bring her back. Go open the door. It was like it repeated over and over again. Who repeated, who repeated? In your head. Who repeated? God. It kept saying open the door. I didn't hear anything. - I heard, it was like it was inside my head. - I'm turning on the fucking radio. Open the door, open the door. That's what it was. It wasn't scary, though. It was like, open the door and let us in, and everything will be all right. What did it sound like? You didn't really hear it out loud. - I didn't even think about it until you said it. It was like it was in your mind. Oh, we have to sing, huh? I wanna sing. Michael, please turn that off, Michael. No, if we had the radio on, we can't hear 'em then. - Okay, nobody gets up from the table, all right? We'll turn it down. We have to keep it up! - You've got to put the camera down, Michael. This is, you know- All right, I'm sorry. All right, all right. Far enough. Enough is enough, Michael. - You have to have two cards like this. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! What, Michael, what? The alien's gone! The alien's gone, it's not back there anymore. It's gone. How'd it get out? I don't know! It's not there anymore, Mom! It's loose in the house? No, get away from there! Oh, don't go back there. Lock the door! Are you sure it's not back there? It's not back there. I just took a look in there. How'd it get out? I don't know! Is the window open? Is the door open or the window? I don't know, I didn't look. Oh, well, great. What are we gonna do? Great, great, great. - It's loose in the house, in the bathroom. Shit! Mom, get back here! Shit! Give me a poker. Give me something here. Yeah, or a baseball bat. Here, no, Mom, I'm going! Oh, my god, Be careful. Be careful, Michael. - Mom, bring the others back through the kitchen. Everybody, stay in the kitchen. Oh, Jesus, not in the bathroom. Oh, it's not in here. Are you sure it's gone? It couldn't get out. Stay back with that one. - Oh, shit, the back door's open. It opened a window? It must have still been alive. - Are you sure it's not in the house? It's not in the house. It's not in the bathroom. They came and got it. It must have been really dizzy. Okay, everybody, back to the kitchen. I got the back door locked. Okay, we gotta stay back in here. Oh, no. What the hell was that? Oh, dear. They're trying to get in. Jamie, get away from the door! No, Jamie! Mom! They could be out there trying to get back in here with us. Oh, god, they're out there. They're there! Get down! Eric? No, no, no. Eric, is it you out there? Jamie, keep her back! Come on. Stay in here. Jamie, don't! It's okay. Michael, put that goddamn camera down! I will! - I'm gonna wrap it around your neck if you don't! All right, all right, Mom. If it's them, Eric! Jason! Eric! We're not gonna open the door. We're not going to open the door. Please, everybody back to the table, okay? Who wants a drink? Who wants a drink? It's time to bring out the drinks. What's happening? I'm gonna close the windows. I'm gonna double bolt to make sure they're locked. Can't we turn it off? Maybe it'll keep the voices down. It'll keep the voices out of our head. We have to think about something else. We have to. They're all locked. - We'll get up, and find everybody that's gone. Jason will come back, and then we'll fix the roof. The roof is really gonna be here for Christmas. We'll go to the beach. We can have some more cake. I'm full. I've had enough cake too. I'd die if I had another forkful. - If anybody gets sleepy, we can sleep in here, but nobody goes in the back bedroom. - I don't think we'll getting to sleep in here. Anything, anything, anything. - One thing I want everybody to do is check your hands. Michael, you playing? Yeah, I'll play. You're playing? Okay, all right. We can cheat this time. Michael's playing.
