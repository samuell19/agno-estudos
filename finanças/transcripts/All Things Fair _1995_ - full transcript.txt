ALL THINGS FAIR "On Mating" Lectures on Sexuality By Carolus Linneus Discharge of semen ... generally begins by the 14th year, when men first indulge ... in the act of love, and continues thereafter ... until the age of 50 or 60, when it comes to an end. And when the semen starts to flow, hair around the pleasurable members also begins to grow, the breasts begin to swell, the voice changes, et cetera. Both sexes are stirred by nature towards mating ... more easily than before, when they scarcely noticed ... the differences between them." - It's time. - You sure ? - Yes. - Really sure ? - Yes. - False claims will be punished. I don't care. Three-quarters of an inch ? Let's verify. Now you'll see. - We've got time. - No, we don't. We can't rush this. Postponed until next recess. It's postponed until next recess. - What did you say his name was ? - Stig. He's cute. - He lives in your building ? - Yes, same floor. Mikael Bengtsson. Orvar Bergmark. - Grunt-Orvar. - Excuse me ? Grunt-Orvar. It has to be Runt-Orvar to be funny. Isidor Blecker. How long did he say it was ? Kaj Cervin. How long did he say it was ? Bengt Dahlstrom. How long is it ? Roger Hansson. Krister Kristenson. Bo Larsson. Lars Larsson. Sune Malmberg. Sture Martensson. Albert Nilsson. I was class monitor last term. Can I be monitor again ? Certainly. You and I can keep order in the class together. That would be nice. Helge Persson. Stig Santesson. - The Stockholmer. - The Stockholmer ? Are you from Stockholm ? Yes. I left two years ago. Me too. I just left three days ago. My name is Viola j-son Gruter. I'll write it on the blackboard. Some ladies piss themselves when they come. What did you say ? They piss when they come. Why ? It's, like, wide open inside. Wide open, like a door. Maybe they just forgot to go to the bathroom first. Don't you understand anything ? The dick is still inside. Maybe it's when they come really big. Probably. I hope we'll get along well ... this spring term. - You just staying one term, miss ? - We'll see. Take out your books. - Prove it, Izzy. - Use the tape measure. It has to be three-quarters of an inch. - Is it stuck ? - We don't have all day. Definitely passes. - Three-quarters ? - Yeah, he's right. Out with the cash. - How much is it ? - Twenty-eight times 25 ore. Stop. - That's cheating. - Cheating ? - Yes, he's a jew. - So what ? - It doesn't count. - Doesn't count ? No, they have a lot more hair than us. Thicker, too. It's cheating. I didn't cheat. See for yourself. It's hair. What the hell else could it be ? Sure it's hair. That's not what I'm saying. - Then what ? - You're a jew. Christ, sure I'm a jew. So what ? Didn't you hear what they said ? It doesn't count. You've got more hair than we do, and thicker, too. He'd be disqualified at the racetrack ... If he were a horse. You didn't say anything before. - But that's how it is now. - You can see that. It's obvious. Wait, Izzy. You get the 25 ore back. What fucking 25 ore ? His stake. If he can't compete, he has to get his stake back. Why ? He knew it from the start. What did he know ? That he's a jew. Look in the mirror. His beak takes up the whole mirror. But this time we'll let him off. Give him his 25 ore. And you should be damn grateful. "He came like a storm on an April evening, and had a tankard on a belt round his neck." Do you know who this was ? - His name begins with a C. - Time's up. Five minutes. She looked. I've got three left. Hell no. One at the most. We meet him at the beginning of the novel. He is the storm. Are you asleep ? This place is thick with flies. His name is Carlsson. We'll look at the excerpt once more. Left. Thank you, class. Sit down. Your name is Stig ? The fact I haven't yelled at you, may lead you all to think I didn't notice ... your little eccentricities. Nothing could be further from the truth. Sharing the same piece of chewing gum isn't good. It promotes infectious diseases. Then there's the note you passed around. However, I may allow you to continue with your little specialty. I've never considered the Fly to be a useful animal. I don't know how many you've killed, but I'm very impressed with your accuracy. I think you missed one. Two. One behind the widow's son in the picture, and another that ... You will stay and clean up the execution grounds. How ? Is water all right, or should I use soap too ? Use your imagination. And the note. What note ? The note you passed around that interrupted the lesson. I don't know where it is. Your right back pocket. Would you please read it ? Well ? I'm all ears. I can't do that, miss. Are we suddenly no longer able to read ? No ... but I can't do it, miss. "How many times does a cock go in and out during normal sex ? Right answer wins a prize." You gentlemen have ... a rather exaggerated idea of male potency. All these answers, except perhaps Olle's, are the result of wishful thinking. The flies. What ? That one, for instance. All corpses removed, miss. And that one ? Good-bye. Good evening. Sigge !. SEYMOR SANTESSON Sigge !. Don't hang your hat on the moose. You know what Dad says. Where is Sigge ? First I heard he had a quick leave. Then Kalle came and said : it was postponed indefinitely. And I made brown beans. Was there a letter ? Kalle brought it. It's under the mermaid. The little mermaid. Don't waste the batteries, Mom. Special news report. German forces west of Stalingrad ... have suffered severe losses, and the area around ... He lost a couple of pounds, but he's still too fat for welter weight. - You are going to a party ? - Why do you ask ? The curlers. No, I just felt ... I want to look nice for Sigge. Too fat by how much ? Four. Pounds or tons ? Tons. The limit is 148. If the fight were tomorrow, he'd fight Carlstrom. - Is that Mighty Arvid ? - Yes. Toughest guy in the army. In otherwords : Every mouthful is a safety hazard. "Transfer to submarine service unconfirmed." Unconfirmed. Submarine ? He can't even ride in an elevator without panicking. I'm just going up to the attic. I'm sort of in a hurry. You're going to the movies. It's my job. I'm late. Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes. - Come, let's go. - Let's take the tables. Leave them. The Nordic Museum needs some things. Guys, let's help her out ! You know this one ? Music, music, music We all need it sometimes ... Technical difficulties. You can buy chocolate while you wait. We don't want chocolate. We want to see the film. It started five minutes late to begin with. Then it breaks down when it's barely started. - What the hell kind of theater is this ? - And it's not the first time. Chocolate, anyone ? I want some chocolate. You and your damn sweet tooth ! Don't buy anything. It'll delay things more. You buying the whole box ? Hurry up, for God's sake. - Anyone else ? - No. Start the movie. OUR GANG Damn it. That's the last time I help you. You have to learn to be on time. - If Pettersson had shown up ... - I'd have sold my last coconut ball. Damn it, I don'twant to lose my job just because ... And put your hat on. If Pettersson sees you with no hat on, you'll be seeing stars. Good boy. Then they have "ori-gies." - "Ori-gies." - I heard you. What's that ? When a bunch of people do it together. When a bunch of people do it together, I said. Is that the same as group sex ? What's group sex ? Same as you said. What was it ? "Ori-gies." - "Ori-gies." - Quiet, damn it ! He's good around the house too. Congratulations. Yeah, he always takes out the garbage. What about the rugs ? What ? Does he help with the rugs too ? Always. You sit in the window a lot. God, you know what we forgot ? Language lessons on the radio. Aasen ... That's him. Norway. There are a few of us here around the microphone ... in a small room. and there are thousands and thousands ... throughout Scandinavia listening to us. There are thousands and thousands ... in the whole of Scandinavia listening to us. And we're here ... And you are listening to us in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and other places. And you who are here and you are listening to us ... in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and other places. What do you think ? You're improving. You can pull it off. - Sigge. - Hi. - How long are you staying ? - just until tomorrow. You didn't buy a ticket, did you ? No, the girl in the box office likes the navy. - She's Danish, right ? - Yeah. Are you on submarines, or is that a secret ? No, I didn't pass the test, but I can take it again. I am going under water. Imagine ! Just a thin steel skin between you and the icy green water. Cheek to cheek with death. Can you think of anything nicer ? No, it sounds great. As long as you don't have claustrophobia. - Claustro ... ? - Phobia. Fear of elevators. I'm not scared of elevators, am I ? I've never seen you in one. I take elevators. You always take the stairs. And there are no stairs in submarines. There she is. That's her. If you stay until after the 9:00 show, we can go home together. Sure. - Is Dad home ? - Was my hat hanging on the moose ? No ? Well, then. Good point. Help me. When will you learn to undress yourself ? I didn't tell anyone you were home. They'll really be surprised in the morning. What are you doing ? The blackout. You should know about that. - When are the finals ? - They never tell you anything. Not until the last second. As long as they don't cheat me out of fighting Mighty Arvid. I'd like to get revenge on him. But it depends on whether he'll be transferred. Of course, they can't transfer people just for the army boxing championship. Now I really feel like I'm home. What did you think of Lone ? What did you talk about ? She talked a hell of a lot. Usually Danish isn't so hard. I didn't understand a word she said. Some dialect, north jutland or something. Sigge ? What if she said she had syphilis ? I'm just looking up a word. I do it a lot. Or I used to, when Mr. Mollerstrom was here. What word ? All the words I don't understand. We just have a small dictionary at home. Not many words in it. I understand. What's the word ? Right now ? You mean now, miss ? Mediocre. Of moderate ability. Now you don't have to look it up. Thank you. Any others ? No. I just wanted to see if it says anything else. Well ? What does it say ? "Mediocre. Latin mediocris. Middling. Mediocrity. Mediocre : person of moderate ability. Work of no particular value." I didn't know the noun was mediocrity. We learn something new every day, it would seem. Good-bye. When does it have to be back ? By 5:00. He's going fishing this evening. How is your turtle today ? Thanks for asking. What is it, Albert ? I don't know if you can stay. I can't assume responsibility. Don't worry. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. What's he doing ? Looking up a word. What's Sticko doing ? What the hell are you doing ? Since Albert hasn't returned from the nurse, I need someone else to go with me ... up to the map room. I'll help you. That was the math teacher. What number was it ? Sixty-two. It wasn't rubella. Good. Sit down. Stig better take that back. He's probably the only one who knows where it goes. Miss, the monitor's job is to take them back and forth. I only had to see the nurse due to force majeure. Yes, indeed. Do you see anything ? No. Sit down. It's not the first airplane to fly over. But it's a Flying Fortress. You can tell by the sound. Take your seats. Plexiglas incoming. How many are there ? Five. You can carve Plexiglas with a knife. - An ordinary knife ? - Yes. Any bullet holes ? Aren't there some in the tail fin ? - What's wrong ? - What ? - You look sick. - No, I'm not sick. Maybe I am after all. Yes. Let me feel. I'd better go home to bed. Christ, that's my bike ! You'll get it back tomorrow. Have I done something wrong ? No, you haven't. Once again : Don't come by unannounced. My husband may be home. You said he has a car. I'll see it if it's here. What make is it ? American. It has a deer on the front. - A Dodge. - Yes, that's it. - Color ? - Blue. A shade darker than your eyes. He usually parks it in the garage in the yard. - Then I just have to look there. - No, it's not that simple. Sometimes he parks it on the street. Which one ? There are four of them. Check all four, for Christ's sake. A tip : At home he mostly sits in the kitchen, listening to music. Classical. If you hear Beethoven, it's streng verboten. For safety's sake, always use the kitchen stairs. I never listen to music. I'm tone-deaf. But certain signals reach me all the same. What subject ? What are you getting tutored in ? English. I should ... We drank some juice. Or rather, I drank some juice, and my teacher drank ... coffee. I was just drying the glasses. I have to go to work. Listen to this. What ? What ? Aunt Bertha broke her leg. Serves her right. Go easy on the students you're tutoring. The one just now was a nervous wreck. First one in bed gets the bottom. Come. Come. Don't be afraid. Miss, did you see what the Stockholmer did ? - What ? - Did you see what he did ? No. When I took down the map and was going to ... He pushed me against the wall and ran off with the map. We'll address that later. Where did I buy it ? I bought it in London. I just managed to buy a wardrobe before it was too late. That was the last time my father traveled. He sat in his chair, and the cars just had to wait while we rolled across Bond Street. The Rolls and the Bentleys. Daddy smiled once. Just once. And then the war came. Don't talk about Daddy. Not about Daddy. You're the one talking about your father. I didn't say anything. It's a bad habit I have during intimate moments. Tell me about your father. I want to know all about you. What does he do ? He hunts moose. He's a moose hunter. A seasonal worker ? That's just in the autumn. That's why we're so poor. No, he's a private chauffeur, for executives and such. He did shoot a moose once, but he called it "downing" it. He drove a few aristocrats to their hunting grounds. Then they sat him on a stool and put a gun in his hands. Not shot. "Downed." It's on our wall at home. It takes up half our apartment, and ours is smaller than yours. We have to duck every time we pass by it. Where is your hat ? - Can't I work without it ? - With no hat ? Are you crazy ? It's to keep your hair in place. Go in and sell, for God's sake. But nobody wants any. Go in. Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes. Nobody wants any. Start the movie. Keep moving and punching, okay ? Three minutes to go. Seconds, leave the ring. Last round. Go get him. Round three. Get up ! Sigge, get up ! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ! Sigge ! Sigge ! Stop. I'm first. Anyway, elders come first. Will we make it ? We'll begin with the airraidalarm, which sounds like this. Are you sure that's the Stockholm accent ? Viola. Viola ? Happy birthday. I didn't go to Nassjo. Viola ! Well, hello. Where's the wife ? Did she go on an errand ? Yes. Are you behind in English again ? Avase. just perfect. Tchaikovsky. Romeo andJuliet. The girl on the balcony. Yeah, I know. Straight gin. Not bad. But you should see the plans I drew for my real innovations. This is ... This is just small potatoes. A bit of hocus-pocus for the customers, you know. But not without a certain stimulating effect on sales. You know ... You know, you think of a lot of things ... when you sit behind the wheel. And you know, the roads around Goinge ... are straight and boring. You have lots of time. Lots of time to think up there among those spruce trees. It's not complicated. You just regulate the flow ... with a little bolt in the back. And then ... If you're away, or made some unwise New Year's resolutions, you can just stop the flow with the same gadget, the same gadget you turn it on with on january 2nd. Understand ? Easy as pie, you know. This is just peanuts. I mean,just a little gimmick for customers, but it makes an impression. And that's what counts in my business : making an impression. Take my name. What do you think my name is ? Not the name on my sign. That's K. Kjell. Kjell is no good. Boring. Christ, no. Only the pastor and that sign refer to me as Kjell. My real name : Frank. Frank to my customers. They think of Sinatra, and I'm halfway there. Everybody likes Sinatra, right ? Although I prefer Mahler myself. Musically, I mean. And Beethoven, Iate Beethoven. String quartets, "Grosse Fuge." Food for the soul. Cheers. To Beethoven. Frank. - And your name is ? - Stig. Stig. Me Frank, you Stig. "Sleep on. Kjell is at Kolmarden. V '." Good morning, Albert. Is anyone absent today besides Stig ? Is Stig absent ? I didn't know that. Yes, I met his mother on the tram. Hi. We have to hurry. Breakfast breakwill be over soon. - Are you finished ? - Yes. It's coming soon. It swells. Swells ! Do you want something to drink ? - Sure. - juice ? Yes, please. Think of what we talked about. Stockings made of nylon. - Nylon stockings. - Thanks. That's what Yank parachutes are made of. Jesus ! It's like sandpaper on the thighs. Women aren't that dumb. Think about it. Where do wool stockings come from ? The ones that warm ladies' legs in winter ? They come from curly little lambs who give wool and say baa. And shoes ? Where do they come from ? - From cows. - Yes. That's it. Cows with milk in their bellies and leather on their backs, and who say moo. And let's not forget the hardworking little silkworm. The slant-eyed workhorse from China. A silent character, certainly, but it works and struggles ... by the sweat of its brow. Not to mention cotton, which grows in the fields of Alabama and waves in the wind. What do all these materials have in common ? They come from ? From ? From abroad. We have lambs and cows in Sweden. For God's sake, Stig. No. They come from ? - From nature ? - Of course. They move. They move and make noises. Well, not all of them, but most of them. They run and playwhen young. Silkworms don't run. They lie in a cocoon when they're young. Well, yeah. But the rest-wool, leather. They run around and dance and play when they're young. And where does nylon come from ? Greasy machines in the Pentagon. Besides, it's a dumb product. Nylon has no voice. It's not just unnatural, it's ... an abomination. A monstrosity. Worse than that. It's ... it's ... - An anomaly. - Exactly. Exactly. That's what it is. It's an ... - Anomaly. - That's what it is. That's it. To wool ! Aren't you going to the movies tonight ? What's playing ? They Died With Their Boots On. Flynn. - Cheers. - To wool. Dad's home. Your hat. You bought a phonograph record ? Wait, listen. Was it expensive ? Stig bought a phonograph record. It's Sigge's phonograph. He can't use it. But Sigge's at sea, Seymor. I'll listen later. Let that cat out ! Let that cat out ! Did you hear me ? Jesus Christ ! What are you doing ? You old bastard ! What did you call me ? Old bastard ! Are you deaf ? - Stop it, boys ! - jesus Christ ! What does the stocking say ? No explanation necessary. Unless you insist. Sit down. Sit down ! Shall we discuss this in Swedish ... or English ? You must speak it perfectly by now. "Explanation ?" ... the young man asks. How can the husband keep so calm ? There are certain things ... that shouldn't be in a certain place ... at a certain time. A lady's garter, for example. And violet, of all things. Where should it not be ... when the old salesman comes home after a week on the road ? In the backseat of his car. If it happens to be there, who should definitely not find it ? His wife, of course. Wrong article, wrong place, wrong finder, wrong time. But ... He sells ladies' underwear. Couldn't the garter have come from his sample collection ? No. No, it couldn't. It was, in fact, a used garter. What an idiot ! That garter ... cost me a son. Nothing could repair that. One week after the wedding. And violet, mind you. The color of sin. Of course, booze was to blame. Of course. You don't know what you're doing, did or should do. The taste is to blame. It just tastes too good. MI LITARY LETTER "Sticko. How are you ? I'm fine. There's a new match next Thursday." It's the same ... It's the same language. I can't make sense of it. I can't make sense of it. I can't make sense of it. I can't make sense of it. I can't make sense of it. Rules for going on the wagon : Avoid dining rooms. Hotel dining rooms are the villain in the drama. You have to sleep, so you have to check into a hotel, but avoid dining rooms. Just imagine. Lilly's Farewell, played by some dusty dining room trio, when you're sitting there hungering for Mahler. Then it's tempting ... to order two lagers and a stout to wash down the misery. And they have dandruff on their collars too, all three of them. There they are. Emil, Emil ! Once more. Shoot, Emil ! Now we'll have a toast. Cheers, and welcome. Very good. Stina, more presents. There's no name on this one. Have I got an unknown admirer here ? You'd better watch out, Seymor. - What will you use that for ? - I have no idea. What's so funny about the duck ? A family secret. Curt, play another piece. Yes, do that. Come. I want to show you something. What ? - What did you want to show me ? - You'll see. Stand there. Close your eyes. Don't look until I tell you. Now you can look. Do what you want with me. Don't be shy. This is what a woman looks like. I've thought of everything. I locked the door. Anyway, the others won't come in for a while. You saw yourself how many cookies were left. You don't have to worry about me getting pregnant. Look. It tells on the package how to use them. I've thought of everything. In case there's a lot of blood. If I could just explain ... If I could explain, Lisbeth. You don't have to explain. Just go back outside. If your mom asks about me, say I ate too much cake. There you are. Listen, I found that quotation. - I want to listen to this now. - just turn it down a bit. No, I want it like that. Why are you with Frank ? Why did you get married ? He's my hostage. Frank is a hostage I took once. You should have seen all the gentlemen who courted me back then. They would always think before opening their mouths. As a result, their mouths most often remained shut. They were "courting cavaliers." Well-tailored types with nothing inside. And so I called them ... "scoundrel suitors." Scoundrels just after my father's money. When Frank came along, you should have seen my aunts' faces. He brought fresh air into the parlor, and they couldn't stand that. But I got air, and I began to breathe. But that air is used up now. Shouldn't you let your hostage go ? Why don't you divorce him ? He has to have someone to come home to, even if I'm not here. You've seen it yourself. Otherwise he'll go under. Are you sure of that ? I know where to buy cheap condoms. Really ? If you buy 500, you get them for half price. What the hell are you going to do with 500 condoms ? You have no use for even one. Advance planning. Like, if you fuck three times a day, you'll use them up in less than six months. But you don't fuck three times a day. Only rabbits do, and they don't need condoms. No one's forcing you to buy them. - You're supposed to be on the wagon. - I know. But there are reasons. You've come to a house of mourning. There should be spruce twigs on the doorstep. The phonograph is playing the appropriate music. "Kindertottenlieder." Mahler. NYLON HYSTERIA I N AMERICA Toten. What ? It's toten. They're not hottentots. No, I can't speak German, but I can hear that it's sad music. The death of children. Kindertoten. Toten or "totten," they die in any case. "Nylon hysteria in America." It will soon be here. It's just a matter of time. Maybe it's a fad. - It'll pass. - No, no. Once women wrap their thighs in sandpaper, you can't stop them. It's sad that they don't know any better, but I mean if ... You mean I should give in and begin selling sandpaper ? Is that what you mean ? Never. Never. Christ, it's not primarily about money. It really is, it is... - An anomaly. - Exactly. But ... Even if ... Even if what ? It's too late anyway. Too late ? Why is it too late ? Go down in the cellar and you'll see. You mean you ... Remember that batch of wool pants ? Yes, on Lundavagen Street. "Due to changed market conditions." Suspiciously cheap. You bought it ? I couldn't resist at that price. Was it a big batch ? Barely room in the cellar. So you rented the neighbors' cellar. The Anderbjorks ? Christ, no. That was full. Whose cellar, Frank ? I'm thinking about the price. You couldn't have rented ... Yes, the Goat's. Not the Goat's. Yes, the Goat's. But ... that's not all. What do you mean, "that's not all." Another bargain-priced batch ? Yes, but not wool. - No. - Not wool. What could it be ? Silk ? What the hell ! Why not silk ? Was it silk ? Feinberger ... And the Goat's cellar was full of wool ? Yeah, you could hardly close the door. So you had to rent another place to store the silk ? - Huh ? - Yeah ! So what ? Where ? With that crook Karl Ohlsson ? Yes, it was more expensive than the Goat's, damn it ! There was so much crap in it. It was stuffed full of crap. I had to empty it out. It was a hell of a job to empty that cellar. I just wonder what their damn bedroom must look like ! The old lady ran around with jam and stuff like a fucking weasel. Every day for weeks. I already wrote it, miss. Do as I say. "The coast is clear. 7:30 p.m." May I go to the bathroom, miss ? Of course. One, two, three, four, five. GIRLS Two, three, four, five, six. One, two three, four, five, stop. Left face. - That's all for today. - Thank you. The turtle didn't hurt you ? You promised. I wasn't talking about Stig. I said the turtle. You learned something anyway. What ? You talk like them up north. What good is that to me ? You can talk to the turtle with a Stockholm accent. "Come to the box. Stig." Weren't you going to the john ? - Me ? - It's vacant now. - I already went. - Well, just to be safe. Yes, you're right. Welcome aboard. Where did she go ? Strange. Without her clothes. - Damn ! - We're moving. Guess we'll just go along for the ride. Where did you learn all those things ? On the job. I sell chocolate at the movie theater. Watching kissing on-screen and stuff. I'm so happy. I shall give the names of some of them, so you will understand ... the effort that has gone into finding ... the men of the Wolf. On the portside ... - Hot ? - God, yes. The whole factory wanted the windows open ... except that bitch Holm. She can't stand fresh air. So they were closed all day. We'll have milk with dinner. I had no coupons left, so I traded with Svea. Victor Rydberg is famous for what ? Ten letters. Santa Claus. You knew that. You should drink milk. That's where the calcium is. "Predator." Four letters, one of them an L. Wolf. You knew that one too. No, I didn't think of it. We always made sure you had milk when you were small. That's why you and Sigge have such straight backs. The kids who didn't get milk have crooked backs. What is it ? Nothing. That's why he's such a good boxer. Thanks to the Central Dairy. I'll go put these things away. The Crown has arrived on the scene now, and will play an important role. It is equipped with sonar. It was jaws. The Wolf. What's wrong with you ? Why should there ... It's nothing. You looked like you were going to faint. Puberty. SvenJerring reporting from the salvage ship Belos. No. Any adults at home ? No, just me. I'll stay until you've read it. "The submarine Wolf had just finished trials at sea..." Everything is all right ? I'll close the door. Nowa report on the rescue work from the west coast. The Belos here. I have nothing positive to report ... I'll do that. Are you going to help ? I usually do. Something has occurred that will be reported on the radio. How long have you known ? Why didn't you say anything ? Why didn't you say anything ? Sit down. I didn't know. I didn't know anything until we Did the crossword. Remember ? "Predator,' four letters. - An L in the middle. - That's when I knew. That's when I got Sigge's letter. He and I had a code. From the kids' pages. You connect the dots to reveal a picture. Remember the giraffes ? - Giraffes ? - It was always giraffes. But this time it was a wolf's jaws, Mom. Then I knew he'd got his wish to serve on that damn submarine. I didn't know anything before that. Why weren't we informed ? - Why ? - We were. A man came with a telegram. I hid it behind the books. I couldn't ... I'm sorry, Mom. I meant to tell you several times, but I just couldn't. I thought, if there's no danger, I didn't want to worry you. And there is no danger, Mom. There isn't. They've sent out all ships. - All ships are searching. - They're all searching now. One. The back row. That will be 1.50. Lieutenant von Dobeln in person, ready to hit the French at Hamburg. - Right ? - Yes, General. Good Lord, it's been 30 years since my first battle. And now I must beg headquarters to get a little whiff of gunpowder. Yes, well, there'll be no rattling, my boy ... I'll see if I can find him. Don't embarrass your uncle. From headquarters to General von Dobeln. Show him in. Please seal this. Yes, General. Sorry, General, but my betrothed ... At least let me try to explain. It's so disgusting ! I don't want to talk about it. - But I didn't mean ... - I never want to see you again. I wish you'd move away, or that we would move, so I wouldn't have to run into such a disgusting person. It's open ! We have to talk. We have to talk. Look who's here. A infrequent guest in my house. Give me the glass. You might cut yourself. Oh, so you don't want to. No screwing the little school teacher today. No lesson in applied biology, huh ? No longer interested ? Not in the mood to play hooky ? I'll show you, damn it ! Unbutton me. You hear ? Unbutton me. Unbutton me ! Unbutton me ! Undress me. Take this off. Take it off. Take it off ! You hear me ? Take it off ! Take it off. That's it. My bra too. Unfasten it. Stop stalling. You know exactly how to do it. Unfasten it ! That's it. Open the clasp. Let go. Let go ! There. What have we here ? Each course in its time. Appetizer first. You haven't forgotten your table manners, have you ? I'd like to speak to you. I need some advice. I'm listening. It's about a pupil I've had problems with for some time. Stig, please stay behind. It's over, after that thing with the bottle. I don't know what you mean. I asked you to stay because I feel I have to flunk you. - You won't be in my class ... - Flunk ? What the hell do you mean ? Exactly what I said. You won't be in my class next year. The official explanation will be repeated absence from class ... without a parental note. Also, you failed tests in my subject, which is personally offensive. That's the official explanation. You know the unofficial one, which is that I can't stand to have you in the classroom anymore. This happens to be a place of education, not a rabbit farm. Stop ! Why are you lying ? You know why I wasn't present at your damned lessons. I was in your bed, waiting for you to come home for a fuck ! - Don't talk like that. - What ? Don't talk about everything that happened that way. "Everything that happened" ? You think it was something special ? It was just an ordinary fuck. Nothing special ! Be quiet ! Aren't you afraid I'll tell ? Who would believe you ? Please leave the classroom. Albert. Stig. This was a difficult decision to make, given your family situation. Nonetheless, we are all in agreement ... that you should repeat third year next term. We don't see this as a punishment. We see it as a favor. We want to be certain, when you leave your old school, that you take with you everything it had to offer. We want you to leave the nest ... ready to fly on your own. She cut out the page numbers. How much have you had to drink ? - What ? - How much have you had to drink ? - I can take this off. - No, keep it on. Sit down. - It just tastes too good. - You know she's lying. You know why I didn't have a note when I was absent. Don't you ? I need your help now. Can I offer you something ? You can offer me the truth. You know she's lying. She's lying like hell. Talk to her, Frank. Or Kjell, or whatever the hell you're called. You can't ... It doesn't have to be official, but you have to talk to her. Can't you do something when I ... But you'll do anything to crawl to that pussy once a year ! Right ? There's nothing left. She's torn wide open between the legs. I made sure of that. "Storks saw us here in Skane." Be seated. Stig. It's something about his brother. They found the Wolf. It's a Flying Fortress, right ? You see it, Nisse ? Two engines are out. Think he'll make it to the airfield ? It's headed this direction. It's headed for us. God ! It's gasoline. Did you see who it was ? Was it the monitor in 3B ? Anything broken ? They're rapidly pumping out the dry dock, and soon the mystery behind the sinking of the Wolf will be revealed. A mine blew a gaping hole in the bottom of the hull. The explosion was so powerful that the hull almost broke in two. Fractures are visible all round the hull. It's a miracle it didn 't split in two while being salvaged. The Wolf filled with water and went straight to the bottom. There it hit a rock, and the bows caved in completely. The collision must have been terrible. This is the last time a ship in the Swedish navy will be called the Wolf. Recovery of the bodies of the 33 crew members began immediately. A crane lowered them one by One onto naval houseboats, where identification of the deceased took place. All crew members were immediately identified beyond any doubt. I've run and rerun that newsreel for you ... at least 20 times. I'll go up and shut it off now. Then we'll go home. It's best that way. Day by day, and with each passing moment ... Strength I find to meet my trials here. Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment, I've no cause for worry or for fear. He whose heart is kind beyond all measure. Gives unto each day what He deems best. Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil with peace and rest. It must be some kind of punishment. We would have written notes for you ... if you had just asked. If you were so tired after all that working at night. It's just a matter of time before the god Ra shows up. Night work ? Yes. Sometimes you didn't get home till long after we were in bed. I never wrote you a sick note, or whatever they're called. Note of absence. I can't forgive myself. There were mornings when you looked completely exhausted. I shouldn't have let you go to the theater night after night. What is it, Stig ? What is what ? There's something else. Besides Sigge and failing in school. Surely you can tell me. I'm your mother. Another time, when you're older and wiser. Where's Dad ? Day by day, and with each passing moment Strength I find to meet my trials here Strength I find To meet my ... Urban Sahlin. Stig Santesson. Stig Santesson. Not present. Karl-Erik Schoon.
