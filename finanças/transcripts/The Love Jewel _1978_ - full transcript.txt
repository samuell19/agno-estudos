Thank you. Good evening, friends and faithful listeners of uncanny secrets. Those who listen to us regularly... know that this 69th episode is dedicated... To a theme that must be approached carefully: possession. How'? Where? By whom? Under what circumstances can one be possessed nowadays? These are questions that you all ask and which, to be honest... the church does not clearly answer. Tonight, we'll take a bold position... and probe deeply into the subject. But first, a message from our sponsor: Oh, oh, oh, sir! Look at this hole! You must start all over again. You didn't drill deep enough... What you need is pistolox, a safe tool... always ready to use, with its sturdy, interchangeable chucks... and its accessories. Hello. Who is this? Ah, it's you, Serge! Where are you? I'm still at work, as you can see, Serge. Gordona? He says it's urgent. Ok, hold on! What's the matter now, Serge? You always seem to come at the wrong time! What? Are you joking? You're telling me this today? Go on, you idiot! No, not you, Serge. I'm warning you, if you let me down, I'll sack you. Stop it! That's enough! No, not you... all right, Serge. You're not part of my team anymore, then. And I will personally see to it that no one takes you back. What a bastard! Leave me alone, Adrien. I have to think about it. I have some good news for you, little fella! Two tickets to Djerba. - Are you interested, Bernard? - No, thank you. I'll let you have them at half price. You look down in the mouth. Did she fire you? Worse than that. Serge has resigned to take a job at Europe 1. And on top of that... The tigress asked me to replace him. It shows... you still have lipstick stains on the corner of your mouth. Congratulations, you handle it like a boss! Or maybe you're just lucky. Only three months to become a major reporter? You call that luck? I was flying out tomorrow... Now I have to stay to prepare the show. We're staying too. Just postpone your vacation... Of course... But I wasn't going alone, actually. Ilza turned down an offer from Playboy to accompany me, so... Ilza? The Swedish model I introduced you to ten days ago? Well, you bastard! You don't waste time! I didn't even screw her, so shut up! Anyway, now it's over. Stop crying over your lost mare! We have work to do. Hey, there's no rush, right? The recording is in a week. And what are we going to record? Gordona is going to the West Indies... And Stephen is investigating voodoo in Africa. What do you want to drink? A coke, like you... Waiter? Didn't Gordona tell you? What a bitch! We don't have anything to record... Serge used to give his texts at the last minute... You'd better choose a catchy theme for your debut, or else... How easy! Serge has covered everything. UFO's, werewolves, ghosts... the White Lady... Even the Loch Ness monster... and the Beast of GÃ©vaudan! Let's go through the mail together, we get plenty of letters from loonies. What's the waiter doing? Show me. Sadra will tell you everything: The present, the future, whatever you want, ok? I am too old and too skeptical. You'd better go see my friend. Maybe she can give you an idea for the show. - Show me your hand, the left one. - No way. Are you afraid of having your private life exposed, Don Juan? THE LOVE JEWEL Four, three, two, one, zero. Report on Hugo de Baal, reel one. You were right, my little Claire... our listeners' IQ is close to zero. The only useful thing we have IS an invitation Serge received... from Mr. de Baal, Hugo de Baal. I'm going to his house. Try to find some information on this guy to flesh out the program. His letter is in the ring binder. I just took a photocopy. See what you can find out about succubi, too. They are demonic creatures taking on a feminine appearance... to tempt hermits, according to the dictionary. Hugo de Baal claims he has discovered their secret. Are you crazy or something? Rushing like that in front of a car! I could have killed you. Do you want me to drop you off somewhere? Where are you going? Do you want to have sex with me? I'm not kidding. Look at that ring. Buy it from me and I'm yours. At least you found something unusual. How much is it? For the ring, of course. 500 francs. It's a nice one. - It belonged to Casanova. - Yeah, sure... OK, I'll take it. Where do you operate? Not in the cemetery, I hope! There's a quiet little path nearby. No way! Are you starting out in the business? You're like a stuffed doll! Do you think it turns the clients on? Come here... Here, put this ring on your finger. What for? As true as my name is Draga, you won't regret it. Unfortunately, it wasn't a dream. Fate has chosen you to be the next bearer of this cursed ring. For one whole week, you will benefit from its power. I urge you to sell it before! Once the deadline has passed, you will suffer a fate worse than death. Do it without delay. Every day that passes, you have to double the price you ask for it. Good grief, Claire! This trip is going to be full of surprises. Hello! Fill 'er up, please! Can I make a phone call? - Where to? - Paris. Just ask my colleague. You'd better use our phone, the phone booth keeps the change. Thank you. No, believe me, this is not a joke and I'm not drunk. I can describe this ring to you, if you want. Three rubies! Even if they are tiny, you got yourself a deal. All right, I get it! Oh, I don't care what you do with your conquests. Casanova's? Yes, I've heard. Okay. Send me your reel! I'll see what I can find. Hey, listen... You could have a kind word... for the one who is going to do all the research work! Sure. You're the prettiest two-legged computer I've ever known. But I have to leave you, my car is blocking the line. I'll call you back later, OK? Can you check my tires? I think the front ones lack a bit of pressure. Of course, sir, move on to the in flat or, please. Thank you. - Just a minute! - Oh, come on! I can't serve everyone at the same time! Oh, wait a minute! There, it's done. They were a bit under inflated. How much do I owe you? 130 for the gas and it's free for the tires. Thank you. - Hey, you eat like a horse! - Yes! I don't know why... Must be the fresh air. What will you have for dessert? Fruit? Ice cream? An ice cream and a double coffee. - By the way, can I make a phone call? - Sure. - Where is it? - The phone is right there. - It's quiet right now, isn't it? - Yes. Are you on holidays? No, I'm only making a report. Hello? Extension 405, please. Thank you. Hello? Bernard? Is Claire there? Sure! She was so afraid to miss your call that she refused to have lunch. I'll put her on. Adrien? Of course I'm fine. Don't worry. No, skipping a meal never killed anyone. Ah, listen! I found a lot of info about this ring. Your description fits. The three rubies are often referred to as The Devil's Fork. If it's the real one, you have to get rid of it as soon as possible. This jewel is bad luck. Don't worry... I've lost it. I'm not at risk anymore. Say, Claire, I just sent you a reel in the mail... but I'm in a godforsaken place... if you know what I mean... So you might get it late. Could you find some information on someone called de Baal? And secondly... Please also try to give me information about succubi. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Shut up! Never say that word here. Why do you think this place is deserted? I used to have banquets of 50 people before. Please leave. This is silly. What are you afraid of? Do you really want to know? Why don't you go and ask Dr. Serg? He lives next to the church. First of all, please promise me... that you will not mention my name in your program. I don't think that... the Council of the Order would appreciate it. OK. Do you want me to ask you questions... or do you prefer to tell me first and we'll record afterwards? I prefer the second option, I'm not used to interviews. Succubi are no laughing matter. The strength of the vampire, Bram Stoker said... is that people will not believe in him. The same goes for the succubus. I thought they were female demons. Let's avoid that old controversy about the sex of angels, fallen or not. I can tell you that succubi exist. Do you have evidence? Succubi have a special way of feeding. They absorb the life force of their victims during sexual intercourse... leaving them in a very characteristic state of weakness. Sorry to interrupt. There's an emergency, Francis. It's Mr. Martineau. Right, I'm off. Jeannette, my wife. Mr. Gomm, a reporter. I'll leave you to chat. Jeanette can tell you about succubi, she met one. Follow me... Don't be afraid, just speak into the microphone. Go ahead! Francis was away for several days. I was coming back from dinner at a friend's house... The night was very clear. Excuse me, I am subject to sleepwalking. Which way is it to Clerval? Well, you are lucky, I live there. Come on, it's not very comfortable but it's better than walking. - It's one mile away. - You're nice but... we have plenty of time... There, I've told you everything. I don't know how I found the strength to get back here... I was so weak. I don't see anything in this that implies the existence of a succubus. This sort of thing could happen to a lot of women. No. You see, I felt a kind of dizziness... an unhealthy attraction. I hate lesbians, the very idea repulses me. I'm a little skeptical. Please, you must believe me... I'm not telling you stories and... I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. Do you often have fainting fits? No, never. It's probably due to the trip. I've been driving since this morning. We have a room upstairs. If you accept our hospitality... Jeanette is right, I'd like to examine you in my office. Your pulse is abnormally low. I can't. It's impossible. I have to leave. I still advise you to see one of my colleagues... and as soon as possible. Don't worry, I'm not going very far. I am expected at the Old Oak, at Mr. de Baal's. Perhaps you know him? Yes... Allow me to give you a second piece of advice: don't go there. The appearance of succubi in the area... coincided with the arrival of this... unpleasant character. Welcome to the Old Oak. Welcome to the Old Oak, sir. I hope that you had a good trip, sir. Yes, thank you. My name is Alberto. NoÃ©mie, take the gentleman's luggage... and show him to his room. Mr. de Baal apologizes for not being here, sir. He's feeling slightly dizzy. He will join you for dinner. Please, sir. Shall I put your things away? Thank you, it's not necessary, I'll do it myself. Right. There is a closet in the back. Just ask me if you need more hangers. I'm sure it will be fine. Besides, I only have what I need for the weekend. I ran your bath. I hope you'll like the temperature of the water. Mr. de Baal wants the water at 102Â°F when I bathe him. Come and see. That's fine, NoÃ©mie. Thank you. Sponge or horsehair glove? Oh, it doesn't matter. Sorry, I can't rinse you out. I have to go downstairs. Dinner will be served in half an hour. I'm sorry. I hope you didn't wait for me. It's me who has to apologize for not having been able to welcome you... and to show you around the place when you arrived. Unfortunately, I am nailed to this chair. Temporarily, Mr. de Baal. Ah, this is Kate, my nurse... and my providence. This is Lois, my steward... and my niece Micky. Mr. Gomm is one of our most brilliant reporters. Congratulations, Alberto! I like the meals to be served at eight o'clock sharp. You live in a most charming area, Mr. de Baal. Thank you. Do you play chess, Mr. Gomm? Oh, I'm not good at it. I barely know how the pieces work. Oh, what a shame! The game of kings and the king of games, said dear Louis XI. Sorry, Louis the Fat. You're probably right, Lois. Check! My memory is failing. May I suggest you to try this ClÃ©s des ducs, sir? A classy Armagnac. Thank you, I'd love to. It's almost midnight. Good night to all. I'm going to bed. Checkmate. Since you have finished your game... perhaps we might broach the subject of my visit. You must be tired from your trip... and I don't feel that well either. We'll talk tomorrow. Kate? Take care of Mr. Gomm, Lois. I'm counting on you. I will do my best. Good night. You look distressed, Mr. Gomm. No, not at all. When Mr. Hugo is here, we have to respect certain rules... strict dresses, no make-up, austere music... I feel like I'm suffocating under a dusty cover. How long have you been living here? For centuries. Will you make me dance? What happened to your hand? - A wound? - A raw wound. That's why I have to keep this glove on at all times. Even when making love? Sorry, I forgot I have to make a phone call. Please do. You can use the phone that's in the hallway... next to Micky's room. Hello! - Did you have a restful night? - Not so much... I had a lot of nightmares. Excuse me, but... I thought you were paralyzed. Wrong, my dear friend. I only suffer from leg weakness... painful arthritis attacks that prevent me from putting my feet on the ground. Ah, there's Kate. Good morning, Mr. Gomm. Good morning, sir. Glad to see you're up and running again. Lois told me about your injury. If I can help you in any way... - I'm at your disposal. - Thanks. It won't be necessary. I am doing very well on my own. But you're doing it wrong! Enclosing your hand will prevent healing. What happened to you? If you don't mind, I'll go up to my room to get my recorder. Since you're feeling better, I'll use the opportunity. Could you deliver us some eggs, beer... a big roast... about 4 pounds. That's it, yes. Thank you. Morning, Alberto. Can I use the phone? Good morning, sir. Please be warned that we're having trouble with phone calls, sir. Stop eating yourself up! What's the point? I have a bad feeling. The death of that gypsy woman, that ring... and all the things I have learned about this de Baal... Look, this is ridiculous. Psychics and all that, it's all fake. You should know that after working on this show for so long. 405, hello? That's him. He's been directed to the wrong extension. Hello, hello? Adrien? Hello? Clerval post office? But... hang up! Hello, Adrien? Yes, I can hear you, where are you? Yes, in the mail this morning. Listen, please, don't stay there. Can you hear me? Believe me, this is much more serious than you think. Hello? Hello? We've been cut off. He'll call back, don't worry. I don't get it. I tried to call Paris... I was cut off. Now it seems the line is dead. There is some work going on in the area. You will get your call later. But... where is Mr. de Baal? It's just like you with your tape recorder... he forgot he had an appointment. I'm going for a walk. Hugo won't be here for another 2 hours. Don't you want to come with me? Some other time. I'm going to use the opportunity to work a little. No chance! It's too early, but let me do it. Hugo is growing impatient, we must do it now. Of course... but one after the other. As long as he keeps this glove, we won't get anywhere. I don't think so. Let me show you. There's another one here. Here you go. He needs a pick- me-up, Kate. Sorry to cause you so much trouble. I felt dizzy. I think I should shorten my stay. I'm not going to let you go like that. Don't worry... Luckily, we have an excellent nurse here. Thank you. I feel much better already. Kate, you can leave us now. If I need you, I'll call you. You are not injured, Mr. Gomm! Will you tell me the truth? This is Casanova's ring, isn't it? So you know about it? Oh, I have some knowledge on demonology... and not only on succubi to whom I owe the pleasure of your visit. It all started during my trip. If I don't hear from him by tonight, I'll call the police. I can imagine the commissioner's face... when you tell him your story, my poor Claire. Succubi and a cursed ring! I'll manage to convince him. Adrien is in danger, I know it. Don't tell me you're not in love with him! Well, what can we do? Come on! There must be way to find this de Baal! Of course. Just look in the binder! Adrien told us that he had left the original invitation. If it can make you sleep more peacefully... I am ready to buy this ring from you! Would you dare? What do I risk? You'll give it to me on Monday, it'll be fine. We'll go to my bank together. I don't have any checks or cash on me. Are you happy with that? Thanks to you, I'm going to have an excellent night. Thank you. Do you believe me now? And don't tell me that we accidentally put a match in this file. Take the next right to go to Clerval. Maybe the call we received was totally unrelated. There's more than one place called Clerval in France. Idiot! Why choose this village? Because a de Baal was beheaded here in 1657 for witchcraft. Who knows if his descendants still live in the area? They shouldn't appreciate it so much. Unless they want revenge, right? - This way? - Yes, take the first right. You? But... what's going on? Don't get agitated. You are... The doctor will be by later. Just get some rest now. I didn't dream it all, did I? The house, the succubi, the ring? You've been delirious, I would say. That's all you've been talking about for a week. You're lucky you didn't break anything in the accident. The accident? I don't remember anything. How dare you? Slimy larval You are my slave! Do you hear me, dog? Your disgusting mouth can only remove the dust from my shoes! You dog! Have mercy! Lick them! Come on, lick them! Come on! Again! Better than that! You're bound and helpless! You must suffer my whims! What am I gonna do? I'm gonna screw you. It turns you on, huh? Oh, that's nice! Please! Enough! No! No! Please! No! Enough! Please! Come on! Bastard! Fuck me! Fuck me harder! Faster! Faster! Yes! It's no use, Claire... There's no one there. I want to make sure. Ah, trespassing? No, thank you. Coming here was a stupid thing to do. Today is Sunday... What if Adrien calls? There's no one in the office. Oh, that's right. Okay, let's go back to Paris. You drop me off at my place and you go to the office. Okay? Yes. I know how you feel. I've seen the same reaction so many times over the centuries. Most people can't understand. Sexual energy is a vital fluid... that can be transmitted. Through Casanova's ring? Yes, I got it. Orgasm used to be called "La petite mort" in the past. What a beautiful expression! You haven't won yet! I suppose you tied me up for a good reason. I still have enough strength to... Save it! You only have a few hours left before the ring loses its power. You already know my allies? Do you really think you can resist three succubi? Being minor demons, succubi have limited powers... and the curse can sometimes be dispelled... by a burn, a sound, contact on a rough surface... Hello, yes? Adrien? Where are you? On the road? Are you crazy? What do you want to do at night in a cemetery? Adrien! Please, I beg you, no! Oh no! Adrien, I love you! Adrien! Adrien! What's he doing? He's completely... Miss! Miss... Buy my ring and I will...
