THE BIRDS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM ARE COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED IN MAKING THIS FILM ALL THE CHARACTERS AND INCIDENTS IN THIS FILM ARE IMAGINERY [devotional song] 'Losing mother at the age 4 years, can be considered my bad luck.' [panting] [panting] 'What if I can't save the girl I loved at the age of 25?' [bashing] [screams] [loud scream] 'To know what I'm fighting for' 'you must know what happened in my life 6 months ago' LOVER 'Sampath is care of address for sinners in Rayalaseema popular for pilgrimages' 'He's the biggest idiot I know since childhood.' 'It's good that we speak less about him.' 'If he lights a Cigar, it indicates someone is at risk' A journalist should write something to provide for his home but should he also sacrifice his life this way by writing at his will? 'He's Jaggu, he's like a brother to me.' 'Whatever Sampath says is like an order for him' No. Don't do it. Neither Jaggu asks for anything nor Sampath says something. Jaggu takes it as friendship as they grew up together. But I see Sampath's selfishness in it. Why didn't you wash the knife? Is it to show and pose at your wife? Go and wash it He stabs and I wash it, how long do I endure this bro? Hey, idiots do curse while they get stabbed. Curses of people dying are very powerful. Neither should a word escape the victim's mouth nor should he swallow anything. [car starts] She's Sweety, Jaggu's daughter. I'll take you to task if you spill the milk. Sit and drink them. She's my sister in law. She could be termed as a Goddess. We got to pay her fees. They've been sending notice. Haven't we just paid recently? That was the first term fee. We should pay the second term fee. Okay let's see. They always take the last place among the people brother feels are his own. He notices them only after the whole village is taken care of. Sister-in-law. Here's Sweety's fee receipt. Why do you do this now? Can't we take care? Hello, don't feel too bad. These aren't for you, but for me. I've grown up without knowing what's a family. I shall give the happiness I missed from childhood to my kids in double... triple.. make it ten times. -This is just a rehearsal for that. Okay? -Uncle! This is my life ambition. [welding crackles] Finally I'm Raj. Not just this city... No... No... I'm one of the best customized motor bike builder in this state. [music] [vrooming] I love romancing bikes. Why do I need a bike designed by someone for someone? I'll design it according to my likes. Be it a bike or life. He's my friend Radha, my technical support. He's now developing a program to start the bike using a mobile phone. [sprays] [motorcycle starts] Hey! Yes! Got it. What's this? Will it start by touch? -It didn't start because you touched it. -It started as I touched this. -Oh! What's this dude? This technological advancement is surprising! This is nothing. You know, a car can be started without a key and steering can be handled without being in the car and apply the brakes too? Super dude Above all, we can adjust money from our idiot for the Bangkok trip [tyres screech] Biryani for breakfast? [indistinct dog barking] Who's the idiot who cooked biryani early in the morning? That's yesterday's left over. I left it for the dogs. Maybe the dog didn't eat it. So he is. Hey. How many times do I tell you not to feed biryani to dogs? Okay, I'll feed you from tomorrow. Hey Udalu... Where did you disappear Raj? It's been long since you're seen Settle my account. What? I've seen a lot of such funny tricks. I'm asking the amount for the bike I gave you. -What I should get. -What I gave is more than enough. You make bikes out of scrap and ask for money as if it's from the showroom. 'Settle my account". Even I want the account settled. I'm an idiot to have come to speak with him. Dirty rascal... How much do you need? Bro, this is not gambling to look at the other's game first. This is life. Anyway what he gives you itself is peanuts. How can you run your home if you keep donating that? I'll take care of that and you take this What did you say? Peanuts? Do you mean Jaggu is working with me without paying him? What if not? Whats the payment for the ones who work hard and for the useless ones? Come here. Doesn't he know how to work? You think he is brainless? How many times did you see Akhari Poratam film? -25 times. -For what? In the climax fight, my heartthrob Sridevi collides her truck into a flight. She jumps after the blast and dies falling down. She already knows it would blast once. So I used to watch if she could jump a bit earlier atleast once. But she jumps after the blast everytime and dies falling down. I got pissed off and stopped watching it. -Dumb idiot... go. -Wouldn't she live if she jumped early? You come here. Ask him. Which is heavier among a Kilo of iron and a Kilo of cotton? -Tell him. -It's iron. Ain't it bro? How could cotton be heavier than iron? Iron is heavier. [chuckles] You fool... [motorcycle approching] He is of no use to us. Let's sell it out. Hey, just wait. Move aside You did it great, how much does it cost? 25 thousand. -He's paying money for Bangkok. -Here, take it. I think I paid a little too much. -Where's the key? -This doesn't have a key. Either to start or stop it, it's all with this phone. -Give the phone -Phone is a bit costly. -Huh, how much does that cost? -It's a Lakh. One Lakh, smart start!

Don't start again bro, I'm going now after planning from so long. "Even if that God comes my way, I won't stop from going to Bangkok this time" [tyres screech] Why did the hill itself come my way when I took the name of the god on the hill? Hey, why are you blocking the road as if to ask for donations for a festival? I've bought bats and balls. If you'd brought them along after playing, wouldn't he have understood who we are? Isn't this enough? So you brought it eh? Look bro, we've a work with him. You stop thinking over this and keep moving. -Move now. -Move. [motorcycle starts] Go...

If you say that's not possible, you can neither work there nor here. [motorcycle halts] Huh... Hey! Didn't we ask that boy to leave? Why is he coming back? We asked you to leave right? Did you forget something? Look dude, give him what he needs and send him. We've got to settle things. -You go bro. -Am I Sampath to leave you like that? If you are here, who would drop me at the airport? Come on. Oh! What's this mess? Guys, this looks to be a headache, take a look. Huh, why do you look at each other? Go and look into his matter. Hey... [gun cocking] Come on, what's this man? Haven't you been in the morning? Just manage for two minutes bro, I'll just be back Keep talking for two minutes. I'll just be back. Hey, I don't need tea now. It's time for my flight, we'll leave. Why do you look at his face? Don't you have the bats? Bash him up. Yes. [kick] [thud] Is that kick boxing dude? -My feet are frying due to the heat bro. Why do you tell your troubles when you have to bash him? Here, buy slippers. -What about me? -He'll give you. Go to him. -Mommy! -You go guys. Hey idiot, what're you doing? Hit him on the face. Don't wait till I come, come on hit him. Be the man that you say! Go! It's my turn now. No... Oh no!

[gunfires] Oh no, he shot me in the arm pit. Save me guys! -When did I shoot man? It shot by itself. -Wait guys. The dirty rascal ruined my shirt. Why am I feeling the pain when it's him who got shot? Oh god! Is it me who was shot? You idiot, to hell with your gun. Damn you! It's a country bullet. Let's go to the hospital. Bro, there would hospitals in Bangkok too. Just drop me at the airport. Bullets are not allowed in the airport bro. Doctor! -Hey, why are you shouting? -Where's the Doc? It's an emergency -What's this? -I got shot. -It's a police case. -He's coming behind! -What's this? -It's a waiting token. What do I wait for? I've got a flight to board! Hey! Where are you going? -Anji, Ramu... stop him. -Hey, stop. [door opens] We'll take care. Let's go. Take his CBP, shift him to the ward and keep him in observation for a day. Okay ma'am. -I don't want the injection. -Why are you scared? -How any times do I tell you? -Wait a minute. God! I was supposed to be in Bangkok. You threw me here on a hospital bed. Hell with my life. -Hi Lakshmi. -Hi sister. Where's the patient on this bed? The time my dream came before my eyes wearing a white dress. Okay. Temperature is fine. Did you take the tablets? I don't want tablets, I'll have tonic. I'll give you a chocolate if you take the tablets. -Promise me? -It's a promise. [phone ringing] -Hello! -Baby, try it once again. Mom.

[music] If it weren't for you, my husband wouldn't be alive. How would we have known these matters madam? We can't forget your help. Whats my greatness in this? Being elders you should bless me, not join hands. Oh dear girl! Are they her relatives? -We will take leave. -Okay. Relatives of Charita ma'am? Not just them, everyone in the hospital are her relatives Anyone would help by giving 10 to 20% of their salary. But she gives away her whole salary if someone is in troubles. Isn't it surprising? Isn't it great that the god who created people like us created that girl too? What did you say? Isn't it great that the god who created people like us created that girl too? I'm done with you, you can leave. -I'll give medicine in time as you said. -Good morning sir. Yes sir -Good morning sir. -Good morning -It's time for the bus, we'll go now ma'am -Is it?

Hand... [music] BP is high. You've been through just a minor surgery, okay? So, don't worry. Take both of them now, and this one after lunch, okay? No, those are to be taken after meal. It's this one now. No, it's this one bro. She told me bro. It's this one. What's the confusion for? Call that girl, she would give it herself. Please come to my bro. He needs your guidance in taking the pills. He's not much educated, so got confused. Good. -Bro, call that girl once. -Is it fun for you? Really bro, it's paining. Oh God. Looks like stitches broke loose. Please call her once bro. My brother says it's paining. Near the stitches. Anesthesia is fading. So there would be some pain. Nothing to worry, okay?

As you are leaving anyhow, call her once on the way. Get the file of bed number 32 patient. He is being discharged today. [groaning] Oh no, why did you come here? -You shouldn't move. -Actually... As the doctor asked me to be under your observation. Look, he asked us to observe you. Not that you should observe us. Hey man! It's your hand that's injured. your legs are fine. You boulder! -Where did your brother go? -He left on some important work doctor. -Oh no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a sister. -No! -What's wrong? -Are you and sis... That's for the world -You are my heart beat Doctor -What? I mean -You're the doctor who checks my heartbeat -Ok Doctor, you please stay right here. I'm very scared. [music] -What's your name doctor? -Shhh. Take rest. Doctor, will you check the BP? -I mean, it's been a long time -Not needed. Didn't I give you tablets? I'm sweating. There's a napkin in the bag, can you give it please? Here. What? Oh! Doctor. It's time the Doctor comes on rounds. I need to go. Please. Doctor! Why are we drinking on a hospital dude? Okay, open it. What a girl dude? Mind blowing! I never expected such a girl would come into my life dude Why are you getting so much excited? Is the girl so good looking? -No idea, I haven't seen her. -Yeah. No one among us have seen her. None of you have seen her. Kindness of Mother Teresa, beauty of Angelina Jolie Hey... Ain't it a bit too much? -Not at all. -He's onto her. Earlier when I heard the stories of great lovers, I thought they were exaggerating. But now I say that's no exaggeration. I'm feeling what they felt back then. [music] Where did he vanish? "Is the naughty dream in me facing me in your form?" "Has some love trap pulled me?" "Is the naughty dream in me facing me in your form?" "Has some love trap pulled me?" "These thoughts in heart are like uncontrollable naughtiness" "What's this sweet pain like a silence unable to carry words" [music] "Such a big cyclone in me and so much noise in the heart" "I'm escaping from expressing as its trouble for me to reveal" "The distance in between us is just a step if measured" "I'm unable to cross it as if life is filled in that one step" "Shall I build a bridge between us with the four letters of LOVE?" "Shall I write you a love letter joining the stars in the sky?" [glass shatters] "Is the naughty dream in me facing me in your form?" "Has some love trap pulled me?" "These thoughts in heart are like uncontrollable naughtiness" "What's this sweet pain like a silence unable to carry words" [music] [bulb flickering] He's been screaming and hallucinating the whole night. No one slept. Send him out of here somehow madam, please. -Hey, get up you! -Darling! Whom are you calling darling? You get up first. Why is everything misplaced? -What happened? -All this was done by you. -Oh no! Looks like I was high lst night. -What did you say? I mean that might be a reaction of Anesthesia and Antibiotics. Ok come Doctor, you got to check my BP. My BP has gone high without your touch. Hello, you've been discharged. You can leave now. Discharged? How can they do that? You are not my headache anymore. Oh no. Doctor, don't say so please. What if something happens after I go out? Who is responsible? Tell me your honour? My responsibility is only up to in patient ward. Though you have no responsibility as a Doctor, As a lover... I mean as a patient I'll be only under your observation. Did she give you a chocolate? They wouldn't. We shouldn't trust them. You see mine and I'll see his One, two, three, four, five, six... Stop! Huh? We've completed the seven steps. No one can separate us for seven births now. You'll lose your job if he's seen in the surroundings again. [music] Thanks sister. -Isn't mom here yet? -Today is double shift and she'll be late. How many days should I be here more? Doctor did say that you can leave soon. Poor mom! She goes to Rani Madam's house in the morning, then to Latha sister's house, she comes home after finishing work there, gives me breakfast, sends me to school and then leave for factory work I should study well and be helpful to mom soon. -Sister. -Yeah. That uncle had been taking your name for the whole night. I think he likes you. You don't know these things. He's just a patient. A doctor who can't love a patient is also equal to a patient, doctor. -Security! -Oh no, what's with you man? -Come on. -Hey. -Move. -Hey! -Did you note the vitals of patient? -Yeah I did. Please bear for a while. How are you? When did you come here? We came in the morning. His asthma has increased. He is unable to move even his feet. I thought of showing him once to the doctor once. Okay. But the operation should have been done already? None informed us madam. One minute -Sir. -Yeah. Actually this person should've been operated next. How could they operate someone else who is far behind in the list? Maybe she didn't turn up at the given appointment time. So can we sit without handling another surgery? Maybe the next person in order was operated. -I asked them. They said no one called. -What shall I do for that? Aren't you the in-charge sir? Ain't it your responsibility? Are you teaching me responsibility? I'm MBBS, FRCS and a senior surgeon. You're a nurse after all. Mind your own business. Do you think this is a hospital or a market? She's talking without even considering my seniority. Charitha. -This isn't how behave with your superiors -Sir -Apologise to him. -Sir, they operated somebody instead him. -What if something happens to him? -Shut up. Am I not here to take care if some mistake takes place? Do ask her in that way, sir. She is talking like we're into some business here instead of operating. I should suspend you for your reckless behavior, But I'm leaving you as this is your first time. -Now, get out from here -Sir You get out from here first. I'll look into this. -Why do you mess with these seniors dear? -There is some mistake happening. COIMBATORE [music] [phone ringing] -Do they serve Vodka to the visitors? -It is not Vodka. It's water. It costs 2000 bucks per litre. -They spend 2000 bucks to drink? -It's just to wash their face. Sir, central Minister is calling -Tell him I'm at Varadarajulu Sir's house. I'll make him call sir. Sir, I need your blessings. It's my daughter's wedding. If you agree, I will get my kids... Ow! [snip] What man? Do you think this is like the normal blood dripping from your hand? It isn't available even in 10 out of Ten Lakh people after searching hard. How carefully should you deal with such a rare blood? Hey, leave him Why do you get tensed for such a small matter? Nothing related to you is a small matter for me uncle. Good Morning Sir.. His health is deteriorating. It's safe if we that operate him the earliest How far has that donor search come? [phone ringing] -Hello -How far did it come? Sir, our people have been intensely searching from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. It's rare blood group. So you'll listen to a good news in a week at the most. Good Sir... Sir. The amount you sent is spent sir. If this financial help is strong, we can speed up even this search process Don't think about the amount. My father-in-law's life is important to me. Oh no, should you say that again? You'll listen to good news in a week. -It's confirmed -Okay. -Ok, what about that donor? -As I told you... ...the donor is not legally eligible. So, we can illegally give slow poison, make the brain dead and start our work That will take some time. I see. What's the matter dude? You asked to assemble urgently -Drink called us. -Its before us. -Raju's love story is become a mess -Should we have a peg or not?

Give me some idea to love. If the ideas have to come out, this should go in. Come on, let's have it. Don't behave like parents of greed, please. Idea dude Girls are mad about brands these days. You wear branded clothes from top to bottom and move in front of her. -Let's see why will that girl not love you -Correct -Hey, I'm not looking for a branding -Then? -For a bonding in between us. -Then you must watch James Bond films. Next. Write 'I Love you Charitha' on a big ballon and hoist it high in air at our clock tower junction Love is in the air dude, she will fall immediately. [chuckles] This is awesome. She already feels I'm a vagabond. You don't give me such cheap ideas again. Hey, will a vehicle in neutral move even if on full throttle? It's similar telling my matter to you. That's why I called Nelson to be on a safe side Who, that black Seenu? Is his name Nelson now? He should come and move the vehicle now. -He's the only flirt king of our batch. -Ask him to.

At least the work will be done catching up with professional flirts like me. Oh no, she looks like a boy is dressed up as a girls he's giving a show like he has hoisted a flag on Everest by wooing her. [laughing] Oh no! Why are you not laughing? Fearing that the drink might spill. -It won't, smile -Stop it guys I didn't put the drink before you to dance Then? To make my love matter step ahead -Hey Nelson. -No tension. I don't know what you do. Bring her to Coffee Day one day. Just once. I'll take care of rest of the story. Oh no, my head is breaking dude. Stop somewhere and we shall have tea. -Hey -What? I'm thinking how to get her for coffee, what's with the tea now? She'll come running as and when you call as you are the Prince of Nepal Brain should work sharply to convince girls, dude. That's why we'll have a tea and go, stop here. Hey, sugar is less. [music] -Hey. -Yes. When someone is in love, just his lover looks beautiful. But why is every girl looking like Miss World to me? Hey, people get so getting bored of wives after seven years of marriage. Why are you doing so just after seven days of love? -You think this is any weakness? -That is... Damn it! You'll go blind. Are you doubting my love? I'll not move even an inch even when a hundred such beauties come and tempt me. You said you won't move an inch, but went in a jet speed. [music] I have a doubt. when someone is in love, just his lover looks beautiful. But why do I feel you look like Miss World? Kindly don't misunderstand me. I'm already in love. There, my love stays in that hostel. As you disturbed me being in such deep love, I couldn't stop complimenting your beauty. That's all. -I feel I have seen you somewhere. -Sister, your bag. What are you here? Where's my darling? Gods must be crazy dude. Is it you? Why are you like this? She will be that way. Do you know now? Leave her now.

What did you just say? I'm making you go crazy in modern dress? What opinion will someone have on such people? Whats the big thing about opinion? One incident is enough for that to change. We are born one day and die on another day. Similarly we change our self after some incident. So, opinion can change any time. Ok, you come once for coffee with me. Maybe opinion on me might change What if it doesn't change? You should never disturb me again. Come on -Coffee -Haven't you've called for the same? -Hey! -Oh no -Come here -Don't shout so bro Okay.

Won't you find another girl? Why me? If you ask me why not just me but none knows it. Each boy has some voltage fluctuation in his body when he sees a particular girl. And then, he'll not understand what and why he does something He'll not set right until that girl comes and sets the fuse right again They switch on the main and say marriage and then the meter runs round fast You get such a long bill and transformer will blast seeing that. What do you say madam? You said last time. I will give the respect and value who the people standing on word Will you come again? Hey, have you come to set y love or to cut it? You rascals...

She's here This Doctor is fine for us, you carry on What? I came for the baby, Doctor I'm not the Doctor but sister No.. Sorry, it became a habit.

Your father in law should be careful first if the operation has to take place right? Are you safe first? Is the car you are going safe? What're you talking rascal? We can't attack him directly. Our only option is the technical edge He uses a high end car. If we can get the ECU in that to our control, we can hack that car Car hacking, how's that? You go as a company executive and get access the car His car runs with ECU. ECU means Engine Control Unit, just like our computer Door locks, steering, breaks and everything are controlled through that We connect this device in that car and install our software in that car's ECU Then our software runs in that car. And this is SMD, Spring Mobile Device [device beeping] Antenna here receives the signals through the network of simcard and transmits to us It activates our software through Bluetooth Then the whole system is compromised and the controls come into our hands I don't understand anything what you said. Will this work out? Chris Wellsec and Charlie Miller applied it on BMW X series in 2013 and hacked and next they hacked Jeep company cars also So I designed this device with that same protocol [music] [device blipping] [collision] [tyres screeching] Did you get tensed idiot? Ok, listen to this song and get chilled "Gunna Gunna Mamidi song from the movie Raja The Great" Hey! Hey! Didn't like the song creep? Ok, tell me which song does your uncle like and I'll play the same Father-in-law, I'll take care. You'll dont get disturbed. "Background score from the movie Kabali" Never in history did a greedy man and a hasty female be happy Sorry uncle. I'll take care. Boss, I think you still didn't get a clarity Hey... Your car is hacked. Though you are in the car, it's control is with me So, your total gang should be cleared from here in just one minute Hey.. go from there.. Go. Raj... listen to me. Raj... Raj listen to me. They say not to believe even the guy beside you in such matters How did you think I would believe a rascal like you? Hey, do you know how it feels when someone close loses life in front of our eyes? Here's a sample. [sprinkling] [truck honking] [tyres screeching] [sprinkling] [collision] [tyres screeching] Help. Hey! To give just 6 years of life to your uncle Do you take the life of a girl who has a life of 60 years? Hey, you said the problem is my lover till now, actually Charita isn't the problem but your father-in-law is. You said we shall clear it when there's a problem right? Take good care of uncle. Happy journey. [tyres screeching] [collision] Where's Lakshmi? Sister. -Dear. -Mom. Why so many troubles dear? See the troubles from your daughter, Mother-in-law. Don't even know whom to share with.
