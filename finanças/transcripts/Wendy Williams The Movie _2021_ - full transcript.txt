I mean, everybody's been asking me, "behind the scenes, behind the hype, I mean, Wendy, how you really doin'?" I've had a lot of time to think about it, and I've had enough with everybody else telling me who I really am. So now it's time to dish my own dirt... And, honey... Nobody does it better. If you really want to know my truth, come here. Closer. Closer. Come walk a mile in my size 11s. once upon a time, there was a little girl who was a really big misfit. Yup. Aged 11, size 11. Welcome to the street where I grew up. One day, the city council of neighboring Asbury park, where we had our first family home... Get in here now, Wendy! Will unanimously vote to rename this street Wendy Williams way. Yup! Wendy Williams way. We're late, and we got to get you ready. Back then, people just wanted me out the way. how many times I got to talk to you about this? When we get to the party, please, remember the code... Tl, tf, tm. "Wendy, don't talk too loud. Wendy, don't talk too fast. Wendy, don't tell too much." ow! Mommy! Wanda, can you come in here and help me, please? Sure. Wendy, we just bought you a size 12. Now we're going to have to go and get a 14. What are you going to do next, girl? Wendy... You'd be so beautiful if you'd just lose some weight. I'll do it myself, then. Let me just help you. No, I can do it. Okay. Yes! Ta-dah! Tommy, did you help Wendy sneak Twinkies? Nope! I'm going to a party! yes! this day stands out in particular as, shall we say, formative. Here's what I was thinking. If I obey the rules for once in my life and get my butt on that winning chair, I will be the hero today. mom! It's my birthday! I was supposed to win! turns out, even when I do play by the rules, things don't always go my way. What-what happened? I'm the fat black girl who broke the chair, but she gets to cry. Yeah, right! Well, thank you for having us. It wasn't my fault, okay? I can't take you anywhere. Just come on! Mom... Dumaur. there you go. ah, all those gorgeous celebrities, with their perfect bodies, fame, and good fortune. That's what I wanted. I told myself, one day. One day. come on, Wendy. are the rumors true? what you wearing? What are you wearing? Just one comment, just one comment! are you cheating on your husband? but it wasn't gonna happen just like that, you know? I mean, no fairy godmother was coming to rescue me. it's your weight putting pressure on your bladder. - it was anxiety. - I didn't... Let's try a new diet. Tuna fish in brine with mustard. But... That's it. I told myself, one day, you will show the world that a big girl can handle hers. Too much, too fast, too loud, too big... It will all make sense one day. It was my futuristic vision. oh. I got myself to college, and discovered radio. by sophomore year, I had my own radio show! Hey, hey, hey, roving reporter Wendy Williams here, bringing you the latest neighborhood scuttlebutt. I set my sights on the big apple... That's where my idol, DJ Carol Ford, was working. In the beginning, I had to go where the work was, including going to st. Croix. But I did not give up. I always had a back-up plan. I kept on plugging, and, eventually, visionary radio titan Cathy Hughes hired me to come work for her in dc. Hi! Good morning! Oh! Good morning, ms. Hughes. Dyana. Nice shoes. Oh, thank you. And I like yours, too. Oh, and I just want you to know that I've really been thinking about how to be an asset here, and, uh, I really appreciate you hiring me. Did you hear? I'm interviewing Ricky tony today. I mean, he is so... - Mm-hmm. - Cute. okay, I know what you're thinking. I mean, I'm looking good, right? Yeah, well, this particular diet I was on was a whole lot more fun than tuna fish in brine with mustard. coke was everywhere in those days. It suppressed my appetite and gave me all the chemical courage I thought I needed. Seemed like nothing was going to stop me. Nothing. But I was about to be proven wrong... Ricky tony is here with us, and his hit single, "make you feel it," is burning up the charts. This is wol 1450 am, I'm Wendy Williams, and... Hi, Ricky. Hi, Wendy. What's up, dc/Maryland? Nice to be back in the chocolate city! Oh, wow. You have a great speaking voice. It's a nice baritone. Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to find a pretty thing like yourself tucked away in this little am radio station. Oh, well, thank you, but, but let's talk about you. Nah, let's talk about you. How old are you? Old enough. Okay. So, "make you feel it." what is the inspiration behind this? M'lady, your limousine awaits. Oh... Thank you, m'sieur. This is so fun! So, we're going to a party? Is it like... Like a music industry thing, or... Yeah, indeed, it is. I just gotta stop by my hotel before the party. I've gotta change. Oh, well, do I need to change? Do I look okay? You look perfect. Oh. Oh... Let's go. I didn't have a clue. I thought this cute, talented music guy was going to be my boyfriend. How's your drink? Good. Cheers. Okay. Mm. Let me take that. don't be shy. What? You know, I'm... I'm not so sure... - About, uh... - Shh... Look, be cool, baby. Now, just lie down. I got you. Don't worry. Uh, you know... I, uh... Um... We're supposed to be getting to that party, right? - Right? - I thought you were old enough. Mm-hmm. Uh... Mm... Mm-hmm. Let's just... Just wait one second. - I, uh... - Shh... Wait, okay... Um, just... - Hold on. - It's okay. Relax. You're here. Let's enjoy each other. Shh. Wendy... Wendy... Damn. Oh... You can let yourself out. back then, they called that "date rape." it was rape. It was also the last time anyone was ever going to tell me to "shh." so... I hear you left with Ricky tony himself last night. I just want to say thank you so much for letting me play a contemporary song here and there during my shift. My listeners are really responding. My call number is increasing every single day. I'll be playing a lot more like that. A lot more of my own thing. Thank you so much again for the opportunity. just keep moving forward, Wendy. Just keep sending tapes to new york, Wendy. just keep thinking about tomorrow, Wendy. there was this new, incurable disease called aids out there. It was the most urgent health problem facing the world. After I was raped, I knew I had to get tested. Waiting for the results was agony. I was terrified to die. Jackson... Jackson in the pocket... Throws, and looks like... Mm-hmm! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. that was quite the catch... hello? daddy? Oh, hello, Wendy. How are you? People in this business... Entertainment business is just really crazy, dad. Why don't you come on home and get a steady job in a stable field? Something sensible? No, no, it's fine, dad. Look, this is my dream. I just can't let it die. Aw, come on! - Dinner's ready! - Okay. I'll talk to you later, okay? All right. I love you, daddy. I love you, too. Oh, man. my aids test came back negative for four months in a row, so I decided to stop living in fear. I wasn't going to let the fun in my life be taken away from me. I was going make my own parties. my shift on wol wasn't until 3:00 in the afternoon, so that gave me plenty of time to sleep it off and to make it to work on time. I was never late, and I never missed a single shift. No vacations for me. I was on a mission and I had faith in my vision... New york. Sure enough, after sending out resume after resume and sample tapes galore, it finally paid off... I got myself a second job. It was only part-time, but it was in... New york. Hey, hot 103.5, new york. I'm the new girl, Wendy Williams, and this is my spot. Here's Taylor Dayne, "tell it to my heart." she made it to new york. That's right, dc, this is Wendy Williams on wol. That's right, new york... my weekend job in new york was super important to me, but I wasn't under contract, so I kept my weekday job in dc and drove between the two. By now, my relationship with cocaine was the most important social relationship in my life. I dated casually, but finding friends who weren't starstruck by my new fabulous lifestyle were hard to come by, so I was my own best friend. No one better. I did so well for hot that they offered me a position full-time. Hi, dyana. Hello, ms. Hughes. I've been offered a full-time position at hot 103.5 in new york. they threw me out like I was trash, but I went from making $9,000 to $60,000, and like they say, success is the best revenge. get out of my office. Out. ♪ And you don't stop... ♪ all right, new york, it's your girl, Wendy Williams, on the air tonight. I really like that guy, bobby brown. I think he's just so tal... I mean, he's come such a long way, too. I was at hot 103.5 for two years. I had a great time and I worked hard. And when hot 103.5 became hot 97, I had an even greater time and worked even harder. Hey, new york, it's your girl, Wendy Williams. I hope you guys are enjoying this beautiful, gorgeous, sunny day... And I'll never know the truth of why they fired me. It was a huge blow after I'd worked so hard and was thriving. Fired? But I'll never forget what that guy who fired me said... "go get married and have some babies." what type of shit is that? Most people don't know this, but I was never unemployed more than two weeks my entire adult life. Mm-hmm. I love my work, and the hustle wasn't about to stop just because some fool couldn't see what I was worth. I knew somebody would... If I could just get in front of their desk. The woman, the legend... Carol Ford... What a trailblazer... My icon. I was determined to meet her program director, tony gray, the biggest program director in the country. I parked my ass in the lobby of kiss-FM every day. While at night, I worked as the only black girl on air at an all-white pop station. No growth for me there, though. You know. while I waited for tony gray to give me a shot, I read up on the tabloids, because if and when I got my chance to impress him, I had a plan... Wendy. It's you. oh, hi, I'm Wendy. I know. Get in here. Oh. Carol Ford is on vacation, and my regular fill-in just fell through. You've been sitting out there for two weeks, so... You get the shot. Lucky you. Actually... You've made your own luck. Wait, did you just say I'm filling in for Carol Ford? Yep. Song list. Commercial reads. You know the drill. Yeah. Make me proud. there it was... The winning chair. ♪ Violate any body you see clockin' my chain ♪ ♪ I grabbed my lady by the arm ♪ ♪ and I sway ♪ ♪ while I'm watching all the fiends ♪ ♪ hypnotized by the bass ♪ ♪ the bass getting stronger as we moving along ♪ ♪ while I'm concocting the rhyme ♪ ♪ that I'm about perform ♪ ♪ wait a minute ♪ that's one of my favorite songs this year, from one of uptown's finest. I'm Wendy Williams, filling in for Carol Ford. I've got more of today's hits coming up for you, but first, new york, let's dish some dirt. the word on the street is, the duo might actually be lip-syncing over other people's voices... - What did she just say? - Which is scandalous, because they just recently won a Grammy for best new artist. And according to page six, did you know that their real names were Pilatus and Morvan? Anyway, friends of theirs have said they had never heard them sing before they were milli vanilli. It's so cute. It's such a scene. Okay, look, I'm Wendy Williams, and this is kiss FM. We don't do that here. Not on the radio. Yeah, right, I know, okay, but listeners want to know this type of stuff. I mean, they have a right to know. It's revolutionary! Wendy, we're going to find you a permanent spot here. Wait, what? Welcome to kiss FM. Oh, my g... thank you! Thank you so much! I'm gonna play a song for you, tony. Thank you! Oh, my goodness. Hey, good morning, new york, it's your boy, Jeff Foxx, in the studio with ken Webb... Good morning! And the lovely Wendy Williams... Hi! Good morning! Here with the kiss wake-up club. - Let's go! - Let's get it! Aw! Hey, Carol. one week later, tony left, and Vinny Brown became the new program director. He was ambitious and competitive, and he didn't want to lose his best jocks, so he created a new morning show and gave me a contract. Up next, it's time to... What, Wendy? Oh, it's time to dish the dirt, Jeff. Ooh, you know I like it dirty, Wendy. Oh, yeah, I know you do! I'm a bad boy, Wendy. Oh, oh... Even Carol Ford thought I was good. I want to know, where did you get this stuff? I'd tell you, but then I gotta kill you. come on, Jeff. We need you around, now. I gotta stay, I gotta stay. Today, I have a story about a popular R&B singer. I won't name him, but he's part of a group with two big hits out right now. I know who it is. I know who it is. Okay, apparently... Mm. This singer has been cheating on his wife. He and this other woman have had a baby together. Yeah, but they ain't being too smart. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know what irony is. Not me. "dish the dirt" became so popular that my previous life of privacy and anonymity was no more. Um, excuse me... You're Wendy from the radio, ain't you? Yeah, that's me. My homegirl over here, her boyfriend used to date one of them girls from total. She got some juice on puffy. He ain't paying them, and they broke as hell. Tell me everything. Last night, I found out that despite being one of the biggest R&B groups out right now, the ladies of total are broke. Yup. I heard they signed a bad contract with puff daddy's bad boy records, and all I gotta say is puff, pay your artists. I mean, they work so hard for you. I had to hire myself some major muscle. You just need to pay them. This is Wendy Williams on kiss FM. Thanks, Cory. - And a personal assistant... - Let me eat a fry. Who I called skeletor. No, skel, 'cause you know you just can't eat one. That's foul, Wendy. Here. Well, I'm gonna be foul today. Oh! What's this? Turn to page 65. Okay, where... Oh, my god! Boom! There I am. Always knew I would be! "radio star at one of the biggest stations in the country..." "becoming the queen of new york radio"!? My god! I'm in a magazine! You did it. oh, my god. Okay, hold on. Let's celebrate. Hey, new york, I got a song for you right now. We have to celebrate! Get into it! Yes! Oh! Go, queen! Go, queen! with my career firmly on track, I felt ready to have some fun. I met Eric b when he and Rakim came to kiss 98.7 to promote their latest single. We started dating, and I was thrilled to be seen on the arm of a certifiable star. I mean, that music was everything, okay? Still might be. And he was mine. All mine. At least that's what I told myself. oh, Eric b. Yeah, baby. Say my name. Wait, wait, baby, Eric... Take that thing. Oh... Ah... Okay, I'll be right back, aight? Okay. Hey, can I get your car today? Oh, what's wrong with yours? Oh, uh, I'm getting some new rims. Okay. Well, I need it back by 5:00 so I can get to work on time. Look, I got you, baby. Mm. Okay. he did not have me. He's gonna be here soon. He's gonna be here soon. Yeah, I got you, baby. Yeah, I got you, baby... Come on, hurry up, please. He messed up big-time. I should have realized I was just a booty call and he was using me. But instead, I rented him a car... On my credit card. So this weekend, spike is hosting another family day in the park. This is Wendy Williams on kiss FM. What's going on? Your phone's been ringing off the hook! Why, what happened? Some car rental company's about to issue an arrest warrant if you don't bring the car back! What the hell? You got it? - Yeah, I got it. - Aight. motherf... I paged you 911 two hours ago! You told me you returned the rental car two weeks ago, but you didn't! Now they're issuing an apb on me. They're not going to arrest me, because I'll call the police on you myself if I ha... Wait... Did you just... You mu... asshole! God damn! our relationship... I mean, if you could call it that... Didn't even last a year. When it was all over, my credit was ruined. You're welcome, bitch! and I was growing his seed. I went alone and I went in secret. I didn't tell him or anyone else. It was one of the loneliest experiences of my life. right there. Skel! You better be good tonight. Oh, no, he's good. Come here. Eh, you see my boy over there? Yeah? That's Kevin. He wanna know when you two can hook up, get yo' pathfinders dirty together. Kevin... if you'd told me this guy was gonna be my husband, I wouldn't have believed it. Well, we'll get to it. And yeah, I'm skipping over my first husband because he was just a rebound after the disaster with Eric b. Starter marriage, lasted five months, and frankly, it's not interesting enough to talk about. Okay? By this time, the same company that owned hot 97 purchased kiss FM. And with my audience being a younger demo, I was promoted back to hot 97. I wasn't looking for his number. I'd kind of forgotten about it, to be honest. But there it was... And I thought, "what the hell, why not?" yo, you've reached kev. Drop your number, and I'll hit you right back. this moment changed everything. Kevin. hello? This is kev. Wendy. I'm at 1440 Broadway. I get off at 7:00. If you're here, we'll ride. If not... Your loss. hello, Kevin. What's happening? Are you in a relationship? Nah. Does someone else think that they're in a relationship with you? Nah. Hmm. How old are you? I'm good and grown. Is this car registered to you or to a woman? And if it is registered to a woman, it better be your mother. Yo. I love my moms, but this car is mine. I've paid my way. I have a hair salon in flatbush, I work as a party promoter, and I do a couple other things to make ends meet. I like you. I saw you across, you know, the spot, and I was like "yo, that's an empress right there." I knew it. I knew it right away... I could fall in love with this man. We wanted to see each other all the time... Just laws of attraction. And bam, we were a couple. All right, oh, you got a Heineken. Yeah, a heinie. A heinie, that's okay. Thank you. Cheers. Oh, you gotta look at me. Mm. - 'cause you know... - I know. What the rules are. - Oh, I know. I know. - Uh-huh. I looked away one time. How long ago was that? Mike Tyson. That was it. - Mike Tyson. - Yeah. - Street fightin'. - Did you know him? I mean, we all knew mike. you know how attractive a thug is when he lets his guard down? Mm. I mean, he's still a thug, so you feel protected with this big, strong man, but there's more there. The way he opened up to me... You are a professional. After high school, I just started, you know, just done on my street gang, you know what I'm saying, so, out there hustling one night, then I started promoting parties, and... he told me he had been on his own since he was 17. He told me about his hopes and dreams for a happier future. What do you know about hair? We had each other, physically and emotionally. I felt safe. And not to mention... ♪ ...And the touch of your hair ♪ ♪ I'm lovin' the way you kiss me ♪ ♪ when you're kissin' me there ♪ ♪ I'm feelin' you so much ♪ ♪ I don't even care ♪ ♪ 'cause I won't be happy unless my baby kiss me... ♪ Kevin was starting to become my everything. ♪ ...I can hardly sleep at all ♪ ♪ and I'm not afraid to feel the way I do... ♪ what's all this? Two months, and you ain't bored of me yet. Figure that's worth a celebration. Look, wait, um... Wait a second. Okay, cool. You can tell me. I think I like you. I think I like you, too, Wendy. A whole lot. Every week before school, I, uh... I had to get weighed, because I was too fat. I figured out putting the scale on the bathroom rug made it read wrong, you know, took a couple pounds off, so... I did that... But my folks figured that out. By the time I got to high school, I was bulimic. I mean, well, I tried to be bulimic, but the whole thing was a mess, and I was not ever trying to clean a toilet. I mean, the whole thing was just... Exhausting. I, uh... I don't want to be exhausted anymore... So I'm planning on getting liposuction and breast implants. I think you're beautiful the way you are right now. Oh, f... that corny shit, all right, and let's get real about these fat lil' titties. Look, I'm not asking you to pay for it, and I've already decided what I'm doing, so you can spare me the ugly duckling speech, because my inner swan needs a little help making an appearance. I'm just... Sick of how my outside doesn't match who I am in here. I hear you, and I promise you... No matter what, I'll always support you, whatever you need... No matter what. So, let's talk about these breasts. Yes, doctor, I want them that big. Large, in charge, voluptuous, show-stopping. Look, I'm a big girl who needs big girls. Okay. You got it. Okay. Here was warmth. Here was companionship and support. Here was understanding. I wasn't alone anymore. Kevin may not have been the man that my mom had prayed for, but he was the man that I had prayed for... A thug with a heart of gold. Kevin saw me. He loved the whole of me. And I loved him for that. Plus, I felt safe with him, like he could protect me, and that was important... Because things were about to get hot in the streets. ♪ Nah, na na na nah ♪ ♪ na na na nah na na nah, na na nah ♪ ♪ na na na nah ♪ ♪ here comes the hotstepper ♪ ♪ murderer ♪ ♪ I'm the lyrical gangster ♪ ♪ murderer ♪ ♪ pick up the crew in-a de area ♪ ♪ murderer ♪ ♪ still love you like that ♪ ♪ murderer ♪ so, look, if you're going to lay on a table and have somebody else cut you open, I say you see at least three doctors first, and then you decide between them. But most importantly, I say pay for your own plastic surgery. I mean, seriously, do you really want some future ex-boyfriend out here talking about how he bought your breasts? I mean, skel, would you do that? Hell, no. You better not. Okay. Oh, um, it's 78 degrees. Stay tuned, because we've got more hits for you from biggie, nas, and tribe called quest after the break. You're off the air next week. What? Why? You can't talk about your plastic surgery on the air. You do realize that 80% of the stars that we interview here have had work done? I mean, skel saw it, I saw it, everybody sees it! You're off the air for two weeks. And when you come back, tone it down, okay? How dare they? It's your surgery. Yeah, I tell it like it is! I'm not about to pretend! You know, Kevin should be here any minute now to come pick me up. Just wait till he hears about all of this! what you talkin' about, Wendy?

Won't let nothin' happen to you. - You understand that? - Okay. - I got you, okay? - Thank you. Let's go. I was dating a nice man, a man who knew I had a cocaine habit, and though he made it clear it was something he did not support, he never pressured me to stop. It took me four days to quit. Ooh. Cold turkey. It wasn't easy, but I knew why I was doing it, and it was time. ♪ I need a new day to start fresh ♪ ♪ time to get back to me ♪ ♪ you've got a goal yes, I know it ♪ ♪ suddenly I made up my mind ♪ ♪ starting over... ♪ he asked me to marry him. Now, I wasn't in a hurry... I'd already had that starter marriage... But it felt good to make things official with a nice big piece of ice. News of me getting engaged was so big that page six wrote about it. Page six started writing up a lot of stuff that was going on with me because I started revealing the real-real skuttlebutt at work. This weekend, I was at a photoshoot, okay, and my photographer, who happens to be a lesbian, she gave me a copy of one nut magazine. I'm new to one nut magazine, but there's this fascinating article in there about this gay rapper, and it's very, very detailed. Okay, look, look, look, so, look, all I want to know is, DJ red alert, who this gay rapper is. Yo, son. I have no idea. You know that some of these hiphop guys are into this lifestyle. - You know, red alert. - I don't. I got no comment, Wendy. You got no comment? You gotta... You gotta spill it. Dish the dirt. Don't look at me. Red, get a little closer to the mic. Look, bes... See, I told you he was in the lifestyle! Aah! - Not my lifestyle, Wendy. - Wendy, stop. He's like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! That's not my scene, Wendy. Everyone loved it. Let's play a guessing game. Okay, okay, maybe not everyone. I just hung up with puff. What did he want? Is he getting me fired? No. Look, I can't fire you. You're under contract. So...? So I'm going to pay you even if you're not working. So I'm suspended? I got the biggest music producer in the industry up my ass. You're causing more trouble than you're worth, and I'm over it. Well, then, fire me, so I can work somewhere else. What kind of dummy do you think I am? You are under contract, and as much as I don't need the drama anymore in my life, I don't need you running off to the competition in this city, getting bigger ratings over there. Are you going to let me back on the air again or not? I have no idea. Hmm. You're about to have a heart attack. Slow down. Don't tell me I can't work anywhere else. Check the fine print, bitches. It says I can't work anywhere else in new york. So I guess it's "bye-bye, big apple!" I'll take a bite out of another city. Wendy always has a plan. What? I'm outta here! Philadelphia, get ready! Wendy Williams is coming to town! new york city's shock jock, Wendy Williams, is, indeed, set to join Philadelphia’s power 99 morning. ...From jay-z, q-tip, Mariah Carey... I'm gonna be a mom! babe, you wanna order some room service? Throw the ball! Come on! I wonder if they deliver Philly steak sandwiches. Yo, Wendy, f... hot 97. No more tears, yo! They lost the best thing they ever had. - We 'bout to tear Philly up. - Kevin... They don't even deserve you. Kevin... ha... I told you Philly was going to be good! when I started, they were ranked the 15th spot in Philly. By the time I left, we alternated for the top spot, so that was good. Your girl, Wendy Williams, right here at power 99. I'm gonna come in like a hurricane. Hey, power 99, it's your girl, Wendy Williams, here, and... Look, I got something I want to share with you. I was seven weeks pregnant... And I miscarried. Now, I'm fine, Kevin's fine. The doctor said losing a pregnancy at this stage is extremely common, so... Anyway, I have two questions... Because I'm new to the city, so. I just wanna know where's the good hair and who makes the best Philly cheesesteaks? Trigger warning... The rest of this story is going to be rough. It didn't take long before I was pregnant again. Oh. Five months into my pregnancy, I lost that baby, too. I told myself to just keep moving forward and try again. And guess what? Hi. Okay. I got pregnant again, and everything was going great. Oh, five months. Oh, sh... Oh! Until it wasn't. Kevin! Kevin! - Kevin! - Call an ambulance. You okay, baby? Baby... you're going to be okay, y'hear? It's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay, right? Mm-hmm. That's right. That's right. Excuse me, ms. Wendy. I don't mean to be rude, but I listen to you every day. Can I have your autograph? What's your name? Brianna. Thank you, Brianna. I'll get that for you later, okay? Just keep on listening. God bless you, Wendy. thank you. It's going to be fine this time. - Wendy. - Hi. Kevin. I've looked at the scans. I'm sorry. Your baby is stillborn. What? Wendy, the baby didn't make it. We're still going to have to have you deliver because you're so far along. Oh, no. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear. no, no. Okay, doc, all right, we heard you. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay, baby. No, it's okay... I'm sorry. I can't do this. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I'm so sorry. But it wasn't fine. Oh... It was a girl. A baby girl. God, help me, please. No, no, no. Kevin, you've got to take this. let's go home. Let's go home. okay. hello. You must be Wendy and Kevin. Please step up to the front with me. Please join hands. Kevin was convinced that maybe god wouldn't bless us with a baby unless we're married for real. Kevin to be your husband? Kevin, do you take Wendy to be your wife? you may kiss your bride. So we got married! Yes! And I got myself a new doctor. There's a few things. You have a hyperactive thyroid, and I've diagnosed you with graves disease, which is related to thyroid function, so... Why do my babies keep dying? I was getting there. Wendy, your cervix is a little weak, so when you stand, your body isn't able to hold the weight of a baby. My cervix is a bit weak? I've seen four different doctors, I've blamed myself, my husband... I mean, the abortion I had in my early 20s. I mean, I regretted every time I smoked a joint, I took a drink. Now you're telling me that it's just as simple as I just need to lie down? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Kevin. This one. This is our baby. And I'm telling the station... Non-negotiable... I'm working from home, on bed rest, my entire pregnancy. I'll research equipment so you can broadcast from bed. Yes! Yes! Hey, it's Wendy Williams. I am tuning in at home, on bed rest, 'cause, you know, we are expecting a little baby, me and Kevin. I got Kevin sitting here with me right now. yo. No, we're not doing "ask Wendy" right now. Bye. And I mean, I thought it was the most cutest... Cutest moment ever. You want to do it there? All right. over the next nine months, I put on 103 pounds. I stood up for no longer than five minutes at a time, and when he wasn't hustling back and forth to new york, my husband waited on me hand and foot. Hey, everyone, I'm back on the air. You know, the doctor said I could just walk for, like, five minutes a day. We hoped, we prayed. oh, god. You got this. Push, baby, push, baby. okay, baby. Yes! yes! Yes. Where's daddy? you did it, girl! just perfect. I'm about to tell you a lot of crazy stuff about my marriage, but my son is off-limits. Babe... Shorty, just calm down, all right? How much you need? All right, give me a few days and I'll get you some money, all right? - Okay. - ahem. What, what? Hold on, hold on. Wendy... Wendy! Wendy, give me... Get off of me, Kevin! Who the f... was that, huh? Who the f... was that, Kevin? It's this girl I was seeing. But it's over, baby, I swear. Wendy, we haven't had sex in a year... I was on bed rest, gaining over 100 pounds, to give life to your son! I know, baby, but this was hard on me, too. The miscarriages, watching you stuck in bed all day. I just needed someone to talk to. I swear, it's over. She just wants some money. It's over, baby. It's over. - Mm-mm. - Wendy... Wendy, come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I did not believe him. You know how I always say you should have a private investigator on speed-dial? This is the origin of that philosophy. I wanted to kick her damn ass, but I realized the affair was his fault. People always blame the woman, but it's him who's married with a new baby. she don't mean nothing to me. You're so goddamn boring. - I'm boring? - Mm-hmm. You're boring. You're arrogant. Everything I do I'm doing for you. I'm out on these streets. I'm protecting you. Everybody got a hit on you because you want to out every rapper... From diddy, meth... All these people... Because you're calling them out. You got a coke habit, but I'm boring! I just wanted to have some fun! If you ever cheat on me again, Kevin, I swear... And I promise you, you will lose me. - You will lose me. - I'm sorry. I took him back... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I would never love him the same. I'm sorry. I need to get an std test, and I'd like to get an iud placed. Well, while I was pregnant, Kevin cheated on me with some whore. And I just want to make sure she doesn't have anything. And I don't want any more kids, so, I'd like one of those 10-year iuds. Obviously, Wendy, I'm your physician, not a marriage therapist, but I do think that maybe you and Kevin should talk or go to counseling before you make this decision not to have more kids. Respectfully, I disagree. Now, Kevin made his decision, and now I'm making mine. My body can't take another baby. All right, come on, let's go. remember, I always have a plan. That was taken care of. Now I had to get us both out of philly. Out of sight out of mind. I got my body together, got the work done. I'd been gone from new york for years and they still didn't have a new "Wendy", so... vinny! You look good, Wendy. Oh, vinny. Thank you! All right, you called me. I'm here. Spill it. I want back in new york. And you're at wbls now. Wendy. First, I can't pay you what you're worth. Second, we don't have anything open in the mornings. Okay. Well, I want afternoons. You wanna do afternoons? My own show, my way. What's your budget? vinny! Wendy, look. I'll do what I can, but more money will be hard. Six-month contingency raise? A signing bonus? Come on. Tomorrow, when I call you with a number, you're going to take it and you're going to like it. Okay. Wendy's back at wbls. - Hey. - Hey. Guess who called today? Who? Vinny brown from 'bls. He wants me back. Hell yeah! That's what I'm talking about! I knew they'd come crawling back! I knew it. Yo, give me his number! so I got us back to new york. Him, me, and baby makes three. Not long after we got there, 9/11 happened. I was actually supposed to start work on that very day. Everything was different after that. I stopped thinking about where Kevin was all the time and settled into our new life... Decided to focus on the hope of us just being stronger as a family. This was our second chance. I also decided to write a book... About my life... The ups and downs, the highs and lows. It was only 90% narcissism. The rest of it was about wanting to help people see that when you rise and fall, you can rise again. Oh, hey. In this book, I'm going to be honest about your affair. Aight. The book got published, and there was a huge launch planned. It was going to be in times square, but I didn't think anyone was going to show up. Wendy. Hey, baby. You ready? Tell me what's wrong. What's wrong? All your dreams are coming true. Times square! Who do I think I am? What if I embarrass myself? I mean, I'm not a book-writing kind of girl. Yeah, but you wrote a great book. It's real, it's raw. People need that. What if nobody shows up? Are we talking musical chairs here? No, no, no, no. Look at me. Look me in my eye. What do you see here? I see that you believe in me. That's right. Your book signing is going to be a mob scene. All right? Madame. Now... Are we ready? As difficult as my relationship with Kevin could be, he knew how to reach me... And he was right... We had a new york times best seller on our hands. And my radio show was climbing the charts. Life was good. Whitney houston! hey, whitney in the house! Now, whitney, are you still on drugs? I thought she was going to hang up. I thought so, too. That's my girl. That's why I've always loved me some whitney houston. Ladies and gentlemen, we have ms. Mariah carey! - Yeah, mariah! - hi, mariah! Hey! hi! We're so happy to have you here! You know, you've changed your style. Remember, she used to be really dressed... - all kind of covered up. - All covered up. You gotta be free. Be free. Let yourself go. This big change... Was this before or after your breast implants and all that stuff? no, you didn't. Oh, my... she hung up. You know, I know this guy, kanye. He's producing for jay z right now, but I see really big things for him. I wasn't just Wendy Williams anymore... I was the Wendy Williams experience. Things couldn't have been better... Until... Excuse me. Where's arlissa? Sorry, I got no idea who you are speaking of. The girl who normally takes the tickets. Why are you collecting the money instead of pushing the liquor? I dunno. Kevin told me to be here. Kevin told you to be here. Charlamagne, who's that? that's my home girl, sharina. We grew up in sc together. Is Kevin f... her? All I had was suspicions. People around me said I was paranoid. Kevin had asked me for trust... So I gave it. Kevin, he drew the cutest picture today. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. it had the three of us in it. who is that? I don't know. Some random number that's been calling me the last couple of weeks. Probably a telemarketer or something. Kevin, telemarketers don't call three times in a row. Answer the phone. Hello? Yeah, this is Kevin hunter. I'm her manager. Word... Let me talk to her and I'll get back to you. That was some producer... Denmar, something. Debmar? Yeah. Debmar. They want to give you a talk show. Kevin, they've been leaving messages at the station for two weeks, and you haven't called them back? You're my manager now! I'm becoming a real business and I've been trusting you to take care of all of that... But you've got no respect for time, no respect for protocol. You show up to meetings late all the time, and you wear sunglasses at night. I mean, who the hell are you, corey hart? Yo, calm down. I got this. You can't get hype every time tv calls. They've been calling since you did that pilot with monique and none of them have come correct. We're not doing some panel show, no "the view" co-hosting mess. Let's see what these dudes are talking about. But as far as I'm concerned, either they give you your own show or there's no deal. anacondas... Um... The big ass. These are the things I want to talk about... Keep it clean for the kids, but, you know, they're at school, so who cares? We like it raw and hardcore, right? Right? I know you like that. Uh-huh. Turn a red right there. You see who I'm with, right? "tell it like it is"... That's what I intend to bring to life on screen. In-person celebrity interviews. "their business is our business." yes! green light, yep! Go, go, go! We got an order for five shows a week for 30 episodes... Daytime talk show featuring, uh... Yeah, you know it... Just Wendy. Hey, joanna? How are the bookings looking for episode one? I mean, we're only three weeks from air and we're running out of time, I need the update. Well, we are having some trouble securing guests for the inaugural episodes. With all your controversy over the years, people are... How to say it... Unsure? 'kay. You know, without me, half of these motherf... Wouldn't even have a platform to talk their sh..., and now they want to boycott my show? You know, millions of people turn on their radios every single day, across the country, to listen to me, right? You know, what if I don't even need guests to make my stuff hot? That's right. You're the star. People come for you. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I'll focus on the audience... The people who read my book, my connection to them. The people who listen to me! Sounds fantastic. Kevin! Oh, my god. We have our own show! Whatcha gonna call it? "hot topics." hot topics. Hot topics. Wendy Williams. - I like that stuff. - Yes! I love it! Soon enough, a whole new audience... A national audience... Most of which had never heard of Wendy Williams... Started to watch my show. Oh, my god. My parents were proud of me. I had everything I ever wanted. I had a tv show where I could connect to people, and by the end of the year, we were picked up for two additional seasons. I got to be a mommy, I had my family, and it was so, so amazing. Yeah, it was. Oh! But you know what, I was so busy focusing on doing the work and enjoying the fruits of my labor that I was ignoring, and actually tolerating how Kevin had gotten bolder and more brazen with his reckless behavior... I took my eye off the balls. hi. Hey. Did you close the garage door? huh? I was handling some business at the fort lee apartment. You mean the club house where you keep your hoodlum friends and ho's? Everything I do is for you, Wendy. My life is protecting you. You don't even see it. You don't see when these dudes try to get at you, do you? Nah. Because I'm protecting you. Can't even pour me a glass of wine. Okay, that's enough waiting. Kevin will get here when he gets here. Oh, Kevin. Take a seat, please. Oh... Another sports watch. Actually, that's for you. be careful, you'll break the table. f... the table. my bad, Wendy. Just picking up something for Kevin. You still working? Come on in. Have a seat, ryan. you want a drink? I'm good. Are you okay, Wendy? 'cause... You know I care bout you. I'm great. You know, I'm just happy. Me and kev, we've been through a lot. And despite everything he's done to me... I do love him. And I think we're in a good space. And I just want to say that you're a part of it... And I really appreciate how you've been such a good part of our lives and in making my happiness happen. He is in l.A., right? He's in miami with... with nikki. Who's nikki? You know her? Her name is sharina hudson, but she goes by "nikki". She's one of the model girls y'all be having at parties and stuff. That's his other girl. What, they live together in the condo in fort lee? I knew fort lee was the hangout spot. I figured that they might have all been doing dirt there, but what he said next I wasn't ready for. Nah, they live in a house. In jersey. Not far from y'all place, actually. But wait... You've been there before? So this is a house, not an apartment? Is there, like, a chandelier, ryan? I've... I've been there before. You know, kev has the guys meet there all the time. She be walking around like she own the place, you know, like she is ms. Hunter, bringing us wings and henny. I be looking at my dude, like, "kev, man, how you gon' be out here looking like this when you got queen Wendy at home?" what's the address? I need the address, ryan. Ryan. What's the address? Okay. We don't want Kevin to know that you blew his cover, so sit low, duck down. I'm going in. sleep with a married man... I'll show you. Really, Kevin? My god, what is the mortgage on this place? To think you've got chandeliers. Oh, my god, you've got a pool? you always said that you'd give me one. The son of a bitch has dogs! With my money! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Leaving the garage door open. and that was the final straw. I needed something to ease the pain. And after making several phone calls, I was on my way to getting to the bottom of everything. Kevin had purchased the house in his business name. People thought I knew. To be clear, I did not. I see you've been to my investment property. Oh, so that's what we're calling the place where you stash your whore? You're lucky you didn't get arrested. The police were there when I got there. My neighbors called. I'm lucky I didn't get arrested? Oh, hell, no, I'm not throwing my stuff. Why don't you go grab some of your raggedy crap from your other house for me to throw? Or you know what, better yet, Kevin... Just get out! Yeah. Just get out of my house! Get out! Just get out! Please, just... Please get out. Please, just go. - Wendy. - No. Come on. Get away! Kevin! I wanted to end it then, but our son had two more years before he went off to college. I said to myself, stay strong and wait for your moment. But that wait was long and hard. show me a woman whose husband moves his side-piece into a home less than 10 miles away from yours who doesn't start downing some wine and I'll show you a liar. Welcome back. It's time for our how you "boo-ing" Halloween co... costume contest. We do it every year, it's always a lot of fun, so let's get started. Our first carest... medic! Medic! You just fainted, that's all. how are you feeling, baby? More pretty, young assistants, huh? You sleeping with them, too? I love you, Wendy. I was worried about you. Our son saw you drop to the ground on tv. I think you need some help. Why don't we take you to one of those fancy places, clean up your soul and spirit? I don't want you to start using again... I would never use again. You better watch out, Kevin. Don't push me on this, 'cause if you test me, you will lose me. I know you're mad. People are talking about you at the show. People are afraid for their jobs. There are rumors that we're gonna get canceled. I've never missed more than one day of work, and I don't plan on starting today. Everyone thinks... That you need some time off. Do it for our son. and that is how the man convinces you that you're the problem, that you're the one that needs help. While I was shuttled off to rehab, I knew there were headlines I shouldn't be missing. Oh, um, excuse me. Yeah. Hi. What can I do for you, Wendy? You can give me back my cell phone. We have been asked that we do not allow you to have a cell phone. Was it my husband? You need to rest and relax and have a break from all that. You cannot have a cell phone, media of any kind, or access to a tv. No, but I need to know what's going on in the world. I mean, I have absolutely no idea what people are saying. Wendy, you know it triggers you. If you see that stuff, you will want to drink. Didn't you say your mother was a fan? Wait, what? Oh, my god, Kevin. She's... She's pregnant. He's having a baby with her. yeah, it's me. How did I get a phone? Because I'm smarter than you. Now, I know that I agreed to stay here in florida for a hot minute, but a few things have come to my attention, and it is no longer tenable. Number one... Our show is falling apart because of all the bad press about me. I mean, sponsors are dropping out. Do you want that? I mean, this is our livelihood. We could lose everything! Yeah. So get me the hell out of here and book me a plane ticket back to new york! Because I gotta save my show. Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine, yes. I agree to continue rehab. I cannot and I will not let my show go down the toilet! You bastard. Get me out of here. these two guys were hired to take me from the sober house in queens, where I was living, to the studio for work, and back again every day. They watched my every move. I agreed to this in order to save my show... But I had a couple of tricks up my sleeve. First was to take back the narrative of my own life. I've been living in a sober house. I go there every day after work. Lights out by 10:00. And then I come back to see you all again the very next day. So that is my truth. It's a very, um... Regimented place, very sterile, very weird, but... A good place... For me to... Gather my thoughts and myself. So. Hi. - I'm Wendy. - Hi, Wendy. I'm not an alcoholic. My husband of nearly 20 years is having a baby with... His mistress. we just want you to be happy, Wendy. That's what we've always wanted. We want you to be healthy. Kevin's been worried about you, and I know Kevin jr. Is gonna try to come see you as well. No. What did he tell you? You shouldn't be here. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Everybody has problems. We are not judging you. I knew what I had to do. I secretly assembled my team. Next, somehow, I had to actually get myself there. okay, can we hurry up? I'm going to be late for my meeting. Just cut across and take third all the way down. It's faster. Yeah, we don't think it's good idea for you go to this meeting today. We don't think you're in he right head space, so we're taking you straight back to the sober house right away. It's just my will being tweaked. We'll reschedule it for you. hey, Wendy! Wendy! I had everyone assembled and ready to take action... My accountants, lawyers, business managers, estate planners... All there to help me reclaim my life. Hello, everyone. How you doing? Thank you so much for this. Caviar, my favorite. Mm! Okay! Let's get me legally and financially free from Kevin hunter, and then all I'm going to need is a divorce. We're doing this. It's after 10:00 p.M. Who let you in here? I just need to talk to you. Security! Security! Hello! No. Who let him in here? - Wendy... - Because I want him out of here. He is your guardian and medical proxy. No. He's making me sick. Because I'm the one whose health is on the line and he is making me ill. I mean, he's killing me. He is emotionally, mentally, and physically destroying me. Wendy, we think it would be healthy for your recovery for you and Kevin to talk. - yeah, okay. - we're all here for you. Uh-huh. You need to comply with your treatment. Whatever. I need to talk to you. Oh, about what, huh? The studio you rented for that little thing, sharina, so she can live out her stylist pipe-dreams? Or about the house that you're keeping her in? Or about all the cars that you bought that we can't afford... Or should I say, that you can't afford... Mm-hmm... Because we all know whose money is being spent here. You know, the only reason why anyone entertains yo ass is because you're Wendy Williams' husband. Because I'm the one who's up every morning at 6:00 a.M. Hosting the talk show to pay for your flashy-ass lifestyle, and you've got me up in here... Calling me a pill-popping alcoholic... And a bad mom, and a bad daughter, and a boss who's on the verge of a breakdown. Mm-hmm. Now, you're here to tell me that she's had your baby. Was it healthy? Yeah. Was it a boy or a girl? It was a girl. A baby girl. Wendy, stop acting like you don't have a problem. I see you. This isn't all about me... You're not happy, you're never satisfied. Look at what I built us, and you want to throw it all away? You can lie to yourself all you want, but I know and you know you got a problem. Yeah, well, before I had you, I had me. And not you, nor anyone else, have the power to take away my gifts. Yeah, you almost broke me, Kevin. But you failed. Mm-hmm. And we are getting a divorce. Yeah. The paperwork's on your desk. So I suggest that you get a lawyer, because who I am puts food on your table. And, honey, you will starve without me. - Wendy... - no. I know things have been turbulent over the last several months, and I apologize to you all. Going forward, Kevin hunter is no longer a producer or part of the "the Wendy Williams show" in any way. The middle man is gone. Now I'm in charge. Now, I hope you all will continue to have faith and believe even more in the magic of what we do here every day. Let's get to it, because I've got way too many exciting plans for the future. I'm back! About to be zipping and zooming because... I'm about to be a single lady! Whoo-whoo! Whoo-whoo... Whoo-whoo! okay, I did say it, and I did mean it. Now it's time to party... And you are all invited. Whoo-whoo! Whoo-whoo!! After everything that happened, you know what I realized? Parents, siblings, friends, colleagues, the world at large... I was always trying to make them proud. Now, finally... I'm proud of me. Thank you for everything that you do and for being who you are... Because, together, we will get through anything. Wow. You know, I want to thank you for sharing my journey with me. As a little girl growing up, all of my life, I've always had a plan. The first big plan was to get out of my parents' house. The life that I live right now is bigger than I could ever dream. Regrets? I have none. It took all those mistakes to get me right here, to this purple chair, backstage. I got one question for you. How you doing?
