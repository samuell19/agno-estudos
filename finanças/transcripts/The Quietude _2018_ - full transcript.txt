More so, at some level, you even want me to. Yes. I can't believe this. You'd better, because it's true. What? Could you be less romantic? Here? Are you going to proclaim your love in your father's office? How many times were we together in Paris? Doesn't it seem to you like a more suitable place to proclaim your love? But I really like what you've done with the office. I think it looks nice. It has a López Falbo touch. Elegant and a bit romantic. Yes, it looks really nice, congratulations. Thanks, Mía. - Shall we? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Well... You like him, don't you? No way. He's been in love with you He got better with age. I can't stand him. I think he's stupid.

Until one day, Augusto came in. Yes, and I forgot about everything else. That same day I fell in love with him and he fell in love with me. I always had to write so many powers of attorney, you know? I would always run into him. Mom, we already know how you met Dad. There's something I don't understand. Why does the lawsuit against Nicanor affect us? You were already living in Paris by that time. That's why Eugenia was born there, right? We moved to Europe in 1979, right? And came back in 1984, once the military government was over. - The dictatorship, Mom. - Mía, again? Don't you think that's an important detail? I guess it isn't free to move to Paris all expenses paid by a government that's, Tell me, do you want to have this conversation now? I do want to have this conversation now. ESMERALDA: Listen to me, I can't believe you. Why do you think it might be so revealing, something you keep repeating since you were 20? Talking about things is always revealing, Mom. Are you going to tell me what the truth means? [THUNDER RUMBLES] This is another one of your spoiled-brat scenes. And at this time we have to be united. Is that understood? Our family has to be united. Are you going to talk about unity, Mom? You make me laugh, I'm sorry. Stop laughing then, because we have to be united so that we can think this through. Do you realize how serious your father's condition is? - Are you aware or not? - I'm aware of everything. Stop it! [THUNDER RUMBLES] Stop it. My apologies, Vincent. I'm going to have to leave because I can't stand to keep arguing with this girl. - Good night. - Good night. Shit. It's good, right?

[HEART MONITORS BEEPING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BALLAD PLAYING] ESMERALDA: Thanks for your help, Vincent. No, it's a pleasure to be here. In spite of it all, - Thank you. - [MUSIC DISTORTS, RESUMES] I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - And I'm so sorry about Eugenia. All those years trying they said she couldn't get She wanted it so badly. She wanted it so much. [MUSIC STOPS, RESUMES] She would beg for us to keep trying. She wanted to be a mother She knew just how much We were all pregnant. We were all expecting that baby. Tragedy tends to bring more tragedy. Euge had a phantom pregnancy, Mom. That's a medical condition, not a tragedy. You have no right to speak Specially not about other people's medical conditions. [MUSIC STOPS, RESUMES] - Thank you. - Thank you. [MUSIC DISTORTS, RESUMES] Good afternoon. Thanks for everything, I have Thank you so much. There's nothing to thank me for, Esmeralda. Nothing. You have to sign this paper so that they can keep him there. [GROANS] Everything okay with Dad? Yes. He's still at They were really nice, they'll keep him for as long as you need until you can continue with the ceremony. No extra charge, you don't Maybe they'll need to put a bit of makeup on him, that's all. RAQUEL: Excuse me. Thank you. I'm sorry. [MUSIC DISTORTS, RESUMES] Thank you. Me too. Thank you. Why do you thank me? I meant, you're welcome. When should we pick him up from there? Don't worry, that's no problem. He's okay there. They're going to take good care of him. They have state-of-the-art refrigerators. He'll be fine. Really, I have no words [MUSIC STOPS] For fuck's sake! [SIGHS] [RINGING] Raquel! Raquel! - Is it good? - Very good. - You want some? - I'm starving, to be honest. - Help yourself. - Help yourself. Thanks. You're welcome. MIA: You're welcome. What about Euge? Any news? It looks like They'll be moving her - That's good. - That's good. - Thank God. - ESTEBAN: But I don't get it. Is it possible for a phantom pregnancy to produce the image of a baby on a sonogram? No. She never had a sonogram done. ESTEBAN: Really? No. So how did you know she was pregnant? Eugenia took a pregnancy test. Ah. And can it test positive? That's what the doctors said. If she had had a blood test done, it would have tested negative. Hmm. It's hard to understand, right? Hard to understand and hard to explain. Like any other psychological disorder. That doesn't mean my sister is crazy. Hmm. ESMERALDA: Sure. What were you and Euge when Mía started to feel bad? What? It's just that I saw her go to him and start crying Mm-hmm. - Eh. - Hmm. Actually... I was sharing one of my memories about Augusto. And she got a little emotional, poor thing. - That was silly of me. - It must have been that. What? She hadn't cried at all before that moment. - Did she cry with you? - No. My daughter is such an introvert. That's why it was weird that she opened up with you. I found it weird too. But it looks like [ALL MURMURING] ESTEBAN: I want to make a toast for Augusto. To Augusto. Cheers. ALL: Cheers. [MOANING IN DISTANCE] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING CONTINUES] [BREATHING WHEEZILY] [BOTH MOANING, GRUNTING] [MOANING CONTINUES] Look at me. [CRYING] VINCENT: Forgive me. Forgive me, love. Forgive me. Forgive me. Look at me, look at me. VINCENT: I want to ask her if she really felt pregnant, or if she had been lying to me the whole time. MIA: How could she lie about such a thing? Eugenia lies about lots of things. [SIGHS] EUGENIA: - I really felt a baby VINCENT: But it wasn't real. And it never will be. This will be good for us. Yes, you're right. But let's not grow apart. [CRYING] [SPOON CLANKING] ESMERALDA: Will Vincent be long? I don't know, he likes to sleep. Does he? I'm just saying that because you also sleep with him, don't you? Don't you? Stay out of this, Mom. ESMERALDA: It's the truth, baby. Stay out of it. He'll miss his flight. [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [WOMAN VOCALIZING] Hi, girls. Good morning. JUDGE: Good morning, with this we'll open the hearing. Your name, ma'am. ESMERALDA: Esmeralda Jáuregui de Montemayor. JUDGE: You've been summoned here to testify on case number 40320 where Mr. López Falbo is on trial. I advise you that the criminal code penalizes people who are deceptive or do not answer with the truth. According to your beliefs, do you swear to tell the truth? Yes, I swear. JUDGE: Mr. Prosecutor, your witness. PROSECUTOR: Thank you very much. I request Your Honor's permission to show the witness some documents. JUDGE: Go ahead. PROSECUTOR: Are you aware of the way those property deeds were signed? Yes. The sellers gave my husband a power of attorney certified by Nicanor López Falbo. PROSECUTOR: The signatures on these documents, do they belong to the owners of these properties? - Yes. PROSECUTOR: - So the people providing actually signed the documents at López Falbo's clerk's office? ESMERALDA: No. PROSECUTOR: But these deeds were signed at the clerk's office? Yes. And were the property owners present at that moment? No. Why? Because the property owners were unable to come to the office. That's why they all signed a power of attorney. So that their representative could sign for them. Why? Because they were in custody. [CROWD GASPS] Were they in prison? No. Where were they? At the ESMA. [CROWD MURMURING] The Navy School of Mechanics. Correct. They were in the ESMA's basement. And did these detainees sign of their own free will? No. They were forced to. They were told that if they or their families would be. Ma'am, how do you know all this? Because I was López Falbo's secretary. PROSECUTOR: And he'd send you to have those papers signed? ESMERALDA: No way. PROSECUTOR: Do you know who would go to the ESMA to collect those signatures? Yes. PROSECUTOR: Who? - My husband. - [CROWD MURMURING] PROSECUTOR: Counselor Augusto Montemayor? ESMERALDA: Yes. [MIA & EUGENIA YELLING INDISTINCTLY] [YELLING GROWS LOUDER] MIA: Why did you make that shit up, Mom? EUGENIA: Please leave her alone. I won't! I want her That shit is the truth. I won't stop! Listen to her! Come on, tell us! There are lots of things you don't know about your father. MIA: Well, then, tell me. Are you going to say that Dad would throw people out of planes? - Come on, tell me. - Sit down! I had my mouth shut for decades to protect you from this shit you want to know about now. Decades! That father you worship so much... when we came back from Paris the first time... held me hostage in my own home... in my own matrimony, do you understand? He forced me to have sex without consent. Over and over. - He raped me! - What are you saying, Mom? He'd tie you to the bed? How did he rape you? Listen to what That's how I got pregnant with you. He forced me to go through with the pregnancy. And ever since the first day, I wanted it to stop... but I couldn't do it alone, no.... I couldn't have an abortion. And when you were born... I kept thinking everything was going to change. I'd be like any other mother who has that special love for her child, but I never did. Not one day, not one instant. Never. I went from... feeling sad to hating myself. I didn't know what to do, it was terrible. It was like a dark cloud chasing after me. It was torture, Mía, torture. Really. And then your dad... started taking care of you. And feeding you, because I couldn't. I couldn't because.... [SOBBING] I couldn't lift you up, nor hold you... nor breastfeed you or anything. I didn't want to touch you. And then... I decided to accept it and act natural about it. But it never happened. I barely loved you, Mía. Do you know how terrible and feel like it's no one, like it's nothing? And call a person you barely know "daughter." All that thanks to your father, your adored father. You and this misfortune And I swear... I swear... I swear that I tried. But... But I couldn't love you. I just couldn't. I don't know... I couldn't. I do love you. But I... But... I tried to. I tried to. I was desperate, but I tried, I tried. NAVY SCHOOL OF MECHANICS ESTEBAN: In those days, kindness took the shape of favors. You asked for favors, you returned favors. There were favors that required certified signatures. My father took care of that, and yours as well. Now, she would go to the ESMA to see these people. Your mother took their - But is the book real? - Yes, of course. Of course. My father said it was at the office, but it was missing. Where did you find it? It was in the briefcase my dad But he never This puts your mother in a very complicated position. Do what you have to do. I don't get it. I don't get what your mother did. Honestly... I don't get it. In here there's her name, her last name, her signature. Explain it to me because I don't get it. She should stay there, enjoy life and stop messing around. [CHUCKLING] Imagine your mother in prison. Just imagine that. No one's going to do anything for her. No more ringing the bell. I mean... What did you do? What had to be done. Without asking me? If I had, what would you have done? - I don't know. - So? Do you realize we are going You're not a kid anymore, Mía. - To stand up for Dad, Euge. - I can't believe this. How will you pay your bills? - How will I pay mine? - I don't know. I don't know, Euge. I don't know. [SCOFFS] [DOGS BARKING] MAN: Let me give you a hand. Stay calm. Stay calm. It'll be okay. I'll [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] If you need me, just have them call me. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINES STARTS, REVS] [PANTING] Hey! - No. - No, no. [CLICKS TONGUE] [WHINES] Pancho! No! Come here. [WHINING] That's it. [MURMURS INDISTINCTLY] [BARKING] I never understood why, of all the men in the world, you had to pick Vincent. You knew how much I loved him. I used to tell you everything. - I didn't pick him. - [SCOFFS] Vincent was my schoolmate. My friend. And you started And when you had to because you were 16, make a choice, And things turned out [ENGINE STOPS] No, things didn't turn out like this, Euge. Someone decided it to be that way. [CAR BEEPING] I've known about you two for 15 years, Mía. Fifteen years. Ever since the first time you saw each other in Marseille, when he came back with the smell of your perfume, I knew it. But I never told you. Not you nor him. Why? What would Every time I knew you were Every time you came I knew that at some point you were going to be together. But why did you never say anything? Because... Because I never felt Because you know Relief. Knowing that I share him Knowing that I can give you makes me feel good. I never asked him to leave you. For me too, it's a way to be close to you. [CRYING] I miss you so much! I know. The distance is too real, too painful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [KISSES] Easy. Even if we speak every day, I miss you just the same. I think about you every day. I swear I want to be okay. I want to, but I just can't. I don't know how to... [KISSES] Poor thing. You poor thing.
