Just before D-Day, there were over three million Americans in Britain. And this is a record of what happened to one of them. Sergeant John Patterson of the United States Army Air Force of Flagstaff, Arizona, Here he is amongst the unfamiliar background but familiar faces of Grosvenor Square, known to all arms of the United States Services as Eisenhower Platz. And here's his sidekick, Sergeant Benjamin MacGregor Greenburg of Brooklyn, New York. This is it. Do not knock or ring, enter, fair enough. Can't be. This is it all right. What do you guys want? We're supposed to be billeted here. Let's see your cards. Sure. Temporary duty for a while. Okay, second floor for you two, You'll see your name outside the door. I'm down here if anybody wants me. Stringer's the name, house orderly. And wipe your feet outside when you come in, All right, all right. Say Stringer, tell me what's the layout here? We got this whole place? Just the upper floors. Bathroom facilities limited and 50's the hot water. 80 watch the five inch mark on the bathtub. And go easy on the soap, it's an heirloom. Never use it. So this is the Army, Mr. Jones, Boy this is gonna be something. Just like home. Yes, so different, Makes you feel downright expensive. Johnnie. Yeah but it's got something, Benji. Well, this is more like it. You ain't kiddin'. I'll take the brunette. This can't be Air Force, it's too neat. Huh, we'll fix that. Brr, kind of cow, No steam heat here? The British don't believe in it Benji, you know that. That's the trouble with some of them. They never even get thawed out. What a dame. Could I go for her with both hands. That's probably why they've got her covered up to keep her away from wolves like you. I notice you was right on the beam. Lady Patricia Fairfax, Eh. Johnnie, the lights don't work. How do you like that? No lights, no steam heat, no butler. Eh, Stringer! Wait a minute. I'll take care of that little sourpuss. Butch, you stay here and make up the beds. I'll find out where chow is. See you later. What are you doing here? I'm baking for someone, This is private property. The upper part of this residence is reserved for the American Army, The ground floor and basement are still reserved for the family. I hope we didn't push you out. You've done nothing of the kind. His Grace has kindly consented to the use of his London residence for the duration of the war. His Grace? The Duke of Exmoor. Are you the... I am His Grace's housekeeper. Well I'm John Patterson. I'm attached... I am not interested in what you are attached to. Your orderly, Stringer, has strict instructions. Well that's the guy I'm looking for, Stringer. He takes his meals at North Audley Street, Lord Marcus Logan's place. You will probably find him there. Thanks. You know, we've got no light upstairs. The electric current is turned off until half an hour after sunset. Well, what do you know about that? I know nothing whatever about it. Will you be good enough to take your absence? That's a new one on me, Ma'am, but I'll be glad to take it. Please do. Well thanks very much. It's been nice seeing you. Excuse me, I've come to tune the piano. Oh yes, You see that door, go through that, down the steps and you'll find a dame that loves Americans. Just tell her you're from Pittsburgh and you'll have the time of your er, am came ham Peckham. Eh, not in there, Pop. What's that? That's private property. Oh, thanks for the tip. I think I'll risk it. Irrespective of race, rank, colour or nationality, First come first served, and I saw him first. Okay, go ahead. Which way are you going? Tower Hill. Well I'm going to the bank. Jump in, it's on my way. No, I'll get there, go on. No go on, jump in. I'll get used to it I suppose. But I still think it's kind of crazy the way the traffic drives on the wrong side of the street over here. It goes back to the time when we were a little lees friendly than we are today and men rode on the left hand side of the road so they could have their right hand free to grab their sword or their pistol. That's not so dumb after all. You been here long? In London? ** Made many friends? None. Pity. Oh, we've got our own crowd over here, There's some of them there now, look. Yeah. You may not believe it but that form a London crowd is what they call a hysterical demonstration. Is that so? Come over to win this war, eh mate? We've got some of his kind back here too, only ours are still talking about the war debts. It's nice of you to say that, Have you seen St. Pam's? Is it worth seeing? Some people think so. Driver, pull up for a minute, will you? There it is. St. Paul's. And all that damage? They dropped them there. And they dropped them there. They dropped them practically everywhere. And they couldn't hit it. No, they couldn't hit it. That kind of gets you, doesn't it? Yes. My name is John Patterson, what's yours? David Bruce. All right, driver. So you're off to the bloody tower, No I've seen the bloody tower. I'm going to Tower Hill where William Penn was born. The new one on me. That's perfectly natural I suppose, You Just take those things for granted the same way we do it in the United States. That's about it. Oh, here we are, I say, let me get some of this. No, no, it's all right. No, it was on my way. That's nice of you, thanks a lot, Come and have a drink with me one night at my club, Nash's in James's Street, You'll find me there about six. Say, I'd like to do that. - Nash's on St. James's Street. - That's it. - Thank you. - Not a bit. Cheerio. - Cheers. - Cheers! Good luck. A Mr. Patterson, sir. Who, Bates? Patterson, an American gentleman. Oh yes, of course, Who is it? An American I met yesterday. An American, oh. Hello Dickie, I thought you were in Scotland. Nine days. Lucky man. Hello. How do you do, sir? You see, I took you at your word. Yes, come on. You found your way all right? Oh yes, they sort of passed me over from cop to cop. Sergeant Patterson, Lieutenant Craig, Lieutenant Richards. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? How do you do? Sit down. Thank you. What do you drink? Can I have a scotch and soda? Hmm, rather. Bates? - Sir? - Scotch and soda please. Whiskey and splash, very good sir. Well, you found Tower Hill all right? Oh yes, thanks to you. How was it? ** I got quite a kick out of it. I found him trying to orientate himself in Chancery Lane, This your first time in London? Yes. You haven't been here before? No. This is your first time here then? Yes. Oh. Ah here we are, say when. That's fine, thanks. My pleasure. Cheers, good luck, Good luck. Do you know a friend of mine, a fellow called O'Hara? O'Hara? Well... As a matter of fact he's a friend of my wife's. She met him in the south of France or somewhere. He's an American. Where was he from? Oh, New York I think, Or was it Chicago? No, I don't behave I know mm. Oh just wondered, you being an American too. Where have they put you here? Shh. This is the BBC Home Service. Here is the news and this is Alvar Lidell reading it. Nothing fresh has come in from the fighting fronts since our last bulletin. The Minister of Information... Come to think of it, I believe it was San Francisco he came from. You don't know him? Well you see, America's a pretty big place. Yes, I suppose so. You must think our ideas of America are rather quaint. Well Major, some of our officials seem to think that we have pretty quaint ideas of England and, it's all very nicely served up to us in a lime pink book. Most people get used to the English climate eventually. Huh, eventually. Get a load of this. The British have phrases and colloquialisms of their own which may sound funny to you. It is not a good idea for instance to say bloody in mixed company in Britain. And to say I look like a bum to the British, this means that you look like your own backside. Well it only goes to show as George Bernard Shaw said, "There's nothing divides nations like a common language." And that Irishman should know. Here's something, Johnny. Whenever you get the chance to do a kind, polite, considerate act, do it and get on with your job. Anybody'd think we was an army of occupation or something. Maybe we are at that. Imagine Rockefeller being kicked out of his bedroom for a bunch of limies. Aw, that's different, Allow me, mom. I can manage my own things, thank you. And don't call me mom. How dare you. Yes, but I did say, allow me, didn't I, ma'am? I am perfectly capable of carrying my own parcels, thank you. Now of course you are, But you see I've Just been reading the little pink book, so don't thank me. Now I've just had a parcel from home, perhaps you'd like for me to... Thank you, we have all we need. Oh I've got some butter and sugar. No, I don't need it. Neither do I. Okay, Ma'am, What's biting you? Nothing's biting me. I don't like strangers. You mean you don't like strangers or you Just don't like Americans? Put it which way you like. Do you know anything about Americans? I believe they're supposed to have won the last war. Well you must admit, we did help a bit. I mt my husband at Mons. I lost my dad at Chateau Thierry. What do you say, Ma'am, we just bury the last war and win this one? Wilson, I've brought us some tomatoes. Oh your Grace, how did you manage it? My tobacconist has an aunt who knows a man in Sheperd Market. Oh, good afternoon. Good afternoon, sir. Are you one of my paying guests? Well in a way, yes sir. He carried my parcels for me, Oh, most kind. I think we've met before. Yes, I think we have, sir. Thank you. Would you like some tea? Well, thank you. Wilson, cup for our friend. Air Force, eh? Yes, Sergeant John Patterson is my name, sir, How are you getting on, John? Well, at the moment, Fm grounded but then I expect to be back on operations in a few weeks now. I'm a waist-gunner. A waist-gunner? Oh yes, yes of course, a waist-gunner, And how do you like London? Well I think it's a very interesting city, sir. Yes it is, isn't it? Though of course there's nothing quite as beautiful as the countryside when you're lying above it. It looks like a garden, sir. You like gardens? Indeed I do, sir. Now let me see. There are one or two things you ought to see in London, Well you know I thought this afternoon I'd go over and take a look at Westminster Abbey. You couldn't be better. I go there for the coronations, but I can't say I've ever seen it properly, Oh, thank you Wilson, No thanks. What was that you called me when we met? When, sir? When you warned me about coming in here. Oh, then sir? Was it Pop? That's it, Pop. You know I didn't really mean... Ooh I like it. You call me Pop. Don't tell Wilson I asked you to. Okay sir, C.O. is waiting for you in the mess, sir. Thank you Corporal. Then I'm to drive you to the Orderly Room, sir, Oh, that will be nice. Would you mind taking one of these? Any other Army arrived yet? Some Officers arrived in a DOS about 10 minutes ago, sir. What sort? A Lieutenant Colonel and a Brigadier. A fat Brigadier? Well, plump, sir. Ah, Brigadier Mallet from the War Office. ** Really, sir? Busy down here? Yes, pretty busy, sir. Suits you, ? Thank you sh. Roses in the cheeks, sparkles in the eye, very attractive. You know, I wouldn't mind being stationed down here. It's a lovely reception staff. The Mess is there, sir. Hmm? Ah, yes, there we are, boys. Hello, darling. David, what in the world are you doing here? I've come for a nice conference. How are you, Pat? I'm fine, this is wonderful. Luck, isn't it? ** not seeing you all that time. Now I shall go back oozing sweetness and light. Oh, David. Get leave quickly, darling, I'll make mine coincide. We must meet soon. Oh we must, darling, Where did you say the mess was? Over here, sir, Thanks, Corporal. Thank you, sir. No, no, no, this is Mrs. Catchpole. I want the Station Master. Yes. Station Master? Two American guests are arriving on the 2:35 train. No, not gentlemen, Sergeants, Parker's meeting them. Will you're him to put them down at the lodge gates where his Grace is trimming the hedge? Thank you. Mildred, I think you ought to come along. One of your ducks seems to be ill. It's behaving in a most curious manner. That must be Hitler again. He's been carrying on in a strange way for the last few days, Touch of cramp. - 342. - Certainly making odd noises. - Patricia? - Yes? You know that your grandfather invited two Americans down to spend the day. You will have to out your tennis short and help me entertain them. ** on a 24 hour pass? Speaking in French: "C'est la guerre". Got your ticket? ** I believe you are the two gentlemen I am to collect. Oh yes, sir, thank you. Is he the Duke? I'm Parker sir, His Grace's butler, Thank you. That's a nice pony you've got there. What is it, Cornish? No sir, Welsh. Rather like a Cornish. Mrs, Catchpole uses her a lot nowadays. She's a fine old girl, we call her Queenie. I get it, the sociable type, huh? It's the pony we call Queenie, sir. The rug sir? No thanks, Parker. - I'll take those. - Thank you. Whoa, pony. So this is the surrie without the fringe on top, huh? We call it a trap, sir. And keep yours shut. I'm to put you down here, sir. You'll find his Grace on the other side of the hedge. He's doing a little trimming. Thanks, Parker. Hey listen, listen, listen Butch. Straighten your tie. All right, all right. Brush yourself off, Throw away that stage, you got to look suck when you're meeting dukes. Hello, sir. Oh there you are, John, Just the fellow I want. What do you think of that? Kind of a hedge, huh sir? Of course it's a hedge, Nothing else strike you? Certainly, it's been blitzed! What? Oh, this is my friend Sergeant Greenberg. He's also one of your paying guests, How do you do? How do you do, Duke? Doesn't remind you of a peacock, I suppose? Well, no sir. Should it? Well it used to be 3 peacock before I started to trim it a bit. Mrs. Catchpole's gardeners have been called up. That used to be a peacock too but the tau died this morning so I turned it into a peahen. You may be in for a bit of trouble there, sir, You ain't kidding? But I don't think we'll say anything to Mrs. Catchpole. She's apt to be a bit fussy, Your secret is safe with us, sir. There they are. Good service. Hello, shan't be long. No hurry. Major Bruce. Yes, that's my granddaughter. Who, the Colonel? No, not that one, that one. The Colonel's my cousin. Mrs. Catchpole. A good soul, but a bit organising. I know the type. You have them in your country? Do we. We got them all over the joint. Very good you know and does excellent work but after you, Do you play tennis, Mr. Greenberg? Tennis, me? No, no, baseball is Benji's game. Sure, that's a he-man's game, you know, hitting and pitching. Sit down. Are you a hitter? No, I'm a fan. A fan? Yeah I sit in the first row behind third base. Oh, a spectator. No, no he really means a fan, sir, You see there's a big difference between a fan and a spectator, particularly in Brooklyn. Sure, anybody knows that. I'm afraid I'm rather ignorant of the finer points of the game. You will have to explain them to me sometime. Sure. Sure. Yes well I'll go and see about our lea. So this is England, eh? You know Benji, this is that 100 percent war effort that we've heard so much about. Peacocks. Yep. Tennis. Fussy women Colonels. No wonder the folks back home was 3 phones war. Uh-uh, you know what you says in the little pink book about knocking the British. And I wonder what that cute little babe out there is doing about it? A wing commander I met told me I played tennis beautifully. Well darling, you are beautiful and you play tennis, Mrs, I doesn't think it's my game either. Why don't you come into politics with me? Harder hitting, there's less running about. No, darling, when you're an MP I could Just stand at the back and look after your racket. Wasn't that last word a little ambiguous? It's your mind, my sweet. You'd better be standing by when the election comes. I shall need a ball boy to collect the cabbages. Nobody will throw eggs nowadays, anyway. They might if I try hard enough, A Colonel's wife said the other day that I make delicious speeches. Well darling, you are delicious and you make speeches. 15 all. I should imagine so. - Hello, Patterson. - Hello, sir. Lady Patricia Fairfax, Sergeant Patterson. - How do you do. - How do you do? Oh, and Sergeant Greenberg, How do you do? Hi, lady Pat. - Hi. - Hiya. Sit down, would you? Well. How's Grosvenor Square? Fine, thank you. Hitler has laid an egg. Well it's about time. Mrs. Catchpole, Sergeant Patterson, How do you do? Sergeant Greenberg, How do you do, do sit down. Well I have to get changed for tea, Are you going back to Aldershot tonight, David? He's got to make a gesture towards winning the war. After all this terrible running about I should probably just put my feet up and go beautifully off. You should have come earlier and we could have had some good energetic doubles. Don't worry lady, now that we're here you'll soon be having energetic doubles over in Berlin. Won't that be nice. Radishes for tea, Mildred. Wilson never gives me radishes for tea, They're really delicious, aren't they? Do you have them in your country? ** heart and soul into this emotion we've got to get everything else tidied up first. Sugar? Yes. No, no, never touch the stuff. We have a bye election in our constituency in Devon, Mr. Patterson. Major Bruce is our candidate. It's a pity David hasn't my vocal chords. I've been addressing meetings for years and they stand up to any strain. Really Mildred, I am sure David would rather have his own vocal chords. Mr. Trethewy wants you on the telephone, ma'am. Oh, Richard, you'd better come along and speak to him. I'm having my tea. Well, bring it with you. Oh, really, Now the chief issues of David's policy are under three headings. First, the farmers, Then housing. What are you smiling at? I don't know. This isn't exactly what I thought. England would be like somehow. What isn't? Well all this. Mrs. Catchpole's energy, the Duke's radishes. Officers quitting the army to go into politics, I guess maybe the war hasn't changed things much over here, huh? You're a keen observer, Mr. Patterson. Well I don't. What pan of America do you come from? Flagstaff, Arizona, Is it wild and woolly? No, it's on the road to California. Oh really? I'm afraid that you would miss the grass and trees if you went out there. ** Just a blade or two. How dreary. I was going to America if the war had not started, to Florida. Uh huh, plenty of good tennis there, Is that so? Yes they tell me that the Rhumba bands out there are pretty good too. Too bad the war interfered. If you'll excuse me I shall have to go and change. It's the fourth of July, Abbot's Field. It's a double header between the Brooklyns and the Giants. The day's a hot day. People are all taking thew seats. Hot dogs, pop bottles, and then the ump walks on the field. That's when you came out with "Who let the bum in?" Just to make him feel good, see? And all the time you're drinking about six Coke homes and you put the bottles down between your legs like this. That's ammunition, see? And you put them there so the guy next to you can't cop them. Then the game starts. You're yelling and you're yelling and you're knocking yourself out and am the time you're telling the umpire there that there's 10,000 fans like you and they've all got six coke bottles and that's gonna make him think twice before he pulls any phoney decisions, That's why they call them the dodgers? No. It's psychology, ma'am. Good bye, Mildred, Going already, Patricia? Yes, I'm driving David over to the Pringles. Goodbye, goodbye, Good bye, Thanks over for a lovely weekend, Mrs. Catchpole. See you again soon, Patterson. I hope so, sir. Now don't forget, David, The secret of good public speaking is be kind to your diaphragm. Breathe like a sleeping child, yes I know. You ought to come up and see my Sergeant Major sometime. I don't suppose I'll see you again before the election, Corporal? No sir. I hope I get leave. Oh you must, Our new CO is pretty difficult. Well bring her along too. I could do with all the support I can get. David, you will win hands down. Hmm, I hope so. David, you've never contemplated leaving the Army if you get in? Are you serious? No. Extraordinary question. Is Arizona at the top or the bottom? Oh. About the middle I suppose, why? It doesn't matter. That makes even/thing perfectly clear, How are you getting to Aldershot? Jock Pringle's giving me a lift. What train are you getting back to town? 5:30. A bit early isn't it? Grandfather's putting young America on the 7:40, I've had enough of them for one day, If it's in line with military practise for a Sergeant to apologise to a Corporal, I'd just like to say that I'm sorry about knowing all the wrong answers. Well there's one wrong answer I'd like you to get right. Our officers don't quit the Army to go into parliament. If someone thinks he has anything worthwhile to say then he's given leave of absence to say it. After Dunkirk and Dieppe, Major Bruce thinks he has something worth saying. Yes I was afraid of that. Well it seems that I sure pulled a full house of boners this afternoon, didn't I? Well now let's forget it, Okay, Care to have a smoke? Oh thanks. Have one of mine. Sure. Thanks. You know in this country we're in deadly earnest about things that don't matter at all. And apparently not at all in earnest about things that matter a great deal. The sooner our visitors realise this amiable lunacy the better. I think you're right. Where are you stationed? In Hampshire. Would a letter addressed to just "Hampshire" reach you? I'm afraid not. If it's not a careless answer, what would? Well, no, everybody knows it, particularly Jerry. I'm at Langland Hill. Do you mind if I write to you? Not if you'd like to, ** Tell me, how do ** to a Duke's grand-daughter? Dear Patricia, or Pat. Dear Pat? Okay, What time does your train leave for Hampshire? 7:20. I'll take it. Have you got time for a cup of coffee? Coffee? Sure, a good cup of coffee too, What, in London? Well not exactly London. It's a bit of the United States over in Picadilly Circus. Where's that? Rainbow Corner, will you come? Well, I have time. Swell. Fellows, you know the legend, the old legend about the pot of gold being at the end of the rainbow? Well now that I'm here at Rainbow Corner I can see what they mean. I'd like to finish up with a little song, the sentiment of which I think is very near and dear to all of us. Home. # When shadows fall # # And dreams whisper day is ending # # My thoughts are ever wending home # # When lovers call # # My heart is forever yearning # # One's heart will be returning home # # When the hills conceal the setting sun # # Stars begin appearing # # One by one # # Night covers all # # And though fortune may forsake me # # Sweet dreams will ever take me # # Home # Thank you very much. Thank you very much fellows, I can't begin to tell you what a real thrill and privilege it is to sing to you. And I know that everyone who has come over to the ETC has found the same reaction. Your enthusiasm is a great inspiration to all of us. And I wanna say to each and every one of you wherever you go, whatever you do, godspeed and god bless you. And thanks. You've been swell. Well let's grab this table. Look you sit here and I'll get us some coffee. Sure. Oh wait a minute, fellows. This is the only dress I brought wnh me. You don't want me to do a Gyspy-Rose-Lee? I'm afraid I'm gong to have to disappoint you, Say wait a minute. Give me five minutes to change to my USO uniform and I'll come back and VII sign all your short snorters, your long snifters, even a plaster of Paris, how about it? A tittle bit of America in Piccadilly Circus. Hiya, Johnny. Hello, Frankie. One of our first members. What, of the American Air Force? No, the Goldfish club. What's that? The Goldfish dub? Well, that's, Oh what is it? Fish. Yes but what's it for? Swimming. Do Americans get decorated if you can swim? Well some of us do. I got this for swimming in the channel. What do you mean? Well we just didn't have engines enough to get home any other way, so, Oh you mean you came down in the Channel? Yeah. And you all got a fish? No, just two of us. The others didn't get back. Oh I'm sorry. I suppose that's what you call knowing all the wrong answers. Yeah, but we're forgetting all that, remember? # When shadows fall # # And dreams whisper day is ending # # My hearts are ever wending home # # When lovers call # # My heart is forever yearning # # Once more to be returning home # # When the hills conceal the setting sun # # Stars begin appearing one by one # # Night travels all # # And though fortune may forsake me # # Sweet dreams will ever take me home # Any more for Hans Crescent, Hammersmith or Hyde Park? Last bus, gentlemen. Good heavens, my last train, It was clever of you to get a taxi. Oh well that was simple. I just made a noise like American. Any other time, that'd be very funny. Don't worry, Pat, you're gonna make it all right, Well it will strain Anglo-American relations to breaking point if I don't, Well that certainly mustn't happen agaln. Where are we? End of Whitehall. Oh, can you see the time by Big Ben? Yeah, it's 10 after 10. Three minutes, I'll just about do it if I'm lucky, What is it, green? Yeah, yeah. Just made it. Got your ticket ready? Yes. I'd better say goodbye now. Not on your life, Pat. I'm gonna put you right on that tram. Well I'll have to run for it I'll be all ready to jump out. Right. Okay. Here you are, buddy. - We made it. - Right. I had a wonderful time. - Good. - Goodbye, He's ever such a nice boy. He said he was from Texas but he looks just like a guy I know in Lambeth. Was he a GI? No, top Sergeant. Go on, was he nice? Oh I suppose so. But don't they expect a lot of gratitude. Just 'cause they give us some Camels and a lipstick? I'll say. I said to him I said, "I bet you don't act "like this with American girls." Like the one I was with Saturday at the Regent Palace. You know, the one that looks like Jimmy Stewart. He gave me this bracelet from Algiers. Gold? Course. Oh. Oh well, night shift this week so I shall have to go all quiet. Here, have a smoke. No, tar. Go on, I've got lots of them. Oh, thanks. Would you like one? Oh, thank you. And look, nylons. All the way up too. Cool, aren't you lucky? Who gave them to you? This Top Sergeant I was tellin' you about. Gee, he must be a proper sport. He's a sport all right but I don't know about proper. Ah we all talk the same language all right but it's a different world, ain't it? I'll say. Hey Johnnie, where you been? Oh, roundabout, Ah you should have stuck with me. Boy did find a tomato. Yeah? Stick your head under the cover and imagine you've still got her. I tried that, it don't work. Oh, good morning, Mr. Jenkins. Morning, Mrs. Patterson. Got a special delivery letter here somewhere for you. Yep, here it is I believe it's from England, Stamps don't look like ours. Yes, thank you, it's from John. What's he say? I live in Grosvenor Square. That's "Grosvenor". They call it "Grovener". How can they make "Grosvener" "Grovener"? Well I guess it's Just a foreign way of pronouncing things, Just like they don't say "Warwick", they say "Warrick". Oh it worries me sometimes to think about John being over there with all those foreigners. Well, too bad for you old boy, this is payday, huh? Yeah, too bad. Cut 'em. You know what English call payday? Payday I suppose. No, no. The Ghost Walks. You know there's a ghost walking around 20 Grosvenor Square? Yeah? She mends socks ** At night when I go to bed I wash out my socks, hang them up full of holes. In the morning they're all fixed. Sews on buttons too, eh? Yeah and buttons. How did you know that? Well I got an idea I know that ghost. Well, this government may be all right for now but what about later on? Eh, you ain't voting for later on, No? When shall I be then? Later on. I may not be here then. When? ** Well what are you worrying about? Hello? Pat darling, where's that report on the Totnes speech? Over there on the table. But I thought that had all been organised, Miss Maxwell. Well you must arrange for the older children to be taken there separately. Well use your initiative, Miss Maxwell. David, the school children may not be there after all. Oh, just as well, They'll probably be so overcome by my oratory they'll be sick by the class-load. Oh don't be disgusting, David, Where did you say that report was? Ah. I wonder how old I was when I did that? One of the artist's earlier works, obviously. Now, here are your notes for Morton Tankerville. How's your voice, David? Terrible. Where are my lozenges? Here in your right hand pocket. Mildred, I'm going to tell them my story about the Scotch gamekeeper, Must you? It always goes well. It didn't go very well last Saturday, but still, You won't forget your bus, Lady Patricia? - Bus? - Good heavens, I must go, Where? To the station to meet John. John? John Patterson, you know. Grandfather asked him down. Well don't be long. Now Patricia, if there are any reporters at the station, be nice to them. All right. Hello. Hello there. | didn't expect you to meet me. It's a pleasant surprise. Well I'm the only one free, The others are up to their eyes in the election. Oh, you'll have to carry a bag, I'm afraid, Our only porter is acting as steward to grandfather, It's no problem, how do we go? Shank's pony, Any relation to Queenie? Same action, a bit slower, Oh I get it, we walk, Yes we walk. It's only about a mile. Shouldn't we have blown a trumpet or something so they could have lowered the drawbridge over the moat? Yes, except for the drawbridge isn't there and the moat's full of brussel sprouts. Say. That's beautiful. Oh it's a bit untidy now. You should have seen it before the war. This would look good in a movie. How old is it? Well it's mostly 13th century. The stables are the oldest part. And the horses? Oh they're quite new. Telegram, sir. Thanks. I'm rather worried about His Grace, sir. Really Parker, why? This election, he gets so excited. Oh, he's a tower of strength. We couldn't do without him. Yes, but he's not a young man, sir. Hello, I got him. How are you, John? Fine sir. Hello Patterson, nice to see you. Thank you Major. We just go to Morton Tankerville for a meeting. We're heading slowly but unsurely for the last round up. And when do they vote? Tomorrow, bless their little hearts. Never go into politics, Patterson. What, no future in it? No, I'd settle for a nice quiet raid on the French coast any day. I'll see you at the meeting, Pat. Good luck. We'll have some tea and I'll show you around, We might ride over to Morton Tankerville. You can ride, I suppose? I suppose I can. How am I doing? Knees in, toes in, heels up. Out my way we figure as long as you don't fall off you're doing all right. I can see you've never ridden before. Come on, we'll go up on the moor and get a good gallop there. Swell. Well I Just beat you. Only by about 20 lengths, All right, I'll take that two shillings and Sixpence. I bet you earn your living in rodeos. As a matter of fact I've never even seen a rodeo. What do you do in Civvy Street, John? Now do you really want to know or are you just asking? I really want to know. Well. In real life I'm a construction engineer. I got my first big break on the Boulder dam. I suppose you've heard of it. Yes, of course We heard of it. Without bothering you with the dimensions, you know when we built it we opened up more land than, well than there is on this whole island. And I suppose we harness more power there than Mr. Hitler has got in all of his tanks, aeroplanes and armies put together. And I bum part of in. Not much, I'll admit, but I think I could take you out and show you which part it was I did build. And you want to get back. I certainly do. I suppose that an sounds kind of remote to you. I suppose it should, but in a funny sort of way it doesn't, That's the son of think I'd like to do too. Would you? Yes, I would. It's a beautiful View here, isn't it? Beautiful. When the visibility is good you can see as fares Plymouth Hoe. You know, back in Arizona, when the visibility is good you can see, you can almost see Devonshire. Well you can't see Arizona from here. Pat. Yes? You know something? No, what? Right at this moment I don't particularly wanna see Arizona. Don't you? Not right at this moment. I should like to see Arizona sometime. Would you really? Yes, I should. John, we've got to shock the natives tonight with some jitterbug. What, is there a dance? Yes, after dinner. The tenants and the election helpers come in from miles around. It sounds like fun I wish I had something to put on besides this uniform. Oh don't worry about that, I'll be in uniform too. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. Why? Well you know back home when we have a dance or a party we sort of like for our girls to dress up, As a matter of fact we feel kind of cheated if they don't. American girls are very smart, aren't they? Oh sure, certainly. You know Dallas Texas has some of the smartest dressed women in the world. Dallas? I'll remember that. Why I thought they only did that in the movies. Oh no, there's mm a few of us left. Of course I don't very often do this for the ladies. A couple of different methods of doing this, you know. There's the Arizona method and there's the Texas method. This happens to be the Arizona method. What's the Texas method? Well, Texans use a little more spill. Here. Lick. Good. Could you do that with one hand? Supposing I could, what would I do with the other one? You would need that to put out the fire you start in the hayrick. Yes I guess I am a We crazy. Yes I guess you are. Morton Tankerville's down there. Is it? We better go. Pat. What you must all remember is that this government is only you under another name. That's what democracy means. Does democracy mean one man owns the whole of this village? The owner of this village, Sir, gained his land and position through his ancestor's service to the State. Democracy demands such service. Say what you like. We all have to pay our rent to one man. How long have you lived in this village, sir? He don't live here. He's down in his summer holidays! Now people in this part of the world like to do their thinking for themselves. And the job of an MP is to find out what they are thinking and tell the world by standing up on his hind legs at Westminster. Now until the war is over, I shan't be able to get upon my hind legs for you. I shall probably be lying on my stomach most of the time. But I think that what I shall learn and what I have learnt from your husbands and sons and boyfriends will make me more fit to be your MP in the long run. You've held a seat for 300 years, you should think that's long enough run. I see I can't count on your vote, sir. Me, I'm not voting for anyone. Did you hear that? There's a man here who said he's not gonna vote for anyone! In this country, you're free to vote for the man you want, Tomorrow's polling day. And if you don't want to vote for me then vote for the other fellow. But for god's sake vote for someone! Ah but you started them off, sir. My Scotch gamekeeper, that always goes well. Hello, John. Oh, John, I want you to meet Captain Trethewey, our political agent, John Patterson. How do you do? Well Major. What a barrage. How do you think it went, Pat? I'm afraid I missed it, David. We've only Just arrived. Oh. Yeah but we heard them rooting for you, Oh, there's quite a bit of opposition today. Well come on sir, we must get going. I've got to kiss 30 more babies before dinner. I'll wager he'll get a majority of over 15 hundred. Well gentlemen, this is the eve of battle, so to speak. Aye, there'll be fine goings-on up at the castle. Yeah, austerity goings on this election. Not like the old times. I mind the time when His Grace had as many as 200 guests and 10 suckling pigs, half a dozen boar's heads and two haunches of venison. Aye, them were the days. Half past seven. They'll just about be sitting down to it now. Parker. Where's Lady Patricia? Lady Patricia is here, your Grace. About time. Good heavens. Sorry I'm late, darling, Patricia. You look positively pre-war. Oh thank you Mildred, I feel it. Just like me a few years ago. Don't you think so, David? Yes, rather. Just watch out, Dallas. Well I didn't want you to feel cheated, I certainly don't. ** Thank you. I like that hairdo too. You looked so splendid at your last meeting. Oh thanks. Just like one of the knights of the round tame. Really? I thought of Tennyson, "Your strength is as the strength of 10 "because your heart is pure." Is what? Pure. Here, have some mustard. I don't mind if I do. Parker, what's this I'm eating? You grace is eating, Really? Yeah but beautifully cooked. A white sauce disguises anything. Mildred, you will never guess what we're eating. No, no, no, don't tell me. I suppose in Arizona when you are hungry you just go out and kill a buffalo. Sure. Well unless you want to eat them alive, you do. Is that the Arizona method? No, that was the Texas method. And he says if you don't wanna vote for me then vote for the other fellow. But vote for somebody, Oh, that's just like Master David, But I don't like the other fellow. How's that? He's a foreigner, Foreigner? Comes from Somerset. Well Somerset's the next county, You can't call him a foreigner anyhow. I've been here for nigh on 50 years and they still call me one. Nine o'clock, they'll just about he going into the drawing room now. Yeah, and His Grace will be taking Master David in to meet 'em. Everything present and correct, Trethewy? Present and correct. My friends, following the ancient tradition of this constituency, I have pleasure on the eve of the poll in welcoming on your behalf Major David Bruce, the duly assigned and trusted nominee of our party, and in wishing him godspeed to Westminster, It's been a pleasure. You'll romp home. You've been a great help, thank you. That's all right. Thank you so much. An Md American custom, excuse me. Oh. John, you and twill dance this together. Oh, why with pleasure, ma'am. Now there's one thing I want you clearly to understand. Yes? Whatever Jitterbug ts, I don't. I don't either. I think we could learn though. Enjoying yourself? Having a wonderful time, Yes, I thought you were. Aren't you? Having the time of my life, ** Oh David, you've nothing to worry about. Oh, the other fellow's pretty go ahead. Do you think so? And he said he gets most of the votes the other side of the river. Oh you'll get most of them this side. ** It's been ages since we danced together. Well there's not much time, is there? No, I suppose not. I'm glad you dressed up tonight. Yes, it's a nice feeling, Is that why you did it? Well he started it, didn't he? Yes, I suppose he did. You know, Mrs. Catchpole has got a little hidden streak of boogie-woogie in her, She ought to work on it, You should tell her. I'm having fun, You having fun? Yes of course. What's wrong? Just thinking. About this afternoon? Maybe. Let's go out on the porch where it's a little cooler, shall we? We don't call it a porch. ** Terrace. Well, let's go out on the terrace ** Cigarette? No, thanks. Oh I haven't stopped rolling them. I carry these for special occasions, Is that the Dart river? Yes, that's the river Dart. You know back home sometimes when we have parties we take the horses out. If it's clear enough you can do that there, Is it? Yes it is. Look Pat, I'm afraid maybe I was a little fresh this afternoon. You see I didn't stop to think where I was or the kind of girl I was with. I'm sorry. You needn't be. I guess I sort of did skip formalities, huh? I didn't miss them. Did you really put that dress on for me? Yes. Pat, did you mean it? Mean what? This afternoon on the moor. Do you really want to know or are you just asking? I really want to know. Yes. Did you? Yes. Sure it wasn't just an Arizona method? Arizona, China, Devonshire, I don't know Pat. I do know that I love you. I love you, John. Where do we go from here? I mustjust see he's all right at the election. David? Yes. Does he come into this? Yes. How much? A lot. I reckon Master David will romp home with a majority of over 12 hundred, ma'am. 200 will do, Mr. Pearce. Ah, not enough for me. I like, oh look at him there pacing up and down nervous as a kitten. And there he was at Dunkirk, waist deep in water for six hours with nothing on but... Quite, quite, we know all the details, Mr. Pierce. I've arranged for the newspaper men to come around and see you as soon as the mum is declared or would you like me to talk to them? No, no I will. - Well I will if you like. - No, it's fine. Hello, Merridew, how are you standing the strain? Well it's certainly going to be a close thing. Yes, quite a party. Heard it wasn't a bad speech of yours last night, Major. Did my best. Well I hope your best wasn't good enough. We'll soon know. Well, I'll be seeing you, Major. Yeah good luck. Good luck? How are you feeling, David? I'm cracking. | just wished my opponent good luck. Oh, well he'll need it. You've certainly drawn the crowds. We had quite a time getting through. We? John and I. Oh yes, of course, Well the Grammar School boys are all rooting for you like mad. Rooting? Oh yes of course, we don't cheer now. Do we? You root. Are you rooting for me, Pat? Of course, David. What a mob. You know, you British aren't supposed to be that emotional. No, we have our moments. David, I'll take John up on the church steps. We'll be able to see everything from there. - Good luck. - Thanks. Good luck, Major. Could we get through please? Pardon us. AM this excitement for one member of Parliament huh? Good thing you don't elect your kings over here. Thank you. These officers want to see the Mayor, Sergeant. I'm sorry sir, there's no admission to the Council Chamber {HI after the count. That's all right, Sergeant. We're from the War Office. We must see the Mayor immediately. Will you come this way sir and I'll find out if the Mayor will see you. A few riots and fights. Well somebody may break a window but he'll be full of apologies in the morning, I don't see many cops. Oh they're both around somewhere, I don't know how I'm going to do it. Of course you can appeal against it, sir. Yes, yes. Your (Erase the count is complete. Oh yes, I'll come. You must excuse me gentlemen, I think you'll find that it will be all right. Of course, complete arrangements will be made. American Army lorries will remove all valuables before they take over, Exmoor Castle without the Exmoors. Do you think he'll be all shot up when he knows? I'm afraid so. I suppose I should have told him last night but I just hadn't the heart with the election hanging over him. There's no doubt about his being elected, is it? Oh, none, This has been a stronghold for the past 300 years. Here they come. Ladies and gentlemen. I have to declare the result of the poll. The Parliamentary bye-election for the constituency of Exmoor, Charles Merridew, Independent, 7,540. David Bruce, National Government, 7,048. Majority for Merridew, 492, Poor David. My friends, I thank you, You showed what you wanted and you got it! I'm not going to say that you're not right, I'm very proud to have beaten so grand an opponent. Well, I said at my last meeting to vote for someone. You certainly have. I don't agree with his politics but it's been a good clean fight. Now I shall go back to my job and leave him to his. And when the wars over, who knows, maybe I might try again. Well, does anyone want anything else? No. Patricia? No, thank you. David? I can't help feeling that we should have had more women canvassers. - I'm sure that... - Mildred, please. No post mortems. Well. Is there a railway timetable anywhere? Parker has one. Will it be up to date? It was a few months ago. Are you catching the midnight? Well I pack at crack of dawn. I've got to get back tomorrow. I'll phone the station. Well, shall we be moving? I shell be in the drawing room if I'm wanted. Will you want any coffee? No. Well, where will you be if you're wanted? I'd like some air. I'll try to find you some, Hadn't you better say it? Say what? That you don't feel the same as you did, I'm sorry David. I'm out of my depth. I'm not exactly paddling myself. It's Patterson, isn't it? Yes. Well, go on. It just happened. It's the last thing I ever dreamt could happen. Go on. I can't go on. There's nothing more to say. There seems to be quite a bit more to say. You're not a hysterical girl in a magazine story. Why, you've only just met him. That doesn't seem to make any difference. Snap judgement? Yes, I suppose so. Well, what happens now? I don't know. Do you mean to say this fellow can come on weekend leave and break up everything we meant between us? I don't believe it! I said I'm sorry, David. So you did, and you can say it again, It's very easy. Oh, don't talk like that. How do you want me to talk? Through the conventional stiff upper lip? Jolly good luck, may the best man win and I'll send you a cake stand for your new home? David, I can't bear it. I happen to have loved you for a longtime, Pat. You've been a large part of my life and I've trusted you an along the line. But David, it's always been you always until now. I know I'm hurting you but you Just got to understand, I never thought this could happen to us. There doesn't seem to be very much us about it anymore. David, can't you see how I'm hating myself for letting you down? I'm desperately unhappy and, I'm sorry, what else is there I can say? Don't say anything else. I won't either. I seem to have been making speeches for weeks and a lot of good it's done anyone, Oh Parker I, Oh hello David. I came to tell you I'm catching the midnight, sir, I thought you were going in the morning. No, the Sunday trains are pretty bad and I've got to report back tomorrow. Oh that's too bad. I'm sorry I let you down, sir. You didn't. 300 years is a pretty long innings. I hoped I wouldn't be the one to close it. Don't be a fool, David. You did splendidly. These things happen. Besides we need a jolt every 300 years or so. Stops us getting in a rut. Thanks, sir. Don't you take it to heart. Oh look, I came across something here which will amuse you. Here, that will make you laugh. Yes, very funny. Cheerio, sir. What's the matter with you? Dame trouble keeping you awake or something? I guess it's mostly another guy. What's that? I'm thinking of another fellow. Bed is no place to be thinking about men, Do that on Uncle Sam's time, tomorrow! How long we've been together now, Butch? What am I, a quiz kid or something? About two years now is it? Yeah ever since Harlingen Field, Texas. Well we're splitting up. Huh? I'm going beckon operations. You're wacky. The quack will never pass you. I saw him today, he'll be okay. You can't do that to me Johnny, and leave me flapping around on the ground, Maybe that's the one bright spot in the whole mix-up. Soldiers have arrived with a lorry, Your Grace. Shall I tell them to start loading? Yes, better give them a cup of tea, They are American soldiers, your grace. In that case, Parker, give them a cup of coffee and apologise in advance. Yes, sir. Parker, you've got all your things together? Yes, Your Grace, When was the last time you packed? Boer War, Your Grace. Richard? How is Suki going to travel? In a basket, I imagine. Oh I don't think I like that. I don't think Suki will like it either. You'll have to explain to her that this is total war, even for cats. I'm rather worried about Parker. All this seems to have upset him. After all, he's not a young man. # Happy birthday to you # # Happy birthday dear lady # # Happy birthday Mrs. Wilson # Well boys. It's all right, Mom. 72 years I never wanted to make a speech. Now I want to, I can't get it out. Oh we know what you're thinking. Are you having fun? Sure, swell. There's one thing I wish though. What's that? I wish Lady Patricia were here. She's been here, Mom. Didn't she love it? Well she almost missed her last train. Morning sir, they are waiting for you in the mess. Thank you, corporal. May I take that for you? Thanks. How are you, Pat? I'm all right, David, you? All right. Haven't seen you for some time, No, I thought of writing to you but I didn't know what to say. How's Patterson? I don't know. Haven't you seen him? No. Oh. I was wrong, David. It was one of those things. Was it? Yes, it's all over. And forgotten? I can't forget what I did to you that night, David, I served you some pretty unfair ones in the heat of the moment. The Mess is there. Yes, I remember. David? Yeah? I'm going to be in London sometime soon. They want to interview me for a commission. Oh that's fine. I don't suppose you get up there much nowadays? Well I'm about due for 48. If you're coming up to town Just hose off a carrier pigeon, All right. So long. Corporal. So long, sir, I'll raise you thruppence. It's in the bag, Butch. What's in what bag? I'm okay, back on operations. No kiddin' Johnny? No kiddin'. Orders just came through, Good morning, Your Grace, Good morning, Bates. Your Malvern water, Your Grace? No, Bates. Bollinger '28, a hat home, And two glasses? One glass, Two glasses, Bates. Two masses, Bates. Why aren't you earning your pay and allowances instead of hanging around here? On 24 hour leave sir. Urgent personal affairs. Patricia's got her commission. That's the most urgent and personal of them, sir. How did you know? I got my own carrier pigeon. I suppose that's what you call military intelligence? No, inter-service liaison. Why aren't you liaising her over to dinner? ** She didn't tell me. ** Do you understand what you're talking about, David? Only when I listen very attentively, Is that your own? No. Really, you young people seem to think you own the papers in this dub. Who is that ridiculous old gentleman trying to look like Lord Palmerston? Oh really? I shall have to sue. Ah, that's right. To Patricia. An officer and a gentleman. Hi Mom. Hi, John. You're Just in time for a nice cup of tea. Fine, good. I know it's not very big, but it's alive I think. - For me? - Sure. It's lovely. I know you like your tea strong, don't you? I certainly do. Sit down. Say mom? Yes John? I'm leaving. Oh? Where? I'm going back on combat duty. When? Tomorrow. Short notice. Thanks. Got your socks and undervest, everything's ready. That's fine and dandy. I'll take care of those. Nonsense. I shall pack for you. What about your soap and such like? What about your tea? It's getting cow. How are you off for money? Why, haven't you heard? We Americans have got it all. Don't you listen to a lot of busybodies, Nothing to do but gossip. I've got a little money put away in War Loans. Have you? That's good. Yes I haven't anyone. I'd like you to have it. Well now listen, Mom. I've got a few dollars. As a matter of fact I've got a few put aside to bring you back a little souvenir. John! Now. I'll be back one of these days. Well now what can we drink to next? Oh, the relief of Mafakin. By jove, yes, and Spion Kop. Oh we must be going. Pat and I have got some hard celebrating to get through tonight. I wish I wasn't dining with Mildred. I'd have loved to have come with you. Yes, it's too bad, sir. Perhaps I could put her off. Oh you couldn't do that, darling. It would be unkind. Yes, it would, wouldn't it? I wonder if I could get them to make me a midshipman or something just to be in fashion? You certainly splice the main brace very professionally. I learned that young, my boy. I had a nurse who came from Plymouth. Oh, darling, goodnight, If you run away to sea before we get back, leave a telephone number with Wilson. Perhaps I could persuade Wilson into a life on the ocean wave. Yes, do. Then we could have a combined operation in the family. I think I must leave the combining to you two, Good luck to it. Say, have you been using my shaving soap again? A guy's got to shave, ain't he? Well you'll be using your own from now on. How many esses in miserable? Miserable is, who are you writing to? Mom. What you belly-aching her about? Well I'm gonna miss you, Johnny. So what? I'm going to miss you too. Never been on a mission without you. Knock it out of there. All right. And don't forget to give her my love. Can you imagine that phoney quack turning me down, and me as fit as Yeah, yes ##. You can see that. I'm going down to say goodbye to Pop. Johnny Patterson sends you his love. Good have a nice time. Enjoy yourselves. Goodnight, darling, don't wait up for us. Good evening, Parker. Good evening, sir, John, come in, my dear fellow, Hello, sir. Where have you been hiding? We haven't seen you lately. No sir, I've been pretty busy. Come and sit down. Well thanks but I just came in to say goodbye to you. Goodbye? Yes, I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you off to? Going back to combat duty. I just got my orders today. You know, John, we only just got to know you. Well, I suppose that's the way it goes, sir. Now I can't begin to tell you what it's meant to me knowing you, all of you. You know John, having you down there for our lime flare up, made me feel, made us all feel that you were a sort of ambassador. Makes me proud to have you say that sir. I guess no guy in striped pants and a shiny hat ever had a grander welcome than what I had. Well you were the right man for the job, Striped pants or no striped pants. John, I've got something here I want you to have. I aways meant to give it to someone but somehow I never met anyone I wanted to give it to. It belonged to my son. He was in the Air Force in the last war. Thanks, Pop. I've got a lot of packing to do. I think I better get busy with it. I'll come with you. Hello everybody, it's nice to see you again. it's lovely being out with you again, David. I haven't taken anybody out for centuries. I think my technique will be a bit rusty. I keep expecting someone to nudge me and say "Shove the salt along, chum." I know the feeling. Shove the salt along, chum. David. Thanks. David? Yes? Why did you ask me out tonight? Oh, to celebrate? I was afraid you might not, Why? Bygones. I hate bygones. They don't get you anywhere. You are sweet, David. Ah, there you are, splendid. Look who I've brought you. John! Hello, Pat. He's got to go back to duty tomorrow. I knew you'd want him to spend his last evening with you. Well I must get along. Got Mildred outside in a taxi. Lifeboat night, you know. Goodbye, Patricia. Have a nice time, enjoy yourselves. Good night Jules. Sit down. Waiter? You know I didn't have the slightest idea where we were coming. He just said he had a little surprise for me. Have you eaten? Yes, I have, thanks. Like a drink? Yes, I certainly would. Could I have a Scotch and soda, please? Yes, rather. Waiter? Yes, sir? - Whiskey and soda, please? - Yes sir. Look I hope I'm not busting in to something here. No, we were just celebrating. Pat's got her commission. We were having a drink on it amongst other things. Congratulations, Thank you. You're off tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow. My orders just came through this afternoon. I see. Look, don't mind me if you want to dance or something, go ahead, please. No, it's all right. Yes, come on David, let's dance. Patterson's gone. Yes, I know. Let's sit down. Excuse me, Madam. The American gentleman who was with you asked me to tell you he had to keep an important appointment. He said he was sorry and knew you'd understand, Thank you. Well would you like to go home or should we go on somewhere? Let's go on somewhere, David. It's getting rather dismal for a celebration isn't it? I'll do some telephoning, book a table. Don't be long. Don't wait up for me. Regent 8484. Regent 8484. It's nice to see you again Major Bruce. Thanks. Are you in London now? Just a few hours, yes, Regent 8484. It's your call, sir. Hello? Is Sergeant Patterson there? He has? Will you tell him he's wanted on the telephone please? Hold on phase. Patterson! Yeah? Waiter? Yes sir? Will you tell Lady Patricia she's wanted... - on the telephone? - I will, sir. It's in the box. Madam. Thank you. Hello? Hello, this is Sergeant Patterson, Pat? John? I'm sorry I walked out, Pat, but when I saw you with David again, well I JUST couldn't take it. I had to get out. No, John, don't hang up, something's happened. Well, I can't explain here. Yes, come around as quickly as you can, I'll wait for you outside the Grill. All right. Shall we take a taxi? Not a chance during the alert, sir. Let's walk. Sure. What happened, Pat? Where's David? He's gone. He's gone, why? Well he knew. I hoped he didn't but he knew. He knew what? That I wasn't in love with him. Oh. He put that call through to you. And then he went away? Yes, and went away. John, why didn't you write or anything? I couldn't do it, Pat. I just couldn't break the two of you up like that. I hoped maybe you'd forget, ** And did you? No I didn't. I never would have believed that forgetting could be so hard. I tried too. I thought I'd get full marks but I didn't even pass. I love you more than ever, Pat. I love you, John. I didn't think I'd ever say that again. I can't believe it's happened. David made it happen. If he'd asked me to marry him tonight I'd have said yes. But he's let me say "I love you" to you. Why did he let me say it? I guess he's just that sort of a guy. I didn't know there was that sort of a guy. No, they don't come that way very often. Oh, where do we go from here? Any place you say. Can't you look where you're going? I'm sorry, I beg your pardon. Where's your torch? Haven't you got a torch? ** Have you? No. Well I got a lighter here. That's better than nothing. Might be all right if it had any petrol in it, Well they'll just have to bump off us. Know what I'm thinking? No, what? Well I was Just thinking if we kept walking in this direction far enough, we might just hit Arizona. Course it'll be a little tough in this blackout. I thought the nights were so bright out there that you could ride between dances. That's right, they are. We will get there sooner or later, won't we, John? When there isn't a blackout anymore? Will you come with me, Pat? Of course I'll come with you. Hey, do you want a taxi? What, are you kidding? What, don't you want a ride? Look, mister, when we want a ride we'll just saddle the horses, won't we? Copilot. Copilot. Hey Curt. Engineer? Engineer?

Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends. Thus, in the midst of those who do so deeply sense the infinite beauty of the sacrifice and in the company of their own comrades-in-arms, we should hear their benediction from almighty God upon the very threshold of their passing, A flag was found amidst the wreckage of the flying fortress. And it is the wish of their commanding officer that our Mayor should present it to the village school of this community, Philip Simons. Philip Simons. Your ancestor Jesiah Simons of this parish sailed from the port of Plymouth over 300 years ago to the country from whence this flag has come to us. And it may well be that some blood of the gallant company that sailed with him had floated into the veins of those who gave their lives for us in this village of Exmoor. Take this flag to your companions and treasure it always. Now come and bear witness that these brave men laid down their lives for this corner of England. Captain Gerard Schuyler, Vermont, Maine.
