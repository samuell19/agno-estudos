My name is Uki and this is a story of how successful I am at work. -Good morning, Uki. -Good morning. Good morning, Mr Uki! -Good morning! -You look fresh today. -Good morning, Uki. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning, Mr Uki. Uki? -Why are you still sitting there? -This is where I sit, Sir. Uki, I have given you a promotion. Look, I have prepared an office for you. I have given you an office just for yourself over there. Why are you still sitting here? Are you serious, Sir? -He is joking. -This guy likes to joke. He is always joking. You are my favorite employee. I trust you completely. That is why I am giving you an office. So I am going to congratulate you one more time. Thank you, Sir. -I will see you in my office, okay? -All right, Sir. Uki, congratulation. To your office. -Uki, congratulation. -Thanks. Too bad it was all just a dream, a fantasy. But that is okay. I still have my encouragement. Work hard and keep learning. All right, Mr Aryo Keukeuh. As a successful person who started your career as an ordinary employee... ...until you become the chairman of a marvelous company. Maybe you could share a few tips with our viewers today. -A bit here. -Right. The first tip is, pick a company where you can learn your ropes. And your goal is the learning experience, not the money. -A little higher. -Right. Be diligent, observant, learn, and be committed. A bit lower. That is right. The point is... Be diligent, observant, learn... ...and be committed. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. I get frustrated everyday when I am going to work. Afraid you will arrive here before I do. Do you get a large bonus... ...if you are the first person to arrive at the office? There is an oil stain on your shirt. -Over there. -Damn! Don't worry. Just pour salt on top of it. Leave it for a while and then brush it. The stain will go away. As you can see here, I am always the first person to arrive at the office. -Good morning. -Good morning, Sir. Just take a look right here. I think there's a miscalculation. The file is right over there. Take a look. Putra, finish the report. -Then put it on my desk, okay? -All right, Ma'am. -Good morning! -Morning. "Kopi Mana Kopi" is a new line of coffee that's suitable for our new generation. "Kopi Mana Kopi" is a new line of coffee. It's quoteable and memeable. "Kopi Mana Kopi" is a new line of coffee that's suitable for our new generation. Why are you so diligent? It's still too early. Being diligent makes us smart, not rich or get promoted. That's the mystery in life. I have become an exemplary employee. But throughout my five years of working here, I have never been promoted at all. "Kopi Mana Kopi"... So are you guys ready? Show me your brilliant ideas for our commercial of "Kopi Mana Kopi". Where's the coffee? Who will go first? Can I go first, Sir? Sure. "Kopi Mana Kopi" is a new line of coffee that's suitable for our new generation. Not old people like us. So I think we need to approach it based on the style of our new generation. It begins in a cafe, where there are two tables facing opposite one another. There is a teenage boy and girl sitting there, who doesn't know each other. But they're both gloomy and sad. And then, comes a waiter putting a cup of hot black coffee in front of the girl. And then she said, "Sorry, I didn't order coffee." "Coffee is bitter. I don't like it." And then, the boy approached the girl and said, "But life is just like a coffee." "Where bitter and sweet of life gets together." -Good job! -Thank you, Sir. -I love it! -Yes! Excuse me, Sir. That presentation which was presented by Handi is exactly the same as mine. -What do you mean? -He stole my idea. -There's a girl here being approached... -That's enough, Uki. -Look. -Enough! Let's continue this meeting first. We'll talk about it later. I told you, that's impossible! Sir, I've always tried to be a good employee for your company. I have a very high integrity for this company. I've never been late to the office. I am even the first person to arrive every morning to the office. Bootlicker. I don't want to have a bootlicker employee in my company. You think I'm a bootlicker? A bootlicker is someone who elevates themselves by overthrowing other people. Come in. Excuse me, Sir. I bought you your favorite coffee. Nice! -Very delicious! -Really? Here it is, an example of an exemplary employee. -He cares for his boss. -You're too kind. -I need to get back to work. -All right. -Thank you. -Thanks for the coffee. Uki. Let me tell you what. If you say that you are the best employee, an employee who has intensity. A high integrity for my company, I'm giving you another chance. You have to make your own version of the "Kopi Mana Kopi" commercial. Tomorrow, you can present it to me. -Be a boss! -Be a boss! -Filthy rich! -Filthy rich! -Live happily ever after! -Live happily ever after! You all are quite marvelous! Now it's time for me to ask our marvelous viewer at home. Does the company you work for makes you passionate about your work? I will ask you one more time. Does the company you work for makes you passionate about your work? Come on, don't just shake your head. Answer me seriously. No. -Do you feel depressed? -Yes. Does your boss gets angry with you often everyday? -Come on, answer me seriously. -Yes. Do you feel happy when your boss is angry with you? -No. -Right. Right, what? Do you want to change your future? Hey, do you want to or not? Come on! Do you want to or not? -Do you want to or not? -Yes, I do! Now that's the spirit of our marvelous viewer at home. There's only one way to do that. Do not become a subordinate. You have to become a boss for your own self. You have to quit your job and become an entrepreneur. -Be a boss! -Be a boss! -Filthy rich! -Filthy rich! -Live happily ever after! -Live happily ever after! Marvelous! Be a boss. Filthy rich, live happily ever after. Be a boss! Filthy rich, live happily ever after. Boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after! Boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after! Be a boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after! Be a boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after! Be a boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after. Be a boss, filthy rich, live happily ever after. Excuse me, Sir. Yes, Uki? -Have you prepared your presentation? -Yes, I have. Good. But, I apologize, Sir. I resign. I've had enough, Sir. Did he just say a title to a song? Following what Aryo Keukeuh suggested... ...finally without long preparations, I quit my job. See you. Uki, let me know, okay? If you've become successful! That's "if"! From now on you don't have to be frustrated... ...going to the office very early. I had quit my job. See you. Yes! Here's your drink. Thank you. Are you sure you're going to open a laundry business? Yes, Mom. Aryo Keukeuh said, we must have our own business that we're passionate about. Well, I will always support anything you do. But you have to plan it very thoroughly, okay? It's not easy to open up a business and become successful just like that. Well, when I was a kid, my family was very poor. Mommy! Hi, Honey! You're home already? When my father passed away, she became the breadwinner. She worked as a laundress. Here, Honey. Let me help you? We were so poor, I only have one set of school uniform that I have to wear everyday. It's done. You rinse it. And my mother always washed my uniform clean everyday. -Mommy! -Hi, Honey! Like any kid at primary school who likes to play, I often got home from school... ...with stains on my uniform such as ink, mud, food, paint, etc. And my mother always have many tricks to remove those stains. Come on, Honey. Let me show you something. As far as I can remember, there aren't any stain that she couldn't remove. We put some lime on it. That's why I used to call her, The Stain Exterminator! Since then, I know a lot of tricks to remove many kind of stain. And washing was a sacred thing for the both of us. After some enlightenment from Aryo Keukeuh, plus the support of my mother, I began to pursue my business. -It's all good? -All good. I like this car. Thank you, Sir. For my venture capitol, I've risked all of my life savings... ...and sold my beloved car. And replaced it with an old scooter. Put this one right at the corner over there, okay? After years of being an employee and being oppressed by my boss, Now it's time for me to be the boss. The next step that I have to do is recruiting employees. What does it mean to be a boss, if you don't have any employees, right? Right! -Hello? -Hello, is this Mr Soni? Yes, that's right. Who is this? -I am the owner of Halilintar Laundry. -Ma'am, make it spicy. You sent a job application here, right? That's right. Right! Can you come here for an interview tomorrow? I don't know, Sir. -What's the matter? -I don't think you'll accept me. Can a person with a speech impediment work in a laundry business? Look, I can't even say "laundry"! Speech impediment has nothing to do with the performance of your work. But the others won't have speech impediment. They're going to tease me! All right then, let me think about it. Does anybody want a job? You know how to operate a washing machine, right? I'm expert on that! My mom was craving foams when she was pregnant. Can you pick clothes that needs to be washed in the washing machine? -Clothes? -Yes. Isn't this a car washing service? Where they lift the cars and wash it with steam or snow? Hey, Sir? Oh, my God! If you want to deal with clothes, you should open up a laundry business! Do you know that to be a front liner you must be friendly, not grumpy? I know. Sorry, but is that what you consider a friendly face? My face is already like this since I was born. Congratulation, Joni! You are hired to work here! Hold on, Sir. Don't accept me right away. Before that, I want to ask you something. Is there a TV for employees only? For what? Listen, I am currently watching a soap opera called... ..."Cheaters Caught Red Handed Because Someone Reported Them. Who did It?" Since the first episode until the 1,987th, I want to know who reported them. Frankly, I am willing to work... ...if there is a TV for employees only at that company. That's what I mean. There is one, isn't there? Of course, right? Hold on, Joni. Hello, Halilintar Laundry? Hello, Sir. It's me Soni again. Yes? Listen, do you think you're going to open up a branch in Depok? Even if I open up a branch in another planet, it doesn't concern you, right? If you open a branch in Depok it will be near to my house. But if you open it in another planet, let me think about it first. Damn you! Where were we, Joni? "Cheaters Caught Red Handed Because Someone Reported Them. Who did It?" No, it's okay. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'll just take... -I'll take this one, lemon. -Okay, thank you. You like lavender too, don't you? My favorite. -Is this all, Ma'am? -Yes, there are a few more. -Ma'am. -Yes? There is a lipstick stain on your shirt. I was in a hurry when I put it on, that's why it caught my lipstick. I know how to remove it. -Really? -Yes. Take a piece of cotton, dip it in an alcohol... ...and brush it on the lipstick stain. And then, when it's removed, just soak it with hot water. -Okay, thank you. -You're welcome. Hold on a second. All right, it's 330,000 IDR. Do you have a member card? -No, I don't. How much? -That's okay. -I'm sorry for that, Ma'am. -No, it's okay. Don't apologize. I should thank you for giving me those tips. I'm going to try it at home. Thank you so much. -Thanks. -Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Sir? Why are you still staring at her? She's already gone, you know? You should stare at me instead. It appears that opening up a business isn't as hard as I thought. There hardest thing is, how to get a customer? Good thing as an ex-creative worker... ...I'm used to think of ideas on how to attract customer's attention. -Is this a new laundry service? -Yes, Ma'am. Is it true there's a 10 percent cash back? That's right, Ma'am. What's your name? -Maria. -Maria? Everyone, let us welcome our first customer, Mrs Maria! Good morning. -Good morning, Boss. -Morning. Slowly but sure, my business is finally in motion. -What's your name? -Anto. At first when a customer comes, we will gather all their clothes... ...write them down and then weigh them. Excuse me, Sir. I'm a little bit confused here. What kind of clothes is this? Is this your bandana? You naughty boy! Oh, my God! After being written down and weighed, then Tiur will count... ...how much the customer has to pay and when will it be available. This is going to be done in two days. Hey, can you write the bill faster? I need to hurry and go to my aerobics class. Can't you see what I'm doing? Hey! Hey, good morning, Ma'am. Welcome to Halilintar Laundry. With our most humble humility... ...we thank you for trusting us with your clothes on our laundry. We will give you our best service. All right? After that, it's the washing stage. But before that, we need to short them out first... ...according to what kind of clothes and the colors. After shorting them out, we will put them in the washing machine. These washing machines, even though it's not brand new... ...but it's pretty good with the ability to dry the clothes automatically. One of the advantages of Halilintar Laundry, we are very generous of the use of detergent. So we guarantee it will smell very nice. Joni! Joni, can't you even do your job? There are three shorts, three trousers, and six underwear. But you didn't write down the underwear on the receipt. Oh, my God, Todung! Please think using your logic. Let me tell you something. When somebody is wearing shorts or trousers, there's definitely an underwear beneath it. So if it's says three trousers here... ...automatically there are three underwear, I don't need to explain it. Take a look. Here. Slowly. There. There's an underwear, right? Don't get too comfy! After that, the clothes will be ironed using a very hot steam iron. We guarantee, after this the clothes will be as good as new. Hey, what's the meaning of this? Why are you both half naked like this? Because the room is very hot. I'm telling you. That's right, Boss. Even my armpit hairs wants to come out because it's really hot. Oh, God! I don't want to know about your armpit hair! At the final stage, the clothes which are already clean... ...will be packed and ready to be returned to the customers. Boss, here are some food from Ambon. Thank you. Ma'am. I told you, don't pack shirts and pants together. You need to pack them separately. I have packed them separately. Look, these ones still got mixed up. Really? The way I see it, those are all shirts. This is obviously a pants. You're right, Boss. Yesterday, I thought I saw it was a shirt. Afterwards, that means the laundries are ready to be picked up by the customers. -Here. -Thank you, Ma'am. Ma'am, I want to pick up my laundries. Or we can send them to the customer. It depends on the demand. Joni, do you know where Toto is? Oh, my God! You never asks for him. Do you miss him or something? Miss him? God forbid that! He has a hair like a bowl of soup. What's wrong with Toto? Mrs Mia's laundries hasn't arrived yet. She was very upset to me. She said, she's going to sue this place. That's over exaggerating. Your bike broke down again, Toto? That's right, Boss. But don't worry. -I immediately order an online taxi. -To deliver Mrs Mia's laundries? No, to buy some gas. Toto, how many times... ...did your bike broke down, because you ran out of gas? Do you fill up the gas tank one liter at a time or what? -Yes, to save money. -What do you mean save money? Instead, you waste more money going around town looking for gas! Do you understand? Yes, Boss. Who the hell fills up their gas tank one liter at a time? How many liters should I fill up? Back when I was an employee, I often complain about my boss's behavior. Now that I'm a boss, I just realized that there are many dumb employees. Tiur! Tiur! Hello? Hey! Do you think you're a ghost that I can't see you? Why are you late again, Ujang? I'm sorry, Boss. The bus that I took crashed to an electricity pole. That's right! -Was the electricity pole okay? -Thank God it's fine, Boss. -Don't be late again! -I hope so, Boss. -Morning, this is Halilintar Laundry. -Why is it so hard to call you? I am Mrs Sinta. Can I speak to your boss? -This is me speaking. -I want to complain! Yesterday, I called your place and asked for a delivery, but was rejected! My laundries weighs 9 kg, you know? It's fine if you can't deliver it, but the way she said it is unacceptable! She said, "We can't deliver it." "Do you think this is your laundry service?" I am offended by that, you know? You have to teach some manners to your employees! Many people say that bosses usually acts foolish and irritating. I'm sure because they've never been a boss before. Because apparently, having a stupid subordinate... ...is even harder than having a stupid or a crazy boss. Tiur. -Why are you here? -I'm an employee here. Did you forget? No, this isn't lunch time yet. There's nobody at the front desk. Where's Joni? Do you think I'm his father? Tiur, Mrs Sinta just called and complained about you. Yeah... The witch? Don't ever pick a fight with a customer, Tiur. You can't keep on fighting our customers. If you keep doing that, they will run away. Do you understand? If they run away, I will become bankrupt. If that happens, how will I be able to pay you? With words and gratitude? That's nonsense, right? Haven't you heard that customers are kings? Come on, please stop doing that before I become bankrupt. All right, Boss. Next time I will treat our customer like a king. Boss, here are some food from Ambon. -Thank you, Ma'am. -Maybe you missed them. What the hell is this? Joni! -Joni? -Yes, Boss? Please come in. Hurry. What's wrong, Boss? Why does these bills look weird? Why does the price and the amount of weight does not match? Let me take a look. Boss, there's a discount in these bills. Just take a look. What? Why is that? Who gave them a discount? Tiur? Please explain to me why did you gave a discount to Mr Yayan. Do we have a discount program or something? -No, we don't. -Then why did you gave it to him? -He asked for a discount. -And you agreed to him? -You said costumers are kings. -So? If a king asks for a discount, shouldn't we give it to him? He's the king, right? Hi, Mr Yayan. Do you want another laundry service? My king. Tiur, give me another discount, okay? I'm sorry, Mr Yayan. We don't have a discount here. I will lose a lot of money if there is a discount everyday. Mr Yayan, let me whisper something to you. We can't hire an employee just based on their skills. But most important of all is their attitude. -Boss. -What? I want to go home early, Boss. What's wrong? The doctor said I have to rest for three days. Because I have symptoms of typhoid. Stadium two, Boss. Ouch! Stadium two? You don't believe me? Here, I brought the doctor's note. Why does it say, skin and genital specialist? Don't worry, Boss. I will change it to typhoid specialist. Don't worry, Boss. How can my socks get all mixed up? The colors are different. Is this your socks? And it smells too! Did you wash these socks? Can you guys even do your jobs? You have to be professional to work here. You need a diploma! I think you guys didn't even finished school. You have to listen when an elder is talking! Don't just stand there like an imbecile! How can this get mixed up in my laundries? Take a look. How come there's an underwear like this in my laundries? Take a look at this underwear. This doesn't belong to my wife! Just look at how small it is! My wife is going to divorce me because of this! Listen, the truth is I really wanted to divorce my husband... ...if it turns out that he was the one who wore that underwear. Besides, don't you guys have brains? How can I have something like this? You think I'm going to ride a motor taxi? What's the matter with you? How am I supposed go to a party tonight if my dress looks like this? Look! Do you think I'm a Sundal Bolong? I don't care how, but you have to pay for this dress! Do you know how much it costs? Five million rupiah! From now on, I will be more harsh to all of you. I will make a 10-point system. Each time someone makes a mistake, I will reduce their points. If you ran out of points, then I have to fire you. Oh, my God! If a customer's property gets damaged, I will not only reduce your points... ...but you must pay for it. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you be peace. Boss. I want to apologize. The vehicle I was on went through a bus way and was stopped by the cops. Ujang. Yesterday your bus crashed an electricity pole. The day before that, it went into a river. And the day before that, it got hit by a military truck. Is this actually your fault or the bus? I don't know anything about it, Boss. Maybe you can ask the driver. Congratulation, Ujang. You are the first employee whose points are being reduced. What points? I have always known that you are a hard worker. So don't make money or your position as the standard of your happiness. Because if you do that, you will never be happy. I'm sure you can get through all of this. You must be patient. Don't give up easily, okay? I always mention your name every time I pray. Thank you, Mom. Is that washing machine broken? Yes, it's been broken for a while. You wash with your hands again? Why didn't you tell me? -It's okay. I like doing it. -Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I don't pay much attention to you. You don't have to worry about me. I'll buy you a new washing machine. I won't allow you to wash with your hands again. Mom. I don't want you to be tired. Don't be like that. You don't need to worry about me. I love you so much, Mom. I will do anything to make you happy. I am very proud to have you. Hey, do you guys know that someone is opening another laundry business? -No, we don't, Boss. -Look! Oh, my God! It looks like they have advanced washing machines. -Mister. -Yes? -Is the owner here? -Yes, she's inside, Sir. Thank you. Hey, it's you. What are you doing here? -Do you work here? -Yes. This is my laundry business. By the way, we haven't introduce ourselves. I'm Agustina. -Uki. -Right. -See you. -What? See you? -Ma'am. -Hey, you. Actually, I just came here to ask you. What's your reason for opening a business here? I mean, across the street... ...there is a business that's exactly the same like this, right? Yes. -That's my business. -Oh, so that's yours? -That's right. -Nice. I mean, ethically speaking, this is not very ethical, right? What do you mean by that? I mean, this could be an unhealthy business competition, you know? I don't think so. Well, I think if you're confident on your product and services... ...you shouldn't be worried competing with me. Look, even mini markets opens so close to each other and they don't have a problem. At a traditional market, the vegetables merchant gathers with other vegetable merchants... ...and it's fine. Except, if you're not confident with you're own business. I'm so confident with my business. All right, then what are you afraid of? Let me tell you something. Instead of doing this, let's just compete in a healthy manner. All right. Cepat Kilat Laundry is giving a 10 percent discount... ...to members for a full month. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Hurry up and be a member. Because we have a 10 percent discount for a full month! Come on, join now, because we have a 10 percent discount for a month. Come, join with us now. There is a 10 percent discount for a month. Become a member now and get a 10 percent discount for a month. Goddamn it. Our customers are all going to that place. The handsome Mr Yayan is also going over there. My heart is broken. Oh, my God! Even the pretty ones goes there. Those Sales Promotion Girls are so hot and sexy. Hey, what are you guys doing here? She told us to be here, Boss. -That's right. -No, I didn't, Boss. Hurry, come forward. Boss, are you sure they won't be suspicious? If they caught me, they are going to kill me. It's going to be fine, Joni. This is for everybody's sake. Oh, my God! -All good! -Hold on a second. -Look, there he is. -It's Joni. Hey! Come on, sit down. Have a seat. Calm down, Joni. Take a deep breathe. Oh, my God. So what's it like, Joni? -What's wrong? -Give me a drink! Boss, get him some water. -Boss, go get it. -Give him a drink. -Calm down. -Take a deep breathe. -Take a deep breathe. -Here it is. Come on. -Boss, take it. -The glass. The glass. That's right. This is really crazy! What's crazy? Listen, Boss, Everyone, when I was approaching the door... ...I was greeted by beautiful girls, who looked like angels. Not like the girls we have here. Our receptionist here has a grumpy face, not beautiful. Are you offended? Continue. And what's even crazier, apart from those beautiful girls... ...the guys are also very handsome. They have a good body, or very athletic. Not like the guys in here, unattractive. -Come on, continue. -Wait, she's talking carelessly. Continue. And they are very classy, Boss. Even the receptionist uses a tablet, not handwritten like ours. After that, they took me on a tour around their laundry business. It's crazy, Boss! They have the newest and most advanced washing machines. They said the machines were made in Germany, not like ours. It's made in North Korea and also in a used condition. All right. Just continue the story. Don't mock our own laundry business. And the ironing room is so neat and very cold. None off them are half naked doing the ironing. Anyway, everything is very advanced over there. And the employees are very tenacious, energetic, very diligent. It's totally different. Not like... Us! I was just getting started with my business, but a new problem has emerged. Either being an employee or a boss, my life is filled with problems. Mrs Maria? -Good morning, Ma'am. -Good morning. -Please, come in. -Right. Right. Please... Come on, hurry up! -Good morning, Ma'am. -Good morning. We have a lot of promo inside. Please, come in. Thank you. We have to make an innovation, if we want to win against that laundry business across the street! That's right! We have to increase our services to our customers! -Right! -You understand, Tiur? -What? -Hey! Halilintar Laundry! Good morning! Can I help you? We are going to give you a fast and satisfying service! Because for us, customers are kings. I don't care if they are very advanced. -We have to be faster! -Right! They say that they are fast as lighting, then we have to be faster... -...as fast as a... -A thunder! Ready? Go! Banzai! Go, go! Yes! Yes! -Kendi, are you ready? -Ready! -Deden, are you ready? -Ready! -One, two, three, go! -Let's do this! Go, go! Oh, my God! After all this time, I thought... ...you are from Ambon. Here, Boss. A snack from Ambon. Maybe you missed it. No wonder the clothes got mixed up often. Thank you, Boss. -Are you ready now? -Ready. -One, two, three! -Freedom! Go, go! Yes! Miss? That guy is so annoying. He's so tacky. Never mind them, Miss. Just let them be. He underestimate me, you know? That's the wrong move! I even oppose my parents who underestimated my business. Let alone that annoying guy! -Who, Miss? -That annoying guy. Hi, Mr Yayan. I'm happy to see you back here again. That's right, Tiur. They say your laundry could get things done faster now. My king. Stop flirting with me, Tiur. Ladies and gentlemen, hurry up and come to Cepat Kilat Laundry. We have a 25 percent discount! Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Please come to Cepat Kilat Laundry. Hurry up, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, come to Cepat Kilat Laundry. To welcome the Ramadan month, we have a special 25 percent discount. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Please visit Cepat Kilat Laundry. There's a discount for everybody. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. Please visit Cepat Kilat Laundry. You call this a healthy business competition? Do you want to keep increasing your discount? This is my business, so it's up to me what I want to do. Is it wrong for me to share to others upon welcoming this sacred month? I understand, but I'm sure you open up this business just to try your luck! For me, this is my life or death! Whether your business is successful or not, I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem for you. Whether you have an income or not, that won't matter to you. You have other incomes out there! This is the only business I got. Please! You think I opened up this business just to fool around? How am I supposed to pay my employees? With leaves? It's even hard to find leaves in Jakarta nowadays. It's all concrete now. Look. I'm not talking about leaves here. Don't change the subject! Hi, Mr Yayan. Where are you going? I'm sorry. I need money to pay rent, so I really need a discount. You're a traitor, Mr Yayan! Hey, do you guys feel something weird about our boss? There's a beautiful girl, instead of dating her, he wages war against her. That's right! That's why our boss is still single. Hey! If we argue with a woman, they will always win. Because women are always right. This has happened since the era of Romeo and Juliet... ...Ken Arok and Ken Dedes, Yakumina and Donatus. It all happened before. Excuse me, but who are Yakumina and Donatus? They are my neighbors in Papua. Hey, stop it you guys! Our boss is struggling for our sake. Don't make fun of him! As for me... ...I feel poor for him. Don't you guys feel poor for him? Boss. Look. The electricity, water and phone bill has been charged. And also the payment for the washing machine maintenance... ...hasn't been paid yet. Thank you, Tiur. -I was first. -It's okay. No problem. In the business world, competition is considered normal, you know? You don't need to make it personal. I'm sorry, Ma'am. But for me, this business is personal. I don't want my business to fail, because of a spoiled little rich girl like you... ...who only do business just for the fun of it. I'm very sorry, Ma'am. How can you judge me like that? Do you think you know me? Maybe you're just a guy who likes to discriminate women... ...and stereotyping them, that they can't make their own business. -You think women are stupid? -Ma'am. What era do you think you're living in? Don't mention anything about discrimination, stereotyping or whatever you call it. My mother also has a business, but she has work ethics. Well... So you're just a mama's boy. All right, don't be sad. Don't cry. Let's just see who will win this one. Will it be me, the spoiled girl, or you, the mama's boy. Thank you. Ma'am, is this true? A fast wash with a 25 percent discount? -That's right. -Okay, here you go. Take these as well. I don't want to go back and forth. -Take these too, okay? -What's the matter with you? -You need to get in line! -Calm down. Oh, my God! Hey, I think our boss has gone crazy. I'm totally sure. I agree. Does he think we have the power of a machine? We keep on working, but will never be rich! I'm really tired! Here are foods for all of you. Happy breakfast. We still have a lot of orders to be done. We need to fulfill our promises and be done according to schedule, okay? If we need to work over time, then we all must do that. Has he ever thought that we are just like Kendi's armpit hair? It's curly, wet, weak and doesn't have any energy. Why did you mention his armpit hair? I have lost my appetite! I have also lost my appetite. Why are you also disgusted by that? Am I not allowed to be disgusted by my own armpit hair? Stop saying that! Wow! Look whose working over night? You don't need to over work yourself. God has arranged our fortune. Bye! She's very concerned with you. She's not concerned. She's just being sarcastic. You don't believe me? Hey, girls are indeed like that, you know? Let me tell you something. If you want to be like in the TV dramas. You can use my cart. When she passes by, just hit her with it. -After that, then it's on. -What's on? Of course you're going to the hospital! You expect her to be your girlfriend? You will go to the hospital, of course. "To welcome the Eid Mubarak, we are offering a special price." "We guarantee your Eid will be free of stains." "May God bless your Eid and be reborn taintlessly." Boss. Is this for real? What about the guys who are taking a leave? Just let them enjoy their vacation. Then we will be short on personnel. I will do it myself. Toto, slow down when you are walking. I can't. I have to finish my orders. -The total is six pieces, right? -Six pieces. -Is that all? -Yes. Okay. Hold on. Let me put these back. Thank you, Sir. Is that a new liquid fragrance? Oh, my God! What a beautiful girl. Mister. Yes, can I help you? I want to ask you something. Do you have a lavender liquid fragrance? It's out of stock We have an ocean fresh liquid fragrance. That would be fine. Here. Hey, you. It appears you have a hard time carrying that, don't you? May I help you? No, that's okay. I can manage. So she's from Bali. Ouch! You see? I want to say something, but please don't be angry. I often see you from across the street. I saw you from behind the window, I'm very eager to get to know you. -But I was afraid. -Why are you afraid? You know that your boss and mine are having a feud or a cold war. How am I not afraid? Well, it's our boss who are having a feud. We commoner has got nothing to do with it. Let's just let them be. That's right! I agree with you! We are meant to be! -What do you mean, meant to be? -Oh, my God. I mean, we are meant to be friends. Friends. But if we are friends now, you need to give me your number, okay? Because with all my friends, they have my number... ...and I have their number. It makes sense, right? Isn't that, right? What's your number? Hey, Kendi. Please sort these out. Boss, do you know what? It turns out that the boss of the laundry across the street... ...is not as bad as you think. She opened her business with her own money, the same like you, Boss. Miss, I have a gossip. It turns out that Mr Uki sold his car, in order to be able to open his business. But I heard that her family is against her laundry business. He even took out his whole entire life savings. Boss? Do you know why they're against it? Because she refused to continue her family's business. Eventually, her family despises her. That's why, he can't lose his business, because that's the only thing he got left. Just try to think with your logic, her own family despises her. He's also fatherless. He has to feed his mother and provide for her. Poor her, right? Don't you pity him? So if his business becomes bankrupt, he will become poor and have no money. Then what will he feed his mother with? A rock? That's why she wants to prove her family that she's serious with her business. She doesn't want to depend on her family. But there's one thing, Boss. They always insult her business. Try to think with your logic. Her family is the one who is insulting her! Hold on a second. Why are you suddenly so concerned about Mr Uki? How did you know all of this? How did you know all of this? Oh, my God! I haven't washed Mrs Susi yet! I mean, I haven't washed Mrs Susi's laundries. So I need to wash it now. Excuse me, Miss. Oh, my God, Boss. I forgot to give some dirty laundries to Todung. Todung, do you feel that everybody here is like a zombie right now? Working hard without any breaks. That's right. Oh, my God! Hey, Ujang and you, fatso! How many times have I told you? If these clothes hasn't dried completely, don't put them in the ironing room! I didn't do that. Maybe it was Ujang. Why me? Don't accuse me for that! Hey, you, African Rhino! Clothes which are still wet like these, if you put them in the ironing room... ...and then we iron it, it will stink like you! Todung, Mrs Ira just complained to me! Here. I wrote three shirts on the bill, but she only got two of them. Where did the other one go? That's your fault. You always miscount the clothes. Give that to me. Let me show you, okay? Well... -It says here, one bed cover. -That's the fact. You have a very small brain! There's six pieces inside it! One bed cover, one bed sheet, two pillow and two long pillow covers. Oh, my God, Todung! Every being on this planet already knows that one set of bed cover... ...consists of one bed cover, one bed sheet, two pillow and two long pillow covers. I don't need to explain it. Use your logic. It's you who has a small brain! You still have to write down how many pieces there are! Don't expect me to read your puny brain of yours... ...every time there is a set of bed cover! -Not everybody use a long pillow! -You don't need to shout! Boss, Toto just had an accident. How is he? He just got a couple of bruises, but his motorcycle is totaled. The laundries he was delivering has also been damaged or dirty. -Damn it! -Boss! Boss, it's Todung and Joni! They're fighting! What do you mean? They are fighting each other! Come on! -Hurry up, Boss! -Tiur, please take care of Toto. All right. -I will flatten you out! -Hey! Stop it! Hey! Deden! Todung! Ouch! -Hey! Kendi, Joni, Todung! -Stop it! All of you, stop it! Hey! Stop! What's the meaning of this? Everything is a mess here! Whose going to pay for all of this? I made this place from scratch, but you destroyed it just like that! Boss, Mrs Maudy comes here and is angry with us. Why is my dress all crumpled like this? Usually this never happened. Honestly, I'm very disappointed! I bought this dress at a very expensive price! I bought it when it had a 90 percent discount. What should I do now? It's not on a discount anymore! That means I can't buy it again! Can you guys even do your jobs? If you can't, just close the damn place! I'm going out of my mind! All of my expensive clothes are ruined! Please explain it to me! Don't just stand there! My clothes are expensive! I want you to pay compensation for this! I can't accept this! I paid here for my laundry! Don't take anymore orders tomorrow. Let's just finish up what we have left. Now you guys should just go home and take some rest. I know all of you haven't been able to get a lot of rest. After that, I will close this laundry business for the meantime... ...until I call you back again. Yes, Mrs Maudy. May I ask for your account number? I will compensate all of it. That's right. I will take responsibility. Boss. Boss, I want to apologize... ...if there's a lot of disappointment in my work. I know that you are a good person. There aren't any boss out there... ...who is willing to hire an old myopic woman like me. I will pray that hopefully your laundry business... ...will open again soon. Take care, Ma'am. -The white girl is mine, okay? -Don't worry, I already got one. -I need to go home now. -Okay then. -See you. -Bye. -Drive safely. -All right. See you. Those crazy guys. Uki! Hi, Uki! -How are you, Man? -Fine. So, what's up? Are you successful now? -Where have you been? -I've just finished eating. Eating? You said, you're successful now. Why are you still eating at a street vendor? Where do you work now? Listen to me. Yes, I eat at a street vendor. But at least my job is giving orders now, not being ordered like you. See you. Good luck! I'd rather be ordered by someone, but I can eat luxurious food! Excuse me, Miss. I need your signature. -Here. -Right. Thank you. Ranti. Has the employees in the other laundry came back to work again? No, they haven't. There's only Mr Uki. Poor him, you know? I think he's doing all the work by himself. I can't imagine. He even buys his own lunch. Usually his employee buys him a chicken noodle across the street. So what do you mean? Nothing, Miss. I just thought you should know. -Who knows? -Who knows what? Who knows? Maybe you are willing to buy him lunch. Why would I buy an arrogant guy like that lunch? Excuse me, if I'm interrupting. I was buying noodles at the street vendor across the road... ...and I also bought one for you. To what occasion? To the occasion of... I'll just put it here, okay? Don't forget to eat it. Why do you bother? Because I know that you... You know what I mean. I need to go now. Bye. Hold on. Yes? There's a chewing gum stuck on your skirt. Damn! It's really stuck. Oh, God. The easiest way to remove it is by putting some ice on top of it. -Like this. -Okay. Well... -That's it. Wait until it's frozen. -Okay. Joni, I have successfully persuaded my boss to buy lunch for Mr Uki. You're a genius, Ranti. Our plan is successful, because of you, Ranti. Without you here, I couldn't have done anything. God, please help me make it happen! Amen! Oh, my God! Now it's frozen. And then, just use our hands. Like this. Wow! It works! It came off, right? And then, the rest of it... ...we brush it off slowly. Wow! There you go. Where did you learn this trick? From my mother. What other tricks does your Mom have? So if you want to bleach a dress with a traditional way... ...you can use a used water from washing rice, and cook it until it boils. And then, soak the dress that has turned yellow into that water. Really? Wow! No wonder you opened up a laundry business like this. It's turns out that you were inspired by your mother. I'm sure she's really proud of you. Why are you silent all of a sudden? Did I say something wrong? Excuse me! Excuse me! -Mr Sastro? -Good afternoon. Why is it so quiet? -Yeah. What is it, Sir? -I've got some laundries. -I'm sorry, Sir, but I can't... -Hold on a second. Come on, bring it inside! I'm very sorry, Sir. This place is temporary closed. -Closed? -That's right. Then why did you put a Ramadan Special Promo? I've made a promise to Tiur that I was going to bring laundries from my company. If this is the case, my boss will be furious. I understand, Sir. But this place is closed for the meantime. All of my employees... We're having a break, Sir. But now we're ready to work again. -Isn't that right? -Right! All of the employees of Halilintar Laundry are ready at your service! -Ganbate! -Banzai! -Freedom! -Nice! That's right, Sir. He just forgot that as of today we can accept orders again. That's what I'm talking about! That's good! What's even better is, how about if we begin right now? -That's right. -Yes, bring them in! Hurry up and bring it in. I'll make the bills. -Excuse me, Sir. -All right. Look, God has already arranged your fortune. You mustn't refuse it. Boss, we're going to pray at the mosque. -All right. -Boss. -Be careful, okay? -All right, Boss. Boss, what are you waiting for? I get it, you know? You hesitate to approach her, but you've already fallen for her to back away. -Hey, it's you. -Hi. -What is it? -Nothing. Have you had dinner? No, I haven't. I want to take you to dinner. Okay. Thank you, Agustina. For what? You were right, when you said... ...that my mother was the one who inspired me. Do you know that all this time, I always follow Aryo Keukeuh's words. -That motivator guy? -Yeah. Don't you know that they've just canceled his show on TV? -What? -It's true. All this time he was just copying the words from economist... ...and modify it a little bit, then he gave it to people. -Are you serious? -Yes. -I must've been really stupid. -Well, sort of. You're so lucky. Why is that? You have a mother... ...who always support you. Who always has your back. One day... One day I'm sure you can make your father proud. We'll see. Here, Ma'am. Please count these, Joni. Thank God! Hey, say your prayers first. This laundry isn't just a business for us, but also our family. Cheers! We should breakfast with some sweets. Then you should eat breakfast with me. I'm as sweet as a date palm, you know? Your skin is like a date palm, but tastes bitter like a medicine. It was funny in Payakumbuh. Ranti, were you able to call Riri and Tomi? Are they coming? Riri is still sick, Miss. Tomi will be on his way here from his hometown tomorrow. But I'm trying to call the others as well. But all the machines are good, right? They're all operational? Some of them hasn't been repaired yet. The spare parts will arrive tomorrow from overseas. What's going on here? It's my father. My father... He... He's testing me. He suddenly orders me to clean... ...all the bed covers and sheets of all his hotels. There's a lot of them. He's doing this on purpose to make me give up. Don't refuse it. You must prove to your father that you can do it. I can't do it, Uki. This is too overwhelming! And there's more tomorrow. How about if I help you do it? If we do it together, we can finish it faster. Okay. -Partners? -Yes, we're partners. Let's do this. Take the finished ones to the pressing room... ...and you've separated them, right? -Process it immediately, okay? -Agustina. Let me introduce you. They are going to help you here. Okay. Meanwhile, the rest of them will do it in my place. I'm very thankful to you guys for helping me out. Just make sure you wash them all clean. Got it, Miss Agus! Agustina. -Got it, Miss Agustina. -Right. -It's all done, Boss. -Good. Ma'am, just put the ones that has been folded right here. -All good, Toto? -All good, Boss. Hi, My little pony. My rabbit. You're also working here? Do you want to get through here? You should go first. No, lady's first. You should go first. It's okay, Joni. You should go first. Oh, my God! Everybody knows that lady's first. -So you should go first, okay? -Cut that crap! "You should go first"? Hurry up! I'm working here! Yeah, you talk to much! I'm going to hit you with this iron. Hurry up and go! It's a green light, you know? Look, my friends are angry. You should go first, okay? Please, Joni. You go first. Give it to me! Damn that Madura guy. Damn that Papua guy. Boss! This is bad, Boss! I have already washed this one. But the stain won't come off! -Have you washed it twice? -More than twice, Boss. They're going to pick this up tonight. Damn, this one is hard to remove. I'm sure my father did this on purpose. If it's not according to standards, I will shutdown your laundry business. So is everything finished? Is it all clean? Yes, Dad. But there are still two of them that we haven't been able to clean. That's right, Sir. There are two missing. Honey, you're entire effort here has been in vain. The result is zero. A big zero! Excuse me. Here are the rest of it. It's all clean. Go and check. Are there still stains on it? -Please help them check. -Let us help you. This is a coffee stain. It's hard to remove, because it hasn't been washed in a long time. As for this one, it's yellow, because this blanket is old. Take a spoon full of vinegar and rub it on the stain. After that, brush it with a tooth brush or with a cloth. This one is yellow, right? Just take a cup of baking soda, mix it with water. Soak it first, and then rinse it. It will become white again. Look, it's clean and spotless. Right, Sir? This is so smooth, just like my skin. Mister. My name is Uki, Agustina's partner. I'm very proud of your daughter. I know how it feels to be in the collapsed position. Unable to run my own business. When I was in that position, she was the one who cheered me up. She taught me how to run a laundry business and many things. You should be proud to have a daughter like her. I never meant to disobey you. I am your daughter, you know? Honey. Now I understand. You have created your own way of live. Please forgive me. Thank goodness! Yes! This is very touching! What do you think you're doing? I'm so happy... ...to see that Agustina can finally prove her hard work to her parents. And it's also time for me to make my mother proud. -Be careful, Honey! -Of course, Mom! Welcome, Uki's mom! They are all my employees, Mom. There's a lot of washing machine, Honey. Of course. So we can accept many orders. I'll send one for you to replace the broken and old one at home. Thank you, Honey. Honey? This is our picture a long time ago. You were just a little boy. Now my little boy has become a man. Capable of running his own business. This is all because of you, because of your hard work. You were the one who taught me all of this. I'm proud of you, Honey. I'm so proud of you. I've just realized that there isn't a better reward in this world... ...other than the expression of a mother who is proud of their son. Kendi, happy Eid Mubarak! Happy Eid Mubarak, everyone! -Happy Eid, Mubarak Ma'am. -Thank you, Boss. Thanks, everyone. Happy Eid Mubarak. -Happy Eid Mubarak, Todung. -Thanks, Boss. Deden. Give my regards to your families! All right, Boss. -Happy Eid Mubarak! -Thanks, Boss. -Have a happy holiday. -Thank you, Boss. Go on. We thought you forgot, Boss. -Thank you, Boss! -Praise God! See you! I'm sorry, Todung. Sorry. -Thank you, Boss. -Bye, Boss! Take care, guys! Are you moved by it? I just never expected that finally I can open up my own business. -Let's go. -Right. Uki, isn't that your role model? Isn't he? You are marvelous! -There's a saying, -You too. When life gives you lemon, make a lemonade. Let's go. This is a key to your success. Don't give up, be a boss, filthy rich and live happily ever after. But for me, when life gives you lemon... ...squeeze the lemon and rub it on the stain on your clothes. I guarantee the stain will be removed. Sir, let me hold it for you. It's okay. I can manage. How about it, Sir? Are we going to wash cars? Snow? It counts as well, right? Good afternoon! -Is this Halilintar Laundry? -That's right, Sir. -Who am I speaking to? -I'm the owner, Sir. I'm Soni, Sir. You know, the one who applied here, the one you called. I see. Listen, if I'm hired to work here, can I stay at this place? Because my house is far in Depok. But come to think of it, I don't dare to stay here alone. And what about my parents? They'll be far away from me. Hey, I think our boss has gone crazy. I'm totally sure. I agree. Does he think we have the power of a machine? We keep on working, but will never be rich! I'm really tired! Kendi, don't you want to continue my words, so it'll sound funny? I can't do that. I think I can't be funny anymore. I should just tell the director to cut. The director? Director, cut!
