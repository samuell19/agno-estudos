[Birds chirping] - [girl whispers] Wake up! - [Gasps] [clay tile shatters] [chirping continues] John! I would keep my distance if I were you. Hey! Have you lost your mind? Look at you! [Louise] We're not done talking about this. "Your eyes are bigger than your stomach." My Nana used to say that to me when I put more food on my plate than I was able to eat. [Louise] We'll talk her into changing it. No, there's no talking my mother into anything... Which is why she doesn't even know there is a "we" yet. If you don't stop her, you'll be left with nothing. We'll be left with nothing. [Radio static crackles] Don't you get tired of people trying to talk you into being a man? [Classical music playing on radio] I never told you what happened to my sister, Kathleen. She was only six when it happened. She loved the water. She loved to play games. We buried her right over there. Don't think I don't know what you're up to. I told you what I'd do the next time you put your hands on me. Yeah? Why don't you tell me again, Louise? [John screams] [both grunting] [screams] [Louise grunts] [classical music continues playing] - [John yells] - [grunts] [shouting] [screams] [panting] Goodbye, Johnny. [Splashing] [static crackles, classical music stops] [engine stops] [Gloria] Stop fussing. Just trying to be a gentleman. A real gentleman doesn't have to try. Do you need any help? [Dale] No, I got these. Go ahead. Okay. Old place looks good. [Gloria] Looks can be deceiving. [Rose] Ready? Well, it certainly smells the same. Thought John would have opened some windows. John? - [Girl whispering] Rose. - Yes? I didn't say anything. I'm gonna go find John. John? You in here? [Gasps] [stammers] Louise. I didn't expect to see you. I didn't hear you come in. I was in the shower. Where's John? Probably on the lake. You know how he loves the water. That's weird. What's weird? The cheval. It's missing. And the oriental rug. The cheval? Yes, the cheval. The antique claw-foot mirror. It's missing. Neither were here when we arrived. I've been using the mirror in the bathroom. [Gloria] Rose, did you find Johnny? Not yet. But I found something else. [Gloria] You know I don't like surprises. [Rose] You're going to love this. Why don't you get dressed? We'll see if we can find John. You two didn't... Oh. We did. Two weeks ago. You like my ring? Of course I came back. I always come back. Mommy loves you very, very much. [Rose] Who are you talking to? Come on. Come meet John's lovely wife. What? So, what do you think of Castle Haloran? Uh, it's... Something. Big. Cold. Almost feels like you're being watched. Well, they say Castle Haloran is haunted. Oh. By Kathleen? I'm sorry. I... No need. You didn't kill her. Did you? Mrs. Haloran, if I did something to upset or offend you... I haven't seen John, my oldest, in almost a year. About the same time your so-called relationship started. Where is my son? [Rose] Mom. John isn't here. Yeah, I thought he'd be on the water. [Girl] Help me. I guess he left before dawn. He said he wanted to get an early start. [Girl] Mommy? I'm over here. Mom, are you okay? [Girl] Can't you see me? [Mouthing] - Let's get her inside. - [Murmuring] Come on. Never speak my sister's name to her again. Understand? How's she doing? Uh, she's better. Resting. I didn't bring up Kathleen. - Your mother... - It's done. I keep telling her these annual memorials are too traumatic. It's like she's only comfortable when she's torturing herself. Or the rest of us. [Chuckles] It's hard for people to let things go. John, in particular? I saw the bruises. I didn't believe John's ex-wife at first either. But nobody deserves to be treated that way, Louise. No amount of money is worth it. I have enough to worry about, keeping this family together. I don't want to have to look after you, too. Where the hell is he anyway? He better be back when Billy and that boyfriend of hers get here tomorrow. [Sighs] [cell phone beeps] [scoffs] Bitch. [Radio static crackles] [exhales] Now I'm missing the game for this? [Sighs] Who has a castle and doesn't have one TV in the whole place? Who has a castle? Anyone who can afford one. When you have enough money, a castle's just another toy. What's that? One of my father's old books. Ten Tales from Japan. [Shudders] These are creepy. [Rose] They're Japanese theater masks. [Clanking] That's a Hannya mask. The Hannya is a woman so consumed with rage and jealousy, she transforms into a demon. - [Growling] - [chuckles] - Are they all different? - Mmm-hmm. These particular masks are different forms of demons and ghosts in the Noh theater tradition. Quality family time. Looks like one's missing. Keep trying the radio. Morning. I'm going for a run. Yeah? I could use a run. You want some company? Um, you know what? That's okay. I prefer to run alone. It's a mental thing. No worries. See you later. Mmm-hmm. What? [Alarm chirps] Hey. Change of plans. Two more are coming up today. A couple. I don't want to know the details. It doesn't matter. Just get this done. Don't mess it up like the last time. Okay? I've spent too much time on this. [Man whispering] Louise. [Rustling] [girl whispering] I'm up here. [Rustling continues] Come and find me. [Rustling] [girl laughs] [toy xylophone melody playing] [man whispering] I'm over here. [Man chuckling] [chuckling continues] [twig snaps] Argh! [Gasps] No! [Whimpering] [panting] [whimpering] - No! No! - [Squelches] [gasping] Hey. [Coffee pouring] - You hungry? - I am. Good. I made fresh-squeezed orange juice. - Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm. It's actually harder than it looks. [Chuckles] Clearly. [Chuckles] Clearly. All of it's harder than it looks. [Phone buzzes] Nobody ever said family was easy. Looks like Louise is meeting up with John. One less thing to worry about. Good. [Gloria] Of course. They're coming. This time will be different. We'll all play. Look what you did. You made a mess. No, you did. Don't blame him. Mother? I'd like some time alone with my daughter, if you don't mind. [Gasps] And take off that cross. Kathleen doesn't like it. - [Girl giggles] - [doorbell rings] It's an actual goddamn castle. More like a mausoleum. Where is everybody? - [Doorbell rings] - And watch your language. Don't give them another reason to hate you. Copy. - Wait. - [Sighs] They hate me? Hey. Look who it is. You must be Carl. It's Kane, actually. I go by Kane now. Kane. Cool. Sorry. I didn't mean to invade your safe space. Well, come on in, come on in. Just finished cooking breakfast, if you're hungry. Kane. We were in Goa. Yeah? Where's that? Goa. On the coast of India. It's real beautiful, but kind of messed up at the same time. Then mainland India. Mumbai for a while. That's why we left. It's like hell on Earth. Worse than Goa. I mean, we were fine, but, you know, the way they treat people, like, you know... Not the foreigners, but the Indian people. The locals, man. When are you gonna grow up? What are you talking about? What's next? Paddleboarding in the Galapagos or teaching yoga in Haiti? Run as far across the globe with Kanye as you want. Can't hide from real life forever. Should I retire at 30 to the Upper East Side with you? Wait for Mother to die so I can afford a bigger apartment? [Faint chattering] We saw a wedding procession run over a beggar in the street. The first one hit him. And then the second one, no one blinked. Just kept going over him, man, like he was a freaking speed bump. Mmm. What did you do? What are you gonna do? When in Mumbai... As soon as the last car passed, some old lady ran out of nowhere, stole his shoes. The money's not gonna last forever. You better start learning to live without it. [Chuckles] I'm okay with nothing. What about you? Hmm? What about him? Where's John? Where's Johnny? He had to go back to New York for business. He's gonna try to make it back for the ceremony. You know how it is, Mother. Business. Money. The key to everything and nothing. Do you know how this family made its money? [Rose] Mother. Time and a place. My great-great-great-grandfather was a bobbin boy in a textile mill. He replaced thread, fixed machines. Sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. An immigrant with a clubbed foot. He worked his way up and bought the company and... This isn't the right time. He sold slave clothing. And that's how this family made its fortune. Greed and blood money. [Chuckles] Okay. Maybe we should just take a second... When you go to sleep, do you ever feel like you've accomplished anything? I thought you were supposed to be smart. Failed business after failed business? Look, I don't care where you put your prick. At least that shows you've got some sort of drive. [Giggles] He doesn't come to the ceremony. It's family only, and he's not family. The real measure of wealth... Is how much you'd be worth if you lost it all. How much are any of you really worth? What the hell are you talking about? "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing." And, "A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children. "The wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous." [Laughing] That's in the same Bible verse that you just rambled off. - [Slams table] - You consider yourself righteous? Absurd! The only pure one left is Kathleen. These halls will be a sanctuary for all children. This isn't about money! The papers are signed, I'm just waiting for Johnny to look them over. This is about your constant desire to destroy this family! - [Pitcher shatters] - What the... Kathleen knows. She knows which one of you did it. I'll die before I let you take this place from her with your... [loud banging] [Dale] What the hell? Whoa. I mean, you said your mother was losing it, but that was... That was beyond Percocets. She can't just... I mean, there's gotta be some law against... [chuckles] Charity? No. This is my birthright. A castle and a thousand acres is your birthright? You don't understand the shit that I had to grow up with. It's all good, babe. Money isn't everything. They say after, like, $75,000 a year, more money doesn't make you any happier. We don't need material things. - We got each other. - [Scoffs] Fuck that. [Rock music playing on radio] Go get some ammo. What was that for? Go get some ammo. - Didn't have to hit me. Dang. - Go! Move your ass! Can I help you? Yeah. Three packs of nine millimeters. Hollow points. Here you go. - How much? - $75. [Cashier] Something wrong? Yeah. Why don't you give me all the money in the register? Did you get her? No. Straight to voice. This bitch better not be getting cold feet. [Gun firing] [Perry] He shot me! What the... What the hell happened? Stupid son of a bitch! Who told you to rob the place? You got to take me to the hospital. No, I don't. I'm gonna die. You gotta take me to the... [Ray] No hospitals. It looks pretty bad. Ray, please. Would you shut up? I'm dying. Take me, or I'm singing! Just butch up and shut your mouth. You understand? Wood, please, man. Just drop me off. I don't wanna die. [Gun firing] You know, I never did like that kid. [Gasps] Arthur. [Chuckles] Oh. Sorry to sneak up on you. I come to fix the door here. Miss Haloran called me not too long ago. It's nice to see you. It's been a while. Uh, yes, it has. Any idea how that ax got wedged in there in the first place? Probably the local kids. No respect for the property. Local kids? They throw axes into people's doors? You know, I been meaning to call you. I have seen Mrs. Haloran around the property, playing games, children's games, by herself. And having full conversations. She's getting worse. I thought these retreats would do her some good, jog her memory. They're just getting harder and harder for her. I'll leave you to it. It's nice to see you. And I've, uh... Made preparations for the ceremony. Four o'clock on the east lawn. Yes. Thank you. - [Arthur] Billy! - Hey! How's the world traveler? Thirty-eight passport stamps and counting. Uh, this is my boyfriend, Kane. Konnichiwa. Why don't you show Kane around while I get ready for the ceremony? I'll see you in a bit. Okay. [Kane] So, I'm sure you've seen your fair share, working for this family. Any crazy stories? This is a family that respects loyalty. And I respect this family. Fair enough. When I got back from the war, they took me in and helped me to become myself again. Uh, what'd you do in the war? I put men back together God didn't mean to be put back together. That was a super-awkward way of saying you were a medic. This is where all the passages lead, some way or another. Yeah, I can't believe there's secret passages in this place. Like walk-through bookshelves kind of thing? Well, something like that. Tunnels. Secret passages. [Scoffs] I've been here for 30 years, and I bet I still don't know them all. Thirty years? So, you, uh... You must have been here for the... You know, the Kathleen thing. Oh, yeah, that was a sad day. Mr. Haloran was a generous man. He invited one of the local fellas up here to use the grounds for his wedding. Kathleen was all dressed up like a flower girl. Billy and Rose, too. It was a beautiful day... Before... - [water splashing] - [Kathleen] help! Help me! Help... I've never been a fan of weddings. They always... Always felt more like funerals. Why is that? In order for a new life to begin, the old one has to end. So do you really plan on giving it away, or... Was that just part of the show? We never deserved it in the first place. We should have given it away a long time ago. Given you girls a chance at a real life. I'll come get you in half an hour. This is the access point. You got a flashlight? Why would I have a flashlight? Here. This leads to the cellar of the main manor. There are old wine vaults and storage along the way. If you're feeling adventurous, you could take one of the side tunnels that lead to the exit near the lake, or by the gatehouse. There's nothing to be frightened of. [Scoffs] Yeah, this is a bad idea. Yeah, I think I'll pass. Thanks for scaring the shit out of me, though. [Priest] For you created my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. I know this full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. What's with the fences around the tombstone? [Rose] They buried the Japanese workers who built the place all around here. Just threw them into an open pit throughout the construction as they died. Covered it up after they finished. My dad used to say their souls were trapped in the bricks of the walls because of it. - All the days ordained for me... - [girl] Mommy. Were written in your book before one of them came to be. How precious are your thoughts to me, O God. How vast the sum of them. If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. [Girl] Mommy. [Softly] Mommy's here. I'm scared. Where are you going? You're not Kathleen. [Low, distorted male voice speaking] - Oh! - Whoa! Let's get her to the house. - Grab the other side? - Yes. All right. We got her. [Cell phone buzzes] Whoa. What the hell happened? [Priest] Open the door. - Sure. - Let's get her inside, sit her down. She'll be fine. Where's Rose? I don't know. [Exhales] [pills rattling] [door creaks] [girl laughing] [footsteps approaching] [Kathleen whispers] Billy. I'm gonna get you. [Clattering] John? [Man whispering] Rose. [Phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] [squeals] [squeals] [grunts] No sign of Rose. What's with the women in this family? Where's John? Where's Johnny? John's not here. He went back to New York. Find John. He's the only one who can talk to her. Talk her out of it. Talk her out of what? [Door slams] [gasping] Rose? What happened? We have to go. We have to leave. Now! We can't. Kathleen won't let us leave. What is it? - He's coming. - Who? - [Pounding on door] - [Rose shudders] - What the hell was that? - Oh, shit! Oh, my God! [Panting] Oh, tell me you have a gun in the house. In the study. Watch them! I'll be right back! [All gasping and whimpering] [vehicle approaching] - Somebody's coming. - Yeah. - [Kane] Who's that? - I don't know. [All gasping] - Oh! Go! - No! Don't! Is he dead? You know that guy? No, I think he was trying to break in. We need to call the cops. Yeah, that won't be happening. Get inside. Inside! Where's Louise? I don't know. We don't know. She said she was going for a run. She didn't come back. Whatever you're here for, whatever you came here to do, I'm sure we can come to some sort of an agreement. I can't search this place by myself. This place is huge. I'm gonna ask one more time. Is there anybody else in this house? No. - [Gasps] - Don't lie to me! [Priest] Hey, we're cooperating. There's no need for violence. Who was that outside? I don't know. There's supposed to be two couples here. One... Where's Dale? How do you know their names? [All gasp] [Ray] I'm the one that's asking the questions here. Where the hell is he? You killed him. The man in the mask. He was playing a prank. He's dead. If you're lying, someone's getting shot. [Wood] He's gone. Bullshit. I put three in his chest. [Wood] He's gone. Find him. Before he calls somebody. [Door closes] [Billy] Why are you doing this to us? Oh, please. Don't be stupid. Why do you think? You think you're the first lowlife to try and steal from this family? Much better men and women have been coming after us for years. Real thugs. Lawyers. Politicians. Billionaires. Not some hoodlum in a ski mask. You know, you can tell the measure of a man by the weapon he brings to battle. Where do you think pistols and open palms fall on the scale of... [all gasp] Oh! You were saying? [Sobbing] [doll] Come play with me. [Wood muttering] [doll] Don't go. Move the priest. Bro, I can't. Please don't make me. I can't. [Gun cocks] Yeah. Okay. I'm on it. Oh, God, he's still warm. Dale, call the police. I tried. My phone's dead. Go. Get help. [Door opens] - Did you find him? - No. Somebody's messing with us, Ray. I mean, do you really trust this girl? Because I sure as hell don't. This was all her idea, and she's not even here. She's setting us up to be some sort of... - Some... - Patsy? Hey, let's just ride off into the sunset, huh? Like Butch and Sundance. Butch and Sundance died in the end. I never actually saw it. Get upstairs and toss the rest of the rooms. Do you understand? We are not leaving here with our dicks in our hands. Take her with you. Go! How long have you been working with Louise? It's none of your business. Did you kill John? Enough with the questions! [Girl laughing] Is that a kid in there? No. [Laughing continues] You move, and I'll shoot you. Hey! - Open the door! - [Pounding on door] Open the door! [Girl laughing] [giggling] [thumping] I got no sense of humor. [Girl laughing] And you're messing with the wrong motherfucker. [Scraping] [gasping] [creaking] Ray! [Wood whimpering] [girl laughing] Step back from the door! [Wood] No. No, don't! [Gun fires] [creaking] [groans] [footsteps approaching] [gun fires] [engine stalling] No, no, no. Come on. Something's wrong. They wouldn't just leave us here. What, you want them to come back? Now's our chance. There's no need to worry. Kathleen will save us. [Billy] Mother, now is not the time. Kathleen, untie these ropes, dear. Kathleen is dead, okay? Gone. And if we don't find a way out of here, so are we. Billy had nothing to do with it. Tell her. - What? - Tell her. I don't know what you're talking about. Kathleen, please. She wants you to confess. What? Confess what? [Gloria] You have to confess. Mom, stop. Please. [Gasps] Oh, my God. [Kane] What is it? [Sobbing] You don't see it? See what? [Shuddering] [Gloria] Confess. No! - [Gloria] Confess! - I didn't call for help! [Continues sobbing] I was scared. I was eight. I thought I would get in trouble. [Billy continues sobbing] [engine starts] [screaming] [intense thudding] [thudding continues] - Oh, thank God. - Where are they? Just untie us. [Screams] [whimpering] [screams] Help! [Panting] - Get away from me! - It's me! Calm down. You're safe. We have to go. He may come back. - Rose. - Stay away from me. - Rose. - Stay away from me! Rose! Where's Rose? I'm not leaving without her. We have to go get help! All right. Fine. - Bro! Is this blood back here? - What? - Bigger fish, Carl. - It's Kane. - [Engine stalling] - What? -Come on. - No. No. That's impossible. Kathleen will never let us leave. She wants us to stay with her forever. Why is it so cold in here? [Dale] Shit. Holy shit! [Screaming] Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Rose. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Dale! - [Groans] - [gasps] [screaming] Come on! Kane! Kane, come on! [Sobbing] Rose, come on! [Continues sobbing] No! No! [Breathing heavily] [panting] [exclaims] That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. [Exhales sharply] [girl laughing] [laughing continues] I swear to God I'll shoot a kid. Peekaboo! [Projector whirring] [gasps] I'm sorry, Rose. Arthur? I didn't know it was going to turn out like this. It was you all along? [Rose] You killed Dale, after all our family has done for you! He said he needed my help. I didn't know it was going to turn out like this. Why would Dale need your help? No. Not Dale. Who? [All gasp] [screaming] [sobbing] [hammer hits floor] No, no, no. There's no need for that. It's just us now. Johnny. Hello, Mother. Rose. Hey, Billy. Remember that day? Happier times. Johnny. What happened to you? Oh, there's just not enough time in the day, or the night, to explain it all to you, my dear mother. Mmm! It's a long story. Turns out, Louise... You were right, by the way. She was working me from the beginning. She was working us. She thought she was going to fuck her way straight to the bank. And I should've known better, but she begged me to marry her. And she hired these clowns to come out here and torture us, extort us, kill us. I was not a fan of that. I know, I know, anything that flies, floats, or fucks, you should rent, right? But... [sniffs] Well, thankfully, Kathleen took care of the rest. Oh, my God. You're just as crazy as she is. Am I? Everything that happens tonight, from the cops' point of view, is gonna be on their tab, so it's actually perfect. You killed Dale. Yeah. I did you a favor. [Chuckling] Marrying Dale... Was like betting on a horse with no legs. Tell her, Mom. You don't have to pay alimony to a corpse. We don't. Because that is what this is about. Family. Us. Keeping things the way they have always been. You're a murderer. You tried to kill me! Yeah, well, I got to admit, you're quicker than I thought. What's stopping you? What do you want? [Gun cocks] You're so grown up, Billy, it's unbelievable. It would be a little odd if the police showed up and I was the only one left standing, and lo and behold, the entire estate transferred to me. Mom, I didn't even look at that contract, by the way. An orphanage? For charity? Are you kidding me? [Chuckling] What's wrong with you? I think 50-50 is pretty equitable, but I'm not going any lower than 50. What? He wants one of us to kill her. Mother. That's what all this is about. The money. Why don't you just do it yourself? Billy! I need one of you to vouch for me. And you gotta have a little dirt on you for anybody to trust you. And what happens to the other one? Billy, you can't be serious. You can't be. We're a family. Oh, please. When are you going to grow up? Good. I was hoping it was gonna be you. Which one do you want? Sorry, Rose. Billy, don't do this. - Wilhelmina! - You know how much I hate that name! Just... Don't think about it. I've never killed anyone before. Don't be so sure. Shut up! Here. This helps to take the edge off. [Pills rattling] I mean, I don't have to tell you. It'll be just like old times. I'm sorry, Rosemary. I really do wish I had given it all away a long time ago. Me too. Even though you are a bitch... I really wish I didn't have to do this. - [Gun fires] - Go! [Gasps] [John grunts] - [screams] - You double-crossing bitch! [Screaming] [grunts] [gasping] Come on! Come on! [Gloria sobbing] No! Come on! Come on. Come on. - I can't. - Come on. - I can't. - We have to go. Come on. [Mumbling] No. - We have to go, Mom. - I can't. [Groans] [John] Thank God for painkillers. You know, Louise really did me a favor. Getting half your face shot off is a hell of an alibi. I'm sorry, Mother. This doesn't mean I don't love you. I just have to fully commit at this point. Go to hell. What do you say, Rose? You and me? Fifty-fifty? Okay. Suit yourself. Wait! Wait. I need to know. What happened to my Kathleen? - Tell me. - Just be still, Mother. Be still. Always such a soft spot, to the point where you can't even see straight. Which I guess made this all the easier. What happened to you? What happened to me? That's a funny question coming from the girl who killed her little sister. That's not true. Rose... It isn't true. Like hell it isn't, Mom. I wasn't even there. Billy didn't even show up until after. It was an accident! I didn't kill her! [Door slams] [loud thudding] [clattering] Time's up. No! [Loud thud] Who else is in this house? I don't know. [Loud thud] - Who else is in this house, Rose? - I don't know! [Thudding continues] - She's here. - Shut up. [Low voice] I know what you did. [Wheezing laughter] Hey, Kathy. It's me, Johnny. Remember how much fun we used to have? I was your favorite. Tell her what you did, Rose. This isn't real. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. Tell her. I did it! I did it. I pushed you in. I watched you drown. I'm sorry, Kathleen. I'll pray for you. [Distorted voice] You'll pray? No! No! No! No! No! [Screaming] [continues screaming] No! Please. I did everything you asked. What else do you want from me? [Softly] You'll die here. You'll never leave. [In low voice] You'll die here. [Indistinct whispering] You'll never leave. [Indistinct whispering] [laughing]
