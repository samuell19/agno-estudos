Shincine The Fox Girl Ko Soyoung Doggo Youngjae Jeong Wooseong Bahng Eunhee Why do you do this to me? What did I do wrong? Yes, I went to the sauna during business hours-so what? It was only 5 minutes. Today, messenger No. 69 received a mission from the Judge of Hell, He will go to the earth and find the last fox girl Who's trying to become a human being. He will either take her Or kill her and bring her dead body to hell. If he does not succeed he'll be released of his duty. his tongue will be cut off, and he'll suffer in hell. Stop. Stop the train. You've got the wrong one. It's not 69, it's 96. Hey, stop. I said, it's 96. It's not 69. What do we do? We did it again? Not my fault. I followed the paper work. Not mine, either. I checked the signature. Who is he replacing with? How could an office worker like me perform a special mission like this? This is bullshit. This is wrong big time. Do I look like a person who could accomplish such a mission? You wouldn't think so, right? I just went to the sauna, that's all. This must be a big screw up. - Gisoo, 15 more days. - What difference does it make? You promised me. You wouldn't do this for 100 days. Now, we will play by my rules. I'm sick of playing with the marble. Let's change the rule. Then, I can give you real pleasure. - If you love me, you can't do this. - Love? For whom? It's fine and dandy with you but, what about me? What do I get? Gisoo. This is what I want. Stop it! If this is what you want fine Do it. There were only 15 days left. Excuse me, Where is Bangbae-Dong? Christ. Damn useless lottery. This really sucks. Do you happen to know where Bangbae-Dong is? You don't know that you are in Pusan? Damn train. This really sucks. Anyway, How can I get there? First, you have to go to Seoul Either by plane or by train - And then take it from there. - O.K. Or, you could get in a cab. O.K. By the way, what is a cab? Mister, where are you from? Are you from the north? You could say that. If you are from the north I'm a criminal at this moment. Since I talked to a spy and Let him know the way to Seoul I'll get arrested for that. You know what I mean? What's a spy? You aren't from around here. I wouldn't deny that. I can get 50 million for turning in a spy. Let's go. Wait, what are you doing? Dead or alive, I can still get the money. What's the Reds? Come on. You choose, either move or get your ass kicked. You must've made a fortune driving a cab. I'll count to three. One. Don't push it. Two. You want to die? - Three. - You, bastard. - Stop. - I said, stop. Start the car. Hey, Thank you. I'll get off here. - What's this? - I get it, okay? You want fresh air, right? There, are you happy? You can have fresh air and, I can smoke Isn't that what democracy is all about? Let me get this straight. Driving for you or not is my call. Isn't this perfect? You go to Seoul, I make money. Look at that. See? Just one mistake could bring tragedy like that on a highway. That's why you shouldn't get on the driver's nerves. Otherwise, you will go to hell where the King of Hell is. Are you from there, too? What's your mission? I'm here to catch the fox girl. That's enough. I put out my cigarette. OK? Why doesn't the smoke come out of your ears? Please let me alone. The fox girl, Let me off here. Hey, you didn't pay. No. Hanshin Officetel Come in, the door's open. Welcome, master. This isn't it. It's wrong. No, you're in the right place. I'm your only disciple. No, you are not. I'm the one. Let me see. You have the wrong portrait. This is way wrong. Am I this ugly? Look at this almond shaped eyes. This isn't a pretty picture. No, it's the fox girl.... The fox girl? How could you... You made me sick for 3 years to have me as your disciple, Now, this is what I'm getting? - I said, I have to get the fox girl... - Ahhhh, stop saying that word. How could you do this to me? - OK, grandpa. - Grandpa? You wouldn't believe I'm your disciple... This might refresh your memory. You must be mistaken. I come from hell to catch the fox girl. The fox girl again, Bastard. Come back, please. You can't leave me like this. You are always in my land. - Isn't the 'Orange' bar nice? - I don't think so, not any more. That's not true. I went there yesterday and I had a great time. Pick one you don't like. You don't have preferences. You said you like that place, too. Good bye. You are... You helped me the other day, didn't you? I don't think so. Hey, that's really cliche. Try something better. - I wanted to thank you. - You got the wrong person. I'll never forget your kindness. Take care. I found this in the forest. I thought this might be yours. If not, just take it. This is a cab not a bus. There, have one more. Jangheung - Ri, We'll pay double. Others think that you are human, but I can see your tails. This isn't working. - What? I'm on a mission. - We are on a mission, too. You get tokens for taxi fare? - I knew it. - We never have good luck. You know why people like us commit crimes? Because of useless bastards like you. We will teach you a lesson. If you don't have money, you should die. Otherwise, something like this Will not happen. Are you okay? I didn't run over you, right? Gosh, I was scared. I was robbed, help me. Stand by the side of the road, not in the middle of it. If not, people will think you want to kill yourself. Damn it, I said I was robbed. And be patient, wait for help. - Please help. Don't worry. Do what I say. I'll see you later. You! You bastard. Look, all we want to know is the number under the name. so we can find out who you are or if you have any criminal record. You were born here, right? It's kind of complicated. You are an anarchist and you have a criminal record, right? I have no idea what you're talking about. If you don't cooperate, I'll send you to hell. I'd appreciate it. I don't think I can capture the fox girl, so... I'll do whatever if you could send me back to hell. - Lf that's what you want. - Thanks. Later, let me know what the Judge of Hell looks like. No problem. Do you have a phone? How do you drink your coffee? I asked how you would drink your coffee? What do you mean how? With my mouth, I guess. Is there any other way? Some people drink it from somebody else's mouth. Do you want to try that? Do you always get picked on by people like this? Not always but, I could say I have bad luck. How could you say such a thing? I thought you'd be a little more grateful. I saved you and cared for you with all my heart and you say you have bad luck? Until I met you, yes, I was pretty unlucky. I thought this kind of luck would happen in the movies. I still think that this is a dream. But it doesn't matter. Do you still think this is a dream? Maybe I didn't hit you hard enough. I can slap you harder. This is okay since it's a dream. Sorry, I didn't mean to do this... actually I wanted to do this. I'm actually... I won't give you a lame excuse. I'm sorry. I don't know if this makes you feel any better but I wasn't just fooling around. I can't explain how but, I... Forget it. I'm really sorry. I'll just leave. Please don't leave me. You're saying I'm the one who dumped you? Why? The sun was too hot on that day. Hey, you think you owned the phone? Get lost, asshole. Damn it. Why am I so damn smart? Maybe it's because I'm well educated. It's a little noisy but a good place for meditation. I am not much of a talker. Instead I chew gum. It makes me feel good. You want to try it? Pay me 500 won. It's a bargain. You want it for free, huh? But if you want something. You have to pay for it. You cheap bastard. Mom, mom, mom See this? There's no bad vibe between you and your brother. You even had a good relationship with him in your previous life. I think it's the emotion between.... Excuse me for a second. Now I know why they cut people's tongue in hell. We'll talk about it later. I'm working now, be quiet. Spit it out and go to sleep. I'll buy you more later. If you keep humming, every guy in this room would cry. Why is that? Because everybody will know that you are in love. You're right, Sooyoung. He's coming over at 8. You're fired. You picked a fight somewhere and you are telling me that you were robbed? I wasn't born yesterday. Don't even think about lying to me. You think I'm that stupid. You're fired. Boy! What do we do now? I don't know. All I know is she's trying to be a human and this is her last chance so, she's going to pick a dumb ass try to suck the spirit out of him. What's your plan? I have no idea. That's enough. By the way, what does she truly look like? As soon as you see it, you'll be dead. I know it's only a disguise but, she's so beautiful. I'd die for that look. That's nonsense. You are much prettier than her. - Is it good? - Of course. But I am hungry. Again? Minhee Whatever happens We should trust each other. I won't betray you. I can swear. Then swear, Hyuk. I swear. - Can I touch you now? - Close your eyes. Didn't swear like 5 minutes ago? Close your eyes. You are the one who doesn't trust me. I am not a kind of guy who peeks when a girl gets undressed. I've been waiting for you. Damn, my gum. Harah... Harah You determine others' fate on your own. Do you have any idea how many spirits had to be dragged to hell against their will simply because they woudn't accept their fates and tried to carve out their own fortunes? Cut the bullshit. Everything in the world has their own destiny. If you are a fox, That's your destiny to follow How dare you try to break the laws of nature? Those aren't the laws of nature, You made them up. Let's see what kind of luck you've got. If you are the best shot for them, there aren't any useful ones left in hell. That's what I'm saying. I'm not supposed to be here. All I did was complaint about the train system in hell In consequence, they put me in the train and sent me here. You sneaky little rat! You're one of a kind. Like others, you try to beg your life by saying you were sent by mistake? It's true. Die honorably. Believe me. I went to the sauna. Good bye. Harah, Harah If I ever see you again, lt'll be your last day. Keep in mind. Nobody can stop me. Where are you? Harah Harah - I'm here. - Harah Hyuk, what's wrong? Don't leave me alone, okay? I won't. Especially when I wake up. Okay. She is the fox girl. Harah, the thing is... Do you know what's the first thing I noticed about you? This smell of yours. You'll be racing in the fall? Maybe. You recognized me. After all, it's a small world, isn't it? You. I'm really sorry about what happened. I couldn't help you. Anyway, you met this rich girl because of me. She pegged you. - You look totally different. - Who the heck are you? I'm a private detective Your girlfriend hired. Let's go together. Where are you going? - What is it, Hyuk? Is it something - I said? Shut up. Hyuk, what's going on? Hyuk Hyuk, don't do this, please. You promised me whatever happens... I can't tell you why right now but... Hyuk, I love you. Hyuk, I do love you. If you say that one more time, I'll kill you. I swear. Hyuk, I fell in love with you the moment I saw you but, I didn't know who you are, what you do or where you live. I wanted to know. - Did you hire the robbers? - No, I didn't. I swear. You thought you could treat me like that? You thought I'd be grateful anyway? Tell me why you're doing this to me. Why you needed so many traps to get me. Hyuk, I love you. That's all. You would think I have an inferiority complex. That's not true. Maybe, I do. I couldn't even dream of doing half of the things you do. - Hyuk, I'm sorry. Forgive me. - No, it's all my fault. I had promised to trust you and I broke it. Hyuk, stop it. Don't make me do this again. - Hyuk - Harah - I thought I'd lose you. - I felt the same way. Hyuk, wait, wait. Harah, relax. Let me handle this. Harah Harah Harah Harah Harah Harah Harah You are quite smart. Who are you? It isn't easy for humans like you to tell fox girl. Who are you? I came from hell to save you and the thing in your hand is the fox girl's tail. That's right. She is a 999 year-old fox girl. No, actually she turned 1000 years old this year. This year is the last chance for her to become human and you are the last chance she's got. You thief, You broke into somebody's house to steal and say such a thing? Get lost before I call a cop. You stupid human, you'll get your spirit sucked by her and be destined to die in two days. Stupid human, you'll die. - Why did you hit me? - I'm going to kill you. I thought you already lost your power to the marble but, you still have some. Now you know what I'm saying. She is sucking your spirit with the marble. In two days, she'll be human and you'll be a corpse. There's only one way for you to survive. When she takes out the marble, swallow it. Don't let her find out. If she doesn't take out the marble, you're screwed. Good luck. - How did it go? - He finally accepted the truth. - I told you not to piss me off. - I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Pissing you off? Actually, I have seizures. It's a disease. It's not epilepsy though. I'll be fine after a couple of days treatment. - Horrible, isn't it? - No, I don't care. You're lying. You look quite disgusted. That's not true. I'm sorry. Nothing's changed. You are still you. Hyuk, when I get better after two days... I don't care how many days or how many years it takes. I'll be with you forever. Hyuk He's really good. If I were her, I would believe him. Men are all thieves. It can't be true. What's going on here? How come he didn't do what I said? Humans are more stupid than I thought. Maybe we are the stupid ones. No way, this is a kind of a deal for them. She can get his spirit and he gets money and pleasure in return. They both get something from this relationship. If not, they won't do this. I want him to use it, so what? For me, they seem to be in love with each other. Deeply. How do you know that? You don't know it, you feel it. How do you feel it? You just feel it, it's hard to explain. I'll get some sleep. Good night. After capturing the fox girl tomorrow, I'm going back to hell right away. Then, this would be the last night, huh? Looks like it. Just like that. I guess. Then, have a good night hanging upside down. Wait. This is just a good bye kiss So, don't get me wrong. She can't attack me unless she wants to reveal. herself in public. - What's wrong? - I dropped something. - Are you okay? - I have a stomach cramp. I'm not surprised. You had a big lunch. Let's get out. Would you stop swinging your arms? This is a theater not a pool, you know? - I'm just... - They are leaving. There. Hyuk, I have to go to the bathroom. - Start the car and wait for me. - I will. Did you get her? She seemed okay to me. You can't say that. She must be in a lot of pain right now. Get down. I won't forgive you. I won't beg mercy from mean and greedy ones like you. I swear I'll eat your liver and drink the blood out of you. Wait, we are here to get her. We are just retreating for later. Wait a minute. I warned you not to interrupt me. Come on, Can't you fly down there? Let's try. Minhee Minhee - Am I dying? - I'm sorry, Minhee. I don't have to be a fortune teller anymore. That was some flying. Mnhee, Minhee, Minhee, Hyuk, Don't do this. Don't avoid me. I'm okay. Actually I feel better now. I know you are sympathetic but, don't be. I never loved you even once. Don't lie to me anymore. The important thing is that we can stay together. If I really loved you I would've set you free a long time ago. Like I said, I didn't love you at all. Not even once? Not even once. So you took advantage of me from the start. I think you still need me. Answer me. Do you still need me? You said that's why you were with me. Hyuk, please. Take out the marble. I'll give you what you need. Don't do this, please. Then give yourself to me. Harah
