During the Japanese colonial rule, Japan banned Korean language education to eradicate Korea's national spirit The Korean Society decided to make a dictionary to preserve Korean when it was stopped after Joo Si-gyeong's death 1933, NORTHERN MANCHURIA That way! Get him! I was in a rush to leave Korea after the independence protest. This is all I could bring. It's Sir Joo Si-gyeong's drafts you were looking for. Thank you, sir. There he is! Japan stole our country. Now, they're taking away our national spirit. They'll soon stop the use of Korean in all the schools. They'll keep a close watch on you. My bag! Still, someone must do this, sir. Scatter out and find him! Yes, sir! KOREAN LANGUAGE BY JOO SI-GYEONG I'll complete the 'Mal-mo-e' with the others.

Why are you calling me bro? - Pan-su. - Yes? - You're fired. - What? Think I don't know things are going missing here? Why you! Stop bringing rats into the theater! It wasn't me! I don't know him!

You can't read it anyway! You caused trouble in school, didn't you! - Can you read this? - What? I can't read or write. Read it, please? You smell like beer. Oh, really? Pay school fees up to March 30th or be expelled. What? What does that mean? He'll be forced to leave school if you don't pay. Damn Japanese rats! They'll kick him out over a few bucks? Damn bastards! I'll take it. Dad! Tell them I'll pay by next week. I'll get work and pay. You always say that! Lee Gwang-su and Yun Chi-ho are now working at the Korea-Japan Alliance, sir. Their team members have all disbanded and dispersed. I knew they wouldn't last. How dare they seek independence! For the Japanese empire to rule Korea forever, we must root out the Korean spirit! Understood? By the Emperor's command, I'll make Korea one with Japan, sir! HAEJU, HWANGHAE PROVINCE - Welcome. - Thank you. Hwanghae dialect words, as you requested. Thank you. What will you teachers do now? We're going to Manchuria. We hoped to teach Korean kids our language and history, but the Japanese are onto us even out here. What about you? The Korean Language Society is the only ethnic group left... Please don't worry about us. Please travel safely to Manchuria. Be safe and take care. See? There! We lost him! What's up with you? I can't do it. You said it was for Deok-jin's school fees! I'm busy, too, you know. Okay, fine. Be careful, man! Don't advertise that you're pickpocketing! Sorry. Hey! That guy looks like he's got some money. - Who? - With the black bag. They all have black bags! The guy with gold glasses. Right! I see him. Let's go. Where's Bong-du? He's eating hotteok rice cakes? Bong-du! What? Now? What? Are you okay? Wait! Breathe! What's wrong? Are you okay? Help! Poor young man... Wake up, mister! Dang! I almost died. Thought I was dead. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Bless your heart. I almost choked on the rice cake. Make it softer, ma'am! Wait! My bag! Wait! Stop! Choon-sam! Choon-sam! I'm right here! I told you to wait here! - I did! - Run! Shoot! Wrong way! Stop! Come back! Move! Give me my bag! Let go! Give it back! - What? - Why take my pillow? Where's my bag? You ran off with it! Are you crazy? Why would I do that? I can't sleep without that pillow! What? You two are a team, aren't you? Let go of me. Don't grab me by the collar! Okay, fine. Who do you mean? That guy? Come back here! Let go! Give me that. - My bag first! - Give it back! Where's my bag? Give me my bag! You! What are you doing? Darn it! Stop! Freeze! There! He went that way! Aren't you paying? I'm sorry. Here! ♪ Strike gold, buy an ox ♪ ♪ Strike gold, buy some ale ♪ Hey! Choon-sam! So what's inside the bag? Stop it. Anything good inside? Why's he here? Stupid! Why did you drop this? You found your bag? Bong-du? You stole it? I warned you not to touch other people's things! - Bro! - I'm glad you found it. Mister? Wait... I'm not one to ask for favors. But could you lend me 50 cents? How about 30? What? You must have a reason to run from the cops. I'll keep quiet for you. Or let's go to the cops now. Dad! Hi. Are you going to prison again? No! Why would I go there? Aren't you leaving? What did my dad do wrong this time? Forget it! It's nothing. You're the director of Seoul Middle School? Yes, sir. Teaching Korean students to become loyal Japanese citizens... You have an important duty. All by the grace of the Emperor! Then why is your name still Ryu Wan-taek? Forgive me, sir! Koreans have been ordered to change their names! The son of the director of the best school in Seoul... Why's he the head of the Korean Language Society? It's just a small bookstore, sir. What? You work for Japan's great empire! How can you say that? BOOKSTORE KOREAN LANGUAGE SOCIETY What a relief... If you got caught, the teachers could've been harmed. I know... But what if that man goes to the police? I doubt it. What good would that do him? Damn rotten fool. "Gonchida". "Mekjagu", "hogamjae", "dangchu"... They're all in Hwanghae-do dialect. How would he know? His name's Kim Pan-su. He's been in and out of prison often. Who? Dad! A guest is here. - Soon-hee... - Daddy. Someone's here. Hey, Grisly! Some nerve! I don't believe this. Old-Timer! You're still alive? How've you been, Grisly? I missed you! Sponsorship is down. Magazine sales plummeted, too. Hardly any customers come to the bookstore, either. Mr. Lim? You're still not finished with the definitions? I'm on the last letter of the alphabet. To hold the forum as planned, we must hurry, sir. We were busy this week with the magazine and the store. We'll hire someone for errands. Please finish the definitions first. Okay. Stop drinking, sir. Okay. I quit drinking. You always say that. I came to see Old-Timer! I don't remember his name. - There's no one like that here. - I'll explain what he looks like. Go, please. He's got caterpillar eyebrows and smiles often! Grisly! You came? That's him! Why didn't you wait for me out here? Do you know him? He saved my life. It was no big deal. This is Old-Timer. Come in. - Where are you going? - Follow me. What is this place? Where are you taking me? We're here. This is it? Come on in. Hello. We must've been destined to meet! I hear you're the leader here. You should've told me Old-Timer worked with you. We need to hire someone to run errands. He lost his job at the theater and is looking for work. We need someone. Why hire someone like him? He's a pickpocket! He's got a long criminal record! He did it to pay for his son's school fees. And who doesn't have a criminal record here? He's different from us! Anyway, I won't have him join us. The prison guard came inside our room right then! So what did I do? I ate it. I swallowed it whole. - The entire petition? - Really? They can't cut my stomach or look through my poo! He got beaten many times in prison because of me. I saved that old man's life many times. I can't have my cellmate leave as a corpse. That's enough. Please go. We're not hiring. Mister? Let bygones be bygones, huh? I heard you were gathering words for something. I'm the best at that. I talked up a storm in prison. You know the sign man at Korea Theater? Advertising movies? Arirang of tears! Arirang of laughs! Arirang of... Please leave now! Didn't you hear me? Come on. Hello. I'm Lim Dong-ik, a poet. Welcome aboard. Mr. Lim! We need to hire someone anyway. - He's great with words! - Thank you. - I'm Kim Pan-su. - Mr. Ryu? He saved our dear Mr. Cho's life. I'm sorry about earlier. I'm Koo Ja-young. It's okay, ma'am. Her husband's in Hamheung Prison. Poor man. It's freezing there. But it's better than Seodaemun. They beat people there a lot. It's much better. What? Mr. Min's wife is in Seodaemun Prison. Oh no... I'm Min Woo-chul. Welcome, sir. Thank you. He's Ryu Jung-hwan. We met. He's been to my house, too. Some personality... I'm reporter Park Hoon. Hi. You can't tell anyone what goes on in here. If you say so, I won't say a word! - When a youngster doesn't listen? - Yes. - Then you "huryeochida" (pound)! - I see. Don't just hit him. Pound him! Then he'll listen. - Swing down. - Right. Like this! Could you explain "hwigargida" (clout)? - A clout? - Yes. This is pounding. Clout? How can I explain? How's this? Like this. From the side? Can you elaborate? I guess he needed a good beating. Ms. Koo? - We have a meeting. - Right. Can you explain more? - Ms. Koo! - Coming! Please... Why would you ask him? I think it helps. He has a point. I'll ask again later, sir. Pound! Clout! Why ask me? I should pound him! Let's finish off definitions and collect all dialects. From the dialects, we... Did you ask him to fix something? Me? No. I did. To decide on standard words, a forum... Please! Can't you do that later? I'm sorry! Next year, we'll hold a forum to decide on... standard words. Let's finish dialects within 2... I mean the dictionary! Hold on. Can't you do that later? We're in a meeting! I'm sorry. I'm almost done. There! All done nice and strong! Please put these in alphabetical order. I'm supposed to clean or run errands. Darn it! Put these in what? These are Korean language teachers in Seoul from different regions. Let's meet and explain to them why we need to record dialects. - We need their help. - Well done. Many of these Korean teachers will already be monitored. They don't have to be language teachers. Let's find anyone who uses dialects. Right. We don't have much time. Let's find anyone we can. I'll start with these teachers. - Good luck. - Bye. - Is it over? - Yes. What did you do? Why scribble on the word list? I was bored. I just drew on the back. It looks like him. Give it back! Mr. Ryu! Pretty good! I'm sorry. How could you draw on the word list? I just got a little bored. You weren't very specific, so I just did what I could. You don't know the alphabet? Who doesn't know the alphabet? Do you know how to read? Read this. Is something wrong? We need to talk. Why you! This is too hard for such little pay! You know he's illiterate, don't you? Sir! We're making a dictionary. He can't work if he can't read. Then he can learn. Right? I can hear everything. Darn it. No stealing, fighting, being late, or idling. You understand? Shit. That's a long list of things I can't do! No cursing, either! And no Japanese! Words reflect the spirit. No cursing or Japanese here! Ever! You have a month. Learn to read and write. If you break any of this, you'll leave here. Understood? How can I learn to read and write in just a month? I haven't known my whole life! Fine. I'll do it. I've got it! Great! You teach him to read. - No! - No way! He wasn't like this before. Many comrades got arrested. Korean classes were made illegal and many got arrested 3 years ago. - This place burst asunder. - A sun what? "Asunder", sir. He took on the role as leader and changed. He used to laugh and kid around before. Then he should quit as leader, and stop judging people. That's dirty. Please don't do that. - Sorry. - He's strict, isn't he? No, that's just plain rude. - First letter? - Giyuk. That's good. - Nieun. - Good. - Digeut. - Digeul. Digeut! That's good. Are you drunk? I had a couple of drinks. The poet said if he doesn't drink, he can't get... - Ideas? I see. - Right! Still, you can't drink during work hours. I gave you a list of things not to do on the job. - Mr. Ryu! - Madam! Howdy doody, you all! How've you been? Here you go. After quittin' teaching, ain't much to do. That's Jeju Island dialect. Gotta make a living, right? I started a small pub. - Too busy for anythin'. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi! How's everything? - Good. Wait... I'm going home. It's 5 o'clock. - Bro! - What's with you? - Well... - What's this? I need to buy pills for my brother. I can't steal forever. I passed the rickshaw test. They have tests for that? Why? Want to drive one, too? Dang! I wish I could! He's studying these days. You? Studying what? To run errands, the bookstore is teaching him to read and write. They're not errands. I practically run the place! Know what they do there? - What? - Listen. (Jeju Island dialect) Know what that means? Sounds like Chinese. No! It's how they speak in Jeju Island. - Really? - Yeah! He acts so smart, I wondered what he's up to. He meets country folks for words like grandmother, grandma, granny... Then he records them. For what? - How would I know? - Have a drink. I missed this. I feel like I can breathe now. Drink up! Thank you. Bye. Take care. How may I help you? Where's Ryu Jung-hwan? I don't know. KOREAN ALPHABET I haven't seen him in a while. Do you want to die? Speak in Japanese! Where's Ryu Jung-hwan now? I really don't know, sir. I'm just an employee here. Tell him when he comes. If he doesn't want to close the store, come to me at the Government General by tomorrow. Understood? Are you all right? Sure. I'm used to it. Damn bastards pulled my hair! Oh no! I'm late! What time is it? I said you can't be late! Hurry up. Say we're sorry. We won't be late again. We're sorry. We won't be late again. He's not scary. Let's go in. The others are all late, too. Why pick on me? What? Is something down there? Mr. Kim? Can you help me? Sure. - Who's this? - My youngest. My neighbor couldn't watch her today. But you can't bring her here... - How old are you? - I'm 7 years old. What's your name? I'm Kim Soon-hee. - Soon-hee! - Hi, Soon-hee! Such a pretty girl! Have you eaten? You look hungry. Good thing you don't resemble your dad! Go say, "Hotteok, please". Hotteok, please. How can he say no? Cops from the Government General came last night. For what? Looking for Mr. Ryu. We're moving... everything to here just in case. - Put this where? - Here. What is all this stuff? - They're words. - Words? It took us 10 years to get this many. 10 years? Why collect words, not money? What good is all this? To make a dictionary, of course! - They say lunch is "bento" now. - Right. We're losing Korean words to Japanese ones. Who cares? What's wrong with calling it "bento"? It's not right! - Give me that, please. - Sure. Words contain the nation's spirit. We say "our country" and "our family". But they don't use "our" like us in the West. They say "my country" and "my family". That shows our care for each other and our community spirit. The words show what? Community spirit. Community spirit? I had no idea. Who'd think all this would be down here? "It went to the kitchen and looked in the furnace." "A chestnut suddenly dropped right on the tiger's eye!" "While the tiger couldn't see and stumbled," "the turtle bit the tiger's paw!" Eat it. Do you know why hotteok is called that? Why, mister? Hot! Hot! It's hot! Then what? You have to blow "ho", like this. That's why it's called hotteok. But it's not hot. It's not? Then it's just like other rice cakes. Can I have a bite? It's yummy! Dad... Soon-hee? That's not why. I'll tell you. Do you know what "intruder" means? Like Japan, other countries' armies that came here are called intruders. The Chinese character for intruder is "ho". The Chinese Qing army came here 60 years ago. It was the rice cake of the Chinese people. So it was called hotteok. Like a kid will understand... Say, intruder "ho". - Intruder "ho". - That's good. Eat it. Mr. Ryu? Someone's here. Who? Wow! Who's Mr. Ryu's dad to have an aide like him? He's the director of Seoul Middle School. Seoul Middle School? You know Mr. Ryu hates it. Stop. - Go home early with Soon-hee. - Sure. You've worked hard for a month. A month felt like a year! We should go now, sir. I'll go on my own. Mr. Ryu! You're going to Seoul Middle School? I need to go, too. Can we ride with you? Please? - But... - Let's go. - Get in. - What are you doing? It's our Soon-hee's first time in a kuruma... - I mean, a car? - Yes! Right! I guess I do say, "our Soon-hee" a lot. It means that our community spirit is shown through our words, right? What? I'm not slacking on the job. Mr. Cho said I could leave early. Mrs. Koo said we'll study tomorrow. You're studying? Me, too! What are you studying? The Japanese alphabet! Hiragana... Right. Time for a nap. But I'm not sleepy. Where did you learn that song? From my older brother. If I go to school not knowing it, they'll call me stupid. Na, ni, nu, ne, no... How about a tiger story? A tiger caught 3 rabbits. The end... Lean on me and sleep. Good girl. Nice school! Soon-hee! There's your brother. Deok-jin! Right. He can't hear me. Call him. Deok-jin! Dad? Is school over? - What? - Hello, sir. - Hi. He's your friend? - Yes. Good. See you tomorrow. Bye, Soon-hee. Say goodbye to him. We could've walked. Thanks. - Let's go. - Where? You'll see. I sent the car for you ages ago. Why are you so late? Our guest has been waiting! You're a hard man to meet. I asked Director Yanagawa to send for you. Sit down now! I heard the Korean Language Society is making a Korean dictionary. A Korean dictionary? I heard it's been stopped since Mr. Joo Si-gyeong passed away. I see. If the head of the Korean Language Society changes his name, it'll set the Koreans a good example. Yanagawa? A Korean dictionary? How dare you! Don't call me like this again. Here. Handsome boy! He looks just like you. Really? Like father, like son. But he's got bad eyes. I keep telling him not to study so hard. But he reads non-stop. That's great! One night, I woke up to pee, and he was gone. - So I looked for him. - Where was he? He was out on the porch, reading a book by the moonlight. When did I do that? You did! Why would I lie? Of course. Why would he lie? You must be so proud. Proud of him? Yes! I'd love a son like him. You're good! How much? It's a little expensive. - Can't be that much. - Dad? You don't have money. - It's right here. - Of course! This is money, isn't it? I'll pay your school fees, too. - Pay the school! - Dad? What about me? Of course Daddy will buy anything our Soon-hee wants! What a great father! "As we've changed names and become great citizens of Japan, let's take part in the Greater East Asia War. Be determined to win this war. At the Korea Theater, the Korea-Japan Alliance of Writers... Writers? What? Sir! That means they taught Koreans Japanese to use as cannon fodder! But Korean writers are encouraging that? Why yell at him? He didn't write that. Where are you going? Going home? I'm leaving early. Take care! He'll probably go and drink. It must hurt that his co-writers now work for Japan. Forget the dictionary, what if we can't make magazines? We'll lose even more sponsors now. We must save costs for printing the dictionaries later. Let's worry about collecting all the words first. How's this month's magazine coming along? - The editing is done. - Good. Then I'll take the final copy to the print shop. - Great. - No, I'll go. It's okay. I'll go. No, I can do it. I just have to deliver it. I should do errands like that. I'll do it. What reeks like dung? You call yourselves writers? Can you see if I've memorized this right? Okay... First one is giyuk. Then it's nieun. Then digeut. Next is rieul. What's next? Mieum? Then bieup? Next is... - Siot. - Right! Siot! Stupid! It's hard to learn in my old age. What's that? Wait! Stop! KOREA-JAPAN ALLIANCE OF WRITERS LECTURE ON CURRENT AFFAIRS Crazy old man! Don't throw dung here! How dare you! Lee Gwang-su! Joo Yo-han! - Shut up! - How could you! You call yourselves poets? Why you! You son of a bitch! I told you, sir. We should've known when he said he'd go the print shop. Don't say that. Grisly isn't a bad man. Something must have happened. Sir? Like what? Isn't it obvious? He got paid, then ran off with the print money! Forget it. Hello? Anyone here? He's so heavy. The dung reeks! Finally... It must be here somewhere. What are you doing? You scared me! Mr. Ryu, I didn't make it to the print shop. On the way, I... How low can you go? What's up with you? - How dare you! - What? Why? What are you doing? You'll steal the membership money, too? What? Get out now! I was looking for the first-aid kit. Look, Ryu Jung-hwan! Seeing someone like this, you should ask what happened. That depends on who. You got drunk, fought, and came to steal more, didn't you? It's because of folks like you, Korea is still under Japan! Because of damn money! Because of people who sell our country for money like you! Why you! You'll hit me? Try it! That's all people like you know how to do! Don't judge poor folks like that. Damn it! Here you go! Have a good life! Where am I? Our leader, Mr. Ryu! Ah... I can explain. Drinking is forbidden until we finish the dictionary. I'll go bring Mr. Kim. It's my fault. No need. Grisly won't come back. He may laugh things off, but he's a man of pride. He'll feel insulted and won't come back. Bro! What are you doing? Why are you so late? Been fighting again? Let me see. You're hurt badly. They want you back at the theater. Come back, bro. Some crazy old man came by. He threw dung all over the theater. So the security guard got fired. The owner got so mad. Anyway, they want you back. Came all this way to hurt me with words again? This month's magazine is out. I thought you'd like it. Are you kidding me? You know I can't read. Think that's funny? Sir? I was wrong. Why do such a thing? Yelling, "how low can you go"! Whatever. Just go! Daddy? What's funny? Go on! Mr. Kim? Do you know they're called dandelions? It's from "dent de lion" and means a lion's tooth. They're strong flowers. My dad told me that. Rather than 10 steps of a man, 10 people's 1 step together is greater. So he taught people to read. He said it'd spread like the dandelion's seeds. Then we can change the world and eventually gain independence. But my father changed and became pro-Japanese. I hated it. I felt so ashamed. So I left to study in Manchuria. There was nothing I could do then. After 5 years there, - on my way home, - Gil-nam! Stop! I bumped into a boy at Seoul Station. I'm sorry. Gil-nam? A Korean should speak in Korean. I can't speak Korean. Let's go! Rock, paper, scissors! That's when I decided to make a dictionary. Where people gather, there are words. Where words come together, the will can be formed. And with the will shared, we'll find a way for independence. When I convinced my friends like that... I was foolish. I should've had more respect. Please forgive me. What the...? - Why you! - Why? He left? That's my name. What's this? "Friend". "To my friend, Kim Pan-su". Friend? That's a laugh. What friend? Oh, no! These, too. - We should've fixed the roof. - Yes. It's all wet. What? Who's on the roof? Who are you? Excuse me? This place can't run without me! Grisly! Mr. Kim! Missed me, huh? School. SCOOL First one, wrong. - Wrong, wrong... - What? - Wrong, wrong... - Why's this wrong? - I spelled this right! - No, it's wrong. Mr. Ryu? Why are they the same? 'School'! Well, it should be. But why? Finish marking! Hurry! SCHOOL Sleeping? Deok-jin? Son? "You don't know the alphabet?" "Words reflect the spirit!" "Sundae... Sundae soup" "Tofu... Tofu pancake!" - You hungry? - Got money? "On the tab." Why you! What? You can read that? "Hanbok"! What's this? "Sagwa Tangja"? That's not a word! "Satang Gwaja"! Cookies! "Yanghwa..." Take that! "Stupid"! What? Let's see. "A coy look..." "Why... can't you eat?" That's sad! "Today was... supposed to be my lucky day." Jeez! You stayed here all night? Yes. I lost track of time. - Did you cry? - Of course not! Why? Pity the main character? Just reminded me of my late wife. How did it go? He said he'd think about it. How long? It doesn't matter. He won't do it. Won't do what? We found a Korean language teacher who's originally from Sinuiju. I asked him for help with the Sinuiju dialect. He looked at me as if I were the Grim Reaper. Why? What's wrong with Koreans wanting to make a Korean dictionary? Forget him! He can't be the only one from there. Hold on. I've got to go check on the kids for a bit. - Sure. - I'll be back soon. - See you. - Bye. How long will it take? 4-5 years just collecting all the different dialects. In Gyeongsang-do alone, the dialects of Ulsan, Masan, and Busan are different. Not many are willing to help. They think it's dangerous. Can't we leave out dialects? No! They're part of our language and heritage. Everyone! Come out! - What is it? - Look. What's going on? Greet them. This is the Korean Language Society. These are my brothers from prison! Introduce yourselves. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - Choon-sam! - Yes, bro. I'm Jang Choon-sam from Gwangju. Leave out your names. I'm from Uiseong. - Buyeo. - Pyongyang. - Haesan. - Jeju Island. Gosung. - Gangneung. - Onyang. Andong. Mokpo. Busan. I'm from Seoul. They told me to stay out. You can help, too! Wonderful! Soon-hee? 'GAWI' (SCISSORS) You illiterate fools! Can't you read? It says 'Gawi'! Quiet! Start from Choon-sam. - Gaseh. - Gangye. - Gawoo. - Gasige. - Gaseh. - Kasige. - Gaseh. - Gawoo. - Gaseh. - Goseh. - Gasey. - Garoo. Gaseh. Gawi! Next. Hold it up like this. 'Gochujang' (chilli paste). - Kochujang. - Kangchujang. - Gochujang! - Kojang. - Tangchujang. - Koyijang. Kochijang. - Kochujang. - Dangaijang. Kochijang. Gochujang. How did you think of this? Rather than a man's 10 steps, 14 men's 1 stop is better, right? Have some 'hotteok'. Thank you! Thank you! - Why you! - Bong-du! Sir! They're shutting us down. "As of June 10th," "all newspapers in Korean will cease to be published." "Except for magazines published by" "Korea-Japan Alliance affiliates," "everything in Korean will be discontinued." "Likewise, all Korean bookstores..." We must hold the forum for standard words before then. What forum? For what? Different districts say 'gochujang' differently. It's to decide the standard word. Why? Just say we'll go with 'gochujang'. We can't decide that ourselves. People across the country must agree for it to be standard. That's a lot of work. Then do it within this month. We need to gather all the dialects before holding the forum. When will we get all those? So much to fill... Who's here? I heard a crazy man threw dung at the Korea Theater. Know who it was? I have no idea. Your wife is in Seodaemun Prison. When was the last time you got a letter from her? I heard she's badly hurt. Come if you change your mind. By the way, I already know it was Lim Dong-ik. Don't sweat it. "In the blue sky," "on a small, white boat" In the blue sky... Right, Deok-jin? He used to sing it for me. Right. That's the song. Dad? Please stop talking in Korean with Soon-hee. Why can't I speak Korean? She's going to school next year. She'll get hit if she speaks it. Why don't you learn Japanese instead? Kim Soon-hee. It's late. Go to bed. Man... Bro! Hi! Hello, sir. - Don't call me, sir. - Right. Busy inside? All the movies are in Japanese these days. It's weird seeing actors acting in Japanese. The boss blames me for no one coming, but it's not my fault! This is why it's empty! Who'd look at a signboard with soldiers on it? They come to watch based on the signboard. Wait! What? Did he speak Japanese again? - Did you? - No, I didn't. Signboard! What? Signboard! We found it! A way to gather all the dialects in a short time! Let's put an ad in our last magazine. This goes all over the country. Someone from the south reads it... they can send us their dialect words. And so on to collect all the dialects! - Let's make the... - "Mal-mo-e"! How about it? Mr. Ryu. The Government General will not be happy about it. But there's no other way, sir. Are you sure about this? You'll have to take the blame. It's okay. I can take it. That's why they made me the head. - I agree. - Great. We should try everything we can! Right! Let's do it. Let's make our last magazine right! Yes! Let's do it! SEND US WORDS FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS! Mail for the bookstore... Here. What? That's it? Why? Expecting more? Yes, way more! But that's it. At least we got one. Thank you. Please bring us more mail as soon as it comes? Just one? Damn... Where's it from? In-ok. She's your wife, right? It came from prison. Then we didn't get any? I guess not. She's strong. I'm sure she'll be fine. How could no one help? Even unschooled folks like us are helping out. We sold 3 times more magazines than last month. Why aren't we getting any responses? Don't worry. They'll come. Cheers. Of course, I'm worried. Mal-mo-e of laughs! Mal-mo-e of tears! Mal-mo-e of fun! Come one and all! Coming soon! It's awkward. It'll work out. I've never seen you like this. Were you bored? Did you teach him that? I told you that's not it. He can never get it right. Learn from the pro! Mal-mo-e of tears! Mal-mo-e of laughs! Mal-mo-e of fun! Come one and all! Coming soon! That's my bro! - That's it! - It's got to have soul! Spring is here Even in her heart On her way to pick some herbs - Not there. - Wait! The spring breeze blows to the Arirang... Where is everyone? Woo-chul said he was sick I told him to go and rest. He's distraught about In-ok's letter. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ryu went out with Bong-du and Choon-sam. They went drinking. - What? - Mr. Ryu lost his appetite. They went drinking without me? Eat food, sir. Right! I quit drinking. It's the police! May I help you? Where is it? What do you mean? The copy of the dictionary you're making! What copy? We would've asked for permission to print if we had one. We're just getting started. There's no copy! What's wrong with writing a book in our language? - Sir! - Mr. Cho! Go on! Move it! No! You fools! Let go! Bastards! No! Stop! Oh, no! Where's Mr. Cho? Yes, sir. Thank you! I'm the head of the Korean Language Society! Release Mr. Cho! I put in the ad to collect words for "Mal-mo-e"! Why didn't you listen to me? You're the one who taught me Korean! Rather than 10 steps of a man, 10 people's 1 step together is greater! If Koreans learned and came together, you said we could gain independence! I thought Korea could gain independence. But I was foolish. - Dad! - It's been 30 years! If it were going to happen, it would've happened by now. Don't be foolish. You think Korea can be liberated? When will that be? Next year? The year after? 10 years or 30 years later? Will you live like that till then? Yes! I will! We must preserve our language! You're out of your mind! To save your life, I said you'd join. KOREA-JAPAN ALLIANCE APPLICATION What? You want me to go pro-Japanese like you to save just myself? This is an act of patriotism! Korea is lost as a country! Kyoda Mankichi! Yes, sir! Kanemura Koseuke! Yes, sir! Iwasato Masao! Yes, sir! Hochyu Shigeo! Yes, sir! They are proud young soldiers who will fight as citizens of Japan for peace in Greater East Asia! - Mr. Kim? - Stop! You were here then. Ueda knew it was here. He knew everything. You think I squealed? We know you didn't. - Hold on. - I'm not suspecting you. I mean the gang you brought. I asked them, and they came to help us! Mr. Kim. Any one of them could've betrayed us. What are you doing? Damn it. Stop it. Why should I? Do you know why Mr. Cho was taken? It was your father. He paid them $30 to take Mr. Cho instead of you. It's been 10 years. We worked hard for 10 years to make a dictionary! They said they'll burn the collection after Mr. Cho's trial! What do you mean they'll burn it? Think they'll return it to us? It's all over. SEODAEMUN PRISON KIM IN-OK DECEASED We received orders not to notify you of her death. She's been buried. They promised to let her go. Where's my wife In-ok? Please go. No... Where's In-ok? Tell me where she is! Where's our In-ok? Our In-ok! They promised to release her! Soon-hee? Still awake, sweetie? Wake him and have some hotteok. Have some hotteok. Do you know why it's called 'hotteok'? You don't know intruder "ho", do you? Stupid. Who said you could talk like that? Deok-jin says that all the time. Quiet! Go to bed! Deok-jin? Don't you want some hotteok? You work at the Korean Language Society? If they catch you working there, you'll go to prison again. I'll be dragged off to war. Then what about Soon-hee? Dad... I'm so scared. Mr. Kim! What is it? Mr. Cho's been released! Woo-chul! Why aren't you going in? Let's go in. Woo-chul... Why are you hurt like that? Sir... I'm sorry. It was me. They said they'd take the words and nothing else. They said they'd save our In-ok... Woo-chul! How could you? Woo-chul... Woo-chul... It must have troubled you... Why didn't you come with In-ok? Please keep helping Mr. Ryu... Dear... You can rest now. - No! - Sir? Mr. Cho... Sir! You can't go like this! When will you take it? It's just like him. You didn't know? What do you mean, ma'am? There is another set of copies. He said you can never be too safe and wrote copies all night. They're hidden in the crocks. Take them when you can. Let's make the dictionary. What? Mr. Cho left us a copy. What do you mean? He copied over 160,000 words at home every night. We just need to hold the forum for dialects. We can't give up. Let's continue gathering the dialects. We can't even hold funerals now. How can we collect dialects and hold a forum? KOREA-JAPAN ALLIANCE APPLICATION Mr. Cho would be furious! What about our friends in prison? How else can we do it? We must complete the dictionary! Ryu Jung-hwan! Come to your senses! If you do this, you'll become like your dad! Mr. Park! An alliance with Japan? I'd be too sorry to Mr. Cho to ever do that! Who is it? What brings you here? SEOUL STATION STORAGE ZONE This is our storehouse. This way. This is all for the Korean Language Society. What? - They were all sent to us? - Yes. We were ordered to send all mail for you to the Government General. We sent around 100 daily, then kept the rest here. "We're students from Sinuiju." "We read the magazine" "and send some words unique to here." "Also, we hope this small pledge can be of use." We thought long and hard. We couldn't just give them to the Japanese. Thank you very much. It must be dangerous... It's okay. We're Koreans, too. Wait. Mr. Ryu? I have something to say. I heard... some Seoul Middle School students were drafted. I was going to suggest stop working to keep your son safe. I see. Then what about you? Thank you for all your help, sir. I'm sorry I can't help now. I want to help. It's okay. I'm sorry, Mr. Ryu. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'll be going, then. KOREA-JAPAN ALLIANCE KOREAN LANGUAGE SOCIETY Wow! A dandelion! Pretty good!

Unlike me, I wanted you to be a great man. That's why I named you that. - Understand? - Yes. When did she fall asleep? Oh no! I'm so sorry! Daddy? You're awake, sweetie? Soon-hee's name...

Weeds must be rooted out, so they'll never grow again. Yes, sir! APPLICATION FOR CHURCH MEETING APPROVED SEOUL HWADONG CHURCH Korean classes are gone from schools. Korean Language Society's magazine has also been discontinued. What's the reason? It's because our country is weak. For our Korea to be strong again, we can't keep hating Japan. We must follow the great Japanese empire. What's he saying? We must research their strengths and learn from them! Crazy! What do you mean? For true happiness, we must truly become Japanese. That's enough! You traitor! You called us here for this? We must follow the great Japanese empire! Are you insane? Get down from there! He must be up to something. Keep watching him. Yes, sir.

You'll know when you go. - Has it started? - Yes. You can go in. You're teachers, right? When the movie ends, stay in your seats. Go in. Please stay seated. Hello. You're teachers, right? Stay seated after the movie, please. Done for the day! - Bye, sir. - Close up! Follow me. Hurry! Not just Mr. Ryu, but all you teachers could've been arrested! He had us fooled! I had no idea and swore at him! I would've done that, too! The forum at church before was fake! This is the real deal! Coming soon! Here comes the real Mr. Ryu! Brothers and sisters! We came here to preserve our spoken and written language. Words reflect a nation's spirit. Books are our lifelines! Let's make a Korean dictionary together! Then we've agreed to 'Guduswei' as the standard word for 'miser'. Next is 'goongdoongyi' and 'goongdengyi'. How can we finish in a week like this? Let's hurry! But still! We can't just rush through it! Once published, books last forever. We must make it properly. Let's move along. 'Goongdengyi' and 'goongdoongyi' were used the most. Other words included 'goongdi', 'bangdengyi', and 'bangti'. We call it 'eungdi'. We don't call it 'goongdi' or 'bangdi' much. But we call it 'eungdengyi'! In Hwanghaedo, we call that 'eongdengyi'. I see. 'Eungdi, eongdi, and eongdengyi' are different from 'goongdoongyi'. Don't they all mean the same? The hips? 'Eongdengyi' (buttocks)... are the two round fleshy parts that form the lower area of the waist. 'Goondengyi' (hips) is a projection of the pelvis and upper thighs with muscles. What do you mean? It is on the human quadrupeds... Mr. Ryu? Sorry. May I? Can you sit here and rub? Rub against the chair. Get up and turn around! There! See? Below the waist? Round, fleshy area? Here. That's 'eongdungyi'. And here? The part below in white. Right here! That's 'goongdengyi', right? Exactly! - That's easy! - Great! How's Ryu Jung-hwan? He hasn't come out much since the forum, sir.

We looked everywhere, but they're gone. KOREAN LANGUAGE SOCIETY Bro! Mr. Ryu! We found them! We found the final copies! We found them! They were in that corner. We didn't know. We just piled things on top. Is it what you're looking for? Yes... 1947 Mister! It's you! I'm Kim Soon-hee. GRAND DICTIONARY OF KOREAN TO MY FRIEND KIM PAN-SU Our daddy... He must be happy. "Dear Deok-jin," "I always felt sorry to you kids." The fact that I am your dad, I'm so sorry about that. It would've been so much better if you had a different father. But, Deok-jin, I'm still not sure what this "Mal-mo-e" really is, but when it's finally made, to you and Soon-hee, I think I'll feel a little less sorry. So I suggested holding the forum. Choon-sam is snoring again. I should wake him. - Mr. Kim! - Mr. Kim! Are you crying? A dandelion! It's a dandelion, right? You're right. Mister! Pass!
