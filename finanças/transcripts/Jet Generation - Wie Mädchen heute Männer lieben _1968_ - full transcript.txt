Königinstraße. American Consulate. Daddy didn't want me to go. But nevertheless, I flew over. I know he's longing to see Dirk again before he dies. Your file is pretty thin, don't you think? To be perfectly honest, we've no idea where your brother is at present. Though I'm quite certain this little matter will soon be cleared up. If I thought that this little matter, as you put it, would soon be cleared up I would never have left New York. We haven't heard a single word from Dirk in four months. Perhaps he's fallen in love then. But of course! And because of that he hasn't drawn on his account in four months. He sold his apartment and got a hundred thousand marks for it. When he spent all his money you'll see, he'll remember his account. There's no reason for you to worry yourself about it at all. Are you trying to tell me you've done nothing about it? Nothing at all? We notified the German police department of your brother's disappearance. That's all? You're very attached to your brother? I want to know where he is. However, seems that I came to the wrong address. Just a moment. Miss Franz, will you please contact the police department. Mister Arnold. Perhaps if you're lonely sometime... That I should think is most unlikely. - Not even for lunch? - Not even for lunch. It's only Dirk I'm looking for in Munich, Mister Hyman. Hyman. Have you anything new on Dirk Buchheim? His sister from New York is here with me. She like to see you. Okay. He'll see you 2 o'clock at this address. And now, how about that lunch? - Then it's true what they say. - What do you mean? You've got to have the right connections, nothing else to learn a job like this. Enjoy yourself? Hasn't Mister Arnold arrived yet? Inspector Arnold. Well, why don't you go tell inspector Arnold that I'm waiting. I do have an appointment. Miss Buchheim from New York is here. She has an appointment. Right you are. If you please. You could have saved yourself a trip. I cannot produce your brother from nowhere. Every year, we have thousands of such cases. - If this could be called a case. - Just what are you trying to say? An investigation of each case... Out of the question. Or must I be more explicit? But surely, Dirk has studied here for two years. Has he? According to our files, he was not registered at any of the colleges or the University in this town. That should please my father. The apartment that Dirk owned in Munich was sold all of a sudden. Were you aware of this? No. It's four months since he's drawn in his account. That's right. And what's your conclusion? That's for you to decide! The reason that I came was to find out exactly what you're doing about it! Not a single person came forward with any information, in spite of your reward. There's bound to be someone here in Munich whom Dirk knew, surely. Let me advise you. That won't be necessary, thanks. Would you tell me exactly what you've done? The only person who has seen your brother is obviously the man who sold the apartment for him. And what's the name of this man? Harald Steinhauf. He runs a second-hand car business in der Georgenstraße. You'll not have any more success than we had. You may even find it more difficult. Well, we'll see. - A fantastic car, real perfect. - It must be the clutch then. Excuse me, are you Harald Steinhauf? Yes. I am Carroll Buchheim. Four months ago, you sold an apartment for Dirk Buchheim, my brother. Yes. Since then Dirk has disappeared. Aha. Ah, was Dirk around at the time? What was that? Did you deal with my brother personally? - Yeah. - He was alone? Yeah. And after, were you in contact with him? Maybe you've seen him recently. Has he left you his address? Why not ask the police that? Are you sure he didn't say where he was going? He came to see me, that's all. How was he then? Can you remember what he was wearing? I'll try to come by this evening, okay? Yeah, okay. How did he look? How would he look? Two legs, two arms, a head. I'm Carroll Buchheim. I telephoned you. Oh yes, sure. Come on in. The police are already been snooping around. Are you sure you didn't know Dirk? No. Or anyone who might have known Dirk? Have any of his friends called since you moved in? I wouldn't know. You see, I'm an actor, I spend very little time in Munich. Has Dirk left any of his things in the apartment? Only a record. My brother's taste was always rather vulgar. Beethoven. You might as well have it. I'll be leaving tomorrow for a couple of months. The housekeeper will have the key. Thank you. Oh it's some time since I've seen him around. In any case, if he had friends or a girlfriend, I never saw them. He never brought them back to his apartment. There isn't much goes on in that house that I don't know about. Now I come to think of it at that time... he was pretty friendly. But another fellow who was there. Called Malsen. Raoul Malsen, I believe. He lived on the top floor. I used to clean his place for him. Some photographer. Great guy. Is he still living here? He moved out. A few months after the arrival of your brother. Ever seen Dirk and Malsen together again since then? Couldn't say. Thank you. Go in the back! Push it! Can I help? Are you Raoul Malsen? No. Have you got an appointment? No I haven't. In that case forget about it. You're not really the type he goes for. Who's not my type, Patty? I'll go crazy if this happens again! Every time we have these cymbals with suitcases. Why not send them luggage in advance. Now I'll have all that trouble with customs in Rome. What are we waiting for? Chris, what's she doing here? I don't know. Haven't asked her. Go and ask her, can't you? She wants to be a model no doubt. Now take this down, I'll be away for at least two nights. I should be back in Munich the day after tomorrow. Be sure to call up Miller in New York this evening. The number is in the Grey book. They can send the old frump over here. What's her name again? Rothmann! No, not her. The one that wears a wig. You mean Dorit. Yeah, her. She wants to talk. It's private. I've got no time just now. We've got to get away today. What's she after? She's looking for her brother. Tell her I'm not her brother. - She doesn't have to be told that. - Let's go! Go on, get in. What's your name? Carroll Buchheim. I've been told you lived in the same house as my brother. And that you and Dirk spent quite a lot of time together. Dirk Buchheim. Yeah, I knew him. What of it? Dirk is missing. Are you trying to drive with the brakes on? What do you mean, missing? He just disappeared after selling his apartment. When was that? About four months now. I wouldn't worry. Guess he's taking a vacation. Oh and remember to talk to that charlatan, personally. Tell him I'll fix up fashion in Munich only on the condition that I'm given a free hand. That clear? You've come over especially from New York? Can you remember when you last saw Dirk? The last time? Well... Well, give me a call when I get back to town. Or even better, I'll call you. Take the lady's number, Chris. You will have left by then, will you? I won't be leaving till I found my brother. I see. Have you any idea who Dirk's being around with recently? Tell you later. All right? Convince them to make some effort over the collection. I'm not wasting my time photographing dishcloths in front of the ruins of Munich. Some gimmick. That's my address. Here, you look after it. Do me a favor, snap out of it. Goodbye. Bye. Daddy? - How are you? - Carroll, I want you to come home. You won't find Dirk. I told you so. I've only had four days. I've got to speak to Raoul Malsen. I'm weak and it doesn't get any better. Now you're both gone. I will bring Dirk back with me. You must get well. Caroll, maybe there isn't much time. You mustn't talk like that. Bring Dirk home, please. I'll do that, Daddy. I want to see him again. Bye, Daddy. - Hello? - Carroll Buchheim. I'm afraid that... That Mister Malsen is not available at the moment? When would it be convenient to have a word with him? Well... Tomorrow, at four o'clock. At the Darling Boutique, Leopoldstraße. But if I were you I would stay clear. Thank you. New York? Besides other things you get well-paid for telling lies. You understand? What's eating you now? Have you forgotten how you got started? Meaning? One day real soon I'll be as big as you are. You've got my blessing. How about this? No. Is this enough? Try it on. - Can I help you? - I'll just look around. - Is there anything you like? - No. - How about this one here? - Garbage. Perhaps I didn't make it clear on the phone. I need something original. Fashion in Munich, if there's such a thing. Not London or Paris. So if you're to be included in the story think of something different. I can't use this trash. This doesn't fit back or front. Get change then. We'll get going. Okay. You were quite good once. Get rid of the cobwebs. What's happened to you? They're dreary. Crap. Hello there. Coincidence or betrayal? You were to call. - That so? - At least you said you were going to. Haven't I already told you everything? You've told me nothing yet. Ready. - I should have called her. - Then do it. - That's agreed then. - Bye. You coming? Couldn't we fix something definite right now? You seem to know what you want. Yes I'm pretty sure. Okay. Tomorrow then. I'll see you at the drugstore. Let's go. Don't forget now. Anything you fancy? - Yes, the black trouser suit there. - Fine. Did you know Dirk Buchheim? - And who is he? - A friend of Raoul's. Never seen him. 1.50. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Herald Tribune. It's one mark please. Thank you. It's too bad. No more lies please. If you still want so see Raoul Malsen, I'll help you. I'll take you. Let's go. Are you quite certain that you only want to see Raoul because of your brother? Quite certain! Don't you know Dirk? No, I've only known Raoul for three months. We met each other in London. Does he always treat you casually? Casually? We're friends. Get in, I'll take you to him. You're sacrificing yourself. Or you. Come on, Hella, give it to me. Here, take this, rack. Get out of the way, Hella. Julia, open the top button. Back a little. Back I said! Come on, move into position! Use the steps. Iris! Where the hell is Chris? Okay, strike it! We'll finish it at the studio. Come on, I'm hungry. Okay. - Where the hell have you been? - Finished already? - You want to get on with it? - Why not. That's just like you. And you're determined to get your interview. Are you ready to go? Keep quiet, will you. - I'm hungry! - You're overeat. So you want to talk business with me. Here, take the Targa. Come on. Looking for her brother, is she? She says he's disappeared. Raoul says he's on vacation. She's curious, wants to know if he's seen him recently. And he says? Up till now nothing. She's already in love with him. That's really comic. Where did you get your dress? Do you like it? I do. Guess. I don't know. From the boutique in which we've met. They're not bad but once in a while you have to wash their heads. To make clear who's in charge? And what do you do? I was a journalist in New York until the paper went bankrupt. - And? - Now I've got to decide. - Television or a small-town paper. - Pretty thing. What is it that you want to know about Dirk? We were friends for a few months. He's a complicated sort of guy. Contact difficulties. A couple of months after Dirk had come to live in the house I decided to move out. From that day on I've never seen him. Satisfied? And he's never called you since then? I want to pay. Haven't you any idea where he is? - You can keep the change. - Thank you. - Please call a cap. - Yes. I haven't seen him since that time. How should I know where he is or who he might have gone with? You ready? Hey, that's for me. Do you have any idea why Dirk sold his apartment? - For Malsen? - Yes, one moment please. You're quite a nice girl. Why not make things a little easier for yourself? I'll pick you up around nine o'clock. Private. Business is over from now on. Agreed? He isn't here. Come on. I thought that both of you had a pre-arranged agreement where he does as he wants? She they're going back to New York pretty soon. You must be pretty naive to believe that nonsense. You have no idea. Come on, stop it, Michael. - Do you have some new girls? - I need some myself. - You too? - What about her? - She's from New York. - New York? Ah! - We go to my place. - Where? - To my place. - Why? Well, because I have a curious nature. Are you afraid? Or should I carry you into it? Better not. Make some light. Sit down. This isn't in the telephone book, is it? What's the idea in getting me up here? Already told you. Curious. I must know what's happened! What's wrong with Dirk? Why wasn't he studying? Why is he disappeared so suddenly? - Do you really want to know? - Yes! Stop it already. Stop it! I don't let you grill me, remember! I told you all I know, so beat it! Carroll! Carroll! I'm coming down, wait. Come. - I have to catch a plane to Frankfurt. - When will you be coming back? I shouldn't ask if you love me, right? Actually not. Bye. In a few weeks I go to New York. We might arrange to get onto the same flight. See you later. Give me a kiss. I have to go. - 104. - 104, certainly. There'll be a call for you at eleven. Thank you. What's the time now? Twenty seconds to eleven. - Daddy? - Are you looking for Dirk Buchheim> Go to the café Donisl today between 2 and 3 o'clock. Ask for Mentler. Hello? Who is that? Well? Are you feeling pleased with yourself? Thanks. I'm looking for a Mister Mentler. He's not here yet but he won't be long. Thanks. Hello. How's it going? There's someone waiting for you, a lady. - I'll go to her. - Fine. Hello. You're looking for me? I'm Carroll Buchheim. You look like Dirk. Indeed you do. - You know Dirk? - Yes. Nothing is for free, am I right? What do you want? It's not easy to split on an old friend. How much? - 500? - Cash, if you don't mind. I only have checks. Well... Start writing. Just sign, we'll fill in the details. Hurry up. His weight slows him down. What do you know about Dirk? Raoul Malsen and your beloved brother were once great friends. Without Dirk's money Raoul would be nowhere. Raoul used Dirk, financially. Dirk tried to use Raoul, not financially. Then Dirk sold his flat and gave his furniture to Raoul. You can see it in his secret apartment. And the money? Have you seen Raoul's mansion? Dirk's money, perhaps. I can't believe it. Since Dirk's disappearance, Raoul never did so well. When did you see Dirk for the last time? Four months ago. The two of them had a drink at my place. As for Raoul, he's one of today's top photographers earning big money and doesn't want to know us. Any idea where Dirk is? No. Hello? Where are you> I thought you'd be at my place. Carroll> Carroll, what's the matter with you? - Don't be stupid. - Nothing. Come on. You know that Mentler hates me? The truth is all that matters now. There are two sides to every story. You only know one side and it's not complete. Dirk followed me everywhere. It's no use trying to explain that to you. Where is Dirk? How should I know. He gave me his furniture. Probably he sold his apartment and cleared out. But not before you take in the hundred thousand marks from him. I just thought you and I could love each other. Let me give you some advice: Go to the police and tell them all that you know. - That's what I'm going to do! - Then let's go! Can I see inspector Arnold please? He's in conference. Go and get him. Only in urgent matters. This is an urgent matter. - Where is she? - Don't know. She was here a minute ago. Hello? I want to see Raoul. And what did your friendly advisers had to say? They said I'd best stick around you, if I ever hope to know the truth. Good advice. Only I'm pretty occupied right now. That could be altered. Not really. We're just starting to get warmed up. Is she really that good? Come on in. She says you're bad in bed. What do you say to that? That answer can wait. All this because of your brother Dirk? You're a determined little kid, aren't you? I can't be blackmailed. Not even for this. I bet you'll lose. - Do you fancy her? - Hmhm. Give it a try. Why? - Are you scared? - No. No. - I've heard you want to meet me. - What do you want? I can imagine you're sitting on right side of the bathtub. - Am I right? - Get lost! Relax, don't upset yourself. - Really. - Get lost! How is Dirk? - You can't offend me. - That wasn't my intention. But someone's got to try to point out you'll get no further like this. You throw yourself at him and he'll eat you alive. You speak from experience? But in my case it's different. Raoul needs me. So I'm stronger than he is. You've got yourself so involved you begin to get annoyed the moment the name Dirk Buchheim is mentioned to you. Why mention it then? Carroll! Let me go! Here comes Raoul. Hello everybody. Have you had a good flight? We've been testing Fashion in Munich. A good idea. However, keep it between ourselves. This is Carroll Buchheim. She's looking for her brother. He was a friend of mine. Oh really? Maybe I could help you. That's nice. It would be wonderful. This your first visit to Munich? Oh no, I was here two months ago. A marvelous city. Attractive and comfortable. But the only thing that I can't stand is that terrible... How do you call it, darling? Foehn. You've got to fight him. And if he wins you call me. Seems she is in the right hands. He changed since the last time. His heads got bigger. Lay off! Change your wig or do something else! Oh, I've got a fabulous idea. I brought a list with me from New York. With all the locations. Oh where's my bag? My God, where's my bag? - Got the permit? - Yes. Since when do you shoot at the Hofbräuhaus? You're never gonna make it as a photographer, keep that in mind. Anything can be photographed providing you don't sit on your rear end all day. Someone I know gets away with it all right! What did you say? If anything can be photographed, then what about old Munich? I feel like getting rid of a lot of you. Then why don't begin with me? I thought we were friends? Are we? What's the hold up with your American friend? She's coming now. Is shouting a habit of yours? I've paid them for the pleasure of shouting at them. They're good for nothing else. I'd have thought, for the next two weeks you wouldn't have time for me? - Why don't you come with me? - Are you serious? Sure. Hello together, I've found it! Great, let's have a look. I hope you can arrange it. The Hofbräuhaus, what do you say? - It will be possible to arrange, yeah? - Wait and see. Dorit, you're full of surprises. Here, check it against our list in, case we forgot something. Girls, listen. - Meet Dorit from New York. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Right in the car. Hey, my list, Raoul. - We'll bring it. - Okay. - Any surprises then? - None. I warn you, if you continue to make fun of Dorit, you'll be out. You should realize how valuable she is. Come on. Are you ready? I've got it. Check it out. Okay, action! Catch. Idiot... Do something. Terrible, do something! More extreme! Wider! Chrissi, step aside! Who, me? - Let's see. - I am sorry, Raoul. Forget about it. Send it to Retzler. It's a long time since I've seen him being so amiable. Chris is wondering how amiable you are. - Chris. It's all right. - Yeah? Go ahead. I've never thought the day would come when I photograph these eyesores. Chris? Okay, okay, doesn't matter. Understand why he's wondering? You hate people. On the contrary. Usually I find I'm too often forced to love them. Or you force them to hate you. Shall we go? Come on, get in. I'm totally exhausted. I've had my fill of jobs like this. Chris, hurry up, I want to work later. I'm on it, Raoul. Come here, you beast. He sticks his nose into everything. Where is Raoul? - Lena, what's all that make-up? - Can't you guess? I have make-up all over me. Look what he's doing. Ouch, you're hurting me. Don't be so sensitive. Will you ever be ready to start? Hey! Chris, give her a hand. And who is helping me? - Come on, get a move on. - I'm always moving. Lena! Come on, do something! Yes, darling. Yes. - How much light? - Ready to go. Okay. - Lena, raise your leg. - Yes, higher. Higher. Higher! That's it. Come on now, look into the camera. Yes, that's nice. Little more movement! And more wind! - She's nothing. - What about me? Come on, darling, move! She bores me even at the monitor. What the hell has happened to your hair? Lights! Don't act like you where dead! - What do you mean... - Shut up! Get that ridiculous wig off! Morons. Do you always work in bed? I always have to work. It was just a joke. We've known each other such a long time. Come on, darling. Don't be silly. - Hello, Mister Vogel! - Hi there. Bye. Ciao. Very well. Bye. Want me to go? You're not in the way. Perhaps you're in the mood for something different. I don't need something different. I love you. Oh by the way, I wanted to tell you I've decided to give up my hotel room. Why do that? It seems stupid throwing away money like this. Doesn't it? - Ran out of it? - Not really. I thought your father was a millionaire. It doesn't bug me if you sleep here sometimes. That's generous of you. But I don't agree with the idea of you moving in back in baggage. You wanted me to die in misery or something? I have no intentions of moving in here, there's thousands of such apartments to be let. - I can easily rent one for myself - No! - Do I have to ask your permission? - Yes, and do you want to know why? I will not be chained down here like some pet poodle. We agreed from the beginning that you'd be flying home, right? Then go on home! Go today if you want to. Grieshaber is here. Do you want to see him? That's a great idea. I'm just in the mood for that louse. Mr. Malsen, I find it infuriating your secretary denying you're here! - I have to say... - Do the photos satisfy you? Yes. That is, no. It was agreed by contract to use the ruins of Munich as your background. You didn't do that. These are studio shots! Oh really? Great of you to notice that. And do you know why? Because these old dishcloths you produced couldn't be photographed in front of a sewer! I'm the customer here. I know what my client wants and what he doesn't want. This I can throw away. Give them here. These are good photos! What do you want with this magazine here? Are you trying to tell me that another photographer will produce better than me? In that case that case take your trash to him! Better get this straight, you will do as I say... as we've agreed upon! Or it's the end of our association, understand? Out! Next time I'll hire you. Get out! Get out! Beat it! I don't want to see you here anymore, you slave! You will regret that. That's enough! Get out! Out! Out, out, out, out! - Studio Malsen. - Is Raoul there? No. Do you know where he is? With Hella. Since yesterday evening. What do you say to that? That I love her, but not rape her. That's quite the contrary to me. Give me the address. Look who it is. Always running into you. Bye. Hello! Hi Carroll. Patty's been calling you, she got a proposition to make to you. I've got a wonderful idea. Could you write a story on Fashion in Munich for us? Have you ever done anything like that? You know what I mean. Something about Munich, about the youth, the fashion, all about everything a young American could possibly want to see in Munich. The Olympic city. What do you say? Patty's already on her way to get information on the subject for you here. Your brother wrote for me as well. And afterwards the two of us can fly back to New York and find you a wonderful job and a loving man. Pat and Anne. Hello. - You ready? - Just a moment. What time's the next flight out to London? In about an hour. Why? They'll fly back. - But they're nice. - Dorit, darling, just look at them! - Maybe you're right. - But you can't do this! You brought these girls over here but I have to work with them! They go back on the next flight. - I'm going to work with them then. - What's wrong? He wants to work with them. He said he can't work with you. I will. I'll go myself. To tell you the truth, you're done. When Fashion in Munich is over you can go go and find yourself another assistant. Ah, that's great. It's the best for our story. Okay, when will you be coming back? Tomorrow morning. Bye. Don't forget the story. Goodbye, Raoul. Ciao! She means it, do your best. There are countless millionaires, but there aren't many like her around anymore. Do you come with me? Here's some more information on Munich for you. - Oh thank you. - Figures, statistics, notes on its history. Raoul is continually provoking you. Why? I suspect he knows more about your brother than he admits. And his conscience is bothering him a little. Perhaps he's cutting towards you because he's afraid you mean more to him than Hella does. Your call from New York I expect. Please give me Daddy. Daddy? We only have 30 minutes left before the next show. Get changed, hurry up. Let's get this show on the road. What's wrong? Move your limbs. Here. What's with that suitcase here? Is the car ready? Hey. Why don't you go on home. - I thought you love me. - Do me a favor and go home. I want her to stay with me. I'm going to bite you. I will have a little look around before the master is changing his mind again. Never heard of distance? - Haven't you got any suggestions for a change? - She has to step aside, the red one. - Hey, move a little. - Patty brought Dorit back. She isn't coming. Foehn. Bye. Hey Carroll. Stay here. - What's the matter anyway? - I have to work. Wait, we won't be long now. Move down a few steps. Hold it! One more step. One more step! Get in pose! One can't say you've much willpower. It's something you should be grateful for. You wouldn't stand a chance with Hello if I wasn't around. Okay, that's it. Split and move to your show. The car's waiting over there. Don't leave any of your gear behind. Always this sloppiness. - Who do these belong to? - Mine! - You can pick them up later at my place. - Well, than they're mine. Come on, Chris! A man with character obeys. Not much longer. Come this way. Come out of the water! Stop. Turn around then. - I thought we were friends. - Who said we weren't? - Why do you manage them both? - You still got Chris. - Chris? - He's so much more suited to you than Raoul. You mistaken this time. Oh, come on, come here. Beautiful. Here, take the camera. And so all this big talk of Raoul's didn't mean anything. And your taste for girls seems to get not much better. Have you ever thought that he's becoming a slave one day? Say, what about your potency? I heard bad things from Mary. And his girlfriend? Still bi? You're completely rotten. Come on, let's go. I think you should take your dirty hands of her! I do what I want as long the lady doesn't object. But I do object! What's the matter with John? Nothing, he got big in the head. Since he married a banker's daughter. Carroll, I would like you to stay with me. - For how long? - As long as you want to. You sound very convincing. I really have to go to New York because of my father. I can't keep putting it off. Dorit flies out tomorrow. I want to stay but... We'll talk about it later. I'll go fetch the others and then we can get this lousy assignment finished. I'll see to that. Bye. What are you doing here? I just look around. Preparing your future career? Does it interest you? Perhaps. Just perhaps? Perhaps. Do you love me? I'd better keep the key to your apartment. Here, take this. Okay darling, don't forget he's a beast. - If he's making problems, call me. - Be quiet. - Bye. - Goodbye, Dorit. - You traveling blond? - No, darling, what do you think of me? From Cologne I'm traveling blue. - I'll see you to the airport. - Oh no, stay with Carroll. Be nice to her. Love her. I love her too. I'll return the car tomorrow morning. - Okay? - Okay, beat it. - Bye then. - With pleasure. - I'll just fix us a drink. - Okay. - Here. - Thank you. She said we should make love, not work. - Is that all you can think about? - No. - Let it ring. - Perhaps it's for me. Yes? Raoul? It's Teddy. You remember> London> St. James Club> Yes, of course. Where're you calling from? From Cologne. We've turned, now comes the visit. - Can I stay at your place? - When will you arrive in Munich? In an hour. You can come and pick me up. Well, Teddy, listen... It'll be just great seeing you. What's the matter with you? I'll pick you up. See you. I've met her when I was in London last week. And I'm intended to sleep with her. If you don't mind. She should be here in an hour. You're disturbing. If you don't mind. You want to know what your brother did with a hundred thousand marks, is that it? He gave it to me, in case you're interested! Do you want to know what I did with the money? I have rented this mansion completely furnished my new studio with it. As soon as I got the money, I threw brother Dirk away. I have no intention of being oppressed. Neither for cash nor for love. Get out! He killed himself. As he was realizing that he couldn't buy me! Get lost! Where's Raoul? What's the matter? Something's wrong. Yes, all right. Miss Buchheim, they've been trying to contact you from New York for the last two days. Here's a telegram for you. If there's anything required, I'll be here this evening. Listen... You... The surprise is obviously unwelcome. Excuse me. - Can I use your telephone? - In there. Hotel Ambassador. Hello. Carroll Buchheim please. - I can't reach anybody. - Just try it once more. I'm sorry. Okay. Thanks. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Get in, I'll take you to my place. Carroll? Her father died yesterday. To the hospital. I have my car outside. EMERGENCY Hurry, she's taken an overdose. No need to panic. You stay here. Tell me what the pills were. - Shall I wait? - If you want. When were the taking? Two or three hours ago. - How is she? - You can go home now. - What have you had to do? - What's necessary. Is she out of danger now? You can visit her tomorrow. Bring some of her clothes and things. - Is Raoul in? - Who are you? His former assistant. Just in time to help me with my suitcase, it's in the hallway. And who are you? His big love from London. You getting my suitcase or not? There. Oh, Teddy. Should I know you? Perhaps you remember Hella, the girl that arrived with Raoul in London. Yes. Thanks for the wonderful night. - I leave. - Go to hell. - Rude bastard. - Where's Carroll? Keep your nose out of my business. Damn folks! It can only happen to me. What are you hanging around for? I'm minding my own business. Your first assignment? What do you think about them? Naturally, my photos are junk. Naturally, only your work is genius. Like everything you do is just great. And what you've done to Carroll is great too. In a few days you'll be on your feet again. This is the best clinic in Munich. Do you expect my confession or what? I expect nothing from you. Dirk thought he had bought me. But he never had a chance. It was almost the same as with you. But you gave me love instead of money. Basically, just another kind of commitment. I defended myself by treating you badly. Hella saw it coming and arranged the meeting between you and Mentler. That was why I couldn't finish with her. We flew to New York. Raoul confessed later that during a boating trip on Lake Starnberg Dirk and he had an argument. Dirk threatened suicide. He jumped overboard and was drowned. In order to avoid complications Raoul destroyed all his papers. Dirk's body was eventually found. But he couldn't be identified. At the time as he was not reported missing. - When is the wedding? - As soon as I'm out of red ink. Chris never takes chances. That's why he's no good as a photographer. He'll never make it. He'll make it. You're rotten. I've decided to believe Raoul's version of the story, though I'm pretty certain he's lying. Instinctively I feel he killed Dirk, or at least did nothing to help him. I live with my brother's murderer and I'm not concerned about it. I know one day he'll tell me the whole story and that is the day I fear.
