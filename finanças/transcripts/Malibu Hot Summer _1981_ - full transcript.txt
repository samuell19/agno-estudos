[MUSIC PLAYING] I guess we'd better find a motel until the next bus comes tomorrow for LA. I can't believe that bus driver, leaving without checking to see that everyone was on the bus. With our luck, we probably won't even get our luggage back. JANICE: Help, somebody. I can't get out of the restroom. [LAUGHTER] [KNOCKING] Unlock the bathroom. Oh, thanks. The knob fell off and I couldn't get it back on. I know. That happened to me and my friend, and we missed our bus. I'm Dit McCoy. Hi, I'm Janice Johnston. Hi, Janice Johnson. Cheryl Reilly. [LAUGHTER] Where are you two girls going? LA. JANICE: That's where I'm going. Would you like a ride with me? I'd love the company. Great. When do we leave? Anyway, I inherited this house right on the beach in Malibu with my cousin Steve. And since I've always wanted to be an actress, this was my chance to finally come to California. Hey, I got a great idea. I'm not going to have you two staying in a motel. You're going to come stay with me. Don't you think you should ask your cousin first? Dit, I think that would be a good idea. It'll be fine. There's plenty of room. And from I've heard about my cousin Steve, having three beautiful girls living there is not going to cramp his style. Boy, is my cousin Steve going to be surprised I came out a week early? Mm, I get good vibes from you. What am I going to get from you? I'd like to go up and see your John Travolta poster. Great idea. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Maybe he's at work. We'll just go on inside. Steve? Oh, no. DIT: Anybody home? Stay right here, OK? Don't move. Cousin Steve? Cousin Dit? Oh. You little cutie. You're early. DIT: Yeah, I wanted to surprise you. These are my two new friends, Cheryl Reilly and Janice Johnson. Hi. DIT: They're going to be staying here for awhile. I told him you wouldn't mind. It's fine. But, right now, how would you girls like to walk on the beach? CANDIE: Steve I can't stay here any longer. Your 15 minutes are up, Steve. Well, girls, I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine, Candie. Candie, this is my cousin Dit. Hey. Cheryl and Janice. Hi. Hi. I just live next door. Bye, Stevie. See you later, girls. Bye. Well, girls, how are things? Why don't you have a seat on the couch and I'll make us all a nice cold drink? She's just a friend, a casual acquaintance, nobody special. You girls have any luggage? DIT: Just Janice's. It's in the car. Ours is at the bus depot. We have to pick it up later. I'll bring it up. Don't worry. I can handle it. Hey, want to go to the beach? Yeah, great. Want to? No, I think I'm going to stay and take a shower. I'm really tired from the drive. OK. Let's go. Bye. DIT: Bye. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Oh, hi, Steve. You're leaving town for a few weeks? Well, I guess I'll have to find someone else to make love to me while you're gone. I mean, you can't expect a body like mine to stay out of circulation, now can you? Well, I'll see you when you get back. Bye, Steve. [HUMMING] (SINGING) Worlds of creation die of cancer, a tender rose hides its thorns. Breast of destiny hold no answer. Again, feelings of scorn. What to do when streets are sleeping? When dreams are done, where to go? Going somewhere can be the joy, getting there can be the woe. Oh. DIT: You're really good, Janice. CHERYL: And that song was so pretty. JANICE: Thank you. Ah, does Candie know you sleep in your flannel PJs? [LAUGHTER] Very funny. Oh, if you're looking for your teddy bear, I think you left him in the kitchen. OK, now how are we going to handle these sleeping arrangements? Well, Cheryl gets up early to jog, so that might disturb a night owl like yourself. So we'll take the guest bedroom. That leaves you and Janice in the master bedroom. Now wait a minute. I can take the couch in here. I won't be lonely. I'll have my teddy bear. No, I'll take the couch. I don't mind, really. The couch is mine, and that's final. I don't want to put you out of your bed, so you stay on your side of the bed and I'll stay on mine. Well, you have nothing to worry about, believe me. And I sleep with a night light. Oh, could you turn the light off, please? Yes, ma'am. [LAUGHTER] Don't you dare say a word. What's the tennis racquet for? To make sure that you stay on your side of the bed. [LAUGHTER] WOMAN (ON TV): I don't want you here. Is that plain enough? You really ought to exercise, Dit. It'll help you relax and make you sleep better. I don't have any trouble sleeping. Don't you want to keep your body in shape? Shh. I don't want to miss this scene. WOMAN (ON TV): You planned it that way. That's so ridiculous. I won't even bother to deny it. But there's some things about your mother you should know. SECOND WOMAN (ON TV): Don't talk about my mother. No matter how hard-- Will the television bother you? No, good night. Night. SECOND WOMAN (ON TV): If it hadn't been for you, my mother would still be alive. She killed herself because of you. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, oh. Ow. Oh. Are you OK? Oh, I twisted my ankle. Let me take a look at it. Oh, that feels better. My name is Brent Richardson. Cheryl Reilly. Sprain your ankle often? [LAUGHTER] No, this is the first time. I'm flattered. Flattered enough to have dinner with me tonight? Un-huh. Good. And so I left Lincoln, Nebraska, and here I am. Tomorrow, I'll start looking for work. Have you heard of any openings for a girls' PE instructor? Is that what you do? Yes. As a matter of fact, one of my clients is a high school principal. He might know of something. That would be great. What do you do, Brent? I'm an investment broker. Do you like it? It's OK, but I'd rather spend my days down here. Hi, where is everybody? Janice went with Steve to the recording studio. Oh, really? I met this guy jogging on the beach this morning. His name is Brent Richardson. He may be able to help me find a job, so I gave him our phone number. Great. What are you looking for? A riding stable. I rode all the time back home. Did you find one? Yeah. Would you like to go with me? No, I think I'll stay and get some sun. Hello? Is anybody here? Hello. DIT: Hi. Hi. I'd like to rent a horse. Well, we're closed on Mondays. You're kidding. I just came all the way out here from Malibu in a cab. Your advertisement in the yellow pages doesn't say anything about you being closed on Mondays. You came all the way from Malibu? Didn't you know there are four riding stables in Malibu? Well, I know. But I came out here because I like the name of your place. Rocky Mountain Riding Stable. Well, you see, I'm from Boulder, Colorado. And I have a horseback there, and I really miss riding him. Well, my name's John Logan. I'm Dit McCoy. JOHN: Dit. Yeah. Well, that's a name I'm not going to forget. Dit McCoy, how would you like to go riding with me? Well, what's your boss going to say? Well, I don't think he'll mind. OK, I'd love to, if you're sure that you're not going to get in trouble. Hey, boss, she looking for me? Dit, this is Pete Fargo. Hi. Very pretty, boss. JOHN: Dit and I are going riding. Un-huh, I see. I really like tall women. I'm only 5' 1". Baby, to me, that's tall. Dit, you got to be bored with him in about 20 minutes. You'll find me in the barn. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Wandering through untouched fields as another season unyields, I sit to watch the birds soar and to sing more unborn songs. Lying down beneath the tree, I think of leaves as free. I recall my love for you and wonder where do I belong. Whenever that time will flare when you'll need me to care, just need my strength to be so near. When you'll come to me to share, I only hope I will be there. But no promises, my dear. Hey, Burt, who's that lovely lady? Janice Johnson. Great voice. I've never seen her with you before. She's a good musician, man. She's a friend of Steve's. VON (ON INTERCOM): Uh, Janice, would you come into the booth for a minute? I'd like to speak with you. Hi, I'm Von Denali. I own this place. Hi, nice to meet you. You know, you-- you've got a great body. Oh, and a good voice too. You know, you could go places. Every year, I sponsor a contest for all the new singers. And first prize is one week free use of my studio and $10,000. All you need is a $50 entrance fee. Yeah, well, that sounds great, but there's probably a lot of competition. I wouldn't stand a chance. Think I'll wait till next year. VON: I think you should do it now, Janice. Do you really think so? Yeah, good. Now that that's settled, why don't we go out to dinner tonight? I shouldn't do this, but I'll give you a few pointers insofar as what the judges are looking for. Well, thanks any ways, but I have a date with Steve. We're roommates. Lucky Steve. If your roommate ever moves out, why don't you give me a call? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? BRENT (ON PHONE): Hi, it's Brent. Oh, hi, Brent. I made an appointment for you to meet with Mr. Ward, the client I was telling you about. Tomorrow morning at Fairview High. Hey, that would be great. I appreciate all the trouble you've gone to. I'm just happy I could help. Would you like to meet me for lunch after your interview? Hey, yeah, I'd love too. Where at? BRENT (ON PHONE): Dock 7, Marina Del Ray. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Hi. DIT: Hi. Brent just called. He got me a job interview tomorrow at Fairview High School. That's terrific. Let's celebrate. I'll fix you one of my famous raw egg and liver shakes. I'll have a beer, thank you. I met this great looking guy today. Where'd you meet him? Works at the stables where I went riding. Oh, great. "Jezebel" is on tonight with Bette Davis. I hate to ask what time. 3:00 in the morning. CHERYL: Ugh. Steve, there's a leak in the bathroom. The carpet by the sink is all soaked. OK, let's go take a look at it. [KNOCKING] Cheryl? Cheryl, I have to go to the john. Well, it's on crooked. I'm gonna have to take it off and reattach it. You hold this pipe right here so it doesn't hit the floor. All right. You know, I think we'd have a better angle if you got up on top of me. Is this better? Yeah, fantastic. OK, now it's coming. [GROANING] JANICE: Will you hurry up? I can't stay like this all night. Just a little bit longer. JANICE: How long does it take? STEVE: I don't know. This is my first time. JANICE: Oh, you're kidding. STEVE: Why would I kid about this? Have you got it yet? Is it in? STEVE: Can't you tell? JANICE: I'm not looking. STEVE: OK, it's coming. Good morning. Good morning. Did you sleep well last night? Mm-hmm. Could I use the recording room to start working on my songs for the contest? I'm sure there'll be one available. I just talked to Ms. Strassman, the secretary. And she said that there was one opening left and I could start this afternoon. I hope I get to work on something dramatic like Bette Davis would. Hey, can I run into town with you guys? Don't even worry about it. He's-- if you're really nice to him, he-- he won't say anything. He'll just-- oh, girls, don't do it again. You know how it is. This school's got a reputation, blah, blah, blah. Oh, I'm not worried about him. It's my dad I'm worried about. All right, ladies. Let's keep it quiet. Well. But you weren't doing anything. Hi. Hello. Is Mr. Ward in? I believe I'm expected. I'm Cheryl Reilly. I'm here about the girls PE position. Mr. Ward, there's a Cheryl Reilly here to see you about the girls PE position. Yes, sir. All right, go in. It's the first door on your left. Thank you. [KNOCKING] Come in. How do you do? I'm Dexter Ward. Hi, I'm Cheryl Reilly. Very nice to meet you. Won't you have a seat? -Yes. These are my qualifications and recommendations. Thank you very much. Mhm. Mhm. You have a beautiful school here. Mhm. Mhm. Hm. Very good. Mhm. Your qualifications are very good, Ms. Reilly. However, there is one very serious subject that we must discuss. I'll be frank, Ms. Reilly. Are you now pregnant or do you plan on becoming pregnant in the very near future? Pregnant? Mr. Ward, I'm not even married. Today, Ms. Reilly, that seems to have nothing to do with it. Every gym teacher I've hired has had to leave because she was pregnant. Our present gym teacher, Ms. Adams, she's leaving because she's pregnant. Our past gym teacher, Ms. Spencer, she had to leave because she was pregnant, and on and on. And none of them were married, Ms. Reilly. Could it be that all that exercising you gym teachers do overstimulates your libido? Mr. Ward, my career is the most important thing in my life. Oh. CHERYL: And I have no intention of becoming pregnant. I wish I can believe that. Whatever happened to the good old days, when women use to get married, stay home, and have babies? When wives used to wait patiently for their husbands to come home with his pipe and slippers ready? Mr. Ward, do I get the job? And his dinner hot on the table. The job? Oh, yes. Yes, Ms. Reilly. Now that you understand my position, you may begin tomorrow. But for the first six months, your status will be that of a substitute teacher. Now, you'll go to the gymnasium and see Ms. Adams. She'll give you your first week's schedule. Welcome to Fairview High, Ms. Reilly. I promise to be a good girl, Mr. Ward. Just remember, try not to overstimulate your libido. Good afternoon, darling. Today, we're all going to learn how to use our imaginations. So let's emotionally warm up by doing a private moment. Ms. Strassman, how do I do a private moment? MS. STRASSMAN: Oh, yes, you're new. What was your name, dear? Dit McCoy. MS. STRASSMAN: How sweet. Did you pay your tuition yet? I sure did, cash. A private moment, dear, is something happy or sad that has happened to you in the past and you try to recall those feelings again. You experience them. Hey, Michelle, we can't get out. The knob fell off the door. What reality, what a personal moment, dear. Wendy, I'm-- I'm sorry about last night. Oh, you are so fucked. You live with your parents. I wanted to screw and you tell you live with your parents. You are so fucked. BRENT: Hi. Hi. How'd it go with Ward? I got the job. Great, this calls for a celebration. Come on, we'll have some of the champagne. Now, Dit, I want you to be a banana. I want you to feel your skin. You want me to be a banana? Yes. This exercise will stimulate your imagination and help you release your inhibitions. I don't think I have any inhibitions. MS. STRASSMAN: We all have inhibitions, dear. Now let's see you do the exercise. Ms. McCoy, what are you doing? Stimulating my imagination. I was peeling my banana. We do not take our clothes off in class, Ms. McCoy. I'm going to give you an exercise you can work on at home. I want you to be a tree in a windstorm. Bring it in next time. [MUSIC PLAYING] Brent, this is beautiful. You know, I really hope this doesn't sound dumb. I'm from the Midwest, and I'm a little bit old-fashioned. I really have to know if you're married. No, I'm divorced. CHERYL: Any children? Mmm-hmm. One daughter, seven years old. I bet you and she are really close. No, on the contrary, I don't even know her. She resents me. I'm sorry. I seem to be putting my foot in my mouth today. No, it's all right. It's OK. Time Magazine wrote an article about me last week. Brent Richardson, multimillion dollar investment broker, rags to riches in four short years. Of course, the article forgot to mention that I was so obsessed with my work that I lost my wife and child because of it. I want to make a toast. All right. To us. You guys have a good ride? Yeah, we did. Thank you. Think you could take these horses for us? Sure. You're a really good rider. Hey, look, how about if I take you home? Then you won't have to take a cab. No, thank you. Why not? Because you haven't been honest with me. You own this place, don't you? Yes, I do. Then why didn't you want me to know about it? Well, because LA women seem to be very impressed with money, so I like to keep a very low profile. I'm from Colorado, remember? Boulder. I have a ranch in Colorado. You're kidding. Where is it located? Near Aspen, it's the Lazy L Ranch. I'm very impressed. It's one of the largest ranches in the area. I also have ranches in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. I don't like LA very much. Well, why are you here if you don't like it? JOHN: I'm only here in the fall, for the horse shows. My home's in Utah. How would you like to go out to dinner? And a movie? Yeah, and a movie. I'll give you 500 up front. The other grand you'll get after the contest. And the same deal goes for San Bernardino, Palm Springs, and San Diego. Hey, man, she's good. Judy could beat these west coast amateurs any day. I say we go for first prize. Yeah. Remember, Von, I just won first place at Palisades Park, remember? Let me tell you the way things are. There never was and never will be any studio work or $10,000. Understand? Look it, I'm not even going to charge you the $50 entrance fee. You'll get your names in the newspapers and appear on TV, free PR. Take it or leave it. All right, man. It's a deal. Hey, wait a minute. You didn't even ask me. Who's asking? I'm telling. [SNAPS FINGERS] Hey, man, that's only a hundred. You better rehearse. I want her to look good, almost professional. What an asshole. VON: Hey, Pete. So, Pete, what do you think of my place? Beats Chicago. Sunshine, swimming pools, and broads. LA's the place, man. You know, Chicago is getting a little heavy. Hey, honey, you're not on top of things. My man here needs a drink. What'll you have, Pete? Scotch on the rocks. She come with the drink? She's yours. So what are you doing in LA? Working with horses. Still a bookie, huh? No. I'm working for a guy that has ranches throughout the states. I'm his right hand man. I supervise everything. Riding stables? Good front, beautiful. You know, I got a similar thing going on here too. I put on these singing contests every year. Fixed, of course. As a matter of fact, those two kids that just left, they're my winners, if you know what I mean. And I get free PR and TV coverage, and my disco makes a fortune. Sounds like a smart operation. What day is the contest? Saturday. Hey, I'll leave a pass for you at the door. I'd like to impress my boss. Can leave an extra pass? You've got it. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Memories come to me this night. Once again, you're in my sight. Still, I wonder why you said goodbye. Lots of laughter we had shared. Times are telling why we cared. The day you left, I learned how to cry. Because I still remember those tears. I still remember those tears when you left. Oh, when you left. In search of yourself to be, you said farewell and left me. In your plans, I did not fit in. Now, we're many miles apart, but you're still within my heart. It's lonely living on without you. Because I still remember those fears. I still remember those fears without you. Oh, without you. All those lonely, lonely fears without you. Well, aren't you going to open your present? Where? On the table up in the galley. I'm gonna go see it. No. [LAUGHTER] You jerk. Go ahead. How does it fit? How do I look? Very sexy. Now for the second part of your surprise. Look in the pocket. Do you like it? It's beautiful. But I can't accept it. Why not? CHERYL: Well, for one thing, we've only known each other a short time. Length of time has nothing to do with it if it's right. We both know it's right. Brent, that's not the point. BRENT: What is the point? I just don't want to get married right now. Look, the reason I left Nebraska was because I felt trapped, like life was passing me by. I went to grammar school, high school, and college all in the same town. I even ended up teaching at my high school. I need time to be on my own. Hey, look, nobody's taking that away from you. You could even quit your work. You'd have all the time you need for yourself. Brent, you just don't understand. And you just don't want to commit. It's either marriage or nothing. Then it has to be nothing. Well, I'm having this party at my place, Janice, and I would like you and Steve to be there. Let me talk to Steve about it and I'll get back to you. OK? VON (ON PHONE): Oh, well, I'll see you there then. Bye. Hi. My name is Dit McCoy. I have an appointment with Mr. Sanders. Coffee? No, thank you. Could you tell Mr. Sanders that I'm here? May I help you? Dit McCoy, I have an appointment. Great. He'll be right with you. Coffee? [EXHALE] Ms. McCoy, I'm Eric Sanders. This is Larry Parker. Tell us about yourself, Ms. McCoy. Well, I'm 23. And I was born and bred in Boulder, Colorado. And, um, I'm working with Stella Strassman. In Boulder? No, Hollywood. So you hadn't had any professional experiences yet. Um, I do a great tree in a windstorm. And my junior year in Boulder High, I did Amanda in the "Glass Menagerie." Tennessee Williams, his best work. I thought that was-- So tell me, Ms. McCoy, when did you decide you wanted to be an actress? Oh, uh, when I was seven years old, my mom took me to see Bette Davie in "Dark Victory." Took the psychiatrist six months to break my habit. What habit? I was smoking a pack a day. That's great, really great. Ms. McCoy, I'm going to ask you a very important question. It is a question I ask all my prospective clients. It helps me decide who and what you really are. I want you think very hard about this. Do you believe in UFOs, Ms. McCoy? Um, yes. Good. We must be prepared and watch the sky at all times. They're coming. I like you, Ms. McCoy. Welcome to Sanders Agency. Chitsu, please come in here. We'll draw up your contract today. Send her our to that soda spot next week. Do you sky dive? No. Yes, you do. The last thing you do in this business is tell the truth. Coffee? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Steve? Oh, uh, I'm busy tomorrow night. I was assuming you'd come up. Uh, yeah, maybe I could see you later on tonight. OK, all right. See you later. OK, bye. Are you available Saturday night? Well, I don't know. I have to check my appointment book. Oh. Listen, my girlfriend Janice is entering a singing contest, and it's going to be at Von's place. And I want you to come. OK, I'll come. Oh, and tell Pete he can come too. OK, I'll tell Pete he can come too. Hey, how are the acting lessons coming? [SIGH] I don't think I did too good last week. She asked me to be a pillow. And I couldn't-- it's not funny. And I couldn't-- she said I can't tell whether it's a foam rubber pillow or a down pillow. What'd you tell her? I didn't tell her anything. It's very frustrating. I mean, you know, I really thought I wanted to do this. And I can't believe Bette Davis had to go through this. You paying money for these things? DIT: Yes. Well, if you don't like 'em, why don't you quit? Well, I-- I just-- I just don't know. I don't know if I want to do it anymore. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh, hi, Steve. No, I'm going out tonight. Sorry. OK, bye. Janice, is everything OK? Steve and I had a fight. Well, aren't you gonna ask me what it was about? What was it about? Well, Steve thinks I can win the contest without rehearsing. He says I'm putting too much importance on it and I'm acting too uptight. You mean, you haven't been rehearsing? I've been rehearsing every day for about four or five hours, but that's not enough, not if I want to be perfect. Oh, I don't know anything about it, but that seems like an awful lot of rehearsing to me. No, you don't know anything about it. Janice, I didn't mean anything by it. Dit wasn't criticizing. Janice, I want to tell you something, and I'm going to make reference to my girls. I tell them that if they're too concerned with winning, they're gonna always lose. I think Steve was right. Listen, you're a good singer and you know it. So why don't you just relax with it and enjoy doing it? Thanks for the advice, but would you mind your own business? Thanks for listening, Candie. I just needed someone to talk to. Maybe it would help if I talked to Janice. No, she doesn't like you too much. One of my appointments is Von. He invited me to the singing contest. Maybe I shouldn't go. No, you be there. I'll see. But right now, I have an appointment coming over. You and your appointments. Well, I'm going to give it one more shot. I'll try and talk to Janice again. Good luck. Thanks. [KNOCKING] Bye. It's my appointment. Hi, Larry. Don't have a lot of time today. Oh. Now, look, this is ridiculous. Where'll you even go? I'm driving home tonight. STEVE: Is it because we had a fight? What about your contest? You tole me it was the most important thing in the world to you. Well, I never was a very good loser. You know, it's that defeatist attitude that keeps you from being a winner. Oh, and you're really qualified to say that? You're such a big record producer. Look, can we just relax and talk this out? You know, I love you. Oh, you don't know what love is unless you pay for it. Did you get your money's worth at Candie's last night? You know something, you're right. You should leave. You're not old enough to be out in the world on your own. When you get your bags packed, call me and I'll carry 'em down for you. Oh, just get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] You know what, Vicky, you can use my studio any time you want. Standing invitation, drop by any time. Uh, Vicky, promise me you won't make yourself so scarce from now on. I'd like to see you around more. Von? Janice. Oh, excuse me. Think I'll go change my bikini. Friend of yours? No, only an acquaintance. I'm glad you could make it to my party, Janice. I was afraid you wouldn't come. Where's Steve? Steve and I had a falling out. Oh, that's terrible news. But then again, who needs Steve anyway? Here, have a drink. To your success in the contest tomorrow night. Janice, you know, I'm in the position to do a lot for you. And I know how important your career is. And, well, maybe we can work out some kind of a arrangement between us? Oh, excuse me. It's OK. Don't be embarrassed. I think my wife left her purse in here. She keeps antacid tablets for my stomach ulcers. My name's Howard Riesling. Pardon me for saying this, but has anyone ever told you you're very attractive? What's your name? Maybe you've heard of me? I handle a few actresses. That's a theatrical agent. You do? I'm an actress. You are? What a coincidence. I'm Vicky Olsen. I came out here all the way from Providence, Rhode Island, just to become a movie star. I really admire your determination. You came all the way across country just to pursue your craft. In high school, I starred in three stage productions. Outsiders just don't understand what an actor has to go through to prepare for a performance. You're right, absolutely right. It sounds to me, with your background, you'll have Hollywood at your beck and call in a couple of weeks. Really? You really think so? That's exactly what I felt too. I don't want to sound immodest or anything, but I really do have talent. Vicky, you've got all the right assets. It sure is lucky I met you. Mhm. Hey, where's Von? Man, you want to get Von back here? I seen a lot of girls come in this town. And he uses them and dumps 'em. Well, maybe that's what I need. Look, I came to this party to leave my cares behind. You know what I mean? Sure. Sure. Really? You really think so, Howard? That's just what I felt, too. Oh, Vicky, you really do have talent. Oh, Howard. Oh, yes, Vicky. Oh, Vicky. Janice, are you all right? Well, can I get you anything? Water and alka-seltzer? Janice, aren't you feeling well? What can I do for you? Janice? Janice? Janice? Good morning. Who are you? Yuri. Remember, we met at the party last night? You were pretty sick and I couldn't see leaving you there with Von. Oh, I made a fool of myself tonight. Hey, don't worry about it. Everybody has a right to let lose once in awhile. Oh, my head's still spinning. What time is it? About 10 o'clock. JANICE: Oh, I got to get going. Look, last night was a mistake. I had a fight with the guy I'm staying with and I was going to leave town. So I went to the party on a whim. And I'm entered in Von's singing contest tonight. And if I'm don't show up, I'm going to be letting a lot of people down. Hey, you've got plenty of time. The shower's the first door on the left. And your clothes are hanging up. I'll make some coffee, sober you up, and then drive you home. Deal? Deal. To the singing contest. May the best singer win. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] I think we're being followed. You mean that's why that truck's behind us? Don't look around. Here, step on it. Hey, Pete, give 'em some time. Pete, they're getting away from us. We gotta stay on 'em. Hang on, boss. [MUSIC PLAYING] Von. What's Janice's number? Your lady going to win that contest tonight? A lot of rough competition this year. This is the number 10. Good luck. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] I want you to throw your car keys out the window. You gotta be kidding. A BB gun? Tell the jerks to get out of our way. OK, man, OK. What are you, crazy? We gotta get to that contest. OK, take your clothes off and get in the back seat. Oh, terrific. We're being held up by two perverts. Hey, short stroke, I remember seeing you at Von's pool. Throw your clothes out the window. What are you going to do? Wear 'em? Watch it. Just throw your clothes out the window. Fuck. Damn assholes. Watch your language, bitch. [LAUGHTER] [PHONE RINGING] Welcome, welcome to Von's Place. Hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight. And now what we've all been waiting for. We're going to begin the contest. First up is BJ McKay, from one of my favorite towns, Turlock. Take it away, BJ. [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) My mother told me don't you sing your daddy's song. But I've been singing my daddy's song all along. Now my daddy left me when I was a little tot. I said I'd never even one. Honey, I'm leaving tonight. And I'm running away again, leaving my problems behind. Leaving my lover, leaving my friend, I'm leaving my trouble behind. Running away again, leaving my troubles behind. Leaving my lover, leaving my friend. I'm leaving my trouble behind. OFFICER (ON RADIO): --witness, wearing a black sweater, brown pants, sunglasses. Suspects also have a thin mustache. There also was a midget who held a gun on him. A midget? Yeah. And this other guy, about 6 foot 4. A midget and a giant. What kind of gun the midget had? A squirt gun? No, he had a BB gun. Will you shut up and just tell him to go get our clothes so we can get going? We're in enough trouble. A midget, the Jolly Green Giant, and a BB gun? OK, kiddies, we're going for a ride. I'm sorry to say that number nine has apparently been held up, so, uh, we will continue with number 10, Janice Johnson. Good luck. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) Wandering through untouched fields as another season yields, I sit to watch the birds soar and to sing more unborn songs. Lying down beneath the tree, I think of leaves as free. I recall love for you and wonder where do I belong. Whenever that time will flare when you'll need me to care, just need my strength to be so near? When you'll come to me to share, I only hope I will be there. But no promises, my dear. Waiting in a tender stream, it's song feels from a dream. Two flowers blossom to share. One's fit to wear, one flies. I wait coated by the sun, one day law say it's begun. I reach for visions of you, but them the wind blew them too high. Whenever that time will flare when you'll me need to care, just need my strength to be so near. When you'll come to me to share, I only hope I will be there. But no promises, my dear. From the dawn of touching you, like a tree, my feelings grew. Not only is there want in love, now I've learned of needing you. During times of restless night, building crosses at new heights, I turn to you and you're gone. So I walk on without you. Whenever that time will flare when you'll need me to care, just need my strength to be so near. When you'll come to me to share, I only hope I will be there. But no promises, my dear. No promises. [APPLAUSE] Stay tuned. We'll have the judge's decision in a minute. You finally got here. Did you get your things done? Yeah, Pete and I took care of it. You missed the whole singing contest. This is what we've been waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner is Janice Johnson. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING]
