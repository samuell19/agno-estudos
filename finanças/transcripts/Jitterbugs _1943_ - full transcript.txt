[ Engine Sputtering ] - Well, we're out of gas. - Well, that's all right. - We still have our gas rationing card. - Gas rationing card? Why, a ''C'' card wouldn't help us here. - Oh, you- - You don't have to lose your temper. - I'm sorry. I- - You're sorry. You were sorry about that redhead in the auto court. You were sorry about that waitress in the barbecue stand. I suppose you're sorry about talking me into taking this road instead of the main road. Well, I'm sorry that I'm sorry, but, if you're sorry, you can't help being sorry. - Oh, get out and hush up. - Maybe someday you'll be sorry. A thousand miles from nowhere. Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into. And don't say you're sorry. [ Sighs ] - Worried, aren't you? - Are you? Well, it must be 1 1 5 in the shade. - How about a drink of water? - That's a good idea. I'll go right now and get it. - [ Sighs ] - [ Sizzling ] [ Yelps ] [ Sighs ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Sizzling ] [ Yelps ] - Hey, Ollie. - What? I can see the back end of a truck. That's no truck. That's me. The back end of a truck. I'm sorry. I- - Ollie! - What? - I see a gas station. - Where? Right in here. See? Look. It's right in there. See it? Give me that. Stanley, we're saved! Well, how are we gonna get this thing over there? Well, that's simple. One of us will push, and the other will steer. I never thought of that. Well- - Hey! - What? - Not too fast. - I won't. When you start pushing, don't push over 35 miles an hour. All right. Let's go. - Hey, Ollie! - What? - Do you mind if I stop a minute? - All right. Okay, Ollie. I'm ready. Well, it's about time! [ Car Door Closes ] [ Hoofbeats ] What would you have done if I hadn't had... presence of mind enough to have you push me? I haven't the slightest idea. I guess the only thing I could've done, if I'd have gone to the gas station- - Who's pushing this thing? - Oh, I forgot to tell you. I borrowed a mule down the road. You remember when we stopped? I guess a mule's as good as a donkey any day. It certainly is. You're absolutely- What do you mean ''as good as a''- [ Horn Honking ] - [ Honks ] - Get out and find the attendant. - I'm sorry, Ollie. - Sorry for what? ''Closed for the duration.'' Now what are we going to do? Hey, there's a car coming. - Let's flag him down. - Yeah, maybe we can borrow some gas. [ Scoffs ] - Look. Here's a truck coming. - Oh, they won't stop for us in this desert. Say, why don't you lie down and pretend you fainted? Then he's bound to stop. He wouldn't let anybody faint on a des- At last, you're using your brain. - Hurry up and faint. He's getting closer. - All right. Yeah. [ Yelps ] [ Horn Honks ] Mister, could you spare us a gallon of gas? A gallon? What are you trying to do, wean this thing? Well, we made a slight miscalculation in regards to our supply. - Yeah, he means we ran out of gas. - Yes. Well, gentlemen, the right man just came along. You're facing Chester Wright, the inventor of the Little Wonder Gas Pill. The answer to the rationing problem. This is the 1 0-gallon size. This is the five-gallon. And, this, gentlemen, is a gallon can of water. Sample it, if you please. I'm sorry. [ Smacks Lips ] It's water, all right. Now, gentlemen, you're going to see a demonstration of the eighth wonder of the world. I'm gonna take some of these pellets... and place them in the can of water you just sampled. - Open your gas tank. - Yeah, sure. Oh! I'm sorry. [ Sniffs ] - Gasoline. - [ Spitting ] Just pour it into your tank, gentlemen. Now, step on the starter. [ Engine Starts ] Mister, you have saved us from an untimely end. Yes, sir. We might've died. - How much do we owe you? - Oh, forget it, my friends. - Regard it as a little courtesy of the road. - Thank you very much. ''Laurel and Hardy. The Original Zoot Suit Band. '' Well, we're one of the wonders of the age ourselves. The only two-man band in the world- Equal to Glenn Miller, HarryJames and SpikeJones. Well, we might get together. I was on my way to Washington to hand these over to the government... but, uh, we might pick up a few bucks on the way. You mean make some money? - Sure. We could make a lot of dough together. - How, Mr. Wright? There's a carnival troupe opening up tomorrow in Midvale,just a few miles from here. We can get a location, and, with your band to attract the crowd... we can trim- I mean, we can sell every sucker- [ Laughs ] I mean, every person in town. - What do you say, fellas? Fifty-fifty? - Well, we could use some money. - Okay, fellas. See ya in Midvale. - Good-bye. - [ Both ] Good-bye! - Bye. - Nice man. - Yes. - Good-bye. Bye. - Good-bye. Bye. - Well, all of our troubles are over, Stanley. - Yes, sir. And we won't need this ration book anymore, will we? - Not as long as there's water. - That's just what I thought. The quicker we get to town- ## [ Swing ] ## [ Swing ] [ Chattering ] Over here! Over here! Over here, folks! We have a free attraction! Now step right in closer, please. We have the Belle Fatima and her dancing- The only explanation we have of this remarkable phenomenon... the Bearded Lady, folks- ## [ Continues ] [ Chattering ] ## [ Flourish ] - ## [ Ends ] - [ Applause ] Come on, hepcats. We're gonna spread a load of jam! ## [ Swing ] - Not bad, are they? - No. That trumpet reminds me of those HarryJames records our store got in this morning. - Are you in the music business? - Sort of. I sing in the choir too. - [ Both Laughing ] - Well, what's holding us back, sister? - Well, ''all reet,''Jackson. - Well, ''all reet.'' ##[ Continues ] ## [ Tempo Increases ] [ Cheering ] - ## [ Crashing ] - Well, folks, that was out of this world. And now we have a message for you. We bring to you good people of Midvale... the greatest invention of the 20th century. What is the most important question today? Transportation. Which brings us to the question of gas rationing. Out of the laboratories has come a miracle: The Little Wonder Gas Pill! Now you simply drop one of these pills... into a gallon of water, and you have a gallon of gas- not ordinary gas, but gas of the highest quality! Now this is the five-gallon size, and this is the 1 0-gallon size. I could sell it to you for a dollar a gallon, but no.! The 1 0-gallon size sells for two dollars. The five-gallon size sells for one dollar. Who wants one? I'll take the large size! I'll take 1 0 gallons! - [ Ollie ] Yes, sir. - Give me 1 0. [ Grumbles ] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How do we know that stuff's on the level? I perceive that you have a water bag on your shoulder. - Is there water in it? - Yeah, full of it. Put this in it. I dare you! [ Sniffs ] It smells like gasoline. - [ Explosion ] - [ Women Gasping ] What more do you want, folks? The five-gallon size or the 1 0-gallon size? - That's enough for me! Give me 1 0. - There you are, sir. - Give me 1 0 gallons. - Yes, ma'am. - [ Man ] Give me five gallons. - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - [ Overlapping Chatter] - All right, folks! - [ Chatter Continues ] - Here's another fin, buddy. Here's your pill. - [ Chattering ] - [ Explosion ] - [ All Gasping ] - Ha! Ha! Never mind that, folks. - [ Man ] I'll take that! - [ Overlapping Chatter] - Right over here! - Hold it! Hold it, folks! Hold everything. Don't hand over any more of your hard-earned money to these crooks. This is a fake! Are you insinuating that we are hoodwinking the public? I dropped one of these Little Wonder Gas Pills into a bucket of water... poured it into the tank of the car... and now- and now look at me. - [ Chattering ] - [ Man ] Hey! Give us back our money! Inspector McNeil of the state bunko squad. I've been trailing these two across the country for days. Jail's too good for these robbers! We oughta take care of'em ourselves.! - You're right. He can't cheat me. - Yeah! - We want our dough.! - Come on.! - They're crooks! Now, folks, don't let your tempers boil over. - These men'll be dealt with by the law. - [ Shouting ] [ Shouting ] - My purse! My purse! - [ Shouting ] What I can't understand is why did you pretend to be a county detective... unless the gas pills didn't have the desired effect? What do you suppose is running this car at the present time? He's right, Ollie. We're going okay. - What happened to the man's car? - He probably got mixed up in the directions... or there was something else wrong with his car. - How much we take in? - Uh, $223. - I'll take my half now. - All right. There you are. - Hey, wait a minute, fellas. - What's the matter? Didn't I split the money 50-50? That's not it. We gotta go back. - [ Together] Go back? Why? - This purse. It belongs to a little girl back in Midvale. I was holding it for her. Why, if anyone sees us in Midvale, they'll throw us all in the jug... and they'll find out that you're really not an officer. - How am I gonna get this back to her? - I'll take it. How did you get here? I got into the back of the trailer when you were leaving the carnival. The question now is, ''How do I get back to Midvale?'' Oh! I got an idea. You two fellas drive ahead to the place where I parked my station wagon. We'll ride back in the trailer. Come on, baby. I'll explain everything in words of one syllable. No wonder he wanted to go back to Midvale. - Why? - Well, because the girl lives there... and he's- Never mind why! [ Engine Starts ] Look, you're doing 7 0 miles an hour. I'm not doing 7 0 miles an hour. I'm not even doing 50 miles an hour. In fact, I'm not even doing 3 5 miles an hour. - Well, it says there, ''7 0.'' - That speedometer's stuck. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know- - [ Gasps ] - [ Tires Skidding ] - [ Laughs ] Why don't you look where you're going! - [ Both Laughing ] - I'll get it. Thank you. Hey, what's this? It's a picture taken when Mother put through a real estate deal on our property. - Ooh, your folks got money? - I've a rich aunt in Boston. - She bought the property for Mother. - What kind of deal was this? Mother puts in her property and $1 0,000, and the eastern financiers put in 1 5,000. It seems to me I've seen one of those faces before someplace. It was around a race track. Uh, Louisville- a horseplayer named ''One-horse Bates.'' You might let me in on this. Honey, I'm afraid your poor old gray-haired mother has been gypped. There's my car, baby. Hop in. I gotta go up and see the Rover Boys. Boys, I gotta drive this girl back to Midvale. - Back to Midvale? - Isn't there any other way she could return? Well, there's more to it than that. From what she tells me... - her mother was gypped out of $1 0,000. - [ Whistles ] - That's a lot of dough. - Yeah. A lot of money too. Yes, and it's worth going after. I have a hunch who the gang is... and I'm gonna try and get it back. You're a mighty swell guy to try and get that money back. - Anything we can do to help. - That's the ticket! I knew I could count on you. - Stay on this route, and I'll catch you. - Right-o! - Okeydokey. - [ Engine Starts ] Stanley, do you believe in love at first sight? Well, it saves a lot of time. Mr. Cass, this gentleman seems to think... that Mother has been swindled in the land deal. This is Mr.- [ Laughs ] - I guess I don't even know your name. - We never got around to that. - Wright is the name, Chester Wright. - I'm glad to meet you, sir... though I'm quite certain that you're mistaken. - The money is in my safe. - Yeah? Ten'll get ya 20 that it isn't- And a ''Wright'' is never wrong. [ Scoffs ] Mr. Wright, I hope you're wrong. A-ha! There, you see. And the signatures, just as I put it into my safe... - Mr. Wright. - Oh, sure. Sure. - Now, who's gonna open it? - Why, I think Miss Cowan should open it... - since she will someday be the owner of the property. - [ Mouths Words ] [ Gasps, Sighs ] [ Gasps, Sighs ] Why, I don't understand it. I put that money in the envelope myself and sealed it. It was never out of my sight until I put it into the safe. - Look, he's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. - He never dropped it? Yes, now that I think of it, but he initialed it before he dropped it... and, when he picked it up, the initials were still there. Why, of course. That's known as the ''old convincer.'' The phony envelope was initialed before he came in the office. I'm going down to tell the chief of police! I'd like to break their necks. I only hope the police catch up with them. What good would that do? Even if the police arrested them... they'd only spend the money on lawyers to defend them. Then if you win, you lose. Maybe, but I've been thinking. - I'm going after that money. - What do you mean? Well... money lost through larceny can often be recovered the same way. Remember I told you I recognized one of those faces- a horse player? Well, what track opens next week? New Orleans, and that's where I'm heading. - Fine, I'll go along with you. - Oh- You know, if we hadn't have run out of gas on the desert... Chester would've never gone to Midvale... and he would never have met her. And now he's going to recover her money. To her, he's a real hepcat- right in the groove. And they'll fall in love, get married. And live in a cottage bowered with roses. A country estate. You know, we could work for them... and we could live in peace and contentment. You paint a pretty picture, Stanley. They could name their first baby ''Stanley.'' - What's the matter with ''Oliver''? - Stanley's a nice name. - Oliver. - Well, they could have twins. - We'll suggest that to them. - [ Horn Honking ] - What's my point, baby? - Six. You know you always shoot sixes, Corkey. [ Southern Accent ] My name is Colonel Waterson Bixby... of Leaping Frog, Amarillo County, Texas. Oh! How do you do, Colonel? We've assigned the Governor's Suite to your party. - I hope you like it. - You all are most kind, sir. Okay, sister, there's your two bits. If I keep on playin' this game, you'll be wearing mink. This is my secretary, Mr. Chester Wright... and this is my butler, valet and general factotum, Potts. Carry those bags upstairs and don't take ''no'' for an answer. [ Bellboy ] Yes, sir. [ Southern Accent ] I have some valuables I'd like to entrust to your care. This one contains $20,000 in currency... and, this, some very valuable contracts and documents. Oh, they'll be perfectly safe, I assure you. Just a moment. I'll give you a receipt. My, what a pretty little girl. [ Sighs ] How do you do, Miss, uh- Let me see. I don't remember your name, but I know we've met. [ Chuckles ] Ah, there goes the colonel again... and he's got the most jealous wife in the whole state ofTexas. That's Corcoran, one of the men at the desk. Yeah. I recognized him from his picture. Okay, you two, break it up. Susan, we'll see you later upstairs. Good-bye, Miss. - [ Sighs ] - You all here for the races, gentlemen? I'm sorry, sir, but business prevents that pleasure. After you, sir. - Corcoran, you might at least have knocked. - Shh! Dorcas, ready money just walked in the hotel. - Kale? Mazuma? Moola? - The old lettuce and plenty of it. A Texas Casanova by the name of Colonel Waterson Bixby... - and a sucker for dames. - That's nothing. So are you. Dorcas, this is business. Listen- Well, boys, we've been in this joint for five minutes... and we've already contacted the interested parties- and are they interested. Yeah, but haven't you- uh, we- spent a lot of money to put over this deal? Say, $1 0,000 is a lot of hay. - It's a lot of money too. - Shh! He's got the corner suite down the hall. Get him in here, and I'll watch for your drink order down at the bar. Then I'll walk in at the right time. Get it? And don't forget to use your southern accent. [ Southern Accent ] Does y'all mean like this, honey? Fine. That's it. I'll be right back. [ Gasping ] Oh, please don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Oh! Oh. Oh. [ Moaning ] Oh, please! Oh! [ Moans ] [ Sighs ] Oh, my hero. I'd have collapsed in the hall if it hadn't been for you. Someone else might have come along, someone not so strong... so gallant. - Come sit here beside me. - Why? - Why, I still feel a little faint. - I'll go get a doctor. Oh, let us have some drinks. Shall I order a couple of sazeracs? I'm sorry, lady, but I don't drink. [ Drops Accent ] You don't drink? [ Southern Accent ] I mean, you all don't drink? - Uh-uh. - Oh, would you mind if I had a little snifter? - I mean, a little sip. - Certainly not. Would you mind pouring it for me? - See, I've sweetened it. One little sip. - Uh-uh. -Just for poor little me? -Just one little sip? Well,just one. - [ Gurgling ] - [ Popping ] You know, that's a bit of all right. I declare, for a Texan, you all have a mighty funny dialect, Colonel. - Colonel? - Well, aren't you Colonel Waterson Bixby? - No, I'm his valet. - What? - Yeah, my name is Potts. - Potts? Yeah. P-O-''Otts''- Potts. - [ Knocking ] - Come in. - Oh, no. That's my husband. - Oh. - [ Knocking Continues ] - [ Gasps ] - Hide! Quick! - [ Whimpering ] No! No! Quick! - [ Whimpers ] - [ Knocking Continues ] Colonel Waterson Bixby of Amarillo County, Texas, my fair lady. As your neighbor down the hall, I've come to present my regards... and convey my felicitations. Colonel Waterson Bixby! I'm mighty proud to meet you all. - Come right in. - Thank you, ma'am. My name is Mary Lu, Colonel. What a pretty name. Can I call you ''Mary''? - Please do. - And you just call me ''Watty.'' Watty, how about a drink? Shall I order a couple of sazeracs? A couple? Why, madam, that's just a three-furlong dash to a four-year-old. Order a dozen, and it shall be Colonel Waterson Bixby's pleasure... my little magnolia blossom. A dozen sazeracs for 807, please. Mary, is that hard liquor I see on yonder table? But that is brandy, Colonel, and I have ordered absinthe. The perfect chaser. Permit me. To the fairest flower in the garden of southern womanhood. - [ Smacks Lips, Sighs ] - Sit down, Colonel. Thank you. [ Sighs ] I've heard no woman can resist you, Watty. Mary,you gonna have a lot of fun provin'it. - You mind if I smoke? - Not at all. Thank you. - Cigarette? - Oh, no, thank you. - Light? - Thank you. [ Ollie Sighs ] Mmm. [ Chuckles ] - Things are moving? - Yeah. Oliver has just walked into the spider's web. Well, I found the third member of the party. He's running a showboat nightclub on the river. - Oh, that's fine. That's where you come in. - What do you mean? Well, I've sort of been worrying, for fear you'd be in the way- if we got in a jam, that is. I'll stick with you boys. Well, don't ya see? Nightclub, singing-That's your racket. You get a job and pave the way for us. We'll move in and clean out the gang. You mean you want me to walk out before I get the money? Oh. Does that mean you- you still don't trust me? - No. - Because if you don't... well, we might as well call the whole thing off. Don't be silly. I trust you, Chester. Don't think I'm not grateful. I'll do as you say. Sit down, Mary Lu. Thank you. - Delicious. - Nectar. Mary Lu, ''absinthe'' makes the heart grow fonder. [ Both Laugh ] - [ Hiccups ] - [ Gulps ] Hold your breath and take nine sips of water. Thank you, Colonel. Watty, you have lovely hands. Thank you, Mary. [ Sighs ] [ Gasps ] Impulsive little creature, aren't ya, darling? Shall we all have some music now? I don't mind if I do. ## [ Orchestra: Dance ] [ Clattering, Squeaking ] ## [ Continues ] Oh, Colonel! You all dance divinely! It must be the gypsy in me. Kiss me, my little dove. So.! [ Thuds ] ## [ Stops ] I find you, my wife, in the arms of another man. Lionel, I can explain everything. - You can explain? - But, sir, you don't understand. I understand everything, sir. I should kill you both and, perhaps, I will. - It was nothing! - Nothing? You call it ''nothing''... when I find this Casanova making violent love to ya? - Why, I'll- - Oh! Oh! And now, Colonel Waterson Bixby, I'll deal with you. I'm gonna name you corespondent in my divorce case against my wife. No, no! Think of my position in society. [ Corcoran ] I'm in no mood for trifling. Can't this little matter be adjusted? Sir, you dare to offer me money? Well,just between two southern gentlemen. Money for my wife? For my honor? For my love? For my children! [ Corcoran ] Your po'little innocent babes. After all, why should the sins of the father be visited upon the children? - How much? - $1 0,000, sir. [ Drops Accent ] $1 0,000! Ten years in jail is more like it... my fine, feathered friend! Who are you? SheriffJonathan Bates of Midvale County. I've got a warrant for your arrest... for swindling Mrs. Audrey Cowan out of $1 0,000. - You can't get away with this. - Oh, no? Deputy! Yes, Sheriff? - Have you got the extradition papers? - Everything legal. - Signed by the governor. - Put the handcuffs on him. Wait a minute, fellas. This can be fixed. Are you trying to bribe an officer of the law? I wouldn't think of that, but you've got to realize... this is just a business deal that went wrong. I'll refund the money and save further trouble and expense. I'll turn my share of the money over to you, and you can give it back to Mrs. Cowan. Well, the main thing is to get the money back. Hand it over. Here's 5,000. That was my split. - What happened to the other $5,000? - My partner, Bennett, has it. Your partner was the one tipped us off you had all the dough. So that's where the squawk comes from. Your partner, Bennett. Bennett. Put 'em up. So, you two cheap grifters thought you could put something over. I got a notion to drill ya. Hand back that dough, smart guys. Hand it over! We were only fooling. Get the handcuffs! Give me the handcuffs! Here you are. Come on. - [ Coughs ] - Hey, put him in the closet! Right. - Oh, no, you don't, Mary Lu! - [ Screams ] - [ Pounding, Screaming ] - Hurry, hurry! We gotta get out of this joint fast!

No. Bennett said he could get all the money in the world from him for a sure thing... but this is evidently a little too legitimate. - He even tried to promote me. - What'd you say to that? I told him the only one in my family with money was an aunt in Boston. Did you say you have a rich aunt in Boston? - Why, yes. - [ Laughing ] Honey, your rich aunt from Boston arrived in town this morning. - Gee, that's swell. - She came here to visit her childhood sweetheart- Colonel Watterson Bixby of Amarillo County, Texas.

Of course, you know I wouldn't consider this investment... - if it wasn't for Susan's future, would I, Watty? - No. She is charming and clever, Miss Emily. I hope you don't mind me calling you ''Miss Emily.'' Oh, no, not at all. You know, I just love the way you show people carry on. - [ High-pitched Giggle ] - For $5,000, I'll give you 49% of the show. - What do you think, Chester? - It sounds like a sound business venture to me. That's splendid. When shall we draw up the papers? - I suggest- - Now, now, sugar pie. I wouldn't be too hasty. This theater business is very risky. I remember, when I was young, I was hooked- Uh, I mean, I invested $50,000 in a musical show. That, of course, my dear, was before I met you. Well, remember, turtledove, it's for Susan... and I want her to have every opportunity. I know, lamby pie, but Mr. Roger Billingham... the biggest theatrical producer in New York, is a personal friend of mine... and I'm sure that I could interest him in Susan. - Well, you know best. - Pardon me, Miss Emily. I'd like to talk to the colonel privately. Colonel, there are a few things I must explain to you. - [ Chuckling ] - Pardon me. Be firm, Watty. Look, Colonel, I don't want anything to go wrong with this deal. This also means quite a lot to me. I have to protect my money- I mean, my future wife's money. Oh, I get it. Yeah, I fully understand. - How about a hundred bucks? - [ Gasps ] Oh- [ Chuckling ] - [ Tapping ] - Well, Colonel Bixby has changed his mind. He now feels the proposition is an excellent one. - Good. Chester, you take care of the details. -Just a minute. I just happened to think that Emily won't have full control of the show. Only 49%. Thank you, Watty. I didn't even think of that. Just a detail. Just a detail. I'm afraid the colonel didn't quite understand my explanation. Pardon me again. And this is the end of the roll, Colonel. Three dollars... and 1 5 cents. - That's all I got. - Well, that's different, Mr. Bennett. I didn't just see it that way at first. One, two, three. - Do you smoke? - Yeah. Get yourself a package of cigarettes. [ Chuckles ] ## [ Humming ] Well, Miss Emily, 50% it is. But the colonel drives a hard bargain. Don't mind the colonel. He'll grow on you. - He won't grow on me. - You know, Watty... I sometimes think you're only marrying me for my money. [ Chuckles ] Tut, tut, tut. - [ Chuckles ] - [ Bennett ] Here's the proposition. You put up $5,000, and I put up 5,000. Then we put the entire amount in an envelope... and you may keep that envelope in your possession until all the papers are drawn up. - Is that clear? - May I think this over? [ Chuckles ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] What do you think, Chester? As long as the money remains in your possession, I can find no objections. - Very well, it's settled. - That's splendid. That's the way we Cartwrights do things. - [ Both Laughing ] - You be at my hotel in the morning... with the money and necessary papers. - I'll be there. - Good-bye, Mr. Bennett. - Good-bye, Miss Emily. - [ Giggles ] Good-bye. - Come, Watty. - Yes. I only want the dough for a flash. It won't be out of your hands two minutes. - What about the show? - I'm gonna forget it. It's nothin' but a headache. - What do I get out of the deal? - This is getaway money. I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars... for the loan of five grand for 1 0 minutes. - Fifty-Fifty. - All right. - You think the old gal will fall for the envelope switch? - Of course she will. How do you suppose I got the five to put in the show in the first place? [ Scoffs ] I'd hate to tell you, brother. You know, Ollie, I was just thinkin'. You know, Ollie, I was just thinkin'. - What about? - Nothing. I was just thinking. - Boys, have you got everything set on the envelope switch? - Oh, sure. You realize we're gonna make the switch first and beat them to it? - You haven't got a thing to worry about. Has he, Ollie? - No. After you've made the switch, slip me the original envelope with the money in it... and tell me to go down and put it in the hotel safe, and I go. - What's gonna happen to us? - Make some excuse to leave and hurry to the railway station. I'll be waiting there with the tickets. - What about Susan? - Uh, she'll be there to meet us. I gotta go down and pay the hotel bill and get our baggage out. - You boys better get set. They'll be here soon. - Right away. And, boys, be careful. We're dealing with one of the toughest mobs in the country. I'm doing my best with him, Chester. One false move, and we'll all wind up in the bottom of the Mississippi... wrapped in concrete. - [ Door Closes ] - Wrapped in concrete? Are you sure you've got that envelope routine straight in your mind? - Certainly. I've more than got it. - Let's see it. Now, I've got two envelopes. - This one contains torn strips of newspaper. Right? - Mm-hmm. And this one contains $1 0,000. - Now, Bennett gives me the $1 0,000. - Mm-hmm. Then I give it back to him. See, I- I knew it! I knew- Give me- Now, this envelope contains torn strips of newspaper. Put that in your pocket. Now, I'm Bennett, and you're Stanley. Now, this envelope contains $1 0,000. Put that in your pocket. How can you give me the envelope back when I ask for it... if you've got it in the other pocket? - But you didn't ask me for the other envelope. - Give me the envelope. Here. Now, you're me, and I'm you. How can you be me when you're Bennett? - You just told me you were- - You're Bennett, and I'm Stanley. - Well, where's Ollie? - He's standing over there somewhere, anywhere. - I don't get it. I just- - Sit down. Sit down. We're practically wrapped in concrete now. At the bottom of the Mississippi? Yes, the bottom of the- Never mind the Mississippi! - Where's 41 0? - Right over there, sir. Thank you. - [ Knocking ] - There they are now. [ Knocking Continues ] - Are you sure you've got the money? - Right here. Now, don't forget to be dignified. [ Knocking Continues ] That's fine. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, Colonel. Good morning, Miss Emily. Here we are- ready, willing and able to do business. This is Mr. Queen, an associate of mine. Mr. O'Grady and Mr. Taylor, who are also interested. Charmed, I'm sure. Oh, pardon me. My adviser, Colonel Bixby. - I call him ''Bixie'' for short. - How do you do? I brought along the currency, Miss Emily, in thousand-dollar notes- five of them. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Of course. Five more. Thank you. Now we'll put them in the envelope... as per the agreement. There you are. You hold on to it until the details are completed, Miss Emily. - Thank you. - [ Door Opens ] - Hello, Mr. Wright. - Mr. Bennett. - My secretary, Mr. Wright. - How are ya? - That completes everything, Miss Emily. Good morning. - Good-bye. Oh, by the way, for our mutual protection... don't you think we'd better put a mark of identification on that envelope? Oh, I- I don't think it's necessary. Really. Oh,just a matter of business, Miss Emily. Well, maybe you're right. Hey, Bixie? Mm, I think so. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. - There you are, Miss Emily. - Thank you. Well, that makes the deal as solid as concrete. Maybe, Colonel, you'd better keep this for sa- Well, how about celebrating? Let's have a snort of bourbon. [ Chuckling ] Emmy means a little libation. I think I have a bottle in the next room. Miss Emily, if you'll give me the envelope, I'll take it and put it in the hotel safe. That's a good idea. Thank you. Good day, gentlemen. How about the bourbon, Bixie? I'll go right in and get it, Emmy dear. Pardon me, boys. You know, gentlemen, I'm one of those nip-and-tuck drinkers. What's that, Miss Emily? One nip, and they tuck me away for the night. - [ Giggles ] - [ Both Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] [ Stanley ] I feel so gay. - [ Giggling ] - [ Laughing ] - Did you ever hear the one about- - Emmy? I can't find the bottle. Where'd you put it? Excuse me. I'll be right back. Shh! [ Whimpering Quietly ] What a character. If I hadn't a-seen it, I wouldn't have believed it. What a character. If I hadn't a-seen it, I wouldn't have believed it. - I told you it'd be a cinch. -Jimmy. Watch that door. What are you trying to do, cross me? Cross you? I've been slipped the business myself. Catch that dame! - She's ducked. They beat it. - Let's get outta here. - [ Whimpering ] - Come on, sister! Where's that dough? - I haven't got it. Really. - That secretary stooge has got it, hasn't he? Yeah. Mr. Wright- he took it to the office. Bennett, if you're on this frame, it'll be a slight case of murder. I'm not that dumb. We were taken. This pair's crooked. Where's Wright? That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. - Why, you! - [ Groans ] [ Whimpering ] We were only trying to get it back for her. Oh, I wish you weren't a dame. Wright's probably on the way to the showboat to pick her up. That's our next stop. I don't know who crossed who! All I know is I'm out five grand! Somebody's gonna pay it back to me, or else! I was on the level on the play. I just wanted the dough for the old convincer. - I was gonna turn it right back. - Then you were played for a chump. Here she is, Tony. So this is the little gal who dug up the pretty trap you walked into. - Smart. - Where's Wright? - Come on. Tell us. - I don't know where he is. - When'd you see him last? - The other day when he was here with you. - Don't they know? - He's disappeared. I'm afraid he's hoodwinked all of us. [ Crying ] We've been left holding the bag. [ Blows Nose ] - You framed all this. You know where he is. Tell us. - Lay off a minute, Bennett. You mean to say Chester was just fooling us all the time... that he never really intended to pay me back the money? I'm afraid he's made fools of all of us. Yeah. You and the two dames were stooges for a smart operator. And you fell for his gag like a corn-husker from the wide, open spaces. Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea. I'll take this joint over, open just like you planned. Later on, I'll bring in the bird cage, roulette wheels and dice tables. I can clean up. And you're gonna stay because I need you in the show. And I like you. I got an idea we're gonna be good friends yet. - You stick here and watch her... and Bennett. - Me? Yes, you. You do a swell act, but I wanna look over your lines a bit. Maybe you and Wright are planning to split 50-50. -Just a minute- - Take these two Halloween masks down to the boiler room... and keep 'em there until I decide what to do with 'em. You're gonna get a nasty letter from our lawyer for that Halloween crack. [ Queen ] Get out.! ##[ Orchestra: Dance ] My goodness. It's chilly in here. - Here. Put this around you. - Thanks. Hey, Mike. Hey, Mike. - Yeah? - Go down and tellJoe to put some more fire in the boilers. - We'll have the customers sitting on their hands in a minute. - Okay. ## [ Continues ] Hey,Joe. Boss says to fire up. - People are freezing their ears off upstairs. - Yeah? That's where you come in, buddy. Make with the shovel. - Me? - Yeah,you. - And no beefs about it. - Well, what about- So you're one of those guys that have no respect for the opposite sex. Make with the shovel. Come on. [ Yelps ] [ Yelps, Blows ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Loud Clattering ] Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into. - I'm sorry.
