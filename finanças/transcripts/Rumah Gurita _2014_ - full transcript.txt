Sometimes we cannot comprehend the reason... ...why we were born into this world. At times, we feel as if we are worthless... ...regarding our own situation. Sometimes we cannot accept what is within us, of who we are. We feel that the world is too cruel... ...and eventually close ourselves up. Today, we'll do something different compared to yesterday. We'll learn how to paint the human object. Here we have a model that you have to paint. Each person has a unique way of expressing... ...what he paints on his canvas. So I will allow you freedom in painting our model, alright? What is this? Hey, Selina. What did you paint? Selina. Selina! What did you paint? I only gave the instruction... ...to paint a single object up front. What's with this? Forty years ago, the Dutch carried out a massacre at this place. A few of them were hanged here. They asked me to paint them. They demanded that I do so. Whatever. Ma'am, Sir. Selina didn't do this only once or twice. She's done it numerous times. I'm sorry, but Selina can no longer participate in this campus. She's been a tremendous disruption to our campus community. THE HOUSE OF OCTOPUS Don't you feel the chill? Yes, actually. -Why aren't you wearing a sweater? No. Are the windows open? -No. Why don't you go check? They aren't. Perhaps they aren't closed properly. They are. Wonder if there are cracks or gaps? None. The chill isn't from the outside. Something's coming. It will leave in a moment, though. She's lost her marbles again. I'm fed up with her. I can't stand her any longer. Just let it be. She's like your own sister. It isn't freezing anymore, is it? Selina behaves like a lunatic on a daily basis. Shouting, chanting, performing rituals. She even claims to see apparitions,... ...claims that they haunt her. What apparitions? They don't exist! Fine, she was an orphan entrusted to my parents. But when till? Ever since my parents passed away, she fell under my responsibility. A sister isn't supposed to be a burden. She's always acted strangely and now she's getting worse. Look, her friends deserted her. Her boyfriend left her. She was even expelled from campus all owing to her strange behavior. What about me? I see her every single day. I can no longer stand her. Not to mention people's whispers. Honestly, I'm in the same boat. But what else can be done, Laras? Besides, if we were to kick her out of this house,... ...where should we tell her to go? Selina. There's a great university in Bandung with an arts department. It even has a painting faculty. I think this would be a great fit for you. Don't you want to finish college? The application's still open... ...and classes don't start until next month. You can do this, Selina. You have the talent. It would be a shame if you don't finish college. There's no need to worry about the tuition. Though once you have the funds, pay it back. How about it? Alright, I'll go. Fabulous. Then you can prepare to move tomorrow. Thursday. That way you can acclimate there first... ...while waiting for classes to start. Also, your parents' house is in Bandung, so you can stay there. My parents' house? Err, yes. Actually, your parents have left you a house. Why did you wait until now to tell me? Because I believe this is the right time for you, Sel. Come to think about it, you're an adult now, right? You can live on your own, can't you, Sel? Why don't you live there? Rather than leaving the house vacant and abandoned,... ...it's better if you stay there. What is that? That's the house. Selina. Selina, everything's set and the house... ...is almost completely furnished. The furnitures used to belong to your parents. The rooms are already spotless. Iwan and I came by last week to clean everything up. You can use the rooms now. Iwan has also brought your... ...belongings and paintings to that room. Selina! Laras, I don't like this house. I don't like the aura. Selina, you could experience new surroundings here. A new life. You could also make new acquaintances... ...who could later become your friends. Everyone will be friendly to you as long as you act normal. Didn't you always say you want everyone to accept you? To care for you and to love you? You can have all that if you don't act like a freak. You have to work for it if that's what you really wish for. Besides, this is only temporary. My funds to support you is about to be depleted. You don't want to keep relying on me, don't you? You have to sell this house to make some money. You would be able to buy a smaller house,... ...set aside some savings, pay for tuition, wouldn't you? And we could split the profit. To pay back for what we've contributed for you. What is it, Iwan? Why do you want to split the profit? We want to get rid of her, right? That's why w had to dump her here... ...since there's no other place. We even had to reveal that she inherited this house. And as to why we have to split the profit, well... ...because without her consent,... ...we'd never be able to sell this house, Iwan. Let it go. We're about to run out of money. Who are you? In fact, who are you? This house belonged to my parents. I live here now. I'm sorry. I'm the neighbor behind you. My name is Rio. I had no idea someone's living here now. The house is usually vacant. I often come here. To contemplate, lounge around, paint. I come in by climbing over the back wall. I don't know why I always find this house calming. I often find inspiration here. Don't pay no mind. Just another brooding artist. These are excellent. Thank you. I'll be off. Bye. -The gates are up front. Sorry. Again, my apologies. It's alright. If you need any help, just call me. As a good neighbor, I'm at your service. Especially... ...since the neighbor's as beautiful as you are. Now that the house is occupied,... ...I can no longer drop by on a whim. To lounge around, to contemplate, to paint,... ...or can I? I won't climb through the back wall. I'll make sure to knock first. To ask for your permission. Or can I still climb over the back wall? Feel free to, as long as you don't surprise me. Thank you. Selina. Rio. See you. Bye. FRIDAY Who is it? Come on out. If you don't show yourself, I'm calling the police! Selina. Sel? Selina! Selina! Selina! Sel? Sel? Selina! It's me, Rio. This is Rio. It's okay. Rio, Rio. It's me, Rio. Selina? Sel? Why don't you go in? The electricity's back on. Blackouts are common around the neighborhood here. But they only last for a little while. The lights go back on afterwards. By the way, what were you doing at the basement so late at night? I forgot something there. I slipped and fell. Then the lights went out. There was a cockroach. I was caught off guard. That's why I screamed. I'm sorry to have bothered you. It's quite alright. I'm the one who should apologize. I climbed over your wall yet again and crashed your door. The way I heard you scream,... ...I thought something had happened to you. I'm fine. You can go back to bed. I'm not sleepy anymore. By the way, where are you from? And why did you move? I'm from Jakarta. I plan to go to college here. Taking up painting at the Bandung One University. Really? I go there, too. I just came back from a painting exhibition earlier. The students organized it. It will run throughout the month. Do you perhaps have any finished paintings? I do. Go ahead and join the exhibition. Show it. I bet your painting is beautiful. I believe that. Believe it a hundred percent. You believe in me? -Yes. Why? Usually nobody's ever believed in me. I know how it feels to be someone... ...who people find hard to believe in. I'm sorry. So how about it? Do you have any paintings... ...you want to show at the exhibition? I do. Is it okay if I stay here for a while? I want to fix the door. I broke it down, didn't I? It's alright. That way I could also... ...spend more time talking to you. That's the idea. The painting is in the room. Let me go get it. Rio. Selena? Why don't you go home? -Wait, Selena? Sel! I'm sorry, I don't have the painting. But you said..... -I left it in Jakarta. But I wanted to fix your door that..... Thank you, Rio, but I can handle it myself. Mr. Iwan speaking. Selina? What? You want to return to Jakarta? Give it to me. Selina, you want to head back to Jakarta? Yes, Laras. Can I? We don't have any savings left for you, Sel! I already told you that you have to sell the house. You can move anywhere you want to with your share afterwards. What's the update? Have you sold it? I haven't marketed the house, Laras. Something's off with this house. I don't want those who will live in this house be haunted. Let me settle things at this house first. I will market it then. What is it now? If you don't want to sell the house, I will. I don't want you to live here anymore, Sel! I've spent a fortune on your living cost. SATURDAY Hey! Sel? Are you okay? What is it? I plan to go to the painting exhibition this afternoon. Want to come with? I also want to introduce you to the other students. That way you'd feel at ease once classes start... ...since you'd already know a few people. Let's go! I'm sorry, I can't. SUNDAY HUNGRY Selina? Sel? Sel, Sel. Are you okay? Why are you sleeping outside? It's nothing. Why are you avoiding me? Did I do something wrong? I don't want to nurse hope if I'd end up being hurt anyway. MONDAY A worship ritual? Yes, Laras. It's on the roof, near the octopus sculpture. Sel, those sculptures were made simply to cover the gutters. It has nothing to do with worship rituals. And what you say are rituals must merely be..... But, Laras, there are offering plates at the site... ...and they might very well be used for worship rituals. Sel, listen now. You always claim to be... ...haunted by apparitions left and right. I don't believe you. There is only one world, Sel. Ours right now! And if it were true other worlds... ...and spirits exist just like you say,... ...they have nothing to do with this house. No matter where you are,... ...be it in Jakarta, Bandung, anywhere else... ...You would still see them, right? Would still see, be visited, be haunted, wouldn't you? Here. A letter of authorization to sell the house... ...and the profit shares agreement. You aren't willing to sell this house,... ...so you have to give me the authorization to do it. I've marketed the house and found a potential buyer. We could split the profit by two. Remember that I've given you time to immediately sell this house. But now Iwan and I have to sell it ourselves. You end up doing no work. So it's 20 percent for your cut and 80 percent for me. That's already a generous cut for you. Hurry up and sign this. It's late, I need to head on home. Laras, I don't want to burden either you or Iwan. But I beg you to give me time to market this house. If it's sold now, it will hurt others. Let me take care of the issues surrounding this house. Too late. Sign this. Sign it! Laras, Laras! -Get over here. Laras. Don't, Laras! -Over here. Get over here! Laras, don't. He likes to haunt this room, Laras. Laras, Laras! -Get in there! Laras, open the door. Laras, I'm scared! Selina, you've leeched off of me. Such a pest! You're such a stuck up for not wanting to pay back. I'm begging you to open the door first, Laras. He haunts the room. I'm terrified! Nobody will help you, Selina! I'll only open the door if you sign the deeds. Alright, Laras. I'll sign them, but please open the door first. Laras! Laras, open the door! I beg you, please open the door! Laras, he haunts the room! Laras! Laras, please open the door. TUESDAY "Delving Into the Spiritual World" THIRSTY Rio, Rio! Rio. -Sel? Rio. Sel! Sel. I'm terrified. I'm afraid of everyone looking at me as if I'm a freak. I'm afraid of everyone pushing away. I'm scared of being labeled out of my mind. I don't want to be rejected everywhere,... ...just like in Jakarta. But I don't know who else to ask for help. I don't know who else to talk to. I don't know what to do. What can I do to help? I simply ask... ...that you believe me. If you could believe me,... ...that already means the world to me. You said it yourself. On how difficult it is to get someone to believe you. Ever since I was nine, I could see the other world. He often visits me. Often shows himself and haunts me. No matter where I go, they're always there. I believe you. I'm the same as you are. I can see... ...what normal people cannot see. I know how it feels to be like you. Know how it feels to be ostracized by your own family. By your own friends. By your own siblings, even by your own girlfriend. I used to live in Jakarta as well. Then I moved here because... ...people in Jakarta saw me as being different. After I moved here, my parents began to understand. They guided me to those who understand my situation. From then on, I slowly learned a lot. I learned considerably on how to handle my fear. On understanding their world. On how to face them. Well, at least from then on I could live a life that's more... ...normal. Everything's in order. Come. Come on in. He likes to haunt there. He was under this bed last night. I did sense something odd about this house. Ever since I moved here three years ago. Something is living here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you any of this. I didn't want you to be afraid of this house. Or afraid of me. He isn't just some creature who is merely passing by. He's been haunting this place for a long time,... ...but I don't know what he is. He doesn't want to reveal himself to just about anybody. Only those who are staying here, who stay over, who live here. Perhaps he doesn't actually want to bother you. Perhaps he's just trying to communicate with you. Wants something from you. Those spirits from the other world... ...have their own way of communicating with us. It may be unusual for us, but that is their way. Do you know what he might want? I can feel it. He's different. He's different, unlike the usual apparitions that I see. He must have a connection to this house. With the offering plates. With the ritual site upstairs. He is indeed different than the others. He isn't an ordinary spirit, let alone a ghost. I truly have no idea what he is. But what I do feel... ...is that he has a power that can't be trifled with. Rio, what's going on? I'm not telling. Just something to get you to relax, alright? Watch out. Careful with the stairs. One, two, three. Do you like it? It's so beautiful, Rio! This means a lot to me. What's this for? I want to show you something. How did you do that? Your eyes were covered when I held the cup! Having a sixth sense can be a fun thing, can't it? If you fully concentrate,... ...gather your thoughts to focus on what you wish to see,... ...you'd be able to do it as well. So when you said the other day... ...that you didn't want to nurse hope... ...if you'd end up getting hurt anyway..... That was because of your sixth sense, wasn't it? I won't leave you like your friends did, or your boyfriend. I'm so sorry! I want to try. Alright. Paint what you wish to know, what you wish to see. Alright? Bind your thoughts and soul to it. Let your inner eye speak through the canvas. Alright? I want to know what that is. I know this creature. A djinn. He's the one who holds absolute power over this house. And this is what he wants. An octopus. He's hungry, he needs to be fed. He demands an offering. An offering? Of what? A live octopus. And we can't offer it to him as is. There are rituals to follow. The hauntings you encountered all this time,... ...those are instructions on how to present the offering. HUNGRY THIRSTY I won't give him anything. Once I give him an offering, he'll ask for it again. Every Friday night, at midnight, for the rest of your life. I won't do it. I won't have anything to do with him. I don't want to have any ties with him whatsoever. I didn't ask him for anything. I'm not a djinn worshipper. But you're living in his house, Sel! This is my house. He's the one living in my house. He's the one who has to leave. -It can't be done. We'll force him! You'll force him. You must know how to cast him out. No one can, Sel. He has possessed this house even before you came along. You have to fulfill his request. If you don't repay him, don't present an offering... ...you will die. This Friday. Anyone who stays at this house... ...only has one week to give an offering. And you can't run away either... ...since he'll follow you no matter where you go... ...even if you no longer live in this house. WEDNESDAY What are you looking for, sir? A goldfish? An octopus? Which one? -This octopus. How many? One? -Just one. I learned a lot from the paranormals regarding djinns. I know how to perform the offering rituals,... ...but I can't help you carry it out. I can merely guide you. You have to perform it yourself afterwards. And one more thing. You should never carry those prayer beads around with you. To him, it's a symbol of refusal. Defiance. You will never be able to truly merge with him... ...if you still carry the prayer beads everywhere. Alright? THURSDAY When you place the offerings,... ...no one else can be in this house except for you. I'll head on home for now. FRIDAY He's eaten it. Everything will be safe now. Hey, what is it? I forgot that you wanted to barricade the door. I was wondering what the noise was. There were no more hauntings last night, were there? You don't have to be afraid any longer. You don't have to worry about the door opening, either. Is there no other way? I can't perform offering rituals forever. I can't live here forever, either. Someone might buy this house in the near future. Don't play with fire. ONE WEEK LATER (THURSDAY) Sel, where are you? It's Friday night, it's almost midnight! The octopus..... There's no octopus! I want to move. I can't stand it anymore! I don't want to remain under the djinn's power. The buyer is moving in tomorrow. What should we do? They'll be haunted as well. But it's your life at stake. You want to die? Rio! Rio... Rio, take a look! Look at this. These are my parents. They were djinn worshippers. They were the ones who built this House of Octopus. They perished with my brother... ...because they no longer wish to worship the djinn. They were killed. And this..... That baby was me. The sixth sense that I possess... ...was from the djinn. Because I was born at the house, exactly at midnight, on a Friday. And each midnight, his power reaches its height, just as mine. I know how to confine the djinn into his bottle. His true dwelling! Only I can do this. -Don't, Sel. You'll get hurt. But I can't live forever under the djinn's grasps! But I don't want you to be damned! I already am, Rio. Rio, you have to help me find the bottle. Now. -Sel. Here are the prayer beads. To imprison the djinn. Help me find the bottle. Selina. FRIDAY I summon you, ruler of this house. I summon you, ruler of this house. I summon you, ruler of this house. I summon you, ruler of this house. Rio! Rio. Rio, Rio. Rio. Wake up, Rio! Rio! Rio, wake up. I ask you to willingly leave this world. Surrender! I ask you to willingly leave this world. Surrender! I ask you to willingly leave this world. I ask you to willingly leave this world. I ask you to willingly leave our world. Surrender! Surrender! Enter the bottle. Dwell in it. Forever in pain, forever imprisoned. May all your powers be weakened. By the true power that created the whole universe! By the true power that... ...holds the whole universe! I imprison you, banish you forever! I imprison you forever! Rio. Rio. Rio, wake up. Rio! Rio! Rio, wake up! Rio, wake up. Rio. Rio. Rio? Rio? Rio. Rio, wake up. Rio. Rio. Rio. You don't want to take 20 percent of the sales? No, Laras. This house doesn't belong to me. It belongs to something else. I have no right over this house. Whatever, but that means I have full rights over the house. A hundred percent However, Laras, I beg you, whoever will occupy this house,... ...please tell them never to open the bottle with prayer beads. I've kept the bottle in..... I'm rich, Iwan. I'm rich! -"We". We are rich. "We". We're rich, aren't we? What's with the "we"? Nothing. ONE MONTH LATER You're different now. You're always smiling. You look happy. I have a new life now. Everything's settled, there's nothing bothering me anymore. Don't tell me you don't see spirits anymore? Not even at your boarding place? None at my boarding place,... ...though in other places I do. Like on campus. Only I know how to handle it now. You thought me how, didn't you? I have close friends now... ...and I also have a boyfriend. Rio, thank you for teaching me... ...how to engage my sixth sense. I am now able to make a living. As a paranormal, I can help many others, can help myself. I can pay for my tuition and boarding. What is it? I saw something. You. Me? You often think of me. You were afraid of me entering the house. You often watched over me. You always said you were looking for inspiration,... ...you wanted to paint, to contemplate..... Those were only excuses to come see me. You found it difficult to reveal the truth about the house. You also found it difficult to declare your feelings... ...because you were afraid that I'd be terrified of you. And you... ...were also afraid of me. Because of our sixth sense. I never dreamt that someone could love me so sincerely. And I've never felt this way before. Sel. No matter our situation, our condition..... One day we'll cross paths with the one destined for us. We only need to be patient and... ...believe. As for me, I've found the person. You. And this world is just. I'm sorry, sir, but we can't lower the price any more. Yes, how about it? Hello? Hello? Let it go, Ras. We need the money. Just give it up, rather than not being able to sell house. Heck, no. Where's the profit in that? I don't care, we have to ge a good price for this house. But we need the cash! -Who told you to go bankrupt? Our house has been repossessed and our savings are running low. This is all your fault. We had no choice but to move here. You go find a job... ...and I'll keep trying to sell this house at a high value. I don't want to live in poverty. I want to be rich! FRIDAY What kind of bottle is this? Selina once told me of a bottle. Who knows what kind. She said never to open it. But what's the use in believing her? She's a freak afterall. See, nothing happened, right?
