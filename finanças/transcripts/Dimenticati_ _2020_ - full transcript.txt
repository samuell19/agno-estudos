This house, it belongs to the Mad Sisters. They're witches. BETTA: I have a scary story for everybody. It's the story of the exiled. They can enter the bodies of whoever looks them in the eyes. That's how they trick people and get their trust. (THUDDING) Betta, you don't remember me, do you? I'm Andrea. I'm your brother. We can use that door to get there, but you'll need the keys to open it. And both of them are hidden. -BETTA: Andrea, we're coming for you. -(DOOR LOCK CLICKS) RICCARDO: This old castle, both exists and doesn't exist somewhere outside space and time. BETTA: Andrea, it's you. This chamber holds all of their stolen memories. -Faster! Faster! -Come on, hurry up. (ALL PANTING) -MATTEO: She's getting closer, guys! -BETTA: It won't open! Help me, guys! (BOTH GRUNTING) -ANDREA: You got me out. (CHUCKLES) -BETTA: Yes! (CHUCKLES) -RICCARDO: And there's a new riddle. -What? Auntie, it's us. I'm afraid that you're mistaken. I would've loved to have a niece and a nephew. I'm not anyone's aunt sadly. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) THE KNIGHTS OF CASTELCORVO (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) -(CHUCKLES) -(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) What's wrong? -(CHUCKLES) Are you nervous? -(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) A little bit. I just never thought I would come back here. BETTA: (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I'm excited for you to see them. Mom, Dad, we're back! -(CHUCKLES) Hey, Mom. -Who are you guys? -Why are you here? -Mom. Hey. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) BETTA'S DAD: Honey. What's going on? I think that these children came to the wrong house. Mom, what are you talking about? We're your kids. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Sure, but next time -you're over there, are you... -(CHUCKLES, SCREAMS) -It's a thief. -A thief? Where is he? Oh, no. Ah, is this what you're talking about? That's right. 'Cause we either had a break-in or someone got rid of all my things while I was gone. He's only a child. Young man, how did you get in here? What? There's a key under the vase, but anyway, I wanna know what happened to my Coleoptera. This is a joke, right? Okay. Mom and Dad, you could stop. -Mom, Dad? -Wait, what? MATTEO'S MOM: Are you trying to mess with us? What do you mean? Why don't you go home to your real parents, okay? MATTEO: But you are my real parents. Uh, Dad, wait. See that? That T-Rex, you've got it on the internet. It's super rare. You would never let me play with it. Uh, the little soldiers, the little soldiers! When I was five years old, I broke one on accident. Well, you probably don't need to remember that one. Ugh. Our vest, Dad. Look, just look. Am I right? They're the same because we got them at the beach. Don't you remember? No. I'm sorry. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (DIAL TONE BEEPING) -FEMALE VOICE: Hello. -Mom, hey. GIULIA AND RICCARDO'S MOM: Sorry. Mom? It's your son, Riccardo. GIULIA AND RICCARDO'S MOM: No. I don't know anyone named Riccardo. Um, you've got the wrong number. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Mom just hung up on me. Now, everyone's forgotten about us completely. (SOBS) It's like we don't even exist at all. (SOBS) Look at this photo. Now, both of us are missing. Wait a minute. We're not in any of the photos I took in Castelcorvo. I'm sorry. This is all because of me. BETTA: No, it was me. I was the one who dragged you all into this. -I should have played the game by myself. -(SOBS) That's enough. We can't blame ourselves. We still have one riddle left to solve, remember? "Only one got away, but nobody forgotten must stay. "To be remembered again, three words, the same result as what's been." -(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) -(PHONE CHIMES) ARCTIC - DESERT CLEVERNESS What did these words mean? (SNIFFLES) MATTEO: I think I got it. This has to be a game to find the mystery word. I used to play it a lot during car rides with my parents. (SIGHS) No. Basically, the object of the game is to try to find a word that links the other three words together. So, we need to find some word that connects "desert," "Arctic..." and "cleverness." That doesn't sound very easy. No, no. You just have to let me focus. Desert, Arctic, cleverness. Cleverness, Arctic, cleverness, cleverness, Arctic. It could be fox, right? Fox could really be the solution. Yes, fox, because a fox is a clever animal that lives in the desert and can also sometimes live in the Arctic. -Yeah. -(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) -(CHUCKLES) -Where do we look for a fox then? (SNAPS FINGERS) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Are you thinking what I'm thinking, little sis? Yes, exactly. Of course, there's the fox's burrow. Come on, follow me. This is the burrow. And you think there might be a fox inside there? At least there was a fox here last spring. A fox and her litter lived here. Oh, fantastic. So, we came all the way out here because way back in spring, a fox was in there. She could be taking a nap in there. Who knows? Not really, because foxes don't hibernate. We should still check it out though. -(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) -(CRICKET CHIRPING) See anything? -No fox in there. -See? I told you. No, no, no. Wait a second. Something is in there. Looks like, maybe a note inside a ring made of metal. Hey, that could be another clue, right? I'll grab it. -(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) -(GRUNTS) -Almost got it. -Should I try? No, no, no, I got it. (GROANS) I can't reach it. (SIGHS) Oh, yeah! Oh, I've got a roll of string... and a special hook. -What's that thing? -This is a magnet. Let's try and fish it out. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) You got it? Almost. Just a second. A little more. Yes, I've got it! (ALL EXCLAIM) Come on, let's see. Hey, you were right, Matteo. It is another clue. "Three leaves of allaudia procera. "Two large sheets of homemade paper, a raven's feather. "These ingredients once combined hope you'll soon find." -Sounds like a recipe or something. -GIULIA: Yeah, it does. Good. Then we have another lead to follow. We should start with gathering all the ingredients. -Yeah. -Allaudia procera... -RICCARDO: Huh? -Never heard of it. I have, fortunately. I also know where to find it. -Paper's something I can do. -(SCOFFS) Right. Don't believe me? Then come with. All right. Where do we make it? In our garage. Our parents won't be home until later tonight, but the door is always open. Great. Okay then. You make the sheets. You guys look for the leaves and I'll find the feather. We'll meet up when we have everything, okay? Any idea where to find that plant? Of course, I know exactly where to find it. -All we have to do is... -Hi, you guys. -MATTEO: Hi. -Wanna let be today? Let's see. Give me the usual, Gianni. Thank you. Usual. What do you mean? (SIGHS) Uh, sorry. May I have one strawberry shake? -One shake. And you? -I'll have a lemon sorbet. -Just lemon? -Just lemon. GIANNI: Okay. -Just lemon? -I'm lactose intolerant. Gianni used to know that. Of course, now he doesn't remember. Well, he doesn't remember my usual either. That's what the Stria took from us. I wish I'd never agreed to follow her into the Nowhere. Anyway, what was it you were just saying? I was just saying that I know plenty about allaudia procera, 'cause of my Coleoptera collection. I should say, because of the collection I used to have. Anyway, I know where to find the plant. It's actually one of the favorites of the duvalius. RICCARDO: This is ridiculous. To make paper, you need more paper? -It smells. -Don't freak out. It's only glue, right? That's gotta be enough, right? Okay, Mr. Expert. How much do you think we need? (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) But you're not even stirring it right. -Well, go ahead if you know everything. -Ah! (CHUCKLES) Look, let me show you. (SNIFFLES) And just for the record, it's you who sucks at everything. -Uh-huh? -Uh-huh. Yes. Watch, you might learn something. This is real life. Not a point and click game, okay? -(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) -(CHUCKLES) So, how long does it take? An hour, more or less. Well, then I guess I should have gone with Giulia. Oh, really? Too bad. You're stuck here now. (LIQUID POURING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CAWS) ZENO: Giulia. You. -You made it out, but how did... -Yeah. How did I escape from your mother? I saw the pictures. Yes, I am the Stria's son. What do you want from me? The keys, is that it? Go on then, take them, just get on with it, so that we can be forgotten by everybody. And your mother will be free to hurt whoever she wants. -But I... -Oh, you did what? You probably helped her kidnap all of those children. My mother didn't kidnap anyone. The children in the Nowhere are there because they wanna be. -(EXHALES) Yeah, sure. They are. -The Nowhere is a wonderful place. -Everyone's happy there. -That's a lie. It's a prison there. -No, you're the one who's lying. -Oh, really? Because we were all just exploring that wonderful castle of yours after freeing one of the kids your mom had trapped in there. ZENO: Giulia. We need to go find Andrea. -Who are you? And what do you want? -(DOOR CLOSES) I've trapped your brother already. (LAUGHS) GIULIA: Ricky, do you have the Evening Key? RICCARDO: Of course. STRIA: No escaping Maddie's elite children. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) -BETTA: Let me go! Get off me! -Betta! You're staying here with me, forever. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Impossible. I've always believed in her. I've always been wrong. What are you trying to do? Forgive me. You were right. I understand you. -Is this another trick? -No. Here. Is this what you're looking for? Well, yeah. Then take it. Thanks. Now, go back to your friends. I need to clear something up with someone who's been lying to me. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) -(BELL RINGING) -ANDREA: There you are. -Did you make the paper yet? -We did. -Let me see. -Think it'll hold? Well, I wish you let me dry it a bit more. I know they're not perfect but I think it should work. Are you sure you did this right? -Yeah, I'm sure. Don't worry about it. -Yeah. Yeah. -So, were you able to find the leaves? -Yeah, uh, we got a bunch of them, right here. In case we need them. -GIULIA: Hey, you guys. -Giulia! -I found the feather. -Okay. That's everything. -Fantastic. -(PHONE BEEPS) Sure enough. A new area appeared in the game. Check it out. -(PHONE BEEPS) -BETTA: But isn't that... ALL: The Mad Sisters' House. -(WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) -(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (CROW CAWING) Why have you lied to me for so long? (BREATHING HEAVILY) The Nowhere isn't a paradise at all. I knew Giulia was right. That little girl is trying to deceive you. No. You're lying. You've been deceiving me for my entire life. When you speak to me, you will not use that tone. You don't get it. That's it. I'm never speaking to you again. -STRIA: Zeno! -Shut up! -Zeno, look at me! -Shut up! I am your mother. You will listen to what... -Just shut up! -STRIA: ...I say. (GLASS SHATTERING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) I'm not your son anymore. -(GATE CREAKS) -(LEAVES RUSTLING) (CROWS CAWING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, you guys. I don't know about you, but I'm nervous. I don't want the sisters to put another curse on us. Where do you think we have to go? (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) SISTER 1: Welcome back, young knights. -(WIND BLOWING) -(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I was beginning to wonder if you would even come. (SIGHS) Oh, no. I wouldn't miss this for the world. You, finally asking one of us for help. I'm not asking for your help. I'm hiring you. -I'm in need of your services, Exiled. -My services are expensive. Can you pay? -Name your price. -I want my exile to be over. I want to be able to walk among the humans again. -And do with them as I please. -That's quite a lot. Well, you do need my help. Once I have my keys again, you will have what you ask for. There's one more thing. It's my son. He's after the keys as well. And he's also been misbehaving. You want me to punish him? -I want you to protect him. -From what? That girl he's so taken with. And she has the keys as well. (LAUGHS) A simple task and one that will be very satisfying. -All right, then. Do we have a deal? -I will take back your keys. And bring your son back to you. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
