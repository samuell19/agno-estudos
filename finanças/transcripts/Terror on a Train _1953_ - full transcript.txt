What are you doing on railway property? - Taking a shortcut. Come of it, mate. You'll have to think of a better one than that. What's your name and address? Got that? Well, here is the description. About five foot eight. Age 25 to 30. Clean shaven. Dark hair. Brown eyes. Blue tweed coat. Grey flannel trousers. No hat. No overcoat. Last seen turning into Park Street, less than a hundred yards from here. Allen? Oh, he's alright. He'll have a lovely eye on him in the morning. Don't go winking at anyone or you'll open up that cut again. Right. I'll let you know if anything else happens. The city boys have sent out a general call for the perisher, Charlie. Don't you fret. They'll get him alright. Get him? They won't you know, Sarge. By the look of it, you'd think he tried to do repair work to the rolling stock. What might this be? Hold it, Sarge. That's a detonator you're playing with. That's right. Tap it a bit harder and you'll lose all your fingers. Are you sure. Charlie? - I'm sure alright. I never stopped mucking about with these in the army. Now what can a bloke want in a goods yard with a box full of detonators? We'd better find out. Hello? Exchange? Get me Control, will you mate. Hello, Control? What's been through here since nine? General freight. Yeah. London Express, yeah. Anything else? Special freight consigned to Portsmouth Naval Dockyard? Aye-aye. What was she carrying? Thanks, mate. This looks like a hot one. Hello. Railway headquarters? Give me the Super. Oh, he's in hospital is he? Well then, give me Zone Security. Mr Warrilow. If he ain't in his office, get him at his home. Hello. Warrilow here. Yes? What? Coat. Yes. Yes, I see. Right, now listen to me. Inform Control straight away. Tell them to find the best place to park the train. And send Baron to City Headquarters to wait for me. I'll be over in 10 minutes. Have you got that? Alright. Do you have to go out, Jim? - Yes. What is this time? - Oh, it's probably nothing. I shan't stay longer than I have to love. You know that. Don't go sticking your silly neck out. Stick my neck out? What do you think I am, a new recruit? Now you got to bed and don't worry. Goodnight Tim. - Goodnight. And now, my Lords Ladies and Gentlemen. Pray silence for the Chief Constable of Birmingham. Sir Evelyn Jordan. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. Oratory is an art. Little practised in the police force. We are, I'm afraid to say slaves of this stereotype. In that we have two short and very unpopular speeches. Upon which we pin most of our faith. The first one is: "I hereby charge you .." "With offence, trespass, misdemeanour .." "And being a general nuisance in more ways than one." Yes, Reed? I'm afraid I must ask you to excuse me. Sorry to drag you away from your dinner sir, but I'm afraid this is a stinker. Your men are out on the job already. Right. Tell me about it as we go along. Who is it? What the devil ..? The mist is getting thicker. Going to be late at this rate. Well cheer up, Josh. What's a bit of mist? A bit of mist is a thing that causes pile ups. I wish we was all in cabbages. There wouldn't be much of a pop if these cabbages went off. That's about where she is now, sir. Couldn't we allow her to carry on until she got to the open country? If she went up going through Redhill she might kill thousands of people. And don't forget there is traffic coming through the other way. Passenger stuff. No, she's got to be diverted. There is a siding here but I doubt if we could stop her in time. How about Felsworth? - There is an old siding there, sir. But it is mighty close to a lot of houses. Pardon me, sir. I live near that siding. What's it like there, Briggs? Any open ground? - Not much, sir. Just the old station yard. Better than nothing. Get the police, Jenkins, and tell them that's where we'll stop her. My house? My wife? Couldn't you ..? Sorry lad, the more we delay the more danger there will be for everybody. The police will lose no time evacuating people from the danger area. Don't worry. Hurry up now, I'll get the thing diverted. Fog around, isn't there. Tell them to put warning signals on the line. Have the signalman make the crew get the engine off when they abandon the train. We can't afford to throw away locomotives for no good reason. We asked the Navy what the effect .. Of an explosion of a train load of sea mines would be. What did they say, sir? In a circle radius - 500 yards. Complete destruction of all houses. Next circle - 700 yards. Severe damage. Outer circle - a 1,000 yards. Danger from flying glass and falling tiles. Got it? We'll have to evacuate everybody within the outer circle, won't we. I'm afraid so. Get them moving, starting with the houses nearest the train. There must be up to 5000 houses in that circle. Yes. With an average of three people per house. You'll need a lot of buses. Can I use the street taxis also? You can have anything you like but hurry it up. Right. Anything else, sir? No. Give me a call if you want anything but take it without asking. Right, sir. Evening Branson. - Evening, sir. Found the blighter, sir? - Not a sign of him. He got away before the call went out or he's gone to ground .. And it will take a month of Sundays to find him. I am afraid so. Willard came in just now. They raided every hole in the ground in Birmingham. Yes. What now? It seems to me we've got to try to do something brighter .. Than watch roads and railways and search a few more boarding houses. Indeed we have. Your man Baron might be our trump card. Can we borrow him? You already have him. He's in the office looking through your rogues' gallery. Baron. Come in, will you. That's a lovely shiner you've brought yourself, constable. Yes, sir. We've just about decided that your man might have left the city. If he has, where do you think he'd go? Portsmouth, sir. Why Portsmouth? That's where the train is going. If I were the beggar, I'd want to see what damage I'd done. Good. So would I. Do you mind if we send him to Portsmouth? No. Of course not. Right. We'll provide you with a car and arrange for somebody to meet you. You will be in plain clothes. You got the idea, Baron? I've got it, sir. Thank you very much indeed. Good luck my friend. I hope you make the pinch. A bright lad, that. Now what about the explosive experts? We're running through our files now to see who we can turn up. I'll give them another call. Filing room here. Yes, sir? You might try this one, sir. He's right here in Birmingham. Major Peter Lyncort. Royal Canadian Engineer's bomb disposal unit. "Born Quebec, Canada." "Now employed by Anglo-Canadian Machine Tool Company LTD, Birmingham." "Home address. 34 Greville Road Birmingham 12." He is married. [ French language ] [ French language ] Now say it again in English so I know what you're talking about. I am leaving you! Don't you understand that? I am bored. I hate your work, your friends. The way we are living. Will you stop laughing at me like that. Don't you understand? I've had enough. Now look. When you've calmed down I'll be downstairs having a drink. That's your answer to everything, isn't it. [ Three signal bangs! ] Three? Blimey, the emergency stop. Birmingham has been on. Some joker's been monkeying about with your load. It's liable to blow up at any minute. You've got to hurry. You've got to abandon the load. They said to divert you to the Felsworth Siding. That's what they said. You're all clear. But be gentle round the curve. That line isn't used once in a month of Sundays. Who has been monkeying about with our load? How do they know? - I knew they were mines. If they all go up, there is enough to flatten Birmingham. I know nothing except what they've told me. They said it were terrible urgent. Don't ask questions, mate. Abandon the load? I don't know that we can properly do that without proper instructions. Look. I'm giving you instructions. I've told you twice. You're to take her to the Felsworth Siding. They said that. Direct orders, they said. Abandon the load, they said. Uncouple the Loco and drive her away. Aye-aye, what's up? - You're to back off. He says we're in trouble. You're better off back on. We'll tell you about it later. Do as he says. Don't ask questions. Go up ahead and I'll switch you on to the siding. Felsworth Siding, you said? Yes. Will you get a move on! I'll do my duty but I'll not lose my head, not for your nor anyone else. Jump on, Arthur. We're going for a joyride. I'll send for the rest of my luggage tomorrow. Goodbye, Peter. - You're really going, aren't you. Yes. I am really going .. home to Paris. Just because you're bored, that's no reason to .. to break up a marriage. I'm trying to save a marriage, Peter. Not break one up. By running off to Paris in the middle of the night? You are just trying not to understand. I'm frightened. This is the tenth quarrel we have had in a week. You started it. I did? That's what I mean. They were not all my fault. - You just said they were. I did not! I said I started them. I had every right to. Darling, what does it matter whose fault it was with these silly little quarrels. That's what I thought too. But don't you see that .. That a lot of little quarrels can spoil a marriage as easily as a few big ones? You're making that very plain to me right now. Well, I am going for a rest. From quarrels, silly or otherwise. And Birmingham! Look, I didn't ask to be in Birmingham. The company sent me here. What do you want me to do? - I don't want you to do anything. Except be the man I married. You married a soldier on wartime leave. I wed a girl who drove a wartime Jeep. Do you want to go back to that? - I wish we could. At least then you were gay and gallant and alive. Now I'm just a .. Just a dull businessman. Is that what you mean? - Yes. Just what I meant. - Right. Nice to know where we stand. Maybe your life can revolve easily round making nuts and bolts but mine can't. And if you don't know it, it's time you found out. I've told you a thousand times we don't make nuts and bolts. "Armaments" then, or whatever it is that pushed me out of your life. I remember the time when I was important to you too. You still are. - Oh, no I'm not. Just look at me once the way you used to. I am a woman, Peter. A woman! I know you're a woman. Now let's stop all this. Come on, I tell you what .. Let's go down to Carlo's and get ourselves a bottle of champagne. That's what we always do. It never solves anything. Look, if you'll just wait awhile we'll go to Paris with you. We'll go together. We'll have a vacation together. Then come with me now. Now, please darling come with me. Without hesitation or argument or anything. You know I can't come now. I got a hundred appointments tomorrow. You always have appointments. You're not coming back? I don't know. There you are. Enough steam to drive the Queen Mary. Could we have missed it? - No. Well how long since you been up this bit of line? It's some time but I haven't forgotten it. Well if there is a pub within a mile of this place we'll break the door down. We could do with a drink after this lot. Here we are. Come on, Arthur. [ Pub singing. Loud. ] Shut up! Shut up you noisy drunken beasts! Sorry, Mrs M. I'll do my best to keep them quiet but it's old Harry's birthday. That's why. Quiet gentlemen, please. Let's have a little bit of quiet. The cops! We're being raided. No Ken, it's not even closing time. Come on, all out. - What's the idea? Oh, Major Lyncort? Yes. I'm Warrilow, of the railway police. Could I have a word with you, sir? Sure. Thank you. - Come in. We're pretty sure the saboteur set his device to blow on arrival at Portsmouth. We shouldn't ask anybody to go near the train. What time is the train due at the dock? - 6:40 tomorrow morning. 6:40? Hmm. Let's see. That gives you a little less than eight hours. Of course, you know it doesn't have to be a time mechanism. It could be a booby trap, could be a proximity device .. Set to detonate by the heat of an adjacent body. Talk about the age of science. Well? You picked kind of a bad night for me. I've just had a row with my wife. A job like this takes a man with steady hands. Sorry, but steady or unsteady you're the only man in the area who can help us. Well. Looks like you're stuck with me. I hope they've not thought up anything new since I bought my way out the army. Oh, do you mind if we stop by a hospital on the way? Of course not, but what for? I want to pick up an electric stethoscope. And I'll need some tools. A first class single to London, please. The next train is not until 2:15, Miss. Isn't there a train at 10:50? Not since last month. At 10:30 but it's gone. In fact you're liable for a longer wait than that on account of the trouble. Trouble? There is a train down the line full of explosives liable to go up any minute. How terrible. Well. I think I'll wait all the same. Jimmy, will you hurry up! If you don't come down now you'll catch it. I can't find my pants, Ma. Well come down without them but hurry up. Charlie. Charlie. What's the matter, Ma? Why aren't you moving? I've lost our Charlie. You follow the others. Don't worry, we'll find the boy. Oh, he ain't a boy. He's older than what you are. He won't know what to make of all this. If he goes out back and sees that train he'll never come home. He loves trains. Well off you go, all the same. I'll find Charlie and bring him to you. Alright, but mind you talk civil to him or he won't come. Alright. Charlie. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie? Charlie .. where are you? Is that you, Sarah? Sarah is looking for you, Charlie. Come on. Over here and I'll take you to her. There hasn't been a train here for years. Yes, I know. I like trains. This is not a good one for you to like. Charlie! Sarah is worried stiff. I don't care. Charlie, come on. This is no place for you. Leave me be. Sarah wants you. Let her. I'm going to stay here. Do you grow these? - Yes. Pretty, ain't they. I'll tell you something. There's lots better ones over there. In the churchyard. Come on, let's go and pick some. - Yes, yes. But that would be stealing. Not if we get permission it won't. Don't worry. I'll have a word with the vicar. But he won't let you. I want to stay and see the trains. I don't want to go over there. Come on, over here, Charlie. - I can't see .. You're alright Ma, don't you worry. We'll have you tucked up in bed again in no time. I ain't worrying, mate. Aren't you? - No. I can't get more than a couple of hours sleep a night anyhow. Why should I object to a nice little outing. Well, that's one way of looking at it I suppose. You wait until you're as old as me, boy. You won't be frightened of anything. I'm 84 you know. 84? Strewth, I thought you was 30. I was going to ask you come with me to the picture on Saturday night. Ah, go on. Thank you. What a night, sir. I never knew there'd be so many people in such a small area. I knew. I worked it out. I had no idea it was going to take as long as this though. Better hurry them along, Sergeant. They are moving too ruddy slowly. Where is Inspector Branson? He's right over there, sir. Hello, sir. Branson, this is Major Lyncort. He's going to search the train for us. Rather you than me. - How far is it from here? About two hundred yards. Reed, show him the way to the train. Straight through the graveyard. That's an ironic touch. Let's get down to the next assembly point. There she is. [ Church bells ] Are you sure you won't want any help? No. Quite sure. Those mines must weigh over a ton apiece. You can't move one of the mines to plant a charge. I won't have to move one to find it. Thanks anyway. Very well. If you need a hand, flash the light or just holler. Good luck. [ Church bells ] See if you can stop those confounded bells. They give me the jitters. [ Church bells ] They are moving now, verger. We can do without the bells. This is an emergency. It is my duty to ring the bells when there is an emergency. Stop ringing now. Off you go to see that your wife is safe. Aren't you coming, vicar? - Yes, now. With any luck sir, they won't be harmed. As always, we are in God's hands. Yes, sir. We have an expert who is searching the train. All the same sir, it is time you got out of here. This glass would fly something cruel if the mines were to go up. I will only keep you a minute. Almighty God, in your great mercy. Protect your children in their danger. Protect also .. Their belongings and their homes. Protect the police and the railway men. Who are risking their lives in the performance of their duties. Especially protect .. The brave man who is walking alone. Into the valley of the shadow of death. That will be fourpence, please. I would be obliged if you keep your eyes to yourself. Just giving you your due, my dear. Respectful admiration. Very respectful. Do you mind if I sit here, Miss? Still waiting for the 2:15. I don't like these late trains. But I am due at a very important meeting in London at 9:30 in the morning. Very important. The board of directors of a big company. Ladies clothes. That's my line. Je suis Fran?ais. Je ne parle pas Anglais. I like French girls. Beaucoup! Will you go away. I thought you said you didn't speak English. I speak English better than you do. Go away. The trouble with you my dear, is you're tired and lonely. Now if you have a trouble you ought to share it. You never know, I might be able to help you. You have me wrong, madam. I'm not in the habit of forcing my company on ladies. Pardon me. Where are all the taxis? - They've been commandeered, Miss. That trainload of mines down the line they think has been sabotaged. They are having to evacuate half the suburbs. I must try and catch a bus. You won't catch no bus, neither Miss. They've been commandeered too. Where do you want to go to, Miss? I don't know. I haven't decided. - Better make up your mind, Miss. You shouldn't be wondering about by yourself. Can I come up? Who are you? - I'm Charlie. I like trains. Get off this one and stay off. That's what the other man said but .. But I like trains. I don't care what you like. You must get away from here. But I won't do it. I want to stay and play too. But .. why did you hold me like this? He's flashing his light. I wonder what's up. It's as much my train as it is yours. Why, it's Charlie. Charlie, I sent you to Sarah. Why didn't you stay there? - I couldn't find Sarah. I don't want Sarah. I want the train. Leave me alone. Don't take me. I want to see the train. I don't want Sarah. You too. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Buenos d?a Se?ora. How are you tonight? - Fine, Carlo. Fine. Is my husband here? - No. What have I done that you haven't come to see me for so long? What do you mean, so long? We were here less than a week ago. One week that you are not here is like a year Se?ora. Well, hasn't he been here at all tonight? - No. I haven't seen him since the last time you were here together. I thought maybe. He might still come. We do not close before 2:30. Why not come in and be seated? Well, I would like a sandwich or something. That's right, Se?ora. And I will bring you a bottle of wine of the kind you both like. A cup of tea, sir? - Hmm? Good for you, Reed. Where did you find it? Somebody left the back door of the pub open. Breaking and entering? What's the police force coming to. It's coming to its senses sir, if you ask me. What did you put in it, a distillery? - Just a tot of rum, sir. I've brought one for Major Lyncort. - Oh no you don't. I'll take it to him. - I can take it to him, sir. Never mind. Lyncort, I've brought you a mug of tea. I thought I said to stay away from here. All the same, I hoped you'd like a mug of tea. It's got half a bottle of rum in it. No luck with the electric whatnot? - No. What are you doing now? Taking off the cover plates. There is nothing on the outside. What about the booby traps and all the other horrors you mentioned? No, I think we can forget about that. I've been pretty careless. If there had been any booby traps we'd have known about it. At least you would have. Would it be safe to say you are on the home stretch? The only trouble is the home stretch is the longest part of the track. Now beat it so I can get some work done, huh. Have you got all those wagon-loads to search? It's nearly 2 o'clock. With four and a half hours in hand at the outside, you haven't got a chance. It doesn't have to be in the last mine. What do you think you're doing? - Two pairs of hands better than one. Look, I said I don't want any help. You may not want it, but you need it. Now, don't be a fool. I'm not clumsy nor particularly stupid. You said yourself there can't be a booby trap. Look, there may be a trip device right under that plate you're sitting on. Will you please go back to the graveyard. Three hours ago you were probably right to refuse help. But I don't think you are now. Why not tell me what a trip device looks like? Alright. You asked for it. I hope you don't get it. What a relief to be in complete agreement for a change. I hope so too. Now you see this bolt here. Now you loosen this bolt. Very, very carefully. When that's loose. You lift up this cover plate. Very gently. Lift it up enough to put your fingers underneath to see if a wire is there. When you're sure there is no wire. Then you take the cover plate off. Now you look inside and try to find something. Just to be sure, though, you take this stick. And you probe around inside. Very, very .. carefully. You see? - What if I find a wire? Well, if you find a wire, you .. Break the news to me in a very hoarse whisper and I'll try to disarm the thing. In the meantime, you do a bit of praying. If there is no wire, what am I looking for? A box, a bag, a bundle. Here. - Thank you. Probably some home-made device. You might as well start working on this one here. I am sorry, Se?ora. It's 2:30. The law sways we must close. I'm sorry, Carlo. Can you call a taxi for me, please. - There are no taxis. Oh of course, they've been taken. For the people who are going to blow up. Maybe they will not blow up. On the midnight wireless .. They said there was a man working on the mines to make them harmless. I wish they had all chosen another night for it. If the Se?ora would allow me, I would drive her home. Thank you, Carlo. This Se?ora would allow. Peter. Eleven cars to go and two hours to make it in. We're not going to make it, are we. - Not at the rate we're going. Would, you like me to get Reed to give us a hand? No, let's stick to the no-amateur rules, eh. I seem to remember. You've had an intensive course, you've graduated. You're a BBD. You're a Bachelor of Bomb Disposal. I'm not a bachelor in fact. Yes. And neither am I. Do you think you'll remember the joker's face? I'll remember it as long as I live. - Well, try not to spoil it. He may have a mother. - Him? He wasn't born. They found that perisher under a stone somewhere. I'd better be getting out there. I'd hate to miss him. Good hunting. Hospital? I wondered, have you had a .. An accident case in tonight called "Lyncort"? Major Peter Lyncort. It is Mrs Lyncort speaking. Hard luck, chum. Maybe he'll be on the next. The next one is not until after eleven. He won't be on that. General Hospital. "I wonder, have you had an accident case in?" "Called Lyncort." "It is Mrs Lyncort speaking." "No, I don't recall anyone of that name being admitted Mrs Lyncort." Thank you very much. "Wait a minute. Lyncort?" A Major Lyncort did come in about eleven o'clock last night. To borrow an electric stethoscope. I believe it was do with the explosives train down the line at Felsworth. Where? - "Felsworth." "We've been swamped with invalid evacuees from the district ever since." Sir .. sir! We got him! We got the blighter at Portsmouth. A message has just come through on shortwave. It's almost six. Too late to be useful. - May as well get him here all the same. Tell them to get him here as quickly as it's possible. It's desperately urgent. He's on his way, sir. I took the responsibility on my own. The Navy is bringing him in. Reed, that is wonderful. I love you like my mother. Now get away from this filthy train. Aye-aye, sir. Do we go on? Surely he wouldn't have timed it to go off just as the train arrived. Wouldn't he give it half an hour to get right into the dockyard? Probably. These chemical time fuses are never accurate. They vary with atmospheric pressure and temperature. As much as half an hour? Sometimes more. I tell you what we'll do. Split the difference, huh. Work another fifteen minutes. Thanks. Good work, Baron. - Thanks, Reed. The car is over there. I think I have found something. Don't move it. It's a wire or something. Here, give it to me. Easy, easy. Alright, there is nothing more you can do now. Get away from here. Did you hear what I said? Get away from here. What was it? - Here it is. It's a copper tube with a glass container of acid right here. When that tube breaks the acid eats into copper wire that's attached to a spring. See, I got a nail in here to keep it from working. The spring has a striker on it. The striker hits the detonator. Up she goes. Yes, simple. Too simple. It could have been made in any workshop. Well. That's that, huh. It's a pity the saboteur didn't get here before we found it. We could have got some information out of him. He doesn't have to know we've found it. If he sees me still looking for it when he gets here. I was hoping you would suggest that. Thanks. Now will everybody please be quiet and listen to me. I have just been informed. That the train is no longer liable to blow up. Therefore, there is no more danger. So, I am very happy to tell you. That you may all return to your homes. Have you found anything? No. When is it timed to blow up? - I don't know what you talk about. You are lying. You know what you planted and when it will go off. Where is it? Stay there until you tell us where it is, who employed you to plant it .. And the names of your associates. Murder always was a fascist police method. It's not murder. Suicide. If you choose to live, wave your arms. We shall be watching from over there. Come on, let's get away from here. I've got you some sandwiches. Not very good I'm afraid but the best I can dig up at this time of the morning. Thanks. - Here's yours, sir. Thank you, Reed. - Careful, sir. It's hot. They are making some more tea. I'll go and fetch it for you. Some for you, Baron? - No thanks. I think he's getting worried, sir. He's yanking like mad at the chain. Yes, he ought to be getting worried. It's nearly seven. Of course, he may be a fanatic and not care if he blows himself up. Help! Help! Get me out of here! Help! He's waving, sir. He's giving up. He's waving at us. Aren't you coming? - No, I'll wait here. Well? - I'll talk. I promise I'll tell you anything. Take me away. Please take me away. It's past time. It'll go any minute. Take me away! Please take me away! Alright, talk. Not here, not here I tell you. It will go any minute, it will go any second! I set delays for seven o'clock. Delays? More than one? Yes, more than one. I set two. One at the top, one at the bottom of the mine. Do you want to die? For mercy's sake, take me away! There is something wrong, sir. They are running for it. Go back, go back! There is a second charge in the same mine. Run for it! Come back, Lyncort! Don't be a fool. There is no time. Peter! Peter .. Peter. Get away from here. Run, please! - No. You all finished now, mate? Can I have a go? What was that? If you are through, can I have a go? Through with what? - With climbing on this train. You're not the only one you know. It a?n't just your train. Fine, you go r?ght ahead. You help yourself. It's all yours. Thank you. I like trains. I like trains. I like trains. t-g ?
