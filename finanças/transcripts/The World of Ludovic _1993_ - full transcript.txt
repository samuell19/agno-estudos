The World of Ludovic My name is Ludovic Maris... ...and I'm afraid of nothing. Excuse me... I... I thought... that... Hello, darling. I'm closing early. The shop is very quiet. I'm going to pick up Dad and we're going to eat with Henri and Theo. I know you can manage very well by yourself. Call at the slightest problem. Kisses. Mom. Message from Marc for Ludovic: Unexpected meeting tonight. Already tried the new video game, just for fun. I'll explain more later. Sorry, good night. Marc. - Turn off the music! - Hum? Aren't you tired of it, yet? No! - On the contrary, it stimulates me. - Really? I should never have remarried, and especially not to a Frenchman. What's he doing? - Here! - Thanks Maris. Well, this is for you. - Do you live far from here? - No, no. It'll be okay. Well, if you say so. Safe trip. Bye! This will cause flat tires. We have to pick up everything. Don't worry about that! Would you? - Was it expensive? - Idiot! It's all your fault! At least you're not hurt. You're joking! Would it annoy you to help me? If that's an order, I'd better obey. Who said it was? You see, you cut yourself. You'd better get home. I don't want to. Plus, it wouldn't matter, my parents are at work. At work? On Saturday? So what? Then come home with me. - What's your name? - Sophie, and yours? Ludovic. All this came from Barengo. I was born there, so believe me. Barengo is in Kenya. In Kenya there are many waterfalls and volcanoes. - Really? - Yes. And what's that? It's a drum. If you strike the drum as night falls... a very special bat appears... and you speak the name of who you want to see dead. Understand? You can get rid of whoever you want? Yeah! My mother is giving piano lessons! Really? We can look in. But don't make a sound. Ludo, darling. I have a meeting with a sales representative... If I'm not at home before 7 p.m., you have something to heat up in the oven. It'll be delicious. You'll see. Remember to do your homework. At the slightest problem do not hesitate to call. Kisses. Mom. Mom's order: We three are sharing a family evening at home tonight. I've borrowed a cassette. I'll also use the time to replace the mirror in the hall. The first to get up... Message from Marc for Brigitte: I hope you have no plans for tonight. We must be there at 7 p.m. They will look for me... Message for Ludovic: Sorry. Kisses. Marc. - Brigitte? - Yes I'm coming. Ah, Ludovic, you're here! Tell me you're not angry we're going? No. Good... Well, we'll do something fun tomorrow. What are planning to do with your evening, my dear? I brought you some delicious pastries. - I'm going to Barengo. - Good idea. Where? I didn't hear! Oh, nothing, to Kenya. Ah! That's a movie with Sylvester Stallone. Isn't it? No! It's not a film! Ah! Running late. - Wait - almost finished! - Ludovic! Go open! Hello, Ludovicus! Your Mom and Dad are expecting us. "I knew at once it was you, he said." Ludovic Maris is unavailable for the evening. He has headed off to Barengo. and he may never return. Good evening my darling! Come kiss me, little man! And voila! We're all together! - Come inside, Sophie. - It'll be bedtime soon. Ludo? Look! It is a room. So many secrets of life... Oh. That's Ludo's bedroom. Don't disturb him. Sorry, darling, sorry. Have you had a good night at least? ...sleep well sweetheart. I know it's regrettable, but I'll be leaving tomorrow evening. But the day will be ours. Huh? Okay, sleep well. Maris! You with us? What you dreaming about now, Maris? Mind your own business! I think he's thinking he'd like to pee in the girls' toilets. We saw you looking at her, but with such a small willy... you got nothing in the pants! Well, leave me be! Move! Leave me alone! Stop sticking to me, okay? Wait! I want you to stop following me! But I'm not following you! I would like to learn the piano... with your mother. Here is a DO. It's near the lock so it's easy to find... Your fingers should bend... and raise the other hand a key. Ah yes, I forgot your sore hand. That doesn't help. You can't use it at all. I think it will heal quickly. Well, yes. That music that you played Saturday. I'd like to learn to play it. Sophie will teach you the basics, okay? I'll check back later. Who was that boy? That's Joel, my little brother. Well, he seems really strange. If you say so. So... that's the basics. But don't expect further lessons. Very well. It'll be better if I take off the bandage. Is it healed yet? You know, if you kiss it it heals very quickly. I'm in no hurry to catch a disease. There's no danger. I am willing to teach you to dance... but not the piano. In late October there's a Grand Opera Festival in Paris. We could go there, right? Did you hear? Maybe... We'll see. Then you will stay during the holidays? A trip to Paris would do us good, eh? He eats nothing. Again! No! "He eats nothing once again, he doesn't like spinach..." "...he has no desire for it in any way!" "Plus he's not hungry!" Why do I wonder what I'm doing here? What did he say? What's going on in your head, my precious? I've become a little vagabond. You have not reached Ludovic Maris at present. "I am otherwise engaged." I'm gone! Message for Marc: Sorry! Well, well, me too. No sorry, Henri. Can't go out tonight. What? Ah! No, no! Not a problem with work. The software is selling like hotcakes. No, it's Brigette. Concerned about Ludovic. Hey, you can come by this evening. We'll spend the evening together. Okay... Hey, hey, tell Theo to come too, eh? Did you like "Jazz Dancing for Young Girls?" Yeah! They're just too good, no? Where are you taking me? You're curious. You must tell me! Follow me. No. I have to get back soon. Wait! We're in great danger! Hurry! You come here often? No. Only for special occasions. - Sophie. - Yes? I... I thought your father... looked like a Frankenstein, when he got out of the taxi. - You were there then? - Yes. What's the matter with you? That's completely stupid! Bof! They do it all the time in movies and books. Exactly! What does he do? Oh, he drills holes in the ground. Gravedigger! No! For ore. He's very talented. We lived a long time in Barengo. Today he travels constantly in Poland, Romania... He flies in and he's barely here before he flies out again. In Romania? Large families of vampires come from there. I think you're crazy! A vampire... is a very special bat. Understand? I understand that you're still a little boy, obviously. He disappeared. How? Oh? I don't know... But it's not that bad. I too used to take off at that age. But Brigitte is very, very worried. I'd like to come to your home more often. For piano, of course! Also to watch over you before something happens to you. I don't understand what you mean! There's something wrong! Your brother and your father are... My brother and my father? Yes, they are very strange. Be careful! Must go home! Ludovic! Where were you? Answer! Where have you been, my darling? I was with my friend John... No, no... I... Ah! Anyway! Our vagabond. Ah! Ludovic. Ludovic, uh... we were worried your mother and me... What happened? Oh! What is this? This... is a gift... that Theo and Henry gave me. Yes, "The Taking of Ludovic." Ludovic? Where are you going? Leave him. He went to see a friend, that's all. Yes, I was like that at his age. I called Grandma and Grandpa. They are delighted that you can come and see them for a week. So you can spend a week in Paris? I need a change of scenery. To rest. Nothing new about that! It's ok, you'll go to the sea. You'll go to the sea! You prefer to be alone for the week? Well then. A little brother or sister. Would you like that? I already have a new Dad. She is damn cute! She's got you whipped! Right? It's your boyfriend, Sophie! Go Sophie, go! Ludo, go! Go! Go Sophie! Join me! You stupid, stupid, imbecile! I never want to show my face in school again! Maris! Maris! Maris! You answer, Sophie. Mom is upstairs. Ludo? Sophie? But what are you doing here? It was I who brought you out! How? It's easy. You must have a very, very strong desire. Is that true? Yes. It's full of snakes! Come! When I heard you play that ridiculous instrument, I knew you needed help. You felt sorry for me? Women like men who need their pity. Didn't you know? Men love women who are stupid. Oh really? But I'm an exception! - You have to be frozen? - Yes. It is more realistic. - The story is very disturbing. - I don't know. Do you enjoy frightening me? No. There's plenty of people around who'll see you. So what? - But what are we going to do... - Shh! Wait. Shut it! What will we do? Get warm under the blanket. - What... - Don't worry. Quiet. One minute! Relax on your back like in a solarium. Like a what? I know what I do to relax, you know. I wonder how girls always know what we think about things. I'm going to be light-headed. I've never experienced anything so beautiful in my life! Because there is nothing so beautiful. I heard the door! But who is it? My father! Sophie? I thought I heard you talking. Really? - I had a nightmare. - Yes. I arranged things so I could come back sooner. Giving my instructions over the phone. Look what I brought. - It comes from Poland. - Super! Thank you. - Not wearing a nightdress? - No. You are growing so fast. Soon you won't receive your father like that. - It's so hot. - Good. Go, sleep well My God! What's the meaning of this? Chantal! Chantal! Where are you anyway! Run! Please! You there! Don't move! You either! Get out! Hurry! What's going on here! What's he doing in this house! Come back here! Stop right there! No! Don't hurt him! Don't you realize what this means, Chantal? How old is she exactly? - But say something! React! - Let the girl be until morning! Well, uh... I.. it's not the end of the world. I too, when I was little, I climbed on the roof... I hid. That was at his age. No, no, he's not in crisis. No crisis at all. Marc, it's just shy of 2 a.m. Uh, it's late, it's true... - You know what you... - Shh! If you scream I'm leaving! You know what's wrong with you? You've been disturbed for years... The children sense that, and they take advantage... You are nothing to the children. You're never home. That's why you feel guilty! And why you're acting like a caveman! Listen, listen, I am quite prepared to take care... Then take care of her! She collapsed! No. That would be stupid! Thank you. What... What have you done tonight, Ludovic? Oh yeah, the story of a cannibal. He has just captured an explorer... and he put in a large pot... and he says "What is your last wish?" The explorer tastes the water and says he needs a dash of salt. Hey, hey, that's very funny. I too have something funny. I can give it to him now, right? - Ah yes, why not? - What? What? A little patience. If you were not my beloved son, I'd really think that you were deceiving me. You can take it to the sea with grandpa and grandma. That would be nice, right? Wish I could stay with you. I'll miss you. You too, only my parents are afraid that I am pregnant. That you're what? I see you don't even know the word! He was going back to Poland, but he's staying... to keep an eye on me. I lost the present he brought. No! I have it! But how do you have it? You gave it to me under the bed. Well, You can hang on to it. I told father I threw it in the garbage - Looks like the net is tightening. - Yes. Yes. I have lost all my girlfriends. Yes, but I'm here. - Hey, Ludo? - What? Trade jackets with me. Ok! Ah, I find him strange. Kids are always happy to go to the sea, no? He's different. Different? - They should be posted. - I don't have a stamp. You ask when you buy them. Yeah, but I didn't buy them. I stole them. Oh? There are other ways to send someone your thoughts. I suppose. Would you like to write your Dad and Mom in Paris? Why? They don't write to me! Last time, you wouldn't leave the beach for one moment. It's too cold, and the sea is dirty. I wouldn't even wade in it. Nobody knows where I've gone. Don't know if I'll ever go back. - So your parents know nothing? - No. Go! Come. Has your father recently had a stomach ache? How did you know that? Yes. Appendicitis, he said. You fight some people with their own weapons! How so? Look at this. - Super! - It's the gift from a lady. She takes pictures. She said they're artistic photos. I want one! And one together, you and me! What did you want? - To keep her prisoner? - What are you talking about? - I would like her to obey. - Well, your wish is granted. She's gone. She is miserable. We are all miserable. You can't raise a child by giving them 5 minutes every 15 days. Oh, please, stop the music! - I'll call his parents! - They are away on a trip. He's with his grandparents on the seashore. She must be there. Shall we go there and look for her? I have the address. What's wrong? There is something serious happening with Ludovic. - What? - I don't know what! We have to go back now! Right now? The Nautilus! It's where Captain Nemo lived. Follow me! We could live here. We're in an unfamiliar country. It's cold here. Brussels: The King's Commissioner of police have asked us to give out the following information: Ludovic Maris aged 12 left November 6... How long? Two days. Two days? ...we were told again that may be with Sophie Pollaert... who left her home November 7 and lives... Sophie is also aged 12 and able... She is wearing pants... ...people who could provide information are urged... Hello, sir. - Seen either of these children? - No. Search of Tivoli found nothing. Investigations are continuing. So many streets to search, Why are they looking here? - I can't steal! - We have to if we want to eat. Once upon a time, indeed for a long time, in the heart of Riante Spain, A monk had fallen in love with a girl. She loved him also. So she disguised herself as a man... and entered the monastery. Not one of those places where you never talk? Yes. They could never say what they meant to each other. Who's there? Who's there? Hello, young man. I don't suppose you know how to find your sister? Really? Tell me then. I found this piece of a mirror in her room. And I kept it! And if I think on it very hard it may show me where she is. Do I have your permission? Yes. You find her. Ludo! Come on! Come, you can't stay here! I'll cry for help! No! Don't do that! Help me Ludo, climb! Go! Climb! I beg you Ludo! We need to go to Nautilus. Follow me Ludo! We must find food! We must leave now! Come! Look around if you want. You're not afraid? You'll won't go, eh? Of course not. Are you still hungry? I don't think about it. You're so sweet, so sweet. Yes. Call off the search. The children have been located. Where is Joel? Ludo, you must eat. Ludovic, you heard what your mother told you. You must eat. Leave him in peace for a while. But how do you know... he should be left alone? He must eat. He must be hungry. He needs a bath, he smells bad. - Yes Marc... let's drop it. - Really?... very well. - Listen... - Ah, you, I beg you... - You have to take charge. - That's right, of course, of course! Come on, first you are going to take a good shower. Come my boy, I can't have a dirty child at the table. - Maybe you could stay a week? - Out of the question. Everything must get back to normal. We are with parents who hate us. Say something. Open your mouth, Ludo. Marc. I can't do more. We need someone to help us or... What can they learn there? Ah, I don't know. It's a psychologist... I'm very surprised... Ludo has not opened his mouth since returning, and... - What happened to him? - I don't know. - An ice cube? - No thank you. Maybe I should make coffee? Maybe. It all started when he burned the CD in the toaster. Theo. You're talking nonsense. Ah! This music is pathetic! Your little boy is very charming. And I would really like to take charge of his care. Ludo is not living at home. - Where is he then? - He's gone. But where? Sophie, listen, I promise to call you soon as he is allowed visitors. Agreed? - Why's he so quiet? - I don't know. Ludie. - "You never talk." - "Anything you say betrays yourself." - That was in Terminator II? - Terminator I! I gotta take you in hand, Ludovic. You've been a very serious boy, I think. A very good student at school. It is this child that I must find again. We shall see each other three times a week. Sessions last one hour. How you use this time is up to you. We'll talk about your father, your mother... You'll receive medication. Tell me, is Madame Vandarmen your real name? I hate for you to ask stupid questions, my dear. - What is the capital of Suriname? - Paramaribo. Excellent! Oh, it was just a test to see if everything was well. Sit down, now. Sit down, Ludovic! Did you reopen it on purpose? The door is locked! Not really. The only locked doors are the gates. Or more accurately, the doors to the outside. - This is... - Yes, I know. It's a prison. You know we love you very much Sophie. No! Yes, we do love you. And you must not forget it. It's better than nothing. Well, well, well, well... uh... Ludovico,... we'll be going now. Ludo, we'll be back tomorrow. I'll never go home. Where is he? Yes, I mean Ludovic! You know where! I'm in the middle of a lesson. Anyway, it's better you don't know. But I WANT to know! Sophie! That is not true. I'm in a full lesson. You can wait. If I have to take off again, I will. No! I didn't say that. But leave the room. Go! This is the address and a phone number. You're sweet, thank you. 3, 4, 1, 2. This is against the rules, you know. Go on! Better be quick about it! Sophie! Where are you? Where are you? - "...I want to see you." - How is it there? Oh, okay, except they fill me up with drugs. Better if you come away. I can't, I am a prisoner. Everything is surrounded by electrified barbed wire. And there are guards! You're still delirious! No, it's the truth! And I can never leave. You know, I love you Ludo! Someone's coming. They're very close now. Yes, only a few meters. - Centimeters. - Ludo? She can visit you afternoons... But not too often. Huh? In one week, ok? Whoever she is... she is not the cure for your illness. We don't ignore that the outside world exists... But some children who come here have been damaged severely... by their parents, even loving parents, or by lovers... that's why they are here... and why we must enforce rules about phone calls. But you can call your parents whenever you want. Could you remove the mask? Ok, let's go. Tell us. It's your turn. We are in a cave full of meridian. Help, I... I... I can't breathe! Look out! Here come's the big Protopolaris! Without the comics, there's not much to it. I can see that. Sometimes comic artists are more gifted than those of the avant-garde. What do you think? About Ludo, he has the right to know. No! - Do you think we should tell him? - Yes. Mrs. Pollaert. Darling... My darling. Room 505-8. Ludo! You did miss me! - It's beautiful Ludo! - But why are you here? You said you were a prisoner. You seemed so sad. So your wrists? Yes. Oh no! How you could do...? Oh, don't... Hello Mother, Hello Father. This time I'm not hiding under the bed, sir! How long do you have to stay? Until I get better. Until I stop seeing things that aren't real. But me, you see me here now? Yeah, truly, yeah. It should really stimulate you. Hey, do you see the red dinosaur there? Oh yeah, you're right! Too bad... You're still crazy! Oh you! You'll see! Wait! Besides, the doctor said you wouldn't cure me. - Well, she's crazy! - She's completely twisted... - She says I am unique! - You see, you're not clear! You know what she looks like, your psychiatrist? No, go ahead, tell me. She reminds me of an enormous Protopolaris. Oh yeah, enormous Protopolaris! Adapted to English by Bill Davis
