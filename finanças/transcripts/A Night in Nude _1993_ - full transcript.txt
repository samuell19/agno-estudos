- 100 million in life insurance! - Who? Who said that?! Your fucking mother! When did you set it up?! Tell me, fuck you! Mom, help! Ren! Ren! - You fucking bitch! - Ren! What are you doing?! How about it, eh? One last fuck before I kill you? No! But I can't be bothered... Cut that out! Don't fight it! I'll fucking kill you! What's going on in there?! What the...? What is this?! Sorry, we're closed He's dead. It's your fault, Mom. He figured it out. So now what? The duomo? This doesn't bother you two? The stench! And the stickiness! Whoa, mom! Close the window! What are you thinking? You'll stink up the whole town! Letting them ripen up in the duomo is the best all around. All that effort, and not a cent to show for it. I hope you learned something, Ren! Ren, get that pot for me. Like it's my fault! You're the one with the big mouth... I had a year... Putting up with sucking his stinky cock! You're disgusting! A year, huh? The late Mr. Maeda should be pretty well decomposed by now. Let's check on him while we're there. If only we'd had a little longer, we could have sent him to the duomo as well. Give it a rest! I'll find another mark, OK? Ren! I know you?re home! It's your Daddy! Daddy?s here! What the?! Wait... I put a note on the door! How'd he get in? Huh? No one here? What about upstairs? Wait, mom! You're covered in blood! Here, wash it off! You stink too! Geez! Put this on, quickly! Just tell him you were in the bath. He's still got a key to the club! I... I'm in the bath! I'll be right out! Just wait there! He what?! And you've been divorced how long now?! I'll keep him downstairs. Ren, you hide! OK? You mustn't come out! Well, hello there! We're closed today, but how about a quick drink in the club? Ren's here, isn't she? I don't see her much these days. I wonder where she's wandered off to... - Come on, she's here, isn't she? - How did you get in? - Through the club, how do you think? - Let's go to the club, then. Come on. I can't believe it. Talk about timing! Grab me a towel. Here... How long is he going to keep plaguing us? - Daddy! Long time, no see! - Who are you? You must be getting senile! It's me, your daughter Momo! There's no blood of mine in you! So, you trying to collect on his insurance by killing him with booze? Fat chance! Murder won't rid you of this one, right? Can't argue with that! Ha, ha! He must be doing well, to be running around with a young one like that. He runs a 'lolita' joint in Kabukicho. Ren, you ran away from him, right? Funny how the guy I want to kill the most is always so full of life. You won't get a cent from killing that bastard. That girl... Saki, is it? She's on his insurance. He said she was some businesswoman, but you can tell she's just his whore. So he didn't say anything to you? Ren's his daughter, so you'd expect it would be her. No ambition, that one. Don't know who she gets that from. You can say that again. This isn't the way to the duomo! You sure we're not lost, Ren? Didn't you take photos of landmarks that time? I forgot the camera. I can't go any further. There?ll do. We'll never make it to the duomo. Watch out! It's high up, plus it's a cliff... Let's dump him here. The snakes and wolves will get him either way. Fine. OK, OK... OK. There. - live opened it, here we go. - That stinks! It's open. OK! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Out with the bad! - In with the good! - Nice! - Out with the bad! - Out with the bad! - Out with the bad! Out with the bad! - In with the good! Out with the bad! I can't find it! I know he had it on! I put it in the pot! It must've got mixed in with the mince. You know that cost me a fortune, right?! It was going to be mine when he croaked! It's not like she did it on purpose. She was tired! No, it's my fault. I'm sorry, I'll find it. You'll never find it. How are you going to get there? You can't even drive! If some hiker finds it, they'll trace the serial number back to us! You're a damn jinx! I promise I'll find it! Please forgive me! Forgive me! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

Written and directed by Takashi Ishii Written and directed by Takashi Ishii Slowly face this way. Written and directed by Takashi Ishii Written and directed by Takashi Ishii - Huh? Hey, wait a second! - Back off! Written and directed by Takashi Ishii - Huh? Hey, wait a second! - Back off! - Hey! Stop! - Ow! I said, stop! Anzai! Who the hell are you?! He says he's a handyman... Calls himself Jiro Kurenai... I was making an estimate, to see what size truck I'd need... At this time of night? J-I-R-O-K-U-R-E-N-A-I. That's right. The name on his license is Tetsuro Muraki. License number 307702863401. Born June 10th, 1957. Can you check it? This is Sumi, over. Yazaki just made the arrest. The guy confessed. Really? Ah... roger that. You hear that? They arrested the guy. Yazaki's unit caught him red-handed. He sang like a canary. - No way! - Yup. You hit the face too much, you know? It hurts. There had been a spate of burglaries... and you fitted the profile, so... - I'm alright now. - Thank you. If the courts and the media got hold of this, I'd be a goner... My lips are sealed. Have some coffee. Thanks, but the car's waiting for me downstairs... - But I've already poured it. - Yes, but I... well... Excuse me. Wait, you forgot this! A frigging bribe! Oh well... Give me a break... What now? - Excuse me... - I'd like to hire you for a job... Ah, of course. Hold on, I'll call you back later. - Please come in. Ah, no... - Was he upset? So, a lost cat or dog? Please... I want you to find a Rolex... A Rolex? It belonged to my father. Kinda romantic... spreading ashes from a helicopter. From what you told me, it should be around here... There's a tree here, so watch out. Careful! Are you all right? Like looking for a needle in a haystack... A Rolex in a forest... - Are you alright? - We won't find it today. It's Detective Anzai. How are your bruises? I dropped bu yesterday and today, but you were out... As if we'll find the damn thing! 'Sachiko Yamada'? Yeah, like that's her real name. Everbody's got something to hide. Ashes from a helicopter? What a bullshit story. The girl's got something to hide. Don't move! I'm coming! Stay still! Hold on! Are you OK? Did you twist anything? Looks painful... I only have water... I'm OK, it's just a scrape. I'll search by myself tomorrow. I won't steal it if I find it. Why won't you let it go? The case is closed. Why get involved? After all, handymen are all just... No need to talk like that. You've gotten rougher since your husband died. I know how you feel, but... I'm going to go lie down for a while. A search of old police records showed that Jiro had a record of his own... A 1-year suspended sentence for a firearms violation and suspicion of body-dumping. 17 years ago, a woman called Nami Tsuchiua had murdered a guy who... had raped her and then continued to extort money and sexual favours from her. She had planned for Jiro to take the fall after having him find the body, but... Jiro tracked her down, carrying the body around in a suitcase. Moved bu her sad history, he tried to save her... He reminded me of mu husband... trying to protect a girl from a stalker, only to... Aren't you going today? It's that time of the month. What are you doing?! Go that way. Stay away from me. Have some stew. Are you sure he won't steal it? You sure he won't figure it out when he finds human guts flung everywhere? This stew looks great. If he finds out, he finds out. The question is, do we kill him if he does? You can't just kill everyone. There's no need for a stabbing. We'll just wait for the body to age... Oh mom, not again? Please don't fight. I'll look for it again tomorrow. I'll get it back, and if he does get suspicious... Mom's stew is the best. She uses the bones of her victims for the stock. That was funny! Laugh, damn you! This is pointless. It wasn't here either... Damn, something stinks! Wait a minute... What the hell is this? There it is... Some cat had it in its mouth. Something felt wrong about it. I think it might be rat flesh. I want you to check it out for me. "Rat flesh..."? You're the only cop I know... Former Elite Securities Trader Risks Everything for Star-crossed Beauty Yes, Anzai here. Oh, yes. Sorry for the strange request... Huh? You've finished already? So it was from a rat? Volcanic ash unique to the Mt. Fuji area? What? Really? Yes... yes... So it was rat flesh! What a relief! I was worried it might be human. Where did you find the cat? The cat? Um, I mean, it's a very expensive watch... Ah, you want to find the owner? Well, yes... Truth is, I was asked to find it. It belonged to a client's father... It was dropped from a helicopter when the father's ashes were being scattered. I thought it was a lie at first, but then I found it. What's your client's name? Huh? Why do you ask? Can I come by again? - You don't need to, I'm all fine now. - But... - Ah... coffee? - Er, no, thank you. I'll drop by again. - See you later. - Er, I owe you for the lab work... Bye! Hello. I got your call. I guess you couldn't find it, right? Please come in. She was pretty... That woman. Is she your wife? She's a client. Needs her place cleaned. What's this? Oh well... Ta-DA! That's what you say at times like this, right? The watch... Check the serial number. Wow... this is it! Where was it? In the forest. It shone, as if it were calling to me. Calling to you? - My mother will be so happy! Thank you. - Your change... Goodbye. Well done. You're a good girl, Ren, finding it like that. Not bad, huh? I'll say this, the guy was honest. I tested him once, but he's very trusting. Oh, so you tested him... Bring him over sometime, The handyman... - Jiro Kurenai, handyman for hire. - We'll make him dinner. Is he single? Don't take out a life insurance policy on him. He's a good man. Hey, Ren, this is a little clean. Did you wash it? Why do you ask? It was mixed in with human guts. Well, he couldn't walk around with it all dirty, could he? He must have cleaned it. He is a handyman, after all. - It still stinks... - Of course it does, it was in with a dead body. Weren't you worrying about evidence? Would you prefer I hadn't found it? Kinda feels like we made money. There'll be lots of customers tonight. You've agreed to work, and you know the customers love you. Of course they do, because she always brings such good luck. I bet he'll come by tonight, that jerk. It's all right. I'll refuse point-blank. Welcome! - They're here. - Welcome! Now ladies and gentlemen! It's showtime! A mistake was born at that time, and I couldn't take it anymore. Pretending to be upperclass, so boring... such a bore. No more... Silk stockings are ruining me... Ah, embrace me, like a beast... Set mu naked heart on fire... - Wait, we're in the middle of a show. - Fuck off! Hey, Momo, what's going on? I'm sorry, he's drunk. Let's go to the bar. - That's it. We're all leaving. - See you again! - Let's go to one more bar... - Spread 'em. Ah, that's my girl. Come on, take it off. You're ruining my business! You should know about time and place at your age! So, where were you? What have you been up to? I'm helping mom here... Get back here! Stop it! Leave the poor girl alone! She says she's never going home. This is her home now! Stop talking shit, you old bitch! A father's come to see his little girl. What's wrong with that? You perverted old fucker! Is that any way to speak to your daddy? - There's no blood of yours in me! I'll fucking kill you! - You stupid cow! - That's it, Mr. Big Shot, time to go. - Knock it off! A mistake was born at that time... and I couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't... Couldn't... Couldn't... Couldn't... No... No, no... Just hang in there a little longer... Hang in there? Why not do it now? I told you! It's him. I can't do it on mu own. How can I kill him? How can I carry the body on mu own? Why are you hesitating? Just kill him and take him to the same spot as the others. You've already made up your mind, haven't you? Everyone is laughing behind your back. It would have been better if you hadn't been born. See... they?re laughing! They think you?re to blame! I know it! I know it all! That's why I'm doing it. Erase them, all of them! Erase them... Erase them... Yes, come in! Ah, shit... Oh, hello. I want you to find someone for me. Find someone? Have a seat. From 2007 to 2008, resident in Kabukicho, Shinjuku. Currently missing... - The person... - Ah, sorry. She saved my life. Will you look for her for me? All right. - Er, do you have a name for her? Tae? - She called herself Tae. She'd run away from home, but she wouldn't tell me why. I don't know if Tae's her real name... and I don't know her address or phone number either. What about a surname? After we parted ways, she'd call me sometimes. I've tried to remember what we talked about, but I can only remember bits and pieces. I haven't heard from her for a year or so, but I hoped you might be able to find her... I'm worried. She always seemed as if something was stalking her... I'll try. You don't have a cell phone, do you? That's right. Problems getting a contract... Take this. I'm not sure I'll know how to use it. - My real name is actually Ren Kato. - Excuse me, Er, how do I... Thanks. Hello? Hello, it's Anzai. - Don't worry, I have your phone right here. - OK. I might call you when I'm on patrol, I'll grab it off you if I'm nearby. Yes, so please take it with you when you go out... Thanks. Bye. Hey! - What are you sniffing around by yourself? - Sorry? The coroner said something about a Rolex with human tissue on it, and ash from Mt. Fuji. What's going on? Oh, that... You know that coroner does half-assed work, right? - So I'm testing him. - Testing him? I got some tissue from the lab, and added some ants and a soil sample... You're unbelievable! Tae... Tae, huh? "I have two phones, so feel free to use this one." "I'll put my number in it for you." "Ms. Tae..." "I owe her my life." "Please help me." Now I've got too many phones. Oh well, it's not like I have anything better to do... Tae... Tae... Tae... Tae... Tae... Tae... I think her father came and got her... Do you know where they went? - No, I'm sorry, I don't. - I see. Hey, Mr. Detective! Over here. You're looking for Tae, aren't you? Yes, do you know her? Follow me. - She was at a hostess bar. - A hostess bar? She was working there? Where is it? She's the girl who left home at 16, right? She lied about her age on her resume. So we had to fire her. But she needed a job, so I got her another. - At a hostess bar? A telephone dating club? - No, a telephone dating club. Which club is it? Where is it? I went to see her once, but she'd moved on to a hostess club. Then she quit that place... and got a job at a brothel, I think. A brothel? A brothel where? You keep asking where... I need the location... If you see her... Never mind... - I'm sorry, were you guys just friends, or... - We lived together. - Where is she? Akabane? - Maybe Akabane... I forget. So I'll try at the brothel tomorrow. Yes... A telephone dating club, a hostess club, then a brothel... She's had it rough, this Tae. Yes, it's fine. Your deposit will cover everything. Yes... yes. I'll make a thorough investigation tomorrow. We have to kill five more... or we'll never have enough to build the apartment complex. Hopefully some big shot will come along, on his last legs... Where the hell have you been?! I'm sick of getting hit because of you. Have you eaten? Have a seat. How short are we again? We need another 200 million. Would you-know-who's insurance be enough? Who? That pervert dad of yours? Didn't I tell you? Looks like he changed his mind. You're joking! Our names are on this! Where did you get it?! Hey! It hasn't got his seal on it! It's worthless! But it's his handwriting. I searched his place while he was out. It's dated half a year ago, see? Is a thumbprint enough for a will? I steal this so we can live happily ever after, and you're still angry at me? What am I to you? You two kill for your own gain... you make me help you... I even found the Rolex... Do you know how hard stealing this was for me? If he finds out, he'll beat me, or worse! I'm sorry. I've always been on your side, you know? His seal would be best. Let's get him to bring it. We'll say we'll sell this place to him, and get him to put his seal on the deed. He'll be here in a flash! He's always wanted this place. We'll get him drunk, then wring his neck! Get his seal, then wait for his body to age? If you'd told me that before, we could have killed him years ago! Let's drink a toast! A toast, a toast! Cheers! Ah, you're a good girl! Such a good, good girl! I'm so happy I had you! Do all fathers want to fuck their daughters? I can't understand that shit... Fathers and daughters? What do you mean? Here. I think his name was Okami, or something... Ogami? His wife found out and they divorced, but he kept following the girl. After awhile, she wanted to kill him. Happens all the time. Of the girls that work for me, I must know 30 like that. And after that? The worst thing was, he made sex videos of them together. He sold them. What kind of a parent would do such a thing? Would it be possible to see that video? What for? I need to find out what she looks like. She was a kid when it was made. Her face would be different now. Is there a park in Kabukicho? - I guess so. - She was hooking there. Hooking? Near a park? One of our customers said he dealt with a pimp there, and the girl that came looked like her. He said it was definitely her. When was this? Kabukicho Park is gone now, and they're even pulling down Koma Theatre. The whole area's being redeveloped, so a lot can disappear in 10 years. Sorry? Lolita? Hello? Good evening. I've got all these e-mail addresses from young girls wanting 'dates'. Would you like to try one? Come on, how about it? Wait, do you know... Do you know a girl called Tae? - Tae? - Yes. I've been asked to find her. Who the hell are you? I'm asking you who the fuck you are! Get back here! - Hey, what is this? No, wait... - Let's have a chat. Hey, let go! What gang are you from, huh? What about Tae, then, motherfucker?! Don't fuck with our girls, cocksucker! Get the fuck back here! Where the fuck is Tae, huh?! You know where she is, don't you?! I'll fucking kill you! Fucking bitch! It's me... I've got two more for you, so give them the piston treatment, high-speed. Ha ha ha, that's right! Thanks, baby. Fucking bitch! Hey, you scared the shit out of me. Don't surprise me like that... Tae, honey. So even you get surprised? Where've you been these last six months? Speak of the devil, and there he is! Where's Tae, where's Tae? Every asshole wants to know... What's with the gloves? It's the latest craze. Hey, how did you find out my mother's address? Oh, so you got our bill? We can't have you taking the piss. You're our best earner, so you're getting off lightly. Other girls who run off end up in a steel drum in Tokyo Bay. So you're saying I can never quit? You see, you shouldn't go to such extremes all the time. Use us when you need money, save up enough and it's sayonara? The world doesn't work like that. You little shit! I've got a line of 30 johns waiting for you... You can start today, right, Tae? How about right now? A stun-gun?! Fucking stop! Ow! The cell phone! I dropped it! Shit, have I dropped it?! Goddammit! Good, good... A mistake was born at that time,... and I couldn't take it anymore. Pretending to be upperclass... so boring... such a bore... You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! Why is this happening to me? Why? Why is this happening to me? You've got to be joking. It's happening again. I've been set up again. Was it her? That kid? Hello? Hello, Jiro? I... I thought I might be hearing from you right about now... It was you, wasn't it?! Yeah, it was you. You set me up, didn't you? - Jiro? - Your pimp's dead. Pimp? Is everything OK? Don't fuck around with me! - Where are you watching this from? - Watching? - Wherever I go, always calling me... - Jiro! - What are you trying to do? What do you want? - What do you mean? Just hold on a second... What happened?! I was calling you, but you didn't answer. I was worried something had happened. - When? - Around 8pm. It just rang and rang, but you didn't answer. - That was when I had dropped my phone. - What? You're using my phone, aren't you? I'm sorry... I'm a bit jumpy... - Someone's died, you see. - Someone died? Was it Tae?! No, don't worry. It's nobody important. If it's dangerous, please stop. If anything happens to you... Actually, please stop. I'm fine. I'll try somewhere else. This is it... Excuse me... Sir, you can't just walk in. You have to register online. I'm looking for a girl called Tae. Tae? What about her?! Ken! He's a customer. Watch how you speak to him. I'm sorry, Sir. So... - you mentioned Tae just now... - Yes. Do you know her? - Do you know where she is now? - No, I know nothing about her. She left home at 16, then worked at a printing factory, then an auto plant... Then hostess clubs and brothels. After that, she started hooking in front of Kabukicho Park. Who asked you to look for her? That's confidential, but I can tell you I am looking for her. Your client... is an innocent-looking young girl, with large breasts, hair about this long, 160cm tall, and about 40 kilos... am I right? Tae's right here. Tell her I'll be along later. Say hello to Ren for me. Ren? Ayumi Who is it? Tonight is members only. It's the handyman. Ren hired me. Ren's busy now. Can you wait outside? Hey... It's the handyman. The handyman? This is a private area, Mr. handyman. You're Tae, aren't you? Please don't disturb our customers. Sorry. Mr. Handyman... We were just talking about you... We have to thank you for the Rolex. Why don't you sit down? No thanks... I'm still working. Er, I... borrowed this from Ren. I thought I'd return it. I'll write a report once I get back to my office. I'll send it to you, along with my bill. Is that OK with you? I'll be on my way then. Did everyone... say bad things about me? About how far I've fallen, and how I'll sleep with anyone, even my father. They all said... you were like an angel. The type of girl... who made everyone smile. They wondered... how you'd been doing. What was that?! What the fuck was that?! What the hell? What's wrong with that kid? Who the hell is Tae?! "Just like an angel..." What a bullshitter I am! On her knees since she was 16! She's a common slut! I can't work women out... Even young girls, I can't understand them! Shut up! Fucking shut up! - Hello? - You finally picked up! There's something I didn't tell you... Can I ask you more about your client, and where you found the watch? I'm sorry... I was out working. What's this? Manager Obara... from the brothel... That guy I just met? Sorry, just talking to myself. Hello? A crime? "Captured on Video... "Budding Young Maiden." What? Human tissue? Not rat, but human? Human tissue? Shit... Yes. Understood. I think I might know something, and I'd be happy to help you any way I can. Yes. I have your phone on me 24/7. I could come and see you tomorrow... That'd be fine. Thank you. See you then. Goodbye. Something happen? A pimp was murdered in Shinjuku. It was on our beat. Look him up. I've been set up... Perfectly set up. Killing a pimp... to erase her past? Will she kill as many as it takes? And finally me as well? That wouldn't do at all. Kids shouldn't mess with grown-ups. I'll blow it open. Blow her whole scam wide open! How disgusting... - Daddy, that hurts. - It hurts? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Daddy, it hurts... Stop, it hurts... Daddy loves you the most... OK, I'll do it for you... - Really? Thank you, Ren. - Ren? "I'll do it for you..." That's that guy! Why?s the door locked? Open up. Daddy, open up. That's vile! That's fucking vile! What is this?! I'll do it for you... They got divorced when the mother found out... but apparently he kept chasing her. Followed her obsessively... Tae was her name. It got so bad she wanted to kill him. What's more... what's even worse is... he made videos of them... and sold a whole bunch of them... in Shinjuku and Ikebukuro. They sold like hotcakes! The customers were just as bad for buying, but... But really... how could he do that to his own daughter? And make money off it, too? That Tae's a dumb bitch as well... That's just what men and women do, I guess... Same shit happens everywhere... Best to put it out of your mind... It ain't gonna stop anytime soon. You're no good at this... Give me my fucking money back! What the hell are you doing?! What are you doing?! What?! What are you... What are you doing?! Who is it? What happened? I... have to apologize... Are you all right? Can you stand? Hold on to me! Are you OK? Watch your step. I thought ice might help. It's a little cold, but... - I'm sorry... - Don't worry about it. Are you sure you don't need to go to a hospital? My clothes... They're cold... Huh? You want to take them off? Ouch... Can you do it? - Let's get that off too. - It hurts. Your panties too. That's terrible... Who did this to you? Was it him? What? Ogami? Yamagami. That bastard! He's evil! To do that to his own daughter! So you know... I didn't want to, but I kinda stumbled across it... Did you see it? The video... I'm scared! I want to kill him... As long as he's around, I... Is that why you had me find him? No. I know where he is... No matter where I ran, he always found me and brought me back. I could have killed him if I wanted to. But I couldn't bring myself to... to kill someone. I needed someone who could understand. Understand what I went through, not just in words, but what I saw, what I felt. Me? If I had one person who understood, I felt I could go on. Jiro... - You were so kind. - No... No, I turned my back on you. He came to the bar after you did... then took me home and beat me. I finally escaped... This was the only place I could go... where I feel safe. I'm sorry. I didn't realize... I thought it was a trap, that you were trying to frame me. Frame you? No... You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you? Help me... Call me Ren. I will. I'm cold. You think I'm dirty. That's not true. It's not. You're pretty. Ren... We'll kill him... - We'll kill that man... - You're hurting me... Sorry. What should I do? How should I kill him? What are you talking about. You'll ruin yourself. I don't care, if it sets you free. Should we do it together? Make sure we don't get caught? No... I'll do it myself. No, we'll do it in order to live together. Together? Don't you want to? Yes... Yes... I'm the handyman Jiro Kurenai... and I will stake my life to protect you! It's too good to be true... Someone can actually disregard everything that's happened to me. Ren... Ren... I'm the superintendent for the building. The shower doesn?t have a curtain, but there is no one to see in. The same thing happened to both my mother and my sister. You mean the two girls at the club? You can sleep here. My family's abnormal, isn't it? He ruined everything. He... Yamagami... He was a salaryman, a regular customer at Mom's club. He fooled her with his sweet words... My mother was lonely; her husband had died. She had already had my older sister when she met my father. That man, on the outside, he's so friendly that no one believed me, but he was quick to hit me. He hit mom too... everyday. She protected me, even after she found out about us. She endured it for me and my sister. But, eventually she broke up with him. Then her new husband started hitting her too. They were all the same. Mom fought back for the first time, and he fell down the stairs, hit his head and died. The same thing happened to my sister. But that... could be seen as an accident, or maybe self defense. It's me, Anzai! Sorry, I was working late. Who is it? Maybe he's out. May as well wait... I think she's gone. So... we thought about what would happen if we went down for murder. We couldn't let that happen. So, we made it look like mom's husband had killed himself, but with my sister's husband, there was too much blood. Whose Rolex was it? What? There was human tissue... type-O blood, stuck to the watch. So you knew... How? There were maggots and ants all over it, - so I had a friend check it out. - A police officer? No, a university buddy. He works at a hospital. The watch was... my sister's. I'm sorry I lied. - See? I told you it'd turn on. - It's beautiful. Want a beer? Aren't you hungry? Do you know the forest near Mt. Fuji? It's a hotspot for suicides. Want to go? To kill ourselves? No, we could carry his body there and make it look like a suicide. There's a quarry from the Edo period deep in the forest. There are some abandoned underground caves there. Mom played there when she was a girl. They say many stonecutters may have died there a long time ago. Something lives there... Some kind of presence? You can sense it. It freaked everyone out, so the owner shut it down. My sister calls the place "the duomo." The duomo? She honeymooned in Italy. Every town has one, she said. No matter how small. It's a plaza in front of a church. You can hang the bodies by their necks from the walls, so it looks like suicide. Then you wait a year or two, until the body ages. What if the body is found before it's properly aged? No problem... the last guy has been there over a year and no one has found him. We'll drug him with sleeping pills... and hang him by his neck. Even if he's found, it'll look like he hanged himself. Be careful... you'll fall! Turkish Bath... Imperial... Bar Orion... I can't stand blood. So, it's the least messy way of doing it... The thought that his blood is flowing inside of me... makes me want to replace all the blood in my body. Will you promise me something? Promise this will be the last time... the first and last time you kill someone. I'll... I'll look after you. Let's go see my mother and sister. Then we'll all go together. Right now? All of us? This one? No, the pink chiffon one. How'd you get those cuts? That's good; that dress suits you. Perfect for a party. Jiro, come and join us. I've told them all about you. Come on... It's all right: I've told him everything. He still says he'll help us. You're after money, right? Shinjuku... Korea Town... You're quite the busy bee... So where is my Jiro today...? Your phone's ringing. It's not mine. Just ignore it. These noodles are delicious. The flavor takes me back... That's a nice thing to say, but facts are facts... so you are going to be wanting your share, right? No, I won't. I'm not interested in money. I've been there and done that. I trust this guy. He's got pretty eyes. I see... You want to know his hangouts, apart from the warehouse? Yeah, I thought you'd know. No, that's not what I meant. He looks a little like... the sketch of the suspect. Welcome! - Daddy! - Thanks for coming. We know you're busy. Why are you dressed up like a bunch of clowns? We're throwing you a party today! - Are you by yourself? - Yup, just me. What are you doing here? We haven't paid his finder's fee yet. Get him his usual, on the rocks. I've had too much already. Make it a beer. Beer it is then. Daddy! Geez, that's enough, you two! You two get on so well... Here, Daddy. There you go. Why's nobody drinking? - There's yours, Momo. - Thank you. And this is for Mom! Though I don't know what to... - Cheers! - Cheers! Whoa, that's bitter... Of course it is; it's beer. Why's nobody drinking? We have a business proposition for you. Listen, I'm not interested in a dump like this. But Ren said... No more business talk! Let' go out to eat. Hey, Daddy, is your insurance beneficiary... that, what's her name, Saki? Come on, Daddy, tell me. - Well, one thing's for sure, it ain't any of you. - What? Hey! You put something in my drink, didn't you? Listen, did you bring your seal? Never mind that. What did you put in this? Poison? Sleeping pills... You what? You bitch! Jiro! Stop! Stop! Stop! Just stop! Stop! Don't! The estimated time of death has to be in the forest! Get out of the way! Find his seal. It'll be pitch dark if we don't hurry. 'Kabukicho pimp murder suspect sketch' "Just after the assumed time of murder, "this man was seen fleeing the scene in Korea Town by several witnesses..." Korea Town! - No! - Open your mouth! Open up! No! No! Good, she's done. One, two, lift... It's heavy! Pull! You too, mom! - Damn it! - I can't see. Volcanic ash... particular to the Mt. Fuji area... How much farther? It won't be funny if we get lost again... Here it is! Mom, Momo, look! Just as it was a year ago! I've had enough of this. Why did we have to come all this way to make it look like suicide? We could have done it in the city and saved ourselves all this trouble. What?! It's a famous suicide spot. Let's go. Ah, that's right... Not easy saving money to build an apartment, is it? All right, here we go. Are you OK, mom? On three, OK? What the...? Hang in there... Hey, it's that way! Here! Hurry! Come on, damn it! Come on! This is too much! Come on! Come on! Mom! Mom! Great, isn't it? It's relaxing here. I feel cleansed. It was tough going... But tonight's the night we bid farewell to daddy! That dress is just perfect for the occasion. Huh? What? Danger! Do not enter Oh, a mummy... He hasn't aged enough yet... Hey... can you sense something here? - Something... - Yeah, something... How about we make daddy's grave here? By the underground lake? Yeah, it's bottomless. He wasn't skeletonized, he mummified! Yeah... Hurry... He was moving until now. - He's dead. - What's this? It's one of those bands they use to bundle flowers. Let's stop... Let's not do this. He'll listen to reason if we just apologize. Can you hear me? Hey! Tie the rope to him. Move the rocks... Hey, what... what are you doing?! What the hell?! Hurry! Now! Now! A little more... Do it properly! This fiend ruined our lives. Bye bye! You were a curse! All right! And now a prayer... Suicide Prohibited What a nice lovers' suicide... Momo, what's wrong? Is she all right? Let's stop this... Let's stop. Stop! Are you all right, Momo? It's tough... I don't know how you do it... Ren! If you can't handle it, I'll do it for you! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! - Stop! - Shut up! Die! Die! Your dress suits you too, Momo... A mistake was born at that time,.. And I couldn't take it any more. Pretending to be upperclass... so boring... such a bore... every day... Just perfect... Here we are together, sisters and friends. Ren! Ren! Hold your horses. Jiro's acting weird! Ren! Where's Momo? Ren! Ren! Where's Momo? She's resting. Did you get Daddy's thumbprint for the insurance? Ah, I forgot. Ah, before that, Jiro! Jiro! Jiro! Stop! Jiro, what are you doing? That stun gun's great. When did you get it? - The thumbprint... - Oh... When you've finished... make sure you wipe the ink off his thumb. Stop! Ow! Get off her! What?! What?! Momo! Momo! Ren's gone crazy! So you only loved Momo after all! I've written your fucking will too... I wrote both of them. I had nothing better to do when Daddy was having his way with me. Every day, all I'd do was practice his and your handwriting... Will you put your own thumbprint on it for me? I went through hell... It's your fault too! You knew what he was doing! You didn't want him to leave, so you looked the other way! Don't you see?! Hey... To tell the truth, I've hated you all this time! You stole him from me! You want to throw me off here? I won't fall, you know... You shouldn't have killed so many! You stupid bitch! Who the fuck did you take after?! I've only killed one. I'd only get 10 years. I'd still be in my prime when I got out! But you! How many have you killed? It'll be the gallows for you! If the body doesn't surface, what happens to the insurance? Never mind... Huh? The handyman's gone... Hey, handyman! He's gone... He's run away. Where the hell did you go? What are you crawling around for? Just give up! Go on, kill me. And yourself, too... Shall we die like dogs together? Don't be so stupid! My whole life's ahead of me! I can finally live in peace... with their insurance money. It's not right! It's not right! How long do you think I've waited? I've held out for this day. "Tae" means "to always endure." If you'd kept your mouth shut, I could have been nice to you. Let me go! All men deserve death! Do you remember that night? It was hard for me to deceive you, because my skin was unblemished... so I made those wounds myself, with a whip. You see? It was after you'd seen me in a compromising position... I did it to gain your sympathy! A mistake was born at that time... and I couldn't take it any more. Ren! I know you?re home! It's your Daddy! Daddy is here! Oh no... What should I do? Daddy, that hurts. It hurts! Oh, it hurts? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Daddy loves you the most... OK, I'll do it for you... Really? Thank you. You're a good girl. What do you like, Ren? I'll buy anything you want. Go away! I don't want to. Take them off... No! - Take them off... - No! No! No! Daddy, stop it! Stop it! I'll do anything! Daddy, just stop it! I'll do anything. That hurts! Don't hit me! Stop it! Get out of here! I told you to get out! That hurts! Out with the bad! Mom, please help me! Why... why won't you help me? It hurts! - In with the good! - Out with the bad! It hurts! I took them off... I took them off... It's too much to stand... A mistake was born at that time... Pretending to be upperclass... so boring... such a bore... every day. I can't take it anymore! The sun is going down. Save me. Did everyone... say bad things about me? About how far I've fallen, and how I'll sleep with anyone... Embrace me. Kiss me and shake mu heart... like a storm... I can't do it... I can't... No... No... No. Isn't it enough? Just hang in there a little longer. Hang in there? This hurts. Why not do it now? I told you! It's him... I can't do it on mu own. How can I kill him? And how can I carry the body on mu own? Why are you hesitating? We'll do it to live together. Just kill him and take the body to the usual spot. You've made up your mind to kill the other guy too, haven't you? Damn, you slap me over and over again! I come here alone when I become discouraged. Something lives here... When I become discouraged, it gives me strength and helps me. Something lives here... - It gives me strength and helps me. - Stick to the plan. - It tells me I can kill anyone... - Stick to the plan. In the way of Ren's Happiness, even if they?re your parents or your children. "He's evil! "He's doing it to his own daughter!", you said. I knew... If you were only going to kill Yamagami, you wouldn't... There'd be no need to come here. There'd be no point. You had to kill more people for the insurance money... Correct... Do it... until you're satisfied. It's all right, if it saves your soul... What?! Stop trying to be a hero! I wonder if it still works... A mistake was born at that time,... Police! Drop your weapon! Police? That fool... Drop it! Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon! I said, drop it! Now! Drop it! Let me go! Don't ruin my plan! You mustn't... You mustn't kill anymore... You idiot... I should have taken insurance out on you too. It's here! It's here! No bullets! Fuck! Hurry up and die! After you kill me, get out of here. Ren, you have to live... Shut up. Stop telling me what to do! It's here! It's here! Stay away! No! - Stay away from me! - Snap out of it! - No! - Pull yourself together! You devil! Don't shoot! Jiro... Don't die! Don't die! It's not your fault... Ren... you're an angel! Don't die! Don't die! Hello... The door was unlocked, so... I brought this... Please eat it if you feel like it. Hello... I'm coming in... You have to eat... I brought some more food... Please eat it, OK? Hello? I must be imagining things. How'd you get in? Hello... May I come in?
