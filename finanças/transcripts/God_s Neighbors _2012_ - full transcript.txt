"To the true believer faith is observation" Rabbi Nachman of Breslov The sixth day, Heaven and the earth were finished. And on the 7th day God completed His work and God rested the 7th day from all his work and God blessed the 7th day because He has rested from all His work. - With your permission. - Cheers. Blessed are You, who creates the fruit of the vine. Roy Assaf Gal Friedman Itzik Golan Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth. Rotem Zisman Cohen Haim Hova The rice. Give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy lasts forever. To Him that made great lights, for His mercy lasts forever. The sun to rule by day, for His mercy lasts forever. The moon and stars to rule by night for His mercy lasts forever. To Him who divided the Red Sea for His mercy lasts forever. And made Israel pass through it for His mercy lasts forever. But overthrew Pharaoh in the Red Sea for His mercy lasts forever. To Him that led His people to the desert, for His mercy lasts forever. To Him that smote great kings, for His mercy lasts forever. Hey, be quiet! Same story every Friday night! It's Friday night! We want to rest! A film by Meni Yaesh - Fill it! - To the top. - We'll all get married soon. - Let's drink. Here's the pain in the ass! - Look at his Armani skullcap. - Come drink with us. What do you want? Could you turn it down? It's Friday night. People are resting. So go home and rest. Go home and pray! I have something for you. I'll pump up the volume. They don't like loud music but throwing rocks is OK. - Bitches. - Aim for the one in the middle. Turn the music off! Turn it down! Down! You son of a bitch! Avi, careful! Avi! I'll kill you. If you ever come back, I'll kill you. Is that clear? Get up. Inside the car. Go! - Get the hell out of here! - Assholes! - Go! - Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch... Well done, boys! - Pricks, sons of bitches... - Yaniv, Kobi... Good night, dear neighbors. From now on it'll be quiet on Friday night. Shabbat Shalom. Avi, you nailed it, man! GOD'S NEIGHBORS Nachman from Uman Daughters of Israel Be prepared for the Messiah No despair in the world Thank you, give charity! Smile! Smile! Yaniv, you have a delivery. A kilo of cucumbers. Yes, Mrs. Hannah, of course. Today only. Look at this. Fix it up. Let's have some coffee later. Certificate of merit to Avi Bahar Nachman from Uman What's up? Be quiet, if you wake my dad up I'll kill you. Why are you shouting? What's up, fatso? I told you to be quiet. Yaniv, your head. Throw it to me. Kobi, come on! My dad is sleeping! He wants to play in Brazil's team. Have you finished Avner's song? Yes, I made him a killer track! This'll blow your skullcaps off. Blessed are You, Lord... - Roll a joint, Yaniv. - Right away. You're coming to the Rabbi's lesson? With God's help. But I have a ton of work tomorrow. So what? You have to come, it'll be fun! "Super tale..." "Super quote..." "I want to tell you something." Kobi, give me a lighter. Well, it's not finished yet, but this is the main idea. Listen. Hear O Israel Lord our God The Lord Is one Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good for His mercy lasts forever... It's killer, man! It's ace, man! It's great. Awesome! It's great but you forgot something. - What did I forget? - What? - Think! - What? You forgot to put some Shofar. You open the track with a... It continues with... - You gave me an idea. - You got us jumping. You gave me an idea. I'd also shorten the beginning. - Wait, let me open the file. - Go ahead. You can also let it fade in. How do you say "Shofar" in English? Shofarrr... - Hello. - Good morning. Do you have red onions? Come show this cutie where they are. Dad, they're over there. Aviko, come on... Here they are. Underneath, they're fresher. Thanks. Aren't you cold? Not at all. Take care of yourself. You could easily catch a cold. How much? 5 shekels. Anything else? No. Did you say something to her? No, nothing. One, two, three, four... - Don't pressure me. - You're slow. - So, Lugassi. - Yes. What's up with the kitty shit? It's a shitty job. It's tough... Ask him about the parrot. "Lugassi! Lugassi!" What a bird! David! David the King of Israel What, are you nuts? - What's up? - And you? Praise God, thanks for asking. Everything okay? David, come to the synagogue. You haven't been since Yom Kippur. I'll try, buddy, but I can't promise. Is that Kobi over there? Yeah... it's a tournament. Tell that fucker that nobody screens David. His brother phoned him from jail, but he didn't answer. - Kobi! - Forget it, he's... I'll tell him. Okay, buddy. Bye. Bye. Nice upholstery. - You like it? - Yes. Yeah. Next week... Avraham, remember Izho? - The one who played backgammon? - He used to say: "Come on, 6 and 4... 6 and 4" - What did you roll, Izho? - "2 and 1." He was saying it sadly: "2 and 1". It's sad. Man, I hate them. Those Ishmaelites, God help me, I hate them. One day they'll get such a beating... They only understand violence. Like that gang that taunted us on Yom Kippur. Avi, let's beat them up! Are you children? Leave them alone. Calm down. You're so dramatic. Elisha, let's put it this way: There's a higher force and there's an earthly force. He nailed it. It would make a great sticker! Our fate is happy. Our fate is comfortable. Our legacy is beautiful. Gentlemen and Gentlemen... I want to tell you something. The Bible says: "And these words with which I command you this day "shall be upon your heart." We must inquire: What do these commandments mean? Why are there so many commandments in the Bible? Is the Creator of the Universe some sort of military sergeant? What? Why all these commandments? In Hebrew, "commandment" comes from "camaraderie". Camaraderie! Connection, unity, pairing. "And these words with which I command thee" connect you, pair you and unify you with the blessed eternal light. These commandments will connect you to it. Avraham! What's this?... At least if you had a beard, you could play with it. - I'm working on it. - I bet you are. Does your silly brain really get that the leather strap you wrap around your left arm each morning connects you to the blessed eternal light of the Lord who is your real self? I don't get it. What does the Lord want? He wants the animal in us... to rise to a holy state. You don't get it, do you? It's a good thing. If you would, it won't be the real deal. Oz... "Strength and joy He shall give to His people." Tell me something, Oz, do you realize that you are unbelievably sweet? Do you realize? - Mommy's little boy... - Listen. Listen to me. Gentlemen, each day, this arm puts on Tefillin, not because the Tefillin... No, stop reasoning! It's not in the mind! It's in the heart. It says so in the holy Book of Zohar: "No thought can truly grasp God at all". Gentlemen, you think I know more than you do? Because I dress like this, I know more than you do? The hat is not all that. The jacket neither. Even a goat has a beard. Indeed! Just kidding, Rabbi. Gentlemen, listen up. If you think I know everything, then get out. Me... I don't know a thing! I don't know a thing... Okay, ladies, come on. Enough with the "super quote"... Now, let's... Let's move on to the... "super tale". Look who woke up, Rabbi. - Are you with us? - Yes. Yaniv, listen. You like this kind of tale. A tale that tells how we can use our silly brain to fool the evil inclination within us. The story begins with a Jew who returns home after a day's work. All his coins were in his pockets. In those days, you didn't have checks or credits cards. He had cash. Suddenly, a thug grabs him, points a gun at him and says: "Your money or your life." The poor guy thought to himself: "Why me?" "Why do I deserve this?" the Jewish man wondered. Give me the money! What? "Look, I can't give you the money just like that, "my wife knows me, "she'll think I lost it in gambling. "Come on, shoot my jacket. "Make holes in my jacket. "At least my wife won't kill me when I get home." Hurry up. The thug plays along. He shoots the jacket. The Jew sees that the thug is playing along. He says... - Let's do this right. - What do you want? - I'll take my hat off. - And? "Shoot my hat. Make holes in it. "When I get back, my wife will be happy, "she'll think it's a miracle I'm still alive!" Okay, make it snappy. Come on! - Come on! - You're driving me crazy. He ran out of bullets. The Jew realized that, gave him a head butt, kneed him. "Damn you!" - Can I ask you a question? - Shoot, bro. Seriously, what's the deal with the side curls? Avi Bahar, asking about side curls? Praise the Lord! I was just curious. How long have you been growing them? How long? 6 years. Since I flew to Uman. Really? By the way, are you flying to Uman? God willing. I want to be there. You must come, bro. You have to come with me. I know. I'll carry you and your luggage on my back. We will party. We'll barbecue, drink vodka, strengthen our faith. You must visit the Rabbi's grave on new year's eve, read the 10 Psalms, and give to charity to be acquitted on Judgment Day. God willing. The festivals in Uman are not like the festivals here. Really? There, it's a party of sanctity. 40,000 people shouting to the Lord. You come back from there... a happy and changed man. Besides... It's cool, bro. - Totally. - It helps a Jew talk to God. Talk to him, bro. Testing, testing... Come to Uman and you'll have curls. Leave it... He's just showing off. God, open my lips and my mouth will recite Your prayer. Blessed are You... I'll go with you to give to Avner your track. Not today. I'll go tomorrow. - Are you coming to Elisha's tonight? - Of course. I have to go the other way, to hop over to the store. I have to bring my dad something. See you tonight? See you. There might be a kitten trapped inside your engine. Be careful. Thanks and have a good day. Miri, the neighbor. 6 and 4 is good. This is the 6 and this is the 4. Your turn. Go on. Pal, it's not your day. Slowly by slowly, I'll make it. 6 and 3. Great... That's 6. 3 and 6 is very good. Your turn, Avi. Go on, buddy. Stick it to him! Oh, man! Yaniv, you killed me. Don't fight. Even if the famous Ibrahim Tatlisoglu Kogulo sat here, he'd lose to me. Without even looking, I know I got double 6! - Fuck, Yaakov. - I'm gonna trash you. Where's the modesty, Yaakov? You're so proud. How does the saying go? - "He humiliates the proud..." - Yes, Rabbi. "...and lifts the humiliated to the skies." - Listen during the lessons! - God forbid, guys. I'm not being proud. It's a fact. - 6 and 6! - Double 6! - Did you stick "6" on every side? - You're history. Look. 1, 2, 3, 4. Your day is over. Roll the dice. Drop it. You're a shame for the Turkish. You're weak. Bash the Turks all you like, but all the great Israelis are Turkish. - Did you know that? - Really? - No, who? - Who? Beri Saharoff. - Shlomi Shabbat. - And Leah Shabbat. Aki Avni, Lior Ashkenazi... Besides, we make the best bourekas. We invented the doner kebab! Really? - Could you do without Turkish coffee? - No. Are you done? Is Avi Bitter one of yours? What about the flotilla for Gaza? And Erdogan? The Turks are a plague! Let's go! 4 and 1 is good. Man, all celebrities are originally Moroccan. - Let's list them. - Go ahead. - Miri Buhadana. - One. - Yael Abecassis. - Two. - Moshe Ivgi. - Three. - Moshe Peretz. - Four. Kobi Peretz. - Five. - It's all written down. - We can go on all night. - Wait. - And Miki Buganim? - Six. Isn't he one of yours? - And Tali Fahima? - You got me. And Vanunu! Vanunu, you weirdo! Let's play. - We have time. - Let's go home. - Play. - Come on, roll. Let me beat you. - He talks so much. - Throw the dice. 4-3, great. 4-3... The best thing to come from you is Turkish baths. Now, beat it. Next in line, please. Next in line. - Boy, am I going to sleep well. - Make your move. Way to go, Yaakov. You nailed it. Love you, man. Come on, Kobi, I'll show you. Play with Elisha, I must talk to him. Elisha! Come, it's Judgment Day. Did you get some hash? David took care of us, don't worry. Listen... I wanted to talk about something. There's a new girl in the neighborhood. She walks around in revealing clothes. She's been asked not to, but she doesn't care. Isn't that promiscuous? - She causes others to sin. - Exactly. Yehuda showed me who she is. Yaniv, too. What's her name? Miri. - Do you know her? - No, how would I? Tomorrow then? Tomorrow. Hello, Miss Miri, 3rd floor, apartment 6. And you are...? Who I am? A modest Jew who does things by the book. God's book. You're not dressed properly. You're not at the beach. - Get out of my way. - See that? Sin after sin. Now you're talking rude. - Let me go! - Dress properly! Are you all going to beat me up? Nobody's beating nobody up. We're just asking you to respect the neighborhood. When you're out of town, do whatever you want. But here you have to respect the neighborhood and yourself. A Jewish girl doesn't go out like that. Better listen, or one day, you won't see your bicycle. - Are you threatening me? - God forbid. - I'm promising you. - Calm down. - I'm sure she understood. - Is that so? Sweetie, don't test us. We're asking nicely! - You're some men, threatening a girl! - Hey, you! Dress modestly! Kobi, I'll handle it. Believe me, Miri, I'm here for your sake. Are you done? Can I go home? Don't dress like this again, huh?! Enough. Let her pass. What was that about? Forget it. Sons of bitches... Nachman from Uman Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good For His mercy lasts forever Give thanks unto the Lord... It's killer, bro! It's sent from Heaven! Well done! You're ace! Micha! Micha! You hear? Listen. Isn't it killer? Yes, I just got the track. Bahar. Yes, the righteous Avraham Bahar, bless him. Gather everyone, tonight we're going for a ride. Okay, bye. You're great. You made the Rabbi so happy! You're so talented! Tel Aviv is going to jump to the sky! Even the Ashkenazim. Come on, Avraham, join us. You'll see how much respect your music gets. - Avner, I'm not into that... - Don't be a party pooper. It's a commandment to be joyous! - Let's go. - Some other time. - Come on. - I have to return to work. What's up, Miri? Can I have a word? What is it now? Not modest enough? No, it's fine this way. Now you're respectful. I don't owe you respect. Neither to your friends. I put this on because it's cold. Good day, "righteous one". Miri! Miri, wait up. I want to talk to you! Blessed are You, Lord, who has sanctified us and commanded us to put on Tefillin. I will engage thee unto Me in righteousness, in lovingness and in compassion, and thou shalt know the Lord. Hear O Israel, Lord our God, the Lord is one. Let me help you. It's okay, I can handle it. - I wanted to help you. - No need. Is it because of the incident in the hall? You think we'd hurt you? Look at me. Would I hit a girl? - I don't know. - Miri, wait. You don't even know why I'm here. Let me explain. You know why I'm here? Why are you here? Why am I here? How should I know? Weirdo... Didn't you lose anything? No. Not that I know of... No, I didn't lose anything. Nothing is missing? - What do you want? - Wait a second. Didn't you drop this on the way? Oh! It's so cute! What a darling! Hello! Where did you get it? I found it. It's so cute. Hello. Hello, kitten. Mitzi. Have fun with it. "Mitzi", how original. Besides, Mitzi is for a girl. This is a boy. Really? What should we name it then? I don't know... "Little Panther"? "Little Panther" is nice. One second. Hey, sweetie. I'm outside my building. Are you coming over? Okay, I understand. We'll talk. Okay, bye. Bye... Little Panther. He'll never leave you. That's right. We don't need anyone, do we, Little Panther? My mom will kill me! Why? He's cute. - Hey, Maurice. - Hi, Kobi. - Come here, buddy. - What is it? Next to the grocery shop, a guy is selling DVDs of improper movies. Everyone can see the porn covers. - Now? - Yes. He's still there? I just passed through there and saw the covers. I feel so dirty, I must read the 10 Psalms. Let's go. Dad, I'll be back. - Did you tell Yaniv? - Yes. Take a stick. - Where to? - I'll be right back! Yossi, give me assorted films, not always the same ones. Some with black and Asian women. People like variety. Don't bring the same stuff. Meet you in an hour. What would you like? The new James Bond? I have movies here that didn't hit the theatres yet. Can I ask you something? Leave this area. Don't sell these abominations here. Go elsewhere. Not here! Listen, pal, if you don't want to buy, scram. I'm asking you nicely, right? Please, dear Jew, respect the neighborhood. Take your stand and get out of here. Listen, "Nachman", you moron... This isn't Jerusalem here. If you don't want to buy... Scram! I'll sell wherever I want to. You reminded me of a saying: "They pardon the righteous "and convict the criminal." Amen. Itzik! Itzik! Itzik! Avi, watch out! Behind you! I'll bring my guys, just wait and see. Come here, I'll beat you up! You'll see, you asshole! Prick! You have no idea who I belong to. Neither do you! I belong to the Lord! And I think He wants you to get beaten up. Are you okay? Son of a bitch. It's Thursday, it'll be hectic. Take those two trays out while they're hot. Can I take 5 minutes, Moshe? - Only 5 minutes, okay? - 5 minutes. Miri, it's Thursday. You know how hectic it gets. - Hi. - What's up? What happened to your head? I slipped while playing soccer. - You don't know how to play? - A silly slip. Home delivery. Is it for kittens? It's for little panthers. It was expensive. Investing in Little Panther? I have friends in the safari. How is he? He's so cute... Incredible! You wouldn't believe it. If he sees a roll of toilet paper, - he kicks it around. - Really? He makes such a mess. He's cute. Want to see him tomorrow? Tomorrow is Friday, bless the Lord, who has time... I see. Don't you keep Shabbat? It depends. I go with the flow... My boyfriend and I just broke up. He'd only have time for me on Fridays. On Fridays he wanted to go out with you? But it says: "Stop work and rest." You know what "Vay" means in Yiddish? I don't speak Yiddish. God forbid, our souls don't get rest. Trust me, parties just burn time. You should experience the joy of Friday. If you join me on Friday, hang out, you'll get a lot. When was the last time you were at a party? Parties, I have plenty. I have a blast every day. But on Friday I rest. I gather my strength. Miri? Come on, table 2. Thanks. No problem, my treat. Shame on you, asshole, son of a bitch! Pass the ball. What's that: "pass the ball?!" What a disgusting guy... Good! Pass it to him! Good one! - Goal, David! - Don't you guard the goal? Give thanks unto the Lord for He is good for His Mercy lasts forever David... Smile, buddy. - Wear it, it'll help you. - What's the score? Lord, grant me good health... I'm so out of shape now. Were you ever in shape? Eliko, who goes first? We tore them apart, didn't we? David sprained his balls. When do we have to be at the synagogue? Al 4:30, I think. Soon Pinhas will announce: "Shabbat Shalom, House of Israel. "Candle lighting time "at 4:34." Tell me... What would you guys say if... If what? - Damn it. - Talk to us, bro. You're so dramatic... Tell us, everything is alright? Thank God. Thank God. What is it? Nothing. Come on, bro, stop squirming like a worm and talk! It's nothing serious. There's this cute girl. We're just friends. Dude! It's love from above... Stop this! Slop! A woman of valor, who can find? Talk to us, bro. Is she a righteous girl from the synagogue? That's the thing. She's not. And she's... Well, she's not from the synagogue. Where from? - Is she Russian? - God forbid! - I hope she's not a goy? - No! I'm just asking. Tell us who she is! Miri. Who's Miri? Miri! 3rd floor, apartment 6. You're kidding! For real? Yes, but we're just friends. Nothing more. Is she dressing modestly? Yes, she's respectful, thank God. That's great. You guys really think so? I really didn't know how to tell you this. It's totally cool, bro. As long as you're in control and won't fall. No touching or glances... You know the tests. "Don't follow your impulses..." Kobi, are you lecturing me? Who taught you? Enough! Why say these things? It's still a girl, and things have to be said. - You could make a mistake. - Don't worry! - I'm worried. - Enough! To me it sounds innocent, pure, clean. I approve. Okay? I approve too. Great. Shabbat Shalom. - Stop sulking. Shabbat Shalom. - Cut it out... - You okay? - Yes. All right then. What did Israel want? - He needs help to fix a water leak. - Let's go. There's Moshiko, that jerk. What's going on? It's Shabbat. Why get angry? Don't waste the Shabbat this way. We'll catch him on Sunday. Leave it. Fuck! This is bad luck! - So early in the morning... - And already unlucky! Who did this? How should I know? Who didn't observe the Shabbat? You? Have you no shame? I was open only a bit longer. My client had dye in her hair! I'll call the police, you're gonna get it. Nobody said it was us. So why are you bringing the police? He just asked if you were open on Shabbat. Shit happens to those who are open on Shabbat. - They get an X. - What do you learn from that? Have you no shame? You're religious? You're pieces of shit! And you, your mother is a whore... If you ever curse my mother again, I'll kill you! Leave me alone, son of a bitch! - Leave him! - Robert, stay out of this! Avi... Stop that! - Let him go! - Go home. - What's the big deal? - What's the big deal?! - Go away! - I'm calling the police. You'll end up in jail. I'm not scared! In jail they have kosher food, a synagogue No problem! Don't ever stay open on Shabbat! You know me. I never meddle in other people's business. Let me make a living peacefully... Avi, can we talk? Sure, something wrong? Yes, come. - What's the matter? - You threatened my cousin. You're lucky I stopped him from reporting you to the police. - Who's your cousin? - Moshiko, moron! - Moshiko's your cousin?! - Yes! Calm down, Miri. How could I know? If only I knew... Even if he weren't, you're not the mayor! - I did nothing to him. - Is that so? Just strangled him and ruined his store window! - But he cursed my mother. - What are you, a child?! Avi, I tried to respect you but you're a religious extremist. We're different. Stay away from me and my family! Avraham, is everything okay? - Hello, Maurice! - Hello! - How are you? - Good, thank God. And you? 2 kilos of oranges... - 10 shekels. - Please. - They're beautiful. - Thank you very much. Goodbye. - That all you got? - Yes. - If you don't like it, don't buy it. - I won't. - Aviko, what happened? - Nothing. Everything's great. Everything's great? Me, I don't know a thing No, no, I don't know a thing... How are you, Rabbi? What was that for? Why did you leave us last night? - What came up? - I had to leave. - Where to? - I had some errands to run! Why are you so edgy? Leave me alone, Kobi. What happened with Miri? - Kobi, listen... - Hey, Avraham. Did you watch the game last night? Macabbi played so lousy... Why do they pay that Abouzaglu so much? Tell me why. I turned off the TV at half-time. I didn't see the end. Do you know the score? Happy are those who dwell in Your house... What's eating you up, bro? Talk to me. Everything's okay, Kobi. Forget it... It's nothing serious. You shouldn't hide things from me. "You shall not hide anything from your friend." Where did that come from? The book of Kobi, Chapter 4. Everything's okay, bro. How did it go with Miri? Not good. She's not speaking to me. - Really? - It's about her cousin. We shouldn't have... Get her chocolates and flowers and you're good... You'll see. Remember those damn Arabs who passed by Elisha's? - Yes? - Last night they passed by again. Slowly, on purpose, with their stinking music on full volume. I was this close to beating them up. They started talking to each other in Arabic and laughed in my face. Avi, let's do something, let's ambush them. We're not in Jaffa, this is Bat Yam. Don't do a thing, you hear me? Leave it. Fine, what's come over you? Take care, buddy. Take the trays out, okay? Pizzeria Puzzi. Hello, I'd like to order a large cheese pizza. Any toppings? I'd like to top them with a lot of "sorry" and a bit of "understanding". What would you like? A lot of "sorry" and a bit of "understanding". Who's this? Miri, it's Avi. - Can I meet you later? - Avi, don't call here. Can I talk to you? Rabbi Avraham! You don't know what your music does. People go crazy! It's a hit! Cool, then here's another track. It's a rough-cut. Buddy, even your rough-cuts are masters. Bless Him for blessing you with this gift. - What's wrong, Avraham? - What? Why the long face, buddy? Forget it... I get knocked down all the time. What do you mean? What happened, buddy? What can I tell you, Avner? I wanted to help someone. But in the end, I hurt him. My grandmother had a Moroccan saying... "You came to give a kiss and took out an eye". Did you upset a Jewish soul? I wanted him to observe the Shabbat. He ended up getting angry at me. If you upset him, then you did the opposite of a good deed. - Yes. - You harmed him. Obviously. So what do I do? Is it a close friend? Can you contact him? - I see him now and then. - So now earn another good deed: - Forgiveness. - Forgiveness? It's an opportunity. What does our rabbi say? "You are in the same place as your thoughts. "Make sure they are in the place where you want to be." I don't get it. First you must forgive yourself. And then this man will forgive you. For sure. - Have you spoken to him? - With the guy? No, with God. Have you made your introspection? I'm dying to, Avner. What are you waiting for? He's available 24 hours a day. The line's never busy. Pour your heart out to Him. And purify yourself. Okay? "He hears your prayers "and answers in times of trouble." - My brother. - Avner, you're a righteous man. Me? You are! May God keep you safe. May God keep you safe. Wait, wait. Give this to Kobi and do another track. We'll release an album. That's to repent for my mistake. Are we good? That's to repent for my mistake. Are we good? You need anything? Closed on Fridays You don't give up, do you? "There is no despair in the world... at all." What do you want? What do you want? I want to walk you home. May I? Miri... Miri... I thought a lot about what you told me. And so... You were right about many things. I admit. When my mom died, my life changed completely. When my mom died, my life changed completely. My father fell apart. He didn't leave the house for two months. I had to take care of everything. Our home was filled with crying during the mourning period... I was busy taking tables in and out, arranging the food and the prayers. And then I had to take over the shop. On the anniversary of her death, the rabbi came over and sat in the corner quietly. After an hour, he got up, took me aside, told me some biblical discourses. Then he looked into my eyes and said: "Avi, cry. "Cry. "You must cry. "You must cry. "They can hear you in Heaven." I understand you. When my parents got divorced, it was tough on me. Really? I haven't spoken about this for years, but... I haven't spoken about this for years, but... when a family falls apart... it's tough. Tell me, why do the Breslov men dance like that? To express their joy. They're happy. Do you know our music? They're happy. Do you know our music? It puts people in a trance. I compose the best trance tracks. - Will you play them for me some day? - Sure. Okay, well... Okay, well... Good night. A blessed night. May you have pious dreams. Tell me, how wrong would it be of me to hug you? How wrong would it be of me to hug you? I'd love... to hug you too, but your desire to do so is enough for me. Okay. Good night. Yes, Rahamim, no problem. Everything's okay. No problem. You can come over. Bye. You can come over. Bye. Avi? Rahamim is bringing the potatoes. Clear some space for them. No problem, Pops, I will. You're cheerful this morning! You're cheerful this morning! Very cheerful. Hey Kobi. What? Kobi, talk slowly. Where? Here? Okay, wait for me, I'll be right there. No religious people - no terrorism Look what they did, Avraham. Look! This means war. We're going to sit on the roof and ambush them. We'll beat them up. Look what they did. Look what they did. Am I right, Avi? You tell me. What is this?! I bet it's those Russians. How could they do this?! - What's this? - Yaniv, do you believe this? What a shame! I'm painting the third coat. I'm painting the third coat. - Who did it? - Must be those damn Russians. Paint over it, children can see it. Take a paintbrush. Sons of bitches! Damn it... I scrubbed myself and still have paint on me. Turpentine, alcohol, acid, but it won't come off. How much longer shall we wait? What is it, Avi? You're not up for ambushes anymore? Did you forget the operations we did in Hebron? Border police, August 9th, Hebron. Border police, August 9th, Hebron. God forgets, a border policeman doesn't. We'd beat the crap out of them. Kobi, you should've seen us. We were like two lions! I caught an Arab, Avi hit him. Avi hit him. Then he caught one and I kicked his balls. You and your Hebron stories, I'm tired of them. Here we hit them after the lynching in Ramallah. Comparing here to Hebron? Me and David, the thug. Me and David, the thug. David saw some crappy Arab throwing rocks. We caught him, pinned him to the floor and kicked his face and head... He was so surprised... It's them. Let's go! Look. Are those Jews? Look. Look at that scumbag. Those kids? Kids or not kids, they're peeing on us. Kids or not kids, they're peeing on us. I'll teach them a lesson. If you don't care stay here. Avi, let's scare them a little bit. Come on. What are you doing?! Are you nuts? He's 16 years old! If you have something to say, just say it! - You're nuts! - I've had it with your moods! You've lost it! You've lost it! - Me?! - Yes! Since Miri came into the picture, you've changed. You're not the same Avi. Am I right, Lugassi? A little. Is that so? Is that so? You're either with us or not. You decide. Avi, I mean it, we miss you. I have to strengthen my faith. Right, Kobi? "God differs us from wrong-doers". - Wait! - Let him go, Yaniv. Read the 10 Psalms! Come read them! Restart yourself! Throwing it all away for a girl! Throwing it all away for a girl! First of all, if we're talking, I want to thank you very much for our livelihood. "Thou open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing." It took me a while to come talk to You. We had some trouble in the neighborhood. All sorts of wrong-doers... and Kobi and Yaniv... I love them. I love them. Tell me what I'm supposed to do. I like Your laws. "The King of righteousness and judgment", this is You! What am I babbling about? What for? My biggest mess right now, is that I lost focus. This cute girl is confusing me. I guess You've seen her. "Seen her"... I'm such a moron! You created her! You created her! What will I do with her? She has a good soul. Doesn't she? She has a good heart, she's sweet, respectful, she's even pretty, bless You for all Your deeds. For all Your deeds. But tell me what I must do with her. Whatever I do for Your sake makes her unhappy. She says I'm not right. So I'm asking You now: So I'm asking You now: Am I right? If she's not the woman for me, if she'll only do me harm, give me a sign and I'll end it! One word from You! One word from You! But if You sent her to me so she can rectify me, if she's the woman for me, then tell me. Then tell me. Talk to me! You're all-knowing! I trust only You! I listen only to You! I listen only to You! I love You, Sovereign of the Universe! I love You! I'm happy with You, I swear! I thank You every day! I thank You everyday! I thank You everyday! The Lord is ruler, the Lord was ruler, The Lord shall rule forever and ever. You're so cute! Where was this taken? At my Bar Mitzvah. - You were bummed out. - You never had a Bar Mitzvah... It's a big production... You can take some books to read. All the Breslov books are good. Take one. The Empty Chair "Always remember: "there's no obstacle you can't overcome." Amen. Good saying. But the best book of all... Psalms, of course I know it. I used to read it a lot, but now... I don't get around to it. Is that so? You know that thing about Psalms? - What thing? - You don't know? What? It shows your state each time you open it. What do you mean? Open it, and whatever page you land on, that will be the state you're in. Like an X-ray. Sometimes it's very clear. And sometimes... it's clear. - Try it. - You're not kidding me? I opened Psalms many times, looking for answers. Do it. But be serious. Okay. Be serious, stop laughing! Wow... What does it say? "The glory of the King's daughter is within her, "despite her worked gold clothing." What does that say about me? - You're kidding me, right? - No... Are you serious? Let me see. Avi, you're scaring me. What does it mean? Is it good or bad? It's good, of course it is. It's great! Forget it, bro! - Avi is your pal! - Leave me alone. Enough. Drop it. I have no strength. You're supposed to say: "Give me strength." Don't give up. Where's the third stooge? Forget it, he's no good! - Did you have a fight? - Just forget it, pal. We don't need him. He was damaged. As they say: "Keep me away from those who love me..." I get it. It's about that girl... What's the name of that Pocahontas? Miri. Elisha, leave us, go sell some snacks! Avi... I want to tell you something. Seriously. But don't get too excited. What? Seriously... For some time now, I really feel like... It's not because of you, so don't think that... Well, it's also because of you, but I really want to... It's not new to me, it's just... What is it, you pest? What? I want to come with you to the synagogue for Shabbat. You're kidding? For real? Sweetie... Blessed is His name for eternity! Wow! For real? Yes. This is great. You know you're going to be my wife? I knew you'd get too excited! It's those damn Arabs... I am going to beat them up! - Let it go... - Fuck you, Yaniv! Keep sitting here like a faggot! Damn you, son of a bitch! You forgot to say the blessing. - That all was "created by His word." - Relax! You're sweet. You made me so happy. Praised be the Lord that all was created by His word. Fight! Come look at this fight! What's going on down there? A fight? What's wrong, Avi? Avi, where are you going? Avi, where were you? It was crazy. Look at this blood. Let go of me! Avi, Avi! Kobi! Kobi! I want to see him. Let me see him! Move! I want to see him! Move, I want to see him! He's my friend, I tell you! Avi, how are you? Did I scare you? No, honored Rabbi. I was just preoccupied. Hello, honored Rabbi. - When is the evening prayer? - 7:20. Hello, honored Rabbi. Avi, I want to talk with you. Got a moment? Sure. Praised be the Lord that all was created by His word. That little prayer you just said, Avi, do you have any idea what it means? What it stands for? That all was created by His word... What is God's goal? What is the purpose of His creation? Ever think about that? So that we know that absolutely everything was created by... His word. You understand? Everything in a person's life depends on God's will. Livelihood, health, a wife, children, war or peace... What do you want, Avi? War or peace? Of course I want peace. Of course. Then let the Lord decide for you. He's our supervisor. Believe me. Hey, buddy. What do they say? He didn't wake up yet. He didn't?! Quiet. Listen, Kobi is like a brother to me. Those bastards will have to deal with me. So we won't sit here like faggots. I won't wait! Be quiet! We are going to burn Jaffa tonight! Come here! Take a look. Look at this! Well? You see? I never let you down, right? Today, we're getting Bat Yam's respect back. This is it. Put it back! Yaish, put those back! Give it to me. What are you, little boys? Leave it alone... Miri calling Give it to me, Turjeman. Moshiah, that's enough. Come on, get in the car. Go sit in the back, we have a guest. Get in, Avi. I swear I'm going to kill every Arab I see. Regardless of who stabbed Kobi... I'll kill them all. That's it. They'll see how David fucks them. This way. Hey, buddy. Turn left, I'll wait for you at the corner. We'll be right there. Take your shoes off the seat! We're gonna fuck them up. Bless You, Lord, who trained my hands for war. Are you praying "Kaddish" for them? Wacko... First let us catch them. Praying "Kaddish", it's cute. Take off my license plates. Go help him with the Molotov cocktails. Make it snappy. Shamli, see that the Molotov cocktails are okay. Don't spill any of them or I'll break your bones. There are 4 Arabs there, they look like the type. - Okay, buddy, go. - Give me a bottle. Let's go bust them up. - Have fun. - David, I'm off. Hear O Israel... God is one. Amen. Get in already! A Sun! Shoot him, Avi! Shoot the bastard! Do it! Fuck him up! Shoot him, in Kobi's name. Shoot him! Let's get out of here! Avi! Go, go! May God bless you, our Lord, and guard you... A sign unto Zion will I give, and to Jerusalem a messenger of good news. I will lift the cup and call upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, save us! We beseech Thee, O Lord! Make us prosper! Bless everything we undertake! Blessed are You, Lord, who creates the fruit of the vine. Blessed are You, Lord, who created varieties of aromas. Blessed are You, Lord, who creates the light of the fire. Blessed are You, Lord, who separates sacred from secular, light from darkness, Israel from the nations, the 7th day from the six days of Creation. Blessed are You, Lord, who separates sacred from secular.
