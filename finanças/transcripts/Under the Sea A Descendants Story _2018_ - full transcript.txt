Mal And it was whispering my name, and... What was stranger, was it sounded exactly like... Dad?! I don't know. I don't know. It couldn't be dad. That would be impossible, so... haha. Wait, why are you out here? I'm looking for you! Remember? We're supposed to meet up at Curl Up 'n Die hours ago. Oh shoot. It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'm just excited to... Dizzy? You okay? Hello? Of course I'm okay. Okay. There's just so much... glam to add, and so little time. Starting with these nails. Okay, just because they're called cuticles, does not mean they're cute. Hey. Dizzy, why are you? Glowing? Glowing? Huh... this is Enma's necklace. Dizzy, why are you wearing Uma's necklace? What are you talking ab...? I wouldn't say that, Dizzy's wearing my necklace... it's more like, the necklace is wearing Dizzy. Uma, your fight is with me. No one else, and she's a child. This is so low, even for you. Oh... I can go lower, Princess. Oops. Just you wait. Wow! Okay. So then, where are your, slimy little eels... here to ruin your evil plans huh? Shouldn't they be showing up sometime soon? Or, do I actually have something to be afraid of for once in my life? You should definitely be frightened. You never seem to learn your lesson do ya, Mal. You're not welcome on the island anymore. Really? And what are you gonna do about it, huh? Mr. Coathanger? His name is Harry. Oh, I get it, I get it. Kinda looks like a... That's pretty funny, Mal. Thank you! I'll be here all week. You know, you're not as strong as you think you are, Mal. Uma's gonna have the last laugh. I wouldn't want to be you right now, Mal. I wouldn't want to be her, ever. What makes you think this is going to be any different than any every other time that I've beaten you, huh? Those were measley little battles. There's a war coming. And in this war, I will be childing. I'll have everything. The isle. Auradon... and you, Princess? I'm coming for you, Mal. Mal. Oh yeah?

I was walking...thru the woods and I came across this, like, glowing orb thing. And... And you were Uma. You were speaking with Uma's voice. You had Uma's voice. And then I was underwater? And I could swim. Okay. Maybe you shouldn't go back over the bridge just yet. I could give you a makeover! I'm sure it'll make you feel better. Besides, you def wanna look your best tomorrow. You like? Here, take it. Actually, no. I think it might clash with tomorrow's outfit. Mal. Did you hear that? Yeah. Dizzy, I think we might want to get out of here. There's danger coming. I can feel it. And I think it might be headed for Auradon. That's right, Mal. Danger is coming for you. And you better keep your eyes open. Cause this time... you'll never see where it's coming from. You poor unfortunate soul.
