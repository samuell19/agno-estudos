Brian Robertson, speaking with us today about his best-selling book, "My Senior Year." - 42! Set, hike! Yeah, that's me. Not him. Him. That's my mom. Well, at least at the time she was. Are you okay? - No sweat but, yeah, I'm fine. - Oh my goodness! I kept asking my dad where she went. And he always said she would be right back. I wanted to be like most kids and have recess to play football with the guys. I wanted to go biking in the summer with friends as if we were a pack of birds with nowhere to go but just fly 'cause we had the freedom to. I wanted to be a part of something. But for me, it just seemed like a far dream from being reality. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Brian ♪ - Whoa! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ A succession was the first lesson of my life ♪ ♪ Had to walk on the darker side ♪ You see, when I was nine years old, life was, wonderful.

I never understood why my mom and dad yelled so much. Then, the yelling just stopped. Mom, please don't go! - I'm sorry. My mom disappeared for good. - Please mom! There's gotta be a way! - Supposedly, she went on a trip. - I'm sorry, son. - Please! Don't leave me! But that trip was a one-way ticket. It seemed like there was no return. So then, me and dad, like everything else in our lives, just packed up and kept on trucking. You see, my dad wanted me and him to be very close. This could never happen with me going to school and his career as a semi driver. ♪ 'Cause I am free ♪ So after my parents split up, my dad took some classes so he was able to be my teacher. And from then on, I was home-schooled. I always wondered what a real life would be like. What if my mom and dad would have stayed together and nothing changed from when I turned nine? Maybe I would have a good friend or two. And even a girlfriend. Every day I wonder about that life I've never had.

I think it's time for me to actually experience a real teenager's life. It's just... Well, you went to college and high school. I've seen the pictures. You look like you enjoyed life. I mean, if I go to a college, which we're both planning on. - Of course. - Not only will I not know how to act around kids my age. I won't know what to do when I meet a girl or meet a good friend. And I love spending time with you, don't get me wrong. But don't you want me to enjoy my life? - Okay. Guess we'll have to figure out your schedule for first quarter. - Thanks, dad. Yes. - Hey, man! - Hey! - You look pretty lonely. You wanna come sit with me and the guys? We love welcoming the new kid. - Yeah, I would love to! - Dude, don't worry. This isn't "Mean Girls." Instead of the new kid being popular here, at this school, we couldn't give a shit about you. I'm joking, man. My name's Jake. - What's up? I'm Brian. You guys here sure like to pull each other's chain. - First off, you're gonna have to use different slang. - Different what? - Different word usage! - Oh. Okay. I can do that. - You'll find out every group has their one-liner, "That's whack!" "That's cool!" And the stoners are: "Yeah, man." "Stay high, stay fly." - I think I can remember that. - That's good to know. So, do you know anybody at this school? - No. This is my first day. - Come sit by me and the guys, then. - All right. - All right. Guys, this is Brian. This is Tim. - What's going on, man? One on the thumb, one on the elbow. - And this is Eric. - What up, bro-ski? No. So, you new here, man. - Yeah. This is actually my first day of regular school. I was home-schooled by my dad. - What?

Why don't you back off before I make you. Come on, Sara, let's go. - I'm not going anywhere. - Whatever. Stay with this faggot. - I think I'll be fine. Buh-bye! Thanks a lot. You're a life saver. Brian, right? Yeah. - Or is that Boner? - You heard about that? - Yeah, I think the whole school heard about it. - Yeah, I guess. - So, you think you could give me a ride home? - No, I drank too much already. - Well, I only live a few blocks away. We could walk. - Yeah, definitely. So let me ask you this. What do you see in that jerk? - Well, Brad, when we first met, was really sweet. Then, beginning of last summer, he really showed his true colors. - So, why didn't you just dump him then? - We've been daring about two years, and our families are friends, so I guess it just made sense in that light. - That's ridiculous, though. I mean, has he ever been that aggressive with you before? - Yeah. He's hit me in the face before. Actually, a couple times. I guess I felt like I wasn't worth that much. - Hey. If I was even fortunate enough to have you in my life, I'd show you the true princess you really are. - You're so sweet. - Smooth job, Brian. You should've kissed her. - Brian. What's this? - It's, it's-- - It's a must-ground is what it is. - Dad! - What? If one of those kids drove home drunk, got in an accident, we'd be liable! We'd lose everything! - Well, I'm sorry! - You're damn right you are. No TV, no internet, no hanging out with friends for a month! - Dad, you can't do this! I just started making friends! - You should've thought of that before you had the party, shouldn't ya? - You know the misery you've put me in? I mean, sure, at times it was fun driving with you all across the damn country, but all I really wanted was to have a normal teenager's life! To be able to have friends, and to play baseball, something, you know? You know what it's like to not have anyone to talk to besides you or maybe Fat Joe, the local semi driver who tells the same boring-ass stories every god-forsaken time you talk to the guy? I mean, that's fine if you want that life. But after mom left, all I wanted was for her to come back so we could have a normal family life again. Driving for 50 hours a week for 52 weeks isn't normal! Never having a first kiss at 17 isn't normal! So if I want to throw a party so I can try to make some friends to make up for the shitty life I've had, I mean, I don't see the problem. - You know what? Life hasn't been anything near normal for me either, Brian. You know what it's like to love someone only to have 'em leave ya? You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. And son, when your mother left, it was hard. Hard for me to move on. - Dad. Don't worry, I'll always be there.

But I'm gonna give him a welcome he won't forget. - Hey Brian, it's Sara. - How did you get my number? - I got it from Jake. Did you not want me calling you? - No, no, no. I do. - I just wanted to thank you again for walking me home the other night. It was really nice of you. - Yeah, it was no problem. Did you have fun at the party? - Yeah. Well, except for my ex-boyfriend making a big scene in front of everyone. - Ex-boyfriend? - Yeah. I split it off with him. It was time. - Sorry to hear about that. - Are you? - Honestly, no. That guy seemed like a jackass. Any guy that hits a girl should probably be in jail. - Yeah, you're right on that one. - But, good news. My dad's actually gonna be gone next weekend out of town.

After all we've been through? - All we've been through is bullshit, Brad. What about our families? - They can still be friends. Doesn't mean I have to be forced into dating you. - Fine! See the new kid. I don't care. Both your broke asses can watch me score touchdowns on Sunday. Thought I told you to get out of the way! - Hello? - Hey, Brian, it's Brad. - Oh. Hey. - So, you know, I've decided I've been an asshole about the whole situation with Sara. - It's all right. I understand it must be tough. - Oh, it sure is, buddy. So, I think we should talk, you know, to be civil about things. Would tonight work to meet? - Sure. - You know, 'cause I've dated Sara for a few years now, and I think I could give you some good pointers if you want to have a long-term relationship with her. - All right. We can do that. - Great. Meet me at St. Charles church at 10 p.m. Brian! Oh, I forgot to mention some of the guys were coming along. You know Tony and Brock? - You don't have to do this. - You don't steal my girl from me, especially at a party, and not expect to pay the consequences. - Maybe if you weren't such an asshole she'd still be with you. - All right, listen, Brian. I get what I want. Plain and simple. I wanted the football scholarship, I got that. I wanted a girl with a nice ass so I could pound it for a few years, and I got that.

And his friend blindsided me! - Where's your dad at? - He's doing a few shipments in the south. - Well, hopefully that'll be enough time for it to heal. - Yeah. Man, that kid needs to get a taste of his own medicine. - It's gonna do no good. Dad is super-protective. If he finds out, he'll probably take you out of school. - Well, I'm gonna be 18 in about a month, so then I'll do whatever I want to do. I lived his life for 10 years! It's my time now! - What's wrong? This was a good time in my life. - How old are you there? - I was eight. You have no idea how many times I've looked at this picture. - Why is that? - Well, after this, life was hell. After this picture was taken, my parents divorced and I was basically stripped of my childhood. - What's wrong? - Did you see Brad the other day? - Brian, I did, but it was nothing. - So, what, you're gonna leave me for that tool? - No! Of course not. - So why are you seeing him, then? I thought you liked me. - I do like you. Maybe a little too much. Honestly, it was nothing. He came up to me in the hallway and was a complete jackass. Don't worry. I have no intentions on ever seeing him again. Let's go to bed. - Oh my God, did you fight a bear? - Nah, I got set up by my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. - Oof. You know, I could kill him if you like. - I think I can handle him. - All right. So, what are you doing here? - Well, I actually came by to see if you knew when my dad was getting back from the South. - Have you heard of this brand-new thing? It's called a cellphone, Brian. - Yeah, well, ever since that party, me and him haven't really been that cool. - Ah, don't worry about that, kiddo. He loves you more than anyone I know. In fact, if I got paid for every time he talked about you, shit, I wouldn't work here. - You're a dork, Steve. - Be that as it may, I have a very serious question for you, Brian. Have you heard of this shirt called the slim fit? - The one that makes you look skinnier? - Yes, that is the one. The good news is is that it does work as advertised. I mean, look at me, right? - Right. - But with that it's like, boom! I look buff as shit! - You must have the ladies rolling in then, right? - Oh, yeah! Yeah, absolutely. As long as that shirt stays on, we are good. But when the shirt comes off, shit hits the fan. I mean, girls will literally try to kill you when the see the blubber field coming at them. They can't move it. One girl, she got lost in it. But that, it's a different story for a different day. - You're crazy, Steve. - You know, a little birdie told me that you have yourself a girlfriend. - Yeah. - Just don't fall in love. - Why's that? - Well, you love this girl and she doesn't love you back, ain't nothin' worse. And I mean nothin'. All right. I better get back to work. Make 'em think I'm doing something. - Right. See you later, Steve. She sang like an angel. I knew right there this was the girl for me. All those years staring into the stars, wondering if I would find somebody that could make me happy, and now I found Sara. ♪ A storm can feel the canyon's breath. ♪ ♪ The blowing dust can blind the best ♪ ♪ And when the dust returns to stone ♪ ♪ Remember that you're not alone ♪ ♪ All the hopes that refuse to part ♪ ♪ With healing hands upon your heart ♪ ♪ When the pale moon sleeps at night ♪ ♪ An angel falls from celestial light ♪ ♪ She feels the tears that fall like rain ♪ ♪ And for a moment she will lose the pain ♪ ♪ As it becomes misunderstood ♪ ♪ That all things evil once were good ♪ ♪ And good things will never fall apart ♪ ♪ With healing hands upon your heart ♪ - I can't believe you brought a megaphone to the game last night. I feel like you'd have such a fun Dad. - Well, trust me, I mean, there were times when we were at each other's throats. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Dude, listen! Leave Sara and me alone, or next time I'll hurt you twice-- - Hey, Brian! You're coming with me! - This isn't over Robertson! - Brian! First you're throwing parties when I told you not to! Then your grades start slipping! Now you're getting into fights at school and making threats! Where's my son at? - Dad, he threw me into a locker and was throwing a punch at me! What do you expect, you know? For me to shake his hand when he's a no-good piece of shit that hits girls and that's actually hit Sara? - He's hit Sara? - Yeah! That's a big reason why she dumped him! Because he's so aggressive. - Well, still, let the law take care of itself! Bad people always get what they got coming to 'em! - Well I'm not just gonna sit back and watch a guy who's hit my girl and who's throwing a punch in my face and say, "Oh, geez, I think I'm gonna "let the law work itself out." That shit's not gonna happen! - I'm not even gonna ground you. You're 18 now. Figure it out for yourself. But if anything else happens, I'm not gonna bail your ass out of jail. And if you keep it up, you can look for a new roof over your head, too! You got that? - Hey, man. You look like you need to, chill out. - Dude, I know. My dad and I got in another fight after he found out what happened between me and Brad. - Man, he had it coming! That's what I'm saying. - Hey, man, we're about to go out for lunch. You wanna roll with us? - Only if it's cloudy. 'Cause if it was nice out, I was gonna play catch with Steve. - Oh, it definitely will be cloudy. That's right. - All right, I'll come with. - Oh, let's go. - Let's go. - Let's take my scooter. - You want some of this shit, man? - What is it? - What? Have you ever heard of Mary Jane? - Like from Spider-man? - Right, but this is called Marijuana, as in the drug. - Nah, you guys, I can't smoke. If my Dad finds out, I'll have to move. - Our parents don't care. That's why we went to Highville High. - Boner. The smokin' Boner. - That makes sense. - Nah. I'm kidding with you again, man. You gotta stop being so gullible. - All right, well, I'll still hang out with you guys. - No, get out of the car. Ah! God dude, help me, I'm starving! Well it just so happens I've got some sweet, sugary goodness in my pocket. Do you? Yeah. It's a special brownie. You know the one thing I regret from high school? That I didn't run for class president. I mean, you guys just think Tim's all about partying, but I could've made some real changes. Shit, shit, shit! It's a cop! Pull over, man! We're already parked.

Right? - Live the dream. - Right. License and registration. - Okay, yup. - Oh, here you go, here you go. License. - And believe this is what you're looking for, man. - Do I look like a man? - Dude, it's a trick question. He's a lady cop. - Are you a lady cop? - What's up, man? - Do you need a ride? - Yeah. Yeah, I do need a ride. - All right, let's go. This is great. Are you going back to school? - Oh, yeah. What are you doing on the side of the road? - Taco Bell receipt. Really? - I guess. - Sir, get out of the vehicle. Now? - Get out of the car! - We're on our way to school. - School. You're hindering our learning. It'll be fine, it'll be fine. - Put your hands on the vehicle. And spread your legs. Hands on the vehicle and spread your legs. Getting frisked!
