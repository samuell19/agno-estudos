Oh, what's that for? Be careful, because you might die… Without being able to fight for the one you truly love. What? Is this some kind of a joke? The person I love just passed away. In fairness to you, cousin, you're really good - at seeing through people. - Of course. - Lots of people here. - You're one of a kind. Oh! Look, it's Thursday Girl. Oh! Cousin! Where are you going? Hey, miss! Miss! You left your ring. Oh, my God! My wedding ring! Thank you! What? I said, "Thank you." I owe you one. No need. It's okay! Thank you! Take care! What did Thursday Girl say? She said she owed me one. - She owes you one? What for? - I don't know what's with her. - Why? Did you take something from her? - I don't know… - Where are you going? - Let's see what the fuss is about. Forget it. It's getting dark. Uncle is looking for us. - Isn't that... - There's nothing you can do anyway. Let's go home. What the… Who are you? Good morning, sis. I'm taking a bath. Very good! You're so responsible. Dad, Marc, rise and shine! Let's eat! What took you so long, sis? It would've been faster if you had helped out. Why was your bed making weird noises earlier? That was… …morning prayer. Really? A prayer? Cousin! Cousin, wait, wait. Cousins! Wait, I need to eat, too. When it's time to eat, you move fast. But when it comes to looking for a job, you take your time. And you? Why are you at the head of the table? Are you a relative? I'm your distant cousin. That still counts as a relative. So anyway, I checked the Chinese calendar to see if it's okay to apply for jobs right now. It's all black. I don't want to move. I don't want to live. Hey! Can you please stop relying on that calendar? We have to follow feng shui. We have Chinese lineage, even if it's not obvious. Your cooking is delicious. You're wife material! If your sister gets married, what will happen to us? Nothing! We'll starve. Especially you. You'll have nothing to eat. - Why are you picking on me again? - Aren't you unemployed? - Pao. - Yes? What kind of luck do I need to get a boyfriend? Oh, dear. If I were as unlucky in love as you, I wouldn't wait for luck. If I got a chance, I'd grab it. I wouldn't be so picky anymore. I do want to find love, but I'm still going to be picky, okay? Wow. I like the confidence. But you know what, I feel you. You're stuck with all your family responsibilities, so I get how hard it is for you. Sure, keep rubbing it in. Pao, all I want is to meet a man, a handsome, loving one... Hey! You think you're king of the road here? - Are you Mr. Ongpin? - This guy's crazy. What's your problem? - Why are you in the middle of the road? - Hi. Don't get mad, sir. I just wanted you to come out so I could apologize. What? Uh… Sorry, sir. Unbelievable! - Go wipe that up! - Unbelievable! Sorry, sir! I'm Stacey Likauko, by the way. I've lived here for 09171434469 years. I'm Nathan. I have to go. Sir, where are you going? Do you want me to go with you? What was that about? Huh? You're such a flirt! Boo-boo! Yoo-hoo! Boo-boo? Is that guy more important than your business? Feel my heartbeat. It's beating so fast. Cousin… I think this is it. I've found him! Thank you, sir. Am I in heaven already? Do you think he'll come here? Approach him. Yes. I will. I can easily be persuaded. Hi there! - You again? - Nice to see you again! You might want to buy from our store over there. - I am a seer. I can predict your future. - You're so annoying. Come on, please? Please, please, please. - Fine. - Come with me! - Where is it? I'm in a hurry. - We're in the Chinese-looking booth. Where? I'm also Chinese, in case you're wondering. Sit there. Sit! Cousin! What are you doing? Um… Okay. Give me your hand. Quickly. What I can see through your eyes and palms is that… There's something or someone you want to come back, but they're long gone. And… maybe, you're also looking for a new love? All right. Um… Okay. If you're that good, tell me… …what's my favorite color? Blue. For freedom. "Blue, for freedom." How does blue symbolize freedom? Okay. Pretty good. Where do I work? He's the boss of an IT company. You're the boss in an IT company. Right? - Yes! - Okay… Okay. Last. Why do I come to Quiapo? Because this is where your heart died. "Because this is where your heart died?" What? - Are you stalking me? - That's offensive. - You're a stalker. - Stalk you? It's not that. Hey, wait! Hey! This is your fault. - What have you been whispering to me? - What? I wasn't able to get him to add me on Facebook. - I wasn't whispering anything. - What? I haven't spoken a word. Don't blame me. Sorry! Guys, please don't forget your deliverables, okay? - Good afternoon, sir! - Sir Nix, Delos Reyes Foods - is backing out of the deal. - Why? Their boss is so disappointed because they waited so long for us. Seriously? Okay, let's end for today. Sir! Sir, I need you to sign these checks. Hold up! Next time, don't have me sign checks on Thursdays. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Where have you been, bro? Quiapo Church. It can't always be like this. We're losing clients. Find new ones. Take care of it. Get yourself back in the game. It's hard to run a company that you put up alone. You think Sara would be happy if she sees you like this? LUCKY ME AND YOU HOUSE OF CHARMS Dad. Good evening, Uncle. I haven't had any luck. Go ahead, talk to him. I'll take care of this. It's all right. Dad, maybe luck hasn't arrived because it doesn't take you seriously. Look at yourself. You look like a cartoon. You don't have faith in your own dad. Dad, look. Not that I'm disrespecting feng shui, but… What if we don't get any luck? Will we always be like this? Will I always be like this? Stuck? Down? Of course… I also want to find my own luck. Why? Are you tired of us already? That's why… You want to be on your own? So dramatic! I hope… When you become successful… You won't forget us. Of course, Dad. How can I resist you? I can't resist any of you. Yes! Just order anything you want. It's my treat! That's why you're my favorite cousin. - Really? - Yes! - How'd you get so many sales? - I just got lucky. You want some dumplings, right? - How many? - I want some pork, beef. - You? - Frog! - Add some frog. - You can't, that's your cousin! Why not? That's okay. Eat your family. So that's why your heart died… You again? Are you really stalking me? Here we go again with the stalking. Didn't I tell you that I've lived here in Binondo for around 09... Yes, I know, you've lived 09171434469 years here. Yes, I remember. You know my number, yet you didn't text… Are you flirting with me? So how long has your girlfriend been dead? Wife. Almost one year now. Died from a car accident in Quiapo along with… Oh, no, poor girl… Yes, and it's none of your business. Died in Quiapo last year… Wait a minute… Is your wife Thursday Girl? "Thursday Girl"? She was tall, slim, had long, black hair… Beautiful, like me. Uh-huh? And she was always in Quiapo every Thursday. You know my wife? - No, no. - You knew each other? I used to see her in Quiapo every Thursday. Lighting a candle to celebrate… …every Thursday the first time we've met. "Lighting a candle… …every Thursday to celebrate the first time we've met." - Did you hear that? - How do you know that? After that, we go to bed and do some… "After we eat here, we go to bed and we…" Hey, hold it right there! Why do I hear moaning? Why is someone moaning? But, please, let me go, Boo-boo. "Please let me go, Boo-boo." "Boo-boo"? That's what we used to call each other. Stacey! Stacey! Hey! Wait! I need to get out here. He's still there! Hey, wait! You can talk to Sara? Yes! Maybe! I don't know! Can you please stay away from me? You have a ghost with you. - Go! - No, no, no! What else is she telling you? What are you not telling me? Fine. I liked you from the moment I met you. There, now go! That's not what I'm asking! Wait, what is it? I don't know, I keep hearing something. I wish I just heard "Resorts World Manila." But what I'm hearing are whole sentences, like… Nathan Torres, husband of Sara Lustre-Torres… "Nathan Torres, husband of Sara Lustre-Torres…" Residing at Penthouse Unit 6 Libert… - "Libert Tower 143 BGC Parkway." - …House 143 BGC Parkway… Will you let go of your wife? "Will you let your wife go?" Sara! Sara! Where are you? I'm here! - Why am I hearing this? - Sara, talk to me! Talk to me! Where are you? Let go of her! One more step and you'll face the three fingers of death. Begone, spirit! Begone, spirit! - Keep going! - Begone, spirit! - Louder! - Begone, spirit! - Keep going! - Begone, spirit! More! Begone, spirit! Begone, spirit! Begone, spirit! Begone, spirit! - Keep going! - Begone, spirit! - Louder! - Begone spirit! - Hello! - Begone, spirit! - I'm here! - Begone, spirit! She says she's here! You guys are overreacting. Where are you? Why can't I see you? I don't know! Maybe because you guys don't have third eyes? What's important is that I can talk to you. Dad, cousin, it seems like I'm the only one she can talk to. Even better, you're the only one who will be haunted. No! I'm not a ghost. I swear! I won't scare you. She says she's not a ghost. Don't say that. She doesn't want to scare us. - She heard that? - She heard it? She can hear us! Wait a second… What do you need from me? I just need you to help Nathan move on. She says I need to help Nathan move on. Don't do it! Don't! Nathan thinks you're his bridge to me. So I'm sure he won't stop bothering you. He will bring you to all the places that were special to us. And the plan is… …you have to ruin all of those memories. Why me? Why can't it be him instead? No, don't! You're the only one I can talk to. I tried whispering to so many people, but only you can hear me. That means I'm your only bridge to Nathan? Stacey, don't agree to it, okay? Don't! All right, all right. I'll help. I'll help Nathan move on. If I know, …it's because you want Nathan for yourself. True! Be quiet. This is my chance for Nathan and I to get close. When that happens, we can end up together. I heard you. Sorry! I forgot that you can hear me. Sorry. Stacey, I don't have a problem if you like my husband. What? Are you for real? You're okay with that? Why would I stop my husband from finding new love? All right, I'm game! Let's do it! I'll help Nathan move on. Didn't we tell you not to do it? The articles you asked me to research, sir. Okay, okay. Thank you. It's a miracle. What's this? Wait. Is this for real? Are you back? Are you back? - Yeah, man. - No way, you're back! He's back! Whoo-hoo! Sara's back, man. - Sara? - Yup! - I found a bridge to Sara. - Sara's back… And who is this cursed bridge? Stacey Likauko from Binondo. I've had it researched, had it double-checked, she's legit! You know what, man? I doubt it. I don't, man. I'm already here at Lawton, across the post office. Which bridge are you referring to? The bridge heading towards Binondo. There are two bridges heading to Binondo. Which one? Oh! There's two bridges? I didn't know. Stop it. Where should I go? Send me a dick pic first. So what did he say? Oh, dear. He doesn't want to send a photo of his dick. What? Quit it, move over! Sorry, that was Pao texting you earlier. I'm sure. So which bridge are we meeting at? Are you mad at me? I think it's called Jones Bridge. The one heading to the arc of Binondo. That is Jones Bridge. Which lane? Northbound or southbound? What is wrong with him? With all the problems we have in our country, like inflation, poverty, the economy, he's going to add more to the list with all his questions! I don't really care about that. All I want is for him to send a photo of his dick. Can't you just leave and go back to Quiapo? You keep saying nasty things. - It's just a photo. You're too sensitive. - Go ahead. I'll stay here to get some air. Stacey! See, we still got to meet in the middle. Whoo! I thought you were from this area. Why don't you know about the bridge? You never run out of things to say. I'm sorry! So how does this work? Is Sara here? Yes! I'm here! Sara, next time, give me a heads up. You caught me off guard. She says she's here behind me. Okay. Um… I really just have to double-check, okay? Um… I'll ask you questions that you won't find on social media. Is that okay? - You sure it's okay? - Yes, okay! Okay! Where was Sara born? In Tondo, Manila. Near Tutuban. "In Tondo, Manila. Near Tutuban." - Hey! Sara and I are actually neighbors! - Yes, sis! Yes! Okay, last. Where did I propose to Sara? In Baluarte de San Diego, at Intramuros. "In Baluarte de San Diego, at Intramuros." - You guys are so sweet. - Yes! - You are my bridge to Sara! - Yes. - Oh, my God! - Yes, yes! You're hurting me. Let's go to my house. Wait… Wait for me! Wow! This place is big! The curtains automatically open… Your house has two floors! Sara, you didn't tell me that you're rich. Your kitchen is so huge. It's even bigger than my entire house. Sara didn't tell me you guys had such a big house. I'm amazed at your house. Boo-boo? Huh? I'm sorry, I thought I saw… Um… Okay. Make yourself at home. I'll just freshen up. Huh? I know what to do! I'll cook his favorite meal. Steak! Sara! Sara? Where are you? Your house really is nice. It's so fancy. I wonder when - I can have something like this. - Stacey. We have to cook steak. I don't know how make that. Let's just make pancit canton. It's easier to make, and it's delicious! No, it can't be that! It has to be steak. Come on, I'll tell you how to do it. You know, be thankful that you're already dead. 'Cause if you weren't, I'd have killed you. Nathan really loves steak. Medium rare, then add salt, pepper… It's his favorite. So Nathan loves the perfect porterhouse steak. Get the steak from the refrigerator. Refrigerator. You'll see the finest cut of steak you can find here in Manila. Pots and pans. That's the first drawer to the bottom right. There. That one. This? His favorite is basil, thyme, olive oil... Whatever. I'll just use it all! Season the steak. There, you'll need to get the wine. - Which one, Sara? - That one! Yes. You have to flambé the steak. So, pour a little bit. Grab the lighter and then... - My God! Nathan is going to kill me! - Pour water over it! Nathan is going to get so mad! What do I do? - What do I do? I don't know! - What happened? Nathan, I'm sorry! Boo-boo! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Give me the hose! I need the hose! Let me have the hose! I'll be the one to hold it... Smile, honey! It's okay. Happy anniversary! "Smile, honey! It's okay." "Happy anniversary!" Sara says. You almost burned down my place. You're not only a stalker, but an arsonist, too. You're overreacting. The fire went out, didn't it? I'm the one overreacting? Your hands are clean. I dare you to smell them. How was I supposed to know that it wasn't the fire extinguisher I was holding? How does it work exactly? I mean, how are you able to talk to her? Does she possess you? No. She whispers to me, but I don't see her. That's all. Okay, then why can't she talk to me directly? She tried whispering to you before, but you couldn't hear her. Maybe… Maybe you don't have a third ear. You know what that is? Third eye and then third ear. Boo-boo, can we talk? Of course, Boo-boo. "Of course, Boo-boo." Oh, no! Now I'm saying "Boo-boo" because of you two. She says go for it! Boo-boo, do you remember our date in Baluarte de San Diego? Vividly. But we can choose to forget those memories and make new ones. "Vividly, but we…" Sara talks too much. She says to forget about it, instead. Sara? - What should I do? - I could never forget about it. Whoa. Sara? What should... I will never ever forget about it. Sara, what do I do? Nathan's handsome, isn't he? He's not just handsome. He's extremely handsome. He's like an angel who fell from heaven. Look at his eyes, his beautiful nose, and his lips. He's perfect. You talk too much. My goodness, Sara. Now I'm suddenly saying weird things because of you. Boo-boo. Sara, did you hear that? You know, if you talk to him directly, I think he'll move on faster. - I don't think so. - I know Nathan. If he sees me or hears me, it'll be harder for him to move on. Fine. Let's let him sleep. He's not a kid anymore. I felt it. Fast talk! You had sex. This is some exclusive news! No. Hey. I sense some hesitation there. Yeah, right. We did not have sex. But I did hold his thing. How was it? - His thing? - How was it? His thing? His poor, innocent thing! Hey. So, cousin, that girl didn't even do anything… What's her name again? - Sara! - Sara? Even with what happened between you two? Where is she anyway? Hello! I'm here. She's here behind me. Bubbles? She's going crazy. Your family's too judgmental. Don't worry about them. They'll get used to it. Sara, why did you love Nathan? Because he loves like no other. You got so lucky with him. I wish I could be lucky, too. Oh, don't worry. Sooner or later, he'll realize that he can move on to you. Hey! You're such a weirdo! What? Don't you want that? Are you going to deny it? I don't know with you! Look, she's already lost her mind. She's talking to herself. Thank you. Is this seriously where you both like to eat? Don't you like going to nice restaurants? - She doesn't like them. - I don't like them. It's just a bit grimy. You guys don't fit in here. I don't know what it is with Sara, but every time I bring her here, she gets so happy. The food is delicious here. And when you get a taste of it… It's so authentic! It's like you can taste the true spirit and joy of Manila. For her... - Your order, sir. - Thank you. - One chicken feet and one tofu. - Thank you. For her, even if this place serves Chinese food… …she believes that it captures the authentic Manila cuisine. Well… You guys really are a married couple. You guys talk too much. Hold on. Stacey! Don't forget our plan, okay? Right, right. Pao! Cousin! Our plan! Leave it up to me. Relax! Sir, the noodles, please. - Try it. - Okay, I'll try it. Here it is! Mm. This smells good. Good? Yeah. Good? Mmm. - Just keep eating! This is really good. - Okay. It's so spicy. Water! Cousin! Vinegar. This is vinegar! Because vinegar goes well with those dishes! I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to ruin the memories Sara and I have. What are you saying? Look, I'm not stupid, okay? And so are you. I know you know what I'm saying. Are you laughing right now, Sara? Hey! You guys just look so cute together. Whatever you're planning, it won't work. What are you whispering there? Your wife was the one who planned all of this. She even said we look cute together. Okay. Liar! For all I know, she wants you to do something nice, and you choose to fuck things up. - Why would I do that? - I don't know. To take advantage of me? Whoa, hold up! Yeah, I find you attractive, but I'm not that kind of girl. Don't assume so much. Anyway, we're going to some place together. If you ruin it, I'll really be mad at you. Wow, I'm so scared. Sara, help! Okay. It's beautiful, sure, but if it's closed, what's the point? You talk too much. Hold this. Hey! Nathan! We might get caught. - Okay! - Nathan! You got this. Just step on this. Be careful not to get stabbed. Ahh! Now you think I'm Spider-Man? You can do this. Go! - We might get caught... - Your turn. - You're so annoying. - Be careful, okay? - Don't get stuck here. - You know, you're so annoying. - Look out for the guards, okay? - There are none. You're such a headache. It's beautiful here. This place is a testament… To the love Sara and I shared. Right, this is where you proposed. Yeah. When I was here with her… I felt like I could actually reach for the stars. I felt like I was in heaven. When she died… …I didn't just lose a part of me. I lost all of me. My wife… My baby… My family. You guys had a child? Yeah. We had. You know, it breaks my heart that… …both of them are now gone. You really loved her, didn't you? You loved her so much. Isn't it supposed to be that way? Especially with the person that you want to start a family with. I don't know. I've never really had a boyfriend before, just flings. But then I think that you really shouldn't give everything away to the person you love, all of your love and all of yourself, because… What if that person ends up leaving? What will happen to you? What will be left for you? That's exactly what happened with my dad. He gave all of himself to Mom. So when my mother passed away… Nothing was left of my father. That's why I had to step in and take over his responsibilities. And that's why… I was the one… Who was left with nothing. This is crazy. This suddenly became my moment. Tonight's supposed to be about you. It's fine. At least I'm getting to know you more. You're actually pretty deep. - You underestimate me. - I mean it! Of course I have depth. Do you still think I'll find a new love? Of course! What are you talking about? I believe… That the world doesn't run out of love. Even if love is taken away from you, a new one is bound to arrive. You just need to have faith in love. - Hey, you're not allowed to be here. - Sorry, sir. Sorry! Come on, let's go home. - Sorry, sir. We're leaving now. - Sorry. Let's go. - Thank you! - Thank you. Just choose from the pile so that we can make some sales. Stacey! Why are you ignoring me? Stacey! Hey! Nathan. You're acting silly. Don't you feel awkward about what happened between us back at Intramuros? Something happened at Intramuros? You should've booked a room. You guys are so cheap. - Okay, look, nothing happened between us. - It's not what you think. What, you feel awkward just because of that? What? Do you feel awkward? I need to talk to Sara, okay? Sara? I need to talk to her. Boo-boo? Boo-boo! Is she here? I have to talk to her. Okay? Sara! You really want to talk to Sara, huh? - Yes. - Then come here, follow me. See? They left again. Where do you think they are going? Stacey, where are we? Why are we here? You're looking for Sara, right? She's here? What? Why are we here? - Come on, we'll look for Sara. - Stacey… Stacey, enough, okay? I also want to know where Sara is. That makes two of us. Maybe she's here. Let's look for her. Do you want to check? Sara? Sara! Not here. Maybe she's hiding on the other side. Do you want us to check? Sara? Sara! - Stacey, that's enough. - Show yourself. Stop! Still nothing. Here… Sara? - Sara, please, show yourself! - Stacey, that's enough. - Please! - Stacey, stop, please. Sara! Nothing! There's really nothing. - She's really not... - Just stop it. Nathan, we won't find Sara because she's dead. No matter where we look for Sara, we won't find her, because she's gone. But I'm here. I'm helping you move on. Who said that I wanted to move on? What for? For me? What if I told you that I'm starting to fall for you? I'm so stupid. I'm competing with the dead. Stacey, are you expecting me to return the favor? 'Cause I can't. Okay, fine. Nathan, can you please move on already? At least do that. So that whoever will love you next… Will not feel the pain that I feel now. Dad, we're going to school. - There they are. - It's them. Let's go. Uncle! Why are you here? Wanna use my daughter to get to your wife? And then what? Who will you use next? Me? I'm really sorry for what I did, but I would like to talk to Stacey. No! Cousin. Why are you here, Nathan? Look, Stacey, I'm really, really sorry if you have… It's okay. Me, too. I'm sorry if… That's what I felt. I'm also sorry that I can't return the favor. Is it okay for you to still be my bridge to Sara? No, definitely not! - No, no! - That's not allowed! Sis, don't do it! - No! - Stacey! Sis, don't! You know, this is really hard for me… But okay! But on my terms! Okay? You will still get to talk to and be with Sara… Hey, isn't she... …but you will do everything that I want, which is also what Sara wants. Which is? To move on. The first step in moving on is to do a home makeover. Once you change things up, you'll feel differently about everything. We will go through the things in this house one by one. Oh. Hey! You have to go through your things one by one, and ask yourself, "Does this spark joy to help me move on?" If not, then let it go. So, part of moving on is going to new places so that you'll gain a new perspective on life. How am I supposed to get a new perspective on life… …if we're going to be looking at really old stuff? You really talk too much. Can't you just listen to me? I mean, to Sara. Excuse me? Yes? Do you know Monico? Stacey! Monika! Monico? It's Monika now, spelled with a "K." Monika Lhuilliey! - Hip hip, hooray! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! For you to attract good luck and avoid bad luck, do this! This will help you move on. Ah! Hey, it stinks! We have to check every corner of this house. Boo-boo? Boo-boo! Do we really have to do this? She says to go ahead. We, at the Palacio de Memoria, take pride in housing our nicest memorabilia from our glorious past. We present Manila in a deep way, but also in a modern context. Let's proceed. This way. You know so much, Monico! All right, thanks! Bro! Delos Reyes Foods is with us again. They're back. Nathan, Nix, come on! It's for good luck! So, you auction out the things in here? You let go of them just like that? Nathan, we don't just simply let go of the items here. We give it to the best auctioneer. How about the memories? Its sentimental value? Will it go away just like that, too? Nathan, the only thing that will change is how these things will be taken care of by their new owners. But the memories will always be there. They're not going anywhere. - You're really good. - Did you actually doubt it? Stacey, don't! Okay. Sorry. Hey! I never knew you played the piano so well. Play a song for me. Come on. Okay. ♪ I will ride with you ♪ ♪ With whatever you may want ♪ ♪ I will ride with you ♪ ♪ As long as you will ride with me, too ♪ - This is not right. - Come on, Nathan. This is the last step! Okay, so this is what you call moving on? No. This is what you call letting go. Now, let's go. It's really here, in Manila Bay, where you'll find the best sunsets in the whole wide world. She asked me to come here that day. She told me that she had a surprise for me. We were supposed to have a delicious dinner, then she said she had good news to share. Had I known that it was going to be the most painful news I could ever receive… If only I'd known, I would've gone to Quiapo instead of her. Then she'd still be here. I could've still had a family. Remember what I told you back in Quiapo… About being able to empathize with you? It's because I know the feeling, too. I know what it's like… To get your hopes up. To think that maybe someday… All the pain will just go away… And the sadness, too. But, Nathan, believe me, you feel that way because… You continue to hold on to something that you should've let go of a long time ago. I don't want to let go of Sara. Even if you let her go, it doesn't mean you're erasing your feelings. Nathan, sometimes, the most painful yet most beautiful love… …is to let go. Nathan, it's time to let go of Sara. You deserve to be happy. You deserve to love, to be loved. I'm sure that's what Sara would've wanted for you. You need to live again, Nathan. Let her go here. Right here, where it hurts the most for you. Unpropose to her. What? What do you mean? Nathan, we had a deal. You said you'd do what I tell you to do. Now kneel. Just say everything you said when you proposed to Sara. Nathan. No. Come on, Nathan. Nathan, come on. This is your chance to let Sara go. Sara Lustre… …for more than ten years, you have been the love of my life. I promise you… From now until death do us part, I will fight for our love. Will you unmarry me, Boo-boo? Okay. Can I… Can I hug you? You know, for… For Sara? Okay. - You seem happy. - Should I not be? Did you bring our beta application that we rushed to finish? Yeah, man. At least you're really back in the game. But if Sara is making you do this, please don't stop. It's not Sara, man. It's Stacey! Wait. So the app that you rushed to make, it's for her? Yes. You know what? I think… That Sara is leading me to Stacey. You think so? And I'm starting to like her. Dude… …just make sure of it. It'll be bad if you're falling for Stacey …just 'cause she's your bridge to Sara. She's more than just a bridge. She's like Sara, but a new Sara. You are one big, fat liar! - You got Nathan to do all of that? - Yes. I was able to push him to move on. Without Sara. Yes. Besides, that's what she wanted, right? So that makes us both happy. Wherever she may be. You're crazy! You lied to Nathan! Well, if it's for his own good… What's wrong with that? I can really feel it. I'm going to be lucky today. Really, Uncle? Definitely! Check out this Scratchlt card! 5,000. Nice! Nice one, Dad! Hi, Nathan. You're dressed just like Sara. Yeah, I am. I was asking her for some fashion tips, and she gave me some. You were going to show me something? Nix and I developed a beta app for your online store… …so that your business can expand. Thanks for dinner, Nathan! Nix! - Hey, what's up, bro? - Hey. Hi, guys! - How are you? - Nix, Nathan, what's this? Uh, I thought of updating the name of your store. You know, for easier marketing and promotion. And speaking of the app… Nix, take it away. We already launched the full version of the Luck On app. But we will need some help in maintaining the server. Your customer demand has already increased. Thank you very much, Nathan. - This is big for us. - Thank you, too, sir. So, guys, want me to teach you how to use the app? Yeah! Let's go! Teach us! - Don't forget to say thank you! - You should give me your number. Thanks, Nathan. You made them happy. Are you happy? Yes. This is pretty cool. At least I have an advance birthday gift. - Birthday? - Mmm-hmm. Why didn't you mention it earlier? No reason, we were just eating and… Well, I wanted to tell you just now. Besides, my birthday isn't until Thursday. How about this? Um… Let's celebrate tomorrow. Let's do something special? What? Where? I'll do the planning. I'll pick you up tomorrow night. Is that okay with you? Wow! You even have a table. I just borrowed that. Someone helped me out. We're going to watch something. - Mmm? - Mmm. I hope you'll like it. What's that? Do you know this movie? Hey! This is my favorite! Honey, Am I in Heaven? - This is actually my favorite. - Really? Mmm-hmm. Will you marry me? Of course, I will! I'm so excited to get married. Here you go. Wow. Thank you! Sir, sir! We will get hit! Are you happy? Huh? What kind of question is that? Of course I'm happy, because my family is. But my question is, are you happy? Come on, you can tell me. Tell me already. - Liars go to hell. - So just say it. Maybe… I just don't know… How long I can keep lying to myself… By saying that I'm happy just because my family is. Okay. What… What makes you sad, then? So that I know how to make you happy. Wow. Um… When will it be my turn? When… It won't be all about my family anymore. That's it. All my life… I have always put them first. As long as they're okay, I'm okay. What I want doesn't really matter. I love my family, but sometimes I think… That I love them too much, to the extent that they become my whole world. So that's why… I'm not able to experience living my own life. I've accepted the fact that I may not have any relationships, and that I'll just take care of my family. When it comes to my love life, I just have no luck. Maybe you need a new type of love. Maybe… …it's time you got a boyfriend. You're making me fall for you, aren't you? Of course not! Especially not for the one who made me fall in love again. You know what, let's just enjoy this moment. It's your birthday, anyway. Cheers! I forgot this elevator was under maintenance. Can you take the stairs to the penthouse? Oh, no. Are you sure? Of course! This is nothing. - It's just 47 floors. Come on! - All right. Let's go. Hey! Are you serious? It's only the 10th floor, and you're already tired? Come on, you can do this! You still good? Of course. I was first. I'm thirsty. Wait, I need to put this here. Nathan, you're making me nervous. Be careful. Are you okay? Let me see. It's just a cramp. It's fine. Look, this is nothing. Are you sure? Be careful. I got you. Oh! Boo-boo. Thank you! Yes. She's here! She's here! Happy birthday! Hey! What happened... - Stacey! - Stacey! Stacey? - Sis. - Sis. Stacey. What is it? What did Nathan do to you again? Nothing. Nathan hasn't done anything to us. I'm the one who did something wrong to him. Sara isn't here anymore. I can't hear her anymore. I've been pretending to hear her, but I haven't heard her whisper in a long time. I did it because I didn't want to lose Nathan. I love him, that's why I did all this. But why do I feel like… I'm ruining his family with Sara, even if Sara isn't here anymore, and their child isn't here, either? I understand. I understand because you once helped me, too. When my world fell apart after your mother passed away, you took over all the responsibilities that were supposed to be mine. You had good intentions. You just wanted to help Nathan move on. But you know… After what happened to our family, I realized that it's hard to move on. You cannot force it or rush it. Moving on is like healing a wound. To treat a wound… You need to give it time to fully heal. You still have time. You still have a chance to fix all of this… And to let Nathan and yourself heal. We love you, sis. Stacey Likauko… …I know that you like me and… I want to take this to the next level. Would you be my girlfriend? Hey! I thought you weren't coming. You left without saying goodbye. Nathan, we should stop seeing each other. Huh? Did I do something wrong? We were just fine last night. I'm the one who did something to you. I lied to you. Since the first time we went to Baluarte… Sara hasn't been here. I don't hear her anymore. She's gone. Okay, so all of that… Everything you did was just for show? It was all you, not because of Sara? Nathan, I only did it because I love you. Okay. What's so funny? I said, what's so funny? - Hey. - It's funny. No, it's funny. Why? Look, Stacey, I… Stacey, I'm finally sure. I'm finally sure that I love you. No… No. What's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what I just said? I said… I lied to you. Do you deserve that? You think you can love someone who lied to you? Stacey, I… Stacey, I understand, okay? Look, I understand you lied to me, but… No one deserves to be lied to. But that lie… led me to this. Yeah, that lie led me to this. It led me to you. Okay? It led me to us. - Please stop. - Wait. - I don't care, okay? - Nathan, can't you hear yourself? - I really don't care. - You don't understand! - I lied to you! - Can't you see fate is bringing us together? - Sara brought us together. - No! Sara brought us together. Stacey… Okay, all I care about… Is I want to be with you. Okay? I want to be with you. I know you love me, and I love you, too. That's all that matters to me. I lied to you. Please, please, Stacey. I can't. That's not true, Nathan. I already lost Sara and I can't lose you, too, okay? See? Please, let's just end this. You're just saying that because you see Sara in me.
