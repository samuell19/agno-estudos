Good night, Mrs. Kauffmann. Shh... I'm here. Shh... Shh... Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! DANISH EMBASSY WASHINGTON D.C. And who is this handsome stranger? And who is this dashing woman? Morning. Children! Let's get ready for President Roosevelt. Mr. Ambassador, please. THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON D.C. Ambassador Henrick Kauffmann and family. Mr. President. - My credentials. - Thank you. And Mr. President, allow me to deliver a personal greeting from his majesty King Christian X of Denmark. The King has asked me to pass on to you his wish for the unbreakable friendship between the United States of America and Denmark. His majesty also sends his best wishes for you, sir, and your family. It is my great pleasure to receive you and your family and there is Charlotte. Oh, ho, ho. Come here. Well it must be, what, ten years since I last saw you? Too long. These are the girls. Look at these lovely... Oh, thank you, lovely young ladies. You know, your father talks about them every time I see him. You know Grandpa? Mm-hm. The admiral's an old friend of mine. Now, it's martini time. I am so happy to have you finally back in Washington. We have been dreaming about it for ten years, ever since Peking. Not only on account of the family, America has been on my wish list for a long time, especially now with the current political situation that goes on in Europe. Oh, by the way, I met your sister last week. I haven't seen Zilla for two years. - Thank you. - Well, Mr. Ambassador, to our wonderful wives. Cheers! Oh, there's lemonade for the children. Come with me, girls. Here you are, Lisa. These are bleak times in Europe. Hitler's at Poland's border, Denmark could be next. The concern is, what if the Germans cross our borders, where do the Americans stand if that happens? Denmark would have our utmost sympathy. So the guardian of freedom would watch passively if Hitler attacks a small and innocent neighboring country? We would object. Vehemently. I'm very curious as to your own personal opinion on Denmark's neutral stance. Is that a wise strategy, do you think? It's a very good question. But it's the kind of question I discussed at my security council. For heaven's sake, what's the matter? Franklin liked you. Yes, the way a father liked his daughter's prom date. If I ignore him, she might not fuck him. Oh, Henrick, you're being vulgar. There will be war, you know. The Americans will do nothing when the Germans attack. But if anyone is going to get them to do something, it will be you. I can't get what I want if Roosevelt considers me a small fish. Well you are right about that. What do you mean I'm right? But you're a small, colorful fish. Not a boring gray herring who swims in a shoal. A clownfish you mean? Yes. But a flashy one. Trust me. I've known Franklin a long time. Girls you were fabulous, everyone was so proud... He only brought down unemployment by hiring more military personnel. - Unemployment is the lowest in years. - Because they're all in the military. The German unemployment is at an all-time low. The motorways are the only upside... If the Germans come, they will steamroll Denmark. All we can do is stay neutral. You want to leave the fight to others? If everybody thinks like you, Hitler will win the war. It's not that simple. Denmark's neutralist policy is a delicate thing. No, it's a disgrace! It allows people like you to refrain from taking a stand. There are many considerations. We can't jeopardize our friendship with Germany. Why don't we just lean back and let Hitler take over Europe? Stick to your deeds and wills and leave the international politics to us. Well... What's go into you? Things are getting too heated now. What a temper. Blechinberg, schedule a meeting with him as soon as possible. All right. - Mrs. Ambassador. - Oh! Zilla! Zilla, Zilla, Zilla! You're here. And girls, Poppin, let me look at you. You're so big. Girls, why don't you take Poppin to see your bedroom? Now let me see you. My god, you look younger. Can you give me a bit of whatever it is you're taking? Oh... and sex on a regular basis. Zilla, it's so good to see you. Charlotte, I have something for you. You know how I love cranberry juice. And you know how I love cosmopolitans. Henrick, come and say hello to Zilla. Look, she brought us cranberry juice. I'm going to fix us some cosmopolitans. It's so lovely to see you again, Zilla. Nice to see you too, Henrick. You have a lovely house. I adore the garden. Charlotte said it was tiny, but I think it's perfect. You look beautiful. - Yes. - Attorney Povl Band-Jensen is here. Show him in. Thank you, Amo. - I'm glad you could come. - I think I know why I'm here. - You do? - You want an apology for the other day. - I don't give a damn about apologies. - Good. I didn't intend to offer one. Splendid. That settles all the hypothetical situations. - A drink? - No thanks. You remind me of myself when I was young. - I find that very hard to believe. - Oh, yes. Lots of energy. Lots of anger. Why are you so angry. Mankind is about to perform collective suicide. The evil is unfathomable- and the Danes think they can hide behind their neutrality as always. Hear, hear. - What do you propose we do? - Choose sides! Resist! I'm going back to join the army. Oh? To get shot? I fail to see the perspective. Sit down. Don't stand there fluttering. - I think you'd make a good diplomat. - Oh. Nah. I have better things to do than go to garden parties and drink champagne. Do you know what happens to diplomacy during a war? It becomes redundant. By no means, but it does change its nature. The diplomat's role becomes more fluid, which makes it possible to act. - If Germany invades Denmark... - When Germany invades Denmark. When Germany invades Denmark, yes. The King and the government will flee- and the fight will mainly be fought from here. Through a government... in exile. Perhaps. With all the other embassies. Do you really think I became a diplomat just to drink champagne? Well, I don't know. You seem to be good at it. The world is wide open now. I'll admit it looks bleak. But it's also an opportunity to change the state of things. In the future, we must adopt a more international outlook. Look to America. When the war comes, which it will, I will need someone like you. It was Poppin who was so desperate for me to buy the thing. And already, during its second race, has an accident, breaks its leg, just did a somersault. And the jockey, the little guy? Is flung off like a cannonball. Poppin was devastated, of course. - Oh, poor jockey. - No, poor horse. - Poor Poppin. - Poor me, it was my damn money. Look at Henrick over there. Just draining Mason of all his money. He hasn't lost money on his projects, though, has he? Oh god, no. You know Henrick. It's always win-win. Contrary to my husband, who's lose-lose. I got the beautiful one and you got the good one. He comes late from the Senate... smelling of new perfume. Oh Zilla. I'm sorry. Forget about it. I've learned to choose my own mood. You can do that? Choose your own mood? Want me to teach you? Sure. Have a little sip of your drink. Now take a bigger sip. The senate is at a loss, like the rest of the United States. And if I'm being perfectly honest, I don't know where I stand either. You can't pressure Hitler if you're not willing to employ the military. Mommy, who do you love the most, Dad or Zilla? Oh, both. I love them both equally. - And you, and Tilda. - And Poppin? Mm-mm. Of course I love Poppin. In fact, if it wasn't for Poppin, I would never have met your father. If I hadn't gone out to China, I would never have met him and you two wouldn't exist. We probably would have dragged him back home to you in any case. That's true, you had already decided we were getting married. You certainly didn't object. Oh, I suppose they're right. Tell us more about China? Oh come along girls, I think it's time for bed. Oh, spoil sport. No, no, no, we can't do that. We were on a secret mission. We were spies. Really? It's the Gobi Desert. Can you hear them? The warriors from the plain are lying for us in wait for us over there. The horses were trained so they were completely silent in the night. Henrick, send a share of lead in their direction. Girls? You promise not to tell? We'll teach you our secret spy code. - Come on Daddy! - Mommy, come on! - Let's go. - Come on, teach us. Uh, excuse me. Come on. - Why did you stop? - Let's go Aunt Zilla. Mama! - Good Mr. Ambassador. - Good night, Vera. Thank you, good night. Don't make this more difficult than it already is. It's been a long day. Yes. I suppose you're right. - Good night, darling. - Good night. ...that we are not town and country. We are not workers. Clerks... ...our soldiers are not the enemy. but friends- solely here to protect the Danish neutrality. - Danish Embassy. - Nate Porter, New York Times. Can I please have a comment from the legation about the German invasion of Denmark? Hello? Hello? Can I get a comment from the legation, please? - Did the government flee? - It's still in the country. - Any fighting? - Two hours at the German border. Losses? - Embarrassingly few. - They didn't stand a chance. They had a chance to show we're not a Nazi satellite. - The American press is hounding us. - No comments. Is the government dissolved? No. They're negotiating with the Germans. They aim to keep ruling the country with Danish police and Danish courts of law. But in the presence of the Nazi military. The government urges everyone to remain loyal. - Any orders from Foreign Affairs? - None other than that telegram. Perhaps it's the best solution. Collaborating with the Nazis is both stupid and tragic. Try to get in touch with them again - and ask the other Danish embassies around the world how they are proceeding. Would you do that now? Yes. - So the Kind didn't flee? - No. There won't be any government-in-exile and they're negotiating with the Nazis. Yes. We'll declare ourselves independent. But an embassy can't do that? We won't take orders from a government without a free will. We certainly won't. I'll be recalled immediately. I certainly will. Well, we don't want to go home. Operator, how can I help you? Can you connect me to Denmark please? - Yes. - Ministry of Foreign Affairs? - Henrik? - Speaking. What's going on, Nils? Hello? MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS COPENHAGEN XXX their occupation is not hostile. - Not hostile? - The government stays. We're neutral. We'll save our democracy. It doesn't look like that from here. I'm reluctant to take orders from a ministry operating at gunpoint. That's not the case. We want things to go smoothly. Both the King and the government agree on this policy. But I was sent here by a free Denmark. Henrik, listen. We've been given an ultimatum: Surrender or Copenhagen will be wiped out. Do you understand? Do you understand? Hello? Henrik? I'm considering declaring myself independent. ...independent. You're considering - defying the King and the government and betraying your country? Do you grasp the severity of the situation? The connection is poor. Nils, talk to you later. - Hello! - Hello... Henrik! It was about dawn this morning that the first reports came in saying the German troops are crossing the frontier into Denmark. The Department for Foreign Affairs WASHINGTON D.C. There seems to have been little opposition. Mr. Kauffmann, the Danish Ambassador, Excuse me. Now you sure gave up quick. Denmark is a small country. - Kauffmann, good to see you. - Likewise. So, I'm considering establishing an independent embassy here in the United States to represent the king and the free Danish people. Let me get you a drink. Your country's just been occupied, please. It's no good to have a Danish foreign policy that is run under pressure by the Nazis. It's also in the interest of the United States to oppose that situation. Will the United States support me? Recognize you as all of Denmark's government. Your government is still operational in Denmark, Kauffmann and as far as we know they're in the process of making an arrangement with the occupying force That arrangement is made under coercion. It seems voluntary to us. We will not be dragged into someone else's war. I'm sorry. The German army and navy is now responsible for Denmark's safety. Avoid any passive or active resistance. Hey, Dad. Hi, Dad. Oh, Mrs. Hart, can you take the bags out the other way? This is not a good time.. Vera Could you take them out, please? Come on out, please quick. So... Is there something I should know? The Danish government is negotiating with the Germans. But that means taking orders from the Nazis. Yes. The alternative is to distance us from the government line. Well if I don't get support from the Americans, they will send me back to Denmark. They'll never do that. There's a war. The United States doesn't want to get involved in anything. And if Denmark demands that I'm extradited, America might be in trouble if they don't follow the order. But you cannot support Nazism, that's impossible. I know. Do you remember what you used to tell me about diplomacy? You would say it's fifty percent information and fifty percent gambling. So... Gamble. Catch. I came to this country. To represent my king and a free and independent people. That is what I'm still here for. Democratic and peaceful Denmark has had to bow for overwhelming force. The Danish government is now under German duress. And as a consequence, I will no longer take orders from Denmark. My country is going through dark days. It has done so before. We did not lose courage then and we will not lose courage now. I will work for one thing only. The re-establishment of a free independent Denmark. Many will work with me and I know we shall succeed. Oh, my darling, I'm so proud of you. You too. Amo, bring us some coffee, please. - Any news? - Svenningsen. - Good grief. - Goodbye. That was Copenhagen. Svenningsen, the minister, they're all furious. We got these telegrams from the other embassies. The Danish ambassador in Moscow is calling you a traitor. - Full backing from Iran. - And from the ambassador in Argentina. Brazil... Mexico is behind us. Full backing from Egypt, Portugal - and from Japan. Nine embassies. Not many out of the 24 embassies who replied. - Surely that's enough to pave the way. - Absolutely. - Thank you, Miss Lauring. - Thank you, Mr. Kauffman. OK, time to leave. Telegram from Svenningsen. Come. Girls, out. Svenningsen demands that we acknowledge the Danish government and the Nazi agreement, or he'll send a new ambassador immediately. It's crucial to come under American protection now. How do we manage that? I can't get through to Roosevelt, you know. I need your help, Charlotte, please get me access to him. It's going to cost you. I'm very sorry to use your family connections like that. It's Aunt Zilla and Poppin. Hi Poppin, hi Aunt Zilla. Hmm. What's happening in that little tiny little head. Can I see? Yes. Mr. President, I need you to support the embassy's independence. I had a hunch you were going to bring that up. If you'd allow me to offer you a humble piece of advice. Please. With me unopposed you'll have a collaborating partner. One willing to fight for the same things as you do. Since you seem to know what we want, why don't you pass by the Senate one day and let us know. Apparently we don't. I might just do that. Truth is the American people is not interested in the European War. They don't want to die for countries they've put behind them. But surely they'll die for the idea that America is built on. Yes ideas provide a spur, a jolt of energy, but when it really comes down to it. Nobody will fight and die for a notion. In the end... there's a resource always. A prize. Piece of land. Golden treasure. I think you... I give up. I give up. A woman. What about self-defense? Europe is too far away, Americans don't feel threatened. If Britain sinks and Germany makes it across the channel, you will be. The Nazis are not going to stop in Europe. And you'll be squeezed by the Japanese on the other side. If one didn't know better, I might be inclined to think that you were trying to send the United States into war to protect your own unilateralism against the wishes of your government. You... have a problem, Mr. Kauffmann. I know. I'd like a coffee now. Would you mind giving me a push? - Franklin? - Mm-hm? Do you remember those cakes that you used to enjoy when you come to visit us on the base Oh Zilla's cakes? They were legendary. You see. Charlotte is mad because I got all the glory. I... I'd Knock myself out with all the eggs and then spices and then the guests would fall over themselves saying Zilla, you're so talented and I did all the work. Zilla would saunter in at the end and decorate them with frosting and berries. This way, girls. - And I loved your dancing. - Thank you. Come along, hurry up. Franklin, thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. There's one thing I can't fathom. Are you trying to save yourself or the whole world? What's the difference? Very well. I will let your government know that we will be skeptical if they try to replace you. And that we do believe they're being coerced by the Nazis. And should gain you a little time. Thank you very much. Mr. President. Thank you. It's like we're on a big pile of snow. I just want to thank you Charlotte. Such a wonderful gesture, thank you. I'm so glad you're satisfied. Yes. We definitely have a modicum of security now. It was a very, very successful meeting. - Was it fun at the president's? - Yes. Do you like my new hairstyle? - I love it. - Eh, it's ok. It's too soapy. Yeah, I think so, too. Whoops. What the hell is the matter with you? What's the matter with me? I'll tell you what's the matter with me Henrick. My husband kissing my sister. We've been back here six months and that's what you decide to do, hmm? My sister and don't try to deny it. I saw you. Is there still something between you two? That was a long time ago. I think you'll find it was approximately four hours ago Henrick. And it was a mistake. I apologize. You're goddamn, right it was a mistake. Zilla. Of all people. Are you trying to take her away from me? No, I'm not trying to take your sister away from you, Charlotte. I'm not trying to take anyone away from you. Because you can't. I won't let you. And I'm not trying to... I tell you. Don't. You're my wife. You can't let a moment of foolishness come between us. Tilda, get out. It's OK, sweetheart. I knew something had happened between you a long time ago, but I was foolish enough to believe it was over. It was nothing and it is over. When was it? Hmm? Was it during the terrible Chiang Kai-shek? Stop it. Huh? Or was it when the fearsome Mongolian soldiers were standing outside your tents or did you see her across the campfire in the Gobi desert braiding her hair and you thought that's the one I want, but unfortunately, she's married to my friend. So I'll just take the sister. I'm going to sleep in the office. Right you are. I declare war on Germany! I declare war on China. Recently, dangerous events have taken place. I declare war on... Germany! The legal authorities must take the necessary steps to protect Danish interests. I declare war on Denmark. If this state of things continues, it will be detrimental to Danish social conditions. This just came in from Denmark. Foreign Affairs is holding back all Danish funds until we change course. Well... They know where to plunge the knife. It also applies to Mexico and Argentina. All the embassies that followed suit are being punished financially. We must support them as best we can. We can't. We haven't got the money. Danish government bonds are plummeting. How will you pay the interest rates? The Americans have frozen all Danish funds. No one will lend us any money. - But we must maintain those payments. - And we will. As soon as we've bought some of the bonds cheap. That's stockjobbing. Yes. The money will go to a good cause. - I want absolutely no part of that! - Nonsense. - Buy some bonds in your own name. - No way! I'll refrain from reporting you. That's how far I'll go. Well, that's something. There are other available funds. Denmark's gold reserve. Denmark's gold reserve? Before the occupation, the government chose to safeguard the gold reserve. - It was sailed to New York. - Seriously. A huge convoy with the gold in the middle. It's now at the Federal Reserve under lock and key. You're going to steal Denmark's gold? The gold of free Denmark. The Americans are never going to let you near that gold. They'd have to recognize you as equal to a government-in-exile. I have an idea. There. Get this out of the way. Draw the world. America here and Europe here. Go on. - America... - And Europe here. - Europe here. - It doesn't have to be accurate. - Spain, Italy... - Spain. Italy. And Norway... and Denmark. Draw all of Denmark. The entire kingdom including Greenland. - Greenland, too? - Greenland, too. - Greenland. - And Iceland. That map poses two problems for Roosevelt. If he can't deliver his airplanes to the Brits, Great Britain will fall. If that happens, Europe will fall to Hitler. But that's not the only problem. What does Greenland have that America wants? Cryolite. For their airplane production. They want to get their hands on the cryolite before the Germans. If we find one solution to those two problems, what do we get? I'm an airplane. I fly from Canada to Greenland. - No problem. - Sure. My only problem is that there's no airport here. And you can't build one because of all the ice. - I'm pretty sure the Americans can. - Yes? So I can fly from Greenland to Iceland on one tank, and then to defend London and bomb the Germans. Do you follow? With bases in Greenland, I control the North Atlantic. When Roosevelt sees that the solution to both his problems is Greenland, then he'll see that he needs me. But the law is clear. Only Greenland's governors can allow bases up there. We'll just have to outmaneuver them. They must realize the gravity of this. - We'll have to be creative. - And we sure are. After the war, America will be a superpower, and with America on our side, nobody will ever dare occupy us again. Period. Holy shit. But Henrik... We haven't got the mandate to strike such a deal. I know. That's why we have to be creative. Find a loophole. - A loophole? - You're the lawyer. - This is treason. - Greenland is our ace. This could be the beginning of the end of Hitler. But Svenningsen.... I repeat: I won't be held accountable for this any longer. Yes, exactly. No, he's acting high-handedly. But Svenningsen... We need a new ambassador. Before we get into matters. I have a small favor to ask you. I have an employee, Blakenburg, he drinks and he is accumulating gambling debt. I have a hunch he's also involved in something criminal. Could you let FBI look into this for me, please? I'll pass his name to Hoover. Goosebumps just mentioning his name. We're actually come to discuss the security of the United States. It doesn't take much imagination to understand that the Americans would like to gain control of the North Atlantic. I believe that we can offer an exchange that would benefit everyone: an air base in Greenland for easy access to Europe. And you have no right of disposal over Greenland Mr. Kauffmann, so you are not a negotiating partner in that manner. I'm sure some agreement could be drawn up. And what type of agreement with that be? Listen. Denmark is occupied. It goes without saying that the Danish Independent Ambassador in the United States is one in charge of Greenland. I'm not sure that the Greenlandic governors would agree with that but... - They don't have the... - to settle this in the best interest of the United States. We can't just steamroll across international law. Who's talking about steamrolling? We just have to think here use our brains a little Povl, control yourself. And we also need to discuss the Danish gold Reserve. - The gold? - Yeah. Access to gold and now you're lecturing me on how to sidestep international law. When does it stop? Gentlemen, it's impossible for me to help you with Greenland or anything else. Now you've already wasted a disproportionate amount of my time with problems that you yourselves have created. Good day. Thank you for your time. - Clumsy oaf! - I've got a migraine. Turn it off. How are you? God's plunging a pencil into my brain. How can we make the Americans strike a deal with us and not the governors? I don't know, Henrik. We're going to be recalled... unless we get the Americans over on our side now. And we'll go to prison. Or get shot. What can the governors give the Americans? A deal. A temporary deal that expires when the war is over. What if we prolong that deal? Yes... Well, we could look into how to revoke a potential deal. Or not revoke. What if I offer the Americans a deal that is not temporary? An irrevocable deal? Yes, so the Americans can keep their bases after the war. You want to let them keep Greenland after the war? For ever. - It's madness. - Yes. I like it. Charlotte, the thing about Zilla... I think we should forget about that. - Yes, but you do know that... - I said. Forget about it. I want things to be as they were. I want you two to be friends again. For God's sake, Henrick. We're sisters, were more than friends. I miss you, Charlotte. You look so silly sitting there. Hm? Tell me what you miss about me. I miss everything about you, you're my wife. - You miss my assistance. - That too. - Denmark needs me? - World peace needs you. You can go. I'm going to fix us a drink. I never meant to hurt you. I know that my darling. German bombers rain fire and high explosive bombs in their most savage attack on London. The British people need tanks and guns and ammunition and supplies of all kinds. This is an emergency... ...as war itself. But unless the advance of Hitlerism is forcibly checked now, the Western Hemisphere will be within range of the Nazi weapons of Destruction. Zilla, buying a house in Washington. It's a wonderful idea. Well it was Charlotte. that noticed it was for sale. Oh? - Good afternoon, - Good afternoon. Ma'am. Mr. President. All it needs is an elevator. Tell you what, why don't you and I go and look at the gardens. Another wonderful idea. - Right this way. - Thank you. I hope that Zilla buys this house. And I hope she never knows mows the lawn. And I can come here. Lie in the long grass and no one will know where I am. Don't you ever feel like just disappearing sometimes? I can keep the secret, if you need to talk. I think Henrick is in love with Zilla. How cruel life is. So humiliating. Jealousy is... just gnawing away at me. Eleanor is in love. With our new female friend. And I'm prepared for her to become engaged. Well, Franklin, I'm also in love with Eleanor. And I'm a little in love with Henrick. I suppose some people just have an ability to suck up love wherever they can. Hm. Maybe they enable us to love them. You ever consider that? Perhaps they're love generators. And maybe it is possible to love more than one person. What if we are not lesser beings because we have to share those we care about. How very modern of you. You know, Franklin. Henrick truly believes that it would benefit world peace if the United States had military bases on Greenland in perpetuity. He thinks as a nation, we really ought to have that. Danish Embassy, Bang-Jensen speaking. Yes. Yes, of course. We'll be there. Thank you. Bye. We fear that Churchill won't be able to hold Great Britain. We do what we can to help the British but our planes aren't getting there fast enough and too many are being destroyed when the carrier ships are being torpedoed. They're growing increasingly devilish, those submarines. We have also received intelligence that the German submarines are getting very close to the east coast of Greenland. And that is one problem. But the larger one is if they set up bases there and weather stations. Weather stations, why is that a problem? Well, reconnaissance bombing raids, concealment of battleship transports the suppression of enemy aircraft activities all of this is impossible without knowledge of the weather. Our British friends would be fighting blind If the British lose than we are forced into the war. What are you going to do? Our people who have had a look at your idea of flying in the planes via Greenland and it is possible to build a runway up there. Roosevelt wants to negotiate an agreement now. So you're reconsidering my offer. But, it must be in accordance with protocol so we would like you to pass this to the Greenlandic governors in Godthab and get them to sign it. Mmm. Hmm. Look at this article 10 this agreement shall remain in force until it is agreed by the parties that the present dangers to the peace and security of the American continents have passed. Such an agreement in reality is irrevocable. It's high treason. For the governors in Greenland. It's punishable by death during wartime. You'll never convince the governors to go along with that. No, but by all means let's send it up there. See what they say. You can negotiate with the governors yourself. Good luck with that. Gentlemen, we need Greenland before the Nazis set foot up there. Absolutely. Then I suggest that you make an agreement with the governors that's only for the duration of the war. We can't just hand back air force bases because some war ends. No, that is a problem. That is indeed a problem. Or perhaps Roosevelt needs a better negotiating partner. Who sees the bigger picture. You'd sign this. I'll sign this. And when I sign it I want the United States to recognize me as the only official representative of the free Denmark. I and only I represent the king At the same time, I want the Danish state's frozen funds revenue from Rekilad mine and the Danish gold reserve to be at my disposal. You give us those bases then everything is possible. This is a five-star agreement. The United States has taken custody of Greenland for the Danes. I'm happy on behalf of the occupied Danish people, to be able to offer this contribution to the defense of the free world. Mr. President. Turn here please. Mr. President. Come on, in you go. Mr. Kauffmann, welcome to the Federal Reserve. - Thank you. - Follow me, please. - Well... - Wow. Do you know what this is? The Danish gold? Money? - Dollars. - Mmm. Lisa? This... is peace in the world. And whoever tells you that you can have peace without the money, don't trust them. Whoever has the money wins. So are we going to win now. That is exactly what's going to happen. - The embassy in Mexico. - Mexico. - Iceland. - Iceland. - And South Africa. - South Africa. - The Egyptian Embassy and Iran. - Egypt and Iran. - Portugal. - Portugal. Brazil. And... - Canada. - Canada. This is the last pile. It ought to tide them over for at least three months. Henrick. I was just helping Charlotte with her charity. How's that going? Good, I got 10,000 from the Barnens today. How wonderful, beautiful. - And you? - As long as we can support the independent embassies around the world, we're satisfied. Good. Come here. Sit with me, come. Come Zilla, sit down. Ow. - Ow. - Oh, stop fussing. Ow, I don't want braids. Nonsense. It looks so nice. - Ow. - I said stop fussing. - Ow! - Mom, let her go. Oh for heaven's sake. Get out. Now. And I promise you this is the best lobster money can buy. Did you catch this yourself, Charlotte? ...controversial topic. Do you mind if I try to cut your finger now? I mean you can try. Oh, no. Oh no. Now it's stuck. You have to... Let her go. It'll have to be my wedding ring. I'm free! Excuse me. Excuse me. What is the matter Charlotte. I just keep thinking about what it was like when it was just the two of us just... Henrick and I. God I would have followed that man to the ends of the Earth. Bit like you and I as children. Invincible. I felt so strong back then. You are strong. You're the strongest person I know. No. - I have lost all my magic. - Charlotte. I can see why he's in love with you. Don't be silly. Henrick loves you. You're very beautiful. I want you to tell me what happened in China. What is there to tell? We were young. I was in love with Mason. I was in love with myself Were you in love with Henrick? No. We had a friendship nothing more than that. Why don't I believe you? Stop this Charlotte, immediately. What are you doing? We were just goofing around, girl talk. - Let's get back to the party. - Yeah. Whether it's right or wrong, who knows? - Is everything OK? - Just a little dizzy. Sweet little Poppin came to see if her Aunt Charlotte was all right. Have a glass of water, dear. It's nothing. That's some champagne won't fix. Arno, can we have some champagne please? Champagne, that could be your motto, Charlotte. The lobster was fantastic. Well, you should have mine, I don't want it. Girls, how was your lobster? - It was lovely. - Delicious I was thinking perhaps we visit the Regatta this weekend bring... Yes? Good evening. Sorry to disturb. We have received orders from Foreign Affairs that can't wait. - If you'd step outside with me. - No, go ahead and read it out loud. "As you without authority and in defiance of the constitution... have signed and agreement with America regarding the defense of Greenland... you are by royal resolution dismissed as Denmark's ambassador in Washington." "Furthermore, you are charged with high treason, in accordance with sections 89, 99 and 103 of the Penal Code, carrying a possible life sentence." "A warrant for your imprisonment has been issued and you will forfeit your personal fortune." "The management of the embassy will be in the hands of Einar Blechingberg." "Return to Copenhagen immediately." Obviously I'm lost, what did the man say? He saying that I have to step down from my position and go to Copenhagen. For short period of time. I don't believe this. As it says, I'm to take over the management of the embassy. We have to leave for the airport. I've informed Berle. You are pathetic. - No, no, no. - I'm coming with you. No, no, no, Charlotte. You're not. You're not. You stay here. Will you let me know what's happening? Sit down. I'll take care of it. Your family will be sent off later. I'll take care of them personally. What's going on? Read for yourself. Amo, bring the car round. We're leaving for the airport immediately. If you want to pack a few belongings, you have five minutes, of course. - Thank you for remaining calm. - I'm going with you. No, stay here and look after my family. - No, we fall together, Henrik. - Arno. Do you want me to bring the car round? Just do as he says. It's nothing personal. Arno, let Mr. Kauffman out of the car. Berle. You've been deported. You will be flown to New York and put on a ship bound for Lisbon. But you can't do this. The Danish government has told me to take over the embassy. It's a copy of the FBI file on you, Einar. We'll settle your debt with your creditors. You'll get a severance pay so you can settle in Denmark. It's nothing personal. Thank you, Berle. Calvin. Now those damned Americans had better enter into the war! We will interrupt our program to give you latest news bulletin. From the NBC newsroom in New York, President Roosevelt said in a statement today, that the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii from the air. I'll repeat that, President Roosevelt says that the Japanese have attacked... December 7th 1941. A date which will live in infamy. I ask that the Congress declare a state of war between the United States and the Japanese empire. Prime minister Winston Churchill arrived in Washington, for his fifth wartime conference with President Roosevelt and a discussion of plans for the next moves against the axis... President Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill are meeting at the White House to build the foundation for World Peace. Ah, Kauffman. Winston, this is Denmark's, oh, I'm sorry, free Denmark's ambassador. Quite an honor, Mr. Churchill. I get so peckish at night. Mr. President, again I'm so sorry about Pearl Harbor. It was an unpardonable act. At least the allies are now one unified force. I like you Mr. Kauffman. You should have cognac, Kauffman, help yourself to a glass. Thank you. Have a seat. Wow, Gentlemen. Cin-cin. Cin-cin. Mm. Here's the text of the Declaration of the United Nations and I was just explaining to Roosevelt how this could be an efficient military organization. I am very pleased that you find Denmark to be a natural part of this organization. That's a pretty picture actually. In Copenhagen. your government is indulging the Germans. And here you are wanting to join the allies. I heard a boxing match on the wireless the other day. - Jack vs. Montgomery. - Montgomery, yeah. When Jack loses on knock out, the commentator screams, "Jack Ruses rolls over like a Dane." We have soldiers and officers fighting on the side of the Allies. There are also Danes fighting for the Nazis. When the Danish rolled over without a fight the whole world was watching you Kauffman. You know to the American people, I must tell you. being a Dane... is being a coward. The United Nations is not a gathering for cowards, Kauffman. It's for nations who want to come together with the allies and resist barbarism. And Churchill and I, we want you to sign this declaration. I know. But if you want to join the United Nations, you need to convince the world that Denmark is with us and not the Nazis. Thank you for the advice. Gentlemen, good night. My fellow countrymen. The stance of official Denmark has since the occupation of Denmark, been a source of increasing unrest and concern. We are well aware... of the coercion that the government of Denmark is subject to. However small a concession may seem, once given, it will be followed by concession, upon concession, until, like Denmark today, you find yourself in a position where the future of the country is at stake. That Denmark had difficulty offering much military opposition... can to some extend be conveyed to the public opinion of the free world. But it won't be excused by people of those democracies, who are themselves sacrificing everything, if compared to them... Denmark appears spineless and impotent against the occupying force. Best wishes for the future, Henrik Kauffman, Ambassador in Washington. Welcome. My fellow countrymen, dear friends. Thank you for coming. We all have family in Denmark, and we worry about how they will make it through the war. So we've invited you here today to ask you to think about how Denmark will fare after the war. What will Denmark's legacy be? Well, no legacy at all, as far as I can see. Present company excluded, of course. As my wife so clearly expresses, Denmark enjoys very little respect. But just as brave Germans have turned their backs on Nazism, brave Danes have turned their backs on the policy of collaboration. - We must give these Danes a voice. - Hear, hear! Wherever we can let our voices be heard, we must point to independent Denmark, to resistance. To the Danish soldiers and officers who have joined the ranks of the Allies. You do all realize of course that he has sold a huge chunk of ice for a bank vault full of gold. I can walk. I can walk. It really is no surprise that his name means merchant in German. Denmark, the government, well... The government has lost every shed of dignity. It's our task to restore Denmark's honor. How dare you. What is it that you like about Zilla? What is it you like about Zilla? Everything. Tell me what you like best. I like everything about her. I like her eyes. I like her hair. I like her laughter. Most of all, I like her sense of humor. Do you love her more than you love me? Charlotte, there's a war going on, people are dying now pull yourself together. And don't ever embarrass me in front of people again, ever. Do you understand? Will you stop it? Charlotte. Let's go out. Yeah. Well? - May I... - By all means. Sit down. I just got off the phone with Hoegh-Guldberg, who spoke personally with the King three days ago. - King Christian. - The 10th. And the King said, and I quote: "I cannot criticize the line taken by Ambassador Kauffman." - He said that? - Yes. Asked for his view of your unilateralism, he said: "I cannot criticize the line taken by Ambassador Kauffman." At this moment, it is announced that Montgomery has declared... that the German troops in Holland, Northwest Germany and Denmark have surrendered. Denmark is free after five years. Five years of stubborn resistance and heroic acts of sabotage. MAY 1945 Long live Kauffman! Hooray, hooray, hooray! King Christian arrives for the reopening of Danish Parliament. The Prime Minister is slightly delayed. Aren't you glad people are alive to applaud you? Aren't you glad someone fought back so that Denmark could be free once more? You've given Greenland away. You've abused the King's power and used state funds. You've pursued your own foreign policy. Were it up to me, you'd go to prison. Now, now, Svenningsen. There's no need to get all worked up. Welcome home, Kauffman. I know we owe you thanks, but you almost crossed the bloody line. - If you'll pardon my French. - No offense taken. Has Svenningsen told you about the countries we're considering for you? We were thinking Asia. You are aware that Roosevelt and I were quite close, aren't you? May he rest in peace. He always said he preferred good collaborators who were willing to go a long way for peace. President Truman agrees. He won't understand why I don't return to finish the job of having Denmark join the United Nations. - Yes. - Very well, then. When Parliament convenes tomorrow, you'll ratify my Greenland agreement. You've left us no choice... Then you will appoint me minister without portfolio and send me to the San Francisco Conference so that Denmark can officially join the United Nations. But we have a foreign minister for that. With all due respect, Prime Minister Buhl, I have the ticket, not you or our foreign minister. - You're staying in Washington. - Thank you. - I object! - One last thing. All the ambassadors who supported my independent line are to be restored and their stances to be recognized officially. We'll look into it. JUNE 26 1945 So to this city came 1300 representatives of 46 united nations. ...of the approval of the charter of the United Nations. Delegates... delegates from nations large and small. And from many countries devastated by war. This is an extremely historic occasion. The great task lies before us. The conference of the United Nations on international organization is now convened. The time for action is here, now. In your hands rests our future... If we do not want to die together in war, we must learn to live together in peace. Hello there... Nothing's changed. All the traitors still running the country. Smooth and gentle. Well, I remember you telling me that you were lucky if you met a single honest person in politics. I entered as an honest man. Yes, and you gave him the opportunity to fight an honest fight. I'm sure he's very grateful. Yes. Hopefully they'll be more like him in the UN. I will tell you something. - Which is? - There won't be another like you, not in the UN, not anywhere. Here's to the inimitable Henrick Kauffmann. And here's to the beautiful Mrs. Kauffmann, without whom Denmark wouldn't be a free country today. Damn right. Did I remember to tell you that I love you? Not nearly enough. What a shame. Let's stay home tonight. Absolutely not. Tonight we celebrate. Whatever you say, milady.
