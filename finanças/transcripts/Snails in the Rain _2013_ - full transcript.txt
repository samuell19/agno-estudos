A film by Yariv Mozer Tel Aviv, Summer 1989 It's noon, the plants... SNAILS IN THE RAIN To: Boaz Refaeli, 1551 Tel Aviv I want to return to the metaphor of de Saussure from our opening lesson. Remember the chess metaphor? In chess, a person joining a game's audience mid-way through requires no more information than the present layout of pieces on the board. And Language is the same. We could study how the rules of language change through time, or study the actual rules. You are late. -Class ended late. What can I do? "Class ended late." Tell your professors you need to get on time to work. What's this? Dear Boaz, Don't ask who I am or how I know you. I think about you a lot. I feel quite embarrassed sitting here, surrounded by my plants, writing to you, but I'm scared to go farther... You wrote it? -Yes. Me, "I think about you a lot". Grab it, grab the wardrobe. On its side... Don't push. Rain? -"Last Rains". Move it. Rain is the last thing I need right now. Any news from Jerusalem? Not yet. Why are you so sweaty? -It rained earlier. -Rained? -Yeah. "Last rains". I was sure you'll get an answer today about the scholarship. Don't touch that! What? Stop it. Not now.. Hello? -Oh, hi Noa. How are you? -Hi Ruth. We're fine here, thanks. Yourself? I wanted to speak with Boaz about the scholarship. Boaz? -Is he home? No, he's not back from University yet. How are you? -I'm fine, a little cold... Is he with the kids now? With the kids? -At karate? Oh, at judo? -Judo, karate, whatever... -I'll tell him to call you. -Okay. You have some nerve. I want to be there when Mrs. Ruth Refaeli hears ...that her son is working as a mover. She'd fall down dead right on the spot if she did. She asked about these muscular arms. What did you tell her? I said you teach Judo to kids. Go, take a shower. I want you all to look at Arik. When he was just a beginner, he was... But what a remarkable improvement! If you put an effort you will achieve. Thank you Arik, you can go back. If I wasn't sweaty I would kiss you. Again, from the top. On the spot, pay attention and... Smile! Six, seven, eight. Look at each other! You're beautiful! You're proud! Turn around! Stop laughing at me. I'm sorry. I can't help myself. I'm gonna get rid of these disgusting shoes Nir, switch places with Yoni! Boaz! You're dragging! -Boaz. Boaz! -What? Don't give up, Boaz! We're almost there. Smile! Smile! Don't give up, Smile! -Shut up! Go on! You're under fire! Go Boaz! Give it all you got! I know you are watching... Ouch, you're scratching me! I love you... Hello, Boaz. It's now the afternoon and I am here at my desk... I'm about to water my plants. I am growing geraniums ...along with spiderworts and a giant plant called a "yucca". A tempestuous name with an Indian tone, don't you think? Yucca. I generally stay at home. Sometimes, I muster up the courage to do bolder things. But I will not burden you with such embarrassing tales. Inside the walls of this house I stay with my most loyal friend ...loneliness. It and I, hold hands in the night, watching television. Time is our greatest enemy. It has no mercy, Boaz. You'll understand that one day. and maybe you will not. Soon, you will walk out of the post office. Get in your '81 Subaru car and drive to the university. Between classes you'll have coffee and apple cake... And you'll smile at all the girls. Afterwards, you'll return home to your girlfriend... ...who loves you. But, Boaz, who will love me? You'll hug her at night. But who will hug me? I've said too much already. I can no longer hide my secret. I think about you incessantly. Here at Tel el-Amarna on the bank of the Nile River, in winter of 1887, a cache of cuneiform tablets were found, written in Akkadian. The lingua franca commonly used during the time of Egyptian empire was Akkadian. Like the English of today. How can we benefit from the letters sent from Canaan? What can we benefit for studying the spoken Hebrew language of today? Who will reveal the secret of the Amarna Letters? Professor Richlin! -Boaz. Any word on the scholarship? Nothing. That's why I thought that maybe you could help. I'm just a recommender. It takes time. Be patient. We haven't found an apartment and I want to know if we should look near the university. Be patient. It takes time. Coffee? -Yes, please. Black, one sugar. Thank you, Professor Richlin. You remember we heard this song? In the window there was a dream... Did you register for the Technion in Haifa? What are you talking about? We're moving to Jerusalem. Why you can't study architecture in Jerusalem? She should become a chef! She should become a baker! How long have you been with Boaz? Next week it'll be one year and three months. You? Can I get you more coffee? -Four and a half years ..two days ago. Didn't you tell me that you signed up for the Technion? I did. He just doesn't know. Is everything okay? I had to read something for my exam tomorrow. Since when do you get anxious about exams? Hug me. Hello, Boaz. This car is really falling apart. You said that the last time. Boaz... I need to tell you something. I deliberately sabotage your car, because I like seeing you here. Man, you are too serious. Loosen up. What's the stress about? University is messing up your head. Hezzi! Start working on Boaz's car. Come back in two days to pick it up, ok? How's the cake? It's a cake... When will Boaz be back? He's still in the University. If he had known you were coming... There's no need to let you know. Why waste the phone call. Okay, I believe I've waited long enough. I'm sorry. -Don't be, It's not your fault. Tell me something Noa, are you two planning on getting married? Umm, I don't really know... I can only answer on my behalf.. Don't you talk about it? Maybe it's too early...? -Nonsense. Tell him to call me, would you? You should water the geraniums. I'll tell Boaz, he's the one watering them. And what do you do? Oh.. you cook... Well... I don't smoke. Try. I am late for class. -Me too, so what? I prefer not to. You requested "An Introduction to Semitic Syntax"? Yes. Thank you. You're welcome, Boaz. You know my name? Your Student card is right there. Ori! Stop it! Boaz! Enough! Calm down, handsome. There's Prof. Richlin, from the university. Mom! Don't look so shocked. Did you say you were coming? -Why do I have to say it? I just get on a bus and I'm here. Where are you going? To the university and stuff. I brought you the cake you like, and some honey. We visited Yossi and Nitza, They insisted we go to Tel Aviv. I don't see why people are so crazy about this town. And... Mom, I really need to go. -Go on, I'm not stopping you. And we visited Nir David too. -Did you forget something? Ruth, You brought a cake? -It's the kind Boaz likes. I just came by to drop some stuff and I'm gone. What is that smell? Oh, you're cooking again... Boaz... Are you following me? The noises in your car, it was the carburetor. Come by tomorrow morning to pick it up. Boaz? Boaz? Did you want anything? Did you get a notice of rejection for the scholarship? No. The letter hasn't arrived yet. Oh, it's just that you are so quiet. Boaz, is there anything else bothering you? No. Not at all. Damn! I hate when that happens. Big Deal. They say it brings good luck, don't they? I wouldn't know, I don't believe in these stuff.. What's to believe? It's just the way things are. Boaz, do you want to have a bath together? Why does it take so long for a letter to arrive from Jerusalem? I hate starting my day at the post office. Do you want me to go tomorrow instead of you? Nah, it's on my way to university anyhow. So stop thinking about it. Easy for you to say. You know we have to find an apartment there, and move... This guy was looking at me in the library today. A young guy. He was wearing this silk shirt. And why do you think he was looking at you? I'm sure he was looking at me. He had that kind of a look. Did you want to look back? Boaz, did you want to look back? What does he have to do with me? Are you okay? Are you okay? -I'm okay. I'm sorry. -It's okay, It's fine. Come on, Nir! Let's go Nir! -Go Yoni! Come on, Nir! -Go Yoni! Your brown eyes, girl. Remind me of my dreams... ...of beautiful quiet days, ...of smiles and tender looks ...that I can not forget. And with a brief glance... ...that made me think of a gloomy day... ...Don't take my feelings lightly... I also changed some other parts just to be safe. Geraniums. Yeah. When it's hot... you have to water them even more... but only in the evening. Didn't you learn that in the Kibbutz? It's very important to water then after dark. Boaz, my dear. I can call you "my dear", right? I feel like we have known each other for a long time now. A week ago, I had the most awkward encounter. I want to tell you about it. Perhaps then you will understand me better. I was driving to work with a friend on Ibn Gabirol Street. A beautiful soldier was standing on the median, waiting for the light to change. He had black hair and grey eyes. My friend, suddenly says: "Check out the body on that girl." I said: "Where, what are you talking about?" It turns out that next the soldier, was another one, a girl. Do you understand, Boaz, my dear? I didn't even see her! She didn't exist for me! I lowered my head in shame. How despicable this existence is, Boaz, my dear! How unfair! And yesterday was my birthday. I invited some friends over for coffee and cake but I didn't tell them for what occasion. I sat in the living room, next to the large plant. I tried to get caught up in the soft, depressing, but gentle bustle. I thought to myself: how nice would it be if you would come over. I don't know but that image. To see you sitting in my white arm chair, your wise, tender eyes staring into mine. That image excites me. Boaz! Dinner's ready! Sometimes it is with great effort that I restrain myself from touching your beautiful face, your hair, your arms... I think about your girlfriend, who most certainly enjoys your arms; all I feel is pain swelling in my throat. This afternoon, I decided to take a walk, to cool off, to organize my thoughts. And suddenly I saw you sitting on the bus. Line #25, I believe. You were looking onto the street, entirely carefree. I fear saying this outright but... I know that I love you very much. You don't like it? No. What are you talking about? I like it. Are you okay? -What! Boaz, Why are you annoyed at me? Am I your mother? I can't believe this is happening to me! Ori left me! He just got up and left! He's going to Thailand. Alone. He showed up with a back pack and a bandana on his head. And milk... ...and soup almonds. Leaving just like that... no warning signs. How long have they been together? How should I know? How long have WE been together? Since I first saw you at Dr. Cooperschmidt's office. Anything else? You know what, I'll do the shopping. I feel bad for her, but at the same time, it's her fault. What's her fault? -She should have known. He got up one morning, bought a flight ticket, and left. I don't mean to disturb you, but have you finished with the book? Sorry. I'm still using it. I was referring to Plato's "The Symposium". Oh. It isn't mine. For some reason I thought you were in the Classics Department. Semitic Languages. -Yes, of course. Anyway, I recommend reading "The Sympoium". Thanks, I have already. "Wisdom is one of the most beautiful things, Eros loves beautiful things, and therefore Eros is necessarily a lover of wisdom." I took an extra credit course in philosophy. I refute the claim that both languages are from the same Canaanite source. That's my thesis and I support it by comparing the two and their history. Those who read my article can see the references, and through them, how I bring the proof. By the way, I also quote my colleague Professor Izrael, from his own article which also refers to this subject, and you can see that he supports the same thesis as well. I ask you to read the article for the next lesson. Professor Richlin, Professor Richlin! About the scholarship... Professor Richlin. Exams for architecture school in Haifa. It hurt. Don't do that ever again. You hear me? Boaz? -I'm sorry. Girls' barracks - Do not enter Boaz! Yes Commander. -What are you doing here? On my way to the post, Commander. Give me 20! Boaz, you're in my sights. Go on! Scram! Stay with me a little. You're late! Want a candy bar? No, thanks. I don't eat this late. She's cute, isn't she? Yeah. It's cool, I also like taking a little peek. Boaz, my dear. You know you're a beautiful man. What? You've never been told you're beautiful? Yeah, I have, I guess... Yours eyes... they're like a girl's. Nir, what are you talking about? Nothing. We're in the same unit, can't I tell you what's on my mind? Yes, of course you can. Come closer for a second. -Why? Come on. What are you scared of? What? What did I do? Why are you angry? Forget it. I'm just tired. Have a good night. Let's begin. I want my parcel now. I need the second notice. How do I know which one it is? Hold him please, for just a second. I can't remember which... It's been more than two weeks. I want to speak with the manager. -Itzik! Ma'am, calm down please. -I need my parcel now. Yardena? -It's been two weeks. The Tuchman International Foundation for Linguistics I was here first. -Ya. My dear beautiful Boaz, how wonderful to call you mine. How marvelous is the ease with which a typewriter can juxtapose those words. But where are you? I'm presently at my desk. The door is locked. In front of me on the table is a box of cake that I purchased on my way home. I shall cut one slice for me and another for you. I know that I'm losing my mind. Last night, I could no longer bear the pain. I took a pair of sunglasses and went to that place... You can guess to where. Many lonely and hungry men fluttered about like blinded butterflies in the trees. I always promised myself that, even in my darkest hour, I would never venture there. I gave into my lust and followed them to the garden of dead trees, sunglasses shielding my eyes, despite the darkness. A young boy simply dressed started following me like a dog in heat. He stopped by the bushes and signaled for me to get down on my knees. He pulled down his pants and grabbed the nape of my neck. I simply closed my eyes and thought of you, Boaz, your naked body moving in and out my mouth, When he reached orgasm, pulling at my hair, he wickedly asked me to give him money. Give me some money for the cab! I then lay down on the earth and vomited. I was overcome with disgust. When I returned home, I prepared a bath and could not stop crying. I understood that I could not go on like this... that I cannot torture myself not knowing if you read my letters or not. If you think about me, if you care for me to continue. Listen well, Boaz dear, This letter will be waiting for you on Thursday. At precisely 10 pm on Thursday I will be hiding... ...at a point from which I can observe your windows. Your coffee is getting cold. If you want me to continue writing, you will turn the kitchen lights on and off three times. Do not forget, three times, at 10 pm on the dot. I will be the happiest man alive. I will be renewed. But if you do not, I will never bother you again, dear Boaz. In that case, this letter will be my last. You understand that you won't receive any mail to this box any more? I understand. There's someone waiting for your in your office. For me? -Yes. How may I help you? My name is Noa. Noa what? Boaz's girlfriend. I found these in his drawer. I know you sent them. I don't have a clue what you are talking about. I sat with him on the bus, line #25, a few days ago. Boaz said to me: "There's Professor Richlin! My professor!" I saw the way you looked at him. It was the look of a man in love. But I kept my silence until your last letter. Sit down, Noa. You asked him to turn on the kitchen lights three times tonight. Leave Boaz alone. I don't know what he's going through. I didn't even apply to architecture school. I got the reply from Jerusalem. Congratulations! Are you happy? We should go out tonight. I'd rather stay at home. Are you sure? That was good, huh? Excellent. It was very good. -Good. I'll make coffee. Finally. You got an answer. Yeah. THE END Are there any leftovers? -Should I warm you up a plate? I'll do it myself. Is everything okay? Look on the bottom shelf in the fridge... Where are you going? I need some air. I feel suffocated here. Do you want me to come? No! I'm suffocating! Don't you get it? Are you insane? Crazy fuck! I'm putting some of your cologne. The money. Call me. What's wrong? Richlin resigned from the University. Nobody knows why, but they say he sounded unwell. So, can we go? What's this? In memory of Amos Guttman (1954-1993)
