Hey. We're here. Hurry up, you guys. Here it is. The red-stair house. Are the two of you... coming in with us? I don't think so. Look at the atmosphere. Super spooky. What are you scared of? I've been to this house before. There's nothing. -What about you? -I'm not going in. You're going in, Oil? -I better not go in. -Chicken. I'm recording this as evidence. -What the fuck are you recording, Biew? -You two. You're not going in? Then I'll go. -Nick, wait for me. -Hurry up then. You'll see. Come on. -Hey. Wait for me. -Hurry up. -Is this for real? -Yeah. This is for real. -It's so desolate here. -You're right. Damn. How can it be this creepy? -Wait, Nick! -What? -Tell me if you see something. -Sure. I'll let you know. Can you just keep it down? It's so fucking eerie in here. Here it is. The red-stairs. They really are red. Curious about its history? This place's history... Ready? -You really want to hear it? -No. The owners of the house fought over something, and fell down! Brains everywhere. Brains everywhere? Super terrifying. Shit! You scared me. -Get that flashlight out of your face. -Come on. Hurry. I said don't be afraid. If I see a ghost, I'll beat it up. -What a bruiser. -That's not all. That's not all? Every year, people would come and hang themselves here. You better be careful if you're slow. What the hell is wrong with you? Shit! -Should we go in? -I say we go back. Hey. They're your friends. Let's go take a look. The second floor is creepier than the first floor. Shit. -Stop! -It's here! -It's a ghost? -Ghost my ass. I think it's in this room that people hanged themselves. Follow me, and watch your steps. Slip and your brains would splash. Let's go. Let's go back. It's probably nothing. -It's all in your head. -It's not in my damn head! I know you heard it too, or else you wouldn't turn around. Come on. Follow me. Turn on the flashlight. Which way? -I think it's this way. -I heard it from this way. Hurry up, James. What a slowpoke. -Nick. -What? -Where are you taking me? -In this room... someone hanged herself here. Super scary. Stop whining, James. -That's Biew, not me. -It's you. James, why are you shaking? I'm just cold. -That's the owner's bed? -How should I know? -Biew. -What the fuck do you want? You. Why not James? -You do it. -You do it. Shit. Just do it already. Why are you shaking? Sacred monk charm, please help me... Jesus! Jesus what? I'm doing it. I think I've found it. -Found what? -Ghost. Ghost? Yes. Why are you telling me this? Well, you said I should tell you if I saw something. You don't need to tell me anything! Where is it? Up there. -James. -What? You look. -Why don't you look yourself? -I'm busy... poking this. You look. I'm also busy. I'm praying. Why are you messing around right now? Look at the same time. One... Two... Three. It's only me. -What did you find? -A ghost! -That way! -This way!

The semester's done. What do you want? -About what? -The thing we talked about. Why did you stop? You forgot? Or are you chicken? What do you mean, chicken? Let's go. I thought you were chicken. That night you ran the fastest. I was regrouping, so I can go back and help in time. You guys just don't get me. -Benz, I have something to show you. -Where? -That other night. -What? I was there. I brought these two... -but they waited outside. -What? I even have evidence for you. Here. -Pale as a ghost. -Hello, teacher. Weren't you scared? Me? I'm never scared. Not scared my ass!

I'll call. -But she speaks English. James. You call. Shit. Just give me the dirty work. Let's go. -I'm not going. -Let's go. -No. -Hurry up. Do you know why we're not allowed to enter this building? -Because the doors are locked? -Locked my ass. It's becasue someone died. -It was a 12th grader. -A girl? Our school's boys only, stupid. Couldn't make admission. Stressed out. -So he went up to that corner on the roof. -Must be the second floor. I said roof! He jumped. Hit his head. Bashed one side of his skull in. -Is he disabled? -He's dead! -Dead? -Yes. -He's dead? -Yes. I'm going to take you all in to see. Hey! Any ghost who thinks he's powerful... like, an uber-scary one, I... and my friends... and friends of my friends... will go in to let you haunt us. Lord Buddha, please protect me. -Lord Buddha, please protect me... -What's with you, Brian? This is uber-scary.

I'm praying. That's not a prayer. That's the five precepts. What about you guys? Not joining him? -Nick! -What's up? Remember the spirit house you trashed? You want me to trash this one? The spirits in that one followed us. Where? Where did they go? Where? -Between those two buildings. -There's nothing there. Yes, there is. -Are you really going in, Nick? -Why else would I be here? Ghosts! Get ready to haunt! Nick! What? -Nick. -Hurry up. This place may have some sort of energy. Stop setting the mood. We're scared enough as it is. Biew. Say this, "Come out! I want to see you!"

Who pulled me? -What the heck is up with you? -What is that? -It's nothing. You guys are so scared that you're seeing things.

How can I let James up stage me? But I saw him go really pale. Screamed like a little girl. What about that ghost? Oh yeah. Hey, James. Where'd you get the mushy-headed-ghost? He looked so real! Did you see it? The brain was oozing, and oozing... down this side... -So real. -But I didn't hire him. It had to be Nick. -It's a double trick. -I didn't hire him. I didn't hire him! James... Nick.... and I... didn't hire anyone. Then who? James! Is this a prank or is it for real? It's for real! It's an abandoned building! Who would take a shit here at this time? Biew, go take a look. -Me again? -Yes. -I'm too scared. -Hurry. Here I go. -I'm actually going now. -Just hurry up. There's nothing in here. You're right... There's nothing. Shit.

You're challenging me? -But there's a ghost downstairs, Miss. -That's right. What ghost? -Then I'll go-- -Nick! There's a ghost downstairs. Miss, may we please stay with you tonight? -Please, Miss. -Please. If you want to stay here, follow me. Quick. -I said follow me! -Let's go, Brian. -James.

Why don't you go to sleep? I'm not sleepy. -How about you? -How do you expect me to sleep... with this damn ghost staring at my face, waiting for a chance to haunt me? Nick. -What? -Where are Oil and those guys? They've disappeared. You're right. I think they've probably gone home. There's a pillow. Hey, you guys should get some sleep. The teacher should let us out tomorrow. If your friend has these symptoms again, you can't just play around. Find a spoon or something hard for him to bite on. Or else he might bite off his tongue. -Yes, Miss. -Yes. Apart from you, are there others? Miss Wanpen. Come this way, please. I need to discuss something Okay. Just a minute. You three remember, don't go anywhere. If the two of us aren't back, you must stay in this room. Understood? Yes, Miss. Let's go. Hey, Tape. What's today? What is it, Oil? Can you find a calendar for me? Benz, go look. Is something wrong? Are you okay? -Any better? -Here's a calendar. Is something wrong? The 10th... with new moon... Hey, you two, remember the story I told you at the dorm that night? See the building next door? -Paraminwittayakom building. -Nick. Don't tell me... you're telling a... a... -a ghost story! -Of course, I am. Don't be afraid, little one. Daddy's here. James, if you're scared, you best carry your little one outside. Fine. I will. You're not stopping me? Then I'm not going. -This building-- -Nick. You're really telling it? This late at night? -It's so scary at this time. -Tape, you shit head. What the hell are you scared of? Have you seen the ghost hunt in the show "Ghost Display"? All of the homes that are haunted, the three of us have treaded. Are you going to listen? This building was built in 1957. It's 50 years old. But the building you're seeing today is a new building, built on top of the old one. And do you know why it's haunted? A senior student, grade 12... was very good in school... but couldn't make admission. Thus, he decided to kill himself. But that's not what I've heard at all. They say... before they demolished the old building... some teachers killed each other in that building. And whenever it's an 8th night of the waning moon... or a new moon someone would see that teacher walking around the building. People around there got so frightened. Spooky, right? Then, this next school break, I'll take you all for an adventure. Let's see whose story... is the true story. That means your story is true. Yeah. Tape, I say we leave. But the teacher said to wait here. Wait for what? Then let's go tell Nick and the gang. Let's go. Biew. Brian. Where the hell are you guys? I'm here. Who gave you permission to enter? Leave this place this instant! And never return again! Take your friends with you! -Go! -Okay. Hey, everybody! Why won't you leave us alone? Let me hit him. I'll hit him. Wait! Stop! I need to take this. -Hello, Nick. -What kind of ghost has a phone? This isn't Nick. -He's a northerner. -May I speak with Nick, please? Who's Nick? I am. It's for you. -Hello? -Hello, Nick. Where are you? Why aren't you home by now? Jenny? Hello? Jenny. Hello? It's dead. Hey, ghost. -How did you get my phone? -I'm a ghost. I can take your things when ever I want. Want a flashlight? I even have a lighter. Quit babbling. Guys, -beat him up! -Wait. I'll go get your mom to come play with. -Why are you so scared? -Son of a bitch! Told you so. There's no such thing as ghosts. It's all in your head. See? Told you so. Ghosts don't exist. Chickens. Give me that flashlight. Let me see that face. I knew you're not a real ghost. I was just pretending. -James. -Son of a bitch! Made me run all that distance. -James. -Huh? -Guard him. -Me? Yes. You made me run upstairs and now I have to guard you. Stop following me. I'm going to take a piss. Hold this. Nick! The book opened by itself! What kind of book opens by itself? The wind blew it. I saw it too, though. It really did open by itself. You're as crazy as he is. The wind? What wind? I didn't feel any wind. -I really did see it, James. -Where? Buzz off. Did you see it, Biew? Ghosts don't exist. If I see one, I'll piss on it. And if I don't see any, I'll curse them all to eternal limbo. If it's a child ghost, I'll punt kick it. If it's a male ghost, I'll piss on his damn face. And for the female one, I'll rape her. But give me a pretty one. Nick! Is this her? Nick! Is this her? Miss Pannee Rattanawiset. Birth: August 2nd, Death: July 13th, -She's definitely dead. -Yeah, she's dead. Hold this. "The fighting of teachers at Poramin School lead to the death of teachers in the classroom M. 6/5." Does anyone know what room this is? When we came in, I saw that it was room M. 6/4. CLASSROOM M. 6/4 What a relief. -James. -What? Point the light to the photo again. Me? Who was that? We don't want the teacher to hear. Hey. Someone's coming. How can she be here? Let's get out of here. Do you think it's her? I think it has to be her. What do we do? What do we do? I'm scared. There's a buddha image at the front. Someone go get it. Who? Fine. I'll do it. James, light the way for me. And you guys find somewhere to hide. Don't make a sound. -Hurry. -Keep the light steady. Come on. Hurry up. Nick, hurry up. -Just climb, or it'll be too late. -I know. -Nick! -Are you okay? M. 6/5 M. 6/5... She's back. Who wants to see me? -Come here! -Brian! Let me go. Miss... Stop it, Pannee. How much more bad karma do you want. Leave me be. Brian! Was it you? No, Miss. -Then it was you! -No, Miss. No, Miss... Teacher, I'm sorry. Nick, where's the Buddha image? Who cares?

I say we should take a look inside. -Maybe he's inside. -Nick, wait for me! Give me the flashlight! Poraminwittaya School. That's our school. Nick, can you remember the story I told you? Some teachers killed each other in this building. We already met the teachers. They are-- What are they? They are teachers, Miss. You know where this is, don't you? I'll help you find a way out. I will not let you leave! How dare you challenge me? Pannee. -Please, stop. -I will not! These kids... need a teacher like me! Benz! Benz! Stand back, kids. Go! Biew, hurry up! -I'm gone! -Biew! Biew! Come on! Excuse me, sir. -James. -James. Help me. Which way should we go? This way or that way? That way! Biew! James, how did you get here? I don't know either! Look! My pants are all ripped. Help me think, Chip the Ghost. That's not my name. It's Mark. I don't care if you're Mark or Moron! Just help me think! -What do you want from me? -Just hurry up. They're coming. Shit. What do we do? You kids have never feared or respected teachers, have you? -Not true. We're scared to death of you. -Liars. You insulted me. That's why you dared to come here. -We didn't insult you, Miss-- -Hush! Don't argue! -I'm not arguing. -This is called arguing. Don't you even think that I'll let you out of here so easily. Teacher. Please don't hurt us. I said don't argue! Pannee. Get out of here, kids. That's enough, Pannee. These kids are like your students. These rascals are not my students! They don't respect you... because you're like this! That's right, Pannee. You have a bad temper. That's why no one loves you. Including you, Mr. Saman? Yes. You can both die together then! Hey. The ghosts are getting closer. Where are they? Hurry up! Hurry up! Still needs blood. The blood has dried out. I didn't bring any extra. Is that your toe? It's really bloody. I can't reach! You suck on it. Suck it! Hurry up. Still not enough. Suck again.

I need to talk to Miss Wanpen. Hurry up! What's up with her? How did Miss Wanpen get here? She was just helping us. You're right. Quiet. What is it, Pannee? Are you having an affair with Mr. Saman? No. Pannee! It's not Wanpen's fault. It's all on me. That means you both admit that you're having an affair. No one loves you... because you're like this. Including you, Mr. Saman? Yes. You love each other so much, don't you? You can both die together then. Pannee! -Pannee. -Let go of me! Mr. Saman! Pannee! Is this worth killing each other for? So all the teachers are actually ghosts? Miss Pannee! Guys, follow me. I know the way out. That way! Hurry! Quick, follow me. Is he okay? -James... -Your mouth... Miss Pannee slapped me, silly. Never mind that. Follow me. You rascals! You think you can escape me? Guys! There's the exit! Where? Let's go! Please, don't hurt us. Stop following us! Is it you who disrespects your teachers? No, Miss. -Please don't hurt my friend. Hurt me. -Biew! Stay out of this! Teacher... Hurt me instead. Kids who disrespect their teachers, like you... deserve to die! That's enough. These kids have nothing to do with your problem. -Why don't you ever listen to us? -Why should I listen to you? Wasn't it you who made me this way? No matter what... I will take these kids with me. Don't you know... that all that happened to you didn't happen the way you thought. You misunderstood it this whole time. Think hard about the events on that day. Are you okay, Miss Pannee? -We're almost at your room. -Hurry. We're here. Wait here. Thanks, kids. Miss Pannee should be okay. -Yes, sir. -Let's go. Let's go, Mr. Sombat. Mr. Sombat is dead. Mr. Saman. Remember the day we carried Miss Pannee to her room? Yes. After we left, I saw Mr. Sombat go back into that room. It all happened because of your wrath... even though you knew the truth... that Mr. Saman didn't get you pregnant. The one who did, was Mr. Sombat. Didn't you kill him already? All you want is revenge. You thought everyone hurt you... though they had nothing to do with this. Lies! It's not as you say. Pajera Jariya Honti. Kunu Tara Nusa Sakan. I pay my humble respect to all my teachers who gave me an education, who granted me knowledge, taught me ethics in this present day. Any ghost who thinks he's powerful... My friends and I are coming up! Ghosts don't exist. If it's a male ghost, I'll piss on his damn face. And for the female one, I'll rape her! Pannee. You're a good teacher. Since the students have made mistakes, we should teach them and guide them to the right path. Once the students accept their mistakes and are ready to apologize... we should forgive them. Because they call us their teachers. Isn't that right, Pannee? Pannee. Let them go. Please, Pannee. Let them all go. I'm so sorry, teacher. We're sorry, teacher. You can all go now. She's letting us go. I said go! Thank you, teacher. Mark, what are you standing there for? Hurry up or it might be too late. You guys go. I can't go with you guys anymore. Because I'm where I belong. You don't belong here. This is someone else's home. Hurry up, crazy! You kids should go. Mark was right. He's been here a long time. That's right. I've been here for so long. Can you remember? When you first came into the building Hurry up. I tried to chase you out of the building, but you wouldn't go. You weren't afraid of me. Until today... when you arrived here... I tried to help you, yet you couldn't leave. Guys, follow me. I know the way out. Do you remember? That means you're a-a-a... a ghost? Yes. Everyone... I need a favor. Go back to the classroom M. 6/5 and take all of our pictures out... and burn them. Yes, sir. Hurry up and go, kids, before dawn. Go that way. Thanks a lot, Mark. I'm off. Let's go. Goodbye, teachers. -Let's go. -Good luck. Let's go... We're here to fulfill our promise to you. May the three of you rest in peace. Any wrongs that we've done to you, please forgive us. I sort of miss Mark. What the hell, man? Why would you call him out? He's a ghost! Even as a ghost, he's more generous that you are, Biew. -He's probably been reborn by now. -Not yet. -Not yet my ass! -That wasn't me. -Why are nudging me? -Your friend's here. -What friend? -Look. Mark! Honestly, James... I uber-miss you so much. -You know that slang? -Yes. Why the hell did you uber-miss me for? Why the hell did you call me here for? I was just saying it. Let go! I'm gone. Biew. Don't be afraid, Brian. -Aren't you two afraid of me? -Yes. Keep hugging... and you might get laid tonight. Hurry the fuck up and go. Let's go, Brian. Subtitle Translation by Nantawan Riddell
