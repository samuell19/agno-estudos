[dramatic band music] [audience applauding] [exuberant piano music] [dramatic band music] [audience applauding] [audience applauding] - Aren't you glad you came? [laughing] [exuberant piano music] After all, I never get on the stage to preach. I do my thing and I do it sincerely and I want the audience to love me and the only way to do that is to let them know that I care about them and love them. [exuberant piano music] [audience applauding] - [Men] Hey! [exuberant piano music] - I'm gonna play that part again, so you can all shout "Hey!" Alright? Okay. [exuberant piano music] - [Audience] Hey! [exuberant piano music] - You wanna do it again, don't you? [audience laughing] Alright, okay. - [Audience] Hey! [exuberant piano music] - How 'bout the ladies doing it all by themselves? Let's hear that. - [Ladies] Hey! [exuberant piano music] - Okay, fellas, now it's your turn. - [Fellas] Hey! [exuberant piano music] - You see there are men in my audiences, too. [audience laughing] See that? How 'bout that? Very good. Marvelous. I hope I didn't leave anybody out. [audience laughing] [audience applauding] Oh, and I gotta tell ya, so many people here have asked me whether this is my piano and I'm rather proud to say it is. There are only two in the whole world like it. [audience applauding] Thank you very much. And I got both of them. [audience laughing] I always carry my own bench, uh huh. Oh, I waited a long time for this particular one, as you can imagine. It's covered in white virgin mink. Yeah, uh huh. And you know how rare that is. Now, this boogie woogie I've been playin' for ya is a kind that is known as boogie woogie eight to the bar. Here's a little invention of my own. Boogie woogie 16 the bar. [exuberant piano music] [audience applauding] [trumpets blaring] [audience applauding] As you know, I love clothes. These are some of my street clothes and the reason I love so many clothes is because I guess when I was a kid I had to wear my brother George's hand-me-downs. Now that I can afford to buy my own, I have 'em in about three sizes because I love to eat and my weight constantly fluctuates, so most of my suits come in three sizes, thin, fat and impossible, and I have 'em in a see-through wardrobe with sliding glass doors. [squeaking] I should say squeaky sliding glass door. I have here, in this home, about 200 suits, 400 sport shirts and slacks and about 100 pairs of shoes, and believe it or not, I wear them all. [audience laughing] I don't blame you for laughing. Sometimes, I look at all this stuff and I can hardly believe it myself. [audience laughing] Oh, well. My clothes may look funny, but they're making me the money. [audience laughing] Oh thank you very much. Oh wait, wait, I gotta tell ya. Remember that bank I used to cry all the way to? I bought it. [audience laughing] I love it, I tell you. I kinda like this place. [audience laughing] Uh huh. We'll see. Okay, this is for the newlyweds who, incidentally, ladies and gentlemen, are a most unusual couple. I understand it's the second time around for both of them. She's 65 and he's 71 and they requested a very beautiful song, "It's Impossible." [audience laughing] I'm about to have a costume fitting for an entrance cape that I'm going to wear at the Royal Command Performance in London and Frank Acuna, who's been my costumer for nearly 20 years, is going to make it for me. How are you Frank? - Fine. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Frank? - Yes. - I thought we would use this material on the outside-- - On the outside. - And this for the lining, this black satin and then-- - [Frank] Have it reversible. - Have it reversible, so that if I decide to wear this side out, I can. - Alright. - And then I can wear this side when I make my entrance, and then when I return for my final bow, I'll have it in reverse and then I'll wear this side. - Wonderful. - It should look good. - That will look good. - You said you were going to bring a muslin pattern. - I have a muslin pattern. - Have you? Could I try it on? - Yes, sir. - Most of my costumes are inspired by costumes that Frank Acuna made for famous stars of the past. It's gonna be like in Inverness. It's gonna have holes under here so I can put my arms through. - [Frank] Armholes, yeah. - Yeah. The cape that he's going to make me for the Royal Command show was made for Fredric March. What year was that, Frank? - [Frank] Geez, I don't remember exactly. - I think that has enough sparkle the way it is, but Frank, I think this could stand a few more jewels, don't you? - [Frank] That's right. - [Liberace] Yeah. - [Frank] Yeah, I see it. - It's a little dull. - I think it needs a little bit here. - Yeah, I think it could sparkle more. - More right here. - Yeah, we like jewels, don't we? - That's right. - Yeah, well that's what they pay to see right? - That's right. - So give 'em the jewels. - You need jewels, right. - Yeah, lots of jewels. - Only black jewels, eh? - Black jewels, yeah. - We need to put those-- - Yeah, anything else would be ostentatious. [mumbling] [dramatic band music] Thank you very much. How do you like my dogs? They're Afghans and the dark haired one is the girl and the light haired one is the boy, see? And of course, they're sorta like people, you know, with the long hair, you really can't tell the difference, and let me tell ya, they love people. They're very friendly. But let me tell ya, they're marvelous watchdogs, too. When you dress like I do, you need all the protection you can get, I'll tell ya. Come on, loves. Okay, back on your papers, there you go. Well, thank you for that lovely welcome. It's nice to be back. [audience applauding] You know, ladies and gentlemen, next week I've been invited to go to London to give a Royal Command performance for Queen Elizabeth. Isn't that exciting? [audience applauding] So, I wanted to give you a little preview of what I planned to wear, you know? I had this coat designed especially for the Royal Command Performance. Do you think she'll notice it? [audience laughing] What do you think? The fella who made it promised I'd be the only one there with one like it. You think he's right, huh? Yeah, you know what it's made out of? It's jeweled leather and ermine. You like it? It's a little different. Yeah, well good. Can I take the coat off now because it's hotter than hell. Okay? [sexy strip music] [audience applauding] You like the rest of it? Yeah. It's a little thing I had hanging in the back of the closet. [laughing] Actually, this is the first time I've ever had a costume that had a little bit of historical significance to it. All of this embroidery work is authentic. It's over 200 years old, and it's 23 karat gold. Yeah, I don't have it cleaned. I have it polished. [audience laughing] We're in my office at the Hollywood House and I'm sitting at my piano shaped desk dictating a few chapters of my autobiography to my sister, who is also my secretary. The autobiography is going to be called I Cried All The Way To The Bank. Chapter one. It's amazing how little people know about me as a man or as a person who's been around for some 50-odd years, 30 of them as a professional showman and musician. I'm I going to fast, Angie? Okay. Sure, they know I play the piano adorned with a candelabra, wear elaborate costumes, they cost $100,000 a year and are tax deductible. You can put that last sentence in parentheses. Well, what do they know about my humble beginnings? My father, parenthesis, I did have one, you know. My frequent brushes with death. I had the last rites as recently as 1963, my training as a serious musician, why I have 17 dining rooms, three homes, 13 cars, eight dogs, that I am a religious man and that I almost became the victim of an international kidnap plot in Cuba, why I have never married and once spent over three quarters of a million dollars on presents for my family and friends in less than two weeks. Further, there are some who think I'm the richest piano player in the world and live in a grand lifestyle that is usually reserved for royalty. This is the uh... This is the bar, the piano shaped bar off the pool area and on either side of the bar are cabanas and dressing rooms and the pool, we're actually looking at the back end of the house. It's very difficult to photograph the front of the house because it's on the very steep hill and it's only been photographed once, from the front, from a helicopter. But I didn't have one handy for you today, so, we're seeing it from the back, from the pool area. This home, which is in Hollywood, by the way, is only a couple of minutes from Sunset Boulevard, which is one of the main thoroughfares, and yet it has amazing privacy. Everyone who visits me are constantly amazed that we have outdoor carpeting everywhere. We have the thick kind of carpeting and the green kind of turf carpeting and this is the newest addition to the house. This room here was once an open veranda and I used to bring my guests out here to look at the wonderful view of Hollywood, and then I decided to enclose it as a porch and I got a little carried away because then I went from screens to windows and then I had the Italian tile floor put in and it turned out to be a room rather than a porch and, I decided this would be a good place to have a nice bar and we don't just use it as a bar, but we also use it for late-night entertainment for late after-theater suppers and that sort of thing. This is an iron fireplace and this used to be a plain wall here, and I opened up the fireplace that leads into the living room, so we have a two-way fireplace here, and these are Strauss crystals from Bavaria and my most prized possession are a pair of candelabras that came from Ludwig of Bavaria's castle. They are blue opaline glass and ormolu bronze and they're a museum piece. [exuberant piano music] And having some wonderful parties out here and after the sun goes down, it's inclined to get a bit chilly, so we have outdoor heaters to heat the atmosphere. They're hidden in the trees, so they're not noticeable, but I can actually warm this entire outdoor area to about 70 degrees which is very comfortable. Over here we have a barbecue, complete with candelabra and piano keys. And this is the barbecue area. This is my bedroom, how do you like it? It's French Victorian and most of the furnishings are antique. The cabinets are French Boulle, designed by Andre Boulle early in the 18th century. The bed is a combination of antique and carvings done by a Spanish artisan that I discovered right here in Los Angeles and I combined his carvings with the antique pieces that I found in an antique shop in my rummaging around and the bedspread is white llama fur and ermine. This is the master bath, with twin sinks. They call 'em his and hers, but since I'm a bachelor, I use 'em both myself. On the walls of the stairway are some of the cartoons and awards and presentations that commemorate my 30 years in show business. This was given to me by the county of Los Angeles to commemorate my silver anniversary in show business five years ago, and amongst other things they said I put the word glamour back into show business. I been cartooned all over the world by some marvelous cartoonists with great imaginations. This one up here in London, they likened me to Sir Ernest Macmillan there. And to our left, some awards to commemorate Columbia Record's the sale of over 100,000 albums each one of these represent 100,000 albums and kind of a marvelous award from the piano technicians who are, sort of, the unsung heroes of the piano world. The men who tune the pianos and keep them in top shape, deemed me the man who had done the most to promote interest in piano music during the year 1953. It's cartoons like this suggesting that I run for the United States' Senate that give people the idea that I may have political aspirations. I don't. I send Christmas greetings to the President of the United States every year and each year they send me an acknowledgment of the Christmas present. This one acknowledges my cookbook that I sent the President. He said, this was when Lyndon Johnson was President, he said we have your copy of Liberace Cooks. Mrs. Johnson joins me in thanking you for your thoughtfulness in sending us your book. [playful music] [shoes tapping] All my homes, like the one in Hollywood you've just seen, or my home and my guest house in Palm Springs are examples of structures that would have been torn down had I not bought them. Of course, the world is full of places like that. I come across them constantly, so I guess in a very small way I have been able to save what might otherwise have been destroyed. [playful music] [shoes tapping] Anyone can build a home if they had money, but to take something that is going to be torn down and is dying and make it live again by filling it with my collections is a very special kind of thrill for me. [audience applauding] [melancholy organ music] This organ was in a house when I discovered it and at first, I thought it was sort of Boris Karloff and I tried to give it away, you know, so, it was sort of dark and somber looking. Instead, I got it all fixed up and gold-leafed and glamorized and it's a theater organ, basically. It plays all kinds of things. Everything from birdcalls [birds tweeting] to uh, [booming] triangles and [chinging] and castinets. [clicking] Drums, snare drums. [snare drum rapping] Well, I've had a lot of fun with it. I'm not really good enough at the organ to play it in public but I entertain my friends and myself with it and it's quite fun. [playful piano music] That's my honky tonk piano which I use in some of my shows and it's kind of a fun piano because all the jeweling on it was done by my friends. We had a jewel party and I gave everyone a package of jewels and a tube of glue and I said, "Do your thing." And this is what happened. This is the smallest little piano in my collection, that's playable. I have smaller pianos in my collection, but this one actually was used on a recording session. It has a toy piano sound. It was made in Paris. [toy piano music] [somber organ music] This is a concert grand Bluthner piano which was built in Leipzig, Germany before World War Two. It's a very fine piano, but it also has an organ attachment which enables you to play the piano and the organ together or the organ by itself, or the piano by itself. It's sort of a one of a kind in my collection. This lever here is your volume control, also enables you to add the organ or not add it just by the touch of your knee. [dramatic organ music] [exuberant piano music] This is the easiest piano player for me to play because it's a player piano. In fact, I've started making piano rolls. I'm the first artist in 37 years to make rolls for the piano again on an ancient piano player roll recording machine that was invented in 1902. [exuberant piano music] [dramatic piano music] This is a very special antique piano. The cabinet, the case of the piano, dates back to the time of Chopin, but pianos, unlike Stradivarius violins, do not improve with age. They deteriorate with age. And so when I discovered this piano in Europe, I bought the piano for its case and then when I got it to America, I had an American piano action put in it. It's one of my favorite pianos. [melancholy piano music] I suppose I want to feel that my presence on Earth is going to be felt for a long time after I'm gone, so, in order to make this presence felt for posterity, I have done certain things. For example, I would like to feel that all the antiques I have collected will be enjoyed by people long after I become a memory. That's why I'm always going around antique shops when I have the time to see what I can find, also, I love buying things for people. I feel that all the beautiful things I live with have been placed in my care to look after. They don't really belong to me. They belong to the world. [melancholy piano music] Recently ladies and gentlemen I had the pleasure of doing a show with my good friend, Jack Benny, and I introduced a number on that show for the first time that I thought he announced in a very unique sort of way, so if I may borrow his words, he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, Liberace is now going to play "two well know piano compositions. "One is the Prelude in C sharp minor by Rachmaninoff, "the other is the love theme from the motion "picture The Godfather by Nino Rota "and he's going to play them both at the same time, "which proves he's not only a great musician, "but a big show-off." [audience laughing] [dramatic piano music] Nobody kids myself more than I do. I think the public appreciates the fact that I get a bigger charge out of my costumes, my candelabra, all this sort of showmanship than even the people in my audiences do. The only thing that hurts me is when the criticism goes below the belt, so to speak. I find that there is a sort of cancerous journalism that is out to destroy a person and this is very difficult to correct. Take the case of my London libel suit, for example. The largest libel settlement in the English courts that had ever been awarded an individual. A total stranger like Cassandra said something that was so distasteful that people who had never been aware of my presence at reading this could instantaneously hate me. ["The Godfather" by Nino Rota] It is amazing that so many people think that my name, Liberace is a stage name, yet, early in my career, when I told them what my name was, they said, well, you'll have to change your name because nobody can pronounce that. So, for about six months, I was known as Walter Buster Keys, which is a terrible name. But I suppose I really did have a mouthful for a name. My first name is Walter, my middle name is Valentino and my last name really is Liberace. ["The Godfather" by Nino Rota] I was born in West Allis, Wisconsin, which is a suburb of Milwaukee. The third child of an Italian father who came from a fishing village near Naples called Formia. My father was a professional french horn player and my mother, who is Polish-German, also came from a very musical family. We're having one of our rare family reunions. Rare because it's so seldom that we're all here at the same time. We're usually traveling on the road or away in our respective cities where we live, like my sister Angie lives in Davis, California and she dropped by for a visit. To my right is my mother. Mother just celebrated her 80th birthday and is very well and happy and especially happy because George dropped by unsuspectedly. - Thank you, Lee. It's a real wonderful surprise to see and help celebrate Mom's 80th birthday, too. This is real great and to be here at brother Lee after his long tour and my sister, Ang. - The only things that are missing now, the only persons that are missing is George's lovely wife, Dora and his little baby dog, Kittypoo and Angie's son and daughter and Angie is a grandmother. She has three grandchildren. You don't mind me telling that, do you? - Why, no. - When it's a surprise, make me happy. - [Liberace] Oh, thank you Mother. - Any surprise, I'm always very happy. - [George] Mom's a proud mother, she really is. It shows on her face. They got to all have that Liberace smile. [chuckling] - Right. - We love it when we get together. - I started studying when I was four and won a scholarship at the Wisconsin College of Music when I was seven and a half. That lasted for 17 years, which is the longest scholarship that had ever been awarded anyone in this college and during the scholarship term, I made my first professional soloist appearance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This is for Barbara and Buster's 25th wedding anniversary. - [Woman] I had a terrible feeling. - I'll let you open it. Then everybody has to sign it. - Oh, Lee. - 'Cause it's got all kinds of pages-- - [Woman] Isn't that, oh a record book for your silver anniversary. - [Liberace] And I did all that. - [Woman] Oh, he wrote, oh look. Oh the silver wedding anniversary record Barb and Buster. Congratulations and best wishes from Liberace. - [Liberace] And then this is for the people who - [Both] Stop by and express your best wishes. - [Liberace] And notes about your happy day. And this is photographs. I threw one of me in there. [laughing] On account of it's Seymour's birthday, we got Seymour. [laughing] Seymour's my manager. He's been with me for 26 years. - Thank you, in my office. - After a great deal of struggle, I finished up in the early 50s and some of the top supper clubs of America. Receiving a standing ovation at the Waldorf Astoria one night, going up to my dressing room, changing my clothes and walking out on the street afterward and becoming a complete non-entity. - Liberace, Liberace. - [Liberace] And I truly wasn't happy. I was not sure that I was doing the right thing, musically or entertainment wise until television came into my life. - [Man] Album here now. - And almost overnight, you know, I was being seen by 20 million, 30 million people, and I became known to so many people that it really made me think that at last I was doing the right thing. I think that possibly, one of the great accomplishments in my life is that I am one of the most recognizable persons, the most waved at persons. Let's put it this way, from taxi drivers, truck drivers to waitresses, waiters, as I walk through the lobby of a hotel, ladies who are polishing the floor look up, they recognize me, they know me and I love it. I think that being a concert pianist would have been very, very lonely. ["The Godfather" by Nino Rota] I would like to be remembered as a kind and gentle soul. I would like to think that my music would be remembered. And also some of the beautiful things that I've collected in my homes. In fact, I have formed a trust so that my personal belongings in my homes will be shared by the world after I'm gone as a sort of a museum. Above all, I think, I would like to remembered as someone who cared about people. [melancholy piano music] I realized very, very early in my career that the demands of being a concert pianist were very exhausting and I always liked to have had some kind of fun with my work. I didn't want it to be a force that made me do something I didn't really want to become. I was happy to play classical music, I loved it. But the people that I played the classical music for were just a handful of musical purist types and these were really not the people that I wanted to please. I really longed to please the man on the street and as one critic once said in a review of my San Francisco concert several years ago, he said, "Liberace is no Rubenstein, "but neither is Rubenstein a Liberace." [classical piano music] [audience applauding] [audience applauding] This home originally was a hotel, a small hotel. It had 32 guest rooms and it was crying out to be saved when I found it about four years ago. It had decayed quite noticeably and was going to be torn down, and I used to come over here in the evenings and look at the mountains and look at this beautiful structure. I felt that it was worth saving, so I bought it and I turned it into a private home. I find it very peaceful and serene and I like to just come out here and sit during the lovely evenings, which are very balmy, incidentally. The climate here in Palm Springs is very mild and at most times of the year, we have temperatures in the high 70s, the low 80s, even in the wintertime. The Chamber of Commerce insists that the average temperature is 82 degrees. The Cloisters is faced on one end by the master bedroom and on the other by the shrine to Saint Anthony. This is also a wonderful place to contemplate and find peacefulness. All the artifacts in this room come from churches that are now torn down. I found most of them at various auctions in Europe and around the country. The stained glass window, for example, is from Providence, Rhode Island and since I live across the street from the Catholic church, I am visited frequently by members of the church and the entire house has been blessed by the local bishop. This is the back and the sound you hear in the background is the whirlpool tub. It's a marvelous relaxing sort of therapeutic kind of bath. You can either use it without the whirlpool or with the whirlpool, which I really enjoy. This champagne bubble bath, if you want bubbles. Since the room is completely surrounded by mirrors you can see reflections wherever you look, reflections of the chandelier, the ferns. In fact, they go into infinity. The statue is from Rome and it's made of white carrara marble. This is the master bedroom at the Cloisters. Most of the furnishings in this room are French Empire and Louis XV. It has a vaulted ceiling and the most priceless possession in this room is the Louis XV desk which was presented to Czar Nicholas II of Russia and on which the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed. Most of the furnishings in this room were acquired through the purchase of a museum in Pensacola, Florida and the desk is truly priceless and it is insured for $275,000. As you can see, the dogs have the run of the house. Everybody says you have two beds in your bedroom. Well, one of them's for the dogs and the other is for me and this is the gazebo. It's at the far end of the property and it's a lovely place to have lunch under the grape arbor. When the grapes are in season, all you have to do is reach up and pick a bunch and they're very sweet seedless grapes. [water rushing] These are the director's chairs that I had made up last Christmas. Instead of putting name cards on all the gifts, I had names put on the chairs in front of the gifts for all my guests and friends and family and then when they took their gifts home, they took their chair with them. If I may be serious for a moment, ladies and gentlemen. You know, we're living in a fantastic world today, aren't we, with men on the moon and all that sort of thing. Sometimes, I find it a little hard to believe but I guess it's always been man's dream to seek a new world and this has been going on for centuries. I'm reminded of a very famous composer who, well over 100 years ago, wrote a composition in which he, too, was seeking a new world. In fact, he called this composition The New World Symphony. His name was Antonin Dvorak and recently, I came across some beautiful words that were sung by the very popular country folk singer Pete Seeger and I have taken these words and adapted them to the symphony of Dvorak and it's called "The Strangest Dream". [dramatic music] [dramatic piano music] Last night, I had the strangest dream, I never dreamed before. I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war. I dreamed I saw a mighty room. The room was full of men. And the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again. And when the paper was all signed, and plans for peace were made, they all joined hands and bowed their heads and silently they prayed. And the people in the streets below rejoiced and danced around. The swords and guns and uniforms were scattered on the ground. For now at last, they understood that wars are never won. They all joined hands in brotherhood. A new world had begun. [dramatic piano music] Last night I had the strangest dream, I'd never dreamed before. I dreamed we all lived in a world of peace. And war was never more. [dramatic music] [audience applauding] Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. I sincerely hope and pray, ladies and gentlemen, that that dream might come true for all us. Thank you very much. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. Today, I'm going to cook a very special lasagna recipe. I call it Liberace lasagna. Step number one. Remove all diamond rings. Not only makes the rings messy, but it might fall in the sauce. Now, since I don't like to chop onions, I use this very handy little chopper, keeps the tears out of your eyes. [smacking] [scraping] Lasagna is made from a long, flat noodle like this. I break it in two. We're in the main dining room of the Cloisters. I call this the William Randolph Hearst room because most of the furnishings in here very closely resemble those in San Simeon, which was the residence of William Randolph Hearst. One afternoon I was visited by William Randolph Hearst's son and he brought over some photographs of furnishings that he thought I might be interested in that would suit the architecture of this home and when he showed me the pictures, they were almost identical to the furnishings that you see in this room, so I thanked him and said I already had them. This is a marvelous cabinet. Everyone says how do you open it because there are no handles, you just push it in here. The glassware is from Czechoslovakia, but actually I bought it at Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida. I just checked the boiling lasagna and it's ready. Gram Care taught me a little trick. Instead of pouring cold water into the lasagna to keep it from sticking together, put in some ice cubes and then pour it in your colander. [water rushing] The candelabras are from a Spanish church and I have a pair of them, one on either side of the fireplace. This is perhaps one of the largest silver plateaus that I've ever seen anywhere in the world. This is a marvelous cabinet that I found in the east. It's from Italy and it serves a lovely purpose when we're dining and wanna watch T.V. - How much do you reckon to want, Mr. Howard? - Well, if convenient, I could use $100. - I guess we could all use $100. In this pan, I have browned two pounds of mild Italian sausage. If you like it stronger, of course, you can get the hot Italian sausage. Now to this I'm going to add the chopped onion, parsley, the veal and chopped pork and the chopped beef. You'll notice the paintings all have a sort of a religious significance because of the religious architecture of this house and the fact that it's called the Cloisters. Down below, we have some buffet serving pieces. I serve a lot of buffets as well as sit-down dinners. And of course, everywhere you look there are candelabras, naturally. You place the noodles in the pan, in a layer, like this and then you spoon the sauce. You've covered a layer of noodles with the sauce and now you sprinkle it with the mozzarella cheese and some of the dry farmer cheese, some of the macadamia nuts, the ricotta cheese, which has to be broken up in little pieces. I've always said that it's easier to learn how to cook when you watch somebody prepare a dish but on the other hand, I've always further said that if you can read, you can cook. When I serve a buffet, I have some French porcelain menu markers that look like this and then with a marking pen, I mark the various dishes that I'm serving. I think my piano's here someplace. Let's see. [playful piano music] Yeah, it's here. [dramatic piano music] That's fine. I always like to limber up a little bit before I go out on stage. I used to practice two or three hours in an empty auditorium but I found out I was giving my best performance to an empty house so now I just sorta limber up a little bit and save my energy for the performance. [dramatic piano music] I like to do most of my practicing at home when I'm off the road and then I practice sometimes for five or six or seven hours and, but once I start on the road, I have everything pretty down pat. Just takes a little limbering up. [dramatic piano music] That's good. Alrighty. [deep bass piano music] Of course, it hasn't always been as easy as this. Several years ago now, I was suddenly stricken with an acute kidney failure which lasted four or five days. After analysis, the doctors discovered that I had absorbed a poisonous amount of a deadly carbon tetrachloride, so I was sitting in my hospital room one day and these eight doctors all came in the room and said, "Do you wanna know the truth?" And I said yes, so they told me. They said the only thing we can suggest is that you make out your will and put your store in proper order. ♪ Down in the meadow ♪ In a itty bitty pool ♪ Swam three little fishes ♪ And the mama fishy too ♪ Swim said the mama fish ♪ Swim if you can ♪ And they swam and they swam ♪ Right over the dam ♪ Boop boop diddum daddum wantem choo ♪ ♪ Boop boop diddum daddum wantem choo ♪ ♪ Boop boop diddum daddum wantem choo ♪ ♪ They swam and they swam right over the dam ♪ [audience applauding] Oh, they don't write lyrics like that anymore. [laughing] Thank God. Now I'd like to play the same song for you the way I did many years ago at one of my first concerts. In the styles of some of the classical composers of the past. Here's the beautiful blue "Three Little Fishies" waltz by Johann Strauss. [uptempo classical music] So, after the doctors had told me I was going to die, I had the last rites and when that was all over, a little sister came in and said, "Everybody in this hospital is praying for you." [audience applauding] And she handed me a little book called Saint Anthony's Treasury. Saint Anthony was the worker of miracles, so I asked my business manager that if I carried out my will as I had requested, how much money would I have left? And he told me that, in cold hard cash, after taking care of everybody I had about three quarters of a million dollars left. So I proceeded to spend three quarters of a million dollars. [exuberant piano music] [audience applauding] And now, would you believe the second Hungarian "Three Little Fishies" rhapsody by Franz Liszt? This is Zsa Zsa's favorite one. [dramatic piano music] But I spent that three quarter million dollars not on myself, because I was a lost cause, but on other people. I bought presents like you wouldn't believe. [dramatic piano music] I bought my mother some beautiful jewelry, diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I even bought a house for somebody. I bought silver, motorcycles, automobiles. It took me about two weeks to spend my money until finally I was broke. Fortunately, as you know, I recovered. I left the hospital and I was home in time for Christmas. And then everyone was happy. [audience applauding] Thank you very much. Could you stand another one? I bet you thought it was another piano. Actually, it's a refrigerator and a freezer. This is the kitchen in my guest house and it's very useful, as you see. We've turned out some real symphonic food in this kitchen. [dramatic piano music] I suppose that as long as I do remain a bachelor, people are going to ask me why I have never married. I don't think too many people know this, but I come from a family of divorce and this has made an imprint on my mind. I probably would be very much like my brother George. George is happily married for the fifth time. I came awfully close to getting married two or three times, but some incident occurred, you know, which gave me a warning of what to expect and it kinda turned me off. [dramatic piano music] [audience applauding] Eh, how do you like this number? It's conservative, isn't it? Yeah. It's not the loudest one, but it's the most expensive. You know why? Because of the buttons. Yeah, they're real diamond buttons. Yeah, in fact the buttons cost more than the suit. But I couldn't come out just in the buttons. [audience laughing] Coax me. [laughing] I'll make that centerfold yet. You know what the gimmick is with the buttons. On each button there's a letter, see, and all together they spell out my name. That makes 'em deductible, yeah. [audience laughing] See, wanna see? Here's the L-I-B on this side, see? Here's the E-R-A and then the C-E is in the back there, see? Are you lookin' at the buttons? [audience laughing] I was just going to say I love this theater because you're all so close and I can hear all the things you whisper and everything. Now, all during the show I've been hearing little things like, could I see your rings? You wanna see 'em, do ya? Sure, don't be afraid to ask to see anything. [audience laughing] Sure. I'll be right over. It's a candelabra and that other thing is a watch. It's shaped like a piano, see it? Yeah, I got some more yet, this one. This one doesn't represent anything. It's just made out of the leftovers. [audience laughing] Yeah, thank you. You like it? [mumbling] Oh, listen, I'm glad you wanna see it because let's face it, you bought it. [audience laughing] Lemme show, you wanna see? Here you go. Yeah, the watch is underneath the diamonds. In case you have to tell the time, you press two diamonds, the lid opens up, see? Yeah. Keeps very good time. It's about 20 rubies 'til 11 diamonds. [audience laughing] yeah, lemme show the young man here. See what you get if you practice? [audience laughing] You like it? Hi. Yeah, I love yours, lemme see it honey. Oh, I love it, it's beautiful. It's gorgeous, that's a big stone, I love it. It's nice to have a big one if you have a choice, isn't it? [audience laughing] Yeah, it's gorgeous. My stones aren't large, but I didn't have to do anything to get mine. [audience laughing] [laughing] - [Woman] Can you open your watch? - Sure, you wanna see it open? There you go. There you go, that's pretty honey. Good, that's a start, then. Yeah, look at how the young girls are. I thought only the old ladies liked me. Ah, it's nice, well thank you very much. That was fun. Oh, lemme see, what's this here? Isn't that lovely? Oh, this I love that honey, whatever you're doin' keep doing it. [audience laughing] I love my work and I love to think that I make people happy through my work and the purpose of doing it, to make a living, has long passed. Let's face it, I can be just as happy with one million dollars as I can with two million dollars and as my mother often tells me, you can only wear one suit at a time, you can only live in one house at a time, you can only drive one car at a time and she's absolutely right. But I love doing my thing. It's not totally unselfish. It brings me great pleasure, too. It brings me great satisfaction. I have gone out on the stage feeling absolutely horrible, with a bad cold or a virus infection and there's a tremendous kind of natural adrenaline that happens when you walk out in front of an audience, the kind of thing that is almost therapeutic and quite honestly, I think if that were taken away from me, I would really lose the desire to want to live. Oh, my Levi suit was made by a designer in Greenwich Village in New York and he made it as a kind of a gag, you know, and he put it in the window and he said that everybody's ordering them and he can't make 'em fast enough. They all want the Liberace Levi's with the sparkles on 'em. The most elaborate car of my car collection is this custom landau Rolls-Royce limousine. It's the most elaborate and also the most expensive. There were only a few of these made and the thing that makes it so special is the landau top. Would you like to see how it works? I'll show you. Would you mind showing them how it works, Bob? [thudding] - [Woman] Hi! - [Liberace] Hi, how are-- [laughing] [women squealing] - [Woman] Oh, I saw you from a distance. - [Woman] How are you? - [Liberace] I'm fine, how are you? - [Woman] Oh, it's so nice to see you. - [Women] Can we please have your autograph? - [Liberace] Okay. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, I forgot to tell you, I sing this one, too. Yeah, uh huh. I don't sing good, but I sing sexy. Uh huh. Tom Jones, ptooey. [audience laughing] I'm only kidding. We're the best of friends. Honestly, I got to know Tom over in London. He was saying that now that he's kinda made it in show business, all those weird stories that are going around about him. So, I said, well don't talk to me about the stories, kid. [audience laughing] I've heard stories about myself that gave me ideas I never even had before. [audience laughing] Oh, dear. And that ain't all. I started 'em. This is car number three and as you can see, it has piano keys going all along the side of the station wagon. And the license number is one piano. The fourth car is a custom built Cadillac limousine, designed by Durham. There were two of these cars made. The other one was a bullet proof model designed for Lady Bird Johnson when Lyndon B. Johnson was President of the United States. It has some unusual appointments on the inside. Would you like to see them? I had a bar designed for this car by Coach Craft who does work on Rolls-Royces and it's quite unique in that the, I'm sorry, I'll have to do that over. And this is car number five. This is an English taxi cab. It's a 1957 and I bought it in London and I had it shipped to the states. I changed the color of it because the English cabs are black. The flooring is carpeted in red carpeting and the interior is also carpeted and the upholstery is black leather and the meter works and it's in the old English coinage, pounds, shillings and pence. I use this taxi to pick up guests when they come to visit me and it really kind of gives them a thrill when I pull up at the airport in this wonderful old cab. [zooming] This is car number six. This is car number seven. This is a new replica of a Model-A 1930 Ford Roadster. The number plate on this car is appropriately, I am cute. This is car number eight. This car is a Bradley GT. It's built on a Volkswagen chassis and it's a customized car. It's one of a kind, and in order to get in it, you put the window up like this. The interior is done in crushed velour. There are no doors on this car as you can see, so it's a little tricky getting in and out, but it's fun. Well, I showed you some of my pet toys and my cars and I've come to the conclusion that I'll have to put this little sign up somewhere in my home. The difference between men and boys is the price of their toys. What do you think about that?

Thank you, for me, for me? Thank you very much. Bless you. Thank you very much. Ciao! [dramatic music] [audience applauding] [audience cheering] [uptempo music] Whoo, it's hot. Boy, let me get this off. This is a heavy one. This one, this is the electric one and with all those wires and everything, it weighs about 35 pounds. Oh, glad to get that off. All my jackets are heavy because of all the embroidery and the jeweling. The coat that I wear in the beginning of the show is even heavier than that. It's made out of leather and jewels and fur and this one here weighs about 45 pounds. [grunting] That's a heavy one. But I only have it on for a few minutes and my shoulders sorta act as a hanger for it. Gotta get a glass of water. I think I would have loved very much to have children. Lemme get outta this gear. I'll be back. I love children and I wish I could adopt children like I adopt dogs because I think I would be a wonderful father. I wouldn't spoil my children, but I would share with them. I think I could give them a lot of love. These are some of my dogs. I say some because there's still a couple of more. Most of my dogs have been given to me by people who really didn't want them. This is Jacque and my heart went out to him because he was the scrawniest, but he's turning out to be one of the pretty ones. And this is Mischi, who was owned by a very nice-- [dog growling] This is Mischi who was owned by a very nice young lady and Mischi refused to stay home alone so she couldn't take her to work with him, so she gave her to me. This is Bonaparte. The people who had Bonaparte moved back east and they couldn't take their dog in the apartment so Bonaparte came to live with us. Lisa, come here Lisa. Come on, darling, come on. Lisa was sent to me all the way from Brisbane, Australia. She's two years old, now. Prego, come here Prego, come here Prego. Come on, come on love. [dog barking] This is Prego. He's a German Schnauzer with an Italian name, Prego, which means you're welcome in Italian. Elke, come here darling, Elke, come here. This is Elke. And if you haven't got people, well. If you love anything, they love you in return. It works with dogs as well as people. Wanna cookie? Here honey, have a cookie. [classical piano music]
