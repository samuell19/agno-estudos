MARIA'S TIGHTROPE Maria. Come on, sweetie. Maria, my child. Come on and bring your bag. Let's get going or we'll be late, sweetie. - See you later. - Bye. Maria, say bye. Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus. My stomach is killing me. Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore. But I'm not sure about my magic yet. Keep practicing, then. Watch out. Are you hungry, sweetie? I have some cookies here in my purse. So sweet! Keep this for me, dear. My word! These feet are killing me. If I only knew, I'd have changed shoes. My goodness. - Barbuda. - Number 70. Hold on, Foguinho. I'm looking for the place. Look, I did it! Didn't I tell you I had it? You'll be a great magician someday, honey. We're here, Maria. Number 70. - What floor? - Fourth. Shall we? Come on. Howdy, we're going up to see Mrs. Maria Cecilia. Let me see. Lovely. Come on. Hi. We're here. Here? - Let me see. - 403 We're here, sweetie. It's a party! Ring it. Come here. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Barbuda loves you. Barbuda, honey. Darling, I've missed you! It's Quico's party. He's staying with me for a while. Do you remember Quico? Why didn't you tell me she'd be arriving today? We thought it'd be better to wait a while. You could've told me. Mrs. Maria Cecilia, the circus is on the road. We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby. Nearby! We walked almost for two hours. - You live pretty far away! - Fine, I see. What really matters is that you're here, my doll. Let me look at you. You didn't grow much in these past fewyears. Let me see your face. Come on. You look so much like - Mrs. Maria Cecilia. Here are her things. - Is this all? - Yes, ma'am. Come on, Maria. - Darling. - Here, sweetie. Excuse me. Quico! Maria is here. - Look at her beard! - "Her"? Careful, kid! What, you think my wife's beard is fake? - Is she really a woman? - Yes, sir. Don't you mind that she has a beard? I sure don't. And she doesn't mind that I'm a fire eater. - You eat fire? - I do. Do it for us. Eat it! Eat it! Gather 'round for my amazing trick! I am about to take this wooden match and light it! Let's hear it! Eat more fire! Just one more time, if you please. Do not try this at home. It's dangerous. Playing with fire means you pee... In bed! Eyes on the fire. That's enough, Foguinho. We have a show tonight. Your stomach can't take this. He's not feeling well, kids. I have to call it quits! That hurt a little on the way out. - What's this for? - Careful! You're going to break it! - Don't pull it like that, son. - What's it for? For balance. Maria works with us in the circus. No, no. From now on, Maria doesn't work anywhere. She will simply study and play, right? What kind of work? She walks along a high wire, way up in the circus ring. That was in the past. This whole business about Maria in the circus is all done. She uses this parasol to help her balance on the tightrope. Are you her mother? No, I'm her godmother. - What about you? - I'm her godfather! Take our picture. Right, that's enough. Can you walk for us, just a little bit? Walk! Walk! Just a little bit, Maria. Please. Do you want to walk? Want to walk the tightrope? - Who likes magic here? - Me! You're about to see a trick by Foguinho the Magnificent. Wait right there. This is a very special box. It came from a very serious land. - Do you see anything inside? - No. It is a magic box, you see? When I go like this- A rose for the pretty girl! Can we get some applause, kindly? You'll share this room with Quico for now. This is all yours, my darling. Do you like the room? It's really high. Put your things away, darling. What is the matter? There's a whole closet just for you! We're used to it Mrs. Maria Cecília. At the circus, we don't get a lot of room. It doesn't matter, my love. We'll get you settled in later. There's no rush. Enjoy the party. There are so many kids here, and so many sweet treats. Go on over to the living room. Go play with Foguinho and the kids, sweetie. Barbuda will be right there. She's so quiet. She's been lately always thinking... - Thinking about what? - Like I'd know! She won't say a thing. It's like she's thinking really hard about something. We think... We think that Maria doesn't remember a thing. - What do you mean? - She won't talk about it. We tell her about things like you and your house, but all she says is I don't remember. Foguinho thinks she doesn't want to remember. If you ask me, she simply can't. What did she say when you told her it was time to live with me? She said she wants to stay in the circus forever. I see. We explained that this is not possible, 'cause she is too little to work by herself like that. She didn't like it one bit. I'm no educated woman like you, Mrs. Maria Cecflia, but I'm very candid and say what's on my mind. It's a crying shame that Maria can't stay with us. You're her grandma, and you have the right but I think she'd be happier with us. The magic rope trick requires great concentration. - Are you concentrating? - Yes! My assistant Maria will give me a hand for the magic rope trick. Maria, pull very hard. - Are you very concentrated? - Yes! Let go, Maria. Foguinho, we're late. There's a show tonight. Thank you. - Bye-bye. - Bye, kids. Is it time already? Show us another trick, Foguinho! No way, we have a show coming up tonight. Do the box again. Kids, didn't you hear me? We have a show tonight. Bye, kids. All the best. Everything will be okay, my sweetie. Give me a hug. Barbuda loves you. - Bye, kids. - Bye. Here. For you. Maybe you'll need it someday. It's yours now, Maria. We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay? Look out for her, Quico. Maria, let me go. Be good, sweetie. Bye, kids. My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you Come on and eat Maria. Do you still like chocolate milk? Yes. So... Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you? But it's so pretty. I've picked your school. I'll take you to meet the principal. She wants you to take a test. But I've always studied! In the circus? Mom taught me. Your mother was a great student. She'd be... I want to go back to the circus. I want to go home. Let's get Quico out of bed. I'll take you to the beach. No, I want to go home. Eat your bread. What are you looking at? Nothing. Do you see anything? I'mjust looking. Maria, when you're back in the circus someday, can you take me along? I want to see you walk the tightrope. Look, Marcia. I made this for you. It's beautiful. It used to be my favorite toy. Whenever it rained hard, I set it in the water to watch it float down the gutter. I stared as it floated away. Take me to the circus. What about your mother? She can't tell me what to do anymore. Going back still scares me. Maybe it's best if I keep as a painter. You're an artist. You belong in the circus. Young man, I regret to inform you that this love will not last. How do you know, mom? Have you ever truly loved someone? Mom, dad! Please. Promise me you'll never see my daughter again. A promise is only good if you shake on it. Don't squeeze that hard. Just promise you'll never see my daughter again. I promise. I promise that every morning, the first thing I want to see is Marcia and the last thing I want to see at night... is Marcia. I promise that I'll never let anyone get between us. Let my hand go! I promise to accept all we suffer together and truly enjoy all we live together. Let go! I promise to never think that I'm better than her nor that she is better than me. Marcia, tell this man to let my hand go. I promise to use my own life to give Marcia a good life. Don't squeeze it! And if I must, I promise to give my life to save hers. Get out at once! Marcia, where do you think you're going? I won't let you date any... low-class. Date? We're getting married, mom. I'll never let our daughter marry a worthless man. Hey, I'm right here! It's me! Mom, dad! I'm here! Maria! Maria! Get back, Maria. We're too far up! Don't yell, Quico. You'll wake everyone up. Get back here, please. Did you like the private tutor? Math is a little hard. If you have any trouble here in school, Maria, you can see me. Let's meet your classmates. - Come on. - Wait... Get the ball. You get it! This is howwe walk. Can I try? No, Quico! That's not how you do it. You look beautiful, beautiful... Frontwards, backwards, and slide... and a smile for the audience, you look great, perfect! I am ready to walk up there with you? The tightrope walkers, Márcia and Marcelo! - I Love you. - Me too. Barbuda, you look lovely. Let's get going now. We go in after the acrobats. Foguinho, relax or you'll throw me off. Go away, great. You look wonderful. Maria, my love! - Can I help you? - Hi. Grandma's here to see you. Give grandma a kiss. - Grandma? - I didn't know you. Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms. The showis underway. Please, get out. - I'm Marcia's mother. - What? My apologies. - I didn't know. - Thank you. Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit. I brought you some very tasty treats. Here. Do you like it? It's all yours. - All of it? - All yours. Your grandma will give you anything you want. It's our turn. Can you wait here? Marcia will be right over to see you. Great, thanks. Hang tight, sweetie. Mommy is on her way. The crowd is waiting, Barbuda! There's more here, darling. More? Yes, and it's all yours. Do you like it? Let's take a walk with grandma now. What about mom? Mommy is working. She'll pick you up later. Don't go! Maria! Where are you? Hold on, Quico. Come back already! Now you can blow out the candles. Should I make a wish first? Sure, my darling. Help! Get me away from here! Well done. Let's eat the cake now. Doesn't your doll get a piece? She doesn't know how to eat. You never talk to me. - Talk about what? - Anything. I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me. Tell me what's on your mind. - When? - Now. Where is my mom? Where is my dad? What? Where are my mom and dad? - Time for your presents! - Tell me, grandma. What, darling? Where are my mom and dad? I told you already. They left you with me. Your mom and dad have no time for you. On the other hand, grandma will make sure you never go wanting. - What's this? - A gift for you. - Another one? - Won't you open it? What is it? I picked something different, to see if you like it. You hardly ever play with your toys! This old lady is yours. When you feel like hearing a story, she will tell you one. We can get people as presents? She is the greatest storyteller around. Don't you like stories? When you're tired of reading, just say "tell me", and she will. Isn't that great? Talk to my grandchild. Hello. How do they call you? The Storytelling Lady. Grandma, you can buy people? - Is it expensive? - Depends, I guess. Are there people stores? There's no such thing, my angel. So how did you- You're impossible when you get something in your head! You want me to talk, right? Talk, not ask. It's time for grandma to get some rest. Stay here and play with your new toy. Don't be shy. When you want a story, all you have to do is ask. Bye. Don't you want to get out of the box? Can you tell me a story? People story or animal story? Happy or sad? A thriller, comedy or horror? Made-up or real? A story about people. Your story. Mine? - Don't you have a story? - Sure. - Can't you tell me? - I guess so. I was born, and I had a lot of brothers. My mother used to tell us stories so we should not think about eating. Then I grew up, got married and had a bunch of children. I told them the same stories my mother used to tell me. I grew old, my husband died and one by one, my kids went away. So I kept reciting stories aloud to myself. I told them in the streets. Some of the passers-by liked them and gave me some change. One day, your grandma came up to me and asked: "Would you tell your stories to my grandchild for food and shelter? She said I could eat myself sick, if I wanted. I agreed, so they put me in that box. Before they closed me up, I asked if I'd get paid on the spot. "Once my grandchild opens her present, you can eat," she said. Well, that's my story. May I eat now? - You may. - Now we're talking. I'll start here. This is good. Can you tell me why grandma married the 4 of them? Mrs. Maria Cecilia always liked to pick her husbands. She also liked to boss them around. She was so bossy that they all left. The one she really, truly loved was the one over there, with the mustache. Maybe because he was the one who picked her. Soon enough, she got bossy. Told him to get rid of the mustache and told him to stop working, which he didn't like. When he left her, he said: "I'll come back when you quit bossing me around!" Mrs. Maria Cecilia got really sad. She decided that from that point on, she'd care only for her granddaughter. Only her, and no one else. Me? - You. Can I have some more? - Sure. Are you okay? Wake up! Say something! Wake up! Grandma! Say something. What's the matter, darling? My present died. - How come? - She ate too much. She never had enough to eat, but there was too much here. Don't worry, my doll. Don't cry. Forget about it. No, grandma. I don't want to forget. Wake up, Maria. Get up already. Get up! What's the matter? - I'm leaving. - So soon, Quico? When are your parents coming for you? I don't know. Did you ask grandma? - Bye, Maria. - Bye, Quico. Don't step on the lines, Barbuda. Goodness, Maria! I don't know if I'll make it. Look, the cotton candy man. Spin it around. This one. - We have a winner. - Two reais. - It's cheaper in the circus. - Life is expensive these days. I want a piece of this cloud. Look at the seagulls, Maria! Can we shoo them away? - Want to get your feet wet? - Yeah. I've missed you so much! - Are you doing okay? - Yeah. - What have you been up to? - When? All this time! I've been looking out the window. The window? What were you looking at? Just looking, Barbuda. I see. How are you doing in school? The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda. Behind? How come? Didn't you showher how you can read? How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope. Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day? Don't worry, sweetie. You'll get the hang of it in no time. Don't worry about that. I miss you already! I hope the circus comes by Rio de Janeiro again. Next time, I promise I'll bring Foguinho. Come on, my tightrope walker. Barbuda. Can you take me up there someday? Ask your grandma. She'll take you. I want to go with you, Barbuda. Can you take me? - Mom! - Maria! My daughter. Where have you been? Maria, don't go! Don't leave me alone. - Dad! - Maria! - My baby, I missed you! - I'll tell Barbuda! Where did your grandma take you? Teach me how to walk on the tightrope. I want to be part of your act. - But you're so little! - Yeah, honey. Come on, please. Teach me! We'll think about it, okay? Always remember that. Aim at a spot ahead. Focus, and you won't fall. On the tips of your toes, then slide. Gently, just like that. Yes. Arms out and smile. Smile to the crowd that's here to see you. Good, Maria. Did you see, Marcia? Our little acrobat! Very good. Next, try it with the parasol. Grab it either here or here. Find the best grip. Elegance. Where's that smile for the crowd? - Beautiful. - Use your arms. Steady waist. She has a knack for it. She got it from you. Ladies and gentlemen! Gather round for the extraordinary debut of the world's youngest tightrope walker. Maria! Please talk to them Barbuda. Forget it, Foguinho. No time for changes now. The act hasn't been announced yet. - But we're set on it. - You can change your minds. Can't you see the place is packed, Barbuda? They're all here to see our act. Come on, Marcelo. - He can't make you do this. - Don't go, Marcia. - Is Maria in this? - Of course not, she's out. It's time, Marcelo. We'll be watching from the front row, okay? Come on. I'll never leave the circus again. I'll be with you. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Keep your hearts in check. At last, we have come to our finest attraction. The incredible tightrope walker couple: Marcia and Marcelo! See the heights they reach, ladies and gentlemen. Please, be absolutely silent. Tonight, they will perform without a safety net. I want to leave! Let me out, please! Let me out! No! Dear Barbuda, I received your letter, and loved the invitation. I wish I could go with you to stay with your brother in Bahia. Isn't he the fisherman who lives by the sea in the middle of a palmfield? But I can't go now. School is back, and grandma won't let me. But on my vacations, I want to see you, and Foguinho as well. Can you write me back? Can you tell me where the circus will be? Barbuda, I have something to tell you. I remembered everything. Everything. At least I know now. And as the days go by, I get more used to it. Kisses, Maria. Come on Maria, you don't want to spend your life on a tightrope... I like it, grandma. MARIA'S TIGHTROPE Done by (c) dCd / January 2014
