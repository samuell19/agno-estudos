What is behind you right now, so what's behind us right now? So, this for us NST-line 4 for so non-segregated tails. So, in the pipe, is sand, fines, water and some rock. A minor part of bitumen, but very minimal. So when you look at it, it doesn't look very appealing. No, it doesn't, but of all the unappealing things we uncovered while making this documentary about fossil fuels and climate change, this tailings pipe didn't seem so bad in the end. This empire has the ability to destroy life as we know it on this planet. I mean, the timelines on climate change are so short. A warming world is not a smoking gun for a CO2 catastrophe. It's possible. The creator might say: I want to start again. Canada does not have a long history of pulling its weight. If it doesn't get resolved, I don't know that the country can survive. I'll stop this province. I do not want this province to be polluted. So if you protest, you have to put your body on that machine in order to stop it. And I'm sorry to do this my friends, but time is important. Agents, you know better than that. He's trying to put a cell phone on my face. Please help me. You know that this is not right. You know that I shouldn't be treated this way. My friends, you have a moral imperative. We all live on this planet. Quit lying to yourselves... That's my point. It's to help you, stop, lying to yourselves. It really hurts. I'm sure you'll fix the eye-finger ... To Catherine Abreu: coming from Northern America. What do you think about how Canada is currently performing? Canada has never met a climate target that it couldn't miss. We've been setting climate targets in Canada since the early 1990s, and we've yet to meet a single one. And current projections show that we're off track to meet our 2030 Paris target. We, in Canada are one of those countries that is historically far more responsible for the problem of climate change and has economically benefited, from a ..., from the various economic models that have contributed to a warming planet. We are really avoiding addressing the overextraction and, and export of fossil fuels, from Canada. So by no means does our current climate plan actually deliver the level of ambition that we need, in order to do our fair share to confront the global challenge of climate change, but it gets the ball rolling. I think a big focus for us this week is going to be meeting with countries to have conversations about how addressing the production and supply of fossil fuels can be a bigger part of the conversation in this space. Talking about fossil fuels is something that countries don't want to do because they feel ashamed, because I, ... totally Meet Catherine Abreu. Catherine is the Executive Director of Climate Action Network, a coalition of more than 100 organizations working on climate change and energy issues in Canada. Catherine is an internationally recognized, award winning campaigner who is literally listed with the Pope as one of the world's 100 most influential people in climate policy. I met up with Catherine at the U.N. climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, where she was set to meet with youth, advise political delegates, and speak out on the global stage. We need transformational shifts, and that's going to look different for every country. Right. So it isn't necessarily that we're thinking of a baseline of three asks that we make of every country, but that we're thinking of what the most ambitious ask to make of every country is. And that's why I say, you know, there are several countries where the gap in ambition is directly related to the refusal to address the production and supply of fossil fuels, my country included. While Canadian companies are taking steps to reduce CO2 emissions, Catherine and her team still have their work cut out for them. We all know fossil fuels aren't going to go away tomorrow. But if we can't talk about it, then we're not going to be able to address this extremely serious issue that people are suffering from the world over. So, that's kind of where my energy is right now. A hard won lesson for many environmentalists is that facts don't change minds. So, while I think we have moved into a place where most people accept the science, it hasn't necessarily meant that everyone has made up their mind to do something about it. Climate change and global warming are perhaps the most pressing issues in the world right now, they're important to me, too. I have two children. I worry about their future, humanity, and the well-being of the Earth, like most people. In fact, I've been trying to create awareness around global warming since my Grade five science fair project back in the 80s. That's me, little Matthew Embry, before I started making investigative documentaries. My project hasn't made much of an impact because here I am in Germany three decades later, following Catherine as she tries to affect Canadian policy around this issue. I'm a Canadian too, and along with not reaching our emissions reductions targets, there have been other problems in our country due to climate change that I have witnessed first-hand. My hometown is called Calgary, it's located in the province of Alberta by the Rocky Mountains and global warming policies have had a chilling effect on the entire city. So this is your typical situation. This was a chemical company, it was, but... How many people would have been on this floor previously, Kendra? There would have been, you know, sort of north of 60 people. It's humbling. This floor has been vacant for... two and a half years now. In any normalized market, this is a pretty appealing offering because you have a basically a turnkey type solution where, move in, bring your personal belongings, bring in your computers, hook up your IT, away you go But even with the sort of plug and play situation, it's very hard to move space in town. This is definitely unprecedented. Vacancy downtown is just shy of twenty five percent. And to put that in perspective, in 2012, vacancy was two and a half percent. So, you know, 22% in this market, you know, you're looking at close to 10 million square feet of additional space, versus what was available seven years ago. To compare it to other cities, You know, Silicon Valley in the tech burst and then the financial crisis, which led to the auto industry issues so Detroit and Silicon Valley, their vacancies, when they peaked ... It's similar to where Calgary sits today, sort of just to put it into context, so, you know, we're dealing with a significant real estate issue. The question is, how do we fix it? We walk through space and you look at empty desks, these were viable employees. You kind of look where are they now? What are they doing now? If we have twenty five percent vacancy downtown, that's over 30'000 jobs that have vacated in the last four years. Where are those people now? There's all of these desks that are empty, there's chairs empty. Lots of empty office Towers. Even my Bow building is, is not full anymore. At that time, when we built it. We thought we were going to run out of space, but everything changed. Meet Quinn Morgan. This Alberta farm boy founded a Calgary based business that employs thousands of people, grew its operation internationally and was at one point listed as the number one company on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is my history section. I've been given the number of honorary degrees, Universities. That just happens to be my Alma Mater on there in Alberta. And ... that's from Stephen Harper, congratulating me on my order of Canada. I was saying at home, how proud I was, to be a Canadian and do what I could for, for the country in my own way. And and so it was a recognition that, that I'd done OK, and it was very special. Albertans are resilient, you know, they're hard to keep down, you know. If they push them in one way and they come up somewhere else. They figure out a way. But today in Alberta. I've never seen these resilient hard-working people so down. They just have almost given up hope. And you know the worst thing of all, whatever is, whatever has happened to you, physical, whatever, is when you lose hope. We got Dwayne on line 20. Go ahead. Hey Danielle, here's something right today in my job. I have to lay off 25% of my Workforce ... Oh man ... Right before Christmas ... What kind of what kind of work are you in because we've been talking about the Oil field Services guys on the front, on the front lines. That's where you are. Wow. And I love my guys, and you know what? I gotta lay off ... I got to lay off 25% of these guys. They made ... Yeah ... they made between 70,000 and a hundred grand a year ... I got to get rid of three million dollars. Do you know what my bosses are saying 3 million dollars, like they're not people. And, and they're going home to tell their wives tonight. Christmas is over, and you know what, we got nothing, and my bosses are trying to save other people's jobs. They're not trying to save their own, because you know what, we're management. We've taken a 40% pay cut, so we can keep as many people employed as we can. And today, I gotta break people's hearts. And I gotta tell them that you're no longer useful to us, ... because of money! This is what socialism does everybody. They're chasing out investment. This is Venezuela coming, and you don't think it's happening, and it can't happen in Canada folks? Open your eyes, because this is just the beginning. It's the frustration of these guys who? Well, they just they just want to work. They just want to take care of their families. And they don't they don't know if they'll ever be able to work in their field again, you know these phone calls, its a ... You know those people telling me that they're they have contemplated suicide. So when you don't have a job and your marriage breaks down or you don't have a job, so you get into a drug or alcohol addiction, or you get into drug or alcohol addiction, and it causes you to have domestic violence. Like all of these social issues are interconnected. We've got a huge social crisis that is only going to grow, if you don't have people able to take care of themselves. And these are, these again are all people who are willing to. They want to take care of themselves, but they've got Governments making decisions that are standing in the way of the economy getting back on track. And that's, that's to me, the greatest frustration. It was because they ... I do know that if certain decisions could get made at the provincial level, at the federal level, that we'd be able to flip that switch back on again. Because I've seen it, I've seen us be able to recover from these kinds of, of downturns, but this one feels like it's possible that we move on to cover from it. Floor after floor of these towers are empty. Downtown windows are covered with "For Lease" signs and unemployment numbers continue to rise. This is not the Calgary, Alberta, I grew up in, this was a vibrant and growing city. The home of the world-famous Calgary Stampede and the 1988 Winter Olympics. Calgarians were celebrated for their entrepreneurship and can-do attitude. Calgary is often listed as one of the best cities to live on the planet. So how did we get here? How did Calgary, a city that was once experiencing record growth and prosperity, transform into a city of anxiety and despair, in less than five years? Well, here's the backstory: Calgary is fundamentally and economically fueled by the oil and gas industry. Ever since Leduc number one started producing in 1947, things have more or less been on the upswing but the province really hit Pay Dirt with the development of the Athabasca oil sands, estimated to be the third largest oil Reserve in the world. For more than half a century Calgary companies and citizens have been drilling Wells, laying down pipelines selling fossil fuels building high-rises and suburbs, two-stepping and flapjacking, and raising families. People from all over Canada would flock to the industry. It was a liquid gold rush, but for now that rush is over. Obviously the world oil price collapse was a devastating blow. But we'd all been through that before, you know, eventually it changes. But, what's really happened is we've gone into another period of political purgatory for the industry. They were projecting that we could be 7 million barrels per day producer. This is part of the reason we had so many pipeline projects that were on the go. Northern Gateway and Keystone and the Energy East and Trans-Mountain. It seemed like it was going to be Skies the sky's the limit and all we needed to do is just make sure we had the pipeline takeaway capacity to continue to develop it. We've got a government that's ideologically opposed to the oil and gas industry, where emissions reduction, trying to do something about climate change if you like, at least, that was the ostensible reason, trumped everything else. One of the biggest places that it's been seen, is the pipelines. Alberta's land locked. And there's our major problem. An enormous amount of oil and gas that we produce is landlocked in Alberta without new pipelines. And Calgarians, like their crude, are taking it lightly. We haven't been building pipelines. Resource investment has absolutely collapsed, and, you know, all of Canada should be incredibly concerned and I think we're building up momentum next all the good work you're doing, and all the good work that Geoffroy, Fox is doing you know, Cody batters Hill is the founder of Canada action, a Grassroots movement, encouraging Canadian citizens to take action and support the Canadian oil sands and energy sector. I guess when you're going to do a march, you get a lot of police, eh. Thanks for coming, appreciate it. We've seen images of protests against pipelines across the country. Cody and his team have organized a rally for Calgarians to show support for pipelines. Here is a fact: When you're blocking any oil pipelines, you are harming the global environment, because other countries will take our market share, and our families have seen the repercussions of this economic downturn. We're going to do a march! A march for prosperity, a march for pipelines, a march for our natural resource sector! A choking, that solidary proud Canadian families are very bad at living, in the natural resource sector! The Trans Mountain pipeline would run from Alberta through the province of British Columbia to the West Coast. It's one of the many pipelines that could bolster Calgary's economy, but its construction and the construction of other pipelines have been halted by politics and environmental activism. Cody is as pro Canadian Oil and Gas as it gets, and his activism has resulted in online abuse, and death threats. This absolutely puts fuel in the tank, you know. It's hard sometimes, because there's a lot of barriers. There's a lot of frustration. There's a lot of negativity, a lot of attacks, personal attacks and everything else. But, you know when you see this, you just know it's all worth it. You know, it's really all worth it for the global environment, for our families and our economy. So yeah, we're super happy today. Look at these beautiful wind turbines. They're gorgeous ... I know a lot of people who are struggling with the ways in which that sector has been impacted. Because of the shift in global oil prices and the loss of jobs that Alberta has experienced recently. And I, I like feel that on a, in a personal way. I have so much empathy, and I think when we see the world moving to a clean energy future, we're not having a conversation about how we have a really prepared and planned-for transition in Canada's energy sector, that protects workers and communities. In order to make this transition real, we're going to have to build a bunch of electricity transmission East to West in Canada, so we can get all that good renewable energy flowing across the country and like guess what the exact same skill set for building a pipeline is required to to build an electricity transmission line. And this kind of suffering that we've been seeing for the last couple of years in Albertan communities is going to worsen. It's not easy to imagine, that things could get worse for Calgary, but it is a possibility. Because if we don't do what we need to do to address climate change, we're just not going to keep being able to live in Canada, and the ways that we're used to. And if we don't figure out how to make that transition happening, for Andrews' energy sector the future prosperity and job creation in Canada is at risk. I look forward to the day where Canada is covered in wind turbines and solar panels in the same way that Germany is. About ten, almost 10 years ago. There was a group of environmental very rich environmental groups. Like Rockefeller Brother's foundation and a few ... Hewlett Packard Foundation or former owners of Hewlett-Packard; number of others, put hundreds of millions of dollars into a campaign, the landlocked Tar Sands campaign. And they, they actually had a strategy to dock it. They published it, and it's available for people to look at. When I got back into radio is when I found out about the, a … Tar Sands Campaign which began in 2008 I saw the documents for it. So there's a PowerPoint presentation where they went through, and the purpose of it was to demonize Alberta oil sands and Canadian Oil in particular. So Greenpeace was one of the organizations that was most involved in exposing the tar sands on the global stage, in exposing the massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions that come out of the tar Sands. In showing the world what's happening there. The images, the tailings ponds, the huge removal of forests, the toxic emissions. We've been very involved in that and that's been a game-changer, really, I know for Alberta, but, and also for for Canada and the global climate movement. To understand the severity of what's happening there. Oh, well, one of the things they said right in their … manifesto they put together, was that they would also engage the celebrities, you know, they were mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio coming because of the oil sands, and he did. I've personally flown DiCaprio, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Bill Nye, the Science Guy, just all sorts of documentary teams from BBC, and Sierra Fund, the World Wildlife Fund. We fly for everybody, and we have some people here recently from a news outlet in England. Well, I asked him, I said, why are you here? Why, why protest the environmental record and what's going on … in Fort McMurray? Why not Russia or Venezuela? Or why don't you go and protest coal-using generating stations in China? And the simple answer is, is because either they'll be arrested and put in jail in Siberia or somewhere in China … or they'll be shot, or they'll just disappear ... The celebrities are usually being hosted by somebody who already has an agenda with one of the anti- oil-sands or anti-oil in general people. They have these ideas in their mind, and they look out of the helicopter and try and find something that validates what they think they already know, but you look at these dead trees, they'll say: these dead trees … you know, like the oil sands destroyed that … No, that was a fire in 2011 that did that. So it looks like a lot of smoke coming up by those all those little round units. That's just steam evaporating in the sky. Those are heat-exchangers. So, people take pictures, then say it's pollution. A lot of folks who come here to protest, never look past the production of the material. And really, oil sands or any oil production or any mining activity is not a supplier issue. It's a consumer issue. You know, look at these highly toxic tailing period Gold and Silver mines and Lithium, all the chemicals that we extract from the Earth to make batteries, are lifestyle chainable. and even you know, jewelry. Well, if we didn't buy it, nobody would produce it. Though, it's not really a production problem, it's a consumption problem. But how do you tell people in LA or New York: well, you shouldn't have any jewelry you should'nt be wearing synthetic clothing and you shouldn't be driving a car, and your goods shouldn't be delivered in a diesel-powered tractor-trailer ... That conversation. Nobody wants to have that one. After his helicopter tour with Paul Leonardo DiCaprio compared the Alberta oil sands to Mordor from Lord of the Rings and his analogy and tweet made headlines all over the world. Dramatic images of the oil sands tailings ponds and open pits appeared in blogs, magazines, newspapers, documentaries, and a spread in National Geographic. The tar Sands campaign was a success and Alberta oil was branded dirty oil, across the country and around the world. Everyone knows that the tar Sands is controversial. Everyone knows that these pipelines are controversial. I think there's a lot more public knowledge now, about the risks the pipelines and the tar Sands both, but also about the, the tie between pipelines and tar Sands, and increasing global emissions. And that is in part the work of Greenpeace and other organizations. Everything that we do is, it's meant to expose the reality and, and help people to understand the situation at hand. We will show you some of our own reclaimed facilities, but you're going to drive through literally acres and acres of reclaimed site going down. And it looks like any national park. People just choose what pictures they show. Eager to fix the Public's perception of the Alberta oil sands development. One of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, Canadian natural resources limited gave us unprecedented access to tell their side of the story. My favorite vision, my vision for tailings ponds is a, well and it will return to lakes is, is Parks and because that's in essence ... that is what they that is what they end up as. Looking forward to the day to ... well, I probably won't be around but nonetheless, my grandchildren could come and play. We were given a standard media tour that included some reclaimed areas and a compensation lake they had built. But then they got serious about transparency and took us right to the source of some of the oil sands' most controversial images. Really haven't invited a lot of media here to have these discussions, and I think that's part of the "you got to get the message out". So people understand what we're doing how we're doing it. So behind me is an image that's often portrayed on social media and, … and the news. And the words I hear things like toxic tailings pond. Those are the words that I hear. Realistically, what's in this pipe for us, is sand, fines water, and some rock. A minor part of bitumen but very minimal. So when you look at it, it doesn't look very appealing. How toxic would that be? It's the … This has actually had, we actually add captured CO2, that we capture from our hydrogen plant, to this, and when we add CO2 to the water to help this settling take place. It actually brings it back to a pH of 7 which is equivalent to River water. So, if we went for a swim in this, it would be a little bit dirty, but it's not, and I wouldn't drink it, but it's not it's, it's fine. I mean, I need a bath. And if I go play in the mud puddle with my grandchildren, I need a bath if I go play in this I would need a bath, but it's not going to harm me. So obviously not potable water. Neither is a mud puddle. This is a great big mud puddle. But when you, when you swing around and you go ... I'll take you over to this area. So over on this side is the exact same material that was going through that, that pipe there but was coming out of the pipe up top here. So the exact same Tails coming out. The difference is: we haven't poured from here in three weeks. So in three weeks the sand, the fines have settled out. What happens is the water, rolls off the top and you can see it off in the distance. And then we pick the water up at our siphon intake, so all of our water is reused. But it's a complete different picture. If you show the two of these side by side, it's different than social media portrays us, and to me, not bad to be around. Our next stop was the open pit mines. Remember when we were at the at the tailings ponds, and we looked at the long long white beaches. This is what it began with. So, those long white beaches. The sand grains are inside of this oil sand and during the process. What we do, is we remove the bitumen from the sand. And those long white beaches are the sand grains that remain behind. And so, when they're talking about what goes back into this pit, we took this out of this pit, we removed the oil from it, but before it's reclaimed what goes back in here is the sand without the bitumen. So we actually clean up the oil from here and ship that out as product, and we turn the clean sand here then cover it and reclaim it. Filming near the open pit was uncomfortable. It was windy, dusty and hot. The enormous size of the machinery and the scale of the operation was surreal. It's hard to imagine that this mine could have looked like this. And even harder to imagine, that this tailings pond could one day look like this ... Mining is not pretty, and the scope of a project with a hundred year timeline, is impossible to capture in one National Geographic photo. That's Alberta's predicament. For now, further transportation of Alberta's oil and gas is stalled without new pipelines, while the world's demand for fossil fuels continues to grow. And tankers from Saudi Arabia line up in the port of Montreal to fulfill Canada's own unquenchable thirst for oil. It's curious, that I've never seen DiCaprio taking a helicopter ride over a Saudi facility like this. Or facilities like these … What we're seeing right now, is a strategy from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. To block the reference of the 1.5 report. So there's this like consistent effort to water down. Yeah, the climate science. It really hurts, the impression that we might have, about the importance of the IPCC in policymaking so ... which is crazy because the IPCC report which landed in October has like completely changed the way in which the world is talking about climate change … Yes. Climate change activists often refer to the IPCC. The intergovernmental panel on climate change, is the United Nations body for assessing science related to the issue. The place where I get my knowledge is largely from the intergovernmental panel on climate change the IPCC, that's where the world scientists come together to compile all of the science from different corners of the world into these large reports that give us a really accurate look into what's happening. How the global temperatures are rising. What that means for different parts of the ecological systems across the planet. The IPCC recommends policies for governments. And UN conferences like this one, that Catherine and 6,000 other attendees are here for, are focused on whether or not to implement and promote those recommendations. This is like real push-pull between the politics of the moment and the ongoing technical negotiations in this space that are like setting the rules that the countries who are playing in this political space are agreeing to live by when it comes to climate change internationally. Canada is one of the countries promising to play by these rules and Alberta's fossil fuels likely aren't part of the long-term plan. However, climate change science and politics aren't the only reasons that pipeline development has been stalled in Canada. Right here. See the stick. See ... look at it ... Here ... Here, its level. When it come here, watch it's going to hit me. See it jumping, come back. Here you go. There's the water. There's an underwater stream here. There's an eagle feather. I'm speaking with the power that I get from there. It gives me the truth. You can have progress. There's nothing wrong progress, but do it on a scale that's going to be not harmful to the environment. Your biggest thing is the First Nations' concern about the environment. What are you doing about the environment? If you harm it, any way, then your project, it's not much good. We will ... we don't want to see it. Take it back to ... wherever you dreamed up this concept. Take it back to Europe or in the States ... Keep it there. When Europeans came, aboriginal peoples were here and they were never conquered, and we then have this Royal Proclamation of … The Royal Proclamation 1763 and the fundamental treaty. The first treaty, Treaty of Niagara 1764. We have a treaty making process, that is to provide for orderly development and settlement of the lands of Canada. A peaceful settlement. And once the treaties are signed, they are to be respected. They’re legal instruments, they’re protected in the Constitution. We know that on several occasions, during the hearings for C48, and told him that we were never consulted. Senators didn’t realize that there were 31 communities that actually supported Northern Gateway. There are industry leaders who didn’t realize there were 31 communities that supported Northern Gateway. The Canadian public did not know that 70% of the First Nations along the right away in Northern Gateway approved the project and were willing to sign on as owners. That's the biggest amount of support you could have for any project. Unlike many countries, Canada's constitution gives indigenous groups the ability to challenge industry development, until they have had proper consultation. There are over 600 recognized indigenous groups in Canada, and although many have supported the growth of ministry through the consultation process, others have not. I don’t trust consultation, so … wait. Nothing against whites, but just the white guy that comes in and say we’re going to consult with you. He's making the rules… He makes the rules. Don't forget it’s Canada. There is no judge sitting over there defending the Anishinabek side of the issue. We gotta deal with the… with the Government issues, the white issues, the way they think, their law. Ray owl is one of the founders of the traditional ecological knowledge elders group. This Ojibway activist has spent years protesting the impacts of industry on First Nations land. Here, mankind does not have the authority to take one species away to make something else. You’re going to get totally against with what the creation has for us. What we got to share, slowly depleting, being stolen. Don’t forget I changed my wording … stolen! Stolen is a very harsh word! There's … there is that: pressures between a western world view of resource development, job creation, royalties, and revenues, and an indigenous perspective, Mother Earth. A circular perspective, and one that is more in harmony I think, those are the teachings I perceived. More in harmony with the seasons, the passing of the days. Less in harmony with watching the clock and the watch every minute … And that’s what we’re that’s… that’s the real challenge in this country we call Canada. Because I can tell you when it comes to justice for First Nations people in this country. It takes a long time, even in the court system. You have a right to come into the courts. You would make an application for an injunction. You would argue that you were not properly consulted. You would have to speak as one voice. You file your papers in the court and you go before a judge. The judge will be likely non-native. Governments don't like this. They don't like being brought into court. We mean business. We've always been timid. Timid, this is you know almost like you're you're cowering. You're cowering to say no. Our lawyer says: how much money you looking for right? You guys don’t have enough money. Both you and Canada don’t have enough money for what the damage you’ve done for the last 50 years. Oh my God there’s not enough money in anybody’s pocket… to compensate the First Nations. What would you do? We’ve had the government by the balls. Probably the most important word in this room today is reconciliation. Ultimately I think to get to reconciliation. It’s a distant goal step by step by step, but ultimately to get there you’re looking at consensual agreements along the way… If that's the new reality in this country, then it’s the new reality under something that, from about what I’m speaking about: the rule of law, legal principles handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada, and the impact of section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982. And now worldwide, the United Nations declaration of the rights of indigenous peoples. A lot of this sounds to me like it's rooted in justice. Canada is changing and it’s clear to me that a combination of constitutionally based indigenous issues, and climate change based activism has more or less shut down Canadian pipeline development and scared away foreign investment. What’s stifling our fossil fuel industry means for the rest of the country, is hard to predict. Canada might be headed down a lonely road. I traveled to Texas with my friend Jeremy who works in the Canadian oil patch. Jeremy introduced me to Brad, an American counterpart who showed us vast oil fields and huge industrial development. You guys really have an uphill battle. I mean here, you know, they made the decision when they saw the amount of volume of oil that was coming out. Six big Pipelines applied for permits, and within two years they were they were working, building them. I think there’s two of ‘em that came online already, and another four that’ll be online by the middle of next year… and once that happens, I mean. I think you’ll see a second or maybe third boom here because … really, I mean there’s no reason to spend the money bringing wells online, if you have nowhere to send the oil. Much like your situation in Canada, you have the oil but you can’t get authorization to build pipelines to get it out of there. The US is no longer part of the Paris climate agreement. Their fossil fuel industry is booming and experiencing exponential growth. They are well on their way to becoming the world’s top producer of oil. So I think it’s shocked the world. I don’t think anybody thought the US would be one of the largest exporters, soon to be the largest exporter of oil and gas. You got any concept of how many wells there are in Texas, total? It’s gotta be hundreds of thousands… don’t think maybe even close to a million. I wouldn’t doubt it it’s gotta be… I mean, there’s wells everywhere … Without the pumpjack, I mean we would have never had access to the energy that we had over… over our lifetimes, right? Yeah, when I look at this, I see a lot of seat of the pants innovation. That to me illustrates a lot of people that work their asses off to get to this point. Texas fossil fuel production is intense. Pumpjacks, fracking operations and enormous flares were not hard to find, and pipeline development seems unaffected by activists. The protesters that were protesting the Keystone pipeline, when they found out that Apache was going to develop fields near and around the Balmorhea Springs, which is South of here, they made an attempt to make a statement and they came down and camped out. It was like a week’s worth of camping. Basically it was too hot for them and they weren't getting the type of coverage that they wanted and the quantity of coverage they wanted so… They literally packed up and went home. I think most people know this is an oil and gas producing state … but we have a substantial amount of wind power and solar power here in in Texas. So we’re in the middle of the Texas desert and there’s a massive solar project… right and that is supplying power to all of the … all the industry in the sites rather than to population. I mean, you can see those lines that are shining right there, they’re brand new… Yeah, oh for sure. I mean, this whole, this is everything, all these silver towers are all absolute brand new. You don't build the type of transmission infrastructure like you see behind me here, if you're if you're not planning on delivering power somewhere for a long time into the future. A solar farm filling the needs of the oil and gas industry is something we rarely hear about… But it’s a clear sign to me, that fossil fuel development in Texas will continue for decades, and then, a mix of energy sources will likely be the way forward for the US. In 2019 wind power surpassed coal, and accounted for more than 22% of the electrical needs in Texas. Surprisingly, a larger percentage than in Germany, the country that has long been hailed as the environmental leader for other countries to aspire to. My name is Fritz Vahrenholt and I’m the CEO of the German Wildlife Foundation. Meet Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, he’s also an author, a former advisor to the IPCC, and was the CEO of a wind turbine company in 2001, as the German government was embarking on a vigorous plan to transform the country’s energy sector by phasing out coal and nuclear, and replacing them with renewable energy sources. 15 years ago in Germany or 20 years ago, nobody was supporting renewable energy. And I said OK let’s do that because 10%, maybe 30% of our energy system can also rely on renewable energy like wind turbines. Nobody wanted to hear that, so I was also in those days let's say an outlier or outlaw … But today, they all think we can do it with 100%. And I say: look, 30% is good, 20% is better, 50% is very costly, very expensive, and beyond 50%, the system will breakdown. I have built thousands of wind turbines. I know the volatility. That we have in winter times, high winds, and produce two thirds of the wind energy. But in summer there is nothing, and on the other hand photovoltaics … you know. We have from May until September a lot of sun, but in winter, nothing. And therefore, this can be solved by storage yes. But not the storage which we know from batteries, from this day to the other, no … We need inter-annual, inter-seasonal storages, which is totally un-economic with batteries. The best thing is to have is a stable mix, the best parts of that and the best part of that … But today, nobody will hear that. Although the German government and private investors spent billions of Euros on solar and wind technologies, … the country has been unable to phase out coal, will not reach their 2020 emissions targets, and only about 35% of their energy comes from renewables. But not meeting the targets is not the only problem they have encountered in their attempted transition. And in Germany you see, the country is falling apart. We have now the highest prices of electricity in Europe. The people in Berlin and Hamburg all say: “we want more of these wind turbines” And meanwhile, we have 1000 initiatives, protests against wind turbines in the countryside. The people in the landscape know better. They have the noise in their ears, because within 500 meters they are living. Because they see the birds under the wind turbines. We have investigated in Germany. If you … we have 29,000 turbines and we kill every year 12,000 birds. Eagles and … important birds. We kill 200,000 bats in Germany by wind turbines. And now we have investigated they are killing also insects. So it is not per se "eco-friendly" what we are doing there … So that is nothing the young people surrounding Greta want to hear … The photos remind me of the pictures I’ve seen of dead birds after an oil spill used in environmental campaigns. I can’t recall ever seeing the casualties of wind turbines. Perhaps controlling the image is vital in controlling the message. Greenpeace was founded on ... by journalists, really. It was founded by journalists who were really aware of the need to bring images to people to change their minds, and to make them understand things. So you know one of the most iconic images that came out of Greenpeace in the early days … was Greenpeace activists on an inflatable Zodiak, between a huge industrial whaling ship and a whale. That, that action was an action of protection of that whale you know, but it was also a way to make the world understand what was happening there. The scale of it, the severity. This is me driving the first boat into the encounter with the Soviet factory whaling fleet in 1975. This is off California, about 50 miles, all off, open off the horizon. This one is me sitting on the baby seal, being arrestested off the east coast of Labrador, just North of Newfoundland that was 1978. This is my credentials up here. I’ve got a Doctor of Science in Ecology here, and an Honorary Doctor of Sciences from North Carolina State University. They didn’t give me a plaque or anything, but I was awarded the National Award for Nuclear Science and History in 2009 … in Albuquerque New Mexico near the, Los Alamos. I was quite proud of that ‘cause I’m in in the same group as some pretty heavy duty scientists: Oppenheimer … those kind of people. Here we’re being made into brothers of the Quag Youth or Namgis as they’d be called now at Alert Bay. I heard about this little group that had started to meet regularly in the basement of the Unitarian church, which was in the process of planning a voyage to Alaska to oppose US hydrogen bomb testing, and I wanted to do something real. I was studying ecology and had books and, and that, but I wanted to get up out of my chair and go out into the world and do something. So, I joined that group and was accepted as the ecologist on the crew. We sailed to Alaska, made World News, and President Nixon canceled the hydrogen bomb tests. So Greenpeace began with a major victory over the most powerful institution in the world, the US Atomic Energy authority. I stayed with Greenpeace for the next 15 years after I graduated from UBC. So I came straight out of a PhD in ecology, into an environmental activist role, and was instrumental in founding the international organization. In the mid to late 70s there was a threat that Greenpeace would break up into a million pieces because of various egos and etc… And so I … I forced the legal settlement of Greenpeace which became Greenpeace International, then stayed with that as one of the six Directors for the next six years till 1986, when I decided to leave, because I didn’t like what Greenpeace was turning into. One way of putting it is: organizations like Greenpeace often start out with good intentions, with volunteers. There’s no financial interests in the situation and … but gradually as they grow and are successful, they evolve into a kind of business; where you have a payroll to meet every month because you got 20, 40, 80, 100, … pretty soon 2000 people on staff. So now you’ve got hundreds of millions of dollars involved in this "business." So you’ve basically gone from being a volunteer group of hippies, to being a big business. And, unfortunately the big business sometimes evolves even further into what is basically a racket. Morning, We hear of two solutions to this coming apocalypse. The Paris treaty, green new deal. All this, is supposed to reduce carbon dioxide, you know. What does that mean? We have actually, we have inadvertently through our use of fossil fuels, in the same way that calcifying green organisms inadvertently by making armor plating for themselves basically threatened the end of life, by taking all the CO2 out of the system. We have inadvertently, by burning the fossil fuels and putting the CO2 back which plants took out in the first place to make coal and oil and gas, we’re putting it back and are actually restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle. Dr. Patrick Moore, the former president of Greenpeace, is about to go into a congressional hearing, to argue that burning fossil fuels and CO2 emissions are a good thing for the planet. But I particularly know that I’m right on the fact, that we are restoring balance to the global carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels. So we are life’s salvation, not it's destroyer. And that is going to maybe take a long time to sink in, but it is true. Well, good morning and welcome to our panelists. The administration’s shortsighted plan to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement will set back global action on climate change, further exacerbating the extinction crisis. While the current Canadian government considers the CO2 science surrounding climate change settled. The debate in other jurisdictions continues. And despite what we’re told, there’s a vigorous debate within the scientific community, over how human activity compares with vastly more powerful natural influencers, that have driven climate change for four and a half billion years. The scientific evidence is unequivocal. Marine biodiversity has been impacted at unprecedented rates by human activity. The last time this happened it was because an asteroid hit the planet. Today we are that asteroid. As with the manufactured climate crisis, they are using the spectre of mass extinction as a fear tactic to scare the public into compliance. There is no hard evidence that CO2 has anything to do with the changing temperature of the earth’s climate. And there is strong evidence, that we are seeing increases in extreme weather events. More heat waves,more droughts and more floods. And there’s no question it is promoted by greenhouse gas emissions. I go back to 1960s and show that from overpopulation deforestation global cooling resource scarcity, no matter the environmental scare, the solution was always the same. Wealth redistribution, central planning and sovereignty limiting treaties. I’m here to tell you that the three top officials from the UN are part of this con … First let me comment that IPBES is not a UN body, it’s a truly independent intergovernmental body. These are the words of a salesman a science bureaucrat, not a … dis… I’d like to ask the witness to direct your testimony to the chair … Sure! … not to your faction… Dr. Watson, these are the words of, not a scientist but of a science bureaucrat, doing the bidding for his organization. Coal reefs are projected to decline to 1% at 2 degrees warming. Along coastlines, the upsurge in extreme climatic events and sea- level rise will cause further loss of habitats. CO2 is the most important food for all life on earth, and we, thankfully are putting some of the CO2 back into the tub … Thank you Dr. …. that was sucked out by life over the millennia and are restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle … Thank you Dr. Moore. If there’s no further business, this committee stands adjourned. Thank you. It was one of the most bi … bipolar hearings I’ve ever heard. The last place you go, to find out the truth, is a congressional hearing. These are Kabuki theater member’s posture, and sort of set up their statements for that there’s a floor dissem… Average people are getting sick and tired of the doomsday claims around climate change 'cause they can see, that it isn't getting worse in any way. What we need is a constructive conversation. And I’ve chaired not only IPBES but IPCC. And there is no question that these increased gases are indeed leading to human induced climate change. A lot of the way this climate change crisis narrative is put forward is to ignore anything that brings it into question … and basically say you're a science denier if you bring anything into question … And then just repeating over and over and over again, that CO2 is the problem. What the atmosphere cares about, is emissions, and what we’re putting up into the atmosphere and it’s going to react, it’s, it’s a very brutal logic. Carbon logic is is very, very strong, very powerful and it’s not going be affected by rhetoric, and it’s only action … Yeah … And so he’s been at this for so long and works with the union of concerned scientists. What's your first response to climate science skeptics ? Well, I mean the first the first response is to present the facts to what they’re doing. To point out sometimes to their industry funding. Many of them are funded by the fossil fuel industry, to go out and and put out their disinformation. And … and to basically remind people of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that’s reflected in the IPCC reports, or our national climate assessment report by 13 federal agencies. This is not some conspiracy by the international scientific community. This is what science is supposed to do … Yeah … is, is put forward hypotheses, test them in the acid of a peer review and put forward the best understanding of the science for policy makers to consider, and the IPCC has done a tremendous job over 30 years. The IPCC documents are the Bible of the global warming community. People say: well, the science is settled. Well, the science is never settled. And this idea of a consensus is silly. Science is never, should never be done by consensus. You know, we have to move forward with our understandings. We have to test hypotheses … and it’s remarkable what we can learn by having an open mind, thinking outside the box, and problems are solved that way. If you want to come over here, we can sort of look at the layout of the lab. We’ll go in and visit this, but it's an accelerator mass spectrometer. We installed this five years ago and it’s an instrument for measuring radiocarbon amongst other things, and radiocarbon is of course a very important tool for dating in the geosciences, but it's also a tracer, and remarkably, it's been one of the key tools that we use to see how long CO2 lasts in the atmosphere. OK. So welcome to the accelerator mass spectrometer laboratory. We use the adage, that: the more trace the isotope you’re looking for, the bigger the machine you need. So we’ve got a 25 meter long machine here, with an 18 ton magnet to bend our ion beam, and a very sensitive detector. When we measure radiocarbon in atmospheric CO2, we can see how long it takes to cycle that. It turns out it’s cycling very very quickly, about every four years the entire inventory of atmospheric CO2 turns over. We can measure that here. Meet Ian Clark. Professor Clark is the director of the environmental science program at the University of Ottawa. For more than a decade, Dr. Clark has questioned the computer modeling that is used by many of the climate change scientists in their research. Well, I guess many people have been talking about the evidence for links between CO2 as a greenhouse gas and temperature and a… There is zero evidence for it, except models. And models are based on the hypothetical link, the climate sensitivity … right … which is under reevaluation. By the scientists, by the modelers themselves. But you never hear about this in the media … In fact, the IPCC has, in their science report demonstrated, you read it. You see, all these guys really don't know what the sen… what the climate sensitivity is. We have to challenge paradigms. And if we're always coming up with more evidence to support the one hypothesis … which remains based on models, not empirical evidence, then we’ll get nowhere. And that’s why I feel, and many other scientists feel, an open debate is what we need to have. Complex computer models and algorithms have been used to create global warming predictions. Prof. Clark is critical of the accuracy of many of the predictions, and suspicious of the lack of transparency regarding algorithms, that have led to famous findings. In particular the hockey stick graph credited to Michael Mann. So the hockey stick became the poster child of Environment Canada and many other global warming reports and institutions. And the hockey stick is basically an evaluation of temperature over the past thousand years and it basically showed a relatively flat period of temperatures for the past thousand years up to about a 100 years ago and then a rapid upshoot. So, it looks exactly like a hockey stick. Michael Mann and his colleagues would not release their algorithm. You would think that a document like this, with such impact on economic consequences, because of the global warming mantra ... you'd think that they would want to release this to Congress and they wouldn’t. Michael Mann would also not respond to our request for an interview. What else have you guys been up to this week? We've been following the science discussions with the IPCC stuff. It's … it’s frustrating, but it’s also interesting … it can be fun because it gets a little bit heated, with Saudi Arabia being very difficult the way that they are, … based … This morning they were saying that the scientific knowledge about climate change is only starting to emerge. Terrible … wow … yeah … and that we need more information on the climate change before we can start to act. So we’ll continue to … to talk back and forth. I wrote a book about the role of ocean ... oceanic fluctuations, of oceanic oscillations and the role of the sun. Then I was asked from the IPCC, by the IPCC to … to assist them and I made comments and I saw that it was a shaky ground where they … on which that they build their prophecies. From 2000 to 2010, it was not warming as they thought. You should think that they discuss this in the summary for policymakers … and they decided to sort it out. Not irritating the public, of things which are not in line with their models … So I said OK, then I will do it on my own with colleagues. And so we did scientific work, and we published in peer reviewed journals. And what he could show, is that the medieval warm period from 950 to 1250 was as warm as today. The IPCC said: yes, it is only in northern Europe. So what we did is we investigated South America. We investigated Africa, Antarctica, Oceania … and could show in all continents, of the Earth, it was as warm as today, 1000 years ago. And the question is: how could that come? There was no CO2 issue. So is Mother Nature really able to do that on her own? And if you go further to the Roman period, you have the same thing. Every thousand years you have a warm period. And if you look at the, at the images at the pictures of the IPCC you see it is flat. The medieval warm period is not there, the little ice age is not there. It’s like a hockey stick. They changed the past … to influence the future. I’m sure that CO2 is changing climate. It is influencing … that's true. But what we have to discuss is: Do we really think that natural forces are zero since 1820? Are zero after the little Ice Age? Mother Nature has stopped anything of the changing, what she has done thousands and other thousands of years? So yes, there is a CO2 issue: 50%, maybe 60, maybe 40, I don’t know nobody knows. But the good message I have to .. to .. can .. can tell is: we have more time than three periods of legislation. We have three, three generations to settle this. Yeah, I can send an article in one of the journals and, but … And if I have a one on one with my colleagues from the political party, they say “OK yeah, maybe you are right, but if I go into the Congress … they would laugh at me.” So, there is a very strong … media supported mainstream. The mainstream is very strong. I think 99% of the young people are educated in that direction: CO2 is a bad bad molecule … And it’s wrong! And it is responsible for all evil… What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now! On September 27th 2019, millions of students around the world walked out of classes to participate in a global climate strike. My home town was no exception. No more discussions, no more delays. We can no longer allow the fossil fuel companies to manipulate governmental policies and destroy our future! It’s time to move on! So let’s get out there and make our voices heard! What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now! ……. We've got hysteria … embedded, ingrained in our, in our youngest generation, where we parade 8 and 10 year olds before the UN commissions, and have them express their fears and demanding action to save their future. And they don’t have a clue what they’re talking about ‘cause all they know is what their high school teacher or primary school teacher taught them … And all they’re teaching them is what they hear on CBC. They're not reading the documents, they're not reading the science. And so, there's a huge disconnect. And this is very troubling … Let’s just talk about fossil fuels every single chance we can. Because the absence of conversation about fossil fuels in this space is totally bizarre. One of the delegates Laura was talking to me this morning, and she’s like: why are we accounting for upstream emissions? We’ve been here for a week, in like we, we already kind of have our heads wrapped around the talking points. And like, oil and gas isn’t in our talking, but I, I also noticed this, I did an interview with the CDC last week, and I, I didn’t freaking mention fossil fuels. Why didn’t I do that? It’s really important that youth are at the table in decisions around climate change … because we are the ones who are inheriting the, the future that … that our parents have built for us … So we're the ones who disproportionately are going to be feeling the impacts of climate change, and yet, we haven't been the ones who've caused it … So, it's important for us to stand up and ... and demand justice from our leaders on this issue that ... that is going to affect us and our children. We're going to start with IPCC, and then we’ll move to the meat of negotiations, maybe like finance loss and damage, and then overall ambition, which can I think include a conversation around response measures. Great. Thanks guys. The public is informed, that we are heading for a catastrophe in the next 10 years. Everything which is happening in the world is now related to climate and to CO2. If it is: the forest is burning, Mr. Trudeau says: OK, that’s climate change. No! It's not the warming which makes forest- burning. It's the dryness ... it's the draft … It has nothing to do with temperature. Those journalists, those media, those scientists, those politicians who exaggerate the things … are … who are the loudest, I recognize best. We are just in front of the Canadian delegation office, and we are waiting to head in, to speak to the Canadian negotiators, including the head of delegation, Catherine Stewart, about how the negotiations are going this week and also push for some strong leadership from Canada in defending climate science. It’s also a real privilege to get to speak to the head of delegation Catherine Stewart. She’s got a very busy agenda and so carving out time to chat with her is really critical … and she’s of course the person who’s kind of driving the Canadian agenda in these kinds of meetings so, yeah …. so really great … First of all you have to see: the IPCC is a U.N. body, and is not a scientific body. Those who are deciding what is in the summary for policymakers, they are delegates from the states. It's not a scientific issue then, (any)more: it is a political issue. If we reduce CO2 and reduce oil consumption, the price will fall globally by that, and others are stepping in … Because then they can use more of the oil reserves, it’s very easy. So if the others say … if two thirds of the, of the globe said: It’s your task, Canada, Europe. You have to do this, we not. And you did, you're reducing it, It's better for them. They get the cheaper oil and the coal. Fine for them. Therefore, this is not a good contract for the world. So thanks so much for meeting with us Catherine and Eli. I wanted to start our conversation with an observation that we’re once again kind of seeing some pushback … against receiving the science around global warming, particularly the latest report from global scientists … and we know that Canada is a huge supporter of science and, of course, of that 1.5 degree target. So we would love to hear your guy’s take on that. Thanks and I think that’s an excellent net to start our meeting off on. Because you know, we see these reports, it’s absolutely critical… I mean why are we here, right? The Science is clear. And a, and we want to be able to advance and give these things the profile that, that we feel they need to have, in order to spur climate action, right? I mean, there’s there’s a great urgency. The IPCC report, you know, underlined it for us last, last fall in the lead up to COP24. And I think it, it helped parties to come together and give us the rule book … that we’re able to, to get. So the science is the underpinning of everything and we have Canadian scientists involved as well in helping to produce those reports and the peer review. So I, I think it’s a very critical part for us. And we’re going to continue to be advocating for the welcoming, and the recognition of these reports, and their value to, to what they bring to our discussions here. So we're going to keep … we're going to keep working on that with, with countries that also feel the same way as us. And that's something that we’re not going to let go of … easily. Good to hear, so we can count on you to join other countries in advocating really strongly for science of climate change to be accepted and add space. Yeah, good to hear. Thanks, Good! The next step is, to kill coal, gas and oil. Reliability of the power will suffer. Blackouts will be more. Prices … exploding. That means at the end, losing industry. And deindustrialization will come. Normally people would not accept that, because it is their labor, their work, their income. But if you can tell them: if you do don’t do that, Armageddon is waiting for you, the hell is waiting for you; and you believe in that, you’re acting against your own interests. We have to negotiate, but then all players, and the real players have to be at the table. And nobody should go outside and play their own cup. And therefore it is silly to think, if we run forward, if Canada runs forward, Germany ahead, the others will not follow. They will not. Canada should be looking at Venezuela very carefully, because, in a way Canada is in a similar position. Canada is a very wealthy country today. And Venezuela was that way, back in the 50s and 60s, the wealthiest country in Latin America on a per capita basis by far. And it was all based on oil and gas. Their wealth was totally based on that, and what’s happened? And Canada is, I think in a similar position in many respects. That Canada is a very, very prosperous country, but it’s very dependent on oil and gas. John Perkins is a New York Times bestselling author, with first hand experience in global economic imperialism. The oil and gas issue is a, a really fascinating one at this point in history, because here we have this resource, that our economic development in the United States and basically every other country is built upon. That’s the foundation. And many countries’ economies depend on those resources of oil and gas. Venezuela’s a great example, Canada’s certainly an example. So here we are at this point in time, where there are alternatives, which, in some respects look like they’re better alternatives, but from an environmental standpoint: solar, wind and who knows what’s next to come … But at the same time, there's this huge resource that's buried beneath the earth, in so many parts of the world, that so many people depend on to ensure their economic growth. We in this province, are very educated about energy, the role it plays in our lives The growth in energy demand is not only here, but around the world. But it seems like the there’s a bit of a fantasy taking place in the rest of the country, where nobody is winning themselves off fossil fuels. We’ve got not just American environmental foundations and environmental groups campaigning against us. We’ve got Canadian environmental groups campaigning against us …. partnering with First Nations leaders, who are campaigning against us. Partnered with politicians who continue to give misinformation, to campaign against us, and so we feel like there’s this big disconnect. That, we understand where our energy comes from. We understand how to produce. We understand some of the environmental tradeoffs. We understand that you can produce it in a way, that has less and less impact on the environment. But the conversation that seems to be taking place in the rest of the country, is a completely different one. If it doesn’t get resolved, I don’t know that the country can survive. And I wanted the same thing. It’s clear to me that the future of Calgary, and the very sovereignty of Canada is at risk due to climate change. And most of the reasons have nothing to do with temperature. The climate change debate is fiercely polarizing. But to love our country, our current way of life, and our planet all at the same time can be done. I think it will take a new conversation. The world’s population and demand for fossil fuels is only increasing, and Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world. We are in a unique position to not only supply our own needs, but to be a global leader, in demonstrating how to decrease emissions, protect the impact on the environment, create a healthy and sustainable mix of various energy sources, imbed new technologies, and create lasting relationships, and partnerships with indigenous communities. We can show the world how it's supposed to be done. Instead of being scared that the world is going to end in 12 years, we should be excited about the possibilities of a new world, that Canadians can help create, by harnessing what we have. We can have a significant voice in the climate change debate, but it’s a voice that doesn’t fit easily within the two camps. There is a middle way, a third approach that doesn’t get the headlines, and I found it through rethinking my own biases and challenging my own perspectives, and through listening. Hi, Catherine, Hi … Ian Clark … I’m so pleased you’re here ‘cause I’ve wanted to talk about the … the current state of the climate debate. Yeah … and I mentioned that I’m an environmentalist, I teach a course, quaternary geology and climate change, which I’ve been teaching for 30 years. And when I first took it over it was just quaternary geology. But this is in 1988 … right … and just then, the debate was started … Yeah, yeah, that’s when the IPCC got rolling … That’s right, and I got involved and I was teaching students about CO2 as this potent greenhouse gas and a … but I’ll tell you quite frankly, since that time I’ve been studying the carbon cycle. I've been looking at it from a scientific perspective ... It’s less obvious that CO2 is driving climate. When I look at environmental degradation and all the rest. My question is what’s driving that, and it seems to be other items than that which we're fighting. And so, that’s why I’m very interested to talk with you about the IPCC’s perspective and their understanding of the science. I mean, I think it’s probably important to note that it’s not necessarily about the IPCC’s understanding of science. It’s about the scientists who are inputting into the IPCC reports … So you’re absolutely right, and that’s why I dig down on the science documents … It’s pretty obvious that there are a lot of ways in which people have lived on this planet, for quite a long time that are becoming untenable, because of the warming we’re experiencing … I’m going to call you on that. That I don’t see. When I look at extreme weather events, drilling down again on the IPCC scientists reports, they don’t suggest hurricane activity is stronger. They don't even mention wildfires, although we continually hear wildfires as a climate driven phenomenon. So we can't connect all that stuff with warming. Well, we can't connect the occurrence of those natural phenomenon you're absolutely right. So fires, floods, sea level rise, erosion. But climate change is responsible for them becoming far more extreme. So it has this amplification effect. Those, … that amplification isn’t discussed in the IPCC documents. I don’t see this in the literature, and I hear it on CBC, and I hear some people talking on the radio, but I don’t see it backed up by science. It is not … everything I have seen about that contradicts you … No, absolutely not. I’ve got the data and I can show it to you. The climate disasters have been going on since biblical times. We can attribute a lot of that to warming, if you want to: 75% natural. So what are we going to do about that? What are we going to say about the occurrence of these events if it’s all natural? We can’t change it with CO2 … You're fixating on this 75% of it is natural … … It’s not in the IPCC documents … But, I just don’t understand like why that means we shouldn’t do anything about it, when there’s 25% of it that you’re saying we have control over like… I don’t believe we have done the other 25% … that’s the models. And the models are running hot but these are… I guess I just like … even if I disagree with a person on the extent to which humans have the ability to affect a change in climate. From my perspective it’s an issue of risk management. So if you agree that there’s even a 50% likelihood that we are responsible for a changing climate, is it not worth our while to figure out how we can mitigate that impact to the greatest extent possible? All the while creating a better way of living on the planet? I mean it just doesn’t make any sense to me, that we would avoid taking action that we, that we would let ourselves off the hook, even if there’s only a 25% of that problem that we’re responsible for. I mean, I am going to take responsibility for that 25% then. That’s what I’m going to do. The environmental industry is a billion dol… more than a billion dollar a day industry, and 95% of that is towards climate science and mitigation. What about some of the pressing environmental issues, that really could be addressed if we didn't have this focus on something we really can’t change? Fortunately, a lot of climate solutions actually entail bringing human society into a better balance with the natural world, and can have knock-on effects that help us address many other environmental ills. So my question is, well, if one doesn’t agree, that that’s the number one reason to switch to renewable energy. Why not agree that, you know, making sure kids grow up without asthma is a really good reason? I, … I think fighting pollution is a prime objective that should be a prime element of any environmental policy with our governments … Absolutely! I’m just a little concerned about our reliance on renewables for big energy, if, … if we’re going to do that, we’re going to compromise our economic strength, and then we’ll be overtaken by other major countries that that don't embrace renewa … This is not me saying that we need to kill an industry tomorrow. But I do think that we need to do some creative thinking … about, how we plan for a future where we are creating prosperity and generating jobs sustainably, for a long period of time. I certainly agree with you on that. I think we come at this from the same heart, in the same … same emotion, that we want what’s better for the planet, for humanity. My fear, and my concern… really is just that we’re focusing on one thing which is climate which … I’m a scientist, I’ve been looking at this for 30 years … and I know we will do nothing about climate, we will not have an impact on climate. I don’t think we’re going to get out of the fossil fuel game anytime soon. I think it’s going to be part of the mix, 2040, 2050, just like it is now. I think we have to be honest about that. And further, I think we have to put a lot of environmental goodwill into fixing the problems we can fix! Scientific, science, oh that that’s a big word, scientific. Scientific to me, is only … a farce. A farce and, … a theory. Science is only … is a theory. It's not … it's not a fact. Can you see the child? The child’s on top. There’s a straight line … straight down. See that rock there? Below, there is the chief. See the face of the chief? The mouth, the eyes and the eyebrow? And look up higher. You see the face of a child, and it’s a girl. That means, each time you come by here always reminds you who you are, and your … Whatever you do in life … you got to think about that child, your children ahead of you. That’s what you got to think about, anything you do, your actions. Anything, before you decide anything. Think about this child that you’re going to leave behind. It’s written in rock, not on paper. It’s on rock! Who you’re supposed to be! Who you are!
