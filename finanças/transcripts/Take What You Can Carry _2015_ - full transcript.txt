(funky music) (acoustic guitar music) (singing) - Hey. - Hi. - So you had fun last night? - It was okay. How 'bout you? - Yeah cool. (sink running) You come and go as you please. - [Lily] What do you mean? - Nothing. I'm happy when you're here. - [Lily] I'm happy when I'm here too. - [Man] You know I think about leaving with you sometimes. - You do? I thought you liked things the way they were. - I dunno. (acoustic guitar music) (singing quietly) (phone vibrating) (speaking foreign language) (siren wailing) (door shuts) - Finally at the end of June and now only nine more days before I move into the new apartment at Stadium Place with my new address. Then I can renew my subscription for the Washington Post which I really enjoyed each morning and had to discontinue when I left Aberdeen. I met a few of my new neighbors who are just as I am eager to get on with the move for my assigned moving day I will be... It will be July 9th, 1 PM to 4 PM. Mark will move my stuff from Aberdeen. Then we will gradually remove these 19 shopping bags of clothing, medications, personal hygiene, writing papers, and important, to me, documents in the following days to 302 Stadium Place. After this long stay here at Stella's. In the meantime of nine days I'll try to continue to convince my very worried and concerned daughter that I am eating everything she gets me to keep my strength up. Lily, I think of you visiting around Berlin on your bicycle and of course this means many prayers for your health and safety each night. Always, your loving mama. - We speak languages. We can speak three different languages. We can express pain in three different languages. We don't need languages to express pain. We feel a lot of pain. We find it very hard to cry but when we do we let it run. We don't like Christmas. We have a problem with religion. We are baptized. We don't believe in Jesus but we decorate the Christmas tree. We are an atheist. We are unique. Yeah. (laughs) No you are! We were once in a local newspaper and got very proud of it. (laughs) - No. - No? - You were? - No. (laughs) We are homesick. - No. Uh-- - Yeah? - Yeah. - We think, uh, we lost someone in our family. - Yes. - We have been rushed to hospital in an ambulance. - No. - No? So that's a solo. (breathing and vocalizing) - Yeah. - That's great, and then. - Yeah. - Have a look. More sort of freestyle. - Instead of I'm not being the third person who's in the lead. You're supposed to like throw your glance around. (laughing) (murmuring) - We think too much. (violin music) - We drink too much. - We masturbate too much. (frenetic electronic music) - We have stalked people on the internet. (bright electronic music) - We once slept with someone only because the person was famous. (light music) * Through a mask whenever she saw him * * Carried away by a moon white shadow * * He passed on worried and warning * * Carried away by a moon white shadow * * Lost in a rhythm on Saturday night * * Far away on the other side * He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight * * And she couldn't find how to push through * * But the trees whispered to me * * Carried away by a moon white shadow * * Singing a song solemn and freeing * * Carried away by a moon white shadow * - We don't understand the conflict in the Iraq. * He was shot six times by a man on the ground * * And she couldn't find how to push through * * I stay * I pray * See you in heaven far away * I stay * I pray * See you in heaven one day * 4 AM in the morning * Carried away by a moonlight shadow * * I watched your vision forming * * Carried away by a moon white shadow * * Star walk slide in the silvery night * * Far away on the other side - We have never seen a dead body. (singing in foreign language) - We don't care what happens to our body when we die. (frenetic music) - Did she eat anything? - [Lily] Oh yeah we got a little pretzel thing. - Okay, fine. (giggles) (baby cries out) You can, we need them. - Oh. - Yeah, yeah. We have to take them. And this is wet? - Yeah a little bit. - So maybe we can just... We can just put it here. Thank you. (baby cries) (shushes) Could you, this one is dry so maybe I can take it? - Yeah. (baby cries out) (laughing) - Does it work? (baby babbling) So maybe you can check whether I'm gonna need a new towel. - Okay. - Just pack her things. - Okay. (baby babbling) - Come here, come here, come here, come here. Oh. (baby babbling) (laughs) - Hey Melena. - Hi. - Do you want to bring Musha? (speaking foreign language) (baby crying) (laughing) - [Lily] Really? (speaking foreign language) - Lily, Lily maybe you can take her. - [Lily] Oh sure. - Thank you. Bye my dear. Okay Lily are there anything that you have to know for the weekend? - Um... - Um... I gave you already the key? - Yeah, thank you. - Um... Yeah also I have a key for the letterbox. - Oh yeah sure. - Yes maybe you can empty it. - Mm hmm. - And you can cook for sure? - Yeah. - Whatever you want, yeah, sure. - Thank you. - I'll take some things with me but, but yeah, the most things will stay here. Okay. The machines you know how they work, it's quite easy. - Oh yeah. - [Woman] The dishwasher and also the washing machine if you need it, just use it. - Oh, okay, thanks. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. (speaking foreign language) - Hello, come here. So, whoops. - Hey. - Hi! - How are you doing? - Good, how are you? - Yeah really good. You're staying here for the weekend? - Yeah, yeah. - Nice. - Thank you for... - Yeah, I'm for the weekend also. - Yeah, I'll be... - We could do something. - Melena, hey. - I'll be here for awhile. - Nice. - Yeah. - Yeah okay, I will call you. - Nico. (speaking foreign language) - You got your shoes? Oh, Melena you want that? - Okay take care. - Thank you. - Take care and have fun. - Thank you so much for everything. - Ciao, ciao, ciao! (laughs) Ciao. - Bye! (brushing teeth) (spitting) (gargling) (piano music) I think of you often. I am writing from (murmuring under breath). I am writing from Khomeini's garden. You would love it. It's wild like our garden back home. The weather is soft and sunny, there are bees everywhere. I found an apartment that suits me. It's bright with windows overlooking the courtyard. The sun wakes me early each morning but I don't mind because I've been going to bed early and taking lots of naps like you told me to. My favorite thing about the building is the staircases. We should live more on staircases. I'm happy to hear you're moving into your new apartment soon. Sorry not there to help. I love moving into new places. So much better than leaving and seeing all you've left behind is dust. Remember that train trip we took across the country? And spent three whole days just looking out the window. Constantly moving even though we were perfectly still. (dogs barking) (babies babbling)
