Take a break. Darwin, fix the central light. Very good, people, but I need more strength, more passion and more dynamism. Rest for now. Dieguito, how did the photos come out? Fine. I will call you when I have them. When is the opening? Friday. What did you think? To be honest? Very cool! Fuck, you scared me! I thought you had not liked it! I will be performing at the Sixty Nine this week. Really? I thought you were over with Transvestite Shows. I was. Years ago when I got the operation but I have debts and I haven't paid the dancers yet. - Are you coming? - When have I ever failed you? Great! Tell Perla Marina and Fabrizio. - Hello? - What's up, kid? I am good. How about you? Good. Just finished a delivery. Are you done already? Five minutes ago. Dinner at La Barraca? Damn'. La Barraca? - What are we celebrating? - I have a surprise for you. Watch it, Fabrizio! Last time you had a surprise we ended up in Choroni beach. Are you ready to order or are you waiting for someone else? The person that I was expecting has already arrived and I am looking at him right now. Excuse me, are you looking at me? Who else? Come one, grab a sit and stop fooling around. So much traffic, pal! I thought I was never going to arrive! Don't worry. Thank you. How was Delirio's presentation? Great! How about you? I did not know you had a delivery today. Patient delivered earlier than expected. Shall we order the same as last time? Yes. We are ready to order. Yes sir, I'll get to you in a moment. So, what is the surprise? More than a surprise, it is a proposition. You want to sell pine trees for Christmas? No. A patient gifted me this pine tree. She found out my birth date and told me that, according to Celtic astrology, my tree is the pine tree. Wow! So? Nothing. I just thought we could go to M?rida and plant it there. Fabrizio, please don't tell me you want to reforest the planet now, pal. I can't have a serious conversation with you. Cheers! What is up with her? I don't know, but she's been staring at me since I arrived. Could it be that she thinks you are hitting on her husband? What would the gentleman like to order? Diego, it's Valentina. I need to talk to you urgently. Please call me. Should I leave it here? The pine tree I mean. Yes, that's fine. You are taking it home with you thought, right? No, I better leave it here until we go to M?rida. Come on, Fabrizio, you know I am a mess. Plants die on me all the time. Don't worry, I will take care of it. What are you going to do tomorrow? I have a photo-shoot here, with a model. Why don't you come live with me and just use this apartment as a studio? What? No, pal. Your dad could get a heart attack. Besides, I'm not much of a commitment person. What if it doesn't work? What if it does? Think about it. When you agree to it, we will take the pine tree and plant it together. Very good, Paula. Done, change your clothes. Elvys! Help me with the buttons please. Magnificent! Thank you. Let's go. - About time. - Diego, it was horrible! The bus crashed and I had to grab a cab. Are you sure you didn't oversleep after partying last night? No, don't be like that, I'm telling you the taxi crashed. The taxi or the bus? What about that? I know, while you were waiting for the other cab, you got mugged. I still don't understand why you are still with that guy. Ivan always tells me he is going to change and I don't know how to leave him. Leaving him! Just leaving him! Now, get to work. Should I make coffee? No. There is coffee in the kitchen. Ask Elvys and Paula if they want some. How awful! That girl is on the bone. Paula is... I'm ready, Diego. Gorgeous, Paula, beautiful! Perla Marina, how are you? Don't even ask. Hi, Elvys, how are you? Wonderful! I can see that. Do you want coffee? Yes, thank you. No sugar I guess. Yes, no sugar. - I want some as well. - With sugar of course. - How did you know? - I'm psychic. Come with me. Do you have something to cover this? What happened to you? It was horrible! I got mugged! Does it hurt? Eat, Paquito. Thank you, son. Patricia, you look fatter. It can't be, mister Paco! I have been on a diet; I am thinner now, right? Well, it does not look like it, what do you want me to say? - Dad, come on! - But it is the truth! Enough Paco! Don't listen to your father-in-law, you know he's a monster. Damn! Your mother complains from the moment she gets up until the moment she goes to sleep! And you can't stop talking even when you are asleep! I'm stressed out, Paco! Can we eat without arguing? Talking about stress. Dieguito, why do you always have your cellphone turned off? Mom, you know that I tum it off when I'm working. Valentina has been calling you from Madrid so desperately that I could not even ask how the kid is doing. She needs to talk to you and she can't reach you. You have to grow up! You are no longer a little kid, damn it! Dad, don't start! I'm serious, Diego, call Valentina. I'm worried sick. Call her. I'll call her later mom! Shit, it's Estrellita's show. Come on, turn the volume up. Dad, are you going to watch that now? I love this show! I think it's fabulous! - I think this show is garbage. - How can you say that? That lady is a very serious professional. Would you shut it, damn it? Recently, some countries have approved a law that allows marriage between people of the same sex. On today's show "Gay and Lesbian Marriage, is it the end of the world?" Let's receive our first guest. Grandpa, what is "gay"? - What is "gay"? - A faggot! Don't teach the kid bad words, Paco! And "lesbian"? A trucker whore. Paco! Damn, if he asks me I have to answer! Kelvin, do you have a couple? Yes, for seven years. Man or woman? Man. So tell me. Do you think it is normal for two men or two women to get married? Yes, why wouldn't I have the right to marry whomever I wanted to, like everyone else? A real marriage is what your mother and I have. Not this modern nonsense. Dad, you are being a bit conservative for someone who claims to be a liberal. I would rather my son to be a thief than a faggot! Patricia! Don't be silly! The church is totally against these types of union. Let's receive Father Jacinto Y?pez. A priest now? This is the last straw! What do they know about marriages? Paco! Please! Good afternoon, Father. Good afternoon, Estrellita. Does the catholic church agree with homosexual marriages? No, not at all. This is the result of depravity, debauchery and degradation that society is undergoing today. Father, are you saying that our guest is a pervert and a libertine? No doubt that he needs spiritual help. This priest is an asshole! That's enough! It's over! Let's finish eating in peace! Diego, that friend of yours, the medic, what's his name? Fabrizio. - How is he? - Well. It's very odd that he is still not married at his age, don't you agree? He is getting married. Really? With whom? With me. Uncle, are you a faggot? Here's dessert! Anyone wants some? Diego... Not much, busy with the premier. I need the photos. I will go by your place tomorrow to pick them up. Kisses. - Hello? - Diego... It is Valentina. I was going to call you now. I've been calling you these past few days and you haven't answered me. I can't talk much now. Look, next week I'm going to London for my master's degree. - That's great. - No, it's not great. Everything got complicated and I can't take Armando with me, so you have to take care of him. What? How can that be? Can't he stay with someone in Madrid? Diego, you are his father. You are no longer the 15-year-old brat who got a classmate pregnant. But, Valentina, the kid is used to living there. Besides, this country is messed up. Well, he's going to have to get used to that "mess" because there's no other way. I don't have time for anything, especially for raising up a child. Diego, please. This is an amazing opportunity for me. Besides, Armandito could use spending some time with you. Give me a second. Tell those Chinese people to wait a second, damn it. They are not Chinese, they are Japanese. Same shit. What do they want? Diego, I have to go. I can't keep talking. Listen to me... your mother already knows, but I'm hoping it is you who picks him up at the airport. Armando is already on the plane and he arrives at Maiquetia at 7 AM. What? What? Do the passengers from Madrid come out through here? From Madrid, from Mexico, from Colombia, from everywhere. Everyone comes out through here. The ones from Madrid already came out. Armandito? Armando, I'm no longer a kid. You've grown a lot, pal! How are you? Dad! Leave it, I can do it. I also use this living room as a photo-shoot set. Here's the kitchen and behind there is the laboratory, where I reveal the photos. This place has a special light for photos. You have no idea how helpful it is. At the end there is my room, this will be your room and also the guest's bathroom. It's a little small, so we can share mine if you'd like. I rather use the guest's bathroom. I took that photo of you in Madrid four years ago. Five. You haven't taken any other photos because I never look good in them. Then I'm going to take you some cool ones. I don't want any photos, OK? OK. He looks like he is upset all the time. But that is because he's shy. Put him on the phone. He's taking a shower. Tell him I'll call him later. Make sure that he eats, please. If it were for of him, he'd never eat. He's always on a diet. Yes, Valentina. I'm making him pasta right now. You? Cooking? I have to go. The bell is ringing. Dude, I tried everything to get a hold of you yesterday. I was out all afternoon and I ran out of battery. Here are the photographs. - What's wrong? - Nothing, it's just... You are coming to see me perform at the Sixty Nine tonight! You promised. I'm sorry; I didn't know you had company. He is my son, Armando. This is Delirio, a friend. Yes. Well, my real name is Alejandra. Delirio is just my stage name. Delirio Del Rio. Like Dolores but Delirio. Of course, before I started calling myself Alejandra I was called Aleio, but then I got my operation and changed my name. So what it is then? Delirio, Alejandra or Aleio? Delirio. I used to be a male dancer, but then I wanted to be a female dancer, and while I was doing the change I was neither one nor the other, so people called me Delirio and it stuck that way. Now I'm a choreographer because I'm too tall to be a female dancer. It's a long story. Too long if you ask me. And what's your name? Me? Armando Martinez... and that's it. Martinez just like Diego. Of course! What I fool I am! Armando, get dressed. We're going to eat. I'm not hungry. Did you have to tell all that paraphernalia to the kid? It smells like burnt tomatoes. Fuck! The spaghettis! Hello? Mom? I'm home with Armandito. We're coming over. Pal, these are the house keys. They're for you. Tonight, after grandpa takes you home, call me at my cellphone, to know you arrived home safely. I have a commitment and I think I will come home a bit late. I don't mind how late you arrive. You are old enough now. And don't call me "pal", I'm not your pal, I'm your son, remember? Grandma! Armandito! You're already taller than your father! How gorgeous! You're already a man! Give me a hug, damn it! It's understandable that he's upset. You haven't heard him yet. It's like he's from over there, like he's another kid. Talk to him. It's about time you have that conversation you've been avoiding. It's your time as well. Thank God! Everything is easier when they are younger. Let's see. - Ready? - Yes. I know that commitment stuff doesn't suit you, but when it comes to a son, you have no choice. Talk to your son. Don't be afraid of him. Look, this is my third baby already. When there is love, there are no differences that can't be solved. Talk to him! - Thanks. - No problem. Doctor, I've been thinking about what you told me. About M?rida. - Have you? - Yes. No, I'll tell you tonight. - Finally! - The bathroom line was long. I think that guy over there likes me. He's so hot! - Crist6bal! How are you doing? - I'm fine. How about you? - Fine. - And Fabrizio? He should be arriving soon. - Well, see you later. - Sure. That's a shame! If you think you are going to find your soulmate here, you are wasting your time. Besides, don't you have a boyfriend? Ivan? We're over! And this time for good. Yeah, sure. What's up? DEATH TO ALL FAGGOTS - Hello? Hello? - What's wrong? It's Fabrizio, but I can't hear anything. Wait, I'm going out. Leave him already! You are going to kill him! Hello? Fabrizio? Hello, this is Fabrizio Di Giaccomo... Fuck! Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. I'm going to be here with you. Don't fall asleep. Go, C?sar, go! You can't come in. Wait here. C?sar. Diego, we managed to stabilize him, but I'm worried about the inner lesions he has due to the beating he took. Can I see him? Not right now. He is in intensive care, unconscious and with assisted breathing. Don't worry. Did you call his family? Yes, I called them. I'm going to be with him the whole time, don't worry. If you need anything, just call me. - Where is he? - He is in intensive care. What happened? I don't know. I found him unconscious next to his car. Where the hell were you at? - Diego! What happened? - Where's Fabrizio? The more I think about it, the less I understand why someone did this to him. The important thing now is that Fabrizio pulls through this. - Did you see him already? - Yes. He's still unconscious. I'm going to see him. I'm sorry Diego, my husband doesn't want anyone to see him. - Just us two. - What? How? I don't want you or the perverts you hang out with to see him. I don't hang out with perverts and I'm going to see him whether you like it or not. You and my son are nothing. What happened to him is your fault. Please, don't argue here. Fabrizio and I are a couple. As soon as he gets out of here we are going to live together. I'd rather see him dead. You are the same as the sons of bitches that did this to Fabrizio. Man, you are never home. Is it always like this or just because I'm here? No, I'm sorry, the truth is that... It's fine. I'm used to it. Are you hungry? No, I already had a bite to eat. How are you? What have you done today? Nothing. Well, yes. I've done something. I've been trying to find out what is so important that has kept you so busy during these five years. Turn that off! Are you embarrassed that I know you are a faggot? - Turn that off! - Because you are a faggot, right? Listen to me, kid! Yes, I'm gay, but I'm also your dad, and I've shown myself to you exactly as I am without hiding anything! I don't care what you do with your life! I don't care! Did you know? I do care, because I love you and because I'm afraid, damn it. Afraid that you won't understand. What do I have to understand, dad? That you don't care about me? Five years! And you have only fucking called me a couple of times! Now I'm here and, what have you done? Leaving me here like a dog and shove in my face that you like guys. Why did you let us leave? Was it because of that? No, listen to me. Your mom wanted to leave because she had better chances there. I thought it was a good idea because you'd have a better future. And you do. You have a better future. I've been looking for mine, but it's like the pictures. What you think it's going to come out, sometimes don't come out as expected and it's not my fault. What about me? How is it my fault, dad? Did you never realize your son missed you and needed you, damn it? That's it, Tony. Smile, that's it. Now the other side. That's it, Tony. Smile. Now the other side. Perfect. Now I'm "bad", give me a "bad" face. Done, change. Dana, your turn. Like that, very good. Hands on your waist. Good. Hands on your waist. Done. Rest. Armando, can you get the door? It can't be! You are Armandito! - Armando. - I'm Perla Marina. - Perla what? - Perla Marina. - Stage name? - No. Why? Sounds like a soap opera. Well, with my life's story you could do a broadway musical. Give me a hug. You are gorgeous! Just like your dad! By the way, it's good that you are here for him. What happened to his partner was horrible, a disgrace, a tragedy. I have to work! - Good morning! - Well, good afternoon. - Dieguito, it was horrible! - I don't want to hear it. I know his father doesn't want to, but I need to tell him something. He's not going to listen to you. I don't care, give me five minutes. - I'm sorry. I can't. - You know I'm going in either way. Shit, Diego, you're going to get me in trouble. Damn it, C?sar. Don't fuck with me, pal. If Fabrizio was conscious, what would he say? How is everything? You must be bored here. Don't worry, everything is going to be alright. That haircut looks nice. Fuck, I miss you. Things with Armando... the same. I know I messed up, but I'd love for him to love me back again. We used to enjoy our time together. Well, I have to go now. I just wanted to tell you that I want to go to M?rida, so get up before I get cold feet. I'm kidding, pal! For you I will wait as long as necessary. I brought you this so that you don't forget it. I was going to give it to you that night but you never arrived. We are taking some declarations from young men with the description you gave us. It's him. That's the guy. Son of a bitch! Let me go! Let me go! - Mr. Martinez! Please! -It's him! It's him! DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT STUDENT HOUSING IN SPAIN? HELLO. HELLO, ARE YOU FROM SPAIN? NO, BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE. HOW OLD ARE YOU? L JUST WANT TO CHAT WITH SOMEONE WHO IS NOT JUST INTO SEX. That's me. 16, YOU? 15, WELL, 16 NEXT MONTH. AND WHAT DO YOU DO? STU DYING, HIGH SCHOOL. L STUDY MUSIC. Music is the best language there is. WHY DON'T WE CONTINUE OVER THE VIDEO CHAT? VVAIT A SECOND. OK. Hello. Do you have a camera? IT'S NOT WORKING. That's a shame. Do you like music? Yes. And do you dance? MORE OR LESS. Good. Can you dance tango? Of course. Really? I love tango. WAIT A SECOND, DON'T GO. OK. Yes? Armando, are you there? Yes, he's here. I'm going to put him on, OK? My mom. Hello? Valentina? Wait a second. I brought pizza. OK. Yes, tell me. When are you going to London? HERE I AM. Hello. You are very cute. Thanks. Where's your partner, dad? I can tell. He's in the hospital, in a comma. Some guys beat him up. Why? I don't know. Maybe they hate everything that reminds them what they are. Dad, since when do you like guys? Since I can remember. Your grandparents say we are very much alike. I don't see the resemblance, do you? What do you think? Armando, help me with this. Out of these two, which one do you like the most? This one or this one? That one. OK, and between these two? That one. That's weird. Then, why did you put this one on your profile? Fuck, dad! You are so nosy! Nosy? Who was the one going through my stuff yesterday? Wasn't it you? Maybe your grandparents are right. You and I are more alike than we think. Between her and him, who would you choose? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we are not alike because I like girls. OK, now that we both know what we like, stop playing with your pizza and eat it already. And that ring? I've never seen it before. Take it off. Give it to his father when he comes. "Those who were lucky enough to assist witnessed a stellar hour. "The impeccable interpretive force of the dancers "with choreographic genius, gives the show a bold and vibrant composition." That's it. Is that it? All these months of work for an asshole to write five lines that not even his mother understands. I'm definitely going to close my dance company and find something else to do. I think the critic is good. I don't care. I don't do this so people can write pretty things but to remove people. Like Estrellita Mata. She says interesting things in her show. That witch is able to ridicule people's problems in order to gain rating. I would lead that show a thousand times better than her. Delirio, could you teach Armando some tango steps? Why is that? Dad! Leave me alone! OK? He met a girl on the internet who dances tango. How beautiful! First love! I also fell in love in San Felipe, when I was a little girl... Well, little boy, you understand. I fell in love with Luis Fernando. He was also in love with me, though he wouldn't admit it. One day we kissed and he pushed me aside and told me that we could only have something if I was a woman. Then I came to Caracas because I wanted to be a female dancer. Of course, I was a male dancer at first and then a female dancer. - But since I was so tall... - We all know that story. - What happened to Luis Fernando? - I don't know. I lost track of him. That can't be! Now that it's possible for that love to be made true! What a soap opera! So? Are you going to teach him or not? Dad! I don't want to! Just drop it! You! I'm going to count to three and I'm already on two! Very well! You did it very well! Three, four, five, six... Seven, eight, nine, ten. Backwards! He is still unconscious. What a bunch of scoundrels! That's what they are. Doing that to Fabrizio, that poor boy who helps bring lives to this world. There's no right! - Come on, damn it. Come on! - Let's go Vino Tinto! My love, you know that your father is dumb and he doesn't know how to say it, but he loves you and he's going to back you up through anything, we both are. Goooool! Paco, don't over-excite yourself! You are going to get a heart attack! Since Armandito came it's been a disaster! He feels like a kid when both of them are together. Come on referee; end it already that Estrellita's show is going to start! Paco! Damn! Stop it! My boy does not want to go out with his friends. He doesn't want to go to parties, like any other boy his age. I don't know what to do, Estrellita, I'm desperate. He spends all day in his room in front of the computer playing with his "Pleyesteshon". Boy, wouldn't you like to meet a girl? Have a girlfriend? Honey, you have to step up. Girls don't like me. How are they going to like you if you don't come out of your bunker? On today's show: "I see myself in the mirror and I feel horrible." Jos? Manuel, our guest, says that he doesn't go out because he's ugly. We also have Chony, his desperate mother. Dr. Blanco, what can you tell us? Estrellita, what we have here is a case of Body Dimorphic Disorder. The poor kid is fucked! ...anguished people and with low self-esteem that find themselves isolated and depressed because they don't feel attractive. This is happening often among teenagers nowadays. Honey, but you are gorgeous! Precisely, young people who suffer this disorder possess a wrong perception of their real selves. That's horrible! Like anorexia? In fact, it was treated as anorexia before, but it's being treated as a different pathology over the past few years. Cut the crap. Don't come telling me that I have that disorder because it's not true. Then why do you have that model's photo on your profile? - Don't mess with my stuff! - Answer me! I don't know, bro! So the girl likes me, I guess! Listen to me, I don't know what you think of yourself, but I assure you, you are a very handsome guy, pal. - I'm not your pal! - And I'm not your bro! Why do you hide yourself? You may not be a model, but you have enough looks and intelligence to make any girl like you, so get that crap out of your head. One, two, three, clear! Hello? One month after the death of the medic Fabrizio Di Giaccomo, his alleged murderers were acquitted because the witness's testimony is inconclusive. Let's talk with the defence attorney. Attorney... The prosecution sees no evidence to prosecute my client because the witness... ...did not see the actual event, but assumes that these boys are the ones responsible because they were near the place where he found his... friend. It was them! There has to be a way to prove it! Don't waste your time. You are not going to find anything. We'll see about that! Mr. Martinez, Mr. Martinez! Yes? Wait a moment please. Dad, it's from the agency again. He can't come to the phone at the moment. Yes, I will tell him. Thank you. Dad, these people have been calling you for weeks about the photos. They let go the guys that killed Fabrizio. Dad, these people will end up in jail sooner or later, OK? Just let it go, it's not worth it. Of course it's worth it. The milonga is tomorrow. Are you coming? I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN. That's a shame. I wanted to see you. DEATH TO ALL FAGGOTS Hello? - Perla Marina, it's Armando. - Armando? What's wrong? My father left and I don't know anything about him. Do you? No, I don't know anything. Where is the bar where Delirio performs? It's on Las Palmas street, why? Armando?, Armando? Who the fuck is Armando? Hello, Diego, what do you want? - The usual. - Sure. Do you see this street right here? You just have to walk to the end and there's the bar. Why don't you take me there? No, men, don't you see this is a one-way street? Do you want me to take the long way around? Yes. No, men, no! I'm in a hurry. Besides, it's close. OK, how much is it? Fifty. Bolivares? No, men, it's fifty Euros. What is it, men? You think I'm stupid or what? Gay is what you are! Shitty Spanish! Whisky on the rocks. Give me another one. On me. Sure. Thanks. How are you? Good. I heard about Fabrizio. I'm really sorry. How are the photographs? - Another whisky on the rocks. - Thank you. Cheers. Excuse me; do any of you know where the Sixty Nine is? I'm leaving, pal. Wait. Let me finish my drink and I'll walk you to your car. Look at this guy. He looks so serious and it turns out he's a faggot. Calm down, bro, I haven't said anything. Bro? There are so many gay people in your fucking country, Spanish! Leave it already. - Let me go. - I'm going to beat you up. But first I'm going to destroy your ass, to see if you still like it afterwards. Let me go, damn it! Let me go! Leave him! You son of a bitch! Look at this! The other faggot just arrived! Leave my father alone bastard! Freeze, son of a bitch! This is how I wanted to see you! Why did you do it? Answer me! Why? What's up manly man? Are you scared? Scared? Scared was your husband. He looked like a little girl. Kneel down! Son of a bitch! Kneel here and beg me so that I don't kill you! No, dad! Kneel, damn it! Who's scared now? Fucking faggot! It's over! You, you and you, if I ever see you around here I'm going to kill you one by one. Move it! What didn't you understand? Get out of here, cocksuckers! We'll be seeing each other, transvestite. What's wrong with you? I know guys like you very well. Don't act up. You know that you have very little "man" in you. Now move along if you don't want me to blow off that fry you have between your legs! I'm warning you, I have good accuracy! Get out of here! What are you waiting for? Move! - Ouch! Be careful! - Put up with it, asshole! It's a good thing I did that beauty and facial reconstruction course a while back! Well, I don't see myself very reconstructed. You are a fool! Your dad is immature! And you... a charm. Thank you. Get a room! Now all three of you need to leave for me to change. Don't worry about me. Out the three of you! I'm a lady! - But you lost your charm out there. -Out! He is the law in a blind man's land the one-eyed is the King. And the man thinks that when he looks at you he's doing you a favour. He thinks that way he achieves power. Because no woman can't catch him. He thinks he's the sweetest thing on the world. He thinks he is the last drop of water in the dessert. That being with him is like being in heaven and he is not even a sad man, he's sadly a man. I'm not hungry. Besides, arepas make you fat. How are you going to get fat if you are still growing up? You are going to eat your breakfast! Who could it be? Dieguito, do you think I can stay here for a few days? I feel like we're in a western movie... John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and Frances Fisher. And you? Dr. Quinn. Yes, laugh at me. I'm not going to patch you up again. What happened to you? What else? These morons were fighting the guys that... Don't worry. You already have enough problems. Armando, do you still talk with that girl? What was her name? Laura. We chat every day. - Where does she live? - In M?rida. - M?rida, Spain? - M?rida, Venezuela. There's a M?rida in Spain? How dumb. You should read less gossip magazines and more books. Whatever you say, Dr. Quinn. Laura invited me to a Milonga tonight. What do you do there? Dance tango. What day is it today? Saturday the 25th. Are you giving? To the Milonga? No. Why? I'm not what she thinks. We are going to M?rida. I'M GLAD YOU'RE COMING, I WANT TO SEE YOU. I LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT IN PERSON. Girl, how is it possible that your husband beats you all up and you are so calm? Hello. That's a huge thing. He regrets it later and begs me to forgive me. Estrellita, what should I do with this man? Hit him back! Estrellita is unbelievable. - Excuse me, do you have any rooms? - On today's show: "My husband hits me and then says he's going to change." There's a room available in thirty minutes. - Shall we take a walk? - Let's go. It's a beautiful night. I had never seen so many stars. If you see a shooting star don't forget to make a wish. - What if I see a UFO? - That too. The important thing is to ask the universe, the aliens or whoever is up there. - I just saw one! - One what? - A shooting star. - Where? Oh, no! It's Delirio! I got confused! Cocksucker! Beautiful! It's not bad. It's been a while since I last played. The day Valentina told me she was pregnant, I got scared. So scared I even peed myself. Really. The day you were born was the best day in my life. You were so small that I was afraid to hold you, but I did. I held you... and you peed yourself. It must be a family thing. Happy birthday. Thank you. What? Today is your birthday? Yes. Today is the 25th. So exciting! Happy birthday! - I'm pregnant. -What? Do you want to scare me to death! Girl, that's horrible! Well, not horrible! I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. Yes, it's horrible! Just now that I decided to leave Ivan! How am I? Better than eating with your fingers. Don't be vulgar! There will be no girl that resists you. It's you who she is waiting for. Be yourself. I'm sure she'll like you. I'm sorry. We are full. Excuse me, gentleman, we have come from Caracas especially for this event. Is there any way, as small as it may be, to fix this? What would you like to drink? Champagne to start. The best. Right away. Don't get drunk. When have you seen me drunk? Don't answer that, please. Dad, there she is. Ask her to dance. - I can't. I'm scared shitless. - Yes, you can. Get close and when you are talking to her, look at her lips at some point as if you didn't care for her that much. What do you know of hitting on girls? Believe me, it works on girls and guys. Go on. - Don't pee yourself. - Dad! Hello. Shall we dance? I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone. - Your boyfriend? - No, a friend. While you wait for him, you could dance with me. It's just that... I don't think that friend will mind. Besides, today is my birthday. Congratulations. I see how you were celebrating. It's a long story. What do you say? I'm sorry, but no. Thanks. Fine. Sorry to insist, but this is my favourite tango and I would really like to dance it with you. Really? Mine too! What a coincidence. Would you dance this song with me? Sure, why not? What's up? No tears. Let's dance! Good, I'm thirsty! Excuse me. I have the feeling I know you from somewhere. Really? Your face seems familiar as well. Nice to meet you, Luis Fernando Rivas. My pleasure, Delirio Del Rio. Del Rio? Like Dolores, but Delirio. I'm from San Felipe. San Felipe? Just like me. I'm sure that's where we know each other from. Maybe, though I left to Caracas when I was little. I came to M?rida around fifteen years ago. My partner is from here, that's why I came. Of course, love. Yes. Here he comes. Finally, I found you. Just here talking to a compatriot. This is Delirio. He is Victor, my partner. A pleasure. Likewise. I need the keys because I left the cellphone in the car. See you in a while. A pleasure. Likewise. What a surprise. I didn't know you were... I know why I find you familiar. You look so much like a friend from my childhood, Alejo Duarte. Of course, it's just that I am... his sister. What a coincidence! How is he? He died. A long time ago. Rum on the rocks. Rum? Don't drink anymore. That's not good for the baby. I'm not having it. Why not? This child would be the excuse not to break up with lv?n and I don't want that. You are just making up excuses. Think about what you are going to do. There's nothing to think about. It's decided. My friend must be on his way. Maybe he will not come. He will. I'm sure. And I hope he dances as well as you do. Me? Dance well? Not at all. Tango is hard, you just make it look easy. Thank you. What part of Spain are you from? I was born in Caracas, but I went to Madrid when I was little. I am... From here, from M?rida. I know. Of course, it must be the accent. You have everything I like about a girl. You kiss as well as you dance. The truth is that I wanted to meet you, Armando, and see the true face of The Lie. THE LIE I like you more than that kid, it's a shame you didn't show yourself to me as you are because we get along well. Laura, you will think I'm a fool, but I used that guy's picture because I was afraid... afraid you would reject me. I'm sorry. It's too late. - Let me walk you! - No, you better not. Thank you. Laura! Please, Laura! There is something inside of me that I can't control and that makes me feel insecure and I understand perfectly that you are upset with me, but please forgive me. I have nothing to forgive you and I really hope you solve your problem. Laura, we were having a great time, let's forget this, OK? Let me get to know you better. Let me fix this mess. Please. - Good bye. - Laura... Laura! I'm going to miss you a lot, son. Always remember that I love you. I love you a lot too, pal. Grandpa. Don't argue with grandma so much. Armandito, it's the only way I don't get bored. Grandma. My boy. Take care of yourself. There are many whores and gold diggers over there! Don't worry grandma; I know how to take care of myself. God bless you. I love you. Stop crying, mom. Let me drain, Dieguito; I'm very stressed. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Perla Marina. Well, meeting both of you. Take care, OK? You too. Don't forget about us. Never. Stop crying, dammit! You're making the poor Sea Weed cry. Paco, let me be... Dammit! Where is Delirio at? Drop that page over there, please. Delirio, tell us something. I don't know, whatever you want to say. My name is Delirio Del Rio. Like Dolores, but Delirio. Many years ago I was called Aleio and I fell in love with Luis Fernando, but he liked girls. Afterwards I got my operation and changed my name because a girl named Aleio sounds a bit weird. Now I'm a girl but Luis Fernando likes boys. It's a long story, but don't worry, I'm not in a hurry. Done. It took me a while to convince him. Crist?bal, you are sure he's not messing with you, right? Trust me. I've been after him for a while. Get Diego a whisky double. You are going to need it. That night I was on my way to work and I saw there was a fight so I stayed back. Then I thought of recording the video because, well, one never knows. I don't want any trouble with these people or the police because I have a criminal record... - How much do you want? - Five grand. Mr. Martinez, you can't come in without notifying first. Leave it there. How are you feeling, my love? Ivan, I hope I've made it clear that we are not getting back together. Forgive me already. I changed. Perla, I can't live without you. Believe me, please. Well, you will have to. You can see the kid, you are his father and you will always be, but you and I are over. Come here! Don't even think about touching me! Excuse me. Mom, take Ivan to the door. He's leaving already. There's no need, Margarita. Let me know when the kid is born. What's with these knitted pink shoes? What? You don't like them? It's not that, they are cute, but what if you have a boy? You are not going to make him wear pink shoes. I don't know who came up with that idea that blue is for boys and pink is for girls. I like both colours. It would have been easier if the doctor told you the sex of the child. You are fixated in not knowing. What's the difference? Of course it's different, because if they tell you it's a girl I could buy her some gold earrings, like when you were born. Mom! I think it's time! What? Oh, my God! And the cradle isn't finished yet! Hello? Who is this? Hello ma'am, how are you? How is she? What? Now? Don't worry, it's coming. Everything is going to be alright. Everything is going to be alright. Congratulations. It's a boy. What's his name? Fabrizio. His name is Fabrizio. Give him a kiss on my behalf. Yes, you are the one that has to behave. You should find a guy that likes you and settle down. OK, I will tell her. OK, yes, bye. - Hello mom. Dad says hi. - How is he? Fine. Perla Marina had a child. Perla Marina? She has a soap opera name. More like a soap musical. What are you going to do today? - I'm seeing a girl this afternoon. - Well, well. OK, what do you want to eat? Estrellita Mata will not be able to continue on with her show. Damn it! Starting today, a new show. Welcome to... Delirio Nights. Hello? - Dieguito, son... - What's wrong mom? Calm down. Son, Delirio... your friend... she's in... Your transvestite friend is hosting Estrellita's show! Fuck that, she's not a transvestite. It is her, damn it, turn the TV on. OK, I'll call you later. DELIRIO NIGHTS How many times have we pointed fingers at other people because they are different? Different in way of thinking, way of walking, way of dressing, talking or loving. We mistreat other people because we consider them below us or less intelligent or because they have different skin color. Fabrizio, let me introduce you to your aunt Delirio. A woman with a pair of high heels. We make jokes about some because they belong to other cultures and have different customs and beliefs. We feel with the right to judge other just because they have a different opinion than ours and we forget we live in a plural society, where everyone has a place and where everyone should be listened to. And even more so the mistreated minorities that suffer a silent discrimination. Tonight, in Delirio Nights, a program about diversity. "I am how I am, so what?" Let's receive out first guest. BLUE AND NOT SO PINK TO YOU... DEAR FATHER
