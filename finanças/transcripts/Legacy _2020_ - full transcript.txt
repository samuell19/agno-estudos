Invitation. What's this? It's not an invitation. It's an arrest warrant for your boss. Excuse me. Wrong invitation. Before you do anything stupid... Like this? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? You come here and interrupt my son's wedding. I've killed for less. I know. You're a hard man to find, Rasto. It's Mr. Boranovic. We just missed each other three years ago in Berlin. You looked right at me in Caracas in '09, remember that? Doesn't matter now. You're the Interpol man. MI6, actually, but yes. You have no authority to arrest me here. You're right, I don't. But they do. In my country, I'm a hero. They will not extradite me. They already have. 20 minutes from now, you'll be on a plane heading to The Hague. You really want a bloodbath at your son's wedding, Mr. Boranovic? Get him out of here. I'll be home in a week. - One week! - We'll see. Hey, man. Jesus, Jake, - what are you doin'? - Dad, I, I'm sorry. I forgot, okay, I was out... Jake, you were supposed to take your medicine four hours ago, man. I know, I'm sorry. I just forgot. Stop apologizing to me, okay? It's not about me. It never has been. We've been through this. Okay, just, just listen to me for a second. Understand this, you can do whatever you want in this life, okay? Whatever it is you want, but the one thing that you can never, ever do is forget to take your medicine. You with me? Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Yeah. I'm sorry, man, I just... I, I'm sorry. I just forgot, Dad. It's okay. It's okay. You hungry? You want something to eat, maybe? Uh, I was actually gonna go shoot the bow for a little bit. If you want, come out and shoot it with me? Sounds good. I'll join you out there in a little bit, okay? Hey. Hey! How many times I tell you not to sit in my chair? You know, the bathroom floor needs cleanin'. Damn kid. Hey, baby, it's me. Oh, my God, I've been so worried. How did it go? Everything went fine. You know how they are. They like to kick and scream more than they actually like to fight. Nolan, this guy's not your normal suspect. You said, what? He's already killed three witnesses? You don't need to worry about that. Of course I'm gonna worry about it. Well, we got a great case and good news is we finally have him in custody. He's landed four hours ago. Oh, great, we can't wait to see you. Nolan? - Nolan? - Look, honey I'm so sorry. There's nothing I can do about this, but I have to fly to the States before I come home. You've been gone a month trying to find this guy. I know. One more piece of evidence. Gotta get it tied up before Boranovic sees the judge Monday morning, that's all. You told Shelly you'd be home already. And I thought I would be. Look, I'll call her after school, okay? Baby, 20 years. You've done your part. Someone else can take it from here. Emma, we've already spoken about this. Nolan. It's just the things I've seen this man do. I know, I know. No, you don't, baby. No, you don't, you haven't seen the things I've seen. And I'm not about to let our daughter grow up in world where men like this walk free. Certainly not while I can do something about it. Do what you gotta do. We miss you is all. I miss you, too. I'll be home in a couple of days. Yeah. Now, please try not to worry, okay? Dangerous part's over now. I love you. You too. I go to court in one week, and as we speak, there's an agent en route collecting evidence. Hello? Yes, get it done in a week, and I'll pay you double. And if you don't, you'll get nothing. Yes, completely dissolved. No body, no blood, no trace. Like they never existed. Okay, so what do you say? 40, 50? Like, all right, 50. - Yeah. - Copy. - Yeah, I like that. - Okay, it's a lock. - Hey, Jake. - Hey. Uh, check this out. New arrowheads. Just became regulation. Where'd you get these? Wait a minute, is this the charge that went on my credit card? I, I, I didn't think you'd mind. Oh, come on, Jake. What're you thinkin', man? Dad, they increased lethality, okay? So you don't have to go chasing a blood trail through the woods. Does it change the flight? Website says no. Well, it doesn't matter, okay? You still should have come to me. It's a little irresponsible, don't you think? He asked me first. Oh, did he? I told him it was okay. My credit card's maxed out this month. Okay, fine, but you still should have come to me. - I mean... - Dad. Hey, it's a little excessive, don't you think, guys? - Come on. - He knows what he's doing. I, I just wanted it to be a surprise for our trip, okay? Oh, it's a surprise all right. Hey, let him do something nice for his father. He can work off the money later, right? Yes, I'll work it off. Frank, just relax. - We're on vacation. - Okay. This is the summer house. You live for the summer house, right? - Yes. - Just relax. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, it's fine. We'll use it. It's no problem, we'll use it. But just talk to me next time. Just talk to me. I'm gonna get my guard. Okay. Mm, because that's so easy, right? Listen. He loves you. - You know that. - I know. He's just been on high alert since you arrived. It's all he knows how to do. He can't help it. Thanks for covering for me. You really should have asked first. I know. Let me see that. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty badass, right? Mm hm. Hey, Daddy, watch me. It's okay, it's not bad. Try again. Compensate for the wind. Reference the trees, it helps a lot. Listen, I'm thinking your kill shot's still around 40 yards, but I wanna know how you're gonna do with a still shot, okay? How can you do holding and waiting for the prey to show its perfect face, okay? - Okay. - Try it, let's see it. I want you to hold. Okay, hold. Release. Not bad at all. Not bad at all, Jake. Give me a look at that? Still got a long way to catch the old man. Keep at it, you're looking good. - Yeah. - Okay, keep at it. Fuck! Excuse me, you know where I can find... No, no, just the bags. What do you mean? This year we're goin' full survival. Gonna eat what we catch. We're gonna cook it on a spit, gonna hang the meat up overnight so the bears don't eat it. We're gonna boil the water we find. We're goin' old school, pal. Except sleep in a bag. That's right, Jake. It does get a little cold out there, doesn't it? Drop that. Cool. Yeah, cool. Okay. Get rid of that, lock this up, we gotta pick up the ATVs on the way. Okay. - Hey. - Hey, almost ready? Yeah, we're good. Have so much fun. Be safe. Bring me something awesome. Take care of my baby. - I love you. - I love you. - So long. - Okay. - See you. - Okay, bye. You, have fun. - I will. - Be safe. Okay. Take care of each other. I'll take care of myself. Be good. All right. Don't have too much fun here without us, though. All right. Do you like it, Daddy? He didn't even finish dumpin' the trash. He didn't lock up. He didn't call, nothin'. It was like he vanished. Think Boranovic tracked him down? Look, I think we have a problem here. First kid has disappeared. That tracks. Interpol got a call from the adoption agency. They've uncovered a hack. When? A few days ago. Forensics tracked the activity. They only took one file. The John Doe on the Boranovic boys. Well, how did they even know where to look? No idea. But they're not new to cybercrime. If it was them, Rasto knows everything now including the names and location of both offspring. Got it. Look, we're done here. We have an open case, I mean shouldn't we... Look, Rasto is extremely selective. He's used the same worker for years. He's a ghost. If this isn't him, locals can handle it. But if it is, then the boy's long gone. Nothing more we can do here. We need to go find Jake Kimber. Can I help? Oh, oh, I'm good. Really? Um, no, I'm good. Thank you. I don't mind. I got it. I'm tryin' to find my way back to the, uh, the highway. Just go back the way that you came. What kind of logger gets lost in the woods? Guess I just got turned around. Look at me. Look at me. I don't have to hurt you. Down. Down. Damn it. At the cabin this week for the annual hunting trip with my dad. I'm gonna link the map down in the description so you guys can check it out. And I got a new bow, which I'm hoping to christen with a beautiful 12 point. And it's not rifle season, so me and my dad are gonna be the only ones out there. It's gonna be pretty amazing. Seems like we should've brought horses instead. Well, I didn't wanna overwhelm you. Wouldn't bother me. I'd hunt horseback, Indian style. Yeah, well, before the Spanish came, the Natives did hunt on foot. So, we already are, then? One of us is. They didn't have little wheels on their bows. Okay, okay. Okay, man, listen up. I don't think this path takes us all the way down to the valley floor. So, we'll take this one till it ends, dump the quads, and continue on foot. - Sound good to you? - Yep. - We locked? - Yeah. You have the key? - Yep. - Cool. Sweet. Here comes the cops. June, we are 10-eight at the Kimber property. And be advised, our federal friends are already on scene. Don't let 'em push you around, Sheriff. But be nice. I'm always nice. That woman. Gentlemen. They're weekenders. A couple o' weeks during the summers, mostly. They're fine enough people, yeah. Truck's gone. But Frank and his son plan a big hunting trip every year about this time, so. And what about the car? That belong to the wife? Yeah. Maybe she's out with friends, who knows? Well, maybe you can help us find her? We thank you for your assistance. Yeah, well, when the FBI tells you to do somethin', I guess you do it, huh? Hell, even if they are foreign. You think you might be able to help us get inside, Sheriff? Why, hell, I don't know how y'all do it in Her Majesty's domain. Over here, on this side of the pond, ownership's 9/10ths of the law. We cannot barge into the house without a duly executed warrant and you know that. When lives are in danger... I believe that's reasonable grounds. No matter where you are. - Yeah. - Sir. Yeah, yeah. Now tell me, what reason might that be, son? That's on a need-to-know. It's my county. Jesus Christ. Gray, you hear what I just said? - I did. - Oh, hell. Doctrine of Plainview, Sheriff. We are within our rights. Aw, hell. Hey, asshole, when my father's talkin', you listen! Take it easy, boy. Oh, Christ almighty. Don't say a word. Oh, yeah. No, yeah. No, boy. What the hell you doin', huh? - I told you to stay with me. - Gray. You'll screw up this crime scene. By the time they're done here, that kid'll be long dead. Bureau forensics will be here in an hour. For 20 years. I'll be damned if my office is gonna mess this up. Okay, good. Look, keep an eye on these guys, will you? I'm gonna take a look around. Jake Kimber had a Facebook page deleted today after he and his father left to go hunting. Hey and one more thing. The kid's a hemophiliac. Well, that doesn't make this any easier. No, Sheriff? Mr. Gray. I am going to apologize to you. I didn't take your word. No harm done, Sheriff. We're on the same team, anyway. Besides, I think this guy, he's been one step ahead of all of us, anyway. Yeah, well, I decided to call the pro shop. Frank, he took out an archery permit. He didn't list where he was goin'. You think they're still alive? Truthfully, I don't know. But I hope so. I've been waitin' a long time to come back up here, Jake. I mean, this is, this is awesome. Yeah. Wow, I mean. Hey, that looks like a good spot for base camp, yeah? Yeah. Hm. - You bedding there? - Yeah. - Okay. - Looks soft. I'll park it here, we got our fire. Good. I mean, this thing's gonna come in so handy. Glad you picked that thing up, right? I remember how excited you were when we bought that. Get the rocks and don't tell Ma. Okay. No one really seems to listen, though. Oh, God, gorgeous, isn't it? Come on, what're you doin'? You think you're in college already? Let's move. Your snoring kept me up all night. That was the plan. So, today we're gonna lighten up the load, just take one backpack. You good? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, last one. We better bag a buck, or we'll be eatin' dandelions all day. - Do me a favor? - Mm hm? Put the ammo in yours? - Mm. - Good. Oh, no, no. Allow me. I'd feel bad if I didn't shoulder the burden. And I'd feel bad if you didn't. Hey, you hear that? What? It sounds like another engine. Well, it's not rifle season, and a little too far out for someone to be takin' a joyride. Let's orange up just in case. All right. And it's not rifle season, so me and my dad are gonna be the only ones out there. It's gonna be pretty amazing. So, Sheriff, I'm assuming a helicopter won't be a problem for you. Search and rescue get us up there? Oh, Christ. My only chopper's on loan, fightin' them damn fires in Utah. What are my options? I camped up there before. We're gonna need ATVs, four by fours and whatever... Yeah, how long to get up there? Two hours. Fuck. Well, I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but I just think we - can't just go up there... - This isn't about rain on a fucking parade, kid. This is about saving lives, you hear me? Frank and Jake Kimber. We don't find them by nightfall, I can guarantee you they'll be dead and buried. Who's this fella who's huntin' 'em, anyway? He's a monster. Son, you wanna give us a minute? He can get you to the trailhead. Look, I know he's green behind the ears. Yeah, and that's exactly why he's not coming. He knows this valley as good as anyone. He can put you right down on top of 'em. Look, he is my son, and I think he needs this. He stands in my way for one second, I'll leave him where he stands. I can respect that. All right, I'm gonna stay here. I'm gonna try and rustle up some eyes in the sky, get some resources together. I'm gonna see you in the valley. Thank you. Gray? You take care of my boy, huh? That's Frank Kimber's truck. You know who this one belongs to? I don't know that one. You wanna run a plate check on it? Yeah, it won't take a minute. Gray, take a look at this. Hey, look. Tracks. They had three sets. Run a search for a stolen ATV? That we could do. It's just gonna tell us who he killed to get it. There's nothin' on the truck itself. But the registered owner's wife filed a missing person two days ago. And apparently ain't found him yet. They're not going to. Deputy, you know this area pretty well, huh? Yeah. There's a steep climb into the valley and that's the only trail in. But we could hike around the ridge and flank 'em. It's a good idea. So, what's the visual on the valley from up there? Well, I brought my drone. I'm kind of a hobbyist, but, uh, I think I could probably go pro. Looks like he trashed their ATVs. Good news, it means he's still here. Mean's he hasn't killed 'em yet. Why would they leave the quads so far from the valley floor? There's no trails down there, and it's just too rugged. Plus, the engines scare off the prey. So, what's the flight time of this thing? About 20 minutes? Maybe? Well, I guess we'll find out. So, which way you wanna hunt, Jake? I think I'm gonna go that way. Okay, good. What do you mean, good? Obviously, you didn't see the deer tracks headin' off in that direction. But, hey, if you wanna go down that way, be my guest, but you might starve to death. I'm gonna go this way. Gunshot, gunshot. What was that? Jesus, Jake, somebody's shootin' at us. Jesus Christ. Hey! Stop shooting! There are people down here! Ah, god damn you! - Shit! - Hunters down here for Christ's sake! If somebody makes a mistake like that, they're supposed to identify themselves and come down to make sure that nobody's injured. Doesn't make any sense. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Have you been hit? - No, no, no. - Are you sure? Yeah, just, it scared me. Okay. Jesus! What the,. Something's wrong. Oh, God. Okay, someone is definitely shooting at us. So, ditch those, but hold onto 'em. We might need them later on, okay? Okay, okay. Seems to me this guy's at least 600 yards away. - The gun, the gun. - Jake, come back here! Jesus Christ, what are you doing? I'm fine, I'm fine, we need the gun. Just take the gun. Here, here. - Dad. - Yeah? Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Damn it. Okay, that means we better be back to base camp - within 24 hours, am I right? - Yeah, 24 hours. Okay. Right now, we gotta make it to the water. - Okay. - It'll lead us back to camp. Stay low, hug the rocks. Let's move. Watch your step here. Let's take five. You okay? Look, he could be chasing us. We should, we should either go through the water, or find a place somewhere down here to hide and wait for him. I don't know, Jake, neither one sounds like a good idea to me. We're too exposed in the water. We'd have to draw him real close to be of any effect. Jesus, what is that? You hear that? Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like, it's a drone! Jesus, you think it's his? I mean, it seems like we would have heard it before. Could it be someone else? Is it a search party? Why would anyone be searching for us? Well, it's either him or it's someone else, but if it's someone else, we're gonna miss our chance at being seen. Okay, let's just stay behind the rocks for now. There you go. Come on, you see that? Can you see that? There, right there, you see him? Come on. Jesus, he just shot it down. Well, that proves it's not his. Oh, fuck. Fuck, you hit? No, I don't, I don't think so. Oh, fuck. Fuck, we gotta go. Move, stay low, stay low. Down, down, move, move! Move! There's somebody flying that thing, right? Where's the closest ridgeline, Jake? Uh, closest ridgeline's that way. Can you make it? - Yeah. - You good? - Yeah. - Be careful, let's go. Come on, come on. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Okay, we still have the radio in the truck, right? Okay, get back there. Tell your father we need backup right now. If I can't make it back to the truck, you're out here alone. You know what we're up against, right? Okay. We better get to the Kimbers. Stay with me. Frank Kimber! We're not here to hurt you. Then step out and show me your hands! We're not the ones shooting at you. But he's not far behind us. Who the hell are you? We're stepping out. Don't shoot. Keep your hands up, Deputy. Stay. Easy, easy. It's okay. Okay, who are you and what's goin' on? Now, you know the deputy here, huh? Yeah. My name's Nolan Gray from British Intelligence. I'm here to protect you both. We've already lost one of our team, Agent Butler from the FBI. There's information, sir, you don't know about your son here. You are both in grave danger, more than you could possibly imagine. I need to know what's goin' on. And I'm happy to tell you. On the move. We need to leave right now. Son. Do we have a choice? Please. Okay, okay. Deputy, lead the way. - It's a climb. - Stay close. But this is the only way out. Come on, double time. During the civil wars of Yugoslavia, there were war lords who operated their own private armies. One of these men operated on a particularly brutal scale. He was called The Tiger. Many of that war's worst massacres were carried out by his men. He would cleanse entire villages of anyone he would consider inferior; Croats, Bosniaks, Jews, Kosovars. Kill the men and use their women as his personal toys. Slaves to abuse as he pleased. There's no telling how many women and girls he assaulted. He kept them until he was bored with them or until they became pregnant. Paperwork said Jake's mother and father were killed in the war. That's because some agencies decided to not let truth get in the way of protecting a child. Especially when they're a war criminal. Wait, wait, wait are you saying, are you saying that I was conceived in a rape? Jesus. Your biological father, Jake, is a man named Rasto Boranovic. He was indicted for war crimes including what he did to your mother. We've been hunting him for 20 years, and last week we got him. He's in custody awaiting trial in The Hague. And that's why we're being shot at? Boranovic disappeared along with his private army. He's become a very powerful figure in organized crime, exporting drugs into Eastern Europe. Always buys from a cartel in Mexico. Now, they lose their Boranovic, they lose a huge foothold in the market. The man hunting you, he's a professional killer. He'll kill every one of us to get to you. But how does killing these two protect Boranovic? Because Jake here is the evidence that will put him away. Jake, your biological mother's still alive. She's going to testify. Now, with your DNA and her story, we put Boranovic, your father, away for... Don't call him my father! He's not my father. Who caught this guy? I did. What about my mother? My biological mother? When I found her, she was in Sarajevo. She's taking a great risk testifying. She's a brave woman, Jake. Okay, look, this doesn't make any sense. There's gotta be more evidence than just Jake. Oh, we have a lot of evidence, Frank. Most of it's circumstantial. We did find another offspring, a half-brother to you. But four days ago, he disappeared. And we haven't found a trace of him. How did this guy find us all the way out here? Did he go to my house? Is my wife okay? No. Oh, God, no. We haven't found a body yet. - Deputy! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait so, she could still be alive? - Please, Jake. - No, no, she could! She could, yes. But the way the man does things, we don't find bodies, Jake. He makes people disappear. That's what he does. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Frank. They killed my mom because of me? Did they kill my mom because of me? No, Jesus, no. Based upon the shot that killed my partner, he's a mile, maybe less, behind us. I'm sorry, Frank, we have to keep moving. I'm sorry. Oh, Jesus, no. Dad. Dad, I'm so sorry. Frank. Frank, we've gotta keep moving. We have to leave. Lead us out of here, Deputy. Come on. June? They should've been back by now. Any word? Not since this morning. All right. Just keep me posted, huh? So, you work for the International Criminal Court? No. Right now, I'm kind of on loan from British Intelligence. I was airborne 10 years. It was a boring time for an American warrior. No Afghanistan, no Iraq. Best we got was Panama and Grenada. Well, you know how that works. Luck of the draw, right? But you came home. - I'm a lucky guy. - Yeah. Look, I really appreciate you tryin' to save my boy. But I'm curious, why do it? Why risk your life for another country? I mean, I thank God every day for Jake, but I'm curious, what you do? You think it'll really make a difference? I hope so. What I do know, Frank, is apathy changes nothing, and the way I see things, a parent losing a child, it's the same pain no matter where you're from. I'm tired of borders deciding who we help and who we don't. But there'll always be plenty who get away, and there will always be those to replace them. You're right. Human nature. Maybe the threat of life in prison stops one man. Then we're saving lives. Come on. You okay there, Frank? I, I may need a minute. Okay, yeah. Let's catch our breath. Are you sure it's just one guy tracking us? No. But I think if there was more, they'd be triangulating us by now. Well, if it's just one guy, why don't we triangulate him? Jake, I don't think you understand the situation you're in. This man's been killing people since he was a teenager. If we want any chance of staying alive in this thing, we stay one step ahead of him. Now, we didn't check in which means search and rescue is behind us. We get that blood sample, we get the DNA here officially on record. Killing Jake serves no purpose for them, then. Look, we stay out of his way, and we wait for backup. But it could take at least another day to get more men out here. We don't have another day. Jake needs to take his medicine. Look, I'm fine as long as I don't bleed. And what if you do bleed? What if you get shot? What if you fall and bruise? Safest bet, we go back through base camp. Frank, listen, I saw it. Your ATVs are trashed and everything you had. We head that way, we're heading straight for him. There's a little town called Titus. It's about 12 miles from here. It's really just a bar and a gas station, but it's the closest place to find people. Good, let's do that. No, no, no, no way! Keep your fucking voice down. I am trying to keep you alive. Do you hear me? I know this man. He's a very dangerous human being. We keep moving. I agree with Gray. You're a fucking coward. Jake, that is enough. Hey, get moving. Get up, get up, get up. Get a handle on your boy. Hey. Stay calm, we'll get through this, okay? - Okay. - Come on. Is there any way we can get that chopper back here by dawn? Aw, hell no, son. Christ, look, I got three men unaccounted for. I need to be in the air at first light. June, can you come in here? Yeah, Sheriff? I need you to call Bill Miller. - Bill Miller? - Yes, Bill Miller. I know he's an ass, but his brother and he's got that crop duster, yeah? - Yeah? - All right. Ask him to have that thing here first thing in the morning. All right, I'll call him. You doin' okay? I'm sorry for the way I acted earlier. Jake, you have nothing to be sorry for. A lot of things have changed for you today. You've been braver than most. I, uh, I just feel like my whole life's a lie. I can't believe my mom's dead. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to go through this. You know, I see how much your dad loves you. He wants you to be strong. You have to be strong for each other. You know that? I'm gonna keep an eye open tonight, Jake. Try and get some rest if you can. Hang in there. Hang in there. I heard motorcycles. That could be the search party. Not a chance. They'll be coming in by air or by foot. He's right, son. Look, I found the perfect spot. High ground over here. Perfect for cover. No matter what, they don't know where you are. Do not compromise your position. He's right, stay put, stay low. What if you don't come back? We keep moving. - You got this? - Yeah. Let's move out, come on. They're headed your way. Spread out and wait. Let's play. Get down. He's coming back, right? He knows what he's doing. Ah, I should have killed you in Budapest when I had the chance. I don't remember you having a chance. This didn't need to happen. Now, you start listening to me. We need to move. Come on, we gotta go, come on. Let's go. Stay with me. Hey, you see anyone? No, we're clear. Hey, hey, hey. How bad is it? It's bad. I don't know, maybe it's a disc. I just, I need rest. I'm just gonna slow you guys down. Then we stay here and finish this, and wait for search and rescue. They gotta be close. Are you sure? You can't make it? Jake, we can't make assumptions. We don't know how many people are out there. I gotta get you to Titus. No, no, no! Fuck that! Son, you're already on borrowed time. Come on, we've been through this. All it takes is a bruise, a gunshot. No way, Dad. I cannot lose you, too. Listen to me, okay? Just listen to me. I can make it out here. I can survive, come on, you know me! There's plenty of food. I'll be, I'll be fine. I'll be fine, okay? I'll be fine. Your only hope is for you guys to get out and come back with help. There's no other choice. I'm coming back for you. Oh, I know you will. Jake. Come on, get outta here. I'll get him! Got you. Come on, Frank. Come on. Jesus. Where's the boy? I have no clue. Where's the boy? What do you want me to say? He took a left at the evergreen? Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you, so come on. Go ahead. Did you kill my wife? Did you? Did you? Oh. Oh, is Sarah here? She's, um, she's incapacitated. Oh, nothin' serious, I hope. No, no. Um, she's, uh, she's just not available. I'm the gardener. Oh, well, uh, could, could you see that she gets these? We just wanted to welcome 'em back. They're really nice people. - Very nice. - Real neighborly. Okay, I'll, um, I'll let her know you came by. If, if, if you wanna sneak a couple of those, I won't tell anybody. And now my son? Your son? He's not your son. He's not your blood. Why do you care? Why do I,. I spent 18 years of my life raising him. Watching him grow. Teaching him right from wrong. It's obvious to me that you never had a father do the same thing for you. Uh uh. Gray. Yeah, I know. Look, Jake, going back there right now goes against everything we should be doing. Fuck it. Let's go get him. Come on. It's an ambush. He doesn't know we're here. Oh, Jesus. Okay, you're gonna have to go ahead without me. No, no, I can help you. No, I made a promise to your dad. You go this way. A mile, maybe two. Find a place to hide. You wait for me. You don't see me in one hour, get to that town by dark. Okay? - Okay. - Go on, Jake, go. Oh, shit. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Shit. Gray! Can you hear me? I'm unarmed. Turn around. It's just me. You know, I always wondered how things would end up between us. You? Seems you have the advantage. Stay where you are. I have enough reasons to kill you. Gray, always by the book. And now you're gonna arrest me? Yeah. Probably should. Might go look for that, uh, little daughter of yours, that pretty wife, if you don't. Tryin' to push my buttons, Z? We could settle it here. Just the two of us. - If you want. - I don't. I'm gonna walk you in. You're going to stand trial, Z. In that case. Hand me the tele, the telephone. The telephone. She's, she's just learning. Mine, too. Hope, hope she knows how, how proud I am of her. She will. Is it done? It's done. Dad! Dad! Is that you, Jake? - Oh, Jesus Christ. - I'm okay. Are you okay? - Are you shot? - It was just a graze. I'm okay. The rest helped, but I'm still in a little pain. Jesus, Jake, you're cut. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm okay, I have time. Can you walk? Where's Gray? - Let's go. - Okay. Come on. Come on. Okay. Oh, oh, got you. - Mom, Dad! - Help me. I got you, okay, okay. We've got you. Are you good? I got you. Jake, relax. You look good. Do my shoes match my belt? That's a thing, right? - Shoes and belts? - Jake. Listen, it's your mother. Your biological mother. She brought you into this world. And I promise you, she's going to love you. Okay. Okay? Okay. You know, I wanted to mention, if you want to meet the man that... My biological father? Uh, no, no. There's no need. I, I don't owe him anything. Your family's what you make it, right? - Is that her? - It is. It's that time, Jake. You gonna go see her? Thank you. Go on, get outta here. Change of plans. I'm coming home.
