[Crowd chanting] Think or Swim! We're back, everybody. Y'all know what time it is. Jeffrey, it's think or swim time! [crowd cheers] And for the grand prize, what is your -final answer? -Come on, Jeffrey. You know this. -I know you know this. -[host] Time is running out. [Jeffrey] Think. Think! Oh, no. My mind just went blank. I need an answer. Now I'm having random thoughts for no reason. Has this ever happened to you? Has your brain ever stopped working mid-thought -or when you're stressed? -Yes! And um who are you? What if I could show you ways to get better at thinking under pressure -or how not to lose your train of thought? -Awesome. Come to think of it, where do thoughts come from in the first place? [birds tweeting] Do you have your answer? Please, you gotta give me an answer. -Beat it. -Ah, you're no help. Get ready to change the way you think about thinking on Brainchild. Hey! Hello! What are you doing? No, seriously, think about it. Right now, what are you doing? Okay, yeah, you're watching the show. Duh! But... what else? Awake or asleep, you're never just doing one thing. That's 'cause your brain is always thinking. And it's thinking about a lot. So, the big question is, why do some thoughts just pop into your head? ♪ Word pop mania ♪ ♪ Mania. ♪ We're gonna show you five words, you have 3 seconds to work out what they have in common. Ready? Go! Did you say all five were liquids you can drink? Nice! Here's another one. Time's up! What did you say for this one? All five are animals. More specifically, they're all mammals. Did you notice how the answer just popped into your head? So, let's play one more. Got your answer? Did it just pop into your head for this one, or are you feeling a bit more like this guy? Errrrrrrrrrrrrrr? Take another look. Those objects have nothing in common, but the words do. Can you spot what it is? In case you're still struggling, here's the answer. All of those words begin with a vowel. Ooh, tricky. Did you get it, or did your brain come up short? I'll let you in on a little secret. We created this test specifically to make the answers pop into your brain for each question, except for the last one, and the difference reveals something amazing about your brain. Your brain has two ways of thinking. Scientists call this System 1 and System 2. Think of System 1 as your fast, impulsive friend who keeps it real and gives you those "aha!" moments. System 2 is calm, collected, and calculated, doing everything by the book and slowing down in order to analyze a problem. System 1 is who shouted... -Liquids!... Animals! -...during these games. Alright! -However... -Heads up, bro! ...System 1 is also the one who let you down when we showed you five seemingly random words. -Sorry, dude. -To solve that puzzle... A, E, I, O, U. ...you needed to engage the slow, analytical thinking skills of System 2. Most amazing thing about both systems of thought is how fast they work. "Aha!" moments in your brain seem to happen in the blink of an eye, don't they? So just how fast does your brain think, anyway? Let's find out. Think fast! Here's how it works. We're gonna show you a red screen. As soon as the red screen turns green, press pause on your remote or device and note the number of seconds on the timer. This is your reaction time. It measures how quickly a thought can move through your body. Got it? Let's try one to warm up. Remember, when the screen turns green, press pause and note the number on the timer. Get ready! Were you able to capture your time? Okay. We're gonna try it for real now. Hands over those pause buttons and really try to react as fast as you can. Got your time? Okay. So you should have your rough reaction time in hundredths of a second. Now let's see how your speed of thought stacks up against our participants. And go! Yes! Go! Not yet... Go! Yes! Forty-one! Yeaaah! So, how did their scores compare to yours? Chances are, even if they were faster, they were probably not much faster. In fact, you probably noticed something weird happening. Everyone's reaction times fell between 40 to 60 100ths of a second. No one's really that much faster, but no one's really slower either. Why is that? It's because you're seeing how fast a thought can actually travel. Isn't that right, Alie? A thought starts in your brain and travels through special channels called nerves that conduct electricity as information. Basically, your body's version of fiber-optic cable, like what brings your Internet. The fastest nerves shoot thoughts from your brain to your muscles at over 250 miles an hour. -And the winner is... your brain! -[crowd cheers] [Sahana] So, while your brain thinks pretty fast, it can still be tricked, as you're about to see in this next illusion with master manipulator Spidey. Hey, guys. My name's Spidey, and we're gonna play The Game With The Red Cards. If you've played it before, don't ruin it for your friends. I'm gonna grab a coupla cards, five to be exact. I'm gonna ask questions about the cards, and all you have to do is answer them. I'll start by showing you the cards. Question number one. It's very simple. In fact, I already answered it. How many cards am I holding in my hand? If you said "five," congratulations. That is 100% correct. I am holding five cards. Take another look. Next question. How many of the cards have red faces? How many of the cards are red? If you said, "Two," you are 100% nailing this game right now. King of hearts, three of diamonds, two red cards. Next question. Is there a value that comes up more than once? In other words, are there two cards that have the same number? If you said "yes," you are the king of this game. You're just owning this right now. There are two threes: a three of diamonds and a three of spades. Now I'm gonna change something. I'm gonna add something. I'm sure you can see how this is different to the others. Take a look. Next question. The card that I added, the different one, in other words, the blue one, what is that card? If you said "eight," you are doing an amazing job. In fact, it's the eight of hearts. Let's do another question. How many of the cards that I'm holding have a red back? How many of these cards are red on this side? If you said "five," you are 100%... incorrect. Now, if you got it wrong, don't worry. Everyone gets it wrong. In fact, people think that it's a magic trick. They think I use magic or sorcery to alter the cards, like, "Burn the warlock!" But I didn't. There's no magic here. The only magic is in your mind. So why did your mind think I had more than one red card? It's because of the way I asked the questions. The language that I used convinced you that there were more. To start, I called it The Game With The Red Cards. That implants the idea that there is more than one red card. Here's how it works. A blue card does start in my pocket. The rest of these cards were always blue except for one. The questions get you to focus on the face of these cards. You almost ignore the backs. You assume they're all red because I keep showing you that same red card. The important part comes when I add the extra card. Your mind assumes that the card is different because it has a blue back, but I never said that. The only way it's different is because it's new. Your mind creates a correlation. It believes that it's different because it has a blue back. So now, due to a series of questions that I've asked, I implanted a thought in your mind. I've convinced you that there are five red cards and only one blue card, when, in fact, the exact opposite is the truth. -[klaxon honks] -Wow! So, sometimes thoughts can steer you in the wrong direction. Hey, watch it! Where do these thoughts even come from in the first place? Like, how does your brain know to think "up" for up... or "popcorn" for when you're hungry? To find out, let's play a little game. ♪ Connect the thoughts. ♪ We're gonna show you three words that don't seem to have a connection. Your job is to think of a shared word that could be added to the front of each of them to make a new word. In this case, you could add the word "hair" to make Okay. You got it. Let's try again with three new words. And remember, the shared word comes before the three words to make a new word. We'll give you five seconds to solve it. Ready? Go! So, were you able to figure it out? By adding the word "sun," you get "sunrise," "sunburn," and "sunset." Let's try again, and we'll make it a little tougher. Ready? Go. All right. Did you come up with the word..."head"? Okay, for our last round, we're gonna make it even tougher, but I believe in you. Ready? Here we go. If you were able to solve this one, nice. Now you might be thinking, "Besides challenging your mind, what do these brainteasers have to do with thinking?" In order to form thoughts, your brain sifts through a vast database of memories, experiences, and images to make connections. So, if you're hungry, the word "food" lights up in your brain along with everything you know about food until you decide what you want to eat. And while this may explain how you were able to solve these brainteasers, it can also help explain where random thoughts come from. Because when you have a thought in one area, it lights up many other areas. For example, you think of a river, not only do words associated with "river" light up, but also words associated with "money"... -What?! -What?! ...because the word "bank" is shared by "river," "riverbank," and also "money," "money bank." In other words, your brain is constantly playing a word-association game like we just played. As it turns out, the random thoughts you have might not be so random. But did you ever wonder why you have irrational thoughts? Let's play a game to find out. Imagine this scenario, it's lunchtime, and the nice lunch lady offers you a choice between pizza or hamburgers. Let's say you pick pizza. Yum! Now, just as she's about to cut you a slice, the lunch lady remembers she also has hot dog... Ooh, hot dog! and you reply, "I'll just take a hamburger." -Yeah, hamburger. -Wait. What? Why would you pick pizza, learn about hot dogs, and switch to a burger? It's completely irrational. I mean, your brain is this marvelous information-processing computer, and computers are never irrational, right? Not exactly. People, including adults, have irrational thoughts all the time, just as you're about to see in this next experiment. Step right up for the raffle of the century! We're at an amusement park, setting up what looks like an ordinary raffle to prove that people don't always think rationally. Right, folks. We've got some great prizes today. [Sahana] We've got prizes like a tablet, headphones, even a new PlayStation, and each raffle ticket only costs five dollars. Five dollars a ticket! Five dollars! But, here's the catch. Before the raffle, I'm gonna offer to buy their five-dollar ticket for ten dollars. Seems like a sweet deal, right? Think these people will go for it? Would you? It's important our test subjects don't know it's an experiment, so I'm hiding the cameras wherever I can, including this sneaky camera in my glasses. Let's see what happens. Step right up, folks, for the raffle of the century! Just $5 for a chance to win. Is that great? -Yeah. -All right. -Thank you. -Enjoy. This one’s for you. -Best of luck to you. -Thank you. -Thanks. -Five bucks each. -Thanks. -Thanks very much. -I want the PS4. -Oh, I think it wants you, too. -Thanks. -Good luck. -All the best. -Thanks so much. Now comes the fun part. I'm gonna offer them twice what they paid for their ticket, and they can simply buy a new ticket and still pocket a $5 profit. Is that what you'd do? Honestly, I think I'm about to lose a lot of money on this deal, but... let's see how it goes. -Hey. Excuse me. -Yes? Okay. Maybe a weird question, but... would I be able to buy that ticket off of you for ten dollars? Absolutely not. You'd make a five-dollar profit! I could win an iPad. What are your odds of winning those prizes? There's loadsa tickets in that box. -I feel lucky. -Feeling lucky? -Have a good one. -Well, thank you. No worries. Okay. How about these two? -Hi. -Hi. I was wondering if I could buy your raffle tickets off of you for ten. Would you give it to me? -I would say yeah. -No. -You would? -Yeah. I mean, it's a $5 profit. Why not? -You'd make $5 right now. -Yeah. -No. -You wouldn't? No. I'm not much interested for taking two. -You'd make $5 right now. -It's up to you, Frank. -It's $10, or you wait for the prize. -Wait for the prize. This is crazy. What is happening? No one wants money on the spot, even though the odds of winning a prize are really low. Let's try to sweeten the deal. How about fifteen dollars? We're gonna keep this, it feels like a lucky one.. Yeah. We're gonna keep this ticket. You could get three more. But what if those three don't work out? I believe it's my lucky ticket. You're right. How about $20? You still wouldn't do it for 20? Why? I'll do it for 20. There's your ticket, and I will take the $20. But you wouldn't? Why would you do it for 20? I'd do it for 20 because even if my ticket isn't selected for a prize at least I walk away with something. -But you still wouldn't do it for 20? -No. Wow! What is happening? People are acting completely irrational. And, also, I hope this isn't weird that I'm, like, talking into my glasses. Amazing. Out of all these tickets, only a few will be winners. And yet only one person agreed to sell their ticket for a guaranteed profit. Well, as surprising as this seems, we kinda had a feeling people would behave this way. But why? The reason why most people refuse to sell back their tickets or overvalue them is due to something scientists call the endowment effect. It works like this. When you purchase something, it becomes yours. To your brain, the fact that something is yours and no one else's gives it a special kind of power, and it becomes more valuable than what you paid for it. Perhaps you've experienced this, too, like when your parents bought you your favorite teddy bear or your lucky jacket. Nice jacket. Suddenly, that item is no longer worth just the value they paid for it. Instead, it's yours and it's priceless. And while these tickets, aren't your priceless Bear Bear, they did become more special than a piece of paper worth five dollars because our participants paid for them. In other words, they became endowed with more value. Which caused people to make the irrational decision to hold onto their tickets. And if you're wondering which one of these people won the raffle, none of them did. Guess they should've sold me their tickets. It just goes to show, while your brain is still 30 times more powerful than the best supercomputer, you can still be prone to irrational thinking. But don't worry. We'll show you how to take back control. Trust me. I'm positive. ♪ Photo positive. ♪ We've gathered a few volunteers to play a simple game. All they have to do is count the number of photos inside this magazine. Get it right, and they win a quick 20 bucks. Sounds easy enough, right? The catch, they'll only have ten seconds to do it. Ten seconds? So do you think winning this game is possible or impossible? I think it's possible. It's impossible. It is impossible to count all these photos. It's entirely possible. Looks like a pretty even split on the answers. -Now let's see how they did. -Go. Time's up! Aggghh. So, do you think anyone was able to count all the photos in time? -Should I give you my answer? -Not yet, because first, you're going to try this game at home. Remember, try to count all of the photos in under ten seconds. Think you can do it? And go! Wow. We only got through a few pages, and there's so many to go. But we think some of you might have the correct answer anyway. Let's see what our volunteers said. -Forty-eight. -More like 35. There are 48 pictures. -And time is up. -Seven. Oh, no! I'm not even halfway through. So, what was your answer? Well, if you said 48, congratulations! You're right! And for those of you who didn't get it, you may be wondering why some of these people were able to do it and others not so much. Well, it has everything to do with the question at the beginning of this game. Is it going to be possible or impossible to count the number of photos? It's impossible. It think it's possible. It is impossible to count all these photos. It's entirely possible. Wow. The people who had a positive attitude going in all came up with the correct answer, while the people with the negative attitude came up short. So how could your attitude help you win this challenge? Well, obviously, you can't count all these photos in ten seconds. But thinking positive may have helped you spot this. "Stop counting. There are 48 pictures." That's right! There's a cheat code hidden right in plain sight. So why did only some of our volunteers see it? In this experiment the ones that went in with a positive outlook despite it being an impossible task, left their minds open enough to see the helpful hint that we provided. On the other hand, the people who went in with a defeatist attitude missed the answer. It was literally right in front of their face. So, the lesson is, if you tell yourself you can't do something, chances are you'll be right. It was possible. It really was, but... I went about it the wrong way. The power of positive thinking. Positive thinking doesn't just help you navigate the world around you. There are benefits to thinking positive inside of you, as well. Benefits associated with positive thinking include boosting your health and wellness, helping you harness more brainpower, even increasing your memory, all of which would help if you had a test coming up, or if you found yourself in the hot seat on a wacky new game show. [chanting] Think or swim! Think or swim! Please, you've got to help me. -Beat it. -No, I need an answer. For the grand prize [slowed down speech] do you have an answer, Jeff? I'm afraid I don't know it. [choir sings] Oh, Jeffrey, I'm sorry. The correct answer to the question, "What Grammy Award-winning Michael Jackson song rhymes with 'eat it'?" is "Beat It." I can't believe it. You were right. Ya think? Now I eat it? Ow I dunno. They're like... rarr rirr rirrr vyoom vyoooom! Like... reeeaaarr! They don't make that noise, but, you know... I'm afraid I don't know it. -You want me to go again? -Yeah, one more time.
