You okay? Yeah... Check for a fever? Okay. What about breakfast? Well… - Bread? - There's no bread. - What? - There's no bread. - No? - Nope. Not even in the freezer? There's one piece. - Good. - You want it? Sure. And fruit. Good, thanks. Okay. How 'bout sausage? Yeah, sure. Any fever? A cold can do that. Like, make you nauseous. Yeah. It's that bad? Yeah. Lemme cook. Thanks. - Morning. - Hey. It came. The male figures each represent a different vice. Extravagance and Envy tear their hair. Vanity is a peacock. Yumi, take a look. Which font looks good for the assignment? I wonder... The first one? Show me. - The fourth one. - Totally. It's a cool font. Xants is so dope. Oh? I don't know it. You're kidding. Seriously. It was huge news when they reissued it. Right? Yeah. They call it a "Bauhaus treasure." I've never heard of it. Really? Xants is pretty popular among designers now. [Search: Zants font] Just my opinion. I'm into Bauhaus, so that's nothing new. But Xants looks so dope when you use it for text. - Really? - Totally. - Oh! Hiya. - You're calling me? Yep. Where's Ikeda? She already left. Eri, too? She didn't come today. Found it. Thanks. Sure. You look pale. Really? I don't feel good. Don't hide stuff. It's nothing. - Like before. - No, not that. No way. You barfed then... - I sure did. This morning, too. - Today? - Yep, yep. - You got a cold? I guess... If you're sick, I bet you're not hungry. I don't mind tagging along. Where ya gonna eat? Let's see... - What's the special? - Today, it's bagel sandwiches. - Manager! - What? A cockroach? It's a spider. - Oh, good. - Why say that? - Cuz it's just a spider. - What?! Spiders are better than cockroaches. - I prefer cockroaches. - No... Spiders have got hair. Cockroaches fly. - Kill 'em, then. - Gross. I don't mind. For real? Just kill 'em. But people say not to kill spiders. At least, in Japanese culture... Music from here? From here? Yeah. - See ya. - Bye. You're too busy for a drink, right? They're not having rehearsal tomorrow, so I can. Can what? You know, drink. Do you have a moment? Yeah. That line's the cue for the music? - Is that a cut-in? - The last one, yeah. What was the line? The cue is... Let's see… Here. Yeah, okay. And... Cheers, guys. Are we drinking? I've got my gig now. You rehearse with them tomorrow? Not tomorrow. - Hi. - Hey. A regular gave me this. What? Paul Smith. What? A key case. That's so nice. Yeah. I didn't hear back, so I made food. I ate at the bar. I see. But I'll have some. Okay. Actually... Don't get mad, okay? What? Don't get mad. Well... okay... - Of course, I won't. - You get mad easily. Not over something like this. Wait... what? So you're... Yeah. Now... The thing is... Well... you see... Okay. What is it? What's wrong? There's nothing "wrong"...of course. First of all... congratulations on your pregnancy. Not "congratulations." That sounds strange. I gotta tell you something. So, I'm gonna say it now. Well... The baby... We just don't know... What'cha mean? I mean... I mean, who's the parent. We don't know. It could've happened after we broke up. Wow... I guess so. I told him. I told him not inside. But anyhow, he did… Now, I'm all confused. - Look over there! Look! - The ocean... - Oh, the ocean! - So beautiful. Hey, look! Carp! They even have carp. Isn't that amazing? - There're so many. - Adorable. Anybody got some food? A perfect place to lose my V-card. Keep it down. Perfect for a date, right? My folks take me to places like this. I don't wanna be thinking of them. - That would suck. - Like, totally... - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. - Guys. - Oh! Which floor? Room 712. So seventh floor? Pretty high. - Gosh! - Oh, wow. - Oh, my God! This is amazing! - So gorgeous. - Best hotel ever! - Amazing. Wait! This is awesome. You see that? - What? Wait a minute... - The bath? Wait! What the hell are you doing? What the hell? Seriously. - Not in your clothes. - That's gross. - What? - What'cha mean "what"? That's not a swimsuit. Come on. - She's lost it. - Totally. She's a total wacko, right? - Yes, we got a wacko here. - Right here. You're chuggin'. This is sick! You think they're our age? I guess. They're pumped. Young and dumb. Pretty pathetic. - They're chugging. - I bet they're just legal. Pathetic. She's probably still a virgin. Don't hate virgins. That's why I hate you. Oh, stop it, will you? It's time you grew up. - Oh, you cut it? - Yep. Most guys are after innocent girls, right? Yeah. But if the guy's a virgin too, you get worried. Definitely. We were both cherry. - But, no manwhores, okay? - No way! You two need dudes who know what they're doing, just not manwhores. I gotta catch up. You think some guys prefer sluts? Skilled in battle! I need a guy at my level. What about Masato? - Well, he's a V-boy, too. - A "V-boy!" You won't get back together? - Or, he's not the right one? - What? Can't you tell? He's too pure. Yeah, I get that. Pure, kinda like ivory? He's just too pure. Born with a silver spoon. - A little, rich boy. - I see. - That's it. - Rich boys are fine. My folks pay my rent, too, though. A rich V-boy and V-girl. Perfect together. I pay rent from my student loan. A model student! - Why are you here? - The place is packed. Okay. This is perfect. Here. Since your birthday is coming soon. What's this? You shouldn't. It's perfect timing. Can I sit there? Oh, sure. - You can open it. - I'll open later. Open them now. I got you two gifts. If you say so. It's gonna look great on you. Thanks. - Put it on, will you? - Here? Yep. Want me to? Lemme do it myself. You sure? I knew it. What's this? It's a memory book from when we were dating. I see… You made it... - Masato? - Yeah, him. - What did he give you? - It's pretty hilarious. - What? - Two presents. - Yumi, do you design fliers? - What? Can you design fliers for us? Well, I've done them before. The inter-university drama club... We need fliers for our next play. - Oh. - Sure, what kind? Can I mention your name? - Yep. - Okay. You keep quiet. What kind? And why me? I showed them your designs. Now they're interested. It's not some mistake? Of course not, I guess. You gotta help me, Usui. What? How much? Stop! I'm no pro. Of course, we'll pay. You don't have to. - If I help, I get paid. - Right? So, this is Naoya. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - We already ordered, so... - I'll have coffee. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Yes? - One coffee, please. - Okay. The test came back positive. All right. Are you here alone? Well... Yes. All right. And you aren't sure who the father is? I'm not, like, 100% certain. Okay. I know it's gotta be hard for you to talk about this. But how many possible men are we talking about? Two guys. Two, okay. Is it possible to contact them? Well, maybe not. Are you late for rehearsal? Well, if I leave now… I'll just make it. When you get home, let's talk about the future and stuff. Okay. Can you give me some time? I can't give you an answer tonight. I need time to think. Sure. Can I meet the other guy? What for? I just wanna. I dunno. I don't think so. How shall we do this? Trade contacts? - Oh, right. - Okay. Watch our DVDs, okay? Yes, for reference. Thanks... I'll study your style. The design will reflect that, right? Yeah, it totally will. Excuse me a minute. Sure. I sent a sticker. Yes, I got it. There she is. Hey. Still working? Yep. - Nearly done? - Not yet. - Did you eat? - No, lemme join. - Can you leave now? - Yep. Let's search, dude. This place looks nice. - They're closed today. - Oh, yeah. How 'bout this one? Looks good! - Want something? - No, I'm leaving. Creep! Don't make a scene. What a dork. - I like this one. - Oh, I'm glad. You see? I can't explain why, but it's good. You agree, right? Among the five, this one best matches your Club's mood. "Company," not "Club." The DVD inspired me. Which would you choose? I'd choose... the same one. That would be my first choice. And this, my second. This one? Let's go with it. I like this, too. Yes, okay. Thank you. Can you touch it up? - Yes. - Can I keep this? Of course. Naoya, do you see a lot of theater? If it's people I know, I might see what they're up to. That's cool. Theater's not your thing... It's true, I'm sorry. You might get bored tonight. But it sounds interesting. Two, please. That'll be 7,600 yen. - Here. - Don't. I invited you. Thank you. Here's 7,000... - And 600 yen. - Yes, perfect. Here you are. Enjoy the play. Thank you. It's open seating. Thank you. Not especially thrilling. Thank you for today. Well, I guess... What now? Whatever is fine for me, if you have time... Do you? Then, grab dinner? Okay. Spit it out! - No, I just... - Just say it. - I mean... - Be honest. It was kinda hard. See? I knew it! I mean... I got what you mean. It was too hard for me. - You were just bored. - Well... You can say you were bored. What about you? I'm used to stuff like that. My plays are different. I see. You wanna go into theater after you graduate? I guess. That's my plan. Will you join a company? I'm not sure. I'd rather start my own. - Naoya as "Company Director"... - In my dreams. That's really cool. What about your current company? I didn't start it. It's a university theater with a long history. I want a grown-up audience. People who appreciate art. - I see. - You know... Hello? Hey. I... It's just... Sorry, I didn't pick up. What's up? It's just... My mom... My mom passed away. I just got a phone call saying she's passed away. Sorry to bother. I just needed to hear your voice, Usui. No, you didn't bother me… Just between you and me... I wanna write stuff, too. Oh, you do? That's what you wanted to talk about? Actually, yeah. I think I'd be good behind the scenes, too. Where I'm guest performing... Hagino started out on stage, too. I won't quit acting, though. - I know. - Right. So, you have something you wanna write about? I already did. - Wow. Already? - Yep. Lemme send you the draft. - Wait, I'll print it out. - Okay. Could you read it? Right now? Not now. Later is totally cool. - Sure, sure. - Thanks. I'll go print it out. You're early. I caught an earlier train. Oh, that's good. Is she home? Yeah, she's sleeping there. - Buckle up. - Oh. Look, Yumi's come home. I'm home. She was doing fine at the hospital. Yeah. She was eating well. But the veins in her brain... Yeah. Are you eating properly? I am. But you've lost weight, no? I'm eating okay. You should worry about yourself. Yeah. I can cook for myself. I do it all the time. Really? That's impressive. How's university? It's fine, I guess. I design fliers and stuff. And I get paid. So, it's a job? Wow. Sounds like a job. Did you hear that? I just started. Yumi's got a job. And a boyfriend? I wish I could find one. Let me thank you for your condolences at the passing of my late wife, Hiroko. This now concludes the wake, all thanks to you. I'm sure my late wife is very happy now. Hello? Hi. Why are you calling? Well... I haven't heard anything from you since that message about going home. So I got worried. Oh, yeah... Don't worry. Sorry about that. We were supposed to talk. Yeah. But you asked me to wait. That's true. But it's been three days. And I was ready to talk today. But you're not here. Okay. I'm busy right now. But I'll get back within a week. That's a long trip. Did you tell your parents? No, I haven't. Look, I really have to go. I'll call you back. Sorry. Bye. I'm happy to stay longer. But you go back to work today... Yep. I've spent a lot of money. And I gotta earn your rent. Sorry. I'm joking. I think you'll need help. Don't worry about me. Of course, I do. You're my dad. Take care of yourself first. Earn enough to pay your rent with that design thing. Hey. Huh? You told me no vacuuming at night. It's the first time in days. I guess you were slacking... I've been busy. Is it noisy? I'll stop. Sakamoto's saying he wants to write. - Actually, he already did. - Really? I was like, "Already?" Do a read-through with me. Sure. I'm sending you his play. Okay. Look... Huh? Let's have it. What? Let's have the baby. Why? The baby could be mine. Right. So having it... That's the better choice. But, we don't know. What? The dad. Yeah, but still... It could be mine. It probably is, right? I'll do what I need to do. Find a real job... Yeah, I'll get a decent job. So, that's that. What'cha think? Like, I'm ready, you know. Okay. Me, too. Good. Are you feeling okay? Yep. I read the male parts. You read the female parts. Okay. Wanna read it all first? Yep. Lemme know when you're ready. Crying already? You're feeling moved? - Yeah. - Come on. You only just started reading. Tears of joy? Recently, you know... I over-identify with people and stuff... I don't like it. I don't know why. But, I do. I should meet your parents, right? Take me somewhere. Huh? Take me somewhere. Are you well enough for that? Yep, for now. Okay. Where do ya wanna go? Where... Well... Let's do a DNA test. Huh? Why don't we do that before I meet your parents? Well, I don't want to. It can wait, but keep it in mind. I want one. - Look who's here! - Been a while. - Why are you here? - I just came. You're the only decent theater, Hagino. - Did you tell Sakamoto? - No, I didn't. - Why not? - Why do that? He's busy. I'll just pay. We could've comped you. - Are there seats? - Sure, thanks. How's Sakamoto doing? See for yourself. My star had better do good. - Talk later... - Thanks. Two, please. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Let's go outside. I'm sleepy. Go ahead. Okay. I seriously don't get it. You should've just lost it. - What's wrong with you? - Totally. What? You don't have to do everything in order. But, we aren't a couple. Everyone does a test fuck first. I mean that's just normal. So, you like him? I think he's handsome. So? You like his looks? - I do. - Fess up... It's more than that. I like having him over. What the hell? Just date him then. But maybe... he'll pull back. If that's the case, just forget him. Actually, we're gonna take a trip. - There's your chance! - What? That's the plan. Then, it's all gonna happen. You're almost a couple. I hope so. - Can I mention something? - What? I've been wanting to tell you all. I got a boyfriend. - What? - Congrats! You found the one? He's a virgin, though. - You haven't done it? - No, we haven't. The perfect guy? He almost meets all my conditions. He gives me rides... Stop, stop. Huh? - I can feel your thing. - I know you can. Why? Cuz I'm ready for that. Stop, stop... Why stop? What? We aren't a couple yet. But, we're gonna take a trip. I like hot springs. And you kiss me? Kissing is okay. Yumi, Yumi... What's up? - You just ignored me. - No, I didn't. Well, anyway, I heard you're making fliers. Yeah, I did... - I saw them. - Thanks. You're amazing. I'm not, but thanks. For that... Here. What? It's kinda scary. To celebrate the flier. Your first job. You shouldn't have. We gotta celebrate. It's nothing special. Just take it. How can I? There's nothing to celebrate. It's some fancy face lotion. - Thanks. - Sure. How about dinner, too? Well... What do you want to eat? I can never predict what I'll want to eat. Sorry, I gotta go. - Hey, Mom. - What? You're back? I forgot my face lotion. You're going somewhere? Yes, just for a bit. Where to? - The hospital. - What? I'm staying overnight. Why? For some routine checks. Nothing serious. I see. Are you feeling sick? No. They're just doing tests. Don't worry. Okay. Take care. Thanks. Hey. Need drinks or something? How long is the trip? It's a surprise. How much for the car? Let's see... Just gimme 3,000 yen. It's pretty cheap. Given the size, yes. But it cost more. Let's split it, then. Nope. 3,000 yen is fine. - You sure? - Yep. It's on the seventh floor, Room 712. Enjoy. Let's go. My favorite hotel. Is that so? Looks great. - You see? - Wow, amazing. It's pretty popular. Really? Isn't it great? I'll cook next time. Anything you don't eat? No. Except for peas. You can't eat peas? I'll make you like them. Seriously, I can't. I'll mask the flavor. Listen, I really can't. Why? I just can't. - What's the matter with peas? - Their existence. Existence? You can't mask peas. You really hate them? Yep. They make no sense. Help! You haven't moved? I can't move. Why not? Your sperm is on my back. I wiped it. Not completely. The bed'll get dirty. Who cares? Wipe it all off. C'mon! Just do it. Yeah, yeah. There was blood on my dick. I told you to use a condom. I don't use them, on principle. You got me pregnant. No, I didn't. - You did. - I didn't. Let's wash your back. - I'm pregnant. - No, you aren't. You took my virginity, but we aren't a couple. About that... Let's get in the bath. Yeah. - He's been stalking me. - He's hounding you. - His gifts are scary, too. - Like what? A face lotion I'd never use. What? Poor Masato. - Checking out, sir? - Yes. One moment, please. I wanted to explore the town. I know, right? It's fun to explore. But resorts aren't like that. It was perfect, then. Yes, all set. Thank you for staying at our hotel. Please take care. You're back. Hey. See? I asked how you are. Yeah. You should've said no. Kay. What? I was feeling okay. Even so, you should've told me when your condition changed. Yeah. Right? You're a grown-up. If something's wrong, you gotta handle it. Morning sickness is normal. Embarrass you. What? I didn't mean to embarrass you. That's not the point. It's how you handle things. The nausea started during the play. I couldn't help it, okay? I was okay in the morning. That's why I asked you, remember? I asked if you were well enough, given everything. Who'd anticipate nausea? It's about probabilities. Can't you see? You could've predicted the nausea. That's more normal, isn't it? No. People have to predict what's coming. But, I see you don't. You're gonna have to. Very well, sorry! I will. I will predict stuff. Why are you reacting like that? I said sorry. I'm dizzy right now. Why do I still bleed during sex? I wonder why. - Does it hurt? - No. I'm used to it. That's weird. - Take the pill. - Why? That'll stop irregular periods. You wear a condom. - For birth control. - Jeez. Just kidding. - Jeez! - Just kidding. If we're a couple, I might. Okay. Seriously though, I wanna spend more time with you. Okay. - I wanna see your place. - Oh... Why not? - I didn't say you can't. - Then, why? Well... It's just... - I was gonna tell you. - Don't! - Why? - I hate bad news. What? You're so loud. Stop that. Just stop it. Listen to me, okay? Listen... Listen to me. Yumi, I get it. Just listen. Listen to me. Stop pinching me. I get it, okay? Just listen to me. That hurts, stop. I said stop! Just kidding. Seriously... I have a roommate. And she's my ex. See? There's the bad news. No, listen. We lived together, but then we broke up. I haven't moved out yet. That's the reason. Living with an ex... We aren't intimate anymore. We're just roommates. When did you break up? A while back. Why stay there? Are you two-timing me? I'm not. You just bridge... from one girl to the next. No, I've been busy with the next play. So... Oh? Now, confess your love! - C'mon! - You wanna date? - Why would I? - Don't hide your love. I've never said that. Is that all? There're some bags left. Okay. I can ship them later. No, I'll be fine. I can help. We can finish it off. No, it's okay. Just throw the rest. - Your alarm. - Okay. What sounds good for dinner? I already ate. Sorry. Really? Did you just sigh? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. Sorry, not on purpose. If you're in bed with nausea, why'd I think you want dinner? It's just... I always make dinner, thinking what time you'll get home. But you ate without even asking me. That stressed me out. Wait, did I ever ask for that? What? I never asked you to make dinner based on my schedule. You did that on your own. And I'm grateful. But don't start blaming me. - You never asked... - I'm grateful. I really am. And? You never asked me. But it's good to eat food when it's warm. Right, I said I'm grateful. And? "And"? You're upset over your own choices. If there's other stuff like that, you should sort it out now. You never compliment my cooking unless I ask. That's not true. I praise it. Anything else? You leave your peas. I told you, I can't eat them. Cucumbers, too. So what? What's your point? I'm answering. And I've cooked for you. I told you I can't eat peas. I can't stand the taste. Try, at least. I masked the flavor. It doesn't matter. I just can't. You don't even try. Why this obsession with peas? It began right after we met. I'm helping you get over it. What's the point of that? Forcing them on me isn't gonna make me able to eat them. - Maybe you can. - I can't. You never know. What if I only cooked peas? I'd have to stop you. Nope. That's just harassment. Fine, don't eat them. I'll be starving. Then, eat them. Even if I'm starving, I can't. You want me to sort this out or not? Oh, okay... Fine. All right, I get it. Okay. I'm sorry I ate alone. It was my fault. But I won't eat peas. What time shall we eat? Around eight. Okay. - I'm off. - See you. I was doing what you said, Usui. Yeah, but just one night, right? Does he know you're not single? He knows I have a boyfriend. So it was a one-off? A repeater? Yep. I assumed it was your boyfriend. Here she comes. - Hey. - She has news. - My phone... - Forget that. Go ahead. - I did it. - The big deed? We all passed the step. Yes, but she has a surprise. What? It wasn't with my boyfriend. What? What about him? Still a virgin. And the guy has a girlfriend. Wait, how did it happen? I was just trying to follow Usui's advice. I wanted a guy with experience. - You stole someone's guy? - I borrowed! We still have our partners. You stole a guy, too, and made him move out. I did not. Yes, you did. They were broken up by then. Romance usually means stealing love. Hi. Perfect timing. Can we talk? What is it? What's that mean? Let's stop seeing each other. Why? You know why. You just moved in. Why are you suddenly leaving? Yeah... It's best for both our sakes. You just moved in... I was gonna move out of there anyway. You got tired of me? What? Tired having sex with me? Come on. Why say that? Then, why? For our sakes, I decided. I'm asking you why. Why? What's wrong? He dumped me. What? He dumped me. What's going on? You okay? Oh... What? Hey, you okay? Oh, what's this? Lemme get a towel and... Is this 'cuz he dumped you? Here. Here. Wait... There she is. Which table? Over there? - We seat ourselves? - Is it okay? We're not always available, so I recommended this. I get it. This will keep her busy. I'm harsh on my friends. Find her a guy. A no-nonsense approach. Here are your drinks. How's working life? I'm on duty now, sorry. I keep breaking stuff. My boss isn't happy. Just now, your tray was like… - It wasn't! - Yes, it was. Right? Hello? Hey. What're you up to? Another lonely-hearts call? Yeah. I'm with my boyfriend. Gotta go. What? - That's you, right? - No. Says who? Everybody. You're definitely wrong. - Hey. - Hi. - Hello. - Been a while. She's a cutie! - You're lucky. - Shut up. - You agree? - Shut up. - Nice to see you again. - Hey. - You know him? - Usui's ex. - Can I say that? - Sure. What're you having? - A beer. - Beer. - Me too. - Yep. - Three beers. - Okay. The same direction? That way? Yep. Walking distance. We're neighbors. - Thanks. - Sure. - Thank you for treating us. - Thanks. Wait, what're you carrying? It was in front of the register. Candies? Let's return them. I don't want them! - Return them. - Seriously... Just a sec. What? Come on, you asked us to wait. Oh, that's right. Where to, next? You're too drunk. No way! We can't just leave Yumi here? - You should go home. - I'm not drunk! You are. What's Yumi gonna do? Let's return them, okay? Okey-dokey. - Go on. - Yeah, yeah. I'm taking you home. Seriously, I'm okay. You don't have to do that. We go that way. - Okay. - Bye. - Take care. - Yep! All right. I got it. I'm sorry, okay? Sorry about that. You hear me? I said sorry! Calm down. It's dangerous. Why mention your ex? You asked me. I didn't ask for details. Okay. Just stop for now. Who did I have the abortion for? Who paid for that? Whose money was it? Don't say that. It was our choice. Look, I broke up with her to take responsibility. You do that, and it's over. We'll be done with. Got it? I'll have to fight back. That's a bad idea. Hey! Seriously, stop. Stop it. I'm gonna cum inside. - Don't! - You're on the pill. I saw them. I'm not taking it now. You let your ex do it. I bet you loved it. No, I didn't. Don't do that. Stop. I can't believe you did that. But you're on the pill. I told you I stopped. But, I saw your pills. I stopped taking them after we broke up. Really? The worst thing ever. You're overreacting. Your apartment's pretty cool. Just get out. The probability is really low. Get out! If we get like this, I can't take it anymore. Yeah. This is different. We're not just arguing over the abortion. You blow up over every tiny thing. I can't take responsibility much longer. It's getting beyond me. Beyond you? Unless you change. And stop being needy. Are you serious? Want something? - Treating me? - Yep. Thanks. You're using eye drops today. My eyes hurt. Cuz you were writing on your laptop all night, I bet... Yeah... A playwright needs a laptop. What laptop you got? - Hey. Long time no see. - I guess so. What's up? You're smoking now? - Yep. - What happened? My heart got broken. Oh, I see. - You could've told me. - That's okay. I'm happy to listen. Smoking's bad for your health... But, I still do. I don't actually enjoy it. I didn't know you were seeing someone. Yep. Heartbroken...? If I were him, I'd never dump you. - What happened? - That's okay. I don't mind listening. How about a drink today? - To "celebrate" your heartbreak? - Just forget it. No, no, let's have something you like. I'll take you to a fancy restaurant. You know, next time... How about you choose me? Did it work? Yep, I deleted it. Gosh, I have so many assignments I have to finish. I'm not gonna help you. I know that. Me, neither. Wanna hear something hot? Right when we're busy? Nope. It's about Masato. Go ahead. I told him I was heartbroken, and he said, "Choose me." Jeez. Why? Maybe no reason. Yep. That's just Masato. It's so him. What about the new guy? Nothing happened. The day before yesterday. Sorry, I know it's painful to talk about. But I have to ask. How much time elapsed between your last period and the sex? About a week. Okay. I see. You should take the morning-after pill as soon as possible, right? Yes, but the clinic was closed. Right. But you could've visited ER. You got your appetite back? The nausea is gone. I learned we can do a DNA test from the seventh week. That must be about now. Huh? I didn't agree to that. But... I can't meet the other guy, right? Then, a test makes sense. Why? Having clarity would be healthy. So we're not doubting our own child. Let's just raise the kid, believing that it's ours. But that's... That's... Never mind. What's with you? Just be upfront. I mean, that's not based on facts. Without the test, we never have to know if that's true or not. That's my point. Facts matter to me. If the baby's not mine, I'll still accept it. That was my decision. Why bother when we can just believe the baby is ours? Well... Okay. I don't wanna argue about this. Look, I've been trying to make up with you. I let it go about dinner. Why are you reacting like that? I told you I don't want the test. First, just listen to me. It's okay you feel that way. But, when you're like that, things get weird between us. Doesn't it feel weird now? Weird, or... At least, that's how I feel. So what's our plan? Why keep bringing up the test? I won't do it. Okay... Why are you against it? Why so desperate to know? What? Did I ever say I was? That's how I sound to you? Okay, whatever. Yes, I'm desperate. Is that so? I'm worried 'cuz this kid could be some other guy's. I don't wanna hear that. Even so, I'm still trying to be with you. I wanna believe the baby's mine. That's my struggle. What's wrong with that? - Hey! Listen to me! - I feel sick. You said the nausea was gone. You told me to predict it. So, you're going to be sick? You got it. Look... You think I don't have worries? I don't want to get a normal job. I have my own dream, you know. But I'll be a dad. And worse, the baby might be some other guy's. You're not the only one crying. What about me in all this? You get to whine all you want. How... How can you say that? Huh? That's a terrible thing to say. Who cares how I say it? That's not my point. I don't wanna... Don't wanna what? I don't wanna be a mom, not knowing who the dad is. Just come out and talk. Just come out, okay? I need to see you talk. Ignoring me is the worst thing. You're breaking the door. Then open it. Stop. It's gonna break. Then, come out. What is this? Are you trying to scare me? What? You can't just force me. I just wanna talk. You don't wanna be a dad? You don't wanna be a dad. You asshole. Asshole. Asshole. Asshole… Speak... Speak... Yes? Which one you want? Why are we meeting again? You're the best to be with. Just tell me. I just did. You think I'll buy that? Yep. I hate you. So selfish... You hate me? I've hated that part. It's fun. You sound like an idiot. - You idiot. - I'm chill. Totally chill. No, you sounded like an idiot. Mind if I scream? - Go ahead. - Really? - Sure. - I really will. - Okay. - I mean it. Don't scare me! Keep it down. Jeez. You were seriously loud. You suggested it. Unbelievable. You're just crazy. I can't believe it. - Surprised? - I am. How about a happy surprise story? Lemme tell you. It was in third grade, and I was with my cousins. We were digging sand at the beach. So, I was digging like this. Then this finger... See this finger. Right under my nail, there was this spiny fish. What? A spiny fish... Some sharp part of it was lodged right there. - And it hurt. - Yeah. Where're you going? Back home. Wait. I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah... I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax. I wasn't trying to scare you. Sorry. Huh? I... I can't. You can't what? Ignoring me doesn't help. You don't wanna be a dad, right? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Stop. - You said that. - That's not true. It's too late. You can't take it back. I didn't say that. You did. I didn't. I didn't. Why'd you suggest we have it? You don't wanna be a dad to some other guy's kid. I shouldn't have said that. I really shouldn't have. But you said kinda the same thing. Wait, what? So it's me? I'm to blame? No, I'm not saying that. I feel the same, you see? I was totally serious... Right? I get it. I get it. We both just said that, right? I get it. I know I said something wrong. I know, but... I was trying to make rules for us, and I went too far. Rules? I make our meals. I do our laundry... I can't believe this. I'll fix that. I will. I was trying to think what's be best for us. Let's break up. Are you serious? Let's break up. What about the kid? I know... Think about it. Can you do it alone? Don't tell me you're gonna abort the kid. How can you possibly ask me that? That's why you'll be a dad? For me not to abort? That's a terrible thing to say. You don't love me? I do. I do love you. - I love you, too. - Can't you see that? I waited for you. After you returned the key without giving me a reason. Then, why sleep with some other guy? For god's sake. Stop hitting stuff. I really am sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean I don't wanna be a dad. I... I'll tell my dad. I'll have the baby, and then... I'll just handle it. So, get on with your life. Do what you want in theater. You won't be a dad. Good for you. Well, it's true. I had plans for my future. No one would think I'm choosing an easy path. So my partner will suffer. I get it. Okay, I get it. You don't wanna be a dad. It's very clear to me now. Look, if only you did the test... Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? Here we go. Okay. It's like getting married. Bye. Okay. Directed by Takuya Kato Let's eat. Grown Ups
