Call it in the air, heads or tails. What? Heads or tails? Call it. Heads. Heads. Again. Heads. Again. Tails. Tails it is. - Again. - Tails. Heads. Tails. Heads. I can't believe this. - Again. - Tails. Heads. Heads. That's ten for ten. Roy, what's going on? He called Bernie. Now, I'm gonna take you home and feed you dinner instead of booking you as a runaway. I'm not psychic. I can't tell the future or see things that are happening somewhere else or talk to people who have died. It isn't anything fancy like esp. I'm just lucky. I didn't run away, either. I just didn't tell Bernie where I was going. This is the final boarding call for bus 227 departing to yreka. All passengers should be boarding at this time. This is a final boarding call for bus 227 departing to yreka. All passengers should be boarding at this time. I need somebody to buy me a ticket. I've got the money. Then why don't you buy your own ticket? You have to be 15 or older to ride the bus. Where are you looking to get to? - Liberty. - I hear ya. It's in New York. Please, I have to get there. Okay. Jeez Louise, what did you do, Rob a piggy bank? Whoa! Maybe a casino? I didn't Rob anybody. I'm just lucky. We are now boarding bus 432, destination Pittsburgh, with stops in salt lake city. All right, single file. Put your bags right over there. Have your tickets ready. Thank you. Excuse me. Would you like some help with your kittens? Well, how sweet. Tickets, please. Thank you, thank you. - Ticket, young lady. - Here you go. I've got the kittens, grammy. But if I'm going to tell you this story, I should probably start earlier than this. Maybe not quite that far back. We should probably just go back a few days, before I knew anything about that baby, or about Liberty, New York, or hill house, or that very strange word, "soof." I think it was Wednesday. "Bosom of the air"? - How dumb can you get? - Dumb? I'm gonna get far, far away from you, before a bolt of literary lightning comes blasting through the ceiling. How can the air have a bosom? Have I not taught you about personification, young lady? Not to mention simile, metaphor? - Symbolism? - Yeah, but what's the point if you can't understand what anyone's talking about? Precious, Heidi and I are having school right now. We'll come see your picture in a minute. Okay. Read it aloud. - Why? - Trust me, read it. "So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called..." ♪ done, done, done! ♪ Coming, mama! What do you want to start with tomorrow? What are my choices? Carbon cycle, viking saga or the algebra chapter we've been working on. How about the carbon cycle, then lunch, - then the vikings. - You got it, Helga. Here we are, precious. - Hey, mama. - Heidi, done! Pretty picture. Blue. Don't worry. It was almost empty. That's okay, mama. See? Good as new. Kiss, huggy. Kiss, hug. Kiss. Wilinskys are cat people, so we shouldn't have any trouble finding homes for these little ones. Poor babies, it's the first time they've been away from their mother. Where are you headed? - Liberty, New York. - Well, I'm going to Pittsburgh. Wilinsky family reunion. - There are gonna be 52 of US this year. - That's nice. You realize what that means? 52 wilinskys? You could put a wilinsky in every state and have two left over. Can you believe it? Seven of US are alices. It's a wilinsky tradition. If your first-born is a girl, she's an automatic Alice. And you want to hear something strange? Every one of those alices was born in October. October wilinskys, how about that? When's your birthday? February. The 12th, we think. We think. Well, that's funny. Is it the 12th or isn't it? Yes, it's the 12th. Well, I got the first of the October wilinsky birthdays. Mine's October third, and then comes cousin Alice, hers is on the fifth. And then cousin Alice... I didn't blame Alice for thinking it was strange that I didn't know when my own birthday was. She was right. It was strange, just like my name. Heidi it. What kind of a last name is that for a person, "it"? The funny thing is, until a few days ago, it hadn't even occurred to me to wonder about my name. And to think, it all started with a penny. Hot! Hot, hot. - Do you think we can fix it, Bernie? - I don't know. We'd have to fix it or do without. It's a turbolux... model 84721, double a. And it looks like... What's funny? Sir, I know you're not running a museum. I simply asked if you carry the part. Wonderful. Do you take credit cards over the phone? Great. Well... How soon could you send me the part? Bring it? No, no, no. I need you to send me the part. I see. Spin. Spin. Heidi, you know that money doesn't grow on trees. - I know. - Turn it. So... As long as you don't abuse your gift, or god forbid, get caught. I don't mind, Bernie. Really. Here, clip. Bernie has agoraphobia. - Apples. - When she first told me about it, I thought she said "angoraphobia." I looked it up in the dictionary and decided she must be afraid of rabbits. What it really means... is that she doesn't go outside, ever. Don't talk to anybody. I won't. Before mama and I came into her life, Bernie lived in the apartment with her father, just the two of them, on the night of his 75th birthday, they went out to a diner for supper. Bernie could go anywhere and everywhere back then. He had a meatloaf sandwich and two slices of yellow cake, but on the way home, he dropped dead of a heart attack. It would've been okay if she had just ended up afraid of meatloaf or yellow cake, or maybe even diners, but she didn't. She ended up afraid of everything. ♪ you drive me crazy with the way that you move ♪ ♪ you really came to play now... ♪ yeah, precious. ♪ You could start a fire with a body like that ♪ ♪ burn the damn place down... ♪ never know where they've been, do you Heidi-ho? - You never know. - You never know.

There you go. Thank you. Heidi? Heidi. - Hold my hand. - Heidi! - Bernie! - What's the number of the bus? 73! And we get off at the stop called maynerd. - Out! - Come on, mama. What do you do right before you get to the stop? I pull the string that's right over my head. Out, Heidi! Yes, mama, we're out. And don't talk to anybody but the man at the store. I won't, Bernie. We'll be fine. Out, Heidi, out! Come on, hold my hand. - Pretty, Heidi! - Yes, mama. - Pretty! - She's very pretty. Come on. Hello. - Hello, hello! - Hello, animals. Hello. Hello! This is the bus stop, mama. We're gonna wait here. - Back soon? - Yes, mama. Back soon. The bus is coming. We gotta get on now, okay, mama? Okay? Come on. It's all right. It's all right. Mama, please hurry. Get away from the bus! She's autistic! Mama, mama. It's okay, it's okay! It's okay, mama. Bernie! What in heaven's name happened, Heidi? I don't know! We were waiting for the bus. What? Precious! Precious. Precious! It's okay, precious. - Precious. - It's okay. Done, done! Done, done, done, Heidi! Done, done, done! Done, done, done, Heidi! Little baby. Give her to me. No, no, I got her. Bernie, what's happening? Give her to me. Yeah. That's right. I think your mama's having a memory, sweetie. - Shh. - Of what? That's right, precious. Precious, we're home. Everybody's home. Sweetie? Everybody's home. Mama. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. What is it, mama? What do you remember? It's okay. What is it? Soof! What? Soof. Until then, mama had only 22 words. But this one, "soof," I knew it was different. I couldn't get it out of my head. That was when Bernie told me we needed to talk. Okay. It was the 19th of February, and I went to that door. Hello? Hi. Are you okay? Was she saying the "done, done, done" thing? Just like tonight. That's how I knew it was a memory. Are you okay? Done, done, done, done, Heidi. - Done, done, done. - Is she okay? Let me hold the baby. Let me hold the baby. I'll hold the baby. Let me hold the baby. - Okay? - Done, done, done! - Done, done... - It's okay, it's okay. - I can hold the baby. - Done, Heidi. - Is this your baby? - Heidi. Can I hold your baby? Yes, yes. There. Okay, okay. I've got her. But she didn't say that word, "soof"? No, I would've remembered that. What do you think it means? Darling, I have no idea. Why didn't you ever tell me about this? - I told you. - No, you didn't. You've always said mama and I were a gift from god, or that's it's just like we just dropped down from the sky, but you never told me what really happened. Why? Because. It was in the past. Don't worry. We'll be there soon. Mama's always had headaches, off and on, sometimes bad ones, but they definitely got worse after her memory, or maybe it was the trip outside and how upset she got. - Keep still, precious. - There's no way to know, really. But I wasn't thinking about that at the time. Then what happened? Algebra. No, tell me again. What happened after she woke up? How many times we gonna go through this, Heidi-ho? Until I can picture in my head. You got me cleaned up and made a diaper out of a tea towel. Bernie, you got me cleaned up and made a diaper. Out of a tea towel, yes. And then I fed you. With the Turkey baster. With a Turkey baster. Perfect girl. That's good? Good? Yes. And then mama woke up. Hey, there. Hi. You were sleeping. Where do you live? Are you okay? Are you okay? Is this your baby? - Heidi. - Is this your baby? - Heidi? - Heidi. Okay, hang on, hang on. Slowly, slowly. Okay, wait a minute. Honey? Do you live next door? You okay? Wait, wait, wait, wait. You know, look, come sit down. Come sit down. Are you hungry? - Back! - Okay. I wanted to follow you. I'd never wanted to go outside so badly, but I just couldn't. My agoraphobia... And I was afraid I'd never see the two of you again. And then you heard me from here, and you followed US into the next apartment, and heard US here. Okay. And you didn't hear anyone else? Just the two of you. I listened all night and all day, and I didn't hear anyone else. That's when I got the screwdriver. Hi. I live in there, next door. Can I hold your baby? Let me hold your baby. Why don't I hold her? I think she might be hungry again. There we are. My goodness. My goodness. Okay, Heidi. You're okay. And we have been together ever since. Now, Heidi. No more questions. I mean it. Do we even know if that's her real name? - Heidi... - Well, do you? I said, no more questions. I just want to know about her name. Why, sweetie? That's been her name for as long as you can remember. Why are you suddenly asking questions about it? Because it isn't a name. What kind of a name is "so b. It"? It's her name. It's from the Bible, right? A blessing or something? Like saying "amen"? "So be it." "A Rose by any other name..." Don't quote Shakespeare at me. I want to know about her name. It's the name she told me, Heidi. If you don't like it, take it up with her mother, not me. Does mama have a mother? Lordy. Does mama have a mother? Everybody's got a mother. Where is she, then? That's another question entirely. - Well, what's the answer? - The answer is I don't know. What was this place like when you first saw it? What? It couldn't have looked like this. So what was it like? Was this desk here? What's gotten into you today? Nothing, it's just... Heidi, you cut it out. Whose paperweight is this? That's yours. Yours and your mama's. No, but whose was it before? I don't know. Heidi, you better calm down. Whose envelopes? I've never used an envelope in my life, Bernie. - Who used these? - Heidi. Heidi, listen, listen. You are asking me questions to which I don't have answers, okay? Do we pay rent? Electric bills, heat? You're always mailing checks for your bills, but do you pay mama's and my bills? Do you? No, I don't. Then who does? I... I honestly don't know. You know what? Maybe you're named for the book. "Heidi." it's a good book. Actually, we should read that book. Maybe you're named for the movie. Shirley temple was in that movie. When I was little, I loved Shirley temple movies. But then who saw the movie? - My grammy? - What difference does it make? A person has a right to know, Bernie. They're not supposed to guess who they are. You know who you are, Heidi, and you have a history, too. Only from when mama and I met you. Whatever happened before that we should be grateful for, because if it hadn't happened, we wouldn't be sitting here having this conversation, would we? Precious. Yes, we spilled that from the drawer. Thank you, mama. Thanks, mama. What's this? That's a... That's a roll of film. You mean like pictures? Yes. Bernie said there was a day when you could get a roll of film developed somewhere on every city block in an hour. Now you have to put it in the mail. And the crowd falls silent. Hey, Heidi. Zander. Well... Not seeing anything out of the ordinary in there, Heidi. Told you. Come on! Kick it hard. You don't suppose I should check the other side, do you? It's here! - Bernie, it's here! - Shh, shh, shh! Your mama's sleeping. Did you peek at these on the way up? No. It's okay if you did. I was going to, but... I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. I mean, what's the worst it could be? Nothing. The worst it would be is if it was nothing. Well, let's just have a look and see what there is. They're like mama, all of them. Maybe it's a hospital, some kind of special home. Who took the pictures? Do you think mama did? I doubt if she could use the camera, sweetie. Then who took them and how did they end up here? Would you look at this? It's mama. - She looks kind of fat. - Or pregnant. With me, you mean? I'd say that's a safe bet. - Heidi? - What? I'm guessing this is your grammy. What? What? Heidi? This isn't mama's, it's my grammy's. She was here! My grammy was here! Come on. Come on... Hasn't she been sleeping for long enough? Come on, be patient. We'll show her the pictures when she wakes up. What else don't we know about? Like what? How much other stuff is in here? Lots. None of it from back then. But we didn't know about the film. Or whose sweater this was. Maybe there's more stuff. For crying in a bucket! - Don't fall. - I'm not going to fall. I just want to look. God. Don't you think that... Heidi, if there was something else up there, I would've seen it when I was dusting. But you didn't find the film, did you? You're cleaning that up. You're cleaning that up. And don't stick your fingers in there. You're gonna cut yourself on something sharp. - Stop it. - Stop what? Stop trying to make me like you. - Like me? - You're afraid of everything, Bernie. You... I am trying to protect you, Heidi. I don't need you to protect me! You're not my mother. We're not even related! Bernie, wait. Bernie... Bernie, I'm sorry. - I didn't mean it how it sounded. - Soof! Soof! Where, mama? Where's soof? - Which picture? - Hello, Heidi. Show me soof, mama. Where? Point to soof. Which picture? - Mama, show me. - Tea, tea. - No tea! - Tea, Heidi. No tea, mama! Mama! Where are you going, mama? Tea, Heidi. I don't want tea, mama. I want you to show me soof! Tea! - Show me soof, mama. - Tea, Heidi. I don't want tea, mama, I want you to show me soof. - Point to soof, mama. - No, tea. Tea! - I don't want tea! - Heidi, stop it! Where is soof, mama? Point to soof. - Kiss. - I don't want a kiss. - Kiss! - Where? Where is soof, mama? You're not ever going to show me, are you? - Are you? - Stop it. Heidi it! That is not my name and it's not a name at all! Sweetie. You okay? Heidi good done. Soof. Somehow I knew it would be mama's most important word. If only I'd known it would be her last. Heidi. Heidi. I know you're up there. I know you can hear me. It's not fair. You're taking advantage of my fear, of my... my handicap. How would you feel if somebody did that do your mama? I don't know the answers to all your questions, darling. I wish I did. I don't know why the landlord never takes your rent. I don't know why the electric company doesn't shut off your lights. People fall through the cracks in this world all the time, Heidi. I guess I just figured you and your mama fell through a luckier crack than most. And... I was afraid to ask too many questions. I was afraid that... If people knew about you and your mama, they might take you away from me. I couldn't bear that, Heidi-ho. What is "soof," Bernie? Bernie! - Bernie! - What? What are you shouting... What are you doing up? - God... - Look. What does that sign say? Hello? Is this hill house in Liberty, New York? Well, do we have some questions for you. Why didn't he call US when he was in? I understand that, but you said you would have him call. Okay? Yes. Thurman hill. Yes, ma'am. We'll be in all day tomorrow. When I say "all day," I mean all day. I'm listening to these songs for the third time. I think they're just gonna keep me on hold till I hang up. Just a little longer, Bernie, please? Long distance isn't cheap, Heidi-ho. Why won't they talk to US? I don't know. I'd like to march into thurman hill's office and sit on the little pissant till he coughs up the information! Done. Precious, I'm sorry. I've just about had it. That's it, Bernie. That's exactly what we're going to do. - Do what? - We have to go there. You and me and mama. And we'll make him tell US about her. - You know I can't do that. - Go out? When's the last time you even tried, Bernie? Maybe your ap's gone and you don't even know it. It's not gone, Heidi. Things don't just go. Colds do. And pimples. How do you know agoraphobia doesn't go too? Maybe it's already gone. Come on, Bernie, please try... for me. Heidi, no! No! You know I can't. Out, done. Done, out! See? Mama wants you to try too. Mama doesn't know what she's talking about. You make mama try. That's why she can open cans and brush her hair. You make me try too, Bernie. Cursive? Remember how I didn't want to learn but you made me try. That's all I'm asking you to do... try. You don't... You don't understand, Heidi. See, if I go out, if I'm outside, - I might... - Nothing will happen, Bernie. Just one step into the hall, that's all you have to do. One step. The first step, like when you taught me the cursive "a." Remember? Around the block, up, down, curl the tail, and on to the next. Around the block, up, down, curl the tail, and on to the next. Up, down. Curl the tail. You can do it, Bernie. Around the block... Up, down, curl the tail, on to the next. Around the block, up, down, around the block, down. Curl the tail... Heidi. And on to the next. Around the block... Up, down. Around the block, up, down, curl the tail... Up, down, curl the tail, on to the next. Around the block, around the block, around the block, up, down, curl the tail, on to the next. Around the block, up, down, curl the tail, on to the next. Around the block, up, down, up, down, on to the next. Around the block, up... up, down. - Curl the tail. Curl the tail. - Around the block. You did it, Bernie, you're out! You did it! You did it. - Aah! - Bernie! Drowning. I'm drowning. I'm... I'm drowning! - Bernie. - I'm drowning. I'm drowning. What's going on up there, Heidi? Zander! Hurry, we need your help! She's not gonna croak, is she? - Come on, help me get her up! - Okay! Heidi, Heidi. Save me. Save me. My god. Aah! I'm drowning! I'm drowning! - Do you want me to call 911? - No, don't call anyone! Is she drunk? 'Cause if that's what it is... - She's not drunk. - It's okay. I won't tell nobody. I'm so sorry, Bernie. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Shh... Shh. Done, done, done. Done, done, done. Reasons I have to go to Liberty. One, because mama was there, and also my grammy. Two, because Bernie can't go. Three, "soof." Back soon, mama. I hope my luck will hold. It had never failed me, but who knew when it would run out? Or when it would decide that I was in way over my head. Bernie had always told me that I should only use my luck for a good reason. One time, mama had run out of headache medicine, and we had to buy more. I knew that was a good reason. But what about wishing you knew the meaning of a word that might not have a meaning? What about wondering why your mama, with her broken brain and brand-new baby, was all alone in the world. What about wanting to know if you have a family out there somewhere? Is that a good enough reason? Is that the best strawberry rhubarb pie you ever tasted in your life or what? You ever taste a flakier crust, Heidi? Wish I could tell you the recipe, but it's a wilinsky family secret. I was planning to take it to the reunion. I don't know what I was thinking. With all the jostling around, it'd be nothing but mush by the time I got it there. Isn't it wonderful? My mother was in the 4-h. She won ribbons for her pies, and then she passed down all her secrets to me because I was her favorite. Heidi's not a name you hear much nowadays. Is it a family name? We've got a tradition in the wilinsky family. If the first-born child is a girl... I know. You told me. October wilinsky, right? -. You come from a big family, too, Heidi? After the way she'd reacted earlier when I told her about my birthday... Yeah. Big. Big. - Big? - Big, big. I was not about to admit I didn't know if I had a big family or not. And my grammy bakes, too. She's the best baker in the whole world. Really? Can she bake a pie? She doesn't really like to bake pies, just cakes. You know, the ones with lots of layers of frosting in between and then the big pink roses on top? We're big cake eaters, my family. Cake, cake, cake. That's all anybody ever thinks about at my house. I was surprised how easy it was. Maybe it was all those stories about October wilinskys that had just pushed me over the edge. And I'm named after the movie. You know, the one with Shirley temple in it? All I know is that once I got started... - Really? - There was no stopping me. - My grammy knows her. - She knows Shirley temple? Personally? Shirley temple's actually the one who taught my grammy how to bake. She is a very good baker. The Shirley temple we're talking about, the movie star, that's the one who taught your grandmother how to bake? She comes over and bakes at our house all the time. She said she likes our oven even better than hers. Well, you must have a very nice oven at your house. We do. She comes over and bakes there all the time. And after we're done baking cakes, we decorate them, and stick candles in them, and we all sit around together and act like it's somebody's birthday. She comes over pretty often to do this, does she? Very often. Except, of course, when she's off in Hollywood shooting movies. Of course. Tell me something, Heidi. When Shirley temple comes over to bake with your granny, does she... does she ever tap dance for you? You know, show her the steps she's learning for her new movie? Sometimes she does. Sometimes she dances. And does she sing sometimes too? Well, if she's in the mood. Heidi, I'm a big Shirley temple fan. I think I've seen every one of her movies at least a dozen times. Which is why I happen to know that she hasn't made a new one in a very long time, and she'll never make another one, because she's dead, Heidi. Shirley temple is dead. She doesn't tap dance in your kitchen any more than I do. Yes, she's a rotten girl. Yes, little kitten. You're a beautiful little kitty. Shh, shh, shh. Precious bouquet, I'm here. It's all right. I'm right here. It's just dark. It's just dark. But we're good. We're good. Bernie? It's me. Are you and mama okay? We're sorry. The number you have called is having technical difficulties. Please hang up and try your call again later. Hey, that's mine! That's mine! Stop! Give it back! My gosh, wait, are you... Is she okay? No, Heidi, no. I know, precious. My heart is hurting, too. But, you know, what Heidi is doing is very important. Do you understand? It's very important. I know. I don't know if I understand. Somehow... I don't think our Heidi can be Heidi if she doesn't do this. I know. I know. Hey, hey! Wait a minute, I'm here. Wait, thanks. - Here's my ticket. - Yeah. Thanks. Tickets please, young lady. sorry. I got caught in the food line. My mom's saving me a seat. Where's your mother? She's the woman who got in right ahead of me. She's probably in the back. Well, which woman are you talking about? - She's the one... - I know the lady she's talking about. They were on my bus from Reno. Just wanted to make sure you found your connection. Yes, we found it. There'll be somebody at Liberty to pick you up? Yes, absolutely. Okay. I'm glad you found your bus. Thank you. "All the knights of the realm bowed down before the Princess. There were lambs roasting, there were chickens..." - Hello? - Will you accept a collect call from Heidi it? Yes, my god! Goodness, yes, yes! Heidi, Heidi! Thank god! - Hi, Bernie. - Heidi! Heidi, are you okay? I was scared out of my wits. - Hello, Heidi. - Mama says hi. - I'm here, Bernie. - Where, where? Where are you? I'm in Liberty. Sweetie. Did somebody hurt you? Heidi, are you hurt? No, Bernie, nobody hurt me. What's... What's happened? What's the matter? On the bus, I felt like I was going somewhere, but... now that I'm here, it feels like I'm nowhere. Nobody even knows I'm here, Bernie. that's not true, darling. I know you're there. As a matter of fact, I am looking at your globe at the very spot that you're standing on. Liberty, yep. I'm even waving at you. You see me? I'm the crazy old lady in the green house dress that's going to ground you for the rest of your life when you get home. Somebody stole all my money. Well, we'll fix that. We... We'll wire you a ticket. - A ticket? - You need to come home, Heidi. That isn't the wind you're hearing. It's Rochester, remember? In "Jane eyre," when she's standing out on the moor trying to decide? I remember. She didn't know if it was the wind or Rochester. It was Rochester, Heidi. And he needed her to come home. This isn't a book, Bernie. Can I help you? Yes. I'd like to go to hill house, please. Hill house? It's quite a ways. Cost you 15. - Dollars? - What else would it be? Yen? Um, what if I don't have $15? Then I say we won't be going to hill house. Can you call my friend? She has $15.00. How soon can she bring it? Well, she's in Reno, but she has a credit card. Sorry, kid. Cash only. Where's the nearest slot machine from here? Closer to your friend in Reno than here. - Can I hold the jar? - What jar? Up there. No one's tried that in years. Feeling lucky? Luck doesn't feel like anything. It's just there, like... air. One thousand... Five hundred. One thousand, five hundred. One thousand, five hundred... One thousand, five hundred, twenty... One thousand, five hundred, twenty-seven. I'd like to go to hill house, please. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? H, I... It, it, it... I, t, I, t... I'm so sorry. There was no one at the door so I just came in, but... Elliot, are you awake yet? Hi. All right, honey, gentle. No... - Sit down. - No. Hey, honey, it's okay, here, honey, have this. - Here, have water. Drink your water. - Wait. - Ruby? - In here, Mr. Hill. - That's it. - Thurman hill? - You're doing great. - Hello. - Who are you? - I'm Heidi it, and I have some questions I need to ask you, Mr. Hill. Hon, are you from your school newspaper? 'Cause Mr. Hill doesn't really go in for that sort of thing... I'm not from the newspaper. I just want to know about my mother. She used to live here. Your mother? What did you say your name was? It, Heidi it. "It"? I-t? Yes. And your mother's "it" as well? Well, I can tell you there's never been anybody here by that name. I'm pretty sure. It's an unusual name. But I have pictures. I know she was here. Wait a minute. This is ringing a bell. Are you related to someone named Bernadette? Yes, she's my neighbor. That's the woman that's been calling from Nevada, Mr. Hill. Remember that you told me that I should make sure... Never mind what I told you, Ruby. May I see these pictures? Yes. See, that's the house there, in the background. Can I see this? Yeah. And it's white. Well, that had to be a long time ago. I mean, it's been yellow ever since I've been here. We think it was about 13 years ago, because I'm 12 now, and my mom is pregnant in these pictures. She sure is. See? That's my mama there. Very pretty. Ruby, can you take Elliot into the room with the others? Maybe put some socks on his feet because the floor is cold? Thank you. Come on, Elliot, honey. Let's go the kitchen and get some applesauce, okay? Elliot, I want you to go with Ruby. Soof! What did you say? Elliot, Elliot, now. - Soof... - Go with Ruby. You have no right to be here. We have an arrangement! She sent you, didn't she? What does she want? Does she want more money? Well, she's not gonna get any more money, not one red cent. You tell her. You tell her that promises were made and paid for. I don't know what you're talking about. We called and called, but you wouldn't talk to US. That's why I came. Bernie didn't even know I was coming. Bernie? Who's Bernie? Bernie? She changed her name to Bernie or something? That's the name she goes by? Well, it doesn't make any difference. - Mr. Hill? - It doesn't change anything. I cannot have you coming around here stirring up trouble, not now. Can you come quickly, please, Mr. Hill? - Elliot 's having a tantrum. - Yeah, I 'll be there in a minute. Now, I'm afraid he's gonna hurt himself. Just tell him I'm coming. You have to go. For god's sake, just leave. Leave US alone. Doing all right in here? Mr. Hill! - Run! - Elliot, look at me. Let's do our breathing. Elliot. No! Aah! Let go! Let go! I'm not psychic. If you're not psychic, how do you explain calling ten coin flips in a row? I can't explain it. I just do it. - It's luck. - No, luck would be calling it five, maybe six. You did all ten. And your friend Bernie told me you would. I don't get it. Neither do I. That's the lady from hill house. She's my wife. I was stopping in to see her. Thought about taking her out to dinner, then you ran out of there and changed all my plans. - Sorry. - That's okay. I like Ruby's cooking better than any restaurant anyway. If you really are lucky, she'll have a pot roast. Well, hi, guys. If I 'd known we were gonna have company, I would've put on a pot roast. So you think soof is in this picture? I don't know. But Elliot called me "soof" earlier this afternoon, and maybe if we show him the photos he can tell US what it means. Well, we can't do much of anything without thurman hill's permission. And it doesn't sound like he's gonna cooperate. But why? - What did I do? - I'm hoping to find that out. My god. It's Elliot. Didn't recognize him with all that hair. Here's another one of him by the Santa. Yeah, that's him, all right. Roy, look at the Santa. That's Mr. Hill. I don't understand, Bernie. He knew mama, and grammy, too. Why would he lie about that? I don't know. What do Roy and Ruby think? They don't know what to think. Ruby says he's a good man. Well, it doesn't sound like it. Well, she's worked for him seven years. And Roy 's known him for even longer than that. What do his eyes say, Heidi? I don't know. No, think about it. Picture his eyes. What do they say to you? - He's afraid. - Of what? I don't know, but he's afraid. Heidi. Is mama okay? She doesn't sound good. No, she's all right, don't worry. She doesn't sound all right. Let me talk to her. Hang on. It's Heidi, precious. It's Heidi. Heidi. Hello, Heidi. Hello, mama. I'll be back soon, okay? I'll be back soon. Heidi be Heidi. What, mama? What did you say? I'll be back soon, and I'll never go away again. I promise, mama. Mama's go. What? - Mama's go. - No, it's okay. I'll be back soon, and it'll be just like before, you and me and Bernie. Shh, okay. Heidi, your mama needs to go. - Is she all right? - Yeah, yeah. She's gonna be okay. But, look, you do what you need to do, and you get home. I will, Bernie. Tell her I love her. She knows that. - Heidi be Heidi. - Bye-bye. Heidi be Heidi. Good morning, sunshine. How long did I sleep? Well, let's just say you caught up on what you missed. What are you doing? I washed your clothes last night. I thought we could keep them in an empty drawer so they won't get wrinkled. Thank you. He's just turning around, right? No, honey, he's headed up to hill house. - What? - Mr. Hill called this morning, and he's waiting up there with his lawyer. But... He knew I wanted to go, to show Elliot the pictures. Yeah, and Roy took the pictures with him. My pictures? He took my pictures? He's just doing his job, honey. He shouldn't have left without me. He knew I wanted to go. And he thought it was better this way. - Well, it won't be. - Listen, sometimes it just pays to let the grown ups sort this stuff out. Grown ups? Grown ups are the ones that tell the biggest lies of all. Baby clothes? I'm sorry, Ruby. I was just looking for my sweater. Um... it's outside, drying on the rack on the porch. No, I probably should get rid of these anyway. Just not today. Breakfast time. Hi. There were 1,527, but I ate a few yesterday, so I don't know the exact number now. You can have the rest. Wow, that's really sweet, honey. Where did you get these? I won 'em, with a lucky guess. I bet you did. 1,527? Originally. He was supposed to take me with him. I know. Life isn't always fair, is it? Hello? Okay. Yeah. Eat up. Roy's coming back. He's taking you to hill house. Really? Okay. Let's start with Diane demuth. According to county records, she was born in Liberty. She went to school here but dropped out for "personal reasons." I think we all know what that means. We do? There's no record of a marriage, only a birth, Sophia lynne demuth, born to Diane at Liberty west hospital 30 years ago on November 23rd. I don't understand. Who are these people? And what do they have to do with mama being at hill house? It's complicated, young lady. That's because you're making it complicated. My mother was here and you know it. Why can't you just tell me the truth? - Look, Heidi. - No, I have a right to know. I came a long way. This is wrong. Can I ask you gentlemen to step out, so that I can talk to Heidi alone? No, I don't want to be alone with you. Roy, you can't leave. It's gonna be okay. I'll be right outside. No, I don't want to be alone with him. He thinks I'm somebody I'm not. No, Heidi. I know exactly who you are. Mama's go. Mama's go. No, mama stays. You are not well enough to go anywhere right now. No, mama's go! Done, done, done. Uch, no, that awful bus. No, don't worry. No more buses, don't worry. No buses. You know, Heidi is coming home real soon. You don't have to go anywhere. And we're all gonna be together. This woman that you showed me, this picture? In fact... Is your grandmother. Your mother? Your mother's name is Sophia. Sophia? Sophia. And your grandmother brought Sophia to me, and asked me for help, and I wish to god I'd turned her away, but she... talked me into taking Sophia in as a charity case. And Sophia did very, very well here. She was very happy. And she made a best friend. Elliot? Elliot. My son, Elliot. And they were inseparable. I've never seen Elliot so happy. Elliot never really had any friends. Come on. What is it? What is it? Is there a pain? Don't move. Stay still. Don't move. Come on, come on. Lay down. And when Diane came to me with the news that Sophia was pregnant, I didn't believe it. And then she convinced me that Elliot, my son Elliot, was the father. An impossible situation, because these two, they were like children themselves. 1547 arroyo. Second floor. Apartment 26. Please hurry. I think it might be her heart. Precious? Precious? Hey, I just talked to Heidi. I just talked to her on the phone and she's on her way. Heidi be Heidi. Diane decided that she didn't want to stay here. She wanted to go away with Sophia to have her baby. She wanted to go far away, to Reno, Nevada. She needed money to do that. And then she threatened hill house, but she didn't have to. I agreed. I didn't want to see hill house's reputation ruined. I didn't want to lose everything. So your grandmother and I, we struck a bargain, and I would give her enough money to go away with Sophia so Sophia could have her baby, and I was supposed to open up an account in a bank. To pay for the rent and electricity. Wait here, they're here. They're here. I'm just gonna get a window up. Hey, wait. Hey! Hey! Wait. She... she's coming. Hang on, precious. Hang on. My god, they went too far. They went too far. They've gone too far. And in turn she would leave me and hill house in peace. Here, here! We're up here! Get them! Here! Up, up! God. God, god. Round the block, round the block. Up down, up down, curl the tail. God. Round the block. Up, down. Up, down. Curl the tail. And she would never again contact me, not when the baby was born, not after, not ever again, and I would know nothing about their lives, from that point on. God. Help! We're here! Around the block... And I paid a small fortune not to know. About me. About you. We're up here! Can... somebody! We're here! We're here! Help! Help... aah! Aah! Sorry, ma'am. God, help... Aah... - No, not me. - Take it easy, ma'am. - What? Got it. - She's inside. Then... You come around here asking questions. You thought I wanted more money. Where's my grandmother now? Your grandmother. Your grandmother, sweetie? Your grandmother's gone. She passed away. Roy, checked it out, and she found out that she had been hit by a bus, about 13 years ago, in Reno, Nevada. Was it in February? Yeah, as a matter of fact it was in February. February 19th. How in the world would you know that? We celebrate my birthday on the 12th. So it happened seven days after I was born. Is she all right? We're gonna get the line right open right now. Gonna hang a bag of normal saline. Pupils are fixed and dilated. Her pulse, pulse is weak and thready. Mama's go. Mama's go. Hang on, precious, okay? Hello. Soof. Precious. Precious. Precious! Precious. Precious. I came to Liberty to learn about my mama, maybe even my grammy, but it never occurred to me that I might find a father. I have a father. Thurman hill, my grandfather, told me that he thought Elliot would, over time, forget his Sophia, but Elliot never did. Mama couldn't pronounce the name "Sophia." She called herself "so be it." My father, Elliot, couldn't say her name either. He called her "soof." There's just so much I have to tell you, Bernie. You won't even believe it. Mama has a birthday, and a name. She has a beautiful name, Bernie. - Not now, baby. - No, you need to hear this. This answers all of our questions. Is Ruby there with you? Ruby? What? No. I'm at hill house, Bernie. Remember? Roy took me here. We'll talk later, Heidi. You'll call me. No, you can't hang up. I have to tell mama something. Not now, baby. You'll call me. You'll call... Heidi, you'll call me later. Ruby's here now. Heidi-ho. What is it, Bernie? Mama's gone. What? What do you mean? Your mama's gone. - Come here, my sweet. - I know, sweetie. Sweetie... Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay, sweetie. - It's okay. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. - I'm okay, Bernie. Things... I'll miss about mama. Hello! Hello! Heidi! Everything. You know what you look like? You look like a girl who's never gone fishing. I don't want to go fishing. I didn't ask if you wanted to go fishing, I just said you look like a girl who's never done it before. You know, I hate arresting people. I hate sending people to jail. I don't even like writing tickets. I mean, I don't even know why I'd become a cop until Ruby had her first miscarriage. Then it's when it hit me. I wanted to stop bad things from happening to people that I cared about. That's why I'd become a cop and I didn't even know it. But being a cop doesn't mean bad things won't happen... much as I may want it to. But you're still a cop. I'm still a cop. You're gonna have to decide where you want her to be buried, Heidi. Heidi, sweetie? It's dinner time. Aw, sweetie. How could you go, mama? It's okay, it's okay. Mama had a lot of names. Precious bouquet, Sophia demuth, so b. It. A long time ago, someone who loved mama very much gave her a different name. - Soof. - Soof. But when mama said "soof," she wasn't talking about herself. "Soof" was mama's name for "love." Back soon, mama. Soof. I've got you, honey. Heidi? This is everything that we have from our files on your mother. This one, and these are some photographs that were taken while she was here with US. There are some pictures in there, too, of the hill family. Thank you. I tagged each and every one of them so you'll know who's who. I mean, you know, if you ever want to meet anybody from the hill family, I'm sure they'd be delighted. After all, I mean, this isn't their fault. They didn't have anything to do with it. This is all my mistake. Heidi, I know that it seems impossible right now, but you're my granddaughter. I'd like to get to know you. I'd like that. Good. Bye. Bye-bye. Things to tell Bernie. One, I have two grandmothers, and I look like both of them. Two, I have a grandpa. Am I in trouble? No, honey, we just want to talk to you. About? We were wondering... If you might want to stay here with US for a while. Ooh. I'd have to ask Bernie. Bernie knows. If it's okay with her. We're talking about quite a while, Heidi. How long? Well, you know that little bedroom that you've been staying in? That would be yours. You could paint it whatever color you want it. Or you could wallpaper it. - I mean, Ruby's great with that stuff. - Yeah. And you could go to school here. There's a great junior high, and you could make friends your own age. And play sports. I bet you'd be a heck of a volleyball player. I know the coach and... Are you guys talking about me living here? Yes. But only if you want to. I mean, this house is too big for just the two of US. And I know that we've talked about moving into something smaller for a while. But we just... We... Maybe... we were waiting for you, Heidi. And we didn't even know it. Heidi, you're a big girl, and I cannot make this decision for you. But I can tell you this: Whatever you decide, it is fine with me. It's all fine. Roy and Ruby are good people. You're good people too, Bernie. Well, this isn't about me. It's not really about Roy and Ruby either, this is about what you want. I don't know what I want. You wanted family. That's what this whole trip was about, right? And Roy and Ruby will give it to you. And your grandpa's there, and your daddy's there. You got family. Whatever you decide, it's fine with me. Bye. - Bernie was right. - Bye, Heidi. The trip was all about family. Last one out's a rotten egg! In the end... Hey, Heidi, wait up! I found mine. It wasn't easy. - It took a long time. - Let's go. But Bernie can go outside now. Further and further. Yoo-hoo! There's fresh lemonade, if anybody's interested. - I am! - Me, too! She even went to one of my volleyball games. I wish mama could've been here to see it. Maybe mama knows. Maybe mama knew all along. I'll be there in a minute. I get the biggest cookie! I can't call heads or tails any better than anyone else anymore, but I didn't lose my luck. - Hey, guys. - I left it behind in Liberty, for Roy and Ruby. They have a baby now, a beautiful little girl they named Aurora. You can't touch this. Come on, come on. - You can't touch this. - Who wants to, Zander? Okay. Someday, if I have a little girl of my own, I know exactly what I'm going to name her. Sophia. So b. It. Amen.
