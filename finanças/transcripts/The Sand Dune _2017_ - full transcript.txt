I'm ready to turn that around. With school out for the summer, I talked mom into driving us to the beach house. It's down on the beautiful Texas coast. We like to think of it as the Corpus Christi Riviera, but it's not French. Well, it's Texas. That's Riley. Riley's quiet and sweet. But she's like a sister to me. And that's Jessi, my best friend. Oh, let me see. [Aylin] Jessi's older and has had-- You're blocking my light. [Aylin] ...lots of boyfriends. Rumor has it she's gone all the way. Well we set out to party and here we are. Last year there was a pathetic shortage of boys on the beach. Our whole vacation was trying not to step on jellyfish. I can't wait to get out there and meet some new boys. Boys that don't seem like the brothers we grew up with. -Yeah. -[Jessi chuckles] -Oh Jessi, you're not recording us, are you? -You guys are cute, look, look. -Oh, shaking it, yeah. -How about that? Music's so loud it's going to burst my ear drums. Do you always have to ruin everything? Hey, how about sharing? No, don't give her any, she's crazy when she drinks. -This is true. -Oh whatever, a little wine won't hurt, we're on vacation. I mean, I'm 19, I can go to war but I can't have a glass of w-- Here. She's the cool mom now, all right. Well, can I have some? -[Riley] No, you're too young. -No, I'm not. Oh, you are. Just a sip. -She got a glass. -[mom] She's older than you. Do you want it or not? -[Riley] Yeah! -Hey! [Aylin] Our number one vacation goal, hang out with some major hotties. -Where are we going? -It's a surprise. -Come on, just tell us. -All right, we're going to the Sand Dune. -Real question, is there a bar? -Jessi. What, what? I want to welcome everybody to the Sand Dune Bar and Grill this afternoon down here on the beautiful Texas coast. Yee-haw! [Aylin] Wow, a giant tiki hut? Boys in hula skirts toss flowers? Okay, reality check, it's my mom's favorite Texas hangout. Oh, those guys are hot. Especially that one. Oh, I like that one, he looks sweet. That's it, I'm going over. Me too. Come on, Aylin. [guy] Don't lie, listen to me, I'm serious I wish-- I wish they had been there. How are ya? Hey cutie, yeah you're coming with me, come on. Yes, ma'am. Hi, um. [Aylin] Hi. You can sit here if you want. Thank you. Kind of hidden back there. Yeah, it's uh, hope you like dried palm fronds. So, my name's Jake. I'm Aylin. It's nice to meet you, Aylin. That ugly guy that went off running with your friend, that's my buddy from college, his name's Jarrod. Cool. -Where you from? -Oklahoma, but we have a beach house down here. Nice. I was born and raised here. I never got to go anywhere 'til I went to college. Who are your friends? That one there's Jessi, and that pretty girl behind me, -she's Riley. -[Jake] Hey, Riley. Hi. -Sittin' all by yourself? -Thanks, that's real nice. What are you into? When I'm home I just hang out with friends, play football, work out. I'm boring. -What do you like to do? -Well, when I'm back home, I usually just hang out with friends, play football, work out. I'm boring. -Okay. -I do boring things. Mhmm. They say great minds think alike. -Is that what they say? -That is what they say. We should hang out. Maybe. You know something? You have got the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. How do you, or is there like eye modeling? -You ever think about modeling? -I'm going to be an actress. An actress, huh? That's cool. -How old are you? -[Aylin's inner voice] Tell him the truth. Eighteen. -[Aylin's inner voice] Oops. -Oh. You look older, but in a good way. I'm 22, it's a great song, do you want to dance? Do you want to dance with me? Sure. Watch your head. -You just got to follow my lead, all right? -Okay, okay. You're gonna under. [Aylin's inner voice] Ugh, he dances like a pigeon with one leg. You spin, you spin again. [Aylin's inner voice] Is that an old girlfriend giving you the evil eye? Oh, you know how to two step, thought you were from Oklahoma? I guess it's all natural. I'm not gonna argue with that. -So, Jake, who's your friend? -This is Aylin, Aylin, this is my little sister, Natalie. You can call me Nat. Hi, nice to meet you, Nat. -You go to school around here? -No, actually I'm-- -We're missing a good song. -Oh. Let's go. [Aylin's inner voice] No worries. False alarm, it's just his sister. [Aylin laughing] You're kind of good at this. [playing country music] [Aylin] Here come Jessi and Jarrod. There's no way they were dancing that whole time. I know Jessi better than that. [Jake] I'm pretty sure this place is made of palm trees. Yeah, you remember exactly where we were? I do, it was your mom's house, that's why. -No. -It's a really easy place to remember. Don't talk about my mom, Jake. -[Jessi] What the hell? -Okay, that was creepy. [Jessi] Yeah, well, c'est la vie. How's it going out there? Honestly, pretty great. -Really? -Yeah. This boy just drives me crazy. I don't know, there's something different about him. I think I might kind of like him. You think you might kind of like-- are you actually hearing yourself, girl? -I mean- - I know. -you've met him a couple hours ago and you think he's your one true love or something? I know, I'm ridiculous. -Come on. -I know, I know, this is just vacation. I'm just gonna have fun. And be careful, you don't know everything about him. He doesn't know everything about me. [Aylin's inner voice] Like the fact puberty hit me at twelve. [Jarrod] So, it can be good protein. The one time I did eat a scorpion, though, I left the tail on- -Hey. -Hey. Wow. -What? -Your lips. -What about my lips? -They're a new color. Yeah, well your sister liked it. Really, hmm. What's wrong with my face? What didn't she tell me. Nothing, you look great. -Doesn't she look great, Jarrod? -Mhmm, yeah. -Yeah. -You look great, you can trust him, he got all A's in school. -Well, there was a B, but-- -Okay, I'm going to the bathroom. -That's a good idea. -Okay. [Aylin's inner voice] Okay, putting eyeliner on my lips, definitely not my smoothest move, but the tiki torches, the boy sitting across from me? It's not Hawaii, but I'll take it. I think the lovely lady deserves a flower, don't you? There you go. Well, thank you, but I'm more of a sunflower kind of girl. I'll remember that. -Will you? -Yeah. -What about five or ten years from now? -Yeah. Especially on such a pretty girl like you. [Aylin's inner voice] Giddy-up, I think I found myself a cowboy. ¶ The summer days When you walked in ¶ ¶ I knew then that this Would never end ¶ ¶ I felt the heat Beneath my skin ¶ ¶ I could feel the whole world Start to spin ¶ ¶ After all the years gone by ¶ ¶ I think about The tears I cried ¶ ¶ Couldn't seem to get you Off my mind ¶ ¶ Of all the places I have gone ¶ ¶ I've never felt Like I belonged ¶ ¶ Always seem to swim Against the tide ¶ ¶ Every time my life Seems to fall apart ¶ ¶ You were like a lifeline Around the heart ¶ ¶ In my dreams, in my dreams ¶ ¶ You were like a drug That I couldn't quit ¶ ¶ I can feel your blood As it slowly drips ¶ ¶ From my veins ¶ [Aylin's inner voice] Looks like this might be the best summer ever. You know, I had a good time tonight. You think I could see you again? You know I bet you guys could come over. I don't think my mom would mind. -Yeah? -Yeah. Hey, Jarrod. -Yeah? -We're going to Aylin's. You got it. Done. Hey, everybody, pictures. Come on, come on! [Aylin's inner voice] I wish mom would quit taking those pictures for her scrapbook. So embarrassing. [Natalie] Can I please go with you guys? Sorry, Nat, there's only two kayaks. Will you take me later, then? Just hang out with Jessi and Riley. Jessi told me to eff off. I'll be back soon, I promise. Just have fun. [Jessi] Get over here. Hey, hurry back then. -[Jessi] Hey, remember that one time? -[Jake] Will be back soon. -where one of our friends-- -Ready? -put something on her lips that wasn't lipstick? -[Aylin] Bye, you guys. [Jessi] Remember that one time? [chuckles] [Riley] Aylin! -[Riley] Stop! -[Jessi] Hey! Get out. Get over here. [Jarrod] You gotta come back. [Jessi] Where did you find him? He's so stupid. [Riley] Disgusting. [Jessi] Although, I'm glad we met you guys. We needed some testosterone, right? Do you lift? [Jarrod] He might do anything other than lift. They don't wake your neighbors. They won't, there's no one here for them to wake. All of the snow birds who live around me fly north for the summer. [sighs] You know, I've never been back here, it's kind of hidden. Well, surprise. Surprised about a lot of things tonight. You know my parents bought this place so they could go sailing. You have a sailboat? No, well we used to, but my mom had to sell it. Reminded her of Dad. Did he leave? No, he killed himself. He had PTSD and uh... I'm sorry. It was last Thanksgiving. So, as you can expect, the holidays aren't really my favorite thing. I know what you mean. You do? Yeah. My brother passed away when I was 16. Oh, Jake, I'm so sorry. It's all right. He was in a car accident and they had to take him to the nearest city 'cause there was no qualified surgeon here. By the time he got there, it was too late. He was gone. Known what I was gonna be since that day though. And what's that? A doctor. You'd make a pretty great doctor. Yeah, you'd make a pretty good superstar. Oh god, no I wouldn't. We'd be a power couple though. -Really? -Yeah. I don't think superstars go for doctors. Well, there's a first time for everything, so. I think you might be right. Wanna head back? Yeah, let's go. [calm music] [splash] [splash] Wow. -What? -You a mermaid? Maybe. How'd you guess? Dunno, this might have something to do with it. I don't know what it is. Don't you know what mermaids eat? -Tons of fish? -No, men. You know what their favorite are? Young men, poor helpless sailors, or just maybe college students returning for home during the summer. -Yeah? -Yeah. .You know what it sounds like? -What? I shouldn't get too close. -Ah, ah, ah! Break it up, you two. -[clears his throat] -Jake, time to go. -Yes, ma'am. All right, Jake, let's go. All right. Come on. Just give me a sec. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. [Jarrod] Nat's got shotgun. [sighs] [Aylin] I really like this guy. [mom] Aylin, you know how much I love you. [Aylin] Yeah, of course. Well, it's about you and Jake. Now, I think he's a fine young man, but I worry about certain things, temptations. What- What I'm trying to say is I'm worried about you two having sex. Mom, we wouldn't do that, we're not stupid. Well, maybe not but I, I still worry. Aylin, you're so young. Yeah, but it's not even like that. We hold hands and kiss, I swear. I believe you, but whoa when I see you two look at each other, I can't help but think that I, well- Well, you know me better than that, Mom. I was young, too. I know. So, listen to me. I don't think I want to. Well, too bad, you don't have a choice. It's been a very hard year with your dad's death and all. And I'd hate a wedge to come between us because of a boy. That would never happen, Mom. Yes, Aylin, it could, I've seen it. -When? -Well, it happened to me, a long time ago. A boy came between me and my parents and it wrecked our whole lives for a long time. -You never told me that. -Well, no need to. I've decided that you can continue to see Jake on one condition, that someone has to be with you two always. -Do you understand? Always. -[sighs] Yeah. -All right? -All right, yes. Okay, all right then, that's enough said about that. Oh, and one more thing, don't try to sneak out together. I know something about that, too. -So, what is your favorite part of a s'more? -The marshmallow, definitely. -Really? -Yeah. -How do you like it? -Golden, perfect golden. -Golden? -Yeah. That's a hard thing to achieve. Maybe for you, but I for one am a master s'more cooker. -How do you like it? -Charred, not charred actually, just not charred. -Do you remember the other day when we were at the beach- -One not charred actually, not charred marshmallow. Thanks. Oh my God. [Aylin's inner voice] Uh-oh. Well, it's golden all right. Here, done. [Jessi] Oh that's mine. get away from that. Ew, Jake. -Are you okay, man? -Oh, my God. -Ooh, Jake. -It's sandy. -Oops. -Now give me a sandy kiss. - I have to give you a sandy kiss now. -No. Yeah. It's like brown sugar, you'll love it. -No, no, no. -[Jessi] Aylin! -[Jake] Come on, come. -[Jessi] Gross. -[Aylin] No. -[Riley] Jessi and Jarrod are going with you. Don't be gone long or I'll call the Coast Guard. -I got you, I got you. I got you. -[mom laughs] If you're gone too long, I'll call the Coast Guard! Take a walk with me somewhere. I wanna show you something. Okay. -You wanna go? -Let's go. Come on, Aylin. I'm not as fast as you. -There. -[Aylin's inner voice] Thank God Jessi and Jarrod ditched us. It's beautiful. [Jake] You know this area's famous. -For what, mosquitoes? -Whooping crane. I think you're confusing wildlife with a disease from the 1800s. No, not whooping cough, whooping crane. It's a special breed of big awkward bird. How big are we talking, like a turkey, a crow? Actually they get up to five feet tall, can have a seven foot wingspan, they make that whooping noise, so. I'm gonna need to hear this, can I get a demonstration? No. For the sake of science? Please. -All right. -Only for science. And you can't laugh. Whoop whoop, whoo-oop. [laughs] All right. -Okay. -All right. Okay, so where are these so-called whooping cranes? I don't see any of them. Probably on their way back to Canada. They're like the snow birds in your neighborhood. They come down here for the winter, leave for the summer. -Do you think they fly over Oklahoma? -Yeah, they're made for life, so their partner dies, they probably won't find another. That is sad. They have an elaborate courting ritual. -What's that like? -They get to know each other with a little dance. Kind of like how we first met at a dance. I'll show you. First, they get to know each other by bowing their heads. My name's Jake, and you are? Aylin. Pleased to meet you, Aylin. Then they start flapping their wings. -Oh, is that what they do, huh? -Just like this, come on. I can't court myself. -Oh, no, no. -I need a partner. I'm not imitating a bird. -Like this? -Good, yeah, you're getting the hang of it. -You look very elegant. -Oh. Then they jump. And spin, spin. -They jump again, impress each other. -[laughs] Just like that. Whoo-oop! They're bound forever. -Forever? -Yeah. And once their dance is done, they're soul mates for life unless, you know, something bad happens. I'll race you down. Wait. [Jake] All right, now that we've had our science lesson, it's time to show you my top secret base. Oh. Not done yet. Welcome to Area 52. -That sounds dangerous. -You're going in. [Aylin] Very interesting, excuse you. [Jake] Not so much dangerous as much as secretive. [Aylin's inner voice] This is so romantic. [Aylin] God, these sand dunes are huge. Wow. It still hasn't changed. You know I haven't taken anyone here in years. You're gonna love it. I already do. All right, be careful, it's a little slippery. I can tell. [Jake] My brother and I used to run up and down these dunes. It was like our little secret slice of paradise. When he died, all I ever wanted to do was forget. But now, with you here, I feel like I can do anything. [man] Are you Jake and Aylin? You kids have any idea how much trouble you've caused tonight? My mom's gonna be so worried, I gotta go. -[mom] Aylin! -Mom. -Oh God! Are you all right? -Yeah I'm okay. I was so worried. We just fell asleep at the beach. -You guys, where have they been? -[mom] Come on. They'll be here, relax. Jakey and Aylin. You drive, I'm too tired. Come on, girls. Oh, y'all are in trouble. [Riley] Are you okay? You're mom's going insane, I can't take it anymore. Well, where you been, man? At the expense of sounding too cliché, I think I fell in love tonight, Jarrod. Okay, well I'm driving, so let's go. The keys. Hey, Aylin! I love you! -[Jessi] Whoo! -[mom] Aylin, get in the car now, please. [Jessi] Oh my God, he loves you. -[Riley] Get it girl! -[Jarrod] All right, come on, lover boy, let's go. [Jessi] Bye, Jake. [Aylin's inner voice] [sighs] I really messed up. I'm in way over my head. I'm psyched to get to the beach, gotta be catching some rays today for sure. Did you girls put on enough sunblock? Well, how am I supposed to tan if I wear sunscreen? Jessi, you have to put on sunscreen or you'll burn to a crisp. I never burn. Aylin, I thought you'd be excited to go to the beach. I heard Jake say he'd be there. I am. [mom] Well, you don't look like it. Yeah, you're acting kind of weird. Mom. Yes? -There's something I actually need to tell you. -What is it? -What? -I told Jake I was 18. What? He's crazy about you, everyone saw the way he looks at you. Don't make me feel any worse than I already do. I didn't think it would matter. Well, being dishonest always matters. I know. You've got to tell Jake that you're not old enough. [mom] Jake needs to know you're not 18, you need to tell him right away. No, you've got to tell him today. And if it goes wrong we can just go to another beach. You've gotta tell him. Okay. [Aylin's inner voice] Okay, at least mom doesn't know about my fake ID. [girls cheering] [mom] We have arrived. We have arrived. -Hey, don't forget what we talked about, promise? -I know. -[Jessi] Hey, guys. -[Jarrod] Hey, ladies. -[Jessi] Hey, Jarrod. -[mom] Well, hello. [Natalie] Perfect day for the beach. Bet it will be crawling with kids. What do you think, Aylin? I think it'll be fine, it's a big beach. Oh I think one kid will practically be on top of us. Don't you agree? Well, Jessi, I'm sure there'll be plenty of children, but I'm pretty sure there'll be plenty of assholes too. Whatever. What was that all about? I don't know. [laughing] Hey. Hey. Everything okay? You seem a little quiet. Jake, we need to talk. Okay. -What's up? -No, not here. Not with all of this around. Yeah. Can we go somewhere private? Um... The ice cream shop. Let me grab my shirt. I'll be right back. I can't believe the ice cream shop is closed. -What's goin' on? -Listen, I just thought it would be a fun night, we'd go out and dance and sing, and then we'd go our separate ways. But you came over and we just had this great time. Aylin, it's okay. You can tell me, whatever it is. I'm really actually 16. What? I'm really sorry, Jake. Oh. Wow, um. [sighs] Um. You really do look older than that. I know, I should have said something sooner. All right. Here's the way I look at it. The age difference thing is not that big of an issue. -So, you don't care I'm only 16? -Well, no, I care. It's where we are in our lives that's the problem. I mean, you, still have to finish high school and I've already done all that. Yeah. -And I can't ever go back again, I just-- -Yeah, I know. Plus, I think everyone would look at me as that creepy old guy, and I don't want to be that guy. I would have never even gone for you if I would have thought you were that young. -Yeah. -I mean, what'd everybody think? You know? You want to get out of here? Come on. [Aylin's inner voice] This doesn't look good. Okay, just smile and act like nothing happened. See, I'm not a cherry person, though. Do you want a cherry? Oh, I can't believe I forgot to put on sunscreen. No joke. Look how nice my skin looks. Oh. Lou Anne, honey, why don't you go on home? -I think the guys can give us a ride, right? -Oh yeah, no problem. I could use a cold shower and aloe vera, so thank you very much. -[mom] Bye, kids. -[Jessi] Bye, Lou Anne. Bye, Mom. Wow. It's good. I'll be right back. Okay, I got to get in. Yummy. Take my fork, take my fork. -That looks so good. -Anybody wants this cherry? Hey. Hi. What's up? Nothing. That does not look like nothing. I'm just thinking. Is it about earlier? [sighs] Yeah. A hundred years ago it wouldn't matter, but today's day and age it's different. It's not normal, it's looked down upon, it's rejected. I know that. It just feels right. But society says it's wrong. Jake, it's fate. Simple as that. I'd like to think that. [Aylin's inner voice] This is fate, but can he really get over the age thing? So. -So? -I have something I want you to hear. -You do? -Mhmm, yeah. ¶¶¶ This is the song from the other night. ¶ Summer days When you walked in ¶ I kind of think of it as our song. I wouldn't forget. Me too. Here. I made you a copy, but you have to remember to think of me every time you play it, deal? -Every single time? -Yeah. Deal. [Jake] She just does, she does it for me. She makes me want to feel. I can't believe you said you love her, though. Too soon. I feel like I can fly. Natalie, why don't you go to your room? Your mother and I need to talk to Jake. Oh, okay. I'm gonna go chill in your room, man. Okay. See you around. Hey, guys. You're home early. What's going on? Well, you tell us what's going on. 'Cause you see, Natalie called us. She said that you were too busy to talk to her. Thought we'd like to know what you'd been up to. Told us about a friend of yours. -What was her name? -Aylin. Ah, yes, Aylin. And I heard she led you to believe she was much older. -[sighs] -[dad] Jake. Yeah. A girl that will lie about her age is up to no good. You just need to forget about her. No, Doug, I don't need to forget her, that's ridiculous. Don't disrespect your father, he is just trying to protect you. Mom, I like this girl. I mean I really like this girl. Like, like? Jake, I'm not gonna let you piss off your future on some hussy you met down on the beach. You hear me? You don't even know her. [dad] You're going to Med School, Jake. You owe it to your brother. You know I have spent the last six years feeling responsible for his death. Your brother's death has nothing to do with this girl. But it does. Mom, ever since we lost Donnie, I have not been able to focus on anything else. And she makes me feel something, Mom. She makes me feel something, right here. Love? If you decide to see this girl again, there will be no help from us with Med School. You can't just take that away from me, that is what I have worked for, my motivation, my ambition, my drive, everything goes back to that. Well, then you know how God damned serious we are. She's leaving tomorrow. Can I at least say goodbye? Hand over your phone and the keys to your truck. Come on, hand them over. Doug, I'm not going to give you my phone and keys. If you want my help with Med School, we're going to do this my way. Hand them over. I hope you feel good, 'cause I don't think I can ever forgive you. And you're not even my dad. You know what? I can't. Hey. Hey. We're all packed up to leave. -How are you holding up out here? -He didn't show. Yeah, well, it's okay. He wasn't tall enough for you anyways. Aylin, if it's any consolation, he made a huge mistake. [mom] Come on, time to go. We have a long drive ahead of us. Come on, let's go home. 'Morning. Yeah, 'morning, man. What do you need spare keys for, man? I'm gonna go see Aylin. Well, you better take the back roads. You're busted for sure if you go the usual way, especially with Nat out there. I'm just saying. I appreciate that. Not a problem, man, that's what I'm here for. See you. Have a good one. ¶ This feeling inside of my soul Is killing me ¶ ¶ There is no reason left Anymore for me to breathe ¶ ¶ In my mind I know it's over now I need to get away somehow ¶ ¶ This feeling inside of my soul Is killing me ¶ Come on. ¶ I can hear some voice That's calling me ¶ ¶ They say it's all For me to be free ¶ ¶ And I know There won't be another way ¶ ¶ There is nothing left For me to say ¶ ¶ I can hear some voice That's calling me ¶ [Aylin] Jake, if you read this note, I hope you know I waited for you, watching out the window, begging to God that you would come, pull up in your beat up old truck and tell me you love me. You need to know that the moment I met you, I fell deeply in love, and you know the honest truth when I say that time will never be an issue for us because in the end I know I'll be with you. Forever. Love, Aylin. [beeps] I'm actually a fan of the plastic bags. We recycle. Mike and I recycle, we're not part of the problem. -[woman] Absolutely. -But I did hear that they were gonna try to ban the plastic bags. We recycle ours, we don't use them for all kinds of things and it's just not fair they're gonna be taking them away from us. [woman] We just felt like the community wanted that, and it's good for us as well. [employee] I hear the film premier sold out in only two hours. -Excuse me? -I said, her new movie premier sold out in two hours. It's going to be in Austin, but everybody knows that. Well, I'll be damned. She actually did it, didn't she? Why would you say that, like you knew her or something? Oh, well, actually I did. Aylin? Dude, she is hot. So, what you guys go on a date or something? Yeah, yeah, it was a long time ago though, you know. Didn't really mean anything. [Aylin] Here I am in Hollywood. I'm told I have everything, great job, an exceptionally attractive boyfriend, fans, and even one very enthusiastic stalker. Something is missing though. The girl with everything feels nothing. Oh, cheese and rice, looks like somebody didn't get enough beauty sleep last night. Thanks. You are a hot mess. I know. I'm sorry, I couldn't fall asleep last night. Maybe it's like the legend. What legend? You know the one that says, you can't sleep because you're awake in somebody else's dream. Sorry, haven't heard that one before. Let's just hope you weren't awake in B-jorn's dream. Bjorn. Whatever. Oh my God, speak of the devil. Are all of his Snapchats of that variety? [sighs] I don't know, I guess I'm lonely and Bjorn helps a little. But you're not alone. You have your mom and Katrina and Riley and Jessi and me, -and all the crew. -I know, I know, it's just, I don't know I want somebody I can have a future with and I can't meet anybody new because I'm always on location. Sister, what you need is a vacation, not a lo-cation. Go somewhere where you can have some you time. That does sound nice. Except there's one problem with that. I can't go anywhere without somebody recognizing me. How would you like to be a red head? [growling] That might be fun. This is just what the doctor ordered. [laughing] There. Oh, it's perfection. -Look at you. -Good morning. Hi. Fantastic. Oh, honey. [Aylin] Don't need to say it. What have you been up to? You look like you've been in a boxing ring. How's your stalker guy? You simply won't believe the day we've had. Two clients backed out on a contract and one renter basically trashed a house so we have to go in and do a complete remodel. This day is costing us a fortune. Waiter, bring us your best Cav. Anyways, enough about me, how have you been? Well, Dionte and Katrina want me to start going out in disguise. As you can see I'm trying it out. Oh, they even gave me this wig. Why didn't you wear it today? Would have been better than that sorry ass hat you're wearing. No, your hat is fine, I like it. Thank you, and it's all I had time for this morning. I've seen a bit about you in the tabloids. Bjorn, huh? Nice butt, and those abs. Honestly, I struggle with taking guys seriously when he's prettier than I am. Personally I go by the philosophy of use them and lose them. There's too many hotties out there to choose just one. Don't listen to her, Aylin, she doesn't mean that. Like hell I don't. Whoo, see what I mean? There are so many of these creatures wandering around out there. One man's enough for me. I agree, one good one's all you need. There you are, ma'am. And for you, Miss? Aylin? Oh my God, it is you. Can I get your autograph? -Who do you-- who do you want me to make this out to? -Marty. And if you could say thanks for the fabulous service, I enjoyed every minute of it. Aylin. [Jessi] Actually, we got to go. -I've got to go, I'm sorry. -Come on. Get out of our-- get out of our way. [Aylin] Oh, Jesus. [Riley] Ladies, please. All right. How are you doing today, Mr. Linch? I've been better. Looks like you had a little fishing accident today. Think you can tell me about it? My buddy's fishing off the back, and I'm facing the other direction and just as he was casting, the wind caught his line and well, look here. Got myself an accidental nipple piercing and I can't get it out. Well, look at that. Looks like your buddy caught the big one today. I seen the girls on TV with piercings all over them, they even have them through their tongue. Now tell me, how can you eat with something like that in your mouth? -Tell me, how can you? -Well, I don't know, I'm just saying if it was ever a time to do it. -Are you sure? -Damn sure. Get this thing out. Ow! I need anesthetic room four, I'll be there in a couple minutes, okay? -Hey, nipple piercing, huh? -Yeah. They're so hot on guys. -Can I play with it? -Well, it's too late, we already took it out. Such a little fun sucker, aren't you? You know I'm thinking of getting one of those myself, -maybe both with rings. What do you think? -Uh... By the way, have you seen the waiting room lately? No. Be prepared, there are heaps of people coming in with jellyfish stings. I see yearly jellyfish invasions taking dozens of poor innocent tourists, happens every year, Janelle, you know this. So much for a quiet little practice by the sea. Hey, doctor, since you'll must likely be here late tonight. Don't know how many times I need to tell you, I don't date my staff, okay? There's always a first, you know, date. There we go, Aylin's lost love connection, page eight. "All the hoopla over Aylin's glitzy romance has come to an end after her infamous breakup with Bjorn." Bjorn. Never heard of him. The guy looks like the biggest tool bag I've ever seen, oh my God. [on TV] Hello, and welcome to another edition of Catch Our Vibe. I'm Russ Ray. And I'm Julia Hilder. Burning up the tabloids this week, a social media war between the mother of everyone's Hollywood honey, Aylin, and the person who's apparently been stalking the superstar. Mom, Lou Anne claims someone is after Aylin and is secretly snapping and posting photos of her daughter in various places around town. [Julia] Lou Anne says the fan's love sick posts are obscene and have gone too far. [Jake] I don't believe this. In frustration to make them stop, Lou Anne recently got herself thrown off several sites after posting some strongly worded messages demanding the stalker leave Aylin alone. I don't believe this. Catch Our Vibe reporters will continue to cover this breaking story and bring you- I don't see you for ten years and now you're everywhere I look. In other Aylin news, Catch Our Vibe has learned her on again off again romance with Bjorn is on again, for the fifth time. The two could be seen holding hands and Bjorn was not carrying his mog, who had been his constant companion. Are wedding bells in the future? This is who she dates? I mean come on. Accessorizing dogs. You know I haven't seen Bjorn in a couple weeks. I thought things would slow down filming, but in all honesty, it's just sped up. They have me flying out to an interview in the morning, but that same night they're sending me across the country to a talk show. Oh God. I know it's what the job calls for but I really wish they would lighten the load. Tell them to back off, you're working yourself silly. You should see the tabloids about me right now. Girls, why did you girls talk me into this? You know what they say, Mom. You gotta use it or lose it. That depends on what you're looking for. I gotta find a towel. [scream] Help! Somebody call 911! There's a lady on the ground in the locker room. [priest] For none of us has life in himself and becomes his own master when he dies. Or if we have life, we were alive in the Lord. If we die, we die in the Lord. So, then whether we live or die, we are the Lord's possessions. Happy from now on are those who die in the Lord. So it is says the spirit, for they rest from their labors. No, no, no, she is so beautiful but why-- why is her picture bigger than mine? No, without Fred there is no Ginger, they're saying this glam duo is donezo. No, we're not donezo, I'm heading over to her funeral right now, so I'm gonna take time away from filming. I don't care. I'm gonna go be by her shoulder in her hour of need. No, I don't know who died, what does that matter? What matters is publicity. I get publicity, she gets publicity, everybody's happy. The reporters will be there, I will be there by her side, they will love me, they will love her, end of story. [Aylin] I didn't have a clue my mom had a bad heart or I wouldn't have taken her to the gym. She never wanted me to worry and now my lifeline is gone. Of course, Bjorn wasn't there when I needed him most. How can I love a man that loves the mog more than me? How much longer until we reach this little shithole town? I would like to make it back to LA tonight. That long? [hangs up] I'm here, I'm here. -Where is everyone? -What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? I am here for you in your hour of need. You've gotta be kidding me. The ceremony is over. You know what? Everything is over. Bjorn, I needed you one time in my life. Over, what do you mean over? I don't understand how can they start the ceremony without me. That doesn't make any sense. I just got here. What? I get it, you need a shoulder to cry on. -It's okay. -Don't touch me, okay? Go, Bjorn, it's over. Aylin, if there's anything you need in the days ahead, -please don't hesitate to give us a call, okay? -Thank you. God bless. -How are you holding up? -Not very well. I think you're holding up pretty good. -Sweetie, what are you gonna do about Bjorn? -Dump him, please. It's already done. He's never gonna love anyone as much as he loves himself. Will you guys excuse me for a minute? Aylin! Are you really leaving without saying goodbye? I'm sorry, Riley. Can I ask where you're going? Someplace private. I need to get away, grieve on my own terms. The beach house. I know because I know you. Do you know how long you'll be gone? I don't know, as long as I need. The studio won't be too happy with me, but it's what I have to do. You should get going. Don't worry, I'll cover for you. Thank you, Riley. Yeah, don't mention it. Get out of here, the clock's ticking. Go find your love. [Aylin] I am utterly alone for the first time in my life. Time to go back, find myself, back to the beach house. But, the house will be so empty. When I come through that door, Mom won't be waiting. Hey there, doctor. -Janelle, how you doing? -What are you doing here? You are the last person I expected to see tonight. I don't know, it's been a rough week. Thought a few drinks might do me some good. I'll have the amber short. -How about buying a poor girl a drink? -Tell them what you want. I'll have the usual. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. Say, there is an empty booth over there. What do you say we go get to know each other a little better? Yeah, that sounds good. We never get a chance to talk at work, so, tell me a little bit about yourself. -What would you like to know? -What's your favorite food? I don't know. -What's yours? -Anything Italian. -Italian, really? -Yeah. Okay. I'd have to go with Mediterranean. -Okay. -Yeah. Yeah, sounds exotic. It kind of is. I've never had it before. Well, if you ever get the chance, you should try it. It is, I don't know, it's good. My house is only a block away. Let's do it. I thought you'd never ask. So, why don't you hang out here, and I'm gonna go slip into something more comfortable. [glass breaks] [Janelle] Oh, shit. -Janelle? -Yeah, I'm fine. I said I was fine. I need to know, did you take those from the clinic? No, I would never do that. Janelle, you need to tell me where you got the damn pills. -Jake, they're my pills! -Did you get them from the clinic? I mean, no, I don't mean they're my pills I mean, they belong to a friend, and I took them from her so that she wouldn't use them. Let's just forget about it. Janelle, I think you might need some help and- and you may need to go somewhere they can keep an eye on you for a while. I got someone who can help you, okay? Jake, no wait, please don't do this. Please, just calm down. Let's-- let's make another drink. Please, they're not mine, they belong to a friend. -Let's just-- please-- -Just got to call some- I'm begging you, okay? Let's relax, let's get to know each other, remember? Janelle. Jake, don't you dare! If you do this, I'll tell them it was you. If you call whoever you're gonna call, I will blame it on you, I will say that you made me do it so that my friend would sleep with you. You do what you gotta do, Janelle. [crying] Jake, please! [Aylin] It's hard being out here without Mom. It's so lonely. Oh yeah, I get that. Got a lot of memories there. Yeah, some not so good though. Oh I know, I remember it took you a full year before you could go back there after Jake. I know, it still makes me a little sad. Oh. Yes! Riley, I found the default notice. I knew it. Did you hear what I just said? Oh yeah, of course, I could see why it could still make you sad, especially without your mom. Nail him, we need our money. Just go out there, you know, make some new friends, have a good time. I don't know, it's not as easy as it sounds. Oh come on, stop wallowing in self pity, your mom wouldn't have wanted that. Go, do something. Maybe I'll grab a bite tonight at the Sand Dune. Wait, the Sand Dune? Didn't see that one coming. Hey, Riley, Riley, it's Aylin. She's thinking of going to the Sand Dune. [gasps] Put it on speaker, I want to hear. Hey, Aylin, it's Riley. We know what you're up to. What are you talking about? After all these years you think we don't know that you still carry a torch for that boy? I mean, come on, do you think we're really that stupid? But I'm not carrying a torch for Jake anymore, really, I'm not. Yeah, okay, whatever you say, girl, but I have a plan. I think you should go down to the Sand Dune, you need to find Jake, wherever he is. Do some sort of romantic gesture. [Jessi] Riley, will you take this paperwork to the attorney's office ASAP? All right, bye Aylin, and remember, go follow your love. It's the only way. -What are you guys doing? -[Jessi] Nothing, just work. You know, I really gotta run. Can I call you back later? Bye. [Aylin's inner voice] Jessi's right, life goes on. Mom would have wanted it that way. And Riley's a mind-reader. I've always wondered what happened to Jake. Thanks. A crazy fashion phenomenon called a mog has taken American men by storm. Small dogs are considered the hottest new fashion accessory for men this season. Many find this new trend strange, but the movement has gained sufficient momentum since Hollywood star and ex-Aylin love interest, Bjorn, publicly showed off his mog. Russ, do you have any thoughts on this one? [Julia] You're so cute, aw. [Russ] And now here's Romeo with more entertainment news. [whispering] -Excuse me, sorry. -Sorry. [Aylin's inner voice] I guess I should have expected it. Going out incognito isn't as easy as I thought. I think I'll go for a swim. Maybe it will relax me. Okay, concentrate on the beautiful day. The water is warm and soothing. What could possibly go wrong? [breathing heavily] Doctor! Doctor! I can't-- Uh, shot, epinephrine shot. Don't you say a word about who's in this room. The media will be all over this if you do, do you understand? Yes, doctor. All right, I'm gonna stay in here. Oh, God, did I die? Jake? Hi. It's been a while. Yeah. How are you feeling? I think I've been better. You had an allergic reaction to a jellyfish sting. Throat nearly swelled shut but you're fine now. We got it all fixed up for ya, so. Oh, your wig is over there, we had to put it aside. Oh, no, no, no, I can't be here right now. -Calm down. -I gotta go, I really can't- Aylin, hey look, you need to understand your body has just been through a very traumatic experience. It's not safe for you to drive home right, and I can't let you drive home right now so just do me a favor and wait, okay? No, but if the media sees me here. I'm ready to leave, I could-- I could give you a ride home. I do remember the way, so. Okay, but you gotta go get me my red wig. I need to go incognito. Red suits you, but I prefer blonde. [Aylin's inner voice] I couldn't dream in a million years, Jake, Dr. Jake, would be saving my life. Here we are. Yeah. I remember. Thanks for doctoring me up today, and the ride home. Yeah. It was my pleasure, I-- [clears his throat] I'm just happy you're okay. How long you gonna be in town? I'd-- I'd like to see you again. I'd like that. [message alert] I saved your note. You have to read it out loud. -You promise? -Maybe. [Aylin] You need to know that the moment I met you I fell deeply in love and you know the honest truth when I say that time will never be an issue. I can't believe you saved this. [Aylin's inner voice] I was crazy for Jake back then. Things are different now. My life is just way too complicated to fall for him again. So, there I was with this baby capuchin monkey. -Well, it's capushin monkey, but... -No, it's capuchin. Okay, it's capuchin. Okay, you're a doctor not a zoologist. -What happened? -So, we're running through the airport with this baby capuchin monkey, TSA was not happy. -What'd they do? -They took Mittens. -You named the monkey Mittens? -Yeah. -It needed a name. -It's cute I guess. I remember when you told me you were only 16. Oh, God. -Do you remember that? -How could I forget that? I was petrified. I was so sure you were gonna bolt. I almost did. I just knew I couldn't leave. That's not what happened. I know. What about now? What about now? Us, what do you-- think about us? I don't know. My life's pretty crazy. -Yeah. -I mean, come on, I can't go to the house without that red wig on. Yeah, we could do it without the wig. But I'm serious. You remember when your mom got sunburned? Everything about this place reminds me of her. I didn't mean to bring that up, I'm sorry. Wanna get a movie, popcorn? Me, you, a TV, couch, popcorn? Sounds like my kinda night. ¶¶¶ Come on, dance with me, please dance with me, spin. Guess who? Jesus? No, no, no, no. I love these pants. I can't do anything for you, the water loves you. -The water loves you. -[laughing] Now I gotta come in. Whoo! [chattering] ¶¶¶ [Jake] It's a fashion statement. [Aylin] It's not a fashion statement, I know more about fashion statements. I'm in disguise, just like you, just shh. You know I think you got a little something. -Right here? -Yeah. Let me just, come here. -What are you doing? -Let me just... [grunts] -Oops, sorry, did-- did that hurt? -Yeah. You look pretty good in this, what is this, an Italian barber mustache? Yeah, well, I hope you're happy because now the paparazzi are gonna be all over me. I was thinking about this, I'm shooting a feature next month out in California and I was kinda hoping you would want to come out and visit. -I mean- -California? Yeah, couple days or weeks, I don't know. But it, just for fun. I just, you know I don't think it's my scene. Lived 32 of my life as a small town country boy, and plus I got the clinic and I employ people there. But I'll be here when you come back. No, I understand. You know, as beautiful as you look with that wig on in all these lights, I think we should get out of here. -You wanna go? Yeah? -I'd like that. Put it on my tab, Bill. [Bill] Y'all have a good night, Jake. This just in to Catch Our Vibe, Aylin and Bjorn are back together for the sixth time. The Hollywood power couple will star in the upcoming movie Dancing with the Devil, which starts shooting next week. [message alert] Aylin, it's me, your hot and ever adoring better half, Bjorn. Heard the news we're starring in a new hit film called Dancing in Dublin, or something. Anyway, babe, the point is the world needs to be inspired by true beauty, like when the two of us are seen together. You gotta admit, there's no one hotter than moi. Seriously, I'm looking at myself in the mirror right now. I look like so amazing. [Aylin's inner voice] Typical. Just too typical. Hey. You-- you leaving? Yeah. Jake, I gotta go back to work. I got contracts, obligations, I got people who work under me. Yeah. [sighs] So, when are you leaving? My flight leaves tomorrow at six. Tomorrow at six. Well, that's quick. When are you coming back? I don't know if I'm coming back. All right, what do-- what do you mean, you don't know if you're coming back? Jake, what do you want me to say? I want you to say you're coming back. I can't say that. I'm not the same girl you met ten years ago. What are you talking about? What does that mean? So, you come back and spend a couple weeks with me, and you know everything? Everything you missed in ten years. Yeah. You know sometimes I think I know you a little better than you know yourself. You know what I think? I think you're scared. Scared of being vulnerable, needing somebody, needing me. 'Cause I, I need you. I need the fake mustache and I need the wig, I need two stepping in the kitchen. I need all that 'cause I need you. I don't know why we work together, we just do. We're like a two-piece puzzle, we just, we just fit. I mean, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Jake, ever since I was 16 and I met you, you left something in me. And my mother's death, it's been there-- I've always been yours and I probably always will. Yeah, and I'm here now. Nothing's changed. I'm right here, I'm not going. You don't have to go anywhere. I never said I didn't need you. But right now I need you to go. Please. [sighs] I can't lose you again. Just go, please. Please. You know you are-- breaking my heart.
