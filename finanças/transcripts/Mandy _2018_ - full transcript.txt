I was reading that book about the galaxy. That big, thick one? Yeah. It's pretty awesome. What's your favorite planet? Jupiter. Yeah, no doubt. Jupiter. How come? Mm... Well, because the surface of its atmosphere is a storm that's been raging for, like, 1,000 years, and the eye of the hurricane is so huge that it could just swallow the whole Earth. Yeah. That's... That's my favorite planet. - That's wild. - Mm-hmm. What's yours? Um... Saturn, probably. Yeah? Saturn's pretty cool, and that was one of the first ones that we discovered, that humans discovered, so there's, like, a lot of cool ancient myths about it and stuff. I changed my mind. What? I like Galactus. Galactus isn't a planet. Yeah, but he eats planets. Woof. Woof, woof, woof. [ Birds chirping, animals calling ] [ Static hissing ] Hey. Are you awake? Yeah, baby. What is it? You were having a bad dream. Uh-huh. What was it about? I can't remember. Sometimes I wonder if we should move away from this place. Where? I don't know. No. I like it here. It's peaceful here, right? This is, like, our little... This is our little home. Did I ever tell you about the starlings when I was a little kid? No. I don't think so. In the neighborhood where I grew up, there were all these starlings flying around in the trees, playing and chirping, and they were so cute. But my dad... ...he just hated them 'cause they were always eating cherries from the cherry tree. Anyway, one day... One day, me and a bunch of the other kids from the neighborhood were playing in this empty lot. And my dad came walking across with a pillowcase... ...and a crowbar. And there was something moving around inside of the pillowcase, like, squirming around. And he said we should gather 'round. He had something to show us, and so we all gathered 'round, and he emptied what was in the pillowcase on the ground. And it was a... It was a bunch of baby starlings. And he told us that he was gonna show us how to kill them. And he lifted the crowbar up real high... ...and then... ...brought it down real hard on the little baby bird. So hard that it pushed it in the ground. It was so deep in there, like a little grave, you know? And then he gave the crowbar to one of the kids, and then... each kid took a turn in... killing a starling. What'd you do? I, um... ...just watched, and then when it was my turn, I just ran away. Oh, baby. Come here. MANDY: "Under the crimson, primordial sky... ...surrounded by the jagged rocks of the ancient volcanic mountain, the wretched Warlock reached into the dark embrace of the fissure until his hand touched a smooth glassy surface. Cold as ice. His fist closed around The Serpent's Eye. Slowly he withdrew it and held it before him in the fading light of the blood-red suns. It glowed from within. A ghostly emerald light. Strange and eternal. " [ Tv playing in distance ] What's the matter, Jeremiah? Are you all right? No. I'm not all right. Did I do something wrong? Wrong? Everything you do is wrong. I'm so sorry, Jeremiah. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? There is nothing you can do. It's her. I feel naked without her. Naked. Do you hear me? I- I... I said, "Do you hear me?" Yes, Jeremiah. I hear you. "Yes, Jeremiah. I hear you. " Really? Because, sometimes, I don't think you hear anything at all. And I am truly worried about that. If you are not with me, you will not ascend. - MARLENE: Jeremiah, I... - Please... just be quiet and go fetch me Brother Swan. Okay. I said, "Go fetch me Brother Swan. " There you are. What can I do for you, Jeremiah? I need you to get me that girl I saw. I need her. I need her now. Jeremiah, consider it done. Do you have the Horn of Abraxas? Do you know what to do? I do. Hey. Why don't we offer up the porker, too? Just to seal the deal. That is such a good idea. That lard-ass, he couldn't find his nose in a mirror. [ Laughs ] I knew I could count on you. I can always count on you. Buddy. Oh, thank you, Jeremiah. Thank you. Before you go... ...send in Sister Lucy. BROTHER SWAN: Of course. [ Footsteps approach ] MARLENE: That's a cool T-shirt. Oh, thanks. What you reading? MANDY: A novel. Oh. How do you like it? Yeah, I think it's Lenora Tor's best book. Hmm. I guess you live around here. Yeah. We live just down near Crystal Lake.

A dream he's having right now. Won't you join us in that dream? I'm sorry for all this fuss and muss. But when I saw you on the road the other day... ...you called out to me... ...silently. And I listened. Look at me. [ Echoing ] Look at me! Tell me. What do you see? I see the reaper fast approaching. Well, I recognized you, so I think in time... ...you will recognize me. You know, all he wants is for his children to love one another. Now, I find that he allows me to express that love in many ways, but one of those ways... ...is music. Do you like the Carpenters? I think that they're sensational, but this is even better. [ Crackling ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] What do you think? [ Moans ] Shh. Shh. Wait.

For a while now, word's been coming down from the big rigs something dark and fearsome out there. No one knows where they come from. First, it was stories from the interstate. Leaving truckers for dead, prostitutes vanishing, and gutted bodies on doorsteps. And always the same. Biker gang, black bikes. Only seen at night. Weird shit. There's stories that there was a chapter than ran courier for a manufacturer of LSD. Took a disliking to them and cooked them up a special batch, and they have never been right in the head since. I seen them once from a distance. What you're hunting is rabid animals, and you should go in knowing that your odds ain't that good, and you will probably die. Don't be negative. Last I heard on the CB, they were spotted down near Spirit River. When I seen them things, they were in a world of pain. But you know what the freakiest part was? What's that? They fucking loved it.
