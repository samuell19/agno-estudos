I can tell her face doesn't ring a bell Maybe you forgot? That's what I thought It must be a misunderstanding In any case, there's been some kind of ID-theft Unpleasant isn't it? You were in La Rochelle in may 1940 I believe This person too Anna Kuepfer Does this name ring a bell? Not the name, not the face I thought so I'm happy for you I have my doubts about her Not about you, on the other hand Married with 2 children The quiet life at Funoir Quite a job, how curious radio repair man Very well Please note it would have been benificial to have known you To spend a difficult time in the company of someone impeccable Gotta grab that with both hands Sorry to have bothered you for nothing This is silly... Now you are here... What's the harm... Bring her in just the same I can tell it says as little to you as the photo You may leave Mr Maroiyeur So you do know Anna Kuepfer Mr Maroiyeur Did she come back? Maybe you came back together Now everything becomes clear You join the Resistance you train together A quiet little family life A wife and kids, so virtuous A german mistress "open" for London You're in a bad way Mr Barbi?
