(ominous music) (electricity buzzing) (tinkling music) (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) (tense music) (speaking foreign language) (hammer bangs) (soft pop music) - Damn. (putty thuds) What the hell? - [Man] You patch that hol? - I'm working on it. - Oh yeah, that always does it. - Why's that? - I've worked this unit every year, and it's like clockwork. Tenants never stay long, and that hole is always there. (lighter clicks) - We can smoke in here? - No, Chad, I can smoke in. - Man. - Now listen. I did hear this story. That cavity in the wal? It's alive. It's waiting. It's hungry. And if you stare at that long enough, it becomes a glory hol. (both laughing) - Man, stop playing with me. - Listen. Sun's down, scrape out the damp, cover it with wallpaper, and I'm not paying overtim. - I need at least another hour. - No, we'll do it tomorrow. We need to drag this ot a few more days anyway. So just go home. You need a ride? - My girl's meeting me. - All right. Well, lock up before you leave, all right? - You got it, boss. (eerie music) Man, this is fucking bullshit. (ominous music) (tense music) (Chad gasps) What the fuck? (tense music) - Hey, Mister. Sorry I'm late. - Look who finally showed up. - And look what I brought. - Is that a four-pack? - Two might've disappeared on the way over here. - Yeah, sure. Thanks. - Oh, wow. - That's cool, right? - Hmm. - Okay. Wait, wait. I got something for it. (tense music) - You got that for me? - Yeah. Here, turn around. Let me see. - Hmm. Do you like? - I love. And you need another beer. (Chad laughs) (glass shatters) (tense music) (Lena groaning) - Lena? Baby, you okay? (dramatic music) Lena! Lena! Oh, fuck. Stay with me, stay with me. Look at me, look at me. Lena, baby, no, no, no, no. Help, somebody! Look at me, Lena. Please help! Oh, fuck! Okay, I'm gonna get help, okay, I'm gonna get help. (tense music) (solemn music) - You're making a huge mistake. - She's a bad influence on you. You step out that door, don't come back to us asking for help. - Kim! - Hey. - This place is lit, right? - So cool, I love the floor. - Where's your mom and dad? Still not a fan of mine, huh. - Not a fan of either of us right now. I'm just happy you're here with me. - I'm just happy to ride out your coattails when you become like, a famous journalist. Or if I make it before then, I'm gonna give yu an exclusive article on how fabulous I am. (both laughing) (women chattering) - Hi. - I like your hat, man. - I'm Ronan, the landlord. You're moving into room 203, right? - That's us, yeah. (woman chuckles) This is the same building, right? - This was an old commerce building. The bank was on the first , the other floors were converted to apartments during the Depression. We take first, last, plus damages, cash onl, for tenants like you with no credit. That's how it's done. There's no parking included. No smoking, no loud noise after nine p.m., no cats, no dogs, and the basement is off limits to residents. This is the last floor to be renovated in the building. The other units on this floor are empty, so it's just yours here that's available and mine back over there. All original pre-war furnishings. Utilities are included in the monthly. All furnishings are required to remain in the apartment. - Wow. Oh my... Yes! This'll do. This will do just fine. - It's better than the photos. Definitely vintage vibes. You concur? - I concur. (gentle music) Whoa. This is beyond. - It reminds me of that messed up play that you did freshman year. - "Murder at the Cathedral." - Don't touch that! This is an historic building, and under no circumstances can that be damaged. - Got it, dude. - Are we good here? (tense music) (both laughing) - Yay. (hammer tapping) (ominous music) (knocking on door) - Hey. - Hey. She said this was the only picture where her hair looked nice. - Her hair always looked good. - Yeah. (gentle music) - I call wheelbarrow. - No. - That was your mom's rules. Sad girl goes in the wheelbarrow. Wheelbarrow. (both chuckling) Let's go! (both laughing) Whoa! - Blood surging to my head. (both laughing) (head thuds) (gasps) - Sorry. Dang. Fuck, I'm dizzy. Oh, you know what I just remembered? - What? - It's a margarita Thursday. - That's not a thing. - Why? I just made it a thing. It's margarita Thursda. - I can't. I have orientation day the day after tomorrow.

(voicemail beeps) - Hey, it's me. I just want to let you know that we got all moved in and the place is really good. And I'm happy. Okay, I'm gonna try again tomorrow after my first day. Love you. - Hi. - Good morning. - I think I dreamt I peed on the roof last right. - Wait, no, I think you did pee on the roof last night. - Round two tonight, baby. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that 99% of college students go to orientation with a hangover. I think it's like a rite of passage. - If I even look at tequila tonight I'm gonna vomit. - Dude, just drink win. Ew! - I know, I tried to hang the mirror there last night, but the nail didn't hold. Found it on the floor this morning. Ew, it's fine. We'll just ask Ronan to fix it. - I think I see something. (tense music) - Izzy, don't, you know you're just gonna mess it up. - No, hold on. - Don't. - Oh no, it's fine. (Izzy gasps) (suspenseful music) - Izzy! (Izzy whimpering) (Izzy laughing) - You're kidding! You're... (sighs) Asshole. - I told you I was gonna be a superstar. My pictures everywhere and everyone knows my name. - Was that in the wall? - Yeah. - Let me see it. - Finders keepers. - Well, I don't want to ke. There's probably mold on it or something. - Oh, whatever. This is vintage, and Im the queen of vintage. - Mm-hmm, more like queen of tetanus. - That's a good one, actually. - Thank you. - Get ready, we're going out tonight. (ominous music) - Okay, so, your mom ad dad, wouldn't let you hang in high school, and then what? They disown you now, o? - They don't disown me. They're just really strict. - It's 'cause I went to rehab. - Oh. Damn, well... - Not for alcohol, you jackass. - Well, then for what? - None of your business, stranger. - My name is Steve. - Oh, well good for you, Steve. - Anyway, we're roommates now, and I start at the college tomorrow. - Okay, cool. All right, so you guys are going to college. That's cool. - Not me. - Well, what are you gonna do, then? - Oh, you know, just probably thinking I'm gonna drink a lot here. - She's an actress. - Thanks babe. - Man. You're so fucking so hot. - Don't. - What? - Dude, what are you doing? - Calm down, we're all just, we're hanging out here, right? Bitch. - Shit. (Izzy laughs) (Izzy laughing) (Izzy laughing) (tense music) I'm sorry, we'll be quieter. (door closes) (man sighing) - You know, I didn't tell you how much that punch turned me o. - You know, we could try something like that if you want, huh? You can slap me or... Look, we don't have to if you don't want, but... (Izzy snoring) Hey. (man sighing) Man, what the fuck? (izzy snoring) (eerie music) (man sighs) Holy shit. (Kim breathing heavily) What the fuck? (tense music) (bottle thuds) (zipper buzzes) (urine trickling) (tense music) (flesh squelches) (man gasps) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (door opens) (door closes) (floor creaking) (door opens) (solemn music) (Izzy snoring) - Morning, sunshine. (Kim groaning) It's orientation day. I told you I wouldn't fail you. (Kim sighs) - I heard some weird noises last night. - Oh dude, I didn't hear shit. And that guy must've left. What's his name? - Tony? - Tony! Dude, I totally forgot. But yeah. - How's your hand? - Oh, you know, it's all good. (Kim chuckles) - What time is it? - It's only 11. - Shit! - What? - God. Orientation already started. (tense music) No! (knocking on door) Excuse me? I'm here for the orientation. Please? - You're late. Orientation ended 15 minutes ago. I was giving the orientation tour, so in exchange for an extra hot non-fat sugar-free vanilla latte, I'll give you the exclusive Ian tour for one. - Really? That's your drink? - Yeah. - I'm kidding. You got a deal. - Need your name first. - Kim. - Ian. - I got that from the tour. - It's all about the web p. You'll access the live lectures, round tables there. Has its own social network. I'm not really giving you any gold here. You don't have to write it all down. What are you majoring in, anyway? - Journalism, but I want to minor in psych. - Nice. Yeah. I'm a junior now. I'm doing journalism too, but I'm focusing on video journalism. - Yeah? - Yeah. Just it's the future. Information's become democratized on the we. - Yeah. I think that's part of the problem, though. I mean, any idiot with an internet connection can take a video of themselves and call it news. - Touche. What about you? - Call me romantic, but I think there's something special about the written word. Like I... I don't know. I think there's something special about the process of real journalism, and it helps people. - I hate to break it to you, but that means you're gonna be taking a couple courses with Dr. Phillips. - Is that bad? - Dude is a complete ass. - He was must've given you a C. - C minus. (Kim laughing) So you came here for spring semester, and your friend came to pursue acting? - Yeah, but we just wanted to get away. I was being suffocated by my mom and dad. But Izzy... She was struggling aftr her mom passed away. So I wanted to help her, and it kinda helps me too. She's like family, so. - There's a story for Dr. Phillips' class right there. You could write about how you help a friend cope with loss, you know? Anyway, you're lucky to have a friend that's like family. - Yeah. It's cool. (chuckles) And we found this amazing apartment. I mean, it's amazing and creepy, kind of. But we can afford it, so. - I've actually got ths little protest today I'm gonna cover. (gentle music) See you on the portal. - Thanks for the in-person lesson on isolated education. (phone beeps) - Hey. Just getting back. Haven't heard from you. Gonna go to bed soon. (ominous music) Izzy? (door closes) Hey, what's with the smell? Izzy? (match strikes) (blows out match) (object clattering) (tinkling music) (keyboard clacking) Living... In the wake... Of an accidental overdose... Doesn't always feel like l. (solemn music) It's more like surviva. Like you've been kissed by death and the shadow that looms in the aftermath is a reminder that you're next. I watch helplessly as t stalks my best friend. It has come close. The shadow gave her a fistful of pills on a beautiful of Fourth of July. But the subsequent fireworks that burst inside her didn't finish the job. She refuses the call to the other side, but... The shadow is patient. (mysterious music) (Kim sighs) (paper rattling) (suspenseful music) (Kim breathing heavily) What the fuck? (slow, heavy banging on door) (tense music) (suspenseful music) Izzy. What are you doing? (tinkling music) (ominous music) (gasps) Izzy! Hey, wake up. Wake up, Izzy, please? I'm here. It's okay. - She's still with us. (tinkling music) I can feel her. - Shh. (music box closes) (ominous music) (solemn music) (tools clattering) (Kim sighing) Well, I had two visitors last night. An imaginary bird, then you. - Was the bird cute? Was I cute? I'm sorry, Kim. I put the two and two together when I woke up in your bed. But I don't remember anything. - Izzy, last- - You liked your smoothie, right? - I like my sleep more. - I used to sleep walk when I was a kid. It'll stop. And if it doesn't, you won't even know, 'cause I installed a lock. (liquid pouring) - So what were you up to last night? - I've met someone. - Hmm. What's his name? - Her name. - Congratulations? - Sandy. Her name is Sandy, and I met her last night at the bar. She is a casting assistant to this lady. And guess what? She's getting me an audition for this TV show that she's doing. - Congratulations! (Izzy laughing) - When I get the part, taking you to your first strip club. - Mm-mm. - Mm-hmm. (both laughing) - I was gonna tell you about it last night, but I met someone too, a guy. Ian. And I like him. I think I'm gonna let him take me on a date. - What?! - Oh, are you okay? - Yeah, sorry. My cramps are really kicking my ass today. - Okay. There's aspirin in the cabinet over the stove. Drink more water, less tequila. - Whatever. - The SPJ code of ethics is a great place to start. You should always run through the checklist to ensure that you are delivering your content in a way that you're both proud of and that will stand up to scrutiny. My office hours are available as usual. Thank you, everyone. - Excuse me, Dr. Phillips? - Yes. - Yeah, I just... I wanted to ask a questiont my personal experiences ar, because what I'm writing about isn't technically about me, it's about my friend and her personal experiences, some difficult situations and how I've seen it affect her. And I think it'd be important for me too, just be cathartic. I'm not gonna say her name or anything, but I was wondering if youk I need to get her permission. - You should act independently here. As long as you aren't putting her in any danger or betraying her trust. - Yeah, I just feel it's important. I don't think she'd understand right now what I'm trying to do with it. - As long as you leave her anonymous, I think you'll be fine. Good luck. - Thank you, Doctor. (computer beeps) I was just getting some help from the professo. - So the audition's today, and then Sandy's taking me out for drinks after. - Casting couch. Nice. - Please. You should go see that boy. Give your mom and dad a big fuck you by fucking him. (Kim chuckles) (ominous music) - All right, I'll see you . - Good luck, love you. - Love you! (gentle music) (hammer tapping) - Stay. (Kim laughs) So then she punched this guy in the face. (laughs) I think he was knocked out. - Remind me not to piss Izzy off. She sounds cool, I just don't want to go down like that. (Kim laughing) How'd her mom pass awa? Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. Sorry, it's the journalism thing, it's ruined my social etiq. - No, no, it's fine. She just... It was an overdose. And the thing about it was I think she was the happiest person that I. I mean, I loved Leanna, and I had just no idea that that's wht she was going through. And I think she was going through that and she was just this light in our lives, then what does that mean for the rest of u? - Sorry. Just can't imagine. - It crushed Izzy. The worst part about it is that I let my parents run my life. They wouldn't let me over there to see her. They thought I'd overdose by osmosis or something. So I couldn't go to the fu. When she needed me most, she called me and asked me to be there, I didn't show u. And then the next thing that I heard, she was in the hospita. She tried to... She took a bunch of pills. So. I just promised myself that I would always be there for her. Sorry. - Don't apologize. Come on. I'll take you for a ride. - You don't have a car. - Yeah, I know. When's the last time you rode on a pair of handlebars? (Kim laughs) (Kim laughing) This is better than a car, right? - It's kinda scary! - I know. - How fast are we goin? - Fast! Five miles per hour. (Kim laughing) - Woohoo! (laughing) Woo! - You almost got me killed. - You almost got you killed. - I'd invite myself up, but actually really sweaty now. - Good, 'cause I would've said no. Go shower. - Can I see you again? - Uh-huh. (laughing) (door closing) (gentle music) (mysterious music) (door closes) (keyboard clacking) - [Samuel] Hello, you've reached Samuel and Anne White, please leave us a message after the tone. (voicemail beeps) - Hi, it's me again. I just want to tell you how it's going here. I like my classes. We're doing good. I guess call me back if you have time, or want to talk, (glass shattering) Shit! Oh... (Kim sighs) (eerie music) (door opens) (door closes) - I had a really good time with you today. I really wanna kiss yo. - Yeah? Well why don't you do it? (glass crunches) (Kim grunts) (eerie music) (tinkling music) (tinkling music) - Izzy? (tinkling music) Izzy? Hey. Are you okay? Are you awake? (metal crunches) It's me, Kimmy. Izzy? (Izzy screaming) Hey, are you... (tense music) (Kim gasps) Izzy, wait. (door closes) (elevator beeps) Fuck. (groans) (door opens) (door closes) (mysterious music) Izzy? Izzy, please? It's me. Izzy, please. Please, where are you? Izzy? (tense music) (Kim gasps) (person choking) (tinkling music) Izzy? (person choking) Izzy, where are you going? Izzy, wait! (door closes) (tense music) (tinkling music) (ominous music) Hey. Hey. Izzy. It's okay. It's all right, Izzy. You're gonna be safe. Okay. You're gonna be all right. Shh. (suspenseful music) (Izzy groaning) (urine trickling) (solemn music) I'm here. I'm here. - I don't understand. - It's okay. I think you just need to stay in bed. You need rest. And please don't drink. I don't know what that was last night, but it scared me. - I'm not gonna drink. I have a call back today. - Drink this. - My head really hurts. - I think it might just be stress. Can you see a doctor? - I don't have insurance. And like, I don't know, but they're not gonna let me take sleeping pills. - No, that's not what I was saying. I don't want that. - Do you ever feel like you're watching your dreams, but you're not part of them? - No. - Well, that's what it felt like. (solemn music) - [Kim] I feel like I'm talking crazy. - No, no, you're not. This is real. You weren't sleepwalking, you were awake. - Well, what do I do? I need to do something. - Dig. - What? - Dig. Research, investigate. That's what we're supposed to do, right? There's always an answer, you just have to dig. - Right. Yeah. - Just can't judge what we. - We? - You'll need like a research assistant. - Will you come to the apartment with me? - Finally, you're inviting me up. - Just don't talk to hr about it though, pleas. I just want you to see the place first. Maybe there's like radon poisoning happening or something. - I don't think radon makes you sleepwalk yourself down to the basement. - What the hell? (ominous music) - Is she gone? - I don't know. (dramatic music) - Can I help you? - Do you know this guy? - [Kim] He's my landlord. - I came to treat the glass. - Oh, okay. Can you let me know in advance when you're gonna be coming into the apartment? - You went down to the bas. The basement is off limits to residents. Don't go down there. - Your landlord's kind of a dick. - Yeah. (door closes) - This thing is horrifying. You ever seen stained glass like this? - No. - Me neither. (camera clicking) - Last night Izzy was just staring at it. It was weird. It was like she was hypnotized or somethin. - That symbol is weird. It looks like kinda Irish or Celtic or something. - Hmm. - What else? - What else what? - You said she was holding a music box? - Yeah, I found it in that little cabinet over there. All the stuff is just like stuff left behind. - From other renters or what? - I think so. I don't know. One second. (laughs) - [Ian] Look at these. This is the music box? - Yeah. - It's not making any music sounds. - It was last night. I'm not crazy, it was, I swear. - To my dearest Karen, always yours, L.M.. (door closes) - Hey, I'm Ian. - Hey. - How's your call back? - Sandy didn't even show up, so I guess it kinda just went like that. - I'm sorry, hon. I'm sure it went better than you think it did. And there's always gonna be more. - There is gonna be more. I get another chance to get rejected tomorrow. So. - My sister's an actress. They made her be the spoon in "Beauty and the Beast." - Spoon. That's great. - Sorry. (camera clicking) Why don't you cover that up? - I tried. - Smells kinda weird. - I know. And the necklace that Izzy found was in ther. - What? Out of the hole? - Yeah. She just reached her hand in there and found it. - Okay, but that's gross. Does Izzy eat gum off the sidewalk too? - Shut up. No, no, really, that's fucking crazy. Why would that be in there? Why would you wear it? Okay. Moving on. All right. I'll look into anything I can find on the window. You look into the apartment. (solemn music) (zipper buzzing) (keyboard clacking) Okay, this is definitey a Celtic mark, it's called a triskele. It's like a druid pagan symbol. - Hmm. Liam McNally. Look at this. It's Karen. It's the name from the music box. - L.M.. That's crazy. That's their music box, right? - It has to be. (keyboard clacking) - Damn. Look at this. - "Bank manager murders pregnant wife." Jesus. Milton Briggs. (keyboards clacking) "He was last known to be in his apartment..." 203. They all lived in this apartment? - I don't know, some of the articles don't say. (solemn music) (Kim chuckling) (tense music) (Izzy breathing heavil) (eerie chanting) (tense music) (Izzy panting) (woman whispering foreign language) (Izzy panting) (woman whispering foreign language) (Izzy gasping) (Izzy hyperventilating) (voices whispering indisti) (Izzy gasps) (woman whispering foreign language) (ominous music) (paper rustling) (Kim sighs) (paper rustling) (suspenseful music) (bird caws) - What happened? Are you okay? - There was this bird, there was a fucking bid and it flew at me. (tense music) - It's just a dream, all right? It's okay. (mysterious music) (door closes) - Can I help you with some? - Excuse me. Are you Kim White? - I'm her roommate. - Okay, great. Here. - Thank you. (door closes) Kim? Kim, I got your paper. Oh, fuck. (solemn music) (doors open) (doors close) (phone beeps) - I'm just here in St. Mark's Cathedral. As a lifelong atheist, I don't have much experience with stained glass windows, so I wanted to see these in person, make some comparisons between the windows in the church and the stained glass window in Kim's apartment at the commerce building. So far, what I'm seeing here are depictions of religious events, you know, probably biblical symbolism. Or they're totally decorative. Either way, the tone is about reverence. They're generally uplifting, and generally pretty. In contrast to the window in room 203, I don't see any maker's marks or symbols that appear to be Celtic. (phone beeps) (tense music) (mysterious music) (door opens) (car door closes) (solemn music) (knocking on door) (door opening) - Hi. Can I help you? - Hi. Are, are you Milton Briggs? - When I can remember my own name I am. Did I forget to pay a bill or something? - No, no, nothing like that. I go to college here and I'm actually doing some research for an article, and I was just wondering if I could talk to you for five minutes about Liam and Karen McNally and the night that they died. - Why would you want to write an article about that? They've already wrote everything there is to say already. - I just wanted to hear it from you. - I haven't had to talk about that in about 50 years. I don't want to dredge up the past. - Please. Five minutes. I live in that same apartment, and I just need to know. - You live in room 203. - Yes. - That night I was working the graveyard, and I heard some footsteps. I figured it was Larry, the other janitor, had come back 'cause he had forgot his keys, but then I heard more footsteps, and crying. So I stepped out to see what was happening. And that's when I saw him. Chasing his wife into the boiler room. - Who? - Mr. McNally. (tense music) He was after his wife. And she was screaming. So I ran after them and chased them into the boiler room, and that's when I saw the . - Blood on who? - Mrs. McNally. She was clutching her stomach and crying out. It was everywhere. And then the crying stopped. And I just froze. I've never been so ashamed of anything in my life. I stood there, and when he got up, he just walked right past me. He had a look in his eyes I'd never seen in a man. It was like I wasn't even . Like I was a ghost. I felt like I floated Mrs. McNally. I just wanted to stop the bleeding. All of a sudden, I heard a gunshot. - He shot himself? - I guess. I couldn't think of what that was. My mind just wasn't ready for it yet. At that point, all I could hear was the baby crying. - What? The baby survived? - He did. A little boy. - What happened to him? - Nobody told me. I went into shock. And I've never stepped foot in that building again. (solemn music) - Hey. - Hey Kimmy. - Where are you going? - Out. - Can you stay for a few minutes, please? I need to talk to you. - I've got plans, kid. - Izzy... - Wanna talk about thi? This whole fucking thing is about me. My life. - Izzy, I'm sorry, oka? I didn't say your name and I kept it anonymou. I was just trying to help. - Help who? Yourself. - No, no... I was trying to- - You didn't have to say my name. It's obvious who you're talking about. You took my tragedy, ripped it open, and put it on the page. Congratulations. You made me your guinea pig just so you can get a fuckin' A? - No, please, Izzy, don't, it wasn't like that, okay? I need you to listen to me now because it's really important. - Like I needed you. I buried my mom. Where the fuck were yo? (solemn music) - Izzy, I'm sorry. - No. - No, I am sorry! - No, no, no, no, no, no! If you were there, you wouldn't have had to write this fucking paper just to make yourself feel better. I mean, did you even ask yourself why I was so fucked up after? Bro, you were the only family left. And you left. - Izzy, I'm sorry. I am, I'm sorry, Izzy, please stay. - I just wanted you to fight for me. - Izzy, please. (Kim crying) (door opens) (door slams) - Druids worshiped Pagan gods. (tense music) "Goddess of revenge, war, . Known as 'fury.'" Often takes the form of a crow. (tense music) The mark of the Morrig. (Kim panting) (suspenseful music) (Kim grunting) (banging on wall) (dramatic music) (Kim hyperventilating) (dramatic music) (door closes) Kim. Okay, just the facts, and the facts are weir. I found something on the stained glass windw in your apartment. I was researching... Anyway, whatever. I just need to tell you about it as soon as possible. And maybe you shouldn't be there right now. If you are there. Okay. Call me back as soon as you get this. I'm coming over. (ominous music) (door closes) (Kim breathing heavily) (Kim whimpering) - That was the last picture taken of my parents. Do you recognize anything? (Kim crying) My mother's necklace. Morrigu chooses who wears it next. She's with her now. And she needs to feed. (Kim crying) feed her children. If I don't satisfy the crows soon, she's going to come after me. Like she did my mother and my father. Normally, it would be done by now. But your friend is fighting it. The others were quicke. I'm telling you this... Because you're about to join them in the walls. (suspenseful music) (Kim grunting) (elevator beeping) (muffled shouting and banging) (knocking on door) - Hello? (door closes) Kim? (tense music) Shit! Oh, shit. (window creaking) (heavy breathing) (bird caws) (tense music) (suspenseful music) Izzy, Jesus. - Ian, right? - Yeah. Is Kim here? Do you know where she is? - She'll be back. For now you can sit here... And wait. - Kim's... - Shh. (ominous music) (muffled screaming) - I don't have a choic! (muffled screaming) Morrigu has been trapped in the glass for centuries. She's a part of my family. I found my father's journal. He taught me about the curse. He taught me how she feeds. How the souls she takes leave a totem and allow her to cross into our realm.
