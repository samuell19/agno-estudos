♪ Coming. Hello. May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please? Thank you. ♪ This is Pablo Ferro. ♪ Pablo who? Who is Pablo Ferro? Kind of a wild eyed romantic artist. Very bohemian. Gypsy, I had the feeling he was a bit of a gypsy. This...this is a pipe. He's a red scarf. He's really the 60s. A leprechaun. He's Yoda. New pattern. Just a little askew of the center. He's surprising. And he's also just your average guy. He's ephemera man, he's a miasmic. He's an optical illusion man. You ain't gonna pin point the boy. This is a garage. Sort of frail, intense guy who wanted to make art. This is the bomb. A very gentle, loving guy. This is right after Castro took over. That's why I was surprised when I heard about some violence having to do with him in New York. This is a sauna. The image of Pablo... To see him, he's like a walking work of art, you know. This is the cloud. Is it going to rain? This is the Art Director's Club, and that comes apart. The D and the A. This is Stanley Kubrick. This is Stanley Kubrick. There's a kind of liberation. Anything works with Pablo. This is the video cutting room and art department. All the art work and research. And here is the Napoleon Dynamite. The original drawing. Did you do that of yourself? Yes. A portrait. Yeah, a caricature. He doesn't have any opinions about people. He likes everybody. Everybody's got his story, and that's fine by Pablo. These are naked girls. Are two better than one? Something about the essence of Pablo Ferro. He has a kind of revolutionary feel to him. He's like certain shamans, you know. When you evoke his name, there's a kind of energy and a humor, and a good will. He's a true artist. This is a phone. Is it going to ring? They're going to try to do a little documentary on me. So, I hope that it will come out interesting. ♪ Get the thing going, man. ♪ A title sequence, which he's done so many of, can really set the tone for a movie. Of course, the positioning of the credits in a movie is huge because it's the first thing you see. Just like meeting people, it's a first impression. He's one of the very few who've worked in his particular matai, which is titles who receives credit for their titles. Big tribute is going on tonight for Hollywood movie master by the name of Pablo Ferro. You may not know the name, but I bet you know the work. Been in the movie theater in the past 40 years, you've seen Pablo Ferro's work. Have you ever walked out of a movie and wondered why you liked the opening title sequence better than the film itself? The designer of trailers and opening credit sequences, his work is often more memorable than the film itself. How can you say don't worry about it when every single image including the title and the way the title is presented begins to have an effect. Neutral is negative. If it's just okay, "Oh, it didn't hurt anything, we're just getting it," then it's negative. I'm convinced to that. One time I was accused of subliminate advertising. They would say, "Pablo, I'm sure somewhere in there, there's a frame that says, Hire Pablo, hire Pablo." Pablo, thank you so much for being here. My pleasure. This is Pablo Ferro arriving on the scene. I love your stuff, Pablo. It's just a great look. It's great. It happened by accident. A friend of mine back in the 60s did one for me. Oh, so you just like, it's like your signature. Yeah, and became, I'd be wearing it all the time, and all of sudden he says, "Oh, is that your sash?" I said, "I guess so." Well, it's a classi-- See it never dates when you do something like this. You can wear it every season. Yeah. Every decade, and it's a classic. It's fine, everybody likes it when they see it. Yeah. You don't bump into those people that are distinguished themselves from that area. You know, he was a... he was a star. He was a superstar in that area. Pablo Ferro. Thank you. He's one of those guys that has a kind of a legendary aspect. Give it to Pablo, leave him alone for two weeks, he'll come up with something. And he does a lot of different things as you know. Commercials, acting, films, trailers, graphics, whatever you want. Plus he's funny... to me anyway. I think so. Probably his most important contribution to any film he works on is just the fact that he's there. I think that it has to do with the God given gift of talent combined with the kind of hard work that goes into making something look easy. This is Cuba. ♪ Okay, let's see, what can I tell you? I was born in a small village in Cuba called Antilla in 1935. Everywhere I went I drew pictures. Always drawing pictures. Life was good. But that always changes, right? We're talking about, it was Batista was in, and it was just, you know, my father being a student and being rebellious. He was involved in that type of politics. But sometimes, you know, they don't like you to voice opinions. So, if he didn't leave Cuba, I think they would have put him in jail or done away with him. ♪ This is Pablo Ferro leaving Cuba. Could you think I wanted to leave Cuba? I had no choice. ♪ My father went first, then we followed. All six of us. This is Pablo Ferro arriving in America. I never saw snow, so when I saw it, I said, "What the hell is this?" Somebody like that came over from Cuba when he was 12 years old and never wore shoes before he came over. That is to say we know very few people who lived in the country with no plumbing until they were 12 years old and then came to New York City and was able to sustain himself. My father, he'd sit down and he'd have his daily drink and then my poor mother would come change into her house dress and then she'd start dinner because God forbid, you know, in those days your husband would help the wife that way. I saw how demanding and how unappreciative the rest of the men were in the family. But Pablo was very thoughtful. He always considered your feelings. After two years of living in America my father left us. I said, "Pendejo," and that was it. He was gone. This is Pablo Ferro becoming the man of the house. My other brother was in the service and Pablo was the sole provider for us. Even though my mother still worked, he worked. My dad wasn't there. ♪ I'm always looking for more work to help support the family. One day I run into this cinema, this art cinema. And they offered me a job as an usher. And I said sure. It was great because I was able to see the masters. This is Pablo Ferro discovering cinema. It was a foreign film movie theater. They only showed foreign. And every two weeks, there'd be a new billing. I would watch the same film over and over. I really loved it. There's a film that is really good. The best Vittorio De Sica. It was called Miracle in Milan. Here he deals with fantasy and reality at the same time. The film opens with this old lady living by herself when she found this baby. And then she brought the baby up and taught him how to be a nice person. He's like an angel. And he would always be saying bongiorno, good morning. He likes people. People would say, "What's so good about it?" At the end he asks everybody to grab a broom. And they get on and he starts to fly away. And they're flying away and they have a song and it says, "We're going to a land where good morning means good morning." And that's the way it ends. And it's beautiful, beautiful film. You really could relate to it. ♪ I saved some money. I got myself an animation book. I taught myself how to become an animator. Now, the manager of the theater figured out that I knew how to draw. He said, "Oh, I want some sketches promoting the outside, so people would come in." Well, I did one that I like. It was Bitter Rice, where legs are spread and it's wearing those mini cut things like that. So, I took the picture and blew it up. And then this part was in the box office. So, when you buy a ticket, you buy it through the legs. And they loved it. We sold a lot of tickets. ♪ This is Pablo Ferro getting paid money. And this is a sauna. Okay, take some deep breaths. You can relax now, just normal breathing. Pablo generally has a real difficult time during the winters. Usually the cold weather makes the pain a lot worse. There tends to be more inflammation. He gets gets a lot of all the muscular problems. Muscle tension, muscle spasm. It's just the heat from the sauna helps the muscles somewhat relax, and the end result is, well, a little less pain. You used to get a massage in the past, right? Yeah. On a regular basis? Not now, I can't afford it anymore. How about the sauna? ♪ This is Pablo Ferro's doctor suggesting a sauna. I got to get a, I got to get a big job to get the sauna. A big job for that. They always talk. What about talking? Yeah. Well, I'm looking at a strip now called Alley Ugh. And it's a very distinctive style. It's somebody who has a good sense of humor, and also a sense of drama. It's laid out very well. The story telling is good. And it doesn't look like the average strip. The artist who drew this had his own recognizable, individualistic style. Obviously Pablo Ferro. That's what I brought over the Stan Lee to see if he'd want to publish it. When I showed him the portfolio and he says, "Did you ink that?" I said, "Yeah, I inked it and I drew it, and I wrote it" And he said, "Okay, you're hired." And I got hired in the industry that way. It was one of the few industries where your age didn't matter, your religion didn't matter, the color of your skin didn't matter, your nationality, all that we would do was look at the artwork. And, "Hey, that looks good, you're hired. Here's a strip to do" ♪ That was unusual. Most of the artists in comics stayed with the comics most of their lives. The fact that Pablo was able to go from comic book art to directing commercials, that was a tribute to Pablo's talent. ♪ Welcome to a brief lesson in the history of TV commercials. This is a television. A television commercial is an advertisement in which goods, services, organizations, or ideas are promoted via the medium of television. The first television commercial was aired in 1941 by Bulova Watch Company. It displayed a Bulova watch over a map of the United States and the narrator announcing, "America runs on Bulova time." This is an average 1950's commercial. I think we all agree on Sugar Smacks. Right. It wasn't effectively positioning its client in the market place. Folks, don't wait, get Kellogg's new Sugar Smacks, candy sweet. ♪ This is Pablo Ferro's contribution. ♪ Tempo frozen garden peas. ♪ Tempo. Widely considered the new standard on Madison Avenue. Beech-Nut delightedly announces. Good old fashion sourball flavor is back. He brought the comic book sensibility to the TV screen. The commercials that he did were as imaginative and as colorful and as fun to look at as his illustrations in the comics. ♪ What Pablo was doing was injecting graphic design, graphic design techniques or comic book techniques onto film. ♪ Pablo is a precursor of what's going on now in motion graphics. ♪ He was the quintessential, experimental and exploratory director, you know. His sense of humor, or his sense of the absurd were very special. This is a time consuming detail. The kind that could eat up hours of a state fund agent's time. Animation teaches you patience when you can work things out. Pardon me, sir. How are you going to send your children to college? It's all taken care of. Teaches you about the flow. What works, what doesn't work, in that image. Oh, where is my County Fair bread? Hold out for County Fair bread. I started treating live action and graphic like it was animation. And I could cut the little pieces together to just get the right action. Pablo was on the leading edge of the fast paced, quick cut cacophony of images. He was there and he was on that wave. I was able to put graphic lettering, live action, stills all together into one film. But I had to cut them short. I made all the scenes shorter, but a longer scene would be a frame. When you're young it's like everyone wants to change you. He believed that people could absorb and retain information, either visual information or written information told in this machine gun style. If it's anything to do with fabric, we do it at Burlington Industries. And we do more of it than anyone in the world. He was doing things that I wasn't aware he was the first one to do. I mean, things that had a huge effect afterwards, things that we take for granted now. He began working at a studio called Electra, which was a very high design studio. And then he was in business with Freddy and then with Lou Schwartz. He just had a knack for it. I would say it was a quick rise to stardom there for Pablo. ♪ We would go to these... There was a couple of belly dancer places over on the Eighth Avenue somewhere. And Pablo would be buying a round, you know, "Buy a round for the bar, you know, for the band. Buy a round here." And he really splurged a lot. We used to call him, Bucks. Then the things got bad. Then we started to call him Pennies, ha-ha-ha! ♪ We met at a party that Pablo had been invited to. And Pablo asked who I was. And Jimmy, my husband told him that I was his sister. That Jimmy was--I was Jimmy's sister. So, Pablo came into a very different state of mind. This is Pablo Ferro falling in love. ♪ And I was pregnant with Allen. Pablo suddenly would be making excuses for not wanting to join us or come over. And I was very upset about it. You know, maybe in the back of my mind I wanted to have a break with Jimmy because I was really looking at Pablo differently. I was beginning to realize that he was more important to me than just a friend. And I left him, I left Jimmy. ♪ Pablo said, "Why don't we get married?" And I said, "What?" It seemed like a great idea to me. We got married in Cuba, and then when we came back, not only was I divorced, I was married. And for my mother... I can not tell you. I just was so thrilled and happy. I felt like I was breaking out of an egg and the sun was shining. This is the bomb. The '60s were filled with anxiety and filled with seeds of revolution, in a way. You'll have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes. Everybody was frightened of a nuclear war between Russia and America. You duck, then you cover. Everybody was living in a state of paranoid fear. There are two kinds of attack. With warning and without any warning. It was difficult times. ♪ Kennedy for me ♪ Kennedy, Kennedy ♪ Kennedy, Kennedy ♪ And this handsome man, this beautiful woman, this perfect family. As charismatic as he was, you know, on screen and TV and all of that, when you saw him in person it was electrifying. Seemed to be only talking to you. There was a personal connection, yet he was making that connection with millions and millions of people. You know, this is our time. This is it. He represents us and all the possibilities, all the possibilities. President Kennedy died at 1:00 PM central standard time. Two o'clock eastern standard time. And when that happened, it just was a heart break. It was a heart break. And it hardened you for a long time after that. It made for those cynical times. It made for that drug culture. It made for all of that. The ground shifted, it shifted. ♪ So, my agent got a call from Stanley Kubrick, who was working on the film about the end of the world. Some sort of a comedy. He saw my reel and he wanted me to do his trailer even though I have never done a trailer before. This is Stanley Kubrick. Yeah, he hired me before I got there. He says, "I want that person, I want that person to do this job." Let me talk to him and see what he wants. He knew about me, he knew about my work. He did good research. And I didn't know anything about him. He always took us with him. We traveled a lot. He was just absolutely the best fun. It was very exciting. I think it was just... He was just very, very cool. Really, a real pro, and yet, he has real talent. Welcome to a brief lesson in the history of trailers. A trailer is an advertisement for a film about to be released. The first trailer was projected in 1911 when the following 18 words flickered on screen for 15 seconds. ♪ This is an average 1950's trailer. Yes, it came from outer space to bring you unforgettable suspense. Aaah! Who are the all powerful creatures it brought from outer space? And what did they want on Earth? Not effectively positioning the film in the market place. And this is Pablo Ferro's contribution. Widely considered the first trailer of contemporary times. Attack. Russia. ♪ Oh, oh. ♪ Ten females to each male. Every now and then somebody will come along with something fresh and different. Hitchcock did his own trailers. And in this house the most dire horrible events took place. And they're distinctive. And they were very much taking advantage of his public persona. A split second off timing and... Cecile B. Demille did the same thing, and he had a large public persona. No, it's not make believe. And of course Orson Welles made a classic and famous trailer for his first film, Citizen Kane. How do you do, ladies and gentlemen. This is Orson Welles. But those were the exceptions to the rule. When Dr. Strangelove's trailer came along, no one had ever seen anything like it. It was sending a very loud signal to the audience. This movie's different. We're showing you a commercial for it that's utterly contemporary and completely different. Perfect match. ♪ We sold a lot of tickets. And a theater in Texas made an ad out of it saying, "Come and see the wildest trailer that was ever made." ♪ Perhaps if they went to see experimental films at the Museum of Modern Art or an Avant-garde film festival, maybe they would have seen something that approached that technique. Where's the bathroom? Dr. Strangelove. But even there they might not have seen what he pulled off in that trailer. Love the bomb. A moving picture. When I finished the trailer, Stanley asked me to stay on a little longer to set up the movie with an opening title sequence. To be the ultimate weapon, a doomsday device. We were having a conversation and then he asked what I thought about human beings. And I said everything the humans invent is always very sexual. All the machinery, it's always like that. We looked at each other and said B52 refueling in mid air, of course. So, that's when I got the idea to do the tall lettering. Together it worked. You were able to see the lettering and the plane at the same time. It set the tone for the film, so that people weren't afraid. Is it a black comedy? Are we allowed to laugh? Which is a big thing that's right in the front of Strangelove. Seeing those two airplanes and saying, "I think this is funny." They were so crude and so child-like, yet so sophisticated. ♪ Dr. Strangelove was immediately celebrated by critics, by a lot of members of the audience, by many social commentators. As we learned years later, even by some members of the American government. It was a brilliant, and remains a brilliant black comedy. And Kubrick, a master filmmaker at his very best. At the height of his power. To Pablo, he was Kubrick's guy. This creative odd fellow that we'd never seen anything like it. ♪ Pablo Ferro was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame in 2000. An art director, first of all has taste, an educated taste. ♪ An art director may not take the photograph, he may not do the drawing, he may not write the copy, but he knows how to put it all together into a compelling visual statement. ♪ The first real superstar was Saul Bass, and that was someone who did brilliant opening credits and whose name became so identified with high quality movies that it was considered a plus up front, in a movie. ♪ It's a very small group of geniuses that are known for their brilliant title design. ♪ You can see that the title design is so major a part of the creative ingredients going into that film. Even the choice of graphics, the choice of type face, the boldness of the presentation. ♪ All of that puts you in the right frame of mind if it's doing its job, for the movie to follow. Pablo seemed to be tremendously in touch with the changing times and tastes in the 1960s. He's associated with key films that really speak for their time, speak for their era. "Dr. Strangelove" would be one. "The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming", which was the first time that he worked with Norman Jewison. I was trying to make a film which was a political satire. It be like making "The Arabs Are Coming" today. And so, we brought Pablo out to California. We discussed for a long time about how we could open the film. We sat and talked and I said, "What if we use a musical opening?" Yankee Doodle Comes to Town. And put against that the Red Army chorus. And if we put that against, Yun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. So, we started to play with music. And Pablo came up with the idea that maybe we could have two flags. And all of a sudden things started to work. He worked for months on his little film. He never regarded it as titles, it was his little film. It's quite brilliant. He was doing "The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming" when he met my good friend Hal, and he became a friend for life. They were both so passionate, so committed to film, they would sit for hours and hours and hours experimenting with film and cutting it and smoke a little. And it became a very close relationship. They were bonded very deeply. Hal Ashby was tremendously artistic, creative, passionate filmmaker who was able to channel his work into the mainstream. His ongoing collaboration with Pablo was one of the great little passages in American cinema. Hal looked like a hippy. He had long hair and a beard, and wore hippy clothes, and this is in the 60s, that's when there were hippies and there were straight people. And Pablo and Hal, the two of them walking down the old Goldman lot was quite a site because Hal with his beads and long hair and beard, and Pablo who looked like he just kinda stepped off of a nickel. It was an interesting sight. They were very similar in their ethos. Very compassionate people. I think it has to do with the soul of the artist. I think true artists are out to help each other. Pablo and Hal were on the same wavelength in so many ways. They enjoyed life in the same way. They just...they got the 60s in the same way. They were of the same type of personality, you know, which is not too many people were on that frequency. And they probably still are even though Hal's no longer with us, you know. "Russians Are Coming" became a great success. And it was shown the first time in Washington. I was really nervous because we were showing it for the Vice President of the United States, and a huge gathering of diplomats from all over the world. And senators and congressmen and Supreme Court judges, and I thought, "What's gonna happen when they see what Pablo has done? When the Communist flag fills the screen. And what's gonna happen?" And you know something, they got it. They started to applaud the titles. He wasn't essentially political, but he saw the red in both flags. Yeah, absolutely. Susan and I decided to have a child together. We named her Joy. She was the most beautiful girl. As a father, I think that for the most part he was just too young. So, there really couldn't be much, you know, of-- of--of a--of a real father as we would perceive real fathers to be in a traditional sense. "I want you to go up and clean your room, and then do your homework, and then come down and have dinner." You know, that's...you know, that wasn't my father. So, it's your birthday, you want to go to the beach? Okay. Get on an airplane, go to the Bahamas. That's my father. Allen, come over here. Come over here. Come here. When you're young and you've got your kids, and when you're married, you want them to be always there, which really wasn't possible. There were other people who were vying for his attention. And I just didn't feel equal to that. I didn't know how to-- Didn't know how to handle it. His life was going in a separate direction. I think it was, it was like values. Like how do you want to live your life everyday? Do you want to be on a 9-5 job and come home and... Or do you want to be out with different artists and free forming? So, it wasn't like, probably what Susan had expected a marriage to be like. And then she pulled against that. She claimed that since I was working with actresses, I was doing things. I said, "I don't have the energy to begin with. I'm very happy at home. That's enough for me." During that time there were a lot of drugs and sex, which was really very commonplace. And I think that somewhere along the line, he was enticed into that, and I could not follow. It was right after we had our little Joy. At that point he wanted me to join in, and there was no way. I went to a hypnotist to have the hypnotist take away the aversion that I had, you know, towards that. And I know for a fact, nobody can hypnotize you into do something that you really don't want to do. No way. It's got to be a seed in there, otherwise it won't take. That's when I...that's when I felt I got to draw the line. That's when I said, you know, God if you help me, I'll leave him. ♪ When I did, he never ever expected that. And it was very hurtful to him. I think it just knocked the real foundation off of him. ♪ It was devastating to me. It broke my heart and it's been a big issue in my entire life, if you want to really know the truth. He would often on come in and out of our lives. He inwardly really desired that family that he could never, he didn't understand that the business was not going to allow him. As a star, he would not be allowed. He's expressed to me many times how he's cared for her. He will never be able to reconcile that. And that's just the fix. Don't deal with it and it's gone away. You make mistakes, some of them you can't repair. But time has a way of at least healing them somewhat. It was going great all that time till she said, no. And went, "Wow." And I still don't understand. So, I moved out. ♪ I think what happened was the '60s opened up, and suddenly he wanted more. He wanted his life to be more open. She wanted family and he wanted a little whoop-dee-doo in his life. A little more excitement. And why not? This...this is a pipe. And this is Pablo Ferro scoring pot. The thing about drugs is it opens you wide up. Your perspective changes, you know. These guys are living proof that it certainly worked for the art world. It would've been very different if they weren't doing this. They wouldn't have been who they were. You never get an obvious, anything obvious or anything borrowed. It would always be fresh. And you never knew where he was going to take it. ...devilishly ingenious scheme work? Will Angel's kinky miniskirts prove too distracting? See "Kaleidoscope". Sometimes he would spend three or four days on one little word in a title sequence that it just didn't flow right, or the crawl wasn't right, or the way the images moved, you know. Like insects he's studying them. They're pulsating even though they're credits, or a trailer, or montage. To him they're alive. You know? ♪ I looked around and ended up finding this loft in the east village. It was cheap with a lot of space, and I thought, "Yeah, I'm going to move in here!" That was on Second Avenue and 12th Street and another piece of his genius. Well, when you walked in, it was like a long hallway, and you saw these posters of JoJo The Dog Faced Boy and... Old circus posters. The Monkey Man. Mona the Monkey Faced Girl. ♪ There was no time in Pablo's apartment. Sometimes you would just be there for days. ♪ This was never, never land, man. You kinda knew an artist lived here. It had to be an artist or somebody very strange. He had secret, little stairways, and compartments, and it was wild. I guess something in his mind figured, "Wait a minute!" He breaks through his upstairs closet, looks through and says, "Oh my God, it's another apartment!" He put another bathroom up there with a tub with mirrored walls that didn't get foggy. Very special. ♪ It was a real, east village happening place. Girls coming in, girls coming out. A lot-- lot of young girls. God knows where they all are now. It was open to everybody. His home was like a-- kind of a cultural center in New York for me. I could easily adapt, coming from Africa, coming to Pablo's house. The spirit was the same. Giving, loving, caring. Probably was like Paris in the '20s. As near as I could figure. But I think he had a barber chair or something that had hydraulic lifts on it or something that just sent you way up higher, and higher, and higher that you would imagine that a normal barber chair would go. The legend, the reality of Pablo Ferro. Who knows. Good champagne, good grass. He always had the refrigerator was stocked with great stuff. Dom Pérignon. He always had Dom Pérignon. He lived well, man. He ate well. I just used to love to go there. It was my favorite place to be. ♪ There might be some stuff in those drawers that I might want. So just tell me now what you want in these guys that aren't-- What are the first things you want? What should go in there? Yeah, I just wanted the labels. Books for the living room. Well, life can get tough. Yes, there are-- years can go by without a gig. He certainly hasn't had a big in vogue season. "Oh, you gotta see Pablo Ferro's work." I don't know how many people are saying that today. You better be careful with this award. It comes apart very easy. But there's a body of work that would stun a lot of people in this town who meet him and don't know it. This is Pablo Ferro losing his home. This is a garage. Yeah, well, I just moved here two months ago. And then we're trying to fix the garage into a living studio. This is Pablo Ferro moving into his son's garage. This is great. I'm very happy here. I feel more comfortable. The other place was big and all that stuff. Just didn't feel right. Pablo makes, anywhere he lives, he makes it his own. He did make the best of it. It was good for him to be near family. Hey, Grandpa. Allen! What's up, grandpa? How you doin'? You've been doing a lot of credits on the computer, Grandpa. Mhm. You've been controlling it with relative ease. They were a cohesive family unit, and he was brought into that. So, it was nice. And he made the best of living in such a small space. ♪ Next time I worked with Hal, we had a big hit. Both of us. He was editing, and I was hired to do the multiples. It was not business as usual. That's what "The Thomas Crown Affair" signifies. It was something bold and different, and it's part of what made that film so chic, so stylish, so arresting. By juxtaposing these images simultaneously, we all were thinking, "Wow, how cool, how brilliantly fashioned." What we in the audience saw was this whole new cinematic frontier that had suddenly been opened up. It was just a caper movie. Steve McQueen was masterminding the thing, and they didn't know him. So, it was kinda the perfect set up. By putting multiple screens on the same screen where you were watching five to six films at the same time. And it wasn't confusing. Pablo just went crazy. ♪ I made mattes. Male and female mattes. And after you're shooting you put in the back, and then you put your picture behind it, and then you adjust the picture to fit into that mold hole. I've talkin' through. You shoot one panel, and then you run back, and then you shoot the next panel. Then you go, reverse the film again, and the third panel. In one scene I had about 66 panels. Now if the guy would have one mistake, he has to do it all over again. ♪ They looked at it, they go, "Wow, Pablo, it looks terrific, but can you make it longer?" The imitators, they tried to capitalize on the excitement of switching because everybody wanted to see more of it. It was considered that this is something that's now gonna be in most films. It's certainly something that the hippest films wanna have in it. Of course it got copied, overused. These things happen. Everything gets trendy, and then, you know, beaten to death. But he was the one who first did it, and he was the one who did it best. You know people had never seen stuff like that before. Because then it was I became a hero. Everybody loved me.
