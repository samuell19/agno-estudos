(wax dripping) (intense dramatic music) (stamp thudding) (dramatic horn music) (soft tribal music) (explosion booming) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) - [Narrator] Many moons ago, isolated in the remote mountains of Central America, a small village named Mangaño once thrived. A primitive tribe of people, they lived in harmony with nature for many generations, but now a time of reckoning was upon the all. Working in the simple mud and grass hut of his father and his grandfather before him, using the skills that were passed down through blood, the village piñata maker, Hunumah, began the most important creation in the history of his village. (soft tribal music) For a mysterious drought had claimed the once fertile land, and the scorching sun was becoming relentless. Using the precious few droplets of water to shape the clay, his creation began to take form. As food was becoming scarce, the families prayed that the evil would be driven out and famine would not consume the land. The long, hot days melted into cold, dark nights, and the nights blurred into day as Hanumah combined elements of human and animal form. (soft tribal music) An unknown petulance began to spread through the tribe, and the shaman, the village holy man named Antoop, pleaded with the angry spirits to release their deadly grip on his people. (Antoop speaking in foreign language) Their time was running out, but the ancient craft could not be rushed, as the mystical design of the piñatas had to be precise. But the vengeful wrath of the spirits continued, and the once-thriving valley was now being consumed by misery and despair. (villagers wailing) Surrounded by the cries of suffering, Hanumah sculpted one hand with the power of the bear. (shaman chanting) The laid pieces were joined, and Hanumah prepared the piñatas for firing. (pig screeching) Sacrificing a wild pig, the shaman carefully removed the freshly harvested heart. The heart would be the central force inside the piñata. It would draw the evil through the clay. From the tribe's holiest shrine, Antoop removed one of the sacred stones and focused its spiritual energy. For once inside the head of the piñata, the stone's power would activate the sorcery to seal away the evil forever. (dramatic tribal music) The time had come to make the pilgrimage to the sacred site, and Antoop led his people on the difficult many day journey. Hanumah added the final symbolic markings to the piñatas. The ceremony was now ready to begin. (intense dramatic music) At the sacred river, Antoop inhaled from the pipe of his forefathers, linking him with the spiritual world. He summoned the forces of nature and cried out to the gods. (Antoop yelling in foreign language) (intense dramatic music) One by one he called his people forward. The shaman believed the curse was a punishment from the angry spirits for the sins in the villager's hearts, the dark side that is a part of us all, and he began the ritual to cleanse their soul. (demons screeching) (dramatic tribal music) Touching the good fortune piñata, the villagers would complete the circle of energy. (dramatic tribal music) The transfer was now final, and the evil force was trapped inside the clay cavity of the piñata. Silent prayers were uttered as Antoop carefully set the grotesque piñata afloat. The steady current of the holy river would carry away the evil. (intense dramatic music) (clay shattering) The ceremony continued with the cracking of the good fortune piñata. (children whooping) As the sin-filled piñata floated away, the forces of nature continued to build. (thunder clapping) (lightning zapping) (explosion booming) Antoop's task was now complete with the final bolt of energy. As long as the piñata lay undisturbed, the evil would remain locked inside by the magically-charged clay. But should the sinful force be awakened, an unholy terror would be unleashed upon mankind, a terror with a craving for the eternal power of innocent souls, bringing death and destruction to all in its path.

You're kidding me? - Oh, girl, what did you expect? - The girls at the house said that there were full camping facilities with showers and toi- (group mocking) - Yo, go back to model town, girl. - Bite me! - Uh-uh-uh-uh, there will be no sexual activity on this island unless I am directly involved.

I don't understand. - Just take it easy. - You'd understand, you know, if he fell out of a tree or, or hit his head on a rock, you know? Shit happens. But. Okay, yes, we were drinking. And yes, we were smoking. But I know what I saw, and as crazy as it sounds, it happened. And, um. I should've just left the damn thing in the mud. We have to get off this island. (dirt and rocks clattering) - Oh, yeah. Who's the man, baby? (laughing) One, two. Three, four. Five, six. (shovel thudding) (dramatic tribal music) Woo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah! (demon roaring) All right!

(demon roaring) (Larry screaming) - Do you believe her or do you think this is some sort of practical joke? I mean, what do you think she saw? - I don't know. - Do you think he's dead? - Why would she lie? And if he isn't, where is he? Something happened out there. The question is what. (engine starting) - Well, what Maureen didn't see was me slapping him in the face after he kissed me. I mean, I didn't know he was gonna do that, believe me. I have no interest in that guy whatsoever. Besides, he's an arrogant asshole and I haven't seen him since. What? You don't believe me now? - No, just hurry up and concentrate. You're gettin' really heavy. - Oh, so now I'm fat? - No. Just get 'em all down so you can get your ass down. - Well, you can believe what you want.

In my side duffel is my starter's pistol. Fire off a shot for the others and start packing your gear. - Here. In case we need to coordinate. - Are we leaving? - Maybe. - If y'all pass any of the others on the way back, let 'em know what's going on. - Lisa's already there. She's pretty upset about Bob. Be careful. - [Monica] Bob! - [Paul] Bob, where are you? Bob! - Bob? (tense suspenseful music) Bob! - Bob! (engines rumbling) Bob! - [Monica] Bob! - [Both] Bob! - Bob?

You guys should've just left everything. How can this happen? I know what I saw. - [Bob] It's just a piñata. It's just a piñata. It's just a piñata. (soft solemn music) - Thanks. - Look, I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions about- - You know what? It's okay. I probably would've reacted the same way if the situation were reversed. - I miss you, T. - Yeah, me too. (soft solemn music) (tense suspenseful music) - Kyle, it's Paul. Are you there?

Okay, get down to the boats right away. - [Kyle] What is it? - Bob's dead. We just found him strung up in a tree, ripped in half. - What? - [Paul] His head was bashed in like a fresh pumpkin. Kyle? Kyle, are you there? - Yeah. - Grab whatever you can and get down to the boats. We'll try to find the others and direct them to the beach. As soon as you've got a full boat, take off back to camp. The rest of us will take the second boat. Be careful. Someone or something's out there and it's majorly fucked up. (engines starting) (intense dramatic music) - [Paul] Jake! - [Monica] Jake! - What happened out there? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. - [Paul] Julie! - [Monica] Julie! Connie!

We're lost. - No, we're not lost, we're not lost. Look, we're just, uh, we're taking the scenic route. - Everything is scenic out here, Doug. - I know, I know. But listen, I promise you. We're gonna get back and we're gonna win this. A little extra walk is not gonna kill ya. (waves lapping) - Shit. - Oh my god. (dramatic mysterious music) (engines rumbling) - [Paul] Doug?

Try to think. - It happened so fast. I don't know. But I saw its eyes, and they were fiery red and glowing and- - Why are we still talking about this? I mean, you guys don't actually believe there's a killer piñata out there, do you? - I don't know what I think. There's this old Mexican folklore I studied about that fits what Lisa's description is. It tells a story of Magaño, a small, remote village in Central America. - That had a killer piñata? - The village was prosperous until suddenly famine and disease consumed it. The shaman figured it was the sins of the people that brought on this curse. So he decided to perform a ceremony to rid the land of the evilness in their hearts. He created two symbolic piñatas. One to represent good fortune, and the other to be used as a receptacle for the transgressions of the entire village. He symbolically transferred the sins onto the piñata and cast it off by setting it out to sea. Now, according to the folklore, prosperity soon returned and the piñata was never seen again. - So you think that's what's out there? - I saw prints near the wreckage of the boats that was made by a creature with hoofed feet. Now the legend says that this piñata had two hoofed feet, and the actual heart of a pig. It's upper body is very human-like with fire-red eyes and horns on its head. - Like the devil. - Okay, is there any proof of this ever happening? - No. - Well then how do we know? - Look, just because they haven't found any proof doesn't mean it never really ever happened. - Well, usually they have something to support it if it's true. - No, they're finding things in the Middle East everyday that supports stories in the Old Testament. Now does that mean the Red Sea was ever really parted? Maybe the evidence didn't survive time, or perhaps it's still waiting to be found. - But a piñata coming alive and killing people? I mean, that's a bit out there, don't you think? - Did the legend say anything about it coming to life? - Not that I recall. - Then how do you explain that? - We were hitting it with a stone, trying to break it open to see what was inside. And when we finally cracked it, we heard a sound like, like we were letting out the pain and suffering of an entire village. I had no idea how to describe it until you just put it into words. We thought it was because we were high, but that is exactly what it sounded like. - Have you ever heard of an animal with only two hoofed feet? (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (bird cawing) (Lisa gasping) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (Lisa gasping) (metal clanging) - [Tina] What was that? - Who's there? - [Tina] Oh my god, I'm gonna die. Oh my god, I'm gonna die. - [Kyle] Shh, shh. (intense dramatic music) (Doug and Carmen screaming) (Lisa screaming) - What the hell are you doing? - What's wrong? We're just having a little fun. - It's not funny. - Obviously you guys don't know what's been going on? - Ooo, what's been going on? - Hey, where's everyone else? (intense dramatic music) (insects chirping) (water rippling) (birds chirping) - All right, we've given them a couple hours. It's light and there's no response from the walkie talkie. Let's get goin'. Everyone stay close together. - Why don't we try and swim back to campus? - What? - Swim. Why don't we swim? - It's 15 miles, Lisa. - Yeah, so. Marathons are 26. - I'm not that good of a swimmer. - The ocean's different. We'd never make it. - A boat would see us? - Maybe. - And what about sharks? - Fine. Fine, then why don't we just stay right here. - You know what? There's six of our friends out there that may need our help. - We'd do the same for you. - It's not that I don't want to help them, okay? It's just that what are we gonna do? We're gonna get ourselves killed. What is that gonna do? If we stay here, we could write emergency messages, put 'em in bottles- - Lisa. - No, wait. And then one of us could go down and throw them in the water and then maybe someone will find them. - It could take decades for someone to get that bottle. - Okay, fine. Then let's stay here and wait 'til someone back at school realizes that something's wrong and sends another boat. - Maybe she's right. Look, they'll probably send another boat tomorrow or the day after, for sure, right? - Yeah, and how do we even know they're still alive? - How do we know they're not? - Well, hey, I mean, we made it back. - Yeah, so did we. - If it were me out there, I would want us to be smart and stay in an open area like this. Not out there where it has the advantage. - She has a point. Look, nothing happened to us last night, guys. - You know what? I'm out. I'm going to help my friends. - Hang on. It's stupid for us to split up. It's a good way to find yourself wakin' up dead. - I agree with that. - Look, either we all stay or we all go. We might die either way. We don't know it's safer to stay here. Me personally? My vote is to try to help our friends rather than hide and hope someone comes to rescue us. Brothers and sisters, right? (upbeat dramatic music) (tense suspenseful music) (demon roaring) - [Lisa] Jake! Jake! You good? Kyle! (demon growling) (feet stomping) (soft suspenseful music) (Kyle sniffing) - [Doug] Ugh! - What is that smell? (leaves rustling) (tense suspenseful music) (intense dramatic music) (flies buzzing) - Uh! - Oh, shit. (coughing) - Oh, poor thing. - This was not done for food. - No. - Need anymore proof? We should go back. - We made a decision. Let's keep movin'. (flies buzzing) - [Carmen] Hey, you guys, hold on a second. Doug's got something- - Hold it. Girl, I'm okay. Just go ahead in. - No, we'll wait. - Kyle, it's okay, man. I just got this rock in my shoe. It's driving me crazy. I'll catch up. - Hey, easy on the water. - Kyle, I'm serious, man. Go ahead. - All right, let's go. (demon roaring) (soft suspenseful music) (demon roaring) - Fuck. This rock. (tense suspenseful music) (demon roaring) (bird cawing) (tense suspenseful music) (demon roaring) (tense suspenseful music) - This is stupid. We should all stick together. - [Carmen] Yeah. (rising suspenseful music) (demon roaring) - Paul? - Monica? - [Doug] Jake? - [Tina] Monica? - [Doug] Jake? Come on, man. - Monica? Monica? Julie! Monica? (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (tense suspenseful music) Doug? Doug! Quit joking around. This is not funny! Doug? This isn't funny! - Carmen! Carmen! Where'd you say he was? - He was right behind me, you guys. I swear to god, he was right there! - Doug! - Oh my god, he's dead. - Stop it, stop it. - I wanna go back. Can we go back? Can we all go back? - [Carmen] Doug? - It's safer there. I wanna go back. I'm going back. - No, no, no. Listen, we have to stay together. Doug! - No, no, no! You don't understand! You're not listening to me! I wanna go back. (Doug grunting) - She's right. Nothing happened to us there last night. We should go back! - Carmen. - No! He talked us into coming out here, and you were wrong. - We all made the decision. - We're safer back at the camp. Doug would still be alive. Out here, it has too many- (demon roaring) (Doug grunting) I hate him. Come on, Lisa, let's go. - No, just let 'em go. Maybe they will be safer back at the camp. Let's just keep going. - God damn it. (demon roaring) (Doug grunting) - How much further? - Well, we've still got a ways. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) - I really have to pee. - Can't you wait till we get back? - [Kyle] These seem pretty fresh. - [Tina] Yeah. - It looks like it's headed back towards... Oh, shit! - I can't hold it anymore. - You have to. - I've been holding it for the last hour. - All right, all right. Go over there. Just do it quickly, okay? - Okay. (intense dramatic music) - Oh. - Hurry up! (demon growling) - What was that? - What? - I don't know. I thought I heard something. - I don't see anything. (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) What? (demon roaring) (Lisa screaming) (demon roaring) (Lisa screaming) (Lisa gasping) - Which way did it go? Stay here. Don't leave. (Lisa gasping) (intense dramatic music) (Lisa gasping) - Shh. Shh. (tense suspenseful music) - Son of a bitch! (birds chirping) (tense suspenseful music) (twigs cracking) (tense suspenseful music) - Lisa, what are you doing? Come here. Lisa! Shit. (intense dramatic music) (Lisa gasping) (tense suspenseful music) (birds fluttering) (tense suspenseful music) (footstep crunching) (tense suspenseful music) (intense dramatic music) (Monica screaming) - No. (crying) (Lisa gasping) (intense dramatic music) (metal clanging) - [Lisa] Paul? Is that you? Hey! Larry? It's Lisa. Hey, who's in there? (demon roaring) (Lisa screaming) (intense dramatic music) (bone cracking) (Lisa screaming) (intense dramatic music) (bone cracking) (Lisa screaming) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (Lisa screaming) (demon roaring) - Lisa! (demon growling) Hey, you know, we really do need to stick together. Come on, Lisa. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (demon shrieking) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) - Tina! Lisa! God damn. Where the hell are they? - Are you sure this is the spot? - Yeah. Shit. Shit. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) Come on. (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) Tina! - Lisa! (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) - I'm coming! (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) - Shh, shh, shh. (dark ominous music) (demon roaring) - It's over there. It's right behind- - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Where's Lisa? (demon roaring) (soft solemn music) (demon growling) (demon roaring) Where'd you crash? (demon roaring) (rocks thudding) (demon roaring) (footsteps thudding) Go, go, go, go. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) Be careful. Hold on. Does any of this look familiar? - I don't know, um. You know, it all happened so fast. I crashed and I flipped, and then Paul. It was my fault. (crying) - Hey, hey, come on. There's nothing you could've done about that. - We, we were looking for the others in the northeast part of the woods, you know? (Monica sniffling) They should be somewhere up ahead. - Let's hope you're right. We need that gas for our plan to work. It's time for us to stop being hunted and start doing the hunting. (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) - This is it. I remember coming through here, passing under this flag. - Here, this way. (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) - There. Is that it? - Yeah. Yeah, that's it. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) So how are we gonna get the gas out? - Can we turn it over? - I'll pull the fuel line. I'll siphon the gas. (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (Kyle spitting) - Yes! - Container. (demon roaring) - Oh my god. - Shit. Come on, come on. (demon roaring) Come on, come on. - A little more. Just a little more. - He's coming. Hurry up! - Isn't that enough? - That canteen. Thank you. - [Monica] Hurry up, hurry up! (demon growling) Faster! (demon roaring) (tense suspenseful music) (ATV humming) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) - Sorry. I need a second to catch my breath. (Monica gasping) (demon roaring) It shouldn't be much further, right? - A mile, I think. - How much head start you think we got? - I don't know. - So who are we gonna use for bait? (demon roaring) - Come on, let's go. (Monica screaming) (demon roaring) (Monica crying) - Let's get goin'. Take his walkie. Come on. We're running out of time. (Monica crying) (Monica gasping) There's nothing we can do for him. We gotta get goin'. - Come on, Monica. We don't have a lot of time. (intense dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic hip hop music) (rock pounding) (ratchet clicking) (fuel splashing) (dramatic hip hop music) (intense dramatic music) (fire crackling) (match flicking) (flames whooshing) (demon roaring) - [Monica] So that's where I am. (Monica speaking indistinctly) We don't know where. Keep coming. (footsteps clomping) (intense dramatic music) (Monica speaking indistinctly) What else? I'm a sitting duck. I'm a Woodson University alumni. I work at the (indistinct). I'm, uh, single. (demon roaring) Right now. Yes, I can feel you coming closer. This better work. I hope I hear you coming. Come and get me. I'm all yours, you fucking ceramic motherfucker. I'm gonna keep talking and talking. (demon roaring) Talk more. (demon roaring) A good old standard like. (demon roaring) Maybe I should talk in Spanish since you're a piñata. Um, hola. Yo quiero Taco Bell. Shit. Come on, Kyle. Don't be late! Kyle! (demon roaring) (watermelon splatting) (rope winding) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (flames crackling) Burn, motherfucker, burn! (demon roaring) (flames crackling) - [Tina] Die, bitch! (demon roaring) (flames crackling) (demon roaring) - Shit! - Monica! (Monica screaming) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (weapon thudding) (demon roaring) (Tina screaming) (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) Shit! (intense dramatic music) (demon roaring) (Kyle grunting) - [Kyle] Use the gas. (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (Kyle grunting) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (fabric ripping) (Kyle grunting) (demon roaring) - Come on, come on. (intense dramatic music) (weapon clanging) (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) Have a shot at this, motherfucker! (demon roaring) (intense dramatic music) (explosion booming) (all grunting) (demons roaring) (Tina and Kyle grunting) (soft solemn music) (intense dramatic music) - You ever seen anything like this? - [Cop] I got this one. - You gotta tell us what happened here.
