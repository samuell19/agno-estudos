[engines roar] [soft music] Running low, Frank. Enough to make it back? Yeah, just enough. Doesn't look I'm making this thing back. There's only one more plane to make-- Yeah, Mike. I'm still up for more. Thanks for reminding me again. Hey, I'm just doing my job, man. All right. Let's head back. Roger that. [suspenseful music] Easy. Mike, there's a train down here. I'm going to take a pass. Roger that. Make it fast. I'm running low on fuel. And me. Right. That's why I said make it fast. [explosions] [wheels screech] Man, I love when those trains explode. Woo! Just in time. Roger that. [engine roars] [dramatic music] [artillery fire] Mike? Mike! No! No. [artillery fire] [tearing] Mayday, mayday. This is Little Blue, over. Mayday. Code red. [engine stops] Come on, you piece of shit. [serene music] [light, suspenseful music] [engine roars] How much further you reckon these white soldiers are? They should be just up ahead. I haven't seen a minefield all day. Well, that's the point, Salty. You're not supposed to see a mine. That's why we find them and disassemble them. The Germans bury them at night. Well, them white boys don't like that finding them at night stuff. Dammit, Salty, if the mines don't kill, us your driving will. You just let me worry about the driving. Salty, that's exactly what I'm worried about because you can't drive worth a damn. Ain't my fault these roads are hard as hell on the tranny. On the tranny. Yeah, right. Just keep it straight and true. I always do, Lieutenant. We figure this is the last minefield we're going to have to clear before we push in to Bellecour? Well, the army don't like losing tanks. Yeah. Best send in the dark-skinned brothers. They don't mind losing us. [laughs] Crackers in the back of the bus this time. Ain't no fare you want to ride. It's what we're trained to do, gentlemen. I'm just glad we're in the fight. Hell yeah? Hell yeah. And Lord, bless this Jeep and get us safely through this minefield. Help us strike down our enemy who strives to vanquish our divine mission to restore peace and prosperity in your mighty Kingdom. Amen. [car bumps] And Lord, please provide a safe passage and salvation from Salty's driving, amen. Amen. I don't think that's how the Lord works. Well, he's supposed to work in mysterious ways. Yeah. [laughs] Funny. You guys wait here. Hey, sir, can I help you? Yes, Lieutenant. You're late. Sorry, sir. This mine needs to be disposed. Yes, sir. That's my job. Oh, I know it is. Do you think I know it? Yes, sir. We'll take care of it. Have you swept and cleared this area for any enemy? Of course we have, yup. Don't you think we'd be here if it wasn't clear? I would hope so. Just get this cleared, Lieutenant, and then we can get moving. You're holding us up. Are we clear? Crystal, sir. [sighs] Help. [dramatic music] Faster. We'll blitz them now. You understand? It's the only thing we have. Go. [troops speaking german] Yo, them white boys don't be looking too happy. When we around, white folks ain't ever happy. That's true. That's true. Found it. It's a teller mine. Mark it and blow. Oh, we're going to blow it. Salty. Sir? One pound of HG. SALTY: Sir. Fire! [artillery fire] If they hit those mines, then he's gone. They hit that mine, we all gone. [gunshots] SOLDIER: Hey, get him. Don't be stupid. SOLDIER: [exclamation] And fire! We've got to help him. We're going to attack. We're going to attack? Thank god he knows what he's doing. Go, go. [suspenseful music] [gunshots] [high-pitched sound] [somber music] We've got to help him. [gunshots] Cover me. Got it. On me. Yeah. [shouting] We will deploy. You will cover us on the spot. Sir. There will be no surrender. You understand? [exclamation] [somber music] [dramatic music] Everything OK, sir? Yeah. Hell yeah? Hell yeah. [artillery fire] [gunshots] What's that round? Bazooka. Ellison. Army men. We're going to clear down the trench in the firing line. Understood? Yes, sir. Ready? On my mark. Hey, Ellie? Don't miss. 3, 2, now. Over the top. [soldiers speaking german] Dozer, I want you to keep firing and don't let up. Yes, sir. This is your signal. [explosion] [gunshots] Fire! [explosion] Hands up! I said, hands up! Get up on them. Both hands. Let me see them, right now. [swing music] [scoffs] What is this? This look like goose shit. I can't eat this. You don't even want this. I ain't seen you eat all day. You ain't nothing else? You got something else. That's even worse. Stop it. Stop. [soldiers clamor] Y'all shut up. Y'all shut up. You got to eat. Nasty anyway. No worse than your mama makes. [somber music] Did what I could, found some real eggs. You did right. But sometimes when you're right, you're wrong. And when they're wrong, they're right. We've got no control over it. I figure the best we could do is not fear it, keep moving forward. The rest of the cards, they have to fall where they fall. [chuckles] You have a way to fight a war. Hell of a way. Real eggs, huh? Stole them myself. These are real eggs, all right. Hell yeah. [both chuckle] I put your name forward for your battlefield commission. Why is that? Because the army needs good Black officers. But me? That's right, Red. Does that mean I'd have to leave the-- leave the men? There is a probability. Thank you. Look, you don't have to accept it, but you do deserve it. Think about it. [spits] In the army, we salute officers. I don't believe you heard the Lieutenant. We don't salute Negroes. We don't salute the color of a man's skin. You'll either salute the Lieutenant or pick your teeth up off the ground. Now, was that so hard? What are you all looking at? Get back to work! [clicks teeth] Lieutenant. Sergeant. Sir. Well, I'm up to my elbows in logistics for a push into Metz, and all the division seems to care about is putting together a damn search party for some crashed fighter pilot. Can you believe that? No, sir. So I'm hoping you have the scouting report on the blue sector. Yes, sir. Zone blue is clear. We double our push from green into blue, we can clear those mines without any issue, sir. [clears throat] Protect Metz from the northeast? It's the best route, sir. It's all here. You're one of my best, Lieutenant. Thank you, sir. MAJOR ANDERSON: So I heard you had trouble up there. The Germans sprung an ambush on us. Thick? Tanks, AT guns, machine guns, and mortars, 50 to 60 men. We cleared the sector. Good. Well, I meant to address both of you up front about a few things. Well, I received the paperwork for your battlefield commission. Congratulations, Sergeant. Thank you, sir. Well, I don't know what the army's going to say. It's not very common for them to approve a commission like that. I understand, sir. But I forwarded the paperwork up to division with my recommendation. You certainly deserve it. Thank you, sir. Now, I'm going to have to be straight with you, Lieutenant. Division has reassigned you pending an investigation into your conduct during yesterday's mission. Investigation? Well, someone's trying to pin the blame for that German ambush on you. But, sir, that ain't at all. It was them crack-- it was them white soldiers that didn't do their job. They didn't clear the sector. Major Anderson, with all due respect, sir, I did my job. Sir, this just ain't right. Look. I know we're snowed. You give me three or four days, I'll have these charges dismissed. What about my men, sir? Well, Red here will have a chance to show an officer he can be. But-- I don't like it either, but it's the best I can do. Where do I report, sir? Report to command post eight on the other side of camp. They'll take you back to division for reassignment. Look, we'll fight this, and we'll win. Keep your head up, Lieutenant. Yes, sir. I'm sorry about that, sir. Hey, don't even worry about it. I need you to take care of the men. They're just as much yours as they are mine. [sighs] I'll fill you in when I get back. All right? All right. HAYES: All right. Good luck. HAYES: Take care. Thanks. [sighs] Nice to see you again, Lieutenant. [spits] You just don't learn, do you? What they hell do think you're doing, Lieutenant. Sir, it's not what it looks like. Do you understand English, Lieutenant? Yes, I do, sir. That's better. That's the one, Captain. This is the one that's been giving you boys all this trouble? Sir, it is not-- Did I ask you, Lieutenant? Now, the army may have given you that rank, but that don't mean shit to me or my boys. So that's your place, in the back. Enjoy it. Yes, sir. Mount up! [engines start] [pensive music] Red, I've seen that face before. Where the army got us going next? Everybody, listen up. Listen up. There's no right way to say this, so I'm just going to say it. Lieutenant Hayes has been temporarily reassigned to division. What? What? I said temporarily. For what? Pending an investigation. Now, look. Now, Hayes can handle himself. Before long, he'll-- he'll be back. Until then, we're not going to disappoint him when he returns, are we? ALL: No, Sergeant. All right. Now, I want those field radios cleaned and working by the end of the day. Understand? ALL: Yes, Sergeant. RED: Make a hole. You boys heard the sergeant. Let's get back to work. Sit down. No, I'm serious. [birds chirp] Damn it. How's it going? Something's not right. We should have hit division a long time ago. [sighs] Hey, gents. Son of a bitch. I'm familiar with the area. If you want, I can help. And get us all killed like those other soldiers you tried to help? Not on my watch. Get on the radio. Find out where the hell we are. MAN (OVER RADIO): This is Mike Devine from UN. Here. MAN (OVER RADIO): We believe we are at sector 17B, pushing our way to division. Our current location we believe to be 52 degrees north latitude, 19 degrees east longitude. Americans. MAN (OVER RADIO): I repeat, 52 north, 19 east. Americans, no-- the half tracks. [command] [men shout] [radio crackles] What's going on? Shut up! We're working. What? I said, shut up-- sorry, Sarge. I ain't know it was you. Look, I can't find a frequency if you all keep flapping your lips. What the hell is going on? Well, you said that Hayes is being reassigned, right? Yeah. Well, Salty got his hands on some radio frequency codes. It sounds like your boy is in some sort of trouble. They got lost behind the lines. Give me that. [engine rumbles] God damn it. Get back to your vehicle. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't hear that? [artillery fire] [dramatic music] [explosion] Red one, red one. This is Charlie 49er. I repeat, this is Charlie 49er. We're under attack. We're going back into the woods. I repeat, we are going back into the woods. Stop. Stop. You'll reveal the location. [artillery fire] Get him back, Salty. [gunshots] [gunshots] [speaking german] Fire! [artillery fire] Major. Sergeant. Sir. You heard about the ambush. Sir, we got to go rescue them. We can't be sure anyone made it out of that. But sir, if there's a possibility he might be alive, we-- we got to go get him. I don't have the authority to send out a rescue party at this time. But sir, it would just take-- just-- We cannot go charging off on some rescue operation. We've got a city to take and a war to win. But, sir-- There's nothing I can do. Hayes is a smart man. If he's still alive, he'll find a way to make it back. But we have no way of-- sir. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Lieutenant. Think about it. Get over here. Come on. [gunshot] [grunts] [gunshots] [suspenseful music] Get down! Shh. Follow me. I don't see any more Germans. Good. You're lucky I was around. I was doing just fine. You a pilot? Yeah. Well, I was until I was shot down. Maybe I'm the one that's rescuing you. Hey, I was doing just fine until you brought the whole damn German army right on top of me. Welcome to the war. Will you just get on your radio and call in reinforcements? Are all you pilots this dumb? This is a ham radio. We don't have near enough range to make contact. And even if we did, we have half the German army between us, remember? What are you doing? Hey. Stay down. Ooh. Where are you going? There still are Germans out there. Hey. Listen up, listen up. Now, the major told me there's nothing we can do for Hayes. [soldiers protest] Come on, man. Hell no. Listen. Hold on. Hold on. We can't leave him out there, Sarge. Right. Hayes is alive. That's right. We just don't have the orders, they say. [soldiers scoff] We've got to go. We can't leave him stranded like that. But you know what I say? I say, to hell with orders. SOLDIERS: Yeah. We're going to find Hayes and bring him back. [soldiers cheer] Shh, shh. Now, does anybody have any ideas for a plan? Anybody else? Salty, why are we at the PX? Trust me. Old Thomas will help us. You mean the mail sergeant? Come on, man. Let's go. Thomas. You got my money? Me? I owe you money? Man, give me my money. You be your own people, your own people. Don't stop. That was it. Interest. You take your little $7, then you stupid-- All of it. You ain't gonna leave me no money. You're lucky it's not more. You-- you're just going to count it in my face? So let me just get a dollar back. Pleasure doing business. Salty, not him. Let's go. We'll find another way. I heard about Hayes. What a loss. He was a damn good man. What do you know about Hayes? Look around you, son. I own the news around here. Well look, Thomas, look, that's why we're here. We think Hayes is alive. We want to go out and find him and bring him back. Now, can you help us out? Depends. What constitutes help? We need fuel, gear, and ammo, enough for two or three days. [chuckles] Gear and ammo for two or three days? That's-- that's a lot of supplies on short notice, gentlemen, with no acquisition orders? Salty, let's go. Not this guy. Let's go. Sounds like you boys can use some tank support. Who is this? Sergeant Warren Creasy, first squad. Yeah, I let him sleep off his hangovers up there sometimes. [scoffs] Pays me good. Now, why would you help us? You're trying to kill crouch, right? But we don't exactly have orders for such a mission. I've never been too fond of taking orders. Clearly. Hey, hey. I know what it looks like, man, but-- and we need that. We do. Suppose you show us these tanks. Light tanks? I don't like the size of them for you. Girls can go pound for pound, take out any front line in a firefight. This is California Love, Blood and Guts. That's my baby right there, Alamo. Oh, I like her. These are real men out here, real men that have put it all on the line, real killers. They look pretty green to me. Two years in the Georgia swamps, six months in the blistering hot sun of Texas, training for war. Almost nine months training for Germans. Looks are deceiving. OK. Follow me. 500 gallons of gasoline? Who made that order? Yes, who? Well, you hold on to that order till I find out what the hell is going on. Right. Yeah, we heard about Lieutenant Hayes. Shame. I saw Red. He wasn't too happy about it either. None of us are. Anything else? Sir, you know about that missing pilot that division's been asking about? Well, they say he shot down a German jet plane, one of Germany's new weapons. They say that pilot landed in the same sector that Lieutenant Hayes went missing in. Division would like this pilot found. Put together a search party, Hayes could be found. Well, division would be pleased, sir. But there's no way division is going to improve redirecting our field artillery when our-- our push is 36 hours away. Oh, sir, I forgot to tell you that um-- well, General Patton just confirmed his arrival for troop review before pushing to Metz. Didn't you serve with him in Africa? I did. Huh. Yeah, that's what I thought. A damn fine man. Well, thank you, Sergeant. You've been very helpful. Sir, keep the pen. [sighs] Smith? Give me a line to the third army. SMITH: I'm on it, sir. Someone get my Jeep. [mosquitoes buzz] HAYES: You're making noise. FRANK: I'm not trying to. HAYES: Just avoid the thick stuff. You've never been in the woods before? Sure. Central Park. Central Park? In New York? FRANK: Yeah. It's not the same thing, city boy. FRANK: Where are we even going? HAYES: Random mill, up the road. Well, are we close yet? No, we're not close. We're a long way from the line, and we're a long way from New York. Are all you like that? Who? Blacks? No. I meant ground pounders, leg boys like yourself. Goodbye, city boy, and good luck. I'm leaving your dumb ass before you get me killed. Hey, get back here. That's an order. An order? I follow orders to ensure mission success. Hell, I'll follow orders to save a life. But what I won't do is follow orders that will willfully getting me killed. I'm not trying to get you killed. Goodbye, Lieutenant. And don't follow me. [sighs, spits] SOLDIER: All right. Giddy up, god damn it. Major Anderson, the 761st battalion. I need to speak to the general. GENERAL PATTON: Come on, men. Hitler's waiting for us. We've got all day. I'm going to need you to stop right there, sir. GENERAL PATTON: I've seen old whores move faster than that. General, sir. You lost, son? Major Anderson, sir, 761st battalion. Ah, I expect a lot from those Black tankers, Major. I served under you, sir, Gershwin Pass, command B, first armored. My boys took on a minefields, 15th Panzer, sir. Licked them good. Anderson. Yeah. Hell of a fine job you did with those boys in Athens. Damn good job. Fine work, fine work. Those Black tankers are damn proud to have you. Thank you, sir. I have a request, sir. I'd like to redirect the division of artillery this evening, grid section 843. Sure, sure. Anything for a regular Stonewall Jackson. I am counting on you and your boys to get us into Metz. Don't let me down. No, sir. Thank you, sir. All right. Giddy up, god damn it. Let's go. [engines start] Load them up, boys. Let's move them out. Here we go. Hayes' last known position. Now, I suggest we take Fagan Roadway, send your tanks down this rail line here, convene at this juncture. That rail line should be just fine. What about the Germans? We leave at night. Artillery might help confuse them. Those snatch-and-grab stewards provide service to protect us from the Krauts. Tonight, zero 100 departure. Don't be late. Mail's always on time, son. So how much is this favor going to cost us? [chuckles] I'll decide that if you all make it back. Make sure you're there. You can count on it. Gentlemen, don't fuck this up. Come on. Stupid flies. HAYES: Stop! Don't move. You're in a minefield. Shit. What do I do? Put your foot back into your last step. Breathe. Stay calm. OK. What are you doing? I'm going to come out and get you, clear a path, and bring you back to safety. But I can see them. Oh, that ain't all of them. I don't want to see anyone here slacking. Come on. Move, gentlemen. Sergeant. Major. Mail drop off, sir? It's a little late, but I hope it can still find its way out. Make sure that's delivered on time and on target. Yes, sir. Let's go, let's go, let's go. How's it coming? Looks like old Thomas made good on his promise. Oh, shit. This don't look good. This mission is unauthorized. I can't let you leave. I'm ordering you all to stand down. I'm afraid we can't do that, sir. Listen, Red, if you do this, there's no way in hell divisions can improve your battlefield commission. If that's what it takes, sir. Don't you want to be an officer? Sir, I'll trade all the commendations in this army for Lieutenant Hayes. That's what I thought. You got 24 hours, courtesy of General George Patton. I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand. Find Hayes and bring him back. If you find an American pilot out there, bring him back as well. Don't let me down, Sergeant. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Well, I'll be damned. Line up. [dramatic music] It's best to keep your mind from thinking about it. OK. OK. We've got one more thing there to my case. My wingman, I got him killed. I tried to take on this new type of German plane. It was foolish, really. Mike, I should have listened to you. Should have headed back to police. He intercepted that German plane, and he got shot and died. [somber music] A friend of mine once told me the best thing you can do in a war is to not fear. You just got to let the cards fall where they fall. What happened to Mike, it wasn't your fault. Now, just make sure to stay on the path that I just made. It's this way, watch out. Next mile and a half, we'll find the man, whatever it takes to stop. Hold it. Listen up. On my command, we're going to make a 90-degree turn in the next few miles. On my command, copy? Let's go. [jazzy music] [chuckles] Thomas. Hi. I said I would have the money. I'm going to have the money. You just have to realize-- Just-- just shut up, OK? I need an artillery barrage on grid section 473. Sure, no problem. Do you have a-- Authorization. This is-- this is not from division. General Patton. You want to call the general yourself? Everything seems to be in order. Yeah, I know. Everything is in order. Oh, and one last thing. I wonder how that got in there. Yeah, I wonder too. Well, it's-- it's my money. Beautiful, beautiful. Ah, ah. You know what? Interest. Your lady? Yeah. Get to this war and come back to me, was the last thing she said to me. She's beautiful. Thanks, man. Lisa. She wanted to get married before I shipped out. I wasn't sure if I'd make it back home. You love her? Yeah, I do. I um should've never left you back there. I'm sorry. What made you come back for me? I guess I was following orders. [both chuckle] The name is Hayes, Robert Hayes. Frank Ross. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming back. [engine roars] Looks like some sort of repair station set up in the town below. They should be sitting ducks. We'll go in our triangle formation, R, take Blood and go down to the right. Yucky, you move Alamo down to the left. California Love will center. Looking good, boys. Keep your eyes wide open. Any fucking second, those Krauts could hit us. [soldiers chat] [dramatic music] MAN (OVER RADIO): Direct orders from General Patton. The artillery attack at Fort at 1900. Yes sir, yes, sir. Fire mission, November, golf, 18, 18, fire for a fact. Hard left. [soldiers shout] Fire. [explosion] Now! [gunshots] Hard right now. Fire! [explosion] Fire. Row, aim deeper. [gunshots] Hard right now. Fire! [explosion] Fire. That one was shot cold. Call up the shots. [soldiers clamor] Hayes, we've got company. HAYES: When did they get here? Just now. I don't think they know we're in here, though. Time to go. [distant explosions] Over here. Hey. Wait here. Sarge, the road's about 15 yards beyond that berg. I don't see it on the map. It's there. Trust me. You better be right. Hey. [engine roars] All commanders, spread out. Locate and destroy the enemy tanks. [speaking german] [suspenseful music] [german over radio] Major Baker, can you hear me? Over. Creasy, can you hear me? Over. Any luck? Baker, Baker. No dice, Sarge. No sign of Creasy? Not yet. Hayes check in? No. You let me know the second you hear anything. Right away, Sergeant. SALTY: Baker, baker, can you hear me? Over. Hayes, you out there? Over. Hey, hey. Traffic on 473. Hayes, are you out there? Red one, red one, come in. Over. Red one, red one. Anyone out there? Over. SALTY (OVER RADIO): Lieutenant Hayes, is that you? Salty? SALTY (OVER RADIO): It's good to hear your voice, sir, and know you're still alive. Salty, we're at the old mill in grid section 4731. I got one friend with me. Do you copy? I repeat. We're located at the old mill in gird section 4731. Grid 473, now. [soldiers clamor] We've got to go. [distant artillery] Here and here. We work our way down this line, we should locate them. Well, what about Creasy? I want you to fortify our position here and wait for him. Be ready for anything. You got it. Let's move. You heard him. Let's hold here, boys. Keep your eyes out. Comb the surface. [engine roars] Shit, shit! Reverse, reverse! [artillery fire] I'm on the 50. Cover me. [suspenseful music] [gunshots] Son of a bitch. That doesn't sound good. No, it don't. You got the bazooka? Made sure Ali grabbed it. Let's get it ready. We're going to have some company. Hey. Make sure you're going to grab the bazooka, OK? Yeah, OK. [distant explosions] Shit. [gunshots] Come on. [commands] What do you? We can't stay here. I'll cover you. Go! [gunshots] You hear that? Double time. Double time, boys. I'll distract them long enough for you to get away. No way. We're in this together. Right. Here they come. Let's do this. [grunts] [gunshots] I'm out. HAYES: Me too. Here you go. Shit! [distant gunshots] You see anything? The Germans are coming down the road. All right. Let's get ready. Let's get ready, guys. Wait till they pass. Got it. Now. HAYES: [yells] SOLDIER: [speaking german] [suspenseful music] All right. Wait for my signal. What do you think they're going to do with us? I don't know. [soldier yells] I said, get. Hey! [speaking german] Wait for it. Come on. Come on. [speaking german] the fuck off of me. Hey! Hey! Please don't do this. Don't do this, please. Get off of him. Hey. Get the fuck off of me. Hey, you piece of shit. [grunts] That's the best you got? No, no, no, no, no. Get the fuck off me. No! You can't do that to him. No! Hands up. Do it now. [gasps] Now! Now! [gunshots] Now. [artillery fire] Hands up. I said, hands up. [grunting] Tie them up. HAYES: Thank you, brother. Thank you. [gunshots] [suspenseful music] How are we doing? It honestly sounds like we're winning, sir. All right. Lieutenant, get me some coffee. This could take all day. I'm on it, sir. MAN (OVER RADIO): We're holding back a German assault. I repeat, we're at-- field and are holding back a German assault. Who's this? Lieutenant Frank Ross. You must be that pilot everybody's been looking for. I guess so. Here you go. Thanks. Let's go. All right, guys. Listen up. We're going to take their weapons and leave them. MAN (OVER RADIO): And are holding back a Germany assault. Set up the mortars. Hit them with artillery. MAN (OVER RADIO): Holding back a German assault. Sends third platoon into [non-english] Go! MAN (OVER RADIO): We're in-- field and are holding back a German assault. [gunshots] Salty, we're running out of ammo, and we don't have no rockets. [gunshots] Sons of bitches. Creasy, smoke them! Fire! [explosion] On my count. 3, 2, 1. [explosion] [gunshots] Is that a fucking tank? Fire. [explosion] Fire! [artillery fire] [suspenseful music] Fire. Go. Fire! Get out. I will finish them myself. Hell yeah. Private, look. Lieutenant, can't keep this up. Right. That's our ride. [gunshots] It's Hayes! Hell yeah! [cheering] I'll be damned. Hold your fire. Guys, over here. [explosion] Let's go, let's go, let's go. Where the hell are they? [dramatic music] Get ready on three. Shit. We'll draw them out. Fire! [explosion] Where is that coming from? That was an 88. It's hiding in those trees. [explosion] Son of a bitches. Fire! [explosion] Take us out of the trees. Hell yeah? Hell yeah. Hell yeah! ALL: Hell yeah! Defensive positions, move! Go, go, go. Forward! [suspenseful music] Fire! Now! [gunshots] We'll finish this. Forward! MAN (OVER RADIO): Red one, red one, we have visual. We are engaging. [triumphant music] [explosion] [cheering] Yeah! Oh, yeah. Woo! That was the red tails. Red tails? Tuskegee airmen. Negro pilots. [cheering] Men, you are the first Negro tankers to ever fight in the American army. I never would have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are as long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sons of bitches. Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Don't let them down. And, damn you, don't let me down. They say it is patriotic to die for your country. Well, let's see how many patriots we can make out of those Germans sons of bitches. [cheering] Detail 910, move. At arms. We're going, gentlemen. Creasy. This is him, sir. Sergeant Creasy, I understand from my men that if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here. Thank you. Sure. [emotional music] Carry on. Thank you. Everybody, back to work. SOLDIERS: Yes, sir. Now you look like a proper officer. Looking good. And that's thanks to you, Lieutenant. They sending you back to the Air Corps? I still got one more plane to make ace. I have no doubt you'll do it. I will never forget. Take care, brother. You too. [engine starts]
