Boys of Galilee, behold, my glorious catch. - You. - (shouting and laughing) Peter, just in time, since you're empty handed, maybe you and your little brother can help me with my huge net of fish. You tangled our nets, and you stole our fishing spot. - Who on earth would do such a thing? - Your spot? I had no idea you own the entire Galilee Peter. - Hey, at least I own my own boat. - That is our boat. - Sure sons of Zebedee. - What's that supposed to mean? - Everybody knows your father owns that boat, just like everything else (mumbling). - Yeah, everything except for these fish. These belong to me. - You never know when to quit, do you? - Never. - Take them up. - [Peter] No. - Alrighty then. Away we go. (grunting and shouting) - Ooh. - Aah - Out of the way. - Don't move. (vocalizing) (shouting) (dramatic music) - And stay out. - I'm sorry. Get back here! - Hey Pity, I got a little something for you. (shouting) (sighs) - My name's not Pity. - Peter and you quit. - (mumbling)Let's go right now. - No, here they come. (shouting) - Get out of the way. - Lets go. - No, - Sorry.

Is that my reflection I see? - Sons of Thunder. Yeah! (scowling) - Ma, what are you doing? - This is not how I raised my sons. - No mother, I was trying to-- (smack) (laughing) - So, you think this is funny, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, (mumbling) - Ow ow ow. - Where are your fish Abba? - Malachi not now. - And why are your nets so empty? - Because the thieves, the thieves of Galilee, they stole my fish. - What is wrong with you? - (sighs) Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. - You call fistfights nothing, you call lashing out on everyone around you including your wife, nothing? - I'm not lashing out. - You are right now. We're drowning Peter. - Well, fine. I'll get these nets back in order, and in the morning, I'll bring you back a net full of fish, you watch. - It's not about the fish. - Not about the fish? Rachel, we sing songs about it. A net full of fish make sure king of the dock. More fish means more money, and more money means-- - what? It means what? food on our table, clothes on our back or another boat. Those things matter but Peter, - It means I'm worth something. What matters the most to me, is how full these nets are. I need to get back to work. - We'll help you untie those knots. - No, I could do it on my own. - But I want to help papa. - I don't need anyone's help. Rachel, Malachi. - Let us know, when we matter. - What are you gonna squawk at me too? Huh? (shouting) Of course. (groans) (sentimental music) - You're going to give him your coat. - Ah (clears throat) Have you seen his hat? (chuckles) - I gave him more than that. - Do I know you, huh? And why are you standing in my boat? - Your net's empty Peter. - Oh, that is very observant of you, you must be a prophet. - It's empty, even when it's full of fish. That means you're ready. - What are you? What do you mean I'm ready? Ready for what? - Go out into the deep. - (chuckles sarcastically) the deep. Look, teacher. I don't know who you are or how you think you know me. But if you don't mind, I need to figure this out. On my own. - The boat is sailing son of John. You're gonna miss it. - [Andrew] Peter what's he doing in our boat? - Hey,(shouting) - Hey look, Peter is back at it again. (laughing) - Oh, I gotta see this. - Hey, Pete, while we're out there, maybe you can catch my missing sandal. (laughing) Aha. - Peter, where are you going? - And who's that with him? - Are you ready, Peter? - Sure. (groaning) - Row, row. - We're here. - Here? I just spent three hours in this exact place. It's an empty sea. - That's not exactly true. Throw your net Peter. On the right side of the boat. - Oh, on the right side! (laughing) You don't do a lot of fishing, do you? - No. - So, What do you do? - Carpentry? - Really? I can't believe I'm doing this. - You never did know when to quit. (birds chirping, slow music) Look. - If you're trying to completely humiliate me, - and it's working. (dramatic music) (laughing and celebrating) - It's just another day a sea. For the boys of Galilee. - Have you ever seen anything like this? - You got to start dancing, or help me out here? (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Yeah, (laughs) (sobbing) - I don't know who you are, but you must leave at once. I'm just a fisherman from Galilee. A sinner, unworthy to be in your presence. - Peter, follow me, and I will make you a fisher of men. Andrew, follow me. James and John, Sons of Thunder. Follow me. - Yes I will. - Me too Peter. - Come on. All right, - our net is so full. (laughing) - Guess who it is? - He's the king of the dock. - Andrew, I think he's more than that. (shouting) (slow sentimental music) - How are you doing that? - I don't know, the food just keeps coming. - And so do the people. - Look, that's the boy, the boy with the miracle basket. That's him. (dramatic music) (vocalizing) - Jesus did this papa. - We don't need any more. Everyone has more than enough. Please don't disturb the teacher. - Hey, I knew this would happen. Parents, please, - Let the children come. Don't ignore any of these little ones. Unless you become like these little children, humble and full of faith, faith even as small as the seed of a mustard flower, you can never come into the kingdom of heaven. (chuckles) The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. The Father has sent me to bring good news to you, to heal the brokenhearted, to tell you all that the captives will be set free, the blind will see, the lame walk, and the hurting, will be rescued. (sighs) Thank you. Children look at these flowers. They don't make their clothing. Yet even the Great King Solomon was not dressed as beautifully as they are. So if God cares so much for flowers that are here today and gone tomorrow, don't you think he cares for you too? - Yes. - Oh, and look, look at these birds. Look at how the Father has provided for them. Why should you worry about what to eat and drink. Your Father already knows your needs. Seek the heart of God above everything else. And He will gladly give you what you need. - What is the heart of God? - Yes. - What is the heart of God? Have you ever heard the story of the lost son? - No. - No? Would you children like to hear a story? - Yes. - All right. (laughter) - Well, there was a kind and wealthy farmer, who had two sons that he loved very much. He poured his life into them. Well, these two boys were very different from each other. The older son never cared about life beyond the farm. He was satisfied working in his father's land. And he looked forward to the day, when his own sons might take it over. But not so with the youngest. He wanted nothing more than to go into the world and indulge in everything it had to offer. - Why won't you just let me go? - There'll be a day when you can make that decision for yourself. But I love you my son, and I want what's best for you. Do you trust me? - What? - Dark thoughts crept into his heart. He started to question if he could trust his father. - If he truly loves me, he'll give me what I want. - So the younger son made up his mind and asked his father for his share of the family wealth. Though his heart was breaking, the father relented. He gave his son the money and watched this willful boy set out on his own. - Come home soon. - This is goodbye, father. - He actually left, I can't believe it. - I knew this day would come. - Do you think I'll ever come back? - I'll always be waiting. (slow sad music) - Time passed, weeks turned into months, and months turned into seasons. Life on the farm continued as normal. However, the father had not heard from his youngest son, since the day he left. His father longed to hold him in his arms and protect him like he did when he was just a boy. But his son had to choose and all the father could do was watch, and wait. Sadly, the thing the father feared most came true. His son spent all of his inheritance on reckless living and could barely get by. About this time, a severe famine hit the land. (sighs) Now penniless and homeless, he went and hired himself out to a local pig farmer. As he sat out among the swine, his empty stomach ground, he scrounged through the mud for scraps of food, fighting the pigs for anything edible. It was at this moment, he realized, how far he had fallen. - What has become of me? (sighs) Even my father's servants have shelter and more than enough food. (whimpers) Look at me. (weeps) look at me. I miss my father. I miss you father. - So, the young man arose from his filth, he began his long journey home. Weak, barefoot and broken, he came within sight of the old homestead. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him. - My son! - Father! - My son. (sobbing) - father, I have sinned against God and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. - But you are my son, nothing will ever change that. - I love you. - And I love you. (soft joyful tunes) (mumbling) - Eat and celebrate, well you were dead but now you're alive. You were lost but now you are found. Haman, - Yes master, - Kill the fattened calf. - Look my son is home. - Yes. - Praise God. - My friends. That is the heart of your heavenly Father. - Teacher, how should we pray to Him? - Please teach us how to pray, - yes how do you pray? - When you pray to your Abba, your Father, pray like this, "Our Father in heaven. "May your name be kept holy. "May your kingdom come, "and your will be done, "on earth as it is in heaven. "Give us what we need today. "And forgive us of our sins "as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us. "Don't let us give in to temptation "but rescue us from the evil one. "For yours is the kingdom "and the power and the glory "forever." Amen. - Amen. - You agree then. - Yes (laughs) (instrumental music) - I must go and bring this good news to others. Blessings to all of you and remember, if you had ears to hear, I can hear, if you have eyes to see, let them see. (sighs throughout the congregation) - Jesus, if we wanna get to Jerusalem in time for Passover, we need to be on our way. - Yes, you're always thinking ahead, but first I'd like to stop at Martha's house before we get into Jerusalem. - Aah, I was hoping he would say that. - Why? Because Mars is a better cook than Rachel. - (shushing) I never said that. - No, but you meant it. (laughs) - Oh, how sweet, looks at them Rachel, they're like new men. I haven't even seen them fight since they started following Jesus. - Because they stopped fighting themselves. - It's a leper, go. - Run (sobs) - It's a leper, everyone clear away, - get Jesus away from him. - Master, let's go this way. - No. - Master don't, I can't let you touch him, this disease is a death sentence. - What is your name? - Unclean. But if you are willing, - You can make me clean again. - What? No, master stay back. - Jesus do not touch him. - John, - What is he doing? (shouting) - Your faith has made you clean. (slow suspenseful music) - Oh, my face. Am I healed? (weeping) - Praise be to God. Praise be to God! Praise be to God! (gasps) (laughs) (shouting) Praise be to God! - Master you just-- - I did. - Yeah, but he wasn't-- - He was, - Ah, - John (audience laughing) sing the Passover song. - Okay Let's go to Jerusalem.

(sigh) - I'm so excited to hear the latest news. What's been happening? - Where do we begin? He just fed 5000 men, plus the women and children with five loaves of bread and two fish. Healed a leper, raised a child from the dead and delivered this Magdalene woman here from seven demons. Say hi. - Hi. - (laughs) My name is Mary. What's your name? - Mary, - Mary!

But before you run off you need to wash your hands. (dog barking) - Lazarus. - Come with us. - That boy does not sit still for a minute. He is just like his father. - That's just the way John was, always off on some adventure. But oh, what a sweet boy. Just the opposite of James. - How so? - Mr. Know-it-all, that one. Always had an answer for everything. I worn my belt out on his behind. (laughs) - I bet Jesus never gave you any trouble, Mary. (giggles) - What was that face? - Okay, (talking over each other) - Come on, you have to tell. Tell us everything. - Well, when Jesus was about Malachi's age, we were traveling back with the caravan from Jerusalem after Passover. And I assumed he was with Joseph. And Joseph assumed he was with me. So you can imagine how shocked we were, when we realized he wasn't with either of us. (laughs) - I would have ripped in the head. - Where was he? - Oh, finally found him three days later back in Jerusalem, - Jerusalem? - And he never told you or Joseph, he was going back? - No, I would have ripped him a hand. (giggles) - He was at the temple teaching the rabbis. - God instructed Moses, to put the blood of the rams, over the doorways of their homes, so that death can pass over them. - Yes for the covering of our sins. - But if the blood of the Passover lamb, forgives the sins of the people. Why must we sacrifice it every year? - The Passover lamb must be sacrificed every year because there is no permanent cure for man's sin. Therefore, we must always provide a lamb to be slain. Just as the law requires. - Have you forgotten, that God told Abraham, "I, will provide the lamb, " and through him, " all of the nations of the earth will be blessed." - This boy speaks with authority and wisdom. - Oh, you're speaking of the Messiah. - Yes. - Our Messiah will come as a warrior, conquering the nations and restoring glory to Israel. - No, He will come as God's lamb to be sacrificed, so it'll break the power of sin, that separates man from God, once and for all. - Amazing! How does this boy speak like this? - It sounds as if you know Him. Tell me boy. If you know so much about the Messiah, Who is He? - Oh, Jesus, oh! They were amazed by him. But Joseph and I were too upset to care. We scolded him right there in front of the Pharisees. - What did he do? - He just looked up at me and said, "Didn't you know you'd be in my father's house?" - That's it? (audience laughing) That's all he said? (screeching) - Well, I'll tell you one thing. If that were James or John, I would have grabbed him by the ears, and whooped (clapping) that little behind. (laughter) especially if it were James. Hmm hmm, I would have grabbed the entire caravan and made them do a public apology, for turning my hair gray and making his father go bald. (laughter) Yes ma'am listen, I would have even made him apologize to the donkey. For having it walk all the way back to Jerusalem. (audience laughing) - Oh, and then what? - Then I would have told that little boy Jesus, - What? Ama? - That God chose the right woman to be your mother. (laughter) - That he did. - Put me down. - Ama'. Martha, my home away from home. - Jesus, oh! You are skin and bones, now come sit, I just made fig cakes. Mary go get the fig cakes. We can't stay for long, Peter's keeping us on a very tight schedule. - Hey, get out of my kitchen. You all are like a pack of jackals. Now, there is more in the oven. Get out James. (slow sentimental music) - Mary, now Mary, I just asked you to go get the... Jesus, don't you think it's unfair that my sister just sits there while I do all the work, tell her to come and help me. - Martha, there's only one thing was being concerned about. And Mary has found it, and it will not be taken away from her. Besides, I never really liked your cooking, (gasps) I love it. - Jesus! - Jesus, - There he is, Lazarus. - Jesus (laughs) - Hey, you've gotten taller. - Oh and stronger. - What has Martha been feeding you? - What hasn't she been feeding him? - Lazarus come with us to Jerusalem if it's alright with your sisters. - All right? Oh, please get him out of here. You know, every day his friends from the city come and guess who has to feed them? Me, hey, go raid their cupboards for once, and then come back here and rest. - All right, we need to be on our way. - Be safe. - Goodbye Mary.

He was born blind, God's curse is on him. - All right mama. - Teacher. Why was this man born blind? Is it because of his own sins or his parents sins? - Neither. This happened so that the power of God could be seen in him. This man lives in darkness but today, Judas, he will see the light. - Shekel, have mercy, just one shekel sir. (spits) (murmuring) No, what are you doing? Please don't shame me more, please. - Now go and wash yourself in the pool of Siloam. - The healing pool? - Yes.

Get out of here. - Peter, (murmuring) (clanking sound) - Caiphus, your Holiness. - Caiphus, I can assure, we will deal with the man who did this. - One man did all this? - We pursued the vandal Sir, but lost him and his gang of Galileans in the crowd. - Here some of the men who were with him. - I did not participate in this rebellion, I can assure you. - A fish out of water. You Galileans have a certain smell about you. - We're not all Galilean, sir. - No. - What's your name? - Judas Iscariot. I am a successful merchant who has done a lot of business. Right here actually. - Judas, please tell those lowly net casters that there are no fish here for them to draw into that rebellious delusion. - An empty sea. - What did you say? (groans) - (mumbling) fishermen call an empty sea. (clanking sound) - What is your name? - Peter. - Peter, - Yeah. - I will have your leader caged for what he has done. Tell him we will be watching, (groans) and to never enter God's house again. Word of advice fisherman go back to your boat and abandon this cause, religion has no place for someone like you. - If this is what your religion is, then I have no place for it. - Judas, a wise merchant knows when to cut his losses. (footsteps approaching) (groan) - Isn't this the beggar from the gate? - Well, it looks like him. But it can't be him, he's blind. - He was found at the pool of Siloam causing trouble, claiming Jesus of Nazareth healed him of his blindness. - Who is Jesus of Nazareth? - That's the man who did this. - Some say he is a rabbi, but I heard he's merely the son of a carpenter. - You are the blind beggar aren't you? - Yes, I am. Or I was. Yes, you're Nicodemus, you put many coins in my cup over the years. - How do we know this man is telling the truth? - I am his mother, I can testify that this is my son and he was born blind. - Yes, but how can he now see? - He is old enough to speak for himself, ask him. - Enough. (bang) - We will give God the glory for this healing. But let there be no confusion, this Jesus is a sinner. Who causes others to sin. - I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. But I do know this, I was blind and now I can see. I recognize your walk. Every day for years, I heard you walk right by me but Jesus stopped and saw me. - How did he heal you? - Ask the one who sent Him. - And who do you believe sent Him? - God. (shouting) - Let this place know, Nicodemus, gather your staff and get this mess cleaned up before morning. It's going to be business as usual. (slow sentimental music) - And when He comes, He'll open the eyes of the blind and plug the ears of the deaf, - and the lame will leap like a deer. And those who cannot speak will sing for joy. - Isaiah's prophecy, could it be, in our lifetime Joseph? - It has to happen in somebody's lifetime Nic. Why not ours? - Who do you think He is? - A carpenter, who continues to fulfill every prophecy written about the Messiah.

But first you must be born again. - How can a grown man like me be born again? - Do you feel that? (rustling of the wind) You can hear the wind rustling through the leaves. You don't know where it came from or where it's going. That's how the Spirit of God is. People can only reproduce human life. But the Spirit of God gives birth to spiritual life.

It comes from what you believe. - Well then help me understand. - God loves the world Nicodemus. He wants his children back. All of them. - Even those who do not obey the law? God is holy, He condemned sin. - You're right. So there must be a sacrifice that will pay for men's sins once and for all. - There is no Passover lamb able to cover man's sin once and for all. Sacrifice like that would have to be perfect. Like God Himself. (wind whistling) (whispering) Like God Himself. - Nicodemus, what are you doing out here? - Fresh air. - It is rather stuffy in there. - Well, we've already met with the Roman commander. - We have a plan to track this Nazarene. - It seems this Jesus has been causing trouble all over Israel. - We are meeting again, in a few minutes at synagogue. - We can expect you to be there. - Yes, of course.

(laughter) - How much do you hear us say? - I heard you talking about the older brother. What do you mean? Remember the story I told about the wealthy farmer's son who rebelled and ran away, but then returned to his father? - Yes. - Of course. - I never told you how the older brother responded. Instead of rejoicing, he grew in jealousy toward his little brother and bitterness toward his father. He didn't want to accept that someone who broke all the rules of sinful living should be welcomed back home. Such celebration. - The Pharisees? - You have eyes to see John and let them see. - The Pharisees are acting like the older brother. - The rebel son gets the fattened calf, you're suggesting that Almighty God welcomes back any sinner no matter what they've done. - He does more than that Judas, he goes after them. He's like a good shepherd who has, say, 100 sheep. If one of them wandered off and was lost, the shepherd would leave the 99 others and go into the darkness to search for that one. And when the shepherd found it, he would rescue it, embrace it, and joyfully carry all the way home. When he returns home, he would call together his friends and his neighbors saying, "rejoice with me, "because I have found the one that was lost." In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over 99 others who don't need to repent. - Where exactly are we going? (pigs snorting) - Galilee. - Galilee? No, this is the wrong side of the Galilee for the Jews, Peter. It's full of pigs and Gentiles. - It's where the master wants us to go. - So we go. - Are those graves? With Gentiles, pigs and the dead? Well, great. Let's just break all the laws of Moses while we're at it. Hey, everyone, let's drink a cup of blood from a strangled goat.

Jesus is here. - Why weren't you here when they needed you? - Surround the master, keep watch. - What good are your miracles now? - Peter, it's Martha, let her through. - Oh my Lord. My Lord there was nothing that I could do. I knew that he was sick. But he wouldn't listen when I told him to rest. We sent for you. If you had been here, he would not have died. - Martha, I am the resurrection and the life. Do you believe this? - Yes, Lord. - Where's Mary? - No, she's at home grieving deeply. She doesn't understand why you weren't here sooner. - Bring her to me. - Yes. (sighs) - Look at them over there. Like vultures. They must have known we were coming. - Jesus, you'll take the time to heal sinners, Gentiles and degenerates. But what about her own friend? - Hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. Beautiful on the outside, but filled with dust on the inside. How will you appear so righteous but your hearts are full of greed, control and power? - And who do you think you are? Nazarene. - My Lord, why did you not come? - Jesus when his sister sent for you. - I'm here now. Where'd they put him? - Lord come and see. (weeping) - Look, even Jesus weeps for Lazarus. - He healed a blind man. Couldn't he have kept Lazarus, his own friend from dying? - Death. - What is he saying? - He's praying to his father the devil, no doubt. - Yes to speak up, teacher. So we can all hear what you have to say. - Roll the stone aside. (shouting) - Roll the stone aside. - How dare you? Do not show Lazarus like this. - No, Lord he's been dead for four days. - No, this is too far. - No, the smell will be terrible. This is not what the Lazarus would want. - Martha, didn't I tell you that I am the resurrection and the life? - Thomas, you heard Him let's go. - Father, thank you for hearing me. I knows that you always hear me but I'm saying this, so that everyone can believe that you are the one who sent me. I am the resurrection and the life (shouting) (coughing) (flies buzzing) - Lazarus, arise. - People can't you see? He's a deceiver. A carpenter who says he comes from Heaven.

I don't have time for chasing after stupid sheep. (horse's hoof padding away) - This Jesus, is turning Jerusalem upside down. - Cauiphus has called for an emergency assembly. (dramatic music) - Just a few days it is my sacred duty to perform the Passover sacrifice for the people. To offer a perfect lamb to Jehovah God on their behalf. But I think the recent blasphemous sins of the people, maybe too great for God's mercy, we need an even greater sacrifice. - Do you mean to kill this Nazarene? - Isn't it better if one man dies rather than a whole nation? This Jesus of Nazareth is leading the people away from God. It's straight to their destruction. As high priest the Lord speaks to me, and I believe it is His will and my solemn duty to remove this threat permanently. - [Priest] All of us agree. - But we've tried to trap him into saying or doing something illegal, but still, he will not stumble. - Jesus is a rebel who calls Himself God. Isn't that reason enough? - Yes. - We just need to prove he is also a danger to Rome. We need to capture him. - Yes. - Try Him - Yes. - And do away with him. - Yes. - Is it legal to convict a man before he is given a hearing? - who said that? (footsteps approaching) - You cannot put him on trial without cause. - Without cause Nicodemus? Are you blind? (laughing) - Not anymore. - Neither am I. - Joseph. You have all people would follow a man who eats with sinners, touches lepers, keeps company with prostitutes? - Jesus shows the people what He's for. Instead of just what he's against. - The Prophets have all done far stranger things Cauiphus, you know that. Isaiah wandered the land naked for three years. Hosea married a prostitute. Ezekiel like barley cakes cooked with excrement. - But everything they did pointed to God. Everything is son of a carpenter does points to-- - (shouts) Love. Love. Everything Jesus does points to love. I have pored over the scriptures and I have found this, the law is love, God is love. - The love of God is reserved for those who keep the law. - Yes. - You burden the people with rules but you never lift a finger to help them. You don't care about God's love, all you care about is the law. So you can control them. And you, you play God so that others are forced to look up to you. - Nicodemus I demand you to be silent. - Always want to measure everyone's righteous, you cannot measure God's love. - [Cauiphus] Nicodemus. - That is why Jesus Himself said that prostitutes and sinners are closer to heaven than any of us. (shouting) - Silence (bang) (clanging sounds) - Tell me, if this man is all about love. Then why did one of His own betray him? - Judas. - This man testifies that Jesus manipulated the minds of simple fishermen to wander all over Israel, encouraging them to break the sacred commandments. Ask him how this King of the Jews allowed a poor destitute woman to pour a rare perfume her life savings, mind you, on his feet! Instead of giving the money to the poor. This Jesus is a glutton. He's a drunkard and a rebel. It's all beginning to collapse around this phony Messiah. This would be a very bad time to choose his side. - Too late. - You're not just turning your back on me. You're turning your back on God. - Jesus is God. (shouting) - blasphemy! - Get him now. - Jesus is God. - You promised me no one would know I betrayed him. - Tomorrow he'll be dead and his followers are one back to the boat in Galilee. Why do you care what they think? Do you still believe? - I believe I just wasted three years of my life on that man. - Bring Jesus to us, and redeem those wasted years Judas.

You just happen to be there when others were following him. (chattering) - how can you even say that? We were there for one of his first big miracle. You weren't. - Yeah, and that miracle happened in my boat. You don't even own your own boat. (shouting in argument) - Silence. You will all run away tonight and leave me alone. Peter, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me. - Lord, if I even have to die with you, I will not deny you. - My friends. I don't call you servants, because a servant doesn't know what his master is doing. Everything that the Father has said to me, I have shared with you. You are my friends, and I love you. And now, I am giving you a new commandment, love one another, in the same way that I have loved you, it's by your love for each other that the world will know that you were my followers. Greater love, has no one in this, than to lay down His life for His friends. My friends in a little while you will no longer see me. (chattering) Don't be afraid, I will not leave you alone. After I'm gone, my Father will send the Holy Spirit, and he will fill you and comfort you and give you direction, with the Holy Spirit, you and every believer after you will bring glory to my Father. In this way, I will always be with you. But now I must go, and prepare a place for you so that where I am, my friends you can also be. - But Lord, we don't know where you're going. How can we know the way? - I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. - Please don't leave. I want you to stay with us. - If I do not go, the Holy Spirit cannot come to you. I'll tell you the truth, if you believe in me, you will be able to do the things that I have done and even greater things. This can only happen if I go and be with my Father. In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart, I have overcome the world. Come my Friends, it's time to go.

The Lord said, "In the last days I will pull up my spirit upon all people. "And everyone who calls on "the name of the Lord will be saved." As you well know, God performed powerful miracle through Jesus of Nazareth, but with the help of Rome, you nailed him to a cross and killed him! But God raised Him from the dead, so that we could be raised from death to life. Jesus became our Passover lamb once and for all, so that everyone in Israel know that God has made Jesus to be the Lord and Messiah. He's alive in us, and he can live in you too. This is how you can be pardoned then. This is the only way to enter heaven. - How? - How can we saved? - Turn away from your sins and turn to God, accept Jesus as your Savior and be baptized.

(drum roll) (applause) (soft sentimental music) - We present the story in a fresh new way, in a very unexpected way and to peel back some layers on Jesus and do it justice. - The most challenging part of creating the show was definitely picking and choosing which moments you want to use to create one big story as opposed to something that feels like a lot of little stories and then finding a way to connect all of these memorable events. But also, we want to capture how personal He was, and how good of a friend and a teacher He was to each individual person. It's very interesting to have a lead character in a story that doesn't have any flaws, but there are plenty of people around Him who have glaring flaws. - This show is bursting with life, adventure and the unexpected. This is not a retelling of a familiar story at all. The way that we portray some of these miracles is so fun, so adventurous, so whimsical. - [Kristen] This show is going to be bright, colorful. It's going to be exciting. You're going to feel like you're on the adventure with Jesus and with the disciples. That's exactly what it is. It's an adventure. It's a journey. - So he's a guy that rolled up his sleeves, strapped on his sandals, crossed the stormy sea, climbed a mountain, to remind one person, how valuable they are to God. And that is the heart of the story. It's a story about love that rescues, it's a story about no matter where you have been in life, or where you currently are or where you might find yourself. It's never too stormy, too dark, too ugly, too messy for Jesus, to reach down just like He did with Peter and grabbed him by the hand and pull him up out of the water as he's drowning from the woes of life. That's the story. That's the heart of the story. This show like no other embodies why we do this at Sight and Sound and it's our heart that you'll experience this show and that you'll experience Jesus in a way that you never have before, in a different way that's more personal and relational and intimate. (sentimental music) (upbeat music) - When we decided to do the show of Jesus going to Israel, that was one of the first ideas that the look put on my heart. If I'm going to lead this, the team, and experience the Holy lands. This is the show to do that with, - The purpose of this trip was to inspire our design team and some of our story team members, in the life of Jesus, but ultimately in what the land of the Bible is. One of the big surprises for us over there creatively was, it seems as though every reference that we have on the holy lands, everything seems so rocky and dusty and dead, where it was around Galilee. There's a, landscape is beautiful. Anything north of that is green and lush. - [Steph] When I first saw the Sea of Galilee, I remember thinking it was smaller. - I didn't expect to see the other side. - The Sea of Galilee is kind of that center point that everything hits and collides. It tended to make sense that you could create in this valley all these waves and this commotion that you read the Scripture about Christ calming the storm. For me, there was a lot of locations that you could immediately tie with the people in the Bible. I remember just spending time walking around Carpharnahum thinking, while Peter was here, and Jesus was here. - There were some beautiful motifs in some of the architecture, I'm pretty sure that the artists used some of that in in their application to what we ended up putting on the stage. - [Glen] And the hills behind Carpharnaum are just blanketed with these yellow flowers. You have the mustard seeds and the color in the yellow really started impact story about Sermon on the Mount, and how we would help people associate with that location and bring them into that scene. - The big challenge on stage rolling hills. So what we did was we covered a big portion of the stage with terrain to really give a moment like we would have experienced in Israel that Jesus would have been walking and teaching in. - [Steph] Part of the story particularly that Josh wanted to tell about the travel and walking and you do get a little dirty walking around, but it's okay because that's just, it's just part of what life was like there. - [Josh] And there was a lot of fellowship and teaching a long the way. We try to reflect that in the story. - When I look at the show that we've designed, I'm transported back to Israel, through the things that we have designed there. And one of those places is the Garden of Gethsemane. We have created some beautiful olive trees. - You know, when you look at an olive press being worked and all the ropes tightening around those olives and just squeezing every ounce of oil from that, you think about the Jesus the Son of Man just being pressed like an olive press in Gethsemane, which means olive press. - [Lisa] We patterned the set piece, we were actually calling it the Garden Tomb after that location, and you'll see there's beautiful greenery there because we wanted it to feel as though it's a place of hope in life. - [Josh] I think we achieved the goal in creating those experiences together and then being able to follow up on it, coming back and having the conversations around what we experienced together, then impacted story and design. - [Lisa] When you're experiencing that land, it teaches you so much about the Bible. That was so important for us because we want to bring the Bible to life here. For our design team members and our story team members to experience that actual location. I think it has greatly impacted our shows here, and it's just going to continue to influence our shows in the future. - We are here in London, where we are recording our latest soundtrack for our newest production Jesus. (classical music) - This is my third show working with Don Harper. Together we did Joseph and then Moses. And now we're doing the Jesus show. And without us saying it, we know that, this is, you know, our most important work together. It's funny, I explained to Don, about a year ago, I said, "Okay, I want it to be whimsical, "but mature and mature wimzie." He's like, "How do you do that? "What does that even mean?" I was like, "I don't know." But we don't want it to be so heavy handed. Want to have life and adventure in it. And I think we struck it. (instrumental music) The emphasis that we put on this particular show and this score has been on a whole another level. As a director, when you start sinking your teeth into the actual events of the story, and then those events start to get strung together. The character of Christ comes out in every single note, and every single phrase of music and score and every moment is a significant moment. There's no filler, it's all emotion. It's all passion. It's an incredibly cinematic score. I think this thing tells a story without any lyrics even being attached to it. So that was really our intent the whole time, was "Let's create something that continually "leans forward and that the audience are truly "getting something fresh and original "and a different angle on this very familiar story." I can't imagine anybody but Don and the London musicians and recording at Abbey Road Studios, I can't imagine a better place to have all that come into fruition. Most meaningful and critical points in the process when you assemble everything and put the score together, and you record those takes. And you hear this woodwinds and you hear those strings and you hear the brass come together so beautifully. It's takes you to a whole different place, it's unbelievable and when music and truth come together. There's nothing more powerful than that, to move people to a place of honest evaluation of what this is all about. (instruments playing) - A lot of our animals we'll use target training. So we'll start wherever the animals gonna end up. We'll put the animal just a couple inches away, have them touch the target, they get a click a tree. And then once that's done, they start getting there patterns. Then we'll start to implement like noise and the lights and fog and energy and we have to get trust with all the animals no matter what animal's on stage, there's an element of trust. The scene that has the most animals in our show, I believe is the temple scene. There's animals running in every direction, they're running out the aisle, they running across stage, birds will be flying. It has baby doll sheep, Jacob sheep, Sana goats, Nubian goats, birds, two donkeys. So that scene has a lot of animals in them. - Alright, so temple clearing is about to happen. This is the scene where all of these sheep and goats and donkeys. Run through the aisles. When Jesus releases them, it's really cool because I get to be in the back of the house where these paths cross of sheep and goats. And it has this really cool dance because one's going this way. One's going this way a donkey is running up this aisle, but they do it because they're so well trained. (soft music) - This it , Jesus ruining God's Kingdom - [Jesus] Get out. - [Disciple] Wanna die with him? No way. - [John] He doesn't want us to fight, nit like this. - This is the end of the day, these ones are done. - In our story, there's a lot of traveling going on. So we'll have some donkeys that'll be pulling carts. We have one donkey for the triumph entry, that Jesus has to ride. We have, four Cooney Cooney pigs and then we have I think eight part Cooney Cooney part potbelly pigs. - We're gonna be loading the prodigal pigs onto the setpiece and getting them out on the stage. They're really motivated by food. So getting them onto a set piece where they eat and then getting them back into the room where they eat there, it's really easy, so it's really fun though because you get to see them run around and have fun. So we feed them nice and slowly because we're gonna be out on the set for maybe a minute 30 seconds. So we want them to be eating and facing the audience. - The animals can definitely influence the emotion of the scene. We have so many unique animals that people just have never seen before. So to see them live up close, I think is a special thing. - We have been shooting our shows for over a decade now. So we felt like it was time to really scale up the production. I'm Ryan Miller and I'm the director of the live capture of Jesus the Show. - They might show up in the middle of the scene. - Ready? - Yeah. - We pray that you be in every frame of this final product in Jesus name, amen. - All right, we're rolling. - Take one. - And act. - Lets reset, lets go back to one. - So we have three dollies, a jib, a techno crane, six cameras. I'm really excited about the techno crane. That's gonna be a new thing for us. So it'll be in the back of the house and it can reach the front of the stage with the camera. I think is gonna really show the scope and size of our theater> - Push into her. Okay, and do this and reveal then watch the scene. Just curious so he will be entering from that door almost from the top. So these are my binders. This represents about nine months of work. I have my script and my notes for Monday all day, Tuesday all day, Wednesday morning, and I have shooting scripts for Wednesday afternoon and Thursday. - And lets cut all cameras. Great job guys.
