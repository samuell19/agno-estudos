But... It'll make you sleep. But I don't want to... sleep. It'll do you good. You'll feel better. The glamor and the finery That once were women's pride Have now for the duration Been so bravely set aside It's really quite impossible To hide our admiration The girls in uniform Are now Our greatest inspiration Beauty on duty Are doing their bit Beauty on duty Are making a hit Looking so martial In uniform blue Beauty on duty It's heads up to you When victory trumpets Ring out loud and clear Beauty on duty Will savor the cheer And we'll be so darn proud We'll shout it right out loud You're the best-dressed woman of the year What's the matter? You're dreaming? Oh. A nightmare. Ah, it's our post? What gives? Get a load of this. Light shore duty. Convalescent drill, sonny. They'll soften you up for a nice, soft office job. Yeah. But I'm no invalid. There's nothing wrong with me. This is a rotten waste of time. Signals. Well, read 'em and like 'em, chump. They can't do this to me. I'm gonna tell them so. Well, look, give my love to the old man and tell him I want another week's leave. Hi, Johnny. How're you doing, boy? Hi. Is this D-block? How'd you guess it, Mac? Well, ain't he the happy character?

What do you mean "Forget it"? Look, don't mind Tommy. He can't forget he's Heaven's gift to show business. Come on. Let's call off the hostilities. What do you say? Okay. You win. You know bigger words than I do. It's this hanging around doing nothing that's getting me down. Oh, leisure. I love it. But then, I'm lazy, I guess. "Do this. Don't do that." "Hey you, at the double there, on your neck," all the time. All I do is peel potatoes. If they'd only let me milk a cow. Sitting here, waiting. It's all wrong. What's wrong about it? They know what they're doing, we just wait here till they tell us to do it. Ah, that's the spirit, Jerry. And for relaxation, we can go and dance with the pretty wrens, huh? Oh, you and your women. No barracks should be without them! Why just this afternoon, up at the ship office, I saw the most terrific blonde. Not for this kid. I'm sick of convoying seagoing jitterbugs across a dance floor.

I might still get to be an admiral. Yes, sir. The show is going to be a terrific success. Good stuff. Everything's in order, everything's top-line, sir.

I wanted to explain about the rehearsal yesterday. Well... Well, you see I'm... I'm a bit fed up with this shore duty business. You want to be doing something? Yeah, that's right. Yes. The inactivity is getting on your nerves. Exactly.Then what's wrong with being in the show? Oh. Don't bother trying to explain. I know. It's all very simple. You're plain lazy. You just don't want to work. Your piano playing would be an asset to the show and you know it. I know, but look-- Oh, don't give me an argument. Look, we need you and you refuse. You won't do a thing to help. You're the most conceited, egotistical, selfish... What? You win. Nice to... nice to know you need me. But... Well.

Dying to sing that song of his. Dear dizzy Jenny, longing to be the Navy's Joan of Arc. And Tommy, worried about his professional prestige. And lonely for his wife. Let's get married, Midge. Right away. Now. Johnny. I've asked for sea duty. I... I'm liable to go anytime. Oh, please. Don't feel that way. How do you expect me to feel, Johnny? I was afraid you wouldn't understand. Oh.

Signal, darling. Oh, signal. Oh, it'll be waiting when we get to Halifax. And you're quite happy? Oh, you're the most selfish... I hate you. Oh, look, Midge. Oh, Johnny, I... Well, what's new in show business, Tommy? Plenty. Take a look at that. Gracie said she'd make big time without me and she's done it. Well, who's this friend type? Him? Small time. As a hoofer, he'd make a good shoemaker. Well, her success must make you proud and happy. Are you married? No. No use explaining. Oh, well, he'll get used to it. Which reminds me... Wonder where Horace is. Give me a hand, will you, Perce? Okay, let's take it easy now. Why don't they put stirrups on these darn things? What you need is a horse. Oh, help, help, help. Oh, Percy. Get me out of this. I'll break my neck. Oh it's no use, Perce, I can't make it. No, you can get in there. Now take it nice and easy. Okay, once more. There it is now. That's it.

Have you got any eggs? Hen's eggs? Plenty, sailor. Plenty. Could you spare one? How would you like it cooked? Oh, I don't. Eggs disagree with me. They does? I'm allergic. Well, you mean, you don't eat them? Then how come you wants this egg? To look at. What's that? I live on a farm. I haven't seen a horse or a cow or... or a chicken since I've been in the Navy. I'm homesick. So that's why you wants the egg. Unless... unless you got a horse. Get out of here. Get out.
