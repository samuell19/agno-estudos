Fancy a bit of soldiering, do you? Why not, eh? You tell me. So what does a stretcher-bearer do? Well, you had to choose between the lad with his face full of shrapnel or the one with his legs blown off. What's your name? Tom. - And hers? - Eh? The girl. It's Katie. You joining up because of her? No. Jack! Gimme those, you little... Goodness sake! - Kids. - It's alright. So why are you doing it then? The noise out of them!

Right, you flatten him down. Then we fold him over, got to get that right there and his little legs here. There. Oh, he's a bit tricky. That's right, that's it. Now...

I would've woke you up if I'd have known. Sorry. Yeah, you... you don't understand. But... Bloody hell... You know you look like Paddington Bear with that wee briefcase, mate? Uh, yes... I've got to find my B&B. You'll be lucky. Uh, what time's the next bus? It's six. Six? Yeah, but it's... Aye, in the morning. What? Sorry, mate. Well, where am I gonna stay?

Breakfast, seven till eight. No later. And there's a £5 surcharge for every quarter of an hour that you go over checkout. Which is nine sharp. There's a fresh towel on the bed but don't use the bath cos it'll run cold by the time you fill it. Kettle's a bit temperamental. The switch is, y'know... You might have to fiddle with it. But it does work. Bathroom's down the end of the corridor. Thank you. You're the boss! Maybe later, OK? Sorry. Just needed the loo. Know where it is. Uh, I asked for room one. It's news to me. No, but I... I phoned, uh, to make sure. You're next door. But, um... - You see... - Any questions? No, no. Ooh! What've you done to your finger? Oh, it's nothing. - Doesn't look like nothing. - It's fine, it's fine. I could give you a couple of plasters for that. For a pound. Is there no way we can swap rooms? Right. Right. Two full English? - Thanks, sweetheart. - Can I get runny poached? - Sure. - Thanks. Didn't have any complaints last night, did ya? No, I didn't. What about? The noise. No. Why? Fran's a dancer. She was, uh... practising a few moves. Well, I sleep in the basement, so... How about you, mate? Sorry? Didn't disturb you last night? Leave him alone. Nothing I haven't heard before. Man of the world, eh? Been there, done that? Bought and sold the t-shirt? Stop. Bye-bye. Man of the world. Goodbye.

Right money there, love. You're a star. First day on the job. You'll get the hang of it. Ah, sorry, sorry... Thanks, pal. Seats upstairs. Are you going to the shopping centre? Thank you. Thank you. Hello, stranger. Mary. Not looking your best, are you? Something's not right. It's been a rough trip. I think I'm going to be sick. Poor thing. Don't know what's up with me. You're an old git, my love. I just want to keep my promise... Thank you. What for? Waiting. Oh, you're back with us. You're a lucky boy. Roof came right off that bus. - Oh, I've got a thing I have... - Ah-ah-ah. Um, where am I, please? Do I know you? I... Face looks familiar. Were you in here last week? No. It'll come to me. Oh, uh... My case? It's just down there by the side of you. Mr Harper, how are you? Oh, hello. How did you get that cut on your finger? I, uh... It's quite infected. Cleaned it up a bit, given you some antibiotics. Left it any later and might've been in a bit of trouble. Oh, I see, yes. I noticed some other injuries. What? How'd you get them? Well... On the way, I suppose, you know... Uh, can I go now, please? I'm... perfectly fine. - Uh, Alicia? - Yeah. The old boy in Bay 3... Oh, my bus man. I remember him now! Amazing Grace. I think we'll have to keep him in overnight. I'll call upstairs, have him booked in. OK. Mr Harper. - Yes? - Mr Harper! - Yes? - I read your medical records. Would you like to come back to the hospital? I can't do that. You're not a well man. I've got a bus to catch. What you've got is cancer. Cancer of the liver, lung and kidneys, I know. That is why you need proper medical attention. If I go back into your hospital... do you honestly think I'll ever walk out again? This isn't how it's meant to end. How what's meant to end? There's something I've got to do. Let me on my way, please. Thank you. Mr Harper, you had your bed but not your breakfast! Yes, sorry, I had no time. Our brekkies have won awards! I'm sure they have. Artisan bangers, Cotswold Legbar eggs... I just don't have an appetite, sorry. But my Celia, she's been frying up since six! It is much appreciated. - Oh, please come back! - I can't. - She'll do her nut. - No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You don't know what she's like when she's angry! Tickets and passes, please! Tickets and passes. You got your pass there, fella? Yes. What's this? It's my bus pass. - No, no, no. - What's up with it? Well, this is only valid in Jockland. - Is it? - And selected routes as you cross the border into civilisation. - What? - England, to you. Yes, but I... No, I've been on... Off the bus! One, two... three, four... Oh. I'm taking buses here. Where have you come from? John o' Groats. Let me look at that. You've bunked 300-and-odd miles. I had no idea. - Off. - Oi! He's hurt himself! - Give him a break. - He's an old man. I'll pay for his ticket. - What, for the last ten journeys? - I'll organise a whip-round. Then I'll enforce the "no inflatables" rule. No, thank you. I'll pay for myself. This is ridiculous! We are going nowhere till Methuselah's got off! Come on, fella. Take your hands off of my case. - Off. - Hitler. What's he done to you? An old man! You can't just abandon him here. That's really nice. Well done, you. What are you doing out here, middle of nowhere? Waiting for a bus. Of course you are. Get in the van. No, I'd rather... You turn down help from Ukrainian, you break heart. Got no idea where I'm going, have you? I haven't got time for this. I am Andrey. Igor, Bogdan. Tom. Tom. I think I know you. I doubt it. Definitely. If you say so. You are brave man. Me? No. No, no, no. You must come eat with us. No, honestly. Thank you, but if you could just drop me - in the next town... - We are having a party. I'm not in the mood for a party, thank you, I... It is my wife birthday. You cannot say no. Exactly. Give him a drink. Oh, the bus! Thomas! I'm Maria. Hello, Maria. You must drink! Oh, uh... Well, I'm not much of a drinking man these days. Oh, oh! - Thank you. - So, you go to Ends of Land? - Sorry? - On your bus! Oh, Land's End. That's what I said. Mary? Oh, Mary! Mary... Mary? My case... Where... where's my case? Can I have that back? Please, give it to me... Give me the case! I'm sorry. Sorry, boys... Thomas. Please wait. No, Maria... If I don't go now, I... I don't think I'll be able to make it. Wait. Please. Please take this. Oh, no, I don't need that. Take it anyway. Well, that's... that's very kind. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, slowcoach! - What? - Over there. Is that him? If any of our lovely listeners are out and about on a bus today keep your eyes peeled for a mystery pensioner on his travels from John o' Groats to Land's End. If you spot him, say hello or even text me a photo. Your number one hit station in town. What you doing? I've got to give you... Your money's no good on here, mate. Go on. What? Oh, alright then. Thank you. Thanks. Right, thank you. Oh! No, no, no. Take a seat. Any seat. Thank you. It's alright. Alright. I say, there! What you doing out here? - You got a problem? - Back on the bus, pal. Can you fix it? Come on. Can you fix it? I'm not Bob the Builder. I was a mechanic. I gotta phone the depot. No, you don't understand. I'm running out of time, please! Please, please, try it. Please. Knock yourself out. Get up there and turn it over. Right, try now! You did it! You bloody did it! As far as we can go. Our... Our baby. Goodbye, my darling. Come on, slowcoach! Mad woman. Pregnant, mad woman. I love you, Tom. Alright? What are you all doing here? We're here for you! Put that down. Have some respect. Uh... Right... Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me... Love you, Mary. Ready?
