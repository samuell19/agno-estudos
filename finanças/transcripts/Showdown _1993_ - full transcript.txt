(mysterious music) - [Officer On Radio] Unit 22, we copy on the 10-48. Two juveniles identified reported missing, request 1019-- - Here, have one. I got your favorite. - Chocolate, eh? - Mhm. Chocolate. Ow. Damn, that's hot! (laughing) Perfect start to another wonderful day as one of America's promised, God bless America. (laughing) What, what are you laughing at? What's the problem? - Spinelli, every time we start patrol, you're always complaining. If you don't like the job, why don't you quit? - Why, I'll miss the excitement of getting shot at every day. Which reminds me. Wear it! - Hey, you know I don't like those things. - You never know. - Only for you, Spinelli. - [Officer On Radio] Disturbance on 6th and Main. PR states a lot of noise, and bottles being broken. - Car 14 proceeding. (guitar music) (crowd gasps) - Sick, my brother! Hey, hi. Look at this little section here. (hard rock music) - Hey, come on, Max. - Are you making trouble for my little brother? - Come on, he's grabbing the girl. - Messing with my little brother is like messing with me. - [Spinelli] What'd I tell you? Another wonderful day. You can break it up now. - No, come on back, you've got plenty of room. (loud bang) Whoa, that's good. - Looks like we're giving a few rides home tonight. - You handle this, I'll check inside. Hey, Michael. Come over here. - Me? - Yeah, you. - Hey, Officer Grant. How's it hanging? - What do you mean how's it hanging? - Oh, nothing, nothing. (glass breaks) (kid burps) - Put your feet together. - Next time you have a party, I'd appreciate an invite. - Stop it. That's enough, let him go. Didn't you hear what I said, son? - I heard you, pig. What are you gonna do, shoot me? - Let him go and I won't arrest you. - Yeah. Like I'm supposed to believe that. Damn it, shoot him! (woman screams) - Billy! - You killed my brother, pig! You're gonna pay for this! - Freeze! Freeze! Hands on top of your head. Girl in the red dress, open the door, now! Turn around and walk out! - Wake up. (somber music) No! - It could've happened to anybody. - It didn't happen to anybody. It happened to me, Spinelli. It happened to me. I can't wear this anymore. - You've got to deal with this, Billy. Where are you gonna go, man? - I don't know. (somber piano music) (catchy rock music) (dirt bike revs) (loud commotion) - Well. Here we are, Kenny. Your new school. Aren't you excited? - Yeah, Mom. Moving to a new school in the middle of my senior year. It's what every kid dreams about. - Smile. - Come on, sweetie. You're gonna love it here. Really. Oh, Ken. - Thanks. - Don't I get a kiss goodbye? - Mom. - Okay, I'll pick you up after school. - Don't worry about it, I'll walk home. She didn't even give me a thermos. - Oh, Kenny? Kenny! (loud commotion) - Check it out! (loud commotion) - Where'd you get that jacket? (loud commotion) - [Woman] Check it out. - Ah, you're the new kid, huh? - Uh, yeah. - Got a name? - [Ken] Ken. - Ken what? - [Ken] Marx. - Marx, I'm Mr. Kowalski, Vice Principal. You got a problem, you come see me. You know how to read? - Uh, yes sir. - Oh, that's refreshing. Listen, let me lay out a few campus rules for you. No smoking, no profanity, no graffiti, no fighting, no weapons, and no sex. You like sex? Ah, nevermind. On campus, keep it in your pants. Listen, you stick to these rules, I'll stay out of your face. You don't, I'll become your worst nightmare. You got it? - Yes sir. - Good, have a nice day. You, oughta look stupid, lose the cigarette. Hey, meathead. Do your parents have any kids that live? Sheesh. (loud commotion) (fireworks popping) - Gunshots, get down! (laughing) (lighthearted music) (bell rings) - Didn't you hear the bell? - Hey, it's the hall monitor. I don't care. - You guys should be in class. I'll report you to Mr. Kowalski. Let's see here, we've got Rob and-- - Well, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Not if you're gonna want to see your family alive again. - Aw. (laughs) - Alright. I'll let you guys go this time but-- - I'm a geek. - Okay. - [Principal] Your attention. Whoever put Vice Principal Kowalski's new Miata in the auditorium, we will find out who you are, and we will punish you. - Hey babe, how you doing? - Where were you last night? I called twice. - I was at the gym. - I thought we were going to the movies. - I've been gone, alright? What's the problem? - If you don't know, I really don't want to talk about it. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you walk away from me. I owe you. - God. I swear, every day you sound more and more like that jerk, Lee. - Listen. Lee's my sensei, don't talk about him that way. Get outta my way. - Hey, man. - Why are there potatoes on the board every day? Alright. Class has begun, I want gum out of the mouths now. Now who can tell me what happened in Mr. Fine's algebra class yesterday? - Some Dick freshman got his butt kicked. - Watch your mouth, Tom. - What? That's his name, Dick. (laughing) - Yeah. Sad about the quarterback's girlfriend. That was a big mistake. - Because he was sitting by a girl? - [Man] That's right. - He had to go to the hospital. - [Man] Not my problem. - He deserved it. - Yeah, well I heard he was stabbed. - (chuckles) Then I guess he got the point. - You may make light of this, but I find this behavior rather shocking. So I'll warn you right now. If I see any weapons, guns, knives, whatever, whoever they belong to... Give me that. - Excuse me. Sorry I'm late, but it's my first day at school, and I couldn't find the classroom. - Well, perhaps you should've come earlier and allowed more time to find the room then. - I tried, but my schedule-- - What's your name? - Dick. (laughing) - Ken Marx. - Alright, well, I will grant you amnesty on this one occasion, Kenneth. Do you see that desk back there? - Yes, ma'am. - Sit in it. - Yes, ma'am. - [Woman] Over here, Kenneth. - Nice thermos, Kenny. - Kenneth. (laughing) - [Teacher] Quiz in 10 minutes. Check your notes. - I see. You have a death wish. - Excuse me? - The blonde, Julie. She's beautiful. She's elegant, I mean, forget about it, she's trouble. - Why? - Because her boyfriend is Godzilla. He's a bad man. Hey. You like these? They allow me to sleep, but still look like I'm paying attention. (laughs) Pretty cool, huh? - Yeah. - My name's Mike. - I'm Ken Marx. - Welcome, Ken. Our little school here may not look like much fun, but there's a good reason for that. It isn't. (laughs) Now just sit back, relax, and try and learn something. Good night. - Hey, off that skateboard. You see what happens? Now get out of here! (banging) - First day with a new locker. - I don't suppose you can open this thing? - Oh yeah. It's probably the five prong modulator, it gets stuck with the mini. Just a little torque, and this baby... (bangs) So, Ken. What brings you to this armpit of the universe? - Well. Mom lost her job, and we had to move where the work was and-- - Wow, in your senior year too. - Yeah, what are you gonna do? I mean, it's just me and her. - What about your friends? - I guess I'll just have to make new ones. Whoa! Whoa! Ugh. Ugh, man. - Did you enjoy it? - [Woman] Yes. - That's good. - This really isn't such a bad place once you get the hang of it. Certain people you've gotta avoid, and others, you don't wanna be seen with. Like Mr. Johnson. He's a struggling actor, he played Bozo the Clown once. Now over there, we have Stinky Broom. He never changes his clothes, don't go near him without a gas mask. He got detention for smelling so bad. - Oh, man. - Those are the skinheads. Aka Nazi Warriors. Don't look. Now over here, you've got Biff and Pal. Our local football heroes. They like male bonding, you know. - You know what I don't understand though, where I'm from, we weren't all broken up like this. I mean, everybody was friends. - Well, this isn't back home, alright? Now just stick with me, and you'll be fine. Oh. No, no, no. Not her. What did I say about her? - Look, I was just gonna go say hi to her. - Her boyfriend will rip your face off. Just like that. - Come on, man. What could happen? - It's been nice knowing you, Ken. - Hi. Hi, I'm Ken Marx, the new student. I just thought I'd come and say hi. - Hi, I'm Julie. - It's nice to meet you, Julie. Is this seat taken? - Uh... (ominous music) - What the hell is this punk doing? - Looks like he's talking to your girlfriend. - Gina, handle Mr. Johnson, make sure he doesn't see this. Go. Who does this guy think he is? - I don't know, buddy. Put yourself in control. - Hi, Mr. Johnson. I was thinking about your lecture last week, secondary sexual characteristics, and I was wondering-- - Look, Ken, don't take this the wrong way. But you probably shouldn't be talking to me. I kind of have this boyfriend. - I heard about him. But that shouldn't stop me from trying to make new friends, should it? - Actually, it shouldn't, but... - Let's do it. - Oh my God. Ken, leave right now. - Why, what's going on? - It's my boyfriend, he's here. - Come on, it can't be that-- - Ken, run. - You're kidding me. - Run! - What do you think you're doing? - Why don't you watch where you're going, pal. - Be right with you, be right with you. What's up, do you want to fight with me? - I was just trying to say hi to her, is there anything wrong with that? - Ah. Talking to her is messing with me. - I wasn't trying to-- - Tom, Tom. Leave him alone. Please? - I wasn't doing anything, babe. This guy started with me. - Hey. He didn't know about you. He's new here. - You just got lucky for now. Next time. Get out of here. - Get outta here! (ominous music) (bell rings) (catchy rock music) - Hey, I've been looking for you. You see that sign up there? Is that your work? Take a look. Alright, let's see what you've got in the bag. - Big smile, say cheese. - Yeah. I thought so. Paint, yeah, you're the guy. Come on, I want you to come to the office with me. - Hey, Ken. - Hey, man. - You know, if it weren't for gravity, that would be much easier. Where you been all day? - Hiding. The guy's a madman. - I hate to say I told you so, but-- - Yeah, well, I didn't understand, okay? Great. So what am I supposed to do now? - Well, there's a train leaving for New York in about a half an hour, if you're a fast runner. - Yeah, thanks, man. - Well, listen. I just remembered I left my cat in the microwave. I gotta go, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Alright. If I make it that far. - Hi there, Kenneth. Now. I realize we just met, but I gotta tell you, I don't like you. I don't know, maybe it's your clothes, or the stupid haircut. I can't quite put my finger on it. And let me tell you something, Kenny. You stay away from Julie, got it? Okay? Got it? - Yeah, got it. - Because if you don't, bad things could happen to you. Like this. Check his wallet. (coughing) - Don't even think about it, pal. - Lifesavers. 10 bucks. (coughs) It's not about money, Kenny. It's about respect. Let's get out of here. Lee will be pissed if I'm late. - [Henchman] Bye, Kenny. (coughs) - Hey, kid. You need a hand? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Let's get you cleaned up. (coughs) (somber music) Kinda tough being a new kid, isn't it? - [Ken] Yeah, I never expected it to be this hard, though. - [Billy] You must not be from around here. - No, I'm from Salinas. It's in Kansas. What's so funny? - You're not in Kansas anymore, are you? - You know... Thanks. The thing is, everyone around here thinks I'm from some hick place with a bunch of cows and no plumbing. It's not like that at all. I mean, it's just like this place, but smaller. - Sounds nice. You have a lot of friends back there? - Yeah. I mean, heck, there were only 50 kids in my whole class at school. - Only 50? - Yeah. - How's does it feel? - It's okay. - So why'd you move here, your dad get a new job? - My mom's looking. My dad died a couple of years ago. - Sorry to hear that. - It's okay. Anyhow, a lot of people are out of work. My mom thought she could find a job here. So here I am. - Hey, you'll do fine here, kid. You got a lot of guts. And that's all you need. - Thanks. My name's Ken. - Nice to meet you, I'm Billy. Hey, I know you got better things to do than hang out with a janitor. Get outta here. Go head. - Thanks. - You are the master of your opponent. Kindness and mercy. These have no place inside this ring. I want to see you fighting in here. Not just kicking and punching your opponent, but destroying him. Crushing him, controlling him. Success is control. Control is success. You! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - Again! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - Pitiful. Again! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - Success is control! Control is success! Again! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - You! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - You! - [Group] Success is control! Control is success! - As you know, we are conducting trials for our fights today. I seek the next challenger. The one who will take on Tom in the ring tonight. I will judge their performance myself. (ominous music) I call on our party friend. Clear! (tense music) - Come with me, hotshot. - Go for a bow! (tense music) (yells) (groans) (tense music) I won. Who won? - [Group] Sensei! - [Lee] Who won? - [Group] Sensei! - [Lee] Who won? - I heard that you were picking on someone at school today. - Nah, I wouldn't do that. - Tom. Shut up. You fight for me, Tom. And you don't fight unless I tell you to. - I bet Lee used to beat people up when he was younger. - Yes. Yes, he did. But now he saves it for students who don't do as they're told. Now get your ass in gear. Because you've got a fight tonight. Get out of here. - [Mom] Hi, honey. - Hey, Mom. How was work? - Mm, not bad. My feet are killing me. - I tell you, I have got to get a job where I don't stand up all night. - You know, there might be a position open at the school. I can check for you? - You sure you don't want a ride to school? - No, I'll be fine. You get some rest. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Uh oh, Stinky Broom alert. - Gross! Take a bath! Ew! (bell rings) - Oh, is that him? - [Man] Hey, Ken. - Hey, man. - Ken? Hi. - Hey. Look, I'm really sorry about what happened. - Don't worry about it, it's not your fault. - God, you must really hate me. - No. No, I don't. I mean, you tried to warn me, I just didn't understand. - Good, that makes me feel better. (chuckles) You know, everyone's so scared of Tom that it's been a long time since any guy has just come up and said hi to me. - Oh, I can understand why. - It's so annoying. I just never realized how much before. - You know, maybe you should talk to Tom about that. - Gentlemen. - Hey. Heard you won your fight last night. - Of course. Big crowd, too. - How much did you win? - Some serious cash, brother. - Whoa. - Hundreds? - [Kid] Yeah, alright, I'll be right there. - [Teacher] Angela, if you wear that again, I will send you home. - Son of a bitch. He just doesn't understand, does he? - Tom, remember what Kate said. - Kate was talking about business. This is pleasure. - Listen to me, we've got plenty of time for this guy. - [Teacher] And no gum! - Tom, not in the classroom, okay? - Okay. (bell rings) (loud commotion) (whimsical music) - Okay. No sign of Tom in the library sector, everything looks copasetic. It's a good LZ. Sector seven's clear. We're there, man. - Hey, would you can the military stuff? Everything's gonna be fine, alright? - Uh oh. Temptation, 12 o'clock. (chuckles) Hey, no interaction. Do you want another surprise attack or something? - Look, all I did to wave to her. He can't get pissed off about that, can he? - Mr. Johnson. - Hey, what's going on? - Nothing, what's going on? - I wouldn't be too sure about that. - Oh, no. He can't be here too, man. - Alright, let's cut him off. - Evasive action now. Run! - No! (suspenseful music) - Hey! Hey, you, slow down! Hey! Hey. - Where'd he go? - He's this way. - Come on. Get out of the way! (suspenseful music) (tense music) (laughs) Where you going, Kenny boy? Nowhere to run. Did I not make myself perfectly clear yesterday when I politely asked you to stay away from Julie? - I didn't do anything, I just waved to her. - You're messing with my woman, and I'm not gonna stand for it. - You never learn your lesson, do you pal? - Guys. Get your shoes off my floor. - Excuse me. - Get your shoes off my floor. - We're busy in here, buzz off! - And leave the boy alone. - Why don't you go clean a toilet, okay? - Hey, leave the kid alone. - Say your prayers! - You guys are making a big mistake. - Go back to your room. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Stop! Billy, don't. Billy, wait! (coughs) - What's going on? - Oh my God. You kicked their butts. - No, I didn't do it. - Well, then who did? - What are you looking at! - This is amazing, Ken. - Way to go, Ken. - You're a hero. - Good job. - Look, for the last time, I didn't do it. The janitor did, okay? - I didn't see any janitor, all I saw was you. - Look, we're gonna find that janitor, and we're gonna settle this right now. - Hey, nice fight, Tom. - Get outta here! - What the hell is this? Don't these people know who's in charge here? - You know, Tom, there might be a new sheriff in town. - I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch, let's go. - Not right now, Tom. We gotta go to the dojo, okay? - Yeah, well. Tomorrow. He's toast, you hear me? - Tomorrow. - You got that! Ken Marx is dead. Ken Marx is dead! - [Ken] Hey, Billy. - Hey Ken, how you doing? - Look. I wanted to thank you for what you did for me today. I don't know why you did it, but thanks. - Hey, let's just say I saw a man who needed a hand, and I was glad to help him out. - You really did do it? Whoa! Kung fu janitor. That's so subversive, I mean that's-- - Look, Billy. I really appreciate what you did for me, but the thing is, it's not gonna make those guys any nicer to me, in fact, it's probably gonna make things worse. And I was hoping that maybe you could help me-- - Hey. I can't get more involved. - I understand. - Come on, let's go. - Hey, Ken. Everything will be alright. - Yeah, sure. (somber music) - James. Hi, yeah. I've set everything up for tonight, so you're on. - [James] Great. The usual deal? - Yeah. - [James] Word is you've got someone tough for me tonight. - That's right. - [James] It's about time. - What's your problem, Tom? - Let's go! Come on, man. - James, look. I gotta go. (phone rings) Tom! Tom! - What? - Take off your head gear! How did you get so banged up? - I fell off my bike. - He wants to see you, hotshot. Now! (ominous music) Looks like someone beat the crap out of him. - The janitor at my school, Sensei. He's a lunatic. I was just chasing this kid, you see, and for no reason, he jumps me from... - What have I told you about weakness? It's disgraceful. And when you disgrace yourself, you disgrace me. You do not have control, you have brought shame upon yourself and my dojo. Humiliation. The pain I give your outside should be nothing compared to the pain you feel inside. We are winners at my dojo. We do not let others control us, ever. If you fail again, you will be lucky if I decide to let you live. (ominous music) You know where the door is. Leave through it. - Whoever beat him up must be one hell of a fighter. Why don't I just go check out Tom's story and see about this janitor? Yeah. (bell rings) - [Teacher] For those of you who do not have plans-- - Look. Two days here, and-- - You hear that? - You're the man. I mean, personally, I think you should milk this for all it's worth. - Yeah, and why is that? - Because when Tom finds out you're taking credit for beating him up, he's gonna rip you to shreds and mail you home in a shoebox. - Two days ago, nobody wanted to talk to me. Now everybody here wants to be my friend. Why? Because they think I drew blood? - Drawing blood is a very impressive talent. I mean, not everybody can do it. - Hey. Look, I'm sorry about after school yesterday. - It's okay. My problem's not with you, it's with Tom. - Yeah. But you stood up to him. - That's not exactly true. Look, Julie. You are a really nice person, but I just can't talk to you anymore. It hurts too much. - Wait a second. How could you say that? I thought you wanted to be friends. - I do, I did! Look. I just can't, okay? I'm really sorry, I can't. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (bell rings) - Alright, class. Takes your seats, and shut up. This is very funny, thank you very much. Alright, where is it? (laughing) Who took my desk? That's not funny, I want to know who took this desk! You are all gonna spend the next semester in detention if I don't find out... I want names, alright? Who took my desk? Get rid of the knife! (loud commotion) - What's going on here? What do you think this is, your living room? Come on, pick this stuff up. Come on. Move it, cholo. - Hey, Ken! - [Kid] Oh, great catch, man. - Where were you? - I ate at the library. - What? Wait a minute, don't tell me you're one of those people who actually studies. - Look, I was worried. About being mailed home to my mother in a box. - Oh, that? I was only joking about that. I mean, Tom would never, ever, ever-- - You know something about-- - Would ever do what? - The guy with glasses? - Jesus! - Ken! I hear you've been telling people you beat me up yesterday. - Tom, I didn't say that. Everybody's-- - Ah. I don't like people telling stories about me, needle dick. When they do, they pay the price. - Tom, this is insane-- - Ah. - Oh, poor thing. (loud commotion) - Come on, boy! (groaning) Pick him up! - [Man] Stay down, man, stay down! - You like that there, Kenny? Oh, you like that? Huh? Come on, son, come on. You're doing a good job there, buddy, you're doing a good job. Only I'm the king of this school, you got that? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You understand me? This is fun, isn't it, Kenny? Isn't it fun? This is your hero? He's nothing! This is your hero? You ain't replacing nobody, Kenny boy. You got that? - [Man] Come on, that's enough man. - Anybody else want a piece of me? Huh? Come on, anybody else? (groaning) You're pathetic. Let's go. (chuckles) (somber music) - Alright, you're alright. Come on. Come on, get out of the way. - [Ken] Billy. - Oh my God. What happened to you? Have a seat. - They came after me again, just like I said they would. I told my mom this was a stupid idea! I didn't wanna move, I didn't wanna leave! - Calm down, just relax, relax. - What am I supposed to do now? Go into hiding? Move to another school? - No! You gotta learn how to protect yourself. And I'm gonna teach you. - You are? - Yeah. Because they're not gonna stop picking on you until you start standing up for yourself. Right? - Right. (intense music) This is self defense? - Screw self defense. This is called getting in shape. Don't let me stop you. Get those elbows moving. Okay. This is the last one. I want you to do an extra good job. - I get it. When this is all over, I'm gonna know how to do all kinds of karate blocks, right? It's like a wax on, wax off, paint a fence, sand the floor. - No. This is called toilet cleaning. It teaches humility. Then I want you to start over here on those urinals. Okay? - Yeah, okay. - [Billy] See ya. (lighthearted music) - Hey, what is this, your living room? There's no smoking on campus, you know that. Hey, what are you guys doing? Making an X-rated movie? Come on, let's see some daylight in there. One more time, it's detention. Paco, lose the hat. You look like a pimp. - What is this, Julie? You're avoiding me? Me? - You know, I can't believe you, Tom. What you did to Ken is terrible. - He broke the rules, so he pays the price. - He said hi to me. - You're mine, Julie. If I don't want people talking to you, they don't. - You never used to be like this. - So I learned a few tricks from Lee. Doesn't make me a bad guy. - Yeah, well, then maybe you'll have to choose between him and me. - I don't have time for this right now. We'll talk about this later, alright? - Okay. - What the hell are you looking at, Marx. Want your butt kicked again? - Good afternoon. - Hi! - I'm Vice Principal Kowalski. How can I help you? - I'm interviewing for the substitute teacher position. Sex education? - Really? Well. I hope we'll be working together. Right this way. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - Come on, Ken. Go, come on, come on. Good job. Good job, that was good, but you gotta do another one. You know you gotta give me another one, right? Come on, yeah. I want another one. Come on, let's go. Push it, push it, come on. Push it, yes, yes. (shutter snaps) (loud crash) - Lee! Lee! What the hell are you doing? You could've hurt me. - I need to know more about this man. I want you to learn more now! - Listen to me! - Now! Alright. (ominous music) - You know, Ken. You're in pretty good shape. But I want to test your reflexes. - How you gonna do that? What the hell are you doing, man? - If you can get out of the way of these, you can get out of the way of anybody's attack. - Yeah, but if you hit me with one of those, that's gonna hurt. - Oh!

And you're making a lot of progress, so just keep your spirit, okay? - I guess I'm just distracted. I've got this problem and I don't know what to do about it. - What is it? - It's a girl. - Oh, that kind of a problem. - She's the girlfriend of the guy that kicked my butt last month. - Really? - Yeah. And I like her. I mean, I've liked her from the start. Well then, Tom started pushing me around, told me I couldn't talk to her anymore. - Aren't you asking for trouble? - Well, the thing is, Tom's gonna beat me up whether I ask Julie out or not, so, might as well get beat up for a reason. - Alright. Come on. First of all, we gotta get her talking to you again. - Okay. (melancholic music) Hey. - Hey. Does this mean you think it's safe to talk to me again? - Probably not, but I'm doing it anyhow. Look, Julie, I'm sorry about that. I really want to be your friend, but Tom is just always-- - I guess I can't blame you. - Oh, hey. This is for you. It's kind of a new friendship offering. - Thanks, Ken. That's really sweet of you. (lighthearted music) - Hey Julie, you know, I was wondering if maybe you and I could get together or something? Like, after school, or Friday night? - Ken, are you asking me out? - Well, not on a date necessarily, just as friends, just for fun, maybe ice cream or something? - I'm sorry, Ken. I would really love to. But I can't. - I understand. You have a boyfriend and everything. - Look, Ken. You're a really nice guy. It's just that I've been dating Tom for a long time. And I just think he's a little confused right now. He kind of got involved with some-- - Look, pardon me, I'm not sympathetic where Tom is concerned, okay? - No, I don't expect you to be. It's... Sometimes I think about calling it off. But it's like I feel trapped. Kind of like I have to stay with him for now. - But you don't have to if you don't want to. - No, I do. Look, I can't explain it right now. I'll see you in class. - You asking Julie out? - I was trying to. - And you asked Billy instead of me? What is he, the janitor of love? Ken, I know women. I'm suave. - Oh, is that so? - I could've taught you plenty of things, buddy. - Like what? - Watch this. - Babe, how you doing? - Jerk. - Alright, bad example. Let's find another girl with tits. - Yeah, real suave, buddy. - What? - Here you go, bud. - Aw man, thanks. Man, why do we work out in there? It's 100 degrees. - Heat is pressure. You do better under pressure. Heat increases your stamina, your drive, and your endurance. - Yeah, man. And your need for deodorant. - Yeah. Hey, there's a couple cans of soda over there in the pail. - Thanks. (Ken whistles) - Hey, punk. Long time no see. - What do you want, Tom? - I hear you've been learning to fight. - That's not true, I've just been working at-- - Ah. What did you think you could do, start a revolution? Unseat me? - Tom, I don't want to fight you. - Well, that's just too bad. Cause you're going to. (suspenseful music) Round two, punk. (groaning) - Kid, I got a proposition for you. - Please, let's just get out of here. - Get in. - Thanks a lot. - No problem. What's your name? - Ken. - Ken. Relax. I don't bite. Not unless you want me to. I saw you fighting Tom out there. You're pretty good. - I'm just learning how to defend myself. - Hey, come on, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. You should be proud you know how to fight. I know a lot of kids your age who are making a lot of money at it. - But I can't fight. - Why don't you take a ride with me and see what I'm talking about, and maybe, maybe you'll change your mind. Trust me. (audience cheers) - You'll take Lee, okay. Okay. (loud commotion) - I realize that looks brutal. But believe me, each one of those guys wants to be in that ring. The winner will make a 5% cut of the fight's profit, and the loser will make about 2%. - It doesn't seem worth it. - That's about $500 for one night, Ken. And that beats the hell out of mowing lawns. Hey, plenty of those kids pave their way through college like this. - Yeah. If they don't waste it all on plastic surgery first. (crowd cheers) - Ken. Look, I want you to take this as an advance. Go out and buy some nice girl an expensive dinner. See what it's like to have some money. And then I want you to get back to me. - Look, sorry. I can't take this. (crowd cheers) (man yells) - [Announcer] Alright, that's the fight, folks. - Come on, you just cost me $20. I hope you enjoyed the ride, here you go. Get him up. - [Announcer] A decisive victory over Joltin' Jeff Swade. Windows is still open for the big event, so hurry, hurry, hurry, place those bets. And next, the event you've all been waiting for, our final bout of the evening, entering the ring now with six wins, and three TKOs, direct from the Big Apple, our challenger, Deadly David Stern. And now, here he is, the king of the coliseum, our sensational sensei, undefeated after 31 fights, seeking to continue his reign of pain, our returning champion, Lee! (crowd chants) Attention please, the windows are now closed. All bets are final. - Gentlemen, face me. Bow. Face each other. Bow. Bow. Fighting stance. Fight! (loud commotion) (intense music) (crowd cheers) (intense music) - Yeah! This is it right here! Go! (crowd cheers) - [Announcer] Alright, there you have it, folks. Our very own Lee, with a fast and furious victory. (crowd chants) - Ah, another loser. (crowd boos) - Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't know, okay? - Damn! You try to one little bit of good for this world, and it all turns to garbage. Kids fighting for money? - But some of them could use it. She said a lot of them could use it to pay their way through college. - If they need money, there's better ways for them to get it than that. I'm sick of crap like this! - What are you, Mr. Know-It-All janitor? Billy, I'm sorry about that. Billy. I knew you always weren't a janitor. And I want you to tell the truth. - Ken, I used to be a cop. Then I killed a kid. It was a mistake. - Did you have to quit? - No, I couldn't handle it anymore. But I'm thinking about getting back into it. - You want to bust the guys that are running the fights? - They're hurting kids to make money, and that's not right. These people are dangerous. If you refuse to fight for them, it could be real trouble for you. - Well, we'll just keep training, right? - Yeah, go warm up. - You coming? - Yeah, I'll be there in a bit. - Alright. (loud slamming) - Mhm. See anything you like, Kate? - Yeah, high school boys are such a turn on. - Hey now. That was good, right? (laughs) - Yeah, yeah you were. You lasted what, three minutes? What a thrill. By the way, I dropped by your high school, I checked out that kid that's giving you so much trouble. - Who? - Who is that, ah see, I think his name is Ken? Quite the good little fighter, isn't he? - Nah. He's nothing. - [Kate] He was good enough to put you on your ass. - That little bastard. He thinks he can fight me, I'm gonna kill him. - You won't do anything unless I tell you to. - I don't have to listen to you. - Hey. I'm interested in him, Tom. So keep your hands off of him. And by the way, if I hear that you disobeyed me, and I will hear of it, Tom, then I'll make sure that you never fight again. (loud bang) (hopeful intense music) (phone rings) - [Spinelli] Detective Spinelli speaking. - Hey, Spinelli. - [Spinelli] Is this who I think it is? - Yeah, it's your old partner. - [Spinelli] I thought you fell off the Earth. - Yeah, it has been a long time. Hey. I have something I need your help with. - It's just a warehouse. There's nothing illegal going on here. - There is, I've been watching this place. - Now look, Billy, I am worried about you. You withdraw from society, disappear for years, and then you call me out of the blue, wanting to stop some illegal fighting ring that nobody knows about. - People know about this place, Spinelli. - Let's talk to this guy over here. - Talk to him? Wait, you can't! Wait! - Hold up, buddy. I'd like to ask you a question. - You ain't seen nothing. (groaning) (intense music) - It's gonna hit you like a mule! - Hey! - Spinelli, we got four more coming, let's go! (loud commotion) - Go on, go, go, go, go, just go. (tires screech) - Stop, rewind. There. Is this the man you took pictures of before? - Yeah. - Kill him. In the school. Make sure everyone sees his body. - My pleasure. - [Teacher] In honor of St. Patrick's Day, the cafeteria will be serving green meat loaf and mash potatoes for lunch today. - Hey Kenny, what's going on? - Hey. Nothing, I'm just getting ready to do a little work, you know? - With that big black eye again? - What's this, you've been spying on me? - Oh yeah, every day. You know, I thought you were on the track team or something. But you're not, you're working out with the janitor. (chuckles) - Look. I'll tell you why I work out everyday, if you'll go out with me tonight. - Ken, you know I can't. - Why, because of Tom? - Come on, you don't even like him anymore. - Yes, I do. - No, look, you're just too afraid to break up with him. - Look, he's my boyfriend, alright? If you can't handle that, maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore. - God. - That was smooth. - Oh, shut up. - What? (catchy guitar music) - Go, go, go, go, go! Police! Clear. - Anybody? Not like that. - Okay, we're here. All the way back here. - Damn. Let's go. - I really like her, Billy. I mean, I think about her all the time. - Have you told her that? - Yes, and no. I mean, I tried to ask her out, it didn't work. - That's not the same thing. How does she feel about you? - I don't know. I mean, she talks to me all the time, more than Tom. Maybe she does like me. - If she didn't like you, she wouldn't talk to you. - You think so? - Hey, you're probably one hell of a catch. - Really? - Yeah. Look at your competition. - Tell me about it. (chuckles) - What? You guys are so insensitive sometimes. (laughing) (popcorn pops) - I'm gonna get a soda, you want one? - Uh, listen Tom, do we have to see this movie? Can we go somewhere else? - Like where, I already bought the tickets. - Like some place where we can be alone for a little while. - Mm, spend a little time in the backseat, hm? - No, Tom. I want to go some place where we can talk. - Talk? What's there to talk about? We talk all the time. - No we don't, Tom. You haven't talked to me for weeks. And when I do see you, all you want to do is party or get into my pants. Well I'm sick of it. - What do you think you're doing? You never used to act like this. It's Ken, isn't it? I'm sick and tired of the two of you hanging out all the time. - Let go of me. - I don't want you to ever talk to him again. In fact, if I catch you hanging around him, I'm gonna beat the-- - You can't control my life. - Listen, you are my girl, and you'll do exactly what I say. - That's it, Tom. We're through. - No we're not. Julie, get back here, Julie! - Tom, come on, let her go. Can we get some popcorn please? - [Mom] You alright, kiddo? You know, it's not healthy to be home on a Friday night. - I'm fine, Mom. Just hanging out. How was the interview? - I don't know, Kenny. I'm not finding jobs I thought I would, and well, waitressing, it's okay, it's money, but I don't know. If I don't find something soon, we might have to move again. - Don't worry about it, Mom, we're gonna be alright. I know we will. - You are such a great kid. Listen. Why don't you go out, have some fun with your friends tonight. Okay? - Okay. (phone rings) Hello. - Hi, Ken? It's Julie. Do you think you could come pick me up? I'm right across the street from Cinema Six. Please hurry. Thanks. (ominous music) (loud clanging) - Lee sends his regards. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Ta-da! - Wow, you're quite the outdoorsman. - Well, it's that Midwest upbringing. - Hey, thanks a lot for picking me up tonight. I really needed it. - It's my pleasure. I mean, I had big plans tonight, but it was no problem breaking them. - You know, you have been so nice to me. And I don't think I've been very nice to you. - No, you have. You talked to me when a lot of other people wouldn't. - And my boyfriend beat you up because of it. Look, I know what you're doing after school every day. Practicing. - How'd you know about that? - Mike told me. - Son of a... - Listen, if you're doing this because Tom is still making-- - No. I'm not doing it because of Tom. I'm doing it for myself. - Why? - So I could steal you away from him. - You already have. (ominous music) (groaning) (plates breaking) (groaning) - This time you lose, Billy. - You're wrong. (groaning) (dark music) - Good morning, Ken. Listen, I heard your mom's having a hard time finding a good job? If money's tight, my offer still stands. - Look. If you don't leave me alone, I swear I'm gonna go to the cops. (laughs) - You know, I'm a very powerful woman, Ken. I always get what I want. If I think you need to be taught a lesson, then I'll make sure that you're taught a lesson. Just like Billy. - Billy? What are you talking about? - You'll find out. (melancholic music) - Billy! Billy! Billy? Billy! (loud commotion) - Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here! Get back to class. You guys, quit hanging around, get to class. Don't you have something better to do, Marx? Get to class. - Hey, man. Have you seen Billy anywhere? - Yeah. I had breakfast at his house this morning. - Look, he's gone. I can't find him anywhere. - You mean, he vanished? Wow. Just like Hoffa. (chuckles) - Hey, hey, Jules. What's happening Friday night? You need to return my phone calls. - We are through, Tom. Understand? - What the hell's going on over there? Dude, Ken. - And if you ever touch me again, I'll have Ken kick your ass. - Ken? You went out with him, didn't you? You little slut. - Let go of me! - You stay away from him, you understand me? - Don't you ever touch her again. - Touch her? I own her, Kenny. - No, Tom. You don't own anybody. - Oh, yeah? I've been waiting a long time for this. - No, guys! Hold, hold it. Cool off, cool off! - Hey, knock it off over there! - You guys, hey! You want to settle this? Fine! But settle it like men in a real ring. - Anytime, anyplace. - Eight o'clock, Friday night, my dojo. - Fine. - Don't! For me. - No, Julie. This time it's gonna be for me. Eight o'clock it is. - You're dead, Kenny boy. Understand me? You're dead. - Eight o'clock is good for me, boys. - Shut up! (intense saxophone music) - What's your problem, man? This is sparring! - Just fight, will you? - That's it! I've had it with you, man! - Get back in here! (intense saxophone music) - Sam, it's Kate. Major fight tonight. Two young tough guys fighting it out over a woman. No, I've been watching them. They're ready to kill one another. (loud commotion) - Hey. - No sign of Billy? No. - Okay. I realize I'm not your coach, but I know you got what it takes to beat this guy, I mean, it's no question. Just go out there and keep a stiff upper lip, and stay on your toes, float like a butterfly-- - And sting like a bee? - You know the stuff. Okay. Just go out there and open a can of whoop ass on this guy. - You got it, man. Hey. Thanks for being there for me. - What are friends for? Are you scared? I'm not. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen! The big event is about to begin. Windows are open, but time's running out, the place goes fast. So if you're putting down cash, you better dash. Everyone else, please clear the ring, and get to your seats. - Piece of cake. Piece of cake. Oh my God. (crowd cheers) - Ken. Ken, listen to me. Please don't do this. Tom is crazy, he'll kill you. - Julie, I'm not gonna lose this fight. (crowd cheers) - Hi, darling. - [Announcer] Revved up, and ready to slug it out! - Out of the way, out of the way. Good to see you, yeah. This is where you oughta put your money. You know where to put your money? Right here, the kid. (crowd cheers) (chuckles) - Let's go in and handle it. (crowd cheers) - Do you really think this is a good idea? - Me? No. I think this is the worst idea I've ever heard. That's why I called the police. - You what? - Well, I mean, this is illegal, right? I figured they'd want to know, so I told them to stop by around eight o'clock. (chuckles) Or was it nine. - Face each other. Bow. Fighting stance! - It's payback time, needle dick. - Fight! (crowd boos) - Will you fight, for God's sakes? - You gonna fight, or are you gonna run? Come on, Ken. Fight, fight, fight! (crowd chants) Come on, Ken. Fight me. (crowd cheers) - Yes! (Tom coughs) (suspenseful music) - Get up! - You ain't nothing, Kenny boy. You hear me? Come on, Kenny boy. You're making this too easy. Let's go, boy. Let's go. (crowd cheers) (intense music) Come on, Ken! (groaning) Hit me, Ken. Come on! (groaning) Come on! (crowd cheers) - That's enough of this, Tom. I've had enough! (groaning) - Take that, boy. - You had enough, boy? Get up here, come on! (groaning) - Hey come on, Tom. Fight fair. (laughing) - Mike, stop the fight! Throw in the towel. - There is no towel. - Ken. Ken, this is enough. Okay? You don't have to finish this. - Kill him, my boy. Destroy him. (crowd boos) - Yeah! (hopeful music) (crowd cheers) (crowd cheers) - Come on, Ken! Kick his ass! (crowd cheers) (crowd chants) - You're failing me! (crowd chants) - Now it's your turn, needle dick. (crowd cheers) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the winner, Ken Marx! What a fight that was! Incredible! - Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! - You. - Ken! - You reek of failure! - That's enough, Lee. (suspenseful music) - Get up, man! (crowd boos) - Get him, Billy! - Get him! (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Can he do that? - Come on, man. Come on, Billy! - You want it? (groaning) - Come on! Get up! - Come on! - Come on, Billy. (crowd cheers) - Get him, kill him! (hopeful music) (crowd cheers) - Yeah, yes, go! - You're not gonna hurt anymore kids, Lee. (Lee yells) - Yeah! - Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy! (crowd chants) - Billy, Billy. Are you okay? I didn't know where you were, man. Alright. - Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy! - You did it, man. You did it. - No. We did it. - [Announcer] Uh, that concludes this evening's entertainment. Please exit in an orderly fashion. Ow! (loud commotion) - Halt. - Oh, back off, you jerk! - You're not going anywhere. Whoa. - Are you sure you're okay? - Well I guess in this case, the best man lost. What the hell. - It's okay. - Ah. See you around, man. Thank you. Bye Julie. - Oh, man. - Get him out of here. - Thank God. - Mr. Grant. We want to know if you'd consider working with us. We're not too happy with our sensei. - Sure. - Really? Let's go, guys. - Woo! Party at my house, buddies. No alcohol of course. Just fruit punch and alfalfa sprouts for you. - Hey, Billy. - Yeah. - It looks like you did quite a job here. - I just did what I had to do. - Now you listen. The department is looking for somebody to teach self defense, and you know, your name came up. Hey. Thought you might be interested. - Yeah. I think it's about time for me to get my life back together. - Well, I hope so. I hope so, my man! - Excuse me. (hopeful music) - Okay, that's enough. Let's get out of this dump. We've got some partying to do. (lighthearted music)
