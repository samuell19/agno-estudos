I'm giving you a case. You're giving me a lead for you so that you can keep on doing whatever it is you're doing. I'm picking a jury of my peers. Wouldn't that be a colorful lot. You gave us The Pharmacist so that Dembe could get five minutes alone with him. You asked for a psych eval so you'd be sent to a mental-health facility where someone you needed to see was a patient. If you're accusing me of using the Task Force to assist me in avoiding the hangman's noose, - guilty as charged. - I want to help you, but I can't if you don't tell me what it is you're doing. I'm fighting for my life. And you are helping more than you know. Why can't you just be honest with me? You remind me so much of your mother. I don't remember if I've ever told you that before, have I? There are a lot of things you haven't told me. I'm here because someone betrayed me, someone close. Under the circumstances, it's hard to know who to trust. Okay. Tell me about the case. What do you know about entomological warfare? For over 1,000 years, human beings have been weaponizing insects. In the 12th century, wasps nests were catapulted into enemy towns. During the Cold War, the Pentagon developed plans to produce 100 million yellow fever-infected mosquitoes per month. And the most notorious Japanese war criminal in World War II was General Shiro, who bred bubonic plague-carrying insects that killed tens of thousands of Chinese. Did Reddington give you a case or a history lesson? A bit of both. A year ago, a patent attorney was found suffocated in his office. Why? An infestation of deadly beetles had eaten the lining of his lungs. - Ew. - And six months ago, it was a chemical manufacturer's turn, and yesterday, the head of a bio-tech company. Eaten from the inside by killer beetles. Apparently, and according to Reddington, they were put there by a modern-day General Shiro. Am I right in assuming this case has something to do with his defense? Yes, but he wouldn't tell me why. Our immunity deal with Reddington has been invalidated. He stands accused of treason. Is this your periodic reminder that by working with him, we may be viewed as aiding and abetting? It's a possibility, especially if we pursue cases in which his agenda is, to be polite, obscure. We're all in, if that's what you're asking. Samar, ARAM, look into what connects the victims. The man who died yesterday... Bob Lockemy, founder of Lockemy Technology. Go to the M.E., see what he can tell you about the weaponized insects that killed him. SIMA: Your Honor, we agree with Mr. Reddington. Jury questionnaires can be sent to potential jurors prior to jury selection, but he wants to ask 382 questions, most of which require essay answers. It would take jurors days to complete. RED: I'm sorry if you find the process of selecting a fair jury to be inconvenient, Mr. SIMA, but you are trying to kill me for a crime I didn't commit. The problem is not inconvenience. It's relevance. Example... Question 133. I quote, "Compare and contrast the role of memory in the works of Proust and Dickens, with examples." How can I sensibly judge one's character if I don't know their views on great literature? This is absurd. In case you haven't read a newspaper recently, Mr. SIMA, all of our lives are playing out in the theater of the absurd these days. Your Honor, I believe the prosecution wants to intentionally dumb down the jury questionnaire because he wants to attract dumb jurors because Mr. SIMA wants a jury of unsophisticated, unthinking sheep who will blindly convict me of treason out of some misguided notion that it's the patriotic thing to do. I, on the other hand, want astute jurors, people who can understand the somewhat complicated evidence I plan to present, capable of evaluating not only my motives, but also those of the government. The literature question is stricken. Excellent. That sort of bias will only aid in my appeal should the government win in this round of play. We also object to question 134, "Who is your favorite classical composer?" Okay, I will not be judged by anyone who likes Schumann. I refuse to be sent to my death by Philistines. I love Schumann. "Fantasie in C Major" was played at my mother's funeral this past summer. I'm sorry for your loss. Mr. Reddington, 40 questions should be sufficient. No essays, keep it simple, and don't waste my time. RESSLER: Dr. Maguire, thanks for meeting with us. So, what do you have? It appears that your victim... suffocated. On insects? Best I could tell, some kind of water beetle. Apparently, they're scavengers and fierce predators, but what I don't understand is how the larva were able to survive in his digestive enzymes and stomach acids. I'm sorry. I thought you said he suffocated. That is the official cause of death, but I found larval remnants in his stomach wall and digestive tract, which suggests that he may have ingested them. These creatures were literally feeding on him, eating from the inside out. My guess is that they migrated into his bronchial tubes and lungs, and the incision in the neck, well, that simply provided an escape hatch. Just a guess. I'm not an expert in insects. You probably should talk to an entomologist. Know anyone you can recommend? Not personally, but I do know that Dr. Jonathan Nikkila, he worked at the same company as your victim.

Did you have a chance to look at what the M.E. sent over? I have, and it's terrifying. ♪ You are looking at a genetically modified version of a predacious diving beetle known as the Dytiscidae. - Predacious? - Predatory. There are over 4,000 types of carnivorous beetles. But none that prey on humans? Not naturally, no, but nothing about what happened to Bob was natural. The gestation period of the Dytiscidae is at least a week, and there's no reason the larvae should've survived inside his body for that long after the eggs had hatched. But that's what the medical examiner said happened. I can't explain it. All I know is that someone made alterations. Those are its jaws. By my math, they are four times normal size. Talk about weaponized. But why go to the trouble to make a super bug? I mean, there are easier ways to kill people. Well, not if you want to be ironic. He sent a bug to kill a bug killer. Lockemy Technologies made pesticides. Powerful ones. Like Hexapene, which I developed when I worked there. It was designed for use after natural disasters like hurricanes when the standing waters left behind could breed potentially disease-infected insects. Some people thought it was too powerful, so it was not approved for commercial use, but I still got death threats. For killing diseased bugs? You sound very rational, but in the environmental world, that type of thinking is in short supply. So you think someone from the environmental community targeted Lockemy? I was a lowly technician. Bob was the CEO. If I got death threats, I'm sure he did, too. We've been led to believe that our killer fashions himself as a latter-day General Shiro. Does that mean anything to you? General Shiro was a war criminal, but his knowledge of how to weaponize the insect world was so great that instead of executing him, the Allies hired him to teach us how to wage bio-war. If the man you are looking for fashions himself after Shiro, it means to get his point across, he doesn't care how many people he kills. Hexapene is what connects the three victims. Lockemy ran the company that developed it, Steiner was the attorney he hired to patent it, and Helfrich was the chemist he used to manufacture the pesticide. Nikkila told us Hexapene wasn't approved for commercial use. Not yet, but according to a recent SEC filing, Lockemy was lobbying Congress and the FDA for approval. And now someone's killed everyone involved in making that happen. I got something. This is Lockemy's calendar. Business meetings, speeches, lunches he'd scheduled, including one he had a week ago with Dick Kendel. Wait. The clean air guy? The clean air guy, the clean water guy. In the environmental community, he is the guy, and his current crusade... leading the fight to ban pesticides like Hexapene. Kendel is a lobbyist. Maybe he had lunch with Lockemy so he could lobby him to change his mind. Maybe, but he did have lunch with him a week ago. So? So Dr. Nikkila told us the gestation period for these bugs is a week. Which means a week ago, our killer found a way to get Lockemy to eat or drink their way into his system. What better way to do that than at a power lunch on K Street?

[CELLPHONE BEEPS] Written answers having been given, we will now proceed to in-person interviews. Given this is a death-penalty case, each side has 20 peremptory challenges. Does defense counsel understand the nature of such challenges? Yes, Your Honor. It means that by the time the jury is seated, there won't be a Schumann lover in the bunch. This should be fun. Treason is pissing on our flag, going against our own people. Anybody who does that deserves to die, in my opinion. I'd pull the trigger myself. We'll certainly keep you in mind for that. So, you're a professor of criminal psychology. Are you confident that you could be impartial in assessing the evidence in this case? I am. In fact, I have been before.

It's why we got laws, anyway. But you could bring back a verdict without fear or prejudice? Of course I could, yes. RED: Your Honor, I'd ask that this juror - be dismissed for cause. - Grounds? A close member of her family was victimized by crime. I think it's reasonable to question her ability to be impartial. She just said she could be fair-minded. And I'm sure she believes that. Your motion to strike for cause is denied. If you have concerns, you can use one of the few peremptory strikes you have left. - No, thank you, Your Honor. - MAN #1: It's simple. If more people were executed, maybe the death penalty would work the way it should work and criminals just might think twice. Your Honor, I'd give a dozen strikes to dismiss this juror. I put my life on the line to defend this country. Friends of mine have died for it. So, yeah, if this guy's guilty of betraying the U.S., I think capital punishment is appropriate. Respectfully, I move to strike for cause. - Because he's a veteran? - No, because it appears he already thinks I'm guilty. He said "if" you're guilty. How long have I been with the ACLU? 28 years. I'm a card-carrying member. Would you care to see the card? That won't be necessary. Your Honor, this juror is acceptable to the defense. But not the prosecution. Peremptory strike, Your Honor. - Move to strike. - Your Honor, please strike. - Strike, Your Honor. - Truth is, I detest any form of political correctness, conventional wisdom, or government intrusion. Do you believe in the rule of law? The best and the brightest should rule, not the law. Your Honor, the defense accepts and welcomes this juror. Move to strike. [GAVEL BANGS] So... you like pugs. No, I love pugs. Even with all the scratching and the wheezing, the drooling and the gassiness? That is a myth. Pugs don't suffer... I think you love them because they suffer. Perhaps because you suffer. This is jury selection, Mr. Reddington, not group therapy. Your Honor, this juror said she favors the death penalty and that her husband was a cop. With all due respect, she certainly qualifies as an obvious dismissal on my part. I'm aware of that. I'm also aware that you are out of peremptory challenges. You may strike subsequent jurors for good cause only, and loving pugs isn't cause. Ah, well, you see, but it is. It's cause for hope. Only people with a healthy dose of empathy are capable of caring for beasts with such deficits. Did you just call my pugs beasts? That's what some people see. You clearly see something else. I know what I see, and I don't like it. Give it time. I've been known to wheeze and scratch. I prefer not to discuss the drool and the flatulence. Your Honor, this juror is acceptable to the defense.

What is your feeling about the death penalty? I get pre-judged plenty. I try not to return the favor. If you were asked to impose... Guess you could say I'm not unlike that blindfolded beauty, Dame Justice, up there in her silky robe. No bias, no prejudice. I don't discriminate. Or apparently, follow simple instructions. Except against cats! I hate cats. Besides that, I'm good. I'm sorry. What was your question? Exactly. Move to dismiss the juror, Your Honor. On what grounds? That he's open-minded? That the abuse that's been heaped upon him as a result of his decidedly unpleasant personality has made him reluctant to do unto others as they have so often done unto him? This isn't a popularity contest. Mr. Sima's dismissiveness is, I'm sure, an all too familiar event in this man's life. He's odd and annoying and clearly incapable of following instruction. I think it's safe to say that even those who know him best, perhaps especially those who know him best, probably hold him in remarkably low regard. But the lamentable characteristics that make him an outcast are the very ones that make him perfectly suited to sit on this jury. Beholden to no one because no one likes him. Capable of making up his own mind because he's incapable of listening to anyone else. He is an outcast. Maybe even deservedly so, but if he's able to administer blind justice in this case, I think we should give him a chance with the blindfold. Whatever justice this juror may have been intending to administer will hardly be blind after defense counsel's stirring remarks on his behalf. JUDGE WILKINS: I'm not so sure he was damning with faint praise or praising with faint damnation. Either way, if the juror insists he's impartial, I'm inclined to take him at his word. So I made the cut? You did, Mr. Carter. Thank you in advance for your service. Thank you, Your Majesty. And may I say, uh, unlike my last judge, you are a tall drink of water. Your last judge?
