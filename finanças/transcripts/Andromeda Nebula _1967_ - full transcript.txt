To you, who live in the twentieth century. You, the elders, accept my skill and desir.. Accept my labour, and teach me day and night. Give me the hand of aid, since the way is difficult. And I will follow you. You, the elders, accept my skill and desire. Accept my labour... Good day, Mven Mas. - Are you hear for the presentation? - I am sent by the Council of Astronavigation. The entire day we look for you on whole planet, and you are here. The time of Hercules's Exploits. Mven, I am not alone, there are members of the Council. They would like to talk with you. They are there, on the helicopter area. I'll be right back. The Council requests you, Mven, to accept the post of the manager by the external stations of Great Ring. - But Dar Veter? - He is leaving. Must I answer now? Tomorrow is next reception from the Great Ring, it's good opportunity for the transfer of the matters. I am going to the observatory today, I have only finish ceremony here. Well, we know, mentor-teacher. I will be busier now, but we've all become mature. My teacher was Erg Noor. By the way, are there any news about Tantra? The program of 37th Star is finished. Al'Graab with Anameson went towards Tantra. And if an encounter took place... The field-stress is two times greater than calculated. - It will be necessary to lower speed. But how with accelerate flight? We'll lack Anameson. Make a decision, Pel. Commander will be awake in only three hours. Switch on planetary vision. What a swift increase of gravity. What is there in beyond? Just darkness. Only darkness. But, here's nothing, here there cannot be anything. This region is too little studied, Pel. Switch front screens to infrared. Stop engines. What a fool. I was convinced that we are near the dark cloud. But this... Yes, this is an iron star. Congratulations, Pel. You discovered it in place, where no-one suspected its existence. If we caught earlier. Now we can't escape its attraction. Awakening. Immediate awakening to entire crew. I still don't understand his decision. Couldn't the Council really persuade him? Is there a rule to persuade man to be that which he does not want to be? Yes, but Dar Veter led the outer stations for six years. Protection throughout the entire Earth. To all power plants, to all factories, to net transport and to radio stations. Good day, Veter. Well, all is decided? Decided. I am glad, Veter. You should rest. It is, probably, hard to understand. It is hard, until you experience similar yourself. The dear matter, the matter, by which you lived... which is given by society... this matter suddenly becomes for you not so important. Not only... Veter, do you have time? Are you free now? I will come to you. Wait. You are too hard on yourself. - Hard? But if you can increase your voice, ignore the observation of comrades, then you begin to believe only in yourself. At whatever the post you will find this illness, and it is necessary to change the occupation. Doctors say that? I say it myself, doctors only confirm. Stop it, Veter. Tantra has not returned yet. But I love you. You forgot, Veter. There is Erg Noor. Do you still love him? No, I do not love. Then you are free. What holds you back? What? I am convinced, convinced that each of you... will worthily meet tests, fallen on our path. As an astronaut. As an earthling. I was able to deflect spaceship, and we will not fall down to the iron star. But it will be impossible for us to escape from its attraction. Encounter with Al'Graab did not take place, and Anameson was spent to the braking entirely. We are captured by this star. I do not ask your for advice, I already made a decision. This star has two planets. We will become satellite of one of them, prepare a signal, send it to the Earth and await aid. And it will be long wait. At least how long, approximately? Twenty, twenty five years... Not too many. When we return, I will be only fifty. And I, seventy-five. Crew, take you places. We pass into orbital flight. You are in space for the first time. - twenty years, is this terrible for you? - And for you? - I was born in space, on-board a spaceship. - I didn't know. And my first childish impressions were - blackness of space, the myriads of stars and the panels of the ship. But you did not answer me. Twenty years, this is surely terrible. - But I am glad. In any case, these twenty years next to you will be me. But not she. Good day. Am I not late? I have heard a lot about you. And I, you. After the gathering of information from epsilon of Toucan, she'ill read a lecture concerning our history for the planet of the system of star Canopus. It's time. - Begin preventive. - Agree. - Begin counting. - Begin battery stations. Satellite 57 greets you, earthlings. The Earth greets satellite. Kour Ghan, this is Mven Mas. Pay attention to him. - From now you will work with him. - Here everything is ready, waiting for epsilon of Toucan. Apparently, they are attempting to make the contact with any civilization. Well, Kour Ghan, give direct connection. Attention. It's time, Mven, to take the resources of the planet into your hands. We go forward. Mountains. Just like the Pamir. - Height not more than 2000-3000 meters. Imagine, the colour of the water. - Outlines... - What is this? Large meteorite. -Or... - Ship? - Spaceship. Rocket. Rocket? Fantasy. Here, in the basic routes, in the rear of the galaxy? I think, they do not have planets with the highest forms of life. They are lonely. Yes, they are lonely, as lonely as we earthlings. Until we deciphered the language of Great Ring and entered to the general brotherhood of reason. Do they really know nothing about the Great Ring? Probably now they already know. What we see now, occurred 300 years ago. 300 years. 88 parsec. All, who we see now, are already dead long ago. 88 parsec. 88... That's all. His position is unstable, but it is fixed and now it is gathered. Make sure that today entire planet would know about this. And prepare information for the members of Ring. - I am disconnecting, Veter. - Ask him, he is the chief now. How long will the lecture go to Canopus? 100 - 120 years. And they will see me living. What a monstrous contradiction between the might of man, his reason, and his nonentity before the time and the space. And humanity is thus far not able to overcome and to compress time. You have 10 minutes more. Will you remain here or you come with me? I'll stay here. She is excellent. And amazingly terrestrial. She is amazing. For the first time in 800 years of existence of Great Ring we saw a planet with the brothers not only on the reason, but also throughout the body. I have my reasons why I do not love space, with its emptiness and monstrous distances. They are now there, and if something happens, either me or entire humanity have no forces to help. - Excuse me, commander. - Something happened? The second turn begins. Yes, I know. She is beautiful. Beautiful. But she does not love you. I saw, how she accompanied you. As a friend, as a person, who ventures, but not as a loved one. This portrait, it supports you in hard times, it strengthens faith, gives power, but it does not call back to the Earth. Correct? Central station speaking. Commander, this is spaceship. We had time to take a picture. Alien. You do understand? Alien. What happened, Mven? Why this urgency? Did you hear about my new work? Not only heard, but also saw in the last news the solemn deed of conveyance of the matters. Ren, here is why I called you here. See. There is the star epsilon of Toucan, and there the star 61 Cygnus, and further is Albireo. Three stars. And there, and there, and there is life. I know, Ren, I saw. There pulses thought, brothers on the reason live there. But they are monstrously far apart. Ren, I know. In your academy you deal with space. With space as a function of the time. Let's connect our endeavours, Ren. I want to shrink time. And then to see the living and to speak with the living. You are theorist, Ren. Is this possible? It seems, that I am close to the solution. But my conclusions need checking. And checking is experiment. I am glad that you understood me. You and me are just grit in this boundless space. But today, right now, we issue a challenge. The spaceship does not react to our signals. Sixteenth turn. The noise of planetary engines one cannot fail to hear. Disc spaceships are unknown in the regions adjacent with us. I am convinced that this alien is in trouble. What does the crew propose? We are in trouble, too. But they clearly need aid. As if we do not need aid. Eighteenth turn. They do not hear us. Or do not understand. We have to land, commander. - That's the last of the fuel. - Yes, the last. No longer we will be able to take off. And we will not be able to send signal flare? We will not be able to send the rocket. We are evaluating. We are in doubt. There, below, are the messengers from another world. Crew, remain in your places. We go to the lower layers of the atmosphere for the landing. Switch on the warning signals. The station of work assignment. Good morning. The place in the underwater titanium mines on the coast of South America is free. But it is necessary to arrive urgently. Excuse me, I forgot to inform you, I already selected a place. I am just gathering the stuff. I am going to the archaeological expedition. No problem. I just wanted to carry out your request more precisely. We will find enough people to this place. The station of the distribution of accommodations, good morning. I am leaving. Sector 6, 385 691. Accepted. Finally. I started thinking, that I arrived too early. Well, Veter, everything is already behind. - Now you are my subordinated. - I obey. It is dead. And long ago. Another victim of the space. As I understand, catastrophes are inevitable, but to see it... Eon, cross-country vehicle is ready. Cross-country vehicle is ready. Excellent, Kay, we go. Emergency group to the vehicle. Elder aboard the ship is Kay Bear. - Pel. What about your planet? - Why my? But whose is it? Who did discover the iron star? Planet like a planet. It is possible to live. It also could not take off. As well as we. It broke within the limits of the iron star's attraction. It's a trap-planet. There are warnings on the Great Ring about them. The legends are filled with them. How many millennia was it? Why? What was lacking, in his home? The same what we lack, Kim, knowledge, brotherhood. - Commander, I will go around it to the left. - And I to the right. May be we are to careless, Erg? Strange planet, strange life. Eon, Niza, stop. Back. Pel, here. Back. Hold them in the light. Back. Eon, Niza. Do not go from the light. All move away behind the vehicle. Hold to the light. - What about Kim? - Why are you silent? What's with Kim? Erg, answer. I have heard these call signs on many planets. The best children of the Earth remained here to warn those who are going by track. Our boy. Erg, you do not know. He imitated you in everything, he trained his will so ridiculously. Only I answer for all that happened. But there is sense to speak about only on the Earth. On The Earth? Commander, do you still believe in the possibility? I believe thus far I live. We will gather signal flares. But fuel? Let us attempt to enter into the strange spaceship. It is possible, there is some form of energy. You forget, commander, out of the ship we are powerless, unarmed for this. Light. Commander was the first to understand this. The killer is the creature of gloom, and he must fear light. Back. All move away behind vehicle. Lower filters. Carefully. Protect your eyes. What's there, Kay? We go forward. - But you will leave the light of Tantra - We go. - Terrestrial vehicle from the terrestrial spaceship. - What vehicle? What spaceship? I cannot accompany you by light. Erg, where are you? We go forward. Tantra.We found terrestrial vehicle. There are no people. Kay, we go forward. Raise searchlights. Try to accompany us. In the last ten years no one ship of first class has left the Earth. Yes, but 15 years ago started 36th Starry. - And one ship did not return. - Do you think, this is Sail? This is Sail. Terrestrial spaceship of the first class. Gemini of our Tantra. Do you no longer like our work? I am complacent, I am calm, as if they treat me by blue dreams. Yes, of course. After so many years of contact with space... our work seems small and dull. In my opinion, in the past centuries they already dug over everywhere, entire planet. It was always so. Some look to the future, others are investigating in the past. The same will be after us, Veter. I just talked with Mven Mas. The stated time passed, but "Tantra" is still silent. Something happened, Veter. We know space so little. Actually, we are trampling down on the small scrap of space. Kay, Lin. Be especially attentive. Hold us always in the light. Somewhere there must be the terminal of emergency light. That's odd. It works. Enter. The fourth. - Ingrid, Kay, do you copy us? - Yes, we do, commander. - All is fine, Erg. - We go inside. Eon will inspect forward holds, Niza and me the central station. Pel and Lin inspect stern accommodations. Pel, anameson is most important. Niza, look for flight diary first. Commander. Erg. Do you read me? Very well, Eon. That means, that on-board radio equipment is working. Attention. Central station speaking. - Pel, do you read me? - I do, commander. Dust. Soot. Nothing suspicious. Nothing super-natural. Only two accumulations of incomprehensible origin, on the floor and on the wall. Here the same. In the corridor there is a strange spot near the chamber 016. Just on the door, in human size. - Did you enter the chamber? Why do you keep silent? Perhaps I did not say? There is anameson. Four containers. Four. Tantra. Friends. Do you hear? My dear friends, we are saved. Perhaps someone will finally turn off this damned signal? Flight diary. Today, 12th of 7th month of 323th year of Ring, We, who survived, finished the preparation of rocket-transmitter. Tomorrow we will send that calculated... ...I switch on more... ...more... Something happened. What happened? That, that they collected... Rescued two. Blanca did not jump so far... elevator... We could not close doors, only second one. Mechanics reached the engines. They were struck by the planetary force. They, besides fury and horror, nothing. Seems that Kton also did not reach us. I am alone. I am alone. But I have hope. Before I begin... Brothers, if you find Sail, I warn you, never leave your ship. I have to investigate about Kton. I will explain in detail when I return. Where is the music? Where is the song? According to tradition, accepted among cosmonauts, let us recall our dead comrades. Dear friends. Thanks to you. We promise to return, and report your discovery to humanity. And convey your love to the Earth. I do not understand your indecision,Erg. You seem to be waiting for something. We will finish loading of anameson in 12 hours, and then we will be able to take off. Yes, Kay, as a commander, I am ready to give this command. But as a scientist... We met something unknown here, and the unknown kills. We are scouts, Kay. After us will arrive others. Tragedy of Sail cannot be repeated. Does it mean that the start is postponed? We must meet the unknown face to face. Eon is preparing one experiment. I have to feel, to see this myself. "Tantra", remove searchlight. Eon, light. Well, now we need patience. Look, Niza, this time you were able to persuade Eon, but from tomorrow I forbid you to participate in all actions beyond the ship. But commander, according to the timetable I am in the emergency group. I am not joking. Are you afraid, that I am here next to you? But nevertheless I will be next. Next to you - here, now, then... on this planet, on the Earth... Entire life. I love you, commander. And I can't escape this love. Well well. I will be silent. Just take it. These are the verses of very ancient poet. Take it for the memory. Printed? What old times. Now. Do you feel it? Tingling in the spine? I feel it too. Attention. Tantra. Kay, are you ready? Attention. Light. Well, what was it? - I hadn't time to examine. Something like feelers. Perhaps these are spectres, the clusters of the darkness around the charges of energy? No, no, it's clearly the creation of living material. And it tried to devour us. The monster has offensive reaction. No wonder that those killed had no time to note anything. Approximation of this is unpleasant, but we'll repeat the experiment. Kay, turn the light off. The creature is not alone. I think, one ought not to let it touch the dome. You are right. Tantra. Get ready. Let each look only to his side. Have never seen anything of the like. This will not be forgotten until death. Erg. We have to study these jelly-fishes. Jelly-fishes and spiral-discus. Are we scientists or not? We cannot miss this opportunity to learn, from where they came, who constructed them, what carried them to other worlds? That's why I propose a planetary expedition. Use of a planetary engine, is, of course, good idea. But how... It is decided. Only men will go. As in ancient times. - But Louma? - Louma is a doctor. I am a doctor too. You are, first of all, an astro-navigator, Niza. And you must be at your place. Very well. I will be at my place. I must be with him tomorrow. Next to him. Ridiculous. We will all be next to him. Is it really so hard to understand? You all. But it must be, first of all, me. Me. No-one must be close, no-one. Louma didn't feel well, she requested a replacement. If requested, it cannot be refused. We will clear it aboard ship. By the way, Kay... Commander, where are you going? Retreat. We have enough victims. We are not ready for this fight. Retreat. - She is alive, but... - She is dying? Not yet. The heart works, beating once in a hundred seconds. This is not death, but complete collapse. Consciousness, pain? Excluded. Absolutely. If collapse does not progress, it's all the same. She will sleep until we reach Earth. I fear however, her heart will not survive the strain of take-off. What do you propose? We'll prepare a special chamber. And then alter it into a floating emergency unit. Agree. As soon as you have everything completed, report to your post. We will remain here no more than necessary. Enough of the darkness and gravity of this black world. "For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings. That then I scorn to change my state with kings'." Everything is ready, commander. We can start. Just a moment, Kay. There are Louma, Eon... They must devise something. What an ancient melody. This is the melody of my distant ancestors. They lived here. They lived, they grazed cattle, they ploughed, loved... Veter, I do not ask. I am, somehow, sure. You will not leave expedition... You will not leave me. We will move to the sea soon, and you are certainly free to select any work, but... my friends like you. We are not children. When can we speak seriously? Only when Tantra returns. So I did not answer you. I thought, we will have time there, on Earth. Do you see... you do hear anything in your sleep? Do you remember about me? She does not hear. She cannot hear anything. You spoke, I am afraid to be close. Now I am next, and I do not fear. You have to rest. Regain your composure, commander. Erg. How long have we been with you? We saw much, even death, profound and absurd. You can't, you do not have a right to weaken yourself. - What else? I must say that contemporary neurology penetrates to the process of the appearance of emotions. I want to say that medicine creates the possibility to act on those cerebral centres, which manage the strongest experiences. And I could... Do you propose... to act on my love, and thus free me from the sufferings? Man must not suffer, Erg. Suffering deprive you of reason. But crew needs your reason She is right, Erg. I agree. Am I late? What's wrong? Carefully. Erg, what's wrong? Do you feel unwell? Here. 'That then I scorn to change my state with kings.' You did not understand anything. I will not reject my feelings, even if they force me to suffer. Suffering, if it is not superior to power... leads to understanding, and understanding to love. It is viscous circle. You were good to me. I'm grateful. But there will be no second session, Louma. You, the elders, who called me to the way of labour. Accept my skill and desire, accept my labour, and teach me both day and night. You are changed, Veter. Earlier, before you commanded the entire resources of the Earth spoke of distant worlds... Was I different? You smiled more, and was content with the simplest of things. You have changed greatly, Veter. What is he to you? We arranged to meet here. He flew in from Tibet. With Ren Boze they are preparing an important experiment. This is surely connected with his dream about compressing time. Obviously. And he needs me right here, at the presentation. - Excuse me. - Of course. Everything is provided by you. Now the most intensive part remains, the most dangerous. What scientist is afraid of risk? I'm not talking about myself, Mven. But the experiment will include the outer stations of Great Ring. Do we have the right to risk the greatest achievement of humanity, the window to the cosmos? I see billions of past lives, where instantly,as the sand between the fingers, ran away with their youth, beauty and happiness of life. They ask for an answer to the great riddle of time and exploiting it for space-flight. If you are so convinced, you should address the Council of Astronavigation. I address this deep concern to its chairman. I understand perfectly well. But I have not given my agreement yet. It's time you focused on the bigger issue. The Council does not see another candidate. You will give your agreement. Listen the report of the Council of Astronavigation. They return. They return. Veter, did you hear? Did you hear? They return. I am glad for you. Very. The ship is in one hundredth of parsec from the orbit of Neptune. During the week Tantra will be received by Hospital Triton and after five-week quarantine, the Earth will joyfully meet Tantra.
