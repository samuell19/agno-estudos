I think we got him now. Hold it there, please. -Hi. How you doing? -Open your coolers. Go on. Lunch Express. -Anybody hungry? -Oh, yeah. I'm starved. Hi, guys. How're ya doin'? -Let's see what we got. We got... -Lots of sandwiches. Ham. -Eggs. -We just got salads. -What about this? -Get down! Move your stupid ass on the ground right now! -Get down asshole! -You too! Move it! You! All available units, report to Union Station. Code Red. Over. Got it! Perfect. Traffic control, come in. Come in. Mia Rosa. Traffic control, come in. Come in. The whole city is gridlocked. What's going on? Unit 211. Officers down! This is the paper route convoy. We're being hijacked! Over! Over! Come in! Unit 211, we are unable to respond. All units are gridlocked at Union Station. Please stand by. -Lower! Lower! -Keep right! Keep right! Hit the lights. Beautiful. Come on. Open. Yeah! The United States Treasury. Oh, my God. Thank you. I can have anything I want? Almost anything. I want a monkey. You already have one. No, a real one. Sweetheart, don't you want a Barbie doll or something? -Oh, I know. -What? I want a cake like mommy made last year, with coconut all over it. I could do that. But I want you to make it, not buy it. Promise? I promise. But under one condition though. If I make it for you, you'll have to give some to the monkey. You're the monkey! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! I'll pick you up later, monkey. -Don't be late, monkey. -Okay. -Daddy... -Yeah, love? Can I give these to mommy? I think they'd make her happy. You see the blue and red fibers? Sure. Security threads on the left, and the micro-security code underneath Mr Franklin's collar. It's all there. Yeah, but what about...? It can't be traced because it's not counterfeit. You see, the disc is real, and the paper is real. I mean, why take the great risk to make a fake? When with a little extra effort, you can have the real thing. Give it to me. Give me the money. If your suspect has any other weapons that could be used against you, then by all means, you should shoot the bastard. Now the reason that the department has hired me is to train you in techniques that will allow you to apprehend your suspect without the use of your sidearm. For example, if you could please sit down. If your opponent attacks with a knife, you have one of several choices. One of which is to evade to the left... ...take the knife away. Or, you can evade to the right. Easy... easy... Better get this knife away from this guy. Okay, everybody on your feet. Let's pair up. ASAP now. B-side, let's go. Excuse me, sir. No shoes. Don't tell me no smoking either, right? I'm afraid so. You know, smoking can kill you. -What's that supposed to mean? -Pardon me. Pardon me, I don't mean to interrupt, but could I have a moment with my partner? Come on, man, be cool. The guy's here to teach us, huh? What are you busting on him for? What's up? They're dead. The paper route. You got it. -Twist the wrist in. And then down. -Right. Good. Very good. What are we doing to do about this? I'll figure it out. -We'll talk later. -Yeah, man. Don't fret, son. I too was once a worthless rookie. Look how I turned out. Detective! Maybe you'd like to sit in on a class some time. Okay. Hypothetically, let's say I'm me. And you're a worthless street cockroach. That's not too much of a stretch, is it? You'd be dead, amigo, if I'd of wished it so. Yeah. But you'd be sliced apart. If I had wished it, sir. Listen up, you heroes. You learn all the chop-sockie you want. But just remember this, the bad guys, they use guns. We use guns. Period. Father would have been very proud, Lukasz. Yes, little brother. He would've. -Let's check the new batch, huh? -Da. Okay, everybody. Have a break. Shut it down. Sarah, they're paying me a lot of money, but I can't go through with it. What should I do? Mickey, just get me the disc and I'll take it straight to the DA's office. Just be careful. Where are you going, Mickey? It's my lunch break. I want to take a jog. No one's allowed to leave the building. You don't trust me? You can search me if you want to. Come on, Boria. Give a girl a break, will you? Twenty minutes. Listen, Jack, I... I don't want to offend your friend or anything, but how does a guy like that become one of LA's finest? My friend? No, I don't think I can call him my friend. Partner, yes. Friend, no. Actually, I don't he has any friends. Nice guy like him? Tom, he's a great cop. Most decorated badge on the force. And I gotta hand it to him, the guy doesn't play favorites. He's definitely an EOD. -An EOD? -Equal opportunity dickhead. He treats everybody like garbage. Come on, Sarah, where are you? Hi. This is Sarah. You know the drill. Name, number, shoe size. Please pick up the phone. -Wait for the beep. -Come on, come on, come on! Damn it! Hello? Hello? Hi, Jools. Jools, I could've robbed this place and you wouldn't have noticed. I know where you live, Tommy. Besides, I got a cannon under the counter for such an inevitable occasion. Jool, man, you're scaring me. So what can I do you for? Well, I need some advice. Women. Treat 'em like gold. It's not about women. Oh, okay. The Niners and Dallas, then. Take Dallas with the spread. -No, Jools, I... -Hi. Jools, I need to know how to bake a cake. Butter, sugar, flour, eggs. You mix it, you bake it. You eat it. -That's it? -That's it. Thanks, Jools. Oh, God! Here it is, Jools. Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Jools, sorry about that. I need coconuts. Third aisle, on your left. Third aisle, on your left. I got coconuts. And who is this cake for, as if I didn't know? Stephanie's. How old's she gonna be? 5? -No, she's gonna be 6. -Six! Enjoy her while you can, pal. Blink your eyes and she's gone. I'm trying, Jools, I'm trying. So how's Mickey? I worry about her, damn it. Jools, don't worry. She's a smart kid. -Yeah. She is. -Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! What's the matter, girl? Daddy, you gotta help me! You gotta... What are you talking about? Mickey, hey, Mickey, Mickey, wait a minute, wait a minute. -Slow down. What's the matter? -Tommy... Oh, my God! You guys get the hell out of my store! Daddy! You want to be a big hero today like your best friend over there? She's a bad girl, this one. Running out on Boris like that. Oh, God, don't let them hurt me, please. No! Please! Daddy! Come on! Jools, Mickey, call the cops. Jools... Jools, talk to me. Jools. Tommy, I can't call the cops. Some them are in on it. What? Jools, no, no. No, no, no. Stay with your father, okay? Tommy, no! Daddy... Mickey. Mickey. Mickey, Mickey. I'm gonna get help. Yeah, yeah. Oh, God. Mickey? Mickey! Mickey... -Mickey... -You gotta let go, Jools. Come on. No... Did she give you anything? Tell you anything? No, nothing. That's exactly what you are. Nothing. Why are you such an asshole? Asshole? Let me explain something, my Asian amigo. I'm the good guy. I serve, I protect. That's my job. You do it long enough, you get a little cranky. Get out of here. I've got work to do. Tommy, how are you doing? You gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Look, go home. Try to relax. We'll contact you when we get an ID on the perp. All right? -Just let me know. -Yeah, all right. Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Very assuring. Very nice. Mr Slava. Did you get it? We had a little problem. Pull! There... there was this man... One man stopped you from doing what I asked? Do you have any idea how much your failure costs me with the passage of every hour? It won't happen again, sir. I agree. I completely agree. I'll get it back, Mr Slava. I swear. I know you will, Boris. Now go. Thank you, sir. Ilia, go! I would have killed him. Yes, you would have. See, that would have been a mistake. To put fear in a man's heart is easy. Anyone can do it. But to forgive him his failures, to trust him again, this commands loyalty forever. You know what I made in school today? You give up? A fingerpainting of you and me and daddy in a great big house. Trees, horses and a little monkeys. And guess what Daddy's doing right now? You give up? He's making me a cake. Just like you used to make. With coconut all over it. Envision the goal. See nothing else and achieve it. Ah, that's not bad, Yurik. You're still drifting a little bit to the left. Let me show you how it's done. Five. What's his name? Three. What's his name? Why don't you save yourself the agony and give me the name of your friend. You killed my daughter, you son of a bitch. I ain't gonna tell you shit. Give me the name of your friend! His name is Tommy Lee. I checked with our little birdie at the police department. Very resourceful, Boris. Very resourceful. You see that, Yurik? That's what I meant. Take an example. Thank you, sir. Ilia. Three wood. Fore! You know, the best bakers in the world are men. No, they're not. You know that? Yes. Do you know any of them we can call? Oh, that's very funny for a little monkey. Maybe you'd like a banana instead of a birthday cake. No. -Would you like that? -Daddy, you're silly. Get me some more. Now, come on, be useful. Garbage can. Garbage can! Garbage can! Okay, and he's in the corner with only three seconds left in the game. Is he gonna make it? -You're not gonna make it. -Yes, I am. Three, two, one. And he shoots! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! He makes it! He makes it! Tickle, tickle. I'll get it. Sweetie, check first, okay? Who is it? Sorry, my child. Is your mommy or daddy home? Daddy! Yes? Can I help you? Yes. Thank you. I'm a volunteer for the Sacred Heart parish. We are having a drive to help the poor. Sweetie, can you get a dollar from my wallet, please? Okay, daddy. Hold on. I'll loosen the chain, okay? I understand. Can't be too careful these days. The whole world's going to hell. Daddy! Daddy, I'm scared. Alex. Hey! What do you want from me? Give to us the disc. Look, pal, I think you got the wrong guy, 'cause I don't know what you're talking about. Stephanie? Stephanie? -Daddy! -Oh, baby! Come on, baby. Daddy. The keys. Daddy, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong, honey. It's okay. Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong, love. Let's go. Daddy, my monkey. That's all that's on it? No songs? I guess not, sweetie. -I'm gonna make a phone call, okay? -Okay. Hi. This is Sarah. You know the drill. Name, number, shoe size, card number and etcetera. Wait for the beep. Why the hell didn't you tell me about this when we were at the market? I didn't even know I had this tape. You know, all I wanted to do was bake a cake. Have you said anything to anyone about this? No. But there's one thing. Before she died, Mickey told me not to trust the cops. Now what is that all about? You heard about that hijacking, the convoy? -Yeah. The paper route or something. -Yeah. Well, rumor has it that convoy was given up by someone on the force. -Do you have any idea who? -Yeah. But I can't talk about this with you, Tommy. Come on. That's police business. Police business? My kid was shot at tonight. And somebody that I knew since she was a kid is now dead. And you're telling me you can't talk about this? Who are you trying to protect, Jack? Tommy, your friend was killed in that market today. If a bad cop had anything to do with that, or what happened at your apartment. What are you saying? What I'm saying is it's my responsibility. I'll take him down. Gresko? -It's Gresko, isn't it? -Ah, Jesus. Like I said, I'll handle it. You're a good man, Jack. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I wear a badge. Listen, you and Stephie, you're gonna need a place to lay low until this thing blows over. I've got plenty of room. No, I can't impose on you. What are you talking about, impose on me? Come on, man. What are friends for? He shot that guy! Daddy, what was that noise? It's okay, baby. Go back to sleep. Father Gil. Tommy? Father, I need to speak to you. Detective Gresko, this just came in. -Are you sure? -It's a perfect match, sir. Thanks. I won't be gone for long. But in the meantime, I want you to stay with Father Gil. I don't want you to go. I don't want to go either, sweetheart. But I need to find out who are those bad men that came to our house. What if something happens to you? Nothing's gonna happen to me. Promise? I promise. Give me a hug. Daddy, I can't breathe. I'm sorry. Father... Tommy, you take care and God bless you. Exercise extreme caution, gentlemen. Bring me this cockroach. That's all. Hey, Detective Gresko. I can't believe it was Tommy Lee. It makes zero sense. Listen to me, rookie. Jarvis and I had given 15 years to this force while you were masturbating on the lingerie section of the in the Sears Catalog. Lee is guilty as sin, and I want his ass brought down. -Come on, Gresko, let's... -Hey! Jeez. -You think you can handle that? -Yeah. He killed one of ours. Now, how much more you need to know? Hello? Sarah? How do you know her? Mickey? We used to room together in college. When's the last time you talked to her? She called me yesterday, saying that she had to meet me, that it was very urgent. She never showed. Sarah, if you don't mind me asking, what is that you do? I'm a secretary, the DA's secretary. How did you find me? She gave me something with your name and number written on it. Something? Hey! Hey! Go! Halt! Go ahead. Shoot. Are you in on it? What the hell are you talking about? It was Jarvis that gave up the convoy. Now I said, are you in on it? Go to hell. Get in! Stop! Father, I still can't prove anything right now. A Detective Gresko came by yesterday looking for you. What did he say? He gave me his car, asked me to call him if I see you. What about Stephanie? I think he saw her but he didn't say anything. She really misses you, Tommy. May I speak to her, please? Yeah, sure, she's right here. It's your dad. Daddy! Hi, Stephanie! When are you coming home? Soon, honey, soon. Did you forget about my birthday cake? No, I did not forget about your birthday cake. In fact, that's all I've been thinking about. 'Cause you know why? Why? Because a promise is a promise. -Right? -Right. -Daddy? -Yeah, love? Are you in trouble? Now Stephanie... I don't want you to worry. Things are taking a little time, but everything's okay. I love you. I love you, too, daddy. -Bye, monkey. -Bye. Atta girl. Detective Gresko? He's doing okay. Yeah, I think we have something here. Come on, you guys. Let's move it! Let's move it out! Come on! Go! Go! Go! I got some coffee. Thanks. And there's milk and sugar in the bag. Nah, this is fine. You said Mickey gave you something with my name on it. What was it? A tape. May I see it? You're bleeding. What? Your shoulder. Must have been from the glass. Are you always this caring? She's very beautiful. She means everything to me. You know, I'd like to have a child someday. What's the matter? Go! Go! Go! Damn! Sarah? Sarah's dead. Why? Because we pay her a lot of money, Mr Lee. In fact, too much money for stupid mistakes, Karina. He doesn't have the disc. I knew you'd fail. We trusted you, Karina. He said he had it. And you believed him? Yes. You stupid bitch! Why don't you leave the girl alone? What? I said, leave the girl alone. He must be quite taken with you, Karina. To stand up for a woman who just betrayed him. It's almost poetic. I like that. No! Yurik! Here. Get yourself cleaned up. You're a brave man, Mr Lee. You want to save the day, serve justice. No, I just want my life back. That's a reasonable request. Let me tell you what I want. I want to resume the operation that I've been forced to suspend, because I believe you have something that I need. -I'd like to help you... -Then give up the disc. Don't interrupt me. I need to let you spend some quality time with my brother here. You both have something in common. You both excel at hurting people. Though, I must confess, I think Yurik enjoys it more. Goodbye, Mr Lee. If I don't see you again, it's been a pleasure. Stay here with them. You know what I want. Now, tell me. Go find it yourself. Stephanie? Stephanie! Hi, mommy. I know you're busy but I need a favor. I want you to ask God to help daddy. He won't tell me, but I think he's in trouble. Mostly, he can take care of himself... ...but he might need some extra help this time. Well, that's all I guess. I love you, mommy. You expect me to believe that shit? That is worth dying for. Boris, keep an eye on him. I gotta take a shower. What happened? The disc is in a phone booth if he didn't lie. You are a good boy, Yurik. A good boy. I'll have the disk for you in one hour. Alright. Transferred, four different wings. I want ya to get... Some global... Anyway, like I was saying.... -What's the matter... -I'm sorry, friend, I'm in a rush. I didn't know! I didn't know! It's all yours! There is nothing here. You find him. You! Look... ...you shouldn't go around hurting people. And why is that? Because they might just hurt you back. No! This one is mine. Come on, guys, let's go! Catch him! Quick! Let's go! Got him. Highway one! I'm going to head him off. Get me to the other side of the tunnel, will you? Take her down. What's going on? You can ride shotgun. I'm in the tunnel. What? You're breaking up. I can't hear you! What? Miss Jones, can you get me a complete financial report on Jack Jarvis? Yes, sir. -Hello. -Father Gil? May I speak to Stephanie, please? I'm afraid your daughter is busy getting ready for her last rites. Unless you show up with the disc. Alone. You hurt her and I'll kill you, you hear me? Stephanie? Stephanie? Where is my daughter? Where's my daughter? Go ahead, hit me! Your daughter will spend the rest of her life trying to forget the night her daddy died. Karina! Daddy! Stephanie? -Did they hurt you? -She's fine. The disc! Don't hurry my daddy! -Karina, shoot the girl. -No! No. Baby. You okay? -Father? -It's alright. Honey, I have to borrow this for a little bit, okay? Baby. Move! This is the house of the Lord. You can't just march in here and do this. We just did, old man. Well, well, well, well. Last words, Mister Lee. You've killed a lot of innocent people. And for what? For greed? You may call it greed if you like. But I prefer to refer to it as prosperity. So I leave you to your futures. Brief as that they may be. No! Our plane is waiting. Thank you. Ilia... Make it look like an accident, all right? Nothing fancy. A faulty gas valve, an explosion... ...a fire, that sort of thing. What about the little girl? I said all of them. And I meant all of them. Ilia... After she's done, get rid of her. Detective Gresko? Talk to me. I have the information requested. Nothing unusual in Jack Jarvis' account. Get a load of that. An hour after the paper route hijacking, 500,000 dollars was wired into his daughter's trust account. Son of a bitch. Something wrong, sir? He didn't have a daughter. Karina, are you gonna kill my daughter? Shut up. She's only 6 years old. I said shut up! Yurik is right about you, Karina. You can't even kill a bratty little kid! You don't know me very well, Ilia. I don't have any problem at all, killing. Karina, don't listen to him. Do it, Karina. Do it! If you don't, I will do it! Do it! Karina, no! No! Tommy... ...I would never hurt your daughter. Karina? Goddamnit, Jack. Goddamnit. Listen, it sounds like the police. Are they back on your side yet? Not without that disc. Then you better get going. Please take care of her for me. Okay. Yeah, the Long Beach Airport, Detective. He can probably use some help. Sir, my daddy didn't do anything wrong. Don't hurt him. I know. Listen, don't you worry, okay? Home sweet home. Well... -Persistent, isn't he? -Da. The lesson here is to never let a woman do a man's job. Put one in his head. Come on! Hurry! I'm going to kill you. Once and for all. Come on, Yurik! The party's over. Freeze! Freeze! Let him go, Lee. Let him go! I got him. You, on your face! On your face now! First the cop and then you. Come on, Yurik. -Are you alright? -Yeah. Damnit, they're getting away. You're gonna be all right? Alright. Don't worry, we can easily make it. Lee's in the corner with only 10 seconds left in the game... Ten, nine, eight... What was that thing he was carrying? Game over. Hey! Hey! Amigo. I guess I owe you an apology. Don't get soft on me, Gresko. It's not your style. Yeah, you're right. As long as you know I was doing my job. Yeah, I know. Say, you think a guy my age could learn to do that stuff? What stuff? You know, that stuff you do. I'm serious. To show I'm serious, I'm gonna quit smoking. You're gonna quit smoking? Yeah, I'll quit smoking. You know what, I think they're here for you. Oh, hey. Take care of this guy. You see? It's not that bad. We'll get you stitched up in no time. Hey! Where you going? I got a cake to bake. ...my daughter Stephanie. May she grow up to be a good person. And that her life be filled with joy and laughter. -Amen. -Amen. Are you ready? One, two, three, go!
