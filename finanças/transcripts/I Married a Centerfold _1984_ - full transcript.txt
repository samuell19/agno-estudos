Because it costs-- Centerfold channel, $30 bucks extra a month. [knock] BILL: It's open. Oh. Kev, where you been? Working. I was going over the plans from that test this afternoon. Kevin, you want us to deal you in? Not this round. I'll pass. Anyone thirsty? I am. I want a beer. Kevin's not a big gambler these days. He's saving for his windmill fund. His what? Yeah, he's going to revolutionize the energy business. Right, Kev? KEV: You got and sodas bill? Picked up some caffeine free stuff just for you today. How thoughtful of you, Bill. BILL: And now meet Debra Bryan, Centerfold's girl for November. An award winning horse woman, Debra is also a down home ranch girl who hails from one of those small California towns filled with sunshine and wide open spaces. Living in the country is really special to me. I grew up on a ranch where everything was, sort of, rough and ready. Oh, boy, listen to that voice. Who's she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? Betty Boop. All right, how much to stay in? Buck and a half. I fold. Take your pennies. BILL: Hey, Kevin, got the drinks? Got them right here. (SINGING) She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl. She's a very sexy girl. Three jacks, read em and weep. Damn. I can't win anything tonight. BOB: Hey, Kevin. Kevin. - Huh? - It's your deal. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's your deal. OK, now we're playing. How about a beer, my man? DEBRA: And I've trained horses since I was a little girl. It's a great challenge. I wouldn't mind if she challenged me. Let's go, Kevin, five card draw. This is a wonderful life, but I don't believe that you should settle for anything just because it's safe. Now that's beautiful. Good legs, not too frail. She's built all right. I was talking about the horse. Warm blooded. Good cross with thoroughbreds. How do you know so much? You want one? Several. What are we playing here, cards or ponies? Looks like brother Kevin's playing a game all on his own. DEBRA: You have to hang on to your dream even if they seem impossible to accomplish. If there's something that you really long to do, you've got to go for it. You've got to give it that one great try. Who is this board? Kevin in drag. DEBRA: I enjoy the physical pleasure of riding. I bet you do. DEBRA: I guess that's why the outdoors is such a thrill for me. Well, if you're thrilled, we're thrilled. Five card draw, I got eight cards here, Kevin. Oh, sorry. DEBRA: I guess at heart, I'll always appreciate the simple, natural way of life. Yeah, baby real natural. BOB: And if that's simple, I don't want to meet. Complicated. Give us a break. Come on, you guys. Cut it out, OK. NEWSCASTER: Centerfold's very special girl for November. Next, a rare and revealing interview. Uh oh, I think we hurt somebody feelings. Let's just get on with the game fellas, huh? Well, I'd rather get back to what's her name. Her name is Debra Bryan. My god, you remembered her name. I'm impressed. Maybe he likes her. Oh, there's nothing wrong with that, but she is out of your league, Kevin. What do you mean she's out of my league? Come on, Kevin. The woman's a centerfold. So what? So that's strictly fast lane and big bucks. She seem very down to earth to me. Come on, Kevin. Did you see her? You couldn't get near her. Who says? Yeah. BILL: I say. What are you going to do walk up to the Centerfold Castle and introduce yourself? Go to the town where she lives. - What town? - Corazone. They just showed it. That's just a few hours from here. You're pretty confident, aren't you? I'll tell you what. Let's forget this nickel, dime stuff. What do you say me and you make a real bet? What kind of bet? $500. [groans] Hey, you can use $500. What are we betting about? Your centerfold, Debra Bryan. I bet that you won't get off your butt and look for her. And if you do, you can't find her. And if you find her, you'll never make it with her. Hold on, Bill. Why don't you ease up? BILL: He's never even been in a singles bar. You would make-- really make a bet about this? Sure. I'm worried about you, Kev. I think your wind machine is finally taking its toll becoming an expert on hot air. Forget it, Bill? He's not going to go for it. He'll go for it. He'll go. BILL: He's gonna do it. You bet. He's gonna do it. He's going to show us all that he's not all talk and no action. Aren't ya, Pal? OK, you're on. [excitement] [music playing] NICK: Hey, Kev. Kevin? Yo, Kevin. Rise and shine. I brought you two little sandwiches for your big trip. I've got to go to work. On Saturday? You remember out little bet you made last night? What? Oh that. I was joking. Those guys just razzled me. Nobody took that seriously. Well, your friend, Billy, sure did. Nah, he'll forget about it. Let me tell you a little something about the facts of life. You make a bet. You win, he pays you. You lose, you pay him. Thanks for the advice, Nick, but I'm telling you he was just giving me a hard time. He was serious, Kev. Well, I wasn't. Kev. Come on, Nick. If you want to go on a wild goose chase, be my guest. You seemed pretty confident last night. That was last night. All right, fine. You saw something you wanted last night, let it go. You want to build windmills. Forget it. Forget everything. Oh, thanks. You agree with Bill I'm full of hot air. That's not what I said. You have an expressive face. She was beautiful. She was more than beautiful. She-- you saw her. She's glamorous. She probably has eight bodyguards. Look at me. Who am I kidding? You're right. I mean, what would I say to her? Would you and your bodyguards like to come to dinner with me. My friends bet me $500 that I couldn't meet you. Kev, say no more. When you're right, you're right. How would you track her down? And if by some miracle you did, what could you possibly say to her? Hi, my name is Kevin Coates. Debra, Kevin-- Kev. I saw you on TV the other night. [music playing] Hello, are you Ms. Bryan? Well, of course you are. I have been watching you ride, and you are simply fabulous. Hey, don't I know you? Yes. We have met before, haven't we? Yes. We have something in common. What is it? I am interested in horses. That's it. I own a horse. [music playing] (SINGING) What I want you got that might be hard to handle. Like a flame that burns the candle. Candle burns the flame. Well I got both stock of hopes and dreams are scattered. And you pull them all together, and how I can explain. Well, you. You make my dreams come true. [tires screeching] You. You make my dreams come true. On a night when bad dreams become a screamer, when they're messing with a dreamer, I can laugh it in the face. Twist and shout. I wake out and wrap yourself around me. Because either way, you found me. And I'll never be the same. Well you-- OK. Congratulations. Mr. Wise Guy, you found the house. Now what? (SINGING) You make my dreams come true. Hi. My name is Kevin Coates. I saw you on TV the other night. Ridiculous. Kev. It's now or never. [engine revving] Oh! Hi. Need some help? No. Hi. Yes. I mean, I was looking for you. I mean, I was hoping I'd find-- Someone who could pull you out? Well, this must be your lucky day. I know. You do? Looks like you're going to need a tractor. Yes. Oh, you think so? Yeah. Yes, I think so, too. Well, that's a good thing we've got one. Oh. Don't go to any trouble. Oh, it's no trouble. Just go right on over there to dad's stable. I'd help, but I got to get going. See y'all. Bye. Hey. Hey, wait! Hey, I wanted to talk to you. Ouch. What did you say your name was? Kevin Coates? You asking or telling. My name is Barnet. How do you do? Fine in a pinch. Where you from? Los Angeles. Well, that's your misery. I have a horse. Well, that's my misery, too. Where's he at? Who? Your horse? You didn't ride him on those freeways, did you? No. No turn signals You're darn right. Tail up will stop traffic. What kind is he? What? BARNET: Your horse? Oh? English jumper? Yes, yes. Oh, that's good. Because that's her specialty. Oh, good. Throw that right over here. You are looking for a treat, aren't you? Yeah, absolutely. Well, she's the best one around. You should be. She's my daughter. Put that over here. right there. And the horses like her because she's so good looking. It runs in the family. Right. She's vain, though. Stopped telling her age when she hit 35. 35? Yeah, she rode over to the doctor, she threw her back out. Happens every once in a while, since the kids. Kids? But she can rope a spear better than me. Still, though, sometimes I wish that husband of hers hadn't have left? Husband? Yeah, turned her kind of mean. Well, that just about does it. You want to make an appointment about that horse of yours? Well actually, I think I better get back to LA. I'll call some other time. Well, suit yourself. But you'll need a number. We're unlisted. If my daughter can't help you, you can try Debbie, she's my granddaughter. Granddaughter? Debbie? I'll tell her you're going to call. You do that. Thank you. Thank you very much for everything. OK. [music playing] [phone ringing] Vic, I got to talk to you. Well, Bill wants to talk to you. Oh, good. Listen, I got an idea. I'm sure you do. You're chock full of them. I need you to help me when I go down there again. Again? Go back down there again? - Yeah. - You went. Sure, I went. Listen, remember the name of that guy-- - You really did it? - Yeah. - Did you find it? - What? The house, the ranch where she lives? Oh of course he did. Kevin, you're too much. Yeah. I got to find out-- Bill is going to be so mad. Did you meet her? I saw her. Well, we saw each other. All right, that's close enough. That's a met. Listen, I got to get in touch with that guy. What was his name? - Hey, Romeo. How did it go? Just checked out the sweetest stereo. I had my eyes on it for weeks. Look, I saw it in your favorite magazine. Hey, let's see. Nick, would you put that away please? He met her. I don't believe it. Bill, what was the name of that guy the other night with the horses? Did you talk. Yeah, at the poker game. No, to her. - Yes, I did. - He did it. That's it. Did what? What was his name? Who? That guy, the horse guy? Ed Weeks. Weeks. Where does he live? I don't know. Tahoma. Anyway, he's out of town for a month. Kevin, did you really talk? Do you know what time the library stays open till? Hey Kevin, look, we got to figure out in about our bet. OK, OK, three levels of jumping. Open, immediate, and green horse? Green horse. Green horse. OK, then there's gate confirmation, hunters, jumpers. And that's it. I got it. [phone ringing] [piano playing] Hello? KEVIN COATES: Hello. Is Debra there? No. No, she's not. Who's calling? This is Kevin Coates. I was there the other day. You're the boy who wound up in the ditch. Right. WOMAN: You're looking for a trainer? Yeah, I'm not happy with the one I have now. Well, what stable are you using? Windmill. Windmill Stables into Tujunga. Windmill? I don't know them. Well, what kind of horse have you got. It's an English thoroughbred. Oh, hunter. He's got a fine game and a wonderful, wonderful constipation. WOMAN: He's got a what? A wonderful confirmation. WOMAN: Well, sounds good. Oh, what level? Oh, he's a preliminary hunter, green belt? You trained this horse in karate? Green horse. Green horse. I'm not sure if he's ready to move up, and I-- Well, if you're looking for a new trainer, me or my daughter Debbie, we can do it for you. So what say if you come over here on Wednesday. KEVIN COATES: Day after tomorrow? That's right. We'll see you then Oh, and bring your horse. Thank you. Bring my horse? Where am I going to get a horse? Can't you rent one? How am I going to get it down there? They got those trailers with the little port holes so the horse can look out. Yeah, but it's Wednesday. I can't get the day off. It's not going to work. Could you come calm down? I'll cover for you here. Don't worry about it. Yeah, what about the horse? You don't have it anymore. I don't? I just bought it. Now, you have to go back for another one. That is perfect. That's great. Deb was really that nice, huh? Yeah. She's going to have to be. Why? You're in pretty deep with all this horse stuff. You better get the record straight and soon. I will. I forgot to get food. He's going to pay. [music playing] Whoa, boy. [music playing] Leslie, you've got to gather him in more. All right. He wasn't flexing. Leslie, you gotta drive him up underneath. Take a break, honey. Pull him down. Hi, there. You must be Mr. Coates. Kevin. Hi, Jeanette Brian. Where is your horse? Well, I made a decision. Sounds serious. I sold him. Well, it's not easy owning a thoroughbred. Yeah that's exactly what I thought. And my kind of work, I figured I should just own a leisure horse. Quarter horse, 10 hands, top balance, clean stride, clean lunge. You want something for a Sunday outing? Exactly. Well, we got plenty of those. I'll tell you what. Why don't you walk over to the barn and look around. See if you see something you like? Great, that's great. Howdy. My name is Kevin Coates. Hey, I know you. Aren't you a friend of Mr. Ed's? Hi, there. [horse neighing] Down, by. You look like you'd be easy to get along with. [music playing] Hi. KEVIN COATES: Hi. How's your Jeep? It's fine. Fine. I didn't get a chance to thank you. I mean, you disappeared. Gramps says you might be looking for a trainer. Yes. Well, no. Not anymore. Truth is, I don't have a horse anymore because-- I sold it. He wants a Sunday horse. Thought I'd show him Bruiser. Bruiser? So you're Bruiser? Prefer the right side or the left? [neighing] That's-- I agree with you. Absolutely right. Hey, make up my mind, would you? [whinnying] Oh, it's a beautiful animal. Just admiring the lines. You sure are one big horse. [horse huffing] You know. I'd really like to work together. No? Well, let's try, OK? Heel. Heel. Heel. You're in trouble now. I asked you nicely, and you refused. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Stay. Wait, go. I need those reins. Can you go? Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Left, left. It's easier this way. [whistling] Hey, easy horse. Easy. Want to go for a ride? I am riding. Whoa, whoa. [whinnying] Great. Whoa. No problem, this is fun. Whoa. [music playing] Don't be scared. Come on, let's go. Hey, watch out! Whoa! Whoa! [whinnying] Are you OK? Thanks, Bruiser. [whinnying] He usually jumps. Well, some animals just lose their spirit. Happens at the best. You think you want to buy him? Well, I don't know. You want to ride another? We've got plenty. Maybe we should just let this one sink in for a while. I guess country riding is a little bit different than what you're used to, living in LA. Yeah. God, I love it out here. I always wanted to live in a place like this. I've always wanted to live in the city. Really? Well, I guess the grass-- - --is always-- Greener. Hey, did you get changed OK? Yes, fine. Thank you. Would you like some lemonade? Oh, don't go to any trouble. It's no trouble. Sit down. Relax, make yourself comfortable. My daughter don't put on airs, even though she is famous. Mom. Let's now talk about what I do, OK? Do you know my daughter is a celebrity? Well, actually-- I'm sure Mr. Coates isn't interested in who I am, or what I do. Oh, no. I didn't mean-- I mean, I am interested in you. I mean-- Debra is a model. She's been on TV. Had her picture in "Centerfold" magazine. Mom, please. Let's not bore Mr. Coates with talk about my career. There is nothing boring about it. Unless you think so. Do you? No it's not boring. Debra is the biggest thing that was part of the country since the two-headed calf. OK. You ought to see all the fan mail she gets. She gets fan mail from all over the country, right? Right. Can't imagine some of the creeps that crawled out of the woodwork because of that piece. Anybody who would fall in love with somebody after just looking at their picture, you're just seeing them once on TV, isn't someone I'd like to know. Some very important people read that magazine. Only mom and I disagree about what important is. Mr. Evans has been very good to you. Very good, don't you forget that. Besides, this week is the real test. What's this week? "Centerfold" convention. Every year, the magazine invites all its advertisers to this big bash. And all the girls get invited, and they get to meet some very prominent people. She means R-I-C-H. Got your list ready, Jenny? Yeah, Gramps, it's on the desk. Listen, don't forget the fly swatters. Can you drop me off? Where? My rehearsal. He's going in the opposite direction. He's got to get right back. Besides, the barbecue is almost ready. I'll drop you. Where is it? It's out of your way, too. That's OK. It's on the other side of town. I'm in a play. That's terrific. You Ready? Sure. Thank you very much for everything. Bye, Gramps. Bye. There's something about that boy. Can't ride worth a damn. But I like him. He'll buy a horse? GRAMPS: Give him some time. Figure out he really wants one. Oh, I think he knows what he really wants. I think he's just figuring out how to get it. [chatter] I'm so glad you're here. Billy had to help us down with a broken mower, and couldn't make it for the rehearsal. Daniel is fit to be tied. Oh, dear. Kevin, this is Kitty Stalver. Hi. Do you want to go find a seat? Yeah, sure. Gosh, he's awfully cute. Don't you think? I don't know. And in the morning, earlier they found the bed, untreasured of their mistress. Untreasured? Untreasured, dear boy. That means she's gone. Left without a trace. The way I'd like to be. Well, why don't you just say so? He's from the Old Globe in England on a travel grant. And I don't think Corazon understands. All right. That'll do, everyone. Has Debra arrived yet? We've got to move ahead. She's changing. Excellent. Dare we attempt the balcony scene? Are those lights working yet? Pretty much. Let's give them a shot. Pretty nice. Rotten language. Can I have someone to read for Bill who's gone after a mower? Where's the stage manager? She's gone across the street. Is there anyone here who can read a script? You. Who are you? Kevin Coates. He's a friend of Debra's. Oh in that case, you at least have some taste. Would you be so kind? But I can't act? Don't worry, Mr. Coates. You are in excellent company. Now all we need from you are cues. If you would just stand right there recite the lines. Places. Lights! Begin. How came thou hither. The orchards are high and hard to climb, and the place death considering who thou art? With love's light wings did I or perch these walls, for stony limits cannot hold love out. By whose direction founds thou out this place? By love that first did prompt me to inquire. I am no pilot, yet word thou as far as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea. I would adventure for such a merchandise. Oh, gentle Romeo. If thou does love, pronounce it faithfully. I really think I do. I really think I do. Mr. Coates, what text are you using? I lost my place. Just read the lines please. Lady by yonder blessed moon, I swear. Oh, swear not by the inconstant moon. Less they love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by? Swear by the gracious self, and I will believe thee. OK. I swear OK. Did you say OK? Mr. Coates, I have been a faithful student of William Shakespeare for several years. And I can assure you the word OK has never, to my knowledge appeared in any of his works. I'm sorry-- Just jumped to the end, Debra. My bounty is as boundless as the sea. My love is deep. The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite, dear love. Adieu. Debra, wait. All right, that's it. I need a break. I hope I didn't do too much damage. It just seems too real. Maybe it was. Well I think you're a pretty good actress. I think it's just a matter of time for some producer discovers you. No, really. You're good. I saw it. Well, I just fear that with the classes and training, I might have a chance. It's not such a long shot. Oh, yes it is. I'm from the country. I haven't a chance going up against growth who are more sophisticated or have the right connections. That's why the "Centerfold" thing was so helpful. You mean, that's why you posed for the magazine? It was an option. I want to act, and it gave me the money to afford to study. I knew what I was getting into when I posed for "Centerfold." I'm not ashamed of it, and I'm not sorry I did it. Sometimes you just gotta take what you have and build from there. Most people don't regret the things they do. They regret the things they never tried to do. Look at me, I can't even take my own advice. What do you mean? Well, I'm still staying at home, working with Mom. And I really should move to the city and pound the pavement. I talk a lot, but-- I think I know what that's like. Coffee? Yes. Two coffees, please. Is there something you've always wanted to do? Yeah. Build a wind system. A what? Wind-powered energy. Sort of like old windmills, only the blades, when they turn, feed a generator. Then you step up the voltage, and distribute the amps along a grid to an entire community with a backup system a whole town can be completely self-sufficient. No power companies, no pollution. It's just so hard to get it organized. Financing. DEBRA BRYAN: And? Well, the truth is I guess I'm a little scared of it. Not that I think I can't do it, I can. It's just-- I haven't leaped in. You will. Thank you. Thank you. I really like what you said before about regrets. I never thought of it that way. Thank you. Maybe we can help each other. Turn here. KEVIN COATES: This doesn't look familiar. DEBRA BRYAN: It isn't. You've never been here before. This is it. You mean, you don't live-- With my mom? No. This used to be Gramp's house. He moved in with us after he hurt his leg. So when I wanted to place of my own, I loved here. Sure is peaceful here. Yeah. That's what I love about it. It's late, isn't it. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I mean, it's really late. I didn't realize. You've got such a long ride ahead of you. Yeah. Well, I'd better get on my horse. I was just thinking. Well, it will take you almost three hours to get home. And the roads aren't the greatest, especially at night. I guess what I'm trying to say is, why don't you stay? This is nice. Sort of low tech. More like no tech. I like it. It's old-fashioned. A person who talks about windmills should be used to old-fashioned things. Do I strike you as old-fashioned? You seem to have old-fashioned values? Straightforwardness. Honesty. There's something I've got to tell you, Debra. No. There's something I want to tell you first. You thanked me before for helping you, but I want to thank you. You're the first person I've met since I've been in "Centerfold" who doesn't want something from me. You seem to see me for who I am, and what I want to be. [music playing] Do you play? Piano lessons, age 10. This is Macbeth. Do you sing? I want to. But no. Why not? My voice is kind of soft. I bet if you just let yourself go, you could sing beautifully. Will you sing for me? Someday. Soon? Soon? OK. Someday soon. This looks uncomfortable, but actually it isn't. Will you take this out? I'll get some pillows. I think it's a blessing in disguise you saw me as a "Centerfold" girl. Debra, I really need to talk to you. Yeah? There's something I have to tell you. What's the matter. Just an over-appreciative fan. What did he say? That he'll search me out, find me, and sweep me off my feet. I hate that more than anything. I'm glad you're not like that. I'm tired. I'm going to go to bed. Will you be OK? Yeah, sure. I'll be fine. OK. [music playing] I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. [music playing] [bed creaking] Ah. Ah! Ugh. You know the saying out of sight, out of mind? Yeah? Well, I don't want that to happen. Here. Oh, no, no. Don't open it till you get home. Will you call me. I'll be the city tomorrow. I have to get ready for the convention. Is that a yes? Oh, here. Bye. Whoa. Do you believe in love at first sight? I guess she likes me, huh? Likes you. Listen to her. What did she say when you told her? The little story, the horses, the bet? Uh. She still doesn't know? Oh, my. Would you give that back, Bill. What did you do, send away to "Centerfold" for this? Yeah, sure Bill. Can I have it back, please. Only thing I can't figure out if the handwriting is yours or Nick's. The consonants are mine, and the vowels are his, OK. Give it here. Well, it looks like Kevin wins, Bill. No way! For bringing a picture to work? Come on. The guy obviously met her. Not necessarily. Hey guys. Look at who Kevin is dating. What's the matter with you. I'll tell you what's the matter with me. We're talking about a person here, a human being. Not some think you to ridicule. I'm not ridiculing anything. I'm just not sure this isn't another figment of your overactive imagination. You don't understand, do you? Bill, what I'm trying to tell you is that I'm not playing your game anymore. Now if you want your $500, I'll get it for you.k as far as I'm concerned, the rest of your bet is off. Let' get back to work. Looks like he's got your number. Kev, you got to be careful. He's still the boss. Why put up with that guy? Christ. Financial necessity, pure and simple. Financial necessity or just lack of guts. OK. She still wet from the stain. So be careful when you're buffing her. Oh. Hey, baby. Hi. Hey, you look terrific. Oh, you look fabulous. The press people are going to be stunned. How was your rehearsal? Great GRAMPS: How did you get home? Kevin. He's nice, isn't he? He's a heck of a cowboy. I've seen nicer. I like him, Ma. The most honest man I've met in months. And he's probably the poorest. What does he do for a living? He's a designer. Of what? Windmills. Windmills. Where does he think he is, Holland? He's got a good job. Huh. Dymo Products. He probably works in the mailroom. That'll do, Jenny. Debra. You are very lucky in that you are an extremely attractive young girl. And you happen to have some friends over at "Centerfold" magazine who've been very helpful to you so far. Baby, I don't want you to let that brass ring slip through your fingers. Oh, no. OK? OK. OK. All right, now you have a good time. And be sweet. OK. About what time are you going to be home tonight? I don't know. I might want to see some friends. Not-- not Mr. Dymo Products. You wouldn't waste your time on somebody like that. It's not wasting time. Debra. Debra! I am talking to you. I'll see you later. Bye, Gramps. Debra! No. No, she can't do that. You've been pushing that girl ever since I can remember. I want her to have a better life. You mean you wanted to have a better bank account. Well, that's not so bad either. She's not going to end up scraping dirt upon underneath her fingernails, because she is to be somebody. She already is somebody, but you've never been able to see that. Oh, oh Windmills! Windmills. I bet he never even had a horse. Oh, stop. Where are you going? In Tujunga, could you give me the number of Windmill Stables please? There isn't any? Thank you. If I know my daughter, there is nothing that she hates more than a liar. And a liar is somebody who will never be there when you need him. [music playing] [chatter] Get Saludos, he's the best. Kimberly, you look fabulous. And get Tomlinson to give me 1,000 yard, not now. And get Tomlinson to get me 1,00 yards-- [chatter] Hi, sweetheart. You set with costumes? Please get on it, OK? Listen Frank, did you set that meeting with Cliff? I wanted to know what I'm doing here. Dolly, come with me. Get a memo to Cliff about Friday night. There she is. Don't you look lovely? This month's main attraction. Debra, this is Dolly. She'll show you the ropes. Oh, hi there. Hi, darling. OK, girls. Listen up. Come on, stand over here. Stand next to me. On the other side of that door is the press, the people who will make or break our annual product and advertisers convention. I want you to go out there, and I want you to charm the pants off them, because I want Cliff to be real proud of the work we've done so far in preparing for this event. Is that clear? - Yes. OK. Those of you have never done a product convention before will be paired up with big sisters to help you out. Any questions, ask them OK? OK. Let's go out there and be beautiful. [applause] OK, fellas! Here they come. [chatter] Quit pushing! Come on, we'll get it. [cameras snapping] I've been waiting all year for this. OK, folks. Here we are. Assembled for the first time in one place, the most beautiful women in America. The "Centerfold" girls. [applause] OK, December. What do you think of Los Angeles? I think it's my kind of town. They going to keep you busy? I surely hope so. REPORTER: Doing what? Everything and anything. Why do you think men love December? Because it's a time for giving. Hey February, aren't you going to go sightseeing? Haven't you got it backwards? Well, has Los Angeles welcomed you? Absolutely. They gave me a key to the city. Well, what's so unusual about that? Well, it only opens the bedrooms. [laughter] They're eating it up. Hey November, aren't your horses going to get jealous about all this attention you've been getting. Of course not. November, come on. Don't you like to ride bareback? No, actually I prefer English. Well, how does it feel to be this month's centerfold? Made any lasting impression? A lasting impression? Well what about your career? Will it be boom or bust? I guess you could say it's both. I understand you're interested in acting. Had any bites lately? Besides producers, that is? [laughter] No. I haven't. OK, folks. That's just a sneak preview. How about some shots right now, OK? REPORTER: Debra, smile! No, no, yes. Mr. Evans. Debra, I'm glad you're here. - I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Not at all. In fact, I was just thinking about you. Seemed a little shy this afternoon. Did I? I didn't want to be used to sell products. Debra-- I thought it was going to be some sort of show or something. Of course it's going to be a show. Didn't they send you a script? No. For what? I'm going to kill that Brody. We're going to have a talent show this year, sort of a new faces revue. I guess with all the confusion, I forgot to tell you. I'm sorry. New faces? Sure, you sing, don't you? Well, do you have anything prepared? There's not much rehearsal time. There is something-- OK, good. After the product show, you come up to the palace, and we'll get you ready. This is very good. It's going to be very good for you, Debra. Thank you. You've been very kind to me and I appreciate it. Hi, Debbie. You getting along OK today? [workers murmuring] Hi, Debra. Hi. Do you know why Kevin Coates works? Yeah right down there at the end? Thank you. Is that? Coates' pin-up. Let's go. Oh, no. Hi, is this-- Hi. Kevin Coates works? Oh yeah, he's right there. That's the place, but he's not right here right now. Do you know when he'll be back? Any second, I hope. Debra. Oh, hi. I thought I'd come by to say hello. Is that OK? Yeah, sure it is. [clearing throat] Oh, this is my friend, Nick Bellows. Debra Bryant. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Ernie Krieger. Good to meet you. Bob Waters. And Bob. Kevin has told us all about you. Well, he hasn't really told us all about you. He just showed us your picture. I got carried away and brought it in. Aren't you guys a little busy? Don't you have some work to do? We just want-- we just want to see here. In the flesh? Well, well, well. Bill Bodell, Debra Bryant. We have certainly heard and seen a lot of you. Hey listen, Bill. Johnson called he really needs to talk. Yes, actually. I'm not really sure I'm glad to see you. - Bill. - Why not? I don't know. I just get the feeling it might cost me something. Bill, don't be a jerk. Bill is a big cost-benefit man here. In fact, I thought Kevin made it all up. But I still want proof. Proof? He means proofs. You know, like architects proofs, graphs, things like that. Oh. Are you ready? Well, you win some, you lose some. See you later, fellas. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Nice meeting you. In your case, Bill, you lose some. OK. OK, open your eyes. This is it. It's beautiful. Someday, this whole valley will look completely different. Subways and skyscrapers? No, windmills lighting up the whole city. I wanted to bring you here so you would see I'm not just dreaming. I knew that. I believe in you. I believe in you. [music playing] Guess what? What? They've offered me a chance to sing tomorrow. That's wonderful. They're having a sort of talent show at the palace. They invite casting people and agents. Maybe something might come of it. Of course it will. You're very special, Debra. No one knows that but you. I have never had anyone tell me that, believe in me before. Maybe that's what I like about you. Well, now you know. What? How I feel. Debra, we have to talk. We are talking. But I suppose it's a little embarrassing. No, it's not. I mean. You know how I feel about you. You're about shyest person I've ever met. I don't mean to be. It's weird. Most men, they just sort of walk right up. I think they feel they're supposed to, or something. But with you, I can't even tell if you like me. Of course I like you. I like you a lot. Then why don't you show it? I won't bite. Won't even growl. I have something I need to tell you. What's that? [music playing] Hello? Hello? Can I help you? JEANETTE BRYAN: Hi. Is Kevin Coates around? No, he's not here. Well, actually I'm looking for my daughter. Are you Mrs. Bryant? As a matter of fact, I am. Oh, I'm so pleased to meet you. You're as lovely as your daughter. How do you know Debra? Debbie, my goodness, she's famous. We watched her on TV. Who? Sure, me, Kevin, just about the whole office. What a night. They went crazy for. Kevin, especially. So, Kevin had seen her before? Oh sure, didn't he tell you? That day he went looking for Debra at your ranch. Of course, he needed a little prodding. $500, jumped right at it, which surprised me a little, because Kevin's not usually a betting man. Funny, isn't it? Not really. But it works. I mean, the man seems to get just what he wants. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? It certainly does. Where does Kevin live? 359 20th. Thank you, mister? Odell. Bill. My pleasure. Anytime. - Since for me. - No! Yes. You said you would. Not now. Come on. [doorbell rings] Hello, Mrs. Bryant. I have nothing to say to you. I just came to get my daughter. Where is she? KEVIN COATES: Mother? Debra, you get ready. We are leaving. What are you doing here? You have no right to come here. I don't think you that you're going to want to spend one more minute with this fellow. It's none of your concern who I spend my time with. Oh, well I think that Mr. most Honest Man I Ever Met left out a few minor details. I don't care what you're talking about. Mr. Coates does, don't you? Are you going to tell us about that horse you sold? You know the one with the green belt in karate? Mother, mother! Are you going to tell us about the $500 bet you'll meet with your friends about my daughter? Will you tell me what this is? There's some things I haven't told you. I never owned a horse. Well, that's OK. And when I came to see you, it was on a bet that I could find you. And that was after he saw you in the "Centerfold" channel. You saw that? Yes. I was playing a game of cards with some friends. I know that sounds terrible, and I thought you were so beautiful. And they bet me that I couldn't meet you. So it's all a lie? No, it's not. Everything about who you are, about who I am, about who I could be? No, no. All of that was true. And all other things I've been feeling about this. Because of what you said. Debra, you've got listen to me. Not anymore. Debra, let's go home. Debra. [music playing] [phone ringing] I'll get it. Hello. Hello. Mrs. Bryant, is Debra there. She is not here. Would you leave a message for her. Young man, I think that you have done enough damage around here. And if you take my advice, you won't call here anymore because Debra's just not about to talk to you. Who was that. Evans. Mr. Evans? Yeah. He just wanted you to know how much he's looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night. Hey Kev, come on wait up. How you doing? Not good, huh? Look, I don't want to talk about it. Hey, we always talk. There's nothing to talk about. It's over. It's not over. So she found out about the horse stuff, all right. That doesn't mean it's over. Yes, it does. Do you love this woman? Look, I blew it OK? Can we change the subject? No, we can't change the subject. Do you love her? What difference does it make? It's not going to happen. You haven't answered my question, Kev. What the hell do you want from me? Of course I love her. Then go get her. Listen, pal. I'm getting really tired of your pep talks. I'm warning you, just get off my back. You're warning me? I'm terrified. Watch me. What are you going to do about it? - Do? - What are you going to do? Why don't you do something for a change? Why do you want me to be someone I'm not? You know? You push me, Nick, because you're the one that's stuck, isn't that right? Isn't that right, Nick. You want to know something, buddy? You want to be a loser. It gets you off the hook. [music playing] Oh god, I'm sorry. ANNOUNCER: Where the most luxurious native-grown products are being presented for your appreciation.

Take your sheet music. [applause] I asked a girl out the other night. Talk about a girl who was anxious. She was dressed as a bride. I said hi, she said I do. And you know something? I'm also that we can see all these wonderful young ladies here today, because each of them is filled with, how do you say it? Hidden talent. You know what I mean? Got bodies like record players, 38, 45, 78. Hey, you! ANNOUNCER: Anyway-- Stop. Stop, I said! But I really respect the women of today.

Come on, honey. Come up here. Don't by shy. Ah. Don't you just love shy girls? Huh? My mother always told me shy ones make the best wives. Well, that's what she thought. [laughter] But I like the women of today. I really do. They're very modern. I love them. Turn around honey. Turn around. Turn around. Or do I have that backwards. [whistling] Yes, the modern women of today, they're very independent. [plates crashing] I like a woman who's well-developed, right? And thinking, right? Right? Well, are you ready? Yes. I brought my music. She brought her music! Isn't that something? I'll tell you, honey. They really don't want to hear that. The folks really want to get acquainted. So why don't you oblige, huh? Drop your clothes and walk down the ramp. Nobody told me about this. You lose your top, and you walk straight ahead. MAN: Rip it off! Come on, are you kidding take it off? Sure. [men shouting] Debra Bryant, ladies and gentlemen. Debra Bryant! [women screaming] [music playing] [men hollering] MAN: Like a Christmas tree! [whistling] [applause] [music playing] [men hollering] [applause] MAN: Oh, baby. [music playing] Come on! [music playing] Oh, no. Don't. [applause] Come on, do it. MAN: Take it off. What are you doing? Get out there. Give me some girls on stage quick. Just a minute. Where do you think you're going. You told me I was going to sing? Sing. What do you think this is? Mother Goose? I'm not taking my clothes off for you or anyone else. You're a damn "Centerfold," what's the big deal? Get your hands off me. Hey, Doll. Get one thing straight. You're a two-bit pinup. I have 100 people out there waiting to see you, and I have 500 other girls waiting to take your place. You cross me now, you will never, never work for me again. I wouldn't work for you if it was the last job on Earth. Debra, what's wrong? I couldn't see what's going on? I'm not going through with this. Yes, you are. Listen to me. You came here to sing and be noticed. That's exactly what you're going to do. Not this way. You don't understand. Debra, I understand what? You're making a big mistake. The only mistake I've made is always doing what you tell me to do. Oh, what are you talking about. That's not true. Don't to know anything? JEANETTE BRYAN: Debra, look. They wanted me to strip. I love you, mom. And I know that you never tried to hurt me. But I need to live my life, follow my own dream. You didn't get your dreams. And that's why you hurt so much. Please. Help me to get mine. I need you. Please. It's OK. It's OK, honey. We are going home. No, you're not. What are you doing here? Who do you think you are? You're not going home. You're going to go out on that stage and finish what you started. Get out of my way. Yeah, every Saturday night, everybody was dragged into a Chinese Jewish takeout restaurant called Sum Dum Goy. Run by a guy named Wingtip Shoe. Yeah. Ah anyway, speaking of wingtip shoes, and I see you're wearing a pair sir, down front. Yeah, what? I hope your pension and welfare is paid for. OK, you want an amateur, you got him. May I have your attention, please? Please, may I have your attention. You don't know me. Just hold it right there. Debra once talked to me about courage, about going after things that you believe in, no matter how impossible it seems. I believe in what she said to me, and I believe in her. She gave me the courage to try things that I only dreamed of without being afraid. Now, maybe you want to continue with what you came here to see. But I believe in Debra. I believe in her talent as an actress and as a singer. And I would like it if you would give her the chance to sing her song. MAN: Let her sing! [applause] I love you. [music playing] (SINGING) Been running from my dream. Afraid to fall, afraid of trying. You. You've been running, too. Now, it's clear. Together we can't lose. Oh, you want me to reach out for that star. And I want you to listen to your heart. Together, we can be stronger than just one of, I've found my dream. Because now there's no more reason to hide. Now there's no more dreams to cry. I know what I'm searching for. And I know it's mine. Because in my life, now there's someone like you. [music playing] And now, there's no more reason to hide. And now there's no more tears to cry. I know what I'm searching for, and I know it's mine. Because in my life, now there's someone like you. [music playing]
