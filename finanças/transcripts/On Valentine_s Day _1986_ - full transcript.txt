[ Church bells sound ] [ Typewriter clacking] -Merry Christmas, Elizabeth. -Merry Christmas, girls. Merry Christmas. This will never wear out on you, Mr. Speak. Hi, Frankie. Mims, I'll be right with you. Merry Christmas, sir. Thank you, Frankie. Merry Christmas. Hello, Frank. Hello, honey. Hello, honey. I brought you some food from the restaurant. Oh, thank you, darling. All right, Mims. Have a nice Christmas. A Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Horace. So, what do you think, Mr. Speak? [ Knocking on door ] Come in. Hello, Mary. Hello, Bessie. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. I brought you a present and I brought the baby a present. Oh, thank you. There's a present for you, too, under the Christmas tree. Sit down and visit, Bessie. I'm so glad you came by. -Merry Christmas. -Thank you. I'm here all alone in this big, old rooming house. Horace is workin' late at the tailorin' shop, and then, he's workin' tonight at Mr. Dixon's store to earn a little extra money, so I'm all alone. Well, you have a piece of candy, Bessie. I don't mind if I do. [ Knock on door ] Hello, Mr. George. Is Horace here? No, sir. He's still at the store. What time do you expect him? Not for a while yet. You tell him I was askin' for him. -Yes, sir. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Mr. George Tyler's off again, Mama says. Are you scared of him? No. He looks harmless enough to me, poor thing. Mama says he's gonna kill someone if they aren't careful. She says he's rich and kin to everybody in town, and that's why everybody looks the other way no matter how he acts. He's not kin to me. Is he kin to you? No. He's kin to Horace, but only by marriage. [ Children laughing ] This is the first Christmas I've spent away from Mama and Papa, Bessie. Is that so? Yes. Last Christmas was, I think, the most unhappy one I'll ever know. At least, I hope I'll never know one more unhappy. Why was it so unhappy? Well... Papa, by then, was so determined that I wasn't to marry, and was so unpleasant and in such a bad temper anytime Horace came near the house. I finally asked Horace not to come anymore. And that's when I started slippin' around and meetin' Horace at the ice cream parlor and the picture show. Of course, Mama always found out about it every time I did something like that, since she has spies all over this town. Mrs. Cookenboo was her main spy, but she had her lieutenants all around. They sent me to Galveston in the summer to visit my aunts. Mama and Papa kept hoping if they could get me away long enough, I would meet someone else and forget Horace. And then, Allie Douglas married Hector. And she was almost my closest friend. Allie Douglas? Is that Allie Dockery? She was Allie Dockery. She's Allie Douglas now that she's married. -I know her. -Of course you do. -Her papa's state senator. -Yes. So, Horace and I decided to run away and marry. The day before we were to elope, Papa came early. And he was all nervous and excited. Well, I almost had a heart failure. But it wasn't about my elopin'. He was upset because a sheriff had come to him about the hangin' of that man that robbed Mr. Azerley's grocery store and killed him. Do you think Allie Dockery is pretty? Yes, I do. Do you think she's beautiful? Yes, I do. I think she's beautiful. Anyway, as much as I am against public hangin', I was glad, let me tell you, that he had this on his mind that night and wouldn't be payin' any attention to me. Goodnight, Papa. As the night grew nearer, I began to get waves of almost nausea, and I swear I had a fever. I went to bed as soon as I could, but I couldn't sleep at all. I began to think of Clark Ferguson then. She was the first friend I had that died. Do you remember Clarkie? -No. -Sure you do. No, ma'am. Well, I don't see how anybody in this world that knew her could forget her. But I never knew her. Oh, you were bound to. You've just forgotten is all. Anyway, I heard the courthouse clock strike 11, and I began to think of Clarkie then. So pretty and sweet, dyin' at 16, and here I was, about to defy my parents and run off and marry. And I began to cry. And I was sobbin' so... ...that I was afraid I would wake my Mama and Papa or my brother. So, I got out of my bed and I opened the window, and I looked out at the night, and I thought, "I'll never be lookin' out this window again any more after tonight. I'll never be in this house anymore until after I'm married." What's your papa's name? Vaughn. Henry Vaughn. My mother's name is Mary. Maybe that's why you call me Mary. You get my first name mixed up with my mama's. When do you open the presents at your house? In the mornin'. That's when we open them at my mama's and papa's, too. -It's a lovely supper, Charity. -Thank you. -Papa. -Yes, sir? May I-- may I borrow the car tonight? -What for? -I wanna visit some friends. -No. -Papa, please. No, Brother, I want you home on Christmas Eve. Mama. No, Brother. You heard your papa. [ Sighs ] We got a letter from Laura and Dora. And they seem well and happy. Did Clarkie Ferguson have black hair? -Yes. -And curls? -Yes. -Then I knew her. Of course you did. Mr. George is back. Mr. George? Can you tell me how to get to town? I've forgot. Why yes, sir. You turn right. [ Train whistle sounds ] Where is the train bridge? Well, that's to your left. That's where the town used to be. Yes, I've heard that. Before your time and mine. Yes, sir. I heard that you and Horace eloped. Yes, sir. And your mama and papa still haven't forgiven you? No, sir. I hear you slipped off to Allie and Hector's house for the wedding. Yes, sir. And I heard the Methodist preacher refused to marry you out of friendship to Mr. Vaughn, your father. You and Horace then asked the Baptist preacher to marry you, and he agreed. But first, before the ceremony, he said he wouldn't perform it unless you called your father and told him what you were about to do. And you phoned him. And he begged you not to do it. He said you'd live to regret it. Well, Papa, I'm sorry you feel that way. Goodbye. You married on Valentine's Day. Yes, sir. At 1:00 in the afternoon on Valentine's Day. I turn to the right? Yes, sir. How many blocks to town? Two and a half. Do, uh-- do you have the time, kind sir? Headin' toward 5:00, Bobby. Hey, do you want a drink of whiskey? I don't drink. Uh, do you mind if I have one? No. Well, here's to your health. [ Courthouse bell rings ] [ Dog barks ] Mr. George Tyler is on the phone. He wants to know if you remember the name of the man who killed Mr. Buck Davis. Les Freeman-Constable. He also wanted to know if he was black or white. I said he was white, but he wanted me to ask you. Well, tell him I said he was white. Yes, sir. He also said for me to tell you that he thought you were the conscience of the whole town as well as the county. Well, tell him I think he's very kind to think so. ELIZABETH: ♪ O little town of Bethlehem ♪ How still we see thee lie ♪Above thy deep and dreamless sleep ♪ ♪ The silent stars go by [ Knocking, clears throat ] I'm sorry. I'm sorry to disturb you at this time of the night, but I'm lookin' for my mother. Oh, Mr. Bobby, she's gone to your brother's in Bay City. Is it Christmas? Christmas Eve. -Uh-huh. Christmas Eve? -Yes. What's the year, please? 1917. 1917. -Are we at war? -Yes. [ Chuckles ] He's drunk. Horace? -Hmm? -Are you goin' home? Oh, yes. I sure am, Miss Ruth. -I'll walk with you. -Mmm, all right. Are you busy? All day and night people were spendin' money like it was goin' out of style. I know. [ Chuckles ] -Hello, Cousin George. -Hello, Horace. -Merry Christmas, Cousin George. -Merry Christmas. [ Chuckles ] Well, I am glad that I don't have to clerk in a store every day. -It's a godsend. -Yeah. I don't know that I could stand it much longer. How do you stand it, Horace? Oh, I don't mind it, especially when we're busy. When it's quiet and there's no business, I don't care for it too much. Well, my feet are killin' me from standing all these hours. Don't your feet hurt you? No, not too much. I'm gonna soak mine in hot water before I go to bed tonight. Oh, um, did Elizabeth hear from her mother and father? No, not unless she heard this evening. Oh, I was so hopin' that the spirit of Christmas would embrace them and they would forgive you both. I saw Miss Vaughn uptown this afternoon and I almost took it upon myself to tell her that I thought since it was Christmas, surely she and Mr. Vaughn could find it in their hearts to forget and forgive their daughter, but then I remembered that Miss Maddie Darling told me that she had seen the Vaughns, uh, just before Thanksgivin', and she said to them right on the steps of the Methodist church, "When are you gonna stop this nonsense and forgive Elizabeth?" And she said that Mrs. Vaughn said, "I thank you very much to mind your own business." Hm! Don't you think they know that Elizabeth is expectin'? I don't know. Well, surely they've heard by now. Someone must have told them, don't you think? I don't know. Oh. All right. I'm certain that the birth of the baby will reunite you. Well, I hope so for Elizabeth's sake. She doesn't ever talk about it, but I know she misses her family. Oh! ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm -♪ All is bright -BOBBY: Mama? Mama? She's not here, Mr. Bobby. She's in Bay City. She's gone to your brother's for Christmas. What a pret-- uh, pretty Christmas tree. Could I-- could I come in to see it? Why certainly. I don-- uh, I don't believe we have a Christmas tree this year, 'cause I've been all over the house. I can't find it. I hope to get what I want for Christmas, but I know I won't. What do you want? I want some guinea pigs. Mama says I'm too old for them. I was married to the sweetest girl, you know. She, uh-- she was quite a bit taller than me. She was a real treasure. Uh, she-- she left me, though. She couldn't stand the climate in this part of the country. "It rains so much here," she said, "it's a wonder that you all don't have webbed feet." I came home one day and she was gone. And it-- you-- it was many years before I could find out where she went or I'd have gone after her, try to get her back. She broke my heart. Mama says that's what I get for marrying somebody beneath myself. She said it never works out. Mama says bein' born common is like a, uh-- like a curse, 'cause you can't do nothing about it. Well, common or not, I said I loved her. I loved her so. Where's Horace? He's still workin', Mr. Bobby. He's always runnin' somewhere. Here, there, and everywhere. [ Chuckles ] "What's he work so hard for?" Mama said. "To get in the good graces of Mr. Henry Vaughn," I told her. Mr. Henry Vaughn, his son drove by here as I was, uh, leavin' home. His son drinks, you know? Drinks like a fish. I said, "Does your daddy know that you drink like that, boy?" He said, "No." Said, "He'd kill me if he knew it." [ Chuckles ] [ Whispers ]: Brother Vaughn is her brother. Whose? -Mary's. -That's right. And Mr. Henry Vaughn is her father. [ Distant chatter ] And Mrs. Henry Vaughn is her mother. Oh? They don't speak to her because she eloped. That's right. I remember that now. -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas. Mm. No, no. [ Laughs ] -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. I have a little something here for you, Elizabeth. -Oh, why, thank you. -There you go. There's a present for you, too, under the Christmas tree. Oh, how nice! Oh, how sweet. Oh, why, Mr. Bobby, what are you doin' here? Why aren't you in Bay City with your mama? We were reminiscing here about the old times. Oh. Merry Christmas. Oh, why thank you. That's sweet. I think I'll just sit a minute. Uh, did Mr. George Tyler ever find you? He came by here twice lookin' for you. I passed him on the way over here. And I said, "Merry Christmas, Cousin George," and he said-- he said, "Merry Christmas" to me. He said nothin' about comin' here. When they wouldn't take me in the army, I went down and I tried to join the volunteers, but they wouldn't have me either. They said I'd never stay sober long enough to teach me anything. "Hell, Bobby," they said, "if we had to depend on you to guard this town from the Germans, we'd be in a bad way." [ Knock on door ] Horace, you think we're gonna win this damn war? Well, hello, Cousin George. Why don't you come in? No, I can't stay. I'm on my way to church. This isn't Sunday, Cousin George. What day is it? It's Tuesday. Christmas Eve. Oh, yeah. I forgot. I came here to wish you Merry Christmas. Well, thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too. You know, I bet Horace has lived in more houses than any one of us. Hey, Horace, how many, uh, places have you stayed in? [ Chuckles ] Bobby, I couldn't begin to tell you. It would take me a night to remember them all. Mama used to worry about you growin' up. "What's to become of that boy?" she said. "He-- he lives like a orphan." "Why, he's no orphan," I told her. "He's got a mama." "She's-- where is she? Why isn't she here taking care of me?" Has he gone? Hm? Yes. Steve came and took him away. Hey, Horace, how long has your daddy been dead? Well, let's see, uh, 16 years. Ah. What, 16 years? Well, my Daddy's been dead a lot longer than that. I don't know how long, but I was a baby, they'd say, when he died. Oh, you weren't a baby. You were a grown man. -I was? -Yes indeed. [ Laughter ] Miss Elizabeth, how old were you when your father died? He's not dead, Mr. Bobby. He's still alive. That's right, yeah. No, but he don't speak to you. No, he doesn't. -Hey, Steve. -Uh, Horace, can I--? Um, uh, Papa sent me in here to ask you over to the house later on tonight. Well, he says he wants to have a long and private talk with you. Uh, Steve, it's Christmas Eve. I've been workin' all day. Yeah, I know. I told Papa that, but he says to tell you it's life or death. [ Sighs ] All right, all right. I'll be over in a little while. Thank you very much. What's goin' on? -We'll go up the street. -No. Home's over-- -I don't wanna go home now. -Papa-- "And in the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David... ...of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in onto her, and he said, 'Hail thou that are highly favored. Blessed art thou among women.'" Horace. I called over to your house just now to try to stop you, but you were already gone. Papa's fallen into a deep sleep and we don't wanna wake him. And he hasn't been sleepin' much lately. -I'm sorry. -Oh, no, that's all right. Well, Merry Christmas. Oh, Merry Christmas. [ Whistles ] [ Dog barks ] [ Whistles ] Mmm! How sweet.

She said, "Do you know who this is, Elizabeth?" And of course I did, and I said, "Mama." And she said, um, "Yes." And then, she said, "Merry Christmas." And I began to cry, and she began to cry. And then, she said, "May we come over in a few minutes? We have a few presents we'd like to bring you." And I said, "Yes," and that was it. Oh, Horace. We have to get presents to them some way. I'll just die if they come here and we have nothing for them. Well, we can't do anything about it now. All the stores are closed. Didn't you close up for Mr. Dixon last night? Yes. Then you must have the keys to his store. Oh, that's right. Hurry down and-- and get something for Mama, and Papa, and Brother. -What shall I get them? -I don't know, Horace. I can't think, I'm too excited. -Use your own judgement. -Well, honey, I can't-- I-I don't know-- I don't know what to get them. I mean, your Papa doesn't smoke. Uh, no. He likes Big Red Bandanna handkerchiefs. Get him some of those. Get Mama some toilet water, and get Brother some linen handkerchiefs. Hurry. [ Sighs ] -Mary! -Come in, Bessie. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Mary, I got my guinea pigs! -Oh! Mama said she just said I was too old for guinea pigs to throw me off the track. I can't ask you to stay because my mother just called and-- and she and my father are on the way over. -Did you have a happy Christmas? -Oh, yes. My Mama didn't get a thing she wanted for Christmas. She said that the housecoat Papa bought her was the ugliest thing she ever saw and she got so mad, she threw it at him. I bought her a pair of bloomers, and she said that four of her could get inside of 'em, so I have to return 'em for a smaller size. Papa has a headache. He says he's never known a happy Christmas, and this year's no exception. Thy-- thy-- thy kingdom come, thy will be-- kingdom come. [ Sighs ] Now I lay me down to sleep and I pray the Lord my soul to-- [ Thumping ] [ Muttering ] [ Thumping ] [ Knock on door ] -Elizabeth. -Come in. Elizabeth, is Horace here? No, he's gone to get presents for my family. They just called to say they were comin' over. Oh! Oh, how nice. Oh, well, I wonder if when Horace gets back, he could look in on Mr. Bobby. I think he's sick. Well, I wouldn't wonder. He was very drunk last night. He is moanin' so loudly, and then, every now and then... [ Knock on door ] -...he lets out a scream-- -Is Horace in here? No, Mr. George, he's gone to the store. Brought him a little Christmas present. Well, thank you. Not much, you understand, just a little remembrance. -It's very thoughtful of you. -Yes. Oh! Hello, Cousin George. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. Horace, your cousin George brought you a Christmas present. Well, that's, uh-- that's very kind of you, Cousin George. Thank you. Why don't you come on in and visit? Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't. Merry Christmas. -Well, Merry Christmas to you. -Oh, Horace... Did you know that your Aunt Mary and I were in love with each other? If we had married, you would call me Uncle George instead of Cousin. [ Chuckles ] Well, no, sir. I-I didn't know that. I wonder if that's true about your Aunt Mary. Well, I wouldn't know. I'll open this later. I think it's a handkerchief. Well, it's the thought that counts. I got the presents for your family. Oh, good. Now, Brother's handkerchiefs are initialed. Oh, yes. I got 'H' because Henry's his name, though everyone calls him Brother. Well, that's what I would've done. Um, Horace, you didn't hear Mr. Bobby as you came in? No, ma'am. Oh, I was just tellin' Elizabeth that he kept me awake half the night with his moans. Uh, would you come see to Mr. Bobby? Please, Horace? I don't like to go in his room, you know, because sometimes he sleeps without his clothes on. Uh-huh. And take this trash on your way out, Horace. -Oh! -Okay. [ Guinea pig squeaking ] Brother! Brother! You better get down here right away if you want a ride with us. I'm comin', Papa! [ Knock on door ] Bobby? [ Sighs ] Bobby? Bobby? Bobby? Oh, how sad. And on Christmas Day, too. [ Horn honks ] Brother! [ Horn honks ] Will you get in this Buick now? If you wanna get along in life, you'll have to learn to be on time. Well, he's quiet now. [ Gasps ] Elizabeth, look at this. What is it? It's ten one-hundred dollar bills. Mercy! [ Car arriving ] They're here! [ Guinea pig squeaks ] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mama. -Merry Christmas, Papa. -Oh, Lizzy. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Brother. Merry Christmas, Sister. Oh, my goodness. Who are all those for? Well, they're not all for you and your old man. There's some presents here for a future member of the family. Hello, Horace. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. Merry Christmas, Mr. Vaughn. Well, uh, thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too. Our room is in here, Mr. Vaughn. Oh. I'm so embarrassed. I've never seen so many things in all my life. Uh, we just got simple things for you. They're mostly things for the baby. I see you have a crib already. How nice. Yes, they had a sale last month, so we decided to buy one then. I'm glad we didn't get one, then. -Do you have a buggy? -No. Then don't get one. Your Papa and I have one put aside. Oh, Mama. These are for the baby, and this is for you. Thank you. -And this is for you. -Oh, thank you, Brother. Oh! [ Laughs ] Oh, how lovely! Oh, my, my. I thought you should have something pretty to wear when you stay in bed after you have the baby. What do you want, a boy or a girl? -Oh, I don't care, really. -Huh. Oh, this is very nice. Thank you. Oh, it smells nice. Yes. Oh, Elizabeth, look. My, aren't they pretty? Sure are. Thank you. Well, they're my favorites. Thank you. You can never have too many. I hope the shirt fits. Mr. Lewis said it would. It's a 15 neck. -Well, that's my size. -And a 34 sleeve. Well, it's perfect. Oh, thanks. I can never have too many of these either. It's got my initial on it. How's college, Brother? He doesn't apply himself. I would've thought that he would've learned at Allen Academy, that you have to study if you wanna make grades. But they're too lenient at Allen Academy. A&M is not lenient. If you don't study and make your grades, you'll be kicked out. There were so many rich boys at Allen Academy. There was a great deal of gamblin' goin' on, and carousing. I'm afraid Brother sometimes gets the wrong idea of things. But his Papa let him know he was not gonna be like the Darst boys' father and spend his life gettin' him out of scrapes, that if he makes his bed-- [ Guinea pig squeaking ] Why, Bessie! In all this confusion, I didn't see you standin' there! Merry Christmas. Yes, ma'am. Merry Christmas. [ Guinea pig squeaks ] I have to go home now. All right, Bessie. She's over her a lot. She's been a lot of company to Elizabeth. Mr. George Tyler is off again, they said. They can't get him to eat, he accuses his wife of poisonin' his food. It's so sad for them all. He went runnin' out in the front yard late yesterday with no clothes on. -Naked? -Naked. A fine Christmas they will have. Oh, he's had these spells many times before, you know. They try to keep it quiet, but of course they couldn't. Well, he was just here. He seemed all right to us. He brought Horace a Christmas present. Did he? What did he bring you, Horace? Ten one-hundred dollar bills. My goodness. Wasn't that generous of him, Mr. Vaughn? Yes. I attended the last public hangin' in courthouse square. They don't allow 'em there anymore. If they hang you now, it's in the jail. Yes, sir. Merry Christmas, Mr. George. -Merry Christmas, Sheriff. -Merry Christmas. You remember the year they freed the slaves in Texas? Oh, no, sir. It was a long time ago, though. I know that. Before I was born. June 19! That is the day that you celebrate your emancipation. I remember that. Yes, sir. That's the day all right. It sure is. Yeah. Well. Here's a Christmas present for you. Thank you, sir. How is your mother, Horace? Oh, she's, uh-- she's well, last I heard. Horace's mother's not much of a letter-writer. No. I've never met your stepfather. Have you met him, Elizabeth? Oh, yes. Uh, just after we were married, we went down on the train to Houston and spent the Sunday with them. I had a fine Christmas. I got $20 from Mama and Papa, a set of military hairbrushes, a wristwatch, cufflinks, a pair of gloves. Look what I got. Oh, Mama, it's beautiful. Cost a lot of money. I'm sure it did. I know what it cost. Well, how do you know? Huh? Saw the price tag before you took it off. Well, what did you get, Papa? Nothing as handsome as this. Oh, I'm pleased. An umbrella, which I badly needed. Bedroom slippers, a nightshirt, socks, and a tie. What did your Mama send you all? Well, their presents haven't arrived yet. You know the mails at Christmas. Nothing is ever on time. I'm sure they're sitting in the post office right now. They know, of course, about the baby? Oh, yes. I wrote them. I'm sure they're pleased. Oh, I'm sure they are. Um, they haven't written back yet. Like I said, they're not great letter-writers. [ Grunts, moans ] [ Gasps ] Oh, dear. Oh. I remember my brother Billy worrying so about you on Christmas, Horace, when you were a boy. I was very close to my brother Billy, you know? Oh, yes, sir. Elizabeth said you were. He was very smart. It's tragic he died so young. I always had hopes that Brother would follow in his footsteps and study law. Papa, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to disappoint you. I want to make a lot of money just like you have. Did you know, Horace, that before Mr. Galbraith shot Mr. Mason, and his bank was so unsteady because of all the money they had loaned the farmers during all those years when they had so many crop failures-- What's the point of your story, Brother? The point of my story, Papa, is that the bank would've gone under with all the money owed it they couldn't collect if you hadn't taken $50,000 of your own money and given it to them to use. You have to see how they act when Papa walks in. They just jump up and dance when they see him. I guess you both are plannin' to go to Mr. Galbraith's trial? That's gonna be a good one. I bet $2 Mr. Galbraith will be convicted and sent to the pen. -You bet? -Sure I did. Easiest $2 I ever made. He's guilty. He shot Mr. Galbraith and killed him. They're gonna send him to the pen. I am not discussing his guilt, I'm discussing your betting. I thought you'd learned your lesson at Allen Academy. I thought you'd given me your word when you were suspended from there never to gamble or wager again. Please, Mr. Vaughn, let's don't spoil our Christmas. Well, it's spoiled for me, thank you. To think he's not learned his lesson about gambling. I have, Papa. I won't ever go near dice or cards. I swore to you I wouldn't, and I won't. You can gamble without the use of dice or cards, you know. Well, my God, I'm sorry I mentioned it. I didn't mean a thing in the world by it. If I win, I won't collect the bet. We all know he's guilty. He's going to the pen. Well, let's change the subject, for goodness sake. It's Christmas Day. [ Knock on door ] Elizabeth! Oh. I hate terribly to bother you all, but, well-- Well, I'm sure that, uh, Horace and Elizabeth have told you about poor Mr. Bobby. -No. -No? Oh, well. He is D-R-U-N-K. Uh, did you call the doctor? Yes, I did, but as you know, he's so small and slight, he feels he can't handle Mr. Bobby by himself. So, he says he needs the help of two strong men to help hold him down. -I'll give you a hand, Horace. -Oh, thank you. Oh. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, Bobby. Hey, uh, I'm lookin' for my mother. -Yeah, she's in Bay City, Bobby. -Oh. -Merry Christmas, Bobby. -Uh-- -Is this Christmas? -Yes it is, Bobby. -Oh. What's the year, please? -It's 1917. -Are we at war? -Uh-huh. Uh, Mr. Henry Vaughn, uh, he wouldn't take me when I volunteered my services. He said I wasn't good enough to serve my country. Uh, that's not true, Bobby. You're certainly good enough, but you see, we have certain physical standards. -Who are you? -Henry Vaughn. That's right. And he did try to join several times, and that's certainly commendable. It makes you sick the way some of them do anything to keep out of it. Lonnie Bigelow shot his toe off to keep out of the army. We can't be sure of that, Brother. It might just have been an accident. Wasn't no accident. It was deliberate. Lonnie Bigelow told Steve Mason if shooting one big toe off didn't keep him out, he'd shoot the other one off. Here you are, Bobby. I've been lookin' all over for you. Who are you? Why, I'm Dr. Goodhue, Bobby. Now, you know who I am. What do you want with me? I want to give you something to quiet you, make you feel better, maybe even sleep a little. You're not giving me anything. You're not making a dope fiend out of me. Uh, you made a dope fiend out of Harry Newsome, sticking him with needles, but you ain't doin' it to me. Now, Bobby, that's not true. You know that's not true. Harry Newsome says it's true. He's a dope fiend. And he says that you're responsible. Bobby, Bobby, you're drunk. You don't know what you're saying. I know what I'm sayin'. I was in the saloon the night Raymond Happ came in, and he walked over to Briggs, the saloon keep. He says, "I told you if you sold my daddy another bottle of whiskey, I'd kill you." And he, uh, uh-- He took out his gun, and he killed him, and they let him go free, 'cause they said Briggs had made a drunkard of his daddy by sellin' him whiskey. And, uh, uh, they're gonna let Mr. Galbraith go free, too, 'cause I-I bet Brother Vaughn $40 they would. -Bobby, Bobby-- -That's $40 final. I'm sure, I'm sure. Now, come with me now. Oh, take your goddamn hands off me. You son of a bitch. Hey, Bobby. There are ladies present. Horace, I'll need some help here. -Come on, Bobby. -No, let go of me, goddamn-- Oh! Bobby. You drunken bastard. You're drunk as much as I am. Isn't it sad? He's so gentlemanly, too, when he's sober. I hope your brother gets his eyes opened by this. Preachin' doesn't do a bit of good, you know, but, uh, sometimes when they actually see something like this happenin'... No. -Come on. -No! -No! -Come on, Bobby. Come on. No, goddamn it! Goddamn it. Elizabeth, I'm worried about your brother. You heard what Mr. Bobby said about him just now. Well, he was drunk, Mama. He didn't know what he was sayin'. They've just gotten him on the bed. He fights like a wild man. Your Papa is workin' so hard, Elizabeth. Everyone calls on him when they need something done. When the bank reorganization is done, I am gonna make him go with me to Mineral Wells and we'll take the baths for a week. Please, don't ask Horace anymore about presents from his family. You know, I don't think they've ever exchanged gifts with him. He's extremely sensitive about it. I know this year he thought they would send something, because he kept goin' to the post office and lookin' for something from them. Did he send them anything? Yes, he did. He acted like he might not, because, like he said, they've never exchange gifts. And I thought he wasn't goin' to. So I went down and bought a few things without tellin' him and sent them on. And then, he bought some things and sent them on without sayin' anything to me. And Miss Virgie was in Houston last week and she saw his mother, and she said she was very confused because she'd gotten two boxes of presents. She told Miss Virgie she was worried about our bein' extravagant. She said it put her in a terrible position, because, um, his stepfather never sends anything to his people at Christmas. And she doesn't like to ask him for the money for her people at Christmastime. I think he's a very strange man. The stepfather? Yes. I don't think Horace cares too much for him. I'm sorry. They never go near him, you know? And it hurts him. I tell him it shouldn't, but it does. It would hurt me. Wouldn't it hurt you, Mr. Vaughn? I guess, but my God, he should be used to it by now. He's never had a home. Has he ever had a home? He has a home now. Oh, this isn't a home. It's a rented room. I think it's very nice. Well, that may be, but it's still a rented room. A home is something you own, that belongs to you. He has the strength of ten men. He wore me out. -Did he give him a shot? -Uh, yes, sir. [ Phone rings ] -Hey. Where's Brother? -Well, he's on his way down. He was helpin' Miss Ruth find where Mr. Bobby has all his whiskey hidden. She's afraid that when the dope wears off, he'll start to drink again, unless they can find the bottles. I'll get him for you. -Phone for you, Horace. -Thank you, Brother. Hello. Hello, Steve. -Is Bobby quiet? -He's calmer. -HORACE: Now? He wants Miss Ruth to sing the song she sang at the soldier's benefit. Is she going to? I guess so. She says she'll do anything to keep him quiet. Mr. Bobby is wrong when he says that I bet him $40 about Mr. Galbraith. I never said anything about $40. It was $2. I didn't wanna correct him, though, because drunk as he was, I knew that it would probably just start an argument. HORACE: Goodbye. Excuse me. Steve Tyler says he's, uh, comin' over to talk to me. Why does he wanna talk to you? I don't know. We'd better be getting back home, Mary. It's almost time for our dinner. -Bye, Lizzy. -Goodbye, Papa. RUTH: ♪ After the ball is over ♪ After the break of morn I'll call you, Elizabeth. -♪ After the dancers' leaving -All right, Mama. ♪ After the stars have gone -♪ Many a heart is aching -Bye, Horace! ♪ If you could read them all ♪ Many a hope that has vanished ♪ ♪ After the ball -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Bye. -Bye. Bye! I'm so glad we've all made up. Yes. That-- that was the nicest Christmas present of all. Mm-hm. I don't understand my mother or my sister. Would've thought they would have sent some kind of present to you at least, or the baby. I don't care about myself. It doesn't matter to me. Yeah, well, I wish I could say that, but it does matter to me. [ Sighs ] I'm-- I'm ashamed of myself, Elizabeth, but I felt such envy just now. I looked at your father, and I thought, I envy him, his success, his well-being, his affluence, and I envy his children having a father like that. Sending them to college. I-I-I don't understand your brother not taking advantage of an education. Sometimes I think that if I'd had someone help me get through high school and college, my whole life would be different. Well, I think you've done very well. I'm very proud of you. We've been married less than a year and you have money saved. Well, I-I'm not complaining. I know I've got a lot to be grateful for, but... ...who isn't doing well now with the war on and the world needing our cotton, and cotton selling for 40 cents a pound? I mean, if you can't do well now, when can you? Suppose the war isn't over next year, or the next, and all the unmarried men are taken, and they need more men, and they start draftin' those of us that have children. I worry how long the few dollars I've been able to save will take care of you and the baby. I mean, imagine being able to walk into the bank like your father did, and say, "Here's $50,000. Use it to save your bank." God help me, Elizabeth. God help me, I am jealous of your father. Forgive me. When I was nine years old, I... ...I had some chickens that I raised as pets. They were the-- the only pets I ever had. And I loved them. They used to eat out of my hands when I fed them and follow me around the yard like-- like dogs do their owners. Mama had a boarding house then, and on Christmas of my ninth year, she had no money to feed her boys, so without telling me, she went out back and killed the chickens for their Christmas dinner. When I found out, I became ill. Had a raging fever for a week. Mama says the illness was never diagnosed. When I see her now, well, she's-- she's all smiles and honey. She doesn't know the pain, or the unhappiness, or the bitterness that she's caused me. Sometimes when I'm around her, I have to get up and walk out of the room to keep from tellin' her. I'm no orphan, but I think of myself as an orphan, belonging to no one but you. I intend to have everything I didn't have before: a house of my own, some land, a yard. And in that yard, I will have growing things: fig trees, and pear trees, and peach trees. Some chickens. And I do believe I might now have all these things because you married me. I said to myself-- Before we were married, I said to myself, "She will never marry you. No matter how much she loves you, her father will stop us. He's a powerful man. And he will prevail as he does in all ways." But he didn't stop us. You did marry me. And I tell you, I have begun to know happiness for the first time in my life. I adore you. I worship you. And... I thank you for marrying me. Horace? Yes, Steve? Was my father here earlier? Yes, he was. Did he, uh, give you a present? A Christmas present? Well, yes he did. Was it money? -Yes. -My God. Well, it seems the day before yesterday, he had taken out $15,000 in one-hundred dollar bills and had told the teller it was for Christmas presents for his colored friends, and Daddy said you were one of 'em. [ Chuckles ] And the tellers said, "I didn't think Horace Robedaux was colored," and he said that Daddy said, "Well, he's not, but he's my cousin." Teller said he thought, of course, that he wasn't makin' a great deal of sense. Oh, thank you. You don't know where else he went to? No, I don't. -Merry Christmas to you both. -Merry Christmas to you. [ Hums a tune ] ♪ That made me love Mary ♪ The rose who... [ Knock on door ] -Good morning. -Morning! I-I'm takin' a walk uptown. Do you need anything? -Not today, thank you. -Oh. I hope I'll get a letter today from Mrs. Pate or Mr. Bobby from Galveston. I sure hope Mr. Bobby sticks with that Keeley Cure. I haven't heard a word yet. I hope they're all right. Well, no news is good news, they say. -Bye. -Bye. Good mornin', Henry. Oh, good mornin', Ned. You know where Horace is? -No, I don't. -I wonder if he's sick. Oh, I don't believe so. I think Elizabeth would've told us if he was sick. -You wanna buy something? -No. Got a bill I wanna collect. Is it a large bill? No, no. He always manages to pay his bill on time, regardless of what they are. Well, I'm certainly pleased to hear that. [ Chuckles ] Is Mr. Horace not back yet? Uh, no. Hm. Come to get a suit for Easter? No, I'm just here to collect a bill. Hm. Is that so? I come to spend some money with him, and you come to take some money from him. Hm. [ Chuckles ] -Good morning, Horace. -Morning, Steve. Papa's upstairs in his room. -Thank you. -All right. Come in, son. How are you this morning? Pretty well, thank you. Hasn't this rain been something? Mm. Terrible for the cotton. What's it like today? Oh, it's, uh-- it's very pleasant. May we have nice weather for Easter for a change. Easter Bunny gonna be nice to you this year? [ Laughing ] I sure-- I sure hope so. Son, I called you over 'cause I want you to go to your family for me, and I want you to ask their forgiveness. I've done 'em a grave injustice. How's that, Cousin George? 'Cause I was in love with your Aunt Mary, and she was in love with me, and I broke her heart. How is your Aunt Mary? Why, Cousin George, Aunt Mary's dead. Has been dead for 12 years. I thought you knew that. Where is she buried? Out in West Texas. Where in West Texas? Bandero. I wanna go there right away. Where's Steve? Well, he's-- he's out in the gallery. Will you go? Please. Won't you go out there, tell Steve to go to the bank right away, get some money for my trip? Did you hear from Mr. Bobby? Oh, just his mother. -She sent a card. -Oh. Um, "Everything well here. Hope all is well there. Isabel Pate and son Bobby." See? Oh, and it's a pretty picture of the Galveston boardwalk. Have you ever been to Galveston? -Oh, yes. A number of times. -Oh. I have two aunts that live there. -My father's sisters. -Yes, of course. I love Galveston. Well, I've never been there. I hope to go someday. In the summer, they have excursions that leave from here at five in the mornin', get you to Galveston at eight, and then, bring you back at ten that very same evenin'. My aunts live near the beach. They have a wonderful house. Did it last through that 1900 storm? -Yes, it did. -Mm-hm. Well, then, it'll last though anything. Was there anything worse than that 1900 storm? Well, it must've been terrible, but I really don't remember it. Oh. [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] Oh! I almost forgot, I saw your father uptown, and he asked me to give this to you. -Thank you. -Mm-hm. [ Courthouse bell rings sounds ] -Is that the time? Good Lord. -I'm afraid so. I have not made my bed yet. I'm glad I've had no callers. [ Children laughing ] Papa! Papa, where you goin'? [ Sighs ] Mr. George? -Elizabeth. -Yes, sir? What you reading? Holland's Magazine. Interestin' stories? Well, I think so. I'm not lookin' at the stories, I'm-- I'm lookin' at the house plans. -Elizabeth? -Yes? I can't go uptown. Could you call Horace and tell him to meet me here in an hour or so? All right. Holland's Magazine. Magazine of the South. -You subscribe? -Yes, sir. Horace gave me a subscription for Christmas. You recommend that I subscribe? I think you might enjoy it. I subscribe to National Geographic. I always planned to travel, but I've gone no place. You have a good recipe for Dixie biscuits? Well, I think my mother has one. Would you ask her for it, please? I asked my wife... Hey! ...to fix some Dixie biscuits for me this morning. She said she didn't know how. Can you believe that? I come from a family of cooks, you know. My mother was a great cook, my grandmother even better. You a good cook? Well, I hope to be. Uh, we-- we don't have a kitchen here. We take our meals out. I'm goin' down to the river for a swim. Will you join me? No, thank you. Never go down there without a gun. Alligators down there. [ Phone rings ] Poisonous snakes. Coral snakes, moccasins, cottonmouths. [ Phone rings ] Yes? He was just here lookin' for you. He's gone down to the river. [ Whoops, laughs ] Mr. George Tyler's off again. I know. He was just here. Whoo! [ Panting ] [ Gunshot ] Ah! [ Gunshots ] Ha. Ha. Well, Mr. Galbraith walked away a free man. He's not free. He got a suspended sentence. Yes, ma'am, but he didn't go to jail. I wonder if Mr. Bobby collected the $40 from your brother. I don't know. Brother claims the bet was only for two. Ah! Papa! Papa! -I think I see him over there. -Where? Back yonder. Mr. George! We know you're there, Mr. George. Now, why don't you answer us? Papa, it's Steve. Can you hear me? Where's Horace Robedaux? He's right here beside me. We've come to take you home now, Papa. Horace. Yes, sir. I want you take me to Bandero. I wanna visit Mary's grave. Yes, sir. Is there a train from here to Bandero? I guess so. Well, would you please find out? -Yes, sir. -You go on home now. But tell him you're finding out about the train. -Horace! -Yes, sir. Did you find out about the train to Bandero? Not yet. Well, hurry and find out. Yes, sir. Papa? Papa, come on out now. Did you hear what I said? [ Ruth singing a wordless tune ] Papa? Ruth Amos is learning a new song. Mama said she did so well at the soldier's benefit, she's learning a new one in case she's asked to sing again. Look here, Bessie. Do you like this house? Yes, I do. I got a note today from Papa sayin' Mama wanted to give me a house and to call him about it. And I did. And he said she had in mind a house costin' $4,000, which is exactly what this house costs. Bessie, I'm a nervous wreck. I want a house so badly to bring the baby to. But I don't wanna cross Horace, and I don't know how Horace will feel about takin' something like this from Mama and Papa. Did you find your cousin George? Yes. He's hiding in the woods. He wants me to take him to Bandero. I don't know how Cousin Sarah would take his visiting Aunt Mary's grave. This is from Mama. All she does, poor thing, is apologize for not having gotten us anything for Christmas. Well, this came early this afternoon. I called Papa. I told him you'd saved almost enough money to buy us a house. He said to tell you could take that money and use it to buy war bonds. You think he believed I had enough money saved for a house? Why shouldn't he? Did you tell him you'd accept his gift? No. I thanked him, but I said I would have to talk it over with you first. He said to tell you it was a gift from Mama and not from him. If you take it, the deed will be in your name. I don't want anyone around here insinuating that I married you for a house. -Well, who would say that? -Everyone. Well, I won't take it, honey, if you don't want me to. Where is the house to be? Right behind theirs. Well, I don't mind you accepting it if you make it clear it is to be in your name and no part of it to belong to me. But it will always be your home. I hope you'll always be able to think of it as your home. Well, I'm sure I will. I just want everyone to understand who the gift was for. -They meant it for us both. -No, I don't think so. It says very clearly here in the note that, uh, your mother wishes to give you a house. Horace, please, don't be sensitive. Our lives will be miserable if you are. Look, I'm not. Believe me. If-- if it had been offered to both of us, I would insist it be in your name. Horace. Hello, Cousin George. This your wife? Well, yes, sir. You know Elizabeth. Mr. Henry Vaughn's oldest daughter. Did you find out about the train to Bandero? Oh, yes, sir. Uh, there's none. None at all? No, sir. Not from here. -It's in the middle of nowhere. -Man! It's all right. Too tired to go anyway. About to fall over, I'm so tired. Been walkin' through the river bottoms. This your girl? Oh, no, sir. She lives down the street. Just a neighbor. -Who she belong to? -The Stillmans. This your house? Oh, no, sir. This is Mrs. Pate's house. Where is Mrs. Pate? I'd like to say hello to her. Well, she's not a home. She's, uh, over in Galveston with Mr. Bobby. He's, uh-- he's taking the Keeley Cure. Oh. Was he drinking again? Well, yes, sir. Ah, that's too bad. Daddy drinks, son. Yes, sir. -Killed him. -Yes, sir. How's your mother? She's well. Father sent for me just before he died. -I ever tell you this? -No, sir. Yeah. He said, "George, I'm gonna die. Promise me you'll look after my children. Promise me you'll never let them go hungry." Well, didn't keep my promise. I'm sorry. Didn't keep my promise about a lot of things. You say Mary's dead. Yes, sir. They won't let me die. I wanna die. They've been chasin' me all through the river bottoms. They give me no peace. First they wanna kill me. My own wife tried to poison me. And then, when I wanna take my own life, they do all in their power to stop me. I've had a difficult life since I betrayed Mary. I've had no happiness. I've been punished unmercifully for what I done. -You know the way to my home? -Yes, sir. Will you take me there? I'm very confused. -Tried to get there twice. -Yes, sir. How old was Mary when she died? She was 40. She had long, blonde hair when I last saw her. Did she when she died? I believe so. I married her cousin from Kentucky. Now, what the hell's her name? Sarah. Sarah, yeah. Sarah. Are you the son I had by Mary? No, sir. Where's the son I had by Mary? I don't believe you had one by Mary, sir. -I didn't? -No, sir. -I have children. -Oh, yes, sir. You've got four. Mary ever have children? No, she didn't. Poor Mary, dyin' without children. [ Sighs ] They think I'm crazy, you know. I do get terrible headaches. I can't think then. But I wouldn't harm anybody. Once I tried to kill Sarah. I didn't mean it. I don't know what I did. Took a butcher knife on Christmas Eve, chased her all around the house. Yow! I'm glad I didn't kill her. I'd have been sorry if I had. I need help, but nobody here can help me. Gonna go out there now. And I want you to go with me, son. I want you to tell 'em for me I need help. And if I can't get it, I want them to kill me. 'Cause I don't wanna go on like this. You tell 'em that for me? Yes, sir. I will. Let's go. Can you see them, Bessie? Yes, ma'am. They're on the porch. Are they talkin' together? Were you scared of him, Mary? I don't know. It all happened so quickly. Was that Mr. George I saw with Horace? Yes, sir. What is it, Lizzie? You're trembling. Is Horace in danger? No, sir. I don't think so. Oh, Papa. Mr. George Tyler is so pitiful. He doesn't even know who his own wife is half the time. You love your husband, don't you? Yes, I do. Mary, I'm goin' home. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Bessie. I wonder how he got past the sheriff and the others in the bottom and got in here. He told Horace he wanted to get back home. All he wants to do is talk about Horace's Aunt Mary. -Were they in love, Papa? -Oh, God knows. That must have been 30 years ago at least. Anyway, he's had four children by poor Miss Sarah. I expect she wanted to go running through the river bottoms many a time. These the plans for the new house? I got your brother's mid-term report card today from college. It's just terrible. I've never seen such grades. What am I gonna do with him? You say you can get this built for $4,000? Yes, sir. You mind if I take it with me and study it some? No, sir. You have a chance to speak to Horace? Yes, sir. He says it's all right with him as long as the house is-- is put in my name. He doesn't want anyone here thinking he is taking help from you. I think he's awfully sensitive. He still thinks that you don't like him, Papa. Oh, I like him all right, Elizabeth. Give me time. These things take time. I sometimes think I should take your brother out of college, put him on one of the farms. Let him learn how difficult it is for an uneducated man to earn a living. I was determined not to raise him as a rich man's son. But he has no ambition. None. And I hate to say this about my own child, but he's a terrible liar. You know that bet with Bobby Pate that he says was for $2 and still swears it was? Well, Bobby was right. It was for $40. There were four reliable witnesses that heard him make that bet. So, I sent Bobby a check for $40 today. Well, maybe that's a mistake. Maybe if he had to pay back that money himself-- Where's he gonna get $40 goin' to A&M College? No. I paid it. And I'll see to it that he works around the house, around the farm, until I'm paid back. You know I'm not a very sociable man. It isn't just with Horace. I don't have an easy time talking with my own son. Yes, sir. You see, Horace's father died when he was 12. Well, I was 12 when my father died. I went to work soon after. I put myself through college. I realize that, Papa. I haven't stopped working for a second, since I was 12. I resented Horace, I resented him very much, coming into my home-- But I'll get over it. Time heals all that. Oh, honey, I'm so glad you're back. I was worryin'. Did he go on home? I don't know. I only walked halfway with him when Steve and the sheriff drove up. And Steve got out of the car and came over to us, told Cousin George he was gonna take him home. I didn't think Cousin George would go at first, but finally, he did, and got in the car and drove away. I don't know where they'll take him. Oh. You know, it all happened so quickly, I forgot to tell Steve what Cousin George asked me to about his needing help. My God, you don't have to tell anybody that. He's needed help for years. Who could help him? I showed Papa the-- the plans for the house. Uh, he's taking them home with him to study them. By tomorrow or the next day, I'll drive you out and show you where your two lots are to be and your new road. I'll show you where I think you should plant some trees. Lizzie. Where you goin'? I'm going to get you something for your headache. No, I'll get it myself. You rest now. You've had a rough mornin'. No, I'm goin' with you. Want to be sure what you're givin' me. Might be trying to poison me. You can do a great deal on two lots. You can have all the trees that you want. And you can have chickens. I can feel the baby movin'. Can you feel it? Oh. Yes. When I was three years old, my baby sister Jenny died with diphtheria. Mama was pregnant then, and they had her in bed restin', and Papa's sisters from Brazoria came to stay with us. And one of them took me in her arms and showed me Jenny in her coffin, and I got hysterical. I fought to get away, and I raised such a commotion Papa ran in, and his sister told him he had an unnatural child... ...that refused to look at her own dead sister. Mama doesn't even have a picture of Jenny any longer where you can see it. It's hidden away at the bottom of her cedar chest. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. [ Groans ] Papa? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa? When I was five and Laura was two, I told her I wanted to show her where our dead sister was. And Mr. Billy Lee, a friend of Papa's, saw us walkin' down the road, and he asked where we were goin'. And I said, "Lookin' for our dead sister." And he said, "You can't find her." And I said, "Why not?" And he said, "Because she's not there, she's in heaven." And I said, "No, she's not. She's shut up in a box and buried in a graveyard." And he took us both, and he put us on his horse, and he took us out to the graveyard, and we found her little grave with that lamb on it. He said, "She's not in there. She's in heaven." And I said, "Who's in there, then?" And he said, "No one." "Well," I said, "How did she get out of there?" And he said, "God took her home with Him." Mary! Mary! What is it, Bessie? Mr. George Tyler. Mr. George Tyler got away from them when they were takin' him out of the car. He started runnin' back towards the river, and then, he stopped. [ Gasps for breath ] -What? Did they catch him? -No, sir. He took out a knife and stabbed himself before they could get to him. Oh, my God! He was dead by the time they got to him. And I saw Mr. Bobby down there, too. He's drunk. Mama said that he slipped away from his mother in Galveston and got drunk and came on back here. Mrs. Pate's comin' home tonight on the 11:00 train. Well, I better get over, see if I can be of any help to Sarah. Well, what about your supper? Well, I'll get something uptown. You go on and have something by yourself. Horace! Come back! Don't leave me! -Did he hear you? -No. Do you want me to go fetch him back? No. I told Mama about Miss Mary being buried in Bandero, Texas, and she said it was Junction as near as she could remember. She says it's just as desolate out there. Do you think they'll bury him out there next to Miss Mary? I doubt it. Will they bury him here? I don't know. Aren't you gonna go out and get your supper? No. Not tonight. I'm not hungry now. Are you mad at Horace 'cause he went off without you? No. You're upset about something, though, aren't you? Yes. Mr. George Tyler, I can't believe he was just here, and now... You'll be married a year on Valentine's Day. Are you glad you married Horace? Yes, I am. Do you love him now as much as when you first married him? Yes, I do. Do you think in 25 years you'll still love him as much as you do now? Yes. Do you think he'll still love you as much then? Oh, I hope so. -More? -More. What about in 50 years? Do you think you'll still love each other then? If you're still alive. You could both be dead in 50 years. How old will you be when you've been married for 50 years? Seventy-four. And Horace? Seventy-seven. You'll have gray hair then unless you dye it. Yes. And my baby will be 49. And you'll have grandchildren. And maybe even great-grandchildren. What's the matter? I don't wanna get old, Bessie. And I don't want Horace to get old. I want everything to stay just as it is. When I'm 74, Mama and Papa will be dead, unless they live to be 100, and I don't want anybody I love to die. Not Horace... Not Mama, not Papa. Not my brother, not my sisters, and not the baby I'm gonna have. What about me? Do you want me to die? Oh, no, I don't. I don't want you ever to die. [ Courthouse bell sounds ] [ Sighs ] [ Sobs ] I'm sorry, uh, ladies, for not knockin'. I forgot this room was rented. This used to be the parlor. [ Chuckles ] I, uh-- I had a lovely time in Galveston. It was-- it was a little cool for bathing, but on sunny days, we sat on the boardwalk and enjoyed the sunshine. My mother sends her regards. [ Chuckles ] -Oh, hello, Horace. -Hello, Bobby. Hey, did you hear about Mr. George Tyler? He took a knife and he stabbed himself in the heart. You were kin to Mr. George, weren't you? Yes, by marriage. Bessie, I-I passed your mother. She said you were to come on home. Yes, sir. I, uh-- I wanna show you good people a check that I got today. It's for $40. It's from Mr. Henry Vaughn, and it's in payment for-- We know all about that, Bobby. We know all about that. [ Miss Ruth faintly singing ] When Miss Ruth, uh, sang at the soldier's benefit, they announced her as the Songbird of the South. Did you go to Miss Sarah's? Yes. Steve said there wasn't anything I could do. He said they have had Cousin Sarah under sedation ever since Mr. George ran away. He said she wouldn't see anybody. Sheriff said Cousin George wasn't quite dead when he got to him. He said he had asked for me. He said he had promised my daddy he'd look out for me. [ Knock on door ] -You heard about Mr. George? -Yes. It's just terrible, isn't it? Yes, it is. It's terrible. It's terrible. Terrible. I brought some books over I thought you should have, Horace. Some volumes of Bulwer-Lytton and Thackery, Wilkie Collins. They belonged to your father, I believe. He had his name written in 'em. I got them years before from Senator Dockery. I said to my wife the other night, "I... I think Horace should have them." Oh, well, thank you, sir. Elizabeth says you think I don't like you. Papa, I never said he told me that. I only said I felt he felt that way. Well, I do like you. And I respect you, and-- Well, I hear you've been over to the bank about a loan for opening a store. Yes, sir, but, uh, I won't need their help now. I can use the money I have been saving to buy a house. Well, I don't want you to spend all the money you save. Now, let me loan you the money to help you get started, and you can take whatever you have saved and buy liberty bonds. That way you'll be helping your country, too. I can let you have the money for your business, no interest at all, and you can pay me back whenever it's convenient. Well, yes sir, thank you, sir. I appreciate it, but I can't accept it. Well, I want to help. You've done enough for us already. Thank you, sir, but, uh, I can't let you. -Well, if you change your mind. -Thank you. You know, I think an unhappy marriage is the worst thing in the world. I'm happily married, thank God, and I trust you will be. Like I said to Mrs. Vaughn when Elizabeth asked about marrying you, I said-- Well, um, that's all water over the dam, isn't it? All water over the dam. Everyone says to me, "Poor Horace. Never had a father." Well, like I told Elizabeth, I never had a father either. And now, I have no son. I'll hate myself tomorrow for saying this, but God forgive me, I have no son at all. He's a stranger to me. I don't know which way to turn. There's peace in this room and contentment. That's why I like to come here, I think. I said to Mrs. Vaughn the other night, "They don't have much, but they're contented. You feel that." I hope you find contentment in your new home. I'd buy that for you if I could, but things like that can't be bought. Uh, Miss Ruth's in her room, cryin'. And I asked her what was wrong, she said her heart was broke. Do you think I should go see about it? Oh, I don't know. I-- I explained to Miss Ruth, uh, that I was still married to a lovely girl in the sight of God. Elizabeth, I, uh-- Oh. Excuse me. I didn't know you had guests. Come in, Miss Ruth. I'm not staying long. Mrs. Vaughn is coming in on a Houston train. -Oh, oh. -Sit down. Uh, it's, uh, too bad about Mr. George, isn't it? Oh, yes. Oh, I just heard about your new house. Uh, did you hear about their new house, Mr. Bobby? Uh, well, they'll be leavin' us soon. Well, we'll miss Horace and Elizabeth, won't we, Mr. Bobby? They had to elope to get married, you know? Uh, Elizabeth's mother and father-- That's all in the past now, Mr. Bobby. Everybody has forgiven everybody now. Papa is givin' us this lovely new house. Oh, that's nice to hear. I'm always happy when things turn out well. When did you all forgive each other? Last Christmas. Oh, in this very room. Uh, how long have you been married? It will be a year Valentine's Day. They're, uh-- they're a very happy couple. Uh, you know, I-I remarked to Mama the other day, I said, uh, "I believe that's one marriage that'll take." I remember the day Horace eloped. It was Easter. Easter Sunday. No, no, Mr. Bobby. It was Valentine's Day. Ah. Y'all have a family, uh, plot reserved at the graveyard? I told Mama the other night, "We don't have a family plot. We have to get one, 'cause I want us together even in death." Miss Ruth, uh, here's the house we're giving the children. We hope to have it ready soon after their new baby is born. Mr. Billy Lee was by my office this afternoon, Elizabeth. He was remembering the time he found you and Laura lookin' for the graveyard to see Jenny's grave. This is gonna be lovely. [ Laughs ] Hey. Mr. Billy Lee's oldest boy was a sissy. He had a lovely singin' voice, though. It was very high. A tenor. Uh, he dresses up in girls' clothes. Mr. Billy says he whips the devil out of him every time he catches him doin' it, but he can't break him. [ Laughs ] Jenny would've been 22 if she had lived. Twenty-three. Her birthday was last week. Jenny was frail from the start. You were always healthy, Elizabeth. Well, that's how it goes. One lives and one dies. That Valentine's Day, uh, the whole town was excited. Everyplace you went, that's all they talked about was Horace and Elizabeth eloping. It, uh-- it was romantic. It was a warm and lovely day. You remember? No, Mr. Bobby. It was cold and windy. ♪ Oh, promise me BOBBY: Was it a large wedding? ELIZABETH: No. Just Allie, and Hector, and the Baptist preacher-- And I was there. I sang "Oh Promise Me" as they walked across the room to face the preacher. [ Chuckles ] Betty Norton carried a few roses we had picked in Allie's yard. I began to cry in the middle of the ceremony, and I think Horace thought I was sorry we were marryin'. Why were you cryin'? I don't know. What kind of flowers did you say the Norton girl carried at your wedding? Roses. Your Mama planted sweetheart roses last fall next to Jenny's grave. She planted a red rose by Jenny's grave and a pink one by Daisy's. RUTH: Have any of you heard when Mr. George Tyler's funeral will be? I'm sure it won't be for a few days. He's got relatives all over the state, and, uh, they'll wanna be sure to give them time to get here. Mama saw Mr. Billy Lee whip Edgar once. [ Laughs ] She was over to Mr. Lee's visitin' one day. Mr. Billy came home and she-- she heard him say, "Take that dress off." And then, she said Edgar, he ran across the front yard in his sister's dress, and Mr. Billy, he ran after him. He, uh-- he caught him halfway across the front yard, and he, uh- he had, uh, his buggy-- Whip. [ Laughs ] He beat him. She thought he'd kill him. [ Laughs ] She said Mrs. Lee-- Mrs. Lee just sat there talkin' like nothin' had happened. You know, I think I am gonna rent me a house of my own. I am tired of tryin' to live in that one little room. I hope to have all kinds of roses growin' in our yard after our house is built. Red roses, yellow roses, pink roses, sweetheart roses, and climbin' roses. ♪ Oh, promise me ♪ That someday you and I ♪ Will take our love together to some sky ♪ ♪ Where we can be alone and faith renewed ♪ ♪ And find the hollows where those flowers grew ♪ My Mama was, uh, an aristocrat, you know? ♪ Those first sweet violets of early spring ♪ Her-- her daddy had millions, you know? ♪ That come in whispers Uh, they were blue blood. ♪ Trill us both and sing ♪ Of love unspeakable ♪ That is to be ♪ Oh, promise me ♪ Oh, promise me
