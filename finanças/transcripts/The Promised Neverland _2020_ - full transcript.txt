Nice to meet you, Emma Wake up, everyone! Rise and shine! It's morning Get dressed I'll tie your hair Hand me the mirror Today will be the last day I'll be tying your hair When I grow up, I want to be just like Mom I see Demon! Catch us if you can! You won't fool me today OK! Done Sorry, Emma! Phil! Run! Grace Field House Orphanage None of us are related But... Morning! This House is our house Our happy home So full of energy, Emma Even before breakfast! How old are you anyway? 5? 15! Same as you No way - You're shorter than me, Ray - And you're a giant Shut up, Shorty! Morning, Emma Come help me Morning, Mom A loving Mom and lots of brothers and sisters Thank you for our food My precious family Hans, moustache Look this way. Got it That was so hard! - I got only half right - Half is good! I have your results Norman, Ray, Emma You got 300 points again! Perfect scores! We study really hard Let's play! And we play hard, too Hide and seek, anyone? Norman is "it"! Grrr! Run, everyone! No one can go outside the orphanage grounds That's the rule Phil Don't go near the fence It's dangerous out there OK... Caught you He caught me. The fence was scary He caught you already? He caught you, too If anyone can outwit the genius Norman... it's those two - Ow... - Norman! Are you OK? Caught you, Emma No fair! - It's called strategy - Strategy? Know your enemy You suck! Emma! We can't stay here forever Bye, everyone By the time we turn 16, we're paired with foster parents and venture out into the world We'll meet again Take care, Connie I hope you like your new family Thank you, Emma We thought a wonderful future was waiting for us Bye-bye Take care! But this House... was a world of lies We only have one more year in this House If you go first, write me Of course But no one ever does They probably forget all about Grace Field House The world outside must be amazing But Emma... I'll write I promise Hey Connie forgot her bunny! Maybe you can catch her The light was still on at the gate Let's take it to her! It's late. We'll get in trouble And the gate is off-limits But it's Connie's precious bunny OK. We'll get in trouble together Connie? Did you hear something? My mouth is watering... Human meat is the best Too good for us, though The human meat produced here is Grade A, reserved for the rich Another 6 year old We were hoping for something better Start preparing the top three for delivery Will do Wait a minute... I smell something Emma! Are you OK? It can't be... That can't be Mom And that wasn't Connie That was Connie... We have to get out of here I don't know what the outside world is like, but we can escape We can't... We can. You and I can We can't leave the others! But we'll all be killed! I don't want any more of them to be killed Do you think it's impossible? No, it's not It's OK. We'll all escape together Get rid of it Let's go Did you get it to Connie? It was too late We exist only to be eaten... Grace Field House isn't an orphanage It's a farm Good morning, Emma Morning Emma Good morning Mom... Mom is... Our Mom... ...works for the demons She's keeping an eye on us The fence isn't there to protect us It's to keep us in This, too We're meat That's why no one who left here has written to us Let's see what lies beyond A wall So tall You and I could climb it with a rope But what about the others? We have to think of a way Until then, don't tell anyone what we saw last night Not even Ray? Think he'll believe us? That we're meat and Mom is our keeper? Mom... Is she really one of them? She lied to us What's wrong? Oh, no We were playing in the forest and lost Naila I see Everyone wait here, OK? Mom! Thank goodness! Are you OK? - Good - You're not hurt? Let's go home, everyone She found Naila way too quickly That was no watch Are there transmitter chips embedded in us? Could it be this? This nodule? We all have them Since we're meat, chips in the ear make the most sense She let us see the watch to show us we're being tracked It was a message for us A declaration of war Norman, can you help? - What? - I can't reach When I grow up, I want to be just like Mom You look pale, Emma You don't have a fever It's nothing, Mom! Really? Connie said she wanted to be a mom just like you I know I'm sure Connie will make a lovely mom when she grows up Emma Did you go to the gate with someone last night? Dinner's ready, Mom OK Mom I didn't go to the gate It's against the rules Well, fine then For the first time, I lied to Mom There! We can use it as a rope Now, how do we get everyone out? I think we should talk to Ray What are you guys whispering about? Ray?! Sorry, I followed you guys Ever since the night you went to the gate, you've been acting weird What are you hiding? Demons? Mom is the enemy? It's hard to believe, but... I believe it Unlike you, Norman would never make up such a stupid lie - What the... - Calm down So when? The three of us could escape... No! Connie will be the last one to suffer such a terrible end We'll take everyone Even the little ones Are you crazy? Escaping isn't the end If the world is inhabited by demons, there's nowhere for humans to live Even if we took them, we'd all die But... Let's leave them It's the only way! - No! - Huh? We'll make one then A world that we can live in! Let's change the world! With our own hands Norman... You too? Come on, Ray! Let's do it! Let's escape together! First, you need to know your enemy But how? Stupid I think they're after our brains Well-developed brains are a delicacy They make us study to enrich our brains We're harvested from age 6 and delivered by age 16 The demon mentioned the top three That's Emma, Ray and me We play to win But we have to do something about these chips It's too risky to destroy them now We'll do that when we escape How do we destroy them? This size and shape... I have an idea Leave it with me, all right? Really? Yeah If you say so, Ray Look! Look! Look what I found! These owls are all a bit different Phil! Good eye! Yup! These books were all donated by Minerva Minerva's books are all over the room Wait. Is this... Morse code? Morse code? Doubt? This one says RUN Run away? And... I think this may be a roadmap to guide us - Based on what? - Instinct! If this message was really meant for us... We have an ally out there named Minerva Come, children! Let me introduce Sister Krone She's here to help me I'll be living with you from today Let's be friends! She's onto us We have even more eyes watching us now The next delivery date should be 45 days from now We have to think of a plan by then But everyone believes in Mom Can they face the truth? And how would we take everyone? Some of them aren't very athletic They'd only slow us down I have an idea I've heard so much about you Top producer of Grade A meat I'm honored to work under someone with your reputation Data on my precious children Memorize it here, now Yes... Hide and seek? We'll train while we play I'll teach them how to move You and Ray teach them how to think Mom won't suspect if we're playing But why was I called? They found out And saw the cargo Then they must be delivered! No need! It's fine We'll just keep an eye on them until their delivery date You're not going to report it? No I will deal with my children how I see fit You don't have to think Just keep an eye on them Is that clear, Sister Krone? Yes, Ma'am Isabella Emma! Have a nice day Thank you! Team Norman is "it" Hide, everyone! One, two, three, four... Run! Move your arms! Lift your legs! Higher! OK, let's go! Leave footprints Leave the twig here Thoma, it's a decoy Let's go! Ready? You can do it Over here Done - Footprints - OK, this way! No, that's a decoy - Don't fall for it - You're so smart, Norman This is the right way Let's go! Hide and seek is a game of strategy What would your enemy do? Sounds like fun Can I join you? What do you mean? I want to be your friend Can you run? Of course I'll catch all of you! Know your enemy, right? You have 20 minutes I'll be "it" Everyone run away One, two, three, four... I'll find out what Isabella's after and drag her from her throne Run! Gotcha! Come on Gotcha! And you - Let's lose her! - Stop! Gotcha! Wait! Now for the top three specimens Emma, come out wherever you are! If you saw the cargo then I would be your ally Found you! Two more How many minutes? 8 minutes 40 You can do it Damn! Too slow! Where? Why can't I catch them? 20 minutes is up. We win, Sister These aren't ordinary specimens You don't have to know why Everything is under control You don't have to do anything I'm just watching them for you So how was Hide and Seek? What do you think of my children? They're very gifted... and special Right So you understand You're very smart Don't stray from the path You may go Neither Mom nor Sister have tried anything since the game They don't care if we know the secret, as long as we don't escape There are other eyes on us We have a spy in our midst. A child A kid can get closer to us without raising suspicion Wait! Who? They're all good kids They'd never betray us They may be feeding her information without even knowing it No... It could also be an older kid What now? We still have to tell the others the truth Even if one of them is a spy? We'll start with Don and Gilda Is this a joke? Mom is a breeder? Our kind, loving Mom? Don! Stop talking nonsense! Connie eaten by demons? That's crazy! - Calm down - Meat? We're family! Brothers and sisters! All imposters Shut up! Stop! You may not believe us but it's true Trust us! Let's escape together! Did you see it? What happened to Connie? I believe you Emma, you love Mom so much You wouldn't lie We're family, right? Gilda... I'm glad they believe us When should we tell the others? Before we do, we have to find out who the spy is I set a trap A trap? I told them where we hid the rope I told Don it's under my bed and Gilda that it's in the attic If one of those ropes goes missing, we'll know who the spy is Morning, Emma Norman You couldn't sleep? No I was trying to find a way to help I see If we find out who the spy is, would you leave them behind? Of course, I'd take them Even if they lied to us? Even if they were a spy, we all grew up together Even if they betray us, I'll believe them to the end You're right Norman What about the rope? The one under my bed is gone So Don is the spy No Ray, it's you Sorry I lied to you I told Don a different place What? The trap was set for three Don, Gilda and Ray I guess I screwed up That's right. I'm Mom's spy No... Who'd be the best candidate? Who better than Ray to influence our plan? I'm helping Mom control the kids I'm a device to guide them toward her goal A sheepdog that herds the sheep But why? I volunteered I found out the secret of Grace Field House Let's make a deal A deal? Under two conditions I'd work for her if she held off on my delivery And I wanted compensation for results Compensation? I just wanted junk I ordered some things that we can't get in here But you didn't tell Mom where the rope really was That's right! You planned this escape If you were 100% loyal to Mom you wouldn't do that Is that right, Ray? Yeah... It was all for this moment To prepare for the escape! Ray... I've been preparing ever since I found out their secret So no one would notice... I tricked Connie and hid her Little Bunny so you would go to the gate So you two wouldn't get killed! What about destroying the chips? I've seen them. And tested them I swear I can disable the chips You tested them on someone? You didn't sacrifice them, did you? It must've been hard You kept it to yourself through so many deliveries But don't shut us out anymore You're not alone anymore Let's all go to the world outside Ray, you're our wild card We can keep Mom in the dark You're a double agent Double agent! That sounds so cool! - Are you stupid? - Hey! Don't call me stupid! Sorry Let's make the rope Come on! We can use this to disable the chips The final parts arrive tomorrow Emma is too naïve If we really want to escape, it's got to be the three of us and maybe Don and Gilda Emma won't go for it So trick her! Pretend we're taking everyone but only escape with kids over 14 - I can't - Why not? We can't take everyone, and you know it! It was the first time That night was the first time I saw Emma cry I thought she was crying because she was scared to die. Like me But I was wrong She was scared her brothers and sisters were going to die Even then, she was thinking about saving everyone She's awesome And I thought I want her to smile I want Emma to keep smiling Because I love her As a family member, of course Don't look at me like that I want to be like her. Like Emma To believe and never give up She can make the impossible possible I never thought you'd be such a useless watchdog So I sold out my best friends And I’m reporting on Sister, too If only they hadn't seen Connie... Anything to report? Norman is trying to kill you And? He's collecting detergent and weed killer To poison me We need to switch out the contents Do you know where it is? Will you help me? We'll take care of it That's it Oh, yes You'll be the first to know I received notice yesterday No deliveries next month So the next delivery? Will be in January. Your birthday So I'm next I got the detergent and weed killer We'll need to do a trial run You're going to the wall? Emma and I will climb over and check it out What about the chip? Ray will make sure they don't check them I'll stop Mom Gilda and Don keep tabs on Sister - How? - How? How will you stop me? So you're Ma'am's targets after all Wanna join forces? I want to escape, too. From this hell I have a chip embedded here One step off the farm and an electrical shock will stop my heart I can only live here So... I may as well live the best life possible within these grounds, In the best farm surrounded by the best kids I'll be the best Mom Do you know where? Right here! I'm going to drag Isabella down and be the new Mom here If you escape, Isabella will be removed Our escape will help your cause? So let's work together The enemy is Ma'am Isabella You came from Grace Field too... Not from this Plant, though I'll tell you everything you want to know Come to my room tonight once you've made your decision Welcome! Sister wants proof so she can have us delivered She'll pretend to collude with us Then we won't trust her or give her any proof But we'll get the information we need Come in What do you want to know? What about the outside world? Unfortunately, I've never seen it But there are humans out there When and why did the demons appear? Long ago, there was a war Between demons that hunted humans and humans that killed demons Tired of the constant battle, demons and humans made a promise Promise? To live in separate worlds Demons wouldn't hunt humans and humans wouldn't kill demons Humans left some of their kind in the demon world and went to live on their own The humans left behind were domesticated by the demons and bred as meat Thus, this farm You're being bred to be eaten What about security here? Not a problem Very few security guards They don't even patrol the grounds Because these chips will give away our positions? You knew about them? This Mom showed us Know where they're planted? Where? In your ears I see. Thank you Let's go That's it? So you already know? How to destroy the chips Words are telling But so is an attitude, a look, a blink of an eye... I told you the chips were in your ears, but you never tried to touch them Why? Because you knew How to destroy them! How do you destroy them? With some sort of tool? Did you... create something? You did, didn't you? I see... She still doesn't have proof Let's go You made something? Come again! Once I have proof they'll be delivered immediately And that woman will be finished What fun I'll be the new Mom! Your reward. As promised Thanks. I only have two months left It'll be a nice memento Yes By the way, Sister approached us again I guess she didn't heed my warning See you tomorrow It's almost time Look this way Smile What's that? Show us! Wow! Let's take a picture - OK, I'll take it - No, I will! - No, I will - Go ahead Come on, everyone! Let's all get in the picture Mom! Sister, too! OK! Say Cheese! Ready? The camera was the last part I needed to destroy the chip We need to do a trial run today Once that's done, we're ready to escape Ray, Emma, Norman. Smile! Ready? Show me Let's do laundry I hate laundry It's showtime! That's for the chip? Where should we hide it? Sorry, Phil. I need Piggy OK She already looked here Emma! We're in trouble! My Piggy! Oh Is the proof in here? What's inside? I hear some rattling Wonder what it is? Shall I open it? Sister Krone From headquarters. Open it Me? The new Mom of Plant 4? Sorry to see you go Pack your things and return to headquarters immediately Grandma's waiting at the gate Right now? Good-bye I won't let her have her way... Grandma... Some children from Plant 3 know our secret The top three are planning an escape! But the situation is under control, right? If it's under control, it's not a problem - But the rules...! - Once... I also had a situation And I created the very gifted Mama Isabella She's very special And so is her Plant You will not... replace her She won Escape... You brats! Thank you for our food Be on the lookout If Ray needs help with Mom, let us know OK! Let's switch out the chemicals Yes Sister Krone I got rid of her I didn't need her anymore Same for you I'll take over from here What... Wait a minute! Wait! Huh? What? No signal from Ray, but Mom is... Something happened Don... I'm going to check! Damn! - Ow! - Sorry What's going on? We have to stop Mom! What's wrong, Mom? 14 years... We've lived together But this is the first time we can speak plainly Pleased to meet you, Emma, Norman I'm talking to you as your breeder Don't take it the wrong way I love you So I'm here to urge you to give up Give up? Give up what? Resisting You live in this nice warm house, wanting for nothing and die feeling fulfilled What's wrong with that? You can't escape Your fate is decided for you I want the five of you to be happy Go, Norman! Emma! It's OK. It's just a little boo-boo You just broke your leg I have to protect my gifted children at all costs You're stuck here now And tomorrow will come Tomorrow? Congratulate him, Emma I just received word Congratulations, Norman You have a delivery date We need to talk Norman, you should escape tomorrow Sorry, I can't - You have to - You have to Listen to me Pretend like you're escaping tomorrow but hide until Emma's leg is better Then we'll escape together If I escape, one of you may be delivered I don't want either of you to die in my place Thanks But I'm starting to accept it Accept it? They can have my life! But I won't give them anything else! I'll win! Our plan will succeed! That's enough for me Norman... It's fine No, it's not fine! I've been planning your escape for 9 years! Even if you escape, they won't deliver Emma while she's injured If anyone gets delivered, it'll be me. So go! I got it! Then break your legs, too! Isn't that a great idea? Let's all break our legs What are you saying? We won't be Grade A anymore You're right! Let's do it There's no guarantee that an injury will postpone a delivery Then we'll catch a bad cold! They won't eat sick meat You're both crazy No, we're not It's better than watching you die You said we should all escape together You have to be with us It's OK We'll all escape together And live together Norman Hey When did you find out the secret? I have memories from the womb Normal people lose their memories from infancy It's called infantile amnesia Memories start at 3 - 4 years old But not me I remember everything from before I came here Do you remember your mother's face? No... How about the outside world? When I was at headquarters Headquarters? The first place I saw after I came out of my mother's womb There were demons and humans and lots of other babies Then I was brought here So I know we can't escape through the gate It's connected to headquarters This will disarm the chip Put it next to your left ear and flip the switch Thanks... Don and Gilda are making a new rope So you disappear tomorrow We'll escape once Emma's leg heals OK... We won't let Norman die We'll all get out alive! What's this? Good news, everyone What? We found a foster family for Norman He's leaving tonight - Tonight? - He's leaving? - Yes - It's sad... But congratulations, Norman Congratulations Anna, Sherry Thanks, everyone Write to us Bye See you Let's go Emma Don't push yourself I'll bring you more later Thanks Take care, Norman Let's escape together See you It'll be fine Everything will be OK Come, children! What's happening? Let me help you Oh, where's Norman? Norman Everyone's here. Hurry! Why? What's going on? I checked it out I climbed the wall There's a cliff on the other side It's too high to jump And I walked along the wall This is Plant 3, where we are And this is headquarters The only bridge is here We have to cross the bridge Norman, Mom's calling you Tell her I'll be right there OK Here you go. I didn't use it Use it when you escape You were planning to return all along! Sorry, Ray My escape would complicate things I can't afford to make a mistake I won't let anyone else die I did all that I could Escape at all costs Thanks for everything I had a good life, thanks to you two It was fun I was happy I had a good life Damn... Damn! Let's escape now. Together! I've made up my mind Understand? Bye Take care, everyone Take care, Norman Thanks Eat all your food Thanks I don't want to understand Norman! I'll keep Mom distracted So escape Idiot! That's not what you're supposed to do! Shut up! I won't let you go! Emma Please understand No! I can never accept that You want to live... Don't you? It's fine, Emma That's enough for me I can go with a smile It's time, Norman I know you'll miss him There was nothing you could do Don't make a fuss Come on Take care of Emma and Ray I'll write, as I promised You'll read my letters, right Emma? Don't worry Never give up Emma... You did the right thing Now Emma and Ray will live In this house? Happily? Yes, they'll lead a happy life Are you happy, Mom? Yes. Because I met you Wait here, then Did I surprise you? Are you Minerva? You know that name? Minerva has... been disposed of Then who are you? I maintain order in this world You mean the promise between demons and human? Oh, so you know That means you're on the demons' side Actually, I serve the humans Demons can only derive intelligence by eating human brains So the smarter you are, the better Thank you Thanks to you, many humans lead peaceful, oblivious lives On their behalf, I thank you Do we have any allies in the human world? You do There are humans who want to save you all from becoming meat I see But... They disappear It's my job to seek them out and crush them It sounds nice But they're all imposters Sacrifices must be made in order to keep this world intact Disillusioned? No There are humans out there who are trying to save us Many of them And even if crushed, they reappear Right? That alone gives me hope Does it? Yes You're an interesting one There's hope. The world can change They'll change it for us Take it. Go if you want I can't anymore Poor thing Norman is dead and Ray is useless You can't do it alone Escape is impossible now The best way to end your despair is to give up Don't resist it. Accept it You see, Emma, I'm thinking of recommending you to be the next Mom of this farm You can't change the world So live your life to the fullest within this world Become a Mom and forget everything else No... Emma Checkmate Ray, tomorrow is your birthday So is my delivery date Tonight is our last night together Right... I guess it's good-bye Farewell Have you really given up? You haven't, have you Emma? No, I haven't You too? Yeah We're on the same page Let's escape, Ray That's what I came to talk about We haven't been able to talk for the past two months Mom is sharp Her eyes are on us even if we're not doing anything So I took advantage of that I distracted her and left the preparations to Gilda and Don Ready? Go! Everyone's training Tools, food, everything is ready We're ready to escape tomorrow at noon No... Security is tight during the day I have a better idea We set fire to the House tonight! Start a fire? Move! We'll escape while Mom's putting it out They'll think we evacuated, not escaped Security will be light and we can escape over the bridge What if Mom chooses to save us over putting out the fire? Don't underestimate her I know... So I'll stop her myself! Ray? It's perfect! Her Grade A specimen will go up in flames! She'd never let that happen! I decided this long ago I don't really like studying or reading But I did it I tried my best to bring up my scores! To enhance my value! I'm going to take that away from her Right before the delivery date They won't eat me I won't let them! Food? Product? Who cares? I'm a human being! The joke's on them! Ray! You have to survive, Emma Bye-bye Ray! Ray! Emma! Help, Mom! Ray's in there! Ray...? What have you done? - Mom! - Take everyone outside! Get back, Emma! I can't put it out Emma! You escape too! Emma? What were they wearing? - Here she is! - It's Emma I'm here! Let's go! - Here, Emma - Thanks Let's go! Let's go, Ray Norman was onto you Emma! A message from Norman Don't die here. Come with us, and I'll show you something great Sorry, but we won't let you die Emma? Me, Norman and the kids would never let you die Emma, here it is! Thanks! Change into these Your dummy Now the chip Sit down and I'll extract it It's starting, Norman Dear Emma, This is the rest of the plan Execute it the night before Ray's birthday I couldn't forget what Ray said So you two wouldn't get killed Ray didn't count himself And he was saving petrol Ray plans to set a fire and die Let's go! Let's use his plan to trick Mom and help everyone escape All according to Norman's plan! Do they all know the secret? I told them everything Checkmate We have something to tell you It's very important What? I see That was part of Norman's plan too What about the little ones? We're leaving the kids under 4 here But I haven't given up on them I talked to Phil I can wait So leave me behind I promise we'll be back before your delivery date They got me But they're still alive! Emma and Ray! No one will escape! Mom! Phil? Where's Emma? I'm scared, Mom! It's fine You'll be OK I'll be right back so wait for me here No, don’t go! This is 73584 at Plant 3 There's been an escape! The alarm! Close down the bridge The alarm Earlier than expected Salvage the Grade A specimens But I want all their heads intact What now? The bridge is too far! It's OK We never intended to cross the bridge They think we'll escape over the bridge Not the cliff. So that's where we'll go Let's move! I found a place to cross It's risky but you can do it Here We'll cross here! Don Cross... here? Yes! Don! I'll go first! I'm counting on you Did it! Nice, Don - Let's go! - We're next! Ready, go! OK! Everyone get ready Give me your hand Hold it tight Ray! I'll go first Isn't he scared? Let's go Alicia. Yvette Ready? How hard did they train? Ray! This is what Norman said he'd show you Something great Norman, is it OK if I'm still alive? Of course, Ray Don't give up Can you do it, Sherry? Ready? You can do it! To believe and never give up She can make the impossible possible They're not at the bridge? It can't be... You're next, Jemima But Emma, my hands Sorry. What if I fall? Listen, Jemima It's OK We'll cross together Tie us together with the rope OK! Done Let's go Jemima You can do it! Ready? OK! Now Emma... Mom... Wait, Emma! I never thought I'd be standing here again I stood here when I was your age A boy named Leslie was killed on his 16th birthday I loved Leslie When I learned the truth, I escaped and stood in this very spot And I knew... The steep cliff The dark forest There was nowhere out there for me to live I gave up and aspired to become a Mom I was ordered to bear children I sang to my unborn baby a lullaby that Leslie wrote A song only Leslie and I knew What happened to that child? He died at birth I clearly remember the day when I held you in my arms I wanted to be the best Mom in the world I would love my children more than anyone I'd make every year special for them There's nowhere out there for you to live You can't change the world We'll make one, then! A world that we can live in Emma I don't know what's out there I may not be able to make it alone But... I'm not alone I'm going with everyone to the world outside! If you jump, I'll cut the rope Go ahead I don't care, if that's what you want I'll go anyway You don't understand I do! I know you raised me this way To read the enemy You taught me that Checkmate To have faith in my family You raised me to be strong and healthy It was all you To produce a prime specimen Is that all? You wanted to raise children that would surpass this place No You want to change the world, too No You want to see us grow up too, right? No! Good-bye Mom Let's go Go I hope your future is full of light Ray Where did you hear that? In my mom's stomach I have memories from the womb Do you know the song, too? No I found out the secret of Grace Field House Mom! It's Mom It's Mom, everyone Children I'm sorry, children Respond, 73584 Are you OK? Are you OK? Don't cry, Sherry Look It's Norman He's smiling Look, everyone Norman left us this pen Minerva's owl... It flew away! Let's go! I take full responsibility We're outside! The morning sun... What do you see, Emma?
