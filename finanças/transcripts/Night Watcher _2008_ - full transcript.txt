LOOK. WE'RE GONNA GO SMOKE. WANT TO COME? UM, NO, THANKS. WE'LL BE BACK. SHE'S PROBABLY JUST IN THE CAR. YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, MIKE, I SWEAR TO GOD. LISTEN, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. NOTHING HAPPENED. SHE JUST GOT MAD. - OH, SHE GOT MAD? GOT? - YEAH, GOT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER. YOU'RE APOLOGIZING. - FINE, WHATEVER. - YOU GUYS... IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS OUT HERE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME KINDS OF EXPERIENCES, WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SAME KIND OF FEELINGS. IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO RELATE TO PEOPLE ABOUT A SUICIDE IN THE FAMILY. SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND. THERE ARE SOME FEELINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN YOUR VERY BEST FRIENDS, ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO RELATE TO. WELL, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF NEW PEOPLE HERE TODAY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE OF THEM COULDN'T QUITE MAKE IT. SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE... ONE NEW LINK IN OUR CHAIN. WHAT WE USUALLY DO WHEN WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER IS A SELF-INTRODUCTORY TYPE OF THING. OKAY. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. UM... MY NAME IS ANGELA. HI, ANGELA. Angela: AND... I GUESS THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE... HI. ARE YOU BRIAN? YEAH. CONTINUE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS? WHAT? OH, NO. I DO IT SOMETIMES TO SAVE MONEY ON GAS. OH. I USED TO ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I HATED IT. IT MADE ME REALLY ANXIOUS, YOU KNOW? I FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA MISS MY STOP. I ALWAYS GOT NERVOUS THAT I WAS GONNA MISS MY STOP. IT'S REALLY STRESSFUL. BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE IT'S-THE-LEAST-I-CAN-DO SORT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW... RIDING THE BUS, THAT IS. WHY WERE YOU LATE? MISSED THE BUS. NO, YOU DIDN'T. I JUST WAS, I GUESS. MY NAME IS BRIAN. I KNEW THAT ALREADY. OH, YEAH. YOU'RE ANGELA. I KNEW THAT ALREADY ALSO. WHO WAS IT? MY DAD. YOU? MY MOM. I'M SORRY. WELL, GOOD LUCK ON THE BUS, ANGELA. DON'T GET LOST, OKAY? THANK YOU SO MUCH. I GUESS I'll SEE YOU NEXT TIME? I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING BACK AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT. YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO EITHER. REALLY? NO. - WELL... - I MEAN, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. WELL, DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR SORROWS ELSEWHERE THEN? LIKE WHERE? LIKE ONLINE? NO, DEFINITELY NOT ONLINE. WELL, NOT LIKE A DATE, RIGHT? JUST OUT. ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE? NO. ARE YOU? I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU IF I WERE, RIGHT? - HEY, BRENT. - MORNING, ANGELA. HOW'S THE SECURITY BUSINESS? SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. THANKS FOR HELPING US OUT, IAN. THAT'S REALLY GREAT OF YOU. ANGELA, HI. HI, MR. LOPES. I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU HAD CLASS OR SOMETHING. NO, I'M JUST HERE FOR YOU. OH, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SO SPECIAL. NO, I MEAN I SCHEDULED THIS MEETING WITH YOU BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU. I KNOW. I'M TRYING TO GET... DO YOU WORK? NO, I DON'T. JUST TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, ANGELA, YOU'RE NOT GONNA PASS THIS CLASS THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING. IT'S NOT THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK. YOU'RE NOT TOO STUPID FOR THIS CLASS. IT'S JUST THAT YOU DON'T TURN ANYTHING IN. AT THE SAME TIME, I CAN'T CUT YOU ANY SLACK BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME A REASON TO CUT YOU ANY SLACK, YOU KNOW? I... I DON'T KNOW. I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S JUST... MY GOD. UM... MY MOTHER DIED REALLY RECENTLY. UM... SHE WASN'T OLD OR ANYTHING. SHE... KILLED HERSELF. AND, YOU KNOW, MY DAD'S, LIKE, NOT IN MY LIFE. WE'RE SORT OF NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS. I'M SORRY. IT'S OKAY. I CAN SYMPATHIZE. I LOST MY DAUGHTER BETH RECENTLY. SHE HAD TONSILLITIS, YOU KNOW, WHICH USUALLY ISN'T VERY SERIOUS, BUT THINGS JUST KIND OF... THEY WENT WRONG. AND SHE... SHE LEFT US. AND SHE WAS NINE... NINE YEARS OLD. IT WAS REALLY HARD. I'M SO SORRY. SO I CAN UNDERS... I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE REALLY REALLY HARD. WELL... I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU, OKAY? I GUESS I CAN CUT YOU A LITTLE SLACK NOW. COME HERE. - BAD? - NO, IT'S ANNOYING. - WHAT DID YOU GET? - B-MINUS, WHICH IS SO STUPID. I HATE THAT GUY. IF I HAD TO FIND A NEW ROOMMATE, I WOULD NEVER PUT UP ONE OF THESE ADS. THEY'RE SO WEIRD. AREN'T THEY WEIRD, ANGE? UM, I WOULD NEVER ANSWER ONE. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WEIRD. WELL, THE REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T ANSWER ONE IS 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO WEIRD. I GUESS. PEOPLE PUT SOME CRAZY STUFF UP HERE. OH MY GOD. WHAT? YOUR MESSAGE. I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY GOT THAT. NO. I KNOW. IT'S SO SAD. GOD, WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AT THE BEACH. IT'S HARD TO TELL WITH KATHERINE, THOUGH, YOU KNOW? HEY. HOW WAS WORK? HOW WAS WORK? FUCKING AMAZING. HOW WAS SITTING ALONE IN THE APARTMENT? ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT I DID TODAY? I BOUGHT CIGARETTES AND WENT TO THE BANK. DID YOU ROB THE BANK? NO. PITY. I'M GONNA GO CHANGE. YOU GOT SOMETHING TODAY. THERE'S NO ADDRESS ON IT. SOMEONE MUST HAVE, LIKE, DROPPED IT OFF OR SOMETHING. I JUST HEARD. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OH, HONEY, WHAT IS IT? HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW... THERE'S STATISTICS... EVERYWHERE. I KNOW. MORE PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES THAN EACH OTHER. THERE'S MORE SUICIDES THAN HOMICIDES. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, ANGELA? YOU CAN'T BE ALONE. YOU'RE SAFER LIVING WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER THAN WITH YOURSELF. YOU CAN'T RUN FROM YOURSELF, THOUGH. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT. ANGELA, WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M SORRY, GARRETT... I MEAN, MR. LOPES. I CAN'T REALLY STAY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I JUST... I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GET MY... I MEAN, MAYBE, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GET YOUR INTRO PARAGRAPH IN ON TIME. THINGS ARE HAPPENING. WELL, THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW, ANGELA. SURE, YEAH. I MEAN, I'll JUST TRY AND EMAIL IT TO YOU WHEN I GET A CHANCE OR SOMETHING... SOON, I MEAN. JUST GET IT TO ME WHEN YOU CAN. THANKS. I NEVER KNOW IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR THE CHECK OR GO UP TO THE FRONT. I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. OH, WELL, YEAH. BUT I MEAN AT PLACES LIKE THIS, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. CHECK, PLEASE. WHAT? YOU GO ON LOTS OF DATES, DON'T YOU? YOU DON'T? WELL, NO. LET'S JUST SAY FOR THE SAKE OF, I DON'T KNOW... SAY THAT... OKAY, LET'S SAY... THAT YOU WERE ON A DATE RIGHT NOW. - RIGHT THIS MOMENT? - RIGHT THIS MOMENT. - WITH YOU? - WITH ME OR ANYONE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. OKAY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO RIGHT NOW? WELL, HMM. I WOULD PROBABLY TRY TO GET TO KNOW YOU OR HER, SO I MIGHT ASK, I DON'T KNOW... - WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE...? - CHINESE. I THOUGHT IT WASN'T YOU. WHAT'S YOURS? ITALIAN. WELL, THEY HAD PASTA. I DON'T LIKE PASTA. BUT YOUR FAVORITE FOOD'S ITALIAN? THAT'S WEIRD. NO, THAT'S AN INTERESTING FACT ABOUT ME... A FACT THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU THINK THAT I AM A UNIQUE AND INTERESTING PERSON. AND YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON HERE THAT KNOWS THAT ABOUT ME AT THIS VERY MOMENT. AND THAT IS WHAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU LIKE ME. OKAY, YOUR TURN. OKAY. UM, LET'S SEE... OH, MY MOM AND I USED TO SEND MESSAGES IN A BOTTLE, LIKE, ALL THE TIME. WHAT WERE THE MESSAGES? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T REMEMBER. I WISH I DID. DID YOU PUT YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION ON THEM? SHUT UP. YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF MY INTERESTING FACT. DO YOU STILL DO IT... I MEAN, SEND A MESSAGE? NO, AFTER MY MOM DIED I JUST GOT SO MAD AT HER THAT I NEVER WENT BACK TO THE BEACH. IT'S LIKE IT CHEATED ME OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW? MAYBE IF YOU FORGAVE HER... I DON'T WANT TO. YOU SHOULD. IT'S BETTER. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? CAN I ASK THAT? SHE SLIT HER THROAT. OH MY GOD. WOW. YEAH, I KNOW. IN THE KITCHEN. I FOUND HER. I'M SORRY. WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD? HE PUT HIS HEAD IN THE OVEN. I DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY DID THAT. ME NEITHER. DID SHE LEAVE A NOTE? NO. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, YOU KNOW. DOCTORS ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE. MY DAD WAS A DOCTOR AT HUNTER GENERAL. SAME WITH MY MOM. MAYBE THEY KNEW EACH OTHER. - THERE MUST BE SOMETHING OFF, YOU KNOW? - WHAT? THEY DID IT AT THE SAME TIME, BOTH DOCTORS. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S THE HOSPITAL. THAT PLACE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO THEM. - MAYBE IF WE WENT... - NO NO. YEAH, LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL. MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING OUT. I CAN'T GO THERE. I CAN'T GO TO THE PLACES WHERE SHE'S BEEN. I CAN'T TOUCH THE THINGS THAT SHE'S TOUCHED. I CAN'T. IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING, DO YOU PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE? WHO WOULD I TELL? SERIOUSLY. OF COURSE. I MEAN, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. IT'S JUST... WHAT? I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING. WELL, YOU SHOULD TELL ME. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU THEN I'M MAKING IT A BIG DEAL. AND IF I DON'T TELL YOU IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED. SO JUST FORGET IT. YOU SHOULD TELL ME. NO. FINE. DON'T. YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU KNOW. WHAT? SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE AND THEN NOT TELL ME. PROVOCATIVE? YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THEN WILL YOU TELL ME? I GUESS SO. WHAT? I GOT... I GOT THIS TAPE. OF YOUR DAD? - YEAH. - ME TOO, OF MY MOM. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHY WOULD SOMEBODY VIDEOTAPE OUR PARENTS? WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT? I DON'T KNOW. ANGELA, I THINK... I THINK MAYBE MY DAD DIDN'T... LIKE, MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE DID. WHAT? COME ON, LIKE SOMEBODY KILLED HIM? IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME ANY OTHER WAY. I GUESS I'M JUST CONFUSED, YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE... MAYBE SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO HELP US. LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA BE FINE, OKAY? I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST SAID THAT.

HE'S A SECURITY GUARD. WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE? JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE. OKAY, SO HOW LONG DO WE HAVE? AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS. WE HAVE TO DO THIS, OKAY? THERE'S NO BETTER TIME.

WHERE CAN WE GO? FIND SOMEONE. AND TELL THEM THAT WE HAVE MY DEAD NEIGHBOR IN THE TRUNK WITH A GUN? IF WE GET BACK ON THE ROAD, HE'LL KILLS US. WE'RE NOT ANY SAFER IF WE STAY HERE. YEAH, BUT... IF I LEAVE IT'S LIKE I NEVER FORGAVE HER FOR DYING. I CAN'T DO THAT. OKAY. THE MOON'S BIG TONIGHT. I CAN'T TELL IF IT'S FULL. I NEVER CAN. I THINK IT IS. IT'S USUALLY FOGGY. YOU CAN'T SEE THE MOON MOST NIGHTS. YOU CAME HERE AT NIGHT? WE WENT ALL THE TIME. EVEN NOW... I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M GLAD I MET YOU. I'M GLAD I MET YOU TOO. - ANGELA. - MM? IT'S MORNING.

MY LIFE WAS DESTROYED BECAUSE OF TWO FUCKING PEOPLE. - I'M SORRY. - SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SEE, THAT'S WHY I DID IT THIS WAY... TO KEEP YOU SAFE, YOU KNOW, SO NOBODY WOULD EVER KNOW. THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO GUESS AND MAKE UP LITTLE STORIES ABOUT WHY THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR PARENTS HATED THEIR LIVES. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU. AND WHAT DID MY DAUGHTER DO? YOU ARE TOO STUPID FOR THIS CLASS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU DID. IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOUR PARENTS DID. THEY DESTROYED MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE. AND NOW I'M GONNA DESTROY YOURS. NO. NO. I'VE TAKEN EVERYONE YOU LOVE. AND NOW I'M GONNA TAKE YOU. NO. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NORMAL PROCEDURE, ANGELA. SO COULDN'T YOUR PARENTS HAVE DONE THEIR JOBS?
