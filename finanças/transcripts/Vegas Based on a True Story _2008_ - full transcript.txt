He's not gonna get a new bike for his birthday if he keeps doing this. I'll talk to him. Well, at least he watered it. Yeah you know, that water's costin' us. Didn't you see the last water bill? We're wasting money on all this grass, Tracy. TRACY: It's worth it. I'm gonna get some tomatoes for dinner. BLONDE MAN: You know you could buy tomatoes at the market. I can't believe you said that to me. My tomatoes are better, and they taste better than the market tomatoes, and they're better for you. BLONDE MAN: I don't know, I mean, a tomato's a tomato. Take your shoes off in the house. Hello babies. Boy, that's a big one. Look at this, you are growing so nicely. (TOILET FLUSHING) Eddie, the light. MITCH: Hey mom, look. What is it?

You never answered my question. EDDIE: I'll take you surfing one day, buddy. TRACY: You know we can't afford it. Can you help me set the table please? (HISSING) (METAL CLANGING) Alright man, I'm outta here. Dude, man, you leavin' already? It's like five o'clock, come on. What? You gonna tell Harry? I thought you could close up for me, okay. Well uh, I'm meetin' Frisco at The Nugget. Oh man. Listen, it ain't my turn to close, Eddie. EDDIE: I've been doing this shift jobs all week, Bennie. And you owe Frisco and me money all week too, okay? You know, there's like eight people who work here. Someone else could close. Yeah but, you know the rules, Eddie. - He who owes, - He who owes, - has got to close. - got to close. - Alright. - Okay thanks, I gotta change. (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) (WATER SPLASHING) (NOSE BLOWING) (GAME DINGING) (LEVER CLICKING) (GAME DINGING) (SIREN WAILING IN BACKGROUND) EDDIE: That's strange. Has he been there since you came home from school? MITCH: Yeah, he's just been sittin' there. Did that guy say anything to you? MITCH: No, he just was sittin' there. Alright, stay here. Eddie, just don't do anything crazy. Can I help you, pal? I'm not really sure. My name is Brian Watson, United States Marines. EDDIE: That supposed to mean somethin' to me? Listen, I know this might seem strange. Yeah it's strange, you're sittin' here staring at my family in your car. I'm sorry. My family and I used to live in this house. I grew up here. Our house? This exact house. Except, it didn't have a backyard then, it was all desert. I didn't mean to startle you folks. Everything's just been a blur since my father's funeral, and... Oh, I'm sorry. One minute I'm in Baghdad burying a friend, and the next I'm in San Diego, burying my father. When I first got here, I called my mother and told her where I was. She asked before I leave that I take a photo of the last place my family was together, and happy. I have a camera in my vehicle, if I may. EDDIE: Yeah, yeah go get it. Thank you. (CAMERA CLICKING) Your family moved to San Diego from Vegas, why did they move there? Well, in actuality it could've been any city. We just had to get away from the casinos, and uh, see, my dad kinda got sucked in, and he wouldn't quit gambling while we were there so, mom gave him the ultimatum, and California looked good. Did it work? He quit gambling, if that's what you're asking. But San Diego wasn't home, not like Vegas. You were stationed in Iraq, right? BRIAN: Yep. Did you ever have to shoot anybody? Mitch, don't ask someone that kinda question. That's okay, Tracy. But Mitch, your mother is right. You should never ask a soldier that question. Is there anything I can help with? No, you're fine. Thank you. Brian, is there any way I could get a picture with you? BRIAN: Of course, if it's alright with your parents. I guess it's okay. EDDIE: Boss says okay, it's okay. TRACY: One, two, three. (CAMERA CLICKING) (LAUGHS) That's great. What do you think about Brian? Cool guy. A little sad. I know, his father dies and... Yeah. His friend died. Think we'll ever get that photo from him? Yeah, I think so. Seems likes an honest guy. (HISSING) (METAL CLANKING) (MACHINE HUMMING) BRIAN: Ooh, okay, don't tell your mom I hit the plant. TRACY: Is that Brian? EDDIE: Yeah, I don't know any other Marines. MITCH: Hey mom, look what Brian got me. BRIAN: Mr. Parker, Mrs. Parker. TRACY: It's cute. Brian, you didn't have to go and do that. BRIAN: I wanted to do something nice before I left. EDDIE: I don't know, I think he's just here for some of your meatloaf. (LAUGHING) When did Brian get here? MITCH: I don't know, when I was watering the grass. Take your ball into your room please. No bouncing the ball in the house. Mitchell. Think about it for a day or two. Talk to your wife. I don't know. This is sorta comin' outta the blue. I understand. Think about it. I gotta get goin'. Thanks. (WIND BLOWING) (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) What did Brian want? Our house. What? Brian's mom wants to buy our house. 150 grand, cash. 150,000 dollars? Mmhmm. 150,000 is just the starting price. He wants us to name our price, come back to him with another offer. He said his mom's got money or somethin' from his dad's insurance policy. TRACY: We're not selling our home. EDDIE: Tracy... No, that's my garden out there, okay? EDDIE: I know. Our yard, we've done a lot of work here, I'm sorry. I hear you. This is our home. I hear you. Our life, Eddie. EDDIE: But 150 grand sure does sound good. I don't care, our life is not for sale. What if it's a lotta money? I don't care Eddie, no. Tracy... I sad no, Eddie. That's it, end of discussion. Mitch, come set the table. (DISHES CLATTERING) (CRUNCHING) I can't believe you just sit in here all the time. It's just comfortable for me. GIRL: Yeah. Where did you used to sleep? Right over there. Where did your parents sleep? Right over there. Yeah? Sorta small for two people, don't you think? I don't know. When I was a baby, my mom used to lay me down right here, to go to sleep, on this table. GIRL: Really? Mmhmm. GIRL: I saw your pictures the other day. You think maybe I could have one? Yeah, ask my mom that. I love that car, it's cute. Yeah, it's my dads. Which one of your parents do you like better? Steph, what are you trying to do, make me go crazy? No, I was just trying to change your mood. I should just go, sorry for bothering you. (DOOR SLAMMING) (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) Beverly, you want some more coffee? No, I'm going now. I'll be right back with your check. Thank you. Ladies, I'll be right with you, okay? Whatsup? There's a Marine out there asking about you. Where? Right out front here. Mrs. Parker. TRACY: I thought you were on your way to Iraq? I was, they extended my leave a couple days so I could help with my mother's things. How did you know where I worked? I asked down at the church. Hope I didn't surprise you by showing up. I wanted to ask if you and Eddie had discussed my offer. Yeah, we talked about it. So you came up with a price? We're not interested Brian, and that's that. I feel kinda embarrassed. Maybe you should just go find a nice realtor or something. Well my mom wants to live in the house where she raised her family. I mean, she's willing to pay for it. I wanna raise my family in my house too. But the church said you've only lived there two years. Doesn't matter if it's two years or two months, that's my house, my family. What does Eddie want? (MACHINES HUMMING) MAN WITH PONYTAIL: Eddie. Looks like you gotta new friend. Check it out. What the fuck is he doing here, man? Look, I told you already, I don't wanna sell, so just back the fuck off, okay? I don't need any more problems, Brian, I'm sorry. Hey, the last thing I wanna do is cause problems, especially for nice folks like you and your family. Good. It's my mom, she... She doesn't give up so easily. But hey, I'm sorry, and I'll leave you guys alone. I'll head out. Okay. Too bad we couldn't get that drink, huh? But, if you change your mind about selling, you can find me down at Ace's Bar. Hey! I didn't mention it earlier cause, I didn't think it'd make a difference but, mom told me to raise the offer by 30,000, just something to think about, okay? BENNIE: So what's up Eddie? That guy just upped his offer 30 grand. Do you believe that? For your house? Hey Eddie, if you get rich, don't forget your friends, man. Frisco, I don't even know who this guy is, man. He pops in my life, he's offerin' me all this money for my house. I mean if you want some information on the guy, I got this friend, a computer geek, I don't know, he can find out anything about anybody. Yeah, this guys real good man, he helped me get dirt on a neighbor friend of mine who was trying to screw me. Okay yeah, I mean... I don't know, this guy drives me crazy, I don't know what it is. Well, what's that guy's name again? Fuckin' Brian Watson. Used to live at your place, right? Yeah. Well I'm on it. Well Eddie, if he offers you a lotta money man, just take it. Yeah, I know but, Tracy... Tracy. (MACHINES HUMMING) What are you doing? I can't sleep. TRACY: Where are you going? I'm gonna watch TV. TRACY: Well don't have it up too loud, Mitch is sleeping. Okay. TRACY: Don't have a beer or cigarette. Alright, I know. Don't stay up too late. Alright. (SIREN IN THE DISTANCE) (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) No Brian Watson or Watson family ever lived in your house on 900 East Street. Plenty of Watsons lived in Las Vegas, but not on East Street, not in the last 40 years. Son of a bitch. There's more. Had Davy look up Brian's military records. Yeah. Okay, there's two Brian Watsons that went to Iraq, one of 'em, is a black guy in the Air Force. The other guy, 33 year old Marine, killed in Fallujah last year. (CAR DOOR SLAMMING) (TV SHOW CHATTER IN THE BACKGROUND) Hi. Hi, excuse me, do you know Brian Watson? I don't know a Brian Watson, but there's a Brian Smith in the back. Back here, Eddie. Take a seat. Sit down, Eddie. Your house is worth more than you think. You're Brian? How's that, Brian? You ever hear of the sands heist of '65? Gibson gang? Oh please, every kid in Vegas heard that story, we all thought the money was in our back yard. It's in someone's backyard. Las Vegas, 1965. It's a developers map. Logic says, you stick with what you know. Lloyd Pinkus woulda known where every development was gonna be put. See the address? (TV CHATTERING IN THE BACKGROUND) Well there's a million dollars in that suitcase. You find it, we can be partners. 50/50 is fine by me, Eddie. This is just a down payment. Think about it, Eddie. Do the smart thing. What would you say, if I told you that the Gibson millions were right in our yard, waiting to be dug up? TRACY: We're not digging up our yard, Eddie. I don't give a damn what that crook said to you. Think about it, Tracy, why does the guy wanna buy the house? We're not digging up the yard. Tracy, if the money's there, it's worth it. Come on, think about it. You don't know... MITCH: What money? I'm sorry Mitch, but Brian lied to you, to us. And then he told your father some ridiculous story about money being buried under the house. It's not buried under the house, it's in the yard. The house, the yard, the washing machine, I don't care, whatever. MITCH: How much money? A lot. None. MITCH: Under our yard? - No. - Yeah. Yes, yes. Why would the guy offer us all that money if it wasn't true? You know what, maybe he sells shovels or something. You know, it's just a ridiculous story, a repeated story, a story you hear all the time, over and over. Tracy, the story is true. The story, look, Mitch, you've heard of the Gibson gang, right? MITCH: Yeah, the crooks that got away with a bunch of money, but I think they spent it on hookers and blow. Mm mm. TRACY: 'Scuse me? MITCH: I mean, Russ said that, not me. TRACY: There's no money buried here, alright? (DOOR SLAMMING) EDDIE: You didn't see the photos these guys had. TRACY: Oh please, photos. I'm sure it was all documented, right? EDDIE: Come on, it could be here. The money's gotta be somewhere. TRACY: Eddie, you're nuts. You're fucking nuts! This is a fucking stupid story and I'm not gonna dig up this yard! (BREATHING RAPIDLY) (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) MITCH: Dad. (TV CLICKING) (WIND BLOWING) TRACY: Thank you, I'll let you know Ruth, thanks. I gotta run, but I just wanted to say hi. You look so good! WOMAN IN GREEN: Thank you so much. Say by the way, where's Ed? TRACY: He just didn't, you know, he just couldn't make it today. WOMAN IN GREEN: Okay. TRACY: But I'll talk to you guys later.

Okay, thanks, I'll let 'em know. Bye Mitch. Bye. You know, I don't want you talking to Stephanie or any of your friends about what's going on at home, okay? Yes. (BEEPING) Cool, a metal detector! Let me see it. No, back up, back up, it's not a toy. Mitch, move back please. Mitch, move back. MITCH: I just wanna see it. What the hell is this? EDDIE: Shhhh. Don't shush me! You've got to listen to this. It's definitely a hot spot. (BEEPING) Tracy, look at this thing! I don't care what kind of noise your stupid little toy is making, take it back. (ITEMS CRASHING) Mitch, here, take this. Go over here, sweep over there. What'd you pawn this time, Eddie, huh? Now come back over here. Mitch, don't play with the buttons. Who do we owe money to, Eddie? (BOX THUMPING) Tracy, there is something buried under our lawn. You're being thick, just listen for a second. I'm being thick? Yeah, right over here. MITCH: Yeah, come on mom. This is definitely a hot spot, Tracy. The machine goes crazy when its over here. (BEEPING) Look, we'll just dig right here, right in the hollow spot. All we gotta do is dig right here, Tracy. (BEEPING) How do you like it? - Good. - Good. (CUSTOMER CHATTER IN THE BACKGROUND) Five bucks, come on, come on. Not today. Guy over there with the hat.

I can't believe this. (BEEPING) See what you started? Well go talk to him. I'm not touchin' this. (BEEPING) You're taking it back after dinner. Honey, wanna tell me what this is all about? Huh? (BEEPING) Mitchell. I know it's crazy, but I, there has to be something buried, right here. TRACY: You know, I don't wanna get into this conversation again. Your father's taking it back after dinner, and stop using it or we're not gonna get as much money for it. MITCH: But mom. Mitch, what happened at school today? Nothing. What? Nothing happened at school today. I'm gonna work in the garden a bit. Does anybody wanna help? Mitch, you gonna sit here all night like your dog got shot, or are you gonna help your mother? Okay dad. I'll get the dishes, Tracy. Thank you. Get your jacket on please. Well I think giving them the fish oil will make them grow even better, just like the flowers, don't you think, Mitch? Hey. What's wrong? MITCH: Me and dad do every single little tiny detail that you want us to do, and all we wanna do is dig a little bit in the yard. But there's nothing here. So what if there's nothing here? Is it too terrible for us just to wanna try? I just don't want you to be disappointed, honey. We'll just dig one hole. Right there, just, and it's not even near the flowers. We won't even touch the flowers, and when we're done, we'll just fill in the hole with the dirt, and little patch of grass on, and it'll be good as new. Just one hole. Thanks mom. Yes. Just one hole, okay? It's getting late. Okay, just one hole. That's it. Get that bottle of fish oil for me please. MITCH: Okay. (ENGINE HUMMING) How much was it? EDDIE: It was nothing, I borrowed it.

That must be the handle from the suitcase the Gibson gang stole. I know it. That's it, I've had enough. Where is it? We just gotta dig a little wider, maybe a little deeper. It's gotta be right here. If we dig for like 20 minutes, we'll find it. MITCH: Yeah, come on mom, it must've been separated by erosion or ground water or something. Come on, just a few more feet. (GROUND CRUNCHING) Don't you remember what happened last night, Eddie? EDDIE: Oh please, come on, we've already started. What have we got to lose? Our house, for one. EDDIE: Tracy, if we find this suitcase, we'll buy 10 houses. That's just great. Why don't we just add that to the list? 'Cause you keep losing money. I'm tired of apologizing, Tracy. It's been two years since I gambled. Seven years since our last bad binge, and you were worse than me back then. Oh that's right, I'm not allowed to talk about how she used to gamble, but she can talk about me all she wants.

(ENGINE IGNITING) Most minerals are mined for a particular reason, some of them for gems, some of them for things we have to use. We also have this particular black one, that is used for iron. Now, we've looked at the colors. Mitch. TEACHER: Now we also see a luster. Does it shine, is it dull, does it look like a piece of metal, does it look like a piece of glass? WAITRESS: Alright, how was everything? (LAUGHING) Good, glad you enjoyed it. (WHEELBARROW BANGING) (TOOLS CLANGING) (GRUNTING) BOY IN BLACK: Hey virgin boy, get your ass out here.

(ALL SHOUTING SIMULTANEOUSLY) BOY IN BLUE PLAID: Real fuckin' scared. MITCH: I'm gonna kill you, Russ. Oh, what's the matter, huh? (LAUGHING) Is that all you can do, is call names? (GROANING) What, you need your mama to come? I guess you did grow some balls. Hey what's the matter, you know we're joking. Yeah. You're one of us. You grew up with us. Yeah, come on, same frickin' trailer park. Come on. You know we're just kiddin' with ya. Dude, come back, hang out with us. What's the matter? Fuck you. Oh come on, don't be so cold.

STEPHANIE: Okay. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Here's 12 bucks. Get me a pack of cigarettes, and a six pack and some matches, and bring me the change. Dad, I'm 12. Don't be such a pussy, Mitch. This is Las Vegas, okay? You got money, you can buy whatever you want. Where am I supposed to get a pack of cigarettes and a beer that'll sell it to me? Right, like you don't know. Go to the trailer park, talk to Russ and his pals, okay? Get me a pack of cigarettes and a six pack. Fine. Hurry up. So, what am I supposed to do about these birds? Just give 'em a little food and water, they'll be fine. I gotta go, my dad wants me to go to the store. (BIRDS CHIRPING) STEPHANIE: Can't you at least tell me their names, if you ever decided on names? MITCH: They don't have any names. Just, name 'em whatever you want. (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) (WIND BLOWING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (THUDDING) Morning mom. TRACY: Morning, who, who is that? MITCH: Who? Right there. It's not Brian, is it? No, no. Can I help you? MAN IN SUIT: Excuse me, is this the Parker residence? You know it is. DETECTIVE QUINN: Sorry Mrs. Parker, Detective Quinn, Metropolitan Police Department. May I have a word with you inside please? I'm sorry Detective Quinn. Mitch, go get your father. I'm sorry I've come so early this morning, Mrs. Parker, but I wanted to catch you before you went off to work. Did our neighbors complain about the noise? No, it has nothing to do with the noise at all, I can promise you that, okay? I don't understand. Eddie. EDDIE: Yeah. Mr. Parker, Detective Quinn, Metropolitan Police Department. Good morning, Detective. Pleasure to meet you, sir. Sorry about my appearance, I was working all last night in the yard. Is there a problem, Detective? No, it has nothing to do with any of what you guys have done. I've been looking around the house, though, and based on what I see, I'm in the right place. I see, what's that supposed to mean? It means you've met the suspect, Mr. Parker, Brian Mendel. Do you know him? I see. You familiar with Reality Gambling? TRACY: No. No? It's when people bet large sums of money on what they think other people are gonna do, whether they go shopping, whether they fight with one another, or will they dig up their yard looking for buried money. Mitch, when you made your first dig son, there was a lot of money wagered and exchanged, and Mrs. Parker, when you were researching that suitcase handle, there were a lot of bets there as well. Mr. Parker, I'm sorry to tell you, but there's no money in your yard, sir. You've been the victims of a vicious and mean scam. It's nothing to be ashamed of, but I'm gonna need statements from each one of you as to what's been going on around here the last couple of weeks. No. I'm sorry? I said no, get off my property. TRACY: Eddie. DETECTIVE QUINN: I'm just trying to help you. You wanna help me, leave. - Fine, I'll go. - Good, go. - I'll go. - You'll go. Okay, son, here's my card. Have your parents give me a call when they finally come to their senses. Mr. Parker, I'm just trying to help you, sir. Think about it. Oh I'm thinkin' real hard, Detective Quinn. Yeah! MITCH: What? Don't you see? Brian sent him 'cause he knows we're gettin' close. Eddie, he has photos of us. Anybody coulda taken these photos. MITCH: He has a badge, dad. So what, he got it at a costume shop. The guy's a fake, I knew it in the first minute. There's no money here, there's no money here! Tracy, Brian is panicking because he knows that we're close. When we were digging under the tree, that's the right spot, we know it now. (SIGHING) I gotta go to school, I'm gonna be late. Alright, see ya. Watch out for the fake cops. Detective Quinn. Wonder where they came up with that name? (DOOR SLAMMING) I don't wanna be late, don't wanna lose my job. Alright, well hopefully this is the last day you'll ever have to work. (DOOR SLAMMING) (ENGINE HUMMING) Dad. Dad! EDDIE: Get outta the way. Dad, what are you doing? We've gotta level everything out, otherwise this machine is gonna tip over. But what are you doing? Just leveling everything out so we can dig deeper everywhere. (ENGINE HUMMING) (ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN) Get outta the way. Mitch. (SEAT BELT CLANGING) Get outta the mother fuckin' way, alright? Ow, stop it! (ENGINE IGNITING) (ROCK THUDDING) (FENCE CRASHING) (BEEPING) This is the place, this is it. MITCH: What are you, dad, what are you doing? I'm taking it down. Dad, this is mom's greenhouse. You can't do that. Mitch, there's a suitcase with a million dollars under there, I'm taking it down. Get outta the way. Mom is gonna kill you if you take that down. (HEAVY BREATHING) (ENGINE IGNITING) Dad, stop, stop. EDDIE: Get outta there! (GREENHOUSE CRASHING) MITCH: Dad. Watch out, get the fuck outta the way. (CRUNCHING) (CRASHING) (WINDCHIMES CHIMING) (METAL CRASHING) Go get the flowers, now. MITCH: I'm not gonna do the flowers. What... MITCH: I'm not doing the flowers. Listen, stop being a pussy under your mother's thumb, okay? Kill those flowers. It's probably right under there. Stop it, go! (THUDDING) (DRILLING) Faster!

Dad! Hey dad, wake up. What are you doing? (MICROWAVE DINGING) Did she say where she was going? MITCH: No. She did talk about her family a lot though. How'd you get here, again? Snuck outta the hotel room last night. I left her a note, though. What'd it say? MITCH: Said I wanted to see my dad. So what, did ya hitch hike? MITCH: No I, I took some money out of mom's purse. Just enough for a bus ticket and some chips. I said I was sorry in the note. Any change? So Mitch, how come you're really back here, huh? Come on, was she with some other guy, something like that? MITCH: No, you know mom, she would never do that. Oh yeah I know mom. That's why I'm asking. Yeah, right. She'd never do that, fuck. What, what's the matter? Wanna cigarette? Turn on the TV. GAME SHOW HOST: Let's check in with Mark Saunders, our friend who was up early, but he's run into some trouble. He's now all in with pocket nines, and the flop, he gets another nine. Saunders feeling good about that, now the turn card is a ten. (POUNDING) Though Saunders will double up. You didn't just ask for a king, did you? You did! (CHEERING) (THUDDING) (DRILLING) MITCH: Hey. Hey, guess what? MITCH: What? I finally named your birds. MITCH: Really? STEPHANIE: Yeah. MITCH: What'd ya name 'em? STEPHANIE: Blue One, Blue Two, and Lady Green. (LAUGHING) MITCH: That's weird. STEPHANIE: Yeah. MITCH: So how are they doing? STEPHANIE: They're doing good. They sing a lot. My sister and my mom and my whole family are like in love with them. Do you miss them? MITCH: No, I don't miss anything these days. (CARD FLAPPING) MITCH: I need some money. RUSS: You got collateral? I got this bike. I don't want your bike, but, you can always pay me back by workin' for me sometime. MITCH: What kinda work? Just like the rest of us. Hand out nudey cards to whoever wants 'em. MITCH: Can I just have the money? I'm sure you'll pay me back once your dad digs up that fuckin' treasure. I don't wanna talk about it. Can I have the money? Alright, alright, but we're friends now. I don't wanna fuck that up, but tell me if you change your mind. I won't change my mind. But you will get your money. (CARS WHOOSHING) (GRUNTING) Hey, cigarettes. MITCH: Yeah, just one second. Okay, hurry it up. (CASE THUDDING) Hey Mitch. MITCH: Yep. EDDIE: When you're done with whatever you're doing inside, hurry up and give me a hand out here, I need you here. MITCH: Nah, I gotta lot of homework to do. I'm really behind. EDDIE: 'Scuse me? I said no, I gotta lot of homework to do, I'm really behind. EDDIE: Come here. What? Come here. Yeah? Come here. When I fucking tell you something, you fuckin' say, yes dad, you understand me? Say, yes dad. No. No more. I don't care about your stupid fuckin' money in the ground. I don't care about your Gibson Gang suitcase. Don't pay for one more penny of my stuff, okay? Just take that money and shove it up your ass. I'll get a scholarship for college or somethin'.
