Nervous because he didn't know if his audience was going to accept him. People had not seen him perform in so long. It felt like his record career was over as well. It was intense. The '68 Special, it was either the beginning or the end of his career. Tom Petty: You know, God bless him. He was a light for all of us. We all owe him for going first into battle. (Petty laughs) He had no road map, and he forged a path of what to do and what not to do. We shouldn't make the mistake of writing off a great artist by all the clatter that came later.

And it's said that his mother would tell him that if he sang when the moon was full at night, his twin brother could hear him. Priscilla: Gladys was a doting mother, but she could be quite firm as well. Always very protective of him. He was her only child. She lived for him, and... he lived for her. When Elvis was three years old in 1938, his father was sentenced to three years in prison for forging a check. The check was to buy food to put on the table. Gladys would take him to see his father. Vernon was so embarrassed. John Jackson: Thankfully, he doesn't have to spend the three years. He only spends six months in prison. But what it does is it starts a pattern of Vernon being away and Elvis and Gladys being left to their own devices. And they move around and live in different boarding houses. Schilling: This was the end of the Depression. Vernon, after that experience at Parchman Prison, he had a hard time finding jobs. Priscilla: Elvis told me that his father really lost his spirit. And his mother had to work really hard during that time. Man: Yes, that's it. (guitar playing) Ready here for the slate. 802.

"He had to dig back to find his real self, and it was like looking back into the past." (gospel music playing) (wind howling) (gospel music continuing) Red West: Vernon and Gladys heard this loud roar, half in their sleep. They picked Elvis up. Thought they were putting him out a window to get him away from the train that was coming. Threw him right into a wall, and he bounced off and fell on the floor. (laughs) His cryin' woke them up, and they saw it was no train. It was a tornado that went through Tupelo. Ferris: Southern religion reminds its believers that we're here for a short time. If you lost your life or you were spared, it was because of divine providence. The loss of life, the destruction of property, it was a reminder of the fragility of life.

It was a different culture, and a sense in which things were connected and happening, that someone like Elvis could not even imagine in Tupelo. The wealth, the affluence, the scale of buildings, the power of that river flowing by. Jackson: Memphis is a very diverse city, not an integrated city, but a very diverse city. So you had a lot of people moving there after the war. Man: ♪ Well, you know I love my baby ♪ Jackson: It was really the hub for people from that Southern cotton plantation area to either stay or use it as a stepping stone to go somewhere else. Ferris: Like many Southern families, the Presleys moved to the big city seeking a little better opportunity. Portia Maultsby: Memphis developed a very vibrant entertainment district, 'cause, you know, people brought with them their music, their culture. Petty: You've got that spill there of the blues, of gospel, pop music, country music. All those things, they cross over each other, and radio definitely had to play a big role in his influences, because I don't think he was carrying the kind of dough to have an enormous record collection. (Petty chuckles) Porter: WDIA, it was a 50,000 watt African-American radio station that artists like Bobby "Blue" Bland were being played 'cause the whole emphasis was black music. Black music was just beginning to take root in our area, and there's no doubt in mind that Elvis Presley listened to WDIA. Percy Mayfield (on radio): It's a real pleasure to invite you to keep your radio dial turned to 1070. That means WDIA. That's 50,000 watts of powered entertainment for your pleasure. (children chattering) West: We were both just above the poverty level. I lived in one housing project, and he lived in Lauderdale Courts about three or four miles away. We grew up the hard way. (children chattering) Alan Light: The apartment in Lauderdale Courts that the Presleys moved into was part of the early New Deal housing program. It was affordable, but it was bigger than anything they were used to. They gave him everything. They let him sleep in the big bedroom. They saved what little money they had so that he could buy a guitar, he could buy a record player. And they gave him that same sort of independence to go out in the city and be exposed to other musics. (jazz playing) ♪ Train I ride ♪ Priscilla: He loved the bright lights. He loved the music in the city. He loved hearing people in the street. He loved listening to music coming from the bars. And he'd study them. Porter: Elvis was a student.

When you realize that Elvis knew where Beale Street was, and knew what that all meant, you could sense that he was different. ♪ ♪ You walk in the Flamingo Room on a Saturday night or a Friday night, you're in another world.

Beale Street was the place. Porter: You'd go out on your weekend night, and you were an African-American, at that time, you're making small wages. You were in a racially prejudiced time, and you had to have an escape.

The emergence of radio, deejays, and artists. And then you add to that concoction, the genius of producers like Sam Phillips. Lauterbach: There wasn't much in the way of rhythm and blues, black music recording infrastructure. It was very much a do-it-yourself, mom-and-pop business. Maultsby: Sam Phillips loved the blues, and he was interested in recording as many blues performers as he could. Schilling: Elvis was aware of what Sam had recorded at Sun Studios. Rufus Thomas. Ike Turner. The Prisonaires. Petty: I really believe Sam Phillips, for a long time, had the idea of finding a white singer that could bring black music into the white mainstream. For a lot of noble reasons, not just commercial. Schilling: Everybody thinks that Sam was looking for a white boy to do black music. But Elvis was looking for Sam Phillips. Sam Phillips: I had seen him go by in his Crown Electric truck a number of different times, 'cause we had an open storefront. He'd go by and go back, and go by and go back. This guy would not come in the studio and ask me to audition him for nothin'. Elvis had never been in a studio.

Brought in Scotty Moore, he was working at his brother's dry cleaning plant, and Scotty played the guitar and was not afraid to experiment. Bill Black, I knew could play a good slap bass. Black was working in an appliance store repairing appliances. And I said, "Go and woodshed, boys." Scotty Moore: Sam said, "All I need is just a little background noise. "You don't have to worry about arrangements or anything. "Don't need the whole band, just a little rhythm stuff." I knew Sam was looking for something, but he couldn't tell you what he was looking for, you know? (chuckles) Phillips: This day we had wound up just about ready to give up on having any success on a session. About ready to bag up the instruments and go home. I knew Sun Records had to make it on something that was a little bit out of the ordinary or we may as well forget it. Jackson: Things aren't going well. Elvis is nervous. Moore: We'd been there two, three hours, and it was starting to get late and we were getting tired. And, uh, we stopped and had a Coke or something. Jackson: Elvis was just about a year out of high school, 19 years old. Moore: He wanted to please Sam, and he knew he had to prove himself. Robbie Robertson: It was in that moment that the world changed. (up-tempo music playing) Moore: Elvis sets his Coke down, picks up the guitar, starts just frailing, you know, fire out of it.

In fact, they went, took Elvis out of the movie he was at, and told him that, uh, that Dewey wanted to talk to him on the radio. Schilling: He came on, did the interview.

I mean, this is really taking your influences and going somewhere with them, to a place that's new. West: Now, Elvis had a hit record, and he was touring every night somewhere, each night a different place. Jorgensen: The basic mistake people make about Elvis was that he came along and got lucky.

And there's something that happens through extensive touring that you can't get anywhere else. Jackson: You look back at the calendar of his dates, and he's literally playing dates every single night. The circuit that they're working is probably one of the most thankless and low-paying, just grind-of-a-circuit that you could imagine. Springsteen: There's a depth of craft that's attained through simply constantly doing it night after night, having to satisfy all different types of audiences. West: You know, you have the stereotype of the bass being tied on top of the car. That was true. They really did that. Man: May I ask, where did you pick up your style? Elvis: My very first appearance after I started recording. I was on a show and I was scared stiff. And I came out and I was doing a fast type tune. Everybody was hollering, and I didn't know what they were hollering at. Everybody was screaming and then I came offstage, and my manager told me that they was hollering because I was wiggling my legs.

We knew in time that something this great could not be kept under a bushel. Ferris: You cannot understand Elvis apart from country music, but he was pulling it away from the traditional Grand Ole Opry sound and shaping it as a new, bluesier version.

The radio broadcasts had an enormous impact in Memphis, but the Louisiana Hayride was a whole different audience.

Ferris: That was a kind of testing of his ability to reach audiences beyond his own home in Memphis. ♪ ♪ Malone: The Louisiana Hayride did send out road tours to surrounding towns. The entire show would move. Jackson: They'd start to build these touring routes that bring them back to Shreveport once a week. That's a big turning point, not only from a financial perspective but also from a exposure perspective. Jorgensen: Elvis played a lot of these first shows with Jim Ed and Maxine Brown, Bud Deckelman, uh, Betty Amos-- successful country artists, but not on a real top level. Zanes: Those performers are competing with one another. Somebody wants to leave there feeling like they won. And being on bills like that, you are amongst people who are gonna teach you things. And that's a big part of what made Elvis in those early becoming years was that he had an antenna that was up, and he was stealing tricks, he was learning lessons. He was bringing it all in without it seeming like he was just doing somebody else's act. Fontana: He could go out there, and the audience wouldn't be on his side for maybe five minutes. But all of a sudden, somehow or another, he'd turn 'em around. Moore: He could read an audience very well. He could tell if it didn't seem like he was going or just right, he'd do something, something you wouldn't even expect. Jorgensen: He often started a song by like a wail and then left it hanging there, so people were like, "What's going on?" He would stop in the middle of a song and turn around or walk away, and then go back, or do something with a microphone stand. Schilling: And he would grab that microphone, and he would drag it across the stage. He was so sophisticated already about making contact with an audience. If the audience reacted a lot to something he did, he did it again. (distant screaming) He just had this look, like a wild, captured animal. Shook his head and his hair was down in his face, and just to watch him walk from that curtain to the microphone, you felt a part of it.

And so the indie labels took it up, and it took the major labels a while to see that rock and roll wasn't going away. Man: ♪ Now if you've got a woman ♪ Victor Linn: The RCAs, the Capitols, the Columbias, the Deccas, they were called the majors. All the other people, these were independent businessmen who sold records to stores. Phillips: I have a small record company, been in business five years, worked the lower of my anatomy off, peddling days of me on the road to the tune of 70,000 miles a year. Linn: When we say "independent," Sam was connected to no one at the major labels in any way. He would produce what he wanted to produce. ♪ Dog that bite your hand ♪ It means record it. It means edit it. They went into the lab and did the mastering. Packaging was already done, and then they put a bunch of singles in the car, and got on the road and went into the hills of Tennessee. And this is really a very traditional way of doing it. ♪ I went down to the river ♪ Linn: Now what the record company would like to see happen is they could spread that regionality, get it from northern Georgia to Alabama, and from Alabama across to Mississippi. You know, then they've got national distribution. Phillips: I knew, really, so little about the business when it came to merchandising records and this sort of thing. The main thing that did more for us than anything else was it created excitement amongst the major labels. A lot of hard work went into this thing, both on the part of Elvis and the part of Scotty, and Bill, and myself. Schilling: Elvis, when he was 19 years old, he knew what he had to do to get where he wanted to. He was a very driven man. Every two months, he was releasing another single at Sun Records. Robertson: Sam knew what to ask for, what to push for, and all of those pieces, the way they fit together, it was like Sam Phillips was the other member of that group. (train whistle blows) Springsteen: The Sun space was pretty indicative of most small recording studios of the era. You know, they were intimate. They were small. You were up close with everybody and everything. Harris: And those early records, they almost knock you off your heels, because all that big sound is coming from so little. Springsteen: I think people make the mistake that when they think of rock and roll, they think of drums. Elvis: ♪ Oh, baby, baby, baby ♪ Springsteen: If you listen to a lot of the early rock and roll, rhythm came out of the slap bass, rhythmic hitting of the guitar, and the swing of the singer's voice.

People like Hank Snow, Marty Robbins. (audience cheering) (Colonel Tom Parker speaking) (audience screaming) Mike Stoller: He knew he had something very special and he knew from the audience reaction. He promoted him. He dropped his other artists and devoted himself entirely to Elvis. Elvis: ♪ Keep my eyes on you ♪ Schilling: The Colonel, he's a very hard guy to understand. His past was complicated. I think there was a real respect between Elvis and the Colonel, but he was a promoter, he wasn't a creative guy. He was a brilliant promoter. Jorgensen: There was a big tour in February '55. Hank Snow was the headliner, and Colonel Parker had managed as a favor and a plot, to get Elvis on as an extra added thing. Being on a Hank Snow show was a real big step forward. The Colonel planned it to be a big step forward. He wanted to see how far Elvis could go. Elvis: ♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme all the love you got ♪ Jorgensen: Just three months later, they realized that the star, Hank Snow, couldn't close the show anymore. After Elvis had performed, people left. From June of '55, you know, basically a year into Elvis's stay at Sun, people are making offers to buy Elvis's contract. The Colonel was afraid that if Elvis became much more successful than he already was, that he was eventually not gonna be able to take over his management. He would be so big that he was no longer needed to bring it further. So over the next month, he actually starts manipulating everything. And after that, it became obvious between the management of Bob Neal and Sam's little independent record company, they couldn't push a record the way the big companies could. Elvis starts worrying about that element. Mae Axton: A lot of my listeners have seen you and they've heard your records, and they think they're very wonderful. And of course, you really skyrocketed to fame on "That's All right, Mama," wasn't that the one? Elvis: Well, yes, ma'am. That was the one that got me on my way and everything. I wasn't very well-known down here. I mean, you know, I'm just with a small company, and, uh, my records don't have the distribution that they should have, but, uh... Axton: Oh, of course that-- that's coming, you know. It takes a little bit of time for that and to get distribution all over the United States, but I think you are one of the fastest rising young stars perhaps in the field. Do you know what I can't understand, is how you keep that leg shaking just as-- just at... Schilling: Elvis, he knew, "I've got to make a choice." He and Sam spoke the same language creatively. And they loved each other. But he knew that Colonel Parker was about national, about movies, and about television. And that if he chose Colonel Parker, Sam would be gone. Priscilla: Sam Phillips saw in Elvis what Elvis dreamed of and no one else could understand. West: Elvis was still underage, under 21. The Colonel set up an appointment with Vernon Presley and Gladys and talked to 'em. "I'd like to buy his contract from Bob. I think he has a lot of potential." They were suspicious of everybody, and they should've been suspicious of the Colonel, but the Colonel filled 'em with all kinda hope. They said, "Well, okay." Jorgensen: In that whole scenario here, we have the Colonel locked in on the idea that he wanted RCA. Because he knew RCA from Hank Snow, and he even puts up money of his own as an opening to the dealings with RCA, which he would lose if he didn't bring in the RCA contract. He really believed in Elvis's potential.

By the time he lands at RCA, he's in charge. They're a rock and roll band, and Steve Sholes didn't know how to make one of those records. Elvis did.

He'd been out touring and playing in front of people for those months in-between. He had experience in the studio. He had had the inspiration of Sam Phillips, watching, pick the songs and the arrangements and all of that. Petty: You can hear "Heartbreak Hotel" has got echo chamber, because he's clearly asking for echo.

Nik Cohn: One of the paradoxes with Elvis is how could a boy so in love with God, so obsessively in love with his mother, so decent, and "yes, ma'am," and "yes, sir" and all of that, how could he be so unconfined on the stage?

Petty: I don't think he was, necessarily, trying to shake the world in that sense, but I think he... he knew what he was onto. He knew it made him feel great, and he knew there was a rebellious streak in it. He had to know that, and it made him powerful. They're clearly afraid of him... (Petty laughs) ...to some degree. Zanes: If you see a large social anxiety on the horizon, there's probably issues of bodies in control involved.

I don't think there was any-- any possible way to know that that was going to resonate and shake young people to their core in such a profound way. Steve Allen: The reason I booked him, I recognized right away that he had something, a cuteness. It was chiefly his face, but a beautiful sound, he really never had. Landau: The thing is that it was well-known that Steve Allen, who fancied himself a major songwriter, hated rock and roll. And his purpose in having Elvis was, first and foremost, he needed the ratings, but secondly, to be sarcastic and condescending to Elvis and to the music he openly despised.

There was something wrong there. Elvis, why are you letting him do this to you? ♪ ♪ Ferris: We can look at Elvis as a Southern trickster figure. You deal with power by yes-ing them to death, and that's what Elvis did. Very polite, very deferential, but with his eye on the sparrow. He was basically a good-natured Southern kid, but he was on a mission to deliver this music. Schilling: By 1956, Elvis was coming into his own. The RCA singles were enormous. "Hound Dog," "Don't Be Cruel." They sold three million copies. Light: When Elvis's first album came out, that sold 300,000 copies. "Heartbreak Hotel" topped all three Billboard charts: country, pop, and R&amp;B. This was now a career that was going to these unimaginable heights.

There was all kinds of pressure and all kinds of expectation. The Sullivan Show was the crown jewel, that was the biggest game in town.

Man: Can you tell us anything about the first movie that will be made? Elvis: We'll have a movie coming out, uh, we start making it in June. It's, uh... It's a movie with Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn called The Rainmaker. Schilling: He didn't get The Rainmaker. They talked him into doing Love Me Tender. And then talked him into four songs. Jorgensen: I think that Elvis brought a lot of insecurity with him. He wanted to be a movie star, that was much bigger than being a recording star, and he was fairly disheartened when he learned that he had to sing for these movies. Priscilla: In the first four movies, you see him so into the part, and you see him really taking the role seriously. He learned everyone's lines. He thought that's what an actor did. Training himself to be more like a Marlon Brando or a James Dean or a Humphrey Bogart. He respected these actors very much, and this is where he thought his future was going. Landau: The movie people took him very seriously. These were carefully made films. They had scripts. They had emotion. King Creole, Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock. They assigned him stellar people. Michael Curtiz, who directed King Creole, is the same Michael Curtiz who directed Casablanca. So they treated him with respect.

In fact, several big pop hits into his career, he makes a feature film, and then, very soon signs a contract for a bunch of feature films. Nobody had ever done that.

He wanted to be a great son. Schilling: He was living the most hectic time of his life, career-wise. This was his controlled escape. Springsteen: Graceland. Just the name of it itself pulled directly out of gospel tradition. It's an idealized home. The perfect symbol of someone who's come up from the bottom and-- and enjoyed the best the country has to offer. It was a huge moment for Elvis to walk through those doors and call that place his home. Ferris: It had all of the things that Elvis had never known as a kid. It's not a lavish home. It's not Tara. But it is everything that money and fame could deliver according to his specifications. Man: Yeah, I understand that you bought a home for your folks. And even though your father is only 39, you've insisted that he retire. Is that true? Uh, yes. Well, he's more help, I mean, he's more help at home than he is anywhere else, because, uh... he can take care of all my business. He can, uh, look after things when I'm gone. Man: Well, I think that's-- I think that's very smart. I, of course... Priscilla: Elvis gave Vernon a huge obligation. "Take care of me." He had an office. It gave him a job. It gave him something to do, and it was for his son. They made sure that they kept everything in order, because he was really in fear of not doing the right thing. Schilling: Vernon's office, you can tell, didn't come from a sophisticated business manager. It came from a poor man from Tupelo, Mississippi. Harris: Elvis had all the money in the world. He had anything he wanted. He built Graceland, and yet, he had some sweetness about him that kind of breaks your heart. I mean, really. I don't think he-- he ever lost that. (man speaking) (Elvis speaking) Priscilla: Elvis never wanted to go back to the days where they struggled, the days of poverty. ♪ ♪ Light: In 1958, Elvis was drafted into the Army. And no matter how much he'd been through on the road and making movies, the notion of going to another continent away from his family, was a difficult thing for him to consider. Jorgensen: The idea was, of course, that Elvis would do his duty, so he could come back and be respectable in the Colonel's new vision of the future Elvis Presley, which was a brilliant vision. He knew exactly where he wanted to take Elvis. West: Colonel said, "We don't want any favors. "He's not gonna be in entertainment. He's gonna be a soldier." Reporter: Elvis, you don't get out of the Army until 1960. If rock and roll should diminish in popularity, or even disappear, what would you do? (chuckles) Well, uh... I would probably try acting. I mean, you know, I, uh... Priscilla: Being drafted was something he never thought about happening to him. Petty: The Army, which is odd, because there was no war on. There's not a lot of people being drafted. But Elvis, he goes along with it. Zanes: The biggest star in the world going into the Army. You know, from our historical perspective, that's a very strange episode. But then if you try to get in to his experience, having gone through this profound rise to fame, there's total uncertainty as to what he will return home to, if he returns. Springsteen: Elvis in his 20s, he was still inventing all the rules. In those days, there was no perception that a rock and roll musician could have a long and lasting career. People expected that kind of a career to be over within moments. Jorgensen: RCA panicked. The pushed the Colonel to set up recording sessions before Elvis left, so they could record a lot of material. Light: The impulse was to flood the market, give the fans as much as possible, and keep riding this as hard as you can. Jorgensen: And the Colonel works it the opposite way. His idea was to have just enough material to keep Elvis's name alive. Priscilla: He wanted to keep the mystery. He kept Elvis away from performing, serving for his country like a good soldier. He had fans waiting for him to come back. Man: "I..." I, Elvis Presley... "do solemnly swear..." do solemnly swear... "that I will bear true faith and allegiance," that I will bear true faith and allegiance, "to the United States of America." to the United States of America. Priscilla: His mother was concerned about him going to Germany, 'cause all they heard at that time was Russia. She thought he was going to war. Her son was leaving for two years, and he'd never been out of the United States. When he went to basic training in Texas, they talked every day. And kept saying, "Mama, I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be fighting." But she just couldn't get it into her head. ♪ ♪ (wind whistling) (choir singing) ♪ Oh, by and by ♪ Elvis: ♪ Tempted and tried ♪ ♪ We're oft made ♪ ♪ To wonder ♪ ♪ Why it should be thus ♪ Priscilla: Before he left to serve in Germany, Gladys suddenly got sick and she passed. ♪ ♪ West: When those things happen like that, you don't do a lot of talking. Elvis and his mother, that's the closest I've ever seen anybody as far as that goes. Sure was. Priscilla: She worried about him night and day, because he was such a sensitive boy. And yes, she was overly protective, but because of the loss of the twin brother, that protectiveness really lingered until the day she-- she passed. ♪ ♪ Elvis: ♪ Farther along ♪ ♪ We'll know ♪ ♪ All about it ♪ ♪ Farther along ♪ Cohn: Easy to sneer that Elvis was a mama's boy and so on, but it wasn't that. It was one of those relations between a mother and son where you could hardly say where the mother ends and where the son begins. And when his mother died, it left a hole in him. He was never whole again as it were. He deeply feared not being a good man, being a godly man. He needed her there to say, "I love you, "and you're doing the right thing, and I know you're good." He needed her. Absolutely. ♪ By and by ♪ Priscilla: The loss was the most devastating time in his life. It was all fun before that. It was the skating rink, it was the theater. It was making a movie, then going back to Memphis being with his friends and playing. And then, of course, having Graceland as the center. Fixing all that up for the family, and so, he matured a lot because of the loss of his mother. It was unbearable for him during that time. ♪ ♪ Elvis: ♪ Then do we... ♪ Man: Now, as we're getting closer and closer to the time that they're gonna pull that gangplank away, and you'll be on your way. Since this is probably the last chance that you'll have to say something to your fans, do you have any particular message? Elvis: Well... I'm gonna be very honest about it. Uh, in spite of the fact that I am going away and that I'll be out of their eyes for some time, I hope that I'm not out of their minds. And, uh, I'll be looking forward to the time when I can come back and entertain again like I did, and... Man: All we can do is wish you a wonderful trip and all the best luck in the world and come home soon. Elvis: Well, thank you very much. I'll do my very best. Jorgensen: Elvis hadn't had much time to himself between that summer day when he recorded "That's All Right" and when he was shipped to Germany. Suddenly, on a boat to Germany, there was lots of time. That's where he meets Charlie Hodge, and they start talking about music together. They start singing. (guitar playing) Elvis: ♪ Mona Lisa ♪ ♪ Mona Lisa, men have named you ♪ Light: Charlie Hodge had been a gospel singer, who Elvis had heard sing. Schilling: He liked Charlie because Charlie was in the music business and somebody he could relate to that way. Elvis was so down that Charlie would tell jokes and try to keep him up. ♪ ♪ Elvis: ♪ Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa ♪ Light: To have somebody who he felt understood him, that he could lean on, and also to be able to turn to that music was tremendously important for him to get through that time and everything that was going on. ♪ Brought to your doorstep ♪ ♪ They just lie there ♪ ♪ And they die ♪ ♪ Are you warm? ♪ ♪ Are you real, Mona Lisa? ♪ ♪ Or just a cold and lonely ♪ ♪ Lovely work of art? ♪ (Elvis vocalizing) Jorgensen: When he gets to Germany, yes, he's-- he's obviously, uh, committed to, uh, the hours every day, but there's, again, a lot of spare time in an apartment or at a house in Germany where he doesn't know anybody. So there's a lot of time for reflection. Petty: He goes into the Army, which is where he gets the, um, the pep pills for the first time, the methadrine, to stay up on watch. Priscilla: That was the beginning. He started with the uppers to get him through the Army, to get him through the cold days, to get him through the lonely nights. Man: Do you have any time for, uh, music anymore? Elvis: Well, uh, only at night. You see, I get off work at five o'clock in the afternoon... (beeps) ...and, uh, I have a guitar up here in the room, and I sit around, and you know, up here. I don't want to get out of practice, you know, if I can help it. Man: I sure hope not. Let me tell you... Light: The struggle while Elvis was in the Army was a mandate from Colonel Parker that he not record and not make new music since he wouldn't be able to promote it. But what Elvis didn't know was Parker was not a legal resident in the United States. And without legitimate papers, any travel that he took could present big problems for him trying to get back in. The Colonel, he would come up with excuses and explanations to Elvis, to his family. Priscilla: There'd be telegrams from Colonel Parker telling him not to worry, "I've done this, I've done this." Parker was releasing songs for him every few months to keep the fans interested. Light: But it's not a lot, and not at the pace that they were used to and that the machine required. This approach to Elvis's career was preying on his vulnerability. This was certainly an opportunity for the Colonel to fully seize the role of parent, mentor. The one person who could take him through this difficult time and lead him out the other way. Priscilla: Colonel was like a father figure. There's no doubt about that. And he felt Colonel knew what he was doing. I mean, Colonel brought him to where he was. Sam Phillips couldn't do what Colonel Parker did. He was bright enough to know that. So he was gonna follow what Colonel Parker said. He'd been right so far.

It was open field to see what was he gonna do and where was he gonna go. The work that he had done during his time in the Army broadens the scope of the music that he was interested in.

Blues, reflecting his two years in the Army in a way that probably doesn't compare a lot to what it was like, I don't think he really enjoyed that. G.I. Blues was a family type of film moving Elvis's image in a completely different direction from the very young, aggressive characters in the '50s movies. But he was given the promise that there would be two films for 20th Century Fox, following this, that were serious roles. It may have been a reasonable bargain for Elvis at the time. Priscilla: When he found out the songs that he had to do in G.I. Blues, he said, "Baby, I don't know how this is gonna go. I'm a little disappointed." Jorgensen: The songs they had to fit into the plot, but musically, they were not where Elvis was at. He makes a compromise. That was the really disheartening part for Elvis. The soundtrack of G.I. Blues, it was the most successful album they had made. It sold much more than the absolutely brilliant studio album that came out some months before. Schilling: Elvis is now a big business. So instead of going out, getting the best songwriters in general, Hill &amp; Range, from the Colonel, were hiring a couple of songwriters to write Elvis songs. Briggs: They would bring all of the material, that was the unspoken rule. Nobody else was allowed to bring any music into the session. That was very tightly controlled by the Colonel, by the publishing company, and by the record company. West: The Colonel eventually started getting a percentage of everything. He was a businessman. He didn't give a damn if it was worth a crap. Schilling: Elvis could care less about the songwriting, publishing in general. Some of it, he got and understood, but he cared more about good material. Petty: It was more about the Colonel owning the publishing, which was a huge stone in his shoes the rest of his life. It was this business of "We must own the copyright or we don't want you to do it." Priscilla: Elvis said, "I'm starting to feel the pressure. "I'm obligated here. I don't think there's a way out for me." And I said, "Well, can't you talk to Colonel?" And that's when I think he started getting disillusioned. Basically, Colonel was part of it. Already, he's feeling that he's not in control, and this is really early on. Gladys Presley: ♪ Oh, home sweet home ♪ ♪ There's no place like home ♪ (song continues) Priscilla: I already had a feeling of what Graceland was like through Elvis's description. He told me in Germany, "I want you to come and see Graceland." And he would give me images. When I came, the first time, he told me to close my eyes, and not to open them. We're driving, and then he said, "Open them." The gates of Graceland open up. It was everything that he'd described. It was bigger than life for me. His safe haven. Schilling: Graceland always represented something more than just a house to Elvis. Light: Graceland was something initially that he had bought with and for his parents, and it reminded him of his mother, her presence and her influence in his life, which didn't end after she died. Priscilla: I opened up a closet and it was filled with her clothes. And I had such a sense of her. She liked soft fabric. Her hats, her shoes-- he hung on to those personal things. Even though it had been a few years, there was still a lingering scent there, of her. It really showed me the love that he had for her. Elvis: She never really wanted anything, you know, anything fancy. She just stayed the same all the way through the whole thing. There's a lot of things happened, and there are times when it feels like I don't know what I'm gonna do next, you know? Light: Once he got back to Graceland and wanted to reconnect with the spirit he was brought up in and the memory of his mother, the best way was to go back to the music that he had grown up with. Zanes: The theme of return, and in Elvis's case, a return to gospel, is part of how we all experience music. There are these profound experiences that happen with music at a younger age. Through our lives, we're often chasing them. If you were raised in the proximity of gospel, that's what launched you into the world of emotional music. West: He was getting into another phase in his life, and gospel, religious music, was his favorite, and that's why he did it. Jorgensen: Just on the heels of G.I. Blues, he goes in and records a complete album of gospel music with songs from all his old heroes: Blackwood Brothers, Golden Gate, Statesmen Quartet. It's a tribute to everything he came from, and he does it with a voice at his best ever. Elvis: ♪ Why don't you swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Stop and let me ride ♪ Tony Brown: It was so close to those records that the Statesmen and Blackwoods were making. It could've been those records. Jorgensen: He had the Jordanaires as the key element of developing a gospel feel with a band feel that was true to the music on the Elvis is Back! album. Elvis: ♪ Let me ride ♪ ♪ Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord ♪ Jorgensen: Obviously, it's not really rock and roll, but there's drums and there's saxophones. There's a lot of swing to it. ♪ Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ♪ Elvis: ♪ Well, well ♪ Petty: The way he blended them together is an incredibly original thing to do. Sometimes, you know, he wasn't traveling very far away from the gospel. I mean, some of it, it was just about putting a beat to it. Elvis: ♪ Wasn't so particular about the chariot wheel ♪ Petty: That angle of the two and the four are slightly different than gospel good. Elvis: ♪ Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot, stop ♪ ♪ And let me ride ♪ Jorgensen: You have a feeling that he's truly enjoying this. It's a very joyous record to listen to. Schilling: His Hand in Mine was a passion. The whole gospel influence was as much a part of him, and maybe even more so as the rhythm and blues. This was just his opportunity to get it out. Priscilla: And it was a mission to show others, the listeners, that in these choices of music and how it's embellished, really what Elvis was looking for as an artist, to have that freedom. It's that simple. Elvis: ♪ Just wanted to lay down this heavy load ♪ ♪ Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Stop, let me ride ♪ Man: How's Blue Hawaii going? Elvis: It's going on very well. We leave tomorrow for Kauai, you know. Yeah. I think we'll be there for about 10 days. Man: Tell us about Blue Hawaii a bit. Elvis: There's about 11 songs in it. Some Hawaiian tunes? Yeah. You got some special material written for you for the picture? Elvis: Yeah, we had about 10 songs written especially for the picture. We do that, you know, before the picture starts. ♪ ♪ Jorgensen: The film Blue Hawaii was an overwhelming success. That is the point where it gets real interesting. Jackson: The two dramas, Wild in the Country and Flaming Star, they're not as music heavy, and they actually lose money. Priscilla: And that's when they told him, "This is proof. This is what the public wants. "People just wanna hear your music. They wanna hear you sing in movies." (crowd cheering) Schilling: The last concert he played, for almost a decade, was a charity show near Pearl Harbor. ♪ ♪ (women screaming) Elvis: ♪ Well, so long ♪ Jackson: That was like the ultimate charity show, because it was for the building of the Pearl Harbor memorial. Couldn't be more patriotic. Couldn't have been more of a cause that people could get behind. He's back, he's served his time. He's a great patriot. It was more to build that piece of the story that the Colonel wanted to tell. He's cleaned up and he's a good boy. Elvis: ♪ Let you go ahead on, baby ♪ ♪ Pray that you'll come back home some time ♪ Boots Randolph. (women scream) Jackson: The band that he brings with him is very interesting. He has Scotty and DJ, but he brings with him his all-star Nashville, session guy band, including Boots Randolph, who was a great saxophone player. ♪ ♪ (women screaming) Jackson: Boots Randolph brings in a lead instrument that can balance out Elvis's singing in a way that Scotty playing rockabilly licks didn't do previously. So it just becomes a much more full sound. ♪ ♪ Light: It's a tragedy that he didn't continue to play live for people at that point. But the Colonel knew that the films got Elvis in front of millions of people simultaneously with as little work as possible. Landau: The post-Army films, I went to them. They were a separate category for what happened in the '50s. He finds himself in a situation where he's just churning out stuff that he couldn't possibly have believed in. Elvis: ♪ I said, take it easy, baby, I worked all day ♪ ♪ And my feet feel just like lead ♪ ♪ You got my shirttails flying all over the place ♪ ♪ And the sweat poppin' outta my head ♪ ♪ She said, Hey, bossa nova, baby, keep on workin' ♪ ♪ For this ain't no time to quit ♪ ♪ She said, Go bossa nova, baby, keep on dancin' ♪ ♪ I'm about to have myself a fit ♪ ♪ Bossa nova, bossa nova ♪ Schilling: The Colonel negotiated contract after contract. MGM, Paramount, United Artists, you name it. Hal Blaine: He was inundated with work, work, work, work. Elvis: ♪ I can dance with a drink in my hand ♪ ♪ She said, Hey, bossa nova, baby, keep on workin' ♪ ♪ For this ain't no time to drink ♪ Blaine: Everybody was trying to get every penny they could out of whatever they could. ♪ Bossa nova ♪ ♪ ♪ Jackson: He had to make three movies a year. So these soundtrack albums became a big part of the contractual obligation to release music with RCA. Elvis: ♪ Bossa nova ♪ West: That was not his music. It was killing his recording career, because they were movie songs, situation songs. Priscilla: Obviously, in some of the movies, you got some hits-- "Viva Las Vegas," "Bossa Nova Baby." They weren't all bad, but because it was connected to a movie, it wasn't like a real record. The songs had to fit the scene. Jorgensen: And the Colonel obviously knew that the best format was girls and beautiful locations. Robbie Robertson: I thought it was terrible direction-- the idea to do a bunch of corny-ass movies, Where this is all being led? It's no-man's-land. Petty: He-- he certainly knows this music is crap. The movies were very harmful to his image. As an innovator, as a great musician, they were harmful. He's very talented. I mean, he's very present. It's an incredible image of him. But where he had a nice start in the movies and did do some creative things early on, and you could see that there was great potential for this guy, there was really no way for him to become the huge movie star that he would've liked to have been and the Colonel keep control of it. You know, there's too many creative aspects gonna come in, and they're gonna challenge the Colonel's carnival mentality. Colonel Tom Parker: Well, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Far as I was concerned, I was not involved other than making the contract. He had the opportunity to say, "I don't want to do it or I'd like to do it." No one told him he had to make a picture that he didn't want to do. When we had a script, we'd deliver it to Elvis. Schilling: Elvis did refuse a bad picture. In comes the Colonel, in comes the studios, in comes the record company. They would say to him, "You don't fulfill your contracts, you won't do anything." ♪ Well, come on everybody ♪ ♪ And turn your head to the left ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on everybody ♪ Jackson: In Viva Las Vegas, it's the closest he ever gets to having a true co-star. ♪ Take a real deep breath and repeat after me ♪ Jackson: That becomes a problem for the Colonel, because he doesn't want anybody to even come close to outshining Elvis. ♪ Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me ♪ Chorus: ♪ My baby loves me ♪ ♪ My baby loves me ♪ Chorus: ♪ My baby loves me ♪ ♪ My baby loves me ♪ ♪ I said, my baby ♪ Ha! ♪ My baby ♪ ♪ Loves me ♪ Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ann-Margaret (laughing): Wee-ha! Binder: The Colonel did not want Ann-Margaret in his world after she got a lot of press. Anybody who had influence on Elvis was a threat. Landau: The tragedy of the old style of management was to try and maintain control of the artist by limiting their exposure to opportunities. The Colonel was not interested in Elvis becoming too independent of a thinker. He needed Elvis to think that everything good came from the Colonel and anything bad came from imagined enemies. He kept that con game going for much too long. Zanes: The years spent chasing the movies, you know, seven years, they were very destabilizing for Elvis, because music was always the buoy. Jackson: It's clear about halfway through that period, he becomes very restless, and very annoyed with the whole process. Schilling: Elvis didn't have script approval. There weren't great budgets. Priscilla: The humdrum movies that he was given-- boy chase girl, boy gets girl, they get married, and it's happily ever after-- that was not Elvis Presley. He was not that man. He was much deeper than that. He had no inspiration whatsoever. He knew he had to make it work. He knew he was under a contract, and he walked through every one of them. After a movie, he felt trapped. He dreaded the next script, because he knew it would be the same thing over and over again. But the disconnect, the disconnect in the two was really wearing on his mind-- that Colonel was not taking him to the place he needed to be. Petty: This is what we'll never understand is why did Colonel Parker have this kind of influence over him. Why was he willing to knowingly humiliate himself for this man, or for the money promised him by this man? He puts up with it. Porter: I have never felt Elvis was lost. He knew with all those movies, as is the case with every artist, that they're taking themselves away from their strength. Many artists can't get back to where their strengths are. Emmylou Harris: An artist has to constantly grow, and to continue creating, and changing, and being inspired by things around him in a spiritual or a personal way. ♪ ♪ Elvis: I'd like to stay in the same vein. I-I mean, I wouldn't like to, uh, be at a standstill, you know what I mean? I'd like-- I'd like to progress. I'd like to do a lot of things, but I... I realize, uh, that it takes time, and you can't, uh, you can't go out of your, uh, capa-- uh, your limitations. You have to know your capabilities, you know. Like I have people to say to me all the time, (stammering) "Why don't you do an artistic picture? "Why don't you do this picture and that picture? Why don't you go do something blah, blah?" Well, that's fine, but, uh... Uh, I would like to. I'd like to do something someday where I feel that I really done a good job. You know, as an actor in a certain type role, if what you're doing is doing okay, you're better off sticking with it until, you know, until just time itself changes things. ♪ ♪ Zanes: The great irony is that Elvis was such a significant force in the launch of rock and roll, and the very revolution that he sparked carries on without him. There is a renaissance that is underway, and he is, in effect, in a bubble in Hollywood, as it passes him by. Priscilla: '63, '64, '65, when all the bands were coming in, he just didn't really wanna hear music. He didn't wanna hear the songs. Was there room for him now, being a solo artist? Elvis really wasn't interested in writing his own music, and all these other groups coming up, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Beach Boys, they all wrote their own songs, so they could direct their careers in a way Elvis couldn't. Petty: There is no road map at this point as to what a rock and roller does when he gets older. The Beatles had each other. You know, they had four people together to go through it. And Elvis was totally alone. There was no one vaguely his equal. There was nobody he could bounce anything off of. Priscilla: Elvis really didn't ask for anybody's advice. He didn't ask the guys for their advice. Oh my gosh, he would never. I mean, you didn't tell Elvis what to sing or what movie he should be in. Elvis was truly his own man. He needed someone to come in with a game plan and offer it to him. "What do you think of this?" But he hung out with the same people all the time. We all lived in this bubble. Very few outsiders came in. His world was really quite small, and only consisted of us, people that he trusted. You didn't really talk about the movies around Elvis. We didn't go there. Why get him upset? And people-- the guys were around to bring him up. Schilling: Elvis was going to us and saying, "Damn it, I know there's good music out there. I hear it. Why am I not getting it?" Petty: You can tell his interest in making records has kind of gone away. You don't get him in the studio a lot. Priscilla: He was just struggling with what to do next and where to go, trying to figure out his purpose again. It was very difficult to watch. ♪ ♪ Odetta: ♪ How many roads ♪ ♪ Must a man walk down ♪ ♪ Before you call him a man ♪ Light: By this point, Elvis had grown so disconnected from the music that he was recording.

Odetta: ♪ How many times ♪ ♪ Must a cannonball fly ♪ Light: He was interested in this new folk music-- Peter, Paul, &amp; Mary, the songs of Bob Dylan.

Landau: A couple of really bright guys who got Elvis talked their way into making a TV special. Their mission was to remind everybody just who Elvis had been, and who he still was-- in a sense, to erase the last seven years of the movie soundtracks. Light: When the opportunity for the TV special is presented, he hasn't performed for an audience for years. Priscilla: He was actually thinking what he would do if everything went wrong. This was his career. This was his life. This was the moment of realization that this is it, that this is gonna be either a complete failure or it'll change everything. Springsteen: Well, I remember I waited for weeks for the '68 Special 'cause I knew it was coming. I can remember exactly where our TV was set up in the dining room, the exact place I was sitting. I mean, it's one of those things that's imprinted on my memory forever. But you weren't sure if he had the ability to focus and gather it all together one more time to create musical explosiveness.

Schilling: When I went with him to NBC, he was very quiet. He didn't know how people were gonna feel about it. Priscilla: He was extremely nervous that night. It's all new again, and I'd never seen Elvis perform live before. I didn't really know what to expect. Binder: We didn't know where it was gonna go, period. Just before it began, on the first taping, Elvis called me into the makeup room. He was sitting there and he asked everybody in the room to leave, so he could just be with me one on one.

I was missing that. ♪ Well, I never been to Heaven ♪ ♪ But I've been to Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Well, they tell me I was born there ♪ ♪ But I really don't remember ♪ ♪ In Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Or Arizona ♪ ♪ Yeah, what does it matter? ♪ ♪ What does it matter? ♪ Landau: Back in the 1970s, I was working for Rolling Stone. They sent me to Boston to review an Elvis concert. "He stands there in a black jumpsuit, "gold spangles and an orange cape. "When he stretches out his hands, "the cape forms a half-sun "under his outstretched arms, and he looks like the true king of rock and roll. "He parades in front of 15,000 people, "and waits for the applause to wash over, "and it comes as it always does "and as he knows it will. "Elvis Presley has lived through "the greatest superstar trip of any performer, "and he survived it in his own kind of way. "Elvis participates in a pure one-to-one relationship with his audience. "When he steps on the stage, "it is he and he alone who is the subject of the manic, ecstatic, irrational adoration." Elvis: ♪ I've never been to Heaven ♪ Landau: "His brilliance is reflected in his control." ♪ But I've been to Oklahoma ♪ Landau: "He never moves too far in any one direction, and never loses his grip." ♪ They tell me I was born there ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ But I really don't remember ♪ ♪ In Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Or Arizona ♪ Landau: "To me, no matter how frustrating "the lapses in his career have been, he remains an artist..." Elvis: ♪ In Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Or Arizona ♪ Landau: "...an American artist, whom we should be proud to claim as our own." Elvis: ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ (song ending) Thank you. (applause) Brown: Elvis, in concert, covered all kinda genres, you know. And he came out and he would do all those songs from the '50s and '60s that he broke with. But during the show, there was a lot of country standards. He just did things that he liked. Man: You have any thoughts about the rising interest in country music? I think it's fantastic. You see, country music was always a part of the influence on my-- on my type of music anyway. It's a combination of, uh... country music, and gospel, and rhythm and blues all combined. That's what it really was. As a child, I was influenced by all of that. But I like the blues, and I like, uh, the gospel music, gospel quartets and all that. Thank you. Good rehearsal, see you soon. Springsteen: If you look at the band he put together for the '70s shows, there was a huge gospel contingent. Those sections of the show were so powerful. Straight out of white and black gospel tradition. Elvis: ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Springsteen: In the '70s, Elvis had moved on to "American Trilogy." His show was consisting of a huge cross-cultural picture of America and Americana. (Elvis vocalizing) Springsteen: He was trying to encompass an image of the country as a whole that he could be a vessel that could contain the entirety of American experience. ♪ Oh hush, little baby ♪ ♪ Don't you cry ♪ Petty: You know, that version of "Dixie" and uh, the "Battle Hymn of the Republic," it's so beautiful! You know, the band he's put together is so over-the-top, and only Elvis would have that kinda spending power, and just audacious craziness. Choirs, and orchestras, and a great rhythm section, maybe another gospel group on the side. None of it makes sense until you suddenly hear something like that, and they're all playing a role in that, and it's very moving music. (flute playing) When you see him do that music in those little pieces of film that I've seen of him, that's the pure joy of music in the man. You know, that's when I see everything stop. (music crescendoes) ♪ ♪ ♪ Glory, glory ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ His truth is ♪ ♪ Marching ♪ ♪ On ♪ ♪ His truth is ♪ ♪ Marching ♪ ♪ On ♪ (wild cheering) Elvis: Whoo! Thank you, thank you. Whew! Boy. How was the sound in that building? Very good, very good. Here. Hold on. Strickland: That was his life. He lived to sing and perform. It's a hot time in Florida. Man: Boy, it is. Springsteen: An artist like Elvis is, rather than pretending when he goes on the stage, he's actually pretending, when he's home, to be normal. And when he goes out on stage at night, it's who he actually is. It's a very difficult dichotomy. Priscilla: To see him become even bigger than life, he had so much so soon. Harris: He was snatched from the ordinary life of a-- of a young man into a place that no one else had ever been in society or in our culture. Zanes: To have that success, and to experience it, he had to hand over significant portions of youth. That was the trade. He is unmoored from the Earth experience. Priscilla: We were living two different lives. He was performing, and, uh, and he was home very, very little. It was very difficult to communicate at that time. Uh, Elvis had a horrible fear of not sleeping. He would spend many, many nights alone, and he would think and that would keep him up. So he started on sleeping pills, and he thought that he had it under control. Everything that he ever had was prescribed. (indistinct chatter) Man: Are you satisfied with the image you've established? Uh... well, the image is one thing, and a human being is another, you know, so. Man: How close does the image come to the man? It's very hard to live up to an image, I'll put it that way. Parker: Come on, bring your cameras over here. Come on through here. Elvis: Soon as the Colonel gets through talking, I'll tell you-- I'm-- I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, I'd like to do something. Uh, there's so many places that I haven't been yet. I'd like to go to Europe. I'd like to go to Japan and all those places. I-I've never been out of this country except in the service, you know. Light: Elvis, from early on, had expressed interest in touring overseas having no idea that Colonel Parker was never going to let him. Because if the Colonel went with him, he was afraid he was not gonna be let back into America. Schilling: Colonel knowing that Elvis wanted to tour overseas, colonel not wanting anybody to know that he wasn't a US citizen, how could he answer Elvis but come up with something that nobody had ever done. Jackson: Instead of shutting down the idea of Elvis playing in different countries and just sort of curtailing it for now, he actually uses it to his advantage, and creates the first-ever live concert simulcast on satellite television, so that people in every country all over the world can see Elvis play a concert. Light: By the time of the Aloha special, Elvis had been touring non-stop. His health wasn't great, his weight wasn't great, and now he was confronted with this performance that was gonna be seen by a billion people around the world. Whew! It's so very hard to comprehend it, because I... In 15 years, it's hard to comprehend that happening. To all the countries all over the world via satellite, it's very difficult to comprehend. Jackson: It becomes the biggest media moment of his career up to that point. And he knows this. He's trimmed down for it. He looks amazing. The band is super tight. Light: Aloha does represent Elvis music, the moment that Elvis brought together all of his influences to solidify an image of Elvis, a look and a style and a presentation that seals in amber, this is what Elvis is. Zanes: Elvis was the first major televisual musical star. We can see him, but we can't touch him. Elvis, without intending to, created an image of himself he would never live past. ♪ Yeah, now this time ♪ ♪ Lord, you gave me ♪ ♪ A mountain ♪ ♪ A mountain ♪ ♪ I may never climb ♪ ♪ It isn't ♪ Landau: That show was another way in which he was truly disserved by the Colonel. It's a bit of a metaphor for keeping the blinders on, which is what I think the Colonel is all about. Petty: My picture of the Colonel really is someone that loves selling merchandise, you know, that wants it to the end, walk the aisle selling posters and ballpoint pens. It doesn't make any sense really to keep him from touring other countries, to keep him from really going to, you know, the whole way with the music, like, letting him be an artist. (crowd cheering) Elvis: Thank you! Schilling: I think the troubles between Elvis and the Colonel started getting worse at that point. There was the bond, but they were two very different people. Priscilla: Elvis outgrew Colonel Parker as an artist, but he, um, didn't know how to cut the strings. Light: By this time, he had started to turn to prescription drugs to keep himself going. He was on a relentless wheel of performance to travel to performance to travel, and you start to see the stress of that. Binder: All the things he told me that he wanted to do-- travel the world, meet new audiences-- none of that happened. All the light went out of his eyes. Zanes: With an addiction to prescription pills, if you are a performer, what you're after is the anesthetizing part of it. But that's gonna take you away from your powers as a performer, and he's gonna go on stage nonetheless. Landau: He had many afflictions, and he hurt himself in many ways. But there was a core in there, that, if you let it, would shine through, and sometimes in the most unlikely places. ♪ ♪ ♪ Lord Almighty ♪ ♪ I feel my temperature rising ♪ ♪ Hmm ♪ Tutt: We has basically tried to influence him to do more rock and roll. "Burning Love," that one had some potential. He never felt comfortable with it, because he had a hard time with the lyrics. Priscilla: He was going through a lot at that time, so he didn't want to do the song, and the guys kept expressing that he should do it, and he was really fighting it. Landau: "Burning Love," well, it's one of the greatest records he ever made. ♪ Like the sweet song of the choir ♪ ♪ And you light my morning sky ♪ ♪ With burning love ♪ ♪ With burning love ♪ Chorus: ♪ Hunk of burning love ♪ Elvis: ♪ Just a hunk of hunk of burning love ♪ Chorus: Ahhh! ♪ A hunk of hunk of burning love ♪ Chorus: Ahhh! ♪ A hunk of hunk of-- ♪ (music stops) Priscilla: It was a hard song for him to sing and to get into. About them lyrics... (laughter) It was only one, and I hit my mouth. Priscilla: He wanted to let out his feelings in a-- in a song that related to how he felt. It was difficult to be given music for something that's really uplifting, upbeat, and that's not matching his tone, that's not matching his feelings. ♪ ♪ ♪ I see a change ♪ ♪ Is coming to our lives ♪ ♪ It's not the same as it used to be ♪ ♪ And it's not too late ♪ ♪ To realize our mistake ♪ ♪ We're just not right ♪ ♪ For each other ♪ ♪ Love has slipped away ♪ ♪ Left us only friends ♪ ♪ We almost seem like strangers ♪ ♪ All that's left between us ♪ ♪ Are the memories we share ♪ ♪ Of times we thought we cared ♪ ♪ For each other ♪ Priscilla: Elvis was very family oriented.

And he would just look up and shake his head, 'cause I know he still always loved Priscilla. Priscilla: Elvis and I, you know, we held hands in court. There was still a lot of love there. He was a doting father. We kept that relationship very close. I know he was always there for me, and for Lisa as well, but the breakup of the marriage was painful for both of us. (vocalizing) Gordon Stoker: He was never the same after that. He just changed. He was very moody. He just wasn't well doing two shows a night. And he had to take uppers to get him going and downers to put him to sleep. Parker: Well, I don't know, but I know one thing. When I told Elvis to slow down, he said, "I wanna play more dates." So I booked more dates. I said, "Well, I don't think you should," and he said, "Well, it's what I wanna do." He was very unhappy, so we started all over again. Announcer: With some 25 colored portraits available... Man: Souvenirs! Hey! Take home a little bit of Elvis! Elvis super souvenirs! Cohn: I think night by night, it became harder for him to-- to carry on being Elvis. Drugs and the self-destructiveness were all punishments. He was in great pain, and yet, he gave so much pleasure. He would go offstage and collapse, and the audience would go out buoyed up and joyous, spiritually blessed. Priscilla: Elvis was always searching for answers. Why him? "Well, maybe God had something else planned for me. Am I supposed to be giving a message?" Not realizing he was doing what he was supposed to be doing. Petty: The last days of his life was not his best work. He had a lot of problems. He had gained weight which is a cardinal sin in show business. Isolation, you know, that-- that brings on the drug abuse. He's lost touch with his father. His mom's gone. His wife is gone. It had to be very lonely, we know that. There's a point when-- when you have success, and you get really wealthy and there is that day where the letter comes that none of this is gonna make me happy. And he knew he had to try to find some-- something, you know, but I think he gave up. I think he felt out-gunned and gave up. Priscilla: Those last shows, those shows those last couple of years were not the most memorable as far as performance. Sometimes he didn't get through a-- a song. I think the last year, he was pretty much over it. I don't even know why, you know, he went on stage. They're just hard to watch. Sometimes, I think it was better, maybe, if they just canceled the show. Brown: We got the call that Elvis wanted to record in Memphis. Strickland: Whenever we got the call, we would be there at his beck and call whenever they were ready. Brown: In my mind, we're going to, like, Sun Records or someplace over there, Chips Moman's studio. But we pull into Graceland, and I say, "Well, what are we doing here?" They said, "We're cutting here." Strickland: He wouldn't go to the studio. The studio had to come to him, right in the Jungle Room there. Man: It's hard to get him to go into a studio environment, because he was uncomfortable there. Man 2: Didn't wanna go to Nashville, didn't want to go to Stax, didn't want to go to Chips Moman's. He wanted to stay at home. Strickland: We would come over from Nashville, check into a hotel that was just right down the street. Man: And then, we'd all be ready there to go, and they'd say, "Elvis is still not up." Strickland: He could come down at midnight or it could be two o'clock in the morning. You never knew what the night was gonna hold. Springsteen: Elvis ended up back in the Jungle Room, recording his last record. Graceland can be something that's-- that gives you a sense of-- of place, and of-- of center. Uh, but it can also be a place where-- that you just disappear into. It seemed to me that Elvis was caught in-between doing a little bit of both there. Petty: Seems to be, he's picking songs that somewhat reflect his state of mind. Like "Hurt" which is one of the-- the very last ones. I think he's-- he's feeling very hurt. He's very down. He's very alone. He doesn't understand what's happened to music, and he got left out of that. He had become a thing. He was no longer Elvis Presley. He was "Elvis." Norbert Putnam: Well, when I first came over to the Jungle Room, they had removed all the furniture. They covered the walls in blankets. Strickland: There was a semi, like a very large tractor trailer, out behind the house. It was RCA's complete mobile recording studio. They would run all their recording lines into the Jungle Room. Brown: It looks like you're in Tahiti or something. It looked like you were in the islands. But we're all just crammed into this tiny little space. Tutt: It was a nightmare for the recording engineers to keep that sound clean without too much bleed with open microphones, and we did our best to do the recordings as best we could. Strickland: It wasn't like we did a lot of rehearsal for the recordings. It was "Turn the machine on, and he's gonna sing." We would all watch each other doing it on the fly. And you know, I-I remember one of the first songs that I recorded with him, uh, was "Hurt." We didn't have a clue of how it was gonna go down or how he would perform it. All of a sudden, he takes his stance. ♪ ♪ Elvis: ♪ I'm ♪ ♪ So hurt ♪ ♪ To think that you lied to me ♪ ♪ I'm hurt ♪ ♪ Way down deep inside of me ♪ ♪ You said ♪ ♪ Our love was true ♪ ♪ And we'd never ♪ ♪ Never part ♪ ♪ Now you want someone new ♪ ♪ And it breaks my heart ♪ ♪ Oh, I'm hurt ♪ ♪ Much more ♪ ♪ Than you'll ever know ♪ ♪ Yes, darling ♪ ♪ I'm so hurt ♪ ♪ Because ♪ ♪ I still love you so ♪ ♪ But you know ♪ ♪ Even though you hurt me ♪ ♪ Like nobody else ♪ ♪ Could ever do ♪ ♪ I would never ever ♪ ♪ Hurt ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Yeah, you ♪ (song ends) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Bearde: Elvis wanted to finish the '68 Special on a big note.

Bearde: While we were sitting in Steve's office with Elvis, we had a little black and white television in the corner. (indistinct chatter) On that TV... Robert Kennedy was assassinated. (indistinct shouting) Elvis picked up a guitar, and he started playing. Talking at a mile a minute. He said, "I want you to understand me, "because this is a moment in time where we all have to understand each other." ♪ ♪ ♪ There must be lights burning brighter ♪ ♪ Somewhere ♪ ♪ Got to be birds flying higher ♪ ♪ In a sky more blue ♪ ♪ If I can dream of a better land ♪ ♪ Where all my brothers walk hand in hand ♪ ♪ Tell me why ♪ ♪ Oh, why ♪ ♪ Oh, why can't my dream come true ♪ ♪ Oh, why ♪ ♪ There must be peace and understanding ♪ ♪ Sometime ♪ ♪ Strong winds of promise ♪ ♪ That will blow away all the doubt ♪ ♪ And fear ♪ ♪ If I can dream of a warmer sun ♪ ♪ Where hope keeps shining on everyone ♪ ♪ Tell me why ♪ ♪ Oh, why ♪ ♪ Oh, why won't that sun ♪ ♪ Appear ♪ ♪ We're lost in a cloud ♪ ♪ With too much rain ♪ ♪ We're trapped in a world ♪ ♪ That's troubled with pain ♪ ♪ But as long as a man has the strength to dream ♪ ♪ He can redeem his soul ♪ ♪ And fly ♪ Choir: ♪ He can fly ♪ ♪ Deep in my heart ♪ ♪ There's a trembling question ♪ ♪ Still I am sure that the answer ♪ ♪ Answer's gonna come somehow ♪ ♪ Out there in the dark ♪ ♪ There's a beckoning candle ♪ ♪ Oh yeah, and while I can think ♪ ♪ While I can talk ♪ ♪ While I can stand ♪ ♪ While I can walk ♪ ♪ While I can dream ♪ ♪ Please let my dream ♪ ♪ Come true ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Oh, let it come true right now ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ (song ends) (film reel whirring) ♪ ♪ Petty: ♪ Can't you see ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ Please don't break my heart in two ♪ ♪ That's not hard to do ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart ♪ ♪ And if you say goodbye ♪ ♪ Then I know that I would cry ♪ ♪ Maybe I would die ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart ♪ ♪ There's no strings ♪ ♪ Upon this love of mine ♪ ♪ It was always you from the start ♪ ♪ Treat me nice ♪ ♪ Treat me good ♪ ♪ Treat me like you really should ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm not made of wood ♪ ♪ And I don't have a wooden heart ♪ ♪ No, I don't have a wooden heart ♪ (music ends)
