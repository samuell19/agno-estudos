(disc squeaks) (disc bangs) - [Narrator] Far, far away, beyond the horizon and even further, there stood a palace of such brilliant beauty that nothing could compare with it. The palace was built of the purest gold. When the sun hit its walls, one could even on the far side of the horizon, discern a glowing light. Behind the palace, there was a magical glacier. Every time the light from the golden walls hit the glacier a piece of ice melted and dripped. These drops of water were collected in a vault, deep inside the palace. They were the purest drops one could ever imagine. They could heal anything. This was the water of life. (dramatic music) The shimmering light in the distance made many set out on a search. They wanted to find out if the magical golden palace really existed. But no one ever returned home alive. Because on the throne sat a greedy and avaricious king. With his mighty guardian he watched over his treasures. Nothing was to be shared with anyone. No one else would ever drink from the water. No one would ever be allowed to enter his palace. You may have heard the name, but you have never seen it. The Palace of Soria Moria. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (adventurous music) (saw scraping) (ax chopping) (branches crashing) - Nils! Look out! (tree crashes) (man gasps) - Which one of you decided to chop down that tree? - My fault. - Hmm. You are fired, and you can just forget about this month's pay. - Hey. What do you say you just give him a warning? - Are you seriously telling me how to do my job? Okay, you're all fired. - [Pal] What, me too? - Yes, you can thank Espen for that. - [Per] Okay, and so Espen took the blame. - You did what? - My friend, Nils, needed that job, Dad. - [Dad] You speak as if we didn't. We need the money. What do we do now? - [Per] Good question. - [Pal] It's not easy when Espen always ends up in trouble. - Always, huh? (horse whining) Who on Earth is that? (upbeat music) - Hmm, yeah. - Hello? - I'm sorry, I think we're lost. Could you tell me the way to the home of, um, Even Hashley? - Maybe you mean Espen Ash Lad? - I don't think so, Espen. - No, no, no. I mean Esken Ashpot. - You're absolutely sure you don't mean Espen Ash Lad? - Espen! - Yes, it's right here. It says, "To Espen Ash Lad". - Yeah, that's me. - Um, really? - Yeah that's me. And this is our farm. - Right. "To Espen Ash Lad and brothers," "You're invited to the ball in the royal palace "to celebrate my 19th birthday. "Signed by Princess Kristin." - Oh, thank you so much. (laughs) - "We had too much food prepared "so we decided to invite you." - Does it say that? - No, I made that up myself. (laughs) Let's go! - [Espen] We're going to a ball! - [Brothers] Goodbye! - I don't really get why we're invited. - Are you kidding? Didn't we save Kristin from the troll? - Yeah, but that was so long ago. - Not that long ago. - We'll probably be the guests of honor. - You think so? - Yeah, but we have to look really good. What are we gonna wear? - Wear to the dance? - And how do you greet a king? Bow to him? Curtsy? - [Dad] Party clothes? We'll fix it. There's nothing to worry about. - Let's see. There you go. - Thank you. (laughs) Hi, Mom. - You're so pretty. - Thank you. - [Queen] Many prominent people will be here today. - [Kristin] Yes, I just hope I know how to speak to them. - [Queen] You'll be just fine. - I just wish I had the chance to decide to do on my birthday. - Please remember, our personal needs come second, my dear. - Yes. Kingdom comes first. - [Queen] Mm-hmm (chuckles). - Hey, Dad, this feels - Look at these stately fellows. Do I know you? What have you done with my sons? Better get going. Enjoy the party. Espen? - Yeah? - Did you remember your tribute? - Yeah. Do you think she'll like it? - Yes, I hope so. I was your age when I first met your mother. It was at a party, but not a royal one. - No (chuckles) There'll be a lot of royals there. We're not gonna fit in. - But Espen, you just have to be yourself. (dramatic music) - See you soon, Papa! - [Pal] Goodbye, we'll be thinking of you! - Behave yourselves! You're not going to a barn dance! (adventurous music) (festive music) - Who let those hicks in? - Uh, I think I'll go get something to eat. - [Announcer] Count Gustav of Gontalang. - There she is! - [Gustav] Happy birthday, your beautiful highness. - I'll go say hi. - Great. - The Grand Duke of Flanders. - We need more plum wine over there. - [Announcer] Phillip the Great of Copenhagen. - I'm not the servant. - Hmm. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to see that someone appreciates the food. - My pleasure. - Would you, so would you like to have a dance? - Who, me? (chuckles) Um, Per, where are you? Help! - Hang up my coat. - [Announcer] The mayor of Byzantium. - But - You shouldn't leave me alone here. - These people are a bunch of snobs. You know what? If I were king I'd organize real parties because this-- - This is to be served to king and queen. - But, I - Don't just stand there. - [Announcer] The Earl of Holland. - All right. Hi. - What was your name? - Espen Ash Lad. - Yes. Escland Hooskland. - Espen! - Hi! (king clears throat) Yeah, nice party. - I really wanted to go hunting, but they insisted I have a party. (chuckles) - Oh, I, um, uh, I brought a little gift. - Ooh, of course, Prince Raul of Catalonia. - It's not much, but uh (chuckles) - Out of my way! Princess Kristin, I'm Raul, prince of the reign of Catalonia. - My dear, who are all those peasants that somehow got invited. - [Queen] It's Kristin's day. She invites who she wants. - The duke of Normandy. (man in crowd laughs) The baron of Bohemia - Look at this peasant. - We don't fit in here. Let's go home. - Fine with me. - Yeah. - Your majesty, it's time for your speech. - Yes, of course, Sven. Thank you very much. - [Announcer] Please come closer. Come closer. His royal highness is about to give a speech. - If you would. Welcome, my dear guests. Let us raise our glasses and drink a toast to my daughter, the birthday girl. - Cheers. - [Crowd] Cheers. - My sweet daughter, Kristin, you are an adult now. But it seems like only yesterday when we cradled a little bundle of joy in our arms. I have no idea where those years have gone. Time is something that we can't understand. Somehow we think it will last forever, but then it slips through your fingers (choking) (wheezing) (dramatic music) - Oh, your majesty! - Oh, what's happened? (crowd shouting) - Papa! Wake up, wake up! Please wake up! Mama, are you okay? - This wine is suspicious. Did you drink from it? - No. - Good. - Him, he served the wine. I saw him. - Hey, wait a minute. - I saw you. - No, it was not me. - I heard you say if you were king we'd have real festivities. - He disguised himself as a servant to get close to the royals. - I said if I were king, nothing else but if. Anyway, why would I wanna do such a thing? I'm not like that. You people don't know me. - They should be thrown to snakes. - Because I'm dressed like a servant? Let go of me. Let go of me. (crowd gasps) - That's not mine. I've never seen that before in my whole life. - Roll them in a barrel of nails! - Arrest them! - Cut off their ears. - Stop! - [Crowd] Arrest them! - Princess, I hope you know we have to punish them. We mustn't show weakness. A severe punishment is what's called for. - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Per! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Per! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - Arrest them! - [Crowd] Arrest them! - Throw them in the dungeon - Kristin? - Until I find out what happened. - [Pal] This is a mistake. - Per, I'll find out what happened. I'll sort this out. - Espen! (somber music) (Kristin sobbing) - I need to talk to Kristin. (Kristin sobbing) - There's no doubt. This is cindergrass, a rare and deadly plant extract. There is no antidote. They will never wake up again. - No! (Kristin sobbing) - Your highness, your highness, I realize that this is hard for you to deal with right now. - [Kristin] No! - And it hurts me to have to tell you this, but you'll have to ascend the throne as queen. - It's just too soon. I don't think I can. - Wait! We can still save them. Have you ever heard of Soria Moria? - (scoffs) The Golden Palace? - [Espen] Yeah. - Everybody knows that's just a fairy tale. - Well there's always some truth in all fairy tales. (chuckles) They say Soria Moria was built in the spring of the water of life. This water is said to cure absolutely everything. - [Doctor] This is ridiculous. - But how do you know the palace exists? - I know the way. - [Kristin] You do? - Yeah. Let me take you there. - I think you should consider what's safest and best for your country, Princess. We know the Danes are on their way. The kingdom is under attack. So it is of the greatest importance that you remain here. What if something bad happens to you? - We'll go to the palace. (adventurous music) You remember the way there? - [Espen] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. (adventurous music) Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I was wrong. - [Kristin] Wrong? - I'm only human. See that? - [Kristin] See what? - [Espen] We're on the right track. - What do you think you're doing? - [Espen] I know someone who maybe knows for sure where it is. - [Kristin] You wait here. (people chattering) - [Olman] So. How did it go? - The king and the queen are dead. - [Olman] Great. The Danish king will be delighted. That gives us time to organize our troops. - But the princess isn't. - [Olman] What? - She left for something called the Soria Moria Palace to get the water of life. - Soria Moria? - [Traitor] Yeah. - That's just a tale for fools. - So they say, but it seems true now. - Interesting. - And my payment? - Yes, of course. You deserve every penny. (chuckles) Here you are. - [Traitor] Thanks. - You're rich, buddy. - Why don't we take one for the road to celebrate? - [Gang] Yeah! - No, I really should be going. I should go back to the palace before they suspect. - No, no, no. - No, you must stay. Keep us company. - [Gang Member] Hungry? - [Traitor] Well, no. - [Gang Member] You sure? - [Traitor] Oh, hi there. You sure are pretty. - [Olman] Here you go. - [Gang Member] That's for you. - Let us drink a toast to this charming little country called Norway. Little Norway. Cheers. - [Gang] To Norway! (chuckles) - Do you know the meaning of aquavit? - No. - It's a Latin word. It means the water of life. Ironic, no? (laughs) (choking) (gasping) (laughs) - So now that that's out of the way, Olman, what happens with the princess? - We'll follow her. If the palace really does exist then we're in for a treat, my boys. (dramatic music) - Who are we looking for? - An old and frail lady. This is where I met her last time so I'm sure she lives nearby. - You don't even know where she lives? - No. Hey! Oh, hi there. You haven't seen a weird old lady around here, have ya? (squirrel twitters) What, you want us to come with you? - Where do you think you're off to now? - [Espen] Come! (speaks in foreign language) - You've got to be kidding. Wait up! Is it your idea to be chasing squirrels? We're still chasing the squirrel. Oh great. - Are you doing all right? She's trying to show us something. Come. (Kristin groans) - We're only running in circles. And that's just - You see, we found it. (Stump Woman grunts) Hi! - [Stump Woman] Ash Lad? - Yeah, it's me. - [Stump Woman] Thank goodness. I need you to unstuck me before I lose my head and my nose. - Okay, no problem. Try to take a deep breath. Okay. Come on. (Stump Woman grunting) - Third time this week. So, who's this beautiful girl? - May I present Princess Kristin? - Hi. - Kristin, this is, uh, the Stump Woman. - No. Don't call me that. I may look like I have a tree limb for a nose, but I still have feelings. - I'm sorry. - Especially when I bend over and get my nose stuck. All right. What can I do for you Ash Lad? - We have to find Soria Moria soon, if it exists. - Are you daft? Only one person was lucky enough to return from Soria Moria alive. And if he's still alive, I'm sure he must be losing it. - And where is he now? - You can find him on the far side of Hedel Gorge. - Hedel Gorge? We will never make it there. - There is a waterfall that you can get through, and once you cross it - Yeah? - I forgot. No, oh my, oh my, the ancient Voskramen lives there, and he will try to trick you. - Then what do we do? - I don't, uh, one second. Wait here. I think I have something. Don't touch anything. - Okay. - I wish I lived in a house with just one floor. (wind rushing) (panting) What did I say? That chest contains the souls of my ex-boyfriends. But you're in luck. Because you helped me get free I'll give you these. Every time you take one step they will take you seven league. Better be careful. - Oh, thank you. - Thanks a lot, Stump. Friend. - Ah, you're very welcome Ash Lad. Now, listen closely to me. A few drops from the water of life can heal anything, but taking a whole sip will give you enormous strength for a short while. But only a short while. Be careful. Now get going. (laughs) - Seven league boots? I should've invented these. - Every step will take you seven leagues? - Yeah. - Isn't that kind of-- (dramatic music) dangerous? (Espen grunting) - It's okay. That was just a test. (screams) That's nuts. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - I wasn't asking you. - [Espen] One more try. - [Kristin] Are you sure about this? - Yeah. Third time's the charm. (dramatic music) (bird cawing) (Espen thuds) (Espen thuds) I just died. I'm burning these. Still hurts. - We're gonna have to face the Hedel Gorge anyway. - [Espen] Compared to the boots the gorge is easy. - He'll be back for us. Espen, he'll, he'll get us out. - What if he doesn't make it in time? Remember what the crowd wanted? Throw us in the snake pits with lots of flogging? Cut off our ears. (tense music) (horses neighing) - [Kristin] Hedel Gorge. (horse neighing) (horse whining) (suspenseful music) (horses whining) - I don't like the sound of that. (horse whining) - I can't believe you're our best soldier. We'd have been safer with Stump Woman. See that? - We're not the first ones here. Hey! Steel pot. I can see you. (chuckles) - Come on. (tense music) Where's the waterfall? I think she lied to us. - [Espen] Could be around here. - [Kristin] Yeah, according to an old woman who likes to talk to squirrels. - Hey, I'm sure she-- (thunder rumbles) Oh, I've got a little plan. - I think this is the worst plan ever conceived. - At least we've got a plan. - To find a senile old man who may not even be alive. He's supposed to guide us to a place that doesn't exist? - When we find the water, we'll also find out who poisoned the wine. Then Per and Pal will be set free. Okay? You think they're guilty? (rain pouring) (gate creaking) - There's a visitor here for the cute one. Not my words. - [Solfrid] No, no, no. - Huh? Wait. - [Solfrid] I said the cute one. - [Guard] Not you. - Huh? - The other guy. - [Solfrid] Yep, that one. - [Guard] Yeah. You got two minutes. - Hey. - Hi. - Uh, you see, I baked you a cake. - Thank you. - I know you didn't do anything, but I'm glad I can see you again. (giggles) - I'm so sorry I didn't dance with you. I'm such a klutz. - Oh, no, no, no. I know I can be too much. (giggles) - I'm Pal. - And I'm Solfrid. And I-- - So is that a special kind of cake? - Oh, you bet it's a special cake. - So maybe it contains, you say, some ingredients unusual? - It's got all of the usual, oh yeah, yeah. It's got some unusual ingredients. So chew carefully. - [Guard] Hey, your time is up in there. - [Per] I'll grab this. Thanks a lot. - [Pal] The time went by too fast. - [Per] No, it really didn't. - I'll see you soon, okay? - [Pal] I hope so. - Take care. Don't push me. - Hey, hey! What are you doing, you animal? Solfrid made that cake for me! - Calm down. This cake right here is our way out of this mess. You'll see. (gasps) Ah! A comb? - [Pal] How cute? - [Per] Cute? - [Pal] Mm! - [Per] Come on. This is it. I can feel it. I feel soap? - Yes! - [Per] Your girlfriend smuggled in a comb and a bar of soap. - I'll trade the comb for the soap. Okay? (Kristin snoring) (suspenseful music) (leaves rustling) - Kristin? Kristin? Where are you going? Kristin? Are you okay? (tense music) (haunting violin music) (grunting) (grunting) (screams) (panting) Kristin! Kristin! (haunting violin music) Kristin! Stop! Kristin! Kristin! - Who are you? And how dare you resist the fiddling of the great Voskramen? - Uh, we're just travelers that are passing through. We just wanted to get through the cave behind the waterfall. - No. I'm the only one who decides who can pass here. - Espen, what's happening? - Hey, hey! I'll try to, I'm gonna take care of this. - Tell me. How did you resist my music? When I play every creature starts crying, even the gods. - Well, they cry because it's mediocre, right? - As if you could do better. - Yeah, I could play that fiddle with my feet. - You talk big for a puny human. - I'm serious. What do you say we have a competition? If I play better than you, you let us pass. - Challenge accepted, but if I win your souls belong to me forever. - May the best man win. - [Kristin] Espen, the Stump Woman said he would try to trick us. - I got this. - I'll play first. If you're really as good as you say you are, the best goes last. (upbeat violin music) - That was pretty good for an amateur. - You've got big mouth, stranger. Let's see if you can handle the big stage. (dramatic music) (violin screeches) (creature splashes) (adventurous music) - [Espen] Watch your step. I have a feeling things are looking up. Ow! Okay, not. - Are you okay? - [Espen] Yeah. - [Kristin] Pass me the violin. I'm gonna try something. (gentle violin music) - Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Play some more. (gentle violin music) (birds chirping) - I'm sorry. I know you and your brothers are really innocent. I was just mad. - Thank you. - Come on! We still have to find that senile man. - Coming! (adventurous music) Hey, look what I found! - Hey, what do you have there? - Whatever it is, it stinks. - Let me see. Smelling salts. It's what doctors use to wake up patients after they've fainted. - Might come in handy the morning after a night out. Hello. Are you the one who's been to Soria Moria Palace? (chuckles) - No, not me. I'm too young to be him. But you'll find him in there. (man grunts) (Espen groans) - Ow! Hi. Have you been to Soria Moria? - Go further in. - [Espen] Hi. Have you been to Soria Moria? - Who, me? Oh no. You're looking for the father of the house. (chair creaks) (Espen grunts) - I'm fine. (man snoring) - [Kristin] Good day, are you father of the house? - [Espen] And you know the way to Soria Moria, right? - You can talk to my father there. (laughs) - [Kristin] Excuse me? - Have you ever been to Soria Moria Palace? - Soria Moria Palace? - [Espen] Yeah, have you been there? - Yes. Ask my father. - Oh come on! - He's the old guy hanging from the wall. (gentle snoring) - Oh, are you two my new great, great, great, great, great grandchildren? - Uh, no. We were just wondering if you know the way to Soria Moria. - If I wanna get with Susan Gloria? - Soria Moria. - Oh (chuckles) Soria Moria. I haven't heard anyone mention that place for many years, too many. - But is it true that you've been there? - How do you think I've managed to reach the ripe age of 190 and a half and still going? - 190? - And a half! It was, it was all the water I drank while I was there, you see. I drank the water of life. - Could you tell us how to get there? (chuckles) - This morning I put a spoonful of porridge into my ear, and that's because I forgot how to eat. (chuckles) But it's your lucky day. Because I wrote about Soria Moria in my diary. You'll find it just over there, in the cupboard. - Where? - East of the sun. West of the moon. Look, this is exactly what we need. It even has a map! (man snoring) This looks like we have all we need to find-- - Let me grab this for you. - Your highness. I am Captain Olman, and I'll be taking care of your little kingdom for you. And I presume you are Espen So Sad? Take them! - Stay back! - I got him. Around and around and then pull it through. No, not like that. You have to-- - I said I got it. - Danes. Why did it have to be Danes? (dramatic music) - Come in please. Take a seat. Feel at home and just help yourselves. We have really good food. I recommend the pork shank. It tastes heavenly. - [Kristin] We don't want your food. - Why not? Esbill? A little taste? No? Great, that means more for me. - My kingdom will never be yours. - Sadly the kingdom already belongs to me. But this little gem here interests me now. In Denmark we have heard stories about Soria Moria. But could they be true? The treasures, the gold, and the water of life. - But it's all just a legend. - It could be. But we'll soon find out. - You were the one who poisoned my parents. - You got me. But it wasn't just me, dear. I did get help from someone you know. - From who? (tense music) - I've come to share some very good news for the two of you. Espen and Princess Kristin are on a quest to find Soria Moria. - Then he's still alive! - Indeed, but he won't be getting you out of here. - Huh? - Sven? You're lying. He would never do that to us! - You should be careful about who you trust these days. - Don't take it so personally. These things always happen. Somebody has to take the blame for the greater good to occur. - We're not stupid peasants, you know. You have some nerve! The king trusted you! - Yes, he did. And I like the king. I like him very, very much. I like the royal family, and I'm thankful for them. They're very good people. But you have to know how to play your cards well, and unfortunately for all of us, the Danes will seize power sooner or later. - What you're doing is high treason. - No. What I'm doing is assuring my survival. - Wait, what happens to us? - You two will not survive. You will be rolled around in a barrel of nails. - A barrel of nails? - Listen, it could be worse. At least now you know why you have to die and how. - Not comforting. - And now that you know, I'll be leaving you in peace. - I've been such a dolt. - A what? - She said a dolt. - What does that mean? - An idiot. - Oh (laughs) that's a good one. A dolt. Better write it down, eh? - You dolt. - No, you're a dolt. - You Norwegians have such funny words. I collect them. And what do you call that over there? - Potato. - Potato (laughs) Did you hear that? - Potato. - Oh, okay. And what about those? - Scrambled eggs. - Scrambled eggs? Don't scramble my eggs. My eggs are all scrambled. Have you ever heard such a thing? Okay, okay, what about this thing? - [Espen] That's a napkin. - Napkin? Hey, what do you think of that? So many funny words. Tell me what this is. - A sausage. (laughs) - It's the same word in our language. Get them out of here. - This isn't over Olman! - [Gang Member] Come on, let's go. (grunting) - Now you can say, "I will die, I will die." - Hold up. I say we take them all the way up to the mountain and throw them off the cliff. - No, no, no, no, why would we? We'll just do what she told us to. Cut their throats with a knife and then you know. - I got it. Yeah, we tie them to a tree, cover them in honey so the insects will come - No we don't. - They'll eat them slowly. Think about it. (imitates insects) - Right, that's right. - Come on, prisoners covered in honey. - Or we can just kill them, you know? Just kill them. - True. They escaped. Hello? They're gone! They escaped! - Alarm! - Alarm! - Alarm! - Somebody find them! - Get 'em! (Espen yells) (men shouting) - Can't find them anywhere. - At the camp! - There they are! - I think I see them! - Over there! - Follow them! (suspenseful music) - Search over there! - No, they're not over here! - Find them! - Look that way! (suspenseful music) - [Kristin] Oh my god. - Yeah, ha ha, got 'em! (dramatic music) - Going somewhere? - Here you are! (swords slashing) - It's just a fiddle. - Oh, how sweet. - Play something for them. - Yes, play a little melody. (upbeat fiddle music) - Shiny fiddle. - She plays good. (grunting) - Stop this! Stop! What's going on with our bodies? Stop this! What's happening? (dramatic music) (men groaning) (horse galloping) - What the hell is going on here? - They got away. - How is that possible? - I don't know what happened. We just had to dance. - Dance? - Mm-hmm. - The urge to (laughs) - At least she's in a good mood. - Come on, let's have some drinks while we have a look at the book to see where we're going. - Help! You have to help me! A piece of cake got stuck in Pal's throat! - He'll be executed anyway so. - Right, good point. People will pay a lot to watch it. They really look forward to it, and they even bring their families with them. You wanna disappoint 'em? - [Guard] Their families? - Yeah, we shouldn't mess it up for them. - You know, I never thought about it that way. It would be a shame to disappoint the children. - Right. - So. (tense music) (lock clicks) You go wait in the corner. (guard chuckles) I won't fall for the old "my brother ate cake "and he choked on the fruits, knock out the dog" trick. I've been fooled that way before. (Pal groaning) - [Guard] Hey. Look at me. (dramatic music) (man groans) (tense music) (footsteps thudding) (door creaks) (tense music) (door creaks) - [Pal] Hi. - Hi. Hey! Come back here! (dramatic music) (man hacking) (dramatic music) Alarm! The prisoners fled! They ran that way! (men panting) (Sven coughs) - Hi there. (door creaks) (man panting) What is it? - I'm sorry, sir, the prisoners - Are behind you. - Have escaped. - Yeah. (man panting) Thank you for your report. I was nice. I confided in you, and you decided to hurt my guard and escape. And so you'll be executed first thing in the morning. That's that. Please close the gate. - Your execution is tomorrow. Well, the children will be happy to see you nail it. Get it? (chuckles) (somber music) (inspirational music) - [Espen] We need to get to the island. - [Kristin] Which island? - [Espen] I don't know. I didn't get that far in the book. Good morning. Is that your boat? - Huh? - Is that your boat? - Uh yes. It's all mine. - Could you give us a ride? - To where? - Well, we don't know exactly, but for sure it's one of those islands. Oh, thank you. The diary said something about sun and moon. - Well this island right here resembles a moon. - And this one looks like a sun. East of the sun, west of the moon. Excuse me. - Yes? - What is this place? - Nobody knows for sure. - We want you to take us there. - I won't do that. It's not safe. Only one person's ever made it out of there alive. - Would you be willing to trade your boat for something, something I have. - Depends on what you have to offer me. - Yeah, a man like you with exquisite taste would probably appreciate this one of a kind bird. - Ha, one of a kind. That's a magpie, boy. - Right. But I've got something more precious. This thing. - The boat is yours. - There are advantages to being a princess. - Yeah, you're right. - Let's go. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (water lapping) I don't think we're gonna find our way in this fog. - [Espen] Yes, we will. The sun's bound to come out soon. - I don't know how you do it. How can you be so positive all the time? (Espen laughs) - I'd call it faith. You should try it sometime. - You know, if you would like to visit me more often, I wouldn't mind it at all. - [Espen] You mean that? - Yeah. - (chuckles) I'm not sure your father would approve of that. (Kristin laughs) - [Kristin] When have I ever listened to him? (boat thuds) (tense music) (air whooshing) - Huh? (tense music) (water splashes) Can you see anything? (Kristin and Espen screaming) The ghost of the sea! Get him off me! Steel! He can't stand steel! That was close. - Yeah. - Thank you. - [Kristin] Yeah. - You've got some fight in you, huh, Princess? (tense music) (water bubbling) (screaming) (water swooshing) (waves lapping) (birds squawking) (Espen spitting) (Espen coughing) Kristin! Kristin! Kristin! (water splashing) Kristin! (somber music) Kristin! (adventurous music) (door creaks) (bird squawking) (wondrous music) (skeleton creaking) (footsteps thudding) (tense music) (stone rumbling) (air whooshing) (Espen coughing) (dramatic music) (Espen panting) (door creaking) (dramatic music) - Would you look at that? We're always running into each other, huh? (gang cackles) - Espen! - Oh, how sweet! - I found your belt. - [Olman] (laughs) This is the best day of my life! - Thank you. (speaks in foreign language) - That's Finnish. - Whatever. (shouts in foreign language) (dramatic music) (groaning) (grunting) (tense music) (Olman gasping) - Oh, hello, ladies! (Espen screams) - Comrades! Little Norway is not big enough for me anymore. With this kind of power, we'd be able to take over the world! - Yeah! - Imagine a Danish kingdom that stretches all the way from Copenhagen to the very shores of Constantinople and I, I will sit on the throne. (gang cheers) (gang laughs) - [Gang Member] Olman! - Huh? - Huh? - [Olman] What's happening? (gold jingling) (ground rumbling) - I heard something. - I'm so hungry. - You're always hungry. - Back hurts. You smell something? - I can't see anything, but what is that sweet smell? - I smell sweet humans. Delicious, crispy, crunchy humans. - [Olman] Hey trolls! - Woman. - Oh, I'm really scared. I'm the strongest human on the planet. - Who are you? - I'd like her in a sandwich. - I eat trolls for breakfast. (trolls laugh) - That tickled! - I really wouldn't do that if I were you. - Why? - Because the powers don't tend to last. (Olman giggles) (Olman screams) - Sucker! - Let's celebrate with some (trolls roaring) (door banging) (everyone coughing) (tense music) (gang snoring) (footsteps thudding. - I think the humans are over here. - Why do we always have to go your way? - Shut up and-- - The water's more important. I smell two more. (trolls sniffing) - We need to get to the water. - If we only had our eye we could see them, and then we could eat them. - Be quiet now. - Guard the water. - I'm so hungry! (trolls grunting) - Hungry, hungry, hungry! - Me too! I'm so hungry! - Do you think the king will get to know how clever we are? - Will they give us our eye back? - Yeah, we deserve it. (metal clanging) - Did you hear something? - Guard the water. Guard the treasures. They're here somewhere. (tense music) (metal clangs) - Ah! Who are you? - Yeah (sniffs) there are two of them. I can smell them. - Don't let them steal the treasures. - We are not here for the treasure. - If that's the case then why are you here? - Because we need the water of life. My parents were poisoned, and I need to save them. - They are going to steal from us. - Yes. - Not so. I'm begging you. - No. You don't understand. If we don't guard the water we'll never get our eye back. - Let's eat them and fill our bellies. - Hold on. I might have something for you. - I know that smell. What do you have there? - Give it to us! - Here. This belongs to you. - Can it be true? - Is it really our eye? - Is it? (trolls gasping) - We can see again - We can see again. - The king and the queen, the parents of Kristin, they are dead. But with all that you have, you three can save the kingdom. - All we want is a few drops of the water of life. - We will give you some. - Wait a minute. I think he smells heavenly. Let me sniff. Shouldn't we rather eat them? - No. We have our eye back. - Thank you so much. - Go now, go before I change my mind. (trolls laughing) (townspeople booing) - Pal? Pal! - Wait, set them free! - Papa! - No, let my boys go! Boys! Let them go! They're innocent! - Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! - No, no, no! - No! (screaming) (Kristin and Espen screaming) (water splashing) (Kristin and Espen screaming) (adventurous music) (Stump Woman panting) - Huh? (birds squawking) - Did you hear that? - No. (adventurous music) - Oh, not again, good for nothing nose. (drum beating) - I'm delighted to see so many children and families here today. So, we will finally have some painful and spectacular entertainment. We hope you enjoy watching the agonizing death of these two peasants. (crowd laughs) Thanks a lot. Please be respectful and let the children come closer. - I'm scared, Per. - I am too. So long, brother. (Pal whimpering) - Who wants to have some painful fun? - [Townspeople] Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! (dramatic music) - Roll them! (Pal laughs) - Espen! - Espen! - Per and Pal are innocent. Advisor Sven is the one behind all of this! (laughs) - That is a fat lie. Put that boy under arrest. - Arrest him! - Arrest him! - Arrest him! - Arrest him! - Arrest him! - Arrest him! - No, my sons! - Arrest them! - You had a plan? He'd just confess? (crowd cheering) - No, it's just bad. - So, this time we'll skip the drum roll. We get it. And roll. Ready? Push them over! - [Crowd] Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! Roll them! - Stop right there! You will set those brothers free now. (brothers laughing) - Papa! - Your majesty, it's so, so good to see you. I think I was maybe, maybe we could find a way to work together and (screams). (dramatic music) (crowd cheers) - [King] Dear people, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support. - This is for you. Happy birthday, Kristin. - I can't believe you. - It's not much, but uh, it belonged to my mom. - It's perfect. - It is? - Yeah, thank you. (king clears throat) I wanna stay with Espen. If you have a problem with that I give up my right to throne now. - Espen Ash Lad, once again you have proved how much you are willing to do for this kingdom. And if Kristin wants to be with you, who am I to hold her back? (queen laughs) Why are you laughing? - [Queen] Because you're sweet. (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) - I'm sure it's only puppy love. Surely it won't last. (king and queen giggle) You're with me on that, right? - No, this love will last. - Cato, was I talking to you? Move on. Hide your face. (crowd cheering) Hurray! Long live the princess. Hurray! It's so touching, - So. - Young love is permanent. - uh, uh, and uh. - [King] Oh hey, it's not that kind of gathering. (crowd cheering) (adventurous music) (Espen sniffs) - Sorry, that's just rubbish. There are certain limits. But it's nice. Still, you can't pick up things like me. - [Kristin] Are you scared I'll be better than you? (Espen laughs) - [Espen] I know you'll be better than me. I don't know if you can find great things. - [Kristin] Well I found you. (dramatic music) - Do you think it's safe to come out? (lid creaks) - Ouch! Look. Look all around you, Nicholson. It's ours! We are the richest people in the whole wide world! We are rich beyond our wildest dreams. - [Troll] Finally. (men screaming) (troll laughing) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (gentle music)
