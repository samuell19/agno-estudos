CHOTARD GROCERY WHOLESALERS - Good morning Mr CHOTARD! - Good morning, Mr de Castaillone! - Good morning CHOTARD! - Good morning! Good morning Mr CHOTARD! I don't have to say good morning to you. - Are you being attended to, Madame? - Yes thank you Mr CHOTARD. - Somebody serving you, Sir? - Yes. - And you Madame? - No, I'm waiting. Emile, see to this lady... Hurry up! Can I help you with something, Sir? - A knuckle of ham. - Hurry up... someone to the deli counter! Hello... is that the station? Is that you, Mr Chipe? Would you take an order... 500 kilos of sugar, to be delivered before this evening. That's fine. Goodbye Mr Chipe! Hello... slowcoaches?! Has the truck arrived? Did you send us the notice? Did you get the notice from the depot? I've got it right here. So everything's in order. Yes, I'll send a truck. Adele! Would you be so good as to answer the phone! I need to be on top of everything! Alright? I forgot, Sir. Just do it! I can see you all don't start doing anything until I arrive! In future you'll do piece-work, instead of by the hour! Good heavens...it's midday! I've told you before, Augustine, we sit down to lunch at 12 sharp! It's 2 minutes past 12. And I don't want you talking back! Understood? Answer me! I was about to. And let me say right now that if you go on flirting with the staff... ...I'll dispense with you! I've told you before, Augustine, to keep the lid on the mustard! - Where's the lid? - It's lost. - Well, replace it then. - There isn't any. I have 2,000 pots of mustard in the store, and I don't have a lid? I sell mustard to the whole district, and I don't have a lid?! I guess that must be a new joke! Sit down, Marie. And tell Reine to come. - She's finishing her scales. - So I can hear... unfortunately! Her teacher says she needs to do them to stretch her fingers. Couldn't she just as well stretch them with a polka or something? That'll come later. By then, we'll be in the loony-bin, from listening to her scales. You'll probably be first. Did Reine go to the town hall? - I don't want her to go alone. - Why not? A number of reasons. Just pass me the mustard. What reasons? She could be followed on the street. And there's her cousin Edmond. I don't want a policeman as a son-in-law! He's a lieutenant. 13 francs a month for the piano. Do you think that's reasonable? - Who else is there? - There's the Collinet boy. Collinet? What Collinets? Which one of them? He's the son of that former justice of the peace. I'm told he writes poetry . I don't want either a policeman or a scribbler here! Understood? It can't be that difficult. - Wine? - No, water. Got to keep your schoolgirl complexion! And have everyone chasing after you! Enough of that, Francois! - Bread? - No, some crackers - So you don't get fat! - Exactly. So you have a provocative figure! Just eat, Francois! There still could be the Courtois son, from the new galleries. I'd say wait, we'll see in 5 years. But a lieutenant? Who needs to have two stripes to show he's a lieutenant? Never! Have a slug of wine... that'll hit the spot! - From the boss's cellar? - None of your business. And as for these poets who don't know how to write like everyone else... ...and who don't matter to anyone... I don't want any here. I won't change my mind about that. Reine... ...you'll go to the town hall this afternoon, to get my birth certificate. And if anyone follows you in the street... ... without you noticing, you'll do me the favour of looking straight ahead. Pass me the pickles. Yes, this is the police. A serious accident? Very serious? We'll be there shortly. Hello there, commander! How are things, Ducat? Fine, Commander, how's it with you? It's alright. What about that marriage proposal? Made up your mind? Would you believe it...? I don't dare! Come on!... you've got your 2 stripes! I'm well aware. I thought you were supposed to speak yesterday. Yes. And then at the last moment, I got cold feet. You don't get anything if you don't ask for it. Yeah. So what? What's the big deal? None, I guess. Isn't she getting the best of the arrangement? I guess so. So, when will it be? Well I'll make it tonight at the Trade Ball. I'm decided... I'll use the occasion to talk to CHOTARD. That's the spirit! Can I say something, Julien, my boy? You're good for the Prix Goncourt, let me tell you. You're joking! You mean ME?! But why not? When someone has what it takes, sooner or later they succeed. It'll happen! No one understands us here. The bourgeoisie trample on us. This isn't our world. And to think you've a crush on the daughter of the biggest wheeler-dealer in town... ...of the most backward... ...of CHOTARD, of all people! Reine is a lovely person. What does that matter in the life of an artist? - For a poet, love... - ...is to write poems about. Or a novel. But seriously though... do you love her? Yes. And if I go to the ball tonight, it'll be to tell her that. Fancy-Dress Charity Ball - Raffle Buy a toy, Sir... for the little orphans! Buy a cushion with a highway map on it! All hand-embroidered! Useful as well as decorative! It even shows level crossings! Very interesting! For the little orphans! A box of Turkish cigarettes. Good evening Mr CHOTARD! Good evening Sub-prefect! Good evening, Mr CHOTARD. Good evening Mr Spaguerre. Who's that important-sounding individual? What?! You don't know CHOTARD? CHOTARD? Who's CHOTARD? The town's big wholesale merchant. Well, well! Remind you of something? Everything! - Good evening Mr CHOTARD! - Good evening, Miss! Good evening! - Who's he? - Mr Patin... The manager of the Mesart branch. Didn't you recognize him? Isn't that silly of me!? I'd say so. You can talk! Emile... Go and see if the balloons have arrived. Don't fool around with your dress... it's embarrassing! Good evening, Cousin! Good evening, Cousin! Good evening, Commander. I came to keep you company for a little while. He's going to talk to Reine's father. Let him do that. You get busy with the girl. Then everyone will be in control. I can't get to talk with her... She's with her parents. Don't worry... At the first dance, I'll handle it. So, still nothing doing in the police department? That's to say... it's like...! Apart from that, what's new? So you came to the ball! You too. Me too. Well, everyone was invited! Reine is quite charming this evening. - Does that interest you? - Oh my goodness! That is to say... that... without going so far as to... - Very much so! - Listen, my friend... Let's continue this conversation some other time! I'm waiting, as you know... I assure you... it's important for me... I assure you... Goodbye for now... D'Artagnan! Good evening, Mr Cassagogne! A glass of champagne, please. So be it. A glass of champagne. Take it easy, Ducasse! I'm so happy being alone close to you! - But we aren't alone! - I see no one but you. Careful with my feet! I'm unaware of this crowd. - You mustn't bump into people! - I'm in heaven! - At least keep an eye on the ground! - You're all I need to be happy. - Truly? - My hope, my joy! Careful, people are looking at us. Without you I'd rather die! Later! Dance in the meantime! You mean so much to me! I'd climb mountains for you... I'd brave death 100 times. You're making me dizzy! - I'd break the law for you! - Oh, be quiet! I'd renounce my parents! You have such amazing hair. Your mouth, as well... ...and your arms, and your shoulders! One more dance for now is enough, don't you think? Let's go out to the garden. But it's too dark! Exactly! The night and you, the shadows of the trees, what a setting! - Are you quite serious? - Absolutely! He's going to watch out for us. Fear not, Madame... If Daddy or the policeman come by... ...I'll split their skulls with my battleaxe! It's great here. - I'm afraid, Mr Collinet! - Of me? Of my parents, mostly! You think that it would really upset them if ... What ARE you saying, Mr Collinet? Why? Is there something bad about us doing this? I'm not saying that, but you know how it is with parents. Has anyone told you how beautiful you are? Perhaps... but never in this way... You do feel I'm sincere don't you? Well I hope so. What a truly beautiful evening! A bit chilly perhaps. How about that? Yes, that's warmer, for sure. We're alone with the stars. Let's hope so. I asked Parpaillon to keep watch. That was a good idea. He can really be trusted. Well it seems we're being badly guarded! - Your voice arouses me. - It does? Everything you say caresses me like a song. Is that a poem you wrote? Why, do you like it? If it's yours, I love it. Truly. Cousin, they've gone! Who? Reine and her dance partner. - Did you see them, Marie? - Oh, it's lovely! - What's lovely? - Yes, it's lovely! She's crackers! But I'm telling you, they went out... ...into the garden! Into the garden?! Come on, Marie, we'll see. Probably getting some fresh air. Perhaps I haven't quite understood... ...but listening to you, I felt you were sincere. You fill me with joy! Half of it for me. We'll see each other every day! Almost. - Twice a day! - I'd do the impossible! - Nothing can ever separate us. - I hope not. - Nothing and no one. - No one. Yes! Me! - Get away! - Stay there! So this is what you call dancing? Abusing my daughter in public! And compromising her in everyone's mind! - But we've done nothing! - You go with your mother! And tell her to watch you! And as for you, Sir... I can assure you that this incident will have consequences! You're dealing with CHOTARD here! I'll make you understand me, and have respect for my child. And please do NOT answer me back, or say what you were doing here! I'll speak to your father! The shame of it! The dishonour you've inflicted on her! And all your explanations will amount to nothing! You're nothing better than a lout! I'll see you at 6 tomorrow in my office, to give you a piece of my mind! I'll be there! Come in! Thank you, Miss! Sit down! Thank you. So... where are we at? I don't know, Sir. I've spoken to Reine. It seems she loves you. - Really?! - Yes, unfortunately! - I hoped so. - So you do too? Yes, Sir. Anyway it is important to make a decision! I'll marry her! Well, exactly what is it that you do for a living? - Poetry. - Poetry!? That probably doesn't give you any health problems? A bit of a cold, that's all! Because here, we work! How does that affect you? - I'm prepared! - Up at 6 in the morning! - 5 o'clock if I have to! - We even work Sundays! And festival days as well! - For me, every day would be a festival! - No days off! She'd make every day a holiday! Trucks to load, customers to serve, accounts to check, errands to run! I feel I'd enjoy that very much! Well now you know the program! Yes, Sir. You may go. We'll see. Thank you, Sir. Him, or someone else?! NUPTIALS The marriage has been announced between Miss Reine CHOTARD, daughter of Mr Francois CHOTARD prominent wholesaler in this town and head of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr Julien Collinet, no profession, 7 Rue de la Paille We extend our compliments and best wishes to the young couple and their families - Tell me, Julien... - What? You saw the flowers in our wedding basket? Beautiful, weren't they? They're to be thrown out. Isn't that usual? They're all withered. So...? What should we do with them? At least keep one of them. This is what they're like! Save one for me! Why? - Don't you understand? - Not really. What a shame! Are you ready to go downstairs, darling? What for? To the shop, of course. Then what? You know Daddy insists we're first in the shop, to set an example. He who must be obeyed! Come on, hurry up... otherwise... Otherwise what? We'll be late that's all. Just hurry up! Just don't plan to make a scene about it! I wasn't planning to do anything! Go down, and don't say anything stupid! Late as usual in this household! Emile! Are you the boss? Yes or no? - Yes Mr CHOTARD! - I'm sorry... I am! - Good morning, Daddy! - Good morning, pet. - Good morning, Dad! - Yes, okay, okay! Good morning, Emile! Mr. Bernard, would you prepare the cash book? Come on... get to work! You've no time for acrobats! If you want to see the circus, go on Sunday! Excuse me, Sir... Excuse me, Sir...!! Yes, Madam? Half a pound of ham. Only half a pound! How much is that? I don't know. It's usually 12 francs for half a pound. Then 12 francs it is! Which would you like? Those ones. Take some, kid! Those ones, too. Off you go! All OK darling? I think I've got the finish for my novel. Would you mind the cash desk for 5 minutes? As you wish. 15 francs for this lady. Here's 50 francs. What is it Miss? What about your fan? I've already told you that it doesn't work! So it'll need to be repaired! So 25 and 25, 50 and 50, 100. - You've made a mistake. - I'm sorry! - 50 and 50 makes100. - I gave you 50. And I gave it back to you. So what's the complaint? You're giving me too much! You keep the 50, and we'll call it quits. Get the hell out of here!!! Go and check off the loading. Whatever you wish! I do beg your pardon, Madam. Here we are... 15 and 5, 20, 30 40 makes 50. - Thank you. - Sorry... goodbye. Where are your luxury items? I don't know, all I do is check the loading. Luxury items this way, Madam. Th boss told me to check off the loading. Is this it? All you do is find the cashier number.... ...and mark it with a cross. God, it's hot today! You still taking a rest! Another stuff-up like that, and I'll do something I regret! What happened to Julien? I sent him to check off the boxes being loaded. Here, you sit back here. No, I've things to do upstairs. Adele, would you come and do the cash desk? And don't give change for 100 for a 50 note... ...like our pretty-boy did. Oh no Sir! Are you there? You'll get a turn... You just need to blow. Good grief! Are you quite finished?! God almighty! Come back here! I'll catch you! - Where's your husband? - I don't know. I'm looking for him. - You want the truth? - What's happened now? You married a lunatic, my pet! Don't be like that, Daddy! If you ask me, he's totally useless! That's what I think, and that's what I say! It'll all come to a head by autumn! I'm sorry to say... but I'm sure of it! - At least he's never beaten you? - Not yet, thank heavens! Don't worry, that'll happen! Why do you say that? If someone gives change for 100 for a 50 note... ...they're ready for the loony bin. - He did that? - At the cash desk! Ask him how he counted the sardine boxes! Like all people who do nothing, he's an idiot! He could kill your mother, in a fit! Don't give me that! Never! Just you wait... You'll see! Julien! Julien! - Good morning, Mr CHOTARD! - Good morning! Why so glum?! When I think... ...that we rejected that cousin, for Reine to get that good-for-nothing... ...I really wonder. I'm forced to say to myself... "you made a bad decision!" Of course you did. But you know I'm a very good decision-maker! Of course I do. Has the lieutenant come to see YOU? Oh no! He's got a crush on the boss's daughter, you know! But she's married. All the more reason, my dear! With my strength and his brains, I thought we'd be complimentary! Now I see he's got no brains at all! - I thought the same! - And you were right for once. Can I help you? - Hello, sweetie. - Hello, Sir. - You OK? - Yes, OK. Well, well...! Here's your cousin. Hello Ducasse, how are things with you? Good to see you... come on in, old chap! Tough luck my friend! If only we'd known! Are you well? You should have really INSISTED, old man. Things not going well with the scribbler? You don't have to rub it in! Well, it WAS your fault. I still have no love for policemen... ...but if one has to choose between a lunatic and a policeman... Yeah. I'm on my way to the officers' academy... I'm hoping to be returning as a captain. Captain? How fine! I just called in to say goodbye. It's sad to see you leaving. I'll only be away 3 months. If you're tenacious... ...you may well find that things have changed. They can't go on as at present! A change of son-in-law? Well, maybe later... But if you come back as a captain, I can promise you compensation! But keep it to yourself for now! Wait and see! "Captain" ...not bad! We'll see. We'll see! Just repeat everything I say, and we'll always agree! Good on you Edmond! Goodbye for now! - Goodbye cousin! - Goodbye! All the best! Just make sure you don't catch cold! Julien! What on earth are you doing there? Looks like a good spot... a regular strongroom! How's the world of commerce? Getting there. Nowhere. Well, nowhere is somewhere! You aren't happy here... Admit it! I get by. I just overheard a conversation in the shop... ...between CHOTARD and the policeman. Not interested. Where's "Pretty-boy"? Don't bother about him. In my house, we eat at mealtime! And we eat with everyone else! And I'm not in the habit of waiting! For anyone. He expects to be fed... ...yet turns up late at mealtime? Julien! I'd best go, before there's another scene. Wait for me. I'll try to bring you a little bit of dessert. Thanks for the thought Julien, but please don't bother! But Reine, even so...! I just wish you wouldn't shout after Julien! That sort of thing makes me very unhappy. You think crying will soften me up? Never in my life have I seen anything like this! Thank you. Do I just turn up to eat? Where did you learn your manners? This is neither a bedroom nor a reading room! Get it into your head... this is a respectable household. Where we work honourably... I earn the bread that we eat. Today we're a region-wide business... This was achieved solely through my initiative. I give this business all I've got! Let's eat. Do I spend my time on balderdash? Scribbling rubbish on a piece of paper? Is that any sort of decent trade? You have a daughter, raise her, indulge her, pamper her... Because we really did pamper her, didn't we, Marie? It certainly wasn't all for the sake of the likes of you, Sir! So can I in all honesty allow this farce to continue? To that I can only say no... I can't and I won't! I'm master here! That's all now, Augustine. I don't like confrontations, but I need to be respected. If you're not inclined to work here, you can find someone else to feed you. Somewhere like Montparnasse ...or with the girls in Montmartre... but quickly! This is the last straw! Look! This is that last straw! That breaks the camel's back. You have to ask yourself... ...what gave his father the idea of bringing him into the world. You can't let weakness get the better of you. Have a sausage, Marie. Hello, Julien my boy. I heard all that rumpus in there. What's going on? You were right. I can't stay here. Really?! What about your wife? - Come and we'll pack our bags. - No, Julien, listen... no! This is a serious decision... wait... - It's too late... I'm out of here. - Just think about it! I guess you've no choice. Literature Prize The annual Goncourt award The day of glory Does this Collinet come from here? He's Chotard's son-in-law, Sub-Prefect. CHOTARD the grocer? That's the one. That's really wonderful! I live nearby! We went to the same school! We were in the same class! So was I. Waiter, could you find me a bag? Yes Sir. I'll go call in on this Collinet. Don't cry, Reine. He can be found. Do I have to take any more of this?! Enough! I was saying that to console Reine. Reine doesn't need consoling. She has to stop thinking about it. I love him, all the same. No one loves a lunatic, my girl. Besides, Julien was always very sweet to me. Maybe at night... even when he was asleep. He used to say pretty things to me. And all he did for me was make me miserable. You're both quite unfair to him. - You talk back to your father? - I don't like the way you're talking. So you run off... but come back without him. What? You're taking her photo? Yes. He's left! Scissors. Thank you. Looks like Mr Collinet is leaving. Just mind your own business, and get back to work. I'd like to see Mr Collinet, please. - Who shall I say? - The sub-prefect. Come with me, Sir. 5 percent off brooms. Off brooms. 5 percent off biscuits. Off biscuits. 40% up on essential oils. You have to know how to make sacrifices. So what do you want now? The sub-prefect wants to see Mr Collinet. - The sub-prefect?! - Yes. I'll be right there... pass me my jacket. We have to fight the cost of living, every way possible. Thank you. Good morning, Sub-prefect! Good morning. So everyone's happy? My word, we're all happy. And you're happy, too? As you can imagine! In that case, everybody's happy! Please sit down Sir.... I say, wasn't it a triumph?! What was? Have I been decorated? No. Your son-in-law... Mr Collinet. My son-in-law was decorated?! Haven't you heard the news? What news? You haven't seen the papers? No, not yet. Well read this!. He's probably killed someone. Mr Julien? A telegram for Mr Collinet. Hey! Hands off! He won the Goncourt?! Well, how about that! But what is the Goncourt, exactly? So, this is him? It's marvellous! But this is good news! Extraordinary! - And it's true? - Rest assured. Today's paper is certainly interesting. So Mr Collinet, really is your son-in-law? My wife and I have that honour. Excuse me, Miss... could I see Mr Collinet, please? I'm telling you... I'm looking for him. There's a lot of people in the vestibule, waiting for Mr Collinet. Yes, I'll see them later. Just find me Mr Julien, alright? I haven't found a trace of Mr Julien. Just get to it and tell him the sub-prefect is here to see him. Alright? I'll have a look in the shop. And do me the favour, Augustine, of wearing a white apron. He probably hasn't got over the excitement of it all. Unfortunately! It's a wonderful achievement. And what might it bring? Needless to say, in this field, on is above money. Pretty high then?! Appropriate. Incredible! Es esta la casa de Senor Collinet? Pardon, Mr Collinet is here? I'd like to speak to Mr Collinet. I'm so sorry I couldn't congratulate him personally. I'll certainly pass your wishes on, Sir! You see, I'm very fond of creative people, They're special! But they're often abandoned to an unfortunate fate. It's incredible, believe me! After all, art is beautiful! Beautiful?! Believe me, it's beautiful! Deep down, there's a poet in all of us! Upon my soul, why not?! You're a poet, in your very own way! I do wonder about that, you know! We were all a toddler... we all had a mother... Good Lord, so long ago! We've been many! Brothers, sisters, friends! All gone! Dead! Be happy! Be proud! Your son-in-law is a star! But I did have my doubts, you know! Do you want to see the paper, Julien? No. After you, Sir! Tell him we expect him for dinner tomorrow at the prefecture... ...and we'd be honoured if Mrs Collinet were to accompany him. They'll be there, you can count on it, Sir! Thank you so much! I'm from 'La Depeche'. Can I speak to Mr Collinet? I need to interview Mr Collinet for 'Le Matin' Mr Collinet isn't here. We're looking for him. But I'm his father-in-law. Chotard's my name. Goodbye gentlemen... Miss! Hang on! Go and get dressed! Why? Here, read this... then we'll talk about it. He gets 10,000 francs given to him? Sh! Come on... Excuse us, gentlemen! 10,000 francs! Need I tell you how he raises our status?! - It was me who chose him! - Excuse me! It was me! - After all, it was Reine! - So why did you say it was you? We shouldn't have made any promises to the captain. - Who promised? - You. - Let's drop the subject. You were saying you never wanted to see Julien here again. If you'd understood me, you'd have said the opposite! - You can say you're sorry. - How would I look? Best you do it. - What on earth is going on? - Look at this, Reine! On the front page! With a photograph! In bold letters! "A revelation." The subtitle bold too... but not as heavy. "Julien Collinet receives the Prix Goncourt." You're kidding! The rest is just words... it's all in the headlines. - That's Julien there? - How handsome he is! You called him a lunatic. So don't always listen to your parents. - Are you sure this story's correct? - It's 'Le Matin'... a serious paper! - Excuse me Sir... - Is Mr Collinet in? I couldn't say. It's not my concern, Sir. Enough with all these questions...! goodbye gentlemen. I couldn't find Mr Julien... He went to the station to catch the train to Paris. The station?! My car! Emile... quick! Well, you kicked him out. What a to-do! What are you doing with that wheel? Had to be greased... Did you think I'd appreciate that? You're fired! That'll teach you not to service the car just when I need it! Your truck's got 4 wheels... Drive me to the station! Step on it! Can you tell me when Mr Collinet was born? I don't know. What can you tell us about Mr Collinet? Whatever you want. Can you tell me how he spends his time, during the day? Monsieur Collinet? He doesn't do anything! Come with me! Wait...! There we are! Come on! No argument! What's this all about, Mr CHOTARD? What's it about? You ask what's it about?! You shmuck! It's about your friend winning the Prix Goncourt! This'll be Collinet! Emile! Emile! - Emile! - Yes Mr CHOTARD? Have all the doors guarded so no one can come in! What for, Mr CHOTARD? Don't ask questions, just do as I say! So, can I hug you? What for, Sir? Enough with the "Sir"... After all we're family! What's got into you? Come now...! Try to be understanding. I rose from nothing... ...and when you rise from nothing, something in you stays unchanged! Why this turnaround? Can I help it that you've won the Goncourt?! - I've won the Goncourt?! - You've won the Goncourt! Squeeze me! Come along! Marie! Marie! Julien's staying with us! - Reine! - Mummy? - Julien's not leaving, now! - Justine! Mr Julien is back! What can I tell them now? Hang on! Off you go... Go on! Julien! Now you're a big-time guy! - You think so? - I know so! - Ouch! - Famous! - Really? - Aren't you proud? - Heavens, no! - What would it take to make you proud? - To be happy! - Aren't you happy? Not right now. - Where are you going, darling? - I'll be back. Thank you! Julien... are you coming? No, I've got a splitting headache. Well, go and take an aspirin, Come on, my dear! But what are you doing in your bedroom? Resting. But you know they're waiting for you downstairs? I'll be down soon. Just now I'd like to be alone. Alright? - You're not angry, are you? - Of course not. - You're not sick? - No, I'm not. I can't come in? I'm just asking you to leave me be... Nicely. 'bye, darling. "He's a great poet", the sub-prefect told me... ...and personally, I've no doubt about it! Hello Mr Collinet. No, I'm CHOTARD... but CHOTARD and Collinet is the same thing. Aren't you cute! "I have come..." to bring you "...to bring you..." the compliments... No they're not compliments, they're flowers. Fetch Reine! There's another bunch here for you, Marie. Julien! Julien! My respects, Ma'am! Would you have seen Julien? He's in his bedroom. He's got a bit of a headache... ...which is understandable, with everything that's going on. Besides, it's always the organ you work with, that suffers. With me, it's my feet. Stand back everyone! Well now, my dear Julien... here is our new agreement... I made inquiries... ...and I've learned with pleasure that your book publisher is ready to accept... ...all the material you can give him! And at a high price! 5 or 6 books a year would not bother him! - OK by me! - Fine! As a result... ...I'm asking that henceforth you don't set foot in the shop... ...and devote all your time... ...even at night, if you like, to writing masterpieces for us. Let's see now... How many pages a day can you give us? Oh... I don't know... ...let's say 2 or so. How about we say 25 pages. Far too much! Oh, what's 25 pages? It'd be a breeze! I could write more than that in my spare time! But that would hardly be the same thing! - I'm talking quantity! - What if I get tired? Don't be silly! But I have to have ideas. Everyone has ideas! What if I get sick? We'll get the doctor to come and give you some shots. But it's just not possible to write all the time! Yes, it is! Adele, I want you to round up all the staff so I can talk to them. I've worked out you could give us 10 books a year. And with the contracts proposed to me, that'd be 200,000 francs. For an artist, that's good money! Yes, but 10 books is impossible. Come on, Julien... don't be modest! You've name is a brand now, as as such, will sell itself! And besides, we'll do everything we can to make your life pleasant... and quiet. We'll lock you up in the garden tower... ...with instructions that no one is to disturb you. Not even your wife! Happy with that? Not at all. Come, come, my dear Julien, you're not going to be difficult?! We all must contribute what we can. From now on I'll be making sure that everyone is worthy of you. First of all, me... I'll be reading everything I can. And I'll try and understand it! Pay attention, all of you... ...who know nothing at all about literature. Being the know-nothings you are... ...I'm advising you to get to know my son-in-law's novel. Because we don't have the right to be ignorant of what's good. Come here, Emile! Distribute these books to all the staff. Back to work! It's long, isn't it! Hi there! Oh! Hello, Lieutenant! No, my friend, no! Didn't you notice my new stripes? Very sorry, Lieutenant! "God in Heaven, I'm ready to testify here..." "...on the common law that wanted it excepted..." "...so that a very different care troubles and devours me." You haven't got very far, you know. "Madam! It is not too late to trouble you again!" "Maybe your spouse still sees the light!" "Though he is dead." "Thesee is a place that would suit you." "Your soul is forever kissed by his love!" "Yes, Prince, I languish, I burn for Thesee!" Come in. "I have..." Come in! You're cousin's here. Cousin? Greetings, everyone! Well, so here you are! I'm back from the officers' academy as you see. Already? I've been promoted. Good for you! I get an extra 500 a month. And it's us who pay the taxes! I'm about to get an apartment. It'll be really, really good. 5 rooms! Do you have some children already? So what's the story on "Pretty-Boy"? I'll ask you to be polite! Come now, Francois! I was referring to Julien. What? You haven't read the news? What news? That we've won the big prize, would you believe! I' sorry, but I was in the camp at Carpianne. You don't read the papers? I was in training. For you, all that matters is strength... violence... conflict! What about idealism, poetry? They count for anything? No... irrelevant! Irrelevant?! So that scribbler has become a great man? Listen, I don't want any arguments. Got it? Goodbye now. You mean, you're showing me the door? We'll see you for coffee on Sunday. Alright, Edmond? Goodbye! No, but whereabouts is Collinet? Down there, Sir. He's working. - And while my son-in-law... - OUR son-in-law. While MY son-in-law is writing masterpieces... ...we'll strive to initiate ourselves into classic beauty! Because it's good! You may have your doubts about it, but I am telling you it's good! - Not only good, but true! - I agree! And as for Reine... ... she shows herself completely worthy of a husband she loves! And we are enjoying happy days! Out in that garden tower... ...things are really happening! So nice of you... The laureate of the Prix Goncourt savoured, in the peace of his provincial retreat... ...the joy of his recent and resounding success. Supported by the affection of family and the respect of all his fellow citizens... ...the celebrated young novelist is preparing... Get to work! Write, my darling! You have to do it! We want 200 lines a day, and all will be well. But I just can't do it! I'll brick up your doorway so no one can disturb you. But I can't stay locked in here! You can come out on Sunday! Write, Julien! I promised Madame de Bericourt that you'd give a talk at the chateau. I won't do it! Next week you'll be speaking at the town hall. I'm not going to do it! Don't be like that, darling! Write, write! - The title of your next novel? - I'm not writing anymore! I promised to tell Caprio where you're up to. Tell him anything! Calm down now...! We'll be back this evening. I beseech you to leave me alone! I don't want to be locked up here, forced to write! I just want to live a normal life! With you harassing me from morning to night, I can't do a thing! I just need some peace, that's all! This reception of yours is delightful! And what a good idea to precede our friend Collinet's lecture... ...with a musical interlude! I nice little bit of music, isn't it? My daughter had these people come down from Paris. It really adds something to the occasion, doesn't it. Can we expect a new masterpiece, soon? That's quite possible... I hope. One of a series, no doubt! You have to strike while the iron's hot! Writing comes easily to him. 100 lines a day doesn't bother him at all, Your Ladyship! He's a new Balzac. That's indeed quite possible, Sub-prefect! You're a lover of Balzac, of course? Do I love him? Of course I love him. But I can't hide the fact that I prefer Victor Hugo! You'd know his works as well, no doubt? Is that so? "The Man Who Laughs". That's right! I like something that's humorous! Mr Julien? Hello, Augustine. The guests have been waiting in the salon for you, for 2 hours. Oh, they'll be patient. Half of them have already left. Well, let the other half leave. What about your talk? After I set up a carafe and glass of water for you. I'll do it later. The prefect is still there. "Long live the Republic"! - Do I have to lie? - Probably. Mr CHOTARD doesn't know how to hang on to those people who are tired of waiting. So let them go to sleep. So exactly what am I supposed to tell them? Goodnight, Augustine. Instead of eating, you'd do better to go find your friend. No way! I'd just get rebuffed. You must excuse me, my friend, but I really must leave now. Oh, wait now, Sir... He's sure to come. A little patience! Goodbye, Sir. I trust we'll have better luck another time. I do hope so, Sun-prefect. ...and thank you, all the same. You're more than welcome! - What's the matter? - The matter is, they've left! Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Sir. - Heart - Ace of spades - You, Jules. King and queen gone... I play jack and 10. That's it, eh? You don't want my queen into the bargain? Excuse me. My deal. Someone going to answer that phone? Forget it... We'll answer it when we've got time. And as we don't have time, we won't answer it. The shame of it! I've never been so humiliated! Don't cry, madame... ...for us who are artists, time doesn't exist. Well I think it's a damn shame... and when I drag him back here by the scruff of his neck... ...I assure you he'll be here for a long time! Calm down, Francois! And I don't want to hear any more from you! Hello, Mr Jannot... Of course, it will be delivered to you tomorrow. You have a right to ask... No, that's always to be feared. Goodbye, Mr Jannot! Was that you, Julien, speaking like that? Yes? Hello... What was that? For a week? I'll take care of it, thank you. CHOTARD, we have a truck-load of sugar that's been sitting at the depot for a week. How does that look?! Have you suddenly gone crazy, perchance? I also noticed that the roof was leaking in the shed in the back yard. Why the delay in getting roof people in? It's obvious this house has been struck by misfortune! Maybe. Emile? Emile! Mr Collinet? - What are you doing right now? - We're playing cards. And I have been reading your last novel. This is my bedside book. It's delightful. Good. Will you now be so good as to close the shop immediately! First thing tomorrow, I want Mr Jannot's order delivered. Send Joseph to the depot with the truck... ...and the sugar is to be loaded for delivery by 8 o'clock. Very good, Boss! What are you doing? Get a move on! What's got into you, my boy? Tell me! What got into me was the realisation you were letting this joint run itself! People weren't working, phones weren't answered, customers were complaining! You were paying people for nothing. Joking apart, is there a new novel? Because, if there's a new novel... ...I'd rather you said right now that it's not to my taste! It is inadmissible that a business as reputable as yours... ...should be allowed to fall apart. What do you say to that? After 40 years of work, don't I have the right to free myself? Come on, these are not things to tell him! Hang up. So I'm not even allowed to read! Or be a poet in my own way? Or daydream when I want? Am I to be dead and buried without having known the classics? But you have a job to do here! I'd happily shut the place down. - You don't have the right. - It's all mine! On condition that you maintain it! Don't I have the right to appreciate poetry? Do I have to be bleached clean first?! Each to his own...! And this is yours, here... it holds the memories... ...of all the things you struggled for! If only you could have spoken like this before! Poetry is everywhere! Workers who labour... walls that are built... ...trucks driving off... a prosperous establishment! There's your true poetry! Well, it's taken you a while to appreciate that! Look what you've built up, brick by brick! Build, struggle, succeed...! Isn't that beautiful? - Do you know what was here, 20 years ago? - No. Well, there was nothing! I started by buying a block of land... 100 square metres. And we had a small handcart! Today, it's 5 trucks... And I'm planning to buy a 6th! - And you have 10 branches! - 16, my boy, 16! And you'd give up all that? I don't know... what can I say? I just don't know! One can't do everything! And I'm not young anymore! I want to learn! Make up for my schooling! When you have a son-in-law who has learning... ...you get the ambition to know something, too. But it takes all sorts to make the world. It's the blend of them all that's beautiful! How about you... What are you going to do? I'm going to help you! But the books...? You have contracts! I'll write them... on one condition. Yes, with sons-in-law, it's always the same... They join you with their tail between their legs... ...and before you know it, they're running the place! We'll each do our job in the way that suits ourselves. When I want to write, I'll write, and I'll help you, as needed. But you'll give me Sunday off to read, alright? Sure... why not?! Listen, just between ourselves... ...if only you'd said this earlier, we'd have cancelled that session! Reine is most upset, and it's understandable. And I don't like my child to be upset. Relax, everybody... I'm here to rejoin you! I say... there's champagne and sandwiches downstairs! - I'm on my way! - No, wait here. We'll take a little aperitif! Cheers everybody! And when your novel's finished... ...bring it along... ...and just between ourselves, I'll tell you what I think of it! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
