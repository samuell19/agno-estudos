(crickets chirping) (deep tense music) (dogs barking in distance) (slow eerie music) - [Vivian] Don't worry, Zach. (slow mysterious lullaby music) (Zach coos) See, Zach, everything's okay. Yeah. (slow mysterious music) Sh, sh-sh. (glass shatters) Aaron? (glass shatters) - [Aaron] Almost done. (slow mysterious music) (creature growls) (slashing) (Zach squeals, cries) (mirror shatters) (haunting music) - Zach? (gasps) Oh, god. No! (sobbing) No! (screaming) (gentle mysterious lullaby music) (creaking) (Papo cooing) - [John] Opa. Oh, yeah. Okay. Hey. - [Rachel] There it is, my little prince, it's your kingdom. Here we go. (gentle inspiring music) Hey, buddy, this is your room. Hm. (Eli cooing) Yeah, these are all your new friends. You gonna say, "Hello, jaguar. Hello, alligator. Hello, giraffe." Oy. Asleep. - You ever have one of those moments, just like you imagined it? (knocking at door) - This little kid sleeps through anything. (chuckles) (cooing) - Hi, uh, Schoenberg? - It's Guerrero. Ah, yeah. It's my mother-in-law, that explains it. Schoenberg's my wife's maiden name. I can sign. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. - There you go. - Great. Thank you. - Oh. All right. Hey, Papo, wanna say hi to baby Eli? Hey, Papo, look. It's your little brother. Yeah. That's Eli. We gotta look after him, yeah. - It was my sister's stuff. - Toys that, uh, belonged to a baby who... - Who died. - I'm not superstitious, I'm just saying. You know, what happened to her son, and the whole accident with her husband. (Papo squawks) (Eli cries) What happened? Papo scare you, huh? Oh, come on, let's get you over here, put you down. Okay? Yeah. (Eli cooing) (ticking clock echoes) Papo's a friend, Eli. It's okay. (Eli coos) Yeah, it's all right, buddy. (book creaks) (ticking clock slows down) - Got your ear. - Oh, my god. - And I got your nose. - Look at this. It's got writing on it. It's got music. It's Hebrew. All right, Hebrew school, let's put you to work. (John chuckles) - Got jokes, all right. - Yeah, come on. See what you got. - Um... (John speaks Hebrew) It's like a prayer, but not. Hm. Hang on, I got-I got something for that. (Papo squawking) - That's good. You need a cheat sheet. See, you probably don't even speak Hebrew. I think I need to call my mother. - Wow, wow, I mean, I think what you mean to say is thank you, my love, for getting my mother off our backs and proving your undying love for me and Judaism by converting, maybe? - Thank you, my love. - Mm-hm. - What was it again? - Mm-hm. Ah, look, here it is. It's a zemer. Yeah. - Right. (clears throat) It's a zemer. - Mm-hm, zemer, it's like a hymn, a religious song, also like a lullaby. It's actually beautiful. - It's classic Vivian. - Can you make out the tune? - Um... (Rachel vocalizing) (telephone rings) Okay, we don't need a lullaby. (telephone rings) Hello. Thank you. Yeah, he came out so cute, the little munchkin. I can't even tell you, he's like a perfect little soufflé. Um, hey, so, right... Where are we on reservations? (gentle somber music) You think this is too easy? - We got this. - You know, I bet I won't even need the full month. (Eli crying) - Oh. (Eli crying) (car horns honk) (Eli crying) - Please, Eli, just work it out. - Okay, I'll take him so you can, uh, get ready. Come on, buddy. I'm, oh, let me get this first. - I know. I know. - There we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. All right now. (Eli crying) - Yeah. - I can't do this. I can't-- Look at me, I'm a freaking mess. I can't, I can't, I can't go in like this. I've had, what, 45 minutes sleep this week? - Okay, all right. - I can't, I can't do it. - How can I help? - I don't know. The restaurant was also my baby. (Eli fussing) I just feel like it's slipping through my fingers. (Eli fussing) - Okay. (Eli coughing) Okay. Okay. Up, up. - Oh. - Up, up, up. - Hey. - Rach, love, I saw you build that restaurant, okay? - Yeah. - It's not going anywhere, okay? - I know. - You're amazing. - Well, I'm amazing at that 'cause I know how to do it. I just, I don't know how to do this and that at the same time. (Eli fussing) - I have no doubt. (Rachel sighs) Oh. Okay, look, um, I'll call the gallery. I'll tell the guys, oh, you got my-- did you get my nose now? I'll let them know that I'm gonna stay home. - I'm not even gonna-- - It'll be me and you. - No. No. - Yeah, me and Eli. - No, no, you can't. This is your biggest exhibition ever, baby. - Oh. (Eli cries) - You gotta go to the gallery and make sure your psychedelic chicken is on point. - It's a phoenix. - Well, you know, at least one of us can rise from the ashes. (John chuckles) I'm gonna stay with you. - We're gonna work it out. - Yeah? You sure? - I got pretty close to getting out the door today, buddy. - You did. You certainly did. - I did. I got close. - I did. - You'll need that. - We're gonna work it out, buddy. Get outta here. Get out before it's too late. - Okay. - Hi. - All right, we a team, we a team, we a team. - We a team, we a team. Yeah, we totally a team. We got it. Oh, god. (Eli crying) Yeah. I, uh, I thought we agreed on white truffles. - [Woman On Phone] What? - On white truffles. Sh, sh. Yep, but you're still gonna sit down. You can cry about it. Hi. Hey, baby. Oh, this one, oh, look, it's fun, it's fun. Be happy. (Eli cries) Look, look at the bird. Look at the bird. Yeah. (Papo squawks) (Eli cries) It's okay. Look. (clapping) You wanna clap? You wanna do this? I just need five minutes, okay? Okay? You're a good guy. Yeah. You're a good guy. (Eli cries) Please, I just need to poop. Eli. (Eli cries) No, don't eat that, don't eat that. No, don't eat that. No. That's right. We're gonna-- Oh. Okay. Okay, we've got this. Clean? Vivian, Vivian. Vivian? Oh, Vivian. Thank you, sis. Gold up in here. (Eli cries) There's some gold up in here. What is that? Look, what's that? (Eli wailing) (wailing continues) Stopped crying. It works. (Eli fusses) Is that a little bit of drool? (foot thuds) (soft eerie music) (indistinct distant whispering) Oh... Johnny. (Eli crying) (Papo squawks) (Eli crying) Sh, sh, sh. (Eli crying) (Rachel sings softly) (Eli stops crying) (Eli cries) (Rachel sings softly) (Eli stops crying) (mirror cracks) (Rachel sings softly) (mirror cracks) (crickets chirping) Baby, you did it. I love you so much. (wind howling) (ghostly voices whisper) (door latch opens) (John sighs) Hey, honey. Can you hear that? - I hear... absolutely nothing. - Not a peep. Not a snort. Not for hours. (John sighs) It was the lullaby. - Ah, your, uh, your sister's book. - Mm-hm. - So, you were able to read my translations? - Mm-hm. It, I don't know, it put him right to sleep. (both sigh) - Thank you. - How is this even possible? You just got in the door. - Ah, baby puke. It's inevitable. (towel snaps) Hmm. (gentle mysterious lullaby music) (zipper opens) Oh, uh, your dress is unzipped. - Really? Oops. (gentle mysterious lullaby music) (baby monitor buzzing softly) (baby monitor crackles) (baby monitor crackles) (scary startling music) (tense haunting music) (door squeaks) (deep tense music) (baby monitor crackling) (baby monitor thuds) (Papo squawks) (metal grinding, tinkling) (Papo squawking) (knock) John? (Papo squawks) (Papo squawking) (steady knocking) (tense scary music) (exterior door handle ratcheting) (Rachel gasps) Fuck this. (mirror cracking) (soft eerie music) (Rachel groans) Mom face. Great. (mirror cracking) (Papo squawking) (tense suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (shower door opens) Guess who's still asleep? - Elias Samson Guerrero? - Yep. - What a good boy. - Yeah. (Crone growls) - Shit! (scary music) Rach. Rach. - It's fine. (sighs) - Look, I'm sorry. I saw-- - You don't have to apologize. You had an honest reaction, that's just life. It's what happens. - Hey, no, look-- Wait a minute. - We need a new baby monitor. I'm gonna be back soon. (door shuts) - Hey, Papo. Hey, buddy. (Papo squawks) Hi. Yeah. Hey. How you doin', bud? Yeah. I know. Yeah, hello. You're not mad at me, are you? Look at yourself. (Papo squawks) (speaks Spanish) (Papo squawks) What is that? (Papo squawks) Huh. (people chattering) (monitors crackling) (creature growls) (monitors crackling) (echoing knock) - Okay, let's get outta here. Hello? (Rachel breathes heavily) (scary music) (Rachel cries out) - Are you okay? (haunting music) (mirror cracking) (Papo yells) (thunder claps) - Stupid bird, I swear to you... (Papo squawking) I'm gonna make a pillow outta you. (Papo squawking) (baby cries in distance) (thunder crashes) (electricity buzzes) (baby crying in distance) (panting) (thunder rumbles in distance) (baby crying) (Rachel shudders) (baby crying) (Rachel gasps) (Rachel whimpers) (Rachel gasping) (door creaks open) (scary boom) (Rachel gasps) - Hey. Hey. Hey, what-what's wrong? What happened? What happened? - There's, I think there's someone, there's someone in the apartment. I-- - What do you-- what do you mean? - So, so, okay, so there was a blackout, and then I-- There, I think there's something or someone, I-- - Did you call the police? - No, I didn't. I-- I didn't. (thunder claps) (Papo squawking) (thunder rumbles) (Papo talks indistinctly) - Hello? - [Papo] Hello. (Papo squawking) (thunder crackles) - If someone's in here, come out. (metal rattles) Hey! (Papo squawks) (thunder crashes) - [Rachel] Baby, is everything okay? - Yeah. Stay in the hall. (Papo squawking) (thunder rumbles) (John breathing heavily) (Papo squawks) (John grunts) (Papo thuds) (John gasps) Oh, god. Oh, shit, no. No, Papo. No, no, no. Papo. No. My mom got him for me. Had him since I was 11. - I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Don't be. It's not your fault. I did it. (eerie music) (John sighs) - I, I'm... I'm not okay. I'm trying really, really hard to be okay, but I think I'm not okay, I think I'm... I think I'm actually losing my mind. I mean, Vivian lost her mind, she tucked her dead baby into his crib for, like, two weeks. - Rach, you're not Vivian, okay? You know, we're just... stressed. Parents of a newborn baby. - I'm seeing things. I'm seeing this woman, this old, hag witch woman in the darkness, in the mirror, in the freaking baby store. I'm going-- (chair clatters) Well, I suppose, wife's going bat-shit crazy, that's how I'd react too. - No, Rach, you are not going crazy. Did you see-- Is that what you saw? Did you see something like that? - That's her. That's her. - Yeah, okay. The other morning, in the shower, same creepy image got in my head. - Right. So, we're just, what, like... sleep-deprived, freaking cabin fever-- - Yeah, probably. Most likely. Yeah. - But that's not what you believe. No, you, no. We're seeing... Come on, we're seeing-- - Look, Rach, I believe in us. Okay, that's all. Whatever this is, whatever's happening, we're gonna get through this. Together, okay? We a team. - Yeah. Yeah, we a team. - Yeah, and this is going where it belongs. - Yeah. And Eli's sleeping with us tonight. (baby crying) - Baby's crying. (John sighs) I'll get it. I'll get it. You sleep. (tense suspenseful music) (baby crying) Okay. Okay, buddy. (door closes) (baby crying) I'm comin', Eli. I'm comin'. (baby crying) (door slams shut) (baby crying) Eli? (baby crying) Eli? Eli! (baby crying) What the...? (baby stops crying) - Hey, hey! (scary bang) You steal from me, man. That's bad karma, man. (door clicks open) That's bad juju! (door clicks shut) (slow mysterious music) (Eli crying) - Hey, do you have an alarm snooze-- snooze button here? (Eli crying) (Rachel sings softly) (ghostly voice echoes) (Rachel sings softly) (ghostly voice echoes) (eerie music) Eli? (baby crying) Eli? Eli? Eli? (baby crying) Eli, Eli. Eli. (scary whooshing) (baby cries) Eli. (baby crying) Eli. (scary music) (Rachel screams) (panting) (Rachel gasps loudly) My baby, my baby, my baby. (Rachel laughs with relief) Yeah. - Yeah. - You gonna be okay? - Absolutely. We're long overdue for some father-son bonding time anyway, right? In the meantime, Eli, he says he wants you to relax, okay? - Okay. Thanks Eli. - All right, bud, here we go. Opa. (sighs) - Let me get that. Okay. I love you. - I love you more. Bye. (slow haunting music) - Hi. - Hello. - Vivian Brown, please. I'm her sister. (birds chirping) (door clicks open) - Hey, John. And the little monster. Hi. Hey. Hi. (laughs) What's happened? (exhales sharply) Do Jews have exorcists? - Come. Sit. (slow somber music) (John sighs) (birds chirping) - Hey, Viv. (slow somber music) - Hi, Rachel. - Can I sit? - Of course. - Rachel's sister, Vivian, came to me with the same story, the same questions. - Vivian did? What did you tell her? (scoffs) You thought she was crazy. - Mom sent your stuff, from storage. - No. No, no. No, no. I locked that stuff up. Mom-- Mama should not have done that. - I found the lullaby book. - Did you sing from it? Rachel, listen to me. Zachary was taken. I sang that song, and she came and she took him. - Who came? Who is she? - Lilith. - Lilith was the first woman made by God to be Adam's wife. - They would lie together in Eden, and he would sing her a song. It was their special song. And whenever Lilith heard that song she'd come running. She loved Adam, but she was a strong woman and she refused to submit. - The legend says she was banished from the Garden of Eden by God. She roamed the wilderness. She lay with wolves. And gave birth to her own race of imperfect creations. - Deformed, hungry, half human, half-- half something else. Lilith saw Adam and Eve and their perfect babies, and then she looked at her own broken children. And that's when she started stealing their children. Our children. - And so it went for generations, until God listened to the prayers of Adam's progeny, and he sent her to the underworld. - You know the word lullaby comes from Lilith-abi. It means "Lilith begone." Mothers sing lullabies to keep Lilith away. But Lilith, (chuckles) Lilith took her and Adam's song, their special song, and she twisted it. She turned it into a lullaby that does the opposite. It summons her. I sang that song, and she came. She took my Zachary, and that corpse they found that had been dead for who knows how long, that-- that was not my son. I can help you, Rachel. I can help Eli. I need to help Eli. - How? - You have to get me the fuck outta here. - Rabbi, this woman, Lilith-- - She's a myth. What I'm telling you are legends, fables used for lessons and guidance. - Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here. Lilith, she's in your stories, your fables. (scoffs) I'm telling you, something's happening. - And I wanna help. - Then help. There has to be something. A-a-a prayer you can give me. I don't know, something. - That isn't how our religion works. - Is this what you told Vivian when she came to you looking for answers? - There was nothing I could do. (Rabbi Simowitz sighs) (John sighs) (eerie music) (music fades out) - Rach, we're home. Hey, bud. What do you say we get out of that, huh? And now we go opa. Oh, yeah, we're not gonna forget this thing, right? Yeah. (chuckles) Yeah, huh? Rach? (water splattering) Shit. Okay, buddy, I need you to hang here, okay? Opa. There we go. You have the toy. Okay? Just for second. Shit. Shit. (faucet squeaks) (door bangs shut) (deep foreboding music) (Eli babbling) (Quad Lilim gurgling) (Eli giggles) (Eli babbles) (Quad Lilim grunts) (Eli giggles) (glass shatters) Shit. (water splattering) (soft haunting music) (glass clinks) (dramatic boom) (tense music) (Eli screams) - What, you just-- you left him? - What? No, I just-I just put him down for a second. The-the bathroom... Is he okay? Vivian. - They're here. (eerie music) Lilith's servants. We cover mirrors after funerals so our departed loved ones don't stare at us from the afterlife. So it is with Lilith. I thought that breaking the mirrors would work, but this is better. This is right. - Right. - Isn't she supposed to be in the psych ward? - Maybe. - [John] So you thought it was a good idea to bring your crazy sister here? - [Rachel] Don't talk about her like that. - [John] Maybe this wasn't a fire that needs gasoline, Rach. - [Rachel] I just thought after everything we've been through and experienced and, you know, the book was hers. She-she-she lost it. - Exactly. She lost. She lost her baby. She lost her husband. She lost her mind. - I didn't lose my baby. That thing we buried was not my child. Lilith took my little boy and her Crone killed my husband. - I thought a mirror fell on him. - You don't have the luxury of skepticism, John. Not anymore. You sang her song, and now she is coming for Eli. - What's the plan here? I mean, but how-- how do we protect our son? - Don't take your eyes off him. And if you see her Crone, run. (telephone rings) Come with me. Let's finish. - Hello? - [Man On Phone] I understand you have a book. - Who is this? - [Man On Phone] Your rabbi said you need help, John. Get a pen. - You're leaving? - There's something I have to do. - Don't worry. We'll keep Eli safe. (Elevator arrival chime) (engages lock) I see congratulations are in order. - With everything going on, I... I don't think I've even told Johnny. That came so easy. (Eli fusses) - What is it? - No, this thought just comes into my head sometimes. I don't even wanna say it out loud. It's a horrible, horrible thought. What if this is the universe's way of telling me I'm not fit to be a mom? No, Rachel, no. Don't you dare question that. This, this is exactly what she does. She gets inside your head, makes you ask if you deserve to be Eli's mother, makes you lose faith. You can't let her take that bond away. You are his mother and you always will be. I always loved this lamp. I'm glad you kept it. - Hey, where did the lullaby book come from? - Nowhere exciting. Little antique shop in West Nowheresville, Maine. - Why didn't you throw it away? - Because it's real. Because it proves what happened. (deep somber music) (horn honks) (deep somber music) - It's Shabbes. - Oh, right, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I'm looking-- looking for this address. - The Dybbuk Man. (other man spits three times) (deep somber music) (siren blares in distance) (crickets chirping) (pounding on door) (pounding on door) (John sighs) - Unbelievable. (sighs) (door clangs) - Rabbi Cohen's waiting.

(Rabbi Cohen mumbles) - My wife's parents didn't speak to her for months when she got her tattoo. - This is not classical Hebrew, but neither is it modern, probably from a middle period. - Oh. Well, see, it's-it's pressed. Can't be older than late 15th century, I'd say. - Mm-hm. Good. These tattoos are not the only reason I'm going to be unwelcome in a Jewish cemetery. And as for the phone call, with what you're facing, God will understand. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (creaking) (ghostly grumblings) You sang this song to make your child sleep? - My wife did, yeah. - It's a clever trap, tricking you into taking that first step, giving the key that first twist. - First step? - The first of three... rituals. Lilith is close, she's watching you, but the door's not open for her yet. The song is the first ritual, which calls her handmaid, the Crone, and her servants, the Lilim. - Lilim? - Fucked up, mutant babies. - Mutant? (scoffs) Okay. (eerie music) (door creaks) (Quad Lilim hissing) (guttural sounds) - The second ritual is a blood sacrifice of an unclean beast to profane your home. - Wait, right, uh, what-what kind of rabbi did you say you were? - The kind that saves your son. Have you had any animals that have died lately? Pets, that sort of thing? - Yeah, I had a... a cockatoo that died. It was an accident. - A parrot. That's unclean. - What's the third step? - The third step is you have to spill the baby's blood. - Well, that's not gonna happen. - Neither would sacrificing your pet. Don't you see? The harbingers are subtle. They manipulate. They live to open the door for Lilith. If Eli spills one drop of blood, Lilith will come and she will take him, and she will leave an imposter, a golem, in his place.

Lilith cannot come into holy light. You must do these things until the first light on Shabbes. Then, and only then, will Lilith be driven from your home. - So, it's like splashing some holy water and saying the Our Father? - Wake up, man. This is about saving your son. Tell me, John, why did you convert? - Love. And my mother-in-law. (scoffs) - Unfortunately, Lilith isn't that easily fooled. She can tell the difference between apathy and a true believer. Take this. It professes your faith, John. Lilith is strong, but she's not as strong as faith. And that's something you're going to need to muster.
