What's the point? What do you mean, what's the point? I've got 10,000 subscribers. What do you think? If we make videos together, we'll have 50 thousand, 100 thousand. I swear, there's good money. Your intentions are clear, Serhat. You want to make money off me? Darling, I'd do anything with you. I'm in love with you. My wildflower. But the point is to do something together. And you're going to like it. I'm serious. Dreams, influencer. Reality, nurse! Look who's there. -Who is it? -It's fate, love, come. -Someone important? -I know them. I know them. I swear it's them.

Who do I see here? Mr. Umut, right? The funny stuff, jokes and stuff. Influencer. Influencer? Not a influencer, bro. Video producer. Love, this is Emre. He makes videos too, but he has fewer followers. Did you come together? No, I hitchhiked him off the road. Love, got it? He's the one with the sense of humor. He got it. What are you doing? How are you? Brother, you see. We're busy. Let me introduce myself. I'm Nurse Serhat. A cold, a flu, a burst spleen something happens to your appendix, contact me directly. I'll be offended if you call anyone else. Thank you, nurse. By the way, Nurdan is my partner. -We're making couple videos. -Hello. Hello. What are you filming? Anything? No, we created a vibe here. We're going to film something about the school. -Nice. -Spring festivities events. Let us help you. We can be in the video. What do you say? Yes, have us. Wouldn't it be more fun with us? Good idea. I think we should do it. Here, brother. You film us. -Nurdan, let's take you over here. -Okay. -You go over there. -Okay? Let's start with Nurdan. -Fix your hair. -Is it done? Fix your hair, stand up straight. Okay, just a second. I'll turn it on. You know the saying? Build your house from bricks, get your girl from Muğla. While seeing the sights of Muğla, we found the beauty of Muğla. Hi, I'm Nurdan. As you can see, the girls here are beautiful. Which is obvious by me. All right, love, come here. Aphrodite lives here, they say, it's this girl. Come to Muğla and feast your eyes and hearts. We've already feasted ours. We'll use that. That's good. Right here. Okay, good. That should do it. -Sorry. -Brother, thank you. You've got real talent. -Good shot. -I don't think it's good. I don't like it at all. Your nose is a bit big. I think we should do another one, and I'll be in it, okay? Serhat, come on. We have to make more videos. Come on. Come on. I had 10,000 subscribers, I'm down to 9,000. Influencer needs influencer's likes. I'll help you when I become one. What do you say? Brother, you want to be a influencer? Yeah, I'm funny too. I make jokes and stuff. I've got the looks. I'm handsome. I'm better-looking than you, Umut. What's wrong with me? Yeah. Wait, I know what you're missing. Wait, I'll be right back. Stop! Wait! Are you filming me now? Cheers. Let me... There he is. Get out of the way. I've found what's missing, come. Serhat, there's something missing. I have this. You use it as you see fit, brother. What is it? What am I supposed to do with this? It looks good on you. Guys, can I have your attention for a second? I need a word of advice. Now, I'm sure. I have two types of timber in front of me. Which one do you think is the best sculpted? The one with the handle or the one without? Don't you fucking film me! Jerk! My little nurse got famous! Go on, you've soiled your pants! Come on, nurse! -See you. -Stop looking at them! Give me. How did I give the wedge in the nurse? He can't be a influencer. He already has a nice profession. He can keep doing it. Nurse! Come on! Oh, woe is me. Look, they've got me. I'll bury you, you spoilt influencers. Look at me. I look better from right profile. I swear to God, I'm going to tear you apart. You'll see. What should I do? They've embarrassed me. Emre, she's a cute one. Come to your senses, don't be ridiculous. I'm bored, let's go. What did I say, man? I just said she's cute. Did I say something bad? Umut. -Umut. -What? Come here. -What is it, man? -Mr. Nurse. You think you're hot shit cause you have millions of subscribers. I'll bring your ass down with this wedge. When I'll put this wedge in your hand, you'll commit hara-kiri. Then I'll give you a dick, you'll commit hara-dicki. They'll cancel you from social media! Cancelled! Where the fuck do you end this? You've being too hard on him. I didn't do anything. What is it? What are you watching? We went to a university event here. We were working there. Then a nurse came out. "I'll shoot with you! I'll add subscribers, help you out." We had a bit of a laugh with Emre. He felt bad, started slandering us. -He started a campaign, you see. -Come on! He's trying to get a followers. MENTEŞE PUBLIC HOSPITAL It worked! The channel took off! I got 11,000 subscribers, uncle. Channel took off! I don't understand, who took off? I'm burying a influencer, uncle. I'm putting on a show. I'm making influencers jump up and down. You just lay there. What is an "influencer"? There is something called social media. When you reach a certain number of followers, you become a influencer. What is "social media"? Now there is this thing called the world wide web... He fell asleep. When the hell is he going to die? Our hotel has 46 rooms. Two of them are suites. Good. And what are hotel pools normally like? Chlorinated or something. Ours is salted. It's organic. -What do you mean? Sea water? -Yes. Come on. It's seawater. Ezgi, there's something on my mind. Everything's fine, but it's like we're the only ones in the hotel. Yeah, it's not open season yet. I've got special permission from the mayor, we'll talk. -Special for us. -Calm down, hold it. You've become a jerk. Why is she showing the hotel? Is she going to sell us the hotel? Why do you attach so much meaning to things? She's just doing what she feels like doing. What did I say? We'll hang out for a day or two, shoot a video. If we don't like it... -We'll scram. -Uh-huh. I'll show you to your rooms. Wait! Do you like your room? The room is marvelous. Postmodern, the design... You've done marvelous things. I mean, there's a great vibe in this room. Yeah, it's got good chemistry. It draws a strong current. Yeah, some legendary chemistry. Like Bunsen burners everywhere. There's this great vibe. Have a seat. I've got some work to do, we'll talk later. Okay. -Umut. -Yes, dear? I hope you find peace and joy here. I'll do for sure. Maybe you'll say a prayer for my father who bequeathed me this hotel. Why should I pray for no reason? We lost my father this winter. Sorry, I didn't know. I apologize. May he rest in peace. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you, Umut. Wow. When people see me, first thing the ask is to shoot a video introduce a place, always these kinds of things. But she wanted something so simple. Only asked for a prayer for her late father. That's real love, that's a good child. A prayer! She didn't ask for anything! She wants a prayer! Come on! What have I done! Just a prayer! Umut! Turn the fucking music down! Turn the music down. Man, what happened to you? Are you dead? Life's so cruel. I'm worse than dead. Enough already. Man, get the fuck up. -What happened? -What did you say when came here? "She's trying to sell it to us." But all she asked for was a prayer for her father. This girl is a good person, Emre. All right, come on, get up, get a hold of yourself, man. -How can I do that, man? -Dude, get the fuck up! For God's sake, look what's going on here! Miss Ezgi! Miss Ezgi! Miss Ezgi? These are for you. From who? Umut, Emre. Oh! Can we put the rest in your room? -The rest? -Yes. All for you. Oh! Here you are, brother. Thank you very much. Thank you too, Umut. And it was nice to meet you. I subscribe to all your accounts. I follow you. Thank you. Nice to meet you, too. Come here for two minutes, let's sit down. Will you be staying long in this hotel? Shall I bring you and Brother Emre some big cacti for your room? Absorbs radiation. What radiation? What cactus, man? Lightning struck this hotel last year. There are magnetic fluctuations here. What's with the cactus? It absorbs the radiation. Where did you learn that? From the documentary networks. Scientists say it. -Oh. -Yeah. -The thorns. -Of course. They absorb the radiation. My pretty girl. Did you watch the video? How did I cancel the dumb and the dumber? Cancel them? You're in way over your head. I don't like it, it's not right. But, wildflower, we got 2,000 new subscribers. Channel's at 11,000. Heading for 12,000. Don't call me before you're 100,000, Serhat. Your channel might take off but it's not getting me high. Jerk! She gave me a subscribers goal to talk to her. Anyway, it will be fine. How old is this tea? Last year this time, my father fell ill. I wasn't here for the hotel very often. And lost my father this winter. It made me very sad, of course. With the hospital bills and everything. I'm ashamed to say, but I'm deep in debt. They've mortgaged the hotel. I have to keep my father's legacy alive. Ezgi, I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you, Emre. Thanks you. Let's leave these unpleasant topics. I have a very nice surprise for you. Sister Nadire. Our specialty. You've got weed and shit all over the table. Eat this. -What is this auntie? -Saraylı, son. Sarıyer? This is the Muğla Saraylı. Sarıyer pastry? Saraylı! Saraylı! Muğla Saraylı. Mongolian Sarıyer patty? What Mongolian, son? It's dessert, just eat it. Eat! It's Saraylı, the brother of baklava. Why don't you understand me? Eat up! Eat it! Eat up! Okay, Sister Nadire, thank you. -I'll handle it. -Don't eat it if you won't! Eat or don't eat it! Why won't you eat it? They got on my nerves. What kind of presentation is this, Ezgi? Isn't she cute? Everyone here is like that. Yeah, she's cute. -I'll get you some coffee. -Yes. Let's eat Mongolian Sarıyer patty. Eat up! Eat up! Eat up! The patty absorbed the auntie's voice, man. Auntie is the patty. Ezgi? Are you all right? I'm fine. Something flashed in my mind, an idea. But I'm thinking out loud. Now... We'll sort out this hotel's problems together. And then we'll be partners. But you keep running it We'll just try to attract customers to the hotel by shooting videos here. How would that be? I don't know, sounds great. Right? I think it'd be marvelous. Win win. You do your job, we do ours. And how is that going to happen? That's a formality. Don't think too much about that. We'll sort them out later. What do you reckon? What would your answer be? Umut, you know how I feel? I'm this a little girl on my knees crying. And you take me by the hand and lift me up. You didn't prove me wrong. The love of millions was not in vain. Thank you for the kind words. But my priority is your comfort. And if we can do this and you won't lose your father's inheritance, the hotel. Right? Oh, cutie pie. Thank you. Oh, my God. Umut, you're driving me crazy. You'll bury us in this mortgaged-for-two-million hotel? We'll pay mortgage, and be partners here? Come on, man! Emre, you're thinking too simplistically and emotionally. But that's not the case. You know what's on your mind now? Umut sees the pretty girl, sends the money's pouring in. But that's not true. It's purely commercial. Come here, let me tell you. Tell us. Two million liras is nothing for this hotel. We paid off the hotel, and we started rolling in money. We'll no longer worry about what video to shoot, what content to produce. Click, second branch. Then we'll make the cake bigger. Once we have the power in our hands, no one can stop us. Click, fourth branch. Click. We have expanded abroad. We wanted to show ourselves abroad. First branch in Ibiza. Click. We're back home, you missed your mum. While we are in Bandırma, let's open a branch there. Click. The first branch in Bandırma. Man, this business is so profitable! What am I telling you? -Click. -Click. Your profession is... I've been in this profession for 25 years. You think we just sign and take the money. No one realizes how big our responsibility is. Miss Ezgi, good luck. Thank you, Mr. Hasan. Good luck. Thank you. Wow, we're going to do stuff together. We're a businessmen now. No fuss, it's Mr. Emre now. Of course, I'll say Mr. Emre. -Brother Umut! -Brother Emre!! What's up, guys? How are you doing guys? -Good. -It's going well. You come to Akyaka and not shoot any videos? You're so right and we're dumbfounded. You coming here and not making a video, I don't know... Don't call yourself an influencer. Then we should all go to our new hotel together and shoot the first video with you, huh? -Yay! -Yay! -Mother, please. -Mother, please! To get permission for us to make a video with your kids. Hello, dear followers. This activity has survived from ancient times. Requires wisdom, agility and endurance. The sack race!

Brother Umut, what are you doing? I'm so sorry, okay. You hit me in the arm. I'm sorry, I apologize. Greetings to you all from Nurse Serhat's channel, friends. I'll get straight to the point.

A little girl's arm was broken. Here's proof. They committed a documented social media offence. We have to cancel them. We have to cancel them. A little girl's arm is broken. She's being bribed in front of her mum. He says "you", he says "princess", he says "let's do it". Who the hell are you? Who are you? Who do you think are you? Never watch their videos. Never like their content. Their channels never subscribe. If you're a subscriber, unsubscribe. If you care about children's rights hear me the lynch mob of cyberspace. If I shove this wedge up your arse. If I break this wedge over your head. Okay? Don't forget to subscribe to my channel and like the video, friends. Do I turn it off here? Here. Goodbye. Umut! That damn nurse! Dude, he's on video again, this fucker. I saw it. The calmer we are, the higher this bloke goes. Let's go restore his face. Come on. He's gone off the deep end. Don't do it. That's what he wants. Don't give him the chance. Ezgi, how can we not? He's slandering us, what should we do? Ignore him. Who cares about Nurse Serhat? He's trying to make a profit off you. Don't get involved. You're gentlemen. Right, yeah. We're are gentlemen. I mean, we're supposed to be. You're right, Ezgi. Let's make a fun video to sell the hotel. Something cheerful. That's it! Like that. -Come on, something nice. -Beating a man? It's not our job to raid people, Ezgi. Emre, I have a humble question. Have you ever done fireworks before? I've done it so many times. Tell me how this works. Umut, look, you're lighting this from here. And this end goes up my arse? We're going to fire it above the sea, why did you turn it this way? You're giving too much advice, brother. Go, check the camera. Oh, my God. -Emre. -Yeah? I've never done fireworks. I'd like to do one. Ezgi, for God's sake. Leave me alone with my art, honey. Oh my God, give me a break! The camera's okay. Here you go. Start the live feed. Let's go. Man, I have so many new subscribers. Move over. Look, number of subscribers, over 20,000. Views are going in the millions. I don't understand, I'm a farmer. Any damage to crops, property, livestock? No. I mean, to some asses. It won't hurt your crops or your cattle, don't worry. Then let's have the millions. And you're in it for the money, too. -Don't we have an IV? -We do. Great. Let me just stick you with an IV. Mates, we're just a minute or two from our hotel. We'll do a fireworks display here to celebrate our hotel. Stay tuned and wait. Umut's on the phone now. Yes, Emre again put himself at the front as usual. I'm giving the camera to Ezgi. We're doing it together. Come on. Put your finger down and make your wish. Your life will change. I see a huge explosion. It's like a flock of peacocks flying in the sky. It will get colorful and very soon. It's around the corner. Don't be surprised if it happens now. Shall I throw it? You've fired it, you have to throw it? -I throw it then. -What? Are you going to throw it? Run! Is there some water or something? Let's put it out. Look Emre, they are aiming at the boat. Don't let them go on the boat. There'll be such an explosion, everyone will be looking at you. Everyone will be talking about you. God willing. Maybe sooner than tomorrow. God willing. I think it's going to the boat. Did you see it happened? Shut up, woman! Shut up! Fuck your fortune and your cup. Emre, I should kill you now. Take care of the broadcast. Umut, they are jumping into the sea. Run! Go! Why don't you turn it off? End it! Go, boy! People are dying! Don't get it on the phone! I only know backstroke. -Call the ambulance, Ezgi. -Call them, Ezgi. -Call the police, the gendarmerie! -Call AKUT, Ezgi! Oh, man! If I was there, I would've cancelled you so bad. I can still do it. I can still do it. Nurse Serhat cancels them everywhere, all the time. I can still do it. I can still do it. I can do it anywhere. Brother, what did those bastard influencers do to you? Look at this. They've burnt it down. You're all black! Who the hell are you? Jesus Christ, slow down. Don't you recognize me? -Nurse Serhat. 50,000 subscribers. -I don't recognize you. We'll go live with you. -Live broadcast? -Yes. The fortune teller said that, too. Greetings to you all from Nurse Serhat's channel, friends. I'm on the scene now, and there's a victim with me. What have they done to, my brother? Let's put this over you, don't get cold. Yeah, can we get to know you? O yeah. Thanks, I've already eaten. It's a joke, you know, humor. He didn't understand, he speaks little Turkish. Anyway, can you tell us what happened? We were travelling by boat. Yeah, mates, you heard it. They were travelling by boat. Imagine, they were travelling by boat, and then they were burnt and destroyed. They shot fireworks into the air. They will burn the sea and the ocean. And they'll end all water. Yeah, and then what happened? -First fireworks, second your mum's... -Whoa! No swearing on our channel. No swearing! No swearing on our channel! Slow down. Please, slow down. There's some girls in the ambulance. I'm going to go check on them. I wish you well. -I'm cold. -Don't hang out with mutts again. -Okay. -Influencers are arseholes. Okay, bye. Girls, can you give me a lift to the hospital? Hello, this is what happens when you hang out with mutts. Get out of the way, I'll hop in. Sir, it's all on this bovine friend of mine. His first fireworks experience. An accident. Sir, let me put it this way. I've fired these flares. These should have gone vertically, but went horizontally. -I don't get it, it was an accident. -Chief Sir! Chief Sir! They're lying, sir. I have a video. It's all lies. -Sir... -Switch it off, man. -I won't turn it off. -Please turn it off. -Don't shoot me. -Don't do it. What happened? -I apologize, sir. -What's wrong? You gave it to my hand? Sir, please. -Don't shoot. -What happened? You gave the wedge to me? -Turn it off! -Come over here! Don't touch! No contact! I'm a nurse in this hospital. What are you? Did you study medicine? Are you a doctor? What's the matter? Did you hear that, sir? They burnt the boat. -Pirates. -Why don't you go and put in an IV? -Why are you filming people, man? -What do you care? -I'll have you thrown out of this hospital! -What do you care! Stop it! Brother, that's not cool. You've got the gendarmes behind you. We're from the hood, too. You see us calling our brothers? -Don't make a scene tonight. -Brother. How old are we? Are we children? You're a security officer, he's a security officer. What's the difference? You were not enough? Not cool. It's a real shame. Look, the one who made you do this is filming a video upstairs on your left. He's using you. Wake up, you're a man of the people. I thought you were getting me fired. We saw who got who fired. You bullies! Bullies! Young bully! I'll hand you over to social media. Dude, come back to reality. Come down here. What? What did you say? I can't hear you, Umut. I'm at the top, I can't hear you. We've given him enough material. You know why? Because you're "dumb". You idiots! Get the fuck out! Get out of the hospital! Bullies. Get the fuck out! Get out! Not cool for you for letting him get away with it. -Go on. -I'll change my knickers and come back. I'm freezing, let's go. He's still staring at me. Son of an ass! Move! Look at that neck. It will feed two families. Get down over here! Lose some weight! We've been getting too much abuse. -Boy... -Go! Slippers. Throw me that slipper, will you, security? My slippers. Up here. It's not over! This is not over! I'm going to wipe these jerks off social media. Who gave you permission to set off fireworks? Who did you tell in advance? During the day, they broke children. They burnt a boat on the evening of the same day. They burnt down a whole boat. In the book of the social media, just to get clicks... Look, I'm making my point here. Is it okay to slaughter people just to get clicks? Oh, my social media folk? I'm talking to the subscribers of these two idiots. Unfollow them with a click. Save your honor. And now I appeal to my own subscribers. We have passed 50,000, heading towards 100,000. Those who unfollow these friends, please do not forget to follow me. Take care, bye. Umut, I knew it. We weren't going to get into this, man. Click. First branch. Click. Second branch. You see the clicks? I feel most sorry for that flower boy. Why? The kid thought cactus absorbed radiation. Dude, is that what this is about? That's not true. The same kid said "Lightning struck this hotel last night. There are magnetic fluctuations," he said. I wonder if that's it. I don't know, we should ask Ezgi about that. Let's go to sleep. I'm exhausted. I'm done, brother. -Umut! Emre! -Let's go. Guys, quick. You're being lynched on social media! -Who? -Cameras, phones, quick! Who's lynching us? A-ha! Hello, friends. We didn't assassinate anyone. We did not commit murder. It was an accident. It really was an accident. Don't let anyone accuse us of deliberately burning that boat. We jumped into the sea, we rescued people. They were sent to hospital by ambulance. We are just grateful that no harm was done to those people. I return the ugly words said to us to their owners. I really want to forget all this right now and go to sleep, mates. Good night. Take care. Well done, Emre. He spoke so calmly. I want to go to sleep and forget all this. Do you? I'm human, too. We have so much in common. Let's sleep together. -What? -What? Oh, did I say "Let's sleep together"? I was thinking out loud again. You've been thinking out loud a lot lately. I should see a doctor or something. This is not good. Anyway, get to sleep. Good night. Ezgi, did lightning strike this hotel last year? My dear Nurdan who turns my winter into summer. Look at my channel. Look at the number of subscribers. The channel took off! I'm on social media now. I have a proposition for you. Is that so? What's the offer? Watch the video of those idiots? Greetings, dear followers. We're here with a brand new format. "Video Honeymoon".

We were just saying there is something missing in our project. You, I swear. -That's a great idea. -Oh, really? Yes, brother. Why? Because we talked about it with Umut. Nurdan and you are our favorite couple. I swear, Nurdan and I can add a lot to this project together. Yeah, absolutely. What are you talking about? It's going to be a scene. Crazy! A sensation! But there is a problem. You know, Serhat, we've been jerks, too. But you've been ranting and raving about us in your videos. The audience will say, what happened? Was it all a game? To avoid those, let's do this. You delete those videos. Let's act more freely. Which video? Dude, the videos you made! -What video? -Didn't you make a video? I mean, which video? I mean, it's all been deleted! -Bro! -You! You, my brother! You're a weasel! I'll do it right in front of you. -Did you speak English? -A little bit. -So delete. -Okay. -This is delete. -Great. And that one. That's a delete. What is this? Dating app, man. Don't do it. Man, you... You saw it, I deleted them all. Amazing. I swear to God, this is it. I'm so happy. I like you so much! I didn't know you were such a good person. Give me a hug. Okay, yeah. Stop staring at her. Don't worry about him. You know him. You're a good person, but that's not a good look. -How is he looking... -Don't worry about him. Aren't you the honeymoon couple? You're supposed to be energetic. Here, eat this. Taste it. -How is it? -So juicy. -Is that a red melon? -He knows geography, too! Oh, man, you! Clever dude. This is the hotel where we're going to film the Video Honeymoon. We're new partners. -Our other partner is... -Very good. -Partners? -Our other partner Ezgi. -Hello, sister. -Ezgi, Serhat. -Welcome. -Nurdan. Video Honeymoon couple. Is that so? You know, the Video Honeymoon project? -This is the new couple. -Congratulations. Good for you. -I'll show you to your rooms then. -Thank you. Ezgi, you must be busy at the reception, I'll take care of it. -Okay. -Yeah, exactly. Aren't we partners? You show Nurdan to her room. Serhat, why don't we make a video with you? Come here. -Yes, mate. -Come here. -Shall we sit down? -Sit. Okay. We deleted the videos, which is fine. Why don't you explain that to the followers? -Could you tell it in a subtle way? -Okay, mate. This is your room. Oh, wow! It's beautiful. The view is amazing. Has the Video Honeymoon project started, Emre? It hasn't started yet, honey. Let me ask you something. Sure. You and Mr. Nurse are not married yet, are you? Well, the signatures haven't been signed yet. Then I need to explain a rule to you. What's the rule? -Nurse Serhat's channel... -Don't do that. Don't do that anymore. -Let it go. -Okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. I apologize to Umut and Emre, guys. What I did was so wrong, I took advantage of them. By the way, Brother Umut is here. Say hi. I've said I'm sorry. I won't do this kind of thing anymore. Good for you. It happens. If there's anything else you want me to say... No, that's enough. It's all right. -I'm hanging up. -Do it. Well done, nurse. -You're a sympathetic person. -Thank you, brother. Should I go to my girl? She's with your mate, you know. -That scoundrel. -Of course. Don't think like that, man. You just go up to the room for yourself, enjoy the room a bit. -Okay. -Go on. Then I'm out of here. You weasel. -What did you do, get it done? -Yes. My Nurdan. My beautiful girl. Are the preparations for me? No, just the usual, everyday stuff. Okay, love, give us some lip. Come on, please. Serhat, why don't you go to the hospital? You haven't got your days off yet. We're here for a week. Love, the hospital will be there. Come on, please. Come on, love. Darling, I'm going to take a nice bath now. And then I'm going to have a nice lie-down in my bed. Fine, I'll go then. -Come on, Serhat. -Good, I'm gone. Come on. Serhat, come on. -I'm going then. -Serhat, move. -Okay. -Go dear, come on. I'm leaving. I'll do the same when I have a million subscribers. -Okay, dear. -I'll do it. Crazy boy. -Greetings. -Welcome. Hello there. We're here for the Video Honeymoon thing. I'm Selçuk, my wife... Eyşan! Nice hotel you have here. Thank you. Welcome, Mrs. Eyşan. Hello. How do we do the check-in? I'll need your IDs, please. I had yours. -You do. -I have a driving license. -Is that okay? -No problem. Good. I'm on my way. -Hello. -Hello, welcome. How do you like it here? Thanks, darling. Yeah, it's really beautiful. Then I'll sign you in. IDs please. Sure. Here you go. And yours, please. I have his. That this idiot always loses them, you know? My love, I did it once. I didn't do it again. Sure. My husband is my first love. I'm so lucky. He's a wonderful husband. A gentleman. And generous. And has good taste, too. Right, love? Yes, love. Beren is really... -Wonderful. -Huh? -Wonderful. -A wonderful person. I respect every decision Beren makes. Because I know that she always makes the best decisions. In fact, it was Beren's idea to come here. I love her so much, I'm so in love with her. She's everything to me. She's everything to me. My one and only. I said I'll fall in love, and I'll fall in love only once. And I waited until Eyşan came to me. This is important. I'll underline it. You could say I'm a pioneer of love. I don't know, I'm crazy. I mean, I'm energetic. Like. Isn't that right, love? He is. He started following me. He slid every night into my DMs. At first I was going to scold him, but then I thought I'd give him a chance. I immediately texted him, "How do you know me?" Right away, "seen" by Selçuk. He replied, "I do not know you, I do not have a beginning, will you be my end?" Isn't that sweet? No, that's your sweet self. Excellent. It's marvelous. It's beautiful. I love it. Right, love? Good. Enjoy yourselves. Let me know if you need anything. -Danke schön. -Bitte schön. By the way, I want a lot of fun videos from you. Oh! Wait. -Come. -Wait, darling, stop. Wait. Let's put it like this. Let's make a video now. Sit first, then me. Sit here. My love, sit down. -Over there? -Come a little closer, sweetheart. Now me. Okay. -Love. -What? Round the waist. Here's what I'll do. My first and last love. I love you. How do I look? Love. Love. Wait, love. My heart starts beating when I see your image. And my life starts here today with you. Not good. ...starts here with you. You need to say that last sentence again. It's not right. ...starts with you. It's okay, Eyşan, it's good. Come on! I'm not a movie star. I'm your husband. Just post it. It's good. Fine, suit yourself. I'll upload it like this. I'm going to go take a shower. Then we'll do it again. We'll do it. I'm going to go to the beach. I'll get some sea air, but I won't leave without a kiss. Give us a kiss over here. -Look, we'll do it again later. -I promise! We'll take five takes, we'll do ten takes. We'll put in five in, take 15 out. No problem. Tolga nein. But didn't we just talk about this last night? We don't eat chocolate anymore, darling. Are you in the game again? What can I do, darling? Those bastards attacked my city. They must know I'm on my honeymoon. Okay, I'm going to the beach. You can come if you want. All right, love. I'll be right with you. Honey, what can I do? I'm at war. When the war is over and I rescue the prisoners, I'll come to you. I promise you. Ach so. Okay, tschüss. See you later, darling. -Tschüss. -Tschüss, darling. I'm waiting for you. Okay. Oh, come on! What are you doing here? Why do you care? Geez! What are you doing here? I'm on my honeymoon with my husband. Please let's not bump into each other here again, okay? What? Honeymoon? Video Honeymoon? That's right, honey. Then we'll meet again and again. Cause I'm on a Video Honeymoon with my wife. Anyway, Beren, let's talk for five minutes. Let's make a deal. Huh? Come on. Let's go. Anyway. My daisy. My daisy, I've taken my leave. I'm off for a week. Let's go upstairs. Wait a minute. You know what happened while you were gone? -What happened? -The other couples have arrived. They made a video with them. Why don't they make a video with us? Huh? -Huh, yeah. -Geez. Kook, Beren, what's done is done. All gone. We took the rings off, the engagement's over. I mean, since we're both married I say you go your way, I go my way. Right? Don't beat around the bush, Selçuk. Say what you have to say. I'm telling you, I don't care about you being here. I won't end my honeymoon. Let's have fun here. Now that we've both written each other off don't recognize me and I won't recognize you. -Deal? -Deal. In fact, let's drop the ex-fiancé story. We've never met each other, never seen each other. All right, it's a deal. Are you the honeymooners? Hotel Video Honeymoon? Yes and no, sister. We came for the Video Honeymoon, but we're not married. English, we are not married. But you said engagement. You're engaged, not married? We were engaged. We took the rings off. Don't tell me we did. I ended it, me. Sister, he's an ex. Ex couple? Okay. Mike. Yes, yes. How do you know about the Video Honeymoon? Suzi and I married. -Married. -Married. Came for Video Honeymoon. This is Mike. Congratulations. Modern, good friend, open mind. Open minded. -Yes, open mind, bravo. -Yes. No, hey! Yellow Coke. Look at me. Don't talk about such things in the hotel. Look at me, hold your tongue. You've never seen us, you don't know us. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. Good. Bye. Look at me. Beren has another husband, I have another wife. Understand? So, you've never seen us. Okay? Okay bro? -Okay. -Okay. Okay? Then take care. Bye. -See you. -See you. I came to this hotel on holiday last year. I meet Suzi here. We... Love at first sight. Yes. How do you say? -Lightning? -Yes. -Lightning? -Yes. Yes. Lightning love. I said. So we got married, back in New York. So, we fell in love in this hotel. Umut, Suzi and Mike make a nice couple. Good. The lightning bolt was good. I think it's good, but I'm confused about something. Why is Ezgi lying about this? I don't understand that, either. Did we just see wrong? Or did you make a video for a couple? You saw right. Why? Well, that makes four couples. You said three couples. Mike and Suzi one, Tolga and his wife, Selçuk and his wife. Three pairs. You're not included, man. It was a joke. We were joking. Have some strawberries. Can you say that one more time? We joked. Can you say that one more time? It was a joke, mate. If you could tell me one last time, I'll understand. We made fun of you. Peace. I'll finish you, man! I'll ruin you, man! You won't be able to go in public! I'll end you, man! I'll end you! Come on, girl. What are you standing there for? Go, nurse, go! Get married first! Move it! Oh, my God. Brother Umut, I'll put the flowers here. Okay. Brother Umut, why did you become partners here? You'll get hurt. Why, mate? I told you before, lightning struck this hotel last year. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Everyone in the hotel has gone mad, some of them even went insane. Are you serious? I'm serious. People get weird when they come to this hotel. There are magnetic fluctuations here. All Akyaka is talking about it. Didn't Miss Ezgi tell you? Ezgi, this hotel was struck by lightning last year. Why did you say no when I asked you? Are you sure I said no? Yes. I asked you here the other day. And you said no, brushed it off. I must have been confused. It happens. Ezgi, are there any lunatics in this hotel? What lunatics? Who told you that? Forget the lightning, the lunatics. Come on, we got the couples here. We have to make a video tonight. We've got to be sharp as a tack. Come on! Anything else, Emre? The ambience is great. I love it. I think it's beautiful, too. And you're glowing, too. Just one little thing missing. I'll get it right away. It's so beautiful. -Love it. -If you'll allow me. Thank you very much. Never without Zen. They are coming. -Hi guys! -Hi! Now that Suzi and Mike are here, we can get acquainted. Gather round, everyone. Shall we start here? This is Mike. -I'm Beren. -Tolga. Eyşan. Selçuk here. Hey, Yellow Coke. Come, let's dance. Come on. Shake. Come on. Shake baby. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. If you really need it, Beren. Love, why did you say that? She was upset. What do I care? And why are you meddling in my business, Tolga? Madam, I think you're a little tense. Do yoga in the morning. You'll stretch. We also want to participate in yoga with you. They are special. They do yoga together. Love ex yoga forever, eh, Selçuk? Beren? What ex, man? Mike says you're exes. Ex-fiancé. You two yoga forever. Remember you special yoga in the morning. Morning yoga! What is he saying, Selçuk? She says ex! What's she saying? What are you talking about? What ex, what fiancé? What pretty? Did you two know each other? Were you engaged? No. Don't lie to me! Oh, yeah? I'm leaving! -Come here, where are you going? -You can't go anywhere! -Can you tell me what happened? -Tell me. -What happened? -Let me tell you. -What's that got to do with me? -Look, you're being rude. -Why did you lie to me? -But he said he was your fiancé. Wait a minute! Guys, can I have your attention, please? Suzi and Mike are a lovely couple. They wanted to say very nice things to you, you misunderstood. What's that got to do with it, Ezgi? Fine, you don't speak English. But you don't know Turkish, either? She said they met on the beach and they said they were engaged. That's what she said. Look, I'll ask you again. Isn't that what you said, Suzi? Eyşan! Oh, for God's sake! Are you going to ask a tourist about your husband? I'm very offended. I'm going to my room. You're not going. You can stay. I'm leaving. Look how I'm leaving! Eyşan! I'm leaving, too. I can't stay here. -What? -Well done, Selçuk! I'm leaving! No way! Eyşan! Stop! Wait a minute. Let's talk. Wait a minute! It's not like how it seems! We're on our honeymoon, what do you care? What are you, conjoined twins? And did you ask me, "Honey, can I go?" If I tell you to go, you'll go! If I say stay, you'll stay! Now stay right there! -I won't stay. -Why? Are you going after this İzmir girl cause she said she was going, Tolga? All right! I accept it! When I first came from Germany, I fell for this horse thief and we got engaged. Whoa! I get the horse, but what the hell is a thief? But as you can see, he's a jerk, so I took the ring and threw it in his face. In Germany they call people like that pig! Take this pig and walk away, all of you! Swine Selçuk! Sure, yeah, Exactly wonderful pig! Get the hell out of here! What are you talking about, girl? Schweinsteiger! And what? She threw the ring? Didn't I leave you? Yes! -I'll give leave a slap on you, you'll see! -What! -What! Of course! -What are you saying? Calm down! I am here as of the moment with Video Honeymoon facts, friends. Umut and Emre's Video Honeymoon idea is a complete fiasco. It's a flop. Only an idiot can come up with this idea. Why? Because God doesn't have a stick, he has lightning. He'll come down on you like that. I regret to inform you, dear subscribers. To make a profit off a person just for personal gain is so wrong. I strongly condemn them. And what exactly is this Video Honeymoon idea anyway? Can someone explain that to me? I mean, what is this? Let's put a couple of cameras in the room. Show people people's wedding nights live! Live wedding night! I'm ashamed to say it. You bastards! I'm addressing Umut and Emre. I warn them as a friend. They should turn back from this mistake as soon as possible. And apologize to the public. By the way, friends, we are doing very well in subscriptions. Go on. Keep going. Keep subscribing. Unsubscribe from them, subscribe to me, okay? Take care of yourselves. Goodbye. Bye. I'm hanging up. Tarık! Get cinder for the hookah, mate! No, Selçuk. It gives you palpitations this late at night, love. Speak up. What are you doing here? -Where is Beren? -Where is Selçuk? Beren! Beren! Beren! Why didn't you film me? We failed, brother. What have we failed? What the hell is going on? What was it, I saw a white flash. Was that lightning? Yeah, lightning struck. But don't worry, everyone will be fine in five minutes. Everyone, Ezgi? Slow down. We've got a lot of work to do. -Okay, I... -I'll sit. I'll cover you. Is my baby cold? I'm cold. Shall I warm you up? Okay. You're a beautiful woman, you know? I mean, really. You're so very precious to me. I swear to God. May my existence be a gift to your existence. Okay. Go to sleep, love. -Mike? -What? Our door is open? Yeah! But what do they doing in our room? Babe, not our room. But, I am so tired. My love is tired. Selçuk! Where are you? Beren. Ow! Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm Beren's husband! Beren, we're on our honeymoon! You! I'll beat you! -Come! Come here! -I'll beat you up! Come on! You! Take that! What the hell are you doing here? -My eye! -Go away! -Go! -I'll show you! -Beren help me! Who is this? -Leave my husband alone! -Don't hit him! -He's my husband! Are you all right, love? -Help me! -Selçuk! Come here, you! What's my husband doing in bed with your husband? God damn you! -Let me go! -Selçuk! God damn you! -Selçuk! God damn you... -Let me go! Damn you! -Love, help me! -What are you looking at? God damn you! I'll strangle you! -Come here, I'll kill you! -Tolga! Love, help me! Are you all right, Selçuk? Feeling better? I'm okay. He surprised me with his attack, otherwise I wouldn't have... -I know. -Whatever. Fuck you! -Don't hit me in the hospital! -Okay. We're at the hospital! -We're in the hospital! -Gentlemen, grow up. Doctor. Okay. Later... Calm down. You've subscribed to the hospital! Don't cause us any more trouble. Doctor, this is a little different. There was a lightning strike. It's not like it's a cliché. We bring in new patients, you know? When you study medicine, you lose your feelings after a while. -Must be. -Good day, doctor. You know, what am I going to do? You just wait. What are you doing? What are you filming? Who cares about you, you snot! God knows what you've done. That honeymoon's going to be a disaster. And I'm going to belly-dance like this. You'll see. Serhat, I'm going to hurt you. -Okay? Stop it. -Stop. Are you going to hurt me? Did you hear he's going to hurt me? He's going to hurt me! -Security! -Man, look. Don't play. -Security! -Don't shout. Security! He's hitting me in the head! He's hitting my head! Bullying in the hospital! Stop hitting me! It hurts! Stop it! -Security! -Dude... -Take them. -Come on, get out. -Come on, man. -Can't you see he's playing? -Come on, mate. -You have to throw him out. For God's sake. Give it a rest. I'm sick of going through the same thing every time. Let's go! Move! Suckers. Wait a minute, what's the deal? Get out of here! I swear to God... I dropped my hat. What if you had your hat? First you were just pushing me, now you're holding me. -Are you flirting with me? -Get off, mate! Why are you guys being so difficult? We're being difficult? You're being difficult. -"You're being difficult!" -Look! -What are you going to do? -For God's sake! -I'm going in there. -Come here! Come here, don't run away! Get the hell over here! -Sorry... -I will go in this hospital. You know what? I'll get you, man! I'm fed up. I'm fed up! I swear to God, I'm sick of it. I don't want to talk about Umut and Emre. I don't want them to get clout off me. But I have to talk now. They invented something called Video Honeymoon to advertise a hotel. You see the results. They've ruined the honeymoon of lovers. Just like chick TV just like reality TV they turned people against each other. Disgraceful! It's a total disgrace! At least don't put that on your channel, man. Don't put that disgrace on your channel. Look, look at this "Video Honeymoon." Two grooms are hospitalizing each other. They're beating the shit out of each other. And they're sharing this. It's a sensation. It'll be watched. Our country loves it. Shame on you! Shame on you! Whoever protests has every right to do so. Normally I wouldn't talk at all. But a loyal subscriber whom I can never say no to said "Speak, Nurse Serhat, speak. If you keep quiet, where and how will we learn the truth? Speak." Of course, I couldn't help it. After all, we are doing public service here. My Nurdan for you too, love. Silly boy. -I have to go. -Oh, God. Look, Tolga. Brother, we'll fight. We'll bout. But it's not like that, brother. I mean, we went to bed unconsciously. Nothing happened between us. Selçuk, please shut up. I swear to God, I'll crack your head open again! And don't mention Beren's name! Fuck you! Fuck you! Who's your deal, man? Look at this matchstick guy! We'll get up in the morning and leave. And you can do whatever you want! I don't deal with barbarians like you. All right. Go to bed and rest. What kind of people are you? Go to bed and sleep. But please, I have a simple request. Everybody sleep with his own wife. Please. Take it easy, go and rest. Look, you'll feel great tomorrow. All right. Go ahead, come on. Eyşan. Don't come up! Don't come up? Lightning struck, we lost our minds! Don't come up, Selçuk, Go lie on a sunbed, on the beach. Leave Akyaka. You're not coming here! How can I sleep on a sunbed? I have a herniated disc. Let's talk for five minutes. -I'm coming, just for five minutes. -I don't want you to come here! Oh! Eyşan! Eyşan! Eyşan! Eyşan, don't die! Eyşan! Eyşan! Don't die, Eyşan! -What happened? -We're losing her! We're losing her! -Eyşan! -What the fuck! -Eyşan! -Man, what is this? What's going on? Tell him she is doing Pilates. Tell me she lost her bed. Don't tell me she's dead, what's going on? Say something, man! -Let's go! -Where? -To the hospital! -Let's go! Wait a minute, I'm taking her this time. You're staying here, come on. -No way! -I've got it! Go to bed. Go on. What happened? Eyşan committed suicide! She fell from the balcony! Help! Help me, doctor! Where's the emergency? Is this it? Where is the emergency? Mr. Doctor, is this the ER? You guys again? Eyşan committed suicide! It's nothing. She jumped from the first floor. What are you doing in that hotel? What are you taking? Are we going to work for you, brother? She was struck by lightning, she lost consciousness. So, everyone was conscious before the lightning struck? Geez! What are you looking at, man? Lay her down! -Where should I lay her? -There. -Do you want her there? Okay. -Yes. -Where? -Here. I'll lay her there. Eyşan! -Easy! -Eyşan! -Open your eyes. Don't die! -Okay. -Stop it! -Eyşan, what will I do if you die? -I'll check if she's breathing. -Okay, hold on. Let me feel her pulse. Hold on. She's coming round. Where are we? We're at the hospital, sweetheart. Madam, how are you feeling? Are you in serious pain? My leg hurts so much. What happened to me? What do you mean? Don't you remember? He said you committed suicide. What suicide? Darling, you told me not to come. You were on the balcony. Then you jumped. And then I jumped, too. No, she doesn't remember. I fell after I sneezed. I didn't commit suicide. Come on. That's your influencer honeymoon. Because of these people, our wives and daughter are in danger. Who's married to who? Whose hands are in whose pockets? Who is what? What are you doing, man? What are you guys doing? They were struck by lightning and still didn't learn. And now someone has committed suicide. Who commits suicide on their honeymoon? Who commits suicide on their honeymoon? Explain that to me! Just to advertise a hotel I honestly think that there should be a limit to human exploitation. They invented this "Video Honeymoon". What do they make people watch instead of love and romance? They show fights, suicide, death! I strongly and violently condemn these posts of yours, brother! Condemn you! Cancel them! Cancel them! Don't let them wake up in the morning! Cancel him! Everybody report! Unsubscribe off! I'll do it first. Hang on, hold on a second. I did it. It's your turn, mates. Everybody report them. Keep going, mates, till they close the channels. Don't stop! Let's go! Whatever you do goes along with you. Let's go! I have to go. Bye. I'm trending number one! I'm trending, man! I'm trending! Trending! I'm an influencer! An influencer! Nurdan! I'll go to Nurdan. An influencer! I'm trending! Trending! I'm an influencer! Umut! Man, get up! Man, get up! What the hell is going on? I've passed last night. Look at this! I see the back of the phone. Turn it round. Dude, I don't remember the password. Did I post a video from the hospital? Someone's in the account! There are videos, there are complaints on the account! I don't remember it, either. Who uploaded these videos? Hospital. Video. Serhat. Nurse. The nurse! Tolga! Tolga! Listen to me! I'm not done yet! What more can you say, Beren? You've been talking all night! Eyşan says she's leaving and you're leaving! Don't think I didn't realize you liked her as soon as you saw her! You slept with her husband! And you're scolding me? I said blackout! Shut up about it! It doesn't matter if you've lost consciousness! That's how your subconscious comes out! -What does that mean? -Do you know what it means? No! I don't know! You're in love with him! You jumped on his bed the first chance you got! What did you just say? -What did you say? -Don't shout at me. If I was in love with him, I wouldn't throw the ring in his face! I'll show you. -What are you doing? Don't! -I threw it in his face like this! It's over. I divorce you! If there's a divorce, I'll do it! Beren divorces! It's over! Get on the live feed in a minute and check it out! Hear ye, hear ye, virtual folk! I'm divorcing Tolga. And I'm divorcing him as soon as tomorrow. Unfortunately, Tolga was defective. So, I'm returning him to his family. Why are you messing with my family? Get away! Your mum can look after you from now on. I thought you loved my mum and dad so much. I'm okay with your dad, I didn't like your mom. Shame on you, girl. Shame on you! Damn you! Did it hurt, darling? -Right? -Right. -Wait there. -Come on, I'm waiting. Bad woman. Geez! What is it with you and mom? You should love my mom. Here, get your stuff. Tolga! What are you doing? Stupid jewellery! No, don't you dare! Don't you dare, I bought it in Germany! -That was made in Germany! -And these are your snacks. Made in Germany! I'm humiliated. Don't worry, I'll send the rest later, okay? Tolga! Tolga! What can I do with a woman coming to her honeymoon with antidepressants? Good, I'm off the hook. Pills go in the loo. Beren goes his way, and that's the end of it. That's all that's left of you. Your candy. These taste awful. -There's security. Is it them? -I think it's them. -Hello, good day. -Yes. -Can I come in? -No. Brother, let's not go through this again. Our friend committed suicide. -Please. -We're just going to visit him. Don't you understand, mate? You're banned. Come on. -Let's not be difficult! -Do we have to be difficult? -You'll give me a hard time? -I'll give you a hard time. Let go of me. They're doing their job. Come. Mate, please go back, come on. Let's go! Yes, Umut? Selçuk, is Eyşan okay? Did you see her? She's fine. Thank God, she's fine. We have a situation. There are Spartans at the gate. We couldn't get in. This idiot nurse made a video. He said Eyşan committed suicide. And to top that, he blew up Emre's account. He stole his password or something. If you find him, give him a beating. But now we can't go in, leave some beating for us. Bring him outside, we'll beat him together. Okay, he'll beat him. Why do you set an account of five million's password 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3? I'm going to the loo. You're driving me crazy, goddamn it! Brother Umut! -Can we take a photo? -Of course, come here. -Can I have the phone, mum? -Here, dear. -Give it to Emre. -Can you shoot us? -What's your name, sweetheart? -Melis. -What was your password, Melis? -1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. I'm sorry. It's not about you. Smile, Brother Umut. Okay. Here. Melis, can you tell Brother Emre the password again? -1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. -Say it again. 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. Say it again for God's sake. 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. Here! -Let go! -Come here. What the hell do you want from us? Why are you filming us without telling us? What do you want from us? Why are you filming us? I'm a influencer, I'm free. I can talk about anything I want. I'll burn you! Are you threatening us? I won't let you defame my hotel. I won't let you stay in this town. Come on, hit me. Give me a flick. I'll finish you. I'll ruin you. I'll ruin you. He did! But I expected this. This is an aggressive mate. But we're fellow countrymen. I would never expect such things from you... I'm sorry! I'm offended and insulted. I need to document this moment. Where's my phone? -Come here. Where are you going? -Let go! -Security! -And he's going to burn us? -Security, ah! -You son of a bitch! -I'll kill you. -Stop, please. -Easy! -What are you doing! Stop pushing! -Come on, don't make a scene. -Calm down! -Calm down. -Get out of here! -Come on! -What, are you herding cattle? -What is this? -I swear to God! At first you feel a bit humiliated, but then you get used to it. -Third time's the charm. -Come on, brother! -What's up? -Don't make a scene! Shut up! Our taxes are paying your salary. What's up? We pay for your food, brother. You can't treat the citizens like this. Get higher! Beat him up. -Stop it. -Fight them? -We'll call the gendarmerie. -The gendarmerie is here. -Here they are. -He read your mind, I swear. Sir! The Turkish Gendarmerie. -These are the ones causing trouble? -Yes, sir. What? I'm from here. I have a hotel here. These are my partners. Look, mates. Go back to your hotel. I've got a complaint about you. Just so you know. Go to your hotel, don't cause any trouble. Okay? Sir... Dude, look, I'm holding it in. It's not about you. You know? I'm going crazy. It's not about you. Hi, guys! How's Eyşan? Why do you care? What the hell is it to you? None of your business. Look at me! I threw the ring. I divorced Tolga. All because of you! But your marriage will end, Selçuk. May your marriage burn to ashes, Selçuk! May you never see the light of day! My wife fell off the balcony! Wait a minute, man! My wife fell off the balcony. She's still talking shit! What are you talking about? Eyşan, Eyşan, Eyşan! No one is thinking about Beren. Nobody's thinking about Beren. She was stupid, she fell off the balcony. Where did you find you idiot wife? "Idiot" is your father! Not at all, she's the idiot! I hope she dies! I don't give a shit. Look at her tongue, man. Look at the thorns! -You know what? -Don't. I'll hit you with my size nine on your mouth! Here's another one. I'm sick of you! -Wait! -Take that foot off. Die! Look at him! -Ezgi, take him away. -Okay. I'll kill you! Help! Very help. We got a femicide here! Say they are cutting her. They're cutting her, yes! All right. I'll go. But I was wondering if I could be a comfort to Tolga beforehand. Don't let him feel sorry for her. I talk to him and then I'll go? Selçuk, we've seen your consolation. Don't push us. Go to your room. Do I look nervous? I'm calm! Look, I'm very calm right now. I shouldn't talk to him, I don't understand? Dude, you're usually a bit tense, that's why we're a bit... Shut up, what are you talking about? Do I look angry? No, am I nervous? I don't understand. No, not at all! Get out of my way. Open the door! All right, I'm convinced. Open it, go ahead. Open it. Tolga, let's talk a little... Oh! What happened to him? Dude, did he commit suicide? This is Beren's pill. When you take too many you faint, you die. -He's done. -What happened to him? -We'll go to the hospital. -Lift him. Give me that. -Did he die? -Get him, brother. He's like a corpse. -Here, take this away. -He's not dead, is he? Bring him here. That boy wasn't that pale. That bitch, she's knocked the color out of this one. Okay, Selçuk, go to your room. I'm going to go in the room. Umut. Let's get him to a hospital, the nurse will be there. I'm going to give him such a tune-up, man. He's like a corpse. Look at my hair! My hair's all messed up. Selçuk! Who is that? Who are you taking? Mike. He snooped around the room and passed out. -Oh. -He drank too much! Oh, my God. I told you this is Turkey. It's not like other places. Don't drink too much! Why are you lying to her? Screw this honeymoon, man! This place is cursed. And we're partners now? Don't complain, open the door. Open it. Head first, wait! Act natural. Sir, welcome! We've got a murder call. Femicide. That's right, it's an open buffet. Tragedy, intrigue, murder! -What are you saying, boy? -But not in our hotel. We don't have that in our hotel. We have male suicide. We'll take him to the hospital. Why are you stalling us? Let's take him and then we can talk about it. We've forgotten about him. -Get! -Okay! EMERGENCY ENTRY Doctor, he swallowed these antidepressants like M&amp;Ms. But they are not his. -Someone else's. -How many people are in your hotel? There's that strange boy, there's that auntie. There are six customers. Three is us. -11. -11, Doctor. What the hell are you doing running a hotel? You couldn't even look after a kitten! It's like we asked him to operate, why is he scolding me? -Serhat, come here! -Stop. -Hold it. -Come here, conspirator! -Come here. -Get him! Take it! -Get the phone! -Come on. -We're in the ER! -My phone is ringing. -There's a pandemic, God damn you! -Thief! Give me the phone! Hold this. These guys? Come on. Get in the back. Oh. What are you doing here? Don't ask, man. I can't tell you on the way, come on. All right, lads? All right, sir. We're all here. If we pick you up again, you'll never leave this station! -Do you understand? -Right. Understood, commander. Well, I've got a question, who turned us in? Femicide or something? A tourist from your hotel. A tourist? He says it's our hotel. Tourist, he says. -Dude, calm down. -Look. He went and complained about us, for Christ's sake. Did you hear that? Where's my wife? Where's my wife, brother? She's in hospital! Where am I? I'm at the police station! -Don't shout. -I'm at the police station! I'll go to that hotel. This is all their doing! -I'll drown them! -Calm down. -I'll strangle them! -Why the gendarmerie... Selçuk you're shouting that you'll strangle them next to the gendarmerie. -I'll strangle them! -Don't shout! -You calm down! -You calm down! How can I be calm? -Psycho. -I didn't call Eyşan either. -Hello? -What happened? -Call. -Eyşan Yılmaz. I'm her husband. How is she, is she okay? Did the doctor give the all clear? Oh, thank God. Can you tell her, please? I'll come and get him. Give it to me! -Hello! Tolga Bükülmez's wife. -I'm going to kill them! I'm his wife, suicide. My husband. Calm down. We'll talk on the way. Selçuk, calm down! Hurry up. Darling, I'll tell you. Please, I'll put you up in a different hotel. -We love this hotel. -Would you hurry up? What's femicide? There! Informers! -The blonde bitch is mine! -What's femicide, man! -Why you... -Hi Beren. Hi! What kind of holiday is this? Hello, sir, how did you recognize my voice? Oh, you saved my number after all that? Would you come to the hotel? I'm sick of this place. What am I telling you? What are you doing? You've quadrupled the back again. Ezgi, I'm sorry, but there really is a curse on this hotel. Guys, don't say that. There are six customers. If we take care of two customers apiece? Two in the hospital, four at the police station. Isn't this a disaster, mates? Yeah. And the real disaster is here, on the phone. Constant harassing messages, offensive language, complaints. Hundreds of thousands of reports. We're dealing with these. We can't do our job. I think the hotel business was a mistake. Let's get back to our business. Yes, brother! Umut, the channel's gone. Look! That's all I needed! It was bound to happen. Anyway, most of them follow you, too. I'll turn on live and you can explain it there. What the hell? "Due to your violation of the community rules agreement your account has been closed." What did we do? Did we cross our legs in front of the older followers? Did we want an invasion? Why are they treating us like Joker? I'm fed up. Did we want anarchy? The money's gone, the channels are gone. No one will come to this hotel after all that. This lightning thing is making me stupid. I can't think. I lost it. There's that, too. The lightning. We're asking Ezgi, she's half-answering. Like she has fifty per cent charge. But there's something. We've lost so much, we've been through so much. Let's at least answer two questions. One. Why is Ezgi hiding something from us? Two. How the hell did that little nurse kill our accounts? God damn it, Umut! What? I've got it. God damn it. It's nice, isn't it? Emre, I was thinking, should we do another one? This one doesn't feel right. Let's kiss again. But this one will be on me, huh? Yeah! But wait. Your hair's all messed up. Why don't you go fix your hair? -Don't look out bad in the video, right? -Okay. -Wait for me. -Okay, hurry. Idiot! How could you do this? I'm going crazy, Emre! How could you give up the shop for a kiss? You couldn't even kiss her. Didn't you come here to get Ezgi? You're going to drive me crazy. Ezgi, Ezgi, Ezgi. Emre. She's cute. Cute. Sweet girl. Don't do my impression. Stop telling me about Ezgi. -And don't you say Nurdan to me! -I will! Nurdan! -Ezgi! -Nurdan! -Ezgi! -Nurdan! Nurdan! Ezgi! Ezgi. What are you hiding from us, dear? Don't look at me like that, Ezgi. We can't put the puzzle together. The pieces don't fit together. There's something in this hotel. What's this lightning thing? Tell us about it. I have to keep quiet to protect my hotel, Umut. This place is my father's legacy. I'll do anything to protect this place. Wouldn't you? Ezgi? My daughter! Ezgi, won't you say hello to your dad? Welcome, dad. I was a little surprised to see you. I've been reading about the hotel on the internet. I escaped from the nuthouse. Did lightning strike our hotel again? Yes, dad. That's what happened. But I'm fine, don't worry. Who are these guys? I'm getting bad vibes from this way. Negative vibes! It's coming from the bearded one hiding there. Son, why are you hiding? Who are you? No, we are not hiding. You had a very inbred style, I just found it a bit strange. I wasn't like this originally, I had an accidental mutation. I'm a self-made man, you know? Do you mind? Who are they, girl? They're my partners, dad. Is that so? Do you reside in an asylum, sir? What do you think, dickhead? I don't have a criminal license. I could cut you to pieces right here, and I'd be fine. But there's a shortcut to everything. -Dude, he's got a weapon. -Run! -He's crazy! -You only go crazy once! Our ears have been skewered, too. I wouldn't be surprised what happens next. I wouldn't be surprised, either. I don't know who cursed us. What the hell happened to us? We said we'd scram, if we don't like it. Now we'll really have to! Is he honking us? Hello, Friends! Who are you, the Cali Cartel? It's me, Serhat. Don't you recognize me? You've come here as idiots, you'll leave idiots! Are you looking for trouble? What are you doing here? Wait a minute, man! Geez! I have a proposition for you. What is it? Come closer! You are new in this business, you amateurs. You didn't listen to your brother at the time, did you? Ass Umut! Your channels are dead. If you want, you can say what you want to say through my channel. But for a fee, of course. Ten grand plus VAT plus tax, but that's your offer Umut. For him, 15. Because he's a rapist. He's flirting with my girl, you know. We don't need your charity. Okay. I already knew that you would do that. You know what I did? I've reported you to cybercrime. -What the hell is a cybercrime? -What the hell is cyber? Nobody's a influencer these days! Get the hell over here! Did you hack my password? Let go of me! Get the hell in there. Get in! Got it! Umut! Let me out! Dude, I just bought the car. Let me drive for a while, then you can put me back here. Take me out, man! Maybe the wedge was the key. We should've never given it to him. Maybe. I'm posting a video! Watch it, nurse. What video? It's Nurdan! They came to their honeymoon unmarried. First honeymoon, then the wedding. That's exactly what we said. Guys, get ready for a sensation. Now I'll kiss the bride. Fuck your curly hair... What is Wedge Serhat doing in the boot now? He must be on fire. Dude, won't he blow up the tank? What's the matter with you? Snap out of it. Pull yourself together, brother. She lied to us, man. She scammed us. Dude, just one lie. Can a lie wipe everything away? It can't. Dude! What the hell happened to us here? We hoped. That's what I do. I wanted something nice. So did you, but the money ran out. Channels, subscribers, people abandoned us. I don't have any enthusiasm left. What can I do? Start over again? We'll start over, brother. Okay, we started a business, we failed. Will we always be successful? We have a car. We can sell our car and start over. We'll be on the road again, man. Was that for me or for you? I don't know. Not for me. For me. From Ezgi! Hello Umut. First of all, I'm really sorry about everything. I mean, if apologies mean anything to you anymore. I had to send you this video. Because I didn't have the courage to stand up and talk to you. First of all, I want you to know that you're a really great person. You still have your inner child. And you've managed to become a responsible adult. You have a conscience, you're very good, I've seen that. When you hug the child with a hurt arm. I've seen it when you were trying to help the honeymooners. Godspeed, Umut. I have no doubt that you will be successful in everything you do. I'll talk about what happened. Yeah, that was my dad. And I lied to you about him. But I had to. I had no choice. My father has been the most embarrassing person in my life. His stance, his speech, his presence, even his smell. I've been bugging you, Umut. I'm sorry. But my father didn't get like this from lightning. My dad was always like that. As for the hotel, it's not my father's legacy. I did it from A to Z. It's my labor of love. They say to forgive is greatness. If you forgive me, you'll make the saddest person in the world the happiest person in the world. Partner... That it if we're still partners. And, Umut, I want you to know I heard the way you called me cutie the first day you arrived. And I said what a cute boy. And if you're still watching this video, if you haven't turned it off when you turn your head to the side I'll be there.
