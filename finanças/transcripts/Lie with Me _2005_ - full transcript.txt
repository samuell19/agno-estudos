Men can do whatever they want. They think the city is theirs. They spray their scent in every corner. They're not afraid. I love my scent in the ground too. I've seen how pleasure touches the cock. It makes the guy look like he's never coming back. But it hurls right through him. I know how to fuck... how to get what I want. But my pleasure never feels through. Even when I come there are parts still stuck inside. Like, my pleasure clings to my stomach. swells at my throat. I need to feel myself like I've never felt myself before. David... are you in there? Come on baby. . open up. Wanna blow job? Okay... hah. Uh! Ah ha. Are you excited? Yeh! *Don't come... Okay. Don't come. Don't come. Fuck!... okay. Don't come. Don't come. Don't come. There's nothing like this feeling of knowing... Liking... knowing it's coming. it's gonna come... it's gona come. Look at me. Why was this in the garbage? Oh... sorry... we need that don't we. Here give me that. Uh, your dad's in the backyard. Why is there so much stuff out in the garbage? Give me that. What? Your dad and I... What... were you guys in a fight or something? Your father and I haven't been together for a long time. I'm moving. Talk to your mom? Yeah. I'm not hooked on danger, I'm hooked on sex. No one felt me up when I was a little girl. It's just that there are these times when I don't see what's safe... before losing my place. Down on my knees the very first time... I remember, there was all this hair at my mouth... I didn't think that was what it would feel like. And the guy kept forcing himself in my face saying... please, please, please. He sounded like a girl. I don't know if I was supposed to close my eyes... or keep them open, but... It all just happened so quick... there was this... flash. I looked up and I saw his head reeling, and I knew the guy was happy because he kept saying my name... Leila... Leila..... Leila. And he cupped his hand on the back of my head... and you know what I did? I got off my knees and I ran. That was what I thought to do... I just... I kept running... and running... racing... So fast that what'd I just done... made my heart burn. My heart felt like I had just twisted a muscle. I'm supposed to look beautiful, you know, like... ... dignified and confident with him. I'm becoming a wife for fucks sake! The thing is that I don't wear white, I never wear white... why can't I wear white? Barry came by today. How Barry? We fucked! You fucked your "X" and the wedding's in a month? He always had this thing where he wanted to cum on my face, and I always said no. This time I said, sure, ... whatever. Just don't get it in my hair. So the sex with barry is that much better. You would give up that great sex for love? Sex with Joel is great. it's emotional and... it's just if I could marry Joels' heart with barrys' cock! My cousin told me she came so hard she blacked out. Why would she give up that great sex for love? What're you doing? Nothing. What are you doing? I was looking for you. Yeah? You coming? I'm not an ax murder, come on. Excuse me a minute. Okay. Is that woman from the party your girlfriend? No. I don't believe you. Was she your girlfriend? Yeah. But she's not no more? No... Don't stop. I want you to do it. Come down here. I guess I'll see you. You wanna go on a... a date? I mean... Hang out... something... sometime? Never had a date. My work number. Leila. David. I always though that mens hearts were in their cock... I mean that... their cocks were the way that they loved. I finally had the feeling that a real person was inside me. Leila can you help out front please? Hello? Do you rent hours? Ah, yeh, we close at six. No, next day only. He got intimacy issues. He needs a mommy. Are you gonna be his mommy? Did you fuck him? You know, you can suck a guys dick all you want... And it doesn't mean he's ever gonna love you. Okay. Hello? Oh, um, yeah, no I'll be there after work... Okay. David, hi, it's, it's Leila... I... I didn't know how to get what I usually got from a man... I mean I wanted to be having sex with this guy... even more. All the time... I didn't know how to make it happen. I thought about him in my bed... On the street... It didn't matter. ... that really smarts. It's so cold, you know... It's freezing in here man... can I... put on some hot water? Do you have to drink that now? Fuck yes I gotta drink it now... Alright... you're done. Lets move the bar to the house. Lets get you up. Okay. Want some help? No... I'm going to do it by myself.

May I borrow your arm? To see you is a pleasure, thank you. Okay, there was a girl in 203, this was a long time, you weren't here... And she was a screamer, and the superintendant, had to kick her out. She doesn't need to know... Oh dear, Please tell her I'm sorry. I wish I could ride my bike forever. I wish the sun would never go down. The summer will go on... and on. Until every person is out on the street... And feeling like me. I have a question for you. Have you ever had... one man's dick in your ass... And his friends cock in your mouth? Yeah. You slut. What... because um... ... because I was dancing with those guys? Come on David I'm sorry...

Promise me. yes. Promise me you're never gonna leave me. Never... Promise me... never. Look at me. I must ask how do you know what I know... when...

I think the suit case is under his bed. Thanks. David? What are you doing? My dad used to laugh so hard when I crawled underneath his bed. And I would sort of... push him through the mattress. Will you come under here with me? Lets just go to sleep. Stop it. David stop it! David! I can't. David, stop it. David... stop it! Stop it! How does a woman love a man? He asked me never to leave him. It was a promise I couldn't keep. I didn't know how to love him. All I knew how to do was fuck. It's not enough to fuck. It's not enough. I just want your opionion... Before I sign on the dotted line. What do you think? The Landlord seems... Nice. Oh... He and his boyfriend live in the... suites downstairs. It could be a really good location for me. Of course it's... not so isolated. Where are you? I'm coming over. I woke up this morning... you weren't there. Ah it was so gross in there tonight. Some asshole was trying to pick me up and... I was just thinking how I could have kicked his balls. He just kept grabbing my anus... ... but I just wasn't interested, you know? It was disgusting. He ran his hand down my legs. He just kept on looking at me. I had to practically run outside. He continued following me I swear. It's hard for you to understand... ... to be with somebody and then fucking leave. I'm not going back there. I never did like that place. I just take the music, you know? It's so good I just love the dancing. I just think dance. You like to dance? Uhmm. I want you to dance for me.

No, I've never felt anything like that. I won't become good. I won't become nice. I'll be bad just for him. I'll fuck... just for him. When I can fuck with just looking for his love... I'll stop running. Hey miss... Miss... You wanna come to a party? Whats up, bigger up. I was... obsessed... with a girl like you. Yeah. So I followed her... ... into the bathroom at the club... ... and I went into the stall right next to her, right... ... I wanted... I wanted to break right through the wall. I could almost taste her sweet juicies. Yeah. You have to get... the scent... of your lover all over you and then... You follow? You gotta be near the sexiest scent... all over you. Yeah. Crazy. I'm going crazy. I bet you got a lover crazy. Drive me crazy... come. Come on. David, it's me. I uh... David, hi... Hi... Come here. Hi. I'm sorry I left your dads'... I can't understand you...

Leila... I don't want to ever hurt you again. I don't... ... want to be with you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to keep seeing you. I wanted to get fucked while he watched me. Him and five men breathing around me, touching me... laughing... ...pinching my tits. I wanted them all to do it to me while he watched. Men laughing at me and saying, "look how he wants it". I feel a cock between my thighs and he'd say "you've got a good girl." A cock dropping into my mouth... A cock dropping into my cunt. I knew that he'd seen everything about me right then. Over and over, each time I'd feel better. And over and over, each time it would feel worse. but I'd know that this... being seen. Being known. Well, it will be a fine life to live alone. Don't you think Morrow? Oh, maybe you've already got someone else. Some bastard waiting in the wings. Come on there's no bastard waiting in the wings. That's when you're stoned. Your mother wanted me to know. Yes, I fucking want to be alone. Is that so hard to understand, after all these years... I want to be alone. I just don't want to be married right now. What do you mean right now? When, when do you want to be married? I want to have some fun. How about you? Okay. Take your pants off. what? Take your pants off. Take those off too. I want to see your cock. Take them off. Don't touch yourself. Don't fucking touch yourself until I say you can. Don't fucking touch yourself! Don't come until I say you can. Yeah.

Will you come with me to my final dress fitting? Sure. Your folks... My dad is fucked. But I'm sure he'll be fine. Barry keeps calling me. And I told him it was okay if he came by... while Joel was still away. that's probably not the best idea. The summer was over I could feel it. It always gets hotter before it gets cooler. You don't want it to end, but... The heat slips away. The trucks here in five, I'm going to put those plants outside. Your dad is not ready for the plants. You're not packing? Should I? Dad. You can't stay here. Why not? It's my house. You grew up here for Christ's sake. Let her go if she wants. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It'll be fine. I promise you. I'm going to go visit you all the time. And you can come to my place for dinners You're going to be okay. It's not so bad to be alone. I don't know where you live. I don't know anything about you. Leila look at me. It's time it's a drunk! Are you coming? Leila. Leila! Hey. Leila I'm... I'm not gonna leave. Please open the door. You have to wait until you are uncovered. You have to wait with someone naked. And then you have to wait some more.
