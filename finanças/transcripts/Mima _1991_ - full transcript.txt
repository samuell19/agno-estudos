You used to take me with you everywhere. You used to take me hunting, or to the shoe workshop. Now it's over. You... You're becoming a woman. I can't treat you like a little girl anymore. Now your mother has to take care of you. So you love me less? Of course not, I love you just as much as before, even more.

Leave me alone. Where were you? I've been waiting for an hour. If you don't hurry up, I'll come and get you. I need the iron, go get it from the nonna. Couldn't you tell me from there? I don't want everyone to know our business. If it's not at her place, try aunt Antonia. Yeah, right. Make me do the whole neighborhood. - I want to come with you. - I don't need a baby always with me. She's bad, there's nothing to do, she's bad. 22, 23, 24, 25... - ...36 - 36, 37 Are you counting your steps too? I dream that when I get there, they'll give me $200 for each step. If I can get to an odd number without cheating, I have a wish that comes true. - And what's your wish? - If I say it, it won't come true. - Where are you going? - At my grandfather's house. Bye! Goodbye. 92, 93, 94, 95... ...107, 108, 109, 110... 111! It's me. I came to get the iron. Oh, the iron, yes, I think that the nonna put it under the sink. Aren't you cold without your coat? No, I have a vest. Does Annunziata have to come tonight? Hey don't eat it all. You're handsome. I took a bath. I do it almost every week. - I'll see you later. - See you tonight. How did you meet the nonna? It is simple. I was walking down the street and the nonna was up there at a window. She was hanging out clothes to dry. And a pair of underwear fell right in front of me. I picked it up and then I looked. And at that moment I was thinking, com'è Bella. Like a flower. And I told myself, that's her. Well, then why did you marry him? And what was that song? - So have you made up your mind? - Yes, I'll take this one, but in white. In white? It's ugly. - I thought you wanted it in red? - I changed my mind. Again? You're always changing your mind. Let's go? What's the deal? You had another fight with your mother? You look grumpy. I don't look grumpy. I had a lesson to learn, and there's too much noise inside. - Can I go to nonno's place? - No, didn't you go there last night? - I'm sure you forgot my shoes. - No, I didn't forget your shoes. I had so much work today, I had 11 pairs to do. - Will you have time tomorrow? - Tomorrow yes, did you clean your room? Yes, but I only did my half. How long did I tell you? Every day it's the same story. And you always tell me yes but I don't see anything, right? Annunziata, I told you not too close to the television. - He had another fight with Antonia. - Again? - She's on her periods. - No, she's right. Even though he's my brother, every time he's wrong, I tell him. Go set the table. Move, we're about to eat. - You, one day... - I'll have square eyes, I know. - And she even asks! - Oh, come on. Are you staying with us? He got in a fight with Antonia. - Her periods. - She has her periods! Get the water. Salvatore, please, turn off that television. What do you mean, no? We only have one moment in the day to talk. - About what? - Don't talk back and eat. And listen! You're not going to be grumpy, are you? - Tomorrow you go to school in my truck. - Pass me the sauce, please. And the cheese. Here, this will give you some colors. I'm not thirsty. And what about this wedding? Do it in the spring. Why the spring? In the spring, it will be cheaper for everyone. In the spring, you can make light dresses. - Who are you going to marry? - You, am I right? I won't get married. You will do what you're told. And eat. I have to write a letter to the social security, and I need help. To tell them what? They still haven't paid for Antonia’s teeth. For the teeth you know, they give you almost nothing. Almost nothing is not nothing. So what? Do I wait for you for dinner? Look! Don't wait for me. I thought he warned you. When I left, and the way I left, she should have understood. Thanks to you, now it's awkward with my sister-in-law. - It's not... - Not my fault, ok. Can we at least know what was the argument about? He wants her to make French friends. I only said she shouldn't live like a savage. Shit, we can be social. She doesn't talk to anyone, not even a little. With all the children, how can she find the time? She frequents only Italian women. Because French women are all puttane. And you with your big ears. Look at your plate and eat. Mima, do you want to? No! Come on! Please... All right, but quick. Here, take one. Here, keep it. You want to know what I ordered for Christmas? I know... - What? - A white bike. No. A red bike, because I changed my mind. What about you, what do you want? Nothing. Mom is making me a dress. Auntie is knitting a sweater for me. And nonno will give me $20. You're happy. Yes, and with the $20 I'm going to buy a diary with a key. What's a puttane? If I tell you, you have to pretend not to know. I swear. First of all, we say a puttana. A puttana is a woman who... Who accepts that all men court her for money. So Mrs. Jacqueline gets money from people? Well, as it turns out, yes. Girls, you've talked enough. You have to sleep. Tomorrow you'll clean your half of the room. All right. Shut up and go to sleep now. Can I give you a kiss? Faster, young lady. You don't say hello anymore? We're going to drive fast, aren't we? That dirty old guy, it was your grandfather, wasn't it? Stop and get in line. I'm tired of going to Sunday school. I already can't keep up with my homework, I don't need to add that. Can't you to tell Mom? All right. But yesterday, why didn't you come say hello to me? I brought a snack just in case. Yesterday? When exactly? I didn't see you. Hurry up, we are going to miss the news. You know Belmondo does his own stunts? You slept all the time! Why did he want to kiss your hand? It's a Calabrese that just arrived from Italy. Over there they kiss the hand of the ancients. When they meet them. It's a sign of respect. But you didn't want to. I'm not that old, am I? I'm sure you were as strong as Belmondo when you were young. Belmondo... What's the matter? You're making a strange face. If you fall with your lollipop in the mouth you can hurt yourself. There's so much I want to show you and teach you. But I won't have time. Of course we have time! Just tell Dad that... That the movie started late. Yes, you're right. Come on, I'll show you something. I know what it is. - Yes I know. - Non lo sai. I'm cold. A long time ago, I arrived with the nonna. On a boat like this one. I know. You've already told me at least 100 times. We had lost Alfredo. He had gotten stuck in the toilet. There were a lot of people waiting for you on the dock, I know. Look at this. I'll make you a keychain. Don't forget you promised to bring me there when I'm fifteen. To show me everything. The olive trees everywhere. To eat fresh ricotta cheese. And everyone will see how beautiful my Mima is. I istruita. What are you doing here? I wanted to ask you something. There's a football game on TV tonight. And a film on the other channel. Dad is probably going to watch the game. Can I watch the film at your place? Don't touch! What's the film? Beauty and the Beast. I already missed it once. All right. Tell your mother you have my permission. That way you can keep the nonna company. Why? You're not here? Where are you? Why are you worried? You should be used to it, shouldn't you? Not too much garlic, it makes me sick. Who is this blanket for? Maybe for you? For your wedding gift. You know when I grow up I'll be a stewardess. Don't listen to her. Every day she invents something. Like mother, like daughter. Me? If I only said half of that, I would have been smacked. If it's not to go get job, don't bother coming back home. French women don't know how to treat men. They always want to be right. You have to make them believe they're right. And then pulling the strings. Why you're always mean with French women? I know why. And you calm down, or you'll have to deal with me. Yeah sure, you're always threatening me anyway. She's driving me crazy, she's driving me crazy! You don't understand anything, and you never will. You're hurting me. I'm sorry but today we can't be late. I have something to tell this one. Hey little girl! When you'll see your grandfather, tell him I'm waiting for my coal. I've been freezing for two days. And why was his depot closed yesterday? I don't know, ma'am. Tell him I absolutely want it today. Yes, ma'am. Why didn't you tell her he wasn't here? How does that concern her? Annunziata look, you didn't open today's window. I only open it before I go to bed. Can I open it? If you want to. Guess what's in there? - Tell me! - No, you have to guess. Come on, tell her, Mima, don't bother her. There's a little green bike. That's not true! It's true. Mr. Ponti Luigi? Yes. Are you related to Mr. Macri Vincento? He's my father-in-law. Mr. Ponti, can you come with us, please? Did something happen to him? Please follow us. He's dead, isn't he? He's dead. Come on. Auntie, why is everyone crying? - Because... - Because nonno is dead! He's dead, isn't he? The police only thinks there's been an accident. And he died? Leave her alone. I'll tell her. Tell her what? You have nothing to tell her. Go to bed and that's it. And nonno is not dead, do you understand? He had an accident, that's all. Mom said they killed him. Your mother knows nothing. Nobody knows anything. Your father went to the police to find out. But until he gets back, no one knows. Nobody knows. So it's true? Nobody knows? Of course, it's true. Let's go to bed now. You too. Good night. Is it true that on the calendar there was a green bicycle? Yes, it's true. It's good that the nonno is not dead. That means he can give you the $20. And you'll buy your diary with the key. Yeah, it's good. He's dead, isn't he? Yes. What are you doing here? We just came to tell you goodbye. Go to school now. I said go to school! Those who killed him must die like dogs. My husband and my brothers will do it. They're going to find them. We're going to kill them like dogs. We'll kill them, my husband and my brothers will do it. We have to kill them. We have to kill them. Like dogs. They'll do it. - Who are they going to kill? - No one! Hurry up, we're gonna be late. - I don't want more people to die. - No one is going to die. Mom is crazy, completely crazy. I'm going back home to keep an eye on them. And I'm going to be alone? Of course not. You'll never be alone. Every time you'll think you're alone. You'll think of the painting. With the doe and the fawn. All right? I'm not hungry. The Rosetti, with Francesca and Luisa will arrive tomorrow. Who told them? He sent a telegram this morning. Some say we should bury him back home. His place is here. It's here. Will there be no Christmas because nonno is dead? For you there will be. And for Mima? There will be too. But nonno was going to give her $20. I'll be the one giving her the $20. Can't you thank your uncle? Do you want some fruit? Make us some coffee instead. Can I watch TV for a little bit? We're going to bed. Why? Tomorrow it's Thursday, there's no school. Go play in your room. I don't want to play. Go to my house. Anna is with the kids and they must be watching TV. Go if you want. Can I go see the nonna? She's tired, you have to let her rest. I'd rather stay here. Go to the room, we have to talk. I don't want to stay here. Then you take Pasqualina and Maria and you go home. We'll find them, you'll see. Your father-in-law didn't know how to drive. He couldn't have gone there alone. So some men came to pick him up, someone must have seen them. I mean, if everyone keeps quiet, we'll ask in the neighborhood. And it's a slow process. Why are you not in school? Because my teacher is sick. That's your daughter? Go make some coffee. Well, I'll come back as soon as I get the autopsy reports. The night I was watching the football game. You told your mother that nonno let you watch television at his house. Yes. When did you ask him? After school, I went to the depot. What was the time? 5 pm. Who was that gentleman? - A police inspector. - Why did he come here? Listen to me, Mima. Was he dressed to go out? No. He was supposed to see people. They came to pick him up. Did you see them? No. I'll wash your head. Mom, you're hurting me. Mom, you're hurting me. It's true what you told your dad? Is that true? You didn't see the men who came to get the nonno? I didn't see them. You're lying, Mima, you're lying. You saw them. No! Why are you hiding the newspaper? What's in it? Show it to me. - No. - Show her, she'll see it eventually. He was discovered near the railroad track. The coalman Vincenzo Macri was executed. What are you doing here? Where did you find this newspaper? Anne-Simon was reading it with her friends. Come with me. Now I want to know. Well... It was 30 years ago in Calabria. Your grandfather was leading a group of men who collected money for the poor. He was finding work for the unemployed. He was hiding people who were wrongfully wanted by the police. Back home people trusted him. And then one day, for political reasons he had to leave, he came here without a penny. He worked hard. And the Calabrese who came to France kept coming to him like he was... Like he was still some patriarch, from who you can ask advice. That's what the mafia didn't like. He had a power on people, that the mafia wanted. That's why they killed him. Since you know it was the mafia who killed him. Why don't you tell the police? Well. Mafia is a word, behind which people are hiding, people we don't know. No one knows who they are. And those who know anything never speaks. They are afraid. You see? You have nothing to be ashamed of. Nonno wasn't a mafia leader, as they say in the paper. He was a good man. A man that everyone loved. Nadine is as dumb as a brick. She doesn't want to believe about the doe. She says it's not possible to walk around in a painting. She's stupid, isn't she? Don't worry about her, she's jealous. You shouldn't have told her a secret. That's because in class I had my eyes closed. The teacher told me it wasn't time to nap. And everyone laughed. Nadine told me that her father said nonno was a bandit. And that we were too. That we weren't French. He also told her that we have to go back to our country. That's none of her business! Couldn't you have pulled her hair?! What's with you? Mom hasn't even bought the Christmas tree yet. If you want, I'll give you all my toys. I don't need them anymore, I'm all grown up now. What about your pearls? You're giving them to me too? Mima! Tomorrow at school, I'll draw you something nice for Christmas. Can't you let me watch? You are Mima, right? Luigi Ponti's daughter? Look over there. You see these two men standing there? Next to the grey car. With their hands in their pockets. These two men, are the ones who came to get your grandfather, the night he disappeared. Do you recognize them? Later, they'll go to your grandmother's house, to offer their condolences. But... Before they go upstairs, they'll go shake your father's hand. These two men, Mima, will walk past you, very close to you. When they'll walk past you, you'll pretend to never have seen them before. Do you promise me to do what I ask you to do? Very good Mima. I see that we can trust you. Well. Go. You can go home now. Marcello wants me to return after the funeral. He's right. All the women must stay at home. Me and the children, we're going to my mother's house. I'm staying here. May God protect them. I'm waiting for some answers. Take that! It's the third floor guy. He beats his wife. Really? Mom told me... French women can't control their husband. Are you French or are you a Calabrian? I don't know. Anyway, I won't get married. And what are we hearing now? Now? It's Mrs. Pianeli. First floor. Can't see anything. She misses her sink every other time. You're well informed. You're going to see my father? Yes. Where were you coming from? Aunt Antonia’s house. The women are there. I'm on my way to see grandma. Well, good night. It's the inspector. Good evening, gentlemen. Inspector Lebret. He's in charge of the case. He comes from Paris. Listen... After 15 years, you're almost French by now. And for that you made many sacrifices. But I also know your traditions. Your sense of honor. And that's why I came to see you. To warn you, against any reaction, let's say Calabrese... You know very well what I mean. You might do something that will harm you for the rest of your life. Everything you've built will be destroyed overnight. There are things inspector, that you can't understand. I didn't have to come. You would have settled that together, we would have had a few more funerals. But I'm a police officer, and as a police officer, I am in charge of, arresting the culprits, and the justice is in charge of punishing them. The French justice. Not the one in Calabria. Gentlemen. Think about it. One moment, I'm coming. Well, here's a visit. Good evening. Come on in. Close the door. Come and sit down. You know anyone in this hotel or did you come to see me? I followed you. So you had something to tell me? Will you go see my father again tomorrow? Maybe, why are you asking? Are you afraid of something? What's your name? Mima. Listen to me Mima. If you want me to protect your dad, tell me what or who you're afraid of. The men who killed my grandfather, can they also try to kill my father? If he doesn't know them, he's fine. Then he can't know about it. But if he knows them, he has to tell me. So I can protect him. You understand? Do you believe me, Mima? Grandpa didn't like the police. I know your family doesn't like the police. What about you? Aren't you cold without your socks? I forgot them but I'm not cold. So you live here? At the moment yes, until the end of the investigation. Where will you go next? Where there will be other assassins. But don't you have a house? Of course I have a house. But no family. So you're all alone. I also would have liked to be alone. Why do you say that? I wish I hadn't been born. Or born in another family. With normal parents. At my school they don't have these problems. When I was a kid, I also wished I had other parents. But when I ended up in boarding school. I felt lonely. And I cried a lot. And I realized I missed my parents a lot. The other day, Grandpa came at school, I pretended not to see him, because everyone was laughing at him. I was ashamed. Now he's dead. You know, your father is lucky to have a little girl like you. And you're lucky to have a father like him. Because your father is a good guy. Really? You mean it? I really mean it. All right, come on. I'll walk you home. It's late for a little girl. You know, I'm almost a woman now. It's true Mima, you're almost a woman. This is the first time I've been to a hotel. Don't say I came here. I swear. It will be our secret, ok? It was more expensive, but I have some information. You were right. This meeting was a trap. They shot him down. On the spot. If we get the police involved, we will forever lose face. We need to calm down Marcello and Salvatore. We have to wait until the funeral is over, and make the decision. It's the ones from Ventimiglia. They'll be at the funeral for sure. If they didn't come, they would betray themselves. Luigi has to make the decision. Why Luigi? It's not his father who died. You think of your father, I think of our children. We've already said all this. We're not going back. Now we know who are these bastards. We'll take up arms and settle this Calabrese style. By now they might be far away. We need to act now. All this is just talk. What are you doing? So you know who killed him? There are things you can't understand. But Dad... But if you die, what are we going to do? Come on, the others are waiting. During the funeral you stay here, you watch your sister and cousins. Dad! Mom doesn't want us to go into her room. I know, but today it's not the same. - Can I count on you? - Why? I have something to do, I'd like you to watch your cousins. - So that means they must obey me. - All right. In front of the man. I have to go, Annunziata is waiting for me.
