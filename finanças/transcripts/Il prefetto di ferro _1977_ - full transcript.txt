THE IRON PREFECT Come in! - Excellency, just a few minutes left. - Thank you. I wasn't sleeping, you know? Are we there? Not yet. I haVe to leaVe you alone for a while. Don't ask me anything. I'll get back on the train at the next station. - Good to see you again, sir. - Good to see you, too. - Any news? - Sir, the situation is worse than ever. People haVe no faith in the State; nobody's prepared to talk. Anyway, as soon as I receiVed yourtelegram, I started nosing around... I managed to pick up a little information. There are still a few who haVen't forgotten you, and are ready to talk. Well, that's something. - You weren't followed, were you? - No... but they knew of your appointment before I did, before the papers as well... probably even before you did! I haVe to admit I was amazed it was you they chose, considering the indictments you secured against the fascists in Bologna. Yes, it wasn't easy there. Anyway, that's past history. - Do they suspect anything about you? - No. As you know, they're not frightened ofthe police, but they're afraid of you! They still haVe perfect memories ofthe lessons you gaVe them when you were at Trapani, even though it happened many years ago. No, they don't suspect anything about me. Well, they don't suspect I'm one of your men. Major Spanò, you are not one of my men... because I don't haVe my own men. You're a... an officer ofthe Carabinieri that the State trusts, until proVen otherwise. We are both employees ofthe State, that's all. Now, let's try to get things going. The train won't wait. Hello, Vasile. - Be quick; we don't haVe much time. - Alright. Come in. This is Mr. Mori, from Rome. He's the one you wanted to talk with. - I'm honored. - Well? - Want some wine? - Thank you. - For you too? - Thank you. You must excuse the circumstances, Your Honour, but I'm sure that by the time you get to Palermo, we will no longer be here. We are leaVing for France; we haVe jobs waiting for us there. The barons haVe left their land to the mafia. The peasants are dying ofhunger. What little grain we manage to harvest, we haVe to share with the field hands. Our brother Alfio spoke out against them in public, and they killed him. He left three children, and now he's dead! - And those wolVes get fatter. - Who are they? Who's behind these killings? Who's getting fatter? Your Honour, you know damn well who's behind all these killings. They're the same ones you sent to jail, and are now free again. Your Honour, there's a notary in Bagheria; he handles all the business transactions. He'd know the names of everyone inVolVed. His name is Corcetto Tardisio. When Baron Salemi sold this piece ofland, he did it through him. And who bought this piece ofland? Someone called SalVatore Carruso, from Catania. He used to be a... hat maker. - Well, it's not much to go on. - Sir, you know these people: We're lucky they accepted to meet you. You know what they risk. Well, let's get going, Spanò. I haVe to catch a train. Just a moment... it looks to me like the train is running ahead of schedule. My respects, Sir. As a matter of fact, it's a few minutes late. But, if a train runs a few minutes late once in a while, - it's not going to kill anybody, is it? - Certainly not... - We're running late. Shall I report it? - Go ahead, you good-for-nothing! My respects, Sir. There's no hurry- I took the liberty ofhaVing the train wait until you got here. It would not haVe left without you. That was Very unwise of you; it's illegal to disrupt the schedule. I apologise, then. I only meant it as a token of consideration to you, and the authorities waiting for you in Palermo. I recognised you... you're Antonio Capecelatro, and you're free. Yes, that's right: It's true that I'm Capecelatro, as it's true that you're Prefect Mori... - I proVed my innocence. - I see that. Unfortunately, mistakes are made, even in the best judicial systems. I'Ve returned to Sicily also to correct those errors. I hope I'll be able to return your consideration Very soon. As soon as he arriVed, he got right down to work! He summoned all the local authorities... 278 homicides. 312 robberies. 59 cases of extortion. 65 cases ofliVestock theft. 18 kidnappings. Figures to make your head spin, if you considerthat they referto only one year, and to only one proVince: Palermo. And then, we haVe to take into account the fact that these figures can be doubled, by the crimes not reported to the authorities, forfear of reprisal. These figures serve to illustrate how the mafia has been able to create a state within the State. And it's no wonderthat the population, caught between the two, one too distant and inert, and the other on their doorsteps and actiVe, has chosen the latter. The problem isn't one of criminal audacity, but ofthe lack ofinitiatiVe on the part oflocal authorities. EVery citizen has to be persuaded that, ifhe's been wronged, it is not the mafia to he should turn for justice, but to the laws ofthe State. EVen ifit's an unfortunate reality that at the present time our legal system is... incapable, inconsistent, and sometimes irreparably compromised. Sir, you want us to delegate the judiciary's power oVerto you? Mr. Prosecutor, complete power is something I already haVe... Your precise job is to see that I'm giVen collaboration that is consistent, and also unconditional. Gentlemen. Finally the goVernment has decided to send down the right man. I think we all know who Mori is... Six years ago at Trapani, he had them crying tears ofblood. It's strange though... If I remember correctly, Mussolini sent the same Prefect to Bologna, where he even arrested fascists. Ah, he arrests anyone who breaks the law: Fascists, BolsheViks, anarchists, crooks... He is a man who is afraid of no-one. People trust him... He hadn't even arriVed at Palermo before he found someone prepared to talk. Just the mention ofhis name makes people feel safer. These will be difficult times forthose who break the law. Tears ofblood, the Baron said. In that case, I propose a toast to Prefect Mori: - May the Madonna keep him aliVe and well. - May the Madonna keep him aliVe and well. They killed him out here, because killing him on the doorstep is a double insult. But they didn't kill him just because he talked. You can take him away. Alright, come on. Pull yourselftogether: You're a soldier. Wait a minute, wait. Wait until afterthe medical team's been in there. It's fine, Spanò. I want to get inside before the others. We will never get used to this kind of sight... Close the door, Spanò. The dust is coming in. Why? A switchblade, an illegal one... A military man's shoe... All Victims ofthe bandits, Sir. Honest citizens. Don't blame it on the bandits - there's nothing in that house worth stealing. This has been done by the mafia, and you know it. Is this going to be another case ofinsufficient eVidence? These people believed in the protection ofthe State, and in me, who represents it. And they were killed to try and frighten me... to make people fear and mistrust everything I do. Lfthis saVagery goes unpunished, as it usually does, nobody will evertrust police forces again. Prepare a warrant forthe arrest of Antonio Capecelatro. But, Sir, may I suggest that we wait forthe Carabinieri's report on the crime? Prepare the warrant... tomorrow morning, I'll come and get it. Cesare... why don't you rest a while? - This heat is suffocating. - Would you like some fresh lemonade? No, I'd just sweat more. Sit down, keep me company. As you wish. There was someone singing this evening - did you hear it? - Yes. - He's stopped now. Probably because the song was finished. Nothing strange about that. Or he's dead. Who sings, talks, and nobody here can sing, nortalk. Why don't they show themselVes forwhat they are? Yes, face me as a true enemy. I will respect you more. The greetings and hand-kissing - just keep them for yourselVes. Embrace and shoot yourselVes in the mouth: But do it with each other. With me it doesn't work. I know you... I won't be satisfied until I'Ve thrown you all into jail for life. EVen if I haVe to be more mafioso than you... That's enough, Cesare, please. I can't bearto listen to you any more. It's become an obsession. Don't talk like this, at least when you're home. If we had a child, would you talk like this? Angela, we haVe no children. Sir, wait... Be careful. If you get shot, I'll end up being transferred to some dump. Here, caution is useless. All of Sicily has to know that Prefect Mori doesn't accept any challenge from the mafia. There they are, watching... They know all about everything; life, death and miracles. It seems like they'Ve been waiting for us. For once, I don't feel bad about it. Spanò, the state has to instill more fear in them than the mafia. Woman - where can I find Antonio Capecelatro? Hey... that way! - Who is it? - Prefect Mori. And what do you want, Sir? I haVe a warrant forthe arrest of Antonio Capecelatro. He's not here. Then tell him that I will wait... and also tell him that I am alone. Antonio Capecelatro- I know that you're in there. I'Ve come to arrest you, for disrupting a public service. Orfind another, more significant excuse, if you wish... and find the courage to come out ofthere. You made a big mistake stopping that train. You put your signature on the massacre ofthe Vasile family. Mori! This is the day we settle our account. This morning you haVe come to die on my territory. You should haVe stayed in Palermo, with your ass in an armchair, giVing orders! Sir? Sir... Wait... come here. I bet you like sweets, don't you? - Here, go buy some... - LeaVe him alone! We don't want charity from the State. Woman! Today it is the State that has freed you from fear. The State should free us from misery. In the name of His Majesty Vittorio Emanuele III, by the grace of God and the will ofthe nation, king of Italy... and according to Articles 421, paragraph 2, and 468 ofthe Penal Code, this court acquits the defendants, Sant'Angelo Vincenzo, Maniscalco Giuseppe, Crisaci Settimo, Crisafi Paolo, and Maniscalco Paolo, for lack of eVidence, and orders their immediate release, unless they're being held on other charges. This court is adjourned. Major Spanò, we only want to ask Prefect Mori one question... - Please... - Just one question. - Please! Excuse me, Sir, forgiVe the intrusion, but isn't it rather unusual to see a Prefect at this time and in this court room? Why unusual? A Prefect represents the State. In otherwords, let's say that the State... wants to look, straight in the eyes, those citizens that haVe pronounced this sentence. - Is that a threat, Sir? - Watch what you say, Sir! I know that witnesses haVe been threatened throughout the trial. When I arriVed, everything was already oVer. EVerything was already decided without me. Nobody can say that Prefect Mori is the one who pronounced this sentence. Good evening. That's enough for now. That's enough. My sympathies, Mr. Prosecutor. I asked that they be sentenced to life... But without witnesses, without proof... the court couldn't go ahead and condemn them, on pure hearsay. EVerything according to the law. But I didn't come here to blame anyone forthis scandalous acquittal, which makes us look ridiculous. In that case, to what do I owe the honour? I want you to appeal the Verdict that has just been passed by the court, because I haVe to re-arrest them, before they escape. But that's impossible. I cannot appeal, only to haVe them acquitted again. It would mean the end of my career. I promise you that you'll receiVe a promotion, and a transfer. No. I don't want any priVileges. The fact is that you're afraid, isn't it? Who are you afraid of? The mafia? You can't address me in this manner. I'll giVe you a choice: Either you appeal the court's decision, or I'll report you to the Minister ofthe Interior, and accuse you of anti-fascist actiVities! That's a lie! When you tell me you can't appeal within legal procedure, that's also a lie. What I want to know is... in this hall ofjustice, who is the mafioso? So? Very well... tomorrow, I'll sign the necessary order. No, not tomorrow: Now! Sir... I too wish to re-establish the dignity ofthe State, - but through proper legal procedures. - I don't ask for more. Perhaps you may be my guest one day, so we may exchange Views in priVate? Whenever you wish. I'll be glad to get out ofhere... Thank God... At your orders, Sir. Captain, I hold you responsible forthese uncalled-for and impromptu festiVities, between officers ofthe law and criminals. You'll haVe to excuse me, Sir, but these men haVe been acquitted. Tomorrow, afterthe usual formalities, they'll be released from Ucciardone prison. Tomorrow, they will not be released from prison. The King's Prosecutor has appealed the court's decision; these men will stay in prison. Here are the necessary papers remanding them into custody. I charge you to hand them oVer personally to the prison goVernor. Major Spanò- go with the captain and see that my orders are carried out. I hope you rot in hell! You son of a bitch! You scoundrels! You're gonna rot forthe rest of your life in prison. Spanò- these people must understand that nobody's immune to the law... nobody! - Come in... Honorable Galli. - Mr. Prefect. It's fresh offthe press. A special edition, dedicated to your appointment, emphasising the party's trust in you. I would haVe preferred less clamour. Please, take a seat. Thank you. You taught us that there's nothing more effectiVe than the press... in influencing public opinion, getting the public inVolVed... Public opinion is a double-edged sword. But I realize that... and I think the mafia realizes it too. A cigar? Er... no, thank you. I prefer my own. This is a new newspaper. For a new Sicily... for a new Italy. A newspaperthat will be at your side, throughout your arduous campaign. It will never hesitate to praise your Valiant efforts... to liberate this island from a centuries-old pestilence. I shall do everything that needs to be done, believe me. You will haVe the direct support ofthe Fascist Party, and of every fascist citizen. Excuse me... what do you mean by 'direct support'? That the Party is ready to intervene, on the side oflaw and order... to stamp out the mafia and anti-fascism, wherever it manifests itself. The problem is that the mafia seldom comes out in the open. However, I must thank you for your kind offer. It will certainly be taken into consideration. As far as the Party's concerned, I know that many petty criminals are... falling oVerthemselVes to join your membership, in the hope that it will giVe them a clean record. I'm conVinced though that you as Party... Secretary, would like to stop this indiscriminate in-flow. Believe me, I shall do everything in my powerto stop it, sir. In the meantime, allow me to offer you this small gift... I see you don't wear one. I thank you, but I'Ve always believed that whether you're a fascist or not, you don't need a badge to show it. - Mr. Mori, it's been a pleasure. - The pleasure was mine. No, it doesn't suit you. The brim's too tight. I don't like it. Let's try another one. - Let me see. - This one? - Yes, this is nice... Damn you! Damn you and your husband! All our husbands are being sent back to jail! Damn you! Stop! Are you crazy? It's my fault... I should never haVe allowed you to come to Palermo. I'Ve realised that they hate us, and consider us outsiders; enemies. That will change... All I need is time, but I haVe Very little. I must giVe them a positiVe result... and quickly, too. Would you rather I stay? I'm not frightened. I wish you could. But that's impossible. No, as long as you're here, I'm Vulnerable. They'll stop at nothing. And neitherwill I. Excuse me, Sir. The car is ready, and the train leaVes in 20 minutes. Thank you. Promise me you'll take care of yourself, that you won't expose yourself, and you'll keep in touch? Go. Go now. Chief of Police, Sir, His Excellency will receiVe you at once. Try to understand... it's been a Very hard day. Sir: I'm conVinced... that this tradition of delinquency is encouraged by nepotism, exploitation, illiteracy, the interference of politicians, extreme poVerty and malaria. - I take it you agree with me? - Yes, of course I do, Sir. Now, if you agree with me, then why don't you, as medical officer ofthis proVince, carry out your duties competently? Why has the distribution of quinine in outlying Villages... been non-existent or sporadic forthe past 8 months? And why are house calls by this proVince's general practitioners, as rare as white mosquitoes? Excuse me, Sir- there is a lack of qualified personnel. It's a large area to coVer. From tomorrow on, you'll haVe 200 policemen on horseback, forthe distribution of medical supplies. As for doctors, there are more than enough forthe job. It's your responsibility to ensure that they perform their duties. I'll expect a report on the situation within two weeks. - HaVe a good day. - Good day, Sir. - Ah, Chief of Police... - Morning, Sir, good morning. We're not doing good, Chief... - The soldiers... - HaVe you seen their guns? - Is there a war? - Are you Anna Torrini? - Hey! Are you Anna Torrini? Why? What is it? This box is for you. It's from the Town Hall in Palermo. It contains blankets, medicines and other stuff you need. Damn you! We don't need this stuff! Damn cops! Why haVe none of you ever died of cholera? In Vincenzo Torrini's house, we haVe bread on the table every day! We haVe clothes, wool blankets, wine and food... enough to blow our stomachs up like balloons! Damn you cops! There are no spies here! There are no spies! The determined action of Prefect Mori Commissioner Mori is haVing one success after another. He draws up the warrants himself, executes them, then he signs the indictments as well. It's nothing new; he's always done that. He has a free hand in this; we know the man. There are hard times ahead forthe delinquency that dishonours the island. Father Nicolò- where are you rushing to in this heat? You're perspiring all oVer. May the Lord protect you, Baron, but I'm rushing to see the Bishop. In regards to what, Father? In the confessional, one hears such Very strange things... Illicit romance, eh? I wish it were that. No, it is far more serious. Things that offend the Holy Church. - Don't keep us on tenterhooks, Father. - You can trust us... It concerns the Zagara estate - a property ofthe Vatican, as you must know - of which I haVe the honour of acting as administrator. The peasants no longer haVe any wish to work the land. They speak of strike, and in the meantime the harvest rots. They are all rebels. Besides, they feel protected by the new Prefect that the goVernment has sent us. "The Peasants' Prefect" is what they are all calling him. There are many otherthings they call him as well, Father. But don't worry: I'm sure the Holy Spirit will perform a miracle. - GiVe my respects to His Eminence. - Mine as well. Let's go. How did it go? The demonstration broke up. They'Ve all gone home. The man who organises them is Carmelo Lo SchiaVo. Let's go and say hello to him. Hey, officer! What are you doing, counting the sheep? You'd better be careful: They might make a run for it! Corporal - it's Dino's men. What should we do? See ifthat thing works. The Prefect in Palermo is so fond of modern things... Hello? Hello? Patrol 3 here... - My respects, uncle Carmelo. - My respects. Are you done with your politics? What brings you here? Uncle Carmelo! I thought you were a good Christian, respectful as we all are. Instead, I heard that you and the others... refuse to cultiVate the earth that belongs to the Church. - This is a sacrilege! - Who sent you? The Bishop? The Bishop? The Holy father himself sent me... You understand? What should I report? That tomorrow he'll find the wheat cropped and the sheaVes razed? I can't do that alone! And the others won't work ifthey aren't paid. What they get is a misery, but Don Niccolò won't even pay that. He talks about San Giuseppe, Sant'Antonio and the Madonna, but he never pays. Lfthe Holy father called you to HeaVen, I bet that you'd ask him to pay forthe trip! Don't tell me all this stuff- you just haVe to answer: Yes or no! That's what I haVe to report. - No! I can't! - You'Ve pissed me off! - Carmelo! - Traitor! You should be careful; you'll end up burning in hell if you carry on behaVing in this way. Carmelo! Hey! We're eating sausages tonight! Come here! Where are you running to? I'll be back tomorrow, and I want to find the land ploughed. - May you rot in hell! - Let's go! Well, Colonel. The field telephones served their purpose. First platoon, charge! Francesco, the Carabinieri! Second platoon, charge! Take aim! Who's the scoundrel that betrayed us? Francesco Dino, are you done? Get off your horse. Throw down yourweapons and dismount. And order your men to do the same. - Go ahead, Colonel. - Fire! I'm sorry, Sir. We didn't recognise you. We just happened to be out doing a bit ofhunting, Sir. You must believe me. I swear on everything that is holy! ForgiVe us, Sir. Colonel - put this filth in chains. Handcuffthe lot ofthem. It's him! Why has he come here? Woman - if you keep banging that shirt against the rocks, it'll end up full ofholes. It's already full ofholes. I sent some new clothes for your son; also blankets, books, medicine. But you didn't accept them. What did you expect? That with a little shooting... and some old clothes, you could come here and conquer all of Sicily... eh? I don't understand why you persist with your silence. Why will none of you help me? Don't you people realise that it's you who are always the first to suffer? I'Ve come here to fight the ones who are exploiting you. To fight the ones who are making you go hungry. To fight the ones who are murdering you. Yet you all behaVe as if you were on their side. We are not on their side... but not on yours either. You continue to insist that you will free us from this eVil... instead, you'Ve made things more miserable. That's not true! Things are changing here in Sicily. Is that so? They're changing? Come and take a look then! Let's go, Bruno. Hey, woman - get out ofhere. The child has to work. Go on... Sir, you talk about peace, about God, about the King... but nothing you say makes sense to me. I only know that the bandits... beat me up when they steal sheep. The boss beats me for any ofthe sheep that are stolen. And the police, they come up here and beat me as well, when they want to know the names ofthe bandits... That's all I know. What's yourfather's name? I don't haVe no father... and no mother. The boss found me on the steps of a church. You might not believe this, but we haVe something in common: I was abandoned on the steps of a church too. That's why I'Ve always believed in the State. In a Justice that's aboVe everything, even your own father and mother, and protects everybody. But you can't understand yet. Goodbye. My respects. Tell me something: Why do many of you call me 'Piemontese'? I'm not from Piemonte. It's a name we'Ve always giVen... to our enemies. Ristagni, are you really sure about this? SalVatore Caruso, hospitalized in this place? What should I tell you? SalVatore Caruso, the hat maker, the one you're looking for, is in there. They put him in there a year or so back. Now I'll be on my way, or I'll land myselfin trouble. - My respects. - UnbelieVable. May God be with you. Excuse me - are you SalVatore Caruso? The hat maker? ForgiVe me... I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'Ve come from Palermo, because I haVe a faVourto ask. Could you haVe a relatiVe of mine work your land, the land that you bought last year? Remember? The land that you bought from Baron Salemi. Salemi. The farm in Monte Fiorito. Remember? No, no. Someone else is taking care ofit. Ask them. So you really bought it? Hey! You! We don't allow this kind oftalk. - Look, I'm... - Well? I'm sorry. You're right. I appearto haVe the wrong person. So, according to the land office in Catania, this Caruso is the owner of 5,000 acres? - Right, sir. - But you just said he is a rundown old man, being taken care ofin a poor house in Catania. Not really being taken care of: I'd say he's more of a prisoner. I think his hospitalization has never been registered. Now I get it. They use the wills. What you mean is they find some old man with one foot in the graVe, and buy land in his name, worth a small fortune, and just wait for him to drop dead. And when that happens, who do you think inherits the property? The title deeds change hands continuously, and in the end you lose trace ofthe one... who really wanted to make the purchase, which is actually a theft. That's right. You'Ve done a good job, Spanò, but it's not enough. To be able to send these crooks to jail, we need the Victims to testify. But to get them into the court room, first we haVe to free them from fear. We'll begin with the bandit problem. First, the fugitiVes: We need to break up the strongest gangs. ...and hereby authorises the immediate requisition of any equipment... Hey! Let me in - it's the law! Let me in! Stop! What are you doing here in Palermo, Anna? I wanted to speak to you, Sir, but the policeman - he wouldn't let me in. Get in. - DriVe on. - Where do you want me to go, Sir? What do you mean? To my office. Come in. Who are they? Princes, kings... those who'Ve goVerned Sicily oVerthe years. You know what we say about them? Kings are the same as fleas: They go whereverthey want, sucking blood off whoeverthey want. Will they do a painting of you as well, one day, Sir? Of me? I Very much doubt it. Tell the truth: Did you come here to haVe me release your husband? My husband? Poor Vincenzo. I was just 16 when Francesco Dino, the bandit you arrested, arriVed at the house of my father, and took me away with him. Then, when he got tired of me, he chose some unfortunate man in the Village, and made me marry him. My husband... at least he won't starve in prison. Well then? If you want to show your generosity, then take my son away from here. Somewhere far away from Sicily, where nobody knows who he is. Out of reach ofthe eVils that persecute us. Is your son Francesco Dino's child? He... is my son! Gangi... it's the bandits' main stronghold; it's considered a safe hideout. People hide them, and support them. The bandits used to be in the pay ofthe mafia, but now they'Ve grown so powerful, that the mafia had to make a deal with them. They're all in there: Eight large gangs. And there's the greatest boss of all: Albanese, the patriarch. 27 charges ofhomicide, 45 years a fugitiVe. There's no doubt they're all in there... but wheneverwe try to carry out a raid, they melt away without a trace. And now you understand... why I ordered all those arrests? The Victims themselVes haVe become accomplices. There's nobody in this place who remains innocent. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye: By orders of Prefect Mori, all fugitiVes must turn themselVes in within 24 hours, otherwise this town will be occupied. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye... Out, out, out, out... get out ofhere! You're not allowed inside this church. You're not allowed in here. Get out, get out, get out ofhere! Uncle Calogero... Iook out there. - Why weren't we warned by the shepherds? - They arrested everyone. Don't worry about it - we'll kill them all. Will you fight against their cannons? May the Virgin Mary assist you. Uncle Calogero- there are police everywhere; they'Ve surrounded Gangi. No-one can get in or out - there're millions ofthem! I saw them. Let's go. We'Ve managed to surprise them. Forthe first time, there was nobody to warn them of our approach. Soldier... That's already a Victory. It's what comes next that's difficult: Catching them, and aliVe. I don't want any ofthem becoming martyrs. Those cowardly murderers will haVe to march in chains in front oftheir poor Victims. Only in this way, will the citizens begin to regain theirfaith in the State. Colonel - check the road blocks. No-one will enter or leaVe the town, Sir. - And requisition the animals. - Right away, Sir. Platoon to road block numberthree. Another platoon with me. Go to your hideouts. The town is completely surrounded. Nobody can get in, nor out. Don't worry. They'Ve neverfound us before, and they won't find us this time. Mori says he's going to slaughter us all. When the storm breaks... keep undercoVer. Do you haVe a piece of paper that proVes you own it? - Sergeant, come here! - At your orders. Spanò- I'Ve made my decision: I want the water main that serves Gangi cut off. But Sir, that's impossible. There are children up there, and women. In this heat, they're liable to die ofthirst. There are no oranges or lemons to make juice with. There are only bandits and rocks. When the children get thirsty, they'll all surrender quickly enough. They'll haVe no choice. Colonel, what's our situation? Sir! You can't cut offthe water. It's inhuman to treat women and children like the bandits. They wouldn't forget something like this, and it's against the interests ofthe State. Who the hell do you think you're speaking to, Spanò? This is war. We didn't come out here to attend a picnic. I want no casualties, which means we haVe to do something, right? A little thirst isn't going to kill anybody. Remember... when the taps run dry, theirfirst reaction will be one of panic, not thirst. They'll get scared before suffering from anything else. That's what I'm relying on. I cannot disobey an order, Sir, but I think you're wrong. Spanò- if you can't do it, you can ask for a transfer. And I'll haVe it take effect immediately. What do you want? - I want to see Don Calogero... right now. - Go ahead. Come forward. Well, what is it? They'Ve cut offthe water- there's no water. Without water, the children are soon going to die. Turi, and you guys, listen to me closely: Mori has cut the water main off. Tomorrow morning... I want to see as much water in Gangi as in the sea in Palermo. - Go now. - As you wish, Don Calogero. Go back to town. Tell them that Uncle Calogero says: - "Tomorrow, there will be water." - May the Madonna bless you. Where is the water? They haVen't come back! Where is the water? Where is the waterthat you promised us? Your nephews haVe been arrested. Where is the waterthat you promised us? You, man without word ofhonour! Your rule is oVer! Damn you! Holy Father, hear our prayerto you. Holy Father, hear our prayerto you. Water and salt, Holy Virgin Mary. Oh, free us from our curse. Water and salt, St. Joseph. Oh, free us from our curse. Water and salt, water and salt... Poison and bones oVer his graVe. Oh, free us from our curse. Water and salt, Holy Mary... Send us down your spirit. Oh, free us from our curse. St. Joseph, Holy Virgin, saVe us from our misfortune. Hold it like that, Sir... hold it... Major, Albanese the bandit is on his way here. Are you sure? Well, I can only see women. UnbelieVable... It's really him. - Prefect Mori was right. - Albanese, the bandit. HaVe someone warn the Prefect. Go away! Go! Sir, the bandit chief Albanese has surrendered. Take offthe handcuffs. I'd like to adVise against that, Sir. A man who has surrendered deserves our respect. He has recognised the State and its laws. Take them off. Now, leaVe us alone. Dismissed. Your surrender does you credit, but it's only the beginning. I haVe an important objectiVe here. I cannot achieve this objectiVe of mine without your help. We must liberate the people of Gangi from the other bandits. Piemontese... You can blind me if you like. You can whip me if you like. Cut off my balls if you like! I will never help you. - Those are things that you bandits would do. - That is true. We do them, and you call us bandits. You do otherthings. You create hunger, illness, wars, life sentences. Isn't that worse? I haVe not surrendered in orderto plead with you, show my weakness, or betray my friends. When I saw the women on their knees, begging the saints, it made me realise my honour was finished. A bandit liVes only ifhis people fear and loVe him. Otherwise, he dies. And I haVe come here to die in front of you, only to exchange my life forthe water that my people need. That way, I can keep the last promise I made as a man. I must ask you a faVour: Don't ever let me know the inside of a jail. GiVe me a razor, or some poison... No... I can't do that. If you want to kill yourself... you'll haVe to do it on your own. My sons! It's oVer! Albanese was just one ofthem; we still haVe to catch the others. Halt! Who's there? And ifthey don't come out, we won't be able to. What's going on there? What's the matterwith you? I'm the Mayor of Gangi. Take me to Prefect Mori. I must speak with him. - Go ahead. - Come on, moVe. Sir, I managed to escape. They are wild animals! In otherwords, you finally realised which way the wind's blowing. And you'Ve run for coVer. But we're not here to proVide protection. AfaVourfor a faVour. But of course. I'll help you if I can, Your Honour. Sure you can. Let's get it oVerwith. I want you to giVe me a plan ofthe town. And I don't mean the usual town plan. I want one of all the secret tunnels, that you allowed them to dig. But... I don't understand, Your Honour... You don't understand? Well, in that case I'll see that you're protected by an escort, and taken back to town. No! Just a moment, just a moment... Let me think about it... I'll try. - Very well, let me try. - That's better. Spanò- some paper and a pen forthe Mayor. Tomorrow, we'll launch our attack on Gangi. Look out! Here comes the army! Quick everyone, hide! The soldiers are coming. - What shall we do, sir? - For now, nothing. We don't need rifles here... picks are more appropriate. Let me haVe that. - MoVe this stuff. - Yes, sir. I'll go down first. It's my own responsibility. Sir, if you're not back in a few minutes, - I'll come in after you with the platoon. - Right. Walk, you little bastard! Come on! They're all hiding in these holes. Place a guard on this one, Colonel. Now forthe others. Yes, Sir. Post a guard in here. - Where are they hidden? - I don't know. Come on, where are they? I swear on the Holy Mother, I don't know where they are. What the hell are you doing? Who ordered you to do that? You're worse than the bandits. Out! - What'd the woman tell you? - Pick there. This is the place. Get those goats out ofthe way. Get him out ofhere. Continue. - Hold yourfire: They're surrendering. - We surrender! Out! Come out! Against the wall. Come on! These bandits are just cowards. Men without honour: They don't haVe the courage to fight. They stay hidden like mice. What did he do? Sir, he refused to take part in an action when ordered. Why? Sir, how could I? My brothers are in there. I was born here. Take him away. I want the name ofhis officer. And what's going on oVer there, Colonel? There's no way we can get in, Sir. It's like hell. Well, let's get it oVerwith. This is the family that was hiding them. What should we do with them? LeaVe 'em alone. We'Ve heard there's an entire family ofbandits down there: Father, mother and sons. They're holding a hostage, and haVe threatened to cut his throat if we go in. One ofthem tried to escape, but we caught him. - HaVe you tried forcing them? - No, Sir... we don't know how many they are, orwhere they are. - There's a maze oftunnels down there. - Well, we'll soon find out. I'll go down there with 10 men. The rest of you stay here. He comes with us. - I want to catch them myself! - But sir, it's too dangerous! Lfthey kill you, it'll be a fatal blow to the law. The law has already been torn apart here in Gangi, Spanò. Only a Victory can put it back together... maybe. Go ahead, follow the Prefect. - It's incredible, sir: They liVe like mice down here. - MoVe! Spread out - don't bunch up. Bring that bastard here! - You scoundrels, surrender! - No, father! Murderers, surrender! We'll tear you to pieces! We'll burn you aliVe! Shoot! You'll haVe no graVes, like animals! No, father, don't listen to him. You're just cowards! Murderers! Don't make me kill your sons! No, don't listen to him! Father, shoot! Kill him! We surrender! I'm Count De Caro. Long liVe the Carabinieri. Long liVe the Carabinieri! Finally, you're here to free me. Long liVe the Carabinieri! Disarm them. Against the wall, all ofthem. - Ready forthe picture? - OK. Are you ready? Wait, Sergeant, where are you going? You can stand next to this bandit. I'm going to take a beautiful picture. # Giovinezza (fascist song) # There they are. I figured they'd come pretty soon. You wanna bet that tomorrow all the papers are going to say it was... the fascists who cleaned up Gangi? We'Ve eliminated the bandits... now we're going to worry about the "gentlemen". I see you'Ve already heard the news. How could I not? Mori has practically become a household name in America. American journalists are writing that they need men like him to... clean up New York and Chicago. We'Ve been receiVing letters from a lot of Sicilian Americans; they're not happy with the bad name that Sicily is getting. OVerthere, if you're Sicilian you're automatically considered a mafioso. I think it's about time the goVernment intervened to giVe Sicily back her good name. The goVernment is watching. Baron, there is no need to worry: We're watching. What's going on? This is abuse of power! You're ruining me! I'll report you to the highest authority. This is an open Violation! Report me to whoever you wish. Get out ofhere and let me work. Your records are just a pile of frauds. Don't put your hands on me. How dare you treat me like this? Let go of me, let go of me! Here, Sir. HaVe some water. There's so much dust in here... it'll do you good. Look at that, Spanò. But this is Baron... Look here: General... With this eVidence, we should arrest half of Sicily. I'Ve waited 10 years for an opportunity like this. Let me handle it. I want you to arrest every one ofthem, Spanò: From the lowest... to the highest. Don't stop; sing. It's probably a fancy dress party! Onofrio Isuzio, Nicolò Andaloro, Nicolò Ferrarello, Cataldo Paternò, Calogero BenciVenni, Francesco PulVino, Giuseppe Amadore, Girolamo Ammirata. In the name of His Majesty, you're under arrest. Carry out your orders. How dare you? Take your hands off me. I'm a baron, you understand? Baron, my dick! Put the cuffs on him. - You're really doing a stupid thing. - We'll find out at the trial. Let's go. In your case, General, I'd like to aVoid using the handcuffs. Would you follow me? I thank you, sir. I'm at your disposition. This is a farce! This is all because ofhim. He wants to impress the goVernment! Who knows? Perhaps he has plans to become king of Italy? And you haVe fun arresting all these gentlemen. I'd like you to giVe him a message: That we are not a cheap, second-rate bunch ofbandits, like the ones you arrested at Gangi. We'Ve got some important friends in Rome. They know us there too, and they respect us. These hands are not made for jail! Jail has neverfrightened men ofhonour! The traitors haVe to be scared! Those that haVe blamed us! Don't lower your clean hands, Paternò! Keep them aboVe your head, like a thief who's been caught in the act. Mori... I'll soon be out; you'll pay forthis mistake! It's you who is going to pay forthe moment. Out there, all the people in Palermo are waiting... to see you arrested, with the handcuffs on yourwrists. Now take him out ofhere. Get him out ofhere! And the others as well. Out! Sir, excuse me. This'll be the first trial in Palermo... since yourtriumphant campaign against the bandits. Our readers are asking themselVes why the trial isn't being held... in another part ofthe country, to aVoid a biased judgement, considering the tense atmosphere in the city at this moment? There will be no more changes of courts. To aVoid biased judgements... all trials will be held in Sicily. - Sicilians must be their own judges. - I said, silence! Clerk of the court, call Carmelo Lo Schiavo. Carmelo Lo Schiavo. Carmelo Lo SchiaVo, rememberthat you are under oath. Well, Spanò, a whole year's work goes up in smoke ifhe retracts now. Your Honour, I would like to ask the witness, Lo SchiaVo, if amongst the defendants here in this court room... he sees the man who threatened to kill him, ifhe did not go back to work? - Yes, Your Honour. - Well, identify him. I recognize him... yes, he is the one: Francesco Dino. No! He's lying! Your Honour, he's lying. I'm innocent. Put him in jail. You can't do this to me! The old man's lying! Someone's framing me! This is an outstanding result! There haVe been no identifications forthe past 20 years, especially in an Assize Court. Amazing! From now on, no-one can be afraid to come forward and testify. Look at the Judge: He's speechless. - Well, now we can leaVe. - God bless you, Sir. - My respects, Sir. - Let's go. I'd haVe preferred, Sir, to handle these transfers with the minimum of publicity. In the last few days, from Rome, I'Ve receiVed certain information that has to do with... us, directly. The goVernment doesn't seem to be too pleased with us... with your recent radical actiVities. Perhaps they would haVe preferred more smoke, and less fire? Basically, goVernments would preferto haVe the press up in arms, than to haVe a specific and final inVestigation. ObViously, they're afraid that such an inVestigation could lead back to them. First platoon, to the docks. Second platoon, check the embankment. Get back, get back. Calogero BenciVenni... Nicolò Ferrarello... Francesco PulVino... Cataldo Paternò... Giuseppe Amadore... Girolamo Ammirata... Tonino Albanese... Vanni Dino... Francesco Dino... Vincenzo Torrini... Carmelo Dino... Giuseppe Ferrarello... - Salute the Duce. - Good evening, Mr. Deputy. A spectacle worthy ofthe pen of D'Annunzio, orthe colours of a Boldini canVas. A spectacle both strong and lyrical. A spectacle worthy of fascism. Check the embankment. You remember Caruso, the hat makerfrom Catania? Well, he died two weeks ago. That's a copy ofhis will. He's left everything to that poor house he was in. And look who he names as his executor: Mr. Galli, the Deputy. We'Ve got him this time, Spanò. Find out where Galli is, and don't let him out of your sight. He's the one who's pulling all the strings. Go to the State Prosecutor's office... tell him I want a fool-proof warrant for Galli's arrest. And tell him that there are documents in my possession... that will allow him to proVe the connection between... the fascist authorities and the local mafia... Now go. - Let me go, you son of a bitch! - Drop it, drop it... or I'II! Drop it! They'Ve killed the Prefect! Hold it. I want every one of you in here. MoVe! MoVe! EVerybody inside! MoVe! Come on! EVerybody inside! Gambini, close the door behind you. Shall we take him away, Sir? Stay right where you are, you two! - Bentini! - At your orders, Sir. Whose orders, Bentini? Call the Chief of Police. Now... someone's going to tell me which one of you shouted... "they'Ve killed the Prefect"? Who was it? Hmm. So, am I to understand that Galli resold the plot ofland... that Caruso left to the poor house? Yes, Sir, exactly. It was all quite legal. But, who did he sell it to? It seems not to be recorded here. The Galli file, please. You remember? Well? Sir, the Galli file is marked 'Confidential'. Rememberthat you're addressing Prefect Mori. As far as I'm concerned, no file is priVate. Unless of course, the file in question inVolVes somebody... more important? Is that how it is? Who? The... er... His Excellency, the Minister ofthe Interior. I want to know what's going on. Well, sir, that land was sold to the State, and they're going to build an airport, and a new headquarters for the Fascist Party. And where's the bill of sale? In Rome. We're waiting forthem to send a copy back. How much was it sold for? How much has the State paid for this stolen property? I don't know, sir. I'Ve only heard rumours... - What rumours? - They say that... - Well, what do they say? - They say... 1,000 per square metre. Where's Mr. Galli? It's too late, Sir. He seems to haVe disappeared. They say he's in Rome, that he was summoned by the Minister ofthe Interior. You can go now. Comrades. A day oflight welcomes a new era. The promise that fascism swore to Sicily has been kept to the letter. The criminality of centuries that has been the curse ofthis island... is now wiped out. And the credit goes to one man, a man who has gained the respect ofthe whole world, who has earned his place in history, and whose accomplishments haVe become legends! His Excellency, Prefect Mori! His upstanding skills haVe already been indelibly engraVed... by the Duce's praise. And are today rewarded by appointing him Senator, which will lead him to Rome, to sit among the fathers ofthe nation. The chief of goVernment has not forgotten the young fascist forces, who haVe neverfailed to support His Excellency Mori. And their courageous leader, comrade Deputy Galli, who, in this generous island of Sicily, will continue the work of Senator Cesare Mori. - Congratulations, comrade Galli. - I salute the Duce. Reverend, please proceed. No, don't shake hands with me... let's salute each other in the Roman style. - It will be more appropriate. - How right you are, Senator. Senator Mori! - Excuse me, Sir. - Ah, Spanò. With your permission, I'd like to take this opportunity to say goodbye to you, Sir. - How do you feel? - How do you expect me to feel? Me, I'm like a surgeon who has performed an operation... but not a complete one... that has caused suffering, without curing the patient. The people here will only remember me forthe pain I'Ve caused. - No, don't say that, Sir. - It's the truth, Spanò. And there won't even be any scars... Ah, by the way, I wanted to congratulate you: I heard about your promotion. Yes, my promotion... who knows why they did that? Anyway, I'Ve decided I'Ve had enough, Sir. I'm resigning. With you, I served the State... the bunch of Villains now in power are no longerthe State. If you don't mind my saying so, we committed a cardinal error. We forgot that the mafia is a whore, who sells herselfto whoever's in power. And that error's taken its toll. Anyway, there are otherways to make a liVing. I can't say that I agree with your decision, but you haVe all my respect. In this world, there's always been a tragic lack of men like you. - I was only doing my duty. - Goodbye, Spanò. Thank you, Sir... Thank you. - Come on, quickly. - Don't run! Where are we going? - Quick! - Wait! Come on, hurry now, come on. Mom! Mom! Take him, quickly. Mom!
