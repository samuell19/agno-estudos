It's Kevin. - [Elena] Whoa. - And I just wanted to say. - He does look like that guy we saw today. - I was thinking a lot about what you said to me last week on your birthday. I don't think that you meant everything you said, but it did get under my skin and it did get into my head. I do think that if we're gonna repair our relationship, that you do need to find a way in which you can make it up to me, in a way in which pleases me and gets me to where I need to be. ♪ Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica ♪ Jessica, I'm gonna tell you this once and I'm gonna tell you this only one time, because I don't have any more time. Just call me back, just talk to me. I can't take the this any longer. I can't fucking take this any longer. So call me back and talk to me so we can get in the same room and I can fucking smell you again. Come on. Hi Jessica, it's Kevin. I've been driving for like eight or nine hours just on my way to Santa Fe to see you. And it's a little lonely on the road. It's like nothing around in like any direction. It's just making me feel extra lonely. So I'm just sending you things, that makes me feel better to just send you videos. So I'm gonna like keep doing that. Okay, Jessica, you need to wise up to what's coming to you, because if you keep fucking ignoring me like this, I'm not gonna play take it easy when I see you, when I get to you. It's not gonna be fun for you, it's not gonna be fun for me. So just answer my texts, answer these calls and get back to me. - And that's just two weeks worth of letters. You mind if I go take a shower? - No, go for it. (wind gushing) - Jessica! Jessica! (suspenseful music) Jessica. Jessica! Jessica! (suspenseful music) Jessica! (door knocking) - Jessica. - [Jessica] Yeah. - Kevin is outside. - [Jessica] What? - Kevin is here. - [Jessica] What are you talking about? - Kevin is outside. - That's not funny. - [Elena] I'm not joking. Maybe he followed you from Santa Fe. - That's not possible. - [Elena] Maybe he tracked your phone or something, I don't know, but he's here. - Hold on. (suspenseful music) - [Kevin] Jessica! Jessica. - What is going on? - [Elena] He's still here. - Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. (suspenseful music) - [Jessica] Who is that? - Jessica. - It's Kevin. - Jessica. - That's not Kevin. - It's Kevin! Jessica, hey, Jessica. - What do you mean? - It's not Kevin. - How is that not Kevin? - [Jessica] Because it's not. - Who is it then? - I don't know, why is he saying my name? - Because it's Kevin. - That's not Kevin. - [Kevin] Talk to me, Jessica! - [Elena] What the fuck? Where'd he go? - I'm leaving. - What? - [Jessica] I'm getting outta here. - Jessica. Jessica. Is there something you're not telling me? - [Jessica] Nope. - Why do you think that's not Kevin? - Because it's not. - [Elena] Who else could it be? - [Jessica] I don't know. - [Elena] Jessica, wait, don't go outside Jessica, you have a stalker, I'm trying to help. - [Jessica] You can't help. - What are you talking about? Jessica, can you please just explain to me what's going on? (ominous music) Oh fuck. Okay. So that wasn't Kevin. - Obviously. - Because Kevin is dead. - [Jessica] Exactly. - So - That was Kevin's ghost. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, Jessica, Jessica, hold on, whatever happened, you can tell me. (suspenseful music) (car engine revving) (car engine revving) - [Kevin] Jessica! Jessica! - What the fuck? - [Kevin] Jessica it's Kevin, Jessica. (car engine revving) Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica. (car engine revving) (suspenseful music) - Oh my God, what the fuck? (window knocking) - You are not crazy, this is happening. Just come back. My grandma was a mystic and a romantic. And when my grandpa died, she cast a spell on her land to reconnect with him. So when you brought Kevin's body here, the spell summoned Kevin's ghost. - So how do I get rid of the ghost? I get rid of the body? - No, that won't do anything. There are three ways to get rid of a ghost. One, the ghost chooses to leave on its own. Two, you get another ghost to kill the ghost. Yes, ghosts can kill other ghosts. Or three, you give the ghost what it wants. - He wants me. - I know. Don't worry, he can't come inside. So you're just gonna stay here, you're gonna relax. And I'm gonna take care of everything. - The fucking things that we've had together. And she doesn't even care. She's just wandering around. Not even paying attention to me. Acting like I wasn't there watching her. Please I've done so much for her, I've done so much for Jessica. I've sent her letters, I've sent her phone calls. I've sent her emails, I've talked to her. I've sent her messages. I've been on road trips to her house and she doesn't come out to answer because I'm like an idiot to her. I'm invisible, I'm walking around like a stupid person. And I wanna do things for her and I want to be her. I wanna kiss her, I wanna love her, I wanna tickle her. I wanna see her calves and her legs and her thighs. I mean, there's everything about her that I want. - He's a ghost. - [Kevin] When I see the stars and I. - He can't do anything. - And I see her and my love is for her, and it's in the stars. - [Elena] He doesn't even know he's a ghost. - It's for her. And she doesn't love me, she doesn't appreciate anything I do. And I'm deep for her and I'm wide for her. And it's confusing because my whole life is about her. My supreme life is about her and she doesn't care. And that's frustrating for me because you know, it's not the first time that I've been in love. And I see her and I'm in love with her. Okay, I said it, I said it, I said it, I'm in love for her, with her. It's fucking Valentine's day everyday for her and she doesn't appreciate it. She appreciates nothing that I've done for her. And it's not fair, it's not fair. I mean, I've been the guy here suffering, I've been the one suffering. She acts like, she's the one who's suffering, which is not real. You know, I'm the one who's out here waiting for her and giving her everything that I can muster. And she's not giving me anything. And that's not fair, that's not fair for me as a man who works hard, who makes money, tries to get a love. Okay, when you see someone who loves you, you accept that, you don't say no, you don't go. That's not gonna come around again in your life. That's not gonna come around, Jessica. That's not gonna come around! - [Elena] He's not gonna stop. - And you should see it when you know it and know it when you see it. And it's right here, plain as day. So see it, don't see it, I'm still gonna be here. I'm not saying what she is. I'm not saying what she is, is mine, that's stupid. It's not a law, it's not a law that I have a right to you. It's not about rights. But it is about desserts, about what you deserve. When you give this much, you deserve something back. That's what it is. People think that I don't understand that, but I do. And for me, there's many things that I do deserve that people don't understand. One Jessica, because you know. Okay, I understand it's not people, it's society, they're brainwashed into thinking, give everything to your job, give everything to your money. But for me, you just give it to a person. That's what it is. That's all that matters. You know, and people don't seem to really understand and grasp the true essence of what that means. Because for me, it's clear, it's simple. And for Jessica it's not. And that that's part of my mission. Get her to understand, get her to see, get her to open her eyes and her heart, not only to me, but to the world around her, which she doesn't understand. The beauty, the power, she doesn't get it. And it's sad really, because I'm trying to just do what I can for her. And she's blind. She's deaf, dumb and blind. And I'm trying to make her speak here and talk. And I keep saying, people go, "Hey, Kevin, what are you doing? "Why are you spending all your time off this one person "who doesn't even like you?" Well, A, that's not true. B, it's better than money because there's one thing important in life and that's people. And if you don't have a person, you don't have a person, and that's sad. You gotta get one. You've gotta get one. Even if they don't know it's you, you gotta do something to get her or him. People don't seem to understand that what I'm doing is not some sort of like, thing, okay, it's real. It's not my job. Okay, it's not my job. It's not my hobby. It's it's my purpose. (gentle music) Jessica. I don't get it, I don't get her sometimes because she is kind, well to me. But I've seen her be kind, I've seen her be smart. I've seen her be not really funny, but you know, silly. Well, not really. I do think that she likes me. I do think that there's a possibility here because maybe she hasn't shown it, but anything is possible. People who say nothing is possible are stupid. [Kevin mumbling indistinctly] - Kevin. - Who are you? - I'm Elena, I'm Jessica's friend. - Jessica? - You don't know where you are, do you? - Excuse me? - You feel a little lost, a little confused. Any idea how you got here? - I'm- - Nothing, right? - Where is Jessica? - You're a ghost, Kevin. - What? - You're a ghost, you're dead. - No, no, I'm not. - You are. - What are you, crazy? - Touch my hand. See, you're a ghost. Ghosts can only touch other ghosts. It's over. Move on. - But Jessica. - [Elena] You can't touch Jessica. - I can't touch Jessica? - No, you can't touch Jessica. - I can't touch Jessica. I can't touch Jessica. I can't touch Jessica. I can't touch Jessica. (gentle music) (wind gushing) Can't touch Jessica. Can't touch Jessica. Can't touch Jessica. Can't touch Jessica. Can't kiss her lips. Can't hold her hand. I can't brush her hair. I can't be with Jessica. I can't be with Jessica. I can't be with Jessica. But I'm still with Jessica. I'm still with her. I can still talk to her. She can still hear me. I can still be there for Jessica. I can still be there for her. I could be there for her more than ever. I don't have to eat. I don't have to sleep. I don't have to work. I can just be with her. I can listen to her. I can talk to her, all day long, I mean, this is good, this is a good thing. Yeah, this is good, this is good, yeah. (cow mooing) [Kevin] Jessica! Jessica! I'm here for you, Jessica. I am here for you now, I'm here for you forever. I'm here for you in a way I have never been before. I am present for you. I could be at your side, always. I am here to help you forever and ever, Jessica. Anytime you need me, I will be there. I will be your man. I love you, Jessica. I love you. And I want you to take me however you want. And I will be here for you every second of every day, every second of every night. We can do it, Jessica. It's a fact, you and I can be together. It's not a mystery. It's not against the law. We can do this. We can do this, Jessica. That's all that matters. I'll be at your side, at your doorstep, under your bed, behind your door, wherever you may go, I will be there. I will be supporting you and loving you and together we can grow, Jessica, we can grow together. Anything you need, I can provide. I devote myself to you. I am here for you, Jessica. I can see you and hear you. Before I couldn't do that. Now I can. I love you, Jessica. I love you with all my heart. - At that point, it was clear, Kevin, wasn't gonna leave her alone. So we had to try the next thing, which was finding another ghost to take care of him. - You mean another ghost to kill him? 'Cause only a ghost can kill another ghost. - Very good, you were listening. (gentle music) Four years old. - [Jessica] Where did that come from? - [Elena] That came from the grave of David Buford. - [Jessica] Who's David Buford? - {Elena] I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. (animals howling) David? Are you David? - Where's my cows. - You looking for your cows? - Yeah, my cows. - [Kevin] Hey. What is this? Excuse me. - You see that guy over there? - [Kevin] Are you trying to see Jessica? - That guy has your cows. - He has my cows? - He killed your cows. - He killed my cows? - [Kevin] Who are? What is this? Are you here to see, Jessica? - [David] You killed my cows. - You can't see, stop, you can't see Jessica. You can't see her. Get outta here freak. - [David] You killed my cows. (Kevin screaming) (crows cawing) (suspenseful music) - Do you see Jessica? Do you see what I've done for you? I can protect you. I can keep you safe, Jessica, only me. I can keep you safe. (suspenseful music) - Okay, didn't work. - You know any other ghosts? - [Kevin] I will support you, I will protect you, for the rest of your life. - Not really. - Okay. Let's just give him what he wants. - He wants you. - [Kevin] And I'll be there for you for the rest of your days. I'll never leave you Jessica. Yes. Jessica. Come to me. Finally, you understand Jessica. You understand everything now? Yes? You see me and I see you, Jessica, yes? We are the same. And you've always loved me, Jessica. You've always loved me. And I see that now. You've cared for me in the way I've cared for you. - [Jessica] I killed you. - What? - I killed you. - No, you wouldn't do that. - I did. I stabbed you on my front porch. Do you remember? - I do. (insects chirping) (wind gushing) (door banging) I do. - Do you remember how that felt? - Yes. It was scary. It was cold, Jessica. And I was alone. I was alone. It was so sad. It was terrible, Jessica. It was a terrible feeling. Jessica. (Kevin gasping) - That's how you made me feel every day, Kevin. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jessica. I'm sorry, Jessica. I'm sorry, Jessica. I'm sorry, Jessica. - [Jessica] That was different. - [Elena] Yeah. - [Jessica] He actually heard me. - [Elena] Really? - [Jessica] Yes. I actually feel like he's gonna leave me alone now. (truck engine revving) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Elena] All of this is my grandma's land, so nobody will find the body here. - [Jessica] You sure it's deep enough? - [Elena] Yeah, this actually isn't the first time I buried a body. - [Jessica] I didn't enjoy killing him. - I know. It's okay. It's over. (wind gushing) (gentle music) - [Kevin Voice] Hi Jessica, it's Kevin. I've just been thinking of you a lot lately. And I'm thinking about what you're gonna say when I get to Santa Fe and what you're gonna do, if you're gonna actually be interested in me. (fire crackling) That's gonna be something that's like, I drive all this fucking way and you don't even care. (Kevin crying) I just miss you so much. I just really want to talk to you. I'm just sort of scared to think about what could be, what we could be together. If you just. If you just fucking open yourself to me. And I swear, I'm not gonna do that anymore, I'm not gonna punish myself, I'm not gonna hit myself, I'm not gonna hit you, I'm not gonna hit anything. I'm just gonna be gentle with you. And I just want you to be gentle with me because I've shared so much with you and it's really, it's really making me feel so much. I'm just scared. And I just need to be in your arms. It's been so fucking long. (car engine revving) (birds chirping) - [Elena] So what are you gonna do now? - [Jessica] I'm going back to California. - [Elena] Well, I hope we stay in touch. - [Jessica] For sure.

Maybe we just walk together? - [Kevin] Yes. - [Benny] Kevin? - [Kevin] Yes, Benny? - [Benny] We're friends, aren't we? - [Kevin] Yes Benny, yes we're friends. Yes, of course. - [Benny] Good. I just, you know, was checking. - [Kevin] We're definitely friends, friends do this. We walk together. - [Benny] Yeah. But where are we walking now? - [Kevin] I don't know, Benny, I just feel we should just keep going straight and see what happens. - [Benny] Yeah. Maybe, maybe this is the end. I don't know.
