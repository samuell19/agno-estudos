I JUST DON’T KNOW WHAT I’M GOING TO DO WITHOUT MY OLDEST FRIEND. RICH ALWAYS SAID THAT THE CURE FOR ANYTHING WAS SALTWATER. TEARS, SWEAT, OR THE SEA. RICH THOUGHT THE GREATEST GIFTS IN LIFE WERE FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, AND FORGIVENESS. IF YOU HAD THOSE THEN YOU HAD A RICH LIFE. I KNOW HE GAVE THOSE TO ME AND TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HERE. HE’LL BE SADLY MISSED. MAY HE REST IN PEACE. HOW DO YOU EVEN BEGIN TO BOX UP SOMEBODY’S LIFE. WELL, YOU CAN START BY MAKING THREE PILES. ONE TO GIVE AWAY, ONE TO DONATE, AND TRASH. AND YOU KNOW WE STILL NEED TO FIND LILLY A HOME. ONCOLOGY-TRASH. DONATE. TO WHO, WILL? ARE YOU ASKING OR ARGUING? I’M NOT ARGUING, I’M EXPEDITING. I DON’T KNOW HOW THIS IS SO EASY FOR YOU. I’M NOT TELLING YOU HOW TO PROCESS YOUR FEELINGS. RICH DIDN’T LIKE PEOPLE TO BE SAD. THAT’S ALL. I JUST DON’T GET YOU. AND I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU’RE SO HELL-BENT ON GIVING LILLY AWAY SO FAST.
