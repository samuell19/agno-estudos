-You're packing too much. -So? -Whatever, just hurry. -Don't start, we're on vacation. We leave when we leave. Easy for you to say, you're not driving at night in winter. Please, it's not even 11 yet. It's a 4-hour drive to Braşov. At this pace, we'll be leaving at 2. Relax, we'll be ready in an hour. -I didn't sleep well last night. -Why not? You kept typing. The hell you didn't sleep. -I didn't sleep. Why don't you believe me? -Because you snored. You didn't have any problem. I kept waking up, it wasn't restful. When they invent a silent keyboard, buy me one. Anyway, we have to drop by Mamone's by lunch, so relax, we'll be ready in an hour. Say what? We drop by Mamone's, have lunch, then move on. We won't be there in four hours if we stop by your grandma's. Five, then. -Were you planning on asking me? -Ask what? If I felt like it. Do you ever ask if I feel like meeting with your family? If I felt like... It's not that I didn't feel like to visit your grandma. It's not fair to find out now that we have to stop in Mureş, too. I'll be away for the holidays. It's just an hour with grandma! So spend the holidays with them! -You wanted to spend Christmas together. -Not like this. Not driving cross-country so you can chat with your folks. Do you ever think about me at all? It's my turn. We spent last Christmas with your family. It's my family! Of course we did! True, but you drag me there too. They only fight through you anyway. Right. You don't seem to enjoy it much either. Now you've crossed the line. I didn't even mention my father. A night at mum's won't kill you! I'm a fucking idiot, I swear. I should be in Vatra Dornei. I could visit my father too! -Meaning? -Just that! So admit you don't want to come, don't give me that keyboard bullshit. I did want to, tough as it is. But you always do this! You fail to mention things! You didn't ask about your grandma, you just informed me. This kills me! -Tell it to my face, don't ambush me! -If I do, you never want to go with me! Do you mean we're not... We're not going anywhere. The others got there two days ago and I'm roaming like an idiot. -You really don't want to go. -Not anymore. Fine. Then I'm not going anywhere either. Then don't! -I'm going home. -Fine! -I am, you know. -Great. Every damn time we pack the fucking car full. Jump in front of a car, I'm freezing! That one had a radiator in the car. What a thickhead! It's useless, nobody takes this road. Listen... I think you should expose yourself more. -Wave properly! -I am, but there aren't any cars. Wave to the road! -You're standing there, freezing! -So stand still. Maybe this one... -Give me the lighter. -Wait. First entrance. Man, this town is just... Frozen. -Looks like a village. -You'd still see someone in a village. There's the old man, still with Mariţa. How are you, dad? Look who it is! I thought I heard your voice. -Good afternoon. -Hello there! -Hello! -How are you, sir? Getting old and feeling sorry for it. Former schoolmates. Remember them? Yes, of course. Come on, you're not that old. I don't feel old, miss, but people call me so. The guys at the philatelic circle call me Uncle. -Only because you're from Moldavia. -So are half of them. They just use the local accent. -How did you get here? -We hitchhiked. You remembered where I live? As you can see. Smart like your father! I'm from Bârgaie. We're spending the holidays there. They need to use the bathroom. OK. -Are you hungry? -No, thank you. I don't have any food. This woman cooks only for two. So it doesn't go bad. I told her: what if someone came over? There is a bit of pottage left, I thought you were coming alone. Don't worry, dad. What can I get you? Coffee? -Anyone? -I'd like some... Yeah, me too. The machine's there. I don't know how to use it, but you're free to try. I'll do it, after I go to the bathroom. -You didn't go? -Where is it? One right, one left. -You have two bathrooms? -What do you think? Of course! I'll go too then. -You have all you need there. -They'll manage. Right. -So? On your way home? -No, to Vatra Dornei. -Oh, you're not going home. -No, I'll go afterwards. Mother rented a cabin for all of us. -Really? -Adi and Iuli are coming too. You could come too, you haven't seen them in a while. -What will your mother say? -Nothing. She knows I dropped by. I don't know, you've caught me off-guard... I have to give you some money too, don't I? Forget the money. We'd all be together again. We could all stay here tonight and leave tomorrow with Mariţa. All who? We can drop them on the way. I haven't seen them in ages. I don't know. What do you say? -Fine, I'm coming along. -Good. -Won't Mrs. Melania mind? -Yeah, right. -Some wine? -No, thank you. Or... I thought we could all stay here tonight and leave in the morning with Mariţa. What do you say? I'd say yes, but Ali is expecting us. What do you think? I'd like to stay, too. We didn't say we'd arrive today. Can they, dad? Of course! We don't have four rooms for nothing. Plenty of space. OK. Let's have some coffee then. -Would you, miss? -Right, I forgot. While Andreea's making the coffee I'll show you some awesome stamps. Hey, guys? -Yes? -Come on! Oh, I forgot. He can't bring them here. -Adi... Costi, did you do what I asked? -What? Did you get those envelopes signed? I didn't have time to go to the theatre. The actors on them are in Bucharest, not in Cluj. And no one ever gets there? Beligan, Arşinel, Stela, they act in Bucharest. But Cluj is a big city, don't they bring plays from Bucharest? Yes, but I told you chances were slim. They're even slimmer here. -Ok, I'll try. -There you go, help your old man a bit. These are all the stamps in Russia from '45 to '90, the Soviet Union back then. And here I have a surprise. Look, politicians. Here are high officials, leaders. -What? -It looked weird. Here, great painters from Russia. And there's Gagarin. -Where? -Here. This one is very rare. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Hello! Hello. Good afternoon. -Hello, Costi, how are you? -Fine. -I wasn't expecting you. -Didn't dad tell you? I forgot to call you. He let me know an hour ago. She must be Ana, right? -No, she's a friend. -I'm Andreea. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. -You could have told me we had guests. -I forgot. I'm not ready for guests. I could have bought something. -You're hungry, right? -No, I asked. We haven't started with the preparations yet. Costi, thank you for bringing me guests without telling. Can I come in for a second? I'm sorry... I spoke with my father and thought it was enough. I met them on the way. He didn't know they were coming. -Come on. -Where are you going? To hitch a ride, where else? Come on, don't. Costi, I didn't mean you. Why are you leaving? -Hey. -Never mind, we'll talk. Wait a minute. I'll drive you. -We'll find a ride. -The hell you will. -Won't she be even more upset? -So what? Now I can't go see my boys? I'll be back in five minutes. Here. See? -Do you have an ice scraper? -Of course. I have everything. -Except for a shovel. -That I don't. I had a good, foldable one. -I think I left it in Suceava. -Yes, it's back home. Wonderful piece, made by a craftsman from my factory. Not like that, boy. Like this! My way's better than nothing. Come on! I'll fix it. There! You take care of this, I'll check the antifreeze. We have to get some on the way. -Let's see if it starts first. -Of course it will! This car has been through a lot. I crossed Tihuţa in third. The gearshift broke in my hand. Dear girl, please see if the documents are in the glove compartment. Is it open? We'll pay the road tax at the gas station. How did you break the gearstick? I just changed gears, it got stuck in the third. Sure, laugh! I could have died. You've always been lucky. The birds have been shitting on you. Maybe. You make your own luck. I'm handsome and smart, how could I not be lucky? Hop on! I paid the insurance last summer, but I don't remember for how long. Three months, I bet. No, it's either 6 months or a year. -It's cheaper for one year. -Are these phone cards? Yes. Cool! Let me see. -Will you go get it? -It fell off? Just a second. Did you find it? Yeah, but... Smart like your father! Good boy! -It'll hang on. -Not good! That's that. It'll do. A truck ran over it. We'll fix it. -Cold, isn't it? -Yep. -It fell again? -No. Right, I'd forgotten. -Did you bring me any phone cards? -You don't forget a thing. -Andreea can give you hers. -Really? -Will you? -Sure. I'll give them to Costi. He wanted some from France, I was there last year and promised I'd bring him some. Those are all right too. I'd be grateful. Yes, of course. There are no more public phones in Paris either. -Really? -He wouldn't believe me. Isn't that a shame! Fix that thing. Close that door, we're freezing. This car is a henhouse. I'd forgotten how cool your father was. He never stops talking! 37, 38... 50, your change. And your flyer. Have a nice day. -Hello. -Hello. Which pump? If you don't know your own pumps... I can't know your car. -That white Dacia. -Pump no. 5. They're numbered. What if I charged more for a different pump? 100 lei, please. Don't be grumpy, I was kidding. Anything else? -On the same bill? -Yes. -Should I get that? -Don't worry. -Do you know about our promotion? -No. -If you refuel for at least... -Forget it, it's late. -How much? -107,4 lei. -So the water cost... -4,5. Man. -7 lei and... -40. Any change? Yes. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. What was that promotion? Bullshit. You win something if you gather some dots. -What? -Don't know. Snow chains. On Dacias, the fan runs permanently. With your car, it's triggered by... -The thermo switch? -Right, that. Mine's always running and it was too cold outside. -And sticking the newspaper in... -Keeps out the cold air. What are you doing with those? -There's another under the seat. -Where? You take them. Put them back! Is that how you keep your collections? They're from the last philatelic circle meeting. Why do you need cards? You've been gathering stamps for 30 years. 30 years, from '75 until now? -And what good are they? -What good? -After your mother got me divorced... -Got him divorced! Well, didn't she? You didn't make her life easy. You know, the indiscretions of youth. Youth? You were over 50! I've always been a late bloomer. -What was I saying? -After the divorce... Right, I took the stamps with me. The rent was 4 million. The heating, another 1,5 million in winter. Plus phone. No, no phone. TV, cable, electricity. I was short of cash. On weekends I'd go to the philatelic club and sell stamps for 500-600 thousand lei. I'd come home with a good wine, a good brandy. How are your collections still complete if you sold them for booze? Excuse me, lads, I have to take a leak. We'll be at our place soon. No, it'll be dark soon. Mariţa doesn't like it. Her headlights are a bit dim. Somewhere around here. How long will you be in Vatra Dornei? My family's been there for two days. A couple of days, maybe. -What about Christmas? -Home, in Suceava. I hope you're spending New Year's Eve with Ana. It's none of your business! I don't know. -I was just asking. -We have nothing planned. Mr. Sandu is really agile! I only used duplicates for buying booze. I never touched the collections. -Where do I drop you off? -In Mureşeni. I visited a chick here once, through one of those dating ads. She was a Romanian teacher. Pardon me, miss, I talk and think dirty. Don't worry about it. Here somewhere. Yes, here. The third one from the big house. She used to end her letters: "With hope." Aurica was her name. She was 42. I stayed with her for a week. There was something drawing you to Transylvania. I would have liked to settle here. I felt so good. She was a homemaker. She wasn't all that clean. She'd wipe the floor with the dish cloth. But here's what happened. One morning, I go get some cigarettes. What did she smoke? Winston. I smoked LM or something light. There was a fair, women were selling wild strawberries. You know how they sell things by the road. Yes, mushrooms, apples, cranberries. Whatever's in season. Right? Chanterelle, too. Awesome mushrooms. So I go to an old lady. She had these big wild strawberries. "How much, auntie?" Auntie... She was just a bit older than me. "How much for the kilo?" "How about 15 lei, dear?" "How much do you have here? Weigh it." She had two kilos. "-How much is that?" "-30." "I'll give you 35, they look delicious." She was so happy. Then I go home. She made wonderful cakes. I wanted them with sugar, but she made them with sour cream. I give her the cigarettes, the fruit. "Here, do this and that with them." "Was there no flower pulling you by the hand?" she says. She got straight into it. "Look, I've never given flowers to women in my life." "I know it's a bad habit. It's just who I am." "Plus, there were no flowers." But she knew better. "They're around the corner." The truth is I didn't see them because I didn't look for flowers. "What now? Do I go get you a bunch of..." "Am I supposed to be all smooth-tongued and stuff?" "Win your heart with flowers?" "Sure, it's nice, I've just never done that." "It's my mistake. Maybe that's why I'm alone." When I saw that... And you got upset just because of that? She had a daughter studying in Cluj. "Where will she stay after graduation?" I ask. "I'd like to bring her here, to live with us." When I heard that it all became clear. She was pretty, but a bit chubby. That's it, boy! Now give your father a cigarette. -Don't have any. I've quit. -Did you? I have some. -Here. -Thank you. Take them all, for the road. I only smoke on special occasions. At the philatelic club and when the boys come visit. Come spend New Year's Eve with us. At a cabin. With children and everything. We'll see. We'll be in touch. Mummy! What are you doing out, it's cold! Bye! Have a nice trip! -How are you? -I'm fine. -See, we got here sooner. -Bye! Bye! Have a nice trip. I've brought you something. We're starting to climb. Good thing they cleared the road. -Will we manage to cross Tihuţa? -With Mariţa? Damn sure. -Was that their kid? -Who else's? He's pretty big and I've never seen them with him. They do what they can. He stays with their parents when they're busy. You also used to ship us off to grandma in Budeni. Your mother went to university, I had my job. You had two jobs. One was chasing skirts. I enjoyed life, somehow... In my mind, in my view. We each have our own view on life. Yours was a bit more special. True. We're men, aren't we? -Was it you or Adi? -When? In Budeni, you were little. You or Adi, I can't remember. Like you ever knew. I took Adi from your grandma, then went to my sister in Siliştea. I started pouring in wine, plum brandy, the works. I was as drunk as a lord. Very, very drunk. -I put the boy on the back seat. -Who? Adi or you. I thought I'd drive slowly, so he wouldn't roll over. I don't know how I got home. I don't know how I got the car into the yard. I got inside, stayed there for a bit. -The boy was still in the car. -You forgot him there? It was summer. Your grandma kept looking at me and smiling. "Where's Adi?" Or Costi. I went around the house. Nobody. "I don't know." "He's in the car. Sleeping." "Why did you leave him there?" She brought him inside. I slept late the next day. That's when I said: no more drunk driving. -And you kept by it? -Nope. But never with the kids. Never with you again. God damn it! -What? -I forgot to get a vignette. We can get one up on Tihuţa. We can say we've just taken the road. That cashier distracted me with her pump. A pretty devil, as they say around here. -Want some? -No, thanks. What is this guy doing? He doesn't know either. Go on... Right. Where was I? You were alone and screw it... So, I spread the word. I'm not lame or anything, even those get married. Let's try it out. I placed ads in magazines. I'd find 10 or 12 letters each day when I got home. -You sent a photo? -No. I wrote: intellectual, engineer, healthy lifestyle, non-smoker... Me, a non-smoker! And the chicks fell for it. The single ones wanted some... Who wants to be alone? -Where's the hand wheel here? -Which one? -This one. -It got lost. Why? I wanted to tilt back my seat. You can have mine. -Wrong lane! -Never mind. You ask your father for something, he's got to come through. Now sit like that. This light pisses me off. It's neither-nor, difficult to drive. -Want me to drive? -You don't have the skill. Driving Mariţa takes effort. It's not so easy like yours, no servo. I've driven it before. This curve and two more, and we're up! So go on. I told you. I went to see about 30 women back then. I can't even remember where. Tecuci... -Gura Humorului, Dorohoi, Botoşani... -Rusu Bârgăului... Right. Where else? I even visited Amza Pellea's village, Băileşti. But there was this math teacher in laşi, Maria I think. She'd come by when I called her. So young! What ya doin'? Sleeping? -How old was she? -Seven years younger than me. We went at her parents', near Târgu Neamţ. We were all at the table, her siblings too, and when they caught a moment, like taking plates to the kitchen, they'd talk about me. I'd pretend to look away and I'd eavesdrop. What did they think? I've been through a lot. Anyway... We finish eating. Her mother or sisters had prepared some Russian salad and other stuff. Then Maria takes me for a stroll in the garden and goes: "Let's fuck in the cornfield." "Woman, I'm an old man." -The one from laşi? -Yes, Maria. -What cornfields were there? -This was at her mother's. Some village called... Colţăteşti, yes. "Let's fuck in the cornfield." Crazy woman! You wanna take her? The brakes are gone. What's wrong with it? I think I know. -We'll see. -Maybe she's tired. The hell she is. Damn hole! God damn it! Is it leaking? Where is it? -Yep, leaking. -All right. Give your father a cigarette. In the glove compartment. And a lighter. Also in the glove compartment. I'll go pour some liquid. You go under it and tighten it well when it leaks. -With what, my hand? -Take a 17 screw key. You're really something. Found it? Yes. See when it leaks and tighten the hose. Come on already! -Is it leaking? -Not yet. Wait, it's leaking! Tighten it well. You never stop talking! You drove my friends crazy. Costi, this car has two qualities: Hard to start, even harder to slow down. Got it? This is exactly how I remember you from when I was little. You like being the boss, but not actually doing stuff. Just check it. It's fine. Costi! You didn't secure the jack! -You didn't pull the hand brake! -I did! Are you kidding me? The car just moved... You actually did. -Go get it. I'm too fat to reach it. -Fuck it... It's OK, nothing happened. Fuckin' piece of... I think it was around here. I don't remember any gas station on Tihuţa Pass. -I refueled here somewhere. -Maybe it's a new one. I'm sure it's around here. Only it's not. When I saw her at the train station in Dej... She had told me the car plate number. When I saw her, boy, my jaw dropped. I think she noticed. I thought I'd go to her place. If I don't like it, I walk away. What's one more try? I knew she was a doctor. Wise guy. She is so thoughtful with me. Then she tells me her daughter's leaving for Germany. She starts crying. "My Anda will never come back!" "Serves you right, nights are for making babies." "You should have at least had 2 or 3." When my brother's daughter calls from America, he starts crying. -"Why are you crying?" -"You all have more than one child!" Meaning all his brothers. "Why did you sleep at night?" "If something happens, what do you do, hang yourself?" The daughter was leaving. Not bad, I think to myself. She had bought her mother two parrots, blue and yellow, to keep her company. Before leaving, the girl asks me: "Mr. Alexandru, if you don't mind my asking..." "Are you serious about my mother?" I guess her mother had told her I made that face, like I was disgusted. "I came again, didn't I?" She knew I was there before... "I'm too old for affairs, if that's what you're thinking." Slow down, we're in the village. I told her bluntly, "I've always had women, whenever and however I wanted. I don't need another affair. Come to my place in laşi and see the pile of letters. I've been to about 30 women by now. And I figured, maybe it was my fate to stop here." I left them both speechless. There should be a tire repair shop on the left. And then the fourth house after that. Look! Tire shop! I think it's this one here. She's stopped again, damn it. -Didn't you put in a paper? -I did. Oh, there she goes again. You get out first. -It's not here. -What do we do? Go forward, I don't know. Keep going. Fucking cold. -Didn't you say the fourth house? -They said so. Isn't that Iuli's car? -It is. -Yes. -Is it? -Yes. We're here. Come on, smoking again? Wait a bit. Who does the other car belong to? -To Adi. Whom else? -Are you sure? He's had it for a year, remember? I think it's been a year since I last saw him. I'm going in. Take my briefcase and the plum brandy from the boot. Jesus. Hello! -Where's the bathroom? -Across the stairs. How are you, dad? I was on my way to Suceava and thought I'd stop by. -Welcome! -How are you, Bubu? Come on in. -Wait, I have to take my shoes off. -No need to take your shoes off. What are you doing in Suceava? I thought I'd go see my sister, and there's this guy who used to buy stamps from me. -Got it. Come sit down. -I've been sitting. I don't have good headlights and it's nighttime... I figured I'd give you my stamps, they won't bury me with them. Just think about the themes and tell me. I have trains, traditional costumes, paintings. I'll give the ones with cartoons to Andrei. I also got you some plum brandy. Never mind the stamps, then! Get the brandy! -Look who's here, what a surprise! -Good evening! -Didn't your son tell you I'd bring him? -No. -Good evening! -Hello! -So what, it was a surprise. -How are you, mum? -That was the idea. -Grandson, how are you? My, how big you've got. Give Bubu a kiss. It was so sweet! Andrei, tell Bubu how you made a helicopter with Alina. It's a plane! A plane? Let me see it. Beautiful. Alina's his friend from here. -Really? -Look, even he has a girlfriend. Very nice! -Look, it flies. -What? Look. It flies... That's what planes do. Bubu, take your coat off. Now you broke it. -Costi... -Yes, mom? I thought that we should... Have some fun. -Any more cucumbers? -Nope. -Have some pickles. -I don't want those. -I do! -Hold your horses. -You said you didn't want them. -I do. Here, I was kidding. Bubu, some brandy? If I drink, I can't drive. -Come on... You can sleep here, right? -Of course. Man! -Cheers! -Cheers! You can do as you like, I'll give the stamps to you, but you'd better hand them down to your children or grandchildren, so they use them at their true value. If you want to sell them, at least respect my work as a collector and don't sell them for nothing. I have a stamp book here only with duplicates, that I want to sell in Suceava. I'm not giving you these, they're not valuable. I have entire collections. If you come to my place you can choose. I'll put them back. Once Maria was cooking with the door open and they got stuck to the book because of the steam. She was jealous of the stamps. Is the car inside? No, it's near the fence. Boys, I have some good countries. Either I split them between you, or you do it. I won't take the damn things to my grave. -I haven't done much for you anyway. -Don't worry about it, we'll see. No, you have to choose your countries. I have. Unless I need money, I won't sell one stamp. Me neither. Wait until he gives them to you! Life's a struggle. You have to learn things the hard way. Right, like you struggled. The best I could. We went to the seaside once, when you were little. I had a Romanian collection and I didn't want to ask your mother for money. I got the ticket from the factory, took care of the gas, but for the rest I had to ask. I sold stamps for 5000 lei on a Sunday. You all went: "Daddy, candy, chocolate!" And she wondered why I didn't ask for money. Wasn't it? You're right. She asks: "Don't you want any money?" We'd go have a drink, a beer on the beach... "Where do you have the money from?" "I sold some stamps." She was surprised. "You can sell them?" "Of course, I got money for them." But that was the only time you sold stamps. I only saw you buy them. This carrot salad is very good. It's the olive oil in the dressing. -That's what it was? -What? I thought it tasted funny. It's healthier. That's how my doctress makes them too. I've really missed this Moldavian food. Transylvanians can't cook. Only soups and more soups. -No borscht whatsoever. -Want some beet borsch? Thanks, I'm too fat as it is. Ana drives me crazy with her soups, too. Why didn't Ana come? She went to her folks. In my house, nobody eats soup. I've got a Moldavian wife, as far as I can remember. -Want half? -I'll just take a smaller one. Give it to me, Iuli. The smaller half. -Fish, fish, asking for some polenta. -Good idea. I wanted to make some, but... A peasant goes to a fancy restaurant, and there's a gentleman next to him. -Adi, pass the garlic sauce. -Here you go. Even better with garlic sauce. I add a bit of ground walnut to it. -Now you're a cook! -With walnut? -What a cook! -Yes, it's less hot. Go on. The city boy orders fish, the peasant, bovine meat. -Bovine meat! -Yes, beef... After he's done eating, the city boy says to the waiter: "Waiter, the fish wants to go for a swim." The peasant makes no sense of it, but sees the waiter coming with a big jug of wine. So then the peasant says: "Waiter, the bovine is thirsty!" I remember once, it was winter, we drove to the countryside, to Budeni. We received a call that Iuli was crying. -He was always crying. -True. I wanted to spend time with you, but you wanted to go to the kid. -What are you doing? -Lying down. Go to bed upstairs. And off we went. It was snowing like hell. Before long, he says: "Let's go back, think of the child." Yes. Adi was with us. It was Costi, Adi wasn't even born yet. Costi, Adi, same thing. And I go: "Is that all the guts you have?" She was measuring my guts... What if we'd been left snowbound? Then we hit a snow bank and couldn't get the car out. What to do? "Let's try to push it." The little one starts playing driver. Honking, flashing the headlights. I push from the front, by the wheel, and Sandu gets it started. When he revs it up, it throws all that cold snow up my skirt. -You wanted guts! -I was soaked. We got out of there eventually, but by the time we got to Budeni, Iuli was sleeping like a log. I hung my skirt out to dry and we laid down beside him. Thanks for the meal. Hope you enjoyed it! What shall we drink, Bubu? -How about some wine! -Red? If you have any... Of course. I want some too. Want some, mum? Not red. I’ve had some white. -You, love? -Just a bit. Enough. -Cheers, to our health! -Cheers! Can you pass the fish? More fish? I didn’t get the bovine joke. You’re kidding me. -No, I mean it. -What didn’t you get? One orders fish and then says the fish wants to swim. The beef guy says the bovine is thirsty. -Yes. -But what, the bovine is thirsty... What was he to say? "The bovine wants to go for a swim?" He understood how he could order a drink. He made the connection. The fish swims, the bovine drinks. But the fish wasn’t swimming in the belly. Was it? It was a lady fish! What do you mean it was a lady fish? Now he’s messing with me! No, I’m serious. Shut up. I’m serious. Stop laughing! So he ate fish and said the fish wants to swim. But the fish is dead, it can't swim. -I’m going somewhere with this. -Let him say it. Fish is dead, it can't swim. So it’s a theoretical thing. -A metaphor. -If I feel like laughing, I laugh! -So it's a metaphor. -Don't laugh so loud. -A what? -A metaphor. -And the bovine in the belly? -Also a metaphor. But with no practical basis. Is the kid sleeping? Instead of looking at my crazy, shock-headed self. -I should get a cap. -Or a handkerchief. What handkerchief? You wore one, knotted at four corners, when you got out of the shower. Maria, the boys are laughing at their own father. -You know what would work now? -Some sable fur! Attached to the ass! That's not bad either, but some plum brandy would be better. Yes! Where's the bag? -Whose bottle are we drinking from? -Who cares, let's find it first! By the door! We'll drink from mine, I'm the oldest. -Corina! -Yes? Can I get three brandy glasses? -Make it four, Corina! -Four, the man is up. It's good to have a daughter-in-law. I'm sitting here with my boys, having a drink. Isn't that convenient! The prince is up! As if anyone could sleep here. Let's see if it's any good, after all that praising. -Coming right up. -Let's see. -You want some? -No, thank you. I have my tea. I'll be off to bed in a minute. Here you go. -Let's see if you like my plum brandy. -And another glass. -Thanks! -Here you go. -Cheers! -Cheers! -Tasty, but a bit strong. -Strongly tasty! It tastes good strong. It's distilled twice, right? Yes, in Dej they only make it like this. But this is my first year, next year I'm making wine too. I'll give you a demijohn each if you come by. Yes, please do, Bubu. Have some "skirt up" pie. -I made it. -You did? Let's see. Want some? Marvelous, Corina! A woman near Dej once told me Moldavian girls wear their skirts up. You know what I said? That girls in Transylvania pull them up completely. -Keeping your Moldavian pride intact. -Of course! All the Moldavians there sound like Transylvanians. Why is that? -Goes well with plum brandy! -Yes, nice and tender. When I got my first paycheck, I had such a craving for chocolate that I bought about 18. And after I ate it all I was horny as hell. -You were what? -Horny! -He got horny! -Twice! I went to Fălticeni. I knew a girl, Anica, who fucked bakers. -How'd you know? -What? How did you know she fucked bakers? She always had flour on the back of her uniform. And? -I forgot where I left off. -Flour on her uniform. -Yes. -Yes... So I suggest this and that to Anica and she says: -"Will you buy me a glass of cognac?" -"Of course." At the pub she tells me she's also hungry. I got chicken livers for both of us, they were cheaper. We got our bellies full. But I notice I don't have enough money because I'd also bought two suits and chocolate. What the hell am I gonna do? There was a guy with lottery tickets. I had nothing to lose. And I won. All was well. I could afford the ticket home, I got another round of cognac... -You got Anica too! -Damn right I did! You were a teacher in Siliştea then, right? Yes, in Siliştea. Costi, one more glass from my bottle? What about you, Bubu? -Sure. -Pass me your glass, I'll pour some. Wait, it's too strong. Better some wine. ♪ Magdalena ♪ ♪ I can see by your shoes you're not one I'd want to lose ♪ It doesn't go that way, Adi. No, it's not like that! ♪ Magdalena, there's no rest, I wanna know who grabbed your chest ♪ -I didn't know that one! -There you go. See? You leave from your folks with the dick still wet. ♪ Give me my glass, I want to celebrate ♪ How's your blood pressure? Red wine gets it up. It gets it up! White, switch to white. Treci pe alb. She was so beautiful. I'd have never left. Perfection is in one's conscience, as the philosopher says. Never mind philosophy, let's have a drink. Cheers. Boys, I've only loved once in my life. And here, in Galaţi. Once, when I was in highschool. Iuli knows. I have a photo. -Why does he know and we don't? -He's the oldest. You'll find out in a minute. I went to this dance. It was the 1st of May, Labor Day, the 2nd of May was Youth Day. A sort of disco. Nice dance. -Beautiful girl. -Beautiful indeed. One of those singers from the band at the dance, a handsome man, older than us, around 40. He noticed how beautiful my girl was. He came to me. I didn't say my brother was the big boss there. And a friend of mine, mean motherfucker, a bully, sturdy and all... Who? A mate, boy! Beautiful indeed! Continue the story about Angelica! A Gipsy woman, hot as fire. I'd have loved to feel her up! -Except she didn't want to. -She did, but no. But that meant mother, father, wedding. I loved her, she was pretty, but... Everyone in our class could tell she was passionate. She was a classmate? She was in my class. I was secretly in love with her. What's the word? Not melancholically... Angelica. Some name! The angel... The angel of love, Adi! Or something. I asked this neighbour of mine: "I wonder how Angelica's doing?" "She's poor, you know." "I'd go see her." And did you? -In Budeni, right? -No... No, I wasn't with your mother then. I was divorced. No, you were with mum! I wasn't. All this was after the divorce. -I'll tell you... -Not then. I meant... Anişoara. Anişoara who? -The one who fucked bakers. -That was Anica! Same difference. You were with mum, you said you were teaching in Siliştea. -Yes, I was already born. -Yes. If you say so. It's not that I say so, it's true. I bring you here and you tell us about fucking other women while married to mom. What's gotten into you? It's different. OK, I admit it, "sorin obrej". I was married to your mother, but I was young! What do you mean, "sorin obrej"? It's from poker. -What? -"Oblij" or something. It's "noblesse oblige", meaning "nobility obliges". -That's it. -"Sorin obrej"! I got the meaning right. All of it! Listen here, boys... Well, I was charming. Not quite Prince Charming though. I am, as they say... You are, but not quite. Hey boy, if I swing one at you... Do you see this paw? Calm down! It's OK, Bubu, let me pour you another one. Good boy, pour your father a drink. My eyes are dripping down. -Cheers! -Yes. -What's done is done. -That's right. And what will be will be as long as it's gonna be. Right. Give your father a cigarette. Here's the lighter. I want fire from the heart, Adi. Take this and then we'll see. Me too. Boys, I loved life and that's that. God damn it, I loved it. Yeah. -I'm kind of wasted. -Kind of, yeah. Once, I was drunk, coming from Dolhasca to laşi. Maybe not... -Never mind, just say it. -I can't remember. Yes... and... -Your mum saw my eyes twinkling. -High beam headlights? -Good morning! -Good morning! Excuse me! I've brought the milk. Tell the lady she doesn't have to hurry with the checkout. Okay. -Good morning! -Good morning! You slept well? I slept. Hey, little grandson, no good morning from you? Come to Bubu! Hey, little piglet! I really have to watch cartoons. It's compulsory. If it's compulsory... Then watch... -Morning. -Good morning! Occupied! Good morning! Andrei, what do you want to eat? Milk and cereals, please. -Hey, how are you? -I'm fine. -Have you eaten? -No, it will be ready soon. -Is the bathroom free? -Yes. -Mother? -Yes. -Where's my backpack? -By the table. -Where did you put your new gloves? -I forgot. Gather your Legos or I leave them here. I'm eating and watching TV. I can't gather them while I eat. Really now! I see you have no problem talking. Eat, then go gather them. I won't say a thing. What's the formation? I'm with mum, we have shopping to do, and you're going with him. Wanna drive? -What's wrong with you? -You slept more. I'm beat. OK. Just let me drink this coffee. My head is bursting from that wine. It's not the wine. It's you mixing drinks. I'm fine! What about you, Bubu? Me? I'm fine. I told you to stick with the wine. Instead of listening to your father... What about you? What? What "what"? Repeat what Costi said. Come on. You understood. -What about me. -See? It's so annoying. I do the same thing. I say "what" even though I understood. That is, how do you say... You said it earlier too! -Our mold. -What's that? Another one! I really didn't get it. -Mold! -But what does it mean? How should I put it? Acting like the preceding. Man! That was some explanation! He's close. An inherited trait. It's our nature. My smart boys! So what are you gonna do? I was just thinking about that. I thought you were staying for a few days. I'm coming with you to Suceava. I want to see my sister, haven't seen her in a while. Maybe I can get rid of those stamps and leave you some money. I told Costi he caught me with my pants down. Penniless. Don't worry. You'd better go to Dej. Melania will be upset. -Aren't you driving? -Costi is. That thing's full of germs. Didn't I tell you beer's no drink for men? Yeah, I know. The best drink for men is... -Wine, I know. -No. Wine is the best drink for women, if men drink it. Want some beer? Definitely now. Bubu! Can you please get me an apple from that tree? Sure, Bubu will get one in a second. Get some for us too! I will! For you too, they're good for hangovers. I did. Bubu, you'll visit us again, right? The hell he will. If I hadn't picked him up... Andrei, come to Bubu! Come on, Andrei! You asked me to get you apples. -Give Bubu a kiss! -Thank you. This one is not hurt. You should wash it first. Now you want to eat it? -Tastes good! -It is? I'll make you a compote. Only with the rotten ones. They're not rotten, only bruised. Mother, what are you doing? I'm going to Dej after all. How come? The club called. I'd forgotten I have a Christmas exhibition. Safe trip! Bye, have a safe trip. Morning. How are you? Did you get my message last night? And why didn't you answer? Did you take the two o'clock train? Cool! And you stopped by Mamone's? Cool! When did you get to Braşov? Decent. So, shall I come to you or are you coming to me? I'd rather come. Suit yourself. But how? No, not that shitty train. You have a bus at two. Take that one. It's 12 now. You have time, right? Yes. OK. You'll be in Suceava by eight, right? OK. Never mind the car. Adi's lending us his. -Can we borrow your car? -Why didn't you bring yours? He is. OK, call me on the way to let me know if there's a delay. How would you know? You simply look at the time. Or ask the driver, just don't make me wait for you in the bus station. All right. I talked about spending the New Year's Eve on Tihuţa. Yes. With Silviu and Andreea. Yes. Yes, just for the holidays. They're going back afterwards. OK, bye. Subtitle translation by Anca Barbulescu
