Leader of the opposition on five. Hello? Get that to James. ...the Princess of Wales who is expecting a baby... Between 50 and 60 scrap metal workers are reported to have-- Newsroom. Yeah, Paul Dean. Dean. Went to IRN. Went to IRN, try there, yeah. Okay, bye. Reported to have landed illegally on the island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic, stop. The foreign office reacted skeptically to reports that the Argentine government was planning-- How's Mary? Hm? Oh, she's well. Jolly well, thanks. Very well indeed. One minute. Now, before the news at 12 o'clock, there's just time to tell you about Women's Hourthis afternoon. Commander Freddie Bracknell will be talking about his four years as a German prisoner of war in Stalag III. The mountaineer, John Clayton, will be reliving the thrills and perils of Mount Everest. And Polly Morel will be finding out from the historian professor, John Gurty, how the governments of Eastern Europe distort their recent past in history books to suit their present policies and allegiances. That's Freddie Bracknell, John Clayton, and John Gurty, all on Women's Hour at just after two o'clock this afternoon. BBC news at 12 o'clock. There is cautious optimism in Brussels. ...it's going to get thicker as the evening goes by. And there's [indistinct]that's the price that we pay for having high pressure over the country at this time of the year, this time pressure... - And meanwhile, in the north, it's rather topsy turvy. Come on, you promised. Well, tell her you've got a piece to finish or something. Oh, you can do it. She is gonna be there. I told you last week, but Jeremy, come on, concentrate. Listen, all I want you to do is introduce me to her. That's all. And, uh, just give me a big buildup. So I took him by the elbow, steered him into a corner of the room and said, "Where do you think you are, young man? Faber's?" Ah, glad you could come. James Penfield. Good, good. Is anyone getting you a drink? He wrote the Berlin Airlift chapter. I know, I know. Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War , James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter on the Berlin Airlift, one of the best chapters in the book. James, basically this is our UK sales team. Now, what was I saying? My dear James. Not here. To the airlift. ...reads books during a recession. Any sign of the goddess, Barrington? Not yet. ...truth is that none of them will get off their backside and sell books. Is there anybody here you know? One or two. Great lot. Some Social Democrats, some diligent anticommunists. A man from the political section of the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine courtesy of the CIA. By the way, I hear your Mr. Gold is about to become very rich. I hope you've told him that most of the ideas for the chapter on the Berlin Airlift came from me. Fuck off. So it all worked out perfectly. - That's her. - She keeps the house. He got the car and the baby's still with the au pair! Jeremy! - Jeremy, how fantastic. Susan, darling. You're so famous now. And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here? Well, we're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. 12 programs, lots of stock film. Oh, well in that case, you must meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift. - Hi. - Hi. Was that your chapter then? It was very good. Thanks. Actually, you know, we have already met at the Vidor film last week. Oh, oh yes. You won't remember, we didn't actually speak. Oh, oh look, I'm being terribly rude. This is Bob, Bob Tuckett. Bob was at Oxford too. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Excuse me. Oh. - Thanks. - Charles! In many ways, I'm right behind the women's movement. Sometimes I wish they'd just get on with it and stop moaning on. The office was split right down the middle. I mean, as a woman, I could understand what they were saying. That current affairs is all about what men did. But as a human being, and a television researcher, as a professional, I could just sense they've got it all wrong. I could see there were two paths I could go down. Power or not power. And down the not power path was lots of sisterly feeling, masochism, and frustration. And down the other path, I could keep on working. So of course I voted with the men and the other women all resigned. I think they're mad, don't you? Can I give you a lift? No, it's all right, I can-- I can get a cab. Night-night. You said this word, finally. We've heard this before. Difficult when it gets cl-- when it gets close to finally the main points of the news. Hm? Now today. Not a very sexy list. We can't leave off all these court cases. Royals, what's Charles giving Diana for her birthday? He's not telling. You'd better follow him around then. Newcastle are following Charles to see if anybody throws a bottle at his car like last time. Good. I want to drop this panda business, unless something happens soon. We've got two people down at the zoo, looking into the cage. Give it one more day. These scrap merchants from, uh, where is it? Grytviken? Anything in there? Oh, it could be. Keep an eye on it. Okay. I'm just thinking aloud. Well, we'll go through the whole list in order. Cabinet reshuffle, Chris? Bob's ringing the Minister. He's finding out where they're all going to be. John's gonna be at Caxton Hall. We'll try and lay on a radio count. Prime Minister's appearing on the Jimmy Young show at 10:30 this morning. Should get something out of that. Now, matters Irish. It's expected that Mr. Hague will be questioned by the about Washington reports that American military cooperation with Britain, although officials insisted that these reports... Hello, sir. Morning to you. Morning to you, sir. I'll take your coats. This way. I was only 10 years old at the time. But it's the first international crisis I can remember. It's obviously a key point in our recent history. Well, the key point. And I've always thought that sooner or later we would have to re-examine Suez in the light of subsequent events. And now, suddenly with all this Falklands business upon us, it's become clear that we do need to take another look at '56. Now the way I see the book is that it would get away completely-- Would you like a dessert? I'm having one. Uh, no, thanks. Just coffee, please. I--I think I'll have, uh, some of that. Yes. I'd like the book to get away completely-- I think I'll have--no, no. And two coffees. I'm sorry. I--I--I would just want you to get away completely from all the moralizing and the talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez. Oh, you are not a Socialist, then. No. Oh, good. I'd want to set out the events as they happened. The way I see it is this. The British empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of the century, but it wasn't totally dishonorable to try and defend its remains, and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives are trying to do. And then-- Would you like a Sambuca? Yes, please. Hm, two Sambucas. Yes, there's the, uh, the essential business of the British collusion with Israel. Of course it's proved beyond all doubt now. But I'd want to set it in the context of diplomacy and warfare. If you're about to attack one country, it makes sense to encourage its neighboring countries to attack it too. The French understood this. They could never make out all the embarrassment and breast beating of the British. My enemies enemy is my friend. It's as simple as that. See, if we'd not been so scrupulous, we'd need not have been so ashamed. Now, it's as if we've discovered ourselves again. We're acting independently. When the standard line has always been that since Suez, we couldn't lift a finger without the Americans. Your readership will be mainly first and second year American college students. The freshmen and sophomores. Ah, you have the lingo. Jolly good! Because that means you'll have to keep it simple. Not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple. And always remember that it's an American readership. Like I was saying, I think the American angle on the Suez is very important. I don't want to say they let us down. I think that's wrong. A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes. Who tells you when to pull back. The Americans were good allies. It's as simple as that. Just a moment. Susie Barrington. Hello, Jimmy. Dad. I'm just making your mother's tea. Come in the kitchen. So how is she? Oh, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. Keeps on asking when you're coming. And I'm sorry about Saturday. I couldn't get away. Oh, she knows you're very busy. Especially now with everything going on. The doctor says to try her on solids. But she's been right off her food. Here, take this up to her. Tell her you made it. She'll like that. Yeah. Jimmy. Mum. I knew you'd come today. I said to Dad this morning, that boy of ours will be here this afternoon. Just you see. He said, "Don't get your hopes up," but...I knew. Do you have to go straight away? No. No, not yet. Oh, good. Stay a little while. She's asleep. Well, everyone's been marvelous. Really, Jimmy. The neighbors come in and sit with her while I'm at the shop. That's good. And Joe Ramage, you remember him? Well, he comes along and helps me out. Oh yes, yes, I think you told me. You like a cup of tea? Oh, no thanks, Dad. Well, have some beer. I've got some here. No, no, that's fine. Gee, I really think I should be going. I've got a meeting tonight. Well, the bed's all made up if you want to stay. Um... I'll call you in a couple days, shall I? Yeah. What did you think of the Vidor film? - Quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else was. I thought it was terrific. I thought it went on rather too long. I didn't want it to end. I didn't like that man. Oh, I thought he was wonderful. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This afternoon's performance at the Barbican Hall will begin in 10 minutes. Please take your seats. And the shape of it all. It was sort of shapeless. Well didn't, you know, the long flashbacks, didn't you think they worked really well? I know what you mean, but I don't like flashbacks. They make me feel as if I'm holding my breath. I like progress. You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian. Good theory. But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does. Too bad. What does your father do? My real father? Uh huh. Well, he was a flashback. You're a clerk in a rather dowdy office. You're pleased with the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts. Knowing how to judge length, ending a broadcast on the dot. Having everything run as smoothly as possible. Selecting a running order that makes sense. Knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do. It's professionalism. And you're at this third stage? No, no, there's a fourth, numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way. I think you're exaggerating. Oh? If you aren't, you should jolly well change your job. Ah, yes. Yes. You're much too old to be making a drama out of alienation or whatever you want to call it. You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness. That's what I think, anyway. It's the poet laureate himself. How sweet! Thank you, thank you. You too been smoking that illegal stuff again? We were just admiring your poem in the TLS , Edward. Ah, yes. It's terribly good. Don't tell me you actually read it, Jeremy. Oh, committed it to memory forever. - See? - Blasé and epicene. We--we were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene. It perfectly describes the new foreign secretary. I hope you don't mind, Edward. I've borrowed it for my piece today. Attributed? Of course. Why is there a new foreign secretary? Who was the old one, anyway? Needn't concern you, Edward. James has got news. He needs a poet's advice. I don't want any jokes about this. James is in love. Congratulations. Who with? A glamorous young lady way above his station. Bastard. Name of Susie Barrington. Daughter of eminent historian, Ann Barrington. - Stepdaughter of scandalous... - More like lovers, really, Mummy and I. Or sisters. And then a couple of years after Daddy died, not long after I'd left Oxford, she started seeing various men. I was furious. Then I started seeing what was a different man and.. I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand. So I wrote her a long letter. It was seven pages saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried we were drifting apart. You know... she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters. How nice. Makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again. And then she got married to Matthew, who's a womanizer and a bit of a yob. Quite nice, really. Makes TV commercials. What about yours? Both dead. Must be quite nice in a way, really. - - I mean, you don't have any... Damn. They're early. Who? I called you a taxi. That's very thoughtful. Well, you know. Again? Yes, if you like. Call me at work. To the fleet. What fleet? In the Algiers. Algiers. ...the black ship of the Royal Navy... And now, top secret file. What have you got? Let me look. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Tell me what you think of this first. Shit. You approve. Let me see. Get away. You'll see it when I'm ready. First, I want you to reflect on my noble behavior and how your interests are closest to my heart. I lay awake at night worrying-- Jeremy, just let me see what you've got, would you? You're so hard. All right, then. I was chatting with some people on the diary page, and the name Barrington came up. I expressed an interest. Oh, yes. An innocent interest. I found out that last yearVogue ran a series called "Mothers and Daughters." Number seven, Ann and Susan Barrington. Being a decent and loving friend, I went to the files and made a copy. - Let me see it. - Ah, ah, there's more. The piece celebrates the undying affection that exists between the eminent left-wing historian and her dazzling daughter. Well, then the newsroom editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he was working on the Guardian , Ann Barrington wrote a very good piece on... What? No, you have to guess. Jeremy, please, don't piss about. Just show it to me, will you? Suez. It's 1966, the 10th anniversary. She hasn't written a book on it. She clearly knew a lot. Mm. It's obvious what you've got to do. The way into the daughter's pants is through the mother. Up the Suez Canal. You're so gross. She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk, very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there. Ha, ha. According to the piece, the daughter visits often. You'll have to get yourself invited for the right weekend. You've really got it all worked out, haven't you? Well, you don't need to thank me, if you don't want to. You can just pay for these drinks. That'll be 11 pounds, sir. I was wondering if it would be possible to talk to you. Well, I've read your book. I really admired it. That's very kind of you. Lecture room two. I'll look forward to it. Yeah, thanks, bye. Room two, do you know it? Lecture room two? Thank you. The withdrawal of the British from Palestine and the erosion of their influence in the area... ...in the Middle East in the immediate post-war years. And so a vacuum had been created. If United States did not fill it, it was assumed that the Soviet Union would. Now next week, I should be considering the extent to which the behavior of nation states or governments can be judged by any moral criteria that we would normally apply to individuals. Thank you. Okay? Right. All right, well, what you really need to remember first off is that all through the late-- I'm sorry, you're going to have to lean forward and speak into this, if that's possible. Oh, sorry. All right, how's that? That better? - That'll be fine, right. - Better then, right. What you need to remember is that all through the late summer, the early autumn of 1956, the Egyptians were running the canal, and that's their canal by the way, quite efficiently. Ships from all over the world were all passing through quite smoothly because, you see, Nasser didn't want to give the West any reason for invading his country. Sorry, is that--is that loud enough, by the way? It's okay. Right. So by the time the French and the British got round to launching their invasion in...early in November, the important economic reasons for doing so had just, well, they largely evaporated. The canal was running smoothly and all that remained, especially for the British, were the much more marginal and the emotional arguments. You see, if you use the language of personal behavior, you could actually say that this was an affair of the heart. The whole idea was to teach Nasser a lesson that he wouldn't forget. And to appear to be acting independently, and to maintain face in the world, and particularly in the Arab world. And so the ferry moves across the bay, top heavy as a wedged wedding cake, leaving us to return to our hotels. Gulls in nautical trim cry their farewells, then drop with avaricious eyes to take souvenirs from the debris of the day. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes? - Me? - Yes. Oh, oh, yes. Well, I--I thought perhaps I'd get the thing started by asking, you know, you'll probably think it's a stupid question that you get all the time, but I wondered if you'd tell us a little how you actually get an idea. I mean, your poems are quite extraordinary and beautiful, and I--I wondered, well, you know, how they came about? Well, it isn't a stupid question, but it is quite a difficult one to answer. Um, I suppose ideas come to me in much the same way as they come to anybody. Uh, perhaps the difference is that I take them more seriously. Um, I write them down. - Odd scraps of things. - And then I seem to know if work has to be done on the poem, and it sort of takes shape as I write it, rather slowly. Thank you. Yes. Uh, you're the one of the most praised poets of your generation of younger poets. And the Sunday Times just called you a cross between Dante and Philip Larkin. What's your reaction to this? Well, it's silly, really. It's journalism. Yes. Uh yes, um, what is the poet's role in society today? Sorry. [woman over PA]Edward on four. Confirmed here that the United States... And with talks-- James, take a look at this. - Wait. - At last. At the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties at Westminster, stop. Take a look at that. - Speaking on the Jimmy Young show earlier today. It's not bad. 15 news items. I got exactly the same running order as the Bulletin desk. Terrific. They're all old pros, guy. 15 news items. Uh, Mrs. Thatcher said that the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging. Hey, can I use the phone in your office? Yeah, sure. - Would only bring the rate down to-- Hermes and Invincible came in from different directions in a classic figure of eight attack on the airfield at Stanley. You're being very elusive. Well, tell them you're ill. Well leave early then. Do it properly, tell him a lie. Okay, well just come when you can. You got the address? Yes, it'll be nice. Why don't you stay? I have to be up early. So do I. Two or three years ago, I would have stayed and fucked you. Just my luck, too late. Now I'm more wary. Must be getting old. You don't trust me? I don't trust anyone. It's what comes from working in television. You know, in radio, we're different. I bet. Thanks for the meal. And will I see you in Norfolk over the weekend? You just might. That's enough of that. We've been playing for 10 minutes, for Christ sake. That's far too long. - Here you go. - Thanks. What you been up to? Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland angle. Purdy's come up with a real dog. Workers' rights in Argentina. I've been running around trying to get people to do things, but no one's very keen. Workers' rights. Since when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers' rights? I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscopes, sport, celebs, gossip, the occasional firm stand on the--" The torture of small children. On the torture of very small children. But I start telling them about their rights-- Hermes rights. You know, we're even phrasing in a couple of exiled RG trade unionists from Paris for a...a TV tie-in. One of them had his balls danced on by the secret police. The other had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police had introduced them-- Come on, out. Yes, my good man. I'm sorry, this is a private conversation. You'll have to wait, outside. You can't smoke in here. This is a squash court. But we booked it for a smoke. Didn't we James? I'm afraid we haven't quite finished. Come on, out. Look, the court is ours for another half an hour. Run along. I said out. On the other hand, a quiet drink in the bar might be slightly more comfortable. Hey, I've got some news on Suez. I suppose a serious drink might be of some use. Excuse me, sorry. Thanks. Hello? Oh, hello, Dad. Look, I've been meaning to call you. I-- How is she? Oh, God. What, in the middle of the night? What did the doctor say? Yes, I will. I will, I promise. It's just that I've been rather busy with the crisis on and I've been working day and night. Look, tell her I'll come as soon as I can. I promise. Yeah, okay. Give her my love. Bye. Because you see, if you can speak of a nation like an individual acting emotionally, you can also speak of it acting deceitfully. Britain and France had entered into a secret agreement with the Arabs' deadly enemies, the Israelis. The Israelis were to attack Egypt on an agreed date. British planes based in Cyprus were to precision bomb Egyptian air fields to protect Israeli cities from any kind of retaliation. The British and the French would invade on the pretext of separating the combatants. And that became a catchphrase of the day, by the way. Separating the combatants. Right. Hello. I'm just waiting for your mother. She said, "Awfully sorry. Make yourself comfortable." She won't be long. Thanks. Want to sit down and wait? All right, thank you, I will. She's not my mother anyway. My mother's in Italy. Oh, really? Have you come to talk about me? No, we'll talk history. What period? 1956, Suez. Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens? Yes, all right. It goes from Henry the Eighth. Henry the Eighth, Edward the Sixth, Mary, Elizabeth the First, James the First, Charles the First. Charles the Second, James the Second, William and Mary, Ann, George the First, Second, Third and Fourth, William the Fourth, Victoria, Edward the Seventh, George the Fifth, Edward the Eighth, George the Sixth, Elizabeth the Second. You missed out the Cromwells. They don't count. Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you. That's quite all right. It's very good of you to see me. Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden. And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee in the study? Okay. And remember to say please. - - Hello. - He's a little unhappy. - Betty. - I hope he wasn't a nuisance. - I want some coffee... - He was delightful. - ...in the study. Please. Shall we go through? Yes, yes. You had no difficulty finding your way then? No, your directions were very clear. Many times people miss that turn in. My first husband worked for the BBC. I doubt if anyone there remembers him now. Another long-dead diligent administrator. Thank you, Betty. He would have been useful to them now, you know. He was involved in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis. One of the few things he was passionate about. Thanks, no black is fine, thank you. I became involved too. I started work on a book that would have been published on the 10th anniversary of Suez. But then he died and I lost the will to write it. By the time I was over his death, other books had been published and it wasn't worth going on. What a shame. Oh, it wasn't much more than a potboiler. Suez was very important to our generation and I didn't want it forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really, Mr. Penfield, I was looking through my notes before you came. They're all very much out of date. There's been so much written since. I don't think I'm your man. I am a great admirer of yours. I read all your books on charters while I was still at school. See, I'm a journalist, not a historian. And they're questions of, well, approach, method. I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield? Yes. Well, good. Suez was a mine field for both parties. - Tom! Come on, my love. See ya, Ben. My husband apologizes for not joining us. He has to take Tom into town. Ah. Won't you sit down? Thanks. Oh, it's not too cold for you, is it Mr. Penfield? No, it's fine, thanks. Thank you. Since you're a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think? Yes, please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was. Thanks. And I'd like you to call me Ann. To Ann. To James. See you later. Bye! Goodbye. Hm, I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer, Kundera, has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting. Have some pâté. History books are the first onto the bonfires? No. If we leave the remembering to the historians, the struggle's already lost. Everyone must have a memory. Everyone needs to be a historian. In this country, for example, we are in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off into a perpetual present. Here I am lecturing you. Help yourself. So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur. I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty. If you like. But don't be too modest, James. It's a citizen's duty to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You are a responsible journalist, doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day, you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you. You're kind to be so encouraging. I think you'll do very well. I've met some of her colleagues, and I must say they struck me as rather empty people. Very ambitious and charming, too, but not serious. No politics. I do worry about Susan. Have you known her long? She hasn't mentioned you. Well, actually we've only just met, but we're quite good friends. Pity she couldn't make it up here today. Yes. She'll be here next week though. Why don't you come too? I'll show you the marshes properly. And if you're lucky, you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia. Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance. Oh, don't be silly. I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome. As you can see, we're not entirely short of room. Well, thank you very much. You've been very helpful. See you next weekend, then. - - Oh! I wish you wouldn't drive so fast, Matthew! I'll get a bike, I promise. All right, just off? Matthew, my husband. James Penfield. - Hello. - Hi. James is coming to stay next weekend. Oh, very good, yes. I'll see you then. Come on, Tom. Let's see if we can get this thing working. Bye. At the same time, that's behaving aggressively. And this pursuit of--of virtue, led to a great many lies... Getting back to what I was saying before... ...individuals behave like governments... Are you the man from the BBC? What? Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you, but you must be from the BBC. I've been looking out for you. You don't exactly look like a farmer. I'm Betty. Oh hello, I'm James Penfield. Come on and meet the others. They've been waiting for you. I found a man from the BBC, but he's not the man. Oh, never mind. We'll just have to make do. - Hello. - Would you like a cup of tea? Well, I-- Jill, get the young man a cup. Sit yourself down on that log. - Uh, listen, I-- - Be careful, wobbles. I've got a puncture. I was wondering if I could borrow a jack. - Oh. - Pete, Pete! Pete, Pete! Sit yourself down. Here. Do you want sugar? No that's fine. Pete, have we got a jack? Would you look it up for our friend here? I'm sorry to be a nuisance. Now first of all, tell us your name. Uh, Penfield, James Penfield. James. This is Carol. - Hi ya. - Jill. - Hello. - Betty, Mandy... - Hello, Louise. - Louise. That's Pete over there, and I'm Carmen. Hi. There's another 15 of us out at a meeting. We'd like to show you around the camp. Oh, let him finish his tea first, poor thing. I don't know what's happened to that other man. He said he'd be here at three o'clock. We lost... What do you do at the BBC, James? I work for radio news in London. Oh, well that's marvelous. But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent. Oh, well that doesn't matter. I mean, long as we get our message through to someone out there. Jill, where are those handouts? Oh, they're back here somewhere. Oh, great. Thanks. It's a bit crumpled, here. Um, I just-- Yeah. This tells you how the women's peace camp came to be set up. All local women at first. Later we had support from women and men from all over the country. - Very good. - The response has been amazing. Good, good. Ah, and this is about the base itself. How many missiles there are. What they're going to be used for and so on. We have the local radio down here. Oh, that's terrific. No, but what we really need is national coverage. It's been difficult with the Falklands madness going on. Yes, I'm sure. Do you think you'll be able to do something when you get there? Well, um, I'll certainly try. Only problem is, you see, that I'm news and not features. Might help if you were attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back in a moment, thanks. Ordinary people everywhere are saying, "No, we don't want these terrible weapons." That's news! Yeah. - - I won't be a moment, thanks. Off then? Oh, yes, uh, I've just left the jack by the, uh, the hut there and... Anyway, thanks for your help. It's a... I must be getting back, so, um... Anyway, thanks again. All the best. Have you got a pass? - Sorry? - Have you got a pass? Oy. - Rachel Neal. It's Rachel Neal. Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained. Sorry, I got held up. What are you doing here? Delivering gossip and good will. It seems we're both going to do Brighton this year. Perhaps you should come too. Will it be fun? It was last year. We'll see if we can dig up some Suez survivors for you. Well, perhaps I will. I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me all about Norfolk. I'll call you. Okay, we're ready now. So how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother? I think she liked me. Did she talk about me? No. We talked about history and Siberian geese. Egypt's President Nasser has made his grant. He calls it nationalization. It's not in chronological order. There's an hour of stuff, of which the director has to choose four minutes. What'll happen is that I'll choose it for him. In the debate in the House on Suez, the Prime Minister said, "I truly think that we have done everything in our power to show our good will. Colonel Nasser's arbitrary action, and reach of Egypt's solemn undertakings reveals the nature of the regime with which we have to deal." It was in the House of Commons that the government's decision was announced, following Israel's advance into Egypt. Sir Anthony said-- Now does he look like a man on speed? ...have called upon Egypt and Israel to stop all war-like action forthwith, and to withdraw their military forces to a distance of 10 miles from the canal. He also indicated possible action to separate the belligerents and to guarantee freedom of transit through the canal. First, the scene at a port in Cyprus, with accent on the French preparations for seaborne landings in Egypt. Always in readiness for Anglo-French action to restore order in the Middle East. Already, highly successful attacks on Egyptian airfields had been carried out, and now these ships and troops awaited orders to follow up the airborne landings, in the general plan to separate the combatants and secure the freedom of the canal to a width of 10 miles on either side. It's up to everyone here in Britain to do everything in our power to back up all our forces who are so coolly and efficiently carrying out their duties. The damage caused by that airborne assault on the morning of November the fifth was localized. But a few blocks suffered badly in the first hours. ...the canal and to restore law and order in the Middle East. Why don't they make propaganda films like that anymore? [man over intercom]Is that all? Yes, thanks. Do you think Mum has invited you back for her sake or for mine? I haven't really given it much thought. Well, you should. Let's get on. Yeah. Charles, I didn't know you were back. Did you have a good holiday? Not too bad, thanks. How have you been? I've been working hard on that book I was telling you about. Are you coming to the meeting? I don't think I can face it. Come on, you can keep me company. How's Mary? She's fine. Well, actually-- - Excuse me. - All right, sorry. We're broken up. It's all over. Charles, that's terrible. What happened? Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't hack it. Really gets at them, and they won't admit it, these types. They said we put both sides. Theirs and the government's, multilateralists and unilateralists, hawks and doves. As far as they're concerned, there's only one side to the question. Nuclear weapons are bad, full stop, end of discussion. And anyone thinks there's more to it than that, they're, what is it? They're...under cover of an authoritative new service propagating a military definition of reality. Still, with the party conferences coming up, there's bound to be some action on that front. And we'll be doing something anyway. Won't all be Falklands business. James, is there something for us in this? If I can tie it up with something else? It's--it's all a bit cranky, small scale stuff. Vegetarians, hippies, disturbed housewives. It's a local radio story, if that. They're mad. Well, just an idea. Now I want to talk about this radio car cockup yesterday. It was an emotional occasion. Hundreds of small craft led by six fire tugs making fountains of water formed an escort flotilla. And four Wasp helicopters flew past in salute. In the city, the Financial Times ordinary share index was down 10 points an hour ago, at 529.8. BBC radio news. My God, we made it. Well done, Charles. I knew you wouldn't let me down. My God, that was close. Whoo. - The second is, uh, less pleasant. A Pole is confronted by a German and a Russian soldier. Which should he shoot first? The German first, the Russian second. Duty before pleasure. I've heard that one at school. Then you are a well-educated young man. Tom has been reciting his English Kings and Queens to me. Me too. Apparently the Cromwells don't count. Haven't you socialist historians in the west made Kings and Queens out of date, do you suppose? We keep trying. I can tell you that the history of the monarchy is alive and well in the national memory. I shot a commercial, a sort of vignette, of Kings and Queens, Henry the Eighth, Mary. Elizabeth the First. Elizabeth the First, and so on. Had a fantastic response. What were you advertising? Oh, some new lager. Oh, I am pleased to hear that there is at least some national memory. I agree with Ann that the British forget too quickly. Here, you have [indistinct], and yet no monuments to those who struggled to win them for you. Now, that is why I think there is hope for the Poles. Whoever occupies their country, they remember their dates and they keep adding to them. December 1981, 1978, '76, '70, cut in 1940, 1920 and so on. It's a subversive list. Say it out loud on the streets of Warsaw and you might get arrested. Good night, oh, no, I'm very tired. Don't turn out the hall light and don't close the door! I won't, good night. Night. I haven't seen much of you. Oh, it's a bit of a mad house. For some reason, a lot of my mother's friends seem to specialize in monologues. Well, he's all right, professor. Um, Susie-- Tom, bed! - Go on. - Susie? Um, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow? I might. You might? Susie, James, are you up there? Hello, Mummy. Betty's made us some coffee. You want some? Yes, we do. Well, we're in the library. You might? Yes, might. Remember you're here to talk to my mother. Ah, Susan, I'm interrogating Matthew. I am asking him how a director of advertisements and a socialist get along so well together. How does the lion lie down with the lamb? By staying in town all week and lying down with several lambs. Not so. We meet halfway. Ann has grown very fond of her material comforts. She even owns land with a Keep Out sign posted on the boundary. I bought a wood because a local farmer was going to cut it down. The signs were already there. And you? Oh, well, I earn so much money at what I do I can't even begin to defend it. I used to shoot a whole line about the value and necessity of advertising. You were more interesting then. Now, I'm an agnostic, and so is Ann. If she'd only admit it. Oh, come on, James. Defend me from this tripe. Well, there's no reason why a socialist shouldn't enjoy comfort. Or own a wood, or even be very rich. The problem is making that available to everyone. - - Rubbish. Absolute-- If everybody is to have everything, then you need to plan very carefully. You need to control the future. This is the tragedy of Marxists. The future is not ours to control. Nothing turns out as we plan. Sorry, tired. I don't have the actual speeches now. You'll have to chase them. Right, I will, thanks. And these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gate Skills , the one they tried to stop. Excuse me, it's a phone call for Mr. Penfield. Take it in here? - - Thanks. Hello? How did you get this number? I see. Um... Look, I'm sorry about last week. No, I'm--I'm up here researching something. Is she? Well can't they give her painkillers or something? Right. Um...no, look, look. I'm s-- I can't just drop everything, it-- Yes, look, well, look, I'll be there. Tell her I'll be there, the day after tomorrow or something. All right? Okay, yes. All right, bye. It's a relative of mine. She's not very well. I'm sorry, what were you saying? Jeremy phoned this morning. Oh, what did he want? He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could all travel down together. Well, that'll be fun. In your car. Why not? Hello? Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you. Well. Don't you want to walk, Tom? No. Actually, I've been once today already. I think I'll stay here with him. James and I have been indoors all morning. Well, he's very keen to go. Susie. See you when you get back. Go? Yes. There was so much hypocrisy, the reasoning. The war had just ended. And the language was very much the same as it had been before the first reform act. A small minority thought that England really belonged to them. They owned it. They made it. And the rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders, intent on wrecking it all. Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Attlee seemed to be under enemy occupation? Did he? I left school and I went to work for the Labor party. My brother George had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member. I hero-worshiped him. He was 25 years old. I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time. They feel betrayed. They want to know what went wrong. What went wrong? Oh, many things. Inertia, Stalin and the Cold War. Lack of nerve. We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care, poured millions into it. And then put the same old duffers in charge. A new broom with very old bristles. I don't like admitting it, but I am happy. Matthew's right, I like comfort. I like being able to do my own work, and not having to teach. I love my house and my garden. And my wood. And I'm very happy walking here with you. You have such a quiet, strong sense of purpose. Energy. Think I can rely on you to take the uncomfortable stands in life. I've done my bit. No! They only go one, two, three, for the last time. - Look, you there were, okay? - Yeah. One, two, three. Yes, but this one, this one can go diagonally that way, can't it? That can go by the square. No, it can't. It went on the starting position, so that can go two. Mm-hmm. But otherwise it can only go one forward... I might give you a ring when we get back to London. Um, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. Can you let me have your number before you leave? Oh, sure. Good. Have you ever seen a television commercial being made? No. You might find it quite interesting. James. You can go one, two, three, or... Excuse me. That's what I did. You went one, two. I wanted to show you. It was taken six months before he died. It's for you, Mr. Fox. All right. All right, thank you, Betty. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, yeah. What's up? James. Hello? Hold on. It's that lady from Norfolk again. I'm not here. Terribly sorry, he doesn't seem to be here at the moment. No. Yes, if I see him I will. Goodbye. She's going to phone back. Next time tell her I've gone away. Mm-hmm. James giving some woman the old heave-ho, hm? Exactly that. And cut. Steve? Not the best, Governor, not the best. All right, we'll go again please. - 2:30. - Come on now, quickly! One more! Call it! - We want some more steam. Last moment, we want a lot more steam. Frank, please give it to her the other way will you darling? - David. - Yeah, Frank. All right, Steven. All right. One more please before lunch! We've got about six minutes! Right. Oh, James, you made it. I'm just gonna do one more take and we'll break for lunch. - Excuse me, please. - Want some coffee? I've got some tea. Oh, you've got some tea? Okay. Right. Here we go. Come on boys. Lots of smiles from our warm, loving, happy family. Quiet please! Right, turn over. - Rolling off you. - Rolling! And mark it. Six, take 12, guide track. Run playback. And cut. Very good, well done. And check the gates, please, check the gates. Break for lunch, please! Just checking the gates. We'll print that one. Well done. My darling, see you soon. Right, James, come on. Let's go before the clients get hold of me. All right? Yeah. Were you impressed? Great clearage, everyone. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, but now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now. The scripts, the acting, the camera work. Everything, we've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. I mean, this, uh, this food we're eating now. What--what would you call that? Ploughman's lunch. Traditional English fare. In fact, it's the invention of an advertising campaign we ran in the early '60s to encourage people to eat in pubs. You're kidding. A completely successful fabrication of the past. Listen, James. There's something else I want to talk to you about. I'm pretty broad-minded. And I'd rather be frank than have everybody... misunderstand one another, if you see what I mean. Susie told me that your visits to Norfolk had, well, um, ulterior motives. She said that? Yes. You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife. Now listen-- No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate beds for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susie hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying, I don't mind. I'm giving you permission. Hello? You don't know me. My name's Edward Long. I'm a friend of James Penfield. He asked me to phone you. I don't know what any of this means, but he said you'd understand. Yes, that's right. He said he's got to go away for a while and that he'll be writing to you, and please don't try and contact him. Hello? God, that was terrible. Don't ever ask me another favor like that. You were wonderful. I'm very grateful. She hung up. Why couldn't you just write to her? I will. Sooner or later. Trouble is I hate writing letters. Now, where do you want to eat? Still in love? I'm not sure. Susan! - Hello, James. - Hi. Darling. You look like an angel. Where's your hat? Oh no! They won't let you in without one. Brighton, James. - - - Don't point it at James! Voila! Cheers. Here's to the 99th Annual Conference of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Association. To the 99th annual conference. ...the 99th annual conference of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Association. Ah, the seaside. Isn't it heavenly? Gorgeous. What have you got there? I look naked without one. What? One of these. Oh, yes, where's mine? I want to look like you. What about James? Oh. We'll see what we can do. Promise? Promise. And there's a farmer just standing there, and he's buttoning up his flies. And behind him you can see all these thousands of sheep, sort of nibbling away peacefully. - And, um, and we lowered him on the ground and the sheep's sort of looking up at him with great big, soft eyes. And we say, yes, but when will I see you again? Oh. I think that's my niece there, excuse me. Shall we have a drink or something? Oh, excuse me. There's Nicky. And then the theory goes, you'll be back in favor and in line for a real job. Is that right? Well, it's a theory. Interesting. Oh excuse me, there's Willie. I want to see him, too. We don't seem to get much time to talk. I know, I'm sorry. [man over PA]Miss Susan Barrington. Miss Susan Barrington. - General Sir James Penfield. Services during the Norfolk campaign. - Hello. - It was they who rebuffed aggression. - They who-- - I've managed to book a table for us at Queens. ...a powerful blow for democracy, human rights, and international order. I believe this will prove of wider significance even than the event itself. We were seen to be fighting to defend principles, which are fundamental to free nations everywhere. And our reputation has been enhanced as a result. Francis is in cracking form, don't you think? you may film me all afternoon if you wish. And he's promised not to talk to the press. It's because he desires you. Women are always get the break from these conferences. It's true. I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beer, huge trousers and braces, and so sweet. They kept looking at my badge which had Press written on it, and saying, "Oh, can I?" And then he was sick on your dress? No, no, he wasn't. He just lowered himself slowly onto a bar stool and said, "Oh, don't feel bad. I had six onion barges, three pots of lard." I gotta go. See you at dinner. "Six onion barges." Great girl. Did you shake the mother off? Yes, finally. Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot. Are you up to something? Employing left wing counselors of neighboring councils. - - Left wing councils... Left wing councils employing Labor candidates in the paid voluntary sector. We now face a professional left, financed at the rate-payer and tax-payer's expense. And just more money is not a solution in itself. As we have given more money to the professional left-- This is not going to be a speech about the Falklands campaign, though I would be proud to make one. - [protestors shouting]- But I want to say just this, for it is true for all our people. The spirit of the South Atlantic was the spirit of Britain at her best. Hear, hear! It has been said that we surprised the world. That British patriotism was rediscovered in those spring days. Mr. President, it was never really lost. But it would be no bad thing if the feeling that swept the country then, were to continue to inspire us. Well, if there was any doubt about the determination of the British people, it was removed by the men and women who, a few months ago, brought a renewed sense of pride and self-respect to our country. They were for the most part young. Let all of us here, and in the wider audience outside, pause and reflect on what we, who stayed at home, owe to those who sailed and fought, and lived and died and won. If this is tomorrow's generation, then Britain has little to fear in the years to come. You will tell the people the truth, and the people will be our judge. Shit! I can't believe it! You're fucking Susan! Jeremy, shit, you're meant to be my friend, - for Christ's sake! - I am. You are a fucking liar! You're a regular pervert. This really is your idea of a good time? Susan and I are very old friends, James. Fuck off. Well, you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that. Oh, God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip. Well, it might have worked. Well, really, I would have been delighted for you if it had. She wasn't interested. Not my fault. You're a piece of shit. I've known Susan for more than 15 years. James, we're old allies. - James, I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it. Well, thanks very much. It's everything we wanted. Very good read. Terrific piece of work. Here's to you, and to Suez. And to history. The days of man are but as grass. For he flourisheth as a flower of the field. For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone. And the place thereof shall know it no more. For as much as it has pleased all mighty God of His great mercy to take onto Himself the soul of our dear sister, here departed. We therefore commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our lowly body that it may be like unto His glorious body according to the mighty workings...
