[leaves rustling] [birds chirping] [flushing] Just another day in paradise. Today and every day. [Sylvia] Still shy after all this time? [scoffs] Sorry, Syl. The way I was brought up. All good, baby girl. [no audible dialogue] Why didn't he tell her he loved her? He was afraid she wouldn't say it back. [thunder rumbling] So I told him to fuck off. And that's when I knew. Smart move. Boom, boom. Yes! Finally! Want to check and update the map? Sure. [radio tuning] [static hisses] [man on radio] It smacks of smoked salmon. You expect they don't have good eyesight, but they have better hearing than a teenager masturbating in a room with a door with no lock on it. So if they find you, you shoot to kill. Go for the head. You kill the brain, you kill the beast. You're out of bullets, you're out of weapons, you aren't out of options. Get yourself to water. The sea, a lake, a river. Your rich neighbor's Olympic-size pool. Jump in. The affected can't swim. They won't follow you in. Meanwhile, I just got an update. Thirteen degrees north, 100 degrees east, is a no-go zone. I repeat, that is a no-go zone. This is DJ, last of the old breed, sending the good word to the good people. Haven, we know you're out there. Come on, be cool. Let us know how to find you. Coming back with more news and advice tomorrow. Same time, same channel... Nothing we don't already know. Except for where Haven is. Why doesn't he ever tell us where it is? Maybe he's hiding too. Maybe. I hope Haven's real. Yeah. But for now, we don't know where it is, we don't know if it exists, so we're staying here. Yeah. Want to finish the movie? Sure. Ready? Almost. Stop smiling. Serious. Pensive. Like a student studying hard. [chuckles] Stop. [laughs] Knock it off. [beeps] [dance music plays on headphones] [animal howling] Another day gone. A good day. Yeah. What do you miss the most? We said we wouldn't talk about that. [Rose] I'm not talking about the past. I'm just asking you what do you miss the most? About the past. Technically. I miss fruit juices. [Sylvia] We have juice. I mean fresh-squeezed ones. I would kill for a durian right now. [chuckles] So what do you miss? Driving. [Rose] Really? [Sylvia] Yeah, I mean, I know it's clich√©, but being alone with your thoughts on the road... Like an escape. Yeah. All the escape in the world. [breathing heavily, moaning] [birds chirping] Just another day in paradise. Today and every day. I've read all the books. Read them again. Your favorites. I do. 'Cause you're a bookworm. Books will expand your mind. My mind expands any more, it's gonna snap. Fuck! Not again. Okay, we have time. [DJ on radio] You've got about a day, maybe more, maybe less. I've seen some people change in five hours, some in three. The outcome's always the same. If one of them bites you, it's game over, man, game over. Just like stupidity, there is no cure. If one of the infected gets its blood on you, you better hope it doesn't go in your mouth, or your eyes. The first signs of infection come after a few hours. Dizziness, sweatiness, craving for water. When that happens, your mind starts to go. Take it from me, if it ever gets to that point, it's better to do yourself in. It is not a good way to die. Meanwhile, I am getting an update from my boys on the ground. The no-go zone has now been extended to 14 degrees north, 99 degrees east. Once again, that is 14 degrees north, 99 degrees east. This is DJ, last of the old breeds, spreading the good word of good people. Haven, we know you're out there. Blah, blah, blah. This next one goes out to all those hot single ladies in my area. It's Nickelback singing Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" on repeat. Don't let me turn. I won't. Do the same for me? I promise. [twigs snap] One left. [generator humming] I swear I closed it. [Rose] The wind. Must have been. We have to be sure. Patrol, weapons check. Today's an awful day. [exhales sharply] I'm starving. Me too. The gas lasted longer last night. Something wrong, maybe? Maybe. We have to go. Tomorrow. Do we? We do. Good night. [sighs] [water flowing] [growls] [birds chirping] [whirring] Two gone, six left. Should be enough. Plenty. Mm. Let's go to the water hole. We have work to do. We have time. It's on the way. We rarely get to leave. [scoffs] There's a reason for that. What's the point of living if we don't have a life? I knew you were going to say that. 'Cause you know me. Please? Okay. [birds chirping] It's clear. I'm gonna go check one more time. No, we've been through this so many times. [clattering] [man] Hey. Hey. Name's Kai. This is my friend Brian. What's your name? [Brian] Take it easy. Take it easy. We're not here to hurt you. We're friendly, okay? Calm down. We live in a community right over here. We have lots of food and water. We're just out searching for more people to join us. Are you living alone? Where do you live? You guys better leave. No, we're not here to hurt you. How many are you? Where are your friends? Hey, guys. It's funny we ran into you. We actually are staying at a resort, like, ten kilometers up. We have lots of food and water. How many people are in your commune? Sorry, what's your name? I'm Kai. [blade swishes] [muffled grunts] [gagging] It's better this way. [brake sets] What are you doing? We need to talk. It's dangerous. So is this. We promised we'd talk everything out. Not right now. Not right here. Yes, right here, right now. We had to do it. No, we didn't. Yes, we did. Have you just forgotten what happened last time? I've kept us alive. Right. All on your own. Trust fund baby saves the world. Yeah. 'Cause a trophy wife sure as hell is not about to do it. And I'll never forget what happened last time. I lost my child. I'm sorry. Drive. Ro. Just drive! [releases brake] We need to unload these. I want to be alone right now. We need to do a perimeter check too. Later! [breathes shakily] [shrieking] We're better off. [low growling] [growling softly] [growling continues] -[clanks] -[growls] [snarls] [roaring] [grunting] [clattering] Ro! [growling] [blows landing] [growling] [raspy growling] [growling] [screaming] [growling] [panting] [raspy breathing] [grunting] [screaming] [growling] [growling intensifies] [screaming] [growling] [shrill growling] [bat clatters] [growling] [growling] [panicked growling] [raspy growling] [screaming] [gasps] I'm so sorry. [panting] Are you okay? Did you get hurt? No. I'm okay. How many are there? I don't know. We have to go now. Okay. Let's go. [distant growling] [growling] [growling] [growling] [panting] How many? I don't know. Like, nine, eight, maybe seven. [sighs] How long do we have? Until this place is swarmed? One, two hours. Tops. [sighs] We have to leave. We do this right, we'll be okay. Never thought this day would come. Yes, we did. Not this soon. We've had a good run, longer than either of us would have thought. We have a plan. We stick to it. If they don't eat us. -We kill 'em all. -What if we just left now? No. We have a plan. It's a good plan. We'll wait. [clicking] [sighs] It won't start. Battery cable's loose. [engine starts] [growling] [door slams] [growling] [motor humming] [growling] [growling] [growling] [gunshots] [growling] [gunshot] [growling] [growling] [groans] [growling] [stabbing] [growling] [screaming] [stabbing] [screeching] You're clear. Let's go out on top, Syl. Do you trust me? Yes. You have to believe me. Everything's gonna be okay. I don't know how, but it's gonna be okay. Yeah, I believe you. [growling] [door closes] [growling] [growling] [growling] [motor humming] [growling] [growling] [gunshot] [water flowing] [growling] Ro! [water splashes] [whimpering] [panting] [cries] [static hissing] [clicks] [DJ] Ladies and gentlemen, it's that time of day again. Get ready for all your favorite sounds of civilization. But first, a message from our sponsors. [clicks] Seems we don't have any messages. Oh, well, here we go. This is DJ, last of the old breed, sending the good word to the good people. Haven, we know you're out there. Come on, be cool, help us out. Let us know where you are. [gunshots] Hold on. [gunshots] Okay, listen very carefully. Our base has been compromised. We're under attack. It is not safe here. Whatever you do, stay away from the old rice mill. Head north. I believe that is where Haven is. Maybe I'll see you there. This is DJ signing off. [gunshots] [people shouting] Jesus. Guns? Yeah. They have guns. What now? We keep surviving. Use whatever it takes. Just another day in paradise. Today and every day. [man singing rock ballad]
