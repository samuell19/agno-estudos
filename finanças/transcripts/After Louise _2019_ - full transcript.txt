AFTER LOUISE Two, three, four, five, six, seven. What are you doing ? We're just playing football. Come here. Don't ! You what ? Two, four, eight, sixteen... You telling me how to deal with the kids ? Thirty-two, sixty-four. Will you get those kids inside ? They've got outfits to try on. Four thousand... Sorry about the kids. Do you... Looks nice, the lawn. Big wedding tomorrow. Mine. Kath. Coming, Dad. I've booked dinner for seven. In your speech tomorrow... I want you to mention mum. I've written something I want you to say. I'm not asking you to get in contact with her. I just wanna hear her name. I know she can't be here, but... I can't get married and pretend she doesn't exist. Dad. Dad ! I asked about mum's birthday once. I was ten or something and he started throwing things around the room. Can't have been easy for him. What about me ? He adores you, Kath. You have to do it for me. Read this for me. Are you sure that's a good idea ? At least if her name's mentioned she'll be part of the ceremony, even if she doesn't know. Yeah. Alright. - Do you mean it ? - Yeah, of course. I love you, Stevie. - Let's go somewhere ! - Now ? Come on ! I wish we could stay like this. - Just me and you. - Yeah. I know. Let's run away. After we're married we can do whatever we want. Because I've never been anywhere. Go back to your party, Mr. Sex God. See you tomorrow. What are you doing ? They're eating the echinacea. What do you do with them ? Postman releases them in the park. - Do up a button, Cheryl. - Why ? - It's a bit... - Too much ? What do you think, Bob ? - There's no letter. - Are you sure, love ? Sorry, Bob. Have you ever asked him who they're from ? He'd say, if he wanted you to know... I need to make a call. Okay. Use my phone, Bob. Morton... M,O,R,T,O,N. - Yes, she's here. - How is she ? - Are you family ? - No. I'm not, but I... - We can only give information to... - Just... Just tell me if she's all right. If you want to come and see her... come soon. I need to talk to you. - What ? - It's important. - No ! - Hold on a minute. Thank you. - This isn't a good time. - I have to go to Bradford. Cheryl... Cover for me. Are you sure you're up to that journey ? If you work it out... write it all down. You know what I mean. You've never been past the garden ! All the time you've worked here. Are you saying you don't trust me ? Bloody hell, Bob, you're still on license. Anything happens, they'll have you back inside. What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Just practising my dance moves for the party. You've got to get married first. Go on, get it off. Be good practice for tonight. Shame to rip it, through nerves... or excitement. And then we'll redo your makeup. Thanks, Pat. You're marrying my boy. Call me mum. Taxi picks you up from the front, train's at four. Gets you to Birmingham New Street. I've written it all out, then it's platform eleven. The seats are all reserved and paid for. This is your itinerary and this is the map from the station to the hotel I've booked for you. Things have changed, Bob. You'll be shocked. I appreciate what you've done for me... Everything you've done for me. I'll see you tomorrow night. Bob, not that way. And of all the fruits in the Garden of Love... To Kath and Steve. To Kath and Steve ! - Go, Stevie ! - Go, Steve ! Thank you, Ken, for those kind thoughts... It's great to know that Kath and I have your support... And you can rest assured, Ken, that I'll do my best to look after her as well as you have... Kath is a beautiful, kind, thoughtful, gentle person... And I don't mean to brag when I say that I'm the luckiest man in the room. - To have her as my wife. - Hear, hear ! My mum. Yeah. Right... Now. Kath has asked me to mention all the absent... Absentees, especially her... ...friends and people... Relatives who couldn't be here today. I'm very sorry about that... The first thing I asked you, as my husband. The first thing. - He told me not to say, he'd walk out. - So do what he wants. What he wants is best for us, Kath. It's about our future, not some stuff that happened years ago. Come on, love birds, there's a 20-grand wedding going on in there. - Any chance of you two joining in ? - We're just coming. Have you told her the good news ? About you moving into the house. Steve, we spoke about all this. Steve ! - Let me. - I'll just... It'll be better for us. All good ? I'll see you in there. I'm just going to the loo. Stevie's waiting to cut the cake. Where is the stupid girl ? Give it to someone inside. Please, anyone. Will you do that for me ? Oh God. What are you doing ? Can you get off, please ? Move ! Oh my God ! - Shut the door ! - He saw me... - Let me out ! - Leave the door alone. - What are you doing ? - Stop ! My Dad's going to kill me. Shit, shit, shit. I have to get the taxi. Alright. Get out and go ! Hurry up, I can't stay here ! Get out or stay in ! Out or in ! - I have to get to the station. - What ? The train station... in 10 minutes. I'll drive you. Stay in ! I think the station's on the left. Or maybe it's on the right. Miss you already. Where are you going ? Bradford. That's on my way. Get in. Don't start counting. Please promise me you won't start counting. Okay. This is not a good idea. I'll be fine. You see, I have it all planned out. - My instructions say... - Forget that. All in the past now. Live dangerously. Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen... What's this ? What the bloody hell is this ? Flourine, neon... We're going to Bradford so just calm down. I don't know the way. - It's up north, isn't it ? - Which way's that ? We're coming from Bournemouth. Everything's north. Me and my mum... She works in a theatre. In Edinburgh. She couldn't come to the wedding so I'm going to... It always seemed like the end of the world, but... But it's just up the road. Have you worked at the hotel long ? You keep the gardens nice... I noticed... I work in a salon. Part time. I do manicures and... things like that. What did you do before ? Have you always been a gardener ? Bloody hell, is it going to be like this all the way to Bradford ? Why are we here ? - I need to get some things. - What things ? Alright, I'm lost. Have you got a mobile ? - Didn't think so. I'll get a map. - You said you knew the way. Well I don't. So... could you get out, please ? All right, I'll climb over you then. Wait ! - Can I get something to eat ? - And a map ? Yes. I've got no money. Is this lunch ? Whatever. I'm having the Olympic Breakfast. I'll have the peas. - Sorry ? - Peas. - That's gammon. - I want the peas. We just do what's on the menu. But it is on the menu, there's a picture of it there. Gammon, coleslaw, pineapple chunk, chips. - And peas. - You can't just have peas. - Why not ? - Do you want to talk to the manager ? Give him the peas and put the other stuff on my plate. Gammon, coleslaw, pineapple chunk, chips and Olympic Breakfast on one plate ? You don't get out much, do you ? You vegetarian ? No. Why all the fuss ? Lunch is something green. I always have something warm and green for lunch. Breakfast ? Fruit. Dinner ? Meat. I didn't eat at the wedding. - I shouldn't eat the beans. - Why ? It's a long car journey. It might not be very... ladylike. Now you can blame it on me. How are you getting on in there, Bob ? I'm assuming you're okay because I don't hear you counting. There's a signpost, Bob. - What does it say ? - Wincanton or Shepton Mallet. It's coming, Bob... Which way, Bob ? - Bob ! - Wincanton. That's Wales, you're looking at Wales. Do you have any idea where we are ? So why did you say Wincanton ? I didn't like the sound of Shepton Mallet... Sounded violent. I'm sorry, you were shouting and that made me anxious. I can't make decisions when I'm... Where the bloody hell are we ? Chop me up, shove me in a bin bag and dump me in the bushes. - Make it a perfect day ! - Calm down, Kath. Breathe. Just start by counting to four as you breathe in and four as you breathe out. What ? Is this how it starts ? You'll have me on sodding lists in a minute. Let's sit quietly and we can plan a route. No. You can get out and hitch. You'll be fine. For a weirdo, you look extraordinarily harmless. But... Who'll read the map ? I should be on my honeymoon... Don't know where we were going, it was going to be a surprise. Not as big a surprise as this though... I think that was your fault... No, no... This is definitely wrong. Look. Oh, my God, this is the place. No, we haven't got time. Give me your knife. Don't worry, I won't slash my wrists. Trust me. We have to press on. Don't touch that. It's written everywhere. Kath ! Kath ! Kath ! Kath, are you in there ? - What's your game ? - I'm looking for... Bloody pervert. You having a laugh now ? Here ! - Kath ! - Somebody get the police. Kath ! Alright ! What's going on ? He's trying to look in the loo at my kiddy. He was looking for me, that's all. - Did she do this to you ? - We need to go. Did you hit him ? He shouldn't hang around ladies loos, should he ? You can't just go around thumping people. There's a paedophile standing there and you're having a go at me now. - Just get him out of here ! - Look, he's traumatised her. Is she smoking ? You're one of those people that attract trouble, aren't you ? Why would you even think you could get to Bradford if you're like this ? No I am actually asking you... Why are you going to Bradford ? Nothing to say on that front ? Alright. Let's talk about me. Aren't you itching to know all about my exciting life ? You ruined it for me. I'm sorry. What a pair. - What are you doing ? - Trying to find the lights. You can't switch on the lights ? - What does that one do ? - The wipers. - And what about those ? - Will you stop interfering ? - Well done. - Are you being sarcastic ? No ! I'm just glad that you managed to turn the lights on... It's quite useful... if we're going to be driving in the dark. - We should find somewhere to stay. - No. - I can hardly keep my eyes open. - I have to get to Bradford. - You will. - I have to get there now. Why ? What now ? I swear to God, this car is not moving until you talk to me. Please. There's someone I have to see... Before... Yes... I think she might be dying. Oh... Who is she ? Isn't that enough ? Shit ! You are the worst driver ! - Shut up. - What happened ? I lost concentration for a second. - Ever since you dragged me into... - I did not drag you into the car. - You think I want to be here ? - I fell asleep. I told you I was tired but you made us carry on and I fell asleep. I'm finding somewhere to stay the night. Okay. You'll have to get out and push. Are you ready ? Well done. Well done. Now help me stay awake. One man went to mow, Went to mow a meadow, One man and his dog Woof-woof. Went to mow a meadow, Two men went to mow, Went to mow a meadow... Two men... And his dog, Woof-woof Went to mow a meadow... Three men went to mow, Went to mow a meadow... Three men, two men, one man and his dog Went to mow a meadow. Twelve men went to mow, Went to mow a meadow... Twelve men, eleven men, ten men, nine men, eight men, seven men, six men, Five men, four men, three men, two men, one man and his dog, woof-woof... Okay, thank you, Bob, you can stop now. Went to mow a meadow. You're lucky. We have one room left. Is it okay ? - Yes ! - No ! - Well ? - Thank you. Have fun ! D'you mind if I use the bathroom first ? All yours. I'll just... Will you be alright on that ? You need to rest. Can we set out early ? Wake me. Kath ? Is that you ? Dad. Is that her ? Don't be angry with me. Why have you done this ? I don't know, I didn't plan it. Let me speak to her ! Come back ! I'm going to find Mum. You can't. I can, Dad, I can do whatever I want. Don't try to be like her. You're not like her ! Where is she ? She's looking for her mother. It's not right you keeping Kath from her mother. Where is she ? Where's Kath's mother ? It's not you. She's got a lovely body, whoever she is. Much better than mine. Is it her ? You trying to make me jealous, Bob ? How come you can draw like that ? We were at art school. You are full of surprises, aren't you ? So... You were you thinking about her last night ? I think about her all the time. What's her name ? Louise. She's my whole life. The beginning... And the end of everything. It's beautiful. I know this trip is a big deal for you. It might help if we talk about it. I want to help you. Don't you get it ? I like you, I'm only asking because I like you. You don't know me. - I still like you though... - Why ? I don't know... I like that you don't kill the snails, I like that you can eat peas without shooting them all over the table, I like that you carry a penknife... I like that you can make anything beautiful. The picture, the garden. I like that you're nothing like anyone else I've ever met before. FUCK OFF BRADFORD I've bloody well done it. I said I'd get you to Bradford and I have. You know where you're going ? The... The train station. I thought I threw that out of the window. - I should have been here yesterday. - I'm sorry. Sorry. I can come with you. - Bob, wait. - I have to go. - I'm late already. - Let me come with you then. Thank you... Thank you for driving me but I have to go now. I can take you to... where ever she is. I'm here now. And you have to go and find your mother. That's it ? Bob, wait, his is crazy... Bob. Please don't leave me. I can wait for you somewhere. Can I do that ? - So you can find your mother... - I don't want your money. You've helped me, I don't need it. I have a return train ticket. I'll call you at the hotel. In Bournemouth. Sorry... Sorry, Bob. The number you have dialed has not been recognized. Please check and try again. The number you have dialed has not been recognized. Please check and try again. I know this must be awful for you... But I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry... for what happened... And I know that nothing will ever change... Eeverything stopped because of what I did... But I want you to know that I never let myself forget... I have never let myself have a moment of happiness... Of life... Since Louise died. Kath ? Dad, I'm sorry I hung up. Don't leave me. Dad. I just want what's best for you. It's all I've ever wanted. - I'm not doing this to hurt you. - Then come back... Come back and we'll talk about her. No, talk about her now. Just come home. You're a coward dad, a bloody coward. - Kath. - And I love her because she's brave. She's dead, Kath. You're lying. She jumped off a tower. That's how brave she was. That's not true ! Six months after she left us... You kept asking if it was your fault... How could I tell you she'd killed herself ? You were eight. How could I lay that on you ? Come on, Bob. Where are you ? Bob ? I've thought about everything she might be doing her whole life. And everything I did, I wondered what she'd think of it. She'd be angry or proud, she'd laugh, or cry, or get bored. And she's been dead this whole time. I've been living my life through a dead person. What am I supposed to do now ? She made me think she was so, so wonderful, that poor, stupid little Kath could never do anything, never get out, never live. But we can live... It's alright... Forget about everything. It's just us now. Why are you so scared of everything ? Why are you so scared of me ? Why ? - Come on ! Why ? - Don't. Is this what you're frightened of ? Is this what you're frightened of ? Is this what you're scared of ? Is it ? Yes ! Because I killed her ! I killed her... That's why I can't touch you, that's why I can't touch people. - You killed Louise ? - Yes. We rented a cottage, a wild place. We argued. Stupid argument. She hit me. I hit her. She fell. She was still alive. I had to get her across the marsh... I started to sink. I wanted to die with her. They said I'd raped and tried to bury her. I didn't argue. I wanted to go to prison for as long as possible. And then the letters started. Her mother writing me these awful awful letters. But they changed over the years. It was like... She wasn't writing to me anymore, she was writing for Louise... To keep her alive. For us both. Just the letters, always letters... And then the letters stopped. So that's why we're here. Come on ! There's no A&E here. - We've here to see... - No, it's way past visiting hours. Morton. Elizabeth Morton. Are you Robert ? I can't give you long. Is that you ? I have something for you. Steve. Hey. How did you find me ? The manager of the hotel said the old guy never took his cab... - Is my dad here ? - No, he doesn't know I've come. So your driving's not improved. I'm sorry I let you down, Kath. I should have listened to you. No. - Let's sit in the car. - No. I have to tell you something. It's about your mum. I know, Steve. He shouldn't have kept that from you. I'm glad he did... I needed her... I never would have left you if I knew she was dead. But I love you, Kath. Do you Stevie ? Let's find somewhere, just the two of us. That's what you said before. I want a divorce. We're too young to be married... Let's start again. You have to go now. Take it. I have to talk to him. You saw her ? He came for you. Do you love him ?
