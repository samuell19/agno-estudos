"'Go out and kill,' commands father Sam. I am here on earth to create havoc and terror." New York, 1977. A gunman is targeting young couples. He pulled something out of his pocket and started firing into the car. And I was yelling out for help, and then I collapsed over the roof of the car. The NYPD believe a serial killer is on the loose, but they have no leads. Then, on may the 30th, famed journalist Jimmy breslin opens a letter from the killer. "Mr. Breslin, sir, I am a monster. I am the son of Sam." That name caught fire. He came out of the dark, and the dark became a time to fear. There was this sort of overriding sense that you could be next, or someone you know could be next. It felt really apocalyptic. We're all scared. A bizarre, sick mind had just declared war on New York. 40 years later, detectives, witnesses, and survivors relive the hunt for a serial killer. Up until now, none of US have ever come forward. I could never forgive him for what he's done. captions paid for by discovery communications July 1976. Disco is at its peak. The club scene is thriving, especially in New York City. It was a time when women felt a new freedom to be "me," if you will, and to be single and go out and date. People had a good time. It felt like, to me, the world's most dangerous amusement park, but I really liked that. It was a great place to be because there was always something to get into. 18-year-old Donna lauria is caught up in the excitement of the disco era. Beautiful and ambitious, she's working as a medical technician and studying for her paramedic's license. I think Donna was really happy at the time. She was doing something she wanted to do, and that was going along well. And, you know, we were growing up, and, you know, things were good. On July 29th, Donna lauria and her friend Jody valenti are on their way home after visiting some clubs in Manhattan. It's 1:00 in the morning. The two women are parked in front of Donna's apartment building in Jody's car. My dad was not thrilled that it was that time, and dad and Donna had a little exchange about, "it's late. You know, come on. You need to come upstairs." She told him she would, but go get her dog, and that they would walk the dog together. The father says, "well, I'm gonna go up and get the dog and come down." Everything typical, no problem, and suddenly, the world explodes around them. Some guy just came out of the shadows and fired and shot them. By the time I got there, she was already on the pavement outside the car. I checked her for a pulse, and... And there was nothing I could do. She was dead by the time I got down there. And I just... There was just nothing. I mean, it was horrible. The shocking attack on Donna lauria and Jody valenti gets reported, but the tragedy passes almost unnoticed. New York is in the grip of a terrible crime wave. In 1976, it is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, with over 1,700 murders this year alone. You had bombings down in Brooklyn. We had police that were shot. Banks were being robbed. Murder was up. Rape was up. Armed robbery was up. You know, there was a lot of desperation. We had so many homicides in those days. The sheer number of cases was overwhelming. With the city on the verge of collapse, can anyone hope to find Donna lauria's killer? "I love to hunt, prowling the streets looking for fair game, tasty meat. I live for the hunt." Al Howard and Richard Paul of Bronx homicide catch the case. From the start, they realize this is going to be emotionally difficult. You have children of your own, and you can't figure out the reason. Why would anybody want to shoot two young ladies just sitting in the car? They wonder if the location of the murder might be a crucial lead. When we got the Donna lauria case, that was up in the Bronx. There was an area up there where the mafia guys would dump their bodies in this park area. One of my partners thought that maybe it was an offshoot of a mafia problem up there. The attack on Donna does resemble a mafia-style hit. A case of mistaken identity? Or could she have been caught up in something like this? The detectives start to investigate rumors. We developed information that Donna had a boyfriend. And when they broke up, he threatened her life. Vinny was maybe 20, 21, and he was sort of a wannabe wise guy. Rich Paul searches for the murder weapon. If he can link Donna's ex to the gun, he'll have his killer. Well, the only evidence we had in the shooting was the bullet that was recovered, the .44-caliber bullet, and that was unusual. So we knew within a day or two what kind of gun was used. The murder weapon is a .44-caliber pistol called the charter arms bulldog. Hey, Mario. Detective Paul can link vinny with exactly that type of gun. He's been seen with someone who was buying one, but he denies it. I'd never heard charter before this particular shooting, so it wasn't a common weapon for US to run into. But it's a big bullet. That kind of gun is designed to do a lot of destruction when it hits you. So we figured, once we find this gun, and we test-fire it, we're gonna have the murder weapon here. Once the police are able to trace the gun, can they link it to Donna's ex? Or perhaps they're on the wrong track. They test-fired it, and they sent the bullet up, and it was not the bullet. For that two or three weeks, I was convinced that vinny was the murderer. Of course, now you come up with nothing after you have ... where do you go from this? You have no motive. You have nothing. So the case started to get really pretty cold. For three months, Donna lauria's death was just another unsolved murder... Until a new crime offers a strange link. In 1976, I was 20 years old and, um... Smoked pot. Smoked a lot of pot and, you know, listened to the grateful dead and the allman brothers. To me, that kind of makes me a hippie. In October 1976, Carl denaro's life is about to change. He's joined the air force and is celebrating one of his last nights as a civilian in the company of a young woman called Rosemary Keenan. Her dad was a cop. And on a few occasions I'd be at her house, you know, with other people. And, you know, her dad would come in, and he'd take one look at me with the long hair and the earring, and, you know, he wasn't a big fan of mine. There was a neighborhood bar. There were some girls hanging out at the bar that I knew, and I went over, said hello to them, and started talking to Rosemary. Apparently, she was there specifically looking for me. This is where Rosemary and I left that evening. And we got in her car, and she drove straight down 164th street. You know, lovers' lanes were wherever you made them, really. You know, if you had someone with a car, and you were dating someone, you would find an abandoned street, you know, where you could sort of be in the car and talk and maybe kiss a little bit or whatever the case is. I mean, the worst you thought that could happen is that someone might see you. But it never... At least, it never crossed my mind that something bad could happen. "Sometimes, the need to kill becomes so overwhelming that I fear myself. I'm certain there is something inside me, an alien presence, this need to obtain blood and kill." Looking ahead, there was ... the streetlight that's there was actually out that night, so it was kind of dark. And we pulled over right about here. You know, we talked a little bit, made out a little bit, and all of a sudden... Five shots ring out. Carl is hit. He doesn't really know at first that he's hit. I looked down, and I had, you know, pieces of glass embedded in my hands and my arms. I didn't see anything. I just assumed the car blew up. Rosemary, scared, frightened, terrified. She drives back to the bar to get him help. Vinny, the doorman, opens the door and says, "Carl, you don't look too good." And I said, "I don't feel too good." And when I sat down, my head went down, and my long hair was holding in blood from my head wound, and my shirt turned bloodred within seconds. The bullet has shattered Carl's skull, and surgeons work through the night to save him. Detective Richard Paul hears about the shooting the next morning. One of my partners was on the way into work, and he had the local news station on. And he said to me, "hey, you know, rich, there was a shooting in queens that sounds like your kind of thing." And we found out that the bullet that was used was probably a .44-caliber bullet. And so we had some inkling that these were connected. But the new shooting is in queens, a different borough and a different police precinct. And the local detectives, including Rosemary's own father, redmond Keenan, take a very different view of the case. Two detectives come in, and one of them was Rosemary's father. I guess my first reaction was, "crap," you know? He didn't like me before. He's not gonna like me at all now. Basically, they harassed me. Now, you have to realize, I'm sitting there. I'm in really bad pain. And they said, "so, what happened?" And I said, "I don't know." And they said, "well, who did it?" I said, "I have no idea who did it." They thought it was a drug deal gone wrong. I knew it wasn't a drug deal because, you know, I smoked pot, but I ... you know, I don't deal drugs. But I had no other answers. In the middle of a citywide crime wave, and with a drug deal used conveniently to explain the attack on Carl, there's no follow-up on the possible connection to Donna lauria's murder three months earlier. It will take another attack before cops start to see the pattern. January 31, 1977. One of New York's coldest winters on record. It's six months since Donna lauria's murder and three months since the attack on Carl denaro. Christine freund and her fiancé, John diel, had been out to dinner in queens. And now it's late. John parks his car, which is a firebird, the hot car of the times. And he parks it at station Plaza, which is the stop for the long island railroad. This is the exact location where John's car was parked. And they parked her for a while, talking about their future. They were planning a wedding. They were talking about children. They were talking about all of these things that a young couple would be talking about, and that was interrupted that night. "I am the demon from the bottomless pit. I take the lives of those who are not willing to give them up." They're just sitting talking, and the world explodes. Christine is bleeding, and John gets out, screaming for help. He tries to stop motorists, who will not stop. Here's this crazed individual trying to save the love of his life. Marlin Hopkins of queens homicide is among the first detectives to reach the scene. I looked inside the car, and I saw Christine. She was slumped over with a lot of blood on the dashboard and the windshield and the side window. This is a picture I acquired from the family of Christine freund. Long brunette hair, pretty girl. Long life ahead of her. The emotions that I was feeling then, I'm starting to feel them now. Christine's fiancé, John, is uninjured, and detective Hopkins is suspicious. It could be he just innocently was there, or he could be the shooter. Murders usually occur between people who know each other. But ballistic analysis proves beyond a doubt the shooter fired from outside the car and not inside. So, John, he went through this whole thing of interrogation, hypnosis, lie detectors. Was that unsettling for him? Sure, definitely was. I felt for him after a while because I realized it wasn't him. Hopkins is unaware of the earlier shootings and wonders whether the unusual caliber of the bullets might provide a clue to the killer. This is the caliber of bullet that we were dealing with at the time. Huge bullet to be fired in a pistol. Finally, the connection with the previous attacks becomes clear when captain Joe borrelli of queens homicide becomes involved in the investigation. One of the detectives said, "you know, we had a shooting in queens. Two young girls were shot and wounded, and it was a large-caliber bullet." He said that redmond Keenan's daughter was in a car where the boy was shot, and that was a large bullet. Detectives contact other police precincts, and they soon discover a fourth large-caliber shooting. Two months earlier, Donna demasi and joanne lomino were shot and badly wounded by an attacker with a .44 pistol. We had a lot of .44-caliber bullets, which...a coincidence only goes so far. It's a huge breakthrough. For the first time, the police confront a chilling possibility ... that all the attacks are the work of the same killer. "I am he, the son of Sam, who fears nothing I destroy. Who can understand the mysteries of the forces of darkness?" Once the New York police department identified the potential that it was the same person, it raised the specter of the fact that it could happen to anyone at any time in any place. When you have somebody like this, and now you're starting to understand that you have a serial killer, that changes the game. Captain Joe borrelli sets up a task force, choosing officers who have worked the individual attacks, including Richard Paul, marlin Hopkins, and Rosemary Keenan's father. They are under no illusions about the difficulty they face. When you investigate homicides, one of the hardest to investigate is a stranger-on-stranger, because there's no motive. The team soon discovers the attacks have a lot in common, including the appearance of the victims. Young women, long dark hair, sitting in cars at night, shot suddenly through the glass by an unknown individual who would then run off. Even Carl denaro fits the pattern. Of course, still being in my hippie stage, I had long brown hair, and I was sitting in the passenger's seat. So it wasn't too much of a leap to assume that I was mistaken for a female. New yorkers have no idea there's any danger. Life goes on as before. But in the tabloid newsrooms, reporters are beginning to catch the scent of a big story. As early as January, I think police began to see a connection between these killings, but they didn't make that public. Rumors kept floating into the newsroom. Journalists were beginning to also think that there might be a pattern. Brian Kates was a reporter at the daily news. His mission was to out-report his rivals at the New York post. Well, in those days, there's no question. A popular newspaper does rely on some kinds of crime. Be first. Sell the news. Imagine, sell the news. That's what was important. Murder was definitely a commodity. And I was fortunate at the time working the night shift, 'cause that's when murder usually takes place. The press are now sniffing around these cases for a story, and the police don't want them to disclose any important leads. We certainly didn't want to disclose that we knew we had a charter arms .44 pistol that was probably involved in all the shootings because all the person would have had to do was get rid of that gun, and we would have had nothing to go on if they didn't confess. So we kept that as quiet as we could. The cops were sort of, really, just waiting for the other foot to drop, I.e., another bloodbath. On march the 8, 1977, captain Joe borrelli gets the call he's been dreading. 1977. A serial killer is behind four apparently random attacks in New York. Two young women have been killed and four people badly wounded. An NYPD task force has been set up to find the killer. The only lead they have is the gun used in the attacks ... a .44-caliber pistol. Then, on march the 8th, detectives are called to another attack. There's this very pretty young girl just laying there, and some guy had come up, some stranger, and killed her right there. It gets to you after a while, you know? Sometimes, you get feelings. Our preliminary investigation at this time is very uncertain, and we don't have too many facts to go on. The victim is 19-year-old Virginia voskerichian, a language student at Columbia university. Virginia is shot just a few streets from where Christine freund was killed, but there are important differences. The police wonder if they are linked. This may not be the same thing. It's just a coincidence, because here's a girl walking down the street and Christine was in a car. It's about 7:30 at night, and this lovely young girl, someone walks towards her, pulls a gun. She sees the perpetrator, puts her books up in front of her face, hoping to stop the bullet. The bullet passes through the books and her face, and she's dead. Ballistics confirm this is the work of the same .44-caliber killer. The fact that he's attacked not in the dead of night, but early evening is disturbing, and it means one thing to detectives ... he's getting bolder. They killed a girl again. Here, I never hear those things. What happened now? It's a tragic thing. I think something should be done about it. NYPD psychologist Harvey schlossberg joins the investigation to begin profiling the killer. Serial killers generally tend to progress in what they do. They increase the anger, the damage that they do to the victim, so they tend to build it up more and more. The killer's attacks have focused on the Bronx and queens. The NYPD intensify patrols, but they're starting to realize the scale of the challenge they face. Imagine, at this time, we're looking in two boroughs, which comprise a million people. And you're looking for somebody that's just driving around randomly shooting people. It was like looking for a needle in the haystack. Two days after the voskerichian attack, police decide it's time to go public. New York mayor Abe beame stages a press conference, and for the first time, the public hears that a serial killer is at large in their city. During the last few weeks, new yorkers have been subjected to a series of criminal outrages, which are unmatched in recent memory. Surprisingly, mayor beame reveals a critical detail. It was the mayor that disclosed the caliber of the gun, which we thought was insane. Right now, if the killer takes that gun and throws it away, the chances are they will never catch him. So, there's the dilemma you always face. The investigators, they want to hold back, but the public has to know. "Let's see how ready you are. You guys have made me very angry. So kiss my ass, all you bitches." The police are worried that their best evidence is now public, and the press make a huge story of it. Well, now, after that press conference, as a journalist, intriguing, intriguing. Frightening, but intriguing. The press was able to give a name to the shooter ... the .44 caliber killer. There were stories almost daily, it seemed. That got everyone's attention at that moment, 'cause suddenly, they had linked these shootings possibly to one person, and it had a name. It was like Jack the ripper or the Boston strangler. You had a person, an image, an icon, and that kicked off a genuine frenzy. Yeah, you have to be careful. You have to watch where you go now, you know, how late you stay out. I feel kind of spooked about it, you know? You might sit down there one night and get shot. We used to stay in front of my house and park and, you know, and kiss good night, but we can't do that no more. Everyone became fearful. What would happen if they went out, if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, in the wrong car in the wrong street? Would they survive? This is headquarters for one of the most intense manhunts in the history of New York ... the search for the .44 caliber killer. Operating out of this office, over 50 of the city's best detectives pore over clues and run down leads. The good thing about getting information from the public is, it gives you leads, because the eyes and ears are out there. And hopefully, one of those will work. The downside is that there's... Too much information comes across. And he states that this informant has been reliable in the past? Information came in from all over the world. People from Europe. We got letters from, I think, even Australia and places like that. The press did create a situation where I'd never seen it, like, in all my years. Did they create a sense of fear at all? Sure. But is all this media attention exactly what the killer wants? Serial killers are often unsuccessful nobodies who feel powerless. But through killing, they can hold an entire community, a whole city in a grip of terror, and it makes them feel extremely powerful. This is a niche where the only pleasure comes from killing. Nobody can satisfy him, nothing, except getting away with a killing and picking up where he left off. The police know they must find the killer fast. Their focus is now on trying to predict where he might strike next. We come up with the idea that, "hey, you just shoot somebody, you're probably getting away in a car," because all of these cases in queens and in the Bronx, there was an access road, a main artery. It was, up in the Bronx, it was the hutchinson river parkway. In queens, we had the Van wyck expressway. The police focus more patrols on places that are not only magnets for young couples, but are also close to major roads. And they also use other rather less orthodox tactics. They wound up getting these mannequins, female mannequins, and we put the mannequin in the car with a detective. Put them in a location we thought might be suspect ... lovers' lanes that are back away from the traffic and so on, places that we kind of felt he might go to. But then the word come back, saying, "it's no good because there's no movement, you know, if he's looking." Then we wound up putting wigs on male detectives. And I'll never forget. I was standing there one night. Ronnie marsunnesson was going out with Richard Paul. And Ronnie turned around, and he said to Richie, he says, "remember, now, when you kiss me tonight, keep your eyes open 'cause this guy sneaks up on US." I'll give you the honest version of this thing. If this individual was riding around and he spotted these things, he was gonna shoot into the car, I don't think either one of US had any intentions of arresting him. I think we had the intention we were gonna start shooting when he started shooting, and the whole thing would have been over. As the weeks pass, mannequins and cops in wigs aren't able to lure the killer. Captain borrelli is prepared to consider any lead, even a supernatural tip-off. I was in my office in the 15th homicide, and the phone rings. The caller was a hispanic man, and he told me, "my wife has these special powers." And he said, "this is what she's saying. He's gonna strike again, the killer. He's gonna strike on a street that's not a street, and a parkway, but it's not a parkway. He's gonna kill two people ... a man and a woman. They're gonna be in a car that's black and red. And he's gonna speak to you." Then, on April 17th, officers are called to a scene that bears an eerie similarity to the psychic's prediction. And it was on the service road of the hutchinson river parkway. It wasn't a street, and it wasn't the parkway. The car is black and red. The man and the woman are killed. And at that scene, there was a note left addressed to me. "I love to hunt... -"I love to hunt... Prowling the streets looking for fair game, tasty meat." The women of queens are the prettiest." Captain borrelli read the letter to the task force, and silence. Total silence. Now it's personal. It's April 17th, 1977, when detectives from the task force are called to the scene of a terrible double murder carried out by the man the press has dubbed the .44 caliber killer. Valentina suriani and her boyfriend, Alexander esau, had been sweethearts since high school. Nancy suriani genovese is Valentina's sister. Val and Alex hung out probably a couple of times a week. He seemed very proper. They seemed to enjoy each other's company. The night that this happened, val was feeling a little under the weather. My mom said, "why don't you just stay home?" But she was an adult, and she went out that night, and that was it. Valentina suriani seems to confirm the killer's preference for brunettes, and, as in other attacks, the couple are parked in a lovers' Lane. For Valentina and Alex, it was tragically a case of wrong time, wrong place. Valentina was very smart, very clever, funny, but very, very honest. She spoke from the heart. "Now, I don't know where i'm going or if I'll ever arrive, but the trip is living, the fare is life, and I love being alive." That's by Valentina suriani. It's heartbreaking, it really is, because you feel that if you could solve this thing, this wouldn't be happening, so it's a big challenge for everybody. A letter is found just steps away from the murder scene, addressed to captain borrelli. Police now have an unprecedented lead ... communication directly from the killer. It gives the police their first glimpse into his mind. The killer left a note filled with crazed obscenities, with threats, with what seemed to be satanic symbols. "Police, let me haunt you with these words ... I'll be back. -"I'll be back. I'll be back. -I'll be back... To be interpreted as 'bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!' yours in murder, Mr. Monster." Detective bill Clark is part of the NYPD task force investigating Valentina's murder. The suriani and esau case introduced a big escalation in the investigation and became a true "we got to solve this or else," because he's throwing the gauntlet down and we know he isn't stopping. Serial killers like to leave information to taunt and to tease the police. They want to show that they're smarter than the police officers who are on the case. "I am deeply hurt by you calling me a woman hater. I am not. But I am a monster. I am the son of Sam." The thing about the letter that kind of really opened the door was that he signed it with a name. He is now the son of Sam. And it was a whole bunch of, "is his father's name Sam?" Is that where we have to look?" Police psychologist Harvey schlossberg is building up a profile of the killer. Originally, from the best I could put together was, he liked to be a voyeur, a peeping Tom, and then that spread out to watching more sexual kind of scenes, and, ultimately, his big pleasure came from interfering with lovers in cars where they parked to make out ... you know, young couples. It would appear that the .44 caliber killer did not want to have any contact with his victims. It was very easy for him psychologically to pull the trigger when he didn't have any contact with the victims. It's much more difficult to kill someone with your hands, with a knife, but in this case, there was no contact. The profile helps investigators identify a possible suspect, so they follow reports of a mysterious gunman who shoots at vehicles and lives in the vicinity of two of the son of Sam attacks. He had an apartment on the second floor. As a bus would go by or a truck would go by, he'd shoot it from his window. I said, "this is weird." Detective marlin Hopkins searches the suspect's apartment, hoping to find the .44-caliber murder weapon. He said, "you can check out my apartment. It's no problem." Bad move. We went into the apartment. A slew of guns ... rifles, pistols. And we went through all of them. I arrested him for that. But no .44-caliber. That was a downer. Then, on may the 30th, 1977, there is a dramatic development in the offices of the New York daily news. The son of Sam has sent a second letter, a much longer one, this time to columnist Jimmy breslin. "Mr. Breslin, sir, don't think that because you haven't heard from me for a while that I went to sleep. No, rather, I'm still here, like a spirit roaming the night." The letter was very eerie. I mean, you know, then you know that he read something that you wrote and that, somewhere out there, he's reading again what you wrote. At the daily newsat that time, Jimmy breslin was the top columnist. People bought the daily news simply to read Jimmy breslin, so if anyone wanted to speak to New York, the best way to speak to New York was through Jimmy breslin. Brian Kates is in the newsroom when breslin receives the letter from the killer. When the newsroom saw this, we were, first of all, stunned and then ecstatic and then realized the implications of this. Suddenly, the press, the media, and the daily news in particular, were no longer observers in this scenario, but participants. We were part of this story. On June the 5th, the daily news prints a dramatic excerpt of the son of Sam's letter, along with an invitation from breslin to the killer. "If he wants further contact, all he has to do is call or write me at thedaily news. The time to do it is now." The story flies off the newsstands, becoming the best-selling edition of all time. Residents of New York now realize they're in the grip of a crazed killer. This has become the summer of Sam. Suddenly, we went overnight from the .44 caliber killer to son of Sam. Is this part of a game? You know? It just ... you know, it's like the city froze. It's one of those crimes that's been, I guess, has been visited upon man throughout the ages ... a demented killer, and you don't know how to stop him. Breslin's coverage in the daily news fuels rival newspapers. Steve dunleavy wrote about the son of Sam for the New York post. Every journalist involved, we're looking for an edge, any kind of an edge. They had an artist's impression of what he would look like. They'd bring in psychiatrists to say what kind of an illness did he have. One of the psychiatrists that was interviewed said that the son of Sam is probably impotent because of the gun and all. You know how many calls we got to the task force office, women giving up impotent guys? I mean, it was unbelievable. We're all scared. Cops were scared. I was scared. My wife was scared. My kids were scared. A bizarre, sick mind had just declared war on New York. The summer of 1977, and New York is gripped by terror. A serial killer calling himself the son of Sam is stalking young couples, and his threatening notes to the police and the press make it clear he is calling the shots. New York mayor Abe beame steps up the hunt to catch the killer. He increases the size of the task force, making it the largest in New York's police history. Since publication of the son of Sam letter to Jimmy breslin, leads have been pouring in to police, including a promising one from a parole officer. He had gotten a letter written in the same-type handwriting as the son of Sam. The letter writer has a criminal record for robbery and has been sending notes to his parole officer, his university professor, and even to the police. There was no way that we could exclude him other than, "let's put this guy under surveillance, go on and see what he does." On the night of June 27, 1977, police tail the suspect into the New York subway. He got on the subway and jumped off at the last minute, and the guys lost him. At the same time police lose their suspect, 17-year-old Judy placido is among the dancers at the elephas, a popular nightclub in queens. She's just graduated high school, and she's celebrating. Every borough had its share of discos, and I think elephas was probably one of the more popular ones in those days. Police have already identified the elephas as a possible target. They have a patrol car outside. Inside, Judy placido has met 20-year-old Salvatore Lupo. At about 3:00 A.M., he offers to take her home. When finally they leave elephas, they go to his car, this red Cadillac, and they sit in the car, and they actually, ironically, discuss the son of Sam. Without warning, a gunman approaches and fires three shots into the car. One of the bullets enters Judy's head, spins around, and stops just over her eye. Think about those chances, that getting hit by a .44 doesn't penetrate your skull. Judy is hit with all three shots, and sal Lupo is wounded in the arm. The police patrol misses the incident by mere minutes. They had returned to the station at the end of their shift. I mean, I can't describe to you the looks on these two detectives' faces. They must have thought immediately, "I hope it's not the son of Sam." But it turned out it was. I went out to the elephas shooting shortly after it happened. If you can imagine a scene with police tape everywhere, flashing lights, police lights, ambulance lights, and so you go kind of hopelessly fumbling from one cop to another, asking people, "did you see anything? Did you hear anything?" The answer to all of those things was no. You kept thinking, "how is nobody catching this guy? How is somebody walking the streets with a giant gun and shooting people, and nobody's seeing this?" This guy has got to be the luckiest guy in the world that he can do these things and nobody sees them, you know. It was a hell of a lot of pressure. Every day, you were getting calls from politicians, the mayor's office, the police commissioner. "What do you got? What do you hear? But what are you working on?" With no direct witnesses to this attack, police intensify surveillance on their best suspect ... the letter writer who eluded officers on the subway. In all this chaos, little attention is paid to some strange letters reported by a civilian police dispatcher named wheat carr. Initially, the letters that we received complaining about the dog were disturbing. They didn't make sense, so we didn't put a whole lot of credence to them initially. The carr family live in yonkers, Westchester county, just a few miles north of the Bronx. She and her father, Sam, had been getting more and more anxious about these strange letters complaining about their dog, Harvey. "Samuel carr, I've asked you kindly to stop that dog from howling all day long. I can see that there shall be no peace in my life or my family's life until I end yours." We had, all along, been reporting the letters and the threats to the police department, but still not taking it as seriously as we should until, one afternoon, the dog, Harvey, was shot. Wheat carr informs her police colleagues in yonkers, hoping that an investigation will now be launched. I became aware of it after the dog was shot. More than likely, in those situations, it's impossible to prove who did it. Sergeant novotny looks into the case, but nobody imagines how these letters might link to the son of Sam. Back in the city, there are far more serious matters to address. A power blackout plunges New York into darkness, unleashing crime and chaos. New York had one of those little, you know, New York moments and went kind of nuts, and just lootings and fires, and it was a bad, bad night. Eventually, though, a lightning storm came through, and so you would hear all the sound, and then this lightning would hit, and it would illuminate the street, and you suddenly see people running, and there would be a cop car going by. There would be all this sort of going on and just noise and glass and screaming. It felt really apocalyptic. It really felt like New York had finally come to an end. But hovering over all of this was the idea that there was a serial killer still running around. The police are no closer to finding him, and so the growing sense of desperation leads anxious new yorkers to take matters into their own hands. If the cops ain't gonna do it, then citizens got to do it. That's what I think. Do it our way. We'll have to do it our way. But give him to US mothers. That's who want to handle him. Don't give him to the cops. Don't give him to these boys. Give him to US mothers. We want to handle him the way we want to. Mike lauria, the father of Sam's first victim, Donna lauria, is among them. I want to see this guy caught. And I figure if I'm on patrol, one night, I may spot him. I know what goes on in my heart. I know how I feel. How could I say it? I want this guy caught. Dad needed to have his pound of flesh somehow, and I guess he thought if that was how it was gonna be, then maybe he'd get lucky enough to catch him. As far as the police work is concerned, I mean, when you're a family of a victim, you never think that they're doing enough. Homicide detectives unfortunately are left with an impossible situation. The only way random shootings can be apprehended is by the shootings continuing, so it's almost a roulette wheel of fate. Bottom line is, if he stops and goes up to live on the top of a mountain, you'll never get him. He'll get away with everything he's already done, so it's kind of like a catch-22 there. While the city waits with dread for the son of Sam to strike again, in yonkers, the carr family, whose dog has been shot already, experience an escalation in the mysterious attacks against them. Not long after that is when the house was firebombed, or my bedroom was firebombed, more accurately. I think that is the point at which we decided we had to figure this out. And then wheat learns that another local family, the cassaras, have received a similar threatening letter. When the two families meet, the cassaras provide the frightening final piece of the puzzle. Their son brought up the fact that they had had a tenant that had some sort of an issue about a dog, and also a dog in their neighborhood had turned up dead. The publication of the son of Sam's letter to Jimmy breslin suggests who might be tormenting them. Wheat's father is Sam carr, and in his letter, the killer refers to a king of wicker. In yonkers, the carr family lives off wicker street. The letter also mentions a John wheaties, and wheat's brother is called John. Our letters, the breslin letters, and the cassaras' was obviously the same person. The evidence is circumstantial, but wheat manages to convince a handful of yonkers' cops to sit up and take notice. In looking at these three documents, the totality of the three of them together all give important clues. There's a little in each one. When they showed me, they also convinced me. I tried numerous times to contact the task force in queens. The phone number that I had was continuously busy, which frustrated me. People come up with all kinds of wild scenarios about who the shooter is, and if you've got 1,000 reports coming in in a week, most of it is worthless. July 29th will be the son of Sam's first anniversary, exactly a year since he began a terrible rampage that's already left five people dead and six others injured. The police here at the special homicide task force are hoping that the so-called .44 caliber killer doesn't try and celebrate his anniversary in blood. "Tell me, Jim, what will you have for July 29th? You must not forget Donna lauria. Sam's a thirsty lad, and he won't let me stop killing until he gets his fill of blood." That infuriated my father because it was making it sound as though it was someone he knew and that he cared about her. It was almost this level ... you know, he developed this interest in her. The night before the anniversary, Jimmy breslin once again writes to the killer in his newspaper column. Jimmy, in my interpretation of it, he was taunting him, trying to get him to send him another letter. "Is tomorrow night, July 29th, so significant to him that he must go out and find a victim, or will he sit alone and look out his attic window to be thrilled by his power, this power that will have him in the newspapers and on television and in the thoughts and conversations of most of the young people in this city?" July 29, 1977. It's the anniversary of the son of Sam's first murder. And the fear is that he will Mark the day with an attack. But the anniversary passes off without incident. And residents breathe a sigh of relief. Two days later, Bobby violante, a young man from Brooklyn, heads out on his first date with Stacy moskowitz. I was looking very forward to that evening. I'm getting ready to go out, and I'm walking down the stairs from my house, and my mom turned to me, and she says, "now, Robert, just be careful." "Don't worry," I said, "mom, I'm going out with a blonde tonight." Everybody knows the son of Sam's preference for brunettes, so the couple isn't nervous. They're going out in Brooklyn, a borough well outside the killer's territory in the Bronx and queens. Bobby and Stacy go to a movie, then go get a bite at jasmines. From my point of view, the date was going great, also. I mean, we just had a really, really nice time. Now they go to park in this Gravesend bay area where all the kids park. That was the make-out area. So, right over there is the lamppost where I was parked 40 years ago. Police officer Mike cataneo and his partner are also in the area, watching for trouble and writing the occasional parking ticket. It was a beautiful, gorgeous summer night, full moon. And every cop will tell you, "when it's a full moon, be careful. The crazies are out." We always said that. They probably still say it today. That area, I guess because it's so densely populated, very often, there's cars parked on a hydrant for the entire night. That bothered me. I'm not a ticket writer. I never was. But that ... you could cost somebody a life. After ticketing the car, cataneo finds a pair of lovers who are parked in a popular make-out spot. The area's not well lit. It's very quiet, especially at night after midnight. Kids know it's there. We actually chased a couple of kids out of there. And we're going out there and start yelling at them, "are you nuts?! Do you read the paper?!" First thing out of that kid's mouth ... "he didn't come to Brooklyn yet!" We drove away, and off they went. I think it was approximately around, like, 1:00 in the morning. We went to go play on the swings like two little kids. As we were going up to the swings, I see just some guy hanging out at the park house. Didn't pay any mind to him. We just walked by him. And then we were playing on the swings for about 10 minutes, and then she's starting to get a little nervous. She was saying, "Robert, let's go and go back to the car." I said, "okay." As Bobby and Stacy walk back to their car, another couple is parked right in front of them. Tommy zaino is trying to impress his date, Debbie, with his blue corvette. It was a nice car, yes. The ladies loved the car. When I came back into the car, she said, "Robert, let's get going. You know, I feel a little nervous sitting here." And I turned to her, and I said, "all right, stace." I said, "how about we just stay five more minutes, and then we'll go?" What happened next... Really tough to know just exactly what happened. I noticed somebody walking out of the park, and he was walking towards the car behind me. He looked like he was gonna get into the car or talk to somebody in the car. But he pulled something out of his pocket, got into a stance, and started firing into the car. And then, the next thing I know, everything just went blank. I don't think we were three, four minutes, five minutes away. Boom. Shots fired. Go down there, and there's the two kids. I said, "my god." I can't forget that stuff. I never seen anything like that happen. It looked like somebody was making a movie. It didn't look real. Everything was flashing through my head that this could have been the guy. This could have been the son of Sam. I started the car and took off as fast as I could to the police station. I didn't even stop at lights. I must have got there in a couple seconds. I pulled right up to them, and I told them, "I think somebody got shot down near the park." So, then the next thing I did was, I opened the car door. I wrapped my arm around the pole and honked the horn as long as I could till it died out. The four shots went off, and we knew it was shots. It had to be. And I said to my girlfriend, "those were shots." And then this horn started beeping incessantly, and then it stopped, and then it beeped again. And then this man started screaming, "help me, god. Help me." I was yelling out for help, and then I collapsed over the roof of the car. And he was covered with blood. And the girl was covered with blood. It was a horror. Bobby violante has been blinded in the attack. Stacy moskowitz has also been badly wounded. She's rushed to the hospital, but dies the following day. I'll still tell you. I lost something very dear to me. Great kid. But most important are the people, that an animal should snuff away a life of a young girl, blind a young boy, and has killed others and will probably go on killing. An animal like this has to be caught. I was in the hospital for about a month and a half. I was asking for Stacy to see how she was doing, and they hadn't told me for almost a week later that she had passed away. And she had actually passed away only 18 hours after we were brought to the hospital, but they didn't want to tell me right away because, you know, all that I was having to deal with. I gave him the news about his eyes yesterday, and he accepted it like a man. My son Robert is more of a man than I could ever be. It was a comfort to know that she had liked me, and I liked her, and we had a really nice time that night. And the sad part was about knowing, possibly, how many other nice nights we could have had together if things would have worked out, but it was a comfort to know that one night I had shared with her, that it was a really nice night. After the shooting of Robert violante and Stacy moskowitz in Brooklyn, new yorkers are faced with a terrifying reality. The kill zone is no longer limited to the Bronx and queens. "No one is safe." And it wasn't a scare tactic, believe me, because no one was safe. The son of Sam task force has lost many of its best leads. A frantic call to bill Clark quickly eliminates their prime suspect. He's still tailing the man who slipped away the night of the elephas shooting. The night of the Stacy moskowitz shooting, I was sitting outside of his apartment, surveilling him. And I get a call ... "make sure he's in there. If he's in there, then come on down here." 'Cause then he couldn't have done it. So I go up to his apartment door, and when he comes to the door, it was all I could do not to wring his neck. Brooklyn homicide joins the investigation, and the hope is that their local contacts will generate new leads. William gardella is assigned to this latest murder. To me, this was going to be the biggest challenge of my life, having this case. And a new lead is about to break the case open. The son of Sam has made his first mistake. August 1977. The son of Sam has now struck in Brooklyn, extending his killing ground across the whole of New York. Detectives from Brooklyn now join the hunt, leaving no stone unturned. When we were conducting a canvass, questioning people at their doors, we typically would ask, were they out that night? Did they hear the shots? When they heard the shots, what was their response? Did they call 911? Finally, we checked for summonses. A summons places a person, a vehicle, at a specific place and a specific time. Those people are potential witnesses. Joe strano come up with a witness. Her name was Cecilia Davis. I seen a man coming up from down that tree there, and as the dog pulled towards the man, the man come towards me, and he looked me straight in the face. He looked at my dog, and right here, we crossed each other. But she also told detectives, "I saw an officer giving summonses." As parking tickets are filed by hand, it takes police nearly a week to track down the crucial summons. It's the one officer Mike cataneo wrote the night of the murder, just blocks from where Bobby and Stacy were gunned down. One of the summonses was issued to a David berkowitz, 35 pine street, yonkers, New York. What was someone living in yonkers doing there at that moment? This was important to follow up on because the person could have been a witness, could have been the killer, could have been somebody visiting somebody in the area, you know. You don't know. It's a promising lead, so the detectives contact yonkers police about berkowitz. In an amazing coincidence, the dispatcher who takes the call is wheat carr, the woman whose family believes they're being threatened by the son of Sam. This, remarkably, is the same man ... David berkowitz. On the night of August the 9th, I was working 3:00 to 11:00 and answered a call, and I honestly thought, "god. They finally found the pieces of paper Sam gave them, and they're following up on it." And he said, "we're following up on a parking ticket, and we'd like you to make a notification to someone who might be a possible witness." Wheat carr, taking the call, stops the officer and said, "you don't want to speak to this person as a witness. My family has been having trouble with him." This guy was asking me to send two cops to knock on the door of someone I firmly believed to be a serial killer. Wheat carr finally has the full attention of the NYPD. Up to this point, there have been so many false leads. Is this finally the breakthrough they've been looking for? As soon as I walked into the office, sergeant shea says, "we got something going up in yonkers." Bill gardella and a team of detectives is sent up to yonkers to find David berkowitz. He has no idea what to expect. Is he a witness, or is wheat carr right? Could this be the killer? "Please inform all the detectives working on the case that I wish them the best of luck. Think positive, get off your butts, knock on coffins." We're on the block where David berkowitz lives. That's his apartment building over there. Our unmarked police car was parked right about here, right here. There was one car in front of US, and there was a Van similar to this, but higher parked here. And berkowitz's Ford galaxy was, I would say, right about here. The first officer on the scene searches the car and alerts his superiors. In the back is a duffel bag containing guns. In the front, a letter with a message that is all too familiar. It is a note the son of Sam intended to be left at the scene of his next murder. The letter said, "I'm coming out. You can't stop me." And at that moment, we knew this is him. "Bullets crackle in a quiet town. The sounds of running feet and screams of anguish fill the air." At this moment, they have no idea if berkowitz is by himself. It could be a hostage situation. They have no idea if he's armed. The assumption has to be that he will come with a fight or with guns blazing. Two of my detectives, I had them on the rear, watching his fire escape, while we were parked in our unmarked car over here. Four against the potential son of Sam. We should have had more people, but that was not my decision. That was not my decision. We didn't have bulletproof vests at that time. This is what you have. This is what you're going to do. The detectives wait until about 10:00 P.M. When a man finally emerges and heads to the car they're staking out. He's carrying a paper bag shaped in a triangle. He takes that and throws it on the seat next to him. The son of Sam is armed with his .44. He's going hunting. I jumped out of the car, took my gun out, ran down the sidewalk. And his front passenger window was lowered about 6 inches. I came up, put the gun through the window. He had his hand on the ignition key. He had just turned on the ignition, and I screamed at him, "police. Don't you move your hands. Don't you go for a gun. I'll open up on you." I'm cursing, screaming, yelling at him, trying to put the fear of god in him. And what was his response? He kept his hand on the ignition key, and he slowly turns his head like this and smiles. Just smiled. And I've got a gun pointed 2 feet from him. He didn't flinch. He just kept that smile. I ran around. John put him, and he rear-cuffed him. And then he says to ... berkowitz says to the three of US, he says, "well," he said, "you got me. And what took you so long?" This has been the largest manhunt in New York's history, and bill gardella is the first police officer to look upon the face of the son of Sam. When I was standing in the street and that car was pulling away with him in it, it hit me what the impact of what we just did is. I remember standing there and seeing that car leave. And I said, "wow. This is... We've stopped these murders." It was a good feeling. It was a good feeling. Good evening. The most intensive manhunt in New York City's history is over. This is the man police believe to be the son of Sam, the .44 caliber killer, who has killed six and wounded seven in a string of attacks over the last 13 months. He had this peculiar smiling grin that, I think, me and, I think, 20 million other people said, "you know, what is this all about?" I wanted to slap the smirk off his face. I was so angry. It was the Mona Lisa smile, a lot of people would say. David had never been the center of attraction to anyone, and now he was suddenly the center of attention of the world. When I got down to police headquarters, it was so exciting, it was, like, surreal. It was surreal 'cause there he is. There he is. I just had to see myself what he looked like, you know? He looked like he was enjoying it. That's the impression I got. And we let each individual detective that had the case go in and interview him. "And are you the man who shot and killed Donna lauria and wounded Jody valenti?" "Yes, I am." When he was answering the questions that were asked of him, he went into specifics, how he killed. He was stoic. He was like a statue. "I just emptied my gun in the car and saw the glass shatter. And the other girl, I believe she screamed and blew the horn, and I found myself pulling the trigger, and I had already run out of bullets." He was as crazy as a bedbug. His explanation of why he did these things was because a dog told him to do it. "He told me through his dog. It's not really a dog. It looks like a dog." It was almost like, "it wasn't myfault. It was theirfault. I was being ordered to." And he was happy it was over. When the police search berkowitz's apartment to obtain more evidence, they are about to enter the chilling world of a serial killer. The police had finally captured the son of Sam and identified the killer as David berkowitz. He is taken into custody, and a search of his apartment begins. The windows are blacked out. Graffiti is scrawled all over the walls. The place leaves a terrifying impression on those who witness it. Walking into that apartment, I can't explain the feeling. This is where he is. This is where he was. And then, looking into that apartment, looking on the wall. A small hole in the wall and writing around that hole. This is where he talked to Sam. He was commanded by Sam carr's dog through this hole in the wall. The following morning, August the 11th, 1977, new yorkers wake up to the news. Everyone was so happy that this man had finally been found. The exhilaration of that. That was the first thing I heard this morning. It was fantastic. It was great. It made me feel great. It made me feel that they finally caught the son of a gun, and now the city was safe again. Once berkowitz had been finally captured and identified, people still wanted to know more about him. How could he have done this? Why did he do this? And then his bizarre story, the story of the dog. David berkowitz believes that the barking of the dog was how his demonic master delivered his instructions to kill. The press spotlight falls onto the dog's owner, Sam carr. The press was camped out by 10:00 in the morning, wanting to know about, was the dog evil, or did the dog ever talk to them, or weird nonsense like that. We had a whole new set of people calling in threats because they thought that the stories they read in the post meant my father really was telling this guy to go out and commit murders. The nation is fascinated by the son of Sam's bizarre demonic explanation of his killings. Will these delusions also protect him from criminal prosecution? Since his arrest, David berkowitz has been held in the psychiatric wing of kings county hospital under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Schwartz. He has to be examined to ascertain whether or not there is any mental disease or defect that prevents him from understanding the charges against him or assisting in his defense. I spent many hours with him. I heard a very, very involved story. I thought that his description of demonology was delusional thinking. Forgive me if I don't believe in demonology. His explanation involved a very complex series of beliefs. They were logical. They were connected. "All my life, I've been wild, cruel, and destructive. There's no doubt in my mind that a demon has been living in me since birth." The examination of berkowitz provides an in-depth picture of his early life. He was given up for adoption at birth by his mother. His adoptive parents, Pearl and Nate berkowitz, gave him all the love and care they could, but it wasn't easy. David was always a bit strange. He was a loner and, at a certain age, started an interest in girls. The girls tended not to like him. As David grew up, he was unable to fit in. He enlisted in the military. That only made matters worse. He was a very lost, lonely, despondent young man, and he was looking for meaning and purpose in his life. And he began to find something in the form of satanism. The demons that emerge are the justification berkowitz uses to vent his anger at young women. His earlier career was climbing fire escapes and peeking into women changing their clothes. Berkowitz was on a downward spiral. He made one last attempt to reach out and connect with someone. He searches out his real mother, biological mother, tries to kind of become part of that family, but like everything else, even fails at that. Berkowitz was furious when he learned he had been the unwanted result of an extramarital affair, possibly even conceived in the backseat of a parked car. His killing spree began shortly afterwards. But are his demons real or simply an excuse to escape criminal justice? A person cannot be brought to trial, to any proceeding, if the person is not competent. You go to a hospital, and you sit, and that can be an indefinite period. "I am not well, not at all, having dogs talk to me and being controlled by demons." It sounds like he's saying what he thinks he needs to in order to get the courts to cooperate and put him in a hospital as opposed to prison. "I don't want to stay behind the walls forever." Yeah, I bet you don't. "I owe society a chance to make myself good and repay them for all the troubles I caused as a result of my illness." Only Dr. Schwartz has the authority to determine if the son of Sam is fit to stand trial. The nation waits to hear what he will decide. Since the arrest of August 10th, David berkowitz has been held in the psychiatric wing of kings county hospital while the prosecution case is being built against him. The psychiatrist evaluating whether or not he is fit to stand trial is Daniel Schwartz. On August 30, 1977, we submitted our report that he was not fit to proceed. That certainly isn't what the people wanted, and that probably isn't what the court or district attorney wanted. There were questions as to whether or not berkowitz was playing the system and was playing the psychiatrists. The prosecutors do not accept Dr. Schwartz's findings and seek a second opinion. It will be, and is, the position of my office that this defendant is competent to proceed to trial. The state now says to the court, "these psychiatrists are not right, and we're gonna hire still one more." They should have said, "we're gonna hire one more who will see it our way." Public anger is appeased, and the new examination overturns Dr. Schwartz's decision and rules that berkowitz is sane enough to stand trial. But then, in a sudden and dramatic reversal, he pleads guilty to all charges ahead of the trial. He refused to use an insanity defense because he needed the world to understand the danger of the demons that are present, and if he said he was insane, then the warning would not be heeded. As berkowitz has pled guilty to the charges, there can be no trial, and so his next appearance is for sentencing. And on may 22nd, 1978, he is called before the court. The public was riveted, and you had a situation that was almost like a three-ring circus, and berkowitz himself was the ringmaster. This is the last chance for his victims, like Bobby violante, and families of the deceased, like neysa moskowitz, mother of Stacy, to witness justice being done, but things don't go according to plan. The judge ordered to bring the defendant in, and he came in almost like in a prayer mode with his hands clasped over his handcuffs and chanting in a singsong manner, "Stacy is a whore. Stacy is a whore," knowing full well that neysa moskowitz would be there. She had been very vocal in saying that he should get the death penalty, and clearly, David berkowitz didn't like that. It enraged everyone in there, obviously ... reporters, everyone. I really couldn't control myself. Anybody with any heart at all, any emotions, wouldn't have been able to control themselves either, what he said, and I feel very angry that it was even permitted to happen. Berkowitz said he didn't want to be sentenced. He kicked and bit some of five officers trying to move him. Two officers were hurt, but not seriously before berkowitz was finally subdued. It appeared to me that what we were seeing was, the side of the person, perhaps, that had been, you know, present for the murders suddenly is visible on the outside. Berkowitz is sentenced to six consecutive life sentences, a total of 365 years. He is still serving that sentence and has continued to attract public interest for the last 40 years. He has become a born-again Christian. The son of Sam now calls himself the son of hope. He has an online ministry preaching redemption and reaching out to other lost souls. God has given me a whole new life. My testimony has gone into many prisons and jails, giving men and women a hope, you know, that god forgives sins, that he does redeem people, that even if you're in prison, god will not reject you. Everybody in prison finds one god or another, or say they do. Personally, I wish he would have met god rather than be sitting in prison talking about it. I don't believe him, that he found god. I don't believe him. Doesn't make up for all those young women that he killed. It's now 40 years since the son of Sam's reign of terror came to an end, yet he and his crimes remain with US to this day. Many people don't even know the name David berkowitz. But son of Sam? Yeah. Everyone knows son of Sam. It is part of our popular culture. Here we are 40 years later. Parents have died, brothers and sisters have grown up, but they can't outlive the saga. Am I still sad? Yeah. I'm still sad about it. Do I miss her? I miss her immensely. I do. I miss her beyond words. It's a lifetime. It's your entire lifetime. It never goes away. It never gets better. You just find ways to manage it. Everything changed that night. In fact, so much changed that I wasn't even aware of half the changes. There were so many things that I wasn't able to do ... not drive a car ever again, not play sports ever again. I could never forgive him for what he's done. This was a, you know, kind of a horrendous time for all of US, and it leaves an impact. Something you don't forget. Do I want to forget it? I'm not sure. Do I want to put it behind me? I'm not sure. But it is what it is. I feel much safer walking the streets of New York. Everyone was so happy that this man had finally been found. My son Robert is more of a man than I could ever be. He came out of the dark. Talking about their future. They were planning a wedding. She spoke from the heart. A bizarre, sick mind. That name caught fire. It was so exciting, it was, like, surreal. And there's this very pretty young girl. It felt like the world's most dangerous amusement park. "We got to solve this."
