[sighs] [game effects] Oh, fuck. -[shotgun cocks] -[distorted voice] Open the register! I'm not screwing around. Open it! Okay. Okay. Whatever you want. Make it quick! How we looking? -Hurry it up, dipshit! -[whimpering] Thanks, sweetheart. [woman on TV] Coming up after the break, we talk to Mustang's cheerleading captain, Bunny Abbott, about the squad heading to finals. Do I think we can win? Yeah. Hello? This is the best we've ever been. Okay? Okay? The best. Am I right? You're so right.[girls laughing] We are going to take that trophy. Lamewads from Lake Harvest, you're going down. [girls cheering] Good morning, gorgeous.Morning. -What you looking at? -Um-- Nothing. Look, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. You know what I mean? Oh, you're so pretty. You know I never wanna do anything to change that. I know. You know I love you, right? Yeah. I love you too. I get so stressed at work, and when you come home late and you don't answer my texts and you don't tell me where you're going, I have no choice but-- I know. I know. I know how hard you work for me. For us. I'm sorry. I'll do better. I know, baby. And I hate myself when you make me do that to you. But we're good now, right? Sure, baby. And it'll never happen again. I promise. Look at this, my coffee ready to go. Just like you like. Do I have the best wife, or what? Just trying to take away some of that stress. You don't even know the half of it. You remember Jimmy Bauerman? Um... Maybe. Yeah, I think so. Business partner of mine. You met him that one time at the Wilsons'. Oh, sure. We co-own a couple properties together. Of course.I told you this a hundred times! No, right. I know. Anyway, Jimmy calls me ass crack of dawn this morning. Remember that convenience store on Elm Street? Yeah. Well, a couple of assholes decided to rob it this morning. Believe that shit? Wow. That's awful.Yeah. You're goddamn right it's awful. I own a frigging stake in that place. Thirty-five percent. I'm practically a co-owner. Thank Christ, convenience stores are required to take out insurance. Otherwise, I'd be out a few grand. Try not to think about it. You have a big day. Yeah, you're right. Big day for me. Big day for the business. And if all goes well, big day for you and me. Yeah. I'm excited for you. You should be excited for you too, Linds. Pretty soon, we're never gonna have to worry about another thing in our lives. Good luck, baby. Your husband doesn't need any luck. You just count your lucky stars that you married a winner. [deep exhale] [police radio chatter] You got anything?I got a burnt-out car. Hey, man, how come I always get the shit work and you get to stand around, look handsome all day? Shh! It's fucking Broza, all right? He's the one in charge. Hey, boss.What? Stop whining, all right? Finlay, it's called seniority. Okay, idiot? Yeah, well, a little help would be nice. Too goddamn bad. Shut up, all right? I don't wanna hear it. What do you got, Mack?All right, car's a rental. Based on the license plate-- or what was of it-- and the testimony from the clerk this morning, it was definitely used in this morning's robbery. It was checked out under a fake ID. Kids notice any recognizable features or anything? Negative.Why here? And the security footage sucked as well. Basically, we got two perps. Both dressed in all black, wearing vests and masks. Oh, and I quote-- check this one out-- "They looked like creepy fucking skeletons." Skeletons? Really? That's original.Yeah. They were using voice changers too.What? Yeah. They sounded like men but mechanical, so it could be anyone. Look, these guys definitely wanted to get away. They wanted to cover their tracks. They burned the car, okay? It's a step up in the criminal masterminds that live in this shit hole I work in. Hey, you chose to move here.I did, didn't I? Oh, God, this is terrible. What do you got? Oh, no. What?Back seat. I got a case. Bag full of cash. Or it looks like-- looks like one. [Mack] Oh, shit.Looks like a fair amount. Mack, wanna steal it and go to Vegas and get married? We can go retire. Get the lab down here, okay? The car is ruined. You're not gonna find any DNA or prints on this shit. Have them focus on the cash. They knocked over the convenience store and then they forgot the cash in the back? These guys, they're either exceptionally stupid or exceptionally smart, I'm not sure. You think we can pull a print off of it? Look at that. He's a cop now. Yeah, maybe. You never know, you might get a partial. You gotta take what you can get. I gotta go. [Broza] Mack! Aw, shit. What did I miss? What is that? -[Mack] The Belly Room. -Hey, this is something. I'm gonna go check this out, okay? I'll see you. -Don't let Finlay fuck anything up. -Thanks, Broze. [door closes, engine starts] [car departs] [patrons chattering, whistling] I'm Detective Broza. [woman] Hi. What can I do for you, Detective? How many people do you know that have one of these? [laughs] Oh, geez. Dancers, bartenders, bar backs, manager. Cleaning staff has some. Regular customers, if they're in polite company. So, everybody has them? Yeah. There's a huge stack next to the door. You can take some yourself if you want. Thank you. I'm good. Thanks. Okay. Okay, well, my name's Maggie. Are you sure I can't get you anything? Yeah, no. I'll have a club soda, Maggie. Yeah, club soda. All right. Coming right up. Maggie, you haven't seen anything out of the ordinary coming through here lately? Other than the normals, you mean? Yeah. You know, somebody you haven't seen before? Faces, and I don't know, suspicious types? Guys at night? Something like that? I don't work nights, but-- You know what? Let me get someone for you. Hey, Lizzie! Can you get Nicole? She's got a visitor. Sure thing. You're new to the force, aren't you? A lot of cops come in here? You could say it's a small town. Could say, and you'd be right. [Maggie] Aha. Here she is. If anyone knows anything, it's Nicole. I hear someone's looking for me. Yeah. I mean-- [clears throat] Pardon me. I'm looking for somebody that might be able to help me. Well, I'd love to help you if I can, Officer... Detective. Detective Broza. Nice to meet you, Detective. I'm Nicole. Nicole, sure. So, any new faces coming through here? Any strange characters come through the club lately? Why? What's up? The convenience store robbery. You hear about it? This morning? It's my case, and-- So I'm poking my nose around and... You heard about it though, right? Of course I heard about it. Everyone's been talking about it. It's the most excitement this town's seen in who knows when. Do you think the guys who did it might have been in here? I can't be clear about that. I thought maybe you've seen something out of the ordinary, maybe you could help me. I don't know. Let me think. Um... I think there were a couple guys in here a few nights ago. Really?Friday. Friday night? Around 11:00. Couple of guys, medium build. They might have been military 'cause they had that attitude, you know? You've never seen them before?Nope. We get a lot of strangers just passing through town. Strip clubs are a popular place for lowlifes. Must feel great to feel so good about your clientele, huh? Oh, hey, I love lowlifes. I mean, I'm one of them. I doubt it. Anyway... So, these gentlemen, these guys, did you catch anything? Like they drop a name? Anything like that? No, sorry. They both had short, dark hair. I didn't notice any scars or tattoos or anything. You look for that sort of stuff, right? Sorry. That probably doesn't help much. No, hey, it was great. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Oh. Security cameras. Any security cameras in here, out there? No. The owner's a cheapskate. We keep telling him to put them in, but he just doesn't. Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt your day-- I actually just finished my shift. I could use a lift home. Excuse me? I could use a lift home if it's not putting you out. No. I'll drive you home. Yeah?I'll drive you home. Great. Sure.Okay. Actually, could you drop me off at my friend's? I need to help her with some housework. Is that okay? Absolutely. I'll be right here. Thanks. I'm gonna go grab my stuff. Bye. [PA: exotic dance music] Hey. Nice house your friend's got. Yeah. I guess so. She's-- She's done pretty well for herself. Oh, yeah? What's she do? She's married to a rich guy. [laughs] That makes sense. So how long you known her? A long time. You know, you can turn the detective thing off every once in a while. I never turn the detective thing off. Maybe I can help you with that. You free tonight? What, you asking me out this time? You got a rule against girls asking guys out? No. Good. Okay, here. My personal cell. You know, call me anytime. I will. Thanks for the ride. Uh-huh. Hey, Linds. Who the hell was that? Nice to see you too. Who was that, Nicole? I have never seen that guy before. He's just some cop. Relax. A cop? You brought a cop to my house? Relax. He's clueless. I just needed a ride from the club. Well, get one from someone else. Or at least give me a heads-up first. I mean, we're dealing with some pretty sensitive stuff. Right, boss. It'll never happen again. I just-- [sighs] I just-- I don't know where your head's at sometimes. You wanna know where my head is at? 1.8 million. God, I love this stuff. Yeah, you love the flashy stuff. Makes a lot of noise. Sounds like you. Yep, that's me. All style, no substance. You know me so well. Bang. You're dead. That's loaded, you idiot. Yeah, Lindsay. I know. I loaded it. Have you been practicing what I showed you? Yeah. Show me. [scoffs] You're getting there. Just keep practicing. It'll become natural. I still don't know how you got into all this stuff. You got real-world problems, you pick up a thing or two along the way. All part of knowing how to take care of yourself when you need to. Hey. That asshole hit you again? Yeah. Son of a bitch is going down for what he's done. You okay? Yeah. Hey. You did good this morning. What you did, what we did-- that was the first step in the right direction. I know. We just have to stick to the plan, right? A couple more days and we are out of here. Just a few more days, yeah. Just one more little job and one big one, and then we're free. [long exhale]Don't be nervous. If he finds out-- If he catches us-- He won't. Not until it's too late anyway. Your prick husband's going down for what he's done. Promise? Cross my heart and hope to die. And then me and you... we're gonna leave this town rich, with his money. Just the two of us. We deserve this.You're goddamn right we do. Revenge is gonna feel good. [door bangs] Hey, Broze. Hope we're not interrupting. No. Just trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. Anything new? Well, reviewed that footage again of the surveillance camera. One, the footage is fucking terrible.Okay. But the second thing is, one of the perps is definitely a lot taller than the other one. So, Mickey came up with this idea-- Tall guy with a short guy.Yeah, and he wants to share it. You remember that thing in DC a few years ago with the sniper who brainwashed his son? Yeah. The DC Snipers-- two black guys. Older black gentleman and a kid. I mean, worst-case scenario, if we have something similar, we got somebody driving the bus and somebody who's willing to do whatever he asks. One more thing. We got the lab results on the money. Yeah? Came up negative.That figures. So that's what we got. What do you got? I don't know. I don't know what I got. I don't even know what I'm thinking. I stopped by the... [stammering, snapping fingers] Belly-- The Belly... -[Mack] The Belly Room? -Belly Room. Yeah. I know the name. The Belly Room. I talked to the bartender. Maggie.Yeah. And I also talked to some stripper named Nicole. She saw a couple guys come through town the other day. Possibly military. Caught her eye. Few days ago. [Mack] Is there anything we can work off of? I don't know. I'm gonna go back and talk to that stripper again. Maybe-- I'll do it tonight and get some more details. What? Watch yourself. I don't want the boys thinking you're dating strippers. Did you come in here to tell me that you have a dwarf and a giant on camera? And really nothing new and not to date strippers? Is that why you came by here? I came here 'cause I like the pie. Oh. Okay.Here's why I came here. Go ahead. You know a guy named Seth Walters?No. Doesn't ring a bell. He's kind of our resident lowlife. Seth Walters. Resident lowlife.A real swarmy son of a bitch. He's got a fucked-up haircut with a ponytail out the back. He does?Yeah, he does. I wanna go see him. He's got his fingers in a lot of semi quasi-legal shit. We don't give him a hard time because basically he keeps his nose clean. Walters?Walters. Okay. But the reason I bring him up is because he's been flapping his gums all over town about some large shipment he's got coming in on Saturday. I don't know where it's gonna be.Large shipment of what? Yeah. And it's something that we don't really need to be concerned about because he's got his own private security and all that shit. But the fact is, he's been flapping his gums about this. And the way he's been flapping them, it's something that we should be aware of. That's good. That's something, Mack. You know, that's good. I'm gonna check him out. We're not used to large sums of cash coming through Cromwell. Yeah. So if someone was gonna jump him, this would be the week. Correct. Okay. You're not hoping for something to go south, right? Of course not. I've been through this stuff before. I mean hostages, murder, domestic abuse. We don't want to have anything to do with it, trust me. [cell phone buzzing]Hang on. I got to go. All right, I'll talk to you guys. Okay.Way to go. Thanks. How do you think it went over? [deep exhale] Just keep digging. [patrons cheering, whistling] [PA: rock] [cell phone buzzes] [door opens] Hey, gorgeous.Hey. I got us some coffee. All right. Well, set those down and get over here. Caffeine can wait. What you been doing? Nothing. Just basking in the afterglow of an amazing night. I should be thanking you. Let's quit our jobs and run away together. Okay.[giggles] You gonna be my sugar mama?Maybe. Yeah?Yeah. You make that kind of money at the club? I'm in. I'm gonna retire right now. Maybe I'll rob someone. But then I guess you'd have to arrest me. Yeah. I mean, if you rob someone or stab someone or stole a car. But you're not some crazy asshole. So I don't have to worry about that, right?Yeah. Lucky you. Really lucky me.[laughs] You know my friend Lindsay? You dropped me off at her house yesterday. Oh, yeah. Yeah. What about her? We've known each other a real long time. Best friends. Always looking out for each another. Everybody needs a friend like that. That's good. I don't know about that. I think maybe I'm just starting to realize that no matter how much someone says they're trying to help you, they're really just trying to help themselves. You're so pretty. Oh. [stammers] How do you mean? [laughs] She treats me like I'm an idiot. Really?Yeah. And I've recently realized it's not a new thing. She always has. She says she needs me in her life, but I think she just needs me around to make herself feel better, to see that there's someone who has it worse than her. Really?Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't let people take advantage of me, no matter who they are. No, you shouldn't. You're right. You think so?Yeah. You shouldn't let anybody take advantage of you. From what I'm seeing, you're smart, you're strong. You're obviously, you know, very beautiful. And if she wants to look down on you, well, fuck that bitch. Fuck her. Screw her. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it. I don't know how much help that was, but really... You're perfect. You're perfect. Perfect?Mm-hmm. Nobody's ever called me perfect. But coming from you, I'm gonna take it. [whispering] I gotta go. Okay. I'll call you later. Okay.Okay. All right, this is it. Game seven, baby. You take this down, you make this happen... couple days, you and me are on the fucking gravy train. I'll bring the fucking cheddar home. That's what I like to see. You look fucking beautiful, you know that? Look at this. All right. Later, Ricky. Later. [magazine clicking] Where the hell have you been? I texted you hours ago. You sound like my mother. Well, sometimes I feel like I am. Been practicing? Yeah.Good. 'Cause we got a big night tonight. So we're really doing another one. We are. And you're gonna like it. You know those poker games Seth's friend Cisco holds every week? You've gotta be kidding me. Cisco's crazy. What if one of his friends or he recognizes us? They won't. We're careful. Plus, people see what they want to see. Bluff. [man] He's right.I got two pair. I got three kings. Hands off. Just fuck off, Mikey. [distorted voice] Okay, assholes! Everybody get your hands in the air now! What the fuck is this? It's a fucking holdup! Keep your hands up and nobody gets hurt! You know what I see? Two fucking dead men. Two fucking dead men. Shut up! Partner, show this prick who we are! My partner told you to shut the fuck up! Anybody else wanna cause any trouble? Huh? Huh? Get the bag. Fill it up, dick. Hey, you! Make it fast. Come on! Faster! [normal voice] Don't you move. Fucking broads? -Fuck! -You're fucking dead! [Nicole] Shoot him! -[Cisco grunting] -[Lindsay groaning] Let's go. -[engine revving] -[Nicole laughing] That was so intense. Oh, my God. Holy shit. I can't believe you shot him. He was going to kill you, Lindsay. Sometimes, to get what you want, you have to do bad things. [chattering] [police radio chatter] I agree. It's gotta be the same two that did the convenience store. Maybe so, huh? Let's see what this jerk has to say. [Mack] Hey, guys.[Broza] Hey! [Broza] How's it going on over here? "How's it going on?" How the fuck do you think it's going on, motherfucker?Not so good. Stop whining. Okay, asshole? I'm not the one running an illegal poker game in the back of some shit hole like this. You are. Okay? Broze, he said that the perps were wearing voice changers. That's the same as the convenience store. [Broza] What's that about? Sounded like dudes. All of a sudden, one broke. And? It's fucking broads, all right? A bitch shot me. Fucking happy? I gotta live with that. You fucking clowns.[all laughing] Two women did this to you?Fucking speak English? Yeah, motherfucker. Let him bleed to death. Button it up here first and then see if you can get any more out of our friend. I'm gonna go talk to that resident asshole, Walters. I'll meet you at the diner.All right. We'll compare notes there. So what else you got, tree trunk? Suck my fat fucking dick. How about that, pumpkin? Just as planned. Total wasteland. Told you it'd be good to case it one last time. Yeah. It's good. So, I'll drop you off and we'll meet up later? Yeah. Wait up. Excuse me! Excuse me. Mr. Walters? Yeah. What can I do for you, Detective? I hear you're getting a little shipment in here tomorrow. I just wanted to make sure you got all your bases covered. I would hate for something to go awry in our little community here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we sure do, Detective... Broza.Oh, you're Broza! Yeah.Yeah, yeah. A couple of my buddies at the department told me about you. You transferred here from New York City, right?That's right. Yeah, well, I surely do appreciate your concern, Detective Broza, but I got an entire truck full of armed guards coming in to assist tomorrow. Private firm, ex-military. I'm told they're the very best. But you know what? If I need some over-the-hill cops, I'll be sure to give you guys a call. Happy to hear that. We'll be here if you need us. Hey! You want some advice there, Walters? Next time you're getting a shipment of this size... don't go spouting your mouth like that. You'll attract unwanted attention, especially considering some of your known associates are having a bad week. Actually, I got two of my boys over at the mini mall on Third Street right now. Your buddy Cisco and three other friends ended up on the wrong side of an illegal poker game last night. Now, be careful. You don't know when that stuff could become contagious. You have a nice day now. Stay warm. You jack-off. What's he doing here? Don't freak out, okay? It's just a coincidence. How do you know? Because Broza hasn't said a word about the warehouse or Seth or the shipment to me. Believe me. If he knew, I'd know. Hey, hey. What's going on? [groans] Glad you could join us. Yeah, she got tired, you know?Spare me. Had to give her a break. Everybody gets tired. [Broza] Anything new? [Mack] Cisco's told us all he can tell us. I went to the MMA spot and the karate joint like you said. And the shooting range. There's no female members there. Basically, we're looking for two women that don't exist. Coffee's good. Thanks. What about the money? [Mack] It's the same MO. Found a rental car off of Rose in a parking garage. The money was in the back seat. This time, they didn't torch it. I sent it in for prints. We're not gonna get anything there.I don't get it. These two girls are just trying to piss off the local heavies or something? What's the MO?It seems that way. I mean, we got no prints.[Finlay] We got nothing. How'd it go with Walters? Oh. A complete douche bag. Just like you said, you know. He says he's got everything covered. Fingers crossed he does. Otherwise, he's in for a world of hurt. And I wouldn't mind if he got some really. -He's a real prick. -[Broza] Real sweet. [Nicole] So he doesn't know anything? [Lindsay] No. Not much. Just that they're looking for women. Then we're good. It could be anyone. I think so. I think we're covered. Good. Then 4:00 a.m.? I told Seth I'm going to an early-morning spin class. You know what he told me? "Good. You could stand to lose a few." [scoffs] God. What a prick. You don't think that cop--I'll check with him tonight, okay? If anything tips me off, I'll let you know. You need to trust me. I do. Good. Then I'll see you tomorrow morning. [PA: soul funk] [man singing, indistinct] [patrons cheering, whooping] [gasps] Oh![both laughing] Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I just wondered what you were doing later. Just wanted to see if you were maybe free tonight. I'd love to do something, but I have to get up early. So, can I take a rain check? Sure. You can't help-- No problem.You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just the robbery, I can't get it off my mind. The robbery? Anything new? No. Oh, yeah. You know, it's women. Women?Yeah. Do you know who? That's the question that needs answering. They always slip up, you know. They always do. -So, be careful, okay, honey? -Okay. See you soon.Okay, bye. Still a few minutes until the delivery arrives. [deep breath] You've gotta be kidding me. [woman] Twenty minutes! If you're not back on the bus, you're getting left behind. No excuses. So there's some kids. So what? It's just one little wrinkle. There's been a couple, but the plan is still good. You said so yourself. You know, if I didn't know you, I'd tell you to turn the car around and scrap the entire thing. But? But we're never gonna have another chance at 1.8 million. So this is it. [exhales] Now you're talking. Here we go. We move after the money's delivered and they leave. [no audible dialogue] Look at these pricks. I bet they make a pretty penny just to show up and act tough. Guys like these, they're all the same. Overcompensating, all of them. Yeah, what about you? I'm very comfortable with what I've got in my pants. I just like to shoot stuff. Here we go. Could you hurry it up, please? Everything you do is slow. You walk slow, you talk slow. You're always late. Count the money, please. We should've gotten a safe like I said. Would've been a hell of a lot easier. Oh, yeah? You think we should've got a safe? Yeah.Yeah? I think you should shut the fuck up and count the fucking money! Please. Where did you find this guy? I gotta relax. I gotta relax. I gotta relax. What's up, beautiful? I know you'll get me all calmed down. You playing solitaire again? All right, what did I teach you? You're gonna put the ace up, right? Then the two. [brakes squeal] [woman] Seth, the cameras are down. [man] Power outage or something? Gee, you think, dipshit? Well, fix it! Babe, you got a flashlight? No.What the fuck? [amplified voice] I wanna see hands in the air now! -Seth, that's-- -I said get your hands up! All right, what the fuck's going on? We're robbing you, Einstein! Now get your damn hands in the air! Nah, fuck that. Rocco, Declan. Get out your guns! Slide them over. Drop the phone! Hands behind your head! Tie them up. Don't do anything stupid and you might live. [groans] [Nicole] Don't bother with this one. I got him covered. How we looking? Good. Cover the door. You got some balls, you know that? Coming into my place of business, waving guns, wearing masks, taking hostages. Stealing my fucking money! This is armed robbery, bitch, and nobody ever gets away. What is that? What are you doing? Put the phone down, you stupid prick! [grunts] What the hell? He called the cops, Lindsay. Lindsay? Oh, my God. Lindsay, I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you. You know, when I hit you, I should've fucking buried you! [Lindsay whimpering] [claps hands] Come on, girls. Let's go. Let's go. [gunshot] [shrieking]Get in! Get in the bus! Get in the bus! That's right. I forgot we're cops. We're broke. [female dispatcher] Unit 5. Unit 5. Oh, God. This is 5, go ahead. Please respond. 2-11 in progress, Cedar Street. -That's Walters. Let's go. -[Finlay] This is 5. We got Broza with us. We're on our way. Over and out. [whimpering] Damn. You shot him. He had it coming. You said nobody gets hurt unless absolutely necessary. Are you telling me you're not happy he's dead? Then let me go. Grab a bag, and let's get out of here. Hey! Hey! They're coming! Let's go! Bunny! Ashley! Yeah, Coach. Be right there. Just finishing a text. [sirens wailing] Oh, my God. -Fuckin'-A. -Goddamn it. Drop your weapons now! A nightmare. Drop your weapons now! Get in the car. I'll cover us.Bunny! [Nicole] Get to your bus. Now.[girls yelping] You're not gonna shoot me while I'm behind a cheerleader. Besides, I think I have you boys outgunned. [gunfire] [yelping]Stay in the passenger seat and don't move. Dispatch, this is Unit 5. Shots fired. We need backup. Send everyone. I mean everyone! Send them now! [muttering] God! There's no endgame here, ladies! Just give it up! Come on, give it up! [tires screeching] [Broza] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! [siren wailing] [sirens wailing] [engines revving] What the hell is that? Holy shit! [sirens stop][fire roaring] Aw, shit. Finlay, you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right.Mack. You sure? We're fine. Get after them. You're gonna lose them. Go! I'm gone. You're gonna lose them![Finlay] Go, Broze. [siren wails] There. Pull around back. [panting] There'll be time to rest later. Come on, we're on a schedule. Let's go. [Lindsay] You know this place? You work in a seedy business, you get to know some seedy places. Is it okay if I go now? Yeah, Bunny. You can go. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much. I guess you better start walking. If you head that way, you'll hit a gas station in about three, four miles. Hey, Bunny. We're gonna need that phone. Come on. -My phone? -Can't have you making any calls. No. No, I promise. I won't call anybody, I swear to God. Jesus Christ. It's just a phone. All of my pictures. My text messages. Here. I'll trade you. This cash for that phone. That way, you can buy as many phones as you want. Thanks, lady. Now get out of here. What the hell is wrong with this generation? Ready? See anything? Ghost town. We still got time to make our bus? Sure. -What the hell are you doing? -I'm breaking free, boss lady. This time, I'm the one that gets the happy ending, the white-picket fence. -Nicole... -Save it. Get on the floor face first. Why are you doing this? Because half the money isn't anywhere near as enticing as all of it. Because I'm tired, boss lady. Tired of you always getting your way. Always looking down on me from your pedestal, thinking I'm an idiot. We can talk about this. We just don't have a lot of time here. Look, you're not gonna hurt me. Stop telling me what I'm going to do! It's my turn. Now get on the floor so I can eighty-six you and leave with my money. No. [gunshots, muffled] Why don't you make this easy and come out from behind there? I don't think so. Linds, you dead yet? No, not yet! [gunshots] [hammer clicking] Put the gun down, or I will kill you. Nah. You're gonna have to shoot me. [hammer clicks][gasps] I loaded the guns, you idiot. Does it piss you off knowing that we did all this hard work and I'm getting away with the payday? It probably does. Smart people always get angry when things don't go exactly the way they wanted. Time to say good-bye, Linds. [both grunting] [gunshots, muffled] Goddamn it. It didn't have to be this way. It was always going to be one or the other of us. You were too preoccupied by getting out of your life that you failed to see this coming. Everything I did-- we did-- we did it for us. For you and me. No. We were doing it for you. I just happened to see this in a different light, a way for me to finally get what I want. That's not true. Who are you kidding? You-- All these years, you were always on top. You were always getting everything you wanted. I was actually relieved when you told me Seth was a wife beater. Made me feel not so bad. Almost put us on the same level. You can't shoot me. You don't have the guts to do it. Even after I steal your money, shoot at you, kill your husband... you can't do it. You're just weak. I am not weak. Then do it. Pull the trigger. Police! Freeze! [gunshot] No. No. Nicole. You did this? You're not as dumb as I thought you were. What about me and you? Me and you. No me and you. No me and you? What are you talking about? Just hang on. I'll-- Nicole, hey. Shh. Don't-- Don't die. Come on. Nicole! [muffled groan] [gunshot] Dispatch, Broza. Two perps. One's down. The other on foot. The warehouse complex on Old Road. [clattering, footsteps] Dispatch, Broza. I lost the suspect. Heading back to my car. Son of a bitch. I'll be a son of a bitch. Sir. Yeah, I've got a ticket for the Blue Line.Ah, yes. Unfortunately, this bus has been delayed about five or ten minutes. Just go ahead and have a seat over there, and we'll let you know as soon as we're ready to board. Okay. Thanks. [water running] [crying] [water off] [sniffles] [sighs] Hey. Sit down. I got a gun on you. Sit your ass down. So what now? You gonna arrest me? Yeah. But not right now in front of these people. I don't want to make a scene. Okay? But you move, I'm gonna kill you. Whose idea was it anyway? Yours? Nicole's? Whose? It was both of us. Seth Walters, he was my husband. Yeah? Is he dead? Yeah.That's good. Nicole killed him.Oh, bullshit. Nicole wouldn't kill anybody. She tried to kill me. If it helps, he had it coming. So why'd you risk it? Why'd you do it? You were a well-taken-care-of wife. For some money? I wasn't well taken care of. He beat me. Me and her, we were finally gonna get out of this town. It's cursed, you know, this town. Makes people bitter, angry. Like you? Like me. Like Nicole, I guess. She was your friend, though. Huh, Lindsay? It was supposed to be perfect. Everything she told me was a lie. Yeah, me too. Loved her though, didn't you?Didn't you? You were gonna steal the money and run away together, right? Just the two of us. Start new lives. And now she's dead.And now she's dead. And I killed her. I almost made it, didn't I? [man on PA] Blue Line now boarding. Gate 15. All passengers. Blue Line now boarding. Gate 15. All passengers. You did. Hey, Lindsay, listen to me. Leave that bag, get your ass up and go get on that bus before I change my mind. What?Lindsay, go. Get out of here. You're free. Go.
