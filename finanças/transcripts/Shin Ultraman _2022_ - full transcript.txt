Behavioral principle unknown. Analyzing with Kaiju Behavior Simulation D1. Evacuation route is undeveloped. Evacuation Simulation D2 is being executed with civilians prioritized. SSSP has arrived at forward HQ! The DPA Minister has designated the target as S-Class Species No. 7. Notice from the DPA. D1 still under consideration. Hello again. I'm the SSSP Captain, Tamura. We are assuming command as of this moment. Your cooperation is appreciated. Yes sir. Let's skip the formal handover. The target is invisible, but can be detected through surrounding debris. And it shows up clearly on infrared. Then isn't invisibility pointless? Lasers go through it. Light transmittance is almost 100%. It can make its cells have 0% reflection and absorption. Heat and light weapons won't work. If it's a bioweapon, it's for use against a more advanced civilization. Target stopped near Yoshiwa substation! Why an electric substation? Wait... is it eating electricity?! Change in Kaiju No. 7's visibility! It seems to show itself when it's full. The invisibility's even more pointless! After charging, it reveals itself to intimidate. It makes sense. If it eats electricity, we should shut off its supply. Contact the Ministry of Economy and the power company! Get it shut off! When the power stops, it attacks the power grid. What a nuisance. Notice from the DPA. S-Class Species No. 7 has been named. Target is hereby known as Invisible Kaiju Neronga. Any reason behind that? The DPA Minister names them on impulse. Fascinating. How does it sense where there's electricity? Maybe it has a quantum device that detects the coordination of electric fields? Neronga is heading towards Mt. Uji. Blackout areas expanding. Begin a reconnaissance-in-force and attack before it causes even more damage. At this speed, GPS-guided missiles can't miss. No radiation detected throughout. A saturation attack is possible. Targeting the electrical horns on its head seems most effective. Roger that. Forget the armor units. Focus fire on Neronga's head. Target has shot down all missiles! No hits! Unbelievable! An anti-surface discharge?! I think we just made it mad. Behavior Simulation D1 results are in. Left alone, Neronga will likely consume all of Japan's electricity and discharge it all over Japan. What a pain... The Ministry of Economy and Prime Minister's Office won't like this. It's Chief Munakata. What's the situation? There's been a setback. I see. The Secretary-General's suggesting nuclear attack to the DPA Minister. It's probably an excuse to lead us to possessing nukes, but you never know. It may only be for counter-Kaiju use, but this is what happens when they ratify an international nuclear licensing treaty. For some reason, Kaiju only appear in Japan. The international community wants Japan to foot the bill. Do you think our politicians can fight that pressure? I understand our situation. We'll try to resolve this before the P5 do anything. That's the situation. We need a viable option. Any ideas besides an attack by the ground forces or cutting power? Fire a highly conductive material into Neronga to cause electric leakage. Or use water to short it out. That could work, but its hide is highly insulated and tough. Even an SDF excavator won't pierce it. It won't just let us punch a hole in it and no tranquilizer has worked on a Kaiju. How about a long-term strategy? We can keep cutting off power and try to starve it to death. It could take forever, and this is the Chief Cabinet Secretary's electoral zone. The Prime Minister's Office won't accept any more damage. I guess so. In that case, I'm out of options. Same here. I have no idea. Captain, a child's still in the village. I'll handle this right away. All right. I'm counting on you. Anything! No one has any swift and sure-fire ideas?! Object incoming from outside the atmosphere. Speed, 12,000 kmph. Unknown object is slowing! Heading this way! What happened?! Status report! Incoming object has crashed nearby! No, it's a landing! The object is moving! A new flying Kaiju?! No... Its silhouette is humanoid! What is this thing?! A... silver giant? Whoa. That's 500,000 kilowatts of power! It can stand that?! It turned invisible again! Does it sense danger? Is the giant going to do something? What is it doing? High energy readings inside the giant! I don't know what's going on! Status report! What happened?! I don't know! It's a light wave heat beam! High ion readings! The air's turned into plasma! How many gigajoules of heat was that?! Whatever it is, that giant is incredible. -It flies?! -What?! That's impossible! Contact the radar sites! Don't lose it! Mt. Mineoka station. Target lost. Mt. Otakine station lost it, too. It disappeared in mid-air? Where did it go? See the Kaiju? Yeah I did! Did you see it turn invisible? I hope one doesn't appear in Tokyo. Why not? Kaiju are so amazing! They're so cool! I'm worried. Kaiju are like earthquakes to us Japanese. When they hit, they hit. The newspapers were all sold out. One shows up in the countryside and the media goes crazy. There wasn't much damage yesterday. Yeah. Our efforts are finally showing results. So the ground force's Steel Rain finally worked on a Kaiju. I hear a giant from the sky took it out. Seriously? Thanks to the widespread evacuation, no civilian witnesses have been reported. Transferring from the Public Security Intelligence Agency to the SSSP. I'm Hiroko Asami. I'm the Captain, Tamura. Our team has been assigned to deal with the mysterious giant. That'll be your job. I still can't believe it. Is this giant humanoid a new Kaiju? We don't know. It's why we asked for an analyst like you. Understood. I'll do my best to meet expectations. I sensed in the giant an intelligence different from that of Kaiju. It's just a personal impression. Initial impressions are important. I'll keep that in mind. Welcome to the government's independent young bloods. I'm Funaberi. Yumi Funaberi. I'm from the MEXT. My specialty is biology. And you're also married. Captain Kimio Tamura is from the Ministry of Defense. He's from the Bureau of Defense Policy. Akihisa Taki. Here from Johoku University where he works in unparticle physics. A typical geek who brings his personal life to work. You really were in intelligence. You already know all about us. And that's my new buddy, Shinji Kaminaga. From Public Security, the National Police Agency Security Bureau. That's all I know. He strives for anonymity. He says little and works alone. I don't know him well. In the last incident, he and a child were in the vicinity of the giant's landing. He didn't have a scratch. He's amazingly lucky. So he was the closest to the giant. I'm Asami. It's a pleasure. I'm Kaminaga. By "buddy," do you mean "partner"? I guess so. I've only worked in teams or alone. This is my first duo. I see. I suppose we're paired up because of our similar background. But being buddies is about trust. Hopefully you can earn my trust. Where's your report on the giant? It's not in my file. There was nothing to report. I was unconscious. Already you're a useless buddy. What do I call the people here? They're SSSP members, just like you. No, I mean in terms of human conceptual thought. They're our teammates. Our friends. How's the rookie? Outstanding. She's quick to adapt and has good judgement. She works fast, too. Fast indeed. IDENTITY UNKNOWN And concise. ULTRAMAN (TENTATIVE NAME) INVESTIGATIVE REPORT "Ultra"? It's code for top secret matters. It was used in her training. "Ultraman." I like it. Though he is causing headaches. Information from NORAD and Yokota Base has reached the White House. The US is becoming more interested. When it was Kaiju, all they would do was sell us weapons. When it's an extraterrestrial, they get involved. And now others are getting involved. Being a dominant country must be fun. So why do I have to write up a report just to hand over to the US? Because the Chief told you to. They should get the information themselves and not rely on a vassal state like us. What information? He's 60 meters tall and, based on ground impressions, 2,900 tons. We know nothing about his beam, how he flies, or his purpose. We don't even know if he's naked or clothed. There's really nothing to go on. You're not very considerate. You could at least ask if I want a coffee or just give me one. We are self-sustained, individual organisms. We act on our own for ourselves. Society is more than just individuals. Your coffee, your clothes... They are all made by someone else. Humans are social animals. We depend on each other to survive. I see. So, a herd. This guy is an imbecile. Look out! It's crumbling! Avalanche! Get away from the bridge! Get away! Quickly! A Kaiju has appeared in the Momoyama District of Kamikita City. A chopper will be here in ten minutes. Everyone, move out! Yes sir! Okay. My first mission! Out in the mountains again? I hate bugs! Oh come on. Show some spirit! Earthquake detection system locating the target. We'll classify it as a Subterranean Kaiju. A Subterranean Kaiju... I have a bad feeling. Civilian evacuation of target area will be complete in 20 minutes. Kaiju No. 8 is digging through the mountain moving in a straight line. Maybe we could use the tunnel it digs for an expressway tunnel. Not for a while we can't. We're getting radioactive readings in its wake... Yes. There are many similarities to the Radiation-Eating Kaiju Pagos. You're right. It's heading directly towards a nuclear waste storage facility. CONTROLLED AREA (STORAGE FACILITY) NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY It is! Make sure everyone gets protective gear on just in case. Asami, focus on radiation surveillance. Roger. New seismic readings detected. Target moving from Delta 6 to Echo 5. Bingo. A 99% chance it's the same type of Kaiju as Pagos. This is really bad. I'll assume it's a Case B and report it to the Chief. This is really bad. Yes. Not only does it have radioactive materials inside it, but, like Pagos, it may fire some kind of nasty beam. We definitely want to avoid radioactive materials scattering again like with Pagos. I'm initiating Case B in accordance with the S-Class Species Suppression Protocol. I'll handle the higher-ups. You handle the situation there. Roger that. The Chief will have the DPA declare a State of Emergency B. Order a mandatory wide-range evacuation. Roger that. I'll check the local monitoring system as a fail-safe. And we now have a name for it. The Subterranean Kaiju Gabora. With Gabora underground, now might be our chance. Right. If we kill it underground, there's less chance of radioactive contamination. Yeah. An MOP2 can reach this depth. All right. We'll purchase Massive Ordnance Penetrators from the US right away. Get me the Prime Minster. -Get a status report. -Send target location! -Kaiju No. 8 causing road collapses. -Cannot see target! The explosions are masking its seismic waves! Underground roar detected! Target is alive! We can't just sit and wait. Contact Yokota Base. Keep bombing until the target is neutralized. The US Military is out of munitions. It'll take six months to get more. Oh, have the US military bill the Ministry of Defense. Not us. Target is in the open! This is bad. Only one mountain separates it from the storage facility. Now is our only chance for a direct attack. You're right. Gabora likely contains less radioactive material than the facility. Let's call for a saturation attack. Data team, be ready for the giant just in case! Have the radar sites monitor the skies! Roger! I wonder if Ultraman will show up again. Gabora is headed for the storage facility! Let's move to the command vehicle! Asami, stay here and watch for the giant! Roger! Let's show some spirit!! Huh? Where's Kaminaga? Huh?! Is that... Ultraman?! He appeared on the ground this time?! Why?! And his silver pattern has turned red! Why?! So that's Ultraman. Beautiful. Follow Ultraman! We're moving! Come on! If Ultraman uses his beam to destroy Gabora, it'll be catastrophic! He fires an unknown particle. There's no telling how it'll react with Gabora's nuclear atoms! Let's assume the worst. By the SSSP special provision, I'm raising the State of Emergency to High A! -Contact each ministry! Hurry! -Yes sir! There he is! It's Ultraman! Where's Gabora? I knew it, it has the same face as Pagos! Then it can fire a very nasty beam, too?! What?! Why isn't he dodging?! It's weird. Despite the amount of nasty beam it's shooting, the dosimeters aren't rising! Is he absorbing all the radiation and neutralizing it?! Yes, he is. He's protecting us. His red patterns are turning green! Is it a sign of something affecting him? It seems so. It might be due to a rapid loss of energy. He's taking Gabora away from us? Was he trying to avoid any more harm to us? Maybe because the cleanup would be difficult, like it was with Pagos? Yes. That's quite possible. He never used his beam. I don't know how, but he knew Gabora's qualities and understood our situation. And right before he left... He was making eye contact. Target and Gabora both lost. They disappeared again. Let's get back. Yes sir. Anyway, we may be able to communicate with Ultraman. There is hope. Welcome back! Pagos, Neronga, Gabora... Every part of their bodies was about the same except the head and back. Like those parts were interchangeable. Until now, Kaiju were all completely different. I finished my reports. Now there's nothing to do. We're on standby for Ultraman's next appearance, so all we can do is wait. He's only shown up to eliminate Kaiju. Where does he normally hide? The only place to regularly hide something of that size would be in the ocean. How does he breathe and eat? Can he understand human language and thought? The internet's overflowing with theories. Some civilians got the fight with Gabora on video and uploaded it. Right now the world's abuzz about it. ...admitted its existence, and has designated it as "Ultraman." Kaminaga's not in again today. Yeah. He acts on his own too much. Where is he off wasting time? Maybe I'll check with my old agency. THE SAVAGE MIND Where's your partner? Off on his own again without permission. What does he think "buddy" means? The Chief's here from the fifth floor. That's rare. Hopefully it's not a bad sign. Huh?! Wait! You're kidding. What's the cause? Unknown! Well, Taki? Taki! All of our data's toast. Who insisted on making these regulations? A closed environment and no backups! I want to **** them! Me too. Who are you?! Forgive me. That was my fault. You know extraterrestrials exist. There is no cause for alarm. My name is Zarab. Like Ultraman, I am a visitor from another planet. You can consider me Extraterrestrial No. 2. How did you get in here? That is a secret. I came here to communicate with you directly. You say "communicate." You understand our language? I have a translation app installed in one of your devices. It should be working. I'd like to test its capabilities. Can you speak this language? Of course. It is not a problem. I guess it's working. When I materialized, I emitted a powerful electromagnetic pulse. It seems that it caused your current situation. It wasn't my intent. To make it up to you, allow me to fix what I damaged. Whoa. How did you recover the lost data? I can do it by simply thinking. This ability is a function of my natural physiological makeup. Unfortunately, it is not something I can teach you to do. Let's get to the point. Why have you come here? To establish friendly relations with this country. This planet is divided into groupings called "countries." I wish to start a friendship with this island nation. Why our country? It is where I landed. That is all. Not because Ultraman is here? Please let me speak to the person you call Prime Minister. First a silver giant. Now a human-sized extraterrestrial that can talk? The Prime Minister and extraterrestrial are meeting in secret. I'm used to the unexpected. Nothing surprises me anymore. But if other countries get wind of an extraterrestrial who can communicate, it could complicate matters. They say he can control electromagnetic pulses. According to reports, he can erase and manipulate any electronic data. If Zarab gets angry, it won't just be global economic chaos. It'll be worse than any Kaiju! Now that the world knows of Ultraman, global politics, economies, militaries, and religions are being shaken to their cores. If he's friendly, then that's good. If we can form a treaty with him before the rest of the world, we'd gain the upper hand in all global politics. You were right. The details of the agreement are not favorable but unequal and one-sided. This country will essentially be subservient to Zarab. Huge quantities of intel have been leaked to other countries. It's likely that Zarab leaked it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is under a lot of back-channeled pressure. And Zarab hinted at visiting other nations in talks with the Prime Minister. He's better at politics than human politicians. He's an extraterrestrial after all. He has overwhelming technology on his side. Any help or technology Zarab offers could lead to world dominance. So they want a quick treaty to gain the global upper hand, regardless of how it's perceived by other nations. The motives of those in power never change. Curiosity killed the cat. It's your nature as an Intel officer, but this time you have gone too far. There you are, Zarab. Why are you playing secret games with world governments? To efficiently eliminate the native intelligent life forms. I plan to cause conflict between countries and have Homo Sapiens wipe themselves out. Humans have wisdom. It won't be so easy. It will be if I use the existence of Ultraman. Why wipe out humans? I want to know why. Once a marker is discovered on a planet, intelligent life forms must be destroyed. That is what I do. Homo Sapiens have destroyed species that they considered harmful. From my perspective, it is no different. And while Homo Sapiens possess sophisticated intellect and technology, they are a dangerous and unorganized species that breeds unnecessarily. They are worth wiping out. We agree to disagree then. Sorry, but I can't let you do that. Do not bother. You are already mine, Ultraman. Killing you is quite difficult. So, you must be detained until I finish my work. Time to sleep, Ultraman. KAMINAGA Alone again? Yup. Not even a daily check-in. So I got an old friend in the PSIA to track him for me. Any luck? Nope. Avoiding tails was part of his job, but he even managed to evade my elite former colleagues. He's actually really good. I wonder what he's up to today? This is Tamura. What? Ultraman's appeared at Yokosuka Base? He's destroying the base?! It really is Ultraman. Where's our deployment order? It hasn't been given. Or rather, it seems someone above is halting it. Captain, a counter-extraterrestrial team has been formed and has assumed command. That was too quick for the Prime Minister's Office. Someone's pulling strings. Open fire! Open fire! Stop him here! We're engaging Ultraman. Anti-ship missiles have no effect. Darn! What's the point of being combat ready? Can't we do anything? Ultraman has vanished! Vanished?! Prime Minister. It seems what I warned of has come to pass. TOKYO BAY LIVE CAMERA YOKOSUKA 1 That's strange. It's almost like he wants us to see him causing damage. It doesn't matter, Ultraman is now our enemy. What? You found Kaminaga's car? That's strange. He's not one to leave a trace. Whoa! Look at this! Is this a fake? There's no evidence of tampering. It's probably the original. I don't understand at all. Everything we've learned is for nothing! Find out who that man is! Analyzing the upload access log. Identifying the target. Sharing data now. That outfit looks kind of familiar. I've got the access log... Huh? My computer? Oh, there's other angles, too! Shinji Kaminaga?! Wait... He's Ultraman?! It's hard to believe. Facial recognition complete. There's no mistake. It's SSSP Member, Senior Superintendent Shinji Kaminaga. I see. My instincts are confused. But reason compels me to accept that it's true. He was an extraterrestrial all this time? I can't believe you never shared this! Some buddy you are! Asami, are you still unable to reach Kaminaga? It's not that I can't get through. His whole phone number has been canceled. If he really is Ultraman, then someone may have kidnapped him. Agreed. His car was abandoned for three days. You don't think a foreign intelligence agency... Not likely. He's not dumb enough to get captured by another agent. Then who? None of the city's security cameras have any trace of him. We can only assume every security video has been altered with pinpoint accuracy. The only one who can do this is... ULTRAMAN ELIMINATION PLAN PROPOSAL A being with this degree of destructive power is trying to annihilate you. As someone who simply wants peace, I cannot tolerate this extraterrestrial. I would like you to implement this Ultraman Elimination Plan. I am willing to disclose all information I have on him. Thank you. We deeply appreciate your kind offer. We gladly accept. If you don't mind, we have some questions for you. How does his light wave heat beam work? Spacium-133. Spacium-133? His body's made of a superheavy element, atomic no.133, the source of his energy. He emits a form of that. How does he fly? By utilizing the energy of Spacium-133. He warps gravity and manipulates it. How did he come here? No comment. Our interstellar agreements forbid us from revealing it to non-signatory life forms. What's the mechanism by which a human enlarges and transforms into Ultraman? I do not know. You will have to ask him. But... is Ultraman really our enemy? Isn't eliminating him being a little rash? I feel the giant in Yokosuka wasn't him. DPA Minister... If Ultraman reappears, you will realize that he must be eliminated. So you are awake, Ultraman. Sorry to immobilize you in that way. You require the Beta System to summon your Ultraman body from another dimension. I will now scan you again for the ignition device. Nothing. You do not have the ignition device. Where did you hide it? Very well. You can no longer transform into Ultraman. That is enough. KAMINAGA Only he could pull off a trick like this. BETA CAPSULE I LEAVE IT WITH YOU Why did he give this to me? Is this the device he uses to transform? He appeared again? Zarab was right. Ultraman really is our enemy. Yes. He was deceiving us all along. Absolutely. The SSSP report is not credible at all. And I thought I was at least a good judge of character. Order the SSSP to move out. Even if Ultraman's true identity is Kaminaga... We must fight against anything that threatens peace and order. Move out. Yes sir! Who are you? A former associate of the man who is Ultraman. You know where he is? Yes. He asked me to contact you if anything happened. Captain. It's all right. Permission granted. Let's go. Captain, where is Asami going? She has a separate mission. Asami is acting on her own. Like a true partner of his. After I parted with Kaminaga, Zarab appeared. He gave me a signal telling me to track him. Zarab abducted him, turned invisible, and vanished. But Kaminaga left a trail with special ink. This is where he's being held. My team makes sure to use only analog sources to prevent tampering. So I've given you a hard copy. Even when encrypted, phones and emails are always monitored. I see. It also looks like Zarab can't manipulate film negatives. The ink hasn't faded yet. It should lead straight to him. Thank you. I'll take it from here. Zarab can turn invisible. Utilizing that ability he can create optical illusions. Even a fake Ultraman. It would be easy for Zarab. This way. Electronics don't work here. It must be Zarab, I'm sure of it. I'm the SSSP captain, Tamura. I'm the platoon commander. We can't contact our bases in Ichigaya or Kisarazu. We're on our own. I've been told to follow your orders in such conditions. What should we do? This is a populated area. We should avoid attacking him. If I may, sir... I hear he's on your team. Are you letting him go? No. Anti-ship missiles are ineffective against him. All we can do is wait. Wait? For what? I didn't expect this from you, Asami. I underestimated you. The whole world knows who you are now. I see. So... You admit it. You made fools of us! You lied to us! I never lied. I just never told you. Why didn't you tell us?! What would you have done? All right. I won't judge you. A man claiming to be your former associate helped me. Were you always expecting me to rescue you? Of course. You're my buddy. Just tell me one thing. Are you an extraterrestrial? Or a human? I'm both. Some things are only clear when you are in between. I believe this is why I exist. I believe in you too. You trusted me with this. So I trust you. Your imposter is here and destroying the city. Take him out! What's that? Is that a person? I see her! That's our analyst, Asami! We're counting on you, Kaminaga. There's another Ultraman?! This one is the real one. Wow! That's Spacium-133! I knew it was Zarab. We were right. Thank you... Kaminaga. Yes! Former Senior Superintendent Kaminaga! Find him and secure him! Priority One. Intelligence agencies across the world are also looking. We have to find him first. All this and we still can't find him. Where has Shinji Kaminaga gone?! Kaminaga is right to stay hidden. If a person could become Ultraman, anyone would want to take advantage of him. What about his human rights? He's an extraterrestrial now. The government has already pronounced him dead. Quick work for a government office. They just want to use him as Ultraman no matter what. Japan's not the only country that does. Yeah, and with the Zarab incident, the Prime Minister's going around apologizing to the UN and G9. The Prime Minister's under pressure. But so are we. I saw old colleagues and CIA and SIS agents outside this morning. I made sure to say "Hi." Spying on us won't help. What a waste of time. Is Asami not in today? Yes. She's AWOL again. I get it's hard to come in after that, but disappearing gives the media the chance to say they've eloped. Her PSIA background makes them easy gossip targets. Anyone would want to disappear for a bit. But I'm worried. It's unlike her not to give any notice. What? Asami's been found? This way. Excuse me! Clear the way! Coming through! Excuse me! Excuse me! Clear the way! Coming through! Excuse me! Let us through! Excuse me! Let us through! Excuse me! Excuse me! Whoa. It really is Asami. Anti-tank choppers are on their way. Tell the brass to hold their attack. Let's get closer. Asami! Are you Hiroko Asami?! What's wrong?! Can you hear me?! Answer me! Look at those blank eyes. She seems hypnotized. We're under attack from the giant female! Evacuate the area! Casualties expected! The Prime Minister has authorized lethal force. Permission to fire? Hold your fire. She may be giant, but she could still be human. That's right. You'd be wise not to attack her. This is a demonstration. Just a presentation to you native species of this planet. Who are you?! Show yourself! There's no need for that. I just want you to know that Ultraman isn't the only one with this technology. Good day. Asami! Is she dead?! No, she's alive! I can detect breathing! Thank goodness. That voice hinted at offering advanced technology. They'll contact us. Let's wait for them. I'll join you there. Understood, sir. The ability to make humans gigantic could lead to the militarization of Ultraman. It won't just be Japan. The whole world will want this. This'll be another hassle. And Kaminaga's nowhere to be found. It's like Sleeping Beauty mixed with Gulliver's Travels. Chief, those references are too old. Analysis complete. We did composite electromagnetic scans of her body. There are heat energy variances, but all other data is flat, even her clothes. It's like her entire body's composed of an unknown homogenous material different from human somatic cells. Like Ultraman? What about bio samples? It's just that. Normal cutting devices, even lasers, can't cut a single hair. We couldn't even cut off a single micron of body tissue. Her clothes too. We couldn't get any samples. She's practically indestructible. Even empty-handed, she could function as a weapon. We don't know anything about her current state. All we know is that she's breathing and she's still alive. Yeah. Just what is life? This flips biological science on its head. All the knowledge humanity has accumulated up to now amounts to nothing more than common sense for extraterrestrials. Don't be so discouraged. That's what that voice wants. It left Asami behind so we'd study her and realize that we can't grasp their secret of human enlargement, making its presentation that much more valuable. Well done. You're correct. Sorry. The door was unlocked. No, I locked it. MEFILAS, EXTRATERRESTRIAL #0 AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY That's very kind of you. "When in Rome do as the Romans do." One of my favorite sayings. As those who've had direct contact with Ultraman, I wanted to begin negotiations through you. My name is Mefilas. I am Extraterrestrial No. 0. I have come to bring this planet gospel. Number zero? Yes. I actually arrived here before Ultraman. I have been preparing my presentation for some time now. So you're the voice from earlier? Yes. But he looks human. We could not distinguish Ultraman from ourselves either. First we'd like proof you're an extraterrestrial. Then we'll talk. This alone should be enough proof. But everything starts with trust. Whoa... I don't believe it. This is a Beta Box. While not miniaturized like Ultraman's Beta Capsule, it has the same fundamental structure. I'm not even drunk. Why am I sleeping in plastic sheets? So now a third one. First Kaiju, and now even extraterrestrials are normal in Japan. All rise! Sorry for the wait. Not at all. Let's get down to business. "Strike while the iron is hot." One of my favorite sayings. We seek the same thing, to create a world brimming with peace and joy that permeates the multiverse. SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST EXTRATERRESTRIALS THROUGH MAKING HUMANS GIANT I abhor violence. But when it comes to violent beings like Zarab, sometimes power is necessary for defense. As a deterrent, I will provide you with a large quantity of Beta Boxes. In return... I ask that you consider me the Superior Conception. Your laws can remain the same. It won't have an effect on your lives. That's all that I ask. I understand. We will consider your proposal favorably. There's no telling when the next extraterrestrial will attack. "Better safe than sorry." One of my favorite sayings. Did you hear? The Secretary-General's lobbying for human-to-giant experiments. I heard. Weaponizing the Beta System is more efficient than dealing with nukes. Soon the whole world will follow. Can't anyone consider a peaceful use? Oh. Welcome back. How'd you like being prodded and probed by every government agency? They put me through the most humiliating of tests, yet found nothing. All I got for it was days of indignity. Then there's this. The whole world now knows my face, I can never return to the PSIA! You're a big star, Asami. You've taken over the top ten rankings on social media across the world! Oh, no! Can't I just use public authority to erase all of this! Mefilas... I'll never forgive you for this! Message? From who? My deepest apologies. I did not imagine such crass individuals existed. I was foolish not to take humans' base impulses into account. I know it's too late, but please allow me to make amends for my mistake. I do hope you'll forgive me. Regards, Mefilas. Yes! Our time has come. "We are all in the same boat." One of my favorite sayings. Well? Will you work with me on behalf of this planet? That depends on you, Mefilas. Well, in a way, you're already working for me. So, it was you. You were the one who woke the bioweapons of this planet. No, it was the humans' destruction of the environment that awoke the Kaiju. The wrath of Mother Nature. It's like karma, Ultraman. Unlike the native species of this planet, we are civilized. I'm in compliance with our interstellar agreements. Any interference with other planets is limited to the use of living creatures. The initial creatures were just for reconnaissance and tactical use. I then used the next-generation Invisible Kaiju to attack the electrical industry. And the subterranean Kaiju was designed to feed on nuclear waste. They also served as sufficient bait to lure you out. I wanted my plan to be as cost-effective as possible. So, I've used what I could obtain on this planet, including Zarab. By having them fight you... I made humans feel physically powerless. Revealing the Beta System made them feel intellectually powerless. I wanted them to learn firsthand their dependence on the mighty. You have been instrumental in instilling in humanity my idealistic notion of unconditional obedience to extraterrestrial life. I am very grateful to you. You are the first successful example of human fusion. It was also demonstrated in my experiment. Thanks to that, we now know that humanity is an effective biological resource and can be converted into a powerful and formidable weapon. I want to have absolute dominion over this abundant and precious biological resource before it is ravaged by other intelligent life. That's my only interest, Ultraman. Moreover... I think humanity should possess the Beta System for self-defense in the event of invasion from other extraterrestrials. I must thank Zarab. He made it hard for you to get around in human society. But, this is unsettling. Let's get a drink. Kaminaga! I thought we were buddies. I should never have trusted him! I'd rather not fight you. That's why I suggest you either work with me or stand down. The life and death of humanity is in my hands. I can use force at any time. Obviously you can, too. But you choose not to. Why? As you said, for us to rule humans would be to take all hope from them. It would stifle their independent progress. I can't allow that. By the Code of the Planet of Light, yes? Then stay out of my affairs, Ultraman. I know this planet's value... More than anyone in the multiverse. Surrendering this planet to me is the best option. Above all, I desire this beautiful planet for myself. I, too, love the human race, Ultraman. You have already made a secret agreement with this country. The natives sought the Beta System of their own accord. Your Code keeps you from interfering with native species. You can't stop this. My plan is perfect. How will you respond, Ultraman? By brute force if necessary. That's the will of the human inside me. The Code doesn't apply to him. I see. So that's why you fused with a native. A wise decision. That's not why. But I suppose that's the outcome. The Planet of Light is aware of your actions. You're going to end up dooming this planet. Even so, I want to protect these helpless, vulnerable little life forms. Are you sure... that's your wish and not that of the human inside you, Ultraman? How disappointing... A failure to reach an agreement. -Excuse me. -Yes? -Check please. -Right away. Do you mind if we split it, Ultraman? KAMINAGA What are you doing with that guy?! Where are you?! I can't tell you. It's better that you not know. I'll come to you. You choose the location, buddy. All right. I'll tell the team. Cell phones aren't secure, so use S115 for contact. Understood. Thank you. I was really hoping to take a bath today. Take the Beta Box from Mefilas? You mean steal it. That means going against the government. It's a crime. Even so, I need your help. Mefilas has already cut a deal. The handover is tomorrow. We don't have time. We have to stop this before the government gets the Beta Box. Abuse of the Beta System is too dangerous for humans at the present time. So basically too much of a good thing. If humans can be used as bioweapons, there may come a day when extraterrestrials go to war over us. Exactly. It's my fault for proving it's possible. And yet I got all of you involved. I'm sorry. All right. I'll handle the higher-ups. Thank you, Captain. But how do we get the Beta Box? It's hidden in the Planck brane dimension. I need to locate its position. We can't perceive the Planck brane. So how...? If the system retains the first subject's data, you could trace that. That's impossible. Quantified physical data can't be detected from the outside. One piece of data can't be quantified. The smell. The smell? Residual odor. There's no time. It'll have to do. Huh? Now? Sorry. I've been too busy to take a shower recently. It's fine. I can still identify your scent. That's not what I'm talking about! Thank you. I have your scent memorized. I'll find it. Platoon One, guard the west side! Here you go. It was so nice of you to choose a location visible to other nations' spy satellites. It must have been difficult. The deal is done. Go ahead. I understand. And now... You searched directly inside the Planck brane using a woman's scent? For the noble Ultraman to engage in such licentious behavior... "The ends justify the means." One of my least favorite sayings. Nice catch! Okay! Go! Mr. Tamura's made a fool of you. Wouldn't you say so... Mr. Mefilas? Instead of destroying the Beta Box, its fate is now left to the native species... "If at first you don't succeed, try try again." One of my least favorite sayings. I always provide a full warranty. Please kindly wait a moment. How unfortune it is we must fight... Ultraman. Mefilas. Take your Beta System and leave this planet. Regretfully, I must refuse. Spacium Energy sustains you. But the load of expanding from the Planck brane as well as maintaining your fusion with another species is causing rapid depletion. I can sustain myself with negentropy but you can only fight for a limited time. Will it be long enough to defeat me, Ultraman? This is pointless, Ultraman. Unfortunately, I'll have to step aside here. This planet is no longer worth killing you over. I will take the Beta Box with me as you requested. Why did Mefilas stop fighting? It looks like they talked extraterrestrial to extraterrestrial. Talking things out peacefully is always the best solution. Received and accepted. There's a complication afoot. I should leave before things get unpleasant. Farewell, Ultraman. Thank you. You were there for us all the way back to safety. He stayed with us right up to his limit. His one weakness is his high energy depletion on Earth. Just relax, let them do their job. She gets stressed out so easily. Detainment without an arrest warrant is a human rights violation! If we are suspected of violation of our duties, why aren't we in jail? The Chief is working to get us restored. Plus this is also for our protection. Some countries are hinting at nuclear attacks if we don't give them intel. And a US special forces team has arrived in Japan. They surely want to kidnap the SSSP members who know Ultraman's human form. That's why we're protecting them. I figured. The man who is Ultraman remains in hiding. The SSSP holds the vital position as the only liaison to him. Personally... I'd like them to return to work as soon as possible. It's true they broke the law. But how about we say they were being coerced by the man who is Ultraman? Uh... How about that as an excuse? That will work. I'll tell that to the Prime Minister's Office. We're free to go. Let's get back to HQ. Yes sir! Come to think of it, why does Ultraman take the form of Kaminaga? You took this man's life, Lipiah. No, I'll call you by the name you've been given on this planet, Ultraman. That's right. He lost his life trying to protect a young human from my impact blast. An intriguing life form, one willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of others. I want to understand him. So you decided to do the forbidden, and merge with a human. That's right. You came as the new emissary from the Planet of Light? My name is Zōffy. Because you broke the Code of the Planet of Light, I'm now the watcher of the indigenous creatures called humans on this planet. At the same time, I am their adjudicator. The humans of this planet will likely evolve in the same way as we have. Therefore, we have decided to disposed of them. Zōffy, I believe the planet's decision is a mistake. A mistake... The mistake was your fusion with a human. Each of the billions of humans can be used as a bioweapon. Now, every intelligent life form in the multiverse knows that. The best decision is to prune them all now while we have the chance. As the adjudicator, I have brought the Ultimate Celestial Suppression Weapon. You mean Zetton? Yes. I'm activating its autonomous program, that will exterminate the human race along with the entire star system. The Planet of Light has documented nearly 13 billion intelligent life forms. The loss of one will have no impact on the universe. For the inhabitants of this planet... One is all there is. Is the intelligent life on this planet worth dying over... Ultraman? Shouldn't we answer? They're just going to ask us to deal with that thing orbiting the Earth. Don't answer unless it's the Chief. They just want to make us get Kaminaga to do something. They are depending on Ultraman for everything now. Humans have always prayed to god when desperate. Ultraman is now the closest thing we have to a god. No wonder people cling to him. Kaminaga?! There's something I must tell you all. About the thing in the sky? That's right. It's called Zetton. I want the details, but you're going to be in serious trouble if you stay here. Shinji Kaminaga... or should I call you Ultraman? We'd like you to come with us. I'm sorry, but right now I need to talk with my team. We can't allow that. The government has ratified a treaty placing Ultraman under the joint control of Japan and a newly established UN organization. Try to understand Japan's difficult position. I don't get involved with human society. I'm merely an observer. I am not a threat to you. Sadly, an overwhelming majority of the international community doesn't trust you. If you won't come with us, we can't guarantee the lives of the SSSP. Intimidation is a terrible thing for a human to do. If you do that... I won't hesitate to wipe out the humans before Zetton does. Isn't that intimidation, too? It's negotiating on equal ground. If you wish for humans to live, please refrain from futile attempts to meddle with the SSSP. Understood. We don't want a zero-sum game. We'll back off. So Zetton is still in the process of assembling its attack system. Another being from my home planet, Zōffy, has released control of the weapon. Once the weapon is ready, a one-terakelvin superheated ball of energy will be launched without warning from Zetton toward Earth. A one-terakelvin fireball? That's a trillion degrees! That'll evaporate the entire solar system, affecting an area light-years wide! An immensely powerful force. Humans can't do anything about that. Can Zōffy be reasoned with? He follows the Code of the Planet of Light. Our only choice is to defeat Zetton. How many thermonuclear weapons does the world's stockpile contain? The equivalent of roughly two-million kilotons of TNT. Totally insufficient. That won't stop Zetton. Obviously! We humans are tiny beings on this tiny Earth. To the outside world, we're insignificant. Letting Ultraman handle it is the optimal solution. Kaminaga, it's in your hands now. Can you defeat Zetton by yourself? If you do, you may succeed. If you don't, you will not. This is always true. Now I must do. All right. Let's do it! Show some spirit! Resistance is futile. Stand aside and await humanity's purge, Ultraman. No. I believe in humans and I will resist to the end. That is my choice. You couldn't defeat Zetton. You knew you couldn't. Kaminaga... Ultraman... has lost. I see. The Prime Minister has decided not to disclose the truth about Zetton to anyone. Just do nothing and let humanity die oblivious as an act of mercy. So be it. Captain, what are our orders for Zetton? To do nothing. I see. You're still working, Funaberi? A bioweapon is still an organism. It must have a weakness. I'll find it. Living creatures live by survival of the fittest. Weak creatures can become extinct. Humanity would be no exception. If we want to survive, we have to become strong. That's why we have wisdom, resilience, and courage. The godlike Ultraman couldn't beat it. There's nothing we can do. Despair weakens the spirit. It feels better to have hope. Hope? That's ridiculous! It doesn't matter what we do! We're useless. Useless. Totally useless! Taki... I don't think Kaminaga believes that. First, I apologize for the situation I caused. I forced you to undergo rapid advancement to ensure the survival of the human race. Here are the basic principles of the Beta System, and theorems on higher-dimensional domains converted into your written language. Rather than being given a completed Beta System device, I would like humans to use their knowledge to create it for themselves. How humanity uses it is up to you. Lastly, Ultraman is not an omnipotent god. Like you, he is a living organism. I place my hopes in all of humanity. Taki, you take if from here. Right. If we utilize the dimensional transfer principle, maybe we can shift Zetton's heat energy into the Planck brane. A global summit of scholars to derive a Zetton attack strategy? That's right. It's not just about physics. We'll gather the whole of human knowledge and derive a formula for defeating Zetton. It's Taki's idea. Humanity can survive. We believe utilizing what Kaminaga left us to be the only way. It's a meeting of the greatest minds in the world, but it sure looks funny from here. Yeah. But that's what's great about it. Kaminaga. Taki and the others are cultivating the seed of hope you left for us. We humans can be persistent. I want you to see it. So you have to wake up. Zetton has left orbit. It's descending. It appears to have entered its final firing position. No! There's no time! Wait! We have to talk to you. Using your theorem, we were able to derive a single method to defeat Zetton. Igniting the Beta Capsule twice will open a sixth-dimensional hole to the Planck brane. You will have 1 millisecond to focus the resulting gravity wave on the Zetton fireball's heat energy and push Zetton through the extradimensional opening into the Planck brane. I see. After transforming, I have to hit Zetton in one millisecond. Basically, yes. What will happen to Ultraman? We predict he'll be caught in the event and sent to some parallel dimension. What?! Then this plan is out. We can't sacrifice you, even to save humanity. It's fine. Your future is my top priority. My life is but a tool to use to that end. I trust you. Promise you'll come back. See you soon! Right. Be right back. Ultraman. Wake up. Without the signal of your desire to survive, I could not have found you. The acceptance of death is the same as the desire for life. Thank you, Zōffy. So, to both accept death and thirst for life is the core of human nature. Indeed, humans are fascinating. I respect humanity's bravery, intellect, and vitality that let you defeat Zetton. They are too precious to destroy. You are injured. I will bring you home and we can leave humans be. Come. Let's return to the Planet of Light, Ultraman. Zōffy, I share this body with a human. To allow him to live, I will remain on Earth. Ultraman. You now understand him so well that you're willing to sacrifice yourself for him. He must understand you as well. He will forgive you. By fusing with an organism of this planet... I sought to understand him and his people. But I believe humans are too complex to simply understand. That's why I wish to become human and learn more about them. And humanity is running out of time. Fearing their ability to defeat Zetton, other intelligent life forms will continue to appear on Earth. But humanity is very young. In order to give them even the slightest fighting chance... I will remain on Earth. Ultraman... that's not possible. I must return you to the Planet of Light. You must face the consequences of breaking our Code. Zōffy. In that case, give my life to him. I want to leave this body to the humans of tomorrow. Even if it means your death? Yes. To be human is to accept death. Human lives are far shorter than ours. I want him to live. His partner and friends feel likewise. I wish to grant them this. Ultraman... Have you become so fond of humans. Very well. I will grant you your wish. Thank you, Zōffy. I am going to separate your body from Kaminaga's. Kaminaga! Kaminaga... Kaminaga! Welcome home. Because the distant star shined so bright I trembled as I ran after its light In a cracked mirror, I stared at a reflection of my past self I wanted to be strong, in awe of everything You looked up at a hat Fluttering in the wind As you went on a long and short journey Traces of bygone days If you so wish, He'll come to your aide with everything he has For now, fear nothing And be the only one to understand the meaning of pain A flower about to wilt said its last words to me "Though you may no longer see me, I'll watch over you from afar" Yes You're absolutely shattered, Your heart's been worn down The story begins with A bit of loneliness If the touch of your hand is The power of loneliness that brings us together Who has the right to take that away? We'll keep seeking each other until our lives are lost From beyond the leaves of the trees, A shining star says With a level gaze, You think of the future Unaware, We'll keep travelling towards the beyond If you so wish, He'll come to your aide with everything he has For now, fear nothing And be the only one to understand the meaning of pain Show me that slight smile that resembles that star Just be the one to understand the meaning of pain EXECUTIVE SUPERVISOR HIDEAKI ANNO
