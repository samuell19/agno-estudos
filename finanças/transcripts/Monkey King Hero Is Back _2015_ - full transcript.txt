According to legend, long ago there was a Monkey King named Sun Wukong. He was so resourceful and had great power. Once he alone caused great disturbance in the Heavenly Palace and angered the Supreme God. You wicked monkey! You dare break the Holy Law? Surrender immediately! Eat this! What are you waiting for? Capture him! Nezha to the rescue! Shoot now! You're going down. The Monkey King destroyed the heavenly army. It was a flawless victory. But the Supreme Buddha, Ru Lai, was not gonna tolerate his contempt of the Heavens. Since then Sun WuKong was pinned under the great weight of Wu Xing Mountain. 500 years have passed... Don't worry, the Monkey King never died, he just... fell asleep. It's getting dark, we need to hurry! Got it. We're coming! Fine! You guys in the back, keep up! Be careful! -I see something! -Be careful. It's mountain trolls! Hurry! Mountain trolls! Warn the rest! Hurry down the hill! What is that sound? A baby! Poor child. Where do you come from? Come here child. Thank you for this blessing. Bravo! Sun Wukong the Great Monkey King fights the four Heavenly Kings! Bravo! But Sun WuKong can never die! Liuer Jiang, you again? Fa Ming, keep your disciple in check! Don't let me catch you again! Sun WuKong is here. Puny god, state your name! Jade Emperor, you old fart! Eat my stick! Master! Liuer, what are you doing here! I'm... begging for alms! Thank you for this blessing. Liuer... I hope you grow up to be a good monk. OK? I can't take care of you forever. Master? Is filling our stomach the only thing we Monks do? How is that different from everyone else? Of course we are different. Begging for alms is just a starting point to being a great monk. Meditation, recite scripture, deep thinking... Do not ask for much and you will find peace in your heart. Look at me, your master is looking pretty well, isn't he? But the Mountain Trolls keep attacking. Reciting scripture is not gonna scare them away. Then what do you want to do? I want to practice Kung Fu and fight the monsters! Shut up! Liuer Jiang, listen carefully we monks should show people the right way. To save the world, you don't have to be a warrior. Meditation, deep thinking, begging... We monks are saving the world with each little good deed. We can understand, we can see, we can trust and comprehend. All that you see is an illusion. Life is an illusion from your desires. Superficial thinking drives wisdom away. Don't be fascinated with fighting and killing! -Now you should... -Get it, recite scripture, deep thinking. Wrong! It's begging for alms! Yes, master. Mountain Trolls are coming! Mountain Trolls! Arrows! Now! Let's go! Liuer! Liuer! Liuer! Liuer Jiang! One... two... four... It's 48 in total. This is too old! We can't have it! But boss, we are still short of one baby girl... Baby girl is coming! Baby girl is here! Liuer, what are you doing? Try and stay out of trouble! Come on Master, run! What is happening? -Hurry Master! -Liuer! They're right behind us! Master, this way! Master! Liuer, run! Run! Where is the baby? Here she is! Ah? You stupid! Liuer, where are you? Liuer! Run! Wow! Where'd the monkey come from? Well don't just stand there. Get him! Ru Lai you fool! I was trapped here by you for 500 years. Isn't that enough? Don't forget... I'm the Great Sage Equalling Heaven! The Great Sage Equalling Heaven! Who is there? Show yourself! Now! You again? Are you the real Great Sage Equaling Heaven? Yes. Why? Him? He is the one! Don't follow me! You brat! Great Sage! That way. Thank you, God of Land. Great Sage! Wait for me. Great Sage, what are you doing here? Nothing... Great Sage, I just saw you talking to the Buddha statue. You must have seen... Come up, brat! Great Sage. You must have seen the Supreme Buddha. Do you think he can hear me when I'm reciting the scripture? Yes, he can hear. The old man just loves to poke his nose in others' business. Great Sage, you must know a lot of magic! I know you do! The Great Sage Equalling Heaven, Sun Wukong. His body is as hard as steel and his eyes are as bright as fire. He is immortal and has mastered 72 transformations. His flying cloud travels far and away. You can make clones from your hair by blowing. There is nothing here. And... Great Sage, There was one more thing. Do you have your Golden Crudgel? I heard that it weighs 15000 pounds! Great Sage, where is your Golden Crudgel? The puppet show told us it was hidden in your ear. Show me! You brat! You won't stop talking will you? I can't think 'cause my head is gonna explode! Why can't you just keep quiet for a while? OK... No more questions about the Golden Crudgel! Great Sage, does Erlang Shen really have three eyes? So cool! Great Sage, is the Mighty Miracle God really as strong as they say? Yes. Are the Four Heavenly Kings brothers? They are sisters! Is Nezha a boy? Girl. Does the Pagoda Bearing God have a pagoda? No! Sun Wukong, how dare you! I, the Mountain Lord, was created to make sure you would not escape. You dare to leave without my permission! Puny god, who do you think you are? Since you know who I am, why don't you just get lost? Sun Wukong, the seal on you still works. Right now, you are just a pathetic monkey! You have nothing to brag about! I'll punch you straight down to... Come back, you coward! The seal! You have nowhere to run! Stay here. Look, Great Sage! It seems that the thing inside Wu Xing Mountain taught you a good lesson. Can it be the Monkey King? My lord... Are you saying that hairy-faced monkey is Sun Wukong? I'm actually very curious to see... what tricks he can pull off now. Great Sage! What a coincidence. I thought I may never find you again. I left you on the mountain. I remember I fell off the cliff. I think there was a big fish that was trying to eat us. Oh! I know! The Great Sage must've saved us! The Great Sage saved us! Great Sage! Thank you for saving us. No, no, no! Master said we monks can't eat meat! Monk? My name is Liuer Jiang, I'm a travelling monk. My master's name is Fa Ming. We live in Chang'an city. What are you doing here in Wu Xing Mountian? It was the mountain trolls, they kidnap all the kids. I met her unexpectedly, Then the mountain trolls kept chasing us. That's why we were here. Damn trolls. But everything is fine now! We have you! We are afraid of nothing. Did I say I will protect you? When we leave the mountain... you will be someone else's trouble! But Great Sage... Be careful, it's too hot! Great Sage? I'm ok... Silly girl. Great Sage, there is a temple here. Great Sage! Great Sage, the Supreme Buddha is here! Supreme Buddha? I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. Monster! You better not hurt her! That's the Great Sage Sun Wukong! The Great Sage Sun Wukong? Look at his messy hair, how can he be the Great Sage? If he is him, then I am Marshal Tian Peng! He truly thinks he is Sun Wukong. Kid, hold this for me. Let me show you how I will beat this "Great Sage." Stupid monkey, prepare yourself! It really is him! Stinkin' monkey... You're the reason I came crashing down here in the first place! I was starving every single day for the last 500 years! Look how thin I am now! Today I will have my revenge! Fine, want revenge? Come get it. Stinky monkey, stop! Don't you dare run way! He is gone. I'll spare you today! Don't let me see you again! You don't dare to follow him, do you? Nonsense! How can I find him in the deep forest? He is too fast. Marshal Tian Peng isn't even as good as the God of Land. What? God of Land? I'll have you know I've led armies of thousands! I can change into 36 appearances. That stinkin' monkey hasn't taken a bath in 500 years, I can find him just by his smell! Kids look carefully, don't blink. Let me transform into the Heavenly Dog and arrest him! Indeed you are... howling at the Heavens. All right! Let's go! Follow that monkey! You are being serious? Great Sage is going that way! Great Sage! Great Sage is there! Great Sage! Great Sage, wait for me! Great Sage... Marshal Tian Peng wants to challenge you for a fight. Strange, he was here just now... Great Sage, you knew each other? He is the real Marshal Tian Peng? I thought he is like a... A pig. He is better looking now than before. But his 36 transformations are cool! That's nothing. His transformations don't last long. Mr. Pig, you're here! I thought you wouldn't dare to come. Since you won't give up, let's fight! Interesting, you look exactly like me! Your belly is bigger than mine. Awesome! Do it again! Great Sage, look! Run! Stay back! Don't move! Great Sage, you scared that thing away. You realize you almost became his lunch? Why would you wanna provoke a White Dragon? It was you! You annoying pig! I should feed you to the dragon! Do it! It's just a dragon... Great Sage, please let him go. It was my fault. Please, don't! Please... Why are you speaking for him? His ear is turning red... Great Sage, the dragon is gone! Monkey, let me go or I won't make it easy for you. I'm really angry now! Dragons really can fly. Freedom is nice. -It will be so nice if I can fly. -So what? I can fly. Then I can fly over that mountain and find my master. Take the silly girl home. If one day you are strong enough, brave enough... then you can take control of all these. Great Sage, is that true? Great Sage! Great Sage! You have been to the Dragon's Palace? Was the Dragon huge? He was huge, but stingy. Great Sage... there are lots of dragons in this world, right? Of course, you will find them near all waters. There is a house ahead. Finally I have something to eat! Little master, wait for me! Great Sage, hurry up! Great Sage, hurry up! Wait, don't move! Welcome... Sorry for the interruption, anyone home? Anyone home? Strange... no one is here. I'm her... Anyone here? Mister, we are travelers. Can we stay here for the night? Stay where? Sorry, sorry... Don't mind him. Something's wrong with his head. Young master, where are you traveling to? We are heading to Chang'an City. What a cutie pie! Hurry and make some tea for us! Young master, I suggest you not go to Chang'an city. I heard it is under attack by those mountain trolls. Monsters! Monsters! Monsters! Monsters! Ma'am, they are good people, don't be scared. Good people? They just look weird... Young master says you look weird. There is nothing to worry about. We'll stay here for the night. We'll leave tomorrow morning. -For real? -For real. OK, then follow me. Thank you. It's OK, it's OK. Hey, you! Quit making me look stupid! We are greatly honored to have you as our guests. Bed! Please rest well. Let us know if you need anything. What are you standing around for? Go find something to do! Can the baby stop crying for a while? Silly girl, don't cry. It's bed time already. Look, I have this little Great Sage here. You want it? With him protecting us, there is nothing to be afraid of. Time to sleep. Useless fool. It's so quiet here. Without the sound of the forest... I can hardly fall asleep. It's only been a few days for you. I'm the one who can't sleep. Yeah, sorry. Great Sage, if I find my master, and the silly girl finds her family... Where will you go? Mount Huaguo. Mount Huaguo? I know that place! It's in all the stories! In the stories, Mount Huaguo is a holy and secret place covered by fruit trees, flowers and grass. It's surrounded by mountains and waters, with endless spring. And, it's said the peaches there are as big as rice bowls! You believe everything people say? Actually, the peaches are as big as your head. As big as... my head? How far is Mount Huaguo from here? Very far. I will spend my lifetime getting there. But that distance is nothing to the Great Sage. Of course, if I want, I can be there in no... Great Sage... When we get home, I will be a good monk. Because you said the Supreme Buddha will hear me. Then maybe I can ask him to restore your power. You little brat. Talking all the time. The old man has heard too much of your gibberish. He's going to be annoyed and punish me even more, then... Maybe one day. What are you doing here? Why are you so nervous? Stealing food again? Any update on those travelers? By the way, what are you standing there for? Come with me. It's strange... How can a monkey be such a pain? Why was it necessary to transform us, huh? Isn't the Lord being too careful? I'm talking to you! I say... Why don't we just finish him up by ourselves! Where are you going? Wait. I'm just kidding... You fool! You know what the Lord will do if you ruined his plan. Wait! Stupid pig, how dare you trick me! Help! You really think you can trick me? Careful! Young master, where are you going? Save the kid! You bit my butt! Run! Run! Great Sage! Let's go! Where is that monkey? Great Sage, this way! To the boat! Faster! Hold her for me. Great Sage... Great Sage, look. Leave her alone. The Great Sage Equalling Heaven? Just a useless monkey. Young master, you are being naughty. Sun Wukong, you never saw this coming, did you? Great Sage! We have to save the silly girl! Come on! Great Sage! She's not my problem. Great Sage...! I said, she's not my problem! I can't take care of that kid. Easy, monkey... Don't call me monkey! Shut your mouth, you stupid pig! But now only you can save her... I'll go save her! Young master! Young master! Monkey, young master is gone. Monkey! That stupid monkey! So painful! Faster or we'll miss the Lord's sacrifice ceremony! Great Sage, let's go save the silly girl. Great Sage! This... is not my problem. Not my problem...! Great Sage... Great Sage! Look, I have this little Great Sage here. You want it? When he is around, there is nothing to be afraid of. Monkey... Monkey! Are you still alive? Say something. I know you don't want this. But you... Don't forget... You are the Great Sage. The Great Sage, Sun Wukong. The body is as hard as steel and the eye is as bright as fire. He is immortal and has 72 transformations. With his flying cloud, he can travel far and away. Pig. Follow me. There is a temple... on Wu Xing Mountain. By the riverside... -By the riverside... -By the riverside... under the eaves. By the riverside, under the eaves! I take the essence... of boys... and girls. For immortality! Young master, what a coincidence! What a naughty boy... This side, hit it harder. Liuer, are you OK? Master, how did you come here? Finding you is not a easy job. I'm taking you out, don't run off again. Sure, I will do whatever you say! Don't lie to the Supreme Buddha, he will punish you for that. This is our punishment! Master, look! So many children... Why are you standing around like fools? Master! Silly girl! My Lord, we are running out of time... Sun Wukong, you just cannot leave me alone, can you? Liuer... Where is that coward, Sun Wukong? He is not a coward! Tell me! Where is he? Great Sage, he came! The Great Sage Equalling Heaven is real! Stupid monkey... Monster! Sun Wukong here, you better give up now... Marshal Tian Peng is here! Monster, you're in big trouble now! Pig, careful! Weakling. Leave them alone! Great Sage! Sun Wukong. How's this taste compared to your Sacred Peach? I said, leave them alone! Great Sage! Let me go! Great Sage! I'm fine. Let me rest a bit, we leave together. Take it, don't lose it again. Run! Run! Master, I'm going to help the Great Sage! Liuer! Be careful. Great Sage, how should I help you? Why did you come back? What are you doing here? Go away, run! But you promised that we'd leave together! Silly kid, did you forget? I'm the Great Sage Equalling Heaven. I won't die. Great Sage! Liuer Jiang, what are you doing? -Liuer Jiang! -Monster, eat my stick! No! You big fat bug! I'm here! Come and catch me! Liuer Jiang! Liuer Jiang! You fool! Fool! Liuer Jiang! Great Sage! Liuer Jiang... Liuer Jiang... Great Sage! Great Sage! Translated by: Jasper Chen
