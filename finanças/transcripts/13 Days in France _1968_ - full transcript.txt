This is not the official film of the Olympic Winter Games. It is neither a sports film nor a film with a message. A few directors present in Grenoble in February '68 filmed events around them and within them in silence. They now present these 13 days that shook their world. 13 DAYS IN FRANCE He's off, Dominique. He's going too fast! Signal to him he's going a bit too fast. No, forget it. Forget it. I'm on the top of the podium. It's hard to hear from here. Give the signal anytime, but let us know first so we can stop the traffic. Dominique, are you ready? - I'm ready. - Anytime you want now. Just say when. One day, you'll say I was there to do all that And all that means In our country today We're proud to have Killy You'll say My city changed every day Huge lines of cars were arriving From all over From all over One day, you'll say I saw it all, choppers and bulldozers You'll say I saw the planes, the TV crews Hostesses and riot cops The carnival had come to town With guests in disguise All the costumes arrived From all over From all over One day, you'll talk About the abattoirs And the billions poured in For roads and stations But maybe you'll forget it all I'd like to say a few words about this rehearsal. As an audience, we found it far from satisfactory. I wish to remind you that it has never been a sign of character not to take part in the whole range of group exercises. Firstly, you all chatter away incessantly, and it is more than audible within the stadium. Next week, on February 6th exactly, you will be left to your own devices. If you make comments among yourselves, it will be as out of place, if not more so, as sloppy behaviour during a national anthem. You must be convinced of what you are doing. Line up on the first rows. After the blue, stay on the right. Then comes that sort of gully where they were timing us. Right there, cut to the inside of the gate. - You have to pass it - - On the left. Then you have - I'll start again. The blue's here. Your track is here. Then the red, and the gully where they were timing us. You arrive here and pass on the inside, in the middle of the gate. Then you take the gully and cut to the left after it. You cut to the left, then the right. I'll follow you. I don't understand! There's a sled reserved at post number 8. Repeat your message. Can you confirm that the sled handler is at post number 8? Victor is there. I'm honoured to invite General Charles de Gaulle to declare open the X Olympic Winter Games. I declare open the X Olympic Winter Games in Grenoble. Evelyne Delorme, 12, Pierre and Joseph Gras, six and four, are waiting for their parents by the podium. Competitors in the nonstop event - in the nonstop event are sent off- are sent off every 30 seconds. I repeat, they are sent off every 30 seconds. Therefore... proceed with extreme caution... when evacuating... skiers who fall. - Faster! - Faster! Oh, no! Get ready, I'll give you the start signal. When he says so, you go. IBM RESULTS MEN'S DOWNHILL You have just conquered time And yet you already know That it will carry on its way When all that you will recall Will be a thousand children's cheers You have just jostled time And yet you can guess That all this is an illusion And if for a while It seems to fly or stand still Or stretch out Its march never changes For a walk in the woods On the peaceful banks of a stream In the quagmire of war We are the ones who change It never does You have just dissected time Do you know what awaits you? Do you know that for a few hundredths Others envy you or love you? At the second when, triumphant You have just beaten time I know what you feel But doesn't the flush of victory Take on a trivial taste? Faced with the madness of people Who suddenly turn to you Increasingly demanding each time That they bask in your glory That they relate to your face They will change You won't You have just challenged time You know that others like before Will come to unsettle your legend Other heroes that people around the world Will celebrate in time You have just confronted time What will you do now? Will you seek other victories Within yourself Or in the mirrors that reflect you now? Will you retrace your steps For a walk in the woods On the peaceful banks of a stream Thinking of time and its mysteries? We are the ones who change It never does It never does Jean-Claude! Jean-Claude! Bravo, Jean-Claude! START FINISH Olga Pall, Austria. 1. 40. 87. 5-7. 5-9. 5-9. 5-8. 5-7. 5-7. 5-9. Thank you. Second marks. She comes from a country That counts its friends Like hard currency Putting all those who love it In an IBM machine To see who divides them When they talked of her art We couldn't help but think of dollars I'm ashamed of it now I'm ashamed of it, Peggy For a gesture We talk about it so much But we tend to forget That it has just been born This country torn apart Made of uprooted souls Trying to get to know each other Each outside their door Often offends us Of course we'll remember But they'll return one day Those forgotten rages That she swept aside With a gesture She comes from a country That counts its friends Like hard currency Putting all those who love it In an IBM machine To see who divides them When they talk of her art Some will think only of dollars I'm ashamed of it now I'm ashamed of it, Peggy For a gesture Johnny! Johnny! One more! One more! Your attention, speed up the departure, please. START FINISH Competitor number 1... First stop, number 27. One penalty. You explain, I'm sick of it!
