FRIENDS FOR LIFE Bye, Niccol?! Mario! - Huh? Don't take off the scarf before you're in school. Bye! Yes, Mom! - And don't run! Don't worry, Mom! Bye! Go ahead, everyone, go ahead, go. Hey, Camurati, hi! - Hey, hi! Sorry, ma'am, I didn't see you. Thank you. - Do sit down. Long time no see! Yes, I've been sick. - Have you heard the news? Tell me later. Come here. Someone's taken your desk. Who took my desk? - A new kid. Come in. Good morning, teacher. Sorry if I'm late, but I took the excuse to admin. Hey. Is this the Camurati you told me about? This place is mine. - Why? Because I was here. The Math teacher assigned it to me. - But now I get it back. Hop! What's going on there? Professor, look at him here! Enough, enough. Where do I sit? - Put yourself there. I don't mind losing that desk. Now, guys, we were discussing.. the more and the most. Let's take a practical example. "My book is more beautiful than yours." Have you been sick? In your throat again? - Almost. What did you have? - Mumps. In the throat? - No, it's called mumps. There, out you go. First gym, then math, and now again gymnastics. With Martinelli to boot. Sorry, but you sat on my vest. Do you know that Martinelli will replace the high school math teacher? They're in for a surprise. - Why that? - What's the matter? Guys, this jacket's ringing! What is it? - It's Petrocinetti's jacket. You're right, it's beeping. Guys, leave my jacket alone. It's a watch with chimes. It's Swiss, it's a gift from my father. Did you see? Petrocinetti has a watch that chimes. This way, just like an alarm clock, look. If I push the lever to the right, it sounds.. to the left, it stops. Can you set it for any time? - Yeah. Go a little to the blackboard.. go a little to the blackboard.. Last time.. Moretti was asked the other day.. Who is it? Good morning, teacher. We are doing the collection for the school's football squad. We depend on you guys. Out. Excuse me, professor. "The school's football squad"! So.. we said that Moretti was asked the other day.. Vargaglio is absent.. then.. go to the board.. Well? Who's doing this? Who did it? I asked who it was! It was my watch. I'm not sure why the bell was ringing. Oh, really? Then go outside. - But, Professor, I swear.. So go have fun with your watch. Professor.. - Go outside. And you, why are you laughing? You want to have some fun outside, too? Why, what did I do? Move. - I've been sick, professor. You, too? Mind your own business! - Sorry. Hey, shorty, come here! - What do you want? Come here! - Why? That's the director. If he sees us, we're toast. Look where he is. Which one's the director? - The one who is harrumphing. No one's harrumphing. And they're coming this way. Come. - Where? - Come! How much longer? - Just five minutes. Not too long. Who knows why it rang? But it rang. - Yeah, sure. If you really want to know.. I did it. Oh, really? - Yeah, in the locker room. While you were changing.. Bah, you're a cretin! - A cretin, me? You. Why did you pull this stunt? I pulled this stunt because.. because.. because you made me look ridiculous. All right? You care that much about that desk? - Fuck the desk! How come you speak English so well? I've been abroad. If you're Italian, what were you doing abroad? My father was consul first in London and then in Damascus. London? Damascus? Since you've been to London, is it certain that London.. looks better in the fog than without it? How do people get around? - With their sixth sense. It directs people home. - Who told you that? Someone, but I think it's just a fable. This is empty. Oh, no, no one's here. What are you doing here? There is another. - Hello. Listen: hundred lire for school football and we won't say a word. I paid yesterday in class. - But it was a holiday yesterday! What do you say? Does this kid also pay in class yesterday? - To be honest, I still haven't paid. Give it then at once. - I have only thousand lire. A thousand lire? Here, some bills! Didn't you say it was just 100 lire? Give me my change. Why do you want change? The fee just now rose to a thousand lire. Why mess with a new kid? Eh! - I'll keep this. What do you want, that we resort to theft? - Come on, man, come on. Did they hurt you? We going? Goodbye. And it seemed to end there. In the following days, nothing much happened. Petrocinetti and Camurati merely said hi in the morning and bye in the afternoon. But then one morning, a boring rainy morning.. Mario was offered the chance to return to his old desk, comfortable and protected. Franco was absent that day. But Mario didn't return to his old desk, who knows why. Camurati! - Hey! Make room for me under there! What are you doing here in this flood? Crazy! Let's go over there. How come you didn't come to school today? I thought you were sick. No, family reasons. - Ah, reasons! You want to know? It was the anniversary of my mother's death, I went with my father to the cemetery. She died eight years ago. Eight years ago? Ah, then you hardly remember her at all! - In fact, I remember her very well. Mine's thirty-six. Mine died when she was thirty. Shall we try? - Come on! What do we have to do for tomorrow? Then, tomorrow, Thursday, stick around, study. Hold this for a bit. Sorry to bother you with it, but I hardly know anyone else. Please! - Thank you. Imagine! Now, let us look for tomorrow.. Bring.. a Latin composition, and then.. Then, tomorrow, Thursday.. Thursday.. Thursday.. Oh, pay attention, I'll get sick again! - Sorry. Oh! Well, all right. Mathematics and English. Do you understand? - It's not much, but it's hard. - Come. Can I borrow your umbrella? - And what do I do? So come home with me! - Come with me and then I'll lend it to you. But is it far? - No, no. We've arrived. - Where? In my house. But how is this home? This is a hotel! - Here's where I live. Come on in. Excuse me a moment, please. My father hasn't returned? - No, sir. - Thank you. I'm going. Won't you please stay for five minutes? - Don't you see how I'm dressed? We'll go to the lounge. - The "lounge"? You know, we always live in hotels. My father said a hotel is much more comfortable for the life he leads. And then he gets transferred so often. Sit. - Thank you. You want something to drink? - Yes, yes, yes, thank you. I'll have the usual tomato juice. And you? The same. - Salt and pepper? - Salt and pepper. What floor are you on? - The second. Nice room? Rooms. One for my father and one for me, with the bathroom in the middle. With the bathroom in the middle? - Exactly. Is your father rich? Well.. he works in the foreign ministry. What about yours? Artist, sculptor. Ceramics, especially. A major industry. Ceramics! First for him. - Thank you. Sir. To your health. - Health. You don't like it? - It's great! You know the teacher gave us two whole chapters of the Gallic Wars? Two chapters? That'll take me all day. No, don't worry. I have the crib. The crib? What's that? - You don't know what a crib is? Have you been living in the wilderness? Look, it's all here, beautifully translated. Really? And you just copy it down? Yes, I just make some mistakes, some imperfections. But how can I give it back to you? I've already copied it, so give it back tomorrow. Young sir, you father's just arrived. He's waiting for you in the restaurant. I'll be right there. I'll walk with you. - But where are you going with me? To the exit. - Please go eat! No, no. - Go, go, please. - Well, goodbye. - Bye. Take the umbrella. - Yes, yes. Listen, why don't you stay and eat with us? Here? What, are you crazy? Listen: we can phone your home.. What? You're crazy! Well, OK, maybe another time. Goodbye. Good evening, Dad. - Hello, darling. - Please, sir. He was giving me the homework for tomorrow. Oh, is this the guy you were talking about? - Yeah. I tried inviting him to dinner. Would you have minded? No, on the contrary! So can I invite him by to study now and then? Of course. - Thanks! In fact, half an hour later, while Mario ate reheated meat.. Ah, a beautiful hotel! Just order and.. zap! They bring the tomato juice, Zap! They summon you for lunch. Zap! They bring you.. Mario, who's the young gentleman? - Who's the young gentleman? Who's the young gentleman? You are. Go answer, let's go. I already miss him at home because he's out so much. Today he ended up in a hotel! Look how it's gone to his head! Well, don't exaggerate. When I was a kid, such stuff excited me too. We are artists, in this family. - It was my friend. He wants me to drop over. Why? - To study. Listen: boys alone in the hotel, I won't allow that. But why? - Because. - But, why?! If you want to be with your friend, have him come here. Here? What's great about here? Your Mom's right, you'll see. Then I'll take him his umbrella and be right back. Take it to him at school tomorrow. But what should I tell him? That mom's afraid to send me to a hotel on my own? What if the hotel has a crook who.. zap! steals everything? Such behavior, answering back! I don't know, these kids today! They're not afraid of crooks or hotels. What next? - Here. This is the sixth trip. I'd have done better by hiring a truck. Dad, what's this? You still don't know how to read? Look what's written, here, look. Holland, Amsterdam. At last! You know why? So the Queen opens the exhibition. Imagine as the trumpets blare, "Great! By Camurati, from Italy?" "Yes, ma'am, we are." - But maybe she won't see it. - We can only hope. Put the two little boxes in the front seat, please. I hope you didn't send your Pulcinella? Why not? - Hell, no, it's ugly! It's not something to display at an international exhibition, those things! Listen, what excuse have you found for your friend at the hotel? I told him I've gotten a sore throat. - He said he's very sorry. But then what? He hung up and would not let me explain any more. Maybe he wants to become friends with you, right? - But I didn't ask him to. What does that matter whether he asks you? Is it that you don't like the idea? You clown, you! - We're ready, Mr. Luigi. This is it. Stop here. Hello. - Hello. Thank you. I was passing by and thought about dropping by. Didn't you expect me? No, I didn't. - How are you? - Well, thank you. What about your throat? - Well, it's a little better. Very interesting, this ceramic. I guess this is your factory. Yeah, sure. You want a tour? Hang on.. I'll guide your visit. Will you come, sir? - If you want to make fun, I'm going. How sensitive you are! - No, I don't want be a nuisance. - Come on, come on! Dad, this is Franco, he's come to bring me some notebooks. A pleasure, Petrocinetti. Ah, your friend from the hotel, eh? Good idea, your coming to keep Mario company. He's not quite right today, something of a sore throat. Put your hat on your head, so he doesn't give to you as well. Bye, guys. Good evening. - Goodbye, Daddy. He's nice! - Right! You can tell he's an artist. - How do you figure? I don't know.. his manner of speaking.. - Shall I show you the factory? With pleasure. - Come along. Does it bite, that dog? - Yes, but don't be afraid. This pottery's Crete-style, see? Unfortunately, the best just left for Holland. There's a ceramics exhibition. The worst ones got left behind. Wow, it looks like a documentary about a craft! But what craft? We're an industry, we have more than twenty operators! Come on, "Throat". These are the molds for Americans. A matter of millions and millions, right? This is a lathe. "Hands and feet, water and mud," as Dad says. But how is this little machine is worth millions and millions? But it's outdated Can't you see this woman hand-operates it? Let me do it. - No, leave me alone. Beat it! - Let me finish it! Lots of ashtrays! Bah, mass-produced, ready to go! Pick one, you can have it. - Thank you. Are these proverbs? - Choose a proverb. I'll take this: "Live today as if you will die tomorrow." No, that's sad, pick the yellow! It's more useful. "Guests are like fish, after three days they stink." Why is it more useful? Well, when you have a house guest dug in, you.. zap! ..put him in his place. Well, I.. I'm leaving. - Why? Look, here's the crib, and these are the English assignments. But what English? That's for tomorrow. You've given me the crib, and I.. And without errors? Listen: I lent the crib often but nobody gave me something in return. Goodbye. Is this the way out? - But where are you going? I don't know. I'll go to the hotel, to study. Is this the way out? Petrocinetti! - What? Stay here. Can't we study together? - Yes! This way. I'll give you one better, right? - Yes. But why did you bring your notebooks? In case you invited me to stay.. Let's go. Come over here. - Yes. Up the stairs. - Yes. Stop. Have you solved the problem of the unknown? No, I'll solve it right away. Well, then you do the problem and I'll do the composition. Mine, too? Yes, unless you don't want me to. What's the title of the composition? Of the two heroes Hector and Achilles, which you prefer, and why. Oh, that's easy! Start with yours. But you, which do you prefer? Hector. Hector? But surely Achilles always wins! Sure, but while Achilles was invulnerable,.. Hector instead fought with his own skill. It's an important difference. Well, tastes are tastes. But how can you write a composition preferring Hector.. if instead you favor Achilles? Who cares? I just write the opposite to my opinion. My father says I'll be a lawyer when I grow up. Then: "Under the granite walls of Troy.." "Under the granite walls of Troy.." 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Bravo! And 13, 14.. Go eat some fruit, Donatella. Alcira, come on, you have to change the tablecloth. Do you want something? - No.. It's your maid, who's working. Well, close the door, she distracts us. But haven't you ever seen a housekeeper do housework? Does it ever happen to you that something reminds you of something else? Wait, I'll try. The pencil, notebook. The notebook, then the portfolio. The portfolio: the school. - No, I'm not saying that. No, I meant that totally makes you relive certain moments.. from many years ago, for example. Ah, the memories, of course! Yes, memories are nice, dammit! Do you have fond memories? - Some. Me, when I think of mine, they always makes me laugh. You could say you've had a lucky life. No, I only remember nice things. Lucky you. - Mario, phone! - Coming! Have you done here? - Yes, ma'am. But you, when a lady enters the room, you always stand up? Yes, ma'am. Bravo! Me, my son, I've never managed to make him understand. OK, OK. Mario, who was on the phone? Oh, God! Oh, God! Dear God, dad's hurt! Oh, my God! What happened, an accident? They say it's not serious. But why didn't he call himself? God! Mom, I'm going out for a bit. OK? It's too late for going out. Be right back. - Yes, straight away..! Where are you going? I'm taking Franco to the tram. You're not telling her anything? Don't be late for dinner! - See you, ma'am! - See you! Are you going, Petrocinetti? Goodbye, Petrocinetti. You know what, he'll be all bandaged up in casts for three weeks at least! Still, he may have been lucky. With a car accident..! But what happened, a crash with someone? No, he'll have slid on the puddles because of slick tires. But, if you'd had seen how great he was, Dad! You should've seen him with his mother! No weakness, he kept his fear to himself! Yes, how brave! - He's just great! But with all that, you forgot to call me so say you'd be late, right? I.. You didn't think I'd be concerned? Please forgive me, Father. - You are forgiven. Hello? Wake me up tomorrow morning as usual at seven. Thank you. Friendship is a great feeling, but actually it grows from small things. We walk at the same pace. When one stops, the other stops. We wore the same bow tie. Look at that! - Be careful, don't push me. They come from all over Italy? - Don't you see the signs? That one's from Rome? - Who's spouting such nonsense? Listen, Camurati. - Now I'll settle this. No, but it's not the same model. For example, this one's a 4090 while that one has a fairing. But, can't you see me, asshole? You can't even ride a bike. Have you heard how brave he is? - Oh, God, now what? Nothing, we just said that you're brave. - Why, does that bother you? No, but you act like you're champion. You just confine yourself to looking. - You want to make this girl cry? Are you kidding me? What did I do to you? And you, braids girl, laugh, laugh, go ahead! What do I have to do? Yes, I know, I know you have to do. And get those braids trimmed! Golden Braids! Golden Braids, braids girl! Give them as a gift to your mama, go on! But what made you go off on Fenoccio? - Nothing, I guess. Then tell me why she was laughing. Because I said that I can ride a motorbike. You know how to ride? Yeah, sure. - But I don't. Is that a sin? You're right, no. All because of that damn badge! - What badge? A badge given to me by an officer who participated in the bike race in Naples. Is that a beggar or a street musician? Try to give a him a tip, see if he accepts.. He's a beggar. So the girls realized..? Fenoccio introduced me to her cousin with a bike, and I wouldn't ride it. And that upset you? Listen: When girls make fun of me, it bothers me. Listen, do you want to learn? To ride a Vespa? No, what do I care about a bike? Tomorrow you must show off to that girl there. You'll want to make a good impression! Do you understand? Courage, Camurati, someone like you can learn immediately! You just have to prove it, dammit! 3, 4. 1, 2, 3,..Left turn. Ready for the second drill? Begin. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hey, it's time? Why, you believe him? If Camurati said he'd pass by, he means it. But there's no one there. It's the right time. Forget it. Come on, courage! - Come on, forget it! Are you kidding? You have to prove it to that girl there. Mount up. No, I'm tired. I was kidding. It's very easy, courage, I'll help. Do you understand? Don't touch anything. And don't go down to the main street. Don't touch the throttle! Watch the tree! There he is. He's coming. He showed! Courage, Camurati! He's so brave! On this side. Bravo, you're a champion! Pass by once again! One minute, pass by again! So he was a liar? You know full well he doesn't know how to ride a motorbike. But who cares, or was it me who said it? - Camurati is passing by! Stop, pull on the brakes! Now you've become a hero. Tomorrow tell me how much you paid, so I can pay you back. Don't sweat it. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Listen, Franco! Thank you, Franco. Goodbye. - Goodbye. A Carnival Sunday Franco is, as usual, spending the afternoon at Mario's. Hey, I brought the model, with the gun turret. How much did you pay? - 4000 lire. - How do I look? - Fine. I just need the hair gel. - You look better messy. Then I'll rough it up. - Always in front of the mirror, you! Good morning, ma'am. - Hi, dear. Daddy, Daddy! Can I lend the yellow-red badge? Can't you see I'm working? Take care of his behaviour. Have fun. Mario, be careful not to return too late, you've got school tomorrow. Don't eat too much cake. Come here, Mario, you're all messy! Give them our regards. What's this badge? - The Motorcycle Association. What.. are you already a member? - No, but I wear it when I go to parties. What party? - Fenoccio's, right? Bye, mom. Bye, dad! - See you, ma'am! Fenoccio? - It's her birthday. Didn't she phone you? - No. How couldn't she have phoned? She phoned me this morning and told me she's inviting everybody. I didn't get phoned. Well, what does it matter? - I'm not going where I haven't been invited. Well, I'm inviting you! - But how? Sure, I'll tell her that I've invited you. I'm not going where I haven't been personally invited. So why did you come to my house? You told me to do so, we had plans. We were going to build a model. A model? - But don't worry about me. Goodbye. Hey, Franco! You know what I'm saying? I'm not going to the party, I'm with you! I don't want any trouble. Go to the party. I won't go back to your place. So you know what we'll do? Let's go out together. Oh! But swear you don't mind. And, what of the party? Imagine, there'll just be four stupid people there! Let's go! Where are we going? We've been doing this for two hours. We go to the movies every Friday. - Let's go play ping pong. You always win and I lose! Should we go that way? - I don't care. Just look! This is the last straw! What is it? This is Fenoccio's place! Oh, really? - Yes, yes, exactly. Look, one meandering walk, and look where we end up! Ah, the streets..! Is this different somehow? And why not! You know we've even draw flowers on the stairs? She's very playful, she is! Since you're here, why don't you go? - Go in? What, are you kidding? But if they look out the window, what'll they make of you? Yeah, if they look out the window, what'll they make of me? What should I do? What, you've come alone? - I'm going home. No. If you won't wait I won't go in. I'll do a quick in-and-out. All right. - Thanks! Wait for me! Wait for me! A quick in-and-out. - Yes, yes. Hello. - Hello. Will you give me your coat? - No, no, no. Thank you. Thank you very much. Adriana, look what the Colonel did! - Good evening, ladies. Ah, good evening, ma'am! - Hello, dear. Margherita's over there. Stop, stop! What are you up to? Stop! Now what's your grandfather up to? Is he nuts? - And what can I do? And here, the final surprise from Grandpa Fenoccio! You like it? Careful, please don't touch the tower! You can look but don't touch the tower! - All right, all right! You came, eh? - Yes. Happy birthday. Thank you. - Hello, sorry. Who's that? - A cousin from Switzerland. Excuse me, miss. - Do you want something? - No, thank you. You cut your hair, huh? Yes, so you won't call me braid-girl anymore. I don't much like it. You have a new tie? - Yes. You like it? No. - Well.. I must go. - Why? Because my friend's waiting for me. - Have your friend come in. Do I know him? It's Petrocinetti! But you didn't invite him, but you'll have him in? I didn't know the name of the hotel where he stays. - I'll call him right away. Guys, Petrocinetti's down there! - Guys, everyone get in the party! Hello! I can come up? Come, Franco, c'mon! Run, come on, come on! Third floor, apartment seven! That's good! Indeed you seem to be Petrocinetti's friend! - Sure. Why? Good evening. Hello. A pleasure. Camurati. - And who's this? - A schoolmate. Is your mom here? - Yes, over there. - And those folks, who are they? He's my cousin. He enrolled in college this year. But you, how many cousins do you have? - Heaps! And she's his fiancee. Yes, it shows. Guess what? They got engaged last week, officially. They'll get married soon. They're already thinking about getting married? What do you want? They've known each other for so long! They've always been together in school. Like us. Have you done the Latin composition? - What? Sure. Yes, I did it this morning. I was done by seven. It's easy, but.. Now, with your hair cut, are you cold about the ears? - Oh, yes. That's Franco! This is Franco! Franco, hello! I've got you in, right? - Are there many people? Well, yes, quite a few. - Hello. Oh, hello, happy birthday! - Sorry if I didn't phone, but.. Please! - Will you present me to your mother, please? Yes, meanwhile, come through here. - I'll introduce you myself. Mario, you know.. that mama has kept my braids? - Oh, really? Hello, Petrocinetti! What are you doing, Margherita? And you, who are you? Mario Camurati. - Ah, Mario Camurati, Mario Camurati..! Listen, is my tie really so ugly? It's no big deal. Do you recognize this? - Yes. Beautiful. - Mom said she'll keep it for a lifetime. What are you doing? Well.. for the memory. - Ah, yes. Give it to me, I'll put it in a box. Hey, kid! Who are you? - Camurati, Mario. - Mario! But a memory of what? - What do you mean, "a memory of what"? Ah, yes. - Guys, uh, guys! We're doing a choir there. A choir? Coming. A chorus! I'm all disheveled. Mario! The box. - Oh, thank you! And there we were, us two fools with braids in our hands as well! And you know, when hair is attached to the head, it looks fine. But when they cut it, it has an effect, really! So why did you take it? And what should I have done? You know what? When you do certain things, it means your becoming an adult. But they're cute, right? - Cute, yes. Want some? - No. Come on, no problem, take some, come on! So, if you'd like, you'd do the wise guy, too. I don't care about Fenoccio's hair. - Oh, sorry! But why? Some loyalty to your own heartthrob? What? Maybe you already have one, and haven't told me! Why? - Because you're the type who keeps secrets. Hey, do you have one! Even if I had, I wouldn't tell you. Come on, Come. But aren't you my friend? Me? - Yes, you. And, why? Because I've told you everything about Margherita, but you, nothing. At least tell me her name. - What name? Franco, come here. Look, if you don't tell me at least her name, I'll break up with you. What do you want? Leave me alone. So you won't tell me? Maddalena. Ah, finally! And is she a blonde? Come quick, come on, it's almost eight. Where is she? - Far off. - Where? She's.. on the Via Appia. On the Via Appia? What is she, an American? But is she better than Margherita? What school does she go to? She's always at home. - At home? Tell me about this. But what? - You already said on the Via Appia, but where? In a mansion.. out front the entrance has two marble lions. Two marble lions? So is this true? Yes, it's true. And she.. what's she like? Huh? - Go on! Is she beautiful? Ah, yes, she's beautiful! - More than Margherita? She's very different. But beautiful.. beautiful, how? Is she a fox? Beautiful like.. like Ingrid Bergman. - Ingrid Bergman? Yes, but with black hair. - Wow! Is that a four-engined? Must be a Constellation. - To me it's a 16. That's a Constellation. - But how can you tell? I hear it. - Yes, at this distance, you hear it. You bet it's a Constellation. Well, you know better. It's switching on its landing lights. Green, red, green, red, black, blue, yellow, white. But what are you saying? - It's challenging me. To me, when night comes and it's dark, it makes me say so. One fine day it became known that Petrocinetti had a passion for horses. What a round! Dad, Mario's arrived. Can I go? - Go, go. Inevitably, Camurati became passionate for horses as well. Hey, Mario! - Come here! Come here! Are you happy? - I can't, come here! - I'm with my father. I can't go past the fence. Look, I have so much to do, and I should waste time on horses? But friendship knows no barriers. But, don't you know that everyone who comes here gets their name in the paper? Yes, in the police blotter. Who told you that nonsense? Franco said so, in the reception they listed those invited. Hello, sir. - Hello. - Hello! How far along are we? - It's almost over. Damn! Did you see? We're late. I mustn't miss my call from Holland. - But why didn't you just call them? I tried, but they didn't answer the phone. What position is this? - The final round. It's the most important. - What a relief! The Italian's riding, look, he's the one with the military uniform! He's at the third obstacle. - Let me see! Go for it! Go on! Hey, you look, too Bravo! Seven. Eight. Now let me see. Viva Italy! - Viva Italy! Good morning. Franco, is that your father? - Yeah, that's my dad. Oh, of course. Good morning. Franco, come along. Look out, he's calling you. - I'm going with them. Oh, are you going with them? I'll walk with him, see you at the exit. And so Camurati's dad and Petrocinetti's dad came to know each other. Bye, Mom. - Didn't you eat breakfast this morning? No, just some bread and butter. - Have some milk! - No, it's late, goodbye! But what's this new stuff? Come here. - But mommy, it's late! What are you wearing? Are you wearing your new clothes for school, are you? Go put them off immediately. - Come on, let me go, I'm late. What the hell's going on? Nothing, he'll be late. Mario's wearing his new clothes! - Shut up! Ah, Mario, yes, come here, come here. Donatella, aren't you ashamed of spying? You're a bad girl, go immediately to the corner! Close the door. Such music! Listen, listen! What did you come up with this morning? I've put on new clothes. - New clothes, yes! You see? This is old. These are old clothes because I've been working here for two hours. Understand? Like you, when you go to school, you're working! When I was your age, I walked with a patch on my butt, you know? But not this gentleman, this gentleman has to go to school in a new suit! But I put it on when I want! - And now you'll take it off! You take it off immediately. Got it? Hello, Camurati. I said hello. - Hello. But what got up your nose? Petrocinetti, they're closing the gates! - I'm coming! Hey, they've half closed the gate. I told you I'm not going to school. Sorry, but at least tell me why not. Because.. why not. Today everyone's against me, that's why. Goodbye. - Goodbye. But what do you do? Go, you! - I'm not going to school without you. But don't you see that they're closing the gate? Ah. - "Ah". And run! TODAY.. OPEN.. 4 PM. What can I see now? Excuse me, but does this also open in the morning? It's been closed for two months. Because only students like you used to come in. Guys, it's raining! Hold off, cloud! This is serious! - Oh, boys, let's go! It's better back in the dugout. Do you have room left? - No. Have you made a donation? No. - Then turn off the candle. Ma'am, what if you light the candle without paying, what happens? Don't you have a conscience? Listen! Could you tell me the time? Could you tell me the time, please? - Huh? - The time. Yeah, right away. It's ten to one. - Ah, thanks. It looks like Franco's watch. Where are we, in a horse show? Me, come out! Get out! If you really want to know, I did it. You're a cretin! - Cretin? Who? Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman. Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman. Ingrid Bergman?? With black hair. Holy shit! She's always at home. Bloody hell! What's she like, beautiful? More than Margherita? What's she like, is she beautiful? - More than Margherita! A mansion with two lions. Two marble lions! Hey, young sir, what is it? Do you want something? I was just looking around. What were you looking for? Nothing, a lady who lives here. A lady? - One such Maddalena. - And who's she? She lives here, right? - There's no Maddalena here. But the owners, aren't they here? - I don't know. I'd been told that.. Even yesterday some people came asking to rent, but it's not for rent. But how, is this home for rent? Listen, how long have the owners been away? They told me it's been eight years. Ever since the owner's wife died. The owner, who is he? He's a gentleman. He's always abroad. He's an ambassador. Ambassador? But don't they have a daughter? No, I think there's just a boy. Could they be named Petrocinetti, by any chance? Yes, why, do you know them? - Petrocinetti! You don't understand why he did it, but what does that matter? But what can you do? He hasn't been seen all morning. Hello. - Hello. Can you tell us what happened to you? - Let's get away, there are teachers. Anything new in school? - We had to read a composition in class. Were lots of kids missing? - Four or five, including you. What did you do this morning? Huh? Nothing, I just went to the cinema. - What did you see? Rubbish. But did they give you a lot of algebra? No, not too much. Hang on. I'll tell you for sure. What will you do tomorrow about an absence excuse? You know, it's not true I went to the movies. - Well, then? You know where I've been? No. Where? If I tell you, you won't get upset? - And why should I get upset? To the Via Appia. The Appian Way! The Via Appia? And why? I've seen your house. It was cool, looking for your Maddalena! Oh! Franco! Franco, come on! Franco! - Leave me alone! Franco! - Go! - But what's come over you? Come here! Franco, come here! Franco. What's the matter? What did I say? After all, what have I done? Nothing. Close the door. What do you mean, "nothing"? You run off, you take offense! What should I say? Forgive me! If I knew it was so complicated, I never would have mentioned it to you. I've been in your home. Such a dose you've given me! It wouldn't make any difference. I was lying.. But, so much pain, over a mere fantasy! I lie too. Remember the Vespa. But you just lied to a girl.. but, I lied to you. Does it come with springs? But what's the difference? Is it British? - Yes. - Ah, English-type suspension. Great. Your father gave it to you? It runs very well. "Dear Mario: I am writing to tell you.." And what's this? A letter for me? No. - What did you want to tell me? Nothing. - But why haven't you finished it? Oh, that letter there! Give it to me, give it to me! You've written it to me, let me read it! "Mario, I've lost you forever. "I've made myself the wise guy by inventing Maddalena.. "who has never existed, but I just want you to know.. "I've done it exclusively for our friendship,.. "so you would consider me worthy of being your friend.." Oh! Oh! What's all this about being worthy? What's this thing of being worthy about? You have Fenoccio but I don't have anyone. You don't get it, she's no more than two hairs to me. But is it that you care so much about girls? No! But I was afraid that you'd laugh at me. Me? Mock you? Franco! You know what I mean? To me you're even more worthy than before! All right? And yes, because you sent me to the Via Appia, on a phony mission.. to tease me. You've been spontaneous, you have! It's spontaneity that counts today, and you're spontaneous! Very spontaneous! And that's part of becoming a man. Do you understand? Come on, give it up. I actually think you're nicer than before. OK? Stop it, come on. Franco, eh, Franco! Come on, let's not be stupid! Come on, come on! You've made a fool of me, you did it! Mario! You forgot the homework. - Oh, thank you! Mario. - Huh? You, at the mansion.. did you go in? But what, are you crazy? Breaking into someone else's house? Eh.. Well, I did look at a room through the window. The lounge. But how well do you remember your old house? I always I have it in my mind. Don't worry. Even when I write, I always write about things I know. Bye. Listen, Mario. Did you think they have it in order? You don't know you, when you're the owner..!? But I.. it's been so long since I've been back there at all. Why? Because.. my mother died there. Oh, I see, it scares you. No, but we were so happy there, so close together.. then.. I haven't had the courage to return. Yes, I understand. Goodbye. - Listen! - Huh? But I'd like to go back with you. With me? - Yes. You'll come with me? This waiting room is nice. It's homey, right? But it's all dusty. We should come to play ball sometime! But it's so long since anybody came here at all! It's so underused! Imagine that as a kid I wanted to come here just to play the piano! Look, it opens here. Listen, it sounds great! We need some light! This won't open. I'll draw back the shutter. Franco, Franco! Why are you afraid to look at the picture? My mom was beautiful, right? Franco, Franco! What are you doing? Take my handkerchief. Oh, Franco! Don't cry, come on, don't cry, come on! Listen, can we make an oath? - Sure. Let's swear not to tell anyone what has happened. Yes, yes, we won't tell anyone, that's a solemn oath! Franco, Franco! Here's a toad! Where is it? - Just here, but it's dead! Don't crush it. - And who's touching it? It doesn't move. Is it dead? - Yes, yes, totally dead. Spring arrives and the friendship continued in the usual way. The only thing noteworthy.. was that Margherita Fenoccio,.. on having been seen many times talking to one of the third F.. who only had a bike, and that even without an engine.. was thus considered unworthy of further consideration. And it was established by agreement, of course,.. to stop any kind of confidential relation with her. Otherwise, things were as usual. Until one evening.. Hello, Camurati here. Oh, OK, Miss, I'll wait. Is it your girlfriend? - No, the lady at the Hotel. Ah, your girlfriend's in the hotel! Hurry! I have an important call. Hello, Franco, yes? But hey, enough! No, not you, I'm talking to Dad. But what, you're crying? What's happened? Immediately? OK, I will. Yes, yes, I'll be there immediately. Where are you going? - To see Franco. But, my son, you saw him not 15 minutes ago! But dad he told me we have to talk! - But you'll see him at school. Right? Dad, he was crying! I'm sure something's happened! What could've happened? - I'm sure, Dad! Franco, hello! Oh, just for two minutes, please. We must separate. Our friendship is over. Explain! What's happened? I have to leave, maybe forever! - Must you go? Are you going very far away? - Dad's been transferred to the Sudan. You're leaving immediately? I don't know, at any time. But I don't want to, I don't want to leave! Stop it, you'll go with your father. Yes, but there's no school for foreigners there. I must go back to the school where I was for the past three years. To the boarding school. Mario..! Why am I so unlucky? So unfortunate! But tell your father! But what does he have to do with it? It's not his fault. It's my fate who has played me false. Excuse me, sir. You can't stay here. Yes, I know, just a minute, because I'm waiting on those two gentlemen there. Yes, sir, but you can't stay here. Just a moment! Coming! Excuse me, sir, but you can't honk here. - OK, I'm sorry. Bring the car, excellency, I'll guide you. Come, come along. Yes, now park carefully. A little more, a little more.. Was it at least something important? If it wasn't important I wouldn't have come. Stop the car, I'll take care to park it for you. Thank you, sir, thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Here, talk to this man. What do you want? I'd like to talk to consul Petrocinetti. - Your name, please. - Camurati. Do you have an appointment? - Yes. - Pass. This one is aimed at the Brazilian embassy, concerning maritime policy. Come in! Mr. Camurati. - Who? - Mr. Camurati. Ah, yes! Bring him in.. Hey, Mario! Excuse me a moment. Sorry. Sit. Double spaced, and it bring it to me to sign, Miss. Thank you. So.. this is the first time I got a letter from a friend of my son. So, then, you say it's about important matters. Furthermore, you've written that they are "very, very important." What I can offer? Oh, God, here only cigars! But I hope you don't smoke. No, thanks. - Some orange juice? No, thanks. - Something from the bar? No, no thanks. So let's start this talk. Well, what is it? Business? Here I am all ears. This is.. this is about Franco. Franco? - Yes. - Has something happened? No! He came.. he came here with me. Here? And where is he? Out front. Out front? - Yes. But has something happened to him? - No! He doesn't want to leave. He doesn't want to go to that school. He doesn't want to leave. Yes, I know. I know he doesn't want to go back to that school. But what I can do? I can't have him with me down there. No, it's better to have him go to a school that I already know.. even if it's not close to my residence. Excuse me, son. Yes? OK, Miss. Make me a copy and send it to the ceremony. We've been left on our own and we only have each other left. Leave him here! - Here, where? - With me! Sure.. you! Bravo! You really are a great guy! - I love Franco. My father agrees, so does my mother. But he would be a burden to your family. No, no! My father can phone you tonight. So, Mr. Consul, will you let him? But there's no hurry, I'm not leaving immediately. However, as of today, you'll be in charge of Franco. Yes! - Thank you. Good morning, good morning. Good day to you. - Good morning. Camurati residence? Good morning. Petrocinetti. How are you? Are you? Good. Can you hear me? Right? Sorry for annoying you, but I've just seen Mario. Yes, he just left. Ah! You did know? But then this is for real. I thought it was something the kids cooked up between themselves. Then came the big sporting event. Attention, kids, form two lines! Pay attention to me. Attention. Within twenty days begins the student cross country racing championship. Representatives from all the middle schools of Rome will take part. Raise your hand if you want to participate. No! Now what, everybody? Then I'll decide. The selected muster over there please. One, two, three, four. Not you, you're too small. Five. This guy, Professor! - All right, go. Franco, hello! - Hello! Mario! - Good morning, ma'am. Put on your jacket, and don't run! - Stay calm, Mom. The car's all set? Hello, Niccol?. - Good morning, young sir. You want me to wait in front of the school? - Yes. Ready and.. go! Petrocinetti and Camurati didn't go even one meter at a normal pace. After a few days of training they obtained the best result. On the long distance from Mario's house to Giuseppe Mazzini Middle School.. they reached the goal of the first hour of lessons.. Three and a half minutes late. To your desks. Truly satisfying result. Now let's try the first lap. - Right. Keep time. - All right. They also familiarized themselves with the route.. a mile with a drop-off and a tunnel at the beginning,.. and a small exit at the end. Mario ran with a handkerchief in his mouth like Dorando Pietri. And then they took turns leading, as they say in sports terms,.. pacing each other. The impressive participation of competitors.. made necessary many elimination rounds. Athletes were divided by alphabetical groups,.. and only the top three from each group qualified participate in the final. Franco Camurati and Mario Petrocinetti, one of the letter C, and one of the P,.. ran in two different heats,.. and so they were able to cheer each other to win. Mario won his heat, predictably. For Franco, however, things were a little more difficult. It fell on him to compete with 24, and another, number 5. 24, a huge one, had hairy legs that were scary,.. the kid wearing the 5, a bespectacled little twerp, seemed like nothing.. surprisingly, showed a pace akin to Zatopek. It was fate that Franco also was to enter the final. What is it? - Camphor oil. If you want to get massaged, get on your bed. My bed? - Yes, yours. I brought it here for when you come to live here. Right? We'll stay in the kitchen, or we can bring a sofa so at night we can talk better. Will we talk at night? - That is cute! What do the soldiers do in the barracks? - Are you done here? Go to your rack, there's the race tomorrow, and don't talk anymore. Did you eat? - Yes, ma'am. Mom, the dresser's missing? - Yeah. It's in the basement. This will fit here to perfection. So you'll put everything you want over it. The photograph of your father, notebooks, pictures of Maddalena. Ah, but you can't take a joke! So what about the massage? - Yes, yes, yes, come on, come on. What mystery, chemistry! Who knows why it makes camphor moths ugly, but instead it relieves us. You know what I was thinking? - What? Tomorrow you and I will be competing. Who, me and you? - Yes. But what do you mean? - Nothing. So what? Sports are one thing, and friendship's another. Just thought I'd mention it. You know what I think, instead? - What? That tomorrow I'd like to break last year's record. Sorry, it's one thing to win a race, and another to set a record. Yes. - I think last year's was 5:27. Right? If I start ahead of everyone and get to the finish line before the rest. I'll do maybe 5:23, or even 5:22. Ready! Set? Force, Camurati, strength! Beware of falling, watch out! Have you seen Camurati this morning? - Sure, sure, take it easy! It is on this side. - Who has already seen Camurati? He's in the tunnel, in the tunnel! Camurati, Camurati, don't force yourself! Mind your wind, slow the pace! Be more regular, Camurati, control your breathing! I can't go any farther! Strength, Mario! - No, I can't, I can't! Finish. Who's ahead? - Some little kid! Hey! - Hey! Lots of people! Huh? Have you ever seen such stupid face? He may be stupid but he ran better than other 200 guys! Don't you get it? But he did that on purpose to be outdone! But he looked like Zatopek! What happened to you in the race yesterday? Forget it, forget it. The newspaper, the newspaper! "In other matters: yesterday was held the finals" "of the student cross country racing championship." Aren't you interested? Did it mention me, by any chance? Well, for what it says.. listen. Let's look a bit. Twenty: Carburati, Mario. Someone made a mistake in the name! "Then, after an exciting run, the winner was Petrocinetti, Franco" "Giuseppe Manzzini Middle School" "the very young athlete who clinched the victory with a strong race presence" "and who set the record of five minutes, twenty seconds." "These guys surely are the promises for tomorrow." You will be a promise never fulfilled. But do you want to get the hell out? Oh, sorry, are you envious? - Hear how you change! Go ahead, don't give up, Petrocinetti, I'm worn out! But who's worn out? - You. You'd better not make fun of him. - Why not? Was there anything outside the rules? - Yes, Petrocinetti has another girlfriend! Well, OK, then I'll tell you. We agreed. We were supposed to support each other, to eliminate the rest. Instead.. I was left alone.. and when he saw that I couldn't go anymore, he left, he deserted me. You poor dear! Word of honor. You don't really know Petrocinetti. He's very spontaneous, him! Think about something else, Camurati! He's made fun of everybody, he's mocked you all. If I told you, of course you'd laugh if I told you! Then spit it out! What did he tell you? Hello! Hey, by the way, listen to what he told me. Once, we were talking confidentially he told me:.. "I have a girlfriend named Maddalena". Maddalena, who's she? He says she looks like Ingrid Bergman. - Have you seen her? Petrocinetti. - Good morning, teacher. You overslept this morning, I think. No, I've been in the Secretariat. Family reasons. What reason? My father's leaving today, so I'm moving house tonight. Oh, yeah? I heard that you did well yesterday. Bravo! Good lesson. - Good lesson, professor. Good morning, teacher! - Good day, Petrocinetti! How brave! - Did you see? Enough now, guys. Sit. Quiet. Margherita, please go close the door and clean the board. Mario, Mario! Mario! I must tell you something urgently. I don't understand. Petrocinetti. Petrocinetti, what are you doing? Present. I don't understand. Petrocinetti, calm down. Later. Bring the grammar book. Page 64. Let me read! - Give me the letter! Pass. The Dean has asked me to say that next Sunday will be a school trip to Anagni. Anagni is a very interesting city to visit,.. that has nevertheless retained its medieval character and, above all, has a beautiful cathedral.. Hey, let me see! Give it to me! Give it here, give it to me here, the letter! What is it? Now, pay attention, because today I'll explain the use of the dative. Take it. - Who from? Letter for you, read, read! "To Franco, on the day of the victory from his beloved, Maddalena the Ugly." I want to go home. - But why, you just arrived? I don't feel well. Let me go home. - But, what's the matter? Tell me. No, I don't know, I feel bad, suddenly, let me go home, ma'am. Okay, go. Remember, to make sure you get the principal's permission. - Yes, ma'am. But what are you doing? - Well, but listen a bit, are you really sick? Yes, ma'am. - Want me to get you escorted home? No, no, I want to go home. I remind you, get the principal's permission, OK? - Yes, ma'am. Well, no more distractions. Now another example of dative of possession. For example: I have a beautiful book. In Latin it translates to me is a beautiful book. Like this:.. No, he's not. Ah, the bell just rang! Wait a minute, it should be him. Look, it's your friend on the phone. Didn't you see each other in school today? - Yes, Mom. So don't delay, the soup is ready. What did you cook today? - Soup. Soup? What soup? - Risotto. Oh, good! - But surely you don't like risotto! Hello, it's me. Hello. - I wanted to say only one thing: You're a coward and a traitor! Oh, Franco! - Goodbye. Enjoy. - Thank you. You know what's in this telegram? The result of the exhibit in the Netherlands. We sold a lot. Even the Pulcinella, you know? The one according to your judgment was not suitable for an international exhibit. But what's wrong? Nothing. - What do you mean, "nothing"? Don't you feel well? I've fought with Franco, all right! Why? Because he's a jerk, angry over nothing. Holy crap! Did we already set up the dresser? - Yes, it's already in your room. Morini. - Present. - Velizzi. - Present. Petrocinetti. - Absent. Garcia. - Present. - Rosatti. - Present. Petrocinetti is absent again. He probably went to Maddalena. Hush, hush. Today we design guards. We begin by drawing.. Come in. The orthogonal axes. Good afternoon, Professor. - Good afternoon, secretary. Here's a memo from management. Quiet, guys! Tell me. Should I turn on the light? - Yes, thank you. Petrocinetti has left school. Therefore we'll draw orthogonal axes. We'll begin by learning the section of the capital. Petrocinetti, wasn't he that blond guy who came when the term already began? Yes, Teacher! - One who moved from England! The guy living in the hotel Braschi. - He has left. - Left? Yes, back to England. - Have you been told he's back in England? OK, OK, calm, calm. Moving on.. Is there a piece of chalk to continue? - I'll get a piece of chalk, teacher! Yeah, sure, but make it quick. We said.. Hello. Hotel Braschi? Mr. Petrocinetti, please. Not the father, the son, the young gentleman. Hello, Franco? Ah, sorry. Has the consul left? The son? Ask, please. Camurati! Oh, were you phoning? - You know I am. Where's the chalk gotten to? Here we are. Come on. Maybe these will do. They put the phone just for you, for you to use as you will. It's all your fault! But what are you saying? - Yes. Franco, come here. Want to call him? You're really upset by having to leave with me, right? - No, Dad. I haven't asked you anything, not a thing, my child. You should be the one to speak. Dad, will it be long before we go? I don't know, at least the time required for customs and passports. Yes, Dad. I'm in the hotel. They're gone. Huh? The consul called? He said he was very grateful? What do I do, Dad? No, I'm not coming home, Dad! It already departed from Zebra Square. - But the bus doesn't leave from here? I told you already, the bus leaves from Zebra Square. - Ah, thanks. Thank you. Doesn't this car go to the airport? - No, that's a courier truck. This heads for Ciampino. I'm not running away from home. I swear! I want to see this friend who's leaving. By now he should have left. How are you planning to see him? But let's go faster! Faster! Listen, can't it happen that a plane is delayed? Well.. sometimes it happens. I'll drag him out of the plane, I will! - Bravo, drag him out. I would like to see what he says now. Tell me a little, this friend of yours, is he leaving because you had a fight? Well, that's how he is. What do you want? It's like I gave birth to him. He's just a baby. He always makes this grin, just like this, with his mouth. He's the son of an important person, Petrocinetti. The Consul Petrocinetti. Do you know him? You'll meet him. I'll drag him off and we'll end up at home together, then. He was supposed to come sleep with me, tonight. But what did you do to him? Me? Nothing! - Really nothing? How dark it is around here! Please, sir. Ms. Lester, Mr. Sanzollini, Mr. Dimitros, Mr. Petrocinetti and son. Franco, come on. - Yes, Dad. Franco! But what are you doing? You're leaving? You can see I'm going. I hurried to catch you! Why are you leaving, because of me? Let's not talk about that. - But what have I done to you? I haven't done anything to you. Have I? I never meant to hurt you! - They're waiting for me. I've been a fool, that's what! I made you mad for nothing! Then we won't see each other again? Don't go, Franco! Don't be a jerk! Come on, don't go!
