But this isn't a fairy tale, and Christmas is a horseshit holiday that makes us all feel like crap and reminds us of what's wrong in our lives. That's why I'm here. Welcome back, KLDA listeners. I'm Emily Harris and you're listening to "Ask Emily." Oh, it looks like we have time for one more sad Christmas caller who needs my help. Hi, you're on the line with Emily. What's your name, and what's your problem? Uh, hi. My name is Greg and I have sort of an awkward question. Awkward. Mm, that's my specialty. Lay it on me. My girlfriend's parents have been calling me Craig for two years, but it's Greg. Do I correct them? - Yes, you correct them! Also, real quick, if the holidays isn't the time to get a little passive-aggressive, then I don't know when is. Greg, here's what you're gonna do. You're going to go out and get yourself a custom Christmas sweater with your actual name, Greg, front and center. Oh, my God, that's genius. Can I write, "No one likes your fruitcake" on the back? Fruitcake? You talking about fraudcake? Yeah, you write that too, on the back in lights... Out of my chair, Harris. - Uh... one, test, test. - Who's this? Uh, that's the new intern, and we're just testing the audio. It sounds great. Yeah, whatever. Listen. Queue up that new music I sent you this morning. It totally sings. Yeah, you got it.

Well, there'll be no avoiding tonight, because tonight's the big night. Yeah. Em, you know Ken is deciding tonight on who's taking over his slot, okay? You got to strap on your boss pants and pitch him "Ask Emily" tonight at the Christmas party. - Mm-hmm. - Right? He's never gonna know that you want to be a DJ unless you tell him. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. So what's your plan? Oh, I was hoping you would ask. So my plan is to keep all my wishes to myself, so I'm never embarrassed or disappointed. See you tonight, coward. And don't forget to wear your sparkly dress. I would never forget to wear my sparkly dress. No. You gave the kid a LEGO Tokyo Skyline. Uh, yeah. He asked for a scooter! Okay, I did that kid a favor, all right? And if he had any taste, he would know that. Do you know how many complaint letters we've gotten about you? You know how the big man feels about being selfish. He is not happy, so here's what we're gonna do. We are assigning you to the Lost Souls Department. No! Lost Souls? Nah, nah, nah, I'm not good with talking with people. Mm, you don't say. No, I don't like people like that, okay? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - I can't... I can't do it. So here's what you're gonna do. You are going to work with, listen to, and actually help your assigned human, and learn not to be so selfish. Or you are getting reassigned to work for...

I thought we were both wearing our sparkly dresses. I had a dry cleaning emergency. But, a little sparkle. There. Now we look exactly alike. - Exactly. - We're like Tia and Tamera. Ladies! Nice to see you. Shouldn't I be wearing that crown? Why is that, Janice? Because you're the queen of kissing Ken's ass? It's obvious Ken's gonna name me his replacement. Okay, we all know how you got your job, Janice. You give your knee pads a rest tonight? Oh, good one. You should know by now that I get everything I want, okay? Cute dress, though. I like the zipper. It's cute. Ugh. No, I know, I know, I know. I'm gonna ask Ken. I will. I'm gonna ask him, but, like... Look, for now let's just concentrate on getting really drunk, really fast. Yes, oh, yes. Right here. - Focus on that. - Hi. Hey, hi. - Ah! - And to boobs. Both: Ugh! It's in the throat, you know what I mean? Just like, mm. OMG. It's the hot IT guy. He's standing there at the buffet. Alone. Hey! Not for long. Hold this. Hey. Emily! Fun party. Thank you, you look... Oh, you didn't say... - What? - Nice sweater. - Thank you. - Yeah. I... uh-oh, mistletoe. Hmm. You know, maybe we should... Uh, do you... you don't have a cat, right? Because cats are allergic to mistletoe, so... Stay alert, stay alive. Bye! Bye. Come on, Emily, spit it out. Just say it. You say something? Ken, I was, um... It's just that I know that... Ken, what I want you to... I've had to pee all night, you know? Good to know. - Hey, what happened? - I don't know. I don't know what happened. I just... like, how do people do this? Like, I know I'm supposed to ask Ken for the on air job, and I choked. And I know I'm supposed to try to make out with the hottie under the mistletoe, and I choked at that too. And it just feels like all of my words get stuck in my throat, and I can't... Like, what do you do... How do you do... How does anyone do any of this? I just feel like every single thing I do is so wrong. Hey, um, can I have a nogtini, please? Sorry. That guy got the last of them. Love nogtinis. Gosh. Cheers. That butt-kissing Janice got my nogtini? She ain't getting my job. Not at all. I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna... I'm gonna demand it, and I'm... I'm... here I go. Emily, you're still standing here. My feet. All right, let's do this. Okay everyone, hey, come on. Gather round, gather round. Listen up. So I was gonna do this after the holiday, but hell, it's Christmas. Anyway, we figured out who's gonna replace me. It's gonna be Janice. As you can imagine, the choice was clear. So get ready for "The Dish with Janice"! There you go! Let's dance. Here we go. - Boo! - Boo. I already hate your show. You're the only one not dancing. Where's your Christmas spirit? Santa, mind your business, okay? Also, you have never brought me anything I've ever asked for. Well, why don't you put it in a letter then, drunky? Oh, you gonna go with him. Real supportive. Hey, can you, um... Can you give me something to make me forget tonight? Try that. Thank you, but keep them coming. - You got it. - Mm, mm. Yeah. - Pure elf's blood. - Oh, mm. Nah, you acting shy.

Santa doesn't grant you anything. He didn't grant me my job, and I want to... look at her! She got my job. How'd they get that up so quick? And I didn't even get to make out with the IT guy! When's the last time you make out with somebody, hm? You can't be here without kids. Oh! All of a sudden, I ain't got a kid. I can't have a baby? I have a child, and his name... It's Timothy. - You're drunk. - You're drunk! And his name is Thomas, and he would really appreciate... So I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna get... Excuse me? Sis, I will not. That way!

Okay. Okay, well, now y'all are close physically. - That's not what I meant! - I know. Santa is a literal son of a bitch. Actually, is this your boy here? Tell your boy to take it back. I'm out. Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Listen, listen, listen, okay? It's not that easy, all right? You got until 12:00 midnight Christmas Eve. And you got to prove to Santa that you've changed, that you've learned your lesson, that you got your Christmas spirit back.

Yeah, that's me and Mom in front of her three precious Christmas trees. She was always more proud of them than she was of me. Yeah. Okay. Are you ready to tell me about Ginger? Okay. Ginger and I were best friends. We were inseparable, honestly. And when I started getting a little chubby, I also got really insecure because kids are assholes. And Ginger always had my back, you know, until the Christmas she decided to make my body a thing. I hate her already. Continue. So we were rehearsing for the Christmas talent show for weeks, and we were just about to go on stage, and... Hey, Ginger! Are you ready? I'm pretty nervous. So they don't think you should perform with us. What? But why? Isn't it obvious, Gummy Tummy? Rude. I hate Christmas. Then she just dropped me. And you really never danced again? No, not at school, or really anywhere else. Yeah, when your best friend dumps you real publicly like that, you sort of learn that life is a little better out of the limelight. Man, that makes me mad. I just want to punch Dasher right in his face. And I like Dasher. He's my guy. Thank you so much for your emotional outburst. Also, you know, I uh... Even though I still don't know how to get out of this mess, I actually do feel a lot better unloading all of that. So thank you. Look at you being surprisingly helpful. Hey, I'm pretty wise.

No, it used to be a bush. Ginger, I'm reporting for work or whatever. Ugh, a note. Okay. Hey, bitch! Sorry, had to close today. Sexmergency. Blame your spicy little friend and his spicy cologne. Oh, girl, I'm pretty sure elves are asexual. I'm not with your friend, B-T-dubs. Not yet. - Gross, come on, girl. Anyways, uh, take the day off. It's Xmas Eve Eve. See you at darts tonight, bitch. Christmas Eve Eve already? God! "I wanna roast your chestnuts this Christmas." I hate that that's so funny, but it is. Ooh. Hey, handsome. Talk about a showstopper. ♪ And no guy in the world like mine ♪ ♪ No way, I miss the nights by the fire ♪ Hi. Just gonna... Aw. ♪ And the city keep on moving ♪ ♪ Last minute lovers like the movie ♪ ♪ Gonna feel like Christmas, baby ♪ He's got the mouth. You playing rummy tonight too? No problem. Oh, I have plenty that I can do. Listen, I'll just see you tomorrow at the party, okay? Okay. Oh! I can't stand her. - Hey, Mom. - Oh, Emily. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I want you to help me apply that gold leaf to the nutcracker dolls. Yeah, I got you. But actually, I wanted to show you something. So I went down to the shop, and I got you a bunch of, you know, really cute but traditional ornaments. But I think we both know that what you really need is a showstopper. Mmhmm. So I found something that your girl Platinum over here would really appreciate. And I want to warn you, it can be seen as a little edgy, but edgy is in right now. Trust me, so... Bam! Isn't he cute? He's a little merman! Yeah. I was thinking that he would go great right in that middle space, right in the center of the tree. Why don't you put all of these on the tree in your daddy's office? Right, of course, the tree no one's gonna see. Mom, do you think maybe you want to try the ornament? It's really, really important. Baby, it's a bit edgy for the judges. Okay, but I'm asking you to try. I'm trying. I'm try... Santa! If your magical ears can hear me, it's not working, so now what? What? What about Santa? Nothing! Did you ask that nice dentist to the party? Mom, I told you I don't want to go with him. He sent me a lock of his hair. It's gross. - Romantic. - Seriously? Baby, he's handsome. He likes you. He's successful. You really don't care what I want, do you? I don't want to see you to end up alone. Now, why would I end up alone? Because I'm not perfect? Because I'm not you? Is it how I act or how I look? No, I don't know. Oh, you don't want to talk about it, but I'm just supposed to settle for someone I don't like because girls that act like me and look like me are supposed to settle? No, not necessarily. Jesus, Mom, you... Baby, I love you. I love you. Just, the world is... Mom, I know how the world is, but you could be on my side. I am on your side! You think you're on my side when you won't even hang up an ornament? This is exactly why I don't talk to you. It is... there's no point. By the way, you probably wouldn't be alone all the time if you didn't expect everybody and everything around you to be perfect all the time! Whatever it is that you think is perfect.

Will anyone be joining you? Nope! Just a little me time. You know, I don't get a lot of me time. So this is extremely exciting. Oh, very good. Yeah. You been working here long? - Two years. - Two years! Oh, very nice. So... I'll bring you that Sancerre. But... oh, okay. - Sancerre. - Yes. - It's my favorite. - Good taste. You too. It might sound crazy, but be my guest. You know what? I was hoping that you would say something like that. - Oh! - Yeah. - Oh. - Yeah. Yeah! Entertaining nonetheless. Oh, my God, that is disgusting.

Yeah, and I need to be a better listener, and I need to be more supportive of my daughter. You got a daughter? No, that one was for you. - Oh. - See what I'm saying? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. I see you. Did you get what I was saying, though? You understood? I'm... my daughter... Whew! She's just like her father. - Okay. - You know what I'm saying? Right. That's all I got to say about it. And I was... I need to be more supportive and listen. Mm-hmm. - I can do that. - You can do that? - Mm-hmm. - Okay! All right. Yes, I can. Cool! You enjoying that Sancerre? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. It's good, ain't it? It's that bubbly. It is good! Do you remember when we were... We had to do the Christmas show? Mm-hmm. And you, like, dumped me as a friend, and then you started saying really mean things about me to like, the whole school. Do you remember that? I didn't... no, no! I don't remember... but wait. Yo, where are those shots? No, yeah, why would you... okay. So I do remember, though. Yeah. And it was like a nightmare for me, honestly. And it just was really weird for me, because you went from, like, being my best friend in the whole world to, like, then being my bully. And it really... it, like, messed me up, honestly, then, and I kind of feel like it still messes me up now. Yeah, dude, but what are you talking about? We were kids. It's like a bajillion years ago.

Well, KLDA Nation, I choked again. I have no idea what I'm writing to Santa tomorrow, and I'm gonna be stuck here in a world made entirely of fruitcake. "I think this one looks nice here after all." Aw, Mom. That's so nice. Good morning. Is it? But I am glad you're up. Thank you. I was really glad to get your note last night. That ornament is super cute. You know, I have been thinking about that. It should go in the back because it does not fit my vision. Okay. Well, it's no use. How can I be helpful? Well, I have to spray paint the banister gold, then I have to go and set up a meeting with that incompetent bartender about what our signature cocktail... Oh, I'll settle that. Is going to be, and... Emily? Way to grab the reindeer by the antlers. I might have a shot at this. Six hours to midnight? Okay, people. The judges will be here at 7:00 sharp, and I want everyone to be whistling Christmas out of their buttholes when they get here. Excuse my French. Uh, who is this woman? That's the competition. You can let her in the house, you can serve her cocktails and canapés, but do not let her touch my trees. If she comes within a 3-foot radius of my trees... Then you have my permission to use force. - Yeah. - That's crazy. Uh, look. You need to talk to your mama. You are running out of time. Does she look like someone who's capable of being talked to? She's not gonna change, okay? She's who she is. I have a few questions about Wyatt, though. Uh, look. She might be more ready to change than you think. Mm, absolutely not. Impossible. Here's my question, though. Okay. Like, let's say I do write this letter to Santa tomorrow, right? Okay, so like, then what happens back in the real world? Like, does my mom become normal? Do I stand up to Ginger? Does, like... Will I be able to find Wyatt? Like, what exactly is the black magic we're working with here? Okay, okay, look, look. You found him before, you can find him again. And Ginger might surprise you. And your mom, for that matter. All right, you're just saying that to save your own ass. No, no, no. I'm saying it because I care about you, all right? And I'm pretty sure that lady's hair was not made out of fruitcake. - Oh, damn, it's spreading. - Yeah. Look, I got to go finish getting ready. Lorraine is gonna blow a gasket if I'm not "picture-perfect by the time the judges get here." I just don't think any of this makes any sense to do. It's not worth it. Damn it!

Unfortunately, my daughter couldn't make it. She's on duty again in the Congo. Doctors Without Borders. Such noble work. Yes, she's a doctor. Thank the Lord. My daughter is dating a dentist. Wow. Mom, I'm actually not gonna do this with you tonight. Linda, good luck tonight. My baby has jokes. Oh, oh! Oh, you must be so proud of your mom. What a perfect family.

Yeah. Something is not right. It's the dress isn't it? Baby, why don't you just go up and change? Do I just disgust you, or is there anything you actually like about me? No, no nogtinis! Lower your voice. Everyone's watching. No, Lorraine! You need to answer me. You're my daughter. I love you. But do you like me? My dress is too tight. I make too many jokes. I eat too many canapés. What do you actually like about me? Now is not the time or the place, young lady. I have actually just wasted so much time letting everyone walk all over me. My friends, my mom, the radio station. But enough! Have you ever once thought about what it was like for me to be your daughter, Mrs. Perfect? What it's like for me to exist while everyone around me makes me feel like I don't even deserve to love myself because of the ass-backwards way that this world judges women? And every comment you make just brings me right back to being that shy and insecure little girl from freshman year. She's always with me, always telling me to be small and quiet, and telling me not to be honest about how I'm feeling. And I am exhausted! That's why I don't come back here! I have only been making suggestions. Baby, it's time to listen. Mom, you have spent a lifetime suggesting everything that was wrong with me, validating every single bully I have ever had, and all I wanted you to do was just look at me one time and suggest what was right about me! Why didn't you say anything? Because as much as I want to be close to you and tell you all of this stuff, you are not the easiest person to talk to. Oh, well, I wouldn't say that. Look, I learned this week that talking about your feelings is actually really, really important, and so is standing up for yourself and asking for what you want. That's my girl. So there will be no more of me doubting myself and no more of me not asking for what I want. That is not who I am anymore. Yes, partner! Preach! Oh, bitch, I know you not talking. Ginger, you were my bully. Do you get that? And no, we are not over it. I'm not over anything. And the messed up part is I actually like you, and we're friends now, but being friends means being honest. And you honestly need to acknowledge what you did to me. And you need to apologize. Maybe then we can be good. No, no. Let me tell you something. We are not in love. Go on somewhere and find your happiness outside of me! And you! Wyatt! How dare you! Why would you show up in this insane Santa reality? Huh? And the thing is, I like you. So do me a favor, okay? This isn't gonna make any sense, but in a few days when a really cute, a little bit plump with a booty, self-assured girl comes up to you and shoots her shot, just say yes. Huh? Just say yes. Because I can flip my tongue over, and only one in 10,000 people can do that. You're gonna miss out on that. And I know that I sound angry, but I am not mad at you! And this tree! Move! How dare you! You stole my mom! Okay, get it out. Get it out. Yeah. No, not my tree! Not Goldy! Not Goldy! No, no, no! Oh, that's not right. Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it! Ahh! No. ♪ Oh, I'm so happy ♪ Feel good, feel good? Peace out, kings and queens! ♪ It's a celebration ♪ Oh, yeah, they definitely win for Best Entertainment. Oh! - Oh, don't you say it. - Say what?

Let me see what you got. Hey, hey! Oh, my God. KLDA listeners, it's me, Emily, and I'm finally a boss-ass bitch. I've said everything I needed to say. You're right. And I'm so glad that you had a chance to say everything you needed to say because I have a few things to say too if that's okay with you. Go ahead. You were right. I tried to control everything, to make everything perfect, and that makes me a terrible listener, a terrible mother. But let me say this, you have to know that I like you. You're funny. You're smart. Oh, you're so funny sometimes, the jokes you make I don't even understand. But that's not your fault. That's my fault. Because I'm not funny. You know, I thought that if I could just make everything perfect, make myself perfect, just push harder, you guys would be proud of me. Because I could take care of you. But you're already perfect because you're you. And I should have been telling you that all the time. I just wonder now, is it too late? No. Of course it's not too late. It's Christmas, for Christ's sakes. It's never too late. Okay, okay. Geez. Right, that's a tough act to follow. But you're right, Em. You're... you are so totally beyond right. I know I bullied you. God, I was so mean. It's really hard for me to think about sometimes, but I've been talking about it in therapy, so... I was an insecure piece of crap, and I took it out on you, and you didn't deserve that. You're so beautiful. I'm so sorry if I ever made you doubt that. You're my best bitch, bitch! Oh, my God, come here. Get it, girl. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Enjoying the party? Oh, yeah, I'm having a good time. Someone assaulted a tree. I know. I saw that. She's crazy. Yeah. She's unhinged. I wouldn't let that person go to a forest because then that... you're in the tree's territory, so... - She gon' get jumped. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I just... I just want to say I loved how you stood up to everyone in there, and I... I think you're incredible. And I'm not really sure what you meant when you asked about this mystery person who might ask me a question, but I will definitely say yes. And if I'm being honest, it kind of sounds like an invitation to an orgy, which I've never done. Not to say I'm not, you know, I can't be a freak. I'm a freak. I get freaky. Not like freaky, ugh. Like freaky, hmm. But rated on a scale? A moderate six. You know. I could work with that. Yeah, yeah. Well, good, because whenever you meet an Emily, you know, you kind of want to hang on to them. So you know, I might push it to a seven. We'll get you to eight. Ooh! Oh. Emily, you want to go back into the party and have a good time? Yes. Um, yeah. Yep. But I'm gonna be in in a little bit. I have to go... I actually have to go do something. - I got a job to do. - Yeah, totally, totally. I'll meet you in there, though. - All right. - We'll get you at a nine. Okay. It really is a lovely tree. You okay? I think I will be. You know, we've had an opening at the rummy table if that doesn't sound too awful. Oh, I'd love that! Oh, if you don't mind messy pajamas and too many Sancerres. Oh, I love Sancerres, and the messier the better. I am just exhausted with all this perfection stuff. Could you help me with this? Sure, hold these. Okay, I got it. There you go. Oh, I think it's right. It's perfect. What, what, what, what, what. Oh. You ready to do this? Yes, did you leave the rest of B2K at the party?

So let's start it off right with our first caller. Hi, you're on the air with Emily. What's your name, and what's your problem? Linda, and I have a game night emergency. But also, I'm so proud of you, honey. Hi, Mom. What's your question?
