I was so excited. I just got my degree. I needed something to keep me on my feet. The shifts were so long and... they just got longer. So, I started taking my patient's leftovers. I never thought I'd be the kind of person who'd do that, never. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] The thing that I was the proudest. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [music continues] [sighing] [coins clinking] Well, looks like we both made a whopping $3.45 in tips tonight. You can have it. What's wrong? Nothing.

My envelope, like, must be in the mail. I'll got get it right now. Oh, my gosh! The next year's gonna be amazing, together... It's-it's gonna be so fun. I-I also got into another school, so... You applied somewhere else? What? Like a, like a safety school? Yeah. I mean... I didn't think I'd get in, but... Yeah, I know we talked about going to-- Talked? No. You promised. [Ethan] I know. I just... got into a better school and... -Better? Wh-where? -[Ethan] No, sorry, not better. Brown. [Ashley] Brown? Wh-where's that? Rhode Island. They offered me a full scholarship and... So now you're going there? Well, I-I mean... I don't know yet, I... So you lied to me? After two years of being together? We should probably, um... Oh, my... You're telling me this here because you knew that I'd be upset and you didn't want me making a scene? You are such a little boy! You know what? Good luck finding anyone at Brown who's gonna put up with all of your baggage. Baggage-- So you wanna break up with me now? Wait. I... No, no, no, I-- If you wanna break up with me, then-then you know what? You chew way too loudly, all right? And-and you never respond to texts. You never listen to me or ask me questions about my day. You-your breath reeks of tobacco and plus... plus, I give you blowjobs and you can barely stand to even finger me. All right? You're selfish and sexist! All right? So, wake the fuck up! You're gonna have to because your dick is shit! [men giggling] [horn honking] [mellow music] Hey, Alex. No, ma. It's Ethan. Dad's long gone. [Michelle] You Alex? It's Derek, ma. [Derek] What about the, uh, the-the Whitney song from the Costner movie? -Do you remember that one? -Technically, it's a Dolly song. [Derek] It's actually a Whitney song. Do you remember it? Can you sing it, please? -Hey, she's passing out. -[Derek] Oh, shit! -Ma? Hey! -Hey? Ma? -Ma, look at me. -[Ethan] Ma? -Wake up! Eye contact, please! -[Ethan] Hey! Ma! Hey! [tires screeching] -[machine beeping] -[exhales] [indistinct chatter] -Where are my boys? -You're not supposed to be up. Ring your bell and someone will come... [woman 2] Was the weather any factor? [Derek] No, the weather was fine. The roads were fine. I think I was just, uh, more exhausted than I realized. [Michelle] Have you seen my boys? [sighing] Are you okay? Is Derek in there? We could have died last night. Do you understand? We could have died last night. We're done. We're not searching for you anymore. If you wanna kill yourself, go ahead. Honey, I'm really sorry. I-- I don't care if you're sorry. You're always sorry. -Go back to rehab. -I've tried. [Ethan] Then commit yourself to a psych facility. I'm not crazy. Derek's in there taking the blame for what happened. You almost cost him his life, and all he can worry about is the cops dragging you into this. You're gonna kill him. And the most fucked up part is, he'd let you. Stay out here. You'll just mess things up. [door closes] [somber music] [sniffles] [sighing] Psst. [whispers] Derek. [clanks] Hey. Hey. -You okay? -Yeah. [Derek groans] Um... I just found out I got into Tech. -What? -Yeah. [chuckling] Dude! That's amazing! Get over here! -Oh. Thank you. -Congratulations, man! -I'm so happy for you. -Thank you. Um, I actually got into two schools. [chuckles] That's... twice as amazing. Congrats. Thanks. Um... Yeah. The other one's Brown, which is kinda far away, but... Brownsville's only, like, an hour outside of here. [chuckles] No. Uh, Brown's not in Brownsville. It's in Providence, Rhode Island. I mean, it's an Ivy League school. So, they, ah... And they... I mean, they offered me full scholarship. Which is kind of unheard of, I guess. I'm really proud of you, man. Thanks. And you're leaning towards Brown? I think so. [Ethan sighs] Listen... she's not gonna get any better if we just keep picking up the pieces-- Come on. Do we have to do this right now, when I'm, I'm sitting in a hospital bed? We agreed, though. You know? You go pursue acting when I head to college, right? -[Derek] Yeah. -[scoffs] -She needs to try rehab again. -With what money? Look at what just happened to you. This is my fault. I was the one who was driving. Don't. [sighs] We need to figure something out. Like, I haven't been trying for years. Then let me try. If we don't figure this out, we're gonna be stuck here. [sighs] [instrumental music on radio] Hello. Are you Dirk? Derek. Yeah. [instrumental music] [Michelle] Can't believe it. My boy... the first in our family to go to college! This is... I'm just so proud of you. Thanks. Do you know what you wanna study? -Gonna be a lawyer, a doctor-- -[Ethan] Fuck doctors. He wants to be an English major, ma. Because the world needs more unemployed writers. Not all English majors end up broke. I'll be fine. And, honey, you should just do what you wanna do. [Derek] So, uh, what did Vicki say about this place again? Uh, she said that it's nice, and it's close. It costs an arm and a leg, and that it's probably a scam? Not all of them are like that, but... [Derek] I feel like the people are always so creepy too. [Ethan] We're not going to a psych facility. We're going to a rehab resort. All right? Vicki said they have kayaking and Bingo, so just... try to keep an open mind. Well, consider my mind open. And thank you so much for finding it. [Derek] You see that guy? English major. We can accommodate both vegetarian and vegan meals. Uh, our menu changes daily. Now, right down there is, uh, the non-denominational chapel right next to the yoga room. Well... what do you think? -It's really nice. -How much is it? Oh, the-the prices are listed here. I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. [Ethan chuckles] -Are you fucking kidding me? -Hey. Who could possibly afford this? We have been operating at full capacity for nearly eight years now-- Excuse me, Vicki said that you might be able to offer us a discount. We can absolutely take five percent off for those families that require financial aid. -That'd be $800 a day? -Hm. Told you it was a racket. Winding Brook's free. [chuckles] If you can convince her to go to a psych ward, then be my guest. Well, we can have her committed, if we prove she tried to harm herself. You know that's not what she's doing. What? She's not crazy. She doesn't... eat people or throw her own feces. Rehab's the right move if she has to go anywhere at all. [Ethan] She does. She has to go somewhere. [indistinct chatter] [water running] [vehicle beeping] [Michelle] Hey, boys! Dinner's on me. [sighs] [instrumental music on speakers] [Michelle] Food's good, huh? What do you boys think? [Derek] Yeah. It's great, ma. Thank you. Yeah. So, my boy's going to college on a scholarship this fall. -Mmm. -First in our family. -Thank you. It's exciting. -How about that? [laughs] Thank you. Thank you. So, I think I found a new treatment place for us to check out. -Oh, yeah? -[Ethan] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's called Serenity Springs. -How'd you hear about it? -[Ethan] Uh, Vicki. She said it's not as luxurious as Rosewood was, but, uh, they got lot to offer, so... Okay. So what? It's like a coach instead of first class? Yeah, right, no, um... You know, you may not get a filet mignon on the flight, but everyone gets to the same destination. -Hm. Right. -Okay. What do you think? It's also a state facility. So, insurance picks most of it. And then we can cover the co-pays with the money we got from the car insurance. But we do need the car insurance money to pay for another car. Uh, yeah, I mean... But we can wait a little bit. Uh, says the person leaving town. Uh, you're leaving town, too though. We'll see. But we do need the money for another car. Okay, so if you come back healthy, it's money well spent. I thought that's-that's what we wanted? I do, but, um, you know, I also need to drive places sometimes, and it's kinda hard to do without a car. You know what? If we can figure the money out, I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay. Well, in that case, I will pick up some extra shifts at the alley. And maybe I can start going out for more commercial work. I think that's a great idea. [claps] Awesome! [car door shuts] [sighs] You again. [instrumental music] What do you think? So I saw that you have a yoga studio. Uh, in theory. We had to put the instructor's salary toward a new water heater. It's more of a janitorial closet now. But maybe the mops are doing downward dog in there or something. [chuckles] Nothing surprises me anymore. Here we go. So, uh, you gonna be okay in here? Yeah, of course. Listen, you say, "Go," and we'll come and bust you out. -Okay? -Okay. [both chuckle] [Dennis] There's one visitation day two Saturdays from now. But in the meantime, just try to give her some space. Yeah. I'm just glad she's here. Good. It's important you keep your expectations in check. We tell all our families this, within the first year, patient's relapse... -About 50% of the time. -Yeah. Yeah, we know. -Not your mom's first rodeo? -Mm-mm. Not by a long shot. It's been a while since the last time she tried though. So... Well, at-at the very least, it's a major step in the right direction. Yup. -Excuse me. -[Dennis] Mm-mm. [Derek] You good? [Michelle chuckles] Thanks. [Derek] You got everything, right? Yeah. I'm just gonna get my clothes. [bell ringing] Skipping class? [chuckles] I wish. I didn't see you in English earlier. Yeah, just, uh... Just runnin' a little late. Mm. Story of my life. [both chuckle] Catch you at lunch? -Yeah, absolutely. -Cool. [instrumental music] [vacuum whirring] [instrumental music on speakers] [pins clanking] Hello. -Hi, Derek. -[Derek] Ladies. Skippin' school? See you got some, uh, time to spare. -It's a bowling joke. -[woman 3] No, we get it. It's our free period. We're both size seven, by the way. [Derek] Got it. There you are. And it is $10.49. But I can take off ten cents if you say "hi" to Melanie for me. [woman 3] You're still together? Yeah. [woman 4] I saw you in that mattress commercial the other day. -You're in commercials? -Yeah. I thought that was supposed to be good money. Why are you still working here? Hmm, it was a long time ago. [Derek] "Love's in the air." "Love's on our mind." "Always has been. Always will be." -Sounds too cheesy. -"Love's in the air." "Love's on our mind. Always has been. Always will be." That's better. You know, I think I'm just gonna wait for another one, honestly. Listen, you are one of the most prolific regional TV commercial actors in state history. All right? It's time for you to get back on your horse and reclaim that throne. Come on, man. There's absolutely no reason for you to miss this one. Ma's gone, you're a free man. I mean, this is what you wanna do, right? Yeah. I believe in you. [sighs] I'm... I'm trying to be encouraging. I don't know. I-- -Oh, is that... Oh, okay. -How do I sound? It's... I think I'm still getting used to it. -Yeah, that's fair enough. -Yeah. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Love's in the air. Love's on our mind. Always has been, always will be.

She's great, actually. It's just, um... Going to different colleges, and... And... That's the only reason? For the most part. Well, um... if you've moved on... would you mind if I asked her out? No. Not at all. Thanks. [indistinct TV chatter] [door closes] [Derek] Ooh! You smell like an ashtray. Yeah, I went to the alley. [Derek] Yeah? Look at you, makin' friends. What's gotten into you? [sighs] Well, if you must know. They're looking for a new Virginia Tourism spokesman and, uh, Sue wants to put me up for the state audition. -Wait, for real? -Mm. -You serious? Wait, what? -Uh-huh. [Derek chuckles] Yeah, I can't still believe it. -Wait, so what happens next? -Um... That's the thing, the audition's next week in Richmond. So? So, hotels are $90 a night. At least. So? [chuckles] It's fine. I'm just excited your boy's still got it. Oh, com-- Well, you have to go. No. We seriously can't afford it. [door opens] -Where did you get this? -The stock market. It's my tip money. Take it. [chuckles] No. I... I already told Sue I couldn't go. Lance is going instead. Call her. Change her mind. Yeah, but then I'd be leaving you here alone. And what if something happened with ma? -No. -I'll be fine. The world will still turn if you leave for a few days. [laughing] Just... Let me think about it. Okay? I'm excited for you. Yeah. I am, too, I guess. [both laughing] [instrumental music] [Derek] Be encouraging, okay? Even if she's not doing well. [Ethan] I know. Last time she asked to come home during visitation day, so just be prepared for that, all right? Okay. I just don't want you getting upset if she's not doing-- I get it. All right? My expectations are low, trust me. It's just... -I'm glad she made it this far. -Yeah. [Michelle gasps] I thought I heard your voices. -Hi. -Good to see you. -Oh, it's so good to see you. -Hey. -Hi. -You look great, ma. -Really? Well, thank you. -[Ethan] Yeah. You know, it's what our routines will help you do. Just feel amazing. I just... I'm journalling and exercising and meditating. You meditate? Yeah. Yeah, I do. -Hmm. -Wow. [Michelle] Yeah. [Dennis] In some of the work we've been doing in here, a lot's been coming up for your mom around your father, Alex. It might be good if the family gets a chance to process his leaving all together. Michelle, do you wanna share some of what we've been talking about in here? Alex, who? [chuckles] [Dennis] Well, you can start with what we were talking about yesterday in group. Some of your regrets. [Michelle] Oh, I do regret... letting him paint the house instead of hiring someone. [chuckles] Because it took a year, and then, the shutters were still stuck to the wall. So... Oh, and I also regret letting him make breakfast. When he actually would make breakfast, but then he would forget that I was allergic to eggs. So, that is never fun-- Michelle. Quit messing around. Come on. Okay. I, um... I do regret being stupid enough to believe that all of his trips to Richmond were for business and not to screw someone named Val. [Dennis] All right, I see. Ethan and Derek, since you're both here, is there anything you wanna say to your mom? Anything you feel might be important for her to hear? [Derek] Well, I just... wanna say that I'm sorry that I was skeptical at first. Um... I'm really glad you're here. And... I hope that you know that... we'll always be here for you, uh, to support you in your recovery. And, um... I guess, I just... I just wonder sometimes if... if you realize, like, what you do, um... sometimes what you do really sucks. And it kinda seems like you don't care. Uh, about, about us. Sorry. I-I want you to be around fo-for a while. And, um... I think about it. I mean, I worry about it, like, if you die, you know, and, um... and, um... I... I guess I... Well, I think about it, like, all the time. Like... every day. You okay? Yeah. It's just kinda weird thinking of what we'd do if she actually got better, you know? Yeah, I mean, maybe move to a town where you can audition for more than just pet store commercials. [chuckles] It's kind of scary to think about. But it's kind of exciting too, right? [Ashley] Have a nice day. She really is mad at you. Yup. Do you ever wonder how people were supposed to have these profound breakthroughs in rooms like... this? I want you to talk to me about what happened when your boys came in. [sighs] They've been through so much. I mean, I don't know, is it that terrible for me to wanna lighten things up every now and again? [Dennis] Yeah, I'm not buying that, Michelle. Why are you afraid to show your boys that you're trying? You could lose them. A few more rounds of this, and you really will. I've seen it over and over again. You'll be that anecdote they apologetically tell on first dates. "Wait, my mom's an addict." Mm-hmm. So, I'm gonna lose them eventually, won't I? If you do your job right, yes, they'll grow up, they'll move out the house-- What's wrong with me wanting to just have it all slowed down? What we're doing in here, if you'll let me, is helping you see what it'd be like if you kept up. Keep up? With what? I mean, I... I've-I've blown it, haven't I? I mean, I'm an awful... mother. I wanted to be a good mom... that goes to PTA meetings and makes good meals, and gives great relationship advice. But every single time... that I see them, I'm just reminded that I have failed. I was watching this Dr. Phil, or something and there was a girl who had this maladapti... mala... Maladaptive daydreaming disorder. Yeah. I don't know why they call it a disorder. Anyway, she was 19, just like me when she had her first... her first kid and her husband left her... uh, with no money to her name. And her children hated her. And so, she would just... create these fantasies where, um... she would just imagine sons that loved her. [Dennis] That's delusional behavior. Well, I feel for those people. I mean, in this world... Come on, with these walls and these stupid stuffed animals. I mean, this is as two feet in as I can be. So... Listen, there are... There are a lot of really good people in the world who really tried their best, but it's not good enough. How's the bowling industry? It's pretty good. Lester thinks I might be management material. I think he found my calling. I also got a new audition. That's cool. You okay? [Melanie sighs] I just hate my job. I have to work on Friday, which means I can't go to Jessica's birthday party. I didn't even tell you about that because I knew you wouldn't be able to go anyway, 'cause you're always working. I mean, nobody buys clothes in person anymore. It's pointless. Retail's dead. [Derek] Then why don't you just quit? I mean, it's not like you need the money really, your parents-- [Melanie] It's not about the money. My mom says I need to learn the value of real work. Plus, they said they'd get me a new car for graduation if I can keep the job through May. So... Cool. I mean, there must be at least one positive to your job though-- Can I just be allowed to complain? Why do you always have to put a bow on everything? [chuckles] I don't know. I mean, w-w-what is the positive to this job? Um... I don't know, some nights, I, uh... I make puppets out of the coffee cups... then I put on little plays about things that are stressing me out. I've found it to be cathartic. [chuckles] Well, that's... really something. [Derek] Everyone's leaving for college. And I feel like college is angry at me for not going, so he's taking everyone away as revenge. [Melanie] That's the script to your play? [Derek] It's improv. [Melanie] You know, you could leave, too. [Derek sighs] Right. But it's complicated though-- [Melanie] It doesn't have to be. You pick a day... and then you go. [Derek] All I know is I wish you weren't leaving. [Melanie] I'll only be two hours away. [Derek] Yay! At least we'll have weekends. Right? [Melanie] I don't know. I mean, I'd, I'd like to. I've... I've just never been to college. Heard it gets busy. [Derek] We'll make it work.

Look, if you're really so sorry, then why don't you just fix it? [scoffs] Do you know that I'd give anything for that? -Then why don't you? -[Michelle] I don't know. I mean, it's just not that easy. Right? Like... I'm sick. And I don't really know what else to say about it bec... [sighs] Sorry. [Michelle] No, it's okay. It's honestly... I mean, you need to... You need to say things like that. But you're, um, you're feeling better? [Michelle] Yeah, I am. I'm really, um, really, I'm trying the best I can. [Ethan] I know. Thank you for the advice with Ashley. Yeah, of course. [sniffles] Listen, that's a tough situation. [chuckles] But I also know how sensitive you are because I've changed your diapers. [laughs] Remember... when I used to take you boys to the dock, and, oh, my goodness, as soon as you would catch a fish... [laughs] You would start crying because you thought you were gonna hurt them it was, aww. [Ethan] I know. You've told me that story a thousand times, ma. [chuckles] You're just so... [exhales deeply] God. I'm really proud of you boys. Really. I do not know what I did to deserve to be your mother. [chuckling] [instrumental music] [door opens] [door shuts] I just, I just wanna say I'm sor... I just wanna say I'm sorry. You're not sorry. Okay? You just feel guilty, so you're coming here to see if you can make me happy enough, so you can stop thinking about it and move on once you get to Rhode Island. Wait, what? My mom said that you're a parentified child. Is that a bad thing or? We all have stuff that we're going through. But guess who was never a dick to you during any of your stuff? Me. I know. I just... I mean, I just wanted to see if I could get in. You know? I didn't really think-- [Ashley] But we had a plan! How does someone who says that they love you, your best friend, how does that person make a decision like that, and just not tell you? For months? Well? Hmm. So, you want a cone? I'm throwing out the mint chip soon. -That's my favorite. -I know, you asshole. That's why I mentioned it. [sighs] Look, I guess I was just scared to tell you. I mean, like, I-I didn't... I mean, I-I guess I was just... I just feel really bad for hurting you, you know... [Ashley] I had sex with Mark Gillespie. Come again? I slept with Mark Gillespie. I just... I had to make sure that there was nothing wrong with me. [instrumental music] [Derek] So, it's, uh, down between me and two other guys now. [Ethan laughs] What?! [Derek] Yeah. And the callbacks supposed to be the next... It's actually the morning after ma arrives. [Ethan] That's amazing! [Derek] Yeah, I know. I'm so excited. [Ethan] Wait, so how was Richmond? [Derek] It was a lot of fun. Mike has an apartment there with a bunch his other actor friends. We stayed up till, like, 3:00 a.m. last night and then, uh, went to VCU's Art Museum the day after. It was much better than Langford's. [Ethan] Langford doesn't have a museum. [Derek] I know. It was a joke. [Ethan] Oh. [Michelle] I wanna see my boys become adults. You know? At dinner, we'll... discuss the great American novel that Ethan is writing. And... how Derek has passed on another action movie because he wants to do one of those BBC period things because he knows that I love them. And, uh, when they need breaks, of course... I'll get to baby-sit my grand-babies, and then I'll spoil them rotten. And they'll call me really fun grandma names, you know, like... Mimi or Mee-maw or... I don't know. Something like that. [Dennis] And sounds like a good plan. But managing the disease is a 24/7 job. You can do this. Just remember, one day at a time. We will call you a cab. Go grab your things and head out front. -Okay. Thank you. -All right. [Dennis] Hey. Ready to get started? [door closes] [instrumental music] [woman 5] See you later. Do you have any balloons that just say, like, "Welcome home, mom." No, actually, we're all sold out. Ned Marshall's uncle just got outta Wallen's. -Did ten for manslaughter. -Cool. How about, like, unmarked balloons? Nope. Got a bunch of "Happy Birthdays." We could cross out the "Birthday" with a sharpie. And just have "Happy" balloons? ♪ It's not just sweet ♪ ♪ Way you talk ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ It's not the cute cute way you walk ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ It's not the way ♪ [Derek giggling] ♪ They can say... ♪ -Looking good in here. -Thank you.

Yeah. I'm just doing some homework. [sighs] Hey. I'm... I'm sorry if... if you got your hopes up. [chuckles] Someone's gotta keep rooting for her, right? I don't... I don't feel good about this. You're going to this audition. You're going to Richmond. Come on, let's just run it from the top. "Wow, Pete, these caverns are amazing." Pete, that's your line. Yeah, no. I don't know, I-I.., It doesn't feel right. With her roaming around, I-I don't... I don't think I should go. Hey. Look, if you go... I'll search until I find her. Deal? Come on. You can't miss this audition. Let's go. Bus leaves in 20. All right, let's run it from the top. Yeah, okay. [mellow music] [engine whirring] [music continues] [engine revving] Sorry. You don't have to apologize to me. It's your future. [instrumental music] Could you head towards the luncheonette out on Water Street, please? [Ethan] We already looked there. It's always the last damn ride of the night. Look, I can't keep driving around like this. -I like you guys, but... -Yeah. I gotta pick up my kids, and my ex always gives me shit when I'm late. -You can just take us home. -Yeah, no, wait. Do you even know where the hell we're goin'? -Thank you, yeah. -[Lambert] Bye. [phone beeps] Can you drop us off at Fair Oaks, please? That was Sheriff Lambert. She wants us to head to the hospital. They found an unresponsive woman and she matches ma's description. [door closes] [indistinct chatter] [machine whirring] Okay, so the unresponsive woman died, and they just, um, they want us to see if it's... Just go upstairs, you look like you're about to faint. I'm fine. I got this. [somber music] [door thuds] [rattling] [zipper whirrs] No. It's not her. [mechanical whirring] [door clanking] [whimpering] [bell rings] [whimpering] [sobbing] [sniffles] [sobbing] [sniffles] [somber music] We need to find a car. Come on. We need to find a car. [crickets chirping] Where are you going? To sleep... at home. Can you please stop being dramatic? -I'm being dramatic? -[Derek] Yeah. -Let's keep going. Come on. -[Ethan] Wait. Why do you wanna keep running around town? I don't want to do any of this. [scoffs] You're fucking insane. Right. Oh, I'm insane for trying to keep ma alive? The second I graduate, I'm getting out of here. -You should, too. -[chuckles] Okay, cool. I'll consider the suggestion, but, can we please keep on going looking-- No! I hate her, and you should too. Look, I know you think I'm pathetic for staying-- [Ethan] You're right. It is pathetic. She throws all of the help that we give her right back at our faces, and you want us to keep standing there and taking it. I mean, come on. Wake the fuck up. She's not getting any better. You're not a loser. But if you stay here and you keep dating high schoolers, and using mom as an excuse to not have any money... you're gonna become one. It's gonna happen way sooner than you think. And I'd hate that. [knocking on door] [knocking on door] I-I can't leave. Are you nuts? It's like 3 o'clock in the fucking morning. Can I just talk to your mom? Like... -She likes me-- -Are you serious? She does not like you. I'd have to wake her up. Oh, my God, fine, but I know what she's gonna say. [key jingling] She said no, and that she hates that I'm dating someone without a curfew. Okay. Thanks for asking. She also said that you shouldn't be out here looking for her in the middle-- Yeah, I know. Seriously, thank you. Just... go home. Get some rest. I'll look with you in the morning. -Okay. -Okay? -Yeah. I'll see you. -All right? [rattling] [car door opens] [engine starts] [water lapping] [Derek] I thought you were going home. [Ethan] You know the story that ma always tells about taking us fishing? You mean, the one where you cried like a baby every time you caught a fish? That was at Greenbriar Park, right? [Derek] Greenbriar? No, why? Well, was, was there another dock, or... [Derek] Uh, yeah. The one by the lighthouse. But the town closed it down like a decade ago. [pensive music] [thunder rumbling] [crickets chirping] [tires screeching] [leaves rustling] [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [music continues] Is she okay? Hey. We need to get her to a hospital. I just don't know what the point is anymore. [machine beeping] [Derek] We can't put her back in rehab. [machine beeps] Not with the results we're getting. It's just throwing money away. What about Winding Brook? We can't force her into a psych ward unless she hurt herself on purpose. This doesn't count? Don't worry. I'll figure something out. I just had a moment back there. Sorry. Everything's gonna be okay. [knocking on door] Yeah. [indistinct chatter] [woman 6] I really think that she can be better. [indistinct chatter] [Derek] Do you have any groups here? [woman 6] Well, there are some group options. [machine beeping] [distant rattling] [machine beeping] [indistinct chatter] [machine beeps] [paper rustling] [keys clacking] [machine beeping rapidly] [door opens] [Ethan] She cut herself! Please, please... She cut herself. She's just... She is hurting herself. -I-I don't know... -Ethan! Ethan, baby! Look at me. Calm down. [Ethan] I don't-I don't know what to do. I.. [Vicki] Just... All right, just calm down. Just calm down. I'm gonna check out what's going on. [machine beeping rapidly] [indistinct chatter] [somber music] [crying] [sniffles] [music continues] [clock ticking] [horn honking] [door closes] [Derek sighs] So, how'd you get the minivan? You don't like Charlemagne? -I nicknamed the car. -Yeah, yeah, I get it. [Ethan chuckles] [buzzer buzzing] [screeching] -Hi, sweetheart! -Hi!
