You sing loud and I'll sing louder, tonight we're settin' the woods on fire. You're my gal and I'm your fella, dressed up in your frock of yeller. I look swell, but you look sweller setting the woods on fire. We'll take in all the honky tonks, tonight we're having fun. We'll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done. I don't care who thinks we're silly. You be daffy. I'll be dilly. We'll order up two bowls of chili, setting the woods on fire. I'll gas up my hot rod stoker. We'll get hotter than a poker. You'll be broke, but I'll be broker. Tonight we're setting the woods on fire. We'll sit close to one another, up one street and down the other. Will we have a time, oh brother, setting the woods on fire. We'll put aside a little time to fix a flat or two. My trey and tube are doing fine but the air is showing through. I used to get a real kick out of hearing my own songs on the radio. God, I'm feeling foolish. I just can't stand to be cooped up like this. DJ [ON RADIO]: Yes, sir, folks. That was Hank Williams, the king of country music with another number one hit. King of country music. Wish I didn't have to play in a big arena in Ohio tomorrow night. Tonight's the night I should be up on some stage somwheres. Yeah, some nice little place like one of them bars we're driving right on past. Lately, I've been going up on them stages and pretending. But tonight, you know, I could say it right. The boys can be there and somebody'd have a fiddle. A good old Saturday night band. We could have the best damn New Year's Eve party anybody ever saw, yeah. [chatter] [music playing] Well, thank you very much. [chatter] So I turned to him and I said, well, Jackson, if'n that's the way you feel about it, you can just have your ring back. And I tell you, he sure was shocked. [laughter] [chatter] [applause] Right along about now, I guess the boys will be warming up the crowd with "Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do?" [SINGING] Well, why don't you love me, like you used to do? Why do you treat me like a worn out shoe? My hair's still curly and my eyee are still blue. So why don't you love me like you used to do? [music playing] Ah, Eric. Happy New Year! Woo! My ma had 13 kids. And only eight of us survived. Hey. [car honks] Hey, he's here. I just saw him-- Hank Williams. I really did. Where? Oh, there he is.

Sorry, right this way, please, Mr. Williams. Thank you, ma'am. It's like a centipede. Thanks for helpin' me. He's a lot taller than I thought he'd be. Why, I've never seen anyone in person before. Looks pretty ordinary to me. Ladies and gentlemen, right now we're proud to introduce you to the finest country gentleman of all time. Star of radio, recordings, and personal appearances, and the writer and singer of such great songs "Your Cheating Heart," "Hey, Good Looking," "So Lonesome I Could Die," and many others. We're joined now by Alabama, ladies and gentlemen. [inaudible] himself! [cheering] Well, this is a mighty fine hall y'all got here. Yes, sir.

We're gonna have ourselves a good time. Happy New Year's, everybody. Happy New Year's. Thank you, Hank. Happy New Year! Well, you only got about an hour left. But you know, I, for one, won't be too sad to see 1952 go on by. I can see a whole lot of changes coming down the road for nineteen hundred and fifty-three. Well, we're going to have a new administration up there in Washington. Inauguration day for old Ike and Richard Nixon coming up any time now, that's right. And maybe this year, our boys are finally going to win that war over in Korea. Be nice to get that mess all cleaned up and have our boys back here with their loved ones. Wouldn't that be nice? Well, maybe this year the Dodgers are finally going to beat them damn New York Yankees in the World Series. [cheering] Of course, looking into New Year's can be scary sometimes, too. I don't know what it is. You know, sometimes you just kind of get a feeling that, well, there's something coming down-- something coming down the road at me or something like that. I just don't know. I don't know what it is. Come on, boy, play us some music. That's what people want to hear. I mean, that's what they paid their money for. MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "HONKY TONKIN'" One, two, three.

MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "LONESOME BLUES" I got a feeling called the blues, oh, Lord, since my baby said goodbye. Lord, I don't know what I'll do, all I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord. That last long day she said goodbye Well Lord I thought I would cry. She'll do me, she'll do you. She's got that kind of loving. Lord I love to hear her when she call me sweet daddy. Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it all over. I've lost my heart it seems. I've grown so used to you somehow, we'll I'm nobody's sugar daddy now and I'm lonesome. I got the lovesick blues. Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal. That's what's the matter with me. Yes, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal but she don't care about me. Lord, I tried and I tried to keep her satisfied but she just wouldn't stay. So now that she is leaving This is all that I can say. I got a feeling called the blues oh Lord since my baby said goodbye. Oh Lord, I don't know what to do, all I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord. Last long day she said goodbye, Lord I thought I would cry. She'll do me. She'll do you. She's got that kind of loving. Lord I love to hear it when she calls me sweet daddy. Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it all over. I've lost my heart it seems. And I've grown so used to you somehow. Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now and I'm lonesome. I got the lovesick blues. [cheering] Thank you so much. You know, some would say that ain't much of a song, but I mean he's done all right by me so far. It's made me $34,000. I remember one time this fella come up to me. You know what he said? Hank, he said, I sure am getting tired of hearing you singing that stupid song. Why don't you learn a new one? Well, buddy, I said, that song's done pretty good by me. You tell me what song's ever made you $34,000. I'll sing that one. [laughter] [cheers and applause] Yeah, I remember the first time I ever played up there at the Grand Ole Opry. Must of been two or three years ago. '49, wasn't it? '49. Yup, '49. Well, sir, I must have gotten half dozen encores, you know. They just wouldn't let me get off that stage. [cheers and applause] I can't rightly seem to get the hang of this here guitar tonight. I don't know what it is. Seems like someone went and switched the strings around on me. Must have been when I was out having me a little glass of milk. Of course, I don't play too good the best of times. I play the way I play is all. I remember the first time I ever heard Teddy here play the guitar. I like the way he played. So I asked him if he wanted to join my band. He said, oh I could never play with you Mr. Williams because the only chords I know was is C, G, and B. I said Teddy that's all there is. [laughter] [cheers and applause] Now, I learned guitar myself. And I was no more than 9 or 10 years old by an old negro street singer named Rufus Payne. Tee Tot everybody called him. A funny name, that. Tee Tot. But that's what they called him. And old Tee Tot, he learned me everything I ever knew about guitar playing. Of course, he's dead now. He left us many years ago. But you can't live in the past all the time. So come on, boys, let's play some more tunes for these folks here. I'm sure they'd enjoy it. Wouldn't you? Huh? MAN: Mind you own business. [cheering] Jambalaya! [crowd gasps] [cheers and applause] I'm so embarrassed. [stammers] Well, honey, you win a Kewpie doll. Now-- now, what song y'all want to hear? "Kaw-Liga." "Kaw-Liga?" You heard the lady. Never turn a lady down. MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "KAW LIGA" Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door. He fell in love with a Indian maiden over in the antique store. Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show. So she could answer yes or no. He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk. The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk. Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign, because his heart was made of knotty pine. Oh poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss. Poor old Kaw-Liga, he didn't know what he missed. Is it any wonder that his face is red? Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head. Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went no where. His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair. Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show, so she could never answer yes or no. And then one day a wealthy customer bought that Indian maid, and took her oh so far away but old Kaw-Liga stayed. Kaw-Liga just stands there lonely as can be and wishes he was still an old pine tree. Oh, poor old Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss. Oh poor old Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed. Is it any wonder that his face is red? Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head. [cheers and applause] MAN: Excuse me. Outta my way. Excuse me. Hey. - Oh, no, thanks. No, I'm all right. Have one on me. Thanks, I never touch the stuff. Oh, come on. Wet your whistle. Well, thank you, buddy. Thank you. Right. It sure does look good, but, you know, lately I've been trying to cut down on my drinking. And you know what? I've been doing real good lately. Good for you, Hank. Yeah. At least, when I've been trying. It's funny what drinking will do to a man. I don't know if any of you out there ever had one too many ever once in a while? Not me! [laughter] Well, I'll tell you, it kind of messes up your sense of time. I remember one time Fred Rose-- you know, that's the fella who publishes my songs up there in Nashville. He called me on the telephone. He said, Hank. He said, we figure it's time for you to cut a new record. I said, Fred, what's wrong with the one I done last week? Well, he kind of hemmed and hawed. And he said, Hank, the last record you made was four months ago. Now, since that time, your version sold half a million. But Tony Bennett's version has sold 2 million. Well, I finally got the time sequence straight my head but there was one little thing I could never figure out. Just who the hell is Tony Bennett? [laughter] Oh, he's just playing with us. [laughs] [applause] You know, times have changed and I'm really trying to cut down on my drinking because, you know, all my buddies up there in Nashville-- my good friends-- they got big plans for me when I went to get off of this road tour. Yes sir, big plans, just so long as I can cut down on the booze. Big plans. Them Opry folks never should have fired me like that. Now, what'd they say that date was again? Well, one of these days when I walk on out that Opry stage, one of these days. Man, it sure is fine. [applause] [VOICEOVER] Howdy, folks, mighty glad to be back here at the Opry. Thanks be to God and, of course, radio station WSM and The National Life and Accident Insurance Company. Well, sir, I see the Opry ain't changed a whole lot since I've been away. I look over here and a ways there and there's Earnest Tubb waiting come on out. Well, and there's Roy Acuff, and Hank Snow, and Cousin Minnie Pearl. MINNIE PEARL [VOICEOVER]: Howdy, Hank. Howdy, Minnie. Sure is fine to be back up here. Now, if you ways to ask me why I'd been away so long, this is what I'd tell you. [MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "TOO MANY PARTIES AND TOO MANY PALS"] Too many parties and too many pals will break your heart some day. Too many evenings spent out on the town will drive good fortune away. Gentlemen of the jury, the judge's speech began. The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge was a stern old man. Now, this prisoner here before you. Why he's a social enemy, an outcast and a drunkard. And you know the penalty. His face reflects the nightlife. His eyes are sunk with pain, but you know your brother, gentlemen, is a very respected man. Now, in someways he's not like him, and yet he might have been. If it hadn't a been for his drinking buddies, fast women, and gin. See, we took the nightlife off the streets, brought it into our own dens with the smiles of faceless women and the men who called themselves friends. We opened up the underworld to the ones we love so well. So tell me gentlemen, is it right that we send him to a cell? If he drink, why you taught him. And he errs, you showed him how. So I ask you, is it right to go and condemn a man? And before you reach your verdict on what this man has done, be sure you didn't lead him down the road where he stands all alone. Now gentlemen, that's my story. My testimony stands. This man is my own brother and the case is in your hands. Those empty friendship and frivolous hours and too many parties and too many pals. [cheers and applause] Can you play this for me? Well, I sure will. Thank you. Say, anybody out there baseball fans? [cheering] Oh, boy. You know, that's something that I really like to do is listen to them ballgames on the radio, especially when we're driving along from town to town. I never drive myself. I always have some other fella to do the driving. And I don't much care what ballgame it is, really. I got no hometown team. I mean, when you're on the road all the time like I am, it gets so you can't even remember if you've got a hometown. But I guess it's all us drifters, you know, all the people who got no team of their own, always end up rooting for them Brooklyn Dodgers, the Bums. [applause] Hoo-ee. You know, the way my life's been going, sometimes I feel just like them Brooklyn Dodgers. Well, you remember two years ago back in '50 when they lost the pennant in the last inning of the last game of the season. Cost me 50 bucks. [laughs] HANK WILLIAMS: And last year was the same thing. They're ahead 4-1. They're going into the ninth and they lose it 5-4. Now, this year, they did better, way better. They didn't lose 'til the last game of the World Series. Well, maybe next year. Now, this next song is called "You Win Again." Thought I forgot your request, didn't you, honey? Well, I didn't write it for the Bums, but I think tonight, I'm going to dedicate it to them. To the Bums and all the bums. All them folks always seem to end up losing right in the last inning. Take it away. MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "YOU WIN AGAIN" The news is out all over town that you've been seen a-runnin' round. Oh, I know that I should leave, but then I just can't go you win again. That is such a beautiful song. It's about my most favorite, I think. Don't you just think it's just wonderful, Jackie? I don't know. I kind of like [inaudible] better. Uh, so cute. HANK WILLIAMS: --but me. Just trusting you. Well, babe all I got left in this world is the wife and you. You know, sometimes I wished I only had you. And you're so pretty. Sound so sweet. And never talk mean to me. And I'm sorry for your victim now for soon his head like mine will bow. He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again. 'Cause you have no heart. You have no shame. You take true love and give the blame. Oh, I guess that I should not complain. Oh, I love you still. You win again. [cheers and applause] Yes, sir. That's-- that "You Win Again," that's about as true as I can write it, you know? I always write my songs about what's happened to me. See, when I say, I got the blues-- hoo-wee. [laughter] You better believe it, boy. I mean, I could get the blues better than any man alive. [laughter] I mean, if your woman ain't left you alone and you wishing that she would-- well, like my new wife-- name of Billie Jean. God. Why, I loved her so much I married her three times. [laughter] Well, two times on the stage at the New Orleans Municipal Auditorium. But now that we're all hitched up real good and proper, why, she can be mean and ornery sometimes, though. She calls it taking care of me. [crowd murmurs] For instance, she's always smashing my bottles. I mean, how's a man to live without he's got a bottle or two around the house? [crowd murmurs in agreement] The other night I come home, I seen her pouring a bottle of my best Jim Beam right down the toilet. [crowd groans] I only kept it around for my back pain anyways. [laughter] She even found a bottle I had hid in my old pair of cowboy boots. And the one I had taped inside of my guitar? [laughter] And a little bitty one I had hid in the radio there, in there with the tubes and the wires and such? All on account that she couldn't get Wheeling, West Virginia WWVA real good. [laughter] So she had to go look inside of it. Just plain mean and ornery. But I believe everybody gets what they deserve in this life. And sometimes it don't look like that, but things ain't always like they seem. Now, Billie Jean, she's my second one. You take my first wife, Audrey-- boy, you people are lucky you never met her. [laughter] Why, I loved her better than any man ought to love any woman. Now, she's got my house, my money, my kid, and my heart. Ask me if I still love my used-to-be wife, I'll lie and say no. [playing guitar] Today I passed you on the street. [cheers and applause] And my heart fell at your feet. I can't help it if I'm still in love with you. Somebody else was by your side. And he looked so satisfied. I can't help it if I'm still in love with you. A picture from the past came slowly stealing as I brushed your arm and walked so close to you. And suddenly, I got that old time feeling. I can't help it if I'm still in love with you. It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you. And he'll hold you the way I used to do. Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you. I can't help it if I'm still in love with you. [cheers and applause] Well, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, you'd think that woman's got everything, right? She made me miserable and still ended up with everything. But I figure I'm still gonna win out in the long run, because you see, in 100 years from now, if people still listen to my records, god willing-- why, they're gonna to know everything there is to know about that woman and me, because I wrote it all down right from the start. I guess when you look at all them songs in order, you know, it's kind of like, well, a play that y'all might read in a book. Well, here, I'll play-act it for you now. Now, Act One, that's when you're still hoping. Well, you know how it is. You see a pretty little gal walking down the street, and only thing you can say is something like this. Say, hey, good-lookin'. Say, what you got cooking? How's about cooking something up with me? Say, hey, sweet baby. Say, don't you think maybe we could find us a brand new recipe? I got a hot rod Ford and a $2 bill. And I know a spot right over the hill. They got soda pop and the dancing's free. So if you wanna have fun, come along with me. I say, hey, good looking. Say, what you got cooking? How's about cooking something up with me? And then things start to look like they're really gonna work out. Well, I met my future bride today. And her name is Kathy Mae. Rootie Tootie. Rootie Tootie. HANK WILLIAMS: Oh, Rootie Tootie. Rootie Tootie. Yeah, Rootie Tootie, she's my Sunday gal. Well, she's got purty eyes of blue. And she thinks I'm purty too. Wicky-wacky. Rootie Tootie. Oh, Rootie Tootie. Rootie Tootie. Yeah, Rootie Tootie, she's my Monday gal. Well, you should see the people stare when she walks all across the square. Bouncy-bouncy. Rootie Tootie. Oh, whoopsie-daisy. Rootie Tootie. Yeah, Rootie Tootie, she's my Tuesday gal. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Then comes Act Two, and that's when you start to see the way it really is. If you loved me half as much as I love you, oh, you wouldn't worry me half as much as you do. You're nice to me when there's no one else around. You always build me up to let me down. If you missed me half as much as I missed you, oh, you wouldn't stay away half as much as you do. I know that I would never be this blue if you only loved me half as much as I love you. And then finally, you see that woman for what she really is. Your cheating heart-- [crowd erupting in cheers] --will make you weep. You'll cry and cry and try to sleep. But sleep won't come the whole night through. Your cheating heart will tell on you. When tears come down like falling rain, you'll toss around and call my name. You'll walk the floor the way I do. Your cheating heart will tell on you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. He must know my wife. [cheers and applause] Then comes Act Three. And that's when there ain't no more. And well, you just keep hoping that the curtain's gonna fall. You know, it's funny, but that's the kind of song that you can't lose. I mean, the ones that stay with you-- the songs that you write when you're all alone again. [playing guitar] We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold. The pastures were green and the meadows were gold. Our love was in flower as summer grew on. Her love, like the leaves, now has withered and gone. The roses have faded. There's frost at my door. The birds in the morning don't sing anymore. The grass in the valley has started to die. And out in the darkness, the whippoorwill cries. Alone and forsaken by fate and by man-- oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand. Oh, please understand. Where has she gone to? Where can she be? She may have forsaken some other like me. She promised to honor, to love, and obey. Each vow was a plaything that she threw away. The darkness has fallen. The sky has turned grey. A hound in the distance has started to bay. I wonder, I wonder what she's thinking of. Forsaken, forgotten, without any love. Alone and forsaken by fate and by man-- oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand. Oh, please understand. It's funny how it always seems to turn out the same way every single time. [cheers and applause] Carl, don't you remember me? Oh, yeah, of course I remember you. Catch you later. Some dressing room they got for us here, huh? Just like home. MAN: Good-lookin' women out there tonight, though, boy. Did you see that pretty little gal sitting up front? Phew! Well, boys, before we go any further, I just want to tell you that the waitress is mine. But I brought you a little something from my private collection as a sort of consolation prize. MAN: Mighty fine, mighty fine, have a look at that. MAN: My, my, my. MAN: Helluva crowd. Oh, god, I'm bushed. Feels good to get these boots off, I tell you. Feeling all right, Hank? Not too bad. Only thing I regret is not killing that fool horse I fell off. MAN: Hey, Teddy, that was some fine picking tonight, boy. Mighty fine. MAN: I thank you, sir. MAN: Of course, now, it might make it just a little better if you'd just turn on your amp. [laughter] MAN: And by way, what string you got broken there, boy? Is that the C, G, or D? [laughter] You guys never gonna let that one go. I know. MAN: Let me have a look at that guitar a minute. [woman singing in distance] [laughter] Hi. Um, you all right? Can I get you anything, Mr. Williams? No. No, thanks, honey. I just want a minute alone by myself. Thanks. Oh. Oh, I didn't mean you. I just-- I just mean-- Oh, yeah. What I could really use right about now is a little drink. Oh, I know what you mean, but I'm not supposed to-- Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean. I've been hearing that since I was about 13 years old. Guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Oh, come on. You can't be any older than I am. Well, I sure feel a whole lot older. I just wish I could smile like the way you can. [giggles] Ah, that's cute. [laughs] Can't help smiling, that's all. Well-- well, you-- you know, you could smile too if you wanted to. Yeah, well, you just smile for the both of us, honey. Thank you. [music playing in distance] MUSIC - PATTI PAGE, "TENESSEE WALTZ" PATTI PAGE: [SINGING] --my darling, to the Tennessee waltz-- MAN: Need more change? Get them ash trays. MAN: You're gonna have to check that guitar against the steel before we up again, make sure it's in tune. MAN: Yeah. I think some dancing. How are you, Hank? Not bad. First a bit flat there, buddy. MAN: Yeah, I can hear it. [tuning guitar] Sure could use a drink right now. Anybody got a drink? Can't anybody hear what I'm saying? MAN: Thought you never touched the stuff. I want a drink. I need a drink, and I want one right now. MAN: Hank, you don't need to-- Don't tell me what I need. OK, OK, I'll get you one. MAN: Thank god. Back's acting up, ain't it? Doc, you're the only one that understands me. [music playing from jukebox] Now, don't that feel better? Yeah, it's coming down. You just give them a good show. This sure is one god awful way to spend New Year's. I wonder what Billie Jean's doing right now. Probably wondering what I'm doing. Well, Billie Jean, you purty young thing, your old rambling boy Hank, he's lost somewhere's out in Highway 11, between hell and eternity, just a-pining for some human company, for some arms wrapped around him good and tight. Come on. You've been working all night. I seen you. Come on. Come on and sit down a little. Thanks. MAN: Hey, Teddy. Rootie Tootie. Let's go, boys. Can I get you a drink? Oh, no, thanks. Can I get you anything? Some more peanuts or a glass of water? Well, that's real nice of you, but no thanks, hon. Oh, my name's Betty Anne. Hank. Yeah, OK. Was you wondering when I was gonna get around to asking you? No, I-- I was just telling you. You got five minutes, Hank. You ever get nervous? Oh, not about playing. About women sometimes. Oh, come on. Bet you get all the women you want, don't you? Well, mostly I-- I get all the women who want me. Oh, I don't mean you. I just want some company, you know. Yeah. [knocking] BARTENDER: Betty Anne, get your can out here. Well, I gotta go now. Oh, yeah? It'll be all right. Oh, yeah. Say, uh, do you ever pray? Pray? No, not since I was a little girl. Why? Nothing. You better hurry along or your boss gonna skin you alive. No, nobody's ever gonna skin me alive. See you in a bit when you come out. [door closes] [cheers and applause] You can't say that about her, you son of a-- What are you-- drop your hands! Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Come on, come on. What do you think you're doing here? Come on outside. Yeah, yeah! Damn Yankee! Ah, come here. Lemme at him! He's nothing but a damn Yankee. MAN: I don't like him shoving me around. Oh, my goodness. Can I help? It's OK. I'll take care of him. I can get him out. This happens all the time. [strumming guitar softly] I thought everyone had left. Oh, that don't matter to me, man. Come on in. Don't bother me. I can't start my cleaning till all the folks have gone. Don't bother me none. Here, try some of this, buddy. Go on, go on. Try it. It's good stuff. Sit down. Sit down. Take a load off. Can't work, you might as well sit down. [playing guitar] [SINGING] Well, I've been in the doghouse so doggone long, when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong. I've been-- [trails off] You know, my wife would say you've got to half the world on your shoulder. Oh, man. If she said that, she'd be dead wrong. I mean, what do I gotta be sad about, you know? I'm rich and I'm famous and I've got a pretty little wife, the cutest little boy you ever want to see. Money in the bank. Hell, I got everything, man. You know what I mean. [SINGING] Oh, I remember when you was so nice and sweet, but something's changed. You'd rather fight than eat. [laughter] [singing] You know what I mean? Here, why don't you go on and try this? Oh, shoot, man. Come on. I bet you can play it real good. Come on, try it out. Oh. Come on, go on. Here, look. Tell you what I do. I'll take-- you take the guitar, I'll take the bottle. There you go. Just take it there. Play me something now. [strumming guitar] I got one for you. All right. [playing guitar] [SINGING] If the wife and I are fussing, baby, that's all right, cause me and that woman got a license to fight. Why don't you mind your own business? [SINGING] Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be minding mine. The woman on our party line's a nosy old thing. She picks up her receiver when she knows it's our ring. Why don't you mind your own business? Mind your own business. MAN: Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Cause if you mind your business then you won't be minding mine. I got a little gal. She wears her hair up high. The boys all whistle at her every time she walks by. Why don't you mind your own business? Mind your own business. Yeah, mind your own business. Mind your own business. Well, then you mind your own business, then you won't be minding mine. That right? [soloing on guitar] MAN: [SINGING] If want to honky tonk around till 2:00 or 3:00, well, baby, that's my headache. Don't you worry about me. Just mind your own business. Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Cause if you mind your business then you won't be minding mine. And if you mind your own business, it will keep you busy all the time. Hey. That's all right, man. [laughter] You play that pretty good. [band hitting final chord] [cheers and applause] WOMAN: We want Hank. Where are you, babe? Where is he? When's he gonna come back? OK, hold your horses, Jackie. [crowd complaining] [band playing] That-- man, that big old catfish weighed near 14 pounds. [knocking] Come on in. Well, now, isn't this nice? Listen, they are gonna start throwing chairs in there-- - Uh-huh. - You better go on. I'll be right there. Look, I'll be there. Uh-huh. Come on. I think she's real mad at me. I'll be right there. I'll see you then, man. - Well, howdy, stranger. - See? I told you he was coming back. They're gonna hate me. No one is gonna hate you, Hank. You just go on out there and give them a good show. Come on. I can't. I just can't. I can't disappoint the folks. Just can't-- it's the first of many shows. I gotta-- I just gotta-- [chatter] [crowd quiets down] MAN: Oh-oh. MAN: Talk. MAN: Come on, Hank. MAN: All right, I think we're kinda drunk. [hank hiccups] You can do it, Hank. MAN: Come on. [chatter] WOMAN: You're doing fine, son. You'll be fine. MAN: That's it. Now he's good. MAN: Have a chair, Hank. Oh, come on. I ain't gonna do that no how. Sit down? MAN: Looks like your wife missed the bottle backstage, Hank. [laughter] Hoo-wee. OK. [giggles] [laughter] He thinks he's taking care of me. They all think they're taking care of me. Poor Hank. That's all I get. Poor Hank. Well, poor old Hank is paying his way in this world, I'll tell you that. [crowd approves] And I'll stand on my own two feet. Gracious me. Lonesome, loosey drifter. He's out of control here! [laughter] [crowd approving] [playing guitar] WOMAN: Yeah. MAN: Yeah. [singing faintly] [SINGING] The rose I wore was red. [applause] But today I'm sayin' my first prayer. Mama's lying on her dying bed. I just told Mama good bye. Mother's Day has turned to night. Like the flowers of May, she withered away. And my red rose is turning white. This is the [trails off] I just wanna make sure nobody's feeling too happy. [laughter] Well, you know that's the way you gonna like it. Everybody-- everybody thinks they always wanna hear happy songs all the time. I mean, if that's so, how come "Your Cheatin' Heart" is outselling "Rootie Tootie" five to one? [crowd responding] I don't know. Maybe it's because I feel the other side of life that much stronger, or maybe it's cause most folks ain't sure they're alive unless they're hurting. [crowd responding] Well, y'all are gonna really love this next song, because-- well, it's one of the most hurtin'-est songs I ever did write, and it's probably the one that more people have made hits out of than any other. I mean, it sure didn't hurt Tony Bennett none. [laughter] [band playing] [applause] I've tried so hard-- [cheering, applause] --my dear, to show that you're my everything. Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme. A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart. Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart. Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue. And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do. In anger, unkind words are spoke that make the teardrops fall. Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart. Had too much milk, Hank? [laughter] MAN: No wonder the Opry fired you, Hank. Wish we'd get somewheres. She taking me to the Opry. We're getting closer. Sure am tired of all this driving. It won't be long now. Long now-- that's the truth. Not unless I straighten myself out real quick. Now, where was I? Don't ask me. [laughter] That boy's got a bigger mouth than Huey Long. [laughter] You starting to bother me, son. All right, man. I was telling you-- we were talking about women, and I was telling you about my wife. Well, we've become such good friends here tonight, I tell you, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna play ya a flip side now, do you a little song I wrote and tell you how I feel, especially when I come in off the road off a summer-long tour. So boys, can you give me that now? [band playing] MAN: Yee-hee! OK! Jackie. You was too good to take my ol' bet before. Oh, no. Not this one. Not again. Well, here's one for you. [screaming] [ruckus] MAN: Get that idiot outta here! MAN: Well, I-- I was only having fun. OK, everybody. You just settle down now. Have a good time, you hear me? Everybody have a good time. Thanks, Pete. Half as cool as the lot'n of us. Hey, that's OK, buddy. Happens all the time. But you know, one thing you learn when you-- when you're on the road all the time is how to handle a rowdy crowd. I mean, the only thing we've thought to do was to try out-rowdy them your own self. [cheering] This here's a song I always found to be about the best out-rowdiest that I ever did write. I want to do it for you right now. Come on, boys. [band playing] [SINGING] Oh, goodbye, Joe. We gotta go, me oh my oh. Oh, me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou. Oh, my Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun down the bayou. Well, jambalaya and a crawfish pie and the file gumbo, because tonight I'm gonna see my chere amie, oh. Oh, pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay, oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun down on the bayou. Well, Thibodaux to Fontaineaux, the place is buzzing. Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen. Well, they're dressed in style. They go hog wild, me oh my oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun down on the bayou. Well, jambalaya and a crawfish pie and the file gumbo, cause tonight I'm gonna see my chere amie, oh. Oh, pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay, oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun down on the bayou. Let it go, everybody! [fiddle solo] Well, I'll settle down far from town, buy me a pirogue. I'm gonna catch all the doggone fish in the doggone bayou. I'll swap my mo to buy my Yvonne what she need, oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun down on the bayou. Well, jambalaya, crawfish pie, and the file gumbo cause tonight I'm gonna see my chere amie, oh. Oh, pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay, oh. Hey, son of a gun, we having fun on the bayou. [cheering, applause] Thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you. Phew! Wasn't that something, boy? Thank you. Oh, thank you. [whistling] Oh, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. You know, that's about the closest that I ever come to writing what y'all could call a Cajun song. I always liked that kind of Cajun music. Every time we're playing down there, Louisiana or thereabouts. Now, I was kind of worried at first at them Cajuns. They might not like it, but they seemed to take to it right off. Hell, the first time we ever played up in Baton Rouge, they was throwing $20 bills right up on the stage. It's true. Of course, that ain't nothing like a real Cajun two step. I mean, that's the kind where, you know, the music gets a hold on your feet and there ain't nothing you can do about it. I'm telling you. But I mean, music ain't meant to be talked about, right? So come on, boys. Let's give this here crowd a listen to what a real old-fashioned Cajun two-step is like. We'll let her fly. [music playing] Come on up here and dance for us. Come on. What'd you stop playing for? Come on? St-- I got-- I got some real good dancers here. Come on. Strike up and play. Let's go. [music starting back up] [hollering] [music stops, people gasp] [groans] Oh, I thought-- there's got to be lights up ahead there somewheres. Rest. That's right. [exhales] I'm sure we're lost. [applause] You know, sometimes I figure, being on the road all the time, playing these one-nighters week after week, you know, that's about as close to hell as you can get to on this earth. Well, maybe this way, the good Lord'll figure I already done my time and send me straight to heaven. [laughter] Oh, it might seem funny to you that a man that's lived the sort of life I've lived should be talking about heaven when all I really have got a right to talk about is hell. But you know, somewheres along the road, ol' Luke the drifter, he got religion. Yes, sir, I mean-- there ain't that many things in this life that I am positive about, but I know as sure as I'm standing right here that there's a God out there somewheres. [crowd murmuring agreement] Because I mean, this can't be all there is to it, if it all ends up in a pine box. See, when I was just a little boy, my mama used to take me to revival meetings every Sunday. Well, she used to play the organ up at the Mount Olive Church. And well, I used to sing in the choir. But the thing I'd mostly like to do would be to listen to them gospel preachers every Sunday morning, because they could preach the gospel so's their words would make your blood run cold. I can still hear the voice of them preachers calling out to me, talking about Jesus. Right now, my friends, I want to tell you about Jesus. I want to tell you about Jesus Christ. I want to tell you about Jesus Christ the savior. And I want to tell you about Jesus Christ, the savior of mankind. Hallelujah! And I want to tell you about Jesus Christ the savior of mankind who lived on this earth. Jesus Christ, the savior of mankind who lived on this earth and died on the cross. Hallelujah, brother! MAN: Amen! I want to tell you about Jesus Christ, the savior of mankind who lived on this earth and died on the cross for you and your sins. WOMAN: Praise Jesus! Tell them, Hank. And I want to tell you about the burning fire of hell-- the burning fire of hell that awaits for you and you and you, yes, and you and you unless you repent. WOMAN: Praise you, Jesus. HANK WILLIAMS: Unless you repent right now. Amen. Right now, on your hands and your knees begging forgiveness. Hallelujah. HANK WILLIAMS: Forgiveness for your miserable sins-- to what I'm telling you about is pain-- WOMAN: Amen. HANK WILLIAMS: Pain and sorrow until the end of time. WOMAN: I love you, Brother Williams. HANK WILLIAMS: And I want to tell you about joy-- joy, happiness, tears of relief when you rush into the arms of your savior. Hallelujah! When your rush from the pain, and the sorrow, and the darkness into the blinding light, the blinding light of heaven-- can you imagine it? Oh, yes! HANK WILLIAMS: Can you see the light? Yes! HANK WILLIAMS: Can you see the light standing right there? Oh, yes! MAN: Bless you, Hank. A light infinitely more powerful than the blinding blaze of the sun-- a beacon calling for you. WOMAN: Hallelujah! HANK WILLIAMS: The lights streaming from the bleeding hands of Jesus. Oh, Lord! From the bleeding hands of Jesus Christ, the savior of mankind who lived on this earth and died on the cross for you and your miserable sins. WOMAN: Praise Jesus. [SINGING] I wandered, so aimless, life filled with sin. And I wouldn't let my dear savior in. [band joining] And then Jesus came like a stranger in the night. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. Oh, I My the light, I saw the light. No more darkness, no more night. Now, I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. Well, just like a blind man, I wandered along. And worries and fears I claimed for my own. And then like a blind man that God gave back his sight, praise the Lord, I saw the light. Hey, I saw the light. I saw the light. No more darkness, no more night. Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. Well, I was a fool to wander and stray, cause straight is the gate and narrow's the way. And now I have traded the wrong for the right. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. I saw the light. I saw the light. No more darkness, no more night. Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. Praise the Lord, I saw the light. Oh, maybe there ain't no light. I tried. Lord knows how hard I tried to believe. And you know, some mornings, I wake up, and it's almost there. MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "I'M SO LONESOME I COULD CRY" Hear that lonesome whippoorwill. He sounds too blue to fly. That midnight train is whining low. I'm so lonesome I could cry. The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky. And as I wonder where you are, I'm so lonesome I could cry. Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves begin to die? That means he's lost the will to live. I'm so lonesome I could cry. Lord, must I go on remembered? Must they look still be turned away from me? Each day brings a fresh load of care, fresh misery to my heart. Must I ever be the sport of my enemies? Look upon me, oh, Lord, my God. Listen to me. Give light to these eyes before they close in death. Do not let my enemies claim the mastery, and my persecutors triumph over my fall. I cast myself on thy mercy. [WHISPERING] And I saw the light. I saw the light. But you know, I tried so hard to give up looking for that light. I just can't. That's all. I just can't. [band playing quietly] You'll meet many just like me along life's busy street with shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat. They're souls that live within the past, where sorrow plays all parts, and a living death is all that's left to men with broken hearts. Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will break with it. Lord, why must these living dead know pain with every breath? Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts. And with hope all gone, they walk alone, these man with broken hearts. Now, you've never walked in that man's shoes or seen things through his eyes, or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies. Some were paupers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts. But in their shame, they're all the same, these men with broken hearts. And even sleep brings no relief to all these men who curse their birth. They have no dreams of happiness in heaven or on earth. Well, how can a man have faith in God when faith in man departs? And to those who weep, death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts. Well, that's all. I don't want else to say, except good night and God bless you. Say a prayer for me. Happy New Year's, everybody. [bell tolling in distance] MUSIC - HANK WILLIAMS, "SETTING THE WOODS ON FIRE" Comb your hair and paint and powder. You act proud, and I'll act prouder. You sing loud, and I'll sing louder. Tonight we're setting the woods on fire. You're my gal and I'm your feller. Dress up in your frock of yeller.
