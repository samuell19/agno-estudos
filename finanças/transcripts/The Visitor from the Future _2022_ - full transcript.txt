Turn back! Meltdown: Reactor 3. Evacuate personnel. Come on, come on, come on! - We gotta go! - Don't panic, I got this. Look, you just push here. And we're screwed. Come on. Push it! It's jammed. It's an old 2022 plant. Some analog program must reboot the system. Hey look! Shit. Yellow or blue? My instinct says blue. - Why blue? - It's reassuring. It isn't, yellow is! It's chicks, the sun, life. Depends how you look at it. Do not push the... What's that? This tramp appeared out of nowhere. He's telling us something. I can't hear you, sir. ...could destroy the human race. You're too far away. What if I scream? Ice cream? Call him over. Come help out. Fuck! Run, run, run! Jeez, what a great start! - Hear me now? - That's better! I was saying... Don't push the blue button! Why not? You didn't hear a thing? The plant will blow up! Are you sure? Yes! I'm from the future. What did he say? "Don't push blue, I'm from the future." Let's quiz him to see if he's telling the truth. We don't have time. - OK, we believe you. - Cool. I have a job usually. So we push yellow? Read the instructions. It's all Chinese to us. Aren't you engineers? Yes, but it's in Chinese! Show him. I'll be back. He vanished as if by magic. And he's back with a guy. This is Mr. Wong. Show him the card. What's that? Speak into this. Machine translation. That thing is in Cantonese. I speak Mandarin. I'll be back. We're going to die. We can trust him, he's from the future. Remember me? I saw you a second ago. A second for you! I spent six months learning Mandarin. Cantonese. I'll be back. Yep, we're going to die. - Done! - Learnt Cantonese? I went into the past and spoke to the plant's designer. And? It's the yellow button. - Sure? - Go on! Shit! Time Patrol. You're under arrest! Hurry up! Two guys are here, the tramp's vanished. I'm lost. Yellow button? No, don't! The blue will blow us sky high. Ignore the tramp. It's a trap! The guy's a terrorist. The Time Patrol is here to help! What were you planning to do? We wanted - well, I did - to push the blue button. There you go! Blue is reassuring. Reassuring! That's just what I said. Great! - So I push it? - Not yet! Why? Wait till we've gone, OK? That's weird. It's the protocol. What are we waiting for exactly? A clear signal from us. Just wait. Wait, OK? OK, hit the blue button. Great, guys! Overload imminent! Awesome! THE VISITOR FROM THE FUTURE Axomako cloud crosses Paris area for fifth time Explosion of Axomako's historic nuclear power plant Numerous victims. Who is to blame? Deputy Alibert greenlights Axomako nuclear plant Right, I think I've covered everything. Any questions? Thank you, Mr. Alibert. Will the plant benefit the region? It will have significant benefits. It will provide employment. Remember that nuclear is the best clean energy source. So if there's global warming, it won't be our fault! Sir? What is your relationship with Axamako? I like Axomako. They make good plants. They have proved that in China and will soon do so here. Any more questions? Don't be shy. Go ahead. Mr. Alibert! Why does Axomako use obsolete technology in its new plants? The technology is not obsolete, and you're not a journalist. How did you get in? In 70 years' time, the technology will be 100 years old. It's a huge risk, isn't it? I disagree. It's not a risk. Over the next 100 years, we'll find solutions. Life will be good. And we'll go to the bakery by jetpack! That'll be so cool! Mr. Alibert! Do you care about the planet? Young lady, I care about my region, and my region is on the planet... so I care about my planet. Thank you. Have a good afternoon. Film me. Don't touch her! Sit down! - Did you get that? - Do it again. I said to leave her alone! Goodbye. Charlie, stop! Stop that! I'm gonna smash your face in! The bastard's pulling my hair! Film him! Good job, guys! It wasn't that bad. Lucien filmed the whole thing. They took his camera. Yeah, but I removed the SD card and shoved it up my ass! - You're a genius. - Sure am! I don't want to post it. Getting arrested wasn't the plan. You can't be serious! Everyone will talk about us. I want them to talk about the plant. Only the message counts. A message needs a face. Otherwise we won't be heard. - Charlie's too ugly. - Gratuitous! I do the filming, so I can't. That leaves you. What's the plan? The best is for you to go to jail. Perfect! What? Hunger strikes are effective too. Just go on hunger strike. What will you do? Launch a hashtag campaign. You know, #FreeAlice or #SaveAlice. I can't decide which. I get the short straw, huh? He stuck an SD card up his ass. 64GB it was too! I refuse to be your spokesperson, martyr or whatever. I'll fight for the cause, but I'm nobody. What a pain. Your father's here. Come on, let's go. - You drink too much. - That's why I have a driver. - Shall I drop Alice home? - My place, Fabio. You can sleep in your old room. If you say so. Interesting friends you have. They're not my friends. I met them on a forum. Internet! Don't believe everything you read. Give me a break. Everybody knows Axomako builds shoddy plants. They're hiring you when your term's up. It's classic, it's called... A "revolting" door. That's it. How about some music? Look, Alice, I'm concerned about your future. - I'm doing fine. - With whose money? The rebel lets me pay her rent! What would your internet pals say? I love this track. Listen to that bass. Turn that crap off! Right away, sir. Well done for getting yourself noticed! I don't do it for that. I know, I know, it's for the planet. I'm not an idiot. I care about these things too. Your mother was just like you. Totally committed. She didn't change you! She didn't have time, as you know. What does that mean? Nothing. Go on, say it. Say what? Stop the sly comments about Mom! You do it all the time! Drop me here, Fabio. All right. Shit. Home, Fabio. And without music. Hello? So that's why you had secret info! You're his daughter. Keep it to yourselves. And don't post the video. I'm nobody. Who are you? A little daddy's girl who's bored and wants fun? It's just a hobby for you! I want him to realize what he's doing is wrong. - And does he? - I guess not. Look, Alice, either commit 100% or stay in your bubble! I am committed, but I don't know what to do. We have to catch him out! Prove Axomako is hiring him when his term's up. It'll be a mega political scandal! Great! How do I do that? You swipe his computer. No way! I can't. Alice, don't be a pain! Think of others for once. We're doing this for the planet! If you refuse, we'll post the video and tell everyone he's your dad. Shove the video up your ass! I already have, Alice. Right. OK. ECOLOGY OR DEATH Hi honey! How nice to be in your workshop! Show us what you're doing. I'm almost done. - Ice what? - It's my favorite. "Ice Caps, the Final Meltdown!" Watch out for the riot squad, you and your bump. They won't charge us! Right, OK. You're laughing. Look. You're so beautiful. I love that look. - I love you. - You do? Of course I do! Me too. Who are you? You first! - Me? - Yes. I'm nobody. OK. Great mood here! Right, listen up. This is very important. My name's... What the hell's going on? - Alice? - Dad. Who's that tramp? No idea. He was here when I came in. He was after your computer. Why are you here? To make up with me? That's right. Sorry, I thought you'd come to steal my computer too. - Are you nuts? - Robbed by my own daughter! Well, did you? Yes. But I knocked him out. - Your accomplice? - I don't know the guy. - I'm calling the police. - Good idea. Wait! What are you going to say? - Time Patrol. - Don't be surprised! What the hell's that? Where are they? - I can't see them! - Wrong way, Victor. There they are. - I've got him. - He isn't armed. So what? Right, listen to me. I'm from the future. If Gilbert builds his plant, here's what's gonna happen. I'm taking him out. Fuck! You idiot! He's mine. Dad! Yeah, well if he moves... Fuck, it hurts! Get off me, you! Don't touch my dad. He's taking the target! Hurry! Freeze! Goddamn it! The boss will be super pissed off. I'm ratting you guys out. Drink o'clock! - Dad! - All right, Alice? Get off me! Leave me alone! Get off me! Why bring him here? Who's that? Nobody. Deal with her, I'll deal with the dad. Hey there! There's no need to worry. - Come back! - Run, Alice. Run! What is this? Trapdoor Room opening. What's that? How did it go? Louise messed up. She missed her target. I did not. I got one. - In the leg. - Attaboy! Unfortunately it was the guy we were supposed to protect. They got away. They're so smart. No, they're not! They're less lame than us. Than you. - She's mad she messed up. - Typical! I did not mess up. Let's see what the boss says. Is she pissed off? I'm not pissed off. I'm confused. In a nutshell, Louise tried to shoot the troublemaker but Matteo stopped her. Then Victor shot at them. He missed and hit Gilbert Alibert, who was kidnapped around the year 2555. Thank you, Richard. I would like to point out it was mainly Matteo's fault. Thank you, Richard. Victor should not have been on the mission. He's a danger to himself and others. Thanks again. Matteo, how do you explain your actions? Our mission is not to shoot suspects on sight. He is the worst criminal our patrol has ever dealt with. He and his accomplices are our priority. See that, Constance? I put his face on the big screen. The madman thinks he's saving the world! He could destroy the space-time continuum. You know what that means? Course I do. I know all that stuff. Louise is replacing you as mission leader. Sorry? Awesome. I mean, affirmative. Matteo, you can't leave a briefing! Let him go, Richard. Can I leave too? Louise, I want you to find Gilbert Alibert and eliminate potential enemies. Tough job. I mean, you bet! I mean, affirmative. Don't make me regret my decision. Constance, there's something else. Gilbert Alibert wasn't the only one kidnapped. Alice, are you awake? Dad? - Where are you? - Here! You OK? - Where are we? - I don't know. It's desolate out there. Belgium maybe? It isn't Belgium, it's Paris. Only different. We have to get out of here! They're terrorists. Negotiate with them. Why me? Because hippies are your department. Is your leg OK? Yes, fine. They tried to patch it up. It's a botch job. Their hands were filthy. I bet I have tetanus. - Someone's coming. - Beat them up! That's easy for you to say. Hey there. We can hear everything by the way. I fixed you this. Enjoy! That's food? Born complainer, huh? Of course it's food. The best you can get here. Move outside your 21st-century hipster comfort zone. This is the future. You can forget your brunches. This is brunch now. What was that? Where are we? In the future. What are you on about? It's awful outside. That's why we don't go. But don't worry, I brought my consoles with me. Want to play FIFA? It's a nice idea but I don't plan to stay long in this prison. You have to take us home. We'll see. Only this isn't a prison, it's my bedroom. - You live here? - Yeah. I used to be like you. I came from the "present" then I met this guy. I traveled in time and it changed my life forever. What did you do before? I just played video games. And now? So if this isn't a prison, can we leave? Ask the others. I don't get to decide. I'm number three in the hierarchy. Out of three. You can discuss it in the lab. Come on. I want out too! Hello, Alice. Remember me? You tried to beat me up. Several times. - Do you have a name? - Sure. But I didn't get the chance to tell you. OK, so my name... People are looking for us. I advise you to let us go! You want to leave already? The door's there. Really? Right. Alice, follow me. Excuse me. The button on the side. I thought so. Thanks! Didn't anyone tell you? The future is full of zombies. Why? Excellent question! Hello, I'm Dr. Henry Castafolte. How did the undead, commonly known as zombies, appear on our planet? First we must distinguish them from the infected, very commonly known as running zombies. Why running zombies? - Because they run. - Correct! The zombies you saw are undead. They are walking zombies. - Because they walk. - Did I ask you, Raph? You interrupted me. How rude! Put that biscuit down. Do it. Why are they zombies? Radiation. Is that all? The real question is, why the radiation, Gilbert? I was right. Your plant will explode, Dad. It isn't mine, it's Axomako's. I'm not to blame for all the disasters! He's right. Many nuclear disasters were caused by earthquakes. And the Cat War. The what? I didn't cause all the radiation. Where we're from, nuclear is the lesser evil. You'd rather I built a coal plant? That isn't the problem. I simply tried to optimize the budget in a highly competitive market. All safety standards were met. I'm not to blame if it wasn't renovated. It's never your fault. That's the problem! You bequeath your risky ventures to future generations and hope we'll magically fix things! Spoiler alert: We have no powers. We don't even have toilets, we crap in buckets! That's the future. The future? How we do know this is the future? Where are your jetpacks? What are you up to? We're going out. Hang on, what about the zombies? What zombies? Wait! He's super ugly. - That's me, Mom. - So it is! - What's that? - Where are we? It's come even closer. Get out. Gilbert, we'll keep it simple. If you build your plant, here's what's gonna happen! What's that? It's what happens when you optimize your budget in a competitive market. The blast cloud drifted across the Atlantic. Everybody figured it'd be America's problem. They'd forgotten something. What? The Earth is round. That's dumb. Every 70 years the cloud circles the globe and kills 50% of the population. It's bigger every time. - It's really big. - It sure is. No one will survive this time. Do you understand the problem now, Gilbert? Yes, it's perfectly clear. Great! That suits me. Stop! Are you insane? - He said he understood. - Right. Don't kill him! It's to save the human race. Isn't there another solution? There was! I tried to steal his computer, to create a scandal. But someone stopped me. I wasn't to know. It was my idea too! I don't feel good. In your present, the Time Patrol will find you and keep you on the Tracks of Time. Sorry, Gilbert. Don't, don't... Dad? Dad! Dad, wake up. - I can't kill an unconscious man. - Hardly sporting. I've got an idea. The adults are talking! For the Time Patrol not to notice a time change, it has to be an internal change. It's astonishing but he's right. If an individual undergoes psychological change, if they experience an epiphany, they can change the course of Time and the patrol can't stop them. Please. I'm sure he can change. I'm not. There's no time anyway. He wasn't always like this. If the patrol finds us, I'll take action. - Is that clear? - I understand. I'm not so sure. Let's get back. Dad! It's OK... Let me help you. Thanks, Raph. No, well, er... We'll do the thing. What? What I mean is, I think we can change your dad. If the Time Patrol doesn't catch us first. Hey, you! So... it's shoot-on-sight now? We've no time for diplomacy. Constance is counting on us. Ass licker! - Who are you? - The Time Patrol. Do you know them? Yes, I do. But why shoot me? You simply had to ask. Sorry. Do you know where they are? Yes, but I'm not telling you now. You've upset me. Good job, Louise! Look, tell us where they are then we'll tend to you. No. Treat me first. If he refuses to tell us, we shoot his other leg. Their lab is in the East Maze. That way, left, strong door with a fox on it. There you go! You simply had to ask. There we go! Richard says I'm dangerous but... East Maze? He said the East Maze. So it has to be east. Right, this way. It's gonna be a long day. Who's up for a drink? A cold one? Seriously? Are we buddies or hostages? You almost shot my dad. Saving the world isn't that simple. Yeah, I know. We're fighting the same fight. With different methods! That's right. You're an amateur, we're pros. If we're pros, pay me. You are paid, Raph. Where's the money? It pays for your room. Think I'd put you up for free? What I mean is, Alice, we don't really kill people. We never have. Or if we have, it wasn't for pleasure. Do zombies count? I get a kick out of killing them. Zombies don't count. Don't be so zombie-phobic. Give us a break! - What's the plan? - Right now? To have a drink. Our bar does great gnat's pee! Seriously. For my dad. Any ideas? Crossed wires, Alice. You said you had an idea. No, I did not. I said he could change. When Mom was still around, she could change his mind. Or so he says. I never knew her. Why? Did your mom...? In labor. Mr. Alibert? Your child is fine. But there were complications. Your wife hemorrhaged. She died. I bet he wished they'd saved Mom instead. We could... We're not bringing your mom back to life. Why not? It's too risky. If we save your mom and cancel the baby you, it'll create a paradox. - What? - A paradoxical thing! Forget it. - Thanks a lot! - What he means is, you'd exist without existing. You would be an aberration. Don't worry, Alice, I don't get this time stuff either. Your dad doesn't realize who the victims of his acts will be. There's us for starters. He doesn't care about you. He has to see real people. Civilians in distress, children... - That'd be great! - Let's go the Lair. Raph, shut it! What's the Lair? Nothing. I have a better idea. Damn, that's good! Good job! Great. - Hey, don't cheat! - Chill. What'll it be? - What whisky do you have? - We'll have water. Water? Tap water? Are you the Queen of Neo Versailles? Fucking hell! Drop it, Francis. They'll have the same. For the Queen! What do you do? I trade in bulk. Ah, a trader! What do you sell? I just told you: bulk! Do you have family? Yes. There's Didier, my father, my brother, my uncle... Let me guess, he's one and the same. Yep. Do you have kids? Want mine? They're going cheap. Boris, you promised them to me! You ate the last one I gave you. Yes, but I paid for it! Come on, let's go. Henry says he's working, but I think... - he's jerking off. - For sure. Is it safe to leave them alone? It's OK, Raph, I'm keeping an eye on them. - Two for one! - No thank you. At the very worst, Gilbert will die. Yes, but Alice is innocent. I'm not worried about her. She's a fast learner. I'm thinking of hiring her. She'll never agree. She's into saving the world. Maybe she'd like to go pro. I didn't think they'd be so weird. Don't worry, your plan is very smart. It is? Thanks. Buying time so the Time Patrol finds us! That isn't the plan. I want you to change. Come on, Alice, no one changes at 40! It says so on Facebook. But the cloud will kill them all. How awful! Régis won't get to eat Boris's kids. There'll be other victims too. I don't give a damn about them! I only care about you. Me? You don't even know me. But I'm your father! OK. What's my favorite series? Oh, come on, that's easy. It's... Franklin the Turtle. When I was 5, Dad! You're obsessed with your career! I know I've been working 24/7. But as a father, I have to secure our future. If you cared about the future, we wouldn't be here! What can I say? The party's screwed and I'm done for. Axomako plans to hire me. We'll be rolling in it. - You will be! - Who funds you? - I can fend for myself. - Sure! You can't even hold down a job. Pay your rent if you're a rebel. Or join your pals from the future! I'd like to, but I can't. The cloud's going to kill them. What did she say? - Be quiet. - Lost your nerve? They don't need to know. Listen up, guys! I've got some terrible news. - You're all going to die. - What? Smothered by a huge toxic cloud. He's to blame. His name's Gilbert. Down with Gilbert! Listen to me. Calm down, my friends. The drinks are on me! Nice try. Let's go! They're getting away! Who's paying? - Where to now? - Who cares! The patrol will find us. Put it on my tab. Don't take me for an idiot! I'm hard at work. I'm busy... I want to see hairless babes! Victor. The explosives. 10, 9... 5, 4... I can hear numbers. Only backwards. Get down! Come on! It's hot, hotta chocolatta! You OK, guys? Yeah, fine. Victor? A countdown. That's what those numbers were. Come on! Push harder! Come on. The surface isn't the safest place. If only we had jetpacks. The future's such a let-down. Why the obsession with jetpacks? Why the non-obsession? Everyone wants one to go to the bakery! A future without jetpacks isn't worth saving. Let's go. This isn't at all scary! - Hello. - Fuck! What's that? Why are you alone? I'm not alone, you're here. What's your name? I'm Mouse. Are you Fox's friends? Who? Weasel said not to talk to anyone except Fox's friends. Who are Weasel and Fox? Weasel looks after us. She and Fox are sweethearts. They don't show it, but I've seen them kissing. See you! The zombies are coming. Wait! Come back, you little coypu! OK, Alice... On the count of 3, we run. 1, 2... Alice, wait! Wait! Wait for me! Oh shit! They don't walk, they trot! Your plan sucks, Dad. Sorry, I did my best. Thank you. Thank Raph. I wanted to abandon you. Thanks, Raph. No, well, er... Best to avoid death. - What? - We gotta go. They're coming for us. Hold on to me. I'll teleport us to a safe place. - What's that? - You forgot to charge it. It doesn't need charging, it's solar-powered! Well, it's night-time! - Let's sacrifice Gilbert. - No, you. - I agree. - I don't want anyone to die. Fox, over here! Weasel. Come on, let's go! Follow us, you zombies! Come eat us, you losers! Let's get out of here! - Hurry! - Wait for us! Who's Fox? I'm Fox! No one ever listens! Holy cow! Matteo. Go report to Constance on our progress. And get myself killed? Hi, guys! Constance wants a progress report. Richard, you can tell her we've had a minor setback, an explosion. No, don't. Tell her we have a lead. But be vague, OK? You're on speaker. She heard everything. In your face! - Is she pissed off? - You're still on speaker! Tell her I promise we'll find them. Guys, move your asses! We need clues. Victor, put that down! The way things are going, I'll be mission leader tonight! LAIR LAIR Out the way! Welcome to the Lair. Fox! How are you? 1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3! Come on. Keep still. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, that's enough! I wanted to thank you again. No, well, er... No need. You're part of the team now. Part of what? The team. You're one of us. Well, if you want to be. You'd accept a 21st-century hipster? We already have a robot, so... You have a robot? What d'you mean, a robot? Never mind. Forget it. I didn't want them to come. They seem harmless enough. That guy though... he's a real menace. Can't you see it's clean? Are you dumb? I don't know what to do with him. You don't have to kill him. To save you, maybe. You can't save everyone. I can too. For now, we saved you. Yeah. Enjoy! Hey, elbows on the table! That's better. It's tiring, going every day. This looks tasty. What is it? R.O.U.S. R.O.U.S.? OK. What's R.O.U.S.? Forget it, I'd rather not know. Good thinking. Enjoy your meal, Gilbert. R.O.U.S. is rat, giant rat. Great! - What did I say? - Quiet. Henry? The Time Patrol is coming! Time Patrol! Freeze! Pack, into position! Do we shoot or not? Give me a rock! Pass them on! We stay here. Louise? Fire! Fuck! What now, chief? Get out of the Lair! Get lost! I don't know, they're kids! All together now! Yeah, armed kids! Fuck the Time Patrol! Little bastards. You know what? Take that, Lost Boys! No, Victor! Take cover! Henry! This is all your fault! I know. Dad! Don't... Don't do it! Don't! Stop! Pack, lay down your arms. We surrender. No. Don't be... We're not after you. All right? You're safe. It's going to be all right. I wanted to thank you. You helped us catch a notorious criminal. What's criminal about trying to prevent disasters? You think he's a hero? You're mistaken. Every "good deed" of his causes collateral damage. The madman thinks he's saving the world. Do you motivate your RoboCops with that little spiel? Well it won't work on me. You claim to protect Time. But you want everything to stay as it is. Because it suits you. Because things could be worse. - Than the end of the world? - Everything ends. Even the world. No need to time travel to save the planet. - I'll stop Dad building the plant. - You will not. Why? Are you going... To torture you? I have more persuasive means. To confront you with your contradictions. Are you me? Old? 33 isn't old. It is. It's impossible anyway. After all you've been through, you don't believe I'm the future you? What are my favorite movies? The Before Saga. It was a trilogy in your day, so forget the last one. Why are you here? Constance brought me. To tell you what I heard when I was in your place. We're not stealing Dad's computer. Why? Because it's wrong. Is that it? I'm not going to spoil your life by revealing mine. I bet you had a wild time! That's right. I've met people, I've traveled. I have a great life. And all thanks to Dad. - I can live my own life. - No, you can't. I hate to say so, I swear, but you can't. We'd be struggling without Dad, doing shitty jobs. Because to be honest, apart from moaning about the world... We're pretty useless. That's right. There's something else. He's going to get sick. - What's wrong? - You know what's wrong. He's been drinking since Mom died. He's going to need you. Until the very end. I don't believe you. You're talking crap. He'll mellow towards the end. You'll be able to talk. I can talk to him now. I'll tell him to quit. It's already too late. It's already... Tell him you love him. It might sound dumb, but it's important. Believe me. Sorry to disappoint you. I didn't say you did. But I thought that in your place. What now? You're going to bed. And Alice? She'll know what to do. Thank you for your cooperation. Sorry to look so overjoyed. Glad to be of service, Constance. Fox... your arrogance is inappropriate. - You've destroyed lives. - And saved many. I doubt it. But you don't remember. Do you know why? When we accomplish a mission and outfox you, Time starts over again. So you can't remember. Infuriating, isn't it? Do you remember? Only those who alter Time remember the other realities. That's the rule. Is it frequent? You have no idea! He's lying. He always does. To unsettle you. - And it works. - Not on me. This is the end of your criminal activities. You're finished, Fox. Today's the big day! You're signing the deal with Axomako. Yes. They're expecting us. The pressure! For your crimes, I am sentencing you to a long stay in the Hole. What's the Hole? A prison where Time does not exist. I hope you made up with Alice. - More or less. - She's a great girl. I mean that respectfully. Eyes on the road, please. It takes guts to oppose your dad. - Fabio. - Yes? - You talk too much. - Yes, sir. But you're right. It takes guts. Turn around. What? We're going home. Something's amiss. TIME CHANGE IN PROGRESS Don't you have a meeting? I'd rather be here with you. What about the plant? She wouldn't have approved. I wish you'd known her. Why didn't the doctor save Mom? He wanted to save you both. But I have you. You know... I still like Franklin the Turtle. I knew it! What's going on? I don't get it. A change is underway? It's an internal change. It's Gilbert, not us. You can't interfere. I can do whatever I like. Matteo, Louise, find Gilbert. - Don't, Constance! - Make sure he goes to his meeting. If he refuses? Threaten to kill his daughter. What? She serves no purpose. I studied her life. She lacks ambition. She cannot alter Time. Hang on, we almost killed some kids! You refuse? Very well. Victor, you're mission leader. What did I tell you? Go with Matteo. Unless he objects? No. Let's go. Mole, I asked you to solder the green wire to the red wire. Then connect the green wire to the console. Gently with my kneecap. Mole, the green wire to the red wire! Thank you, sweetie! It's just what I didn't want. - Doctor? - One second. I said the small pliers, Skunk. Mole, it's the... Can you see or not? Doctor! What? We have a problem. Stay there. Time Patrol, motherfucker! What is this? Go with Matteo. The girl stays with me. Just hold on! Let go of me! Shut it! The boss says she's hopeless and her life is too. So if she dies... no one will give a shit. Let go of me! Gilbert, do what was asked of you and things'll work out. I know you tried, Dad. That's all that matters. I'm sorry. Let's go. I don't know why I'm laughing! Don't move. You've lost, Constance. We protect the course of Time. If we lose, everyone loses. Louise, take the prisoners to the Hole. Richard... go with them and supervise. Understood. Fabio, the office. - Who's he? - Don't ask questions! Right... The procedure is this: you climb into the Hole and you won't feel a thing. Or so I've heard. Richard... there's something weird down there. What? You! If you succeed, no one will remember that, right? No one in the patrol but you. By helping us, you're involved in the time change. You don't remember because we were enemies but we've met several times. Well... nice to meet you, again. OK, what do you guys need? It'd be great if Constance thinks I put up a fight back there. Sure. A real hero who did karate! - Seriously? - No. - Run into anyone? - No. Got the gear? We found this on a criminal and took this from you. - Know how to use it? - Sure. I don't just play video games, I observe sometimes. Glad to hear it. Here's the plan. Raph, save Alice and tell her dad she's safe. I'll deal with Matteo. Louise? I'll take care of Constance. Will you be OK? Victor's dumb but dangerous. Sure, I'll sneak up on him. He won't see me... ...coming! Oh fuck! - Are you there yet? - Almost. Everything's under control. We dealt with the prisoners. Where's Richard? What was that? Oh fuck! The prisoners have escaped! Bye-bye. Raph? Raph! Don't move. Stop moving! Catch... me... if you can! Gotcha! - Is he OK? - Stay in the car. You bas... But... Where's he gone? ...tard! Matteo, good luck! Pliers, pliers, pliers! Where are you at? I usually have more time to build time-travel machines! - How can I help? - Find me an eye, arms, legs! Contactor! Doc, we have to get them out. I'm doing my best! Oh shit! Freeze! So long! We've never had a good chat. Hang on. OK, so you can hold your breath, now get out! I knew it! Surrender. You asked for this! Stop! He's unconscious. Thanks, Alice. No, well, er... I didn't do much. I didn't have a plan as such. I was in the shit! Right. You have to call your dad, now! It's too late. We've got your friend. Hurry up, they're waiting! I'm sorry. I've failed. What about the children? Can you help them? I won't do it. What? Sacrifice Dad to save the world. It isn't right. Got a plan? Yes. But you won't like it. Go on. I guess this is it, Labuse. So long, sonny. People can teach you so much. You've taught me nothing. Except friendship. And I've had so much fun. It's been great, Labuse. Don't change. Just stop killing. Come on, Thomas. Dr. Simon, Labuse, so long! I'm sorry. I didn't want to threaten the girl. She's a harmless civilian. Don't underestimate her. What the...? Here we go! Alice? I don't understand. You heard me. Save the mother, not the daughter. I can save both. No. You can't. The mother. Not the daughter. Do as she says. Alice is erasing herself from Time. We've won. You won't remember any of this. Hello. Who are you? Nobody. No! This can't be happening! I don't want to forget her! Her name's Alice. Her name's Alice. Her name's... Who's Alice? She's... Alice was your sister's name. But she was still-born. That's sad. You're here now. That's what counts. Why's Dad pulling a weird face? I was supposed to sign something. I don't remember what. Alzheimer's strikes! You signed the deal yesterday, look. You're on vacation now. Alibert launches experimental renewable energy project I remember now. Fantastic! You're wonderful. You're so beautiful. I love you. Me too. Are you OK? I love your hair that way. You smell good, honey. You OK? Back to normal? Yes. - It's always a bit painful. - Only natural. Your brain is rearranging the layers of reality. It'll end up as mush. How is everyone? And the cloud? As if it never existed. - And the kids? - As grubby as ever! You lost! Good. We did it. A patrol member helped us for once. Unlike her buddies, our ally remembers everything. We've turned an agent. Louise. Constance. And if we can turn one... the opportunities are endless. Time travel has no rules? We can do whatever we like. No. You don't get it, eh? Alice created a totally unprecedented time paradox. It was risky and could have had dramatic consequences. - OK. - Got that? No. What matters is that she succeeded. And she's been waiting for her drink! A born complainer! Fifteen minutes or a century, time's always relative. - Right? - Nope, Raph. Thanks for having me on the team. Why am I still here though? You canceled your birth. Dying, however, would have undone your act in that version of reality. Got that? You exist without having existed. You're one of reality's drifters. I feel I exist though. We'll discuss that after a few pints. Let's drink!
