Woman: So what do you say, vince? Not bad, huh? Not bad? It stinks. The next one we do has got to have more punch. Is that why the record company sent us back here to shoot it? To give you some hometown inspiration? Sure. Once we get there we can take it, experiment, play around till we come up with something original. What's going on back there? Very funny. Very funny. (chattering) How many years is it since you last went back home, vince? Nearly 20. Old joss is the only one left now. He's the caretaker. He's been alone in the house all these years. Joss... I can hardly remember his face. He was already old when I left. We kids used to rib him about the way he shook all the time. We were always asking him to make us malts. (chuckles) (rustling) (rustling) (rustling continues) (loud banging) (distant dogs barking) (dogs continue barking) (dogs snarling, barking) - Lousy weather. - (animals howling) It sure is. Goddamn fog. Oh, jeez, another roadblock. We only just left one. Looks like all the cops in this county are out tonight. They're making a whole big deal about those mad dogs. The camper's mine. It's registered. I used to live up here. We're coming to shoot a rock video. Man: Vince roberts. Ain't you lou and martha roberts's boy? Well, I'll be. Vince raven... The guy who sings "my mother's gone"? Uh-huh. Holy shit. Imagine meeting you. I can't tell one of these newfangled songs from another, but if you really are lou and martha's boy, you sure as hell should remember me. Sheriff morrison. Yeah, I remember. I used to sit on your lap and piss all over your pants, right? That's right, boy. You was more full of water than hoover dam. And now he's a rock singer, huh? Just sounds like a big pisser to me. Flesh and blood, as I live and breathe. It's been a long time since I last saw you, boy. Since your father had... Oh, yes, I remember. Well, if it's okay with you, guys, we'd like to go now. Marilou: The caretaker's waiting up for us and it's really getting cold out here. Okay, but you know about the dogs, don't you? Yeah, we'll watch out. There already have been five deaths in the area. Angela: Five? At the other roadblocks they only mentioned two deaths. Well, now there's three more to chalk up to the damn dogs. The samples family... Bill, Jennifer and peter samples... Butchered like hogs. It was difficult to tell which bit came from where, just like last time. Why, what was left you could put in a plastic bag this big. (angela exclaims) Okay, kids, you can go now, but be careful. Vince knows what these dogs can do. Barricade yourselves in when you get to the house. Back the car up. You sure picked a fine time to come back home, vince. Folks around here ain't forgot that story about your daddy, you know. Well, take care, boy. Make sure there are weapons in the house and don't let nobody in. (windshield wipers whirring) Slow down, vince. I'm crawling as it is. Vince, what was all that about your father? Okay. If you don't want to talk about it, it's all the same to me. I'd rather not talk about it. - I thought... - I said I don't want to talk about it. All right. All right. I'm sorry. Vince, how are you going to find the way to the house? - With my nose. - (laughs) What are you laughing about? I'm not kidding. When I was a kid I could find my way home - just by the smell. - What smell? The bullshit. It's unmistakable. (distant dogs howling) (rustling) Hey. What's gotten into you? I saw something move over there. I don't see nothing. Maybe it was one of them things, one of them dogs. Well, I guess we'd better go take a look. What do we do if they attack? (cocks guns) bleed, I guess. (chuckles) ♪ Whoopee-ti-yi-yo ♪ come along, little doggie... ♪ - Sheriff. - I'm right here, dan. Got a pack of doggy cookies with you? Might come in handy. Come on out. Show yourselves, you damn dogs. I'll pop lead into every last one of you. Yes, sirree. (distant dogs howling) Hey, sheriff. Sheriff, where are you? Sheriff, answer me. Don't get too far away. (dog snarling) (whimpers) Sheriff, for christ sakes, answer me. Sheriff? (whimpering) (exclaims) - (snarling) - (screams) - Vince, look out! - (dog whimpering) God. Easy, vince. It wasn't your fault. Oh, that poor dog. What if we killed it? Jordan, frank, I found it. (owl hooting) He's alive, but not for long. Marilou: At this rate, we may not be either. Those dogs could be everywhere. She's right. Let's beat it. In a second. Jordan, switch on the emergency lights before someone rams the camper. And frank, let's move the dog over to the side of the road. Okay. (dog whimpering) - Angela: Vince, don't. - Marilou: He has to. (whimpering) Come on, let's get back to the camper. - (screams) - vince: Who are you? Now you've done it. Can you feel the wind? The wind is lifting the fog and blowing away the clouds that cover the moon. Now he's back at last. He will command the house. And all of you... All of you will die. - It was an accident. - All of you will die. Can't you see he's crazy? Make him go away! You are already dead. All of you are already dead. His dogs will not spare you. He'll find you wherever you go. And when the moon shines again, you will all die. Wait. Let's get you to a hospital. Hold it, vince. If there's something out there, we'd better all stick together. Marilou: He was covered with blood. He needs help. - (dog snarling) - my god, what's that? The dogs must have attacked him. Let's go away, please. Let's get back into the camper before it's too late. Yeah, vince, let's get out of here. I'm going. I can't just drive off and leave him. Marilou: Okay, so I'll drive. Frank: Hey, wait a minute, vince. You're crazy to go out there on your own. You're all chicken. Wait, vince. I'm coming with you. Here, put this on. Vince, we've got to find him. Sure we do. He'd be great for our video. I don't think that's at all funny. Lighten up. What's eating you? I don't know, but I have a feeling, something would like to. Vince, what's that? - (snarling) - (screams) Vince: In the camper, quick, everyone. (engine starts) Come on, vince. I want to know what went on in the woods. Nothing, man. I didn't touch her. - What about the old man? - Didn't touch him either. (groans) Joss. I haven't had a welcome like this since I came back from camp. And they used the same banner then. Jordan: They don't throw their money around, these country folk. - Marilou: Local boy comes home a star. - Angela: "welcome, vincent"... - How about that? - Vince: Hey, joss, we're here. (door opens) Joss. Hey, joss, where are you? Frank: The welcome seemed warmer out there - than it does in here. - Marilou: You can say that again. Joss? Quit hiding out on me, will you? I wonder where the old guy's got to. Let's try the kitchen. Sandra, come on. Frank: How are we supposed to shoot a video in here? There's not enough light to take a pee. Jordan: Vince said we needed something new. - How about 10 minutes of total black? - Marilou: Revolutionary. He's got to be here somewhere. Joss. Hey, joss. Frank: Well, at least he put in some good work before he disappeared. Marilou: Mm, right on. You guys wait here, okay? Okay. - I'll just be a minute. - Frank: Sure thing. - Jordan, want a beer? - Sure. Thanks. (rhythmic squeaking) (squeaking continues) (squeaking continues) (squeaking stops) - Wowee. - Marilou: What have you found? Another tray. Good old joss. Mm, I'm starving. - Leave a few for vince. - He's too busy looking for joss. Marilou: These look even better than the others. (creaking) (dog howling) Angela, why don't you eat something? I'm not hungry. You don't know what you're missing. Angela: We're not safe here. I've got a strange feeling about it. Angela, for god's sake. There are some things I feel. I sense them. We're in danger here. The old man was right. We should never have come. Horrible things are going to happen here. Can you feel the wind? The wind is lifting the fog. He will command the house and all of you will die. You are all going to die. You are all dead. They have come for you. They're his. (panting) (laughing) (screaming) (screams) - (whimpering) - (man laughing) Go away! No, leave me alone! You're horrible! I warned you. You should never have come to this house. You will all die. You're going to die too. (laughing) It's no use trying to resist. You are all doomed. (laughing) (screaming) Help me. Old man: Your singer... He is the killer. You will see. Only he will escape the dogs. (laughing) If you come out now, perhaps he will spare you because you're so young and pretty. (laughing) You're trying to trick me, old man. I know you're lying. Vince is our friend. I know he is. He's our friend. And now it's you that's gonna die. Vince. Can you hear me? Vince. Watch out for the old man. He's trying to kill us, but we'll kill him first. We'll kill him before he gets the chance. Right, vince? Vince, where are you? - (laughing) - (whimpering) So you think I'm lying, do you? You'll soon find out who your singer is. (both screaming) Vince! I knew you were still alive. (chair squeaking) Do you hear me? Hey, vince, it's me, angela. - (snarling) - no! No! I don't want to die! - Leave me alone! - Angela, what are you talking about? It's okay. Wake up. - Go away! - What's going on? What happened? Wake up, angela. - What the hell's going on? - What's the problem? It's all over, honey. It's all over. You're all right now. - What's wrong with her? - She's had a nightmare. It was a signal. You changed into a... And you killed everybody... Everybody except me. I call that discrimination. - Right on. - Yeah. Vince, you can't play favors with friends. Either you wipe out everybody or no one. (laughing) But then he almost killed me. There was the old man too, the one we met on the road. Before, you said I'd changed into something. What was it? You changed into a... a werewolf. Can you see vince transformed into a werewolf? Just think of vince covered with hair, howling at the moon. (howling) (distant howling) (rocking chair squeaking) She's sleeping now. And the others have gone back to bed too. (sighs) only now I can't get back to sleep. Neither can you, from what I see. What are you reading? Oh, vince, you're not letting angela get to you? Forget her nightmares. We're grown-up people, vince, rational and... That thing we saw in the woods wasn't normal or rational. "Werewolves: Myths, legends and scientific realities." Just what exactly are the scientific realities? There's a disease... A heart disease that transforms the patient into some kind of madman, a beast that goes howling at the moon like a wolf. What? That's crazy. That thing we saw out there was an animal of some kind, not a man. Listen, werewolves do exist. Oh, bullshit, vince. The year 2000 is just around the corner. I am a recognized expert in electronic videos. And you are the hottest rock 'n' roll star in the world. You're making records, videos, movies on high-tech electronic equipment of fantastic sophistication. You can get on a plane tonight and be in australia tomorrow. And you're scared of werewolves? 20 years ago something terrible happened here. And it's happening again. Entire families were wiped out by a pack of killer dogs. They weren't normal dogs. These dogs were more unpredictable and more intelligent. The people went crazy. They needed a scapegoat so they accused my father. Oh... your father? Yes, my father. He was afflicted with that disease I was telling you about. Sometimes when the moon was full he'd leave the house and go wandering through the fields like an animal. One time my mother found him underneath a bush. His hands and his mouth were covered with blood and next to him on the ground were the remains of a baby calf. He'd ripped the guts out and eaten them. - Oh my god. - The neighbors were convinced that he was the cause of all the atrocities. They came to the house and dragged him out. My mother and I tried to stop them, but it was useless. They slaughtered him. They stabbed him to death with pitchforks. They doused him with gasoline and set him on fire. Oh, vince, forgive me. How was I to know? But you must try to understand that this has nothing to do with werewolves, just a pack of ordinary stray dogs. And that creature we saw out there? That was a dog too. He was a bit bigger than normal, that's all. Maybe he was sick. After all, we only saw it for a second. You sure are something, you know that, sandra? Do you know something, vince? As soon as we deliver this video job, we're heading straight for moorea... One of the 130 polynesian islands... Floating in crystal clear water, two weeks of nude sunbathing coconut drinks and making love. I love you, vince. I can't stand seeing you like this. You go to bed now. I'll be up in a minute. Okay. Don't be long. I won't. (distant howling) Oh, no.

(screaming) look out. Give me a hand. Turn him over. Oh, god, it's joss. Frank: Joss? Why would anyone want to kill an old caretaker? I don't know. Take it easy, angela. Take it easy. Sandra: Come on, up you get. Here, let me give you a hand. Sandra: It's okay. You'll be all right now. Marilou: Here, blow your nose. Sandra: That's the way. Come and lie down. Angela: No, I don't want to lie down! I want to get away from this house. I told you we should never have come here. Angie, you've got to calm down. Okay, guys, I want to check out what went on up there. Does anyone want to come along? Looks like there's been one hell of a struggle here. Hey, guys, maybe whoever it was dropped this before. What do you think? I don't get it. Why would anyone want to kill joss? But if the dogs did it, they could still be in the house. Marilou: Hey, guys, where is angela? She must still be in the living room. Come on, we mustn't leave her alone. Thank god you've got guns in this house. Looks like we may need them. We've looked everywhere. She's not in the house. I'm going outside to look for her. You stay here - and barricade yourselves in. - Frank: What if you don't find her? Vince: If I'm not back by sundown, leave without me. - Frank: Are you crazy? - No, I mean it. Are we all agreed then? Well, only if you swear not to take any risks, okay? Sure. And don't open up to anybody. I'm going to call the police. I'll go with you. The line's dead. This is all getting like a nightmare, marilou. Yeah, just like angela's nightmare, right? That's done. Ed's finished his little job. This here is a bullet that will pierce vince roberts's heart. Hey, we've got company. Marilou: Was vince expecting anyone? Sandra: Not that he told me. Here, take this. Marilou: Keep your guns up. (laughing) Howdy, folks. Is vince roberts with you all? No, but he should be back soon. We're after them damn dogs. We ain't seen no sign of them around here. How about you? Not yet. But if they do show up, we're ready for them. (laughing) good, sonny. That sure is good to know. Angela. Angela. Angela! You know, I'm sort of like family to vince. We knew his daddy real well. I can't wait to see him again. If you invite me in, maybe we can wait for him together... real friendly-like, over a couple of beers. What do you say? Shall we let them in? Vince said we shouldn't open up to anybody. But these people are in the same boat as us. And it seems to me the more guns we have around the better. Well, I don't like the looks of them. Oh, come on now. Don't you try and tell me you ain't got no beer in the fridge. That wouldn't be friendly. Sandra: Well, I guess since they said they knew vince's daddy... okay, come on in. That's more like it. Do you hear that, guys? What do you say we accept these people's kind hospitality? Ed, you stay out here just in case anything unpleasant comes around, know what I mean? Vince: Angela! Hey, ed, take care of the camper. (chuckles) (humming a tune) (gunshot) (screams) Sandra: Stay where you are. Who's this? Joss, the caretaker. What do you know? His heart's been torn clear out. Another victim of your boyfriend? What the hell are you talking about? I think you know, missy. And if you don't, you'll soon find out when vince roberts gets back. What are you going to do with him? What I'm going to do with him, I'm going to shoot this here silver bullet right through his heart. But why would anyone want to kill vince? I think I understand. You are the same band that killed vince's father, aren't you? We made a mistake back then. We should have known that his son was cursed by the evil too. We should have killed him off then. You're just a bunch of stupid animals. What the hell do you think that killing vince is going to solve? Don't you understand that werewolves are just an idiotic superstition? Listen, I was here that night when we killed roberts and I'm telling you, he wasn't a man anymore. You understand me, girl? He was something horrible. It was a night like this, a night when there was a full moon. It is then that they transform themselves. When vince gets back, I'm going to shoot him right through the heart with this silver bullet. That's how you kill werewolves. But they're mad, completely mad. And the dogs... have you seen the dogs too? It's him who commands them, controls them. Those are the powers of werewolves. If you try to kill him, we'll turn you in. We'll go to the sheriff. The sheriff's dead, and so is the deputy... Torn to pieces by the dogs. Ed and me seen vince roberts while he turned from a man to a monster. What monster? What's he talking about? Sandra: I saw it too. - What? What did you see? - The monster, the thing you call the werewolf. When? Last night, when I was with vince. So it can't possibly be him. Did you see it too? (laughs) Well, I guess you must be the werewolf's sweetheart. Ain't that right? - Angela. - Vince. Come on, let's get back to the house. - I have this vision... - forget the vision. Let's get out of here. He's coming. It's vince roberts with a girl. Jerome, greg, watch these kids. If they move so much as a hair, shoot. Ed, you be ready to open the door when I tell you. Right. (door closes) Frank, sandra, open the door. Come on, quick. Whose car is that? Are you guys all right? Answer me, someone. Jordan, frank, come on. Wait here a minute. Now! The bastard's escaping. He's getting away. Jerome, greg, after him. Kill them. Okay, boys, I'm coming. - Let's get her onto the couch. - Right. (crying) He's going up on the roof. Up, both of you. I don't like you. Well, you're not exactly my type either. You look like a couple of queers to me. Queers make my stomach turn! Move. Go on. Do you know I got to kill you? You're not serious. Say goodbye to your boyfriend. (all yelling) (screaming) - Vince roberts! - Don't shoot! (snarling, barking) I'm going to treat this bastard like he wanted to treat you. - Well? - No, sandra. We're not murderers. Listen, sandra, think of vince. We've got to help him. Okay. I'm going out to find vince. Okay, but be careful. - (all shouting) - shut the door! Frank! Hey, you! All right, vince roberts. (barking) (screaming) Marilou: Shoot them! Shoot them! I can't. I'd kill him. Marilou: No! Frank! Frank! Fight them off so I can shoot. Frank, fight them off. I can't. He may be hurt. - Marilou: They've quieted down. - Yeah. - Why? - I don't know. Something is trying to get in! That's not a dog trying to get in. I can't hold it back. Your jacket. - Don't jordan, don't. - Let me go. Come on, let's go. (dogs barking) Sandra, my hair, my hair! He's pulling my hair. My hair. Help me, sandra. Help me. (crying) - (snarls) - (screaming) Okay, where is it? I'll kill it! Vince. Oh, vince, where have you been? Come on, marilou, let's go. That's good. It's all over. It's all over. We are going to die too. We haven't got a chance. It's all over. Calm down, marilou. You'll see, everything will be all right. It's him. He is to blame for what has happened to angela, frank and jordan. What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy? Where was he when that monster dog crashed through the living room door and when jordan was eaten alive? And before that, in the bathroom? And now? Why don't the dogs attack us? Tell me the truth, vince. Your neighbors were right. You are the monster dog. You are the murdering animal. God damn you! Damn you! You are a werewolf. I know you are. I know it! (sobbing) What can we do, vince? (whimpering, panting) (breathing heavily) Vince. It's amazing, isn't it? They suddenly all calm down, just like that. But how? Why? Go wake up marilou. Make it quick. Okay. - Shit. - What's happened? The keys aren't here. I guess one of those four had them on him. - I'm gonna have to go back. - I'll come with you. Are you going to leave me here alone? You'll be safe enough locked in here. But what if you don't come back? Well, you'd better pray that we do. He doesn't have them. - Check that one. - Okay. Vince, I found them! Here, catch. Vince! Vince! I'll catch you yet, vince roberts. Sandra, grab the gun! Help! Help! (screams) Oh, vince, vince. It's not over. We've still got to get out of here. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, hurry up. (sighs) I can hardly believe that this nightmare is finally over. What do you say, marilou? Marilou? You haven't fallen asleep, have you? Marilou? (screams) - (snarling) - (screaming) Open the door. Sandra, open the door. - Jump! - No. Jump! Jump! (moaning) (gunshot) Vince? (moaning) (distant howling) (howling) (exclaims) I tell you now, he's taken my place and his blood is as tainted as mine. Vince was just a baby. Horrible things happened. His father sank his teeth into my neck. And now vince has come back to help me. Now, for better or worse, we have a new king who will live in the house of the dead forever. (groans) Vince. Vince! - Vince. - Stay away from me! Why? Stay away from me! (gasps) Use it. Shoot me. Do it before it's too late. Come on, shoot me. Come on. (moaning) (growling) God help me. (panting) You were right, angela. You weren't crazy. You knew. You knew all along.
