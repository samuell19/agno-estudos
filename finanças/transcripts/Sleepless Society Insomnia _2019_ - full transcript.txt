MORNING NEWS CHANNEL ONE To all our viewers, there's some big news this morning about Miss Iya Iyana. Last night, she posted a set of photos on her personal social media platform with a message written about a scandal in an orphanage on Kra Ya Ngan Island that happened 40 years ago. While these pictures have been shared widely and quickly, our Channel One news team has attempted to contact the foundation which founded the orphanage to comment, but, so far, the foundation, through a representative, has denied to provide any information. However, the foundation would like to ask that everyone shop sharing or publishing these photos, as they fear that the lives of the people in the photos will be affected, because many of them are still living on the island. As for Iya, who released these pictures, our team has also attempted to make contact with her to find out her reason for releasing the pictures, as well as her relation to the people on the island, but, so far, we haven't been able to reach her. However, our news team will continue to try to make contact with her, as this seems to be the hot topic that everyone is interested in and we are all waiting to hear an explanation from her. You guys don't think I posted those pictures, right? I've never even seen these pictures until now. What about the flash drive? It was password-protected. You all saw that last night. Hey. You guys don't really think I posted those pictures, right? I didn't even know the flash drive could be opened. But you had it with you the entire time, didn't you? And last night, you were the last person to go to bed. But I really didn't post those pictures. Why would I do that? Faye! I'm coming. Come on, honey. Let's go home. Let's go. Mom, what's going on? Haven't you seen the news? Your friend has caused more trouble. Always a troublemaker. Let's just go home. Don't stay here any longer. Other people will hate us too. Come on. Iya, I have to go too. My mom just called. I'll go get my things. Iya, let's go inside. I knew that girl would make trouble for everyone on the island. That's why your dad told me to keep an eye on you. If only I had listened to him, I would have never let you go near her. Mom, Dad used to live in the orphanage, right? Yes, why? I saw those pictures. There's a kid that looks like Dad when he was a kid. Was Dad one of the kids who got... Is it him? I think it is. I've seen a picture of Sen. Sgt. Maj. Ram as a kid. He looked like that. What are you looking at? Nothing. Don't you have anything better to do? Why don't you go arrest the person who released these photos? I've already sent someone to bring her in for questioning. -You got these pictures too? -Everyone got them. Everyone's sharing them. Didn't you get them? I did, but I deleted them. I have no reason to keep them. That foreigner in the photo was a perverted sicko. It's good that he's dead. Oh, he's dead? He was killed a long time ago. Sen. Sgt. Maj. Ram and his people were the suspects in the case, but they were cleared. If it really was him in the picture, I wouldn't be surprised if he did it. Suea. You've heard the news, right? I can assure you, Suea, that I didn't release those photos. I had no reason to do that. You know that, right? It doesn't matter who released them. What matters is, I told you, but you didn't listen to me. I'm sorry. If I had known that what was on the flash drive was those pictures, -I wouldn't have taken it. -Right. So it's my fault? That I didn't tell you what was in there was a picture of my dad getting... getting disgusting things done to him? -That's not what I mean. -But you don't have to apologize to me, -because this affects you too. -What? Your dad was in the pictures too. Don't tell me you haven't seen that. Well, I... Whatever. I don't want to hear it anymore. You can save your breath and go talk to the police. You should just go back to your old life. And stop digging into things that will hurt the people on the island. You really didn't do it, did you? Do you see any reason why I would do that? I'm not getting anything out of this. It's only making a bigger mess. That's true. There it is, the mess is at your front door. Miss Iya, we're bringing you in for questioning at the station. Okay. You're still going to work today? Why would you ask me that? Well, with everything that happened, I just thought... What happened? I have no idea. I'm going. Do you understand now why I didn't want you getting involved with that girl? I hope that she'll stop. That she'll stop right here. Otherwise, things are only going to get worse. Are there worse things than this, Mom? I had no reason to do it. Officer, please think about it. If I really did it, would I be dumb enough to use my own Facebook account? That's right. Maybe someone hacked into her account. But we checked the IP address. It was the IP address from your laptop. Also, we found the flash drive with the pictures with you. How do you explain that? Today, you were brought in for questioning and to hear the charge against you. But I would like to ask you something as a resident on Kra Ya Ngan Island. Do you realize how much your actions are putting everyone here in jeopardy? You know who's affected by the release of the photos? It's not the foreigner, because he's dead. It's those orphans in the pictures. Many of those men still live here. They've been trying to forget the past and move on with their lives. But the pictures you released are making them relive their painful memories. Do you think they can go back to having a normal life after this? But, again, I can assure you that I really didn't post those pictures. The police called and said you guys were here. So Dad told me to come get you. Why did you pull over? I saw Dr. Sakka's car parked there. I'm going to go and check. Dr. Sakka? Hello, Win? What? Dad killed himself, Mom. Mom! Suea... Iya, what are you doing here? I wanted to come and pay my respects. That's not a good idea. You should go. Oh, my! How dare she! I really want to pay my respects. Mom! -Why are you here? -Don't! -Iya! -Why are you here? Mom, stop! -Get out! -Calm down, Mom. Get her out of here! Iya, just go. Get out! -Go. -Come on. Let's go home, Iya. Come on, let's go. It's okay. I can go home by myself. You went to the temple, didn't you? That's why you came back in that condition. When are you going to stop trying to be nice to them? They want nothing to do with us. There's no "us." You sneaked into my house last night and used my laptop to post those pictures, didn't you? You know how crazy you sound right now? How could I go on your Facebook? I don't even know your password. None of your friends saw me either. Iya, come home with your aunt. There's nothing for you here. You're not my aunt. You have nothing left but me! Maybe it's better to have a fake aunt than to have nothing! You understand, Iya? Hi, how are you doing? Well, pretty bad. And you? How are you? They don't know yet that we're on the same side? Everything seems normal. But let's not talk about me. Let's talk about you. I just went through the file on the murder of the foreigner who was at the orphanage 20 years ago. There's something suspicious about it -because... -Just stop. Isn't it clear enough that we should stop right now? None of this has anything to do with my mother at all. Everything I've learned since I got here, is to hurt other people. If I had listened to you and left right from the start, it wouldn't have turned out like this. Don't lose hope. We've made it pretty far. Maybe it's too far. I think we should turn back right now before it's too late. Tomorrow when the ferry leaves, I'm going back to Bangkok. You should leave too. Request a transfer as soon as possible. When will you let me deal with the lieutenant? He's been snooping around too much. Make your decision quickly. If he finds anything, we'll be in serious shit. -Where's your mom? -She's saying goodbye to Dr. Su. I'll go wait in the car. You were in those pictures, right? Is that why you did that to me? So what? Would that make you understand and pity me and forgive me for the sick shit I did to you? No. I'll never forgive you. It would make me hate you even more. You went through that horrible thing. You knew how terrible it was. But instead of letting it stop at you, you chose to pass it on. It's not the disease that's disgusting, it's the carrier of the disease. If you think I'm so disgusting, then you had better kill me. But be sure to plan it carefully. Don't make mistakes like your friend did. What mistake? Who made a mistake? Thank you. Suea, I'll be going now, okay? Thank you so much, Mo. Suea, don't be angry at Iya. I don't think she released those photos. I don't think she's the kind of person who would do such a thing. But sometimes, people do unexpected things, Mo. Look at my dad. Who would've thought he would kill himself? Ms. Toon, too. No one would've thought she wanted Iya's dad so much that she would use those pictures as leverage. She wanted Iya's dad? Yes. Mr. Wisanu told me about it. He said that Iya's dad and Ms. Toon had an affair like people said. And she found the pictures that Iya's dad had kept. That was why he left his kid and his wife for her. You knew the moment you read Ms. Toon's diary that your dad was sleeping with her, didn't you? I'm not sure... What if you were sure? It might have nothing to do with it. It doesn't prove anything. Yes, it does. Why would Mr. Wisanu say that? What do you mean, Mo? The truth is, the teacher didn't have an affair with Iya's dad. -She had an affair with... -Mo? You're here. We're leaving. I'm going to sleep at Iya's house. Why would you do that? I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, let's go. Win's mom is waiting. Okay, Suea, we'll be going then. Goodbye. Come on, Mo. Come on. Win's mom is waiting. Be careful. -What? -I want to ask you about something. You really didn't release those pictures, right? Are you crazy? Why would I do that? Well, I went to the station with Iya today. The police said the IP address was from Iya's laptop. And there were only the four of us last night. Iya said she didn't do it. I know I didn't do it. And you said you didn't do it. So who did? -Yok? -That's crazy! -It can't be Yok! -I think so too. But no one could have sneaked in. I think it's really strange. Okay. I won't bother you. MANAGEMENT TEAM GROUP CHAT Why are there no messages? -Hello? What's up, Suea? -Is Mo there with you? Can I talk to her? You want to talk to Mo? About what? I want to buy something from abroad. I want to ask her some questions about it. Just a sec. Suea wants to talk to you. Hello, Suea? I want to hear the rest of what you told me about. Can I borrow your phone? I just heard from Tle that you're coming back to Bangkok tomorrow. Yes. There's nothing left for me to do here. If you saw the news this morning, then you know. What about your mom? You're going to leave everything unfinished? Nothing good will come out of me staying here anyway. And you've seen it now, what Ms. Toon was hiding. It had nothing to do with my mom. If you mean those pictures, I think they were used to throw you off. Because what my sister was hiding was definitely not those sick pictures. There's got to be something more. Why are you so sure? You say it like you knew what Ms. Toon was hiding. I'm just thinking about it analytically. Think about it. If it was those pictures she was hiding, why would your mother ask you to look for them? I don't know what to do next anyway. So what? So you're choosing to give up and go back to your fake aunt? I don't need to go back to Bangkok for that. -She already followed me here. -What? Are you telling me that fraud followed you all the way there? That's right. That's all for now. I'm going to bed. I heard you're leaving? Mom? No. It's a dream, not reality. A dream or reality? I think you're too obsessed with that question. Paying attention to every little detail of what's in front of you, that's what matters. 64GB Did a 64GB flash drive even exist seven years ago? HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL, MOM. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Excuse me, I'll be going then. -Yes. What was the police officer doing here so early, Mom? He brought us back your dad's things that the police had kept as evidence. -So did they find anything unusual? -What could they have found? It's so obvious your dad killed himself because of that crazy girl. MANAGEMENT TEAM GROUP CHAT What? It was Win's dad who had an affair with Ms. Toon? That's right. I heard Iya tell Win that. And Win didn't deny it. So why did Win's dad pin the blame on Iya's dad? Maybe he was afraid it would link back to him. MO Hello, Mo. Are you free? I want to talk to you about something. TRANSLATION PREFACE Miss? Don't you have any other editions of this book? No. We only have this one. -You really don't have any others? -No, we don't. And this one is the latest edition. The older editions were probably thrown away, because this place was renovated, so they used that opportunity to throw away all the damaged books. -They were thrown away? -Yes. They were donated to the temple. If they haven't been sold as garbage, then they must be sitting in the temple's library. Thank you! KRA YA NGAN ISLAND COMMUNITY LIBRARY FAMOUS DESIGNER "TIPPY" TIPARPA EXPOSED Have you seen it? It's not published yet though. What do you want? And what have you done? I know how you're involved in all of this. You've been trying to get Iya to leave the island, haven't you? I'm going to give you some time to fix what you've done. But if Iya gets off the island, your story will go online. -Maew, put these in the same place. -Sure. We'll have to hurry to the market. -Hi, Principal. -Hi. You're here so early. I wanted to come by and donate these magazines. They just sit there at my house. Maybe here, some kids will read them. Thank you so much, Principal. But, actually, hardly anyone comes in here anymore. Only one person has been here recently, that model girl from the news. Iya? That's right. Win? So your friend is still going to stay here after everything? Maew. I'm just curious, Principal. -You mean Iya? -Of course! I thought after the storm passed, she would hurry and leave the island. But it turns out, she's still in the mood to go find a book to read. What's the name of the book? The... -The Grapes of Wrath. -That's right! It's a good book. That's what I thought. Iya couldn't find it at the library, so she went on to the temple. I guess she must want to read it so badly. Didn't you say it was the best plan? What are you talking about? It's Iya. She's still on the island. And she's also looking for the book. I'll deal with it. But you have to help me first. That reporter is threatening to expose me. This again? All right then, you do your job. As for the reporter, I'll deal with it. Okay. Who were you talking to? Why do you seem to have a problem with Iya being here on the island? It's grown-ups' business! You seem to have a lot of secrets lately. About this, as well as about Ms. Toon. I know that the person who was having an affair with Ms. Toon was you. Why would you lead others to believe that it was Iya's dad? I'm going to say this one more time, it's grown-ups' business! If I don't know what's going on, how can I help you? If you really want to help me, then do nothing! Trust me, Win. I'm going to do what's best for everyone. Suea. I brought Faye. I hope it's okay. What's going on, Suea? It's my dad's cell phone. I checked the group chat and the chats between him, Win's dad, and Faye's dad. But there were no messages. It's the same with my dad's phone. There were no messages on his phone either. But it doesn't mean they've never talked, right? No, something's up. My dad said something strange the other day. He said, "Don't make mistakes like your friend did." Iya. Iya. I went to the library this morning. She said that you went by earlier and that you must've gone to the temple. So I'm here to check on you. What are you looking for? I'm looking for a book. What book? The same book I was looking for. The one I got wasn't the right one. It's good that you're here. Can you help me find it? Sure. Iya! Iya! -Iya! -She's not here? Maybe she went back to Bangkok? I don't know. -Hello? What's up, Win? -Faye, hasn't Iya gone back to Bangkok? Why is she still looking for the same book? The same book? Yok? -Did you find it? -Well... I just found it. I don't know if it's the right one. I found it! 1GB This is it, Yok! Thank you so much, Yok! We meet again. Thank you for bringing her here. Iya, I'm so sorry. He won't do anything to you. He just wants the flash drive. Iya, just give it to him, and it'll all be over! Iya! Subtitle translation by Supawadee Sriputorn
