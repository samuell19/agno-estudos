NOT TWO MEN OR THREE MEN OR FOUR MEN. ...THE NEXT GENERATION GROWING UP WILL NO LONGER UNDERSTAND WHAT MARRIAGE IS. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS BEING USED BY THE HOMOSEXUAL EXTREMISTS TO DIVIDE AMERICA. THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE IS ABOUT LOVE, COMMITMENT AND MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY.

( scattered talking ) OUR NATION MUST DEFEND THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE. ( woman ) HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SAME-SEX MARRIAGES ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN &quot;SAME-SEX,&quot; LIKE MAN AND WOMAN OR-- TWO WOMEN GETTING MARRIED, OR TWO MEN GETTING MARRIED, WANTING TO SHARE THEIR LIFE TOGETHER. UH, NO PROBLEM. I REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. Y'KNOW, IF THEY LOVE EACH OTHER, THAT'S THE MAIN THING. THAT'S THE MAIN ISSUE IF-- AND THAT THEY WILL RESPECT EACH OTHER. SAME SEX ? IT'S UP TO THE PERSON. ( woman ) LIKE IF TWO WOMEN WANNA GET MARRIED. TWO WOMEN ? IT'S UP TO THE PERSON, I THINK. OR TWO MEN. BUT, IT'S LIKE, NO WAY. TWO MEN ? PERSONALLY, I WOULDN'T DO IT BUT IT'S UP TO THE PERSON. IF THE PERSON FEELS THAT THEY COULD FEEL, YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY REALLY LOVE THIS PERSON, THEY WANNA SETTLE DOWN WITH THIS PERSON, THEN IT'S UP TO THEM. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE, I CAN'T STAND IT. I HAVE BEEN SO NERVOUS. HONEY, I LOVE YOU ! IT WON'T BE LONG, YOU'LL BE SO LUCKY. LOIS, YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE THIS TO HER. I STARTED AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN 1985, AND WHEN I FIRST MET HER I WAS A &quot;ROOKIE,&quot; AS THEY CALL THEM, AND GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM, AND SHE'D HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS ON AND WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST FEMALES THAT WAS EMPLOYED BY THE TAMPA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE DID A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER. SPORTING EVENTS, SPRING TRAINING TAKING TRIPS TO GO WATCH BASEBALL GAMES. I MEAN, THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH EXCITEMENT, SO MUCH IN COMMON, IT WAS LIKE WE COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER. WHERE'S MY BABY ? GOOD-BYE, HONEY, I LOVE YOU. ( woman ) IF YOU GUYS KNEW HOW CLOSE YOU WERE RIGHT NOW. ( giggling ) LOIS AND I BOTH WENT TO M.C.C. IN ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA, AND THEY SAID &quot;WELL, YOU NEED TO GO TO CLASSES, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING.&quot; THEY SAID, &quot;YOU KNOW, SET THE DATE, LET US KNOW AND YOU'RE READY TO GO FORWARD&quot; AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. WE WENT OUT, WE HAD DINNER. WHEN THAT WAS THROUGH, THEY DROVE OFF WITH HER. AND I GO HOME AND I'M LIKE, &quot;WOW.&quot; I WAS LOST ! I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WITH SOMEBODY 24 HOURS A DAY, YOU GO TO WORK, THEY'RE AT WORK, YOU CAN TALK TO 'EM, AND I GO HOME AND SHE'S NOT THERE. ♪ CHERISH THE LOVE... ♪ I WAS NERVOUS, BUT I WAS SO HAPPY. I WANTED TO-- I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID &quot;GOD, I AM SO LUCKY.&quot; IT WAS COMING FROM THE HEART, IT WAS COMING FROM HER HEART, THE SMILE ON HER FACE. I'M GONNA TELL YOU, THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE. ( newscaster ) THE FUTURE OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGES IN MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT. FOR 32 YEARS, I'VE LOVED GLORIA AND WANTED TO MARRY HER AND I THINK THAT AFTER TODAY, I WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT. LINDA DAVIES AND GLORIA BAILEY HAD THEIR DAY IN COURT TODAY, ONE OF SEVEN GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES WHO WENT BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT TO ARGUE FOR THE RIGHT TO MARRY IN MASSACHUSETTS. BUT THE STATE IS SAYING HILLARY MAY NOT MARRY JULIE GOODRIDGE... ATTORNEY, MARY BONAUTO ARGUED THE RIGHT TO MARRY THE PERSON OF ONE'S CHOICE IS PROTECTED UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW AND SHOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE ALL CITIZENS IN THIS STATE ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL. THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY, BUT MARRIAGE IS STILL A UNION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN. THE STATE WANTS TO ENCOURAGE THIS MODEL OF MARRIAGE, WHERE THERE ARE ONE PARENT OF EACH SEX. THE PLAINTIFFS, MANY OF THEM RAISING CHILDREN THEMSELVES, COMPARED THEIR FIGHT TO THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. ( man ) I HAVE ALWAYS FELT DISCRIMINATION AS A BLACK MAN, BUT CERTAINLY NOW AS A GAY MAN IN A RELATIONSHIP. NOW, IF THE HIGH COURT AGREES WITH THE PLAINTIFFS, MASSACHUSETTS WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO LEGALIZE MARRIAGE RIGHTS FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS. A DECISION IS NOT EXPECTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, THOUGH. ( man ) COME ON, BABIES ! COME ON, BABIES ! IF IT WASN'T FOR MARRIAGE, IT WOULD BE A HELL OF A DIFFERENT SOCIETY OUT HERE. I JUST THINK... THE GROUNDS FOR THE SOCIETY THAT WE'VE GOT NOW IS MARRIAGE. IN SOME RESPECTS, I THINK YOU'RE MATCHED UP LONG BEFORE YOU EVER MEET. OH, CERTAINLY, IT SERVES A FUNCTION. YOU'RE KIND OF OSTRACIZED IF YOU'RE NOT MARRIED WHEN YOU GO TO PARTIES, DANCES. IT LETS THE OTHER PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU BELONG. IF YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR MATE FOR GRANTED AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO, YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT QUITS TO START WITH. I KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN WHO SAY, &quot;OH, I DON'T WANNA--&quot; A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY-- &quot;I DON'T WANNA BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, &quot;I DON'T WANNA GET MARRIED, I DON'T WANNA BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED.&quot; IF YOU DON'T WANNA BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, YOU DON'T WANNA BE MARRIED. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE THAT'S TRUST. I WOULDN'T CALL THAT A MARRIAGE. MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WIFE, A MAN AND A WOMAN. TO ME, THAT'S THE ONLY MARRIAGE THERE IS. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING DIFFERENT. I WAS SITTING ON A PIER ON THE ARKANSAS RIVER, SITTING THERE WATCHING THE WATER GO BY ONE DAY, BEAUTIFUL DAY, HE WALKED UP BEHIND ME. WE SAT AND TALKED 'TIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. IT JUST KIND OF WENT ON FROM THERE. THIS FAD THAT IS SWEEPING THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE LEGAL BASIS FOR MARRIAGE. MARRIAGE IS VERY SIMPLE, A UNION BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN. NOT TWO MEN, OR THREE MEN, OR FOUR MEN. IT'S LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY WANT BUT THE FACT IS, IS IT RIGHT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN ? THE REALITY IS, OUR FAMILIES DO EXIST AND WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE THAT, WE NEED THE LAWS TO CATCH UP WITH THAT REALITY. A MAN AND A WOMAN, SOCIAL SCIENCE HAS SHOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN, ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN, AND THEREFORE, IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SOCIETY. MARRIAGE IS A CHOICE THAT DOES NOT TURN ON HAVING CHILDREN. NOBODY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE CHILDREN IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE WHO DO WANT TO GET MARRIED WHO ARE RAISING CHILDREN, OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO DO SO. AND THAT INCLUDES LESBIANS AND GAY MEN. THAT WILL DESTROY THE FAMILY, WHICH WILL DESTROY THE NATION. ARE WE SO WISE TODAY, THAT WE ARE READY TO REJECT 5,000 YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY ? I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE BIG LIE OF THE FAMILY VALUES DEBATE. THE IDEA THAT MARRIAGE HAS EVER BEEN SOME SOLID, STATIC, IMMOVABLE THING, AND THAT IT HAS STAYED THAT WAY FOR 6,000 YEARS. IN FACT, MARRIAGE HAS CONSTANTLY BEEN A POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND CONSTANTLY SHIFTING TO SUIT EACH CULTURE AND CLASS, EACH ERA AND ECONOMY. FOR THE FIRST 1,000 YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY, IT CONSIDERED MARRIAGE A SECULAR INSTITUTION, AND NOT UNTIL 1215 DID THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DECLARE MARRIAGE A SACRAMENT. TRADITIONALLY, THE ENGAGEMENT FEAST WAS WHEN YOU SIGNED, WITNESSED AND NOTARIZED THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT, AND THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY WAS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY EXCHANGED PROPERTY, RIGHT. THIS IS BACK IN AN ERA WHEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO WAYS OF MAKING A LIVING: LAND AND LABOR. SO EITHER-- IF YOUR FAMILY HAS PROPERTY, THEY FIND ANOTHER FAMILY WITH WHOM TO EXCHANGE IT. OR IF YOU'RE FROM THE CLASS OF BUTCHERS AND BAKERS AND CANDLESTICK MAKERS, THEN YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL BE YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER, LIFELONG. SO A FARMER REQUIRED A FARM WIFE, COULDN'T BRING IN THE EGGS OTHERWISE. FISHERMEN REQUIRED A FISH WIFE, YOU COULDN'T GET THE GOODS TO MARKET. CERTAIN GERMAN GUILDS WOULD NOT LET A MAN BECOME A MASTER UNTIL HE HAD A WIFE WHO WOULD FEED THE APPRENTICES AND KEEP THE BOOKS AND RUN THE SHOP. FEUDAL MARRIAGE IS TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. AND THE PROVERB WAS: &quot;HE WHO MARRIES FOR LOVE HAS GOOD NIGHTS AND BAD DAYS.&quot; YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. IF YOU DON'T MARRY A STABLE PARTNER WHO KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE VINEYARDS, WHICH IS A VERY SPECIALIZED SKILL, YOU'RE GOING TO STARVE. YOU HAVE TO MARRY YOUR COUSIN AND A HALF WHO HAS THE VINEYARD OVER, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS A STABLE WORKER AND HAS BEEN REALLY WELL-TRAINED IN EXACTLY THE TECHNIQUES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. OR THAT SHE HAS EXACTLY THE HALF A HOUSE THAT WILL MATCH TO YOUR HALF A HOUSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO INHERIT SO THAT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW CAN SWAP AND HAVE A WHOLE HOUSE. YOU CAN'T, YOU-- SO PEOPLE-- WHEN PEOPLE MARRY FOR MONEY IN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT FOR VENAL REASONS, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET RICH, THEY'RE DOING IT TO NOT STARVE. ( dinging bell ) WHEN MEN GET SHOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GO OFF TO WORK IN FACTORIES OR AS OWNERS OF FACTORIES OR AS ENTREPRENEURS, THEN MARRIAGE IS SUDDENLY SHAKEN FREE OF ITS MEANING. SUDDENLY ALL THAT'S LEFT IS AFFECTION AND LOVE AND SEX. SO THEN YOU START GETTING THESE HYMNS TO LOVE AND THESE HYMNS TO MOTHERHOOD AND &quot;LOVE AND MARRIAGE, LOVE AND MARRIAGE GO TOGETHER LIKE A HORSE AND CARRIAGE.&quot; THAT'S THE NEW RADICAL MARRIAGE MODEL. AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO MAKE A LIVING INDEPENDENTLY, WITHOUT A WIFE, WITHOUT A HUSBAND JUST BASED ON THEIR TALENTS AND PERSONAL EFFORT, SO DOES MARRIAGE CHANGE. ONCE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN LIVING YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE YOUR OWN PARTNER. NOW WE TALK ABOUT LOVE FIRST AND MONEY LAST. ( man shouting on helicopter radio ) ( reporter ) THIS IS UNFOLDING AS WE SPEAK. ( woman ) THEY'D ROBBED A BANK RIGHT DOWN THE STREET HERE AND APPARENTLY THEY'D COME BACK THIS WAY, CAME INTO THE PARKING LOT. LOIS GOT THE CALL THAT THEY WERE HEADED THIS WAY; SHE WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. WHEN SHE CAME OUT, THEY JUST GUNNED HER DOWN. THEY SHOT HER IN THE NECK. ( woman on police radio ) 500, and it's gonna be for an officer situation. SHE LITERALLY BLED TO DEATH. ( newscaster ) OFFICER LOIS MARRERO, 19 YEARS ON THE FORCE, DIED AT TAMPA GENERAL HOSPITAL. LOIS AND MICKIE HAD JUST CELEBRATED THEIR 10th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. IT'S JUST A TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT PLACE, MY PERSPECTIVE, THE SAME THING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. ( man ) PROBABLY BEEN ANY OFFICER ? ANY OFFICER THAT HAD BEEN IN HER SHOES THAT DAY, THE SAME ENDING WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. ( blaring bagpipes ) ( woman on police radio ) Do I have officer Lois M. Marrero on frequency ? Units be advised that 327 officer Lois M. Marrero is 10.7 for the remainder. She will never be forgotten. May she rest in peace, and God bless. ( man ) IN AS MUCH AS MICKIE ENJOYED A CARING RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PARTNER, LOIS MARRERO, SHE HAS DECIDED TO SEEK THE SURVIVING SPOUSE BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LOIS'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION FUND. MOREOVER, SHE STRONGLY FEELS THAT THIS IS WHAT LOIS WOULD HAVE WANTED. ( woman ) DO YOU THINK LOIS'S FAMILY WILL SUPPORT YOU IN THIS EFFORT ? YES, MA'AM, I DO. SHORTLY AFTER LOIS WAS KILLED, THE COMMUNITY, THE FAMILY, EVERYBODY RALLIED AROUND MICKIE. AND MICKIE WAS TREATED AS ANY OTHER SURVIVING SPOUSE WOULD BE TREATED. THE ISSUE OF MONEY KIND OF GOT RAISED AND THE FAMILY SUDDENLY TURNED ON MICKIE AND BEGAN MAKING ALL KINDS OF CRAZY ALLEGATIONS THAT LOIS WAS ALLEGEDLY HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH SOME WOMAN IN TEXAS. ( woman ) AND WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE CLAIMING THAT SOMETHING EXISTED WHEN IT DID NOT EXIST, THEN THE FAMILY IS GONNA STAND UP FOR THAT. IT'S JUST A TRUTH ISSUE. ( woman ) IF THEY WERE MARRIED AND IT WAS A HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIP, THOUGH, AND SAY THAT LOIS WAS IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE, THIS REALLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE SOMETHING WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT, WOULD IT ? YOU'RE CORRECT. IF THE STATE DID RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX UNIONS AND IF THE STATE ALSO PROVIDED A MEANS BY WHICH SAME-SEX UNIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO TERMINATE, THEN THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE. SO WE'RE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT FOR SAME SEX-UNIONS TO BE RECOGNIZED. I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE. SADLY ENOUGH FROM THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED A WEEK AGO, WE MAYBE SHOULD COME TO SOMETHING THAT'S FAIR TO ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ALL OUR EMPLOYEES. WE SEE IT AS A MORAL ISSUE. YOU TAKE THIS AWAY, THE NEXT BLOCK TO FALL WILL BE AN ARGUMENT WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL ARGUE IN FAVOR OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. THE MORALITY IS IS TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND DO THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. THE BIBLE CLEARLY STATES THAT GOD PUT TOGETHER ONE MAN AND A WOMAN. I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR GOD, SO YOUR GOD IS NOT MY GOD. I HAVE A DIFFERENT GOD. MANY MEMBERS OF THE PENSION FUND, THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE STANDING TO SAY SOMETHING, ARE WRITING LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF MICKIE. WE'VE GOT TO CONVINCE FIVE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD THAT WE'RE RIGHT. GENORA AND I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE AND ENGAGED FOR SIX YEARS. IT'S BEEN A LONG ENGAGEMENT AND, UM, WHEN WE FIRST APPLIED FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE, PEOPLE TOLD US WE WOULD NEVER WIN. BUT NOW WE ARE SO CLOSE. THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN CARE FOR EACH OTHER NOT JUST EMOTIONALLY, BUT LEGALLY AND FINANCIALLY ONCE WE GET MARRIED. WHAT THE COURTS IN HAWAII HAVE DONE IS SAYING, THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT, WE'RE ERASING 2,000 YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY AND WE'RE STARTING AFRESH. AND I THINK THEY'RE STARTING AFRESH ON A VERY SHAKY, IMMORAL AND UNSATISFACTORY BASIS, AND THAT IS HOMOSEXUAL ACTS. TODAY, THE COURT IN HAWAII HAS STRUCK A STRONG BLOW AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN MARRIAGE BASED ON SEX AND IT IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR MANY, MANY REAL LIFE FAMILIES AND COUPLES WHO NOW STAND ON THE BRINK OF BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER AMERICAN TAKES FOR GRANTED, EXERCISE THE FREEDOM TO MARRY, THE CHOICE TO MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE. ( Bob Barr ) THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US TODAY SIMPLY STANDS UP AND SAYS, &quot;ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.&quot; THE COURTS IN HAWAII ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGES, AND THESE GROUPS ARE THEN GOING TO TAKE THOSE MARRIAGE LICENSES, SO-CALLED MARRIAGE LICENSES, PIECES OF PAPER THAT PURPORT TO BE MARRIAGE LICENSES AND COME TO THE REST-- TO THE MAINLAND. SO IN AN EXERCISE OF RESPONSIBILITY, IN AN EXERCISE OF PROPER ROLE OF FEDERALISM, WE HAVE CRAFTED THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT. WHY SHOULDN'T MY PARTNER OF 13 YEARS BE ENTITLED TO THE SAME HEALTH INSURANCE AND SURVIVOR'S BENEFITS THAT INDIVIDUALS AROUND HERE, MY COLLEAGUES WITH SECOND AND THIRD WIVES, ARE ABLE TO GIVE TO THEM ? MR. CHAIRMAN, I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE SO-CALLED DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT ALL AMERICANS AS MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. LET US NOT BE GUIDED BY PREJUDICE, IGNORANCE AND FEAR. LET US NOT USE A SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION TO EMPLOY A POLITICAL STRATEGY FOR THIS ELECTION YEAR. ( chanting ) GAY RIGHTS NOW ! GAY RIGHTS NOW... THE PRESIDENT HAS A PERSONAL BELIEF RELATED TO MARRIAGE AND WHAT IT IS AND HE HAS TO ACT CONSISTENT WITH THE PERSONAL BELIEF. THIS IS THE GREATEST CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF THE DECADE. IT'S ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, IT'S ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS, AND CLINTON HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON US. OLDEST BOY, THE YOUNGEST AND THE MIDDLE ONE. &quot;GRANDPA'S BARN.&quot; GRANDKIDS MADE THAT AND I KEPT IT. THAT'S THEIR SCHOOL PICTURES. AND THIS ONE HERE THEY HAD TO GET AT WAL-MART. SO I HAVE TO PUT A FRAME UP THERE FOR THAT. AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS EARL. YEAH. WELL, NOT WHEN I MET HER, I DIDN'T. OH, AFTER I COME BACK FROM VIETNAM, I DIDN'T TRY. WHEN I CAME BACK, WE STAYED TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND DECIDED TO CALL IT QUITS. I GOT CUSTODY OF THE BOYS, AND SHE DIDN'T MIND IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN-- YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED TO A WOMAN AND MARRIED TO A MAN... HMM... OTHER THAN SEX, NOT ONE DAMN THING. ME AND HER WERE MARRIED FOR 11 YEARS, ME AND HIM WAS MARRIED FOR 23 YEARS. WHEN ME AND HER GOT MARRIED, HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID, &quot;DO YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE ?&quot; I SAID, &quot;I WILL.&quot; HE SAID-- HE LOOKED AT HER AND HE SAID, &quot;DO YOU TAKE THIS MAN TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND ?&quot; SHE SAID, &quot;I WILL.&quot; HE SAID, &quot;I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. NOW GREET YOUR BRIDE.&quot; THAT WAS IT. WITH EARL, IT WAS JUST A PRIVATE LITTLE THING BETWEEN THE TWO OF US ABOUT 10:30 AT NIGHT-- 10:45 AT NIGHT. WE SAT THERE AND DID OUR VOWS. AND I AGREED JUST, Y'KNOW, JUST AGREED TO BE ONE. &quot;'TIL DEATH DO YOU PART.&quot; WISH HE WAS HERE. ( woman ) YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE LAW REQUIRES THAT IN YOUR PENSION PLAN, YOU DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON MARITAL STATUS. THIS PENSION POLICY CURRENTLY PROVIDES A CERTAIN BENEFIT TO A MARRIED PERSON WHO IS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND THEIR SPOUSE RECEIVES A CERTAIN PENSION BENEFIT, A SUBSTANTIAL PENSION BENEFIT. A PERSON IN OFFICER MASHBURN'S SITUATION, WHOSE MARRIAGE IS NOT YET RECOGNIZED BY THE LAWS IN FLORIDA, THEY ARE DENIED THAT SAME BENEFIT THAT A HETEROSEXUAL MARRIED COUPLE IS GRANTED. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION BY AWARDING HER THE PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE DUE HER AS A SURVIVING SPOUSE. THANK YOU. NEXT WEEK-- MATTER OF FACT, NEXT WEDNESDAY MAKES IT EIGHT MONTHS THAT LOIS HAD BEEN DEAD AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT I HAVE NOT GRIEVED YET. I BOTH BASICALLY HAVE HAD TO YOU KNOW, SIT BACK AND DEFEND MYSELF FROM EVERY ANGLE. DEFEND MY RELATIONSHIP, DEFEND, YOU KNOW, OUR LIFE TOGETHER AND THAT'S SO SAD. THE LEGAL OPINIONS THAT MR. LOPER HAS RENDERED, AND WHEN I READ THE POLICY I BELIEVE THE HEIRS OF HER PENSION BENEFIT SHOULD BE THE ESTATE. AND I'M GONNA MAKE A MOTION THAT WE DENY MISS MASHBURN'S REQUEST FOR PENSION BENEFITS. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION ? ALL THOSE OPPOSED ? MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. WELL, WE WILL, AS PART OF THE ESTATE, MAKE OUR OWN FORMAL CLAIM AND APPLICATION TO RECEIVE THE PENSION BENEFITS. WE'RE RELYING STRICTLY ON WHAT THE LAW STATES. AND AGAIN, WHAT THE LAW STATES IS THAT IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, SAME-SEX MARRIAGES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR ANY PURPOSE. AND I'M GLAD THAT THE BOARD GAVE THE SAME HONOR AND DIGNITY TO HONOR THE LAW AND FOLLOW THE LAW AS OFFICER MARRERO DID IN DEDICATING HER LIFE TO ENFORCING THE LAW. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. ( woman ) BUT DON'T YOU AGREE-- PARDON ME ? SHE DEDICATED HER LIFE TO MICKIE MASHBURN TOO AND THAT'S BEING DISHONORED. WELL, HOW IS THAT BEING DISHONORED ? WASN'T SURPRISED BY WHAT HAPPENED, I WAS ALREADY PREPARED FOR THAT. I AM READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MY ATTORNEYS, AND ALL I CAN SAY IS LET'S GO TO THE FUTURE AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ( woman ) WHAT IS THE FUTURE ? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO FIGHT-- Y'KNOW, WHAT'S AHEAD NOW ? THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( woman ) THE HEART OF A MARRIAGE IS THE NEED OF TWO PEOPLE TO SHARE A LIFE, WARMLY AND CLOSELY AND FOREVER. EVEN WITH THIS VERY STRONG MOTIVATION, BOTH OF THEM WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE COMPROMISES THAT ARE INEVITABLE BEFORE TWO PEOPLE, ANY TWO PEOPLE, CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY. ( man ) SO HOW DID IT COME THAT YOU DO ALL THE COOKING ? DO YOU DO ANY OF THE COOKING, LOUIS ? HE HAS THIS WONDERFUL TALENT, AND I DON'T. YOU KNOW, ON TELEVISION, PEOPLE SAID, EVERY MAN HAD TO COOK ONE DAY A WEEK SO THAT A WIFE CAN STAY ONE DAY NO COOKING, CAN SIT DOWN, HAVE A DRINK. AND SO I SAID TO HIM HE MUST COOK ONE DAY IN THE WEEK. BUT HE DOESN'T DO IT. ( laughter ) WHAT CAN YOU DO ? THIS IS MY ROOM, HE HAS HIS ROOM OVER THERE. SO YOU DO NOT SLEEP IN THE SAME BED ? NO, HE CANNOT SLEEP WITH ME. OH, ALL RIGHT. THEN HE GET HOT AND WARM AND... ( Louis ) HE'S SNORING ALL THE TIME. MARRIAGE IS THE MOST INTIMATE BOND TWO PEOPLE CAN EVER GET INTO. AND IF YOU REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, DON'T YOU ? WE ARE TOGETHER FOR 36 YEARS, SO I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY. ( chatter ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( Louis ) IT WAS... A HAZE. I MEAN, I FELT LIKE THIS ISN'T REALLY HAPPENING. ( speaking Dutch ) ( applause ) ( woman ) IT'S VERY HAPPY, EVERYBODY'S WAVING AT YOU, AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY, AND IT'S JUST NICE ! IT'S A BIG PARTY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, THE SUN IS SHINING. IT'S WONDERFUL. ( cheering ) ( man ) I GUESS IT'S HARD TO BE MARRIED WHEN YOU'RE GAY, YOU KNOW ? ( man ) WELL, I GUESS. BUT NOT IN HOLLAND. NO, BUT I MEAN JUST BEING MARRIED AND BE GAY IS HARD. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS ? IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN A STRAIGHT RELATIONSHIP. CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT ? OH, YOU KNOW... PUT YOU ON THE SPOT ? I DON'T KNOW... WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT ALL GAY HERE SO YOU CAN ASK ME. ( laughing ) ( man ) WHY IT'S EASY FOR YOU, TELL US ? WHY IS IT EASY FOR ME, DARLING ? WHY IS IT MORE EASY FOR ME ? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NOW. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S HARDER TO KEEP A STRAIGHT-- LIKE, A GAY RELATIONSHIP MORE STEADY THAN A STRAIGHT RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW ? YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF. YES, AS WELL. WHAT ABOUT GUYS WHO GET MARRIED, THEN ? DO YOU THINK THEY'LL HAVE LONGER, MORE COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS ? NO, I THINK THAT'S BULLSHIT, IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT. WE SAW TWO FRIENDS OF OURS, THEY GOT MARRIED FOR A YEAR AGO. NOW THEY GOT DIVORCED. IT'S HAPPENING TO STRAIGHT PEOPLE, AS WELL. BUT, I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT NORMAL-- I MEAN, IT'S SO NORMAL, SO YOU'RE ONLY, YOU KNOW, WATCHING &quot;THE GAY PEOPLE,&quot; ACTUALLY, I THINK. BECAUSE, I MEAN, THE STRAIGHT PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS, AS WELL. NICE. WELL, THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL POSITIVE ARGUMENTS WHY IT IS GOOD FOR MARRIAGE IF SAME-SEX COUPLES CAN MARRY. ONE OF THEM IS THAT MARRIAGE THEN BY DEFINITION BECOMES GENDER-NEUTRAL. THAT IN A MARRIAGE WHICH IS OPEN TO SAME-SEX COUPLES YOU CANNOT HAVE A DIVIDED POSITION FOR THE HUSBAND AND FOR THE WIFE. SO IN THE WAY OF EQUALIZING THE POSITION OF MEN AND WOMEN INSIDE MARRIAGE. OPENING UP MARRIAGE TO WOMEN OR TO MEN MAY HELP. THAT MAY BE, FROM A WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE, A GOOD THING. FROM A MORE GENERAL, TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF MARRIAGE, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND THAT LESS PEOPLE WANTED TO MARRY; THEY JUST WANTED TO COHABIT. AND MARRIAGE THEREFORE BECAME LESS IMPORTANT. YOU WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF MARRIAGE WOULD BE HAPPY, THAT NOW OTHER COUPLES WANT TO JOIN THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE. AND TAKE THIS FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EACH OTHER AND TOWARDS SOCIETY IN THE SHAPE OF MARRIAGE. SO IN THAT WAY, IF MORE PEOPLE JOINED MARRIAGE, MARRIAGE WOULD BE STRONGER AND PROBABLY LAST LONGER AND BE A MORE IMPORTANT SOCIAL PHENOMENON. ( singing in Hebrew ) WHEN WE DROVE WITH THE MARRIAGE CAR TO THE CITY, THERE WAS THIS BUNCH OF OLD LADIES FROM THE SOUTH, FROM THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF LINDBERGH AND THEY WERE DOING A BICYCLE TOUR THROUGH AMSTERDAM AND THEY STOPPED WHEN THEY SAW US, &quot;A MARRIAGE, A GAY MARRIAGE !&quot; AND THEY ALL STARTED-- AND THEY WAVED AND THEY WANTED THE CAKE. THEY WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING. YES, &quot;WHERE IS THE MARRIAGE ? CAN WE COME BY TO HAVE A DRINK ?&quot; AND IT WAS FANTASTIC ! THESE OLD LADIES, IN THEIR 60s IN THEIR FLOWER SKIRTS FROM THE SOUTH. VERY CATHOLIC, STAUNCH CATHOLICS, AND THEY JUST LOVED IT. MAZEL TOV. I WANT TO SEE YOUR BABIES. I WANT TO BE-- I'M A BIT UPSET YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME TO BE MATRON OF HONOR, BUT YOU ASKED THIS GUY TO SIGN YOUR WITNESS THING. I THINK WE'RE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANTED TO MARRY IS THAT YOU ARRANGE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL AFFAIRS IN ONE STROKE. AND THAT IS EASY FOR INHERITANCE BUT ALSO FOR VISITING RIGHTS IN HOSPITALS, UM-- TRAVELING TOGETHER... TRAVELING, TAX-- BUSINESS TRIPS-- TAX, YEAH. SOCIAL SECURITY, EVERYTHING. AND IN HOLLAND, WE HAVE A SAYING THAT A COUNTRY, A CIVILIZATION, A GREAT CIVILIZATION YOU CAN JUDGE ON THE WAY IT TREATS ITS MINORITIES. AND IF IT TREATS ITS MINORITIES WELL, THEN IT'S A CIVILIZED COUNTRY. ACTUALLY THERE'S EARL'S HOUSE SHOES. I STILL GOT THEM. THAT'S ONE OF THEM. ( Sam ) YES. I WAS LOOKING FOR HIS LIVING WILL BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL WANTED IT. A COPY OF IT. I FOUND IT THE DAY AFTER HE PASSED AWAY. BUT I HAD FOUND HIS WILL. I HADN'T BROUGHT IT, BUT I THOUGHT THEY WAS BOTH TOGETHER BUT THEY WEREN'T. AND THE LADY-- THE NURSE AT THE HOSPITAL SAID THEY WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SAVE HIM. HERE'S THE FEED. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUSTED AND THOUGHT WERE YOUR REALLY GOOD FRIENDS... THEN YOU GET A LETTER LIKE THAT FROM THEM. AND BASICALLY THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO STEAL THE ESTATE FROM SAM. ( man ) THIS IS DAD'S HOME, THEY BUILT THIS HOUSE. WHEN DAD AND EARL GOT TOGETHER, THERE WAS NOTHING STANDING HERE-- NOTHING. NO BARNS, NO HOUSE, NO NOTHING. DAD AND EARL DESIGNED THIS HOUSE, THEY DESIGNED THOSE BARNS, THEY HAD THEM BUILT. DAD PUT HIS BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS INTO THIS PLACE JUST LIKE EARL DID. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT THE COUSINS CAN COME IN HERE AND SAY, &quot;JUST BECAUSE WE'RE RELATED WE GOT BLOOD KIN TO IT, WE CAN JUST COME IN HERE AND TAKE THIS PLACE.&quot; BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE TWO SIGNATURES BESIDES HIS, IT ONLY HAD ONE NOTARY PUBLIC, THEY'RE CLAIMING IT'S NOT A LEGAL WILL. ALTHOUGH, EVERYBODY AGREED IT WAS HIS SIGNATURE. NOBODY CONTESTED THAT ONE BIT. IT WAS HIS SIGNATURE ON THE WILL. ( man ) BECAUSE IT'S TWO MEN, THERE WAS NO WAY TO HAVE A MARITAL RELATIONSHIP THERE THAT THE LAW WOULD RECOGNIZE. AND SO THESE COUSINS, WHO DONATED NOTHING, HAD NO CONTACT BASICALLY WITH EARL, UH, Y'KNOW, FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS ARE GONNA BE UNJUSTLY ENRICHED. ( rooster crowing ) HEY, DAD... YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE WEAN THESE THINGS ? YOU THINK IT'S GETTIN' CLOSE TO TIME TO WEAN THESE ? YEAH, THOSE ARE READY. ( man ) SO HOW DO FEEL ABOUT THIS ? I MEAN, REALLY... IF EARL AND SAM COULD HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED, THEN YOU'D BE-- HEY, THEY WERE MARRIED. THE WAY I CONSIDER IT, THEY WERE MARRIED. THEY LIVED TOGETHER FOR 22 YEARS, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH MARRIED. YOU RARELY SEE VERY MANY STRAIGHT MARRIAGES GO PAST 15 YEARS. USUALLY THEY JUST-- ONE ANOTHER. START KILLING EACH OTHER. OCCASIONALLY, YOU SEE THE OLD COUPLES WHO'VE BEEN MARRIED 35, 40 YEARS. THAT'S THE WAY I FELT. THEY WERE MARRIED, NOTHING TO IT. JUST PARENTS TO ME. HE WAS COOL. BUSINESSLIKE, BUT HE WAS COOL. SILLY GUINEA... THERE WE GO. BIRTH OF A GUINEA ! THERE'S ( bleep ), DALE, KENNETH, DORIS, THE BOYS' MOTHER, EARL AND ME. AND IT DOES RESEMBLE ALL OF US EXCEPT THIS PART HERE, AND THIS. I'VE NEVER WORN A SCARF AROUND MY NECK IN MY LIFE. I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A LITTLE BIT ON THE NELLY SIDE. ( man ) SO THIS IS WHERE YOU MIGHT MOVE IF EVERYTHING GOES SOUR, HUH ? YEAH, IF EVERYTHING GOES SOUR, THIS WILL BE MY HOME. I'LL COME AND REDO THIS AND MOVE HERE. NOT MUCH ELSE I CAN DO. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HOMOSEXUALS REALLY WANT TO MARRY. I THINK THEY WANT TO DESTROY MARRIAGE AND THEN RECREATE IT IN THEIR OWN-- ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION WITH ALL OF THE BENEFITS BUT WITHOUT THE COMMITMENT THAT DEPENDS-- THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO CHILDREN-- WHY WOULD THEY WANNA DESTROY MARRIAGE ? IF THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT, WHY DO THEY WANNA BE MARRIED ? I DON'T THINK THEY WANNA BE MARRIED, MOST OF THEM. TODAY IS VALENTINE'S DAY IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR FRIENDS IN CANADA. WE'RE GOING ALL OUT TO OUR COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICES TO GET MARRIED. HE AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 18 YEARS. THE ONE THING I WANNA DO BEFORE WE DIE IS TO MARRY LEGALLY. WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR 24th ANNIVERSARY. WE JUST FEEL WE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO LEGALLY MARRY. WHAT'S THE LETTER SAY, IS IT A REJECTION LETTER ? IT SAYS &quot;THE CLERK ONLY ISSUES MARRIAGE LICENSE ONLY TO AN UNMARRIED MALE AND AN UNMARRIED FEMALE.&quot; OKAY, BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH UNMARRIED MALES. DO YOU THINK GAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE MARRIED ? I MEAN, YOU MARRY PEOPLE EVERYDAY, RIGHT ? WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL BE BACK NEXT YEAR ON VALENTINE'S DAY AGAIN. AND WE'LL ENCOURAGE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO COME UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO MARRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. WE HAVE A SON WHO IS GAY WHO IS IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER MAN AND HE CAN'T GET MARRIED ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE WANNA KNOW WHY OUR SON IS BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE GOT A LICENSE TODAY. IT REALLY WOULD BE. UM, I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CITY'S READY BUT WE'VE BEEN READY. YES, I'D LIKE A MARRIAGE LICENSE APPLICATION. WHERE ARE THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM ? THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM HAVE TO BE TOGETHER. COME ON, DEAR, HONEY, COME OVER HERE. THAT'S US. FILL THIS FORM OUT AND GET IN LINE ALL THE WAY AGAINST THE WALL TO MY RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, AN APPLICATION FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE, PLEASE. NOW YOU'RE REALLY CONFUSING ME. NO, NOT AT ALL. BRIDE AND GROOM CAN GET AN APPLICATION FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE, BUT GROOM AND GROOM... WHY NOT ? MY OTHER TWO SISTERS-- THE OTHER TWO, THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING CONFUSED HERE. THEY'RE COMING UP BRIDE AND BRIDE, BRIDE AND BRIDE AND THEN GROOM AND GROOM. WE NEED TO GET YOU A DOMESTIC. NO, WE WANNA GET MARRIED. YOU CAN HAVE A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP. YEAH, WE DON'T WANNA DO THAT, WE WANNA DO THIS. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT... ( woman ) IT TOOK BRAVERY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDOW 50 YEARS AGO TO STOP SEPARATE AND EQUAL, SEPARATE BUT EQUAL LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE'RE NOT EVEN SEPARATE AND EQUAL, WE'RE NOT EVEN SEPARATE AND EQUAL, WE'RE SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL. DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP IS VERY UNEQUAL TO LEGAL MARRIAGE. AND HE SAID, &quot;THIS IS THE BOTTOM OF THE TOTEM POLE, &quot;YOU HAVE TO WORK ABOVE-- Y'KNOW, HAVE TO WORK ON THE TOP.&quot; SO AS I LEFT, I'M LIKE, &quot;WELL, SEGREGATED COFFEE SHOPS WERE THE BOTTOM OF THE TOTEM POLE.&quot; IT WOULD HELP ME TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOU THINK IT WOULD COST YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, TO RUN ONE APPLICATION THROUGH AS A-- WE WON'T DO IT. I KNOW YOU WON'T BUT I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU WHY, LIKE WHAT IT WOULD COST YOU. LET ME BE CLEAR, NOT WHAT IT COSTS ME, THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I AM BANNED FROM ISSUING A LICENSE. NOW, IF I GET AN ORDER FROM A COURT ORDERING ME TO GIVE YOU A LICENSE, I HAVE NO IF'S OR BUT'S ABOUT IT, I WILL DO IT. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW, I CANNOT DO THAT UNDER THE LAW. YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THAT THE PEOPLE ARE SYMPATHETIC LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL IN THEIR LIVES BUT IT'S AN INSTITUTIONAL THING THAT'S BEEN CARRIED FOR YEARS AND IT'S LARGE. AND ALSO, THE KIND OF LAZINESS THAT COMES WITH BUREAUCRACY WHERE IT'S JUST LIKE, &quot;WELL, I DON'T FEEL LIKE CHANGING IT, &quot;YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE CHANGING IT. GO SEE THE GUY DOWN THE HALL.&quot; AND I GUESS THIS IS JUST THE WAY TO DO IT, ONE LITTLE CHIP AT A TIME. SO... WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE SOUTH DURING THE '40s AND THE '50s, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT REGION BELIEVED THAT BLACK PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ENTER PLACES OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION. AND THEY FELT THAT BLACK PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE. AND MANY PEOPLE FELT THAT WAS RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS WRONG. I THINK AS POLITICIANS, AS ELECTED OFFICIALS, WE SHOULD NOT ONLY FOLLOW BUT WE MUST LEAD, LEAD OUR DISTRICTS. YOU CANNOT TELL PEOPLE THEY CANNOT FALL IN LOVE. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. USED TO SAY WHEN PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES, AND I QUOTE, &quot;RACES DO NOT FALL IN LOVE AND GET MARRIED. INDIVIDUALS FALL IN LOVE AND GET MARRIED.&quot; WHY DON'T YOU WANT YOUR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN, YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS, TO BE HAPPY ? WHY DO YOU ATTACK THEM ? WHY DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY THE LOVE THEY HOLD IN THEIR HEARTS ? WHY DO YOU WANT TO CRUSH THEIR HOPES, THEIR DREAMS, THEIR LONGINGS, THEIR ASPIRATIONS ? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS. PEOPLE LIKE YOU. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED, BUY A HOUSE AND SPEND THEIR LIVES WITH THE ONE THEY LOVE. THEY HAVE DONE NO WRONG. ( thud ) WHAT ? WHO'S THE WOMAN YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH, SON ? I'M HIS WIFE. WHAT ? NOT HERE YOU AIN'T. IN THE EARLY '60s, RICHARD LOVING, A WHITE MAN, AND MILDRED JETER, A BLACK WOMAN, FELL IN LOVE AND WANTED TO GET MARRIED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO SO BECAUSE THE LAW IN THEIR STATE DEFINED MARRIAGE AS ONLY BETWEEN PEOPLE OF THE &quot;RIGHT&quot; RACES. AND SO RICHARD AND MILDRED LEFT VIRGINIA AND WENT AND GOT MARRIED. SOMETIME LATER, THEY'RE AWAKENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND WERE ACTUALLY ARRESTED BY SHERIFFS AND POLICE OFFICIALS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, WHO CHARGED THEM WITH THE &quot;CRIME&quot; OF WRONGFUL MARRIAGE, OF MARRYING THE WRONG KIND OF PERSON. ON THE COUNT OF MISCEGENATION, I FIND DEFENDANT RICHARD PERRY LOVING AND DEFENDANT MILDRED DELORES JETER GUILTY AS CHARGED. AND THE JUDGE TOLD THEM THAT THEY COULD EITHER SPEND THE NEXT YEAR IN JAIL OR COULD GO INTO EXILE FOR 25 YEARS, LEAVING THE STATE OF VIRGINIA. THE COUPLE CHOSE TO REMAIN MARRIED AND LEAVE THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, AND THEY WENT TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND GOT A LAWYER. COURT AFTER COURT UPHELD THIS HORRIBLE LAW AND SAID THAT THIS WAS THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE. ONE JUDGE WROTE, FOR EXAMPLE, &quot;ALMIGHTY GOD...&quot; ALMIGHTY GOD CREATED THE RACES-- WHITE, BLACK, YELLOW, MALAY, AND RED. AND HE PLACED THEM ON SEPARATE CONTINENTS. AND BUT FOR THE INTERFERENCE WITH HIS ARRANGEMENT, THERE WOULD BE NO CAUSE FOR SUCH MARRIAGES. THE FACT THAT HE SEPARATED THE RACES SHOWS THAT HE DID NOT INTEND FOR THE RACES TO MIX. AND GOD'S DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE-- GOD'S DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE-- THE SEPARATION OF THE RACES WOULD REMAIN INTACT, AND HE UPHELD THIS RESTRICTION. SO DID THE VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT. WELL, WHEN THAT CASE CAME FROM THE VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, THE STATE'S ATTORNEYS WERE STILL ARGUING THAT THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE ITSELF MEANT THAT THIS COUPLE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE MARRIED. MARRIAGE DOES NOT MEAN TWO MEN OR TWO WOMEN GETTING MARRIED; IT JUST DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THEY ARGUED THAT, IF WE ALLOWED INTERRACIAL COUPLES TO MARRY, SOCIETY WOULD FALL APART. IF MARRIAGE GOES, THEN THE FAMILY GOES. AND IF THE FAMILY GOES, WE HAVE NONE OF THE DECENCY OR ORDERED LIBERTY WHICH AMERICANS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO ENJOY AND TO APPRECIATE. THEY ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE CHILDREN. SHOULD WE TELL THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA THAT, IN THE EYES OF THE LAW, THE PARTIES TO A HOMOSEXUAL UNION ARE ENTITLED TO ALL THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AND BENEFITS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESERVED FOR A MAN AND A WOMAN UNITED IN MARRIAGE ? THEY ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO DIFFERENT STATES THAT DIDN'T WANT TO ALLOW THESE &quot;KINDS OF COUPLES&quot; TO MARRY. NO ONE STATE OF THE UNION CAN HAVE ITS DECISION OF ITS PEOPLE OVERRIDDEN, RUN ROUGHSHOD, BY PEOPLE FROM-- JUDGES FROM-- ANOTHER STATE. THEY MADE VERY MUCH THE SAME KINDS OF ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEAR TODAY MADE TO DEFEND SEX DISCRIMINATION IN MARRIAGE. BUT FORTUNATELY, IN 1967, UNLIKE IN PREVIOUS CASES, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAD HAD ENOUGH. AND THE COURT RULED THAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY, THAT IT IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT, A BASIC FREEDOM, AND THE COURT STRUCK THAT BAN DOWN. ( man ) WHEN YOUR CHILDREN GROW UP, HOW WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO MARRY ? WELL, I THINK I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO THEM. THEY'LL DECIDE THAT FOR THEMSELVES. Tampa police officer's pension benefits isn't over. Officer Lois Marrero died in a bank robber's ambush last July. ( Mickie Mashburn ) I'M PROUD OF WHO I AM AND WHO I WAS WITH. SO I'M VERY DRIVEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN. AND I THINK I HAVE A LOT OF THAT FROM LOIS'S ALSO DOING THAT, BECAUSE LOIS WAS SO DRIVEN IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IF YOU TOLD HER, &quot;WELL, YOU REALLY CAN'T DO THAT,&quot; SHE'D GO, &quot;OH, IT'S GONNA BE DONE. I WILL GET IT DONE. I WILL ACHIEVE IT SOMEHOW.&quot; AND SHE ALWAYS DID. SO I GUESS THAT'S WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW. IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MARRY LEGALLY, THAT, OBVIOUSLY, IS ONE OF THE... PENSION-- ONE OF THE... I THINK JUST THE TWO-- YOU HAVE TO EITHER BE LEGALLY MARRIED OR HAVE LEGAL DEPENDENTS THAT YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR PENSION TO. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO CASES PRIOR TO JULY THIRD. ( man ) SO WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ? WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN THIS BOARD HEARING ? NO, THERE WOULD BE NO BOARD HEARING WHATSOEVER. IT WOULD BE AN AUTOMATIC. AND THERE WOULD BE NO QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER AS TO THE STATUS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IT WOULDN'T MATTER. ( woman ) DO YOU SWEAR THAT THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE IN THE CAUSE NOW PENDING SHALL BE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH ? I DO. I DO. LOIS MARRERO WAS KILLED ON JULY 6, 2001 BEFORE SHE EVER HAD A CHANCE TO DESIGNATE MICKIE AS HER BENEFICIARY. AND MICKIE'S CLAIM IS BASED ON THIS VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 185. SHE'S HERE TODAY ASKING THE BOARD TO CORRECT THAT VIOLATION IN THE ONLY WAY THAT'S POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AND THAT IS BY YOU ALL AS A FACT-FINDING BODY MAKING A DETERMINATION AS TO WHO LOIS WOULD HAVE NAMED AS HER BENEFICIARY IF SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN HER LEGAL RIGHT TO DO THAT. ( woman ) MS. MORGAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW MICKIE AND LOIS ? THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS AND MY NEIGHBORS. ( Shannon Minter ) SO THEY WERE BOTH YOUR NEIGHBORS AND YOUR PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUES ? THAT'S CORRECT. WERE YOU AWARE THAT LOIS AND MICKIE HAD BEEN MARRIED, WERE MARRIED ? YEAH, I REMEMBER WHEN THEY STARTED DATING. BY THE TIME LOIS WAS KILLED, WERE MOST PEOPLE ON THE FORCE THAT LOIS WORKED WITH-- MICKIE AND LOIS WORKED WITH AWARE THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP ? EVERYBODY WAS. AND DID MOST PEOPLE ACCEPT THAT AND RESPECT THAT ? OF COURSE. I HAD NO IDEA. ONE DAY I SEEN-- I WAS TALKING TO LOIS, AND I NOTICED SHE HAD A RING. AND THEN IT WAS A COUPLE DAYS LATER, MAYBE A WEEK, I SAW MICKIE HAD ONE, AND I JUST THOUGHT, &quot;OH WOW, THEY HAVE THE SAME RING.&quot; AND I WAS TALKING TO A NEIGHBOR WHO SAID, &quot;WELL, DON'T YOU KNOW ?&quot; AND I SAID, &quot;NO.&quot; AND NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M GOING, &quot;THAT IS SO COOL.&quot; I JUST, I WAS JUST, I WAS BLOWN AWAY. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL. NOW, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IS A HOLY UNION ? A HOLY UNION IS ASKING GOD'S BLESSING UPON A COUPLE, ENCOURAGING AND AFFIRMING THEM IN A PUBLIC WAY, TO ENCOURAGE A RELATIONSHIP, NOT UNLIKE A HOLY MATRIMONY. IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE, IT'S THE SAME THING. AND DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE PARTICIPANTS ARE MAKING A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO ONE ANOTHER ? OH, YES. NOW, IF A SAME-SEX COUPLE WHO HAVE UNDERGONE A HOLY UNION CEREMONY WANT TO TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP, DOES THE CHURCH HAVE ANY KIND OF PROVISION FOR THAT ? YES, IF YOU'VE HAD A HOLY UNION IN THE METROPOLITAN COMMUNITY CHURCHES, YOU HAVE TO FIND THE PASTOR WHO PERFORMED THAT CEREMONY, AND A RITE OF DISSOLUTIONMENT-- A DOCUMENT OF DISSOLUTIONMENT IS WRITTEN, AND ALL PARTIES WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THAT CEREMONY HAVE TO SIGN THAT DOCUMENT. AND PRIOR TO LOIS'S DEATH, DID EITHER MICKIE OR LOIS CONTACT THE M.C.C. CHURCH TO FILE FOR A DISSOLUTION ? NO, THEY DID NOT. DURING YOUR WEDDING CEREMONY, DID YOU AND LOIS EXCHANGE RINGS ? AH, WE DID EXCHANGE RINGS. MATTER OF FACT, HER SISTER AND HER BROTHER-IN-LAW HAD THE RINGS AND THEY WERE GIVEN TO US, AND LOIS PLACED THE RING ON MY FINGER AND I PLACED THE RING ON HER FINGER. AND DID YOU AND LOIS CONTINUE WEARING THOSE WEDDING BANDS ? UP UNTIL THE DAY THAT SHE WAS KILLED. AND YOU WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT WHEN MICKIE LEARNED THAT LOIS HAD BEEN KILLED, HAD BEEN SHOT ? YES. AND YOU WERE ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT INFORMED HER ? YES. WHAT WERE SOME OF MICKIE'S CONCERNS AS YOU TOLD HER ? CAN YOU JUST TELL US BRIEFLY ? UM... UH, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WAS THAT SHE WANTED TO GO TO LOIS. AND MYSELF AND ANOTHER OF THE OFFICERS IN THERE, WE BASICALLY PICKED HER UP BY THE ELBOWS AND MOVED HER INTO THE SERGEANT'S OFFICE WHERE IT WAS A LITTLE ROOMIER AND GOT HER INTO A DIFFERENT CHAIR. I WAS CONCERNED THAT SHE MIGHT BE WEAK OR UPSET AND THAT SHE COULD FALL OR SOMETHING, AND I DIDN'T WANT HER TO HURT HERSELF. AND BY THE TIME WE GOT HER SEATED, MY HUSBAND CALLED COMMUNICATIONS TO TRY TO GET MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE MICKIE KEPT ASKING IF SHE WAS GONE. AND MY HUSBAND SAID THAT HE TALKED TO RADIO AND THAT LOIS COULD STILL BE ALIVE, THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON HER. AND THEN ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO PASSED, AND MICKIE SAID, &quot;SHE'S GONE.&quot; AND I SAID, &quot;MICKIE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YET, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.&quot; SHE SAID, &quot;YEAH, SHE'S GONE. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY HEART THAT SHE'S GONE.&quot; AND THEN SHE SAID, &quot;PLEASE TAKE ME TO HER, PLEASE TAKE ME TO HER.&quot; AND MICKIE INSISTED THAT I GO TO FIND BRENDA-- MICKIE WAS CONCERNED THAT LOIS'S MOTHER WOULD TURN ON THE TV BECAUSE IT WAS LUNCHTIME AND SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE NEWS, SO SHE SAID, &quot;PLEASE GET TO BRENDA SO SHE CAN GET TO LOIS'S MOM SO THAT LOIS'S MOM WON'T JUST FLIP THE TV ON AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.&quot; DID MICKIE INVITE YOU TO BE A PALLBEARER AT LOIS'S FUNERAL ? YES, SHE DID. AND DO YOU RECALL WHERE MICKIE WAS SITTING AT THE FUNERAL ? SHE WAS SITTING UP FRONT, ONE OF THE FIRST PEWS IN THE CHURCH. AND DO YOU RECALL WHAT THE CHIEF DID WITH THE FLAG ON LOIS'S COFFIN ? WHEN-- AT THE CEREMONY, AT THE CEMETERY, HE HANDED OFF THE FLAG TO HER, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH A SPOUSE OR A LIFE PARTNER. ( Karen Doering ) IF LOIS HAD BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DESIGNATE A BENEFICIARY, WHO WOULD SHE HAVE DESIGNATED ? WITHOUT A DOUBT, MICKIE MASHBURN. BASED ON YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH LOIS, IF SHE'D BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DESIGNATE A BENEFICIARY TO RECEIVE HER PENSION DEATH BENEFITS, WHO DO YOU THINK THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN ? IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MICKIE. DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT ? NO DOUBT AT ALL. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MICKIE. NOT AT THIS TIME. NO, SIR. NOT AT THIS TIME. ( man ) I GOT IT, RIGHT HERE. I REALLY HAVE TO GET MYSELF TOGETHER 'CAUSE I'M TIRED, AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND TALK TO EVERYBODY A LITTLE BIT LATER. YOU WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE AN OPEN HEART AND AN OPEN MIND. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT SPOKE TODAY SPOKE FROM THEIR HEARTS AND SPOKE THE TRUTH. THE LAW HAS TO CHANGE, NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF, FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS. IT'S LIKE WAS STATED IN THE HEARING TODAY, THIS IS NOT A GAY ISSUE, THIS IS EVERYONE'S ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING AND STRIVING TOWARDS. SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT OPENING UP OF MARRIAGE TO SAME-SEX COUPLES WOULD RUIN THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE. I WOULD SAY TO THAT THAT THE CHANGE INVOLVED WITH OPENING UP MARRIAGE IS FAR LESS THAN THE MORE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT-- WELL, IF PEOPLE REALLY CANNOT GET ON WITH EACH OTHER THEY CAN DIVORCE. DIVORCE IS PROBABLY A MUCH BIGGER CHANGE TO TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE THAN THE ENTRY OF SAME-SEX COUPLES. AND PROBABLY, ALSO, A BIG CHANGE IN MARRIAGE LAW WAS THAT THE WOMAN USED TO BE SUBJECT TO THE COMMANDS AND WISHES OF THE HUSBAND. MOST MARRIAGE LAWS HAVE CHANGED THAT AND THEREBY, MARRIAGE HAS BECOME AN INSTITUTION OF TWO EQUALS. ( woman ) BY 1920 AND 1930 EVERY THIRD MAGAZINE ARTICLE IS SAYING THIS IS THE END OF MARRIAGE AS WE KNOW IT. THIS IS THE DEATH OF THE FAMILY. THIS IS THE PERIOD OF THE COLLAPSE OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE BECAUSE SUDDENLY YOUNGSTERS ARE BEHAVING BIZARRELY. THEY'RE DATING, NOT ON THE FRONT PORCH BUT OUT, OUTSIDE OF THEIR PARENTS' VIEW, AND THEY'RE MARRYING FOR LOVE, AND THEY'RE HAVING SEX WITH CONTRACEPTION RATHER THAN JUST SETTLING DOWN RIGHT AWAY TO WORK HARD AND RAISE BABIES. FOR 50, 75 YEARS, EVEN DISCUSSING CONTRACEPTION WAS CONSIDERED DISGUSTING, FILTHY AND PRURIENT IN SOME TERRIBLE WAY. THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN HAVE SEX, NOT JUST FOR MAKING BABIES BUT FOR MAKING INTIMACY, FOR MAKING LOVE, IS THE IDEA THAT'S ENDORSED BY LEGAL CONTRACEPTION. THAT WAS ALREADY ENDORSED IN GRISWOLD VERSUS CONNECTICUT, WHEN THE SUPREME COURT KNOCKED DOWN THE LAST REMAINING LAW BANNING THE USE OF CONTRACEPTION. AS A SOCIETY, WE HAVE DECIDED THAT MAKING LOVE IS A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR HAVING SEX AND FOR BEING MARRIED. THIS IS THE PHILOSOPHY SAME-SEX COUPLES FIT UNDER. SOMETIMES, MARRIED PEOPLE DON'T STAY IN LOVE. WHAT MOTHER? A HUSBAND AND THE WIFE FALL OUT OF LOVE. WHY DO THEY DO THAT? THE SECOND BIG BATTLE OVER PUBLIC MARRIAGE PHILOSOPHY THAT LEADS TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS THE BATTLE OVER DIVORCE. THEY GET UNMARRIED, YOU SEE. NO. WELL, THEY DO, THAT'S ALL. THEY GET-- THEY GET WHAT IS CALLED A DIVORCE. AGAIN, NEARLY SPLIT THE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS. CATHOLICS, THEY HAD DECIDED THAT ALREADY-- NEVER. BUT THE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS WERE TURNED INSIDE OUT OVER THE DEBATE OF WHETHER DIVORCE MIGHT BE LEGAL FOR CAUSES OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL PROTESTANT CAUSES OF ATTEMPTED MURDER OR ADULTERY. AGAIN, THE PUBLIC MARRIAGE PHILOSOPHY DECIDED THAT WHEN YOU LOVE YOU MARRY, AND WHEN LOVE IS GONE, YOU ARE NO LONGER REALLY MARRIED. IT IS NO LONGER REALLY A FULLY MORAL MARRIAGE. AND IF MARRIAGE IS MADE BY LOVE, SAME-SEX COUPLES BELONG. ( Sam ) A LOT OF DIFFERENT KIND OF BUGS, GRASSHOPPERS. ( Sam ) THIS IS COUNTRY. DIFFERENT KIND OF GRASSES. GUESS EVERYTHING HAS A RIGHT TO LIVE. I JUST WISH SOME PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE US ALONE... THE WORMS WOULD LEAVE US ALONE... WORMS AND SCUMBAGS. HURTS A LOT, BUT... DAD AND EARL, Y'KNOW, DAD WOULD SELL STUFF, HE TOOK CARE OF THE TAXES, TOOK CARE OF ALL THE RECEIPTS ON THE PROPERTY. DAD WOULD GO UP AND PAY THE TAXES. OF COURSE IT WAS ALL IN EARL'S NAME, BUT HE WENT UP AND PAID IT. AND IT'S JUST REALLY SCREWED UP BECAUSE, WHEN EARL PASSED AWAY, Y'KNOW, ALL DAD HAD WAS ABOUT $2,000 TO HIS NAME. AND WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER WE BURIED EARL, IT WAS ALL TIED UP IN COURT. ( Sam ) AND I'VE GOTTA CALL THAT ELECTRIC COMPANY 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA TURN MY ELECTRIC OFF IF I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IT. I NEED 900 AND SOME DOLLARS. I CAN TAKE THAT STUFF UP HERE AND SELL IT BETTER THAN THEY CAN OVER THERE. WELL, I DON'T HAVE THE $95, DO YOU ? I WAS GOING TO GO SEE IF I COULDN'T GET IT. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GET IT ? I'M NOT TELLING YOU. ( Sam ) $95 WOULD GIVE HIM A BOOST FOR A MONTH IN THE FLEA MARKET. HOW MUCH MONEY COULD YOU COME UP WITH ? NOT THAT MUCH. HOW MUCH ? WELL, SCRAP ! I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THESE HORSES TO THAT SALE TOO, AND JUST SELL 'EM FOR WHAT I CAN GET OUT OF THEM. I HATE DOIN' THAT 'CAUSE I THINK THE WORLD OF MY HORSES. LIKE SELLING A PART OF YOU, BUT... SEE, SOMEBODY CUT MY FENCE RIGHT OVER THERE IN THE CORNER. SEE WHAT THEY DID TO THE DOOR ? YEAH, MAN. THE FIRE WENT RIGHT DOWN THIS WAY. WENT RIGHT OUT, AND IT BURNT THE DOOR FACINGS AS IT WENT. ALL THE DOOR FACINGS, CLEAR OUT THE FRONT DOOR. BURNT THE FRONT DOOR OUT. DIDN'T BOTHER-- DIDN'T HURT THE BED IN THERE THAT MUCH, JUST SMOKED IT A LITTLE BIT. WHICH IS FUNNY, BECAUSE WHY WOULD IT CATCH ALL THESE DOOR FACINGS ON FIRE ? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. UNLESS SOMEBODY POURED SOMETHING ON IT AND POURED SOMETHING HERE. THE FLOWERS STILL BLOOM. SO, IT'S JUST... ONE BIG MESS OF GREEDY GRAVE ROBBERS. EARL'S DAD, PAPA. THIS WAS GRANNY, EARL'S MOTHER, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG. BETTY LOU WOULD GIVE HER LEFT NUT TO HAVE ONE OF THEM, AND SHE AIN'T GOT ONE, BUT SHE'D GIVE HER OLE BOYFRIEND'S ONE, LEFT NUT. SOMEBODY BEEN IN THIS ONE. BOY, THEY HAD FLAT COME IN AND STOLE STUFF. MY GOD, THEY STOLE AND THEY STOLE. HI, SQUIRT-SQUIRT. ( banging ) ANGEL, WALK UP THE GATE, COME UP BEHIND HIM... ( hooting ) ( banging ) GET IN THERE... GET IN THERE, LOAD UP. HI, IRENE, THIS IS SAM. I'VE GOTTA COME UP WITH 400 BY TOMORROW ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK AND I-- WELL, ACTUALLY 500, BUT I GOT 100 OF IT-- AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S SOME WAY I CAN GET IT, BORROW IT FROM SOMEBODY UNTIL TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK AND GIVE IT BACK TO 'EM. OKAY, AND I'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE. AND I DO APPRECIATE IT. THANKS A LOT, IRENE. THANKS, BYE. THAT'S EARL'S GRAVE. THAT'S HIS MOTHER, AND THAT'S HIS DAD, AND THAT'S MINE OVER THERE. I WISH THEY'D START PUTTING FLOWERS ON MINE. I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY FLOWERS BEFORE I GO. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY PUT ON THERE AFTER I'M DEAD. THAT'S FINE. THIS IS WHERE I WAS GONNA GET MY-- HAVE MY GRAVE. BUT SOME WOMAN BOUGHT IT. THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHO. SAID SHE BOUGHT IT THE DAY BEFORE. I ALWAYS FIGURED IT WAS BETTY LOU, BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. ( man ) SO DOES IT UPSET YOU, YOU WON'T BE RIGHT NEXT TO EARL ? IT BOTHERS ME. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH MYSELF, IF SOMEBODY HANDED ME A WILL AND SAID, &quot;THIS IS WHAT I WANT IN IT,&quot; AND THEN I SAY, &quot;I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU GOT IN YOUR WILL, I'M GONNA FIGHT IT.&quot; THIS HAS BEEN UNCLE SAM'S HOME FOR THE LAST 24, 25 YEARS, AND HERE THEY ARE WANTIN' TO TAKE IT AWAY. HOW WOULD THEY FEEL IF THIS WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM ? SAY, HER HUSBAND'S KIDS COME IN AND SAID, &quot;UH, I WANT YOU OUT.&quot; ( applauding ) OUR AIM IS A DEMOCRATIC PEACE, A PEACE FOUNDED UPON THE DIGNITY AND RIGHTS OF EVERY MAN AND WOMAN. ( applauding ) WHEN I CAME TO THIS ROSTRUM ON SEPTEMBER THE 20th, 2001, I BROUGHT THE POLICE SHIELD OF A FALLEN OFFICER, MY REMINDER OF LIVES THAT ENDED IN A TASK THAT DOES NOT END. I AM A NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICER. I WAS THE TYPE OF GUY THAT WAS GAY AND HAPPY AND LIVING IN HIDING. I DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY HEART, 'CAUSE I HAD THE WORLD, I HAD A LIFE PARTNER WHO WAS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD TO ME, Y'KNOW ? 17 MONTHS AGO, ON SEPTEMBER 11th, I LOST THAT MAN, THE ONE MAN THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH. I RAN INTO THAT BUILDING WHEN IT WAS COMING DOWN, AND I'M SAYING, &quot;THIS ISN'T HAPPENING. MY EDDY'S IN THERE, MY FRIENDS ARE IN THERE.&quot; I DIDN'T SAY, &quot;LET ME JUST SAVE THE GAY PEOPLE.&quot; LET'S SAVE EVERYBODY. ( woman ) SHE WAS FINALLY IDENTIFIED ON THE 12th OF OCTOBER. THEY HAD DONE THE CREMATION, AND THEY DELIVERED THE BOX DOWN. SHE GAVE HER LIFE FOR THE COUNTRY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT. ( woman ) WE'RE THE CRIMINAL INJURIES COMPENSATION FUND. AND WE'RE DESIGNED TO HELP VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME WITH COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRIME. THE SECRETARY CAME TO ME AND SAID, &quot;YEAH, THIS PERSON IS INELIGIBLE UNDER THE LAW,&quot; AND WE STRUGGLED WITH WHAT TO SAY. WE UNDERSTAND OUR SPECIAL CALLING. THIS GREAT REPUBLIC WILL LEAD THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. WHERE IS THE DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WHEN OUR RIGHTS ARE NOT RESPECTED ? CURRENTLY OUR GOVERNMENT IS SAYING, YOU KNOW, DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SENT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY. I'M FROM ARGENTINA. I CAME TO NEW YORK AND I MET JESSE THREE YEARS AGO, AND I FELL IN LOVE. AND I MOVE HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE WITH MY LOVE. EVEN IF MARRIAGE BECOMES LEGAL IN MASSACHUSETTS, THE DISCRIMINATORY LAW OF THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT STILL NEEDS TO BE REPEALED AND STRUCK DOWN SO THAT OUR MARRIAGE WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON A FEDERAL LEVEL, AND MAX WILL RECEIVE A GREEN CARD. WHERE'S THE COMPASSION WHEN THIS COUNTRY IS FORCING US TO LEAVE ? ( Major Jane E. Castor ) YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS THEIR PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE PENSION BOARD PROBABLY WANTED TO VOTE TO GIVE MICKIE THAT PENSION. AND, YOU KNOW, THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE JUST BOUND BY THE LAW. THE LAW STATES THAT YOU HAVE TO BE LEGALLY MARRIED IN ORDER TO GIVE IT. WELL, WE'RE FIXING TO GO INTO EIGHT MONTHS, AND IT'S WEIRD, IT'S HARD. BUT I HAVE THE MEMORIES. YOU KNOW, YOU TRY TO SIT BACK AND THINK THAT LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME SHE WAS STILL ALIVE, YOU KNOW, AND, FOR, YOU KNOW, VALENTINE'S, SHE... WHERE YOU SEND OUT, SEND OFF FOR CARE BEARS-- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE CALLED, BUT YOU SEND THEM OFF AND THEY MAKE THE BEARS AND THEY SEND THEM BACK TO YOU. WELL, THAT'S WHAT SHE GOT ME LAST YEAR FOR FEBRUARY 14th. SHE BOUGHT ME ROSES AND SHE HAD ONE OF THOSE BEARS SENT TO ME. SO YOU KIND OF, YOU SIT BACK AND YOU THINK OF THAT. AND YOU THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT A YEAR CHANGES. AND IT'S HARD. ( woman ) WE'VE HAD OUR CEREMONY WITH OUR FAMILY AND EVERYTHING LIKE THIS, AND NOW THIS IS THE LEGAL THING. I MEAN IT'S NOT-- YOU KNOW, THE BEST IT COULD BE WOULD BE IN THE UNITED STATES BEING MARRIED, BUT HERE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF ICING THAT ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF, JUST LIKE, THIS FEELS GOOD. LIVING IN A CONSERVATIVE AREA OF THE UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY, THERE IS SOME ANXIETY AROUND WHAT COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL PROTECTIONS THAT JUST COME WITH BEING MARRIED. OH, WOW. ( man ) I, PAM... I, PAM... TAKE THEE JENNY... TAKE THEE JENNY... TO BE MY WEDDED SPOUSE... TO BE MY WEDDED SPOUSE... FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE... FOR RICH OR FOR POOR... FOR RICH OR FOR POOR... IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH... IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH... I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU TO BE LEGALLY MARRIED SPOUSES. GOTTA DO THE OFFICIAL KISS. YEAH, YEAH, FOR SURE. ( honking ) HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE ON THIS ROUTE IS AMAZING. EVERY CORNER YOU JUST SEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IT'S GREAT. THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEALS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT SAME-SEX COUPLES HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO MARRY. OUR CABINET AND PRIME MINISTER HAVE AFFIRMED THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT EQUAL MARRIAGE, SO AS OF RIGHT NOW, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN CANADA. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COUPLES HERE WHO ARE GETTING MARRIED, SO IT'S A GREAT DAY TO CELEBRATE HERE AT TORONTO PRIDE. WE LOVE IT, WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED. ARE YOU? NO, I WILL, I'M ENGAGED. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO MARRY IF THEY WANT TO. IT'S ABOUT TIME. YOU SORT OF FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG IN THE WORLD INSTEAD OF SOME OUTSIDE STRANGER. I MEAN, WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. IF HUMAN BEINGS CAN'T COMMIT TO EACH OTHER, I MEAN, WHAT IS THERE? IT'S ABOUT TIME. THAT'S WHY WE CAME OUT TO CELEBRATE. NOT IN MY WHOLE LIFETIME, SO IT FEELS GOOD. DON'T MAKE ME CRY, I'M GONNA CRY. DON'T MAKE ME CRY. HAPPY PRIDE ! IF YOU DON'T LIKE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, DON'T HAVE ONE. ( cheering ) YEAH, IT'S LONG OVERDUE. LONG OVERDUE. IT'S A GREAT THING. WE GOT MARRIED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF HIM. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED IN CANADA. YOU KNOW, IT'S EQUAL, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. THIS IS A DIVERSE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD BE A DIVERSE WORLD. IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, YOU KNOW ? LET THEM, LET THEM, THEY DON'T HURT US. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. NO, I'M NOT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS MY WIFE. SURE. ( woman ) THE SUPPORT OF THE STRAIGHT COMMUNITY, I THINK, IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS AN ISSUE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IT'S NOT A LIFESTYLE ISSUE, IT'S A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN AMERICA YET, BUT I'LL BE THERE. ( reporter ) WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY THIS HOUR WITH BREAKING NEWS OUT OF MASSACHUSETTS. THE STATE SUPREME COURT JUDICIAL COURT HAS RULED TODAY THAT IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES TO BE DENIED THE BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE. IT'S A VERY BIG DAY. THIS IS A VERY, VERY BIG DAY. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A HISTORIC DAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2003. AND IT'S A HISTORIC DAY BECAUSE FINALLY ALL FAMILIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE EQUAL FAMILIES UNDER THE LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MOSTLY, THANK YOU TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS FOR SEEING WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE, WHICH IS THAT WE ARE A COUPLE THAT IS WORTHY OF THE PROTECTIONS OF MARRIAGE. AND THAT AFTER 16 AND A HALF YEARS, HILLARY AND I ARE FINALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED AND PROTECT OUR FAMILY. (crowd chanting) LET THE PEOPLE VOTE. REPENT, REPENT, GOD LOVES YOU. WHAT THE COURT IS ABOUT TO DO IS UNLEASH CHAOS ON OUR SOCIETY. AS YOU NOTICE, ROB IS ON CRUTCHES. HE'S JUST HAD A HIP REPLACEMENT SURGERY AND WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY AGAIN ABOUT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL NEGOTIATING OUR WAY THROUGH ADMINISTRATION, HOSPITAL TEAMS, AND FINALLY, RECOVERY, BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT EACH OTHER THROUGH MARRIAGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( crowd singing ) GOD BLESS AMERICA, MY HOME SWEET HOME. CIVIL RIGHTS. WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED. CIVIL RIGHTS... OUR OPPONENTS HAVE BUSSED PEOPLE IN. FROM GEORGIA, FROM VIRGINIA, MOST OF THEM ARE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW SAYING VERY NASTY, VICIOUS, HATEFUL THINGS ABOUT US. ( man ) WICKED SODOMITES, READS ROMAN'S CHAPTER 1. IT'S AN ABOMINATION UNDER GOD. CREATED YOU MALE AND FEMALE, THE BIBLE SAYS. MALE AND FEMALE. NOT HOMOSEXUAL, NOT BISEXUAL, NOT ANYTHING BUT HETEROSEXUAL. BUT YOU HETEROPHOBES DON'T LIKE THAT, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN. I'M STRAIGHT, WE'RE BOTH STRAIGHT ! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS WORLD IF WE DON'T GET OVER STUPID STUFF LIKE THIS. YOU MAY NOT BE SODOMITES, BUT YOU'RE HOMOPHILES. ( child ) HOMO'S GO TO GO! ARE THESE CHRISTIAN VALUES YOU'RE TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN ? HOMOS GOTTA GO ! YES, THEY ARE TEACHING ME, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY'RE RIGHT. HEY, HEY, HO, HO, HOMOS GOTTA GO ! I AGREE WITH 3,000 YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY. I DISAGREE WITH THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS. MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. I WILL SUPPORT AN AMENDMENT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTION TO MAKE THAT EXPRESSLY CLEAR. EQUAL RIGHTS ! WHEN DO WE WANT IT ? NOW ! WHAT DO WE WANT ? EQUAL RIGHTS ! GOD LOVES A SINNER, HE HATES SIN ! HE'S GOING TO TAKE THESE ANUS FUDGE-PACKING SODOMITES, HE'S GOING TO CAST THEM INTO HELL WHEN THEIR ANUSES ARE RIDDEN WITH BLOOD AND THEY GOT TO WEAR DIAPERS. HI, I'M GLORIA BAILEY AND THIS IS MY PARTNER OF 32 YEARS, LINDA DAVIES, AND, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY IN OUR LIVES. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR US IS KNOWING WHATEVER COMES AHEAD IN THE REST OF OUR LIVES, WE NOW KNOW WE CAN BE AT EACH OTHERS' SIDE. IF JUDGES INSIST ON FORCING THEIR ARBITRARY WILL UPON THE PEOPLE, THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE LEFT TO THE PEOPLE WOULD BE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. ( man ) THE TRUTH IS THE REPUBLICANS ARE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE WHEN THEY COMMIT TO RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY'RE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE LOTS OF SEX WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE. WHAT DO THEY WANT US TO DO? BASICALLY, THEY WANT US TO CEASE TO EXIST. AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO RE-WRITE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES TO TELL US WE CAN'T AND SHOULD HAVE SUPPORT IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS. SENATOR KERRY IN WASHINGTON D.C., IT IS IN YOUR STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT GAY MARRIAGES. SENATOR KERRY'S BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP ON THE ISSUE OF GAY MARRIAGE. HE OPPOSES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, BUT HE SUPPORTS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS, BUT A VERY LIMITED ONE. ONE THAT WOULD DEFINE MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, BUT WOULD AT THE SAME TIME SECURE CIVIL UNIONS. I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE CLEAR WHERE WE STAND WITH RESPECT TO EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NOT DISCRIMINATION. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE PROTECT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS EVEN AS I AND OTHERS ARE OPPOSED TO GAY MARRIAGE ITSELF. IT'S DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE THEIR OPPOSITION TO GAY MARRIAGE WITH THEIR FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT TO EQUAL RIGHTS. AND ONCE PEOPLE COME AND THEY ARE CRITICAL ABOUT IT, THEY'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T RATIONAL ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO GAY MARRIAGE. THOUSANDS OF GAY WEDDINGS HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE SENT SHOCKWAVES ACROSS THE NATION I THINK WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF SOME SORT OF A REVOLUTION, SOME SORT OF FLOOD THAT IS JUST HAPPENING, AND IT'S HAPPENING ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AWESOME. EXCELLENT. ( singing ) WE PAY TAXES LIKE EVERY BODY ELSE. YOU KNOW, WHY NOT ? WE JUST GOT A MARRIAGE LICENSE. YES, WE DID, AND WE'RE SO EXCITED. WE DECIDED FOR THE 29TH ANNIVERSARY WE'D ACTUALLY GET MARRIED. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED ! MY MOM'S HERE. HER MOM'S HERE. MOM'S HERE. ( cheering ) ( reporter ) IN GEORGIA TODAY, A SENATE COMMITTEE OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED A PLAN FOR AMENDING THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO BAN MARRIAGE FOR GAY COUPLES. IN NEW MEXICO, ABOUT 20 GAY COUPLES WERE MARRIED TODAY. IN MICHIGAN, SENATOR ALAN CROPSEY SAYS STATES MUST AMEND THEIR CONSTITUTIONS TO PREVENT THEIR JUDGES FROM DOING WHAT HAPPENED IN MASSACHUSETTS. LEGISLATURES IN NEARLY 20 STATES BESIDES MASSACHUSETTS ARE NOW CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS TO BAN MARRIAGE FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES. OPPONENTS OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TOOK TO THE STREETS OF BOSTON TODAY. ( crowd chanting ) LET THE PEOPLE VOTE. LET THE PEOPLE VOTE. ( woman ) THE MAYOR OF NEW PALTZ, WHO PERFORMED MORE THAN TWO DOZEN MARRIAGES LAST WEEK, WILL BE IN COURT TONIGHT FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES. THIS CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE IS REALLY SWEEPING ACROSS AMERICA ALL THE WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO NEW PALTZ, NEW YORK AND NOW MAKING ITS WAY RIGHT HERE TO NEW YORK CITY. ( crowd chanting ) WHAT DO WE WANT? CIVIL RIGHTS. WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW. WHAT DO WE WANT? CIVIL RIGHTS. WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW. WE GOT TURNED DOWN TODAY. ( man ) YOU GOT TURNED DOWN? YES, WE DID. ( man ) ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK? WE'LL BE BACK. DEFINITELY. HEY, WE'RE GOING TO THE END, REGARDLESS. WE'RE GOING UNTIL WE GET THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED FOR CHANGE. EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER THEN, SO... WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. IT'S JUST A SLOW PROCESS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. OVER THIS WAY PLEASE, THANK YOU. AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN HERE IN HIS IMAGE, WALKING HIS CREATION, THERE HAVE BEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR EXPRESSION OF LOVE WITH ANOTHER OF THE SAME GENDER. IT IS HIGH TIME WE PUT AN END TO THE QUEER NOTION THAT IT IS SINFUL TO BE GAY OR FOR GAYS TO COME TOGETHER TO BE MARRIED. &quot;MAY THE LORD BLESS US IN WISDOM &quot;THAT WE MAY GROW TOGETHER EVER IN LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING.&quot; WITH THIS RING... WITH THIS RING... I THEE WED... I THEE WED... MY BELOVED... MY BELOVED... MY BEST FRIEND. MY BEST FRIEND. ( woman ) MY SON BEING GAY, IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. I LOOKED AT HIM AS A PERSON. I STILL LOOK AT HIM AS A PERSON, NOT A GAY PERSON, NOT A STRAIGHT PERSON. I JUST LOOK AT HIM AS A PERSON. WE BOTH WERE CRYING, BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE IT, THE TEARS WERE FREEZING UP HALFWAY DOWN. I'VE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, THEY FEEL DIFFERENT, THEY FEEL CLOSER AFTERWARD, AND IT'S WONDERFUL, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. ♪ WE WAITED TOO DAMN LONG FOR OUR RIGHTS ♪ ♪ WE WAITED TOO DAMN LONG FOR OUR RIGHTS ♪ ♪ WE WAITED TOO DAMN LONG FOR OUR RIGHTS ♪ ♪ ALL TOGETHER NOW ♪ ♪ WE'RE GONNA LOVE THE WAY WE WANT TO ♪ ♪ RIGHT ON ♪ ♪ WE'RE GONNA LOVE THE WAY WE WANT TO ♪ ♪ RIGHT ON ♪ ♪ WE'RE GONNA LOVE THE WAY WE WANT TO ♪ ♪ RIGHT ON ♪ ♪ ALL TOGETHER NOW ♪ ♪ AND MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTERS ♪ ♪ TOO DAMN LONG ♪ ♪ AND MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTERS ♪ ♪ TOO DAMN LONG ♪ ♪ AND MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTERS ♪ ♪ TOO DAMN LONG ♪ ♪ ALL TOGETHER NOW ♪
