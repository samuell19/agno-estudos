Superfilm AG presents the musical burlesque The Gentleman Who Can Be Booked Festive Speaker for weddings, baptisms, engagement parties, consecrations of flags, jubilees, funerals and similar occasions Give me your card - I'll make a house call Carry Klips - Hallenstr. 4 # At baptisms, weddings and other festivities # one usually makes a festive speech. # Unfortunately what is lacking most of the time are the talents # who could make such speeches. # Therefore one invites, apart from the other guests # also the festive speaker to such festivities. # I'll make the required speech for everyone # who gets engaged, married, or gives a lecture # Give me your card, I'll make a house call # I am the man who can do anything, don't begin anything without me # Give me your card, I'll make a house call # I am the man who fixes anything in an exemplary manner # If you need my humble talents # I'm ready, any time. # Whatever you want I'll keep it rolling clay or night, it'll be clone. # Give me your card, I'll make a house call. # I am the man who can do anything, don't begin anything without me # Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me. But the advertisement must be taken off. Nobody must know that the festive speaker isn't of the family. Distillation Coffee Tea Sandwiches Beer Carry Klips. # Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagements, # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with or without piano accompaniment. # Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me. What about the little Miss? But you ordered the wedding speech with piano accompaniment. That's right. The lady is the piano accompaniment. Excellent. Right now they're in the right mood for a beautiful speech. If I may ask for a few personal details first. The bridegroom: Little Franz Krug, 20 years, not a blemish on his record so far. The bride: my daughter, little Marie, about 41 years. A marriage of love or of convenience? A loving marriage of convenience. How long has the bridal couple known each other? Six weeks. How many children? - I beg your pardon? - That's enough. Another question: How shall I introduce you, Herr Klips? Not at all. The bride's family should think I'm from the bridegroom's side, and the others that I'm from the bride's side. Dear co-eaters: [Mit-Esser, meaning also "pimples"] I have been honoured with the pleasure of making the festive speech. I avail myself of this pleasure by welcoming you all. You all have come to watch the young couple's happiness, because you'll never again see them as happy as they are today. Because what'll follow after this beautiful feast isn't beautiful, but "feisty". [fest = 1. feast 2. stable, steady] Because I mean, marriage. Because the most beautiful thing about marriage is the wedding, and this wedding party is a special wedding party.[Hoch-zeit = high time] Because it was high time that the thing became steady. [fest] Because, look at the dear bride, our beloved little Marie. She saw many springs till at last beloved Franz came along. Poor Franz! Poor, because he only met his little Marie so late in life. We know, dear Franz, what awaits you now... But we don't envy you, no, we're happy you've got your little Marie. And now the dear parents! Little Marie's parents, they mustn't be forgotten, who spared neither efforts nor money to get rid of their daughter ["los-werden"] Eh, to embellish their daughter's fate ["Los"] on earth. And now she's got her Franz, and Franz may be calm now. Nobody will take her away from him. And so I'll raise this cup of joy at this feast of joy in this house of joy. [Freuden-Haus : brothel] May the young couple celebrate very soon their golden wedding and always bear the patriotic poet's lines in mind: # Marriage is no great evil, # one paints the yoke of marriage in far too black colours. # Marriage is like an onion: # one cries over it but swallows it all the same. The young couple, long may they live, high! High - high - high! Come along. The baptism is without piano accompaniment. Ah yes. Don't forget, you're the Deputy Upper Ministerial Official von Zickendorf! Upper Zickendorfer Mineral Special... Upper Zickendorfer Specialist for... Mineral Deputy of... Upper Deputy Mineral... Upper Official... Upper Zickendorfer Special Mineral Upper Deputy... One moment, come with me! Oh dear. Come along. - Please, speak on the telephone! - I? Yes, I'll tell you what to say. Hello, this is the Deputy Upper Ministrant of Upper-Zicke What, a Zicke [goat]? Which Zicke? No, you're Professor Wielander! But I'm not a Professor! Ah, Professor. No, this is Dr. Cajetan, General Secretary of the "Modern Club". I am happy to have finally reached the Professor in person. No, I'm speaking on behalf of our esteemed president, the Baroness Lindenw?rth. I have the honourable task of informing you that the committee has awarded this year's first prize to your book. I'm getting a prize! Marvellous! - How much is the prize? - For God's sake! The club's prize is of course purely idealistic. [idealer] How many thalers? I see, idealistic. But that's very little. - What does he say? - He doesn't want to pay. Dear Professor, that I finally got hold of the eternally invisible man. Now there's a lady speaking. May the ladies of the club ask of you to present us with the honour... A present? But that's insolent! The prize doesn't earn me anything, and l am to make them a present as well! Hello, Madame General! Madame Baron! Stop it, stop it! We've been cut off. Didn't you understand what the lady wanted? Not a word. But we can call them back. - No no, thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. I don't want to keep you any longer, Herr...eh... Carry Klips. # Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagement parties # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with our without piano accompaniment. # Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me. What? You're a professional speaker? I take the liberty. May I ask for the meaning of this telephone call? Oh, that was... a little joke. A little joke, very well. If you ever need me again for a joke - my address! #Take my card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me. The Deputy Upper Ministerial Official von Zickendorf will honour us with his visit, on the occasion of our little daughter's baptism. Allow me, von Zickendorf. Madame. Herr Henkelmann. Esteemed... Esteemed guests, present or absent, dear parents, dear young man! Man, that's a girl! Pardon. Esteemed young Miss! I have been awarded the rare honour to hold the festive speech at this feast, the festive speech for our little baptizee. Because the world is beautiful, wonderfully beautiful. Let us remember the day when we first saw the light of the bedside table lamp in mother's bedroom. We all were younger then, more carefree, not so dry, not so... We all were younger then, more carefree, not so sober, not so dry as we are today. But more like you, you little baptizee. Well yes... that's what I was going to say, not so... not so dry, but rather... jolly, I'd even say... "wet"-jolly, [feucht-fr?hlich" - boozy] Just like this little child in white linen. What joys such a small child will bring home in later years, that I cannot describe in so many words and that's why I end my speech with a vivat for the little drunkard [S?ufling] For the little baptizee. [T?ufling] High high high! Hurry up! What's next? Consecration of the flag with the boy scouts. Ah yes, of course. # Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # I am the man who can do anything, don't begin without me # Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me. It won't last forever, that lousy speaking at feasts. A few hundred more of those weddings and baptisms like those today... And we can become engaged. What about the baptism? What's going on here? The door's open. But I'm positive I locked it. - Evening. - Evening. The doorman was as kind as to let me wait here, because I absolutely had to speak to you today. Really? Am I to make another phone call? May I speak to you alone? Lillebil... If you please. How did you get into this uniform? I held the festive speech for the firemen brigade's memorial service. I see. I've made you participate in a little fraud today. I am still at your disposition. Professor Wielander, whom you've impersonated, is my boss, you know. I'm his secretary. And surely you must have heard of him. Emanuel Wielander! Cyclists Club "Puncture" I don't know any Emanuel. But you must know his book, his famous book on marriage which was crowned with a prize today. Why crowned? He won't get a crown [penny] for the prize. Oh! Wrestlers Club "Jump On Him" Oh, that's not interesting. - Listen to me. - With pleasure. The condition is that each prize holder must make a big speech in public. What have I got to do with this? You must make the speech for him. - I? - Yes. Why doesn't he make the speech himself? Because he can't. Is he dumb? Worse. He has a speech impediment, that's the trouble. Dumb would be interesting, but a famous writer with a speech impediment is ridiculous. So, what's the problem exactly? He has a lisp, and he stammers a bit, gets stuck with his tongue, has breathing problems when speaking, suffers from loss of memory, attacks of anxiety, he gets hoarse, and he spatters on top of it. But otherwise he's fine? - Yes, thank God. - That's good to hear. See, nobody knows about his speech impediment. So far, he's lived quite a solitary life. But now he's to be introduced to high society. And I'm to speak for him? Yes, his inaugural speech in public. But how shall I do that? Listen. His lecture in the "Modern Club" is scheduled for next week... MODERN CLUB TODAY: LECTURE Prof. E. WIELANDER # We are the audience, the great audience # we demand gaudium for our money # because honour, value, and fame is awarded by the audience # it all depends on whether we like it or not. # We bend forward and sit cold and silent # a great audience in a big house # So jump to the beat of the music, show your mumbo-jumbo # because the audience has requested it. Ladies and gentlemen! My God, if only everything eh... works out all right, I feel so... terr...ibly worried. Whether it'll be all right about the speech. It'll work out fine. The festive speaker will see to it. Will he? And you know, I can so beautifully... make a speech, so enrapturing, so... so... so... fascinating, if nobody's listening. Unfortunately you cannot talk in monologue all your life. Unfortunately. And now I have the honour to introduce to you the author of the book "Marriage", Professor Wielander. It's the first time the prize-winning author is speaking in public. Like this! I beg your pardon, but it's all been arranged as you wished. Nobody may enter the space behind the stage. Esteemed audience, esteemed Madame President! The topic has the title "Marriage and its prevention". An old Arabian proverb says: marriage is like a town under siege. Those outside want to get in, those inside want to get out. In fact, this sums up pretty much everything one could say about marriage. Because, esteemed ladies and gentlemen, marriage is nothing else but a terrible misunderstanding. Most marriages are made in the belief that happiness begins with marriage, whereas nothing else begins but a terrible misunderstanding. But this is the voice of... In fact, each marriage is on the one hand a res consuetudinis, on the other hand a res unius quis.... damned... unius quisque. Which means, it may be regarded biologically or sociologically. And since it is a co... copulatio damned... fortunae aquae vitae of wife and husband, one must look at it from two sides. That is, on the one hand, from the status virilis, on the other hand, from the status mulibris. Muliebris. Muliebris. Already in paradise, Adam and Eve... Radio Germany K?nigs Wusterhausen at 7 p.m.: transmission from the "Moderner Klub" lecture: Prof. Emanuel Wielander Man and woman and the whole world... Esteemed listeners, because now the matter gets ticklish, all the questionis matrimoni are of an altitudo cuius est magna auctoritas. Rabridrana... Rabridranath Tragore... Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian scholar, has already remarked: [now in fancy Bengali] krihis hastopi... cria iucto nagriena drihas rami naki nakliva nakliva putra nakaliva ava khan pari baldis pari baida dam dalma daiva kayyam dakalusta fe hasmi hasmi Bless you! I proceed: hasmineva prejunianus himamineva tujate Exactly my opinion! I gather you've understood me correctly, ladies and gentlemen, each marriage is nothing but an egocentric necessitas summae potestates... in alias. But this egotism is a valitudo minus commoda and as long as... this autocratic egotism secrotantly exists at all, there is no possibility for a good marriage. Sit! Sit! Which phenomenon suddenly appears then, ladies and gentlemen? Ladies and Gentlemen... Where on earth do you come from? Sonja, quiet! ...has its foundation on mutual... Get into the corner! Which after mutual help... Will you go into the corner! Silent! Will you sit still! The vita maccaroni must be a school of the caritas hominum... Look here, the little kitten! We have happily taken care of this passus now. Sonja, come here! And thus I close my statement: everything is destiny, marriages are made in heaven, that's why, as Nestroy remarks, a heavenly patience is needed to be able to bear them on earth. My dear Professor, it has been enrapturing. I thank you on behalf of the club, and especially on behalf of myself. Of course we must get acquainted more closely. But certainly, as close as possible. You must come and see me. I'd be delighted to welcome you as my guest. I'm afraid that's impossible, Baroness. But it's very possible! You see. But... Agreed, Professor. May I count on your visit? Of course, Madame, we'll come and we'll be overjoyed. So goodbye then, tomorrow at my place! Well, thank you again for the enjoyable evening. Isn't she delightful! You insolent person! How dare you accept the invitation! Listen to me, when a nice woman invites me to coffee I never say no. You don't have a say in anything! All at once? Till now you needed me, but not when I'm invited for coffee Anyway... - You're not invited. - Why not? - Only the professor. - That's the same, the professor and I. What do you say to that, Professor? What do you say to that, Professor? The mic mic... The whole world may hear it for all I care! I don't like it that you go and see that Baroness. I... eh... Come with me! In any case, your services are no longer required, Mr. Festive Speaker. Well, Madame Baroness, what about the two of us? What was that? What were you saying? You're afraid of me? # Already Madame Eve said to her husband # Dear Adam, get started! # I'm already sick and tired of paradise so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me! # And Paris with the tunic # said to his beautiful Helen: # Your Menelaus is sitting at home, so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me! # To beautiful Romeo, little Juliet sends all her love longings # and K?the has long ago come to an agreement with her Karlheinz. # Don't be afraid of the first kiss # because it's bound to happen one day. # Don't be afraid, I'd love to teach you, # kissing is again quite fashionable nowadays. # Nobody needs to know anything about it, except the two of us, # don't be afraid when it happens, there's nothing to it. # You'd better be afraid of the last kiss # because it's bound to happen, too. The transmission of Prof. Wielander's lecture was a splendid success. After the lecture, the scholar sang a little song which had nothing to do with the theme of marriage, but which will surely be a smash hit very soon. Tell me, did you listen to the radio last night? Yes, some learned rubbish about marriage. So so... By the way, Mother has been writing to me again. She asks when the two of us will finally get married. It's high time, she says. My dear child, one mustn't rush into a marriage. It's a far too important matter, so to speak, a res consuetudinis, on the one hand on the other hand, a res us unius quisque. That is, it may be looked at from two sides, either sociologically, or biologically. You see, this is what mother says, too. It's logical for the two of us to get married, since for such a long time we've been... Your eternal talk about your mother! # Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night. # That two people kiss each other without wedding rings, # today, mother cannot understand it anymore. # In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone, # darkness favours secret dealings, # by the light of the gas lantern. # Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night. # Almost all men shudder when one speaks of marriage # they have hardly heard one word of it and they are gone forever. # Men are criminals # and are getting cheekier every day. # They have no conscience at all, all they say is: # Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night. # That two people kiss each other without wedding rings # today, mother cannot understand it anymore. # In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone, # darkness favours secret dealings, # by the light of the gas lantern. # Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night. And the Professor must sit next to me. Then I'll have him all to myself. Yes, Madame Baroness. I'm totally overworked. And Miss Titi? Oh, that meddlesome person! Place her right at the end of the table. Yes, Madame Baroness. Prof. Wielander on the phone! Dear Professor, how kind of you to call me. What are you saying? You've dreamt about the dress I'll be wearing? Well? What? A gown with silver lace? In my hair a diadem? How did you guess this? How l know about it? I'm a psychic. But that's not why I'm calling you, but to hear once more your beloved voice, Madame Baroness. For who knows when and if at all we'll ever see each other again. But why? But we'll be seeing each other tonight. Unfortunately I cannot come, no. Oh, yes, yes... I'm coming! Of course! I'm already there! I'm looking forward to seeing you, dear Professor. But Professor, how did you manage to be here already? And you've really predicted my gown? Or have you bribed my dressmaker, you you... Excuse me. But we can still turn back and leave. No! As you please, let's stay then. But what will the beautiful baroness say when she hears how you really speak? That'll be just great! Today you belong to me, you must tell me everything, Professor. Oh dear! Come with me. Oh dear! Ladies and Gentlemen! We have the great honour to greet Herr Wielander, who until now has never been seen in society, as our guest. Oh dear. Esteemed hostess, honoured guests! If the servant annoys you during your speech, I'll send him away. No! We're sitting at a rich table, and we've been invited by a beautiful woman. But... we'd still be sitting in paradise today if God hadn't told Eve: "I forbid you to eat apples from the tree of knowledge". But if He had told her instead "I think eating apples doesn't become you, Eve", and since this little faux-pas made by a beautiful woman, eating became fashionable, and since beautiful women always follow fashion they see to it that we'll always sit at rich tables. Already the immortal Brillat-Savarin knew it: "Tell me what you eat, and I tell you who you are". I look around in this company and I see a classical table service, heavenly dishes, refined food. And I know who our host is: a classical, heavenly, refinedly beautiful woman. Prosit! Prosit, Professor. Prosit. You're not only a great scholar, but also a great Casanova. Yes. Come with me, Professor, let's have a quiet chat. Oh dear. Take a seat. We're alone here. Isn't it nice here? Are you looking for something? I see, help yourself. Do you know what I like best about you? Your voice. Hoppla. You have such a melodious... I'd even say... erotic voice. Say something, Professor. Speak to me now! I think it's adorable of you: only when you speak of your work you get carried away, otherwise you like to keep silent, like all great men. But now you must tell me what's on your mind. I know, you want to tell me something, isn't that so, Professor? I want to know whether you can make a woman happy. I say! and how! Right from the first moment I thought... What did you think? Golly! I thought. She's my kind of woman. Oh dear I held the lecture only for you. I could sense it. I also noticed that you lost your composure each time you looked at me. But that wasn't because of you, it was because of the poodle. What poodle? I mean, pudelatio persilia... Because of the chapter on marriage. I see And you don't want to get married? But I do! Ouch! [Au] What was that? [Auf] If it were the case, only with a woman like you. Why me? Because you have charm, chic, esprit, money [Geld] Eh, a reputation [Gelt-ung] in the world. Oh dear. You seem so strange to me. When one looks at you one must love you dearly, but when you speak I feel afraid of you. #All beginnings are hard in life, # even more so in love. # so start practicing early, or else you'll never learn kissing, kissing, kissing # Young people, whether rich or poor, in love they're all alike, # at first happy, and then madly in love, love love. # That's why it's important to get it right in the beginning, # when one finally has a rendezvous then you say... # Don't be afraid of the first kiss # because it's bound to happen one day. # Don't be afraid, I love to teach you # kissing is quite fashionable nowadays. # Nobody's to know anything about it, just the two of us # only I'm afraid, perhaps something will happen to me while I'm doing it. # You'd better be afraid of the last kiss # because it's bound to happen one day, too. No, l! You! Ouch! I'm not afraid. How powerful you are, as if you held me with iron arms. Come with me, Professor, we must get back to the party. Oh dear. # It has been very beautiful, I've been so pleased # the guests have greatly amused themselves # The evening is over, I don't regret it # but it would have even been better without the guests. # The dinner was superb, the wines exquisite, # the ??? were cleaned and patient # The guests took the very best impression home, # and didn't give any tips! The Professor? What are you doing here? And you? I... I wanted... So do I. So we both want the same. Yes. You must make to the Baroness... from me a... a declaration of love, will you? And she should the... The key. Key, yes, thank you, throw down the key, and whether I can come up and have with her a... a... a cup of tea... yes? I am to tell her that? Yes, you're to tell her that, yes? But I don't want to have tea. Not you! I! Ah, you want to have tea. - Yes. - You're a fine gentleman. Having tea in the middle of the night. You must tell her... that I... love her. Yes? - I won't do it. - Why not? Because I like her myself. - You? - Yes. And? And now I'll go upstairs and tell her the truth. Oh dear! Hoppla! Not not... tell her... I'm fed up playing the tinpot Cyrano. Get your act together alone! All right, I'll get my eh... - Act... - Act together alone. Is there anything you want from me? Tea. But what is it you want, Professor? I just wanted to tell you that I never have tea. And that's why you've come back? Yes, that's why. I never have tea, neither with rum, nor lemon, nor cream, and I don't want to have tea, I don't want anything. I just want to have peace. Go to bed and dream about whomever you like, only not about me! That's unheard-of! What insolence! Good night and good riddance! You you ...dog! But you're crazy! Why are you shouting in the middle of the night? Why are you demolishing the garden facilities? None of your business. You look after your own inclinations. Inclinations? You! Don't shout at me, or I'll arrest you! Arrest me then, you grease drop ["grease-eye"] of the law! Grease drop? No, not eye. I! Nine-eyes? You're under arrest! # One falls in love here and there # and doesn't know how it happened. # Suddenly it begins, and you only notice # when you can't change it anymore. # And one stands in front of her house, # looks up to her windows, # and one sighs heavily and wanders up and down # in front of the window. # Your nightshirt is made of cr?pe de chine, # your heart is made of stone, # you've no idea how much I'm in love, # only I alone know about it. # If you only knew how nice I can be to women # then you wouldn't say no any longer, # then your heart would be made of crepe de chine # and not, like it is now, of stone. # Did you really say no? # Did you only say it without meaning it? # tell me, are you only shamming or are you making fun of me? # Yesterday you were blazing hot, # today you're as cold as ice, # sometimes quiet, sometimes passionate, # child, you're a riddle to me. # Your shirt is made of cr?pe de chine, # your heart is made of stone, # you've no idea how much I'm in love # only I alone know about it. # If you only knew how nice I can be to women, # then you wouldn't say no any longer, # then your heart would be made of cr?pe de chine # and not, like it is now, of stone. You know, Adam, such an elegant woman has her charms. Believe me, a cozy bedroom, a bed with silk cushions, and Madame in a shirt of cr?pe de chine. Well? What do you think? You know, I really like Lillebil a lot, but it's always the same. What do you think? Should I go to that baroness and tell her that I like her? Calm down. I didn't want to know that much You too would rather be a Rolls Royce with luxury body and triad horn. Or should I stay with Lillebil? What do you say? Of course, you two, Lillebil and you, you always stick together. Now it's enough, do you hear! Don't get excited! I'll stay with Lillebil. I'll even marry her, so that the mother doesn't complain anymore. But not right now. I'd like to stay a bachelor for a while. # Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night. Oh, the festive speaker! What else do you want from us? I behaved badly with the Professor yesterday. I'd like to make up for it today, and again... eh... make speeches for him. The Professor has a visitor, and he'll hardly have use for your services after that visitor. Because the baroness is with him. Alone with him? Indeed, all alone, and in a room without folding screens or curtains or Japanese armour. In a word: no hiding place for you. I got your letter, Professor. You wrote that you had to see me urgently. You were going to explain your behaviour last night. Oh dear. I have arranged it. In two minutes she'll learn that her adored Professor can't even speak. In three minutes she'll be gone. In four minutes, my Professor will belong to me again. I think this is an outrage! Betraying the poor Professor that way! Adieu, Mr. Festive Speaker, it has been festive. You remain silent because you're embarrassed. I must say, last night at my window you were much more talkative. Well? I'm listening, Professor. So formal? I'm quite curious. Well, what do you have to say to me? That I love you. Now this is a surprise! I didn't expect that! Me neith... er. You make me feel abashed. Now I'm stuck. So am I. I beg your pardon? Let's get comfortable now. Let's light the fireplace. Good Heavens, no! As you like. You were talking so nicely, go on. How am I to reconcile your declaration of love with last night's incident? Eh... eh... Baroness, don't think of last night. Only think of this hour, only this moment matters. I love you wickedly! [ver-rucht - Rauch = smoke] Baroness! - I love you... - Your voice is so fiery, so flaming. Yes, fiery and flaming, that is exactly how I feel. Don't you like the cognac? I think it's excellent. Oh dear. The way the wind howls in the chimney, and there's not even a breeze outside. But what do we care about that storm! What do we care about the whole world! Tell me what's on your heart. Baroness, Baroness, I have the honour to ask for your hand in marriage. If only I could get a grasp for my hand in here. Oh dear. Oh dear. But what on earth were you looking for in there? You'll laugh, I've been looking for this one. But how strange you speak! You have the same voice as the professor! Yes. In Heaven's name, tell me who you are! Carry Klips, # Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagement parties # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with our without piano accompaniment. # Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me. Pardon. And your voice? Was the professor's. And the professor? Has several effective speech impediments. - And you have... - Spoken for him. - And the declaration of love? - Was my own. - And the kiss? - Mine, too. Why? The "iron" embrace. Insolence! That's right. But then I've fallen in love with your voice! So it seems. Terrible! A festive speaker! You have... you have... Told her everything. - Told everything? - Yes. - Do you know what you are? - Well? You're a... a fraud! A crook, a robber, a murderer, a thief, a forger, a church robber. - But Professor! - What is it? So you can speak! - I can what? - Speak! Oh dear. Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mould of well-burnt clay. Go away, silly goose! Again. Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mould of well-burnt clay. Quick, now, workmen, be ye ready ! Forth must come the bell to-day ! Should the master praise be given ; Yet the blessing comes... from Heaven. One moment. One moment. Just one moment: Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mould of of clay... of well-burnt clay. Today... - You! It is I who's speaking! - Yes. - So I can speak again! - Yes. - I can speak fluently again! - Yes! - You're a... - I know, a fraud. No, no, no, no! You're an angel, a magician, a genius! # Two hearts in 3/4-time, # the May has united them, # two hearts in 3/4-time Madame Baroness. How dare you show yourself in here, you fraud! - Baroness! - You crook! You impostor! Baroness! You've let another man babble in your place. Baroness! You've let another man kiss me. Baroness! And you call this love? Baroness! You've tricked me into giving you my sympathy, but you can't even speak! Oh yes, I can speak! But they don't let me! - You can speak? - Yes, I can speak. I can speak like a filibuster, like a festive speaker, like a speaker at an election. One moment. One moment. What are you looking for? The festive speaker. But that's me, the festive speaker! # Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me. One moment. Say: Fisher's Fritze fishes fresh fish. Oh dear. Fisher's Fritze fishes fresh fish. - So you really can... - Speak. - Without the other man? - Without the other man. Thank God! Then we can get married. Oh dear. Why? Well, now you're finally able to speak up and say "yes". # Don't be afraid of the marriage license office, # because from here are issued some beautiful things. # Don't be afraid of the marriage license, # one day each man falls into the trap. # Please speak up and say "yes", #then you'll be soon a mama and you the papa. # Now she belongs to him and will remain his forever. # If you're fortunate she'll say "no". Madame Baroness von Lindenw?rth, are you determined, of your own free will to enter into matrimony with Herr Professor Emanuel Wielander? Then answer "yes". Yes. Yes. Herr Professor Emanuel Wielander, are you determined, of your own free will to enter into matrimony with Madame Baroness von Lindenw?rth? Then answer "yes". I'm asking you for the last time: answer with a loud and, if possible, articulate "yes". Will you really say "yes" when we stand before the marriage registrar? Yes. So I declare you man and wife. Or rather "no". Listen darling, we've gotten on so well up to now. But I've promised Mother that we'll get married at last. Oh, you and your mother... # Mother doesn't have to know about it # we'll get married another time, I promise. I know all about that other time, it's now or never! # That two kiss each other without wedding rings And I've got the rings, too. # that I cannot understand, alas You'll understand all right. # In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone And the marriage registrar in there! # darkness favours secret dealings, No more secret dealings now! Now we'll get married! # by the light of the gas lantern Gas or electric, day or night... # The whole world may know about it, # that I'm your spouse from today on.
