BOY! - YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. - MADAME VARCOLAC. OKAY, LOOK, I--I'M SORRY. I-I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO! MY SISTER'S IN TROUBLE! - I AM AWARE. - YOU ARE? - I KNOW WEREWOLF WHEN I SEE ONE. - YOU DO? DA. I LIVE WITH WEREWOLF MY ENTIRE LIFE. - "IN DEATH, ALL ANSWERS ARE REVEALED." - UNCLE DRAGOMIR WAS THE WOLFSBERG BEAST. - IS TRUE. DRAGOMIR WAS BRILLIANT INVENTOR AND SCIENTIST. - REALLY? - DA. HE INVENTED KARAOKE. - I LOVE KARAOKE. - WHO DOESN'T? HE WAS ALSO HUMANITARIAN. HE KNOW MOST PEOPLE CANNOT HANDLE WHAT COMES WITH BEING WEREWOLF. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - IT CAN BE LONELY, PAINFUL EXISTENCE-- FEEDING OFF EARTH'S CREATURES, SLAVE TO FULL MOON. FOR SOME, LIKE YOUR SISTER, WHO HAD IT THRUST UPON THEM, THEY COULD SUFFER GREATLY IF MADE TO LIVE IN THIS WAY FOR ALL ETERNITY. - PLUS, I'D NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT. - IS WHY DRAGOMIR CREATE WAY TO REVERSE EFFECTS. - HE DID? - DA. HE WANTED GIVE PEOPLE CHOICE. - AWESOME. WHERE IS IT? - I HAVE NO IDEA. - UNCLE DRAGOMIR, HELP ME. TELL ME WHAT TO DO. - HEY. - HEY, IT'S ME. I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING. - I DON'T GET IT. WHY WOULD UNCLE DRAGOMIR HIDE SOMETHIN' THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE? - BECAUSE IN WRONG HANDS, IT CAN BE USED AS WEAPON TO HURT OTHERS. - WELL, LIKE, HURT WHO? - THOSE LIKE DRAGOMIR-- THOSE WHO MUST REMAIN WEREWOLF. - WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE? - IS OKAY. I'M COOL. - SHE IS. UNCLE DRAGOMIR WAS THE WOLFSBERG BEAST! I-I TOLD YOU! IT'S ALL REAL. - YEAH, I KIND OF FIGURED THAT. - WHERE IS WRITING? - RIGHT THERE. - WHERE? - RIGHT THERE. - YOU WILL HAVE TO READ. LEFT OCHELARI-- GLASSES--AT CASTLE. "A INVERSA BLESTEMUL" - "TO REVERSE THE CURSE." WHAT ARE INGREDIENTS? UH, "ANIMA DE MARMOTA." - MARMOT HEART. "LARVA DE VISPE." LARVA... VISPE. - WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER? - THEY ARE COMING. - THEY? WHO'S THEY? VAMPIRES. - WAMPIRES? - WAMPIRES. - WAMPIRES? - WAMPIRES! VAMPIRES. DA. THEY ARE PURE EVIL. THERE WAS TIME WHEN THEY ROSE TO POWER AND WERE CLOSE TO RULING THE EARTH. IT WAS DARKEST TIME IN OUR HISTORY. YOUR UNCLE DRAGOMIR AND WEREWOLVES LIKE HIM WERE CALLED UPON TO DELIVER ALL BEINGS FROM THIS DARKNESS. - SO WEREWOLVES ARE GOOD? - OF COURSE THEY ARE. 1,000 YEARS AGO, FIERCE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT WHERE WOLFSBERG MANOR NOW STANDS. VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES FOUGHT TO DEATH. THOUSANDS ON EACH SIDE WERE LOST, BUT WEREWOLVES PREVAILED. THIS BECOMES SACRED LAND. THE VUKOVICS BECOME THE GREAT PROTECTORS. NOW DRAGOMIR IS GONE. WITHOUT BLOODLINE WEREWOLF TO PROTECT THE SACRED LAND, THE VAMPIRES WILL TRY AGAIN TO GAIN CONTROL. IF THEY DO, IT WILL BE SIGNAL FOR THEM TO RISE UP AND FEED UPON HUMAN RACE. NO ONE WILL BE SAFE. THIS WILL BECOME A WORLD RULED BY THE UNDEAD! - MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL DAD? - WHAT ABOUT ME? I CAN PROTECT THE CASTLE. - NO. MUST BE BLOODLINE WEREWOLF. WHAT IS MATTER, BOY? - WHOA, WHAT'S WRONG? JUST GOT A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED, BUT I-I'M OKAY. - WE MUST HURRY. FINISH LIST. - WH-WHAT ABOUT THE CASTLE? - FIRST WE HELP GIRL. THEN WE SAVE UNDERWORLD. - HORNET GLOVES, WE HAVE. SCORPION TAIL. DA--NO. WAIT. WE HAVE. WE HAVE BAT SALIVA-- - I HAVE. - NO KIDDING. - HEART OF MARMOT, WE HAVE. - DA. - WHAT'S A MARMOT? - IS BIG SQUIRREL. ROADKILL. MM. - DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. - UH, THERE IS ONE INGREDIENT HERE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. L.B. 217? - GOT IT COVERED. - MAY I ASK WHAT YOU'RE MAKING? - WOLFSBERG JAMBALAYA. HAS REAL KICK. MMM! - EXCUSE ME, BOY. - ? OH, BABY, BABY ? ? ? ? OH, BABY ? HELLO? DA, MR. SANDS. I AM WITH CHILDREN. I WILL TELL THEM. OH, LA REVEDERE. THAT WAS YOUR FATHER. TONIGHT HE IS DINING AT VELVET CAPE. - WAS THAT A BRITNEY SPEARS RINGTONE? DA. SHE'S WEREWOLF, YOU KNOW. - WOW. THAT EXPLAINS A LOT. - IS EVERYTHING OKAY? - SURE. - GORAN, YOU'VE BEEN REALLY QUIET. I KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG. - JORDAN, I AM CONFUSED. WHEN WE FIRST MET, YOU WERE VERY DIFFERENT, SO SHY AND AWKWARD AND SO SWEET. - I KNOW. IT'S BEEN A REALLY, REALLY WEIRD WEEK FOR ME. I'M NOT THE SAME GIRL. - BUT I LIKE THAT GIRL. SHE MADE ME LAUGH. SHE STOLE MY HEART... BUT NOW? NOW I AM STARTING TO FEEL LIKE PIECE OF MEAT. - NO. NO, GORAN, YOU'RE NOT. IT'S JUST-- I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH SOME CHANGES, CHANGES THAT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND, THAT-THAT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. IS SOMETHING THE MATTER? - UH, NO. NO, IT'S, UM-- IT'S GETTING CHILLY. UH, WE HAVE TO GO. - MADAME V. - OH. WE MUST GET GIRL TO CASTLE. NO ONE MUST SEE HER. - AREN'T WE ALL OUT OF L.B. 217? - DA. - WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? - WE WILL IMPROVISE, BUT NOW YOU MUST GO. GET TAXI. I WILL FINISH, AND I WILL MEET YOU THERE. - OKAY. - GO, GO, GO, GO. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! - WHERE ARE WE GONNA FIND A CAB? - I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. WE JUST--WE JUST NEED TO KEEP LOOKING. WHAT? WE HAVE GOT TO STOP RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER LIKE THIS. THIS IS CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU KIDS DOING? - WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO WOLFSBERG MANOR. - HOW LUCKY ARE WE? I'M ACTUALLY ON MY WAY TO PICK UP YOUR FATHER RIGHT NOW. YOU KIDS WANT A RIDE? - YEAH. - YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT. - GREAT. WOLFSBERG IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. DON'T YOU THINK? SURE YOU DO. WELL, THEN AGAIN, I AM A NIGHT OWL. GUILTY. HOW ABOUT YOU ALL? - I'M NOT, BUT SHE IS. - YOU OKAY OVER THERE, HON-BUN? - YES. I MEAN, I'M FINE. YOU KNOW, JORDAN, I'VE NOTICED A CHANGE IN YOU SINCE YOU'VE GOT TO OUR SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE YOU FOUND SOME KIND OF INNER STRENGTH OR SOMETHING, WHICH I, FOR ONE, THINK IS SO COMPLETELY FABULOUS. HOPE I'M NOT OFF BASE ON ANY OF THIS. GOSH KNOWS I'M ALL ABOUT THAT GIRL POWER. - HERE. - OH. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - OH, SWEETIE, I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST DIED. OKAY, NO BIGGIE. EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. I'M JUST GOING TO JIGGLE THE LITTLE DOOHICKEY AND... WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY. TWO SHAKES. - I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT MUCH LONGER. - YOU GOT TO HOLD IT IN. - I'M TRYING! IT'S NOT LIKE GOING TO THE BATHROOM, HUNTER. - WHAT WAS THAT? - ALL SET. - PAULINA, NOT TO FREAK YOU OUT OR ANYTHING, BUT THERE IS BUNCH OF VAMPIRES BEHIND YOU. OH, SWEETIE. OF COURSE THERE ARE! OH! - YOU'RE LATE! I'VE GOT DINNER PLANS. GET THESE TWO BOBBLEHEADS OUT OF HERE. I'LL DEAL WITH THEM... ONCE WOLFSBERG MANOR IS OURS. - YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET THE CASTLE, PAULINA! - "YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THE CASTLE, PAULINA!" OH, IT'S FUNNY. YOUR UNCLE DRAGOMIR SAID THE EXACT SAME THING RIGHT BEFORE I KI--OOPS. WELL, YOU KNOW. OKAY. TOODLES. - GREAT. NO SERVICE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? - WHEN THEY OPEN THE TRUNK, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT. - WHAT ABOUT YOU? I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU HERE. - DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I CAN HANDLE MYSELF. JUST GO FIND DAD AND WARN HIM. IT'LL BE OKAY, HUNTER. I PROMISE. - LEAVE HIM! HE MEANS NOTHING! - MADAME V! MADAME V! MADAME V! WAIT! - YOU. IT WAS YOU THE WHOLE TIME. - SURPRISE! - WELL, YOU ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNER OF A THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD ROMANIAN CASTLE, ALTHOUGH, I HAVE TO SAY YOU SEEM MORE LIKE THE ENGLISH COTTAGE TYPE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. SORRY, I'M JUST A LITTLE EMOTIONAL. I NEVER THOUGHT WOLFSBERG MANOR WOULD ACTUALLY BE MINE. - WELL, I'M GLAD IT'S IN GOOD HANDS, YOU KNOW? IT-IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT'S STILL IN THE FAMILY. - YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG WE'VE WAITED FOR THIS. - WE? - I--ME. IT'S THE ROYAL WE. WHEE! OH. DAD, DON'T DO IT! - OH, HUNTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHERE'S MY SISTER? - HUNTER, WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU? - WHERE'D YOU TAKE HER? - PUNKIN', ARE YOU FEELIN' OKAY? 'CAUSE YOU LOOK A LITTLE PALE. - NO! YOU'RE ONE TO TALK! - ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT EVEN REMOTELY FUNNY. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ISN'T FUNNY? SHE IS A VAMPIRE! I'M TELLIN' YOU, DAD. THINK ABOUT IT. - HUNTER, YOU'RE SO SILLY. - GARLIC. I NEED SOME GARLIC. WHO HAS SOME GARLIC? - HUNTER! - I'M AFRAID WE DON'T USE GARLIC HERE. - AND WHY WOULD THAT BE? OH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BECAUSE THIS IS A VAMPIRE RESTAURANT! - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. I'M TAKING YOU HOME. I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE. - NO, NO, NO! - HE HAS A VIVID IMAGINATION. - NO, I'M NOT IMAGINING THINGS! SHE KILLED UNCLE DRAGOMIR! SHE'S GONNA SEND OUT THE SIGNAL! - OKAY, THAT'S--I'M-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. - DAVID, REALLY, IT'S-IT'S O--IT'S OKAY. OOH, PUNKIN', ARE YOU FEELING OKAY? YOU SHOULD GET HIM HOME. - YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS. - NO, NO, NO. DON'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT. I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO AT THE OFFICE. YOU KNOW ME, ALWAYS LIKE TO BURN THAT MIDNIGHT OIL. BYE-BYE. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. - NO, DAD-- - COME ON. - I BELIEVE YOU, BRO. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. IF YOU EVER NEED BACKUP, YOU HOLLER AT YOUR BOY. I GOT YOUR BACK. - I PROMISE! IT'S ALL TRUE! - THIS ENDS NOW. OKAY. NO MORE VAMPIRES, NO MORE MONSTERS, NO MORE ALIENS. WHEN WE GET HOME, I AM GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING. YOU GOT IT? - YEAH, FINE! GET RID OF IT. SELL IT ALL. JUST LISTEN-- - NOT ANOTHER WORD. - JORDAN'S A WEREWOLF! - OKAY, LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME. I MEAN, I GET IT. I'M A FREAK.

I'M MAKING A SILVER BULLET ? ? WHAT A BUNCH OF BIG DOPES ? - WHAT WAS THAT? - YOUR DAUGHTER. - WHOA. - WE NEED TO GET HER BACK TO THE CASTLE BEFORE SUNRISE, OR... SHE'S GONNA BE LIKE THAT FOREVER. - OH, SHE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. - THIS JUST NEVER GETS OLD. - OH, GOOD. YOU'RE AWAKE. - WOULD YOU GIVE IT A REST? NICE TRY. - I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND, DAD. - NO, I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING TO BOTH OF YOU. HUNTER, I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU. JORDAN, THIS NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU, HONEY. YOUR MOTHER WOULD HAVE HANDLED THIS SO MUCH BETTER, BUT I'M NOT YOUR MOM. - NO ONE IS, BUT YOU'RE OUR DAD. - HELLO, PAGING DR. PHIL! - PAULINA, THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN. LET THEM GO. OH, DAVID. AH, YEAH. UM, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN WAITING 300 YEARS FOR THAT CASTLE, AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET SOME TEENAGE TEST TUBE WEREWOLF GET IN MY WAY. - YOU HAVE THE CASTLE. JUST TAKE IT, AND LET THEM GO. LET THEM GO. - WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, BOO BEAR, MY SCRUMDILLYICIOUS COOKIE-FACE, I CAN'T OFFICIALLY TAKE POSSESSION OF WOLFSBERG MANOR IF THERE'S A LIVING VUKOVIC WEREWOLF. "LIVING." - NO ONE EVER READS THE CONTRACTS. NOW, HMM, WHERE WAS I? OH, RIGHT. - RELAX, HONEY. YOU'RE JUST GONNA FEEL A LITTLE PINCH. - NO! - LET ME GUESS.
