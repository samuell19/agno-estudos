You're French? What are you doing here? I was in an impersonation contest. You imitated Charlie Chaplin? Do you need help? Do you want me to drop you off somewhere? Let's go, come on. The world could use a little Christian charity. Come on! Come on, let's go, don't be afraid. "A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you." War. Such idiocy. Where are you headed? To Detroit, to the east. - To my uncle's. - Your uncle? I'm going to stay with him and wait until I can go back home. - But where's home? - Montreal. Ah. La Nouvelle France. It's America up there too. So, the competition-did you win it? - Really? - Yes. Congratulations! - Thanks. - That's incredible. My name is Hector Batignole, I'm a talent agent. I travel the country looking for new talent. I'm looking for that rare pearl. Do you know where the next station is? No, I don't know, but I know a small village not far from here where workers stop to spend the night. In the mornings they leave and head out in different directions. Maybe someone can take you with them? I can drop you off if you like. Yes, that's very kind. I would really appreciate it. Chaplin? You have to know how to seize an opportunity when it arises. You have to be positive in life, Philippe. Myself, I'm an optimist. There are spots to be taken, and better me than someone else. All this sadness, this melancholy all around us... someone has to do something! I see potential in you, my friend. After that, developing your career isn't your concern. It's my job. Are you starting to imagine all the success, the glory, the fame that awaits you? You're not going to tell me it doesn't make you start to dream about it... That's my protégé! I discovered him in a little hole in the wall. He's come really far, that boy. Thank you very much for your help. Thank you. Not at all, Philippe, it's only natural. Here. Don't forget! The workers arrive tomorrow morning. You'll see, it's really nice. Rest for a while. So then, Philippe, I hope you make it home soon, and I wish you a marvelous life. Thank you so much. You have a good life, too. Philippe! We'll meet again! I believe in you! Hello? - Mother! - Philippe, is it you? Yes, it's me. Oh, my darling boy. Are you all right? Yes, yes. Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm happy to talk to you. They came yesterday, Philippe. They asked me questions for an hour. I told them I haven't seen you. - Did they believe you? - I don't know. You're not the first one here who doesn't want to go fight. This goddamn war! And you, are you okay? I know times are hard. It will be okay, Philippe. But they will definitely come back. Go to your uncle's. And don't worry about me, my boy. I just want you to know I'm thinking about you. Go to Louis's like you planned, he'll hide you until the war is over. Be patient. And take care of yourself. Yes, I'm trying, but I'm stuck in a town... Look at these illiterates. These poor fools. He's pathetic, your Chaplin. I'll never be able to sell him. We could use him for a job or two. He could be useful. What do you want from me? Did someone here give you permission to speak? What do you want from me? Wait. I'm going to explain something. If you want to keep your eardrums intact and avoid dying in excruciating pain... Are you listening? The rules here are my rules. I'm the one who makes them. Your rights are dictated by me. You can scream and yell like a girl, it won't change a thing. No one can hear you. And it bothers me. So are you going to do what I say? You stay in your hole and you shut your mouth. You move when I decide that you move. You speak when I decide that you speak. You sleep when I decide that you sleep. And if I tell you to piss all over yourself, well-you piss all over yourself. You're insane. You're sick. How's it going, Chaplin? Go on, here. Go ahead, eat. You must be hungry. Here. Go on. There you go. See, I'm not so bad. I'm just like you. I never wanted to end up in this hole. I had nowhere to go. You know, he's going to make your life very hard if you don't cooperate. You're better off doing what he says and working for them. Here. And besides, you have talent. You have to have talent to win an impersonation contest like you did. I really think my partner could find a good place for you. I told you never to speak to the merchandise. You're not my partner. You work for me. And you obey me. Wait, I have a good tip for you. Some people are coming in from the south soon. It'll be a sure thing. You won't have to do a thing. I'll take care of everything. I swear it. Trust me. Get out. "And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, that fell upon men like a punishment. And each one was judged according to his deeds." Let us go. You know, it's not your fault. This is a time of terrible weather. And you happen to be in the eye of the storm. You see, before I came here, I was nothing. I was a poor nobody. Anonymous, powerless. Like all these people you don't even notice on the street, like you. You, Chaplin, you and your whole breed of good-for-nothings. And you see, this country permits me to do whatever I want. It gives me everything. It makes me everything. It even allows me to be reborn. It makes me its glorious son: violent and powerful. There's a kind of beauty in that, you see? It's magnificent. It's the reason I'm here. And I don't make the rules. Why would I give myself limits? There are no limits here. No restraint. No scruples. If I want something from you, I just have to take it. If I want to lock you up in a cage and sell you, whole or in pieces, I can do it. It is my will. And my will is all-powerful. There's only one thing left for you to do... And that's pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, keep praying. Like everyone else. Every night I thank the stars above that I'm here. You're the ones who are weak. You're cowards. Swindlers. You're completely worthless. A monster. Pathetic. You should disappear. Get up. Go on, go ahead. Make me laugh. Get up. Go on, show me your impression. Do it. Make me laugh, I said. So? Hello? It's Philippe. Hello? Is that you? Hello? Oh, it's you, Philippe. What's going on? What's going on, Philippe? Philippe, my darling boy. Where are you? Are you okay, at least? Promise me you're okay. Don't worry, I'm okay. Things haven't gone well, Mother. I don't know how I'm going to get through. But I won't give up. I promise. I was never the most capable in life. I was never the strongest. But like I told you, I won't give up. I don't know how, I don't know when, but I'll come back. If anything ever happens to me, Mother... If there's some misfortune and I never get to hold your beautiful face in my hands... I just want to tell you that... I love you. That I'm sorry for everything. I have to hang up. Don't forget what I said... and think of me. I'll come home.
