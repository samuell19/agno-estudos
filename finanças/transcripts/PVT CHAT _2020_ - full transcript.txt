Hey. Do you smoke? In private. Cool, will you do verbal abuse? Yeah, for sure. It'll be easier with you. I can just tell. Where are you from? San Francisco. I'm from New York City. I don't care. I bet you wanna see my tits so bad, don't you? Oh, fuck. Yeah. Okay, that's it. That's all you get. Fuck. I'm so fucking hard. Well, if you wanna come, you have to tip me. Fuck, okay. You know what? Now I don't even wanna smoke anymore. - Stick your tongue out. - Okay. Stick your tongue out. Okay, I'm putting it out on your tongue now. Okay. Swallow it. Swallow the butt. I want you to kiss the bottom of my shoe. Ready? Kiss it. Lick it, lick it. You're so dumb. I bet you wanna come on my ass, don't you? - Yeah? - Uh-huh. Unfortunately, slaves don't get to experience this. You guys can only watch from afar. I want you to come hard for me. - Okay, slave? - Okay. Oh God. - I'm coming. - Yeah? Yeah. You coming for me now? Uh-huh. Give me all your cum. It's all mine. Yeah. Oh, hi. Do you have any sessions available tonight? Oh, good. So how much usually do you charge? 220? Okay. And that's for all the way? Heads. Fuck. Oh, hey, Henry, did you get my check? Yeah, three weeks late. Sorry, man. Where are you going? Out! Player has blackjack! Yeah! Player busts. Please, dear God. - Dealer busts. - Yes! Player wins. Dealer has blackjack. God damn it. Would you like insurance? No. Come on, come on! Dealer has blackjack. Fuck! Hi, babe. Wanna go private? Yeah, mostly just chilling. I am actually about to play some blackjack. Ooh! Yeah, it's actually what I do for a living. Really? Really. What do you do, like count cards? No, I don't count cards. I play online mostly, so you can't count them online. Do you wanna play with me? I could show you some strategy. We could even play in the same room. Let's just do it. Let's just get in a room and start playing. What do you think? Actually, babe, it's getting a little bit late for me. Oh, really? Come on, we just started chatting. Do you want me to tip you more? I can be generous with my tips. It was nice to talk to you. Oh, for real? That's how it's gonna be? Sorry, babe. All right, well I'm attracted to you. Gotta go, babe. Fuck. Hey, what's up? Look who it is. Good to see you again. I didn't expect you back so soon. I was pretty brutal last time. What have you been doing since we last spoke? Nothing much, just abusing slaves like you. Come on. How much do I have to tip you for you to just like, drop the act a little bit and just talk to me? 200 Tokens. - Okay. - Okay. Ooh, 200 tokens. I guess I used to kind of enjoy painting. Wow, that's fucking awesome. No, it's not. Yes, that's amazing! You're an artist? That's the coolest thing I've heard all day. Ugh, well then your life must be pretty boring if that's the coolest thing you've heard all day. I'm impressed. Do you have anything I could see, - like a painting to show me? - No. What do you do? I work in the tech industry. Oh, cool. So you like, fix computers and cell phones and stuff? Well, I don't fix computers. I'm an app developer. Oh, cool. Well, I'm actually currently developing this app that's gonna like, totally revolutionize the way people communicate. Well, okay. Well, so basically, it's a device that will allow people to trade thoughts, like directly through the cloud without having to talk or type, but just think. Yeah, it's called See Stream. So is it like a chip? Like am I implanted? Basically using nanotechnology, we're gonna develop a chip that goes into one of the parts of your brain, which we're not sure yet. And it's gonna be something that basically digitizes thoughts and allows them to be accessed by anyone in the world that signs up for this subscription-based service that we're offering. So I could hear someone's thoughts from across the world, like a random person that also has this chip? Yeah, yeah, if they sign up for the See Stream, yeah. Whoa, that's cool! God, honestly, I just can't wait for people to really experience this because I think that me talking about it doesn't really do it justice. Because I think when you hear about it, you think like, "Oh, I get to read someone's thoughts." They'd be like a stream of thoughts or a stream of words. But when you're inside See Stream, you're literally experiencing someone's thoughts as if they were your thoughts. Would you love to know what I'm thinking about right now? Yes, what are you thinking? Can you tell me? That you should tip me. I don't think you're thinking that. What are you really think? Do you want me to smoke? Yeah, but can you just tell me what you're thinking, please? I don't care. It doesn't have to be anything cool. I just want to know. Ugh. I'm thinking that I wish I was as passionate about something as you are about See Stream. Just do me a favor, okay? Think of every person you know. Uh-huh. No, think, think. Think of your friends, your lovers, people from work, your parents, your family, all the people you interact with on social media. Are you thinking? Uh-huh. How do you relate to these people? I don't know, it depends. No, no, come on. Tell me, what's the common thread in all your relationships? I don't know. You use these people or they use you. That's not just because you're a cam girl. Behind every single interaction that you'll have is one, maybe two thoughts; what can I get out of this or what is it that you're gonna do for me? I'ma put it out on your tongue. You feel the burning, don't you? Yeah, swallow it! Swallow it. What do you say? Thank you. Yeah, are you gonna cum for me now? Yeah. Tell me when you're about to cum. Okay. Tell me when you're about to cum. You almost there? Yeah. Yeah, you're really close? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, stop. Stop. Okay, let me see your hands. I wanna make sure you stopped. Let me see your hands. Ugh, you're so disgusting. Hold this. Hey, when do you think we can renew the lease? Can we do that today or? I'm not gonna renew your lease. Look, I'm gonna have some guys come and do some repairs next week. They're gonna repaint this wall and they're gonna install that skylight. You know my subletter? He died, so he's been out for a bit. Not that you care, but all right, well. Oh. I didn't hear that. Fuck, what the fuck is going on? Hey there. How are you? My name's William. You can call me Will. Jesus fucking Christ, man. This paint smells like fucking shit. Yeah, I guess you get used to it. Do you really have to be doing this now? No. And we're getting paid to do it. Get it done a little faster if you wanna help. You're not gonna believe this shit, man. Honest to God. I'm in San Francisco in 1978 looking for a job. This guy has got this ad looking for a sprayer, so I go up to see him. Old man, dingy office, right? Just me and him. Old guy looks like Willie Nelson or something, right? And he says, "Hey man, I looked at your resume. "I know you can spray. "You want this job?" I'm like, "Yeah, I need the money. "I really need the money." He's like, "You sure you want this job?" I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I want the job." Then he takes his nose, right, off of his face and he puts it on his desk. I'm staring at these two holes in the middle of his face. His nose is sitting on his desk like a freaking trophy. I'm just looking at his nose. And I got freaked out. I didn't say yes, I didn't say no, I just got up and ran. I mean, try to pick up some chicks with that number, huh? You can't even get any mercy action. Hey, do you mind if I just throw some shit in that empty room? Yeah, sure, go for it. Thanks. So how are things with the See Stream? Oh, thank you so much for asking. They're great. You know, no, no, we had a phone meeting with one of my investors today, and it's incredible. He just okayed the second round of funding. So I mean we're good with our research. We can do the second phase. It's actually incredible. No way, really? Yeah. Oh my God, congratulations. Well, thank you so much. That's great news. Yeah, I was actually thinking about See Stream earlier today this morning. You were? Uh-huh. No way, really? Yep. What was the context? Well, I was reading a book. What kind of book? I don't remember. Okay? But it was a painting book, and I was just thinking like, it would be so cool to read it, or like, I dunno, I guess experience it over See Stream. That is so cool that you were thinking about See Stream just like in your personal life. Oh my God, that gives me all the inspiration I could ever need for like, 10 lifetimes, like 10 See Streams. But you'll be inside the mind of your favorite author. I mean, what could be a more gratifying experience than that? Yeah, that's true. You could totally understand not just because it's a painting book, not just like how they did it, 'cause you could only read so much from a historical point of view, right? But if you are literally inside the mind of the artist, you might be able to get something of their soul. Hey man, did you put this hole in the wall here, man? No, that was my roommate. Are you as good at blackjack as you say you are? Yeah, I'm pretty good. Yeah, can you teach me a few things? Sure. Do you wanna play? Yeah, man, I'd love to. Do you have money? I got a little bit of bread. What do you need? Well, I mean, whatever you got. But you know, I got a friend of mine. He loves cards. If he's not in jail, he'd come right over. Okay, cool, let's do it. You don't mind? Mind? No, let's go! Let's go! All right, see, 14 against a four, some people would say you have to stay, but with a player like me, how I'm feeling, you gotta put your balls - on the face cards. - You already got two face cards. You're bound - to get another one. - No, no, no, it's happening. See, you see? Didn't I say he'd get another one? He's gonna bust, he's gonna bust, he's gonna bust. - Yes! - Yes, bust! That is so exactly how I fucking fuck with them. That is how I fucked them in the. - 1,000. - Here we go, here we go, here we go, 16. 20. - Stay, stay, stay! - 20, stay, stay, stay! This is ours. Yes! - 1,000 bucks! - Oh, shit! Yes, that's what I'm talking... Look at this balance. Look at this balance, bitches! Look at this fucking balance! 4,500, man. - Oh my God, I'm hot! - Yeah! Oh my God, I'm hot! Woo, yes! That is why they call me Blackjack Jack. All right, okay. That's how we fucking, this is how we go. Blackjack Jack. Dealer 21, you lose. Yes! Player wins. Yes! Dealer 20, you lose. You. - Oh my God. - Player busts. You lose. Please insert money to play more. No more bets. 35 black odd. You're alienated from other people. I'm not, I see people all the time. I do. And in fact, knowing this about people makes me feel more connected to them. When I was living with the delusion that people actually cared for me, it was much more alienating than knowing that that was just false. You don't think anyone cares for you? I think they do in moments when it props up their own worldview about them as a caring person. ♪ Nowhere else in this world I'd rather be ♪ ♪ Than with you here ♪ ♪ Playing songs with me ♪ Hey there, gorgeous. Damn, you really are gorgeous. Hello, are you there? Hello? Can I help you, sir? Oh. No. It's good, I'm sorry. Hey, Emma, what's up? I saw your text. You got plans tonight? Mic check. Look at you showing up! Oh, hey! Hey! Oh yeah, this looks incredible. I ordered way too many bottles of wine. Drink as much as you like. Mic check. - Thank you. - Yeah. Who are friends over here? Oh my God, you've gotta meet these guys. They're great. - Larry? - Mic check. Mic check. Jack, what's up? Come over here for a second. Oh, hey, what's up, baby girl? So Larry, this is my friend, Emma. Damn, look at that dress, look at that little nose ring. - Nice to meet you, Emma. - Nice to meet you. She made the art here, this is all hers. - Wow, you made all this? - Yeah, I did. - That's very impressive. - Thank you. I like it. What do you think it's? It's beautiful. Not as beautiful as you though, of course. Mic check. I actually know a couple guys who are really into art that would probably pay you very handsomely for selling them some art. You really know people that would buy art? Yes, I do, I know a lot of people. - For real? - Yes, for real! Come on, you don't know anyone like that. Why are you always doubting me, bro? What? I'm not always doubting you. I mean, I know you just met me, but like, come on. I'm a stand up guy. I need to teach you how to box some day. - Come on. - No, I can't. This is a civilized place. Nobody's doubting my integrity. I'm not totally doubting... could do it all day. Learn how to box, man! Get into a hobby! Come on, come on, come on, Jack. I'm gonna be right back, I'll be right back. Come on, Jack, come on, Jack, come on, Jack. Wait, wait, wait. Watch out for her bread, man! I know, dude, dude. This guy's gonna fuck up your art. Emma Voiceover: Mic check. Hey, I know you ain't gonna grab me! Mic check. Dude, dude, shit. All right, all right, all right. You are the superior boxer. Oh, whoa, whoa. Yeah, yeah, get strong. I like that. - I like that. - Would you quit that? I like that, I like that. You've got some strength. I'll fucking kill you. Mic check. Mic check. Yeah. Larry! You underestimate me, motherfucker? - Guys, what the fuck? - Mic check. Are you kidding me right now? Stop, stop, stop! Check. Mic check. Mic check. Ugh, another inane artwork on the failure of Occupy Wall Street. Mic check. It wasn't a failure. Mic check. Well, I didn't say it was a failure. No, you did. You just said Occupy Wall Street was a failure. I think we all could agree that the artwork could be stronger, but I do agree with you that Occupy Wall Street as a movement was necessary. It was necessary. I mean, it spread to 82 countries. It like, made the whole idea of the class divide a popular concept. Yeah, but so what? What did it accomplish? No, but that's the point. It didn't accomplish anything. I mean, nothing for nothing. You know any rich guys that have any spare change lying around? Big spenders? My son got into this really good college. Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check. - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check. Mic... So what are you up to now? Do you wanna maybe come back to my spot? I thought we weren't allowed to see each other again? No, I don't mean like that. - I don't mean like that! - Part of your rules. I mean just as friends. We could hang out. I could play some blackjack, show you some tricks. I don't want to watch you play video games. It's not a fucking video game! It's my job! Look, just because I don't have a conventional job like your idle yuppie friends - doesn't make me a fucking... - Yuppie? What the fuck? - What the fuck? - Is this the 80s? God, you gotta insult better. What? I gotta get you another time. This is so typical. Can I get some more wine? Yeah, I mean, there's a store like on Bushwick, if you wanna go? Cool. Hey, I actually have to make a phone call. So you want me to get it? Okay. Wait, so what's this doppelganger that you've seen? I saw a girl and she looks exactly like you. I bet she wasn't as hot as me. She looked exactly like you. Okay, well I've never been to New York, so. Huh, can you smoke for me? Is that what you want? You wanna see smoke come out of my big beautiful lips? Uh-huh. Yeah? Yeah. You know, Jackie? Maybe you're right. Maybe I do live next door. Wouldn't that be torture? Oh God, that would suck. To know that I'm so close? And you think about me all day and fantasize about me all night. Don't you wish you could play with my pussy? Slaves don't get to play with my pussy. So you'll just have to settle for the smoke. Open up. - Your cock is mine. - Uh-huh. - Your cum is mine. - Uh-huh. - You are mine. - Uh-huh. Your money is mine. Jack? Jack, give me all that cum. - It's my cum. - Fuck. - Yeah. - It's my fucking cum. Yeah. Cum for me, Jackie. What the fuck are you doing in my room? Hey, could I borrow your copy of Ulysses? No, I'm right in the middle of that. Believe it or not, so am I. It's getting kind of late. I think I should probably get going. You're gonna make me finish this bottle by myself? You're so tense. Can't be good for you to be staring at your computer all day long gambling. Yeah, probably not. Definitely not. Hey, you know what? You should go to one of my classes some time. Yeah, I don't think so. You know, yoga's not really my thing. Who is that, Larry? Listen, Emma, I'm sorry. I really have to go. Well, who is it? Come on! I don't wanna let you sneak out of this. Yeah, I'm sorry. I gotta take this. Sorry. Hello? No, not at all. Who is it? What do you wanna show me? Who is it? Who is it? No. Who is it? So what is this that you wanna show me? Okay, I haven't shown anyone yet, okay? You're the first person. Oh, I'm the first? - Wow. - Okay, that's an honor. It's an honor that I am bestowing upon you. Can you see it? Oh my God, whoa! That's fucking incredible. I want your honest opinion. Oh my, yes. Move it in closer. I wanna see it close. Oh shit. I love this view. Damn, there's like whole worlds inside all those little details. Okay, slow down. No, really, this is so fucking good. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying that because I wanna get in your pants. You totally wanna get in my pants. I mean, maybe yes, but this is... You wanna get in my pants so bad. No, I'm serious! I don't believe a word you say! What? It's like one of the best paintings I've ever seen. This could totally be on one of the walls at the fucking MoMA. Yeah, okay, sure. - You're crazy. - I'm serious right now. You're lying. Oh my God. I love it. Thanks. That's amazing. You say everything I do is amazing. I don't even know if you're being real or not. - Okay, sure. - No, I'm being totally real. Hey, can I show you a painting? Okay. I didn't do this but it's definitely my favorite. What do you think? I think she's naked. I think she looks exactly like you. What are you listening to? Beethoven. You like it? Yeah, I guess. I'm not really familiar with any of his songs. What kind of stuff do you listen to? Stuff from the past century? I don't know. This recording was done in the past century. Okay, whatever. I don't listen to Beethoven. Do you like it? That's pretty good! Yeah, I'm on a roll today. It's my second one. Scarlet, do you mind if I introduce you to my friends Will and Larry? They're right here. Here, just say hi real quick. Hey, Scarlet! When I talk to you, I sort of feel intimidated because I feel like you're like, the coolest person I've ever met. I am so far from cool. So how'd you start being a dom? I was into before I can even remember. Yeah, when I was little, I would always choose like, the weakest boy in the class, like the one that got picked on the most, and I would request play dates with him, and I would just torture him. Yeah. I used to make this one boy pretend to be a pony. Show me again? It's incredible. I love the way you use the yellow. Yeah. I wanted to switch it up a little bit and try something new. Hey, so let's play a little game. I don't like games. What kind of game? I know you live in New York City. I do not live in New York. I've never been there. I don't know what you're talking about. No, I saw you the other night. You did not see me. - You saw my doppelganger. - I did, I did, and I'm not mad. I'm mad! I get it! I get your need to keep your work and your private life separate. What would you say if I had a picture of you in New York? I wanna see it. What would you say if I had a picture of you in New York? I'd say, wow, you're really great at Photoshop. Okay, here's the deal. If I get evidence, like a picture or a video of you here, you have to go on a trip with me to Paris. I can't just pick up and go to Paris with you. Why not? - Yeah, of course you can. - That's crazy. - No, you're crazy. - Of course you can. No, think about it, think about it! We could have the best time ever. We could go see all the greatest museums, see the best paintings known to man. We could drink wine by the sand, we could listen to beautiful music, make love. - Come on! - Okay. That all sounds wonderful, but you're never gonna get a picture of me. - I don't live in New York. - Oh. - I'm sorry, I wish I did. - Oh, game is on. Game is on, girl. Game is on. Well, what are you ding-dongs doing here? Got a business proposition for you. My son's tuition is due in a week. In one week I gotta come up with 25 grand. Listen, if we give you money right now, can you win it back for us in blackjack? I mean, you know all the tricks and shit, right? Yeah, I could win, but I mean, if it's your son's tuition, I could easily lose it. That's not even the most sound financial plan. That's a risk he's willing to take, but if you could win, then there's a little kickback in it for. No, I wouldn't be doing this as like a fucking moneymaker. - I'm just saying. - I would do it to help, but all right, hold on. Let's talk real figures here. How much do you have? I got about a quarter of what we need. - No, dude, I can't. - Six, you have six. - A quarter? - A quarter. It's risky for me to play with anything less than half. He has six. How much do you need? Yeah, 'cause that's all I got. I got six solid, liquid. If I put in five, our pot would be 11, and then we can do that in one hand. I could fucking double your money in one fucking hand. You could do that, man? Of course I can. You think I don't do it like every fucking night? I mean, we could put his whole 6,000 on a fucking roulette. And if that's the case... No, I don't wanna do that, man. None of this 50-50 shit. No, no, I can win it in like, four hands. I need like, four solid hands. I'll tell you something. Like a week ago I don't think I would be ready for this. But right now, I don't wanna jinx anything, but stars are really aligning in my life, and I feel like now is the perfect moment to capitalize but not in a capitalistic way. Look, I'll pay you back every single penny. You don't have to worry about that. This is all for your fucking son, okay? Man. But okay. Let's chill. Let's pretend this conversation didn't happen for like five minutes and then we'll revisit the idea. Cool? Good idea. - Push. - This is how it goes. Yeah, you have to win two to lose. Yeah, but there's a lot of push on this fucking machine, bro. I know, it's okay. Here, here, here. This is where we make up for it. - Push. - Fuck! What did I just say? I know, I know. You don't say shit like that. It puts it in the ether. You know, they listen to you, you know? Don't. Dude, man, you're up like $1,100. Yeah, I know, but I'm gonna lose right now. So watch me, I'm gonna do a small one. Don't say that, man. No, it's not a bad thing. Oh, you're going down. I just feel that this one is not it. Take it anyways, man. Just take it. Like, I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised if they get 20. - Dealer busts. - Oh, okay, that's fine. - I don't know, bud. - We're on a good streak. So I'm gonna take advantage of that. 101 Dalmatians. Dealer busts. That's what I'm talking about! Don't fucking let me bet small, because when I go small, I go fucking yeah! - Let's go! - Straight up, straight up! 50s and 100s, man. Just fucking , man! That's why they call me Blackjack Jack! Gotta go. I gotta roll. - Oh, shit! - Player busts. Damn it! Hey, man, you should... No, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Henry, hey. What the hell is going on down here? - Henry... - I'm sorry we've been a little bit too loud. Get in here, man, smoke a bowl. I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to get out of here. I'm gonna be out of here in three days. And I figured out a way to get all of these books and everything gone, all right? We're playing some cards, Henry. Come on. We're doing one hit, is that cool? This has got to be the worst paint job I've ever seen in my life. It's just one coat, Henry. All right. Also, question for you. What made you decide to go with this color? Because it's not typical. It's like Area 51 in here, man. There's a family moving in and the children like the color. - Really? - Oh. What're you gonna do? Aliens. Henry, come on. Okay, see you, buddy. I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna keep him under control, okay? Okay, I gotta get up early in the morning, so try to keep it down? Oh, right, all right. Okay, sorry, sorry. All right, love you, thank you, Henry. Yo, get me a beer, man. Hey, Jackie. So what's this big news you have to tell me? Did you finally snap a picture of me? Oh, well, it's not really that big a deal. I just wanted to tell somebody. So you remember that guy that you saw me with, the older one? Oh, yeah, I remember him. Yeah, well, I'm gonna help him pay for his son's first year of college. Oh God. I'm embarrassed to say this, but what the reason I wanted to tell you is, you know how people say you make me a better person, or my lover makes me a better person? Well, I feel like I finally get what that means now. Thinking about quitting camming. What, really, you are? Yeah. Why? It was never really supposed to be this longterm thing. It just kind of happened. Well, you know what you should be doing is painting full-time. Is there a way we could still keep in touch? Maybe. Are you gonna give me a discount on the See Stream? God, yes! Of course! You're one of my beta testers. You know, either way, it totally doesn't matter, 'cause soon enough we'll both be on a plane to Paris. What was that? What was what? I heard something. I heard someone come in. Turn the camera over there. No. Like, no one is here. I'm the only person here, relax. Wait, why are you lying to me? Turn the camera. I'm not fucking lying. I'm not turning the camera. Yeah, you are; I'm paying you right now! Don't forget the meter's fucking running! Turn the camera! Oh, wow. Okay. You know what? I don't fucking need this shit from you, so have a nice day, Jack. What do you want, Duke? Since when do you do cam shows in our bedroom? So there's something that I have to tell you. We've saved up enough and we got the liquor license. That's so good! Duke's is fully operational. Oh, you did it! The stage is ready for play. That's incredible, babe. And it was a long and arduous journey, but now we're all set. Babe, what's the deal with this Jack guy? He's loaded, right? He's like some kind of Wall Street or Silicon Valley type of dude? I guess. He's clearly fucking crazy for you. I bet you could ask him for some extra funds. There's just gonna be all these extra costs next few months. And I still gotta pay the fucking PR guys. Oh, and they might get the Times - to come to our opening. - No way? We might get the New York fucking Times to come down. - You're kidding? - I'm not kidding. I mean, it's not written in stone yet. Babe, that's amazing! - I know! - Oh my God. We just need a little bit more. Yeah. Baby, do you remember what we used to always talk about? I mean, the reason why I wanted to open Duke's for you? We want me to create from a place of love, not of resistance. And we do. I make us money so you can do your thing. I love you so much. I know. - Hi. - Hey. What's up? Just phone calls. Yeah, are you busy? Yeah. Did you have a chance to read my notes on the script? No, I've been so busy. I haven't. I mean, just phone calls, and with the money not being raised yet, we have to have something set in stone now. I know, but you made it seem like it was so urgent. I did it overnight. It was urgent, but like, we don't have the money yet. And we can't keep changing the scripts at this point. You know, as far as investors and... - Uh-huh. - You understand. Investors? You mean me? Okay, guys, whenever you're ready. One more time. From the top? - Yes, please. - All right. All I'm saying, it's gonna be fucking terrific. It's better than terrific. It's gonna be fucking unbelievable. When the theater space opens and you can quit talking to these men and just... When? When you finally get the money, and then you'll quit, and then we'll just be working here together. I don't think we're ever gonna have enough money for me to quit. We're almost there. Are you kidding me? What if I don't want to? That's the whole thing. That's what we're talking about right now. That's not what we talked about. I mean, you're hurting me right now. I don't understand. Well, that's on you. If you're hurt, it's on you. But here's the thing, this is what we've always worked towards. Would you rather be poor and doing what you want, or be somebody's fucking whore and rich? I really don't appreciate it when you call me a whore. I'm not calling you a whore. I'm just saying... - Well, you just did! - I mean, okay... You just called me somebody's whore. Okay, look in a dictionary, and the definition of a whore is someone who performs sexual favors for money. - I - don't feel like a whore. So by definition, you're a whore. Are you calling me a whore? Do you think I'm a whore? No, I don't, but well, yes, I do, because by definition, you're a whore! Well, get over it. - Get over it. - By definition, - you're a whore. - Get over it. Get over it. Okay, I mean, I love whores. I don't have anything against whores. Oh, well, was anyone gonna tell me that the fucking play was about me? The play's not just about you. Well, you're fucking showcasing all my personal business. It's fucking embarrassing. Look, this is still just the rehearsal. We'll get there. You know, it's not gonna be so autobiographical, but in order for the actors to know where to take it, me and Sandra talked about it and just felt like, you know, that the other rehearsals were a little flat. Maybe if we used some of the stuff from our life, it would make it have a little bit more panache. Okay, and you didn't think to tell me that? You didn't think that that was important, that maybe I should know that, right? I thought I told you. You know you didn't fucking tell me! My whole thing is honesty. I mean, that's like what I'm all about, and that's what this was supposed to be. No. Maybe I'm too honest sometimes. I get it, I get it, I get it. Maybe I'm too honest sometimes. And I'm sorry for that. You were honest at my expense. If it was at your expense, it was equally mine. I feel like we share everything, so sure, sometimes whenever I'm self-flagellating, you get part of the collateral damage. And I'm sorry for that. I'm trying to be better about that. But like, right now where I'm at, yeah, you're in the play because you're what I think about most of the day, and the idea that I would not bring you in there seems fucking stupid. The play's personal. That felt so real and uncomfortable. And I feel honestly like raped, or something of my own issues that I haven't even come to terms with; to then just see them like that, thrown in my face. Right. But isn't that like, kind of a good thing, that you know... No, it's not a fucking good thing! Okay, I just mean in terms of like, we come to this space to have reactions, good and bad, and so the fact that you're seeing this on like, a really early rehearsal, you felt like visceral. I feel like in my mind, that's a sign that we're onto something. No. - Duke? - What? I just need to know if what that fucking shitty actor was saying, was it true? Is that how you really feel? No. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Mic check. Keep your head still and try not to blink. I want you to imagine there's an invisible box around your head, and if you move your head even just one inch, you will set off a trigger. What does the trigger do? I feel like you're not taking this seriously. Look at me. I am taking this seriously. For how much longer do I have to do this? This is your punishment for logging off on me. You will do whatever I tell you to do, okay? Okay. Look at me. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. Like that? Repeat after me, I have the sexiest body that anybody's ever seen. I have the sexiest body that anyone's ever seen. Yeah, that's good. That's a good girl. I have the hottest mouth that can make any cock rock hard. Say that. I have the hottest mouth that could make any cock rock hard. Say it again. I have the hottest fucking mouth that can make any cock rock hard. I have the hottest fucking mouth that could make any cock rock hard. Take off your shirt. Take off your bra. Oh yeah. Oh my God, so fucking hot. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, fuck yeah. Oh my God, yeah. Taste yourself. Taste your fingers. Oh my God, yeah. Talk to me. Tell me you wanna fuck me. I wanna fuck you so hard, baby. - I - wanna fuck you too. Oh God, yeah. So this room was my roommate's. Why is it so empty? Well, he's gone. Where'd he go? Oh, that is the million dollar question. Nobody knows. What do you mean nobody knows? He just disappeared? He's dead. Oh. Sorry. Sorry, my bad. It's all right. What happened? Well, one thing you could say about Joe was that like, he wasn't a hypocrite. He didn't just talk about suicide. He actually did it. Damn, how'd he do it? Heroin. I forgot my keys one night and so I was like, banging on the door to get him to let me in, and he wasn't answering, so I was just like, "Oh, shoot, what the fuck's up?" Has he like, got his headphones on or must be just like, really fucked up, like normal. I actually ended up breaking in through the window, this one right here. And yeah, I found him lying on the floor. He'd been dead for almost like, three days. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. He's not suffering anymore. 30 minutes later though, I was at a massage parlor getting a tug. You were not? Damn straight. Oh my God. You're such a perv. Yeah, you love it. Is that kind of when you started getting into cam girls? No, I've been into cam girls for a minute. Am I your favorite cam girl? Like God, you're my favorite girl, period. So right before he died, my roommate Joe, he told me something that I haven't been able to get out of my system. It's this idea that he held very strongly. And basically, it's just that like, we as humans, every relationship that we're in is exploitative. And yes, I mean that in a Marxist way, like with capital, but also just interpersonally. Like, nobody is in a relationship with anyone, any relationship, even parent/child that isn't based on a selfish gain. Just like, do you feel like you've ever done something for somebody else that wasn't partially to make yourself feel good? Well. We don't get this money by Monday, the whole show will have been for nothing. You know, all of our hard work? I thought Duke had his money? Not enough, apparently. It's cheap. I like that. Yeah, it's cheap. I mean, you could afford more. I mean, you make bank on that site, right? You live in a space big enough to hold a studio and a theater space and.... Hey, Larry, what's up? Jackie-boy! You won't believe who the fuck I just saw coming around the corner. Who? That broad from San Francisco, the cam girl. Wait, what? Are you fucking serious? Yeah, I'm dead serious. Where are you? How much is she worth to you? You know what, I want $500. 500? Matter of fact, matter of fact, 600. Matter of fact, $600. Okay, okay, that's fine. Where are you? I want 750 of your motherfucking, cock-sucking dollars, - how about that? - Bro! How about that, Jackie-boy? Bro, are you fucking kidding me? I can't give you $750! I'm fucking with you, bro. All right, look. I'm gonna trust you on this, all right? Please, can you do it right now? I got you. Bye. Fucking pussy stitch. Ooh. You here to see Duke? Yeah. He's upstairs. Have you seen what he's up to lately? Fucking incredible. So far out. It's so fucking good. And this is the big inaugural show. It has to be something special. I was thinking of getting like, the same letting guy that did David's play. Have you seen that guy's shit? It's good. Oh, were you looking at the book I got you? Yeah. It kind of looks like me, right? A little bit? No. What do you mean? This totally looks like me. Okay. You know, I know that you meant what you said the other day. I didn't. I think you misinterpreted what I was saying. No, I didn't. I know exactly what you were saying. No, look. You know that I look up to you. Sure. I mean, I think about you constantly. And do you wanna hear something fucked up? What did you do? One day I kind of let my curiosity get the best of me. And so I set up an account and we had a session. You know, I said that I didn't have a cam or microphone, but. I can't believe you would do that. I'm glad I did it. - Look, fuck. - Ugh, no. You were so fucking beautiful. What the fuck, Duke? How many times did you do this? I mean, I don't know. I used a different account each time, but. That's so fucked up. You're wasting my time. I could be making money. Whose money did you use? I mean, it was your money, but. Oh, so you used my money to cam with me? I mean, I used our money, and it just circled, but look, I mean, let's go to the bedroom. I'm mad at you, Duke. Don't be mad at me. I'm really mad. I know you are. Don't be. Did you like it at least? I like it. I mean, it's fucking incredible. - I mean, you're incredible. - Yeah? You know, if you weren't such a jealous little bitch, then maybe I'd fuck you right now. Oh, man, my Lord of jealousy. For it is the green-eyed monster that doth mock... I really don't know what you're saying right now. And we had eyes and she chose me. Scarlet, hey, what's up? Hey, Jackie. Nothing, I was just thinking about you. You were? Yeah, I wanna come to New York. Can you fly me out tomorrow morning? Are you fucking kidding me? Why would I be kidding you? I wanna come. Oh! Yeah. Well, you don't seem very excited! No, no, no, no. I mean, I really want you to come. It's just like... What's that? I have no idea. Fuck. It might be Will or Larry. Those guys are up early. Hold on, stay on the line. I just gotta take care of this. Oh my God, I wanna see you so bad. Hold on, hold, hold. Hey, Jackie. So I'm guessing this is Joe's room? Yeah. Thank you. Cheers. So, I guess you don't actually live in San Francisco. Of course not. I've never even been to San Francisco. Why don't you take that picture of me? You said you wanted to get a picture of me? Here. Make sure I look cute. Is this good? - This angle is good? - Yeah. Okay. Oh my God. Well, so what are you gonna do? Where are you gonna go? What do you mean? I'm going to Paris. You are? With who? With you, silly. You said that if you took a picture of me in New York, that you would take me to Paris. Oh my God, I did. Yeah. Are you not a man of your word? No, no, I am. Scarlet? Are you awake? Scarlet? Scarlet? Are you awake? Nuh-uh. Okay, yeah, me either, I'm just checking. What time is it? Six. How'd you sleep? Not that great. Why? Because you woke me up like 10 times. I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm so sorry. I don't know, I feel like it's Christmas morning. - I can't sleep. - Oh my God. How could I sleep? You know, I was thinking, so like, once we get to Paris, we could get like a little temporary studio and we could set up a space for you to do your painting. And I mean, we could even have a place for you to do your cam work if you wanted to continue doing that. Okay, I mean, that sounds nice. What are you gonna do about your job? My job? Oh, I can totally do that online. Yeah, yeah, no, I can totally continue my research online. Okay, okay, good. Wanna look at tickets? Yes! You know, we should stop by your place, maybe on the way out. I feel like you're gonna want more than what's in that little suitcase, right? You're not gonna buy me nice things in Paris? Oh, of course I am. You know what, I think I'm just gonna be like you and like, just throw out all my stuff. I really don't need any of this shit. Like why do I even have anything? Here's some chips. Here's some chips from 2005. Oh my God, you're throwing everything away. Yeah, I know, it's great. - I feel so fucking liberated. - Yeah? Oh, look. This is great. I'm glad I kept a whole collection of straws. This is for all the milkshakes that I didn't make. You find anything? Uh-huh, 2:30 direct flight. Oh my God, incredible! Yeah. Let me give you my debit card. No, that's okay. It's my treat, babe. - No. - Yeah. Okay, so listen, why don't you just finish up here. Okay. And I'll wait outside. Just need to get some air. - Okay. - Sure, thank you. Of course, of course, boo. I'll see you. Wait, let me little run with you. I wanna go to an ATM around the corner. I feel it'd be good to have some cash for the airport. Okay. Yeah, that's a great idea. I just have one really important question for you. So, do you think we should make love here or wait until we land in Paris? Because I can totally see the pros and cons of either situation. It's like, it could be really fun to wait, but at the same time, like, why wait at all, you know? Actually I think we should just get back in there and get to it. What do you think? No, no, no, insufficient funds? What the? - No, no, no, no! - Yeah, that's what you get, - you fucking pervert! - Wait, wait, wait. Open up! Ah! Whoa, that was fucking wild! Baby, you did the right thing. You handled that like such a professional. I mean, how'd you get on his private cams? Did you have to log in front of him or what? I mean, wow. You did such a great job. I'm so proud of you. That was not easy. Did you have to have sex with him? No. Woo! All right, fuck. Woo! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Sir, I don't see an issue with the account. No, I'm looking at it right now. February the 28th, $10,000. That's a cam girl site. Do you know what that is? I can guess. Well, I'll tell you, it's humanly impossible to spend that much. I am seeing previous verified charges on the site. No, it doesn't matter what I've done in the past. I'm talking about this charge. That's a fraudulent charge. I need that taken away. I'm sorry, sir, but I can't take that charge away. What do you mean you can't take it away? I'm asking you to do your fucking job and remove a charge that I didn't make. Sir, I cannot take it away. But I didn't make the charge! That's a crime against me. Sir, I see that you okayed charges to that site on the 27th, the 26th, the 25th, the 24th, the 23rd, the 22nd... Give me the news, man. Tell me, tell me, tell me, how we doing? Hey man, can you speak up a little bit? I can barely hear you. Dude, I lost it. We lost it. What do you mean you lost it? What do you mean? You lost it all? I thought we were gonna talk about this before you did that? Yeah, I know. Well, what's left? I mean, there's nothing. There's nothing left? Fuck! Hey, Joe. Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot! Oh. So fucking dumb. I'm such a fucking idiot! How the fuck did I let you do this to me? Where's that money? Where's the money? It's gone, Jack. Well, then get outta here. No, I don't want to. No, I said get the fuck outta here. I don't want to. - Please don't make me. - Get the fuck outta here! - Get the fuck outta here! - Please don't make me. Do you hear me? Get the fuck outta here! Get up! I can help you get some of it back. No, no, I don't need some of it back! I need all of it. Are you gonna get me that money back or what? Hello? What are you doing? Get up, get the fuck outta here! Jack. Please. You told me you were rich. I'm not rich. What about See Stream and the investors? I made that up. You believed me about that? You thought I had people working for me? That's so dumb. You said that, Jack! I wanted you to like me, so I told you I had a good job! Okay, well, you lied, and this is why you're in this predicament. No, I'm in this predicament because you and your boyfriend stole money from me! Not to mention, you broke into my house. I didn't break into your house. You're also a stalker. What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't break into your house. Jack. You broke into my house and you checked your fucking emails on my computer. Like, who the fuck does that? Who goes to someone's house, breaks in, and then checks their email? Like, what were you thinking? Oops. Yeah, oops is right. You're fucking deranged. Actually, I'm gonna call the police right now. Oh, you think that's funny? I'm gonna get the cop... You're not gonna call anybody. - Oh, absolutely. - No, you're not. I'm gonna get a uniformed officer down here. - Oh, yes! - And they're - gonna arrest you. - Sexy uniform! - Call 'em. - Yeah! Yeah, let's get 'em over here. Yeah, let me do it. - Let me do that. - Call the boys. - What is it again? - Yeah, call 'em. Is it still 911? Let's see. - I'm gonna do it. - Okay, do it. Oh my God, I can't wait for you to do it. Yeah. You better really start begging. You might not like the outcome though. You might not like the outcome. Oh, really? I might not like the outcome? Yeah, you might not like it. I actually think I am gonna love seeing you in handcuffs. Jack, the only person that's gonna be in handcuffs is you. What's your real name? I know it's not Scarlet. It is Scarlet. I like Scarlet better than my real name. Can we fuck? Just once? - Just once? - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Are you gonna kiss me? - Okay. - Yeah. Fuck. Oh, fuck. What's the matter, you got whiskey dick or something? I don't know, I don't know what's happening, I'm sorry. What am I gonna do with that? I'm sorry. Nuh-uh. I don't know what's going on. I'm sorry. All right, I have an idea. Nuh-uh. What? - No! - What are you doing? It's not how the game works. Stay! Okay, so I want you to picture that there's an invisible line from here to here, and you can't cross it no matter what. And if you do, something really bad's gonna happen. - Understood? - Okay, yeah. Okay, don't move. Mind if I smoke, Jackie? I think this is a no-smoking room. You really don't wanna see smoke coming out of my big, beautiful lips, Jackie? Yeah. Open up. Now, are you gonna be a good little slave and get your cock hard for me? Gimme your hand. Now, stroke it. Yeah. Ooh. You're so close. May I spit in my hand? Uh-huh. - Oh, wow. - Oh, fuck yeah. Yeah? Your cock is really nice in person. Can you touch yourself for me? It's gonna cost you. I'll pay. Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Ah. Yeah. Oh, fuck yeah. Oh. Hey, this is Will, you've reached my cell. Please leave me your name and number and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Hey, Will, it's me. So listen, man, we're gonna get your son's money. I have a new plan. I'm with a friend of mine and she's, yeah. She's great, and she's gonna help, and we might have to wait a semester, but I swear we're gonna get it. Okay, yeah! Call me back! Bye.
