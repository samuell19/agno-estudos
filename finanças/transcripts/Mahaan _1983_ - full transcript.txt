- Hello Vikram. - Yes brother? Everything is fine here. Come down. Okay. I'll be down soon. Mr. Sharma, he is landing. I will leave now. Okay. Come on. So Vikram, we finally caught you today. So what if you've caught me? You won't hang me, will you? That is for the court to decide. You'll take me to the court but you don't know that... ...I have a friend called Amit who's a renowned lawyer over here. - He will take me out of the prison very easily. Do you understand? - Will see! Forgive me, Your Honour. The court had to wait because of me but... ...I was helpless. He's come, sir. I had told you my friend would come... ...look, he's come. Quiet please. But what's all this? Some evidence, Your Honour. And plenty of evidence like these are waiting outside the court to testify. Have a look at this child. He's 10 years old, Your Honour, and... ...I've just brought him from a nearby lane. This child smokes at a very young age... ...that too a cigarette filled with drugs. And this, this child has an ecstasy pill along with his tea. And this young boy... ...till the time he doesn't get to taste cocaine, his body shivers as if suffering from malaria. What do you intend to prove by all this? What I want to prove, Your Honour... ...is that these kids, till the time they don't get drugs, will commit robbery, murders and loot people! That means in the coming few years... ...this country will become a haven for criminals. Because of few such people... ...who are interested only in their own profit, are forcing these kids to get into such bad habits, should be destroyed. Who are those people? There are a lot of people, Your Honour. Right now, their leader is my friend Vikram. Who is standing in front of me in the witness box. What nonsense are you talking about? Are you here to fight the case for me or to put me in trouble? I'm not here to put you into trouble, my friend. I'm trying to help you out... ...from the criminal activities that you have gotten into. This is a conspiracy, Mr. Judge! This lawyer of mine has joined hands with the police. To earn a good reputation, he's trying to frame me. How have I ensnared you? Did I hook this child to drugs? And the others who are outside, are their lives so cheap? Your Honour! Every father has a dream that one day his son will grow up, and support him in his old age. The same is with our society too. Our country too has a wish that the new generation... ...will take up the responsibilities of the country. But until such a time that we have such people, who drive the new generation into the evil habits of drugs, the future of our country is doomed. What one should do with the enemies of the society, is your decision, Your Honour. That's all. Vikram Singh, as per the documents and evidence... Vikram. Don't misunderstand me, my friend. This punishment will make you a better person. And I'm waiting for that day. Janki, have you called Amit? Oh dear, he will be coming soon. Please don't move, your highness. I am sorry. Mona, give me my diamond necklace. My Lady... Good evening My Lady. Looks like you got done from court early today. Yes ma'am. - Janki, Janki! - Yes! - Oh, when did you come? - Where are you lost? Isn't that a beautiful necklace? If the Queen doesn't have such a necklace, who will? Thank you Amit. How much is this necklace worth? Some years back it was a few crores of rupees. I don't know how much it will be now. Don't open your eyes. Now you can open your eyes. This! This, this is the same necklace. It's Queen of Palanpur's... Yes. Didn't I tell you I would give you, a diamond necklace some day? So I got it. But we cannot afford to pay for this in ten lifetimes. - But I paid it off in this life itself. - Where did you get it from? From the market. - Where did the money come from? - From the bank. From the bank? But we have barely five thousand rupees in the bank. This costs crores. You think I've stolen it? I have paid for it. I have a receipt for it. It is in my coat pocket. Take it out. Fifteen hundred? You really scared me. I thought you brought the same one. Look my dear wife. If I were capable, I would adorn you with diamonds from head to foot. But what can I do? My wife doesn't allow me to fight false cases and I cannot lie. But this necklace is more valuable to me than that one. This has your decency and trueness shinning through. Like hell it is shinning. It is an imitation. So what if it is an imitation? It is very dear to me. This is your love for me. "Wherever I see..." "...I see your picture." "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "I saw my future in your face." "I'm living for you." "My entire life is for you." "Whatever is mine is yours." "Now nothing is mine." "My happiness belongs to you." "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "Without seeing..." "...without knowing," "we are attached to each other." "We'll never separate from each other." "Your feelings are like my handkerchief." "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "I saw my future in your face." - This is sheer cheating. - Yes. What did you tell me? I should lead a decent man's life being released from jail, right? I tried really hard. But these people play mischief with a decent man. Listen ask your friend for tea? - Good morning. - Good morning. Janki, this is my friend, Vikram. Sister-in-law, the thing is, we studied together. I studied and remained illiterate and he became a successful lawyer. - Please have some tea. - Will you have some tea? No this is not the time for tea. You tell me what to do now. Don't worry. I'm with you. I will talk to him. No, pal. There is no use of talking. When I told him I would go to you and you would take care of things, he swore at you. He said I have a dozen such lawyers in my pocket. And you know what else he said? Said, if you try to teach him the law, he'll besmear your reputation. - Really? - Yes, that's what he said. Okay, let's see how he does that. Where is he right now? - What is that NT, NT... - Yes, India NT House... Yes, he will be in that NT House. You do one thing, you go there. My aunty is leaving for pilgrimage. I will drop her at the station and come. I will come there. You go ahead, okay? - Mr. Rajan... - You? You are cheating Vikram by taking over his fields, land and house. What cheating? You were partners in the profits and losses, weren't you? Yes, we were. When you underwent losses, you shared them. But you did not give him his share of the profits. What profits? The prize money you got from having him arrested. That profit. What? And one more thing, Mr. Rajan, a man who can send his friend to jail, can go to any lengths to deliver him justice. Go to hell. Give somebody else these threats. I am not foolish and stupid like Vikram. That's for sure. A man who leaves the door open and stuffs cocaine... ...in statues stolen from temples, has to be clever. Anyway, the police will decide on your outcome. I will decide on the outcome, not the police. Put the phone down. Amit, Amit, what have you done? You killed him for no reason... No I didn't do anything... I just asked you to make him understand, not kill him... But, I didn't fire the bullet. You pulled the trigger in front of me and you say you didn't... No Vikram. I don't know how it went off... Okay, I agree with you. But seeing all this... ...getting your finger prints on the gun, who will believe you? - Do you have proof? - You Vikram... You saw everything, you are my proof. Are you not my friend? Friend! When you sent me to jail, you forgot about friendship, my friend. Vikram, I did that to make you a human being. Oh go to hell. The mother who gave me birth couldn't make me a human. How will you accomplish it? Go. Get out of here. I'll not run away. Jail is a dim place to be in. I've just come from there. It is easy to send someone there, but difficult to go there yourself. - Listen to me, go away from here. - No Vikram. I will not go. Okay, don't go for yourself. But think of sister-in-law, of your unborn child. Think about them. Go run. - What'll happen, now? - But Janki, I've no witness... ...to prove that I did not commit the murder. There's Vikram but even he is against me. Now what? - I'll go from here. - Where are you going? - Anywhere, but far from here. - I'll come with you. No Janki, you cannot come with me in this state. And who knows what I have to suffer. - I'll not allow you to go alone. - Janki, listen to me. - You cannot come with me. - I beg of you. Don't leave me alone. I will die without you. I cannot live without you, I cannot. Janki... Janki! Excuse me! Please move? I'm a doctor. Please move. Don't worry. Please get a glass of water. This happens in pregnancy. Please get a glass of water. Okay. May I have a glass of water please? Sir, water. - Where is he? Has he not come? He will be here. - The train is leaving. - You rest. He will be here. Janki! - No, I don't wish to live... - Janki. Doctor, why did you save me? I don't want to live without my husband. If he's been separated from you today, if God's willing, he will come back to you too. I cannot live a single moment without him, doctor. Janki, take this... ...remember your husband. Nurture him. Make him a good human being. And when you find him, welcome him with this gift. You've done me a great favour by saving my daughter. Else my soul would not have found peace even after death. - You are a great man. - Don't worry, you'll be all right. This wealth, this estate, I bequeath to you from this day onward. From today, you are Rana. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Where is uncle? - Madam he's in Garden house. - Okay. Congratulations! Bahadur! You unfaithful man, you have guts to do this? I'll kill you. Madhu, my child... Bahadur, you can go. I told him to do that. You told him? Yes child. Every year on this day, I punish myself with whip lashes. You punish yourself? But why? Payback daughter. My past does not let go of me. It's stuck to me like a scorpion. Uncle. I am a sinner, my child. I have committed a great sin. I left my wife and my unborn child and ran away on this very day. She drowned and I was watching. What wrong had I done to the society, that my life fell into shambles? What wrong had I done... Uncle! Enough, uncle enough! Even I have lost everything. My mother died as I was born, and a father within a year. If it weren't for you, what would I be? How would I have survived? I have forgotten my pain because of you. Can you not do the same? Can you not forget your wounds? Do you not take me as your daughter? Who else do I have other than you in this whole world, child? If it weren't for you, I would be dead long back. Inspector Shankar is here. So you are dumb? Give me the stick. Do you know what this is? Every criminal in India, calls it the Sulemani stick. Just looking at it, a dumb person starts talking... ...the blind gets his vision, and the lame starts to run at the speed of 100 mph. I just got it out of a man's stomach. Yes! He too was dumb like you. He couldn't speak. I put this stick into his mouth and gave it a push. The stick went into his stomach and he started talking. He told me everything. But he had to be operated till three feet. From the throat to the stomach. That's when the stick came out. What do you think? - Shall I... - No, no, no, please don't... Who else is involved in this business with you? No one... From which flight is the cocaine coming from Nepal to India? - What flight is it coming by? - Flight number 412 sir. - Who is coming? Who is coming? - Sir, Prem, sir. Porter, put the luggage in this car. - Give me this bag. - No I won't. Give me the bag. - Leave it else I'll... - Leave my bag, leave my bag... Stick? Catch him. Take care of this fellow. My bag, my bag... This is my bag. Collect it, from the police station. - Hey you! - Talk with respect, understood? You are teaching me respect? I want to make a phone call. This is a police station, not a five star hotel. Have you ever seen a five star hotel in your life? I own 5-6 hotels, where I employ people like you. If you utter one more rude word, I will forget you are a woman and... Then allow me a phone call. What rule is this that you imprison someone, and don't even give her the opportunity to save herself? Yes. Talk like this. Come on! Constable... Yes. His name is Prem. From Katmandu. On the 412. Grey ambassador, DLL 2314. I want complete information. Now you will know who I am. - Hey, go there. - I'm going. Who are you pointing out to? You are not an inspector, you are an executioner. Blank face. Shankar, what have you done? Mother, what are you doing here? You have arrested my guest. - Your guest? - Her name is Manju. I am Manju. Look mother, she has cocaine in her bag. She is a smuggler. What nonsense are you talking? She is the daughter of Nepal's Rana Ranbir Singh. How do you know? He has been corresponding with me for many months. His business has spread all over the world. Why would an offspring from such a family carry cocaine in her bag? I told him, aunty. But it didn't register in his brain. What are you contemplating? Release her. - How can I release her without a surety? - I'll stand as her surety. - You will? - Yes I will. - Look mother, that could cause trouble... - I am responsible for that. No mother, I will not release her like that. I need proper surety. What do you mean by a proper surety, inspector? I am Janki Devi. Famous sculptist, painter, BRKRI national award winner. I am a standing surety for Manju. Give me the papers. I'll sign. Amazing man. If you can't trust your mother, where do others stand! Constable! I'm sorry child. Come on. My son is very strict as far as law is concerned. It's all right, aunty. By the way, it's been how many years that he last smiled? Why? It appears he has forgotten to laugh and smile. Daughter, whose statue do you wish to get made? Of my late father. - Oh! You have his picture? - O yes. Who all are there in your family? Aunty, my mother died after giving me birth. My father died when I was merely one year old. My uncle has done my upbringing. He means everything to me. - He's truly a great man. - Is it? Yes, aunty. When you meet him, you will believe me. Here is his photo. Excuse me, I'll be back. - Hello. Mrs. Gupta? - Yes. How are you? - I learnt that you too are on Karva chauth's fast? - Yes. - Where will everyone gather? - At my place. To see the moon. Mrs. Jagdish too wants to join. - Mrs. Jagdish? - Yes. Yes, yes. I'll inform her. What's her number? - 39... - One second. 395846 okay. At least smile in your picture. Looks like you've had bitter medicine. Smile sometimes. It keeps up the health. Just a little bit. Little more, more... Oh, not so much. Your jaw will tear off. Little less. Yes that's right. - Child, who are you talking to? - Oh, no one. I was going to ask you, do you live her alone? - No, with my son. - And your husband? He, he isn't here right now. - Is he in the police force too? - No, he practices law. Aunty, you are such a warm person. But it looks like your son is like your husband. Not at all. I'm like my mother. I have nothing to do with that man. Shankar, you know I do not like to hear anything against him. The truth is what you have to hear. What did he do for us? What can I say about a man who left his pregnant wife and ran away. Who did not even think that the child would need a father... ...when he grows up. That he would need his shoulder, his finger to walk by! Did he think of what the child would feel watching, other's fathers and sons? He was compelled. He was not compelled, he was a coward. Shankar! Look mother, he is a criminal. And if I ever meet him, I'll handcuff him first, - then I will speak to him. - Shankar... - Where is he? - Who is it? Who are you? I am Gunda Petha Rao D Raghwan D.T.M.S. D.T.M.S. Day time murder specialist. But, what have you come here for? You are a lawyer, you save the murderer, so I have got this here. I have murdered her and got her here. Now you have to save me from getting hanged. How can I save you? To save you I will have to fight your case in the court. I do not go to the court, you will have to save me here itself. I don't have time to go to the court because I want to commit another, five murders and get their corpse here. Five murders? Please find some other lawyer I don't have time. Mr. Shastri... Yes boss! Sir, he is a lawyer too he will fight your case because I lose all the... ...cases that I fight. Ask him to fight your case. Only you will save me. Or else if this gets close to your neck then your head... ...will go flying on that playground outside. And those boys will play with it... - ...like a football. - No... Janki, Janki. Save me, Janki. Please forgive me. What is the matter? What happened? Janki. He wants to kill me. Save me. No, please don't hurt him, please spare him, I request, I beg... Mother, what are you doing? - Mother? - Janki this is the voice of... Guru. Not only the voice but the face also belongs to Guru. Mother, here after so many efforts I prepared this drama. You just ruined it. - This was a drama? - Yes. - And whose corpse is that? - Corpse, corpse? Corpse, come here. - Hey come here! - Yes! - Who is she son? - I am the heroin for his new play. Tara! The star of tomorrow, she is Megha. This is called art, acting. - Now I shall get out the actor from you. - Mother save me, mother... - Save me mother! - Move Janki! What are you doing, your son has grown up now, still you beat him. If I don't beat him he will ruin my reputation. Waster, joker, good for nothing. Give me a chance to work, give me more thousand rupees. And then see what I do. I shall write such a play that the whole world will appreciate. I shall become such a famous actor... ...that the young, the old, male, female, the earth and the skies will say, ''look a simple lawyers' son...'' Quiet! - Is the king of acting, a simple lawyer's son... - Quiet! Is the king of acting. A simple lawyer's son.... - I will not give you a single rupee. - One minute. - What did you say? - I will not give you a single rupee. - You'll not give me a single rupee? - No. - You will not? - Never! Mother, if I am not able to play this drama, I shall kill myself with this axe. No, no son please don't do that. Why are you playing with the life of my son... ...for just more thousand rupees. This actor doesn't know the reality of life yet. If that is the case, I am killing myself... No, my son, please give him the money... I beg of you. Why are you making me a barren woman? What nonsense is this? He is acting and you believe him? I will bring the money. Mother, you are great. You have spewed an old dialogue and saved me. Why are you making me a barren woman? Wow! This dialogue has been sold in films... ...and drama's for the last 100 years. "Hey Gadku!" "Oh Pandya!" "Hey Dhondhya!" "Hey Gadhauprasad!" "Mr. Amachan!" "Hey Mr. Bicchu!" "Hey Mr. Badbad Singh!"

Such a bad performance, so disrespectful. You're an arrogant father. Disrespectful boy! Are you making fun of me? Forgive me, father, forgive me. Forget the past. Let's open a new account, okay? Give me 3000 rupees. We will produce another play. The unveiling of Draupadi. You shameless bugger. I will not give you a single rupee. Get out of my house. Go drown yourself in a fistful of water. - Mother... - What happened my son? Look mother, this insensitive man is driving a great artiste to suicide. Let your enemies commit suicide. Your mother is still alive. That's it mother, it is only for these dialogues that I am alive. - Else this Gengis Khan... - Look, look at him... I am watching everything. Come here. What were you like before we got married... - She convinced him. - Shut up. Mr. Rai has asked for a reply for his granddaughters proposal. Oh! I'd forgotten all about it. My dear, my child, I'm so proud of you! Oh! Change of scene? This means it is a conspiracy. My son, you are talking of Rs. 3000, I will give you one lakh. One lakh! This is definitely a huge conspiracy. No my son, there is no conspiracy behind this. I will get you a bride in one lakh. Oh! So you want to bargain my bachelorhood? Okay, I accede to your bargain. Well done my son, I expected the same from you. But I didn't expect this from you! Who is the girl? Uncle, shut up! Whom did grandfather consult before printing this in the newspaper? - Oh! You mustn't think like this. - You are advising me? You think I'm a mannequin at an exhibition to parade in front of people? Oh no, my girl, you don't have to do that. Just walk around and take a look at the boys. Just look at them once? I'll look at them just now! Once, twice, thrice and fourth time. Do anything my girl, but just select a boy for marriage. - Shut up! I will not marry! Not marry! Not marry! What did she say? She will not marry? Yes sir, she said just that. Did you hear this doctor? Says she won't marry. Why have I called so many people? To dance for my wedding? Okay, let her not marry. But go and tell her. If she doesn't get married... ...I will donate my wealth worth in crores, to orphanages. - Shut up. - But sir, please rest now. I am telling you. She will not get a dime from me. This is my last decision. Go and tell her. Okay Mr. Rai, you sit. I will explain everything to her. - What does she think of herself? - You rest, you are not well. - Ramdeen, take care of sir. - Won't get married... - Please rest... - Give me that pill... - I have a double degree. - But your face shows only one and a half. I am a florist. I will tend to you like a flower. Go and get married to another florist. - Are you a wrestler? - My father was a wrestler. Go and give a massage to someone. About me... - What about me? - Shut up. - Excuse me dear. - What is it dear? You are too short and thin. The doctor has told me that I'll become tall and stout after marriage. Then get married to some doctor. What do you think about me? My opinion of you is that your voice is very thin! What's your opinion of this voice? How a pigeon takes a letter to its destination... ...their wings are cut off with scissors by the ones in love. The answer is that the pigeon will take the letter in such a manner that, the message written on the wings, is ready to get cut for love... Applause! So? - Very nice! - Great! What do you think? - The voice is good. - And the face? It's okay, but the height is a bit much. Okay, so let's take this voice, someone else's built, another ones face etc. Put it in a box and shake it, you'll have the man as per your choice. What do you think of yourself? Have you come to find yourself a fianc?, or to buy vegetables? This one's too tall, this ones too fat, this one's cockeyed, just sit with us for 10 minutes, I'll give you all your bad qualities on hearing which... - ...you will commit suicide. - Be quiet. No. You be quiet. You invite us to your home only to insult us? Come here, friends! This is an insult to us. This is an insult to our manhood. This woman has relied on her wealth to make a monkey out of us. Before she fails us, let us fail her. All of us will get together and form a fianc? union. We will stand on a raised platform... ...and raise our voices against such proud and arrogant girls. We will burn their pride in ashes. Say labour... - Say fianc?s union. - Stay strong! Ramdeen! - Fiances union. - Stay strong! - Dictatorship won't work! - Won't work! Won't work! - Shame on Rita! - Shame! Shame! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! - Tommorow... - Will bring colour... Useless girl, chased everyone out didn't you? Made them leave after insulting them? I knew you would do just this. Always pleasing yourself. My wish will never be fulfilled. - I'll die... - Grandfather... But you'll still want your way. Go do as you please, but be warned. From now on you are no one to me and I am no one to you. Ramadin! - Coming. - Hurry up. - Come. - Move away. - Come. - Don't talk with me. I have brought you up with love and affection... ...and this is the result of it. My girl, don't be so stubborn. Have you seen your grandfathers condition? If anything is to happen to him what will the world say? That a granddaughter has taken her grandfathers life. Let them say it! Does that mean that I should be stuck with some crooked... ...old chap for all of my life? But who says you have to do that? You don't want to marry just yet, - but surely you can pretend to marry? - Pretend? - Yes act out a marriage. - I didn't get it. That boy with the deep voice? Tall... - The one who gave the speech. - That arrogant one! Listen to me. I've heard that he is a very good actor. He wants to produce plays all the time. So what am I to do? But he doesn't have money. If you offer him some money, he will pretend to be your husband. That'll appease your grandfather. Then you can get married to the boy of your choice in your own time. A hired husband? What did you say? A hired husband? Impossible, impossible... Thousands of girls queue up outside my house like in a ration queue, to make me their husband. And you instead of making me a husband, want to make me this! Go away, go away from me. - But at least listen to me... - Never, never... I will put an iron rod from one ear to another, but I shall not listen to you ever. You have the audacity to turn an artiste into a hired husband? This is enough to drown myself in a fistful of water, mother... Listen... Damn! He is really arrogant and I'm helpless. Look I'm in a great difficulty. I had come to you with great faith. I have come to you with a request. Request then, what do you have to say? I am anxious to know your request. Look my grandfather will disinherit me... - I'm happy... - He'll throw me out of the house... - No problem... - And he doesn't have a good health... And you want to cheat him. And that to by using an artiste... This, hold this, this calls for drowning once again... Listen, he is a peculiar. What shall I do now? I cannot decide. What is happening? He was in the pool a while ago, now he is out? Is he a man or a ghost? Listen, wait... Tell me! - What is it? - What have you thought about me? I have thought that thinking of this is an insult to thinking, - and so I have stopped thinking. - Please, my grandfather is very ill. And you have the illness of stubbornness. Boss... What are you saying brother? A beautiful girl is asking you so lovingly. Agree to her wishes. - Put away your anger now. - Is that so? Okay, I'll go by your advice. I'll ignore my temper, but you do know I have no time to waste. Hey girl... Sorry! Sorry! I am willing to help you out in your situation. Tell me how can I help you? Okay, enough, tell me in shorter way. You mean that right now I am in Paris, - Wait young man. - What is the meaning of this? What kind of a youth are you? You don't know what this sign means? Don't know! It means a boy should give a girl a free ride? - Where would you like to go? - Surajkunj. I'm going to dance at the fete. Okay here we are. Thank you, young man! Come for the show, okay. This old age... "This day comes once in a young age." "It is like a fire in fuel." "My heat is lost." "Whatever will happen, I don't care." "This day comes in a young age." "It is like a fire in fuel. My heat is lost." "This day comes once in a young age." "This day comes once in a young age." "When someone gets close to you..." "Will he etch your heart?" "He will wake up your love." "He will steal your heart." "He comes in my dream..." "...and if he comes in my dream, I'll be excited." "This day comes once in a young age." "The lovers are here." "They came with a big heart." "They have been intoxicated in your love." "You are in my dreams." "Love is unpredictable." "You can't escape from love." "This day comes once in a young age." "It is like a fire in fuel. My heat is lost." "My heat is lost." "Whatever will happen, I don't care." Welcome, welcome my dear! Come, welcome my dear son. I bow to thee, respected grandfather! Rise my son, rise. - You are welcome to my home. - Thank you! You have been blessed with a tall stature. If I jump, then also I won't be able to reach your height! Did you have a good flight? A person who will one day be burnt on the pyre, will burn, and will become one with the earth, and will be spread within the breeze, how can such a man be asked to describe his journey? - Oh! What great thoughts you have. - Thank you, thank you. May you live as long as the earth exists. And that an ordinary man as myself should prosper in your warm shelter. Oh! What a philosophical person you are. My girl, you have found a very good match indeed. It's true that I cannot understand a word that he is saying, but, he does sound very warm and pleasant. - Come let's sit. - Yes! Oh what's this? Why are you sitting on the floor? Come sit by my side. No, sir, I cannot sit by your side as I am not comparable to your deeds. The one who is comparable with you is... ...the one who can sit by your side. And the one who isn't your equal cannot sit by your side. Son, I really don't follow this equality of yours. It's best if you don't understand, why isn't it true? - Oh! Yes it is true. - So come, sit by my side. But... He's right dear, when the husband is on the floor... ...the wife being above him doesn't seem right. He is your son-in-law. Ask him to sit on the sofa. Oh yes, what am I doing! Son, you are the son-in-law. Sit on the sofa. As you wish. You sit there itself, child. I thought that because you have come from abroad, you must have turned into an Englishman, but I'm glad it is not so. The lotus grows in a muck, but does it change the lotus? Not at all! Acharya Bhishm has said that, man should live as a hair in butter, a net in the sea and a shield in war. Applause... What is the applause for? This is a home not a stage. Grandfather, the great Shakespeare said that the world is a stage, life is drama, and we all are actors. Death is it's veil. - Did he really say that? - Yes. Claps! Loud claps! We'll get along well. As smoothly as ice-cream! But grandfather, some people are out to melt our ice-cream! Who? Who? Who? There are many kinds of people in this world. People who melt this world away! People who make suffering people suffer more. Who don't let others get along and get hired people! - Hired people? - Yes. Who is the hired person? What are you saying, son? You're the son-in-law of this family. - No one can harm you. - Yes. Son, I want you to take over my entire wealth... - ...and business and let me rest. - Yes. But... ...what's the hurry, grandfather? There is, dear. Who knows about this life? It's passing away. It can end anytime. It can't, grandfather. We'll give our life to you, but never let you die. Bless you son, bless you. Sir, it's time for your medicine. - Who's she? - She's our family lady doctor. Oh, got it! The two of us, just two kids. Stay away from the wife, even if it's difficult! - Clap! - No, no, no. One shouldn't clap too much during rehearsals, grandfather. Let the show get completed, then there'll be applause! What rehearsal? What show? - Mr. Rai, I think we've spoken a lot. You should rest now. - Yes. Dear, take care of son-in-law. Let him rest. - Come. - I'll leave now. - Yes. - Come. You rest and I'll rest too. I've done it so easily! - So how was the first scene of my drama? - Bad! - If it's bad, I'll get thrashed. - Your style was so theatrical! As if you were doing a play! - Can't you act naturally? - Naturally? Beautiful! Come to the room, I'll show you right now! Lift the veil and show me the charm! You're so sweet! Mother! Shankar dear. You asked for juice and are sitting here! Yes, I'm sorry mother. What're you looking at son? Some old royal jewels have come for sale. I've to arrange for their security. - Kailash! - Yes sir? It's written that the deposit to bid at the auction is 50 lakhs. - Get the money deposited today. - Okay. We should get this necklace at any cost. I want to gift this necklace to Manju on her next birthday. - Simon! - Yes? Simon, look! Look at this necklace! Hey get that, get the injection... Simon! - Simon! - Tell me partner! Deposit money for this necklace. - This necklace... - Will to come to us. 100 percent. David. Put tow more officers there and every exit should have one. Your lying... Save me, is someone there, save me. Someone... He's got stuck? Call someone. Come here. Pull him. - Let me get the ambulance. - Don't leave me. Over there. Come. It's time for the flight. Simon hasn't come yet, see. - Look, we need to finish his game. - Shut up. - Vikram... - What happened? - Give me the necklace. - I don't have it. What do you mean? - But listen to me, they were chasing me. - Who was chasing you? - The police. - Then? Then I went inside there and put it inside that. Where did you go? What did you put inside what? There was a art gallery there. I put the necklace inside the Shiva statue. Are you mad? I have already taken the money for it. I will give it to you tomorrow, pal. - Do one thing. - Yes. - I'll go to Kathmandu now. - Yes. - I'll go there and convince Tom. - Okay. - You come with that necklace to Kathmandu tomorrow. - Sure. - If you don't... Shankar, the world will know that you have been suspended. But that will not be the case. This is between you and me. Now you can work in peace and find the culprits. Yes sir. Shankar the honour of the police department lies in your hands now. Don't worry, sir, I know what to do. One more point. The deposits made for the necklace, also has one person from Nepal. Understand? Yes sir. - Best of luck. - Thank you sir. Listen. I have especially bought this statue for uncle. Take it carefully. Bless you my child. May the good Lord protect you. Take care of yourself. Don't worry aunty, my uncle is great. They will get along so well... ...like they have known each other for years. He will remove the cob webs from his head. Listen, give this letter to my uncle, please? He'll be very happy to see you! - Okay mother, I'll get going. - Okay, son. Excuse me... Uncle is in abroad right now... ...but by the time you reach there, he'll reach Kathmandu. - Okay. - Excuse me. Please smile sometimes at least. Laugh, my friend. No, not so much. Your jaw will tear. A little less. Is this okay? Yes, it's okay now. Listen! Yes tell me. Hello. - Janki Devi? - Yes, speaking! There was a Shiva statue in your art gallery which I want to purchase. I'm sorry, but that statue has been sold. Sold? Please, don't do that. She's really sold. Who took her away? My son is taking it to Kathmandu to Rana Ranveer Singh. Excuse me. Could you show me your bag please? - Passport. - Yes of course. - Coming from Hong Kong, Rana sir? - No, from Tokyo. - You can take your bag please. - Thank you! Hey... - Excuse me, your Mr. Shankar? - Yes! Mr. Rana has sent the car for you. Please come. Welcome! Welcome! 'Oh, he looks exactly like Amit...' Are you Mr. Rana? Yes, I am Rana. My name is Shankar. Manju has sent a letter for you. Khanna! Okay, okay... Where is the parcel? This is it... I have been waiting for this parcel since yesterday. Yes, but I was to come only today... Sir, this is only a dinner set... Sultan! Sultan! Where is the real parcel? Real parcel? I don't understand... Hey inspector. Don't act too smart with me. Tell me. Where is that Shiva statue? You seem to know a lot about me. Don't talk too much. Tell me where the Shiva statue is. What's in that statue that your blood pressure is rising so rapidly? I am asking you for the last time. Where is the Shiva statue? I will count up to three. Answer me else I will blast your brains. One. Two. Three. What is this? This is the Shiva statue... How did this come here? I had brought a dinner set... Sir, this box has the Indian Airlines tag. But you came from Japan. Dad, this is the Nepal Airlines tag. Nepal Airline? But Shankar came from Delhi... Prem, the parcels have been exchanged. Else how would this parcel go to Shankar? - Anees! - Yes sir. - You go to the airport and find out. - Yes sir. Come! Sir, look at this picture? Janki... Amit's wife... 'Yes...' 'Good evening...' That means. Shankar is Amit's son. And he has come as a guest to Mr. Rana's house. Simon. Search every corner of Rana's house. - Kailash! - Yes sir! - What was that scream? - I too came after hearing it. Lord Shiva's statue had fallen here. Oh wow... What are you doing Queen Rita? Put off the lights at least. - You! - Give me a kiss. You idiot, what are you doing here? These hands are not for hitting, they are for loving. Shut up. - He is right. - You? What are you doing here? When a girl wears a sari, with a flower necklace, she belongs to her man, then she follows her man. That's why I say... "Half of the work is done, do the remaining." "Half of the work is done, do the remaining." "Let's turn this night into a nuptial night." "Put the vermilion of my name." "Put the vermilion of my name." "Half of the work is done, do the remaining." "Let's turn this night into a nuptial night." Wow, Guru, wow, you got her hooked... Shut up. Get out of here. "If I get a beauty like you, I'll die." "And if I die, what will I say to God." "If I get a beauty like you, I'll die." "And if I die, what will I say to God." "I don't care, if you get angry." "Never mind." "I don't care, if you shout." "- It is fine. - I don't care, if you get angry, if you shout." "I don't care." "Come into my arms." "Come into my arms, and stay relaxed." "Half of the work is done, do the remaining." "Let's turn this night into a nuptial night." "You hate love, come I'll teach you to make love." "The beauty has no meaning without love." "You hate love, come I'll teach you to make love." "The beauty has no meaning without love." "If the heart..." "...is lost in love," "if the heart lost in love..." "...everyone gets the meaning of love." "Fall in love." "Hail Ganges." "Fall in love and attain your goal." "Half of the work is done, do the remaining." "Let's turn this night in..." "Let's get ready for the nuptial night." You're taking advantage of my helplessness. You're bent on humiliating me. I'll stop this farce today. Maybe you've forgotten that you're just a hired husband. I cancel this agreement. Take your money and get out from here. Get out. I said, get out. Hey, hey, ma'am. Lower your voice a little. And control that tongue of yours. I'm an actor, but I have dignity too. Dialogues like get out and go away, I've used them many a times. If someone uses them with me in real life, I beat them a lot. I break their jaw and then they can't even talk! I respect you. So take this. Your Rs.10,000. A gift from an artist! Hey, uncle, what are you doing here? Come! You're used to living with people who are good-hearted. These are rich and heartless people. Yes. Who are you? Sir, I'm Shankar and I'm coming straight to you from Delhi. - From Delhi? - Yes. Tell me, what can I do for you? Oh, I'm so tired! She has sent a letter in your name. Manju... - Manju! - Yes! She has praised you. She must have felt sorry for me and said that. Else I... Sir, your dinner set. - It's for me? - Yes. That must have reached you already? - Who? - No! That, the Shiva statue. Shiva, Shiva... Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Pashupatinath! Lord you have put me into trouble. I am crazy about him. If it were not for him, I would be ruined. Ruin? I mean, yes, it is unlucky to lose an idol. It's a good thing it reached the right place, sir. But how did the luggage get exchanged? In the air... - In the air? - I mean at the airport. This airport staff indulges in work blindly. They send goods meant for one place to another, sir. - Kailash. - Yes sir? - Look, this Mr. Shankar is our guest. - Greetings. - Get the guest room opened for him. - Yes. Please go with him. You will dine with me. - I will eat pure vegetarian food, sir? - Okay. Good day. Sir, I have brought some paintings for you too, sir. Beautiful paintings. Manju has sent these too. Very beautiful. There are more... Take this! This picture with you... This is my mothers. - Mother? - Yes sir, my mother. Is she, is she alive? Of course sir she's alive, hopefully... ...she could live my share as well. Sir, sir, why are you asking me these questions? Don't bother, you may leave. 'Janki, my Janki is alive!' 'I'm coming to you Janki.' Janki. - Who is it? - It's me Janki. You... Janki! You! Janki! Come on Janki, I've come to fetch you, let's go. Halt. Inspector you! Yes, me... I have a warrant for your arrest, here you may read it. But inspector, I have just met my wife after a long spate. First you have to deal with the law. No inspector, today nobody will stop me! - Wait! - No! - Come on Janki. - Stop or I will shoot. No... Sir, sir, someone has come to meet you. Yes inspector. People here seem very quick. They recognize people from their smell. Now that you have recognised me... ...I may as well tell you the rest. I am Inspector Shankar and I have come here to investigate something. Investigate what? Some days ago, a necklace worth crores was stolen from India. So? You too had deposited money to bid for it. Yes, I had. So? Can you tell me where the necklace is right now? What are you trying to say? That I have a hand in the robbery? The rich use their tongue not their hands. The small fly steal on their command. So you mean to say that I am some underground operation chief? I am not saying this. You are accusing yourself. I have no time to listen to your loose talk. You may go. Please. Very well. Mr. Rana... ...this statue here? Why? What is so special about this statue? Special... ...a lot of people are in want of this statue. Actually we worship the Gods in these statues. But these days, smuggled goods are to be found inside such... Mind you tongue, inspector. I'm sorry! By the way, how long have you been in Nepal? 25 years. 25 years? That means you have come from some other country into this one. The fact that you speak such good Hindi, it is obvious you belong to India. Yes, I had come from India. Satisfied? Now please leave. But... I still have some more questions for you. But I am done with my answers. Yes but I still have questions. Inspector, you have no law that says, that you can force me to answer your questions. You know a lot about the law. Were you a lawyer before? Inspector! I remember. 25 years ago, there was a good lawyer in Bombay, who committed a murder and ran away. And he hasn't been found yet. Look inspector. Allow me to talk, Mr. Rana. As per the descriptions, you match him very well. He too was tall like you. You too are tall like me. So can you not be the murderer? You have stopped practicing, but you still think like a lawyer. Look Mr. Advocate... I mean Mr. Rana... This is 25 years old. And I was not born at that time. But you were. And you are the same age as that man 25 years ago. Shut up and get lost! Okay sir! - I will see you another time. - That time will never come. Whether that time comes or not, Inspector Shankar will certainly come. Get out! Thank you so much, God. By creating men... ...you've done the world a great favour. Actually, a girl like you should never get married. Aunty! But you used to say that a woman is incomplete without a man. And that I need to get married. You need to be married? Yes. Need to? Then I will go and tell your grandfather right away. Oh no, no... Grandfather will print it in the papers again. And once again dozens of suitors will come and stand in a queue. - And then I... - Then who will you get married to? - That, that, Guru... - But he is tall... - Will do. - Like a light pole... - Will do. - A palm tree... - Will do. - He is so arrogant. Will do, will do, you see I love him... Love him! My ex-father-in-law, give your ex-son-in-law blessings... ...for he has just come from being freshly married. Very well done, my son. Bless you. May you be married forever. What... Where? How dare you. You got married again while I'm still around? I will empty all these bullets into this witches body. Wait child. I will take care of him. What did you say? You got married? How can you get married again, when you are already married to my granddaughter? What granddaughter? What marriage? Your granddaughter can never be married. She can cheat you but she cannot marry. Applause! Stop it! And listen... Guru! That was not a marriage, it was a drama. - A drama? - Yes a drama. A drama which was filled with, deceit, trashy, tricky, sham, cheating, corruption. I was given money and brought here. I was made into a hired husband... ...and I was introduced to you. - Oh my God! - Shut up! There is still more to say, but now... But now I cannot be a hired husband anymore. I have become this girl's husband. - Tribhovan! - Das! - Triloki nath! - Verma! - Maithili Sharan! - Gupt! - Sumitranandan! - Pant! - Lajja Shankar! - Jha! No, no. You cannot do such a thing. Cannot do this? What are you talking about, madam? I have already done it. Become husband and wife... I just came to tell you, take your blessings... - No you are my husband... - Husband? Grandfather, did you ever see us together? Did you ever see us holding hands? Forget holding hands... Did you ever see us smile and speak to each other? - Stop it! - Please carry on! - Guru! - Yes! - Tell me the truth. What is it? - I'll tell you grandfather. This marriage was a drama to keep you happy. If I spend a few more days with this girl, she would've gotten a child on hire, - and said the baby is ours. - All this is nonsense. - Shut up... - Nonsense! I have understood everything. You have cheated me. I'm no longer capable of facing the society. You've ruined the respect of this family. Death is better than this. Hey Lord, I don't want to live anymore... Take me into your arms. - Mr. Rai! - Sir! - What happened? - Sir! - Mr. Rai! - Grandfather! Sir, sir! I am very sorry! No grandfather... What have you done? You have killed my grandfather. Could you not wait a little longer? Could you not keep your mouth shut? I wanted to tell grandfather everything myself. That all this was a drama. That I will get married and have a family. You? Have a family? Why? Am I not a woman? Can I not love someone? I'm sorry, but I have to say this. From the look of your face, it doesn't look like you are capable of having a heart or loving someone. Yes! Yes! I am a stone. I have no such thing as a heart. Until today, everyone has been scared of me. - No one has loved me. - And when have you loved anyone? Ask yourself. What did I tell her? I love you. And was going to tell grandfather... This is what I wanted to hear! Applause! Grandfather, you are alive! If you can act, can we not? What do you say? - Yes Gurunath? - Yes, grandfather. I am your father's father. I have brought you up from childhood. I understand you very well. Gurunath, I delivered the dialogue well, right? What, grandfather? That, husband on hire... ...kids on hire, you forgot all that! Oh, yes! Maybe I forgot, but I got the work done! Grandfather, there's one more mystery left to be unraveled. Your grandfather never had nor has any heart ailment! - When you're not with him, he eats to his heart's content! - Grandfather! - You're happy now, right? - Oh, yes. Then come, let's get you both married lavishly. Grandfather but she? She? Tara, Tara my wife. My lawful wife! Guru's hired wife! - Who is this now? - Hey, tell him about me. Yes, sure. Grandfather, he is the director of my charade. - Oh you, scoundrel! - Grandfather. Grandfather. "Fire the bullet and take my life." "Fire the bullet and take my life."

Mr. Rana, trunk call from Delhi. - From Delhi? - Yes, sir. Yes connect me please. Hello... May I speak to Shankar? You! - Who is speaking? - I'm his mother. He's been gone for the past many days. He didn't write to me or gave me a call. And it's his birthday today. May I speak to him please? Hello! AMIT'S WIFE: Hello! - Hello! - Janki! Janki! Who is this? It is me... ...me! Time has separated us so... ...that we can no longer recognise our voices. Janki, I am your Amit. Your unfortunate husband, Janki. Hello! Hello! Why are you not speaking, Janki? Janki, believe me, it is me. "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "I saw my future in your face." "I'm living for you." "My entire life is for you." "Whatever is mine...."

"We'll never," "separate from..." "...from each other." "Your feelings are like my handkerchief." "I see it." "Wherever I see, I see your picture." "I saw my future in your face." Janki! Janki! You... How are you? I am all right. Are you okay Janki? Yes... Have patience! Don't cry. Forgive me Janki! I have not done... No, don't say that. God has listened to my prayers. I found you again. I want to see you... - Janki! - Yes! I am coming there... Uncle! How come you're here? No message, no phone call? No, I wanted to surprise you. Why, everyone's surprising me today? Where's Shankar, uncle? It's his birthday today. - Yes, I, too, found out a while ago. - You? Yes, dear. His mother called. Really? Janki aunty had called? Yes, that... Dear, can I give you a surprise, too? Your Janki auntie's husband, that unfortunate man is me. Shankar's my son. What, Shankar's your son? Does he know that you're his father? No, Manju, he doesn't. - Uncle, I'll tell him about this. Please. - Okay. - Manju. - Yes? Come here, come here. Yes, uncle. All I hear from you is Shankar? Why is that so? Uncle, there's nothing to it. Uncle! Uncle, please! Oh, that's the case. What's there to be so shy about? Let me see you. Let's go. Shankar must be downstairs. Shankar? Shankar dear? Shankar! Shankar! Shankar, what's this nonsense? What are you doing, Shankar? Shankar, move the book away. Move it away, Shankar. Shankar! Doomed. - Uncle he... - Shankar... - No uncle. - What are you saying? It is not him. You sent the letter with him. I had given a letter for you but not to him. Uncle he is a goon, cheat, a smuggler. He once trapped me in Delhi. Bahadoor? Ask him who he is. Who are you? Tell me! Who are you? Say it! Say... I will tell you who he is. I will tell you who he is. - This is my son. - Daddy! You? Vikram! I respect your memory. You have recognised me with my beard after 25 years. Great! You live over here as Mr. Rana, don't you pal? You have collected a lot of wealth, haven't you? Tell me... - ...where is my share of the loot? - Yours? Yes, the one from the diamond necklace... - Diamond necklace? - The one in Shiva's statue... Great, pal. I don't know! He knows nothing. Doesn't know anything? He doesn't know anything? You don't know? Mac! Come on. - Listen, you're Mrs. Janki, right? - Yes. - There's a car for you. - Okay. - He didn't come? - He? Oh! Your husband? He has gone away. What do you mean? Who are you? - You will know soon enough. - Stop the car. Okay. We'll stop it. Stop the car, stop the car... Yes! Stop the car! Stop the car! Sit down, sit! - Drive fast! - Stop! Stop! Will you sit or not? - You keep driving! - Leave my hand! Catch hold of her! Shankar. - Son, you're here? - Son. You are getting married here and you didn't even care to tell me? You must've mistaken something. I am not your son. What are you saying? I can't recognize my own son? One moment. You are really mistaken. You are not my mother. Yes, son. Why would I be your mother now? When fate can take my husband away from me... ...it won't be too surprising if it takes away my son as well. - But keep one thing in mind, Shankar... - One minute. One minute. You have really misunderstood something. My name is not Shankar. It is Guru. And this is my mother. This is a lie. This is our son Guru. You are unnecessarily troubling us. First of all you have snatched my son away from me... ...and then you tell me that I'm mistaken? You? The doctor? Doctor. Do you remember 25 years ago you were there for his delivery... ...you told me that I have to keep myself alive, to take care of my husband's child. They are snatching my child away from me. Tell them the truth. Tell them this is my son. Doctor? Why are you quiet... Doctor. Say something, doctor. Why are you so silent? The auspicious moment is passing by. Take this mad woman away from this place. Mad? I am mad? I am not mad. I know my son very well. I am his mother. You can't snatch my son from me. Leave me. I am his mother. Stop it. Leave her. Tell me what the problem is. Sir, these people are snatching my son away from me. You are like a father to me. I swear upon your feet, this is my son. Don't cry, child. If this is your son, no one can snatch him away from you. Doctor, this woman's tears state that she is telling the truth. And I want to hear that truth from you. Mr. Rai... Keep quiet, I want to hear it from the doctor. Answer me doctor. Answer me! Mr. Rai, she is Guru's real mother. No. You are joking. This is my mother. No. This is your mother. If you don't believe me, ask your father. Nirmala. Yes sister-in-law. When you came to my hospital for your delivery, you once again had a still born child. And Janki had given birth to two boys. - Two boys? - Yes. And sister-in-law, before you gained consciousness, brother came to me. 'I have heard that a woman has given birth to two babies here?' 'Yes.' 'And she has still not gained consciousness?' 'If you wish, you could give one child to...' 'Brother! No. It cannot happen. I'm a doctor. Not a thief.' 'Nirmala, this is not a robbery, it is a favour.' 'It is a doctors duty to save a human life.' 'You can save your sister-in-law's life by giving her this child.' 'Nirmala, have faith in me.' 'I will keep this a secret all my life.' Brother had asked me to keep this secret. Mother! Your twin brother's name is Shankar! Where is father? He is right here in this city. Rana Ranveer Singh. I will bring them. - You take care of mother, Rita. - Yes! Sir! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Snake, snake. Don't bite me... If you bite me, I will die, let me go! Let me go! Get out! Snake you... You were there, how come you're here? I will sit, pray... I'll sit! Let me go. Let me go. Why do you come in my way? The family drama is at the end, I have to meet my father. I have a big drama company. I will give you a role to play. No, no, no. No need for that. Why do you get angry? If you don't want to be an actor, fine. Hello. Here, here. Yes. Salute sir, salute! I'm going, I'm going. I am bringing my one leg sir, I'm falling... Again, again. Snake, see, I'm standing on one leg? I'm standing on one leg? Don't bite, snake. Please, don't. I fell, I fell. Snake, don't bite. Here, I beg of you. Necklace! Oh? What is this? Take this diamond necklace. It's not a bribe. Take it. Take it. It left. Didn't accept bribe. Looks like a government man, government snake. Bye, snake. Went away! Mr. Rana! Sir! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! On the stage of life, I got a double role. Who are you? Where has this necklace come to you from? This, the snake sir gave it to me. Snake sir? Yes? That snake sir... He took me to this necklace and then went away. But who are you? Your are me and I am you. No, you and me, actually are me and you, because you and me have became we, we are brothers. - Brothers? - Yes. Brother! Yes, real brothers. Twin brothers. Of a single mother and a father. We share the same blood. It is his written word that sent you with mother, and me in someone else's cradle. If you don't believe me, hold me to your heart. Our hearts will recognise our blood ties. Yes, the heart did recognise, brother. Yes. The heart recognised it! Recognised it! What is your name brother? Guru! - Where is father? - Father? Yes Mr. Rana? He is our father. Oh! So I was right. Mr. Rana! Mr. Rana! Hey listen... Listen... Who are you? I am Mr. Rana's servant. A man named Vikram came here. He shot me. He was looking for a diamond necklace. He took Mr. Rana and the little mistress away with him. Vikram! I know where he has taken father and Manju. Guru, you take care of him. I am going to get father. And listen... Sir, please save my master. Please save my master. These are the same goons who were after me. Let's go! Sister Janki... Janki! Janki! Janki! You... Inspector Shankar? Come, you were missing from the action. Come... You've come at the right time. Meet your father for the last time. No Vikram. I am meeting my father for the first time. And will continue meeting him. What is that to me? You meet your father once, ten times, a thousand times. Just explain to him that he should not be stubborn. Let him give the necklace to me. I swear upon our friendship, I will let all of you go free. If you say the word, I will take on everybody. The wedding hasn't begun yet. Where are you going to take everyone? Shankar! My son... Father, do as I say. - Father, where is that necklace? - I don't know, son... Father that necklace isn't that important than mother and us, is it? Look, you and mother go there and bring back the necklace to Vikram. Until then, we will remain here as surety. Wow, an offspring should be like this. To save his parents he is sacrificing himself. - Prem! - Yes dad! Go with these guys. And if they act smart... I will finish them off... Let's go, Mr. Rana! Mother! - Idiot. - I will kill you. Prem! Ram, Mohan, Mac, cover. Come, come soon. Where were you for this long? - To get the necklace. - Where is the necklace? - With me. - Give it. No. I will give it to Vikram. If you try to act smart. I'll empty all the bullets into your brain and kill you. Got it. Give it to me. Now, move. Come on! Dad today is a big day, the victory is ours! I fixed everybody and brought the necklace. Very good. Give it to me. What happened? Dad, I had it. Hey you! You, useless, stupid... You cheat. You work less and talk too much. I told you, let me bring the necklace. Hold this please. Sir, here is your necklace. - Dad, we got it. - Shut up. This hair? A wig from a drama. I am Guru. Do you have some gum to stick the hair? No? Never mind. You are very intelligent. Sir, you are the only person to call me intelligent, else no one agrees to it. Tell me one thing. How many people do we have of the same face? Three, my lord. One father... ...and two sons. Okay. I will take care of you three later. First I will find out if this necklace is real or an imitation. - Mac... - Yes sir? - Get Lalchand, the jeweler. - Yes sir. And Prem, take good care of these two. - Come sir? - Yes I will finish you off now. Harish! What are you doing brother? If I sprain my back, I will be in great trouble. Dear! My sweetheart! Leave.

If you can understand that, understood? I didn't say too much, did l? Hey! Where did he go? - Oh! He is here. - I understood. Now I will explain what I have understood. Look behind you. - What? - Look behind you. Father... Prem, welcome Amit and sister-in-law. Now talk. Will you give me the real necklace or... ...wash your hands off your parents? Talk. - No. - Prem! Wait, I'll give it to you. Brother shoot... Got up from the floor, and the bullet went off. Then turned around, the bullet went off again, don't shoot. Bullets are over, now you can shoot. Baby, oh they caught me... From here and then... ...and this in slow motion. Run away! A head stand on the parallel bars... Jump onto the rope, hold on, hold on! Keep moving it! And that's it. Fire, fire! Caught him, leave me, leave! Run... He twisted my arm, boxing glove.... Hey, one here. Punch. Come on. Boxing, again boxing... Hit one, knockout! Where are you going? Hit him. Hit him, hit everyone. Hit one, knockout! Knockout, knockout... Stop it. Arrest everybody. Should I run too. Open the door... Amit! Today is your day of atonement, Vikram. Okay, now tell me, who is being finished now? - My fathers... - Just your father? - Mine too. - Yes, that's right. Shankar, please return it to me. Shankar, I cannot live without it. Shankar, I beg of you, Shankar. Shankar... Shankar! Shankar, give it back! You know I cannot live without it. Just as you can't live without this, the same way I can't live without knowing the truth. Which truth? Which one... Who murdered Rajan? Rajan was murdered by Amit, your father! Who murdered Rajan? No Shankar, don't, don't drop it, please I'll tell you. - It was me, I killed Rajan. - Why did you do it? To take revenge, revenge on Amit. Revenge? For what? Because he sent me to jail. Now please give it to me... Shankar, no... 15th of the next month is an auspicious date for both the weddings. Are you listening? I said 15th of the next month is an auspicious date for both the weddings. So why tell me, tell your sons... Shankar, Guru! - Yes father! - Yes mother! She's saying that both your marriages should be... Janki, here... Who is Shankar, and who is Guru? It will be clear in a minute. Rita. Manju. Yes! Yes, aunty. Recognise who is Shankar and who is Guru between them. We are unable to recognise them. The girls are stumped! Moustache! Hey what are you doing, they are real, not false ones! Leave it. Ouch!
