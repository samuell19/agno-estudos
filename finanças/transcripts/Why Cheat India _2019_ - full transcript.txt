'In this country, dreams are sold on pamphlets.' 'Be it losing weight in a week, or looking fairer.' 'But the country is swept by a wave of madness' 'when enrolments begin for Engineerin Medical and Management courses.' 'These enrolments guarantee fancy car flashy suits, and hefty salaries.' 'These dreams are seen by parents, but fulfilled by their children.' 'It's one big circus' 'and 'I' am its Ring-master.' 'And I mean it when I say that many have been dancing to my tunes.' 'But this one is special.' 'Trapped in the quagmire of his father's dreams.' 'This is Sattu.' 'Aka Satyendra Dubey.' For four years, he's been in Kota the hub of India's education factory 'serving a rigorous life-sentence in its coaching mines.' 'Sattu's father, Yogesh, has nestled him' 'in a rented apartment with the necessary amenities.' 'And his phone has enough balance jus to receive calls from his father..' 'or his elder sister, Nupur.' 'Sattu's landlord is his local guardian.' 'He ensures that Sattu doesn't have to step out even to buy a toothpaste. 'For this, he charges Sattu's father an additional Rs. 1000.' 'But this is no laughing matter.' 'Going out to buy even toothpaste can waste 10 precious minutes..' in which Sattu can easily solve three Calculus equations.' 'All these saved minutes, days spent in solving Calculus problems..' 'and the months and years, are all taking Sattu towards the moment..

I'll take that. - How much from the station till here Leave. Bless you. All good? Mom. The poor chicken had to be martyred because of you today. Why? Aren't you going to eat? Did you have a change of heart? Mum, did she cook it? You wish! She's only good for making small talk She's afraid of breaking a nail while cooking. Are you planning to feed your husband only frozen food? Not again. Remember what we agreed on? No discussion about marriage before I don't graduate. But you never listen. It's not easy to find a suitable groo Even if I start now, won't take me less than 2 years to find one. - Satt Mother, did you have your tea? Hey, hero! Hello, grandma. Hello, uncle. - Hello. Dad, can I... Yeah go, we'll continue this conversation over evening tea. Come on... - Let's go. Yogesh, you're eating chicken on a Tuesday? My son has returned home from Kota. Once he secures an Engineering seat.. I guarantee a special treat for everyone. From Nafeel. Sattu. Sattu. Drink this. Stir it well. You always leave the powder at the bottom. 'Just like the legendary Abhimanyu who broke through the quagmire...' 'Sattu is under pressure to crack his engineering entrance exam today.' 'The next three hours will decide' 'whether his years of hard work and effort were in vain or fruitful.' Walk carefully. Five minutes to go. Do a quick revisi Look, the bell has rung. All the best! Bless you. What happened to you? Nothing. Tried committing suicide just to escape studying. Silence. - Then? Then what? His father's a jerk. Got him fixed up and brought him here for the exam. No one will make any noise please. How was the exam, son? - It was okay. Will you pass? We'll see. Would you rather see the sole of my shoe instead? Dad, two questions in Physics were out of the syllabus. Everyone outside was discussing the same thing. You have to clear the exam. Dad, this isn't the only Engineering Institute in India. There are many others. Why do you always make a fuss about this? Come freshen up. - Listen.. This 'fuss' is how I raised you, my dear. And this is how I paid for your education. It's how I afford a square meal. This man who creates a 'fuss' is not your enemy, he's your father. Running a family is not easy. Money is the key here. We don't hail from a wealthy family. When I come home every day, earning a buck by hook or crook.. You never say that I am making a 'fuss'. Did you ever ask? Did you? And I am making a fuss, eh! You always fall sick when we need you No... - Just go. No one's ever died of a little fever. - My body is hurting. Listen. Do you know anyone else out there? - No. Let me speak to him. Why would anyone go so early to check the results? Nonsense. What happened? Nothing. You know dad can't wait. He's had his fourth cup of tea since morning. And hasn't even been to the washroom yet. He sent brother Sonu all the way to Kanpur to check my results. But Sonu couldn't go because he fell sick. It's a matter of one day. The result would've been declared in the news paper anyway. One day, huh. How are you so calm? Aren't you stressed? I think I didn't make it. Till date, dad has spent Rs. 575,000 on me. Even if I commit suicide, dad will recover that money from my dead body! Do you want a slap? Stop worrying about money. Are you worried about my dowry? Don't be. Stupid. So you're planning to elope and marry That's not a bad idea, Sattu. Think about dad. He won't have to spend a fat amount on my wedding. And people won't get a chance to dislike the food behind his back. Nice. And.. for this idea, I'll give you a treat. Treat. Learn to make flatbreads first! 2..33..50..68. Yeah.. Thank you! Thank you very much! My son's been selected, sir! Call Nafeel for the biryani. - Of course, sir! Of course! Where are you? What happened? - Wait, I'll tell you. Sattu did it! I just found out. Mom, you can forget about your diabetes today. Brother Sattu, you did it. Brother Sattu. Brother Sattu. Brother Sattu, you did it. Sattu, you were fantastic. Brother Sattu. Brother Sattu. Can you hear the hullabaloo, brother? It's confirmed. It's him. You're the pride of Jaunpur. He hung up. - Hung up. I hung up, Brother won't hang up. Now pay up. Rs. 5,100 for the achiever. Take a picture. And a sewing machine for the daughter Take a picture. Mixer-grinder for the sister-in-law. Brother Sattu. Listen, you guys need to move to the row below. But we've bought tickets for these seats. Look. Are you high? Or are you blind? Haven't you seen his posters around the city? This is Babban. No, no, he's just got admission in Engineering. And he hasn't watched a single film for years, so he's excited. Is that what all the excitement is about? My father got into Parliament. Do you expect me to dive into the screen and hug Bobby Deol? Get up. Get up! Hey. The children were smart enough to understand. Do you need a separate invitation? I am not getting up from this seat. I learned that from your father, the Politician. Let the children watch the film. They will vote for you when they grow up. Are you taking us for granted? It will be curtains for you even before the titles start rolling. Let's go from here. - Wait... Please enjoy the film. Shukla! Go up there. - Yes. I'll check. 13 and 14 are our seats. Sorry. Please come. Come on, we'll continue this show in the Police Station now. Enjoy the film. And by the way, Kajol is the murderer Come on. Thank you, sir. So how was the celebration yesterday? Don't ask, sister. You won't believe what happened yesterday. - Why? He really beat the crap out of those goons. And they were not some ordinary goons They had guns. But the guy was full of confidence. Hope he wasn't a goon himself. No, you didn't hear him speak, sister And, what if he hadn't shown up? God.. You shouldn't be going to such places Now don't talk like mom. So what about your post-graduation plans? Leave it. I am trying to forget about it. Don't remind me please. Give me a hand here. Sattu! Hey, that's the same guy. Hold this. What happened? - Hold this. At least lend me a hand... Take it. Thank you brother. Come, let's get something to eat. So what rank did you score? 287. And thank you for yesterday. Forget it. There's no sorry and thank you amongst friends. 287? You nailed it, didn't you? Mr. Agarwal's son in Shashtri Nagar cleared the medical entrance exam.. For which he got his son a 156cc motorcycle. But you deserve a helicopter! Can you fly one? 287! I see. How many hours did you study? Well. 5 hours of sleep. 6 hours in classes.. 1 hour for miscellaneous stuff and 12 hours of self-study. Which coaching center? B.K. Agarwal, brother. The one on Singhura Road. Near the Confectionery shop. What's the owner's name? Madan Chauhan? - Yes. That bloody, he must have robbed your father of a heavy sum. What does he do? - Service. I see. Any side income or is he struggling with his debts? Actually, he had to borrow a pretty big sum. What are his plans to repay the money I guess that comes after your placement, huh? Son, it's clearly visible on your fac The responsibility. Who else is in the family? An older sister. Old enough to get married. My mother, who's keeping sick. I just want to make it in life, broth Getting emotional? Need a handkerchief? You have a long way to go before you make it. But your family must be under tremendous pressure. I have a couple of options for people like you. I've helped boys like you before. You... Any intentions of appearing for Regional or local entrance exams? Your mind must be fresh. Will you appear for them? Now there's no need for that, brother Need. Human needs are endless! Opportunities come to an end. Dreams come to an end. Even bloody life comes to an end. But 'needs' never end. Well anyway, I thought you can easily earn Rs. 50,000. But let it be. Brother, what does one get 50 million for? Forget it. You enjoy your vacation, young chap. If you need help, call me. My name is Rakesh Singh. Rocky. And if you run into any spoilt kid of a politician next time, just take my name. Everything will be fine. After breaking the Provident Fund, Rs. 0.6 million to Rs. 0.7 million can be arranged from which the demand of the groom's family can be fulfille But Sattu's tuition fee will still remain! Right. Hello, son. Sit. Sit. Take these divine offerings from the temple of Kanthenath. Surely you can take these! Or have you forgotten God after clearing your Engineering Exam? Go on. Why were you sounding like an old scooter on the phone? Yes, sir! Coming. Brother, yesterday you said I could earn money.. And I thought that even I can make some money. Of course, you can. Anything is possible if you put your heart in it. How? Have you ever looked around in the exam hall? Ever wondered how many kids in there are just blank. Was everyone in Kota as smart as you? No, but they worked hard. Yes. There were a couple of guys who didn't study at all. There are many who rub the Engineering Lamp. But the genie only comes out for Aladdin! There are millions of candidates. And how many seats? Around 10,000. And, what about those trying for regional, or local.. Or anything they can get their hands on. Very less. Hard to say. Exactly. I help such people. Now, if someone answers the exam for these kids on their behalf... Won't that be great? You mean someone else writes the paper instead of the actual candidate How? Look, son. Let them dip into your knowledge.. And you dip into their pool of wealth. Father's debts, sister's marriage are all trivial. The point is... You're smart, I know. But can you be smart in copying? I see a 7-figure salary on your face in the future. That's nice. You'll definitely get a job, but after four years. I am saying this only because you sai your family's going through a tough t Look. I know you won't get into vices like buying a motorcycle or other debauche But you will have a girlfriend, won't you? Wouldn't you want to take her out? Have you heard about Newton's Fourth Law? No one loves a poor man. Understood? Congratulations, sir. Thank you. I am from Gyaan Bhandaar Coaching Centre. There's still considerable time before you join college. You must have spare time. If you can give some guidance in the evenings on Physics and Math. Our regional exams are coming up. Only two hours in the evening, four days a week. We're prepared to pay you as much as Rs. 15,000. I thought you'll easily earn 50,000.' You're smart, I know! But can you be smart in copying? So Sattu, what have you decided? You should do it, Sattu. It's not a bad offer. There's no harm in putting your knowledge to good use. And even I'll be relieved that my son's lending me a hand. But dad, I just received another offer today. And I wanted to discuss with you. Who? Who else did you talk to? Who gave you an offer? Good morning sir. - Good morning. Good morning sir. - Good morning. You do know tobacco causes cancer, don't you? Then double your quota from tomorrow and die early! You do look like you have a death wis Unless you don't show your colourful mouth to the client it doesn't prove you're a star, does Hello. - Hello sir. Did your father accompany you? - Yes. Very good. You think it's funny. Get going. So you are Rakesh Singh? I am Rakesh Singh ji. Here. From the Bengali Kali Bari Temple. You too. No wonder you found one so soon. It's God's grace I tell you. And your good wishes. God listens to wishes, but I take only cash. So tell me, is he okay. Or a dunce, like my son. Well, he cracked the entrance exam at first attempt. I'll be surprised when your son won't make it to the Top 10. Really! What are you saying? Is that even possible? Your son's just like you, Mr. Yadav. And that's possible. But you must have heard... Stand up! - That teachers ask questions in the class. Smart kids are called up to the board to solve equations. - Not you. I just hope your son doesn't embarrass you. It's a plethora of problems, Mr. Yada Your son is a bloody... Did you spit out your tobacco? Here you go. - No. Just half the amount now. And the rest when the results are declared. Along with a box of sweets. Here starts Sattu's journey of answering exams for others. "You are so successful." "You are like a rising star." "You focus on the money in your hand. "My sweat and blood for your dreams." "You are..." "You are..." "Yes, you are accountable for all my sleepless nights." "You are so successful." Bye. - Bye. "You are like a rising star." - Is it for me? Wow! - How? Where are you getting the money from? - Bye. Look. He's become the star of Kota. I've always had my eye on him. The coaching center students have become his fans. Hello, aunty. How are you? I am fine. How are you? - Offerings for you. All okay? - Yes. By the way, what's the current rate these days? The Tutorials in Patna offer up to a million to rank holders. What for? You mean you didn't get anything? Advertisement, uncle. Flashing pictures of achievers guaran business growth for coaching classes. It's business. Everyone's doing it. Do you have a passport-size photo of Sattu? Oh, yes, I do. Shall I get it now? Write your exams properly, okay. Do you want to pass? - Yes. We can help. - How? Go with him. - I'll note down the details. Would you prefer Mechanical or Chemic Ravi Arya. - Yes, sir. Kamal Rakshit. - Yes, sir. Tanuj Garg. - Yes, sir. Congratulations. All of you shift to the front row. Like a gentleman. And Champak Tiwari. - Yes, sir. Sayyed Abbas. - Yes, sir. Raghu Sharma. - Yes, sir. Please sit on the last bench. You have performed very poorly. Last row, flop stars! Front row, superstars! Don't worry about the last bench. I guarantee you we'll make him pass. - No, I don't want. What's the point of wasting your mone We'll help him pass directly. No, I don't want it. - But listen.. I am sure you're willing to spend at least Rs. 0.5 million. How much did he score in Class 10? 78%. And frankly, the future doesn't look too bright. But I can guarantee you an engineering seat. Without wasting a penny. Even if he does get selected, what th Now you're sounding like a novice, Mr. Tiwari. Till today, 15 of my boys are in different college campuses. They will be your son's seniors. "He stayed up all night to work hard. "Let things take its course." - You seem to be engrossed in studies From studies to ragging to placements they will handle everything for your Life will soar... Through the skies on autopilot. "You'll go for tuitions in a car." If you're guaranteeing me an engineering seat then I am prepared to pay you even Rs. 1.5 million. "You just make money." "This is not your cup of tea." If tomorrow I run away with your mone You tell a couple of people about it and make a mess. Name. Rocky. Balboa? He guaranteed you an engineering seat and you believed him. Any kind of slip? Maybe a cheque number? No. It was all in cash. Then do you want me to register a case for heartbreak? Well, he did promise my son an engineering seat. It's definitely a case of cheating. If we start registering complaints about breaking promises, then we'll have to arrest Politicians Romeos and Godmen. Leave. But why get into all that mess? We're happy with what we're doing.. And you should be happy being called an Engineer's dad. It's a business of human capital. These Einsteins are our human capital Just like one state buys excess power from another state.. To diminish its darkness. I use my Einsteins' excess knowledge. For spreading knowledge whenever required. Thank you. - Bye. Hello. Bye. Listen. Why don't you organize a family trip for me instead of my commission? My wife's keen to see Europe. Yeah, Yeah, that's fine. Another one of your last benchers was supposed to come. Well, he died! It was in the newspapers as well. He hung himself from the fan. You shouldn't make these meek children sit on the last bench. So now? Now what? The same old. A routine inquiry. The demand for suicide-proof fans will go up. A handful of people will make some extra bucks. You know what. Even if we put an "Injurious to Health" quote at the entrance of our Coaching Centr kids won't stop keep queuing up. And yes, I've made arrangements for those banking kids you'd asked fo Just meet them once. You guys are having a ball! And Rakesh sir, you're giving him too much credit. Not at all. Of course, you are. Mom and dad think they've given birth to gold. And you're just driving him up a tree I should eat something too. - Nupur. Shall we go? - Yes. Come on, Sattu. But... "It's the wedding night, so better look tip-top." "On the tune of this drum, sing this song hip-hop." "It's the wedding night, so better look tip-top." "On the tune of this drum, sing this song hip-hop." "Don't stop shaking that waist non-stop." "It's a romantic night to remember." "romantic night to remember." "So stupid is my beloved," "doesn't even hold my hand." "So stupid is my beloved," "doesn't even hold my hand." Now listen carefully. There's a banking exam coming up. What are they paying? Bravo son, straight to the point like a bullet. You'll be paid just fine, since this one's an outstation gig. You might have to stay overnight. Eat all you want. And the ladies are stunners too! "Stupid beloved..." "I can't sleep. Can't sleep. Can't sleep..." "I've lost my peace. Lost my peace. Lost my peace." Good night, brother. Come, sister, let's go. Well, Sattu will be leaving next month, but you must visit us. I often go to Kanpur, so I'll keep checking on him. And, I'll have to come back for your stale fritters and tasteless tea If you keep coming over, the tea will keep getting better. I am not stupid. I often travel for business. And now I'm even getting to know you. We'll stay in touch. Good night. - Good night. Are you dead? Get up. Brother, please amp up the air-conditioning. Rich kids enjoy themselves in college The middle-class is still worried.. Because their success is judged by a distinction on the mark-sheets. Wait a minute. It's Rakesh sir. Hello. - That's Shashi. Let him know if you need anything. Understood? Okay. Enjoy. Poor Sattu had the additional responsibility of appearing for others. After all, he had tasted blood; the blood called 'big bucks.' What are you looking at? Show me. Show me too! Hello dad. - Hello, Sattu. Please give Nupur the phone. - Wait, I'll give her the phone. How are you, Sattu? Hello, sent your birthday gift. - Okay! Take a look, daughter. Not again. I don't want to get married now. Should I order juice for you? Have this sweets. Have it, please. It is very special. Listen, you're going to Kolkata now, You'll be earning double. Brother. - Yes. Have you made the necessary arrangements for Sattu's Kolkata trip You know what, let's move to America instead. The trains here are too noisy. Doesn't matter where I am. But dad won't rest until he doesn't make me slog to death. I wonder what was so important before the Musical Nite! I was hoping to finalize a couple of deals here. You've always underestimated me. I would've taken care of everything. Of course. But you must first fix the problem you created.. By sending that text to the Nainital uncle's daughter. You mean the one where I spelt 'love' with a 'w' instead of a 'v'? Silly mistake. Uncle shouldn't have fed you so much of this boosting tonic. You could barely play a game of kabad But you're all ready to be a father! Brother, can I say something? Yes tell me. - But only if you don't get angry? Well, I can't guarantee that. I'll say it anyway. I think you should have a word with Sattu's sister. She's a girl, not some job or busines Do you want me to send her lovey-dovey text messages? No. You should tell her that you're not single. Or at least put a picture of my sister-in-law on your phone. So that she doesn't get shocked... Why don't I place your dead picture on my phone instead? Idiot! - I'm just saying.. Hello, father. Why didn't you just catch a flight? Now you won't make it to Jhansi before tomorrow. Sameer's flight will land in Gwalior in the morning. I've already arranged for a car. And also sent him the driver's number Fine, fine. But your brother and sister-in-law ar coming over for your sister's wedding It's important for someone from the family to be present to receive them. I wonder when you'll understand social etiquette. I'll take a look. Brother! - How are you? What took you so long? - How is everything? Everything is just fine. - Chandu! Sister-in-law. - The guests will be arriving soon. Brother, what did you get me? Bless you. The train was delayed by two hours, wasn't it? - Yes. Fine. Go on. Don't follow your father's footsteps. - God bless you. Did you get a mixie for me? - Yes, it's in the car. Look at that stubble. - Get the luggage from the car. Have you eaten? You haven't. Sit. Chutki! See. Now you look like a hero. Can I take the pictures of you? - They are taking a picture. Brother Sameer! Brother Sameer is here! Come, son. How are you? How are you, son? - Bless you. Hi. So good to see you. Nice to see you. Hey! Lovely to see you, dear. - How are you? Come on. - How have you been? I hope you had a pleasant journey. How are you? Good. Papa is always praising you. He is very hard worker. They have had a long journey. He has made our family proud. He's the one, he adds so much glory to our family. There. There. Yes. - How long will it take? Sameer is exceptionally brilliant. He was a state rank holder. Hello. - As is Rakesh. Rakesh was never interested in studyi Entrance exams must be difficult too. Roopali's daughter tried thrice apparently. Sir, uncle clearly asked for pink lights to go with the marigold flower Where in the world will I put this up now? What am I going to do with th Shove it in your mouth! Just put them up where dad asked you Don't ask silly questions. - Okay. It was clearly my fault. It's not an easy job to become a doct Business has picked up pace. But let's see.. Running Coaching Centres is hardly a profession. Sameer is a surgeon at John Hopkins. He charges a huge fee for extracting a single tooth. Yes, dad. But that's now. All this while, it's been brother Rakesh who paid for our wedding.. And now even Chutki's. And he's been looking after the entire family too. Bablu, come here! - Coming. What's wrong? Why do you look so stressed? It's just the work getting to me. Do you need anything else? Will I get what I want? Why? Did I forget something? There's your glass of water, milk, your undergarments, mosquito cream. No, it's all right. So... Have you been well? I hope you didn't run into any problems when I wasn't here. Well, Savitri didn't show up for two whole weeks.. So I had more chores on my hand. But she hardly does any work even when she's here. I've to literally stand on her head and give her instructions. The amount of oil she uses for cookin someone's definitely going to fall si But I bought her a can of butter and clearly told her.. That this should last an entire month or else she will be in big trouble. I also visited my mom. Everyone was asking about you. My elder sister-in-law fractured her leg. So now she's on bed rest. And you know what? My brother installed a bell next to her bed. Whenever she needs anything, all she does is ring the bell.. And someone's there to help her out. She's become static. And was advising me to go out. I told her she must be crazy. Who wants to go out in this weather? Yes.. The cops raided the hotel. But it's all settled now. What happened? Nothing, it was a raid and they took him in as well. I tried calling you, but you didn't answer. But then Sattu called Bablu. How much did they settle for? Around Rs. 10,000. Give the phone to him. Brother on the line. Hello. - I've been to jail many times. Once one of my candidates got arreste And while trying to free him, I got slapped by the constable. But you said I wouldn't get caught. This was not an arrest, son. Listen, there's a local tradition her Dial 100 to call the cops and pay 100 to drive them away. Understand. I'll hang up now. Come on, don't worry. Time for your exams. What's wrong with you? - What's wrong? I was on the telephone all night, and my eardrums are exploding. I haven't had the chance to even visit the washroom. And this place is filled with a bunch of idiots. No one knows how to make coffee. They gave me turmeric milk, and now my insides are burning. I am going to nap now. And then see you in the evening when I've freshened up. Why? - Why! After long, I'll hear you sing instead of mouthing expletives. "So what if we parted ways." "But I'm happy..that we met anyway.." "So what, if our paths separated." "At least, together, we walked a few steps." "We'll meet again at some point in life.." "and continue the unfinished conversation." "I'll be seeing you for today." "We'll meet again someday." "We'll meet again someday." "I know we're parting ways." "We'll meet again someday." Hello. - Please sit. This is for you. - Thank you. No need for this. - Come sit here. "Breaking your heart before I leave" "is not my intention at all." "A tear trickling down my face" "isn't more valuable than your smile. "Without parting ways, there's no fun "There has to be a rift." "It won't come to an end." "We'll meet again someday." "We'll meet again someday." "I know we're parting ways.." "We'll meet again someday." The real deal is about fees. And even parents only care about the degree. We need an empty plot of land. There's no need to build an institute either. I'll have it put on the list of Eminence even before it's built. And we'll receive the grant! Stamp paper, letterhead, signatures will all be mi And you'll handle the rest. Click the photo properly. This is not the right time. - Brother. Brother. Leave me alone. - Brother.. The wedding.. Attend the wedding. - Go from here. That's Uncle Ashok. The groom's elder uncle. Believe it or not, but he's a big gambler. What does he do? He's a manager at some Government Ban Tejaswani Bank, I think. Some branch in Lucknow. That girl in blue is his daughter, Jahnvi. What are you thinking? Let me do the thinking. You shouldn't think. I think you should double up your protein shakes. What do you mean? Mr. Ashok, please come with me. You can play all you want. I'll arrange a separate room for you in the guest-house. Come. Careful. Do you have money? - Yes. Come, Uncle. Come on. Let me help you. You can play all night there. You guys continue. Hello, Jahnvi. Please come, he's your papa after all Careful. Watch your step. Uncle, don't sit down here. We've to go ahead. Come on. I've heard that even you are a champion of the game. Not at all uncle, I am just a messenger carrying out orders. Not at all son, you're a maverick. Careful. - Be careful. Be careful with him. - Yes. Listen, I wanted to say... Thank you, brother. Careful. I am sorry, but I was about to call y Son, this is Sattu's father. Hello, uncle. Is everything okay? He's been rusticated, son. Please give the phone to Sattu. He's locked himself in the room and refuses to speak to anyone. He hasn't even eaten anything since morning. Where is Nupur? She's gone to fetch the doctor. Why don't you try talking to him? Uncle, ask her to call me as soon as she returns. I am attending my sister's wedding. But I'll call back soon. Don't worry, everything will be okay. Listen. Time for a family picture. Come on up. Wait, brother. Can't you see His Highness is on an important call? Yes, brother. I was trying to call you yesterday. I am attending my sister's wedding. You strictly said no messages. - What happened? They found drugs on him. On week days, he gives his college exams. And on weekends, he appears for your clients. He was under tremendous pressure. He would study all night and smoke joints all day. I told him a dozen times not to do it But he wouldn't listen. You had no clue. Then why the hell have I hired you there? What could I do? Someone must have complained. And the checking was done when you sent him to Kolkata. Call Shashi now! "They were supposed to lead the way" "but they showed me the ladder instead." "They were supposed to teach me to walk" "but they taught me to climb instead. "I couldn't touch the sky" "nor be one with the winds." "I couldn't breathe" "and the rest of you were applauding instead." Stop here. Park up ahead. - Come, brother. He's been put on drips. I tried to give sister Nupur money, as you asked me to. But she refused. "And now the book's torn." "And the answers are wrong." "And, no..." "And, no one's accountable for my dreams." I know you're angry right now. And you're right. I couldn't come earlier. There was a wedding at home. And the arrangements were my responsibility. Mom, dad, my family, and... My wife. All I had was a little understanding and a handful of dreams. For every ordinary person, the rest of the world is a star. The same way I thought about you. Wait a minute. Do you think that it's my fault that your brother's in the hospital? You think I brought him the drugs? Nupur. Sattu will be fine. I've got him a job in Qatar. I have connections. That's pretty generous of you, Rakesh sir. You made a small-town girl see the entire world right from her home. But I won't be satisfied with my old dreams. My father won't have to worry about his daughter anymore. And you won't receive any more unwanted text messages from me. Hello. Am I speaking with Mr. Rakesh Singh? Who is speaking? - I'm Shashank Shekhar. We spoke about the admission. We met at your coaching centre. I don't remember. Maybe you dialed the wrong number. But you guaranteed me a seat for my s You are mistaken. Are you Mr. Rakesh? That's my name, but I think you're confusing me for someone else? 'Are you Mr. Rakesh?' 'That's my name, but I think you're confusing me for someone else? What happened, sir? He's refusing to even recognize you. And it's difficult to trace the guy w appeared for your son's exam for him. No FIR. But yes, if at all we file a case for cheating... then you can get arrested as well. Me? Why me? Actually you should be arrested. Sir, what if we find the proxy guy? Don't talk rubbish. How will we show the connection? There is no way to recognize his face Even if that boy recognizes him... How are we going to prove it? We won't get a warrant. There's no paper trail or evidence. Except for a lot of promises and cash Lots of cash. What happened? - He was cheating. The money will be delivered by the evening. He's one of our boys. The money will be delivered by the evening. Don't worry. Here is your degree. Look after yourself in Qatar. Take it. His condition is not hidden from you. Keep this money. - There's no need for this. Keep it. Thank you sir. Bye sir. Brother, Sattu's father was calling. No need to answer his call. The Sattu chapter is over. New year, new batch, new Sattu. I won't get on it. - Come on.. Climb on it. - Come on, Brother Bablu. Climb on it. Come on. - Won't you listen to your beautiful sisters-in-l People climb on a horse, but you get to climb on a peacock. But, sister-in-law... - Come on. Don't touch me. - Let me help you. No. Don't. It's okay, Bablu. Just get on it. There. Happy now? You guys are embarrassing me at my own wedding. Give me your hand. Come on, let's go. What now? - This is your wedding. So you don't get to leave before you pay up? Pay! Why don't you cut out my heart? You made me climb on that peacock. Give her the money. - Come on! Brother, don't give them too much. - I don't have money. Wait. Take this. Here you go. Are you happy now? - This is just Rs. 10. You're such a cheapskate. - Okay, sing a song for us. Sing a song. Listen. Come here. - I am not a singer, let's go. This is just Rs. 10. Don't be such a cheapskate. Make him sit, sing a few songs. I'll go get the money. Brother, please.. - Come on, sing a song. Brother. - I'm coming. Come soon. Brother, don't leave me. I beg you, sister-in-law, let me go. What can I say? - Will you say something, father-in-l Go on, go on, but first make them happy as well. Oh, God. Even my father-in-law isn't on my sid You're the center of attraction today So just make them happy, Bablu. Sing for them. You think this is funny. Sing a song.. Who is it? Sir, I need your keys to move your ca Wait. Who are you? - Special branch, raid warrant. Look. Excuse me, I know Mr. Jatin Shukla. I am sure you do. Go ahead, call him. We'll get better headlines if the MLA comes here. Where do I go? The wedding is over. Now let me go. - You seem to be in hurry. Look at her, she is getting sad. Let me go. Brother is on his way, he will give you the money. This is my residence, what are you looking for? Sir, I think you are mistaken. We're just checking. Let us do our job. It's a raid. Let's see. Look you're just wasting our time. Sir. Very good. The house is registered under the name of Mr. Sampat. Mr. Rakesh has no connection to it. There's no point in telling me all th Tell the court. Bail is ready. What happened? Thank you. - Shall we go? Give me the car keys. I'll come later. I see. So now you're going to try harder. Cash? Cheque? Demand draft? Or maybe a gift? But your efforts are in vain, Rakesh. Because those who make an honest livi Are out of your league. I am not some politician to be afraid of your honesty. I respect those who make an honest living. It took you your life's earning to build your little home. But wouldn't it be sad to squander all of it for your son's admission? After all, it's not black money which you can give in a donation. Your son couldn't clear his Engineering exam twice. But you never thought of requesting your seniors to help out by putting pressure. And now, you're shuttling between pri colleges to get your son's admission. You really think they will give him an admission through means of your honesty? Can you tell them that your honesty is out of their league? Let your son appear for the Open Board this time, Mr. Qureshi. If he doesn't get the engineering seat this time then Mr. Qureshi, the look on your son's face shouldn't remind you that his father sacrificed his son's future on the altar of his principles But don't worry, nothing will happen. Do you think before doing your job or do you just dart off like a bullet I had a tight schedule today but had to drop everything and come here. But sir... - Please don't blame Mr. Qureshi. He's just doing his duty. I am sorry, Rakesh. - I am sorry. You had to take time off your busy schedule. Sorry. Come, let's go. Let's leave. - Mr. Qureshi. Meet me at my residence today. Just a second. Mr. Qureshi, I couldn't clear my medi entrance exam even in three attempts. And even if I had cleared it, I would've made for a pathetic doctor Because I always wanted to be a singe My younger brother is a surgeon in the States. Even today my efforts are directed towards making sure that my father has no complaints. All the expenses of my family... Wedding, reception, donation, prayer meets, dad's pacemak Are incurred in Indian Rupees. Not in Dollars. I know what your son's going through. Those without any kind of solution for rote-learning for exams are deemed useless by their family, relatives and society. And if I've to invent a solution that shut them up for good, then so be it. Good bye. Fine, fine, okay. Give it. Give it. Good. Good. What? Nothing. Nothing. Continue. Continue. Give it. No one passes without bribing. You too, son. Yes, pay up. My fee. I see. Pass the book. Sir. Did you already know the questions? No, sir. I see. Qureshi. What does your father do? Government job. Sorry, your paper's cancelled. - But, sir. Sir... Your exam's over. No help without paying commission. - But, sir... Leave. - Sir... Sir... - Get lost. Don't do it, sir. - I said get lost. What is it? You slapped me. I will get even with you. We have worked hard for it. What is this? Have you lost your mind? It will turn to ashes. - No. The entire exam will get cancelled. Get lost! Go away. What are you looking at? I am not joking. Move back. - I will burn this. What is happening there? Students, what's going on there? Go ahead and eat, Mr. Qureshi is a friend. You haven't started accepting capitation fee yet. No. Please take something. - OK no, problem. Everything can be managed. Papa. You're back. - Yes. How was your paper? - The invigilator tore my answer shee What? - But I was saved... But what exactly happened? Rocky arrived in the nick of time and handled everything. Rocky? Who? Rakesh. He said he was your friend. You know what? The invigilator today was collecting money from everyone and letting them cheat. I didn't have any money on me! So he cancelled my paper. Then brother Rakesh arrived and took charge of everything. He actually made that invigilator write my exam for me. I think I'm going to top the exam this time. Will you take poison in the name of help? Did you have to humiliate your father like this? One doesn't have to fail in life to pass an exam. Get it? Are you sick or something? - No. Then why are you wasting your time eating fruit? This buffet costs 1500 per head, get the main course. You know today's Tuesday and I fast. Keep some food in the bag then. We'll have it for breakfast tomorrow. We're in Mumbai and she still can't let go of her Tuesday's. Buffet in a 5-star hotel, brother. I guess you have a fantastic scheme on your mind. All this is for you. If I don't work hard, then who will feed your children? Why am I blamed for every scheme? Tell me. You definitely have something on your mind. How much do we earn in Engineering per seat, not counting expenses? How much? Around a million or maybe two. - Yes.. A million or two. Now. This is the big MBA game. Understand. Profits will be double. Come on. Double? Wait a minute. And, what about Kota? Cricket and exams don't have a season Yes, they don't. I get it. Just tell me that we can retire after this. And settle down together in one of those beautiful places.. They show on National Geometry. That's Geography. Exactly. Listen. - Yes. Money couldn't stop me from spending a night in jail. The real game begins beyond money. Power. And do you know who has power? The signatory. Someone who doesn't need to show his wealth. Someone who doesn't break the law using his money. No. He just makes laws according to his convenience. The real fun will begin when Lucknow' Department, Delhi's Government, New York's Company, and the people on the highest post will owe m Students. And then just watch. We'll have all the files and permissions. We'll make the rules and we'll break them at our will. I got it. I'll have to work harder now. Only salaried people work hard. Rich people hatch scams. Big scam. Go on, eat your fruit. 5 million, and I'll guarantee the MBA seat. That's fine. But how can you guarantee? Am I asking you for money? I am not. This is my first time as well. Think about yourself. Even after mugging up RD Sharma, HC Verma, OP Bansal, and model papers What has been the success rate of your tutorial? 1 percent or less. And my commission? 10 percent. Parents and.. What the bloody hell! - You don't have any sense? I told you to get the letterhead printed. You can't do a thing right. I will have to talk to your boss. Yes, sir. How can I help you? You can't. Even if someone wants to help you, then how can he? Sorry. Speak to the lady politely. Or you might get arrested for noise pollution. Sorry, sir. Not sir. Ma'am. Sorry, ma'am. It's okay. Nupur. Thank you. I didn't have your number. Give me your phone. Thank you. Bye. "The heart's following in your wake." "And all I could do is watch." "There's something left in our hearts "yet to be conveyed". "A feeling which I could never express" "but, I want to say this to you." "You dwell in my heart" "and my eyes" "since the day I saw you." "You're the one that dwells in my heart" "and my eyes" "since the day I saw you." You have not changed even a bit. One needs a reason to change, which I don't have. But you look completely different. Can't say if I am looking different. But I definitely feel better. No more excuses, and a new reason every day. Sattu. Sattu's in Qatar. He's okay. I did come over to your house once but I think you guys had moved. Yes, dad got transferred. Order? - Ginger tea, or has that changed too Same. Two ginger teas. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. So... All well at home? In a way. Dad refused to speak with me for a ye But now even I am capable of earning money. So we do talk to each other on my birthday and on Diwali. I guess he feels that even though I didn't get married, at least there's no more burden on him now. Look, Nupur... - No. No need for an explanation. No, there is a need. You don't know how important it is. Sattu must have told you where all the money was coming from. But Nupur, there's a young timid Jhansi boy behind my dazzling present Who had neither a degree nor his father's wealth to flaunt. And, even if I had found a job the right way, then what do you think would've happened. A long wait. I would've lived only to pay bills. Bought a TV with my Diwali Bonus. And watched the rich live their life on it. I have no intentions to be a hero. No time to be a villain. I am just a player, playing a game. Pardon me, but your father only saw Sattu as an investment and he saw you like a deal. But the two of you were very special and I always knew that. Rakesh, I am embarrassed about one thing. You're married, and I didn't know. Nupur, I did get married, but not willingly. I have a wife who finds joy in taking care of my family, chores, and shoppi Nine years ago, while fixing my marriage dad said that a useless boy who couldn't even clear his entrance exam is hardly going to be able to find himself a girl! And I couldn't. I found you a bit late. "I am a crazy wanderer" "my feet don't stop anywhere." "But then in my waywardness" "I couldn't stop thinking about you." "I am a crazy wanderer" "my feet don't stop anywhere." "But then in my waywardness..." "I couldn't stop thinking about you." - Congratulations for the new office. "Love is a strange prison." "No one wants to be free." "You dwell in my heart" "and my eyes" "since the day I saw you." "Love's conspiring in a way" "that we meet again." "You dwell in my heart" "and my eyes" "since the day I saw you." "Since the day I saw you." Wait a minute. Hello. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Rakesh. Happy birthday to you. - Thank you. We are missing you a lot. See, we even ordered cake for you, Made out of fresh fruit. Now take a bite. It's nice, smells delicious. Are you busy in a meeting. Or are you in a lift? I can hear a song playing at the back No, I came out for dinner. All okay. - Yeah. Are you busy? Here, talk to mom. Hello son. - Hello, mother. Is your TV working fine? - Yes, granny was saying... Yes, I'll send one for her too. - Yes, son. But I was saying.. Okay. Rakesh, I've to go. - Listen. Go to Siddhivinayak tomorrow. Okay, talk to your wife now. So what did you have for dinner? Chinese? I will call back later. I must go now. Okay, okay, take care. Convey my regards to the person. Yes. Bye. Nupur, you're so late. The boss has been waiting for you. Where were you? Fine. Rakesh, 5 minutes please. Okay. - What is it? Where have you been? Sir, I... - This is no time to come in. Sorry. Come in. I've been trying your number. I want this entire presentation on my desk in one hour. But sir, Ajay said... Ajay is your senior. I am sure he has other important business to attend to. What were you doing today? Didn't I tell you to come early? And you were on a call.. You are supposed to work 24/7. Rakesh, I guess it's going to take me longer than expected. Can we meet later? Is everything okay? - Yes. Sure? Okay. You can donate your cash in religious organizations, sir. It will go as anonymous donations, and then come back to you. Mr. Vaidya's political party is pretty new in this field. He'll lend you his complete support. 20%, that's all. 20% is too much, and you know that. Rocky sir, that Jatin is taking too much credit. Don't judge me by my looks. I can route your money through Panama You can start some companies with me out there, under pseudo names of cour Or maybe in the name of one of your family members. Let's keep the family out of this. There's no need for that, sir. We can open a company even with a PO Box number. We'll transfer the cash there, show some profit.. Pay some taxes on that profit and your money will become legal. And you can transfer that money to my party fund. And a year later.. You'll have everything like permissio tenders, education loans, etc. I get it. But if brother Jatin finds out that you came to see me, he'll make you run naked. You! Look. We'll handle him. Everyone wants to do business. Make me a shareholder. Or else? Or else what? Or else... I am not threatening you. Well, I'll be taking your leave then. Bablu. Come here. - Yes. Talk to him. He's really scared of threats. Talk to him. Rocky sir... Do you want to threaten me? And then I left immediately. Are you alright? Yes. Did your boss misbehave with you? I can't go for the Zurich offsite. I am more of a slave than a junior employee. I make all the presentations.. But I am not allowed inside the presentation room. And they call me PPT Usha behind my back. Go ahead, laugh. Forget it. And find yourself a new job. Men! As soon as someone refuses to be their eye-candy... And starts using her skills, they start feeling insecure! Give me your CV. It won't matter, Rakesh. I've talked to everyone I know, but it's the same old story everywher Then why don't you apply for MBA? Because promotion and job security will only come after that. Otherwise, you'll be slogging for the rest of your life. But one needs to prepare for it. And I have an Arts background so it'll be much more difficult for m Why don't you try at least? I agree. Fill the application form first. Then we'll see. Okay. One more drink. Sure, sir. Yes tell me. Yes, brother. I know you said MBA game, double prof What do we have to do? Wait just a minute. What? Not to you, brother. I am talking to Jahnvi. For Engineering, it was one candidate at a time. But in MBA, we'll make millions in a conference hall. Book a hotel. Sir, they are booking a room. Keep me informed. And, who are our top students? Yash Sharma, Pune. Atul Mohan, Lucknow. Shubham Roy, Chennai. Call them to Mumbai on 9th December to crack the MBA paper. Okay, brother. And then? When are we going to put your father-in-law's bank job to use, you idiot? Okay, brother. I get it. Is it something special? The envelope will reach directly to one of your bank lockers. On 9th December. I know it does every year. I'll inform you as soon as I find out which branch. Do you have a tiff with any of the bank managers? No, there's no such thing. But... What is this all about? Nice shot. All the envelopes that you receive between 9 a.m. and 12 noon... I want to check all of them. In all the branches? Listen carefully, dad. We'll find out which branch first. Then, after that. You're not listening at all. What if I check it myself? No! You won't understand the document I'll just take a peek and keep it bac It will take all of 15 minutes. 'In order to fool the system...' 'One must cultivate the fools in the system.' 'Today these fools will shine like stars.' Did anyone come? No. We're from the Education Board. - Please sit. Please inform your Manager. He's expecting us. Thank you. Yes, sir. They are here.
