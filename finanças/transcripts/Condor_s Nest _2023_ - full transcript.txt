(SPEAKING GERMAN) CAPTAIN KEENE: (IN ENGLISH) Cowboy Leader, this is Cowboy Three. We've lost two engines. Sir, engine three's done for. Will, do you copy? Come in, Will, do you copy? Will! (METAL CLANGS) Will, do you read me? Engines are burning! Will, get everyone in the radio room. WILL: Engines are burning! We gotta bail! I'm staying with the plane. I'm riding this thing in. Brace for impact. SOLDIER: Come on, on your feet! Hold her steady. A thousand feet! (PANTS) Nine hundred feet! Impact positions! Brace for impact! (SCREAMING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Shit! Shit, shit, shit! God damn it to fucking shit! Where the hell are we? Nowhere good. Briefing said the Krauts don't have men this far into France. We might be good. (LIGHTER CLANGS) Well, they sure as shit had flak. Where's Will? Will! Will. Come on, pal. Let's go. Captain needs you. We didn't hit our target. We caught flak... I know, I was a little distracted, but what I'm saying is... Where's Pete? He's dead. (EXHALES) So is Bosch and Littleton. Oh, God. Uh, sir, where the fuck are we? Well, we took flak near the Rhine. Started our descent... south by southwest. So, this is probably... Bow-vee-ay. Bouvier. Forty miles from fucking Germany. Uh, sir, the front line's pretty close, isn't it? So, if we cut west, we'll probably hit friendlies. Wouldn't that be some shit? Will... You speak French? Yes. Can you shoot? Yeah. Kelly, go grab a rifle and a flare pistol. Hey, I want you to get in that house. If anybody's in there, they speak French, they're on our side. I want you to get in the attic. If you see any Germans coming, you shoot a flare real low so they don't see it, okay? You understand? So, what do we do? All right. I want you to start tearing this plane apart. Anything you can carry, all right? We're jogging outta here. Get in the fucking attic. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SIGHS) Let's go! Everything you can get off the son of a bitch. Let's go. You find us a route? I mean, hell, didn't Patton just take Saint-Dizier a few days ago? That's only 120 miles back that way. Our line's gotta be close. We'll make it work. Yeah. Let's go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (FLARE BOOMS) Hey, we got a flare. (PANTS) Krauts! Guys, they got some kind of tank. Waist guns. Yeah, make it look like we're abandoned. That's our only shot, okay? Um, get on the guns. Stay low. Wait for my signal to shoot, okay? Go! Go! (TANK WHIRS) (NAZIS CHATTER) (BULLETS CLATTER) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WHIRS) BACH: Hello in there. My name is Colonel Martin Bach of the German Protection Squad. Better known to you probably as the SS. You will be offering your surrender to me. How many of you are in there? Your electrical systems have failed. None of your guns can operate, only your right-hand side machine gun can reach us at this angle. And now, it has no ammunition. So... On the count of three, you will tell me how many men are in there, or my tank will be forced to shoot your plane into a thousand pieces. How many of you are in there? One, two, three. SOLDIER: Five! What happened to the rest? They're dead. Tail gunner, ball turret, bombardier, they're all dead. Waist gunners died in the crash, too. How did the waist gunners die? SOLDIER: No seatbelts. (SCOFFS) Stupid. May I assume that you all know that there's no chance of escape? SOLDIER: Yeah, we know. Good. Come out slowly, one at a time, and stand in front of the wing. What was your target? You are now prisoners of the Third Reich. Do you know how much use Germany has for prisoners? None at all. To us, you are like insects to be squashed. So, I will ask you again. What was your target? This is a bomber aircraft, yes? Yeah. And you and the 200 other bombers that flew over a few minutes ago were on your way to bomb a target in Germany, yes? That's right. Then what target were you bombing? Hey, Jerry, here's your target, you piece of shit. (GASPS) What was your target? I'm the pilot. It was a marshalling yard in Munich. Thank you. Is General Patton's army proceeding to Grand Marseille or going to Nantes? I don't know. (BREATHING SHAKILY) Is General Patton's army going to Grand Marseille or proceeding to Nantes? Eat shit. (NAZIS LAUGH AND MUTTER) (WILL BREATHING SHAKILY) (SPEAKING GERMAN) You and you, into the field. Go. Go! SOLDIER: It's okay. Stop! Is General Patton going to Grand Marseille or Nantes? We don't know. We're just flight crew. We don't know troop positions. (TANK WHIRS AND CLICKS) Tell me, you must know. Save your men and tell me. I don't... I don't know. I don't know. I, uh... Maybe Munich. He said... Maybe Munich. He said Munich. Munich? What is your next target? I swear. I swear, I don't... I... Okay. Stuttgart. You're lying! Tell me! I'm not. I'm not. Stuttgart. Okay, just listen to me. It has to be Stuttgart. Okay? If Patton is sending his men this way, then it has to be Stuttgart. The yard supply the German Army. The whole bomb group will keep targeting the yards until, until Patton makes his move. You... Just, please, listen to me. Hey. Stop. This is only conjecture. No! (WHIMPERS) Is Patton's army going to Grand Marseille or Nantes? You go to hell. (GUNSHOT BANGS) (FOREIGN MUSIC) (WATER SLOSHES) (MUSIC STOPS) (POTS CLANG) (SPANISH MUSIC) (MEN WHISPER IN GERMAN) (DOOR BANGS) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (BOTTLE THUDS) Who's hungry? You have to be hungry by now, right? It's been 15 hours. You're hungry? (PLATE CLANGS) (HUFFS) Is it poisoned? (HUFFS) I don't know who you think we are, but I have nothing to give you. I am the manager of a small loan office near the plaza. If you want a loan, I can approve a loan for you, but I have nothing more to offer. I manufacture automobiles. On the line. I put the alternator in the engine compartment. I can put a new alternator in your car for... For free. Gerhard Kohler? Yes. You're Austrian? Yes, I am from Austria. Emilio? I am a proud Argentine. That's an Argentinian accent? Si. (SCREAMS) (CURSES IN GERMAN) (WHIMPERS) Emilio. Emilio! Swear in Spanish. You're not a proud Argentine, are you? (SCREAMS) Navy? You look like a navy man. (KNIFE CLANGS) Interior Ministry for the Third Reich. I was an administrator for education policy. I have been living here peacefully since the last nine years. Uh, tell me what you want. Anything you want. How many Nazis came out here? To Argentina? WILL: Anywhere in South America. A thousand? A thousand in Uruguay, a thousand in Bolivia, three thousand in Argentina, four thousand in Brazil. Yeah, that's what the last fella told me. That 10,000 Nazis just up and walked outta Germany. I'm looking for a man, a colonel in the SS, Martin Bach. (LAUGHING) You travel all the way to Argentina to kidnap two policy administrators and ask if they know a colonel? Yeah, that's pretty much the gist of it. You know him? EMILIO: There must be a thousand men called Colonel Bach in the Reich. You can't possibly expect us to know which one you're talking about! (SCREAMS) Colonel Martin Bach in the SS, stationed in Eastern France in August 1944. Maybe near Strasbourg. I don't know of any such man. I'm very sorry. How about you? (BABBLES) Do you know Colonel Bach? (EMILIO MUTTERS) What? I can't hear you. (SPEAKING GERMAN) I can't hear you, Emilio. (IN ENGLISH) No, I don't. I can't hear you. I don't. I don't. I don't. Where is Colonel Bach? I don't know! (GRUNTS) You're mad. You're mad. There is no way of knowing where there is a Colonel Bach. I'm telling you, there's no way to know. He may already be dead. He's not dead. Obersturmbannfuhrer Martin Bach got on a cargo ship in Italy nine years ago, headed for Buenos Aires. I know because the Nazi-sympathizing priest who smuggled him on board told me right before I strangled him. (LAUGHS) And you're going to kill every German in South America until you find this Colonel Bach? That's the plan. (CLICKS) (GUNSHOT BANGS) (SAND CRUNCHES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SHOVEL CLANGS) (SPANISH MUSIC) (PATRONS CHATTER) Would you like another whiskey? Yes. I remember you from earlier this week. Are you waiting for a friend? No. Just, uh, having a drink. Your accent. It sounds like you're from France? Switzerland. Ah, Swiss. Where in Switzerland are you from? Uh, St. Lucian. I've never heard of it. It's very small. Ah. What's it near? It's near Zurich. I've never been. Ah, the gentleman at the end of the bar, he has been to Zurich. Javier! No, sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but I wish to be left alone. Thought you might make a friend. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (IN ENGLISH) This gentleman is from Zurich and I told him you have been. Zurich. You are from Zurich? I lived there for three years studying at university. Oh, it is my favorite city in the whole wide world. Oh, my God. I could live there. The girls? (GRUNTS AND LAUGHS) They're quite nice. Yes, quite nice. Quite nice. So, what are you doing in Argentina? Business. Ah. What kind of business? Bananas. My father owns a plantation in Brazil. In Switzerland? In Brazil. We live there. I thought you meant Switzerland. Hello, everyone. Come buy my bananas from the snow in Switzerland, right? Special snow bananas, grown in Zurich. A toast to Switzerland and to bananas grown in Brazil. It was nice to meet you. So, tell me about Brazil. Is a true what they say about the bananas in Brazil? About the girls? Girls? What they do with all those bananas. I knew it. They have to do something with all those bananas, right? Don't eat the bananas at this restaurant. The girl at the front just had all of them in her ass. (PATRONS CHATTER) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LIGHTER CLICKS) (GUN CLICKS) (STUTTERING) What do you want from me? I have nothing. I have nothing, please. Who are you? A missionary. A missionary? Yes, yes. I swear to you. I am here to begin a Lutheran mission. You're a German. Yes, yes. A... A Lutheran. And what are you doing with a gun? Uh, defending myself. I... I have been robbed here three times. What was in the envelope you magically made disappear? (STUTTERS) I can't tell you. (GUNSHOTS BANG) (VOGEL SCREAMS) The next one is going in your skull. No, no, no. No, no, no. It was a name. It's the name of a... Of a prostitute. Rosita Rossi. I wasn't going to go with her. You see, it was a very... It was a mistake. I... I am a very good Lutheran. I was going to pray for her soul. You're fucking lying! I am not lying. I am not lying. I swear to you, I am not lying. You're a fucking Nazi. No, no, no. God, no. No. You're a fucking Nazi piece of shit. I am not. Say it! God forgive me. (SCREAMS) God forgive me. God forgive me. Shut the fuck up and admit it, you fucking pig! No, no, no... Three! I swear to you please, no. Two! Please don't kill me. You have to believe me, please. One! No, please, no. (WHIMPERS) Zero. Who are you looking for? Who are you looking for? An SS officer, Colonel Bach. Colonel Bach. Obersturmbannfuhrer Bach, let me see. Maybe middle age, taller than average. He's thin. You described nothing. Goodbye. Martin. Huh? (LAUGHS AND CLICKS TONGUE) Yes, yes. Martin Bach. Where is he? (SIGHS) I don't know. Where is he? (FLOORBOARDS CREAK) There's no way out. WOMAN: Don't move. Who are you? Shut up. Put your pistol on the floor. Slowly, or I will shoot. (GUN CLANGS) Kick it over here. Do you live here? Who the hell are you? I have the gun. I will ask the fucking questions. Do you live here? Yes or no? Yes. The man you punched at the bar said you're from Switzerland. You're clearly American. Yeah. I'm an American. Who is the man you followed from the bar? He's my father. You chased your father out of a bar? How'd you find me here? I followed your car. I saw you get out with that man. I know he's here, and I don't believe he's your father. Who do you think he is? I know he is Albert Vogel. Who is Albert Vogel? (SIGHS) If you are protecting Albert Vogel, I will have you extradited along with him. It will not go well for you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Extradited? Who the hell are you? Extradited to where? To Jerusalem, to pay for his crimes. You're from Israel. Who I am does not matter. If you have Albert Vogel, give him up now. Listen to me. The man you saw me with is my father. We sell bananas. You know why I'm pretending I'm Swiss? I know there are a lot of Germans around here. So, I picked a country they don't care about. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Don't shoot. He's deaf. What? My father, he's... He's deaf. Bullshit. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) He can't hear a damn thing you're saying. Listen to me. Now, you broke into a home and you are pointing a gun at American citizens. We make one call to the US Embassy, the Nazi-collaborating police are going to arrest you, and they're gonna find out they have an Israeli spy trying to extradite their pals. How do you think that's gonna go for you? Why do you carry a gun? We get robbed a lot. If I find out he is Albert Vogel, you will both hang. (VOGEL SIGHS) Why the hell did you come up here? If she had heard your accent... I had to get her to leave. It was the only way. (SIGHS) I was hoping you would improvise, and you did. How do you know Colonel Bach? I met him here, Buenos Aires, maybe a year ago. (CHUCKLES) At a Christmas party. Wait, he's here? No, no, no. He lives in Bolivia. Tell me where or I start shooting. And then, you will just waltz across miles of mountains and deserts and knock on his door and shoot him without any confrontation? The Germans have thousands of guards protecting their interests here. If you are bumbling around the desert, they will find you long before you'll find him. If you want Colonel Bach, you're going to need me to help you find him. In exchange for what? As it happens, we have mutual interests. I also have to get to Bolivia. We travel there together. When there are threats to me, we play your little game. I will pose as your deaf Swiss father and business partner, selling bananas. What threats? Machine gun-toting women from Jerusalem or the equivalent. Why me? Why not these other Germans if there's so many of them? Well, the Germans want me dead, too. It's, uh... It's complicated. But the Soviets don't. That envelope, that contained the location of a contact that was going to get me to safety in Moscow. He is at a remote airfield in Bolivia. And as it happens, that airfield is not very far from your Colonel Martin Bach. If you want your German, get me to my Russian. How are we getting there? The next boat leaves in five hours. We made it to the mouth of the river here headed north. Germans are watching the airfields and major ports, but we can putter up to Paraguay undetected. The capital of Asuncion is a risk, but if we make it, we can take the back roads all the way to Bolivia. I'd rather fly, but it's probably safer to hire a native to guide us to the rendezvous. I doubt our friend from Israel will find us there. (CHUCKLES) So, you are Albert Vogel. In the flesh. (LAUGHS) What's that woman want with you? What did you do? Nothing. I am an atomic physicist. One of the better ones in the world. I was part of a team developing the atom bomb for Germany. The Soviets are recruiting me to work for them. And she's trying to stop you? She works for a spy agency called Mossad. Jerusalem is trying to extradite me to hang for war crimes, but bigger problem is that the Germans here, they have no use for me. They would rather kill me to keep me from helping the Russians or the Americans. That's tragic. The Nazis are trying to kill me. That ought to make me your friend. You made bombs for Hitler. You sit at a table with Nazis, that makes you a Nazi. The man who makes the object is not responsible for the man who uses it. If I make a, um, butter knife and you stick it in someone's throat, does that make me a murderer? Butter knife? Hitler would've used your atom bomb on civilians. Which your country did twice, I believe, yes? That's different. We're not Hitler. We're the good guys. 200,000 dead Japanese civilians might think differently. I swear to Christ. I will put a bullet right through your stupid fucking Nazi face. Give me one more goddamn platitude, I'll end it right here and we solve this whole thing right now. Control yourself. They have eyes everywhere. I guess I need you alive for now. You take me to my Russian safely, and I tell you exactly where your Colonel Bach is hiding. Yeah. You go on your merry way to Russia to build the bombs they wanna drop in my backyard? Mmm. They say the man who seeks revenge should dig two graves. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CHURCH BELLS TOLLING) BARTENDER: Welcome to the Hotel Asuncion. (LIGHTER CLICKS) Here for business or pleasure? Business. Bananas. Ah, from Brazil? Yes, Brazil. Your accent sounds Swiss. Many Swiss come to Asuncion from Brazil. Yes, they do. Something for you, madam? Here on business? Yeah, here on business. We're having a conversation. Where is Vogel? My father is upstairs in his room. That man is not your father. You look nothing alike. You're following me because we don't look alike? I know that he's Albert Vogel. You've never seen a photograph of him before, have you? You have a description. Nothing else. That's what I thought. So, what do you do? You just run around torturing every German you find until they admit they're Vogel? Pencil. Get him a pencil! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Buenos tardes. (SNAPS FINGERS) Maxim! BARTENDER: Hola, Senor Ziegler. Maximiliano! Maximiliano! ZIEGLER: Whatever these guys are having, and I'll have a Pisco sour. Tres sour, Max. Three Pisco sours. Hello. (SHAKER RATTLES) The Pisco sour, have you ever tasted it? No, never. Nein. De Maximiliano, he makes the best Pisco sour known in South America. Huh, brandy with sugar, lemon, bitters, and an egg. An egg. An egg. (MEN GROAN) Maximiliano, tres mas on my bill. You don't have to do that. No, I don't have to do that, but I insist. Yes. Insist. Thank you. You're very kind. So, are you from here, in Paraguay? No, Germany. Deutschland! Germany? We are from Germany. I am from Freiberg. Freiberg, no! (MAN LAUGHS) (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) Ah! (IN ENGLISH) It's nice. (LAUGHS AND GRUNTS) Are you all from Germany? No, they are from Switzerland. The French part. They don't speak a word of German. And the father is, uh, gehorlos, he can't hear. Ah, well. Prost! Prost! MAN: To our new friends. ZIEGLER: Yes. There we go. Mmm-hmm. (SPEAKING GERMAN) So, you are here for business, ja? Yes. We have a banana plantation in Brazil, but it's hard to ship bananas from the jungles in Porto Velho, so we're here to find a shipping company. Wow, Porto Velho. My... My father went there before the war. It's a wild place. Right? There's a lot of bandits. ZIEGLER: Bandits? Like the Wild West. You have savages trying to steal your bananas. (LAUGHS) The savages, it's like... (MEN MUTTER AND GIGGLE) No, no, no. It's too dangerous. Dangerous? We put guards on top of the banana trains all the way to the depot in Porto Velho. They've shot enough bandits to scare most of them from trying. So... And so, you shoot them as they're trying to get on the train? It's the Wild West. Ah! (LAUGHS) It's the Wild West! That's all right, I don't... LEYNA: Well, it's getting late. Should we get going? Nein, nein, nein. You're leaving us too soon. Mmm-hmm. Banana farmers start early. Nein. I insist you stay for one more drink. Just one drink. Unless... you have a penis, then you must go. You must go. (MEN LAUGH) Nein. I... I... I apologize. If you really must go. LEYNA: We must. Mmm-hmm. Thank you for the drinks, gentlemen. (MAN CLEARS THROAT) Goodbye. (MAN LAUGHS) Tschuss! ZIEGLER: I'll be here if you change your mind. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROANS) (MEN SPEAKING GERMAN) (MAN 2 SPEAKING) (MAN 1 SPEAKING) LEYNA: How did he know they were coming? What? The Germans at the bar. How did he know they were coming? He saw 'em from his window, I guess. And just knew that they were German? I think the German machine guns were a clue. We dodge Nazi gangs down here all the time. They're not that hard to spot. I'm not afraid of any Germans. I've gotten pretty good at spotting them. (GUNSHOT BANGS) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Put the gun down! (SPEAKING GERMAN) Calm down, and put the gun down. Put the fucking gun down! (BULLETS CLATTER) LEYNA: (IN ENGLISH) How did they find us? I don't know. Did you tip them off? Did he? No, they're after him, too. We're not outrunning 'em. We don't need to. (BULLETS CLATTER) Catching up. Heads down! Drive straighter, you idiot. Slow down! What? Slow down, I have a plan. If I slow down, we're gonna die. Slow down! WILL: They're catching up. Hold your speed. They got a rocket launcher. Huh? (GUNSHOTS BANG) (SPEAKING GERMAN) LEYNA: You're with a Nazi? Why are you with a Nazi? Why are you helping a Nazi escape? It's complicated. Complicated? He's a fucking Nazi. What is complicated about that? I am not a Nazi! You can tell that to the court in Jerusalem. Oh, he's not going to Jerusalem. According to who? According to me. We have a deal, all right? Vogel's just a pawn who worked for the Nazis. I have some business to finish with an actual Nazi, an SS Colonel responsible for a lot of people's deaths. Vogel's helping me find him. An actual Nazi? Hitler's atomic scientist isn't enough of a Nazi for you? We have a deal. You have no deal. You will hang. (CAR THUDS) It's, uh... (CHUCKLES) This is... It's no good. We cannot fix this tonight. More of those Germans are coming. They won't stop. We passed a warehouse back up the road. Let's find a car and get clear. You need to decide right now if you're gonna be a problem. Or you'll kill me for the Nazi? So I can kill more Nazis, better Nazis. Nazis of consequence, not some lab assistant the Germans don't even want. Lab assistant? Is that what he told you? I won't touch Vogel yet, but I want to know who your other Nazis are. All right. First, let's find a car. (OPERA MUSIC) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Herr. We've been out here all night. The Germans will be out looking for us. VOGEL: It is almost fixed. We have no time for "almost fixed." Is it ready? (SIGHS) All it needs is the key. Start it up then. (HOOD CLANGS) What is that? Whiskey. It's been a long night. What the hell are you... I'm taking Albert Vogel. If you try to stop me, I will shoot you. (SPEAKING GERMAN) There are more important Nazis than Vogel. (IN ENGLISH) Name one Nazi of more consequence in South America than Albert Vogel or get out of my way. Heinrich Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. The architect of the destruction of millions of Jews across Europe. Heinrich Himmler is dead. You're wrong. You're full of shit. He killed himself. He's been dead for 10 years. You don't rise to the right hand of Hitler and engineer the extermination of millions of Jews without making some connections. A man claiming to be Himmler surrendered to the British, bit into a capsule of potassium cyanide, and died. But that man wasn't Himmler. He was a fanatical party loyalist who gave his life for the cause. The real Himmler went into hiding, a month in Austria, six months in Florence. From there, he disguised himself as a priest and smuggled himself onto a cargo ship bound for Argentina. He's been in South America for 10 years now, building a hidden empire in total secrecy, employing former Nazi party members, recruiting German veterans into an elite army, operating a web of spies and guards across the continent and eliminating every threat that comes across his doorstep. Those men at the bar were looking for threats to Himmler. They were looking for you. Why are you telling me this? I can't build Himmler a bomb by myself. He wants me dead so the Russians can't use me. Tell me where he is. (CHUCKLES) If I tell you that, you have no reason to keep me around, but as it happens, the two men you are looking for are together in Bolivia, in a compound called the Condor's Nest. Why? Bach is Himmler's Chief of Security. Our deal is still on. You get me to my Russian safely, and I'll give you Colonel Bach, and then, you, you will have Heinrich Himmler. No. VOGEL: It's Heinrich Himmler! I am no one! LEYNA: If Heinrich Himmler is here, I can't capture him by myself, but I can capture you right now, and I will. (SPEAKING GERMAN) This. This is a transmitter. It's a simple switch, wired to a battery, and if I push this switch, this car will explode. What? You and Himmler's big secret will die in this room. You can't just turn a car into a bomb. Get that rope and tie her up, or I'll kill us all! Give me the transmitter. Then, I tie her up. (WHISPERING) Carefully. Fucking pigs! You're gonna fucking pay for this! VOGEL: Let's go! (LEYNA SPITS) You think you're the only one in the world who's lost something to the Nazis? You're a fucking coward. What? So we're walking? Walking? Lucky for you, I know how to fly. (BREATHING LABORIOUSLY) (ENGINE REVS) (AIRPLANE ENGINE BUZZES) (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) I don't think our banana charade is going to work here. Follow my lead. If they recognize my face, shoot them. Wait, tell me where Colonel Bach is. If anything happens, you owe me that. He'll be at the Condor's Nest, guarding Heinrich Himmler. It's in the forest 20 kilometers west of a small town called Tarija. Kilometer marker 167. (VOGEL AND OFFICERS SPEAKING GERMAN) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TYPEWRITER CLICKS) (MUTTERS) (VOGEL CLEARS THROAT) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN ENGLISH) I would like to buy a box of whiskey. I have, uh... I have scotch. I have rye. Ridiculous code words. I did not make it up. Albert Vogel? Yes. You are not to be here till next week. I hope it is not a terrible inconvenience. No. Here. Put in mouth. What is this? It's cyanide. (CHUCKLES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I don't understand. I have my reasons. But aren't you with the Soviets? It is also complicated. Put in mouth and bite down. If you are with the Germans, why haven't you just shot me? Because it make big mess. I don't... You are going to kill yourself. You must bite down. If you are with the Germans, I want to make a deal. I can build a bomb, an atom bomb for Heinrich Himmler. There's only one man on this continent who is willing and able to build a bomb for Himmler, (CHUCKLES) and if you shoot that man, you're going to wish you had never left Moscow. What is deal? Get Himmler on the phone. And if he turns me down, I will take your cyanide. (SIGHS) Da. Give me Condor's Nest. (OFFICER SPEAKING GERMAN) Yeah. Yeah. (MAN ON PHONE SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (IN ENGLISH) The American in the airplane wants to kill Heinrich Himmler. (OFFICER SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN ENGLISH) It's not much fun being the one in the chair. (CHUCKLES) You know, you were right. That day on the boat, when you said, uh, I sit at the table with Nazis. I do. Proudly. Heil Himmler. Hello, Jew boy. VOGEL: He's not Jewish. Not Jewish? No. He's American. Ah. Now, that's funny. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Are you sure you are not a Jew? Mmm? (SCOFFS AND COUGHS) You smell like a Jew. Now, I am not a detective, but I would guess you were going to use this gun to shoot Germans? Maybe me? (CLICKING TONGUE) Now, I am not a detective, but let's see how many questions I can get you to answer. Huh? Every time I don't like your answer, I pull the trigger. Mmm? Huh? (WILL BREATHES LABORIOUSLY) What's your name? William Spalding. Who are you trying to kill? Germans. Germans? Yeah. Yeah. See, I am a German. So, I do not like that answer. Which Germans? Hmm? Himmler? No. Klaus Barbie? No. Col... Colonel Martin Bach. Bach? Why? He deserves to die. Mmm. (GUN CLICKS) God damn it. (LAUGHS) (PANTS) I didn't like that answer. Are you with the CIA? No. No one but me is coming after Martin Bach. I don't care about Himmler or you or anyone else. Just Martin Bach. (GRUNTS) Why Martin Bach? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Fuck you! (GUNFIRE PATTERS) There is a Jewish Mossad agent and an American trying to get to the Condor's Nest. Stop them! (BELL RINGS) Is that a Jew? You better hope not. I think your luck has run out. Don't move. I will shoot him. You'd be doing me a favor. Where is Albert Vogel? (CAR ENGINE REVS) I don't recognize that engine, so I can assume that you arrived here in a car and Vogel just escaped with it. Huh? Look at you. Huh? You thought you could kill Heinrich Himmler, but now you're going to die like every other ordinary Jew! Just like the ones we threw into the gutters in Freiburg. You're from Freiburg, yes? We must have taken thousands of Jews from that town, lined them up and shot them in the head, one by one. And then rolled them into the ditch with the rest of the rats. He's at the Condor's Nest. Albert Vogel is at the Condor's Nest. Shut up or I will shoot you. It's in the mountains, 20 miles west of a town called Tarija. I will shoot you! Mile marker 167. Not another word! Himmler's there, too! You know what to do. (MUTTERS IN GERMAN) (CLICKS) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (GUNSHOTS BANG) RADIO OPERATOR: I lose my brother, and my uncles, Soviet prisoners at Birkenau. Himmler and his people, they killed them. They put them in trucks and gassed them. You get chance to kill Himmler, you kill Himmler. Go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) How did you know where I was? I didn't. I followed Ziegler. All the way here? How? I drove the car. I guess I owe you a thanks. A thanks? Who the fuck are you? This whole time, you've been protecting Vogel better than all the Germans in this desert possibly could have. Why do you want this Bach so badly? For the same reason you want Vogel. Kilometer 167? Kilometer 167. Why would you tell me that? In the tent, he was going to shoot you. You bet your life on me. I've spent 10 years destroying anything that got between me and Colonel Bach. I guess it was time to stop. Does your Colonel Bach deserve to die? Yes, he does. Lucky for you, I know how to fly a plane. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Let's go! (PLANE ENGINE REVS) (MEN SPEAKING GERMAN) Ah. (SCOFFS) (SIGHS) (PIANO KEYS RESONATE) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (HIMMLER SPEAKING) (WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN) (SIRENS WAILING) (ENGINE REVS) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN ENGLISH) Are you the Jew or the American? WILL: The Jew is with Himmler. Drop the gun. Who are you? William Spalding. Why are you here? To find Colonel Martin Bach of the German Protection Squad, known better as the SS. What do you want with me? Do you remember where you were on August 30th, 1944? No, not exactly. Was it Eastern France? That sounds right. Was it Bouvier? Was it a farm with a crashed B-17 bomber and a tank? It was a long war. But you remember, don't you? It was a long time ago. You killed six men in cold blood. You remember that. You were there? Were you one of the airmen? Halt, halt, halt! Put your gun down or I shoot! (SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN ENGLISH) William Spalding, walk away. There are three guards in this room and a hundred more running around outside the fortress here. If you fire that pistol, they will hear you, and you will be dead instantly. Walk away now, and you will live. (ENGINE PURRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOLDIERS SPEAKING GERMAN) (LEYNA SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN) I'm not walking away. Then why haven't you shot me? I want a confession. A confession? All right. I will confess. During the war, an airplane on its way to bomb my country crashed in front of me. With the enemy advancing towards me, and no way to carry prisoners, I was left with two choices. One, I could let the men go so that they could get into another airplane and continue to bomb my country. Or, two, I could kill them to stop them from doing that. I chose to kill them to save the lives of my men and my beloved Germany. Truthfully, you are no different than me. You, up in your airplane, dropping bombs on men and women while they're sleeping in their beds. Don't... But you did it, because if you had not, those same men and women would've woken up, put on their boots, and built more airplanes to drop bombs on you while you were sleeping in your bed. I saw everything you did. I shouldn't have let you live. Let me live? Mmm. Maybe, all along, it was you that had to come here to confess to me. You are gonna die for what you did. You have nothing to confess to. You followed every instinct that I and everyone else in that war would have. And now, you've crossed the continent for a confession, and look where you are. You are going to be responsible for capturing Heinrich Himmler. You are not a coward. You are a hero. (SPEAKING GERMAN) All you have to do is walk out that door and disappear. The whole world will know of your bravery. American newspapers will proclaim your name. "William Spalding, American hero, "who captured Heinrich Himmler." You see, confessions are for dead men. You are reborn today, as a hero. If I was a hero, we would both be dead. We can both live. Go. Walk away. We don't deserve to live. (SIREN WAILING) (GLASS SHATTERS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BULLETS CLATTER) (GUN CLICKS) (YELPS) (GUN CLICKS) (CAR ENGINE SPUTTERS) Albert, step out of the car. Stand where I can see you. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN ENGLISH) It looks like you got your German. (VOGEL CHUCKLES) You know if you shoot me, you... You are not going to leave this place alive. Well, I guess you were right then. About what? A man who seeks revenge digs two graves. (GUN CLICKS) Put your hands up! Put your hands up now or we will shoot! VOGEL: Take your pistol out of your pocket. Put it on the ground. William, the girl is dead. You have no more moves. So, please, take your pistol out of your jacket, put it on the ground. Slowly!
