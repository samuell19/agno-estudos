Nori, just one more time, okay? Mom, where are you going? I'll just be gone for a bit. Thanks, Nick. I'll see you soon. Excuse me. I'm Detective Murphy. Who's my first responder? Over there. That's me. Homeless guy called it in. It's, uh... I've never seen anything like that before. When did you get here? A few minutes before midnight. Has anyone else been inside? Ju... just me and my partner here, uh, one of the EMTs, and, uh, Lieutenant... Welcome back, Detective. Picked a hell of a night to come back to work. Well, I hope you're not here to babysit me. I'm not. I was halfway home when I got the call. I was getting a lot of chatter about this one. Oh, yeah, why's that? You should probably pop your head in and take a look. Ah, good to see you. You, too. You ready for this? It's all you. Let me know if you need anything. What is this? She's completely charred, and there's no evidence of a fire. I know, exactly. The homeless guy, did he call in a body or a fire? Nothing about a fire, just the body. "Kyoko Oshiro," what happened to you? Mrs. Oshiro? Hi. I'm Detective Stella Murphy. Can I come in for a minute? Okay, so she left the apartment last night at around 9:45? And did she tell you where she was going? Who killed her? That's what I'm going to find out, Mrs. Oshiro. Do you know anyone who would want to hurt Kyoko, any friends, family, co-workers? Ma'am, I know that this is very difficult, but would you be willing to come down and identify Kyoko's body? I cannot. I understand. Before I go, would you mind if I took a look around? Thank you. Yeah, hold on one sec. Yeah? Can you send IT over? I need to change my password. For what? Because it's still Mara. Yeah, I'll send someone over. So we don't have any dental records to match to. Logic obviously points to this being Ms. Oshiro. Yeah, I figured as much. Family is not going to come identify. I don't blame them. This body, I ran carbon-14 dating on her a couple of times, even recalibrated the machine to make sure something wasn't wrong. Each reading put this body at more than 1,000 years old. She wasn't burnt. She's petrified. I want to see Mom. You cannot. Why not? We will hear from the police when they find something. Don't you want to see her? We will not speak about this anymore. Yeah? I need an APB sent out. On who? The homeless man who called in the body, Rudolfo Sanchez, he has a prior for arson a few years back. Call you back? Thanks. You got anything else? Is this the level of supervision I can expect from now on? I was wondering. Do you have any idea why a woman who was born 42 years ago has been dead for 1,000 years? Anyway, that's how the, uh, chain of command works. Right. Are you gonna have a problem with that? No. I left. You stayed, got a promotion. I'm proud of you. Stella, Stella. Sorry. I tried your first. She wouldn't stop asking for you. It's okay. Thank you. Nori, is everything okay? I was wondering if I could see my mom. Um. I'd really like to see her. Yeah, I understand. Um, honey, I don't know if that's a good idea right now. You... you don't want to see her like this. I need to. How old are you, again? I'm 18. Is your grandma here, Nori? No. Let's go. This is never easy. Okay. No. So this is her. No. Can I come in? Not right now. No, ma'am, was there something you didn't tell me? Your daughter's body was petrified, and the tests we ran came back saying she'd been dead nearly 1,000 years. I don't mean to overstep here. But your granddaughter, something happened to Nori when she saw her mother's body. Now considering the two strangest things I have ever seen in my life happened with your family, I'm thinking you could tell me something. You could not possibly understand. What happened? My Kaisho. And the detective saw. I didn't mean to. Nori, these people cannot know. There's no point in it. What? You must not be seen. You cannot... How you doing? It's a weird one, more questions than answers at this point. No, I mean, how are you? Oh, I'm fine. Just checking. I can still do that, right? Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I wasn't all right. Have a good night. Jake. Jake! Stella, what are you doing? I got to do my laundry. Excuse me. You been drinking? I don't like seeing you like this. Jake, can you just please stop it with all this, like, supervisor... Are you kidding me right now? My wife comes to our house that she hasn't been to in months, drunk. You think I don't have a right to be concerned? Fine. I'm not asking you to be fine. I'm asking you to be careful. Okay. What the fuck is that? Ow. Ow. I don't know when you got into this rogue I can, like, suffer through this on my own bullshit, but it doesn't have to be that way. You're not the only one in pain. Oh, that's funny, because it didn't really seem like it bothered you that much. I'll let myself out. Yeah, why don't you take a fucking cab? I don't want tea. Why didn't you or Mom ever explain what was going to happen to me? A Kaisho is something you must discover for yourself. It is our sacred gift to bring back what is beautiful in the world. But you must not be seen until you can learn to control it. Noriko, your mother did not want you to grow up living in fear. So instead, we chose to stay hidden from the world? I was so lost yesterday. You should not have gone. I needed to see her. I just want things to be normal. Do not complain about what is normal. You are not normal. Your Kaisho is more important than your happiness. It is your responsibility. Murphy. Murphy. I don't think you're ready to be back. Why, because of last night? I'm sorry. What time is it? Am I late for work, Jake? I don't understand. What's the problem? Oh, I don't know, drunk driving, maybe. I'm going to recommend you go back out on leave. Oh, okay, don't go on a power trip. You need more time. No, I don't need more time. What I need is to stay busy. Okay. I'm sorry. Last night was stupid, and it was reckless. It won't happen again. But if you're really worried about me, you'll let me do my job. I promise it's what's best for me right now. I can bring this case home. You just need to let me. If for a second I don't think you can handle it, I'm pulling you back off. All right. Evening, what can I get you? Hi. I'm looking for Davis. Is he here? I'll get him. Ordering anything? Yeah, a cup of coffee would be great. Thank you. It's clean, just the humidity makes everything a little sticky. I didn't want you to think things were dirty. What can I do for you, miss? I'm Detective Stella Murphy. I just have some questions about Kyoko Oshiro. Uh. Do you want to talk somewhere else? She asked me to do it. Excuse me? Look. I don't want to make this into some big deal. But, uh, I don't make a lot of money here. I'm barely managing to keep the lights on. With all that's going on out there, I don't know how you guys can come down on me for paying somebody a few dollars under the table. Okay. So what is it, a fine? Did she report this? She hasn't even been here for the last two shifts. Mr. Davis, I work homicide. Kyoko was found dead four days ago. Can I help you? Mom? No, Kyoko had a child and responsibility. She was taking care of her mother. There's no world in which she would do this to herself. Because it's not. Jake, she never even went to school. Nobody knows anything about her. I don't know, but it seems like Kyoko was just keeping her hidden inside. Or maybe she was... she was trying to keep something out. I don't know. Hello. Wait. What? What is this? I think this is who killed my mom. It happened in my mom's room. It was something in this book. I thought that maybe I could do it again to see who killed her. Have you ever done anything like that before or seen it? No. But I've grown up learning about my family, that we're connected to something very old. There used to be more like us, but people are afraid of what they don't understand. I used to feel so safe around her. Now it's as if I'm in this giant sea and... It just seems endless? Yes. I know that man. Mr. Davis has always been very nice to us. Anytime I was sick, he would bring over soup to our home. She said she really liked working here. Do you like your job? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's not easy, but, yeah, I like it. Might not be the best way to look at it, but sometimes when you see how bad it can be for people it forces you to evolve in more ways than one. That's good, right? Yeah. Whether or not you're growing closer or farther from the things in your life, it's just important that you're growing, right? Have a good night, okay? You, too. Bye. Shh, shh. Yeah, this is Detective Stella Murphy. I need all available units. She have someplace to go? Uh, yeah, we're working on that right now. Well, I think it's safe to say the killer knows the family. What? The entire apartment was trashed, but Nori's room was untouched. Hey, let's get you out of here, okay? I'll call you later. Can I stay with you tonight? Come on in. So I can get you some sheets for the couch. Okay, so here are some, uh, blankets. Is a t-shirt okay? Um, you can turn on the TV if you want. I don't have cable, but... Also I usually keep some music on while I sleep. Is that okay? Um. Do you want one? Does it hurt? Yeah, a little. I used to have this townhouse with my ex. Ex? Ex-husband, I used to be married. Oh. Yeah, we had this place. It wasn't anything fancy, but it was our dream home. Anyway, one night, I was lying in bed, and all of a sudden I heard this dripping sound. I was just lying there, listening to it, waiting for it to go away or waiting until I stopped caring about it or something. But neither happened, so I got up. And I... I went to go look for it, just searching around for this dripping sound. And all the faucets were turned off, and the windows were closed. I'm just looking for this little, like, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. So finally, I... I went out into the hallway. And I could hear that it was coming from inside the wall. There was really nothing I could do, short of putting a hammer through the wall. So I just went back to bed. And I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn't. And then it happened again the next night, and the next night, and the next night. So I got one of those little, uh, music players. And I, um, I would play my favorite jazz albums so I could sleep. The first night, I could still kind of hear the drip, but then it just kind of went away. You know, sometimes noise is so loud that you just have to make your own to cover it up. The radiators in our house used to make a loud banging. Yeah? We got them fixed. I brought you some coffee. I'm not supposed to. Okay. I'll just leave it here if you want it. So we have somewhere we need to be this morning. Why don't you hop in the shower? I left a towel and some clothes for you. Okay. Okay, just sign right there. I'll make sure your grandma is right next to her, okay? Thank you. Hey. Hey! Hey! It's a sports bike, no plates. Rider is in all black gear. I think male, but don't hold me to that. Okay, yeah, let me know. What did they say? Well, it's not much, but it's out to dispatch. It's not much to go on, but you never know. He's coming for me. Hey, I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Yeah. Being a detective just seems like asking a lot of people a lot of questions. You're not wrong about that, but you also need to know how to read people. It's not about their answers. It's about how they answer. Mr. Davis. Ladies, any news? Has a man in a motorcycle outfit ever come in here to talk to my mother? Yeah. Yeah, last week, she had an argument with some guy. He came in. He was decked out from head to toe. What? What were they arguing about? I don't speak Japanese. Well, what? I... I thought he was a customer, someone she knew. I don't know. I asked you. And I just remembered it. Do those work? Do you recognize him? No, just from today. Are you sure? Murph, my office, now. I'll be back. What the hell is she doing here? Jake, she's an active part of my investigation. Okay, a civilian, nonetheless a kid, cannot be in the pen, pretending to play junior detective. I'm getting an idea on some security footage. Her entire family is dead. We buried her mom this morning. And in the process, we found a possible suspect. An arsonist. This is not arson. We can agree something crazy is going on here, right? We have run out of words to describe the state of these bodies, let alone how the killings actually went down. And that little girl is at the center of it. I know what this sounds like, but she is special. What do you expect me to do with that? I expect you to believe me. All right, well, special isn't going to cut it. Especially since the second body showed up, we're getting a lot of pressure from upstairs. Oh, well, I'm sorry you're having a tough time. If you want to be helpful to me, call immigration. Check on the Oshiro family. Murphy. Hmm? Stay close. Hey, are you okay? I'm okay. All right. Do you mind if I lay down for a little while? You're in the guest bedroom upstairs. Make yourself at home. It's okay. Hey. You doing all right? Come on. You should have someone go back to the apartment. Um, maybe he left something behind. Maybe just do, like, a... Yeah, I already... I called already. Okay. It's good. How long has she been staying with you? Two nights, ever since her grandmother... Stella... I know. I know. I know. It's not a good look. Hey. It's okay. You're all right. It's just been so weird, having a kid around. It's okay. I'm sorry. It wasn't anybody's fault. She rolled onto her stomach in the middle of the night, which is something she had never done before. And when she was face down, her neck wasn't strong enough yet to turn to the side. So she... she suffocated in her sleep. Nobody tells you how afraid you become when you have a baby. I used to wake up at the slightest sound coming from the monitor, just so paranoid that every movement or cough or moan was something bad. She was so quiet that night. I'm sorry for going in there. It's okay. It's okay. So I'll just, um, I'll just set up in the living room. Do you need anything? Yeah, do you still have that speaker from the holiday party? Oh, I forgot to tell you, I fixed the drip. It's gone. It's in the junk drawer. Yeah. All right, go ahead. Right. Immigration just called. I got some information on the Oshiros. Yeah? Oshiro Kyoko and Umaris Yako immigrated in 1998. Six months later, they had Noriko. Get this. Supposedly, there's a son in the family, Jin Oshiro, wasn't on any of the immigration records. He was busted for assault in '08, nothing since. You think Nori knows about him? Nori? Nori? Oh, my God. Hi. I'm Jin. You're Nori, right? Did you kill them? No. It's more complicated than that. But, yeah, I did. Hey, did they ever mention me? You killed my mother! Nori! No. No, it's not like that, Nori. They were not good people, okay? They lied to you. My mother would never lie. I really wish that were true. Nori, listen. I'm your brother. What? I am your brother. Wait. For the rest of our family, the Kaisho was always beautiful, like yours. But to Mother, mine was wretched. She'd never do that. Trauma started the Kaisho. The trauma is what Mother gave to me. When I was a boy, Mother would take me into the city on a train, and I loved watching the sunset through the window. It was always beautiful. But one day, a man came into the train and sat down very close to Mother. He was a bad man. He was a bad guy. He kept staring at her. We got off the train. He followed us in the dark. And he showed up, and he grabbed Mother. I pulled his arm, and it turned to ash. But after that, Obaachan looked at me as cursed. She wouldn't speak to me. I just wanted to protect my mother. But Mother, she thought she could change me. She pushed me hard, pushed me to pain, and pushed me to hating her. And I even hated myself 'cause I thought that was my fault. Mother finally realized my Kaisho wouldn't change. It couldn't become beautiful like yours. So one day, Mother took me to a park. It was a cold day. It was sunny. Then she told me to wait. I waited. I waited for her to come back, not knowing that my family had gone to America. She didn't need me anymore. She had you. When I felt the pain of being abandoned for good, my Kaisho grew stronger. After years of honing this power, I told myself, one day, I'd find them and show them what they left behind. Nori. Nori! Nori. Let go of me! Listen. Listen! All right? Please. It's okay. I don't want to hurt you, Nori. I want to help you. And I can show you what you're really able to do, all right? It's okay. See? Take my hand. It's okay. See? You feel it, huh? Let me teach you. Huh? I can teach you. It's all right. It's okay. All right, come on. Come on. It's okay. Come with me. Hey, come on. Let's go. Come on. Hey. Just grab what you need. Murphy? Nori. Oh, my God, honey, are you okay? What happened? I don't know where to begin. You made the right decision. Let's do this. He wasn't going to hurt me. Yeah, sure. Let's go. Stay here. I figure we play it safe with this guy. Good luck. Mr. Oshiro, I'm Detective Murphy. Yeah, we met. Not officially. Can I ask you some questions? Yeah, go ahead. On September 1, you visited Kyoko Oshiro at the diner she works at, right? Mm-hmm, yeah, I did. Do you remember what happened that night? Oh, nothing special. I just wanted to see my mother. September 8, do you remember where you were that night? In the abandoned warehouse on Spring Street, where I killed my mother. And a few days later, I killed my grandmother in her home. Why would you kill your mother and your grandmother? Family issues. Did you love them? I loved them. I loved them, and I wanted to be loved. What did you do to them? Did you burn them? Not really. Would you care to elaborate? I could, but I bet you would not understand. Why don't you try me? Okay, it's a shame she died so young. Do you want to see her? I can show you, right here, right now. Huh? Would you please excuse me for a minute? What the hell was that? We got him. He admitted to both of the murders. But I already told you he killed them. Yeah, well, uh, he admitted it, so now we can arrest him. He's done. What happens to him? Well, he gets booked and processed. Assuming he maintains this admission of guilt, he'll go to prison. And then from there, we'll know when and how long he's locked up for. Nori, what's going on? Move, move. Sergeant, move over here with me. Get over here now. Watch the back door. Watch the back door. Go. Get out of here. Get out of here. Authorities are still gathering information on the explosion at the metropolitan police station. Lieutenant Tenwick, we're ready in 20. Let me talk to him first. I can help. No, Nori, he's too dangerous. That's not going to happen. That's my brother. This is my fault. I need to fix it. Jake, I'll ping you when we're ready, okay? Murphy. Give me a second. It's okay. Jake, I know this isn't what you want to hear, but she's right. Are you serious? We're not going to pull her in the middle of this. It's our job. We don't even know what we're dealing with here. We have to do everything we can to stop this guy, and whatever Jin's got, Nori's got it, too. Can't, sorry. Nori? Nori? Nori! Nori! Jin. Are you alone? Yes, but not for long. Jin, they're coming for you. I trusted you. Do you hear me? I trusted you. You don't deserve what happened to you, but that doesn't give you the right to kill anyone. Nori, listen. I was rescuing you, okay? It was all for you. You murdered them. Don't say that. What about those police, those paramedics? Don't say that! Jin, you have to turn yourself in. I know Mom and Obaachan were not good to you. What they did was wrong, and I'm sorry. You're just as despicable as Mother. Nori. Nori! Nori, stop! Jake? Jake? Jake, honey? Jake? Oh, God, Jake. Jake, you're okay, honey. Oh, God. You're okay. You don't have to do this. I'll go with you. It's too late. It will be nice to have family again. Are you sure you don't want me to ride with you? It's okay. I need to figure these things out. Hey, so, um, I want you to take this. It's not that much, but I think it'll help you. Thank you. Hey. You will always have a home here, okay? Okay. I'll be back.
